Walter Dunne, New York and London. The\r\n     translator was not named. The book contains a \"photogravure\" of\r\n     Niccolo Machiavelli from an engraving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nNiccolo Machiavelli, the first great Italian historian, and one of\r\nthe most eminent political writers of any age or country, was born\r\nat Florence, May 3, 1469. He was of an old though not wealthy Tuscan\r\nfamily, his father, who was a jurist, dying when Niccolo was sixteen\r\nyears old. We know nothing of Machiavelli's youth and little about\r\nhis studies. He does not seem to have received the usual humanistic\r\neducation of his time, as he knew no Greek.[*] The first notice of\r\nMachiavelli is in 1498 when we find him holding the office of Secretary\r\nin the second Chancery of the Signoria, which office he retained till\r\nthe downfall of the Florentine Republic in 1512. His unusual ability was\r\nsoon recognized, and in 1500 he was sent on a mission to Louis XII.\r\nof France, and afterward on an embassy to Cæsar Borgia, the lord of\r\nRomagna, at Urbino. Machiavelli's report and description of this and\r\nsubsequent embassies to this prince, shows his undisguised admiration\r\nfor the courage and cunning of Cæsar, who was a master in the\r\napplication of the principles afterwards exposed in such a skillful and\r\nuncompromising manner by Machiavelli in his _Prince_.\r\n\r\nThe limits of this introduction will not permit us to follow with any\r\ndetail the many important duties with which he was charged by his native\r\nstate, all of which he fulfilled with the utmost fidelity and with\r\nconsummate skill. When, after the battle of Ravenna in 1512 the holy\r\nleague determined upon the downfall of Pier Soderini, Gonfaloniere of\r\nthe Florentine Republic, and the restoration of the Medici, the efforts\r\nof Machiavelli, who was an ardent republican, were in vain; the troops\r\nhe had helped to organize fled before the Spaniards and the Medici were\r\nreturned to power. Machiavelli attempted to conciliate his new masters,\r\nbut he was deprived of his office, and being accused in the following\r\nyear of participation in the conspiracy of Boccoli and Capponi, he was\r\nimprisoned and tortured, though afterward set at liberty by Pope Leo\r\nX. He now retired to a small estate near San Casciano, seven miles from\r\nFlorence. Here he devoted himself to political and historical studies,\r\nand though apparently retired from public life, his letters show the\r\ndeep and passionate interest he took in the political vicissitudes\r\nthrough which Italy was then passing, and in all of which the singleness\r\nof purpose with which he continued to advance his native Florence, is\r\nclearly manifested. It was during his retirement upon his little estate\r\nat San Casciano that Machiavelli wrote _The Prince_, the most famous of\r\nall his writings, and here also he had begun a much more extensive work,\r\nhis _Discourses on the Decades of Livy_, which continued to occupy him\r\nfor several years. These _Discourses_, which do not form a continuous\r\ncommentary on Livy, give Machiavelli an opportunity to express his own\r\nviews on the government of the state, a task for which his long and\r\nvaried political experience, and an assiduous study of the ancients\r\nrendered him eminently qualified. The _Discourses_ and _The Prince_,\r\nwritten at the same time, supplement each other and are really one work.\r\nIndeed, the treatise, _The Art of War_, though not written till 1520\r\nshould be mentioned here because of its intimate connection with these\r\ntwo treatises, it being, in fact, a further development of some of\r\nthe thoughts expressed in the _Discorsi_. _The Prince_, a short work,\r\ndivided into twenty-six books, is the best known of all Machiavelli's\r\nwritings. Herein he expresses in his own masterly way his views on the\r\nfounding of a new state, taking for his type and model Cæsar Borgia,\r\nalthough the latter had failed in his schemes for the consolidation of\r\nhis power in the Romagna. The principles here laid down were the natural\r\noutgrowth of the confused political conditions of his time. And as in\r\nthe _Principe_, as its name indicates, Machiavelli is concerned chiefly\r\nwith the government of a Prince, so the _Discorsi_ treat principally\r\nof the Republic, and here Machiavelli's model republic was the Roman\r\ncommonwealth, the most successful and most enduring example of popular\r\ngovernment. Free Rome is the embodiment of his political idea of the\r\nstate. Much that Machiavelli says in this treatise is as true to-day and\r\nholds as good as the day it was written. And to us there is much that\r\nis of especial importance. To select a chapter almost at random, let us\r\ntake Book I., Chap. XV.: \"Public affairs are easily managed in a city\r\nwhere the body of the people is not corrupt; and where equality\r\nexists, there no principality can be established; nor can a republic be\r\nestablished where there is no equality.\"\r\n\r\nNo man has been more harshly judged than Machiavelli, especially in\r\nthe two centuries following his death. But he has since found many able\r\nchampions and the tide has turned. _The Prince_ has been termed a manual\r\nfor tyrants, the effect of which has been most pernicious. But were\r\nMachiavelli's doctrines really new? Did he discover them? He merely had\r\nthe candor and courage to write down what everybody was thinking and\r\nwhat everybody knew. He merely gives us the impressions he had received\r\nfrom a long and intimate intercourse with princes and the affairs of\r\nstate. It was Lord Bacon, I believe, who said that Machiavelli tells us\r\nwhat princes do, not what they ought to do. When Machiavelli takes Cæsar\r\nBorgia as a model, he in nowise extols him as a hero, but merely as a\r\nprince who was capable of attaining the end in view. The life of the\r\nState was the primary object. It must be maintained. And Machiavelli has\r\nlaid down the principles, based upon his study and wide experience,\r\nby which this may be accomplished. He wrote from the view-point of\r\nthe politician,--not of the moralist. What is good politics may be bad\r\nmorals, and in fact, by a strange fatality, where morals and politics\r\nclash, the latter generally gets the upper hand. And will anyone contend\r\nthat the principles set forth by Machiavelli in his _Prince_ or his\r\n_Discourses_ have entirely perished from the earth? Has diplomacy been\r\nentirely stripped of fraud and duplicity? Let anyone read the famous\r\neighteenth chapter of _The Prince_: \"In what Manner Princes should keep\r\ntheir Faith,\" and he will be convinced that what was true nearly four\r\nhundred years ago, is quite as true to-day.\r\n\r\nOf the remaining works of Machiavelli the most important is the _History\r\nof Florence_ written between 1521 and 1525, and dedicated to Clement\r\nVII. The first book is merely a rapid review of the Middle Ages, the\r\nhistory of Florence beginning with Book II. Machiavelli's method has\r\nbeen censured for adhering at times too closely to the chroniclers like\r\nVillani, Cambi, and Giovanni Cavalcanti, and at others rejecting their\r\ntestimony without apparent reason, while in its details the authority of\r\nhis _History_ is often questionable. It is the straightforward, logical\r\nnarrative, which always holds the interest of the reader that is the\r\ngreatest charm of the _History_. Of the other works of Machiavelli we\r\nmay mention here his comedies the _Mandragola_ and _Clizia_, and his\r\nnovel _Belfagor_.\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of the Republic and Machiavelli's release from prison\r\nin 1513, fortune seems never again to have favoured him. It is true that\r\nin 1520 Giuliano de' Medici commissioned him to write his _History of\r\nFlorence_, and he afterwards held a number of offices, yet these\r\nlatter were entirely beneath his merits. He had been married in 1502 to\r\nMarietta Corsini, who bore him four sons and a daughter. He died on June\r\n22, 1527, leaving his family in the greatest poverty, a sterling tribute\r\nto his honesty, when one considers the many opportunities he doubtless\r\nhad to enrich himself. Machiavelli's life was not without blemish--few\r\nlives are. We must bear in mind the atmosphere of craft, hypocrisy, and\r\npoison in which he lived,--his was the age of Cæsar Borgia and of Popes\r\nlike the monster Alexander VI. and Julius II. Whatever his faults may\r\nhave been, Machiavelli was always an ardent patriot and an earnest\r\nsupporter of popular government. It is true that he was willing to\r\naccept a prince, if one could be found courageous enough and prudent\r\nenough to unite dismembered Italy, for in the unity of his native land\r\nhe saw the only hope of its salvation.\r\n\r\nMachiavelli is buried in the church of Santa Croce at Florence, beside\r\nthe tomb of Michael Angelo. His monument bears this inscription:\r\n\r\n\"Tanto nomini nullum par eulogium.\"\r\n\r\nAnd though this praise is doubtless exaggerated, he is a son of whom his\r\ncountry may be justly proud.\r\n\r\nHugo Albert Rennert.\r\n\r\n     [*] Villari, _Niccolo Machiavelli e i suoi tempi_, 2d ed.\r\n     Milan, 1895-97, the best work on the subject.

The method\r\nadopted, when one of these provinces had to be relieved of its\r\nsuperabundant population, was to divide into three parts, each\r\ncontaining an equal number of nobles and of people, of rich and of poor.\r\nThe third upon whom the lot fell, then went in search of new abodes,\r\nleaving the remaining two-thirds in possession of their native country.\r\n\r\nThese migrating masses destroyed the Roman empire by the facilities for\r\nsettlement which the country offered when the emperors abandoned\r\nRome, the ancient seat of their dominion, and fixed their residence at\r\nConstantinople; for by this step they exposed the western empire to\r\nthe rapine of both their ministers and their enemies, the remoteness of\r\ntheir position preventing them either from seeing or providing for\r\nits necessities. To suffer the overthrow of such an extensive empire,\r\nestablished by the blood of so many brave and virtuous men, showed no\r\nless folly in the princes themselves than infidelity in their ministers;\r\nfor not one irruption alone, but many, contributed to its ruin;\r\nand these barbarians exhibited much ability and perseverance in\r\naccomplishing their object.\r\n\r\nThe first of these northern nations that invaded the empire after the\r\nCimbrians, who were conquered by Caius Marius, was the Visigoths--which\r\nname in our language signifies \"Western Goths.\" These, after some\r\nbattles fought along its confines, long held their seat of dominion upon\r\nthe Danube, with consent of the emperors; and although, moved by various\r\ncauses, they often attacked the Roman provinces, were always kept in\r\nsubjection by the imperial forces. The emperor Theodosius conquered them\r\nwith great glory; and, being wholly reduced to his power, they no longer\r\nselected a sovereign of their own, but, satisfied with the terms which\r\nhe granted them, lived and fought under his ensigns, and authority. On\r\nthe death of Theodosius, his sons Arcadius and Honorius, succeeded to\r\nthe empire, but not to the talents and fortune of their father; and\r\nthe times became changed with the princes. Theodosius had appointed a\r\ngovernor to each of the three divisions of the empire, Ruffinus to the\r\neastern, to the western Stilicho, and Gildo to the African. Each of\r\nthese, after the death of Theodosius, determined not to be governors\r\nmerely, but to assume sovereign dominion over their respective\r\nprovinces. Gildo and Ruffinus were suppressed at their outset; but\r\nStilicho, concealing his design, ingratiated himself with the new\r\nemperors, and at the same time so disturbed their government, as to\r\nfacilitate his occupation of it afterward. To make the Visigoths their\r\nenemies, he advised that the accustomed stipend allowed to this people\r\nshould be withheld; and as he thought these enemies would not\r\nbe sufficient alone to disturb the empire, he contrived that the\r\nBurgundians, Franks, Vandals, and Alans (a northern people in search of\r\nnew habitations), should assail the Roman provinces.\r\n\r\nThat they might be better able to avenge themselves for the injury\r\nthey had sustained, the Visigoths, on being deprived of their subsidy,\r\ncreated Alaric their king; and having assailed the empire, succeeded,\r\nafter many reverses, in overrunning Italy, and finally in pillaging\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nAfter this victory, Alaric died, and his successor, Astolphus, having\r\nmarried Placidia, sister of the emperors, agreed with them to go to\r\nthe relief of Gaul and Spain, which provinces had been assailed by\r\nthe Vandals, Burgundians, Alans, and Franks, from the causes before\r\nmentioned. Hence it followed, that the Vandals, who had occupied that\r\npart of Spain called Betica (now Andalusia), being pressed by the\r\nVisigoths, and unable to resist them, were invited by Boniface, who\r\ngoverned Africa for the empire, to occupy that province; for, being in\r\nrebellion, he was afraid his error would become known to the emperor.\r\nFor these reasons the Vandals gladly undertook the enterprise, and under\r\nGenseric, their king, became lords of Africa.\r\n\r\nAt this time Theodosius, son of Arcadius, succeeded to the empire; and,\r\nbestowing little attention on the affairs of the west, caused those who\r\nhad taken possession to think of securing their acquisitions. Thus the\r\nVandals ruled Africa; the Alans and Visigoths, Spain; while the Franks\r\nand Burgundians not only took Gaul, but each gave their name to the part\r\nthey occupied; hence one is called France, the other Burgundy. The good\r\nfortune of these brought fresh people to the destruction of the empire,\r\none of which, the Huns, occupied the province of Pannonia, situated upon\r\nthe nearer shore of the Danube, and which, from their name, is still\r\ncalled Hungary. To these disorders it must be added, that the emperor,\r\nseeing himself attacked on so many sides, to lessen the number of his\r\nenemies, began to treat first with the Vandals, then with the Franks;\r\na course which diminished his own power, and increased that of the\r\nbarbarians. Nor was the island of Britain, which is now called England,\r\nsecure from them; for the Britons, being apprehensive of those who had\r\noccupied Gaul, called the Angli, a people of Germany, to their aid; and\r\nthese under Vortigern their king, first defended, and then drove them\r\nfrom the island, of which they took possession, and after themselves\r\nnamed the country England. But the inhabitants, being robbed of their\r\nhome, became desperate by necessity and resolved to take possession of\r\nsome other country, although they had been unable to defend their own.\r\nThey therefore crossed the sea with their families, and settled in the\r\ncountry nearest to the beach, which from themselves is called Brittany.\r\nThe Huns, who were said above to have occupied Pannonia, joining with\r\nother nations, as the Zepidi, Eurili, Turingi, and Ostro, or eastern\r\nGoths, moved in search of new countries, and not being able to enter\r\nFrance, which was defended by the forces of the barbarians, came into\r\nItaly under Attila their king. He, a short time previously, in order to\r\npossess the entire monarchy, had murdered his brother Bleda; and having\r\nthus become very powerful, Andaric, king of the Zepidi, and Velamir,\r\nking of the Ostrogoths, became subject to him. Attila, having entered\r\nItaly, laid siege to Aquileia, where he remained without any\r\nobstacle for two years, wasting the country round, and dispersing the\r\ninhabitants. This, as will be related in its place, caused the origin\r\nof Venice. After the taking and ruin of Aquileia, he directed his course\r\ntowards Rome, from the destruction of which he abstained at the entreaty\r\nof the pontiff, his respect for whom was so great that he left Italy and\r\nretired into Austria, where he died. After the death of Attila, Velamir,\r\nking of the Ostrogoths, and the heads of the other nations, took arms\r\nagainst his sons Henry and Uric, slew the one and compelled the other,\r\nwith his Huns, to repass the Danube and return to their country; while\r\nthe Ostrogoths and the Zepidi established themselves in Pannonia, and\r\nthe Eruli and the Turingi upon the farther bank of the Danube.\r\n\r\nAttila having left Italy, Valentinian, emperor of the west, thought of\r\nrestoring the country; and, that he might be more ready to defend\r\nit against the barbarians, abandoned Rome, and removed the seat of\r\ngovernment to Ravenna. The misfortunes which befell the western empire\r\ncaused the emperor, who resided at Constantinople, on many occasions to\r\ngive up the possession of it to others, as a charge full of danger\r\nand expense; and sometimes, without his permission, the Romans, seeing\r\nthemselves so abandoned, created an emperor for their defense, or\r\nsuffered some one to usurp the dominion. This occurred at the period\r\nof which we now speak, when Maximus, a Roman, after the death of\r\nValentinian, seized the government, and compelled Eudocia, widow of the\r\nlate emperor, to take him for her husband; but she, being of imperial\r\nblood, scorned the connection of a private citizen; and being anxious to\r\navenge herself for the insult, secretly persuaded Genseric, king of the\r\nVandals and master of Africa to come to Italy, representing to him the\r\nadvantage he would derive from the undertaking, and the facility with\r\nwhich it might be accomplished. Tempted by the hope of booty, he came\r\nimmediately, and finding Rome abandoned, plundered the city during\r\nfourteen days. He also ravaged many other places in Italy, and then,\r\nloaded with wealth, withdrew to Africa. The Romans, having returned\r\nto their city, and Maximus being dead, elected Avitus, a Roman, as his\r\nsuccessor. After this, several important events occurred both in Italy\r\nand in the countries beyond; and after the deaths of many emperors\r\nthe empire of Constantinople devolved upon Zeno, and that of Rome upon\r\nOrestes and Augustulus his son, who obtained the sovereignty by fraud.\r\nWhile they were designing to hold by force what they had obtained by\r\ntreachery, the Eruli and the Turingi, who, after the death of Attila, as\r\nbefore remarked, had established themselves upon the farther bank of\r\nthe Danube, united in a league and invaded Italy under Odoacer their\r\ngeneral. Into the districts which they left unoccupied, the Longobardi\r\nor Lombards, also a northern people, entered, led by Godogo their king.\r\nOdoacer conquered and slew Orestes near Pavia, but Augustulus escaped.\r\nAfter this victory, that Rome might, with her change of power, also\r\nchange her title, Odoacer, instead of using the imperial name, caused\r\nhimself to be declared king of Rome. He was the first of those leaders\r\nwho at this period overran the world and thought of settling in Italy;\r\nfor the others, either from fear that they should not be able to hold\r\nthe country, knowing that it might easily be relieved by the eastern\r\nemperors, or from some unknown cause, after plundering her, sought other\r\ncountries wherein to establish themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nState of the Roman empire under Zeno--Theodoric king of the\r\nOstrogoths--Character of Theodoric--Changes in the Roman empire--New\r\nlanguages--New names--Theodoric dies--Belisarius in Italy--Totila takes\r\nRome--Narses destroys the Goths--New form of Government in Italy--Narses\r\ninvites the Lombards into Italy--The Lombards change the form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAt this time the ancient Roman empire was governed by the following\r\nprinces: Zeno, reigning in Constantinople, commanded the whole of the\r\neastern empire; the Ostrogoths ruled Mesia and Pannonia; the Visigoths,\r\nSuavi, and Alans, held Gascony and Spain; the Vandals, Africa; the\r\nFranks and Burgundians, France; and the Eruli and Turingi, Italy. The\r\nkingdom of the Ostrogoths had descended to Theodoric, nephew of Velamir,\r\nwho, being on terms of friendship with Zeno the eastern emperor, wrote\r\nto him that his Ostrogoths thought it an injustice that they, being\r\nsuperior in valor to the people thereabout, should be inferior to them\r\nin dominion, and that it was impossible for him to restrain them within\r\nthe limits of Pannonia. So, seeing himself under the necessity of\r\nallowing them to take arms and go in search of new abodes, he wished\r\nfirst to acquaint Zeno with it, in order that he might provide for them,\r\nby granting some country in which they might establish themselves, by\r\nhis good favor with greater propriety and convenience. Zeno, partly\r\nfrom fear and partly from a desire to drive Odoacer out of Italy, gave\r\nTheodoric permission to lead his people against him, and take possession\r\nof the country. Leaving his friends the Zepidi in Pannonia, Theodoric\r\nmarched into Italy, slew Odoacer and his son, and, moved by the same\r\nreasons which had induced Valentinian to do so, established his court at\r\nRavenna, and like Odoacer took the title of king of Italy.\r\n\r\nTheodoric possessed great talents both for war and peace; in the former\r\nhe was always conqueror, and in the latter he conferred very great\r\nbenefits upon the cities and people under him. He distributed the\r\nOstrogoths over the country, each district under its leader, that he\r\nmight more conveniently command them in war, and govern them in peace.\r\nHe enlarged Ravenna, restored Rome, and, with the exception of military\r\ndiscipline, conferred upon the Romans every honor. He kept within\r\ntheir proper bounds, wholly by the influence of his character, all the\r\nbarbarian kings who occupied the empire; he built towns and fortresses\r\nbetween the point of the Adriatic and the Alps, in order, with the\r\ngreater facility, to impede the passage of any new hordes of barbarians\r\nwho might design to assail Italy; and if, toward the latter end of his\r\nlife, so many virtues had not been sullied by acts of cruelty, caused\r\nby various jealousies of his people, such as the death of Symmachus and\r\nBoethius, men of great holiness, every point of his character would have\r\ndeserved the highest praise. By his virtue and goodness, not only\r\nRome and Italy, but every part of the western empire, freed from the\r\ncontinual troubles which they had suffered from the frequent influx\r\nof barbarians, acquired new vigor, and began to live in an orderly and\r\ncivilized manner. For surely if any times were truly miserable for\r\nItaly and the provinces overrun by the barbarians, they were those which\r\noccurred from Arcadius and Honorius to Theodoric. If we only consider\r\nthe evils which arise to a republic or a kingdom by a change of prince\r\nor of government; not by foreign interference, but by civil discord (in\r\nwhich we may see how even slight variations suffice to ruin the most\r\npowerful kingdoms or states), we may then easily imagine how much Italy\r\nand the other Roman provinces suffered, when they not only changed their\r\nforms of government and their princes, but also their laws, customs,\r\nmodes of living, religion, language, and name. Any one of such changes,\r\nby itself, without being united with others, might, with thinking of\r\nit, to say nothing of the seeing and suffering, infuse terror into the\r\nstrongest minds.\r\n\r\nFrom these causes proceeded the ruin as well as the origin and extension\r\nof many cities. Among those which were ruined were Aquileia, Luni,\r\nChiusi, Popolonia, Fiesole, and many others. The new cities were Venice,\r\nSienna, Ferrara, Aquila, with many towns and castles which for brevity\r\nwe omit. Those which became extended were Florence, Genoa, Pisa,\r\nMilan, Naples, and Bologna; to all of which may be added, the ruin and\r\nrestoration of Rome, and of many other cities not previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nFrom this devastation and new population arose new languages, as we see\r\nin the different dialects of France, Spain and Italy; which, partaking\r\nof the native idiom of the new people and of the old Roman, formed a\r\nnew manner of discourse. Besides, not only were the names of provinces\r\nchanged, but also of lakes, rivers, seas, and men; for France, Spain,\r\nand Italy are full of fresh names, wholly different from the\r\nancient; as, omitting many others, we see that the Po, the Garda, the\r\nArchipelago, are names quite different from those which the ancients\r\nused; while instead of Cæsar and Pompey we have Peter, Matthew, John,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAmong so many variations, that of religion was not of little importance;\r\nfor, while combating the customs of the ancient faith with the miracles\r\nof the new, very serious troubles and discords were created among men.\r\nAnd if the Christians had been united in one faith, fewer disorders\r\nwould have followed; but the contentions among themselves, of the\r\nchurches of Rome, Greece, and Ravenna, joined to those of the heretic\r\nsects with the Catholics, served in many ways to render the world\r\nmiserable. Africa is a proof of this; having suffered more horrors from\r\nthe Arian sect, whose doctrines were believed by the Vandals, than from\r\nany avarice or natural cruelty of the people themselves. Living amid so\r\nmany persecutions, the countenances of men bore witness of the terrible\r\nimpressions upon their minds; for besides the evils they suffered from\r\nthe disordered state of the world, they scarcely could have recourse to\r\nthe help of God, in whom the unhappy hope for relief; for the greater\r\npart of them, being uncertain what divinity they ought to address, died\r\nmiserably, without help and without hope.\r\n\r\nHaving been the first who put a stop to so many evils, Theodoric\r\ndeserves the highest praise: for during the thirty-eight years he\r\nreigned in Italy, he brought the country to such a state of greatness\r\nthat her previous sufferings were no longer recognizable. But at his\r\ndeath, the kingdom descending to Atalaric, son of Amalasontha, his\r\ndaughter, and the malice of fortune not being yet exhausted, the old\r\nevils soon returned; for Atalaric died soon after his grandfather, and\r\nthe kingdom coming into the possession of his mother, she was betrayed\r\nby Theodatus, whom she had called to assist her in the government. He\r\nput her to death and made himself king; and having thus become odious\r\nto the Ostrogoths, the emperor Justinian entertained the hope of driving\r\nhim out of Italy. Justinian appointed Belisarius to the command of this\r\nexpedition, as he had already conquered Africa, expelled the Vandals,\r\nand reduced the country to the imperial rule.\r\n\r\nBelisarius took possession of Sicily, and from thence passing into\r\nItaly, occupied Naples and Rome. The Goths, seeing this, slew Theodatus\r\ntheir king, whom they considered the cause of their misfortune, and\r\nelected Vitiges in his stead, who, after some skirmishes, was besieged\r\nand taken by Belisarius at Ravenna; but before he had time to secure\r\nthe advantages of his victory, Belisarius was recalled by Justinian, and\r\nJoannes and Vitalis were appointed in his place. Their principles and\r\npractices were so different from those of Belisarius, that the Goths\r\ntook courage and created Ildovadus, governor of Verona, their king.\r\nAfter Ildovadus, who was slain, came Totila, who routed the imperial\r\nforces, took Tuscany and Naples, and recovered nearly the whole of what\r\nBelisarius had taken from them. On this account Justinian determined to\r\nsend him into Italy again; but, coming with only a small force, he lost\r\nthe reputation which his former victories had won for him, in less time\r\nthan he had taken to acquire it. Totila being at Ostia with his forces,\r\ntook Rome before his eyes; but being unable to hold or to leave the\r\ncity, he destroyed the greater part of it, drove out the citizens, and\r\ntook the senators away from him. Thinking little of Belisarius, he led\r\nhis people into Calabria, to attack the forces which had been sent from\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nBelisarius, seeing the city abandoned, turned his mind to the\r\nperformance of an honourable work. Viewing the ruins of Rome, he\r\ndetermined to rebuild her walls and recall her inhabitants with as\r\nlittle delay as possible. But fortune was opposed to this laudable\r\nenterprise; for Justinian, being at this time assailed by the Parthians,\r\nrecalled him; and his duty to his sovereign compelled him to abandon\r\nItaly to Totila, who again took Rome, but did not treat her with\r\nsuch severity as upon the former occasion; for at the entreaty of\r\nSt. Benedict, who in those days had great reputation for sanctity, he\r\nendeavored to restore her. In the meantime, Justinian having arranged\r\nmatters with the Parthians, again thought of sending a force to the\r\nrelief of Italy; but the Sclavi, another northern people, having crossed\r\nthe Danube and attacked Illyria and Thrace, prevented him, so that\r\nTotila held almost the whole country. Having conquered the Slavonians,\r\nJustinian sent Narses, a eunuch, a man of great military talent, who,\r\nhaving arrived in Italy, routed and slew Totila. The Goths who escaped\r\nsought refuge in Pavia, where they created Teias their king. On the\r\nother hand, Narses after the victory took Rome, and coming to an\r\nengagement with Teias near Nocera, slew him and routed his army. By this\r\nvictory, the power of the Goths in Italy was quite annihilated, after\r\nhaving existed for seventy years, from the coming of Theodoric to the\r\ndeath of Teias.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Italy delivered from the Goths than Justinian died, and\r\nwas succeeded by Justin, his son, who, at the instigation of Sophia, his\r\nwife, recalled Narses, and sent Longinus in his stead. Like those who\r\npreceded him, he made his abode at Ravenna, and besides this, gave a\r\nnew form to the government of Italy; for he did not appoint governors\r\nof provinces, as the Goths had done, but in every city and town of\r\nimportance placed a ruler whom he called a duke. Neither in this\r\narrangement did he respect Rome more than the other cities; for having\r\nset aside the consuls and senate, names which up to this time had been\r\npreserved, he placed her under a duke, who was sent every year from\r\nRavenna, and called her the duchy of Rome; while to him who remained in\r\nRavenna, and governed the whole of Italy for the emperor, was given the\r\nname of Exarch. This division of the country greatly facilitated the\r\nruin of Italy, and gave the Lombards an early occasion of occupying it.\r\nNarses was greatly enraged with the emperor, for having recalled him\r\nfrom the government of the province, which he had won with his own valor\r\nand blood; while Sophia, not content with the injury done by withdrawing\r\nhim, treated him in the most offensive manner, saying she wished him\r\nto come back that he might spin with the other eunuchs. Full of\r\nindignation, Narses persuaded Alboin, king of the Lombards, who then\r\nreigned in Pannonia, to invade and take possession of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Lombards, as was said before, occupied those places upon the Danube\r\nwhich had been vacated by the Eruli and Turingi, when Odoacer their king\r\nled them into Italy; where, having been established for some time, their\r\ndominions were held by Alboin, a man ferocious and bold, under whom they\r\ncrossed the Danube, and coming to an engagement with Cunimund, king of\r\nthe Zepidi, who held Pannonia, conquered and slew him. Alboin finding\r\nRosamond, daughter of Cunimund, among the captives, took her to wife,\r\nand made himself sovereign of Pannonia; and, moved by his savage nature,\r\ncaused the skull of Cunimund to be formed into a cup, from which, in\r\nmemory of the victory, he drank. Being invited into Italy by Narses,\r\nwith whom he had been in friendship during the war with the Goths, he\r\nleft Pannonia to the Huns, who after the death of Attila had returned\r\nto their country. Finding, on his arrival, the province divided into\r\nso many parts, he presently occupied Pavia, Milan, Verona, Vicenza, the\r\nwhole of Tuscany, and the greater part of Flamminia, which is now called\r\nRomagna. These great and rapid acquisitions made him think the conquest\r\nof Italy already secured; he therefore gave a great feast at Verona, and\r\nhaving become elevated with wine, ordered the skull of Cunimund to be\r\nfilled, and caused it to be presented to the queen Rosamond, who sat\r\nopposite, saying loud enough for her to hear, that upon occasion of\r\nsuch great joy she should drink with her father. These words were like\r\na dagger to the lady's bosom and she resolved to have revenge. Knowing\r\nthat Helmichis, a noble Lombard, was in love with one of her maids, she\r\narranged with the young woman, that Helmichis, without being acquainted\r\nwith the fact, should sleep with her instead of his mistress. Having\r\neffected her design, Rosamond discovered herself to Helmichis, and gave\r\nhim the choice either of killing Alboin, and taking herself and the\r\nkingdom as his reward, or of being put to death as the ravisher of the\r\nqueen. Helmichis consented to destroy Alboin; but after the murder,\r\nfinding they could not occupy the kingdom, and fearful that the Lombards\r\nwould put them to death for the love they bore to Alboin, they seized\r\nthe royal treasure, and fled with it to Longinus, at Ravenna, who\r\nreceived them favorably.\r\n\r\nDuring these troubles the emperor Justinus died, and was succeeded by\r\nTiberius, who, occupied in the wars with the Parthians, could not attend\r\nto the affairs of Italy; and this seeming to Longinus to present an\r\nopportunity, by means of Rosamond and her wealth, of becoming king of\r\nthe Lombards and of the whole of Italy, he communicated his design\r\nto her, persuaded her to destroy Helmichis, and so take him for her\r\nhusband. To this end, having prepared poisoned wine, she with her own\r\nhand presented it to Helmichis, who complained of thirst as he came\r\nfrom the bath. Having drunk half of it, he suspected the truth, from\r\nthe unusual sensation it occasioned and compelled her to drink the\r\nremainder; so that in a few hours both came to their end, and Longinus\r\nwas deprived of the hope of becoming king.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Lombards, having drawn themselves together in Pavia,\r\nwhich was become the principal seat of their empire, made Clefis their\r\nking. He rebuilt Imola, destroyed by Narses, and occupied Remini\r\nand almost every place up to Rome; but he died in the course of his\r\nvictories. Clefis was cruel to such a degree, not only toward strangers,\r\nbut to his own Lombards, that these people, sickened of royal power, did\r\nnot create another king, but appointed among themselves thirty dukes to\r\ngovern the rest. This prevented the Lombards from occupying the whole\r\nof Italy, or of extending their dominion further than Benevento; for, of\r\nthe cities of Rome, Ravenna, Cremona, Mantua, Padua, Monselice, Parma,\r\nBologna, Faenza, Forli, and Cesena, some defended themselves for a time,\r\nand others never fell under their dominion; since, not having a king,\r\nthey became less prompt for war, and when they afterward appointed one,\r\nthey were, by living in freedom, become less obedient, and more apt to\r\nquarrel among themselves; which from the first prevented a fortunate\r\nissue of their military expeditions, and was the ultimate cause of their\r\nbeing driven out of Italy. The affairs of the Lombards being in the\r\nstate just described, the Romans and Longinus came to an agreement with\r\nthem, that each should lay down their arms and enjoy what they already\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nBeginning of the greatness of the pontiffs in Italy--Abuse of censures\r\nand indulgences--The pope applies to Pepin, king of France, for\r\nassistance--Donation of Pepin to the pontiff--Charlemagne--End of the\r\nkingdom of the Lombards--The title of cardinal begins to be used--The\r\nempire passes to the Germans--Berengarius, duke of Fruili, created\r\nking of Italy--Pisa becomes great--Order and division of the states of\r\nItaly--Electors of the emperor created.\r\n\r\nIn these times the popes began to acquire greater temporal authority\r\nthan they had previously possessed; although the immediate successors of\r\nSt. Peter were more reverenced for the holiness of their lives, and the\r\nmiracles which they performed; and their example so greatly extended the\r\nChristian religion, that princes of other states embraced it, in order\r\nto obviate the confusion which prevailed at that period. The emperor\r\nhaving become a Christian and returned to Constantinople, it followed,\r\nas was remarked at the commencement of the book, that the Roman empire\r\nwas the more easily ruined, and the church more rapidly increased her\r\nauthority. Nevertheless, the whole of Italy, being subject either to the\r\nemperors or the kings till the coming of the Lombards, the popes never\r\nacquired any greater authority than what reverence for their habits and\r\ndoctrine gave them. In other respects they obeyed the emperors or kings;\r\nofficiated for them in their affairs, as ministers or agents, and were\r\neven sometimes put to death by them. He who caused them to become of\r\nmore importance in the affairs of Italy, was Theodoric, king of the\r\nGoths, when he established the seat of his empire at Ravenna; for, Rome\r\nbeing without a prince, the Romans found it necessary, for their safety,\r\nto yield obedience to the pope; his authority, however, was not greatly\r\nincreased thereby, the only advantage being, that the church of Rome was\r\nallowed to take precedence of that of Ravenna. But the Lombards having\r\ntaken possession, and Italy being divided into many parts, the pope had\r\nan opportunity of greater exertion. Being as it were the head of Rome,\r\nboth the emperor of Constantinople and the Lombards respected him; so\r\nthat the Romans, by his means, entered into league with the Lombards,\r\nand with Longinus, not as subjects, but as equals. Thus the popes,\r\nat one time friends of the Greeks, and at another of the Lombards,\r\nincreased their own power; but upon the ruin of the eastern empire,\r\nwhich occurred during the time of Heraclius, their influence was\r\nreduced; for the Sclavi, of whom we spoke before, again assailed\r\nIllyria, and having occupied the country, named it Sclavonia, after\r\nthemselves; and the other parts were attacked by the Persians, then by\r\nthe Saracens under Mohammed, and lastly by the Turks, who took Syria,\r\nAfrica, and Egypt. These causes induced the reigning pope, in his\r\ndistress, to seek new friends, and he applied to the king of France.\r\nNearly all the wars which the northern barbarians carried on in Italy,\r\nit may be here remarked, were occasioned by the pontiffs; and the\r\nhordes, with which the country was inundated, were generally called in\r\nby them. The same mode of proceeding still continued, and kept Italy\r\nweak and unsettled. And, therefore, in relating the events which have\r\ntaken place from those times to the present, the ruin of the empire will\r\nbe no longer illustrated, but only the increase of the pontificate and\r\nof the other principalities which ruled Italy till the coming of Charles\r\nVIII. It will be seen how the popes, first with censures, and afterward\r\nwith these and arms, mingled with indulgences, became both terrible and\r\nvenerable; and how, from having abused both, they ceased to possess\r\nany influence, and were wholly dependent on the will of others for\r\nassistance in their wars.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the order of our narration. Gregory III. occupied the\r\npapacy, and the kingdom of the Lombards was held by Astolphus, who,\r\ncontrary to agreement, seized Ravenna, and made war upon the pope.\r\nOn this account, Gregory no longer relying upon the emperor of\r\nConstantinople, since he, for the reasons above given, was unable to\r\nassist him, and unwilling to trust the Lombards, for they had frequently\r\nbroken their faith, had recourse to Pepin II., who, from being lord of\r\nAustria and Brabant, had become king of France; not so much by his\r\nown valor as by that of Charles Martel, his father, and Pepin his\r\ngrandfather; for Charles Martel, being governor of the kingdom, effected\r\nthe memorable defeat of the Saracens near Tours, upon the Loire, in\r\nwhich two hundred thousand of them are said to have been left dead upon\r\nthe field of battle. Hence, Pepin, by his father's reputation and his\r\nown abilities, became afterward king of France. To him Pope Gregory, as\r\nwe have said, applied for assistance against the Lombards, which Pepin\r\npromised to grant, but desired first to see him and be honored with his\r\npresence. Gregory accordingly went to France, passing uninjured through\r\nthe country of his enemies, so great was the respect they had for\r\nreligion, and was treated honorably by Pepin, who sent an army into\r\nItaly, and besieged the Lombards in Pavia. King Astolphus, compelled by\r\nnecessity, made proposals of peace to the French, who agreed to them at\r\nthe entreaty of the pope--for he did not desire the death of his enemy,\r\nbut that he should be converted and live. In this treaty, Astolphus\r\npromised to give to the church all the places he had taken from her;\r\nbut the king's forces having returned to France, he did not fulfill the\r\nagreement, and the pope again had recourse to Pepin, who sent another\r\narmy, conquered the Lombards, took Ravenna, and, contrary to the wishes\r\nof the Greek emperor, gave it to the pope, with all the places that\r\nbelonged to the exarchate, and added to them Urbino and the Marca.\r\nBut Astolphus, while fulfilling the terms of his agreement, died, and\r\nDesiderius, a Lombard, who was duke of Tuscany, took up arms to occupy\r\nthe kingdom, and demanded assistance of the pope, promising him\r\nhis friendship. The pope acceding to his request, the other princes\r\nassented. Desiderius kept faith at first, and proceeded to resign the\r\ndistricts to the pope, according to the agreement made with Pepin, so\r\nthat an exarch was no longer sent from Constantinople to Ravenna, but it\r\nwas governed according to the will of the pope. Pepin soon after died,\r\nand was succeeded by his son Charles, the same who, on account of the\r\nmagnitude and success of his enterprises, was called Charlemagne, or\r\nCharles the Great. Theodore I. now succeeded to the papacy, and discord\r\narising between him and Desiderius, the latter besieged him in Rome.\r\nThe pope requested assistance of Charles, who, having crossed the Alps,\r\nbesieged Desiderius in Pavai, where he took both him and his children,\r\nand sent them prisoners to France. He then went to visit the pontiff at\r\nRome, where he declared, THAT THE POPE, BEING VICAR OF GOD, COULD NOT\r\nBE JUDGED BY MEN. The pope and the people of Rome made him emperor; and\r\nthus Rome began to have an emperor of the west. And whereas the popes\r\nused to be established by the emperors, the latter now began to have\r\nneed of the popes at their elections; the empire continued to lose\r\nits powers, while the church acquired them; and, by these means, she\r\nconstantly extended her authority over temporal princes.\r\n\r\nThe Lombards, having now been two hundred and thirty-two years in the\r\ncountry, were strangers only in name, and Charles, wishing to reorganize\r\nthe states of Italy, consented that they should occupy the places in\r\nwhich they had been brought up, and call the province after their own\r\nname, Lombardy. That they might be led to respect the Roman name, he\r\nordered all that part of Italy adjoining to them, which had been under\r\nthe exarchate of Ravenna, to be called Romagna. Besides this, he created\r\nhis son Pepin, king of Italy, whose dominion extended to Benevento; all\r\nthe rest being possessed by the Greek emperor, with whom Charles was\r\nin league. About this time Pascal I. occupied the pontificate, and\r\nthe priests of the churches of Rome, from being near to the pope, and\r\nattending the elections of the pontiff, began to dignify their own power\r\nwith a title, by calling themselves cardinals, and arrogated so great\r\nauthority, that having excluded the people of Rome from the election\r\nof pontiff, the appointment of a new pope was scarcely ever made except\r\nfrom one of their own number: thus on the death of Pascal, the cardinal\r\nof St. Sabina was created pope by the title of Eugenius II. Italy having\r\ncome into the hands of the French, a change of form and order took\r\nplace, the popes acquiring greater temporal power, and the new\r\nauthorities adopting the titles of count and marquis, as that of duke\r\nhad been introduced by Longinus, exarch of Ravenna. After the deaths of\r\nsome pontiffs, Osporco, a Roman, succeeded to the papacy; but on account\r\nof his unseemly appellation, he took the name of Sergius, and this was\r\nthe origin of that change of names which the popes adopt upon their\r\nelection to the pontificate.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Emperor Charles died and was succeeded by Lewis\r\n(the Pious), after whose death so many disputes arose among his sons,\r\nthat at the time of his grandchildren, the house of France lost the\r\nempire, which then came to the Germans; the first German emperor being\r\ncalled Arnolfus. Nor did the Carlovingian family lose the empire only;\r\ntheir discords also occasioned them the loss of Italy; for the Lombards,\r\ngathering strength, offended the pope and the Romans, and Arnolfo, not\r\nknowing where to seek relief, was compelled to create Berengarius, duke\r\nof Fruili, king of Italy. These events induced the Huns, who occupied\r\nPannonia, to assail Italy; but, in an engagement with Berengarius, they\r\nwere compelled to return to Pannonia, which had from them been named\r\nHungary.\r\n\r\nRomano was at this time emperor of Greece, having, while prefect of\r\nthe army, dethroned Constantine; and as Puglia and Calabria, which, as\r\nbefore observed, were parts of the Greek empire, had revolted, he\r\ngave permission to the Saracans to occupy them; and they having taken\r\npossession of these provinces, besieged Rome. The Romans, Berengarius\r\nbeing then engaged in defending himself against the Huns, appointed\r\nAlberic, duke of Tuscany, their leader. By his valor Rome was saved from\r\nthe Saracens, who, withdrawing from the siege, erected a fortress upon\r\nMount Gargano, by means of which they governed Puglia and Calabria,\r\nand harassed the whole country. Thus Italy was in those times very\r\ngrievously afflicted, being in constant warfare with the Huns in the\r\ndirection of the Alps, and, on the Neapolitan side, suffering from the\r\ninroads of the Saracens. This state of things continued many years,\r\noccupying the reigns of three Berengarii, who succeeded each other; and\r\nduring this time the pope and the church were greatly disturbed; the\r\nimpotence of the eastern, and the disunion which prevailed among the\r\nwestern princes, leaving them without defense. The city of Genoa, with\r\nall her territory upon the rivers, having been overrun by the Saracens,\r\nan impulse was thus given to the rising greatness of Pisa, in which city\r\nmultitudes took refuge who had been driven out of their own country.\r\nThese events occurred in the year 931, when Otho, duke of Saxony, the\r\nson of Henry and Matilda, a man of great prudence and reputation, being\r\nmade emperor, the pope Agapito, begged that he would come into Italy and\r\nrelieve him from the tyranny of the Berengarii.\r\n\r\nThe States of Italy were governed in this manner: Lombardy was under\r\nBerengarius III. and Alfred his son; Tuscany and Romagna were governed\r\nby a deputy of the western emperor; Puglia and Calabria were partly\r\nunder the Greek emperor, and partly under the Saracens; in Rome two\r\nconsuls were annually chosen from the nobility, who governed her\r\naccording to ancient custom; to these was added a prefect, who dispensed\r\njustice among the people; and there was a council of twelve, who each\r\nyear appointed rectors for the places subject to them. The popes had\r\nmore or less authority in Rome and the rest of Italy, in proportion as\r\nthey were favorites of the emperor or of the most powerful states. The\r\nEmperor Otho came into Italy, took the kingdom from the Berengarii, in\r\nwhich they had reigned fifty-five years, and reinstated the pontiff in\r\nhis dignity. He had a son and a nephew, each named Otho, who, one after\r\nthe other, succeeded to the empire. In the reign of Otho III., Pope\r\nGregory V. was expelled by the Romans; whereupon the emperor came into\r\nItaly and replaced him; and the pope, to revenge himself on the Romans,\r\ntook from them the right to create an emperor, and gave it to three\r\nprinces and three bishops of Germany; the princes of Brandenburg,\r\nPalatine, and Saxony, and the bishops of Magonza, Treveri, and Colonia.\r\nThis occurred in the year 1002. After the death of Otho III. the\r\nelectors created Henry, duke of Bavaria, emperor, who at the end of\r\ntwelve years was crowned by Pope Stephen VIII. Henry and his wife\r\nSimeonda were persons of very holy life, as is seen by the many temples\r\nbuilt and endowed by them, of which the church of St. Miniato, near\r\nFlorence, is one. Henry died in 1024, and was succeeded by Conrad of\r\nSuabia; and the latter by Henry II., who came to Rome; and as there was\r\na schism in the church of three popes, he set them all aside, and caused\r\nthe election of Clement II., by whom he was crowned emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nNicholas II. commits the election of the pope to the cardinals--First\r\nexample of a prince deprived of his dominions by the pope--Guelphs and\r\nGhibellines--Establishment of the kingdom of Naples--Pope Urban II. goes\r\nto France--The first crusade--New orders of knighthood--Saladin takes\r\nfrom the Christians their possessions in the east--Death of the Countess\r\nMatilda--Character of Frederick Barbarossa--Schism--Frederick creates\r\nan anti-pope--Building of Alexandria in Puglia--Disgraceful conditions\r\nimposed by the pope upon Henry, king of England--Reconciliation\r\nof Frederick with the pope--The kingdom of Naples passes to the\r\nGermans--Orders of St. Dominic and St. Francis.\r\n\r\nItaly was at this time governed partly by the people, some districts\r\nby their own princes, and others by the deputies of the emperor. The\r\nhighest in authority, and to whom the others referred, was called the\r\nchancellor. Of the princes, the most powerful were Godfred and the\r\nCountess Matilda his wife, who was daughter of Beatrice, the sister of\r\nHenry II. She and her husband possessed Lucca, Parma, Reggio, Mantua,\r\nand the whole of what is now called THE PATRIMONY OF THE CHURCH. The\r\nambition of the Roman people caused many wars between them and the\r\npontiffs, whose authority had previously been used to free them from\r\nthe emperors; but when they had taken the government of the city to\r\nthemselves, and regulated it according to their own pleasure, they at\r\nonce became at enmity with the popes, who received far more injuries\r\nfrom them than from any Christian potentate. And while the popes caused\r\nall the west to tremble with their censures, the people of Rome were\r\nin open rebellion against them; nor had they or the popes any other\r\npurpose, but to deprive each other of reputation and authority.\r\n\r\nNicholas II. now attained the papacy; and as Gregory V. had taken\r\nfrom the Romans the right to create an emperor, he in the same manner\r\ndetermined to deprive them of their share in the election of the pope;\r\nand confined the creation to the cardinals alone. Nor did this satisfy\r\nhim; for, having agreed with the princes who governed Calabria and\r\nPuglia, with methods which we shall presently relate, he compelled the\r\nofficers whom the Romans appointed to their different jurisdictions,\r\nto render obedience to him; and some of them he even deprived of their\r\noffices. After the death of Nicholas, there was a schism in the church;\r\nthe clergy of Lombardy refused obedience to Alexander II., created at\r\nRome, and elected Cadolo of Parma anti-pope; and Henry, who hated\r\nthe power of the pontiffs, gave Alexander to understand that he must\r\nrenounce the pontificate, and ordered the cardinals to go into Germany\r\nto appoint a new pope. He was the first who felt the importance of\r\nspiritual weapons; for the pope called a council at Rome, and deprived\r\nHenry of both the empire and the kingdom. Some of the people of Italy\r\ntook the part of the pope, others of Henry; and hence arose the factions\r\nof the Guelphs and the Ghibellines; that Italy, relieved from the\r\ninundations of barbarians, might be distracted with intestine strife.\r\nHenry, being excommunicated, was compelled by his people to come into\r\nItaly, and fall barefooted upon his knees before the pope, and ask his\r\npardon. This occurred in the year 1082. Nevertheless, there shortly\r\nafterward arose new discords between the pope and Henry; upon which the\r\npope again excommunicated him, and the emperor sent his son, also named\r\nHenry, with an army to Rome, and he, with the assistance of the Romans,\r\nwho hated the pope, besieged him in the fortress. Robert Guiscard them\r\ncame from Puglia to his relief, but Henry had left before his arrival,\r\nand returned to Germany. The Romans stood out alone, and the city was\r\nsacked by Robert, and reduced to ruins. As from this Robert sprung the\r\nestablishment of the kingdom of Naples, it seems not superfluous to\r\nrelate particularly his actions and origin.\r\n\r\nDisunion having arisen among the descendants of Charlemagne, occasion\r\nwas given to another northern people, called Normans, to assail France\r\nand occupy that portion of the country which is now named Normandy. A\r\npart of these people came into Italy at the time when the province was\r\ninfested with the Berengarii, the Saracans, and the Huns, and occupied\r\nsome places in Romagna, where, during the wars of that period, they\r\nconducted themselves valiantly. Tancred, one of these Norman princes,\r\nhad many children; among the rest were William, surnamed Ferabac, and\r\nRobert, called Guiscard. When the principality was governed by William,\r\nthe troubles of Italy were in some measure abated; but the Saracens\r\nstill held Sicily, and plundered the coasts of Italy daily. On this\r\naccount William arranged with the princes of Capua and Salerno, and\r\nwith Melorco, a Greek, who governed Puglia and Calabria for the\r\nGreek emperor, to attack Sicily; and it was agreed that, if they\r\nwere victorious, each should have a fourth part of the booty and\r\nthe territory. They were fortunate in their enterprise, expelled the\r\nSaracens, and took possession of the island; but, after the victory,\r\nMelorco secretly caused forces to be brought from Greece, seized Sicily\r\nin the name of the emperor, and appropriated the booty to himself and\r\nhis followers. William was much dissatisfied with this, but reserved\r\nthe exhibition of his displeasure for a suitable opportunity, and left\r\nSicily with the princes of Salerno and Capua. But when they had parted\r\nfrom him to return to their homes, instead of proceeding to Romagna he\r\nled his people towards Puglia, and took Melfi; and from thence, in a\r\nshort time, recovered from the Greek emperor almost the whole of Puglia\r\nand Calabria, over which provinces, in the time of pope Nicholas II. his\r\nbrother Robert Guiscard was sovereign. Robert having had many disputes\r\nwith his nephews for the inheritance of these states, requested the\r\ninfluence of the pope to settle them; which his holiness was very\r\nwilling to afford, being anxious to make a friend of Robert, to defend\r\nhimself against the emperor of Germany and the insolence of the Roman\r\npeople, which indeed shortly followed, when, at the instance of Gregory,\r\nhe drove Henry from Rome, and subdued the people. Robert was succeeded\r\nby his sons Roger and William, to whose dominion not only was Naples\r\nadded, but all the places interjacent as far as Rome, and afterward\r\nSicily, of which Roger became sovereign; but, upon William going to\r\nConstantinople, to marry the daughter of the emperor, his dominions\r\nwere wrested from him by his brother Roger. Inflated with so great an\r\nacquisition, Roger first took the title of king of Italy, but afterward\r\ncontented himself with that of king of Puglia and Sicily. He was the\r\nfirst who established and gave that name to this kingdom, which still\r\nretains its ancient boundaries, although its sovereigns have been of\r\nmany families and countries. Upon the failure of the Normans, it came to\r\nthe Germans, after these to the French, then to the Aragonese, and it is\r\nnow held by the Flemish.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Urban II. became pope and excited the hatred of the\r\nRomans. As he did not think himself safe even in Italy, on account of\r\nthe disunion which prevailed, he directed his thoughts to a generous\r\nenterprise. With his whole clergy he went into France, and at Anvers,\r\nhaving drawn together a vast multitude of people, delivered an oration\r\nagainst the infidels, which so excited the minds of his audience, that\r\nthey determined to undertake the conquest of Asia from the Saracens;\r\nwhich enterprise, with all those of a similar nature, were afterward\r\ncalled crusades, because the people who joined in them bore upon their\r\narmor and apparel the figure of a cross. The leaders were Godfrey,\r\nEustace, and Baldwin of Bouillon, counts of Boulogne, and Peter, a\r\nhermit celebrated for his prudence and sagacity. Many kings and people\r\njoined them, and contributed money; and many private persons fought\r\nunder them at their own expense; so great was the influence of religion\r\nin those days upon the minds of men, excited by the example of those\r\nwho were its principal ministers. The proudest successes attended the\r\nbeginning of this enterprise; for the whole of Asia Minor, Syria, and\r\npart of Egypt, fell under the power of the Christians. To commemorate\r\nthese events the order of the Knights of Jerusalem was created, which\r\nstill continues, and holds the island of Rhodes--the only obstacle to\r\nthe power of the Mohammedans. The same events gave rise to the order\r\nof the Knights Templars, which, after a short time, on account of\r\ntheir shameless practices, was dissolved. Various fortunes attended\r\nthe crusaders in the course of their enterprises, and many nations\r\nand individuals became celebrated accordingly. The kings of France\r\nand England joined them, and, with the Venetians, Pisans, and Genoese,\r\nacquired great reputation, till the time of Saladin, when, by whose\r\ntalents, and the disagreement of the Christians among themselves,\r\nthe crusaders were robbed of all that glory which they had at first\r\nacquired; and, after ninety years, were driven from those places which\r\nthey had so honorably and happily recovered.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Urban, Pascal II. became pope, and the empire was\r\nunder the dominion of Henry IV. who came to Rome pretending friendship\r\nfor the pontiff but afterward put his holiness and all his clergy in\r\nprison; nor did he release them till it was conceded that he should\r\ndispose of the churches of Germany according to his own pleasure. About\r\nthis time, the Countess Matilda died, and made the church heir to all\r\nher territories. After the deaths of Pascal and Henry IV. many popes and\r\nemperors followed, till the papacy was occupied by Alexander III. and\r\nthe empire by Frederick, surnamed Barbarossa. The popes during this\r\nperiod had met with many difficulties from the people of Rome and\r\nthe emperors; and in the time of Barbarossa they were much increased.\r\nFrederick possessed military talent, but was so full of pride that he\r\nwould not submit to the pontiff. However, at his election to the empire\r\nhe came to Rome to be crowned, and returned peaceably to Germany, where\r\nhe did not long remain in the same mind, but came again into Italy to\r\nsubdue certain places in Lombardy, which did not obey him. It happened\r\nat this time that the cardinal St. Clement, of a Roman family, separated\r\nfrom Alexander, and was made pope by some of the cardinals. The Emperor\r\nFrederick, being encamped at Cerma, Alexander complained to him of the\r\nanti-pope, and received for answer, that they were both to go to him,\r\nand, having heard each side, he would determine which was the true pope.\r\nThis reply displeased Alexander; and, as he saw the emperor was inclined\r\nto favor the anti-pope, he excommunicated him, and then fled to Philip,\r\nking of France. Frederick, in the meantime, carrying on the war in\r\nLombardy, destroyed Milan; which caused the union of Verona, Padua, and\r\nVicenza against him for their common defense. About the same period the\r\nanti-pope died, and Frederick set up Guido of Cremona, in his stead.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, from the absence of the pope, and from the emperor being\r\nin Lombardy, had reacquired some authority in Rome, and proceeded to\r\nrecover the obedience of those places which had been subject to them.\r\nAnd as the people of Tusculum refused to submit to their authority, they\r\nproceeded against them with their whole force; but these, being assisted\r\nby Frederick, routed the Roman army with such dreadful slaughter,\r\nthat Rome was never after either so populous or so rich. Alexander now\r\nreturned to the city, thinking he could be safe there on account of\r\nthe enmity subsisting between the Romans and the emperor, and from the\r\nenemies which the latter had in Lombardy. But Frederick, setting aside\r\nevery other consideration, led his forces and encamped before Rome; and\r\nAlexander fled to William, king of Puglia, who had become hair of that\r\nkingdom after the death of Roger. Frederick, however, withdrew from Rome\r\non account of the plague which then prevailed, and returned to Germany.\r\nThe cities of Lombardy in league against him, in order to command Pavia\r\nand Tortona, which adhered to the imperial party, built a city, to be\r\ntheir magazine in time of war, and named in Alexandria, in honor of the\r\npope and in contempt of Frederick.\r\n\r\nGuido the anti-pope died, and Giovanni of Fermo was appointed in his\r\nstead, who, being favored by the imperialists, lived at Montefiascone.\r\nPope Alexander being at Tusculum, whither he had been called by the\r\ninhabitants, that with his authority he might defend them from the\r\nRomans, ambassadors came to him from Henry, king of England, to signify\r\nthat he was not blamable for the death of Thomas à Becket, archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, although public report had slandered him with it. On this\r\nthe pope sent two cardinals to England, to inquire into the truth of\r\nthe matter; and although they found no actual charge against the king,\r\nstill, on account of the infamy of the crime, and for not having honored\r\nthe archbishop so much as he deserved, the sentence against the king of\r\nEngland was, that having called together the barons of his empire,\r\nhe should upon oath before them affirm his innocence; that he should\r\nimmediately send two hundred soldiers to Jerusalem, paid for one year;\r\nthat, before the end of three years, he should himself proceed thither\r\nwith as large an army as he could draw together; that his subjects\r\nshould have the power of appealing to Rome when they thought proper;\r\nand that he should annul whatever acts had been passed in his kingdom\r\nunfavorable to ecclesiastical rule. These terms were all accepted by\r\nHenry; and thus a great king submitted to a sentence that in our day a\r\nprivate person would have been ashamed of. But while the pope exercised\r\nso great authority over distant princes, he could not compel obedience\r\nfrom the Romans themselves, or obtain their consent that he should\r\nremain in Rome, even though he promised to intermeddle only with\r\necclesiastical affairs.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Frederick returned to Italy, and while he was preparing\r\nto carry on new wars against the pope, his prelates and barons declared\r\nthat they would abandon him unless he reconciled himself with the\r\nchurch; so that he was obliged to go and submit to the pope at Venus,\r\nwhere a pacification was effected, but in which the pope deprived the\r\nemperor of all authority over Rome, and named William, king of Sicily\r\nand Puglia, a coadjutor with him. Frederick, unable to exist without\r\nwar, joined the crusaders in Asia, that he might exercise that ambition\r\nagainst Mohammed, which he could not gratify against the vicars of\r\nChrist. And being near the river Cydnus, tempted by the clearness of\r\nits waters, bathed therein, took cold, and died. Thus the river did a\r\ngreater favor to the Mohammedans than the pope's excommunications had\r\ndone to the Christians; for the latter only checked his pride, while the\r\nformer finished his career. Frederick being dead, the pope had now\r\nonly to suppress the contumacy of the Romans; and, after many disputes\r\nconcerning the creation of consuls, it was agreed that they should\r\nelect them as they had been accustomed to do, but that these should not\r\nundertake the office, till they had first sworn to be faithful to the\r\nchurch. This agreement being made, Giovanni the anti-pope took refuge in\r\nMount Albano, where he shortly afterward died. William, king of Naples,\r\ndied about the same time, and the pope intended to occupy that kingdom\r\non the ground that the king had left only a natural son named Tancred.\r\nBut the barons would not consent, and wished that Tancred should be\r\nking. Celestine III., the then pope, anxious to snatch the kingdom from\r\nthe hands of Tancred, contrived that Henry, son of Frederick should be\r\nelected emperor, and promised him the kingdom on the condition that he\r\nshould restore to the church all the places that had belonged to her. To\r\nfacilitate this affair, he caused Gostanza, a daughter of William, who\r\nhad been placed in a monastery and was now old, to be brought from\r\nher seclusion and become the wife of Henry. Thus the kingdom of Naples\r\npassed from the Normans, who had been the founders of it, to the\r\nGermans. As soon as the affairs of Germany were arranged, the Emperor\r\nHenry came into Italy with Gostanza his wife, and a son about four years\r\nof age named Frederick; and, as Tancred was now dead, leaving only\r\nan infant named Roger, he took possession of the kingdom without much\r\ndifficulty. After some years, Henry died in Sicily, and was succeeded in\r\nthe kingdom by Frederick, and in the empire by Otho, duke of Saxony, who\r\nwas elected through the influence of Innocent III. But as soon as he had\r\ntaken the crown, contrary to the general expectation, he became an enemy\r\nof the pope, occupied Romagna, and prepared to attack the kingdom. On\r\nthis account the pope excommunicated him; he was abandoned by every one,\r\nand the electors appointed Frederick, king of Naples, emperor in his\r\nstead. Frederick came to Rome for his coronation; but the pope, being\r\nafraid of his power, would not crown him, and endeavored to withdraw him\r\nfrom Italy as he had done Otho. Frederick returned to Germany in anger,\r\nand, after many battles with Otho, at length conquered him. Meanwhile,\r\nInnocent died, who, besides other excellent works, built the hospital of\r\nthe Holy Ghost at Rome. He was succeeded by Honorius III., in whose time\r\nthe religious orders of St. Dominic and St. Francis were founded, 1218.\r\nHonorius crowned Frederick, to whom Giovanni, descended from Baldwin,\r\nking of Jerusalem, who commanded the remainder of the Christian army in\r\nAsia and still held that title, gave a daughter in marriage; and, with\r\nher portion, conceded to him the title to that kingdom: hence it is that\r\nevery king of Naples is called king of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe state of Italy--Beginning of the greatness of the house of\r\nEste--Guelphs and Ghibellines--Death of the Emperor Frederick\r\nII.--Manfred takes possession of the kingdom of Naples--Movements of the\r\nGuelphs and Ghibellines in Lombardy--Charles of Anjou invested by the\r\npope with the kingdom of Naples and Sicily--Restless policy of\r\nthe popes--Ambitious views of pope Nicholas III.--Nephews of the\r\npopes--Sicilian vespers--The Emperor Rodolph allows many cities to\r\npurchase their independence--Institution of the jubilee--The popes at\r\nAvignon.\r\n\r\nAt this time the states of Italy were governed in the following manner:\r\nthe Romans no longer elected consuls, but instead of them, and with the\r\nsame powers, they appointed one senator, and sometimes more. The league\r\nwhich the cities of Lombardy had formed against Frederick Barbarossa\r\nstill continued, and comprehended Milan, Brescia, Mantua, and the\r\ngreater number of the cities of Romagna, together with Verona, Vicenza,\r\nPadua, and Trevisa. Those which took part with the emperor, were\r\nCremona, Bergamo, Parma, Reggio, and Trento. The other cities and\r\nfortresses of Lombardy, Romagna, and the march of Trevisa, favored,\r\naccording to their necessities, sometimes one party, sometimes the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Otho III. there had come into Italy a man called Ezelin,\r\nwho, remaining in the country, had a son, and he too had a son named\r\nEzelin. This person, being rich and powerful, took part with Frederick,\r\nwho, as we have said, was at enmity with the pope; Frederick, at the\r\ninstigation and with the assistance of Ezelin, took Verona and Mantua,\r\ndestroyed Vicenza, occupied Padua, routed the army of the united cities,\r\nand then directed his course towards Tuscany. Ezelin, in the meantime,\r\nhad subdued the whole of the Trevisian March, but could not prevail\r\nagainst Ferrara, which was defended by Azone da Este and the forces\r\nwhich the pope had in Lombardy; and, as the enemy were compelled to\r\nwithdraw, the pope gave Ferrara in fee to this Azone, from whom are\r\ndescended those who now govern that city. Frederick halted at Pisa,\r\ndesirous of making himself lord of Tuscany; but, while endeavoring to\r\ndiscover what friends and foes he had in that province, he scattered so\r\nmany seeds of discord as occasioned the ruin of Italy; for the factions\r\nof the Guelphs and Ghibellines multiplied,--those who supported the\r\nchurch taking the name of Guelphs, while the followers of the emperor\r\nwere called Ghibellines, these names being first heard at Pistoia.\r\nFrederick, marching from Pisa, assailed and wasted the territories\r\nof the church in a variety of ways; so that the pope, having no other\r\nremedy, unfurled against him the banner of the cross, as his predecessor\r\nhad done against the Saracens. Frederick, that he might be suddenly\r\nabandoned by his people, as Frederick Barbarossa and others had been,\r\ntook into his pay a number of Saracens; and to bind them to him, and\r\nestablish in Italy a firm bulwark against the church, without fear of\r\npapal maledictions, he gave them Nocera in the kingdom of Naples, that,\r\nhaving a refuge of their own, they might be placed in greater security.\r\nThe pontificate was now occupied by Innocent IV., who, being in fear\r\nof Frederick, went to Genoa, and thence to France, where he appointed a\r\ncouncil to be held at Lyons, where it was the intention of Frederick\r\nto attend, but he was prevented by the rebellion of Parma: and, being\r\nrepulsed, he went into Tuscany, and from thence to Sicily, where he\r\ndied, leaving his son Conrad in Suabia; and in Puglia, Manfred, whom he\r\nhad created duke of Benevento, born of a concubine. Conrad came to take\r\npossession of the kingdom, and having arrived at Naples, died, leaving\r\nan infant son named Corradino, who was then in Germany. On this\r\naccount Manfred occupied the state, first as guardian of Corradino, but\r\nafterward, causing a report to be circulated that Corradino had died,\r\nmade himself king, contrary to the wishes of both the pope and the\r\nNeapolitans, who, however, were obliged to submit.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were occurring in the kingdom of Naples, many\r\nmovements took place in Lombardy between the Guelphs and the\r\nGhibellines. The Guelphs were headed by a legate of the pope; and the\r\nGhibelline party by Ezelin, who possessed nearly the whole of Lombardy\r\nbeyond the Po; and, as in the course of the war Padua rebelled, he\r\nput to death twelve thousand of its citizens. But before its close he\r\nhimself was slain, in the eightieth year of his age, and all the places\r\nhe had held became free. Manfred, king of Naples, continued those\r\nenmities against the church which had been begun by his ancestors,\r\nand kept the pope, Urban IV., in continual alarm; so that, in order to\r\nsubdue him, Urban summoned the crusaders, and went to Perugia to await\r\ntheir arrival. Seeing them few and slow in their approach, he found\r\nthat more able assistance was necessary to conquer Manfred. He therefore\r\nsought the favor of France; created Louis of Anjou, the king's brother,\r\nsovereign of Naples and Sicily, and excited him to come into Italy to\r\ntake possession of that kingdom. But before Charles came to Rome the\r\npope died, and was succeeded by Clement IV., in whose time he arrived\r\nat Ostia, with thirty galleys, and ordered that the rest of his forces\r\nshould come by land. During his abode at Rome, the citizens, in order\r\nto attach him to them, made him their senator, and the pope invested him\r\nwith the kingdom, on condition that he should pay annually to the\r\nchurch the sum of fifty thousand ducats; and it was decreed that, from\r\nthenceforth, neither Charles nor any other person, who might be king of\r\nNaples, should be emperor also. Charles marched against Manfred, routed\r\nhis army, and slew him near Benevento, and then became sovereign of\r\nSicily and Naples. Corradino, to whom, by his father's will, the state\r\nbelonged, having collected a great force in Germany, marched into Italy\r\nagainst Charles, with whom he came to an engagement at Tagliacozzo, was\r\ntaken prisoner while endeavoring to escape, and being unknown, put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nItaly remained in repose until the pontificate of Adrian V. Charles,\r\nbeing at Rome and governing the city by virtue of his office of senator,\r\nthe pope, unable to endure his power, withdrew to Viterbo, and solicited\r\nthe Emperor Rodolph to come into Italy and assist him. Thus the popes,\r\nsometimes in zeal for religion, at others moved by their own ambition,\r\nwere continually calling in new parties and exciting new disturbances.\r\nAs soon as they had made a prince powerful, they viewed him with\r\njealousy and sought his ruin; and never allowed another to rule the\r\ncountry, which, from their own imbecility, they were themselves unable\r\nto govern. Princes were in fear of them; for, fighting or running away,\r\nthe popes always obtained the advantage, unless it happened they were\r\nentrapped by deceit, as occurred to Boniface VIII., and some others, who\r\nunder pretense of friendship, were ensnared by the emperors. Rodolph did\r\nnot come into Italy, being detained by the war in which he was engaged\r\nwith the king of Bohemia. At this time Adrian died, and Nicholas III.,\r\nof the Orsini family, became pontiff. He was a bold, ambitious man; and\r\nbeing resolved at any event to diminish the power of Charles, induced\r\nthe Emperor Rodolph to complain that he had a governor in Tuscany\r\nfavorable to the Guelphic faction, who after the death of Manfred had\r\nbeen replaced by him. Charles yielded to the emperor and withdrew his\r\ngovernor, and the pope sent one of his nephews, a cardinal, as governor\r\nfor the emperor, who, for the honor done him, restored Romagna to the\r\nchurch, which had been taken from her by his predecessors, and the pope\r\nmade Bertoldo Orsino duke of Romagna. As Nicholas now thought himself\r\npowerful enough to oppose Charles, he deprived him of the office of\r\nsenator, and made a decree that no one of royal race should ever be a\r\nsenator in Rome. It was his intention to deprive Charles of Sicily, and\r\nto this end he entered into a secret negotiation with Peter, king of\r\nAragon, which took effect in the following papacy. He also had the\r\ndesign of creating two kings out of his family, the one in Lombardy, the\r\nother in Tuscany, whose power would defend the church from the Germans\r\nwho might design to come into Italy, and from the French, who were in\r\nthe kingdom of Naples and Sicily. But with these thoughts he died. He\r\nwas the first pope who openly exhibited his own ambition; and, under\r\npretense of making the church great, conferred honors and emolument upon\r\nhis own family. Previous to his time no mention is made of the nephews\r\nor families of any pontiff, but future history is full of them; nor is\r\nthere now anything left for them to attempt, except the effort to make\r\nthe papacy hereditary. True it is, the princes of their creating have\r\nnot long sustained their honors; for the pontiffs, being generally of\r\nvery limited existence, did not get their plants properly established.\r\n\r\nTo Nicholas succeeded Martin IV., of French origin, and consequently\r\nfavorable to the party of Charles, who sent him assistance against\r\nthe rebellion of Romagna; and while they were encamped at Furli, Guido\r\nBonatto, an astrologer, contrived that at an appointed moment the people\r\nshould assail the forces of the king, and the plan succeeding, all the\r\nFrench were taken and slain. About this period was also carried into\r\neffect the plot of Pope Nicholas and Peter, king of Aragon, by which the\r\nSicilians murdered all the French that were in that island; and Peter\r\nmade himself sovereign of it, saying, that it belonged to him in the\r\nright of his wife Gostanza, daughter of Manfred. But Charles, while\r\nmaking warlike preparations for the recovery of Sicily, died, leaving\r\na son, Charles II., who was made prisoner in Sicily, and to recover his\r\nliberty promised to return to his prison, if within three years he\r\ndid not obtain the pope's consent that the kings of Aragon should be\r\ninvested with the kingdom of Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Rodolph, instead of coming into Italy, gave the empire the\r\nadvantage of having done so, by sending an ambassador, with authority\r\nto make all those cities free which would redeem themselves with money.\r\nMany purchased their freedom, and with liberty changed their mode of\r\nliving. Adolpho of Saxony succeeded to the empire; and to the papacy,\r\nPietro del Murrone, who took the name of Celestino; but, being a hermit\r\nand full of sanctity, after six months renounced the pontificate, and\r\nBoniface VIII. was elected.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the French and Germans left Italy, and the country remained\r\nwholly in the hands of the Italians; but Providence ordained that the\r\npope, when these enemies were withdrawn, should neither establish nor\r\nenjoy his authority, and raised two very powerful families in Rome,\r\nthe Colonnesi and the Orsini, who with their arms, and the proximity\r\nof their abode, kept the pontificate weak. Boniface then determined\r\nto destroy the Colonnesi, and, besides excommunicating, endeavored to\r\ndirect the weapons of the church against them. This, although it did\r\nthem some injury, proved more disastrous to the pope; for those arms\r\nwhich from attachment to the faith performed valiantly against its\r\nenemies, as soon as they were directed against Christians for private\r\nambition, ceased to do the will of those who wished to wield them. And\r\nthus the too eager desire to gratify themselves, caused the pontiffs by\r\ndegrees to lose their military power. Besides what is just related, the\r\npope deprived two cardinals of the Colonnesi family of their office; and\r\nSciarra, the head of the house, escaping unknown, was taken by corsairs\r\nof Catalonia and put to the oar; but being afterward recognized\r\nat Marseilles, he was sent to Philip, king of France, who had been\r\nexcommunicated and deprived of the kingdom. Philip, considering that\r\nin a war against the pontiff he would either be a loser or run great\r\nhazards, had recourse to deception, and simulating a wish to come to\r\nterms, secretly sent Sciarra into Italy, who, having arrived at Anagnia,\r\nwhere his holiness then resided, assembled a few friends, and in the\r\nnight took him prisoner. And although the people of Anagnia set him\r\nat liberty shortly after, yet from grief at the injury he died mad.\r\nBoniface was founder of the jubilee in 1300, and fixed that it should\r\nbe celebrated at each revolution of one hundred years. In those times\r\nvarious troubles arose between the Guelph and Ghibelline factions; and\r\nthe emperors having abandoned Italy, many places became free, and many\r\nwere occupied by tyrants. Pope Benedict restored the scarlet hat to the\r\ncardinals of the Colonnesi family, and reblessed Philip, king of France.\r\nHe was succeeded by Clement V., who, being a Frenchman, removed the\r\npapal court to Avignon in 1305.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Henry comes into Italy--The Florentines take the part of\r\nthe pope--The Visconti originate the duchy of Milan--Artifice of Maffeo\r\nVisconti against the family of de la Torre--Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti,\r\nfirst duke of Milan--The Emperor Louis in Italy--John, king of\r\nBohemia, in Italy--League against the king of Bohemia and the pope's\r\nlegate--Origin of Venice--Liberty of the Venetians confirmed by Pepin\r\nand the Greek emperor--Greatness of Venice--Decline of Venice--Discord\r\nbetween the pope and the emperor--Giovanna, queen of Naples--Rienzi--The\r\njubilee reduced to fifty years--Succession of the duke of\r\nMilan--Cardinal Egidio the pope's legate--War between the Genoese and\r\nthe Venetians.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Charles II. of Naples died, and was succeeded by his son\r\nRobert. Henry of Luxemburg had been elected to the empire, and came to\r\nRome for his coronation, although the pope was not there. His coming\r\noccasioned great excitement in Lombardy; for he sent all the banished\r\nto their homes, whether they were Guelphs or Ghibellines; and in\r\nconsequence of this, one faction endeavoring to drive out the other, the\r\nwhole province was filled with war; nor could the emperor with all his\r\nendeavors abate its fury. Leaving Lombardy by way of Genoa, he came\r\nto Pisa, where he endeavored to take Tuscany from King Robert; but not\r\nbeing successful, he went to Rome, where he remained only a few days,\r\nbeing driven away by the Orsini with the consent of King Robert, and\r\nreturned to Pisa; and that he might more securely make war upon Tuscany,\r\nand wrest the country from the hands of the king, he caused it to be\r\nassailed by Frederick, monarch of Sicily. But when he was in hope of\r\noccupying Tuscany and robbing the king of Naples of his dominions, he\r\ndied, and was succeeded by Louis of Bavaria. About the same period, John\r\nXXII. attained the papacy, during whose time the emperor still continued\r\nto persecute the Guelphs and the church, but they were defended by\r\nRobert and the Florentines. Many wars took place in Lombardy between the\r\nVisconti and the Guelphs, and in Tuscany between Castruccio of Lucca\r\nand the Florentines. As the family of Visconti gave rise to the duchy of\r\nMilan, one of the five principalities which afterward governed Italy, I\r\nshall speak of them from a rather earlier date.\r\n\r\nMilan, upon recovering from the ruin into which she had been thrown by\r\nFrederick Barbarossa, in revenge for her injuries, joined the league\r\nformed by the Lombard cities for their common defense; this restrained\r\nhim, and for awhile preserved alive the interests of the church in\r\nLombardy. In the course of the wars which followed, the family of La\r\nTorre became very potent in that city, and their reputation increased\r\nso long as the emperor possessed little authority in the province.\r\nBut Frederick II. coming into Italy, and the Ghibelline party, by the\r\ninfluence of Ezelin having grown powerful, seeds of the same faction\r\nsprang up in all the cities. In Milan were the Visconti, who expelled\r\nthe La Torres; these, however, did not remain out, for by agreement\r\nbetween the emperor and the pope they were restored to their country.\r\nFor when the pope and his court removed to France, and the emperor,\r\nHenry of Luxemburg, came into Italy, with the pretext of going to Rome\r\nfor his crown, he was received in Milan by Maffeo Visconti and Guido\r\ndella Torre, who were then the heads of these families. But Maffeo,\r\ndesigning to make use of the emperor for the purpose of expelling Guido,\r\nand thinking the enterprise not difficult, on account of the La Torre\r\nbeing of the contrary faction to the imperial, took occasion, from the\r\nremarks which the people made of the uncivil behavior of the Germans,\r\nto go craftily about and excite the populace to arm themselves and throw\r\noff the yoke of these barbarians. When a suitable moment arrived, he\r\ncaused a person in whom he confided to create a tumult, upon which the\r\npeople took arms against the Germans. But no sooner was the mischief\r\nwell on foot, than Maffeo, with his sons and their partisans, ran to\r\nHenry, telling him that all the disturbance had been occasioned by the\r\nLa Torre family, who, not content to remain peaceably in Milan, had\r\ntaken the opportunity to plunder him, that they might ingratiate\r\nthemselves with the Guelphs of Italy and become princes in the city;\r\nthey then bade him be of good cheer, for they, with their party,\r\nwhenever he wished it, were ready to defend him with their lives. Henry,\r\nbelieving all that Maffeo told him, joined his forces to those of the\r\nVisconti, and attacking the La Torre, who were in various parts of the\r\ncity endeavoring to quell the tumult, slew all upon whom they could lay\r\nhands, and having plundered the others of their property, sent them into\r\nexile. By this artifice, Maffeo Visconti became a prince of Milan. Of\r\nhim remained Galeazzo and Azzo; and, after these, Luchino and Giovanni.\r\nGiovanni became archbishop of Milan; and of Luchino, who died before\r\nhim, were left Bernabo and Galeazzo; Galeazzo, dying soon after, left\r\na son called the Count of Virtu, who after the death of the archbishop,\r\ncontrived the murder of his uncle, Bernabo, became prince of Milan,\r\nand was the first who had the title of duke. The duke left Filippo and\r\nGiovanmaria Angelo, the latter of whom being slain by the people of\r\nMilan, the state fell to Filippo; but he having no male heir, Milan\r\npassed from the family of Visconti to that of Sforza, in the manner to\r\nbe related hereafter.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the point from which we deviated. The Emperor Louis, to\r\nadd to the importance of his party and to receive the crown, came\r\ninto Italy; and being at Milan, as an excuse for taking money of the\r\nMilanese, he pretended to make them free and to put the Visconti in\r\nprison; but shortly afterwards he released them, and, having gone to\r\nRome, in order to disturb Italy with less difficulty, he made Piero\r\ndella Corvara anti-pope, by whose influence, and the power of the\r\nVisconti, he designed to weaken the opposite faction in Tuscany and\r\nLombardy. But Castruccio died, and his death caused the failure of the\r\nemperor's purpose; for Pisa and Lucca rebelled. The Pisans sent Piero\r\ndella Corvara a prisoner to the pope in France, and the emperor,\r\ndespairing of the affairs of Italy, returned to Germany. He had scarcely\r\nleft, before John king of Bohemia came into the country, at the request\r\nof the Ghibellines of Brescia, and made himself lord of that city and of\r\nBergamo. And as his entry was with the consent of the pope, although\r\nhe feigned the contrary, the legate of Bologna favored him, thinking by\r\nthis means to prevent the return of the emperor. This caused a change in\r\nthe parties of Italy; for the Florentines and King Robert, finding the\r\nlegate was favorable to the enterprises of the Ghibellines, became foes\r\nof all those to whom the legate and the king of Bohemia were friendly.\r\nWithout having regard for either faction, whether Guelph or Ghibelline,\r\nmany princes joined them, of whom, among others, were the Visconti, the\r\nDella Scala, Filippo Gonzao of Mantua, the Carrara, and those of Este.\r\nUpon this the pope excommunicated them all. The king, in fear of the\r\nleague, went to collect forces in his own country, and having returned\r\nwith a large army, still found his undertaking a difficult one; so,\r\nseeing his error, he withdrew to Bohemia, to the great displeasure of\r\nthe legate, leaving only Reggio and Modena guarded, and Parma in the\r\ncare of Marsilio and Piero de' Rossi, who were the most powerful men in\r\nthe city. The king of Bohemia being gone, Bologna joined the league; and\r\nthe leaguers divided among themselves the four cities which remained of\r\nthe church faction. They agreed that Parma should pertain to the Della\r\nScalla; Reggio to the Gonzaga; Modena to the family of Este, and Lucca\r\nto the Florentines. But in taking possession of these cities, many\r\ndisputes arose which were afterward in a great measure settled by the\r\nVenetians. Some, perhaps, will think it a species of impropriety that\r\nwe have so long deferred speaking of the Venetians, theirs being a\r\nrepublic, which, both on account of its power and internal regulations,\r\ndeserves to be celebrated above any principality of Italy. But that this\r\nsurprise may cease when the cause is known, I shall speak of their city\r\nfrom a more remote period; that everyone may understand what were their\r\nbeginnings, and the causes which so long withheld them from interfering\r\nin the affairs of Italy.\r\n\r\nWhen Attila, king of the Huns, besieged Aquileia, the inhabitants, after\r\ndefending themselves a long time, began to despair of effecting their\r\nsafety, and fled for refuge to several uninhabited rocks, situated at\r\nthe point of the Adriatic Sea, now called the Gulf of Venice, carrying\r\nwith them whatever movable property they possessed. The people of Padua,\r\nfinding themselves in equal danger, and knowing that, having became\r\nmaster of Aquileia, Attila would next attack themselves, also removed\r\nwith their most valuable property to a place on the same sea, called\r\nRivo Alto, to which they brought their women, children, and aged\r\npersons, leaving the youth in Padua to assist in her defense. Besides\r\nthese, the people of Monselice, with the inhabitants of the surrounding\r\nhills, driven by similar fears, fled to the same rocks. But after Attila\r\nhad taken Aquileia, and destroyed Padua, Monselice, Vicenza, and Verona,\r\nthe people of Padua and others who were powerful, continued to inhabit\r\nthe marshes about Rivo Alto; and, in like manner, all the people of the\r\nprovince anciently called Venetia, driven by the same events, became\r\ncollected in these marshes. Thus, under the pressure of necessity,\r\nthey left an agreeable and fertile country to occupy one sterile and\r\nunwholesome. However, in consequence of a great number of people being\r\ndrawn together into a comparatively small space, in a short time\r\nthey made those places not only habitable, but delightful; and having\r\nestablished among themselves laws and useful regulations, enjoyed\r\nthemselves in security amid the devastations of Italy, and soon\r\nincreased both in reputation and strength. For, besides the inhabitants\r\nalready mentioned, many fled to these places from the cities of\r\nLombardy, principally to escape from the cruelties of Clefis king of the\r\nLombards, which greatly tended to increase the numbers of the new city;\r\nand in the conventions which were made between Pepin, king of France,\r\nand the emperor of Greece, when the former, at the entreaty of the pope,\r\ncame to drive the Lombards out of Italy, the duke of Benevento and the\r\nVenetians did not render obedience to either the one or the other,\r\nbut alone enjoyed their liberty. As necessity had led them to dwell\r\non sterile rocks, they were compelled to seek the means of subsistence\r\nelsewhere; and voyaging with their ships to every port of the ocean,\r\ntheir city became a depository for the various products of the world,\r\nand was itself filled with men of every nation.\r\n\r\nFor many years the Venetians sought no other dominion than that which\r\ntended to facilitate their commercial enterprises, and thus acquired\r\nmany ports in Greece and Syria; and as the French had made frequent use\r\nof their ships in voyages to Asia, the island of Candia was assigned to\r\nthem in recompense for these services. While they lived in this manner,\r\ntheir name spread terror over the seas, and was held in veneration\r\nthroughout Italy. This was so completely the case, that they were\r\ngenerally chosen to arbitrate in controversies between the states, as\r\noccurred in the difference between the Colleagues, on account of the\r\ncities they had divided among themselves; which being referred to the\r\nVenetians, they awarded Brescia and Bergamo to the Visconti. But when,\r\nin the course of time, urged by their eagerness for dominion, they had\r\nmade themselves masters of Padua, Vicenza, Trevisa, and afterward\r\nof Verona, Bergamo, and Brescia, with many cities in Romagna and the\r\nkingdom of Naples, other nations were impressed with such an opinion of\r\ntheir power, that they were a terror, not only to the princes of Italy,\r\nbut to the ultramontane kings. These states entered into an alliance\r\nagainst them, and in one day wrested from them the provinces they had\r\nobtained with so much labor and expense; and although they have in\r\nlatter times reacquired some portions, still possessing neither power\r\nnor reputation, like all the other Italian powers, they live at the\r\nmercy of others.\r\n\r\nBenedict XII. having attained the pontificate and finding Italy lost,\r\nfearing, too, that the emperor would assume the sovereignty of\r\nthe country, determined to make friends of all who had usurped the\r\ngovernment of those cities which had been accustomed to obey the\r\nemperor; that they might have occasion to dread the latter, and unite\r\nwith himself in the defense of Italy. To this end he issued a decree,\r\nconfirming to all the tyrants of Lombardy the places they had seized.\r\nAfter making this concession the pope died, and was succeeded by\r\nClement VI. The emperor, seeing with what a liberal hand the pontiff had\r\nbestowed the dominions of the empire, in order to be equally bountiful\r\nwith the property of others, gave to all who had assumed sovereignty\r\nover the cities or territories of the church, the imperial authority\r\nto retain possession of them. By this means Galeotto Malatesti and\r\nhis brothers became lords of Rimino, Pesaro, and Fano; Antonio da\r\nMontefeltro, of the Marca and Urbino; Gentile da Varano, of Camerino;\r\nGuido di Polenta, of Ravenna; Sinibaldo Ordelaffi, of Furli and Cesena;\r\nGiovanni Manfredi, of Faenza; Lodovico Alidossi, of Imola; and besides\r\nthese, many others in divers places. Thus, of all the cities, towns, or\r\nfortresses of the church, few remained without a prince; for she did not\r\nrecover herself till the time of Alexander VI., who, by the ruin of the\r\ndescendants of these princes, restored the authority of the church.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, when he made the concession before named, being at Tarento,\r\nsignified an intention of going into Italy. In consequence of this, many\r\nbattles were fought in Lombardy, and the Visconti became lords of Parma.\r\nRobert king of Naples, now died, leaving only two grandchildren, the\r\nissue of his sons Charles, who had died a considerable time before him.\r\nHe ordered that the elder of the two, whose name was Giovanna or Joan,\r\nshould be heiress of the kingdom, and take for her husband Andrea, son\r\nof the king of Hungary, his grandson. Andrea had not lived with her\r\nlong, before she caused him to be murdered, and married another cousin,\r\nLouis, prince of Tarento. But Louis, king of Hungary, and brother of\r\nAndrea, in order to avenge his death, brought forces into Italy, and\r\ndrove Queen Joan and her husband out of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nAt this period a memorable circumstance took place at Rome. Niccolo di\r\nLorenzo, often called Rienzi or Cola di Rienzi, who held the office of\r\nchancellor at Campidoglio, drove the senators from Rome and, under the\r\ntitle of tribune, made himself the head of the Roman republic; restoring\r\nit to its ancient form, and with so great reputation of justice and\r\nvirtue, that not only the places adjacent, but the whole of Italy sent\r\nambassadors to him. The ancient provinces, seeing Rome arise to new\r\nlife, again raised their heads, and some induced by hope, others by\r\nfear, honored him as their sovereign. But Niccolo, notwithstanding\r\nhis great reputation, lost all energy in the very beginning of\r\nhis enterprise; and as if oppressed with the weight of so vast an\r\nundertaking, without being driven away, secretly fled to Charles, king\r\nof Bohemia, who, by the influence of the pope, and in contempt of Louis\r\nof Bavaria, had been elected emperor. Charles, to ingratiate himself\r\nwith the pontiff, sent Niccolo to him, a prisoner. After some time, in\r\nimitation of Rienzi, Francesco Baroncegli seized upon the tribunate of\r\nRome, and expelled the senators; and the pope, as the most effectual\r\nmeans of repressing him, drew Niccolo from his prison, sent him to Rome,\r\nand restored to him the office of tribune; so that he reoccupied\r\nthe state and put Francesco to death; but the Colonnesi becoming his\r\nenemies, he too, after a short time, shared the same fate, and the\r\nsenators were again restored to their office. The king of Hungary,\r\nhaving driven out Queen Joan, returned to his kingdom; but the pope,\r\nwho chose to have the queen in the neighborhood of Rome rather than the\r\nking, effected her restoration to the sovereignty, on the condition that\r\nher husband, contenting himself with the title of prince of Tarento,\r\nshould not be called king. Being the year 1350, the pope thought that\r\nthe jubilee, appointed by Boniface VIII. to take place at the conclusion\r\nof each century, might be renewed at the end of each fifty years; and\r\nhaving issued a decree for the establishment of it, the Romans, in\r\nacknowledgment of the benefit, consented that he should send four\r\ncardinals to reform the government of the city, and appoint senators\r\naccording to his own pleasure. The pope again declared Louis of Tarento,\r\nking, and in gratitude for the benefit, Queen Joan gave Avignon, her\r\ninheritance, to the church. About this time Luchino Visconti died, and\r\nhis brother the archbishop, remaining lord of Milan, carried on many\r\nwars against Tuscany and his neighbors, and became very powerful.\r\nBernabo and Galeazzo, his nephews, succeeded him; but Galeazzo soon\r\nafter died, leaving Giovan Galeazzo, who shared the state with Bernabo.\r\nCharles, king of Bohemia, was then emperor, and the pontificate was\r\noccupied by Innocent VI., who sent Cardinal Egidio, a Spaniard, into\r\nItaly. He restored the reputation of the church, not only in Rome and\r\nRomagna, but throughout the whole of Italy; he recovered Bologna from\r\nthe archbishop of Milan, and compelled the Romans to accept a foreign\r\nsenator appointed annually by the pope. He made honorable terms with the\r\nVisconti, and routed and took prisoner, John Agut, an Englishman, who\r\nwith four thousand English had fought on the side of the Ghibellines in\r\nTuscany. Urban V., hearing of so many victories, resolved to visit Italy\r\nand Rome, whither also the emperor came; after remaining a few months,\r\nhe returned to the kingdom of Bohemia, and the pope to Avignon. On\r\nthe death of Urban, Gregory XI. was created pope; and, as the Cardinal\r\nEgidio was dead, Italy again recommenced her ancient discords,\r\noccasioned by the union of the other powers against the Visconti; and\r\nthe pope, having first sent a legate with six thousand Bretons, came in\r\nperson and established the papal court at Rome in 1376, after an absence\r\nof seventy-one years in France. To Gregory XI., succeeded Urban VI., but\r\nshortly afterwards Clement VI. was elected at Fondi by ten cardinals,\r\nwho declared the appointment of Urban irregular. At this time, the\r\nGenoese threw off the yoke of the Visconti under whom they had lived\r\nmany years; and between them and the Venetians several important battles\r\nwere fought for the island of Tenedos. Although the Genoese were for a\r\ntime successful, and held Venice in a state of siege during many months,\r\nthe Venetians were at length victorious; and by the intervention of\r\nthe pope, peace was made in the year 1381. In these wars, artillery was\r\nfirst used, having been recently invented by the Dutch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSchism in the church--Ambitious views of Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti--The\r\npope and the Romans come to an agreement--Boniface IX. introduces the\r\npractice of Annates--Disturbance in Lombardy--The Venetians acquire\r\ndominion on terra firma--Differences between the pope and the people of\r\nRome--Council of Pisa--Council of Constance--Filippo Visconti recovers\r\nhis dominion--Giovanna II. of Naples--Political condition of Italy.\r\n\r\nA schism having thus arisen in the church, Queen Joan favored the\r\nschismatic pope, upon which Urban caused Charles of Durazzo, descended\r\nfrom the kings of Naples, to undertake the conquest of her dominions.\r\nHaving succeeded in his object, she fled to France, and he assumed the\r\nsovereignty. The king of France, being exasperated, sent Louis of Anjou\r\ninto Italy to recover the kingdom for the queen, to expel Urban from\r\nRome, and establish the anti-pope. But in the midst of this enterprise\r\nLouis died, and his people being routed returned to France. In this\r\nconjuncture the pope went to Naples, where he put nine cardinals into\r\nprison for having taken the part of France and the anti-pope. He then\r\nbecame offended with the king, for having refused to make his nephew\r\nprince of Capua; and pretending not to care about it, requested he\r\nwould grant him Nocera for his habitation, but, having fortified it,\r\nhe prepared to deprive the king of his dominions. Upon this the king\r\npitched his camp before the place, and the pope fled to Naples, where\r\nhe put to death the cardinals whom he had imprisoned. From thence\r\nhe proceeded to Rome, and, to acquire influence, created twenty-nine\r\ncardinals. At this time Charles, king of Naples, went to Hungary,\r\nwhere, having been made king, he was shortly afterward killed in battle,\r\nleaving a wife and two children at Naples. About the same time Giovanni\r\nGaleazzo Visconti murdered Bernabo his uncle and took the entire\r\nsovereignty upon himself; and, not content with being duke of Milan and\r\nsovereign of the whole of Lombardy, designed to make himself master of\r\nTuscany; but while he was intent upon occupying the province with the\r\nultimate view of making himself king of Italy, he died. Boniface IX.\r\nsucceeded Urban VI. The anti-pope, Clement VI., also died, and Benedict\r\nXIII. was appointed his successor.\r\n\r\nMany English, Germans, and Bretons served at this period in the armies\r\nof Italy, commanded partly by those leaders who had from time to time\r\nauthority in the country, and partly by such as the pontiffs sent, when\r\nthey were at Avignon. With these warriors the princes of Italy long\r\ncarried on their wars, till the coming of Lodovico da Cento of Romagna,\r\nwho formed a body of Italian soldiery, called the Company of St. George,\r\nwhose valor and discipline soon caused the foreign troops to fall into\r\ndisrepute, and gave reputation to the native forces of the country, of\r\nwhich the princes afterward availed themselves in their wars with each\r\nother. The pope, Boniface IX., being at enmity with the Romans, went to\r\nScesi, where he remained till the jubilee of 1400, when the Romans, to\r\ninduce him to return to the city, consented to receive another foreign\r\nsenator of his appointing, and also allowed him to fortify the castle of\r\nSaint Angelo: having returned upon these conditions, in order to enrich\r\nthe church, he ordained that everyone, upon vacating a benefice, should\r\npay a year's value of it to the Apostolic Chamber.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Giovanni Galeazzo, duke of Milan, although he left\r\ntwo children, Giovanmaria and Filippo, the state was divided into many\r\nparts, and in the troubles which ensued Giovanmaria was slain. Filippo\r\nremained some time in the castle of Pavia, from which, through the\r\nfidelity and virtue of the castellan, he escaped. Among others who\r\noccupied cities possessed by his father, was Guglielmo della Scala, who,\r\nbeing banished, fell into the hands of Francesco de Carrera, lord of\r\nPadua, by whose means he recovered the state of Verona, in which he only\r\nremained a short time, for he was poisoned, by order of Francesco, and\r\nthe city taken from him. These things occasioned the people of Vicenza,\r\nwho had lived in security under the protection of the Visconti, to dread\r\nthe greatness of the lord of Padua, and they placed themselves under the\r\nVenetians, who, engaging in arms with him, first took Verona and then\r\nPadua.\r\n\r\nAt this time Pope Boniface died, and was succeeded by Innocent VII. The\r\npeople of Rome supplicated him to restore to them their fortresses\r\nand their liberty; but as he would not consent to their petition,\r\nthey called to their assistance Ladislaus, king of Naples. Becoming\r\nreconciled to the people, the pope returned to Rome, and made his nephew\r\nLodovico count of La Marca. Innocent soon after died, and Gregory XII.\r\nwas created, upon the understanding to renounce the papacy whenever the\r\nanti-pope would also renounce it. By the advice of the cardinals, in\r\norder to attempt the reunion of the church, Benedict, the anti-pope,\r\ncame to Porto Venere, and Gregory to Lucca, where they made many\r\nendeavors, but effected nothing. Upon this, the cardinals of both the\r\npopes abandoned them, Benedict going to Spain, and Gregory to Rimini.\r\nOn the other hand, the cardinals, with the favor of Balthazar Cossa,\r\ncardinal and legate of Bologna, appointed a council at Pisa, where they\r\ncreated Alexander V., who immediately excommunicated King Ladislaus,\r\nand invested Louis of Anjou with the kingdom; this prince, with the\r\nFlorentines, Genoese, and Venetians, attacked Ladislaus and drove him\r\nfrom Rome. In the head of the war Alexander died, and Balthazar Cossa\r\nsucceeded him, with the title of John XXIII. Leaving Bologna, where he\r\nwas elected, he went to Rome, and found there Louis of Anjou, who\r\nhad brought the army from Provence, and coming to an engagement with\r\nLadislaus, routed him. But by the mismanagement of the leaders, they\r\nwere unable to prosecute the victory, so that the king in a short time\r\ngathered strength and retook Rome. Louis fled to Provence, the pope\r\nto Bologna; where, considering how he might diminish the power of\r\nLadislaus, he caused Sigismund, king of Hungary, to be elected emperor,\r\nand advised him to come to Italy. Having a personal interview at Mantua,\r\nthey agreed to call a general council, in which the church should be\r\nunited; and having effected this, the pope thought he should be fully\r\nenabled to oppose the forces of his enemies.\r\n\r\nAt this time there were three popes, Gregory, Benedict, and Giovanni,\r\nwhich kept the church weak and in disrepute. The city of Constance, in\r\nGermany, was appointed for the holding of the council, contrary to\r\nthe expectation of Pope John. And although the death of Ladislaus had\r\nremoved the cause which induced the pope to call the council, still,\r\nhaving promised to attend, he could not refuse to go there. In a few\r\nmonths after his arrival at Constance he discovered his error, but it\r\nwas too late; endeavoring to escape, he was taken, put into prison, and\r\ncompelled to renounce the papacy. Gregory, one of the anti-popes, sent\r\nhis renunciation; Benedict, the other, refusing to do the same, was\r\ncondemned as a heretic; but, being abandoned by his cardinals, he\r\ncomplied, and the council elected Oddo, of the Colonnesi family, pope,\r\nby the title of Martin V. Thus the church was united under one head,\r\nafter having been divided by many pontiffs.\r\n\r\nFilippo Visconti was, as we have said, in the fortress of Pavia. But\r\nFazino Cane, who in the affairs of Lombardy had become lord of Vercelli,\r\nAlessandria, Novara, and Tortona, and had amassed great riches, finding\r\nhis end approach, and having no children, left his wife Beatrice heiress\r\nof his estates, and arranged with his friends that a marriage should be\r\neffected between her and Filippo. By this union Filippo became powerful,\r\nand reacquired Milan and the whole of Lombardy. By way of being grateful\r\nfor these numerous favors, as princes commonly are, he accused Beatrice\r\nof adultery and caused her to be put to death. Finding himself now\r\npossessed of greater power, he began to think of warring with Tuscany\r\nand of prosecuting the designs of Giovanni Galeazzo, his father.\r\n\r\nLadislaus, king of Naples, at his death, left to his sister Giovanna the\r\nkingdom and a large army, under the command of the principal leaders of\r\nItaly, among the first of whom was Sforza of Cotignuola, reputed by the\r\nsoldiery of that period to be a very valiant man. The queen, to shun the\r\ndisgrace of having kept about her person a certain Pandolfello, whom she\r\nhad brought up, took for her husband Giacopo della Marca, a Frenchman of\r\nthe royal line, on the condition that he should be content to be called\r\nPrince of Tarento, and leave to her the title and government of the\r\nkingdom. But the soldiery, upon his arrival in Naples, proclaimed him\r\nking; so that between the husband and the wife wars ensued; and although\r\nthey contended with varying success, the queen at length obtained the\r\nsuperiority, and became an enemy of the pope. Upon this, in order\r\nto reduce her to necessity, and that she might be compelled to throw\r\nherself into his lap, Sforza suddenly withdrew from her service without\r\ngiving her any pervious notice of his intention to do so. She thus found\r\nherself at once unarmed, and not having any other source, sought the\r\nassistance of Alfonzo, king of Aragon and Sicily, adopted him as her\r\nson, and engaged Braccio of Montone as her captain, who was of equal\r\nreputation in arms with Sforza, and inimical to the pope, on account of\r\nhis having taken possession of Perugia and some other places belonging\r\nto the church. After this, peace was made between the queen and the\r\npontiff; but King Alfonzo, expecting she would treat him as she had her\r\nhusband, endeavored secretly to make himself master of the strongholds;\r\nbut, possessing acute observation, she was beforehand with him, and\r\nfortified herself in the castle of Naples. Suspicions increasing between\r\nthem, they had recourse to arms, and the queen, with the assistance\r\nof Sforza, who again resumed her service, drove Alfonzo out of Naples,\r\ndeprived him of his succession, and adopted Louis of Anjou in his stead.\r\nHence arose new contests between Braccio, who took the part of Alfonzo,\r\nand Sforza, who defended the cause of the queen. In the course of the\r\nwar, Sforza was drowned in endeavoring to pass the river Pescara; the\r\nqueen was thus again unarmed, and would have been driven out of the\r\nkingdom, but for the assistance of Filippo Visconti, the duke of Milan,\r\nwho compelled Alfonzo to return to Aragon. Braccio, undaunted at the\r\ndeparture of Alfonzo, continued the enterprise against the queen, and\r\nbesieged L'Aquilla; but the pope, thinking the greatness of Braccio\r\ninjurious to the church, received into his pay Francesco, the son of\r\nSforza, who went in pursuit of Braccio to L'Aquilla, where he routed\r\nand slew him. Of Braccio remained Oddo, his son, from whom the pope took\r\nPerugia, and left him the state of Montone alone; but he was shortly\r\nafterward slain in Romagna, in the service of the Florentines; so that\r\nof those who had fought under Braccio, Niccolo Piccinino remained of\r\ngreatest reputation.\r\n\r\nHaving continued our general narration nearly to the period which we at\r\nfirst proposed to reach, what remains is of little importance, except\r\nthe war which the Florentines and Venetians carried on against\r\nFilippo duke of Milan, of which an account will be given when we speak\r\nparticularly of Florence. I shall, therefore, continue it no further,\r\nbriefly explaining the condition of Italy in respect of her princes and\r\nher arms, at the period to which we have now come. Joan II. held Naples,\r\nLa Marca, the Patrimony and Romagna; some of these places obeyed the\r\nchurch, while others were held by vicars or tyrants, as Ferrara, Modena,\r\nand Reggio, by those of the House of Este; Faenza by the Manfredi;\r\nImola by the Alidossi; Furli by the Ordelaffi; Rimini and Psaro by the\r\nMalatesti; and Camerino by those of Varano. Part of Lombardy was subject\r\nto the Duke Filippo, part to the Venetians; for all those who had held\r\nsingle states were set aside, except the House of Gonzaga, which ruled\r\nin Mantua. The greater part of Tuscany was subject to the Florentines.\r\nLucca and Sienna alone were governed by their own laws; Lucca was under\r\nthe Guinigi; Sienna was free. The Genoese, being sometimes free,\r\nat others, subject to the kings of France or the Visconti, lived\r\nunrespected, and may be enumerated among the minor powers.\r\n\r\nNone of the principal states were armed with their own proper forces.\r\nDuke Filippo kept himself shut up in his apartments, and would not\r\nallow himself to be seen; his wars were managed by commissaries. The\r\nVenetians, when they directed their attention to terra firma, threw off\r\nthose arms which had made them terrible upon the seas, and falling into\r\nthe customs of Italy, submitted their forces to the direction of others.\r\nThe practice of arms being unsuitable to priests or women, the pope and\r\nQueen Joan of Naples were compelled by necessity to submit to the same\r\nsystem which others practiced from defect of judgment. The Florentines\r\nalso adopted the same custom, for having, by their frequent divisions,\r\ndestroyed the nobility, and their republic being wholly in the hands of\r\nmen brought up to trade, they followed the usages and example of others.\r\n\r\nThus the arms of Italy were either in the hands of the lesser princes,\r\nor of men who possessed no state; for the minor princes did not adopt\r\nthe practice of arms from any desire of glory, but for the acquisition\r\nof either property or safety. The others (those who possessed no state)\r\nbeing bred to arms from their infancy, were acquainted with no other\r\nart, and pursued war for emolument, or to confer honor upon themselves.\r\nThe most noticed among the latter were Carmignola, Francesco Sforza,\r\nNiccolo Piccinino the pupil of Braccio, Agnolo della Pergola, Lorenzo\r\ndi Micheletto Attenduli, il Tartaglia, Giacopaccio, Cecolini da Perugia,\r\nNiccolo da Tolentino, Guido Torello, Antonia dal Ponte ad Era, and many\r\nothers. With these, were those lords of whom I have before spoken, to\r\nwhich may be added the barons of Rome, the Colonnesi and the Orsini,\r\nwith other lords and gentlemen of the kingdoms of Naples and Lombardy,\r\nwho, being constantly in arms, had such an understanding among\r\nthemselves, and so contrived to accommodate things to their own\r\nconvenience, that of those who were at war, most commonly both\r\nsides were losers; and they had made the practice of arms so totally\r\nridiculous, that the most ordinary leader, possessed of true valor,\r\nwould have covered these men with disgrace, whom, with so little\r\nprudence, Italy honored.\r\n\r\nWith these idle princes and such contemptible arms, my history must,\r\ntherefore, be filled; to which, before I descend, it will be necessary,\r\nas was at first proposed, to speak of the origin of Florence, that it\r\nmay be clearly understood what was the state of the city in those times,\r\nand by what means, through the labours of a thousand years, she became\r\nso imbecile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe custom of ancient republics to plant colonies, and the advantage of\r\nit--Increased population tends to make countries more healthy--Origin\r\nof Florence--Aggrandizement of Florence--Origin of the name of\r\nFlorence--Destruction of Florence by Totila--The Florentines\r\ntake Fiesole--The first division in Florence, and the cause of\r\nit--Buondelmonti--Buondelmonti slain--Guelphs and Ghibellines in\r\nFlorence--Guelphic families--Ghibelline families--The two factions come\r\nto terms.\r\n\r\nAmong the great and wonderful institutions of the republics and\r\nprincipalities of antiquity that have now gone into disuse, was that by\r\nmeans of which towns and cities were from time to time established; and\r\nthere is nothing more worthy the attention of a great prince, or of\r\na well-regulated republic, or that confers so many advantages upon a\r\nprovince, as the settlement of new places, where men are drawn together\r\nfor mutual accommodation and defense. This may easily be done, by\r\nsending people to reside in recently acquired or uninhabited countries.\r\nBesides causing the establishment of new cities, these removals render\r\na conquered country more secure, and keep the inhabitants of a province\r\nproperly distributed. Thus, deriving the greatest attainable comfort,\r\nthe inhabitants increase rapidly, are more prompt to attack others, and\r\ndefend themselves with greater assurance. This custom, by the unwise\r\npractice of princes and republics, having gone into desuetude, the ruin\r\nand weakness of territories has followed; for this ordination is that\r\nby which alone empires are made secure, and countries become populated.\r\nSafety is the result of it; because the colony which a prince\r\nestablishes in a newly acquired country, is like a fortress and a\r\nguard, to keep the inhabitants in fidelity and obedience. Neither can\r\na province be wholly occupied and preserve a proper distribution of its\r\ninhabitants without this regulation; for all districts are not equally\r\nhealthy, and hence some will abound to overflowing, while others are\r\nvoid; and if there be no method of withdrawing them from places in which\r\nthey increase too rapidly, and planting them where they are too few the\r\ncountry would soon be wasted; for one part would become a desert, and\r\nthe other a dense and wretched population. And, as nature cannot repair\r\nthis disorder, it is necessary that industry should effect it, for\r\nunhealthy localities become wholesome when a numerous population is\r\nbrought into them. With cultivation the earth becomes fruitful, and the\r\nair is purified with fires--remedies which nature cannot provide. The\r\ncity of Venice proves the correctness of these remarks. Being placed in\r\na marshy and unwholesome situation, it became healthy only by the\r\nnumber of industrious individuals who were drawn together. Pisa, too, on\r\naccount of its unwholesome air, was never filled with inhabitants,\r\ntill the Saracens, having destroyed Genoa and rendered her rivers\r\nunnavigable, caused the Genoese to migrate thither in vast numbers, and\r\nthus render her populous and powerful. Where the use of colonies is not\r\nadopted, conquered countries are held with great difficulty; districts\r\nonce uninhabited still remain so, and those which populate quickly\r\nare not relieved. Hence it is that many places of the world, and\r\nparticularly in Italy, in comparison of ancient times, have become\r\ndeserts. This has wholly arisen and proceeded from the negligence of\r\nprinces, who have lost all appetite for true glory, and of republics\r\nwhich no longer possess institutions that deserve praise. In ancient\r\ntimes, by means of colonies, new cities frequently arose, and those\r\nalready begun were enlarged, as was the case with Florence, which had\r\nits beginning from Fiesole, and its increase from colonies.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly probable, as Dante and Giovanni Villani show, that the\r\ncity of Fiesole, being situate upon the summit of the mountain, in\r\norder that her markets might be more frequented, and afford greater\r\naccommodation for those who brought merchandise, would appoint the place\r\nin which to told them, not upon the hill, but in the plain, between the\r\nfoot of the mountain and the river Arno. I imagine these markets to have\r\noccasioned the first erections that were made in those places, and\r\nto have induced merchants to wish for commodious warehouses for the\r\nreception of their goods, and which, in time, became substantial\r\nbuildings. And afterward, when the Romans, having conquered the\r\nCarthaginians, rendered Italy secure from foreign invasion, these\r\nbuildings would greatly increase; for men never endure inconveniences\r\nunless some powerful necessity compels them. Thus, although the fear\r\nof war induces a willingness to occupy places strong and difficult of\r\naccess, as soon as the cause of alarm is removed, men gladly resort to\r\nmore convenient and easily attainable localities. Hence, the security\r\nto which the reputation of the Roman republic gave birth, caused the\r\ninhabitants, having begun in the manner described, to increase so much\r\nas to form a town, this was at first called the Villa Arnina. After this\r\noccurred the civil wars between Marius and Sylla; then those of Cæsar,\r\nand Pompey; and next those of the murderers of Cæsar, and the parties\r\nwho undertook to avenge his death. Therefore, first by Sylla, and\r\nafterward by the three Roman citizens, who, having avenged the death\r\nof Cæsar, divided the empire among themselves, colonies were sent to\r\nFiesole, which, either in part or in whole, fixed their habitations in\r\nthe plain, near to the then rising town. By this increase, the place\r\nbecame so filled with dwellings, that it might with propriety be\r\nenumerated among the cities of Italy.\r\n\r\nThere are various opinions concerning the derivation of the word\r\nFlorentia. Some suppose it to come from Florinus, one of the principal\r\npersons of the colony; others think it was originally not Florentia, but\r\nFluentia, and suppose the word derived from _fluente_, or flowing of the\r\nArno; and in support of their opinion, adduce a passage from Pliny, who\r\nsays, \"the Fluentini are near the flowing of the Arno.\" This, however,\r\nmay be incorrect, for Pliny speaks of the locality of the Florentini,\r\nnot of the name by which they were known. And it seems as if the word\r\nFluentini were a corruption, because Frontinus and Cornelius Tacitus,\r\nwho wrote at nearly the same period as Pliny, call them Florentia and\r\nFlorentini; for, in the time of Tiberius, they were governed like\r\nthe other cities of Italy. Besides, Cornelius refers to the coming of\r\nambassadors from the Florentines, to beg of the emperor that the waters\r\nof the Chiane might not be allowed to overflow their country; and it is\r\nnot at all reasonable that the city should have two names at the same\r\ntime. Therefore I think that, however derived, the name was always\r\nFlorentia, and that whatever the origin might be, it occurred under the\r\nRoman empire, and began to be noticed by writers in the times of the\r\nfirst emperors.\r\n\r\nWhen the Roman empire was afflicted by the barbarians, Florence was\r\ndestroyed by Totila, king of the Ostrogoths; and after a period of two\r\nhundred and fifty years, rebuilt by Charlemagne; from whose time, till\r\nthe year 1215, she participated in the fortune of the rest of Italy;\r\nand, during this period, first the descendants of Charles, then the\r\nBerengarii, and lastly the German emperors, governed her, as in our\r\ngeneral treatise we have shown. Nor could the Florentines, during those\r\nages, increase in numbers, or effect anything worthy of memory,\r\non account of the influence of those to whom they were subject.\r\nNevertheless, in the year 1010, upon the feast of St. Romolo, a solemn\r\nday with the Fiesolani, they took and destroyed Fiesole, which must have\r\nbeen performed either with the consent of the emperors, or during the\r\ninterim from the death of one to the creation of his successor, when\r\nall assumed a larger share of liberty. But then the pontiffs acquired\r\ngreater influence, and the authority of the German emperors was in its\r\nwane, all the places of Italy governed themselves with less respect for\r\nthe prince; so that, in the time of Henry III. the mind of the country\r\nwas divided between the emperor and the church. However, the Florentines\r\nkept themselves united until the year 1215, rendering obedience to the\r\nruling power, and anxious only to preserve their own safety. But, as\r\nthe diseases which attack our bodies are more dangerous and mortal in\r\nproportion as they are delayed, so Florence, though late to take part in\r\nthe sects of Italy, was afterward the more afflicted by them. The cause\r\nof her first division is well known, having been recorded by Dante and\r\nmany other writers; I shall, however, briefly notice it.\r\n\r\nAmong the most powerful families of Florence were the Buondelmonti and\r\nthe Uberti; next to these were the Amidei and the Donati. Of the Donati\r\nfamily there was a rich widow who had a daughter of exquisite beauty,\r\nfor whom, in her own mind, she had fixed upon Buondelmonti, a young\r\ngentleman, the head of the Buondelmonti family, as her husband; but\r\neither from negligence, or, because she thought it might be accomplished\r\nat any time, she had not made known her intention, when it happened that\r\nthe cavalier betrothed himself to a maiden of the Amidei family. This\r\ngrieved the Donati widow exceedingly; but she hoped, with her daughter's\r\nbeauty, to disturb the arrangement before the celebration of the\r\nmarriage; and from an upper apartment, seeing Buondelmonti approach her\r\nhouse alone, she descended, and as he was passing she said to him, \"I\r\nam glad to learn you have chosen a wife, although I had reserved my\r\ndaughter for you;\" and, pushing the door open, presented her to his\r\nview. The cavalier, seeing the beauty of the girl, which was very\r\nuncommon, and considering the nobility of her blood, and her portion not\r\nbeing inferior to that of the lady whom he had chosen, became inflamed\r\nwith such an ardent desire to possess her, that, not thinking of the\r\npromise given, or the injury he committed in breaking it, or of the\r\nevils which his breach of faith might bring upon himself, said, \"Since\r\nyou have reserved her for me, I should be very ungrateful indeed to\r\nrefuse her, being yet at liberty to choose;\" and without any delay\r\nmarried her. As soon as the fact became known, the Amidei and the\r\nUberti, whose families were allied, were filled with rage, and having\r\nassembled with many others, connections of the parties, they concluded\r\nthat the injury could not be tolerated without disgrace, and that the\r\nonly vengeance proportionate to the enormity of the offence would be to\r\nput Buondelmonti to death. And although some took into consideration the\r\nevils that might ensue upon it, Mosca Lamberti said, that those who talk\r\nof many things effect nothing, using that trite and common adage, _Cosa\r\nfatta capo ha_. Thereupon, they appointed to the execution of the murder\r\nMosca himself, Stiatti Uberti, Lambertuccio Amidei, and Oderigo Fifanti,\r\nwho, on the morning of Easter day, concealed themselves in a house of\r\nthe Amidei, situate between the old bridge and St. Stephen's, and as\r\nBuondelmonti was passing upon a white horse, thinking it as easy a\r\nmatter to forget an injury as reject an alliance, he was attacked by\r\nthem at the foot of the bridge, and slain close by a statue of Mars.\r\nThis murder divided the whole city; one party espousing the cause of\r\nthe Buondelmonti, the other that of the Uberti; and as these families\r\npossessed men and means of defense, they contended with each other for\r\nmany years, without one being able to destroy the other.\r\n\r\nFlorence continued in these troubles till the time of Frederick II.,\r\nwho, being king of Naples, endeavored to strengthen himself against the\r\nchurch; and, to give greater stability to his power in Tuscany, favored\r\nthe Uberti and their followers, who, with his assistance, expelled the\r\nBuondelmonti; thus our city, as all the rest of Italy had long time\r\nbeen, became divided into Guelphs and Ghibellines; and as it will not\r\nbe superfluous, I shall record the names of the families which took part\r\nwith each faction. Those who adopted the cause of the Guelphs were\r\nthe Buondelmonti, Nerli, Rossi, Frescobaldi, Mozzi, Bardi, Pulci,\r\nGherardini, Foraboschi, Bagnesi, Guidalotti, Sacchetti, Manieri,\r\nLucardesi, Chiaramontesi, Compiobbesi, Cavalcanti, Giandonati,\r\nGianfigliazzi, Scali, Gualterotti, Importuni, Bostichi, Tornaquinci,\r\nVecchietti, Tosinghi, Arrigucci, Agli, Sizi, Adimari, Visdomini, Donati,\r\nPassi, della Bella, Ardinghi, Tedaldi, Cerchi. Of the Ghibelline\r\nfaction were the Uberti, Manelli, Ubriachi, Fifanti, Amidei, Infangati,\r\nMalespini, Scolari, Guidi, Galli, Cappiardi, Lamberti, Soldanieri,\r\nCipriani, Toschi, Amieri, Palermini, Migliorelli, Pigli, Barucci,\r\nCattani, Agolanti, Brunelleschi, Caponsacchi, Elisei, Abati, Tidaldini,\r\nGiuochi, and Galigai. Besides the noble families on each side above\r\nenumerated, each party was joined by many of the higher ranks of the\r\npeople, so that the whole city was corrupted with this division. The\r\nGuelphs being expelled, took refuge in the Upper Val d'Arno, where\r\npart of their castles and strongholds were situated, and where they\r\nstrengthened and fortified themselves against the attacks of their\r\nenemies. But, upon the death of Frederick, the most unbiased men, and\r\nthose who had the greatest authority with the people, considered that it\r\nwould be better to effect the reunion of the city, than, by keeping her\r\ndivided, cause her ruin. They therefore induced the Guelphs to forget\r\ntheir injuries and return, and the Ghibellines to lay aside their\r\njealousies and receive them with cordiality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nNew form of government in Florence--Military establishments--The\r\ngreatness of Florence--Movements of the Ghibellines--Ghibellines\r\ndriven out of the city--Guelphs routed by the forces of the king of\r\nNaples--Florence in the power of the king of Naples--Project of\r\nthe Ghibellines to destroy Florence opposed by Farinata degli\r\nUberti--Adventures of the Guelphs of Florence--The pope gives his\r\nstandard to the Guelphs--Fears of the Ghibellines and their preparations\r\nfor the defense of their power--Establishment of trades' companies, and\r\ntheir authority--Count Guido Novello expelled--He goes to Prato--The\r\nGuelphs restored to the city--The Ghibellines quit Florence--The\r\nFlorentines reform the government in favor of the Guelphs--The pope\r\nendeavors to restore the Ghibellines and excommunicates Florence--Pope\r\nNicholas III. endeavors to abate the power of Charles king of Naples.\r\n\r\nBeing united, the Florentines thought the time favorable for the\r\nordination of a free government, and that it would be desirable to\r\nprovide their means of defense before the new emperor should acquire\r\nstrength. They therefore divided the city into six parts, and elected\r\ntwelve citizens, two for each sixth, to govern the whole. These were\r\ncalled Anziani, and were elected annually. To remove the cause of those\r\nenmities which had been observed to arise from judicial decisions, they\r\nprovided two judges from some other state,--one called captain of the\r\npeople, the other podesta, or provost,--whose duty it was to decide in\r\ncases, whether civil or criminal, which occurred among the people. And\r\nas order cannot be preserved without a sufficient force for the defense\r\nof it, they appointed twenty banners in the city, and seventy-six in the\r\ncountry, upon the rolls of which the names of all the youth were armed;\r\nand it was ordered that everyone should appear armed, under his banner,\r\nwhenever summoned, whether by the captain of the people or the Anziani.\r\nThey had ensigns according to the kind of arms they used, the bowmen\r\nbeing under one ensign, and the swordsmen, or those who carried a\r\ntarget, under another; and every year, upon the day of Pentecost,\r\nensigns were given with great pomp to the new men, and new leaders\r\nwere appointed for the whole establishment. To give importance to their\r\narmies, and to serve as a point of refuge for those who were exhausted\r\nin the fight, and from which, having become refreshed, they might again\r\nmake head against the enemy, they provided a large car, drawn by two\r\noxen, covered with red cloth, upon which was an ensign of white and red.\r\nWhen they intended to assemble the army, this car was brought into the\r\nNew Market, and delivered with pomp to the heads of the people. To give\r\nsolemnity to their enterprises, they had a bell called Martinella, which\r\nwas rung during a whole month before the forces left the city, in order\r\nthat the enemy might have time to provide for his defense; so great was\r\nthe virtue then existing among men, and with so much generosity of mind\r\nwere they governed, that as it is now considered a brave and prudent act\r\nto assail an unprovided enemy, in those days it would have been thought\r\ndisgraceful, and productive only of a fallacious advantage. This bell\r\nwas also taken with the army, and served to regulate the keeping and\r\nrelief of guard, and other matters necessary in the practice of war.\r\n\r\nWith these ordinations, civil and military, the Florentines established\r\ntheir liberty. Nor is it possible to imagine the power and authority\r\nFlorence in a short time acquired. She became not only the head of\r\nTuscany, but was enumerated among the first cities of Italy, and would\r\nhave attained greatness of the most exalted kind, had she not been\r\nafflicted with the continual divisions of her citizens. They remained\r\nunder the this government ten years, during which time they compelled\r\nthe people of Pistoria, Arezzo, and Sienna, to enter into league with\r\nthem; and returning with the army from Sienna, they took Volterra,\r\ndestroyed some castles, and led the inhabitants to Florence. All these\r\nenterprises were effected by the advice of the Guelphs, who were much\r\nmore powerful than the Ghibellines, for the latter were hated by the\r\npeople as well on account of their haughty bearing while in power,\r\nduring the time of Frederick, as because the church party was in more\r\nfavor than that of the emperor; for with the aid of the church they\r\nhoped to preserve their liberty, but, with the emperor, they were\r\napprehensive of losing it.\r\n\r\nThe Ghibellines, in the meantime, finding themselves divested of\r\nauthority, could not rest, but watched for an occasion of repossessing\r\nthe government; and they thought the favorable moment come, when they\r\nfound that Manfred, son of Frederick, had made himself sovereign of\r\nNaples, and reduced the power of the church. They, therefore, secretly\r\ncommunicated with him, to resume the management of the state, but\r\ncould not prevent their proceedings from coming to the knowledge of the\r\nAnziani, who immediately summoned the Uberti to appear before them; but\r\ninstead of obeying, they took arms and fortified themselves in their\r\nhouses. The people, enraged at this, armed themselves, and with the\r\nassistance of the Guelphs, compelled them to quit the city, and,\r\nwith the whole Ghibelline party, withdraw to Sienna. They then asked\r\nassistance of Manfred king of Naples, and by the able conduct of\r\nFarinata degli Uberti, the Guelphs were routed by the king's forces\r\nupon the river Arbia, with so great slaughter, that those who escaped,\r\nthinking Florence lost, did not return thither, but sought refuge at\r\nLucca.\r\n\r\nManfred sent the Count Giordano, a man of considerable reputation\r\nin arms, to command his forces. He after the victory, went with the\r\nGhibellines to Florence, and reduced the city entirely to the king's\r\nauthority, annulling the magistracies and every other institution that\r\nretained any appearance of freedom. This injury, committed with little\r\nprudence, excited the ardent animosity of the people, and their enmity\r\nagainst the Ghibellines, whose ruin it eventually caused, was increased\r\nto the highest pitch. The necessities of the kingdom compelling the\r\nCount Giordano to return to Naples, he left at Florence as regal vicar\r\nthe Count Guido Novallo, lord of Casentino, who called a council of\r\nGhibellines at Empoli. There it was concluded, with only one dissenting\r\nvoice, that in order to preserve their power in Tuscany, it would be\r\nnecessary to destroy Florence, as the only means of compelling the\r\nGuelphs to withdraw their support from the party of the church. To this\r\nso cruel a sentence, given against such a noble city, there was not a\r\ncitizen who offered any opposition, except Farinata degli Uberti, who\r\nopenly defended her, saying he had not encountered so many dangers and\r\ndifficulties, but in the hope of returning to his country; that he still\r\nwished for what he had so earnestly sought, nor would he refuse the\r\nblessing which fortune now presented, even though by using it, he were\r\nto become as much an enemy of those who thought otherwise, as he had\r\nbeen of the Guelphs; and that no one need be afraid the city would\r\noccasion the ruin of their country, for he hoped that the valor which\r\nhad expelled the Guelphs, would be sufficient to defend her. Farinata\r\nwas a man of undaunted resolution, and excelled greatly in military\r\naffairs: being the head of the Ghibelline party, and in high estimation\r\nwith Manfred, his authority put a stop to the discussion, and induced\r\nthe rest to think of some other means of preserving their power.\r\n\r\nThe Lucchese being threatened with the anger of the count, for affording\r\nrefuge to the Guelphs after the battle of the Arbia, could allow them\r\nto remain no longer; so leaving Lucca, they went to Bologna, from whence\r\nthey were called by the Guelphs of Parma against the Ghibellines of that\r\ncity, where, having overcome the enemy, the possessions of the latter\r\nwere assigned to them; so that having increased in honors and riches,\r\nand learning that Pope Clement had invited Charles of Anjou to take the\r\nkingdom from Manfred, they sent ambassadors to the pope to offer him\r\ntheir services. His holiness not only received them as friends, but gave\r\nthem a standard upon which his insignia were wrought. It was ever after\r\nborne by the Guelphs in battle, and is still used at Florence. Charles\r\nhaving taken the kingdom from Manfred, and slain him, to which success\r\nthe Guelphs of Florence had contributed, their party became more\r\npowerful, and that of the Ghibellines proportionately weaker. In\r\nconsequence of this, those who with Count Novello governed the city,\r\nthought it would be advisable to attach to themselves, with some\r\nconcession, the people whom they had previously aggravated with every\r\nspecies of injury; but these remedies which, if applied before the\r\nnecessity came would have been beneficial, being offered when they were\r\nno longer considered favors, not only failed of producing any beneficial\r\nresults to the donors, but hastened their ruin. Thinking, however, to\r\nwin them to their interests, they restored some of the honors of which\r\nthey had deprived them. They elected thirty-six citizens from the higher\r\nrank of the people, to whom, with two cavaliers, knights or gentlemen,\r\nbrought from Bologna, the reformation of the government of the city\r\nwas confided. As soon as they met, they classed the whole of the\r\npeople according to their arts or trades, and over each art appointed a\r\nmagistrate, whose duty was to distribute justice to those placed under\r\nhim. They gave to each company or trade a banner, under which every man\r\nwas expected to appear armed, whenever the city required it. These arts\r\nwere at first twelve, seven major and five minor. The minor arts were\r\nafterward increased to fourteen, so that the whole made, as at present,\r\ntwenty-one. The thirty-six reformers also effected other changes for the\r\ncommon good.\r\n\r\nCount Guido proposed to lay a tax upon the citizens for the support of\r\nthe soldiery; but during the discussion found so much difficulty, that\r\nhe did not dare to use force to obtain it; and thinking he had now lost\r\nthe government, called together the leaders of the Ghibellines, and they\r\ndetermined to wrest from the people those powers which they had with so\r\nlittle prudence conceded. When they thought they had sufficient force,\r\nthe thirty-six being assembled, they caused a tumult to be raised, which\r\nso alarmed them that they retired to their houses, when suddenly the\r\nbanners of the Arts were unfurled, and many armed men drawn to them.\r\nThese, learning that Count Guido and his followers were at St. John's,\r\nmoved toward the Holy Trinity, and chose Giovanni Soldanieri for their\r\nleader. The count, on the other hand, being informed where the people\r\nwere assembled, proceeded in that direction; nor did the people shun the\r\nfight, for, meeting their enemies where now stands the residence of the\r\nTornaquinci, they put the count to flight, with the loss of many of his\r\nfollowers. Terrified with this result, he was afraid his enemies would\r\nattack him in the night, and that his own party, finding themselves\r\nbeaten, would murder him. This impression took such hold of his mind\r\nthat, without attempting any other remedy, he sought his safety rather\r\nin flight than in combat, and, contrary to the advice of the rectors,\r\nwent with all his people to Prato. But, on finding himself in a place\r\nof safety, his fears fled; perceiving his error he wished to correct it,\r\nand on the following day, as soon as light appeared, he returned\r\nwith his people to Florence, to enter the city by force which he had\r\nabandoned in cowardice. But his design did not succeed; for the people,\r\nwho had had difficulty in expelling him, kept him out with facility; so\r\nthat with grief and shame he went to the Casentino, and the Ghibellines\r\nwithdrew to their villas.\r\n\r\nThe people being victorious, by the advice of those who loved the good\r\nof the republic, determined to reunite the city, and recall all the\r\ncitizens as well Guelph as Ghibelline, who yet remained without. The\r\nGuelphs returned, after having been expelled six years; the recent\r\noffences of the Ghibellines were forgiven, and themselves restored to\r\ntheir country. They were, however, most cordially hated, both by the\r\npeople and the Guelphs, for the latter could not forget their exile,\r\nand the former but too well remembered their tyranny when they were in\r\npower; the result was, that the minds of neither party became settled.\r\n\r\nWhile affairs were in this state at Florence, a report prevailed that\r\nCorradino, nephew of Manfred, was coming with a force from Germany, for\r\nthe conquest of Naples; this gave the Ghibellines hope of recovering\r\npower, and the Guelphs, considering how they should provide for their\r\nsecurity, requested assistance from Charles for their defense, in\r\ncase of the passage of Corradino. The coming of the forces of Charles\r\nrendered the Guelphs insolent, and so alarmed the Ghibellines that they\r\nfled the city, without being driven out, two days before the arrival of\r\nthe troops.\r\n\r\nThe Ghibellines having departed, the Florentines reorganized the\r\ngovernment of the city, and elected twelve men who, as the supreme\r\npower, were to hold their magistracy two months, and were not called\r\nAnziani or \"ancients,\" but Buono Uomini or \"good men.\" They also formed\r\na council of eighty citizens, which they called the Credenza. Besides\r\nthese, from each sixth, thirty citizens were chosen, who, with the\r\nCredenza and the twelve Buono Uomini, were called the General Council.\r\nThey also appointed another council of one hundred and twenty citizens,\r\nelected from the people and the nobility, to which all those things\r\nwere finally referred that had undergone the consideration of the other\r\ncouncils, and which distributed the offices of the republic. Having\r\nformed this government, they strengthened the Guelphic party by\r\nappointing its friends to the principal offices of state, and a variety\r\nof other measures, that they might be enabled to defend themselves\r\nagainst the Ghibellines, whose property they divided into three parts,\r\none of which was applied to the public use, another to the Capitani, and\r\nthe third was assigned to the Guelphs, in satisfaction of the injuries\r\nthey had received. The pope, too, in order to keep Tuscany in the\r\nGuelphic interest, made Charles imperial vicar over the province.\r\nWhile the Florentines, by virtue of the new government, preserved their\r\ninfluence at home by laws, and abroad with arms, the pope died, and\r\nafter a dispute, which continued two years, Gregory X. was elected,\r\nbeing then in Syria, where he had long lived; but not having witnessed\r\nthe working of parties, he did not estimate them in the manner his\r\npredecessors had done, and passing through Florence on his way to\r\nFrance, he thought it would be the office of a good pastor to unite the\r\ncity, and so far succeeded that the Florentines consented to receive the\r\nSyndics of the Ghibellines in Florence to consider the terms of their\r\nrecall. They effected an agreement, but the Ghibellines without were so\r\nterrified that they did not venture to return. The pope laid the whole\r\nblame upon the city, and being enraged excommunicated her, in which\r\nstate of contumacy she remained as long as the pontiff lived; but was\r\nreblessed by his successor Innocent V.\r\n\r\nThe pontificate was afterward occupied by Nicholas III. of the Orsini\r\nfamily. It has to be remarked that it was invariably the custom of the\r\npopes to be jealous of those whose power in Italy had become great, even\r\nwhen its growth had been occasioned by the favors of the church; and as\r\nthey always endeavored to destroy it, frequent troubles and changes were\r\nthe result. Their fear of a powerful person caused them to increase the\r\ninfluence of one previously weak; his becoming great caused him also to\r\nbe feared, and his being feared made them seek the means of destroying\r\nhim. This mode of thinking and operation occasioned the kingdom of\r\nNaples to be taken from Manfred and given to Charles, but as soon as\r\nthe latter became powerful his ruin was resolved upon. Actuated by\r\nthese motives, Nicholas III. contrived that, with the influence of the\r\nemperor, the government of Tuscany should be taken from Charles, and\r\nLatino his legate was therefore sent into the province in the name of\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nChanges in Florence--The Ghibellines recalled--New form of government in\r\nFlorence--The Signory created--Victory over the Aretins--The Gonfalonier\r\nof Justice created--Ubaldo Ruffoli the first Gonfalonier--Giano della\r\nBella--New reform by his advice--Giano della Bella becomes a voluntary\r\nexile--Dissensions between the people and the nobility--The tumults\r\ncomposed--Reform of Government--Public buildings--The prosperous state\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nFlorence was at this time in a very unhappy condition; for the great\r\nGuelphic families had become insolent, and set aside the authority\r\nof the magistrates; so that murders and other atrocities were daily\r\ncommitted, and the perpetrators escaped unpunished, under the protection\r\nof one or other of the nobility. The leaders of the people, in order\r\nto restrain this insolence, determined to recall those who had been\r\nexpelled, and thus gave the legate an opportunity of uniting the city.\r\nThe Ghibellines returned, and, instead of twelve governors, fourteen\r\nwere appointed, seven for each party, who held their office one year,\r\nand were to be chosen by the pope. The Florentines lived under this\r\ngovernment two years, till the pontificate of Martin, who restored to\r\nCharles all the authority which had been taken from him by Nicholas, so\r\nthat parties were again active in Tuscany; for the Florentines took arms\r\nagainst the emperor's governor, and to deprive the Ghibellines of power,\r\nand restrain the nobility, established a new form of government. This\r\nwas in the year 1282, and the companies of the Arts, since magistrates\r\nhad been appointed and colors given to them, had acquired so great\r\ninfluence, that of their own authority they ordered that, instead of\r\nfourteen citizens, three should be appointed and called Priors, to hold\r\nthe government of the republic two months, and chosen from either the\r\npeople or the nobility. After the expiration of the first magistracy\r\nthey were augmented to six, that one might be chosen from each sixth\r\nof the city, and this number was preserved till the year 1342, when the\r\ncity was divided into quarters, and the Priors became eight, although\r\nupon some occasions during the interim they were twelve.\r\n\r\nThis government, as will be seen hereafter, occasioned the ruin of\r\nthe nobility; for the people by various causes excluded them from all\r\nparticipation in it, and then trampled upon them without respect. The\r\nnobles at first, owing to their divisions among themselves, made no\r\nopposition; and each being anxious to rob the other of influence in the\r\nstate, they lost it altogether. To this government a palace was given,\r\nin which they were to reside constantly, and all requisite officers\r\nwere appointed; it having been previously the custom of councils and\r\nmagistrates to assemble in churches. At first they were only called\r\nPriors, but to increase their distinction the word signori, or lords,\r\nwas soon afterward adopted. The Florentines remained for some time in\r\ndomestic quiet, during which they made war with the Aretins for having\r\nexpelled the Guelphs, and obtained a complete victory over them at\r\nCampaldino. The city being increased in riches and population, it was\r\nfound expedient to extend the walls, the circle of which was enlarged to\r\nthe extent it at present remains, although its diameter was previously\r\nonly the space between the old bridge and the church of St. Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nWars abroad and peace within the city had caused the Guelph and\r\nGhibelline factions to become almost extinct; and the only party feeling\r\nwhich seemed occasionally to glow, was that which naturally exists in\r\nall cities between the higher classes and the people; for the latter,\r\nwishing to live in conformity with the laws, and the former to be\r\nthemselves the rulers of the people, it was not possible for them to\r\nabide in perfect amity together. This ungenial disposition, while their\r\nfear of the Ghibellines kept them in order, did not discover itself, but\r\nno sooner were they subdued than it broke forth, and not a day passed\r\nwithout some of the populace being injured, while the laws were\r\ninsufficient to procure redress, for every noble with his relations\r\nand friends defended himself against the forces of the Priors and\r\nthe Capitano. To remedy this evil, the leaders of the Arts' companies\r\nordered that every Signory at the time of entering upon the duties of\r\noffice should appoint a Gonfalonier of Justice, chosen from the people,\r\nand place a thousand armed men at his disposal divided into twenty\r\ncompanies of fifty men each, and that he, with his gonfalon or banner\r\nand his forces, should be ready to enforce the execution of the laws\r\nwhenever called upon, either by the Signors themselves or the Capitano.\r\nThe first elected to this high office was Ubaldo Ruffoli. This man\r\nunfurled his gonfalon, and destroyed the houses of the Galletti, on\r\naccount of a member of that family having slain one of the Florentine\r\npeople in France. The violent animosities among the nobility enabled\r\nthe companies of the Arts to establish this law with facility; and the\r\nformer no sooner saw the provision which had been made against them than\r\nthey felt the acrimonious spirit with which it was enforced. At first\r\nit impressed them with greater terror, but they soon after returned to\r\ntheir accustomed insolence, for one or more of their body always\r\nmaking part of the Signory, gave them opportunities of impeding the\r\nGonfalonier, so that he could not perform the duties of his office.\r\nBesides this, the accuser always required a witness of the injury he had\r\nreceived, and no one dared to give evidence against the nobility. Thus\r\nin a short time Florence again fell into the same disorders as before,\r\nand the tyranny exercised against the people was as great as ever; for\r\nthe decisions of justice were either prevented or delayed, and sentences\r\nwere not carried into execution.\r\n\r\nIn this unhappy state, the people not knowing what to do, Giano della\r\nBella, of a very noble family, and a lover of liberty, encouraged the\r\nheads of the Arts to reform the constitution of the city; and by his\r\nadvice it was ordered that the Gonfalonier should reside with the\r\nPriors, and have four thousand men at his command. They deprived\r\nthe nobility of the right to sit in the Signory. They condemned the\r\nassociates of a criminal to the same penalty as himself, and ordered\r\nthat public report should be taken as evidence. By these laws, which\r\nwere called the ordinations of justice, the people acquired great\r\ninfluence, and Giano della Bella not a small share of trouble; for he\r\nwas thoroughly hated by the great, as the destroyer of their power,\r\nwhile the opulent among the people envied him, for they thought he\r\npossessed too great authority. This became very evident upon the first\r\noccasion that presented itself.\r\n\r\nIt happened that a man from the class of the people was killed in a\r\nriot, in which several of the nobility had taken a part, and among the\r\nrest Corso Donati, to whom, as the most forward of the party, the death\r\nwas attributed. He was, therefore, taken by the captain of the people,\r\nand whether he was really innocent of the crime or the Capitano was\r\nafraid of condemning him, he was acquitted. This acquittal displeased\r\nthe people so much, that, seizing their arms, they ran to the house of\r\nGiano della Bella, to beg that he would compel the execution of those\r\nlaws which he had himself made. Giano, who wished Corso to be punished,\r\ndid not insist upon their laying down their arms, as many were of\r\nopinion he ought to have done, but advised them to go to the\r\nSignory, complain of the fact, and beg that they would take it into\r\nconsideration. The people, full of wrath, thinking themselves insulted\r\nby the Capitano and abandoned by Giano della Bella, instead of going\r\nto the Signory went to the palace of the Capitano, of which they made\r\nthemselves masters, and plundered it.\r\n\r\nThis outrage displeased the whole city, and those who wished the ruin of\r\nGiano laid the entire blame upon him; and as in the succeeding Signory\r\nthere was an enemy of his, he was accused to the Capitano as the\r\noriginator of the riot. While the case was being tried, the people took\r\narms, and, proceeding to his house, offered to defend him against the\r\nSignory and his enemies. Giano, however, did not wish to put this burst\r\nof popular favor to the proof, or trust his life to the magistrates, for\r\nhe feared the malignity of the latter and the instability of the former;\r\nso, in order to remove an occasion for his enemies to injure him, or\r\nhis friends to offend the laws, he determined to withdraw, deliver his\r\ncountrymen from the fear they had of him, and, leaving the city which\r\nat his own charge and peril he had delivered from the servitude of the\r\ngreat, become a voluntary exile.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Giano della Bella the nobility began to entertain\r\nhopes of recovering their authority; and judging their misfortune to\r\nhave arisen from their divisions, they sent two of their body to the\r\nSignory, which they thought was favorable to them, to beg they would be\r\npleased to moderate the severity of the laws made against them. As soon\r\nas their demand became known, the minds of the people were much excited;\r\nfor they were afraid the Signors would submit to them; and so, between\r\nthe desire of the nobility and the jealousy of the people, arms were\r\nresorted to. The nobility were drawn together in three places: near the\r\nchurch of St. John, in the New Market, and in the Piazza of the Mozzi,\r\nunder three leaders, Forese Adimari, Vanni de Mozzi, and Geri Spini.\r\nThe people assembled in immense numbers, under their ensigns, before the\r\npalace of the Signory, which at that time was situated near St. Procolo;\r\nand, as they suspected the integrity of the Signory, they added six\r\ncitizens to their number to take part in the management of affairs.\r\n\r\nWhile both parties were preparing for the fight, some individuals, as\r\nwell of the people as of the nobility, accompanied by a few priests of\r\nrespectable character, mingled among them for the purpose of effecting\r\na pacification, reminding the nobility that their loss of power, and the\r\nlaws which were made against them, had been occasioned by their haughty\r\nconduct, and the mischievous tendency of their proceedings; that\r\nresorting to arms to recover by force what they had lost by illiberal\r\nmeasures and disunion, would tend to the destruction of their country\r\nand increase the difficulties of their own position; that they should\r\nbear in mind that the people, both in riches, numbers, and hatred, were\r\nfar stronger than they; and that their nobility, on account of which\r\nthey assumed to be above others, did not contribute to win battles, and\r\nwould be found, when they came to arms, to be but an empty name, and\r\ninsufficient to defend them against so many. On the other hand, they\r\nreminded the people that it is not prudent to wish always to have the\r\nlast blow; that it is an injudicious step to drive men to desperation,\r\nfor he who is without hope is also without fear; that they ought not\r\nto forget that in the wars the nobility had always done honor to the\r\ncountry, and therefore it was neither wise nor just to pursue them\r\nwith so much bitterness; and that although the nobility could bear with\r\npatience the loss of the supreme magistracy, they could not endure that,\r\nby the existing laws, it should be in the power of everyone to drive\r\nthem from their country; and, therefore, it would be well to qualify\r\nthese laws, and, in furtherance of so good a result, be better to lay\r\ndown their arms than, trusting to numbers, try the fortune of a battle;\r\nfor it is often seen that the many are overcome by the few. Variety of\r\nopinion was found among the people; many wished to decide the question\r\nby arms at once, for they were assured it would have to be done some\r\ntime, and that it would be better to do so then than delay till\r\nthe enemy had acquired greater strength; and that if they thought a\r\nmitigation of the laws would satisfy them, that then they would be glad\r\nto comply, but that the pride of the nobility was so great they would\r\nnot submit unless they were compelled. To many others, who were more\r\npeaceable and better disposed, it appeared a less evil to qualify the\r\nlaws a little than to come to battle; and their opinion prevailing, it\r\nwas provided that no accusation against the nobility could be received\r\nunless supported with sufficient testimony.\r\n\r\nAlthough arms were laid aside, both parties remained full of suspicion,\r\nand each fortified itself with men and places of strength. The people\r\nreorganized the government, and lessened the number of its officers, to\r\nwhich measure they were induced by finding that the Signors appointed\r\nfrom the families, of which the following were the heads, had been\r\nfavorable to the nobility, viz.: the Mancini, Magalotti, Altoviti,\r\nPeruzzi, and Cerretani. Having settled the government, for the greater\r\nmagnificence and security of the Signory, they laid the foundation of\r\ntheir palace; and to make space for the piazza, removed the houses that\r\nhad belonged to the Uberti; they also at the same period commenced the\r\npublic prisons. These buildings were completed in a few years; nor did\r\nour city ever enjoy a greater state of prosperity than in those times:\r\nfilled with men of great wealth and reputation; possessing within her\r\nwalls 30,000 men capable of bearing arms, and in the country 70,000,\r\nwhile the whole of Tuscany, either as subjects or friends, owed\r\nobedience to Florence. And although there might be some indignation and\r\njealousy between the nobility and the people, they did not produce any\r\nevil effect, but all lived together in unity and peace. And if this\r\npeace had not been disturbed by internal enmities there would have been\r\nno cause of apprehension whatever, for the city had nothing to fear\r\neither from the empire or from those citizens whom political reasons\r\nkept from their homes, and was in condition to meet all the states of\r\nItaly with her own forces. The evil, however, which external powers\r\ncould not effect, was brought about by those within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Cerchi and the Donati--Origin of the Bianca and Nera factions\r\nin Pistoia--They come to Florence--Open enmity of the Donati and the\r\nCerchi--Their first conflict--The Cerchi head the Bianca faction--The\r\nDonati take part with the Nera--The pope's legate at Florence increases\r\nthe confusion with an interdict--New affray between the Cerchi and the\r\nDonati--The Donati and others of the Nera faction banished by the advice\r\nof Dante Alighieri--Charles of Valois sent by the pope to Florence--The\r\nFlorentines suspect him--Corso Donati and the rest of the Nera party\r\nreturn to Florence--Veri Cerchi flies--The pope's legate again in\r\nFlorence--The city again interdicted--New disturbances--The Bianchi\r\nbanished--Dante banished--Corso Donati excites fresh troubles--The\r\npope's legate endeavors to restore the emigrants but does not\r\nsucceed--Great fire in Florence.\r\n\r\nThe Cerchi and the Donati were, for riches, nobility, and the number\r\nand influence of their followers, perhaps the two most distinguished\r\nfamilies in Florence. Being neighbors, both in the city and the country,\r\nthere had arisen between them some slight displeasure, which, however,\r\nhad not occasioned an open quarrel, and perhaps never would have\r\nproduced any serious effect if the malignant humors had not been\r\nincreased by new causes. Among the first families of Pistoia was the\r\nCancellieri. It happened that Lore, son of Gulielmo, and Geri, son of\r\nBertacca, both of this family, playing together, and coming to words,\r\nGeri was slightly wounded by Lore. This displeased Gulielmo; and,\r\ndesigning by a suitable apology to remove all cause of further\r\nanimosity, he ordered his son to go to the house of the father of the\r\nyouth whom he had wounded and ask pardon. Lore obeyed his father; but\r\nthis act of virtue failed to soften the cruel mind of Bertacca, and\r\nhaving caused Lore to be seized, in order to add the greatest indignity\r\nto his brutal act, he ordered his servants to chop off the youth's hand\r\nupon a block used for cutting meat upon, and then said to him, \"Go to\r\nthy father, and tell him that sword wounds are cured with iron and not\r\nwith words.\"\r\n\r\nThe unfeeling barbarity of this act so greatly exasperated Gulielmo that\r\nhe ordered his people to take arms for his revenge. Bertacca prepared\r\nfor his defense, and not only that family, but the whole city of\r\nPistoia, became divided. And as the Cancellieri were descended from\r\na Cancelliere who had had two wives, of whom one was called Bianca\r\n(white), one party was named by those who were descended from her\r\nBIANCA; and the other, by way of greater distinction, was called NERA\r\n(black). Much and long-continued strife took place between the two,\r\nattended with the death of many men and the destruction of much\r\nproperty; and not being able to effect a union among themselves, but\r\nweary of the evil, and anxious either to bring it to an end, or, by\r\nengaging others in their quarrel, increase it, they came to Florence,\r\nwhere the Neri, on account of their familiarity with the Donati, were\r\nfavored by Corso, the head of that family; and on this account the\r\nBianchi, that they might have a powerful head to defend them against the\r\nDonati, had recourse to Veri de Cerchi, a man in no respect inferior to\r\nCorso.\r\n\r\nThis quarrel, and the parties in it, brought from Pistoia, increased the\r\nold animosity between the Cerchi and the Donati, and it was already\r\nso manifest, that the Priors and all well-disposed men were in hourly\r\napprehension of its breaking out, and causing a division of the whole\r\ncity. They therefore applied to the pontiff, praying that he would\r\ninterpose his authority between these turbulent parties, and provide the\r\nremedy which they found themselves unable to furnish. The pope sent\r\nfor Veri, and charged him to make peace with the Donati, at which Veri\r\nexhibited great astonishment, saying that he had no enmity against them,\r\nand that as pacification presupposes war, he did not know, there being\r\nno war between them, how peacemaking could be necessary. Veri having\r\nreturned from Rome without anything being effected, the rage of the\r\nparties increased to such a degree, that any trivial accident seemed\r\nsufficient to make it burst forth, as indeed presently happened.\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of May, during which, and upon holidays, it is the\r\ncustom of Florence to hold festivals and public rejoicings throughout\r\nthe city. Some youths of the Donati family, with their friends, upon\r\nhorseback, were standing near the church of the Holy Trinity to look\r\nat a party of ladies who were dancing; thither also came some of the\r\nCerchi, like the Donati, accompanied with many of the nobility, and,\r\nnot knowing that the Donati were before them, pushed their horses and\r\njostled them; thereupon the Donati, thinking themselves insulted, drew\r\ntheir swords, nor were the Cerchi at all backward to do the same, and\r\nnot till after the interchange of many wounds, they separated. This\r\ndisturbance was the beginning of great evils; for the whole city became\r\ndivided, the people as well as the nobility, and the parties took the\r\nnames of the Bianchi and the Neri. The Cerchi were at the head of the\r\nBianchi faction, to which adhered the Adimari, the Abati, a part of the\r\nTosinghi, of the Bardi, of the Rossi, of the Frescobaldi, of the Nerli,\r\nand of the Manelli; all the Mozzi, the Scali, Gherardini, Cavalcanti,\r\nMalespini, Bostichi, Giandonati, Vecchietti, and Arrigucci. To these\r\nwere joined many families of the people, and all the Ghibellines then\r\nin Florence, so that their great numbers gave them almost the entire\r\ngovernment of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Donati, at the head of whom was Corso, joined the Nera party, to\r\nwhich also adhered those members of the above-named families who did not\r\ntake part with the Bianchi; and besides these, the whole of the Pazzi,\r\nthe Bisdomini, Manieri, Bagnesi, Tornaquinci, Spini, Buondelmonti,\r\nGianfigliazzi, and the Brunelleschi. Nor did the evil confine itself to\r\nthe city alone, for the whole country was divided upon it, so that the\r\nCaptains of the Six Parts, and whoever were attached to the Guelphic\r\nparty or the well-being of the republic, were very much afraid that this\r\nnew division would occasion the destruction of the city, and give new\r\nlife to the Ghibelline faction. They, therefore, sent again to Pope\r\nBoniface, desiring that, unless he wished that city which had always\r\nbeen the shield of the church should either be ruined or become\r\nGhibelline, he would consider some means for her relief. The\r\npontiff thereupon sent to Florence, as his legate, Cardinal Matteo\r\nd'Acquasparta, a Portuguese, who, finding the Bianchi, as the most\r\npowerful, the least in fear, not quite submissive to him, he interdicted\r\nthe city, and left it in anger, so that greater confusion now prevailed\r\nthan had done previously to his coming.\r\n\r\nThe minds of men being in great excitement, it happened that at a\r\nfuneral which many of the Donati and the Cerchi attended, they first\r\ncame to words and then to arms, from which, however, nothing but merely\r\ntumult resulted at the moment. However, having each retired to their\r\nhouses, the Cerchi determined to attack the Donati, but, by the valor\r\nof Corso, they were repulsed and great numbers of them wounded. The city\r\nwas in arms. The laws and the Signory were set at nought by the rage\r\nof the nobility, and the best and wisest citizens were full of\r\napprehension. The Donati and their followers, being the least powerful,\r\nwere in the greatest fear, and to provide for their safety they called\r\ntogether Corso, the Captains of the Parts, and the other leaders of the\r\nNeri, and resolved to apply to the pope to appoint some personage of\r\nroyal blood, that he might reform Florence; thinking by this means to\r\novercome the Bianchi. Their meeting and determination became known to\r\nthe Priors, and the adverse party represented it as a conspiracy against\r\nthe liberties of the republic. Both parties being in arms, the Signory,\r\none of whom at that time was the poet Dante, took courage, and from his\r\nadvice and prudence, caused the people to rise for the preservation of\r\norder, and being joined by many from the country, they compelled the\r\nleaders of both parties to lay aside their arms, and banished Corso,\r\nwith many of the Neri. And as an evidence of the impartiality of their\r\nmotives, they also banished many of the Bianchi, who, however, soon\r\nafterward, under pretense of some justifiable cause, returned.\r\n\r\nCorso and his friends, thinking the pope favorable to their party,\r\nwent to Rome and laid their grievances before him, having previously\r\nforwarded a statement of them in writing. Charles of Valois, brother of\r\nthe king of France, was then at the papal court, having been called\r\ninto Italy by the king of Naples, to go over into Sicily. The pope,\r\ntherefore, at the earnest prayers of the banished Florentines, consented\r\nto send Charles to Florence, till the season suitable for his going to\r\nSicily should arrive. He therefore came, and although the Bianchi,\r\nwho then governed, were very apprehensive, still, as the head of the\r\nGuelphs, and appointed by the pope, they did not dare to oppose him, and\r\nin order to secure his friendship, they gave him authority to dispose of\r\nthe city as he thought proper.\r\n\r\nThus authorized, Charles armed all his friends and followers, which step\r\ngave the people so strong a suspicion that he designed to rob them of\r\ntheir liberty, that each took arms, and kept at his own house, in order\r\nto be ready, if Charles should make any such attempt. The Cerchi and the\r\nleaders of the Bianchi faction had acquired universal hatred by having,\r\nwhile at the head of the republic, conducted themselves with unbecoming\r\npride; and this induced Corso and the banished of the Neri party to\r\nreturn to Florence, knowing well that Charles and the Captains of\r\nthe Parts were favorable to them. And while the citizens, for fear of\r\nCharles, kept themselves in arms, Corso, with all the banished, and\r\nfollowed by many others, entered Florence without the least impediment.\r\nAnd although Veri de Cerchi was advised to oppose him, he refused to do\r\nso, saying that he wished the people of Florence, against whom he came,\r\nshould punish him. However, the contrary happened, for he was welcomed,\r\nnot punished by them; and it behooved Veri to save himself by flight.\r\n\r\nCorso, having forced the Pinti Gate, assembled his party at San Pietro\r\nMaggiore, near his own house, where, having drawn together a great\r\nnumber of friends and people desirous of change, he set at liberty\r\nall who had been imprisoned for offenses, whether against the state\r\nor against individuals. He compelled the existing Signory to withdraw\r\nprivately to their own houses, elected a new one from the people of the\r\nNeri party, and for five days plundered the leaders of the Bianchi. The\r\nCerchi, and the other heads of their faction, finding Charles opposed\r\nto them, withdrew from the city, and retired to their strongholds. And\r\nalthough at first they would not listen to the advice of the pope, they\r\nwere now compelled to turn to him for assistance, declaring that instead\r\nof uniting the city, Charles had caused greater disunion than before.\r\nThe pope again sent Matteo d'Acquasparta, his legate, who made peace\r\nbetween the Cerchi and the Donati, and strengthened it with marriages\r\nand new betrothals. But wishing that the Bianchi should participate in\r\nthe employments of the government, to which the Neri who were then at\r\nthe head of it would not consent, he withdrew, with no more satisfaction\r\nnor less enraged than on the former occasion, and left the city\r\ninterdicted for disobedience.\r\n\r\nBoth parties remained in Florence, and equally discontented; the Neri\r\nfrom seeing their enemies at hand, and apprehending the loss of their\r\npower, and the Bianchi from finding themselves without either honor or\r\nauthority; and to these natural causes of animosity new injuries\r\nwere added. Niccolo de' Cerchi, with many of his friends, went to his\r\nestates, and being arrived at the bridge of Affrico, was attacked by\r\nSimone, son of Corso Donati. The contest was obstinate, and one each\r\nside had a sorrowful conclusion; for Niccolo was slain, and Simone was\r\nso severely wounded that he died on the following night.\r\n\r\nThis event again disturbed the entire city; and although the Neri were\r\nmost to blame, they were defended by those who were at the head of\r\naffairs; and before sentence was delivered, a conspiracy of the Bianchi\r\nwith Piero Ferrante, one of the barons who had accompanied Charles,\r\nwas discovered, by whose assistance they sought to be replaced in the\r\ngovernment. The matter became known from letters addressed to him by the\r\nCerchi, although some were of opinion that they were not genuine, but\r\nwritten and pretended to be found, by the Donati, to abate the infamy\r\nwhich their party had acquired by the death of Niccolo. The whole of\r\nthe Cerchi were, however, banished,--with their followers of the Bianchi\r\nparty, of whom was Dante the poet,--their property confiscated, and\r\ntheir houses pulled down. They sought refuge, with a great number of\r\nGhibellines who had joined them, in many places, seeking fresh fortunes\r\nin new undertakings. Charles, having effected the purpose of his coming,\r\nleft the city, and returned to the pope to pursue his enterprise against\r\nSicily, in which he was neither wiser nor more fortunate than he had\r\nbeen at Florence; so that with disgrace and the loss of many of his\r\nfollowers, he withdrew to France.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Charles, Florence remained quiet. Corso alone was\r\nrestless, thinking he did not possess that sort of authority in the city\r\nwhich was due to his rank; for the government being in the hands of the\r\npeople, he saw the offices of the republic administered by many inferior\r\nto himself. Moved by passions of this kind, he endeavored, under\r\nthe pretense of an honorable design, to justify his own dishonorable\r\npurposes, and accused many citizens who had the management of the public\r\nmoney, of applying it to their private uses, and recommended that they\r\nshould be brought to justice and punished. This opinion was adopted by\r\nmany who had the same views as himself; and many in ignorance joined\r\nthem, thinking Corso actuated only by pure patriotism. On the other\r\nhand, the accused citizens, enjoying the popular favor, defended\r\nthemselves, and this difference arose to such a height, that, after\r\ncivil means, they had recourse to arms. Of the one party were Corso and\r\nLottieri, bishop of Florence, with many of the nobility and some of the\r\npeople; on the other side were the Signory, with the greater part of\r\nthe people; so that skirmishes took place in many parts of the city. The\r\nSignory, seeing their danger great, sent for aid to the Lucchese,\r\nand presently all the people of Lucca were in Florence. With their\r\nassistance the disturbances were settled for the moment, and the people\r\nretained the government and their liberty, without attempting by any\r\nother means to punish the movers of the disorder.\r\n\r\nThe pope had heard of the tumults at Florence, and sent his legate,\r\nNiccolo da Prato, to settle them, who, being in high reputation both for\r\nhis quality, learning, and mode of life, presently acquired so much of\r\nthe people's confidence, that authority was given him to establish such\r\na government as he should think proper. As he was of Ghibelline origin,\r\nhe determined to recall the banished; but designing first to gain the\r\naffections of the lower orders, he renewed the ancient companies of\r\nthe people, which increased the popular power and reduced that of the\r\nnobility. The legate, thinking the multitude on his side, now endeavored\r\nto recall the banished, and, after attempting in many ways, none of\r\nwhich succeeded, he fell so completely under the suspicion of the\r\ngovernment, that he was compelled to quit the city, and returned to the\r\npope in great wrath, leaving Florence full of confusion and suffering\r\nunder an interdict. Neither was the city disturbed with one division\r\nalone, but by many; first the enmity between the people and the\r\nnobility, then that of the Ghibellines and the Guelphs, and lastly, of\r\nthe Bianchi and the Neri. All the citizens were, therefore, in arms, for\r\nmany were dissatisfied with the departure of the legate, and wished for\r\nthe return of the banished. The first who set this disturbance on foot\r\nwere the Medici and the Guinigi, who, with the legate, had discovered\r\nthemselves in favor of the rebels; and thus skirmishes took place in\r\nmany parts of the city.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these evils a fire occurred, which first broke out at the\r\ngarden of St. Michael, in the houses of the Abati; it thence extended to\r\nthose of the Capoinsacchi, and consumed them, with those of the Macci,\r\nAmieri, Toschi, Cipriani, Lamberti, Cavalcanti, and the whole of the New\r\nMarket; from thence it spread to the gate of St. Maria, and burned it to\r\nthe ground; turning from the old bridge, it destroyed the houses of the\r\nGherardini, Pulci, Amidei, and Lucardesi, and with these so many others\r\nthat the number amounted to seventeen hundred. It was the opinion\r\nof many that this fire occurred by accident during the heat of the\r\ndisturbances. Others affirm that it was begun willfully by Neri Abati,\r\nprior of St. Pietro Scarragio, a dissolute character, fond of mischief,\r\nwho, seeing the people occupied with the combat, took the opportunity\r\nof committing a wicked act, for which the citizens, being thus employed,\r\ncould offer no remedy. And to insure his success, he set fire to the\r\nhouse of his own brotherhood, where he had the best opportunity of doing\r\nit. This was in the year 1304, Florence being afflicted both with fire\r\nand the sword. Corso Donati alone remained unarmed in so many tumults;\r\nfor he thought he would more easily become the arbitrator between the\r\ncontending parties when, weary of strife, they should be inclined to\r\naccommodation. They laid down their arms, however, rather from satiety\r\nof evil than from any desire of union; and the only consequence was,\r\nthat the banished were not recalled, and the party which favored them\r\nremained inferior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe emigrants attempt to re-enter Florence, but are not allowed to do\r\nso--The companies of the people restored--Restless conduct of\r\nCorso Donati--The ruin of Corso Donati--Corso Donati accused\r\nand condemned--Riot at the house of Corso--Death of Corso--His\r\ncharacter--Fruitless attempt of the Emperor Henry against the\r\nFlorentines--The emigrants are restored to the city--The citizens place\r\nthemselves under the king of Naples for five years--War with Uguccione\r\ndella Faggiuola--The Florentines routed--Florence withdraws herself\r\nfrom subjection to King Robert, and expels the Count Novello--Lando\r\nd'Agobbio--His tyranny--His departure.\r\n\r\nThe legate being returned to Rome, and hearing of the new disturbance\r\nwhich had occurred, persuaded the pope that if he wished to unite the\r\nFlorentines, it would be necessary to have twelve of the first citizens\r\nappear before him, and having thus removed the principal causes of\r\ndisunion, he might easily put a stop to it. The pontiff took this\r\nadvice, and the citizens, among whom was Corso Donati, obeyed the\r\nsummons. These having left the city, the legate told the exiles that\r\nnow, when the city was deprived of her leaders, was the time for them\r\nto return. They, therefore, having assembled, came to Florence, and\r\nentering by a part of the wall not yet completed, proceeded to the\r\npiazza of St. Giovanni. It is worthy of remark, that those who, a short\r\ntime previously, when they came unarmed and begged to be restored to\r\ntheir country, had fought for their return, now, when they saw them in\r\narms and resolved to enter by force, took arms to oppose them (so much\r\nmore was the common good esteemed than private friendship), and being\r\njoined by the rest of the citizens, compelled them to return to the\r\nplaces whence they had come. They failed in their undertaking by having\r\nleft part of their force at Lastra, and by not having waited the arrival\r\nof Tolosetto Uberti, who had to come from Pistoia with three hundred\r\nhorse; for they thought celerity rather than numbers would give them the\r\nvictory; and it often happens, in similar enterprises, that delay robs\r\nus of the occasion, and too great anxiety to be forward prevents us of\r\nthe power, or makes us act before we are properly prepared.\r\n\r\nThe banished having retired, Florence again returned to her old\r\ndivisions; and in order to deprive the Cavalcanti of their authority,\r\nthe people took from them the Stinche, a castle situated in the Val\r\ndi Greve, and anciently belonging to the family. And as those who were\r\ntaken in it were the first who were put into the new prisons, the latter\r\nwere, and still continue, named after it,--the Stinche. The leaders of\r\nthe republic also re-established the companies of the people, and gave\r\nthem the ensigns that were first used by the companies of the Arts; the\r\nheads of which were called Gonfaloniers of the companies and colleagues\r\nof the Signory; and ordered, that when any disturbance arose they should\r\nassist the Signory with arms, and in peace with counsel. To the two\r\nancient rectors they added an executor, or sheriff, who, with the\r\nGonfaloniers, was to aid in repressing the insolence of the nobility.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the pope died. Corso, with the other citizens, returned\r\nfrom Rome; and all would have been well if his restless mind had not\r\noccasioned new troubles. It was his common practice to be of a contrary\r\nopinion to the most powerful men in the city; and whatever he saw the\r\npeople inclined to do, he exercised his utmost influence to effect,\r\nin order to attach them to himself; so that he was a leader in all\r\ndifferences, at the head of every new scheme, and whoever wished to\r\nobtain anything extraordinary had recourse to him. This conduct caused\r\nhim to be hated by many of the highest distinction; and their hatred\r\nincreased to such a degree that the Neri faction to which he belonged,\r\nbecame completely divided; for Corso, to attain his ends, had availed\r\nhimself of private force and authority, and of the enemies of the state.\r\nBut so great was the influence attached to his person, that everyone\r\nfeared him. Nevertheless, in order to strip him of the popular favor\r\n(which by this means may easily be done), a report was set on foot that\r\nhe intended to make himself prince of the city; and to the design his\r\nconduct gave great appearance of probability, for his way of living\r\nquite exceeded all civil bounds; and the opinion gained further\r\nstrength, upon his taking to wife a daughter of Uguccione della\r\nFaggiuola, head of the Ghibelline and Bianchi faction, and one of the\r\nmost powerful men in Tuscany.\r\n\r\nWhen this marriage became known it gave courage to his adversaries, and\r\nthey took arms against him; for the same reason the people ceased\r\nto defend him, and the greater part of them joined the ranks of his\r\nenemies, the leaders of whom were Rosso della Tosa, Pazino dei Pazzi,\r\nGeri Spini, and Berto Brunelleschi. These, with their followers, and the\r\ngreater part of the people, assembled before the palace of the Signory,\r\nby whose command a charge was made before Piero Branca, captain of the\r\npeople, against Corso, of intending, with the aid of Uguccione, to usurp\r\nthe government. He was then summoned, and for disobedience, declared\r\na rebel; nor did two hours pass over between the accusation and the\r\nsentence. The judgment being given, the Signory, with the companies of\r\nthe people under their ensigns, went in search of him, who, although\r\nseeing himself abandoned by many of his followers, aware of the sentence\r\nagainst him, the power of the Signory, and the multitude of his enemies,\r\nremained undaunted, and fortified his houses, in the hope of defending\r\nthem till Uguccione, for whom he had sent, should come to his Relief.\r\nHis residences, and the streets approaching them, were barricaded and\r\ntaken possession of by his partisans, who defended them so bravely that\r\nthe enemy, although in great numbers, could not force them, and the\r\nbattle became one of the hottest, with wounds and death on all sides.\r\nBut the people, finding they could not drive them from their ground,\r\ntook possession of the adjoining houses, and by unobserved passages\r\nobtained entry. Corso, thus finding himself surrounded by his foes, no\r\nlonger retaining any hope of assistance from Uguccione, and without a\r\nchance of victory, thought only of effecting his personal safety, and\r\nwith Gherardo Bordoni, and some of his bravest and most trusted friends,\r\nfought a passage through the thickest of their enemies, and effected\r\ntheir escape from the city by the Gate of the Cross. They were, however,\r\npursued by vast numbers, and Gherardo was slain upon the bridge of\r\nAffrico by Boccaccio Cavicciulli. Corso was overtaken and made\r\nprisoner by a party of Catalan horse, in the service of the Signory, at\r\nRovezzano. But when approaching Florence, that he might avoid being seen\r\nand torn to pieces by his victorious enemies, he allowed himself to fall\r\nfrom horseback, and being down, one of those who conducted him cut his\r\nthroat. The body was found by the monks of San Salvi, and buried without\r\nany ceremony due to his rank. Such was the end of Corso, to whom his\r\ncountry and the Neri faction were indebted for much both of good and\r\nevil; and if he had possessed a cooler spirit he would have left behind\r\nhim a more happy memory. Nevertheless, he deserves to be enumerated\r\namong the most distinguished men our city has produced. True it is, that\r\nhis restless conduct made both his country and his party forgetful of\r\ntheir obligation to him. The same cause also produced his miserable\r\nend, and brought many troubles upon both his friends and his country.\r\nUguccione, coming to the assistance of his relative, learned at Remoli\r\nthat Corso had been overcome by the people, and finding that he could\r\nnot render him any assistance, in order to avoid bringing evil upon\r\nhimself without occasion, he returned home.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Corso, which occurred in the year 1308, the\r\ndisturbances were appeased, and the people lived quietly till it was\r\nreported that the Emperor Henry was coming into Italy, and with him all\r\nthe Florentine emigrants, to whom he had promised restoration to their\r\ncountry. The leaders of the government thought, that in order to lessen\r\nthe number of their enemies, it would be well to recall, of their own\r\nwill, all who had been expelled, excepting such as the law had expressly\r\nforbidden to return. Of the number not admitted, were the greater part\r\nof the Ghibellines, and some of those of the Bianchi faction, among whom\r\nwere Dante Alighieri, the sons of Veri de' Cerchi and of Giano della\r\nBella. Besides this they sent for aid to Robert, king of Naples, and not\r\nbeing able to obtain it of him as friends, they gave their city to him\r\nfor five years, that he might defend them as his own people. The emperor\r\nentered Italy by the way of Pisa, and proceeded by the marshes to Rome,\r\nwhere he was crowned in the year 1312. Then, having determined to subdue\r\nthe Florentines, he approached their city by the way of Perugia and\r\nArezzo, and halted with his army at the monastery of San Salvi, about\r\na mile from Florence, where he remained fifty days without effecting\r\nanything. Despairing of success against Florence, he returned to Pisa,\r\nwhere he entered into an agreement with Frederick, king of Sicily,\r\nto undertake the conquest of Naples, and proceeded with his people\r\naccordingly; but while filled with the hope of victory, and carrying\r\ndismay into the heart of King Robert, having reached Buonconvento, he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Uguccione della Faggiuola, having by means of the\r\nGhibelline party become lord of Pisa and of Lucca, caused, with the\r\nassistance of these cities, very serious annoyance to the neighbouring\r\nplaces. In order to effect their relief the Florentines requested\r\nKing Robert would allow his brother Piero to take the command of their\r\narmies. On the other hand, Uguccione continued to increase his power;\r\nand either by force or fraud obtained possession of many castles in the\r\nVal d'Arno and the Val di Nievole; and having besieged Monte Cataini,\r\nthe Florentines found it would be necessary to send to its relief, that\r\nthey might not see him burn and destroy their whole territory. Having\r\ndrawn together a large army, they entered the Val di Nievole where they\r\ncame up with Uguccione, and were routed after a severe battle in which\r\nPiero the king's brother and 2,000 men were slain; but the body of\r\nthe Prince was never found. Neither was the victory a joyful one to\r\nUguccione; for one of his sons, and many of the leaders of his army,\r\nfell in the strife.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines after this defeat fortified their territory, and King\r\nRobert sent them, for commander of their forces, the Count d'Andria,\r\nusually called Count Novello, by whose deportment, or because it is\r\nnatural to the Florentines to find every state tedious, the city,\r\nnotwithstanding the war with Uguccione, became divided into friends and\r\nenemies of the king. Simon della Tosa, the Magalotti, and certain others\r\nof the people who had attained greater influence in the government than\r\nthe rest, were leaders of the party against the king. By these means\r\nmessengers were sent to France, and afterward into Germany, to solicit\r\nleaders and forces that they might drive out the count, whom the king\r\nhad appointed governor; but they failed of obtaining any. Nevertheless\r\nthey did not abandon their undertaking, but still desirous of one whom\r\nthey might worship, after an unavailing search in France and Germany,\r\nthey discovered him at Agobbio, and having expelled the Count Novello,\r\ncaused Lando d'Agobbio to be brought into the city as Bargello (sheriff),\r\nand gave him the most unlimited power of the citizens. This man was\r\ncruel and rapacious; and going through the country accompanied with an\r\narmed force, he put many to death at the mere instigation of those who\r\nhad endowed him with authority. His insolence rose to such a height,\r\nthat he stamped base metal with the impression used upon the money of\r\nthe state, and no one had sufficient courage to oppose him, so powerful\r\nhad he become by the discords of Florence. Great, certainly, but unhappy\r\ncity! which neither the memory of past divisions, the fear of her\r\nenemies, nor a king's authority, could unite for her own advantage; so\r\nthat she found herself in a state of the utmost wretchedness, harassed\r\nwithout by Uguccione, and plundered within by Lando d'Agobbio.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the king and those who opposed Lando and his followers,\r\nwere either of noble families or the highest of the people, and all\r\nGuelphs; but their adversaries being in power they could not discover\r\ntheir minds without incurring the greatest danger. Being, however,\r\ndetermined to deliver themselves from such disgraceful tyranny, they\r\nsecretly wrote to King Robert, requesting him to appoint for his vicar\r\nin Florence Count Guido da Battifolle. The king complied; and the\r\nopposite party, although the Signory were opposed to the king, on\r\naccount of the good quality of the count, did not dare to resist him.\r\nStill his authority was not great, because the Signory and Gonfaloniers\r\nof the companies were in favor of Lando and his party.\r\n\r\nDuring these troubles, the daughter of King Albert of Bohemia passed\r\nthrough Florence, in search of her husband, Charles, the son of King\r\nRobert, and was received with the greatest respect by the friends of the\r\nking, who complained to her of the unhappy state of the city, and of the\r\ntyranny of Lando and his partisans; so that through her influence and\r\nthe exertions of the king's friends, the citizens were again united, and\r\nbefore her departure, Lando was stripped of all authority and send back\r\nto Agobbio, laden with blood and plunder. In reforming the government,\r\nthe sovereignty of the city was continued to the king for another three\r\nyears, and as there were then in office seven Signors of the party\r\nof Lando, six more were appointed of the king's friends, and some\r\nmagistracies were composed of thirteen Signors; but not long afterward\r\nthe number was reduced to seven according to ancient custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nWar with Castruccio--Castruccio marches against Prato and retires\r\nwithout making any attempt--The emigrants not being allowed to return,\r\nendeavor to enter the city by force, and are repulsed--Change in\r\nthe mode of electing the great officers of state--The Squittini\r\nestablished--The Florentines under Raymond of Cardona are routed\r\nby Castruccio at Altopascio--Treacherous designs of Raymond--The\r\nFlorentines give the sovereignty of the city to Charles duke of Cambria,\r\nwho appoints the duke of Athens for his vicar--The duke of Calabria\r\ncomes to Florence--The Emperor Louis of Bavaria visits Italy--The\r\nexcitement he produces--Death of Castruccio and of Charles duke of\r\nCalabria--Reform of government.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, Uguccione lost the sovereignty of Lucca and of\r\nPisa, and Castruccio Castracani, a citizen of Lucca, became lord of\r\nthem, who, being a young man, bold and fierce, and fortunate in his\r\nenterprises, in a short time became the head of the Ghibellines in\r\nTuscany. On this account the discords among the Florentines were\r\nlaid aside for some years, at first to abate the increasing power\r\nof Castruccio, and afterward to unite their means for mutual defense\r\nagainst him. And in order to give increased strength and efficacy to\r\ntheir counsels, the Signory appointed twelve citizens whom they called\r\nBuonomini, or good men, without whose advice and consent nothing of\r\nany importance could be carried into effect. The conclusion of the\r\nsovereignty of King Robert being come, the citizens took the government\r\ninto their own hands, reappointed the usual rectors and magistracies,\r\nand were kept united by the dread of Castruccio, who, after many efforts\r\nagainst the lords of Lunigiano, attacked Prato, to the relief of which\r\nthe Florentines having resolved to go, shut up their shops and houses,\r\nand proceeded thither in a body, amounting to twenty thousand foot and\r\none thousand five hundred horse. And in order to reduce the number of\r\nCastruccio's friends and augment their own, the Signory declared that\r\nevery rebel of the Guelphic party who should come to the relief of Prato\r\nwould be restored to his country; they thus increased their army with an\r\naddition of four thousand men. This great force being quickly brought\r\nto Prato, alarmed Castruccio so much, that without trying the fortune\r\nof battle, he retired toward Lucca. Upon this, disturbances arose in the\r\nFlorentine camp between the nobility and the people, the latter of whom\r\nwished to pursue the foe and destroy him; the former were for returning\r\nhome, saying they had done enough for Prato in hazarding the safety\r\nof Florence on its account, which they did not regret under the\r\ncircumstances, but now, that necessity no longer existing, the propriety\r\nof further risk ceased also, as there was little to be gained and much\r\nto lose. Not being able to agree, the question was referred to the\r\nSignory, among whom the difference of opinion was equally great; and\r\nas the matter spread throughout the city, the people drew together, and\r\nused such threatening language against the nobility that they, being\r\napprehensive for their safety, yielded; but the resolution being adopted\r\ntoo late, and by many unwillingly, gave the enemy time to withdraw in\r\nsafety to Lucca.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate circumstance made the people so indignant against\r\nthe great that the Signory refused to perform the promise made to\r\nthe exiles, and the latter, anticipating the fact, determined to be\r\nbeforehand, and were at the gates of Florence to gain admittance into\r\nthe city before the rest of the forces; but their design did not take\r\neffect, for their purpose being foreseen, they were repulsed by those\r\nwho had remained at home. They then endeavored to acquire by entreaty\r\nwhat they had failed to obtain by force; and sent eight men as\r\nambassadors to the Signory, to remind them of the promise given, and\r\nof the dangers they had undergone, in hope of the reward which had been\r\nheld out to them. And although the nobility, who felt the obligation on\r\naccount of their having particularly undertaken to fulfill the promise\r\nfor which the Signory had bound themselves, used their utmost exertion\r\nin favor of the exiles, so great was the anger of the multitude on\r\naccount of their only partial success against Castruccio, that they\r\ncould not obtain their admission. This occasioned cost and dishonor to\r\nthe city; for many of the nobility, taking offense at this proceeding,\r\nendeavored to obtain by arms that which had been refused to their\r\nprayers, and agreed with the exiles that they should come armed to the\r\ncity, and that those within would arm themselves in their defense. But\r\nthe affair was discovered before the appointed day arrived, so that\r\nthose without found the city in arms, and prepared to resist them. So\r\ncompletely subdued were those within, that none dared to take arms; and\r\nthus the undertaking was abandoned, without any advantage having\r\nbeen obtained by the party. After the departure of the exiles it was\r\ndetermined to punish those who had been instrumental in bringing them\r\nto the city; but, although everyone knew who were the delinquents,\r\nnone ventured to name and still less to accuse them. It was, therefore,\r\nresolved that in order to come at the truth, everyone should write\r\nthe names of those he believed to be guilty, and present the writing\r\nsecretly to the Capitano. By this means, Amerigo Donati, Teghiajo,\r\nFrescobaldi, and Lotteringo Gherardini were accused; but, the judges\r\nbeing more favorably disposed to them than, perhaps, their misdeeds\r\ndeserved, each escaped by paying a fine.\r\n\r\nThe tumults which arose in Florence from the coming of the rebels to the\r\ngates, showed that one leader was insufficient for the companies of\r\nthe people; they, therefore, determined that in future each should have\r\nthree or four; and to every Gonfalonier two or three Pennonieri (pennon\r\nbearers) were added, so that if the whole body were not drawn out, a\r\npart might operate under one of them. And as happens in republics, after\r\nany disturbance, some old laws are annulled and others renewed, so\r\non this occasion, as it had been previously customary to appoint the\r\nSignory for a time only, the then existing Signors and the Colleagues,\r\nfeeling themselves possessed of sufficient power, assumed the authority\r\nto fix upon the Signors that would have to sit during the next forty\r\nmonths, by putting their names into a bag or purse, and drawing them\r\nevery two months. But, before the expiration of the forty months, many\r\ncitizens were jealous that their names had not been deposited among\r\nthe rest, and a new emborsation was made. From this beginning arose the\r\ncustom of emborsing or enclosing the names of all who should take office\r\nin any of the magistracies for a long time to come, as well those whose\r\noffices employed them within the city as those abroad, though previously\r\nthe councils of the retiring magistrates had elected those who were to\r\nsucceed them. These emborsations were afterward called Squittini, or\r\npollings,--and it was thought they would prevent much trouble to the\r\ncity, and remove the cause of those tumults which every three, or at\r\nmost five, years, took place upon the creation of magistrates, from the\r\nnumber of candidates for office. And not being able to adopt a better\r\nexpedient, they made use of this, but did not observe the defects which\r\nlay concealed under such a trivial accommodation.\r\n\r\nIn 1325, Castruccio, having taken possession of Pistoia, became so\r\npowerful that the Florentines, fearing his greatness, resolved, before\r\nhe should get himself firmly seated in his new conquest, to attack him\r\nand withdraw it from his authority. Of their citizens and friends they\r\nmustered an army amounting to 20,000 foot and 3,000 horse, and with this\r\nbody encamped before Altopascio, with the intention of taking the place\r\nand thus preventing it from relieving Pistoia. Being successful in the\r\nfirst part of their design, they marched toward Lucca, and laid the\r\ncountry waste in their progress; but from the little prudence and less\r\nintegrity of their leader, Ramondo di Cardona, they made but small\r\nprogress; for he, having observed them upon former occasions very\r\nprodigal of their liberty, placing it sometimes in the hands of a king,\r\nat others in those of a legate, or persons of even inferior quality,\r\nthought, if he could bring them into some difficulty, it might easily\r\nhappen that they would make him their prince. Nor did he fail frequently\r\nto mention these matters, and required to have that authority in the\r\ncity which had been given him over the army, endeavoring to show that\r\notherwise he could not enforce the obedience requisite to a leader. As\r\nthe Florentines did not consent to this, he wasted time, and allowed\r\nCastruccio to obtain the assistance which the Visconti and other tyrants\r\nof Lombardy had promised him, and thus become very strong. Ramondo,\r\nhaving willfully let the opportunity of victory pass away, now\r\nfound himself unable to escape; for Castruccio coming up with him at\r\nAltopascio, a great battle ensued in which many citizens were slain and\r\ntaken prisoners, and among the former fell Ramondo, who received from\r\nfortune that reward of bad faith and mischievous counsels which he had\r\nrichly deserved from the Florentines. The injury they suffered from\r\nCastruccio, after the battle, in plunder, prisoners, destruction,\r\nand burning of property, is quite indescribable; for, without any\r\nopposition, during many months, he led his predatory forces wherever he\r\nthought proper, and it seemed sufficient to the Florentines if, after\r\nsuch a terrible event, they could save their city.\r\n\r\nStill they were not so absolutely cast down as to prevent them from\r\nraising great sums of money, hiring troops, and sending to their friends\r\nfor assistance; but all they could do was insufficient to restrain such\r\na powerful enemy; so that they were obliged to offer the sovereignty to\r\nCharles duke of Calabria, son of King Robert, if they could induce him\r\nto come to their defense; for these princes, being accustomed to rule\r\nFlorence, preferred her obedience to her friendship. But Charles, being\r\nengaged in the wars of Sicily, and therefore unable to undertake the\r\nsovereignty of the city, sent in his stead Walter, by birth a Frenchman,\r\nand duke of Athens. He, as viceroy, took possession of the city, and\r\nappointed the magistracies according to his own pleasure; but his mode\r\nof proceeding was quite correct, and so completely contrary to his real\r\nnature, that everyone respected him.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Sicily being composed, Charles came to Florence with a\r\nthousand horse. He made his entry into the city in July, 1326, and\r\nhis coming prevented further pillage of the Florentine territory by\r\nCastruccio. However, the influence which they acquired without the city\r\nwas lost within her walls, and the evils which they did not suffer from\r\ntheir enemies were brought upon them by their friends; for the Signory\r\ncould not do anything without the consent of the duke of Calabria,\r\nwho, in the course of one year, drew from the people 400,000 florins,\r\nalthough by the agreement entered into with him, the sum was not to\r\nexceed 200,000; so great were the burdens with which either himself or\r\nhis father constantly oppressed them.\r\n\r\nTo these troubles were added new jealousies and new enemies; for the\r\nGhibellines of Lombardy became so alarmed upon the arrival of Charles in\r\nTuscany, that Galeazzo Visconti and the other Lombard tyrants, by money\r\nand promises, induced Louis of Bavaria, who had lately been elected\r\nemperor contrary to the wish of the pope, to come into Italy. After\r\npassing through Lombardy he entered Tuscany, and with the assistance\r\nof Castruccio, made himself master of Pisa, from whence, having been\r\npacified with sums of money, he directed his course towards Rome. This\r\ncaused the duke of Calabria to be apprehensive for the safety of Naples;\r\nhe therefore left Florence, and appointed as his viceroy Filippo da\r\nSaggineto.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the emperor, Castruccio made himself master of\r\nPisa, but the Florentines, by a treaty with Pistoia, withdrew her from\r\nobedience to him. Castruccio then besieged Pistoia, and persevered\r\nwith so much vigor and resolution, that although the Florentines often\r\nattempted to relieve her, by attacking first his army and then his\r\ncountry, they were unable either by force or policy to remove him; so\r\nanxious was he to punish the Pistolesi and subdue the Florentines. At\r\nlength the people of Pistoia were compelled to receive him for their\r\nsovereign; but this event, although greatly to his glory, proved but\r\nlittle to his advantage, for upon his return to Lucca he died. And as\r\none event either of good or evil seldom comes alone, at Naples also died\r\nCharles duke of Calabria and lord of Florence, so that in a short time,\r\nbeyond the expectation of their most sanguine hopes, the Florentines\r\nfound themselves delivered from the domination of the one and the fear\r\nof the other. Being again free, they set about the reformation of the\r\ncity, annulled all the old councils, and created two new ones, the one\r\ncomposed of 300 citizens from the class of the people, the other of 250\r\nfrom the nobility and the people.\r\n\r\nThe first was called the Council of the People, the other the Council of\r\nthe Commune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe Emperor at Rome--The Florentines refuse to purchase Lucca, and\r\nrepent of it--Enterprises of the Florentines--Conspiracy of the Bardi\r\nand the Frescobaldi--The conspiracy discovered and checked--Maffeo da\r\nMarradi appeases the tumult--Lucca is purchased by the Florentines\r\nand taken by the Pisans--The duke of Athens at Florence--The nobility\r\ndetermine to make him prince of the city.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, being arrived at Rome, created an anti-pope, did many\r\nthings in opposition to the church, and attempted many others, but\r\nwithout effect, so that at last he retired with disgrace, and went to\r\nPisa, where, either because they were not paid, or from disaffection,\r\nabout 800 German horse mutinied, and fortified themselves at Montechiaro\r\nupon the Ceruglio; and when the emperor had left Pisa to go into\r\nLombardy, they took possession of Lucca and drove out Francesco\r\nCastracani, whom he had left there. Designing to turn their conquest to\r\naccount, they offered it to the Florentines for 80,000 florins, which,\r\nby the advice of Simone della Tosa, was refused. This resolution, if\r\nthey had remained in it, would have been of the greatest utility to\r\nthe Florentines; but as they shortly afterward changed their minds,\r\nit became most pernicious; for although at the time they might have\r\nobtained peaceful possession of her for a small sum and would not,\r\nthey afterward wished to have her and could not, even for a much larger\r\namount; which caused many and most hurtful changes to take place in\r\nFlorence. Lucca, being refused by the Florentines, was purchased by\r\nGherardino Spinoli, a Genoese, for 30,000 florins. And as men are often\r\nless anxious to take what is in their power than desirous of that which\r\nthey cannot attain, as soon as the purchase of Gherardino became known,\r\nand for how small a sum it had been bought, the people of Florence were\r\nseized with an extreme desire to have it, blaming themselves and those\r\nby whose advice they had been induced to reject the offer made to them.\r\nAnd in order to obtain by force what they had refused to purchase, they\r\nsent troops to plunder and overrun the country of the Lucchese.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the emperor left Italy. The anti-pope, by means of the\r\nPisans, became a prisoner in France; and the Florentines from the death\r\nof Castruccio, which occurred in 1328, remained in domestic peace till\r\n1340, and gave their undivided attention to external affairs, while many\r\nwars were carried on in Lombardy, occasioned by the coming of John king\r\nof Bohemia, and in Tuscany, on account of Lucca. During this period\r\nFlorence was ornamented with many new buildings, and by the advice of\r\nGiotto, the most distinguished painter of his time, they built the tower\r\nof Santa Reparata. Besides this, the waters of the Arno having, in 1333,\r\nrisen twelve feet above their ordinary level, destroyed some of the\r\nbridges and many buildings, all which were restored with great care and\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1340, new sources of disagreement arose. The great had two\r\nways of increasing or preserving their power; the one, so to restrain\r\nthe emborsation of magistrates, that the lot always fell upon themselves\r\nor their friends; the other, that having the election of the rectors,\r\nthey were always favorable to their party. This second mode they\r\nconsidered of so great importance, that the ordinary rectors not being\r\nsufficient for them, they on some occasions elected a third, and at\r\nthis time they had made an extraordinary appointment, under the title\r\nof captain of the guard, of Jacopo Gabrielli of Agobbio, and endowed him\r\nwith unlimited authority over the citizens. This man, under the sanction\r\nof those who governed, committed constant outrages; and among those whom\r\nhe injured were Piero de' Bardi and Bardo Frescobaldi. These being of\r\nthe nobility, and naturally proud, could not endure that a stranger,\r\nsupported by a few powerful men, should without cause injure them with\r\nimpunity, and consequently entered into a conspiracy against him and\r\nthose by whom he was supported. They were joined by many noble families,\r\nand some of the people, who were offended with the tyranny of those in\r\npower. Their plan was, that each should bring into his house a number of\r\narmed men, and on the morning after the day of All Saints, when almost\r\nall would be in the temples praying for their dead, they should take\r\narms, kill the Capitano and those who were at the head of affairs, and\r\nthen, with a new Signory and new ordinances, reform the government.\r\n\r\nBut, as the more a dangerous business is considered, the less willingly\r\nit is undertaken, it commonly happens, when there is any time allowed\r\nbetween the determining upon a perilous enterprise and its execution,\r\nthat the conspiracy by one means or another becomes known. Andrea de'\r\nBardi was one of the conspirators, and upon reconsideration of the\r\nmatter, the fear of the punishment operated more powerfully upon him\r\nthan the desire of revenge, and he disclosed the affair to Jacopo\r\nAlberti, his brother-in-law. Jacopo acquainted the Priors, and they\r\ninformed the government. And as the danger was near, All Saints' day\r\nbeing just at hand, many citizens met together in the palace; and\r\nthinking their peril increased by delay, they insisted that the Signory\r\nshould order the alarm to be rung, and called the people together in\r\narms. Taldo Valori was at this time Gonfalonier, and Francesco Salviati\r\none of the Signory, who, being relatives of the Bardi, were unwilling to\r\nsummon the people with the bell, alleging as a reason that it is by\r\nno means well to assemble them in arms upon every slight occasion,\r\nfor power put into the hands of an unrestrained multitude was never\r\nbeneficial; that it is an easy matter to excite them to violence, but\r\na difficult thing to restrain them; and that, therefore, it would be\r\ntaking a more prudent course if they were to inquire into the truth of\r\nthe affair, and punish the delinquents by the civil authority, than to\r\nattempt, upon a simple information, to correct it by such a tumultuous\r\nmeans, and thus hazard the safety of the city. None would listen to\r\nthese remarks; the Signory were assailed with insolent behavior and\r\nindecent expressions, and compelled to sound the alarm, upon which the\r\npeople presently assembled in arms. On the other hand, the Bardi and the\r\nFrescobaldi, finding themselves discovered, that they might conquer\r\nwith glory or die without shame, armed themselves, in the hope that they\r\nwould be able to defend that part of the city beyond the river, where\r\ntheir houses were situated; and they fortified the bridge in expectation\r\nof assistance, which they expected from the nobles and their friends in\r\nthe country. Their design was frustrated by the people who, in common\r\nwith themselves, occupied this part of the city; for these took arms\r\nin favor of the Signory, so that, seeing themselves thus circumstanced,\r\nthey abandoned the bridges, and betook themselves to the street in which\r\nthe Bardi resided, as being a stronger situation than any other; and\r\nthis they defended with great bravery.\r\n\r\nJacopo d'Agobbio, knowing the whole conspiracy was directed against\r\nhimself, in fear of death, terrified and vanquished, kept himself\r\nsurrounded with forces near the palace of the Signory; but the other\r\nrectors, who were much less blamable, discovered greater courage, and\r\nespecially the podesta or provost, whose name was Maffeo da Marradi. He\r\npresented himself among the combatants without any fear, and passing the\r\nbridge of the Rubaconte amid the swords of the Bardi, made a sign that\r\nhe wished to speak to them. Upon this, their reverence for the man, his\r\nnoble demeanor, and the excellent qualities he was known to possess,\r\ncaused an immediate cessation of the combat, and induced them to listen\r\nto him patiently. He very gravely, but without the use of any bitter or\r\naggravating expressions, blamed their conspiracy, showed the danger they\r\nwould incur if they still contended against the popular feeling, gave\r\nthem reason to hope their complaints would be heard and mercifully\r\nconsidered, and promised that he himself would use his endeavors in\r\ntheir behalf. He then returned to the Signory, and implored them to\r\nspare the blood of the citizens, showing the impropriety of judging them\r\nunheard, and at length induced them to consent that the Bardi and the\r\nFrescobaldi, with their friends, should leave the city, and without\r\nimpediment be allowed to retire to their castles. Upon their departure\r\nthe people being again disarmed, the Signory proceeded against those\r\nonly of the Bardi and Frescobaldi families who had taken arms. To lessen\r\ntheir power, they bought of the Bardi the castle of Mangona and that\r\nof Vernia; and enacted a law which provided that no citizen should be\r\nallowed to possess a castle or fortified place within twenty miles of\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nAfter a few months, Stiatta Frescobaldi was beheaded, and many of his\r\nfamily banished. Those who governed, not satisfied with having subdued\r\nthe Bardi and the Frescobaldi, as is most commonly the case, the more\r\nauthority they possessed the worse use they made of it and the more\r\ninsolent they became. As they had hitherto had one captain of the guard\r\nwho afflicted the city, they now appointed another for the country, with\r\nunlimited authority, to the end that those whom they suspected might\r\nabide neither within nor without. And they excited them to such\r\nexcesses against the whole of the nobility, that these were driven to\r\ndesperation, and ready to sell both themselves and the city to obtain\r\nrevenge. The occasion at length came, and they did not fail to use it.\r\n\r\nThe troubles of Tuscany and Lombardy had brought the city of Lucca under\r\nthe rule of Mastino della Scala, lord of Verona, who, though bound by\r\ncontract to assign her to the Florentines, had refused to do so; for,\r\nbeing lord of Parma, he thought he should be able to retain her, and did\r\nnot trouble himself about his breach of faith. Upon this the Florentines\r\njoined the Venetians, and with their assistance brought Mastino to\r\nthe brink of ruin. They did not, however, derive any benefit from\r\nthis beyond the slight satisfaction of having conquered him; for the\r\nVenetians, like all who enter into league with less powerful states than\r\nthemselves, having acquired Trevigi and Vicenza, made peace with Mastino\r\nwithout the least regard for the Florentines. Shortly after this, the\r\nVisconti, lords of Milan, having taken Parma from Mastino, he found\r\nhimself unable to retain Lucca, and therefore determined to sell it. The\r\ncompetitors for the purchase were the Florentines and the Pisans; and in\r\nthe course of the treaty the Pisans, finding that the Florentines, being\r\nthe richer people, were about to obtain it, had recourse to arms,\r\nand, with the assistance of the Visconti, marched against Lucca. The\r\nFlorentines did not, on that account, withdraw from the purchase, but\r\nhaving agreed upon the terms with Mastino, paid part of the money,\r\ngave security for the remainder, and sent Naddo Rucellai, Giovanni\r\ndi Bernadino de' Medici, and Rosso di Ricciardo de' Ricci, to take\r\npossession, who entered Lucca by force, and Mastino's people delivered\r\nthe city to them. Nevertheless, the Pisans continued the siege, and the\r\nFlorentines used their utmost endeavors to relieve her; but after a long\r\nwar, loss of money, and accumulation of disgrace, they were compelled to\r\nretire, and the Pisans became lords of Lucca.\r\n\r\nThe loss of this city, as in like cases commonly happens, exasperated\r\nthe people of Florence against the members of the government; at every\r\nstreet corner and public place they were openly censured, and the entire\r\nmisfortune was laid to the charge of their greediness and mismanagement.\r\nAt the beginning of the war, twenty citizens had been appointed to\r\nundertake the direction of it, who appointed Malatesta da Rimini to\r\nthe command of the forces. He having exhibited little zeal and less\r\nprudence, they requested assistance from Robert king of Naples, and he\r\nsent them Walter duke of Athens, who, as Providence would have it,\r\nto bring about the approaching evils, arrived at Florence just at the\r\nmoment when the undertaking against Lucca had entirely failed. Upon this\r\nthe Twenty, seeing the anger of the people, thought to inspire them with\r\nfresh hopes by the appointment of a new leader, and thus remove, or at\r\nleast abate, the causes of calumny against themselves. As there was much\r\nto be feared, and that the duke of Athens might have greater authority\r\nto defend them, they first chose him for their coadjutor, and then\r\nappointed him to the command of the army. The nobility, who were\r\ndiscontented from the causes above mentioned, having many of them been\r\nacquainted with Walter, when upon a former occasion he had governed\r\nFlorence for the duke of Calabria, thought they had now an opportunity,\r\nthough with the ruin of the city, of subduing their enemies; for there\r\nwas no means of prevailing against those who had oppressed them but of\r\nsubmitting to the authority of a prince who, being acquainted with the\r\nworth of one party and the insolence of the other, would restrain the\r\nlatter and reward the former. To this they added a hope of the benefits\r\nthey might derive from him when he had acquired the principality by\r\ntheir means. They, therefore, took several occasions of being with him\r\nsecretly, and entreated he would take the command wholly upon himself,\r\noffering him the utmost assistance in their power. To their influence\r\nand entreaty were also added those of some families of the people; these\r\nwere the Peruzzi, Acciajuoli, Antellesi, and Buonaccorsi, who, being\r\noverwhelmed with debts, and without means of their own, wished for those\r\nof others to liquidate them, and, by the slavery of their country,\r\nto deliver themselves from their servitude to their creditors. These\r\ndemonstrations excited the ambitious mind of the duke to greater desire\r\nof dominion, and in order to gain himself the reputation of strict\r\nequity and justice, and thus increase his favor with the plebeians, he\r\nprosecuted those who had conducted the war against Lucca, condemned many\r\nto pay fines, others to exile, and put to death Giovanni de' Medici,\r\nNaddo Rucellai, and Guglielmo Altoviti.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Athens requires to be made prince of Florence--The Signory\r\naddress the duke upon the subject--The plebeians proclaim him prince\r\nof Florence for life--Tyrannical proceedings of the duke--The city\r\ndisgusted with him--Conspiracies against the duke--The duke discovers\r\nthe conspiracies, and becomes terrified--The city rises against him--He\r\nis besieged in the palace--Measures adopted by the citizens for\r\nreform of the government--The duke is compelled to withdraw from the\r\ncity--Miserable deaths of Guglielmo da Scesi and his son--Departure of\r\nthe duke of Athens--His character.\r\n\r\nThese executions greatly terrified the middle class of citizens, but\r\ngave satisfaction to the great and to the plebeians;--to the latter,\r\nbecause it is their nature to delight in evil; and to the former, by\r\nthus seeing themselves avenged of the many wrongs they had suffered from\r\nthe people. When the duke passed along the streets he was hailed with\r\nloud cheers, the boldness of his proceedings was praised, and both\r\nparties joined in open entreaties that he would search out the faults of\r\nthe citizens, and punish them.\r\n\r\nThe office of the Twenty began to fall into disuse, while the power\r\nof the duke became great, and the influence of fear excessive; so that\r\neveryone, in order to appear friendly to him, caused his arms to be\r\npainted over their houses, and the name alone was all he needed to be\r\nabsolutely prince. Thinking himself upon such a footing that he might\r\nsafely attempt anything, he gave the Signory to understand that he\r\njudged it necessary for the good of the city, that the sovereignty\r\nshould be freely given to him, and that as the rest of the citizens were\r\nwilling that it should be so, he desired they would also consent. The\r\nSignory, notwithstanding many had foreseen the ruin of their country,\r\nwere much disturbed at this demand; and although they were aware of the\r\ndangerous position in which they stood, that they might not be wanting\r\nin their duty, resolutely refused to comply. The duke had, in order to\r\nassume a greater appearance of religion and humanity, chosen for his\r\nresidence the convent of the Minor Canons of St. Croce, and in order\r\nto carry his evil designs into effect, proclaimed that all the people\r\nshould, on the following morning, present themselves before him in the\r\npiazza of the convent. This command alarmed the Signory much more than\r\nhis discourse to them had done, and they consulted with those citizens\r\nwhom they thought most attached to their country and to liberty; but\r\nthey could not devise any better plan, knowing the power of which the\r\nduke was possessed, than to endeavor by entreaty to induce him either to\r\nforego his design or to make his government less intolerable. A party of\r\nthem was, therefore, appointed to wait upon him, one of whom addressed\r\nhim in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n\"We appear before you, my lord, induced first by the demand which you\r\nhave made, and then by the orders you have given for a meeting of the\r\npeople; for it appears to us very clearly, that it is your intention\r\nto effect by extraordinary means the design from which we have hitherto\r\nwithheld our consent. It is not, however, our intention to oppose you\r\nwith force, but only to show what a heavy charge you take upon yourself,\r\nand the dangerous course you adopt; to the end that you may remember our\r\nadvice and that of those who, not by consideration of what is beneficial\r\nfor you, but for the gratification of their own unreasonable wishes,\r\nhave advised you differently. You are endeavoring to reduce to slavery a\r\ncity that has always existed in freedom; for the authority which we\r\nhave at times conceded to the kings of Naples was companionship and\r\nnot servitude. Have you considered the mighty things which the name\r\nof liberty implies to such a city as this, and how delightful it is to\r\nthose who hear it? It has a power which nothing can subdue, time cannot\r\nwear away, nor can any degree of merit in a prince countervail the loss\r\nof it. Consider, my lord, how great the force must be that can keep a\r\ncity like this in subjection, no foreign aid would enable you to do it;\r\nneither can you confide in those at home; for they who are at present\r\nyour friends, and advise you to adopt the course you now pursue, as soon\r\nas with your assistance they have overcome their enemies, will at once\r\nturn their thoughts toward effecting your destruction, and then take\r\nthe government upon themselves. The plebeians, in whom you confide, will\r\nchange upon any accident, however trivial; so that in a very short time\r\nyou may expect to see the whole city opposed to you, which will produce\r\nboth their ruin and your own. Nor will you be able to find any remedy\r\nfor this; for princes who have but few enemies may make their government\r\nvery secure by the death or banishment of those who are opposed to them;\r\nbut when the hatred is universal, no security whatever can be found, for\r\nyou cannot tell from what direction the evil may commence; and he who\r\nhas to apprehend every man his enemy cannot make himself assured of\r\nanyone. And if you should attempt to secure a friend or two, you would\r\nonly increase the dangers of your situation; for the hatred of the\r\nrest would be increased by your success, and they would become more\r\nresolutely disposed to vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"That time can neither destroy nor abate the desire for freedom is most\r\ncertain; for it has been often observed, that those have reassumed their\r\nliberty who in their own persons had never tasted of its charms, and\r\nlove it only from remembrance of what they have heard their fathers\r\nrelate; and, therefore, when recovered, have preserved it with\r\nindomitable resolution and at every hazard. And even when their\r\nfathers could not remember it, the public buildings, the halls of the\r\nmagistracy, and the insignia of free institutions, remind them of it;\r\nand these things cannot fail to be known and greatly desired by every\r\nclass of citizens.\r\n\r\n\"What is it you imagine you can do, that would be an equivalent for\r\nthe sweets of liberty, or make men lose the desire of their present\r\nconditions? No; if you were to join the whole of Tuscany to the\r\nFlorentine rule, if you were to return to the city daily in triumph\r\nover her enemies, what could it avail? The glory would not be ours,\r\nbut yours. We should not acquire fellow-citizens, but partakers of our\r\nbondage, who would serve to sink us still deeper in ignominy. And if\r\nyour conduct were in every respect upright, your demeanor amiable, and\r\nyour judgments equitable, all these would be insufficient to make you\r\nbeloved. If you imagine otherwise, you deceive yourself; for, to one\r\naccustomed to the enjoyment of liberty, the slightest chains feel\r\nheavy, and every tie upon his free soul oppresses him. Besides, it is\r\nimpossible to find a violent people associated with a good prince, for\r\nof necessity they must soon become alike, or their difference produce\r\nthe ruin of one of them. You may, therefore, be assured, that you\r\nwill either have to hold this city by force, to effect which, guards,\r\ncastles, and external aid have oft been found insufficient, or be\r\ncontent with the authority we have conferred; and this we would advise,\r\nreminding you that no dominion can be durable to which the governed do\r\nnot consent; and we have no wish to lead you, blinded by ambition, to\r\nsuch a point that, unable either to stand or advance, you must, to the\r\ngreat injury of both, of necessity fall.\"\r\n\r\nThis discourse did not in the slightest degree soften the obdurate mind\r\nof the duke, who replied that it was not his intention to rob the city\r\nof her liberty, but to restore it to her; for those cities alone are in\r\nslavery that are disunited, while the united are free. As Florence, by\r\nher factions and ambition, had deprived herself of liberty, he should\r\nrestore, not take it from her; and as he had been induced to take this\r\ncharge upon himself, not from his own ambition, but at the entreaty of\r\na great number of citizens, they would do well to be satisfied with that\r\nwhich produced contentment among the rest. With regard to the danger he\r\nmight incur, he thought nothing of it; for it was not the part of a good\r\nman to avoid doing good from his apprehension of evil, and it was the\r\npart of a coward to shun a glorious undertaking because some uncertainty\r\nattended the success of the attempt; and he knew he should so\r\nconduct himself, that they would soon see they had entertained great\r\napprehensions and been in little danger.\r\n\r\nThe Signory then agreed, finding they could not do better, that on the\r\nfollowing morning the people should be assembled in their accustomed\r\nplace of meeting, and with their consent the Signory should confer\r\nupon the duke the sovereignty of the city for one year, on the same\r\nconditions as it had been intrusted to the duke of Calabria. It was upon\r\nthe 8th of November, 1342, when the duke, accompanied by Giovanni della\r\nTosa and all his confederates, with many other citizens, came to the\r\npiazza or court of the palace, and having, with the Signory mounted upon\r\nthe ringhiera, or rostrum (as the Florentines call those steps which\r\nlead to the palace), the agreement which had been entered into between\r\nthe Signory and himself was read. When they had come to the passage\r\nwhich gave the government to him for one year, the people shouted, \"FOR\r\nLIFE.\" Upon this, Francesco Rustichelli, one of the Signory, arose to\r\nspeak, and endeavored to abate the tumult and procure a hearing; but the\r\nmob, with their hootings, prevented him from being heard by anyone; so\r\nthat with the consent of the people the duke was elected, not for one\r\nyear merely, but for life. He was then borne through the piazza by the\r\ncrowd, shouting his name as they proceeded.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom that he who is appointed to the guard of the palace\r\nshall, in the absence of the Signory, remain locked within. This office\r\nwas at that time held by Rinieri di Giotto, who, bribed by the friends\r\nof the duke, without waiting for any force, admitted him immediately.\r\nThe Signory, terrified and dishonored, retired to their own houses; the\r\npalace was plundered by the followers of the duke, the Gonfalon of the\r\npeople torn to pieces, and the arms of the duke placed over the palace.\r\nAll this happened to the indescribable sorrow of good men, though to\r\nthe satisfaction of those who, either from ignorance or malignity, were\r\nconsenting parties.\r\n\r\nThe duke, having acquired the sovereignty of the city, in order to strip\r\nthose of all authority who had been defenders of her liberty, forbade\r\nthe Signory to assemble in the palace, and appointed a private dwelling\r\nfor their use. He took their colors from the Gonfaloniers of the\r\ncompanies of the people; abolished the ordinances made for the restraint\r\nof the great; set at liberty those who were imprisoned; recalled the\r\nBardi and the Frescobaldi from exile, and forbade everyone from carrying\r\narms about his person. In order the better to defend himself against\r\nthose within the city, he made friends of all he could around it, and\r\ntherefore conferred great benefits upon the Aretini and other subjects\r\nof the Florentines. He made peace with the Pisans, although raised to\r\npower in order that he might carry on war against them; ceased paying\r\ninterest to those merchants who, during the war against Lucca, had lent\r\nmoney to the republic; increased the old taxes, levied new ones, and\r\ntook from the Signory all authority. His rectors were Baglione da\r\nPerugia and Guglielmo da Scesi, who, with Cerrettieri Bisdomini,\r\nwere the persons with whom he consulted on public affairs. He imposed\r\nburdensome taxes upon the citizens; his decisions between contending\r\nparties were unjust; and that precision and humanity which he had at\r\nfirst assumed, became cruelty and pride; so that many of the greatest\r\ncitizens and noblest people were, either by fines, death, or some new\r\ninvention, grievously oppressed. And in completing the same bad system,\r\nboth without the city and within, he appointed six rectors for the\r\ncountry, who beat and plundered the inhabitants. He suspected the great,\r\nalthough he had been benefited by them, and had restored many to their\r\ncountry; for he felt assured that the generous minds of the nobility\r\nwould not allow them, from any motives, to submit contentedly to his\r\nauthority. He also began to confer benefits and advantages upon the\r\nlowest orders, thinking that with their assistance, and the arms of\r\nforeigners, he would be able to preserve the tyranny. The month of May,\r\nduring which feasts are held, being come, he caused many companies to\r\nbe formed of the plebeians and very lowest of the people, and to these,\r\ndignified with splendid titles, he gave colors and money; and while\r\none party went in bacchanalian procession through the city, others were\r\nstationed in different parts of it, to receive them as guests. As the\r\nreport of the duke's authority spread abroad, many of French origin came\r\nto him, for all of whom he found offices and emoluments, as if they\r\nhad been the most trustworthy of men; so that in a short time Florence\r\nbecame not only subject to French dominion, but adopted their dress\r\nand manners; for men and women, without regard to propriety or sense\r\nof shame, imitated them. But that which disgusted the people most\r\ncompletely was the violence which, without any distinction of quality or\r\nrank, he and his followers committed upon the women.\r\n\r\nThe people were filled with indignation, seeing the majesty of the state\r\noverturned, its ordinances annihilated, its laws annulled, and every\r\ndecent regulation set at naught; for men unaccustomed to royal pomp\r\ncould not endure to see this man surrounded with his armed satellites on\r\nfoot and on horseback; and having now a closer view of their disgrace,\r\nthey were compelled to honor him whom they in the highest degree\r\nhated. To this hatred, was added the terror occasioned by the continual\r\nimposition of new taxes and frequent shedding of blood, with which he\r\nimpoverished and consumed the city.\r\n\r\nThe duke was not unaware of these impressions existing strongly in the\r\npeople's minds, nor was he without fear of the consequences; but still\r\npretended to think himself beloved; and when Matteo di Morozzo, either\r\nto acquire his favor or to free himself from danger, gave information\r\nthat the family of the Medici and some others had entered into a\r\nconspiracy against him he not only did not inquire into the matter, but\r\ncaused the informer to be put to a cruel death. This mode of proceeding\r\nrestrained those who were disposed to acquaint him of his danger and\r\ngave additional courage to such as sought his ruin. Bertone Cini, having\r\nventured to speak against the taxes with which the people were loaded,\r\nhad his tongue cut out with such barbarous cruelty as to cause his\r\ndeath. This shocking act increased the people's rage, and their hatred\r\nof the duke; for those who were accustomed to discourse and to act upon\r\nevery occasion with the greatest boldness, could not endure to live with\r\ntheir hands tied and forbidden to speak.\r\n\r\nThis oppression increased to such a degree, that not merely the\r\nFlorentines, who though unable to preserve their liberty cannot endure\r\nslavery, but the most servile people on earth would have been roused to\r\nattempt the recovery of freedom; and consequently many citizens of all\r\nranks resolved either to deliver themselves from this odious tyranny or\r\ndie in the attempt. Three distinct conspiracies were formed; one of the\r\ngreat; another of the people, and the third of the working classes; each\r\nof which, besides the general causes which operated upon the whole, were\r\nexcited by some other particular grievance. The great found themselves\r\ndeprived of all participation in the government; the people had lost the\r\npower they possessed, and the artificers saw themselves deficient in the\r\nusual remuneration of their labor.\r\n\r\nAgnolo Acciajuoli was at this time archbishop of Florence, and by his\r\ndiscourses had formerly greatly favored the duke, and procured him many\r\nfollowers among the higher class of the people. But when he found him\r\nlord of the city, and became acquainted with his tyrannical mode of\r\nproceeding, it appeared to him that he had misled his countrymen; and to\r\ncorrect the evil he had done, he saw no other course, but to attempt the\r\ncure by the means which had caused it. He therefore became the leader\r\nof the first and most powerful conspiracy, and was joined by the Bardi,\r\nRossi, Frescobaldi, Scali Altoviti, Magalotti, Strozzi, and Mancini. Of\r\nthe second, the principals were Manno and Corso Donati, and with them\r\nthe Pazzi, Cavicciulli, Cerchi, and Albizzi. Of the third the first\r\nwas Antonio Adimari, and with him the Medici, Bordini, Rucellai, and\r\nAldobrandini. It was the intention of these last, to slay him in the\r\nhouse of the Albizzi, whither he was expected to go on St. John's day,\r\nto see the horses run, but he not having gone, their design did not\r\nsucceed. They then resolved to attack him as he rode through the\r\ncity; but they found this would be very difficult; for he was always\r\naccompanied with a considerable armed force, and never took the same\r\nroad twice together, so that they had no certainty of where to find him.\r\nThey had a design of slaying him in the council, although they knew that\r\nif he were dead, they would be at the mercy of his followers.\r\n\r\nWhile these matters were being considered by the conspirators, Antonio\r\nAdimari, in expectation of getting assistance from them, disclosed\r\nthe affair to some Siennese, his friends, naming certain of the\r\nconspirators, and assuring them that the whole city was ready to rise at\r\nonce. One of them communicated the matter to Francesco Brunelleschi,\r\nnot with a design to injure the plot, but in the hope that he would join\r\nthem. Francesco, either from personal fear, or private hatred of some\r\none, revealed the whole to the duke; whereupon, Pagolo del Mazecha and\r\nSimon da Monterappoli were taken, who acquainted him with the number and\r\nquality of the conspirators. This terrified him, and he was advised to\r\nrequest their presence rather than to take them prisoners, for if they\r\nfled, he might without disgrace, secure himself by banishment of the\r\nrest. He therefore sent for Antonio Adimari, who, confiding in\r\nhis companions, appeared immediately, and was detained. Francesco\r\nBrunelleschi and Uguccione Buondelmonti advised the duke to take as many\r\nof the conspirators prisoners as he could, and put them to death;\r\nbut he, thinking his strength unequal to his foes, did not adopt this\r\ncourse, but took another, which, had it succeeded, would have freed him\r\nfrom his enemies and increased his power. It was the custom of the duke\r\nto call the citizens together upon some occasions and advise with them.\r\nHe therefore having first sent to collect forces from without, made\r\na list of three hundred citizens, and gave it to his messengers, with\r\norders to assemble them under the pretense of public business; and\r\nhaving drawn them together, it was his intention either to put them to\r\ndeath or imprison them.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Antonio Adimari and the sending for forces, which could\r\nnot be kept secret, alarmed the citizens, and more particularly those\r\nwho were in the plot, so that the boldest of them refused to attend, and\r\nas each had read the list, they sought each other, and resolved to rise\r\nat once and die like men, with arms in their hands, rather than be\r\nled like calves to the slaughter. In a very short time the chief\r\nconspirators became known to each other, and resolved that the next day,\r\nwhich was the 26th July, 1343, they would raise a disturbance in the Old\r\nMarket place, then arm themselves and call the people to freedom.\r\n\r\nThe next morning being come, at nine o'clock, according to agreement,\r\nthey took arms, and at the call of liberty assembled, each party in its\r\nown district, under the ensigns and with the arms of the people,\r\nwhich had been secretly provided by the conspirators. All the heads of\r\nfamilies, as well of the nobility as of the people, met together, and\r\nswore to stand in each other's defense, and effect the death of the\r\nduke; except some of the Buondelmonti and of the Cavalcanti, with those\r\nfour families of the people which had taken so conspicuous a part in\r\nmaking him sovereign, and the butchers, with others, the lowest of the\r\nplebeians, who met armed in the piazza in his favor.\r\n\r\nThe duke immediately fortified the place, and ordered those of his\r\npeople who were lodged in different parts of the city to mount upon\r\nhorseback and join those in the court; but, on their way thither, many\r\nwere attacked and slain. However, about three hundred horse assembled,\r\nand the duke was in doubt whether he should come forth and meet\r\nthe enemy, or defend himself within. On the other hand, the Medici,\r\nCavicciulli, Rucellai, and other families who had been most injured by\r\nhim, fearful that if he came forth, many of those who had taken arms\r\nagainst him would discover themselves his partisans, in order to deprive\r\nhim of the occasion of attacking them and increasing the number of\r\nhis friends, took the lead and assailed the palace. Upon this, those\r\nfamilies of the people who had declared for the duke, seeing themselves\r\nboldly attacked, changed their minds, and all took part with the\r\ncitizens, except Uguccione Buondelmonti, who retired into the palace,\r\nand Giannozzo Cavalcanti, who having withdrawn with some of his\r\nfollowers to the new market, mounted upon a bench, and begged that those\r\nwho were going in arms to the piazza, would take the part of the duke.\r\nIn order to terrify them, he exaggerated the number of his people and\r\nthreatened all with death who should obstinately persevere in their\r\nundertaking against their sovereign. But not finding any one either\r\nto follow him, or to chastise his insolence, and seeing his labor\r\nfruitless, he withdrew to his own house.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the contest in the piazza between the people and the\r\nforces of the duke was very great; but although the place served them\r\nfor defense, they were overcome, some yielding to the enemy, and others,\r\nquitting their horses, fled within the walls. While this was going on,\r\nCorso and Amerigo Donati, with a part of the people, broke open the\r\nstinche, or prisons; burnt the papers of the provost and of the public\r\nchamber; pillaged the houses of the rectors, and slew all who had held\r\noffices under the duke whom they could find. The duke, finding the\r\npiazza in possession of his enemies, the city opposed to him, and\r\nwithout any hope of assistance, endeavored by an act of clemency to\r\nrecover the favor of the people. Having caused those whom he had made\r\nprisoners to be brought before him, with amiable and kindly expressions\r\nhe set them at liberty, and made Antonio Adimari a knight, although\r\nquite against his will. He caused his own arms to be taken down, and\r\nthose of the people to be replaced over the palace; but these things\r\ncoming out of season, and forced by his necessities, did him little\r\ngood. He remained, notwithstanding all he did, besieged in the palace,\r\nand saw that having aimed at too much he had lost all, and would most\r\nlikely, after a few days, die either of hunger, or by the weapons of his\r\nenemies. The citizens assembled in the church of Santa Reparata, to\r\nform the new government, and appointed fourteen citizens, half from\r\nthe nobility and half from the people, who, with the archbishop, were\r\ninvested with full authority to remodel the state of Florence. They also\r\nelected six others to take upon them the duties of provost, till he who\r\nshould be finally chosen took office, the duties of which were usually\r\nperformed by a subject of some neighboring state.\r\n\r\nMany had come to Florence in defense of the people; among whom were a\r\nparty from Sienna, with six ambassadors, men of high consideration in\r\ntheir own country. These endeavored to bring the people and the duke\r\nto terms; but the former refused to listen to any whatever, unless\r\nGuglielmo da Scesi and his son, with Cerrettieri Bisdomini, were\r\nfirst given up to them. The duke would not consent to this; but being\r\nthreatened by those who were shut up with him, he was forced to comply.\r\nThe rage of men is certainly always found greater, and their revenge\r\nmore furious upon the recovery of liberty, than when it has only been\r\ndefended. Guglielmo and his son were placed among the thousands of their\r\nenemies, and the latter was not yet eighteen years old; neither his\r\nbeauty, his innocence, nor his youth, could save him from the fury of\r\nthe multitude; but both were instantly slain. Those who could not wound\r\nthem while alive, wounded them after they were dead; and not satisfied\r\nwith tearing them to pieces, they hewed their bodies with swords, tore\r\nthem with their hands, and even with their teeth. And that every sense\r\nmight be satiated with vengeance, having first heard their moans, seen\r\ntheir wounds, and touched their lacerated bodies, they wished even the\r\nstomach to be satisfied, that having glutted the external senses, the\r\none within might also have its share. This rabid fury, however hurtful\r\nto the father and son, was favorable to Cerrettieri; for the multitude,\r\nwearied with their cruelty toward the former, quite forgot him, so that\r\nhe, not being asked for, remained in the palace, and during night was\r\nconveyed safely away by his friends.\r\n\r\nThe rage of the multitude being appeased by their blood, an agreement\r\nwas made that the duke and his people, with whatever belonged to him,\r\nshould quit the city in safety; that he should renounce all claim, of\r\nwhatever kind, upon Florence, and that upon his arrival in the Casentino\r\nhe should ratify his renunciation. On the sixth of August he set out,\r\naccompanied by many citizens, and having arrived at the Casentino he\r\nratified the agreement, although unwillingly, and would not have kept\r\nhis word if Count Simon had not threatened to take him back to Florence.\r\nThis duke, as his proceedings testified, was cruel and avaricious,\r\ndifficult to speak with, and haughty in reply. He desired the service of\r\nmen, not the cultivation of their better feelings, and strove rather\r\nto inspire them with fear than love. Nor was his person less despicable\r\nthan his manners; he was short, his complexion was black, and he had a\r\nlong, thin beard. He was thus in every respect contemptible; and at the\r\nend of ten months, his misconduct deprived him of the sovereignty which\r\nthe evil counsel of others had given him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMany cities and territories, subject to the Florentines, rebel--Prudent\r\nconduct adopted upon this occasion--The city is divided into\r\nquarters--Disputes between the nobility and the people--The bishop\r\nendeavors to reconcile them, but does not succeed--The government\r\nreformed by the people--Riot of Andrea Strozzi--Serious disagreements\r\nbetween the nobility and the people--They come to arms, and the nobility\r\nare subdued--The plague in Florence of which Boccaccio speaks.\r\n\r\nThese events taking place in the city, induced all the dependencies\r\nof the Florentine state to throw off their yoke; so that Arezzo,\r\nCastiglione, Pistoia, Volterra, Colle, and San Gemigniano rebelled. Thus\r\nFlorence found herself deprived of both her tyrant and her dominions at\r\nthe same moment, and in recovering her liberty, taught her subjects\r\nhow they might become free. The duke being expelled and the territories\r\nlost, the fourteen citizens and the bishop thought it would be better to\r\nact kindly toward their subjects in peace, than to make them enemies by\r\nwar, and to show a desire that their subjects should be free as well as\r\nthemselves. They therefore sent ambassadors to the people of Arezzo, to\r\nrenounce all dominion over that city, and to enter into a treaty with\r\nthem; to the end that as they could not retain them as subjects, they\r\nmight make use of them as friends. They also, in the best manner they\r\nwere able, agreed with the other places that they should retain their\r\nfreedom, and that, being free, they might mutually assist each other in\r\nthe preservation of their liberties. This prudent course was attended\r\nwith a most favorable result; for Arezzo, not many years afterward,\r\nreturned to the Florentine rule, and the other places, in the course\r\nof a few months, returned to their former obedience. Thus it frequently\r\noccurs that we sooner attain our ends by a seeming indifferent to them,\r\nthan by more obstinate pursuit.\r\n\r\nHaving settled external affairs, they now turned to the consideration of\r\nthose within the city; and after some altercation between the nobility\r\nand the people, it was arranged that the nobility should form one-third\r\nof the Signory and fill one-half of the other offices. The city was, as\r\nwe have before shown, divided into sixths; and hence there would be six\r\nsignors, one for each sixth, except when, from some more than ordinary\r\ncause, there had been twelve or thirteen created; but when this had\r\noccurred they were again soon reduced to six. It now seemed desirable to\r\nmake an alteration in this respect, as well because the sixths were\r\nnot properly divided, as that, wishing to give their proportion to\r\nthe great, it became desirable to increase the number. They therefore\r\ndivided the city into quarters, and for each created three signors.\r\nThey abolished the office of Gonfalonier of Justice, and also the\r\nGonfaloniers of the companies of the people; and instead of the twelve\r\nBuonuomini, or good men, created eight counsellors, four from each\r\nparty. The government having been established in this manner, the city\r\nmight have been in repose if the great had been content to live in that\r\nmoderation which civil society requires. But they produced a contrary\r\nresult, for those out of office would not conduct themselves as\r\ncitizens, and those who were in government wished to be lords, so that\r\nevery day furnished some new instance of their insolence and pride.\r\nThese things were very grievous to the people, and they began to regret\r\nthat for one tyrant put down, there had sprung up a thousand. The\r\narrogance of one party and the anger of the other rose to such a degree,\r\nthat the heads of the people complained to the bishop of the improper\r\nconduct of the nobility, and what unfit associates they had become for\r\nthe people; and begged he would endeavor to induce them to be content\r\nwith their share of administration in the other offices, and leave the\r\nmagistracy of the Signory wholly to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe bishop was naturally a well-meaning man, but his want of firmness\r\nrendered him easily influenced. Hence, at the instance of his\r\nassociates, he at first favored the duke of Athens, and afterward, by\r\nthe advice of other citizens, conspired against him. At the reformation\r\nof the government, he had favored the nobility, and now he appeared to\r\nincline toward the people, moved by the reasons which they had\r\nadvanced. Thinking to find in others the same instability of purpose, he\r\nendeavored to effect an amicable arrangement. With this design he called\r\ntogether the fourteen who were yet in office, and in the best terms\r\nhe could imagine advised them to give up the Signory to the people, in\r\norder to secure the peace of the city; and assured them that if they\r\nrefused, ruin would most probably be the result.\r\n\r\nThis discourse excited the anger of the nobility to the highest pitch,\r\nand Ridolfo de' Bardi reproved him in unmeasured terms as a man of\r\nlittle faith; reminding him of his friendship for the duke, to prove the\r\nduplicity of his present conduct, and saying, that in driving him away\r\nhe had acted the part of a traitor. He concluded by telling him, that\r\nthe honors they had acquired at their own peril, they would at their own\r\nperil defend. They then left the bishop, and in great wrath, informed\r\ntheir associates in the government, and all the families of the\r\nnobility, of what had been done. The people also expressed their\r\nthoughts to each other, and as the nobility made preparations for the\r\ndefense of their signors, they determined not to wait till they had\r\nperfected their arrangements; and therefore, being armed, hastened to\r\nthe palace, shouting, as they went along, that the nobility must give up\r\ntheir share in the government.\r\n\r\nThe uproar and excitement were astonishing. The Signors of the nobility\r\nfound themselves abandoned; for their friends, seeing all the people in\r\narms, did not dare to rise in their defense, but each kept within his\r\nown house. The Signors of the people endeavored to abate the excitement\r\nof the multitude, by affirming their associates to be good and moderate\r\nmen; but, not succeeding in their attempt, to avoid a greater evil, sent\r\nthem home to their houses, whither they were with difficulty conducted.\r\nThe nobility having left the palace, the office of the four councillors\r\nwas taken from their party, and conferred upon twelve of the people. To\r\nthe eight signors who remained, a Gonfalonier of Justice was added, and\r\nsixteen Gonfaloniers of the companies of the people; and the council\r\nwas so reformed, that the government remained wholly in the hands of the\r\npopular party.\r\n\r\nAt the time these events took place there was a great scarcity in the\r\ncity, and discontent prevailed both among the highest and the lowest\r\nclasses; in the latter for want of food, and in the former from having\r\nlost their power in the state. This circumstance induced Andrea Strozzi\r\nto think of making himself sovereign of the city. Selling his corn at a\r\nlower price than others did, a great many people flocked to his house;\r\nemboldened by the sight of these, he one morning mounted his horse, and,\r\nfollowed by a considerable number, called the people to arms, and in a\r\nshort time drew together about 4,000 men, with whom he proceeded to the\r\nSignory, and demanded that the gates of the palace should be opened. But\r\nthe signors, by threats and the force which they retained in the palace,\r\ndrove them from the court; and then by proclamation so terrified them,\r\nthat they gradually dropped off and returned to their homes, and Andrea,\r\nfinding himself alone, with some difficulty escaped falling into the\r\nhands of the magistrates.\r\n\r\nThis event, although an act of great temerity, and attended with the\r\nresult that usually follows such attempts, raised a hope in the minds\r\nof the nobility of overcoming the people, seeing that the lowest of the\r\nplebeians were at enmity with them. And to profit by this circumstance,\r\nthey resolved to arm themselves, and with justifiable force recover\r\nthose rights of which they had been unjustly deprived. Their minds\r\nacquired such an assurance of success, that they openly provided\r\nthemselves with arms, fortified their houses, and even sent to their\r\nfriends in Lombardy for assistance. The people and the Signory made\r\npreparation for their defense, and requested aid from Perugia and\r\nSienna, so that the city was filled with the armed followers of either\r\nparty. The nobility on this side of the Arno divided themselves into\r\nthree parts; the one occupied the houses of the Cavicciulli, near the\r\nchurch of St. John; another, the houses of the Pazzi and the Donati,\r\nnear the great church of St. Peter; and the third those of the\r\nCavalcanti in the New Market. Those beyond the river fortified the\r\nbridges and the streets in which their houses stood; the Nerli defended\r\nthe bridge of the Carraja; the Frescobaldi and the Manelli, the church\r\nof the Holy Trinity; and the Rossi and the Bardi, the bridge of the\r\nRubaconte and the Old Bridge. The people were drawn together under the\r\nGonfalon of justice and the ensigns of the companies of the artisans.\r\n\r\nBoth sides being thus arranged in order of battle, the people thought\r\nit imprudent to defer the contest, and the attack was commenced by\r\nthe Medici and the Rondinelli, who assailed the Cavicciulli, where the\r\nhouses of the latter open upon the piazza of St. John. Here both parties\r\ncontended with great obstinacy, and were mutually wounded, from the\r\ntowers by stones and other missiles, and from below by arrows. They\r\nfought for three hours; but the forces of the people continuing to\r\nincrease, and the Cavicciulli finding themselves overcome by numbers,\r\nand hopeless of other assistance, submitted themselves to the people,\r\nwho saved their houses and property; and having disarmed them, ordered\r\nthem to disperse among their relatives and friends, and remain unarmed.\r\nBeing victorious in the first attack, they easily overpowered the Pazzi\r\nand the Donati, whose numbers were less than those they had subdued; so\r\nthat there only remained on this side of the Arno, the Cavalcanti, who\r\nwere strong both in respect of the post they had chosen and in their\r\nfollowers. Nevertheless, seeing all the Gonfalons against them, and\r\nthat the others had been overcome by three Gonfalons alone, they yielded\r\nwithout offering much resistance. Three parts of the city were now in\r\nthe hands of the people, and only one in possession of the nobility; but\r\nthis was the strongest, as well on account of those who held it, as from\r\nits situation, being defended by the Arno; hence it was first necessary\r\nto force the bridges. The Old Bridge was first assailed and offered a\r\nbrave resistance; for the towers were armed, the streets barricaded,\r\nand the barricades defended by the most resolute men; so that the\r\npeople were repulsed with great loss. Finding their labor at this point\r\nfruitless, they endeavored to force the Rubaconte Bridge, but no\r\nbetter success resulting, they left four Gonfalons in charge of the two\r\nbridges, and with the others attacked the bridge of the Carraja. Here,\r\nalthough the Nerli defended themselves like brave men, they could not\r\nresist the fury of the people; for this bridge, having no towers,\r\nwas weaker than the others, and was attacked by the Capponi, and many\r\nfamilies of the people who lived in that vicinity. Being thus assailed\r\non all sides, they abandoned the barricades and gave way to the people,\r\nwho then overcame the Rossi and the Frescobaldi; for all those beyond\r\nthe Arno took part with the conquerors.\r\n\r\nThere was now no resistance made except by the Bardi, who remained\r\nundaunted, notwithstanding the failure of their friends, the union of\r\nthe people against them, and the little chance of success which they\r\nseemed to have. They resolved to die fighting, and rather see their\r\nhouses burned and plundered, than submit to the power of their enemies.\r\nThey defended themselves with such obstinacy, that many fruitless\r\nattempts were made to overcome them, both at the Old Bridge and the\r\nRubaconte; but their foes were always repulsed with loss. There had in\r\nformer times been a street which led between the houses of the Pitti,\r\nfrom the Roman road to the walls upon Mount St. George. By this way\r\nthe people sent six Gonfalons, with orders to assail their houses from\r\nbehind. This attack overcame the resolution of the Bardi, and decided\r\nthe day in favor of the people; for when those who defended the\r\nbarricades in the street learned that their houses were being plundered,\r\nthey left the principal fight and hastened to their defense. This caused\r\nthe Old Bridge to be lost; the Bardi fled in all directions and were\r\nreceived into the houses of the Quaratesi, Panzanesi, and Mozzi. The\r\npeople, especially the lower classes, greedy for spoil, sacked and\r\ndestroyed their houses, and pulled down and burned their towers and\r\npalaces with such outrageous fury, that the most cruel enemy of the\r\nFlorentine name would have been ashamed of taking part in such wanton\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe nobility being thus overcome, the people reformed the government;\r\nand as they were of three kinds, the higher, the middle, and the lower\r\nclass, it was ordered that the first should appoint two signors; the two\r\nlatter three each, and that the Gonfalonier should be chosen alternately\r\nfrom either party. Besides this, all the regulations for the restraint\r\nof the nobility were renewed; and in order to weaken them still more,\r\nmany were reduced to the grade of the people. The ruin of the nobility\r\nwas so complete, and depressed them so much, that they never afterward\r\nventured to take arms for the recovery of their power, but soon became\r\nhumbled and abject in the extreme. And thus Florence lost the generosity\r\nof her character and her distinction in arms.\r\n\r\nAfter these events the city remained in peace till the year 1353. In the\r\ncourse of this period occurred the memorable plague, described with so\r\nmuch eloquence by Giovanni Boccaccio, and by which Florence lost 96,000\r\nsouls. In 1348, began the first war with the Visconti, occasioned by\r\nthe archbishop, then prince of Milan; and when this was concluded,\r\ndissensions again arose in the city; for although the nobility were\r\ndestroyed, fortune did not fail to cause new divisions and new troubles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nReflections upon the domestic discords of republics--A parallel between\r\nthe discords of Rome and those of Florence--Enmities between the\r\nfamilies of the Ricci and the Albizzi--Uguccione de' Ricci causes\r\nthe laws against the Ghibellines to be renewed in order to injure\r\nthe Albizzi--Piero degli Albizzi derives advantage from it--Origin of\r\nadmonitions and the troubles which result from them--Uguccione de'\r\nRicci moderates their injustice--Difficulties increase--A meeting of the\r\ncitizens--They address the Signory--The Signory attempt to remedy the\r\nevils.\r\n\r\nThose serious, though natural enmities, which occur between the popular\r\nclasses and the nobility, arising from the desire of the latter to\r\ncommand, and the disinclination of the former to obey, are the causes of\r\nmost of the troubles which take place in cities; and from this diversity\r\nof purpose, all the other evils which disturb republics derive their\r\norigin. This kept Rome disunited; and this, if it be allowable to\r\ncompare small things with great, held Florence in disunion; although\r\nin each city it produced a different result; for animosities were only\r\nbeginning with the people and nobility of Rome contended, while ours\r\nwere brought to a conclusion by the contentions of our citizens. A new\r\nlaw settled the disputes of Rome; those of Florence were only terminated\r\nby the death and banishment of many of her best people. Those of\r\nRome increased her military virtue, while that of Florence was quite\r\nextinguished by her divisions. The quarrels of Rome established\r\ndifferent ranks of society, those of Florence abolished the distinctions\r\nwhich had previously existed. This diversity of effects must have been\r\noccasioned by the different purposes which the two people had in view.\r\nWhile the people of Rome endeavored to associate with the nobility in\r\nthe supreme honors, those of Florence strove to exclude the nobility\r\nfrom all participation in them: as the desire of the Roman people was\r\nmore reasonable, no particular offense was given to the nobility; they\r\ntherefore consented to it without having recourse to arms; so that,\r\nafter some disputes concerning particular points, both parties agreed to\r\nthe enactment of a law which, while it satisfied the people, preserved\r\nthe nobility in the enjoyment of their dignity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the demands of the people of Florence being insolent\r\nand unjust, the nobility, became desperate, prepared for their defense\r\nwith their utmost energy, and thus bloodshed and the exile of citizens\r\nfollowed. The laws which were afterward made, did not provide for the\r\ncommon good, but were framed wholly in favor of the conquerors. This\r\ntoo, must be observed, that from the acquisition of power, made by the\r\npeople of Rome, their minds were very much improved; for all the offices\r\nof state being attainable as well by the people as the nobility,\r\nthe peculiar excellencies of the latter exercised a most beneficial\r\ninfluence upon the former; and as the city increased in virtue she\r\nattained a more exalted greatness.\r\n\r\nBut in Florence, the people being conquerors, the nobility were deprived\r\nof all participation in the government; and in order to regain a portion\r\nof it, it became necessary for them not only to seem like the people,\r\nbut to be like them in behavior, mind, and mode of living. Hence arose\r\nthose changes in armorial bearings, and in the titles of families, which\r\nthe nobility adopted, in order that they might seem to be of the people;\r\nmilitary virtue and generosity of feeling became extinguished in them;\r\nthe people not possessing these qualities, they could not appreciate\r\nthem, and Florence became by degrees more and more depressed and\r\nhumiliated. The virtue of the Roman nobility degenerating into pride,\r\nthe citizens soon found that the business of the state could not be\r\ncarried on without a prince. Florence had now come to such a point, that\r\nwith a comprehensive mind at the head of affairs she would easily have\r\nbeen made to take any form that he might have been disposed to give her;\r\nas may be partly observed by a perusal of the preceding book.\r\n\r\nHaving given an account of the origin of Florence, the commencement\r\nof her liberty, with the causes of her divisions, and shown how the\r\nfactions of the nobility and the people ceased with the tyranny of the\r\nduke of Athens, and the ruin of the former, we have now to speak of\r\nthe animosities between the citizens and the plebeians and the various\r\ncircumstances which they produced.\r\n\r\nThe nobility being overcome, and the war with the archbishop of Milan\r\nconcluded, there did not appear any cause of dissension in Florence. But\r\nthe evil fortune of the city, and the defective nature of her laws,\r\ngave rise to enmities between the family of the Albizzi and that of\r\nthe Ricci, which divided her citizens as completely as those of the\r\nBuondelmonti and the Uberti, or the Donati and the Cerchi had formerly\r\ndone. The pontiffs, who at this time resided in France, and the\r\nemperors, who abode in Germany, in order to maintain their influence\r\nin Italy, sent among us multitudes of soldiers of many countries, as\r\nEnglish, Dutch, and Bretons. As these, upon the conclusion of a war,\r\nwere thrown out of pay, though still in the country, they, under the\r\nstandard of some soldier of fortune, plundered such people as were least\r\nprepared to defend themselves. In the year 1353 one of these companies\r\ncame into Tuscany under the command of Monsignor Reale, of Provence, and\r\nhis approach terrified all the cities of Italy. The Florentines not\r\nonly provided themselves forces, but many citizens, among whom were\r\nthe Albizzi and the Ricci, armed themselves in their own defense. These\r\nfamilies were at the time full of hatred against each other, and each\r\nthought to obtain the sovereignty of the republic by overcoming his\r\nenemy. They had not yet proceeded to open violence, but only contended\r\nin the magistracies and councils. The city being all in arms, a quarrel\r\narose in the Old Market place, and, as it frequently happens in similar\r\ncases, a great number of people were drawn together. The disturbance\r\nspreading, it was told the Ricci that the Albizzi had assailed their\r\npartisans, and to the Albizzi that the Ricci were in quest of them. Upon\r\nthis the whole city arose, and it was all the magistrates could do to\r\nrestrain these families, and prevent the actual occurrence of a disaster\r\nwhich, without being the fault of either of them, had been willfully\r\nthough falsely reported as having already taken place. This apparently\r\ntrifling circumstance served to inflame the minds of the parties, and\r\nmake each the more resolved to increase the number of their followers.\r\nAnd as the citizens, since the ruin of the nobility, were on such an\r\nequality that the magistrates were more respected now than they had\r\npreviously been, they designed to proceed toward the suppression of this\r\ndisorder with civil authority alone.\r\n\r\nWe have before related, that after the victory of Charles I. the\r\ngovernment was formed of the Guelphic party, and that it thus\r\nacquired great authority over the Ghibellines. But time, a variety of\r\ncircumstances, and new divisions had so contributed to sink this party\r\nfeeling into oblivion, that many of Ghibelline descent now filled the\r\nhighest offices. Observing this, Uguccione, the head of the family of\r\nthe Ricci, contrived that the law against the Ghibellines should be\r\nagain brought into operation; many imagining the Albizzi to be of that\r\nfaction, they having arisen in Arezzo, and come long ago to Florence.\r\nUguccione by this means hoped to deprive the Albizzi of participation\r\nin the government, for all of Ghibelline blood who were found to hold\r\noffices, would be condemned in the penalties which this law provided.\r\nThe design of Uguccione was discovered to Piero son of Filippo degli\r\nAlbizzi, and he resolved to favor it: for he saw that to oppose it would\r\nat once declare him a Ghibelline; and thus the law which was renewed by\r\nthe ambition of the Ricci for his destruction, instead of robbing Piero\r\ndegli Albizzi of reputation, contributed to increase his influence,\r\nalthough it laid the foundation of many evils. Nor is it possible for\r\na republic to enact a law more pernicious than one relating to matters\r\nwhich have long transpired. Piero having favored this law, which had\r\nbeen contrived by his enemies for his stumbling-block, it became the\r\nstepping-stone to his greatness; for, making himself the leader of this\r\nnew order of things, his authority went on increasing, and he was in\r\ngreater favor with the Guelphs than any other man.\r\n\r\nAs there could not be found a magistrate willing to search out who were\r\nGhibellines, and as this renewed enactment against them was therefore\r\nof small value, it was provided that authority should be given to the\r\nCapitani to find out who were of this faction; and, having discovered,\r\nto signify and ADMONISH them that they were not to take upon\r\nthemselves any office of government; to which ADMONITIONS, if they were\r\ndisobedient, they became condemned in the penalties. Hence, all those\r\nwho in Florence are deprived of the power to hold offices are called\r\n_ammoniti_, or ADMONISHED.\r\n\r\nThe Capitani in time acquiring greater audacity, admonished not only\r\nthose to whom the admonition was applicable, but any others at the\r\nsuggestion of their own avarice or ambition; and from 1356, when this\r\nlaw was made, to 1366, there had been admonished above 200 citizens.\r\nThe Captains of the Parts and the sect of the Guelphs were thus become\r\npowerful; for every one honored them for fear of being admonished; and\r\nmost particularly the leaders, who were Piero degli Albizzi, Lapo da\r\nCastiglionchio, and Carlo Strozzi. This insolent mode of proceeding was\r\noffensive to many; but none felt so particularly injured with it as\r\nthe Ricci; for they knew themselves to have occasioned it, they saw\r\nit involved the ruin of the republic, and their enemies, the Albizzi,\r\ncontrary to their intention, became great in consequence.\r\n\r\nOn this account Uguccione de' Ricci, being one of the Signory, resolved\r\nto put an end to the evil which he and his friends had originated, and\r\nwith a new law provided that to the six Captains of Parts an additional\r\nthree should be appointed, of whom two should be chosen from the\r\ncompanies of minor artificers, and that before any party could be\r\ndeclared Ghibelline, the declaration of the Capitani must be confirmed\r\nby twenty-four Guelphic citizens, appointed for the purpose. This\r\nprovision tempered for a time the power of the Capitani, so that the\r\nadmonitions were greatly diminished, if not wholly laid aside. Still the\r\nparties of the Albizzi and the Ricci were continually on the alert to\r\noppose each other's laws, deliberations, and enterprises, not from a\r\nconviction of their inexpediency, but from a hatred of their promoters.\r\n\r\nIn such distractions the time passed from 1366 to 1371, when the\r\nGuelphs again regained the ascendant. There was in the family of the\r\nBuondelmonti a gentleman named Benchi, who, as an acknowledgment of his\r\nmerit in a war against the Pisans, though one of the nobility, had been\r\nadmitted among the people, and thus became eligible to office among the\r\nSignory; but when about to take his seat with them, a law was made that\r\nno nobleman who had become of the popular class should be allowed to\r\nassume that office. This gave great offense to Benchi, who, in union\r\nwith Piero degli Albizzi, determined to depress the less powerful of\r\nthe popular party with ADMONITIONS, and obtain the government for\r\nthemselves. By the interest which Benchi possessed with the ancient\r\nnobility, and that of Piero with most of the influential citizens, the\r\nGuelphic party resumed their ascendancy, and by new reforms among the\r\nPARTS, so remodeled the administration as to be able to dispose of the\r\noffices of the captains and the twenty-four citizens at pleasure. They\r\nthen returned to the ADMONITIONS with greater audacity than ever, and\r\nthe house of the Albizzi became powerful as the head of this faction.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Ricci made the most strenuous exertions against\r\ntheir designs; so that anxiety universally prevailed, and ruin was\r\napprehended alike from both parties. In consequence of this a great\r\nnumber of citizens, out of love to their country, assembled in the\r\nchurch of St. Piero Scarraggio, and after a long consideration of the\r\nexisting disorders, presented themselves before the Signors, whom one of\r\nthe principal among them addressed in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"Many of us, magnificent Signors! were afraid of meeting even for\r\nconsideration of public business, without being publicly called\r\ntogether, lest we should be noted as presumptuous or condemned as\r\nambitious. But seeing that so many citizens daily assemble in the lodges\r\nand halls of the palace, not for any public utility, but only for the\r\ngratification of their own ambition, we have thought that as those who\r\nassemble for the ruin of the republic are fearless, so still less ought\r\nthey to be apprehensive who meet together only for its advantage; nor\r\nought we to be anxious respecting the opinion they may form of our\r\nassembling, since they are so utterly indifferent to the opinion of\r\nothers. Our affection for our country, magnificent Signors! caused us\r\nto assemble first, and now brings us before you, to speak of grievances\r\nalready great and daily increasing in our republic, and to offer our\r\nassistance for their removal: and we doubt not that, though a difficult\r\nundertaking, it will still be attended with success, if you will lay\r\naside all private regards, and authoritatively use the public force.\r\n\r\n\"The common corruption of all the cities of Italy, magnificent Signors!\r\nhas infested and still vitiates your own; for when this province had\r\nshaken off the imperial yoke, her cities not being subject to any\r\npowerful influence that might restrain them, administered affairs, not\r\nas free men do, but as a factious populace; and hence have arisen all\r\nthe other evils and disorders that have appeared. In the first place,\r\nthere cannot be found among the citizens either unity or friendship,\r\nexcept with those whose common guilt, either against their country or\r\nagainst private individuals, is a bond of union. And as the knowledge\r\nof religion and the fear of God seem to be alike extinct, oaths and\r\npromises have lost their validity, and are kept as long as it is found\r\nexpedient; they are adopted only as a means of deception, and he is most\r\napplauded and respected whose cunning is most efficient and secure. On\r\nthis account bad men are received with the approbation due to virtue,\r\nand good ones are regarded only in the light of fools.\r\n\r\n\"And certainly in the cities of Italy all that is corruptible and\r\ncorrupting is assembled. The young are idle, the old lascivious, and\r\neach sex and every age abounds with debasing habits, which the good\r\nlaws, by misapplication, have lost the power to correct. Hence arises\r\nthe avarice so observable among the citizens, and that greediness,\r\nnot for true glory, but for unworthy honors; from which follow hatred,\r\nanimosities, quarrels, and factions; resulting in deaths, banishments,\r\naffliction to all good men, and the advancement of the most\r\nunprincipled; for the good, confiding in their innocence, seek neither\r\nsafety nor advancement by illegal methods as the wicked do, and thus\r\nunhonored and undefended they sink into oblivion.\r\n\r\n\"From proceedings such as these, arise at once the attachment for and\r\ninfluence of parties; bad men follow them through ambition and avarice,\r\nand necessity compels the good to pursue the same course. And most\r\nlamentable is it to observe how the leaders and movers of parties\r\nsanctify their base designs with words that are all piety and virtue;\r\nthey have the name of liberty constantly in their mouths, though their\r\nactions prove them her greatest enemies. The reward which they desire\r\nfrom victory is not the glory of having given liberty to the city, but\r\nthe satisfaction of having vanquished others, and of making themselves\r\nrulers; and to attain their end, there is nothing too unjust, too cruel,\r\ntoo avaricious for them to attempt. Thus laws and ordinances, peace,\r\nwars, and treaties are adopted and pursued, not for the public good, not\r\nfor the common glory of the state, but for the convenience or advantage\r\nof a few individuals.\r\n\r\n\"And if other cities abound in these disorders, ours is more than any\r\ninfected with them; for her laws, statutes, and civil ordinances are\r\nnot, nor have they ever been, established for the benefit of men in a\r\nstate of freedom, but according to the wish of the faction that has\r\nbeen uppermost at the time. Hence it follows that, when one party is\r\nexpelled, or faction extinguished, another immediately arises; for, in\r\na city that is governed by parties rather than by laws, as soon as one\r\nbecomes dominant and unopposed, it must of necessity soon divide against\r\nitself; for the private methods at first adapted for its defense will\r\nnow no longer keep it united. The truth of this, both the ancient and\r\nmodern dissensions of our city prove. Everyone thought that when the\r\nGhibellines were destroyed, the Guelphs would long continue happy and\r\nhonored; yet after a short time they divided into the Bianchi and Neri,\r\nthe black faction and the white. When the Bianchi were overcome, the\r\ncity was not long free from factions; for either, in favor of the\r\nemigrants, or on account of the animosity between the nobility and the\r\npeople, we were still constantly at war. And as if resolved to give up\r\nto others, what in mutual harmony we either would not or were unable\r\nto retain, we confided the care of our precious liberty first to King\r\nRobert, then to his brother, next to his son, and at last to the duke of\r\nAthens. Still we have never in any condition found repose, but seem\r\nlike men who can neither agree to live in freedom nor be content\r\nwith slavery. Nor did we hesitate (so greatly does the nature of our\r\nordinances dispose us to division), while yet under allegiance to the\r\nking, to substitute for his majesty, one of the vilest of men born at\r\nAgobbio.\r\n\r\n\"For the credit of the city, the name of the duke of Athens ought to be\r\nconsigned to oblivion. His cruel and tyrannical disposition, however,\r\nmight have taught us wisdom and instructed us how to live; but no sooner\r\nwas he expelled than we handled our arms, and fought with more hatred,\r\nand greater fury than we had ever done on any former occasion; so that\r\nthe ancient nobility were vanquished the city was left at the disposal\r\nof the people. It was generally supposed that no further occasion of\r\nquarrel or of party animosity could arise, since those whose pride and\r\ninsupportable ambition had been regarded as the causes of them were\r\ndepressed; however, experience proves how liable human judgment is to\r\nerror, and what false impressions men imbibe, even in regard to the\r\nthings that most intimately concern them; for we find the pride and\r\nambition of the nobility are not extinct, but only transferred from them\r\nto the people who at this moment, according to the usual practice of\r\nambitious men, are endeavoring to render themselves masters of the\r\nrepublic; and knowing they have no chance of success but what is offered\r\nby discord, they have again divided the city, and the names of Guelph\r\nand Ghibelline, which were beginning to be forgotten (and it would have\r\nbeen well if they had never been heard among us), are repeated anew in\r\nour ears.\r\n\r\n\"It seems almost necessarily ordained, in order that in human affairs\r\nthere may be nothing either settled or permanent, that in all republics\r\nthere are what may be called fatal families, born for the ruin of their\r\ncountry. Of this kind of pest our city has produced a more copious brood\r\nthan any other; for not one but many have disturbed and harassed her:\r\nfirst the Buondelmonti and the Uberti; then the Donati and the Cerchi;\r\nand now, oh ridiculous! oh disgraceful thought! the Ricci and the\r\nAlbizzi have caused a division of her citizens.\r\n\r\n\"We have not dwelt upon our corrupt habits or our old and continual\r\ndissensions to occasion you alarm, but to remind you of their causes; to\r\nshow that as you doubtless are aware of them, we also keep them in view,\r\nand to remind you that their results ought not to make you diffident\r\nof your power to repress the disorders of the present time. The ancient\r\nfamilies possessed so much influence, and were held in such high esteem,\r\nthat civil force was insufficient to restrain them; but now, when the\r\nempire has lost its ascendancy, the pope is no longer formidable, and\r\nthe whole of Italy is reduced to a state of the most complete equality,\r\nthere can be no difficulty. Our republic might more especially than any\r\nother (although at first our former practices seem to present a reason\r\nto the contrary), not only keep itself united but be improved by good\r\nlaws and civil regulations, if you, the Signory, would once resolve to\r\nundertake the matter; and to this we, induced by no other motive than\r\nthe love of our country, would most strongly urge you. It is true\r\nthe corruption of the country is great, and much discretion will be\r\nrequisite to correct it; but do not impute the past disorders to\r\nthe nature of the men, but to the times, which, being changed, give\r\nreasonable ground to hope that, with better government, our city will\r\nbe attended with better fortune; for the malignity of the people will\r\nbe overcome by restraining the ambition and annulling the ordinances of\r\nthose who have encouraged faction, and adopting in their stead only such\r\nprinciples as are conformable to true civil liberty. And be assured,\r\nthat these desirable ends will be more certainly attained by the benign\r\ninfluence of the laws, than by a delay which will compel the people to\r\neffect them by force and arms.\"\r\n\r\nThe Signory, induced by the necessity of the case, of which they were\r\npreviously aware, and further encouraged by the advice of those who now\r\naddressed them, gave authority to fifty-six citizens to provide for the\r\nsafety of the republic. It is usually found that most men are better\r\nadapted to pursue a good course already begun, than to discover one\r\napplicable to immediate circumstances. These citizens thought rather of\r\nextinguishing existing factions than of preventing the formation of\r\nnew ones, and effected neither of these objects. The facilities for the\r\nestablishment of new parties were not removed; and out of those which\r\nthey guarded against, another more powerful arose, which brought the\r\nrepublic into still greater danger. They, however, deprived three of\r\nthe family of the Albizzi, and three of that of the Ricci, of all the\r\noffices of government, except those of the Guelphic party, for three\r\nyears; and among the deprived were Piero degli Albizzi and Uguccione\r\nde' Ricci. They forbade the citizens to assemble in the palace, except\r\nduring the sittings of the Signory. They provided that if any one were\r\nbeaten, or possession of his property detained from him, he might bring\r\nhis case before the council and denounce the offender, even if he were\r\none of the nobility; and that if it were proved, the accused should be\r\nsubject to the usual penalties. This provision abated the boldness of\r\nthe Ricci, and increased that of the Albizzi; since, although it applied\r\nequally to both, the Ricci suffered from it by far the most; for if\r\nPiero was excluded from the palace of the Signory, the chamber of the\r\nGuelphs, in which he possessed the greatest authority, remained open to\r\nhim; and if he and his followers had previously been ready to ADMONISH,\r\nthey became after this injury, doubly so. To this pre-disposition for\r\nevil, new excitements were added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe war of the Florentines against the pope's legate, and the causes\r\nof it--League against the pope--The censures of the pope disregarded in\r\nFlorence--The city is divided into two factions, the one the Capitani di\r\nParte, the other of the eight commissioners of the war--Measures adopted\r\nby the Guelphic party against their adversaries--The Guelphs endeavor to\r\nprevent Salvestro de Medici from being chosen Gonfalonier--Salvestro de\r\nMedici Gonfalonier--His law against the nobility, and in favor of the\r\nAmmoniti--The _Collegi_ disapprove of the law--Salvestro addresses the\r\ncouncil in its favor--The law is passed--Disturbances in Florence.\r\n\r\nThe papal chair was occupied by Gregory XI. He, like his predecessors,\r\nresiding at Avignon, governed Italy by legates, who, proud and\r\navaricious, oppressed many of the cities. One of these legates, then\r\nat Bologna, taking advantage of a great scarcity of food at Florence,\r\nendeavored to render himself master of Tuscany, and not only withheld\r\nprovisions from the Florentines, but in order to frustrate their hopes\r\nof the future harvest, upon the approach of spring, attacked them with\r\na large army, trusting that being famished and unarmed, he should find\r\nthem an easy conquest. He might perhaps have been successful, had not\r\nhis forces been mercenary and faithless, and, therefore, induced\r\nto abandon the enterprise for the sum of 130,000 florins, which the\r\nFlorentines paid them. People may go to war when they will, but cannot\r\nalways withdraw when they like. This contest, commenced by the ambition\r\nof the legate, was sustained by the resentment of the Florentines,\r\nwho, entering into a league with Bernabo of Milan, and with the cities\r\nhostile to the church, appointed eight citizens for the administration\r\nof it, giving them authority to act without appeal, and to expend\r\nwhatever sums they might judge expedient, without rendering an account\r\nof the outlay.\r\n\r\nThis war against the pontiff, although Uguccione was now dead,\r\nreanimated those who had followed the party of the Ricci, who, in\r\nopposition to the Albizzi, had always favored Bernabo and opposed the\r\nchurch, and this, the rather, because the eight commissioners of war\r\nwere all enemies of the Guelphs. This occasioned Piero degli Albizzi,\r\nLapo da Castiglionchio, Carlo Strozzi, and others, to unite themselves\r\nmore closely in opposition to their adversaries. The eight carried on\r\nthe war, and the others admonished during three years, when the death\r\nof the pontiff put an end to the hostilities, which had been carried on\r\nwhich so much ability, and with such entire satisfaction to the people,\r\nthat at the end of each year the eight were continued in office, and\r\nwere called _Santi_, or holy, although they had set ecclesiastical\r\ncensures at defiance, plundered the churches of their property, and\r\ncompelled the priests to perform divine service. So much did citizens\r\nat that time prefer the good of their country to their ghostly\r\nconsolations, and thus showed the church, that if as her friends they\r\nhad defended, they could as enemies depress her; for the whole of\r\nRomagna, the Marches, and Perugia were excited to rebellion.\r\n\r\nYet while this war was carried on against the pope, they were unable to\r\ndefend themselves against the captains of the parts and their faction;\r\nfor the insolence of the Guelphs against the eight attained such a\r\npitch, that they could not restrain themselves from abusive behavior,\r\nnot merely against some of the most distinguished citizens, but even\r\nagainst the eight themselves; and the captains of the parts conducted\r\nthemselves with such arrogance, that they were feared more than the\r\nSignory. Those who had business with them treated them with greater\r\nreverence, and their court was held in higher estimation: so that no\r\nambassador came to Florence, without commission to the captains.\r\n\r\nPope Gregory being dead, and the city freed from external war; there\r\nstill prevailed great confusion within; for the audacity of the Guelphs\r\nwas insupportable, and as no available mode of subduing them presented\r\nitself, it was thought that recourse must be had to arms, to determine\r\nwhich party was the strongest. With the Guelphs were all the ancient\r\nnobility, and the greater part of the most popular leaders, of which\r\nnumber, as already remarked, were Lapo, Piero, and Carlo. On the other\r\nside, were all the lower orders, the leaders of whom were the eight\r\ncommissioners of war, Giorgio Scali and Tommaso Strozzi, and with them\r\nthe Ricci, Alberti, and Medici. The rest of the multitude, as most\r\ncommonly happens, joined the discontented party.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to the heads of the Guelphic faction that their enemies\r\nwould be greatly strengthened, and themselves in considerable danger in\r\ncase a hostile Signory should resolve on their subjugation. Desirous,\r\ntherefore, of being prepared against this calamity, the leaders of the\r\nparty assembled to take into consideration the state of the city and\r\nthat of their own friends in particular, and found the _ammoniti_ so\r\nnumerous and so great a difficulty, that the whole city was excited\r\nagainst them on this account. They could not devise any other remedy\r\nthan, that as their enemies had deprived them of all the offices of\r\nhonor, they should banish their opponents from the city, take possession\r\nof the palace of the Signory, and bring over the whole state to their\r\nown party; in imitation of the Guelphs of former times, who found no\r\nsafety in the city, till they had driven all their adversaries out of\r\nit. They were unanimous upon the main point, but did not agree upon the\r\ntime of carrying it into execution. It was in the month of April, in the\r\nyear 1378, when Lapo, thinking delay inadvisable, expressed his opinion,\r\nthat procrastination was in the highest degree perilous to themselves;\r\nas in the next Signory, Salvestro de' Medici would very probably be\r\nelected Gonfalonier, and they all knew he was opposed to their party.\r\nPiero degli Albizzi, on the other hand, thought it better to defer,\r\nsince they would require forces, which could not be assembled without\r\nexciting observation, and if they were discovered, they would incur\r\ngreat risk. He thereupon judged it preferable to wait till the\r\napproaching feast of St. John on which, being the most solemn festival\r\nof the city, vast multitudes would be assembled, among whom they\r\nmight conceal whatever numbers they pleased. To obviate their fears of\r\nSalvestro, he was to be ADMONISHED, and if this did not appear likely to\r\nbe effectual, they would \"ADMONISH\" one of the Colleague of his quarter,\r\nand upon redrawing, as the ballot-boxes would be nearly empty, chance\r\nwould very likely occasion that either he or some associate of his\r\nwould be drawn, and he would thus be rendered incapable of sitting as\r\nGonfalonier. They therefore came to the conclusion proposed by Piero,\r\nthough Lapo consented reluctantly, considering the delay dangerous, and\r\nthat, as no opportunity can be in all respects suitable, he who waits\r\nfor the concurrence of every advantage, either never makes an attempt,\r\nor, if induced to do so, is most frequently foiled. They \"admonished\"\r\nthe Colleague, but did not prevent the appointment of Salvestro, for the\r\ndesign was discovered by the Eight, who took care to render all attempts\r\nupon the drawing futile.\r\n\r\nSalvestro Alammano de' Medici was therefore drawn Gonfalonier, and,\r\nbeing one of the noblest popular families, he could not endure that the\r\npeople should be oppressed by a few powerful persons. Having resolved\r\nto put an end to their insolence, and perceiving the middle classes\r\nfavorably disposed, and many of the highest of the people on his side,\r\nhe communicated his design to Benedetto Alberti, Tommaso Strozzi, and\r\nGeorgio Scali, who all promised their assistance. They, therefore,\r\nsecretly draw up a law which had for its object to revive the\r\nrestrictions upon the nobility, to retrench the authority of the\r\nCapitani di Parte, and recall the _ammoniti_ to their dignity. In order\r\nto attempt and obtain their ends, at one and the same time, having to\r\nconsult, first the Colleagues and then the Councils, Salvestro being\r\nProvost (which office for the time makes its possessor almost prince of\r\nthe city), he called together the Colleagues and the Council on the same\r\nmorning, and the Colleagues being apart, he proposed the law prepared\r\nby himself and his friends, which, being a novelty, encountered in their\r\nsmall number so much opposition, that he was unable to have it passed.\r\n\r\nSalvestro, seeing his first attempt likely to fail, pretended to leave\r\nthe room for a private reason, and, without being perceived, went\r\nimmediately to the Council, and taking a lofty position from which he\r\ncould be both seen and heard, said:--\"That considering himself invested\r\nwith the office of Gonfalonier, not so much to preside in private\r\ncases (for which proper judges were appointed, who have their regular\r\nsittings), as to guard the state, correct the insolence of the powerful,\r\nand ameliorate those laws by the influence of which the republic was\r\nbeing ruined, he had carefully attended to both these duties, and to his\r\nutmost ability provided for them, but found the perversity of some so\r\nmuch opposed to his just designs as to deprive him of all opportunity of\r\ndoing good, and them not only of the means of assisting him with\r\ntheir counsel, but even hearing him. Therefore finding he no longer\r\ncontributed either to the benefit of the republic or of the people\r\ngenerally, he could not perceive any reason for his longer holding the\r\nmagistracy, of which he was either undeserving, or others thought him\r\nso, and would therefore retire to his house, that the people might\r\nappoint another in his stead, who would either have greater virtue or\r\nbetter fortune than himself.\" And having said this, he left the room as\r\nif to return home.\r\n\r\nThose of the council who were in the secret, and others desirous of\r\nnovelty, raised a tumult, at which the Signory and the Colleagues came\r\ntogether, and finding the Gonfalonier leaving them, entreatingly and\r\nauthoritatively detained him, and obliged him to return to the council\r\nroom, which was now full of confusion. Many of the noble citizens\r\nwere threatened in opprobrious language; and an artificer seized Carlo\r\nStrozzi by the throat, and would undoubtedly have murdered him, but\r\nwas with difficulty prevented by those around. He who made the greatest\r\ndisturbance, and incited the city to violence, was Benedetto degli\r\nAlberti, who, from a window of the palace, loudly called the people to\r\narms; and presently the courtyards were filled with armed men, and the\r\nColleagues granted to threats, what they had refused to entreaty. The\r\nCapitani di Parte had at the same time drawn together a great number of\r\ncitizens to their hall to consult upon the means of defending themselves\r\nagainst the orders of the Signors, but when they heard the tumult that\r\nwas raised, and were informed of the course the Councils had adopted,\r\neach took refuge in his own house.\r\n\r\nLet no one, when raising popular commotions, imagine he can afterward\r\ncontrol them at his pleasure, or restrain them from proceeding to the\r\ncommission of violence. Salvestro intended to enact his law, and compose\r\nthe city; but it happened otherwise; for the feelings of all had\r\nbecome so excited, that they shut up the shops; the citizens fortified\r\nthemselves in their houses; many conveyed their valuable property into\r\nthe churches and monasteries, and everyone seemed to apprehend something\r\nterrible at hand. The companies of the Arts met, and each appointed\r\nan additional officer or Syndic; upon which the Priors summoned their\r\nColleagues and these Syndics, and consulted a whole day how the city\r\nmight be appeased with satisfaction to the different parties; but much\r\ndifference of opinion prevailed, and no conclusion was come to. On the\r\nfollowing day the Arts brought forth their banners, which the Signory\r\nunderstanding, and being apprehensive of evil, called the Council\r\ntogether to consider what course to adopt. But scarcely were they\r\nmet, when the uproar recommenced, and soon the ensigns of the Arts,\r\nsurrounded by vast numbers of armed men, occupied the courts. Upon this\r\nthe Council, to give the Arts and the people hope of redress, and free\r\nthemselves as much as possible from the charge of causing the mischief,\r\ngave a general power, which in Florence is called _Balia_, to the\r\nSignors, the Colleagues, the Eight, the Capitani di Parte, and to the\r\nSyndics of the Arts, to reform the government of the city, for the\r\ncommon benefit of all. While this was being arranged, a few of the\r\nensigns of the Arts and some of the mob, desirous of avenging themselves\r\nfor the recent injuries they had received from the Guelphs, separated\r\nthemselves from the rest, and sacked and burnt the house of Lapo da\r\nCastiglionchio, who, when he learned the proceedings of the Signory\r\nagainst the Guelphs, and saw the people in arms, having no other\r\nresource but concealment or flight, first took refuge in Santa Croce,\r\nand afterward, being disguised as a monk, fled into the Casentino, where\r\nhe was often heard to blame himself for having consented to wait till\r\nSt. John's day, before they had made themselves sure of the government.\r\nPiero degli Albizzi and Carlo Strozzi hid themselves upon the first\r\noutbreak of the tumult, trusting that when it was over, by the interest\r\nof their numerous friends and relations, they might remain safely in\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nThe house of Lapo being burnt, as mischief begins with difficulty but\r\neasily increases, many other houses, either through public hatred, or\r\nprivate malice, shared the same fate; and the rioters, that they might\r\nhave companions more eager than themselves to assist them in their work\r\nof plunder, broke open the public prisons, and then sacked the monastery\r\nof the Agnoli and the convent of S. Spirito, whither many citizens\r\nhad taken their most valuable goods for safety. Nor would the public\r\nchambers have escaped these destroyers' hands, except out of reverence\r\nfor one of the Signors, who on horseback, and followed by many citizens\r\nin arms, opposed the rage of the mob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nContrary measures adopted by the magistrates to effect a\r\npacification--Luigi Guicciardini the Gonfalonier entreats the\r\nmagistrates of the Arts to endeavor to pacify the people--Serious riot\r\ncaused by the plebeians--The woolen Art--The plebeians assemble--The\r\nspeech of a seditious plebeian--Their resolution thereupon--The Signory\r\ndiscover the designs of the plebeians--Measures adopted to counteract\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis popular fury being abated by the authority of the Signors and\r\nthe approach of night, on the following day, the Balia relieved the\r\nadmonished, on condition that they should not for three years be capable\r\nof holding any magistracy. They annulled the laws made by the Guelphs to\r\nthe prejudice of the citizens; declared Lapo da Castiglionchio and his\r\ncompanions, rebels, and with them many others, who were the objects of\r\nuniversal detestation. After these resolutions, the new Signory were\r\ndrawn for, and Luigi Guicciardini appointed Gonfalonier, which gave hope\r\nthat the tumults would soon be appeased; for everyone thought them to be\r\npeaceable men and lovers of order. Still the shops were not opened, nor\r\ndid the citizens lay down their arms, but continued to patrol the city\r\nin great numbers; so that the Signory did not assume the magistracy with\r\nthe usual pomp, but merely assembled within the palace, omitting all\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nThis Signory, considering nothing more advisable in the beginning of\r\ntheir magistracy than to restore peace, caused a relinquishment of arms;\r\nordered the shops to be opened, and the strangers who had been called to\r\ntheir aid, to return to their homes. They appointed guards in many parts\r\nof the city, so that if the admonished would only have remained quiet,\r\norder would soon have been re-established. But they were not satisfied\r\nto wait three years for the recovery of their honours; so that to\r\ngratify them the Arts again met, and demanded of the Signory, that for\r\nthe benefit and quiet of the city, they would ordain that no citizens\r\nshould at any time, whether Signor, Colleague, Capitano di Parte, or\r\nConsul of any art whatever, be admonished as a Ghibelline; and further,\r\nthat new ballots of the Guelphic party should be made, and the old ones\r\nburned. These demands were at once acceded to, not only by the Signors,\r\nbut by all the Councils; and thus it was hoped the tumults newly excited\r\nwould be settled.\r\n\r\nBut since men are not satisfied with recovering what is their own, but\r\nwish to possess the property of others and to revenge themselves,\r\nthose who were in hopes of benefiting by these disorders persuaded the\r\nartificers that they would never be safe, if several of their enemies\r\nwere not expelled from the city or destroyed. This terrible doctrine\r\ncoming to the knowledge of the Signory, they caused the magistrates\r\nof the Arts and their Syndics to be brought before them, and Luigi\r\nGuicciardini, the Gonfalonier, addressed them in the following words:\r\n\"If these Signors, and I with them, had not long been acquainted with\r\nthe fate of this city, that as soon as external wars have ceased\r\nthe internal commence, we should have been more surprised, and our\r\ndispleasure would have been greater. But as evils to which we are\r\naccustomed are less annoying, we have endured past disturbances\r\npatiently, they having arisen for the most part without our fault; and\r\nwe hoped that, like former troubles, they would soon have an end, after\r\nthe many and great concessions we had made at your suggestion. But\r\nfinding that you are yet unsettled, that you contemplate the commission\r\nof new crimes against your fellow-citizens, and are desirous of making\r\nnew exiles, our displeasure increases in proportion to your misconduct.\r\nAnd certainly, could we have believed that during our magistracy the\r\ncity was to be ruined, whether with or without your concurrence, we\r\nshould certainly, either by flight or exile, have avoided these horrors.\r\nBut trusting that we had to do with those who possessed some feelings\r\nof humanity and some love of their country, we willingly accepted the\r\nmagistracy, thinking that by our gentleness we should overcome your\r\nambition. But we perceive from experience that the more humble our\r\nbehavior, the more concessions we make, the prouder you become, and the\r\nmore exorbitant are your demands. And though we speak thus, it is not in\r\norder to offend, but to amend you. Let others tell you pleasing tales,\r\nour design is to communicate only what is for your good. Now we would\r\nask you, and have you answer on your honor, What is there yet ungranted,\r\nthat you can, with any appearance of propriety, require? You wished to\r\nhave authority taken from the Capitani di Parte; and it is done. You\r\nwished that the ballotings should be burned, and a reformation of them\r\ntake place; and we consent. You desired that the admonished should be\r\nrestored to their honours; and it is permitted. At your entreaty we have\r\npardoned those who have burned down houses and plundered churches;\r\nmany honorable citizens have been exiled to please you; and at your\r\nsuggestion new restraints have been laid upon the Great. When will there\r\nbe an end of your demands? and how long will you continue to abuse our\r\nliberality? Do you not observe with how much more moderation we bear\r\ndefeat than you your victory? To what end will your divisions bring our\r\ncity? Have you forgotten that when disunited Castruccio, a low citizen\r\nof Lucca, subdued her? or that a duke of Athens, your hired captain did\r\nso too? But when the citizens were united in her defense, an archbishop\r\nof Milan and a pope were unable to subdue it, and, after many years of\r\nwar, were compelled to retire with disgrace.\r\n\r\n\"Then why would you, by your discords, reduce to slavery in a time of\r\npeace, that city, which so many powerful enemies have left free, even in\r\nwar? What can you expect from your disunion but subjugation? or from the\r\nproperty of which you already have plundered, or may yet plunder us, but\r\npoverty? for this property is the means by which we furnish occupation\r\nfor the whole city, and if you take it from us, our means of finding\r\nthat occupation is withdrawn. Besides, those who take it will have\r\ndifficulty in preserving what is dishonestly acquired, and thus poverty\r\nand destitution are brought upon the city. Now, I, and these Signors\r\ncommand, and if it were consistent with propriety, we would entreat that\r\nyou allow your minds to be calmed; be content, rest satisfied with the\r\nprovisions that have been made for you; and if you should be found to\r\nneed anything further, make your request with decency and order, and not\r\nwith tumult; for when your demands are reasonable they will always be\r\ncomplied with, and you will not give occasion to evil designing men\r\nto ruin your country and cast the blame upon yourselves.\" These words\r\nconveying nothing but the truth, produced a suitable effect upon the\r\nminds of the citizens, who thanking the Gonfalonier for having acted\r\ntoward them the part of a king Signor, and toward the city that of a\r\ngood citizen, offered their obedience in whatever might be committed\r\nto them. And the Signors, to prove the sincerity of their intentions,\r\nappointed two citizens for each of the superior magistracies, who, with\r\nSyndics of the arts, were to consider what could be done to restore\r\nquite, and report their resolutions to the Signors.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were in progress, a disturbance arose, much more\r\ninjurious to the republic than anything that had hitherto occurred.\r\nThe greatest part of the fires and robberies which took place on the\r\nprevious days were perpetrated by the very lowest of the people; and\r\nthose who had been the most audacious, were afraid that when the greater\r\ndifferences were composed, they would be punished for the crimes they\r\nhad committed; and that as usual, they would be abandoned by those who\r\nhad instigated them to the commission of crime. To this may be added,\r\nthe hatred of the lower orders toward the rich citizens and the\r\nprincipals of the arts, because they did not think themselves\r\nremunerated for their labor in a manner equal to their merits. For in\r\nthe time of Charles I., when the city was divided into arts, a head or\r\ngovernor was appointed to each, and it was provided that the individuals\r\nof each art, should be judged in civil matters by their own superiors.\r\nThese arts, as we have before observed, were at first twelve; in the\r\ncourse of time they were increased to twenty-one, and attained so much\r\npower, that in a few years they grasped the entire government of the\r\ncity; and as some were in greater esteem than others, they were divided\r\ninto MAJOR and MINOR; seven were called \"major,\" and fourteen, the\r\n\"minor arts.\" From this division, and from other causes which we have\r\nnarrated above, arose the arrogance of the Capitani di Parte; for those\r\ncitizens who had formerly been Guelphs, and had the constant disposal of\r\nthat magistracy, favored the followers of the major and persecuted\r\nthe minor arts and their patrons; and hence arose the many commotions\r\nalready mentioned. When the companies of the arts were first organized,\r\nmany of those trades, followed by the lowest of the people and the\r\nplebeians, were not incorporated, but were ranged under those arts\r\nmost nearly allied to them; and, hence, when they were not properly\r\nremunerated for their labor, or their masters oppressed them, they had\r\nno one of whom to seek redress, except the magistrate of the art to\r\nwhich theirs was subject; and of him they did not think justice always\r\nattainable. Of the arts, that which had always had, and now has, the\r\ngreatest number of these subordinates, is the woolen; which being\r\nboth then, and still, the most powerful body, and first in authority,\r\nsupports the greater part of the plebeians and lowest of the people.\r\n\r\nThe lower classes, then, the subordinates not only of the woolen,\r\nbut also of the other arts, were discontented, from the causes just\r\nmentioned; and their apprehension of punishment for the burnings and\r\nrobberies they had committed, did not tend to compose them. Meetings\r\ntook place in different parts during the night, to talk over the past,\r\nand to communicate the danger in which they were, when one of the most\r\ndaring and experienced, in order to animate the rest, spoke thus:\r\n\r\n\"If the question now were, whether we should take up arms, rob and burn\r\nthe houses of the citizens, and plunder churches, I am one of those who\r\nwould think it worthy of further consideration, and should, perhaps,\r\nprefer poverty and safety to the dangerous pursuit of an uncertain good.\r\nBut as we have already armed, and many offenses have been committed, it\r\nappears to me that we have to consider how to lay them aside, and secure\r\nourselves from the consequences of what is already done. I certainly\r\nthink, that if nothing else could teach us, necessity might. You see the\r\nwhole city full of complaint and indignation against us; the citizens\r\nare closely united, and the signors are constantly with the magistrates.\r\nYou may be sure they are contriving something against us; they are\r\narranging some new plan to subdue us. We ought therefore to keep two\r\nthings in view, and have two points to consider; the one is, to escape\r\nwith impunity for what has been done during the last few days, and the\r\nother, to live in greater comfort and security for the time to come. We\r\nmust, therefore, I think, in order to be pardoned for our faults, commit\r\nnew ones; redoubling the mischief, and multiplying fires and robberies;\r\nand in doing this, endeavor to have as many companions as we can; for\r\nwhen many are in fault, few are punished; small crimes are chastised,\r\nbut great and serious ones rewarded. When many suffer, few seek\r\nvengeance; for general evils are endured more patiently than private\r\nones. To increase the number of misdeeds will, therefore, make\r\nforgiveness more easily attainable, and will open the way to secure what\r\nwe require for our own liberty. And it appears evident that the gain is\r\ncertain; for our opponents are disunited and rich; their disunion will\r\ngive us the victory, and their riches, when they have become ours, will\r\nsupport us. Be not deceived about that antiquity of blood by which they\r\nexalt themselves above us; for all men having had one common origin, are\r\nall equally ancient, and nature has made us all after one fashion. Strip\r\nus naked, and we shall all be found alike. Dress us in their clothing,\r\nand they in ours, we shall appear noble, they ignoble--for poverty and\r\nriches make all the difference. It grieves me much to think that some\r\nof you are sorry inwardly for what is done, and resolve to abstain from\r\nanything more of the kind. Certainly, if it be so, you are not the men\r\nI took you for; because neither shame nor conscience ought to have\r\nany influence with you. Conquerors, by what means soever, are never\r\nconsidered aught but glorious. We have no business to think\r\nabout conscience; for when, like us, men have to fear hunger, and\r\nimprisonment, or death, the fear of hell neither can nor ought to have\r\nany influence upon them. If you only notice human proceedings, you may\r\nobserve that all who attain great power and riches, make use of\r\neither force or fraud; and what they have acquired either by deceit or\r\nviolence, in order to conceal the disgraceful methods of attainment,\r\nthey endeavor to sanctify with the false title of honest gains. Those\r\nwho either from imprudence or want of sagacity avoid doing so, are\r\nalways overwhelmed with servitude and poverty; for faithful servants are\r\nalways servants, and honest men are always poor; nor do any ever escape\r\nfrom servitude but the bold and faithless, or from poverty, but the\r\nrapacious and fraudulent. God and nature have thrown all human fortunes\r\ninto the midst of mankind; and they are thus attainable rather by rapine\r\nthan by industry, by wicked actions rather than by good. Hence it is\r\nthat men feed upon each other, and those who cannot defend themselves\r\nmust be worried. Therefore we must use force when the opportunity\r\noffers; and fortune cannot present us one more favorable than the\r\npresent, when the citizens are still disunited, the Signory doubtful,\r\nand the magistrates terrified; for we may easily conquer them before\r\nthey can come to any settled arrangement. By this means we shall either\r\nobtain the entire government of the city, or so large a share of it, as\r\nto be forgiven past errors, and have sufficient authority to threaten\r\nthe city with a renewal of them at some future time. I confess this\r\ncourse is bold and dangerous, but when necessity presses, audacity\r\nbecomes prudence, and in great affairs the brave never think of dangers.\r\nThe enterprises that are begun with hazard always have a reward at last;\r\nand no one ever escaped from embarrassment without some peril. Besides,\r\nit is easy to see from all their preparations of prisons, racks, and\r\ninstruments of death, that there is more danger in inaction than in\r\nendeavoring to secure ourselves; for in the first case the evils are\r\ncertain, in the latter doubtful. How often have I heard you complain of\r\nthe avarice of your superiors and the injustice of your magistrates. Now\r\nthen is the time, not only to liberate yourself from them, but to become\r\nso much superior, that they will have more causes of grief and fear\r\nfrom you, than you from them. The opportunity presented by circumstances\r\npasses away, and when gone, it will be vain to think it can be recalled.\r\nYou see the preparations of our enemies; let us anticipate them; and\r\nthose who are first in arms will certainly be victors, to the ruin of\r\ntheir enemies and their own exaltation; and thus honors will accrue to\r\nmany of us and security to all.\" These arguments greatly inflamed minds\r\nalready disposed to mischief, so that they determined to take up arms as\r\nsoon as they had acquired a sufficient number of associates, and bound\r\nthemselves by oath to mutual defense, in case any of them were subdued\r\nby the civil power.\r\n\r\nWhile they were arranging to take possession of the republic, their\r\ndesign became known to the Signory, who, having taken a man named\r\nSimone, learned from him the particulars of the conspiracy, and that the\r\noutbreak was to take place on the following day. Finding the danger so\r\npressing, they called together the colleagues and those citizens who\r\nwith the syndics of the arts were endeavoring to effect the union of the\r\ncity. It was then evening, and they advised the signors to assemble the\r\nconsuls of the trades, who proposed that whatever armed force was in\r\nFlorence should be collected, and with the Gonfaloniers of the people\r\nand their companies, meet under arms in the piazza next morning. It\r\nhappened that while Simone was being tortured, a man named Niccolo da\r\nSan Friano was regulating the palace clock, and becoming acquainted\r\nwith what was going on, returned home and spread the report of it in his\r\nneighborhood, so that presently the piazza of St. Spirito was\r\noccupied by above a thousand men. This soon became known to the other\r\nconspirators, and San Pietro Maggiore and St. Lorenzo, their places of\r\nassembly, were presently full of them, all under arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nProceedings of the plebeians--The demand they make of the Signory--They\r\ninsist that the Signory leave the palace--The Signory leave the\r\npalace--Michael di Lando Gonfalonier--Complaints and movements of the\r\nplebeians against Michael di Lando--Michael di Lando proceeds against\r\nthe plebeians and reduces them to order--Character of Michael di Lando.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on the 21st of July, there did not appear in the piazza\r\nabove eighty men in arms friendly to the Signory, and not one of\r\nthe Gonfaloniers; for knowing the whole city to be in a state of\r\ninsurrection they were afraid to leave their homes. The first body of\r\nplebeians that made its appearance was that which had assembled at San\r\nPietro Maggiore; but the armed force did not venture to attack them.\r\nThen came the other multitudes, and finding no opposition, they loudly\r\ndemanded their prisoners from the Signory; and being resolved to have\r\nthem by force if they were not yielded to their threats, they burned\r\nthe house of Luigi Guicciardini; and the Signory, for fear of greater\r\nmischief, set them at liberty. With this addition to their strength they\r\ntook the Gonfalon of Justice from the bearer, and under the shadow\r\nof authority which it gave them, burned the houses of many citizens,\r\nselecting those whose owners had publicly or privately excited their\r\nhatred. Many citizens, to avenge themselves for private injuries,\r\nconducted them to the houses of their enemies; for it was quite\r\nsufficient to insure its destruction, if a single voice from the mob\r\ncalled out, \"To the house of such a one,\" or if he who bore the Gonfalon\r\ntook the road toward it. All the documents belonging to the woolen\r\ntrade were burned, and after the commission of much violence, by way\r\nof associating it with something laudable, Salvestro de Medici and\r\nsixty-three other citizens were made knights, among whom were Benedetto\r\nand Antonio degli Alberti, Tommaso Strozzi and others similarly their\r\nfriends; though many received the honor against their wills. It was\r\na remarkable peculiarity of the riots, that many who had their houses\r\nburned, were on the same day, and by the same party made knights; so\r\nclose were the kindness and the injury together. This circumstance\r\noccurred to Luigi Guicciardini, Gonfalonier of Justice.\r\n\r\nIn this tremendous uproar, the Signory, finding themselves abandoned by\r\ntheir armed force, by the leaders of the arts, and by the Gonfaloniers,\r\nbecame dismayed; for none had come to their assistance in obedience to\r\norders; and of the sixteen Gonfalons, the ensign of the Golden Lion\r\nand of the Vaio, under Giovenco della Stufa and Giovanni Cambi alone\r\nappeared; and these, not being joined by any other, soon withdrew.\r\nOf the citizens, on the other hand, some, seeing the fury of this\r\nunreasonable multitude and the palace abandoned, remained within doors;\r\nothers followed the armed mob, in the hope that by being among them,\r\nthey might more easily protect their own houses or those of their\r\nfriends. The power of the plebeians was thus increased and that of the\r\nSignory weakened. The tumult continued all day, and at night the rioters\r\nhalted near the palace of Stefano, behind the church of St. Barnabas.\r\nTheir number exceeded six thousand, and before daybreak they obtained\r\nby threats the ensigns of the trades, with which and the Gonfalon of\r\nJustice, when morning came, they proceeded to the palace of the provost,\r\nwho refusing to surrender it to them, they took possession of it by\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThe Signory, desirous of a compromise, since they could not restrain\r\nthem by force, appointed four of the Colleagues to proceed to the palace\r\nof the provost, and endeavor to learn what was their intention. They\r\nfound that the leaders of the plebeians, with the Syndics of the trades\r\nand some citizens, had resolved to signify their wishes to the Signory.\r\nThey therefore returned with four deputies of the plebeians, who\r\ndemanded that the woolen trade should not be allowed to have a foreign\r\njudge; that there should be formed three new companies of the arts;\r\nnamely, one for the wool combers and dyers, one for the barbers,\r\ndoublet-makers, tailors, and such like, and the third for the lowest\r\nclass of people. They required that the three new arts should furnish\r\ntwo Signors; the fourteen minor arts, three; and that the Signory should\r\nprovide a suitable place of assembly for them. They also made it a\r\ncondition that no member of these companies should be expected during\r\ntwo years to pay any debt that amounted to less than fifty ducats; that\r\nthe bank should take no interest on loans already contracted, and that\r\nonly the principal sum should be demanded; that the condemned and the\r\nbanished should be forgiven, and the admonished should be restored to\r\nparticipation in the honors of government. Besides these, many other\r\narticles were stipulated in favor of their friends, and a requisition\r\nmade that many of their enemies should be exiled and admonished. These\r\ndemands, though grievous and dishonorable to the republic, were for fear\r\nof further violence granted, by the joint deliberation of the Signors,\r\nColleagues, and Council of the people. But in order to give it full\r\neffect, it was requisite that the Council of the Commune should also\r\ngive its consent; and, as they could not assemble two councils during\r\nthe same day it was necessary to defer it till the morrow. However the\r\ntrades appeared content, the plebeians satisfied; and both promised,\r\nthat these laws being confirmed, every disturbance should cease.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, while the Council of the Commune were in\r\nconsultation, the impatient and volatile multitude entered the piazza,\r\nunder their respective ensigns, with loud and fearful shouts,\r\nwhich struck terror into all the Council and Signory; and Guerrente\r\nMarignolli, one of the latter, influenced more by fear than anything\r\nelse, under pretense of guarding the lower doors, left the chamber and\r\nfled to his house. He was unable to conceal himself from the multitude,\r\nwho, however, took no notice, except that, upon seeing him, they\r\ninsisted that all the Signors should quit the palace, and declared\r\nthat if they refused to comply, their houses should be burned and their\r\nfamilies put to death.\r\n\r\nThe law had now been passed; the Signors were in their own apartments;\r\nthe Council had descended from the chamber, and without leaving the\r\npalace, hopeless of saving the city, they remained in the lodges and\r\ncourts below, overwhelmed with grief at seeing such depravity in the\r\nmultitude, and such perversity or fear in those who might either have\r\nrestrained or suppressed them. The Signory, too, were dismayed and\r\nfearful for the safety of their country, finding themselves abandoned\r\nby one of their associates, and without any aid or even advice; when, at\r\nthis moment of uncertainty as to what was about to happen, or what would\r\nbe best to be done, Tommaso Strozzi and Benedetto Alberti, either from\r\nmotives of ambition (being desirous of remaining masters of the palace),\r\nor because they thought it the most advisable step, persuaded them to\r\ngive way to the popular impulse, and withdraw privately to their homes.\r\nThis advice, given by those who had been the leaders of the tumult,\r\nalthough the others yielded, filled Alamanno Acciajuoli and Niccolo del\r\nBene, two of the Signors, with anger; and, reassuming a little vigor,\r\nthey said, that if the others would withdraw they could not help it, but\r\nthey would remain as long as they continued in office, if they did not\r\nin the meantime lose their lives. These dissensions redoubled the fears\r\nof the Signory and the rage of the people, so that the Gonfalonier,\r\ndisposed rather to conclude his magistracy in dishonor than in danger,\r\nrecommended himself to the care of Tommaso Strozzi, who withdrew him\r\nfrom the palace and conducted him to his house. The other Signors were,\r\none after another, conveyed in the same manner, so that Alamanno and\r\nNiccolo, not to appear more valiant than wise, seeing themselves left\r\nalone, also retired, and the palace fell into the hands of the plebeians\r\nand the Eight Commissioners of War, who had not yet laid down their\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nWhen the plebeians entered the palace, the standard of the Gonfalonier\r\nof Justice was in the hands of Michael di Lando, a wool comber. This\r\nman, barefoot, with scarcely anything upon him, and the rabble at his\r\nheels, ascended the staircase, and, having entered the audience chamber\r\nof the Signory, he stopped, and turning to the multitude said, \"You see\r\nthis palace is now yours, and the city is in your power; what do you\r\nthink ought to be done?\" To which they replied, they would have him for\r\ntheir Gonfalonier and lord; and that he should govern them and the city\r\nas he thought best. Michael accepted the command; and, as he was a cool\r\nand sagacious man, more favored by nature than by fortune, he resolved\r\nto compose the tumult, and restore peace to the city. To occupy the\r\nminds of the people, and give himself time to make some arrangement, he\r\nordered that one Nuto, who had been appointed bargello, or sheriff,\r\nby Lapo da Castiglionchio, should be sought. The greater part of his\r\nfollowers went to execute this commission; and, to commence with justice\r\nthe government he had acquired by favor, he commanded that no one should\r\neither burn or steal anything; while, to strike terror into all, he\r\ncaused a gallows to be erected in the court of the palace. He began\r\nthe reform of government by deposing the Syndics of the trades, and\r\nappointing new ones; he deprived the Signory and the Colleagues of their\r\nmagistracy, and burned the balloting purses containing the names of\r\nthose eligible to office under the former government.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Ser Nuto, being brought by the mob into the court, was\r\nsuspended from the gallows by one foot; and those around having torn him\r\nto pieces, in little more than a moment nothing remained of him but the\r\nfoot by which he had been tied.\r\n\r\nThe Eight Commissioners of War, on the other hand, thinking themselves,\r\nafter the departure of the Signors, left sole masters of the city, had\r\nalready formed a new Signory; but Michael, on hearing this, sent them\r\nan order to quit the palace immediately; for he wished to show that he\r\ncould govern Florence without their assistance. He then assembled the\r\nSyndics of the trades, and created as a Signory, four from the lowest\r\nplebeians; two from the major, and two from the minor trades. Besides\r\nthis, he made a new selection of names for the balloting purses, and\r\ndivided the state into three parts; one composed of the new trades,\r\nanother of the minor, and the third of the major trades. He gave to\r\nSalvestro de' Medici the revenue of the shops upon the Old Bridge; for\r\nhimself he took the provostry of Empoli, and conferred benefits upon\r\nmany other citizens, friends of the plebeians; not so much for the\r\npurpose of rewarding their labors, as that they might serve to screen\r\nhim from envy.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the plebeians that Michael, in his reformation of the\r\nstate, had too much favored the higher ranks of the people, and that\r\nthemselves had not a sufficient share in the government to enable them\r\nto preserve it; and hence, prompted by their usual audacity, they again\r\ntook arms, and coming tumultuously into the court of the palace, each\r\nbody under their particular ensigns, insisted that the Signory\r\nshould immediately descend and consider new means for advancing their\r\nwell-being and security. Michael, observing their arrogance, was\r\nunwilling to provoke them, but without further yielding to their\r\nrequest, blamed the manner in which it was made, advised them to lay\r\ndown their arms, and promised that then would be conceded to them, what\r\notherwise, for the dignity of the state, must of necessity be withheld.\r\nThe multitude, enraged at this reply, withdrew to Santa Maria Novella,\r\nwhere they appointed eight leaders for their party, with officers, and\r\nother regulations to ensure influence and respect; so that the city\r\npossessed two governments, and was under the direction of two distinct\r\npowers. These new leaders determined that Eight, elected from their\r\ntrades, should constantly reside in the palace with the Signory, and\r\nthat whatever the Signory should determine must be confirmed by them\r\nbefore it became law. They took from Salvestro de' Medici and Michael\r\ndi Lando the whole of what their former decrees had granted them, and\r\ndistributed to many of their party offices and emoluments to enable them\r\nto support their dignity. These resolutions being passed, to render them\r\nvalid they sent two of their body to the Signory, to insist on their\r\nbeing confirmed by the Council, with an intimation, that if not granted\r\nthey would be vindicated by force. This deputation, with amazing\r\naudacity and surpassing presumption, explained their commission to the\r\nSignory, upbraided the Gonfalonier with the dignity they had conferred\r\nupon him, the honor they had done him, and with the ingratitude and want\r\nof respect he had shown toward them. Coming to threats toward the end of\r\ntheir discourse, Michael could not endure their arrogance, and sensible\r\nrather of the dignity of the office he held than of the meanness of his\r\norigin, determined by extraordinary means to punish such extraordinary\r\ninsolence, and drawing the sword with which he was girt, seriously\r\nwounded, and cause them to be seized and imprisoned.\r\n\r\nWhen the fact became known, the multitude were filled with rage, and\r\nthinking that by their arms they might ensure what without them they\r\nhad failed to effect, they seized their weapons and with the utmost\r\nfury resolved to force the Signory to consent to their wishes. Michael,\r\nsuspecting what would happen, determined to be prepared, for he knew his\r\ncredit rather required him to be first to the attack than to wait the\r\napproach of the enemy, or, like his predecessors, dishonor both the\r\npalace and himself by flight. He therefore drew together a good number\r\nof citizens (for many began to see their error), mounted on horseback,\r\nand followed by crowds of armed men, proceeded to Santa Maria Novella,\r\nto encounter his adversaries. The plebeians, who as before observed\r\nwere influenced by a similar desire, had set out about the same time as\r\nMichael, and it happened that as each took a different route, they did\r\nnot meet in their way, and Michael, upon his return, found the piazza in\r\ntheir possession. The contest was now for the palace, and joining in the\r\nfight, he soon vanquished them, drove part of them out of the city,\r\nand compelled the rest to throw down their arms and escape or conceal\r\nthemselves, as well as they could. Having thus gained the victory, the\r\ntumults were composed, solely by the talents of the Gonfalonier, who in\r\ncourage, prudence, and generosity surpassed every other citizen of his\r\ntime, and deserves to be enumerated among the glorious few who have\r\ngreatly benefited their country; for had he possessed either malice or\r\nambition, the republic would have been completely ruined, and the city\r\nmust have fallen under greater tyranny than that of the duke of Athens.\r\nBut his goodness never allowed a thought to enter his mind opposed to\r\nthe universal welfare: his prudence enabled him to conduct affairs in\r\nsuch a manner, that a great majority of his own faction reposed the most\r\nentire confidence in him; and he kept the rest in awe by the influence\r\nof his authority. These qualities subdued the plebeians, and opened the\r\neyes of the superior artificers, who considered how great must be the\r\nfolly of those, who having overcome the pride of the nobility, could\r\nendure to submit to the nauseous rule of the rabble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nNew regulations for the elections of the Signory--Confusion in the\r\nCity--Piero degli Albizzi and other citizens condemned to death--The\r\nFlorentines alarmed by the approach of Charles of Durazzo--The\r\nmeasures adopted in consequence thereof--Insolent Conduct of Giorgio\r\nScali--Benedetto Alberti--Giorgio Scali beheaded.\r\n\r\nBy the time Michael di Lando had subdued the plebeians, the new Signory\r\nwas drawn, and among those who composed it, were two persons of such\r\nbase and mean condition, that the desire increased in the minds of the\r\npeople to be freed from the ignominy into which they had fallen; and\r\nwhen, upon the first of September, the new Signory entered office and\r\nthe retiring members were still in the palace, the piazza being full of\r\narmed men, a tumultuous cry arose from the midst of them, that none\r\nof the lowest of the people should hold office among the Signory. The\r\nobnoxious two were withdrawn accordingly. The name of one was Il Tira,\r\nof the other Baroccio, and in their stead were elected Giorgio Scali\r\nand Francesco di Michele. The company of the lowest trade was also\r\ndissolved, and its members deprived of office, except Michael di Lando,\r\nLorenzo di Puccio and a few others of better quality. The honors of\r\ngovernment were divided into two parts, one of which was assigned to the\r\nsuperior trades, the other to the inferior; except that the latter were\r\nto furnish five Signors, and the former only four. The Gonfalonier was\r\nto be chosen alternately from each.\r\n\r\nThe government thus composed, restored peace to the city for the\r\ntime; but though the republic was rescued from the power of the lowest\r\nplebeians, the inferior trades were still more influential than the\r\nnobles of the people, who, however, were obliged to submit for the\r\ngratification of the trades, of whose favor they wished to deprive the\r\nplebeians. The new establishment was supported by all who wished the\r\ncontinued subjugation of those who, under the name of the Guelphic\r\nparty, had practiced such excessive violence against the citizens. And\r\nas among others, thus disposed, were Giorgio Scali, Benedetto Alberti,\r\nSalvestro di Medici, and Tommaso Strozzi, these four almost became\r\nprinces of the city. This state of the public mind strengthened the\r\ndivisions already commenced between the nobles of the people, and the\r\nminor artificers, by the ambition of the Ricci and the Albizzi; from\r\nwhich, as at different times very serious effects arose, and as they\r\nwill hereafter be frequently mentioned, we shall call the former\r\nthe popular party, the latter the plebeian. This condition of things\r\ncontinued three years, during which many were exiled and put to death;\r\nfor the government lived in constant apprehension, knowing that both\r\nwithin and without the city many were dissatisfied with them. Those\r\nwithin, either attempted or were suspected of attempting every day some\r\nnew project against them; and those without, being under no restraint,\r\nwere continually, by means of some prince or republic, spreading reports\r\ntending to increase the disaffection.\r\n\r\nGianozzo da Salerno was at this time in Bologna. He held a command under\r\nCharles of Durazzo, a descendant of the kings of Naples, who, designing\r\nto undertake the conquest of the dominions of Queen Giovanna, retained\r\nhis captain in that city, with the concurrence of Pope Urban, who was at\r\nenmity with the queen. Many Florentine emigrants were also at Bologna,\r\nin close correspondence with him and Charles. This caused the rulers in\r\nFlorence to live in continual alarm, and induced them to lend a willing\r\near to any calumnies against the suspected. While in this disturbed\r\nstate of feeling, it was disclosed to the government that Gianozzo da\r\nSalerno was about to march to Florence with the emigrants, and that\r\ngreat numbers of those within were to rise in arms, and deliver the city\r\nto him. Upon this information many were accused, the principal of whom\r\nwere Piero degli Albizzi and Carlo Strozzi: and after these Cipriano\r\nMangione, Jacopo Sacchetti, Donato Barbadori, Filippo Strozzi, and\r\nGiovanni Anselmi, the whole of whom, except Carlo Strozzi who fled, were\r\nmade prisoners; and the Signory, to prevent any one from taking arms\r\nin their favor, appointed Tommaso Strozzi and Benedetto Alberti with\r\na strong armed force, to guard the city. The arrested citizens were\r\nexamined, and although nothing was elicited against them sufficient to\r\ninduce the Capitano to find them guilty, their enemies excited the minds\r\nof the populace to such a degree of outrageous and overwhelming fury\r\nagainst them, that they were condemned to death, as it were, by force.\r\nNor was the greatness of his family, or his former reputation of any\r\nservice to Piero degli Albizzi, who had once been, of all the citizens,\r\nthe man most feared and honored. Some one, either as a friend to\r\nrender him wise in his prosperity, or an enemy to threaten him with the\r\nfickleness of fortune, had upon the occasion of his making a feast for\r\nmany citizens, sent him a silver bowl full of sweetmeats, among which\r\na large nail was found, and being seen by many present, was taken for a\r\nhint to him to fix the wheel of fortune, which, having conveyed him to\r\nthe top, must if the rotation continued, also bring him to the bottom.\r\nThis interpretation was verified, first by his ruin, and afterward by\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nAfter this execution the city was full of consternation, for both\r\nvictors and vanquished were alike in fear; but the worst effects arose\r\nfrom the apprehensions of those possessing the management of affairs;\r\nfor every accident, however trivial, caused them to commit fresh\r\noutrages, either by condemnations, admonitions, or banishment of\r\ncitizens; to which must be added, as scarcely less pernicious, the\r\nfrequent new laws and regulations which were made for defense of the\r\ngovernment, all of which were put in execution to the injury of those\r\nopposed to their faction. They appointed forty-six persons, who,\r\nwith the Signory, were to purge the republic of all suspected by the\r\ngovernment. They admonished thirty-nine citizens, ennobled many of the\r\npeople, and degraded many nobles to the popular rank. To strengthen\r\nthemselves against external foes, they took into their pay John\r\nHawkwood, an Englishman of great military reputation, who had long\r\nserved the pope and others in Italy. Their fears from without were\r\nincreased by a report that several bodies of men were being assembled\r\nby Charles of Durazzo for the conquest of Naples, and many Florentine\r\nemigrants were said to have joined him. Against these dangers, in\r\naddition to the forces which had been raised, large sums of money were\r\nprovided; and Charles, having arrived at Arezzo, obtained from the\r\nFlorentines 40,000 ducats, and promised he would not molest them. His\r\nenterprise was immediately prosecuted, and having occupied the kingdom\r\nof Naples, he sent Queen Giovanna a prisoner into Hungary. This victory\r\nrenewed the fears of those who managed the affairs of Florence, for\r\nthey could not persuade themselves that their money would have a greater\r\ninfluence on the king's mind than the friendship which his house had\r\nlong retained for the Guelphs, whom they so grievously oppressed.\r\n\r\nThis suspicion increasing, multiplied oppressions; which again, instead\r\nof diminishing the suspicion, augmented it; so that most men lived\r\nin the utmost discontent. To this the insolence of Giorgio Scali\r\nand Tommaso Strozzi (who by their popular influence overawed the\r\nmagistrates) also contributed, for the rulers were apprehensive that by\r\nthe power these men possessed with the plebeians they could set them at\r\ndefiance; and hence it is evident that not only to good men, but even to\r\nthe seditious, this government appeared tyrannical and violent. To put a\r\nperiod to the outrageous conduct of Giorgio, it happened that a servant\r\nof his accused Giovanni di Cambio of practices against the state, but\r\nthe Capitano declared him innocent. Upon this, the judge determined to\r\npunish the accuser with the same penalties that the accused would have\r\nincurred had he been guilty, but Giorgio Scali, unable to save him\r\neither by his authority or entreaties, obtained the assistance of\r\nTommaso Strozzi, and with a multitude of armed men, set the informer\r\nat liberty and plundered the palace of the Capitano, who was obliged\r\nto save himself by flight. This act excited such great and universal\r\nanimosity against him, that his enemies began to hope they would be able\r\nto effect his ruin, and also to rescue the city from the power of\r\nthe plebeians, who for three years had held her under their arrogant\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nTo the realization of this design the Capitano greatly contributed, for\r\nthe tumult having subsided, he presented himself before the signors,\r\nand said \"He had cheerfully undertaken the office to which they had\r\nappointed him, for he thought he should serve upright men who would take\r\narms for the defense of justice, and not impede its progress. But now\r\nthat he had seen and had experience of the proceedings of the city, and\r\nthe manner in which affairs were conducted, that dignity which he had\r\nvoluntarily assumed with the hope of acquiring honor and emolument, he\r\nnow more willingly resigned, to escape from the losses and danger to\r\nwhich he found himself exposed.\" The complaint of the Capitano was heard\r\nwith the utmost attention by the Signory, who promising to remunerate\r\nhim for the injury he had suffered and provide for his future security,\r\nhe was satisfied. Some of them then obtained an interview with certain\r\ncitizens who were thought to be lovers of the common good, and least\r\nsuspected by the state; and in conjunction with these, it was concluded\r\nthat the present was a favorable opportunity for rescuing the city from\r\nGiorgio and the plebeians, the last outrage he had committed having\r\ncompletely alienated the great body of the people from him. They judged\r\nit best to profit by the occasion before the excitement had abated, for\r\nthey knew that the favor of the mob is often gained or lost by the\r\nmost trifling circumstance; and more certainly to insure success, they\r\ndetermined, if possible, to obtain the concurrence of Benedetto Alberti,\r\nfor without it they considered their enterprise to be dangerous.\r\n\r\nBenedetto was one of the richest citizens, a man of unassuming manners,\r\nan ardent lover of the liberties of his country, and one to whom\r\ntyrannical measures were in the highest degree offensive; so that he was\r\neasily induced to concur in their views and consent to Giorgio's ruin.\r\nHis enmity against the nobles of the people and the Guelphs, and\r\nhis friendship for the plebeians, were caused by the insolence and\r\ntyrannical proceedings of the former; but finding that the plebeians had\r\nsoon become quite as insolent, he quickly separated himself from them;\r\nand the injuries committed by them against the citizens were done wholly\r\nwithout his consent. So that the same motives which made him join the\r\nplebeians induced him to leave them.\r\n\r\nHaving gained Benedetto and the leaders of the trades to their side,\r\nthey provided themselves with arms and made Giorgio prisoner. Tommaso\r\nfled. The next day Giorgio was beheaded; which struck so great a\r\nterror into his party, that none ventured to express the slightest\r\ndisapprobation, but each seemed anxious to be foremost in defense of the\r\nmeasure. On being led to execution, in the presence of that people who\r\nonly a short time before had idolized him, Giorgio complained of his\r\nhard fortune, and the malignity of those citizens who, having done him\r\nan undeserved injury, had compelled him to honor and support a mob,\r\npossessing neither faith nor gratitude. Observing Benedetto Alberti\r\namong those who had armed themselves for the preservation of order, he\r\nsaid, \"Do you, too, consent, Benedetto, that this injury shall be done\r\nto me? Were I in your place and you in mine, I would take care that no\r\none should injure you. I tell you, however, this day is the end of my\r\ntroubles and the beginning of yours.\" He then blamed himself for having\r\nconfided too much in a people who may be excited and inflamed by every\r\nword, motion, and breath of suspicion. With these complaints he died in\r\nthe midst of his armed enemies, delighted at his fall. Some of his most\r\nintimate associates were also put to death, and their bodies dragged\r\nabout by the mob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nConfusion and riots in the city--Reform of government in opposition to\r\nthe plebeians--Injuries done to those who favored the plebeians--Michael\r\ndi Lando banished--Benedetto Alberti hated by the Signory--Fears\r\nexcited by the coming of Louis of Anjou--The Florentines purchase\r\nArezzo--Benedetto Alberti becomes suspected and is banished--His\r\ndiscourse upon leaving the city--Other citizens banished and\r\nadmonished--War with Giovanni Galeazzo, duke of Milan.\r\n\r\nThe death of Giorgio caused very great excitement; many took arms at\r\nthe execution in favor of the Signory and the Capitano; and many others,\r\neither for ambition or as a means for their own safety, did the same.\r\nThe city was full of conflicting parties, who each had a particular end\r\nin view, and wished to carry it into effect before they disarmed. The\r\nancient nobility, called the GREAT, could not bear to be deprived\r\nof public honors; for the recovery of which they used their utmost\r\nexertions, and earnestly desired that authority might be restored to the\r\nCapitani di Parte. The nobles of the people and the major trades were\r\ndiscontented at the share the minor trades and lowest of the people\r\npossessed in the government; while the minor trades were desirous of\r\nincreasing their influence, and the lowest people were apprehensive\r\nof losing the companies of their trades and the authority which these\r\nconferred.\r\n\r\nSuch opposing views occasioned Florence, during a year, to be disturbed\r\nby many riots. Sometimes the nobles of the people took arms; sometimes\r\nthe major and sometimes the minor trades and the lowest of the people;\r\nand it often happened that, though in different parts, all were at once\r\nin insurrection. Hence many conflicts took place between the different\r\nparties or with the forces of the palace; for the Signory sometimes\r\nyielding, and at other times resisting, adopted such remedies as they\r\ncould for these numerous evils. At length, after two assemblies of the\r\npeople, and many Balias appointed for the reformation of the city; after\r\nmuch toil, labor, and imminent danger, a government was appointed,\r\nby which all who had been banished since Salvestro de' Medici was\r\nGonfalonier were restored. They who had acquired distinctions or\r\nemoluments by the Balia of 1378 were deprived of them. The honors of\r\ngovernment were restored to the Guelphic party; the two new Companies of\r\nthe Trades were dissolved, and all who had been subject to them assigned\r\nto their former companies. The minor trades were not allowed to elect\r\nthe Gonfalonier of Justice, their share of honors was reduced from a\r\nhalf to a third; and those of the highest rank were withdrawn from them\r\naltogether. Thus the nobles of the people and the Guelphs repossessed\r\nthemselves of the government, which was lost by the plebeians after it\r\nhad been in their possession from 1378 to 1381, when these changes took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe new establishment was not less injurious to the citizens, or less\r\ntroublesome at its commencement than that of the plebeians had been; for\r\nmany of the nobles of the people, who had distinguished themselves as\r\ndefenders of the plebeians, were banished, with a great number of the\r\nleaders of the latter, among whom was Michael di Lando; nor could all\r\nthe benefits conferred upon the city by his authority, when in danger\r\nfrom the lawless mob, save him from the rabid fury of the party that was\r\nnow in power. His good offices evidently excited little gratitude in\r\nhis countrymen. The neglect of their benefactors is an error into which\r\nprinces and republics frequently fall; and hence mankind, alarmed by\r\nsuch examples, as soon as they begin to perceive the ingratitude of\r\ntheir rulers, set themselves against them.\r\n\r\nAs these banishments and executions had always been offensive to\r\nBenedetto Alberti, they continued to disgust him, and he censured them\r\nboth publicly and privately. The leaders of the government began to\r\nfear him, for they considered him one of the most earnest friends of\r\nthe plebeians, and thought he had not consented to the death of Giorgio\r\nScali from disapprobation of his proceeding, but that he might be left\r\nhimself without a rival in the government. His discourse and his conduct\r\nalike served to increase their suspicions, so that all the ruling party\r\nhad their eyes upon him, and eagerly sought an opportunity of crushing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDuring this state of things, external affairs were not of serious\r\nimportance, for some which ensued were productive of apprehension rather\r\nthan of injury. At this time Louis of Anjou came into Italy, to recover\r\nthe kingdom of Naples for Queen Giovanna, and drive out Charles of\r\nDurazzo. His coming terrified the Florentines; for Charles, according\r\nto the custom of old friends, demanded their assistance, and Louis,\r\nlike those who seek new alliances, required their neutrality. The\r\nFlorentines, that they might seem to comply with the request of Louis,\r\nand at the same time assist Charles, discharged from their service\r\nSir John Hawkwood, and transferred him to that of Pope Urban, who was\r\nfriendly to Charles; but this deceit was at once detected, and Louis\r\nconsidered himself greatly injured by the Florentines. While the war\r\nwas carried on between Louis and Charles in Puglia, new forces were sent\r\nfrom France in aid of Louis, and on arriving in Tuscany, were by the\r\nemigrants of Arezzo conducted to that city, and took it from those who\r\nheld possession for Charles. And when they were about to change the\r\ngovernment of Florence, as they had already done that of Arezzo, Louis\r\ndied, and the order of things in Puglia and in Tuscany was changed\r\naccordingly; for Charles secured the kingdom, which had been all but\r\nlost, and the Florentines, who were apprehensive for their own city,\r\npurchased Arezzo from those who held it for Louis. Charles, having\r\nsecured Puglia, went to take possession of Hungary, to which he was\r\nheir, leaving, with his wife, his children Ladislaus and Giovanna, who\r\nwere yet infants. He took possession of Hungary, but was soon after\r\nslain there.\r\n\r\nAs great rejoicings were made in Florence on account of this acquisition\r\nas ever took place in any city for a real victory, which served to\r\nexhibit the public and private wealth of the people, many families\r\nendeavoring to vie with the state itself in displays of magnificence.\r\nThe Alberti surpassed all others; the tournaments and exhibitions made\r\nby them were rather suitable for a sovereign prince than for any private\r\nindividuals. These things increased the envy with which the family was\r\nregarded, and being joined with suspicions which the state entertained\r\nof Benedetto, were the causes of his ruin. The rulers could not endure\r\nhim, for it appeared as if, at any moment, something might occur,\r\nwhich, with the favor of his friends, would enable him to recover\r\nhis authority, and drive them out of the city. While in this state of\r\nsuspicion and jealousy, it happened that while he was Gonfalonier of the\r\nCompanies, his son-in-law, Filippo Magalotti, was drawn Gonfalonier of\r\nJustice; and this circumstance increased the fears of the government,\r\nfor they thought it would strengthen Benedetto's influence, and place\r\nthe state in the greater peril. Anxious to provide a remedy, without\r\ncreating much disturbance, they induced Bese Magalotti, his relative and\r\nenemy, to signify to the Signory that Filippo, not having attained the\r\nage required for the exercise of that office, neither could nor ought to\r\nhold it.\r\n\r\nThe question was examined by the signors, and part of them out of\r\nhatred, others in order to avoid disunion among themselves, declared\r\nFilippo ineligible to the dignity, and in his stead was drawn Bardo\r\nMancini, who was quite opposed to the plebeian interests, and an\r\ninveterate foe of Benedetto. This man, having entered upon the duties\r\nof his office, created a _Balia_ for the reformation of the state, which\r\nbanished Benedetto Alberti and admonished all the rest of his family\r\nexcept Antonio. Before his departure, Benedetto called them together,\r\nand observing their melancholy demeanor, said, \"You see, my fathers, and\r\nyou the elders of our house, how fortune has ruined me and threatened\r\nyou. I am not surprised at this, neither ought you to be so, for it\r\nalways happens thus to those who among a multitude of the wicked, wish\r\nto act rightly, and endeavor to sustain, what the many seek to destroy.\r\nThe love of my country made me take part with Salvestro de Medici and\r\nafterward separated me from Giorgio Scali. The same cause compelled me\r\nto detest those who now govern, who having none to punish them, will\r\nallow no one to reprove their misdeeds. I am content that my banishment\r\nshould deliver them from the fears they entertain, not of me only, but\r\nof all who they think perceives or is acquainted wit their tyrannical\r\nand wicked proceedings; and they have aimed their first blow at me, in\r\norder the more easily to oppress you. I do not grieve on my own account;\r\nfor those honors which my country bestowed upon me while free, she\r\ncannot in her slavery take from me; and the recollection of my past\r\nlife will always give me greater pleasure than the pain imparted by the\r\nsorrows of exile. I deeply regret that my country is left a prey to the\r\ngreediness and pride of the few who keep her in subjection. I grieve for\r\nyou; for I fear that the evils which this day cease to affect me, and\r\ncommence with you, will pursue you with even greater malevolence than\r\nthey have me. Comfort, then, each other; resolve to bear up against\r\nevery misfortune, and conduct yourselves in such a manner, that when\r\ndisasters befall you (and there will be many), every one may know they\r\nhave come upon you undeservedly.\" Not to give a worse impression of\r\nhis virtue abroad than he had done at home, he made a journey to the\r\nsepulcher of Christ, and while upon his return, died at Rhodes. His\r\nremains were brought to Florence, and interred with all possible honors,\r\nby those who had persecuted him, when alive, with every species of\r\ncalumny and injustice.\r\n\r\nThe family of the Alberti was not the only injured party during these\r\ntroubles of the city; for many others were banished and admonished. Of\r\nthe former were Piero Benini, Matteo Alderotti, Giovanni and Francesco\r\ndel Bene, Giovanni Benci, Andrea Adimari, and with them many members of\r\nthe minor trades. Of the admonished were the Covini, Benini, Rinucci,\r\nFormiconi, Corbizzi, Manelli, and Alderotti. It was customary to create\r\nthe Balia for a limited time; and when the citizens elected had effected\r\nthe purpose of their appointment, they resigned the office from motives\r\nof good feeling and decency, although the time allowed might not have\r\nexpired. In conformity with this laudable practice, the Balia of that\r\nperiod, supposing they had accomplished all that was expected of them,\r\nwished to retire; but when the multitude were acquainted with their\r\nintention, they ran armed to the palace, and insisted, that before\r\nresigning their power, many other persons should be banished and\r\nadmonished. This greatly displeased the signors; but without disclosing\r\nthe extent of their displeasure, they contrived to amuse the multitude\r\nwith promises, till they had assembled a sufficient body of armed men,\r\nand then took such measures, that fear induced the people to lay aside\r\nthe weapons which madness had led them to take up. Nevertheless, in some\r\ndegree to gratify the fury of the mob, and to reduce the authority of\r\nthe plebeian trades, it was provided, that as the latter had previously\r\npossessed a third of the honors, they should in future have only a\r\nfourth. That there might always be two of the signors particularly\r\ndevoted to the government, they gave authority to the Gonfalonier of\r\nJustice, and four others, to form a ballot-purse of select citizens,\r\nfrom which, in every Signory, two should be drawn.\r\n\r\nThis government from its establishment in 1381, till the alterations\r\nnow made, had continued six years; and the internal peace of the city\r\nremained undisturbed until 1393. During this time, Giovanni Galeazzo\r\nVisconti, usually called the Count of Virtú, imprisoned his uncle\r\nBernabo, and thus became sovereign of the whole of Lombardy. As he had\r\nbecome duke of Milan by fraud, he designed to make himself king of Italy\r\nby force. In 1391 he commenced a spirited attack upon the Florentines;\r\nbut such various changes occurred in the course of the war, that he\r\nwas frequently in greater danger than the Florentines themselves, who,\r\nthough they made a brave and admirable defense, for a republic, must\r\nhave been ruined, if he had survived. As it was, the result was attended\r\nwith infinitely less evil than their fears of so powerful an enemy had\r\nled them to apprehend; for the duke having taken Bologna, Pisa, Perugia,\r\nand Sienna, and prepared a diadem with which to be crowned king of Italy\r\nat Florence, died before he had tasted the fruit of his victories, or\r\nthe Florentines began to feel the effect of their disasters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMaso degli Albizzi--His violence excites the anger of the people--They\r\nhave recourse to Veri de' Medici--The modesty of Veri--He refuses to\r\nassume the dignity of prince, and appeases the people--Discourse of\r\nVeri to the Signory--The banished Florentines endeavor to return--They\r\nsecretly enter the city and raise a tumult--Some of them slain, others\r\ntaken to the church of St. Reparata--A conspiracy of exiles supported\r\nby the duke of Milan--The conspiracy discovered and the parties\r\npunished--Various enterprises of the Florentines--Taking of Pisa--War\r\nwith the king of Naples--Acquisition of Cortona.\r\n\r\nDuring the war with the duke of Milan the office of Gonfalonier of\r\nJustice fell to Maso degli Albizzi, who by the death of Piero in 1379,\r\nhad become the inveterate enemy of the Alberti: and as party feeling is\r\nincapable either of repose or abatement, he determined, notwithstanding\r\nBenedetto had died in exile, that before the expiration of his\r\nmagistracy, he would revenge himself on the remainder of that family.\r\nHe seized the opportunity afforded by a person, who on being examined\r\nrespecting correspondence maintained with the rebels, accused Andrea and\r\nAlberto degli Alberti of such practices. They were immediately arrested,\r\nwhich so greatly excited the people, that the Signory, having provided\r\nthemselves with an armed force, called the citizens to a general\r\nassembly or parliament, and appointed a Balia, by whose authority many\r\nwere banished, and a new ballot for the offices of government was made.\r\nAmong the banished were nearly all the Alberti; many members of the\r\ntrades were admonished, and some put to death. Stung by these numerous\r\ninjuries, the trades and the lowest of the people rose in arms,\r\nconsidering themselves despoiled both of honor and life. One body of\r\nthem assembled in the piazza; another ran to the house of Veri de'\r\nMedici, who, after the death of Salvestro, was head of the family. The\r\nSignory, in order to appease those who came to the piazza or court of\r\nthe palace, gave them for leaders, with the ensigns of the Guelphs\r\nand of the people in their hands, Rinaldo Gianfigliazzi, and Donato\r\nAcciajuoli, both men of the popular class, and more attached to the\r\ninterests of the plebeians than any other. Those who went to the house\r\nof Veri de' Medici, begged that he would be pleased to undertake the\r\ngovernment, and free them from the tyranny of those citizens who were\r\ndestroying the peace and safety of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed by all who have written concerning the events of this\r\nperiod, that if Veri had had more ambition than integrity he might\r\nwithout any impediment have become prince of the city; for the unfeeling\r\ntreatment which, whether right or wrong, had been inflicted upon the\r\ntrades and their friends, had so excited the minds of men to vengeance,\r\nthat all they required was some one to be their leader. Nor were there\r\nwanting those who could inform him of the state of public feeling; for\r\nAntonio de' Medici with whom he had for some time been upon terms of\r\nmost intimate friendship, endeavored to persuade him to undertake the\r\ngovernment of the republic. To this Veri replied: \"Thy menaces when thou\r\nwert my enemy, never alarmed me; nor shall thy counsel, now when thou\r\nart my friend, do me any harm.\" Then, turning toward the multitude,\r\nhe bade them be of good cheer; for he would be their defender, if they\r\nwould allow themselves to be advised by him. He then went, accompanied\r\nby a great number of citizens, to the piazza, and proceeded directly to\r\nthe audience chamber of the Signory, whom he addressed to this effect:\r\nThat he could not regret having lived so as to gain the love of the\r\nFlorentines; but he was sorry they had formed an opinion of him which\r\nhis past life had not warranted; for never having done anything that\r\ncould be construed as either factious or ambitious, he could not imagine\r\nhow it had happened, that they should think him willing to stir up\r\nstrife as a discontented person, or usurp the government of his country\r\nlike an ambitious one. He therefore begged that the infatuation of the\r\nmultitude might not injure him in their estimation; for, to the utmost\r\nof his power, their authority should be restored. He then recommended\r\nthem to use good fortune with moderation; for it would be much better to\r\nenjoy an imperfect victory with safety to the city, than a complete\r\none at her ruin. The Signory applauded Veri's conduct; begged he would\r\nendeavor to prevent recourse to arms, and promised that what he and\r\nthe other citizens might deem most advisable should be done. Veri then\r\nreturned to the piazza, where the people who had followed him were\r\njoined by those led by Donato and Rinaldo, and informed the united\r\ncompanies that he had found the Signory most kindly disposed toward\r\nthem; that many things had been taken into consideration, which\r\nthe shortness of time, and the absence of the magistrates, rendered\r\nincapable of being finished. He therefore begged they would lay down\r\ntheir arms and obey the Signory; assuring them that humility would\r\nprevail rather than pride, entreaties rather than threats; and if\r\nthey would take his advice, their privileges and security would remain\r\nunimpaired. He thus induced them to return peaceably to their homes.\r\n\r\nThe disturbance having subsided, the Signory armed the piazza,\r\nenrolled 2,000 of the most trusty citizens, who were divided equally\r\nby Gonfalons, and ordered to be in readiness to give their assistance\r\nwhenever required; and they forbade the use of arms to all who were\r\nnot thus enrolled. Having adopted these precautionary measures, they\r\nbanished and put to death many of those members of the trades who had\r\nshown the greatest audacity in the late riots; and to invest the office\r\nof Gonfalonier of Justice with more authoritative majesty, they ordered\r\nthat no one should be eligible to it, under forty-five years of age.\r\nMany other provisions for the defense of the state were made, which\r\nappeared intolerable to those against whom they were directed, and were\r\nodious even to the friends of the Signory themselves, for they could not\r\nbelieve a government to be either good or secure, which needed so much\r\nviolence for its defense, a violence excessively offensive, not only to\r\nthose of the Alberti who remained in the city, and to the Medici, who\r\nfelt themselves injured by these proceedings, but also to many others.\r\nThe first who attempted resistance was Donato, the son of Jacopo\r\nAcciajuoli, who thought of great authority, and the superior rather than\r\nthe equal of Maso degli Albizzi (who on account of the events which took\r\nplace while he was Gonfalonier of Justice, was almost at the head of the\r\nrepublic), could not enjoy repose amid such general discontent, or,\r\nlike many others, convert social evils to his own private advantage,\r\nand therefore resolved to attempt the restoration of the exiles to their\r\ncountry, or at least their offices to the admonished. He went from one\r\nto another, disseminating his views, showing that the people would not\r\nbe satisfied, or the ferment of parties subside, without the changes\r\nhe proposed; and declared that if he were in the Signory, he would soon\r\ncarry them into effect. In human affairs, delay causes tedium, and haste\r\ndanger. To avoid what was tedious, Donato Acciajuoli resolved to attempt\r\nwhat involved danger. Michele Acciajuoli his relative, and Niccolo\r\nRicoveri his friend, were of the Signory. This seemed to Donato a\r\nconjuncture of circumstances too favorable to be lost, and he requested\r\nthey would propose a law to the councils, which would include the\r\nrestoration of the citizens. They, at his entreaty, spoke about the\r\nmatter to their associates, who replied, that it was improper to attempt\r\nany innovation in which the advantage was doubtful and the danger\r\ncertain. Upon this, Donato, having in vain tried all other means he\r\ncould think of, excited with anger, gave them to understand that since\r\nthey would not allow the city to be governed with peaceful measures,\r\nhe would try what could be done with arms. These words gave so great\r\noffense, that being communicated to the heads of the government, Donato\r\nwas summoned, and having appeared, the truth was proven by those to whom\r\nhe had intrusted the message, and he was banished to Barletta. Alamanno\r\nand Antonio de' Medici were also banished, and all those of that\r\nfamily, who were descended from Alamanno, with many who, although of\r\nthe inferior artificers, possessed influence with the plebeians. These\r\nevents took place two years after the reform of government effected by\r\nMaso degli Albizzi.\r\n\r\nAt this time many discontented citizens were at home, and others\r\nbanished in the adjoining states. Of the latter there lived at Bologna\r\nPicchio Cavicciulli, Tommaso de' Ricci, Antonio de' Medici, Benedetto\r\ndegli Spini, Antonio Girolami, Cristofano di Carlone, and two others\r\nof the lowest order, all bold young men, and resolved upon returning to\r\ntheir country at any hazard. These were secretly told by Piggiello and\r\nBaroccio Cavicciulli, who, being admonished, lived in Florence, that\r\nif they came to the city they should be concealed in their house; from\r\nwhich they might afterward issue, slay Maso degli Albizzi, and call\r\nthe people to arms, who, full of discontent, would willingly arise,\r\nparticularly as they would be supported by the Ricci, Adimari, Medici,\r\nManelli, and many other families. Excited with these hopes, on the\r\nfourth of August, 1397, they came to Florence, and having entered\r\nunobserved according to their arrangement, they sent one of their party\r\nto watch Maso, designing with his death to raise the people. Maso was\r\nobserved to leave his house and proceed to that of an apothecary, near\r\nthe church of San Pietro Maggiore, which he entered. The man who went\r\nto watch him ran to give information to the other conspirators, who took\r\ntheir arms and hastened to the house of the apothecary, but found\r\nthat Maso had gone. However, undaunted with the failure of their first\r\nattempt, they proceeded to the Old Market, where they slew one of the\r\nadverse party, and with loud cries of \"people, arms, liberty, and death\r\nto the tyrants,\" directed their course toward the New Market, and at the\r\nend of the Calimala slew another. Pursuing their course with the same\r\ncries, and finding no one join them in arms, they stopped at the Loggia\r\nNighittosa, where, from an elevated situation, being surrounded with\r\na great multitude, assembled to look on rather than assist them, they\r\nexhorted the men to take arms and deliver themselves from the slavery\r\nwhich weighed so heavily upon them; declaring that the complaints of the\r\ndiscontented in the city, rather than their own grievances, had induced\r\nthem to attempt their deliverance. They had heard that many prayed to\r\nGod for an opportunity of avenging themselves, and vowed they would\r\nuse it whenever they found anyone to conduct them; but now, when the\r\nfavorable circumstances occurred, and they found those who were ready to\r\nlead them, they stared at each other like men stupefied, and would wait\r\ntill those who were endeavoring to recover for them their liberty\r\nwere slain, and their own chains more strongly riveted upon them; they\r\nwondered that those who were wont to take arms upon slight occasions,\r\nremained unmoved under the pressure of so many and so great evils; and\r\nthat they could willingly suffer such numbers of their fellow-citizens\r\nto be banished, so many admonished, when it was in their power to\r\nrestore the banished to their country, and the admonished to the honors\r\nof the state. These words, although full of truth, produced no effect\r\nupon those to whom they were addressed; for they were either restrained\r\nby their fears, or, on account of the two murders which had been\r\ncommitted, disgusted with the parties. Thus the movers of the tumult,\r\nfinding that neither words or deeds had force sufficient to stir anyone,\r\nsaw, when too late, how dangerous a thing it is to attempt to set a\r\npeople free who are resolved to be slaves; and, despairing of success,\r\nthey withdrew to the temple of Santa Reparata, where, not to save their\r\nlives, but to defer the moment of their deaths, they shut themselves up.\r\nUpon the first rumor of the affair, the Signory being in fear, armed and\r\nsecured the palace; but when the facts of the case were understood,\r\nthe parties known, and whither they had betaken themselves, their fears\r\nsubsided, and they sent the Capitano with a sufficient body of armed\r\nmen to secure them. The gates of the temple were forced without much\r\ntrouble; part of the conspirators were slain defending themselves;\r\nthe remainder were made prisoners and examined, but none were found\r\nimplicated in the affair except Baroccio and Piggiello Cavicciulli, who\r\nwere put to death with them.\r\n\r\nShortly after this event, another occurred of greater importance. The\r\nFlorentines were, as we have before remarked, at war with the duke of\r\nMilan, who, finding that with merely open force he could not overcome\r\nthem, had recourse to secret practices, and with the assistance of the\r\nexiles of whom Lombardy was full, he formed a plot to which many in the\r\ncity were accessory. It was resolved by the conspirators that most of\r\nthe emigrants, capable of bearing arms, should set out from the places\r\nnearest Florence, enter the city by the river Arno, and with their\r\nfriends hasten to the residences of the chiefs of the government; and\r\nhaving slain them, reform the republic according to their own will. Of\r\nthe conspirators within the city, was one of the Ricci named Samminiato;\r\nand as it often happens in treacherous practices, few are insufficient\r\nto effect the purpose of the plot, and among many secrecy cannot be\r\npreserved, so while Samminiato was in quest of associates, he found an\r\naccuser. He confided the affair to Salvestro Cavicciulli, whose wrongs\r\nand those of his friends were thought sufficient to make him faithful;\r\nbut he, more influenced by immediate fear than the hope of future\r\nvengeance, discovered the whole affair to the Signory, who, having\r\ncaused Samminiato to be taken, compelled him to tell all the particulars\r\nof the matter. However, none of the conspirators were taken, except\r\nTommaso Davizi, who, coming from Bologna, and unaware of what had\r\noccurred at Florence, was seized immediately upon his arrival. All the\r\nothers had fled immediately upon the apprehension of Samminiato.\r\n\r\nSamminiato and Tommaso having been punished according to their deserts,\r\na Balia was formed of many citizens, which sought the delinquents, and\r\ntook measures for the security of the state. They declared six of the\r\nfamily of the Ricci rebels; also, six of the Alberti; two of the Medici;\r\nthree of the Scali; two of the Strozzi; Bindo Altoviti, Bernado Adimari,\r\nand many others of inferior quality. They admonished all the family\r\nof the Alberti, the Ricci, and the Medici for ten years, except a few\r\nindividuals. Among the Alberti, not admonished, was Antonio, who was\r\nthought to be quiet and peaceable. It happened, however, before all\r\nsuspicion of the conspiracy had ceased, a monk was taken who had been\r\nobserved during its progress to pass frequently between Bologna and\r\nFlorence. He confessed that he had often carried letters to Antonio,\r\nwho was immediately seized, and, though he denied all knowledge of the\r\nmatter from the first, the monk's accusation prevailed, and he was fined\r\nin a considerable sum of money, and banished a distance of three hundred\r\nmiles from Florence. That the Alberti might not constantly place the\r\ncity in jeopardy, every member of the family was banished whose age\r\nexceeded fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThese events took place in the year 1400, and two years afterward, died\r\nGiovanni Galeazzo, duke of Milan, whose death as we have said above, put\r\nan end to the war, which had then continued twelve years. At this time,\r\nthe government having gained greater strength, and being without\r\nenemies external or internal, undertook the conquest of Pisa, and having\r\ngloriously completed it, the peace of the city remained undisturbed\r\nfrom 1400 to 1433, except that in 1412, the Alberti, having crossed the\r\nboundary they were forbidden to pass, a Balia was formed which with new\r\nprovisions fortified the state and punished the offenders with heavy\r\nfines. During this period also, the Florentines made war with Ladislaus,\r\nking of Naples, who finding himself in great danger ceded to them the\r\ncity of Cortona of which he was master; but soon afterward, recovering\r\nhis power, he renewed the war, which became far more disastrous to the\r\nFlorentines than before; and had it not, in 1414, been terminated by his\r\ndeath, as that of Lombardy had been by the death of the duke of Milan,\r\nhe, like the duke, would have brought Florence into great danger of\r\nlosing her liberty. Nor was the war with the king concluded with less\r\ngood fortune than the former; for when he had taken Rome, Sienna, the\r\nwhole of La Marca and Romagna, and had only Florence itself to vanquish,\r\nhe died. Thus death has always been more favorable to the Florentines\r\nthan any other friend, and more potent to save them than their own\r\nvalor. From the time of the king's decease, peace was preserved both at\r\nhome and abroad for eight years, at the end of which, with the wars of\r\nFilippo, duke of Milan, the spirit of faction again broke out, and was\r\nonly appeased by the ruin of that government which continued from 1381\r\nto 1434, had conducted with great glory so many enterprises; acquired\r\nArezzo, Pisa, Cortona, Leghorn, and Monte Pulciano; and would have\r\naccomplished more if the citizens had lived in unity, and had not\r\nrevived former factions; as in the following book will be particularly\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nLicense and Slavery peculiar defects in republican\r\ngovernments--Application of this reflection to the state of\r\nFlorence--Giovanni di Bicci di' Medici re-establishes the authority of\r\nhis family--Filippo Visconti, duke of Milan, endeavors to make amicable\r\narrangements with the Florentines--Their jealousy of him--Precautionary\r\nmeasures against him--War declared--The Florentines are routed by the\r\nducal forces.\r\n\r\nRepublican governments, more especially those imperfectly organized,\r\nfrequently change their rulers and the form of their institutions; not\r\nby the influence of liberty or subjection, as many suppose, but by\r\nthat of slavery and license; for with the nobility or the people, the\r\nministers respectively of slavery or licentiousness, only the name of\r\nliberty is in any estimation, neither of them choosing to be subject\r\neither to magistrates or laws. When, however, a good, wise, and powerful\r\ncitizen appears (which is but seldom), who establishes ordinances\r\ncapable of appeasing or restraining these contending dispositions, so as\r\nto prevent them from doing mischief, then the government may be called\r\nfree, and its institutions firm and secure; for having good laws for its\r\nbasis, and good regulations for carrying them into effect, it needs\r\nnot, like others, the virtue of one man for its maintenance. With such\r\nexcellent laws and institutions, many of those ancient republics, which\r\nwere of long duration, were endowed. But these advantages are, and\r\nalways have been, denied to those which frequently change from tyranny\r\nto license, or the reverse; because, from the powerful enemies which\r\neach condition creates itself, they neither have, nor can possess any\r\nstability; for tyranny cannot please the good, and license is offensive\r\nto the wise: the former may easily be productive of mischief, while the\r\nlatter can scarcely be beneficial; in the former, the insolent have too\r\nmuch authority, and in the latter, the foolish; so that each requires\r\nfor their welfare the virtue and the good fortune of some individual who\r\nmay be removed by death, or become unserviceable by misfortune.\r\n\r\nHence, it appears, that the government which commenced in Florence at\r\nthe death of Giorgio Scali, in 1381, was first sustained by the talents\r\nof Maso degli Albizzi, and then by those of Niccolo da Uzzano. The city\r\nremained tranquil from 1414 to 1422; for King Ladislaus was dead, and\r\nLombardy divided into several parts; so that there was nothing either\r\ninternal or external to occasion uneasiness. Next to Niccolo da Uzzano\r\nin authority, were Bartolomeo Valori, Neroni di Nigi, Rinaldo degli\r\nAlbizzi, Neri di Gino, and Lapo Niccolini. The factions that arose from\r\nthe quarrels of the Albizzi and the Ricci, and which were afterward so\r\nunhappily revived by Salvestro de' Medici, were never extinguished; for\r\nthough the party most favored by the rabble only continued three\r\nyears, and in 1381 was put down, still, as it comprehended the greatest\r\nnumerical proportion, it was never entirely extinct, though the frequent\r\nBalias and persecutions of its leaders from 1381 to 1400, reduced it\r\nalmost to nothing. The first families that suffered in this way were the\r\nAlberti, the Ricci, and the Medici, which were frequently deprived both\r\nof men and money; and if any of them remained in the city, they were\r\ndeprived of the honors of government. These oft-repeated acts of\r\noppression humiliated the faction, and almost annihilated it. Still,\r\nmany retained the remembrance of the injuries they had received, and\r\na desire of vengeance remained pent in their bosoms, ungratified and\r\nunquenched. Those nobles of the people, or new nobility, who peaceably\r\ngoverned the city, committed two errors, which eventually caused the\r\nruin of their party; the first was, that by long continuance in power\r\nthey became insolent; the second, that the envy they entertained toward\r\neach other, and their uninterrupted possession of power, destroyed that\r\nvigilance over those who might injure them, which they ought to have\r\nexercised. Thus daily renewing the hatred of a mass of the people by\r\ntheir sinister proceedings, and either negligent of the threatened\r\ndangers, because rendered fearless by prosperity, or encouraging them\r\nthrough mutual envy, they gave an opportunity to the family of the\r\nMedici to recover their influence. The first to do so was Giovanni di\r\nBicci de' Medici, who having become one of the richest men, and being of\r\na humane and benevolent disposition, obtained the supreme magistracy\r\nby the consent of those in power. This circumstance gave so much\r\ngratification to the mass of the people (the multitude thinking they had\r\nnow found a defender), that not without occasion the judicious of the\r\nparty observed it with jealousy, for they perceived all the former\r\nfeelings of the city revived. Niccolo da Uzzano did not fail to acquaint\r\nthe other citizens with the matter, explaining to them how dangerous it\r\nwas to aggrandize one who possessed so much influence; that it was easy\r\nto remedy an evil at its commencement, but exceedingly difficult after\r\nhaving allowed it to gather strength; and that Giovanni possessed\r\nseveral qualities far surpassing those of Salvestro. The associates of\r\nNiccolo were uninfluenced by his remarks; for they were jealous of his\r\nreputation, and desired to exalt some person, by means of whom he might\r\nbe humbled.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of Florence, in which opposing feelings began to\r\nbe observable, when Filippo Visconti, second son of Giovanni Galeazzo,\r\nhaving, by the death of his brother, become master of all Lombardy, and\r\nthinking he might undertake almost anything, greatly desired to recover\r\nGenoa, which enjoyed freedom under the Dogiate of Tommaso da Campo\r\nFregoso. He did not think it advisable to attempt this, or any other\r\nenterprise, till he had renewed amicable relations with the Florentines,\r\nand made his good understanding with them known; but with the aid of\r\ntheir reputation he trusted he should attain his wishes. He therefore\r\nsent ambassadors to Florence to signify his desires. Many citizens were\r\nopposed to his design, but did not wish to interrupt the peace with\r\nMilan, which had now continued for many years. They were fully aware of\r\nthe advantages he would derive from a war with Genoa, and the little use\r\nit would be to Florence. Many others were inclined to accede to it, but\r\nwould set a limit to his proceedings, which, if he were to exceed, all\r\nwould perceive his base design, and thus they might, when the treaty was\r\nbroken, more justifiably make war against him. The question having been\r\nstrongly debated, an amicable arrangement was at length effected, by\r\nwhich Filippo engaged not to interfere with anything on the Florentine\r\nside of the rivers Magra and Panaro.\r\n\r\nSoon after the treaty was concluded, the duke took possession of\r\nBrescia, and shortly afterward of Genoa, contrary to the expectation\r\nof those who had advocated peace; for they thought Brescia would be\r\ndefended by the Venetians, and Genoa would be able to defend herself.\r\nAnd as in the treaty which Filippo made with the Doge of Genoa, he had\r\nacquired Serezana and other places situated on this side the Magra, upon\r\ncondition that, if he wished to alienate them, they should be given to\r\nthe Genoese, it was quite palpable that he had broken the treaty; and he\r\nhad, besides, entered into another treaty with the legate of Bologna,\r\nin opposition to his engagement respecting the Panaro. These things\r\ndisturbed the minds of the citizens, and made them, apprehensive of new\r\ntroubles, consider the means to be adopted for their defense.\r\n\r\nThe dissatisfaction of the Florentines coming to the knowledge of\r\nFilippo, he, either to justify himself, or to become acquainted with\r\ntheir prevailing feelings, or to lull them to repose, sent ambassadors\r\nto the city, to intimate that he was greatly surprised at the suspicions\r\nthey entertained, and offered to revoke whatever he had done that could\r\nbe thought a ground of jealousy. This embassy produced no other\r\neffect than that of dividing the citizens; one party, that in greatest\r\nreputation, judged it best to arm, and prepare to frustrate the enemy's\r\ndesigns; and if he were to remain quiet, it would not be necessary to go\r\nto war with him, but an endeavor might be made to preserve peace. Many\r\nothers, whether envious of those in power, or fearing a rupture with the\r\nduke, considered it unadvisable so lightly to entertain suspicions of\r\nan ally, and thought his proceedings need not have excited so much\r\ndistrust; that appointing the ten and hiring forces was in itself a\r\nmanifest declaration of war, which, if undertaken against so great a\r\nprince, would bring certain ruin upon the city without the hope of any\r\nadvantage; for possession could never be retained of the conquests that\r\nmight be made, because Romagna lay between, and the vicinity of the\r\nchurch ought to prevent any attempt against Romagna itself. However the\r\nviews of those who were in favor of war prevailed, the Council of Ten\r\nwere appointed, forces were hired, and new taxes levied, which, as they\r\nwere more burdensome upon the lower than the upper ranks, filled the\r\ncity with complaints, and all condemned the ambition and avarice of the\r\ngreat, declaring that, to gratify themselves and oppress the people,\r\nthey would go to war without any justifiable motive.\r\n\r\nThey had not yet come to an open rupture with the duke, but everything\r\ntended to excite suspicion; for Filippo had, at the request of the\r\nlegate of Bologna (who was in fear of Antonio Bentivogli, an emigrant\r\nof Bologna at Castel Bolognese), sent forces to that city, which,\r\nbeing close upon the Florentine territory, filled the citizens with\r\napprehension; but what gave every one greater alarm, and offered\r\nsufficient occasion for the declaration of war, was the expedition made\r\nby the duke against Furli. Giorgio Ordelaffi was lord of Furli, who\r\ndying, left Tibaldo, his son, under the guardianship of Filippo. The\r\nboy's mother, suspicious of his guardian, sent him to Lodovico Alidossi,\r\nher father, who was lord of Imola, but she was compelled by the people\r\nof Furli to obey the will of her deceased husband, to withdraw him from\r\nthe natural guardian, and place him in the hands of the duke. Upon\r\nthis Filippo, the better to conceal his purpose, caused the Marquis of\r\nFerrara to send Guido Torello as his agent, with forces, to seize the\r\ngovernment of Furli, and thus the territory fell into the duke's hands.\r\nWhen this was known at Florence, together with the arrival of forces at\r\nBologna, the arguments in favor of war were greatly strengthened, but\r\nthere were still many opposed to it, and among the rest Giovanni de'\r\nMedici, who publicly endeavored to show, that even if the ill designs of\r\nthe duke were perfectly manifest, it would still be better to wait and\r\nlet him commence the attack, than to assail him; for in the former case\r\nthey would be justified in the view of the princes of Italy as well as\r\nin their own; but if they were to strike the first blow at the duke,\r\npublic opinion would be as favorable to him as to themselves; and\r\nbesides, they could not so confidently demand assistance as assailants,\r\nas they might do if assailed; and that men always defend themselves more\r\nvigorously when they attack others. The advocates of war considered it\r\nimproper to await the enemy in their houses, and better to go and seek\r\nhim; that fortune is always more favorable to assailants than to such\r\nas merely act on the defensive, and that it is less injurious, even when\r\nattended with greater immediate expense, to make war at another's door\r\nthan at our own. These views prevailed, and it was resolved that the ten\r\nshould provide all the means in their power for rescuing Furli from the\r\nhands of the duke.\r\n\r\nFilippo, finding the Florentines resolved to occupy the places he had\r\nundertaken to defend, postponed all personal considerations, and sent\r\nAgnolo della Pergola with a strong force against Imola, that Ludovico,\r\nhaving to provide for the defense of his own possessions, might be\r\nunable to protect the interests of his grandson. Agnolo approached Imola\r\nwhile the forces of the Florentines were at Modigliana, and an intense\r\nfrost having rendered the ditches of the city passable, he crossed them\r\nduring the night, captured the place, and sent Lodovico a prisoner to\r\nMilan. The Florentines finding Imola in the hands of the enemy, and the\r\nwar publicly known, sent their forces to Furli and besieged it on all\r\nsides. That the duke's people might not relieve it, they hired Count\r\nAlberigo, who from Zagonara, his own domain, overran the country daily,\r\nup to the gates of Imola. Agnolo della Pergola, finding the strong\r\nposition which the Florentines had taken prevented him from relieving\r\nFurli, determined to attempt the capture of Zagonara, thinking they\r\nwould not allow that place to be lost, and that in the endeavor to\r\nrelieve it they would be compelled to give up their design against\r\nFurli, and come to an engagement under great disadvantage. Thus the\r\nduke's people compelled Alberigo to sue for terms, which he obtained on\r\ncondition of giving up Zagonara, if the Florentines did not relieve him\r\nwithin fifteen days. This misfortune being known in the Florentine camp\r\nand in the city, and all being anxious that the enemy should not obtain\r\nthe expected advantage, they enabled him to secure a greater; for\r\nhaving abandoned the siege of Furli to go to the relief of Zagonara, on\r\nencountering the enemy they were soon routed, not so much by the bravery\r\nof their adversaries as by the severity of the season; for, having\r\nmarched many hours through deep mud and heavy rain, they found the enemy\r\nquite fresh, and were therefore easily vanquished. Nevertheless, in\r\nthis great defeat, famous throughout all Italy, no death occurred except\r\nthose of Lodovico degli Obizi and two of his people, who having fallen\r\nfrom their horses were drowned in the morass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe Florentines murmur against those who had been advocates of the\r\nwar--Rinaldo degli Albizzi encourages the citizens--Measures for the\r\nprosecution of the war--Attempt of the higher classes to deprive the\r\nplebeians of their share in the government--Rinaldo degli Albizzi\r\naddresses an assembly of citizens and advises the restoration of the\r\n_Grandi_--Niccolo da Uzzano wishes to have Giovanni de' Medici on their\r\nside--Giovanni disapproves of the advice of Rinaldo degli Albizzi.\r\n\r\nThe defeat at Zagonara spread consternation throughout Florence; but\r\nnone felt it so severely as the nobility, who had been in favor of the\r\nwar; for they perceived their enemies to be inspirited and themselves\r\ndisarmed, without friends, and opposed by the people, who at the corners\r\nof streets insulted them with sarcastic expressions, complaining of the\r\nheavy taxes, and the unnecessary war, and saying, \"Oh! they appointed\r\nthe ten to frighten the enemy. Have they relieved Furli, and rescued her\r\nfrom the hands of the duke? No! but their designs have been discovered;\r\nand what had they in view? not the defense of liberty; for they do not\r\nlove her; but to aggrandize their own power, which God has very justly\r\nabated. This is not the only enterprise by many a one with which they\r\nhave oppressed the city; for the war against King Ladislaus was of a\r\nsimilar kind. To whom will they flee for assistance now? to Pope Martin,\r\nwhom they ridiculed before the face of Braccio; or to Queen Giovanna,\r\nwhom they abandoned, and compelled to throw herself under the protection\r\nof the king of Aragon?\" To these reproaches was added all that might be\r\nexpected from an enraged multitude.\r\n\r\nSeeing the discontent so prevalent, the Signory resolved to assemble\r\na few citizens, and with soft words endeavor to soothe the popular\r\nirritation. On this occasion, Rinaldo degli Albizzi, the eldest son of\r\nMaso, who, by his own talents and the respect he derived from the memory\r\nof his father, aspired to the first offices in the government, spoke at\r\ngreat length; showing that it is not right to judge of actions merely\r\nby their effects; for it often happens that what has been very maturely\r\nconsidered is attended with unfavorable results: that if we are to\r\napplaud evil counsels because they are sometimes followed by fortunate\r\nevents, we should only encourage men in error which would bring great\r\nmischief upon the republic; because evil counsel is not always attended\r\nwith happy consequences. In the same way, it would be wrong to blame\r\na wise resolution, because if its being attended with an unfavorable\r\nissue; for by so doing, we should destroy the inclination of citizens\r\nto offer advice and speak the truth. He then showed the propriety\r\nof undertaking the war; and that if it had not been commenced by the\r\nFlorentines in Romagna the duke would have assailed them in Tuscany. But\r\nsince it had pleased God, that the Florentine people should be overcome,\r\ntheir loss would be still greater if they allowed themselves to be\r\ndejected; but if they set a bold front against adversity, and made good\r\nuse of the means within their power, they would not be sensible of their\r\nloss or the duke of his victory. He assured them they ought not to\r\nbe alarmed by impending expenses and consequent taxation; because the\r\nlatter might be reduced, and the future expense would not be so great as\r\nthe former had been; for less preparation is necessary for those engaged\r\nin self-defense than for those who design to attack others. He advised\r\nthem to imitate the conduct of their forefathers, who, by courageous\r\nconduct in adverse circumstances, had defended themselves against all\r\ntheir enemies.\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, the citizens engaged Count Oddo the son of Braccio,\r\nand united with him, for directing the operations of the war, Niccolo\r\nPiccinino, a pupil of his father's, and one of the most celebrated of\r\nall who had served under him. To these they added other leaders, and\r\nremounted some of those who had lost their horses in the late defeat.\r\nThey also appointed twenty citizens to levy new taxes, who finding the\r\ngreat quite subdued by the recent loss, took courage and drained them\r\nwithout mercy.\r\n\r\nThese burdens were very grievous to the nobility, who at first, in order\r\nto conciliate, did not complain of their own particular hardships, but\r\ncensured the tax generally as unjust, and advised that something should\r\nbe done in the way of relief; but their advice was rejected in the\r\nCouncils. Therefore, to render the law as offensive as possible, and to\r\nmake all sensible of its injustice, they contrived that the taxes should\r\nbe levied with the utmost rigor, and made it lawful to kill any that\r\nmight resist the officers employed to collect them. Hence followed many\r\nlamentable collisions, attended with the blood and death of citizens. It\r\nbegan to be the impression of all, that arms would be resorted to, and\r\nall prudent persons apprehended some approaching evil; for the higher\r\nranks, accustomed to be treated with respect, could not endure to be\r\nused like dogs; and the rest were desirous that the taxation should be\r\nequalized. In consequence of this state of things, many of the first\r\ncitizens met together, and it was resolved that it had become necessary\r\nfor their safety, that some attempt should be made to recover the\r\ngovernment; since their want of vigilance had encouraged men to censure\r\npublic actions, and allowed those to interfere in affairs who had\r\nhitherto been merely the leaders of the rabble. Having repeatedly\r\ndiscussed the subject, they resolved to meet again at an appointed hour,\r\nwhen upwards of seventy citizens assembled in the church of St. Stephen,\r\nwith the permission of Lorenzo Ridolfi and Francesco Gianfigliazzi, both\r\nmembers of the Signory. Giovanni de' Medici was not among them either\r\nbecause being under suspicion he was not invited or that entertaining\r\ndifferent views he was unwilling to interfere.\r\n\r\nRinaldo degli Albizzi addressed the assembly, describing the condition\r\nof the city, and showing how by their own negligence it had again fallen\r\nunder the power of the plebeians, from whom it had been wrested by their\r\nfathers in 1381. He reminded them of the iniquity of the government\r\nwhich was in power from 1378 to 1381, and that all who were then present\r\nhad to lament, some a father, others a grandfather, put to death by its\r\ntyranny. He assured them they were now in the same danger, and that the\r\ncity was sinking under the same disorders. The multitude had already\r\nimposed a tax of its own authority; and would soon, if not restrained\r\nby greater force or better regulations, appoint the magistrates, who, in\r\nthis case, would occupy their places, and overturn the government which\r\nfor forty-two years had ruled the city with so much glory; the citizens\r\nwould then be subject to the will of the multitude, and live disorderly\r\nand dangerous, or be under the command of some individual who might make\r\nhimself prince. For these reasons he was of opinion, that whoever loved\r\nhis country and his honor must arouse himself, and call to mind the\r\nvirtue of Bardo Mancini, who, by the ruin of the Alberti, rescued the\r\ncity from the dangers then impending; and that the cause of the audacity\r\nnow assumed by the multitude was the extensive Squittini or Pollings,\r\nwhich, by their negligence, were allowed to be made; for thus the palace\r\nhad become filled with low men. He therefore concluded, that the\r\nonly means of remedying the evil was to restore the government to the\r\nnobility, and diminish the authority of the minor trades by reducing the\r\ncompanies from fourteen to seven, which would give the plebeians less\r\nauthority in the Councils, both by the reduction in their number and\r\nby increasing the authority of the great; who, on account of former\r\nenmities, would be disinclined to favor them. He added, that it is\r\na good thing to know how to avail themselves of men according to the\r\ntimes; and that as their fathers had used the plebeians to reduce the\r\ninfluence of the great, that now, the great having been humbled, and the\r\nplebeians become insolent, it was well to restrain the insolence of\r\nthe latter by the assistance of the former. To effect this they might\r\nproceed either openly or otherwise, for some of them belonging to the\r\nCouncil of Ten, forces might be led into the city without exciting\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nRinaldo was much applauded, and his advice was approved of by the whole\r\nassembly. Niccolo da Uzzano who, among others, replied to it, said, \"All\r\nthat Rinaldo had advanced was correct, and the remedies he proposed good\r\nand certain, if they could be adopted without an absolute division\r\nof the city; and this he had no doubt would be effected if they could\r\ninduce Giovanni de' Medici to join them; for with him on their side,\r\nthe multitude being deprived of their chief and stay, would be unable\r\nto oppose them; but that if he did not concur with them they could do\r\nnothing without arms, and that with them they would incur the risk of\r\nbeing vanquished, or of not being able to reap the fruit of victory.\" He\r\nthen modestly reminded them of what he had said upon a former occasion,\r\nand of their reluctance to remedy the evil when it might easily have\r\nbeen done; that now the same remedy could not be attempted without\r\nincurring the danger of greater evils, and therefore there was nothing\r\nleft for them to do but to gain him over to their side, if practicable.\r\nRinaldo was then commissioned to wait upon Giovanni and try if he could\r\ninduce him to join them.\r\n\r\nHe undertook this commission, and in the most prevailing words he could\r\nmake use of endeavored to induce him to coincide with their views; and\r\nbegged that he would not by favoring an audacious mob, enable them to\r\ncomplete the ruin both of the government and the city. To this Giovanni\r\nreplied, that he considered it the duty of a good and wise citizen to\r\navoid altering the institutions to which a city is accustomed; there\r\nbeing nothing so injurious to the people as such a change; for many are\r\nnecessarily offended, and where there are several discontented, some\r\nunpropitious event may be constantly apprehended. He said it appeared to\r\nhim that their resolution would have two exceedingly pernicious effects;\r\nthe one conferring honors on those who, having never possessed them,\r\nesteemed them the less, and therefore had the less occasion to grieve\r\nfor their absence; the other taking them from those who being accustomed\r\nto their possession would never be at rest till they were restored to\r\nthem. It would thus be evident that the injury done to one party, was\r\ngreater than the benefit they had conferred upon the other; so that\r\nwhoever was the author of the proposition, he would gain few friends and\r\nmake many enemies, and that the latter would be more resolutely bent\r\non injuring him than the former would be zealous for his defense, for\r\nmankind are naturally more disposed to revenge than to gratitude, as\r\nif the latter could only be exercised with some inconvenience to\r\nthemselves, while the former brings alike gratification and profit.\r\nThen, directing his discourse more particularly to Rinaldo, he said,\r\n\"And you, if you could call to mind past events, and knew how craftily\r\naffairs are conducted in this city, would not be so eager in this\r\npursuit; for he who advises it, when by your aid he has wrested the\r\npower from the people, will, with the people's assistance, who will have\r\nbecome your enemies, deprive you of it. And it will happen to you as\r\nto Benedetto Alberti, who, at the persuasion of those who were not his\r\nfriends, consented to the ruin of Giorgio Scali and Tommaso Strozzi, and\r\nshortly afterward was himself sent into exile by the very same men.\" He\r\ntherefore advised Rinaldo to think more maturely of these things, and\r\nendeavor to imitate his father, who, to obtain the benevolence of all,\r\nreduced the price of salt, provided that whoever owed taxes under half\r\na florin should be at liberty to pay them or not, as he thought proper,\r\nand that at the meeting of the Councils every one should be free from\r\nthe importunities of his creditors. He concluded by saying, that as\r\nregarded himself, he was disposed to let the government of the city\r\nremain as it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGiovanni de' Medici acquires the favor of the people--Bravery of Biaggio\r\ndel Melano--Baseness of Zanobi del Pino--The Florentines obtain the\r\nfriendship of the lord of Faenza--League of the Florentines with the\r\nVenetians--Origin of the Catasto--The rich citizens discontented with\r\nit--Peace with the duke of Milan--New disturbances on account of the\r\nCatasto.\r\n\r\nThese events, and the circumstances attending them, becoming known to\r\nthe people, contributed greatly to increase the reputation of Giovanni,\r\nand brought odium on those who had made the proposals; but he assumed an\r\nappearance of indifference, in order to give less encouragement to\r\nthose who by his influence were desirous of change. In his discourse he\r\nintimated to every one that it is not desirable to promote factions, but\r\nrather to extinguish them; and that whatever might be expected of him,\r\nhe only sought the union of the city. This, however, gave offense to\r\nmany of his party; for they would have rather seen him exhibit greater\r\nactivity. Among others so disposed, was Alamanno de' Medici, who being\r\nof a restless disposition, never ceased exciting him to persecute\r\nenemies and favor friends; condemning his coldness and slow method\r\nof proceeding, which he said was the cause of his enemies' practicing\r\nagainst him, and that these practices would one day effect the ruin of\r\nhimself and his friends. He endeavored to excite Cosmo, his son, with\r\nsimilar discourses; but Giovanni, for all that was either disclosed or\r\nforetold him, remained unmoved, although parties were now declared, and\r\nthe city in manifest disunion.\r\n\r\nThere were at the palace, in the service of the Signory, two\r\nchancellors, Ser Martino and Ser Pagolo. The latter favored the party\r\nof Niccolo da Uzzano, the former that of Giovanni; and Rinaldo, seeing\r\nGiovanni unwilling to join them, thought it would be advisable to\r\ndeprive Ser Martino of his office, that he might have the palace\r\nmore completely under his control. The design becoming known to his\r\nadversaries, Ser Martino was retained and Ser Pagolo discharged, to the\r\ngreat injury and displeasure of Rinaldo and his party. This circumstance\r\nwould soon have produced most mischievous effects, but for the war\r\nwith which the city was threatened, and the recent defeat suffered at\r\nZagonara, which served to check the audacity of the people; for while\r\nthese events were in progress at Florence, Agnolo della Pergola, with\r\nthe forces of the duke, had taken all the towns and cities possessed\r\nby the Florentines in Romagna, except Castracaro and Modigliano; partly\r\nfrom the weakness of the places themselves, and partly by the misconduct\r\nof those who had the command of them. In the course of the campaign, two\r\ninstances occurred which served to show how greatly courage is admired\r\neven in enemies, and how much cowardice and pusillanimity are despised.\r\n\r\nBiaggio del Melano was castellan in the fortress of Monte Petroso. Being\r\nsurrounded by enemies, and seeing no chance of saving the place, which\r\nwas already in flames, he cast clothes and straw from a part which was\r\nnot yet on fire, and upon these he threw his two little children, saying\r\nto the enemy, \"Take to yourselves those goods which fortune has bestowed\r\nupon me, and of which you may deprive me; but those of the mind, in\r\nwhich my honor and glory consist, I will not give up, neither can you\r\nwrest them from me.\" The besiegers ran to save the children, and placed\r\nfor their father ropes and ladders, by which to save himself, but he\r\nwould not use them, and rather chose to die in the flames than owe his\r\nsafety to the enemies of his country: an example worthy of that much\r\nlauded antiquity, which offers nothing to surpass it, and which we\r\nadmire the more from the rarity of any similar occurrence. Whatever\r\ncould be recovered from the ruins, was restored for the use of the\r\nchildren, and carefully conveyed to their friends; nor was the republic\r\nless grateful; for as long as they lived, they were supported at her\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nAn example of an opposite character occurred at Galeata, where Zanobi\r\ndel Pino was governor; he, without offering the least resistance, gave\r\nup the fortress to the enemy; and besides this, advised Agnolo della\r\nPergola to leave the Alps of Romagna, and come among the smaller hills\r\nof Tuscany, where he might carry on the war with less danger and greater\r\nadvantage. Agnolo could not endure the mean and base spirit of this man,\r\nand delivered him to his own attendants, who, after many reproaches,\r\ngave him nothing to eat but paper painted with snakes, saying, that of a\r\nGuelph they would make him a Ghibelline; and thus fasting, he died in a\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\nAt this time Count Oddo and Niccolo Piccinino entered the Val di Lamona,\r\nwith the design of bringing the lord of Faenza over to the Florentines,\r\nor at least inducing him to restrain the incursions of Agnolo della\r\nPergola into Romagna; but as this valley is naturally strong, and its\r\ninhabitants warlike, Count Oddo was slain there, and Niccolo Piccinino\r\nsent a prisoner to Faenza. Fortune, however, caused the Florentines to\r\nobtain by their loss, what, perhaps, they would have failed to acquire\r\nby victory; for Niccolo so prevailed with the lord of Faenza and his\r\nmother, that they became friends of the Florentines. By this treaty,\r\nNiccolo Piccinino was set at liberty, but did not take the advice he had\r\ngiven others; for while in treaty with the city, concerning the terms of\r\nhis engagement, either the conditions proposed were insufficient, or he\r\nfound better elsewhere; for quite suddenly he left Arezzo, where he had\r\nbeen staying, passed into Lombardy, and entered the service of the duke.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines, alarmed by this circumstance, and reduced to\r\ndespondency by their frequent losses, thought themselves unable to\r\nsustain the war alone, and sent ambassadors to the Venetians, to beg\r\nthey would lend their aid to oppose the greatness of one who, if allowed\r\nto aggrandize himself, would soon become as dangerous to them as to the\r\nFlorentines themselves. The Venetians were advised to adopt the same\r\ncourse by Francesco Carmignuola, one of the most distinguished warriors\r\nof those times, who had been in the service of the duke, and had\r\nafterward quitted it; but they hesitated, not knowing how far to trust\r\nhim; for they thought his enmity with the duke was only feigned. While\r\nin this suspense, it was found that the duke, by means of a servant\r\nof Carmignuola, had caused poison to be given him in his food, which,\r\nalthough it was not fatal, reduced him to extremity. The truth being\r\ndiscovered, the Venetians laid aside their suspicion; and as the\r\nFlorentines still solicited their assistance, a treaty was formed\r\nbetween the two powers, by which they agreed to carry on the war at the\r\ncommon expense of both: the conquests in Lombardy to be assigned to\r\nthe Venetians; those in Romagna and Tuscany to the Florentines; and\r\nCarmignuola was appointed Captain General of the League. By this treaty\r\nthe war was commenced in Lombardy, where it was admirably conducted; for\r\nin a few months many places were taken from the duke, together with the\r\ncity of Brescia, the capture of which was in those days considered a\r\nmost brilliant exploit.\r\n\r\nThe war had continued from 1422 to 1427, and the citizens of Florence\r\nwere so wearied of the taxes that had been imposed during that time,\r\nthat it was resolved to revise them, preparatory to their amelioration.\r\nThat they might be equalized according to the means of each citizen, it\r\nwas proposed that whoever possessed property of the value of one hundred\r\nflorins should pay half a florin of taxes. Individual contribution would\r\nthus be determined by an invariable rule, and not left to the discretion\r\nof parties; and as it was found that the new method would press heavily\r\nupon the powerful classes, they used their utmost endeavors to prevent\r\nit from becoming law. Giovanni de' Medici alone declared himself in\r\nfavor of it, and by his means it was passed. In order to determine the\r\namount each had to pay, it was necessary to consider his property in the\r\naggregate, which the Florentines call _accatastare_, in which in this\r\napplication of it would signify TO RATE or VALUE, and hence this tax\r\nreceived the name of _catasto_. The new method of rating formed a\r\npowerful check to the tyranny of the great, who could no longer oppress\r\nthe lower classes, or silence them with threats in the council as they\r\nhad formerly done, and it therefore gave general satisfaction, though to\r\nthe wealthy classes it was in the highest degree offensive. But as it is\r\nfound men are never satisfied, but that the possession of one advantage\r\nonly makes them desire more, the people, not content with the equality\r\nof taxation which the new law produced, demanded that the same rule\r\nshould be applied to past years; that in investigation should be made\r\nto determine how much, according to the Catasto, the rich had paid less\r\nthan their share, and that they should now pay up to an equality with\r\nthose who, in order to meet the demand unjustly made, had been compelled\r\nto sell their possessions. This proposal alarmed the great more than\r\nthe Catasto had done; and in self-defense they unceasingly decried it,\r\ndeclaring it in the highest degree unjust in being laid not only on\r\nimmovable but movable property, which people possess to-day and lose\r\nto-morrow; that many persons have hidden wealth which the Catasto cannot\r\nreach; that those who leave their own affairs to manage those of the\r\nrepublic should be less burdened by her, it being enough for them to\r\ngive their labour, and that it was unjust of the city to take both\r\ntheir property and their time, while of others she only took money. The\r\nadvocates of the Catasto replied, that if movable property varies, the\r\ntaxes would also vary, and frequently rating it would remedy the evil\r\nto which it was subject; that it was unnecessary to mention those who\r\npossessed hidden property; for it would be unreasonable to take taxes\r\nfor that which produced no interest, and that if it paid anything, it\r\ncould not fail to be discovered: that those who did not like to labor\r\nfor the republic might cease to do so; for no doubt she would find\r\nplenty of loving citizens who would take pleasure in assisting her\r\nwith both money and counsel: that the advantages and honors of a\r\nparticipation in the government are so great, that of themselves they\r\nare a sufficient remuneration to those who thus employ themselves,\r\nwithout wishing to be excused from paying their share of taxes. But,\r\nthey added, the real grievance had not been mentioned: for those who\r\nwere offended with the Catasto, regretted they could no longer involve\r\nthe city in all the difficulties of war without injury to themselves,\r\nnow that they had to contribute like the rest; and that if this law had\r\nthen been in force they would not have gone to war with King Ladislaus,\r\nor the Duke Filippo, both which enterprises had been not through\r\nnecessity, but to impoverish the citizens. The excitement was appeased\r\nby Giovanni de' Medici, who said, \"It is not well to go into things so\r\nlong past, unless to learn something for our present guidance; and if in\r\nformer times the taxation has been unjust, we ought to be thankful, that\r\nwe have now discovered a method of making it equitable, and hope that\r\nthis will be the means of uniting the citizens, not of dividing them;\r\nwhich would certainly be the case were they to attempt the recovery of\r\ntaxes for the past, and make them equal to the present; and that he who\r\nis content with a moderate victory is always most successful; for those\r\nwho would more than conquer, commonly lose.\" With such words as these\r\nhe calmed the disturbance, and this retrospective equalization was no\r\nlonger contemplated.\r\n\r\nThe war with the duke still continued; but peace was at length restored\r\nby means of a legate of the pope. The duke, however, from the first\r\ndisregarded the conditions, so that the league again took arms, and\r\nmeeting the enemy's forces at Maclovio routed them. After this defeat\r\nthe duke again made proposals for peace, to which the Florentines\r\nand Venetians both agreed; the former from jealousy of the Venetians,\r\nthinking they had spent quite enough money in the aggrandizement of\r\nothers; the latter, because they found Carmignuola, after the defeat of\r\nthe duke, proceed but coldly in their cause; so that they thought it no\r\nlonger safe to trust him. A treaty was therefore concluded in 1428, by\r\nwhich the Florentines recovered the places they had lost in Romagna;\r\nand the Venetians kept Brescia, to which the duke added Bergamo and the\r\ncountry around it. In this war the Florentines expended three millions\r\nand a half of ducats, extended the territory and power of the Venetians,\r\nand brought poverty and disunion upon themselves.\r\n\r\nBeing at peace with their neighbors, domestic troubles recommenced. The\r\ngreat citizens could not endure the Catasto, and not knowing how to\r\nset it aside, they endeavored to raise up more numerous enemies to\r\nthe measure, and thus provide themselves with allies to assist them in\r\nannulling it. They therefore instructed the officers appointed to levy\r\nthe tax, that the law required them to extend the Catasto over the\r\nproperty of their nearest neighbors, to see if Florentine wealth was\r\nconcealed among it. The dependent states were therefore ordered to\r\npresent a schedule of their property against a certain time. This was\r\nextremely offensive to the people of Volterra, who sent to the Signory\r\nto complain of it; but the officers, in great wrath, committed eighteen\r\nof the complainants to prison. The Volterrani, however, out of regard\r\nfor their fellow-countrymen who were arrested, did not proceed to any\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDeath of Giovanni de' Medici--His character--Insurrection of\r\nVolterra--Volterra returns to her allegiance--Niccolo Fortebraccio\r\nattacks the Lucchese--Diversity of opinion about the Lucchese\r\nwar--War with Lucca--Astore Gianni and Rinaldo degli Albizzi appointed\r\ncommissaries--Violence of Astorre Gianni.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Giovanni de' Medici was taken ill, and finding his end\r\napproach, called his sons Cosmo and Lorenzo to him, to give them his\r\nlast advice, and said, \"I find I have nearly reached the term which\r\nGod and nature appointed at my birth, and I die content, knowing that\r\nI leave you rich, healthy, and of such standing in society, that if you\r\npursue the same course that I have, you will live respected in Florence,\r\nand in favor with everyone. Nothing cheers me so much at this moment, as\r\nthe recollection that I have never willfully offended anyone; but have\r\nalways used my utmost endeavors to confer benefits upon all. I would\r\nhave you do so too. With regard to state affairs, if you would live in\r\nsecurity, take just such a share as the laws and your countrymen think\r\nproper to bestow, thus you will escape both danger and envy; for it\r\nis not what is given to any individual, but what he has determined to\r\npossess, that occasions odium. You will thus have a larger share than\r\nthose who endeavor to engross more than belongs to them; for they\r\nthus usually lose their own, and before they lose it, live in constant\r\ndisquiet. By adopting this method, although among so many enemies, and\r\nsurrounded by so many conflicting interests, I have not only maintained\r\nmy reputation but increased my influence. If you pursue the same course,\r\nyou will be attended by the same good fortune; if otherwise, you may be\r\nassured, your end will resemble that of those who in our own times have\r\nbrought ruin both upon themselves and their families.\" Soon after this\r\ninterview with his sons, Giovanni died, regretted by everyone, as his\r\nmany excellencies deserved. He was compassionate; not only bestowing\r\nalms on those who asked them, but very frequently relieving the\r\nnecessities of the poor, without having been solicited so to do. He\r\nloved all; praised the good, and pitied the infirmities of the wicked.\r\nHe never sought the honors of government; yet enjoyed them all; and\r\nnever went to the palace unless by request. He loved peace and shunned\r\nwar; relieved mankind in adversity, and assisted them in prosperity;\r\nnever applied the public money to his own uses, but contributed to the\r\npublic wealth. He was courteous in office; not a man of great eloquence,\r\nbut possessed of extraordinary prudence. His demeanor expressed\r\nmelancholy; but after a short time his conversation became pleasant and\r\nfacetious. He died exceedingly rich in money, but still more in good\r\nfame and the best wishes of mankind; and the wealth and respect he left\r\nbehind him were not only preserved but increased by his son Cosmo.\r\n\r\nThe Volterran ambassadors grew weary of lying in prison, and to obtain\r\ntheir liberty promised to comply with the commands of the Florentines.\r\nBeing set free and returned to their city, the time arrived for the new\r\nPriors to enter upon office, and among those who were drawn, was one\r\nnamed Giusto, a plebeian, but possessing great influence with his class,\r\nand one of those who had been imprisoned at Florence. He, being inflamed\r\nwith hatred against the Florentines on account of his public as well as\r\npersonal injuries, was further stimulated by Giovanni di Contugi, a man\r\nof noble family, and his colleague in office, to induce the people, by\r\nthe authority of the Priors and his own influence, to withdraw their\r\ncountry from the power of the Florentines, and make himself prince.\r\nPrompted by these motives, Giusto took arms, rode through the city,\r\nseized the Capitano, who resided in it, on behalf of the Florentines,\r\nand with the consent of the people, became lord of Volterra. This\r\ncircumstance greatly displeased the Florentines; but having just made\r\npeace with the duke, and the treaty being yet uninfringed on either\r\nside, they bethought themselves in a condition to recover the place;\r\nand that the opportunity might not be lost, they immediately appointed\r\nRinaldo degli Albizzi and Palla Strozzi commissaries, and sent them upon\r\nthe expedition. In the meantime, Giusto, who expected the Florentines\r\nwould attack him, requested assistance of Lucca and Sienna. The latter\r\nrefused, alleging her alliance with Florence; and Pagolo Guinigi, to\r\nregain the favor of the Florentines, which he imagined he had lost\r\nin the war with the duke and by his friendship for Filippo, not only\r\nrefused assistance to Giusto, but sent his messenger prisoner to\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nThe commissaries, to come upon the Volterrani unawares, assembled their\r\ncavalry, and having raised a good body of infantry in the Val d'Arno\r\nInferiore, and the country about Pisa, proceeded to Volterra. Although\r\nattacked by the Florentines and abandoned by his neighbors, Giusto did\r\nnot yield to fear; but, trusting to the strength of the city and the\r\nruggedness of the country around it, prepared for his defense.\r\n\r\nThere lived at Volterra one Arcolano, brother of that Giovanni Contugi\r\nwho had persuaded Giusto to assume the command. He possessed influence\r\namong the nobility, and having assembled a few of his most confidential\r\nfriends, he assured them that by this event, God had come to the relief\r\nof their necessities; for if they would only take arms, deprive Giusto\r\nof the Signory, and give up the city to the Florentines, they might be\r\nsure of obtaining the principal offices, and the place would retain all\r\nits ancient privileges. Having gained them over, they went to the\r\npalace in which Giusto resided; and while part of them remained below,\r\nArcolano, with three others, proceeded to the chamber above, where\r\nfinding him with some citizens, they drew him aside, as if desirous\r\nto communicate something of importance, and conversing on different\r\nsubjects, let him to the lower apartment, and fell upon him with their\r\nswords. They, however, were not so quick as to prevent Giusto from\r\nmaking use of his own weapon; for with it he seriously wounded two of\r\nthem; but being unable to resist so many, he was at last slain, and his\r\nbody thrown into the street. Arcolano and his party gave up the city\r\nto the Florentine commissaries, who, being at hand with their forces,\r\nimmediately took possession; but the condition of Volterra was worse\r\nthan before; for among other things which operated to her disadvantage,\r\nmost of the adjoining countryside was separated from her, and she was\r\nreduced to the rank of a vicariate.\r\n\r\nVolterra having been lost and recovered almost at the same time, present\r\ncircumstances afforded nothing of sufficient importance to occasion a\r\nnew war, if ambition had not again provoked one. Niccolo Fortebraccio,\r\nthe son of a sister of Braccio da Perugia, had been in the service\r\nof the Florentines during most of their wars with the duke. Upon the\r\nrestoration of peace he was discharged; but when the affair of\r\nVolterra took place, being encamped with his people at Fucecchio, the\r\ncommissaries availed themselves both of himself and his forces. Some\r\nthought that while Rinaldo conducted the expedition along with him, he\r\npersuaded him, under one pretext or another, to attack the Lucchese,\r\nassuring him, that if he did so, the Florentines would consent to\r\nundertake an expedition against them, and would appoint him to the\r\ncommand. When Volterra was recovered, and Niccolo returned to his\r\nquarters at Fucecchio, he, either at the persuasion of Rinaldo, or of\r\nhis own accord, in November, 1429, took possession of Ruoti and Compito,\r\ncastles belonging to the Lucchese, with three hundred cavalry and\r\nas many infantry, and then descending into the plain, plundered the\r\ninhabitants to a vast amount. The news of this incursion having\r\nreached Florence, persons of all classes were seen gathered in parties\r\nthroughout the city discussing the matter, and nearly all were in favor\r\nof an expedition against Lucca. Of the Grandees thus disposed, were the\r\nMedici and their party, and with them also Rinaldo, either because he\r\nthought the enterprise beneficial to the republic, or induced by his own\r\nambition and the expectation of being appointed to the command. Niccolo\r\nda Uzzano and his party were opposed to the war. It seems hardly\r\ncredible that such contrary opinions should prevail, though at different\r\ntimes, in the same men and the same city, upon the subject of war; for\r\nthe same citizens and people that, during the ten years of peace had\r\nincessantly blamed the war undertaken against Duke Filippo, in defense\r\nof liberty, now, after so much expense and trouble, with their utmost\r\nenergy, insisted on hostilities against Lucca, which, if successful,\r\nwould deprive that city of her liberty; while those who had been in\r\nfavor of a war with the duke, were opposed to the present; so much\r\nmore ready are the multitude to covet the possessions of others than to\r\npreserve their own, and so much more easily are they led by the hope\r\nof acquisition than by the fear of loss. The suggestions of the latter\r\nappear incredible till they are verified; and the pleasing anticipations\r\nof the former are cherished as facts, even while the advantages are very\r\nproblematical, or at best, remote. The people of Florence were inspired\r\nwith hope, by the acquisitions which Niccolo Fortebraccio had made, and\r\nby letters received from their rectors in the vicinity of Lucca; for\r\ntheir deputies at Vico and Pescia had written, that if permission were\r\ngiven to them to receive the castles that offered to surrender, the\r\nwhole country of Lucca would very soon be obtained. It must, however, be\r\nadded, that an ambassador was sent by the governor of Lucca to Florence,\r\nto complain of the attack made by Niccolo, and to entreat that the\r\nSignory would not make war against a neighbor, and a city that had\r\nalways been friendly to them. The ambassador was Jacopo Viviani, who, a\r\nshort time previously, had been imprisoned by Pagolo Guinigi, governor\r\nof Lucca, for having conspired against him. Although he had been found\r\nguilty, his life was spared, and as Pagolo thought the forgiveness\r\nmutual, he reposed confidence in him. Jacopo, more mindful of the danger\r\nhe had incurred than of the lenity exercised toward him, on his arrival\r\nin Florence secretly instigated the citizens to hostilities; and these\r\ninstigations, added to other hopes, induced the Signory to call the\r\nCouncil together, at which 498 citizens assembled, before whom the\r\nprincipal men of the city discussed the question.\r\n\r\nAmong the first who addressed the assembly in favor of the expedition,\r\nwas Rinaldo. He pointed out the advantage that would accrue from the\r\nacquisition, and justified the enterprise from its being left open to\r\nthem by the Venetians and the duke, and that as the pope was engaged in\r\nthe affairs of Naples, he could not interfere. He then remarked upon the\r\nfacility of the expedition, showing that Lucca, being now in bondage to\r\none of her own citizens, had lost her natural vigor and former anxiety\r\nfor the preservation of her liberty, and would either be surrendered to\r\nthem by the people in order to expel the tyrant, or by the tyrant for\r\nfear of the people. He recalled the remembrance of the injuries done to\r\nthe republic by the governor of Lucca; his malevolent disposition toward\r\nthem; and their embarrassing situation with regard to him, if the pope\r\nor the duke were to make war upon them; and concluded that no enterprise\r\nwas ever undertaken by the people of Florence with such perfect\r\nfacility, more positive advantage, or greater justice in its favor.\r\n\r\nIn a reply to this, Niccolo da Uzzano stated that the city of Florence\r\nnever entered on a more unjust or more dangerous project, or one more\r\npregnant with evil, than this. In the first place they were going to\r\nattack a Guelphic city, that had always been friendly to the Florentine\r\npeople, and had frequently, at great hazard, received the Guelphs into\r\nher bosom when they were expelled from their own country. That in the\r\nhistory of the past there was not an instance, while Lucca was free, of\r\nher having done an injury to the Florentines; and that if they had been\r\ninjured by her enslavers, as formerly by Castruccio, and now by the\r\npresent governor, the fault was not in the city, but in her tyrant.\r\nThat if they could assail the latter without detriment to the people,\r\nhe should have less scruple, but as this was impossible, he could\r\nnot consent that a city which had been friendly to Florence should be\r\nplundered of her wealth. However, as it was usual at present to pay\r\nlittle or no regard either to equity or injustice, he would consider the\r\nmatter solely with reference to the advantage of Florence. He thought\r\nthat what could not easily be attended by pernicious consequences might\r\nbe esteemed useful, but he could not imagine how an enterprise should\r\nbe called advantageous in which the evils were certain and the utility\r\ndoubtful. The certain evils were the expenses with which it would be\r\nattended; and these, he foresaw, would be sufficiently great to alarm\r\neven a people that had long been in repose, much more one wearied, as\r\nthey were, by a tedious and expensive war. The advantage that might be\r\ngained was the acquisition of Lucca, which he acknowledged to be great;\r\nbut the hazards were so enormous and immeasurable, as in his opinion\r\nto render the conquest quite impossible. He could not induce himself to\r\nbelieve that the Venetians, or Filippo, would willingly allow them to\r\nmake the acquisition; for the former only consented in appearance, in\r\norder to avoid the semblance of ingratitude, having so lately, with\r\nFlorentine money, acquired such an extent of dominion. That as regarded\r\nthe duke, it would greatly gratify him to see them involved in new wars\r\nand expenses; for, being exhausted and defeated on all sides, he might\r\nagain assail them; and that if, after having undertaken it, their\r\nenterprise against Lucca were to prove successful, and offer them the\r\nfullest hope of victory, the duke would not want an opportunity of\r\nfrustrating their labors, either by assisting the Lucchese secretly\r\nwith money, or by apparently disbanding his own troops, and then sending\r\nthem, as if they were soldiers of fortune, to their relief. He therefore\r\nadvised that they should give up the idea, and behave toward the tyrant\r\nin such a way as to create him as many enemies as possible; for there\r\nwas no better method of reducing Lucca than to let them live under the\r\ntyrant, oppressed and exhausted by him; for, if prudently managed, that\r\ncity would soon get into such a condition that he could not retain it,\r\nand being ignorant or unable to govern itself, it must of necessity fall\r\ninto their power. But he saw that his discourse did not please them, and\r\nthat his words were unheeded; he would, however, predict this to them,\r\nthat they were about to commence a war in which they would expend vast\r\nsums, incur great domestic dangers, and instead of becoming masters of\r\nLucca, they would deliver her from her tyrant, and of a friendly city,\r\nfeeble and oppressed, they would make one free and hostile, and that\r\nin time she would become an obstacle to the greatness of their own\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nThe question having been debated on both sides, they proceeded to vote,\r\nas usual, and of the citizens present only ninety-eight were against the\r\nenterprise. Thus determined in favor of war, they appointed a Council of\r\nTen for its management, and hired forces, both horse and foot. Astorre\r\nGianni and Rinaldo degli Albizzi were appointed commissaries, and\r\nNiccolo Fortebraccio, on agreeing to give up to the Florentines the\r\nplaces he had taken, was engaged to conduct the enterprise as their\r\ncaptain. The commissaries having arrived with the army in the country\r\nof the Lucchese, divided their forces; one part of which, under Astorre,\r\nextended itself along the plain, toward Camaiore and Pietrasanta, while\r\nRinaldo, with the other division, took the direction of the hills,\r\npresuming that when the citizens found themselves deprived of the\r\nsurrounding country, they would easily submit. The proceedings of the\r\ncommissaries were unfortunate, not that they failed to occupy many\r\nplaces, but from the complaints made against them of mismanaging the\r\noperations of the war; and Astorre Gianni had certainly given very\r\nsufficient cause for the charges against him.\r\n\r\nThere is a fertile and populous valley near Pietrasanta, called\r\nSeravezza, whose inhabitants, on learning the arrival of the commissary,\r\npresented themselves before him and begged he would receive them as\r\nfaithful subjects of the Florentine republic. Astorre pretended to\r\naccept their proposal, but immediately ordered his forces to take\r\npossession of all the passes and strong positions of the valley,\r\nassembled the men in the principal church, took them all prisoners, and\r\nthen caused his people to plunder and destroy the whole country, with\r\nthe greatest avarice and cruelty, making no distinction in favor of\r\nconsecrated places, and violating the women, both married and\r\nsingle. These things being known in Florence, displeased not only the\r\nmagistracy, but the whole city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Seravezza appeal to the Signory--Complaints against\r\nRinaldo degli Albizzi--The commissaries changed--Filippo Brunelleschi\r\nproposes to submerge the country about Lucca--Pagolo Guinigi asks\r\nassistance of the duke of Milan--The duke sends Francesco Sforza--Pagolo\r\nGuinigi expelled--The Florentines routed by the forces of the duke--The\r\nacquisitions of the Lucchese after the victory--Conclusion of the war.\r\n\r\nA few of the inhabitants of the valley of Seravezza, having escaped the\r\nhands of the commissary, came to Florence and acquainted every one in\r\nthe streets with their miserable situation; and by the advice of those\r\nwho, either through indignation at his wickedness or from being of\r\nthe opposite party, wished to punish the commissary, they went to the\r\nCouncil of Ten, and requested an audience. This being granted, one of\r\nthem spoke to the following effect: \"We feel assured, magnificent lords,\r\nthat we shall find credit and compassion from the Signory, when you\r\nlearn how your commissary has taken possession of our country, and in\r\nwhat manner he has treated us. Our valley, as the memorials of your\r\nancient houses abundantly testify, was always Guelphic, and has\r\noften proved a secure retreat to your citizens when persecuted by the\r\nGhibellines. Our forefathers, and ourselves too, have always revered the\r\nname of this noble republic as the leader and head of their party. While\r\nthe Lucchese were Guelphs we willingly submitted to their government;\r\nbut when enslaved by the tyrant, who forsook his old friends to join\r\nthe Ghibelline faction, we have obeyed him more through force than good\r\nwill. And God knows how often we have prayed, that we might have an\r\nopportunity of showing our attachment to our ancient party. But how\r\nblind are mankind in their wishes! That which we desired for our safety\r\nhas proved our destruction. As soon as we learned that your ensigns were\r\napproaching, we hastened to meet your commissary, not as an enemy,\r\nbut as the representative of our ancient lords; placed our valley, our\r\npersons, and our fortunes in his hands, and commended them to his good\r\nfaith, believing him to possess the soul, if not of a Florentine, at\r\nleast of a man. Your lordships will forgive us; for, unable to support\r\nhis cruelties, we are compelled to speak. Your commissary has nothing of\r\nthe man but the shape, nor of a Florentine but the name; a more deadly\r\npest, a more savage beast, a more horrid monster never was imagined in\r\nthe human mind; for, having assembled us in our church under pretense\r\nof wishing to speak with us, he made us prisoners. He then burned and\r\ndestroyed the whole valley, carried off our property, ravaged every\r\nplace, destroyed everything, violated the women, dishonored the virgins,\r\nand dragging them from the arms of their mothers, gave them up to the\r\nbrutality of his soldiery. If by any injury to the Florentine people we\r\nmerited such treatment, or if he had vanquished us armed in our defense,\r\nwe should have less reason for complaint; we should have accused\r\nourselves, and thought that either our mismanagement or our arrogance\r\nhad deservedly brought the calamity upon us; but after having freely\r\npresented ourselves to him unarmed, to be robbed and plundered with such\r\nunfeeling barbarity, is more than we can bear. And though we might\r\nhave filled Lombardy with complaints and charges against this city, and\r\nspread the story of our misfortunes over the whole of Italy, we did\r\nnot wish to slander so just and pious a republic, with the baseness and\r\nperfidy of one wicked citizen, whose cruelty and avarice, had we known\r\nthem before our ruin was complete, we should have endeavored to satiate\r\n(though indeed they are insatiable), and with one-half of our property\r\nhave saved the rest. But the opportunity is past; we are compelled to\r\nhave recourse to you, and beg that you will succor the distresses of\r\nyour subjects, that others may not be deterred by our example from\r\nsubmitting themselves to your authority. And if our extreme distress\r\ncannot prevail with you to assist us, be induced, by your fear of the\r\nwrath of God, who has seen his temple plundered and burned, and his\r\npeople betrayed in his bosom.\" Having said this they threw themselves\r\non the ground, crying aloud, and praying that their property and their\r\ncountry might be restored to them; and that if the Signory could not\r\ngive them back their honor, they would, at least, restore husbands to\r\ntheir wives, and children to their fathers. The atrocity of the affair\r\nhaving already been made known, and now by the living words of\r\nthe sufferers presented before them, excited the compassion of the\r\nmagistracy. They ordered the immediate return of Astorre, who being\r\ntried, was found guilty, and admonished. They sought the goods of the\r\ninhabitants of Seravezza; all that could be recovered was restored\r\nto them, and as time and circumstance gave opportunity, they were\r\ncompensated for the rest.\r\n\r\nComplaints were made against Rinaldo degli Albizzi, that he carried on\r\nthe war, not for the advantage of the Florentine people, but his own\r\nprivate emolument; that as soon as he was appointed commissary, he lost\r\nall desire to take Lucca, for it was sufficient for him to plunder the\r\ncountry, fill his estates with cattle, and his house with booty; and,\r\nnot content with what his own satellites took, he purchased that of the\r\nsoldiery, so that instead of a commissary he became a merchant. These\r\ncalumnies coming to his ears, disturbed the temper of this proud but\r\nupright man, more than quite became his dignity. He was so exasperated\r\nagainst the citizens and magistracy, that without waiting for or asking\r\npermission, he returned to Florence, and, presenting himself before the\r\nCouncil of Ten, he said that he well knew how difficult and dangerous a\r\nthing it was to serve an unruly people and a divided city, for the\r\none listens to every report, the other pursues improper measures; they\r\nneglect to reward good conduct, and heap censure upon whatever appears\r\ndoubtful; so that victory wins no applause, error is accused by all, and\r\nif vanquished, universal condemnation is incurred; from one's own party\r\nthrough envy, and from enemies through hatred, persecution results. He\r\nconfessed that the baseness of the present calumnies had conquered his\r\npatience and changed the temper of his mind; but he would say, he had\r\nnever, for fear of a false accusation, avoided doing what appeared to\r\nhim beneficial to the city. However, he trusted the magistrates would in\r\nfuture be more ready to defend their fellow-citizens, so that the latter\r\nmight continue anxious to effect the prosperity of their country; that\r\nas it was not customary at Florence to award triumphs for success, they\r\nought at least to be protected from calumny; and that being citizens\r\nthemselves, and at any moment liable to false accusations, they might\r\neasily conceive how painful it is to an upright mind to be oppressed\r\nwith slander. The Ten endeavored, as well as circumstances would admit,\r\nto soothe the acerbity of his feelings, and confided the care of the\r\nexpedition to Neri di Gino and Alamanno Salviati, who, instead of\r\noverrunning the country, advanced near to Lucca. As the weather had\r\nbecome extremely cold, the forces established themselves at Campannole,\r\nwhich seemed to the commissaries waste of time; and wishing to draw\r\nnearer the place, the soldiery refused to comply, although the Ten had\r\ninsisted they should pitch their camp before the city, and would not\r\nhear of any excuse.\r\n\r\nAt that time there lived at Florence, a very distinguished architect,\r\nnamed Filippo di Ser Brunelleschi, of whose works our city is full, and\r\nwhose merit was so extraordinary, that after his death his statue\r\nin marble was erected in the principal church, with an inscription\r\nunderneath, which still bears testimony to those who read it, of his\r\ngreat talents. This man pointed out, that in consequence of the relative\r\npositions of the river Serchio and the city of Lucca, the wastes of the\r\nriver might be made to inundate the surrounding country, and place the\r\ncity in a kind of lake. His reasoning on this point appeared so clear,\r\nand the advantage to the besiegers so obvious and inevitable, that the\r\nTen were induced to make the experiment. The result, however, was quite\r\ncontrary to their expectation, and produced the utmost disorder in\r\nthe Florentine camp; for the Lucchese raised high embankments in the\r\ndirection of the ditch made by our people to conduct the waters of the\r\nSerchio, and one night cut through the embankment of the ditch itself,\r\nso that having first prevented the water from taking the course\r\ndesigned by the architect, they now caused it to overflow the plain,\r\nand compelled the Florentines, instead of approaching the city as they\r\nwished, to take a more remote position.\r\n\r\nThe design having failed, the Council of Ten, who had been re-elected,\r\nsent as commissary, Giovanni Guicciardini, who encamped before Lucca,\r\nwith all possible expedition. Pagolo Guinigi finding himself thus\r\nclosely pressed, by the advice of Antonio del Rosso, then representative\r\nof the Siennese at Lucca, sent Salvestro Trento and Leonardo Bonvisi to\r\nMilan, to request assistance from the duke; but finding him indisposed\r\nto comply, they secretly engaged, on the part of the people, to deliver\r\ntheir governor up to him and give him possession of the place; at the\r\nsame time intimating, that if he did not immediately follow this advice,\r\nhe would not long have the opportunity, since it was the intention of\r\nPagolo to surrender the city to the Florentines, who were very anxious\r\nto obtain it. The duke was so much alarmed with this idea, that, setting\r\naside all other considerations, he caused Count Francesco Sforza, who\r\nwas engaged in his service, to make a public request for permission\r\nto go to Naples; and having obtained it, he proceeded with his forces\r\ndirectly to Lucca, though the Florentines, aware of the deception,\r\nand apprehensive of the consequences, had sent to the count, Boccacino\r\nAlamanni, his friend, to frustrate this arrangement. Upon the arrival\r\nof the count at Lucca, the Florentines removed their camp to Librafatta,\r\nand the count proceeded immediately to Pescia, where Pagolo Diacceto\r\nwas lieutenant governor, who, promoted by fear rather than any better\r\nmotive, fled to Pistoia, and if the place had not been defended by\r\nGiovanni Malavolti, to whom the command was intrusted, it would have\r\nbeen lost. The count failing in his attempt went to Borgo a Buggiano\r\nwhich he took, and burned the castle of Stigliano, in the same\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines being informed of these disasters, found they must have\r\nrecourse to those remedies which upon former occasions had often\r\nproved useful. Knowing that with mercenary soldiers, when force is\r\ninsufficient, corruption commonly prevails, they offered the count a\r\nlarge sum of money on condition that he should quit the city, and give\r\nit up to them. The count finding that no more money was to be had from\r\nLucca, resolved to take it of those who had it to dispense, and agreed\r\nwith the Florentines, not to give them Lucca, which for decency he could\r\nnot consent to, but to withdraw his troops, and abandon it, on condition\r\nof receiving fifty thousand ducats; and having made this agreement, to\r\ninduce the Lucchese to excuse him to the duke, he consented that they\r\nshould expel their tyrant.\r\n\r\nAntonio del Rosso, as we remarked above, was Siennese ambassador at\r\nLucca, and with the authority of the count he contrived the ruin of\r\nPagolo Guinigi. The heads of the conspiracy were Pierro Cennami and\r\nGiovanni da Chivizzano. The count resided upon the Serchio, at a short\r\ndistance from the city, and with him was Lanzilao, the son of Pagolo.\r\nThe conspirators, about forty in number, went armed at night in search\r\nof Pagolo, who, on hearing the noise they made, came toward them quite\r\nastonished, and demanded the cause of their visit; to which Piero\r\nCennami replied, that they had long been governed by him, and led\r\nabout against the enemy, to die either by hunger or the sword, but were\r\nresolved to govern themselves for the future, and demanded the keys of\r\nthe city and the treasure. Pagolo said the treasure was consumed, but\r\nthe keys and himself were in their power; he only begged that as his\r\ncommand had begun and continued without bloodshed, it might conclude\r\nin the same manner. Count Francesco conducted Pagolo and his son to the\r\nduke, and they afterward died in prison.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the count having delivered Lucca from her tyrant, and\r\nthe Florentines from their fear of his soldiery, the former prepared for\r\nher defense, and the latter resumed the siege. They appointed the\r\ncount of Urbino to conduct their forces, and he pressed the Lucchese\r\nso closely, that they were again compelled to ask the assistance of the\r\nduke, who dispatched Niccolo Piccinino, under the same pretense as he\r\npreviously sent Count Francesco. The Florentine forces met him on his\r\napproach to Lucca, and at the passage of the Serchio a battle ensued, in\r\nwhich they were routed, the commissary with a few of his men escaping\r\nto Pisa. This defeat filled the Florentines with dismay, and as the\r\nenterprise had been undertaken with the entire approbation of the great\r\nbody of the people, they did not know whom to find fault with, and\r\ntherefore railed against those who had been appointed to the management\r\nof the war, reviving the charges made against Rinaldo. They were,\r\nhowever, more severe against Giovanni Guicciardini than any other,\r\ndeclaring that if he had wished, he might have put a period to the war\r\nat the departure of Count Francesco, but that he had been bribed with\r\nmoney, for he had sent home a large sum, naming the party who had been\r\nintrusted to bring it, and the persons to whom it had been delivered.\r\nThese complaints and accusations were carried to so great a length that\r\nthe captain of the people, induced by the public voice, and pressed by\r\nthe party opposed to the war, summoned him to trial. Giovanni appeared,\r\nthough full of indignation. However his friends, from regard to their\r\nown character, adopted such a course with the Capitano as induced him to\r\nabandon the inquiry.\r\n\r\nAfter this victory, the Lucchese not only recovered the places that had\r\nbelonged to them, but occupied all the country of Pisa except Beintina,\r\nCalcinaja, Livorno, and Librafatta; and, had not a conspiracy been\r\ndiscovered that was formed in Pisa, they would have secured that\r\ncity also. The Florentines again prepared for battle, and appointed\r\nMicheletto, a pupil of Sforza, to be their leader. The duke, on the\r\nother hand, followed up this victory, and that he might bring a greater\r\npower against the Florentines, induced the Genoese, the Siennese, and\r\nthe governor of Piombino, to enter into a league for the defense of\r\nLucca, and to engage Niccolo Piccinino to conduct their forces. Having\r\nby this step declared his design, the Venetians and the Florentines\r\nrenewed their league, and the war was carried on openly in Tuscany and\r\nLombardy, in each of which several battles were fought with variety of\r\nfortune. At length, both sides being wearied out, they came to terms\r\nfor the cessation of hostilities, in May, 1433. By this arrangement\r\nthe Florentines, Lucchese, and Siennese, who had each occupied many\r\nfortresses belonging to the others, gave them all up, and each party\r\nresumed its original possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCosmo de' Medici, his character and mode of proceedings--The greatness\r\nof Cosmo excites the jealousy of the citizens--The opinion of Niccolo\r\nda Uzzano--Scandalous divisions of the Florentines--Death of Niccolo\r\nda Uzzano--Bernardo Guadagni, Gonfalonier, adopts measures against\r\nCosmo--Cosmo arrested in the palace--He is apprehensive of attempts\r\nagainst his life.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the malignant humors of the city were in constant\r\nactivity. Cosmo de' Medici, after the death of Giovanni, engaged more\r\nearnestly in public affairs, and conducted himself with more zeal and\r\nboldness in regard to his friends than his father had done, so that\r\nthose who rejoiced at Giovanni's death, finding what the son was likely\r\nto become, perceived they had no cause for exultation. Cosmo was one\r\nof the most prudent of men; of grave and courteous demeanor, extremely\r\nliberal and humane. He never attempted anything against parties,\r\nor against rulers, but was bountiful to all; and by the unwearied\r\ngenerosity of his disposition, made himself partisans of all ranks of\r\nthe citizens. This mode of proceeding increased the difficulties of\r\nthose who were in the government, and Cosmo himself hoped that by its\r\npursuit he might be able to live in Florence as much respected and\r\nas secure as any other citizen; or if the ambition of his adversaries\r\ncompelled him to adopt a different course, arms and the favor of his\r\nfriends would enable him to become more so. Averardo de' Medici and\r\nPuccio Pucci were greatly instrumental in the establishment of his\r\npower; the former by his boldness, the latter by unusual prudence and\r\nsagacity, contributed to his aggrandizement. Indeed the advice of\r\nwisdom of Puccio were so highly esteemed, that Cosmo's party was rather\r\ndistinguished by the name of Puccio than by his own.\r\n\r\nBy this divided city the enterprise against Lucca was undertaken; and\r\nthe bitterness of party spirit, instead of being abated, increased.\r\nAlthough the friends of Cosmo had been in favor of it, many of the\r\nadverse faction were sent to assist in the management, as being men of\r\ngreater influence in the state. Averardo de' Medici and the rest being\r\nunable to prevent this, endeavored with all their might to calumniate\r\nthem; and when any unfavorable circumstance occurred (and there were\r\nmany), fortune and the exertions of the enemy were never supposed to\r\nbe the causes, but solely the want of capacity in the commissary. This\r\ndisposition aggravated the offenses of Astorre Gianni; this excited the\r\nindignation of Rinaldo degli Albizzi, and made him resign his commission\r\nwithout leave; this, too, compelled the captain of the people to require\r\nthe appearance of Giovanni Guicciardini, and from this arose all\r\nthe other charges which were made against the magistrates and the\r\ncommissaries. Real evils were magnified, unreal ones feigned, and the\r\ntrue and the false were equally believed by the people, who were almost\r\nuniversally their foes.\r\n\r\nAll these events and extraordinary modes of proceeding were perfectly\r\nknown to Niccolo da Uzzano and the other leaders of the party; and they\r\nhad often consulted together for the purpose of finding a remedy, but\r\nwithout effect; though they were aware of the danger of allowing them\r\nto increase, and the great difficulty that would attend any attempt\r\nto remove or abate them. Niccolo da Uzzano was the earliest to take\r\noffense; and while the war was proceeding without, and these troubles\r\nwithin, Niccolo Barbadoro desirous of inducing him to consent to the\r\nruin of Cosmo, waited upon him at his house; and finding him alone in\r\nhis study, and very pensive, endeavored, with the best reasons he could\r\nadvance, to persuade him to agree with Rinaldo on Cosmo's expulsion.\r\nNiccolo da Uzzano replied as follows: \"It would be better for thee and\r\nthy house, as well as for our republic, if thou and those who follow\r\nthee in this opinion had beards of silver instead of gold, as is said of\r\nthee; for advice proceeding from the hoary head of long experience would\r\nbe wiser and of greater service to all. It appears to me, that those who\r\ntalk of driving Cosmo out of Florence would do well to consider what is\r\ntheir strength, and what that of Cosmo. You have named one party,\r\nthat of the nobility, the other that of the plebeians. If the fact\r\ncorresponded with the name, the victory would still be most uncertain,\r\nand the example of the ancient nobility of this city, who were destroyed\r\nby the plebeians, ought rather to impress us with fear than with hope.\r\nWe have, however, still further cause for apprehension from the division\r\nof our party, and the union of our adversaries. In the first place, Neri\r\ndi Gino and Nerone di Nigi, two of our principal citizens, have never\r\nso fully declared their sentiments as to enable us to determine whether\r\nthey are most our friends our those of our opponents. There are many\r\nfamilies, even many houses, divided; many are opposed to us through\r\nenvy of brothers or relatives. I will recall to your recollection two\r\nor three of the most important; you may think of the others at your\r\nleisure. Of the sons of Maso degli Albizzi, Luca, from envy of Rinaldo,\r\nhas thrown himself into their hands. In the house of Guicciardini, of\r\nthe sons of Luigi, Piero is the enemy of Giovanni and in favor of our\r\nadversaries. Tommaso and Niccolo Soderini openly oppose us on account of\r\ntheir hatred of their uncle Francesco. So that if we consider well what\r\nwe are, and what our enemies, I cannot see why we should be called NOBLE\r\nany more than they. If it is because they are followed by the plebeians,\r\nwe are in a worse condition on that account, and they in a better; for\r\nwere it to come either to arms or to votes, we should not be able to\r\nresist them. True it is, we still preserve our dignity, our precedence,\r\nthe priority of our position, but this arises from the former reputation\r\nof the government, which has now continued fifty years; and whenever we\r\ncome to the proof, or they discover our weakness we shall lose it. If\r\nyou were to say, the justice of our cause ought to augment our influence\r\nand diminish theirs I answer, that this justice requires to be perceived\r\nand believed by others as well as by ourselves, but this is not the\r\ncase; for the justice of our cause is wholly founded upon our suspicion\r\nthat Cosmo designs to make himself prince of the city. And although we\r\nentertain this suspicion and suppose it to be correct, others have it\r\nnot; but what is worse, they charge us with the very design of which\r\nwe accuse him. Those actions of Cosmo which lead us to suspect him are,\r\nthat he lends money indiscriminately, and not to private persons\r\nonly, but to the public; and not to Florentines only, but to the\r\n_condottieri_, the soldiers of fortune. Besides, he assists any\r\ncitizen who requires magisterial aid; and, by the universal interest\r\nhe possesses in the city, raises first one friend and then another to\r\nhigher grades of honor. Therefore, to adduce our reasons for expelling\r\nhim, would be to say that he is kind, generous, liberal, and beloved\r\nby all. Now tell me, what law is there which forbids, disapproves, or\r\ncondemns men for being pious, liberal, and benevolent? And though they\r\nare all modes adopted by those who aim at sovereignty, they are not\r\nbelieved to be such, nor have we sufficient power to make them to be\r\nso esteemed; for our conduct has robbed us of confidence, and the city,\r\nnaturally partial and (having always lived in faction) corrupt, cannot\r\nlend its attention to such charges. But even if we were successful in\r\nan attempt to expel him (which might easily happen under a favorable\r\nSignory), how could we (being surrounded by his innumerable friends, who\r\nwould constantly reproach us, and ardently desire to see him again in\r\nthe city) prevent his return? It would be impossible for they being so\r\nnumerous, and having the good will of all upon their side, we should\r\nnever be secure from them. And as many of his first discovered friends\r\nas you might expel, so many enemies would you make, so that in a short\r\ntime he would return, and the result would be simply this, that we had\r\ndriven him out a good man and he had returned to us a bad one; for his\r\nnature would be corrupted by those who recalled him, and he, being under\r\nobligation, could not oppose them. Or should you design to put him to\r\ndeath, you could not attain your purpose with the magistrates, for his\r\nwealth, and the corruption of your minds, will always save him. But let\r\nus suppose him put to death, or that being banished, he did not return,\r\nI cannot see how the condition of our republic would be ameliorated; for\r\nif we relieve her from Cosmo, we at once make her subject to Rinaldo,\r\nand it is my most earnest desire that no citizen may ever, in power and\r\nauthority, surpass the rest. But if one of these must prevail, I know of\r\nno reason that should make me prefer Rinaldo to Cosmo. I shall only\r\nsay, may God preserve the city from any of her citizens usurping the\r\nsovereignty, but if our sins have deserved this, in mercy save us from\r\nRinaldo. I pray thee, therefore, do not advise the adoption of a course\r\non every account pernicious, nor imagine that, in union with a few, you\r\nwould be able to oppose the will of the many; for the citizens, some\r\nfrom ignorance and others from malice, are ready to sell the republic at\r\nany time, and fortune has so much favored them, that they have found a\r\npurchaser. Take my advice then; endeavor to live moderately; and with\r\nregard to liberty, you will find as much cause for suspicion in our\r\nparty as in that of our adversaries. And when troubles arise, being of\r\nneither side, you will be agreeable to both, and you will thus provide\r\nfor your own comfort and do no injury to any.\"\r\n\r\nThese words somewhat abated the eagerness of Barbadoro, so that\r\ntranquillity prevailed during the war with Lucca. But this being\r\nended, and Niccolo da Uzzano dead, the city being at peace and under no\r\nrestraint, unhealthy humors increased with fearful rapidity. Rinaldo,\r\nconsidering himself now the leader of the party, constantly entreated\r\nand urged every citizen whom he thought likely to be Gonfalonier, to\r\ntake up arms and deliver the country from him who, from the malevolence\r\nof a few and the ignorance of the multitude, was inevitably reducing it\r\nto slavery. These practices of Rinaldo, and those of the contrary side,\r\nkept the city full of apprehension, so that whenever a magistracy was\r\ncreated, the numbers of each party composing it were made publicly\r\nknown, and upon drawing for the Signory the whole city was aroused.\r\nEvery case brought before the magistrates, however trivial, was made a\r\nsubject of contention among them. Secrets were divulged, good and evil\r\nalike became objects of favor and opposition, the benevolent and the\r\nwicked were alike assailed, and no magistrate fulfilled the duties of\r\nhis office with integrity.\r\n\r\nIn this state of confusion, Rinaldo, anxious to abate the power\r\nof Cosmo, and knowing that Bernardo Guadagni was likely to become\r\nGonfalonier, paid his arrears of taxes, that he might not, by being\r\nindebted to the public, be incapacitated for holding the office. The\r\ndrawing soon after took place, and fortune, opposed to our welfare,\r\ncaused Bernardo to be appointed for the months of September and October.\r\nRinaldo immediately waited upon him, and intimated how much the party\r\nof the nobility, and all who wished for repose, rejoiced to find he\r\nhad attained that dignity; that it now rested with him to act in such a\r\nmanner as to realize their pleasing expectations. He then enlarged upon\r\nthe danger of disunion, and endeavored to show that there was no means\r\nof attaining the blessing of unity but by the destruction of Cosmo, for\r\nhe alone, by the popularity acquired with his enormous wealth, kept them\r\ndepressed; that he was already so powerful, that if not hindered, he\r\nwould soon become prince, and that it was the part of a good citizen, in\r\norder to prevent such a calamity, to assemble the people in the piazza,\r\nand restore liberty to his country. Rinaldo then reminded the new\r\nGonfalonier how Salvestro de' Medici was able, though unjustly, to\r\nrestrain the power of the Guelphs, to whom, by the blood of their\r\nancestors, shed in its cause, the government rightly belonged; and\r\nargued that what he was able unjustly to accomplish against so many,\r\nmight surely be easily performed with justice in its favor against one!\r\nHe encouraged him with the assurance that their friends would be ready\r\nin arms to support him; that he need not regard the plebeians, who\r\nadored Cosmo, since their assistance would be of no greater avail than\r\nGiorgio Scali had found it on a similar occasion; and that with regard\r\nto his wealth, no apprehension was necessary, for when he was under\r\nthe power of the Signory, his riches would be so too. In conclusion, he\r\naverred that this course would unite and secure the republic, and crown\r\nthe Gonfalonier with glory. Bernardo briefly replied, that he thought\r\nit necessary to act exactly as Rinaldo had advised, and that as the time\r\nwas suitable for action, he should provide himself with forces, being\r\nassured from what Rinaldo had said, he would be supported by his\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\nBernardo entered upon the duties of his office, prepared his followers,\r\nand having concerted with Rinaldo, summoned Cosmo, who, though many\r\nfriends dissuaded him from it, obeyed the call, trusting more to his own\r\ninnocence than to the mercy of the Signory. As soon as he had entered\r\nthe palace he was arrested. Rinaldo, with a great number of armed men,\r\nand accompanied by nearly the whole of his party, proceeded to the\r\npiazza, when the Signory assembled the people, and created a Balia of\r\ntwo hundred persons for the reformation of the city. With the least\r\npossible delay they entered upon the consideration of reform, and of the\r\nlife or death of Cosmo. Many wished him to be banished, others to be put\r\nto death, and several were silent, either from compassion toward him\r\nor for fear of the rest, so that these differences prevented them from\r\ncoming to any conclusion.\r\n\r\nThere is an apartment in the tower of the palace which occupies the\r\nwhole of one floor, and is called the Alberghettino, in which Cosmo was\r\nconfined, under the charge of Federigo Malavolti. In this place, hearing\r\nthe assembly of the Councils, the noise of arms which proceeded from the\r\npiazza, and the frequent ringing of the bell to assemble the Balia, he\r\nwas greatly apprehensive for his safety, but still more less his private\r\nenemies should cause him to be put to death in some unusual manner.\r\nHe scarcely took any food, so that in four days he ate only a small\r\nquantity of bread, Federigo, observing his anxiety, said to him, \"Cosmo,\r\nyou are afraid of being poisoned, and are evidently hastening your end\r\nwith hunger. You wrong me if you think I would be a party to such an\r\natrocious act. I do not imagine your life to be in much danger, since\r\nyou have so many friends both within the palace and without; but if you\r\nshould eventually lose it, be assured they will use some other medium\r\nthan myself for that purpose, for I will never imbue my hands in the\r\nblood of any, still less in yours, who never injured me; therefore cheer\r\nup, take some food, and preserve your life for your friends and your\r\ncountry. And that you may do so with greater assurance, I will partake\r\nof your meals with you.\" These words were of great relief to Cosmo, who,\r\nwith tears in his eyes, embraced and kissed Federigo, earnestly thanking\r\nhim for so kind and affectionate conduct, and promising, if ever the\r\nopportunity were given him, he would not be ungrateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCosmo is banished to Padua--Rinaldo degli Albizzi attempts to\r\nrestore the nobility--New disturbances occasioned by Rinaldo degli\r\nAlbizzi--Rinaldo takes arms against the Signory--His designs are\r\ndisconcerted--Pope Eugenius in Florence--He endeavors to reconcile the\r\nparties--Cosmo is recalled--Rinaldo and his party banished--Glorious\r\nreturn of Cosmo.\r\n\r\nCosmo in some degree recovered his spirits, and while the citizens\r\nwere disputing about him, Federigo, by way of recreation, brought an\r\nacquaintance of the Gonfalonier to take supper with him, an amusing and\r\nfacetious person, whose name was Il Farnagaccio. The repast being nearly\r\nover, Cosmo, who thought he might turn this visit to advantage, for\r\nhe knew the man very intimately, gave a sign to Federigo to leave the\r\napartment, and he, guessing the cause, under pretense of going for\r\nsomething that was wanted on the table, left them together. Cosmo, after\r\na few friendly expressions addressed to Il Farnagaccio, gave him a small\r\nslip of paper, and desired him to go to the director of the hospital of\r\nSanta Maria Nuova, for one thousand one hundred ducats; he was to take\r\nthe hundred for himself, and carry the thousand to the Gonfalonier,\r\nand beg that he would take some suitable occasion of coming to see\r\nhim. Farnagaccio undertook the commission, the money was paid, Bernardo\r\nbecame more humane, and Cosmo was banished to Padua, contrary to the\r\nwish of Rinaldo, who earnestly desired his death. Averardo and many\r\nothers of the house of Medici were also banished, and with them Puccio\r\nand Giovanni Pucci. To silence those who were dissatisfied with the\r\nbanishment of Cosmo, they endowed with the power of a Balia, the Eight\r\nof War and the Capitano of the People. After his sentence, Cosmo on the\r\nthird of October, 1433, came before the Signory, by whom the boundary\r\nto which he was restricted was specified; and they advised him to avoid\r\npassing it, unless he wished them to proceed with greater severity both\r\nagainst himself and his property. Cosmo received his sentence with a\r\ncheerful look, assuring the Signory that wherever they determined to\r\nsend him, he would willingly remain. He earnestly begged, that as they\r\nhad preserved his life they would protect it, for he knew there were\r\nmany in the piazza who were desirous to take it; and assured them, that\r\nwherever he might be, himself and his means were entirely at the service\r\nof the city, the people, and the Signory. He was respectfully attended\r\nby the Gonfalonier, who retained him in the palace till night, then\r\nconducted him to his own house to supper, and caused him to be escorted\r\nby a strong armed force to his place of banishment. Wherever the\r\ncavalcade passed, Cosmo was honorably received, and was publicly visited\r\nby the Venetians, not as an exile, but with all the respect due to one\r\nin the highest station.\r\n\r\nFlorence, widowed of so great a citizen, one so generally beloved,\r\nseemed to be universally sunk in despondency; victors and the vanquished\r\nwere alike in fear. Rinaldo, as if inspired with a presage of his future\r\ncalamities, in order not to appear deficient to himself or his party,\r\nassembled many citizens, his friends, and informed them that he foresaw\r\ntheir approaching ruin for having allowed themselves to be overcome by\r\nthe prayers, the tears, and the money of their enemies; and that they\r\ndid not seem aware they would soon themselves have to entreat and weep,\r\nwhen their prayers would not be listened to, or their tears excite\r\ncompassion; and that of the money received, they would have to restore\r\nthe principal, and pay the interest in tortures, exile, and death; that\r\nit would have been much better for them to have done nothing than to\r\nhave left Cosmo alive, and his friends in Florence; for great offenders\r\nought either to remain untouched, or be destroyed; that there was now\r\nno remedy but to strengthen themselves in the city, so that upon the\r\nrenewed attempts of their enemies, which would soon take place, they\r\nmight drive them out with arms, since they had not sufficient civil\r\nauthority to expel them. The remedy to be adopted, he said, was one that\r\nhe had long before advocated, which was to regain the friendship of the\r\ngrandees, restoring and conceding to them all the honors of the city,\r\nand thus make themselves strong with that party, since their adversaries\r\nhad joined the plebeians. That by this means they would become the more\r\npowerful side, for they would possess greater energy, more comprehensive\r\ntalent and an augmented share of influence; and that if this last and\r\nonly remedy were not adopted, he knew not what other means could be\r\nmade use of to preserve the government among so many enemies, or prevent\r\ntheir own ruin and that of the city.\r\n\r\nMariotto Baldovinetti, one of the assembly, was opposed to this plan, on\r\naccount of the pride and insupportable nature of the nobility; and said,\r\nthat it would be folly to place themselves again under such inevitable\r\ntyranny for the sake of avoiding imaginary dangers from the plebeians.\r\nRinaldo, finding his advice unfavorably received, vexed at his own\r\nmisfortune and that of his party, imputed the whole to heaven itself,\r\nwhich had resolved upon it, rather than to human ignorance and blunders.\r\nIn this juncture of affairs, no remedial measure being attempted, a\r\nletter was found written by Agnolo Acciajuoli to Cosmo, acquainting\r\nhim with the disposition of the city in his favor, and advising him, if\r\npossible, to excite a war, and gain the friendship of Neri di Gino; for\r\nhe imagined the city to be in want of money, and as she would not find\r\nanyone to serve her, the remembrance of him would be revived in the\r\nminds of the citizens, and they would desire his return; and that if\r\nNeri were detached from Rinaldo, the party of the latter would be so\r\nweakened, as to be unable to defend themselves. This letter coming to\r\nthe hands of the magistrates, Agnolo was taken, put to the torture, and\r\nsent into exile. This example, however, did not at all deter Cosmo's\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIt was now almost a year since Cosmo had been banished, and the end of\r\nAugust, 1434, being come, Niccolo di Cocco was drawn Gonfalonier for\r\nthe two succeeding months, and with him eight signors, all partisans of\r\nCosmo. This struck terror into Rinaldo and his party; and as it is usual\r\nfor three days to elapse before the new Signory assume the magistracy\r\nand the old resign their authority, Rinaldo again called together\r\nthe heads of his party. He endeavored to show them their certain and\r\nimmediate danger, and that their only remedy was to take arms, and cause\r\nDonato Velluti, who was yet Gonfalonier, to assemble the people in the\r\npiazza and create a Balia. He would then deprive the new Signory of the\r\nmagistracy, appoint another, burn the present balloting purses, and by\r\nmeans of a new Squittini, provide themselves with friends. Many thought\r\nthis course safe and requisite; others, that it was too violent, and\r\nlikely to be attended with great evil. Among those who disliked it was\r\nPalla Strozzi, a peaceable, gentle, and humane person, better adapted\r\nfor literary pursuits than for restraining a party, or opposing civil\r\nstrife. He said that bold and crafty resolutions seem promising at\r\ntheir commencement, but are afterward found difficult to execute, and\r\ngenerally pernicious at their conclusion; that he thought the fear of\r\nexternal wars (the duke's forces being upon the confines of Romagna),\r\nwould occupy the minds of the Signory more than internal dissensions;\r\nbut, still, if any attempt should be made, and it could not take place\r\nunnoticed, they would have sufficient time to take arms, and adopt\r\nwhatever measures might be found necessary for the common good, which\r\nbeing done upon necessity, would occasion less excitement among the\r\npeople and less danger to themselves. It was therefore concluded,\r\nthat the new Signory should come in; that their proceedings should be\r\nwatched, and if they were found attempting anything against the party,\r\neach should take arms, and meet in the piazza of San Pulinari, situated\r\nnear the palace, and whence they might proceed wherever it was found\r\nnecessary. Having come to this conclusion, Rinaldo's friends separated.\r\n\r\nThe new Signory entered upon their office, and the Gonfalonier, in order\r\nto acquire reputation, and deter those who might intend to oppose him,\r\nsent Donato Velluti, his predecessor, to prison, upon the charge of\r\nhaving applied the public money to his own use. He then endeavored to\r\nsound his colleagues with respect to Cosmo: seeing them desirous of his\r\nreturn, he communicated with the leaders of the Medici party, and,\r\nby their advice, summoned the hostile chiefs, Rinaldo degli Albizzi,\r\nRidolfo Peruzzi, and Niccolo Barbadoro. After this citation, Rinaldo\r\nthought further delay would be dangerous: he therefore left his house\r\nwith a great number of armed men, and was soon joined by Ridolfo Peruzzi\r\nand Niccolo Barbadoro. The force accompanying them was composed of\r\nseveral citizens and a great number of disbanded soldiers then in\r\nFlorence: and all assembled according to appointment in the piazza of\r\nSan Pulinari. Palla Strozzi and Giovanni Guicciardini, though each had\r\nassembled a large number of men, kept in their houses; and therefore\r\nRinaldo sent a messenger to request their attendance and to reprove\r\ntheir delay. Giovanni replied, that he should lend sufficient aid\r\nagainst their enemies, if by remaining at home he could prevent his\r\nbrother Piero from going to the defense of the palace. After many\r\nmessages Palla came to San Pulinari on horseback, accompanied by two\r\nof his people on foot, and unarmed. Rinaldo, on meeting him, sharply\r\nreproved him for his negligence, declaring that his refusal to come with\r\nthe others arose either from defect of principle or want of courage;\r\nboth of which charges should be avoided by all who wished to preserve\r\nsuch a character as he had hitherto possessed; and that if he thought\r\nthis abominable conduct to his party would induce their enemies when\r\nvictorious to spare him from death or exile, he deceived himself; but\r\nfor himself (Rinaldo) whatever might happen, he had the consolation of\r\nknowing, that previously to the crisis he had never neglected his\r\nduty in council, and that when it occurred he had used every possible\r\nexertion to repel it with arms; but that Palla and the others would\r\nexperience aggravated remorse when they considered they had upon three\r\noccasions betrayed their country; first when they saved Cosmo; next when\r\nthey disregarded his advice; and now the third time by not coming armed\r\nin her defense according to their engagement. To these reproaches Palla\r\nmade no reply audible to those around, but, muttering something as he\r\nleft them, returned to his house.\r\n\r\nThe Signory, knowing Rinaldo and his party had taken arms, finding\r\nthemselves abandoned, caused the palace to be shut up, and having no\r\none to consult they knew not what course to adopt. However, Rinaldo,\r\nby delaying his coming to the piazza, having waited in expectation of\r\nforces which did not join him, lost the opportunity of victory, gave\r\nthem courage to provide for their defense, and allowed many others\r\nto join them, who advised that means should be used to induce their\r\nadversaries to lay down their arms. Thereupon, some of the least\r\nsuspected, went on the part of the Signory to Rinaldo, and said,\r\nthey did not know what occasion they had given his friends for thus\r\nassembling in arms; that they never had any intention of offending him,\r\nand if they had spoken of Cosmo, they had no design of recalling him; so\r\nif their fears were thus occasioned they might at once be dispelled, for\r\nthat if they came to the palace they would be graciously received, and\r\nall their complaints attended to. These words produced no change in\r\nRinaldo's purpose; he bade them provide for their safety by resigning\r\ntheir offices, and said that then the government of the city would be\r\nreorganized, for the mutual benefit of all.\r\n\r\nIt rarely happens, where authorities are equal and opinions contrary,\r\nthat any good resolution is adopted. Ridolfo Peruzzi, moved by the\r\ndiscourse of the citizens, said, that all he desired was to prevent\r\nthe return of Cosmo, and this being granted to them seemed a sufficient\r\nvictory; nor would he, to obtain a greater, fill the city with blood; he\r\nwould therefore obey the Signory; and accordingly went with his people\r\nto the palace, where he was received with a hearty welcome. Thus\r\nRinaldo's delay at San Pulinari, Palla's want of courage, and Ridolfo's\r\ndesertion, deprived their party of all chance of success; while\r\nthe ardor of the citizens abated, and the pope's authority did not\r\ncontribute to its revival.\r\n\r\nPope Eugenius was at this time at Florence, having been driven from Rome\r\nby the people. These disturbances coming to his knowledge, he thought\r\nit a duty suitable to his pastoral office to appease them, and sent\r\nthe patriarch Giovanni Vitelleschi, Rinaldo's most intimate friend, to\r\nentreat the latter to come to an interview with him, as he trusted\r\nhe had sufficient influence with the Signory to insure his safety\r\nand satisfaction, without injury or bloodshed to the citizens. By his\r\nfriend's persuasion, Rinaldo proceeded with all his followers to Santa\r\nMaria Nuova, where the pope resided. Eugenius gave him to understand,\r\nthat the Signory had empowered him to settle the differences between\r\nthem, and that all would be arranged to his satisfaction, if he laid\r\ndown his arms. Rinaldo, having witnessed Palla's want of zeal, and the\r\nfickleness of Ridolfo Peruzzi, and no better course being open to him,\r\nplaced himself in the pope's hands, thinking that at all events the\r\nauthority of his holiness would insure his safety. Eugenius then sent\r\nword to Niccolo Barbadoro, and the rest who remained without, that they\r\nwere to lay down their arms, for Rinaldo was remaining with the\r\npontiff, to arrange terms of agreement with the signors; upon which they\r\nimmediately dispersed, and laid aside their weapons.\r\n\r\nThe Signory, seeing their adversaries disarmed, continued to negotiate\r\nan arrangement by means of the pope; but at the same time sent secretly\r\nto the mountains of Pistoia for infantry, which, with what other forces\r\nthey could collect, were brought into Florence by night. Having taken\r\npossession of all the strong positions in the city, they assembled the\r\npeople in the piazza and created a new balia, which, without delay,\r\nrestored Cosmo and those who had been exiled with him to their country;\r\nand banished, of the opposite party, Rinaldo degli Albizzi, Ridolfo\r\nPeruzzi, Niccolo Barbadoro, and Palla Strozzi, with so many other\r\ncitizens, that there were few places in Italy which did not contain\r\nsome, and many others beyond her limits were full of them. By this and\r\nsimilar occurrences, Florence was deprived of men of worth, and of much\r\nwealth and industry.\r\n\r\nThe pope, seeing such misfortunes befall those who by his entreaties\r\nwere induced to lay down their arms, was greatly dissatisfied, and\r\ncondoled with Rinaldo on the injuries he had received through his\r\nconfidence in him, but advised him to be patient, and hope for some\r\nfavorable turn of fortune. Rinaldo replied, \"The want of confidence in\r\nthose who ought to have trusted me, and the great trust I have reposed\r\nin you, have ruined both me and my party. But I blame myself principally\r\nfor having thought that you, who were expelled from your own country,\r\ncould preserve me in mine. I have had sufficient experience of the\r\nfreaks of fortune; and as I have never trusted greatly to prosperity, I\r\nshall suffer less inconvenience from adversity; and I know that when she\r\npleases she can become more favorable. But if she should never change, I\r\nshall not be very desirous of living in a city in which individuals\r\nare more powerful than the laws; for that country alone is desirable in\r\nwhich property and friends may be safely enjoyed, not one where they may\r\neasily be taken from us, and where friends, from fear of losing their\r\nproperty, are compelled to abandon each other in their greatest need.\r\nBesides, it has always been less painful to good men to hear of the\r\nmisfortunes of their country than to witness them; and an honorable\r\nexile is always held in greater esteem than slavery at home.\" He then\r\nleft the pope, and, full of indignation, blaming himself, his own\r\nmeasures, and the coldness of his friends, went into exile.\r\n\r\nCosmo, on the other hand, being informed of his recall, returned to\r\nFlorence; and it has seldom occurred that any citizen, coming home\r\ntriumphant from victory, was received by so vast a concourse of people,\r\nor such unqualified demonstrations of regard as he was upon his\r\nreturn from banishment; for by universal consent he was hailed as the\r\nbenefactor of the people, and the FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe vicissitudes of empires--The state of Italy--The military factions\r\nof Sforza and Braccio--The Bracceschi and the Sforzeschi attack the\r\npope, who is expelled by the Romans--War between the pope and the duke\r\nof Milan--The Florentines and the Venetians assist the pope--Peace\r\nbetween the pope and the duke of Milan--Tyranny practiced by the party\r\nfavorable to the Medici.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, that provinces amid the vicissitudes to which they\r\nare subject, pass from order into confusion, and afterward recur to a\r\nstate of order again; for the nature of mundane affairs not allowing\r\nthem to continue in an even course, when they have arrived at their\r\ngreatest perfection, they soon begin to decline. In the same manner,\r\nhaving been reduced by disorder, and sunk to their utmost state of\r\ndepression, unable to descend lower, they, of necessity, reascend;\r\nand thus from good they gradually decline to evil, and from evil again\r\nreturn to good. The reason is, that valor produces peace; peace, repose;\r\nrepose, disorder; disorder, ruin; so from disorder order springs; from\r\norder virtue, and from this, glory and good fortune. Hence, wise men\r\nhave observed, that the age of literary excellence is subsequent to that\r\nof distinction in arms; and that in cities and provinces, great warriors\r\nare produced before philosophers. Arms having secured victory, and\r\nvictory peace, the buoyant vigor of the martial mind cannot be enfeebled\r\nby a more excusable indulgence than that of letters; nor can indolence,\r\nwith any greater or more dangerous deceit, enter a well regulated\r\ncommunity. Cato was aware of this when the philosophers, Diogenes and\r\nCarneades, were sent ambassadors to the senate by the Athenians; for\r\nperceiving with what earnest admiration the Roman youth began to follow\r\nthem, and knowing the evils that might result to his country from this\r\nspecious idleness, he enacted that no philosopher should be allowed\r\nto enter Rome. Provinces by this means sink to ruin, from which, men's\r\nsufferings having made them wiser, they again recur to order, if they\r\nbe not overwhelmed by some extraordinary force. These causes made Italy,\r\nfirst under the ancient Tuscans, and afterward under the Romans, by\r\nturns happy and unhappy; and although nothing has subsequently arisen\r\nfrom the ruins of Rome at all corresponding to her ancient greatness\r\n(which under a well-organized monarchy might have been gloriously\r\neffected), still there was so much bravery and intelligence in some of\r\nthe new cities and governments that afterward sprang up, that although\r\nnone ever acquired dominion over the rest, they were, nevertheless, so\r\nbalanced and regulated among themselves, as to enable them to live in\r\nfreedom, and defend their country from the barbarians.\r\n\r\nAmong these governments, the Florentines, although they possessed a\r\nsmaller extent of territory, were not inferior to any in power and\r\nauthority; for being situated in the middle of Italy, wealthy, and\r\nprepared for action, they either defended themselves against such as\r\nthought proper to assail them, or decided victory in favor of those\r\nto whom they became allies. From the valor, therefore, of these new\r\ngovernments, if no seasons occurred of long-continued peace, neither\r\nwere any exposed to the calamities of war; for that cannot be called\r\npeace in which states frequently assail each other with arms, nor can\r\nthose be considered wars in which no men are slain, cities plundered,\r\nor sovereignties overthrown; for the practice of arms fell into such a\r\nstate of decay, that wars were commenced without fear, continued without\r\ndanger, and concluded without loss. Thus the military energy which is\r\nin other countries exhausted by a long peace, was wasted in Italy by\r\nthe contemptible manner in which hostilities were carried on, as will be\r\nclearly seen in the events to be described from 1434 to 1494, from which\r\nit will appear how the barbarians were again admitted into Italy, and\r\nshe again sunk under subjection to them. Although the transactions of\r\nour princes at home and abroad will not be viewed with admiration of\r\ntheir virtue and greatness like those of the ancients, perhaps they may\r\non other accounts be regarded with no less interest, seeing what\r\nmasses of high spirited people were kept in restraint by such weak and\r\ndisorderly forces. And if, in detailing the events which took place\r\nin this wasted world, we shall not have to record the bravery of the\r\nsoldier, the prudence of the general, or the patriotism of the citizen,\r\nit will be seen with what artifice, deceit, and cunning, princes,\r\nwarriors, and leaders of republics conducted themselves, to support a\r\nreputation they never deserved. This, perhaps, will not be less useful\r\nthan a knowledge of ancient history; for, if the latter excites the\r\nliberal mind to imitation, the former will show what ought to be avoided\r\nand decried.\r\n\r\nItaly was reduced to such a condition by her rulers, that when, by\r\nconsent of her princes, peace was restored, it was soon disturbed by\r\nthose who retained their armies, so that glory was not gained by war nor\r\nrepose by peace. Thus when the league and the duke of Milan agreed to\r\nlay aside their arms in 1433, the soldiers, resolved upon war, directed\r\ntheir efforts against the church. There were at this time two factions\r\nor armed parties in Italy, the Sforzesca and the Braccesca. The leader\r\nof the former was the Count Francesco, the son of Sforza, and of the\r\nlatter, Niccolo Piccinino and Niccolo Fortebraccio. Under the banner\r\nof one or other of these parties almost all the forces of Italy were\r\nassembled. Of the two, the Sforzesca was in greatest repute, as well\r\nfrom the bravery of the count himself, as from the promise which the\r\nduke of Milan had made him of his natural daughter, Madonna Bianca, the\r\nprospect of which alliance greatly strengthened his influence. After\r\nthe peace of Lombardy, these forces, from various causes attacked Pope\r\nEugenius. Niccolo Fortebraccio was instigated by the ancient enmity\r\nwhich Braccio had always entertained against the church; the count was\r\ninduced by ambition: so that Niccolo assailed Rome, and the count took\r\npossession of La Marca.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, in order to avoid the war, drove Pope Eugenius from their\r\ncity: and he, having with difficulty escaped, came to Florence, where\r\nseeing the imminent danger of his situation, being abandoned by the\r\nprinces (for they were unwilling again to take up arms in his cause,\r\nafter having been so anxious to lay them aside), he came to terms with\r\nthe count, and ceded to him the sovereignty of La Marca, although, to\r\nthe injury of having occupied it, he had added insult; for in signing\r\nthe place, from which he addressed letters to his agents, he said in\r\nLatin, according to the Latin custom, _Ex Girfalco nostro Firmiano,\r\ninvito Petro et Paulo_. Neither was he satisfied with this concession,\r\nbut insisted upon being appointed Gonfalonier of the church, which was\r\nalso granted; so much more was Eugenius alarmed at the prospect of a\r\ndangerous war than of an ignominious peace. The count, having been\r\nthus been reconciled to the pontiff, attacked Niccolo Fortebraccio, and\r\nduring many months various encounters took place between them, from\r\nall which greater injury resulted to the pope and his subjects, than to\r\neither of the belligerents. At length, by the intervention of the duke\r\nof Milan, an arrangement, by way of a truce, was made, by which both\r\nbecame princes in the territories of the church.\r\n\r\nThe war thus extinguished at Rome was rekindled in Romagna by Batista\r\nda Canneto, who at Bologna slew some of the family of the Grifoni, and\r\nexpelled from the city the governor who resided there for the pope,\r\nalong with others who were opposed to him. To enable himself to retain\r\nthe government, he applied for assistance to Filippo; and the pope,\r\nto avenge himself for the injury, sought the aid of the Venetians and\r\nFlorentines. Both parties obtained assistance, so that very soon two\r\nlarge armies were on foot in Romagna. Niccolo Piccinino commanded for\r\nthe duke, Gattamelata and Niccolo da Tolentino for the Venetians and\r\nFlorentines. They met near Imola, where a battle ensued, in which the\r\nFlorentines and Venetians were routed, and Niccolo da Tolentino was sent\r\nprisoner to Milan where, either through grief for his loss or by some\r\nunfair means, he died in a few days.\r\n\r\nThe duke, on this victory, either being exhausted by the late wars, or\r\nthinking the League after their defeat would not be in haste to resume\r\nhostilities, did not pursue his good fortune, and thus gave the pope and\r\nhis colleagues time to recover themselves. They therefore appointed\r\nthe Count Francesco for their leader, and undertook to drive Niccolo\r\nFortebraccio from the territories of the church, and thus terminate\r\nthe war which had been commenced in favor of the pontiff. The Romans,\r\nfinding the pope supported by so large an army, sought a reconciliation\r\nwith him, and being successful, admitted his commissary into the\r\ncity. Among the places possessed by Niccolo Fortebraccio, were Tivoli,\r\nMontefiascone, Citta di Castello, and Ascesi, to the last of which, not\r\nbeing able to keep the field, he fled, and the count besieged him there.\r\nNiccolo's brave defense making it probable that the war would be of\r\nconsiderable duration, the duke deemed to necessary to prevent the\r\nLeague from obtaining the victory, and said that if this were not\r\neffected he would very soon have to look at the defense of his own\r\nterritories. Resolving to divert the count from the siege, he commanded\r\nNiccolo Piccinino to pass into Tuscany by way of Romagna; and the\r\nLeague, thinking it more important to defend Tuscany than to occupy\r\nAscesi, ordered the count to prevent the passage of Niccolo, who was\r\nalready, with his army, at Furli. The count accordingly moved with his\r\nforces, and came to Cesena, having left the war of La Marca and the care\r\nof his own territories to his brother Lione; and while Niccolo Piccinino\r\nwas endeavoring to pass by, and the count to prevent him, Fortebraccio\r\nattacked Lione with great bravery, made him prisoner, routed his forces,\r\nand pursuing the advantage of his victory, at once possessed himself of\r\nmany places in La Marca. This circumstance greatly perplexed the count,\r\nwho thought he had lost all his territories; so, leaving part of his\r\nforce to check Piccinino, with the remainder he pursued Fortebraccio,\r\nwhom he attacked and conquered. Fortebraccio was taken prisoner in the\r\nbattle, and soon after died of his wounds. This victory restored to the\r\npontiff all the places that had been taken from him by Fortebraccio, and\r\ncompelled the duke of Milan to sue for peace, which was concluded by the\r\nintercession of Niccolo da Esta, marquis of Ferrara; the duke restoring\r\nto the church the places he had taken from her, and his forces retiring\r\ninto Lombardy. Batista da Canneto, as in the case with all who retain\r\nauthority only by the consent and forces of another, when the duke's\r\npeople had quitted Romagna, unable with his own power to keep possession\r\nof Bologna, fled, and Antonio Bentivogli, the head of the opposite\r\nparty, returned to his country.\r\n\r\nAll this took place during the exile of Cosmo, after whose return,\r\nthose who had restored him, and a great number of persons injured by the\r\nopposite party, resolved at all events to make themselves sure of the\r\ngovernment; and the Signory for the months of November and December, not\r\ncontent with what their predecessors had done in favor of their party\r\nextended the term and changed the residences of several who were\r\nbanished, and increased the number of exiles. In addition to these\r\nevils, it was observed that citizens were more annoyed on account of\r\ntheir wealth, their family connections or private animosities, than\r\nfor the sake of the party to which they adhered, so that if these\r\nprescriptions had been accompanied with bloodshed, they would have\r\nresembled those of Octavius and Sylla, though in reality they were not\r\nwithout some stains; for Antonio di Bernardo Guadagni was beheaded, and\r\nfour other citizens, among whom were Zanobi dei Belfratelli and Cosmo\r\nBarbadori, passing the confines to which they were limited, proceeded to\r\nVenice, where the Venetians, valuing the friendship of Cosmo de' Medici\r\nmore than their own honor, sent them prisoners to him, and they were\r\nbasely put to death. This circumstance greatly increased the influence\r\nof that party, and struck their enemies with terror, finding that such\r\na powerful republic would so humble itself to the Florentines. This,\r\nhowever, was supposed to have been done, not so much out of kindness to\r\nCosmo, as to excite dissensions in Florence, and by means of bloodshed\r\nmake greater certainty of division among the citizens, for the Venetians\r\nknew there was no other obstacle to their ambition so great as the union\r\nof her people.\r\n\r\nThe city being cleared of the enemies, or suspected enemies of the\r\nstate, those in possession of the government now began to strengthen\r\ntheir party by conferring benefits upon such as were in a condition\r\nto serve them, and the family of the Alberti, with all who had been\r\nbanished by the former government, were recalled. All the nobility,\r\nwith few exceptions, were reduced to the ranks of the people, and the\r\npossessions of the exiles were divided among themselves, upon each\r\npaying a small acknowledgment. They then fortified themselves with new\r\nlaws and provisos, made new Squittini, withdrawing the names of their\r\nadversaries from the purses, and filling them with those of their\r\nfriends. Taking advice from the ruin of their enemies, they considered\r\nthat to allow the great offices to be filled by mere chance of drawing,\r\ndid not afford the government sufficient security, they therefore\r\nresolved that the magistrates possessing the power of life and death\r\nshould always be chosen from among the leaders of their own party,\r\nand therefore that the _Accoppiatori_, or persons selected for the\r\nimborsation of the new Squittini, with the Signory who had to retire\r\nfrom office, should make the new appointments. They gave to eight of the\r\nguard authority to proceed capitally, and provided that the exiles, when\r\ntheir term of banishment was complete, should not be allowed to return,\r\nunless from the Signory and Colleagues, which were thirty-seven in\r\nnumber, the consent of thirty-four was obtained. It was made unlawful\r\nto write to or to receive letters from them; every word, sign, or action\r\nthat gave offense to the ruling party was punished with the utmost\r\nrigor; and if there was still in Florence any suspected person whom\r\nthese regulations did not reach, he was oppressed with taxes imposed for\r\nthe occasion. Thus in a short time, having expelled or impoverished the\r\nwhole of the adverse party, they established themselves firmly in the\r\ngovernment. Not to be destitute of external assistance, and to deprive\r\nothers of it, who might use it against themselves, they entered into a\r\nleague, offensive and defensive, with the pope, the Venetians, and the\r\nduke of Milan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDeath of Giovanni II.--René of Anjou and Alfonso of Aragon aspire to\r\nthe kingdom--Alfonso is routed and taken by the Genoese--Alfonso being\r\na prisoner of the duke of Milan, obtains his friendship--The Genoese\r\ndisgusted with the duke of Milan--Divisions among the Genoese--The\r\nGenoese, by means of Francesco Spinola, expel the duke's\r\ngovernor--League against the duke of Milan--Rinaldo degli Albizzi\r\nadvises the duke to make war against the Florentines--His discourse to\r\nthe duke--The duke adopts measures injurious to the Florentines--Niccolo\r\nPiccinino appointed to command the duke's forces--Preparations of the\r\nFlorentines--Piccinino routed before Barga.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Florence being in this condition, Giovanna, queen\r\nof Naples, died, and by her will appointed René of Anjou to be her\r\nsuccessor. Alfonso, king of Aragon, was at this time in Sicily, and\r\nhaving obtained the concurrence of many barons, prepared to take\r\npossession of the kingdom. The Neapolitans, with whom a greater number\r\nof barons were also associated, favored René. The pope was unwilling\r\nthat either of them should obtain it; but desired the affairs of Naples\r\nto be administered by a governor of his own appointing.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Alfonso entered the kingdom, and was received by the\r\nduke of Sessa; he brought with him some princes, whom he had engaged in\r\nhis service, with the design (already possessing Capua, which the prince\r\nof Taranto held in his name) of subduing the Neapolitans, and sent his\r\nfleet to attack Gaeta, which had declared itself in their favor. They\r\ntherefore demanded assistance of the duke of Milan, who persuaded the\r\nGenoese to undertake their defense; and they, to satisfy the duke their\r\nsovereign, and protect the merchandise they possessed, both at Naples\r\nand Gaeta, armed a powerful fleet. Alfonso hearing of this, augmented\r\nhis own naval force, went in person to meet the Genoese, and coming up\r\nwith them near the island of Ponzio, an engagement ensued, in which the\r\nAragonese were defeated, and Alfonso, with many of the princes of his\r\nsuite, made prisoners, and sent by the Genoese to the Filippo.\r\n\r\nThis victory terrified the princes of Italy, who, being jealous of the\r\nduke's power, thought it would give him a great opportunity of being\r\nsovereign of the whole country. But so contrary are the views of men,\r\nthat he took a directly opposite course. Alfonso was a man of\r\ngreat sagacity, and as soon as an opportunity presented itself\r\nof communicating with Filippo, he proved to him how completely he\r\ncontravened his own interests, by favoring René and opposing himself;\r\nfor it would be the business of the former, on becoming king of Naples,\r\nto introduce the French into Milan; that in an emergency he might have\r\nassistance at hand, without the necessity of having to solicit a passage\r\nfor his friends. But he could not possibly secure this advantage without\r\neffecting the ruin of the duke, and making his dominions a French\r\nprovince; and that the contrary of all this would result from himself\r\nbecoming lord of Naples; for having only the French to fear, he would be\r\ncompelled to love and caress, nay even to obey those who had it in their\r\npower to open a passage for his enemies. That thus the title of king\r\nof king of Naples would be with himself (Alfonso), but the power and\r\nauthority with Filippo; so that it was much more the duke's business\r\nthan his own to consider the danger of one course and the advantage of\r\nthe other; unless he rather wished to gratify his private prejudices\r\nthan to give security to his dominions. In the one case he would be a\r\nfree prince, in the other, placed between two powerful sovereigns, he\r\nwould either be robbed of his territories or live in constant fear, and\r\nhave to obey them like a slave. These arguments so greatly influenced\r\nthe duke, that, changing his design, he set Alfonso at liberty, sent\r\nhim honorably to Genoa and then to Naples. From thence the king went\r\nto Gaeta, which as soon as his liberation had become known, was taken\r\npossession of by some nobles of his party.\r\n\r\nThe Genoese, seeing that the duke, without the least regard for them,\r\nhad liberated the king, and gained credit to himself through the dangers\r\nand expense which they had incurred; that he enjoyed all the honor of\r\nthe liberation, and they were themselves exposed to the odium of the\r\ncapture, and the injuries consequent upon the king's defeat, were\r\ngreatly exasperated. In the city of Genoa, while in the enjoyment of her\r\nliberty, a magistrate is created with the consent of the people, whom\r\nthey call the Doge; not that he is absolutely a prince, or that he alone\r\nhas the power of determining matters of government; but that, as the\r\nhead of the state, he proposes those questions or subjects which have\r\nto be considered and determined by the magistrates and the councils. In\r\nthat city are many noble families so powerful, that they are with great\r\ndifficulty induced to submit to the authority of the law. Of these,\r\nthe most powerful are the Fregosa and the Adorna, from whom arise the\r\ndissensions of the city, and the impotence of her civil regulations; for\r\nthe possession of this high office being contested by means inadmissible\r\nin well-regulated communities, and most commonly with arms in their\r\nhands, it always occurs that one party is oppressed and the other\r\ntriumphant; and sometimes those who fail in the pursuit have recourse to\r\nthe arms of strangers, and the country they are not allowed to rule they\r\nsubject to foreign authority. Hence it happens, that those who govern in\r\nLombardy most commonly command in Genoa, as occurred at the time Alfonso\r\nof Aragon was made prisoner. Among the leading Genoese who had been\r\ninstrumental in subjecting the republic to Filippo, was Francesco\r\nSpinola, who, soon after he had reduced his country to bondage, as\r\nalways happens in such cases, became suspected by the duke. Indignant at\r\nthis, he withdrew to a sort of voluntary exile at Gaeta, and being\r\nthere when the naval expedition was in preparation, and having conducted\r\nhimself with great bravery in the action, he thought he had again\r\nmerited so much of the duke's confidence as would obtain for him\r\npermission to remain undisturbed at Genoa. But the duke still retained\r\nhis suspicions; for he could not believe that a vacillating defender of\r\nhis own country's liberty would be faithful to himself; and Francesco\r\nSpinola resolved again to try his fortune, and if possible restore\r\nfreedom to his country, and honorable safety for himself; for he was\r\nthere was no probability of regaining the forfeited affection of\r\nhis fellow-citizens, but by resolving at his own peril to remedy the\r\nmisfortunes which he had been so instrumental in producing. Finding the\r\nindignation against the duke universal, on account of the liberation\r\nof the king, he thought the moment propitious for the execution of his\r\ndesign. He communicated his ideas to some whom he knew to be similarly\r\ninclined, and his arguments ensured their co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe great festival of St. John the Baptist being come, when Arismeno,\r\nthe new governor sent by the duke, was to enter Genoa, and he being\r\nalready arrived, accompanied by Opicino, the former governor, and many\r\nGenoese citizens, Francesco Spinola thought further delay improper; and,\r\nissuing from his house with those acquainted with his design, all armed,\r\nthey raised the cry of liberty. It was wonderful to see how eagerly the\r\ncitizens and people assembled at the word; so that those who for any\r\nreason might be favorable to Filippo, not only had no time to arm, but\r\nscarcely to consider the means of escape. Arismeno, with some Genoese,\r\nfled to the fortress which was held for the duke, Opicino, thinking that\r\nif he could reach the palace, where two thousand men were in arms, and\r\nat his command, he might be able either to effect his own safety, or\r\ninduce his friends to defend themselves, took that direction; but before\r\nhe arrived at the piazza he was slain, his body divided into many pieces\r\nand scattered about the city. The Genoese having placed the government\r\nin the hands of free magistrates, in a few days recovered the castle,\r\nand the other strongholds possessed by the duke, and delivered\r\nthemselves entirely from his yoke.\r\n\r\nThese transactions, though at first they had alarmed the princes of\r\nItaly with the apprehension that the duke would become too powerful,\r\nnow gave them hope, seeing the turn they had taken, of being able to\r\nrestrain him; and, notwithstanding the recent league, the Florentines\r\nand Venetians entered into alliance with the Genoese. Rinaldo degli\r\nAlbizzi and the other leading Florentine exiles, observing the altered\r\naspect of affairs, conceived hopes of being able to induce the duke\r\nto make war against Florence, and having arrived at Milan, Rinaldo\r\naddressed him in the following manner: \"If we, who were once your\r\nenemies, come now confidently to supplicate your assistance to enable\r\nus to return to our country, neither you, nor anyone, who considers the\r\ncourse and vicissitudes of human affairs, can be at all surprised; for\r\nof our past conduct toward yourself and our present intentions toward\r\nour country, we can adduce palpable and abundant reasons. No good man\r\nwill ever reproach another who endeavors to defend his country, whatever\r\nbe his mode of doing so; neither have we had any design of injuring\r\nyou, but only to preserve our country from detriment; and we appeal to\r\nyourself, whether, during the greatest victories of our league, when you\r\nwere really desirous of peace, we were not even more anxious for it than\r\nyourself; so that we do not think we have done aught to make us despair\r\naltogether of favor from you. Nor can our country itself complain that\r\nwe now exhort you to use those arms against her, from which we have so\r\npertinaciously defended her; for that state alone merits the love of\r\nall her citizens, which cares with equal affection for all; not one that\r\nfavors a few, and casts from her the great mass of her children. Nor are\r\nthe arms that men use against their country to be universally condemned;\r\nfor communities, although composed of many, resemble individual bodies;\r\nand as in these, many infirmities arise which cannot be cured without\r\nthe application of fire or of steel, so in the former, there often occur\r\nsuch numerous and great evils, that a good and merciful citizen, when\r\nthere is a necessity for the sword, would be much more to blame in\r\nleaving her uncured, than by using this remedy for her preservation.\r\nWhat greater disease can afflict a republic than slavery? and what\r\nremedy is more desirable for adoption than the one by which alone it can\r\nbe effectually removed? No wars are just but those that are necessary;\r\nand force is merciful when it presents the only hope of relief. I know\r\nnot what necessity can be greater than ours, or what compassion can\r\nexceed that which rescues our country from slavery. Our cause is\r\ntherefore just, and our purpose merciful, as both yourself and we may\r\nbe easily convinced. The amplest justice is on your side; for the\r\nFlorentines have not hesitated, after a peace concluded with so much\r\nsolemnity, to enter into league with those who have rebelled against\r\nyou; so that if our cause is insufficient to excite you against them,\r\nlet your own just indignation do so; and the more so, seeing the\r\nfacility of the undertaking. You need be under no apprehension from the\r\nmemory of the past, in which you may have observed the power of\r\nthat people and their pertinency in self-defense; though these might\r\nreasonably excite fear, if they were still animated by the valor of\r\nformer times. But now, all is entirely the reverse; for what power can\r\nbe expected in a city that has recently expelled the greatest part of\r\nher wealth and industry? What indomitable resolution need be apprehended\r\nfrom the people whom so many and such recent enmities have disunited?\r\nThe disunion which still prevails will prevent wealthy citizens\r\nadvancing money as they used to do on former occasions; for though men\r\nwillingly contribute according to their means, when they see their own\r\ncredit, glory, and private advantage dependent upon it, or when there\r\nis a hope of regaining in peace what has been spent in war, but not when\r\nequally oppressed under all circumstances, when in war they suffer the\r\ninjuries of the enemy, and in peace, the insolence of those who govern\r\nthem. Besides this, the people feel more deeply the avarice of their\r\nrulers, than the rapacity of the enemy; for there is hope of being\r\nultimately relieved from the latter evil, but none from the former.\r\nThus, in the last war, you had to contend with the whole city; but now\r\nwith only a small portion. You attempted to take the government from\r\nmany good citizens; but now you oppose only a few bad ones. You then\r\nendeavored to deprive a city of her liberty, now you come to restore\r\nit. As it is unreasonable to suppose that under such disparity of\r\ncircumstances, the result should be the same, you have now every reason\r\nto anticipate an easy victory; and how much it will strengthen your own\r\ngovernment, you may easily judge; having Tuscany friendly, and bound by\r\nso powerful an obligation, in your enterprises, she will be even of more\r\nservice to you than Milan. And, although, on former occasions, such an\r\nacquisition might be looked upon as ambitious and unwarrantable, it will\r\nnow be considered merciful and just. Then do not let this opportunity\r\nescape, and be assured, that although your attempts against the city\r\nhave been attended with difficulty, expense, and disgrace, this will\r\nwith facility procure you incalculable advantage and an honorable\r\nrenown.\"\r\n\r\nMany words were not requisite to induce the duke to hostilities against\r\nthe Florentines, for he was incited to it by hereditary hatred and blind\r\nambition, and still more, by the fresh injuries which the league with\r\nthe Genoese involved; yet his past expenses, the dangerous measures\r\nnecessary, the remembrance of his recent losses, and the vain hopes of\r\nthe exiles, alarmed him. As soon as he had learned the revolt of Genoa,\r\nhe ordered Niccolo Piccinino to proceed thither with all his cavalry\r\nand whatever infantry he could raise, for the purpose of recovering\r\nher, before the citizens had time to become settled and establish a\r\ngovernment; for he trusted greatly in the fortress within the city,\r\nwhich was held for him. And although Niccolo drove the Genoese from\r\nthe mountains, took from them the valley of Pozeveri, where they had\r\nentrenched themselves, and obliged them to seek refuge within the walls\r\nof the city, he still found such an insurmountable obstacle in the\r\nresolute defense of the citizens, that he was compelled to withdraw. On\r\nthis, at the suggestion of the Florentine exiles, he commanded Niccolo\r\nto attack them on the eastern side, upon the confines of Pisa in the\r\nGenoese territory, and to push the war with his utmost vigor, thinking\r\nthis plan would manifest and develop the course best to be adopted.\r\nNiccolo therefore besieged and took Serezana, and having committed great\r\nravages, by way of further alarming the Florentines he proceeded to\r\nLucca, spreading a report that it was his intention to go to Naples\r\nto render assistance to the king of Aragon. Upon these new events Pope\r\nEugenius left Florence and proceeded to Bologna, where he endeavored\r\nto effect an amicable arrangement between the league and the duke,\r\nintimating to the latter, that if he would not consent to some treaty,\r\nthe pontiff must send Francesco Sforza to assist the league, for the\r\nlatter was now his confederate, and served in his pay. Although the pope\r\ngreatly exerted himself in this affair, his endeavors were unavailing;\r\nfor the duke would not listen to any proposal that did not leave him the\r\npossession of Genoa, and the league had resolved that she should remain\r\nfree; and, therefore, each party, having no other resource, prepared to\r\ncontinue the war.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Niccolo Piccinino arrived at Lucca, and the Florentines,\r\nbeing doubtful what course to adopt, ordered Neri di Gino to lead their\r\nforces into the Pisan territory, induced the pontiff to allow Count\r\nFrancesco to join him, and with their forces they halted at San Gonda.\r\nPiccinino then demanded admission into the kingdom of Naples, and this\r\nbeing refused, he threatened to force a passage. The armies were\r\nequal, both in regard of numbers and the capacity of their leaders, and\r\nunwilling to tempt fortune during the bad weather, it being the month of\r\nDecember, they remained several days without attacking each other. The\r\nfirst movement was made by Niccolo Piccinino, who being informed that if\r\nhe attacked Vico Pisano by night, he could easily take possession of\r\nthe place, made the attempt, and having failed, ravaged the surrounding\r\ncountry, and then burned and plundered the town of San Giovanni alla\r\nVena. This enterprise, though of little consequence, excited him to make\r\nfurther attempts, the more so from being assured that the count and Neri\r\nwere yet in their quarters, and he attacked Santa Maria in Castello and\r\nFiletto, both which places he took. Still the Florentine forces would\r\nnot stir; not that the count entertained any fear, but because, out of\r\nregard to the pope, who still labored to effect an accommodation, the\r\ngovernment of Florence had deferred giving their final consent to the\r\nwar. This course, which the Florentines adopted from prudence, was\r\nconsidered by the enemy to be only the result of timidity, and with\r\nincreased boldness they led their forces up to Barga, which they\r\nresolved to besiege. This new attack made the Florentines set aside\r\nall other considerations, and resolve not only to relieve Barga, but\r\nto invade the Lucchese territory. Accordingly the count proceeded in\r\npursuit of Niccolo, and coming up with him before Barga, an engagement\r\ntook place, in which Piccinino was overcome, and compelled to raise the\r\nsiege.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians considering the duke to have broken the peace, send Giovan\r\nFrancesco da Gonzaga, their captain, to Ghiaradadda, who, by severely\r\nwasting the duke's territories, induced him to recall Niccolo Piccinino\r\nfrom Tuscany. This circumstance, together with the victory obtained over\r\nNiccolo, emboldened the Florentines to attempt the recovery of Lucca,\r\nsince the duke, whom alone they feared, was engaged with the Venetians,\r\nand the Lucchese having received the enemy into their city, and allowed\r\nhim to attack them, would have no ground of complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Florentines go to war with Lucca--Discourse of a citizen of Lucca to\r\nanimate the plebeians against the Florentines--The Lucchese resolve\r\nto defend themselves--They are assisted by the duke of Milan--Treaty\r\nbetween the Florentines and the Venetians--Francesco Sforza, captain of\r\nthe league, refuses to cross the Po in the service of the Venetians\r\nand returns to Tuscany--The bad faith of the Venetians toward the\r\nFlorentines--Cosmo de' Medici at Venice--Peace between the Florentines\r\nand the Lucchese--The Florentines effect a reconciliation between the\r\npope and the Count di Poppi--The pope consecrates the church of Santa\r\nReparata--Council of Florence.\r\n\r\nThe count commenced operations against Lucca in April, 1437, and the\r\nFlorentines, desirous of recovering what they had themselves lost before\r\nthey attacked others, retook Santa Maria in Castello, and all the places\r\nwhich Piccinino had occupied. Then, entering the Lucchese territory,\r\nthey besieged Camaiore, the inhabitants of which, although faithful\r\nto their rulers, being influenced more by immediate danger than by\r\nattachment to their distant friends, surrendered. In the same manner,\r\nthey obtained Massa and Serezana. Toward the end of May they proceeded\r\nin the direction of Lucca, burning the towns, destroying the growing\r\ncrops, grain, trees, and vines, driving away the cattle, and leaving\r\nnothing undone to injure the enemy. The Lucchese, finding themselves\r\nabandoned by the duke, and hopeless of defending the open country,\r\nforsook it; entrenched and fortified the city, which they doubted not,\r\nbeing well garrisoned, they would be able to defend for a time, and\r\nthat, in the interim, some event would occur for their relief, as had\r\nbeen the case during the former wars which the Florentines had carried\r\non against them. Their only apprehension arose from the fickle minds\r\nof the plebeians, who, becoming weary of the siege, would have more\r\nconsideration of their own danger than of other's liberty, and would\r\nthus compel them to submit to some disgraceful and ruinous capitulation.\r\nIn order to animate them to defense, they were assembled in the public\r\npiazza, and some of the eldest and most esteemed of the citizens\r\naddressed them in the following terms: \"You are doubtless aware that\r\nwhat is done from necessity involves neither censure nor applause;\r\ntherefore, if you should accuse us of having caused the present war, by\r\nreceiving the ducal forces into the city, and allowing them to commit\r\nhostilities against the Florentines, you are greatly mistaken. You are\r\nwell acquainted with the ancient enmity of the Florentines against you,\r\nwhich is not occasioned by any injuries you have done them, or by fear\r\non their part, but by our weakness and their own ambition; for the one\r\ngives them hope of being able to oppress us, and the other incites them\r\nto attempt it. It is then vain to imagine that any merit of yours can\r\nextinguish that desire in them, or that any offense you can commit, can\r\nprovoke them to greater animosity. They endeavor to deprive you of your\r\nliberty; you must resolve to defend it; and whatever they may undertake\r\nagainst us for that purpose, although we may lament, we need not wonder.\r\nWe may well grieve, therefore, that they attack us, take possession of\r\nour towns, burn our houses, and waste our country. But who is so simple\r\nas to be surprised at it? for were it in our power, we should do just\r\nthe same to them, or even worse. They declare war against us now, they\r\nsay, for having received Niccolo; but if we had not received him, they\r\nwould have done the same and assigned some other ground for it; and if\r\nthe evil had been delayed, it would most probably have been greater.\r\nTherefore, you must not imagine it to be occasioned by his arrival, but\r\nrather by your own ill fortune and their ambition; for we could not have\r\nrefused admission to the duke's forces, and, being come, we could\r\nnot prevent their aggressions. You know, that without the aid of some\r\npowerful ally we are incapable of self-defense, and that none can render\r\nus this service more powerfully or faithfully than the duke. He restored\r\nour liberty; it is reasonable to expect he will defend it. He has always\r\nbeen the greatest foe of our inveterate enemies; if, therefore, to avoid\r\nincensing the Florentines we had excited his anger, we should have lost\r\nour best friend, and rendered our enemy more powerful and more disposed\r\nto oppress us; so that it is far preferable to have this war upon our\r\nhands, and enjoy the favor of the duke, than to be in peace without it.\r\nBesides, we are justified in expecting that he will rescue us from the\r\ndangers into which we are brought on his account, if we only do not\r\nabandon our own cause. You all know how fiercely the Florentines have\r\nfrequently assailed us, and with what glory we have maintained our\r\ndefense. We have often been deprived of every hope, except in God\r\nand the casualties which time might produce, and both have proved our\r\nfriends. And as they have delivered us formerly, why should they not\r\ncontinue to do so. Then we were forsaken by the whole of Italy; now we\r\nhave the duke in our favor; besides we have a right to suppose that the\r\nVenetians will not hastily attack us; for they will not willingly see\r\nthe power of Florence increased. On a former occasion the Florentines\r\nwere more at liberty; they had greater hope of assistance, and were more\r\npowerful in themselves, while we were in every respect weaker; for then\r\na tyrant governed us, now we defend ourselves; then the glory of our\r\ndefense was another's, now it is our own; then they were in harmony, now\r\nthey are disunited, all Italy being filled with their banished citizens.\r\nBut were we without the hope which these favorable circumstances\r\npresent, our extreme necessity should make us firmly resolved on our\r\ndefense. It is reasonable to fear every enemy, for all seek their\r\nown glory and your ruin; above all others, you have to dread the\r\nFlorentines, for they would not be satisfied by submission and tribute,\r\nor the dominion of our city, but they would possess our entire substance\r\nand persons, that they might satiate their cruelty with our blood, and\r\ntheir avarice with our property, so that all ranks ought to dread them.\r\nTherefore do not be troubled at seeing our crops destroyed, our towns\r\nburned, our fortresses occupied; for if we preserve the city, the rest\r\nwill be saved as a matter of course; if we lose her, all else would be\r\nof no advantage to us; for while retaining our liberty, the enemy can\r\nhold them only with the greatest difficulty, while losing it they would\r\nbe preserved in vain. Arm, therefore; and when in the fight, remember\r\nthat the reward of victory will be safety, not only to your country, but\r\nto your homes, your wives, and your children.\" The speaker's last words\r\nwere received with the utmost enthusiasm by the people, who promised one\r\nand all to die rather than abandon their cause, or submit to any terms\r\nthat could violate their liberty. They then made arrangements for the\r\ndefense of the city.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Florentine forces were not idle; and after\r\ninnumerable mischiefs done to the country took Monte Carlo by\r\ncapitulation. They then besieged Uzzano, in order that the Lucchese,\r\nbeing pressed on all sides, might despair of assistance, and be\r\ncompelled to submission by famine. The fortress was very strong, and\r\ndefended by a numerous garrison, so that its capture would be by no\r\nmeans an easy undertaking. The Lucchese, as might be expected, seeing\r\nthe imminent peril of their situation, had recourse to the duke, and\r\nemployed prayers and remonstrances to induce him to render them aid.\r\nThey enlarged upon their own merits and the offenses of the Florentines;\r\nand showed how greatly it would attach the duke's friends to him to\r\nfind they were defended, and how much disaffection it would spread among\r\nthem, if they were left to be overwhelmed by the enemy; that if they\r\nlost their liberties and their lives, he would lose his honor and his\r\nfriends, and forfeit the confidence of all who from affection might be\r\ninduced to incur dangers in his behalf; and added tears to entreaties,\r\nso that if he were unmoved by gratitude to them, he might be induced\r\nto their defense by motives of compassion. The duke, influenced by his\r\ninveterate hostility against the Florentines, his new obligation to\r\nthe Lucchese, and, above all, by his desire to prevent so great\r\nan acquisition from falling into the hands of his ancient enemies,\r\ndetermined either to send a strong force into Tuscany, or vigorously to\r\nassail the Venetians, so as to compel the Florentines to give up their\r\nenterprise and go to their relief.\r\n\r\nIt was soon known in Florence that the duke was preparing to send forces\r\ninto Tuscany. This made the Florentines apprehensive for the success\r\nof their enterprise; and in order to retain the duke in Lombardy, they\r\nrequested the Venetians to press him with their utmost strength. But\r\nthey also were alarmed, the marquis of Mantua having abandoned them and\r\ngone over to the duke; and thus, finding themselves almost defenseless,\r\nthey replied, \"that instead of increasing their responsibilities, they\r\nshould be unable to perform their part in the war, unless the Count\r\nFrancesco were sent to them to take the command of the army, and with\r\nthe special understanding that he should engage to cross the Po in\r\nperson. They declined to fulfil their former engagements unless he were\r\nbound to do so; for they could not carry on the war without a leader,\r\nor repose confidence in any except the count; and he himself would be\r\nuseless to them, unless he came under an obligation to carry on the\r\nwar whenever they might think needful.\" The Florentines thought the war\r\nought to be pushed vigorously in Lombardy; but they saw that if they\r\nlost the count their enterprise against Lucca was ruined; and they knew\r\nwell that the demand of the Venetians arose less from any need they had\r\nof the count, than from their desire to frustrate this expedition. The\r\ncount, on the other hand, was ready to pass into Lombardy whenever\r\nthe league might require him, but would not alter the tenor of his\r\nengagement; for he was unwilling to sacrifice the hope of the alliance\r\npromised to him by the duke.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines were thus embarrassed by two contrary impulses, the\r\nwish to possess Lucca, and the dread of a war with Milan. As commonly\r\nhappens, fear was the most powerful, and they consented, after the\r\ncapture of Uzzano, that the count should go into Lombardy. There still\r\nremained another difficulty, which, depending on circumstances beyond\r\nthe reach of their influence, created more doubts and uneasiness\r\nthan the former; the count would not consent to pass the Po, and the\r\nVenetians refused to accept him on any other condition. Seeing no other\r\nmethod of arrangement, than that each should make liberal concessions,\r\nthe Florentines induced the count to cross the river by a letter\r\naddressed to the Signory of Florence, intimating that this private\r\npromise did not invalidate any public engagement, and that he might\r\nstill refrain from crossing; hence it resulted that the Venetians,\r\nhaving commenced the war, would be compelled to proceed, and that the\r\nevil apprehended by the Florentines would be averted. To the\r\nVenetians, on the other hand, they averred that this private letter was\r\nsufficiently binding, and therefore they ought to be content; for if\r\nthey could save the count from breaking with his father-in-law, it was\r\nwell to do so, and that it could be of no advantage either to themselves\r\nor the Venetians to publish it without some manifest necessity. It was\r\nthus determined that the count should pass into Lombardy; and having\r\ntaken Uzzano, and raised bastions about Lucca to restrain in her\r\ninhabitants, placed the management of the siege in the hands of the\r\ncommissaries, crossed the Apennines, and proceeded to Reggio, when\r\nthe Venetians, alarmed at his progress, and in order to discover his\r\nintentions, insisted upon his immediately crossing the Po, and joining\r\nthe other forces. The count refused compliance, and many mutual\r\nrecriminations took place between him and Andrea Mauroceno, their\r\nmessenger on this occasion, each charging the other with arrogance\r\nand treachery: after many protestations, the one of being under no\r\nobligation to perform that service, and the other of not being bound to\r\nany payment, they parted, the count to return to Tuscany, the other to\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines had sent the count to encamp in the Pisan territory, and\r\nwere in hopes of inducing him to renew the war against the Lucchese, but\r\nfound him indisposed to do so, for the duke, having been informed that\r\nout of regard to him he had refused to cross the Po, thought that by\r\nthis means he might also save the Lucchese, and begged the count to\r\nendeavor to effect an accommodation between the Florentines and the\r\nLucchese, including himself in it, if he were able, declaring, at\r\nthe same time, the promised marriage should be solemnized whenever he\r\nthought proper. The prospect of this connection had great influence with\r\nthe count, for, as the duke had no sons, it gave him hope of becoming\r\nsovereign of Milan. For this reason he gradually abated his exertions\r\nin the war, declared he would not proceed unless the Venetians fulfilled\r\ntheir engagement as to the payment, and also retained him in the\r\ncommand; that the discharge of the debt would not alone be sufficient,\r\nfor desiring to live peaceably in his own dominions, he needed some\r\nalliance other than that of the Florentines, and that he must regard his\r\nown interests, shrewdly hinting that if abandoned by the Venetians, he\r\nwould come to terms with the duke.\r\n\r\nThese indirect and crafty methods of procedure were highly offensive\r\nto the Florentines, for they found their expedition against Lucca\r\nfrustrated, and trembled for the safety of their own territories if ever\r\nthe count and the duke should enter into a mutual alliance. To induce\r\nthe Venetians to retain the count in the command, Cosmo de' Medici went\r\nto Venice, hoping his influence would prevail with them, and discussed\r\nthe subject at great length before the senate, pointing out the\r\ncondition of the Italian states, the disposition of their armies, and\r\nthe great preponderance possessed by the duke. He concluded by saying,\r\nthat if the count and the duke were to unite their forces, they (the\r\nVenetians) might return to the sea, and the Florentines would have to\r\nfight for their liberty. To this the Venetians replied, that they were\r\nacquainted with their own strength and that of the Italians, and thought\r\nthemselves able at all events to provide for their own defense; that\r\nit was not their custom to pay soldiers for serving others; that as the\r\nFlorentines had used the count's services, they must pay him themselves;\r\nwith respect to the security of their own states, it was rather\r\ndesirable to check the count's pride than to pay him, for the ambition\r\nof men is boundless, and if he were now paid without serving, he would\r\nsoon make some other demand, still more unreasonable and dangerous. It\r\ntherefore seemed necessary to curb his insolence, and not allow it to\r\nincrease till it became incorrigible; and that if the Florentines, from\r\nfear or any other motive, wished to preserve his friendship, they must\r\npay him themselves. Cosmo returned without having effected any part of\r\nhis object.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines used the weightiest arguments they could adopt to\r\nprevent the count from quitting the service of the League, a course he\r\nwas himself reluctant to follow, but his desire to conclude the marriage\r\nso embarrassed him, that any trivial accident would have been sufficient\r\nto determine his course, as indeed shortly happened. The count had\r\nleft his territories in La Marca to the care of Il Furlano, one of his\r\nprincipal condottieri, who was so far influenced by the duke as to\r\ntake command under him, and quit the count's service. This circumstance\r\ncaused the latter to lay aside every idea but that of his own safety,\r\nand to come to agreement with the duke; among the terms of which compact\r\nwas one that he should not be expected to interfere in the affairs of\r\nRomagna and Tuscany. The count then urged the Florentines to come to\r\nterms with the Lucchese, and so convinced them of the necessity of this,\r\nthat seeing no better course to adopt, they complied in April, 1438, by\r\nwhich treaty the Lucchese retained their liberty, and the Florentines\r\nMonte Carlo and a few other fortresses. After this, being full\r\nof exasperation, they despatched letters to every part of Italy,\r\novercharged with complaints, affecting to show that since God and men\r\nwere averse to the Lucchese coming under their dominion, they had made\r\npeace with them. And it seldom happens that any suffer so much for the\r\nloss of their own lawful property as they did because they could not\r\nobtain the possessions of others.\r\n\r\nThough the Florentines had now so many affairs in hand, they did not\r\nallow the proceedings of their neighbors to pass unnoticed, or neglect\r\nthe decoration of their city. As before observed, Niccolo Fortebraccio\r\nwas dead. He had married a daughter of the Count di Poppi, who, at\r\nthe decease of his son-in-law, held the Borgo San Sepolcro, and other\r\nfortresses of that district, and while Niccolo lived, governed them in\r\nhis name. Claiming them as his daughter's portion, he refused to give\r\nthem up to the pope, who demanded them as property held of the church,\r\nand who, upon his refusal, sent the patriarch with forces to take\r\npossession of them. The count, finding himself unable to sustain the\r\nattack, offered them to the Florentines, who declined them; but the pope\r\nhaving returned to Florence, they interceded with him in the count's\r\nbehalf. Difficulties arising, the patriarch attacked the Casentino, took\r\nPrato Vecchio, and Romena, and offered them also to the Florentines, who\r\nrefused them likewise, unless the pope would consent they should restore\r\nthem to the count, to which, after much hesitation, he acceded, on\r\ncondition that the Florentines should prevail with the Count di Poppi\r\nto restore the Borgo to him. The pope was thus satisfied, and the\r\nFlorentines having so far completed the building of their cathedral\r\nchurch of Santa Reparata, which had been commenced long ago, as to\r\nenable them to perform divine service in it, requested his holiness\r\nto consecrate it. To this the pontiff willingly agreed, and the\r\nFlorentines, to exhibit the wealth of the city and the splendor of the\r\nedifice, and do greater honor to the pope, erected a platform from\r\nSanta Maria Novella, where he resided, to the cathedral he was about to\r\nconsecrate, six feet in height and twelve feet wide, covered with rich\r\ndrapery, for the accommodation of the pontiff and his court, upon which\r\nthey proceeded to the building, accompanied by those civic magistrates,\r\nand other officers who were appointed to take part in the procession.\r\nThe usual ceremonies of consecration having been completed, the pope, to\r\nshow his affection for the city, conferred the honor of knighthood upon\r\nGiuliano Davanzati, their Gonfalonier of Justice, and a citizen of the\r\nhighest reputation; and the Signory, not to appear less gracious than\r\nthe pope, granted to the new created knight the government of Pisa for\r\none year.\r\n\r\nThere were at that time certain differences between the Roman and the\r\nGreek churches, which prevented perfect conformity in divine service;\r\nand at the last council of Bâle, the prelates of the Western church\r\nhaving spoken at great length upon the subject, it was resolved that\r\nefforts should be made to bring the emperor and the Greek prelates to\r\nthe council at Bâle, to endeavor to reconcile the Greek church with the\r\nRoman. Though this resolution was derogatory to the majesty of the Greek\r\nempire, and offensive to its clergy, yet being then oppressed by the\r\nTurks, and fearing their inability for defense, in order to have a\r\nbetter ground for requesting assistance, they submitted; and therefore,\r\nthe emperor, the patriarch, with other prelates and barons of Greece,\r\nto comply with the resolution of the council, assembled at Bâle, came\r\nto Venice; but being terrified by the plague then prevailing, it was\r\nresolved to terminate their differences at Florence. The Roman and Greek\r\nprelates having held a conference during several days, in which many\r\nlong discussions took place, the Greeks yielded, and agreed to adopt the\r\nritual of the church of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nNew wars in Italy--Niccolo Piccinino, in concert with the duke of\r\nMilan, deceives the pope, and takes many places from the church--Niccolo\r\nattacks the Venetians--Fears and precautions of the Florentines--The\r\nVenetians request assistance of the Florentines and of Sforza--League\r\nagainst the duke of Milan--The Florentines resolve to send the count to\r\nassist the Venetians--Neri di Gino Capponi at Venice--His discourse to\r\nthe senate--Extreme joy of the Venetians.\r\n\r\nPeace being restored between the Lucchese and Florentines, and the duke\r\nand the count having become friends, hopes were entertained that the\r\narms of Italy would be laid aside, although those in the kingdom of\r\nNaples, between René of Anjou and Alfonso of Aragon, could find repose\r\nonly by the ruin of one party or the other. And though the pope was\r\ndissatisfied with the loss of so large a portion of his territories,\r\nand the ambition of the duke and the Venetians was obvious, still it was\r\nthought that the pontiff, from necessity, and the others from weariness,\r\nwould be advocates of peace. However, a different state of feeling\r\nprevailed, for neither the duke nor the Venetians were satisfied with\r\ntheir condition; so that hostilities were resumed, and Lombardy and\r\nTuscany were again harassed by the horrors of war. The proud mind of\r\nthe duke could not endure that the Venetians should possess Bergamo and\r\nBrescia, and he was still further annoyed, by hearing, that they were\r\nconstantly in arms, and in the daily practice of annoying some portion\r\nof his territories. He thought, however, that he should not only be able\r\nto restrain them, but to recover the places he had lost, if the pope,\r\nthe Florentines, and the count could be induced to forego the Venetian\r\nalliance. He therefore resolved to take Romagna from the pontiff,\r\nimagining that his holiness could not injure him, and that the\r\nFlorentines, finding the conflagration so near, either for their own\r\nsake would refrain from interference, or if they did not, could not\r\nconveniently attack him. The duke was also aware of the resentment\r\nof the Florentines against the Venetians, on account of the affair of\r\nLucca, and he therefore judged they would be the less eager to take\r\narms against him on their behalf. With regard to the Count Francesco,\r\nhe trusted that their new friendship, and the hope of his alliance would\r\nkeep him quiet. To give as little color as possible for complaint, and\r\nto lull suspicion, particularly, because in consequence of his treaty\r\nwith the count, the latter could not attack Romagna, he ordered Niccolo\r\nPiccinino, as if instigated by his own ambition to do so.\r\n\r\nWhen the agreement between the duke and the count was concluded, Niccolo\r\nwas in Romagna, and in pursuance of his instructions from the duke,\r\naffected to be highly incensed, that a connection had been established\r\nbetween him and the count, his inveterate enemy. He therefore withdrew\r\nhimself and his forces to Camurata, a place between Furli and Ravenna,\r\nwhich he fortified, as if designing to remain there some time, or till a\r\nnew enterprise should present itself. The report of his resentment being\r\ndiffused, Niccolo gave the pope to understand how much the duke was\r\nunder obligation to him, and how ungrateful he proved; and he was\r\npersuaded that, possessing nearly all the arms of Italy, under the\r\ntwo principal generals, he could render himself sole ruler: but if\r\nhis holiness pleased, of the two principal generals whom he fancied\r\nhe possessed, one would become his enemy, and the other be rendered\r\nuseless; for, if money were provided him, and he were kept in pay, he\r\nwould attack the territories held of the church by the count, who being\r\ncompelled to look to his own interests, could not subserve the ambition\r\nof Filippo. The pope giving entire credence to this representation,\r\non account of its apparent reasonableness, sent Niccolo five thousand\r\nducats and loaded him with promises of states for himself and his\r\nchildren. And though many informed him of the deception, he could not\r\ngive credit to them, nor would he endure the conversation of any who\r\nseemed to doubt the integrity of Niccolo's professions. The city of\r\nRavenna was held for the church by Ostasio da Polenta. Niccolo finding\r\nfurther delay would be detrimental, since his son Francesco had, to the\r\npope's great dishonor, pillaged Spoleto, determined to attack Ravenna,\r\neither because he judged the enterprise easy, or because he had a secret\r\nunderstanding with Ostasio, for in a few days after the attack, the\r\nplace capitulated. He then took Bologna, Imola, and Furli; and (what\r\nis worthy of remark) of twenty fortresses held in that country for the\r\npope, not one escaped falling into his hands. Not satisfied with these\r\ninjuries inflicted on the pontiff, he resolved to banter him by his\r\nwords as well as ridicule him by his deeds, and wrote, that he had only\r\ndone as his holiness deserved, for having unblushingly attempted to\r\ndivide two such attached friends as the duke and himself, and for having\r\ndispersed over Italy letters intimating that he had quitted the duke\r\nto take part with the Venetians. Having taken possession of Romagna,\r\nNiccolo left it under the charge of his son, Francesco, and with the\r\ngreater part of his troops, went into Lombardy, where joining the\r\nremainder of the duke's forces, he attacked the country about Brescia,\r\nand having soon completely conquered it, besieged the city itself.\r\n\r\nThe duke, who desired the Venetians to be left defenseless, excused\r\nhimself to the pope, the Florentines, and the count, saying, that if the\r\ndoings of Niccolo were contrary to the terms of the treaty, they were\r\nequally contrary to his wishes, and by secret messengers, assured them\r\nthat when an occasion presented itself, he would give them a convincing\r\nproof that they had been performed in disobedience to his instructions.\r\nNeither the count nor the Florentines believed him, but thought, with\r\nreason, that these enterprises had been carried on to keep them at\r\nbay, till he had subdued the Venetians, who, being full of pride, and\r\nthinking themselves able alone to resist the duke, had not deigned to\r\nask for any assistance, but carried on the war under their captain,\r\nGattamelata.\r\n\r\nCount Francesco would have wished, with the consent of the Florentines,\r\nto go to the assistance of king René, if the events of Romagna and\r\nLombardy had not hindered him; and the Florentines would willingly have\r\nconsented, from their ancient friendship to the French dynasty, but the\r\nduke was entirely in favor of Alfonso. Each being engaged in wars near\r\nhome, refrained from distant undertakings. The Florentines, finding\r\nRomagna occupied with the duke's forces, and the Venetians defeated, as\r\nif foreseeing their own ruin in that of others, entreated the count to\r\ncome to Tuscany, where they might consider what should be done to resist\r\nFilippo's power, which was now greater than it had ever before been;\r\nassuring him that if his insolence were not in some way curbed, all the\r\npowers of Italy would soon have to submit to him. The count felt the\r\nforce of the fears entertained by the Florentines, but his desire to\r\nsecure the duke's alliance kept him in suspense; and the duke, aware\r\nof this desire, gave him the greatest assurance that his hopes would\r\nbe realized as shortly as possible, if he abstained from hostilities\r\nagainst him. As the lady was now of marriageable age, the duke had\r\nfrequently made all suitable preparations for the celebration of the\r\nceremony, but on one pretext or another they had always been wholly set\r\naside. He now, to give the count greater confidence, added deeds to his\r\nwords, and sent him thirty thousand florins, which, by the terms of the\r\nmarriage contract, he had engaged to pay.\r\n\r\nStill the war in Lombardy proceeded with greater vehemence than ever;\r\nthe Venetians constantly suffered fresh losses of territory, and the\r\nfleets they equipped upon the rivers were taken by the duke's forces;\r\nthe country around Verona and Brescia was entirely occupied, and the\r\ntwo cities themselves so pressed, that their speedy fall was generally\r\nanticipated. The marquis of Mantua, who for many years had led the\r\nforces of their republic, quite unexpectedly resigned his command, and\r\nwent over to the duke's service. Thus the course which pride prevented\r\nthem from adopting at the commencement of the war, fear compelled them\r\nto take during its progress; for knowing there was no help for them but\r\nin the friendship of the Florentines and the count, they began to make\r\novertures to obtain it, though with shame and apprehension; for they\r\nwere afraid of receiving a reply similar to that which they had\r\ngiven the Florentines, when the latter applied for assistance in the\r\nenterprise against Lucca and the count's affairs. However, they found\r\nthe Florentines more easily induced to render aid than they expected, or\r\ntheir conduct deserved; so much more were the former swayed by hatred of\r\ntheir ancient enemy, than by resentment of the ingratitude of their\r\nold and habitual friends. Having foreseen the necessity into which the\r\nVenetians must come, they had informed the count that their ruin must\r\ninvolve his own; that he was deceived if he thought the duke, while\r\nfortune, would esteem him more than if he were in adversity; that the\r\nduke was induced to promise him his daughter by the fear he entertained\r\nof him; that what necessity occasions to be promised, it also causes to\r\nbe performed; and it was therefore desirable to keep the duke in that\r\nnecessity, which could be done without supporting the power of the\r\nVenetians. Therefore he might perceive, that if the Venetians were\r\ncompelled to abandon their inland territories, he would not only lose\r\nthe advantages derivable from them, but also those to be obtained from\r\nsuch as feared them; and that if he considered well the powers of\r\nItaly, he would see that some were poor, and others hostile; that the\r\nFlorentines alone were not, as he had often said, sufficient for his\r\nsupport; so that on every account it was best to keep the Venetians\r\npowerful by land. These arguments, conjoined with the hatred which the\r\ncount had conceived against Filippo, by supposing himself duped with\r\nregard to the promised alliance, induced him to consent to a new treaty;\r\nbut still he would not consent to cross the Po. The agreement was\r\nconcluded in February, 1438; the Venetians agreeing to pay two-thirds of\r\nthe expense of the war, the Florentines one-third, and each engaging to\r\ndefend the states which the count possessed in La Marca. Nor were these\r\nthe only forces of the league, for the lord of Faenza, the sons of\r\nPandolfo Malatesti da Rimino and Pietro Giampagolo Orsini also joined\r\nthem. They endeavored, by very liberal offers, to gain over the marquis\r\nof Mantua, but could not prevail against the friendship and stipend of\r\nthe duke; and the lord of Faenza, after having entered into compact with\r\nthe league, being tempted by more advantageous terms, went over to him.\r\nThis made them despair of being able to effect an early settlement of\r\nthe troubles of Romagna.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Lombardy were in this condition: Brescia was so closely\r\nbesieged by the duke's forces, that constant apprehensions were\r\nentertained of her being compelled by famine to a surrender; while\r\nVerona was so pressed, that a similar fate was expected to await her,\r\nand if one of these cities were lost, all the other preparations for the\r\nwar might be considered useless, and the expenses already incurred as\r\ncompletely wasted. For this there was no remedy, but to send the count\r\ninto Lombardy; and to this measure three obstacles presented themselves.\r\nThe first was, to induce him to cross the Po, and prosecute the war in\r\nwhatever locality might be found most advisable; the second, that the\r\ncount being at a distance, the Florentines would be left almost at the\r\nmercy of the duke, who, issuing from any of his fortresses, might with\r\npart of his troops keep the count at bay, and with the rest introduce\r\ninto Tuscany the Florentine exiles, whom the existing government already\r\ndreaded; the third was, to determine what route the count should take to\r\narrive safely in the Paduan territory, and join the Venetian forces. Of\r\nthese three difficulties, the second, which particularly regarded the\r\nFlorentines, was the most serious; but, knowing the necessity of the\r\ncase, and wearied out by the Venetians, who with unceasing importunity\r\ndemanded the count, intimating that without him they should abandon all\r\nhope, they resolved to relieve their allies rather than listen to the\r\nsuggestions of their own fears. There still remained the question about\r\nthe route to be taken, for the safety of which they determined the\r\nVenetians should provide; and as they had sent Neri Capponi to treat\r\nwith the count and induce him to cross the Po, they determined that the\r\nsame person should also proceed to Venice, in order to make the benefit\r\nthe more acceptable to the Signory, and see that all possible security\r\nwere given to the passage of the forces.\r\n\r\nNeri embarked at Cesena and went to Venice; nor was any prince ever\r\nreceived with so much honor as he was; for upon his arrival, and the\r\nmatters which his intervention was to decide and determine, the safety\r\nof the republic seemed to depend. Being introduced to the senate, and\r\nin presence of the Doge, he said, \"The Signory of Florence, most serene\r\nprince, has always perceived in the duke's greatness the source of ruin\r\nboth to this republic and our own, and that the safety of both states\r\ndepends upon their separate strength and mutual confidence. If such had\r\nbeen the opinion of this illustrious Signory, we should ourselves have\r\nbeen in better condition, and your republic would have been free from\r\nthe dangers that now threaten it. But as at the proper crisis you\r\nwithheld from us confidence and aid, we could not come to the relief of\r\nyour distress, nor could you, being conscious of this, freely ask us;\r\nfor neither in your prosperity nor adversity have you clearly perceived\r\nour motives. You have not observed, that those whose deeds have once\r\nincurred our hatred, can never become entitled to our regard; nor can\r\nthose who have once merited our affection ever after absolutely cancel\r\ntheir claim. Our attachment to your most serene Signory is well known to\r\nyou all, for you have often seen Lombardy filled with our forces and\r\nour money for your assistance. Our hereditary enmity to Filippo and his\r\nhouse is universally known, and it is impossible that love or hatred,\r\nstrengthened by the growth of years, can be eradicated from our minds\r\nby any recent act either of kindness or neglect. We have always thought,\r\nand are still of the same opinion, that we might now remain neutral,\r\ngreatly to the duke's satisfaction, and with little hazard to ourselves;\r\nfor if by your ruin he were to become lord of Lombardy, we should still\r\nhave sufficient influence in Italy in free us from any apprehension on\r\nour own account; for every increase of power and territory augments\r\nthat animosity and envy, from which arise wars and the dismemberment\r\nof states. We are also aware what heavy expenses and imminent perils we\r\nshould avoid, by declining to involve ourselves in these disputes;\r\nand how easily the field of battle may be transferred from Lombardy to\r\nTuscany, by our interference in your behalf. Yet all these apprehensions\r\nare at once overborne by our ancient affection for the senate and people\r\nof Venice, and we have resolved to come to your relief with the same\r\nzeal with which we should have armed in our own defense, had we been\r\nattacked. Therefore, the senate of Florence, judging it primarily\r\nnecessary to relieve Verona and Brescia, and thinking this impossible\r\nwithout the count, have sent me, in the first instance, to persuade\r\nhim to pass into Lombardy, and carry on the war wherever it may be most\r\nneedful; for you are aware he is under no obligation to cross the Po. To\r\ninduce him to do so, I have advanced such arguments as are suggested by\r\nthe circumstances themselves, and which would prevail with us. He, being\r\ninvincible in arms, cannot be surpassed in courtesy, and the liberality\r\nhe sees the Florentines exercise toward you, he has resolved to outdo;\r\nfor he is well aware to what dangers Tuscany will be exposed after\r\nhis departure, and since we have made your affairs our primary\r\nconsideration, he has also resolved to make his own subservient to\r\nyours. I come, therefore, to tender his services, with seven thousand\r\ncavalry and two thousand infantry, ready at once to march against the\r\nenemy, wherever he may be. And I beg of you, so do my lords at Florence\r\nand the count, that as his forces exceed the number he has engaged to\r\nfurnish you, out of your liberality, would remunerate him, that he may\r\nnot repent of having come to your assistance, nor we, who have prevailed\r\nwith him to do so.\" This discourse of Neri to the senate was listened\r\nto with that profound attention which an oracle might be imagined to\r\ncommand; and his audience were so moved by it, that they could not\r\nrestrain themselves, till the prince had replied, as strict decorum\r\non such occasions required, but rising from their seats, with uplifted\r\nhands, and most of them with tears in their eyes, they thanked the\r\nFlorentines for their generous conduct, and the ambassador for his\r\nunusual dispatch; and promised that time should never cancel the\r\nremembrance of such goodness, either in their own hearts, or their\r\nchildren's; and that their country, thenceforth, should be common to the\r\nFlorentines with themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFrancesco Sforza marches to assist the Venetians, and relieves\r\nVerona--He attempts to relieve Brescia but fails--The Venetians routed\r\nby Piccinino upon the Lake of Garda--Piccinino routed by Sforza;\r\nthe method of his escape--Piccinino surprises Verona--Description of\r\nVerona--Recovered by Sforza--The duke of Milan makes war against the\r\nFlorentines--Apprehensions of the Florentines--Cardinal Vitelleschi\r\ntheir enemy.\r\n\r\nWhen their demonstrations of gratitude had subsided, the Venetian\r\nsenate, by the aid of Neri di Gino, began to consider the route the\r\ncount ought to take, and how to provide him with necessaries. There were\r\nfour several roads; one by Ravenna, along the beach, which on account of\r\nits being in many places interrupted by the sea and by marshes, was not\r\napproved. The next was the most direct, but rendered inconvenient by a\r\ntower called the Uccellino, which being held for the duke, it would be\r\nnecessary to capture; and to do this, would occupy more time than could\r\nbe spared with safety to Verona and Brescia. The third was by the brink\r\nof the lake; but as the Po had overflowed its banks, to pass in this\r\ndirection was impossible. The fourth was by the way of Bologna to Ponte\r\nPuledrano, Cento, and Pieve; then between the Bondeno and the Finale\r\nto Ferrara, and thence they might by land or water enter the Paduan\r\nterritory, and join the Venetian forces. This route, though attended\r\nwith many difficulties, and in some parts liable to be disputed by the\r\nenemy, was chosen as the least objectionable. The count having received\r\nhis instructions, commenced his march, and by exerting the utmost\r\ncelerity, reached the Paduan territory on the twentieth of June. The\r\narrival of this distinguished commander in Lombardy filled Venice and\r\nall her dependencies with hope; for the Venetians, who only an instant\r\nbefore had been in fear for their very existence, began to contemplate\r\nnew conquests.\r\n\r\nThe count, before he made any other attempt, hastened to the relief of\r\nVerona; and to counteract his design, Niccolo led his forces to Soave, a\r\ncastle situated between the Vincentino and the Veronese, and entrenched\r\nhimself by a ditch that extended from Soave to the marshes of the Adige.\r\nThe count, finding his passage by the plain cut off, resolved to proceed\r\nby the mountains, and thus reach Verona, thinking Niccolo would imagine\r\nthis way to be so rugged and elevated as to be impracticable, or if\r\nhe thought otherwise, he would not be in time to prevent him; so, with\r\nprovisions for eight days, he took the mountain path, and with his\r\nforces, arrived in the plain, below Soave. Niccolo had, even upon this\r\nroute, erected some bastions for the purpose of preventing him, but they\r\nwere insufficient for the purpose; and finding the enemy had, contrary\r\nto his expectations, effected a passage, to avoid a disadvantageous\r\nengagement he crossed to the opposite side of the Adige, and the count\r\nentered Verona without opposition.\r\n\r\nHaving happily succeeded in his first project, that of relieving Verona,\r\nthe count now endeavored to render a similar service to Brescia. This\r\ncity is situated so close to the Lake of Garda, that although besieged\r\nby land, provisions may always be sent into it by water. On this account\r\nthe duke had assembled a large force in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nlake, and at the commencement of his victories occupied all the places\r\nwhich by its means might relieve Brescia. The Venetians also had galleys\r\nupon the lake, but they were unequal to a contest with those of the\r\nduke. The count therefore deemed it advisable to aid the Venetian fleet\r\nwith his land forces, by which means he hoped to obtain without much\r\ndifficulty those places which kept Brescia in blockade. He therefore\r\nencamped before Bardolino, a fortress situated upon the lake, trusting\r\nthat after it was taken the others would surrender. But fortune opposed\r\nthis design, for a great part of his troops fell sick; so, giving up\r\nthe enterprise, he went to Zevio, a Veronese castle, in a healthy and\r\nplentiful situation. Niccolo, upon the count's retreat, not to let slip\r\nan opportunity of making himself master of the lake, left his camp at\r\nVegasio, and with a body of picked men took the way thither, attacked\r\nthe Venetian fleet with the utmost impetuosity, and took nearly the\r\nwhole of it. By this victory almost all the fortresses upon the lake\r\nfell into his hands.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians, alarmed at this loss, and fearing that in consequence\r\nof it Brescia would surrender, solicited the count, by letters and\r\nmessengers, to go to its relief; and he, perceiving that all hope of\r\nrendering assistance from the lake was cut off, and that to attempt\r\nan approach by land, on account of the ditches, bastions, and other\r\ndefenses erected by Niccolo, was marching to certain destruction,\r\ndetermined that as the passage by the mountains had enabled him to\r\nrelieve Verona, it should also contribute to the preservation of\r\nBrescia. Having taken this resolution, the count left Zevio, and by way\r\nof the Val d'Acri went to the Lake of St. Andrea, and thence to Torboli\r\nand Peneda, upon the Lake of Garda. He then proceeded to Tenna, and\r\nbesieged the fortress, which it was necessary to occupy before he could\r\nreach Brescia.\r\n\r\nNiccolo, on being acquainted with the count's design, led his army to\r\nPeschiera. He then, with the marquis of Mantua and a chosen body of men,\r\nwent to meet him, and coming to an engagement, was routed, his people\r\ndispersed, and many of them taken, while others fled to the fleet, and\r\nsome to the main body of his army. It was now nightfall, and Niccolo\r\nhad escaped to Tenna, but he knew that if he were to remain there till\r\nmorning, he must inevitably fall into the enemy's hands; therefore, to\r\navoid a catastrophe which might be regarded as almost fatal, he resolved\r\nto make a dangerous experiment. Of all his attendants he had only with\r\nhim a single servant, a Dutchman, of great personal strength, and who\r\nhad always been devotedly attached to him. Niccolo induced this man\r\nto take him upon his shoulders in a sack, as if he had been carrying\r\nproperty of his master's, and to bear him to a place of security. The\r\nenemy's lines surrounded Tenna, but on account of the previous day's\r\nvictory, all was in disorder, and no guard was kept, so that the\r\nDutchman, disguised as a trooper, passed through them without any\r\nopposition, and brought his master in safety to his own troops.\r\n\r\nHad this victory been as carefully improved as it was fortunately\r\nobtained, Brescia would have derived from it greater relief and the\r\nVenetians more permanent advantage; but they, having thoughtlessly let\r\nit slip, the rejoicings were soon over, and Brescia remained in her\r\nformer difficulties. Niccolo, having returned to his forces, resolved by\r\nsome extraordinary exertion to cancel the impression of his death,\r\nand deprive the Venetians of the change of relieving Brescia. He was\r\nacquainted with the topography of the citadel of Verona, and had learned\r\nfrom prisoners whom he had taken, that it was badly guarded, and might\r\nbe very easily recovered. He perceived at once that fortune presented\r\nhim with an opportunity of regaining the laurels he had lately lost, and\r\nof changing the joy of the enemy for their recent victory into sorrow\r\nfor a succeeding disaster. The city of Verona is situated in Lombardy,\r\nat the foot of the mountains which divide Italy from Germany, so that\r\nit occupies part both of hill and plain. The river Adige rises in the\r\nvalley of Trento, and entering Italy, does not immediately traverse the\r\ncountry, but winding to the left, along the base of the hills, enters\r\nVerona, and crosses the city, which it divides unequally, giving much\r\nthe larger portion to the plain. On the mountain side of the river are\r\ntwo fortresses, formidable rather from their situation than from their\r\nactual strength, for being very elevated they command the whole place.\r\nOne is called San Piero, the other San Felice. On the opposite side of\r\nthe Adige, upon the plain, with their backs against the city walls, are\r\ntwo other fortresses, about a mile distant from each other, one called\r\nthe Old the other the New Citadel, and a wall extends between them that\r\nmay be compared to a bowstring, of which the city wall is the arc. The\r\nspace comprehended within this segment is very populous, and is called\r\nthe Borgo of St. Zeno. Niccolo Piccinino designed to capture these\r\nfortresses and the Borgo, and he hoped to succeed without much\r\ndifficulty, as well on account of the ordinary negligence of the guard,\r\nwhich their recent successes would probably increase, as because in\r\nwar no enterprise is more likely to be successful than one which by the\r\nenemy is deemed impossible. With a body of picked men, and accompanied\r\nby the marquis of Mantua, he proceeded by night to Verona, silently\r\nscaled the walls, and took the New Citadel: then entering the place with\r\nhis troops, he forced the gate of S. Antonio, and introduced the whole\r\nof his cavalry. The Venetian garrison of the Old Citadel hearing an\r\nuproar, when the guards of the New were slaughtered, and again when the\r\ngate was forced, being now aware of the presence of enemies, raised an\r\nalarm, and called the people to arms. The citizens awaking in the\r\nutmost confusion, some of the boldest armed and hastened to the rector's\r\npiazza. In the meantime, Niccolo's forces had pillaged the Borgo of San\r\nZeno; and proceeding onward were ascertained by the people to be the\r\nduke's forces, but being defenseless they advised the Venetian rectors\r\nto take refuge in the fortresses, and thus save themselves and the\r\nplace; as it was more advisable to preserve their lives and so rich a\r\ncity for better fortune, than by endeavoring to repel the present evil,\r\nencounter certain death, and incur universal pillage. Upon this the\r\nrectors and all the Venetian party, fled to the fortress of San Felice.\r\nSome of the first citizens, anxious to avoid being plundered by the\r\ntroops, presented themselves before Niccolo and the marquis of Mantua,\r\nand begged they would rather take possession of a rich city, with honor\r\nto themselves, than of a poor one to their own disgrace; particularly as\r\nthey had not induced either the favor of its former possessors, or\r\nthe animosity of its present masters, by self-defense. The marquis and\r\nNiccolo encouraged them, and protected their property to the utmost of\r\ntheir power during such a state of military license. As they felt sure\r\nthe count would endeavor to recover the city, they made every possible\r\nexertion to gain possession of the fortresses, and those they could not\r\nseize they cut off from the rest of the place by ditches and barricades,\r\nso that the enemy might be shut out.\r\n\r\nThe Count Francesco was with his army at Tenna; and when the report was\r\nfirst brought to him he refused to credit it; but being assured of\r\nthe fact by parties whom it would have been ridiculous to doubt, he\r\nresolved, by the exertion of uncommon celerity, to repair the evil\r\nnegligence had occasioned; and though all his officers advised the\r\nabandonment of Verona and Brescia, and a march to Vicenza, lest he\r\nmight be besieged by the enemy in his present situation, he refused, but\r\nresolved to attempt the recovery of Verona. During the consultation, he\r\nturned to the Venetian commissaries and to Bernardo de' Medici, who was\r\nthere as commissary for the Florentines, and promised them the recovery\r\nof the place if one of the fortresses should hold out. Having collected\r\nhis forces, he proceeded with the utmost speed to Verona. Observing his\r\napproach, Niccolo thought he designed, according to the advice he had\r\nreceived, to go to Vicenza, but finding him continue to draw near, and\r\ntaking the direction of San Felice, he prepared for its defense--though\r\ntoo late; for the barricades were not completed; his men were dispersed\r\nin quest of plunder, or extorting money from the inhabitants by way of\r\nransom; and he could not collect them in time to prevent the count's\r\ntroops from entering the fortress. They then descended into the city,\r\nwhich they happily recovered, to Niccolo's disgrace, and with the loss\r\nof great numbers of his men. He himself, with the marquis of Mantua,\r\nfirst took refuge in the citadel, and thence escaping into the country,\r\nfled to Mantua, where, having assembled the relics of their army, they\r\nhastened to join those who were at the siege of Brescia. Thus in four\r\ndays Verona was lost and again recovered from the duke. The count, after\r\nthis victory, it being now winter and the weather very severe, having\r\nfirst with considerable difficulty thrown provisions into Brescia,\r\nwent into quarters at Verona, and ordered, that during the cold season,\r\ngalleys should be provided at Torboli, that upon the return of spring,\r\nthey might be in a condition to proceed vigorously to effect the\r\npermanent relief of Brescia.\r\n\r\nThe duke, finding the war suspended for a time, the hope he had\r\nentertained of occupying Brescia and Verona annihilated, and the money\r\nand counsels of the Florentines the cause of this, and seeing that\r\nneither the injuries they had received from the Venetians could alienate\r\nthem, nor all the promises he had made attach them to himself, he\r\ndetermined, in order to make them feel more closely the effects of the\r\ncourse they had adopted, to attack Tuscany; to which he was strenuously\r\nadvised by the Florentine exiles and Niccolo. The latter advocated this\r\nfrom his desire to recover the states of Braccio, and expel the count\r\nfrom La Marca; the former, from their wish to return home, and each\r\nby suitable arguments endeavored to induce the duke to follow the plan\r\ncongenial to their own views. Niccolo argued that he might be sent into\r\nTuscany, and continue the siege of Brescia; for he was master of\r\nthe lake, the fortresses were well provided, and their officers were\r\nqualified to oppose the count should he undertake any fresh enterprise;\r\nwhich it was not likely he would do without first relieving Brescia, a\r\nthing impossible; and thus the duke might carry on the war in Tuscany,\r\nwithout giving up his attempts in Lombardy; intimating that the\r\nFlorentines would be compelled, as soon as he entered Tuscany, to recall\r\nthe count to avoid complete ruin; and whatever course they took, victory\r\nto the duke must be the result. The exiles affirmed, that if Niccolo\r\nwith his army were to approach Florence, the people oppressed with\r\ntaxes, and wearied out by the insolence of the great, would most\r\nassuredly not oppose him, and pointed out the facility of reaching\r\nFlorence; for the way by the Casentino would be open to them, through\r\nthe friendship of Rinaldo and the Count di Poppi; and thus the duke,\r\nwho was previously inclined to the attempt, was induced by their joint\r\npersuasions to make it. The Venetians, on the other hand, though the\r\nwinter was severe, incessantly urged the count to relieve Brescia with\r\nall his forces. The count questioned the possibility of so doing, and\r\nadvised them to wait the return of spring, in the meantime strengthening\r\ntheir fleet as much as possible, and then assist it both by land and\r\nwater. This rendered the Venetians dissatisfied; they were dilatory in\r\nfurnishing provisions, and consequently many deserted from their army.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines, being informed of these transactions, became alarmed,\r\nperceiving the war threatening themselves, and the little progress made\r\nin Lombardy. Nor did the suspicion entertained by them of the troops of\r\nthe church give them less uneasiness; not that the pope was their enemy,\r\nbut because they saw those forces more under the sway of the patriarch,\r\nwho was their greatest foe. Giovanni Vitelleschi of Corneto was at first\r\napostolic notary, then bishop of Recanati, and afterward patriarch of\r\nAlexandria; but at last, becoming a cardinal, he was called Cardinal of\r\nFlorence. He was bold and cunning; and, having obtained great influence,\r\nwas appointed to command all the forces of the church, and conduct all\r\nthe enterprises of the pontiff, whether in Tuscany, Romagna, the kingdom\r\nof Naples, or in Rome. Hence he acquired so much power over the pontiff,\r\nand the papal troops, that the former was afraid of commanding him, and\r\nthe latter obeyed no one else. The cardinal's presence at Rome, when\r\nthe report came of Niccolo's design to march into Tuscany, redoubled the\r\nfear of the Florentines; for, since Rinaldo was expelled, he had become\r\nan enemy of the republic, from finding that the arrangements made by his\r\nmeans were not only disregarded, but converted to Rinaldo's prejudice,\r\nand caused the laying down of arms, which had given his enemies an\r\nopportunity of banishing him. In consequence of this, the government\r\nthought it would be advisable to restore and indemnify Rinaldo, in case\r\nNiccolo came into Tuscany and were joined by him. Their apprehensions\r\nwere increased by their being unable to account for Niccolo's departure\r\nfrom Lombardy, and his leaving one enterprise almost completed, to\r\nundertake another so entirely doubtful; which they could not reconcile\r\nwith their ideas of consistency, except by supposing some new design had\r\nbeen adopted, or some hidden treachery intended. They communicated their\r\nfears to the pope, who was now sensible of his error in having endowed\r\nthe cardinal with too much authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThe pope imprisons the cardinal and assists the Florentines--Difference\r\nof opinion between the count and the Venetians respecting the management\r\nof the war. The Florentines reconcile them--The count wishes to go into\r\nTuscany to oppose Piccinino, but is prevented by the Venetians--Niccolo\r\nPiccinino in Tuscany--He takes Marradi, and plunders the neighborhood\r\nof Florence--Description of Marradi--Cowardice of Bartolomeo\r\nOrlandini--Brave resistance of Castel San Niccolo--San Niccolo\r\nsurrenders--Piccinino attempts to take Cortona, but fails.\r\n\r\nWhile the Florentines were thus anxious, fortune disclosed the means of\r\nsecuring themselves against the patriarch's malevolence. The republic\r\neverywhere exercised the very closest espionage over epistolary\r\ncommunication, in order to discover if any persons were plotting against\r\nthe state. It happened that letters were intercepted at Monte Pulciano,\r\nwhich had been written by the patriarch to Niccolo without the pope's\r\nknowledge; and although they were written in an unusual character, and\r\nthe sense so involved that no distinct idea could be extracted, the\r\nobscurity itself, and the whole aspect of the matter so alarmed the\r\npontiff, that he resolved to seize the person of the cardinal, a duty he\r\ncommitted to Antonio Rido, of Padua, who had the command of the castle\r\nof St. Angelo, and who, after receiving his instructions, soon found\r\nan opportunity of carrying them into effect. The patriarch, having\r\ndetermined to go into Tuscany, prepared to leave Rome on the following\r\nday, and ordered the castellan to be upon the drawbridge of the fortress\r\nin the morning, for he wished to speak with him as he passed. Antonio\r\nperceived this to be the favorable moment, informed his people what they\r\nwere to do, and awaited the arrival of the patriarch upon the bridge,\r\nwhich adjoined the building, and might for the purpose of security be\r\nraised or lowered as occasion required. The appointed time found him\r\npunctual; and Antonio, having drawn him, as if for the convenience\r\nof conversation, on to the bridge, gave a signal to his men, who\r\nimmediately raised it, and in a moment the cardinal, from being a\r\ncommander of armies, found himself a prisoner of the castellan. The\r\npatriarch's followers at first began to use threats, but being informed\r\nof the pope's directions they were appeased. The castellan comforting\r\nhim with kind words, he replied, that \"the great do not make each other\r\nprisoners to let them go again; and that those whom it is proper to\r\ntake, it is not well to set free.\" He shortly afterward died in prison.\r\nThe pope appointed Lodovico, patriarch of Aquileia, to command his\r\ntroops; and, though previously unwilling to interfere in the wars of\r\nthe league and the duke, he was now content to take part in them, and\r\nengaged to furnish four thousand horse and two thousand foot for the\r\ndefense of Tuscany.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines, freed from this cause for anxiety, were still\r\napprehensive of Niccolo, and feared confusion in the affairs of\r\nLombardy, from the differences of opinion that existed between the count\r\nand the Venetians. In order the better to become acquainted with the\r\nintentions of the parties, they sent Neri di Gini Capponi and Giuliano\r\nDavanzati to Venice, with instructions to assist in the arrangement of\r\nthe approaching campaign; and ordered that Neri, having discovered how\r\nthe Venetians were disposed, should proceed to the count, learn\r\nhis designs, and induce him to adopt the course that would be most\r\nadvantageous to the League. The ambassadors had only reached Ferrara,\r\nwhen they were told that Niccolo Piccinino had crossed the Po with six\r\nthousand horse. This made them travel with increased speed; and, having\r\narrived at Venice, they found the Signory fully resolved that Brescia\r\nshould be relieved without waiting for the return of spring; for they\r\nsaid that \"the city would be unable to hold out so long, the fleet could\r\nnot be in readiness, and that seeing no more immediate relief, she would\r\nsubmit to the enemy; which would render the duke universally victorious,\r\nand cause them to lose the whole of their inland possessions.\" Neri then\r\nproceeded to Verona to ascertain the count's opinion, who argued, for\r\nmany reasons, that to march to Brescia before the return of spring would\r\nbe quite useless, or even worse; for the situation of Brescia, being\r\nconsidered in conjunction with the season, nothing could be expected to\r\nresult but disorder and fruitless toil to the troops; so that, when the\r\nsuitable period should arrive, he would be compelled to return to Verona\r\nwith his army, to recover from the injuries sustained in the winter, and\r\nprovide necessaries for the summer; and thus the time available for the\r\nwar would be wasted in marching and countermarching. Orsatto Justiniani\r\nand Giovanni Pisani were deputed on the part of Venice to the count at\r\nVerona, having been sent to consider these affairs, and with them it was\r\nagreed that the Venetians should pay the count ninety thousand ducats\r\nfor the coming year, and to each of the soldiers forty ducats; that he\r\nshould set out immediately with the whole army and attack the duke, in\r\norder to compel him, for his own preservation, to recall Niccolo into\r\nLombardy. After this agreement the ambassadors returned to Venice; and\r\nthe Venetians, having so large an amount of money to raise, were very\r\nremiss with their commissariat.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Niccolo Piccinino pursued his route, and arrived in\r\nRomagna, where he prevailed upon the sons of Pandolfo Malatesti to\r\ndesert the Venetians and enter the duke's service. This circumstance\r\noccasioned much uneasiness in Venice, and still more at Florence;\r\nfor they thought that with the aid of the Malatesti they might resist\r\nNiccolo; but finding them gone over to the enemy, they were in fear lest\r\ntheir captain, Piero Giampagolo Orsini, who was in the territories of\r\nthe Malatesti, should be disarmed and rendered powerless. The count also\r\nfelt alarmed, for, through Niccolo's presence in Tuscany, he was\r\nafraid of losing La Marca; and, urged by a desire to look after his\r\nown affairs, he hastened to Venice, and being introduced to the Doge,\r\ninformed him that the interests of the League required his presence in\r\nTuscany; for the war ought to be carried on where the leader and forces\r\nof the enemy were, and not where his garrisons and towns were situated;\r\nfor when the army is vanquished the war is finished; but to take towns\r\nand leave the armament entire, usually allowed the war to break out\r\nagain with greater virulence; that Tuscany and La Marca would be lost if\r\nNiccolo were not vigorously resisted, and that, if lost, there would be\r\nno possibility of the preservation of Lombardy. But supposing the\r\ndanger to Lombardy not so imminent, he did not intend to abandon his own\r\nsubjects and friends, and that having come into Lombardy as a prince, he\r\ndid not intend to return a mere condottiere. To this the Doge replied,\r\nit was quite manifest that, if he left Lombardy, or even recrossed the\r\nPo, all their inland territories would be lost; in that case they were\r\nunwilling to spend any more money in their defense. For it would be\r\nfolly to attempt defending a place which must, after all, inevitably\r\nbe lost; and that it is less disgraceful and less injurious to lose\r\ndominions only, then to lose both territory and money. That if the loss\r\nof their inland possessions should actually result, it would then be\r\nseen how highly important to the preservation of Romagna and Tuscany\r\nthe reputation of the Venetians had been. On these accounts they were of\r\nquite a different opinion from the count; for they saw that whoever was\r\nvictor in Lombardy would be so everywhere else, that conquest would be\r\neasily attainable now, when the territories of the duke were left almost\r\ndefenseless by the departure of Niccolo, and that he would be ruined\r\nbefore he could order Niccolo's recall, or provide himself with any\r\nother remedy; that whoever attentively considered these things would\r\nsee, that the duke had sent Niccolo into Tuscany for no other reason\r\nthan to withdraw the count from his enterprise, and cause the war, which\r\nwas now at his own door, to be removed to a greater distance. That if\r\nthe count were to follow Niccolo, unless at the instigation of some very\r\npressing necessity, he would find his plan successful, and rejoice in\r\nthe adoption of it; but if he were to remain in Lombardy, and allow\r\nTuscany to shift for herself, the duke would, when too late, see the\r\nimprudence of his conduct, and find that he had lost his territories in\r\nLombardy and gained nothing in Tuscany. Each party having spoken, it\r\nwas determined to wait a few days to see what would result from the\r\nagreement of the Malatesti with Niccolo; whether the Florentines could\r\navail themselves of Piero Giampagolo, and whether the pope intended to\r\njoin the League with all the earnestness he had promised. Not many\r\ndays after these resolutions were adopted, it was ascertained that the\r\nMalatesti had made the agreement more from fear than any ill-will toward\r\nthe League; that Piero Giampagolo had proceeded with his force toward\r\nTuscany, and that the pope was more disposed than ever to assist\r\nthem. This favorable intelligence dissipated the count's fears, and he\r\nconsented to remain in Lombardy, and that Neri Capponi should return\r\nto Florence with a thousand of his own horse, and five hundred from the\r\nother parties. It was further agreed, that if the affairs of Tuscany\r\nshould require the count's presence, Neri should write to him, and he\r\nwould proceed thither to the exclusion of every other consideration.\r\nNeri arrived at Florence with his forces in April, and Giampagolo joined\r\nthem the same day.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Niccolo Piccinino, the affairs of Romagna being\r\nsettled, purposed making a descent into Tuscany, and designing to go by\r\nthe mountain passes of San Benedetto and the valley of Montone, found\r\nthem so well guarded by the contrivance of Niccolo da Pisa, that his\r\nutmost exertions would be useless in that direction. As the Florentines,\r\nupon this sudden attack, were unprovided with troops and officers, they\r\nhad sent into the defiles of these hills many of their citizens,\r\nwith infantry raised upon the emergency to guard them, among whom was\r\nBartolomeo Orlandini, a cavaliere, to whom was intrusted the defense\r\nof the castle of Marradi and the adjacent passes. Niccolo Piccinino,\r\nfinding the route by San Benedetto impracticable, on account of the\r\nbravery of its commander, thought the cowardice of the officer who\r\ndefended that of Marradi would render the passage easy. Marradi is a\r\ncastle situated at the foot of the mountains which separate Tuscany from\r\nRomagna; and, though destitute of walls, the river, the mountains, and\r\nthe inhabitants, make it a place of great strength; for the peasantry\r\nare warlike and faithful, and the rapid current undermining the banks\r\nhas left them of such tremendous height that it is impossible to\r\napproach it from the valley if a small bridge over the stream be\r\ndefended; while on the mountain side the precipices are so steep and\r\nperpendicular as to render it almost impregnable. In spite of these\r\nadvantages, the pusillanimity of Bartolomeo Orlandini rendered the men\r\ncowardly and the fortress untenable; for as soon as he heard of the\r\nenemy's approach he abandoned the place, fled with all his forces, and\r\ndid not stop till he reached the town of San Lorenzo. Niccolo, entering\r\nthe deserted fortress, wondered it had not been defended, and, rejoicing\r\nover his acquisition, descended into the valley of the Mugello, where\r\nhe took some castles, and halted with his army at Pulicciano. Thence he\r\noverran the country as far as the mountains of Fiesole; and his audacity\r\nso increased that he crossed the Arno, plundering and destroying\r\neverything to within three miles of Florence.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines, however, were not dismayed. Their first concern was\r\nto give security to the government, for which they had no cause for\r\napprehension, so universal was the good will of the people toward Cosmo;\r\nand besides this, they had restricted the principal offices to a few\r\ncitizens of the highest class, who with their vigilance would have kept\r\nthe populace in order, even if they had been discontented or desirous of\r\nchange. They also knew by the compact made in Lombardy what forces\r\nNeri would bring with him, and expected the troops of the pope. These\r\nprospects sustained their courage till the arrival of Neri di Gino, who,\r\non account of the disorders and fears of the city, determined to set out\r\nimmediately and check Niccolo. With the cavalry he possessed, and a body\r\nof infantry raised entirely from the people, he recovered Remole from\r\nthe hands of the enemy, where having encamped, he put a stop to all\r\nfurther depredations, and gave the inhabitants hopes of repelling\r\nthe enemy from the neighborhood. Niccolo finding that, although the\r\nFlorentines were without troops, no disturbance had arisen, and learning\r\nwhat entire composure prevailed in the city, thought he was wasting\r\ntime, and resolved to undertake some other enterprise to induce them to\r\nsend forces after him, and give him a chance of coming to an engagement,\r\nby means of which, if victorious, he trusted everything would succeed to\r\nhis wishes.\r\n\r\nFrancesco, Count di Poppi, was in the army of Niccolo, having deserted\r\nthe Florentines, with whom he was in league, when the enemy entered the\r\nMugello; and though with the intention of securing him as soon as they\r\nhad an idea of his design, they increased his appointments, and made him\r\ncommissary over all the places in his vicinity; still, so powerful is\r\nthe attachment to party, that no benefit or fear could eradicate the\r\naffection he bore toward Rinaldo and the late government; so that as\r\nsoon as he knew Niccolo was at hand he joined him, and with the utmost\r\nsolicitude entreated him to leave the city and pass into the Casentino,\r\npointing out to him the strength of the country, and how easily he might\r\nthence harass his enemies. Niccolo followed his advice, and arriving\r\nin the Casentino, took Romena and Bibbiena, and then pitched his camp\r\nbefore Castel San Niccolo. This fortress is situated at the foot of the\r\nmountains which divide the Casentino from the Val d'Arno; and being in\r\nan elevated situation, and well garrisoned, it was difficult to take,\r\nthough Niccolo, with catapults and other engines, assailed it without\r\nintermission. The siege had continued more than twenty days, during\r\nwhich the Florentines had collected all their forces, having assembled\r\nunder several leaders, three thousand horse, at Fegghine, commanded by\r\nPiero Giampagolo Orsini, their captain, and Neri Capponi and Bernardo\r\nde' Medici, commissaries. Four messengers, from Castel San Niccolo, were\r\nsent to them to entreat succor. The commissaries having examined the\r\nsite, found it could not be relieved, except from the Alpine regions,\r\nin the direction of the Val d'Arno, the summit of which was more easily\r\nattainable by the enemy than by themselves, on account of their greater\r\nproximity, and because the Florentines could not approach without\r\nobservation; so that it would be making a desperate attempt, and might\r\noccasion the destruction of the forces. The commissaries, therefore,\r\ncommended their fidelity, and ordered that when they could hold out no\r\nlonger, they should surrender. Niccolo took the fortress after a siege\r\nof thirty-two days; and the loss of so much time, for the attainment\r\nof so small an advantage, was the principle cause of the failure of his\r\nexpedition; for had he remained with his forces near Florence, he would\r\nhave almost deprived the government of all power to compel the citizens\r\nto furnish money: nor would they so easily have assembled forces and\r\ntaken other precautions, if the enemy had been close upon them, as\r\nthey did while he was at a distance. Besides this, many would have been\r\ndisposed to quiet their apprehensions of Niccolo, by concluding a peace;\r\nparticularly, as the contest was likely to be of some duration. The\r\ndesire of the Count di Poppi to avenge himself on the inhabitants of\r\nSan Niccolo, long his enemies, occasioned his advice to Piccinino, who\r\nadopted it for the purpose of pleasing him; and this caused the ruin\r\nof both. It seldom happens, that the gratification of private feelings,\r\nfails to be injurious to the general convenience.\r\n\r\nNiccolo, pursuing his good fortune, took Rassina and Chiusi. The Count\r\ndi Poppi advised him to halt in these parts, arguing that he might\r\ndivide his people between Chiusi, Caprese, and the Pieve, render himself\r\nmaster of this branch of the Apennines, and descend at pleasure into the\r\nCasentino, the Val d'Arno, the Val di Chiane, or the Val di Tavere,\r\nas well as be prepared for every movement of the enemy. But Niccolo,\r\nconsidering the sterility of these places, told him, \"his horses could\r\nnot eat stones,\" and went to the Borgo San Sepolcro, where he was\r\namicably received, but found that the people of Citta di Castello, who\r\nwere friendly to the Florentines, could not be induced to yield to his\r\novertures. Wishing to have Perugia at his disposal, he proceeded\r\nthither with forty horse, and being one of her citizens, met with a kind\r\nreception. But in a few days he became suspected, and having attempted\r\nunsuccessfully to tamper with the legate and people of Perugia, he took\r\neight thousand ducats from them, and returned to his army. He then set\r\non foot secret measures, to seduce Cortona from the Florentines, but\r\nthe affair being discovered, his attempts were fruitless. Among the\r\nprincipal citizens was Bartolomeo di Senso, who being appointed to the\r\nevening watch of one of the gates, a countryman, his friend, told him,\r\nthat if he went he would be slain. Bartolomeo, requesting to know what\r\nwas meant, he became acquainted with the whole affair, and revealed it\r\nto the governor of the place, who, having secured the leaders of the\r\nconspiracy, and doubled the guards at the gates, waited till the time\r\nappointed for the coming of Niccolo, who finding his purpose discovered,\r\nreturned to his encampment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBrescia relieved by Sforza--His other victories--Piccinino is\r\nrecalled into Lombardy--He endeavors to bring the Florentines to an\r\nengagement--He is routed before Anghiari--Serious disorders in the\r\ncamp of the Florentines after the victory--Death of Rinaldo degli\r\nAlbizzi--His character--Neri Capponi goes to recover the Casentino--The\r\nCount di Poppi surrenders--His discourse upon quitting his possessions.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were taking place in Tuscany, so little to the\r\nadvantage of the duke, his affairs in Lombardy were in a still worse\r\ncondition. The Count Francesco, as soon as the season would permit, took\r\nthe field with his army, and the Venetians having again covered the lake\r\nwith their galleys, he determined first of all to drive the duke from\r\nthe water; judging, that this once effected, his remaining task would be\r\neasy. He therefore, with the Venetian fleet, attacked that of the duke,\r\nand destroyed it. His land forces took the castles held for Filippo,\r\nand the ducal troops who were besieging Brescia, being informed of\r\nthese transactions, withdrew; and thus, the city, after standing a three\r\nyears' siege, was at length relieved. The count then went in quest\r\nof the enemy, whose forces were encamped before Soncino, a fortress\r\nsituated upon the River Oglio; these he dislodged and compelled to\r\nretreat to Cremona, where the duke again collected his forces, and\r\nprepared for his defense. But the count constantly pressing him more\r\nclosely, he became apprehensive of losing either the whole, or the\r\ngreater part, of his territories; and perceiving the unfortunate step\r\nhe had taken, in sending Niccolo into Tuscany, in order to correct his\r\nerror, he wrote to acquaint him with what had transpired, desiring him,\r\nwith all possible dispatch, to leave Tuscany and return to Lombardy.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Florentines, under their commissaries, had drawn\r\ntogether their forces, and being joined by those of the pope, halted at\r\nAnghiari, a castle placed at the foot of the mountains that divide the\r\nVal di Tavere from the Val di Chiane, distant four miles from the\r\nBorgo San Sepolcro, on a level road, and in a country suitable for the\r\nevolutions of cavalry or a battlefield. As the Signory had heard of the\r\ncount's victory and the recall of Niccolo, they imagined that without\r\nagain drawing a sword or disturbing the dust under their horses' feet,\r\nthe victory was their own, and the war at an end, they wrote to the\r\ncommissaries, desiring them to avoid an engagement, as Niccolo could\r\nnot remain much longer in Tuscany. These instructions coming to the\r\nknowledge of Piccinino, and perceiving the necessity of his speedy\r\nreturn, to leave nothing unattempted, he determined to engage the enemy,\r\nexpecting to find them unprepared, and not disposed for battle. In this\r\ndetermination he was confirmed by Rinaldo, the Count di Poppi, and other\r\nFlorentine exiles, who saw their inevitable ruin in the departure of\r\nNiccolo, and hoped, that if he engaged the enemy, they would either\r\nbe victorious, or vanquished without dishonor. This resolution being\r\nadopted, Niccolo led his army, unperceived by the enemy, from Citta di\r\nCastello to the Borgo, where he enlisted two thousand men, who, trusting\r\nthe general's talents and promises, followed him in hope of plunder.\r\nNiccolo then led his forces in battle array toward Anghiari, and\r\nhad arrived within two miles of the place, when Micheletto Attendulo\r\nobserved great clouds of dust, and conjecturing at once, that it must\r\nbe occasioned by the enemy's approach, immediately called the troops to\r\narms. Great confusion prevailed in the Florentine camp, for the ordinary\r\nnegligence and want of discipline were now increased by their presuming\r\nthe enemy to be at a distance, and they were more disposed to fight than\r\nto battle; so that everyone was unarmed, and some wandering from the\r\ncamp, either led by their desire to avoid the excessive heat, or in\r\npursuit of amusement. So great was the diligence of the commissaries and\r\nof the captain, that before the enemy's arrival, the men were mounted\r\nand prepared to resist their attack; and as Micheletto was the first to\r\nobserve their approach, he was also first armed and ready to meet them,\r\nand with his troops hastened to the bridge which crosses the river at a\r\nshort distance from Anghiari. Pietro Giampagolo having previous to the\r\nsurprise, filled up the ditches on either side of the road, and leveled\r\nthe ground between the bridge and Anghiari, and Micheletto having taken\r\nhis position in front of the former, the legate and Simoncino, who led\r\nthe troops of the church, took post on the right, and the commissaries\r\nof the Florentines, with Pietro Giampagolo, their captain, on the left;\r\nthe infantry being drawn up along the banks of the river. Thus, the only\r\ncourse the enemy could take, was the direct one over the bridge; nor\r\nhad the Florentines any other field for their exertions, excepting that\r\ntheir infantry were ordered, in case their cavalry were attacked in\r\nflank by the hostile infantry, to assail them with their cross bows, and\r\nprevent them from wounding the flanks of the horses crossing the bridge.\r\nMicheletto bravely withstood the enemy's charge upon the bridge; but\r\nAstorre and Francesco Piccinino coming up, with a picked body of men,\r\nattacked him so vigorously, that he was compelled to give way, and\r\nwas pushed as far as the foot of the hill which rises toward the Borgo\r\nd'Anghiari; but they were in turn repulsed and driven over the bridge,\r\nby the troops that took them in flank. The battle continued two hours,\r\nduring which each side had frequent possession of the bridge, and their\r\nattempts upon it were attended with equal success; but on both sides of\r\nthe river, the disadvantage of Niccolo was manifest; for when his people\r\ncrossed the bridge, they found the enemy unbroken, and the ground\r\nbeing leveled, they could manoeuvre without difficulty, and the weary\r\nbe relieved by such as were fresh. But when the Florentines crossed,\r\nNiccolo could not relieve those that were harassed, on account of the\r\nhindrance interposed by the ditches and embankments on each side of the\r\nroad; thus whenever his troops got possession of the bridge, they were\r\nsoon repulsed by the fresh forces of the Florentines; but when the\r\nbridge was taken by the Florentines, and they passed over and proceeded\r\nupon the road, Niccolo having no opportunity to reinforce his troops,\r\nbeing prevented by the impetuosity of the enemy and the inconvenience of\r\nthe ground, the rear guard became mingled with the van, and occasioned\r\nthe utmost confusion and disorder; they were forced to flee, and\r\nhastened at full speed toward the Borgo. The Florentine troops fell upon\r\nthe plunder, which was very valuable in horses, prisoners, and military\r\nstores, for not more than a thousand of the enemy's cavalry reached the\r\ntown. The people of the Borgo, who had followed Niccolo in the hope of\r\nplunder, became booty themselves, all of them being taken, and obliged\r\nto pay a ransom. The colors and carriages were also captured. This\r\nvictory was much more advantageous to the Florentines than injurious to\r\nthe duke; for, had they been conquered, Tuscany would have been his own;\r\nbut he, by his defeat, only lost the horses and accoutrements of his\r\narmy, which could be replaced without any very serious expense. Nor was\r\nthere ever an instance of wars being carried on in an enemy's country\r\nwith less injury to the assailants than at this; for in so great a\r\ndefeat, and in a battle which continued four hours, only one man died,\r\nand he, not from wounds inflicted by hostile weapons, or any honorable\r\nmeans, but, having fallen from his horse, was trampled to death.\r\nCombatants then engaged with little danger; being nearly all mounted,\r\ncovered with armor, and preserved from death whenever they chose\r\nto surrender, there was no necessity for risking their lives; while\r\nfighting, their armor defended them, and when they could resist no\r\nlonger, they yielded and were safe.\r\n\r\nThis battle, from the circumstances which attended and followed it,\r\npresents a striking example of the wretched state of military discipline\r\nin those times. The enemy's forces being defeated and driven into the\r\nBorgo, the commissaries desired to pursue them, in order to make the\r\nvictory complete, but not a single condottiere or soldier would obey,\r\nalleging, as a sufficient reason for their refusal, that they must take\r\ncare of the booty and attend to their wounded; and, what is still more\r\nsurprising, the next day, without permission from the commissaries, or\r\nthe least regard for their commanders, they went to Arezzo, and, having\r\nsecured their plunder, returned to Anghiari; a thing so contrary to\r\nmilitary order and all subordination, that the merest shadow of a\r\nregular army would easily and most justly have wrested from them\r\nthe victory they had so undeservedly obtained. Added to this, the\r\nmen-at-arms, or heavy-armed horse, who had been taken prisoners, whom\r\nthe commissaries wished to be detained that they might not rejoin the\r\nenemy, were set at liberty, contrary to their orders. It is astonishing,\r\nthat an army so constructed should have sufficient energy to obtain\r\nthe victory, or that any should be found so imbecile as to allow such a\r\ndisorderly rabble to vanquish them. The time occupied by the Florentine\r\nforces in going and returning from Arezzo, gave Niccolo opportunity of\r\nescaping from the Borgo, and proceeding toward Romagna. Along with him\r\nalso fled the Florentine exiles, who, finding no hope of their return\r\nhome, took up their abodes in various parts of Italy, each according\r\nto his own convenience. Rinaldo made choice of Ancona; and, to gain\r\nadmission to the celestial country, having lost the terrestrial, he\r\nperformed a pilgrimage to the holy sepulcher; whence having returned, he\r\ndied suddenly while at table at the celebration of the marriage of one\r\nof his daughters; an instance of fortune's favor, in removing him from\r\nthe troubles of this world upon the least sorrowful day of his exile.\r\nRinaldo d'Albizzi appeared respectable under every change of condition;\r\nand would have been more so had he lived in a united city, for many\r\nqualities were injurious to him in a factious community, which in an\r\nharmonious one would have done him honor.\r\n\r\nWhen the forces returned from Arezzo, Niccolo being then gone, the\r\ncommissaries presented themselves at the Borgo, the people of which were\r\nwilling to submit to the Florentines; but their offer was declined,\r\nand while negotiations were pending, the pope's legate imagined the\r\ncommissaries designed to take it from the church. Hard words were\r\nexchanged and hostilities might have ensued between the Florentine\r\nand ecclesiastical forces, if the misunderstanding had continued much\r\nlonger; but as it was brought to the conclusion desired by the legate,\r\npeace was restored.\r\n\r\nWhile the affair of the Borgo San Sepolcro was in progress, Niccolo\r\nPiccinino was supposed to have marched toward Rome; other accounts\r\nsaid La Marca, and hence the legate and the count's forces moved toward\r\nPerugia to relieve La Marca or Rome, as the case might be, and Bernardo\r\nde Medici accompanied them. Neri led the Florentine forces to recover\r\nthe Casentino, and pitched his camp before Rassina, which he took,\r\ntogether with Bibbiena, Prato Vecchio, and Romena. From thence he\r\nproceeded to Poppi and invested it on two sides with his forces, in one\r\ndirection toward the plain of Certomondo, in the other upon the hill\r\nextending to Fronzole. The count finding himself abandoned to his fate,\r\nhad shut himself up in Poppi, not with any hope of assistance, but with\r\na view to make the best terms he could. Neri pressing him, he offered\r\nto capitulate, and obtained reasonable conditions, namely, security for\r\nhimself and family, with leave to take whatever he could carry away, on\r\ncondition of ceding his territories and government to the Florentines.\r\nWhen he perceived the full extent of his misfortune, standing upon the\r\nbridge which crosses the Arno, close to Poppi, he turned to Neri in\r\ngreat distress, and said, \"Had I well considered my own position and\r\nthe power of the Florentines, I should now have been a friend of the\r\nrepublic and congratulating you on your victory, not an enemy compelled\r\nto supplicate some alleviation of my woe. The recent events which to you\r\nbring glory and joy, to me are full of wretchedness and sorrow. Once\r\nI possessed horses, arms, subjects, grandeur and wealth: can it be\r\nsurprising that I part with them reluctantly? But as you possess both\r\nthe power and the inclination to command the whole of Tuscany, we must\r\nof necessity obey you; and had I not committed this error, my misfortune\r\nwould not have occurred, and your liberality could not have been\r\nexercised; so, that if you were to rescue me from entire ruin, you would\r\ngive the world a lasting proof of your clemency. Therefore, let your\r\npity pass by my fault, and allow me to retain this single house to\r\nleave to the descendants of those from whom your fathers have received\r\ninnumerable benefits.\" To this Neri replied: \"That his having expected\r\ngreat results from men who were capable of doing only very little, had\r\nled him to commit so great a fault against the republic of Florence;\r\nthat, every circumstance considered, he must surrender all those places\r\nto the Florentines, as an enemy, which he was unwilling to hold as a\r\nfriend: that he had set such an example, as it would be most highly\r\nimpolitic to encourage; for, upon a change of fortune, it might injure\r\nthe republic, and it was not himself they feared, but his power while\r\nlord of the Casentino. If, however, he could live as a prince in\r\nGermany, the citizens would be very much gratified; and out of love\r\nto those ancestors of whom he had spoken, they would be glad to assist\r\nhim.\" To this, the count, in great anger, replied: \"He wished the\r\nFlorentines at a much greater distance.\" Attempting no longer to\r\npreserve the least urbanity of demeanor, he ceded the place and all\r\nits dependencies to the Florentines, and with his treasure, wife, and\r\nchildren, took his departure, mourning the loss of a territory which his\r\nforefathers had held during four hundred years. When all these victories\r\nwere known at Florence, the government and people were transported\r\nwith joy. Benedetto de' Medici, finding the report of Niccolo having\r\nproceeded either to Rome or to La Marca, incorrect, returned with his\r\nforces to Neri, and they proceeded together to Florence, where the\r\nhighest honors were decreed to them which it was customary with the city\r\nto bestow upon her victorious citizens, and they were received by the\r\nSignory, the Capitani di Parte, and the whole city, in triumphal pomp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nReflections on the object of war and the use of victory--Niccolo\r\nreinforces his army--The duke of Milan endeavors to recover the services\r\nof Count Francesco Sforza--Suspicions of the Venetians--They acquire\r\nRavenna--The Florentines purchase the Borgo San Sepolcro of the\r\npope--Piccinino makes an excursion during the winter--The count besieged\r\nin his camp before Martinengo--The insolence of Niccolo Piccinino--The\r\nduke in revenge makes peace with the league--Sforza assisted by the\r\nFlorentines.\r\n\r\nThose who make war have always and very naturally designed to enrich\r\nthemselves and impoverish the enemy; neither is victory sought or\r\nconquest desirable, except to strengthen themselves and weaken the\r\nenemy. Hence it follows, that those who are impoverished by victory or\r\ndebilitated by conquest, must either have gone beyond, or fallen short\r\nof, the end for which wars are made. A republic or a prince is enriched\r\nby the victories he obtains, when the enemy is crushed and possession\r\nis retained of the plunder and ransom. Victory is injurious when the foe\r\nescapes, or when the soldiers appropriate the booty and ransom. In such\r\na case, losses are unfortunate, and conquests still more so; for the\r\nvanquished suffers the injuries inflicted by the enemy, and the victor\r\nthose occasioned by his friends, which being less justifiable, must\r\ncause the greater pain, particularly from a consideration of his being\r\nthus compelled to oppress his people by an increased burden of taxation.\r\nA ruler possessing any degree of humanity, cannot rejoice in a victory\r\nthat afflicts his subjects. The victories of the ancient and well\r\norganized republics, enabled them to fill their treasuries with gold and\r\nsilver won from their enemies, to distribute gratuities to the people,\r\nreduce taxation, and by games and solemn festivals, disseminate\r\nuniversal joy. But the victories obtained in the times of which we\r\nspeak, first emptied the treasury, and then impoverished the people,\r\nwithout giving the victorious party security from the enemy. This arose\r\nentirely from the disorders inherent in their mode of warfare; for the\r\nvanquished soldiery, divesting themselves of their accoutrements, and\r\nbeing neither slain nor detained prisoners, only deferred a renewed\r\nattack on the conqueror, till their leader had furnished them with arms\r\nand horses. Besides this, both ransom and booty being appropriated\r\nby the troops, the victorious princes could not make use of them for\r\nraising fresh forces, but were compelled to draw the necessary means\r\nfrom their subjects' purses, and this was the only result of victory\r\nexperienced by the people, except that it diminished the ruler's\r\nreluctance to such a course, and made him less particular about his mode\r\nof oppressing them. To such a state had the practice of war been\r\nbrought by the sort of soldiery then on foot, that the victor and the\r\nvanquished, when desirous of their services, alike needed fresh supplies\r\nof money; for the one had to re-equip them, and the other to bribe\r\nthem; the vanquished could not fight without being remounted, and the\r\nconquerors would not take the field without a new gratuity. Hence it\r\nfollowed, that the one derived little advantage from the victory, and\r\nthe other was the less injured by defeat; for the routed party had to be\r\nre-equipped, and the victorious could not pursue his advantage.\r\n\r\nFrom this disorderly and perverse method of procedure, it arose, that\r\nbefore Niccolo's defeat became known throughout Italy, he had again\r\nreorganized his forces, and harassed the enemy with greater vigor than\r\nbefore. Hence, also, it happened, that after his disaster at Tenna, he\r\nso soon occupied Verona: that being deprived of his army at Verona, he\r\nwas shortly able to appear with a large force in Tuscany; that being\r\ncompletely defeated at Anghiari, before he reached Tuscany, he was more\r\npowerful in the field than ever. He was thus enabled to give the duke of\r\nMilan hopes of defending Lombardy, which by his absence appeared to\r\nbe lost; for while Niccolo spread consternation throughout Tuscany,\r\ndisasters in the former province so alarmed the duke, that he was afraid\r\nhis utter ruin would ensue before Niccolo, whom he had recalled, could\r\ncome to his relief, and check the impetuous progress of the count. Under\r\nthese impressions, the duke, to insure by policy that success which he\r\ncould not command by arms, had recourse to remedies, which on similar\r\noccasions had frequently served his turn. He sent Niccolo da Esti,\r\nprince of Ferrara, to the count who was then at Peschiera, to persuade\r\nhim, \"That this war was not to his advantage; for if the duke became\r\nso ruined as to be unable to maintain his position among the states of\r\nItaly, the count would be the first to suffer; for he would cease to be\r\nof importance either with the Venetians or the Florentines; and to\r\nprove the sincerity of his wish for peace, he offered to fulfill the\r\nengagement he had entered into with regard to his daughter, and send her\r\nto Ferrara; so that as soon as peace was established, the union might\r\ntake place.\" The count replied, \"That if the duke really wished\r\nfor peace, he might easily be gratified, as the Florentines and the\r\nVenetians were equally anxious for it. True, it was, he could with\r\ndifficulty credit him, knowing that he had never made peace but from\r\nnecessity, and when this no longer pressed him, again desired war.\r\nNeither could he give credence to what he had said concerning the\r\nmarriage, having been so repeatedly deceived; yet when peace was\r\nconcluded, he would take the advice of his friends upon that subject.\"\r\n\r\nThe Venetians, who were sometimes needlessly jealous of their soldiery,\r\nbecame greatly alarmed at these proceedings; and not without reason.\r\nThe count was aware of this, and wishing to remove their apprehensions,\r\npursued the war with unusual vigor; but his mind had become so unsettled\r\nby ambition, and the Venetians' by jealousy, that little further\r\nprogress was made during the remainder of the summer, and upon the\r\nreturn of Niccolo into Lombardy, winter having already commenced, the\r\narmies withdrew into quarters, the count to Verona, the Florentine\r\nforces to Tuscany, the duke's to Cremona, and those of the pope to\r\nRomagna. The latter, after having been victorious at Anghiari, made an\r\nunsuccessful attack upon Furli and Bologna, with a view to wrest them\r\nfrom Niccolo Piccinino; but they were gallantly defended by his son\r\nFrancesco. However, the arrival of the papal forces so alarmed the\r\npeople of Ravenna with the fear of becoming subject to the church, that,\r\nby consent of Ostasio di Polenta their lord, they placed themselves\r\nunder the power of the Venetians; who, in return for the territory, and\r\nthat Ostasio might never retake by force what he had imprudently given\r\nthem, sent him and his son to Candia, where they died. In the course of\r\nthese affairs, the pope, notwithstanding the victory at Anghiari, became\r\nso in want of money, that he sold the fortress of Borgo San Sepolcro to\r\nthe Florentines for 25,000 ducats.\r\n\r\nAffairs being thus situated, each party supposed winter would protect\r\nthem from the evils of war, and thought no more of peace. This was\r\nparticularly the case with the duke, who, being rendered doubly secure\r\nby the season and by the presence of Niccolo, broke off all attempts to\r\neffect a reconciliation with the count, reorganized Niccolo's forces,\r\nand made every requisite preparation for the future struggle. The count\r\nbeing informed of this, went to Venice to consult with the senate on the\r\ncourse to be pursued during the next year. Niccolo, on the other hand,\r\nbeing quite prepared, and seeing the enemy unprovided, did not await the\r\nreturn of spring, but crossed the Adda during severe weather, occupied\r\nthe whole Brescian territory, except Oddula and Acri, and made\r\nprisoners two thousand horse belonging to Francesco's forces, who had\r\nno apprehension of an attack. But the greatest source of anxiety to the\r\ncount, and alarm to the Venetians, was the desertion of his service by\r\nCiarpellone, one of his principal officers. Francesco, on learning these\r\nmatters, immediately left Venice, and, arriving at Brescia, found that\r\nNiccolo, after doing all the mischief he could, had retired to his\r\nquarters; and therefore, finding the war concluded for the present was\r\nnot disposed to rekindle it, but rather to use the opportunity afforded\r\nby the season and his enemies, of reorganizing his forces, so as to be\r\nable, when spring arrived, to avenge himself for his former injuries.\r\nTo this end he induced the Venetians to recall the forces they had\r\nin Tuscany, in the Florentine service, and to order that to succeed\r\nGattamelata, who was dead, Micheletto Attendulo should take the command.\r\n\r\nOn the approach of spring, Niccolo Piccinino was the first to take\r\nthe field, and encamped before Cignano, a fortress twelve miles from\r\nBrescia; the count marched to its relief, and the war between them was\r\nconducted in the usual manner. The count, apprehensive for the city of\r\nBergamo, besieged Martinengo, a castle so situated that the possession\r\nof it would enable him to relieve the former, which was closely pressed\r\nby Niccolo, who, having foreseen that the enemy could impede him only\r\nfrom the direction of Martinengo, had put the castle into a complete\r\nstate of defense, so that the count was obliged to lend his whole\r\nforce to the siege. Upon this, Niccolo placed his troops in a situation\r\ncalculated to intercept the count's provisions, and fortified himself\r\nwith trenches and bastions in such a manner that he could not be\r\nattacked without the most manifest hazard to his assailant. Hence the\r\nbesiegers were more distressed than the people of Martinengo whom they\r\nbesieged. The count could not hold his position for want of food, nor\r\nquit it without imminent danger; so that the duke's victory appeared\r\ncertain, and defeat equally inevitable to the count and the Venetians.\r\n\r\nBut fortune, never destitute of means to assist her favorites, or to\r\ninjure others, caused the hope of victory to operate so powerfully\r\nupon Niccolo Piccinino, and made him assume such a tone of unbounded\r\ninsolence, that, losing all respect for himself and the duke, he sent\r\nhim word that, having served under his ensign for so long, without\r\nobtaining sufficient land to serve him for a grave, he wished to know\r\nfrom himself what was to be the reward of his labors; for it was in his\r\npower to make him master of Lombardy, and place all his enemies in\r\nhis power; and, as a certain victory ought to be attended by a sure\r\nremuneration, he desired the duke to concede to him the city of\r\nPiacenza, that when weary with his lengthened services he might at\r\nlast betake himself to repose. Nor did he hesitate, in conclusion, to\r\nthreaten, if his request were not granted, to abandon the enterprise.\r\nThis injurious and most insolent mode of proceeding highly offended the\r\nduke, and, on further consideration, he determined rather to let the\r\nexpedition altogether fail, than consent to his general's demand. Thus,\r\nwhat all the dangers he had incurred, and the threats of his enemies,\r\ncould not draw from him, the insolent behavior of his friends made him\r\nwilling to propose. He resolved to come to terms with the count,\r\nand sent Antonio Guido Buono, of Tortona, to offer his daughter and\r\nconditions of peace, which were accepted with great pleasure by the\r\ncount, and also by the colleagues as far as themselves were concerned.\r\nThe terms being secretly arranged, the duke sent to command Niccolo\r\nto make a truce with the count for one year; intimating, that being\r\nexhausted with the expense, he could not forego a certain peace for a\r\ndoubtful victory. Niccolo was utterly astonished at this resolution,\r\nand could not imagine what had induced the duke to lose such a glorious\r\nopportunity; nor could he surmise that, to avoid rewarding his friends,\r\nhe would save his enemies, and therefore to the utmost of his power he\r\nopposed this resolution; and the duke was obliged, in order to induce\r\nhis compliance, to threaten that if he did not obey he would give him up\r\nto his soldiers and his enemies. Niccolo submitted, with the feelings\r\nof one compelled to leave country and friends, complaining of his hard\r\nfate, that fortune and the duke were robbing him of the victory over his\r\nenemies. The truce being arranged, the marriage of the duke's daughter,\r\nBianca, to the count was solemnized, the duke giving Cremona for her\r\nportion. This being over, peace was concluded in November, 1441,\r\nat which Francesco Barbadico and Pagolo Trono were present for the\r\nVenetians, and for the Florentines Agnolo Acciajuoli. Peschiera, Asola,\r\nand Lonato, castles in the Mantuan territory, were assigned to the\r\nVenetians.\r\n\r\nThe war in Lombardy was concluded; but the dissensions in the kingdom\r\nof Naples continued, and the inability to compose them occasioned the\r\nresumption of those arms which had been so recently laid aside. Alfonso,\r\nof Aragon, had, during these wars, taken from René the whole kingdom\r\nexcept Naples; so that, thinking he had the victory in his power, he\r\nresolved during the siege of Naples to take Benevento, and his other\r\npossessions in that neighborhood, from the count; and thought he might\r\neasily accomplish this while the latter was engaged in the wars of\r\nLombardy. Having heard of the conclusion of peace, Alfonso feared the\r\ncount would not only come for the purpose of recovering his territories,\r\nbut also to favor René; and René himself had hope of his assistance for\r\nthe same reason. The latter, therefore, sent to the count, begging he\r\nwould come to the relief of a friend, and avenge himself of an enemy.\r\nOn the other hand, Alfonso entreated Filippo, for the sake of the\r\nfriendship which subsisted between them, to find the count some other\r\noccupation, that, being engaged in greater affairs, he might not have\r\nan opportunity of interfering between them. Filippo complied with this\r\nrequest, without seeming to be aware that he violated the peace recently\r\nmade, so greatly to his disadvantage. He therefore signified to pope\r\nEugenius, that the present was a favorable opportunity for recovering\r\nthe territories which the count had taken from the church; and, that he\r\nmight be in a condition to use it, offered him the services of Niccolo\r\nPiccinino, and engaged to pay him during the war; who, since the peace\r\nof Lombardy, had remained with his forces in Romagna. Eugenius eagerly\r\ntook the advice, induced by his hatred of the count, and his desire to\r\nrecover his lost possessions; feeling assured that, although on a former\r\noccasion he had been duped by Niccolo, it would be improper, now that\r\nthe duke interfered, to suspect any deceit; and, joining his forces to\r\nthose of Niccolo, he assailed La Marca. The count, astonished at such an\r\nunexpected attack, assembled his troops, and went to meet the enemy. In\r\nthe meantime, King Alfonso took possession of Naples, so that the whole\r\nkingdom, except Castelnuova, was in his power. Leaving a strong guard\r\nat Castelnuova René set out and came to Florence, where he was most\r\nhonorably received; and having remained a few days, finding he could not\r\ncontinue the war, he withdrew to Marseilles.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Alfonso took Castelnuova, and the count found himself\r\nassailed in the Marca Inferiore, both by the pope and Niccolo. He\r\napplied to the Venetians and the Florentines for assistance, in men and\r\nmoney, assuring them that if they did not determine to restrain the pope\r\nand king, during his life, they would soon afterward find their very\r\nexistence endangered, for both would join Filippo and divide Italy\r\namong them. The Florentines and Venetians hesitated for a time, both to\r\nconsider the propriety of drawing upon themselves the enmity of the pope\r\nand the king, and because they were then engaged in the affairs of the\r\nBolognese. Annibale Bentivoglio had driven Francesco Piccinino from\r\nBologna, and for defense against the duke, who favored Francesco, he\r\ndemanded and received assistance of the Venetians and Florentines; so\r\nthat, being occupied with these matters they could not resolve to assist\r\nthe count, but Annibale, having routed Francesco Piccinino, and those\r\naffairs seeming to be settled, they resolved to support him. Designing\r\nhowever to make sure of the duke, they offered to renew the league with\r\nhim, to which he was not averse; for, although he consented that war\r\nshould be made against the count, while King René was in arms, yet\r\nfinding him now conquered, and deprived of the whole kingdom, he was\r\nnot willing that the count should be despoiled of his territories; and\r\ntherefore, not only consented that assistance should be given him,\r\nbut wrote to Alfonso to be good enough to retire to his kingdom, and\r\ndiscontinue hostilities against the count; and although reluctantly, yet\r\nin acknowledgment of his obligations to the duke, Alfonso determined to\r\nsatisfy him, and withdrew with his forces beyond the Tronto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDiscords of Florence--Jealousy excited against Neri di Gino\r\nCapponi--Baldaccio d'Anghiari murdered--Reform of government in favor\r\nof the Medici--Enterprises of Sforza and Piccinino--Death of Niccolo\r\nPiccinino--End of the war--Disturbances in Bologna--Annibale Bentivoglio\r\nslain by Battista Canneschi, and the latter by the people--Santi,\r\nsupposed to be the son of Ercole Bentivoglio, is called to govern\r\nthe city of Bologna--Discourse of Cosmo de' Medici to him--Perfidious\r\ndesigns of the duke of Milan against Sforza--General war in\r\nItaly--Losses of the duke of Milan--The duke has recourse to the count,\r\nwho makes peace with him--Offers of the duke and the Venetians to the\r\ncount--The Venetians furtively deprive the count of Cremona.\r\n\r\nWhile the affairs of Romagna proceeded thus, the city of Florence\r\nwas not tranquil. Among the citizens of highest reputation in the\r\ngovernment, was Neri di Gino Capponi, of whose influence Cosmo de'\r\nMedici had more apprehension than any other; for to the great authority\r\nwhich he possessed in the city was added his influence with the\r\nsoldiery. Having been often leader of the Florentine forces he had won\r\ntheir affection by his courage and talents; and the remembrance of his\r\nown and his father's victories (the latter having taken Pisa, and he\r\nhimself having overcome Niccolo Piccinino at Anghiari) caused him to\r\nbe beloved by many, and feared by those who were averse to having\r\nassociates in the government. Among the leaders of the Florentine army\r\nwas Baldaccio d'Anghiari, an excellent soldier, for in those times there\r\nwas not one in Italy who surpassed him in vigor either of body or mind;\r\nand possessing so much influence with the infantry, whose leader he had\r\nalways been, many thought they would follow him wherever he chose to\r\nlead them. Baldaccio was the intimate friend of Neri, who loved him for\r\nhis talents, of which he had been a constant witness. This excited great\r\nsuspicion in the other citizens, who, thinking it alike dangerous either\r\nto discharge or retain him in their service, determined to destroy him,\r\nand fortune seemed to favor their design. Bartolommeo Orlandini was\r\nGonfalonier of Justice; the same person who was sent to the defense of\r\nMarradi, when Niccolo Piccinino came into Tuscany, as we have related\r\nabove, and so basely abandoned the pass, which by its nature was almost\r\nimpregnable. So flagrant an instance of cowardice was very offensive\r\nto Baldaccio, who, on many occasions, both by words and letters, had\r\ncontributed to make the disgraceful fact known to all. The shame and\r\nvexation of Bartolommeo were extreme, so that of all things he wished to\r\navenge himself, thinking, with the death of his accuser, to efface the\r\nstain upon his character.\r\n\r\nThis feeling of Bartolommeo Orlandini was known to other citizens, so\r\nthat they easily persuaded him to put Baldaccio to death, and at one\r\navenge himself, and deliver his country from a man whom they must\r\neither retain at great peril, or discharge to their greater confusion.\r\nBartolommeo having therefore resolved to murder him, concealed in his\r\nown apartment at the palace several young men, all armed; and Baldaccio,\r\nentering the piazza, whither it was his daily custom to come, to confer\r\nwith the magistrates concerning his command, the Gonfalonier sent for\r\nhim, and he, without any suspicion, obeyed. Meeting him in the corridor,\r\nwhich leads to the chambers of the Signory, they took a few turns\r\ntogether discoursing of his office, when being close to the door of the\r\napartments in which the assassins were concealed, Bartolommeo gave them\r\nthe signal, upon which they rushed out, and finding Baldaccio alone and\r\nunarmed, they slew him, and threw the body out of the window which looks\r\nfrom the palace toward the dogano, or customhouse. It was thence carried\r\ninto the piazza, where the head being severed, it remained the whole day\r\nexposed to the gaze of the people. Baldaccio was married, and had only\r\none child, a boy, who survived him but a short time; and his wife,\r\nAnnalena, thus deprived of both husband and offspring, rejected every\r\nproposal for a second union. She converted her house into a monastery,\r\nto which she withdrew, and, being joined by many noble ladies, lived\r\nin holy seclusion to the end of her days. The convent she founded, and\r\nwhich is named from her, preserves her story in perpetual remembrance.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance served to weaken Neri's power, and made him lose both\r\ninfluence and friends. Nor did this satisfy the citizens who held the\r\nreins of government; for it being ten years since their acquisition of\r\npower, and the authority of the Balia expired, many began to exhibit\r\nmore boldness, both in words and deeds, than seemed consistent with\r\ntheir safety; and the leaders of the party judged, that if they wished\r\nto preserve their influence, some means must be adopted to increase it.\r\nTo this end, in 1444 the councils created a new Balia, which reformed\r\nthe government, gave authority to a limited number to create the\r\nSignory, re-established the Chancery of Reformations, depriving Filippo\r\nPeruzzi of his office of president in it, and appointing another wholly\r\nunder their influence. They prolonged the term of exile to those who\r\nwere banished; put Giovanni di Simone Vespucci in prison; deprived the\r\nAccoppiatori of their enemies of the honors of government, and with\r\nthem the sons of Piero Baroncelli, the whole of the Seragli, Bartolommeo\r\nFortini, Francesco Castellani, and many others. By these means they\r\nstrengthened their authority and influence, and humbled their enemies,\r\nor those whom they suspected of being so.\r\n\r\nHaving thus recovered and confirmed their government, they then\r\nturned their attention to external affairs. As observed above, Niccolo\r\nPiccinino was abandoned by King Alfonso, and the count having been\r\naggrandized by the assistance of the Florentines, attacked and routed\r\nhim near Fermo, where, after losing nearly the whole of his troops,\r\nNiccolo fled to Montecchio, which he fortified in such a manner that in\r\na short time he had again assembled so large an army as enabled him to\r\nmake head against the count; particularly as the season was now come for\r\nthem to withdraw into quarters. His principal endeavor during the winter\r\nwas to collect troops, and in this he was assisted both by the pope and\r\nAlfonso; so that, upon the approach of spring, both leaders took the\r\nfield, and Niccolo, being the strongest, reduced the count to extreme\r\nnecessity, and would have conquered him if the duke had not contrived to\r\nfrustrate his designs. Filippo sent to beg he would come to him with\r\nall speed, for he wished to have a personal interview, that he might\r\ncommunicate matters of the highest importance. Niccolo, anxious to hear\r\nthem, abandoned a certain victory for a very doubtful advantage; and\r\nleaving his son Francesco to command the army, hastened to Milan.\r\nThe count being informed of the circumstance, would not let slip the\r\nopportunity of fighting in the absence of Niccolo; and, coming to an\r\nengagement near the castle of Monte Loro, routed the father's forces and\r\ntook the son prisoner. Niccolo having arrived at Milan saw that the duke\r\nhad duped him, and learning the defeat of his army and the capture of\r\nhis son, he died of grief in 1445, at the age of sixty-four, having been\r\na brave rather than a fortunate leader. He left two sons, Francesco and\r\nJacopo, who, possessing less talent than their father, were still more\r\nunfortunate; so that the arms of the family became almost annihilated,\r\nwhile those of Sforza, being favored by fortune, attained augmented\r\nglory. The pope, seeing Niccolo's army defeated and himself dead, having\r\nlittle hope of assistance from Aragon, sought peace with the count, and,\r\nby the intervention of the Florentines, succeeded. Of La Marca, the pope\r\nonly retained Osimo, Fabriano, and Recanati; all the rest remained in\r\nthe count's possession.\r\n\r\nPeace being restored to La Marca, the whole of Italy would have obtained\r\nrepose had it not been disturbed by the Bolognese. There were in Bologna\r\ntwo very powerful families, the Canneschi and the Bentivogli. Of the\r\nlatter, Annibale was the head; of the former, Battista, who, as a means\r\nof confirming their mutual confidence, had contracted family alliances;\r\nbut among men who have the same objects of ambition in view, it is\r\neasy to form connections, but difficult to establish friendship. The\r\nBolognese were in a league with the Venetians and Florentines, which had\r\nbeen effected by the influence of Annibale, after they had driven\r\nout Francesco Piccinino; and Battista, knowing how earnestly the duke\r\ndesired to have the city favorable to him, proposed to assassinate\r\nAnnibale, and put Bologna into his power. This being agreed upon, on the\r\ntwenty-fifth of June, 1445, he attacked Annibale with his men, and slew\r\nhim: and then, with shouts of \"the duke, the duke,\" rode through the\r\ncity. The Venetian and Florentine commissaries were in Bologna at the\r\ntime, and at first kept themselves within doors; but finding that the\r\npeople, instead of favoring the murderers, assembled in the piazza,\r\narmed in great numbers, mourning the death of Annibale, they joined\r\nthem; and, assembling what forces they could, attacked the Canneschi,\r\nsoon overpowered them, slew part, and drove the remainder out of the\r\ncity. Battista, unable to effect his escape, or his enemies his capture,\r\ntook refuge in a vault of his house, used for storing grain. The friends\r\nof the Bentivogli, having sought him all day, and knowing he had not\r\nleft the city, so terrified his servants, that one of them, a groom,\r\ndisclosed the place of his concealment, and being drawn forth in\r\ncomplete armor he was slain, his body dragged about the streets, and\r\nafterward burned. Thus the duke's authority was sufficient to prompt the\r\nenterprise, but his force was not at hand to support it.\r\n\r\nThe tumults being settled by the death of Battista, and the flight of\r\nthe Canneschi, Bologna still remained in the greatest confusion. There\r\nnot being one of the house of Bentivogli of age to govern, Annibale\r\nhaving left but one son whose name was Giovanni, only six years old,\r\nit was apprehended that disunion would ensue among the Bentivogli,\r\nand cause the return of the Cannecshi, and the ruin both of their own\r\ncountry and party. While in this state of apprehension, Francesco,\r\nsometime Count di Poppi, being at Bologna, informed the rulers of\r\nthe city, that if they wished to be governed by one of the blood of\r\nAnnibale, he could tell them of one; and related that about twenty years\r\nago, Ercole, cousin of Annibale, being at Poppi, became acquainted with\r\na girl of the castle, of whom was born a son named Santi, whom Ercole,\r\non many occasions acknowledged to be his own, nor could he deny it,\r\nfor whoever knew him and saw the boy, could not fail to observe the\r\nstrongest resemblance. The citizens gave credit to the tale, and\r\nimmediately sent to Florence to see the young man, and procure of Cosmo\r\nand Neri permission to return with him to Bologna. The reputed father\r\nof Santi was dead, and he lived under the protection of his uncle, whose\r\nname was Antonio da Cascese. Antonio was rich, childless, and a friend\r\nof Neri, to whom the matter becoming known, he thought it ought neither\r\nto be despised nor too hastily accepted; and that it would be best\r\nfor Santi and those who had been sent from Bologna, to confer in the\r\npresence of Cosmo. They were accordingly introduced, and Santi was not\r\nmerely honored but adored by them, so greatly were they influenced by\r\nthe spirit of party. However, nothing was done at the time, except that\r\nCosmo, taking Santi apart, spoke to him thus: \"No one can better advise\r\nyou in this matter than yourself; for you have to take that course\r\nto which your own mind prompts you. If you be the son of Ercole\r\nBentivoglio, you will naturally aspire to those pursuits which are\r\nproper to your family and worthy of your father; but if you be the son\r\nof Agnolo da Cascese, you will remain in Florence, and basely spend the\r\nremainder of your days in some branch of the woolen trade.\" These words\r\ngreatly influenced the youth, who, though he had at first almost refused\r\nto adopt such a course, said, he would submit himself wholly to what\r\nCosmo and Neri should determine. They, assenting to the request of the\r\nBolognese, provided suitable apparel, horses, and servants; and in a\r\nfew days he was escorted by a numerous cavalcade to Bologna, where the\r\nguardianship of Annibale's son and of the city were placed in his hands.\r\nHe conducted himself so prudently, that although all his ancestors had\r\nbeen slain by their enemies, he lived in peace and died respected by\r\neveryone.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Niccolo Piccinino and the peace of La Marca, Filippo\r\nwishing to procure a leader of his forces, secretly negotiated with\r\nCiarpellone, one of the principal captains of Count Francesco, and\r\narrangements having been made, Ciarpellone asked permission to go to\r\nMilan to take possession of certain castles which had been given him by\r\nFilippo during the late wars. The count suspecting what was in progress,\r\nin order to prevent the duke from accommodating himself at his expense,\r\ncaused Ciarpellone to be arrested, and soon afterward put to death;\r\nalleging that he had been detected plotting against him. Filippo was\r\nhighly annoyed and indignant, which the Venetians and the Florentines\r\nwere glad to observe, for their greatest fear was, that the duke and the\r\ncount should become friends.\r\n\r\nThe duke's anger caused the renewal of war in La Marca. Gismondo\r\nMalatesti, lord of Rimino, being son-in-law of the count, expected to\r\nobtain Pesaro; but the count, having obtained possession, gave it to\r\nhis brother, Alessandro. Gismondo, offended at this, was still further\r\nexasperated at finding that Federigo di Montefeltro, his enemy, by the\r\ncount's assistance, gained possession of Urbino. He therefore joined the\r\nduke, and solicited the pope and the king to make war against the count,\r\nwho, to give Gismondo a taste of the war he so much desired, resolved to\r\ntake the initiative, and attacked him immediately. Thus Romagna and La\r\nMarca were again in complete confusion, for Filippo, the king, and the\r\npope, sent powerful assistance to Gismondo, while the Florentines and\r\nVenetians supplied the count with money, though not with men. Nor was\r\nFilippo satisfied with the war in Romagna, but also desired to take\r\nCremona and Pontremoli from the count; but Pontremoli was defended by\r\nthe Florentines, and Cremona by the Venetians. Thus the war was renewed\r\nin Lombardy, and after several engagements in the Cremonese, Francesco\r\nPiccinino, the leader of the duke's forces, was routed at Casale, by\r\nMicheletto and the Venetian troops. This victory gave the Venetians hope\r\nof obtaining the duke's dominions. They sent a commissary to Cremona,\r\nattacked the Ghiaradadda, and took the whole of it, except Crema. Then\r\ncrossing the Adda, they overran the country as far as Milan. Upon this\r\nthe duke had recourse to Alfonso, and entreated his assistance, pointing\r\nout the danger his kingdom would incur if Lombardy were to fall into\r\nthe hands of the Venetians. Alfonso promised to send him troops, but\r\napprised him of the difficulties which would attend their passage,\r\nwithout the permission of the count.\r\n\r\nFilippo, driven to extremity, then had recourse to Francesco, and begged\r\nhe would not abandon his father-in-law, now that he had become old and\r\nblind. The count was offended with the duke for making war against him;\r\nbut he was jealous of the increasing greatness of the Venetians, and\r\nhe himself began to be in want of money, for the League supplied him\r\nsparingly. The Florentines, being no longer in fear of the duke, ceased\r\nto stand in need of the count, and the Venetians desired his ruin; for\r\nthey thought Lombardy could not be taken from him except by this means;\r\nyet while Filippo sought to gain him over, and offered him the entire\r\ncommand of his forces, on condition that he should restore La Marca to\r\nthe pope and quit the Venetian alliance, ambassadors were sent to him by\r\nthat republic, promising him Milan, if they took it, and the perpetual\r\ncommand of their forces, if he would push the war in La Marca, and\r\nprevent Alfonso from sending troops into Lombardy. The offers of the\r\nVenetians were great, as also were their claims upon him, having begun\r\nthe war in order to save him from losing Cremona; while the injuries\r\nreceived from the duke were fresh in his memory, and his promises had\r\nlost all influence, still the count hesitated; for on the one hand, were\r\nto be considered his obligations to the League, his pledged faith,\r\ntheir recent services, and his hopes of the future, all which had\r\ntheir influence on him; on the other, were the entreaties of his\r\nfather-in-law, and above all, the bane which he feared would be\r\nconcealed under the specious offers of the Venetians, for he doubted\r\nnot, that both with regard to Milan and their other promises, if they\r\nwere victorious, he would be at their mercy, to which no prudent men\r\nwould ever submit if he could avoid it. These difficulties in the way\r\nof his forming a determination, were obviated by the ambition of the\r\nVenetians, who, seeing a chance of occupying Cremona, from secret\r\nintelligence with that city, under a different pretext, sent troops into\r\nits neighborhood; but the affair was discovered by those who commanded\r\nCremona for the count, and measures were adopted which prevented\r\nits success. Thus without obtaining Cremona, they lost the count's\r\nfriendship, who, now being free from all other considerations, joined\r\nthe duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDeath of Filippo Visconti, duke of Milan--The Milanese appoint Sforza\r\ntheir captain--Milan becomes a republic--The pope endeavors to restore\r\npeace to Italy--The Venetians oppose this design--Alfonso attacks the\r\nFlorentines--The neighborhood of Piombino becomes the principal\r\ntheater of war--Scarcity in the Florentine camp--Disorders occur in\r\nthe Neapolitan and Florentine armies--Alfonso sues for peace and is\r\ncompelled to retreat--Pavia surrenders to the count--Displeasure of\r\nthe Milanese--The count besieges Caravaggio--The Venetians endeavor to\r\nrelieve the place--They are routed by the count before Caravaggio.\r\n\r\nPope Eugenius being dead, was succeeded by Nicholas V. The count had his\r\nwhole army at Cotignola, ready to pass into Lombardy, when intelligence\r\nwas brought him of the death of Filippo, which happened on the last\r\nday of August, 1447. This event greatly afflicted him, for he doubted\r\nwhether his troops were in readiness, on account of their arrears of\r\npay; he feared the Venetians, who were his armed enemies, he having\r\nrecently forsaken them and taken part with the duke; he was in\r\napprehension from Alfonso, his inveterate foe; he had no hope from the\r\npontiff or the Florentines; for the latter were allies of the Venetians,\r\nand he had seized the territories of the former. However, he resolved to\r\nface his fortune and be guided by circumstances; for it often happens,\r\nthat when engaged in business valuable ideas are suggested, which in a\r\nstate of inaction would never have occurred. He had great hopes, that if\r\nthe Milanese were disposed to defend themselves against the ambition of\r\nthe Venetians, they could make use of no other power but his. Therefore,\r\nhe proceeded confidently into the Bolognese territory, thence to Modena\r\nand Reggio, halted with his forces upon the Lenza, and sent to offer his\r\nservices at Milan. On the death of the duke, part of the Milanese were\r\ninclined to establish a republic; others wished to choose a prince, and\r\nof these, one part favored the count, and another Alfonso. However, the\r\nmajority being in favor of freedom, they prevailed over the rest,\r\nand organized a republic, to which many cities of the Duchy refused\r\nobedience; for they, too, desired to live in the enjoyment of their\r\nliberty, and even those who did not embrace such views, refused to\r\nsubmit to the sovereignty of the Milanese. Lodi and Piacenza surrendered\r\nthemselves to the Venetians; Pavia and Parma became free. This confused\r\nstate of things being known to the count, he proceeded to Cremona, where\r\nhis ambassadors and those of the Milanese arranged for him to command\r\nthe forces of the new republic, with the same remuneration he had\r\nreceived from the duke at the time of his decease. To this they added\r\nthe possession of Brescia, until Verona was recovered, when he should\r\nhave that city and restore Brescia to the Milanese.\r\n\r\nBefore the duke's death, Pope Nicholas, after his assumption of the\r\npontificate, sought to restore peace among the princes of Italy, and\r\nwith this object endeavored, in conjunction with the ambassadors sent by\r\nthe Florentines to congratulate him on his accession, to appoint a diet\r\nat Ferrara to attempt either the arrangement of a long truce, or the\r\nestablishment of peace. A congress was accordingly held in that city,\r\nof the pope's legate and the Venetian, ducal, and Florentine\r\nrepresentatives. King Alfonso had no envoy there. He was at Tivoli with\r\na great body of horse and foot, and favorable to the duke; both having\r\nresolved, that having gained the count over to their side, they would\r\nopenly attack the Florentines and Venetians, and till the arrival of\r\nthe count in Lombardy, take part in the treaty for peace at Ferrara, at\r\nwhich, though the king did not appear, he engaged to concur in whatever\r\ncourse the duke should adopt. The conference lasted several days, and\r\nafter many debates, resolved on either a truce for five years, or a\r\npermanent peace, whichsoever the duke should approve; and the ducal\r\nambassadors, having returned to Milan to learn his decision, found him\r\ndead. Notwithstanding this, the Milanese were disposed to adopt the\r\nresolutions of the assembly, but the Venetians refused, indulging\r\ngreat hopes of becoming masters of Lombardy, particularly as Lodi and\r\nPiacenza, immediately after the duke's death, had submitted to them.\r\nThey trusted that either by force or by treaty they could strip Milan\r\nof her power; and then so press her, as to compel her also to surrender\r\nbefore any assistance could arrive; and they were the more confident of\r\nthis from seeing the Florentines involved in war with King Alfonso.\r\n\r\nThe king being at Tivoli, and designing to pursue his enterprise against\r\nTuscany, as had been arranged between himself and Filippo, judging\r\nthat the war now commenced in Lombardy would give him both time and\r\nopportunity, and wishing to have a footing in the Florentine state\r\nbefore he openly commenced hostilities, opened a secret understanding\r\nwith the fortress of Cennina, in the Val d'Arno Superiore, and took\r\npossession of it. The Florentines, surprised with this unexpected event,\r\nperceiving the king already in action, and resolved to do them all\r\nthe injury in his power, hired forces, created a council of ten for\r\nmanagement of the war, and prepared for the conflict in their usual\r\nmanner. The king was already in the Siennese, and used his utmost\r\nendeavors to reduce the city, but the inhabitants of Sienna were firm in\r\ntheir attachment to the Florentines, and refused to receive him within\r\ntheir walls or into any of their territories. They furnished him with\r\nprovisions, alleging in excuse, the enemy's power and their inability\r\nto resist. The king, finding he could not enter by the Val d'Arno, as he\r\nhad first intended, both because Cennina had been already retaken, and\r\nbecause the Florentines were now in some measure prepared for their\r\ndefense, turned toward Volterra, and occupied many fortresses in that\r\nterritory. Thence he proceeded toward Pisa, and with the assistance of\r\nFazio and Arrigo de' Conti, of the Gherardesca, took some castles, and\r\nissuing from them, assailed Campiglia, but could not take it, the place\r\nbeing defended by the Florentines, and it being now in the depth of\r\nwinter. Upon this the king, leaving garrisons in the places he had taken\r\nto harass the surrounding country, withdrew with the remainder of his\r\narmy to quarters in the Siennese. The Florentines, aided by the season,\r\nused the most active exertions to provide themselves troops, whose\r\ncaptains were Federigo, lord of Urbino, and Gismondo Malatesti da\r\nRimino, who, though mutual foes, were kept so united by the prudence\r\nof the commissaries, Neri di Gino and Bernardetto de' Medici, that they\r\nbroke up their quarters while the weather was still very severe and\r\nrecovered not only the places that had been taken in the territory of\r\nPisa, but also the Pomerancie in the neighborhood of Volterra, and so\r\nchecked the king's troops, which at first had overrun the Maremma, that\r\nthey could scarcely retain the places they had been left to garrison.\r\n\r\nUpon the return of the spring the commissaries halted with their whole\r\nforce, consisting of five thousand horse and two thousand foot, at the\r\nSpedaletto. The king approached with his army, amounting to fifteen\r\nthousand men, within three miles of Campiglia, but when it was expected\r\nhe would attack the place he fell upon Piombino, hoping, as it was\r\ninsufficiently provided, to take it with very little trouble, and thus\r\nacquire a very important position, the loss of which would be severely\r\nfelt by the Florentines; for from it he would be able to exhaust them\r\nwith a long war, obtain his own provision by sea, and harass the whole\r\nterritory of Pisa. They were greatly alarmed at this attack, and,\r\nconsidering that if they could remain with their army among the woods\r\nof Campiglia, the king would be compelled to retire either in defeat\r\nor disgrace. With this view they equipped four galleys at Livorno, and\r\nhaving succeeded in throwing three hundred infantry into Piombino,\r\ntook up their own position at the Caldane, a place where it would be\r\ndifficult to attack them; and they thought it would be dangerous to\r\nencamp among the thickets of the plain.\r\n\r\nThe Florentine army depended for provisions on the surrounding places,\r\nwhich, being poor and thinly inhabited, had difficulty in supplying\r\nthem. Consequently the troops suffered, particularly from want of wine,\r\nfor none being produced in that vicinity, and unable to procure it from\r\nmore distant places, it was impossible to obtain a sufficient quantity.\r\nBut the king, though closely pressed by the Florentines, was well\r\nprovided except in forage, for he obtained everything else by sea. The\r\nFlorentines, desirous to supply themselves in the same manner, loaded\r\nfour vessels with provisions, but, upon their approach, they were\r\nattacked by seven of the king's galleys, which took two of them and\r\nput the rest to flight. This disaster made them despair of procuring\r\nprovisions, so that two hundred men of a foraging party, principally for\r\nwant of wine, deserted to the king, and the rest complained that\r\nthey could not live without it, in a situation where the heat was so\r\nexcessive and the water bad. The commissaries therefore determined\r\nto quit the place, and endeavor to recover those castles which still\r\nremained in the enemy's power; who, on his part, though not suffering\r\nfrom want of provisions, and greatly superior in numbers, found his\r\nenterprise a failure, from the ravages made in his army by those\r\ndiseases which the hot season produces in marshy localities; and which\r\nprevailed to such an extent that many died daily, and nearly all were\r\naffected. These circumstances occasioned overtures of peace. The king\r\ndemanded fifty thousand florins, and the possession of Piombino. When\r\nthe terms were under consideration, many citizens, desirous of peace,\r\nwould have accepted them, declaring there was no hope of bringing to a\r\nfavorable conclusion a war which required so much money to carry it on.\r\nBut Neri Capponi going to Florence, placed the matter in a more correct\r\nlight, and it was then unanimously determined to reject the proposal,\r\nand take the lord of Piombino under their protection, with an alliance\r\noffensive and defensive, provided he did not abandon them, but assist in\r\ntheir defense as hitherto. The king being informed of this resolution,\r\nsaw that, with his reduced army, he could not gain the place, and\r\nwithdrew in the same condition as if completely routed, leaving behind\r\nhim two thousand dead. With the remainder of his sick troops he retired\r\nto the Siennese territory, and thence to his kingdom, incensed against\r\nthe Florentines, and threatening them with new wars upon the return of\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were proceeding in Tuscany the Count Sforza, having\r\nbecome leader of the Milanese forces, strenuously endeavored to secure\r\nthe friendship of Francesco Piccinino, who was also in their service,\r\nthat he might support him in his enterprises, or be less disposed to do\r\nhim injury. He then took the field with his army, upon which the people\r\nof Pavia, conscious of their inability to resist him, and unwilling to\r\nobey the Milanese, offered to submit themselves to his authority, on\r\ncondition that he should not subject them to the power of Milan. The\r\ncount desired the possession of Pavia, and considered the circumstance\r\na happy omen, as it would enable him to give a color to his designs. He\r\nwas not restrained from treachery either by fear or shame; for great men\r\nconsider failure disgraceful,--a fraudulent success the contrary. But\r\nhe was apprehensive that his possession of the city would excite the\r\nanimosity of the Milanese, and perhaps induce them to throw themselves\r\nunder the power of the Venetians. If he refused to accept the offer,\r\nhe would have occasion to fear the duke of Savoy, to whom many citizens\r\nwere inclined to submit themselves; and either alternative would deprive\r\nhim of the sovereignty of Lombardy. Concluding there was less danger in\r\ntaking possession of the city than in allowing another to have it, he\r\ndetermined to accept the proposal of the people of Pavia, trusting he\r\nwould be able to satisfy the Milanese, to whom he pointed out the danger\r\nthey must have incurred had he not complied with it; for her citizens\r\nwould have surrendered themselves to the Venetians or to the duke of\r\nSavoy; so that in either case they would have been deprived of the\r\ngovernment, and therefore they ought to be more willing to have himself\r\nas their neighbor and friend, than a hostile power such as either of the\r\nothers, and their enemy. The Milanese were upon this occasion greatly\r\nperplexed, imagining they had discovered the count's ambition, and\r\nthe end he had in view; but they thought it desirable to conceal their\r\nfears, for they did not know, if the count were to desert them, to whom\r\nthey could have recourse except the Venetians, whose pride and tyranny\r\nthey naturally dreaded. They therefore resolved not to break with the\r\ncount, but by his assistance remedy the evils with which they were\r\nthreatened, hoping that when freed from them they might rescue\r\nthemselves from him also; for at that time they were assailed not only\r\nby the Venetians but by the Genoese and the duke of Savoy, in the name\r\nof Charles of Orleans, the son of a sister of Filippo, but whom the\r\ncount easily vanquished. Thus their only remaining enemies were the\r\nVenetians, who, with a powerful army, determined to occupy their\r\nterritories, and had already taken possession of Lodi and Piacenza,\r\nbefore which latter place the count encamped; and, after a long siege,\r\ntook and pillaged the city. Winter being set in, he led his forces into\r\nquarters, and then withdrew to Cremona, where, during the cold season,\r\nhe remained in repose with his wife.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, the Venetian and Milanese armies again took the field. It\r\nwas the design of the Milanese, first to recover Lodi and then to come\r\nto terms with the Venetians; for the expenses of the war had become very\r\ngreat, and they were doubtful of their general's sincerity, so that they\r\nwere anxious alike for the repose of peace, and for security against the\r\ncount. They therefore resolved that the army should march to the siege\r\nof Carravaggio, hoping that Lodi would surrender, on that fortress being\r\nwrested from the enemy's hands. The count obeyed, though he would have\r\npreferred crossing the Adda and attacking the Brescian territory. Having\r\nencamped before Caravaggio, he so strongly entrenched himself, that if\r\nthe enemy attempted to relieve the place, they would have to attack\r\nhim at a great disadvantage. The Venetian army, led by Micheletto,\r\napproached within two bowshots of the enemy's camp, and many skirmishes\r\nensued. The count continued to press the fortress, and reduced it to the\r\nvery last extremity, which greatly distressed the Venetians, since they\r\nknew the loss of it would involve the total failure of their expedition.\r\nVery different views were entertained by their military officers\r\nrespecting the best mode of relieving the place, but they saw no\r\ncourse open except to attack the enemy in his trenches, in spite of\r\nall obstacles. The castle was, however, considered of such paramount\r\nimportance, that the Venetian senate, though naturally timid, and averse\r\nto all hazardous undertakings, chose rather to risk everything than\r\nallow it to fall into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThey therefore resolved to attack the count at all events, and early\r\nthe next morning commenced their assault upon a point which was least\r\ndefended. At the first charge, as commonly happens in a surprise,\r\nFrancesco's whole army was thrown into dismay. Order, however, was\r\nsoon so completely restored by the count, that the enemy, after various\r\nefforts to gain the outworks, were repulsed and put to flight; and so\r\nentirely routed, that of twelve thousand horse only one thousand escaped\r\nthe hands of the Milanese, who took possession of all the carriages\r\nand military stores; nor had the Venetians ever before suffered such a\r\nthorough rout and overthrow. Among the plunder and prisoners, crouching\r\ndown, as if to escape observation, was found a Venetian commissary, who,\r\nin the course of the war and before the fight, had spoken contemptuously\r\nof the count, calling him \"bastard,\" and \"base-born.\" Being made\r\nprisoner, he remembered his faults, and fearing punishment, being taken\r\nbefore the count, was agonized with terror; and, as is usual with\r\nmean minds (in prosperity insolent, in adversity abject and cringing),\r\nprostrated himself, weeping and begging pardon for the offenses he\r\nhad committed. The count, taking him by the arm, raised him up, and\r\nencouraged him to hope for the best. He then said he wondered how a\r\nman so prudent and respectable as himself, could so far err as to\r\nspeak disparagingly of those who did not merit it; and as regarded the\r\ninsinuations which he had made against him, he really did not know how\r\nSforza his father, and Madonna Lucia his mother, had proceeded together,\r\nnot having been there, and having no opportunity of interfering in the\r\nmatter, so that he was not liable either to blame or praise. However,\r\nhe knew very well, that in regard to his own actions he had conducted\r\nhimself so that no one could blame him; and in proof of this he would\r\nrefer both the Venetian senate and himself to what had happened that\r\nday. He then advised him in future to be more respectful in speaking of\r\nothers, and more cautious in regard to his own proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe count's successes--The Venetians come to terms with him--Views of\r\nthe Venetians--Indignation of the Milanese against the count--Their\r\nambassador's address to him--The count's moderation and reply--The count\r\nand the Milanese prepare for war--Milanese ambassadors at Venice--League\r\nof the Venetians and Milanese--The count dupes the Venetians and\r\nMilanese--He applies for assistance to the Florentines--Diversity of\r\nopinions in Florence on the subject--Neri di Gino Capponi averse to\r\nassisting the count--Cosmo de' Medici disposed to do so--The Florentines\r\nsent ambassadors to the count.\r\n\r\nAfter this victory, the count marched into the Brescian territory,\r\noccupied the whole country, and then pitched his camp within two miles\r\nof the city. The Venetians, having well-grounded fears that Brescia\r\nwould be next attacked, provided the best defense in their power. They\r\nthen collected the relics of their army, and, by virtue of the treaty,\r\ndemanded assistance of the Florentines; who, being relieved from the\r\nwar with Alfonso, sent them one thousand foot and two thousand horse, by\r\nwhose aid the Venetians were in a condition to treat for peace. At one\r\ntime it seemed the fate of their republic to lose by war and win by\r\nnegotiation; for what was taken from them in battle was frequently\r\nrestored twofold on the restoration of peace. They knew the Milanese\r\nwere jealous of the count, and that he wished to be not their captain\r\nmerely, but their sovereign; and as it was in their power to make peace\r\nwith either of the two (the one desiring it from ambition, the other\r\nfrom fear), they determined to make choice of the count, and offer him\r\nassistance to effect his design; persuading themselves, that as the\r\nMilanese would perceive they had been duped by him, they would in\r\nrevenge place themselves in the power of any one rather than in his; and\r\nthat, becoming unable either to defend themselves or trust the count,\r\nthey would be compelled, having no other resource, to fall into their\r\nhands. Having taken this resolution, they sounded the count, and found\r\nhim quite disposed for peace, evidently desirous that the honor and\r\nadvantage of the victory at Caravaggio should be his own, and not accrue\r\nto the Milanese. The parties therefore entered into an agreement, in\r\nwhich the Venetians undertook to pay the count thirteen thousand florins\r\nper month, till he should obtain Milan, and to furnish him, during the\r\ncontinuance of the war, four thousand horse and two thousand foot. The\r\ncount engaged to restore to the Venetians the towns, prisoners, and\r\nwhatever else had been taken by him during the late campaigns, and\r\ncontent himself with those territories which the duke possessed at the\r\ntime of his death.\r\n\r\nWhen this treaty became known at Milan, it grieved the citizens more\r\nthan the victory at Caravaggio had exhilarated them. The rulers of the\r\ncity mourned, the people complained, women and children wept, and all\r\nexclaimed against the count as false and perfidious. Although they\r\ncould not hope that either prayers or promises would divert him from his\r\nungrateful design, they sent ambassadors to see with what kind of color\r\nhe would invest his unprincipled proceedings, and being admitted to his\r\npresence, one of them spoke to the following effect;--\"It is customary\r\nwith those who wish to obtain a favor, to make use either of prayers,\r\npresents, or threats, that pity, convenience, or fear, may induce a\r\ncompliance with their requests. But as with cruel, avaricious, or, in\r\ntheir own conceit, powerful men, these arguments have no weight, it is\r\nvain to hope, either to soften them by prayers, win them by presents, or\r\nalarm them by menaces. We, therefore, being now, though late, aware of\r\nthy pride, cruelty, and ambition, come hither, not to ask aught, nor\r\nwith the hope, even if we were so disposed, of obtaining it, but to\r\nremind thee of the benefits thou hast received from the people of Milan,\r\nand to prove with what heartless ingratitude thou hast repaid them,\r\nthat at least, under the many evils oppressing us, we may derive some\r\ngratification from telling thee how and by whom they have been produced.\r\nThou canst not have forgotten thy wretched condition at the death of the\r\nduke Filippo; the king and the pope were both thine enemies; thou hadst\r\nabandoned the Florentines and the Venetians, who, on account of their\r\njust indignation, and because they stood in no further need of thee,\r\nwere almost become thy declared enemies. Thou wert exhausted by thy\r\nwars against the church; with few followers, no friends, or any money;\r\nhopeless of being able to preserve either thy territories or thy\r\nreputation. From these circumstances thy ruin must have ensued, but for\r\nour simplicity; we received thee to our home, actuated by reverence for\r\nthe happy memory of our duke, with whom, being connected by marriage and\r\nrenewed alliance, we believed thy affection would descend to those\r\nwho had inherited his authority, and that, if to the benefits he had\r\nconferred on thee, our own were added, the friendship we sought to\r\nestablish would not only be firm, but inseparable; with this impression,\r\nwe added Verona or Brescia to thy previous appointments. What more could\r\nwe either give or promise thee? What else couldst thou, not from\r\nus merely, but from any others, have either had or expected? Thou\r\nreceivedst from us an unhoped-for benefit, and we, in return, an\r\nunmerited wrong. Neither hast thou deferred until now the manifestation\r\nof thy base designs; for no sooner wert thou appointed to command our\r\narmies, than, contrary to every dictate of propriety, thou didst accept\r\nPavia, which plainly showed what was to be the result of thy friendship;\r\nbut we bore with the injury, in hope that the greatness of the advantage\r\nwould satisfy thy ambition. Alas! those who grasp at all cannot be\r\nsatisfied with a part. Thou didst promise that we should possess the\r\nconquests which thou might afterward make; for thou wert well aware that\r\nwhat was given at many times might be withdrawn at once, as was the case\r\nafter the victory at Caravaggio, purchased by our money and blood, and\r\nfollowed by our ruin. Oh! unhappy states, which have to guard against\r\ntheir oppressor; but much more wretched those who have to trust to\r\nmercenary and faithless arms like thine! May our example instruct\r\nposterity, since that of Thebes and Philip of Macedon, who, after\r\nvictory over her enemies, from being her captain became her foe and her\r\nprince, could not avail us.\r\n\r\n\"The only fault of which we are conscious is our over-weening confidence\r\nin one whom we ought not to have trusted; for thy past life, thy\r\nrestless mind, incapable of repose, ought to have put us on our guard;\r\nneither ought we to have confided in one who betrayed the lord of Lucca,\r\nset a fine upon the Florentines and the Venetians, defied the duke,\r\ndespised the king, and besides all this, persecuted the church of God,\r\nand the Divinity himself with innumerable atrocities. We ought not to\r\nhave fancied that so many potentates possessed less influence over the\r\nmind of Francesco Sforza, than the Milanese; or that he would preserve\r\nunblemished that faith towards us which he had on so many occasions\r\nbroken with them. Still this want of caution in us does not excuse the\r\nperfidy in thee; nor can it obliterate the infamy with which our just\r\ncomplaints will blacken thy character throughout the world, or prevent\r\nthe remorse of thy conscience, when our arms are used for our own\r\ndestruction; for thou wilt see that the sufferings due to parricides are\r\nfully deserved by thee. And though ambition should blind thine eyes, the\r\nwhole world, witness to thine iniquity, will compel thee to open them;\r\nGod himself will unclose them, if perjuries, if violated faith, if\r\ntreacheries displease him, and if, as ever, he is still the enemy of the\r\nwicked. Do not, therefore, promise thyself any certainty of victory; for\r\nthe just wrath of the Almighty will weigh heavily upon thee; and we are\r\nresolved to lose our liberty only with our lives; but if we found we\r\ncould not ultimately defend it, we would submit ourselves to anyone\r\nrather than to thee. And if our sins be so great that in spite of\r\nour utmost resolution, we should still fall into thy hands, be quite\r\nassured, that the sovereignty which is commenced in deceit and villainy,\r\nwill terminate either in thyself or thy children with ignominy and\r\nblood.\"\r\n\r\nThe count, though not insensible to the just reproaches of the Milanese,\r\ndid not exhibit either by words or gestures any unusual excitement, and\r\nreplied, that \"He willingly attributed to their angry feelings all the\r\nserious charges of their indiscreet harangue; and he would reply to\r\nthem in detail, were he in the presence of anyone who could decide\r\ntheir differences; for it would be evident that he had not injured the\r\nMilanese, but only taken care that they should not injure him. They\r\nwell knew how they had proceeded after the victory of Caravaggio; for,\r\ninstead of rewarding him with either Verona or Brescia, they sought\r\npeace with the Venetians, that all the blame of the quarrel might rest\r\non him, themselves obtaining the fruit of victory, the credit of peace,\r\nand all the advantages that could be derived from the war. It would\r\nthus be manifest they had no right to complain, when he had effected\r\nthe arrangements which they first attempted to make; and that if he had\r\ndeferred to do so a little longer, he would have had reason to accuse\r\nthem of the ingratitude with which they were now charging him. Whether\r\nthe charge were true or false, that God, whom they had invoked to avenge\r\ntheir injuries, would show at the conclusion of the war, and would\r\ndemonstrate which was most his friend, and who had most justice on their\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the departure of the ambassadors, the count determined to attack\r\nthe Milanese, who prepared for their defense, and appointed Francesco\r\nand Jacopo Piccinino (attached to their cause, on account of the ancient\r\nfeud of the families of Braccio and Sforza) to conduct their forces in\r\nsupport of liberty; at least till they could deprive the count of\r\nthe aid of the Venetians, who they did not think would long be either\r\nfriendly or faithful to him. On the other hand, the count, perfectly\r\naware of this, thought it not imprudent, supposing the obligation of\r\nthe treaty insufficient, to bind them by the ties of interest; and,\r\ntherefore, in assigning to each their portion of the enterprise, he\r\nconsented that the Venetians should attack Crema, and himself, with the\r\nother forces, assail the remainder of the territory. The advantage of\r\nthis arrangement kept the Venetians so long in alliance with the count,\r\nthat he was enabled to conquer the whole of the Milanese territory, and\r\nto press the city so closely, that the inhabitants could not provide\r\nthemselves with necessaries; despairing of success, they sent envoys to\r\nthe Venetians to beg they would compassionate their distress, and, as\r\nought to be the case between republics, assist them in defense of their\r\nliberty against a tyrant, whom, if once master of their city, they would\r\nbe unable to restrain; neither did they think he would be content with\r\nthe boundaries assigned him by the treaty, but would expect all the\r\ndependencies of Milan.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians had not yet taken Crema, and wishing before they changed\r\nsides, to effect this point, they PUBLICLY answered the envoys, that\r\ntheir engagements with the count prevented them from defending the\r\nMilanese; but SECRETLY, gave them every assurance of their wish to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThe count had approached so near Milan with his forces, that he was\r\ndisputing the suburbs with the inhabitants, when the Venetians having\r\ntaken Crema, thought they need no longer hesitate to declare in favor of\r\nthe Milanese, with whom they made peace and entered into alliance; among\r\nthe terms of which was the defense of their liberty unimpaired. Having\r\ncome to this agreement, they ordered their forces to withdraw from the\r\ncount's camp and to return to the Venetian territory. They informed\r\nhim of the peace made with the Milanese, and gave him twenty days to\r\nconsider what course he would adopt. He was not surprised at the step\r\ntaken by the Venetians, for he had long foreseen it, and expected its\r\noccurrence daily; but when it actually took place, he could not\r\navoid feeling regret and displeasure similar to what the Milanese had\r\nexperienced when he abandoned them. He took two days to consider the\r\nreply he would make to the ambassadors whom the Venetians had sent to\r\ninform him of the treaty, and during this time he determined to dupe the\r\nVenetians, and not abandon his enterprise; therefore, appearing openly\r\nto accept the proposal for peace, he sent his ambassadors to Venice with\r\nfull credentials to effect the ratification, but gave them secret orders\r\nnot to do so, and with pretexts or caviling to put it off. To give the\r\nVenetians greater assurance of his sincerity, he made a truce with the\r\nMilanese for a month, withdrew from Milan and divided his forces among\r\nthe places he had taken. This course was the occasion of his victory and\r\nthe ruin of the Milanese; for the Venetians, confident of peace, were\r\nslow in preparing for war, and the Milanese finding the truce concluded,\r\nthe enemy withdrawn, and the Venetians their friends, felt assured that\r\nthe count had determined to abandon his design. This idea injured them\r\nin two ways: one, by neglecting to provide for their defense; the next,\r\nthat, being seed-time, they sowed a large quantity of grain in the\r\ncountry which the enemy had evacuated, and thus brought famine upon\r\nthemselves. On the other hand, all that was injurious to his enemies\r\nfavored the count, and the time gave him opportunity to take breath and\r\nprovide himself with assistance.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines during the war of Lombardy had not declared in favor of\r\neither party, or assisted the count either in defense of the Milanese or\r\nsince; for he never having been in need had not pressingly requested\r\nit; and they only sent assistance to the Venetians after the rout at\r\nCaravaggio, in pursuance of the treaty. Count Francesco, standing now\r\nalone, and not knowing to whom else he could apply, was compelled to\r\nrequest immediate aid of the Florentines, publicly from the state, and\r\nprivately from friends, particularly from Cosmo de' Medici, with whom he\r\nhad always maintained a steady friendship, and by whom he had constantly\r\nbeen faithfully advised and liberally supported. Nor did Cosmo abandon\r\nhim in his extreme necessity, but supplied him generously from his own\r\nresources, and encouraged him to prosecute his design. He also wished\r\nthe city publicly to assist him, but there were difficulties in the way.\r\nNeri di Gino Capponi, one of the most powerful citizens of Florence,\r\nthought it not to the advantage of the city, that the count should\r\nobtain Milan; and was of opinion that it would be more to the safety\r\nof Italy for him to ratify the peace than pursue the war. In the first\r\nplace, he apprehended that the Milanese, through their anger against the\r\ncount, would surrender themselves entirely to the Venetians, which would\r\noccasion the ruin of all. Supposing he should occupy Milan, it appeared\r\nto him that so great military superiority, combined with such an extent\r\nof territory, would be dangerous to themselves, and that if as count\r\nhe was intolerable, he would become doubly so as duke. He therefore\r\nconsidered it better for the republic of Florence and for Italy, that\r\nthe count should be content with his military reputation, and that\r\nLombardy should be divided into two republics, which could never be\r\nunited to injure others, and separately are unable to do so. To attain\r\nthis he saw no better means than to refrain from aiding the count, and\r\ncontinuing in the former league with the Venetians. These reasonings\r\nwere not satisfactory to Cosmo's friends, for they imagined that Neri\r\nhad argued thus, not from a conviction of its advantage to the republic,\r\nbut to prevent the count, as a friend of Cosmo, from becoming duke,\r\napprehending that Cosmo would, in consequence of this, become too\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\nCosmo, in reply, pointed out, that to lend assistance to the count would\r\nbe highly beneficial both to Italy and the republic; for it was unwise\r\nto imagine the Milanese could preserve their own liberty; for the nature\r\nof their community, their mode of life, and their hereditary feuds were\r\nopposed to every kind of civil government, so that it was necessary,\r\neither that the count should become duke of Milan, or the Venetians her\r\nlords. And surely under such circumstances, no one could doubt which\r\nwould be most to their advantage, to have for their neighbor a powerful\r\nfriend or a far more powerful foe. Neither need it be apprehended\r\nthat the Milanese, while at war with the count, would submit to the\r\nVenetians; for the count had a stronger party in the city, and\r\nthe Venetians had not, so that whenever they were unable to defend\r\nthemselves as freemen, they would be more inclined to obey the count\r\nthan the Venetians.\r\n\r\nThese diverse views kept the city long in suspense; but at length it\r\nwas resolved to send ambassadors to the count to settle the terms of\r\nagreement, with instructions, that if they found him in such a condition\r\nas to give hopes of his ultimate success, they were to close with him,\r\nbut, if otherwise, they were to draw out the time in diplomacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nProsecution of the war between the count and the Milanese--The Milanese\r\nreduced to extremity--The people rise against the magistrates--Milan\r\nsurrenders to the count--League between the new duke of Milan and the\r\nFlorentines, and between the king of Naples and the Venetians--Venetian\r\nand Neapolitan ambassadors at Florence--Answer of Cosmo de' Medici to\r\nthe Venetian ambassador--Preparations of the Venetians and the king\r\nof Naples for the war--The Venetians excite disturbances in\r\nBologna--Florence prepares for war--The emperor, Frederick III.\r\nat Florence--War in Lombardy between the duke of Milan and the\r\nVenetians--Ferrando, son of the king of Naples, marches into Tuscany\r\nagainst the Florentines.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors were at Reggio when they heard that the count had become\r\nlord of Milan; for as soon as the truce had expired, he approached the\r\ncity with his forces, hoping quickly to get possession of it in spite\r\nof the Venetians, who could bring no relief except from the side of\r\nthe Adda, which route he could easily obstruct, and therefore had no\r\napprehension (being then winter) of their arrival, and he trusted that,\r\nbefore the return of spring, he would be victorious, particularly, as\r\nby the death of Francesco Piccinino, there remained only Jacopo his\r\nbrother, to command the Milanese. The Venetians had sent an ambassador\r\nto Milan to confirm the citizens in their resolution of defense,\r\npromising them powerful and immediate aid. During the winter a few\r\nslight skirmishes had taken place between the count and the Venetians;\r\nbut on the approach of milder weather, the latter, under Pandolfo\r\nMalatesti, halted with their army upon the Adda, and considering\r\nwhether, in order to succor the Milanese, they ought to risk a battle,\r\nPardolfo, their general, aware of the count's abilities, and the courage\r\nof his army, said it would be unadvisable to do so, and that, under the\r\ncircumstances, it was needless, for the count, being in great want of\r\nforage, could not keep the field, and must soon retire. He therefore\r\nadvised them to remain encamped, to keep the Milanese in hope, and\r\nprevent them from surrendering. This advice was approved by the\r\nVenetians, both as being safe, and because, by keeping the Milanese in\r\nthis necessity, they might be the sooner compelled to submit to their\r\ndominion; for they felt quite sure that the injuries they had received\r\nwould always prevent their submission to the count.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Milanese were reduced to the utmost misery; and as\r\nthe city usually abounded with poor, many died of hunger in the streets;\r\nhence arose complaints and disturbances in several parts, which alarmed\r\nthe magistrates, and compelled them to use their utmost exertions to\r\nprevent popular meetings. The multitude are always slow to resolve on\r\ncommotion; but the resolution once formed, any trivial circumstance\r\nexcites it to action. Two men in humble life, talking together near the\r\nPorta Nuova of the calamities of the city, their own misery, and the\r\nmeans that might be adopted for their relief, others beginning to\r\ncongregate, there was soon collected a large crowd; in consequence of\r\nit a report was spread that the neighborhood of Porta Nuova had risen\r\nagainst the government. Upon this, all the lower orders, who only waited\r\nfor an example, assembled in arms, and chose Gasparre da Vicomercato to\r\nbe their leader. They then proceeded to the place where the magistrates\r\nwere assembled, and attacked them so impetuously that all who did not\r\nescape by flight were slain: among the number, as being considered a\r\nprincipal cause of the famine, and gratified at their distress, fell\r\nLionardo Veniero, the Venetian ambassador. Having thus almost become\r\nmasters of the city, they considered what course was next to be adopted\r\nto escape from the horrors surrounding them, and to procure peace. A\r\nfeeling universally prevailed, that as they could not preserve their own\r\nliberty, they ought to submit to a prince who could defend them. Some\r\nproposed King Alfonso, some the duke of Savoy, and others the king\r\nof France, but none mentioned the count, so great was the general\r\nindignation against him. However, disagreeing with the rest, Gasparre da\r\nVicomercato proposed him, and explained in detail that if they desired\r\nrelief from war, no other plan was open, since the people of Milan\r\nrequired a certain and immediate peace, and not a distant hope\r\nof succor. He apologized for the count's proceedings, accused the\r\nVenetians, and all the powers of Italy, of which some from ambition and\r\nothers from avarice were averse to their possessing freedom. Having to\r\ndispose of their liberty, it would be preferable, he said, to obey one\r\nwho knew and could defend them; so that, by their servitude they might\r\nobtain peace, and not bring upon themselves greater evils and more\r\ndangerous wars. He was listened to with the most profound attention;\r\nand, having concluded his harangue, it was unanimously resolved by the\r\nassembly, that the count should be called in, and Gasparre was appointed\r\nto wait upon him and signify their desire. By the people's command he\r\nconveyed the pleasing and happy intelligence to the count, who heard\r\nit with the utmost satisfaction, and entered Milan as prince on the\r\ntwenty-sixth of February, 1450, where he was received with the greatest\r\npossible joy by those who, only a short time previously had heaped on\r\nhim all the slanders that hatred could inspire.\r\n\r\nThe news of this event reaching Florence, orders were immediately sent\r\nto the envoys who were upon the way to Milan, that instead of treating\r\nfor his alliance with the count, they should congratulate the duke\r\nupon his victory; they, arranging accordingly, had a most honorable\r\nreception, and were treated with all possible respect; for the duke\r\nwell knew that in all Italy he could not find braver or more faithful\r\nfriends, to defend him against the power of the Venetians, than the\r\nFlorentines, who, being no longer in fear of the house of Visconti,\r\nfound themselves opposed by the Aragonese and Venetians; for the\r\nAragonese princes of Naples were jealous of the friendship which\r\nthe Florentines had always evinced for the family of France; and the\r\nVenetians seeing the ancient enmity of the Florentines against the\r\nVisconti transferred to themselves, resolved to injure them as much\r\nas possible; for they knew how pertinaciously and invariably they had\r\npersecuted the Lombard princes. These considerations caused the new duke\r\nwillingly to join the Florentines, and united the Venetians and King\r\nAlfonso against their common enemies; impelling them at the same time to\r\nhostilities, the king against the Florentines, and the Venetians against\r\nthe duke, who, being fresh in the government, would, they imagined, be\r\nunable to resist them, even with all the aid he could obtain.\r\n\r\nBut as the league between the Florentines and the Venetians still\r\ncontinued, and as the king, after the war of Piombino, had made peace\r\nwith the former, it seemed indecent to commence an open rupture until\r\nsome plausible reason could be assigned in justification of offensive\r\nmeasures. On this account each sent ambassadors to Florence, who, on the\r\npart of their sovereigns, signified that the league formed between them\r\nwas made not for injury to any, but solely for the mutual defense\r\nof their states. The Venetian ambassador then complained that the\r\nFlorentines had allowed Alessandro, the duke's brother, to pass into\r\nLombardy with his forces; and besides this, had assisted and advised\r\nin the treaty made between the duke and the marquis of Mantua, matters\r\nwhich he declared to be injurious to the Venetians, and inconsistent\r\nwith the friendship hitherto subsisting between the two governments;\r\namicably reminding them, that one who inflicts unmerited injury, gives\r\nothers just ground of hostility, and that those who break a peace may\r\nexpect war. The Signory appointed Cosmo de' Medici to reply to what had\r\nbeen said by the Venetian ambassador, and in a long and excellent\r\nspeech he recounted the numerous advantages conferred by the city on the\r\nVenetian republic; showed what an extent of dominion they had acquired\r\nby the money, forces, and counsel of the Florentines, and reminded him\r\nthat, although the friendship had originated with the Florentines, they\r\nhad never given occasion of enmity; and as they desired peace, they\r\ngreatly rejoiced when the treaty was made, if it had been entered into\r\nfor the sake of peace, and not of war. True it was, he wondered much\r\nat the remarks which had been made, seeing that such light and trivial\r\nmatters should give offense to so great a republic; but if they were\r\nworthy of notice he must have it universally understood, that the\r\nFlorentines wished their country to be free and open to all; and that\r\nthe duke's character was such, that if he desired the friendship of\r\nthe marquis of Mantua, he had no need of anyone's favor or advice. He\r\ntherefore feared that these cavils were produced by some latent motive,\r\nwhich it was not thought proper to disclose. Be this as it might,\r\nthey would freely declare to all, that in the same proportion as the\r\nfriendship of the Florentines was beneficial their enmity could be\r\ndestructive.\r\n\r\nThe matter was hushed up; and the ambassadors, on their departure,\r\nappeared perfectly satisfied. But the league between the king and the\r\nVenetians made the Florentines and the duke rather apprehend war than\r\nhope for a long continuance of peace. They therefore entered into an\r\nalliance, and at the same time the enmity of the Venetians transpired by\r\na treaty with the Siennese, and the expulsion of all Florentine subjects\r\nfrom their cities and territories. Shortly after this, Alfonso did the\r\nsame, without any consideration of the peace made the year previous, and\r\nnot having even the shadow of an excuse. The Venetians attempted to\r\ntake Bologna, and having armed the emigrants, and united to them a\r\nconsiderable force, introduced them into the city by night through one\r\nof the common sewers. No sooner had they entered, than they raised a\r\ncry, by which Santi Bentivogli, being awakened, was told that the whole\r\ncity was in possession of the rebels. But though many advised him\r\nto escape, saying that he could not save the city by his stay, he\r\ndetermined to confront the danger, and taking arms encouraged his\r\nfollowers, assembled a few friends, attacked and routed part of the\r\nrebels, slew many more, and drove the remainder out of the city. By this\r\nact of bravery all agreed he had fully proved himself a genuine scion of\r\nthe house of the Bentivogli.\r\n\r\nThese events and demonstrations gave the Florentines an earnest of\r\napproaching war; they consequently followed their usual practice on\r\nsimilar occasions, and created the Council of Ten. They engaged new\r\ncondottieri, sent ambassadors to Rome, Naples, Venice, Milan, and\r\nSienna, to demand assistance from their friends, gain information about\r\nthose they suspected, decide such as were wavering, and discover the\r\ndesigns of the foe. From the pope they obtained only general expressions\r\nof an amicable disposition and admonitions to peace; from the king,\r\nempty excuses for having expelled the Florentines, and offers of safe\r\nconduct for whoever should demand it; and although he endeavored, as\r\nmuch as possible, to conceal every indication of his hostile designs,\r\nthe ambassadors felt convinced of his unfriendly disposition, and\r\nobserved many preparations tending to the injury of the republic. The\r\nLeague with the duke was strengthened by mutual obligations, and through\r\nhis means they became friends with the Genoese, the old differences with\r\nthem respecting reprisals, and other small matters of dispute, being\r\ncomposed, although the Venetians used every possible means to prevent\r\nit, and entreated the emperor of Constantinople to expel all Florentines\r\nfrom his dominions; so fierce was the animosity with which they entered\r\non this war, and so powerful their lust of dominion, that without the\r\nleast hesitation they sought the destruction of those who had been the\r\noccasion of their own power. The emperor, however, refused to listen to\r\nthem. The Venetian senate forbade the Florentine ambassadors to enter\r\ntheir territories, alleging, that being in league with the king, they\r\ncould not entertain them without his concurrence. The Siennese received\r\nthe ambassadors with fair words, fearing their own ruin before the\r\nLeague could assist them, and therefore endeavored to appease the powers\r\nwhose attack they were unable to resist. The Venetians and the king (as\r\nwas then conjectured) were disposed to send ambassadors to Florence to\r\njustify the war. But the Venetian envoy was not allowed to enter the\r\nFlorentine dominions, and the king's ambassador, being unwilling to\r\nperform his office alone, the embassy was not completed; and thus\r\nthe Venetians learned, that however little they might esteem the\r\nFlorentines, the latter had still less respect for them.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these fears, the emperor, Frederick III., came into\r\nItaly to be crowned. On the thirtieth of January, 1451, he entered\r\nFlorence with fifteen hundred horse, and was most honorably received\r\nby the Signory. He remained in the city till the sixth of February, and\r\nthen proceeded to Rome for his coronation, where, having been solemnly\r\nconsecrated, and his marriage celebrated with the empress, who had\r\ncome to Rome by sea, he returned to Germany, and again passed through\r\nFlorence in May, with the same honors as upon his arrival. On his\r\nreturn, having derived some benefits from the marquis of Mantua, he\r\nconceded to him Modena and Reggio. In the meantime, the Florentines did\r\nnot fail to prepare themselves for immediate war; and to augment their\r\ninfluence, and strike the enemy with terror, they, in conjunction with\r\nthe duke, entered into alliance with the king of France for the mutual\r\ndefense of their states. This treaty was published with great pomp\r\nthroughout all Italy.\r\n\r\nThe month of May, 1452, having arrived, the Venetians thought it not\r\ndesirable to defer any longer their attack upon the duke, and with\r\nsixteen thousand horse and six thousand foot assailed his territories\r\nin the direction of Lodi, while the marquis of Montferrat, instigated\r\neither by his own ambition or the entreaties of the Venetians, did the\r\nsame on the side of Alexandria. The duke assembled a force of eighteen\r\nthousand cavalry and three thousand infantry, garrisoned Alexandria and\r\nLodi, and all the other places where the enemy might annoy them. He then\r\nattacked the Brescian territory, and greatly harassed the Venetians;\r\nwhile both parties alike plundered the country and ravaged the smaller\r\ntowns. Having defeated the marquis of Montferrat at Alexandria, the duke\r\nwas able to unite his whole force against the Venetians and invade their\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nWhile the war in Lombardy proceeded thus, giving rise to various\r\ntrifling incidents unworthy of recital, King Alfonso and the Florentines\r\ncarried on hostilities in Tuscany, but in a similarly inefficient\r\nmanner, evincing no greater talent, and incurring no greater danger.\r\nFerrando, the illegitimate son of Alfonso, entered the country with\r\ntwelve thousand troops, under the command of Federigo, lord of Urbino.\r\nTheir first attempt was to attack Fojano, in the Val di Chiane;\r\nfor, having the Siennese in their favor, they entered the Florentine\r\nterritory in that direction. The walls of the castle were weak, and it\r\nwas small, and consequently poorly manned, but the garrison were, among\r\nthe soldiers of that period, considered brave and faithful. Two hundred\r\ninfantry were also sent by the Signory for its defense. Before this\r\ncastle, thus provided, Ferrando sat down, and either from the valor of\r\nits defenders or his own deficiencies, thirty-six days elapsed before\r\nhe took it. This interval enabled the city to make better provision\r\nfor places of greater importance, to collect forces and conclude more\r\neffective arrangements than had hitherto been made. The enemy next\r\nproceeded into the district of Chiane, where they attacked two small\r\ntowns, the property of private citizens, but could not capture them.\r\nThey then encamped before the Castellina, a fortress upon the borders\r\nof the Chianti, within ten miles of Sienna, weak from its defective\r\nconstruction, and still more so by its situation; but, notwithstanding\r\nthese defects, the assailants were compelled to retire in disgrace,\r\nafter having lain before it forty-four days. So formidable were those\r\narmies, and so perilous those wars, that places now abandoned as\r\nuntenable were then defended as impregnable.\r\n\r\nWhile Ferrando was encamped in the Chianti he made many incursions, and\r\ntook considerable booty from the Florentine territories, extending his\r\ndepredations within six miles of the city, to the great alarm and injury\r\nof the people, who at this time, having sent their forces to the\r\nnumber of eight thousand soldiers under Astorre da Faenza and Gismondo\r\nMalatesti toward Castel di Colle, kept them at a distance from the\r\nenemy, lest they should be compelled to an engagement; for they\r\nconsidered that so long as they were not beaten in a pitched battle,\r\nthey could not be vanquished in the war generally; for small castles,\r\nwhen lost, were recovered at the peace, and larger places were in no\r\ndanger, because the enemy would not venture to attack them. The king\r\nhad also a fleet of about twenty vessels, comprising galleys and smaller\r\ncraft, which lay off Pisa, and during the siege of Castellina were\r\nmoored near the Rocca di Vada, which, from the negligence of the\r\ngovernor, he took, and then harassed the surrounding country. However,\r\nthis annoyance was easily removed by a few soldiers sent by the\r\nFlorentines to Campiglia, and who confined the enemy to the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nConspiracy of Stefano Porcari against the papal government--The\r\nconspirators discovered and punished--The Florentines recover the places\r\nthey had lost--Gherardo Gambacorti, lord of Val di Bagno, endeavors\r\nto transfer his territories to the king of Naples--Gallant conduct of\r\nAntonio Gualandi, who counteracts the design of Gambacorti--René\r\nof Anjou is called into Italy by the Florentines--René returns to\r\nFrance--The pope endeavors to restore peace--Peace proclaimed--Jacopo\r\nPiccinino attacks the Siennese.\r\n\r\nThe pontiff did not interfere in these affairs further than to endeavor\r\nto bring the parties to a mutual accommodation; but while he refrained\r\nfrom external wars he incurred the danger of more serious troubles at\r\nhome. Stefano Porcari was a Roman citizen, equally distinguished\r\nfor nobility of birth and extent of learning, but still more by the\r\nexcellence of his character. Like all who are in pursuit of glory, he\r\nresolved either to perform or to attempt something worthy of memory, and\r\nthought he could not do better than deliver his country from the hands\r\nof the prelates, and restore the ancient form of government; hoping, in\r\nthe event of success, to be considered a new founder or second father of\r\nthe city. The dissolute manners of the priesthood, and the discontent\r\nof the Roman barons and people, encouraged him to look for a happy\r\ntermination of his enterprise; but he derived his greatest confidence\r\nfrom those verses of Petrarch in the canzone which begins, \"Spirto\r\ngentil che quelle membra reggi,\" where he says,--\r\n\r\n\"Sopra il Monte Tarpejo canzon vedra, Un cavalier, ch' Italia tutta\r\nonora, Pensoso piu d'altrui, che di se stesso.\"\r\n\r\nStefano, believing poets are sometimes endowed with a divine and\r\nprophetic spirit, thought the event must take place which Petrarch in\r\nthis canzone seemed to foretell, and that he was destined to effect the\r\nglorious task; considering himself in learning, eloquence, friends, and\r\ninfluence, superior to any other citizen of Rome. Having taken these\r\nimpressions, he had not sufficient prudence to avoid discovering his\r\ndesign by his discourse, demeanor, and mode of living; so that the pope\r\nbecoming acquainted with it, in order to prevent the commission of some\r\nrash act, banished him to Bologna and charged the governor of the city\r\nto compel his appearance before him once every day. Stefano was\r\nnot daunted by this first check, but with even greater earnestness\r\nprosecuted his undertaking, and, by such means as were available, more\r\ncautiously corresponded with his friends, and often went and returned\r\nfrom Rome with such celerity as to be in time to present himself\r\nbefore the governor within the limit allowed for his appearance. Having\r\nacquired a sufficient number of partisans, he determined to make the\r\nattempt without further delay, and arranged with his friends at Rome to\r\nprovide an evening banquet, to which all the conspirators were invited,\r\nwith orders that each should bring with him his most trust-worthy\r\nfriends, and himself promised to be with him before the entertainment\r\nwas served. Everything was done according to this orders, and Stefano\r\nPorcari arrived at the place appointed. Supper being brought in, he\r\nentered the apartment dressed in cloth of gold, with rich ornaments\r\nabout his neck, to give him a dignified appearance and commanding\r\naspect. Having embraced the company, he delivered a long oration to\r\ndispose their minds to the glorious undertaking. He then arranged the\r\nmeasures to be adopted, ordering that one part of them should, on the\r\nfollowing morning, take possession of the pontiff's palace, and that\r\nthe other should call the people of Rome to arms. The affair came to the\r\nknowledge of the pope the same night, some say by treachery among the\r\nconspirators, and others that he knew of Porcari's presence at Rome. Be\r\nthis as it may, on the night of the supper Stefano, and the greater part\r\nof his associates, were arrested, and afterward expiated their crime\r\nby death. Thus ended his enterprise; and though some may applaud his\r\nintentions, he must stand charged with deficiency of understanding; for\r\nsuch undertakings, though possessing some slight appearance of glory,\r\nare almost always attended with ruin.\r\n\r\nGherardo Gambacorti was lord of Val di Bagno, and his ancestors as well\r\nas himself had always been in the pay or under the protection of the\r\nFlorentines. Alfonso endeavored to induce him to exchange his territory\r\nfor another in the kingdom of Naples. This became known to the\r\nSignory, who, in order to ascertain his designs, sent an ambassador\r\nto Gambacorti, to remind him of the obligations of his ancestors and\r\nhimself to their republic, and induce him to continue faithful to them.\r\nGherardo affected the greatest astonishment, assured the ambassador with\r\nsolemn oaths that no such treacherous thought had ever entered his mind,\r\nand that he would gladly go to Florence and pledge himself for the truth\r\nof his assertions; but being unable, from indisposition, he would send\r\nhis son as an hostage. These assurances, and the proposal with which\r\nthey were accompanied, induced the Florentines to think Gherardo had\r\nbeen slandered, and that his accuser must be alike weak and treacherous.\r\nGherardo, however, hastened his negotiation with redoubled zeal, and\r\nhaving arranged the terms, Alfonso sent Frate Puccio, a knight of\r\nJerusalem, with a strong body of men to the Val di Bagno, to take\r\npossession of the fortresses and towns, the people of which, being\r\nattached to the Florentine republic, submitted unwillingly.\r\n\r\nFrate Puccio had already taken possession of nearly the whole territory,\r\nexcept the fortress of Corzano. Gambacorti was accompanied, while\r\ntransferring his dominions, by a young Pisan of great courage and\r\naddress, named Antonio Gualandi, who, considering the whole affair, the\r\nstrength of the place, the well known bravery of the garrison, their\r\nevident reluctance to give it up, and the baseness of Gambacorti,\r\nat once resolved to make an effort to prevent the fulfillment of\r\nhis design; and Gherardo being at the entrance, for the purpose of\r\nintroducing the Aragonese, he pushed him out with both his hands, and\r\ncommanded the guards to shut the gate upon such a scoundrel, and hold\r\nthe fortress for the Florentine republic. When this circumstance became\r\nknown in Bagno and the neighboring places, the inhabitants took up arms\r\nagainst the king's forces, and, raising the Florentine standard, drove\r\nthem out. The Florentines learning these events, imprisoned Gherardo's\r\nson, and sent troops to Bagno for the defense of the territory, which\r\nhaving hitherto been governed by its own prince, now became a vicariate.\r\nThe traitor Gherardo escaped with difficulty, leaving his wife, family,\r\nand all his property, in the hands of those whom he had endeavored\r\nto betray. This affair was considered by the Florentines of great\r\nimportance; for had the king succeeded in securing the territory, he\r\nmight have overrun the Val di Tavere and the Casentino at his pleasure,\r\nand would have caused so much annoyance, that they could no longer have\r\nallowed their whole force to act against the army of the Aragonese at\r\nSienna.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the preparations made by the Florentines in Italy to\r\nresist the hostile League, they sent as ambassador, Agnolo Acciajuoli,\r\nto request that the king of France would allow René of Anjou to enter\r\nItaly in favor of the duke and themselves, and also, that by his\r\npresence in the country, he might defend his friends and attempt the\r\nrecovery of the kingdom of Naples; for which purpose they offered him\r\nassistance in men and money. While the war was proceeding in Lombardy\r\nand Tuscany, the ambassador effected an arrangement with King René,\r\nwho promised to come into Italy during the month of June, the League\r\nengaging to pay him thirty thousand florins upon his arrival at\r\nAlexandria, and ten thousand per month during the continuance of the\r\nwar. In pursuance of this treaty, King René commenced his march\r\ninto Italy, but was stopped by the duke of Savoy and the marquis of\r\nMontferrat, who, being in alliance with the Venetians, would not allow\r\nhim to pass. The Florentine ambassador advised, that in order to uphold\r\nthe influence of his friends, he should return to Provence, and conduct\r\npart of his forces into Italy by sea, and, in the meantime, endeavor,\r\nby the authority of the king of France, to obtain a passage for the\r\nremainder through the territories of the duke. This plan was completely\r\nsuccessful; for René came into Italy by sea, and his forces, by the\r\nmediation of the king of France, were allowed a passage through Savoy.\r\nKing René was most honorably received by Duke Francesco, and joining his\r\nFrench with the Italian forces, they attacked the Venetians with so much\r\nimpetuosity, that they shortly recovered all the places which had been\r\ntaken in the Cremonese. Not content with this, they occupied nearly\r\nthe whole Brescian territory; so that the Venetians, unable to keep the\r\nfield, withdrew close to the walls of Brescia.\r\n\r\nWinter coming on, the duke deemed it advisable to retire into quarters,\r\nand appointed Piacenza for the forces of René, where, having passed the\r\nwhole of the cold season of 1453, without attempting anything, the duke\r\nthought of taking the field, on the approach of spring, and stripping\r\nthe Venetians of the remainder of their possessions by land, but was\r\ninformed by the king that he was obliged of necessity to return to\r\nFrance. This determination was quite new and unexpected to the duke,\r\nand caused him the utmost concern; but though he immediately went to\r\ndissuade René from carrying it into effect, he was unable either by\r\npromises or entreaties to divert him from his purpose. He engaged,\r\nhowever, to leave part of his forces, and send his son for the service\r\nof the League. The Florentines were not displeased at this; for having\r\nrecovered their territories and castles, they were no longer in fear of\r\nAlfonso, and on the other hand, they did not wish the duke to obtain any\r\npart of Lombardy but what belonged to him. René took his departure,\r\nand send his son John into Italy, according to his promise, who did not\r\nremain in Lombardy, but came direct to Florence, where he was received\r\nwith the highest respect.\r\n\r\nThe king's departure made the duke desirous of peace. The Venetians,\r\nAlfonso, and the Florentines, being all weary of the war, were similarly\r\ndisposed; and the pope continued to wish it as much as ever; for during\r\nthis year the Turkish emperor, Mohammed, had taken Constantinople and\r\nsubdued the whole of Greece. This conquest alarmed the Christians, more\r\nespecially the Venetians and the pope, who already began to fancy\r\nthe Mohammedans at their doors. The pope therefore begged the Italian\r\npotentates to send ambassadors to himself, with authority to negotiate\r\na general peace, with which all complied; but when the particular\r\ncircumstances of each case came to be considered, many difficulties were\r\nfound in the war of effecting it. King Alfonso required the Florentines\r\nto reimburse the expenses he had incurred in the war, and the\r\nFlorentines demanded some compensation from him. The Venetians thought\r\nthemselves entitled to Cremona from the duke; while he insisted upon the\r\nrestoration of Bergamo, Brescia, and Crema; so that it seemed impossible\r\nto reconcile such conflicting claims. But what could not be effected\r\nby a number at Rome was easily managed at Milan and Venice by two;\r\nfor while the matter was under discussion at Rome, the duke and the\r\nVenetians came to an arrangement on the ninth of April, 1454, by virtue\r\nof which, each party resumed what they possessed before the war, the\r\nduke being allowed to recover from the princes of Montferrat and Savoy\r\nthe places they had taken. To the other Italian powers a month was\r\nallowed to ratify the treaty. The pope and the Florentines, and with\r\nthem the Siennese and other minor powers, acceded to it within the time.\r\nBesides this, the Florentines, the Venetians, and the duke concluded\r\na treaty of peace for twenty-five years. King Alfonso alone exhibited\r\ndissatisfaction at what had taken place, thinking he had not been\r\nsufficiently considered, that he stood, not on the footing of a\r\nprincipal, but only ranked as an auxiliary, and therefore kept aloof,\r\nand would not disclose his intentions. However, after receiving a legate\r\nfrom the pope, and many solemn embassies from other powers, he allowed\r\nhimself to be persuaded, principally by means of the pontiff, and with\r\nhis son joined the League for thirty years. The duke and the king also\r\ncontracted a twofold relationship and double marriage, each giving a\r\ndaughter to a son of the other. Notwithstanding this, that Italy might\r\nstill retain the seeds of war, Alfonso would not consent to the peace,\r\nunless the League would allow him, without injury to themselves, to make\r\nwar upon the Genoese, Gismondo Malatesti, and Astorre, prince of Faenza.\r\nThis being conceded, his son Ferrando, who was at Sienna, returned to\r\nthe kingdom, having by his coming into Tuscany acquired no dominion and\r\nlost a great number of his men.\r\n\r\nUpon the establishment of a general peace, the only apprehension\r\nentertained was, that it would be disturbed by the animosity of Alfonso\r\nagainst the Genoese; yet it happened otherwise. The king, indeed, did\r\nnot openly infringe the peace, but it was frequently broken by the\r\nambition of the mercenary troops. The Venetians, as usual on the\r\nconclusion of a war, had discharged Jacopo Piccinino, who with some\r\nother unemployed condottieri, marched into Romagna, thence into the\r\nSiennese, and halting in the country, took possession of many places.\r\nAt the commencement of these disturbances, and the beginning of the year\r\n1455, Pope Nicholas died, and was succeeded by Calixtus III., who, to\r\nput a stop to the war newly broken out so near home, immediately sent\r\nGiovanni Ventimiglia, his general, with what forces he could furnish.\r\nThese being joined by the troops of the Florentines and the duke of\r\nMilan, both of whom furnished assistance, attacked Jacopo, near Bolsena,\r\nand though Ventimiglia was taken prisoner, yet Jacopo was worsted, and\r\nretreated in disorder to Castiglione della Pescaia, where, had he\r\nnot been assisted by Alfonso, his force would have been completely\r\nannihilated. This made it evident that Jacopo's movement had been\r\nmade by order of Alfonso, and the latter, as if palpably detected, to\r\nconciliate his allies, after having almost alienated them with this\r\nunimportant war, ordered Jacopo to restore to the Siennese the places he\r\nhad taken, and they gave him twenty thousand florins by way of ransom,\r\nafter which he and his forces were received into the kingdom of Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nChristendom alarmed by the progress of the Turks--The Turks routed\r\nbefore Belgrade--Description of a remarkable hurricane--War against\r\nthe Genoese and Gismondo Malatesti--Genoa submits to the king\r\nof France--Death of Alfonso king of Naples--Succeeded by his son\r\nFerrando--The pope designs to give the kingdom of Naples to his nephew\r\nPiero Lodovico Borgia--Eulogy of Pius II.--Disturbances in Genoa between\r\nJohn of Anjou and the Fregosi--The Fregosi subdued--John attacks\r\nthe kingdom of Naples--Ferrando king of Naples routed--Ferrando\r\nreinstated--The Genoese cast off the French yoke--John of Anjou routed\r\nin the kingdom of Naples.\r\n\r\nThe pope, though anxious to restrain Jacopo Piccinino, did not neglect\r\nto make provision for the defense of Christendom, which seemed in danger\r\nfrom the Turks. He sent ambassadors and preachers into every Christian\r\ncountry, to exhort princes and people to arm in defense of their\r\nreligion, and with their persons and property to contribute to the\r\nenterprise against the common enemy. In Florence, large sums were\r\nraised, and many citizens bore the mark of a red cross upon their dress\r\nto intimate their readiness to become soldiers of the faith. Solemn\r\nprocessions were made, and nothing was neglected either in public or\r\nprivate, to show their willingness to be among the most forward to\r\nassist the enterprise with money, counsel, or men. But the eagerness\r\nfor this crusade was somewhat abated, by learning that the Turkish army,\r\nbeing at the siege of Belgrade, a strong city and fortress in Hungary,\r\nupon the banks of the Danube, had been routed and the emperor wounded;\r\nso that the alarm felt by the pope and all Christendom, on the loss\r\nof Constantinople, having ceased to operate, they proceeded with\r\ndeliberately with their preparations for war; and in Hungary their\r\nzeal was cooled through the death of Giovanni Corvini the Waiwode, who\r\ncommanded the Hungarian forces on that memorable occasion, and fell in\r\nthe battle.\r\n\r\nTo return to the affairs of Italy. In the year 1456, the disturbances\r\noccasioned by Jacopo Piccinino having subsided, and human weapons\r\nlaid aside, the heavens seemed to make war against the earth; dreadful\r\ntempestuous winds then occurring, which produced effects unprecedented\r\nin Tuscany, and which to posterity will appear marvelous and\r\nunaccountable. On the twenty-fourth of August, about an hour before\r\ndaybreak, there arose from the Adriatic near Ancona, a whirlwind, which\r\ncrossing from east to west, again reached the sea near Pisa, accompanied\r\nby thick clouds, and the most intense and impenetrable darkness,\r\ncovering a breadth of about two miles in the direction of its course.\r\nUnder some natural or supernatural influence, this vast and overcharged\r\nvolume of condensed vapor burst; its fragments contended with\r\nindescribable fury, and huge bodies sometimes ascending toward heaven,\r\nand sometimes precipitated upon the earth, struggled, as it were,\r\nin mutual conflict, whirling in circles with intense velocity, and\r\naccompanied by winds, impetuous beyond all conception; while flashes of\r\nawful brilliancy, and murky, lurid flames incessantly broke forth.\r\nFrom these confused clouds, furious winds, and momentary fires, sounds\r\nissued, of which no earthquake or thunder ever heard could afford the\r\nleast idea; striking such awe into all, that it was thought the end\r\nof the world had arrived, that the earth, waters, heavens, and entire\r\nuniverse, mingling together, were being resolved into their ancient\r\nchaos. Wherever this awful tempest passed, it produced unprecedented and\r\nmarvelous effects; but these were more especially experienced near the\r\ncastle of St. Casciano, about eight miles from Florence, upon the hill\r\nwhich separates the valleys of Pisa and Grieve. Between this castle and\r\nthe Borgo St. Andrea, upon the same hill, the tempest passed without\r\ntouching the latter, and in the former, only threw down some of the\r\nbattlements and the chimneys of a few houses; but in the space between\r\nthem, it leveled many buildings quite to the ground. The roofs of the\r\nchurches of St. Martin, at Bagnolo, and Santa Maria della Pace, were\r\ncarried more than a mile, unbroken as when upon their respective\r\nedifices. A muleteer and his beasts were driven from the road into the\r\nadjoining valley, and found dead. All the large oaks and lofty trees\r\nwhich could not bend beneath its influence, were not only stripped of\r\ntheir branches but borne to a great distance from the places where\r\nthey grew, and when the tempest had passed over and daylight made the\r\ndesolation visible, the inhabitants were transfixed with dismay. The\r\ncountry had lost all its habitable character; churches and dwellings\r\nwere laid in heaps; nothing was heard but the lamentations of those\r\nwhose possessions had perished, or whose cattle or friends were buried\r\nbeneath the ruins; and all who witnessed the scene were filled with\r\nanguish or compassion. It was doubtless the design of the Omnipotent,\r\nrather to threaten Tuscany than to chastise her; for had the hurricane\r\nbeen directed over the city, filled with houses and inhabitants,\r\ninstead of proceeding among oaks and elms, or small and thinly scattered\r\ndwellings, it would have been such a scourge as the mind, with all its\r\nideas of horror, could not have conceived. But the Almighty desired\r\nthat this slight example should suffice to recall the minds of men to a\r\nknowledge of himself and of his power.\r\n\r\nTo return to our history. King Alfonso was dissatisfied with the peace,\r\nand as the war which he had unnecessarily caused Jacopo Piccinino to\r\nmake against the Siennese, had produced no important result, he resolved\r\nto try what could be done against those whom the conditions of the\r\nLeague permitted him to attack. He therefore, in the year 1456, assailed\r\nthe Genoese, both by sea and by land, designing to deprive the Fregosi\r\nof the government and restore the Adorni. At the same time, he ordered\r\nJacopo Piccinino to cross the Tronto, and attack Gismondo Malatesti,\r\nwho, having fortified his territories, did not concern himself, and this\r\npart of the king's enterprise produced no effect; but his proceedings\r\nagainst Genoa occasioned more wars against himself and his kingdom than\r\nhe could have wished. Piero Fregoso was then doge of Genoa, and doubting\r\nhis ability to sustain the attack of the king, he determined to give\r\nwhat he could not hold, to some one who might defend it against his\r\nenemies, in hope, that at a future period, he should obtain a return for\r\nthe benefit conferred. He therefore sent ambassadors to Charles VII. of\r\nFrance, and offered him the government of Genoa. Charles accepted the\r\noffer, and sent John of Anjou, the son of King René, who had a short\r\ntime previously left Florence and returned to France, to take possession\r\nwith the idea, that he, having learned the manners and customs of Italy,\r\nwould be able to govern the city; and also that this might give him an\r\nopportunity of undertaking the conquest of Naples, of which René, John's\r\nfather, had been deprived by Alfonso. John, therefore, proceeded to\r\nGenoa, where he was received as prince, and the fortresses, both of the\r\ncity and the government, given up to him. This annoyed Alfonso, with the\r\nfear that he had brought upon himself too powerful an enemy. He was not,\r\nhowever, dismayed; but pursued his enterprise vigorously, and had led\r\nhis fleet to Porto, below Villamarina, when he died after a sudden\r\nillness, and thus John and the Genoese were relieved from the war.\r\nFerrando, who succeeded to the kingdom of his father Alfonso, became\r\nalarmed at having so powerful an enemy in Italy, and was doubtful of\r\nthe disposition of many of his barons, who being desirous of change, he\r\nfeared would take part with the French. He was also apprehensive of\r\nthe pope, whose ambition he well knew, and who seeing him new in the\r\ngovernment, might design to take it from him. He had no hope except\r\nfrom the duke of Milan, who entertained no less anxiety concerning the\r\naffairs of the kingdom than Ferrando; for he feared that if the French\r\nwere to obtain it, they would endeavor to annex his own dominions; which\r\nhe knew they considered to be rightfully their own. He, therefore, soon\r\nafter the death of Alfonso, sent letters and forces to Ferrando; the\r\nlatter to give him aid and influence, the former to encourage him with\r\nan intimation that he would not, under any circumstances, forsake him.\r\nThe pontiff intended, after the death of Alfonso, to give the kingdom\r\nof Naples to his nephew Piero Lodovico Borgia, and, to furnish a decent\r\npretext for his design and obtain the concurrence of the powers of Italy\r\nin its favor he signified a wish to restore that realm to the dominion\r\nof the church of Rome; and therefore persuaded the duke not to assist\r\nFerrando. But in the midst of these views and opening enterprises,\r\nCalixtus died, and Pius II. of Siennese origin, of the family of the\r\nPiccolomini, and by name Æneas, succeeded to the pontificate. This\r\npontiff, free from the ties of private interest, having no object but to\r\nbenefit Christendom and honor the church, at the duke's entreaty crowned\r\nFerrando king of Naples; judging it easier to establish peace if the\r\nkingdom remained in the hands which at present held it, than if he were\r\nto favor the views of the French, or, as Calixtus purposed, take it for\r\nhimself. Ferrando, in acknowledgment of the benefit, created Antonio,\r\none of the pope's nephews, prince of Malfi, gave him an illegitimate\r\ndaughter of his own in marriage, and restored Benevento and Terracina to\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\nIt thus appeared that the internal dissensions of Italy might be\r\nquelled, and the pontiff prepared to induce the powers of Christendom\r\nto unite in an enterprise against the Turks (as Calixtus had previously\r\ndesigned) when differences arose between the Fregosi and John of Anjou,\r\nthe lord of Genoa, which occasioned greater and more important wars than\r\nthose recently concluded. Pietrino Fregoso was at his castle of Riviera,\r\nand thought he had not been rewarded by John in proportion to his\r\nfamily's merits; for it was by their means the latter had become prince\r\nof the city. This impression drove the parties into open enmity; a\r\ncircumstance gratifying to Ferrando, who saw in it relief from his\r\ntroubles, and the sole means of procuring his safety: he therefore\r\nassisted Pietrino with money and men, trusting to drive John out of the\r\nGenoese territory. The latter being aware of his design, sent for aid\r\nto France; and, on obtaining it, attacked Pietrino, who, through his\r\nnumerous friends, entertained the strongest assurance of success; so\r\nthat John was compelled to keep within the city, into which Pietrino\r\nhaving entered by night, took possession of some parts of it; but upon\r\nthe return of day, his people were all either slain or made prisoners by\r\nJohn's troops, and he himself was found among the dead.\r\n\r\nThis victory gave John hopes of recovering the kingdom; and in October,\r\n1459, he sailed thither from Genoa, with a powerful fleet, and landed\r\nat Baia; whence he proceeded to Sessa, by the duke of which place he was\r\nfavorably received. The prince of Taranto, the Aquilani, with several\r\ncities and other princes, also joined him; so that a great part of the\r\nkingdom fell into his hands. On this Ferrando applied for assistance\r\nto the pope and the duke of Milan; and, to diminish the number of his\r\nenemies, made peace with Gismondo Malatesti, which gave so much offense\r\nto Jacopo Piccinino, the hereditary enemy of Gismondo, that he resigned\r\nhis command under Ferrando, and joined his rival. Ferrando also sent\r\nmoney to Federigo, lord of Urbino, and collected with all possible speed\r\nwhat was in those times considered a tolerable army; which, meeting the\r\nenemy upon the river Sarni, an engagement ensued in which Ferrando was\r\nrouted, and many of his principal officers taken. After this defeat, the\r\ncity of Naples alone, with a few smaller places and princes of inferior\r\nnote, adhered to Ferrando, the greater part having submitted to John.\r\nJacopo Piccinino, after the victory, advised an immediate march upon\r\nNaples; but John declined this, saying, he would first reduce the\r\nremainder of the kingdom, and then attack the seat of government. This\r\nresolution occasioned the failure of his enterprise; for he did not\r\nconsider how much more easily the members follow the head than the head\r\nthe members.\r\n\r\nAfter his defeat, Ferrando took refuge in Naples, whither the scattered\r\nremnants of his people followed him; and by soliciting his friends, he\r\nobtained money and a small force. He sent again for assistance to the\r\npope and the duke, by both of whom he was supplied more liberally\r\nand speedily than before; for they began to entertain most serious\r\napprehensions of his losing the kingdom. His hopes were thus revived;\r\nand, marching from Naples, he regained his reputation in his dominions,\r\nand soon obtained the places of which he had been deprived. While the\r\nwar was proceeding in the kingdom, a circumstance occurred by which\r\nJohn of Anjou lost his influence, and all chance of success in\r\nthe enterprise. The Genoese had become so weary of the haughty and\r\navaricious dominion of the French, that they took arms against the\r\nviceroy, and compelled him to seek refuge in the castelletto; the\r\nFregosi and the Adorni united in the enterprise against him, and were\r\nassisted with money and troops by the duke of Milan, both for the\r\nrecovery and preservation of the government. At the same time, King René\r\ncoming with a fleet to the assistance of his son, and hoping to recover\r\nGenoa by means of the castelletto, upon landing his forces was so\r\ncompletely routed, that he was compelled to return in disgrace to\r\nProvence. When the news of his father's defeat reached Naples, John was\r\ngreatly alarmed, but continued the war for a time by the assistance of\r\nthose barons who, being rebels, knew they would obtain no terms from\r\nFerrando. At length, after various trifling occurrences, the two royal\r\narmies came to an engagement, in which John was routed near Troia, in\r\nthe year 1463. He was, however, less injured by his defeat than by the\r\ndesertion of Jacopo Piccinino, who joined Ferrando; and, being abandoned\r\nby his troops, he was compelled to take refuge in Istria, and thence\r\nwithdrew to France. This war continued four years. John's failure was\r\nattributable to negligence; for victory was often within his grasp,\r\nbut he did not take proper means to secure it. The Florentines took no\r\ndecisive part in this war. John, king of Aragon, who succeeded upon the\r\ndeath of Alfonso, sent ambassadors to request their assistance for his\r\nnephew Ferrando, in compliance with the terms of the treaty recently\r\nmade with his father Alfonso. The Florentines replied, that they were\r\nunder no obligation; that they did not think proper to assist the son\r\nin a war commenced by the father with his own forces; and that as it was\r\nbegun without either their counsel or knowledge, it must be continued\r\nand concluded without their help. The ambassadors affirmed the\r\nengagement to be binding on the Florentines, and themselves to be\r\nanswerable for the event of the war; and then in great anger left the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThus with regard to external affairs, the Florentines continued\r\ntranquil during this war; but the case was otherwise with their domestic\r\nconcerns, as will be particularly shown in the following book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nConnection of the other Italian governments with the history of\r\nFlorence--Republics always disunited--Some differences are injurious;\r\nothers not so--The kind of dissensions prevailing at Florence--Cosmo de'\r\nMedici and Neri Capponi become powerful by dissimilar means--Reform\r\nin the election of magistrates favorable to Cosmo--Complaints of\r\nthe principal citizens against the reform in elections--Luca Pitti,\r\nGonfalonier of Justice, restrains the imborsations by force--Tyranny and\r\npride of Luca Pitti and his party--Palace of the Pitti--Death of\r\nCosmo de' Medici--His liberality and magnificence--His modesty--His\r\nprudence--Sayings of Cosmo.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps appear to the readers of the preceding book that,\r\nprofessing only to write of the affairs of Florence, I have dilated too\r\nmuch in speaking of those which occurred in Lombardy and Naples. But\r\nas I have not already avoided, so it is not my intention in future to\r\nforbear, similar digressions. For although we have not engaged to\r\ngive an account of the affairs of Italy, still it would be improper\r\nto neglect noticing the most remarkable of them. If they were wholly\r\nomitted, our history would not be so well understood, neither would it\r\nbe so instructive or agreeable; since from the proceedings of the other\r\nprinces and states of Italy, have most commonly arisen those wars in\r\nwhich the Florentines were compelled to take part. Thus, from the\r\nwar between John of Anjou and King Ferrando, originated those serious\r\nenmities and hatreds which ensued between Ferrando and the Florentines,\r\nparticularly the house of Medici. The king complained of a want of\r\nassistance during the war, and of the aid afforded to his enemy; and\r\nfrom his anger originated the greatest evils, as will be hereafter seen.\r\nHaving, in speaking of external affairs, come down to the year 1463, it\r\nwill be necessary in order to make our narrative of the contemporaneous\r\ndomestic transactions clearly understood, to revert to a period several\r\nyears back. But first, according to custom, I would offer a few remarks\r\nreferring to the events about to be narrated, and observe, that those\r\nwho think a republic may be kept in perfect unity of purpose are greatly\r\ndeceived. True it is, that some divisions injure republics, while others\r\nare beneficial to them. When accompanied by factions and parties they\r\nare injurious; but when maintained without them they contribute to their\r\nprosperity. The legislator of a republic, since it is impossible to\r\nprevent the existence of dissensions, must at least take care to prevent\r\nthe growth of faction. It may therefore be observed, that citizens\r\nacquire reputation and power in two ways; the one public, the other\r\nprivate. Influence is acquired publicly by winning a battle, taking\r\npossession of a territory, fulfilling the duties of an embassy with\r\ncare and prudence, or by giving wise counsel attended by a happy result.\r\nPrivate methods are conferring benefits upon individuals, defending them\r\nagainst the magistrates, supporting them with money, and raising them to\r\nundeserved honors; or with public games and entertainments gaining the\r\naffection of the populace. This mode of procedure produces parties and\r\ncliques; and in proportion as influence thus acquired is injurious, so\r\nis the former beneficial, if quite free from party spirit; because it is\r\nfounded upon the public good, and not upon private advantage. And though\r\nit is impossible to prevent the existence of inveterate feuds, still\r\nif they be without partisans to support them for their own individual\r\nbenefit, they do not injure a republic, but contribute to its welfare;\r\nsince none can attain distinction, but as he contributes to her good,\r\nand each party prevents the other from infringing her liberties. The\r\ndissensions of Florence were always accompanied by factions, and were\r\ntherefore always pernicious; and the dominant party only remained united\r\nso long as its enemies held it in check. As soon as the strength of the\r\nopposition was annihilated, the government, deprived of the restraining\r\ninfluence of its adversaries, and being subject to no law, fell to\r\npieces. The party of Cosmo de' Medici gained the ascendant in 1434; but\r\nthe depressed party being very numerous, and composed of several very\r\ninfluential persons, fear kept the former united, and restrained their\r\nproceedings within the bounds of moderation, so that no violence was\r\ncommitted by them, nor anything done calculated to excite popular\r\ndislike. Consequently, whenever this government required the citizens'\r\naid to recover or strengthen its influence, the latter were always\r\nwilling to gratify its wishes; so that from 1434 to 1455, during a\r\nperiod of twenty-one years, the authority of a balia was granted to it\r\nsix times.\r\n\r\nThere were in Florence, as we have frequently observed, two principally\r\npowerful citizens, Cosmo de' Medici and Neri Capponi. Neri acquired\r\nhis influence by public services; so that he had many friends but few\r\npartisans. Cosmo, being able to avail himself both of public and private\r\nmeans, had many partisans as well as friends. While both lived,\r\nhaving always been united, they obtained from the people whatever they\r\nrequired; for in them popularity and power were united. But in the year\r\n1455, Neri being dead, and the opposition party extinct, the government\r\nfound a difficulty in resuming its authority; and this was occasioned,\r\nremarkably enough, by Cosmo's private friends, and the most influential\r\nmen in the state; for, not fearing the opposite party, they became\r\nanxious to abate his power. This inconsistency was the beginning of\r\nthe evils which took place in 1456; so that those in power were openly\r\nadvised in the deliberative councils not to renew the power of the\r\nbalia, but to close the balloting purses, and appoint the magistrates by\r\ndrawing from the pollings or squittini previously made. To restrain this\r\ndisposition, Cosmo had the choice of two alternatives, either forcibly\r\nto assume the government, with the partisans he possessed, and drive\r\nout the others, or to allow the matter to take its course, and let his\r\nfriends see they were not depriving him of power, but rather themselves.\r\nHe chose the latter; for he well knew that at all events the purses\r\nbeing filled with the names of his own friends, he incurred no risk, and\r\ncould take the government into his own hands whenever he found occasion.\r\nThe chief offices of state being again filled by lot, the mass of the\r\npeople began to think they had recovered their liberty, and that the\r\ndecisions of the magistrates were according to their own judgments,\r\nunbiased by the influence of the Great. At the same time, the friends\r\nof different grandees were humbled; and many who had commonly seen their\r\nhouses filled with suitors and presents, found themselves destitute of\r\nboth. Those who had previously been very powerful were reduced to an\r\nequality with men whom they had been accustomed to consider inferior;\r\nand those formerly far beneath them were now become their equals. No\r\nrespect or deference was paid to them; they were often ridiculed and\r\nderided, and frequently heard themselves and the republic mentioned in\r\nthe open streets without the least deference; thus they found it was not\r\nCosmo but themselves that had lost the government. Cosmo appeared not to\r\nnotice these matters; and whenever any subject was proposed in favor\r\nof the people he was the first to support it. But the greatest cause\r\nof alarm to the higher classes, and his most favorable opportunity of\r\nretaliation, was the revival of the catasto, or property-tax of 1427, so\r\nthat individual contributions were determined by statute, and not by a\r\nset of persons appointed for its regulation.\r\n\r\nThis law being re-established, and a magistracy created to carry it into\r\neffect, the nobility assembled, and went to Cosmo to beg he would rescue\r\nthem and himself from the power of the plebeians, and restore to the\r\ngovernment the reputation which had made himself powerful and them\r\nrespected. He replied, he was willing to comply with their request, but\r\nwished the law to be obtained in the regular manner, by consent of the\r\npeople, and not by force, of which he would not hear on any account.\r\nThey then endeavored in the councils to establish a new balia, but did\r\nnot succeed. On this the grandees again came to Cosmo, and most humbly\r\nbegged he would assemble the people in a general council or parliament,\r\nbut this he refused, for he wished to make them sensible of their great\r\nmistake; and when Donato Cocchi, being Gonfalonier of Justice, proposed\r\nto assemble them without his consent, the Signors who were of Cosmo's\r\nparty ridiculed the idea so unmercifully, that the man's mind actually\r\nbecame deranged, and he had to retire from office in consequence.\r\nHowever, since it is undesirable to allow matters to proceed beyond\r\nrecovery, the Gonfalon of Justice being in the hands of Luca Pitti,\r\na bold-spirited man, Cosmo determined to let him adopt what course he\r\nthought proper, that if any trouble should arise it might be imputed\r\nto Luca and not to himself. Luca, therefore, in the beginning of his\r\nmagistracy, several times proposed to the people the appointment of\r\na new balia; and, not succeeding, he threatened the members of the\r\ncouncils with injurious and arrogant expressions, which were shortly\r\nfollowed by corresponding conduct; for in the month of August, 1458, on\r\nthe eve of Saint Lorenzo, having filled the piazza, and compelled\r\nthem to assent to a measure to which he knew them to be averse. Having\r\nrecovered power, created a new balia, and filled the principal offices\r\naccording to the pleasure of a few individuals, in order to commence\r\nthat government with terror which they had obtained by force, they\r\nbanished Girolamo Machiavelli, with some others, and deprived many of\r\nthe honors of government. Girolamo, having transgressed the confines to\r\nwhich he was limited, was declared a rebel. Traveling about Italy, with\r\nthe design of exciting the princes against his country, he was betrayed\r\nwhile at Lunigiana, and, being brought to Florence, was put to death in\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nThis government, during the eight years it continued, was violent and\r\ninsupportable; for Cosmo, being now old, and through ill health unable\r\nto attend to public affairs as formerly, Florence became a prey to a\r\nsmall number of her own citizens. Luca Pitti, in return for the services\r\nhe had performed for the republic, as made a knight, and to be no less\r\ngrateful than those who had conferred the dignity upon him, he ordered\r\nthat the priors, who had hitherto been called priors of the trades,\r\nshould also have a name to which they had no kind of claim, and\r\ntherefore called them priors of liberty. He also ordered, that as it\r\nhad been customary for the gonfalonier to sit upon the right hand of\r\nthe rectors, he should in future take his seat in the midst of them. And\r\nthat the Deity might appear to participate in what had been done, public\r\nprocessions were made and solemn services performed, to thank him for\r\nthe recovery of the government. The Signory and Cosmo made Luca Pitti\r\nrich presents, and all the citizens were emulous in imitation of them;\r\nso that the money given amounted to no less a sum than twenty thousand\r\nducats. He thus attained such influence, that not Cosmo but himself now\r\ngoverned the city; and his pride so increased, that he commenced two\r\nsuperb buildings, one in Florence, the other at Ruciano, about a mile\r\ndistant, both in a style of royal magnificence; that in the city, being\r\nlarger than any hitherto built by a private person. To complete them, he\r\nhad recourse to the most extraordinary means; for not only citizens and\r\nprivate individuals made him presents and supplied materials, but the\r\nmass of people, of every grade, also contributed. Besides this, any\r\nexiles who had committed murders, thefts, or other crimes which made\r\nthem amenable to the laws, found a safe refuge within their walls, if\r\nthey were able to contribute toward their decoration or completion. The\r\nother citizens, though they did not build like him, were no less violent\r\nor rapacious, so that if Florence were not harassed by external wars,\r\nshe was ruined by the wickedness of her own children. During this period\r\nthe wars of Naples took place. The pope also commenced hostilities in\r\nRomagna against the Malatesti, from whom he wished to take Rimino and\r\nCesena, held by them. In these designs, and his intentions of a crusade\r\nagainst the Turks, was passed the pontificate of Pius II.\r\n\r\nFlorence continued in disunion and disturbance. The dissensions\r\ncontinued among the party of Cosmo, in 1455, from the causes already\r\nrelated, which by his prudence, as we have also before remarked, he was\r\nenabled to tranquilize; but in the year 1464, his illness increased,\r\nand he died. Friends and enemies alike grieved for his loss; for his\r\npolitical opponents, perceiving the rapacity of the citizens, even\r\nduring the life of him who alone restrained them and made their tyranny\r\nsupportable, were afraid, lest after his decease, nothing but ruin would\r\nensue. Nor had they much hope of his son Piero, who though a very good\r\nman, was of infirm health, and new in the government, and they thought\r\nhe would be compelled to give way; so that, being unrestrained, their\r\nrapacity would pass all bounds. On these accounts, the regret was\r\nuniversal. Of all who have left memorials behind them, and who were not\r\nof the military profession, Cosmo was the most illustrious and the most\r\nrenowned. He not only surpassed all his contemporaries in wealth and\r\nauthority, but also in generosity and prudence; and among the qualities\r\nwhich contributed to make him prince in his own country, was his\r\nsurpassing all others in magnificence and generosity. His liberality\r\nbecame more obvious after his death, when Piero, his son, wishing\r\nto know what he possessed, it appeared there was no citizen of any\r\nconsequence to whom Cosmo had not lent a large sum of money; and often,\r\nwhen informed of some nobleman being in distress, he relieved him\r\nunasked. His magnificence is evident from the number of public edifices\r\nhe erected; for in Florence are the convents and churches of St. Marco\r\nand St. Lorenzo, and the monastery of Santa Verdiana; in the mountains\r\nof Fiesole, the church and abbey of St. Girolamo; and in the Mugello, he\r\nnot only restored, but rebuilt from its foundation, a monastery of the\r\nFrati Minori, or Minims. Besides these, in the church of Santa Croce,\r\nthe Servi, the Agnoli, and in San Miniato, he erected splendid chapels\r\nand altars; and besides building the churches and chapels we have\r\nmentioned, he provided them with all the ornaments, furniture, and\r\nutensils suitable for the performance of divine service. To these sacred\r\nedifices are to be added his private dwellings, one in Florence, of\r\nextent and elegance adapted to so great a citizen, and four others,\r\nsituated at Careggi, Fiesole, Craggiulo, and Trebbio, each, for size and\r\ngrandeur, equal to royal palaces. And, as if it were not sufficient\r\nto be distinguished for magnificence of buildings in Italy alone, he\r\nerected an hospital at Jerusalem, for the reception of poor and infirm\r\npilgrims. Although his habitations, like all his other works and\r\nactions, were quite of a regal character, and he alone was prince in\r\nFlorence, still everything was so tempered with his prudence, that\r\nhe never transgressed the decent moderation of civil life; in his\r\nconversation, his servants, his traveling, his mode of living, and the\r\nrelationships he formed, the modest demeanor of the citizen was always\r\nevident; for he was aware that a constant exhibition of pomp brings\r\nmore envy upon its possessor than greater realities borne without\r\nostentation. Thus in selecting consorts for his sons, he did not\r\nseek the alliance of princes, but for Giovanni chose Corneglia degli\r\nAllesandri, and for Piero, Lucrezia de' Tornabuoni. He gave his\r\ngranddaughters, the children of Piero, Bianca to Guglielmo de' Pazzi,\r\nand Nannina to Bernardo Ruccellai. No one of his time possessed such an\r\nintimate knowledge of government and state affairs as himself; and hence\r\namid such a variety of fortune, in a city so given to change, and among\r\na people of such extreme inconstancy, he retained possession of the\r\ngovernment thirty-one years; for being endowed with the utmost prudence,\r\nhe foresaw evils at a distance, and therefore had an opportunity either\r\nof averting them, or preventing their injurious results. He thus not\r\nonly vanquished domestic and civil ambition, but humbled the pride of\r\nmany princes with so much fidelity and address, that whatever powers\r\nwere in league with himself and his country, either overcame their\r\nadversaries, or remained uninjured by his alliance; and whoever were\r\nopposed to him, lost either their time, money, or territory. Of this\r\nthe Venetians afford a sufficient proof, who, while in league with him\r\nagainst Duke Filippo were always victorious, but apart from him were\r\nalways conquered; first by Filippo and then by Francesco. When they\r\njoined Alfonso against the Florentine republic, Cosmo, by his commercial\r\ncredit, so drained Naples and Venice of money, that they were glad to\r\nobtain peace upon any terms it was thought proper to grant. Whatever\r\ndifficulties he had to contend with, whether within the city or without,\r\nhe brought to a happy issue, at once glorious to himself and destructive\r\nto his enemies; so that civil discord strengthened his government in\r\nFlorence, and war increased his power and reputation abroad. He added\r\nto the Florentine dominions, the Borgo of St. Sepolcro, Montedoglio, the\r\nCasentino and Val di Bagno. His virtue and good fortune overcame all his\r\nenemies and exalted his friends. He was born in the year 1389, on the\r\nday of the saints Cosmo and Damiano. His earlier years were full of\r\ntrouble, as his exile, captivity, and personal danger fully testify;\r\nand having gone to the council of Constance, with Pope John, in order to\r\nsave his life, after the ruin of the latter, he was obliged to escape in\r\ndisguise. But after the age of forty, he enjoyed the greatest felicity;\r\nand not only those who assisted him in public business, but his\r\nagents who conducted his commercial speculations throughout Europe,\r\nparticipated in his prosperity. Hence many enormous fortunes took their\r\norigin in different families of Florence, as in that of the Tornabuoni,\r\nthe Benci, the Portinari, and the Sassetti. Besides these, all who\r\ndepended upon his advice and patronage became rich; and, though he\r\nwas constantly expending money in building churches, and in charitable\r\npurposes, he sometimes complained to his friends that he had never been\r\nable to lay out so much in the service of God as to find the balance in\r\nhis own favor, intimating that all he had done or could do, was still\r\nunequal to what the Almighty had done for him. He was of middle stature,\r\nolive complexion, and venerable aspect; not learned but exceedingly\r\neloquent, endowed with great natural capacity, generous to his friends,\r\nkind to the poor, comprehensive in discourse, cautious in advising,\r\nand in his speeches and replies, grave and witty. When Rinaldo degli\r\nAlbizzi, at the beginning of his exile, sent to him to say, \"the hen had\r\nlaid,\" he replied, \"she did ill to lay so far from the nest.\" Some other\r\nof the rebels gave him to understand they were \"not dreaming.\" He said,\r\n\"he believed it, for he had robbed them of their sleep.\" When Pope\r\nPius was endeavoring to induce the different governments to join in\r\nan expedition against the Turks, he said, \"he was an old man, and had\r\nundertaken the enterprise of a young one.\" To the Venetians ambassadors,\r\nwho came to Florence with those of King Alfonso to complain of the\r\nrepublic, he uncovered his head, and asked them what color it was; they\r\nsaid, \"white;\" he replied, \"it is so; and it will not be long before\r\nyour senators have heads as white as mine.\" A few hours before his\r\ndeath, his wife asked him why he kept his eyes shut, and he said, \"to\r\nget them in the way of it.\" Some citizens saying to him, after his\r\nreturn from exile, that he injured the city, and that it was offensive\r\nto God to drive so many religious persons out of it; he replied that,\r\n\"it was better to injure the city, than to ruin it; that two yards\r\nof rose-colored cloth would make a gentleman, and that it required\r\nsomething more to direct a government than to play with a string of\r\nbeads.\" These words gave occasion to his enemies to slander him, as a\r\nman who loved himself more than his country, and was more attached\r\nto this world than to the next. Many others of his sayings might be\r\nadduced, but we shall omit them as unnecessary. Cosmo was a friend and\r\npatron of learned men. He brought Argiripolo, a Greek by birth, and one\r\nof the most erudite of his time, to Florence, to instruct the youth in\r\nHellenic literature. He entertained Marsilio Ficino, the reviver of the\r\nPlatonic philosophy, in his own house; and being much attached to him,\r\nhave him a residence near his palace at Careggi, that he might pursue\r\nthe study of letters with greater convenience, and himself have an\r\nopportunity of enjoying his company. His prudence, his great wealth, the\r\nuses to which he applied it, and his splendid style of living, caused\r\nhim to be beloved and respected in Florence, and obtained for him the\r\nhighest consideration, not only among the princes and governments of\r\nItaly, but throughout all Europe. He thus laid a foundation for his\r\ndescendants, which enabled them to equal him in virtue, and greatly\r\nsurpass him in fortune; while the authority they possessed in Florence\r\nand throughout Christendom was not obtained without being merited.\r\nToward the close of his life he suffered great affliction; for, of his\r\ntwo sons, Piero and Giovanni, the latter, of whom he entertained the\r\ngreatest hopes, died; and the former was so sickly as to be unable to\r\nattend either to public or private business. On being carried from\r\none apartment to another, after Giovanni's death, he remarked to his\r\nattendants, with a sigh, \"This is too large a house for so small a\r\nfamily.\" His great mind also felt distressed at the idea that he had not\r\nextended the Florentine dominions by any valuable acquisition; and he\r\nregretted it the more, from imagining he had been deceived by Francesco\r\nSforza, who, while count, had promised, that if he became lord of Milan,\r\nhe would undertake the conquest of Lucca for the Florentines, a design,\r\nhowever, that was never realized; for the count's ideas changed upon his\r\nbecoming duke; he resolved to enjoy in peace, the power he had acquired\r\nby war, and would not again encounter its fatigues and dangers, unless\r\nthe welfare of his own dominions required it. This was a source of much\r\nannoyance to Cosmo, who felt he had incurred great expense and trouble\r\nfor an ungrateful and perfidious friend. His bodily infirmities\r\nprevented him from attending either to public or private affairs, as he\r\nhad been accustomed, and he consequently witnessed both going to decay;\r\nfor Florence was ruined by her own citizens, and his fortune by his\r\nagents and children. He died, however, at the zenith of his glory and\r\nin the enjoyment of the highest renown. The city, and all the Christian\r\nprinces, condoled with his son Piero for his loss. His funeral was\r\nconducted with the utmost pomp and solemnity, the whole city following\r\nhis corpse to the tomb in the church of St. Lorenzo, on which, by public\r\ndecree, he was inscribed, \"FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY.\" If, in speaking of\r\nCosmo's actions, I have rather imitated the biographies of princes than\r\ngeneral history, it need not occasion wonder; for of so extraordinary an\r\nindividual I was compelled to speak with unusual praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe duke of Milan becomes lord of Genoa--The king of Naples and the\r\nduke of Milan endeavor to secure their dominions to their heirs--Jacopo\r\nPiccinino honorably received at Milan, and shortly afterward murdered\r\nat Naples--Fruitless endeavors of Pius II. to excite Christendom against\r\nthe Turks--Death of Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan--Perfidious counsel\r\ngiven to Piero de' Medici by Diotisalvi Neroni--Conspiracy of\r\nDiotisalvi and others against Piero--Futile attempts to appease the\r\ndisorders--Public spectacles--Projects of the conspirators against Piero\r\nde' Medici--Niccolo Fedini discloses to Piero the plots of his enemies.\r\n\r\nWhile Florence and Italy were in this condition, Louis XI. of France\r\nwas involved in very serious troubles with his barons, who, with the\r\nassistance of Francis, duke of Brittany, and Charles, duke of Burgundy,\r\nwere in arms against him. This attack was so serious, that he was unable\r\nto render further assistance to John of Anjou in his enterprise against\r\nGenoa and Naples; and, standing in need of all the forces he could\r\nraise, he gave over Savona (which still remained in the power of the\r\nFrench) to the duke of Milan, and also intimated, that if he wished,\r\nhe had his permission to undertake the conquest of Genoa. Francesco\r\naccepted the proposal, and with the influence afforded by the king's\r\nfriendship, and the assistance of the Adorni, he became lord of Genoa.\r\nIn acknowledgment of this benefit, he sent fifteen hundred horse into\r\nFrance for the king's service, under the command of Galeazzo, his eldest\r\nson. Thus Ferrando of Aragon and Francesco Sforza became, the latter,\r\nduke of Lombardy and prince of Genoa, and the former, sovereign of the\r\nwhole kingdom of Naples. Their families being allied by marriage, they\r\nthought they might so confirm their power as to secure to themselves its\r\nenjoyment during life, and at their deaths, its unencumbered reversion\r\nto their heirs. To attain this end, they considered it necessary that\r\nthe king should remove all ground of apprehension from those barons who\r\nhad offended him in the war of John of Anjou, and that the duke should\r\nextirpate the adherents of the Bracceschi, the natural enemies of\r\nhis family, who, under Jacopo Piccinino, had attained the highest\r\nreputation. The latter was now the first general in Italy, and\r\npossessing no territory, he naturally excited the apprehension of all\r\nwho had dominions, and especially of the duke, who, conscious of what\r\nhe had himself done, thought he could neither enjoy his own estate in\r\nsafety, nor leave them with any degree of security to his son during\r\nJacopo's lifetime. The king, therefore, strenuously endeavored to come\r\nto terms with his barons, and using his utmost ingenuity to secure them,\r\nsucceeded in his object; for they perceived their ruin to be inevitable\r\nif they continued in war with their sovereign, though from submission\r\nand confidence in him, they would still have reason for apprehension.\r\nMankind are always most eager to avoid a certain evil; and hence\r\ninferior powers are easily deceived by princes. The barons, conscious\r\nof the danger of continuing the war, trusted the king's promises, and\r\nhaving placed themselves in his hands, they were soon after destroyed\r\nin various ways, and under a variety of pretexts. This alarmed Jacopo\r\nPiccinino, who was with his forces at Sulmona; and to deprive the king\r\nof the opportunity of treating him similarly, he endeavored, by the\r\nmediation of his friends, to be reconciled with the duke, who, by the\r\nmost liberal offers, induced Jacopo to visit him at Milan, accompanied\r\nby only a hundred horse.\r\n\r\nJacopo had served many years with his father and brother, first under\r\nDuke Filippo, and afterward under the Milanese republic, so that by\r\nfrequent intercourse with the citizens he had acquired many friends and\r\nuniversal popularity, which present circumstances tended to increase;\r\nfor the prosperity and newly acquired power of the Sforzeschi had\r\noccasioned envy, while Jacopo's misfortunes and long absence had given\r\nrise to compassion and a great desire to see him. These various feelings\r\nwere displayed upon his arrival; for nearly all the nobility went to\r\nmeet him; the streets through which he passed were filled with citizens,\r\nanxious to catch a glimpse of him, while shouts of \"The Bracceschi! the\r\nBracceschi!\" resounded on all sides. These honors accelerated his ruin;\r\nfor the duke's apprehensions increased his desire of destroying him; and\r\nto effect this with the least possible suspicion, Jacopo's marriage with\r\nDrusiana, the duke's natural daughter, was now celebrated. The duke then\r\narranged with Ferrando to take him into pay, with the title of captain\r\nof his forces, and give him 100,000 florins for his maintenance. After\r\nthis agreement, Jacopo, accompanied by a ducal ambassador and his wife\r\nDrusiana, proceeded to Naples, where he was honorably and joyfully\r\nreceived, and for many days entertained with every kind of festivity;\r\nbut having asked permission to go to Sulmona, where his forces were, the\r\nking invited him to a banquet in the castle, at the conclusion of which\r\nhe and his son Francesco were imprisoned, and shortly afterward put to\r\ndeath. It was thus our Italian princes, fearing those virtues in others\r\nwhich they themselves did not possess, extirpated them; and hence the\r\ncountry became a prey to the efforts of those by whom it was not long\r\nafterward oppressed and ruined.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Pope Pius II. having settled the affairs of Romagna, and\r\nwitnessing a universal peace, thought it a suitable opportunity to lead\r\nthe Christians against the Turks, and adopted measures similar to those\r\nwhich his predecessors had used. All the princes promised assistance\r\neither in men or money; while Matthias, king of Hungary, and Charles,\r\nduke of Burgundy, intimated their intention of joining the enterprise\r\nin person, and were by the pope appointed leaders of the expedition. The\r\npontiff was so full of expectation, that he left Rome and proceeded\r\nto Ancona, where it had been arranged that the whole army should be\r\nassembled, and the Venetians engaged to send ships thither to convey the\r\nforces to Sclavonia. Upon the arrival of the pope in that city,\r\nthere was soon such a concourse of people, that in a few days all\r\nthe provisions it contained, or that could be procured from the\r\nneighborhood, were consumed, and famine began to impend. Besides this,\r\nthere was no money to provide those who were in want of it, nor arms\r\nto furnish such as were without them. Neither Matthias nor Charles made\r\ntheir appearance. The Venetians sent a captain with some galleys, but\r\nrather for ostentation and the sake of keeping their word, than for the\r\npurpose of conveying troops. During this position of affairs, the pope,\r\nbeing old and infirm, died, and the assembled troops returned to their\r\nhomes. The death of the pontiff occurred in 1465, and Paul II. of\r\nVenetian origin, was chosen to succeed him; and that nearly all the\r\nprincipalities of Italy might change their rulers about the same period,\r\nin the following year Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan, also died, having\r\noccupied the dukedom sixteen years, and Galleazzo, his son, succeeded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe death of this prince infused redoubled energy into the Florentine\r\ndissensions, and caused them to produce more prompt effects than they\r\nwould otherwise have done. Upon the demise of Cosmo, his son Piero,\r\nbeing heir to the wealth and government of his father, called to his\r\nassistance Diotisalvi Neroni, a man of great influence and the highest\r\nreputation, in whom Cosmo reposed so much confidence that just before\r\nhis death he recommended Piero to be wholly guided by him, both with\r\nregard to the government of the city and the management of his fortune.\r\nPiero acquired Diotisalvi with the opinion Cosmo entertained of him,\r\nand said that as he wished to obey his father, though now no more, as\r\nhe always had while alive, he should consult him concerning both his\r\npatrimony and the city. Beginning with his private affairs, he caused\r\nan account of all his property, liabilities, and assets, to be placed in\r\nDiotisalvi's hands, that, with an entire acquaintance with the state of\r\nhis affairs, he might be able to afford suitable advice, and the latter\r\npromised to use the utmost care. Upon examination of these accounts the\r\naffairs were found to be in great disorder, and Diotisalvi, instigated\r\nrather by his own ambition than by attachment to Piero or gratitude\r\nto Cosmo, thought he might without difficulty deprive him of both\r\nthe reputation and the splendor which his father had left him as his\r\ninheritance. In order to realize his views, he waited upon Piero, and\r\nadvised him to adopt a measure which, while it appeared quite correct in\r\nitself, and suitable to existing circumstances, involved a consequence\r\ndestructive to his authority. He explained the disorder of his affairs,\r\nand the large amount of money it would be necessary to provide, if he\r\nwished to preserve his influence in the state and his reputation of\r\nwealth; and said there was no other means of remedying these disorders\r\nso just and available as to call in the sums which his father had lent\r\nto an infinite number of persons, both foreigners and citizens;\r\nfor Cosmo, to acquire partisans in Florence and friends abroad, was\r\nextremely liberal of his money, and the amount of loans due to him was\r\nenormous. Piero thought the advice good, because he was only desirous to\r\nrepossess his own property to meet the demands to which he was liable;\r\nbut as soon as he had ordered those amounts to be recalled, the\r\ncitizens, as if he had asked for something to which he had no kind of\r\nclaim, took great offense, loaded him with opprobrious expressions, and\r\naccused him of being avaricious and ungrateful.\r\n\r\nDiotisalvi, noticing the popular excitement against Piero, occasioned\r\nby his own advice, obtained an interview with Luca Pitti, Agnolo\r\nAcciajuoli, and Niccolo Soderini, and they resolved to unite their\r\nefforts to deprive him both of the government and his influence. Each\r\nwas actuated by a different motive; Luca Pitti wished to take the\r\nposition Cosmo had occupied, for he was now become so great, that he\r\ndisdained to submit to Piero; Diotisalvi Neroni, who knew Luca unfit\r\nto be at the head of a government, thought that of necessity on Piero's\r\nremoval, the whole authority of the state would devolve upon himself;\r\nNiccolo Soderini desired the city to enjoy greater liberty, and for\r\nthe laws to be equally binding upon all. Agnolo Acciajuoli was greatly\r\nincensed against the Medici, for the following reasons: his son,\r\nRaffaello, had some time before married Alessandra de' Bardi, and\r\nreceived with her a large dowry. She, either by her own fault or\r\nthe misconduct of others, suffered much ill-treatment both from her\r\nfather-in-law and her husband, and in consequence Lorenzo d' Ilarione,\r\nher kinsman, out of pity for the girl, being accompanied by several\r\narmed men, took her away from Agnolo's house. The Acciajuoli complained\r\nof the injury done them by the Bardi, and the matter was referred to\r\nCosmo, who decided that the Acciajuoli should restore to Alessandra her\r\nfortune, and then leave it to her choice either to return to her husband\r\nor not. Agnolo thought Cosmo had not, in this instance, treated him as\r\na friend; and having been unable to avenge himself on the father, he now\r\nresolved to do his utmost to ruin the son. These conspirators, though\r\neach was influenced by a different motive from the rest, affected to\r\nhave only one object in view, which was that the city should be governed\r\nby the magistrates, and not be subjected to the counsels of a few\r\nindividuals. The odium against Piero, and opportunities of injuring him,\r\nwere increased by the number of merchants who failed about this time;\r\nfor it was reported that he, in having, quite unexpectedly to all,\r\nresolved to call in his debts, had, to the disgrace and ruin of the\r\ncity, caused them to become insolvent. To this was added his endeavor\r\nto obtain Clarice degli Orsini as wife of Lorenzo, his eldest son; and\r\nhence his enemies took occasion to say, it was quite clear, that as he\r\ndespised a Florentine alliance, he no longer considered himself one of\r\nthe people, and was preparing to make himself prince; for he who refuses\r\nhis fellow-citizens as relatives, desires to make them slaves, and\r\ntherefore cannot expect to have them as friends. The leaders of the\r\nsedition thought they had the victory in their power; for the greater\r\npart of the citizens followed them, deceived by the name of liberty\r\nwhich they, to give their purpose a graceful covering, adopted upon\r\ntheir ensigns.\r\n\r\nIn this agitated state of the city, some, to whom civil discord was\r\nextremely offensive, thought it would be well to endeavor to engage\r\nmen's minds with some new occupation, because when unemployed they\r\nare commonly led by whoever chooses to excite them. To divert their\r\nattention from matters of government, it being now a year since the\r\ndeath of Cosmo, it was resolved to celebrate two festivals, similar to\r\nthe most solemn observed in the city. At one of them was represented\r\nthe arrival of the three kings from the east, led by the star which\r\nannounced the nativity of Christ; which was conducted with such pomp and\r\nmagnificence, that the preparations for it kept the whole city occupied\r\nmany months. The other was a tournament (for so they call the exhibition\r\nof equestrian combats), in which the sons of the first families in the\r\ncity took part with the most celebrated cavaliers of Italy. Among the\r\nmost distinguished of the Florentine youth was Lorenzo, eldest son of\r\nPiero, who, not by favor, but by his own personal valor, obtained the\r\nprincipal prize. When these festivals were over, the citizens reverted\r\nto the same thoughts which had previously occupied them, and each\r\npursued his ideas with more earnestness than ever. Serious differences\r\nand troubles were the result; and these were greatly increased by two\r\ncircumstances: one of which was, that the authority of the balia had\r\nexpired; the other, that upon the death of Duke Francesco, Galeazzo the\r\nnew duke sent ambassadors to Florence, to renew the engagements of his\r\nfather with the city, which, among other things, provided that every\r\nyear a certain sum of money should be paid to the duke. The principal\r\nopponents of the Medici took occasion, from this demand, to make public\r\nresistance in the councils, on pretense that the alliance was made with\r\nFrancesco and not Galeazzo; so that Francesco being dead, the obligation\r\nhad ceased; nor was there any necessity to revive it, because Galeazzo\r\ndid not possess his father's talents, and consequently they neither\r\ncould nor ought to expect the same benefits from him; that if they had\r\nderived little advantage from Francesco, they would obtain still less\r\nfrom Galeazzo; and that if any citizen wished to hire him for his own\r\npurposes, it was contrary to civil rule, and inconsistent with the\r\npublic liberty. Piero, on the contrary, argued that it would be very\r\nimpolitic to lose such an alliance from mere avarice, and that there\r\nwas nothing so important to the republic, and to the whole of Italy,\r\nas their alliance with the duke; that the Venetians, while they were\r\nunited, could not hope either by feigned friendship or open war\r\nto injure the duchy; but as soon as they perceived the Florentines\r\nalienated from him they would prepare for hostilities, and, finding him\r\nyoung, new in the government, and without friends, they would, either\r\nby force or fraud, compel him to join them; in which case ruin of the\r\nrepublic would be inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe arguments of Piero were without effect, and the animosity of the\r\nparties began to be openly manifested in their nocturnal assemblies; the\r\nfriends of the Medici meeting in the Crocetta, and their adversaries in\r\nthe Pieta. The latter being anxious for Piero's ruin, had induced many\r\ncitizens to subscribe their names as favorable to the undertaking. Upon\r\none occasion, particularly when considering the course to be adopted,\r\nalthough all agreed that the power of the Medici ought to be reduced,\r\ndifferent opinions were given concerning the means by which it should be\r\neffected; one party, the most temperate and reasonable, held that as the\r\nauthority of the balia had ceased, they must take care to prevent\r\nits renewal; it would then be found to be the universal wish that the\r\nmagistrates and councils should govern the city, and in a short time\r\nPiero's power would be visibly diminished, and, as a consequence of his\r\nloss of influence in the government, his commercial credit would also\r\nfail; for his affairs were in such a state, that if they could prevent\r\nhim from using the public money his ruin must ensue. They would thus\r\nbe in no further danger from him, and would succeed in the recovery of\r\ntheir liberty, without the death or exile of any individual; but if\r\nthey attempted violence they would incur great dangers; for mankind\r\nare willing to allow one who falls of himself to meet his fate, but if\r\npushed down they would hasten to his relief; so that if they adopted no\r\nextraordinary measures against him, he will have no reason for defense\r\nor aid; and if he were to seek them it would be greatly to his own\r\ninjury, by creating such a general suspicion as would accelerate his\r\nruin, and justify whatever course they might think proper to adopt. Many\r\nof the assembly were dissatisfied with this tardy method of proceeding;\r\nthey thought delay would be favorable to him and injurious to\r\nthemselves; for if they allowed matters to take their ordinary course,\r\nPiero would be in no danger whatever, while they themselves would incur\r\nmany; for the magistrates who were opposed to him would allow him to\r\nrule the city, and his friends would make him a prince, and their own\r\nruin would be inevitable, as happened in 1458; and though the advice\r\nthey had just heard might be most consistent with good feeling, the\r\npresent would be found to be the safest. That it would therefore be\r\nbest, while the minds of men were yet excited against him, to effect\r\nhis destruction. It must be their plan to arm themselves, and engage the\r\nassistance of the marquis of Ferrara, that they might not be destitute\r\nof troops; and if a favorable Signory were drawn, they would be in\r\ncondition to make use of them. They therefore determined to wait the\r\nformation of the new Signory, and be governed by circumstances.\r\n\r\nAmong the conspirators was Niccolo Fedini, who had acted as president of\r\ntheir assemblies. He, being induced by most certain hopes, disclosed the\r\nwhole affair to Piero, and gave him a list of those who had subscribed\r\ntheir names, and also of the conspirators. Piero was alarmed on\r\ndiscovering the number and quality of those who were opposed to him; and\r\nby the advice of his friends he resolved to take the signatures of those\r\nwho were inclined to favor him. Having employed one of his most\r\ntrusty confidants to carry his design into effect, he found so great a\r\ndisposition to change and instability, that many who had previously set\r\ndown their names among the number of his enemies, now subscribed them in\r\nhis favor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nNiccolo Soderini drawn Gonfalonier of Justice--Great hopes excited in\r\nconsequence--The two parties take arms--The fears of the Signory--Their\r\nconduct with regard to Piero--Piero's reply to the Signory--Reform of\r\ngovernment in favor of Piero de' Medici--Dispersion of his enemies--Fall\r\nof Lucca Pitti--Letter of Agnolo Acciajuoli to Piero de' Medici--Piero's\r\nanswer--Designs of the Florentine exiles--They induce the Venetians to\r\nmake war on Florence.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these events, the time arrived for the renewal of\r\nthe supreme magistracy; and Niccolo Soderini was drawn Gonfalonier\r\nof Justice. It was surprising to see by what a concourse, not only of\r\ndistinguished citizens, but also of the populace, he was accompanied to\r\nthe palace; and while on the way thither an olive wreath was placed upon\r\nhis head, to signify that upon him depended the safety and liberty\r\nof the city. This, among many similar instances, serves to prove how\r\nundesirable it is to enter upon office or power exciting inordinate\r\nexpectations; for, being unable to fulfil them (many looking for more\r\nthan it is possible to perform), shame and disappointment are the\r\nordinary results. Tommaso and Niccolo Soderini were brothers. Niccolo\r\nwas the more ardent and spirited, Tommaso the wiser man; who, being very\r\nmuch the friend of Piero, and knowing that his brother desired nothing\r\nbut the liberty of the city, and the stability of the republic, without\r\ninjury to any, advised him to make new Squittini, by which means the\r\nelection purses might be filled with the names of those favorable to his\r\ndesign. Niccolo took his brother's advice, and thus wasted the period\r\nof his magistracy in vain hopes, which his friends, the leading\r\nconspirators, allowed him to do from motives of envy; for they were\r\nunwilling that the government should be reformed by the authority\r\nof Niccolo, and thought they would be in time enough to effect their\r\npurpose under another gonfalonier. Thus the magistracy of Niccolo\r\nexpired; and having commenced many things without completing aught, he\r\nretired from office with much less credit than when he had entered upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance caused the aggrandizement of Piero's party, whose\r\nfriends entertained stronger hopes, while those who had been neutral or\r\nwavering became his adherents; so that both sides being balanced,\r\nmany months elapsed without any open demonstration of their particular\r\ndesigns. Piero's party continuing to gather strength, his enemies'\r\nindignation increased in proportion; and they now determined to effect\r\nby force what they either could not accomplish, or were unwilling to\r\nattempt by the medium of the magistrates, which was assassination of\r\nPiero, who lay sick at Careggi, and to this end order the marquis of\r\nFerrara nearer to the city with his forces, that after Piero's death he\r\nmight lead them into the piazza, and thus compel the Signory to form a\r\ngovernment according to their own wishes; for though all might not be\r\nfriendly, they trusted they would be able to induce those to submit by\r\nfear who might be opposed to them from principle.\r\n\r\nDiotisalvi, the better to conceal his design, frequently visited Piero,\r\nconversed with him respecting the union of the city, and advised him to\r\neffect it. The conspirators' designs had already been fully disclosed to\r\nPiero; besides this, Domenico Martelli had informed him, that Francesco\r\nNeroni, the brother of Diotisalvi, had endeavored to induce him to join\r\nthem, assuring him the victory was certain, and their object all but\r\nattained. Upon this, Piero resolved to take advantage of his enemies'\r\ntampering with the marquis of Ferrara, and be first in arms. He\r\ntherefore intimated that he had received a letter from Giovanni\r\nBentivogli, prince of Bologna, which informed him that the marquis of\r\nFerrara was upon the river Albo, at the head of a considerable force,\r\nwith the avowed intention of leading it to Florence; that upon this\r\nadvice he had taken up arms; after which, in the midst of a strong\r\nforce, he came to the city, when all who were disposed to support him,\r\narmed themselves also. The adverse party did the same, but not in such\r\ngood order, being unprepared. The residence of Diotisalvi being near\r\nthat of Piero, he did not think himself safe in it, but first went to\r\nthe palace and begged the Signory would endeavor to induce Piero to lay\r\ndown his arms, and thence to Luca Pitti, to keep him faithful in their\r\ncause. Niccolo Soderini displayed the most activity; for taking arms,\r\nand being followed by nearly all the plebeians in his vicinity, he\r\nproceeded to the house of Luca, and begged that he would mount his\r\nhorse, and come to the piazza in support of the Signory, who were, he\r\nsaid, favorable, and that the victory would, undoubtedly, be on their\r\nside; that he should not stay in the house to be basely slain by their\r\narmed enemies, or ignominiously deceived by those who were unarmed; for,\r\nin that case, he would soon repent of having neglected an opportunity\r\nirrecoverably lost; that if he desired the forcible ruin of Piero, he\r\nmight easily effect it; and that if he were anxious for peace, it would\r\nbe far better to be in a condition to propose terms than to be compelled\r\nto accept any that might be offered. These words produced no effect upon\r\nLuca, whose mind was now quite made up; he had been induced to desert\r\nhis party by new conditions and promises of alliance from Piero; for one\r\nof his nieces had been married to Giovanni Tornabuoni. He, therefore,\r\nadvised Niccolo to dismiss his followers and return home, telling him\r\nhe ought to be satisfied, if the city were governed by the magistrates,\r\nwhich would certainly be the case, and that all ought to lay aside their\r\nweapons; for the Signory, most of whom were friendly, would decide their\r\ndifferences. Niccolo, finding him impracticable, returned home; but\r\nbefore he left, he said, \"I can do the city no good alone, but I can\r\neasily foresee the evils that will befall her. This resolution of yours\r\nwill rob our country of her liberty; you will lose the government, I\r\nshall lose my property, and the rest will be exiled.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this disturbance the Signory closed the palace and kept their\r\nmagistrates about them, without showing favor to either party. The\r\ncitizens, especially those who had followed Luca Pitti, finding Piero\r\nfully prepared and his adversaries unarmed, began to consider, not how\r\nthey might injure him, but how, with least observation, glide into\r\nthe ranks of his friends. The principal citizens, the leaders of both\r\nfactions, assembled in the palace in the presence of the Signory,\r\nand spoke respecting the state of the city and the reconciliation\r\nof parties; and as the infirmities of Piero prevented him from being\r\npresent, they, with one exception, unanimously determined to wait upon\r\nhim at his house. Niccolo Soderini having first placed his children\r\nand his effects under the care of his brother Tommaso, withdrew to his\r\nvilla, there to await the event, but apprehended misfortune to himself\r\nand ruin to his country. The other citizens coming into Piero's\r\npresence, one of them who had been appointed spokesman, complained of\r\nthe disturbances that had arisen in the city, and endeavored to show,\r\nthat those must be most to blame who had been first to take up arms; and\r\nnot knowing what Piero (who was evidently the first to do so) intended,\r\nthey had come in order to be informed of his design, and if it had in\r\nview the welfare of the city, they were desirous of supporting it. Piero\r\nreplied, that not those who first take arms are the most to blame, but\r\nthose who give the first occasion for it, and if they would reflect a\r\nlittle on their mode of proceeding toward himself, they would cease to\r\nwonder at what he had done; for they could not fail to perceive, that\r\nnocturnal assemblies, the enrollment of partisans, and attempts to\r\ndeprive him both of his authority and his life, had caused him to take\r\narms; and they might further observe, that as his forces had not quitted\r\nhis own house, his design was evidently only to defend himself and not\r\nto injure others. He neither sought nor desired anything but safety and\r\nrepose; neither had his conduct ever manifested a desire for ought else;\r\nfor when the authority of the Balia expired, he never made any attempt\r\nto renew it, and was very glad the magistrates had governed the city and\r\nhad been content. They might also remember that Cosmo and his sons could\r\nlive respected in Florence, either with the Balia or without it, and\r\nthat in 1458, it was not his family, but themselves, who had renewed it.\r\nThat if they did not wish for it at present, neither did he; but this\r\ndid not satisfy them; for he perceived that they thought it impossible\r\nto remain in Florence while he was there. It was entirely beyond all\r\nhis anticipations that his own or his father's friends should think\r\nthemselves unsafe with him in Florence, having always shown himself\r\nquiet and peaceable. He then addressed himself to Diotisalvi and his\r\nbrothers, who were present, reminding them with grave indignation, of\r\nthe benefits they had received from Cosmo, the confidence he had reposed\r\nin them and their subsequent ingratitude; and his words so strongly\r\nexcited some present, that had he not interfered, they would certainly\r\nhave torn the Neroni to pieces on the spot. He concluded by saying, that\r\nhe should approve of any determination of themselves and the Signory;\r\nand that for his own part, he only desired peace and safety. After this,\r\nmany things were discussed, but nothing determined, excepting generally,\r\nthat it was necessary to reform the administration of the city and\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Gonfalon of Justice was then in the hands of Bernardo Lotti, a man\r\nnot in the confidence of Piero, who was therefore disinclined to attempt\r\naught while he was in office; but no inconvenience would result from the\r\ndelay, as his magistracy was on the point of expiring. Upon the election\r\nof Signors for the months of September and October, 1466, Roberto Lioni\r\nwas appointed to the supreme magistracy, and as soon as he assumed its\r\nduties, every requisite arrangement having been previously made, the\r\npeople were called to the piazza, and a new Balia created, wholly in\r\nfavor of Piero, who soon afterward filled all the offices of government\r\naccording to his own pleasure. These transactions alarmed the leaders of\r\nthe opposite faction, and Agnolo Acciajuoli fled to Naples, Diotisalvi\r\nNeroni and Niccolo Soderini to Venice. Luca Pitti remained in Florence,\r\ntrusting to his new relationship and the promises of Piero. The refugees\r\nwere declared rebels, and all the family of the Neroni were dispersed.\r\nGiovanni di Neroni, then archbishop of Florence, to avoid a greater\r\nevil, became a voluntary exile at Rome, and to many other citizens\r\nwho fled, various places of banishment were appointed. Nor was this\r\nconsidered sufficient; for it was ordered that the citizens should go\r\nin solemn procession to thank God for the preservation of the government\r\nand the reunion of the city, during the performance of which, some were\r\ntaken and tortured, and part of them afterward put to death and exiled.\r\nIn this great vicissitude of affairs, there was not a more remarkable\r\ninstance of the uncertainty of fortune than Luca Pitti, who soon found\r\nthe difference between victory and defeat, honor and disgrace. His house\r\nnow presented only a vast solitude, where previously crowds of citizens\r\nhad assembled. In the streets, his friends and relatives, instead of\r\naccompanying, were afraid even to salute him. Some of them were deprived\r\nof the honors of government, others of their property, and all alike\r\nthreatened. The superb edifices he had commenced were abandoned by\r\nthe builders; the benefits that had been conferred upon him, where now\r\nexchanged for injuries, the honors for disgrace. Hence many of those who\r\nhad presented him with articles of value now demanded them back again,\r\nas being only lent; and those who had been in the habit of extolling\r\nhim as a man of surpassing excellence, now termed him violent and\r\nungrateful. So that, when too late, he regretted not having taken the\r\nadvice of Niccolo Soderini, and preferred an honorable death in battle,\r\nthan to a life of ignominy among his victorious enemies.\r\n\r\nThe exiles now began to consider various means of recovering that\r\ncitizenship which they had not been able to preserve. However, Agnolo\r\nAcciajuoli being at Naples, before he attempted anything else, resolved\r\nto sound Piero, and try if he could effect a reconciliation. For this\r\npurpose, he wrote to him in the following terms: \"I cannot help laughing\r\nat the freaks of fortune, perceiving how, at her pleasure, she converts\r\nfriends into enemies, and enemies into friends. You may remember that\r\nduring your father's exile, regarding more the injury done to him than\r\nmy own misfortunes, I was banished, and in danger of death, and never\r\nduring Cosmo's life failed to honor and support your family; neither\r\nhave I since his death ever entertained a wish to injure you. True,\r\nit is, that your own sickness, and the tender years of your sons,\r\nso alarmed me, that I judged it desirable to give such a form to the\r\ngovernment, that after your death our country might not be ruined; and\r\nhence, the proceedings, which not against you, but for the safety of\r\nthe state, have been adopted, which, if mistaken, will surely obtain\r\nforgiveness, both for the good design in view, and on account of my\r\nformer services. Neither can I apprehend, that your house, having found\r\nme so long faithful, should now prove unmerciful, or that you could\r\ncancel the impression of so much merit for so small a fault.\" Piero\r\nreplied: \"Your laughing in your present abode is the cause why I do\r\nnot weep, for were you to laugh in Florence, I should have to weep at\r\nNaples. I confess you were well disposed toward my father, and you ought\r\nto confess you were well paid for it; and the obligation is so much the\r\ngreater on your part than on ours, as deeds are of greater value than\r\nwords. Having been recompensed for your good wishes, it ought not to\r\nsurprise you that you now receive the due reward of your bad ones.\r\nNeither will a pretense of your patriotism excuse you, for none will\r\nthink the city less beloved or benefited by the Medici, than by the\r\nAcciajuoli. It, therefore, seems but just, that you should remain in\r\ndishonor at Naples, since you knew not how to live with honor at home.\"\r\n\r\nAgnolo, hopeless of obtaining pardon, went to Rome, where, joining the\r\narchbishop and other refugees, they used every available means to injure\r\nthe commercial credit of the Medici in that city. Their attempts greatly\r\nannoyed Piero; but by his friends' assistance, he was enabled to render\r\nthem abortive. Diotisalvi Neroni and Niccolo Soderini strenuously urged\r\nthe Venetian senate to make war upon their country, calculating, that\r\nin case of an attack, the government being new and unpopular, would\r\nbe unable to resist. At this time there resided at Ferrara, Giovanni\r\nFrancesco, son of Palla Strozzi, who, with his father, was banished from\r\nFlorence in the changes of 1434. He possessed great influence, and was\r\nconsidered one of the richest merchants. The newly banished pointed out\r\nto Giovanni Francesco how easily they might return to their country,\r\nif the Venetians were to undertake the enterprise, and that it was most\r\nprobable they would do so, if they had pecuniary assistance, but that\r\notherwise it would be doubtful. Giovanni Francesco, wishing to avenge\r\nhis own injuries, at once fell in with their ideas, and promised to\r\ncontribute to the success of the attempt all the means in his power.\r\nOn this they went to the Doge, and complained of the exile they were\r\ncompelled to endure, for no other reason, they said, than for having\r\nwished their country should be subject to equal laws, and that the\r\nmagistrates should govern, not a few private individuals; that Piero de'\r\nMedici, with his adherents, who were accustomed to act tyrannically, had\r\nsecretly taken up arms, deceitfully induced them to lay their own aside,\r\nand thus, by fraud, expelled them from their country; that, not content\r\nwith this, they made the Almighty himself a means of oppression to\r\nseveral, who, trusting to their promises, had remained in the city\r\nand were there betrayed; for, during public worship and solemn\r\nsupplications, that the Deity might seem to participate in their\r\ntreachery, many citizens had been seized, imprisoned, tortured, and put\r\nto death; thus affording to the world a horrible and impious precedent.\r\nTo avenge themselves for these injuries, they knew not where to turn\r\nwith so much hope of success as to the senate, which, having always\r\nenjoyed their liberty, ought to compassionate those who had lost it.\r\nThey therefore called upon them as free men to assist them against\r\ntyrants; as pious, against the wicked; and would remind the Venetians,\r\nthat it was the family of the Medici who had robbed them of their\r\ndominions in Lombardy, contrary to the wish of the other citizens,\r\nand who, in opposition to the interests of the senate, had favored and\r\nsupported Francesco, so, that if the exiles' distresses could not induce\r\nthem to undertake the war, the just indignation of the people of Venice,\r\nand their desire of vengeance ought to prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWar between the Venetians and the Florentines--Peace\r\nre-established--Death of Niccolo Soderini--His character--Excesses in\r\nFlorence--Various external events from 1468 to 1471--Accession of Sixtus\r\nIV.--His character--Grief of Piero de' Medici for the violence committed\r\nin Florence--His speech to the principal citizens--Plans of Piero de'\r\nMedici for the restoration of order--His death and character--Tommaso\r\nSoderini, a citizen of great reputation, declares himself in favor of\r\nthe Medici--Disturbances at Prato occasioned by Bernardo Nardi.\r\n\r\nThe concluding words of the Florentine exiles produced the utmost\r\nexcitement among the Venetian senators, and they resolved to send\r\nBernardo Coglione, their general, to attack the Florentine territory.\r\nThe troops were assembled, and joined by Ercole da Esti, who had been\r\nsent by Borgo, marquis of Ferrara. At the commencement of hostilities,\r\nthe Florentines not being prepared, their enemies burned the Borgo of\r\nDovadola, and plundered the surrounding country. But having expelled the\r\nenemies of Piero, renewed their league with Galeazzo, duke of Milan, and\r\nFerrando, king of Naples, they appointed to the command of their forces\r\nFederigo, count of Urbino; and being thus on good terms with their\r\nfriends, their enemies occasioned them less anxiety. Ferrando sent\r\nAlfonso, his eldest son, to their aid, and Galeazzo came in person,\r\neach at the head of a suitable force, and all assembled at Castrocaro,\r\na fortress belonging to the Florentines, and situated among the roots of\r\nthe Appennines which descend from Tuscany to Romagna. In the meantime,\r\nthe enemy withdrew toward Imola. A few slight skirmishes took place\r\nbetween the armies; yet, in accordance with the custom of the times,\r\nneither of them acted on the offensive, besieged any town, or gave the\r\nother an opportunity of coming to a general engagement; but each kept\r\nwithin their tents, and conducted themselves with most remarkable\r\ncowardice. This occasioned general dissatisfaction among the\r\nFlorentines; for they found themselves involved in an expensive war,\r\nfrom which no advantage could be derived. The magistrates complained\r\nof these spiritless proceedings to those who had been appointed\r\ncommissaries to the expedition; but they replied, that the entire evil\r\nwas chargeable upon the Duke Galeazzo, who possessing great authority\r\nand little experience, was unable to suggest useful measures, and\r\nunwilling to take the advice of those who were more capable; and\r\ntherefore any demonstration of courage or energy would be impracticable\r\nso long as he remained with the army. Hereupon the Florentines\r\nintimated to the duke, that his presence with the force was in many\r\nways advantageous and beneficial, and of itself sufficient to alarm the\r\nenemy; but they considered his own safety and that of his dominions,\r\nmuch more important than their own immediate convenience; because so\r\nlong as the former were safe, the Florentines had nothing to fear, and\r\nall would go well; but if his dominions were to suffer, they might then\r\napprehend all kinds of misfortune. They assured him they did not think\r\nit prudent for him to be absent so long from Milan, having recently\r\nsucceeded to the government, and being surrounded by many powerful\r\nenemies and suspected neighbors; while any who were desirous of plotting\r\nagainst him, had an opportunity of doing so with impunity. They would,\r\ntherefore, advise him to return to his territories, leaving part of\r\nhis troops with them for the use of the expedition. This advice pleased\r\nGaleazzo, who, in consequence, immediately withdrew to Milan. The\r\nFlorentine generals being now left without any hindrance, to show that\r\nthe cause assigned for their inaction was the true one, pressed the\r\nenemy more closely, so that they came to a regular engagement, which\r\ncontinued half a day, without either party yielding. Some horses were\r\nwounded and prisoners taken, but no death occurred. Winter having\r\narrived, and with it the usual time for armies to retire into quarters,\r\nBartolommeo Coglione withdrew to Ravenna, the Florentine forces into\r\nTuscany, and those of the king and duke, each to the territories of\r\ntheir sovereign. As this attempt had not occasioned any tumult in\r\nFlorence, contrary to the rebels' expectation, and the troops they had\r\nhired were in want of pay, terms of peace were proposed, and easily\r\narranged. The revolted Florentines, thus deprived of hope, dispersed\r\nthemselves in various places. Diotisalvi Neroni withdrew to Ferrara,\r\nwhere he was received and entertained by the Marquis Borso. Niccolo\r\nSoderini went to Ravenna, where, upon a small pension allowed by the\r\nVenetians, he grew old and died. He was considered a just and brave man,\r\nbut over-cautious and slow to determine, a circumstance which occasioned\r\nhim, when Gonfalonier of Justice, to lose the opportunity of victory\r\nwhich he would have gladly recovered when too late.\r\n\r\nUpon the restoration of peace, those who remained victorious in\r\nFlorence, as if unable to convince themselves they had conquered, unless\r\nthey oppressed not merely their enemies, but all whom they suspected,\r\nprevailed upon Bardo Altoviti, then Gonfalonier of Justice, to deprive\r\nmany of the honors of government, and to banish several more. They\r\nexercised their power so inconsiderately, and conducted themselves in\r\nsuch an arbitrary manner, that it seemed as if fortune and the Almighty\r\nhad given the city up to them for a prey. Piero knew little of these\r\nthings, and was unable to remedy even the little he knew, on account\r\nof his infirmities; his body being so contracted that he could use no\r\nfaculty but that of speech. All he could do was to admonish the leading\r\nmen, and beg they would conduct themselves with greater moderation, and\r\nnot by their violence effect their country's ruin. In order to divert\r\nthe city, he resolved to celebrate the marriage of his son Lorenzo\r\nwith Clarice degli Orsini with great splendor; and it was accordingly\r\nsolemnized with all the display suitable to the exalted rank of the\r\nparties. Feasts, dancing, and antique representations occupied many\r\ndays; at the conclusion of which, to exhibit the grandeur of the house\r\nof Medici and of the government, two military spectacles were presented,\r\none performed by men on horseback, who went through the evolutions of\r\na field engagement, and the other representing the storming of a\r\ntown; everything being conducted with admirable order and the greatest\r\nimaginable brilliancy.\r\n\r\nDuring these transactions in Florence, the rest of Italy, though at\r\npeace, was filled with apprehension of the power of the Turks, who\r\ncontinued to attack the Christians, and had taken Negropont, to the\r\ngreat disgrace and injury of the Christian name. About this time died\r\nBorso, marquis of Ferrara, who was succeeded by his brother Ercole.\r\nGismondo da Rimini, the inveterate enemy of the church also expired, and\r\nhis natural brother Roberto, who was afterward one of the best generals\r\nof Italy, succeeded him. Pope Paul died, and was succeeded by Sixtus IV.\r\npreviously called Francesco da Savona, a man of the very lowest origin,\r\nwho by his talents had become general of the order of St. Francis, and\r\nafterward cardinal. He was the first who began to show how far a pope\r\nmight go, and how much that which was previously regarded as sinful lost\r\nits iniquity when committed by a pontiff. Among others of his family\r\nwere Piero and Girolamo, who, according to universal belief, were his\r\nsons, though he designated them by terms reflecting less scandal on\r\nhis character. Piero being a priest, was advanced to the dignity of a\r\ncardinal, with the title of St. Sixtus. To Girolamo he gave the city\r\nof Furli, taken from Antonio Ordelaffi, whose ancestors had held that\r\nterritory for many generations. This ambitious method of procedure made\r\nhim more regarded by the princes of Italy, and all sought to obtain\r\nhis friendship. The duke of Milan gave his natural daughter Caterina to\r\nGirolamo, with the city of Imola, which he had taken from Taddeo degli\r\nAlidossi, as her portion. New matrimonial alliances were formed between\r\nthe duke and king Ferrando; Elisabetta, daughter of Alfonso, the king's\r\neldest son, being united to Giovan Galeazzo, the eldest son of the duke.\r\n\r\nItaly being at peace, the principal employment of her princes was to\r\nwatch each other, and strengthen their own influence by new alliances,\r\nleagues, or friendships. But in the midst of this repose, Florence\r\nendured great oppression from her principal citizens, and the\r\ninfirmities of Piero incapacitated him from restraining their ambition.\r\nHowever, to relieve his conscience, and, if possible, to make them\r\nashamed of their conduct, he sent for them to his house, and addressed\r\nthem in the following words: \"I never thought a time would come when the\r\nbehavior of my friends would compel me to esteem and desire the society\r\nof my enemies, and wish that I had been defeated rather than victorious;\r\nfor I believed myself to be associated with those who would set some\r\nbounds to their avarice, and who, after having avenged themselves on\r\ntheir enemies, and lived in their country with security and honor, would\r\nbe satisfied. But now I find myself greatly deceived, unacquainted with\r\nthe ambition of mankind, and least of all with yours; for, not satisfied\r\nwith being masters of so great a city, and possessing among yourselves\r\nthose honors, dignities, and emoluments which used to be divided among\r\nmany citizens; not contented with having shared among a few the property\r\nof your enemies, or with being able to oppress all others with public\r\nburdens, while you yourselves are exempt from them, and enjoy all the\r\npublic offices of profit you must still further load everyone with ill\r\nusage. You plunder your neighbors of their wealth; you sell justice;\r\nyou evade the law; you oppress the timid and exalt the insolent. Nor\r\nis there, throughout all Italy, so many and such shocking examples of\r\nviolence and avarice as in this city. Has our country fostered us only\r\nto be her destroyer? Have we been victorious only to effect her ruin?\r\nHas she honored us that we may overwhelm her with disgrace? Now, by that\r\nfaith which is binding upon all good men, I promise you, that if you\r\nstill conduct yourselves so as to make me regret my victory, I will\r\nadopt such measures as shall cause you bitterly to repent of having\r\nmisused it.\" The reply of the citizens accorded with the time and\r\ncircumstances, but they did not forego their evil practices; so that,\r\nin consequence, Piero sent for Agnolo Acciajuoli to come secretly to\r\nCafaggiolo, and discussed with him at great length the condition of the\r\ncity; and doubtless, had he not been prevented by death, he would have\r\ncalled home the exiles as a check upon the rapine of the opposite party.\r\nBut these honorable designs were frustrated; for, sinking under bodily\r\ninfirmities and mental anguish, he expired in the fifty-third year\r\nof his age. His goodness and virtue were not duly appreciated by his\r\ncountry, principally from his having, until almost the close of his\r\nlife, been associated with Cosmo, and the few years he survived being\r\nspent in civil discord and constant debility. Piero was buried in the\r\nchurch of St. Lorenzo, near his father, and his obsequies were performed\r\nwith all the pomp and solemnity due to his exalted station. He left two\r\nsons, Lorenzo and Guiliano, whose extreme youth excited alarm in the\r\nminds of thinking men, though each gave hopes of future usefulness to\r\nthe republic.\r\n\r\nAmong the principal citizens in the government of Florence, and very\r\nsuperior to the rest, was Tommaso Soderini, whose prudence and authority\r\nwere well known not only at home, but throughout Italy. After Piero's\r\ndeath, the whole city looked up to him; many citizens waited upon him\r\nat his own house, as the head of the government, and several princes\r\naddressed him by letter; but he, impartially estimating his own\r\nfortune and that of the house of Medici, made no reply to the princes'\r\ncommunications, and told the citizens, it was not his house, but that\r\nof the Medici they ought to visit. To demonstrate by his actions the\r\nsincerity and integrity of his advice he assembled all the heads of\r\nnoble families in the convent of St. Antonio, whither he also brought\r\nLorenzo and Guiliano de' Medici, and in a long and serious speech upon\r\nthe state of the city, the condition of Italy, and the views of her\r\nprinces, he assured them, that if they wished to live in peace and unity\r\nin Florence, free both from internal dissensions and foreign wars,\r\nit would be necessary to respect the sons of Piero and support the\r\nreputation of their house; for men never regret their continuance in a\r\ncourse sanctioned by custom while new methods are soon adopted and as\r\nspeedily set aside; and it has always been found easier to maintain a\r\npower which by its continuance has outlived envy, than to raise a new\r\none, which innumerable unforeseen causes may overthrow. When Tommaso\r\nhad concluded, Lorenzo spoke, and, though young, with such modesty and\r\ndiscretion that all present felt a presentiment of his becoming what he\r\nafterward proved to be; and before the citizens departed they swore to\r\nregard the youths as their sons, and the brothers promised to look upon\r\nthem as their parents. After this, Lorenzo and Guiliano were honored as\r\nprinces, and resolved to be guided by the advice of Tommaso Soderini.\r\n\r\nWhile profound tranquillity prevailed both at home and abroad, no wars\r\ndisturbing the general repose, there arose an unexpected disturbance,\r\nwhich came like a presage of future evils. Among the ruined families of\r\nthe party of Luca Pitti, was that of the Nardi; for Salvestro and his\r\nbrothers, the heads of the house, were banished and afterward declared\r\nrebels for having taken part in the war under Bartolommeo Coglione.\r\nBernardo, the brother of Salvestro, was young, prompt, and bold, and on\r\naccount of his poverty being unable to alleviate the sorrows of exile,\r\nwhile the peace extinguished all hopes of his return to the city, he\r\ndetermined to attempt some means of rekindling the war; for a trifling\r\ncommencement often produces great results, and men more readily\r\nprosecute what is already begun than originate new enterprises. Bernardo\r\nhad many acquaintances at Prato, and still more in the district of\r\nPistoia, particularly among the Palandra, a family which, though rustic,\r\nwas very numerous, and, like the rest of the Pistolesi, brought up to\r\nslaughter and war. These he knew to be discontented, on account of the\r\nFlorentine magistrates having endeavored, perhaps too severely, to check\r\ntheir partiality for inveterate feuds and consequence bloodshed. He was\r\nalso aware that the people of Prato considered themselves injured by the\r\npride and avarice of their governors, and that some were ill disposed\r\ntoward Florence; therefore all things considered, he hoped to be able to\r\nkindle a fire in Tuscany (should Prato rebel) which would be fostered\r\nby so many, that those who might wish to extinguish it would fail in the\r\nattempt. He communicated his ideas to Diotisalvi Neroni, and asked\r\nhim, in case they should succeed in taking possession of Prato, what\r\nassistance might be expected from the princes of Italy, by his means?\r\nDiotisalvi considered the enterprise as imminently dangerous, and almost\r\nimpracticable; but since it presented a fresh chance of attaining his\r\nobject, at the risk of others, he advised him to proceed, and promised\r\ncertain assistance from Bologna and Ferrara, if he could retain Prato\r\nnot less than fifteen days. Bernardo, whom this promise inspired with\r\na lively hope of success, proceeded secretly to Prato, and communicated\r\nwith those most disposed to favor him, among whom were the Palandra; and\r\nhaving arranged the time and plan, informed Diotisalvi of what had been\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBernardo takes possession of Prato, but is not assisted by the\r\ninhabitants--He is taken, and the tumult appeased--Corruption of\r\nFlorence--The duke of Milan in Florence--The church of Santo Spirito\r\ndestroyed by fire--The rebellion of Volterra, and the cause of\r\nit--Volterra reduced to obedience by force, in accordance with the\r\nadvice of Lorenzo de' Medici--Volterra pillaged.\r\n\r\nCesare Petrucci held the office of Provost of Prato for the Florentine\r\npeople, at this period. It is customary with governors of towns,\r\nsimilarly situated, to keep the keys of the gates near their persons;\r\nand whenever, in peaceful times, they are required by any of the\r\ninhabitants, for entrance or exit, they are usually allowed to be taken.\r\nBernardo was aware of this custom, and about daybreak, presented himself\r\nat the gate which looks toward Pistoia, accompanied by the Palandra and\r\nabout one hundred persons, all armed. Their confederates within the town\r\nalso armed themselves, and one of them asked the governor for the keys,\r\nalleging, as a pretext, that some one from the country wished to enter.\r\nThe governor not entertaining the slightest suspicion, sent a servant\r\nwith them. When at a convenient distance, they were taken by the\r\nconspirators, who, opening the gates, introduced Bernardo and his\r\nfollowers. They divided themselves into two parties, one of which, led\r\nby Salvestro, an inhabitant of Prato, took possession of the citadel;\r\nthe other following Bernardo, seized the palace, and placed Cesare with\r\nall his family in the custody of some of their number. They then raised\r\nthe cry of liberty, and proceeded through the town. It was now day,\r\nand many of the inhabitants hearing the disturbance, ran to the piazza\r\nwhere, learning that the fortress and the palace were taken and\r\nthe governor with all his people made prisoners, they were utterly\r\nastonished, and could not imagine how it had occurred. The eight\r\ncitizens, possessing the supreme authority, assembled in their palace\r\nto consider what was best to be done. In the meantime, Bernardo and his\r\nfollowers, on going round the town, found no encouragement, and being\r\ntold that the Eight had assembled, went and declared the nature of\r\ntheir enterprise, which he said was to deliver the country from slavery,\r\nreminding them how glorious it would be for those who took arms to\r\neffect such an honorable object, for they would thus obtain permanent\r\nrepose and everlasting fame. He called to recollection their ancient\r\nliberty and present condition, and assured them of certain assistance,\r\nif they would only, for a few days, aid in resisting the forces the\r\nFlorentines might send against them. He said he had friends in Florence\r\nwho would join them as soon as they found the inhabitants resolved to\r\nsupport him. His speech did not produce the desired effect upon the\r\nEight, who replied that they knew not whether Florence was free or\r\nenslaved, for that was a matter which they were not called upon to\r\ndecide; but this they knew very well, that for their own part, they\r\ndesired no other liberty than to obey the magistrates who governed\r\nFlorence, from whom they had never received any injury sufficient\r\nto make them desire a change. They therefore advised him to set the\r\ngovernor at liberty, clear the place of his people, and, as quickly as\r\npossible, withdraw from the danger he had so rashly incurred. Bernardo\r\nwas not daunted by these words, but determined to try whether fear\r\ncould influence the people of Prato, since entreaties produced so little\r\neffect. In order to terrify them, he determined to put Cesare to death,\r\nand having brought him out of prison, ordered him to be hanged at the\r\nwindows of the palace. He was already led to the spot with a halter\r\naround his neck, when seeing Bernardo giving directions to hasten\r\nhis end, he turned to him, and said: \"Bernardo, you put me to death,\r\nthinking that the people of Prato will follow you; but the direct\r\ncontrary will result; for the respect they have for the rectors which\r\nthe Florentine people send here is so great, that as soon as they\r\nwitness the injury inflicted upon me, they will conceive such a disgust\r\nagainst you as will inevitably effect your ruin. Therefore, it is not\r\nby my death, but by the preservation of my life, that you can attain the\r\nobject you have in view; for if I deliver your commands, they will be\r\nmuch more readily obeyed, and following your directions, we shall soon\r\nattain the completion of your design.\" Bernardo, whose mind was not\r\nfertile in expedients, thought the advice good, and commanded Cesare, on\r\nbeing conducted to a veranda which looked upon the piazza, to order the\r\npeople of Prato to obey him, and having done which, Cesare was led back\r\nto prison.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the conspirators was obvious; and many Florentines\r\nresiding in the town, assembled together, among whom, Giorgio Ginori, a\r\nknight of Rhodes, took arms first against them, and attacked Bernardo,\r\nwho traversed the piazza, alternately entreating and threatening those\r\nwho refused to obey him, and being surrounded by Giorgio's followers, he\r\nwas wounded and made prisoner. This being done, it was easy to set the\r\ngovernor at liberty and subdue the rest, who being few, and divided into\r\nseveral parties, were nearly all either secured or slain. An exaggerated\r\nreport of these transactions reached Florence, it being told there that\r\nPrato was taken, the governor and his friends put to death, and the\r\nplace filled with the enemy; and that Pistoia was also in arms, and\r\nmost of the citizens in the conspiracy. In consequence of this alarming\r\naccount, the palace as quickly filled with citizens, who consulted with\r\nthe Signory what course ought to be adopted. At this time, Roberto da\r\nSan Severino, one of the most distinguished generals of this period,\r\nwas at Florence, and it was therefore determined to send him, with what\r\nforces could be collected, to Prato, with orders that he should approach\r\nthe place, particularly observe what was going on, and provide such\r\nremedies as the necessity of the case and his own prudence should\r\nsuggest. Roberto had scarcely passed the fortress of Campi, when he was\r\nmet by a messenger from the governor, who informed him that Bernardo was\r\ntaken, his followers either dispersed or slain, and everything restored\r\nto order. He consequently returned to Florence, whither Bernardo was\r\nshortly after conveyed, and when questioned by the magistracy concerning\r\nthe real motives of such a weak conspiracy, he said, he had undertaken\r\nit, because, having resolved to die in Florence rather than live in\r\nexile, he wished his death to be accompanied by some memorable action.\r\n\r\nThis disturbance having been raised and quelled almost at the same time,\r\nthe citizens returned to their accustomed mode of life, hoping to enjoy,\r\nwithout anxiety, the state they had now established and confirmed. Hence\r\narose many of those evils which usually result from peace; for the youth\r\nhaving become more dissolute than before, more extravagant in dress,\r\nfeasting, and other licentiousness, and being without employment, wasted\r\ntheir time and means on gaming and women; their principal study being\r\nhow to appear splendid in apparel, and attain a crafty shrewdness in\r\ndiscourse; he who could make the most poignant remark being considered\r\nthe wisest, and being most respected. These manners derived additional\r\nencouragement from the followers of the duke of Milan, who, with his\r\nduchess and the whole ducal court, as it was said, to fulfill a vow,\r\ncame to Florence, where he was received with all the pomp and respect\r\ndue to so great a prince, and one so intimately connected with\r\nthe Florentine people. Upon this occasion the city witnessed an\r\nunprecedented exhibition; for, during Lent, when the church commands us\r\nto abstain from animal food, the Milanese, without respect for either\r\nGod or his church, ate of it daily. Many spectacles were exhibited in\r\nhonor of the duke, and among others, in the temple of Santo Spirito,\r\nwas represented the descent of the Holy Ghost among the apostles; and\r\nin consequence of the numerous fires used upon the occasion, some of the\r\nwoodwork became ignited, and the church was completely destroyed by the\r\nflames. Many thought that the Almighty being offended at our misconduct,\r\ntook this method of signifying his displeasure. If, therefore, the duke\r\nfound the city full of courtly delicacies, and customs unsuitable to\r\nwell-regulated conduct, he left it in a much worse state. Hence the good\r\ncitizens thought it necessary to restrain these improprieties, and made\r\na law to put a stop to extravagance in dress, feasts, and funerals.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this universal peace, a new and unexpected disturbance\r\narose in Tuscany. Certain citizens of Volterra had discovered an\r\nalum-mine in their district, and being aware of the profit derivable\r\nfrom it, in order to obtain the means of working and securing it, they\r\napplied to some Florentines, and allowed them to share in the profits.\r\nThis, as is frequently the case with new undertakings, at first excited\r\nlittle attention from the people of Volterra; but in time, finding\r\nthe profits derived from it had become considerable, they fruitlessly\r\nendeavored to effect what at first might have been easily accomplished.\r\nThey began by agitating the question in their councils, declaring it\r\ngrossly improper that a source of wealth discovered in the public lands\r\nshould be converted to the emolument of private individuals. They\r\nnext sent advocates to Florence, and the question was referred to the\r\nconsideration of certain citizens, who, either through being bribed by\r\nthe party in possession, or from a sincere conviction, declared the\r\naim of the people of Volterra to be unjust in desiring to deprive their\r\ncitizens of the fruit of their labor; and decided that the alum-pit was\r\nthe rightful property of those who had hitherto wrought it; but, at\r\nthe same time, recommended them to pay an annual sum by way of\r\nacknowledgment to the city. This answer instead of abating, served only\r\nto increase the animosities and tumult in Volterra, and absorbed entire\r\nattention both in the councils and throughout the city; the people\r\ndemanding the restitution of what they considered their due, and\r\nthe proprietors insisting upon their right to retain what they had\r\noriginally acquired, and what had been subsequently been confirmed\r\nto them by the decision of the Florentines. In the midst of these\r\ndisturbances, a respectable citizen, named Il Pecorino, was killed,\r\ntogether with several others, who had embraced the same side, whose\r\nhouses were also plundered and burned; and the fury of the mob rose to\r\nsuch a height, that they were with difficulty restrained from putting\r\nthe Florentine rectors to death.\r\n\r\nAfter the first outrage, the Volterrani immediately determined to send\r\nambassadors to Florence, who intimated, that if the Signory would allow\r\nthem their ancient privileges, the city would remain subject to them as\r\nformerly. Many and various were the opinions concerning the reply to be\r\nmade. Tommaso Soderini advised that they should accept the submission\r\nof the people of Volterra, upon any conditions with which they were\r\ndisposed to make it; for he considered it unreasonable and unwise to\r\nkindle a flame so near home that it might burn their own dwelling; he\r\nsuspected the pope's ambition, and was apprehensive of the power of the\r\nking; nor could he confide in the friendship either of the duke or the\r\nVenetians, having no assurance of the sincerity of the latter, or the\r\nvalor of the former. He concluded by quoting that trite proverb, \"Meglio\r\nun magro accordo che una grassa vittoria.\"[*] On the other hand, Lorenzo\r\nde' Medici, thinking this an opportunity for exhibiting his prudence\r\nand wisdom, and being strenuously supported by those who envied the\r\ninfluence of Tommaso Soderini, resolved to march against them, and\r\npunish the arrogance of the people of Volterra with arms; declaring\r\nthat if they were not made a striking example, others would, without\r\nthe least fear or respect, upon every slight occasion, adopt a similar\r\ncourse. The enterprise being resolved on, the Volterrani were told that\r\nthey could not demand the observance of conditions which they themselves\r\nhad broken, and therefore must either submit to the direction of the\r\nSignory or expect war. With this answer they returned to their city, and\r\nprepared for its defense; fortifying the place, and sending to all the\r\nprinces of Italy to request assistance, none of whom listened to them,\r\nexcept the Siennese and the lord of Piombino, who gave them some hope\r\nof aid. The Florentines on the other hand, thinking success dependent\r\nprincipally upon celerity, assembled ten thousand foot and two thousand\r\nhorse, who, under the command of Federigo, lord of Urbino, marched into\r\nthe country of Volterra and quickly took entire possession of it. They\r\nthen encamped before the city, which, being in a lofty situation, and\r\nprecipitous on all sides, could only be approached by a narrow pass\r\nnear the church of St. Alessandro. The Volterrani had engaged for\r\ntheir defense about one thousand mercenaries, who, perceiving the great\r\nsuperiority of the Florentines, found the place untenable, and were\r\ntardy in their defensive operations, but indefatigable in the constant\r\ninjuries they committed upon the people of the place. Thus these poor\r\ncitizens were harassed by the enemy without, and by their own soldiery\r\nwithin; so, despairing of their safety, they began to think of a\r\ncapitulation; and, being unable to obtain better terms, submitted to the\r\ndiscretion of the Florentine commissaries, who ordered the gates to\r\nbe opened, and introduced the greater part of their forces. They then\r\nproceeded to the palace, and commanded the priors to retire to their\r\nhomes; and, on the way thither, one of them was in derision stripped\r\nby the soldiers. From this beginning (so much more easily are men\r\npredisposed to evil than to good) originated the pillage and destruction\r\nof the city; which for a whole day suffered the greatest horrors,\r\nneither women nor sacred places being spared; and the soldiery, those\r\nengaged for its defense as well as its assailants, plundered all that\r\ncame within their reach. The news of this victory was received with\r\ngreat joy at Florence, and as the expedition had been undertaken wholly\r\nby the advice of Lorenzo, he acquired great reputation. Upon which one\r\nof the intimate friends of Tommaso Soderini, reminding him of the advice\r\nhe had given, asked him what he thought of the taking of Volterra; to\r\nwhich he replied, \"To me the place seems rather lost than won; for had\r\nit been received on equitable terms, advantage and security would have\r\nbeen the result; but having to retain it by force it will in critical\r\njunctures, occasion weakness and anxiety, and in times of peace, injury\r\nand expense.\"\r\n\r\n     [*] A lean peace is better than a fat victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nOrigin of the animosity between Sixtus IV. and Lorenzo de' Medici--Carlo\r\ndi Braccio da Perugia attacks the Siennese--Carlo retires by desire\r\nof the Florentines--Conspiracy against Galeazzo, duke of Milan--His\r\nvices--He is slain by the conspirators--Their deaths.\r\n\r\nThe pope, anxious to retain the territories of the church in obedience,\r\nhad caused Spoleto to be sacked for having, through internal factions,\r\nfallen into rebellion. Citta di Castello being in the same state of\r\ncontumacy, he besieged that place; and Niccolo Vitelli its prince, being\r\non intimate terms with Lorenzo de' Medici, obtained assistance from\r\nhim, which, though inadequate, was quite enough to originate that enmity\r\nbetween Sixtus IV. and the Medici afterward productive of such unhappy\r\nresults. Nor would this have been so long in development had not the\r\ndeath of Frate Piero, cardinal of St. Sixtus, taken place; who, after\r\nhaving traveled over Italy and visited Venice and Milan (under the\r\npretense of doing honor to the marriage of Ercole, marquis of Ferrara),\r\nwent about sounding the minds of the princes, to learn how they were\r\ndisposed toward the Florentines. But upon his return he died, not\r\nwithout suspicion of having been poisoned by the Venetians, who found\r\nthey would have reason to fear Sixtus if he were allowed to avail\r\nhimself of the talents and exertions of Frate Piero. Although of very\r\nlow extraction, and meanly brought up within the walls of a convent,\r\nhe had no sooner attained the distinction of the scarlet hat, than\r\nhe exhibited such inordinate pride and ambition, that the pontificate\r\nseemed too little for him, and he gave a feast in Rome which would\r\nhave seemed extraordinary even for a king, the expense exceeding twenty\r\nthousand florins. Deprived of this minister, the designs of Sixtus\r\nproceeded with less promptitude. The Florentines, the duke, and the\r\nVenetians having renewed their league, and allowed the pope and the king\r\nto join them if they thought proper, the two latter also entered into\r\na league, reserving an opening for the others if they were desirous\r\nto become parties to it. Italy was thus divided in two factions; for\r\ncircumstances daily arose which occasioned ill feeling between the two\r\nleagues; as occurred with respect to the island of Cyprus, to which\r\nFerrando laid claim, and the Venetians occupied. Thus the pope and the\r\nking became more closely united. Federigo, prince of Urbino, was at\r\nthis time one of the first generals of Italy; and had long served the\r\nFlorentines. In order, if possible, to deprive the hostile league of\r\ntheir captain, the pope advised, and the king requested him to pay\r\na visit to them. To the surprise and displeasure of the Florentines,\r\nFederigo complied; for they thought the same fate awaited him as had\r\nbefallen Niccolo Piccinino. However, the result was quite different;\r\nfor he returned from Naples and Rome greatly honored, and with the\r\nappointment of general to their forces. They also endeavored to gain\r\nover to their interest the lords of Romagna and the Siennese, that they\r\nmight more easily injure the Florentines, who, becoming aware of these\r\nthings, used their utmost endeavors to defend themselves against the\r\nambition of their enemies; and having lost Federigo d'Urbino, they\r\nengaged Roberto da Rimino in his place, renewed the league with the\r\nPerugini and formed one with the prince of Faenza. The pope and the king\r\nassigned, as the reasons of their animosity against the Florentines,\r\nthat they wished to withdraw them from the Venetian alliance, and\r\nassociate them with their own league; for the pope did not think the\r\nchurch could maintain her reputation, nor the Count Girolamo retain\r\nthe states of Romagna, while the Florentines and the Venetians remained\r\nunited. The Florentines conjectured their design was to set them at\r\nenmity with the Venetians, not so much for the sake of gaining their\r\nfriendship as to be able the more easily to injure them. Two years\r\npassed away in these jealousies and discontents before any disturbance\r\nbroke out; but the first which occurred, and that but trivial, took\r\nplace in Tuscany.\r\n\r\nBraccio of Perugia, whom we have frequently mentioned as one of the\r\nmost distinguished warriors of Italy, left two sons, Oddo and Carlo; the\r\nlatter was of tender years; the former, as above related, was slain by\r\nthe people of Val di Lamona; but Carlo, when he came to mature age, was\r\nby the Venetians, out of respect for the memory of his father, and the\r\nhopes they entertained from himself, received among the condottieri of\r\ntheir republic. The term of his engagement having expired, he did not\r\ndesign to renew it immediately, but resolved to try if, by his own\r\ninfluence and his father's reputation, he could recover possession of\r\nPerugia. To this the Venetians willingly consented, for they usually\r\nextended their dominion by any changes that occurred in the neighboring\r\nstates. Carlo consequently came into Tuscany, but found more\r\ndifficulties in his attempt upon Perugia than he had anticipated, on\r\naccount of its being allied with the Florentines; and desirous of doing\r\nsomething worthy of memory, he made war upon the Siennese, alleging\r\nthem to be indebted to him for services performed by his father in the\r\naffairs of that republic, and attacked them with such impetuosity as to\r\nthreaten the total overthrow of their dominion. The Siennese, ever ready\r\nto suspect the Florentines, persuaded themselves that this outrage had\r\nbeen committed with their cognizance, and made heavy complaints to the\r\npope and the king against them. They also sent ambassadors to Florence\r\nto complain of the injuries they had suffered, and adroitly intimated,\r\nthat if Carlo had not been secretly supported he could not have made\r\nwar upon them with such perfect security. The Florentines denied all\r\nparticipation in the proceedings of Carlo, expressed their most earnest\r\nwish to do everything in their power to put a stop to them, and allowed\r\nthe ambassadors to use whatever terms they pleased in the name of\r\nthe Signory, to command him to desist. Carlo complained that the\r\nFlorentines, by their unwillingness to support him, had deprived\r\nthemselves of a most valuable acquisition and him of great glory; for he\r\ncould have insured them the possession of the whole territory in a\r\nshort time, from the want of courage in the people and the ineffectual\r\nprovision they had made for their defense. He then withdrew to his\r\nengagement under the Venetians; but the Siennese, although delivered\r\nfrom such imminent peril by the Florentines, were still very indignant\r\nagainst them; considering themselves under no obligation to those who\r\nhad delivered them from an evil to which they had first exposed them.\r\n\r\nWhile the transactions between the king and the pope were in progress,\r\nand those in Tuscany in the manner we have related, an event of greater\r\nimportance occurred in Lombardy. Cola Montano, a learned and ambitious\r\nman, taught the Latin language to the youth of the principal families in\r\nMilan. Either out of hatred to the character and manners of the duke, or\r\nfrom some other cause, he constantly deprecated the condition of those\r\nwho live under a bad prince; calling those glorious and happy who had\r\nthe good fortune to be born and live in a republic. He endeavored to\r\nshow that the most celebrated men had been produced in republics, and\r\nnot reared under princes; that the former cherish virtue, while the\r\nlatter destroy it; the one deriving advantage from virtuous men,\r\nwhile the latter naturally fear them. The youths with whom he was most\r\nintimate were Giovanni Andrea Lampognano, Carlo Visconti, and Girolamo\r\nOgliato. He frequently discussed with them the faults of their prince,\r\nand the wretched condition of those who were subject to him; and by\r\nconstantly inculcating his principles, acquired such an ascendancy over\r\ntheir minds as to induce them to bind themselves by oath to effect the\r\nduke's destruction, as soon as they became old enough to attempt it.\r\nTheir minds being fully occupied with this design, which grew with\r\ntheir years, the duke's conduct and their own private injuries served to\r\nhasten its execution. Galeazzo was licentious and cruel, of both which\r\nvices he had given such repeated proofs, that he became odious to all.\r\nNot content with corrupting the wives of the nobility, he also took\r\npleasure in making it notorious; nor was he satisfied with murdering\r\nindividuals unless he effected their deaths by some unusual cruelty. He\r\nwas suspected of having destroyed his own mother; for, not considering\r\nhimself prince while she was present, he conducted himself in such a\r\nmanner as induced her to withdraw from his court, and, travelling toward\r\nCremona, which she obtained as part of her marriage portion, she was\r\nseized with a sudden illness, and died upon the road; which made many\r\nthink her son had caused her death. The duke had dishonored both Carlo\r\nand Girolamo in respect to their wives or other female relatives, and\r\nhad refused to concede to Giovanandrea possession of the monastery of\r\nMiramondo, of which he had obtained a grant from the pope for a near\r\nrelative. These private injuries increased the young men's desire for\r\nvengeance, and the deliverance of their country from so many evils;\r\ntrusting that whenever they should succeed in destroying the duke, many\r\nof the nobility and all the people would rise in their defense. Being\r\nresolved upon their undertaking, they were often together, which, on\r\naccount of their long intimacy, did not excite any suspicion. They\r\nfrequently discussed the subject; and in order to familiarize their\r\nminds with the deed itself, they practiced striking each other in the\r\nbreast and in the side with the sheathed daggers intended to be used for\r\nthe purpose. On considering the most suitable time and place, the castle\r\nseemed insecure; during the chase, uncertain and dangerous; while going\r\nabout the city for his own amusement, difficult if not impracticable;\r\nand, at a banquet, of doubtful result. They, therefore, determined to\r\nkill him upon the occasion of some procession or public festivity when\r\nthere would be no doubt of his presence, and where they might, under\r\nvarious pretexts, assemble their friends. It was also resolved that\r\nif one of their number were prevented from attending, on any account\r\nwhatever, the rest should put him to death in the midst of their armed\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nIt was now the close of the year 1476, near Christmas, and as it was\r\ncustomary for the duke to go upon St. Stephen's day, in great solemnity,\r\nto the church of that martyr, they considered this the most suitable\r\nopportunity for the execution of their design. Upon the morning of that\r\nday they ordered some of their most trusty friends and servants to arm,\r\ntelling them they wished to go to the assistance of Giovanandrea,\r\nwho, contrary to the wish of some of his neighbors, intended to turn a\r\nwatercourse into his estate; but that before they went they wished to\r\ntake leave of the prince. They also assembled, under various\r\npretenses, other friends and relatives, trusting that when the deed\r\nwas accomplished, everyone would join them in the completion of their\r\nenterprise. It was their intention, after the duke's death, to collect\r\ntheir followers together and proceed to those parts of the city where\r\nthey imagined the plebeians would be most disposed to take arms against\r\nthe duchess and the principal ministers of state, and they thought the\r\npeople, on account of the famine which then prevailed, would easily be\r\ninduced to follow them; for it was their design to give up the houses of\r\nCecco Simonetta, Giovanni Botti, and Francesco Lucani, all leading men\r\nin the government, to be plundered, and by this means gain over the\r\npopulace and restore liberty to the community. With these ideas, and\r\nwith minds resolved upon their execution, Giovanandrea, together with\r\nthe rest, were early at the church, and heard mass together; after\r\nwhich, Giovanandrea, turning to a statue of St. Ambrose, said, \"O patron\r\nof our city! thou knowest our intention, and the end we would attain,\r\nby so many dangers; favor our enterprise, and prove, by protecting the\r\noppressed, that tyranny is offensive to thee.\" To the duke, on the other\r\nhand, when intending to go to the church, many omens occurred of his\r\napproaching death; for in the morning, having put on a cuirass, as was\r\nhis frequent custom, he immediately took it off again, either because\r\nit inconvenienced him, or that he did not like its appearance. He\r\nthen wished to hear mass in the castle, and found that the priest who\r\nofficiated in the chapel had gone to St. Stephen's, and had taken with\r\nhim the sacred utensils. On this he desired the service to be performed\r\nby the bishop of Como, who acquainted him with preventing circumstances.\r\nThus, almost compelled, he determined to go to the church; but before\r\nhis departure, caused his sons, Giovan Galeazzo and Ermes, to be brought\r\nto him, whom he embraced and kissed several times, seeming reluctant to\r\npart with them. He then left the castle, and, with the ambassadors\r\nof Ferrara and Mantua on either hand, proceeded to St. Stephen's. The\r\nconspirators, to avoid exciting suspicion, and to escape the cold, which\r\nwas very severe, had withdrawn to an apartment of the archpriest, who\r\nwas a friend of theirs, but hearing the duke's approach, they came into\r\nthe church, Giovanandrea and Girolamo placing themselves upon the\r\nright hand of the entrance, and Carlo on the left. Those who led\r\nthe procession had already entered, and were followed by the duke,\r\nsurrounded by such a multitude as is usual on similar occasions. The\r\nfirst attack was made by Lampognano and Girolamo, who, pretending to\r\nclear the way for the prince, came close to him, and grasping their\r\ndaggers, which, being short and sharp, were concealed in the sleeves of\r\ntheir vests, struck at him. Lampognano gave him two wounds, one in the\r\nbelly, the other in the throat. Girolamo struck him in the throat and\r\nbreast. Carlo Visconti, being nearer the door, and the duke having\r\npassed, could not wound him in front: but with two strokes,\r\ntranspierced his shoulder and spine. These six wounds were inflicted\r\nso instantaneously, that the duke had fallen before anyone was aware of\r\nwhat had happened, and he expired, having only once ejaculated the\r\nname of the Virgin, as if imploring her assistance. A great tumult\r\nimmediately ensued, several swords were drawn, and as often happens in\r\nsudden emergencies, some fled from the church, and others ran toward the\r\nscene of tumult, both without any definite motive or knowledge of what\r\nhad occurred. Those, however, who were nearest the duke and had seen\r\nhim slain, recognizing the murderers, pursued them. Giovanandrea,\r\nendeavoring to make his way out of the church, proceeded among the\r\nwomen, who being numerous, and according to their custom, seated upon\r\nthe ground, was prevented in his progress by their apparel, and being\r\novertaken, he was killed by a Moor, one of the duke's footmen. Carlo was\r\nslain by those immediately around him. Girolamo Olgiato passed through\r\nthe crowd, and got out of the church; but seeing his companions dead,\r\nand not knowing where else to go, he proceeded home, where his father\r\nand brothers refused to receive him; his mother only, having compassion\r\non her son recommended him to a priest, an old friend of the family,\r\nwho, disguising him in his own apparel, led him to his house. Here he\r\nremained two days, not without hope that some disturbance might arise\r\nin Milan which would contribute to his safety. This not occurring, and\r\napprehensive that his hiding place would be discovered, he endeavored\r\nto escape in disguise, but being observed, he was given over to justice,\r\nand disclosed all the particulars of the conspiracy. Girolamo was\r\ntwenty-three years of age, and exhibited no less composure at his death\r\nthan resolution in his previous conduct, for being stripped of his\r\napparel, and in the hands of the executioner, who stood by with\r\nthe sword unsheathed, ready to deprive him of life, he repeated the\r\nfollowing words, in the Latin tongue, in which he was well versed: \"Mors\r\nacerba, fama perpetua, stabit vetus memoria facti.\"\r\n\r\nThe enterprise of these unfortunate young men was conducted with secrecy\r\nand executed with resolution; and they failed for want of the support\r\nof those whom they expected would rise in their defense. Let princes\r\ntherefore learn to live, so as to render themselves beloved and\r\nrespected by their subjects, that none may have hope of safety after\r\nhaving destroyed them; and let others see how vain is the expectation\r\nwhich induces them to trust so much to the multitude, as to believe,\r\nthat even when discontented, they will either embrace or ward off their\r\ndangers. This event spread consternation all over Italy; but those\r\nwhich shortly afterward occurred in Florence caused much more alarm, and\r\nterminated a peace of twelve years' continuance, as will be shown in the\r\nfollowing book; which, having commenced with blood and horror, will have\r\na melancholy and tearful conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nState of the family of the Medici at Florence--Enmity of Sixtus IV.\r\ntoward Florence--Differences between the family of the Pazzi and that\r\nof the Medici--Beginning of the conspiracy of the Pazzi--Arrangements to\r\neffect the design of the conspiracy--Giovanni Batista da Montesecco\r\nis sent to Florence--The pope joins the conspiracy--The king of Naples\r\nbecomes a party to it--Names of the conspirators--The conspirators make\r\nmany ineffectual attempts to kill Lorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici--The\r\nfinal arrangement--Order of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThis book, commencing between two conspiracies, the one at Milan already\r\nnarrated, the other yet to be recorded, it would seem appropriate, and\r\nin accordance with our usual custom, were we to treat of the nature and\r\nimportance of these terrible demonstrations. This we should willingly do\r\nhad we not discussed the matter elsewhere, or could it be comprised in\r\nfew words. But requiring much consideration, and being already noticed\r\nin another place, it will be omitted, and we shall proceed with our\r\nnarrative. The government of the Medici having subdued all its avowed\r\nenemies in order to obtain for that family undivided authority, and\r\ndistinguish them from other citizens in their relation to the rest,\r\nfound it necessary to subdue those who secretly plotted against them.\r\nWhile Medici contended with other families, their equals in authority\r\nand reputation, those who envied their power were able to oppose them\r\nopenly without danger of being suppressed at the first demonstration of\r\nhostility; for the magistrates being free, neither party had occasion to\r\nfear, till one or other of them was overcome. But after the victory of\r\n1466, the government became so entirely centred in the Medici, and\r\nthey acquired so much authority, that discontented spirits were obliged\r\neither to suffer in silence, or, if desirous to destroy them, to attempt\r\nit in secrecy, and by clandestine means; which plots rarely succeed and\r\nmost commonly involve the ruin of those concerned in them, while they\r\nfrequently contribute to the aggrandizement of those against whom they\r\nare directed. Thus the prince of a city attacked by a conspiracy, if\r\nnot slain like the duke of Milan (which seldom happens), almost always\r\nattains to a greater degree of power, and very often has his good\r\ndisposition perverted to evil. The proceedings of his enemies give him\r\ncause for fear; fear suggests the necessity of providing for his\r\nown safety, which involves the injury of others; and hence arise\r\nanimosities, and not unfrequently his ruin. Thus these conspiracies\r\nquickly occasion the destruction of their contrivers, and, in time,\r\ninevitably injure their primary object.\r\n\r\nItaly, as we have seen above, was divided into two factions; the pope\r\nand the king on one side; on the other, the Venetians, the duke, and the\r\nFlorentines. Although the flames of war had not yet broken out, every\r\nday gave rise to some new occasion for rekindling them; and the pope,\r\nin particular, in all his plans endeavored to annoy the Florentine\r\ngovernment. Thus Filippo de' Medici, archbishop of Pisa, being dead,\r\nFrancesco Salviati, a declared enemy of the Medici, was appointed his\r\nsuccessor, contrary to the wish of the Signory of Florence, who being\r\nunwilling to give him possession, there arose between them and the pope\r\nmany fresh grounds of offense, before the matter was settled. Besides\r\nthis, he conferred, at Rome, many favors upon the family of the Pazzi,\r\nand opposed that of the Medici, whenever an opportunity offered. The\r\nPazzi were at this time, both on account of nobility of birth and their\r\ngreat wealth, the most brilliant in France. The head of this family was\r\nJacopo, whom the people, on account of his distinguished pre-eminence,\r\nhad made a knight. He had no children, except one natural daughter, but\r\nmany nephews, sons of his brothers Piero and Antonio, the first of whom\r\nwere Guglielmo, Francesco, Rinato, Giovanni, and then, Andrea, Niccolo,\r\nand Galeotto. Cosmo de' Medici, noticing the riches and rank of this\r\nfamily, had given his granddaughter, Bianca, to Guglielmo, hoping\r\nby this marriage to unite the houses, and obviate those enmities and\r\ndissensions so frequently occasioned by jealousy. However (so uncertain\r\nand fallacious are our expectations), very different feelings were thus\r\noriginated; for Lorenzo's advisers pointed out to him how dangerous\r\nit was, and how injurious to his authority, to unite in the same\r\nindividuals so much wealth and power. In consequence, neither Jacopo\r\nnor his nephews obtained those degrees of honor, which in the opinion of\r\nother citizens were their due. This gave rise to anger in the Pazzi, and\r\nfear on the part of the Medici; as the former of these increased, so did\r\nthe latter; and upon all occasions, when the Pazzi came in competition\r\nwith other citizens, their claims to distinction, however strong, were\r\nset aside by the magistracy. Francesco de' Pazzi, being at Rome, the\r\nCouncil of Eight, upon some trivial occasion, compelled him to return,\r\nwithout treating him with the respect usually observed toward great\r\ncitizens, so that the Pazzi everywhere bitterly complained of the\r\nill usage they experienced, and thus excited suspicion in others, and\r\nbrought down greater evils upon themselves. Giovanni de' Pazzi had\r\nmarried the daughter of Giovanni Buonromei, a very wealthy man, whose\r\nriches on his decease, without other children, came to his daughter. His\r\nnephew, Carlo, however, took possession of part, and the question being\r\nlitigated, a law was passed, by virtue of which the wife of Giovanni de'\r\nPazzi was robbed of her inheritance, and it was given to Carlo. In this\r\npiece of injustice the Pazzi at once recognized the influence of the\r\nMedici. Giuliano de' Medici often complained to his brother Lorenzo of\r\nthe affair, saying he was afraid that by grasping at too much they would\r\nlose all.\r\n\r\nLorenzo, flushed with youth and power, would assume the direction of\r\neverything, and resolved that all transactions should bear an impress\r\nof his influence. The Pazzi, with their nobility and wealth unable to\r\nendure so many affronts, began to devise some means of vengeance. The\r\nfirst who spoke of any attempt against the Medici, was Francesco, who,\r\nbeing more sensitive and resolute than the others, determined either to\r\nobtain what was withheld from him, or lose what he still possessed. As\r\nthe government of Florence gave him great offense, he resided almost\r\nconstantly at Rome, where, like other Florentine merchants, he conducted\r\nextensive commercial operations; and being a most intimate friend of\r\nCount Girolamo, they frequently complained to each other of the conduct\r\nof the Medici. After a while they began to think that for the count to\r\nretain his estates, or the Pazzi their rights in the city, it would be\r\nnecessary to change the government of Florence; and this they considered\r\ncould not be done without the death of Giuliano and Lorenzo. They\r\nimagined the pope and the king would be easily induced to consent,\r\nbecause each could be convinced of the facility of the enterprise.\r\nHaving acquired these ideas, they communicated them to Francesco\r\nSalviati, archbishop of Pisa, who, being ambitious and recently offended\r\nby the Medici, willingly adopted their views. Considering their next\r\nstep, they resolved, in order to facilitate the design, to obtain the\r\nconsent of Jacopo de' Pazzi, without whose concurrence they feared it\r\nwould be impracticable. With this view, it was resolved that Francesco\r\nde' Pazzi should go to Florence, while the archbishop and the count\r\nwere to remain at Rome, to be ready to communicate with the pope when\r\na suitable opportunity occurred. Francesco found Jacopo de' Pazzi more\r\ncautious and difficult to persuade than he could have wished, and on\r\nimparting this to his friends at Rome, it was thought he desired the\r\nsanction of some greater authority to induce him to adopt their views.\r\nUpon this, the archbishop and the count communicated the whole affair to\r\nGiovanni Batista da Montesecco, a leader of the papal forces, possessing\r\nmilitary reputation, and under obligations to the pope and the count.\r\nTo him the affair seemed difficult and dangerous, while the archbishop\r\nendeavored to obviate his objections by showing how much assistance\r\nthe pope and the king would lend to the enterprise; the hatred of the\r\nFlorentines toward the Medici, the numerous friends the Salviati and\r\nthe Pazzi would bring with them, the readiness with which the young men\r\nmight be slain, on account of their going about the city unaccompanied\r\nand without suspicion, and the facility with which the government\r\nmight then be changed. These things Giovanni Batista did not in\r\nreality believe, for he had heard from many Florentines quite contrary\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nWhile occupied with these deliberations, Carlo, lord of Faenza, was\r\ntaken ill, and tears were entertained for his life. This circumstance\r\nseemed to the archbishop and the count to offer an opportunity for\r\nsending Giovanni Batista to Florence, and thence to Romagna, under\r\npretence of recovering certain territories belonging to the latter,\r\nof which the lord of Faenza had taken possession. The count therefore\r\ncommissioned Giovanni Batista to have an interview with Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici, and on his part request his advice how to proceed with respect\r\nto the affair of Romagna; that he should then see Francesco de' Pazzi,\r\nand in conjunction with him endeavor to induce his uncle Jacopo to adopt\r\ntheir ideas. To render the pope's authority available in their behalf,\r\nGiovanni Batista was ordered, before his departure, to communicate with\r\nthe pontiff, who offered every means at his disposal in favor of their\r\nenterprise. Giovanni Batista, having arrived at Florence, obtained an\r\ninterview with Lorenzo, by whom he was most graciously received; and\r\nwith regard to the advice he was commissioned to ask, obtained a wise\r\nand friendly answer; so that he was astonished at finding him quite a\r\ndifferent character from what he had been represented, and considered\r\nhim to possess great sagacity, an affectionate heart, and most amicably\r\ndisposed toward the count. He found Francesco de' Pazzi had gone to\r\nLucca, and spoke to Jacopo, who was at first quite opposed to their\r\ndesign, but before they parted the pope's authority seemed to have\r\ninfluenced him; for he told Giovanni Batista, that he might go to\r\nRomagna, and that before his return Francesco would be with him, and\r\nthey would then consult more particularly upon the subject. Giovanni\r\nBatista proceeded to Romagna, and soon returned to Florence. After\r\na pretended consultation with Lorenzo, upon the count's affairs, he\r\nobtained an interview with Francesco and Jacopo de' Pazzi, when the\r\nlatter gave his consent to their enterprise. They then discussed the\r\nmeans of carrying it into effect. Jacopo de' Pazzi was of opinion that\r\nit could not be effected while both the brothers remained at Florence;\r\nand therefore it would be better to wait till Lorenzo went to Rome,\r\nwhither it was reported he had an intention of going; for then their\r\nobject would be more easily attained. Francesco de' Pazzi had no\r\nobjection to Lorenzo being at Rome, but if he were to forego the\r\njourney, he thought that both the brothers might be slain, either at\r\na marriage, or at a play, or in a church. With regard to foreign\r\nassistance, he supposed the pope might assemble forces for the conquest\r\nof the fortress of Montone, being justified in taking it from Count\r\nCarlo, who had caused the tumults already spoken of in Sienna and\r\nPerugia.\r\n\r\nStill no definite arrangement was made; but it was resolved that\r\nGiovanni Batista and Francesco de' Pazzi should go to Rome and settle\r\neverything with the pontiff. The matter was again debated at Rome; and\r\nat length it was concluded that besides an expedition against Montone,\r\nGiovan Francesco da Tolentino, a leader of the papal troops, should go\r\ninto Romagna, and Lorenzo da Castello to the Val di Tavere; that each,\r\nwith the forces of the country, should hold himself in readiness to\r\nperform the commands of the archbishop de' Salviati and Francesco\r\nde Pazzi, both of whom were to come to Florence, and provide for the\r\nexecution of their design, with the assistance of Giovanni Batista da\r\nMontesecco. King Ferrando promised, by his ambassador, to contribute all\r\nin his power to the success of their undertaking. Francesco de' Pazzi\r\nand the archbishop having arrived at Florence, prevailed upon Jacopo\r\ndi Poggio, a well educated youth, but ambitious and very desirous\r\nof change, to join them, and two others, each of the name of Jacopo\r\nSalviati, one a brother, the other a kinsman, of the archbishop. They\r\nalso gained over Bernardo Bandini and Napoleone Franzeni, two bold young\r\nmen, under great obligations to the family of the Pazzi. Besides those\r\nalready mentioned, they were joined by Antonio da Volterra and a priest\r\nnamed Stefano, who taught Latin to the daughter of Jacopo de' Pazzi.\r\nRinato de' Pazzi, a grave and prudent man, being quite aware of the\r\nevils resulting from such undertakings, refused all participation in the\r\nconspiracy; he held it in abhorrence, and as much as possible, without\r\nbetraying his kinsmen, endeavored to counteract it.\r\n\r\nThe pope had sent Raffaello di Riario, a nephew of Count Girolamo, to\r\nthe college of Pisa, to study canon law, and while there, had advanced\r\nhim to the dignity of a cardinal. The conspirators determined to bring\r\nthis cardinal to Florence, as they would thus be better able to conceal\r\ntheir design, since any persons requisite to be introduced into the city\r\nmight easily be made to appear as a part of his retinue, and his arrival\r\nmight facilitate the completion of their enterprise. The cardinal came,\r\nand was received by Jacopo de' Pazzi at his villa of Montughi, near\r\nFlorence. By his means it was also intended to bring together Giuliano\r\nand Lorenzo, and whenever this happened, to put them both to death. They\r\ntherefore invited them to meet the cardinal at their villa of Fiesole;\r\nbut Giuliano, either intentionally or through some preventing cause, did\r\nnot attend; and this design having failed, they thought that if asked to\r\nan entertainment at Florence, both brothers would certainly be present.\r\nWith this intention they appointed Sunday, the twenty-sixth of April,\r\n1478, to give a great feast; and, resolving to assassinate them at\r\ntable, the conspirators met on the Saturday evening to arrange all\r\nproceedings for the following day. In the morning it was intimated to\r\nFrancesco that Giuliano would be absent; on which the conspirators again\r\nassembled and finding they could no longer defer the execution of their\r\ndesign, since it would be impossible among so many to preserve secrecy,\r\nthey determined to complete it in the cathedral church of Santa\r\nReparata, where the cardinal attending, the two brothers would be\r\npresent as usual. They wished Giovanni Batista da Montesecco to\r\nundertake the murder of Lorenzo, while that of Giuliano was assigned\r\nto Francesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini. Giovanni Batista refused,\r\neither because his familiarity with Lorenzo had created feelings in his\r\nfavor, or from some other reason, saying he should not have resolution\r\nsufficient to commit such a deed in a church, and thus add sacrilege\r\nto treachery. This caused the failure of their undertaking; for time\r\npressing, they were compelled to substitute Antonio da Volterra and\r\nStefano, the priest, two men, who, from nature and habit, were the most\r\nunsuitable of any; for if firmness and resolution joined with experience\r\nin bloodshed be necessary upon any occasion, it is on such as these; and\r\nit often happens that those who are expert in arms, and have faced death\r\nin all forms on the field of battle, still fail in an affair like this.\r\nHaving now decided upon the time, they resolved that the signal for the\r\nattack should be the moment when the priest who celebrated high\r\nmass should partake of the sacrament, and that, in the meantime, the\r\nArchbishop de' Salviati, with his followers, and Jacopo di Poggio,\r\nshould take possession of the palace, in order that the Signory, after\r\nthe young men's death, should voluntarily, or by force, contribute to\r\ntheir assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGiuliano de' Medici slain--Lorenzo escapes--The archbishop Salviati\r\nendeavors to seize the palace of the Signory--He is taken\r\nand hanged--The enterprise of the conspirators entirely\r\nfails--Manifestations of the Florentines in favor of Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici--The conspirators punished--The funeral of Giuliano--The pope\r\nand the king of Naples make war upon the Florentines--Florence\r\nexcommunicated--Speech of Lorenzo de' Medici to the citizens of\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators proceeded to Santa Reparata, where the cardinal and\r\nLorenzo had already arrived. The church was crowded, and divine service\r\ncommenced before Giuliano's arrival. Francesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo\r\nBandini, who were appointed to be his murderers, went to his house,\r\nand finding him, they, by earnest entreaties, prevailed upon him to\r\naccompany them. It is surprising that such intense hatred, and designs\r\nso full of horror as those of Francesco and Bernardo, could be so\r\nperfectly concealed; for while conducting him to the church, and after\r\nthey had reached it, they amused him with jests and playful discourse.\r\nNor did Francesco forget, under pretense of endearment, to press him in\r\nhis arms, so as to ascertain whether under his apparel he wore a cuirass\r\nor other means of defense. Giuliano and Lorenzo were both aware of\r\nthe animosity of the Pazzi, and their desire to deprive them of the\r\ngovernment; but they felt assured that any design would be attempted\r\nopenly, and in conjunction with the civil authority. Thus being free\r\nfrom apprehension for their personal safety both affected to be on\r\nfriendly terms with them. The murderers being ready, each in his\r\nappointed station, which they could retain without suspicion, on account\r\nof the vast numbers assembled in the church, the preconcerted moment\r\narrived, and Bernardo Bandini, with a short dagger provided for the\r\npurpose, struck Giuliano in the breast, who, after a few steps, fell to\r\nthe earth. Francesco de' Pazzi threw himself upon the body and covered\r\nhim with wounds; while, as if blinded by rage, he inflicted a deep\r\nincision upon his own leg. Antonio and Stefano, the priest, attacked\r\nLorenzo, and after dealing many blows, effected only a slight incision\r\nin the throat; for either their want of resolution, the activity\r\nof Lorenzo, who, finding himself attacked, used his arms in his own\r\ndefense, or the assistance of those by whom he was surrounded, rendered\r\nall attempts futile. They fled and concealed themselves, but being\r\nsubsequently discovered, were put to death in the most ignominious\r\nmanner, and their bodies dragged about the city. Lorenzo, with the\r\nfriends he had about him, took refuge in the sacristy of the church.\r\nBernardo Bandini, after Giuliano's death, also slew Francesco Nori, a\r\nmost intimate friend of the Medici, either from some previous hatred or\r\nfor having endeavored to render assistance to Giuliano; and not content\r\nwith these murders, he ran in pursuit of Lorenzo, intending, by his own\r\npromptitude, to make up for the weakness and inefficiency of the others;\r\nbut finding he had taken refuge in the vestry, he was prevented.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these violent and fearful deeds, during which the uproar\r\nwas so terrible, that it seemed almost sufficient to bring the church\r\ndown upon its inmates, the cardinal Riario remained close to the altar,\r\nwhere he was with difficulty kept in safety by the priests, until the\r\nSignory, upon the abatement of the disturbance, could conduct him to\r\ntheir palace, where he remained in the utmost terror till he was set at\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThere were at this time in Florence some people of Perugia, whom party\r\nfeuds had compelled to leave their homes; and the Pazzi, by promising to\r\nrestore them to their country, obtained their assistance. The Archbishop\r\nde' Salviati, going to seize the palace, together with Jacopo di Poggio,\r\nand the Salviati, his friends, took these Perugini with him. Having\r\narrived, he left part of his people below, with orders that when they\r\nheard a noise they should make themselves masters of the entrance, while\r\nhimself, with the greater part of the Perugini, proceeded above, and\r\nfinding the Signory at dinner (for it was now late), was admitted\r\nafter a short delay, by Cesare Petrucci, the Gonfalonier of Justice. He\r\nentered with only a few of his followers, the greater part of them being\r\nshut up in the cancelleria into which they had gone, whose doors were so\r\ncontrived, that upon closing they could not be opened from either\r\nside, without the key. The archbishop being with the gonfalonier, under\r\npretense of having something to communicate on the part of the pope,\r\naddressed him in such an incoherent and hesitating manner, that the\r\ngonfalonier at once suspected him, and rushing out of the chamber to\r\ncall assistance, found Jacopo di Poggio, whom he seized by the hair\r\nof the head, and gave into the custody of his attendants. The Signory\r\nhearing the tumult, snatched such arms as they could at the moment\r\nobtain, and all who had gone up with the archbishop, part of them being\r\nshut up, and part overcome with terror, were immediately slain or thrown\r\nalive out of the windows of the palace, at which the archbishop, the\r\ntwo Jacopi Salviati, and Jacopodi Poggio were hanged. Those whom the\r\narchbishop left below, having mastered the guard and taken possession of\r\nthe entrance occupied all the lower floors, so that the citizens, who in\r\nthe uproar, hastened to the palace, were unable to give either advice or\r\nassistance to the Signory.\r\n\r\nFrancesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini, perceiving Lorenzo's escape,\r\nand the principal agent in the enterprise seriously wounded, became\r\nimmediately conscious of the imminent peril of their position. Bernardo,\r\nusing the same energy in his own behalf that had served him against the\r\nMedici, finding all lost, saved himself by flight. Francesco, wounded as\r\nhe was, got to his house, and endeavored to get on horseback, for it had\r\nbeen arranged they should ride through the city and call the people to\r\narms and liberty; but he found himself unable, from the nature of his\r\nwound, and, throwing himself naked upon his bed, begged Jacopo de' Pazzi\r\nto perform the part for which he was himself incapacitated. Jacopo,\r\nthough old and unaccustomed to such business, by way of making a last\r\neffort, mounted his horse, and, with about a hundred armed followers,\r\ncollected without previous preparation, hastened to the piazza of the\r\npalace, and endeavored to assemble adherents by cries of \"people,\" and\r\n\"liberty;\" but the former, having been rendered deaf by the fortune and\r\nliberty of the Medici, the latter was unknown in Florence, and he\r\nfound no followers. The signors, who held the upper part of the palace,\r\nsaluted him with stones and threats. Jacopo, while hesitating, was met\r\nby Giovanni Seristori, his brother-in-law, who upbraided him with the\r\ntroubles he had occasioned, and then advised him to go home, for the\r\npeople and liberty were as dear to other citizens as to himself.\r\nThus deprived of every hope, Lorenzo being alive, Francesco seriously\r\nwounded, and none disposed to follow him, not knowing what to do, he\r\nresolved, if possible, to escape by flight; and, accompanied by those\r\nwhom he had led into the piazza, left Florence with the intention of\r\ngoing into Romagna.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the whole city was roused to arms, and Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici, accompanied by a numerous escort, returned to his house. The\r\npalace was recovered from its assailants, all of whom were either\r\nslain or made prisoners. The name of the Medici echoed everywhere, and\r\nportions of dead bodies were seen borne on spears and scattered through\r\nthe streets; while everyone was transported with rage against the Pazzi,\r\nand pursued them with relentless cruelty. The people took possession\r\nof their houses, and Francesco, naked as they found him, was led to the\r\npalace, and hanged beside the archbishop and the rest. He could not\r\nbe induced, by any injurious words or deeds, to utter a syllable, but\r\nregarding those around with a steady look, he silently sighed. Guglielmo\r\nde' Pazzi, brother-in-law to Lorenzo, fled to the latter's house, and\r\nby his innocence and the intercession of his wife, Bianca, he escaped\r\ndeath. There was not a citizen of any rank whatever who did not, upon\r\nthis occasion, wait upon Lorenzo with an offer of his services; so great\r\nwere the popularity and good fortune which this family had acquired by\r\ntheir liberality and prudence. Rinato de' Pazzi was at his villa when\r\nthe event took place, and on being informed of it, he endeavored to\r\nescape in disguise, but was arrested upon the road and brought to\r\nFlorence. Jacopo de' Pazzi was taken while crossing the mountains\r\nof Romagna, for the inhabitants of these parts having heard what had\r\noccurred, and seeing him in flight, attacked and brought him back to the\r\ncity; nor could he, though he frequently endeavored, prevail with them\r\nto put him to death upon the road. Jacopo and Rinato were condemned\r\nwithin four days after the murder of Giuliano. And though so many deaths\r\nhad been inflicted that the roads were covered with fragments of human\r\nbodies, not one excited a feeling of regret, except that of Rinato; for\r\nhe was considered a wise and good man, and possessed none of the pride\r\nfor which the rest of his family were notorious. As if to mark the event\r\nby some extraordinary circumstance, Jacopo de' Pazzi, after having\r\nbeen buried in the tomb of his ancestors, was disinterred like an\r\nexcommunicated person, and thrown into a hole at the outside of the city\r\nwalls; from this grave he was taken, and with the halter in which he\r\nhad been hanged, his body was dragged naked through the city, and, as\r\nif unfit for sepulture on earth, thrown by the populace into the Arno,\r\nwhose waters were then very high. It was an awful instance of the\r\ninstability of fortune, to see so wealthy a man, possessing the utmost\r\nearthly felicity, brought down to such a depth of misery, such utter\r\nruin and extreme degradation. It is said he had vices, among which were\r\ngaming and profane swearing, to which he was very much addicted; but\r\nthese seem more than balanced by his numerous charities, for he relieved\r\nmany in distress, and bestowed much money for pious uses. It may also\r\nbe recorded in his favor, that upon the Saturday preceding the death\r\nof Giuliano, in order that none might suffer from his misfortunes, he\r\ndischarged all his debts; and whatever property he possessed belonging\r\nto others, either in his own house or his place of business, he was\r\nparticularly careful to return to its owners. Giovanni Batista da\r\nMontesecco, after a long examination, was beheaded; Napoleone Franzesi\r\nescaped punishment by flight; Giulielmo de' Pazzi was banished, and\r\nsuch of his cousins as remained alive were imprisoned in the fortress\r\nof Volterra. The disturbances being over, and the conspirators punished,\r\nthe funeral obsequies of Giuliano were performed amid universal\r\nlamentation; for he possessed all the liberality and humanity that could\r\nbe wished for in one of his high station. He left a natural son, born\r\nsome months after his death, named Giulio, who was endowed with that\r\nvirtue and felicity with which the whole world is now acquainted; and\r\nof which we shall speak at length when we come to our own times, if\r\nGod spare us. The people who had assembled in favor of the Pazzi under\r\nLorenzo da Castello in the Val di Tavere, and under Giovan Francesco\r\nda Tolentino in Romagna, approached Florence, but having heard of the\r\nfailure of the conspiracy, they returned home.\r\n\r\nThe changes desired by the pope and the king in the government of\r\nFlorence, not having taken place, they determined to effect by war what\r\nthey had failed to accomplish by treachery; and both assembled forces\r\nwith all speed to attack the Florentine states; publicly declaring that\r\nthey only wished the citizens to remove Lorenzo de' Medici, who alone\r\nof all the Florentines was their enemy. The king's forces had already\r\npassed the Tronto, and the pope's were in Perugia; and that the citizens\r\nmight feel the effect of spiritual as well as temporal weapons, the\r\npontiff excommunicated and anathematized them. Finding themselves\r\nattacked by so many armies, the Florentines prepared for their defense\r\nwith the utmost care. Lorenzo de' Medici, as the enemy's operations\r\nwere said to be directed against himself alone, resolved first of all to\r\nassemble the Signory, and the most influential citizens, in the\r\npalace, to whom, being above three hundred in number, he spoke as\r\nfollows:--\"Most excellent signors, and you, magnificent citizens, I know\r\nnot whether I have more occasion to weep with you for the events which\r\nhave recently occurred, or to rejoice in the circumstances with which\r\nthey have been attended. Certainly, when I think with what virulence of\r\nunited deceit and hatred I have been attacked, and my brother murdered,\r\nI cannot but mourn and grieve from my heart, from my very soul. Yet when\r\nI consider with what promptitude, anxiety, love, and unanimity of the\r\nwhole city my brother has been avenged and myself defended, I am not\r\nonly compelled to rejoice, but feel myself honored and exalted; for if\r\nexperience has shown me that I had more enemies than I apprehended, it\r\nhas also proved that I possess more warm and resolute friends than I\r\ncould ever have hoped for. I must therefore grieve with you for the\r\ninjuries others have suffered, and rejoice in the attachment you have\r\nexhibited toward myself; but I feel more aggrieved by the injuries\r\ncommitted, since they are so unusual, so unexampled, and (as I trust you\r\nbelieve) so undeserved on our part. Think, magnificent citizens, to what\r\na dreadful point ill fortune has reduced our family, when among friends,\r\namidst our own relatives, nay, in God's holy temple, we have found\r\nour greatest foes. Those who are in danger turn to their friends for\r\nassistance; they call upon their relatives for aid; but we found ours\r\narmed, and resolved on our destruction. Those who are persecuted, either\r\nfrom public or private motives, flee for refuge to the altars; but where\r\nothers are safe, we are assassinated; where parricides and assassins are\r\nsecure, the Medici find their murderers. But God, who has not hitherto\r\nabandoned our house, again saved us, and has undertaken the defense of\r\nour just cause. What injury have we done to justify so intense desire of\r\nour destruction? Certainly those who have shown themselves so much our\r\nenemies, never received any private wrong from us; for, had we wished to\r\ninjure them, they would not have had an opportunity of injuring us. If\r\nthey attribute public grievances to ourselves (supposing any had been\r\ndone to them), they do the greater injustices to you, to this palace,\r\nto the majesty of this government, by assuming that on our account you\r\nwould act unfairly to any of your citizens; and such a supposition, as\r\nwe all know, is contradicted by every view of the circumstances; for\r\nwe, had we been able, and you, had we wished it, would never have\r\ncontributed to so abominable a design. Whoever inquires into the truth\r\nof these matters, will find that our family has always been exalted\r\nby you, and from this sole cause, that we have endeavored by kindness,\r\nliberality, and beneficence, to do good to all; and if we have honored\r\nstrangers, when did we ever injure our relatives? If our enemies'\r\nconduct has been adopted, to gratify their desire for power (as would\r\nseem to be the case from their having taken possession of the palace and\r\nbrought an armed force into the piazza), the infamous, ambitious, and\r\ndetestable motive is at once disclosed. If they were actuated by envy\r\nand hatred of our authority, they offend you rather than us; for from\r\nyou we have derived all the influence we possess. Certainly usurped\r\npower deserves to be detested; but not distinctions conceded for acts of\r\nkindness, generosity, and magnificence. And you all know that our family\r\nnever attained any rank to which this palace and your united consent did\r\nnot raise it. Cosmo, my grandfather, did not return from exile with arms\r\nand violence, but by your unanimous desire and approbation. It was not\r\nmy father, old and inform, who defended the government against so many\r\nenemies, but yourselves by your authority and benevolence defended him;\r\nneither could I, after his death, being then a boy, have maintained the\r\nposition of my house except by your favor and advice. Nor should we\r\never be able to conduct the affairs of this republic, if you did not\r\ncontribute to our support. Therefore, I know not the reason of their\r\nhatred toward us, or what just cause they have of envy. Let them direct\r\ntheir enmity against their own ancestors, who, by their pride and\r\navarice, lost the reputation which ours, by very opposite conduct, were\r\nenabled to acquire. But let it be granted we have greatly injured them,\r\nand that they are justified in seeking our ruin; why do they come and\r\ntake possession of the palace? Why enter into league with the pope\r\nand the king, against the liberties of this republic? Why break the\r\nlong-continued peace of Italy? They have no excuse for this; they ought\r\nto confine their vengeance to those who do them wrong, and not confound\r\nprivate animosities with public grievances. Hence it is that since their\r\ndefeat our misfortune is the greater; for on their account the pope and\r\nthe king make war upon us, and this war, they say, is directed against\r\nmy family and myself. And would to God that this were true; then the\r\nremedy would be sure and unfailing, for I would not be so base a citizen\r\nas to prefer my own safety to yours; I would at once resolve to ensure\r\nyour security, even though my own destruction were the immediate and\r\ninevitable consequence. But as the wrongs committed by princes are\r\nusually concealed under some less offensive covering, they have adopted\r\nthis plea to hide their more abominable purpose. If, however, you think\r\notherwise, I am in your hands; it is with you to do with me what you\r\nplease. You are my fathers, my protectors, and whatever you command me\r\nto do I will perform most willingly; nor will I ever refuse, when you\r\nfind occasion to require it, to close the war with my own blood which\r\nwas commenced with that of my brother.\" While Lorenzo spoke, the\r\ncitizens were unable to refrain from tears, and the sympathy with which\r\nhe had been heard was extended to their reply, delivered by one of\r\nthem in the name of the rest, who said that the city acknowledged many\r\nadvantages derived from the good qualities of himself and his family;\r\nand encouraged them to hope that with as much promptitude as they had\r\nused in his defense, and in avenging his brother's death, they would\r\nsecure to him his influence in the government, which he should never\r\nlose while they retained possession of the country. And that their deeds\r\nmight correspond with their words, they immediately appointed a number\r\nof armed men, as a guard for the security of his person against domestic\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Florentines prepare for war against the pope--They appeal to\r\na future council--Papal and Neapolitan movements against\r\nthe Florentines--The Venetians refuse to assist the\r\nFlorentines--Disturbances in Milan--Genoa revolts from the duke--Futile\r\nendeavors to effect peace with the pope--The Florentines repulse their\r\nenemies from the territory of Pisa--They attack the papal states--The\r\npapal forces routed upon the borders of the Lake of Perugia.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines now prepared for war, by raising money and collecting\r\nas large a force as possible. Being in league with the duke of Milan\r\nand the Venetians, they applied to both for assistance. As the pope had\r\nproved himself a wolf rather than a shepherd, to avoid being devoured\r\nunder false accusations, they justified their cause with all available\r\narguments, and filled Italy with accounts of the treachery practiced\r\nagainst their government, exposing the impiety and injustice of the\r\npontiff, and assured the world that the pontificate which he had\r\nwickedly attained, he would as impiously fill; for he had sent those\r\nwhom he had advanced to the highest order of prelacy, in the company\r\nof traitors and parricides, to commit the most horrid treachery in the\r\nchurch in the midst of divine service and during the celebration of the\r\nholy sacrament, and that then, having failed to murder the citizens,\r\nchange the government, and plunder the city, according to his intention,\r\nhe had suspended the performance of all religious offices, and\r\ninjuriously menaced and injured the republic with pontifical\r\nmaledictions. But if God was just, and violence was offensive to him, he\r\nwould be displeased with that of his viceregent, and allow his injured\r\npeople who were not admitted to communion with the latter, to offer\r\nup their prayers to himself. The Florentines, therefore, instead of\r\nreceiving or obeying the interdict, compelled the priests to perform\r\ndivine service, assembled a council in Florence of all the Tuscan\r\nprelates under their jurisdiction, and appealed against the injuries\r\nsuffered from the pontiff to a future general council.\r\n\r\nThe pope did not neglect to assign reasons in his own justification, and\r\nmaintained it was the duty of a pontiff to suppress tyranny, depress\r\nthe wicked, and exalt the good; and that this ought to be done by\r\nevery available means; but that secular princes had no right to detain\r\ncardinals, hang bishops, murder, mangle, and drag about the bodies of\r\npriests, destroying without distinction the innocent with the guilty.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these complaints and accusations, the Florentines\r\nrestored to the pope the cardinal whom they had detained, in return for\r\nwhich he immediately assailed them with his own forces and those of\r\nthe king. The two armies, under the command of Alfonso, eldest son of\r\nFerrando, and duke of Calabria, who had as his general, Federigo, count\r\nof Urbino, entered the Chianti, by permission of the Siennese, who sided\r\nwith the enemy, occupied Radda with many other fortresses, and having\r\nplundered the country, besieged the Castellina. The Florentines were\r\ngreatly alarmed at these attacks, being almost destitute of forces, and\r\nfinding their friends slow to assist; for though the duke sent them aid,\r\nthe Venetians denied all obligation to support the Florentines in their\r\nprivate quarrels, since the animosities of individuals were not to be\r\ndefended at the public expense. The Florentines, in order to induce the\r\nVenetians to take a more correct view of the case, sent Tommaso Soderini\r\nas their ambassador to the senate, and, in the meantime, engaged forces,\r\nand appointed Ercole, marquis of Ferrara, to the command of their army.\r\nWhile these preparations were being made, the Castellina was so hard\r\npressed by the enemy, that the inhabitants, despairing of relief,\r\nsurrendered, after having sustained a siege of forty-two days. The\r\nenemy then directed their course toward Arezzo, and encamped before San\r\nSavino. The Florentine army being now in order, went to meet them,\r\nand having approached within three miles, caused such annoyance, that\r\nFederigo d'Urbino demanded a truce for a few days, which was granted,\r\nbut proved so disadvantageous to the Florentines, that those who had\r\nmade the request were astonished at having obtained it; for, had it been\r\nrefused, they would have been compelled to retire in disgrace. Having\r\ngained these few days to recruit themselves, as soon as they were\r\nexpired, they took the castle in the presence of their enemies. Winter\r\nbeing now come, the forces of the pope and king retired for convenient\r\nquarters to the Siennese territory. The Florentines also withdrew to\r\na more commodious situation, and the marquis of Ferrara, having done\r\nlittle for himself and less for others, returned to his own territories.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Genoa withdrew from the dominion of Milan, under the\r\nfollowing circumstances. Galeazzo, at his death, left a son, Giovan\r\nGaleazzo, who being too young to undertake the government, dissensions\r\narose between Sforza, Lodovico, Ottaviano, and Ascanio, his uncles, and\r\nthe lady Bona, his mother, each of whom desired the guardianship of the\r\nyoung duke. By the advice and mediation of Tommaso Soderini, who\r\nwas then Florentine ambassador at the court of Milan, and of Cecco\r\nSimonetta, who had been secretary to Galeazzo, the lady Bona prevailed.\r\nThe uncles fled, Ottaviano was drowned in crossing the Adda; the rest\r\nwere banished to various places, together with Roberto da San Severino,\r\nwho in these disputes had deserted the duchess and joined the uncles\r\nof the duke. The troubles in Tuscany, which immediately followed,\r\ngave these princes hope that the new state of things would present\r\nopportunities for their advantage; they therefore quitted the places to\r\nwhich their exile limited them, and each endeavored to return home. King\r\nFerrando, finding the Florentines had obtained assistance from none but\r\nthe Milanese, took occasion to give the duchess so much occupation\r\nin her own government, as to render her unable to contribute to their\r\nassistance. By means of Prospero Adorno, the Signor Roberto, and the\r\nrebellious uncles of the duke, he caused Genoa to throw off the Milanese\r\nyoke. The Castelletto was the only place left; confiding in which, the\r\nduchess sent a strong force to recover the city, but it was routed by\r\nthe enemy; and perceiving the danger which might arise to her son and\r\nherself if the war were continued, Tuscany being in confusion, and the\r\nFlorentines, in whom alone she had hope, themselves in trouble, she\r\ndetermined, as she could not retain Genoa in subjection, to secure it\r\nas an ally; and agreed with Battistino Fregoso, the enemy of Prospero\r\nAdorno, to give him the Castelletto, and make him prince of Genoa, on\r\ncondition that he should expel Prospero, and do nothing in favor of her\r\nson's uncles. Upon this agreement, Battistino, by the assistance of the\r\nCastelletto and of his friends, became lord of Genoa; and according to\r\nthe custom of the city, took the title of Doge. The Sforzeschi and the\r\nSignor Roberto, being thus expelled by the Genoese, came with their\r\nforces into Lunigiana, and the pope and the king, perceiving the\r\ntroubles of Lombardy to be composed, took occasion with them to annoy\r\nTuscany in the Pisan territory, that the Florentines might be weakened\r\nby dividing their forces. At the close of winter they ordered Roberto\r\nda San Severino to leave Lunigiana and march thither, which he did, and\r\nwith great tumult plundered many fortresses, and overran the country\r\naround Pisa.\r\n\r\nAt this time, ambassadors came to Florence from the emperor, the king of\r\nFrance, and the king of Hungary, who were sent by their princes to the\r\npontiff. They solicited the Florentines also to send ambassadors to the\r\npope, and promised to use their utmost exertion to obtain for them an\r\nadvantageous peace. The Florentines did not refuse to make trial, both\r\nfor the sake of publicly justifying their proceedings, and because they\r\nwere really desirous of peace. Accordingly, the ambassadors were sent,\r\nbut returned without coming to any conclusion of their differences. The\r\nFlorentines, to avail themselves of the influence of the king of France,\r\nsince they were attacked by one part of the Italians and abandoned\r\nby the other, sent to him as their ambassador, Donato Acciajuoli, a\r\ndistinguished Latin and Greek scholar, whose ancestors had always ranked\r\nhigh in the city, but while on his journey he died at Milan. To relieve\r\nhis surviving family and pay a deserved tribute to his memory, he was\r\nhonorably buried at the public expense, provision was made for his sons,\r\nand suitable marriage portions given to his daughters, and Guid' Antonio\r\nVespucci, a man well acquainted with pontifical and imperial affairs,\r\nwas sent as ambassador to the king in his stead.\r\n\r\nThe attack of Signor Roberto upon the Pisan territory, being unexpected,\r\ngreatly perplexed the Florentines; for having to resist the foe in the\r\ndirection of Sienna, they knew not how to provide for the places about\r\nPisa. To keep the Lucchese faithful, and prevent them from furnishing\r\nthe enemy either with money or provisions, they sent as ambassador Piero\r\ndi Gino Capponi, who was received with so much jealousy, on account of\r\nthe hatred which that city always cherishes against the Florentines\r\nfrom former injuries and constant fear, that he was on many occasions in\r\ndanger of being put to death by the mob; and thus his mission gave fresh\r\ncause of animosity rather than of union. The Florentines recalled the\r\nmarquis of Ferrara, and engaged the marquis of Mantua; they also as\r\nearnestly requested the Venetians to send them Count Carlo, son of\r\nBraccio, and Deifobo, son of Count Jacopo, and after many delays, they\r\ncomplied; for having made a truce with the Turks, they had no excuse\r\nto justify a refusal, and could not break through the obligation of the\r\nLeague without the utmost disgrace. The counts, Carlo and Deifobo, came\r\nwith a good force, and being joined by all that could be spared from\r\nthe army, which, under the marquis of Ferrara, held in check the duke\r\nof Calabria, proceeded toward Pisa, to meet Signor Roberto, who was with\r\nhis troops near the river Serchio, and who, though he had expressed his\r\nintention of awaiting their arrival, withdrew to the camp at Lunigiana,\r\nwhich he had quitted upon coming into the Pisan territory, while Count\r\nCarlo recovered all the places that had been taken by the enemy in that\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines, being thus relieved from the attack in the direction of\r\nPisa, assembled the whole force between Colle and Santo Geminiano. But\r\nthe army, on the arrival of Count Carlo, being composed of Sforzeschi\r\nand Bracceschi, their hereditary feuds soon broke forth, and it was\r\nthought that if they remained long in company, they would turn their\r\narms against each other. It was therefore determined, as the smaller\r\nevil, to divide them; to send one party, under Count Carlo, into the\r\ndistrict of Perugia, and establish the other at Poggibonzi, where\r\nthey formed a strong encampment in order to prevent the enemy from\r\npenetrating the Florentine territory. By this they also hoped to compel\r\nthe enemy to divide their forces; for Count Carlo was understood to have\r\nmany partisans in Perugia, and it was therefore expected, either that\r\nhe would occupy the place, or that the pope would be compelled to send\r\na large body of men for its defense. To reduce the pontiff to greater\r\nnecessity, they ordered Niccolo Vitelli, who had been expelled from\r\nCitta di Castello, where his enemy Lorenzo Vitelli commanded, to lead a\r\nforce against that place, with the view of driving out his adversary\r\nand withdrawing it from obedience to the pope. At the beginning of the\r\ncampaign, fortune seemed to favor the Florentines; for Count Carlo made\r\nrapid advances in the Perugino, and Niccolo Vitelli, though unable to\r\nenter Castello, was superior in the field, and plundered the surrounding\r\ncountry without opposition. The forces also, at Poggibonzi, constantly\r\noverran the country up to the walls of Sienna. These hopes, however,\r\nwere not realized; for in the first place, Count Carlo died, while in\r\nthe fullest tide of success; though the consequences of this would have\r\nbeen less detrimental to the Florentines, had not the victory to which\r\nit gave occasion, been nullified by the misconduct of others. The death\r\nof the count being known, the forces of the church, which had already\r\nassembled in Perugia, conceived hopes of overcoming the Florentines, and\r\nencamped upon the lake, within three miles of the enemy. On the other\r\nside, Jacopo Guicciardini, commissary to the army, by the advice\r\nof Roberto da Rimino, who, after the death of Count Carlo, was the\r\nprincipal commander, knowing the ground of their sanguine expectations,\r\ndetermined to meet them, and coming to an engagement near the lake,\r\nupon the site of the memorable rout of the Romans, by Hannibal, the\r\nCarthaginian general, the papal forces were vanquished. The news of the\r\nvictory, which did great honor to the commanders, diffused universal\r\njoy at Florence, and would have ensured a favorable termination of the\r\ncampaign, had not the disorders which arose in the army at Poggibonzi\r\nthrown all into confusion; for the advantage obtained by the valor of\r\nthe one, was more than counterbalanced by the disgraceful proceedings\r\nof the other. Having made considerable booty in the Siennese territory,\r\nquarrels arose about the division of it between the marquis of Mantua\r\nand the marquis of Ferrara, who, coming to arms, assailed each other\r\nwith the utmost fury; and the Florentines seeing they could no longer\r\navail themselves of the services of both, allowed the marquis of Ferrara\r\nand his men to return home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe duke of Calabria routs the Florentine army at Poggibonzi--Dismay in\r\nFlorence on account of the defeat--Progress of the duke of Calabria--The\r\nFlorentines wish for peace--Lorenzo de' Medici determines to go to\r\nNaples to treat with the king--Lodovico Sforza, surnamed the Moor, and\r\nhis brothers, recalled to Milan--Changes in the government of that city\r\nin consequence--The Genoese take Serezana--Lorenzo de' Medici arrives\r\nat Naples--Peace concluded with the king--The pope and the Venetians\r\nconsent to the peace--The Florentines in fear of the duke of\r\nCalabria--Enterprises of the Turks--They take Otranto--The Florentines\r\nreconciled with the pope--Their ambassadors at the papal court--The\r\npope's reply to the ambassadors--The king of Naples restores to the\r\nFlorentines all the fortresses he had taken.\r\n\r\nThe army being thus reduced, without a leader, and disorder prevailing\r\nin every department, the duke of Calabria, who was with his forces near\r\nSienna, resolved to attack them immediately. The Florentines, finding\r\nthe enemy at hand, were seized with a sudden panic; neither their arms,\r\nnor their numbers, in which they were superior to their adversaries,\r\nnor their position, which was one of great strength, could give them\r\nconfidence; but observing the dust occasioned by the enemy's approach,\r\nwithout waiting for a sight of them, they fled in all directions,\r\nleaving their ammunition, carriages, and artillery to be taken by the\r\nfoe. Such cowardice and disorder prevailed in the armies of those times,\r\nthat the turning of a horse's head or tail was sufficient to decide the\r\nfate of an expedition. This defeat loaded the king's troops with booty,\r\nand filled the Florentines with dismay; for the city, besides the war,\r\nwas afflicted with pestilence, which prevailed so extensively, that all\r\nwho possessed villas fled to them to escape death. This occasioned the\r\ndefeat to be attended with greater horror; for those citizens whose\r\npossessions lay in the Val di Pesa and the Val d'Elsa, having retired to\r\nthem, hastened to Florence with all speed as soon as they heard of the\r\ndisaster, taking with them not only their children and their property,\r\nbut even their laborers; so that it seemed as if the enemy were expected\r\nevery moment in the city. Those who were appointed to the management\r\nof the war, perceiving the universal consternation, commanded the\r\nvictorious forces in the Perugino to give up their enterprise in that\r\ndirection, and march to oppose the enemy in the Val d'Elsa, who, after\r\ntheir victory, plundered the country without opposition; and although\r\nthe Florentine army had so closely pressed the city of Perugia that\r\nit was expected to fall into their hands every instant, the people\r\npreferred defending their own possessions to endeavoring to seize those\r\nof others. The troops, thus withdrawn from the pursuit of their good\r\nfortune, were marched to San Casciano, a castle within eight miles of\r\nFlorence; the leaders thinking they could take up no other position till\r\nthe relics of the routed army were assembled. On the other hand, the\r\nenemy being under no further restraint at Perugia, and emboldened by\r\nthe departure of the Florentines, plundered to a large amount in the\r\ndistricts of Arezzo and Cortona; while those who under Alfonso, duke\r\nof Calabria, had been victorious near Poggibonzi, took the town itself;\r\nsacked Vico and Certaldo, and after these conquests and pillagings\r\nencamped before the fortress of Colle, which was considered very strong;\r\nand as the garrison was brave and faithful to the Florentines, it was\r\nhoped they would hold the enemy at bay till the republic was able to\r\ncollect its forces. The Florentines being at Santo Casciano, and the\r\nenemy continuing to use their utmost exertions against Colle, they\r\ndetermined to draw nearer, that the inhabitants might be more resolute\r\nin their defense, and the enemy assail them less boldly. With this\r\ndesign they removed their camp from Santo Casciano to Santo Geminiano,\r\nabout five miles from Colle, and with light cavalry and other suitable\r\nforces were able every day to annoy the duke's camp. All this, however,\r\nwas insufficient to relieve the people of Colle; for, having consumed\r\ntheir provisions, they were compelled to surrender on the thirteenth of\r\nNovember, to the great grief of the Florentines, and joy of the enemy,\r\nmore especially of the Siennese, who, besides their habitual hatred of\r\nthe Florentines, had a particular animosity against the people of Colle.\r\n\r\nIt was now the depth of winter, and the weather so unsuitable for war,\r\nthat the pope and the king, either designing to hold out a hope of\r\npeace, or more quietly to enjoy the fruit of their victories, proposed a\r\ntruce for three months to the Florentines, and allowed them ten days to\r\nconsider the reply. The offer was eagerly accepted; but as wounds are\r\nwell known to be more painful after the blood cools than when they\r\nwere first received, this brief repose awakened the Florentines to a\r\nconsciousness of the miseries they had endured; and the citizens openly\r\nlaid the blame upon each other, pointing out the errors committed in the\r\nmanagement of the war, the expenses uselessly incurred, and the taxes\r\nunjustly imposed. These matters were boldly discussed, not only in\r\nprivate circles, but in the public councils; and one individual even\r\nventured to turn to Lorenzo de' Medici, and say, \"The city is exhausted,\r\nand can endure no more war; it is therefore necessary to think of\r\npeace.\" Lorenzo was himself aware of the necessity, and assembled the\r\nfriends in whose wisdom and fidelity he had the greatest confidence,\r\nwhen it was at once concluded, that as the Venetians were lukewarm and\r\nunfaithful, and the duke in the power of his guardians, and involved\r\nin domestic difficulties, it would be desirable by some new alliance to\r\ngive a better turn to their affairs. They were in doubt whether to apply\r\nto the king or to the pope; but having examined the question in all\r\nsides, they preferred the friendship of the king as more suitable and\r\nsecure; for the short reigns of the pontiffs, the changes ensuing upon\r\neach succession, the disregard shown by their church toward temporal\r\nprinces, and the still greater want of respect for them exhibited in\r\nher determinations, render it impossible for a secular prince to trust\r\na pontiff, or safely to share his fortune; for an adherent of the pope\r\nwill have a companion in victory, but in defeat must stand alone, while\r\nthe pontiff is sustained by his spiritual power and influence. Having\r\ntherefore decided that the king's friendship would be of the greatest\r\nutility to them, they thought it would be most easily and certainly\r\nobtained by Lorenzo's presence; for in proportion to the confidence they\r\nevinced toward him, the greater they imagined would be the probability\r\nof removing his impressions of past enmities. Lorenzo having resolved to\r\ngo to Naples, recommended the city and government to the care of Tommaso\r\nSoderini, who was at that time Gonfalonier of Justice. He left Florence\r\nat the beginning of December, and having arrived at Pisa, wrote to\r\nthe government to acquaint them with the cause of his departure. The\r\nSignory, to do him honor, and enable him the more effectually to treat\r\nwith the king, appointed him ambassador from the Florentine people, and\r\nendowed him with full authority to make such arrangements as he thought\r\nmost useful for the republic.\r\n\r\nAt this time Roberto da San Severino, with Lodovico and Ascanio (Sforza\r\ntheir elder brother being dead) again attacked Milan, in order to\r\nrecover the government. Having taken Tortona, and the city and the\r\nwhole state being in arms, the duchess Bona was advised to restore the\r\nSforzeschi, and to put a stop to civil contentions by admitting them to\r\nthe government. The person who gave this advice was Antonio Tassino, of\r\nFerrara, a man of low origin, who, coming to Milan, fell into the hands\r\nof the duke Galeazzo, and was given by him to his duchess for her valet.\r\nHe, either from his personal attractions, or some secret influence,\r\nafter the duke's death attained such influence over the duchess, that\r\nhe governed the state almost at his will. This greatly displeased\r\nthe minister Cecco, whom prudence and long experience had rendered\r\ninvaluable; and who, to the utmost of his power, endeavored to diminish\r\nthe authority of Tassino with the duchess and other members of the\r\ngovernment. The latter, aware of this, to avenge himself for the injury,\r\nand secure defenders against Cecco, advised the duchess to recall the\r\nSforzeschi, which she did, without communicating her design to the\r\nminister, who, when it was done, said to her, \"You have taken a step\r\nwhich will deprive me of my life, and you of the government.\" This\r\nshortly afterward took place; for Cecco was put to death by Lodovico,\r\nand Tassino, being expelled from the dukedom, the duchess was so enraged\r\nthat she left Milan, and gave up the care of her son to Lodovico, who,\r\nbecoming sole governor of the dukedom, caused, as will be hereafter\r\nseen, the ruin of Italy.\r\n\r\nLorenzo de' Medici had set out for Naples, and the truce between the\r\nparties was in force, when, quite unexpectedly, Lodovico Fregoso, being\r\nin correspondence with some persons of Serezana, entered the place by\r\nstealth, took possession of it with an armed force, and imprisoned the\r\nFlorentine governor. This greatly offended the Signory, for they thought\r\nthe whole had been concerted with the connivance of King Ferrando. They\r\ncomplained to the duke of Calabria, who was with the army at Sienna,\r\nof a breach of the truce; and he endeavored to prove, by letters and\r\nembassies, that it had occurred without either his own or his father's\r\nknowledge. The Florentines, however, found themselves in a very awkward\r\npredicament, being destitute of money, the head of the republic in the\r\npower of the king, themselves engaged in a long-standing war with the\r\nlatter and the pope, in a new one with the Genoese, and entirely without\r\nfriends; for they had no confidence in the Venetians, and on account\r\nof its changeable and unsettled state they were rather apprehensive of\r\nMilan. They had thus only one hope, and that depended upon Lorenzo's\r\nsuccess with the king.\r\n\r\nLorenzo arrived at Naples by sea, and was most honorably received, not\r\nonly by Ferrando, but by the whole city, his coming having excited the\r\ngreatest expectation; for it being generally understood that the war was\r\nundertaken for the sole purpose of effecting his destruction, the power\r\nof his enemies invested his name with additional lustre. Being admitted\r\nto the king's presence, he spoke with so much propriety upon the affairs\r\nof Italy, the disposition of her princes and people, his hopes\r\nfrom peace, his fears of the results of war, that Ferrando was more\r\nastonished at the greatness of his mind, the promptitude of his genius,\r\nhis gravity and wisdom, than he had previously been at his power.\r\nHe consequently treated him with redoubled honor, and began to feel\r\ncompelled rather to part with him as a friend, than detain him as an\r\nenemy. However, under various pretexts he kept Lorenzo from December\r\ntill March, not only to gain the most perfect knowledge of his own\r\nviews, but of those of his city; for he was not without enemies, who\r\nwould have wished the king to detain and treat him in the same manner as\r\nJacopo Piccinino; and, with the ostensible view of sympathizing for him,\r\npointed out all that would, or rather that they wished should, result\r\nfrom such a course; at the same time opposing in the council every\r\nproposition at all likely to favor him. By such means as these the\r\nopinion gained ground, that if he were detained at Naples much longer,\r\nthe government of Florence would be changed. This caused the king to\r\npostpone their separation more than he would have otherwise done, to\r\nsee if any disturbance were likely to arise. But finding everything go\r\nquietly on, Ferrando allowed him to depart on the sixth of March, 1479,\r\nhaving, with every kind of attention and token of regard, endeavored to\r\ngain his affection, and formed with him a perpetual alliance for their\r\nmutual defense. Lorenzo returned to Florence, and upon presenting\r\nhimself before the citizens, the impressions he had created in the\r\npopular mind surrounded him with a halo of majesty brighter than before.\r\nHe was received with all the joy merited by his extraordinary qualities\r\nand recent services, in having exposed his own life to the most imminent\r\nperil, in order to restore peace to his country. Two days after his\r\nreturn, the treaty between the republic of Florence and the king, by\r\nwhich each party bound itself to defend the other's territories, was\r\npublished. The places taken from the Florentines during the war were\r\nto be taken up at the discretion of the king; the Pazzi confined in the\r\ntower of Volterra were to be set at liberty, and a certain sum of money,\r\nfor a limited period, was to be paid to the duke of Calabria.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this peace was publicly known, the pope and the Venetians\r\nwere transported with rage; the pope thought himself neglected by\r\nthe king; the Venetians entertained similar ideas with regard to the\r\nFlorentines, and complained that, having been companions in the war,\r\nthey were not allowed to participate in the peace. Reports of this\r\ndescription being spread abroad, and received with entire credence at\r\nFlorence, caused a general fear that the peace thus made would give rise\r\nto greater wars; and therefore the leading members of the government\r\ndetermined to confine the consideration of the most important affairs to\r\na smaller number, and formed a council of seventy citizens, in whom the\r\nprincipal authority was invested. This new regulation calmed the minds\r\nof those desirous of change, by convincing them of the futility of their\r\nefforts. To establish their authority, they in the first place ratified\r\nthe treaty of peace with the king, and sent as ambassadors to the pope\r\nAntonio Ridolfi and Piero Nasi. But, notwithstanding the peace, Alfonso,\r\nduke of Calabria, still remained at Sienna with his forces, pretending\r\nto be detained by discords among the citizens, which, he said, had risen\r\nso high, that while he resided outside the city they had compelled\r\nhim to enter and assume the office of arbitrator between them. He took\r\noccasion to draw large sums of money from the wealthiest citizens by way\r\nof fines, imprisoned many, banished others, and put some to death; he\r\nthus became suspected, not only by the Siennese but by the Florentines,\r\nof a design to usurp the sovereignty of Sienna; nor was any remedy then\r\navailable, for the republic had formed a new alliance with the king,\r\nand were at enmity with the pope and the Venetians. This suspicion was\r\nentertained not only by the great body of the Florentine people, who\r\nwere subtle interpreters of appearances, but by the principal members of\r\nthe government; and it was agreed, on all hands, that the city never\r\nwas in so much danger of losing her liberty. But God, who in similar\r\nextremities has always been her preserver, caused an unhoped-for event\r\nto take place, which gave the pope, the king, and the Venetians other\r\nmatters to think of than those in Tuscany.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish emperor, Mahomet II. had gone with a large army to the siege\r\nof Rhodes, and continued it for several months; but though his forces\r\nwere numerous, and his courage indomitable, he found them more than\r\nequalled by those of the besieged, who resisted his attack with such\r\nobstinate valor, that he was at last compelled to retire in disgrace.\r\nHaving left Rhodes, part of his army, under the Pasha Achmet, approached\r\nVelona, and, either from observing the facility of the enterprise, or\r\nin obedience to his sovereign's commands, coasting along the Italian\r\nshores, he suddenly landed four thousand soldiers, and attacked the city\r\nof Otranto, which he easily took, plundered, and put all the inhabitants\r\nto the sword. He then fortified the city and port, and having assembled\r\na large body of cavalry, pillaged the surrounding country. The king,\r\nlearning this, and aware of the redoubtable character of his assailant,\r\nimmediately sent messengers to all the surrounding powers, to request\r\nassistance against the common enemy, and ordered the immediate return of\r\nthe duke of Calabria with the forces at Sienna.\r\n\r\nThis attack, however it might annoy the duke and the rest of Italy,\r\noccasioned the utmost joy at Florence and Sienna; the latter thinking it\r\nhad recovered its liberty, and the former that she had escaped a storm\r\nwhich threatened her with destruction. These impressions, which were not\r\nunknown to the duke, increased the regret he felt at his departure\r\nfrom Sienna; and he accused fortune of having, by an unexpected and\r\nunaccountable accident, deprived him of the sovereignty of Tuscany. The\r\nsame circumstance changed the disposition of the pope; for although he\r\nhad previously refused to receive any ambassador from Florence, he was\r\nnow so mollified as to be anxious to listen to any overtures of peace;\r\nand it was intimated to the Florentines, that if they would condescend\r\nto ask the pope's pardon, they would be sure of obtaining it. Thinking\r\nit advisable to seize the opportunity, they sent twelve ambassadors\r\nto the pontiff, who, on their arrival, detained them under different\r\npretexts before he would admit them to an audience. However, terms were\r\nat length settled, and what should be contributed by each in peace or\r\nwar. The messengers were then admitted to the feet of the pontiff, who,\r\nwith the utmost pomp, received them in the midst of his cardinals. They\r\napologized for past occurrences; first showing they had been compelled\r\nby necessity, then blaming the malignity of others, or the rage of the\r\npopulace, and their just indignation, and enlarging on the unfortunate\r\ncondition of those who are compelled either to fight or die; saying,\r\nthat since every extremity is endured in order to avoid death, they had\r\nsuffered war, interdicts, and other inconveniences, brought upon them\r\nby recent events, that their republic might escape slavery, which is\r\nthe death of free cities. However, if in their necessities they had\r\ncommitted any offense, they were desirous to make atonement, and trusted\r\nin his clemency, who, after the example of the blessed Redeemer, would\r\nreceive them into his compassionate arms.\r\n\r\nThe pope's reply was indignant and haughty. After reiterating all the\r\noffenses against the church during the late transactions, he said that,\r\nto comply with the precepts of God, he would grant the pardon they\r\nasked, but would have them understand, that it was their duty to obey;\r\nand that upon the next instance of their disobedience, they would\r\ninevitably forfeit, and that most deservedly, the liberty which they had\r\njust been upon the point of losing; for those merit freedom who exercise\r\nthemselves in good works and avoid evil; that liberty, improperly used,\r\ninjures itself and others; that to think little of God, and less of his\r\nchurch, is not the part of a free man, but a fool, and one disposed to\r\nevil rather than good, and to effect whose correction is the duty not\r\nonly of princes but of every Christian; so that in respect of the recent\r\nevents, they had only themselves to blame, who, by their evil deeds, had\r\ngiven rise to the war, and inflamed it by still worse actions, it having\r\nbeen terminated by the kindness of others rather than by any merit of\r\ntheir own. The formula of agreement and benediction was then read; and,\r\nin addition to what had already been considered and agreed upon between\r\nthe parties, the pope said, that if the Florentines wished to enjoy the\r\nfruit of his forgiveness, they must maintain fifteen galleys, armed,\r\nand equipped, at their own expense, as long as the Turks should make\r\nwar upon the kingdom of Naples. The ambassadors complained much of this\r\nburden in addition to the arrangement already made, but were unable to\r\nobtain any alleviation. However, after their return to Florence, the\r\nSignory sent, as ambassador to the pope, Guidantonio Vespucci, who\r\nhad recently returned from France, and who by his prudence brought\r\neverything to an amicable conclusion, obtained many favors from the\r\npontiff, which were considered as presages of a closer reconciliation.\r\n\r\nHaving settled their affairs with the pope, Sienna being free,\r\nthemselves released from the fear of the king, by the departure of\r\nthe duke of Calabria from Tuscany, and the war with the Turks\r\nstill continuing, the Florentines pressed the king to restore their\r\nfortresses, which the duke of Calabria, upon quitting the country, had\r\nleft in the hands of the Siennese. Ferrando, apprehensive that if he\r\nrefused, they would withdraw from the alliance with him, and by new wars\r\nwith the Siennese deprive him of the assistance he hoped to obtain from\r\nthe pope and other Italian powers, consented that they should be given\r\nup, and by new favors endeavored to attach the Florentines to his\r\ninterests. It is thus evident, that force and necessity, not deeds and\r\nobligations, induce princes to keep faith.\r\n\r\nThe castles being restored, and this new alliance established, Lorenzo\r\nde' Medici recovered the reputation which first the war and then the\r\npeace, when the king's designs were doubtful, had deprived him of; for\r\nat this period there was no lack of those who openly slandered him with\r\nhaving sold his country to save himself, and said, that in war they had\r\nlost their territories, and in peace their liberty. But the fortresses\r\nbeing recovered, an honorable treaty ratified with the king, and the\r\ncity restored to her former influence, the spirit of public discourse\r\nentirely changed in Florence, a place greatly addicted to gossip, and in\r\nwhich actions are judged by the success attending them, rather than by\r\nthe intelligence employed in their direction; therefore, the citizens\r\npraised Lorenzo extravagantly, declaring that by his prudence he had\r\nrecovered in peace, what unfavorable circumstances had taken from them\r\nin war, and that by his discretion and judgment he had done more than\r\nthe enemy with all the force of their arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nNew occasions of war in Italy--Differences between the marquis of\r\nFerrara, and the Venetians--The king of Naples and the Florentines\r\nattack the papal states--The pope's defensive arrangements--The\r\nNeapolitan army routed by the papal forces--Progress of the Venetians\r\nagainst the marquis of Ferrara--The pope makes peace, and enters into\r\na league against the Venetians--Operations of the League against the\r\nVenetians--The Venetians routed at Bondeno--Their losses--Disunion among\r\nthe League--Lodovico Sforza makes peace with the Venetians--Ratified by\r\nthe other parties.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of the Turks had deferred the war which was about to break\r\nforth from the anger of the pope and the Venetians at the peace between\r\nthe Florentines and the king. But as the beginning of that invasion was\r\nunexpected and beneficial, its conclusion was equally unlooked for and\r\ninjurious; for Mahomet dying suddenly, dissensions arose among his sons,\r\nand the forces which were in Puglia being abandoned by their commander,\r\nsurrendered Otranto to the king. The fears which restrained the pope and\r\nthe Venetians being thus removed, everyone became apprehensive of new\r\ntroubles. On the one hand, was the league of the pope and the Venetians,\r\nand with them the Genoese, Siennese, and other minor powers; on the\r\nother, the Florentines, the king, and the duke, with whom were the\r\nBolognese and many princes. The Venetians wished to become lords of\r\nFerrara, and thought they were justified by circumstances in making\r\nthe attempt, and hoping for a favorable result. Their differences arose\r\nthus: the marquis of Ferrara affirmed he was under no obligation to\r\ntake salt from the Venetians, or to admit their governor; the terms of\r\nconvention between them declaring, that after seventy years, the city\r\nwas to be free from both impositions. The Venetians replied, that so\r\nlong as he held the Polesine, he was bound to receive their salt\r\nand their governor. The marquis refusing his consent, the Venetians\r\nconsidered themselves justified in taking arms, and that the present\r\nmoment offered a suitable opportunity; for the pope was indignant\r\nagainst the Florentines and the king; and to attach the pope still\r\nfurther, the Count Girolamo, who was then at Venice, was received with\r\nall possible respect; first admitted to the privileges of a citizen,\r\nand then raised to the rank of a senator, the highest distinctions the\r\nVenetian senate can confer. To prepare for the war, they levied new\r\ntaxes, and appointed to the command of the forces, Roberto da San\r\nSeverino, who being offended with Lodovico, governor of Milan, fled to\r\nTortona, whence, after occasioning some disturbances, he went to Genoa,\r\nand while there, was sent for by the Venetians, and placed at the head\r\nof their troops.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances becoming known to the opposite league, induced it\r\nalso to provide for war. The duke of Milan appointed as his general,\r\nFederigo d'Urbino; the Florentines engaged Costanzo, lord of Pesaro;\r\nand to sound the disposition of the pope, and know whether the Venetians\r\nmade war against Ferrara with his consent or not, King Ferrando sent\r\nAlfonso, duke of Calabria, with his army across the Tronto, and asked\r\nthe pontiff's permission to pass into Lombardy to assist the marquis,\r\nwhich was refused in the most peremptory manner. The Florentines and\r\nthe king, no longer doubtful about the pope's intentions, determined to\r\nharass him, and thus either compel him to take part with them, or\r\nthrow such obstacles in his way, as would prevent him from helping\r\nthe Venetians, who had already taken the field, attacked the marquis,\r\noverran his territory, and encamped before Figaruolo, a fortress of the\r\ngreatest importance. In pursuance of the design of the Florentines and\r\nthe king, the duke of Calabria, by the assistance of the Colonna family\r\n(the Orsini had joined the pope), plundered the country about Rome\r\nand committed great devastation; while the Florentines, with Niccolo\r\nVitelli, besieged and took Citta di Castello, expelling Lorenzo Vitelli,\r\nwho held it for the pope, and placing Niccolo in it as prince.\r\n\r\nThe pope now found himself in very great straits; for the city of Rome\r\nwas disturbed by factions and the country covered with enemies. But\r\nacting with courage and resolution, he appointed Roberto da Rimino to\r\ntake the command of his forces; and having sent for him to Rome, where\r\nhis troops were assembled, told him how great would be the honor, if\r\nhe could deliver the church from the king's forces, and the troubles in\r\nwhich it was involved; how greatly indebted, not only himself, but all\r\nhis successors would be, and, that not mankind merely, but God himself\r\nwould be under obligations to him. The magnificent Roberto, having\r\nconsidered the forces and preparations already made, advised the pope to\r\nraise as numerous a body of infantry as possible, which was done without\r\ndelay. The duke of Calabria was at hand, and constantly harassed the\r\ncountry up to the very gates of Rome, which so roused the indignation\r\nof the citizens, that many offered their assistance to Roberto, and\r\nall were thankfully received. The duke, hearing of these preparations,\r\nwithdrew a short distance from the city, that in the belief of finding\r\nhim gone, the magnificent Roberto would not pursue him, and also in\r\nexpectation of his brother Federigo, whom their father had sent to him\r\nwith additional forces. But Roberto, finding himself nearly equal to the\r\nduke in cavalry, and superior in infantry, marched boldly out of Rome\r\nand took a position within two miles of the enemy. The duke, seeing his\r\nadversaries close upon him, found he must either fight or disgracefully\r\nretire. To avoid a retreat unbecoming a king's son, he resolved to face\r\nthe enemy; and a battle ensued which continued from morning till midday.\r\nIn this engagement, greater valor was exhibited on both sides than\r\nhad been shown in any other during the last fifty years, upward of a\r\nthousand dead being left upon the field. The troops of the church were\r\nat length victorious, for her numerous infantry so annoyed the ducal\r\ncavalry, that they were compelled to retreat, and Alfonso himself would\r\nhave fallen into the hands of the enemy, had he not been rescued by a\r\nbody of Turks, who remained at Otranto, and were at that time in his\r\nservice. The lord of Rimino, after this victory, returned triumphantly\r\nto Rome, but did not long enjoy the fruit of his valor; for having,\r\nduring the heat of the engagement, taken a copious draught of water,\r\nhe was seized with a flux, of which he very shortly afterward died. The\r\npope caused his funeral to be conducted with great pomp, and in a few\r\ndays, sent the Count Girolamo toward Citta di Castello to restore it\r\nto Lorenzo, and also endeavor to gain Rimino, which being by Roberto's\r\ndeath left to the care of his widow and a son who was quite a boy, his\r\nholiness thought might be easily won; and this certainly would have\r\nbeen the case, if the lady had not been defended by the Florentines,\r\nwho opposed him so effectually, as to prevent his success against both\r\nCastello and Rimino.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were in progress at Rome and in Romagna, the\r\nVenetians took possession of Figaruolo and crossed the Po with their\r\nforces. The camp of the duke of Milan and the marquis was in disorder;\r\nfor the count of Urbino having fallen ill, was carried to Bologna for\r\nhis recovery, but died. Thus the marquis's affairs were unfortunately\r\nsituated, while those of the Venetians gave them increasing hopes of\r\noccupying Ferrara. The Florentines and the king of Naples used their\r\nutmost endeavors to gain the pope to their views; and not having\r\nsucceeded by force, they threatened him with the council, which had\r\nalready been summoned by the emperor to assemble at Basle; and by\r\nmeans of the imperial ambassadors, and the co-operation of the leading\r\ncardinals, who were desirous of peace, the pope was compelled to turn\r\nhis attention toward effecting the pacification of Italy. With this\r\nview, at the instigation of his fears, and with the conviction that the\r\naggrandizement of the Venetians would be the ruin of the church and of\r\nItaly, he endeavored to make peace with the League, and sent his nuncios\r\nto Naples, where a treaty was concluded for five years, between the\r\npope, the king, the duke of Milan, and the Florentines, with an opening\r\nfor the Venetians to join them if they thought proper. When this was\r\naccomplished, the pope intimated to the Venetians, that they must desist\r\nfrom war against Ferrara. They refused to comply, and made preparations\r\nto prosecute their design with greater vigor than they had hitherto\r\ndone; and having routed the forces of the duke and the marquis at\r\nArgenta, they approached Ferrara so closely as to pitch their tents in\r\nthe marquis's park.\r\n\r\nThe League found they must no longer delay rendering him efficient\r\nassistance, and ordered the duke of Calabria to march to Ferrara with\r\nhis forces and those of the pope, the Florentine troops also moving in\r\nthe same direction. In order to direct the operations of the war with\r\ngreater efficiency, the League assembled a diet at Cremona, which was\r\nattended by the pope's legate, the Count Girolamo, the duke of Calabria,\r\nthe Signor Lodovico Sforza, and Lorenzo de' Medici, with many other\r\nItalian princes; and when the measures to be adopted were fully\r\ndiscussed, having decided that the best way of relieving Ferrara would\r\nbe to effect a division of the enemy's forces, the League desired\r\nLodovico to attack the Venetians on the side of Milan, but this he\r\ndeclined, for fear of bringing a war upon the duke's territories, which\r\nit would be difficult to quell. It was therefore resolved to proceed\r\nwith the united forces of the League to Ferrara, and having assembled\r\nfour thousand cavalry and eight thousand infantry, they went in pursuit\r\nof the Venetians, whose force amounted to two thousand two hundred\r\nmen at arms, and six thousand foot. They first attacked the Venetian\r\nflotilla, then lying upon the river Po, which they routed with the loss\r\nof above two hundred vessels, and took prisoner Antonio Justiniano, the\r\npurveyor of the fleet. The Venetians, finding all Italy united against\r\nthem, endeavored to support their reputation by engaging in their\r\nservice the duke of Lorraine, who joined them with two hundred men at\r\narms: and having suffered so great a destruction of their fleet, they\r\nsent him, with part of their army, to keep their enemies at bay, and\r\nRoberto da San Severino to cross the Adda with the remainder, and\r\nproceed to Milan, where they were to raise the cry of \"The duke and the\r\nLady Bona,\" his mother; hoping by this means to give a new aspect to\r\naffairs there, believing that Lodovico and his government were generally\r\nunpopular. This attack at first created great consternation, and roused\r\nthe citizens in arms; but eventually produced consequences unfavorable\r\nto the designs of the Venetians; for Lodovico was now desirous to\r\nundertake what he had refused to do at the entreaty of his allies.\r\nLeaving the marquis of Ferrara to the defense of his own territories,\r\nhe, with four thousand horse and two thousand foot, and joined by the\r\nduke of Calabria with twelve thousand horse and five thousand foot,\r\nentered the territory of Bergamo, then Brescia, next that of Verona,\r\nand, in defiance of the Venetians, plundered the whole country; for it\r\nwas with the greatest difficulty that Roberto and his forces could\r\nsave the cities themselves. In the meantime, the marquis of Ferrara had\r\nrecovered a great part of his territories; for the duke of Lorraine, by\r\nwhom he was attacked, having only at his command two thousand horse and\r\none thousand foot, could not withstand him. Hence, during the whole of\r\n1483, the affairs of the League were prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe winter having passed quietly over, the armies again took the field.\r\nTo produce the greater impression upon the enemy, the League united\r\ntheir whole force, and would easily have deprived the Venetians of all\r\nthey possessed in Lombardy, if the war had been conducted in the same\r\nmanner as during the preceding year; for by the departure of the duke\r\nof Lorraine, whose term of service had expired, they were reduced to\r\nsix thousand horse and five thousand foot, while the allies had thirteen\r\nthousand horse and five thousand foot at their disposal. But, as is\r\noften the case where several of equal authority are joined in command,\r\ntheir want of unity decided the victory to their enemies. Federigo,\r\nmarquis of Mantua, whose influence kept the duke of Calabria and\r\nLodovico Sforza within bounds, being dead, differences arose between\r\nthem which soon became jealousies. Giovan Galeazzo, duke of Milan, was\r\nnow of an age to take the government on himself, and had married the\r\ndaughter of the duke of Calabria, who wished his son-in-law to exercise\r\nthe government and not Lodovico; the latter, being aware of the duke's\r\ndesign, studied to prevent him from effecting it. The position of\r\nLodovico being known to the Venetians, they thought they could make it\r\navailable for their own interests; and hoped, as they had often before\r\ndone, to recover in peace all they had lost by war; and having secretly\r\nentered into treaty with Lodovico, the terms were concluded in August,\r\n1484. When this became known to the rest of the allies, they were\r\ngreatly dissatisfied, principally because they found that the places won\r\nfrom the Venetians were to be restored; that they were allowed to\r\nkeep Rovigo and the Polesine, which they had taken from the marquis of\r\nFerrara, and besides this retain all the pre-eminence and authority over\r\nFerrara itself which they had formerly possessed. Thus it was evident\r\nto everyone, they had been engaged in a war which had cost vast sums of\r\nmoney, during the progress of which they had acquired honor, and which\r\nwas concluded with disgrace; for the places wrested from the enemy were\r\nrestored without themselves recovering those they had lost. They\r\nwere, however, compelled to ratify the treaty, on account of the\r\nunsatisfactory state of their finances, and because the faults and\r\nambition of others had rendered them unwilling to put their fortunes to\r\nfurther proof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAffairs of the pope--He is reconciled to Niccolo Vitelli--Discords\r\nbetween the Colonnesi and the Orsini--Various events--The war\r\nof Serezana--Genoa occupied by her archbishop--Death of Sixtus\r\nIV.--Innocent VIII. elected--Agostino Fregoso gives Serezana to the bank\r\nof St. Giorgio--Account of the bank of St. Giorgio--War with the\r\nGenoese for Serezana--Stratagem of the Florentines to attack Pietra\r\nSanta--Difficulties and final surrender of Pietra Santa--The Lucchese\r\nlay claim to Pietra Santa--The city of L'Aquila revolts against the king\r\nof Naples--War between him and the pope--The Florentines take the king's\r\nparty--Peace between the pope and the king.\r\n\r\nDuring these events in Lombardy, the pope sent Lorenzo to invest Citta\r\ndi Castello, for the purpose of expelling Niccolo Vitelli, the place\r\nhaving been abandoned to him by the League, for the purpose of inducing\r\nthe pontiff to join them. During the siege, Niccolo's troops were\r\nled out against the papal forces and routed them. Upon this the pope\r\nrecalled the Count Girolamo from Lombardy with orders first to recruit\r\nhis army at Rome, and then proceed against Citta di Castello. But\r\nthinking afterward, that it would be better to obtain Niccolo Vitello\r\nas his friend than to renew hostilities with him, an arrangement was\r\nentered into by which the latter retained Citta di Castello, and the\r\npope pacified Lorenzo as well as he could. He was induced to both these\r\nmeasures rather by his apprehension of fresh troubles than by his love\r\nof peace, for he perceived dissensions arising between the Colonessi and\r\nthe Orsini.\r\n\r\nIn the war between the king of Naples and the pope, the former had\r\ntaken the district of Tagliacozzo from the Orsini, and given it to the\r\nColonnesi, who had espoused his cause. Upon the establishment of peace,\r\nthe Orsini demanded its restoration by virtue of the treaty. The pope\r\nhad frequently intimated to the Colonnesi that it ought to be restored;\r\nbut they, instead of complying with the entreaties of the Orsini, or\r\nbeing influenced by the pope's threats, renewed hostilities against the\r\nformer. Upon this the pontiff, unable to endure their insolence, united\r\nhis own forces with those of the Orsini, plundered the houses they\r\npossessed in Rome, slew or made prisoners all who defended them, and\r\nseized most of their fortresses. So that when these troubles were\r\ncomposed, it was rather by the complete subjugation of one party than\r\nfrom any desire for peace in the other.\r\n\r\nNor were the affairs of Genoa or of Tuscany in repose, for the\r\nFlorentines kept the Count Antonio da Marciano on the borders of\r\nSerezana; and while the war continued in Lombardy, annoyed the people\r\nof Serezana by inroads and light skirmishes. Battistino Fregoso, doge of\r\nGenoa, trusting to Pagolo Fregoso, the archbishop, was taken prisoner,\r\nwith his wife and children, by the latter, who assumed the sovereignty\r\nof the city. The Venetian fleet had attacked the kingdom of Naples,\r\ntaken Gallipoli, and harassed the neighboring places. But upon the peace\r\nof Lombardy, all tumults were hushed except those of Tuscany and Rome;\r\nfor the pope died in five days after its declaration, either in the\r\nnatural course of things, or because his grief for peace, to which he\r\nwas always opposed, occasioned his end.\r\n\r\nUpon the decease of the pontiff, Rome was immediately in arms. The Count\r\nGirolamo withdrew his forces into the castle; and the Orsini feared the\r\nColonnesi would avenge the injuries they had recently sustained. The\r\nColonnesi demanded the restitution of their houses and castles, so that\r\nin a few days robberies, fires, and murders prevailed in several parts\r\nof the city. The cardinals entreated the count to give the castle into\r\nthe hands of the college, withdraw his troops, and deliver Rome from\r\nthe fear of his forces, and he, by way of ingratiating himself with the\r\nfuture pontiff obeyed, and retired to Imola. The cardinals, being thus\r\ndivested of their fears, and the barons hopeless of assistance in their\r\nquarrels, proceeded to create a new pontiff, and after some discussion,\r\nGiovanni Batista Cibo, a Genoese, cardinal of Malfetta, was elected, and\r\ntook the name of Innocent VIII. By the mildness of his disposition (for\r\nhe was peaceable and humane) he caused a cessation of hostilities, and\r\nfor the present restored peace to Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines, after the pacification of Lombardy, could not remain\r\nquiet; for it appeared disgraceful that a private gentleman should\r\ndeprive them of the fortress of Serezana; and as it was allowed by the\r\nconditions of peace, not only to demand lost places, but to make war\r\nupon any who should impede their restoration, they immediately provided\r\nmen and money to undertake its recovery. Upon this, Agostino Fregoso,\r\nwho had seized Serezana, being unable to defend it, gave the fortress to\r\nthe Bank of St. Giorgio. As we shall have frequent occasion to speak of\r\nSt. Giorgio and the Genoese, it will not be improper, since Genoa is\r\none of the principal cities of Italy, to give some account of the\r\nregulations and usages prevailing there. When the Genoese had made peace\r\nwith the Venetians, after the great war, many years ago, the republic,\r\nbeing unable to satisfy the claims of those who had advanced large sums\r\nof money for its use, conceded to them the revenue of the Dogano or\r\ncustomhouse, so that each creditor should participate in the receipts\r\nin proportion to his claim, until the whole amount should be liquidated,\r\nand as a suitable place for their assembling, the palace over the\r\nDogano was assigned for their use. These creditors established a form of\r\ngovernment among themselves, appointing a council of one hundred persons\r\nfor the direction of their affairs, and a committee of eight, who, as\r\nthe executive body, should carry into effect the determinations of the\r\ncouncil. Their credits were divided into shares, called _Luoghi_, and\r\nthey took the title of the Bank, or Company of St. Giorgio. Having thus\r\narranged their government, the city fell into fresh difficulties, and\r\napplied to San Giorgio for assistance, which, being wealthy and well\r\nmanaged, was able to afford the required aid. On the other hand, as the\r\ncity had at first conceded the customs, she next began to assign towns,\r\ncastles, or territories, as security for moneys received; and this\r\npractice has proceeded to such a length, from the necessities of the\r\nstate, and the accommodation by the San Giorgio, that the latter now\r\nhas under its administration most of the towns and cities in the Genoese\r\ndominion. These the Bank governs and protects, and every year sends its\r\ndeputies, appointed by vote, without any interference on the part of the\r\nrepublic. Hence the affections of the citizens are transferred from the\r\ngovernment to the San Giorgio, on account of the tyranny of the\r\nformer, and the excellent regulations adopted by the latter. Hence also\r\noriginate the frequent changes of the republic, which is sometimes\r\nunder a citizen, and at other times governed by a stranger; for the\r\nmagistracy, and not the San Giorgio, changes the government. So when\r\nthe Fregosi and the Adorni were in opposition, as the government of the\r\nrepublic was the prize for which they strove, the greater part of the\r\ncitizens withdrew and left it to the victor. The only interference of\r\nthe Bank of St. Giorgio is when one party has obtained a superiority\r\nover the other, to bind the victor to the observance of its laws, which\r\nup to this time have not been changed; for as it possesses arms, money,\r\nand influence, they could not be altered without incurring the imminent\r\nrisk of a dangerous rebellion. This establishment presents an\r\ninstance of what in all the republics, either described or imagined\r\nby philosophers, has never been thought of; exhibiting within the same\r\ncommunity, and among the same citizens, liberty and tyranny, integrity\r\nand corruption, justice and injustice; for this establishment preserves\r\nin the city many ancient and venerable customs; and should it happen (as\r\nin time it easily may) that the San Giorgio should have possession of\r\nthe whole city, the republic will become more distinguished than that of\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nAgostino Fregoso conceded Serezana to the San Giorgio, which readily\r\naccepted it, undertook its defense, put a fleet to sea, and sent forces\r\nto Pietra Santa to prevent all attempts of the Florentines, whose\r\ncamp was in the immediate vicinity. The Florentines found it would be\r\nessentially necessary to gain possession of Pietra Santa, for without\r\nit the acquisition of Serezana lost much of its value, being situated\r\nbetween the latter place and Pisa; but they could not, consistently\r\nwith the treaty, besiege it, unless the people of Pietra Santa, or its\r\ngarrison, were to impede their acquisition of Serezana. To induce the\r\nenemy to do this, the Florentines sent from Pisa to the camp a quantity\r\nof provisions and military stores, accompanied by a very weak escort;\r\nthat the people of Pietra Santa might have little cause for fear, and by\r\nthe richness of the booty be tempted to the attack. The plan succeeded\r\naccording to their expectation; for the inhabitants of Pietra Santa,\r\nattracted by the rich prize took possession of it.\r\n\r\nThis gave legitimate occasion to the Florentines to undertake operations\r\nagainst them; so leaving Serezana they encamped before Pietra Santa,\r\nwhich was very populous, and made a gallant defense. The Florentines\r\nplanted their artillery in the plain, and formed a rampart upon the\r\nhill, that they might also attack the place on that side. Jacopo\r\nGuicciardini was commissary of the army; and while the siege of Pietra\r\nSanta was going on, the Genoese took and burned the fortress of Vada,\r\nand, landing their forces, plundered the surrounding country. Biongianni\r\nGianfigliazzi was sent against them, with a body of horse and foot, and\r\nchecked their audacity, so that they pursued their depredations less\r\nboldly. The fleet continuing its efforts went to Livorno, and by\r\npontoons and other means approached the new tower, playing their\r\nartillery upon it for several days, but being unable to make any\r\nimpression they withdrew.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Florentines proceeded slowly against Pietra Santa,\r\nand the enemy taking courage attacked and took their works upon the\r\nhill. This was effected with so much glory, and struck such a panic into\r\nthe Florentines, that they were almost ready to raise the siege, and\r\nactually retreated a distance of four miles; for their generals thought\r\nthat they would retire to winter quarters, it being now October, and\r\nmake no further attempt till the return of spring.\r\n\r\nWhen the discomfiture was known at Florence, the government was filled\r\nwith indignation; and, to impart fresh vigor to the enterprise, and\r\nrestore the reputation of their forces, they immediately appointed\r\nAntonio Pucci and Bernardo del Neri commissaries, who, with vast sums of\r\nmoney, proceeded to the army, and intimated the heavy displeasure of the\r\nSignory, and of the whole city, if they did not return to the walls; and\r\nwhat a disgrace, if so large an army and so many generals, having only\r\na small garrison to contend with, could not conquer so poor and weak\r\na place. They explained the immediate and future advantages that would\r\nresult from the acquisition, and spoke so forcibly upon the subject,\r\nthat all became anxious to renew the attack. They resolved, in the first\r\nplace, to recover the rampart upon the hill; and here it was evident how\r\ngreatly humanity, affability, and condescension influence the minds of\r\nsoldiers; for Antonio Pucci, by encouraging one and promising another,\r\nshaking hands with this man and embracing that, induced them to proceed\r\nto the charge with such impetuosity, that they gained possession of\r\nthe rampart in an instant. However, the victory was not unattended by\r\nmisfortune, for Count Antonio da Marciano was killed by a cannon shot.\r\nThis success filled the townspeople with so much terror, that they began\r\nto make proposals for capitulation; and to invest the surrender with\r\nimposing solemnity, Lorenzo de' Medici came to the camp, when, after a\r\nfew days, the fortress was given up. It being now winter, the leaders of\r\nthe expedition thought it unadvisable to make any further effort until\r\nthe return of spring, more particularly because the autumnal air had\r\nbeen so unhealthy that numbers were affected by it. Antonio Pucci and\r\nBiongianni Gianfigliazzi were taken ill and died, to the great regret\r\nof all, so greatly had Antonio's conduct at Pietra Santa endeared him to\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nUpon the taking of Pietra Santa, the Lucchese sent ambassadors to\r\nFlorence, to demand its surrender to their republic, on account of its\r\nhaving previously belonged to them, and because, as they alleged, it was\r\nin the conditions that places taken by either party were to be restored\r\nto their original possessors. The Florentines did not deny the articles,\r\nbut replied that they did not know whether, by the treaty between\r\nthemselves and the Genoese, which was then under discussion, it would\r\nhave to be given up or not, and therefore could not reply to that point\r\nat present; but in case of its restitution, it would first be necessary\r\nfor the Lucchese to reimburse them for the expenses they had incurred\r\nand the injury they had suffered, in the death of so many citizens; and\r\nthat when this was satisfactorily arranged, they might entertain hopes\r\nof obtaining the place.\r\n\r\nThe whole winter was consumed in negotiations between the Florentines\r\nand Genoese, which, by the pope's intervention, were carried on at Rome;\r\nbut not being concluded upon the return of spring, the Florentines would\r\nhave attacked Serezana had they not been prevented by the illness of\r\nLorenzo de' Medici, and the war between the pope and King Ferrando; for\r\nLorenzo was afflicted not only by the gout, which seemed hereditary in\r\nhis family, but also by violent pains in the stomach, and was compelled\r\nto go the baths for relief.\r\n\r\nThe more important reason was furnished by the war, of which this was\r\nthe origin. The city of L'Aquila, though subject to the kingdom of\r\nNaples, was in a manner free; and the Count di Montorio possessed great\r\ninfluence over it. The duke of Calabria was upon the banks of the Tronto\r\nwith his men-at-arms, under pretense of appeasing some disturbances\r\namong the peasantry; but really with a design of reducing L'Aquila\r\nentirely under the king's authority, and sent for the Count di Montorio,\r\nas if to consult him upon the business he pretended then to have in\r\nhand. The count obeyed without the least suspicion, and on his arrival\r\nwas made prisoner by the duke and sent to Naples. When this circumstance\r\nbecame known at L'Aquila, the anger of the inhabitants arose to the\r\nhighest pitch; taking arms they killed Antonio Cencinello, commissary\r\nfor the king, and with him some inhabitants known partisans of his\r\nmajesty. The L'Aquilani, in order to have a defender in their rebellion,\r\nraised the banner of the church, and sent envoys to the pope, to submit\r\ntheir city and themselves to him, beseeching that he would defend them\r\nas his own subjects against the tyranny of the king. The pontiff gladly\r\nundertook their defense, for he had both public and private reasons for\r\nhating that monarch; and Signor Roberto of San Severino, an enemy of the\r\nduke of Milan, being disengaged, was appointed to take the command\r\nof his forces, and sent for with all speed to Rome. He entreated\r\nthe friends and relatives of the Count di Montorio to withdraw their\r\nallegiance from the king, and induced the princes of Altimura, Salerno,\r\nand Bisignano to take arms against him. The king, finding himself so\r\nsuddenly involved in war, had recourse to the Florentines and the duke\r\nof Milan for assistance. The Florentines hesitated with regard to their\r\nown conduct, for they felt all the inconvenience of neglecting their own\r\naffairs to attend to those of others, and hostilities against the church\r\nseemed likely to involve much risk. However, being under the obligation\r\nof a League, they preferred their honor to convenience or security,\r\nengaged the Orsini, and sent all their own forces under the Count\r\ndi Pitigliano toward Rome, to the assistance of the king. The latter\r\ndivided his forces into two parts; one, under the duke of Calabria, he\r\nsent toward Rome, which, being joined by the Florentines, opposed the\r\narmy of the church; with the other, under his own command, he attacked\r\nthe barons, and the war was prosecuted with various success on both\r\nsides. At length, the king, being universally victorious, peace was\r\nconcluded by the intervention of the ambassadors of the king of Spain,\r\nin August, 1486, to which the pope consented; for having found fortune\r\nopposed to him he was not disposed to tempt it further. In this treaty\r\nall the powers of Italy were united, except the Genoese, who were\r\nomitted as rebels against the republic of Milan, and unjust occupiers of\r\nterritories belonging to the Florentines. Upon the peace being ratified,\r\nRoberto da San Severino, having been during the war a treacherous ally\r\nof the church, and by no means formidable to her enemies, left Rome;\r\nbeing followed by the forces of the duke and the Florentines, after\r\npassing Cesena, found them near him, and urging his flight reached\r\nRavenna with less than a hundred horse. Of his forces, part were\r\nreceived into the duke's service, and part were plundered by the\r\npeasantry. The king, being reconciled with his barons, put to death\r\nJacopo Coppola and Antonello d'Aversa and their sons, for having, during\r\nthe war, betrayed his secrets to the pope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe pope becomes attached to the Florentines--The Genoese\r\nseize Serezanello--They are routed by the Florentines--Serezana\r\nsurrenders--Genoa submits to the duke of Milan--War between the\r\nVenetians and the Dutch--Osimo revolts from the church--Count Girolamo\r\nRiario, lord of Furli, slain by a conspiracy--Galeotto, lord of Faenza,\r\nis murdered by the treachery of his wife--The government of the city\r\noffered to the Florentines--Disturbances in Sienna--Death of Lorenzo\r\nde' Medici--His eulogy--Establishment of his family--Estates bought by\r\nLorenzo--His anxiety for the defense of Florence--His taste for arts and\r\nliterature--The university of Pisa--The estimation of Lorenzo by other\r\nprinces.\r\n\r\nThe pope having observed in the course of the war, how promptly and\r\nearnestly the Florentines adhered to their alliances, although he had\r\npreviously been opposed to them from his attachment to the Genoese,\r\nand the assistance they had rendered to the king, now evinced a more\r\namicable disposition, and received their ambassadors with greater favor\r\nthan previously. Lorenzo de' Medici, being made acquainted with this\r\nchange of feeling, encouraged it with the utmost solicitude; for he\r\nthought it would be of great advantage, if to the friendship of the king\r\nhe could add that of the pontiff. The pope had a son named Francesco,\r\nupon whom designing to bestow states and attach friends who might be\r\nuseful to him after his own death, saw no safer connection in Italy\r\nthan Lorenzo's, and therefore induced the latter to give him one of his\r\ndaughters in marriage. Having formed this alliance, the pope desired the\r\nGenoese to concede Serezana to the Florentines, insisting that they had\r\nno right to detain what Agostino had sold, nor was Agostino justified\r\nin making over to the Bank of San Giorgio what was not his own. However,\r\nhis holiness did not succeed with them; for the Genoese, during these\r\ntransactions at Rome, armed several vessels, and, unknown to the\r\nFlorentines, landed three thousand foot, attacked Serezanello, situated\r\nabove Serezana, plundered and burnt the town near it, and then,\r\ndirecting their artillery against the fortress, fired upon it with their\r\nutmost energy. This assault was new and unexpected by the Florentines,\r\nwho immediately assembled their forces under Virginio Orsino, at Pisa,\r\nand complained to the pope, that while he was endeavoring to establish\r\npeace, the Genoese had renewed their attack upon them. They then sent\r\nPiero Corsini to Lucca, that by his presence he might keep the city\r\nfaithful; and Pagolantonio Soderini to Venice, to learn how that\r\nrepublic was disposed. They demanded assistance of the king and of\r\nSignor Lodovico, but obtained it from neither; for the king expressed\r\napprehensions of the Turkish fleet, and Lodovico made excuses, but sent\r\nno aid. Thus the Florentines in their own wars are almost always\r\nobliged to stand alone, and find no friends to assist them with the same\r\nreadiness they practice toward others. Nor did they, on this desertion\r\nof their allies (it being nothing new to them) give way to despondency;\r\nfor having assembled a large army under Jacopo Guicciardini and Pietro\r\nVettori, they sent it against the enemy, who had encamped upon the\r\nriver Magra, at the same time pressing Serezanello with mines and every\r\nspecies of attack. The commissaries being resolved to relieve the place,\r\nan engagement ensued, when the Genoese were routed, and Lodovico dal\r\nFiesco, with several other principal men, made prisoners. The Serezanesi\r\nwere not so depressed at their defeat as to be willing to surrender,\r\nbut obstinately prepared for their defense, while the Florentine\r\ncommissaries proceeded with their operations, and instances of valor\r\noccurred on both sides. The siege being protracted by a variety of\r\nfortune, Lorenzo de' Medici resolved to go to the camp, and on his\r\narrival the troops acquired fresh courage, while that of the enemy\r\nseemed to fail; for perceiving the obstinacy of the Florentines' attack,\r\nand the delay of the Genoese in coming to their relief, they surrendered\r\nto Lorenzo, without asking conditions, and none were treated with\r\nseverity except two or three who were leaders of the rebellion. During\r\nthe siege, Lodovico had sent troops to Pontremoli, as if with an\r\nintention of assisting the Florentines; but having secret correspondence\r\nin Genoa, a party was raised there, who, by the aid of these forces,\r\ngave the city to the duke of Milan.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Dutch made war upon the Venetians, and Boccolino of\r\nOsimo, in the Marca, caused that place to revolt from the pope, and\r\nassumed the sovereignty. After a variety of fortune, he was induced to\r\nrestore the city to the pontiff and come to Florence, where, under the\r\nprotection of Lorenzo de' Medici, by whose advice he had been prevailed\r\nupon to submit, he lived long and respected. He afterward went to Milan,\r\nbut did not experience such generous treatment; for Lodovico caused him\r\nto be put to death. The Venetians were routed by the Dutch, near the\r\ncity of Trento, and Roberto da S. Severino, their captain, was slain.\r\nAfter this defeat, the Venetians, with their usual good fortune, made\r\npeace with the Dutch, not as vanquished, but as conquerors, so honorable\r\nwere the terms they obtained.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, there arose serious troubles in Romagna. Francesco\r\nd'Orso, of Furli, was a man of great authority in that city, and\r\nbecame suspected by the count Girolamo, who often threatened him. He\r\nconsequently, living under great apprehensions, was advised by his\r\nfriends to provide for his own safety, by the immediate adoption of such\r\na course as would relieve him from all further fear of the count. Having\r\nconsidered the matter and resolved to attempt it, they fixed upon the\r\nmarket day, at Furli, as most suitable for their purpose; for many of\r\ntheir friends being sure to come from the country, they might make\r\nuse of their services without having to bring them expressly for the\r\noccasion. It was the month of May, when most Italians take supper by\r\ndaylight. The conspirators thought the most convenient hour would be\r\nafter the count had finished his repast; for his household being then\r\nat their meal, he would remain in the chamber almost alone. Having\r\nfixed upon the hour, Francesco went to the count's residence, left\r\nhis companions in the hall, proceeded to his apartment, and desired an\r\nattendant to say he wished for an interview. He was admitted, and after\r\na few words of pretended communication, slew him, and calling to his\r\nassociates, killed the attendant. The governor of the place coming by\r\naccident to speak with the count, and entering the apartment with a few\r\nof his people, was also slain. After this slaughter, and in the midst\r\nof a great tumult, the count's body was thrown from the window, and with\r\nthe cry of \"church and liberty,\" they roused the people (who hated the\r\navarice and cruelty of the count) to arms, and having plundered his\r\nhouse, made the Countess Caterina and her children prisoners. The\r\nfortress alone had to be taken to bring the enterprise to a successful\r\nissue; but the Castellan would not consent to its surrender. They begged\r\nthe countess would desire him to comply with their wish, which she\r\npromised to do, if they would allow her to go into the fortress,\r\nleaving her children as security for the performance of her promise. The\r\nconspirators trusted her, and permitted her to enter; but as soon as she\r\nwas within, she threatened them with death and every kind of torture in\r\nrevenge for the murder of her husband; and upon their menacing her with\r\nthe death of her children, she said she had the means of getting more.\r\nFinding they were not supported by the pope, and that Lodovico\r\nSforza, uncle to the countess, had sent forces to her assistance, the\r\nconspirators became terrified, and taking with them whatever property\r\nthey could carry off, they fled to Citta di Castello. The countess\r\nrecovered the state, and avenged the death of her husband with the\r\nutmost cruelty. The Florentines hearing of the count's death, took\r\noccasion to recover the fortress of Piancaldoli, of which he had\r\nformerly deprived them, and, on sending some forces, captured it; but\r\nCecco, the famous engineer, lost his life during the siege.\r\n\r\nTo this disturbance in Romagna, another in that province, no less\r\nimportant, has to be added. Galeotto, lord of Faenza, had married the\r\ndaughter of Giovanni Bentivogli, prince of Bologna. She, either through\r\njealousy or ill treatment by her husband, or from the depravity of her\r\nown nature, hated him to such a degree, that she determined to deprive\r\nhim of his possessions and his life; and pretending sickness, she took\r\nto her bed, where, having induced Galeotto to visit her, he was slain by\r\nassassins, whom she had concealed for that purpose in the apartment.\r\nShe had acquainted her father with her design, and he hoped, on his\r\nson-in-law's death, to become lord of Faenza. A great tumult arose as\r\nsoon as the murder was known, the widow, with an infant son, fled into\r\nthe fortress, the people took up arms, Giovanni Bentivogli, with a\r\ncondottiere of the duke of Milan, named Bergamino, engaged for the\r\noccasion, entered Faenza with a considerable force, and Antonio Boscoli,\r\nthe Florentine commissary, was also there. These leaders being together,\r\nand discoursing of the government of the place, the men of Val di\r\nLamona, who had risen unanimously upon learning what had occurred,\r\nattacked Giovanni and Bergamino, the latter of whom they slew, made the\r\nformer prisoner, and raising the cry of \"Astorre and the Florentines,\"\r\noffered the city to the commissary. These events being known at\r\nFlorence, gave general offense; however, they set Giovanni and his\r\ndaughter at liberty, and by the universal desire of the people, took\r\nthe city and Astorre under their protection. Besides these, after\r\nthe principal differences of the greater powers were composed, during\r\nseveral years tumults prevailed in Romagna, the Marca, and Sienna,\r\nwhich, as they are unimportant, it will be needless to recount. When\r\nthe duke of Calabria, after the war of 1478, had left the country, the\r\ndistractions of Sienna became more frequent, and after many changes, in\r\nwhich, first the plebeians, and then the nobility, were victorious, the\r\nlatter and length maintained the superiority, and among them Pandolfo\r\nand Jacopo Petrucci obtained the greatest influence, so that the former\r\nbeing distinguished for prudence and the latter for resolution, they\r\nbecame almost princes in the city.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines after the war of Serezana, lived in great prosperity\r\nuntil 1492, when Lorenzo de' Medici died; for he having put a stop to\r\nthe internal wars of Italy, and by his wisdom and authority established\r\npeace, turned his thoughts to the advancement of his own and the city's\r\ninterests, and married Piero, his eldest son, to Alfonsina, daughter of\r\nthe Cavaliere Orsino. He caused Giovanni, his second son, to be raised\r\nto the dignity of cardinal. This was the more remarkable from its being\r\nunprecedented; for he was only fourteen years of age when admitted to\r\nthe college; and became the medium by which his family attained to the\r\nhighest earthly glory. He was unable to make any particular provision\r\nfor Guiliano, his third son, on account of his tender years, and\r\nthe shortness of his own life. Of his daughters, one married Jacopo\r\nSalviati; another, Francesco Cibo; the third, Piero Ridolfi; and the\r\nfourth, whom, in order to keep his house united, he had married to\r\nGiovanni de' Medici, died. In his commercial affairs he was very\r\nunfortunate, from the improper conduct of his agents, who in all their\r\nproceedings assumed the deportment of princes rather than of private\r\npersons; so that in many places, much of his property was wasted, and\r\nhe had to be relieved by his country with large sums of money. To\r\navoid similar inconvenience, he withdrew from mercantile pursuits,\r\nand invested his property in land and houses, as being less liable to\r\nvicissitude. In the districts of Prato, Pisa, and the Val di Pesa, he\r\npurchased extensively, and erected buildings, which for magnificence\r\nand utility, were quite of regal character. He next undertook the\r\nimprovement of the city, and as many parts were unoccupied by buildings,\r\nhe caused new streets to be erected in them, of great beauty, and thus\r\nenlarged the accommodation of the inhabitants. To enjoy his power in\r\nsecurity and repose, and conquer or resist his enemies at a distance, in\r\nthe direction of Bologna he fortified the castle of Firenzuola,\r\nsituated in the midst of the Appennines; toward Sienna he commenced the\r\nrestoration and fortification of the Poggio Imperiale; and he shut out\r\nthe enemy in the direction of Genoa, by the acquisition of Pietra Santa\r\nand Serezana. For the greater safety of the city, he kept in pay the\r\nBaglioni, at Perugia, and the Vitelli, at Citta di Castello, and held\r\nthe government of Faenza wholly in his own power; all which greatly\r\ncontributed to the repose and prosperity of Florence. In peaceful times,\r\nhe frequently entertained the people with feasts, and exhibitions of\r\nvarious events and triumphs of antiquity; his object being to keep the\r\ncity abundantly supplied, the people united, and the nobility honored.\r\nHe was a great admirer of excellence in the arts, and a patron of\r\nliterary men, of which Agnolo da Montepulciano, Cristofero Landini, and\r\nDemetrius Chalcondylas, a Greek, may afford sufficient proofs. On this\r\naccount, Count Giovanni della Mirandola, a man of almost supernatural\r\ngenius, after visiting every court of Europe, induced by the munificence\r\nof Lorenzo, established his abode at Florence. He took great delight\r\nin architecture, music, and poetry, many of his comments and poetical\r\ncompositions still remaining. To facilitate the study of literature\r\nto the youth of Florence, he opened a university at Pisa, which was\r\nconducted by the most distinguished men in Italy. For Mariano da\r\nChinazano, a friar of the order of St. Augustine, and an excellent\r\npreacher, he built a monastery in the neighborhood of Florence. He\r\nenjoyed much favor both from fortune and from the Almighty; all his\r\nenterprises were brought to a prosperous termination, while his enemies\r\nwere unfortunate; for, besides the conspiracy of the Pazzi, an attempt\r\nwas made to murder him in the Carmine, by Batista Frescobaldi, and a\r\nsimilar one by Baldinetto da Pistoja, at his villa; but these persons,\r\nwith their confederates, came to the end their crimes deserved. His\r\nskill, prudence, and fortune, were acknowledged with admiration, not\r\nonly by the princes of Italy, but by those of distant countries; for\r\nMatthias, king of Hungary, gave him many proofs of his regard; the\r\nsultan sent ambassadors to him with valuable presents, and the Turkish\r\nemperor placed in his hands Bernardo Bandini, the murderer of his\r\nbrother. These circumstances raised his fame throughout Italy, and his\r\nreputation for prudence constantly increased; for in council he was\r\neloquent and acute, wise in determination, and prompt and resolute\r\nin execution. Nor can vices be alleged against him to sully so many\r\nvirtues; though he was fond of women, pleased with the company of\r\nfacetious and satirical men, and amused with the games of the nursery,\r\nmore than seemed consistent with so great a character; for he was\r\nfrequently seen playing with his children, and partaking of their\r\ninfantine sports; so that whoever considers this gravity and\r\ncheerfulness, will find united in him dispositions which seem almost\r\nincompatible with each other. In his later years, he was greatly\r\nafflicted; besides the gout, he was troubled with excruciating pains in\r\nthe stomach, of which he died in April, 1492, in the forty-fourth year\r\nof his age; nor was there ever in Florence, or even in Italy, one so\r\ncelebrated for wisdom, or for whose loss such universal regret was felt.\r\nAs from his death the greatest devastation would shortly ensue, the\r\nheavens gave many evident tokens of its approach; among other signs,\r\nthe highest pinnacle of the church of Santa Reparata was struck with\r\nlightning, and great part of it thrown down, to the terror and amazement\r\nof everyone. The citizens and all the princes of Italy mourned for him,\r\nand sent their ambassadors to Florence, to condole with the city on the\r\noccasion; and the justness of their grief was shortly after apparent;\r\nfor being deprived of his counsel, his survivors were unable either to\r\nsatisfy or restrain the ambition of Lodovico Sforza, tutor to the duke\r\nof Milan; and hence, soon after the death of Lorenzo, those evil plants\r\nbegan to germinate, which in a little time ruined Italy, and continue to\r\nkeep her in desolation.",
