Mr. Smooth was born\r\nand \"growed\" on the extreme south point of Cape Cod--a seemingly\r\ndesolate spot, yet somewhat renowned as the birthplace of Long Tom\r\nCoffin. If I would select one of our nation's 'cutest sons; if I were\r\ncalled upon to name the kind of man with that in his natural\r\ncomposition to make the safest, shrewdest, and most calculating\r\nmerchant; if I were called to pass judgment on the man most qualified\r\nto sustain the spirit and characteristics of the American nation\r\nabroad--one who would never betray our national energy, nor degrade\r\nhis profession, nor fail to seek that which might promote the\r\ninterests of those who reposed trust in him, at the same time never\r\nforgetting his own--if I were about forming an expedition, and would\r\nprovide myself with that character of man upon whom the issue of its\r\nsuccess most depends; if, I say, I would seek the man possessing those\r\nrigid qualities of a moral nature which are a sure protection against\r\ndoing aught that may degrade the councils of a nation, I would make\r\nthis sandy cape my starting point, and draw from the upward growth of\r\nthat stern energy to be found among those flourishing, energetic, and\r\nintelligent communities embraced within that circle which terminates\r\nat Cape Ann, and between the circling arms of which two capes heaves\r\nBoston Bay. But Smooth, though somewhat primitive in his personal\r\nappearance, is none of your common Cape Cod coasters, such as your\r\nCaptain Doanes, and Cooks, and Ryders, and Clapps. Not he! So slender\r\nof person is he, that there can be no particular impropriety in our\r\ndrawing a comparison between him and that peculiar type of per son\r\ncommonly called a Virginian bean-pole. Nor, when he gets himself (as\r\nis not uncommon with him) \"all over\" native brown homespun, does his\r\nconfiguration materially change, there yet remaining, and boldly\r\nrefusing to be disguised, that face so full of penetration, and those\r\nfeatures so sharp. The waggishly inclined have identified them with\r\nthe wizardry of dividing storm currents. Nevertheless, of this lean\r\nconformation, which is better within than the world without is in\r\ngeneral willing to admit, is Smooth particularly proud. In manner,\r\nSmooth is piquant; and being an acknowledged member of the fast\r\nschool--that is, a disciple of manifest destiny in particular and\r\nModel Republics in general--he accepts the mission so kindly proffered\r\nhim by his unfortunate friend, Mr. General Pierce, and has no\r\nobjection to giving the world and kingcraft (the latter rudderless,\r\nand drifting on those quicksands of common sense which it were well\r\nfor nations had they proved destructive centuries ago) a few lessons\r\nin the go-ahead principle. What Smooth means to convey by the go-ahead\r\nprinciple, is simply that when common sense triumphs universal in a\r\nnation, sycophantism dies, and with it that pest of peoples,\r\nkingcraft! So, with the most amiable intentions, does Solomon set out\r\nfor Washington, to have a first talk with General Pierce: this talk he\r\nhopes will be a prelude to putting straight the nationalities now\r\ndrifting on the rock of intrigue, without that safety-valve which a\r\npeople fully conscious of enjoying their rights can give. And while\r\nthus employed, Smooth does not forget that it is a well laid down rule\r\nthat many small Presidents may talk very large and yet cut very\r\nridiculous figures: hence his first talk with Mr. Pierce, who is well\r\nknown for general and very respectable characteristics, may be\r\nproductive of great good to mankind in a mass. In New England\r\neducated, (that land where niggers may be white men, and white men too\r\noften turn niggers), loving universal rights, peace to consolidate a\r\nnation's good, and keep down that martial spirit which is its\r\ncankering curse--being tenacious of freedom in its broadest\r\nacceptation, and commercial prosperity with a general diffusion of its\r\nresults, it is Mr. Smooth's candid opinion that ere another century\r\nrolls into the page of time America will whip, feed, civilize, and\r\nrepublicanize the great American continent. Could this be done at an\r\nearlier period, so much the better for mankind in general. Smooth was\r\nborne out in this opinion from the fact that Europe had got into a\r\ngreat fuzzle, the result of which was an equally great fight. Kingdoms\r\nand empires had become disordered, their craft was stranded;\r\npotentates were turning their people into minions of slaughter.\r\nNicholas (modest god of all the Russias) thought his murdering a few\r\nthousands an act most pious: it was all for the sake of Christianity\r\nand a very small holy _rite!_ On the other hand, there was Mister John\r\nBull, so dogged at times, and yet so hard to hold once his propensity\r\nfor fighting somebody was excited, hurling very unchristian lead and\r\nsteel into. Nicholas's subtle-headed serfs. But the thing most\r\nwondrous was, that Uncle John, now foaming with the fever of war, had\r\ngot Johnny Crappo at his back instead of his belly--a fact that would\r\nbe recorded on the strangest page of history. Strange fighting\r\ncompanions were they; but as pig and dog do now and then become\r\nbed-fellows, who can give too much expression to his surprise at this\r\nstrange Anglo-French combination? Let the world say what it will with\r\nreference to our worthy friend Uncle John fighting the battle of\r\nMohamedanism--let it lay at his door the grave charge of degrading\r\nhimself by seeking to make firm the rotten props of one of the most\r\ndebased governments that has stained the history of the world with its\r\ncrimes, John will humanely acknowledge the charge while forwarding to\r\nTurkey a copious edition of his \"Society for Promoting Christian\r\nKnowledge.\"\r\n\r\nWe hope with Mr. Smooth, that Master Bull and Cousin Jonathan may war\r\nonly in words. Both are sensible gentlemen; both are keenly alive to\r\nthat inspiration called fighting for one's rights; both are for ever\r\nfinding a small bone to snarl over; but peace is found the greater\r\nbone, which, by preserving, affords the best picking. Indeed, we must\r\nall admit, that if polite diplomatists and small politicians had their\r\nway, their naughty recriminations would give us plenty of war, with\r\nonly bows and smiles to pay for the blood and treasure wasted. But\r\nMr. Bull is considerate with his power; while Jonathan shrewdly\r\ncalculates how much being embroiled in war will disturb his tin\r\nbusiness. May our discretion continue to form the best defence against\r\nwar between the most enlightened governments of christendom.\r\n\r\nAt home our negro question bids very fair to get political parties\r\ninto an interminable snarl; which said snarl is made worse by the\r\nsingular hopes of those having friends who would like to be next\r\nPresident of the United States. The \"white house,\" (that shrine of\r\npatriotic worship!) having its avenues strongly bolted and barred with\r\nformidable niggers from Virginia and Carolina, has become a mammon of\r\nfaith before which politicians are making sad niggers of themselves.\r\nMr. Solomon Smooth lamented this; and, in order to ascertain what\r\ncould be done in the way of finding a remedy, he determined to plainly\r\nintroduce the matter during his first talk with General Pierce;--in a\r\nword, to see what could be done in the way of straightening things ere\r\nhe tried the quality of his cigars and Bourbouin whiskey, a large\r\nstock of which the General was known to keep on hand. The party to\r\nwhich Mr. Smooth belonged, \"Young America,\" enrolled among its numbers\r\nmany young gentlemen whose spirits were fast, and young ladies whose\r\ntalents were fast increasing; hence it was that he was a firm believer\r\nin the elastic principles of a go-ahead government: such an one,\r\nalbeit, as would republicanize Russia, knock Austria into a smash, or\r\nmake her declare herself something--revolutionize Europe in general,\r\nand in particular teach kings of the christian faith how very\r\nunchristian it is to wage savage wars. In addition to this, he would\r\nhave the world in general more enlightened, and kings made to know\r\nthat their highest duty was to mould their conduct after the example\r\nof good citizens. Were this not enough, he would go for annexing to\r\nthese \"United States\" all the rest of creation; Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica in particular, to aid which object he would have the moon\r\nperform a specific part on behalf of manifest destiny.\r\n\r\nThe reader must remember that our hero Smooth is a man most\r\nunpolished, though never so bad as he seems. But we will let him speak\r\nfor himself, and as his letters are addressed to Uncle Sam, of course\r\nthose may read who will.\r\n\r\n_Enough from the Editor_.\r\n\r\nWHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n        JUNE, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMR. SOLOMON SMOOTH IN WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Dear Uncle--Once upon a time you were called Sam; but now that the\r\nreign of Pierce is upon us it is difficult to tell what you may not be\r\ncalled. Not long since you were the son of greatness, you are now the\r\nshadow of Pierce--the man whose little light posterity will snuff\r\nout. I have thought of you frequently, Uncle: I have seen you in\r\nsorrow looking back upon the past, and my heart has beat with sympathy\r\nas I saw you contrast it with the present. Once patriotism stood on\r\nmanly feet, now Bunkam reigns. Politics are turned into drum-sticks,\r\nparties are lost for want of a policy, principles are buried in the\r\nmarket-place. Mr. Smooth has been long accustomed to hard knocks and\r\ncrooked places; but anything so crooked as Mr. Pierce staggers his\r\ndigestion. If the concentrated wisdom of the nation riots here\r\n(thought I as I entered the city) who can gainsay my coming? I knew\r\nthe atmosphere I entered had foul malaria in it; the city I found as\r\nstraight as the face of parties on the other hand was deformed. But\r\nbeing in the federal city, I became forcibly impressed with the fact,\r\nthat your smallest man has the largest expectations, though he will\r\nnot object to become the nation's drone. Having made this wonderful\r\ndiscovery, I took up my line of march for the National Hotel, a\r\ngorgeous palace where an uncouth million meet to revel in cheap\r\nluxury. So large was the house that a pilot to guide me through its\r\nthousand galleries to bed was an indispensable necessity. I was\r\nfatigued, and cared not where I hung up. Large as was the\r\nestablishment, everything looked so costly that I became cautious lest\r\nwhat I sat down upon might become soiled, in which event I might be\r\ncompelled to pay the shot with a short locker; or, should the case go\r\nbefore Pierce, he might in the profundity of his wisdom exile me to\r\nsome remote spot on the Mosquito coast. I walked into the\r\nestablishment like one who feels himself an independent citizen, and\r\nthen commenced looking at the place and the people, as the people\r\ncommenced looking at me. Returning looks, and question-asking, seemed\r\nthe fashion. 'Stranger!' said a well dressed but rather inquisitive\r\nindividual, 'you must, to be anybody in this place, smother yourself\r\nin dignity, and eat dough-nuts of Southern make. Large quantities of\r\nthis diet are made now at the White House; in fact Pierce has turned\r\nthe establishment into a factory, where that article is manufactured\r\n_ad libitum_, and all are expected to eat.' I thought the person who\r\nthus accosted me had large experience of matters in general, for he\r\ngave me a slanting wink and a cunning nudge, which I rendered into an\r\ninsinuation to stand treat. I affected not to understand him, and\r\nedging aside a pace, made a bold effort to gain the long and very\r\nexpensive mahogany counter that stretched half across the office, and\r\nbehind which glowed out the figure of a fat citizen, whom I stared\r\nright in the face. You cannot get cleverly through this world without\r\nbrass; if in your face you have enough to establish a foundery, so\r\nmuch the better. It is indispensable in political matters; and,\r\nwhether right or wrong, the reader can best judge. I have thought the\r\nsmaller the politician, the larger were his dealings in the article.\r\nNo one could be more cautious how they scandalized their neighbours\r\nthan I am; this, Uncle Sam, you well know; but I question the policy\r\nof being delicate during the reign of Pierce, whose cabinet recalls to\r\nmy mind the story of the clacking hen, that forever kept up a noise\r\nwithout laying one egg. To make your way in Washington, you must storm\r\nand put to route a whole platform of valiant gentlemen, who have\r\nbecome political images in brass. As they love you, Uncle Sam, so also\r\nwould they live upon you, die upon you, be buried at your expense, and\r\ntheir friends be very angry were you not a mourner at the\r\nfuneral. This I, Smooth, declare an honest fact, notwithstanding the\r\nhigh respect I entertain for all those patriotic gentlemen who would\r\ntake such care of my Uncle's affairs.\r\n\r\n\"Now, this very phlegmatic and good natured citizen, who stood: behind\r\nthe mahogany, had a face as broad and placid as a town-clock seen by\r\nmoonlight. His figure, too, was tightly driven into a suit of\r\nextravagant cloth, and altogether presented the appearance of having\r\nquite recently escaped from the hands of James, his tailor. It was not\r\nin the power of man to analyze his character from what he said, for\r\nwhat he said meant nothing, when judged by the world's wisdom; but you\r\nsaw that James had succeeded in making him in love with himself.\r\nShould he chance to read this imperfect sketch, he will excuse me when\r\nI say he seemed a person brought up to himself, and entertaining the\r\nhope that at no distant day he would become a very important\r\ncharacter--perhaps outshine General Pierce himself. He looked at me,\r\nand I looked at him; then he grinned at me, and I grinned at him. At\r\nlast I said, I reckoned we might draw the game. I then added, that\r\nfrom the look of the establishment I could not be wrong in assuming\r\nthat they did a large business in the way of feeding hungry\r\npoliticians and honester people. 'You may stake some on that, old\r\nfeller,' says he, with a suspicious leer. His nasal was somewhat\r\nstrong, so I put him down as from Vermont State, perhaps from the more\r\nmountainous part of it. As if shy of my patronage he upon the counter,\r\npompous, spread his hands, as if the mahogany was all his. This\r\nseeming indifference rather touched my dignity, which was of tender\r\nquality, so I cast upon him a look he could not misinterpret,\r\ninquiring if he could tie a body up for the night in a spare corner.\r\n'You may bet on that! got a spare pin we can hook ye on somehow, I\r\nreckon;' he ejaculates, sprawling his elbows, and making a support of\r\nhis fleshy hands, from between which his face peered like a soft\r\npumpkin sorely squeezed. In this position he stared, and stared, until\r\nhis countenance assumed an anxiety, equalled only by that of a stump\r\nlecturer about inaugration time--say one, who had hoped for the\r\nmission to the court of St. James, but as a matter of patriotism would\r\nnot decline the Dublin Consulship. At length he condescended to say,\r\nwith an air of languishing endurance, that 'he could do me up brown,\r\nin the way of comfortable quarters.' I thanked him for his great\r\nkindness, said I wanted to exercise a judicious economy, and could not\r\ndo the extensive, like those persons sprawling in easy arm chairs at\r\nthe left hand corner, to whom I pointed, and who, like Mr. President\r\nPierce's representatives abroad, were making a great noise to no\r\npurpose. After looking quizically at the tie-up under my arm, then at\r\nmy tall white hat, and again at the coarse weave of my homespun, he\r\ninquired if that (pointing to the bundle) constituted my\r\nbaggage. Instantly I told him it was none of his business; that there\r\nwas no occasion for his feeling so large, though Mr. Pierce was\r\nPresident. He made an upright of himself, and very civilly rejoined\r\nthat there was no place this side of Cape Horn--and he doubted if\r\nthere was on the other side--where it was so necessary to see the\r\ncolateral as this Washington. He was proceeding to say much more, and\r\nsomething about the doubtful character of General Pierce and his\r\nfriends, when I interrupted by saying, I thought he must have\r\nforgotten my name. 'Smooth is my name,' I reiterated, 'of the Young\r\nAmerican party, the party that intends doing up the manifest destiny\r\nfor mankind.'\r\n\r\n\"'Manifest destiny never pays debts: must see the collateral 'afore we\r\ntie ye up! Fact is, stranger, we must have the hold-fast for fear of\r\nthe shot falling short. The General has got so many tin-less friends,\r\nwho visit Washington on a small affair of business (here he gave his\r\nshoulders a significant shrug), that a body has to keep a sharp eye in\r\nthe wind.' Suddenly he began to drum on the mahogany, screw his face\r\ninto a disc of puckers, and look so wise. So glad did he seem, that he\r\nwhistled Yankee Doodle with the variations, looked every which way,\r\nand then laughed right out at what he called Smooth's outfit.\r\n\r\n\"'Needn't laugh at the fixens--old feller!' says I, 'Uncle Sam and me\r\nare going into the tin business, and Sam, being a generous old butt,\r\nwill stand all the treats and hotel bills. Besides that, I was born in\r\nthe very sand heap where Tom Coffin was raised.'\r\n\r\n\"'Who cares for Tom' says he, turning aside, and making a polite bow\r\nto a thirsty senator from the far west: the senatorial gent bent his\r\nneck over, and approaching with his lips the ear of the important\r\nindividual, whispered something from out the smallest corner. This\r\nsomething, when translated into decent English, might be rendered\r\nthus:--If justice and gin slings are administered at your bar, pray\r\ndirect me the way to it! The fat man pointed up a narrow, dark, and\r\nvery long passage; and then suddenly turning to me, he said: 'If Tom\r\nCoffin lived now-a-days, when politics went on the fast, he wouldn't\r\nbe worth shooks, he not having a vote, nor wanting an office under the\r\nnew administration.' 'Now, stranger,' says I, directing a look as if I\r\nwas going to strike something at him, 'don't make such a fuss about\r\nthe needful--look'a here!' I just plumps out Uncle Zack Brewster's\r\nletter, and having fascinated his eye, tells him how Cochran and Riggs\r\n'll do the dust. Like an hydraulic current let loose did the fellow\r\nprick up his ears: then he said, '_do_ tell,' with a musical emphasis\r\nthat seemed so full of credit. Again he drew a long breath, and a\r\nseriousness came over his face that could only be likened to that of a\r\nSouth Carolina locomotive when drawing a whole convention of\r\nsecessionists, who, having failed in devising means to dissolve the\r\n'federal union,' were returning homeward very melancholy.\r\n\r\n\"'Never doubted Mr. Smooth's word,' says he, with simple\r\ndryness,--'but, notwithstanding, painful is the experience that\r\noffice-holders and seekers, though always kind to Uncle Sam, and\r\ntenacious of his dignity and cashbag, seldom maintain the same\r\nearnestness for their own when legitimates are left in the key-hole.'\r\n\r\n\"'You mean that the General's friends don't shine over on the square?'\r\n\r\n\"'Precisely so!--Mr. General Pierce himself is a sort of mixed stripe;\r\nbut his friends (and he has regiments of them!), all fighters in the\r\nMexican war when he was brigadier, expect so much something material\r\nfor themselves that all _outsiders_ are forgotten. Now and then the\r\nGeneral is sorry to inform his many friends that he is a little ill;\r\nto which a voice here and there is heard to say that he is not\r\ninclined to do the clean thing.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, I saw what the feller wanted; so I pulled out a fist full of\r\nshiners, just to show him what Young America could do. The seeing the\r\ndimes smoothed him down into the most agreeable amiability. His face\r\nloomed out with good natur, his feelings seemed coming right from his\r\ninards; and he struck up Yankee Doodle by way of an offset.\r\n\r\n\"'Pooty full, Mr. Smooth,' he generously remarked, 'but we must try\r\naccommodate you somehow! We'll tuck you away in a spare corner, high\r\nup!'\r\n\r\n\"'That's a good soul,' said I,--'know'd ye warn't a bad sort of\r\nfellow,--when a body understood how to get the good out!'\r\n\r\n\"'Apartments for Solomon Smooth, Esq., from Cape Cod,' he said,\r\nmutteringly, looking over his book, and drumming with his fingers on\r\nthe page. Mr. Smooth, in proof of his fast principles, will have no\r\nobjection to tying up in the seventh story?'\r\n\r\n\"'Rather stiff that, Major! Young America can do most anything,--hang\r\nup on a pin if it be necessary to accommodate, but don't just like the\r\nmoon for a bedfellow.'\r\n\r\n\"'Won't trouble you with a bedfellow, Mr. Smooth,' he, grinned out,\r\nshaking all over his broad sides.\r\n\r\n\"It being well understood in Washington that great men were most\r\ncondescending, while little men, with large expectations, were most\r\naspiring, there was nothing left but to cut a course between the two.\r\nAs for the latter quality of gentlemen, they never stood at trifles,\r\nand when they failed to get the big business, had not the slightest\r\nobjection to the small,--which was the doing all Mr. President\r\nPierce's thinking. Therefore, be it known that, with a full knowledge\r\nof this sad state of affairs, did I write down:--'Mr. Solomon Smooth,\r\nfrom Cape Cod:' which, when down, looked like the footprints of a hen\r\nthat, having dipped her claws in an inkstand, had waddled across the\r\npage. Thus ended my induction at the National.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMR. SMOOTH SUPS, AND GOES TO BED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At length, Uncle Sam, I found myself somebody; and while looking\r\nabout me on the many well-dressed and very good-natured gentlemen who\r\nsubsisted on the hope of your generosity, could not avoid the\r\ncontemplation of what a glorious world this of ours must be,\r\npossessing as it does so many good hearted souls like yourself, so\r\nrich--but as indifferent to their own best interests. 'You will take\r\nsupper, Mr. Smooth?' inquired the man behind the mahogany. Before I\r\nhad time to speak, he pulled a bell that jingled like Jehu. And then\r\nthere came scampering in a school of negroes, so tidy, trim, and\r\nintelligent. One bowed--another smiled--a third waited with a\r\nsalutation my commands. 'Take care of Mister Smooth!' again spoke the\r\nman behind the mahogany, as with an effort to be commanding in accent.\r\nThat they might know more emphatically (as Uncle Tom Benton says) that\r\nMr. Smooth was none of your common citizen, I turned my eyes on the\r\ndarkies, and stared at them until they turned pale. Then one possessed\r\nhimself of my bundle: moving off with a scientific motion, and a bow\r\n_a la cabinet_, he bid me follow. Obeying his summons, onward we went,\r\nthrough a long, dark passage, and into a spacious hall up stairs,\r\nwhere he said they eat their people. No sooner was I bowed to a seat\r\nthan a dozen gentlemen darkies set upon me in good earnest; so fast\r\ndid they beset me with eatables that I begun to think they had\r\nmistaken me for a thanksgiving turkey about to be fatted for the table\r\nof the secretary of the treasury. The fixins, as Mr. Samuel Slick\r\nwould say, made one feel quite at home; not so with the darkies: they\r\nrecognizing my home spun, soon became sassy; whereupon I turned round\r\nand set upon _them_ with the broadest grin I could summon. Nor could I\r\nwithhold a laugh at seeing them laugh. 'Reckon how mas'r's on big\r\nbusiness to Washington wid Mr. General Pierce,' says one, whose face\r\nwas black, and bright, and full of the quizzical; while another, with\r\na flat crooked nose gave a cunning wink out of his left eye. This\r\nbeing detected by a superior, in the brisk person of a son of the\r\nEmerald Isle, who stood well six feet in his boots, a 'soucer' with\r\nthe broad front of his knuckle bones, between the colored gentleman's\r\ntwo eyes, was the rejoinder--a most striking remonstrance, that laid\r\nhim measuring the floor. Troth! an' it's myself 'd stop yer\r\nbotheration. Sure, ye dark spalpeens, is it by the same token ye'd\r\ntrate the gintleman? (Here the honest son of sweet Erin showed signs\r\nof his Doneybrook getting the better of him.) 'Myself 'll take care of\r\nMr. Smooth--doesn't he belong to the self same party, the\r\nknow-nothings? The divil a such a country, as Hamirike: an' it's the\r\nboys from Donegal that 'ud be taking her dignity in care.' Saying\r\nthis, Mr. Patrick (for such was his name) stretched the whole length\r\nof his important self over the table, and says:--I'm yers to the\r\nbuckle of my shoe, Mr. Smooth! It's a divil a one but yerself I'll\r\nvote for at the next helection. Sure, an' didn't mysel jine the native\r\nHamerikan party, with Tom Connolly, afore we'd been two months on the\r\nbeloved soil an', sure, it's Tom and myself that's goin to put through\r\nthe _nonothin_ for ye.' Here Mr. Patrick anxiously paused for a\r\nreply. To never say a bad thing when I could not think of a good, ever\r\nhas been my motto; so I returned his good nature with saying:--'Give\r\nus yer hand, Mr. Patrick--we will forget the two, and yet be one! and\r\nthat our faith may be made strong, we will together do brown the\r\npatriotism of these United States.\r\n\r\n\"'Ye better believe that!' returns Mr. Patrick, with an exultation of\r\nhappiness; and concluding with: 'I'd kill every nager in the land, be\r\nthe pipers I would! an' it's the boys from old Ireland what does be\r\nkeeping the bright face on pure Hamirikan principles. Sure an' warn't\r\nit the brave boys that halicted Gineral Pierce and his cumrades?' Here\r\nMr. Patrick again paused, and with a wise look, shook his head. 'We\r\nput the broad staunch face on the democracy,' again he interjaculated\r\nwith a mutter. Indeed, Mr. Patrick the reader will easily detect, had\r\nthe crude idea of right in his head; but, unfortunately, he could only\r\nget it out in these simple and sideling insinuations. The negro, whom\r\nwe have before described as being knocked down, picked himself up and\r\nhad nothing to say.\r\n\r\n\"'There may be much in what you say, friend Patrick,' said I: 'The\r\nboys from Donegal do with the elective franchise much that\r\n_native-Homers_ in their carelessness leave undone. Mr. Patrick\r\nacknowledged this, shook his head, and said the fact, though\r\ndeplorable, was preeminently established.\r\n\r\n\"'Like every one who visits Washington these times, yer a friend of\r\nthe Gineral's, and have fit with him in the Mexican war?' again he\r\ninquired, seeming to anticipate my answer. Of the Mexicans I know\r\nlittle--of the war less: it were well our country made peace its\r\nfriend, war its enemy. As to the General and his fighting in Mexico,\r\nthat was a matter that best affected himself; through it he became a\r\ngreat potentate, but not so great a man; but, I accept the general\r\nidea that he is now become troubled of a short memory. During this\r\ntime I had not forgotten number one--my supper! Having stowed it well\r\naway under my lining, I felt very much like a man who had just turned\r\naway his back on Secretary Marcy, having through personal friendship\r\nreceived the country's best collectorship. Seeing the point of\r\ngood-nature to which my feelings had arrived through the strong\r\nargument of meats, Mr. Patrick proffered his services to navigate me\r\nout of the place where he ate his people--through entries, corridors,\r\npassages, halls, and down stairways, along which we were ever\r\nencountering persons who, like Mr. Pierce, were groping their way in\r\nthe dark. In the course of time, and after much feeling and fumbling,\r\nI again encountered the light of the mahogany counter, behind which\r\nstood the same individual I have before described--his person so\r\nformidable, his face so full and fat, his hair so sleek and smooth.\r\n\r\n\"'Had a good supper, Squire Smooth?' says he, a broad smile spreading\r\nover his broader face. On answering in the affirmative, he introduced\r\nme to numerous unsatisfied politicians. One of this very numerous\r\ngentry, and of whom I had, unfortunately, occasion to know more at a\r\nsubsequent period, (he was a man of grief from South Carolina), swore,\r\nby his knowledge of southern rights and secession, that his State, so\r\nneglected, would certainly go out of the Union. She had not a minister\r\nabroad--only Consul General at Alexandria, which was said by the\r\nknowing ones to be somewhere in Egypt; and where, to prove his strong\r\nfaith in southern principles, and his independent indifference to the\r\nfeelings of thin-skin northerners, he had purchased two very handsome\r\nNubian slaves of the feminine gender. This was merely to illustrate\r\nthe truly American spirit of our institutions: perchance it might\r\narouse from his stupor the Viceroy, who not fully cognizant of the\r\nheight of civilization to which America had arrived, was making\r\nsingular, and to me very praiseworthy efforts, to free his people from\r\nthe curse of enslaving men. To our patriotic Consul General we say--go\r\nit!--a few more such examples will give the Egyptian an impression of\r\nour liberty and christian love most strange: the brilliant light of\r\nour western star will, I fear, have much in it to remind him of those\r\ndarker days when his forefathers built pyramids.\r\n\r\n\"'Come to see the Gineral, I s'pose, stranger?' our Carolinian\r\ninquired, with a suspicious look, touching a companion beside him on\r\nthe arm. To his inquiry I returned--nothing shorter! 'Cape Cod,' he\r\nfollowed with a respectful bow, 'did noble work for the true\r\ndemocracy; she is great in sands, shoals, and cod-fish; she will send\r\nGeneral Pierce a chowder, as emblematic of his foreign policy--' Here\r\nI interrupted by assuring him that Cape Cod could stand anything to\r\nthe stomach digestible; But whether she could digest the General was a\r\ndoubtful question. Cape Cod, be it known over the broad acres of this\r\nland, I added, has a spirit above living on government: she turned\r\ndisdainfully from the means that were fast turning the functions of\r\ngovernment into a machine for grinding out patronage--she never\r\nsacrificed Uncle Sam for the sake of what is in his tin-trunk. At\r\nthis, which he was pleased to call an expletive, he begun to summon\r\nhis dignity: at once he stiffened in a manner that proved how much\r\nsuperior to me he considered himself, and how much more of Uncle Sam's\r\nshiners were necessary to his conceived maintenance. 'Cape Cod is the\r\nplace,' says he folding his arms, moving to a more piquant position,\r\ngiving his person a little more importance, and making a target of the\r\nbrightly polished stove, against which he permitted a well-directed\r\nstream of dark fluid to explode ere he wiped his lips.--'Cape Cod is\r\nthe place from whence all persons come who profess to be born free and\r\nequal; but they are a scrubby set--' Considering it a duty I owed to\r\nthe nation, I again interrupted him. 'Cape Cod,' replied I, 'has got\r\ngumption, principle, and the spirit of a go-ahead in her: she\r\ngerminated the Young American party. Understand, citizen, (here I\r\nfound spunk was necessary), a cape-coaster can at any time boast a\r\nfull fair of fish; if he draw them from Mr. John Bull's waters, so\r\nmuch the better. He is no stranger to Mr. John Bull, whom he esteems\r\nrather a dogged fellow, pugnaciously inclined at times, but never so\r\nbad as he seems; and though stubbornly behind the age of progress, nor\r\nwilling to believe in the principles of manifest destiny, often\r\nimproves upon acquaintance.'\r\n\r\n\"'Good night, Mr. Smooth,' said he hurriedly; 'when you tie up for the\r\nnight--remember me--! Hope to see you bright in the morning.' Off,\r\nlike the handle of a jug, he went. And now it being time to stow\r\nmyself away, I hailed for a pilot to navigate me safe into the seventh\r\nstory. My fat friend at the counter, whose eyes were becoming leaden,\r\nrung again the bell, and out scampered some dozen darkies from nobody\r\ncould discern where. I looked at the negroes with an expression of\r\nexcitement, and then, somewhat alarmed:--'Stranger,' says I, 'these\r\n'ere niggers a'int all going to put me through, be they?' He said he\r\nreckoned one would do; and to a question as to what time I would\r\ncomplete the journey to bed, he replied that seeing I was of the Young\r\nAmerican stripe, and that the distinguished of that party could do\r\nalmost anything, provided I started soon I would reach the destination\r\nabout midnight. 'Now, providing it's any accommodation, Mr. Smooth, we\r\ncan send you to bed by steam. Say the word and up you'll go!' he\r\nrapidly concluded, rapping with his fingers on the big book he had so\r\nleisurely laid aside for the night, there being no chance of another\r\ncustomer being caught this side of twelve o'clock. I shook my head and\r\nmoved off, telling him I did not appreciate being busted up. 'Ain't a\r\nmite of danger!' says he: 'why, stranger, we havn't killed more nor\r\ntwo dozen this year or more.' That Young America was a go-ahead I was\r\nfully conscious; still, being somewhat anxious to extend a little\r\nfriendly advice to Gineral Pierce, I begged to be excused from all\r\ndangers, Young America must live to proclaim the manifest destiny of a\r\nuniversal republic. You may lay aside your steam fixings until a more\r\nexpedient time to use them--'Here he interrupted by saying my walking\r\nup would only save six cents;--' can put Mr. Smooth into the machine\r\nand send him up in a jiffy. Further, we have got some dozen old gents\r\nhere who go to bed by steam every night!' I shook hands with the\r\nfellow, exchanged glances, bid them good night all round, and trotted\r\noff, following the darky, who wound his way round corridors, up\r\nstairs, and through passages for more than an hour, (at least, I\r\nthought it was!), until I fancied we had got lost in an interminable\r\nlabyrinth of narrow passages. It was just after inauguration, which\r\nfact was duly made known through the medium of sundry corks of\r\nchampagne bottles, which were sounding pop! pop!! pop!!! Again merry\r\nvoices were heard announcing the misfortunes of those about to pass\r\nout: while another whose voice seemed somewhat mellow, said he had in\r\nhis eye the office he wanted--exactly. A third voice, as if echoed\r\nthrough a subterranean vault, said they must all be forbearing--the\r\nGeneral was so undecided in his opinions. Pretty soon, the negro,\r\nhaving wound his way high up in the world, turned a corner, gave a\r\ntremendous guffaw, and opened the door of a place that looked very\r\nmuch like a closet in which to stow away lean lawyers. 'Now, Cuff! ye\r\nain't goin to stow this citizen away in that ar place, be ye?' says I.\r\n\r\n\"'Mas'r,' returns he, ''tis just the snuggest place ye ever did see;\r\nwhy! tain't da length on ye, seem how mas'r can double himself up\r\nanyhow,--just as Gineral Pierce do.' The darkey laughed and drew back\r\nwith a bow, as I began to philosophise that, being now so well up in\r\nthe world, it was the best policy to coil up and invoke\r\nMorpheus,--which I did, bidding good-night to all below, and promising\r\nmyself a pleasant interview with General Pierce on the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nIN WHICH MR. SMOOTH HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL CASS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Smooth had just stowed himself away in the shape of a figure 4, when\r\nthere came a voice as husky as Uncle Zack Peabody's conk, (which said\r\nconk had been used to blow his way through the fogs of Newfoundland\r\nfor nearly half a century), saying:--'It's mighty tight squeezing\r\nthere, ain't it, stranger?' Where the voice came from seemed a puzzle\r\nfor all creation. No room was there in the place for another soul--all\r\nbecame as still and watchlike as the tomb. In fear and anxiety I gazed\r\nupon the dark wall, and along it to the little window facing the\r\navenue; and there, behold! but tell it not in the Capitol, was the\r\nbroad, burly face of General Cass, like a wet moon in discontent.\r\nUnhappy with himself, he was peering in at the window. Again he\r\nmuttered:--'I can't get in!--such has always been my fate.' The\r\nmuch-disappointed old gentleman bore such an expression of\r\ndiscomfiture on his countenance, that Smooth was forced to the\r\nconclusion that to be sociable would only be doing a good turn--more\r\nespecially as the General and Uncle Sam never got along well together.\r\n'Then it's you, General?' says I: 'well, don't be in a hurry!' After a\r\nshort silence, he inquired if I could accommodate a traveller who had\r\nbeen long on the road, and short of shot. I said I was not well to do\r\nfor room; but as to be obliging was the order of the day, and seeing\r\nthat he was soon to try another turn by joining the 'Young American'\r\nparty, I would see what could be done. He had got upon the roof of the\r\ninstitution,--just where he could slip backward with great ease,\r\nthough it took some effort to go forward. Being somewhat infirm of\r\nage, I took him gently by the hand and assisted him in, where I\r\nthought he might, if he pleased, stand upon a square platform. The\r\nGeneral was very polite, bore strongly in his demeanor the marks of\r\ntime and honor; I could not suppress the capricious thought--that it\r\nwas time a sly corner in the patent office were provided for political\r\nrelics of a past age, and he safely stowed away in it. All things of a\r\nby-gone age should have their place; notwithstanding, knowing that\r\nUncle Sam and him had tried to be intimate friends, and that he had\r\nmany warm and substantial voters in the far West, I felt to be less\r\nthan condescending would be bad political policy. He took a seat, and\r\nbegan to get up his good-nature, as I inquired what earthly mission he\r\ncould be prosecuting on so dark and cold a night.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, now, friend Smooth,' he says: 'I like you, but the question\r\nyou put so honestly has a point which you cannot see, though I can\r\npainfully feel. However, as I have no secrets, I don't mind telling\r\nyou: it must be private, nevertheless--I am sensitive not to have\r\nthese matters spread all over the Union. To-night, you see, a conclave\r\nof political wranglers met below, in this house. Conscious that they\r\nwould have a large '_grin_' at me, discussing the means by which I\r\nhave always been the rejected of this great and growing people, I came\r\nthat my ears might lesson of fools. To this end, I mounted the\r\nchimney, and was reconoitering down the black abyss, when my eye\r\nturned and caught your light, like a star in tribulation, twinkling\r\nfrom the window. Strange kind of a tribune for a senator, I admit, but\r\nI heard many judgments, and from them may draw many more. One\r\nreckoned I had stamped with the cold hand of death my political life;\r\nalways wanting to fight somebody--the English in particular! Another\r\nsaid Virginia and Pennsylvania couldn't approve of my policy--that it\r\nwas too slow; while New York dare not vote for me, and I was New\r\nEngland's dread. A third said he didn't believe the middle West would\r\nback me up, because a doubt existed as to whether other States\r\nwould. These sentiments I heard from down chimney. My solemn belief\r\nis, that I have been sacrificed to a firm and honest belief in the\r\nMonroe doctrine; which, singularly enough, had its origin in English\r\nminds. My efforts to carry it into effect seemed not to form a\r\ntangible objection; though a voice now and then said it might lead to\r\nevil consequences, England and France having formed a very unnatural\r\nalliance to put down the aggressive spirit of nations, without respect\r\nto the side of the Atlantic on which they were domiciled. Then, by way\r\nof a suspending clause, they said it was not so much my pugnacious\r\npropensities they feared, as that, being an old _fogy_, full of\r\npersonal grievances against somebody, I would make the gratifying a\r\nvenerable spleen paramount to the interests of States (all this I\r\nheard from down chimney). That I was not a bad man, nor an inflexible\r\nman, they all agreed; but that my time was passed was their verdict,\r\nand being passed, I would myself soon pass into political\r\noblivion--nothing being left but executive expectations and\r\nballet-boxes, with which I might build on high a monument! The trouble\r\nis, friend Smooth, I am not possessed of the tact of making the nation\r\nunderstand me; had I this all-necessary to political fame, the Chief\r\nMagistracy had long since been mine. To me the free press of our\r\ncountry is a sort of infernal machine,--its effect in my case\r\nstrengthens the idea. Having held me up as dangerous, when in truth I\r\nam a peaceably disposed man, they have wronged me while misinforming\r\nthe public.' Here he paused, as his face assumed its wonted\r\nseriousness, and that wart, now historical, looked brighter than\r\never. I had long been desirous of scraping acquaintance with the old\r\nman, whom I esteemed much better inside than out, so I offered him\r\nhalf of my shingle, at the same time intimating that we would have\r\nsome whiskey. At this he lowered his voice, and continued with a slow\r\nshake of the head:--'I'm not so bad as I seem. Peradventure I wanted a\r\nsmall chance at the Britishers. I hate them, but that only signifies a\r\ntrifle. Mr. Pierce, like a horn lantern for which Uncle Caleb and Jeff\r\nfurnish the light, is fast getting affairs into a fuzzle; this must be\r\nso while the light is thus furnished, and the regulation of its\r\nburning be left to Grandpapa Marcy. Fact is, you see, Mr. Smooth, the\r\nadministration is become like a steam-engine, Mr. Pierce being used as\r\na piston by Caleb, Jeff, and Co., who, in addition, furnish\r\nSouthern-rights for fuel, use patronage as a condenser, and make a\r\nsafety valve of Papa Marcy. But Papa has yet to take many lessons in\r\nNational Engineering before his control over the machine is complete.'\r\nI watched the old man's anxious eye as he spoke; and again suggested\r\nthe taking a little whiskey: I pitied him. 'It will set ye all right!'\r\nsays I, 'it'll take the fogyism all out, warm up yer inards, and make\r\nyer ideas come out with the philosophy of a _Mara beau_. Mr. Pierce\r\nloves to traffic in the language of war, but like all little\r\ncreatures, makes his noise and stops.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, in obedience to my friendship for you, Smooth--and with the\r\nknowledge that you are going into business with Uncle\r\nSam--appreciating the 'Young American' party as I do, I don't care if\r\nI take. It may revive the hope of 1856. After all, there is something\r\nin you New Englanders I like--give us yer hand,' he replied suddenly,\r\nas a soft smile spread over his hard face. He commenced wiping his\r\nlips, and was so polite. I rang the bell, and up came the negro, his\r\nface as full of alarm as a frightened moon in a hail-storm. Alarmed at\r\nhis appearance, the General sprang to his feet, and was for bolting\r\nthrough the window. 'Don't be scared, General!' says I, trying to\r\nsuppress a laugh; 'put on the pluck of Young America--niggers then\r\nwill seem as nothing.' Mr. Pierce pursues this course. General knows\r\nit takes somebody to cut a figure in the world; and seeing that these\r\nUnited States constitute a free country, what violation of principle\r\nis there in doing with negroes what you please? The steaming punch now\r\nawaited us; I filled the General's glass, and he said 'this was a\r\ngreat country, which would soon send Young America out on the world to\r\nproclaim manifest destiny.' I said amen, and the punch disappeared\r\ninto his depot, as he concluded. It was clear his inards warmed, he\r\nbeginning to brighten up soon after. With a laconic air, he touched me\r\non the elbow, and said, 'Somehow, it seems to touch the right place--I\r\ndeclare it does! I am half inclined to the belief that General Pierce\r\nsups formidably of this just before he talks about winding things up\r\nin a straight sort of way, all of which he ultimately forgets: the\r\ninfluence of this sort of steam was undoubtedly that which selected\r\nMinister Solan Borland the man for Central America. It was not that\r\nfriend Solan went to settle perplexing questions with that dwarf\r\ncombination of helpless governments; it was enough that he amused\r\nsundry citizens and much annoyed others with the little fracases\r\nwhich, through the power of political steam, he was wont to indulge\r\nin.'\r\n\r\n\"'Now, Uncle Cass!' said I, interrupting him, at the same time adding\r\na good-natured wink, 'you must excuse Smooth's seeming intrusiveness;\r\nbut, what do you think of annexation in general, and filibustering and\r\ntaking Cuba in particular?' At this, the General gave a knowing pause,\r\nscratched his head as if it was troubled with something, and then\r\nreplied with much dryness: 'Ah! the one is a subject popular to-day,\r\nthe other is fast becoming so: when both are equally popular, we may\r\nadvocate them with safety. Mr. Pierce understands this policy. That\r\nwhich is popular and holds out advantages must go down in our go-ahead\r\ncountry. According to the axiom of our Southern doctrines we must have\r\nCuba: she must be wedded in political bonds to Cape Florida; not for\r\nthe purpose of consolidating niggerdom, but merely to complete in that\r\ndirection the point of manifest destiny.'\r\n\r\n\"'Lord love yer political faith, General!' said I, rising up and\r\ntaking him firmly by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Ye'll do for the Young America, that ye will! There'll be no more\r\nold-fogyism--no more of the slow-coach school! Take another bumper,\r\nand you'll be ripe for the new party.' The General, with less dignity\r\nthan you might have supposed him capable of condescending to, filled\r\nhis glass, drew his chair back, threw his square figure well over the\r\narms, and roared right out until it became dangerous. At length he\r\nbegan to drink his whiskey, and that stopped his joy for a time. But\r\nhe soon broke out afresh. 'What on earth is the matter with you,\r\nstranger? you ain't going to make a shaking machine of your broad\r\nsides, be ye?' says I, giving him a look that would have pierced a\r\nstone wall.\r\n\r\n\"'You must excuse me, Mr. Smooth, but the principles of your party\r\nwould make anybody laugh; why!--its sprouting members are all growing\r\nout of their breeches. Where, in that stretchy imagination the party\r\npossesses, can you find a place for the moon, which of necessity must\r\nfollow in the train of annexation?' he inquires seriously.\r\n\r\n\"'Put it? Why, Gineral, you have been stowed away so long, keeping\r\ndog-watch over fogyism, that you don't comprehend how Uncle Sam has\r\nbeen transformed into a go-ahead chap to suit the times. Consul\r\nSaunders 'll bridge the Gulf Stream, and thus unite Cuba and Cape\r\nFlorida; and, his pockets well lined with letter-writing materials, be\r\nfirst to march over it and proclaim manifest destiny to the\r\nnatives. As for the moon, George will find a place in the compact for\r\nher.'\r\n\r\n\"'But, Mr. Smooth,' says he, 'what in the name of changes be you going\r\nto do with so many little kingdoms? A thousand years will scarcely\r\npeople our present domain! Now, Smooth, I'll cut out a small job for\r\nthe Young American party:--let them, just to give a specimen of their\r\nprinciples, step across to Europe and help Louis and Uncle John (I\r\nhate John, though) whip Nicholas, and turn vacillating, faithless\r\nAustria into a republic, with principle and spirit equal to her\r\nposition as a nation.' The General looked serious as he concluded--so\r\nfar as whipping Austria was concerned we would be only too glad did\r\nshe for once throw off her cowardice and afford us an opportunity. She\r\nhad long played at thimblerig with doty old Mr. John Bull, before\r\nwhose eyes she had placed the spectacles of fantasy, the changes of\r\nwhich the poor old gentleman's very refined sense and undeniable\r\ndiplomacy had not permitted him to comprehend. Austria was like the\r\nthief who set himself up as umpire to settle between two knaves of his\r\nown cloth, and, while he gave advice to both, was securing to himself\r\nthe very plunder which gave rise to the dispute. Nicholas, John Bull\r\nsaid, was a ruffian of the go-ahead school; but, of the three\r\nruffians, which shall we choose? history may be the teacher! Ruffians,\r\nhowever, may do good at times, in which sense Nicholas was entitled to\r\nmore consideration than Mister Bull, in his frenzy, was willing to\r\naccord. Thus saying, the General and me took another glass, shook\r\nhands, and bowed most politely. Again I stretched myself down for the\r\nnight, as he (promising to call again and have another talk)\r\ndisappeared out of the window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMR. SMOOTH'S DREAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Leaving Cass holding on at the slippery roof. I dreamed that the\r\nghost of Benton, in contemplation bestrode the summit of the Rocky\r\nMountains; that 'Young America,' like a Colossus with monster limbs\r\nstretched across a world, was endeavouring to wake from their stupor\r\nthe nations. With a voice like unto lazy thunder murmuring in the\r\ndistance was he proclaiming his hatred of kings, into whose dominions\r\nhe threatened to march great armies, and whom he described as curses\r\nsent upon the earth by the evil one: for the _Evil One_ sought to\r\npromote self, a means to which he found in those intrigues by which he\r\nmade strong his court--the same was the trade of kings. Again the\r\nvoice thundered forth--'Here are the instruments that have destroyed a\r\nworld of human beings, and for a selfish purpose gloated over the\r\nblood they had made run in torrents.' I looked, and behold! appeared\r\nthere before me a terrible devil, of hideous form having two great\r\nhorns, on one of the long sharp points of which was poised a king, on\r\nthe other a fat bishop in his lawn. The two perpetual mischief-makers,\r\nand desolators thus poised, he came with a hideous roar, threatening\r\nto drown them in the river of unrefined common sense. And then there\r\nwas written in broad letters of fire across the shoulders of this\r\nsturdy devil--'Kingcraft and Churchcraft have cursed the nations of\r\nthe earth, and turned to blight the blessings of the True God!' Again\r\nthis significant edict vanished, and in its place there came, as in\r\nletters of gold, 'Cheap Government and no Established Church--let the\r\nnations be ruled in wisdom and right!' This had reference to good old\r\nEngland, not America, for here bishops are known to be meek and good.\r\nAll this was a dream: but then there came, soaring giant-like, 'Young\r\nAmerica,' and manifest destiny which he spread over the land for the\r\nbenefit of mankind. Then there came a great darkness, followed by a\r\nlittle light that crept feebly onward as if fearing to spread itself\r\non the broad disc of the horoscope--it was the light of Mr. Pierce,\r\nbeneath which hovered doubtful devils. How rapacious they seemed! They\r\nsaw the doubts and fears of his little light, and would fain carry him\r\noff into purgatory ere it died out. But his saviours came: they were\r\nthe ghosts of those great lights that founded the pillars of our\r\nRepublicanism. Down they sat, in ghostly conclave, and with\r\ninstruments in hand set about driving away the carrier devils and\r\nworking the problem of Mr. Pierce's political policy. It was\r\nimpossible!--not all the trigonometry of which they were masters\r\nsufficed to aid them in the task. It seemed like attempting to solve\r\nthe principle of that which never had one. He stood on a platform of\r\nsections, each of which turned at a touch, and seemed giving way for\r\nwant of strength. Indeed, as beheld in the dream, he could play the\r\ngame of uncertainty through a dozen focuses. The jury of ghosts\r\nbecame sorely perplexed; then they began to put to him some very\r\nhonest questions, as to what his intentions really were. And while\r\ndoing this the spirit of Washington, arrayed in glory, looked down\r\nupon its feeble successor, and with an ironical smile shook its head.\r\n\r\n\"Then there came an unaccented voice from the little light--the light\r\nsaid to be the impersonation of Pierce; indeed, it was of kindred with\r\nthe shadow in that singular romance by Hawthorn, called the life of\r\nPierce! And the voice said:--'I shall be known by my practice.' Just\r\nthen the little light became dimmer, and turned away toward a long\r\ndark avenue, where the vista seemed studded with the faces of\r\ndisconsolate 'niggers.' At this the ghost of Webster yawned, and that\r\nof Calhoun scowled fiercely and contemptuously; while Clay's rubbed\r\nits eyes and wept tears of pity. Again all was darkness. Then there\r\ncame again the little light of which I have spoken;--it was the light\r\nof Mr. Pierce. It flickered and fluttered, and thus we identified\r\nit. 'We have to deal with Europe--with that happy alliance my very\r\namiable Lord Clarendon says is for purposes not alone in Europe. My\r\nlord's language, however, is so cleverly diplomatic--that is, it can\r\nbe made to mean anything or nothing,--as to need a translation. My\r\nlord means, that when it has served to curb the national ambition of\r\ncertain nations of Europe it may be turned to the same purpose in\r\nanother but more congenial hemisphere. Kossuth wants material\r\naid--such as saddles, tin, &c. &c. I would give it him, if he would\r\nteach Austria a lesson of honesty! Nevertheless, as to Louis himself I\r\nwould be extremely cautious, for being more a blower than a moulder,\r\nand having a peculiar talent for getting affairs very crooked, the\r\ninstrument in the man is of questionable ability;--indeed, in a crisis\r\nbetween nations, such an instrument should he examined with great\r\nskill and delicacy before being set in motion.' He spoke after this\r\nmanner, and quick as thought the spectacle vanished--it was but a\r\ndream? Not a ghost was seen; no lurid face cast its pale shadow over\r\nthe dark canvas; the pure spirit of Washington had departed in\r\nhopeless despair. I was about to read a prayer, when the dark canvas\r\nmoved aside, and there, real as life, sat on a slave's grave the\r\nimmaculate Brigadier;--he, reader, was sipping whiskey toddy, as if it\r\nwere his wont. Old Bunkum was the slave whose grave he sat upon. It\r\nwas a strange penance over the mound of one so old; and yet who in the\r\npolitical world that had not paid it? 'Why!--Bunkum, you are\r\nbarefoot;' a voice spoke.\r\n\r\n\"'Remember, old man, you must keep on the stiff,--it's as necessary to\r\nsuccess as it was to believe the old Constitution frigate could whip\r\nanything afloat.' It was the General who spoke to the ghost of Bunkum,\r\nwho, having risen from the grave, stood before him, moody and\r\ndespairing. In ecstasy he grasped the hand of the cold figure cried\r\nout that his soul's love was with him. But in his exuberance he let\r\nthe whiskey run over the green grave, into which the ghost soon\r\ndisappeared and left him alone to his contemplations. Bunkum, like\r\nBilly Bowlegs, who has too much sense for the great father, says he\r\nhas wandered through all weathers, and endured all kinds of political\r\nfarcery: now that he had become old, and served as long as the god of\r\nsacrifice, would they not let him rest in peace? Here the General\r\nseemed alone and forlorn: then he wept bitterly, until the ghost of\r\nBunkum in pity again appeared and with him sat upon the grave. The\r\nGeneral kindly took him by the hand, and in his ear whispered\r\nsomething, the only part of which became audible was--'When as\r\nPresident of this great country I became, I was bound--' Here the man\r\npaused. A kindlier feeling now came over Bunkum, in evidence of which\r\nhe motioned as if he would take another drop of whiskey with the\r\nPresident, or ask a favor he was delicate about broaching. For a man\r\nwho had so long looked upon things beneath him his reserve was to be\r\nappreciated, especially when viewed in comparison with the\r\nexpectations of those many numerous friends, all of whom expected\r\nforeign missions. Having chatted and sipped together a sufficient\r\nlength of time, and as Bunkum was about to say _good by_, he turned\r\nwith a half significant smile, and touching the General on the elbow,\r\nsaid:--'Ye ain't got a spare hat and pea-jacket to lend a body?'\r\n\r\n\"'Bless you, Bunkum, you are of the South!--anything you want is at\r\nyour bidding. New England (she's a trump!) can take care of herself;\r\nlet the storm threaten as it may, she never trips. We must do for\r\nKentuck and Carolina:--the black pig must have his swill if the rest\r\nfind an empty trough.' 'Thank you! thank you! General; our States\r\nwill stand firm to you--Bunkum himself never will forsake you;' spoke\r\nthus thankfully the ghost of the old man as it took leave of the old\r\nGeneral and disappeared. Here I awoke from my dream to painful\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA MORNING ADVENTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As Uncle Sam is equally careless of his language and cash, he will\r\nexcuse a crooked beginning and accept a straight ending. Contemplating\r\nmy crooked dream I confess I waked up without a straight idea in my\r\nhead. The fact was, I was waked up with such an incomprehensible\r\njingling, ringing, rumbling, and gonging, that I mistook its purport,\r\nand thought the Russians were bombarding the house. I was about\r\nlooking out of the window to see if the White House was all safe, when\r\na negro with a countenance blacker than vengeance protruded his fizzy\r\nhead into the door, and without a morsel of knocking commenced\r\ngrinning. 'Anything wanted for Major Smooth?' inquires he; and\r\nwithout waiting for an answer, catches up the bed, Smooth and all the\r\nfixins, and set them somewhat aside. 'Not so fast, Cuff!' said I;\r\n'Smooth is no Major--plain Mister Smooth from the Cape.'\r\n\r\n\"'Lor, Mas'r' replied the negro, interrupting me; 'when in Washington\r\nt'wont do to be a mite less than a Major-General. Every man what come\r\nto dis city widout his title better come widout himself. Our clerk\r\nwhat stand at the hogany counter be a General,--Jones, the ostler, be\r\na Colonel; and Wilkes what keep the oyster shop ober yonder be a\r\nMajor! As for Captains, they are as thick and of as little use as\r\nblackbirds. Will you take somethin?' The sagacious negro bowed, and\r\nwaited for a reply. I told him that being invited to a fish breakfast\r\nwith the General at the 'White House,' I would forbear to liquor until\r\nI had made my bow.\r\n\r\n\"'S'pose you'll take the customary gin cock-tail, Mr. Smooth?' the\r\nnegro rejoined, with an anxious air. Evincing my surprise at such a\r\nproposition, I assured him I did not know its meaning. 'Don't know\r\nwhat it is!' he exclaimed, with a deep sigh. 'A very fashionable\r\ndrink,' he continued; 'gemmen what see de General, and study national\r\naffairs, all take some on em in da mornin.'\r\n\r\n\"'Now, Cuff,' I rejoined, 'just tell the truth; you mean that in order\r\nto keep the dignity up, it is necessary to take something stiff in the\r\nmornin?'\r\n\r\n\"'Dat him, mas'r,' says he in reply, accompanying it with a broad\r\nguffaw. 'When mas'r bin to de White House, and seem serious, as if he\r\nain't got what he want, he put a cock-tail down to make de glorious\r\ncome up; it be a great anecdote for what mas'r call de blues.' The\r\ninterpretation of what the negro said was that it made a man feel as\r\nif he had the best office in Mr. Pierce's gift safe in his\r\npocket. Having a reasonable appreciation of a negro's statement, I\r\nconsented on the ground of its good qualities--thus represented--to\r\ntake a little. The negro left, but soon returned with it in his\r\nhand--all bittered and iced. Down it went, plump!--it cut away the\r\ncobwebs, made my inards fizzle, and the whole frame feel as lively as\r\na bee-hive. The negro said it was good--and I said I reckoned. And\r\nthen I 'turned out,' as they call it, broadside on. 'Great kingdom,'\r\nexclaimed the negro, giving me a slanting look from head to foot;\r\n'why, mas'r, dey must a growed ye in a guano country.'\r\n\r\n\"'Cuff! don't be sassy,' I replied. And then he very good-naturedly\r\ncommenced arranging my homespun. He fussed over me as if I were a mere\r\nsubstance to be transformed into anything Mr. Pierce might\r\nrequire. Then, to my utter astonishment, he apprised me of the fact of\r\nGeneral Cass having carried off my boots and breeches--adding that it\r\nwas a sort of mania with him, and for which he was not morally\r\naccountable. Then the negro began quizzing my person. One of my legs,\r\nhe said, was hard shell, the other a soft shell; however, to reconcile\r\nthe matter, he further added that the embodiment was exactly suited to\r\nMr. Pierce's principles, inasmuch as he could go between--which he\r\nalways aimed to do. He then said I must have pantaloons of the right\r\nstripe; because in Washington a man must look genteel, and have his\r\nunderstandings straight. It was no excuse that the General himself was\r\nan undecided Democrat; if he was round in some things, he was square\r\nin others,--that is he was round in policy, and square in periods. The\r\nNegro said he did not look so much at the cut of the pantaloons as the\r\nquality of the cloth, and its tenacity for stretching--according to\r\nthe expectations of the 'Young American' party.\r\n\r\n\"Upon this assurance, I ordered him to repair to the tailor's, which\r\nhe did, and was not long in returning and bringing with him a pair of\r\nfashionables suited to the times. 'Great country,' said he, holding\r\nthem before me and shaking his black sides with laughter. Into them I\r\nslid myself; the bottoms only reached a little below my knees. The\r\nnegro, with eyes like astonished stars, set upon the straps, and such\r\na tugging and pulling as there allowed! I began to think I was being\r\npulled in two, (after the fashion of Mister Pierce's promises and\r\nperformances), when Cato, (such was the negro's name), his face almost\r\nwhite with exertion, begged I would not be alarmed--that he would very\r\nsoon get them all right! In another minute something went--pop!\r\nSimultaneously with the report was my head driven clean through the\r\npine-board ceiling into a chamber unfortunately occupied by a lean old\r\nmaid of some forty-seven summers. 'Good mornin, missus,' I said,\r\ntrying to make a bow; 'hope I ain't intruding.' The old lady looked\r\nmighty streaked, and wouldn't be pacified, until I told her I was\r\nmerely giving a few feats, just to illustrate the principles of the\r\n'Young American' party. It's only Young America, ma'am, he's cutting\r\nthe three figures of his sentiments, as made known by his particular\r\nstars,--Soule, Saunders, and Sickles. Didn't intend to disturb you, my\r\ngood woman,' says I. I wanted to seem polite--to put the very best\r\nfoot forward; but it was to no earthly use. The old critter screamed,\r\njumped out of the bed, and like a ghost shaking his cotton to the\r\nstorm, ran away in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"'Good Christopher Columbus!' exclaimed the negro, almost bursting\r\nwith fright. With this he commenced pulling and jerking at my legs,\r\nuntil, finding his efforts useless, he hastened down stairs and spread\r\nthe alarm. Major Smooth was in an alarming situation!--'most\r\ndying!--would breathe his last!--warn't no help fo'h him!--must die,\r\nsartin!! Such a ringing and dinging of bells, such a tampering up\r\nstairs, such a puffing and blowing of excited citizens as followed,\r\nnever was heard or seen before. Although in a tight place, I was\r\nneither alarmed nor crest fallen. Indeed, I thought I'd enjoin the old\r\nlady on the other side to enter upon the discussion of a political\r\nquestion, just by way of keeping up the characteristic sociability of\r\nthe nation. Presently about a dozen dangerously excited faces\r\npresented themselves in the room. 'He's gone, certain,' says one;\r\n'Major Smooth's a cold chicken,' mutters another; 'Young America's\r\ncutting a figure,' rejoins a third; 'he's only at rest while\r\nperforming some overt act,' interposes a fourth. 'Much you know about\r\nit!' says I, cool as Labrador: 'I merely put my head through this ere\r\nplace for the purpose of being friendly with this lone female\r\nlodger--pull me out!' In right good earnest they seized me by the\r\nboots, saying:--'Let us bring Young America into a respectable\r\nposition;' and with the most unmerciful jerks they laid me measuring\r\nthe floor. In no wise disconcerted, I picked myself up, and inquired\r\nif they had another strap to loan me. With the exception of Cato, the\r\nnegro, they all enjoyed a good laugh; he had no sooner relieved me,\r\nthan he commenced raising a fuss about my damaging the ceiling--never\r\nfor once taking Mr. Smooth's head into consideration. Young America,\r\nhe said, was always too fast--always getting into trouble and calling\r\nupon others to help him out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMR. SMOOTH FINDS HIS PATH TO THE WHITE HOUSE A DIFFICULT ONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Good morning, Mr. Smooth!' saluted the fat man behind the mahogany,\r\nas I entered the office, having escaped from my perilous position in\r\nthe seventh story. In addition, he took a lunar observation all along\r\ndown my hull, which he said was a mighty tough sort of craft, and had\r\nreceived no damage for which the house could be held responsible.\r\n\r\n\"As if to make the picture more complete, a number of anxious-looking\r\nindividuals (all firm friends of Uncle Sam) crowded about me, each\r\nputting some curious question in reference to my expectations and the\r\nExecutive and his gifts. Many of these important gentry had\r\nproboscises largely developed and very red; indeed, the reddest nose\r\nwas strongest evidence of the best office-seeker; albeit, some\r\nwaggishly inclined gentleman had said that the most generously\r\nred-nosed man always esteemed his deserts to be no less than that of\r\nUnited States Minister at some very fashionable foreign Court, where\r\nthe good red of a well-developed nose was significant of pure\r\nblood. 'Well now, gents,' I returned, 'you needn't be trying to poke\r\nyour political fun at this citizen! Young America is all right\r\nyet. Put me on the track of Mr. Pierce's whereabouts.' Seeing they\r\nwere facetiously inclined, I summoned that independence so necessary\r\nto a citizen of standing. At this moment, one more politely inclined\r\nthan the rest, stepped forward, and commenced giving me the ins and\r\nouts of the way to see the Brigadier, who, lie said, was surrounded by\r\nmany fairweather courtiers. Stepping politely to the door, he, with\r\ngrace not unbecoming, raised a well-gloved hand, and half\r\nwhispered:--Mr. Smooth will walk into the avenue--keep on the West\r\nside--join the throng (they are all officials in embryo)--be sure and\r\nlook as serious as they do; and with them you will arrive at the\r\n'White House' to take your place and chance.' Oh! chance! 'There is no\r\nmissing the way, Mr. Smooth; get behind some well-dressed citizen--one\r\nwho looks as if he were in pursuit of something the means of securing\r\nwhich he had made sure. Follow that man!' I thanked him for his\r\ncivility,--he seemed one of Uncle Sam's bone-breakers, and sallied out\r\nunder the happy contemplation that a gentleman from Cape Cod was on a\r\npar with the same species of mankind from South Carolina. It was true\r\nthat with what little aristocracy we boasted--and in that little there\r\nwas truly a great blessing, inasmuch as it illustrated the fact of\r\nthere being one spot on this earth where common sense had got the\r\nbetter of refined sense--was founded in the possession of 'niggers,'\r\nthe number giving rank in the scale. In the small but very\r\naristocratic atmosphere of democratic South Carolina it had been\r\nproposed to establish an order of the American garter, the means\r\nentitling to membership being the possession of a very large number of\r\nfat negroes and negresses: and to ingratiate the august order it was\r\nproposed to make Colonel Wade Hampton first knight, and Lady Tyler\r\nfirst knightess. The reader, Mr. Smooth feels assured, will pardon\r\nthis little digression, which he will set down to my love for that\r\ndarling little State.\r\n\r\n\"I soon muddled my way along with the crowd, among which there were\r\nvery long faces, very short faces, and faces from which nothing could\r\nbe extracted--the comic faces always kept behind! As a matter of\r\npolicy I got behind the man who had the longest and most quizzical\r\nface; for he gave out signs of seeing daylight through political\r\ndarkness. I made his acquaintance, and found him of the free-and-easy\r\nschool. 'On your way to see the General, stranger?' I inquired, edging\r\nup to him in a polite sort of way--at the same time keeping up the\r\nfree-and-easy. 'No,' he answered with a laconic air, and a half\r\nsignificant shrug of the shoulder, 'I'm merely strolling this way,\r\nleisurely contemplating. I take it you have not been long in the\r\nCapital?' he added. 'You are right on that point, citizen,' said I in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\"'Expecting a good appointment?' he continued to inquire,\r\nphilosophically. 'Well, it may be: s'pose you're in for a\r\nMinistership, if you come out a martyr,' I replied, adding a Western\r\nwink which is given with both eyes. He very good-naturedly\r\nacknowledged that I had hit the mark, gave me his arm, said we must\r\nlook in somewhere by the way-side and taste a small drop of Young\r\nAmerican whiskey, which would have the effect of making stronger our\r\nfriendship. This we did, drinking a good time to Mr. Pierce. No sooner\r\nwas the whiskey down than all his ideas came straight up. He said he\r\nwas none of yer small fry;--like thunder he had stumped it for General\r\nPierce; like electricity he had down in Georgia and Western Alabama\r\ncarried everything for true democracy. 'Reckon Mr. Smooth never was\r\ndown South?' he concluded, in parenthesis. I assured him I never was;\r\nbut that I had heard it was great of office-holders, and persons who\r\nwould, with every consideration for the Union in general, hold the\r\nfederal government very fast. To this he merely bowed in confirmation.\r\nTo another question, which was rather of a delicate nature, he said\r\nthe South did not so much value the emoluments of office; but her sons\r\nreverenced the noble qualities of their forefathers, with whom dignity\r\nwas inherent,--and it was they that were best qualified to maintain\r\nand spread its influence for the benefit of the nation. It was the\r\ndignity of the nation, made manifest in its government, the South\r\nsought to maintain. So said my friend, whose name was Pringle\r\nPierpont--well acquainted with Uncle Sam. All of a sudden he laughed\r\noutright, saying I was ignorant of the _why and how to do, diplomacy_\r\nof Washington. What it is impossible to get you must always say you\r\nnever wanted; and what is within your reach, always say was far beyond\r\nour expectations. Meantime, be a philosopher, and act with apparent\r\nindifference to what is going on around you: never tell a friend you\r\nare worth less than one hundred thousand dollars. Upon such an\r\nhypothesis you may face the General, talk profound (here and there in\r\nparenthesis letting out your knowledge of foreign affairs), but never\r\ngive him to understand that you can extract crooked and put straight\r\nideas into his head--above all, be sure and feel as independent as a\r\nwood-sawyer at two dollars a day. Play well your face, and a spoil of\r\nthe game just won will be yours. Marcy is father of this principle!\r\nHeed not the sympathy between your heart and head,--while the one\r\nfeels high never let the other play low. Accept anything the General\r\nmay be pleased to offer, adding that it is in respect to his great\r\ntalent and your anxiety to keep respectable his foreign affairs; and\r\nthink how you belie your conscience the while. Now, Smooth, you will\r\nsee how open-armed the General will be to see me!'\r\n\r\n\"I told Mr. Pierpont how glad I was to hear it, seeing that it might\r\nbe the means of putting me through on the same hook. Without\r\nhesitation, he said he would do what he could. Had I fought in the\r\nMexican war the case would have been different--had I been true to the\r\nSouth, the case had been very different: the distinctions here\r\nenumerated brought down the scale. 'However, the General and me are\r\none, having fought by his side in Mexico, and you shall be put\r\nthrough.' So saying, we proceeded on our way, reaching in a few\r\nminutes the White House, the gardens of which we found transplanted\r\nwith citizens--set here and there as thick as the gardener's tulips.\r\nBefore the circular carriage-way that sweeps to the great entrance,\r\nfiled a rampart of moody faces. Mr. Mulligan said they were there for\r\nthe study of Botany, he believed. Near the great portico stood the\r\ntall figure of a man plainly dressed in blackest broadcloth; he\r\nsauntered about as if contemplating some hopeless game of party.\r\nAnother looked as if he had just sprung from a dressing-case to\r\npresent himself before Grandpapa Marcy, in the hope of his personal\r\nappearance making stronger his claims to a very acceptable\r\nappointment. A third had a woe-begone smile on his face, and seemed\r\nstudying the nature of a plant that would soon need a careful hand.\r\nWhen accosted concerning his musings, he said he had done battle right\r\nmanfully for the democracy; and now Mr. Pierce's only reply was, that\r\nhis demands were of so hard a nature as to render it impossible for\r\nhim to knock under. I told him that I would take the small points of\r\nMr. Pierce's ideas, and the strong points of Mr. Marcy's, and from\r\nthem try to work out the P's and Q's of his case.\r\n\r\n\"'You don't know if the General is at home, do you?' I inquired of\r\nhim, with as much good intention as it were possible to put in a\r\nquestion. 'Know nothing about him since he's possessed himself of the\r\nWhite House!--My name is Major Sykes, of the Hard Shells, New York! I\r\nknow as little of him as the country did before he was elected:--now\r\nand then I see him smoking a long nine while laying off at his ease,\r\nhis dirty boots sticking out of the east window.' Here I interrupted by\r\nasking if it were possible such charges could be true. 'True!'\r\n(exclaimed he, more gritty than ever), 'true as daylight; the nation\r\nmay bless itself if he stops there. Be careful, my down-east friend,\r\nbe careful. He will sell you for a mess of corn for his black\r\npig. Down-east will stand no chance until Down-south gets\r\nsatisfactorily served: a wondrous change has come over the General\r\nsince he left the granite hills of his native State, where he did the\r\nlaw trade in a small way. Now--Smooth, I think they call you, says\r\nhe--if I be not much mistaken the General will create a Babylon of\r\nparties, the result of which will render it difficult to define his\r\nown position. If the General would but get up a _cross_ between\r\nsouthern secessionists and northern free-soilers, how happily it would\r\nillustrate his policy.' Clasping his hand, 'Major Sykes,' said I, 'I\r\npity you.'\r\n\r\n\"'And so do I you,' he replied quickly. 'And when you come face to\r\nface with the General, think of Uncle Sam, but don't forget\r\nyourself,--_that is the motto!_' Saying thus, he started off, much\r\nafter the fashion of a man who feels somewhat fudgy. Duly esteeming\r\nthe position of a man who has that in his composition which gives\r\npower to manliness, and has higher motives than political for its\r\naims, I made my way to the entrance of the White House, whistling\r\nYankee Doodle as I went. The closer I got to the great doors the more\r\nviolent became the crowd, until at last it ended in a jam of\r\nbodies. 'Not so fast!' exclaimed an anxious individual, whose eyes\r\ndarted terror from their very sockets. 'Gentlemen!--it's my turn,'\r\nre-echoes another half-stifled voice. 'Was not I in the city seven\r\nweeks before the inauguration? and didn't I carry everything for the\r\nGeneral down in Pennsylvania?' roars a tall individual, whose hat had\r\nreceived what may be called a shocking smash. Then they swayed forward\r\nin a serf of bodies. Now it poised, as if for breath; then again it\r\nswayed onward, threatening limb and wind. An exceedingly lean\r\ngentleman, with a hard brown face, and a patch over his left eye,\r\ncried out to the figure that stood bowing at the door, and demanded\r\nthat his card be first taken to the General, whom he was kind enough\r\nto declare a right good fellow and a most intimate friend of\r\nhis. 'Perhaps you have a claim that way!' retorts a sharp voice, which\r\nbelonged to a sturdy figure well out at the elbows. He declared he had\r\ndriven the whigs out of Old North Carolina--had carried strong the,\r\nState for Pierce and posterity. Another individual near by, and who\r\nseemed inclined to doubt the assertion, suggested whether it were not\r\nmore probable he carried all the _watering_ establishments of that\r\nrenowned state, seeing that his nose and eyes had stood the storm of\r\nspirits. No one ever heard of his carrying anything else! 'True,'\r\nrejoined another: 'he can drink his way through a democratic canvass,\r\ntell the most amiable lies, absorb any amount of chaffing, and stands\r\nless at swearing than any other man in the country: more than all, he\r\ncan demolish the King's English at a stroke.' Such pulling, hauling,\r\nsqueezing and yawning, 'cussin' and swearing--such cross-firing,\r\ncrooked joking, and slang jibes, never before was seen in such perfect\r\nmedley. In calmer moments, even the hard-fisted, iron-hearted,\r\nunterrified and never-washed democracy would have shed a few blushes\r\nover it. Old democracy was nowhere--Young America was triumphant; his\r\nsprouts were up and coming.\r\n\r\n\"'Clear the way there!' I exclaimed, raising my voice to a point.\r\n'Mr. Smooth will walk in, and himself present his card to the\r\nGeneral.' The crowd looked amazed,--begun to give way. 'Mr. Smooth,\r\ncitizens,' continued I, motioning as if it were my intention to\r\nspeechify, 'is something of a body--don't stand none of your small\r\nfritters. Mr. Smooth--like the principles of his party--was intended\r\nfor cutting a figure in the world; he will unmask aristocracy, whip\r\ncreation, and demonstrate the truth of manifest destiny.' Then they\r\nall shouted a fashionable hee-haw, by which they hoped to drive me off\r\nthe track; but it was no go. 'Clar the way,' says I, 'or I'll split\r\nthe crowd like a thousand of bricks!' I accompanied the word with a\r\nterrible look, at which they filed right and left as I chased square\r\nup to the inner door, where stood a stiff sort of person, whose\r\nclothes had grown on him--so tight were they. Surprised at my sudden\r\napproach, he first gave many nervous winks and blinks, and then added\r\nthe silly airs of my Lord Spoonbill's menial, who, with hair buttered\r\nand powdered, knew but the servilities of flunkeyism. 'Is the General\r\nat home?' I demanded, adding before he had time to answer, that if he\r\nhad a spare lucifer I'd have no objection to taking a smoke with\r\nhim. With the consequence of a sleepy congressman, he inquired if my\r\nbusiness with the General was special. He seemed to have the keeping\r\nof the General, much after the fashion of a keeper who guards the wild\r\nanimal of a menagerie.\r\n\r\n\"'You must send up your card: it's a question whether he is out of his\r\nmorning gown and slippers, however!' Here the man looked doubtingly at\r\nthe card, then gave his head a significant shake.\r\n\r\n\"'General ain't got so mighty big since he moved from New Hampshire?'\r\nI inquired, as the fellow hesitated and again viewed me from the\r\nextreme points. 'Now, Uncle Sam, to you I would say a word, hoping, in\r\nthe spirit of a very good christian, that it may be received as\r\nwholesome advice. You, Sam, are forgetting that fame which should\r\nreflect us in future ages; you, Sam, are assisting those who would lay\r\nsullied hands on our pure republicanism--who would sink it in the\r\npolitical slough, and build over it the reeking bastard of a pitiable\r\ntyranny. Stretch out thy hand, Sam, that we may cease to cut before\r\nthe world and the rest of mankind so sorry a figure. Sam! you have\r\nsent your little villains out upon the world; recall them ere they\r\nprove themselves great fools at our expense.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, to go back:--I began to push my way past the flunkey, when he\r\nsummoned his brass and said I couldn't come in--that I must slide\r\nmyself into costume of the eight stripe! This to me was neither\r\ndiplomatic nor polite. And being deemed impolite, according to the\r\nrules of our Young America, I placed the broad front of my\r\nknuckle-bones between his observators, (just to bring out his spunk),\r\nand demanded to know what they charged in Washington for a few\r\nknockings-down. To which he elongated himself, and with cool assurance\r\nsaid it had never before been his fortune to be put through the\r\nprocess--hence he was not prepared to figure up the amount. A place\r\ncalled limbo, he said, was just over at the corner; that I better keep\r\nan eye to it. This last saying gave the crowd outside furniture for a\r\ngood laugh; they, the citizens, set to quizzing me about the hang of\r\nmy breeches, which they were pleased to call diplomatic. This, I\r\ninferred, was in consequence of Grandpapa Marcy having gone to there\r\nwas no knowing how deep into the breeches business, hoping thereby to\r\nprevent plain American citizens making very unplain apes of themselves\r\nwhen abroad. Indeed, neighbor Marcy would demonstrate to the world\r\nthat cloth and diplomacy were two very different things. And this\r\ndoctrine my Uncle Buck--all praise to his name--fully endorsed,--that\r\nis, he proved himself the only American minister not given to\r\npurloined crests and crimson cloth.\r\n\r\n\"'Smooth is a nine-cornered citizen in the rough: he needs polishing\r\ndown with a federal holly-stone before he can be admitted into good\r\nsociety:' a voice like the creaking of a door resounded through the\r\npassage. Being a rough sort of citizen didn't affect me as long as I\r\nhad the straight up-and-down principles within. Well, I got up the\r\ngo-a-head, and walked in steady. 'T'wont do! citizen Smooth!'\r\ninterposes the flunkey, putting out his right hand as his face\r\nreddened into a blaze. 'Young America must keep within bounds; he must\r\nconform to the established etiquette before he can see the General.'\r\nNot liking to be out of sorts, I turned to him, and with the best kind\r\nof good nature told him not to come within grasping distance.\r\n\r\n\"Lord bless yer soul, Uncle Sam! I told him it was always good policy\r\nto keep civil to distinguished individuals, and treating his insolence\r\nas Captain Ingraham would an Austrian proclamation, I kept onward\r\n(that's the motto!) until the passage-way opened into a gorgeously\r\ndecorated hall, the motto on the door of which I surveyed until my\r\nhead begun to ache. The General seems to have got him a snug and\r\nwell-ordained establishment, thought I. But the fixings were rather\r\nmore profuse than democracy in its simplicity had led me to suppose\r\nits taste appreciated. But there was no concealing the fact, that the\r\ndemocracy--its love of simplicity not excepted--did pay large sums now\r\nand then for showy fixtures and grand failures. The short-comings of\r\nthe New Hampshire law-shop were extinct--elegance everywhere met the\r\neye. While enjoying my meditations one flunkey approached another,\r\ntelling him to keep a keen eye on that fellow--meaning me. Then a slim\r\nfigure done up in dignity and tight clothes approached me with a\r\npolite bow: 'Please remember this is the President's mansion,' said\r\nhe, viewing my perpendicular as if he questioned whether my length was\r\nall real growth. Seeing that the establishment belonged to Uncle Sam,\r\nI assured him he was a little too impertinent.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, neighbor!' says I to the citizen, don't deceive yourself by\r\nsupposing the General has got his aristocracy up like this before he\r\nhas lodged three months in the White House. I'm an independent\r\ncitizen; come to put some straight policy into the General, who, with\r\nthe assistance of his grind-stone man, Fourney, unfortunately has got\r\neverything into a twist. My name (sometimes they call me Squire) is\r\nSolomon Smooth. It don't matter what they call me now, for be it\r\nknown, ye men of titles, all the fishermen in our district have become\r\njudges and generals. This is the result of that necessity that makes\r\nnegro-drivers of the south captains and majors. 'But the President,'\r\nsaid he, 'has got such a fearful load of business on his hands this\r\nmorning, it will be impossible he can see Mr. Smooth, nor are the\r\napartments in a state to be seen by visitor--' 'Always in the suds!' I\r\ninterrupted. 'No! that ain't it,' he continued, half trembling of\r\nfear; 'but the President is new, nor yet has got into the straight way\r\nof doing crooked business.'\r\n\r\n\"'Never mind that,' replied I, 'Smooth's an independent citizen, who\r\nmust not be interfered with while taking a turn round the\r\nestablishment: he neither stands on ceremony nor political\r\npoint-making.' The fact was, Mr. Smooth had a very wholesome hatred of\r\nthe nonsense of ceremony, and always pitied that complacency of Uncle\r\nJohn Bull who, like a well-worn and faithful pack-horse, never\r\nflinched under the heavy burden of that precious legacy called royal\r\nblood, which, said blood, was fast absorbing the vital blood of the\r\nnation. May our Union always be spared the degradation of such blood!\r\n\r\n\"The fellow, seeing I was not to be outdone, gave it up for a bad job,\r\nand contented himself with following me here and there, keeping a\r\nfixed eye on my motions, as if he feared I was going to become\r\nenamoured of some of Mr. Pierce's chambermaids, which said commodity\r\nwas acknowledged to be very pretty, and much admired by Jones, who did\r\nthe fashionable at Willard's. It having been said that the General,\r\nlike Jackson, would keep himself, I endeavored to persuade the fellow\r\nto show me his nook. He only shook his head and said it wouldn't do:\r\nso I took a careless stroll through the loose apartments, and ceased\r\nonly when my sight was gratified. 'Well!' says the flunkey, adding a\r\ndeep sigh and a despairing shake of the head, 'it's no use trying to\r\ncontrol this citizen; he's of the fast school, without bowels.'\r\n\r\n\"'You may believe it!' returned I, advancing toward a broad circular\r\nstairway that wound downward far into the regions below, where I\r\nexpected to find Fourney and Company holding the General down upon the\r\ngrindstone, while Uncles Caleb and Jeff turned, and Marcy stood by to\r\nsay when enough of the rough was got off. 'There! in my soul he's\r\ngoing down into the kitchen!' The fellow bawled out as I passed down,\r\nand soon disappeared, saying it was just the winding way I sought;\r\nand, though the things to be seen in the vortex to which it led might\r\nbe dangerously dear to the nation, the proof would at least be\r\nconvincing. On I went, the way darkening as I advanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMR. SMOOTH PENETRATES THE DARK CONFINES OF MR. PIERCE'S KITCHEN, WHERE\r\nHE FINDS THINGS SADLY CONFUSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Down, down, down, went, groping my way (significant of the General's\r\npolicy) through a long dark passage, whence came a rancorous stench,\r\nstrong enough to kill cats and doubtful democrats. 'Keep the right\r\nhand way for the kitchen: General is in there, assisting in the making\r\nof a monster stew. Work your course through the smoke--you may be sure\r\nMr. Pierce is in the thickest cloud, though over the smallest\r\nstew-pan,' a voice echoed, as if broken on the winds. 'All right!' I\r\nmuttered, confronting on my way the still stronger odour of the\r\nsickening steam. My intention was to have a political discussion with\r\nthe cook (Fourney by name) and say a thing or two to the General; for\r\nI had got a sort of cross-grained notion into my head that he was\r\ncompounding a grand stew for the black pig with the horns. Meanwhile\r\nmy stomach said it would have no objection to join the General over a\r\ngood breakfast. Presently I scented the frying of fish, which betold\r\nthat I was on the right track. But lo! as I was about to open a great\r\ndoor that led into where the fussing and frying was going on, a voice\r\nscreamed out--'Visitors are forbidden these premises!' Here was a\r\npretty kettle of political fish. 'Much you know about it!' I replied\r\ntestily, and turning saw nothing but fog and confusion. Faith and\r\nenergy being the two great pillars of human progress, I summoned them\r\nto my aid, and pressed onward, determined to see for myself who\r\nregulated the culinary. This resolution was adopted solely on the\r\nground that the General had repudiated his responsibility to the\r\npeople, and joined hands with those who eat up all the loaves and\r\nlittle fishes.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Smooth, on behalf of Young America, esteemed the having positive\r\nproof of how Mr. General Pierce kept his kitchen things a duty he\r\ncould not forego, and upon the strength of which he presented himself\r\nto the august culinary cabinet, which he found enveloped in a dense\r\ncloud. As I passed the great door, a fat man from Florida, who filled\r\nthat office of steady habits, the doorkeeper, said Mr. Smooth, which\r\nhe read on my card, was decidedly impertinent; the more so because\r\nneither of the old grey-back parties had ever troubled themselves\r\nabout the kitchen fixings; that the present was an innovation he was\r\nsure Mr. Pierce would resent by the withholding of appointments. I\r\nleft him to his opinion, and delved my way through the smoke, until I\r\nbegan to think I had lost myself, and instead of Mr. Pierce on the\r\ngrindstone found a lower region of unlimited extent--so murky and\r\ndismal was the place. They said it didn't use to be so! Such fritter\r\nfrying; such johnny-cake baking; such chowder making, and flounder\r\nfrying! Nearly a dozen fine buxom-looking, corn-fed females\r\n(_helps_),--such as Vermont only can grow, were stuffing and stewing,\r\nand beating and battering, and themselves seeming on the eve of\r\ndissolution. They evinced alarm at my presence, but I told them not to\r\nbe scared, inasmuch as I was an intimate acquaintance of the General,\r\nfor whom I carried Cape Cod. On the left side of the kitchen there\r\nstood at a great deal table an aged maid whose mien was somewhat\r\nfidgety. This visible nervousness was increased with the labour\r\nnecessary to prepare the ponderous pile of soft dough-nuts she worked\r\nupon; which, she said, when ready (though of little substance) were\r\nintended to satisfy the Down-easters, who never expected much, and\r\nseldom got anything. I pitied the poor old lady, for she seemed well\r\nworn. She declared it was pinching times in the kitchen--that is, her\r\npart of it. She prepared a deal of little niceties for the\r\npeace-loving North: but, the General was so pinching with matters on\r\nthat side of the house, and had become so enamoured of the black pig!\r\nThis voracious brute demanded everything, and got what he\r\ndemanded--even got us into a deal of trouble. Indeed, it had been said\r\nthat all the swill in the country wouldn't satisfy him--he would seek\r\nabroad for more. 'Needn't be afraid, old lady,' said I, edging up to\r\nher in a polite sort of way: 'Smooth won't harm nobody. The New\r\nEnglanders think well of the women--they do!' Here I gave the old lady\r\nmy hand, and shook her's right heartily. 'Why,' I continued, 'there's\r\nthree Women's Rights Societies down Massachusetts way, any one of\r\nwhich can start a breeze at pleasure--blow the men all into thunder! I\r\nsay, old lady, better join one of them--pay fifty cents, and blow the\r\nmen all into political rags. Musn't take what I say amiss; but you\r\nlooks as if you could do some blowing: the General standing much in\r\nneed of that article, why not volunteer? The General is going it\r\npretty fast now, but just get the Women's Rights Societies to blow him\r\na little, and he'll go fast enough for any Young American party out.'\r\nAfter leaving the old woman, who said she was nearly related to\r\nGeneral Cass, I went politely to the other girls, bidding them, one\r\nafter another, a square down good-morning, ending with a social chat\r\nand a smile for them all. On the opposite side of the smoky kitchen\r\nstood the grim figure of a nigger wench, as big as the north side of a\r\nDutch lighthouse, and as saucy as Benton's goat. The way she was\r\nmaking the wool fly over a sas-pan as big as old Zack Coffin's ile\r\nkettle was a caution to nervous folks. 'What on earth have ye got in\r\nthat, eh?' I inquires, peeping over the side into the half-scalding\r\nfoam.\r\n\r\n\"'What business is that to you?' sounds, like thunder rolling away in\r\nthe distance, from t'other side the cauldron. Looking up almost\r\ndumb-founded I espied the hard phiz of the General, in dim outline\r\nthrough the fog and steam, stirring away at a massive ladle.\r\n\r\n\"'Pierce! Lord love yer soul--is it you?' says I, my feelings rising\r\ninto a rhapsody of affection for him: 'Give us yer hand.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, it's me; just come round here if you can see your way through,'\r\nsays he; and I fumbled my way round, and got him by the hand, and had\r\na hearty good shake, just for old acquaintance sake.\r\n\r\n\"'But what in the name of Columbus are you doing here?' I inquired,\r\ntouching him on the elbow, significantly.\r\n\r\n\"'Well!' he answers, rather undecidedly, 'just helping prepare this\r\npot of mixture for the black pig.' He kept on moving his big ladle\r\nwith one hand and throwing in additional feed with the other, from a\r\nbucket that stood close by.\r\n\r\n\"I inquired of the General where he kept so dangerous an animal, and\r\nwas told in the most complacent manner that he ran all about, was as\r\nravenous of power as the gentleman of those lower regions we hear so\r\nmuch about is of sinners; that he demanded all the country's swill.\r\nHere the General threw into the cauldron another sprinkling of grits,\r\nwhich he said was to complete the pot of homony. It was merely the\r\ndaily feed of the black pig, which the colored female assisted the\r\nGeneral in preparing. The General seemed very good-natured, and\r\ncommenced a mathematical description of the ingredients of the\r\nmixture, when suddenly there came a fierce blow from behind, which\r\nwell nigh tilted him deep into the foaming liquid. I grabbed the broad\r\nexpanse of his nether garments, while the wench screamed, and was only\r\nquieted when she found him safe under her broad lee. A deep sonorous\r\nvoice responded:--'Stir quicker in the feed!' I turned to see from\r\nwhence it came, and who had dealt thus unmercifully with the General,\r\nwhen behold! there stood this hideous animal. With fourteen horns he\r\nincessantly used, and two just growing, he hoped in time to use; with\r\na back of thorns he ever and anon threatened all who came near him;\r\nwith a tail of poison he defiantly lashed, and a wicked eye that\r\nsought objects afar off--he was the most pertinacious brute unchained.\r\nMoreover he had a snout like a ploughshare, with which he had\r\nfrequently driven Mr. Pierce to the wall.\r\n\r\n\"'Add more grits!' again the brute growled out, as if alike unhappy\r\nwith himself and those around him. The voice had scarcely delivered\r\nits command, when Mr. General Pierce, as undecided as wanting in vigor\r\nof intellect, turned gently round, patted the hideous monster on the\r\nhead--said he would do all he could to pacify him, though to appease\r\nhis discontent seemed impossible. Indeed, it was a fact that\r\nnotwithstanding much of the swill intended for the whiter portion of\r\nthe litter was sacrificed to this demanding brute, he illustrated his\r\ngratitude by threatening to swallow Mr. Pierce into the bargain. This\r\nwas most unfortunate, seeing how much had been done to transplant the\r\nbreed to foreign lands.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Smooth felt that for a President to be thus driven to extremes\r\nwas indeed an unenviable position. I told him I thought Young America\r\nwould do something, and, with a little advice concerning his\r\nprinciples, passed on through the smoke and foam until I confronted\r\nUncle Jeff and Cousin Guth, both hard at work over a blazing fire,\r\nfrying a monster fish. Uncle Jeff's apron looked as if he did most of\r\nthe greasy work, while Guth looked on and directed the turns--now and\r\nthen whispering a word to the French cook, who with sparkling eye, and\r\noval olive face, and hair so glossy, black, and curly, was dexterously\r\ncompounding a luscious sauce. 'Going it on the strong!' said I, giving\r\nUncle Jeff a significant wedge under the shorts as he was about to let\r\nthe grease in the stew-pan fuzzle. Guth, who at the moment commenced\r\ndredging in a little more pepper, and a little more butter, and a\r\nsmall sprinkling of salt, said they had been trying to cook this old\r\nfish for there was no knowing how many years, all to no purpose; but\r\nnow that the arts of the very best French cook in the country had been\r\nsecured he was sure to be done brown. Here he smiled and turned to the\r\ncook in question, who bowed with such grace! Such a bow in the\r\npresence of ladies would have secured his reputation. Indeed, the said\r\ncook was extremely neat of person, though rather below the middle\r\nstature, and was well thought of among lawyers and ladies, who\r\ndeclared they liked his graces better than his gravies. 'He's of the\r\nright stripe--a fillibuster cook!' said Jeff, exultingly, as Guth gave\r\nthe coals another stir. 'This is a Cuba flounder,' interposed\r\nGuth. 'You see, Mr. Smooth, the General is exceedingly partial to this\r\nsort of flounder, but he doesn't understand the quality of dressing\r\nrequisite to the cooking it--he must be done with native sauce. It is\r\nnecessary he should be fried in a southern griddle, with plenty of\r\nnative sauce--an article for which this cook of ours is not\r\ncelebrated.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, gents!' rejoined I, 'if you do brown that old fellow this\r\nseason I'll knock under. However, don't be bashful about extending\r\nSmooth an invitation to breakfast: understand, he is rather fond of a\r\ngood fish hash, which he thinks it is the profession of your French\r\ncook to do up.'\r\n\r\n\"'Lord bless you!' quickly interrupted Uncle Jeff, 'being a good\r\nDown-east democrat, your wish shall be gratified.' Then in great good\r\nnature he told me just to step along, and a little further into the\r\ndark smoke I'd find Grandpapa Marcy and Uncle Dib, exerting their\r\nwondrous energies over a stew they were puzzled to get to the right\r\nsubstance. Knowing that their good advice was much better as example\r\nthan the result of their actions, I wended my way along, leaving Guth\r\nand Jeff to their frying, and soon came upon the two old worthies,\r\nbusily employed over stews of the most incomprehensible ingredients.\r\n'That,' spoke Grandpapa Marcy, as I approached within hearing\r\ndistance, 'is the real democratic stew, it will cement hard shells and\r\nsoft shells into one strong conglomerate mass.' He pointed to a\r\npunch-bowl held between their legs--(for they were seated on the\r\nfloor)--and containing a mixture they stirred with spoons containing\r\nthe Tammany-hall mark. For some time I stood contemplating the\r\nvenerable appearance of these two, nor could I resist a smile at the\r\nsingular occupation they had so readily adopted. Uncle Dib seemed\r\nhappy, and evidently had a keen sense of what the consistency of the\r\nstew must be to make the flounder palatable. Grandpapa's countenance,\r\nnevertheless, wore an air of deep anxiety. He had undertaken the\r\nmanagement of the most unruly set of cooks that ever infested the\r\nkitchen of a respectable gentleman; and they had made a shocking mess.\r\nAnd, too, Grandpapa, was unhappy; his clothes bore seedy marks, and\r\nhis breeches were in such a plight--it really excited our pity. I\r\ncalled his attention to an unmentionable rent in a conspicuous place,\r\nbut he seemed careless about it--said it was of no consequence--and\r\nthat Uncle Sam was a good old soul, and always paid the tailor--he\r\nknew from experience. Suddenly I heard the formidable negro-wench\r\nraising her voice in admonition. She was scolding the General, who\r\nstill kept stirring in the homony grits for the black pig. Then a\r\nnoise came through the foam and smoke as of one in trouble. 'Faster,\r\nfaster!' it spoke, 'stir in more grits!' Then followed a loud splash\r\nand a deathlike shriek; alarm and consternation spread throughout the\r\nbuilding. From the cauldron came the cry. Grandpapa moved for a\r\nmoment, as was his custom, declared the voice to be no other than that\r\nof the General himself. Dib agreed ('There's trouble!' he exclaimed)\r\nand both sprang to their feet, and with anxious countenances hastened\r\nto the rescue, Marcy crying out, as he passed Jeff and Guth, 'Stick by\r\nthe flounder, boys! Stand firm; don't give in until he's well cooked;\r\nwe'll save the General--you dig in the basting.' The boys, as\r\nGrandpapa called them, were crowding the charcoal finely. Always\r\nhaving a taste for seeing what was going on, I kept close at Dib's\r\nheels, and soon saw through the grim smoke where the trouble was. The\r\nblack pig had got the General poised by the nether part of his\r\nbreeches, on his Virginia horn, and was having a nice little game of\r\nshuttle-cock with him, just for his own amusement, while his executive\r\nvictim shrieked most piteously, expecting every succeeding surge would\r\nland him beneath the surface of the boiling mass. The old nigger wench\r\nhad fainted at the sight, and lay sprawled on the floor, as Marcy,\r\nmaking a grab at Mr. Pierce's breeches at a moment when the savage\r\nbrute was giving a last vault ere he landed his victim into the\r\nscalding homony, tripped his toe and brought his length upon the floor\r\nbeneath the pig's hind legs. 'It's all gone!' exclaimed the General;\r\nand in another minute nothing was seen save the soles of his boots\r\nprotruding above the boil-surface. The surly brute, having generously\r\nmoistened Grandpapa Marcy's head, stood, his fore-feet on the rim of\r\nthe cauldron, gazed after his struggling victim, and held his head\r\nhigh aloft in triumph. This brought Uncle Dib to the rescue. After\r\nraising Grandpapa, with limbs extended, they drew forth the\r\nhalf-cooked body, reeking with the black pig's swill, and laid it on\r\nthe kitchen floor, the ungrateful quadruped walking victoriously\r\naway. Satisfied that I had seen enough for one day, I sought my way\r\nback to the National, where I contemplated the next move necessary to\r\nmy mission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nMR. SOLOMON SMOOTH TAKES A FISH BREAKFAST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, Uncle Sam, I reckoned I'd seen enough of the kitchen\r\narrangements; so I left them scraping the General--that is, getting\r\noff the injured outside, in order to see what really he was made of,\r\nand what he had beneath the undefinable cover. When in Washington,\r\nthere's nothing like going ahead; and if you can look a man into\r\nrespect for you, so much the better. Dignitary or no dignitary won't\r\ndo; you must always profess to be a distinguished individual. Well, on\r\nthe strength of the invitation extended by Jeff--to take a fish\r\nbreakfast on the following morning, when it was expected the flounder\r\nwould be done brown, I again repaired to the White House, and after\r\npushing my way through all kinds of passages and doorways, found\r\nmyself in a gorgeous sort of establishment.\r\n\r\n\"'Your lookin for somethin, I take it?' said a trim figure, whose face\r\nrather bordered on the brassy.\r\n\r\n\"'Well! I reckon I am. Can you tell a stray citizen where the General\r\nhangs out in the morning?' I replied, as he confronted me and paused.\r\n\r\n\"'Sartin!' he rejoined, interrupting me, and at the same time looking\r\nvery sociable, as if he wanted to have a talk on politics.\r\nNevertheless, it was getting close upon the hour of breakfast; so he\r\ntakes me by the arm, and stepping through a frickazeed passage up to a\r\nlarge door which opened into a ponderously furnished room, 'I'll take\r\nyour card, sir!' continued he, with a low bow and a motion of the hand\r\nto sit down.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't have a card at hand, but chalked down Mr. Solomon Smooth, from\r\nCape Cod, on a piece of thick paper per, that suited all the purposes.\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Smooth belongs to the Young American party, if I mistake not?'\r\nhe returned, with a polite bow.\r\n\r\n\"'You better believe that, citizen!' says I, and off he goes, soon\r\ndisappearing through a door at the other end of the room. While he was\r\ngone, I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to take a survey of the\r\npremises. So, lighting my cigar, I began at the top end first. Such\r\nlooking-glasses, sofas, carpets--so much fashion and flummery, that\r\nnobody could tell what utility it contained, I never had seen\r\nbefore. Tell you what it is, Uncle Sam, we have an expensively queer\r\nway of representing our republican simplicity! As I was squinting\r\nabout, in comes the General, looking as bright as a newly-coined\r\ncent. Running up to me, with hand extended, and exulting with joy, he\r\nspake: 'Great kingdom, Smooth!--is it you?' And then he shaked my hand\r\nas if he never would let it go.\r\n\r\n\"''Tis me too!' says I, giving him a significant touch on the\r\nelbow. 'Didn't expect to see you looking so bright, General--rather a\r\nbad kettle of fish that you unfortunately got into yesterday, eh?'--\r\n\r\n\"'Oh no--things like those are mere trifles; hardly worth mentioning\r\namidst the current turmoil of the day. That black pig is an ungrateful\r\nbrute, though, I must confess in confidence,' the General replied,\r\ntouching me on the arm.\r\n\r\n\"'He sunk you in the very swill you were cooking for him,\r\neh?--petulant brute!' I rejoined.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Smooth,' said he, 'don't let us say any more about that; I was\r\ndeceived--most egregiously! How are all the Young Americans down your\r\nway--the real go-ahead stripe?' he inquired anxiously: and we both\r\nlaughed heartily to see one another. 'They're all bright ends up,\r\nGeneral,' said I. 'General!' (I touched him on the shoulder) ''taint\r\nmore nor three years since we used to go fishing in old Sam Peabody's\r\npond; hain't forgot it, I reckon?'\r\n\r\n\"'Not I, Smooth. Give us yer hand for old acquaintance sake! No change\r\nof power or circumstances could make me forget old associations.\r\nFortune may change, my feelings never; they have been and shall always\r\nbe with the people.' The General couldn't keep the dignity on, to save\r\nhis life; he was not born to do so!\r\n\r\n\"'Give us yer hand, General,' I demanded in reply; 'right glad to see\r\nyou, and to know that old New Hampshire's granite hills have not faded\r\nfrom your memory, nor been absorbed in the quantity of swill it seems\r\nnecessary to provide for the black-pig. But, I say, Frank, what\r\nharlequin-like changes politics take in a republic--now and then! Two\r\nyears ago, and who'd a' thought a' seeing you here? 'Stonished you\r\nyourself, didn't it? Scarcely expected to brush old General Scott's\r\nfuss and feathers into a cock'd up hat, eh? There's nothing like a\r\nman keeping his mouth shut when he's got others to do the fighting for\r\nhim; you know that, don't you, General?'\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Smooth is always asking some strange questions, or making some\r\nqueer observation!'\r\n\r\n\"'Now, General, I reckon how you didn't get the hang of this 'ere\r\nestablishment all on a sudden? Seems to me how I'd like to be\r\nPresident of these United States about two months, merely to have the\r\nsatisfaction of straightening the cross-grain of political parties;\r\nthey have got so so crooked now-a-days.' The President just then said\r\nhe would take my hat, and hoped I make myself quite at home. As\r\neverything seemed so comfortable, I had not the slightest objection.\r\n'Now, Smooth,' he reiterated, spreading his length on a magnificent\r\nsofa, 'I am anxious to hear how the Young American party progresses\r\ndown your way; and you must tell me all about it. I intend to give you\r\na roving commission as my minister in general.'\r\n\r\n\"'I'll do that,' I replied, and just when I was getting the story\r\nfixed square, he interrupted me by saying--'One moment, Mr. Smooth; we\r\nare going to have a flounder breakfast--it's the same old fellow you\r\nsaw Uncle Jeff and Guth cooking yesterday morning,--they've got him\r\npretty well browned--You must join us.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well,--have no objection; but tell us, General, how is the missus?'\r\n\r\n\"'Right well, Smooth; she'll be delighted to see you.'\r\n\r\n\"'And so will I to see the missus; I know'd her when she warn't\r\nbigger nor Cousin Obadiah's Jane, and didn't think no more about being\r\nMrs. President of these United States nor my missus.' In answer to\r\nwhich, the General said a respectable man might as well be President\r\nas anything else--we all know how to be. Here we joined arms, and like\r\njolly fellows of a stripe, took a few turns up and down the\r\napartment. 'Well! here's pure democracy,' thought I to myself. Taking\r\nMr. President Pierce's arm doubled my independence--made me feel that\r\nI was the left wing of his brightest hope. Having talked over a few\r\nsmall matters of foreign policy, we sauntered together into one of the\r\nlargest, and longest, and handsomest breakfast rooms this side of\r\nTexas. A table of great length stretched across its centre, upon which\r\nwas arranged in profusion, Georgia potatoes, New Hampshire bacon,\r\nVirginia oysters and fried eels, South Carolina rice cakes, and Cape\r\nCod fish balls--all strong incentives to the stomach of a hungry\r\npolitician. Trim waiters stood round, like statues tailored and\r\nanxiously waiting a guest's nod. As I cast a bird's eye glance down\r\nthe scene, in popped the General's missus, all calm, and with an air\r\nof motherly gentleness that inspired me with lofty reflections on\r\nwoman's mission. As she approached with her hand extended, and such a\r\nsweet smile on her face, I could not resist a salutation thus earnest,\r\nand grasping it, gave it a good, warm-hearted shake. She said great\r\nwas her joy at seeing Mr. Smooth--plain Solomon Smooth. She could not\r\nfeel more joy were I an Emperor--no not even were I a governor of\r\nHungary, who, having lost the chance of winning a diadem, would Uncle\r\nSam lent him aid to regain it. In another minute the gong sounded, the\r\ngreat doors at the opposite end of the hall opened, a train of\r\nserious-faced gentry entered, and as unceremoniously took seats. Mr.\r\nSmooth being put down number one, took a seat beside the missus. After\r\na blessing had been dispensed, the conversation turned on politics and\r\npotatoes. A potent-looking individual, who sat not far down the table,\r\nsaid the Union was known by its magistracy, which being an established\r\nfact, should make it incumbent that no chief of this great and growing\r\nnation leave the federal chair unmarked by some bold stroke. 'Good!'\r\nsays I, 'Smooth always went in for bold strokes--they are just the\r\nthings to make outsiders knock under--' Here I was just getting up to\r\nmake a speech on behalf of manifest destiny, when a gent who ought to\r\nhave been voted into the army as a regular cried out:--'Keep cool!\r\nkeep cool! Mr. Smooth.'\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely had he ceased speaking, when Uncle Caleb Grandpapa Marcy,\r\nCousin Guth, and good-natured Uncle Dib, and the grindstone-man,\r\nFourney,--all dressed in bright aprons, and white ghost-like\r\nnight-caps--made their appearance, tugging and puffing at a hand-bier,\r\non which lay the much-talked-of flounder. Jeff, who walked in front\r\nwith a drawn sword, wheezed, and Grandpapa grunted, and Dib said,\r\n'Carry a steady hand, boys!' and Guth said he would bear up his part,\r\nwhich was the tail part. Staggering along under the load, they brought\r\nforth in solemn procession the flounder, and after a good deal of bad\r\ndiplomacy, laid him, like a stuffed whale, on the table. The General\r\nwas not quite certain about the catch of this flounder; but as there\r\nwas nothing like having a dash at things now-a-days,--'here's go into\r\nit!' he exclaimed. 'I don't believe that fish is cooked enough,'\r\nretorted John Littlejohn, a statesman of very elastic capacity, who\r\nspoke for Uncle Bull, on t'other side of the big pond.\r\n\r\n\"Looking as if he were about making a longe into him, hit or miss, the\r\nGeneral seizes up the big carving-knife (generally used by Grandpapa\r\nMarcy) and asks who will have the first bit? The pall-bearers, still\r\nretaining their bright aprons and white caps, had taken seats at the\r\ntable, among the guests. 'It's all for me!' mumbles a sullen voice; no\r\none knew from whence it came. 'It's all for me!--who are you?'\r\nreiterated Mr. Pierce, kicking under the table: 'I believe in my soul\r\nit's the black pig, who always pursues unto the death what he\r\nconsiders his!' True enough, there the savage brute was, lashing\r\neverybody's legs, and threatening destruction with his wicked\r\nmouth. No one knew how he got into the dining-room; but where the good\r\nUncle Sam had anything to eat or give, there he was sure to be,\r\ndemanding more than his share. After a hard tussle, Grandpapa and\r\nUncle Caleb succeeded in driving him out of the room; albeit, it was\r\nonly for a time. The unsatisfied animal was always keeping Uncle Sam\r\nin a fuss, and the folks about the White House in an uproar. 'That\r\ncritter is always crying 'Me first!' rejoined Uncle Caleb, who, having\r\nlost his white cap in the tussle with the black pig, looked funny\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n\"'A Cuba flounder!' exclaims the General, who continued to work\r\ndiligently, his face flushed as crimson, but I as yet he had failed to\r\nsecure the first slice. It was evident he had made a stroke too bold,\r\nand would now be compelled to draw back a little--perhaps to take a\r\nfew more lessons in the diplomacy of carving. And while the General\r\nwas trying to get the knife into the neck part, the critter opened its\r\nmouth, and gasping looked as if it thought some of swallowing a whole\r\ncabinet of philibusteroes.\r\n\r\n\"'The brute ain't cooked yet--if it don't open its mouth!' proclaimed\r\nthe General, the hair almost standing on his head, as he reclined back\r\nin fright.\r\n\r\n\"'The critter's going to be generous, I do believe!' chimed in\r\nGrandpapa, whose white cap, during the moment of excitement, had\r\nfallen over into Mrs. Dobbin's plate; from whence that good-natured\r\nlady, in the moment of anxiety, removed it to her lap, and ere she had\r\nbeen served found it near her pretty lips, under the mistaken\r\nimpression of its being a napkin. Grandpapa, discovering his loss,\r\npolitely developed the dear lady's mistake.\r\n\r\n\"'Tell you what it is General; you'll have to be mighty careful, or\r\nthat Cuba flounder will swallow all the shiners in Uncle Sam's brass\r\nbox without yielding anything in exchange,' I insinuated.\r\n\r\n\"'Not a bit on't!' says Uncle Jeff, going off into a state of\r\nexcitement: 'Just lend me the carver; I'll put him through;' and\r\nseizing the knife from Mr. Pierce's hand, and the steel from\r\nGrandpapa's, he was just on the point of making a thrust into the\r\nfish, when his mouth again expanded, his fins fluttered, and out came\r\na long roll of paper. 'What on earth is that?' inquired the astonished\r\nGeneral, as Jeff unconsciously let the knife fall in fright, and\r\nGrandpapa gave an anxious look toward the door, as if to measure the\r\ndistance between it and his chair,--while John Littlejohn applying his\r\nglass to his eyes, squinted seriously at it. 'He's not just done\r\nenough for you yet, gentlemen; I think you had better let him stand\r\nawhile,' remarks our Cousin John, rather coolly. 'You cannot\r\nrepublicanize him, unless you change his head and heart; I can tell\r\nyou that, my good fellows.'\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jeff, at Grandpapa's bidding, took up the roll of paper, the\r\ntext of which Mr. Pierce requested him to read. 'A protest, your\r\nExcellency!' said Jeff, the paper vibrating in his nervous hand. 'It\r\nsays, this is to notify Brother Jonathan, that the extreme largeness\r\nof his appetite, insatiate in its demands for my body, shall never be\r\ngratified therewith. You are far-seeing, have grown powerful, and are\r\nrather a good sort of fellow, Jonathan; but I'm not quite ready to say\r\nI should prefer either to belong to your household or provide your\r\ntable with dainty dishes. The fact is, Jonathan, and you know it, when\r\ndisposed to think on the square, we are not prepared to denounce our\r\nleague loyalty and come over to you; common sense might have convinced\r\nyou of this fact. The world protests against your forcing propensities\r\nin this little affair between us. For more than two centuries have I\r\nremained at peace; let me so continue. I admit that kings, queens, and\r\ncourtiers, have feasted on my fatlings, and even discomfited me, and\r\ncaused much discontent among my people; but even they would rather\r\nbear the ills that be than fall victims to your black pig's will.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well!' interrupted Uncle Jeff, looking suspiciously about the table,\r\n'if he ain't the toughest old flounder I ever did see!'\r\n\r\n\"'Shouldn't be surprised if you found it so!' replied the fish, his\r\nspacious jaws opening, and the end of another parchment slowly\r\nprotruding from his mouth. 'Read that! I must get somebody to help me\r\nto eject this instrument.' The General wrested it from its mouth,\r\nturned it over and over, and tried and retried to read it. 'It's a\r\nprotest from John, my Uncle, John Bull and Johnny Crappo, which\r\nsays:--'We, the said John and Louis, having entered into a sublime\r\nalliance with our sublime brother of the East, by which one great and\r\nmighty power has been concentrated, do humbly beg Mr. President Pierce\r\n(for whom we now have and ever hope to entertain the very highest\r\nesteem) that he take heed how he dips his fingers into other people's\r\npolitical pies. And, further, while exhibiting so earnest a desire to\r\nappropriate the choicest delicacies of his neighbors to the cravings\r\nof his black pig, to be a little more modest. Now, we, the undersigned\r\nLouis and John, whose names--in alliance have become mightiest among\r\nthe mighty, are duly convinced of the many inconsistencies,\r\nirregularities, and breaches of _good_ faith, together with the many\r\npetty acts of tyranny, the mother of this Antilla flounder has been\r\nguilty of, to her own disgrace. But greatness should be known by its\r\nforbearance with the weak; hence we should bear and forgive. Yea, we\r\nadmit that her footprints are marked with blood--that her history has\r\nnumberless pages written in blood--that her arrogance and avarice have\r\nblotted out her national virtue, and now work like a battering-ram her\r\ndownfall. Yet, as arrogance is but another name for weakness, is it\r\nnot better to brush off than kill the wasp? The principle herein\r\ncontained we have, in the sublimity of our power, adopted as an\r\nexample to the nations of the earth. Jonathan! we like your\r\namiability; we esteem you as a keen fellow, who, large of trade, and\r\nwise in the ways of a cheap government, may well boast a happy people:\r\nbridle, then, the audacity of that southern ambition, lest it betray\r\nyou into unforseen difficulties. Let peace be the guardian of that\r\ncommerce now teeming its grandeur and wealth on your shores; and in\r\nall kindness, Mr. Pierce, do we speak, when we say,--look to those\r\n_things_ you send into foreign lands to represent the quiet grandeur\r\nof our institutions: send the gentleman whose conduct may be a means\r\nto great ends, for ruffians leave their little stains behind.''\r\n\r\n\"'Well!' exclaimed the General, his large square face reddening with\r\nanxiety, as he turned to Uncle Dib and Grandpapa, 'I should call this\r\nthe insolence of sublime power. Let them try their sublime power on\r\nthis side of the Atlantic!' Here the General gave his head a\r\nsignificant toss, and wiped his lips as he added,--'_Young America_\r\ncan whip the three.' This pithy speech being received with great\r\napplause, he reached over his hand, and was about taking mine, when I\r\nwarmly embraced his, saying--'Give me you yet, General! Messrs. John,\r\nLouis & Co., having consolidated their sublime power, must not\r\nentertain the idea of making a menace over here. We have no means of\r\nquestioning the legitimate qualities of this sublime joint-stock\r\ncompany; but we would advise its keeping decidedly cool about matters\r\nthis side of the big water, lest its stock get to a very low-water\r\nmark. This old flounder, nevertheless, is a hard case for cooks, nor\r\nin my opinion will he be made softer by that celebrated French cook of\r\nyours, whose process is that of too suddenly piling on the charcoal.\r\nIn fact, I believe it not untrue that in political cooking a Frenchman\r\nis more a man of muss than method. This you, General, might have known\r\nbefore you engaged him to cater for Spanish appetites. In truth, (it\r\nmust be told now and then, General), that black pig you so fondly\r\nnurse, and which you can neither tame nor make grateful, is\r\nsacrificing us to his poisonous litter. And, too, he is dividing his\r\nown pen; and when pigs become divided among themselves, refuse to eat\r\nout of one trough, and threaten to devour each other, they are sure to\r\nbecome an easy prey to the bore of fractional sovereignity.' With the\r\nexception of the General, all listened attentively while I spoke: he,\r\nexhibiting little concern, arose with the calmness of moonlight, and\r\nwas about to make some remarks, as the flounder again opened wide his\r\nmouth, which produced a pause. 'You are right,' joined in the\r\nflounder; 'that black pig's love of territorial feasts knows no\r\nbounds, nor will he stop at that point where justice sets the limit;\r\nhe will continue his insatiate trade until common sense and generous\r\nsentiment interpose and exterminate him. Here is another paper for\r\nyou--read it! It is the protest of the people of free, enlightened,\r\nand happy New England: they protest against being swallowed up in your\r\nblack pig's bowels!' Again the flounder mechanically closed its mouth.\r\n\r\n\"'And my old governor across the water will not view with indifference\r\nthis black brute's ever-threatening disturbances. He watches long,\r\nwaits patiently, moves cautiously, but enters upon the execution of\r\nhis plans with monstrous method,' interrupted Littlejohn, who spoke on\r\nbehalf of his nation, and for the _status quo_ of nationalities in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n\"'I say, neighbor,' rejoins Mr. Sam Blowaway, a leader of the national\r\nYoung American party, 'pears how, if your old chap over there attempts\r\nthat game, he'll get himself boots deep into a scrape he'll not find\r\nit so easy to claw out on.' And Sam got right up, and looked brimstone\r\nat him, straight across the table.\r\n\r\n\"'I'm methodical, but not easily repulsed: impulsive acts do not\r\nconstitute valor,' returned John, rising coolly and dispassionately.\r\n\r\n\"'Grandpapa Marcy now got up to say a word or two, but Mr. Pierce had\r\nthe floor, and demanded--Order! Order, gentlemen!--Order in the White\r\nHouse! My boys want to get me into trouble, but I feel that I can yet\r\nregulate my own household!' he rejoined, with a peremptory tone that\r\nexcited surprise.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' replied the flounder; 'I say so too. If you do not keep quiet,\r\nand live in harmony among yourselves, I will be the means of\r\nswallowing you.' Just at this moment the black pig, with savage grunt,\r\nbounded fearlessly into the room and upon the table, where he\r\nconfronted the flounder with open mouth, overturned the table, smashed\r\nall the crockery and pewter, made the uproar and confusion complete.\r\nThe pig and flounder fell upon each other, wrestled among the wreck,\r\nnor ceased until, like Kilkenny cats, they had nearly devoured their\r\nsubstance. Such a chaos of excitement as followed! Grandpapa and Uncle\r\nJeff ogled one another in fear and trembling, women fainted in the\r\narms of gallant men; the General, covered with fish gravy, cut the\r\nmore sorry figure, as with thunderstruck countenance he raised his\r\nhands to protest to the nation. Meanwhile the guests suddenly\r\ndisappeared, and Grandpapa seriously damaged the broad disc of his\r\nunmentionables; while Uncle Caleb, shaking his sides with laughter,\r\nstood his comely figure in the doorway, the thumb of his right hand to\r\nhis nasal organ, and his fingers making five angles, quizzing the\r\nGeneral in his dilemma. Esteeming it rather an ugly situation for\r\nMister President Pierce, for whose dignity I had a special regard, I\r\npicked myself up, made an apology, bowed myself to the great door, and\r\nleft the General to his pig. 'What a mess you have made of it!'\r\nthought I, and straightaway ascended the cupola to watch the nation's\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMR. SMOOTH CIRCUMNAVIGATES THE GLOBE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the nations of Europe give themselves up to the sword, let us\r\naggrandize ours with the arts of peace. This is my talisman. In that\r\ncommerce which is our nation's pride there is more of greatness than\r\nwar can give, more of power than armaments can command. It would be\r\nwell, Uncle Sam, if you pondered over this; because, having your\r\npockets well lined, war could supply numberless valiant sons ready to\r\ndo the emptying of them. This was a private opinion, which forced\r\nitself upon my mind as I (having received a commission as minister in\r\ngeneral to Mr. Pierce) engaged passage in a spacious balloon, with\r\nwhich to navigate this little globe of ours, and report here and there\r\non the condition of our international difficulties. Indeed, some of\r\nthose difficulties required looking after. And as no man should permit\r\nhis dignity to take the upward turn when a penny may be turned, I\r\nreckoned on turning what I learned to the very best account. That you\r\nspend your money very foolishly, Sam, is as true as sunrise; but more\r\nthan that, you intrust your honor (which is more precious than your\r\ngold) to those who are seen abroad only to misnomer us. To counteract\r\nthis state of things is the primary object of my mission round the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n\"This I was anxious to impress on General Pierce; but he seemed to\r\nhave a wavering bump on his head, and not seeing his way clear, came\r\nto the peculiar conclusion that Mr. Smooth had a very novel head, full\r\nof novel notions. But he told me, by way of becoming enlightened on\r\nthe affairs of other nations, to keep a bright look-out, note down the\r\nitems, and see where we could turn the go-ahead of our people to\r\naccount. As most of our small disputes were with Mr. John Bull, who\r\nwas prone to keep open any quantity of very vexatious questions,\r\nMr. Pierce thought it good policy to make John Littlejohn a fellow\r\nvoyager with me. It was not a bad idea, seeing that Mr. Pierce had an\r\ninward hatred of the Britishers, nor thought a war with them would be\r\nthe most unpopular thing in the world, inasmuch as it would attach to\r\nhim the Young American party, which said party might in gratitude\r\nrender good service to his re-election. Upon this principle\r\nLittlejohn's company was acceptable; and when he joined me at the\r\nNational we had a social bit of a chat together about the matter. John\r\nwas not a bad fellow when once you knew how to take him, but he had\r\nqualities of character which at times seemed at variance with what he\r\nwould have us believe were his straightforward principles. It was this\r\ntrait of character, at times defying analysis, we had to treat with\r\nmost care, lest unconsciously it embroil us. My friend Palmerston\r\nmight without prejudice be taken as an excellent representative of\r\nthis unfortunate trait. 'Now,' says John, in a methodical sort of way,\r\n'there are, to be honest, (and acts will prove the truth of a\r\nprinciple), two great pirates in the world. You know that, Smooth,\r\njust as well as I do.'\r\n\r\n\"'No I don't,' says I.\r\n\r\n\"'But you do!' he returns. 'There's your Uncle Sam: he will steal all\r\nterritory adjoining his dominions,--in a good-natured sort of way,\r\nmerely to work out the problem of manifest destiny. As for my old\r\ngentleman, Uncle John, why he has a dignified way of doing things,\r\nalways plays the part of a bold gentleman, and when he joins a kingdom\r\nit is with a modesty so quiet and genteel. You needn't shake your\r\nhead, Smooth,--such are facts; nevertheless, they are both tenacious\r\nof their rights--a national trait of great value,--and will shed a\r\nriver of human blood to gain a very small point on paper. Like two\r\ngreat gamblers, they are opposed to the principle of give and take,\r\nstanding steadfastly by the _take_. Once they were father and\r\nson--thus, the inheritance may be pardoned; and when they quarrelled\r\nit was not to be expected the son would relinquish the traits so\r\npaternally bestowed. Now the parent is obstinate and the son 'cute;\r\nbut the son has an eccentricity that prompts him to outwit. Not\r\nunfrequently the father lets the son--just for peace sake--have his\r\nown way; but this letting him have his own way has inclined his heart\r\nrather to the ungrateful than otherwise. His demands are at times\r\nsomewhat funny, and when made known surprise a world. And now that\r\nthey are so firmly and extensively identified with each other in\r\npursuits of the noblest character, would it not be a sin to quarrel?'\r\nThus spoke John, very complacently.\r\n\r\n\"As he got through, the negro produced some liquor, piping hot. To\r\nbe good-natured, and keep cool, is one-half the battle; and to move\r\nthose very desirable traits of our nature, we put a hot punch a-piece\r\ninto the mentality of the inner man, smoked a couple of long nines,\r\nbowed compliments, and packed up our duds for the voyage. There was a\r\ngreat gathering where the balloon was blowing up; but Mr. John\r\nLittlejohn and me walked cordially down and took our seat, bundled in\r\nour traps, and sung out, 'Cut away the strings, and let her go!' I\r\nsaid I would steer for Uncle Sam, and John said he would steer for Mr.\r\nBull; so, not feeling inclined to quarrel about the point, and knowing\r\nfull well that the mother of constitutional governments (some\r\nfacetiously called her the mother of constitutional incongruities)\r\nalways liked to have the first trick at the wheel, we tossed\r\ncoppers--after the fashion of good-natured diplomatists, when a large\r\nstake is at issue. 'John!' I enjoined, 'let us keep calm, and put the\r\npoint to a test that never fails!' Here I gave him one of those pats\r\non the shoulder so impressive, and pulled out a double-headed cent,\r\nlike unto those so much in use in General Jackson's time, when shaving\r\ndecapitated the deposits he found himself mounted on the back of a\r\nbrass jackass. 'Here!' I continued--'Heads, I win; tails, you lose.'\r\nTo come the sharp over him in a more square sort of way, I gave him an\r\nunmoved look straight in the eye, as I twirled up the copper.\r\n\r\n\"'I'll take the chance,' ejaculated John, and down came the other\r\nhead. His countenance, you may be assured, wore a singular\r\nseriousness. The truth was, that John always had one strong idea in\r\nhis head, and made a strong effort to keep that one straight, to the\r\nsacrifice of all the rest. Acting upon that axiom that so stimulated\r\nthe wood-sawyer who expected to be President of the United States in a\r\nvery few years, we cut away the fastenings, and having ascended high\r\namong the clouds, sailed from the mist heavenward to the blue arch\r\nabove. Our position was not the most firm; but as Young America had\r\nthe helm, and rather courted than feared danger, the result could not\r\nbe doubted. Now and then Mr. John looked somewhat stern of\r\ncountenance, and turned pale when I crowded the charcoal. 'Be careful,\r\nSmooth,' he lisped now and then, grasping my arm as he took a look\r\nbelow--'Be careful; you know what a go-ahead sort of lot you are.\r\nYour party would think nothing of going to the d----l, if it were only\r\nwith steam power.' It was indeed a dangerous position for large men\r\nwith small ideas; but as Young America was a small man with large\r\nideas, the case became reversed. Well, we headed square for\r\nCalifornia, and proceeded at lightning speed, fast overtaking that old\r\nslow coach of refulgent light that has made sentimental the wild\r\nwisdom of the poet-world. Soon old Jacob's face loomed out upon its\r\nbroad disc, looking as good-natured as a Dutchman over a pot of lager\r\nbeer. My friend John seemed rather moody and dogged; however, we soon\r\ngot within hailing-distance; and having provided myself with a\r\nspeaking-trumpet--John having forgot his--I esteemed it good policy\r\nto, in a social way, have a small quantity of talk with Jacob, who,\r\nalthough a common sort of person, I felt assured must be well posted\r\non matters and things concerning manifest destiny. We were running bow\r\non, and at the moment I seized the trumpet for a blow, Jacob sung\r\nout--'Good morning!' just like a free and easy citizen, who had sense\r\nenough to be approached at any time without walling himself up in the\r\ndignity of that thing called a duke. His voice was like thunder, with\r\nreechoes for accents. 'Mind your helm!--you steer rather wild, there!'\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\n\"'Old feller! don't get into a pucker; there's not a mite of danger,'\r\nI returned. 'Just hold up a little, and let us have a bit of a talk!'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, don't mind if I do,' good-naturedly returned the old man. So\r\nwe hooked on to his establishment,--laid her aback in the wind, and,\r\nas the sailor would say, 'came to.'\r\n\r\n\"'Who are you, anyhow?' continued Jacob, getting up and shaking\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, I'm Young America (Jacob shook his head, doubtfully, at the\r\nname) and my friend here, is Cousin John, from across the water. We\r\nare going to take a view of state affairs around this little globe of\r\nours, that we may report to General Pierce in particular.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then you're from the States down yonder?' rejoined the old man.\r\n\r\n\"'Just so!'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah,--go-ahead fellers down there, they are! But they've got to mind\r\ntheir moves just about this time.'\r\n\r\n\"'Seeing it's you, Jacob,--and knowing that you must be worn down with\r\ntoil, s'pose we strike a trade in a small sort of way?' Jacob shook\r\nhis head, and replied:\r\n\r\n\"'Like your folks for their masterly energies, but rather not trade.'\r\n\r\n\"'That won't do, old fellow: you must come out on the new principles\r\nof civilizations. Who knows that we may make an arrangement to annex\r\nyour little establishment to these United States! Young America has,\r\nyou see, yet to fulfil the functions of manifest destiny.'\r\n\r\n\"'Don't, pray don't, bring your Young America about my dominions!' he\r\nexclaimed, interrupting just as John Littlejohn was about to speak.\r\n\r\n\"John spoke, inquiring if his preferences were not for him? He knew\r\nold Jacob would like to annex his dominions to Great Britain, seeing\r\nthat he carried out his annexation in a quiet sort of way. Jacob\r\nlaughed right out--laughed irresistibly; laughed as if he meant it for\r\nsomething. 'To be honest with you, gentlemen, and I know you'll excuse\r\nme for being out-spoken,--I want nothing to do with either of\r\nyou. You'll both steal territory; and as for you, Young America, take\r\na word of honest advice--be contented with what has honestly fallen to\r\nyou, covet not that which is thy neighbor's, but improve what thou\r\nhast of thine own. At the same time, take particular care how thou\r\nsail in this very lofty atmosphere. Your manifest destiny may fall\r\ninto martyrdom.'\r\n\r\n\"'That's right good advice, Uncle,' said I, (interrupting him), but it\r\nwould be better it did not smack so strong of that fogyism whose\r\nobstinate policy won't let the progress of those United States come\r\nout. Anyhow, Jacob, seeing that you have got such a nice stock of\r\nterritory, dotted with fascinating hills and plains, upon which good\r\nspeculations can be made in starting a speculation in churches, as has\r\nbecome the fashion, doing a little in the tin business, laying a few\r\nrailroads, and building up factory villages, we must have a treaty of\r\ncommerce--at all events!'\r\n\r\n\"'No! no! no! You've large inards, Jonathan; and your youngest\r\nson,--Young America,--has got such a pair of eyes! I'm afraid of him.\r\nNo objection to joining in three cheers for Hail Columbia, almost any\r\ntime; but save me from your claws. You're both great pirates: pray be\r\nmerciful to your neighbors, and spare me my Independence. Your little\r\nplace down there is become troubled with wars and rumours of\r\nwars;--the shedding of innocent blood in streams at the caprice of\r\nimbecile princes, who make the bones and blood of their subjects the\r\nwaste material with which to serve their incarnate ambition, tells me\r\nto beware. Beware of ambitious princes; the world would be well rid of\r\nthem!'\r\n\r\n\"'Like to hear you talk so, Uncle Jacob. Reckon how you've studied in\r\na New England school! There the greatest power springs from the humble\r\npeople. Anyhow, Jacob, since we can't strike a trade, nor do a thing\r\nor two in the way of speculation, s'pose we take a drop of whiskey\r\npunch?'\r\n\r\n\"'Can't object to that,' he returned.\r\n\r\n\"So, Littlejohn and me set about it, and in a very few minutes had a\r\nfirst-class punch brewed, of which old Jacob supped most lavishly. In\r\nfact, he liked it so well that I reckoned he had forgotten to stop\r\ndrinking; and Littlejohn felt somewhat nervous lest the old fellow get\r\nfuddled and turn everything over. John reckoned I'd better give him a\r\ncold julep to wipe down with; but Jacob said he much preferred hot\r\nthings, that his profession was quite cold enough. So, after we put\r\nthe punches down, and smoked some cigars, and received some good\r\nadvice about being careful how I proceeded, we loosened the strings\r\nand bid him good morning: it was coming faint daylight, and Jacob had\r\nto be jogging. Just as I was leaving, my heart felt kind a\r\ndown-pressed to think what gorgeous territory he had spread out to a\r\nfeller's eyes, without the slightest chance of making an operation for\r\na small portion of it--say just enough to get a foothold.\r\n\r\n\"Westward we went with breathless speed, soon losing sight of Jacob\r\nand his luminary. 'You better reef down, Mr. Smooth. Should anything\r\ngive way, and you tumble out and break your neck, the democracy would\r\ngo into mourning,' said Littlejohn, who had kept very quiet up to this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"'Not a bit of it!' I answered, 'our democracy is like Parr's Life\r\nPills, enervating and elasticating. You may break its head, but you\r\ncannot kill;--it belongs to the heart, and springs from the laws of\r\nright.' At this Littlejohn began to get dogged,--to shows signs of\r\nvery bad nature. Knowing this was most unprofitable to him I yielded\r\nindulgence. To be good-natured in cases of Emergency is a most\r\nvaluable trait; and to whip a man for being ill-tempered, when nothing\r\ncan be made at it, is most absurd.\r\n\r\n\"The world outside of the United States is inclined to believe\r\nAmerican democracy something next to infernal--that it must have\r\neverything it sees, and turns everything it comes in contact with into\r\ndollars, cents, and republicanism. To such it is a mysterious power,\r\nmoved by chemical agency. As for Littlejohn, he thought that in\r\naddition to our speculative spirit we should be governed by modesty,\r\nan example of which his forefathers had set us. This he recommended on\r\nthe principle of a gentleman who keeps up his dignity, gaining one\r\nhalf his object through the influence of his mien. Many said this was\r\nthe precise material General Pierce was most deficient in; and that if\r\nthe General would preserve more dignity and less bluster his\r\nadministration had been marked with results more in keeping with the\r\ntrue character of the nation. Old Uncle John could brag stoutly; but\r\nJonathan was a magnificent player at the same game. I realised this as\r\nLittlejohn took a long look over our wonderful West, and asked by what\r\nsingular process of diplomacy we got to many fine states, so richly\r\nburdened with natural resources? He reckoned we must have come the\r\n_smart_ of our go-ahead principles over the French, Spanish and\r\nMexicans, and then insinuated ourselves into their dominions. But,\r\nthis being the smallest end of an Englishman's ideas whittled down to\r\nthe very point of self-conceit, Smooth thought it best to be\r\ngood-natured and make the best of his calmness. The fact is, John\r\nBull and Cousin Jonathan must be good friends; strife is the dire\r\nenemy of good order, while war becomes the assassin seeking to\r\noverthrow those principles of constitutional liberty, both nations so\r\nwisely combined in their constitutions. Why tear down the noble\r\nedifice you cannot rebuild? why blight the cheering prospects of\r\nthousands to gratify the vain ambition of pedantic politicians?\r\n\r\n\"'Hallo! Smooth, my dear fellow, what place is this below?' cries out\r\nLittlejohn, looking over, as the balloon made a B line westward.\r\n\r\n\"'That,' I interrupted, 'used to be called the 'far West.' Now it is\r\ngetting to be the centre of civilization. It goes ahead of the march\r\nof progress, while outstripping comprehension. Upon this great expanse\r\nwill spring up the materials for feeding every hungry and oppressed\r\ncitizen this side of sun-down. We can already raise anything,--from\r\nmountain of corn to a river of pork,--on it; and as for the nigger\r\ncrop, there's no end of that!'\r\n\r\n\"'And that yours, too, Mr. Smooth? Your fertile acres stretch from sea\r\nto sea.' Little John interrupting, pointed all over the broad expanse\r\nbelow. He had no generalized ideas of America, no distinct estimate of\r\nher productive and maintaining powers, and less knowledge of that\r\nmachinery so simply beautiful called her government. He never for once\r\nthought how this wide western expanse was destined for the back-bone\r\nof the mightiest republic the world ever knew. People without homes in\r\nthe old world found happy homes there; civilization drove the buffalo\r\nfrom his wonted haunt to give place to man; man himself yielded to the\r\npower of progress marching westward. 'Now, Littlejohn.' said I,\r\n'seeing that your people have but an imperfect geographical knowledge\r\nof our country, let me tell you that yon black ridge you see afar down\r\nis the range of rocky mountains. Colonel Fremont, a small man, slim\r\nenough to split the wind, but as tough as Uncle Seth's whip-stock,\r\nclimbed the loftiest peak, hung his hat on it, made the stars and\r\nstripes on a rag--(in accordance with necessity and the go-ahead\r\nspirit of our country)--hung them flying in a snowstorm, whistled\r\nYankee Doodle three times and proclaimed them ours in the name of the\r\nUnited States. All this was smooth and fair,--done in the spirit of\r\nour go-ahead, all-accomplished diplomacy.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah!' interrupted Littlejohn, 'your appetite for bits of territory\r\nruns monstrously that way.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes!' I replied; 'but, John, give us your hand-on that point we may\r\nhonestly embrace, and declare ourselves now even two. You are as\r\nmodest as an archbishop on salary day, and seldom openly embrace\r\nterritory; we prefer the frank style in all our adoptions. Let us not\r\nquarrel over that--you love freedom, we love free government. Our\r\npolitical thoughts are moulded in one die, though self-interest may\r\nvary them. To be mutually just toward each other, to live on terms of\r\nfriendship, and preserve that amity which is our bulwark, serves well\r\nthat unity of great principles which conserves and preserves our\r\nhappiness. Yea! cursed be the hand, and stagnate the breath raised\r\nagainst that peace and good-will which saves us from the monster of\r\nwar.' Here I grasped firmly and earnestly John's hand, and would fain\r\nhe forgot the past and thought only of the future. Looking down, 'that\r\nis New Mexico,' said I, 'a small corner we just hooked on to our large\r\nestablishment; we let all these little ones come into the same\r\nnursery, where a generous mother watches their wants and provides for\r\nthem as circumstances demand. You, John, treat your colonial babies\r\nwith singularly cold diet; in fact, you often permit them to become\r\nstunted and ill-tempered for want of proper care in the home nursery.\r\nYou see, Texas was well nursed, and now her territory is fast filling\r\nup with the hardy sons and daughters of your land; but, would they\r\nbecome new beings, and enjoy equal rights and equal privileges, they\r\nmust divest themselves of those servilities which in your country one\r\nclass unfortunately endeavors to enforce upon the other.' John bowed,\r\nbut gave no further heed. Presently we came to the Mormon settlement,\r\nand here he set to chaffing me about equal privileges. 'We always had\r\ninconsistencies in our social system,' he said; 'just see how many\r\nwives these Mormons have got, and what a nice thing they are making of\r\nequal rights. You beat us there, Smooth; we Englishmen would never\r\nthink of such sort of thing.' John looked very innocent and honest,\r\nwhich, added to his dignity so naturally put on, was enough to make\r\none's face square up into a broad smile.\r\n\r\n\"'Permit me, John,' returned I: 'we tend well the great things; this\r\nMormon evil will work its own remedy! Westward the wave of empire\r\nrolls on; that's the word we speak as the world looks on, grudgingly\r\nacknowledging its truth. We nurture small things that they may become\r\ngreat; we make men feel themselves living equals, not inferiors; we\r\nput the lowly emigrant in moral progress, and from his mental\r\nimprovement reap the good harvest for all. By sinking from men's minds\r\nthat which tells them they are inferior, we gain greatness to our\r\nnation. Simon Bendigo is made to feel that he is just as good as\r\nBlackwood Broadway; and Blackwood is made sensible of the fact that he\r\nis no better in the body politic than any other man.'\r\n\r\n\"'Now, Smooth, just let me interrupt you in your train of Yankee\r\nlogic,' said Littlejohn; 'the safer a man feels his position the\r\nbetter is it for the nation; but the policy of equality in men, though\r\nit might do for your young place, never would do for ours. Age and its\r\nattendant glories demand different rules of guidance for society. All\r\nyour fancy articles of freedom, equality, and dignity among common\r\npeople become doubtful, when subjected to long practice. Our people,\r\nsir--take my word, not unworthily--are above considering such\r\ndegrading innovations; their grades of society are a sacred\r\nprotection.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah! those are English opinions, iron-bound. Your social institution\r\nis a perfect curiosity shop, where everything old may be stored away\r\nunmolested, but upon which the man of plain sense looks distrustfully,\r\nwhile sycophants waste contemplation in devising means for its\r\npreservation. How few estimate the cost to a nation of maintaining\r\nthose ancient inconsistencies so preserved by governments of the old\r\nworld!'\r\n\r\n\"'Never mind that, Mr. Smooth; these things are our own, and on us\r\nwill the evil recoil. Be not so earnest in condemning us, for the same\r\nsins you lay at our door are fast developing themselves in your\r\nwould-be fashionable society! Your society is fashionable without\r\nbeing refined. Your aristocracy is a base imitation of our snobby,\r\nrevelling in the heartless hording of gold, and vaunting of bad\r\nEnglish.' John looked down ere he finished, and seemed taking a\r\nbird's-eye view of the great Utah territory. The Great Salt Lake I\r\nassured him was where the venerable navigator Noah discharged his\r\nballast of salt bags. As for the settlers on its borders, they were\r\nthe followers of Joe Smith, a veritable descendant of Ham, who never\r\nwas known for the good he did. That clever mouthpiece of English\r\nopinion, the _Times_, says they will one day confuse and cause much\r\ntrouble to the people of the United States; but this is only the\r\noffspring of that one strong idea so characteristic of Mr. John Bull.\r\nNow these descendants of the veritable Smith have a fantastic\r\nappreciation of many wives--a strange delusion in which there cannot\r\nbe much happiness; but beyond this they are a very harmless people,\r\nwho, beyond the sin of having many wives (and if this be a sin, it may\r\nbe found at many a cleaner door!), may be excused from much they do.\r\n\r\n\"'One word, if you please, Mr. Smooth!' suddenly interrupted John\r\nLittlejohn,--'it is in that the dangerous element of your Yankee\r\nnature exists. Once beyond the neutralizing sphere of public opinion,\r\nyou go in for all sorts of vagaries, the more inconsistent with strict\r\norder the better.' This crimination was certainly as fast as out of\r\nplace; John was, indeed, too ready to censure us without a\r\nforethought. We had given these deluded creatures a home in our land;\r\nwe had received them as citizens, though most of them were subjects of\r\nthat land of freedom where the chains fall to give place to\r\nflunkeyism; we had protected them in their wilderness home--should we\r\nnot be generous, and forgive their errors rather than punish or\r\nprovoke the delusion? Preferring more than one wife is not originally\r\nAmerican: on that score Uncle John cannot shake clean the skirts of\r\nhis garment, nor proclaim his virtue as white as snow. Ere this\r\nconversation ended we had arrived over California. Standing up I gave\r\nthree long and strong cheers that astonished and awoke John from the\r\nmoody reflections into which he had fallen. There the great El Dorado\r\nspread out in golden plains, teeming their rich treasures into Uncle\r\nSam's apron. Then, all bright and full of busy life, rose San\r\nFrancisco, the stars and stripes waving gracefully from a thousand\r\ntemples. A thousand ships, like monsters sleeping, rode on the calm\r\nbosom of her waters;--a busy throng of merchants filled her broad\r\navenues; while houseless, anxious, and never-despairing mortals, like\r\nswine at large, rooted her broad plains for gold. A country, by the\r\naid of that Anglo-Saxon energy which carries liberty and civilization\r\ninto the remotest corners of the world had risen, like a young giant,\r\nfrom a wilderness to a flourishing State. Already was it a world of\r\nindustry, every man working for the main chance. John could not\r\nsuppress an expression of gratification,--the sight was bright of\r\npromise; but, he added, he much feared his countrymen would view it\r\nwith a jealous eye, inasmuch as it might become a means of deranging\r\ntheir beautiful organization of very fashionable society. We were made\r\nup of an indescribable compound of common people and shopkeepers, he\r\nadded, shrugging his shoulders and changing slightly his position. He\r\nforgot that the absence of two of the greatest evils a nation groans\r\nunder had brought its blessings on our land,--Mr. Smooth refers to\r\npauper lords, and lords who make paupers. Great men there sprung from\r\nthe commonest ranks to take the best care of the nation. They\r\ndiscarded the expensive nonsense of maintaining dignity which polluted\r\nindependence: they respect the poor man's rights and brighten his\r\nprospects; they seek to promote the good of all and fear not the few!\r\n\r\n\"Smooth, in humble solicitude for the reader's feelings, begs he will\r\njoin him again while proceeding on his course. Proceeding at a rapid\r\nrate we had well nigh lost sight of the El Dorado, when John made a\r\nsignificant motion, which, being translated, meant that he would like\r\nto take another glass of hot punch. To this proposition I readily\r\nconsented; after which we lighted two real Havanas, and rolled on as\r\nresolute as a flying Dutchman. It was with some effort that John\r\ncurbed his natural feelings. The punch, being placed in the right\r\nplace, seemed to create new thoughts. 'Queer fellows you are!' says\r\nhe, to talk of freedom and equal rights. 'Why, you have got a human\r\nproperty market open, and more than three millions of souls up for a\r\nbid. Mark my word, Mr. Smooth, the voice of sorrow for your human\r\ncommerce will yet shake the stability of your country. When slavery\r\ndrives this country to sectional issues; when it corrupts the federal\r\npower; when it serves the ambition of those who would drag us into\r\nforeign broils; when patriotic men, North and South, ceased to come\r\nforward for the safety of a confederation, then will sectionalism wage\r\nits angry wars against a noble edifice, whose foundation history tells\r\nus must totter under the siege of strife.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSMOOTH PRESERVES YOUNG AMERICA'S RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Day dawned through the gray mist of the East, as crowding the old\r\ninstitution, we sailed swiftly through the air, over the calm\r\nPacific. Soon San Francisco seemed but a speck in the dim distance.\r\nOn, on, on, we sped, until the land passed far out of sight behind.\r\nOur next business was to hang in suspense our hopes, and await the\r\nwelcome sight of land ahead. John strained his eyes, and I did the\r\nsame. Two hours passed, and the welcome moment arrived. 'I see it!'\r\nexclaimed John--'Land oh! Land oh!' In a frenzy of joy he had\r\nwell-nigh upset the barge and spilled us out. Then he pointed his\r\nfinger to an object in the distance that seemed like a lonely steeple\r\nholding watch over midnight.\r\n\r\n\"'I see it!' I rejoined--'it's land--a new discovery: I'll call it\r\nUncle Sam's Land.'\r\n\r\n\"'A little more moderate, if you please, Mr. Smooth,' retorted John,\r\nvery politely. 'Seeing it first, I claim the right of calling it\r\nPrince Albert's Island.' John was inclined to exchange any amount of\r\ndiplomatic notes, but I inquired, in a plain sort of way, what would\r\nbe the good it could confer on his country? to which he folded his\r\narms, and replied curtly, that having it was the thing sought for by\r\nhis government. He might institute the Established Church on it, and\r\ncreate any amount of Bishops, with good fat salaries--a thing\r\nall-desirable in the eyes of the Saviour. We use these out-of-the-way\r\nplaces,' he continued, 'as a means of relief to our over-crowded\r\npopulation and pensioners. We are heavy of pensioners, while our\r\ngovernors are prone to create dependencies, which they do in\r\nconsideration of the very large stock of gentlemen always on hand, and\r\nmost clamorous to be provided for at John's expense.'\r\n\r\n\"Having arrived over the spot, we found it an out-of-the-way island;\r\nupon which I suggested that it would be better to drop the stars and\r\nstripes, with a note to the chief (if one there existed) desiring he\r\nwould put it up in the name of our great Republic. John, taking the\r\ninitiative, began to draw from his pocket a bit of bunting; but so\r\nmethodical was he, that before he had completed the process I took\r\nfrom my pocket a piece of red chalk, and on my white, Sunday nightcap\r\nfigured the Stars and Stripes. This done, I rolled it round my\r\njacknife, and let it slide downward ere John had his Union Jack\r\nready. Down it went, like a thunderbolt chased by a streak of chain\r\nlightning. 'Put that up, in the name of these United States' thought\r\nI,--'we'll take care of that little bit of territory.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' interrupted John, looking as serious as a May moon, 'it's\r\nYankee outright: I confess the Union Jack can't keep up with the Stars\r\nand Stripes, nohow!'\r\n\r\n\"'Give us your hand, John,' said I, 'we'll be good-natured anyhow,\r\nseeing the positive proof that we both belong to the same school. We\r\nare types of two very progressive and honorable gentlemen, who, in a\r\nvery modest sort of way, do pirate territory now and then, merely for\r\nthe sake of that inevitable result the extending good constitutional\r\nprinciples has. If our small faults creep above the surface now and\r\nthen, the influence they have is more than counterbalanced by the good\r\nwhich may come. But, while we both affect a deal of modesty, and are\r\never criminating and recriminating each other's acts, would it not be\r\nwell to acknowledge the motive by which both are moved to the same\r\ngreedy propensities? Think it over, John; and at the same time let us\r\njoin--just to keep up the good-nature--in another glass of whiskey.'\r\nHe said he had no objection, so filling up, we drank to the very best\r\nsort of friendship, John winking and blinking, as a squall just\r\nspringing up began to increase.\r\n\r\n\"'That place--we were both a little too fast, John--is inhabited, as\r\nI'm a Christian. I'll bet a cotton-mill it is!' I returned; and before\r\nthe words were cold I saw a French sentinel pacing as straight as a\r\nhandspike in uniform, and as mutely savage as a scare-crow in a\r\ncorn-field. There he was, moustaches heavier nor a goat's smellers,\r\n_a la_ old guard. Not a great way behind his Saxon neighbors, he was\r\nwatching No. I; just keeping an unoffending eye on Queen Tamerhamer's\r\nlittle place. That tawny sovereign had insulted the French, but it was\r\ndifficult for them to define the nature of the offence. However, they\r\nclaimed the right to mount guard, if only to the end of getting a\r\nbetter foot-hold. Poor, hapless sovereign! she thought more of her\r\ntinsel than the French did of her rights: thus the small difficulty.\r\nFrenchmen are clever fellows in a small way, have very pliable ideas,\r\nwhich they can change with wondrous celerity; they aim to do good, if,\r\nthrough their eccentricities, they too often fail. They are pleased to\r\nconsider themselves more refined than Americans, and yet they are more\r\ndeficient in moral courage--that moral courage which is made to\r\nconserve the good of the State. An Englishman's reserve, a Frenchman's\r\npoliteness, and a Yankee's go-aheadativeness,--all contending for the\r\npalm of honesty, form the curious illustration of an eventful age.\r\n\r\n\"'Let us push on, John, across the calm ocean we shall soon arrive at\r\nShanghai,' said I, confidentially.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes!' returns John, interrupting me, 'and I wish we could get a\r\nglimpse at Japan. Other nations have supposed it impregnable; but\r\nJonathan has found his way to the very gates of the Emperor's palace,\r\nwhich he now knocks at with might and main. How fantastically he is\r\ndressed! Coal-basket in one hand, and Bible in the other, he is\r\ncutting what may be properly termed figure number one.'\r\n\r\n\"'Certainly!' I rejoined, 'that is the figure to make safe our\r\ncountry's interests. Trade and civilization is Jonathan's _motto_,\r\nWhile 'go-ahead' is the pass-word that has placed him where he is--in\r\npower. Jonathan demolishes the aristocratic fantasy of dignity, and\r\nbuilds up the greatness of a people with the simplicity of trade. We\r\nnever had the most distant annexation design on this little empire,\r\nbut we want coals that our commerce may be fostered and protected in\r\nits march over the world; and, if we chance to do a little trade while\r\nteaching an isolated people their proper position, so much the better\r\nfor the world and manifest destiny. The absurdity of celestial\r\npre-eminence must be removed from the minds of those who yet maintain\r\nit at the expense of Christendom. If we can sell the Emperor's people\r\nLowell cotton, at the same time you are selling them Manchester\r\nstripes, where can be the objection? There can be no harm in promoting\r\nthat which has for its end the interchange of good feeling between the\r\nmost distant nations of earth: interchange of commerce infuses its\r\nspirit of energy, and its results are for the good of the many. But\r\nthose interchanges between progressive and non-progressive governments\r\nshould be conducted with caution and kindness, in order to preserve\r\nmutual respect. The double-sided Dutchman prostrates himself before\r\nthe barbarian whose commerce he seeks; but in doing so he enlists\r\ncontempt for his nation, without aiding to tear down that\r\nsuperciliousness of the barbarian which is the greatest enemy of the\r\nworld at large. Better were it he approached that monarch on equal\r\nterms--to, it might be, compel him to reconcile his feelings to the\r\nforce of manifest destiny. Smooth will stand the odds that Commodore\r\nPerry gets the better of the Dutchman, comes the independent over the\r\nEmperor, and makes a contract for the establishment of cotton\r\nfactories and churches all along his coast. 'Land! oh,' suddenly cried\r\nout John, at the top of his voice--'another patch ahead.' In another\r\nmoment he shrieked out:--'There you go--good by!' As I overreached to\r\nsight the object far beneath, one of the stays broke, the balloon\r\ncareened wildly, and making a dashing circle high in the air, out we\r\ntumbled into the wild waste of space. Finding myself going, I reckoned\r\nit was as well to keep up the philosophy, and remain cool. 'You're on\r\nthe passage, too--are you, John?' inquired I, finding him turning the\r\nmost artistic somersaults in his descent. 'Yes,' he replied, in a tone\r\nindicative of sorrow; 'blast you, and your Young American policy. This\r\nis the natural result of soaring above a reasonable level.. Your\r\nmanifest destiny is finding its proper depths now!' John was terribly\r\nchagrined; he reckoned Young America was a shade too fast. Flying, he\r\nsaid, was at best a mighty poor business; once again on firm footing\r\nhe would for ever look upon manifest destiny as the most aerial thing\r\nof the fast nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMR. SMOOTH IS RIGHT SIDE UP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'This side up--with care!' said I, finding we must come down, and\r\nkeeping an eye on John, who looked as burly as a drifting ale pipe in\r\na head sea, and whispered something about Young America being an\r\nunpleasant companion to sail the air with. Feeling how much better it\r\nwas to be good-natured, I took the matter mathematically, trusting to\r\nthe best. To be always right end up is a principle never to be lost\r\nsight of. There was land below us, firm and frowning; which, before we\r\nknew where we were, we had slipped into, like preserved meat, up to\r\nour arm-pits. Poor John made an awful blubbering; seeing which, I told\r\nhim to be good-natured, and at the same time inquired if he had worked\r\nup his whereabouts on the way down.\r\n\r\n\"'A pretty affair this!' said he, angrily. 'Here, on a desolate\r\nisland, surrounded by a broad ocean, what chance is there for us to\r\nsave ourselves, or ever again make the confines of civilization?\r\nDespondency knows no joking; and, in such a perplexity, questions\r\nabout reckoning are out of place. You may make light of it, Mr.\r\nSmooth; but, if you please, let us think of some way to deliver\r\nourselves,' grumbled John, sweating, puffing, and blowing. Finally, he\r\nsaid he wished the old gentleman with the horns had made a previous\r\ndemand on him, inasmuch as it would have saved him the trouble of\r\ndying on so desolate a spot, which to him seemed the sorest grievance\r\nof all.\r\n\r\n\"'You groan over it some, don't you, old fellow? Reckon how you hain't\r\nseen a Yankee try his ingenuity. Just puff a spell, until Mr. Smooth\r\ncalmly studies a little philosophy, which is a mighty good thing in\r\ncases of emergency like this,' I remarked in reply, getting my ideas\r\ninto a fix, in order to bring out the best point of operation. Working\r\nmyself out in a cool sort of way, I seized hold of him by the\r\nshoulders, and yanked him straight out, like a log from a marsh\r\nslough. 'Now, take it all for the best, John,' I rejoined\r\nencouragingly, going to work and putting up a liberty pole, to which I\r\ntacked the stars and stripes, while John was grumbling, growling, and\r\nmethodizing about saving himself. This done on behalf of my country,\r\nand Young America more particularly, I set about erecting a hut,\r\nwherein we could both turn in for the night. With me it was sink the\r\ndesponding and keep up a stiff spring of hope; but when bed-time came,\r\nJohn made a great fuss about his night-cap and dressing-gown, and\r\nslippers,--as if the comforts of home were inseparable. Then he made a\r\ncrooked face about his bed, while I laughed at him for his whims, his\r\nfancies, and his dogged pedantries. However, morning found him\r\nbetter-natured, and taking advantage of the opportunity, we held a\r\nconsultation upon what was best to be done. That we were on an\r\nuninhabited island not a doubt existed: nor had any son of civilized\r\nman ever visited it before: not so much of civilization as a gallows\r\nwas there to be seen anywhere, although there were visible in the\r\ndistance many mountains, and plains, and valleys, and lakes swarming\r\nwith fish. With these a people might have flourished, while the soil\r\nwas pregnant of richness, ready to bring forth corn, rice, tobacco,\r\nand cotton. I was grieved that such a spot should lie wasting; all it\r\nwanted was a few sons of New England to make its resources of great\r\ncommercial value. A ponderous mountain rose nearly to the sky, distant\r\nsome two days' journey, in the west. After breakfasting on wild fruit\r\n(of which there was a great abundance) and limpid water, we set out\r\nfor it, making a straight line through the forest; but before reaching\r\nthe summit, and after three days' scrubbing, we discovered smoke\r\ncurling gently upward here and there in the clear blue atmosphere.\r\n'Lord bless ye, John!' I exclaimed, halting suddenly, 'there is living\r\ncritters here, as I'm a Down-easter.'\r\n\r\n\"'I see 'um moving!' he rejoined, nervously surveying the spot. And\r\nin another hour we were in the midst of a tribe of savages, swarthy\r\nand of vicious appearance. Such yelling, hallooing, jumping, and\r\ncutting wild antics, you never saw before, nor could pen\r\ndescribe. Nobody could have understood their chattering, which was a\r\nspecies of growl and shortly accented muttering. Forsooth! it was as\r\nunintelligible as that language so generally diffused through\r\ndiplomatic notes and protocols. Now hideous squaws ran one way, young\r\nchildren another. Dogs and cats brought up the rear, their music\r\ncombining in most ungrateful medley. John's fears became excited as he\r\nsaw the chiefs rushing furiously onward in the van. 'What shall we\r\ndo?' said he; 'they will exterminate us.' I said we had better summon\r\nall our amiability and endeavor to engraft ourselves in their good\r\ngraces. Young America would talk Yankee to them. To this John gave\r\nready consent. I was glad to see that for once he had laid aside his\r\ndignity and superciliousness: it was freely acknowledging that Uncle\r\nSam was somebody--that he could, in his plain straightforward way do\r\nclever things. Therefore, to initiate my diplomacy I drew forth the\r\nStars and Stripes, and held them before a monster chief of some seven\r\nfeet in stature, who had almost reached us, making savage\r\ngrimaces. Soon he stood before us, John commenced to bow with all his\r\npoliteness, and meekly doffing off his hat, began a speech\r\nwith:--'Your sublime majesty--' 'Stop that, John!' I exclaimed firmly,\r\ninterrupting him. Here I stepped in, and extended my hand to the\r\nsavage. 'My name, stranger,' I continued 'is Commissioner Solomon\r\nSmooth--at home they call me General Smooth. Now, seeing that I am\r\nsent by our patriotic President (a very small man by the way, but\r\nimmeasurably large when dealing in the mere language of war) whose\r\ndetermination that talent of a truly American character shall shine\r\nabroad has been fully appreciated by the nations honored with his\r\npromising plenipotentiaries, Mr. Pierce has deputed me to square the\r\nworld in general, and manifest destiny in particular.' The savage at\r\nfirst exhibited signs of concern, but finally summoned to his aid a\r\nsalutation of welcome, and at the same time grasped my hand warmly and\r\nearnestly. Communicating with him by signs was not the most agreeable\r\noffice: but when there is a point to be gained energy is always well\r\nspent. I would enlighten him upon matters connected with our\r\ngovernment, while ascertaining his ideas of annexation: this the\r\nlanguage of signs prevented my doing. I regretted this exceedingly,\r\ninasmuch as it compelled me to forego the comparison I contemplated\r\nmaking between his and those known ideas entertained by General Pierce\r\nhimself. Enough, however, was drawn from the signs to prove a\r\nstriking coincidence. 'Never bin to Washington--I reckon?' I inquired\r\nassuming the independent, as I gave my hat an easy set on the windward\r\nside of my head. He shook his head, and croaked out something no one\r\ncould understand. 'Great place!' rejoined I--'ought to come over and\r\nsee it, old fellow.' I affectionately placed my arm about his neck, as\r\nhe shook his head a second time; the small kindness had made us good\r\nfriends. Motioning John to him, he grasped our hands, led us to his\r\ncamp, called a council of his people, who said much it was impossible\r\nfor us to understand. Indeed, they set up a conflict of sound more\r\ndinning than the roar of waters. Instinctively hospitable, when\r\ndinner-time came they motioned us to sit and partake of a piping dish\r\nof snakes' heads and fried beetles, of which choice delicacies the old\r\nchief was sorely grieved that we ate but little. Now and then he would\r\nspread his hands, as if to say--why not eat of what I give you? I was\r\nnot long in becoming acquainted with our new acquaintance; nor did I\r\nfail to shock the modesty of our worthy friend John, who said he could\r\nnot view with indifference the celerity with which I walked into\r\nthings which should be touched only with the dignity of national\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\"'Now stranger,' continued I, addressing myself good-naturedly to the\r\nchief; 'seeing you are sovereign of this remote but lovely\r\ncountry--and that yours is manifestly an empire--suppose we try a\r\nlittle trade. Smooth is a free-and-easy citizen of the United\r\nStates--can meet you at and be friendly over anything. My friend\r\nhere,' (I pointed to John who seemed in an offish mood) 'is a\r\nBritisher, an honest member of that very ancient and gallant family\r\nwhich now views us, too often for that spirit which should make us\r\nfriends, as a beardless upstart; John, though extremely vain, is not a\r\nbad fellow, and at times improves on acquaintance. If his proclivities\r\nfor getting into an hole (like a toad in a shower) are at times too\r\nstrongly manifested, who so ungenerous as not to forgive the\r\nhereditary character of the disease?'\r\n\r\n\"'Umph! umph! whew!' exclaimed the chief, as he spread his hands and\r\ncontorted his face. We could not understand him; pained were we that\r\nwe could not. He felt keenly the misfortune, shook his head in sorrow;\r\nand murmured, as if a world separated his thoughts and ours.\r\nModestly, John touched me on the shoulder, and whispered:--'S'pose we\r\ncall this distant Britain? you can have the next discovery. I'll\r\nproclaim it in the name of my sovereign--it will be quite right;' John\r\nwas inclined to do the very honorable on the sly; but, being of\r\nopinion that he had appropriated to himself enough in that sort of\r\nway, I interposed a decided objection. 'Governor!' I retorted, taking\r\nthe chief by the hand--'if a good speculation you would make, annex\r\nthis little empire of yours to our great Republic. Manifest destiny\r\nwill make you one of us; but don't wait for that. Hook on while the\r\nlink is hot--you'll find it a good speculation. Young America will put\r\nyour nation through a process of regenerating: he will make steam\r\ncivilize when everything else fails; he will send his Transit Company\r\nto take possession of the government. We seek not, like John to\r\nconquer--we colonize. You may be one of us; by accepting Young\r\nAmerica's offering you may be as independent as a colored preacher on\r\nSunday.' The chief gazed in bewilderment--his people muttered still\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"John now became furious of anger. 'We, too,' he interposed,\r\n'colonize. Say you will come under the protection and acknowledged\r\nallegiance to our Queen, and yours shall be a scarlet coat, a cocked\r\nhat, and a great broadsword wherewith to fight your way in the world.'\r\nThe chief moved his head doubtingly, as his body vibrated from head to\r\nfoot. What strange opinions invaded his thoughts! He placed his broad\r\nhard hands gently on our heads, drew us lovingly to him, and smiled.\r\nIn that smile was that which said we were both good and honest, but\r\nneeded much watching. We were, indeed, good specimens of our separate\r\nnations, but the free-and-easy seemed most acceptable to the savage.\r\n'Governor!' I continued to address the chief as I turned to John,\r\n'beware of his fascinating coat of scarlet. Such things may charm the\r\nlittle; sensible men know their worthlessness. Hang out the\r\nstar-spangled banner, espouse popular rights; let the rest of mankind\r\nknow you belong to a nation whose destiny is the overthrow of kings\r\nand kingcraft on one continent at least.' Still, mutely the savage\r\nlistened. There was no getting English into his head; hence I saw the\r\nnecessity of gaining my ends by signs and motions, after the fashion\r\nof our modern diplomacy. Say what you will, mute diplomacy is not\r\nwithout its effect. At it I went, in a style that put French dancing\r\nentirely into the shade.\r\n\r\n\"'Your Yankee figuring won't play on his head, Smooth,' spoke\r\nLittlejohn, in a tantalizing sort of vein. 'He is less a fool than you\r\ntake him for.'\r\n\r\n\"I calmly intimated that he might be right, but inquired if he ever\r\nknew a Yankee out-yankeed? John folded his arms, and got his face well\r\nadjusted within the circle of his ample shirt-collar, which he had\r\npreserved unruffled during his fall. Suddenly I remembered that in my\r\npocket was a handbill of Uncle Obadiah's clock factory, upon which was\r\nbroadly emblazoned a time-piece of modern fashion. Its effect was\r\nelectric. No sooner was it displayed than the barbarian's eye glowed\r\nwith anxiety; the gaudy picture carried his heart and soul captive to\r\nUncle Sam. In his ecstacy he threw his arms about me, hugged me and\r\nfawned me, and in his joy was well nigh devouring me. Poor John stood\r\noutdone--dumfounded. The sight was characteristic.\r\n\r\n\"'Principles, in these days of development,' mumbled John, as with the\r\nfingers of his right hand he stroked his chin, 'I admit give way to\r\ncircumstances. To say a difficulty exists you Yankees cannot\r\nsurmount--to say an invention is known you cannot improve and apply;\r\nto say a remote colony exists you cannot people and govern, is a\r\ncalumny gross indeed. If they fail to gain the end they aim at by one\r\nmovement they will resort to another more bold--success must follow.'\r\nJohn grudgingly made the admission. Had he possessed the forethought\r\nto discover how the point was likely to turn he would have provided\r\nhimself with the picture of a business-like ambassador proceeding to a\r\ngreat convention with only thirty-two females in his train, as might\r\nhave been seen at Vienna very recently; or, better yet, the picture of\r\na duke's flunkey, which, being the more ridiculous of the two, would\r\nto the savage have proved the greater attraction. But John turned\r\ncoldly and methodically from the subject. His ancestors had made so\r\nmany sovereigns! he said. Nothing to be gained, his thoughts were\r\nturned now to the means of getting away from the savages. Not another\r\nday would he stay; I was at liberty to start any amount of young\r\nRepublics. Apprehending difficulty from his state of excitement I\r\ncounselled his better nature, and brought to the rescue the quiet and\r\ncheerful of his curious composition. It was the only way to surmount a\r\ngreat difficulty. Preserving, then, the calm of a philosopher, I set\r\nabout inventing something to take us from thence, to a more congenial\r\nland. Smooth, with progress in his head and grasp in his fingers, can,\r\nupon the same principle that he can start something to please our\r\nnation, create some thought for the relief of two distressed\r\nindividuals. One half the failures in the world are the result of the\r\nmind magnifying the undertaking into an impossibility, instead of\r\nsetting about it fresh and vigorous--making a determination to achieve\r\nthe object. The American nature has become bold of adventure, and one\r\nof its greatest characteristics is, never to stand in doubt when an\r\nexperiment is to be tried.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, but, Smooth!' he interrupted, 'you don't consider that we\r\nBritish officials abroad are placed in a very unpleasant position. Our\r\nacts being at all times liable to disapproval at the Foreign Office,\r\nwe too frequently remain passive for want of faith at home and\r\nconfidence in ourselves. The spirit of the Foreign Office is like a\r\nweathercock on wings; we are a mere servilage to the uncertain changes\r\nand caprices of those who may chance to be its Chief.'\r\n\r\n\"'By that, I understand you know not how to act; and to avoid being\r\nwrong you remain inactive, that course being likely to receive the\r\nmost praise. My good fellow, lesson from Young America,--act boldly,\r\ntake the responsibility on your own shoulders, and abide the\r\nconsequences. Be an independent citizen,--let your acts be your\r\ncountry's and your own;--and whatever the result may be, meet it\r\nmanfully, that moral courage may strengthen your cause. Now, then, let\r\nus set about building a canoe; let us imagine we can do a prodigy and\r\nit shall be done!' At this John's spirit became restored.\r\n\r\n\"We went to work in right good earnest, and, with necessity for an\r\nincentive, found ourselves at the expiration of three days master of a\r\nfine canoe, with which we drew down the astonishment of the natives.\r\nTwo days more and we bid them a touching farewell, promised to call\r\nand see them again, bring cotton, cloth and sundry Yankee notions,\r\nwith which to start a trade between them and the people of Salem,\r\nMassachusetts. Supplied with fish and porkmonhunter, a savory dish\r\nprepared by the natives, we set sail for Shanghai, I being skipper of\r\nthe craft, and John mate. Nothing should seem to one's mind too simple\r\nto learn, and I learned to navigate by what the sailors in times past\r\ncalled the rule of thumb: the rule now came nicely into play. Energy\r\nis the master of difficulties; the application of it is all-necessary\r\nwhen they present themselves. Adhering to this maxim I took the helm,\r\nlaid down the course, and steered for Shanghai, while John kept a\r\nclose watch on the stars. At times he would work lunars in his head,\r\nas did the Macedonians. Laughable as it may seem, John was just\r\ncredulous enough to think that savages in these out-of-the-way parts\r\nof the world were honored with a north star, and amused himself with\r\nspeculations on its identity. As luck will now and then favor the\r\nunfortunate, so we, after a voyage in which were any amount of storms\r\nand hair-breadth escapes, which it will be needless to describe here,\r\narrived at the expiration of the tenth day safely at Shanghai. To know\r\nprecisely where one is, and feel safe on terra-firma after a\r\ntempestuous voyage, makes the heart leap with joy--and with joy leaped\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMR. SMOOTH MAKES A FEW REFLECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Shanghai seemed a place of adventures and uncertain speculations; its\r\npeople were a medley of all sorts of human kind badly propounded.\r\nPerhaps I should except that numerous gentry called fleas, so averse\r\nto travellers that they at once set about biting them out of the\r\ntown. Two days in Shanghai proved quite enough. So, viewing it\r\nadvisable, we packed up our alls, and on foot shaped our course for\r\nScinde, a territory rather out of the way and very remotely situated.\r\nLittlejohn, still my companion, said his honorable Governor got\r\npossession of it in a very dignified sort of way; nevertheless, he\r\nthought it advisable that as little as possible be said about the\r\nprocess. The truth was, it was not distinctly known what the rest of\r\nmankind said about it.\r\n\r\n\"After much journeying and hardship, we found ourselves in the heart\r\nof Scinde, which looked desolate enough to have been under any other\r\nthan British rule:--we speak merely for the honor of British rule!\r\n'This, Uncle John's, too?' I inquired, touching John on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"'Beg your pardon!' he returned, with affected indifference.\r\n\r\n\"'Does Britannia rule this territory?' I reiterated.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' he rejoins, hesitatingly, 'as to that--Smooth, give us yer\r\nhand--there is something to be considered; we believe in dispensing\r\nblessings to mankind; and that all men, great and small, may have\r\ntheir share, we aim to infuse our principles, and make them understood\r\nthroughout the world. It's all for humanity and the good of\r\nChristianity; but, you see, we have for a long time tried to make\r\nthese foolish Princes comprehend the benefits resulting therefrom\r\nwithout success, and were really forced to harsh measures. We were\r\nsorry it was so, but, being the case, we, as a national sequence, had\r\nto resort to conquering. Now, though it may not be always necessary to\r\napply the principle of conquering to do good, it follows as a rule\r\nthat good must result where the conqueror is a Christian power, whose\r\nonly motive is progress and civilization for the good of all. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon teaches the barbarian to know himself; and when he has\r\ndone this he endeavors to infuse principles of trade and\r\nconstitutional government into his mind; but not daring to leave him\r\nto himself, he reluctantly, nevertheless, is compelled to subject him\r\nto his rule. I frankly admit we refrain from doing these manifest\r\ndestiny things, as you call them, with the same boldness characterized\r\nin your proceedings with Mexico. Our East India Company may not be the\r\nvery best institution in the world for governing purposes, for it is\r\ndangerous to invest a trading compact with governing powers, inasmuch\r\nas selfish interests will conserve to keep the power of the governing\r\nsuperior to the best interests of the governed, even though they be in\r\nthe majority; but the Company is a great machine for civilizing and\r\nkeeping civilized, that trade may not lose its influence. It teaches\r\nthese poor devils of natives to talk English, and, sir, can you\r\ncalculate what a blessing that will be when it comes into general use?\r\nBy and by we will be enabled to turn this vast empire into one field\r\nteeming with the richest produce.'\r\n\r\n\"'All right,' said I, interrupting his sentence: 'we will yet agree on\r\nsomething. In the meantime, let me inquire, John, why you did not\r\nadd--what a blessing it would be did they but understand the English!\r\nYour modesty and their insane bigotry furnish a strange group of\r\nnondescript governments, which Uncle John covetously fathers, though\r\nthey be the illegal issues of that very honorable dredging machine,\r\nwhose grapnels, always extended, are for ever bringing up something\r\nnew. In truth, this company so strong of power, which it sways on the\r\npenny-wise principle, and so pampered by royalty, is ever troubling\r\nhonest Uncle John with its unfortunate affairs.'\r\n\r\n\"'It never will do to talk in that kind of way, Smooth; 'twill never\r\ndo! When you Yankees make grave charges, you forget to clothe them\r\nwith style and dignity: they are things of much importance in\r\ngovernment matters, and then it never comes to much for small men to\r\nprate against powerful bodies pursuing formidable enterprises.'\r\n\r\n\"'Listen, John!' I retorted, laying my right hand good-naturedly on\r\nhis left shoulder, 'that which takes from a country without previously\r\nspreading nourishment to sustain it is a dredging machine, and will\r\nsooner or later dry up its resources. It takes out, but forgets to put\r\nin, thinking only of the present, while the future invites an\r\nenlightened policy to nurture and bring out its richer resources.' But\r\nwith these small misdemeanors we would not directly charge Uncle John,\r\nwho is at times as honorable as he is dogged; but he, fathered as he\r\nis with the responsibility, is seriously to blame for this neglect.\r\nViewing these things in their proper light, John and Jonathan,\r\nstimulated by the same virtuous inclinations, and weighing well their\r\ndistinctive prowess, should be careful not to offend by petty means:\r\nhow much better to encourage friendly relations, than wound a\r\nsensitive but worthy national pride! Promising to criminate after this\r\nfashion so much in vogue no more, we left the desolate Scinde,\r\ncontinued our way across an immense waste, where might have risen up\r\none of the mightiest and most fertile empires. An enlightened policy\r\nonly was wanted. The people were ignorant of their power and\r\nresources: John had conquered, and viewed it well to keep them so. His\r\nEast India dredge did not dissent to this verdict. My friend John\r\nthought the acquisition well approved. But the people, he said, were\r\nworthless; they added superstition to ignorance and fierceness, and\r\nobstinately opposed the bettering their condition. 'Without attempting\r\nto burden your credulity, Jonathan,' interpolated John, 'the truth is,\r\nwe well understood the nature of this people, and having failed to\r\nconciliate them in one way betook ourselves to another, and in our\r\ncharacteristic style chastised them into submission.' John spoke with\r\ngreat seriousness, never for a moment lessening his air of dignity.\r\nIndeed, it embodied and acknowledged serious mode of docilizing a\r\npeople: how much real attachment between the conqueror and conquered\r\nmust follow this system we leave the reader to contemplate. The\r\nhonorable Mr. John, notwithstanding, had a very circuitous way of\r\nconfessing the fact of having taken into his family, by this arbitrary\r\nsystem of wedlock, no end of people; still he accused Jonathan of\r\nusing his soft-sawder for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Journeying a few days through a country rich of soil and rivers\r\nturned to no account, we reached a dominion called the Punjaub, which\r\nJohn said had limits he knew not where, and was his, too. He acquired\r\nit by the same bold and very honorable stroke of policy. The chiefs,\r\nhe said, kept up a continued jarring among themselves; such being\r\nfatal to their best interests, he, as a friend, merely stepped in to\r\nput an end to their unprofitable disputes.\r\n\r\n\"As I have before told the reader, this honorable individual, who\r\nsensitively declared nothing could make him less than a gentleman,\r\nnever failed to consider himself a model of forbearance, but in the\r\nfulness of his generous soul, having conquered, he rather preferred to\r\nremain conqueror. In the Punjaub John had left his mark, but nothing\r\nto praise.\r\n\r\n\"Despairing of finding something to praise in the Punjaub we passed\r\nover into Pegua--John's also. Got by the same bold stroke of policy--a\r\nfew variations excepted! It was rather a fascinating piece of\r\nterritory, to the Rajah of which he had several times offered\r\nprotection, after the manner of that protectorate of two centuries, so\r\nvauntingly claimed over the Mosquitoes. The barbarian as often\r\nrejected it. This, John could not submit to: humanity demanded he\r\nshould accept the kind proffer. And to serve the ends of humanity did\r\nJohn hasten to the Rajah's palace one Commodore Lambert--a pugnacious\r\nseafaring diplomatist, known for his love of the yard-arm law. The\r\nCommodore would hold a parley with the Rajah; the Rajah, whose dignity\r\nwas first to be consulted, was too slow in preparing his palace. The\r\nCommodore, erratic of temper, was at times accustomed to growl for his\r\nown amusement; he now growled for the amusement of his countrymen. The\r\nresult was natural. In the littleness of his vanity did the Rajah\r\nimagine himself a very great man. He was important of those small\r\nfollies which prove the great misfortunes of old nations. The\r\nCommodore must wait in the sun, with becoming respect for his\r\ndignity. But the seafaring diplomatist esteemed the importance of his\r\ncloth above all barbarian considerations, hence decided himself\r\ninsulted. As patience is essential to the success of diplomacy, so the\r\nRajah deemed it expedient to test how far that quality was possessed\r\nby the Commodore, whom he permitted to wait two hours in a vertical\r\nsun. This was too much for the patience of any respectable gentleman,\r\nand only resulted in exciting the petulance of the before-named\r\nsea-going Ambassador, who just demolished a few out-of-the-way towns,\r\nand pocketed the kingdom for his Queen. From this it will be seen (we\r\nmake no allowance for John's acceptance of the issue) that the vanity\r\nof a Rajah and the petulance of a Commodore cost a kingdom. Littlejohn\r\nsaid this was the way Pegua slipt, almost unconsciously, into the\r\npossession of his family. The process was of itself so innocent!\r\nLanguage to praise it sufficiently John could not find. Diplomacy\r\nhaving large claims on the observance of etiquette, cannot permit\r\ninsults to go unpunished, said he. The Commodore, too, was in\r\ndiplomacy a fast sort of man, and could not be excited to anger\r\nwithout a consideration--which said consideration was no other than\r\nthat the aforesaid Rajah just hand over the kingdom. Spunky boys are\r\nUncle John and Cousin Jonathan! To that end the Commodore pitched into\r\nthe Rajah, thrashed him, bagged his dominions, and would as little as\r\npossible were said about it. Here, then, it was clearly shown that\r\nwhat John charged Jonathan with was but a facsimile of the crimes so\r\nprofusely spread at his own door. Great governments are at best\r\nthieves; and to claim a superiority of modesty in acquiring dominion\r\nis poor moonshine badly spent. With these contemplations we agreed not\r\nto quarrel, but continue our journey over Turkey homeward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMR. SMOOTH SEES A COUNTRY GREAT IN RESOURCES BLIGHTED BY A NARROW\r\nPOLICY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Difficult is it for a man travelling in a country where everything\r\nseems crooked, to keep up straight ideas. I have said crooked, for\r\nwhere nature has been most profuse in her blessings, and no signs of\r\nthe iron sinews of progress are seen; where no Mississippi steamboats\r\nmove on in busy occupation, opening up the resources of a country;\r\nwhere no bright villages hold to light the charms of hardy industry;\r\nwhere the favored few gather the fruits of the husbandman's\r\nenergy--something must indeed be crooked. Through countries enamelled\r\nof nature's best offerings, as fine as ever spread out before the eye\r\nof man, we travelled; but all seemed wasting away in the inertness of\r\nbad government. A narrow policy had spread weeds where fruitful vines\r\nwould have hung blessings for mankind. Things called men revelled in\r\nwhat to them seemed luxury, but in poverty and wretchedness a people\r\nstruggled; men walked to and fro in tattered garments, colored like\r\nunto their moral and physical degradation. But they heeded it not, and\r\nwere careless because no one cared for them. There is no slavery so\r\nabhorrent as that of the menial who has no thought beyond the narrow\r\nsphere of his servitude, and the little pleasure which his light heart\r\nmay transitorily enjoy. Here men saw no vitality in the hand that\r\nruled: hence they maudled through that deadening scum of servile life\r\nthat tramples better things beneath its feet.\r\n\r\n\"From the fertile bottoms of the Himalayas to the Indian ocean on one\r\nside, and from the Burmese boundary to wherever British rule extended\r\non the other, there spread out the same sickly prospect. There,\r\nresigned, stood outlined the same apathy of spirit, the same result of\r\nmisgovernment--the same soul-degrading influences; the same rebuking\r\nspectacle; the result of the same wealth-dredging principles practiced\r\nby a few. Cotton, corn, and sugar, would have repaid the hand of the\r\nhusbandman tenfold, nature having given it germ for that purpose; but\r\njungle grew in their stead, while bad government rioted in its\r\nfollies. Nationality had no soul, energy no lifesprings, progress no\r\nrailroads to move onward. The honorable John, having conquered, and\r\nvery modestly enthroned himself, was strong to maintain his\r\ncentralizing power, from which point he would make effectual his\r\nblighting policy. Notwithstanding this, John would have us believe him\r\nworld-wide in his kindness, desire his power made known to mankind in\r\ngeneral, and stood ever ready to have his philanthropy and his tears\r\nspent upon the sorrows of the American slave. Were they not more\r\nneeded in his own Indian dominions? A peasant clothed in rags picks\r\nhis little spot of sickly cotton as it falls from the bowl; but how\r\nvalueless is it to the poor wretch ignorant of the first principles of\r\ntrade! Yet, instead of providing for his improvement, this honorable\r\ndredging machine which so disgracefully governs a people flatters him\r\ninto contentment with promises it never intended to fill. With his bag\r\nof cotton gathered, the humble subject is pointed to a path through a\r\ncountry infested by dangerous bands, over which he may seek a market\r\nsome hundred miles distant. In its crude state he roughs it, and\r\nsweats it, puts it through--without a gin to give it market\r\nvalue!--all the various processes of damaging during the transit, and\r\nis surprised that India, with the best soil and climate in the world\r\nfor such an object, cannot raise a good and sufficient supply of the\r\nraw material. What a look of pity the wretch might bestow upon the\r\nboard of directors, sitting in pompous conclave in Leadenhall street!\r\nHappy is he, Jonathan, who, contented, knows not the things at his\r\nhand by which his own condition may be bettered. And how blind is that\r\nrule, which, having the power to do good, contents itself with\r\ndragging eagerly away the first compensation. The penalty of the crime\r\nof not developing what is given us by nature for a nation's good is\r\nthe sacrifice of a people's happiness. My friend John reluctantly\r\nacknowledged the delinquency. Mark the contrast! Had this\r\nall-bountiful India been ours, a more liberal policy would have\r\nproduced results widely different. No oligarch could have sacrificed\r\nit to its own avarice; associations would have sprung up for\r\ndeveloping industry; a policy to make the resources of the state serve\r\ngeneral interests would have been established, and the good of the\r\nmany had been kept in view. Cotton-growing, and tobacco-planting, and\r\nrice-cultivating, had been encouraged and fostered. Those rich\r\nalluvial bottoms, so fertile and yet so uncultivated, had given out\r\ntheir rich harvests to some purpose--untaxed prosperity would have\r\nrewarded the hand of the hardy husbandman. India would then, besides\r\nproving herself the greatest exporting empire in the world, have\r\nclothed, fed and made happy her benighted millions.\r\n\r\n\"Had India been ours, Yankee enterprise had traversed it with plank\r\nroads; Yankee enterprise had laid down strap railroads until better\r\nones had resulted from profits; Yankee energy had invented a species\r\nof Mississippi steamboat, wherewith to navigate its narrow\r\nwater-courses to their source, and there develope the capabilities of\r\nthe country. Yes, Yankee ingenuity had had a steamboat where there\r\nwas scarce water for a duck to swim. But why pain the feelings with\r\nrecapitulations like these? Its resources are of little value when\r\ngovernment interposes a dogged obstinacy to improvements; nor is it\r\nmuch better where a people seem at a loss to know whose business it is\r\nto give out the incentive. So long as this state of things lasts will\r\nCotton remain king, and Uncle John be its most servile and dependent\r\nsubject. It matters little that his empire is so beautifully adapted\r\nto its cultivation. He must shake off his love of those very ancient\r\nand effeminating systems of his, and adopt the modern policy of\r\nimproving and nourishing industry.\r\n\r\n\"John admitted things were not conducted on the most approved\r\nprinciple; but as the business belonged to the old gentleman, who was\r\nvery testy in the exercise of his power, he was at a loss to conceive\r\nwhat we had to do with it. That became very easy to explain; for\r\nwhereas Young America claims a right to dictate principles that will\r\naid in working out manifest destiny, so also does he take upon himself\r\nthe right of pointing out the evil of all political misgovernment that\r\nfalls under his notice. It was not the honorable manner in which a\r\ngovernment acquired new territory or incorporated weak provinces, that\r\nMr. Smooth had to deal with, but the dishonorable government that\r\nfollowed. Wherever waste and misery meet the eye of an energetic man,\r\nwho discovers the palpable cause at the door of wrong-headed\r\ngovernment, his natural feelings revolt against the powers that be;\r\nand to an American, trained in the New England school of universal\r\nindustry, the desolation seems calling upon him to take the initiative\r\nof working out its improvement.\r\n\r\n\"With me, a feeling, inspired by the best of motives, prompted the\r\nadvancing some rules of improvement; but, conscious of Uncle John's\r\nobstinacy to being instructed by youth, and with a just sense of the\r\nobstacles my tattered garments would present, the inclination\r\nfailed. Indeed, John, as dogged as he is old in experience, views his\r\nson Jonathan as a bold, reckless, and discontented fellow, whose\r\nnotions of progress he would receive with the same cautious hand he\r\nwould his, to him, preposterous principles of republicanism. He, while\r\nentertaining some good feeling for us, hath an inert prejudice which\r\nviews us as levellers, always reforming or abusing reforms. Swelled,\r\nhe says, by large notions of ourselves, generous in our expectations,\r\nand never ceasing in our love of excitements until we are safely\r\nlanded in the grave, we are become dangerous to the great family\r\ncompact. In the devil's department, says John, your Young America\r\nwould prove his energetic nature by devising some new arrangement,\r\naddition, or modification of that gentleman's sin-roasting machinery.\r\nFailing in that, he would plan some enterprise, propose some\r\njoint-account operation with Mr. Jones, and content himself with\r\n'truck-and-dicker,' or charcoal, for his half of the spoils. In\r\nheaven, your Young American would be discontented, unless he were\r\ndevising some improvement, getting up spiritual intrigues, or laying\r\nthe foundation of some new species of glory--perhaps claiming a right\r\nto entire possession.\r\n\r\n\"'You must understand, Mr. Smooth,' said John, 'we have long been\r\nmeditating a new policy for this great and fertile empire, now so\r\ndesolate; but we pursue ends most patiently, letting our thoughts have\r\nthe benefit of time, before reducing them to practice. Manchester\r\nwants cotton--wants it free-grown--that she may relieve herself from\r\nthe yoke of King Slavery; but she cannot yet solve the problem by\r\nwhich the throbbings of her manufacturing philanthropy may be set at\r\nrest. She thinks long and strong of it, but there it rests--and\r\nthere's the rub. John is blind, and Cotton is king.'\r\n\r\n\"'With us it would present no rub; give us the means, as spread out to\r\nyour hands, and the problem we would solve while you were pondering\r\nover its intricacy. We would pay good premiums to practical overseers\r\nof cotton plantations in Georgia and Alabama, who, with the inducement\r\noffered, would come as instructors--cotton-growing requires the\r\napplication of the nicest agricultural science--in the art of\r\ncultivating the sensitive plant. And to encourage private enterprise\r\nwe would offer bounties for the largest amount of best quality\r\nproduced on the smallest space. By government encouraging the best\r\nstaple, a rivalry would spring up which could not fail to produce much\r\ngood; it would open up a spirited system of planting, as well as that\r\nenlarged intercommunication of commerce which must follow.' Let me\r\ntake leave of this subject!\r\n\r\n\"From India we sojourned across the great desert, meeting in\r\nsuccession the white-robed Arab, the savage Kurd, the docile Yeeside,\r\nand the melancholy Turk. John said we must have a staff, and a score\r\nof guides, and no end of menials, and must put on the dignity, or it\r\nwould not be safe, especially now that Turks and Russians were at war.\r\nMr. Smooth took exceptions to this ruling, preferring to assume the\r\ngo-ahead, and test the virtue of a hard front, the effects of which he\r\nwas quite sure would not be entirely lost even among the Arabs. And\r\nthen, if the Turks and Russians were again at war about holy\r\nplaces--places for which a deal of human blood had been spilt for the\r\nmere gratification of a very unholy ambition--Mr. Smooth, on behalf of\r\nYoung America, might make a dollar or two by the way of proposing a\r\nvery christian plan for settling the stubborn intricacy. With this\r\nbest of all motives in view, I left John in the desert, where he said\r\nhe expected to do some good business, and, what was better, get some\r\ngood dinners. So, bidding him godspeed, I made straight headway for\r\nthe point where the pious difficulty had resulted in so much\r\niniquitous blood-shedding.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, Old Uncle John was at first inclined to make rather\r\nspare use of bear's grease to dress his Turkey, an unhealthy bird,\r\nscarcely possessing fat enough to cook himself; but, being rather\r\ndoubtful of his own culinary efficiency, had consented to receive a\r\nFrench cook into the family: and, fearing there might yet be a\r\ndeficiency, the ever-credulous old dotard was making good-natured\r\novertures to one Joseph of Hapsburg,--never trustworthy, and always\r\nknown to act as circumstances changed interests,--who said there was\r\nno knowing what time he would be ready to turn his attention to such\r\npurposes. Joseph, however, was never in his life so willing to play\r\nopen and shut with John, at the same time giving Nicholas that cunning\r\nwink so well understood in all respectable family circles. This game\r\nJoseph played, and played, and played, until the credulity of old John\r\nseemed like a cooked fish in a pot of porridge. The fact must be\r\nconfessed that Joseph was so politically dishonest that to be for once\r\nhonest was tantamount to a great victory over his traditional\r\nimmorality. Knowing right well the traits of character this Joseph\r\npossessed, Jonathan would at short notice lend a willing hand to\r\nthrash other morals into his system. However, with a view of leaving\r\nthis point to be settled by more interested parties, Smooth proceeded\r\nto the holy places, where, he regrets to say, he shuddered at the\r\nthought of how much human slaughtering it had been the scene--all done\r\nfor holy causes. Let an impious world forgive those _Little Ones_ who\r\nin all ages have lent their aid to stimulate the worst passions!\r\n\r\n\"As for Turkey, I, Smooth, would make no insinuations against that\r\nlovely but ill-governed country. Muslamism was dying by its own hand;\r\nit had shocked a world with its persecutions; it had scoffed at\r\nvirtue, and was sinking down into its own deluge of vice. The\r\nindependence of Turkey! Now, Mr. Smooth made no boast of his\r\ncommon-sense, but to such as he had it was a question whether the\r\nTurk, instead of exhibiting so fanatical a love for fighting, had not\r\nbetter betake himself to reconstructing and reforming his internal\r\ngovernment, and by that means save himself from a continual jarring\r\nwith nations sensitive of the rights of their subjects. Should this be\r\nthought an employment too inferior, he might employ himself with a\r\nplan for enforcing a more strict respect for the rights and feelings\r\nof the christian population under his political rule. It would not be\r\nincompatible with his own best interests, for it is unnatural that an\r\ninferior govern a superior race. Flatterers, and even savans, may find\r\napologies in the changes fortune has been pleased to make in the\r\naffairs of a state; but here so strong are the evidences of bad\r\ngovernment that only lame excuses can be offered for the finest\r\ncountry the sun shines on groaning in poverty and distress. The\r\nindependence of Turkey!\r\n\r\n\"There could be no doubt that the Bear had long cherished a serious\r\ninclination to do for the Turkey, the character of whose independence\r\nhe well understood. He would make fertile use of its apathy. The Bear\r\nwould cook the Turkey with his own grease--albeit, he found him a sick\r\nman, but had no objection to the meal. If, however, he had lain his\r\npaws too rudely upon the patient, diplomatic donkeyism made the case\r\nstill more dangerous. Mr. Smooth begs the reader's pardon for using\r\nthe term 'diplomatic donkeyism;' but indeed the only difference he has\r\nyet been capable of detecting between the conclave which drew upon the\r\nnations of Europe so much carnal warfare and the assinine species is,\r\nthat the former have soft heads in place of ears. These diplomatic\r\ndonkeys, ever ready to keep the world apprised of their own greatness,\r\nand without the slightest objection to getting up an unnecessary\r\nnumber of excitements for its benefit, betook themselves to playing\r\ndrafts, in which game they made such an innumerable quantity of wrong\r\nmoves, that they lost themselves on the board. The world strove to\r\nrespect the body, but having never before been perplexed with such\r\npolite players, the effort was indeed a task. With regard to their\r\ngame of drafts, such was the fear of the Bear exhibited by the movers\r\nthat no one dare remove him boldly from the King row, lest it leave an\r\nopening he was but too ready to take advantage of; nor did they want\r\nto wound the Turkey by any incautious move whereby the Bear might\r\nunhesitatingly swallow him: so they pushed and shoved until they found\r\nthemselves in a sort of baby-jumper, in which they could be nursed to\r\nsleep while the war they had so innocently kindled waged fierce and\r\nbloody. In fact, they themselves got the Bear so far into the crockery\r\nshop that no one could get him out without smashing to pieces the\r\nwhole establishment.\r\n\r\n\"Everywhere in Turkey they were preparing for war; and so Mr. Smooth,\r\nas soon as he reached Constantinople, where everybody seemed surprised\r\nto see such a description of citizen, called a meeting of those whose\r\nfeelings were so finely up in fighting trim, to whom he stated in most\r\nemphatic language that, inasmuch as Turkey had ennobled herself by her\r\nnoble defence of Kossuth, whose asylum in her domain was held sacred\r\nat the price of the kingdom, he had great respect for her, but could\r\nnot think of fighting. But they didn't seem to understand square\r\nYankee talk; the consequence of which, in Mr. Smooth's opinion, would\r\nbe the Bear getting his cubs in motion, to do some first-rate\r\nfighting. In this fighting Mr. Smooth would not have the least\r\nobjection to taking a hand, provided always that there was some coin\r\nto be made at it. However, before entering upon the fighting business,\r\nMr. Smooth would especially stipulate that all Austrian notes and\r\nPrussian protocols be used up in a bonfire, Austria be turned adrift\r\nas an inconsistent huckster without principles, the diplomatic donkeys\r\nbe driven into the Danube, and all constitutional governments bound by\r\narbitrary yokes set free. In that case freedom and constitutionalism\r\nwould fight its own battles and constitutionalism would bid defiance\r\nto Czarism. When the battle of liberty against barbarism became the\r\nissue, then Young America would join with a bounding heart, a glowing\r\nsoul, and a firm hand. We can whip all creation, build more churches,\r\nblow up more steamboats, lay down more railroads, and absorb more\r\nMexican territory, than any other nation breathing; but, in this case,\r\nwhere liberty was at stake, hold me back if we wouldn't fight! At the\r\nsame time we would pay a premium for the privilege of whipping Austria\r\nsingle-handed. Young America owes her a debt he stands ready to pay at\r\nthe shortest notice and cheapest price. 'Mr. Smooth,' said I, 'is here\r\nbefore you, a free and independent citizen of the United States, ready\r\nto chalk down the items of fighting to be done, say about how much we\r\ncan do it for, and get General Pierce, whose fighting diplomatists\r\nwill be thrown in, to stand security.' Not comprehending this generous\r\nproposition I left them to their own stupid way; and as every American\r\nconceived he had a right to his own opinions I hoped they would become\r\na reflex of the example.\r\n\r\n\"Seeing nothing, in Constantinople I could turn to account--the allies\r\nwere undermining the foundation of Muslamism as fast as possible--I\r\ntook a stroll to the seat of war, contenting myself with the hope that\r\nsomething would ultimately turn up. The fact was, I meant to follow\r\nthe policy of the Aberdeen government when starving to death one of\r\nthe bravest armies that ever faced a foe. Instead of expanding plains\r\nand undulating hills, such as Smooth had pictures to his mind in his\r\nboyhood, I found the seat of war an ungainly mud-puddle, with ramparts\r\nof savage-looking citizens menacing each other from its opposite\r\nbanks. Between these banks the amusement of war was every now and then\r\nkept up with doubtful results. That something more than ordinary was\r\nto pay I felt assumed by the grimaces of the contending parties, and\r\nfeeling a deep interest in the cause, I vaulted into the mist of a\r\ngroup on the left bank, so singularly mixed that their identity as\r\nallies could not be mistaken. To the question as to what brought them\r\nthere, they answered with unintelligible assertions about the\r\nissue--the balance, of power--the _status quo_ of Europe, and nobody\r\nknows how many more things that were to remain unmoved. The best that\r\ncould be made of it was, that the atmosphere of kings and emperors was\r\nfilled with very explosive matter which they thought it best to let\r\noff in this sort, of way. If, according to Mr. Smooth's philosophy,\r\nEurope were to remain in _status quo_, that spirit of progress so much\r\nbeloved by Mr. Pierce, and his family must die, a natural death. Was\r\nit not singular that the least discussed issue, the most prominent one\r\nof the war, according to Smooth's opinion, was in regard to who should\r\nbe the greatest toad in the European puddle? Your European puddle is\r\nno ordinary affair; kings and emperors only dabble in it at the\r\nexpense of their people. I viewed with some interest this European\r\ncesspool. In the centre there was seated on a pole, with his arms\r\nfolded, and having an air of assumed independence, a corpulent old\r\ngentleman, whose face fused broad and red, like a full moon in\r\nharvest-time. This very honorable gentleman had long esteemed himself\r\nthe largest toad in the European puddle, and was worthily sensitive of\r\nhis position, though he at times exercised it to a bad purpose. He was\r\nnotoriously square-shouldered, had beer'd a great deal during his\r\nlife, and could be as obstinate as a well-fed donkey. Indeed, he had\r\nmore than once been known to put his finger in his mouth and look\r\nserious when great events demanded prompt action, but he never failed\r\nto do his part when driven into the fight. To speak honestly, and\r\nwith all deference to the feelings of this very respectable gentleman,\r\nJohn had no legitimate right to be thus mixed up in this squabble of\r\nEuropean despots; nor should he have permitted himself to be led into\r\nit on the one side by that imperial transgressor, and driven on the\r\nother by his own beer-shop politicians. That imperial first\r\ntransgressor had the fickle imaginations of his people to dazzle by\r\npaying off certain old scores; even now how beautifully he plays the\r\ndisinterested to curtain the designs of his ambition! John,\r\nnevertheless, did wake from his years of stupor to find himself in an\r\nuncertain position;--this was manifest by the manner in which he\r\nassumed a contemplative mood. A few shakes at the hands of his rougher\r\npoliticians aroused his apprehension of being swamped in the political\r\nperplexity. Mr. Smooth paused, and took a careful view of the\r\nvenerable old man, that he might learn something more of\r\nhim. 'Stranger.' said I, 'what on earth has brought you here?'\r\n\r\n\"He canted his head, as if it were thickish, gave a dignified look,\r\nand again turned to his meditations;--'Beg pardon, but I don't know\r\nyou,' he grumbled.\r\n\r\n\"'Social's the word, John; be social, and give us an inkling of your\r\nmotive for that peculiar position you unwittingly find yourself in.'\r\nThe salutation seemed to excite his astonishment. He was a stranger to\r\nsuch familiarity--rudeness, if so you may please to call it; and\r\nturned from me, his movements assimilating to those of a turtle with a\r\ncoal of fire on his back.\r\n\r\n\"'You are who?' he returned, in a gruff voice, a scowl of contempt\r\ninvading his broad face.\r\n\r\n\"'Smooth, from Down East!' I replied,--'who do you think it is?' To\r\nmake the point more convincing, I started up Yankee Doodle, which I\r\nwhistled with the variations.\r\n\r\n\"'You are not only an intruder, but an impertinent fellow!'\r\n\r\n\"'Needn't feel disagreeable about it. Smooth--a man of standing in his\r\ndiggins, and Young America's independent delegate, has only come to\r\ntake a bird's-eye view of the way things look about this seat of war.'\r\n\r\n\"'Who the devil is Mr. Smooth? I know he has no business here!' again\r\ngrumbled the old man.\r\n\r\n\"'Don't know Solomon Smooth, eh?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, don't nor do I want to. You are always making difficulty\r\nwherever you go, probing your nose into everybody's business. You may\r\nbe a keen fellow in commerce, but in diplomacy you are impertinent and\r\nquite beside yourself. You better be off from here, inasmuch as I am\r\nthe biggest toad in this puddle, and mean to remain so. We are not\r\ninclined to know anything about Mr. Smooth; so the quicker he packs\r\nhimself and his baggage up and is off from this, the better.' The\r\nearnestness with which he said this left me no reason to doubt his\r\nintention to remain the biggest toad of the pool.\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Smooth, something of a man in Washington, holds a contrary\r\nopinion, and claims a right to know the ins and outs of what is going\r\non outside of your dominions, as well as inside his own, and to\r\ninsinuate himself into just what it may please him,' I replied in the\r\nmeasured manner of an experienced diplomatist.\r\n\r\n\"'Perhaps you have,' he interrupted, 'but if you were possessed of\r\nordinary modesty, you would refrain from intermeddling when you saw\r\nwhat a blasted time I had to keep that great Bear, across there, from\r\nbreaking his chain and devouring everything on this side.'\r\n\r\n\"'Feeling a fellow sympathy, I thought perhaps I might lend you a hand\r\nto do some of the whipping,--knowing how the brute professes to be a\r\nchristian of the latest pattern.' Nicholas had a strong appetite for\r\nthe Turkey, which, though sick, he would have no objection to\r\nbreakfast upon, as I have before stated; and, that his christian cubs\r\nmight share the feast, he had begun to teach them the straightforward\r\nprinciples of holy orthodoxy; which said holy orthodoxy incited a\r\ncraving for blood we have not yet learned to appreciate.\r\n\r\n\"The said sick Turkey had not given the best satisfaction to the world\r\nin his mode of reducing to poverty his flock; and, too, he was always\r\nready to bandy words and ostentation,--having a large supply of the\r\nlatter always on hand. He had, moreover, evinced a certain degree of\r\nheroism; nor was he ever backward in professing his readiness to fight\r\nsomebody--if it were the unruly Bear, so much the better. The heroism\r\nthus manifested on the part of the decaying Turk would have deserved\r\nmore praise had it not had its origin in the assurance that Uncle John\r\nwould lend a hand to do the fighting. Mark ye! John had copiously\r\npoured forth his treasure and blood in order that this vagabond Turkey\r\nmight still live, and be saved from the Bear's all-digesting stomach,\r\nand for which he would deny John the freedom of his city; he would\r\ncondescend only to honor him with the title of dog.\r\n\r\n\"In one sense a more generous fellow than John was not to be found on\r\nthe outside of our small world. He had been the pack-horse of Europe,\r\nand all sorts of kings had used him for all sorts of purposes. Never\r\nwas friend used better. He was proud, and yet how submissive. Ready to\r\nshed his blood and squander his treasure for he knew not what, he was\r\nequally willing to submit his well-burdened back to the kicks and\r\ncuffs of those he had saved from ignominy. Now, the very type of\r\nendurance was he who sat poised in the puddle. 'As for the Bear,' says\r\nJohn, 'he won't guarantee to be satisfied with his ordinary rations;\r\nand if he were to plant himself in the centre of this puddle I would\r\nvery obediently have to plant myself out.' Here John folded his arms,\r\nand, with a dignified air, ordered his beer.\r\n\r\n\"That John should keep his eye sharp to windward was natural enough;\r\nbut had this very same eye been kept to windward many years ago, much\r\nblood and treasure had been saved in the present. It is playing false\r\nto his national character thus long for which John now pays so\r\ndearly. But that phantom of terror excited by the Bear's growth,\r\nMr. Smooth seriously thinks unworthy of being entertained by the\r\nhonorable John.\r\n\r\n\"'You need not be alarmed, Mr. Smooth,' continued John, modifying\r\nsomewhat his natural crisp: 'I am painfully sensible of our\r\ndiplomatists having played the donkey; but why should you, being far\r\nremoved from the scene of strife, nor having immediate interest in the\r\ngame, desire to burn a finger in it? Be a man of sense--watch kings\r\nand kingcraft--go your way home in peace, and let peace be your\r\nglorious triumph over war!' From John such advice was valuable.\r\nAcknowledging the joys and comforts of peace, we shook hands,--I\r\nwished John well with his fighting, and we parted. I could not\r\nhowever, resist the conviction that John knew not for what he fought\r\nso bravely, and might have maintained his position as the greatest\r\ncock of the dunghill without sorrow to the homes of his people, and\r\ndesolation into the land of his long tried and most dependable friend.\r\nWho can foretell the ways of a Napoleon. Oh! ambition, ambition!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nDONE BROWN IN DOWNING-STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Few would have supposed that when Minister Smooth left General Pierce\r\nand his waggish cabinet he would so soon have taken a turn round the\r\nworld, and fetched up in that world of misery and wealth called\r\nLondon. But the world has got very fast, and only a fast man can keep\r\nup with it. Indeed, it were well we set about doing things fast,\r\ninstead of so thinking them over in the mind that they seem immovable\r\nas mountains. Well, there was in London just about this time much\r\nwaste of that sort of small talk newspapers now and then deal largely\r\nin, (editors are always kind enough to consider themselves great\r\nwarriors), concerning our very spunky Captain Ingraham, who, they\r\nsaid, had Kosta safe under his guns, and would blow Austria to nobody\r\nknew where. The whole, however, only amounted to the simplest evidence\r\nof what there was in sympathy and the Saxon heart. To our Christian\r\nfriends would we say--none of these things moved Smooth from his\r\nequilibrium. After all, come to the true philosophy of the thing, and\r\nit only amounted to a broil among small bullies. And, too, did the\r\nlittle skipper not take care of himself he was no Yankee, and the\r\nwhole United States would know it to his discredit.\r\n\r\n\"General Pierce, too, being a fighting President, (not a doubt could\r\nexist since the bombardment of Greytown), would take good care of the\r\nwhole thing (perhaps send to Congress a message blazing with the\r\nlanguage of war). Could it turn a point to his own advantage, he\r\nwould--right or wrong--send a fleet to whip Austria, to make her\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\"But let us turn to a subject more fruitful. London seemed like a\r\ngreat waste of dingy dwellings and badly constructed palaces, the\r\nwhole sleeping under a canopy of sickly smoke. Everything wore a\r\nsombre, heavy air--even the men seemed born to methodize on some one\r\nobject. Show-shops, beer-shops, and gin-palaces, made the very air\r\nreek with their stifling fumes. Above all, there were great palaces\r\nfor very faint-hearted people, who thought well of themselves, and in\r\ntheir prayers thanked Uncle John, at whose great cost they lived in\r\nsumptuous idleness. As this last specimen of human nature, when\r\ndressed in full shine, would completely outshine the most vain Pawnee\r\nchief that ever ran wild in Arkansas, Mr. Smooth was anxious for a\r\npeep at the curiosity. In truth, to Mr. Smooth's unpolished eye\r\nLondon looked as if it might have emanated from a place called hook or\r\ncrook, and stretched along the banks of a nauseous stream spreading\r\nits death stenches in the air, where, diffusing itself in the most\r\nperfect of fogs, it lent cheerful aid to the trade of physicians.\r\nEverybody affected great knowledge of system; and yet things were so\r\ncomplex of past errors and ages that no system existed equal to the\r\nrequirements of the present day. The municipality was great only on\r\ndinners and donkeyism. It had indeed a dining senate, but that august\r\nbody never was known to discuss the practical reform of anything but\r\nturtle-soup, and that with an horrid carving of the English language.\r\n\r\n\"The beggar, (we name the worst nuisances first), the begrimed sweep,\r\nthe butcher, the hawker, the ignorant costermonger, the 'cute cabby,\r\nthe wily tradesman, who seeks favors and pockets frowns from his\r\ndistinguished clowns--the Lord, whose rank is known by his tinsel, and\r\nthe Duke, so deeply identified with flunkeyism,--all move along,\r\nhelter-skelter, helter-skelter. And then there came the small men of\r\nsmaller titles, and the commoner whose grumbling was only equalled by\r\nhis apeings. To dine with my Lord Flippington was to him something\r\ngreat; nor could his airs and ostentation be well improved. The little\r\nman of little titles, too, stood profound in his dignity: no man was\r\nlarger, nor thought he that his own little self wasn't great. To the\r\ntailor who made him he paid money down. Of all men was he the largest\r\ndabbler in that divine essence of things called men--the philosophy of\r\nblood. But to keep up the dignity it not only required a great deal of\r\nexperience, but a large amount of tin in the pocket, which for the\r\nminus thereof was it necessary to have a deal of brass in the\r\nface. This principle, then, which is strictly in accordance with\r\nnatural philosophy, being very well developed in this worthily aged\r\ncountry, makes the truly great very great of modesty; while the man of\r\npewter greatness--that is, great because Our Sovereign Lady said he\r\nmight take upon himself the name of Sir Simpleton Somebody! always\r\nboiling over with the froth of his own follies. With tin in his\r\npocket, brass in his face, and never a forlorn _h_ in his vocabulary,\r\nis he the fellow to do brown the 'rag and tinsel.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Smooth felt conscious of his own importance, and that same\r\nwas something among the good British. With philosophy profound in his\r\nlong face, Mr. Smooth made his compliments to the new and very sedate\r\nminister, who some facetious wags called the very unobsequious Jimmy\r\nBuckanan, of Pensylvane. This worthy and very firm-fisted statesman,\r\nwho was too much of the old school ever to be President of our United\r\nStates, advised the doing of a great many things, the diplomacy of\r\nwhich Mr. Smooth seriously doubted. Especially did Smooth question\r\nhis reasoning on the breeches question, the quaint originality of\r\nwhich was Marcy's own. This the venerable statesman informed me in a\r\nsly sort of way, as he invited me to go into the back place and take a\r\nlittle gin and bitters in a quiet way, for he was inveterately averse\r\nto every body watching his movements. To live in a country so ancient\r\nof incongruities, and where not alone the weak-minded bedeck\r\nthemselves in fancy coats and flashy tassels, and indescribable\r\ncoverings of high colors, requires some resolution in the man who\r\nmixes with it, and is pleased to make known his taste for plain\r\nblack. And here Mr. Smooth and the worthy and very promising statesman\r\nheld a very learned controversy over the fact of Marcy having gone\r\ninto the tailoring business so largely as to define the shape of coat\r\nit was consistent to wear at court tea-parties. Smooth wanted to put\r\non a little bright, just to look a man of consequence, and in order\r\nnot to be behind several of his brother democrats, whose names he\r\nviews it imprudent here to insert, and seeing how he was invited to\r\njoin a dough-nut party in Downing street, while he was certain of a\r\ncard to one of Citizen Peabody's most select dinners, for Peabody was\r\nan intimate friend and old acquaintance; but our honest and very\r\nAmerican plenipotentiary said it would not do, for the obvious reason\r\nthat a man's importance should depend on what was in his brains. His\r\nvery democratic secretary having come to his sense of the force of\r\nthis argument, had made a solemn promise to put on red cloth and\r\nfeathers but four times a year, one of which he stipulated should be\r\nat the opening of the Crystal Palace, that being an occasion when all\r\nthe fine ladies were expected to be present for the purpose of\r\nwitnessing the superiority of genius over court fooleries, as well as\r\nbeing singularly fascinated with the young secretary's handsome\r\nperson. The argument here was so strong that Smooth at once knocked\r\nunder; and, too, simplicity in great men being greatness itself, he\r\nsincerely enjoined all his countrymen to let sense and not semblance\r\nhonor their country, guide their actions when abroad.\r\n\r\n\"Acting upon the principle so many of our countrymen unhappily\r\ndevelop, (thinking nobody could hear of it on the other side of the\r\nwater,) Mr. Smooth chartered a donkey-cart, put his donkeys in shining\r\nliveries, and was determined to outdo the Choctaws in making London\r\nastonished. The most expensive tailor in Regent street did up the\r\nexternal, as he had before so many of my very simple-minded\r\ncountrymen. Such a suit of toggery as it was! Alongside of me General\r\nScott would have looked shy, I reckon. And then, when the big cocked\r\nhat was spread! I tell you, Uncle Sam, there as no touching Smooth--he\r\nwas half-duke, half-beadle, and the rest Pierce diplomatist. 'If a\r\ndash ain't cut among the nobs!' thought I. The donkey turn out was a\r\ncuriosity, Smooth himself was a curiosity; and with two curiosities an\r\nexcitement was certain. My first dash was into Hyde Park, near the\r\nentrance of which stood the brazen statue of a gladiator, raised by\r\nfair hands, in commemoration of the Iron Duke, whose indelible deeds\r\nthey would emblazon on hardest brass. In this park, at fashionable\r\nhours, sauntered the nice young men of the West End; that is, the\r\nbiggest snobs of the fashionable world; but Smooth took the shine out\r\nof the whole lot, as did nearly all the rest of Mr. Pierce's little\r\nfolks. Had he, however, turned out in the flummery of some of his\r\ncontemporary snobs, and driven thus equipped into Cape Cod, a\r\ntown-meeting, to take into consideration the sending him to a place\r\nwhere straight-jackets are worn, had been the result. But in London a\r\nman may make almost any kind of a fool of himself, without applying\r\nfor a license. Indeed, the man most earnest in making an ass of\r\nhimself may do it, with the satisfaction of knowing that he has a very\r\nlarge number of very respectable families for patrons. In Hyde Park\r\nthe greatest asses (a name and the needful may be necessary) have the\r\nmost followers. Longest ears are not the surest indices. After all,\r\nmy reader must excuse me for not visiting the purlieus of Downing\r\nstreet just yet, having a few of Mr. Pierce's little folks to pack up\r\nand send home to Fourney, with instructions that he give them a few\r\nmore turns on his grindstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nHIS LITTLE LORDSHIP'S SHOW, AND A PEEP INTO DOWNING-STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Sam!--if, beside yourself, there exists outside of Cape Cod\r\nanother individual who would like to see Mr. Thomas Foolery move in\r\nstate most perfect, just send him over here: he must be present on\r\nthat day when the little Lord Mayor makes a great man of himself. A\r\ngreat man is the Lord Mayor on that day on which he sacrifices all his\r\ngood sense to an ancient and much-beloved show, in which he permits\r\nhimself to be made the fool of the farce. No Choctaw war-train was\r\never half so extravagant of colored cloth and feathers. A great day\r\nfor London loafers is it, when my Lord Mayor puts on the big chain,\r\nand issues his mandate to the sprats, who then come up the river, to\r\nthe great joy of the poor, who have it thus in tradition. Well, Smooth\r\nthought he would keep Lord Mayor's day, and to that end harnessed up\r\nhis team of donkeys, merely by way of contrasting it with some duke's\r\nturn-out. Imagine, Sam, my chagrin, when one of the donkeys took it\r\ninto his head to keep Lord Mayor's day in his own obstinate way. Not a\r\nstep would he go. However, I got another donkey, and proceeded to\r\nwhere the Lord Mayor was, just in time to hear him make a funny\r\nspeech, throughout which he made a sad slaughter of all the h's and\r\na's of the King's good English. Then he seated himself in the barge,\r\nand had a sail on the Thames, followed by innumerable beggars,\r\nsycophants, and costermongers. Succeeding this he marshalled his\r\nshow-folks into a string (such a string!), and with them caused his\r\naugust self to be moved to the Mansion House. Swarms of frightened\r\nturtles were seen hurrying away in front of the cavalcade.\r\n\r\n\"Such a set of white-washed heads--heads with all outside--heads with\r\nlittle inside--and heads nobody knew what they had been made for,\r\nnever before were seen displayed in one string. Strangely attractive\r\nwas the glare of tinsel--it fascinated the little souls of corpulent\r\nmen, and made small men more becomingly great. Fact was, Uncle Sam,\r\nHis Worship the Lord Mayor, whose year of greatness was death to\r\nturtle and terrapin, so outshone Her Most Gracious Majesty (a good\r\nlittle body) in confusion of brilliant brass, that the little woman\r\nthought it incumbent to call a Cabinet Council, before which she laid\r\nthe grievance of his stealing her thunder. At this privy council\r\nPrince Albert was permitted to be present without anything being said\r\nby the Daily News and Morning Advertiser. His Worship had indeed\r\nusurped all the modern appliances of flunkeydom. But the cabinet, it\r\nwas acknowledged, was very thick-headed, and her Majesty, good body,\r\nmust bear the consequences.\r\n\r\n\"Well, after the most curious caravan eyes ever rested upon, there\r\nfollowed his jolly worship the Lord Mayor; he largely sat in a coach\r\nof gingerbread, the tea-things spread outside, and the glows of\r\nSouchong impregnating the air. They said his jolly Lordship sold real\r\nand mixed Twankey. In this sense, however, was his Lordship more\r\nfortunate than his predecessor, who, having ascended from the soap\r\nbusiness, and himself used a large amount of that article for the\r\npurpose of washing down the wares of Threadneedle street, found his\r\ngreatest difficulty that of getting rid of the foetid scent. And then,\r\nmy Lord's h's were the things most violently handled; for otherwise he\r\nwasn't a bad fellow, and when he rode in his coach of the olden time,\r\nwhich might, by the green in mythology, have been taken for the lost\r\nchariot of Elijah, it was a serious question whether himself or the\r\nthings that held on behind were greatest. Then these latter gents of\r\nflunkeydom in frills had big sticks in their hands, with which they\r\nkept the flies from my Lord's good-natured countenance. Happy fellows\r\nwere they, and, like well-stuffed mules, only wanted the long soft\r\nears to make them marketable. Everybody said it was a big day in\r\nLondon. To have suggested that his Worship might be making an ass of\r\nhimself in this common-sense nineteenth century would have been to\r\nrender yourself a victim of hasty contempt. Smooth was just taking a\r\ncontemplative view of these things,--asking himself how many poor\r\nwretches would lose a day's work over the nonsense; how many would get\r\ndrunk on the hallucination of the show; how many poor mechanics would\r\nmake a blue week to his Lordship's honor; and how many would find\r\nthemselves in the House of Correction to his disgrace--how many\r\nemployers would be annoyed,--how many customers would be\r\ndisappointed--and how many wives would get broken heads; when suddenly\r\na crowd of filthy, dejected, and ruthless beings swept along in mass,\r\nheedless of whatever came in their way, and threatening life and limb\r\nin the onset. Then there came such a smashing of maids' bonnets,\r\nsqueezing of milliners, and frightening of old maids, as never was\r\nseen before; indeed, this, added to the many well-jammed ribs and\r\njostled beavers, seemed the most expensive part of my Lord's show.\r\nSumming the whole thing up in a logical sort of way, Smooth made it\r\namount to this:--that the Lord Mayor, just mounting into greatness,\r\ncould by no means make that greatness impressive by any knowledge of\r\nphilosophy he possessed; so, to be sure that his importance had its\r\nforce upon all vulgar minds, he suffered himself made to play the part\r\nof a monkey in a cake-shop. To this his Worship added the greater\r\ngratification of having given amusement to nine-tenths of the city\r\ncostermongers, made idle seven-tenths of the working people, kept busy\r\ntwo thousand gin-shops, filled eleven hundred chop-houses, given hard\r\nwork to five hundred policemen, who never like to be worked hard, and\r\nmade lackeydom tumultuous. And then Beadledom seemed crazed, and,\r\njoined with the many ale-bibbers, were turned out to do good service\r\nin the show. But, to make my Lord's train complete, there was no\r\nknowing how many men he had to ride on horseback, how many more so\r\ninebriated they couldn't ride, how many of a character nobody would\r\ndesire to know out of his show, and how many _ballet_ girls who ride\r\nin circuses and so forth,--all of which latter material had faces made\r\ndeep of moonshine modesty, to suit the solemn occasion. Then my Lord\r\ntopped off the little end of his show with the soup and great\r\nMinisters of State. And, that nothing should be left undone, the\r\n_Times_ must have a _go in_ at it, which it did with one of Doctor\r\nMoseley's most spicy articles, putting the whole thing into a very\r\ncomical nutshell. Quoth Sam, without the thunderer's dissecting knife\r\na London Lord Mayor would be the most beautiful of nobodys--that is,\r\nso far as sense goes. Smooth, on the nicest observation, was decidedly\r\nof the opinion that only one thing more was wanted to make the Lord\r\nMayor's Show complete--a pair of long soft ears emblazoned on the\r\nCorporation coach. The reader will excuse Smooth for dwelling thus\r\nlong on little things.\r\n\r\n\"Having peeped long enough at the Lord Mayor's Show, I felt like\r\nlooking at something more solid; so to that end I turned about the\r\ndonkey-cart, whistled to the flunkeys (kept things of this kind merely\r\nto be like other Americans when abroad), and drove into Regent street,\r\nwhere I would inform General Pierce and all my firm friends a\r\ndesperate excitement was made. Then, in glowing independence, I rolled\r\naway down Pall Mall, where the club-people--especially those of that\r\ninstitution of arrogance called the Reform--seemed much astonished.\r\nFrom thence I proceeded past Trafalgar square, where stood in singular\r\ncontrast the monument of the noble Nelson, and an equestrian statue of\r\nthat ignoble creature, Charles the First, the loss of whose head saved\r\nEngland from disgrace. How strange, that even in this day of\r\nintelligence and liberty-loving, it should stand a shrine before which\r\nvery respectable old gentlemen poured out their stale patriotism! At\r\nlast I found myself in Downing street--at the door of a massive and\r\nsombre-looking mansion (No. 12) in front of which stood\r\nmethodical-looking men with grave countenances. And, too, there\r\nsauntered moodily venerable-looking gentlemen, now and then casting\r\nwistful glances at the time-begrimmed walls, as if they would see some\r\none sealed-up in the antiquated recesses of the place. Mr. Smooth's\r\nturn-out only made a stir among them; they reckoned somebody had come!\r\nIn a free-and-easy sort of way I walked straight to the door,\r\nmaintaining my independence the while, and feeling as important as a\r\ndoor-keeper in Congress. After passing the massive entrance I\r\nencountered innumerable obstacles in the form of flunkeys, and then\r\npassed into a dingy room of immense size, which for all the world had\r\nthe appearance of having some two or three hundred years ago served\r\nfor a barracks. 'By appointment?' inquired a human thing dressed, as\r\nhe emerged from behind a green screen situated at one corner. He\r\nbowed, and I bowed, until he was satisfied I was somebody, 'Who would\r\nyou see?' he reiterates, adding another bow.\r\n\r\n\"'Well!' returned I, 'reckon how I'll think about that.' Then the\r\nfellow crossed three or four times my track, as much as to\r\nsay--Stranger! you don't go in there. Presently a batch of well-to-do\r\nindividuals came snickering out of a closet, and eyed me very\r\nsuspiciously; at which I summoned all my brass, and stood fronting\r\nthem like a staring machine. 'You must say who you want to see!'\r\ninterposes the man I first confronted.\r\n\r\n\"I here took leisurely out my card, and said 'I would like to see the\r\nDuke of Newcastle, who temporarily tied up in this establishment.' He\r\nviewed my card with a serious hesitation; at which I turned round, and\r\ntold him I would not trouble him, but take it myself, had he had any\r\nspecial objection to going a-head. They, the people, said the Duke,\r\ndid all he could with what he had to do with. If it were not possible\r\nto see the Duke, I would like a peep at my venerable aunt Aberdeen,\r\nwho was about as well qualified to sway the destinies of discontented\r\nEngland as a virgin pumpkin; and together with my ever amiable Lord\r\nClarendon, would set a world at war good-naturedly. These very high\r\nfunctionaries, Mr. Smooth was informed, could not at present be seen\r\nby common people, inasmuch as they were contemplating the problem:--'I\r\ndon't know what to do!' Nicholas's appetite for Turkey breakfasts had\r\nmade work too profound for the brains of Downing Street. 'Don't seem a\r\nsubject of this atmosphere,' said the stupid, significantly canting\r\nhis head, and giving a queer look out of the corner of his right\r\neye. 'You fellows don't seem to know me,' I interpolated, 'Citizen\r\nSmooth--they call me Solomon Smooth, Esq., that is my name.' A door\r\nnow opened near where I was standing, and in I walked--right among the\r\nDukes and dough-heads. It only wanted a bold push, in the right\r\ngo-ahead sort of way, to make myself respected. Dukes were not only\r\nflesh and blood, but owed much of their importance to the ignorance of\r\nthe people they aspired to frown upon. Dukes, Earls, and Lords, were,\r\nat this moment, playing at very un-English games for England. They\r\naffected to believe it right that the loyal people (I mean the simple\r\nand vulgar, who have hitherto proved mean the simple and vulgar) who\r\nhave hitherto proved true to their noble traditions, should remain\r\nignorant of the game played at their expense. This, Mr. Smooth thought\r\ntoo bad; however, his friend Urquhart was devising a scheme for\r\nremedying the evil, which, did he not himself fall into evil, might do\r\ngreat good to the nation in general. But Urquhart was so modest that\r\nhe never accused Lord Palmerston of anything worse than bringing about\r\nthe potato rot in Ireland. 'Hallo hallo!' a dozen voices echoed from\r\nthe table around which the all-accomplished sat:--'A rustic intruder\r\nis upon us!' half muttered the man who followed me in. 'It's only\r\nSolomon Smooth, Esq., from the Cape,' returned I, with a good,\r\nwholesome laugh. Believe me, Uncle Sam, there sat round a table ten of\r\nthe most solemn-looking fellows, with faces as dreary as a wet moon in\r\nNovember. Some of this unique body looked as if they had seen hard\r\nusage and lean pay. Others were grey with thinking, instead of\r\nmoving. Be not surprised either when I say that the gravity of their\r\ncountenance left no visible room for anything else. Hard at it were\r\nthey, straining their antiquated imaginations over a secret game of\r\nthimble-rig, which seemed of momentous importance. Only five, however,\r\ncould play at the game; and Sawny Dablerdeen, who always played on two\r\nsmall pipes, and paid sundry small pipers to do a deal of blowing,\r\nseemed in the greatest fuddle. And then there was my Lord John\r\nLittlejohn, as crusty a little snap as ever declaimed against tyrant\r\nin one breath, or turned a political summersault in another;--bricks\r\nto the back-bone was he, and all for old England, though he was not\r\nbigger than one of Betsy Perkin's well-grown cucumbers, and could be\r\nturned to as many uses. But what there is mentally in a man must not\r\nbe judged by the measure of his body from head to foot. And, too,\r\nthere was my very amiable Lord Clarendon, who attempted to out-clever\r\nmy Lord John, inasmuch as John stated, in the fulness of his\r\ngeographical knowledge, that the passage between Havana and the\r\nextreme southern point of Florida was not more than four hundred\r\nmiles, while my Lord Clarendon assured the House of Lords that South\r\nCarolina was an island. Enlightened House of Lords! But, after all,\r\nthere was a harmony of sentiment between these two noble worthies that\r\nwas truly grateful to the submissive hearts of the freedom-loving\r\nEnglish; both could spin flattering speeches: both could play the long\r\nand short; both could wince when foreign bull-dogs sent out their\r\nthreatening growls; and both were mighty of mouth when dealing with\r\nlittle chickens. It was not to be concealed, however that Dablerdeen,\r\nmaster of the board, was gifted with the unfortunate characteristic of\r\ntalking himself into an interminable difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"'Who, or from whence on earth do you come?' inquired my Lord.\r\n\r\n\"'Smooth,' I replied, that is my name; I am a citizen of the Great\r\nRepublic--come to study the way in which you are disorganizing foreign\r\naffairs.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yer a little in advance of the times--too fast, sir!' replied a\r\nlarge man most serious of face. Thinking it best to answer him by\r\ndeclaring my opinion to be that it was better to be with the age than\r\nbehind it,--and which I believe constituted the only difference\r\nbetween a fast and slow man of the present day, I let slide at him\r\nupon the fallacy of his political philosophy, with knock-down\r\narguments.\r\n\r\n\"The fellows cooled down at once, and John Littlejohn said, 'Come,\r\nSmooth! if you really are a clever citizen then you are precisely the\r\nfellow we want!' And then he conversed feelingly with me, said how\r\nmuch he liked our country and our countrymen; persuaded himself to\r\nbelieve them the real go-ahead chaps--though he, at times, thought it\r\nquite necessary to keep their go-ahead a little slow. I proposed their\r\ntaking a smoke in a rough and ready sort of way, and pulling out my\r\npouch, in a friendly sort of way, they all seemed struck aback with\r\nastonishment. One said, if we did things that way in Congress it was\r\nnot the way they did them here. They all shook their heads--said they\r\ndidn't smoke.\r\n\r\n\"'We will may it please you Mr. Smooth--Citizen of the United\r\nStates--excuse these things for the present,' rejoined Dablerdeen, who\r\nlooked as if he did not know which way to turn, or how to please his\r\npeople. Seeing this I sat down and watched the very odd style in which\r\nthey played the game. Dablerdeen did all the talking, and Littlejohn,\r\nwhom the reader will see had returned home helped him make his muff;\r\nand then there was a good deal of assisting one another to forget each\r\nmove. But Sandy always moved slow, as if he had something under his\r\nthimble he was afraid of damaging. 'That's Turkey, that's Russia,\r\nthat's France, and that's Austria--and this is ourselves!' he would\r\nsay, making the moves up or down, but not knowing where to stop. 'It\r\nwon't do to push that one, it won't!' he continued, pointing at the\r\none he called Austria. 'If you did, nothing would you get from under\r\nit. It's a costly cup with a tender handle, somewhat dangerous to\r\nturn: only the cup of Spain is more costly; but that in this emergency\r\nis of no account whatever.' They had no United States cup to move,\r\ninasmuch as Jonathan had very respectfully declined to hazard a point\r\nin European games when he withheld his ascent to a tripartite treaty\r\nfor the purpose of keeping his delicate fingers off Cuba. Now these\r\nvery antiquated gentlemen seemed to entertain some respect for the\r\nBritish Lion, some apprehension of Jonathan and Nicholas, and a great\r\ndislike for fighting, which they had been driven, or rather drifted,\r\ninto much against their imagined obligations to peace; for, indeed,\r\ndid they carry on the war tail foremost, finding everything they had\r\ndone large of stupidity. By and by a loud call rang through the\r\ntabernacle, and in another minute the platter of dough-nuts was borne\r\nin by two cooks. One, they said was Mrs. Victoria, and the other was\r\nMr. Napoleon, curious acquaintances, who lugged and tugged, and puffed\r\nand blowed; and the piping hot doughnuts nuts gave out their\r\nglows. Then the players all seemed to quicken up, as if they had\r\nsooner be eating than thinking.\r\n\r\n\"'Strange things will come to pass at times, and nothing stranger has\r\ncome to pass than that John Bull and Johnny Crappo have gone into the\r\nbrotherly-love business, by which they hope to bring about one grand\r\nobject,' I said. 'Neither had I any objection to Spain joining,\r\nprovided she kept Cuba all right. But, Cuba being so near Uncle Sam's\r\nfingers, nothing more than the common course of events was needed to\r\nlet it slide so naturally into his modest hands.' Smooth told the old\r\ngentlemen that the very best way to hasten Uncle Sam's getting Cuba\r\nwas to point out a process by which he could keep his hand out of his\r\npockets. 'We, Mr. Smooth, do not question your correctness on the\r\npoint, so far at it refers to this Cuba business, and the tripartite\r\ntreaty which we would you had signed merely that your fingers were\r\nkept off the property; but you have misconstrued our amiable\r\nmotives--we only wanted to form a trio, honorable in combination--that\r\nis, we would it were mutually understood that you do not annex Cuba,\r\nand we will not!' said my Lord Littlejohn, who spoke quite as spunky,\r\nthough with less assurance on geography, than he did to the very\r\namiable Mr. Everett. Smooth understood the P's and Q's of the thing,\r\nwithout examining further into the portfolio. It was Johnny Bull\r\nsaying to Johnny Crappo--'them Yankees 'll get Cuba!--in spite of all\r\nwe can do.' Of course something must be said in return; so Crappo puts\r\nin his say:--'Can't you suggest some way to stop it, Uncle John?' he\r\ninquires, with a quizzical shrug, adding--_mon dieu!_ 'But, by gar, we\r\nmay do him somefin yet, by gar!'\r\n\r\n\"To make rogue one honest man is one clever thing; Mr. Jonathan\r\nmistake himself in tinking himself great, when he not so great. Now,\r\ndem Yankee one grand 'cute fellow; you no catch him wid de, bird\r\nchaff,' he is supposed to conclude. Smooth very amiably suggested that\r\nit were better to let Cuba be Cuba, until the time came when, if she\r\nfelt like snugly brooding under Uncle Sam's wings, without any\r\nassistance would he attend to the little matter of offering her a\r\nroost. Uncle Sam was growing, but had grave ideas, with which he\r\ngenerally maintained his own dignity. They here reckoned Mr. Smooth\r\nhad delivered his speech with becoming dignity. Of this fact I was\r\nfully sure, for my Lord Littlejohn put his finger into his mouth and\r\nbegan to suck it, as is common with him in these his days of\r\ntribulation. 'Let us quit the Ottomans and go into the eatables: the\r\none is so dry nothing is to be made at it, while at the other\r\neverything is to be made, for there is something to eat,' rejoined\r\nJohn. They carried the suggestion by acclamation. Just then,\r\nwhang!--bang!--whiz! somebody thundered at the door, when, alarmed,\r\nthey all cried out--'whose there?' In answer to this the man with the\r\nlong rod cried out at the very top of his voice--'Stop the game!' The\r\nold fellows began to stow away their gambling tools, look innocently\r\nand vacantly at one another, as if a crisis was upon them they could\r\nnot understand. 'It's only us outsiders,' a voice replied, in most\r\nharmless accents.\r\n\r\n\"'There! I told you we'd make a mess of it,--that the outsiders would\r\nbreak in upon us' said Littlejohn, with a savage grimace, directing\r\nhimself to Dablerdeen, who it was now thought better to call\r\nGrandmamma Fudge. The gentlemen outsiders were the honor-saving\r\ncommittee from Finsbury, the members of which declared themselves\r\nlarge stakeholders in the game at the Treasury. Grandmamma Fudge\r\nthought it best to tell them, merely in a bluff sort of way, that\r\nEngland's honor was safe in his keeping--that they must not be scared\r\nabout it; not however, until they found him pedling pills and other\r\nquack medicines with the object of inducing Austria to be more\r\nexplicit. 'But, my old closeters, in we must come! Fearing you have got\r\nthe gout in the head, we are here to make an examination; things done\r\nin secret have a dark look about them; and we, being the honor-saving\r\ncommittee, have come to make a single suggestion, which is that my\r\nlord of foreign affair memory is found wanting in firmness, and gets\r\nvery crooked when he is not kept straight, which is most unfortunate\r\nin a diplomatist who smokes bad cigars all the day long. This said, it\r\nmust be remembered that old Finsbury feels sensitive of her rights and\r\nliberties; closely allied to which is the honor of Old England. And\r\nChristmas being near at hand, if the old Bear eat up all the Turkey,\r\nFinsbury cannot keep it; and we have been honied down in a\r\ngood-natured sort of way long enough.' Poor old Grandmamma Fudge\r\nlooked dumbfounded, like at times we see a disconsolate individual,\r\nwho nipped in a hail-storm, mourns the loss of his umbrella. Like\r\ndeath, it was necessary to keep close, tell the honor-saving committee\r\nto maintain their usual spirits, and call again, when in respect to\r\ntheir ancient character, they would get a listening for their\r\ngrievances. With this valuable solace, condescendingly bestowed by the\r\nancient gentlemen aforesaid did the committee go away happy, promise\r\nto be very good, and keep Finsbury before the world.\r\n\r\n\"The gentlemen having been respectfully bowed out of Downing street, a\r\nloud call was made to commence again at the dough-nuts. 'I say, bring\r\n'em on,' rejoined I; Smooth 'll help (I'd been seated a little back,\r\nwatching the while) play at that or any other game, provided there be\r\na rule of honor and economy to work out.'\r\n\r\n\"'Be a little more modest, Smooth--if you please!' spoke up my most\r\nintimate friend, Palm, who until then had seemed viewing the whole\r\nconclave with measured contempt. Indeed my friend Palm was a regular\r\nbrick in his way, which fact was most happily illustrated in the\r\nmanner he now and then threw the hard tokens at the head of his\r\nparliamentary brother Bright. It was as unfortunate as notorious,\r\nhowever, that in his dealings with the United States, his conduct was\r\nas dishonorable as uncertain. 'Smooth, you are a large youth,' said\r\nhe; 'but your reforming principles have too great a resemblance to\r\ninnovations to go down without scratching, in this aged atmosphere of\r\nours! Nor must you be so lavish of your manifest destiny policy; that,\r\nto me, is the medium by which you intend to come on this side of the\r\nbig pond and stick your fingers into everybody's mess.'\r\n\r\n\"I interrupted him just then; and in reply to a question I put, he\r\nacknowledged his conviction to be that we did things well and simply;\r\nbut he made one little reservation, and that was that we did not do so\r\nwell when we permitted the little State of South Carolina to imprison\r\nUncle John's nigger sailors. Then he said South Carolina was the\r\n_Empire State of Nigger Slavery;_ and was not aware of his mistake,\r\nuntil such I happily removed by convincing him that she was the only\r\nDon Quixote of the Union; and as it was necessary for every nation to\r\nhave such an inhabitant in its compact, merely for the purpose of\r\nkeeping alive the humorous, so Carolina filled the void in America,\r\nwhere happily her little exploits were viewed as very harmless.\r\n\r\n\"Well, peace again being preserved, we drew up to have a feast of the\r\nhot dough-nuts, when a terrible thundering came at the great\r\ndoor. Then the figure standing guard, who resembled a flour-barrel in\r\nfrills, announced the reporter of the _Times_; who said he must come\r\nin, for his folks, too, held a large stake in the game. And the\r\nindividual did come in; and a right jolly-looking fellow he was, too;\r\nand in contrast with the fudgy old conclave, seemed bright, fresh, and\r\nready to go ahead; and then he said the _Times_ and the country were\r\ntwo great institutions. 'You!' he spoke, advancing independently to\r\nthe table, and grinning the old fogies almost out of countenance,\r\n'have got to render an account of this game to the country! your just\r\nunequiliberizing everything; and my humble opinion is that you have\r\ngot the fear fever in your heads.' The old gentleman took it all in\r\ngood part; in fact (the truth must be told at times) they seemed\r\nrather to fear and like the man of the _Times_, who seldom failed in\r\ngetting by some mysterious process the secrets of Downing street.\r\nHowever, as disturbances seldom come separate, no sooner had the man\r\nof the _Times_ been smoothed nicely down with Downing street\r\nsoft-soap, of which a never-failing supply was always at hand, than a\r\nmost furious hue and cry again echoed through the old walls from\r\nanother part of the house. Alarm and anxiety darted into the face of\r\neveryone present; all eyes stared in death-like gaze in the direction\r\nfrom whence it came. Smooth being in for a share of the alarm as well\r\nas the fun, looked along with the rest, when, lo! high on a seat in\r\nthe corner, sat _Mr. Punch_, his comical face glowing through a sort\r\nof knot-hole and Toby perched on his right shoulder, growling and\r\nlooking as if he wanted to bite every old fudge in the conclave.\r\n_Punch_, to outsecret the players, was, in a very clever sort of way,\r\ntaking private notes, the subject matter of which he intended giving\r\nto his readers in a very condensed and elegant volume. This started\r\nthe players to their feet, when each seized a book, and, letting fly\r\nat _Punch's_ head, drove him scampering out of Downing street.\r\n\r\n\"Having got rid of _Mr. Punch_, and bowed the man of the _Times_\r\npolitely out, Grandmama Fudge, in a strong Scotch brogue, said, 'Nu,\r\nluds, let us gang awa to the crumpets--bring 'um hither, mya bullies!'\r\nHe drew a sort of simple contortion over his broad, hard face, and\r\nmouthed his lips, as if he would the amplest dough-nut be put on his\r\nplate. Palm, just as they were resuming their seats, insinuated that\r\nas the venerable old man was well gone in his dotage, he had better\r\nmeasure his diet somewhat after the judicious character of his\r\ndiplomacy, which was celebrated for its small doses crookedly doled\r\nout. The dish was again removed, mouths began to water, eager eyes\r\nglanced upon the steaming viands, giving out their strong glows and\r\nunsavory smells. This incited dither strong, on calling the two cooks\r\nits, after many and tedious interrogatories, confessed, in fear and\r\ntrembling, that Grandmama Fudge had strictly ordered them fried in\r\ngrease of the Russian Bear, an animal for which he entertained a\r\ncurious sympathy. And here it was observed, with no very commendable\r\nemphasis, that the precious old dote had a particular partiality for\r\nBruin's dominions, nor could be driven from the strange hallucination.\r\nAnother minute and the poor old man was in the most alarming state of\r\nmind that could be imagined; the largest dough-nut on the platter had\r\nstuck half-way down his throat. To relieve himself of his\r\nunsuccessful attempt at swallowing things beyond his capacity, he\r\ncalled lustily for Palm, who, unfortunately, had left in disgust, the\r\nstench of Bear's grease being too strong for his capricious\r\norgans. 'He! he! he! ah mun, I doe believe to heaven it's all up--I\r\ndoe!' gurgled the old man, struggling in spasmodic efforts to get the\r\nthing up or down. 'If I die,' he continued, 'with this lump of\r\nindecision in my throat, the consequences will be that no man will\r\nmourn over me.' Littlejohn, always ready to move as occasion required,\r\nsprung to his aid, crying 'Swallow it! swallow it! for the honor of\r\nYoung England swallow it! If it comes up you're a dead premier: dead\r\nwithout a doctor.' The whole thing now became a complex confusion; no\r\none knew how to unconfuse it. It was a sad mistake having its origin\r\nonly in the want of the age's appliances to our day and its\r\ncircumstances; he had attempted a nut he had not capacity to\r\nswallow. A dozen voices cried out 'Bring in the doctor.' and as many\r\nmore said the case was a desperate one. Some run one way; some run\r\nanother; 'and some never moved. Downing street was in tribulation.\r\nThen everybody ran in everybody's way; nobody knew what to do; nor\r\ncould anybody find Mr. Chesterfield, the loud shouts for whom seemed\r\nto make him a character of some importance. Mr. Smooth kept very cool\r\nthe while, thinking it best to maintain his philosophy up to a\r\nscientific point; and in that way he reckoned it was as well to send\r\nfor Doctor _Punch_, who, in such cases was an adept of a practitioner,\r\nand had an extensive infirmary in Fleet street, where patients\r\ninnumerable were healed for three-pence. Well, just as they were on\r\nthe point of making a rush, a voice cried out--'Here I am! here I am!'\r\nand in another minute there jumped from under the table a\r\nsuspicious-looking turkey, who stood upon the platter, clapped his\r\nwings, and sent the dough-nuts into a flutter about the room. 'I'm all\r\nright' he proclaimed, stretching to his extreme height 'let every man\r\ntake care of himself.' My reader will scarce question my veracity when\r\nI say the turkey looked with grave disdain upon the unnecessary\r\nconfusion, made at this moment by British cabinet cooks, whom it was\r\ngravely intimated, had lessoned of Mr. Pierce's French cook, Monsieur\r\nSouley. Mr. Smooth, about this time, resolved to leave the donkey\r\ndiplomatists, and drive his own ugly brutes home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nSMOOTH DINES WITH CITIZEN PEABODY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Smooth being a great man, as well as Mr. Pierce's minister in\r\ngeneral--and citizen Peabody being no less great in diplomacy, which\r\nhe illustrated in the most substantial manner--it became necessary to\r\nmake a demonstration: to this end did friend George delegate his\r\nhospitality in an invitation to dine with him at Blackwall. George was\r\nlarge and loose of figure, possessed a broad, honest face, bright with\r\nkindness, candor, and firmness: added to which a well-developed nose;\r\na soft, yet watchful eye a mouth indicating gentleness; and a broad,\r\nbenevolent chin, finished the make-up of the external man--if we\r\nexcept a neat pair of brown whiskers, and a head of dark youthful\r\nhair. Citizen George loved dearly his country, and was altogether a\r\nman who meant well, nor ever forgot those of his countrymen who\r\nreflected honor on their country when abroad. He had no genius for\r\npolitics, had never aspired to the class _par excellence_; no, he\r\nespoused none of their dogmas; he let littler minds revel in such\r\nluxuries. The means by which little demagogues find themselves great\r\npoliticians could reflect no fame to George: he served his country\r\nwith less noise and more effect. If he was quiet and unassuming; if he\r\nloved his country to a fault, that fault was his own, not his\r\ncountry's. How much more to be praised is he who seeks when in foreign\r\nlands to sustain the simple but grand spirit of our institutions! For\r\nsustaining the simplicity of our institutions is friend George most to\r\nbe praised. The object of his labor was the establishment of a simple\r\nbut real and effective diplomacy, from which international benefits of\r\ngreat worth might result. A few here and there had doubted the quality\r\nof his diplomacy; but no one bold enough to question his abilities as\r\na diplomatist had yet been found. It is not what we are supposed to\r\ndo, but what we really do, that ought to entitle us to respect. And\r\nhad not citizen George done more to promote a kindly feeling between\r\nthe too boastful peoples of England and America than all our well-paid\r\nministers, their court luxuries, and costly retinues thrown in? That\r\ncitizen George would interpose for peace and international harmony, in\r\nthe event of an unfortunate misunderstanding between the two\r\ncountries, was equally certain; indeed he had more than once had\r\noccasion to view with feelings of commiseration those small jealousies\r\nagainst which great minds have to contend while seeking to carry out\r\nan enlarged policy. Painful as may be the assertion, it is\r\nnevertheless true, that whenever questions of an intricate nature\r\narose those whose legitimate business it was to act in the matter were\r\neither moved by the narrowest aspirations of party, or, yielding to\r\ntheir own more contracted views, were disposed to keep alive\r\ndissensions blighting to their country's best interests.\r\n\r\n\"Deeper than etiquette and quibble (those much-beloved virtues of the\r\ntime-serving and polite corps) had friend George delved into the\r\nrecesses of human nature, that he might find a law upon which to build\r\na comity of enlarged sentiment, having for its end the bringing\r\ntogether of Americans and Englishmen, cementing the bonds of\r\ncommercial intercourse, and pledging the continuance of peace. Those\r\nwhom he thus worthily drew together did he enjoin to cease their small\r\njars and partake of his large jar, which was always plentifully\r\nstored. Be not surprised, then, when Smooth tells all his readers in\r\ngeneral, and General Pierce in particular, that Citizen Peabody has\r\nfounded a dinner diplomacy, contrasted with which all other species of\r\nthe order are but secondary. This was indeed the means by which he\r\nhoped to, and no doubt would, develop a more fruitful international\r\npolicy; for, meats and good drinks being never-failing arguments with\r\nfat Aldermen and Statesmen, who could doubt it? Smooth would here say\r\nto Uncle Sam, that there is no mistake about the effect of this sort\r\nof diplomacy, and begs that he will insinuate to Mr. Pierce the\r\npropriety of his suggesting to Congress through the medium of his next\r\nAnnual Message (he will make a hit) the propriety of sending abroad\r\ngood cooks instead of bad ministers. They must be well provided with\r\ngold eagles, and give the very best sort of dinners to every hungry\r\ncitizen, at Sam's account; the boy will then shine in all his glory!\r\nNever dealing in sarcasms, nor casting reflections of an insinuating\r\ncharacter, yet, Mr. Smooth cannot forbear to say that while the very\r\npolite worship at the shrine of the polished _corps_, stronger-minded\r\nmen are always found doing homage to the meats and drinks--more\r\nparticularly when they are good! Upon this most modern but very\r\nmaterial principle of natural philosophy (with a great heart, and\r\nintentions to correspond) did our worthy and truly characteristic\r\ncountryman pursue to usefulness his diplomacy. That it had excited the\r\nfear of small politicians and antiquated and very polite diplomats,\r\nwhose trade it seriously damaged, was well known to Mr. Pierce and the\r\nworld in general. Even this species of gentry was at times disposed to\r\npay it compliment; but it was only on the ground of its relieving them\r\nof that _onerous tax_ of now and then receiving their fellow-citizens\r\nrespectably. Smooth is exceedingly delicate about mentioning here the\r\nonerousness of this tax, inasmuch as our parsimonious government has\r\nproved itself obstinately opposed to grant a sum requisite to the\r\nnecessary respectability to be maintained at foreign courts.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the day arrived on which Smooth was to dine with Citizen\r\nGeorge, and not the smallest idea had he of meeting another stray\r\ncitizen. Happy in the enjoyment of our own greatness, Smooth expected\r\nto learn something of Uncle George's opinions upon international\r\nquestions in general, and to give him in return some account of\r\nGeneral Pierce's crooked notions of a national policy--so crooked,\r\nindeed, that they left him alike the laughing-stock of friends and\r\nfoes. This was very easily done, for, being Mr. Pierce's special\r\nminister to everywhere in general, and more particularly to Europe,\r\nwhere he invested him (Smooth) with power to draw up preliminaries for\r\nthe 'Ostend Convention,' as well as to cut a figure on behalf of Young\r\nAmerica, the power thus given made the divulging Mr. Pierce's policy\r\nno breach of confidence. As for Young America, that very unassuming\r\nyoung gentleman was being gloriously represented by the very famous\r\nhouse of the three S.'s and Co. (Sickles, Saunders, Souley, Buckhanan\r\n& Co.), the latter very respectable gentleman having been received\r\ninto the firm with the specific understanding that he sell out his\r\nlarge stock of old fogyism, and invest the proceeds in manifest\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is so easily attained as the flattery of small men; and yet\r\nno essence is more delicious to the soul of a sycophant, for it is he\r\nthat loves to refresh his recreant spirit with human frailty. Mr.\r\nPierce's comprehensive and very elastic mind had not yet made a point\r\nof analysing this as properly as it was capable of being.\r\n\r\n\"Doing himself (Smooth) up in his very best fixings, he chartered a\r\nsteamboat--that is, he got aboard a steamboat--and in the company of\r\nour very gallant Secretary of Legation (who has since joined the very\r\nexcellent and honorable order of doubtful politicians), paid his\r\npennies and steamed away for Blackwall. Here he and his friend sought\r\nthe Brunswick, a very grand hotel, where now and then the vulgar do\r\ndine, and console their love of fashion with much show of dishes and\r\nvery aristocratic prices. And now, to Smooth's utter astonishment, on\r\nbeing bowed into a gorgeous hall by lackies in ordinary, who stood\r\nlike tailored mummies along the halls and passages, he found it taken\r\npossession of by some hundred and fifty of both sexes, gaily attired,\r\nand altogether presenting the brightness of a bridal party. There were\r\nknights and baronets, great and small; some wore an insignia, but\r\nnothing else to distinguish them from the very vulgar. And, too, there\r\nwas Sir William Busey, a good diner-out, and always ready to do such\r\nnoble deeds. All stiff and staid, sallied up and down Sir James Muke,\r\naffecting to feel much annoyed because vulgar citizens would not\r\nregard him in the same distinguished light in which he contemplated\r\nhimself. Indeed, were Sir James's manners taken in evidence of his\r\ndistinguished position, the verdict could not fail to be in favor of\r\nhis only being set down a very distinguished bore. However, on the\r\nprinciple of forgiveness being sweet, did Smooth forgive Sir James,\r\nand charge his manners to defect of early bringing up.\r\n\r\n\"And, too, there was, all reserve, smiling and dignified, Sir\r\nMemberman Plenat, who wore no toy of rank, that article being largely\r\ndeveloped in his manly bearing. There were also, be it known, other\r\nbarons and baronets, some of whom were equally imbued with their own\r\nimportance, others quite modest and gentlemanly in their demeanor.\r\nBut, to make the greatness of the occasion complete, there was the\r\nlittle Lord Mayor, who, like a mirror reflecting a sun-shower, loomed\r\nforth in all the greatness of his own light. Of ladies there was no\r\nlack. Some were of well established celebrity; others were decked in\r\ncostly fabrics to create a celebrity; a third were fair to look\r\nupon. The English ladies seemed round of person, buoyant and joyous of\r\nsoul: the American queens of beauty (their faces sparkling of love and\r\ngentleness) moved to and fro, like sylphs of some fairy land, making\r\nsplendid the scene. The dashing New Yorker, her smiles, unerring\r\narrows, piercing whither she shot them; the vivacious and intelligent\r\ndaughter of Massachusetts, all sensitive, modest, and graceful; the\r\nplacid _belle_ of Pennsylvania, whose fair complexion drew upon her\r\nall admiration; the bright-eyed Buckeye, with face so oval, than whom\r\nnone was more coy, nor ever shot a glance or stole a heart so well;\r\nthe rustic daughter of Down East, who affected great contempt for all\r\nsuperior people, and declared the queen not a whit better than anybody\r\nelse; the buxom Green-mountain girl, whose motion was as crude as her\r\ncheeks were rosy; the New Hampshire prude, lisping, regardless of\r\nMurray; the statue-like Baltimorean, with queenly figure and all\r\nlovely face, dazzling in her beauty, like a diamond among stones less\r\nbrilliant; the flirting blonde of Washington; the gracious Virginian,\r\nwith features so classic and serene; the daisy-like daughter of\r\nConnecticut, ever ready to give out her wild unmeasured laugh--all\r\nwere there. And then there came the imperious Carolinian, whose\r\nstately step, Grecian face, dark, languishing eyes, and thoughtful\r\ncountenance, drew upon her the admiration of many an envious eye. And,\r\nto make complete the group, there moved haughtily along the proud\r\nMadame of Alabama, affecting the possession of each good and gentle\r\nattribute of womankind. She would have us know how much attention she\r\ndrew upon her while being presented to 'England's queen,' forgetting\r\nthat it was merely the effect of her badly arranged lace. Indeed, the\r\nconclave mingled most socially. My Lady Flippington seemed not above a\r\nmodest and very sensible condescension to the very level of the vulgar\r\nwho surrounded her, and whose friendship she seemed to court.\r\n\r\n\"Citizen Peabody, as much good nature in his broad face as benevolence\r\nin his great heart, moved king among his guests, bestowing a smile\r\nhere, and a cheering word there; but more particularly consoling the\r\nold maids, with whom he is a great favorite. No sooner had the genteel\r\nwaiter announced the readiness of the festive board, than each gallant\r\nsought him a fair partner, and filed off in procession, those not\r\nfortunate enough to possess such an accompaniment being compelled to\r\nbear up with one of their own harder sex. Smooth was among the most\r\nfortunate, having succeeded in fettering himself to a Kentucky\r\n_belle_. Down a long, circular stairway, the procession proceeded,\r\ninspirited by sweet music, and soon reached a spacious hall, set out\r\nwith tables stretching along its whole length, and bedecked with the\r\nchoicest viands, delicately overlaid with fresh-plucked flowers,\r\nimpregnating the very air with their delicious odors. Indeed they\r\nlooked more like beds of bright flowers trellised with silver and\r\ngold. A din of confused voices resounded throughout the hall as all\r\ntook seats who could, while not a few added to the confusion by\r\nappropriating to themselves the seats of others. Mr. Smooth, being a\r\nman of the world, and Mr. Pierce's minister extraordinary, took the\r\nbest seat he could find, and made himself quite at home. Opposite him\r\nloomed out the hard, knotty face of Sir James Muke, who, suffering\r\nunder the most painful grievance of having been deprived of his seat,\r\nso generously provided in a space to the right of the chairman, let\r\nloose some very unfashionable and badly moulded oaths. As if this were\r\nnot enough, Sir James, whose temper had fairly boiled over, and to the\r\ngreat annoyance of less dignified ears than his own, did hurl most\r\nindiscriminately at the heads of astonished waiters several oaths less\r\nvile, but more pointed. 'Soup! soup!' he demanded impatiently, at the\r\nvery top of his voice--a voice that sounded like the creaking of a\r\ndoor troubled with a chronic disease. Albeit there was no measuring\r\nthe latitude Sir James would have allowed his feelings to take in\r\ndemanding _soup_, and be-d----mn the astonished servants, had not Lady\r\nConstance Caution, who sat all calm at his left, reminded him in\r\nsoftest accents that 'Citizen Peabody always invoked a blessing before\r\nhe gave soup.' Sir James in response kindly thanked my lady for her\r\ntimely admonition, listened to the blessing as it fell solemnly upon\r\nhis ear, bowed and extended his plate as the spontaneous Amen\r\nconcluded the seemingly anxious moment. Calm but well directed was my\r\nlady's rebuke; deeply did it tell upon Sir James, who, more in\r\nimitation of Smooth's coarse manners, behaved henceforth with more\r\nregard to the feelings of those near him.\r\n\r\n\"It was now time to discuss the well-ordained set-out of viands.\r\nRound after round, the most delicious, came on with that disorder so\r\ncharacteristic of English servants. It will, Uncle Sam, be scarcely\r\nnecessary for Smooth to add that great skill was displayed in safely\r\ndepositing the meats and drinks in nature's most appropriate depot.\r\nMost cheerfully was it performed to the accompaniment of music, merry\r\nlaughs, and flashes of well-worn wit: the only discord discoverable,\r\nor which could offend delicate ears, being that one or two English\r\nGentlemen, of very polished manners, obstinately refused to be\r\ncontented with the long list of wines provided by the generous host,\r\nand must needs display their cultivated taste by ordering bottles of a\r\nname scarce known, assuring the polite landlord that they themselves\r\nwould pay the shot _did Citizen Peabody fail to stand it_. Mr. Smooth\r\nhad not the least objection to this delicate proceeding inasmuch as it\r\nillustrated a principle, and contrasted strangely with those much\r\ncultivated manners facetious gentlemen who so often waste ink in\r\ndiscoursing upon the vulgarities of Americans would have us fashion\r\nfrom. Wishing, however, these gentlemen may display better manners\r\nnext time, we must beg the reader's pardon for thus digressing and\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\"The meats having laid a very decided foundation upon which to build a\r\ntabernacle of joviality, and the nectar adding its exhilarating power\r\nin erecting a substratum for the fine work of the festival, it became\r\nnecessary to top off with spicy speeches, which might indeed be\r\ncompared to a compound of salt and cream very liberally mixed. From\r\namong his guests and great folks Citizen Peabody now rose, somewhat\r\nnervous, and with becoming dignity delivered himself of a very piquant\r\nspeech, the bone and marrow of which was that Americans from home\r\nbeing moved by those sentiments the appearance of things new and\r\nstrange naturally produce, the sequence was that they looked with an\r\ninterest divided between reverence and curiosity to see their\r\nMinister; such a gratification he was only too happy in being the\r\nmedium of affording. Nor, when he relieved that worthy representative\r\nof a tax his purse could ill bear, did he consider it less than a very\r\nagreeable duty. In reply to Citizen Peabody's toast, 'Peace and\r\ncontinued friendship between the peoples of England and the United\r\nStates,' the guests filled a bumper, and with three hearty cheers let\r\nthe liquid run down so smoothly. Sir Arthur Coddlecomb's name being\r\ncoupled with the toast, and that compound of self-importance and bad\r\ngrammar esteeming himself a great speaker, rose, and relieved himself\r\nof what is commonly called a very neat and appropriate speech. To\r\nSmooth his mind seemed on a wandering expedition; notwithstanding, he\r\ntook occasion to refer to that approaching curse--an Eastern war, and\r\nalso to divest himself of some very fine words, highly complimentary\r\nof America. Marked applause followed the speech, and Sir Arthur sat\r\ndown bowing.\r\n\r\n\"'The present Lord Mayor!' being drawn into the order of toasts, the\r\nindividual filling that office, a firmly compacted figure, with\r\nwell-rounded limbs, and a broad, pleasing face, set off by the\r\naddition of a well-lined nose, full intelligent eyes, a brow nicely\r\narched, and organically well-developed, and surmounted with a\r\nsuperstructure of dark, glossy hair, tinged with grey, rose to reply.\r\nMy lord, in addition to being rather shortish, possessed a countenance\r\nindicative of amiability rather than strength of mind or force of\r\ncharacter. 'Silence!' echoed and reechoed through the hall, and for a\r\nfew seconds all was still. Then the badge-bedecked figure, with\r\ndignity all sublime, rose to the order. His dark eyes wandered to to\r\nthe right and left, then over the banqueting scene, and again toward\r\nthe ladies. Smooth would here say, by way of interrupting his\r\nlordship, and for the better information of his readers, that Sir\r\nJames, becoming somewhat civilized--perhaps he should say tamed,--and\r\nmade conscious that he confronted Mr. Pierce's special minister,\r\npledged him in numerous glasses, and being now somewhat mellow, cooled\r\naway into an all-refreshing nap, during the enjoyment of which he,\r\nwith unpolished bows, made known his approbation of each happy\r\nsentiment contained in the speeches.\r\n\r\n\"His lordship (the reader must now return) here commenced drawing from\r\nthe cavities of his deep mind all the nice sayings of which his speech\r\nwas so beautifully made up. Again he paused, made several gestures\r\nwith his right hand, declared war upon all obstructing coughs,\r\nelongated his importance as never did peacock on a shingle, and\r\nproceeded: 'My lords and gentlemen!' Loud and good-natured laughing\r\nbrought his lordship suddenly to a stop. 'My lord is not in the--',\r\nwhispered Sir Matthew Moore, who sat all facetious at his lordship's\r\nright. Sir Matthew, significantly touching his lordship's elbow, while\r\ncasting a sly wink across the table, enjoined;--'Fellow citizens and\r\nladies, your lordship!' His lordship's face dispensed a few gorgeous\r\nblushes as he hesitated, and with an angular motion of the head, he\r\nconvicted another cough, and made the very best kind of a bow\r\nacknowledging the default. 'Ladies, gentlemen, fellow-citizens!'\r\ncontinued his lordship, not having altogether gained the firm footing\r\nof his equilibrium--which, however, was much relieved by sundry\r\nwell-modulated _bravos_ from the assembly--'I 'ave the 'onor' (his\r\nlordship must be pardoned for his onslaught upon the h's) 'in\r\nhappearing before this respectable body of Hamerican gentlemen hand\r\nladies!--ladies hand gentlemen! (his lordship suddenly corrected\r\nhimself), let it not be thought that I ham bestowing flattery when I\r\nsay I esteem it an 'onor which I cannot too highly characterize, and\r\nfor which I am so deeply indebted to my friend who 'as so long and\r\nnobly contributed to the durability of friendly intercourse between\r\nthe two greatest and most enlightened peoples on earth--the man whom I\r\nam compelled to view as the greatest living diplomatist of _the\r\nhage!_' Here the company, with one accord, made a bow, while Sir\r\nMatthew interrupted his lordship by whispering, 'Nicholas of All the\r\nRussias excepted!' His lordship, with a peremptory glance at Sir\r\nMatthew, the meaning of which it was not easy to mistake, continued,\r\nsomewhat testily:--'I will make no single exception for any such\r\nrenegade!' Turning to the chairman, he reminded minded him of Sir\r\nMatthew's rejoinder, which he assured him he could not consider,\r\nunless indeed he sacrificed the high functions of that great office to\r\nwhich the voice of a people true to their traditions, and Providence,\r\nhad so significantly called him at this all momentous moment--the\r\nbreaking out of an Eastern war! 'No less surprized than hoverjoyed am\r\nI to meet so _respectable looking_ an assemblage of citizens of that\r\ngreat country in the West, which we naturally view as the exponent of\r\ntrue independence, as well as our great hoffspring. Would _hi_, as\r\nthe great representative of this city, be saying too much while\r\nasserting that in my 'umble opinion no one part of this expansive\r\nhearth (great applause) could send forth so respectable and orderly an\r\nassemblage of persons.' The ladies here shouted, and waved their\r\nhandkerchiefs. Having received this distinguished compliment with due\r\ndignity, he commenced drawing aside the curtain that we might know\r\nmore of his early history, which he felt assured in his own mind could\r\nnot fail to hinterest the citizens of the United States in general,\r\nseeing that he belonged not to the 'haristocracy.' (This was received\r\nwith a perfect explosion of applause.) In the days of his youth, when\r\ngeographies were made without reference to correctness, and the study\r\nof globes was considered equal to the minds of those only who were\r\nlearned enough to raise the devil, had he been taught from one of\r\nthose imperfect pasteboards that Hamerica was an immense expanse of\r\nforests, inhabited by wild Hindians and curiously formed\r\nbarbarians. And the impression thus made, he assured Mr. Smooth in\r\nparticular, had so enrooted itself in his mind that he ever and anon\r\nfound himself most mysteriously contemplating the want of a state of\r\ncivilization in that great and glorious country. (Deafening\r\napplause). Here his lordship's animation was at the highest pressure;\r\nindeed so high was it, that a very respectable gentleman, sitting not\r\nfar from Smooth, bowed, and suggested that the little Lord Mayor must\r\nhave mistaken the present company for his dining senate. 'Now,'\r\ncontinued his worship, emphatically, 'nothing could more happily 'ave\r\naffected a change in my mind, than the beholding with my own eyes the\r\nlovely fair ones and respectable persons here present. To that great\r\ncountry, Hamerica, shall I hereafter look for the noblest results to\r\ncivilization and mankind. (Cheers). It is now nearly two 'undred years\r\nsince the foundation stone of that great republic was laid by the\r\nimmortal Washington.' His lordship's speech was again interrupted by a\r\ndemonstration of surprise on the part of the audience. He paused a\r\nmoment, as if questioning the cause. Sir Mathew's aid was again called\r\ninto service; reminding his lordship that his history was at fault, he\r\nadded, in a tone most prudent, 'Not yet one hundred, my lord; 1776\r\nmarks the date of the declaration of independence.' Thanking Sir\r\nMathew for the kindly hint, he apologized to his hearers, and\r\nproceeded. 'One hundred years, then have hardly rolled around, and we\r\nfind that wonderful country presided over by a commoner--the choice of\r\na free people, who raise him to that proud eminence once every eight\r\nyears--vieing (here Sir Mathew again interrupted by saying, 'Every\r\nfour years, my lord!') with the oldest and most powerful nations of\r\nEurope. Thanks, Sir Mathew,' interpolated his lordship, rather tartly,\r\nturning round. His Honor now proceeded for some time on a rather\r\nsmooth course, except that he left out a great many h's and put in a\r\ngreat many a's. The great minds of America, he said, had done a world\r\nfor her greatness. Here he condescended to pay what he was pleased to\r\nconsider a very deserved compliment to General Flum of New York, whose\r\nbroad and deeply wrinkled face he espied at the extreme end of one of\r\nthe long tables, where it loomed up like a careworn lantern amidst a\r\ncluster of delicately tinted foliage. America, said his lordship,\r\nsought her great men, not from among the effete walks of the\r\nharistocracy, from the more legitimate hemisphere--the common walks of\r\nlife. With a strange elongation of the body did our speaker emphasize\r\nthe remark. Great men were the gift of an age, and a nation's fortune;\r\nand with which he was more than happy to say Hamerica had been\r\nblessed--would that his conscience and love of truth would permit him\r\nto say as much of his own country! He saw the personification and\r\nembodiment of America's great minds in the countenance of his much\r\nesteemed friend General Flum, whom his very soul joyed at recognizing\r\npresent. (We will here add, by way of parenthesis, that the knowing\r\nones of New York had a less exalted opinion of Flum's talent, which\r\nhad remained hid under a pewter pot, but for General Pierce, who\r\ndragged it to the light of day for the purpose of eventually\r\nharmonizing his cabinet). Fortunate was it for the welfare of a great\r\ncountry that such men existed; they seemed born to a special purpose,\r\nwhich to him was a medium of conserving and protecting the great\r\ninternational well-being of the two peoples. That purpose was the\r\ngreatest the world could contemplate in this great age of pounds,\r\nshillings, and pence; and with such a mind as he knew General Flum\r\npossessed, and the stronger arguments with which the generous host had\r\nconciliated all differences international, the two countries were sure\r\nto continue in a bond of friendship. To this distinguished compliment\r\nour general was pleased to make an approving bow. Again, his honor, in\r\ncompliment of himself, informed those present that nothing could be\r\nmore significant of divine will than that at this momentous crisis,\r\nwhen a bloody war was on the eve of hurling its vengeance over Europe,\r\nand devastating the nations, he should be called to hadminister those\r\nhigh functions of a nation the duties of his office involved; and,\r\ntoo, when an opportunity would be afforded him of exercising those\r\nmental gifts with which God had happily and liberally endowed\r\nhim. With the full force of this valuable interposition he had not a\r\ndoubt but that the peace and harmony of the world would again be\r\nrestored. Nor should her Majesty's ministers ever ask in vain his\r\nadvice;[*] and, as to the right of impeaching them, he would\r\ntenaciously reserve that to himself on all occasions. Whenever they\r\nevinced want of hexperience, his knowledge of hintricate questions and\r\nmystifying diplomacy should always be at their disposal. A single\r\nflourish more, his face glowing earnest, and the little great man\r\nproposed (having reiterated that great men were the gift of an age!)\r\n'The great minds of America!' This inspiring sentiment he coupled with\r\nthe name of General Plum, and sat down amidst a shower of very\r\ngood-natured applause.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: His Honor recently brought forward in the Board of Aldermen\r\na resolution having for its object the impeachment of Lord\r\nAberdeen and his cabinet.]\r\n\r\n\"This compliment, as the vulgar say, took Plum all aback. He rose in\r\nall the dignity of a Pierce diplomatist; his face brightened,\r\nconscious of merit; his tall loose figure elongated; he mastered\r\nseveral very ill-positioned coughs, and with glances very\r\ncongressional, as if seeking a reportorial eye, spoke as modern\r\npoliticians mostly do when President-making. But before Smooth\r\nproceeds to transcribe the elements of his speech, some description of\r\nhis person may be necessary; in truth, he hears the reader demanding\r\nit. Flum is a long-jointed man, tall and coarse of figure, has a broad\r\ninexpressive face, with a spacious mouth and thin lips, disclosing\r\nirregular and discolored teeth; to which is added a sharp, projecting\r\nchin, prominent cheek bones, lazy grey eyes, deeply sunken under\r\nnarrow arches slightly fringed with short, sprouting, reddish hairs,\r\nand a thin high bridged nose, forming a curvature on the ridge, and\r\ntwisted to the left at an angle of some twenty-two degrees. This\r\nsingular deformity of the nasal organ arose from the fact of its\r\nhaving been in contact with the hard hand of a pugilistic congressman;\r\nat least so went report. To those exhibiting nice taste for the\r\nappearance of our political gentry, we would say that the general, not\r\nat all like Smooth, added to the beauty of his _personel_ a low,\r\nreclining forehead, superstructed with bright crispy hair, that stood\r\nconfused all over his head, and gave him the appearance of having been\r\nchased by some infuriated bull. Of the general's general estimation of\r\nhis own capacity, Smooth is sure the reader will not impose a penalty\r\nso far beyond his humble capacity as that of finding within this\r\nnarrow world of ordinary presumption anything with which to compare it\r\nsuccessfully. Having had many misfortunes in his upward career of\r\npolitical life, which was singularly marked with disappointments,\r\nnotwithstanding he had lent forcible aid in making many a President,\r\nhe never has permitted the strongest opinion of his own talent to die\r\nout from his mind; and now that that well-cultivated opinion is made\r\nstronger by the all-important verdict of his eloquent worship, how can\r\nhe resist the real proof of his being a much-neglected great man? 'Mr.\r\nChairman, and fellow citizens!' ejaculated Flum, nervously. 'My\r\nfriend, the Lord Mayor, has paid a well and much deserved compliment\r\nto our country, our country's institutions, and our country's great\r\nminds. So, far, ladies and gentlemen, as that compliment applies to\r\nmyself, I may or may not have deserved it; delicacy and reserve are\r\nalways the noblest attributes of great men. But--and with all due\r\ndeference to those accomplished gentlemen of England do I say it--it\r\nis to the democratic character of our institutions that we owe the\r\nusefulness of those great minds, as reflected in our country's\r\ngreatness. Yes ladies and gentlemen, the democracy!--'\r\n\r\n\"Here Flum was interrupted by Sam Spooner from Boston, who sat at his\r\nleft, and with a gentle touch on the arm, reminded him in a careless\r\nwhisper, that Citizen Peabody, although a very unostentatious man, was\r\nno democrat; nor was it certain the ladies would all be inclined to\r\nfather his adoption.\r\n\r\n\"Flum, somewhat nonplused, allowed a smile of endurance to invade his\r\nbroad inexpressive face, and rejoined with what he was pleased to\r\nconsider very nice wit. 'If Citizen Peabody,' said he, 'be not an\r\nindependent democrat I am exceedingly sorry for it--nothing more being\r\nrequired to make him a perfect man!' At this the company set up one of\r\nthe very best-natured laughs ever rung out of human organs. Flum, not\r\ncomprehending its meaning, continued, ere it had subsided--'I hold\r\nnothing more imperative than that our generous host, Citizen Peabody,\r\nshould at once declare his intention of not only becoming a round,\r\nsound democrat, but joining the Young American party; which will in\r\ntruth be a more forcible proof of the purely democratic spirit of that\r\ndiplomacy he has so worthily founded, and which can now claim so many\r\nhappy results as its offspring. No system of diplomacy heretofore\r\nestablished has been so redolent of influences tending to strengthen\r\nthe bonds of international amity; for, indeed, meats and drinks are\r\nall-powerful.' Here some indifference was manifested on the part of\r\nthe English aristocracy present, which, causing a momentary suspension\r\nof the speech, produced a very unexpected calm, much to the\r\nastonishment of Flum's own dear self. 'Well, I apprehends the gist\r\non't--democracy don't go down, no way, this side the big pond. But, if\r\nJohn is old, and has got his noddle so full of antiquated nonsense\r\nthat he can't get an idea into his head suited to the exigencies of\r\nthe times, democracy, with its all-elevating power, will stand by him,\r\ngive him new sinners to sustain himself, and carry him through those\r\nstruggles aristocracy has not nerve to surmount.' (Cheers). Having\r\nliterally illustrated every beauty to which democracy was heir, wasted\r\nseveral well-constructed and not badly directed compliments on General\r\nPierce's patriotism, called upon those present to come boldly out and\r\nimitate Young America in all his go-ahead proficiencies, Flum turned\r\nto his worship, on which wonderful embodiment of statesmanship and\r\nexperience he intended to return the compliments that functionary had\r\nso flatteringly bestowed. As disappointments will occur, even with the\r\ngreatest of men, so did Flum find himself totally inadequate to the\r\ndischarge of this duty. There was, however, a responsibility resting\r\nupon him, which he must, considering that it touched that which was an\r\nhonor to England and the English nation, discharge. It was, that he\r\nhad to congratulate old England on the possession of such men as his\r\nWorship--men born to the exigencies of an age, and in whose charge the\r\ndistracted affairs of Europe, now threatening the peace of nations,\r\nwould be sure to find a satisfactory solution. Here his honor made a\r\nmost appropriate bow in acknowledgment, while a few gentlemen, rather\r\nloquaciously disposed, smiled and Miss Mapplebank, from Arkansas,\r\ncovered her face with her white handkerchief. It was evident to all\r\npresent that the two greatest men of the two greatest countries had\r\nmet on a great international platform (the banqueting table), and as\r\nthe exchange of verdicts upon the capacity of each other only served\r\nto make stronger the opinion they had always entertained of\r\nthemselves, everyone present was ready to throw up his or her hat in\r\ncompliment of a discovery which must reflect to the great good of\r\nnations in general. Flum ended his speech, the mediums had met;\r\ninternational unity was perfect. Mr. Peabody bowed, the great men\r\nsignified their acknowledgment, the company rose as the general made\r\nhis last flourish and wiped the sweat from his brow, and all adjourned\r\nin the very happiest phase of good humor. Smooth being somewhat\r\nmodest, and always bashful when in the presence of ladies, did not\r\nmake his speech until they had left. It may be well to say that\r\nMr. Smooth's speech was gracefully responded to by Citizen Peabody,\r\nwho expressed himself delighted, and had no doubt but that in the care\r\nof Mr. Smooth, General Pierce would make an unexceptional President.\r\nAfter this, gentlemen feeling very jolly, we all adjourned to the\r\ngorgeously furnished hall up stairs, where we joined the ladies,\r\npartook of most delicious coffee, enjoyed many happy salutations and\r\ncordial greetings. The Lord Mayor and Flum having embraced in style\r\ntruly Roman, and pledged themselves over a cup of coffee, never to\r\nlose sight of their own greatness, nor to forget the beneficence of\r\nthat all-wise Providence that had called them into being to struggle\r\nwith the great events of the age, the company dispersed homeward,\r\ndelighted to the very heart. If there was one who did not feel a glow\r\nof satisfaction, admonishing him, as he wended his way homeward, to\r\nlend his influence for the maintenance of that mutual good feeling\r\nwhich should exist between Englishmen and Americans--between nations\r\nso kindred in spirit, and whose interests radiated from a common\r\ncentre, he must have belonged to a class Smooth would not deign to\r\ndesignate. Citizen George would that England and America shook hands,\r\nremained friends, and left the gunpowder and big-word business\r\nentirely to newspapers and small politicians of the Pierce stamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSMOOTH LOOKS IN UPON THE MIXED COMMISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President Pierce, who was by his friends supposed to be a comical\r\nand very small miniature of General Jackson's political school, and\r\nwhose cabinet was of the Bunkum stripe, intimated to Minister Smooth,\r\nin one of the interviews he had with him, which were numerous and very\r\nconfidential, that in his tour over Europe it might prove profitable\r\nto the country in general were he to keep a sharp eye on the movements\r\nof a very respectable firm which did business under the name and in\r\nthe style of Soule, Saunders, and Co.--funny functionaries, who were\r\nnow cutting figure No. 1, and expecting him (the man Pierce) to cut\r\nthe smaller figure No. 2. No one personally acquainted with the merits\r\nof the aforesaid gentlemen would be surprised to hear that they had\r\nthreatened kingdoms, emperors, and kings, astonished peoples, and\r\ngiven deluded individuals wonderful opinions of that country which\r\ncould send such embodiments of its wisdom and spirits to their\r\naid. Indeed, Smooth found himself, while in Europe, made an exception\r\nto the generality of Mr. Pierce's diplomatists, whom, it was generally\r\nadmitted, had either shown spunk or turned gentlemen fighters to no\r\naccount. It mattered not how much these strange sprigs of capricious\r\nYoung America misrepresented American manners, education, and\r\nsentiments; no, to revolutionary spirits of the _real-red order_ were\r\nthey the all-great of America's bone and soul. But let us not arouse\r\nthe gods by recounting their many follies; the generous soul of\r\nAmerica has indeed been compelled by them to father many an\r\nextravagance; and, too, though more modest, had not Mr. Pierce\r\ndelegated extensive powers to the Tomkin's family for the very\r\nharmless purpose of transacting over the world such business as old\r\nSam had several times declared unnecessary, and which was in\r\nopposition to the interests of the nation, the said Sam being expected\r\nto pay all the shot. Pierce said Smooth must keep an eye practically\r\nto windward in reference to the business this species of gentry were\r\nsent to perform. Hence, acting from principle, which was Smooth's\r\nmotto, and with a full knowledge that Sam was curiously good-natured,\r\nhad broad and ever open pockets to accommodate that worthy\r\ncharacteristic, which no one thought it any harm to relieve, he gave\r\nhis (Smooth's) assurance that the charge of neglect never should be\r\nlaid at his door--that he would watch the Tomkinses! To deny the\r\nexistence of a singular prompting to kill time over aught that Sam\r\nstood sponsor for, was a very good-natured absurdity; few indeed could\r\nbe found who did not consider him an old foodle, who had fathered more\r\nexpensive abortions than any other individual, and was willing to\r\nfather more. How, then, could Mr. Pierce help viewing with suspicion\r\nthe performances of those tool-grinders he had sent abroad! The amount\r\nof kitchen labor he had himself performed and the number of times he\r\nhad laid on the grindstone to the turning of his man Fourney, formed\r\nno excuse; forsooth, it enabled him the more clearly to comprehend the\r\nins and outs of this wholesale style of coming possum over poor old\r\nSam, whose credulity was only surpassed by that fatherly old\r\ngentleman, Mr. John Bull, whom millions love to live upon, and spend\r\ntheir lives in getting out his affections and his purse.\r\n\r\n\"Now John and Jonathan had for many years amused one another with the\r\nlong-drawn music of diplomacy, played on very expensive keys, made\r\nwith the express view of settling all ungrateful international\r\ngrowlings. Diplomacy, nevertheless, found these growlings beyond its\r\npower to reconcile; and now, having worn out its pipe over them, they\r\nwere shuffled off upon the genius of a mixed commission, which high\r\nconvention was expected to exert common sense and forego etiquette,\r\nand result in a mutual settlement of all outstanding questions since\r\n1812. But, by a mysterious process, which never fails of effect in\r\nsuch cases, a deal of time had been unprofitably consumed by this\r\nsupposed immaculate commission. And now the high contracting parties\r\nsought an extension, that much more might be consumed in the very same\r\nway. Uncle Sam being very good-natured, the request could not be\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\n\"Through the Strand to Wellington street, Mister Smooth wended his\r\nway, and soon found himself between rows of high and stately\r\nbuildings, in one of which, all calm and easy, sat the convention.\r\nEntering a narrow arch to the right, he passed down a passage so\r\nintricate and dark that it had the appearance of leading to a cave,\r\nand in a few minutes was confronted by a polite attendant, who ushered\r\nhim into the presence of the international dignitaries, then sitting\r\nround a large square table, in the centre of the room, in moody\r\ncontemplation. The room was high of ceiling, about twenty-five by\r\neighteen feet in dimensions, and in appearance very well adapted to\r\nthe pursuit of knowledge, for the display of legal ability. Upon the\r\ntable, which seemed somewhat infirm, lay in excellent disorder, a few\r\nmassive books, two green bags, a jacknife, Murray's Grammar, Walker's\r\nlargest Dictionary, four large pipes, an ample supply of fine-cut\r\ntobacco, and sundry very bad writing materials. In one corner of the\r\nroom spread out a green screen, behind which was various simple but\r\nvery useful ware; this, together with two extra chairs for strangers,\r\nstanding at the other corner, constituted the furniture. There was a\r\nstrong legal air about the table, notwithstanding its promiscuous\r\nburden. At the head of it sat like Cicero--but he had none of Cicero's\r\ngenius in his soul!--a man moody of countenance and portly of person:\r\nhe was called the Umpire, and they said he was chosen because of his\r\nbirthplace being America. Some had gone so far as to characterize the\r\nchoice an evidence that Mr. Bull was inclined to act upon the square,\r\nand permit Cousin Jonathan to have it all his own way,--never for once\r\nkeeping in mind that it mattered but little where a man's birthplace\r\nwas, if he had long since forgotten the spirit of its institutions.\r\nIndeed, as far as sympathy and manners are concerned, an American may\r\nbe more than an Englishman, and _vice versa_. Smooth does not mean to\r\ninsinuate that the case is illustrated in the present functionary,\r\nwhose face was of that stern cast which at times would lead to believe\r\nit unhappy under the fatigue of a too solid body. To this singularly\r\nstern face was added a nose, facetious gentlemen might be inclined to\r\ncall the ripening fruits of good wine, while pervading all was an air\r\nof sordidness curiously at variance with the good parts repute\r\nasserted he possessed. Smooth would have taken him for a man whose\r\nmind was of a mechanical turn; for at times he would become dreamy,\r\nhis eyes would close within leaden lids, and his body seem prone to\r\ncool away into sleep's gentlest embrace. Again he would, as if with\r\nmuch effort, raise those leaden eyelids, draw forth a languid breath,\r\nstretch his arms athwart, and, as if 'twere pain, listen to the legal\r\nlogic boring its dryness into his very soul. The tax did indeed seem\r\nbeyond his power of endurance.\r\n\r\n\"Being introduced all round, Smooth commenced the conversation by\r\nsaying, in a warm and good-natured sort of way:--'Well, Citizens!--how\r\ndo ye make out to get time over the bank? S'pose it's because Uncle\r\nSam stands at the gangway serving the shot?' They did not seem to\r\nbrighten up at this remark. It was evidently viewed as rather out of\r\nplace; for the Umpire quickened his nodding, and the other five\r\nfunctionaries constituting the convention permitted their faces to\r\nyield looks by no means significant of good-nature. Quoth, by the way\r\nof conventionality, were they right glad to see Minister Smooth;\r\nfurther, they shook him warmly by the hand, and made many inquiries\r\nabout Pierce and his policy--a thing he never had, hence the\r\nimpossibility of enlightening them. Mr. Pierce had an eye to Cuba, but\r\nno policy whatever with regard to the getting of it: in addition to\r\nthis, Pierce himself so far defied analyzation that many grave and\r\nexperienced diplomatists had declared the problem beyond their power\r\nto solve.\r\n\r\n\"Again, our grave conventionists said they had heard it whispered that\r\nMinister Smooth (generally called Solomon Smooth, Esq.), being special\r\nMinister of Mr. General Pierce to nowhere in particular, had secret\r\ninstructions to arrange matters for the holding of an extraordinary\r\nconvention at Ostend; which said convention, being principally\r\ncomposed of very respectable foreign gentlemen, would especially take\r\ninto consideration the Cuba question, as also the deciding the point\r\nas to whether the Spanish spirit of the people of that island would\r\ndetract from the national purity of Americanism. In the event of Cuba\r\nforming an integral part of the federal compact, a grave question\r\nwould here be involved. Assuring them they were not wrong in their\r\nconjectures, Smooth was invited to sit down, in a very honorary\r\nposition, where, having examined certain papers pertaining to previous\r\nproceedings, and passed an undivided approval upon them, he remained\r\nin all his dignity, listening with great legal seriousness to the very\r\nimportant case then being argued by General F----, whose eloquence was\r\nof the 'rip-roarer' style, and whose tragical flourishes were as\r\nterrific as dangerous to the limbs all persons in proximity. Smooth's\r\nseat was at the left of the Umpire, that functionary's right being\r\nflanked by a gentleman lean of figure and studious of countenance,\r\nsaid to be the American Commissioner, a worthy person of great legal\r\nabilities. A little below Smooth sat the compact figure of a man in a\r\ngenteel garb; an air of amiability sat on his countenance, which ever\r\nand anon seemed playful; indeed, the very soul of geniality darted\r\nfrom a pair of large blue eyes that gave great softness to an oval\r\nface, nicely outlined in its parts. In a word, he was what might be\r\ncalled a very promising limb of the modernly honorable law profession;\r\nnor would our opinion of him have been less exalted had he refrained\r\nfrom the very innocent sport of amusing himself with blowing peas\r\nthrough a quill, which he did in all the playfulness of youth, his\r\nhead being level with the surface of the table the while. We had never\r\nsupposed him the British Commissioner but for the assurance of those\r\nin possession of stronger proof than we had been permitted to see. A\r\nlittle below him, and with seeming indifference to the arguments of\r\nwhich General F---- was relieving his mind, sat a sharp-featured man,\r\nwhose lithe figure, clear complexion, quick gray eyes, finely arched\r\neyebrows, well-developed brow, and head, superstructured with a\r\nprofusion of light Saxon hair, that hung soft and smooth down his\r\nneck, an even cut mouth, with thin lips, slightly turned, and\r\ndisclosing teeth of great regularity and pearly whiteness,--a nose\r\nhigh, sharp, and strictly Grecian, gave him a personel of more than\r\nordinary attractions. Smooth apprehends the reader will not charge him\r\nwith a diversion when he says that any lady of taste might have become\r\nenamored of this gentleman without for a moment subjecting herself to\r\nthe charge of stupidity. Queen Victoria might, indeed, claim for\r\nherself the merit of having done a pretty thing for Cousin Jonathan;\r\nfor the two pretty gentlemen she had chosen to represent her in the\r\nmixed commission bespoke how much she had regarded the value of\r\npersonal beauty in the settlement of those claims, so long\r\noutstanding, and so beset with grave difficulties. Notwithstanding all\r\nthis, the last gentleman was said to be young, but a clever lawyer.\r\nNow a play of the humorous invaded his face; and while from his eye\r\nthere came out a strong love of the ludicrous, a curl of sarcasm now\r\nand then ruffled his lip. They called him the British agent--in other\r\nwords, the Counsel for Her Most Gracious Majesty. Smooth had no\r\nstronger evidence of this fact than that the gentleman seemed very\r\ncontented with the way time went, amusing himself with making paper\r\nspy-glasses,[*] with which he quizzed objects on the floor, then took\r\nlunar observations through it, the broad disc of the Umpire's red face\r\naffording the medium of a planet. To General F----, who was then in the\r\nfull pressure of his speech, making his, to him, crushing arguments a\r\nlegal treadmill for his handsome brother, he seemed a perfect pest,\r\ninasmuch as whenever the General had got a real stunner of an argument\r\non the crook of his mind, and just where he would be sure to lose it\r\nif the course were not left clear, he was sure to interrupt him with\r\nsome annoying question, which in most cases amounted to nothing less\r\nthan disputing the premises assumed. The General had not received\r\nthese interruptions with so much perturbation but that they were\r\nalways coupled with a sarcastic leer, the significance of which had\r\nnot been well directed, nor should ever be indulged in by legal\r\nbrethren engaged in the settlement of grave international\r\nquestions. The reader may say:--'who so cruel as to begrudge the legal\r\ngentry their little innocent sport!' As the British Cabinet is at\r\ntimes a sort of toy, with which the facetious House of Commons loves\r\nto play the game of knockdown (just for the fun of seeing how much\r\ntrouble it costs the nation to build it up) so the good-natured\r\ngentlemen of this mixed commission seemed to view the gravest\r\ninternational questions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The writer here describes what he saw, without any attempt at\r\nridicule.]\r\n\r\n\"'I reiterate!' continued General Flum, for it was no less a personage\r\nthan he who poured out his eloquence to the Convention: 'If the\r\ngentleman for t'other side of this question was only to read Kent's\r\nCommentaries, or take a peep into one Story's pleadings, 'twould do\r\nhim more good nor all (we quote verbatim) the stale law he's larned in\r\nthe Inner Temple--'twould!' Here Flum paused, and majestically turned\r\nround, as if to see how his antagonist felt. His legal brother was\r\nvery quietly pursuing his lunars with the paper tube, expecting soon\r\nto work up all the curious angles of the Umpire's face. To properly\r\nintersperse this amusement he would now and then bestow a good-natured\r\nand very sly wink upon a wag who sat at the opposite side of the\r\ntable, ever and anon tickling with the feather of his quill the nasal\r\norgan of the Secretary, who had just melowed away into a delicious\r\nnap. Flum proceeded: 'I mean no disrespect to the proficiency, or to\r\nthe very high position which my learned brother holds in this\r\nConvention; but what will be said by the two governments when it is\r\nfound that among the great array of cases brought before this high\r\ntribunal so few have been settled without a reference to the Umpire? I\r\nsincerely believe that did Her Majesty's Councillor exhibit more\r\nreadiness to meet our demands with a liberal and becoming spirit, many\r\nof the cases which have passed before this high tribunal might have\r\nbeen settled with little consumption of time, and at small cost to the\r\nnation. I know General Pierce won't like the way things are done here,\r\nand how can I doubt, seeing the distinguished person present who\r\nrepresents him in the capacity of special Minister (here Smooth\r\nacknowledged the compliment by making one of his very best bows), that\r\nhe will be made acquainted with the facts.' The Umpire, his\r\ncountenance quickening, would inform gentlemen that the many\r\npersonalities and invidious references he had so often heard reminded\r\nhim rather of the pettifoggers of a police-court than the high\r\nrepresentatives of two great governments, met for the purpose of\r\ndispassionately discussing the merits of grave international\r\nquestions. He had become wearied over such a useless waste of time,\r\nhad purchased a whole library of law books (which he hoped never\r\nhereafter to have occasion to use), and must content himself with\r\nhonor for his recompense. Now he was willing to submit to the world\r\nwhether there could be any honor conferred upon him by sitting from\r\nday to day, listening, at the same time using every effort to keep\r\nawake, to the legal _cross-shots_ of gentlemen not inclined to agree\r\nto anything. The Umpire ended in a voice deep and musical, drew\r\nhimself again into his attitude of contemplation, and like an Egyptian\r\nSphinx seemed gravely studious with himself.\r\n\r\n\"The American Commissioner approved of all that had fallen from the\r\nlips of the honorable gentleman. So did the English Commissioner, who\r\nsuspended his little amusement of the quill and the peas, and\r\ncommenced examining the pages of his Vattel. Having laid aside the\r\npaper spyglass, our English agent rose quickly to his feet, and with\r\neyes darting legal tenacity, said he had a few remarks to make in\r\nreply to what he considered had very improperly fallen from the lips\r\nof his legal brother. He did not intend disrespect to the very\r\nhonorable Umpire, nor the gentlemen Commissioners, when he said that\r\nthe rules on which the business of the Commission had been conducted\r\nseemed to him to be a complete mumble, growing deeper and deeper with\r\ndifficulties. Language had been used in that forum which would be more\r\ngenially localized in Whitechapel, Drury Lane, St. Giles's, or the\r\nSurrey Side: he was sorry to see his transatlantic brother so familiar\r\nwith the piquant jargon of those atmospheres it were well not to be\r\ntoo familiar with.\r\n\r\n\"'May it please the Umpire, I ask the protection of this tribunal from\r\nany such imputation as the gentleman's insinuation would leave me\r\nunder,' said the General, almost bursting of anger.\r\n\r\n\"There seemed to be a nice little difficulty brewing, which threatened\r\na readier dispatch of business than that which had marked their\r\nefforts in the settlement of claims outstanding. Here again the\r\nUmpire, with the aid of his two Commissioners, interposed for the\r\npeace and respectability of Mr. Pierce's family. And here Mr. Smooth\r\nis happy beyond his power of expression to state, that after a very\r\nfew unmeaning explanations, the gentlemen Councillors bowed politely\r\nto each other, laughed with buffoonish good-nature, nor seemed a whit\r\nless than the very best of friends. 'If General--will proceed with his\r\nargument!' said the Umpire, gravely, by way of what writers call\r\nparenthesis. 'Then, to the point of this case: now, ye see, the law on\r\nour side of the water aint a bit like it is here, on this; 'specially\r\nwith cases of this kind. This is the case of a vessel with niggers on\r\nboard, bound from one part of the United States to t'other, but driven\r\nby what sailors call stress of weather into a British port called\r\nBermuda, where the natives (report says they are not very\r\nenlightened), not having the fear of God before their eyes, nor\r\nunderstanding the constitution of the United States, nor comprehending\r\nthe principle by which certain democratic States in the free American\r\nUnion make good property of such things as men, did regardless of the\r\nlaws of those States, insult the sovereign flag, which was alike the\r\nprotection of property and citizen, no matter in what part of the\r\nworld it floated, and set all the niggers free! After consuming an\r\nhour in arguments of this stamp, the General claimed to have made out\r\nhis case, inasmuch as the niggers being property to the laws of the\r\nStates to which they belonged, and the flag of the United States being\r\nabsolute in its character of a protection,--no matter under what local\r\njurisdiction,--the claim against England for compensation was as just\r\nan one as ever man could present for man; did she withhold payment, it\r\nmust be at her peril.'\r\n\r\n\"His legal brother now rose, a good-natured smile playing over his\r\nsharp face. Before commencing, he would say he wished his learned\r\nbrother had taken a more dispassionate view of the case, and laid down\r\na basis of broader principles. Much of the difficulty in settling the\r\nmany claims that had been presented for adjudication arose from the\r\nfact of his learned brother laying down rules to suit his own case,\r\nwhich he would not admit when applied against him. Further, he had not\r\nthe most faint idea of the nigger question being dragged before this\r\ntribunal for adjudication. He had hoped that that question might be\r\nleft for settlement on the soil of America, where those best\r\nacquainted with the evil could most readily find a remedy. But if it\r\nwere true that the flag was inviolable, and that such was held as law,\r\nand regarded in good faith by the federal government of the United\r\nStates, how came it that certain States in the federal compact so far\r\ndisregarded the rule as to scoff at the idea of the flag being\r\nsuperior to the municipal regulations of the port; invade the decks of\r\nBritish vessels, regardless of the flag; and drag from beneath its\r\nfolds British citizens, whom they incarcerated and made criminals\r\nmerely to suit the caprices of a municipal statute? Strange indeed was\r\nit for a nation great as was the American to lay down a principle of\r\nforeign policy the action of which could only be allowed when it\r\nsuited the immediate interests of that nation, and was rejected when\r\nit came in collision with them. He would tell the learned\r\nrepresentative of that nation, that the spirit manifested in such a\r\ncourse to him 'seemed more to comport with that specious style of\r\nconducting business better understood among hucksters!' Here the man\r\nof the American side of the house evinced some excitement, and quickly\r\nrising to his feet, said he would not stand silently by and hear such\r\nimputations cast upon his house, country, and people. The judiciary of\r\nthe United States could not be impugned--none was purer; while the\r\nforeign policy of the United States stood out a model for the nations\r\nof Europe to pattern from. A counter interruption again took\r\nplace. The Umpire drew a long breath; the good-looking English\r\nCommissioner heaved a sigh, and again commenced amusing himself with\r\nthe quill; the sedate American Commissioner yawned, and turned\r\ncontemplatively the leaves of a commentary; to end, they all seemed\r\nseized with the yawning fever, which was kept up until they laughed\r\nright earnestly at one another, the handsome gentleman stretching his\r\narms athwart, and making a hideous grimace. At length this state of\r\nthings was put an end to by the Umpire, who did hope gentlemen would\r\nsee, in his dinner hour having arrived, the necessity of either\r\nresting the arguments here, or postponing them for another day.\r\n\r\n\"In rejoining, her Majesty's sharp featured Councillor having\r\npronounced a high eulogium on his Honor's power of endurance, and the\r\nonerous duties imposed upon him by the Governments which he so nobly\r\nsought to serve, and from whom the mere honor afforded but a meagre\r\ncompensation, (inasmuch as he felt convinced the proverbial\r\ningratitude of Governments would be carried out in their not even\r\ncompensating him for the large outlay he had been constrained to make\r\nin law books) hoped he might be permitted to make a few more remarks.\r\nHis honor bowing assent, the well-looking legal gentleman, in blandest\r\naccents, proceeded to say Jonathan must not lay a foundation for\r\nothers he was first to knock down; for if a rule applied to great\r\nprinciples it must not be made subservient to small exigencies of an\r\nopposite character: Jonathan must bow to his own stumbling-blocks. It\r\ndid, however, seem that this Commission had been viewed by certain\r\nparties as a sort of _ola podra_; before which deluded persons thought\r\nnothing more certain than that their manifold grievances would be\r\npatiently heard, their claims find a ready settlement, and their\r\nfamily affairs all be handsomely arranged. There had been men from the\r\ncoast of Africa seeking a protection under cousin Jonathan's wing, by\r\nwhich their demands on Old John were to them certain of being paid.\r\nThere were good men from Manchester, who, forgetting their\r\nanti-slavery sentiment's, sought a relationship with our noble cousin\r\nwhich dated from previous to 1812, and under the shadow of his wings\r\nnow sought to make the rascally Britishers pay for certain slaves\r\nfrittered away from them while residing in Georgia, during the last\r\nwar. There too, were noble Dukes and Earls presenting claims against\r\nour cousin for certain lands in Florida, presented long since to them\r\nby some imbecile king, who would upon the same style of conditions,\r\nhave given away the whole Continent. The said gentlemen had long since\r\nforgotten the titles, and were only reminded of them by the existence\r\nof this Commission. English gentlemen from Mexico sought, through the\r\nvirtues of this Commission, pay for property appropriated by General\r\nScott during the Mexican war. Pensionless widows thought it the grand\r\ncentre of generosity, and sought through it compensation for dead\r\nhusbands. Holders of Mississippi bonds regarded it a perfect El\r\nDorado, at the shrine of which those long repudiated mementoes would\r\nbe duly paid, hopes and angry passions requited, and old Mississippi\r\nherself again, as bright as a new-coined Jackson cent: and last, but\r\nnot least, gentlemen with very credulous and speculative faculties,\r\nand who held the most doubtful species of Florida bonds, had made\r\ntheir hearts glad on the certain payment of them by the Commission.\r\n'In a word,' said the learned Councillor, 'nothing can be more certain\r\nto my mind (and I am borne out in the belief by the variety and\r\ncharacter of the claims presented to this Commission) than that the\r\nwhole world is beginning to look on our worthy transatlantic cousin as\r\nthe most generous, if not the most credulous, fellow extant! Whether\r\nhis model friend George Saunders, can take to himself any merit for\r\nhaving created this now very general opinion in Europe (by virtue of\r\nhis most extraordinary circulars), Smooth is unable to decide; but\r\ncertain is it that every disaffected subject on the continent who can\r\nget up spleen enough to fancy himself a much injured republican--'\r\nHere General F---- interrupted, by submitting to the honorable Umpire\r\nwhether these remarks were not gratuitous, irrelevant, and\r\nimproper. The Umpire, having given his opinion that they were unduly\r\nlong (extending a whole hour beyond his dinner-time), begged the\r\ngentleman would turn the key to his concluding remarks. 'I have only\r\nanother remark to make,' rejoined the gentleman with the sharp face:\r\n'If Sydney Smith had lived, there would have been more wit and sarcasm\r\nlevelled at this mixed Commission than would have filled an octavo\r\nvolume. I cannot forbear to say, however, that strange as is the\r\ncharacter of many of these demands, claims, and grievances, some of\r\nthem might have been settled without such a deplorable waste of time,\r\nhad it not been for the interference of that phantom devil,\r\nMr. General Pierce's black pig, who is always construing principles to\r\nsuit his purposes. So avaricious is that animal, that no amount of\r\nswill seems to pacify his desire to overthrow principles and defeat\r\ngreat objects. No place would seem too obscure for the brute to get\r\nhis nose into; no demands too egregious for his appetite; no rights\r\ntoo daintily established for his disregard. He is here, there, and\r\neverywhere--demanding with the same ferocious spirit. We had hoped\r\nMr. General Pierce would keep him at home during the deliberations of\r\nthis Convention: let us console our disappointment by trusting to what\r\nthe future may bring forth.' Here the Umpire's patience was at an\r\nend--patience no longer remained with him a virtue. He rose moodily\r\nfrom his seat, said the sitting would adjourn until to-morrow,\r\nand betook himself to his dinner, which he added he feared would get\r\nas cold as the gentlemen's pleas. This was rather abruptly bringing\r\nmatters to a close. The legal gentlemen, as if disturbed elsewhere\r\nthan in their thoughts, looked terror-stricken, packed up their law\r\ntools, shouldered their green bags, and, in the company of Mr. Smooth,\r\nsought a place whereat to bestow good care on the inner temple.\r\nSmooth, with all deference to the opinions of the very respectable\r\ngentlemen of the mixed Commission, begs to inform his readers, and Mr.\r\nPierce in particular, that they never will catch him looking in upon\r\nthem again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nSMOOTH RECEIVES THE DOCUMENTS, AND CALLS A CONGRESS AT OSTEND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Several months having passed, during which no further instructions\r\nfrom the General came to hand, I began to think he had forgotten my\r\nmission, and taken himself to dieting on gunpowder and War-Messages\r\nfor the next Congress. Then I received a private note from his boy\r\nCaleb, in which he stated very confidentially that everything was\r\nwaiting the next turn in the Brigadier's mind. Caleb's letter\r\ndiscovered much impatience with his position, and a good many sly\r\nremarks which were intended as a hit at Marcy and his budget. I should\r\ntell the reader that an additional cause of my anxiety was the not\r\nreceiving a reply to a private and confidential note to Pierce, in\r\nwhich I remonstrated with him against the propriety of holding a thing\r\nso open to base ridicule as a Congress of American Ministers at\r\nOstend. That fraternity of infallibility, kings and princes, might\r\nbecome somewhat uneasy at its presence, many honest-hearted\r\nrepublicans would be deceived, and its result be only the illustration\r\nof an unprecedented amount of folly on the part of the American\r\nExecutive. But the thing was a great pet with Caleb, Jeff, and Pierce,\r\nwho knew that Marcy would have to father the abortions, which were\r\ngenerally laid at his door. With all these very natural difficulties\r\nbefore me, I decided to charter the next Collins steamer, and proceed\r\nto the White House, there to learn in person what the boys were doing.\r\nI was anxious to know what had become of Pierce and Papa--whether Papa\r\nwas yet administering the pap-spoon to the General, by way merely of\r\ncounteracting the effect of the charcoal being _piled on_ by the\r\nboys--Jeff and Caleb. Now, lest there should be any one in Washington\r\nunwilling to separate Smooth's better inclinations from the general\r\ncharacter of the Convention to be holden, he would here say that the\r\nvery best of his abilities were exerted with the General against the\r\npolicy of making his Ministers cut so ridiculous a figure in\r\nEurope. He knew also that Monsieur Souley would take upon himself all\r\nthe cooking business, and have it all his own way, as they say in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\"One morning, while consoling myself with the prospect of soon leaving\r\nEurope, its aristocracy, its blighting kingcraft, and its squabbles,\r\nwho should confront me but grandfather Steady, a monster despatch\r\nunder his arm, on which loomed out in all its scarlet the great seal\r\nof the State Department. Steady had recognized '_Confidential_' on the\r\nenvelope, and bore it to me safely ensconced beneath the ample skirts\r\nof his coat. 'Something of great importance for Minister Smooth!' said\r\nhe, making a very diplomatic bow as he extended the packet, made his\r\ncompliments, and retired. Steady having disappeared, I opened the\r\npacket, and, equally surprised with the reader, what should I find but\r\na State document of great dimensions, commissioning Smooth without\r\nfurther delay to call together at Ostend, or such other place on the\r\ncontinent of Europe as was celebrated for its pure air and good\r\nliquors, a Congress of American Ministers! Three several times did the\r\ncommission reiterate--'Pure air and good liquors!' as if the tastes of\r\nthe very respectable gentlemen forming the Congress made such adjuncts\r\ninseparable from the prime object of their deliberations. For some\r\ntime did I exert my most mature deliberations to get the diplomacy of\r\nthe thing square into my head, which I thought was more than had been\r\ndone by the State Department. Well, you better believe it was a\r\npuzzle! It was so Dutch, as we say. I was directed particularly to\r\nconsult my old and much-tried friend, James Buckhanan, whose sanction\r\nand presence at the gathering was necessary, as well for the purpose\r\nof imparting an air of dignity to the Convention as counteracting the\r\nfast spirit of those gentlemen, who had gained a doubtful notoriety\r\nthrough their extensive dealings in cheap popularity. Marcy added, in\r\na private and confidential note, that he felt inclined to question the\r\npolicy of inviting certain gentlemen, but as a matter of etiquette it\r\ncould not be foregone; and then he was anxious to keep peace in the\r\nhouse, I was ordered to bag Buckhanan, and, if against his will, carry\r\nhim captive; to summon Monsieur Souley, who was an excellent cook, not\r\na bad fighting man, but a diplomatist fit only for the small work of\r\nthe _carbonari;_ to dispatch Mason, who they said was cultivating his\r\nFrench, with the hope of being up in the language of diplomacy in the\r\ncourse of six years more; to enjoin Mr. Fay, well known in\r\nSwitzerland for his love of quiet life; to inveigle Mr. Belmont, who\r\nat the Hague had taken upon himself the reforming his brother\r\nIsraelites, and turning to account sundry Dutch bonds; to do as I\r\npleased with Mr. Daniels, who had sustained the character of America\r\nby affecting contempt for all the aristocratic snobs about Turin, who\r\nwould to his annoyance crowd themselves into his opera-box, and make\r\ntoo free with his fair favorite; to be sure and capture Mr. Jackson,\r\nthrough whose courteous and dignified demeanor America was making\r\nherself respected at Vienna; to send an escort for Mr. Spence, who had\r\nendeared himself to his fellow-countrymen in Constantinople; and to\r\nsend a jackass for Mister O'Sullivan, who had at Lisbon become\r\ncelebrated for his misfortunes at bagatelle and chess--to drum them\r\nall together for the one grand object. As for Seymour, Pierce thought\r\nit not good policy to disturb him, seeing that nothing had been heard\r\nfrom him since he found his way to St. Petersburg. With such spirits\r\nas these, Europe could not fail to be astonished; and then, when it\r\nwas borne in mind that the consideration of its distracted affairs was\r\nthe object No. I of such a Convention!\r\n\r\n\"While calmly cogitating the first and last move in the getting up of\r\nthe thing, my lodgings, '42, Bennet street, St. James's,' were invaded\r\nby the man Dudley, who declared himself a special minister of\r\nMr. Pierce, who sent him as envoy in general to Mr. Smooth, under\r\nwhose directions he would proceed to get together the Congress at\r\nOstend. I examined his credentials carefully, and finding them of Mr.\r\nPierce's legitimate stripe, commenced comparing notes and arranging\r\nthe preliminaries. He said, Pierce told him I would have a hard tug\r\nwith old Buck, who was like an aged turtle, and never moved until a\r\ngreat deal of fire was applied to his back: but then his friends said\r\nhe was fast, once he got going! Notwithstanding Buck had very\r\nconfidently told a friend or two there was no understanding Pierce,\r\nPierce said he understood him, and, with Saunders to lend a hand, the\r\ngetting steam on him would not be so much of a job, after all. I must\r\nhere say to the reader that we had not long proceeded with our\r\nconversation before the fact that our man Dudley was commissioned to\r\nplay the part of Corporal Noggs to the fire-eating portion of the\r\nCabinet, at the small end of which Mister Pierce was appended,\r\ndiscovered itself. This fact fully established, I sat down and\r\ncommissioned him, first--to keep his mouth shut; secondly, to proceed\r\nimmediately to the Continent and get together the boys; thirdly, to\r\nenjoin upon every one the necessity of declaring the object of the\r\nConvention to be the relief of mankind in general; and fourthly, to be\r\ncareful while in France that none of Consul Saunders' _epistles to all\r\noppressed citizens_ were found in his pocket,--that functionary being\r\nheld as the great revolutionary star, sent from the West to move the\r\ndead waters of an Eastern world.\r\n\r\n\"Having dispatched the man Dudley on his mission, with many bows and\r\nmuch esteem for his high consideration of my position, and acting on\r\nthe intimation from Pierce, I packed up my portfolio, and in a Hansom\r\ncab made the best of my way to 56, Harley street,--a large mansion, in\r\none of the back rooms of which they said my esteemed friend James\r\nBuckhanan had for some time past been burrowed. That is, Mrs. Sprat,\r\nwho knew all the gossip of the legation, declared such to be the\r\nfact. She saw very little indeed of the 'Governor,' whom she believed\r\nsmothered in his diplomacy, for he appeared never to want anything but\r\nthe spittoon, and now and then, at long intervals, a clean pair of\r\nstockings. Arriving at the door, I rang lustily the bell, and soon\r\nthere appeared a very stiff flunky, in democratic livery of bright\r\ncolors, who bowed me into a great hall, and after grinning at me for\r\nabout a minute, said he reckoned I was a citizen o' the United\r\nStates. 'From Vermont, I take it?' he continued, in quick succession.\r\nI told him it was no matter about that; if he had no objection I would\r\ntake a look at his governor. While I was deliberating, the\r\nbest-looking 'yellow fellow' outside of Carolina made his appearance,\r\nand immediately commenced taking charge of me. He said he understood\r\ndiplomacy all up, (having studied dancing and attended Mrs. Sprat's\r\ntea-parties for more than two years!) and would put me through if I\r\nsaid the word. Then he added, with a _sang froid_ that seemed quite\r\ngrateful, that though he wasn't exactly governor of the establishment,\r\nhe would show me up to the man who was, and under whose dictation\r\nMr. Buckhanan had for peace sake accepted a fifth-rate position. On my\r\nmotioning him to proceed (he seemed much inclined to affect a good\r\ndeal of etiquette) the fellow led off, through a long dark passage,\r\ncrowded with empty Genessee flour barrels, champagne baskets, boxes of\r\ncast off pipes (breathing redolent of tobacco), decrepit arm-chairs,\r\nold foils and boxing-gloves, numerous empty beer-bottles, a lot of\r\nworn-out dancing slippers, and a quantity of second-hand nightgowns\r\nand side-saddles. What use diplomacy had for these abused relics we\r\nleave the reader to conjecture. Opening a door on the left, my guide\r\nwith a bow accompanying a graceful bend of the body, ushered me into a\r\nspacious room, with the announcement:--'A gemman fum de States,\r\nMr. Prompt!' No Mr. Prompt could I see, such was the state of the\r\natmosphere. In fact, I was set upon by a perfect fog of tobacco smoke.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, stranger--glad to see ye this side the big pond!' croaked out\r\na little sharp voice, peculiarly nasal. I replied I thought it was\r\nrather foggy about these diggins. 'No matter about that,' he rejoined,\r\n'we do clean business in this establishment, notwithstanding the\r\npuffing, we deem it necessary to keep up in diplomatic matters.' The\r\natmosphere clearing a little, and objects becoming bolder outlined, I\r\ndiscovered a figure so singularly lean and sharp of visage that you\r\nwould have sworn him peculiarly adapted by Providence for cutting his\r\nway into a better world. Upon the walls of the rooms, which were very\r\ndingy, hung suspended, tomahawks, bowie-knives, scalping-knives, bows\r\nand steel-pointed arrows, an innumerable variety of dressed scalps,\r\nmuch worn Indian uniforms, and various other things--all adapted to\r\nWestern warfare. Here and there stood sundry reed chairs and cronic\r\ntables, of Florida pine, while the floor was very liberally set off\r\nwith what are vulgarly called spit-boxes, which, unlike the pages of\r\nan antiquated Bible that lay neglected in one corner, had been very\r\ngenerally used. Smooth would here say that such adjuncts as the\r\nlatter, seemed to be, judging from their presence in all our Legations\r\non the Continent, inseparable from Pierce diplomacy. In the present\r\ncase there were, in addition to the above-named fixtures, seventeen\r\npatent rat-traps, with which members of the Legation amused themselves\r\nwhen not invited to dancing parties. Smooth could not help thinking\r\nthere was no need of the latter pieces of furniture, while Mr. Prompt,\r\nthe sharp gentleman, was in the establishment. Indeed, Mrs. Grundy\r\nwould have said he was sharp enough to be used as an instrument for\r\nsplitting the nicest diplomatic points; while the promiscuous relics\r\nof antiquity arranged along the passage she would have sworn\r\nillustrated nothing so nicely as Pierce's confused policy, the saddles\r\nbeing indicative of how easily he rode over the credulity of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"In the centre of the room stood a five-legged round table, somewhat\r\nnervous and infirm of age. Upon it stood, badly arranged, two tumblers\r\nof Cuba sixes, an ample stock of fine cut tobacco, about a dozen long\r\nand much discolored pipes, a spacious ash-box, and the dirty boots of\r\nPrompt, his lean figure sprawled back in a dilapidated arm-chair, a\r\nlong nine in his mouth, from which he incessantly puffed an immense\r\nvolume of smoke. Prompt's face was a perfect picture of edge-tools;\r\nand with his easy air generally, his hands stowed away in the ample\r\npockets of his nether garments; his passion for the Byronic--made\r\nknown by the extravagant roll of a turn-down shirt collar--and his\r\nbushy hair thrown back on a veiny and narrow forehead that seemed to\r\nhave been cut away to fit his hat, had an appearance easily imagined\r\nby those who have witnessed in New Hampshire the general make-up of an\r\nitinerant stump orator. I bowed as he cast his eyes along down my\r\nfigure, and gave a friendly wink. 'From York State, I take it?' he\r\ncontinued. I replied I had been in York State, but was born on Cape\r\nCod. 'Well,' he rejoined, 'don't matter where a feller's born nor\r\ngrow'd, only he's got the right sort o' bone and siners in him.' The\r\ngeneral appearance of things had mightily changed since I last visited\r\nthe place--in truth, I could scarcely believe my own eyes. Mr. Prompt\r\nnow drew forth a handful of long nines, said he never liked to smoke\r\nalone, and invited me to join him. I excused myself as well as I\r\ncould, adding that I had no small vices. The truth was, the\r\nspit-boxes, and rat-traps, and a large supply of tobacco, looked so\r\nsuspicious, that I was at a loss how to comport myself: I feared I had\r\ngot into the wrong box. 'Anyhow,' said Mr. Prompt, 'bring yourself to\r\na mooring--remember we treat all citizens alike here--and be quite at\r\nhome in the establishment. Smooth, I believe, is the name?' He looked\r\nat my card as I bowed, expecting every moment to see him rise from his\r\neasy posture. With a sort of languid endurance he said the\r\nestablishment was at my service--that anything I desired would be put\r\nthrough like Jehu. A set of snobby fellows, he said, had for a number\r\nof years made a den of aristocracy of the place, but the aspect of\r\nthings had been changed now to suit the good fellow-spirit of our\r\ninstitutions. Here he drew a deformed hat over his forehead, and let\r\nfly a moist projectile; which, instead of taking effect in a box of\r\nsaw-dust, expanded ineffectually upon the face of a female dog-iron. I\r\nsuggested that it warn't so bad a shot. He replied, he reckoned--Just\r\nat this moment the full yellow face of the negro protruded itself into\r\nthe doorway. 'Mas'r,' he ejaculated, 'dat's da geman (pointing to\r\nPrompt, whose face was seen to contract) what do up all da plomacy ob\r\ndis establishment.' The yellow face withdrew behind the green\r\nbaize. All this time I had been careful not to disclose to Mr. Prompt\r\nthat I was minister in general to Mr. Pierce.\r\n\r\n\"'Citizen,' said he, continuing his cigar, 'that ar nigger's sassy\r\nenough for three legations. Pierce sent him here;--for what, no one\r\nabout the establishment can tell. Anyhow, seeing it's you, I was about\r\ngiving out an idea of what an interminable muddle Pierce would get\r\neverything into if he had but his own way; but, as there isn't time\r\nnow, and as you won't join me in a cigar, suppose we send out and have\r\na first-rate brandy-smash?'\r\n\r\n\"This I respectfully declined; I thought it would give him so much\r\ntrouble. Indeed, he said there was so much to do about the\r\nestablishment, and nobody to do it except himself. In reply to a\r\nquestion, he said, the governor--meaning Mr. Buckanan--had worked\r\nhimself out, and was laid away to dry. At present he alone constituted\r\nthe establishment. There used to be a secretary (the salary, he had\r\nreason to believe Uncle Sam yet paid) but nothing had been seen of him\r\nfor several months: when last heard from, he was entering into a\r\npartnership with Monsieur Souley for the purchase of Cuba, at any\r\nprice. As for the attaches, one got no pay, and was expected by the\r\ngovernment to do a deal of work, while the amount paid to the other\r\nwas so small that he very wisely spent it in cab-hire to see the\r\nsights, which it just covered. One might be almost sure of seeing the\r\nformer gentleman on the approach of a court concert, while the\r\npresence of the other at the legation prognosticated the advent of a\r\ndrawing-room. In fact, Mr. Prompt said, with considerable logic, that\r\nwhen people were only half paid they were sure to do nothing. As for\r\nhimself (here he smiled, and commenced a new cigar), why he did up the\r\ndiplomacy of the establishment by the job--that is, he absorbed in his\r\nlean person the functions of minister plenipotentiary, secretary of\r\nlegation, and gentlemanly attaches. And for the performance of their\r\nduties (the pickings were not worth mentioning) he would, at the end\r\nof a few years, make out his account against Uncle Sam, whom he was\r\nsure was too straightforward and generous not to allow it. 'Fact is,\r\nstranger,' he reiterated with great assurance, 'I am almost worked to\r\ndeath here.' A monster gray cat having entered the room, and inspected\r\ncuriously the several rat-traps, Mr. Prompt, as if much annoyed, drew\r\nhimself with great effort from the crippled chair, and drove her\r\nunceremoniously out of the room, accompanying her retreat with Peters\r\non diplomacy. 'Then, Mr. Prompt,' said I, 'may I consider myself\r\nentirely in your hands?' Again spreading his boots on the table, and\r\nlanguidly elongating his lean body, he replied, 'nothin shorter!' In\r\nanswer to a question, he said he could fix me out with anything--from\r\na passport to a grindstone. In fact, he was a man of universal\r\nqualities, and could accommodate the needy with almost anything. He\r\ncould issue a passport for the infernal regions; he could give a card\r\nto dine with old Jones when one got there; and by way of facilitating\r\nmatters, lend him a saddle to ride there. I admitted he was\r\nexceedingly generous, and well calculated to bring out all the various\r\nfunctions known to diplomacy; but, having no taste for the sport he\r\nproposed, intimated my preference for a box at the Opera, or an\r\ninvitation to dine with her Majesty. 'Well, I do declare,' says\r\nPrompt, who was seized with a very troublesome cough, 'if you ain' got\r\na-head on me there!' Seeing his confusion, I begged he would pardon\r\nthe intimation. In reply, he good-naturedly drawled out, 'them things,\r\nsomehow, don't come within the privileges of this establishment. Can\r\naccommodate ye with a box at the Theatre Royal, Westminster--play the\r\nvery best sort of patent farces in that national place of amusement.\r\nThen they've an audience so forbearing, that it makes no matter what\r\nthey play, and the fun of that establishment beats bull-fighting all\r\nholler. Should the low-comedy man some call Pam, and his walking\r\ngentleman, John, chance to have steam up, you will be sure to get your\r\nmoney's worth. Take my word, said he: Covent Garden and Drury Lane are\r\nbut dull show shops compared with it.' Again I thanked Mr. Prompt for\r\nhis kindness, and told him I would wait till the next bull-baiting\r\ncame off--understanding from good authority that such amusing\r\nspectacles in that house had frequent possession of the boards. Did I\r\nwant to revel in the sights and dark places of London, Mr. Prompt said\r\nI had better wait the return of the absent secretary, which could not\r\nbe more than six months hence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nSMOOTH DISCOVERS HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Now, citizen!' said I, thinking it was about time I disclosed to\r\nMr. Prompt who I was, and also the character of my mission, 'as you\r\nseem to be the establishment in general, and can grant such very\r\naccommodating passports, let me inform you that I, Solomon Smooth, am\r\nMister Pierce's Minister Extraordinary, to Europe in particular.' Mr.\r\nPrompt's sharp visage now became sharper. 'Pierce,' I said, 'had\r\ncommissioned me to call together all the boys, in congress at Ostend.'\r\nIn testimony of what I had set forth I produced the document, at the\r\nsight of which he relieved himself of a very handsome bow, brought his\r\nlean body to a perpendicular, and, with an effort at modesty, laid\r\naside his hat and cigar; this I regarded as creditable to the\r\nestablishment. 'The governor's cum, Mas'r Prompt!' exclaimed the\r\nnegro, again thrusting his full yellow face into the door. Prompt was\r\nevidently abashed at this sudden announcement.\r\n\r\n\"'I'll see the governor, if you have no objection,' said I, attempting\r\nto relieve his quandary. He replied he had none whatever; that I would\r\nfind him a trump, though rather low. 'He seldom comes out of this\r\nplace!' ejaculated Prompt, leading the way through an extremely narrow\r\nand crooked passage into a dark cloister-like room, lighted by a small\r\nlamp that shed a sickly light over the few antiquated pieces of\r\nfurniture it contained. 'Minister Smooth will please to introduce\r\nhimself!' said Mr. Prompt, ushering me into the room, and closing the\r\ndoor as he retired. Descrying through the pale glow of the lamp my\r\nvenerable friend Buck, who was seated at a table in the centre of the\r\nroom, amusing himself with the cat Prompt had so unceremoniously\r\nkicked out of his presence, he immediately recognized me; the\r\nreception I met would have done honor to companions in the Continental\r\nWar, meeting after a long absence. He said Saunders and his boy Dan\r\n(that is, he was boy to Dan) had reduced his light wonderfully. Here\r\nhe began pricking up the wick of the old lamp, while I drew up a seat\r\nand commenced without further ceremony disclosing the object of my\r\nvisit, and making known to him some of Pierce's opinions (private) on\r\nmatters in general. 'Read this carefully,' said I, handing him my\r\ninstructions from the State Department. He took the document like one\r\ncompelled to do a thing against his will, while I attentively watched\r\nthe changes that came over his countenance as he read it. 'Indurable\r\nPierce!' he muttered, adding a languid sigh. Then his portly figure\r\nseemed to expand, his hair to grow whiter, and his general appearance\r\nto assume a more venerable air, as he read the portion that\r\nparticularly directed me to bag him, pro or con. Indeed, his crooked\r\neye became straight with indignation, while his neck no longer\r\nretained its wonted curve. 'I have studied the man, but find I yet\r\nknow little of him!' said he, recovering his usual calmness, and\r\nshaking his head significantly. I inquired if he meant Pierce. He\r\nreplied, testily, in the affirmative. 'Several times has he made me\r\ncut a ridiculous figure in the eyes of the nation. I cannot disclose\r\nmy true position,--he knows that, but will have me a partner to this\r\nmost stupid of projects;--well, well!' Here he seemed in the act of\r\nyielding to his despondency, when to revive him I presented several\r\nprivate notes which I had received from Pierce, explanatory of his\r\nviews with reference to the immense benefit that would accrue to the\r\nnation, and manifest destiny, from this great congress. 'Now Smooth,'\r\ncontinued the old man, relieving his mouth of an encumbrance, which,\r\nmissing its aim, took effect in the face of the cat, which set up a\r\nfearful yell and scampered out of the room, 'although I can't\r\nunderstand Pierce, I have great confidence in you, and there is\r\nsomething so ridiculous about this affair that I feel like relieving\r\nmy mind to you, which I do without prejudice. I care not to examine\r\nyour confidential notes; they are doubtless of a like character with\r\nthose I have myself received from him on this very subject. The man\r\nseems crazed. He has inundated me with confidential trifles about\r\nCuba, the affairs of Europe, the Central American question, and the\r\nholding a Congress at Ostend. I am bored to death with his opinions,\r\nwhich, on the policy of the latter, are cheap indeed.' The old man now\r\nbecame exceedingly nervous; indeed, he seemed like one laboring under\r\nthe first symptoms of an over-dose of Parr's Life Pills. 'Smooth! I am\r\nsacrificed; yes, sir, literally sacrificed to all his folly! The\r\ndespatch bag has groaned under the very pressure of his nonsense,\r\nwhich I am compelled to read and commit to the flames, lest our nation\r\nshould suffer by its disclosures. I have appealed to him on behalf of\r\nmy conscience; I have reasoned from the depths of my experience; I\r\nhave besought him to spare my reputation--and here you bring me fresh\r\nproof that it has all gone to no purpose.' I could not help pitying\r\nthe venerable old man as he shrugged his shoulders, and gave such a\r\ndesponding look. 'Pierce,' he continued, 'will smash the democracy\r\nbefore he has done, by simply making it ridiculous. Thrice have I\r\nremonstrated with him in all my power of persuasion; but it has fallen\r\nharmless at his feet, for here he is, up again and harping. He\r\nsingularly argues in his private despatches that Europe being in a\r\nfuzzle generally; that England having enough to do at keeping her\r\ngrumbling people quiet, and fighting her old friend Russia; that\r\nMonsieur Napoleon, the very Republican Emperor, having three large\r\nkettles of fish to fry--one in helping England to whip Russia, by\r\nwhich means he hoped to wipe off an old score; the second, to affect a\r\ngreat determination to fight for the independence of the Turks, who\r\nsay they will lend a hand when they get in cash; and the third, to\r\ncrush all revolutionary movements at home; and that all having enough\r\nto do in their work of protecting despotism and neglecting liberty,\r\nthe time is singularly opportune for America's making one grand\r\ndemonstration. Thus, he said, Pierce argued. It was all very well\r\nshowing a saucy front to mankind in general, but if we undertook to\r\nbag Cuba, there must be something more than threats and war messages\r\nto back it up.' I could not throw up my commission; therefore begged\r\nmy friend Buck would consider my position, and excuse in me what\r\nseemed fast. And then I had despatched my Corporal Noggs to arrange\r\nmatters with Monsieur Souley, who was to play the part of\r\nengine-driver, crowding charcoal for the whole team. After the\r\nmanifestation of much indecision, my friend Buck consented to go, at\r\nthe same time stipulating that he should not be led by certain fast\r\nspirits. 'If I go, Smooth,' said he, 'it will be with virtuous\r\nreluctance; the whole thing is sure to come out. Further, my boy Dan\r\n(a sharp fellow he is!) has gone on a little affair respecting Cuba,\r\nby which he expects to make hit No. 1.'\r\n\r\n\"At this moment we were interrupted by the brusque figure of George\r\nSaunders appearing in the room. George instantly recognized me, and\r\nsaid he anticipated my mission, having received sundry private and\r\nvery confidential letters from Pierce on the same subject. It seemed\r\nthat Pierce and his boy Fourney had written any amount of private and\r\nconfidential letters on this to be kept very secret affair. George\r\nmade himself quite at home. Indeed, the uninitiated might have\r\nmistaken him and the cat for fixtures of the establishment. Calling me\r\non one side, he begged I would consider Mr. Buckanan entirely in his\r\nhands. In order to bring his speed to the right gauge, Dan and himself\r\nhad, he said, spent several months hard labor; but now he was happy to\r\nsay they had found the key to his movements, and nothing more was\r\nwanting. As for Buck's presence at the Ostend convention, just leave\r\nthe arranging that to him. Further, in order to make a demonstration\r\nwhile it was sitting, he would write an epistle to the Emperor of\r\nAustria, forewarning him of the sympathy in America for the spirits he\r\nheld down in oppression. This would be a decided hit, he added, with a\r\nknowing wink. So confident was George of his mastery over the\r\nvenerable old man, that I felt it would not be prejudicing Mr.\r\nPierce's interests to leave the matter entirely in his hands: so\r\nbidding them a very good morning, I signified my intention of calling\r\nagain in ten days, when I expected he would be ready to move on; if\r\nnot, I should be under the painful necessity of bagging him, as\r\ndirected by the State Department.\r\n\r\n\"I had left the legation, and was passing into Portland place, when,\r\nto my surprise, I was overtaken by the indomitable George, who\r\ninsisted that I join him in some gin-and-bitters at the first\r\ndrinking-place. To have declined George's amiability would have been\r\nimmaculate folly: he always bagged his friends, precisely as Pierce\r\ndirected me to bag the ambassador. Having stopped at the first\r\ncrossing, as they say in Georgia, we drunk ourselves, wished Pierce\r\nmuch joy with his project, and parted, George saying he would turn\r\nsteam on the old man, and have him all right when I called.\r\n\r\n\"Prompt to the hour, no sooner had the allotted time expired than I\r\npresented myself at the Legation with an express wagon, for the\r\naccommodation of the old man indispensable. Corporal Noggs had got the\r\nboys all right on the continent, and such a jolly time as was\r\nexpected! George had evidently been screwing up the old man, for I\r\nfound him in the very best humor. There he sat, portly and venerable,\r\nsurrounded by boxes, carpet-bags, and trunks; all, he assured me,\r\ncontaining various diplomatic implements of great value. At his feet\r\npurred the cat diplomatic, as if anxious to accompany him. 'These\r\nboxes are a great trouble to me,' said the old man, getting up with\r\nsome effort, and pointing to three, about two feet square each, and\r\nlabelled as follows:--No. 1, '_Cuba by purchase_,' below--'_Copies of\r\nCorrespondence with our Minister to Spain, some years ago_,' at the\r\nleft corner the words--'_Promiscus_.' No. 2. '_Cuba at any\r\nprice_'--underneath--'_This side up, with care?_' No. 3. '_Cuba of\r\nnecessity, and as a link in the manifest fulfilment of\r\ndestiny?_'--underneath--'_Handled only by the experienced porter_.'\r\n\r\n\"The hall now rang loud of confusion,--the fiery-eyed cat ran\r\nscreaming to the door, maids' eyes were seen wanting to weep, Prompt\r\naffected great grief,--he would be worked to death,--porters were seen\r\ncarrying out the luggage, and then waited to convey the old man. Then\r\nPrompt said--the negro, as if to make the picture complete, was making\r\nall sorts of grimaces in a corner,--if Dan should by some accident\r\nreturn, what a deal of extra work he would make! But Smooth made up\r\nhis mind that such complaints were the natural consequences of an\r\nirregular system. At last, having got boxes one, two, and three nicely\r\ncared for, we bundled in the rest of the traps, following then with\r\nthe old man indispensable. Saunders being present by appointment,\r\ninsisted upon his right to drive the team, and suddenly springing upon\r\nthe box, seized unceremoniously the reins, and put the horses into\r\nfull gallop. Increasing his speed, until it became frightful to\r\ndelicate nerves, the poor old man's fears for his safety became so\r\nexcited that it required all my strength to keep him from jumping out\r\nand breaking his neck, notwithstanding I had tucked him away so nicely\r\namong the boxes before starting. Down Portland place, through Oxford\r\nstreet, up Holborn, and down Cheapside, to the Bank (astonishing the\r\nnatives as we went) we drove, and from thence to St. Katherine's Dock,\r\nwhere was moored the trim little steamboat chartered to convey Mr.\r\nPierce's plenipotentiaries safe to Ostend. Buck was in a sad state of\r\nexcitement when we stopped; he resembled an individual just escaped\r\nfrom a perilous adventure. He discharged himself clumsily from the\r\nwagon, his face undergoing singular changes of color the while, and\r\ncast a few savage glances at Saunders, who very composedly sat on the\r\nbox endeavoring with might and main to suppress a vagabond laugh.\r\n'Now, Saunders,' indistinctly sputtered the old man, as that\r\nbluff-sided individual turned upon his seat, rather knavely casting a\r\ncomical glance over his shoulder, 'I'm not afraid--my courage never\r\nfails me; but that steamer don't take me to Ostend if you're a\r\npassenger! Mind that now!' Saunders lowered himself gravely from the\r\nbox, and with serious countenance assured the old man that no danger\r\ncould result while he drove the team. In reply to this, the old man\r\ndeclared that with Saunders on board a blowing-up was certain. The\r\nmuch-dreaded gentleman, however, soon quieted the envoy's fears by\r\nassuring him that accompanying us to Ostend was farthest from his\r\nthoughts, he having made all the necessary arrangements for throwing a\r\nbomb-shell into the camp from this side of the water, as directed by\r\nthe Uncle Caleb and the boy Fourney. Boxes one, two, and three being\r\nsafely on board, we supported the old governor after them--Saunders on\r\none side, and Smooth on the other. Then the bell rang, and the steam\r\nthundered and roared, and the little craft glided on her way, Saunders\r\nwaving his adieus from the wharf, and crying out at the very top of\r\nhis voice--'Don't forget Cuba!' and 'go it, Buck! Go it, Smooth!!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nARRIVAL AND GRAND RECEPTION AT OSTEND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Our passage was attended with extremely pleasant weather; and nothing\r\nremarkable occurred, except that the Dutch crew thought Mr. Buckhanan\r\na very great man, and the object of his mission the overthrow of\r\nEuropean dynasties in general. Twice they undertook to regale him with\r\nsour-krout, which he pronounced inferior to that made in York county,\r\nPennsylvane. As to me, they declined to be convinced that I was not\r\nGovernor of Kentucky, having a singular belief in the peculiarities of\r\nthat State for growing long citizens--the tallest man always being\r\nelected governor. Perhaps I should have added that the Schiedam was\r\nonly tolerable, the brandy bad; and that Buck, having forgotten his\r\ntobacco, was compelled to resort to very bad Dutch loggerhead, with\r\nwhich he kept the swabs busily employed.\r\n\r\n\"As we entered the port of Ostend, once so celebrated for the defence\r\nof its garrison, a salute of thirteen guns was fired from the old\r\nfort, which we attempted to answer with a rusty swivel, Buck waving\r\nhis hat, and singing 'Yankee Doodle' to the burghers who filed along\r\nthe dilapidated dyke. As the steamer neared a landing-place, we\r\ndescried the coarse figure of Corporal Noggs, surrounded by numerous\r\nof his fellow citizens, prominent among whom was Monsieur Souley and\r\nthe Chevalier Belmont. In addition to these welcoming spirits, there\r\ncame also a Dutch band, which, ere we had made fast alongside, struck\r\nup something they intended for _Hail, Columbia!_ The reader will\r\nplease appeal to his imagination as to what our reception must have\r\nbeen, when I tell him that shouts and huzzas, interspersed with this\r\ndiscordant 'Hail Columbia!' rent the very air, and made faint the\r\nroaring of the steam from the funnel of our little craft. Boxes one,\r\ntwo, and three, were now sent forward under an escort to the hotel,\r\nwhile a triumphal chair secured to two long poles was placed in proper\r\norder for the reception of my friend Buck. Rather against his\r\ninclination, and not without expressing some doubt as to the propriety\r\nof displaying so much pageantry in a foreign country, was he packed\r\ninto it by Monsieurs Souley and Belmont. Corporal Noggs now formed in\r\norder the procession, which moved in state through the city, headed by\r\nthe band playing the 'Rogue's March,' which it mistook for 'Yankee\r\nDoodle.' Such a funny procession! The reader may imagine the figure\r\ncut by my venerable friend, when I tell him that the triumphal chair\r\nwas borne on the shoulders of Monsieurs Souley, Belmont, Daniels, and\r\nO'Sullivan--the two former being in the lead. Close in the rear of\r\nthe chair, your humble servant, Smooth, took up his position, riding a\r\nfemale jackass, an animal domesticated by Monsieur Souley, under whose\r\nsaddle she had borne up until the flesh was nearly off her bones. This\r\nwas tapered off with an everlasting string of seedy citizens, for whom\r\nan innumerable quantity of goats seemed to have a fellow sympathy, so\r\nclose did they follow. At the hotel, from the balcony of which\r\nstreamed the stars and stripes, the uproar and confusion was beyond\r\ndescription. Could some of the old burghers have risen from the tomb,\r\nthey might have imagined a modern siege of that city they so nobly\r\ndefended in times gone by. Staggering and sweating, the four envoys\r\nbore their precious burden to the great porch, whence he was escorted\r\nto the balcony, upon which he stood, like a Roman of old, and, by the\r\nadvice of Monsieur Souley, delivered a stunning speech, that versatile\r\nfunctionary translating it into Dutch. It will scarcely be necessary\r\nto add that the speech proved a decided hit, and was received with\r\nshouts and acclamations. Not a little done over, the old statesman was\r\nnow regaled on delicious krout and gin-slings, and put carefully to\r\nbed by a Dutch chambermaid. This was at three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. At seven I marshalled all hands for a grand banquet, which\r\nhad been prepared without any regard to expense, it being intimated\r\nthat Uncle Sam would settle for the whole thing.\r\n\r\n\"Fresh and refreshed we all appeared ready for action, and as bright\r\nas could possibly be expected after such a fatigue. The table was set\r\nout in grand style; indeed, it literally groaned under every delicacy\r\nof the season--not excepting krout, the glows of which impregnated the\r\natmosphere. Buck said he would sit opposite the krout; but that was\r\nobjected to, on the ground of his eating so much as to change the tone\r\nof his speech, which was expected to be more than usually\r\nspirited. After so little opposition from Monsieur Souley, who wanted\r\nthe place himself, it was voted that I should take the chair. Of\r\ncourse I could not refuse the honor; but in order to illustrate the\r\nthree principles of our political policy, I was cautious to stipulate\r\nthat Buck sit on my right and Monsieur Souley on my left. Here we\r\nwere--steady, very steady, and very fast. Belmont insinuated, rather\r\nironically, that Buck could no longer be considered of the steady\r\nschool; in fact, Saunders had so cultivated his component parts that\r\nhe might now, without any fear of contradiction be put down as\r\nremarkably fast. I need scarcely add that the viands were discussed\r\nwith great gusto, Monsieur Souley absorbing so much of the _fricasee\r\nfrog_ that his glossy black hair, which had before beautifully\r\nundulated over his shoulders, now curled tighter, his eyes sparkled\r\nbrighter, his face became more olive, and his periods more intensely\r\nFrench. O'Sullivan, too, had procured some capital Irish whiskey,\r\nwhich he said he already felt in his boots. At ten o'clock there was a\r\ngeneral secession of knife and fork, and a resort to the less tasteful\r\namusement of speech-making. Souley, however, had all the while said\r\nall manner of things about, and brought all sorts of charges against\r\nLouis Napoleon, whose government he denounced in very general terms,\r\nnot dreaming that that shrewd sovereign had introduced two spies in\r\nthe capacity of waiters. The cloth being removed, Monsieur rose,\r\nconsidering he was in duty bound, and commenced throwing off the\r\nrounded sentences of the first part of a very long speech,--at one\r\nmoment denouncing princes and kings in general, and in the next\r\nthreatening to smother Spain with an interesting exposition of her\r\nperfidy. Her puppet government was a base mockery; he said Espartero\r\nhad grossly deceived him!--Here he was brought to a stand by\r\nMr. O'Sullivan, 'It's meself thinks the gintleman 's about debatin\r\nmatter what 'll cum afore the Convention to-morrow,' interposed that\r\ngentleman. Monsieur Souley replied somewhat tartly: he hoped the\r\ngentleman from Ireland would not interrupt him. Order! was now called\r\nfor on every side, and an appeal made to the chair, without whose\r\ninterposition a savage encounter must have resulted. The whole company\r\nwere now on foot, interposing for peace; nor had I time to assert my\r\nauthority, when, decanters of port and claret standing close at hand,\r\nSouley seized one, and O'Sullivan the other, as if for weapons of\r\nmortal combat, and commenced a series of threatening menaces. The\r\nwaiters were not accustomed to such feints, and one, before we were\r\nconscious, of it had run down stairs and alarmed the house. Landlord,\r\nservants, and a whole troup of police, came rushing into the hall, as\r\nthe two gentlemen of Verona, revealing the joke, made the politest\r\nbows over their glasses, which they gracefully emptied. I was about\r\ndeciding that Monsieur Souley's language was decidedly personal, when\r\nhe proclaimed his determination to postpone his speech until\r\nto-morrow. He would however, conclude by proposing a toast, which he\r\nneed scarcely add would be heartily responded to by every one\r\npresent. He would propose the health of the venerable statesman on the\r\nchairman's right--a man who had long and worthily maintained the\r\nhighest rank among his country's statesmen, and whose opinions\r\n(although he differed with them at times) were world-wide! (Great\r\nsensation). Mr. Buckhanan now rose, evidently affected by the\r\nimmensity of the cheers. His mien was at once dignified, and when\r\ncontrasted with the promiscuous countenances that surrounded him, wore\r\nan air singularly American. He began by saying he was happy to say he\r\ndid not feel himself a stranger in a strange land. (This being\r\ntranslated into Dutch by Monsieur Souley, the invited guests present\r\nreceived it with loud acclamations). We read the same books; we were\r\nanimated by a kindred love of liberty; we spoke the same language; we\r\nenjoyed the same immunities of a constitutional government; and that\r\nspirit which animated us to fight for liberty had its origin in the\r\nsame stock! Here Mr. Belmont interposed by reminding the venerable\r\nstatesman that the Dutch of Pennsylvania and New York could not be\r\nsaid properly to represent the whole American Union. Order being\r\ndemanded and restored, Mr. Buckhanan apologised for the grave error,\r\nwhich he charged to the delicious quality of the krout. He seemed\r\nunconscious of what he had been saying, and suddenly became aware that\r\nhe had mistaken his theme, and was letting off the big end of his\r\nmodel speech, with which he had so often entertained his friends at\r\nfeeds given by sundry Lord Mayors of London. The joke was too good;\r\nthe old man could not suppress a laugh at his own mistake, and sat\r\ndown, intimating that as he would have something to say to-morrow he\r\nwould now bring his speech to a close. (Uproarious applause). Again\r\nMonsieur Souley rose, and amid shouts of--'question!' said the\r\nquestion was of no kind of consequence, that he always went on the\r\nprinciple of making himself heard. Further attempts to rein up\r\nMonsieur Souley would have been sheer madness; so he continued his\r\nspeech, which included fifty irrelevant topics without discussing\r\none. He even charged Louis Napoleon with poisoning the champagne.\r\nWhatever of truth there might be in the charge, we only know that the\r\nspeaker ere he had concluded his speech found himself standing alone,\r\nthe whole Congress having dropped off into a profound sleep. Becoming\r\nindignant at this display of indifference, he stopped suddenly,\r\ncommanded the waiters to wake up the sleepers, and himself commenced\r\nan uproar by smashing the tumblers and decanters, after the fashion of\r\na French fiddler in for a frolic. The company with one accord offered\r\nan apology, joined in drinking the health of the speaker, charged the\r\ndelinquency to the strength of the poisoned champagne rather than that\r\nof the speech--(which was narcotic, rather), and adjourned to meet in\r\nDuitenethipicgnisher's Hall, at twelve o'clock on the following\r\nmorning. I must not omit to inform the reader that those who were\r\nunable to see their way up stairs were carried there by the\r\nwaiters. Smooth, as a matter of course, had no bricks in his hat.\r\n\r\n\"Bright and early on the following morning I tumbled out, made a hasty\r\ntoilet, and set about waking up the Congress of sleepers. Souley I\r\nfound in a sad plight; Buck was snoring like great guns; O'Sullivan I\r\nthought had either been dreaming of the Pampero expedition, or taken\r\ntoo much whiskey during the delivery of Monsieur Souley's speech;\r\nBelmont had made a pillow of his Dutch bonds--indeed the only specimen\r\nof humanity up and moving was Corporal Noggs, who expressed his\r\nanxiety to know what Marcy would say were he an eye-witness to the\r\npreliminaries. As for Pierce! it mattered little what he thought, he\r\nbeing a mere cypher among the boys. Having succeeded in moving the\r\nCongress we sallied out to view those suburbs so full of historical\r\nlore. To our surprise we were surrounded wherever we went by a\r\nclamorous and grotesque crowd of discontented individuals, each\r\nbearing a document in his or her hand, on which was prominently\r\ndescribed the great seal of the United States of America. For a time\r\nthe mystery involved seemed as undefinable as the jargon of the motley\r\ngroup. Indeed, the whole city seemed not only agog, but panic\r\nstricken. Nor was its influence confined to any class. It had delved\r\nalike into the palace of the king and cabin of the burgher. Wherever a\r\ndelegate made his appearance he was sure to be followed or surrounded\r\nby a clamorous group, pouring forth its jargon in a rhapsody of praise\r\nto America, which singularly enough they supposed had sent the first\r\ninstalment of her intention to overthrow the dynasties of Europe, and\r\nrelieve mankind in general. Monsieur Souley, whom they happily mistook\r\nfor a Greek, was the only member of the Congress exempt from the\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\"A little more light was soon reflected on the mystery! Saunders had\r\ninundated the city--not with his promised bombshells: his missile was\r\nmore alarming, but less dangerous. Having ingeniously changed the\r\nobject of a very long epistle, he dedicated it to the French people\r\ninstead of the Austrian Emperor. The mould of its dictum was decidedly\r\nstrong; but in order to add more point he gave his periods a peculiar\r\nslant, at the head of Napoleon the Third. That a fellow-feeling as\r\nlasting as the mountain chain existed between the French and American\r\npeoples, there was, according to the circular, not a doubt. In\r\nreference to other heads, there were strong doubts! The Congress now\r\nassembling was an earnest of what he said: that _august_ body George\r\nstrongly recommended to the esteem of all aggrieved citizens. Did any\r\none doubt the genuineness or the national character of these epistles\r\nhe had but to refer to the great seal on their front, which was none\r\nother than that of the Legation at London.\r\n\r\n\"The reader may now easily imagine our increasing difficulties. On\r\nproceeding to the Hall at the appointed time, I found our Ministers in\r\na general state of alarm. Souley had received a private and very\r\nconfidential letter from his agent in Paris, forewarning him of Louis\r\nNapoleon's intention to descend upon the Congress, perform a\r\n_coup-d'etat_, and having nicely bagged the game, appropriate it to\r\nhis own table. In view of this, Monsieur Souley recommended an\r\nadjournment to a more congenial atmosphere. Messrs. Buckhanan and\r\nBelmont rising together, objected to any such movement, inasmuch as it\r\nwould discover a spirit of weakness, to guard against which Uncle\r\nCaleb and Master Fourney had given express instructions. Here a long\r\ncross-fire of discussion ensued. I thought it had neither head nor\r\ntail, and was something after the order of what Mr. Pierce conceived\r\nto be the object of this Congress, for it resulted in nothing, the\r\nspeakers all agreeing to withdraw what they had said. As a first move\r\nto the organization of the body, it was agreed that Hanz Voghnine, who\r\nwas privileged to open a bar for the sale of good liquors in one\r\ncorner of the hall, would be the only outsider admitted. Hanz was\r\naccordingly examined in reference to his being a spy; the result being\r\nsatisfactory, he was enjoined to keep nothing but a first-rate\r\narticle. On the second balloting I found myself elected President,\r\nwhich high distinction, having been conducted to the chair amidst\r\nsoul-stirring acclamations, I acknowledged in what is generally termed\r\na neat and appropriate speech. Noggs was at the first ballot elected\r\nSergeant-at-Arms and door-keeper in general, the duty of which offices\r\nhe promised to fill to the very best of his abilities. A\r\nvagrant-opinion was rife that Monsieur Souley would have filled the\r\noffice of door-keeper much better, himself being so easily opened and\r\nshut. However, as Noggs had been voted the office, we all reconciled\r\nourselves to the selection, each member providing himself with a\r\ngin-sling, and taking his seat. A silence, as of the tomb, prevailed,\r\nwhile I rose to open the proceedings of the first day. I first made my\r\nown bow, then drew forth the State paper commissioning me to call\r\ntogether 'this august body.' Mr. O'Sullivan suggesting it was agreed\r\nthat there being out so many documents of a similar character the\r\nreading was rendered unnecessary. I bowed to the decision. A similar\r\nfate awaited an attempt to read several of Mr. Pierce's private\r\nopinions. Mr. Buckhanan said we better hear what Pierce had to say,\r\nand then make up our minds as to whether it was entitled to the\r\nconsideration of 'this important body.' Monsieur Souley replied, with\r\ngreat fervency, that it were better Pierce be left entirely out of the\r\nquestion, and the Congress proceed to deliberate on its own hook. A\r\ngood many dissenting voices here interposed; but the speaker, very\r\npertinaciously, said he had the floor, and was prepared to discuss the\r\nquestion with any gentleman (here he turned a meaning glance at Buck)\r\ndisposed to accept the challenge. The dread of a lengthy speech\r\nbrought gentlemen to their senses: rather than endure it they agreed\r\nthat Pierce should be left entirely out. It was, now generally\r\nexpected that Monsieur Souley would sit down. No such intention had\r\nhe. Turning to me, he bowed, and said: 'Your Excellency will observe,\r\nthat as the order in which the many questions to come before this\r\nCongress has not been produced, and the question of the acquisition of\r\nCuba to the United States being the most important one in the\r\nschedule, I move that the order be suspended, and that the discussion\r\nof that all-important subject be commenced.' Souley was inclined, I\r\nsaw, to absorb time very unprofitably. I was about to pronounce him\r\nout of order, when there came a loud knocking at the door, followed by\r\na band attempting to play a Dutch medley. The door was immediately\r\nthrown open. Ten citizens, savage and hairy of visage entered, to the\r\nconsternation of the Congress assembled. One of their number advanced,\r\nhaving exchanged the countersign with Noggs; but he failed to make\r\nhimself understood until Monsieur Souley politely tendered his aid,\r\nintroducing him in succession to every one present. They were,\r\naccording to the rendering of Monsieur, a deputation from the '_Very\r\nancient and honorable order of Red Republicans_,' who, having become\r\naware of the many grand objects for which our Congress was convened\r\n(as set forth in the circular of the great Saunders), had appeared\r\nbefore it to pray that their grievances might be duly redressed and\r\nthemselves reinstated in the government of France. Monsieur Souley\r\nmade a speech of more than ordinary length on the subject, which he\r\nbrought to a close by calling upon the President (me) not to permit\r\nthis patriotic body of suffering men to depart without an assurance\r\nthat their case would receive immediate attention. This I did in the\r\nvery best manner possible, adding that Hanz might treat them to\r\ngin-slings all round. This done, Monsieur politely bowed them into\r\nthe street, the last bow being his very best. The reader will by this\r\ntime have discovered that Monsieur Souley constituted the Congress and\r\nMr. Pierce thrown in.\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely had the deputation of very ancient and honorable red\r\nrepublicans taken itself into the street, when entrance was demanded\r\nby a deputation from 'The Hopeful Order of Polish Exiles.' The\r\nindividuals constituting it were lighter of person and complexion than\r\nthe reds; and, too, there was about them an air of melancholy which at\r\nonce touched the tender of my feelings. They bore with them a long\r\npetition, and humbly but devoutly prayed America to make their cause\r\nher own (here they produced several of Saunders' circulars): they\r\nasked only to enlist in her bond of brotherhood. Long had they waited\r\nthe coming of this day--the day when she would invade Europe, and\r\nfight the battle of Liberty against despotism. Sweet was the\r\nrecollection of a fatherland; to them it became sweeter as they\r\ncontemplated that great star of liberty all powerful in the West. They\r\nspoke Scandinavian in silvery accents. Monsieur Souley's genius was\r\nfor once at fault: he spoke only French, Dutch, and bad Spanish,\r\nrendering it necessary to call in the aid of Hanz, who, having\r\nrendered it into Dutch, Monsieur did the rest. Dismissing this very\r\ndistinguished deputation with a positive assurance that their case\r\nshould be at once referred to the great George Saunders, nothing more\r\nwas required. 'I would suggest,' spoke Mr. Belmont, rising with great\r\ngravity, as the satisfied gentlemen made their last bow at the door,\r\n'whether it be not necessary to close the door against further\r\ndeputations, it being expedient to proceed with the transaction of\r\nmore important business?' To this Messrs. Sullivan, Buckhanan, and\r\nSouley rose, greatly agitated. Souley said he had the floor, and would\r\nnot yield an inch. Mr. Buckhanan had only a word to say. Mr. Sullivan\r\ngave way. Monsieur Souley said he had great sympathy for all oppressed\r\ncitizens. He could not but characterize such language as had been used\r\nby the learned statesman, Mr. Belmont in reference to these very\r\nrespectable bodies, as contrary to the spirit of our institutions. Mr.\r\nBelmont bowed, and left the speaker to indulge his love of speech,\r\nwhich was again interrupted by a terrific thundering at the door,\r\nwhich opened,--not to a deputation, but to a whole platform of\r\nrejected humanity, presenting the most grotesque appearance.\r\nFalstaff's invincibles would convey no comparison. Some were hatless\r\nand shoeless; some had sleeveless coats and tattered trousers: others\r\nhad collars but no shirts; all had faces immersed in massive beards.\r\nTwo-and-two abreast, they walked, in with an independent air, each\r\nprovided with a Saunder's circular, and took up a position in a\r\nhalf-circle just behind the seats of the several members of the\r\nCongress. The person who represented them, and who could boast of but\r\none shoe, and one sleeve to his coat, and had a countenance smothered\r\nin hair, now approached Monsieur Souley as Monsieur Souley approached\r\nhim, and both bowed. I ought to have mentioned that this last\r\nprocession was preceded by one of their number, wheeling a barrow, on\r\nwhich was a monster petition, specifying the fifty thousand grievances\r\nthey hoped would be redressed by the Congress. Buck, who it was more\r\nthan suspected looked with suspicion upon the mixture of reds in\r\ngeneral, was seen squinting steadily in the faces of the\r\nsavage-looking intruders, while others could not suppress a laugh at\r\nthe singular quaintness of the picture they presented. The leader\r\nhaving extended his hand to Monsieur, a consultation ensued, and was\r\ncontinued with innumerable gestures, grimaces, and contortions of the\r\nface. The Chair begged to remind gentlemen of the importance of time.\r\nThe Chair hoped Monsieur Souley would find it convenient to report.\r\nThat versatile statesman replied,--He had the honor to inform this\r\naugust body, that these gentlemen--externally so\r\ndeficient!--constituted the 'Forlorn Order of _Very_ Red Republicans.'\r\nHere Monsieur turned to the forlorn order, as it, with one accord\r\nbowed, in confirmation of what he said. 'Gentlemen!' continued the\r\nspeaker with a rhetorical flourish, 'you must not judge these men by\r\ntheir exteriors. We have here the rough bark covering the fine\r\ntree. Gentlemen! have not these men hearts of oak, nerves of steel,\r\nand bone that, like their souls, never breaks in time of need?'\r\n\r\n\"The Chair thought it time to interrupt the speaker by inquiring what\r\nthe forlorn order prayed for? Monsieur Souley resumed. 'Learning from\r\nthe authority they held in their hands (epistle de la Saunders), what\r\nwere the true objects of this Congress, they had nobly come forward to\r\ntender their services, and to express in person their readiness to\r\ntake up arms in America's cause. He proposed a vote of thanks for this\r\npatriotic manifestation.' This was voted without a dissentient voice,\r\nseeing that it cost nothing. The spokesman of the order again held a\r\nconsultation with Monsieur Souley, the result of which was, that\r\ngentleman's making a charitable appeal to the Congress, and concluding\r\nby proposing that a contribution be taken in aid of the forlorns. This\r\nbrought Mr. Belmont suddenly to his feet. He would oppose any such\r\nthing. Their difficulties had already increased beyond calculation;\r\nand, were this proposition acceded to, it would not only confirm a\r\nsingular belief outside--that the object of this Congress was the\r\ngeneral relief of mankind, but so increase their responsibilities as\r\nto render it impossible to proceed with legitimate business. No sane\r\nman--much less one accustomed to dealing in coin--could have\r\nentertained such an idea. I need scarcely add that the proposition was\r\nnegatived without a dissenting voice, Monsieur Souley not voting. It\r\nwas now pretty evident to all present that the Congress would have its\r\ntime and attention pretty well absorbed in receiving deputations of\r\ncitizens deluded by Saunders' letters, and listening to the very\r\npathetic speeches of Monsieur. The day was now far gone; the Congress\r\nbegan to feel its appetite; the forlorns withdrew in discontent; the\r\npresence of many other deputations surrounding the doors was\r\nannounced; and the Congress drank all round, and adjourned to meet on\r\nthe following morning for the dispatch of business.\r\n\r\n\"The 'following morning' came, and with it troubles insurmountable.\r\nScarcely had the Congress resumed its sitting, when an avalanche of\r\ndeputations was announced, waiting an audience. Monsieur Souley\r\nproposed that they be received in their order. Of course I was bound\r\nto submit his proposal, but could not suppress a smile. I thought the\r\norder would be the most difficult thing to ascertain. However, as we\r\nare naturally good-natured, and love to turn the gravest subjects into\r\nthe lightest jokes, that they be received in their order was agreed to\r\nwithout a dissenting vote. By four o'clock in the afternoon we had\r\nreceived and heard the prayers of all sorts of deputations. There\r\nwas--'The Ancient Order of Roman Republicans;' the 'Lone Band of\r\nOppressed Brothers;' the 'Universal Brotherhood of Exiled Patriots;'\r\nthe 'Hopeful Band of Hungarian Refugees;' the 'Polish\r\nPerpetuators;'--in fact, there came all kinds of orders, and bonds,\r\nand leagues, and societies, all with innumerable grievances about they\r\nknew not what. There were the oppressed, and very oppressed; the\r\nhopeful, and very hopeful; the patriotic, and very patriotic; all\r\npraying that their grievances might be redressed. Indeed, they\r\nillustrated the fact that Europe was in no want of spirits. Some of\r\nthese forlorn brothers marched with bands of music, not only keeping\r\nthe city in a state of general alarm, but seriously disturbing the\r\nnervous systems of many very respectable persons, high in office.\r\n\r\n\"It was now six o'clock, and as the Congress was hungry, and fatigued\r\nwith its labors, and Hanz was literally worn out with mixing slings\r\nand smashes, I rose to propose we adjourn until to-morrow, seeing\r\nthere was no time to receive any more deputations; but was interrupted\r\nby Noggs, who significantly announced a platoon of soldiery in front\r\nof the hall. Monsieur Souley now turned a pale brown color; Belmont\r\nwas seen looking for a back-door; and Buck's hair changed two shades\r\nwhiter:--indeed, the alarm that had prevailed in sundry palaces\r\noutside seemed to have seized upon _our_ Congress.\r\n\r\n\"'A demand from the King!' announced Noggs, with ominous accent.\r\nSuddenly a suspicious-looking gent, smothered in dark uniform bespread\r\nwith a profusion of lace, was ushered in, and with an elastic step,\r\nand quick, wandering eye, approached gracefully the President (me) and\r\nannounced himself as King's Messenger. For a moment he stood\r\nuncovered, as if taking a bird's-eye-view of the mental qualities of\r\nAmerica; then, raising his right hand, which held a scroll, he\r\nextended it to the Chair as Mr. O'Sullivan demanded--'Hats off!' The\r\nsilence of a minute was then broken by Monsieur Souley, who, having\r\nregained his courage, interposed sarcastically,--'a messenger from the\r\nKing of the Dutch?' The official gave a glance in return, and bowed. A\r\nseat was now provided for the stranger, who, as he was about to sit\r\ndown, intimated that in the event of the terms of his Majesty's\r\nproclamation not being complied with, painful as it would be to his\r\nfeelings, he would, in deference to his orders, be compelled to resort\r\nto arms. It was a moment full of painful anxiety: the Chair cast an\r\neye over the document, as every one waited with eager suspense its\r\nbeing read aloud. At length, summoning to my aid all the dignity my\r\ncomposition entertained, I rose as each restless eye denoted hope and\r\nanxiety, and said I would read the King's commands, which were to the\r\nfollowing effect:--'That whereas sundry evil-disposed persons, not\r\nhaving the fear of God before their eyes, and representing themselves\r\nas citizens of the American Republic, have come into this country with\r\nill intent, and have, in defiance of law and order, held sundry\r\nmeetings for the purpose of conspiring against the peace of the State\r\nand safety of the throne; and whereas the said persons herein set\r\nforth have, since their landing on our beloved soil, conducted\r\nthemselves in a manner so riotous as to cause suspicion of their\r\ndeliberations, be it known to all concerned in this mysterious\r\ngathering, that by this my proclamation I forbid the holding of any\r\nsuch assemblies; and further, that unless that now in deliberation be\r\nat once dispersed, the persons found engaged in it will be dealt with\r\naccording to the law made and provided for the punishment of vagrants\r\nin general. Signed and sealed with our hands, &c., &c.' Need I say\r\nthat the reading this proclamation created a wonderful sensation,\r\nwhich was here and there interspersed with marks of contempt for its\r\nauthority. The Chair, I insinuated, would await any remarks. Mr.\r\nBuckhanan immediately rose, and proposed that we bow to the authority,\r\nand move to a more congenial atmosphere. Messrs. Souley, Belmont\r\n(having come back), and Jackson, rose to oppose. The King's Messenger\r\nalso rose: seeing the first symptoms of a powerful opposition\r\nmanifesting itself, he would warn gentlemen of the Congress that it\r\nwas of no use--they must move on! By way of adding tone to his demand,\r\nhe intimated that it might be necessary to motion his guard. As things\r\nbegan to look rather squally, I said the Chair would like to say a few\r\nwords, provided Monsieur Souley did not interrupt, and was perfectly\r\nwilling to yield the floor. That gentleman firmly declined; adding\r\nthat he stood upon the order of his reputation, nor would ever yield\r\nto Pierce, Marcy, and the King of the Dutch thrown in. He firmly\r\nbelieved it a trick of Marcy's own; he was known to be in league with\r\nthe Queen of Spain, Louis Napoleon, and the Dutch King, with whom he\r\nhad compromised the Gibson case. Mr. O'Sullivan, with good logic\r\nclothed in very bad English, now rose to the rescue, and was fortunate\r\nenough to hit upon the identical expedient by which we all got\r\nhonorably out of a very bad affair. He proposed (Mr. Souley continued\r\ntalking) that it being evident to this Congress that insurmountable\r\ndifficulties of a local character having arisen, thereby impeding the\r\nprogress of legitimate business; that whereas the oysters are found to\r\nbe diseased; the gin-and-bitters intolerable; the champagne poisoned\r\nby Louis Napoleon; and the sour krout absolutely indigestible, an\r\nadjournment is thereby imperatively necessary. In consideration of all\r\nthe foregoing facts, the speaker moved that this Congress do adjourn\r\nto the more congenial atmosphere of Aix-la-Chapelle. The motion was\r\ncarried with shouts of laughter, and the Congress broke up in the very\r\nbest humor, leaving Monsieur Souley in possession of the floor. In\r\naddition to this, the King's Messenger was carried captive to the\r\nfirst hotel and treated, while Noggs received orders to draw on Sam\r\nfor all outstanding bills.\r\n\r\n\"On the following morning the Congress took up its march for\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, resembling somewhat the children of Israel on their\r\nhistorical pilgrimage. In straggling order did the grotesque train\r\nwend its way,--Monsieur Souley mounted on the before-named jackass,\r\nwhich, having so long been accustomed to Monsieur's riding,\r\nobstinately refused to be mounted by my friend Buck, who was in\r\nconsequence seated on boxes '_one, two and three_,' which were placed\r\non a Dutch van, and drawn by two more docile donkeys, bringing up the\r\nrear. The world knows the rest--that is, with one exception! Buck told\r\nme, very confidentially, that the Congress had been fast enough for\r\nanything; that Pierce was soft enough to think good would come of it;\r\nand that he only put his signature to that remarkable document\r\nproclaiming our natural right to Cuba with virtuous\r\nreluctance,--merely to keep peace in the house!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nFASHIONABLE DEBTS AND FASHIONABLE DIPLOMATISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In days not altogether halcyon, I had a venerable great-uncle, a\r\nquaint specimen of human infirmity, the singularity of the parish.\r\nThough eccentric at times, he was not destitute of good qualities.\r\nThese, had they been properly applied, might have served to\r\ndistinguish him among men in what is pedantically called the higher\r\nwalks of life. But he had a fault, and one that is very unpopular even\r\nat this day: he would get vexed at the short-comings of his neighbors,\r\nat whom he would level truths exceedingly unpalatable. Indeed, he\r\nnever failed to put very keen edges on his sayings. Even now, I have\r\nthe old man in my mind's eye, as in the hey-day of youth my boyish\r\nfancy sported with his infirmities. Never shall I forget his slender,\r\nstooping figure; his bright bald crown, curtained with locks that\r\npended snowy over his coat collar; his weeping, watchful eye; his\r\ntottering mien; his high and furrowed brow, lengthening a sharp,\r\ncorrugated face; his blunt, warty nose, made more striking by a sunken\r\nmouth and the working motion of his lower jaw; and his crutch, for he\r\nwas a cripple. They left a deep impression on my mind. I speak of him\r\nas he was in the dawn of his eightieth summer--when pale blue spots\r\nbespread his hands, and his bony fingers he would when excited frisk\r\nacross the polished crown of his head. His great hobby was his\r\nknowledge of diplomacy. And, too, he was forever talking about the\r\naffairs of the nation, and would not unfrequently get put out with the\r\nwhole parish, because it withheld from him, he said, that deference\r\nhis experience was entitled to. He had, many years ago, been in some\r\nway attached to the diplomatic corps, which he ever after regarded\r\nwith a sort of religious awe; and whenever a strange fit came over him\r\nhe would do something he said was to prop up its dignity, of which\r\nnone could be more jealous. I have, known him declare, that to\r\nmaintain untarnished the character of the polite corps, he would swear\r\nby its virtue and his crutch. He would not have it held in suspicion\r\nby the vulgar world, and would go straight into a fit of sickness at\r\nthe news of one its members doing aught to sully the fair name he\r\ndescribed it as possessing. Sometimes I thought my great-uncle had\r\nbeen attached to some foreign mission in the mean capacity of butler,\r\nor footman, for he was scrupulous of his bow, had an excellent taste\r\nfor wine, and would spend much valuable time in bringing to light and\r\nbrushing, and then putting carefully away again, certain velvet\r\ninexpressibles of great brightness, and richly embroidered waistcoats,\r\nof wonderful length. 'These,' he would say with an air of exultation,\r\n'have a mysterious but mighty influence in changing and directing the\r\naffairs of powerful nations.' He had also a boyish fondness for\r\ndisplaying a lithograph of the Countess Hopenpap's family arms,\r\npresented, he said, by that august lady to the legation, of which he\r\nhad the honor of being a member, and from thence stolen by Thomas,\r\nfootman in ordinary to the establishment. For this heinous offence,\r\nThomas, though his knowledge of etiquette was invaluable to the\r\nmission (the gentlemen up stairs always fashioned their bows after\r\nhis!), was discharged, having been detected in the act of offering it\r\nfor sale at the counter of a dealer in old clothes.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, there was that about my great-uncle which\r\ncompletely overthrew the suspicion of his having been a kitchen\r\ndiplomatist: he was an excellent judge of dancing, and what stronger\r\nevidence of his forming one of the polite body up-stairs, does the\r\nreader want? In addition to this,--he not only discoursed glibly about\r\ndiplomacy, but sagaciously gave out that he would turn his back to no\r\none in his knowledge of treaties; which said knowledge, and his\r\ncrutch, he was always ready to swear by. Those great brass buttons\r\nwith the eagles, and his blue small clothes, too, he wore to the day\r\nof his death. The parish had a feeling that no fourth of July could be\r\ncelebrated without him; and I well remember how on that day I used to\r\nthink him rather too fond of laying his crutch over the heads of all\r\nwho differed with him on a question of state policy. My readers will\r\nplease understand that I have no particular interest in raising the\r\nquestion as to whether my great uncle got his knowledge of diplomacy\r\nup-stairs or in the kitchen. The fruits of my research would neither\r\nbe interesting here, nor serve the object I have in view. Enough is it\r\nto know that he would now and then get into a funny vein, and in the\r\noutpouring of his child-like enthusiasm, let out some exceedingly rich\r\njokes, touching the manner in which certain gentlemen paid their, to\r\nhim, most fashionable debts. And, although the old man did at first\r\nseem himself to enjoy the recital, he was as sure to end in a great\r\npassion. And with every deference to the feelings of certain of\r\nMr. Pierce's gentry, who have so recently figured upon the stage of\r\nLondon and Paris fashionable life, I may add that he would testily\r\ndeclare nothing would so please him as to cudgel every diplomatic\r\ndandy that brought disgrace upon his country abroad and left his\r\ncountrymen to bear the smart. Indeed, he once honestly admitted that\r\nforeigners were just foolish enough to look for exponents of our\r\nnational character among our representatives. If they were not\r\ninclined to form the most exalted opinion of it through that test, it\r\nwas because they never once took into consideration the nature of the\r\naccomplishments necessary to our office-holders, at the door of which\r\nthe blame lay. My great-uncle said that it was not that two or three\r\nconducted themselves in a manner unbecoming their positions, but,\r\nthat, representing us in a national capacity, they saddled the\r\nresponsibility on their honester fellow-countrymen. This, to me, had\r\nsomething about it I could not clearly understand; but I have since\r\nthought that if my eccentric uncle had lived to this day, and been in\r\npossession of his crutch, a reckoning with General Pierce had been the\r\nresult. Either he had made the splinters fly, or that worthy\r\ngentleman's ear tingle with certain facts relative to the manner in\r\nwhich his gentry have strutted upon the stage we have before\r\nmentioned. I say this of the old man because his regard for the\r\nfeelings of the nation was almost equal to his reverence for the\r\ndiplomatic body. And I am sure he, in the earnestness of his soul, had\r\nprayed Mr. Pierce to take into his pious consideration the means of\r\nremedying an evil so gross as that of his diplomatists making it the\r\nfashion of paying their debts with that sacred character the comity of\r\nnations has granted all missions. He would have told General Pierce\r\nthat he was but a man, whose little day would soon pass on the wheel\r\nof time, but that the country had a name to maintain among the\r\nnations, an exacting posterity to account to! Will his men in the\r\nbye-ways have done anything to which it may recur with pride? The\r\nstages we have twice named can answer.\r\n\r\n\"The story of Mr. Secretary Bolt, as facetiously related by my\r\ngreat-uncle, when in one of his funny moods, may not be inappropriate\r\nhere, inasmuch as it bears a strong resemblance to certain realities\r\nperpetrated at this day, but which my habitual modesty forbids me\r\ntranscribing here.\r\n\r\n'Of Bolt, morally,' my great-uncle would say, 'nothing have I to say.'\r\nThis said, he would rub his hands awhile, and then continue: 'He was\r\ncorrect of person--extremely so--had fine limbs, was tall of stature,\r\ncourtly in his movements, spoke with great preciseness, and a clear,\r\nmusical accent; had model features, was not a little vain of them, and\r\nalways employed a tailor prince, who dressed him with exact taste, but\r\nat an enormous cost. His motion, too, was as graceful as needs be;\r\nindeed nature had done well her part, lavishing on his person a goodly\r\nnumber of those endowments so necessary to a modern diplomatist, whose\r\nchief function is to ornament the drawing-room, and create a flutter\r\namong certain of the fair sex. You must understand that in Europe, as\r\nwell as America, the corps diplomatic rules the roost of fashion, and,\r\nin addition to its enrolling within its precious precincts numbers of\r\nthe legitimate aristocracy, creates a great fluttering among that of a\r\nmore doubtful hue, who seek it and worship it as the idol of their\r\nambition. It always reminded me of birds with weak minds permitting\r\nthemselves to be charmed by snakes. However, be this as it may, the\r\nknowing ones of York State (Bolt was a three-quarter blood Dutchman,\r\nand from that State!) declared it no scandal, when they said his great\r\npopularity with the ladies more than made up for his lack of law\r\nknowledge. Honester people said, if his mind was not exactly\r\nWebsterian, there could not be a doubt that nature had intended him\r\nfor the profession of diplomacy rather than one requiring more\r\nprofound thought. His make-up was unexceptionable, his smile\r\nexquisite. Then he had dark moustaches, which he would gracefully\r\nfinger into such an exact curve; and he had his small whiskers so\r\nneatly combed, and every hair on his head lay in unexceptional\r\nsmoothness. The legation was not a little proud of Bolt, and on\r\ndrawing-room days, when he blazed out in his gold lace and sword,\r\nwould delight in watching the many dark, languishing eyes that would\r\nogle him over the down of gorgeous fans. Bolt was not dead to this\r\nadmiration, for we learned, from the constant wandering of his eye,\r\nthat he rather appreciated his own popularity. For a lady to say she\r\ndid not admire Mr. Secretary Bolt, was strong evidence of her want of\r\ntaste. I do not choose to enlighten the world as to how Bolt came to\r\nbe Secretary of Legation!' Here the old man would make a desperate\r\nflourish with his crutch, by which I was led to believe that the means\r\nwere none of the cleanest; in fact that they were of a character very\r\nsimilar to those used at this day, and to which may be traced the\r\ncause of certain of Mr. Pierce's diplomatists having so distinguished\r\nthemselves in Europe. 'Zounds!' the old man would continue, testily\r\nmaking a cross on the floor with his crutch, 'a desperate set was soon\r\nmade on our Bolt by that little world of fashion and intrigue which,\r\nlizard-like, crawls about our Legations, and did more particularly so\r\nabout the one he honored with his handsome person. The Countess of\r\nLongblower, very distinguished (according to the gossip of the\r\nkitchen), and wife of the celebrated Earl of that name, took him at\r\nonce into the velvet of her good graces. Here, after a little ripening\r\nat the hands of Samuel, the polite footman in ordinary, he shone out\r\nthe star of her small but wonderfully select firmament. There were\r\nsuspicious whisperings and some scandal concerning what afterwards\r\ntook place between my lady and Bolt; but as scandal and diplomacy\r\nseemed inseparable to an European atmosphere, we as noiselessly as\r\npossible laid the charge at the door of a certain sin.' Here he would\r\nfling down his crutch. 'The Countess's carriage was forever at the\r\ndoor, waiting the pleasure of Mr. Secretary Bolt; he had a plate\r\nreserved at her table; he was the Adonis of her drawing-room; there\r\nwas a seat for him in her opera-box. In the front of the latter,\r\nfacing the stately front of her ladyship, one of her sweetest smiles\r\nforced over her hard face, sat the handsome Bolt, now playing with the\r\ntassel of her fan, then passing upon the Cavatina a sort of rosewater\r\napproval. He had a fund of small talk always at hand, and as her\r\nmightiness was extremely fond of such wares, so also did Bolt become a\r\nvery agreeable person. The Countess, too, would smile so\r\ncondescendingly, and keep up such a conversation with her eyes, now\r\nand then glancing at the Earl, who dozed at a respectful distance in\r\nthe rear. If unexpectedly he exhibited signs of consciousness, Bolt\r\nwould immediately divert the subject by passing some facetious\r\ncriticisms on the rotundity of the primadonna. And then my lady would\r\nchime in, having enjoyed her laugh: 'Your lordship never did enjoy\r\nanything.' The Earl's nap over, and the last act near its close (her\r\nhighness never condescended to remain for the vulgar ballet, and\r\ngenerally retired at the close of the fourth act), our hero would\r\ntenderly arrange her satin, make himself so polite! and then she took\r\nhis arm so condescendingly, and exchanged the sweetest glances! How\r\noften I pitied the poor Earl, as in the mightiness of his gravity he\r\nwould bring up the rear, bearing her ladyship's perfumed cambric.\r\nSeveral times a tingle of wrath came over me, and I could not resist\r\nthe thought, that had I been in the place of the poor Earl when my\r\nlady hung so rolickingly on the arm of Secretary Bolt, and sailed with\r\nsuch an affected youthfulness through the grand hall, to the no small\r\ndanger of all muslin dresses in the way, my crutch had served as a\r\nmeans to separate them. The old man, with weeping eyes, would now\r\nfinger his bandanna and resume his crutch. And then Samuel, in the\r\nfull blaze of his livery, would stand conspicuously at the grand\r\nentrance, and ere her highness's head loomed out at the top of the\r\ngreat stairs, announced her coming in a voice that seemed to strike\r\ndismay into all unliveried bystanders.'\r\n\r\n\"One thing Secretary Bolt would, do that always displeased me, as did\r\neverything that tended to lower the dignity of the corps. It was\r\nthis:--My lady loved dearly her drives in the park, and took them\r\nnearly every day, at the most fashionable hour of five. Bolt, in cloth\r\nexquisite, had always his seat at her side, where his special office\r\nseemed that of nursing her favorite poodle and smoothing the Earl, who\r\non the front seat sat with icy straightness, all over with cheap\r\ncompliments. This was all very fine as far as it went! Being proud of\r\nBolt, as I have before related, we generously overlooked in him those\r\nerrors which are rather the result of vanity than the natural\r\noffspring of an imperfect education. But we, as a nation have a worthy\r\naversion to paying a dear price for the maintenance of dignity; hence\r\nBolt, whose salary was but a paltry pittance in an atmosphere of\r\nsingular extravagance, soon found himself becoming involved for the\r\nadjuncts necessary to such a connection. A happy thought, however,\r\nsoon flashed across his mind: was he not protected by the sacred\r\ncharacter of the mission? Of course he was!--away all misgivings!\r\nWhat was the contemplation of such dreary matter to the pleasing\r\nrecollection of those fair ones whose hearts he had made flutter! And\r\nthen, not a day passed but he received no end of pretty missives,\r\nperfumed and enveloped with curiously wrought lace, and virtuous\r\nsatin,--all bearing the tenderest burdens of love and despair. Bolt\r\nwas indeed fairly set upon by rival candidates for his heart, which\r\nwas supposed to possess a large portion of susceptibility. Nor were\r\nhis admirers merely confined to the satin and velvet of the\r\naristocracy, for 'pretty Betty,' maid of all work to the Legation, and\r\non that account so vain of the honor that she would not condescend to\r\nassociate with servants not attached to the corps, was by Thomas, a\r\nwonderfully sagacious footman, discovered to be the writer of an\r\nhighly scented missive, directed as an arrow at the heart of\r\nBolt. That this little shaft of the tender passion contained some\r\ntruly original lines the enlightened cannot doubt; and I think I may\r\nassert without fear of contradiction that Betty did in these lines,\r\nnotwithstanding they evinced a sovereign contempt for orthography and\r\nversification, discover a deep knowledge of diplomacy. I say this for\r\nthe reason that her diction could be construed to mean anything but\r\nwhat she intended; albeit there was such an openness about it\r\ngenerally that any clever gentleman might walk in at the back door. I\r\nthought it highly creditable in Betty to attempt a thing so mighty as\r\nthe conquest of Bolt's heart--indeed there was an admirable heroism\r\nabout it; but it caused a great flutter in the kitchen, where the\r\nsensitive Thomas brought forward a motion for her extradition. Thomas\r\nwould not for the world have the character of gentlemen up stairs\r\nsullied by vulgar hands.\r\n\r\n\"'Bolt had scarcely reached the full blaze of his glory when a series\r\nof material obligations truly alarming commenced; and as I then\r\nregretted the manner in which he discharged them, so am I now less\r\nashamed to relate them than sorry for their existence on the page of\r\nthe past. As nearly all Bolt's acquaintances had carriages, it seemed\r\nimperative on him to follow their example, which he was not long in\r\ndoing. And this item of expense necessarily entailed that of two very\r\nworthy gentlemen--viz.: Mr. Fripp the coachman, and Mr. Still the\r\nfootman--without whom no turn-out can be considered complete. Well,\r\nthese worthy personages were put in possession of the carriage, but\r\nscarcely a week had passed before a great deficiency was discovered.\r\nMessrs. Fripp and Still had acted in similar capacities to my Lady\r\nBrackenbridge, and now declared it beneath their dignity to remain in\r\na service not honored with livery. They laid their grievance before\r\nBolt, who, appreciating the deficiency, forthwith ordered the\r\nrequisite plush and cockades, to the no small joy of those worthies.\r\nIf you ask me the cost of these adjuncts so necessary to a very fine\r\ngentleman, my answer is that I cannot enlighten you; and this for the\r\nvery reason, that the cost of an article depends very much on the\r\nmanner in which you pay for it.'\r\n\r\n\"As my great-uncle said this he would grasp tighter his crutch and\r\nlook wrathfully about the room for a seat. 'Bolt!' he would continue,\r\nhaving adjusted his shabby drab hat, 'soon learned that in Europe\r\ntradesmen are exceedingly impressible, and notwithstanding they are\r\nheld in utter contempt by the fine gentlemen of the diplomatic world,\r\nwill be their humble servant to any amount, asking no other security\r\nthan the, to them, immaculate character of the mission. I do not mean\r\nto say that Bolt made such facilities a study; nor would I be\r\nunderstood as casting a sneer at the diplomatic body in general, but\r\nwhen modern instances prove notorious facts, how can I turn a deaf ear\r\nto the belief that our diplomacy has embodied another function?--that\r\nof practising the most fashionable way of paying the most fashionable\r\ndebts. Pardon this little digression. There was a never ending demand\r\nfor Bolt's custom. Mr. Peppers, the distinguished jeweller of Regent\r\nstreet, would fill his order to any amount; Broadwood & Willow,\r\ntailors in ordinary to Her Majesty, always had a newly arrived\r\nfashion, the senior partner knew his honor would be pleased with;\r\nDole, the wine merchant, who counted his customers among the first\r\nnobility of the land, sent a list of his very best importation, humbly\r\nsoliciting an order. And as Mr. Secretary Bolt had not the least\r\nobjection to being driven into dignity, he would order all sorts of\r\nthings, from a diamond bracelet down to a tin tea-pot for Mrs.\r\nLoveleather the laundress. It was wonderful to see how credulous these\r\ntradesmen gentry were, and how they would chuckle over an order from\r\none of the legation. But I must here say that Bolt found a clever\r\ndiplomatist in Thomas, who was one of the best brought up servants in\r\nPicadilly. Thomas had no end of accomplishments, and as a certain vice\r\nin a servant is necessary to certain poor aristocracy and deeply\r\ninvolved diplomatists, so also could he lie with a facility truly\r\nincredible. If the history of Bolt's wealth, as related to certain\r\ntradesmen by Thomas, could be handed down to posterity, I fear my\r\nfriend Cresus would find himself eclipsed. This it must be borne in\r\nmind was before Thomas found himself dismissed for purloining the\r\nfamily arms of the Countess Hopenpop. And while on the subject of\r\npurloining propensities let me here say that I fear the vice of\r\nstealing family arms did not end with Thomas, but was transmitted by\r\nsome of his more fortunate brethren up stairs to certain diplomatic\r\ngentry of Mr. Pierce's choice, else how comes it that they,\r\nnotoriously plebian, made cockades and carriage doors bear strange\r\ndevices.'\r\n\r\n\"My uncle continued: 'While as many as fifty good gossipers predicted\r\ndaily the marriage of Bolt to some aristocratic belle, there came\r\nalong a lady of the name of Mrs. Bolt. This person, whose name\r\nMr. Bolt had been extremely careful not to lisp, caused a desperate\r\nsensation among his admirers. My Lady Longblower was seen to cool away\r\nlike liquid tallow, while not a few who had been equally fervent just\r\nbefore, said it was a very impertinent thing in Mr. Bolt. But as that\r\ngentleman took a more philosophical view of the matter he returned the\r\ncompliment by introducing his lady to several of those damsels who had\r\nbut a few days before themselves hoped to win his heart. Indeed the\r\narrival of Mrs. Bolt, though it brought things to a more legitimate\r\nplatform, did not in the least lessen his material responsibilities.\r\nMrs. Bolt must have more fashionable apartments; there was that\r\nsplendid diamond bracelet at Peppers'? she must have that rich honitan\r\ncape and accompaniments at Stebbin's? drawing-room day was\r\napproaching, and nothing less than one hundred and fifty guineas would\r\nsuffice to purchase the dress she would be presented in; Madame\r\nLacelooper, milliner and dressmaker to the Court, urged the necessity\r\nof her orders being in at an early day; and she must have that set of\r\nfurs at Orchard's, and Mr. Bolt must give a brilliant introduction\r\nparty. Many as were the poor fellow's previous wants Mrs. Bolt's\r\narrival seemed to increase them four-fold. Nor would it have done for\r\nhim to have intimated a necessity for retrenchment, inasmuch as she\r\nwas equally determined to keep up the dignity of the establishment,\r\nand would not hear a word about limitation in anything. The poor\r\nfellow now began to think a time was coming when his diplomacy would\r\nbe put to the test. He, too, had an eye to a little popularity at\r\nhome, liked to be thought well of by his fellow-citizens, who, when\r\nabroad invariably want to see all the sights and dine with their\r\nMinister, and to that end gave them dinners and sundry other little\r\nthings. Everything except his salary Bolt found enlarged, and as his\r\ntime had been principally taken up with the issuing of orders, so was\r\nit thereafter to be arranging certain payments. Isaacs, the Hebrew\r\ngentleman who took corners of advance checks for the convenience of\r\nhis very aristocratic friends was seen frequently about the premises,\r\nlooking very serious. Six months passed and circumstances were changed\r\nwith Bolt. The Countess Longblower no longer permitted him to sit at\r\nher side and play with the poodle; his fair admirers had lost all\r\ntheir compliments; and it became absolutely necessary that Mrs. Bolt\r\nreturn to the more humble precincts of her home on the other side of\r\nthe water. When Peppers called for that trifle of ninety-seven\r\nguineas--pay for that necklace that shone so about Mrs. Bolt's neck\r\nwhen at Court--it was curious to see how the genius of Mr. Bolt would\r\ncome out; and how in conjunction with Thomas' sagacity quite a comedy\r\nof sharps would be played. Thomas tended door, was rather sleepy of\r\ncountenance, but could assume an air of great consequence, and would\r\nreceive his importuning visitor with unexceptional bows. 'Peppers I\r\nthink you said?' Thomas would politely inquire, smoothing his chin\r\nreflectively, giving his ear a knowing cant, and concluding by\r\nwhisking his fingers through his powdered hair. 'Mr. Peppers presents\r\na little affair this morning;' he would announce blandly, having left\r\nthe gentleman standing in the hall. Mr. Bolt, who occupied a sumptuous\r\narm-chair in the parlor, and generally sat reading leisurely the\r\nMorning Post, would receive this announcement with some change of\r\ncountenance. 'Peppers! Peppers!' he would reiterate, Thomas watching\r\nhis every movement. 'Blast the fellow--he's a perfect torment'--Thomas\r\nwould interrupt by inquiring if he should bow the individual out.\r\n'Say, Thomas,' he would rejoin, 'that we are engaged to-day studying\r\ntreaties and cannot be disturbed--that he must call at a future day.'\r\nMr. Bolt would with great complacency, turn to a more comfortable\r\nposition in his great chair. Thomas always executed his mission with\r\ngreat skill, informing the unfortunate individual that a little\r\nmisunderstanding having broken out between the two nations, the\r\nLegation was extremely busy in the study of treaties, and could not be\r\ndisturbed. Having digested this piece of information rather doggedly,\r\nMr. Thomas would politely bow the gentleman into the street, watching\r\nhis departure through the side lights. Another time, when Broadwood\r\ncalled for that trifle, having a deal of ready money to make up, it\r\nwas despatch day; and upon the same principle despatch day came so\r\noften that people began to think the Great Republic engaged in one\r\neternal controversy with the nations of Europe. Bolt never could be\r\nseen on despatch days. The man with the bill for the tin-teapot was\r\nalike unsuccessful; the gentlemen up-stairs walled themselves up in\r\ndespatch days, while Thomas politely bowed out all-importuners. They\r\nwere a scurvy lot, and might have known better! Mr. Bolt thought, as\r\nhe contemplated the sacred character of the mission. I well remember\r\nhow I laughed once, when Madame Lacelooper's man of business drove\r\nMr. Secretary Bolt, as I thought, into close quarters. Thomas, in\r\norder to somewhat diversify his apologies, had three different times\r\nsatisfied this person by informing him that the gentlemen of the\r\nLegation were in consultation with the Prime Minister; but this time\r\nhe was determined to see for himself, and regardless of Thomas'\r\nassurance pushed his way into the presence of Mr. Bolt, who I need\r\nscarcely add was extremely put out. 'I ask your honor's pardon' spoke\r\nthe man; 'you always come,' petulantly interrupted our hero, 'when we\r\nare in a uproar.' The man replied with a bow, that it was the first\r\ntime he had gained an audience. He came from Madame Lacelooper's, and\r\nwould be extremely glad if Mr. Bolt could make it convenient to\r\ndischarge that little account, which had stood over for some time. It\r\nwas only two hundred and fourteen pounds, he said, in reply to a\r\nquestion from Mr. Bolt, who encouragingly took the missive from his\r\nhand. 'Thank you--thank you!' the man continued, evidently encouraged\r\nas our hero cast his eye over the long list of items, so neatly\r\ncarried out with heavy numbers of pounds, shillings, and\r\npence. 'Rather heavy;' sighed the astonished Secretary. 'I suppose you\r\nhave orders for all these little affairs?'  The man replied that he\r\nwould have them forthcoming if necessary--that Madame Lacelooper's was\r\none of the most respectable establishments.  With a gracious bow,\r\nreaching his hand for a book which the expectant gentleman mistook for\r\na bank-book, Mr. Bolt replied that it was on that account he gave it\r\nhis patronage. The gentleman thanked him for the honor, and hoped he\r\nwould continue his favors. And while this little episode was\r\nperforming in the great parlour, Mr. Thomas was exercising his skill\r\nin diplomacy at the door--informing gentlemen that Mr. Bolt was\r\nengaged over important State affairs, and politely bowing them out.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then Mr. Bolt having worked the gentleman's anxiety up to the\r\nhighest pitch, would take up his great gold pen, and on a piece of\r\nwhitest paper, figure, and figure, and figure, multiply and subtract,\r\ncontort his face and nervously frisk his fingers through his curly\r\nblack hair. It was all to no purpose, however he could not twist the\r\nplaguy figures into a favorable balance. In fact the balance, despite\r\nall his diplomacy, would get on the wrong page. At length, having\r\nexhausted patience and found language to adapt himself to\r\ncircumstances, with great blandness of manner he would beg the\r\ngentleman, convey his compliments to Madame Lacelooper, and say that\r\nher little matter will be discharged at a future day. His balance, he\r\nwas surprised to find, did not enable him to meet it today; and he\r\nfurther regretted that a very disagreeable affair having sprung up\r\nbetween the Emperor of the French and his government, requiring for a\r\nfew days all the attention of the establishment, deprived him of the\r\nopportunity of repairing to his banker's for the purpose of enlarging\r\nhis deposit. Ordering an attendant to bring in the treaties of 1812,\r\nhe added how sorry he was to give Madame Lacelooper, for whom he\r\nentertained the highest regard, so much trouble. Legations were\r\npeculiarly situated at times, he said. In reply to an intimation from\r\nthe gentleman in waiting, he said, gentlemen of the diplomatic corps\r\nnever paid in piecemeal. Here Thomas would put an end to the comedy by\r\nannouncing the arrival of the '_Minister for Foreign Affairs_,' and\r\npolitely bowing out the retiring gentleman, who, you may well imagine,\r\nmaintained a reluctant gravity. There was no end of these little\r\ndiplomatic comediettas, while Bolt honored the mission with his\r\npresence, ending in what was long afterwards esteemed a capital joke,\r\nwhich, though somewhat against my feelings, I will confidentially\r\nrelate. Bolt had named a certain day when all his little affairs would\r\npositively be arranged, and this dawned of a calm and sunny autumn\r\nmorning, when everything about the Legation seemed to repose in peace\r\nand quietness--when wars and obdurate creditors were forgotten, and we\r\nplumed ourselves on the happy issue of several important international\r\nquestions. One very important member of the corps, however, seemed to\r\nhave something of great importance evolving in his mind; this was the\r\nsagacious Thomas, who paced the hall with more than ordinary\r\nsuperciliousness, now and then arranging his livery in the\r\nmirror. About eleven o'clock there came a great gathering of\r\nserious-looking individuals at the hall door; among them the quick eye\r\nof Thomas discovered the following very respectable gentlemen,\r\nviz.:--Broadwood, of the firm of Broadwood & Willow; Dole, the\r\ndistinguished wine merchant; Staple, the bootmaker; Madame\r\nLacelooper's man of business; and Peppers, the jeweller. The opening\r\nof the door was succeeded by a great rush. Having expressed some\r\nsurprise at their mistake in calling so early, Thomas received his\r\nvisitors with his customary equanimity, and begged to remind them that\r\nthree o'clock was the hour appointed for the interview between\r\nthemselves and Mr. Bolt. Here he threw a sly wink at Peppers, which\r\nthat gentleman rendered into an intimation to remain, while he\r\npolitely bowed the remainder out. 'Wonderful assurance, these fellows\r\nhave,' said Thomas, turning to Peppers, who began to think he was all\r\nright, 'they won't learn etiquette.' As he concluded he turned to have\r\na view through the side-light at his friends outside, who hung\r\ncontemplatively about the door, then addressing the inside\r\ngentleman--'Peppers, I think you said?' he continued, working his lips\r\nand smoothing his chin with the fingers of his right hand. That\r\ngentleman bowed affirmatively as Thomas advanced a few steps toward\r\nthe parlor door, and then hesitated, as if in a deep study. 'Peppers,\r\nPeppers, Peppers!' he accented somewhat curiously, until the creditor\r\nhad well nigh lost his patience in suspense. 'I beg your pardon, sir!'\r\n(Thomas faced about with an entirely altered face), but, may I,\r\nah!--hem,--you see; there is a small affair in the way, Mr. Peppers.\r\nThe truth is, Mr. Bolt has ceased his connection with this\r\nestablishment.'\r\n\r\n\"'I must see him, nevertheless,' replied the obdurate creditor,\r\npermitting his suspicions to get the better of his judgment. 'If you\r\ndo,' rejoined Thomas, bowing, 'you may have a longer drive than is\r\nagreeable at this season of the year.'\r\n\r\n\"'You don't mean to tell me that he has left?' demanded Peppers,\r\nstamping his foot, and allowing himself to become generally excited.\r\n'Now, my friend,' Thomas replied in the coolness of his nature, making\r\na motion to open the street door, 'just take the matter like a\r\nphilosopher; don't let such little affairs trouble a man of your\r\nstanding. The fact is, between the sundown of one day, and rosy dawn\r\nof another, our gallant Secretary just stepped out--that is, Mr. Bolt\r\nhas bolted!' Thomas bowed him politely out, and I leave you to judge\r\nhow many indignant threats were thrown out by Peppers, and what\r\noccurred when he related the climax to his fellow-creditors, who\r\nhaving a suspicion that all was not right, waited his appearance among\r\nthem at the corner of an adjacent street, against the lamp-post of\r\nwhich they entered a protest deep and solemn. My great-uncle having\r\nconcluded his story, adjusted his crutch, wiped his weeping eyes,\r\nrelieved his hoarseness with a small quantity of temperance bitters,\r\nand limped away.\r\n\r\n[Note I.--The chapter is respectfully dedicated to General Pierce.]\r\n\r\n[Note II.--The fastidious--I mean those rather inclined to facts, may,\r\nto please their peculiar taste, transfer the scene of Mr. Secretary\r\nBolt's exploits to Paris; they may also add a date more modern.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nHOW SMOOTH GOT HIS MANNERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Readers, and fellow citizens of these United States in general! know\r\nye, that I, Solomon Smooth, in the first person singular, as Uncle Sam\r\nHouston used to say, being worn out with the fatigues of the\r\nOstend-Aix-la-Chapelle Congress, crossed the Atlantic in two\r\nsteamships--wanted to do both a good turn--got busted up by\r\nneither--and at last found myself calmly luxuriating in the velvet and\r\ndamask of the 'White House.' By way of keeping up the spirit of Young\r\nAmerica, I knocked down all the attendants, stalked in like an\r\nindependent citizen who felt he was part owner of the establishment,\r\nspread myself upon the softest sofa, and demanded the flunkey, who\r\nstood trembling in the doorway, to bring me a Turkey ottoman, on which\r\nto advantageously take the measure of my extremes. Believe me, Sam, I\r\nwent it in the way of comforts. The flunkey shook his head, and kept\r\nup a significant silence. This was rather too much for the patience of\r\nany respectable gentleman; and being aware that the Gineral had not\r\nlarned him proper manners, I got up and brought it myself. Nor yet did\r\nit seem just the thing--something was wanting to complete the\r\nfree-and-easy, to which end I pulled out a real Havana regalia, and\r\npuffed away so comfortably. Then I ordered the flunkey, whose hair was\r\nseen stiffening on his head with fright, to bring me a spittoon--felt\r\nsorry I neglected to import one from some of our European\r\nLegations!--or I'd hurl the liquid every which way--perhaps storm his\r\nhigh-colored Persian rugs! I was about to lay off in the very bliss of\r\ncomfort, when Pierce, followed by his black pig, came laraping into\r\nthe room, looking as amiable and undecided as ever. 'Smooth,' he\r\nexclaimed, greeting me with a heartiness of hand little expected, 'I\r\nam so glad to see you home once more!' Here he suddenly paused, gave\r\nout ominous looks, lowered his voice to a whisper, and continued: 'In\r\nthe name of forgiveness, where did you contract such manners?' A\r\nlittle cold sweat bespread his brow just then. 'Upon the faith of my\r\nhigh position,' he continued, 'I thought my sending you to Europe\r\nwould have proved a polishing machine, and prepared you for shining in\r\nsociety.'\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Smooth,' I modestly returned, 'would prefer the General sat down\r\nand calmly listen to how he came by his pretty manners. Somebody has\r\nsaid, a man was known by the society he keeps. Be this as it may,\r\nGeneral, I don't come here to cast a single reflection on you; nor\r\nwould I proclaim to the fellow citizens of these United States that\r\nyou are in any wise accountable for what I am going to say and\r\ndisclose.' The General, somewhat struck by my demeanor, took a seat,\r\nnervously, and applied his ear, while I extinguished the cigar, and\r\ncommenced summoning my thoughts. 'Having no manners when I left home,\r\nGeneral, I naturally depended for them upon those whom my mission\r\nbrought me in contact with. Now, General!--and this I would were held\r\nstrictly confidential between ourselves--when I got on the other side\r\nof the water, (here I gave him a touch he understood), being your\r\nMinister in General I naturally fell in and associated with your\r\nMinisters in particular; and such a lot they were! I couldn't trust my\r\nvirtue in the company of one of them: albeit, in their company, you\r\nwere sure not to get into decent society. Foreign victims of\r\nmisgovernment had long viewed America as a land from whence came the\r\nplain unostentatious gentleman of sense. How sad to think that they\r\nhad of late been so grievously disappointed! They are only men of\r\ncoarse manners, and low of bringing up, assuming the democrat, while\r\naping the snobism of the aristocrat. General, they are of your own\r\nselecting; and, mark me, I only name it here out of sincere regard for\r\nyou, not expecting it to get abroad. In fact, General, the people of\r\nEurope find they have been deluded. They see us affecting contempt for\r\nthe very fooleries we seek to imitate; they see these, your chosen,\r\nplaying the coarse ruffian to the end. To the foreign mind Americans\r\nare America--to its chosen they look for the embodiment of its\r\ninstitutions It cannot comprehend that the mongrel-mixture you have\r\nsent abroad constitute the very essence of that ill opinion gained of\r\nus by misrepresentation. This, General, is strictly private--only\r\nintended for your own good. It were folly to look for pretty manners\r\nin me after my connection with your chosen on the continent of Europe!\r\nIn London I found things all in a fuddle,--the head of the house\r\nhaving dwindled into obscurity, while the juniors had been in all\r\nsorts of business but that for which they had been paid and sent to\r\ndischarge; indeed, the revolutionary business, into which members of\r\nthe house had largely entered, had brought it into all sorts of\r\ndifficulties and disgraces. Again it was currently reported that, for\r\nbeing too deeply engaged in the affairs of others, two of the smaller\r\nfunctionaries had found themselves locked up in a police-station, and\r\nonly unlocked themselves with that protection which the sacred\r\ncharacter of the mission is supposed to grant:--in fact, General, and\r\nI advance the intimation for your own good, the only thing in real\r\ngood order was the smoking and spitting department. In Paris the house\r\nwas a dead lock, inasmuch as the head couldn't understand a word the\r\nFrench said, either about himself or his government; while the retinue\r\nwere all familiarly known at the cafes. In Madrid, the head of the\r\nhouse, not having the value of discretion before his eyes, had fuzzled\r\naway all his influence, having fought sundry duels, written himself\r\ndown an ass in controversy with editors, and failed in his proposal to\r\nbuild up a young republic on the ruins of an old and dissolute\r\nmonarchy. Forcibly as the truth may depict our singular\r\nmisrepresentation abroad, we cannot forbear to say, that, so far did\r\nthis very French-American representative carry his fighting\r\nproclivities, that a single instance of their being excelled--our\r\nfighting London Secretary, who had challenged a score of very aged\r\ngentlemen (and had been equally courageous were they double the age!)\r\nwithout finding a single one to accept--could not be found. At the\r\nHague, the very respectable Hebrew gentleman, who conducted the\r\naffairs of the house, had opened a barber-shop, where needy gentlemen\r\ncould be shaved _ad libitum_--provided always they brought a certain\r\ndescription of notes, nor were dainty about how much were taken off\r\nthe corner. The house at Lisbon, report said, had got into very\r\norderly disorder, which was not in accordance with the character of\r\nthe very respectable Irish gentleman who kept it, and who could absorb\r\nwhiskey and tobacco with any other respectable gentleman from\r\nKilkenny. To the denizens, among whom he had made an extensive\r\nacquaintance, his being an American and speaking such very good Irish\r\nand bad English was a perfect mystery. You may be sure he likes well\r\nhis situation, and finds the duties of a Minister Extraordinary much\r\npreferable to leading the retreat of a _pampero_ expedition.' Here the\r\nGeneral significantly opened one eye and shut the other: 'Only telling\r\nyou this for your own good' I watched him anxiously as he grasped me\r\nby the hand, and replied: 'Smooth! the boldest stroke in my\r\nadministration does not please me so much as sending you Minister in\r\nGeneral to Europe. But can half you say be true?'\r\n\r\n\"'True?' I rejoined--'too true for delicate ears! General, you may\r\naccept my word when I say it is not so much the public duties as the\r\nprivate affairs of men you have got to keep a close eye upon; when the\r\nprivate affairs of public men get astray the public suffers: this is\r\nborne out in the result of your having appointed foreign gentlemen to\r\nmisrepresent us abroad. Your house at Turin is fashionable, but sorely\r\nscandalized; the people there love the _fair_, but expect fairer\r\nthings of Americans. Your son of Moses, who plays so well his part at\r\nAlexandria, is a bird vain of his feather, and may to-day be seen\r\ncarried through the streets in something resembling a clothes-basket,\r\nand to-morrow in the market purchasing Nubian slaves fair to look\r\nupon. These things may be necessary to a very fine gentleman in\r\nAlexandria; but the being who performs them at the expense of his\r\ncountry well earns the pity of its people. And while I am on this\r\ntheme, General, I cannot in justice pass over one whom I say in all\r\nseriousness has, when contrasted with others, won for himself immortal\r\nhonors; I mean our worthy representative at St. Petersburg, who\r\nunderstanding no language but his own, and that very imperfectly, has\r\nthe great good sense to say nothing, seclude himself from the society\r\nof the Czar, and seek only the enjoyment of his own melancholy\r\ncontemplations. Now General; however much you may esteem the doings of\r\nyour chosen, there is in Europe but one opinion of their manners; and\r\nthat opinion being, I regret to say, not the very highest, will for\r\nsome time to come measure our influence at sundry Courts. I got my\r\nmanners, General, by mixing with your chosen!' The General here drew a\r\nlong breath, said dinner was almost ready; would I not change the\r\nsubject, and talk about the war business, and such things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMR. SMOOTH PROPOSES TAKING MR. PIERCE'S FIGHTING BY THE JOB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Smooth, a young man of the fast school, has been calculating,\r\nduring his tour in Europe, the saving it would be to nations if they\r\nwould but let their wars out by the job to some enterprising\r\nfellow-citizen. He reckons, in a funny sort of way, he would then pay\r\njust in accordance to the amount and quality of thrashing it were\r\nnecessary to inflict upon the enemy. That it would divest war of its\r\nglories, and ambitious men of their zeal, he never had a doubt. War\r\ntaken by the job, at a given sum for thrashing the enemy right\r\nsoundly, would resolve itself into a mere trading commodity, fit only\r\nto be dabbled in by shopkeepers and stockbrokers. By this turn in\r\nnational affairs, Kings and Czars might curtail their ambition, and\r\ntheir devoted subjects, being paid to fight by the lump, would hurry\r\nthrough their contract. General Pierce, too, would find it decidedly\r\nmore convenient, inasmuch as it would save his benevolent people the\r\ntrouble of inflicting that most unwarrantable rebuke--sending bread to\r\nthe hungry people at Greytown he has made homeless with his\r\nbombshells. Smooth leans no disrespect to Mr. President Pierce, who,\r\nsince his wondrous victory over the Mosquitoes, has disappointed the\r\nworld by demonstrating the singular fact that he has a gunpowder\r\npolicy, which he developes when he can find objects sufficiently small\r\nfor his purposes. Heretofore, Smooth had got an idea in his head\r\n(crosswise he admits), that if Mr. President Pierce had anything\r\nassimilating to a policy, it must be like his grandmother's hard\r\ncider--the longer it remained exposed the flatter it became. That this\r\nwas an egregious mistake, is fully proven to a mistaken world by the\r\ndauntless and immortal Admiral Hollins (he should be promoted to the\r\nrank), who, to give positive evidence of the size of his master's\r\nspirit, just battered down a defenseless town or two. It may turn out\r\nthat the bombshelling was only to practice a little in that sort of\r\ngunnery, and that using up the property of American citizens to\r\nillustrate the war principles of Uncle Sam was merely an evidence of\r\nspunk in Mr. Pierce, who expected his people to knock under.\r\n\r\n\"Smooth has been at the White House, seeing Mr. Pierce, and cautioning\r\nhim about the look of things abroad, lest they get kind of snarled up.\r\n\r\n\"Being a genuine New Englander, with real Puritanic blood in his\r\ncomposition, Smooth considered himself a good sort of man,--rather a\r\ndesirable neighbor, conscientious, extremely disinterested, and always\r\nready to do a bit of a good turn, never forgetting number one. Smooth\r\nwas just going to ask the Gineral if this was not so, when he smiled\r\nso free and easy that it settled the point shorter.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, Smooth, you've seen a good deal, I reckon, and must be a man of\r\nprofound opinions: tell us, are we going to get fuzzled up in the\r\nbreakers on the other side of the big pond?' inquired the Gineral,\r\nlooking so serious that Smooth made it a point to get his ideas\r\nsquared up.\r\n\r\n\"'Somethin for us citizens to have a go-in-at, you means, I s'pose?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes!' replied the Gineral.\r\n\r\n\"Smooth reckoned 'twas best to have an understanding about how much he\r\nwas going to get from Uncle Sam's chink-locker for doing the thrashing\r\nfor these United States afore he said much about what was going on in\r\nthe world. Uncle Sam was a good old soul, and, seeing that he did not\r\nkeep the best cash account in the world, Smooth had no objection to\r\nentering into the tin business with him, now that he had a large stock\r\non hand. Smooth, however, must make one single proviso, and that is,\r\nthat he be always permitted to work out the p's and q's of his own\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah!' replied the Gineral, good-naturedly; 'Smooth, you're a sharp\r\nfellow, with gumption enough to see through a thing or two; but\r\nremember, if we contract for the licking, with some enterprising\r\nindividual, we must pay by measurement. There's the democracy to\r\nplease, the country to satisfy, Young America to provide with clean\r\nshirts! I thought my gallant fellow Hollins would have done that when\r\nI sent him to _let strip_ at the Greytowners; but, as the result was\r\ndifferent, a body can't always tell how such things 'll turn, I now\r\nthink of letting him out to the Emperor of Russia, who having granted\r\nhim means of developing his fighting capacity, by investing him with\r\nfull power to thrash the allied fleets of England and France, would\r\nnot hesitate to pay a large amount of revenue into the treasury of\r\nthese United States for his daring services. But you see, Smooth, my\r\ngovernment is merely an experiment, which may or may not please, and\r\nin this sense your experience will be extremely valuable.'\r\n\r\n\"Smooth saw Mr. President Pierce wanted experience; but, at the same\r\ntime, he was fearful the General would get the points, and out-general\r\nhim. However, as it was always better to have confidence in each other\r\nwhen pursuing a political question, and knowing the General to be a\r\nsort of clever fellow, ready to do almost anything, he entered upon\r\nthe decyphering. There was the S.S.S. (Sickles, Souley, and Saunders)\r\nCompany, doing a slap-up business in Europe! He must have them thrown\r\nin. While the head of the firm was generously lending a hand to turn\r\nmother monarchy out of doors, and the in-door partner was making sad\r\nuse of the stock in trade (which consisted of a very large supply of\r\nletter-writing material, only to be used for disseminating republican\r\nprinciples), the junior of the house, taking advantage of the\r\nopportune moment, thought it quite in keeping with the spirit of the\r\ntimes to make a spec on his own account; and to that end the said\r\njunior partner (not the least sagacious of the three), with a bill of\r\nsale of Cuba in his pocket, had just stepped over to Washington to\r\nconsummate the purchase, and revel awhile in the damask of the White\r\nHouse. Borland, finding no more congressional faces to smash in\r\nWashington--from which city it was considered General Pierce had\r\nremoved an intolerable perplexity by sending him to foreign parts--had\r\nbeen recompensed by the smashing of his own, in Central America, where\r\nhe had raised a tolerable sort of a breeze. He, too, must be thrown\r\nin. Seymour, the blue-stocking governor, of whom so much was expected,\r\nand whose mission to the god of all the Rushas, American statesmen\r\nlooked upon with great anxiety, it was currently reported had burrowed\r\nin a snow-bank somewhere in the interior of the amiable Czar's vast\r\ndominions, not one word having been heard of him for the last nine\r\nmonths. That he had not lent material aid to the fighting Cossack, was\r\na source of grievous dissatisfaction to Young America.\r\n\r\n\"Smooth spread all these things out before the Gineral, just as clear\r\nas water. To get Cuba--which was not just ready to hook on--and\r\nSt. Domingo, that it would take some nice diplomacy to make consider\r\nthe annexation question, and a few slices more of Mexico, ready to\r\nmake fast any moment; the Sandwich Islands, yearning to get in;\r\nCentral America, hardly worth taking in, but nevertheless acceptable,\r\non the ground of carrying out the universal plan, and Canada only\r\nrequiring a little more coaxing, Smooth thought the cost could be\r\nreckoned down to a close figure. But there was Uncle Johnny, and his\r\nnewly-coined friend Louis Napoleon, to be kept shy while all this was\r\ngoing on; and just there the plague and expense of the thing hung.\r\nHowever, Smooth scratched his head, and made up his mind to enter into\r\na bargain to do the licking at a fair showing, cash down. As to the\r\nbrush between Nicholas and his neighbor--unhappy wretches; one always\r\nwanting to steal the bits of stray territory--Smooth found it painful\r\nto keep his fingers out; but there was this to be taken into\r\nconsideration: the getting his fingers in might be the getting out of\r\nhis commerce, which said commerce was the model machine of the Model\r\nRepublic's power.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President Pierce fully believed that Nicholas of all the Rushas\r\nhad got his eye set to the East, notwithstanding he had quite enough\r\nto do in the West; and, though he declared himself moved only by\r\nchristian visions, it seemed curious enough that he had not the\r\nslightest objection to raising most un-christian wars. Nicholas was\r\nshrewder than a Connecticut tin pedlar, and more ambitious than a\r\nSouth Carolina politician, who, ever and anon, is ready to war with\r\nthe Britishers, because the _fools_ obstinately refused to admire\r\nslavery. Nicholas had got himself into an interminable fix. Mr.\r\nPierce, merely to please the youthful democracy, would like to lend\r\nNick a hand to unfix himself, but the hitherto dormant power of the\r\nnation quickens to action, and says, 'It won't do, Mr. General\r\nPierce!' Forced to submit, the General consoles himself with the fact\r\nthat his friend Nicholas will draw himself into his invulnerable\r\nshell, sing the Te Deums, and trust the fate of war, for a dozen years\r\nor so, to the All-wise Father.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, Gineral,' said Smooth, addressing himself to Mr. President\r\nPierce, 'the items are all down!--there will be warm work, depend upon\r\nit!--and seeing how Uncle Sam'll have to scratch in somewhere (just to\r\nmake a point or two), Cousin Caleb and me will take the job of doing\r\nall the necessary fighting on both sides the big pond, and getting all\r\nthe stray territory required to complete these United States, for\r\neighty-six million dollars--two and a half per cent. off for ready\r\nmoney. Might as well let Smooth have the shiners, seeing how me and\r\nCaleb would give security to do the fighting up brown; and. then\r\nsomebody was getting the tin out of Uncle Sam's big bag in a fast kind\r\nof way that nobody could explain. Smooth begged Mr. President Pierce\r\nto give the thing a few turns over in his head, and when the problem\r\ncame as clear as daylight, send him his figure by the first post.'\r\nWith this, Mr. Smooth retired to the National.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMR. PIERCE SENDS SMOOTH DOWN AMONG THE BRITISHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Smooth (I write after the style most in fashion), having been\r\nassociated with Mr. Pierce, whose Minister in general he was, as has\r\nbeen set forth in this history, is come to be regarded as a very\r\ndangerous individual. It is astonishing with what facility we gain bad\r\nrepute from association with a certain class of men and things. Our\r\ncountry is a stalwart oasis, rising in reproachful greatness over the\r\nold and dwindling dependencies around it; but our Pierce government is\r\na waste in its centre, contaminating and casting the blight of\r\nintrigue upon those connected with it. It builds bulwarks for itself,\r\nand breaks them down with the mere fog of its own breakers. It, like a\r\ndauntless boy, seizes the helm of State, and steering by scheme\r\ninstead of compass, runs the ship ashore in unknown seas. As Smooth is\r\na national Christian, he believes the timbers of the old ship tough\r\nand strong, or they had been bilged ere this. But, while speaking of\r\ncontamination in connection with Mr. Pierce, he (Smooth) is forcibly\r\nreminded of the similarity between it and an episode in the life of\r\nhis great-grandfather. This venerable ancestor, when fine society was\r\nless tenacious of its associations, entered upon the cultivation of\r\npumpkins as a business, but in after life, as the novelist has it,\r\nbecame a railroad president, and as an inseparable result, a great\r\nfinancier. When in the latter position, being a very sensitive person,\r\nhe tried to get rid of the odor of the pumpkin business; but all to no\r\npurpose. Do what he would, go where he would, contribute to what he\r\nwould, mix with what society he would, be as generous as he would,\r\npeople were heard to whisper 'pumpkins;' and to construe his motives\r\nas prompted by the same spirit which induced him to make a business of\r\ncultivating that vegetable. A similar odor, arising from his\r\nconnection with Pierce, Smooth found clinging to his garments. The\r\nworld in general viewed him as a dangerous man, for the simple reason\r\nthat his master was regarded with the same eye of suspicion. Pierce\r\nwas not ignorant of this, and to obviate Smooth's difficulties, said\r\nhe would send him Down East, as before related. Being of an undecided\r\nturn, he could not make up his mind about the war business in Europe,\r\nnor could he exactly define where he stood with regard to Central\r\nAmerica. He would like to give me (Smooth) the job to do the fighting\r\nfor these United States, for he felt sure I could not fail to make a\r\ngrand affair of it. As for Caleb being taken into the contract (he,\r\nthe General, shook his head doubtingly), he had some doubt of the\r\npolicy; he was fast enough, but there was no knowing which way he\r\nwould turn at any moment, nor was he at all times to be trusted. For\r\nthe present, Smooth must be contented with a first-class mission to\r\nDown East, where he would settle the fish and other questions\r\ninternational; at the same time, he might be evolving in his mind the\r\naffair of the war. Did Minister Smooth deem it expedient, he might\r\nwithout prejudice, taking the Ostend for example, call together on the\r\nIsland of St. Paul--or, if preferable, the Isle of Sables--a Congress\r\nof American Ministers, provided, nevertheless, he invite Major Hammet,\r\nof the Pictou Mission, and Governor Darby, of the Isle of Dogs. Pierce\r\nstrictly enjoined that no letters be received from Monsieur Souley,\r\nnor his dogmatic Secretary, and that the subjects to be discussed were\r\nthe internal affairs of Baffin's Bay, Greenland, the North Pole, the\r\nLabrador Coast, and the straits of Bell Isle--from which the\r\nimportation of cod oil had sadly fallen off during our fish\r\ndifficulties. Not to weary the reader, Smooth is here happy to relieve\r\nhis mind by stating that simple prudence restrained him from calling\r\ntogether this august Congress; he left it where he found it--in\r\nMr. Pierce's fruitful head.\r\n\r\n\"Conscious of the necessity, Smooth bound Mr. Pierce down to detail,\r\nparticularly stipulating that he should bear the ultimate\r\nresponsibility in the event of failure. Now to the result!\r\n\r\n\"His opinion of the Novascotians had always been favorable, and when\r\nhe left Mr. Pierce it was with a promise that he would do all he could\r\nto enlighten them. But as impressions will change at a nearer view, so\r\nwhen he got wrong did he regard both the quality and quantity of their\r\nradicalism as injurious to the best interests of the State. There was\r\nin the little green-hilled province an endless amount of political\r\ntalking done, with so small an amount of patriotism evinced, that we\r\nwere not at a loss for the cause that had kept the State in\r\nobscurity. Then there seemed so much government, that everything was\r\nungoverned. And he (Smooth) thought there was a want of activity,\r\nphysical as well as mental, and a recklessness of getting into debt to\r\nMr. John Bull, who never could infuse a sufficient sense of honor into\r\nhis Colonial subjects to make them pay over, or regard their\r\nobligations. Want of energy and a criminal dependence upon the 'home\r\nGovernment' for assistance, with which to develop the resources of the\r\ncountry, resulted in a want of confidence in the State's own means to\r\nbetter its condition. The Home Government, and an imported Governor,\r\nwere blighting to their vital energies. This subject, however, is not\r\nfruitful, hence his reader will please accompany him to a different.\r\nHaving left Pierce for a time, Smooth, with that resolution so\r\ncharacteristic of his countrymen, wherever found, entered into the\r\ncodfish business. Transforming himself (after the manner of his uncle\r\nJeff Davis), into a captain of the fishing schooner Starlight, which\r\nsaid schooner he ran over the treaty line straight into Fox Island, on\r\nthe coast of Cape Breton, where he proposed making the acquaintance of\r\nthe inhabitants, and, if possible, a treaty of friendship and\r\ncommerce. The waters in and about the port were alive with\r\nmackerel--the finest, plumpest, fattest, and most willing fish ever\r\nseen in any waters. They sported round us, looking clever enough to\r\nmake all on board the schooner believe they wanted to come on board.\r\nThe crew felt like scraping acquaintance with them, favoring them with\r\na hook, and the like; but then there interposed that great\r\nbugbear--the treaty line. Hard was it to tell where this line was; it\r\nmight, for aught to the contrary, be on the top of a wave, upon which\r\nwe might be tossed, much against Smooth's inclination, far into the\r\nunlawful side. Being, however, inside of the line and surrounded by\r\nmackerel, one would have supposed the Nova Scotians had been on the\r\nalert catching them. The case was just the reverse, for not a Nova\r\nScotiaman was to be seen. To Smooth's mind this was making a law to\r\nprotect the lazy, something he never approved of, more especially in\r\nthese days of energy and railroads. A determination was come to, after\r\nmature deliberation, that fish there were and fish our boys must have,\r\nso you must lend an ear while Smooth relates the manner in which he\r\ngot them. Deacon Hawkins kept an inn for the entertainment of man and\r\nbeast. It was not the very best kind of an inn, for it was managed by\r\nthe deacon's wife, whose parsimony and love of Friday evening meetings\r\nhad lost her nearly all her guests and driven her children barefoot\r\ninto the street. On the day following the Starlight's arrival, as luck\r\nwould have it, a 'political meeting' was to be holden at the Deacon's,\r\nwhen a considerable amount of first-rate drinking was sure to come\r\noff. Smooth, being Mr. Pierce's minister in general, was honored with\r\nan invitation which he declined in consideration of his anxiety to be\r\namong the mackerel. Something must indeed be done for the mackerel;\r\nthe case was a serious one. Had the Britishers shown a resolution to\r\nbe among the fish, Smooth had lent them a hand to secure the whole\r\nshoal, and then brought them back, merely to avoid the penalty of the\r\nBritish law, and secure the bounty given by ours. Well, the Britishers\r\nwere all gone to a political meeting, where a noisy politician of the\r\nname of Joe Howe, and another of the name of Doyle, having come all\r\nthe way from Halifax, and brought with them other great men of the\r\npolitical world of Nova Scotia, would relieve themselves of ponderous\r\nspeeches, to hear which all the old men of the parish would take their\r\npromising sons. Smooth never regarded political meetings over highly,\r\nand had more than once thought those so earnest in attending them had\r\ndone much better attending their potato fields. With this opinion made\r\nstronger in the present instance, he counselled Mister Splitwater, the\r\nmate, whose logic never was known to be at fault. Splitwater, agreed\r\nthat it was expedient to be in pursuit of the fish while the\r\nBritishers were attending their political gatherings and\r\nprayer-meetings. Mackerel were right knowing fish, he said, and could\r\nwith good feed be coaxed across the line, and into the waters not held\r\nsacred against American hooks by British law. And to this end a goodly\r\namount of bait was ground up; and the wind coming in the quarter most\r\nfavorable to our movements, canvas was got on the Starlight, and in\r\ncharge of Splitwater, who was directed to keep a bright eye on the\r\nwarships, she put to sea like a thing of life dancing with snowy wings\r\nover the blue, blue waters. While he was taking care of the fish,\r\nSmooth remained on shore, keeping those who attended the political\r\nmeeting all right, and making a speech or two when called upon.\r\n\r\n\"To hear the eloquent Joe Howe tell the Nova Scotians what they would\r\nbe were it not for James Johnson and Toryism was really very\r\namusing. He forgot to tell them that he had no serious objection to\r\nbeing made Colonial Secretary seeing that a nice little salary was\r\nattached. When Smooth made his appearance at the political gathering\r\nof course no one thought there was any fish-taking going on. Then he\r\nendeavored to make the credulous citizens feel free and easy,\r\nentertaining them with jokes of a strong kind, and explaining the\r\ncrude process of electioneering down in Texas and Arkansas. No sooner\r\nhad the politicians got through their speeches than they retired to\r\nwhat was called an 'open house,' where all good radicals could drink\r\n_ad libitum_ and make merry. Smooth was honored with an invitation to\r\njoin in a few joyous glasses, but he rather doubted the policy of\r\ndrinking so much election liquor. It might under certain circumstances\r\nserve the ends of politicians, but never the greater interests of a\r\nnation. A drinking man is sure to fool himself in the end, nor can a\r\nman serve the interests of the State who neglects his own. But, be it\r\nhere understood Uncle Sam, there is a philosophical way of applying\r\nthe practical to make things profitable, which may be carried out with\r\nmore facility by making oneself cheerful and courteous with those\r\namong whom we may be cast. This Smooth always aimed to do.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Smooth calculated how he'd got politics enough; an'\r\nknowin' how Splitwater was 'commodatin' the mackerel outside the line,\r\nhe steps down to Deacon Sam Moody's prayer meetin', what they holds at\r\nnight after the 'lection meetin. Here it was all right; Smooth was\r\njust as much of a Christian as anybody could honestly be, and a longer\r\nface nobody could desire. Smooth, at the Deacon's, was-well known for\r\nhis pious principles; but the good folk about there had never seen\r\nSmooth in an anxious way. Well, the deacon congratulated Smooth on his\r\nappearance, his spiritual welfare, his happy prospects of something\r\nbeyond this. It would have done you good to see the brothers and\r\nsisters crowd round him, lookin' so excited 'bout the care of\r\nsomethin' anybody can take care of without neglectin' business. (We\r\nhere give Smooth's language in its crude state). It was amazin' to see\r\nwhat an amount of pious a fellow could get into his face, and then get\r\nhis face into a right focus; but when brother Smalwood invited him to\r\npray! that was shavin' the thing a little too close--more nor a man\r\nwhat was thinking about Splitwater and the mackerel could shoulder.\r\nHad not a mite of an objection to 'commodatin' the good folks with\r\n'most anything, or puttin' on the longest and seriousest face out\r\ndoors--a face that would beat the Deacon's; but couldn't go t'other\r\nthing. Smooth could rather beat the Deacon on a serious face; but the\r\nold hoss was a regular steamboat when it come to exhortations and such\r\nthings. Wouldn't 'a done to have a brush with the Deacon, without\r\nbeing sure of beating him, for he was mighty egotistical about his\r\nprayers. Well, there was no help for it, we must feel kind and happy\r\nto see so many happy ones around one, who could not? It was strictly\r\nin accordance with Smooth's philosophy to make people as happy as\r\npossible, and so he kept asking anxious questions, gettin'\r\nsatisfactory answers,--answers that would be sure to make me all\r\nstraight in the pious, with a day or two's consideration.\r\n\r\n\"In this way the spirits kept up until the pleasant hour of midnight\r\ncame; then the Deacon invited me to go home and hang up at his\r\nhouse. It was just the thing for Smooth, but he had to decline twice\r\nbefore he got over the polite so to accept: and then he knew Split was\r\ntaking the mackerel aboard like sixty. So he went home with the\r\ndeacon, turned in for the night, and knew nothing more till daylight.\r\n\r\n\"Now he must disclose how the Starlight and Split got along, coaxing\r\nthe mackerel with fresh bait, just as General Pierce does the Soft\r\nShells. Split meets the schooner Spunk, Skipper Pluck, afore he begun\r\nto get to the line, outside of which he could fish according to\r\nlaw. Split and he were old cronies, and they just _heaves to_, and has\r\na talk about what's best to be done. 'Twarn't long afore they had\r\nnegotiated the plan, which, when carried out, they were to divide the\r\nspoils equal. Seeing how the Britishers, every year, pay over a\r\nmillion pounds sterling for keeping open the fishing question, driving\r\nthe fish out of the water with big man-o'-war ships and steamships,\r\nand making a deal of pleasant fun for a great many fine gentlemen who\r\nthreaten to swallow a fisherman for taking a fish; and that the United\r\nStates pay about one-fifth as much for the privilege of sending some\r\nof their big ships to help the Britishers play the genteel, while\r\nhoping that stupid diplomacy will long continue to give them the same\r\nOpportunity, Split and Pluck reckoned how they'd come a point over the\r\nBritishers.\r\n\r\n\"The great point was to steer clear of the big British steamer,\r\nDevastation. Pluck said he seed her steamin' away down to the\r\nnorthward t'other a'ternoon, and so it was agreed that Pluck, with the\r\nPinkey Spunk, should run down in her track. If he sighted her in the\r\nmorning he was just to _play her about_ some, until Split got the\r\nmackerel on board. And so, instead of the Devastation going in search\r\nof him, the Spunk went after her, and, as luck would have it, met her\r\njust inside of the treaty line. The Spunk pretended to be shying--put\r\non the rags as if he was going to try legs with the Devastation.\r\nCrowdin' steam like all Jehu, down the Devastation came, as if she\r\nwere going to smash the Spunk, and blow her to Daniel's dungeon. Bang!\r\nwhang! boomed a gun or two, but seem' how ther' warn't no iron fallin'\r\nabout, Pluck reckoned he'd keep her to it a time longer, knowin' in\r\nhis soul that every mile further he got the Devastation away from the\r\nStarlight, so much the better for Splitwater and the mackerel. It\r\nwarn't long, afore whir! ziz! ziz! came somethin' what made a mighty\r\nsplashin', and looked savagarous, square across her stern sheets.\r\nPluck reckoned how the Britisher had got his dander up, and about\r\ncleverest thing would be to round to, seem' how the feller was wastin'\r\nhis shot, and sendin' things what might save a body the trouble of\r\nputtin' on a night-cap about bedtime. 'Now,' said Pluck, 'the\r\nDevastation feels kind a out o' sorts, and 'll just knock the Spunk\r\ninto an apple dumplin';' but she didn't! Well, the skipper and his\r\ndandy officers came on board, looking all so shined up, and vented\r\ntheir indignant feelins' by takin' it all out in a shower of cussin'\r\nthat would 'a made yer hair stand on end straight. In a few minutes\r\nmore, a feller in a monkey jacket, a brass button on his hat, and\r\notherwise officially costumed, put on the dignity of the quarter-deck,\r\nand out-talked the skipper. 'Now, why the devil didn't you come to\r\nwhen you saw our signal?' says he, with a face of daggers, and looking\r\nat Pluck as if he was goin' to spring the main-mast with his teeth.\r\n'Hand up yer papers here--quick, bear a hand! Take off yer hatches,\r\ntoo; you've been fishing inside of the _line_,' he grumbled out, as\r\nquickly as you'd overhaul a chain cable. Pluck bore it like a\r\nphilosopher, cool and quietly. 'No we hain't nether, stranger; hain't\r\nhooked a fish for two days. Can't 'commodate us with a sup of fresh\r\nwater, can ye? Wanted to get a chance at the shore, but ain't had one\r\nfor more nor three weeks; true! by Christopher Columbus,' rejoined\r\nUncle Pluck, puttin' on the most innocent face ye ever did see.\r\n\r\n\"'We'll talk about that by-and-by,' says the Britisher. 'If you'd a\r\ncum to, like a man, as you should, and not given us this long chase\r\nafter you, you might have had some claim to our generosity. We are\r\nonly carrying out Her Majesty's orders for the benefit of the Colonial\r\nfisheries.'\r\n\r\n\"'Lord love yer soul, stranger! had I but known that, ye wouldn't a\r\nseen this salt-water citizen about these diggings. Pluck had been hum,\r\nhelping Cousin Gethro to keep school--would!'\r\n\r\n\"'Never mind that. We don't want yer Yankee soft sauder! Bear a hand,\r\nget your hatches off, and your papers up!'\r\n\r\n\"'Ye hain't seen Uncle Caleb's craft--her name's the Winking\r\nWeazel--as ye come from down north, have ye?' inquires Pluck, giving\r\nthe mate a side wink.\r\n\r\n\"'What the devil do I care about yer Winking Weazels? I'm quite\r\ncertain you have been fishing inside of the line, or you had obeyed\r\nour summons properly,' he growled out again, like a bear in\r\ntrouble. 'Blow my buttons, if I warn't most scared to death when I\r\nseed ye comin'! Couldn't tell what on 'arth ye wanted; and I know'd\r\nthat if there war' a chance at all, it was to run. If I'd know'd ye\r\nwar' such a clever lookin' fellow, and that ye warn't a going to hurt\r\na body, I'd come to quicker nor lightenin.' Pluck got all the\r\nphilosophy in his natur' up. 'Suppose ye step down into the cabin and\r\nhave a leetle of somethin' to take, seem' what a tarnal ugly fog's\r\ncomin' up. Tom Blowers 'll get all the things clear, so ye can take a\r\nlook round, and be satisfied how we ain't been takin' advantage of the\r\nlaw, while you and me wets t'other eye with a little what won't taste\r\nbad,' continues Pluck, doing the polite all up. The good natur' of the\r\nchap was a good way down' in him, but talkin' of a little drop just\r\ndropped into the right place, brought it up all over him. 'Well,\r\nseeing it's you, providing it's right good, I don't mind,' he replied,\r\nreflectively. It warmed up the tender spot in his stomach, and, going\r\ndown below, he wet t'other eye twice. 'Stonishin' to see how good the\r\ncritter got all at once. He was just the best natured Britisher that\r\never came along. 'Twas just the medicine to cure his disease.\r\n\r\n\"'Now! here's the dockerments' (Pluck hands him the papers), 'and ye\r\ncan take a squint into the hold. Hain't touched a fish for three\r\ndays. Just so, stranger,' rejoined Pluck, tellin' the cook to get the\r\nskipper of the Devastation to be kind enough to lend him a keg of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"'Schooner Spunk, of Barnstable, 84 tons burden, Jacob Pluck, master,\r\n&c., &c. Mighty formidable combination,' ejaculated the Britisher,\r\nlookin' his eyes almost out, and runnin' the forefinger of his right\r\nhand over the Spunk's Certificate. Then turning to Pluck, a sort of\r\nhalf-way grin of good nature on his countenance, he continued: 'You\r\nYankees are curious specimens, after all. Pretty generous,\r\ngood-natured when it's profitable, hard to understand, and as cute\r\nas--'\r\n\r\n\"'Don't say the last!' interrupts Pluck. 'Seeing it's you, citizen, we\r\nwont argue that point just now. Satisfied on the dockerments, ain't\r\nye?'\r\n\r\n\"'Confound the dockerments! I don't want to bother myself with\r\nthem. Mind your eye next time; cover when you see the signal,' says\r\nthe Britisher, whom Pluck had got nicely smoothed down.\r\n\r\n\"'Reckon how there won't be any mistake about it next time. Give us\r\nyer hand, captain.' (Pluck shakes hands with the Britisher). 'They say\r\nthe Pinkey, Starlight--you know she's a ripper to fish inside of the\r\nline!--got into a monstrous shoal of fresh mackerel day afore\r\nyesterday, and is now takin' on 'em like sixty, inside of the line,\r\ndown _north-east_ of us.'\r\n\r\n\"'Do you tell me that? That fellow Smooth at it, again, fishing inside\r\nof the line? And inside the point as well, I suppose?' The Britisher\r\nlooked surprised, and listened attentively to Pluck as he assumed an\r\nair of innocence.\r\n\r\n\"'Just so! Smooth is the keenest feller. Don't care a whit about the\r\nline; and the Starlight's so mighty used to fishin' inside, that even\r\nthe fish seem to have a likin' for the skipper.'\r\n\r\n\"'I'll see after that treaty-breaker, I will,' growls the chap,\r\nchanging his good natur' into bad again.\r\n\r\n\"'Down _north-east of us_ ye'll find him, inside the point,' continues\r\nPluck, looking all over serious.\r\n\r\n\"'I'll catch the fellow, and right soon, too;' and, being right good\r\nfriends, they shook hands, and the Britisher left, quite satisfied.\r\nJust as he, in his boat, was leavin' the Spunk for the Devastation,\r\nPluck bellowed out, fearin' he'd forget it, 'Keep a straight course,\r\n_north-east_ about two points east! about two points east! and yer\r\nsure to come upon him.' The last thing Pluck saw of the Devastation,\r\nshe was heading for _the supposed spot_, steering away, drivin' all\r\nthe fish into the middle of the Atlantic, and expecting to find the\r\nStarlight where Pluck said she was.\r\n\r\n\"No sooner was the Devastation put all right than Pluck hauled his\r\nwind, and next mornin' came up with the Starlight, which had taken\r\nabout eighty barrels of fine fat mackerel. The game being nicely\r\nplayed, the Starlight and the Spunk both run in for a shelter, where\r\nthe spoils could be shared according to practical diplomacy--not the\r\ndiplomacy that has been twenty years gettin' the question into an\r\ninterminable difficulty. This done, Smooth, having helped the folks on\r\nshore with their political meetings, and prayer meetings, and\r\nconsultation meetings, stepped on board again, and took command of the\r\nStarlight without any extra trouble. But that was not the end of\r\nit. The looks of such fine fat fish raised a mighty fuss in the town,\r\neverybody forgot the politics and the prayer meetings, and begun to\r\ntalk fish. They declared the Yankees had encroached on the Britisher's\r\nrights. Despatches were next day to go to head-quarters, a whole\r\nBritish fleet was wanted, and must come down and seize Smooth's\r\nPinkey, the Starlight--fish and all. The whole talk and noise didn't\r\nmake much matter to Smooth; he didn't believe in talking--acting was\r\nhis motto--go-ahead. 'Blow away, citizens--blow away! A little more\r\nenergy is worth the whole. There is fish enough for us all; but\r\npolitics and prayer meetings will not catch them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE PIOUS SQUIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The good people of Nova Scotia were, in days gone by, exceedingly\r\ngiven to Toryism, and, as was then held to be the natural result, very\r\nloyal. To such an extent was this loyalty and love of Toryism--as it\r\nwas then called--carried, that a person who consumed 'Yankee goods'\r\nwas seriously suspected of some improper design against the State. The\r\nconsumption of British manufactures and British-grown produce was, on\r\nthe other hand taken as strong testimony of loyalty and confidence in\r\nthe wise powers protecting the interests of the State. The very\r\npresence of 'Yankee goods' was ominous of evil; and as it was\r\ndesirable the good people should be kept well up to their Toryism,\r\nmany were the means resorted to for forcing the exclusive consumption\r\nof British produce. Tea from the United States was prohibited for the\r\nbenefit of the East India Company--powder must be British! Tobacco\r\npaid imperial and colonial duties approximating to a prohibition; and\r\nthe consumer of the weed was considered quite an extravagant\r\naristocrat, who either had dealings with smugglers, or was wasting his\r\nfortune in the ways of the devil. In a word, imperial and colonial\r\nduties dried up the energies of the people, and gave new life to a\r\ncontraband trade that was fast destroying the best interests of the\r\nState. The result was, that the best smuggler was the most desperate\r\nfellow; but it generally happened that the man who said most against\r\n'Yankee goods' was sure to be deepest implicated in contraband trade.\r\n\r\n\"To be a scientific smuggler in those days it was necessary to be a\r\njustice of the peace: and if the office were coupled with that of\r\nchurch warden so much the better. About this time there was, in the\r\nBay of Fundy, an old coaster of the name of Hornblower, who knew every\r\ncreek, cove, inlet and headland, together with all the best points for\r\nsmuggling, from the St. Croix River to Windsor Bay on the one side,\r\nand from Windsor Bay to Barrington on the other. Skipper Hornblower,\r\nas he was then called, had the go-ahead in him, and commanded the\r\nschooner Dash, owned by one Squire Burgle, who carried on a strictly\r\n_legitimate_ trade with the Yankees over the _line_, though he always\r\ngave out that he hated them as a people, nor would ever sell a\r\npennyworth of their notions which he denounced as worthless.\r\nHornblower was a _brusque_ old salt, but had a right good heart in\r\nhim, and, not liking the way trade was restricted by imperial and\r\ncolonial exactions, thought it no harm to work to windward of the\r\ncollectors now and then, and accommodate his friends in a free-trade\r\nsort of way. Tea, 'in them times,' cost six colonial shillings and a\r\nday's journey per pound, and a gallon of molasses about the same. The\r\ngood old women in more remote parts of the province, must have their\r\ntea, and molasses was an indispensable luxury, for they were indeed\r\npoor. But they were compelled to buy of the established merchant, who\r\nwas a sort of prince in his way, and dictated his terms to the people,\r\nwhom he always kept in poverty while he got rich. Molasses, tea,\r\ntobacco, and rum (New England white-eye, labelled Jamaica!)\r\nconstituted his stock in trade. To length of credit he added\r\ncorresponding prices, never forgetting to take good security. His\r\nmedium price for tick was only forty per cent. addition, which he\r\nconsidered extremely liberal.\r\n\r\n\"And thus, through a pettifogging colonial policy, commerce was turned\r\ninto the merest peculation by a class of persons who made it their\r\nobject to restrict the agriculturist, and hold his interests at their\r\nmercy. The more the farmer raised, the more he found himself subject\r\nto the shopkeeper's narrow restrictions; and thus the interests of a\r\nnaturally energetic people were held in check. The Home Government\r\n(God bless it! as the very loyal Provincials used to say when the\r\nImperial Parliament took their cause under consideration) thought\r\nlittle about the outside Nova Scotians, except to say, once in a\r\nwhile, that the territory they inhabited belonged to her Majesty,\r\nwhich fact the people of the province were forcibly reminded of by the\r\npresence of imported gentlemen, whom it had pleased her Majesty to\r\nplace in all responsible offices. In fact, the Home Government,\r\nthrough its pewter-headed policy, was for ever making laws to suit the\r\nimmediate demands of a favored few, who said good things of loyalty\r\nand toryism, and left the rest to chance.\r\n\r\n\"During this state of affairs, Skipper Hornblower's fame sounded far\r\nand wide, and many were the stories told of his smuggling exploits,\r\nand how Squire Burgle always kept a large stock of British goods on\r\nhand, which he never sold cheaper than any body else, though he got\r\nricher. Hornblower's account of how he and the Squire carried on\r\nbusiness together in the good old times may not be uninteresting,\r\n'Squire Burgle,' said Hornblower, 'was a great man in them days, said\r\na sight of good things in his prayers every night and morning,\r\ndenounced smuggling, and hoped all those fearless men that followed it\r\nwould see the error of their way, turn to her Majesty, and make their\r\nloyalty honor the State. Squire used to send me to Boston--(the Dash\r\nwas the only craft in the trade then)--with little things to sell, and\r\na return cargo of flour, gin, tobacco, and such like Yankee notions,\r\nwhich the Nova Scotians must have, and upon which her Majesty lavished\r\nmost ungracious duties, to fetch home. Well, the Squire lived at the\r\ntown of Annapolis, twenty miles up a river, where Digby, at its\r\nentrance, was the only port of entry within a hundred miles. Seeing\r\nthat I liked to make quick trips, it was not always convenient to stop\r\nat this obdurate port of entry, and so I used to lay the Dash's head\r\nfor a piece of dark wood on a point of land outside the entrance\r\n(always being careful to have a clearance in _merchandise_) and run\r\nher close aboard of it. Squire had a cousin living near that bit of\r\nwood, who used to understand the thing, and could sight the Dash's\r\nsignal ten miles at sea. Lying off and on until sundown, the Squire's\r\ncousin would hang out a light on a tree; if at the top it was the\r\nsignal--'All right;' if half-mast, 'Keep out!' 'There's the light--all\r\nright to-night! the boys used to say, when it gleamed at the tree\r\ntop.' Then into the basin and up the river we used to dodge, passing\r\non the opposite side of the river, and as far from the port of entry\r\nas it was possible to get, and reaching a point on the banks where the\r\ncargo was to be discharged, while the folks on shore were all nicely\r\nsleeping. The Squire, of course, had said his prayers, or, as it\r\nsometimes would happen--though it was always accidental--had gone to\r\nDigby, for the purpose of giving her Majesty's Collector a ride into\r\nthe country. The Collector was always an imported gentleman, who\r\nmaintained a good deal of imported dignity, which the Nova Scotians\r\nhad to 'tip' out of him, ere he became a clever fellow, according to\r\ntheir notion of such a being. In addition to taking the Collector a\r\nshort pleasure trip into the country, the Squire had a nigger fellow,\r\nof the name of Tom, who, as cunning as a fox, could tell the Dash was\r\ncoming, by something he always said he saw was in the clouds. Tom\r\nlived on Pin Point, where the Squire had his half-way warehouse,\r\nalways full of foreign goods, on which no one could tell how much duty\r\nhad been paid. This half-way warehouse, which Tom called his, used to\r\natone for a monstrous quantity of sins. The Squire, however, declared\r\nhe had established it there, in the fulness of his generosity, merely\r\nto accommodate his kind customers, whose means of travelling did not\r\nenable them to reach his trading marts at either extreme. But, when\r\ncustomers called at Pin-Point to do a little trading with the Squire,\r\nthey generally found it closed, and Old Tom offering his very best\r\napology, by saying it was where master only did his wholesale\r\nbusiness. This was accepted on the ground that the Squire and Tom were\r\nvery funny individuals. Well, we would run to the Point at night, and\r\nTom having everything ready to move at the word, would shoot the\r\nYankee goods into the warehouse, where, in six hours, they would be\r\nall transferred into real British growth and manufacture. During this\r\ntime the Squire was nowhere; but Tom did things as if he knew\r\nhow. Indeed no sooner were the goods out than we made the best of our\r\nway down the river again.\r\n\r\n\"Next morning, the sun about two hours up, you would see the Dash away\r\ndown the bay, as calm as moonlight, just sighting Digby.\r\nSquire--totally ignorant of Hornblower's arrival--would be putting on\r\nthe longest face in the town of Annapolis, going up and down the\r\nstreet quite disconsolate, and climbing into the church steeple to see\r\nif he could sight the Dash below. 'Hornblower's gone this time!' he\r\nwould say, shaking his head, 'must be lost! must be lost! must be\r\nlost!' And the Squire would tell about his horrid dream, seeing\r\nHornblower's ghost smuggling a chest of tea (real congou), and the\r\nCollector catching him on the spot. 'Hornblower's tricky--he larnt it\r\nof the Yankees--and I'm always afraid he'll get cotched smuggling\r\nlittle things for himself. What a blessing it is to have a clear\r\nconscience!' he would say: the last sentence referring to himself.\r\n\r\n\"But soon the knowing ones got an inkling of the Squire's secrets, and\r\nwhen he mentioned the Dash in his prayers at morning, and walked the\r\nwharf after breakfast, muttering his misgivings, she was sure to\r\narrive in the afternoon. There was virtue in the Squire, but the\r\ncitizens got the hang of it so well, that whenever I arrived at town\r\nthey would say: 'It's only Hornblower's ghost.'\r\n\r\n\"While the Squire would be doing what he called the straight-forward\r\nup in town, I'd be dropping kedge at Digby, where (the Colonial\r\nParliament having withdrawn the appropriation for a boarding-boat,\r\nthat smugglers might get through their little operations without\r\ntrouble) we would send our own boat for the collector. Used to have\r\neverything as bright as a new sixpence, and colors flying, and my own\r\nface squared up to do the honest, when that imported dignitary came on\r\nboard, affecting all the importance of a Port-Admiral.\r\n\r\n\"'Had a good passage, eh, Hornblower?' the prim collector used to ask,\r\nas he mounted the rail.\r\n\r\n\"'Blowed like cannons, outside, last night! Seeing how we had just\r\nballast in her, like to tipped her over,' I'd say, bowing, keeping my\r\nhat in my hand, and doing the polite all up.\r\n\r\n\"'Didn't have a chance to smuggle, according to that, eh?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yer honor knows Hornblower never does that sort of thing. The\r\nSquire, my owner, is pious, you know,' I'd say, keeping the long face\r\nhard down.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, Hornblower, I know your owner to be conscientious and pious;\r\nthat is why I always let you off so easy.' And the collector would\r\nlook so credulously good-natured that I couldn't help drawing out a\r\nroll of cigars, telling him they were pure Havanas, when presenting\r\nthem. It used to do me good to see how it--small as it was--softened\r\nthings about his heart. I would immediately follow the cigars with the\r\npapers, taking good care to have merchandise enough in the hold to\r\ncorrespond with what was set forth on the clearance and manifest. 'Ye\r\nsee, sir,' I'd remark, 'I never smuggles, except it is a few cigars\r\nnow and then, for my own smoking! Old Jacob Grimes says, when a\r\ngovernment makes laws what people can't live to, you must live round\r\nthem; but them ain't my principles.'\r\n\r\n\"'Thank you, Mr. Hornblower, I am sure you have more regard for your\r\nhonor than to smuggle,' he would resume, keeping his eyes fixed upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"'I am obliged to you for the confidence--the confidence of superiors\r\nin spirit or body; and I hope I may never do anything but what will\r\nmerit yours. It has been my motto through life to keep before me the\r\nwords of my good old mother. Ah! she was a mother. Fond soul, she used\r\nto say, 'Solomon, my boy, let your dealing with the world be marked by\r\nhonesty, and remember that one small error in your life may stain\r\nforever your character. The eyes of an unforgiving world once excited\r\nto suspicion will ever wear the same glasses.'' Having said this,\r\nnothing more was wanted to make complete the Squire's confidence.\r\nWithout further detention, he would have the papers made out, and\r\nhaving received them, we would trim our sheets and sail away up the\r\nriver, Old Tom boarding us off Pin Point, and laughing himself almost\r\nout of his black skin--welcoming us after the fashion of friends met\r\nafter a long absence. All this time the Squire would be impatiently\r\nwaiting on the wharf at the little town of Annapolis--so glad to see\r\nHornblower! 'No contraband goods on board, eh, Hornblower?' he would\r\ninquire, affecting such an amount of piety that it made me laugh in my\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\n\"'Not so much as a plug of tobacco!' I would reply, contemplatively,\r\nas the crew commenced putting out the few things we had entered at Her\r\nMajesty's Custom House. We had great regard for Her Majesty; nor have\r\nI the least doubt of the Squire's honesty, which would have been all\r\nright had it not been for the law and parliament. We have only to add\r\nthat, having played his part after the manner of a good Christian, he\r\nwould seek his way home, there to arrange an evening prayer-meeting.\r\n\r\n\"But the beauty of the Squire's nature, as illustrated in his pious\r\nhatred of smuggling, or otherwise defrauding Her Majesty, would shine\r\nout bright on the day the Dash left on her return voyage. I was sure\r\nof an invitation to breakfast with him on that morning, and he was\r\nequally sure to paint the purity of his conscience in such glowing\r\ncolors that it was difficult for me to maintain a serious face. When\r\nwe had eaten bread, and he had offered up his prayer (in which he\r\nalways remembered Her Majesty), he would accompany me to the Dash,\r\nwhen, having got on board, and cast off, he would mount the most\r\nprominent place on the cap-sill, where the citizens assembled could\r\nhear him, and cry out at the top of his voice:--'Hornblower!\r\ngood-bye. One word more, Hornblower! Let me entreat you not to smuggle\r\na pennyworth for anybody.' My reply always was that I would follow his\r\nadvice with christian strictness. Then he would modestly finger that\r\ncravat so white, and fix in his face such becoming dignity, that I\r\nthought his green glasses, which I never liked, covered his eyes to\r\ngreat advantage. 'Remember what I have always endeavored to impress on\r\nyour mind,' he would continue; 'honesty is the best policy--it is!'\r\nJust then everybody would look at the Squire, while it was with great\r\neffort I kept from my face a smile. I knew honesty was the best\r\npolicy; I knew it was the true policy to all praiseworthy ends; but\r\nhow could I help contemplating the necessity of those preaching who\r\nnever practised it, seeing that the Squire was not what he seemed, for\r\nhe smuggled an hundred barrels of flour for every one he paid duty\r\nupon. I had also seen him pass sentence of imprisonment and fine on\r\nthe wretch who smuggled a demijohn of bad spirits, when for him I had\r\nsmuggled a thousand.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to a more liberal commercial policy, that has precluded the\r\nnecessity for such scenes as the Dash stealing her way into a river at\r\nnight to land her cargo of contraband goods. Those violations of law,\r\nso prevalent a few years ago, have ceased; and in the improved\r\ncondition of the people we see the result of a new and more liberal\r\npolicy. But a few years ago, that small craft, the Dash, alone sought\r\nto establish what was considered a doubtful trade with the port of\r\nBoston; now, some forty pursue a profitable traffic with the State of\r\nMassachusetts, which has annually brought to her in British bottoms no\r\nless than 170,000 cords of Nova Scotia grown fire-wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nSMOOTH ENCOUNTERS A COLONIAL JUSTICE OF STRANGE CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nova Scotia being what a South Carolinian would call a hard country\r\nto live in (though the people were proverbially kind, and hospitable,\r\nand loyal, and simple-minded), Smooth, like many other special\r\nministers, resolved to give up his mission in disgust, and, without\r\nfurther delay, seek the arms of General Pierce. However, before\r\nquitting the province, he visited the shores of Cape Breton (an island\r\nbelonging to Her Most Gracious Majesty), and there met with a\r\nsingularly eccentric character of the name of Belhash. This Belhash\r\nadded to a figure of great rotundity a square, red face, small hazel\r\neyes, a heavy, flat nose, a low, reclining forehead, and a head\r\ncovered with red, crispy hair, which he took great pains to part in\r\nthe centre. The only expression the Squire's face could lay claim to\r\nwas that of a pumpkin burned ripe in the sun. When in his favorite\r\ndress of blue-grey homespun, which he judiciously arranged (for\r\nBelhash was a Squire), no greater functionary lived on the island;\r\nthat is, in his well-developed opinion of himself! His principal law\r\nbusiness consisted in settling all disputes arising between the people\r\non shore and the Yankee fishermen who, against the law, infested the\r\ncoast, and for whom the Squire had a hatred he always made known in\r\nhis decisions. To Belhash the Americans were all of a flock, they\r\nwould steal, smuggle, take a Nova Scotiaman's eyeteeth out, and, what\r\nhe most hated, concoct some republican plot to overthrow his darling\r\ngovernment. 'Now,' said the Squire to me, one day, 'I have no bad\r\nopinion of you individually, Smooth; for, by the righteous, you're a\r\nsort of clever feller--an exception to Yankees in general--nor do I\r\nthink you'll steal!'\r\n\r\n\"I said, 'No, I didn't think I would!' And he continued: 'You must\r\nsee I am something of a man here on these shores; in fact, sir, some\r\ncall me very distinguished; but I hardly think I have arrived at that\r\nyet, though the honorable attorney-general of the province, when this\r\nway lectioneerin about a year ago, in referring to my position in\r\nadministering the law, said: 'That distinguished gentleman, Squire\r\nBelhash, than whom none is loyaler, or more capable of administering\r\nthe law;' he did, sir, I assure you!'\r\n\r\n\"Of course I bowed to this, and declared the compliment as merited as\r\nhandsomely bestowed. And then he continued: 'You see now, sir--and\r\nit's no small compliment to a man in this out of the way part of the\r\nworld!--I holds her Majesty's commission to alienate (some call it\r\ndemonstrate) the laws of the land.' Here the Squire's face broadened\r\nand got redder, and the flashy handkerchief seemed too small for the\r\norganic conformation of his big blue-veined neck.\r\n\r\n\"'Now and then, though, I gets a law case so confoundedly\r\ncross-grained, that I'se forced to call in Lawyer Songster (he's a\r\ncute un, ye know), afore I can get the point o'nt halucinated. Then,\r\nSmooth, you see, I isn't one a them kind a folk what run after\r\nbigified gentry; and that's how I'se got where I has! A squire in this\r\npart of the world is somebody, I assure ye, sir. Then, what's more,\r\nI've always bin as loyal as a body could be; but, remember ye, I\r\nwarn't on the Tory side, and for the very reason that they never\r\nappreciated native talent and native larnin. Them were the days,' said\r\nthe Squire, accompanying the words with a sort of political flourish,\r\nwhat tried the souls of us county-folk. Tory Johnson, and Radical Joe\r\nHowe, used to come this way lectioneerin, and set the whole country by\r\nthe ears; what folk neither of 'em winned over to his party they were\r\nsure to get drunk; and poor folks were so fascinated with politics\r\nthere was no getting a stroke of work done for a month after. Joe\r\nHowe, see ye I was a perfect Jones on politics--was what them that\r\nknow most about politics called a champion of free suffrage; and, what\r\nwas more nor all, worked himself up from the use of a printer's stick\r\nto holding a stick of stronger cast over the whole province, not even\r\nexcepting our own country. In fact, he kicked Sir Rupert George out of\r\nthe Colonial Office only for himself to be kicked in. Well, Joe said\r\nif I'd put in the strong talk, and lectioneer for him and the\r\nradicals, he'd make me Squire when he got in the _place_--and he kept\r\nhis word, you see. Joe once see'd me try a case, and he was so taken\r\nwith it, there was no describin' his feelins. I take it you'd think\r\nnatur had done her part for me in knowin' so much 'bout law, if ye'd\r\nsee me put a case through.'\r\n\r\n\"The Squire had it all his own way, Smooth not having a chance to put\r\nin a word edgewise. 'But, seem' how you cussed Yankees has upset\r\neverything in trade along the coast, I isn't so rich as I used to be.\r\nThere wor a time when my little store was as good a gold mine as you\r\ncould turn up in Californey; I could get any kind of a price for\r\ngoods; and New England rum, what I liquidated with a sprinklin of\r\nJamaica, sold as quick as gold-dust at fifteen shillins a gallon.'\r\n\r\n\"Here, by the way of diversifying the conversation, I inquired if he\r\nremembered the Queen, in the way of _duties paid!_\r\n\r\n\"The Squire opened his spacious mouth, showed his great shark-like\r\nteeth, threw away his worn quid, gave his eyes a significant roll\r\nsideways, laughed out heartily, and with his left fist added a warning\r\npinch under my left ribs. 'Don't ask that unanswerable question! The\r\ncustom-house was so far off that nobody thought it any harm to\r\nsmuggle, just a little! Bless ye! Mr. Smooth, why (here Belhash wiped\r\nhis face with a flashy Spitalfields) the Rector used to get all his\r\ntea smuggled; nor a bit of harm did he think it. But, times ain't as\r\nthey wos then, nor did folks deal so much in politics and Yankee\r\nnotions.' Here the Squire gave his head a significant twist, as his\r\nface glowed as expressive as a fatherly pumpkin of venerable\r\nage. After another dissertation on the mode of administering the laws\r\nof the land, he invited me into his law establishment, which was the\r\nkitchen of a somewhat dilapidated farm-house, of very small\r\ndimensions, clapboarded and shingled after the old style. I (Smooth)\r\nsaid there could be no objections to this proceeding, and so,\r\nfollowing him very cheerfully into the kitchen, he fussed about for\r\nsome time among what seemed the cookery arrangements, and at length\r\ndrew from a chest that stood firmly fixed under an old deal table near\r\na spacious fire-place, in which was a monster back-log, from behind\r\nwhich the ferret eyes of three mischievous urchins peered curious and\r\ncomical, his judicial suit. Again from the chest the Squire drew forth\r\na large steel chain, and a very mysterious-looking book, and began\r\ndecorating himself in the most shocking manner. This done, he repaired\r\nto the door, in all his profuseness, and seated himself on a block of\r\nwood just outside, where as if suddenly becoming conscious of the\r\nabsence of something very necessary to his personal appearance, he\r\ndoffed his coat, rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and what, readers, do\r\nyou suppose he commenced doing?--Getting up the dignity! With nothing\r\nless than a pound of chalk before him, he commenced polishing up a\r\nsteel chain that might on an emergency have served to chain up a very\r\nlarge bull-dog; but the Squire adapted it to the more fashionable use\r\nof adorning himself, and making safe his ponderous pinchbeck\r\nwatch. Belhash now puffed, and blowed, and swore, and sweated, and\r\npiled on the chalk, and rubbed and tugged criss-crass his knee, until,\r\nwith the motion and fritting, he had well nigh covered his cloth with\r\nthe white substance, from the knee downward. Getting it to the dignity\r\npoint of brightness he invited me back into his forum, which served\r\nthe double purpose of kitchen and law-shop. Here he again smothered\r\nhimself in an extra coat of judicial homespun, and solicited my\r\nassistance in securing the bandanna tight about his neck. 'I looks\r\nsomethin' of a judge, I take it, now?' he said, waiting my approval of\r\nhis personal appearance, as he fingered the broad turn of his\r\nshirt-collar, which seriously threatened his ears and chin. I said I\r\nnever saw a judicial gentleman look more upish. In fact, nobody could\r\ndeny that in clothes the Squire was all consequence; and when he\r\nloomed into 'Court,' all over the steel chain, believe it, there were\r\nbows and servilities without stint. Taking his seat on a high birch\r\nblock, the plank table being set before him, on which to spread his\r\ninseparable law-book, the plaintiffs and defendants assembled, and\r\ntook seats on a wooded bench in front. 'All persons whatsoever havin'\r\nany business whatever with this 'ere court--Squire Belhash\r\nsitting--must come for'ard now or never,' cries out at the top of a\r\ndeep sonorous voice a little scraggy-looking Scotchman, who, without\r\ncoat or vest (his shirt-sleeves rolled up, and the right leg of his\r\nnether garment tucked away beneath a coarse deck-boot), acted the\r\ndouble part of usher and constable. Again directing a few legal\r\nphrases to the Squire, who bowed acknowledgingly, he turned to those\r\npresent--hoped gentlemen would take their hats off, and spit in the\r\nfire-place, seeing how the Court had been newly sanded.\r\n\r\n\"Having examined a paper, somewhat judicially, the Squire, with an air\r\nof dignified endurance, turning to his usher, said:--'Well, I reckon,\r\nit's best to try the case of Hornblower versus the herrins!' Down he\r\nlaid Justice's Guide. It seemed that on the previous night sundry\r\nfishing nets had by some mysterious process been relieved of their\r\nburden. This, one of the Squire's sons charged to the ingenuity, and,\r\nas he set forth without fear or trembling, stealing propensities of\r\none skipper Hornblower, who at this time sailed a saucy-looking craft\r\ncalled the 'Virtue of Cape Cod.' This Hornblower was one of the\r\nindependent school, cared not seven coppers for anybody, nor had the\r\nmost virtuous respect for the nets of his neighbours; he looked the\r\npink-perfection of a Cape Cod fisherman. The skipper rose before his\r\naccusers; his hard, weather-bleached face looking as if his intention\r\nto throw a harpoon into somebody was the very best in the world. Then\r\nhis dark eyes flashed lightning at the Squire, who commanded the\r\nlittle Scotchman to read the indictment. This suspicious looking\r\ndocument set forth that one skipper Hornblower, of the schooner\r\nVirtue, had feloniously, and with malice aforethought, extracted from\r\nthe nets of one James Belhash, son by lawful wedlock of the presiding\r\njustice, sundry herring, mackerel, and other fish--such as usually\r\ncome into such nets, and are found on these Her Majesty's shores. Here\r\nthe Squire interrupted by commencing an essay on the enormity of the\r\ncrime; and concluded with the following pungent remark:--'Now,\r\nHornblower, I knows, without ginning a look in the law-book, you're\r\nguilty; there's always stealin done when you're about the shore.\r\nAnyhow! what say ye for yourself? Remember, you're in a Magistrate's\r\nCourt--in the presence of a justice of the peace!'\r\n\r\n\"'So far as that is concerned, I'll knock under, Squire; but I just\r\nwants to see yer prove a thing or two afore ye come possum over this\r\nsalt-water citizen!' returns Hornblower, spunkily, pulling from the\r\npocket of his pea-coat a fascinating wedge of tobacco, which so\r\ntempted the Squire that he could not resist reaching out his hand and\r\nsupplying his spacious mouth. As nature, ever erring, should be\r\ngenerous to nature, so also did I interrupt here by offering to plead\r\nHornblower's case; to which meritorious object I commenced taking off\r\nmy coat.\r\n\r\n\"'Don't want nobody to soft-soap the case--especially a Yankee--for\r\nthere's the law in that ar' book (here the high functionary turned\r\ndown the corner of the very page on which it stood forcible to his\r\nmind), and I knows all about it--d----d if I don't!'\r\n\r\n\"'Swearin' ain't judiciary, Squire!' says I.\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't none a' your business,' he rejoined, letting his anger get\r\nabove his caution. 'Call Jacob--he'll swar t' what he see'd the\r\nskipper do!' Here Jacob, a younger son of the Squire, was called.\r\nJacob had seen some seventeen summers; and in addition to what larnin'\r\nthe Squire had 'gin him,' was well up in the swearing business, for\r\nthe furtherance of which his abilities were frequently invoked.\r\n\r\n\"'There is not a man long shore what don't know and respect Jacob,'\r\ncontinued the Squire, shutting up his law book, angrily. 'Jacob's a\r\nson a' mine--Jacob 's got larnin, too--Jacob 's bin more nor two years\r\nto Master Jacques's school at the corner; and he has taken Master\r\nJacques's place many a time when that larned gentleman had taken a\r\ndrop too much. Now, Jacob, tell all you know; and let it be just as\r\nstraight!'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Dad,' ejaculated Jacob, who, one might seriously have\r\ninferred, had been raised on a guano bag, and slipped very\r\nunexpectedly into a suit of linsey-woolsey grey mixed; 'I see'd the\r\nVirtue at anchor right broad off the nets, which the skipper kept a\r\nfacksinatin eye on, as he paced up and down the quarter-deck.'\r\n\r\n\"'The devil you did!' Hornblower cried out, at the top of his deep,\r\ncoarse voice, letting fly a stream of juice that e'en most skinned the\r\nSquire's nasal organ.\r\n\r\n\"'Dan'l!--d----mn it! bring a bucket here for the skipper!'\r\ninterrupted the Squire. He hoped Jacob would continue with the\r\nremainder of his evidence. 'And the skipper looked so all-fired strong\r\nat the nets that I couldn't help tellin Uncle Enoch how they'd be\r\nstripped afore morning. Sure enough, just as I said, there warn't a\r\nherrin left in the mornin. Seeing how the game war' going, I went\r\naboard to take breakfast with the skipper; and there, if his table\r\nwarn't spread with the fattest fried fresh herrin--'\r\n\r\n\"'That's all ye knows, ain't it, Jacob? That's more en enough; my own\r\nmind was made up afore I read the law, and heard the testimony,'\r\nrejoined the Squire, looking suddenly wise. 'Yes, dad!' emphatically\r\nreturned Jacob, 'but I know'd they were the very same herrin, by the\r\ntaste on 'em: they tasted as if they wor stolen!' And Jacob having\r\ndelivered himself of this tart and somewhat strange rejoinder, gave\r\nhis shoulder a significant shrug, as he watched dad's eyes, without\r\nfaltering.\r\n\r\n\"'That's plump testimony--there's no coming yer Yankee twist over\r\nthat! Ye see, Hornblower, I knows the hang of the law, slap up. The\r\npublic should know these outrages; the Parliament should be apprised\r\nof such breaches of law and moral honesty; the Home Government should\r\nknow what cussed pests the Yankees are! We don't want you here at all,\r\nHornblower; you've turned pedler, and upset all our trade--there now!'\r\nHere the Squire worked himself up into a perfect fever of excitement,\r\npressing his law-book firmly on the table while addressing his legal\r\nobservations to his auditory. 'I shall pronounce you guilty,\r\nHornblower, and judge you to pay a fine of twenty pounds currency,\r\naccording to the sovereign law of this Her Most Gracious Britannic\r\nMajesty's province.'\r\n\r\n\"I interrupted by telling him to go-ahead. 'Squire, if you warn't so\r\nfast, I'd try to get a word in edgewise for Hornblower,' said I. But,\r\nbefore the Squire had time to retort, Hornblower himself took up the\r\nweapon. 'Great Jehu----e! Squire,' he ejaculated, 'you know no more\r\nabout the law than Dobbin Dobson's donkey--ye hain't worth two cents!'\r\nHornblower's face blazed with red rage, and the Squire got himself all\r\non his pins.\r\n\r\n\"'Keep your clapper shut, Hornblower,' returned the Squire, telling\r\nHornblower, how, if he doubted his capacity for the law business, he\r\nwould read him Haliburton's opinions, and convince him that they\r\nprecisely conformed with his. 'Remember you're in the presence of a\r\nJustice of the Peace!' he added, as Hornblower replied by informing\r\nhim that so long as he was before him nothing more was necessary to\r\nremind him of the fact. Then he begged the Squire to keep cool, and\r\nnot get into a fuzzle: and after he had bestowed some sharp retorts,\r\nin not very fashionable language, which he hoped the Squire would not\r\ntake as personal, he made an explanation of the whole thing. 'Go on,'\r\nrejoined the Squire, getting warmer and warmer.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' returned Hornblower; 'first I motion to adjourn the Court and\r\ngo drink all round, at your store; after which I further motion that\r\nJacob and me go down into the cellar of your house--'\r\n\r\n\"'Into my cellar!' interrupted the Squire, suddenly: 'not a\r\nstep!--I'se settled the case, and there's no moving judgment.'\r\n\r\n\"Here Hornblower charged the Squire with having a suspicious quantity\r\nof fresh herring in his own cellar. 'I don't say how they got there\r\nthis morning afore daylight, Squire,' said he, 'but there's a citizen\r\nnot far off what will.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's the ram--d----d'st false ever told against a gentleman of my\r\nhigh standing!'\r\n\r\n\"'What is Squire?' interpolated Hornblower, keeping as cool as the\r\nface of a March morning. Why!' returns the Squire, 'to say I stole 'em\r\nmyself!'\r\n\r\n\"'There can be no mistaking it Squire,' chimes in Hornblower; 'and the\r\nstronger evidence is the fact of your being the only son of a man who\r\nhas yet preferred the charge of stealing them. Now, Squire, I'll\r\nstake the schooner Virtue, that on proceeding into your cellar the\r\nherring will be recovered and injured justice satisfied: just grant us\r\na warrant to search your cellar, Squire.' Here Hornblower looked\r\nthunder and lightning at the Squire whose wrath and misgiving seemed\r\ncarrying out a sad conflict in his heart. The result was a strange\r\nclatter of tongues. Notwithstanding the Squire's estimate of his own\r\npopularity, the good people on the coast well understood his singular\r\nprocess of doing up the law business. 'You'll get your straight ups to\r\njail, or pay the coin right down, Hornblower!' demanded the Squire,\r\nmaking a flourish with his law-book, and preparing to adjourn for the\r\npurpose of doing a small quantity of drinking.\r\n\r\n\"'The Squire's a humbug!--he is!--I'll blow the Court to thunder.\r\nJust clar the kitchen,' cried out the skipper, stripping off his coat,\r\nas if to have a tug and hug with the Squire, who at that moment wanted\r\nto get a word in edgewise. The next Smooth saw, the Squire was letting\r\nfly at Hornblower's head the law-book; which rather summary\r\ndemonstration was replied to by a stream of tobacco juice, with which\r\nHornblower blinded the Squire, setting him nearly frantic. By the way,\r\nthe law-book missed its intended object, and stormed the end of Uncle\r\nSeth Sprague's nose, nearly knocking off an inch or two.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, if that is Colonial law, Squire, I think how a little home-made\r\nYankee justice won't be a bad application,' said Hornblower, making\r\nready to administer the medicine; then he squared off, and sent his\r\nmauler right into the Squire's dumplin depot, so sharp and strong, as\r\nto produce a decided conviction. At length the Squire was floored, and\r\nfound working the rule of three on the boards. Here the diplomacy\r\nbecame so warm, that Smooth having the very highest regard for Mr.\r\nPierce and his fighting diplomatists who deemed getting up duels, and\r\nwriting down editors very necessary preliminaries to their mission,\r\nthought he would withdraw, leaving the intricacy to Hornblower's\r\nsettlement, seeing that he was producing the strongest kind of notes\r\nand protocols.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSMOOTH SETTLES ALL INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Smooth, on returning to the arms of Mr. Pierce, concluded it would\r\nnot be bad policy to touch at Halifax, meet Uncle John Bull's\r\nCommissioner, and with him make a final settlement of all\r\ninternational questions. And now, being alongside of George's Island,\r\nwhich rises abruptly in the centre of Halifax harbor, and nearly\r\nopposite the old tower on Point Pleasant--and from which a splendid\r\nview of the surrounding country may be obtained, I feel a desire to\r\nrelate some scenes of singular import which have been enacted in this\r\nplace. My respect for the feelings of great men and governors,\r\nhowever, causes me to withhold some few of them. Indeed, my character\r\nfor modesty being pretty well established, I am more than cautions how\r\nI bring it in contact with the nervous system of such gentry.\r\nNevertheless, seeing that not uncommonly the greatest and most\r\npowerful nations turn the smallest beings into very great men, and\r\nspend no end of money to do nobody any good, a short, and I may say, a\r\nvery modest account from the catalogue of my experience, may not be\r\nout of place. Well, I, Smooth, _Minister-in-General to General\r\nPierce_, received, in addition to my own previous conclusion, an\r\nincentive to the object in view, conveyed in a dispatch from my\r\nGrandpapa Marcy, in which he advised the repairing immediately to\r\nHalifax, there to witness the grand battle that was to for ever settle\r\nthe fish question, and give peace to fishermen and fish in general. It\r\nwas sincerely hoped that in the settlement of this long unsettled\r\nquestion, Mr. Pierce would keep his black-pig at home. The result\r\nproved the mistake: war was declared. And the day on which the great\r\nstruggle would be decided ushered in upon a scene at once gloomy and\r\nominous. Mysterious and fleecing clouds now obscured the heavens, and\r\nagain shadowed with their silvery mists the surface of the sullen\r\nstream. A contest of mighty import was to be decided. The hazard was\r\ngreat, but the point to be gained small indeed; and men moved along\r\nthe busy streets whispering their strong misgivings. Monster\r\nwar-ships, with ponderous engines supplied, rode like sleeping demons\r\nupon the water's leaden surface. An hour of anxiety passed, a signal\r\nof war echoed forth, and murmured over the landscape like distant\r\nthunder coursing along the heavens. Then the murmuring sound\r\nre-echoed, as if the battlements above had opened upon the earth and\r\nsea. Soon Britannia's wooden walls were seen veering into line and\r\npreparing for action; America's ranged in the same order, waiting the\r\ndread moment. Anxious eyes and thoughts strained in expectation of the\r\nbloody struggle; then the boatswain's shrill whistle sounded forth,\r\nthe leaden clouds overhead chased away, and bolder outlined became the\r\nfigures of venerable Admirals, who, immersed in glittering uniforms,\r\npaced their quarter-decks. Again the ominous mouths of fierce cannon\r\nsuddenly protruded more savagely from the sides of the huge hulks, and\r\nthe shrill whistle sounded; all was bustle and confusion--eager\r\nthousands of both sexes crowded wharves lining the shore, and many\r\nstruggled for space to stand upon while witnessing the terrible\r\nconflict. Again all was hushed into stillness; in breathless suspense\r\ndid excitement sit on every countenance, as if waiting for the signal\r\nflash soon to break forth and turn everything into a chaos. A\r\nquarter-master was seen passing a speaking trumpet to the burly old\r\nBritish admiral, who, judging from his deportment, might have supplied\r\nthe place of a rare curiosity in any cabinet of ancient relics. With\r\nit in his hand the ancient veteran mounted a gun on the starboard\r\nquarter, and shouted forth the ominous sound: 'I accept your\r\nchallenge--all ready?' A terrible movement was now perceptible among\r\nthe spectators on shore.\r\n\r\n\"'You ill-treated myself and officers while on shore a few days ago;\r\nand you shall pay the penalty of your insult. I'll lick you; I'll be\r\ndamned if I don't,' answered the American, saucily.\r\n\r\n\"'You're spunk; but we'll take a little of it out, by the way of\r\nreducing your pretensions--that's all. Now, my good cousin, just look\r\nout for the shivering of your timbers. I'm going to load with grape, a\r\njolly mixture I shall slap right into you.'\r\n\r\n\"'That's e'en jist the medicine!' rejoined the Yankee: that's jist\r\nwhat I'm going to load with; and if it won't kill, we'll take cogniac\r\ncanister! But old fellow, we'll larn ye how the Britishers can't take\r\nthe spunk out of us Yankees: s'pose ye come on board my craft, lay off\r\nyer old notions, and play the good fellow in the jolly free-and-easy\r\nway. We'll then consider the horrors of war; and see if the matter\r\ncan't be discussed in a different way atween decks.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, seeing it's you--not a bad sort of a chap, by the way, I don't\r\nmuch care if I do; but don't let go any grape until I gets under yer\r\nlee--perhaps we'd better fight it out on your gun-deck. Captain, my\r\ndear fellow (here the captain looked as good-natured as a turtle\r\nstudying law) any way to suit your own canister!' returned the\r\nrear-admiral of Uncle John's best blue.\r\n\r\n\"'I say, while you are about it, Admiral,' rejoined the Yankee, with a\r\nsort of half flirtish, half earnest air--while you are about to come\r\nbroad on, just bring all the good folks with you--and don't forget the\r\nladies; bring them, too. There's nothing like plenty of fair faces\r\nwhen a strong battle is to be fought!' This was a right good say on\r\nthe part of Commodore Shubrick (such was the Yankee skipper's name),\r\nwho smiled all over his wrinkled face. It was quite enough. The\r\ngallant Britisher's face, too, brightened up with good-nature, the\r\nboatswain sounded his whistle, the savage guns disappeared in their\r\nports; the yards were manned with jolly tars, and away streaked the\r\nadmiral in his barge, skimming the sullen water, towards the Yankee,\r\nunder a heavy cannonade of grape. The ladies, loving and affectionate\r\nsouls! couldn't stand it another minute, and, with a Joan of Arc\r\nheroism, volunteered to follow the gallant admiral, for the purpose of\r\nseeing that their sweethearts and husbands were not seriously wounded\r\nby the Commander's grape and other missiles most dangerous. Again loud\r\nreports were heard--pop! pop! pop!--ziz! ziz! ziz! went the shots of\r\nordinary mixture: then whole broadsides began to be poured into the\r\nbelligerents in grand style. After a few hours' cannonading, all was\r\nagain bustle and confusion; wounded men were seen tumbling over the\r\nsides of the ship, fair ladies became unfairly terrified, and then,\r\ndisgusted with the cowardice of their husbands and sweethearts, might\r\nbe seen nearly fainting in the arms of gallant officers. After the\r\nwhole affair was over, a great many wounded husbands, whose cases were\r\nextremely doubtful, were conveyed to their homes; others dreaded the\r\napplication of Caudle lecture medicine from wives who had long\r\npreceded them to their domestic hearths. A facetious contemporary has\r\ndescribed this great affair in the following graphic manner:\r\n\r\n\"On attempting to mount the stairs hung at the side, Commodore\r\nShubrick, standing on the quarter-deck, let drive a fish-ball, which\r\nhe held in his hand, and struck the Admiral a little below the left\r\neye. The Admiral, nothing daunted, ran up the steps, his officers\r\nfollowing close behind, and seized the Commodore by the hand, and gave\r\nhim such a shaking as made him tremble again. General Gore, on\r\nreaching the 'poop,' was grossly insulted by the first lieutenant of\r\nthe Princeton, who, in the most cool and deliberate manner, told him,\r\nif he would come below, he would give him 'something to eat.'\r\n\r\n\"The General, in reply, said he would like to catch him at it. And to\r\nshow his courage he went below, when one of the middies at the foot of\r\nthe companion-way took aim at the General with a champagne bottle, and\r\nlet drive the contents into the General's glass. The Mayor of Halifax,\r\nand members of the Corporation, got into a skirmish with the\r\nmarines. It seems that Alderman Nugent asked the boatswain, in a\r\nsneering sort of way, if they had any turtle on board. The answer was,\r\n'No--but we've got turtle soup, if that will do for you.' The Mayor\r\nstepped up, and said he would rather have turtle soup than _fish_ any\r\nday. The boatswain answered that he was tired of hearing so much said\r\nabout fish. For his own part, he didn't see anything in fish to fight\r\nabout. If it was mutton, he was on hand for anybody. One word led on\r\nto another--by this time the steamer was crowded from stem to\r\nstern--until at length there was a general row; every man became a\r\nbody corporate, and pitched into himself with right good will.\r\n\r\n\"The ladies got snappish on account of their husbands, and in turn\r\npitched into the officers of the Princeton with their--eyes. The\r\nsailors were piped to quarters. Pistols were freely used. The 'big\r\nguns' were charged and fired, doing much damage to the feelings of the\r\ncompany, in the way of compliments. In short, it was the greatest\r\nbattle ever fought in Halifax harbor, real or _sham_. After\r\nquarrelling in this way, until eight o'clock in the evening, and\r\ndestroying all the eatables that could be found on board the\r\nPrinceton, the invaders retired, and left the Commodore and officers\r\nto their reflections. The retreat was effected in _gallant_ style--so\r\nsay the ladies. It is said that the Commodore has sent a despatch to\r\nWashington, informing the authorities of the insult received. We\r\nearnestly entreat that our American contemporaries will fully discuss\r\nthis serious matter, on account of the honor of the 'stars and\r\nstripes,' to say nothing of the 'fish story.'\r\n\r\n\"'Now, Mr. Pierce, in this manner was a very grave question--the fish\r\nquestion, in which many millions had been spent for the purpose of\r\npleasing diplomacy--put through a course of settlement. When will the\r\nwisdom of the two most free and enlightened nations of the earth\r\ndevise some plan of mutual compromise, by which the interests of their\r\nsubjects may be settled without giving to pedantic diplomatists the\r\nmeans to for ever keep alive an international agitation, which can\r\nonly give out food for the very smallest of demagogues? We cannot and\r\nmust not quarrel with Uncle John; no, our birthright, our\r\nfreedom-loving spirit, our indomitable energy, our kindred\r\ninstitutions, and the interests of our commerce, should make stronger\r\nthe bonds of peace. We must, in defiance of that pitiable ambition of\r\npolitical tools, who so interrupt the harmony that should exist\r\nbetween nations kindred in spirit and interests, continue our friendly\r\nrelations. Let England lay aside her restrictions on commerce; let her\r\napply to a better purpose those millions spent in useless attempts to\r\nenforce the observance of laws which only serve to cripple her\r\nenergies; and let a policy mutually liberal serve to elevate that\r\ninternational forbearance which is the father of the greatest good,'\r\nthought I. At this juncture, Mr. Pierce's black pig, always found\r\nwhere he was not wanted, was discovered in the after cabin, which he\r\ndisputed with every one who attempted to enter, until at length it was\r\nvoted that I should capture him, and convey him safely home to\r\nMr. Pierce at Washington:--which, be it understood, was done, though\r\nnot without a struggle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
