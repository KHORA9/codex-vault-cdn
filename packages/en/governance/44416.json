Many of them were dictated at the moment, by the\r\nimpulse of impressions made by important political events, and abound\r\nwith a correspondent warmth of expression. This freedom of language wil\r\nbe excused by the frends of the revolution and of good guvernment, who\r\nwil recollect the sensations they hav experienced, amidst the anarky and\r\ndistraction which succeeded the cloze of the war. On such occasions a\r\nriter wil naturally giv himself up to hiz feelings, and hiz manner of\r\n_riting_ wil flow from hiz manner of _thinking_.\r\n\r\nMost of thoze peeces, which hav appeered before in periodical papers and\r\nMagazeens, were published with fictitious signatures; for I very erly\r\ndiscuvered, that altho the name of an old and respectable karacter givs\r\ncredit and consequence to hiz ritings, yet the name of a yung man iz\r\noften prejudicial to hiz performances. By conceeling my name, the\r\nopinions of men hav been prezerved from an undu bias arizing from\r\npersonal prejudices, the faults of the ritings hav been detected, and\r\ntheir merit in public estimation ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe favorable reception given to a number of theze Essays by an\r\nindulgent public, induced me to publish them in a volum, with such\r\nalterations and emendations, az I had heerd suggested by frends or\r\nindifferent reeders, together with some manuscripts, that my own wishes\r\nled me to hope might be useful.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of ten or twelv yeers, I hav been laboring to correct\r\npopular errors, and to assist my yung brethren in the road to truth and\r\nvirtue; my publications for theze purposes hav been numerous; much time\r\nhaz been spent, which I do not regret, and much censure incurred, which\r\nmy hart tells me I do not dezerv. The influence of a yung writer cannot\r\nbe so powerful or extensiv az that of an established karacter; but I hav\r\never thot a man's usefulness depends more on _exertion_ than on\r\n_talents_. I am attached to America by berth, education and habit; but\r\nabuv all, by a philosophical view of her situation, and the superior\r\nadvantages she enjoys, for augmenting the sum of social happiness.\r\n\r\nI should hav added another volum, had not recent experience convinced\r\nme, that few large publications in this country wil pay a printer, much\r\nless an author. Should the Essays here presented to the public, proov\r\nundezerving of notice, I shal, with cheerfulness, resign my other papers\r\nto oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe reeder wil obzerv that the orthography of the volum iz not uniform.\r\nThe reezon iz, that many of the essays hav been published before, in the\r\ncommon orthography, and it would hav been a laborious task to copy the\r\nwhole, for the sake of changing the spelling.\r\n\r\nIn the essays, ritten within the last year, a considerable change of\r\nspelling iz introduced by way of experiment. This liberty waz taken by\r\nthe writers before the age of queen Elizabeth, and to this we are\r\nindeted for the preference of modern spelling over that of Gower and\r\nChaucer. The man who admits that the change of _housbonde_, _mynde_,\r\n_ygone_, _moneth_ into _husband_, _mind_, _gone_, _month_, iz an\r\nimproovment, must acknowlege also the riting of _helth_, _breth_,\r\n_rong_, _tung_, _munth_, to be an improovment. There iz no alternativ.\r\nEvery possible reezon that could ever be offered for altering the\r\nspelling of wurds, stil exists in full force; and if a gradual reform\r\nshould not be made in our language, it wil proov that we are less under\r\nthe influence of reezon than our ancestors.\r\n\r\n_Hartford, June, 1790._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     No. I.\r\n     On the Education of Youth in America.\r\n                                                                    Page\r\n  _General Remarks._                                                   1\r\n  _Division of the Subject.

Education of youth is, in all governments, an object of the first\r\nconsequence. The impressions received in early life, usually form the\r\ncharacters of individuals; a union of which forms the general character\r\nof a nation.\r\n\r\nThe mode of Education and the arts taught to youth, have, in every\r\nnation, been adapted to its particular stage of society or local\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the martial ages of Greece, the principal study of its Legislators\r\nwas, to acquaint the young men with the use of arms, to inspire them\r\nwith an undaunted courage, and to form in the hearts of both sexes, an\r\ninvincible attachment to their country. Such was the effect of their\r\nregulations for these purposes, that the very women of Sparta and\r\nAthens, would reproach their own sons, for surviving their companions\r\nwho fell in the field of battle.\r\n\r\nAmong the warlike Scythians, every male was not only taught to use arms\r\nfor attack and defence; but was obliged to sleep in the field, to carry\r\nheavy burthens, and to climb rocks and precipices, in order to habituate\r\nhimself to hardships, fatigue and danger.\r\n\r\nIn Persia, during the flourishing reign of the great Cyrus, the\r\nEducation of youth, according to Xenophon, formed a principal branch of\r\nthe regulations of the empire. The young men were divided into classes,\r\neach of which had some particular duties to perform, for which they were\r\nqualified by previous instructions and exercise.\r\n\r\nWhile nations are in a barbarous state, they have few wants, and\r\nconsequently few arts. Their principal objects are, defence and\r\nsubsistence; the Education of a savage therefore extends little farther,\r\nthan to enable him to use, with dexterity, a bow and a tomahawk.\r\n\r\nBut in the progress of manners and of arts, war ceases to be the\r\nemployment of whole nations; it becomes the business of a few, who are\r\npaid for defending their country. Artificial wants multiply the number\r\nof occupations; and these require a great diversity in the mode of\r\nEducation. Every youth must be instructed in the business by which he is\r\nto procure subsistence. Even the civilities of behavior, in polished\r\nsociety, become a science; a bow and a curtesy are taught with as much\r\ncare and precision, as the elements of Mathematics. Education proceeds\r\ntherefore, by gradual advances, from simplicity to corruption. Its first\r\nobject, among rude nations, is safety; its next, utility; it afterwards\r\nextends to convenience; and among the opulent part of civilized nations,\r\nit is directed principally to show and amusement.\r\n\r\nIn despotic states, Education, like religion, is made subservient to\r\ngovernment. In some of the vast empires of Asia, children are always\r\ninstructed in the occupation of their parents; thus the same arts are\r\nalways continued in the same families. Such an institution cramps\r\ngenius, and limits the progress of national improvement; at the same\r\ntime it is an almost immoveable barrier against the introduction of\r\nvice, luxury, faction and changes in government. This is one of the\r\nprincipal causes, which have operated in combining numerous millions of\r\nthe human race under one form of government, and preserving national\r\ntranquillity for incredible periods of time. The empire of China, whose\r\ngovernment was founded on the patriarchical discipline, has not suffered\r\na revolution in laws, manners or language, for many thousand years.\r\n\r\nIn the complicated systems of government which are established among the\r\ncivilized nations of Europe, Education has less influence in forming a\r\nnational character; but there is no state, in which it has not an\r\ninseparable connection with morals, and a consequential influence upon\r\nthe peace and happiness of society.\r\n\r\nEducation is a subject which has been exhausted by the ablest writers,\r\nboth among the ancients and moderns. I am not vain enough to suppose I\r\ncan suggest any new ideas upon so trite a theme as Education in general;\r\nbut perhaps the manner of conducting the youth in America may be capable\r\nof some improvement. Our constitutions of civil government are not yet\r\nfirmly established; our national character is not yet formed; and it is\r\nan object of vast magnitude that systems of Education should be adopted\r\nand pursued, which may not only diffuse a knowlege of the sciences, but\r\nmay implant, in the minds of the American youth, the principles of\r\nvirtue and of liberty; and inspire them with just and liberal ideas of\r\ngovernment, and with an inviolable attachment to their own country. It\r\nnow becomes every American to examin the modes of Education in Europe,\r\nto see how far they are applicable in this country, and whether it is\r\nnot possible to make some valuable alterations, adapted to our local and\r\npolitical circumstances. Let us examin the subject in two views. First,\r\nas it respects arts and sciences. Secondly, as it is connected with\r\nmorals and government. In each of these articles, let us see what errors\r\nmay be found, and what improvements suggested, in our present practice.\r\n\r\nThe first error that I would mention, is, a too general attention to the\r\ndead languages, with a neglect of our own.\r\n\r\nThis practice proceeds probably from the common use of the Greek and\r\nRoman tongues, before the English was brought to perfection. There was a\r\nlong period of time, when these languages were almost the only\r\nrepositories of science in Europe. Men, who had a taste for learning,\r\nwere under a necessity of recurring to the sources, the Greek and Roman\r\nauthors. These will ever be held in the highest estimation both for\r\nstile and sentiment; but the most valuable of them have English\r\ntranslations, which, if they do not contain all the elegance,\r\ncommunicate all the ideas of the originals. The English language,\r\nperhaps, at this moment, is the repository of as much learning, as one\r\nhalf the languages of Europe. In copiousness it exceeds all modern\r\ntongues; and though inferior to the Greek and French in softness and\r\nharmony, yet it exceeds the French in variety; it almost equals the\r\nGreek and Roman in energy, and falls very little short of any language\r\nin the regularity of its construction.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] This remark is confined solely to _its construction_; in\r\n    point of orthography, our language is intolerably irregular.\r\n\r\nIn deliberating upon any plan of instruction, we should be attentive to\r\nits future influence and probable advantages. What advantage does a\r\nmerchant, a mechanic, a farmer, derive from an acquaintance with the\r\nGreek and Roman tongues? It is true, the etymology of words cannot be\r\nwell understood, without a knowlege of the original languages of which\r\nours is composed. But a very accurate knowlege of the meaning of words\r\nand of the true construction of sentences, may be obtained by the help\r\nof Dictionaries and good English writers; and this is all that is\r\nnecessary in the common occupations of life. But suppose there is some\r\nadvantage to be derived from an acquaintance with the dead languages,\r\nwill this compensate for the loss of five or perhaps seven years of\r\nvaluable time? Life is short, and every hour should be employed to good\r\npurposes. If there are no studies of more consequence to boys, than\r\nthose of Latin and Greek, let these languages employ their time; for\r\nidleness is the bane of youth. But when we have an elegant and copious\r\nlanguage of our own, with innumerable writers upon ethics, geography,\r\nhistory, commerce and government; subjects immediately interesting to\r\nevery man; how can a parent be justified in keeping his son several\r\nyears over rules of Syntax, which he forgets when he shuts his book; or\r\nwhich, if remembered, can be of little or no use in any branch of\r\nbusiness? This absurdity is the subject of common complaint; men see and\r\nfeel the impropriety of the usual practice; and yet no arguments that\r\nhave hitherto been used, have been sufficient to change the system; or\r\nto place an English school on a footing with a Latin one, in point of\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nIt is not my wish to discountenance totally the study of the dead\r\nlanguages. On the other hand I should urge a more close attention to\r\nthem, among young men who are designed for the learned professions. The\r\npoets, the orators, the philosophers and the historians of Greece and\r\nRome, furnish the most excellent models of Stile, and the richest\r\ntreasures of Science. The slight attention given to a few of these\r\nauthors, in our usual course of Education, is rather calculated to make\r\npedants than scholars; and the time employed in gaining superficial\r\nknowlege is really wasted.[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] In our colleges and universities, students read some of\r\n    the ancient Poets and Orators; but the Historians, which are\r\n    perhaps more valuable, are generally neglected. The student\r\n    just begins to read Latin and Greek to advantage, then quits\r\n    the study. Where is the seminary, in which the students read\r\n    Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius, Dionysius\r\n    Halicarnasseus, Livy, Velleius, Paterculus and Tacitus? How\r\n    superficial must be that learning, which is acquired in four\r\n    years! Severe experience has taught me the errors and defects\r\n    of what is called a liberal education. I could not read the\r\n    best Greek and Roman authors while in college, without\r\n    neglecting the established classical studies; and after I\r\n    left college, I found time only to dip into books, that every\r\n    scholar should be master of; a circumstance that often fills\r\n    me with the deepest regret. \"Quis enim ignorat et eloquentiam\r\n    et cæteras artes descivisse ab ista vetere gloria, non inopia\r\n    hominum, sed desidia juventutis, et negligentia parentum, et\r\n    inscientia præcipientium, et oblivione moris antiqui?--Nec in\r\n    auctoribus cognoscendis, nec in evolvenda antiquitate, nec in\r\n    notitia vel rerum, vel hominum, vel temporum satis operæ\r\n    insumitur.\"--_Tacitus, de Orat. Dial. 28. 29._\r\n\r\n          \"A little learning is a dangerous thing,\r\n          Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.\"\r\n\r\nBut my meaning is, that the dead languages are not necessary for men of\r\nbusiness, merchants, mechanics, planters, &c. nor of utility sufficient\r\nto indemnify them for the expense of time and money which is requisite\r\nto acquire a tolerable acquaintance with the Greek and Roman authors.\r\nMerchants often have occasion for a knowlege of some foreign living\r\nlanguage, as, the French, the Italian, the Spanish, or the German; but\r\nmen, whose business is wholly domestic, have little or no use for any\r\nlanguage but their own; much less, for languages known only in books.\r\n\r\nThere is one very necessary use of the Latin language, which will always\r\nprevent it from falling into neglect; which is, that it serves as a\r\ncommon interpreter among the learned of all nations and ages. Epitaphs,\r\ninscriptions on monuments and medals, treaties, &c. designed for\r\nperpetuity, are written in Latin, which is every where understood by the\r\nlearned, and being a dead language is liable to no change.\r\n\r\nBut the high estimation in which the learned languages have been held,\r\nhas discouraged a due attention to our own. People find themselves able\r\nwithout much study to write and speak the English intelligibly, and thus\r\nhave been led to think rules of no utility. This opinion has produced\r\nvarious and arbitrary practices, in the use of the language, even among\r\nmen of the most information and accuracy; and this diversity has\r\nproduced another opinion, both false and injurious to the language, that\r\nthere are no rules or principles on which the pronunciation and\r\nconstruction can be settled.\r\n\r\nThis neglect is so general, that there is scarcely an institution to be\r\nfound in the country, where the English tongue is taught regularly, from\r\nits elements to its true and elegant construction, in prose and verse.\r\nPerhaps in most schools, boys are taught the definition of the parts of\r\nspeech, and a few hard names which they do not understand, and which the\r\nteacher seldom attempts to explain; this is called _learning grammar_.\r\nThis practice of learning questions and answers without acquiring any\r\nideas, has given rise to a common remark, _that grammar is a dry study_;\r\nand so is every other study which is prosecuted without improving the\r\nhead or the heart. The study of geography is equally dry, when the\r\nsubject is not understood. But when grammar is taught by the help of\r\nvisible objects; when children perceive that differences of words arise\r\nfrom differences in things, which they may learn at a very early period\r\nof life, the study becomes entertaining, as well as improving. In\r\ngeneral, when a study of any kind is tiresome to a person, it is a\r\npresumptive evidence that he does not make any proficiency in knowlege,\r\nand this is almost always the fault of the instructor.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances perhaps the study of English is thought an object of\r\nconsequence; but here also there is a great error in the common\r\npractice; for the study of English is preceded by several years\r\nattention to Latin and Greek. Nay, there are men, who contend that the\r\nbest way to become acquainted with English, is to learn Latin first.\r\nCommon sense may justly smile at such an opinion; but experience proves\r\nit to be false.\r\n\r\nIf language is to be taught mechanically, or by rote, it is a matter of\r\nlittle consequence whether the rules are in English, Latin or Greek: But\r\nif children are to acquire _ideas_, it is certainly easier to obtain\r\nthem in a language which they understand, than in a foreign tongue. The\r\ndistinctions between the principal parts of speech are founded in\r\nnature, and are within the capacity of a school boy. These distinctions\r\nshould be explained in English, and when well understood, will\r\nfacilitate the acquisition of other languages. Without some preparation\r\nof this kind, boys will often find a foreign language extremely\r\ndifficult, and sometimes be discouraged. We often see young persons of\r\nboth sexes, puzzling their heads with French, when they can hardly write\r\ntwo sentences of good English. They plod on for some months with much\r\nfatigue, little improvement, and less pleasure, and then relinquish the\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nThe principles of any science afford pleasure to the student who\r\ncomprehends them. In order to render the study of language agreeable,\r\nthe distinctions between words should be illustrated by the differences\r\nin visible objects. Examples should be presented to the senses, which\r\nare the inlets of all our knowlege. That _nouns are the names of things,\r\nand that adjectives express their qualities_, are abstract definitions,\r\nwhich a boy may repeat five years without comprehending the meaning. But\r\nthat _table_ is the name of an article, and _hard_ or _square_ is its\r\nproperty, is a distinction obvious to the senses, and consequently\r\nwithin a child's capacity.\r\n\r\nThere is one general practice in schools, which I censure with\r\ndiffidence; not because I doubt the propriety of the censure, but\r\nbecause it is opposed to deep rooted prejudices: This practice is the\r\nuse of the Bible as a school book. There are two reasons why this\r\npractice has so generally prevailed: The first is, that families in the\r\ncountry are not generally supplied with any other book: The second, an\r\nopinion that the reading of the scriptures will impress, upon the minds\r\nof youth, the important truths of religion and morality. The first may\r\nbe easily removed; and the purpose of the last is counteracted by the\r\npractice itself.\r\n\r\nIf people design the doctrines of the Bible as a system of religion,\r\nought they to appropriate the book to purposes foreign to this design?\r\nWill not a familiarity, contracted by a careless disrespectful reading\r\nof the sacred volume, weaken the influence of its precepts upon the\r\nheart?\r\n\r\nLet us attend to the effect of familiarity in other things.\r\n\r\nThe rigid Puritans, who first settled the New England States, often\r\nchose their burying ground in the center of their settlements.\r\nConvenience might have been a motive for the choice; but it is probable\r\nthat a stronger reason was, the influence which they supposed the\r\nfrequent burials and constant sight of the tombs would have upon the\r\nlives of men. The choice, however, for the latter purpose, was extremely\r\ninjudicious; for it may be laid down as a general rule, that those who\r\nlive in a constant view of death, will become hardened to its terrors.\r\n\r\nNo person has less sensibility than the Surgeon, who has been accustomed\r\nto the amputation of limbs. No person thinks less of death, than the\r\nSoldier, who has frequently walked over the carcasses of his slain\r\ncomrades; or the Sexton, who lives among the tombs.\r\n\r\nObjects that affect the mind strongly, whether the sensations they\r\nexcite are painful or pleasureable, always lose their effect by a\r\nfrequent repetition of their impressions.[3] Those parts of the\r\nscripture, therefore, which are calculated to strike terror to the mind,\r\nlose their influence by being too frequently brought into view. The same\r\nobjection will not apply to the history and morality of the Bible;\r\nselect passages of which may be read in schools to great advantage. In\r\nsome countries, the common people are not permitted to read the Bible at\r\nall: In ours, it is as common as a newspaper, and in schools, is read\r\nwith nearly the same degree of respect. Both these practices appear to\r\nbe extremes. My wish is not to see the Bible excluded from schools, but\r\nto see it used as a system of religion and morality.\r\n\r\n    [3] The veneration we have for a great character, ceases with\r\n    an intimate acquaintance with the man. The same principle is\r\n    observable in the body. High seasoned food, without frequent\r\n    intervals of abstinence, loses its relish. On the other hand,\r\n    objects that make slight impressions at first, acquire\r\n    strength by repetition. An elegant simplicity in a building\r\n    may not affect the mind with great pleasure at first light;\r\n    but the pleasure will always increase with repeated\r\n    examinations of the structure. Thus by habit, we become\r\n    excessively fond of food which does not relish at first\r\n    tasting; and strong attachments between the sexes often take\r\n    place from indifference, and even from aversion.\r\n\r\nThese remarks suggest another error which is often committed in our\r\ninferior schools: I mean that of putting boys into difficult sciences,\r\nwhile they are too young to exercise their reason upon abstract\r\nsubjects. For example; boys are often put to the study of mathematics,\r\nat the age of eight or ten years; and before they can either read or\r\nwrite. In order to show the impropriety of such a practice, it is\r\nnecessary to repeat what was just now observed, that our senses are the\r\navenues of knowlege. This fact proves that the most natural course of\r\nEducation is that which employs, first the senses or powers of the body,\r\nor those faculties of the mind which first acquire strength; and then\r\nproceeds to those studies which depend on the power of comparing and\r\ncombining ideas. The art of writing is mechanical and imitative; this\r\nmay therefore employ boys, as soon as their fingers have strength\r\nsufficient to command a pen. A knowledge of letters requires the\r\nexercise of a mental power, memory; but this is coeval almost with the\r\nfirst operations of the human mind; and with respect to objects of\r\nsense, is almost perfect even in childhood. Children may therefore be\r\ntaught reading, as soon as their organs of speech have acquired strength\r\nsufficient to articulate the sounds of words.[4]\r\n\r\n    [4] Great caution should be observed in teaching children to\r\n    pronounce the letters of the alphabet. The labials are easily\r\n    pronounced; thus the first words a child can speak are _papa_\r\n    and _mama_. But there are some letters, particularly _l_ and\r\n    _r_, which are of difficult pronunciation, and children\r\n    should not be pressed to speak words in which they occur. The\r\n    difficulty may produce a habit of stammering.\r\n\r\nBut those sciences, a knowlege of which is acquired principally by the\r\nreasoning faculties, should be postponed to a more advanced period of\r\nlife. In the course of an English Education, mathematics should be\r\nperhaps the last study of youth in schools. Years of valuable time are\r\nsometimes thrown away, in a fruitless application to sciences, the\r\nprinciples of which are above the comprehension of the students.\r\n\r\nThere is no particular age, at which every boy is qualified to enter\r\nupon mathematics to advantage. The proper time can be best determined by\r\nthe instructors, who are acquainted with the different capacities of\r\ntheir pupils.\r\n\r\nAnother error, which is frequent in America, is that a master undertakes\r\nto teach many different branches in the same school. In new settlements,\r\nwhere people are poor, and live in scattered situations, the practice is\r\noften unavoidable: But in populous towns, it must be considered as a\r\ndefective plan of Education. For suppose the teacher to be equally\r\nmaster of all the branches which he attempts to teach, which seldom\r\nhappens, yet his attention must be distracted with a multiplicity of\r\nobjects, and consequently painful to himself and not useful to the\r\npupils. Add to this the continual interruptions which the students of\r\none branch suffer from those of another, which must retard the progress\r\nof the whole school. It is a much more eligible plan to appropriate an\r\napartment to each branch of Education, with a teacher who makes that\r\nbranch his sole employment. The principal academies in Europe and\r\nAmerica are on this plan, which both reason and experience prove to be\r\nthe most useful.\r\n\r\nWith respect to literary institutions of the first rank, it appears to\r\nme that their local situations are an object of importance. It is a\r\nsubject of controversy, whether a large city or a country village is the\r\nmost eligible situation for a college or university. But the arguments\r\nin favor of the latter, appear to me decisive. Large cities are always\r\nscenes of dissipation and amusement, which have a tendency to corrupt\r\nthe hearts of youth and divert their minds from their literary pursuits.\r\nReason teaches this doctrine, and experience has uniformly confirmed the\r\ntruth of it.\r\n\r\nStrict discipline is essential to the prosperity of a public seminary of\r\nscience; and this is established with more facility, and supported with\r\nmore uniformity, in a small village, where there are no great objects of\r\ncuriosity to interrupt the studies of youth or to call their attention\r\nfrom the orders of the society.\r\n\r\nThat the morals of young men, as well as their application to science,\r\ndepend much on retirement, will be generally acknowleged; but it will be\r\nsaid also, that the company in large towns will improve their manners.\r\nThe question then is, which shall be sacrificed; the advantage of an\r\n_uncorrupted heart_ and an _improved head_; or of polished manners. But\r\nthis question supposes that the virtues of the heart and the polish of\r\nthe gentleman are incompatible with each other; which is by no means\r\ntrue. The gentleman and the scholar are often united in the same person.\r\nBut both are not formed by the same means. The improvement of the head\r\nrequires close application to books; the refinement of manners rather\r\nattends some degree of dissipation, or at least a relaxation of the\r\nmind. To preserve the purity of the heart, it is sometimes necessary,\r\nand always useful, to place a youth beyond the reach of bad examples;\r\nwhereas a general knowlege of the world, of all kinds of company, is\r\nrequisite to teach a universal propriety of behavior.\r\n\r\nBut youth is the time to form both the head and the heart. The\r\nunderstanding is indeed ever enlarging; but the seeds of knowlege should\r\nbe planted in the mind, while it is young and susceptible; and if the\r\nmind is not kept untainted in _youth_, there is little probability that\r\nthe moral character of the _man_ will be unblemished. A genteel address,\r\non the other hand, _may_ be acquired at any time of life, and _must_ be\r\nacquired, if ever, by mingling with good company. But were the\r\ncultivation of the understanding and of the heart, inconsistent with\r\ngenteel manners, still no rational person could hesitate which to\r\nprefer. The goodness of a heart is of infinitely more consequence to\r\nsociety, than an elegance of manners; nor will any superficial\r\naccomplishments repair the want of principle in the mind. It is always\r\nbetter to be _vulgarly right_, than _politely wrong_.\r\n\r\nBut if the amusements, dissipation and vicious examples in populous\r\ncities render them improper places for seats of learning; the monkish\r\nmode of sequestering boys from other society, and confining them to the\r\napartments of a college, appears to me another fault. The human mind is\r\nlike a rich field, which, without constant care, will ever be covered\r\nwith a luxuriant growth of weeds. It is extremely dangerous to suffer\r\nyoung men to pass the most critical period of life, when the passions\r\nare strong, the judgement weak, and the heart susceptible and\r\nunsuspecting, in a situation where there is not the least restraint upon\r\ntheir inclinations. My own observations lead me to draw the veil of\r\nsilence over the ill effects of this practice. But it is to be wished\r\nthat youth might always be kept under the inspection of age and superior\r\nwisdom; that literary institutions might be so situated, that the\r\nstudents might live in decent families, be subject, in some measure, to\r\ntheir discipline, and ever under the control of those whom they\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may also be numbered among the errors in our systems of\r\nEducation, that, in all our universities and colleges, the students are\r\nall restricted to the same course of study, and by being classed,\r\nlimited to the same progress. Classing is necessary, but whether\r\nstudents should not be removeable from the lower to the higher classes,\r\nas a reward for their superior industry and improvements, is submitted\r\nto those who know the effect of emulation upon the human mind.\r\n\r\nBut young gentlemen are not all designed for the same line of business,\r\nand why should they pursue the same studies? Why should a merchant\r\ntrouble himself with the rules of Greek and Roman syntax, or a planter\r\npuzzle his head with conic sections? Life is too short to acquire, and\r\nthe mind of man too feeble to contain, the whole circle of sciences. The\r\ngreatest genius on earth, not even a Bacon, can be a perfect master of\r\n_every_ branch; but any moderate genius may, by suitable application, be\r\nperfect in any _one_ branch. By attempting therefore to teach young\r\ngentlemen every thing, we make the most of them mere smatterers in\r\nscience. In order to qualify persons to figure in any profession, it is\r\nnecessary that they should attend closely to those branches of learning\r\nwhich lead to it.\r\n\r\nThere are some arts and sciences which are necessary for every man.\r\nEvery man should be able to speak and write his native tongue with\r\ncorrectness; and have some knowlege of mathematics. The rules of\r\narithmetic are indispensably requisite. But besides the learning which\r\nis of common utility, lads should be directed to pursue those branches\r\nwhich are connected more immediately with the business for which they\r\nare destined.\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful for the farming part of the community, to\r\nfurnish country schools with some easy system of practical husbandry. By\r\nrepeatedly reading some book of this kind, the mind would be stored with\r\nideas, which might not indeed be understood in youth, but which would be\r\ncalled into practice in some subsequent period of life. This would lead\r\nthe mind to the subject of agriculture, and pave the way for\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nYoung gentlemen, designed for the mercantile line, after having learned\r\nto write and speak English correctly, might attend to French, Italian,\r\nor such other living language, as they will probably want in the course\r\nof business. These languages should be learned early in youth, while the\r\norgans are yet pliable; otherwise the pronunciation will probably be\r\nimperfect. These studies might be succeeded by some attention to\r\nchronology, and a regular application to geography, mathematics,\r\nhistory, the general regulations of commercial nations, principles of\r\nadvance in trade, of insurance, and to the general principles of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that such a course of Education, which might be\r\ncompleted by the age of fifteen or sixteen, would have a tendency to\r\nmake better merchants than the usual practice which confines boys to\r\nLucian, Ovid and Tully, till they are fourteen, and then turns them into\r\na store, without an idea of their business, or one article of Education\r\nnecessary for them, except perhaps a knowlege of writing and figures.\r\n\r\nSuch a system of English Education is also much preferable to a\r\nuniversity Education, even with the usual honors; for it might be\r\nfinished so early as to leave young persons time to serve a regular\r\napprenticeship, without which no person should enter upon business. But\r\nby the time a university Education is completed, young men commonly\r\ncommence _gentlemen_; their age and their pride will not suffer them to\r\ngo thro the drudgery of a compting house, and they enter upon business\r\nwithout the requisite accomplishments. Indeed it appears to me that what\r\nis now called a _liberal Education_, disqualifies a man for business.\r\nHabits are formed in youth and by practice; and as business is, in some\r\nmeasure, mechanical, every person should be exercised in his employment,\r\nin an early period of life, that his habits may be formed by the time\r\nhis apprenticeship expires. An Education in a university interferes with\r\nthe forming of these habits; and perhaps forms opposite habits; the mind\r\nmay contract a fondness for ease, for pleasure or for books, which no\r\nefforts can overcome. An academic Education, which should furnish the\r\nyouth with some ideas of men and things, and leave time for an\r\napprenticeship, before the age of twenty one years, would in my opinion,\r\nbe the most eligible for young men who are designed for activ\r\nemployments.\r\n\r\nThe method pursued in our colleges is better calculated to fit youth for\r\nthe learned professions than for business. But perhaps the period of\r\nstudy, required as the condition of receiving the usual degrees, is too\r\nshort. Four years, with the most assiduous application, are a short time\r\nto furnish the mind with the necessary knowlege of the languages and of\r\nthe several sciences. It might perhaps have been a period sufficiently\r\nlong for an infant settlement, as America was, at the time when most of\r\nour colleges were founded. But as the country becomes populous, wealthy\r\nand respectable, it may be worthy of consideration, whether the period\r\nof academic life should not be extended to six or seven years.\r\n\r\nBut the principal defect in our plan of Education in America, is, the\r\nwant of good teachers in the academies and common schools. By good\r\nteachers I mean, men of unblemished reputation, and possessed of\r\nabilities, competent to their stations. That a man should be master of\r\nwhat he undertakes to teach, is a point that will not be disputed; and\r\nyet it is certain that abilities are often dispensed with, either thro\r\ninattention or fear of expense.\r\n\r\nTo those who employ ignorant men to instruct their children, permit me\r\nto suggest one important idea: That it is better for youth to have _no_\r\nEducation, than to have a bad one; for it is more difficult to eradicate\r\nhabits, than to impress new ideas. The tender shrub is easily bent to\r\nany figure; but the tree, which has acquired its full growth, resists\r\nall impressions.\r\n\r\nYet abilities are not the sole requisites. The instructors of youth\r\nought, of all men, to be the most prudent, accomplished, agreeable and\r\nrespectable. What avail a man's parts, if, while he is the \"wisest and\r\nbrightest,\" he is the \"meanest of mankind?\" The pernicious effects of\r\nbad example on the _minds_ of youth will probably be acknowleged; but\r\nwith a view to _improvement_, it is indispensably necessary that the\r\nteachers should possess good breeding and agreeable manners. In order to\r\ngive full effect to instructions, it is requisite that they should\r\nproceed from a man who is loved and respected. But a low bred clown, or\r\nmorose tyrant, can command neither love nor respect; and that pupil who\r\nhas no motive for application to books, but the fear of a rod, will not\r\nmake a scholar.\r\n\r\nThe rod is often necessary in school; especially after the children have\r\nbeen accustomed to disobedience and a licentious behavior at home. All\r\ngovernment originates in families, and if neglected there, it will\r\nhardly exist in society; but the want of it must be supplied by the rod\r\nin school, the penal laws of the state, and the terrors of divine wrath\r\nfrom the pulpit. The government both of families and schools should be\r\nabsolute. There should, in families, be no appeal from one parent to\r\nanother, with the prospect of pardon for offences. The one should always\r\nvindicate, at least apparently, the conduct of the other. In schools the\r\nmaster should be absolute in command; for it is utterly impossible for\r\nany man to support order and discipline among children, who are indulged\r\nwith an appeal to their parents. A proper subordination in families\r\nwould generally supersede the necessity of severity in schools; and a\r\nstrict discipline in both is the best foundation of good order in\r\npolitical society.\r\n\r\nIf parents should say, \"we cannot give the instructors of our children\r\nunlimited authority over them, for it may be abused and our children\r\ninjured;\" I would answer, they must not place them under the direction\r\nof any man, in whose temper, judgement and abilities, they do not repose\r\nperfect confidence. The teacher should be, if such can be found, as\r\njudicious and reasonable a man as the parent.\r\n\r\nThere can be little improvement in schools, without strict\r\nsubordination; there can be no subordination, without principles of\r\nesteem and respect in the pupils; and the pupils cannot esteem and\r\nrespect a man who is not in himself respectable, and who is not treated\r\nwith respect by their parents. It may be laid down as an invariable\r\nmaxim, that a person is not fit to superintend the Education of\r\nchildren, who has not the qualifications which will command the esteem\r\nand respect of his pupils. This maxim is founded on a truth which every\r\nperson may have observed; that children always _love_ an _amiable_ man,\r\nand always _esteem_ a _respectable_ one. Men and women have their\r\npassions, which often rule their judgement and their conduct. They have\r\ntheir caprices, their interests and their prejudices, which at times\r\nincline them to treat the most meritorious characters with disrespect.\r\nBut children, artless and unsuspecting, resign their hearts to any\r\nperson whose manners are agreeable, and whose conduct is respectable.\r\nWhenever, therefore, pupils cease to respect their teacher, he should be\r\ninstantly dismissed.\r\n\r\nRespect for an instructor will often supply the place of a rod of\r\ncorrection. The pupil's attachment will lead him to close attention to\r\nhis studies; he fears not the _rod_ so much as the _displeasure_ of his\r\nteacher; he waits for a smile, or dreads a frown; he receives his\r\ninstructions and copies his manners. This generous principle, the fear\r\nof offending, will prompt youth to exertions; and instead of severity on\r\nthe one hand, and of slavish fear, with reluctant obedience on the\r\nother, mutual esteem, respect and confidence strew flowers in the road\r\nto knowlege.\r\n\r\nWith respect to morals and civil society, the other view in which I\r\nproposed to treat this subject, the effects of Education are so certain\r\nand extensiv, that it behooves every parent and guardian to be\r\nparticularly attentiv to the characters of the men, whose province it is\r\nto form the minds of youth.\r\n\r\nFrom a strange inversion of the order of nature, the cause of which it\r\nis not necessary to unfold, the most important business in civil\r\nsociety, is, in many parts of America, committed to the most worthless\r\ncharacters. The Education of youth, an employment of more consequence\r\nthan making laws and preaching the gospel, because it lays the\r\nfoundation on which both law and gospel rest for success; this Education\r\nis sunk to a level with the most menial services. In most instances we\r\nfind the higher seminaries of learning intrusted to men of good\r\ncharacters, and possessed of the moral virtues and social affections.\r\nBut many of our inferior schools, which, so far as the heart is\r\nconcerned, are as important as colleges, are kept by men of no breeding,\r\nand many of them, by men infamous for the most detestable vices.[5] Will\r\nthis be denied? will it be denied, that before the war, it was a\r\nfrequent practice for gentlemen to purchase convicts, who had been\r\ntransported for their crimes, and employ them as private tutors in their\r\nfamilies?\r\n\r\n    [5] How different this practice from the manner of educating\r\n    youth in Rome, during the flourishing ages of the republic!\r\n    There the attention to children commenced with their birth;\r\n    an infant was not educated in the cottage of a hireling\r\n    nurse, but in the very bosom of its mother, whose principal\r\n    praise was, that she superintended her family. Parents were\r\n    careful to choose some aged matron to take care of their\r\n    children; to form their first habits of speaking and acting;\r\n    to watch their growing passions, and direct them to their\r\n    proper objects; to guard them from all immodest sports,\r\n    preserve their minds innocent, and direct their attention to\r\n    liberal pursuits.\r\n\r\n    \"--Filius--non in cella emptæ nutricis sed gremio ac sinu\r\n    matris educabatur, cujus præcipua laus, tueri domum, et\r\n    inservire liberis. Eligebatur autem aliqua major natu\r\n    propinqua, cujus probatis spectatisque moribus, omnis\r\n    cujuspiam familiæ soboles committeretur, coram qua neque\r\n    dicere fas erat quod turpe dictu, neque facere quod\r\n    inhonestum factu videretur. Ac non studia modo curasque, sed\r\n    remissiones etiam lusus que puerorum, sanctitate quadam ac\r\n    verecundia temperabat.\" In this manner were educated the\r\n    Gracchi, Cæsar, and other celebrated Romans. \"Quæ disciplina\r\n    ac severitas eo pertinebat, ut sincera et interga et nullis\r\n    pravitatibus detorta unius cujusque natura, toto statem\r\n    pectore, arriperet artes honestas.\"---- _Tacitus de Orat.\r\n    Dial. 28._\r\n\r\n    The historian then proceeds to mention the corruption of\r\n    manners, and the vicious mode of Education, in the later ages\r\n    of Rome. He says, children were committed to some maid, with\r\n    the vilest slaves; with whom they were initiated in their low\r\n    conversation and manners. \"Horum fabulis et erroribus teneri\r\n    slatim et rudes animi imbuuntur; nec quis quam in toto domo\r\n    pensi habet, quid coram infante domino aut dicat aut\r\n    faciat.\"---- _Ibid. 29._\r\n\r\nGracious Heavens! Must the wretches, who have forfeited their lives, and\r\nbeen pronounced unworthy to be inhabitants of a _foreign_ country, be\r\nentrusted with the Education, the morals, the character of _American_\r\nyouth?\r\n\r\nWill it be denied that many of the instructors of youth, whose examples\r\nand precepts should form their minds for good men and useful citizens,\r\nare often found to sleep away, in school, the fumes of a debauch, and to\r\nstun the ears of their pupils with frequent blasphemy? It is idle to\r\nsuppress such truths; nay more, it is wicked. The practice of employing\r\nlow and vicious characters to direct the studies of youth, is, in a high\r\ndegree, criminal; it is destructive of the order and peace of society;\r\nit is treason against morals, and of course, against government; it\r\nought to be arraigned before the tribunal of reason, and condemned by\r\nall intelligent beings. The practice is so exceedingly absurd, that it\r\nis surprising it could ever have prevailed among rational people.\r\nParents wish their children to be _well bred_, yet place them under the\r\ncare of _clowns_. They wish to secure their hearts from _vicious\r\nprinciples_ and _habits_, yet commit them to the care of men of the most\r\n_profligate lives_. They wish to have their children taught _obedience_\r\nand _respect_ for superiors, yet give them a master that both parents\r\nand children _despise_. A practice so glaringly absurd and irrational\r\nhas no name in any language! Parents themselves will not associate with\r\nthe men, whose company they _oblige_ their children to keep, even in\r\nthat most important period, when habits are forming for life.[6]\r\n\r\n    [6] The practice of employing low characters in schools is\r\n    not novel--Ascham, preceptor to Queen Elizabeth, gives us the\r\n    following account of the practice in his time. \"Pity it is\r\n    that commonly more care is had; yea and that among very wise\r\n    men, to find out rather a cunning man for their horse, than a\r\n    cunning man for their children. They say, nay, in word; but\r\n    they do so, in deed. For to one they will give a stipend of\r\n    two hundred crowns, and loth to offer the other two hundred\r\n    shillings. God, that sitteth in the Heaven, laugheth their\r\n    choice to scorn and rewardeth their liberality as it should:\r\n    for he suffereth them to have _tame_ and _well ordered\r\n    horses_; but _wild_ and _unfortunate children_: and therefore\r\n    in the end they find more pleasure in their horse, than\r\n    comfort in their child.\"\r\n\r\n    This is _old language_, but the facts stated are _modern\r\n    truths_. The barbarous Gothic practice has survived all the\r\n    attacks of common sense, and in many parts of America, a\r\n    gentleman's groom is on a level with his schoolmaster, in\r\n    point of reputation. But hear another authority for the\r\n    practice in England.\r\n\r\n    \"As the case now stands, those of the first quality pay their\r\n    _tutors_ but little above half so much as they do their\r\n    _footmen_.\"--_Guardian_, No. 94.\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis monstrous indeed that men of the best estates and\r\n    families are more solicitous about the tutelage of a favorite\r\n    _dog_ or _horse_, than of their _heirs mate_.\"--_Ibm._\r\n\r\nAre parents and guardians ignorant, that children always imitate those\r\nwith whom they live or associate? That a boy, bred in the woods, will be\r\na savage? That another, bred in the army, will have the manners of a\r\nsoldier? That a third, bred in a kitchen, will speak the language, and\r\npossess the ideas, of servants? And that a fourth, bred in genteel\r\ncompany, will have the manners of a gentleman? We cannot believe that\r\nmany people are ignorant of these truths. Their conduct therefore can be\r\nascribed to nothing but inattention or fear of expense. It is perhaps\r\nliterally true, that a wild life among savages is preferable to an\r\nEducation in a kitchen, or under a drunken tutor; for savages would\r\nleave the mind uncorrupted with the vices, which reign among slaves and\r\nthe depraved part of civilized nations. It is therefore a point of\r\ninfinite importance to society, that youth should not associate with\r\npersons whose manners they ought not to imitate; much less should they\r\nbe doomed to pass the most susceptable period of life, with clowns,\r\nprofligates and slaves.\r\n\r\nThere are people so ignorant of the constitution of our natures, as to\r\ndeclare, that young people should see vices and their consequences, that\r\nthey may learn to detest and shun them. Such reasoning is like that of\r\nthe novel writers, who attempt to defend their delineations of abandoned\r\ncharacters; and that of stage players, who would vindicate the obscene\r\nexhibitions of a theater; but the reasoning is totally false.[7] Vice\r\nalways spreads by being published; young people are taught many vices by\r\nfiction, books or public exhibitions; vices, which they never would have\r\nknown, had they never read such books or attended such public places.\r\nCrimes of all kinds, vices, judicial trials necessarily obscene, and\r\ninfamous punishments, should, if possible, be concealed from the young.\r\nAn examination in a court of justice may teach the tricks of a knave,\r\nthe arts of a thief, and the evasions of hackneyed offenders, to a dozen\r\nyoung culprits, and even tempt those who have never committed a crime,\r\nto make a trial of their skill. A newspaper may spread crimes; by\r\ncommunicating to a nation the knowlege of an ingenious trick of\r\nvillainy, which, had it been suppressed, might have died with its first\r\ninventor. It is not true that the effects of vice and crimes deter\r\nothers from the practice; except when rarely seen. On the other hand,\r\nfrequent exhibitions either cease to make any impressions on the minds\r\nof spectators, or else reconcile them to a course of life, which at\r\nfirst was disagreeable.\r\n\r\n    [7] The fact related by Justin, of an ancient people, will\r\n    apply universally. \"Tanto plus in illis proficit victiorum\r\n    ignoratio, quam in his cognitio virtutis.\" An ignorance of\r\n    vice has a better effect, than a knowlege of virtue.\r\n\r\n          \"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,\r\n          As to be hated, needs but to be seen;\r\n          Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,\r\n          We first endure, then pity, then embrace.\"\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, children should keep the best of company, that they\r\nmight have before them the best manners, the best breeding, and the best\r\nconversation. Their minds should be kept untainted, till their reasoning\r\nfaculties have acquired strength, and the good principles which may be\r\nplanted in their minds, have taken deep root. They will then be able to\r\nmake a firm and probably a successful resistance, against the attacks\r\nof secret corruption and brazen libertinism.\r\n\r\nOur legislators frame laws for the suppression of vice and immorality;\r\nour divines thunder, from the pulpit, the terrors of infinite wrath,\r\nagainst the vices that stain the characters of men. And do laws and\r\npreaching effect a reformation of manners? Experience would not give a\r\nvery favorable answer to this inquiry. The reason is obvious; the\r\nattempts are directed to the wrong objects. Laws can only check the\r\npublic effects of vicious principles; but can never reach the principles\r\nthemselves; and preaching is not very intelligible to people, till they\r\narrive at an age when their principles are rooted, or their habits\r\nfirmly established. An attempt to eradicate old habits, is as absurd, as\r\nto lop off the branches of a huge oak, in order to root it out of a rich\r\nsoil. The most that such clipping will effect, is to prevent a further\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe only practicable method to reform mankind, is to begin with\r\nchildren; to banish, if possible, from their company, every low bred,\r\ndrunken, immoral character. Virtue and vice will not grow together in a\r\ngreat degree, but they will grow where they are planted, and when one\r\nhas taken root, it is not easily supplanted by the other. The great art\r\nof correcting mankind therefore, consists in prepossessing the mind with\r\ngood principles.\r\n\r\nFor this reason society requires that the Education of youth should be\r\nwatched with the most scrupulous attention. Education, in a great\r\nmeasure, forms the moral characters of men, and morals are the basis of\r\ngovernment.[8] Education should therefore be the first care of a\r\nLegislature; not merely the institution of schools, but the furnishing\r\nof them with the best men for teachers. A good system of Education\r\nshould be the first article in the code of political regulations; for it\r\nis much easier to introduce and establish an effectual system for\r\npreserving morals, than to correct, by penal statutes, the ill effects\r\nof a bad system. I am so fully persuaded of this, that I shall almost\r\nadore that great man, who shall change our practice and opinions, and\r\nmake it respectable for the first and best men to superintend the\r\nEducation of youth.\r\n\r\n    [8] Plus ibi boni mores valent, quam alibi bonæ leges.\r\n\r\n    Tac. de Mor. Germ. 19.\r\n\r\nAnother defect in our schools, which, since the revolution, is become\r\ninexcuseable, is the want of proper books. The collections which are now\r\nused consist of essays that respect foreign and ancient nations. The\r\nminds of youth are perpetually led to the history of Greece and Rome or\r\nto Great Britain; boys are constantly repeating the declamations of\r\nDemosthenes and Cicero, or debates upon some political question in the\r\nBritish Parliment. These are excellent specimens of good sense, polished\r\nstile and perfect oratory; but they are not interesting to children.\r\nThey cannot be very useful, except to young gentlemen who want them as\r\nmodels of reasoning and eloquence, in the pulpit or at the bar.\r\n\r\nBut every child in America should be acquainted with his own country. He\r\nshould read books that furnish him with ideas that will be useful to him\r\nin life and practice. As soon as he opens his lips, he should rehearse\r\nthe history of his own country; he should lisp the praise of liberty,\r\nand of those illustrious heroes and statesmen, who have wrought a\r\nrevolution in her favor.\r\n\r\nA selection of essays, respecting the settlement and geography of\r\nAmerica; the history of the late revolution and of the most remarkable\r\ncharacters and events that distinguished it, and a compendium of the\r\nprinciples of the federal and provincial governments, should be the\r\nprincipal school book in the United States. These are interesting\r\nobjects to every man; they call home the minds of youth and fix them\r\nupon the interests of their own country, and they assist in forming\r\nattachments to it, as well as in enlarging the understanding.\r\n\r\n\"It is observed by the great Montesquieu, that the laws of education\r\nought to be relative to the principles of the government.\"[9]\r\n\r\n    [9] Spirit of Laws. Book 4.\r\n\r\nIn despotic governments, the people should have little or no education,\r\nexcept what tends to inspire them with a servile fear. Information is\r\nfatal to despotism.\r\n\r\nIn monarchies, education should be partial, and adapted to the rank of\r\neach class of citizens. But \"in a republican government,\" says the same\r\nwriter, \"the whole power of education is required.\" Here every class of\r\npeople should _know_ and _love_ the laws. This knowlege should be\r\ndiffused by means of schools and newspapers; and an attachment to the\r\nlaws may be formed by early impressions upon the mind.\r\n\r\nTwo regulations are essential to the continuance of republican\r\ngovernments: 1. Such a distribution of lands and such principles of\r\ndescent and alienation, as shall give every citizen a power of acquiring\r\nwhat his industry merits.[10] 2. Such a system of education as gives\r\nevery citizen an opportunity of acquiring knowlege and fitting himself\r\nfor places of trust. These are fundamental articles; the _sine qua non_\r\nof the existence of the American republics.\r\n\r\n    [10] The power of entailing real estates is repugnant to the\r\n    spirit of our American governments.\r\n\r\nHence the absurdity of our copying the manners and adopting the\r\ninstitutions of Monarchies.\r\n\r\nIn several States, we find laws passed, establishing provision for\r\ncolleges and academies, where people of property may educate their sons;\r\nbut no provision is made for instructing the poorer rank of people, even\r\nin reading and writing. Yet in these same States, every citizen who is\r\nworth a few shillings annually, is entitled to vote for legislators.[11]\r\nThis appears to me a most glaring solecism in government. The\r\nconstitutions are _republican_, and the laws of education are\r\n_monarchical_. The _former_ extend civil rights to every honest\r\nindustrious man; the _latter_ deprive a large proportion of the citizens\r\nof a most valuable privilege.\r\n\r\n    [11] I have known instructions from the inhabitants of a\r\n    county, two thirds of whom could not write their names. How\r\n    competent must such men be to decide an important point in\r\n    legislation!\r\n\r\nIn our American republics, where government is in the hands of the\r\npeople, knowlege should be universally diffused by means of public\r\nschools. Of such consequence is it to society, that the people who make\r\nlaws, should be well informed, that I conceive no Legislature can be\r\njustified in neglecting proper establishments for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak of a diffusion of knowlege, I do not mean merely a knowlege\r\nof spelling books, and the New Testament. An acquaintance with ethics,\r\nand with the general principles of law, commerce, money and government,\r\nis necessary for the yeomanry of a republican state. This acquaintance\r\nthey might obtain by means of books calculated for schools, and read by\r\nthe children, during the winter months, and by the circulation of public\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\"In Rome it was the common exercise of boys at school, to learn the laws\r\nof the twelve tables by heart, as they did their poets and classic\r\nauthors.\"[12] What an excellent practice this in a free government!\r\n\r\n    [12] Middleton's life of Cicero, volume 1, page 14.\r\n\r\nIt is said, indeed by many, that our common people are already too well\r\ninformed. Strange paradox! The truth is, they have too much knowlege and\r\nspirit to resign their share in government, and are not sufficiently\r\ninformed to govern themselves in all cases of difficulty.\r\n\r\nThere are some acts of the American legislatures which astonish men of\r\ninformation; and blunders in legislation are frequently ascribed to bad\r\nintentions. But if we examin the men who compose these legislatures, we\r\nshall find that wrong measures generally proceed from ignorance either\r\nin the men themselves, or in their constituents. They often mistake\r\ntheir own interest, because they do not foresee the remote consequences\r\nof a measure.\r\n\r\nIt may be true that all men cannot be legislators; but the more\r\ngenerally knowlege is diffused among the substantial yeomanry, the more\r\nperfect will be the laws of a republican state.\r\n\r\nEvery small district should be furnished with a school, at least four\r\nmonths in a year; when boys are not otherwise employed. This school\r\nshould be kept by the most reputable and well informed man in the\r\ndistrict. Here children should be taught the usual branches of learning:\r\nsubmission to superiors and to laws; the moral or social duties; the\r\nhistory and transactions of their own country; the principles of liberty\r\nand government. Here the rough manners of the wilderness should be\r\nsoftened, and the principles of virtue and good behaviour inculcated.\r\nThe _virtues_ of men are of more consequence to society than their\r\n_abilities_; and for this reason, the _heart_ should be cultivated with\r\nmore assiduity than the _head_.\r\n\r\nSuch a general system of education is neither impracticable nor\r\ndifficult; and excepting the formation of a federal government that\r\nshall be efficient and permanent, it demands the first attention of\r\nAmerican patriots. Until such a system shall be adopted and pursued;\r\nuntil the Statesman and Divine shall unite their efforts in _forming_\r\nthe human mind, rather than in loping its excressences, after it has\r\nbeen neglected; until Legislators discover that the only way to make\r\ngood citizens and subjects, is to nourish them from infancy; and until\r\nparents shall be convinced that the _worst_ of men are not the proper\r\nteachers to make the _best_; mankind cannot know to what a degree of\r\nperfection society and government may be carried. America affords the\r\nfairest opportunities for making the experiment, and opens the most\r\nencouraging prospect of success.[13]\r\n\r\n    [13] It is worthy of remark, that in proportion as laws are\r\n    favorable to the equal rights of men, the number of crimes in\r\n    a state is diminished; except where the human mind is debased\r\n    by extreme servitude, or by superstition. In France, there\r\n    are but few crimes; religion and the rigor of a military\r\n    force prevent them; perhaps also, ignorance in the peasantry\r\n    may be assigned as another reason. But in England and Ireland\r\n    the human mind is not so depressed, yet the distribution of\r\n    property and honors is not equal; the lower classes of\r\n    people, bold and independent, as well as poor, feel the\r\n    injuries which flow from the feudal system, even in its\r\n    relaxed state; they become desperate, and turn highwaymen.\r\n    Hence those kingdoms produce more culprits than half Europe\r\n    besides.\r\n\r\n    The character of the Jews, as sharpers, is derived from the\r\n    cruel and villanous proscriptions, which they have suffered\r\n    from the bigotry of Christians in every part of Europe.\r\n\r\n    Most of the criminals condemned in America are foreigners.\r\n    The execution of a native, before the revolution, was a\r\n    novelty. The distribution of property in America and the\r\n    principles of government favor the rights of men; and but few\r\n    men will commence enemies to society and government, if they\r\n    can receive the benefits of them. Unjust governments and\r\n    tyrannical distinctions have made most of the villains that\r\n    ever existed.\r\n\r\nIn a system of education, that should embrace every part of the\r\ncommunity, the female sex claim no inconsiderable share of our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe women in America (to their honor it is mentioned) are not generally\r\nabove the care of educating their own children. Their own education\r\nshould therefore enable them to implant in the tender mind, such\r\nsentiments of virtue, propriety and dignity, as are suited to the\r\nfreedom of our governments. Children should be treated as children, but\r\nas children that are, in a future time, to be men and women. By treating\r\nthem as if they were always to remain children, we very often see their\r\nchildishness adhere to them, even in middle life. The silly language\r\ncalled _baby talk_, in which most persons are initiated in infancy,\r\noften breaks out in discourse, at the age of forty, and makes a man\r\nappear very ridiculous.[14] In the same manner, vulgar, obscene and\r\nilliberal ideas, imbibed in a nursery or a kitchen, often give a\r\ntincture to the conduct through life. In order to prevent every evil\r\nbias, the ladies, whose province it is to direct the inclinations of\r\nchildren on their first appearance, and to choose their nurses, should\r\nbe possessed, not only of amiable manners, but of just sentiments and\r\nenlarged understandings.\r\n\r\n    [14] It has been already observed that a child always\r\n    imitates what he sees and hears: For this reason, he should\r\n    hear no language which is not correct and decent. Every word\r\n    spoken to a child, should be pronounced with clearness and\r\n    propriety. Banish from children all diminutive words, all\r\n    whining and all bad grammar. A boy of six years old may be\r\n    taught to speak as correctly, as Cicero did before the Roman\r\n    Senate.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of women in forming the dispositions of youth, is not\r\nthe sole reason why their education should be particularly guarded;\r\ntheir influence in controling the manners of a nation, is another\r\npowerful reason. Women, once abandoned, may be instrumental in\r\ncorrupting society; but such is the delicacy of the sex, and such the\r\nrestraints which custom imposes upon them, that they are generally the\r\nlast to be corrupted. There are innumerable instances of men, who have\r\nbeen restrained from a vicious life, and even of very abandoned men, who\r\nhave been reclaimed, by their attachment to ladies of virtue. A fondness\r\nfor the company and conversation of ladies of character, may be\r\nconsidered as a young man's best security against the attractives of a\r\ndissipated life. A man who is attached to _good_ company, seldom\r\nfrequents that which is _bad_. For this reason, society requires that\r\nfemales should be well educated, and extend their influence as far as\r\npossible over the other sex.\r\n\r\nBut a distinction is to be made between a _good_ education, and a\r\n_showy_ one; for an education, merely superficial, is a proof of\r\ncorruption of taste, and has a mischievous influence on manners. The\r\neducation of females, like that of males, should be adapted to the\r\nprinciples of the government, and correspond with the stage of society.\r\nEducation in Paris differs from that in Petersburg, and the education of\r\nfemales in London or Paris should not be a model for the Americans to\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\nIn all nations a _good_ education, is that which renders the ladies\r\ncorrect in their manners, respectable in their families, and agreeable\r\nin society. That education is always _wrong_, which raises a woman above\r\nthe duties of her station.\r\n\r\nIn America, female education should have for its object what is\r\n_useful_. Young ladies should be taught to speak and write their own\r\nlanguage with purity and elegance; an article in which they are often\r\ndeficient. The French language is not necessary for ladies. In some\r\ncases it is convenient, but, in general, it may be considered as an\r\narticle of luxury. As an accomplishment, it may be studied by those\r\nwhose attention is not employed about more important concerns.\r\n\r\nSome knowlege of arithmetic is necessary for every lady. Geography\r\nshould never be neglected. Belles Letters learning seems to correspond\r\nwith the dispositions of most females. A taste for Poetry and fine\r\nwriting should be cultivated; for we expect the most delicate sentiments\r\nfrom the pens of that sex, which is possessed of the finest feelings.\r\n\r\nA course of reading can hardly be prescribed for all ladies. But it\r\nshould be remarked, that this sex cannot be too well acquainted with the\r\nwriters upon human life and manners. The Spectator should fill the first\r\nplace in every lady's library. Other volumes of periodical papers, tho\r\ninferior to the Spectator, should be read; and some of the best\r\nhistories.\r\n\r\nWith respect to novels, so much admired by the young, and so generally\r\ncondemned by the old, what shall I say? Perhaps it may be said with\r\ntruth, that some of them are useful, many of them pernicious, and most\r\nof them trifling. A hundred volumes of modern novels may be read,\r\nwithout acquiring a new idea. Some of them contain entertaining stories,\r\nand where the descriptions are drawn from nature, and from characters\r\nand events in themselves innocent, the perusal of them may be harmless.\r\n\r\nWere novels written with a view to exhibit only one side of human\r\nnature, to paint the social virtues, the world would condemn them as\r\ndefective: But I should think them more perfect. Young people,\r\nespecially females, should not see the vicious part of mankind. At best\r\nnovels may be considered as the toys of youth; the rattle boxes of\r\nsixteen. The mechanic gets his pence for his toys, and the novel writer,\r\nfor his books; and it would be happy for society, if the latter were in\r\nall cases as innocent play things as the former.\r\n\r\nIn the large towns in America, music, drawing and dancing, constitute a\r\npart of female education. They, however, hold a subordinate rank; for my\r\nfair friends will pardon me, when I declare, that no man ever marries a\r\nwoman for her performance on a harpsichord, or her figure in a minuet.\r\nHowever ambitious a woman may be to command admiration _abroad_, her\r\nreal merit is known only at _home_. Admiration is useless, when it is\r\nnot supported by domestic worth. But real honor and permanent esteem,\r\nare always secured by those who preside over their own families with\r\ndignity.[15]\r\n\r\n    [15] Nothing can be more fatal to domestic happiness in\r\n    America, than a taste for copying the luxurious manners and\r\n    amusements of England and France. Dancing, drawing and music,\r\n    are principal articles of education in those kingdoms;\r\n    therefore every girl in America must pass two or three years\r\n    at a boarding school, tho her father cannot give her a\r\n    farthing when she marries. This ambition to educate females\r\n    above their fortunes pervades every part of America. Hence\r\n    the disproportion between the well bred females and the males\r\n    in our large towns. A mechanic or shopkeeper in town, or a\r\n    farmer in the country, whose sons get their living by their\r\n    father's employments, will send their daughters to a boarding\r\n    school, where their ideas are elevated, and their views\r\n    carried above a connexion with men in those occupations. Such\r\n    an education, without fortune or beauty, may possibly please\r\n    a girl of fifteen, but must prove her greatest misfortune.\r\n    This fatal mistake is illustrated in every large town in\r\n    America. In the country, the number of males and females, is\r\n    nearly equal; but in towns, the number of genteelly bred\r\n    women is greater than of men; and in some towns, the\r\n    proportion is, as three to one.\r\n\r\n    The heads of young people of both sexes are often turned by\r\n    reading descriptions of splendid living, of coaches, of\r\n    plays, and other amusements. Such descriptions excite a\r\n    desire to enjoy the same pleasures. A fortune becomes the\r\n    principal object of pursuit; fortunes are scarce in America,\r\n    and not easily acquired; disappointment succeeds, and the\r\n    youth who begins life with expecting to enjoy a coach, closes\r\n    the prospect with a small living, procured by labor and\r\n    economy.\r\n\r\n    Thus a wrong education, and a taste for pleasures which our\r\n    fortune will not enable us to enjoy, often plunge the\r\n    Americans into distress, or at least prevent early marriages.\r\n    Too fond of show, of dress and expense, the sexes wish to\r\n    please each other; they mistake the means, and both are\r\n    disappointed.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit this subject, I beg leave to make some remarks on a\r\npractice which appears to be attended with important consequences; I\r\nmean that of sending boys to Europe for an education, or sending to\r\nEurope for teachers. This was right before the revolution; at least so\r\nfar as national attachments where concerned; but the propriety of it\r\nceased with our political relation to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, our honor as an independent nation is concerned in\r\nthe establishment of literary institutions, adequate to all our own\r\npurposes; without sending our youth abroad, or depending on other\r\nnations for books and instructors. It is very little to the reputation\r\nof America to have it said abroad, that after the heroic atchievements\r\nof the late war, these independent people are obliged to send to Europe\r\nfor men and books to teach their children A B C.\r\n\r\nBut in another point of view, a foreign education is directly opposite\r\nto our political interests, and ought to be discountenanced, if not\r\nprohibited.\r\n\r\nEvery person of common observation will grant, that most men prefer the\r\nmanners and the government of that country where they are educated. Let\r\nten American youths be sent, each to a different European kingdom, and\r\nlive there from the age of twelve to twenty, and each will give the\r\npreference to the country where he has resided.\r\n\r\nThe period from twelve to twenty is the most important in life. The\r\nimpressions made before that period are commonly effaced; those that are\r\nmade during that period _always_ remain for many years; and _generally_\r\nthro life.\r\n\r\nNinety nine persons of a hundred who pass that period in England or\r\nFrance, will prefer the people, their manners, their laws, and their\r\ngovernment, to those of their nativ country. Such attachments are\r\ninjurious, both to the happiness of the men, and to the political\r\ninterests of their own country. As to private happiness, it is\r\nuniversally known how much pain a man suffers by a change of habits in\r\nliving. The customs of Europe are and ought to be different from ours;\r\nbut when a man has been bred in one country, his attachments to its\r\nmanners make them, in a great measure, necessary to his happiness. On\r\nchanging his residence, he must therefore break his former habits, which\r\nis always a painful sacrifice; or the discordance between the manners\r\nof his own country, and his habits, must give him incessant uneasiness;\r\nor he must introduce, into a circle of his friends, the manners in which\r\nhe was educated. These consequences may follow, and the last, which is\r\ninevitable, is a public injury. The refinement of manners in every\r\ncountry should keep pace exactly with the increase of its wealth; and\r\nperhaps the greatest evil America now feels is, an improvement of taste\r\nand manners which its wealth cannot support.\r\n\r\nA foreign education is the very source of this evil; it gives young\r\ngentlemen of fortune a relish for manners and amusements which are not\r\nsuited to this country; which however, when introduced by this class of\r\npeople, will always become fashionable.\r\n\r\nBut a corruption of manners is not the sole objection to a foreign\r\neducation: An attachment to a _foreign_ government, or rather a want of\r\nattachment to our _own_, is the natural effect of a residence abroad,\r\nduring the period of youth. It is recorded of one of the Greek cities,\r\nthat in a treaty with their conquerors, it was required that they should\r\ngive a certain number of _male children_ as hostages for the fulfilment\r\nof their engagements. The Greeks absolutely refused, on the principle\r\nthat these children would imbibe the ideas and embrace the manners of\r\nforeigners, or lose their love for their own country: But they offered\r\nthe same number of _old_ men, without hesitation. This anecdote is full\r\nof good sense. A man should always form his habits and attachments in\r\nthe country where he is to reside for life. When these habits are\r\nformed, young men may travel without danger of losing their patriotism.\r\nA boy who lives in England from twelve to twenty, will be an\r\n_Englishman_ in his manners and his feelings; but let him remain at home\r\ntill he is twenty, and form his attachments, he may then be several\r\nyears abroad, and still be an _American_.[16] There may be exceptions to\r\nthis observation; but living examples may be mentioned to prove the\r\ntruth of the general principle here advanced, respecting the influence\r\nof habit.\r\n\r\n    [16] Cicero was twenty eight years old when he left Italy to\r\n    travel into Greece and Asia. \"He did not stir abroad,\" says\r\n    Dr. Middleton, \"till he had completed his education at home;\r\n    for nothing can be more pernicious to a nation, than the\r\n    necessity of a foreign one.\"--_Life of Cicero, vol. 1. p.\r\n    48._\r\n\r\n    Dr. Moore makes a remark precisely in point. Speaking of a\r\n    foreign education, proposed by a certain Lord, who objected\r\n    to the public schools in England, he says, \"I have attended\r\n    to his Lordship's objections, and after due consideration,\r\n    and weighing every circumstance, I remain of opinion, that no\r\n    country but Great Britain is proper for the education of a\r\n    British subject, who proposes to pass his life in his own\r\n    country. The most important point, in my mind, to be secured\r\n    in the education of a young man of rank of our country, is to\r\n    make him an Englishman; and this can be done no where so\r\n    effectually as in England.\" See his _View of Society and\r\n    Manners_, &c. vol. 1, page 197, where the reader will find\r\n    many judicious remarks upon this subject. The following are\r\n    too pertinent to be omitted.--\"It is thought, that by an\r\n    early foreign education, all ridiculous English prejudices,\r\n    will be avoided. This may be true; but other prejudices,\r\n    perhaps as ridiculous, and much more detrimental, will be\r\n    formed. The first cannot be attended with many\r\n    inconveniencies; the second may render the young people\r\n    unhappy in their own country when they return, and\r\n    disagreeable to their countrymen all the rest of their\r\n    lives.\" These remarks, by a change of names are applicable to\r\n    America.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that foreign universities furnish much better\r\nopportunities of improvement in the sciences than the American. This may\r\nbe true, and yet will not justify the practice of sending young lads\r\nfrom their own country. There are some branches of science which may be\r\nstudied to much greater advantage in Europe than in America,\r\nparticularly chymistry. When these are to be acquired, young gentlemen\r\nought to spare no pains to attend the best professors. It may,\r\ntherefore, be useful, in some cases, for students to cross the atlantic\r\nto _complete_ a course of studies; but it is not necessary for them to\r\ngo early in life, nor to continue a long time. Such instances need not\r\nbe frequent even now; and the necessity for them will diminish in\r\nproportion to the future advancement of literature in America.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, much questioned, whether, in the ordinary course of\r\nstudy, a young man can enjoy greater advantages in Europe than in\r\nAmerica. Experience inclines me to raise a doubt, whether the danger to\r\nwhich a youth must be exposed among the sons of dissipation abroad, will\r\nnot turn the scale in favor of our American colleges. Certain it is,\r\nthat four fifths of the great literary characters in America never\r\ncrossed the atlantic.\r\n\r\nBut if our universities and schools are not so good as the English or\r\nScotch, it is the business of our rulers to improve them, not to endow\r\nthem merely; for endowments alone will never make a flourishing\r\nseminary; but to furnish them with professors of the first abilities and\r\nmost assiduous application, and with a complete apparatus for\r\nestablishing theories by experiments. Nature has been profuse to the\r\nAmericans, in genius, and in the advantages of climate and soil. If this\r\ncountry, therefore, should long be indebted to Europe for opportunities\r\nof acquiring any branch of science in perfection, it must be by means of\r\na criminal neglect of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the nature of the American and European governments,\r\nis another objection to a foreign education. Men form modes of\r\nreasoning, or habits of thinking on political subjects, in the country\r\nwhere they are bred; these modes of reasoning may be founded on fact in\r\nall countries; but the same principles will not apply in all\r\ngovernments, because of the infinite variety of national opinions and\r\nhabits. Before a man can be a good Legislator, he must be intimately\r\nacquainted with the temper of the people to be governed. No man can be\r\nthus acquainted with a people, without residing amongst them and\r\nmingling with all companies. For want of this acquaintance, a Turgot and\r\na Price may reason most absurdly upon the Constitutions of the American\r\nstates; and when any person has been long accustomed to believe in the\r\npropriety or impropriety of certain maxims or regulations of government,\r\nit is very difficult to change his opinions, or to persuade him to adapt\r\nhis reasoning to new and different circumstances.\r\n\r\nOne half the European Protestants will now contend that the Roman\r\nCatholic religion is subversive of civil government. Tradition, books,\r\neducation, have concurred to fix this belief in their minds; and they\r\nwill not resign their opinions, even in America, where some of the\r\nhighest civil offices are in the hands of Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore of infinite importance that those who direct the\r\ncouncils of a nation, should be educated in that nation. Not that they\r\nshould restrict their personal acquaintance to their own country, but\r\ntheir first ideas, attachments and habits should be acquired in the\r\ncountry which they are to govern and defend. When a knowlege of their\r\nown country is obtained, and an attachment to its laws and interests\r\ndeeply fixed in their hearts, then young gentlemen may travel with\r\ninfinite advantage and perfect safety. I wish not therefore to\r\ndiscourage travelling, but, if possible, to render it more useful to\r\nindividuals and to the community. My meaning is, that _men_ should\r\ntravel, and not _boys_.\r\n\r\nIt is time for the Americans to change their usual route, and travel\r\nthro a country which they never think of, or think beneeth their notice:\r\nI mean the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile these States were a part of the British Empire, our interest, our\r\nfeelings, were those of Englishmen; our dependence led us to respect and\r\nimitate their manners, and to look up to them for our opinions. We\r\nlittle thought of any national interest in America; and while our\r\ncommerce and governments were in the hands of our parent country, and we\r\nhad no common interest, we little thought of improving our acquaintance\r\nwith each other, or of removing prejudices, and reconciling the\r\ndiscordant feelings of the inhabitants of different Provinces. But\r\nindependence and union render it necessary that the citizens of\r\ndifferent States should know each others characters and circumstances;\r\nthat all jealousies should be removed; that mutual respect and\r\nconfidence should succeed, and a harmony of views and interests be\r\ncultivated by a friendly intercourse.\r\n\r\nA tour thro the United States ought now to be considered as a necessary\r\npart of a liberal education. Instead of sending young gentlemen to\r\nEurope to view curiosities and learn vices and follies, let them spend\r\ntwelve or eighteen months in examining the local situation of the\r\ndifferent States; the rivers, the soil, the population, the improvements\r\nand commercial advantages of the whole; with an attention to the spirit\r\nand manners of the inhabitants, their laws, local customs and\r\ninstitutions. Such a tour should at least precede a tour to Europe; for\r\nnothing can be more ridiculous than a man travelling in a foreign\r\ncountry for information, when he can give no account of his own. When,\r\ntherefore, young gentlemen have finished an academic education, let them\r\ntravel thro America, and afterwards to Europe, if their time and\r\nfortunes will permit. But if they cannot make a tour thro both, that in\r\nAmerica is certainly to be preferred; for the people of America, with\r\nall their information, are yet extremely ignorant of the geography,\r\npolicy and manners of their neighbouring States. Except a few gentlemen\r\nwhose public employments in the army and in Congress, have extended\r\ntheir knowlege of America, the people in this country, even of the\r\nhigher classes, have not so correct information respecting the United\r\nStates, as they have respecting England or France. Such ignorance is not\r\nonly disgraceful, but is materially prejudicial to our political\r\nfriendship and federal operations.\r\n\r\nAmericans, unshackle your minds, and act like independent beings. You\r\nhave been children long enough, subject to the control, and subservient\r\nto the interest of a haughty parent. You have now an interest of your\r\nown to augment and defend: You have an empire to raise and support by\r\nyour exertions, and a national character to establish and extend by your\r\nwisdom and virtues. To effect these great objects, it is necessary to\r\nframe a liberal plan of policy, and build it on a broad system of\r\neducation. Before this system can be formed and embraced, the Americans\r\nmust _believe_, and _act_ from the belief, that it is dishonorable to\r\nwaste life in mimicking the follies of other nations and basking in the\r\nsunshine of foreign glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, 1788.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES of GOVERNMENT _and_ COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll mankind are, by nature, free, and have a right to enjoy life,\r\nliberty and property.\r\n\r\nOne person has no right to take from another his life, health, peace, or\r\ngood name; to take away or lessen his freedom of thinking and acting, or\r\nto injure his estate in the smallest degree.\r\n\r\nA collection of individuals forms a _society_; and every society must\r\nhave _government_, to prevent one man from hurting another, and to\r\npunish such as commit crimes. Every person's safety requires that he\r\nshould submit to be governed; for if one man may do harm without\r\nsuffering punishment, every man has the same right, and no person can be\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary therefore that there should be laws to control every\r\nman. Laws should be made by consent or concurrence of the greatest part\r\nof the society.\r\n\r\nThe whole body of people in society is the sovereign power or state;\r\nwhich is called, the body politic. Every man forms a part of this state,\r\nand so has a share in the sovereignty; at the same time, as an\r\nindividual, he is a subject of the state.\r\n\r\nWhen a society is large, the whole state cannot meet together for the\r\npurpose of making laws; the people therefore agree to appoint deputies,\r\nor representativs, to act for them. When these agents are chosen and met\r\ntogether, they represent the whole state, and act as the sovereign\r\npower. The people resign their own authority to their representativs;\r\nthe acts of these deputies are in effect the acts of the people; and the\r\npeople have no right to refuse obedience.\r\n\r\nIt is as wrong to refuse obedience to the laws made by our\r\n_representativs_, as it would be to break laws made by _ourselves_. If\r\na law is bad and produces general harm, the people may appoint new\r\ndeputies to repeal it; but while it is a law, it is the act and will of\r\nthe sovereign power, and ought to be obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe people in free governments, make their own laws by agents or\r\nrepresentativs, and appoint the executiv officers. An executiv officer\r\nis armed with the authority of the whole state and cannot be resisted.\r\nHe cannot do wrong, unless he goes beyond the bounds of the laws.\r\n\r\nAn executiv officer can hardly be too arbitrary; for if the laws are\r\ngood, they should be strictly executed and religiously obeyed: If they\r\nare bad, the people can alter or repeal them; or if the officer goes\r\nbeyond his powers, he is accountable to those who appoint him. A neglect\r\nof good and wholesome laws is the bane of society.\r\n\r\nJudges and all executiv officers should be made as much as possible,\r\nindependent of the will of the people at large. They should be chosen by\r\nthe representativs of the people and answerable to them only: For if\r\nthey are elected by the people, they are apt to be swayed by fear and\r\naffection; they may dispense with the laws, to favor their friends, or\r\nsecure their office. Besides, their election is apt to occasion party\r\nspirit, cabals, bribery and public disorder. These are great evils in a\r\nstate, and defeat the purposes of government.\r\n\r\nThe people have a right to advise their representativs in certain cases,\r\nin which they may be well informed. But this right cannot often be\r\nexercised with propriety or safety: Nor should their instructions be\r\nbinding on their representativs: For the people, most of whom live\r\nremote from each other, cannot always be acquainted with the general\r\ninterest of the state; they cannot know all the reasons and arguments\r\nwhich may be offered for, or against a measure, by people in distant\r\nparts of the state; they cannot tell at home, how they _themselves_\r\nwould think and act, in a general assembly of _all_ the citizens.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, if the people of a certain district, bind their\r\nrepresentativ to vote in a particular manner, they may bind him to do\r\n_wrong_. They make up their minds, upon a partial view of facts, and\r\nform a resolution, which they themselves, on a fair state of all the\r\nfacts, in the general assembly, might see reasons to change. There have\r\nbeen instances, in which these binding, positiv instructions, have\r\nobliged a representativ to give his vote, contrary to the conviction of\r\nhis own mind and what he thought the good of the state; consequently his\r\nvote was a violation of his oath.\r\n\r\nBut the opinions of the people should, if possible, be collected; for\r\nthe general sense of a nation is commonly right. When people are well\r\ninformed, their general opinion is perhaps always right. But they may be\r\nuninformed or misinformed and consequently their measures may be\r\nrepugnant to their own interest. This is often the case, with particular\r\ndistricts of people; and hence the bad policy of giving binding\r\ninstructions to representativs. The sense of a nation is collected by\r\nthe opinions of people in particular districts; but as some of these\r\nopinions may be wrong, a representativ should be left with discretionary\r\npowers to act for the good of the state.\r\n\r\nRepresentativs are chosen by the inhabitants of certain districts,\r\nbecause this is most convenient: But when they act as lawgivers, they\r\nact for the whole state. When a man is considering the propriety of a\r\ngeneral measure, he is not to be influenced by the interest of a single\r\ndistrict or part of a state; but by the collectiv interest of the whole\r\nstate. A good lawgiver will not ask solely what is _my_ interest, or the\r\ninterest of _my_ town or constituents? but, what will promote the\r\ninterest of the community; '_what will produce the greatest possible\r\ngood, to the greatest number of people_?'\r\n\r\nWhen a legislativ body makes _laws_, it acts for _itself_ only, and can\r\nalter or repeal the laws when they become inconvenient. But when it\r\nmakes _grants_ or _contracts_, it act as a party, and cannot take back\r\nits grant, or change the nature of its contracts, without the consent of\r\nthe other party. A state has no more right to neglect or refuse to\r\nfulfil its engagements, than an individual. There may be an exception\r\nin the case of a grant, for if a state has made a grant, which, contrary\r\nto its expectations, clearly endangers the safety of the community, it\r\nmay resume that grant. The public safety is a consideration superior to\r\nall others. But the danger must be great and obvious; it must be\r\ngenerally seen and felt, before the state can be justified in recalling\r\nits grant. To take back a gift, or break a contract, for small causes or\r\nslight inconveniencies, is a most wanton abuse of power. Bargains,\r\nconveyances, and voluntary grants, where two parties are concerned, are\r\n_sacred things_; they are the supports of social confidence and\r\nsecurity; they ought not to be sported with, because one party is\r\nstronger than the other; they should be religiously observed.\r\n\r\nAs the state has no right to break its own promises, so it has no right\r\nto alter the promises of individuals. When one man has engaged to pay\r\nhis debt in wheat, and his creditor expects the promise to be fulfiled,\r\nthe legislature has no right to say, the debt shall be paid in flax or\r\nhorses. Such an act saps all the supports of good faith between man and\r\nman; it is the worst kind of tyranny.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, all _tender laws_, which oblige a creditor to take, for\r\nhis debt, some article which he never intended nor engaged to take, are\r\nhighly _unjust_ and _tyrannical_. The intention of the contracting\r\nparties should be strictly regarded; the state may enforce that\r\nintention, but can never have a right to interfere and defeat it. A\r\nlegislature has no right to put a bargain on any footing, but that on\r\nwhich the parties _have_ placed it or _are willing_ to place it.\r\n\r\nIf a state is poor, and people owe more money than can be procured, a\r\nlegislature may perhaps go so far as to suspend the collection of debts;\r\nor to ordain that a certain part only of the debts shall be recoverable\r\nimmediately, and the payment of the remainder suspended. This may ease\r\nthe debtors; but can be justified in extreme cases only, when the people\r\nare generally and greatly involved.\r\n\r\nA people should not generally be in debt: The consumers of goods should\r\nnot get credit. Heavy and numerous debts are great evils to a state. If\r\nthe people will giv and take extensiv credit, the state should check\r\ntheir imprudence, by putting debts out of the protection of law. When it\r\nbecomes a practice to collect debts by law, it is a proof of corruption\r\nand degeneracy among the people. Laws and courts are necessary to settle\r\ncontroverted points between man and man; but a man should pay an\r\nacknowledged debt, not because there is a law to oblige him, but because\r\nit is _just_ and _honest_, and because he has PROMISED to pay it.\r\n\r\nMoney, or a medium in trade, is necessary in all great states; but _too\r\nmuch_ is a greater evil than _too little_. When people can get money\r\nwithout labor, they neglect business and become idle, prodigal and\r\nvicious; and when they have nothing but money, they are poor indeed.\r\nSpain was ruined by its mines of gold and silver in South America. That\r\nkingdom possessed all the money in Europe, and yet was the _poorest_; it\r\nwill never be rich and flourishing, till its mines are exhausted. The\r\ndiscovery of rich mines in this country, would be the greatest\r\nmisfortune, that can befall the United States.\r\n\r\nMoney is a mere representativ of property; it is the _change_ which\r\nfacilitates trade. But the _wealth_ of a country is its _produce_; and\r\nits strength consists in the number of its industrious inhabitants. A\r\nman cannot become rich, unless he earns more than he spends. It is the\r\nsame with a country. The labouring men are the support of a nation.\r\n\r\nThe value of money depends on the quantity in circulation. A medium of\r\ntrade respects all commercial nations; and like water, it will find its\r\nlevel. Money will go where it is wanted, if the people have any thing to\r\npurchase it. If one state or country has more money than another, it is\r\na proof that the people are more industrious or saving. It would be\r\nhappy for the world, if no more money could be made: There is already\r\ntoo much. Silver is become very burdensome, merely because there is too\r\nmuch in the world. If there were but one quarter of the money which now\r\ncirculates, one quarter of a dollar would buy as much as a dollar will\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nHence the mistaken policy of those people who attempt to increase the\r\nmedium of trade by coinage or by a paper currency. They can add to the\r\nquantity, as much as they please; but not to the value. If America were\r\nshut out from all intercourse with other nations, and ten millions of\r\ndollars were circulating in the country, every article of life would\r\nhave a certain price. If in this case, wheat should be one dollar a\r\nbushel, let the money be instantly doubled, the price of wheat would\r\nthen be two dollars, and the price of every article would rise in the\r\nsame proportion. So that twenty millions of dollars would be worth no\r\nmore than ten, because they would buy no more of the useful commodities:\r\nAmerica would be no richer in the one case than in the other.\r\n\r\nBut as there is a communication with other nations, a million of\r\ndollars, added to the circulating specie, does not increase the\r\npermanent medium in quantity; for just so much money as is added, will\r\nleave the country. If there is too much money in a country, the price of\r\nlabor will rise, and the produce cannot find market abroad without a\r\nloss. This was the case with American produce, at the close of the war.\r\nIf money is scarce in a country, the price of labor will be low, and\r\nconsequently the produce of that country will be cheap at home, and a\r\ngreat profit will be made on the exportation. This profit will be\r\nreturned, partly in goods and partly in money, and the country is\r\nenriched.\r\n\r\nBut the great principle, which should constitute the corner stone of\r\ngovernment, is _public justice_. The fountain head should be pure, or\r\nthe streams will be foul indeed. That Legislatures, or bodies politic,\r\nshould make laws, annex penalties for disobedience, institute courts for\r\ndeciding controversies and trying offenders, and execute punishments on\r\nthose that are convicted; yet at the same time neglect to do justice\r\nthemselves by paying their own debts; this is of all absurdities the\r\nmost glaring. To compel individuals to perform contracts and yet break\r\ntheir own solemn promises; to punish individuals for neglect, and yet\r\nset a general example of delinquency, is to undermine the foundation of\r\nsocial confidence, and shake every principle of commutativ justice.\r\n\r\nThese are general principles in government and trade, and ought to be\r\ndeeply impressed upon the minds of every American.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. III.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, 1788.\r\n\r\nBILLS _of_ RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objections to the new Federal Constitution, is,\r\nthat it contains no _Bill of Rights_. This objection, I presume to\r\nassert, is founded on ideas of government that are totally false. Men\r\nseem determined to adhere to old prejudices, and reason _wrong_, because\r\nour ancestors reasoned _right_. A Bill of Rights against the\r\nencroachments of Kings and Barons, or against any power independent of\r\nthe people, is perfectly intelligible; but a Bill of Rights against the\r\nencroachments of an electiv Legislature, that is, against our _own_\r\nencroachments on _ourselves_, is a curiosity in government.\r\n\r\nThe English nation, from which we descended, have been gaining their\r\nliberties, inch by inch, by forcing concessions from the crown and the\r\nBarons, during the course of six centuries.[17] _Magna Charta_, which is\r\ncalled the palladium of English liberty, was dated in 1215, and the\r\npeople of England were not represented in Parliament till the year 1265.\r\nMagna Charta established the rights of the Barons and clergy against the\r\nencroachments of royal perogativ; but the commons or people were hardly\r\nnoticed in that deed. There was but one clause in their favor, which\r\nstipulated, that \"no villain or rustic should, by any fine, be bereaved\r\nof his carts, plows and instruments of husbandry.\" As for the rest, they\r\nwere considered as a part of the property belonging to an estate, and\r\nwere transferred, as other moveables, at the will of their owners. In\r\nthe succeeding reign, they were permitted to send Representativs to\r\nParliament; and from that time have been gradually assuming their proper\r\ndegree of consequence in the British Legislature. In such a nation,\r\nevery law or statute that defines the powers of the crown, and\r\ncircumscribes them within determinate limits, must be considered as a\r\nbarrier to guard popular liberty. Every acquisition of freedom must be\r\nestablished as a _right_, and solemnly recognized by the supreme power\r\nof the nation; lest it should be again resumed by the crown under\r\npretence of ancient prerogativ: For this reason, the habeas corpus act\r\npassed in the reign of Charles 2d, the statute of the 2d of William and\r\nMary, and many others which are declaratory of certain privileges, are\r\njustly considered as the pillars of English freedom.\r\n\r\n    [17] Not that the English nation was originally in slavery;\r\n    for the primitiv Saxons and Germans were free. But the\r\n    military tenures, established by the Gothic conquests,\r\n    depressed the people; so that under the rigor of the feudal\r\n    system, about the date of Magna Charta, the King and Nobles\r\n    held their tenants in extreme servitude. From this\r\n    depression, the English have gradually emerged into ancient\r\n    freedom.\r\n\r\nThese statutes are however not esteemed because they are unalterable;\r\nfor the same power that enacted them, can at any moment repeal them; but\r\nthey are esteemed, because they are barriers erected by the\r\nRepresentativs of the nation, against a power that exists independent of\r\ntheir own choice.\r\n\r\nBut the same reasons for such declaratory constitutions do not\r\nexist in America, where the supreme power is _the people in their\r\nRepresentativs_. The _Bills of Rights_, prefixed to several of the\r\nconstitutions of the United States, if considered as assigning the\r\nreasons of our separation from a foreign government, or as solemn\r\ndeclarations of right against the encroachments of a foreign\r\njurisdiction, are perfectly rational, and were doubtless necessary. But\r\nif they are considered as barriers against the encroachments of our own\r\nLegislatures, or as constitutions unalterable by posterity, I venture to\r\npronounce them nugatory, and to the last degree, absurd.\r\n\r\nIn our governments, there is no power of legislation, independent of the\r\npeople; no power that has an interest detached from that of the public;\r\nconsequently there is no power existing against which it is necessary to\r\nguard. While our Legislatures therefore remain electiv, and the rulers\r\nhave the same interest in the laws, as the subjects have, the rights of\r\nthe people will be perfectly secure without any declaration in their\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the principal point. I undertake to prove that a\r\nstanding _Bill of Rights_ is _absurd_, because no constitutions, in a\r\nfree government, can be unalterable. The present generation have indeed\r\na right to declare what _they_ deem a _privilege_; but they have no\r\nright to say what the _next_ generation shall deem a privilege. A state\r\nis a supreme corporate body that never dies. Its powers, when it acts\r\nfor itself, are at all times equally extensiv; and it has the same right\r\nto _repeal_ a law this year, as it had to _make_ it the last. If\r\ntherefore our posterity are bound by our constitutions, and can neither\r\namend nor annul them, they are to all intents and purposes our slaves.\r\n\r\nBut it will be enquired, have we then no right to say, that trial by\r\njury, the liberty of the press, the habeas corpus writ, and other\r\ninvaluable privileges, shall never be infringed nor destroyed? By no\r\nmeans. We have the same right to say that lands shall descend in a\r\nparticular mode to the heirs of the deceased proprietor, and that such a\r\nmode shall never be altered by future generations, as we have to pass a\r\nlaw that the trial by jury shall never be abridged. The right of Jury\r\ntrial, which we deem invaluable, may in future cease to be a privilege;\r\nor other modes of trial more satisfactory to the people, may be devised.\r\nSuch an event is neither impossible nor improbable. Have we then a right\r\nto say that our posterity shall not be judges of their own\r\ncircumstances? The very attempt to make _perpetual_ constitutions, is\r\nthe assumption of a right to control the opinions of future generations;\r\nand to legislate for those over whom we have as little authority as we\r\nhave over a nation in Asia. Nay we have as little right to say that\r\ntrial by jury shall be perpetual, as the English, in the reign of Edward\r\nthe Confessor, had, to bind their posterity forever to decide causes by\r\nfiery Ordeal, or single combat. There are perhaps many laws and\r\nregulations, which from their consonance to the eternal rules of\r\njustice, will always be good and conformable to the sense of a nation.\r\nBut most institutions in society, by reason of an unceasing change of\r\ncircumstances, either become altogether improper, or require amendment;\r\nand every nation has at all times, the right of judging of its\r\ncircumstances and determining on the propriety of changing its laws.\r\n\r\nThe English writers talk much of the omnipotence of Parliament; and yet\r\nthey seem to entertain some scruples about their right to change\r\nparticular parts of their constitution. I question much whether\r\nParliament would not hesitate to change, on any occasion, an article of\r\nMagna Charta. Mr. Pitt, a few years ago, attempted to reform the mode of\r\nrepresentation in Parliament. Immediately an uproar was raised against\r\nthe measure, as _unconstitutional_. The representation of the kingdom,\r\nwhen first established, was doubtless equal and wise; but by the\r\nincrease of some cities and boroughs, and the depopulation of others, it\r\nhas become extremely _unequal_. In some boroughs there is scarcely an\r\nelector left to enjoy its privileges. If the nation feels no great\r\ninconvenience from this change of circumstances, under the old mode of\r\nrepresentation, a reform is unnecessary. But if such a change has\r\nproduced any national evils of magnitude enough to be felt, the present\r\nform of electing the Representativs of the nation, however\r\n_constitutional_, and venerable for its antiquity, may at any time be\r\namended, if it should be the sense of Parliament. The _expediency_ of\r\nthe alteration must always be a matter of opinion; but all scruples as\r\nto the right of making it are totally groundless.\r\n\r\nMagna Charta may be considered as a contract between two parties, the\r\nKing and the Barons, and no contract can be altered but by the consent\r\nof both parties. But whenever any article of that deed or contract shall\r\nbecome inconvenient or oppressiv, the King, Lords and Commons may either\r\namend or annul it at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe same reasoning applies to each of the United States, and to the\r\nFederal Republic in general. But an important question will arise from\r\nthe foregoing remarks, which must be the subject of another paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. IV.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, 1788.\r\n\r\nON GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important question I proposed to discuss in this number, is this:\r\n\"Whether, in a free State, there ought to be any distinction between the\r\npowers of the people, or electors, and the powers of the Representativs\r\nin the Legislature.\" Or in other words, \"whether the legislativ body is\r\nnot, or ought not to be, a standing convention, invested with the whole\r\npower of their constituents.\"\r\n\r\nIn supporting the affirmativ of this question, I must face the opinions\r\nand prejudices of my countrymen; yet if we attend closely to the merits\r\nof the question, stripped of all its specious covering, we shall perhaps\r\nfind more arguments in favor of the opinion, than we at first suspect.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a Legislature must be the supreme power, whose\r\ndecisions are laws binding upon the whole State. Unless the Legislature\r\nis the supreme power, and invested with _all_ the authority of the\r\nState, its acts are not laws, obligatory upon the whole State.[18] I am\r\nsensible that it is a favorite idea in this country, bandied about from\r\none demagogue to another, that _rulers are the servants of the people_.\r\nSo far as their business is _laborious_ and _embarrassing_, it implies a\r\ndegree of servitude; but in any other view, the opinion is totally\r\nfalse. The people ought at least to place their rulers, who are\r\ngenerally men of the first abilities and integrity, on a level with\r\nthemselves; for that is an odd kind of government indeed, in which,\r\n_servants_ govern their _masters_. The truth is, a Representativ, as an\r\nindividual, is on a footing with other people; as a Representativ of a\r\nState, he is invested with a share of the sovereign authority, and is so\r\nfar a _governor_ of the people. In short, the collectiv body of the\r\nRepresentativs, is the collectiv sense and authority of the people; and\r\nso far are the members from being the _servants_ of the people, that\r\nthey are just as much _masters_, _rulers_, _governors_, whatever\r\nappellation we give them, as the people would be themselves in a\r\nconvention of the whole State.\r\n\r\n    [18] The first convention of deputies in a state, is usually\r\n    designed to direct the mode in which future legislatures\r\n    shall be organized. This convention cannot abridge the powers\r\n    of future legislatures, any further than they are abridged by\r\n    the moral law, which forbids all wrong in general.\r\n\r\nBut in the second place, the public good or safety requires that the\r\npowers of a Legislature should be coextensiv with those of the people.\r\nThat a Legislature should be competent to pass any law that the public\r\nsafety and interest may require, is a position that no man will\r\ncontrovert. If therefore it can be proved that the reservation of any\r\npower in the hands of the people, may at times interfere with the power\r\nof the Legislature to consult the public interest, and prevent its\r\nexercise, it must be acknowleged, that such a reservation is not only\r\nimpolitic, but unjust. That a Legislature should have unlimited power to\r\ndo _right_, is unquestionable; but such a power they cannot have, unless\r\nthey have all the power of the State; which implies an unlimited power\r\nto do _wrong_. For instance, suppose the constitution of any state to\r\ndeclare, that no standing army shall be kept up in time of peace; then\r\nthe Legislature cannot raise and maintain a single soldier to guard our\r\nfrontiers, without violating the constitution. To say that new\r\nenlistments every year will save the constitution, is idle; for if a\r\nbody of troops raised for thirty years is a standing army, then a body\r\nraised for twenty years, or for six months, is a standing army; and the\r\npower to raise troops for a year, is a power to raise them at any time\r\nand maintain them forever; but with the addition of much trouble and a\r\nload of expense. Since therefore there never was, and probably never\r\nwill be a time, till the millenium shall arrive, when troops will not be\r\nnecessary to guard the frontiers of States, a clause in a constitution,\r\nrestricting a Legislature from maintaining troops in time of peace,\r\nwill unavoidably disable them from guarding the public interest. That a\r\npower to raise and equip troops at pleasure, may be abused, is certain;\r\nbut that the public safety cannot be established without that power, is\r\nequally certain. The liberty of a people does not rest on any\r\nreservation of power in their hands paramount to their Legislature; it\r\nrests singly on this principle, _a union of interests between the\r\ngovernors and governed_. While a Legislator himself, his family and his\r\nproperty, are all liable to the consequences of the laws which he makes\r\nfor the State, the rights of the people are as safe from the invasion of\r\npower, as they can be on this side heaven. This union of interest\r\ndepends partly on the laws of property; but mostly on the _freedom of\r\nelection_. The right of electing rulers is the people's prerogativ; and\r\nwhile this remains unabridged, it is a sufficient barrier to guard all\r\ntheir other rights. This prerogativ should be kept sacred; and if the\r\npeople ever suffer any abridgment of this privilege, it must be their\r\nown folly and an irrecoverable loss.\r\n\r\nStill further, I maintain that a people have no right to say, that any\r\ncivil or political regulation shall be perpetual, because they have no\r\nright to make laws for those who are not in existence. This will be\r\nadmitted; but still the people contend that they have a right to\r\nprescribe rules for their Legislature, rules which shall not be changed\r\nbut by the people in a convention. But what is a convention? Why a body\r\nof men chosen by the people in the manner they choose the members of the\r\nLegislature, and commonly composed of the same men; but at any rate they\r\nare neither wiser nor better. The sense of the people is no better known\r\nin a convention, than in the Legislature.[19]\r\n\r\n    [19] The _nominal_ distinction of _Convention_ and\r\n    _Legislature_ was probably copied from the English; but the\r\n    American distinction goes farther, it implies, in common\r\n    acceptation, a difference of _power_. This difference does\r\n    not exist in G. Britain. The assembly of Lords and Commons\r\n    which restored Charles II, and that which raised the Prince\r\n    of Orange to the throne, were called _Conventions_, or\r\n    _parliamentary Conventions_. But the difference between these\r\n    Conventions and an ordinary Parliament, is merely a\r\n    difference in the manner of assembling; a _Convention_ being\r\n    an assembly or meeting of Lords and Commons, on an emergency,\r\n    without the King's writ, which is the regular constitutional\r\n    mode of summoning them, and by custom necessary to render the\r\n    meeting a _Parliament_. But the powers of this assembly,\r\n    whether denominated a _Convention_ or a _Parliament_, have\r\n    ever been considered as coextensive and supreme. I would just\r\n    remark further, that the impossibility of establishing\r\n    perpetual, or even permanent forms of government, is proved\r\n    already by the experience of two States in America.\r\n    Pensylvania and Georgia, have suffered under bad\r\n    Constitutions, till they are glad to go thro the process of\r\n    calling a new Convention. After the new forms of government\r\n    have been tried some time, the people will discover new\r\n    defects, and must either call a third Convention, or let the\r\n    governments go on without amendment, because their\r\n    Legislatures, which ought to have supreme power, cannot make\r\n    altertations.---- [1789.]\r\n\r\nBut admit the right of establishing certain rules or principles which an\r\nordinary Legislature cannot change, and what is the consequence? It is\r\nthis, a change of circumstances must supersede the propriety of such\r\nrules, or render alterations necessary to the safety or freedom of the\r\nState; yet there is no power existing, but in the people at large, to\r\nmake the necessary alterations. A convention then must be called to\r\ntransact a business, which an ordinary Legislature can transact just as\r\nwell; a convention differing from the Legislature merely in name, and in\r\na few formalities of their proceedings. But when people have enjoyed a\r\ntolerable share of happiness under a government, they will not readily\r\nstep out of the common road of proceeding; and evils insensibly increase\r\nto an enormous degree, before the people can be persuaded to a change.\r\nThe reservation therefore of certain powers may, by an imperceptible\r\nchange of circumstances, prove highly pernicious to a State. For\r\nexample: When the Commons of England were first admitted to a share in\r\nthe legislation of that kingdom, which was probably in the reign of\r\nHenry III, in 1265,[20] the representation was tolerably equal. But the\r\nchanges in the population of different parts of the kingdom have\r\ndestroyed all equality. The mode of election therefore should be\r\nreformed. But how shall it be done? If there is a constitution in that\r\nkingdom, which settles the mode of election, and that constitution is an\r\nact of the people, paramount to the power of the Parliament, and\r\nunchangeable by them, a convention of the people must be called to make\r\nan alteration which would be as well made in Parliament. This would\r\noccasion infinite trouble and expense.\r\n\r\n    [20] This is the date of the first writs now extant, for\r\n    summoning the Knights and Burgesses.\r\n\r\nBut the danger is, that as an evil of this kind increases, so will the\r\nlethargy of the people, and their habits of vice and negligence. Thus\r\nthe disease acquires force, for want of an early remedy, and a\r\ndissolution ensues. But a Legislature, which is always watching the\r\npublic safety, will more early discover the approaches of disorders, and\r\nmore speedily apply a remedy. This is not precisely the case with the\r\nBritish constitution; for it was not committed at once to parchment and\r\nratified by the people. It consists rather of practice, or common law,\r\nwith some statutes of Parliament. But the English have been too jealous\r\nof changing their practice, even for the better. All the writers on the\r\nEnglish constitution agree, that any Parliament can change or amend\r\nevery part of it; yet in practice, the idea of an _unalterable\r\nconstitution_ has had too much influence in preventing a reform in their\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nBut we have an example nearer home directly in point. The charter of\r\nConnecticut declares that each town shall have liberty to send _one_ or\r\n_two_ deputies to the General Court; and the constant practice has been\r\nto send _two_. While the towns were few, the number of Representativs\r\nwas not inconvenient; but since the complete settlement of the State,\r\nand the multiplication of the towns, the number has swelled the\r\nLegislature to an unwieldly and expensive size. The house of\r\nRepresentativs consists of about 170 members: An attempt has been made,\r\nat several sessions, to lessen the representation, by limiting each town\r\nto one Deputy. A question arises, have the Assembly a right to lessen\r\nthe representation? In most States, it would be decided in the negativ.\r\nYet in that State it is no question at all; for there is a standing law\r\nexpressly delegating the _whole_ power of all the freemen to the\r\nLegislature. But I bring this instance to prove the possibility of\r\nchanges in any system of government, which will require material\r\nalterations in its fundamental principles; and the Legislature should\r\nalways be competent to make the necessary amendments, or they have not\r\nan unlimited power to do right.[21]\r\n\r\n    [21] In Pensylvania, after the late choice of Delegates to\r\n    Congress by the people, one of the Gentlemen sent his\r\n    resignation to the President and Council, who refered it to\r\n    the Legislature then sitting. This body, compozed of the\r\n    servants of the people, I suppoze, solemnly resolved, that\r\n    there was no power in the State which could accept the\r\n    resignation. The resolv was grounded on the idea that the\r\n    power of the people is paramount to that of the Legislature;\r\n    whereas the people hav no power at all, except in choosing\r\n    representativs. All Legislativ and Executiv powers are vested\r\n    in their Representativs, in Councilor Assembly, and the\r\n    Council should have accepted the resignation and issued a\r\n    precept for another choice. Their compelling the man to serve\r\n    was an act of tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between the _Legislature_ and a _Convention_ is, for the\r\nfirst time, introduced into Connecticut, by the recommendation of the\r\nlate convention of States, in order to adopt the new constitution. The\r\nLegislature of the State, without adverting to laws or practice,\r\nimmediately recommended a convention for that purpose. Yet a distinction\r\nbetween a _Convention_ and a _Legislature_ is, in that State, a palpable\r\nabsurdity, even by their own laws; for there is no constitution in the\r\nState, except its laws, which are always repealable by an ordinary\r\nLegislature; and the laws and uniform practice, from the first\r\norganization of the government, declare that _the Legislature has all\r\nthe power of all the people_. A convention therefore can have no more\r\npower, and differs no more from an ordinary Legislature, than one\r\nLegislature does from another. Or rather it is no more than a\r\nLegislature chosen for _one particular purpose_ of supremacy; whereas an\r\nordinary Legislature is competent to _all_ purposes of supremacy. But\r\nhad the Legislature of that State ratified or rejected the new\r\nconstitution, without consulting their constituents, their act would\r\nhave been valid and binding. This is the excellence of the constitution\r\nof Connecticut, that the _Legislature_ is considered as the _body of the\r\npeople_; and the people have not been taught to make a distinction which\r\nshould never exist, and consider themselves as _masters_ of their\r\n_rulers_, and their power as paramount to the laws. To this excellence\r\nin her frame of government, that State is indebted for uniformity and\r\nstability in public measures, during a period of one hundred and fifty\r\nyears; a period of unparalleled tranquillity, never once disturbed by a\r\nviolent obstruction of justice, or any popular commotion or rebellion.\r\nWretched indeed would be the people of that State, should they adopt the\r\nvulgar maxim, that their rulers are their _servants_. We then may expect\r\nthat the _laws_ of those _servants_ will be treated with the same\r\ncontempt, as they are in some other States.[22]\r\n\r\n    [22] This pernicious error subverts the whole foundation of\r\n    government. It resembles the practice of some Gentlemen in\r\n    the country, who hire a poor strolling vagabond to keep a\r\n    school, and then let the children know that he is a mere\r\n    _servant_. The consequence is, the children despise him and\r\n    his rules, and a constant war is maintained between the\r\n    master and his pupils. The boys think themselves more\r\n    respectable than the master, and the master has the rod in\r\n    his hand, which he never fails to exercise. A proper degree\r\n    of respect for the man and his laws, would prevent a thousand\r\n    hard knocks. This is _government in miniature_. Men are\r\n    taught to believe that their rulers are their _servants_, and\r\n    then are rewarded with a prison and a gallows for despising\r\n    their laws.\r\n\r\nBut from the manner in which government is constituted, it is evident\r\nthat there is no power residing in the State at large, which does not\r\nreside in the legislature. I know it is said that government originates\r\nin _compact_; but I am very confident, that if this is true, the\r\n_compact_ is different from any other kind of compact that is known\r\namong men. In all other _compacts_, _agreements_ or _covenants_, the\r\nassent of every person concerned, or who is to be bound by the compact,\r\nis requisite to render it valid and obligatory upon such person. But I\r\nvery much question whether this ever takes place in any constitution of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps so far there is an _implied compact_ in government, that every\r\nman consents to be bound by the opinion of a majority; but this is all a\r\n_supposition_; for the consent of a hundredth part of a society is never\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, government originates in _necessity_ and _utility_; and\r\nwhether there is an implied compact or not, the opinions of the _few_\r\nmust be overruled, and submit to the opinions of the _many_. But the\r\nopinions of a majority cannot be known, but in an Assembly of the whole\r\nsociety; and no _part_ of the society has a right to decide upon a\r\nmeasure which equally affects the _whole_, without a consultation with\r\nthe whole, to hear their arguments and objections. It is said that _all_\r\npower resides in the _people_; but it must be remembered, that let the\r\nsupreme power be where it will, it can be exercised only in an _Assembly\r\nof the whole State_, or in an _Assembly of the Representativs of the\r\nwhole State_.\r\n\r\nSuppose the power to reside in the people, yet they cannot, and they\r\nhave no right to exercise it in their scattered districts, and the\r\nreason is very obvious; it is impossible that the propriety of a measure\r\ncan be ascertained, without the best general information, and a full\r\nknowlege of the opinions of the men on whom it is to operate.\r\n\r\nBy opinions here I would not be understood to mean, the various opinions\r\nformed on a view of a particular interest, for these opinions may be\r\nobtained by sending to each district, and collecting instructions; but I\r\nmean the _opinions_ of the _whole society_, formed on the _information_\r\nand _debates_ of the _whole society_. These opinions can be formed no\r\nwhere but in a Convention of the _whole State_, or of their\r\n_Representativs_. So far therefore are the people from having a power\r\nparamount to that of their Representativs in Convention, that they can\r\nexercise no act of supremacy or legislation at all, but in a Convention\r\nof the whole State by Representativs.[23] Unless therefore, it can be\r\nproved that a _Convention_, so called, which is composed mostly of the\r\nsame men as a Legislature, possesses some wisdom, power or\r\nqualifications, which a Legislature _does not_ and _cannot_, then the\r\ndistinction is useless and trifling. A Legislature is supposed to\r\nconsist of men whom the people judge best qualified to superintend their\r\ninterests; a convention cannot be composed of better men; and in fact we\r\nfind it generally composed of the _same men_. If therefore no act of\r\nsovereignty can be exercised but in an Assembly of Representativs, of\r\nwhat consequence is it, whether we call it a _Convention_ or a\r\n_Legislature_? or why is not the Assembly of Representativs of a people,\r\nat all times a _Convention_, as well as a _Legislature_?\r\n\r\n    [23] \"In a democracy there can be no exercise of sovereignty\r\n    but by suffrage: In England, where the people do not debate\r\n    in a collective body, but by representation, the exercise of\r\n    this sovereignty consists in the _choice of\r\n    Representatives_.\" _Blackstone's Com. b. 1. ch. 2._ This is\r\n    the sole power of the people in America.\r\n\r\nTo me it appears that a distinction is made without a difference; but a\r\ndistinction that will often prevent good measures, perpetuate evils in\r\ngovernment, and by creating a pretended power paramount to the\r\nLegislature, tend to bring laws into contempt.\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.---- This reasoning applies solely to the individual States,\r\nand not to the United States, before they were formed into a federal\r\nbody. An important distinction must be observed between the\r\n_Constitution of a sovereign State_, and of _thirteen distinct\r\nsovereignties_. In a sovereign State, whatever they may suggest to the\r\ncontrary, the voices of a majority are binding upon the minority, even\r\nin framing the first plan of government. In general, a majority of the\r\nvotes of the _Representativs_ in Legislature or Convention have been\r\nadmitted as obligatory upon every member of the State, in forming and\r\nestablishing a Constitution: But when the Constitution has been\r\nsubmitted to the people, as it is called, in town meetings or other\r\nsmall assemblies, the assent of every individual could not be expressly\r\nobtained; and the dissent of any number, less than half the freemen\r\npresent, who might not be one half the whole number in the State, could\r\nnot prevent the establishment of the government, nor invalidate the\r\nobligation of _every man_ to submit peaceably to its operation. The\r\nmembers of a state or community, cannot _from necessity_, be considered\r\nas parties to a contract, where the assent of every man is necessary to\r\nbind him to a performance of the engagement. But the several States,\r\nenter into a negociation like _contracting parties_; they agree that the\r\nassent of every individual State, shall be requisite to bind that State;\r\nand the frame of government, so agreed upon, is considered as a compact\r\nbetween independent sovereignties, which derives its binding force from\r\nthe mutual and unanimous consent of the parties, and not merely from a\r\nnecessity that the major part of the people should compel the rest to\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\nBut in this very compact, the States have resigned their independent\r\nsovereignty, and become a single body or state, as to certain purposes;\r\nfor they have solemnly contracted with each other, that _three fourths\r\nof_ their number may alter and amend the first compact. They are\r\ntherefore no longer separate individuals and contracting parties; but\r\nthey form a single State or body politic; and a majority of three\r\nfourths can exert every act of sovereignty, except in two or three\r\nparticulars, expressly reserved in the compact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. V.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, 1788.\r\n\r\nON GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Virginia, like that of Connecticut, stands on the\r\ntrue principles of a Republican Representativ Government. It is not\r\nshackled with a Bill of Rights, and every part of it, is at any time,\r\nalterable by an ordinary Legislature. When I say _every part_ of the\r\nconstitution is alterable, I would except the right of elections, for\r\nthe Representativs have not power to prolong the period of their own\r\ndelegation. This is not numbered among the rights of legislation, and\r\ndeserves a separate consideration. This right is not vested in the\r\nLegislature; it is in the people at large; it cannot be alienated\r\nwithout changing the form of government. Nay the right of election is\r\nnot only the _basis_, but the _whole frame_ or essence of a republican\r\nconstitution; it is not merely _one_, but it is the _only_ legislativ or\r\nconstitutional act, which the people at large can with propriety\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nThe simple principle for which I contend is this, \"That in a\r\nrepresentativ democracy, the delegates chosen for Legislators ought, at\r\nall times, to be competent to every possible act of legislation _under\r\nthat form of government_; but not to _change that form_.\" Besides it is\r\ncontrary to all our ideas of _deputation_ or _agency for others_, that\r\nthe person acting should have the power of extending the period of\r\nagency beyond the time specified in his commission. The Representativ of\r\na people is, as to his powers, in the situation of an Attorney, whose\r\nletters commission him to do every thing which his constituent would do,\r\nwhere he on the spot; but for a limited time only. At the expiration of\r\nthat time his powers cease; and a Representativ has no more right to\r\nextend that period, than a plenipotentiary has to renew his commission.\r\nThe British Parliament, by prolonging the period of their existence\r\nfrom one to three, and from three to seven years, committed an unjust\r\nact; an act however which has been confirmed by the acquiescence of the\r\nnation, and thus received the highest constitutional sanction. I am\r\nsensible that the Americans are much concerned for the liberties of the\r\nBritish nation; and the act for making Parliaments septennial is often\r\nmentioned as an arbitrary, oppressiv act, destructiv of English\r\nliberty.[24] The English are doubtless obliged to us for our tender\r\nconcern for their happiness; yet for myself I entertain no such ideas:\r\nThe English have generally understood and advocated their rights as well\r\nas any nation, and I am confident that the nation enjoys as much\r\nhappiness and freedom, and much more tranquillity, under septennial\r\nParliaments, than they would with annual elections. Corruption to obtain\r\noffices will ever attend wealth; it is generated with it, grows up with\r\nit, and will always fill a country with violent factions and illegal\r\npractices. Such are the habits of the people, that money will have a\r\nprincipal influence in carrying elections; and such vast sums are\r\nnecessary for the purpose, that if elections were annual, none but a few\r\nof the wealthiest men could defray the expense; the landholders of\r\nmoderate estates would not offer themselves as candidates; and thus in\r\nfact annual elections, with the present habits of the people, would\r\nactually diminish the influence of the Commons, by throwing the\r\nadvantage into the hands of a corrupt ministry, and a few overgrown\r\nnabobs. Before annual elections would be a blessing to the English,\r\ntheir habits must be changed; but this cannot be effected by human\r\nforce. I wish my countrymen would believe that other nations understand\r\nand can guard their privileges, without any lamentable outcries from\r\nthis side of the Atlantic. Government will always take its complexion\r\nfrom the habits of the people; habits are continually changing from age\r\nto age; a body of Legislators taken from the people, will generally\r\nrepresent these habits at the time when they are chosen: Hence these\r\ntwo important conclusions, 1st, That a legislativ body should be\r\nfrequently renewed and always taken from the people: 2d, That a\r\ngovernment which is perpetual, or incapable of being accommodated to\r\nevery change of national habits, must in time become a _bad_ government.\r\n\r\n    [24] The septennial act was judged the only guard against a\r\n    Popish reign, and therefore highly popular.\r\n\r\nWith this view of the subject, I cannot suppress my surprise at the\r\nreasoning of Mr. Jefferson on this very point.[25] He considers it as a\r\ndefect in the constitution of Virginia, that _it can be altered by an\r\nordinary Legislature_. He observes that the Convention which framed the\r\npresent constitution of that State, \"received no powers in their\r\ncreation which were not given to every Legislature before and since. So\r\nfar and no farther authorised, they organized the government by the\r\nordinance entitled a Constitution or form of government. It pretends to\r\nno higher authority than the other ordinances of the same session; it\r\ndoes not say, that it shall be perpetual; that it shall be unalterable\r\nby other Legislatures; that it shall be transcendant above the powers of\r\nthose, who they knew would have equal powers with themselves.\"\r\n\r\n    [25] Notes on Virginia, page 197. Lond. Edit. Query 13.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the framers of this ordinance had said, that it should be\r\n_perpetual_ and _unalterable_; such a declaration would have been void.\r\nNay, altho the people themselves had individually and unanimously\r\ndeclared the ordinance perpetual, the declaration would have been\r\ninvalid. One Assembly cannot pass an act, binding upon a subsequent\r\nAssembly of equal authority;[26] and the people in 1776, had no\r\nauthority, and consequently could delegate none, to pass a single act\r\nwhich the people in 1777, could not repeal and annul. And Mr. Jefferson\r\nhimself, in the very next sentence, assigns a reason, which is an\r\nunanswerable argument in favor of my position, and a complete refutation\r\nof his own. These are his words. \"Not only the silence of the instrument\r\nis a proof they thought it would be alterable, but their own practice\r\nalso: For this very Convention, meeting as a House of Delegates in\r\nGeneral Assembly with the new Senate in the autumn of that year, passed\r\nacts of Assembly in contradiction to their ordinance of government; and\r\n_every Assembly from that time to this, has done the same_.\"\r\n\r\n    [26] Contracts, where a Legislature is a party, are excepted.\r\n\r\nDid Mr. Jefferson reflect upon the inference that would be justly drawn\r\nfrom these facts? Did he not consider that he was furnishing his\r\nopponents with the most effectual weapons against himself? The acts\r\npassed by _every subsequent Assembly in contradiction to the first\r\nordinance_, prove that all the Assemblies were _fallible_ men; and\r\nconsequently not competent to make _perpetual Constitutions_ for future\r\ngenerations. To give Mr. Jefferson, and the other advocates for\r\n_unchangeable Constitutions_, the fullest latitude in their argument, I\r\nwill suppose every freeman of Virginia, could have been assembled to\r\ndeliberate upon a form of government, and that the present form, or even\r\none more perfect, had been the result of their Councils; and that they\r\nhad declared it unalterable. What would have been the consequence?\r\nExperience would probably have discovered, what is the fact; and what\r\nforever will be the case; that _Conventions_ are not possessed of\r\n_infinite wisdom_; that the wisest men cannot devise a perfect system of\r\ngovernment. After all this solemn national transaction, and a formal\r\ndeclaration that their proceedings should be unalterable, suppose a\r\nsingle article of the Constitution should be found to interfere with\r\nsome national benefit, some material advantage; where would be the power\r\nto change or reform that article? In the same general Assembly of all\r\nthe people, and in no other body. But must a State be put to this\r\ninconvenience, to find a remedy for every defect of constitution?\r\n\r\nSuppose, however, the _Convention_ had been empowered to declare the\r\nform of government _unalterable_: What would have been the consequence?\r\nMr. Jefferson himself has related the consequence. Every succeeding\r\nAssembly has found errors or defects in that frame of government, and\r\nhas happily applied a remedy. But had not every Legislature had power\r\nto make these alterations, Virginia must have gone thro the farce, and\r\nthe trouble of calling an _extraordinary_ Legislature, to do that which\r\nan _ordinary_ Legislature could do just as well, in their annual\r\nsession; or those errors must have remained in the constitution, to the\r\ninjury of the State.\r\n\r\nThe whole argument for Bills of Rights and unalterable Constitutions\r\nrests on two suppositions, viz. that the Convention which frames the\r\ngovernment, is _infallible_; and that future Legislatures will be _less\r\nhonest_, _less wise_, and _less attentiv to the interest of the State_,\r\nthan a present Convention: The first supposition is _always false_, and\r\nthe last is _generally_ so. A declaration of perpetuity, annexed to a\r\nform of government, implies a supposition of _perfect wisdom and\r\nprobity_ in the framers; which is both arrogant and impudent; and it\r\nimplies a supposed power in them, to abridge the power of a succeeding\r\nConvention, and of the future state or body of people. The last\r\nsupposition is, in every possible instance of legislation, _false_; and\r\nan attempt to exercise such a power, a high handed act of tyranny. But\r\nsetting aside the argument, grounded on a want of power in one Assembly\r\nto abridge the power of another, what occasion have we to be so jealous\r\nof future Legislatures? Why should we be so anxious to guard the future\r\nrights of a nation? Why should we not distrust the people and the\r\nRepresentativs of the present age, as well as those of future ages, in\r\nwhose acts we have not the smallest interest? For my part, I believe\r\nthat the peeple and their Representativs, two or three centuries hence,\r\nwill be as honest, as wise, as faithful to themselves, and will\r\nunderstand their rights as well, and be as able to defend them, as the\r\npeople are at this period. The contrary supposition is absurd.\r\n\r\nI know it is said, that other nations have lost their liberties by the\r\nambitious designs of their rulers, and we may do the same. The\r\nexperience of other nations, furnishes the ground of all the arguments\r\nused in favor of an unalterable constitution. The advocates seem\r\ndetermined that posterity shall not lose their liberty, even if they\r\nshould be willing and desirous to surrender it. If a few declarations on\r\nparchment, will secure a single blessing to posterity, which they would\r\notherwise lose, I resign the argument, and will receive a thousand\r\ndeclarations. Yet so thoroughly convinced am I of the opposite tendency\r\nand effect of such unalterable declarations, that, were it possible to\r\nrender them valid, I should deem every article an infringement of civil\r\nand political liberty. I should consider every article as a restriction\r\nwhich might impose some duty which in time might cease to be useful and\r\nnecessary, while the obligation of performing it might remain; or which\r\nin its operation might prove pernicious, by producing effects which were\r\nnot expected, and could not be foreseen. There is no one single right,\r\nno privilege, which is commonly deemed fundamental, which may not, by an\r\nunalterable establishment, preclude some amendment, some improvement in\r\nfuture administration of government. And unless the advocates for\r\nunalterable constitutions of government, can prevent all changes in the\r\nwants, the inclinations, the habits, and the circumstances of people,\r\nthey will find it difficult, even with all their declarations of\r\nunalterable rights, to prevent changes in government. A paper\r\ndeclaration is a very feeble barrier against the force of national\r\nhabits, and inclinations.\r\n\r\nThe loss of liberty, as it is called, in the kingdoms of Europe, has, in\r\nseveral instances, been a mere change of government, effected by a\r\nchange of habits, and in some instances this change has been favorable\r\nto liberty. The government of Denmark, was changed from a mixed form,\r\nlike that of England, to an absolute monarchy, by a solemn deliberate\r\nact of the people or States. Was this a loss of liberty? So far from it,\r\nthat the change removed the oppressions of faction, restored liberty to\r\nthe subject and tranquillity to the kingdom. The change was a blessing\r\nto the people. It indeed lodged a power in the Prince to dispose of life\r\nand property; but at the same time it lodged in him a _power to defend\r\nboth_; a power which before was lodged _no where_; and it is infinitely\r\nbetter that such a power should be vested in a _single hand_, than that\r\nit should _not exist at all_. The monarchy of France has grown out of a\r\nnumber of petty states and lordships; yet it is a fact, proved by\r\nhistory and experience, that the subjects of that kingdom have acquired\r\nliberty, peace and happiness, in proportion to the diminution of the\r\npowers of the petty sovereignties, and the extension of the prerogativs\r\nof the Monarch. It is said that Spain lost her liberties under the reign\r\nof Charles Vth; but I question the truth of the assertion; it is\r\nprobable that the subject has gained as much by an abridgement of the\r\npowers of the nobility, as he lost by an annihilation of the Cortez. The\r\nUnited Netherlands fought with more bravery and perseverance to preserve\r\ntheir rights, than any other people since the days of Leonidas; and yet\r\nno sooner established a government, so jealously guarded as to defeat\r\nits own designs, and prevent the good effects of government, than they\r\nneglected its principles; the freemen resigned the privilege of\r\nelection, and committed their liberties to a rich aristocracy. There was\r\nno compulsion, no external force in producing this revolution; but the\r\nform of government, which had been established on paper, and solemnly\r\nratified, was not suited to the genius of the subjects. The burghers had\r\nthe right of electing their rulers; but they neglected it voluntarily;\r\nand a _bill of rights_, a _perpetual constitution_ on parchment,\r\nguaranteeing that right, was a useless form of words, because opposed to\r\nthe temper of the people. The government assumed a complexion, more\r\ncorrespondent to their habits, and tho in theory no constitution is more\r\ncautiously guarded against an infringement of popular privileges, yet in\r\npractice it is a real aristocracy.\r\n\r\nThe progress of government in England has been the reverse: The people\r\nhave been gaining freedom by intrenching upon the powers of the nobles\r\nand the royal prerogativs. These changes in government do not proceed\r\nfrom _bills of rights_, _unalterable forms_ and _perpetual\r\nestablishments_; liberty is never secured by such paper declarations,\r\nnor lost for want of them. The truth is, Government originates in\r\nnecessity, and takes its form and structure from the genius and habits\r\nof the people; and if on paper a form is not accommodated to those\r\nhabits, it will assume a new form, in spite of all the formal sanctions\r\nof the supreme authority of a State. Were the monarchy of France to be\r\ndissolved, and the wisest system of republican government ever invented,\r\nsolemnly declared, by the King and his council, to be the constitution\r\nof the kingdom; the people with their present habits, would refuse to\r\nreceive it; and resign their privileges to their beloved sovereign. But\r\nso opposite are the habits of the Americans, that an attempt to erect a\r\nmonarchy or an aristocracy over the United States, would expose the\r\nauthors to the loss of their heads.[27] The truth is, the people of\r\nEurope, since they have become civilized, have, in no kingdom, possessed\r\n_all_ the true principles of liberty. They could not therefore lose what\r\nthey never possessed. There have been, from time immemorial, some rights\r\nof government, some prerogativs vested in some man or body of men,\r\nindependent of the suffrages of the body of the subjects. This\r\ncircumstance distinguishes the governments of Europe and of all the\r\nworld, from those of America. There has been in the free nations of\r\nEurope an incessant struggle between freedom or national rights, and\r\nhereditary prerogativs. The contest has ended variously in different\r\nkingdoms; but generally in depressing the power of the nobility;\r\nascertaining and limiting the prerogativs of the crown, and extending\r\nthe privileges of the people. The Americans have seen the records of\r\ntheir struggles; and without considering that the objects of the contest\r\n_do not exist in this country_; they are laboring to guard rights which\r\nthere is no party to attack. They are as jealous of their rights, as if\r\nthere existed here a King's prerogativs, or the powers of nobles,\r\nindependent of their own will and choice, and ever eager to swallow up\r\ntheir liberties. But there is _no man_ in America, who claims any rights\r\nbut what are common to _every man_; there is no man who has an interest\r\nin invading popular privileges, because his attempt to curtail another's\r\nrights, would expose his own to the same abridgement. The jealousy of\r\npeople in this country has no proper object against which it can\r\nrationally arm them; it is therefore directed _against themselves_, or\r\nagainst an invasion which they _imagine_ may happen in future ages. The\r\ncontest for _perpetual bills of rights_ against a future tyranny,\r\nresembles Don Quixote's fighting windmills; and I never can reflect on\r\nthe declamation about an _unalterable constitution_ to guard certain\r\nrights, without wishing to add another article, as necessary as those\r\nthat are generally mentioned, viz. \"that no future Convention or\r\nLegislature shall cut their own throats, or those of their\r\nconstituents.\" While the habits of the Americans remain as they are, the\r\npeople will choose their Legislature from their own body; that\r\nLegislature will have an interest inseparable from that of the people,\r\nand therefore an act to restrain their power in any article of\r\nlegislation, is as unnecessary as an act to prevent them from committing\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n    [27] Some jealous people ignorantly call the proposed\r\n    Constitution of Federal Government, an _aristocracy_. If such\r\n    men are honest, their honesty deserves pity: There is not a\r\n    feature of true aristocracy in the Constitution; the whole\r\n    frame of Government is a pure Representativ Republic.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson, in answer to those who maintain that the form of\r\ngovernment in Virginia is unalterable, because it is called a\r\n_constitution_, which, ex vi termini, means an act above the power of\r\nthe ordinary Legislature, asserts that _constitution_, _statute_, _law_\r\nand _ordinance_, are synonymous terms, and convertible as they are used\r\nby writers on government. Constitutio dicitur jus quod a principe\r\nconditur. Constitutum, quod ab imperatoribus rescriptum statutumve est.\r\nStatutum, idem quod lex.[28] Here the words _constitution_, _statute_\r\nand _law_, are defined by each other; they were used as convertible\r\nterms by all former writers, whether Roman or British; and before the\r\nterms of the civil law were introduced, our Saxon ancestors used the\r\ncorrespondent English words, _bid_ and _set_.[29] From hence he\r\nconcludes that no inference can be drawn from the meaning of the word,\r\nthat a _constitution_ has a higher authority than a law or statute. This\r\nconclusion of Mr. Jefferson is just.\r\n\r\n    [28] Calvini Lexicon Juridicum.\r\n\r\n    [29] See Laws of the Saxon Kings.\r\n\r\nHe quotes Lord Coke also to prove that any parliament can abridge,\r\nsuspend or qualify the acts of a preceding Parliament. It is a maxim in\r\ntheir laws, that \"Leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant.\" After\r\nhaving fully proved that _constitution_, _statute_, _law_ and\r\n_ordinance_, are words of similar import, and that the constitution of\r\nVirginia is at any time alterable by the ordinary Legislature, he\r\nproceeds to prove the danger to which the rights of the people are\r\nexposed, for want of an _unalterable form of government_. The first\r\nproof of this danger he mentions, is, the power which the Assembly\r\nexercises of determining its own quorum. The British Parliament fixes\r\nits own quorum: The former Assemblies of Virginia did the same. During\r\nthe war the Legislature determined that _forty_ members should be a\r\nquorum to proceed to business, altho not a fourth part of the whole\r\nhouse. The danger of delay, it was judged, would warrant the measure.\r\nThis precedent, our writer supposes, is subversive of the principles of\r\nthe government, and dangerous to liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is a dictate of natural law that a _majority should govern_; and the\r\nprinciple is universally received and established in all societies,\r\nwhere no other mode has been arbitrarily fixed. This natural right\r\ncannot be alienated _in perpetuum_; for altho a Legislature, or even the\r\nbody of the people, may resign the powers of government to forty, or to\r\nfour men, when they please, yet they may likewise resume them at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThe people may, if they please, create a dictator on an emergency in\r\nwar, but his creation would not _destroy_, but merely _suspend_ the\r\nnatural right of the _Lex majoris partis_. Thus forty members, a\r\nminority of the Legislature of Virginia, were empowered during a\r\ndangerous invasion, to legislate for the State; but any subsequent\r\nAssembly might have divested them of that power. During the operation of\r\nthe law, vesting them with this power, their acts were binding upon the\r\nState; because their power was derived from the general sense of the\r\nState; it was actually derived from a legal majority. But that majority\r\ncould, at any moment, resume the power and practice on their natural\r\nright.\r\n\r\nIt is a standing law of Connecticut, that forty men shall be a quorum of\r\nthe House of Representativs, which consists of about 170 members. This\r\nlaw, I am confident, never excited a murmur, or a suspicion that the\r\nliberties of the people were in danger; yet this law creates an\r\noligarchy; it is an infringement of natural right; it subjects the State\r\nto the possibility, and even the probability of being governed at times\r\nby a minority. The acquiescence of the State, in the existence of the\r\nlaw, gives validity, and even the sanction of a majority, to the acts of\r\nthat minority; but the majority may at any time resume their natural\r\nright, and make the assent of more than half of the members, necessary\r\nto give validity to their determinations.\r\n\r\nThe danger therefore arising from a power in the Assembly to determine\r\ntheir own quorum, is merely ideal, for no law can be perpetual; the\r\nauthority of a majority of the people, or of their Representativs, is\r\nalways competent to repeal any act that is found unjust or inconvenient.\r\nThe acquiescence however of the people of the States mentioned, and that\r\nin one of them for a long course of years, under an oligarchy; or their\r\nsubmission to the power of a minority, is an incontestible proof of what\r\nI have before observed, that _theories_ and _forms of government_ are\r\n_empty things_; that the spirit of a government springs immediately from\r\nthe temper of the people, and the exercise of it will generally take its\r\ntone from their feelings. It proves likewise that a _union of interests_\r\nbetween the rulers and the people, which union will always coexist with\r\nfree elections, is not only the _best_, but the _only_ security for\r\ntheir liberties which they can wish for and demand. The Government of\r\nConnecticut is a solid proof of these truths. The Assembly of that\r\nState, have always had power to abolish trial by jury, to restrain the\r\nliberty of the press, to suspend the habeas corpus act, to maintain a\r\nstanding army, in short to command every engine of despotism; yet by\r\nsome means or other, it happens that the rights of the people are not\r\ninvaded, and the subjects have generally been better satisfied with the\r\nlaws, than the people of any other State. The reason is, the Legislature\r\nis a part of the people, and has the _same interest_. If a law should\r\nprove bad, the Legislature can repeal it; but in the _unalterable_ bills\r\nof rights in some of the States, if an article should prove wrong and\r\noppressiv, an ordinary Legislature cannot repeal or amend it; and the\r\nState will hardly think of calling a special Convention for so trifling\r\na purpose. There are some articles, in several of the State\r\nConstitutions, which are glaring infractions of the first rights of\r\nfreemen; yet they affect not a majority of the community; and centuries\r\nmay elapse before the evil can be redressed, and a respectable class of\r\nmen restored to the enjoyment of their rights.[30]\r\n\r\n    [30] Such is the article, which excludes the clergy from a\r\n    right to hold civil offices. The people, might, with the same\r\n    propriety, have declared, that no merchants nor lawyers\r\n    should be eligible to civil offices. It is a common opinion\r\n    that the business of the clergy is wholly _spiritual_. Never\r\n    was a grosser error. A part of their business is to inform\r\n    the minds of people on all subjects, and correct their\r\n    morals; so that they have a direct influence on government.\r\n    At any rate they are subjects of law, and ought as freemen to\r\n    be eligible to a seat in the Legislature; provided the people\r\n    incline to choose them.\r\n\r\nTo prove the want of an _unalterable Constitution_ in Virginia, Mr.\r\nJefferson informs us that in 1776, during the distressed circumstances\r\nof the State, a proposition was made in the House of Delegates to create\r\na Dictator, invested with every power, legislativ, executiv and\r\njudicial, civil and military. In June, 1781, under a great calamity, the\r\nproposition was repeated, and was near being passed. By the warmth he\r\ndiscovers in reprobating this proposal, one must suppose that the\r\ncreation of a Dictator even for a few months, would have buried every\r\nremain of freedom. Yet he seems to allow that the step would have been\r\njustified, had there existed an _irresistible necessity_.\r\n\r\nAltho it is possible that a case may happen, in which the creation of a\r\nDictator might be the only resort to save life, liberty, property and\r\nthe State, as it happened in Rome more than once; yet I should dread his\r\npower as much as any man, were I not convinced that the same men that\r\nappointed him, could, in a moment, strip him of his tremendous\r\nauthority. A Dictator, with an army superior to the strength of the\r\nState, would be a despot; but Mr. Jefferson's fears seem grounded on the\r\nauthority derived from the Legislature. A concession of power from the\r\nLegislature, or the people, is a voluntary suspension of a natural\r\n_unalienable_ right; and is resumeable at the expiration of the period\r\nspecified, or the moment it is abused. A State can never alienate a\r\n_natural right_; for it cannot legislate for those who are not in\r\nexistence. It may consent to suspend that right for great and temporary\r\npurposes; but were every freeman in Virginia to assent to the creation\r\nof a _perpetual Dictator_, the act in itself would be void. The\r\nexpedient of creating a Dictator is dangerous, and no free people would\r\nwillingly resort to it; but there may be times when this expedient is\r\nnecessary to save a State from ruin, and when every man in a State would\r\ncheerfully give his suffrage for adopting it. At the same time, a\r\ntemporary investiture of unlimited powers in one man, may be abused; it\r\nmay be an influential precedent; and the continuance of it, may furnish\r\nthe Dictator with the means of perpetuating his office. The distress of\r\na people must be extreme, before a serious thought of a Dictator can be\r\njustifiable. But the people who create, can annihilate a Dictator; their\r\nright to govern themselves cannot be resigned by any act whatever, altho\r\nextreme cases may vindicate them in suspending the exercise of it. Even\r\nprescription cannot exist against this right; and _every_ nation in\r\nEurope has a _natural_ right to depose its King, and take the government\r\ninto its own hands; altho it may forever be inexpedient for any of them\r\nto exercise the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VI.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, 1788.\r\n\r\nON GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said,[31] \"that the people ought not to give binding instructions\r\nto Representativs.\" \"That they cannot exercise any act of supremacy or\r\nlegislation at all but in a Convention of the whole State, or of the\r\nRepresentativs of the whole State.\" And \"That the right of election is\r\nthe _only_ constitutional right which they can with propriety exercise.\"\r\nThat these positions, however repugnant to the received opinions of the\r\npresent age, are capable of political demonstration, is to me\r\nunquestionable. They all convey nearly the same idea, and if true, they\r\ncontravene, in some measure, a fundamental maxim of American politics,\r\nwhich is, that \"the sovereign power resides in the people.\"\r\n\r\n    [31] No. II. IV. V.\r\n\r\nI am not desirous of subverting this favorite maxim; but I am very\r\ndesirous it should be properly qualified and understood; for the abuse\r\nof it is capable of shaking any government; and I have no doubt that the\r\nmistakes which this maxim has introduced, have been the principal\r\nsources of rebellion, tumult and disorder in several of the American\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true, that the individuals who compose a political\r\nsociety or State, have a sovereign right to establish what form of\r\ngovernment they please in their own territories. But in order to\r\ndeliberate upon the subject, they must all convene together, as in Rome\r\nand Athens; or must send deputies, vested with powers to act for them,\r\nas is the practice in England and America. If they adopt the first\r\nmethod, then the Supreme Legislativ power resides, to all intents and\r\npurposes, in the whole body of the people. If, from the local\r\ncircumstances of the people, the whole body cannot meet for\r\ndeliberation, then the Legislativ powers do not reside in the people at\r\nlarge, but in an assembly of men delegated by the whole body.\r\n\r\nTo prove this last position, it is necessary to enquire, what is the\r\nobject of law, and on what principles ought it to be founded? A law, if\r\nI understand the term, is an act of the _whole State_, operating upon\r\nthe _whole State_, either by command or prohibition: It is thus\r\ndistinguished from a _resolve_ which more properly respects an\r\nindividual or a part of the State.[32] The object of a law is to prevent\r\npositiv evil or produce positiv good to the _whole State_; not merely to\r\na particular part. The principle therefore on which all laws should be\r\nfounded, is, _a regard to the greatest good which can be produced to the\r\ngreatest number of individuals in the State_. The principle is so\r\nobvious, that I presume it will not be controverted. Permit me then to\r\nenquire, whether the people of any district, county or town, in their\r\nlocal meetings, are competent to judge of this _general good_? A law,\r\nwhich is, in its operation _general_, must be founded on the best\r\n_general information_: The people themselves have no right to consent to\r\na law, without this general information: They have no right to consent\r\nto a law, on a view of a local interest; nor without hearing the\r\nobjections and arguments, and examining the amendments, suggested by\r\nevery part of the community, which is to be affected by that law. To\r\nmaintain the contrary is to defend the most glaring contradictions. But\r\ncan the inhabitants, in detached associations, be acquainted with these\r\nobjections and arguments? Can they know the minds of their brethren at\r\nthe distance of three or five hundred miles? If they cannot, they do not\r\npossess the right of legislation. Little will it avail to say, that the\r\npeople acquire the necessary information by newspapers, or other\r\nperiodical publications: There are not more than two States in the\r\nthirteen, where one half the freemen read the public papers. But if\r\nevery freeman read the papers, this would not give him the information\r\nnecessary to qualify him for a Legislator; for but a small part of the\r\nintelligence they contain is official, which alone can be the ground of\r\nlaw; nor can the collectiv sense of a nation or state be gathered from\r\nnewspapers. The whole body of people, or Representativs of the whole\r\nbody, are the only vehicles of information which can be trusted, in\r\nforming a judgement of the true interest of the whole State.\r\n\r\n    [32] It is a capital defect in some of the States, that the\r\n    government is so organized as not to admit subordinate acts\r\n    of legislation in small districts. In these States, every\r\n    little collection of people in a village must petition the\r\n    Legislature for liberty to lay out a highway or build a\r\n    bridge; an affair in which the State at large has very little\r\n    interest, and of the necessity and utility of which the\r\n    Legislature are not suitable judges. This occasions much\r\n    trouble for the State; it is a needless expense. A State\r\n    should be divided into inferior corporations, veiled with\r\n    powers competent to all acts of local police. What right have\r\n    the inhabitants of Suffolk to interfere in the building of a\r\n    bridge in Montgomery?[a] Who are the most competent judges of\r\n    a local convenience; the whole State, or the inhabitants of\r\n    the particular district?\r\n\r\n         [a] This was written in New York.\r\n\r\nIf the _collectiv sense_ of a State is the basis of law, and that sense\r\ncan be known officially no where but in an Assembly of all the people or\r\nof their Representativs; or in other words, if there can be no such\r\nthing as a _collection of sentiments_ made in any other manner, than by\r\na Convention of the whole people or their Delegates, where is the right\r\nof _instructing Representativs_? The sense of the people, taken in small\r\nmeetings, without a general knowlege of the objections, and reasonings\r\nof the whole State, ought not to be considered as the true sense of the\r\nState; for not being possessed of the best general information, the\r\npeople often form wrong opinions of their own interest. Had I the\r\njournals of the several Legislatures in America, I would prove to every\r\nman's satisfaction, that most of the schemes for paper money, tender\r\nlaws, suspension of laws for the recovery of debts, and most of the\r\ndestructiv measures which have been pursued by the States, have\r\noriginated in towns and counties, and been carried by positiv\r\ninstructions from constituents to Representativs. The freemen, in these\r\ncases, have wrong ideas of their own interest; their error, in the\r\nfirst instance, is ascribeable merely to ignorance, or a want of that\r\njust information, which they themselves would obtain in a General\r\nAssembly.[33] The right therefore of prescribing rules to govern the\r\nvotes of Representativs, which is so often assumed, frequently amounts\r\nto a right of doing infinite mischief, with the best intentions. There\r\nis perhaps no case in which the people at large are so capable of\r\nknowing and pursuing their own interest, as their Delegates are when\r\nassembled for consultation and debate. But the practice of giving\r\nbinding instructions to Representativs, if it has any foundation, is\r\nbuilt on this maxim, that the constituents, on a view of their local\r\ninterests, and either with none, or very imperfect information, are\r\nbetter judges of the propriety of a law, and of the general good, than\r\nthe most judicious men are (for such generally are the Representativs)\r\nafter attending to the best official information from every quarter, and\r\nafter a full discussion of the subject in an Assembly, where clashing\r\ninterests conspire to detect error, and suggest improvements. This maxim\r\nis obviously false; and a practice built on it, cannot fail to produce\r\nlaws, inaccurate, contradictory, capricious and subversive of the first\r\nrights of men. Perhaps no country, except America, ever experienced the\r\nfatal effects of this practice, and I blush to remark, what candor\r\nitself must avow, that few arbitrary governments, have in so short a\r\nperiod, exhibited so many _legal infractions_ of sacred right; so many\r\npublic invasions of private property; so many wanton abuses of\r\nlegislativ powers! Yet the people are generally honest; and as well\r\ninformed as the people of any country. Their errors proceed from\r\nignorance; from false maxims of governments. The people attempt to\r\nlegislate without the necessary qualifications for lawgivers; yes, _they\r\nlegislate at home!_ and while this practice subsists, our public\r\nmeasures will be often weak, imperfect, and changeable; and sometimes\r\n_extremely iniquitous_. From these considerations, it appears that the\r\npowers of a Representativ should be wholly discretionary when he acts as\r\na Legislator; but as an agent for a town or small society, he may have\r\npositiv instructions. His constituents, in the last case, are competent\r\nto instruct him, because they are the whole body concerned; but in the\r\nfirst instance, they are but a part of the State, and not competent to\r\njudge fully of the interest of the whole.\r\n\r\n    [33] An error, originating in mistake, is often pursued thro\r\n    obstinacy and pride; and sometimes a familiarity with\r\n    _falsehood_, makes it appear like _truth_.\r\n\r\nTo place the matter in the strongest point of light, let us suppose a\r\nsmall State, in which the whole body of people meet for the purpose of\r\nmaking laws. Suppose in this democracy, the people of a town or other\r\ndistrict should desire a particular act, for instance, a tender law.\r\nWould the inhabitants of this town, have a right to meet a few weeks\r\nbefore the General Assembly, where they all would expect to be present,\r\nto debate and vote; and in this town meeting take an oath, or otherwise\r\nbind themselves to vote for the act? Would they have a right to shut\r\ntheir ears against argument; to lay a restraint upon their own minds; to\r\nexclude the possibility of conviction, and solemnly swear to vote in a\r\ncertain manner, whether right or wrong! If in this case, the people of a\r\ndistrict have no right to lay a restraint upon themselves before they\r\nenter the General Assembly, neither have they a right, in representativ\r\ndemocracies, to lay such a restraint upon their Delegates. The very\r\nreason why they are incompetent to direct their _Deputies_, is that they\r\ncannot determine how to act _themselves_, till they come into the\r\nAssembly. The very doctrine of representation in government excludes the\r\nright of giving binding instructions to Deputies. The design of choosing\r\nRepresentativs is to _collect the wisdom of the State_; the Deputies are\r\n_to unite_ their Councils; _to meet_ and _consult for_ the public\r\nsafety: But positiv instructions prevent this effect; they are dictated\r\nby local interests, or opinions formed on an imperfect view of facts and\r\narguments; in short they totally counteract the good effects of public\r\ndeliberations, and prevent those salutary measures which may result from\r\nunited Councils. They make the opinions of a small part of the State a\r\nrule for the whole; they imply a decision of a question, before it is\r\nheard; they reduce a Representativ to a mere machine, by restraining the\r\nexercise of his reason; they subvert the very principles of republican\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nBut let us attend to the inconsistency of the practice. The oath\r\nrequired of a Representativ, before he takes his seat, binds him to vote\r\nor act from a regard to the public good, _according to his judgement_\r\nand _the best of his abilities_. Some of the Constitutions contain an\r\noath that binds a Representativ, _not to assent to, or vote for, any act\r\nthat he shall deem injurious to the people_. But what opinion, what\r\njudgement can a man exercise, who is under the restraint of positiv\r\ninstructions? Suppose a man so instructed should in conscience believe\r\nthat a bill, if enacted, would be prejudicial to his constituents, yet\r\nhis orders bind him to vote for it; how would he act between his oath\r\nand his instructions? In his oath he has sworn to act according to his\r\njudgment, and for the good of the people; his instructions forbid him to\r\nuse his judgment, and bind him to vote for a law which he is convinced\r\nwill injure his constituents. He must then either abandon his orders or\r\nhis oath; perjury or disobedience is his only alternativ.\r\n\r\nThis is no imaginary situation; I presume that many men have experienced\r\nit. One very worthy member of the Legislature in this State[34] a few\r\nyears since, was in that very predicament; and I heard him express great\r\nanxiety upon the occasion.\r\n\r\n    [34] New York.\r\n\r\nHow noble was the conduct of that gentleman in Sandwich (Mass.) who,\r\nbeing chosen to represent the town in the late Convention, and\r\ninstructed to vote against the Constitution, _at all events;\r\nnotwithstanding any thing that might be said in favor of it_; rather\r\nthan submit to be fettered in this manner, resigned his appointment. The\r\nname of this gentleman, THOMAS BOURN, Esq. ought to be held in\r\nveneration by every true friend to his country, and his address to the\r\nelectors on that occasion, ought to be written in letters of gold. It\r\nis recorded in these words: \"Fellow Townsmen--The line of conduct which\r\nhas appeared to me right, I have ever wished to pursue. In the decline\r\nof life, when a few revolving suns at most will bring me to the bar of\r\nimpartial justice, I am unwilling to adopt a different, and less honest\r\nmode of acting. It is true, my sentiments at present are not in favor of\r\nthe Constitution; open however to conviction, they may be very\r\ndifferent, when the subject is fairly discussed by able and upright men.\r\nTo place myself in a situation, where conviction could be followed only\r\nby a bigotted persistence in error, would be extremely disagreeable to\r\nme. Under the restrictions with which your Delegates are fettered, _the\r\ngreatest ideot may answer your purpose as well as the greatest man_. The\r\nsuffrages of our fellow men, when they neither repose confidence in our\r\nintegrity, nor pay a tribute of respect to our abilities, can never be\r\nagreeable. I am therefore induced positivly to decline accepting a seat\r\nin Convention, whilst I sincerely wish you, gentlemen, and my\r\ncountrymen, every blessing which a wise and virtuous administration of a\r\nfree government can secure.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a bold and honest independence of mind are the marks of a good\r\nLegislator. With such men as Mr. Bourn, in the legislativ department,\r\nour lives, liberties and properties are safe. Such a genius, rising\r\namidst the obscurity of errors and false maxims, like a star emerging\r\nfrom chaos, spreads the rays of truth and illuminates the surrounding\r\nhemisphere. Considering the circumstances in which this gentleman was\r\nthen placed, I had rather be the author of that short address, than of\r\nall the labored dissertations which have been written upon the proposed\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nAnother error, which is connected with the practice of instructing\r\nRepresentativs, and may perhaps be one cause of it, is the opinion that\r\na Deputy chosen by a certain number of freemen, is _their Representativ\r\nonly_ or _particularly_: It seems to be believed that a Representativ is\r\nbound to attend to the _particular interest of the men who elect him_,\r\nrather than to the _general interest_. If this were true, it would\r\nobviate, in some measure, the objections against instructions. But with\r\nrespect to every general act, the opinion is _clearly false_. The reason\r\nwhy men are chosen by small societies of freemen, and not by the whole\r\nbody, is, that the whole body cannot be well acquainted with the most\r\nable men in the different parts of the State. It is the best expedient\r\nto correct the defects of government, or rather, it is the best\r\n_practicable_ mode of election. To render the mode perfect, the _whole\r\nbody of freemen_ should be at liberty to choose their Delegates from the\r\n_whole body_. This would destroy, in a great measure, the local views\r\nand attachments which now embarrass government; every Representativ\r\nwould be chosen by the whole body; and the interest of the whole number\r\nof constituents would be his object.\r\n\r\nThis mode is either impracticable or hazardous; notwithstanding this,\r\nwhen a Delegate is elected by a _part_ of the State, he is really the\r\nRepresentativ of the _whole_, as much as if he were _elected_ by the\r\nwhole. The constituents of every Representativ are not solely those who\r\n_voted_ for him, but the _whole State_, and the man that acts from a\r\n_local_ interest, and attends merely to the wishes of those men who\r\nelected him, violates his oath, and abuses his trust. Hence the\r\nabsurdity of instructions, which are generally dictated by a partial\r\ninterest, and can perhaps in no case be the sole rule of a Legislator's\r\nconduct. When therefore a Representativ says, _such is the wish of my\r\nconstituents; such are their directions_; his declaration is but\r\npartially true; for his instructions are the wishes of a _part_ only of\r\nhis constituents. His constituents, whom he actually represents, and\r\nwhose greatest interest is the sole rule of his conduct, are _the whole\r\nbody of freemen_. This is an important truth, and I must repeat it; the\r\nman who is deputed to make laws for a State, and suffers a local\r\ninterest to influence his conduct, abuses a sacred trust; and the\r\nRepresentativ who obeys his instructions, in opposition to the\r\nconviction of his own mind, arising from a general view of public good,\r\n_is guilty of a species of perjury_.\r\n\r\nSuch are the opinions, which after long deliberation, I have formed\r\nrespecting the principles of a republican government. I feel a\r\ndiffidence in publishing sentiments so repugnant to the principles\r\nreceived by my countrymen and recognized by some of the State\r\nConstitutions. But a strong persuasion of the truth of these opinions,\r\nacquired by reasoning, and confirmed by several years observations,\r\nforbids me to suppress them.\r\n\r\nA summary of the truths, deduced from the foregoing reasoning, is this:\r\nThat the power of a State is at all times equal; that neither the people\r\nthemselves, nor a Convention of their Delegates, have either the power\r\nor the right to make an unalterable Constitution; that the power of\r\ncreating a legislativ body, or the sovereign right of election, is\r\nsolely in the people; but the sovereign power of making laws is solely\r\nin an Assembly of their Representativs; that the people have no right to\r\ngive binding instructions to their Representativs; consequently a\r\ndistinction between a _Convention_ and a _Legislature_, can be merely a\r\ndifference of _forms_; that Representativs have no right to prolong the\r\nperiod of their delegation; that being taken from the mass of the\r\npeople, and having a common interest with them, they will be influenced,\r\neven by private interest, to promote the public good; and that such a\r\ngovernment, which is a novelty on earth, is perhaps the best that can be\r\nframed, and the only form which will always have for its object, the\r\ngeneral good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VII.\r\n\r\n                         PHILADELPHIA, 1787.\r\n\r\nREMARKS _on the_ MANNERS, GOVERNMENT, _and_ DEBT _of the_ UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the declaration and establishment of a general peace, and since\r\nthis country has had an opportunity to experience the effects of her\r\nindependence, events have taken place, which were little expected by the\r\nfriends of the revolution. It was expected, that on the ratification of\r\npeace, by the belligerent powers, America would enjoy perfect political\r\ntranquillity. The statesman in his closet, and the divine in his\r\naddresses to heaven, predicted and anticipated the happy period, when\r\nevery man would rest, unmolested, under his own vine and his own fig\r\ntree. The merchant foresaw, in vision, the ports of all nations open to\r\nhis ships, and the returns of a favorable commerce pouring wealth into\r\nhis coffers. The honest laborer, in the shop and the field, was told\r\nthat independence and peace would forever remove the fears of\r\noppression, would lighten his burthen, and give him legal security for\r\nthe uninterrupted possession of his rights. This flattering prospect\r\ninspired an irresistible enthusiasm in war. The contention for freedom\r\nwas long and arduous; the prize was obtained; the delusion vanished, and\r\nAmerica is surprized at the disappointment.\r\n\r\nInstead of general tranquillity, _one_ State has been involved in a\r\ncivil war, and most of them are torn with factions, which weaken or\r\ndestroy the energy of government. Instead of a free commerce with all\r\nthe world, our trade is every where fettered with restraints and\r\nimpositions, dictated by foreign interest; and instead of pouring wealth\r\ninto our country, its present tendency is, to impoverish both the\r\nmerchant and the public. Instead of legal security of rights under\r\ngovernments of our own choice, and under our own control, we find\r\nproperty at least unsafe, even in our best toned government. Our\r\ncharters may be wrested from us without a fault, our contracts may be\r\nchanged or set aside without our consent, by the breath of a popular\r\nLegislature. Instead of a dimunition of taxes, our public charges are\r\nmultiplied; and to the weight of accumulating debts, we are perpetually\r\nmaking accessions by expensiv follies. Instead of a union of States and\r\nmeasures, essential to the welfare of a great nation, each State is\r\njealous of its neighbor, and struggling for the superiority in wealth\r\nand importance, at the hazard even of our federal existence.\r\n\r\nThis is the dark side of our public affairs; but such are the facts. The\r\npublic and private embarrassments, which are both seen and felt, are the\r\ntopics of incessant declamation. The rhapsodies of orators, and the\r\npublications in gazettes, from the northern to the southern extremity of\r\nthe United States, concur in deprecating the present state of this\r\ncountry, and communicate the intelligence of our distresses to the whole\r\ncivilized world. Nor are newspapers the only heralds of our calamities.\r\nThe contempt of government among one class of men, the silent murmurs of\r\npoverty in the peaceful cottage, and numerous bankrupts in every\r\nquarter, are irresistible evidence to a thinking mind, that something is\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nBut declamation is idle, and murmurs fruitless. Time has been when the\r\nminds of people were alarmed at the approaches of despotism: Then\r\nharangues roused attention; then mobs raised the temple of freedom, and\r\ndeclared themselves ready to be sacrificed upon her altar. But violent\r\npassions in the public as well as in the human body, are always\r\ntransitory. That enthusiasm which was called _public spirit, heroic\r\nvirtue, and love of country_, has long ago subsided, and is absorbed in\r\nthe general steady principle, private interest. That enthusiasm is not\r\nto be rekindled. The expostulations of our rulers and patriotic\r\nwriters, have no more effect in reviving public spirit, than the\r\nattraction of a meteor in raising a tide.\r\n\r\nMen, who embraced revolution principles, because independence might save\r\na few shillings in taxes, or extend the imaginary sphere of freedom; who\r\nexpected that peace would place them in a paradise of blessings, where\r\nthey might riot without the fatigue of exertion; such men had narrow\r\nviews of the consequence of detaching America from a transatlantic\r\njurisdiction. They viewed but a small part of the great event: They are,\r\nthey _ought to be_ disappointed. Such men expect effects without causes,\r\nand are ready to despond, or commence enemies to a glorious event,\r\nbecause miracles are not wrought to verify their ill founded\r\npredictions.\r\n\r\nIn this view, this insect view of things, the revolution ought to be\r\nconsidered as extremely unfortunate; for to the present generation, it\r\nmust certainly prove so.\r\n\r\nBut on the general scale of human happiness, every man of reflection\r\nmust rejoice at the illustrious event. Even the propriety of the\r\nindependence of these States, is so obviously dictated by their local\r\nsituation, that a generous European ought to have consented to the\r\nmeasure on this single principle. But taking into consideration the vast\r\nfield which is here opened for improvements in science, in government,\r\nin religion, and in morals; the philosopher will felicitate himself with\r\nthe prospect of discoveries favorable to arts and happiness; the\r\nstatesman will rejoice that there is a retreat from the vassalage of\r\nEurope; the divine will bless God that a place has been reserved for an\r\nuncorrupted church; and the philanthropist, who compares the yeomanry of\r\nAmerica with the peasantry of Europe, will congratulate himself on an\r\nevent which has removed millions of people from the ambition of princes,\r\nand from a participation of the vices, which mark the decline of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of America, whatever may be the present effects, must, on\r\nthe universal scale of policy, prove fortunate, not only for the\r\nparties, but for mankind in general. The period, however, when this\r\ncountry will realize the happy consequences of her separation, must be\r\nremote; probably beyond the lives of the present generation.\r\n\r\nIt is worth our curiosity to inquire into the causes of our present\r\npolitical evils; not the more obvious causes, which every man sees and\r\nlaments, but those radical causes which lie hid from common observation;\r\nwhose operations are imperceptible, but whose effects are visible, even\r\nto a vulgar eye.\r\n\r\nA fundamental mistake of the Americans has been, that they considered\r\nthe revolution as completed, when it was but just begun. Having raised\r\nthe pillars of the building, they ceased to exert themselves, and seemed\r\nto forget that the whole superstructure was then to be erected. This\r\ncountry is independent in government; but totally dependent in manners,\r\nwhich are the basis of government. Men seem not to attend to the\r\ndifference between Europe and America, in point of age and improvement;\r\nand are disposed to rush, with heedless emulation, into an imitation of\r\nmanners, for which we are not prepared.\r\n\r\nEvery person tolerably well versed in history, knows that nations are\r\noften compared to individuals and to vegetables, in their progress from\r\ntheir origin to maturity and decay. The resemblance is striking and\r\njust. This progress is as certain in nations as in vegetables; it is as\r\nobvious, and its causes more easily understood; in proportion as the\r\nsecret springs of action in government are more easily explained, than\r\nthe mechanical principles of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThis progress therefore being assumed as a conceded fact, suggests a\r\nforcible argument against the introduction of European manners into\r\nAmerica. The business of men in society is, first, to secure their\r\npersons and estates by arms and wholesome laws; then to procure the\r\nconveniences of life by arts and labor; but it is in the last stages\r\nonly of national improvement, when luxury and amusements become public\r\nbenefits, by dissipating accumulations of wealth, and furnishing\r\nemployment and food for the poor. And luxury then is not beneficial,\r\nexcept when the wealth of a nation is wasted within itself. It is\r\nperhaps always true, that an old civilized nation cannot, with\r\npropriety, be the model for an infant nation, either in morals, in\r\nmanners or fashions, in literature or in government.\r\n\r\nThe present ambition of Americans is, to introduce as fast as possible,\r\nthe fashionable amusements of the European courts. Considering the\r\nformer dependence of America on England, her descent, her connexion and\r\npresent intercourse, this ambition cannot surprise us. But it must check\r\nthis ambition to reflect on the consequences. It will not be denied,\r\nthat there are vices predominant in the most polite cities in Europe,\r\nwhich are not only unknown, but are seldom mentioned in America; and\r\nvices that are infamous beyond conception. I presume it will not be\r\ndenied that there must be an amazing depravation of mind in a nation,\r\nwhere a farce is a publication of more consequence than Milton's Poem;\r\nand where an opera dancer, or an Italian singer, receives a salary equal\r\nto that of an Ambassador. The facts being known and acknowleged, I\r\npresume the consequence will not be denied. Not that this charge is good\r\nagainst every individual; even in the worst times, there will be found\r\nmany exceptions to the general character of a nation.\r\n\r\nIf these vices and the depravation of mind do actually exist, it is a\r\nproof of a gradual corruption; for there was a time when they did not\r\nexist. There was a time when decency was a virtue, even at Venice. The\r\nprogress is also slow, unless hastened by some external circumstances.\r\nIt was more than two thousand years from the building of Rome to the\r\npontificate of Alexander the VIth whose naked revelings filled the\r\nmeasure of public vice, and strike the human mind with horror.\r\n\r\nA constant increase of wealth is ever followed by a multiplication of\r\nvices: This seems to be the destiny of human affairs; wisdom, therefore,\r\ndirects us to retard, if possible, and not to accelerate the progress\r\nof corruption. But an introduction of the fashionable diversions of\r\nEurope into America, is an acceleration of the growth of vices which are\r\nyet in their infancy, and an introduction of new ones too infamous to be\r\nmentioned. A dancing school among the Tuscaroras, is not a greater\r\nabsurdity than a masquerade in America. A theater, under the best\r\nregulations, is not essential to our public and private happiness. It\r\nmay afford entertainment to individuals; but it is at the expense of\r\nprivate taste and public morals. The great misfortune of all exhibitions\r\nof this kind is this; that they reduce all taste to a level. Not only\r\nthe vices of all classes of people are brought into view, but of all\r\nages and nations. The intrigues of a nobleman, and the scurrility of\r\nshoe blacks, are presented to the view of both sexes, of all ages; the\r\nvices of the age of Elizabeth and of Charles IId are recorded by the\r\nmasterly pens of a Shakespeare and a Congreve, and by repeated\r\nrepresentation, they are \"hung on high,\" as the poet expresses it, \"to\r\npoison half mankind.\" The fact is, that all characters must be presented\r\nupon a theater, because all characters are spectators; and a nobleman\r\nand a sailor, a dutchess and a washer woman, that attend constantly on\r\nthe exhibitions of vice, become equally depraved; their tastes will be\r\nnearly alike as to vice; the one is as prepared for a crime as the\r\nother. It is for this reason, that many of the amusements of nations\r\nmore depraved than ourselves, are highly pernicious in this country.\r\nThey carry us forward by hasty strides, to the last stages of\r\ncorruption; a period that every benevolent man will deprecate and\r\nendeavor to retard. This circumstance, the difference in the stages of\r\nour political existence, should make us shun the vices which may be\r\npolitic and even necessary in older states; and endeavor to preserve our\r\nmanners by being our own standards. By attaching ourselves to foreign\r\nmanners, we counteract the good effects of the revolution, or rather\r\nrender them incomplete. A revolution in the form of government, is but a\r\nrevolution in name; unless attended with a change of principles and\r\nmanners, which are the springs of government.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to treat more particularly of the influence of fashions on\r\nthe interests of these States; an article in which the ladies are deeply\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nFashion in itself is a matter of indifference, as affecting neither\r\nmorals nor politeness. It is of no consequence whether a lady is clad\r\nwith a gown or a frock; or whether a gentleman appears in public with a\r\ncap or a wig. But there may be times and situations in which the most\r\ntrifling things become important. The practice of imitating foreign\r\nmodes of dress, cannot cost America less than 100,000l. a year. I speak\r\nnot of the necessary articles of dress; but merely of changes of\r\nfashions.\r\n\r\nTo understand this fact, it is necessary to advert to the different\r\ncircumstances of this country, and of the European kingdoms, which we\r\ntake as our models.\r\n\r\nTwo circumstances distinguish most of the commercial countries of Europe\r\nfrom America; a feudal division of real property, and manufactures.\r\nWhere vast estates are hereditary and unalienable, a great part of the\r\npeople are dependent on the rich, and if the rich do not employ them,\r\nthey must starve. Thus in England and France, a great landholder\r\npossesses a hundred times the property that is necessary for the\r\nsubsistence of a family; and each landlord has perhaps a hundred\r\nfamilies dependent on him for subsistence. On this statement, if the\r\nlandlord should live penuriously, and supply his own family only with\r\nnecessaries, all his dependents must starve. In order to subsist the\r\nninety nine families, he must create wants, which their employment must\r\nsupply; for the natural wants of a few rich people will not furnish\r\nemployment for great multitudes of poor. Hence the good policy, the\r\nnecessity of luxury in most European kingdoms. Hence originate all the\r\nchanges and varieties of fashion. A gentleman or lady in London must not\r\nappear in public twice in the same suit. This is a regulation of custom,\r\nbut it is highly political; for were the nobility and rich gentry to\r\nwear out all their clothes, one half the people must be beggars. The\r\nfashions of England and France are not merely matter of fancy: Fancy may\r\ndictate new and odd figures in dress; but the general design of frequent\r\nand continual changes of fashion, is wise systematic policy, at the\r\ncourts of London and Paris.\r\n\r\nBut let us see with how little discretion and policy _we_ adopt foreign\r\nluxuries. America is a young country, with small inequalities of\r\nproperty, and without manufactures. Few people are here dependent on the\r\nrich, for every man has an opportunity of becoming rich himself.\r\nConsequently few people are supported by the luxuries of the wealthy;\r\nand even these few are mostly foreigners.\r\n\r\nBut we have no body of manufacturers to support by dissipation. All our\r\nsuperfluities are imported, and the consumption of them in this country\r\nenriches the merchants and supports the poor of Europe. We are generous\r\nindeed! generous to a fault. This is the pernicious, the fatal effect of\r\nour dependence on foreign nations for our manners. We labor day and\r\nnight, we sacrifice our peace and reputation, we defraud our public\r\ncreditors, involve ourselves in debts, impoverish our country: Nay, many\r\nare willing to become bankrupts and take lodgings in a prison, for the\r\nsake of being as foolish as those nations which subsist their poor and\r\ngrow rich and respectable by their follies.\r\n\r\nNo objection can be made to rich and elegant dresses among people of\r\naffluent circumstances. But perhaps we may safely calculate that one\r\nthird of the expenses incurred by dress in this country, add nothing\r\neither to convenience or elegance.\r\n\r\nA new dress is invented in London or Paris, not for the sake of superior\r\nelegance, because it frequently happens that a new dress is less rich\r\nand elegant than an old one; but for the sake of giving food to\r\nmanufacturers. That new fashion is sent across the Atlantic; let it be\r\never so troublesome and uncouth, we admire its novelty; we adopt it\r\nbecause it is fashionable; and merely for a change, that may be made in\r\nhalf an hour by a tailor or a milliner, 20, 30, or 50,000 pounds are\r\ndrawn from the capital stocks of property in America, to enrich nations\r\nwhich command our commerce and smile at our folly.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the wealth of this country that is sacrificed by our\r\nservile imitation of other nations; our complaisance often requires us\r\nto dispense with good taste.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be admitted that amidst the infinite variety of dresses\r\nwhich are fashionable, during a course of ten or fifteen years, some of\r\nthem must be more convenient and elegant than others. True taste in\r\ndress consists in setting off the person to the best advantage. That\r\ndress which unites the articles of convenience, simplicity and neatness,\r\nin the greatest perfection, must be considered as the most elegant. But\r\ntrue taste goes farther; it has reference to age, to shape, to\r\ncomplexion, and to the season of the year. The same dress which adorns a\r\nmiss of fifteen, will be frightful on a venerable lady of seventy. The\r\nsame dress will embellish one lady and disfigure another. But the\r\npassive disposition of Americans in receiving every mode that is offered\r\nthem, sometimes reduces all ages, shapes and complexions to a level.\r\n\r\nI will not undertake to say that people ought not, in the article of\r\ndress, to sacrifice taste to national interest. A sacrifice of that\r\nkind, in a manufacturing country, may be laudable; it will at least be\r\npardonable. But in a reverse of situation, in America, where a waste of\r\nproperty and a group of political evils accompany a bad taste, the\r\nsacrifice admits of no apology.\r\n\r\nIt is not unfrequent to hear ladies complain severely of the\r\ninconvenience of fashion. Their good sense disapproves and their taste\r\nrevolts at incumbrances. And yet where is the lady who would not sooner\r\nsubmit to any fatigue, rather than be ridiculous. I speak of ladies\r\nparticularly; in point of expense, the gentlemens' dresses are\r\nexceptionable as well as the ladies; in point of convenience, the ladies\r\nare the greatest sufferers by fashion, as their dress admits of the\r\ngreatest variety of incumbrances.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the trouble of conforming entirely to the fashions of Europe is\r\nas great a tax upon the ladies, as the expense is to their husbands and\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nOne society of people, the Friends, are happily released from the\r\ntyranny and inconveniencies of fashion. However disagreeable the\r\nrestraints of their religion may appear in other respects, it must be\r\nacknowledged that, in point of dress, the rules of their society conform\r\nto purity of taste.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may safely estimate, that the ladies of that society dress\r\nwith two thirds of the expense which other ladies incur, even when the\r\narticles of their dress are equally rich and expensiv; the difference is\r\nsaved by neglecting superfluous finery. And are not their taste in\r\ndress, their simplicity and neatness, universally admired? Does it not\r\nset off their persons to the best advantage? Do not gentlemen almost\r\nuniversally give the preference to the taste of Quaker ladies? Nay, I\r\nwould ask, whether other ladies themselves, under a strong bias in favor\r\nof a tawdry dress, are not frequently lavishing encomiums on the\r\nsuperior elegance and convenience of the Friends' dresses? And how often\r\ndo they sigh beneath the trouble of their own dress, and wish that\r\nparticular articles would go out of fashion.\r\n\r\nIf there is any thing on earth, which can make a rational mind disgusted\r\nwith society, it is that cruel necessity, which obliges a person to\r\nsacrifice both his interest and his taste, or run the hazard of being\r\nlaughed at for his singularity.\r\n\r\nIn some Asiatic countries, people never change their modes of dress.\r\nThis uniformity, which continues for ages, proceeds from the same\r\nprinciples as the monthly changes in England and France; both proceed\r\nfrom necessity and policy. Both arise from good causes which operate in\r\nthe several governments; that is, the manners of each government are\r\nsubservient to its particular interest. The reverse is true of this\r\ncountry. Our manners are wholly subservient to the interest of foreign\r\nnations. Where do we find, in dress or equipage, the least reference to\r\nthe circumstances of this country! Is it not the sole ambition of the\r\nAmericans to be just like other nations, without the means of supporting\r\nthe resemblance? We ought not to harbor any spleen or prejudice against\r\nforeign kingdoms. This would be illiberal. They are wise, they are\r\nrespectable. We should despise the man that piques himself on his own\r\ncountry, and treats all others with indiscriminate contempt. I wish to\r\nsee much less jealousy and ill nature subsisting between the Americans\r\nand English. But in avoiding party spirit and resentment on the one\r\nhand, we should be very careful of servility on the other. There is a\r\nmanly pride in true independence, which is equally remote from insolence\r\nand meanness; a pride that is characteristic of great minds. Have\r\nAmericans discovered this pride since the declaration of peace? We boast\r\nof independence, and with propriety. But will not the same men, who\r\nglory in this great event, even in the midst of a gasconade, turn to a\r\nforeigner and ask him, \"what is the latest fashion in Europe!\" He has\r\nworn an elegant suit of clothes for six weeks; he might wear it a few\r\nweeks longer, but it has not so many buttons as the last suit of my\r\nlord ----: He throws it aside, and gets one that has. The suit costs him\r\na sum of money; but it keeps him in the fashion, and feeds the poor of\r\nGreat Britain or France. It is a singular phenomenon, and to posterity\r\nit will appear incredible, that a nation of heroes, who have conquered\r\narmies, and raised an empire, should not have the spirit to say--_we\r\nwill wear our clothes as we please_.\r\n\r\nLet it not be thought that this is a trifling subject; a matter of no\r\nconsequence. Mankind are governed by opinion; and while we flatter\r\nourselves that we enjoy independence, because no foreign power can\r\nimpose laws upon us, we are groaning beneath the tyranny of opinion; a\r\ntyranny more severe than the laws of monarchs; a dominion voluntary\r\nindeed, but for that reason, more effectual; an authority of manners\r\nwhich commands our services, and sweeps away the fruits of our labor.\r\n\r\nI repeat the sentiment with which I began; the revolution of America is\r\nyet incomplete. We are now in a situation to answer all the purposes of\r\nthe European nations; independent in government, and dependent in\r\nmanners. They give us their fashions, they direct _our_ taste to make a\r\nmarket for _their_ commodities; they engross the profits of our\r\nindustry, without the hazard of defending us, or the expense of\r\nsupporting our civil government. A situation more favorable to _their_\r\ninterest, or more repugnant to our _own_, _they_ could not have chosen\r\nfor us, nor _we_ embraced.\r\n\r\nIf such is the state of facts, and if the influence of foreign manners\r\ndoes actually defeat the purposes of the revolution; if our implicit\r\nsubmission to the prevailing taste of European courts, involves\r\nindividuals and the public in unnecessary expenses, it is in the power\r\nof a few influential characters in each of our commercial cities to\r\nremedy the whole evil. And in a reformation of this kind, the ladies\r\nwould have no inconsiderable share.\r\n\r\nIt is really a matter of astonishment, that the pride of the Americans\r\nhas so long submitted tamely to a foreign yoke. Aside of all regard to\r\ninterest, we should expect that the idea of being a nation of apes would\r\nmortify minds accustomed to freedom of thought, and would prompt them to\r\nspurn their chains.\r\n\r\nHave the ladies in America no ingenuity, no taste? Do they not\r\nunderstand what dresses are most convenient and elegant? What modes are\r\nbest adapted to the climate, or other circumstances of this country?\r\nThey most certainly do. Foreigners acknowlege that the nativ beauty and\r\nunderstanding of the American ladies are not excelled in any country,\r\nand equalled in very few. And one would imagin that the modes of\r\nembellishing so many personal charms ought not, in all cases, to be\r\nprescribed by the milliners and manteau makers on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic. A noble pride should forbid that ladies of birth and breeding\r\nshould be wholly indebted to the taste of others, for the decorations of\r\ntheir beauty.\r\n\r\nWhen the gentlemen in America shall exercise spirit enough to be their\r\nown judges of taste in dress: When they have wisdom to consult the\r\ncircumstances of this country, and fortitude enough to retain a fashion\r\nas long as their _own interest_ requires, instead of changing it when\r\n_other nations_ direct: When the ladies shall exercise the rights of\r\ntheir sex, and say, we will _give_ the laws of fashion to our _own\r\nnation_, instead of _receiving_ them from _another_, we will perform our\r\npart of the revolution: When both sexes shall take more pride and\r\npleasure in being their own standards, than in being the humble\r\nimitators of those who riot on the profits of our commerce; we shall\r\nrealize a new species of independence; an independence flattering to\r\ngenerous minds, and more productive of wealth than all the laws of\r\npower, or the little arts of national policy. And in this revolution of\r\nmanners, there needs not any sacrifice of real dress. I will venture to\r\nestimate, that the retrenching of superfluous articles; articles which\r\nconstitute no part of dress, and serve but to disfigure an elegant\r\nperson; articles that are made and sent to us to support the sixpenny\r\nday laborers of Europe; I say, a retrenching of these trifling articles\r\nonly, would be an annual saving to America sufficient to pay one half of\r\nthe interest of our federal debt. We can throw no blame on foreign\r\nnations; they are wise, and profit by our want of spirit and taste.\r\n\r\nOn the footing that all mankind are brethren, perhaps it is generous in\r\nus to assist foreigners, who are a part of the Great Family.\r\n\r\nIt is to be wished, however, that we might first discharge our honest\r\ndebts: That the soldier, whose labor and blood have purchased our\r\nempire, and whose services have been repaid with a shadow of reward,\r\nmight be indemnified by the justice of his country: That the widow and\r\norphan might at least receive the stipulated satisfaction for losses\r\nwhich money cannot repair. Yes, let us first be _just_, and then\r\n_generous_. When we have no better use for our superfluous property,\r\nthen let us bestow it upon our wretched brethren of the human race. They\r\nwill repay our charity with gratitude, and bless God that he has peopled\r\none half the world with a race of freemen, to enrich the tyrants, and\r\nsupport the vassals of the other.\r\n\r\nIn another particular, our dependence on nations farther advanced in\r\nsociety than ourselves, has a very unhappy effect.\r\n\r\nI assume it as a fact, conceded by all philosophers and historians, that\r\nthere has been, in every civilized nation, a particular period of time,\r\npeculiarly favorable to literary researches; and that in this period,\r\nlanguage and taste arrive to purity; the best authors flourish, and\r\ngenius is exerted to benefit mankind.\r\n\r\nThis period in Greece was the age of Themistocles, immediately after the\r\ninvasion of Xerxes. In Rome, it was the reign of Augustus Cæsar, when a\r\nrevolution had left the empire in a state of tranquillity. In France,\r\nthe reign of Louis the XIVth was distinguished for the number and\r\neminence of its authors, and the correctness of taste. The corresponding\r\nperiod of taste in England, commenced about the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and ended with the reign of George the IId. Scotland was later\r\nin improvement; but perhaps has now seen its meridian splendor.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a certain point of improvement beyond which every step\r\nin refinement is corruption; moral sentiment is postponed to wit, and\r\nsense is sacrificed to sound. This has been the case in all nations, and\r\nis now true of England. The candid among the nation acknowlege and\r\nlament the decline of true taste and science. Very few valuable writings\r\nappear in the present age; plays, novels, farces, and compilations fill\r\nthe catalogue of new publications; and the library of a man of fashion\r\nconsists of Chesterfield's Letters, Tristram Shandy, and a few comedies.\r\n\r\nA gentleman in high office in London, in a letter to an eminent literary\r\ncharacter in America, which I had the honor to read, informs, \"that so\r\nlow is the taste of the nation, that were Milton's Poem to be now first\r\npublished, it would not find purchasers: Music and painting are the only\r\narts that have royal encouragement.\" He says further, \"that there is a\r\nnational combination to oppose the fame of every American art,\r\nproduction and character.\" I would hope that this account is an\r\nexaggeration of the truth; but we have the best testimony to convince us\r\nthat every thing is sacrificed to amusement and pleasure.\r\n\r\nWe ought not therefore to form our taste after such models: In order to\r\nwrite, think and act with propriety, we should go back half a century,\r\nto the style and morality of Addison and his cotemporaries; there we may\r\nfind the most perfect models.\r\n\r\nBy making the present taste of Europe our standards, we not only debase\r\nour own, but we check the attempts of genius in this country.\r\n\r\nEminence is sometimes apt to impose errors upon people, whose respect\r\nfor the character may silence all scruple, and prevent them from\r\nexamining into the grounds of his opinion. Such is the implicit\r\nconfidence reposed in the opinions of certain celebrated writers, that\r\nwhen an American ventures to call in question a received principle or\r\nopinion of theirs, his countrymen charge him with arrogance, and\r\nexclaim, how should this man be as good a judge of the subject as a\r\nforeigner! Such false notions of the perfection of particular character,\r\nfetter the mind, and in concert with credulity and idleness, prepare it\r\nfor the reception of any errors, however enormous.\r\n\r\nThis same veneration for eminent foreigners, and the bewitching charms\r\nof fashion, have led the Americans to adopt the modern corruptions of\r\nour language. Very seldom have men examined the structure of the\r\nlanguage, to find reasons for their practice. The pronunciation and use\r\nof words have been subject to the same arbitrary or accidental changes,\r\nas the shape of their garments. My lord wears a hat of a certain size\r\nand shape; he pronounces a word in a certain manner; and both must be\r\nright, for he is a fashionable man. In Europe this is right in dress;\r\nand men who have not an opportunity of learning the just rules of our\r\nlanguage, are in some degree excuseable for imitating those whom they\r\nconsider as superiors. But in men of science, this imitation can hardly\r\nbe excused.\r\n\r\nOur language was spoken in purity about eighty years ago; since which\r\ntime, great numbers of faults have crept into practice about the theater\r\nand court of London. An affected erroneous pronunciation has in many\r\ninstances taken place of the true; and new words or modes of speech have\r\nsucceeded the ancient correct English phrases.\r\n\r\nThus we have, in the modern English pronunciation, their natshures,\r\nconjunctshures, constitshutions, and tshumultshuous legislatshures; and\r\na long catalogue of fashionable improprieties. These are a direct\r\nviolation of the rules of analogy and harmony; they offend the ear, and\r\nembarrass the language. Time was, when these errors were unknown; they\r\nwere little known in America before the revolution. I presume we may\r\nsafely say, that our language has suffered more injurious changes in\r\nAmerica, since the British army landed on our shores, than it had\r\nsuffered before, in the period of three centuries. The bucks and bloods\r\ntell us that there is no proper standard in language; that it is all\r\narbitrary. The assertion, however, serves but to show their ignorance.\r\nThere are, in the language itself, decisive reasons for preferring one\r\npronunciation to another; and men of science should be acquainted with\r\nthese reasons. But if there were none, and every thing rested on\r\npractice, we should never change a general practice without substantial\r\nreasons: No change should be introduced, which is not an obvious\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nBut our leading characters seem to pay no regard to rules, or their\r\nformer practice. To know and embrace every change made in Great Britain,\r\nwhether right or wrong, is the extent of their inquiries, and the height\r\nof their ambition. It is to this deference we may ascribe the long\r\ncatalogue of errors in pronunciation and of false idioms which disfigure\r\nthe language of our mighty fine speakers. And should this imitation\r\ncontinue, we shall be hurried down the stream of corruption, with older\r\nnations, and our language, with theirs, be lost in an ocean of perpetual\r\nchanges. The only hope we can entertain is, that America, driven by the\r\nshock of a revolution, from the rapidity of the current, may glide along\r\nnear the margin with a gentler stream, and sometimes be wafted back by\r\nan eddy.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks suggest some of the causes which operate to defeat\r\nthe true end of the revolution. Every man sees and feels our political\r\nembarrassments; the foes of the revolution ascribe them all to that\r\nevent, and the friends charge them upon the enmity and resentment of our\r\nparent country. Both are wrong. The revolution is, and will ultimately\r\nprove, a happy event for us and for the world. The English, as a nation,\r\nare wise and respectable: As citizens of the world, we should esteem\r\nthem: As a commercial people, we should cultivate a friendly intercourse\r\nwith them; but as a foreign nation, whose political circumstances are\r\nvery different from ours, we should not make them, in all cases, our\r\nstandard. I repeat the declaration I before made: The independence of\r\nthis country is incomplete: There has been a total change in government,\r\nwith little or no change in the principles which give energy to the\r\noperations of government.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding remarks, I have endeavored to shew in what respect the\r\nrevolution of America is yet incomplete, and that an independence of\r\nmanners and opinion is necessary to give full effect to an independence\r\nof government. I propose now to make some remarks on government, to\r\nstate the effects of the revolution on the morals of people, and the\r\ninfluence of money on mens' sense of justice and moral obligation.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps a fundamental principle of government, that men are\r\ninfluenced more by habit, than by any abstract ideas of right and wrong.\r\nFew people examin into the propriety of particular usages or laws; or\r\nif they examin, few indeed are capable of comprehending their propriety.\r\nBut every man knows what is a law or general practice, and he conforms\r\nto it, not because it is right or best, but because it has been the\r\npractice. It is for this reason that habits of obedience should not be\r\ndisturbed. There are perhaps in every government, some laws and customs,\r\nwhich, when examined on theoretical principles, will be found unjust and\r\neven impolitic. But if the people acquiesce in those laws and customs,\r\nif they are attached to them by habit, it is wrong in the Legislature to\r\nattempt an innovation which shall alarm their apprehensions. There are\r\nmultitudes of absurdities practised in society, in which people are\r\nevidently happy. Arraign those absurdities before the tribunal of\r\nexamination; people may be convinced of their impropriety; they may even\r\nbe convinced that better schemes may be projected; and yet it might be\r\nimpossible to unite their opinions so as to establish different maxims.\r\nOn the other hand, there are many good institutions, in which, however,\r\nthere may be theoretical faults, which, if called into public view, and\r\nartfully represented, might shake the best government on earth.\r\n\r\nSpeculativ philosophers and historians have often described, and\r\nsometimes ridiculed the warmth with which nations have defended errors\r\nin religion and government. With the most profound deference for wise\r\nand respectable men, I must think they are guilty of a mistake; and that\r\nthe errors which nations fight to defend, exist only in the heads of\r\nthese theorists. Whatever speculation may tell us, experience and the\r\npeace of society, require us to consider every thing as right, which a\r\nnation believes to be so. Every institution, every custom, may be deemed\r\njust and proper, which does not produce inconveniencies that the bulk of\r\nmankind may see and feel. The tranquillity of society therefore should\r\nnever be disturbed for a philosophical distinction.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be objected, that these doctrines, if practised, would\r\nprevent all improvements, in science, religion and government. By no\r\nmeans; but they point out the method in which all improvements should be\r\nmade, when opinion and fixed habits are to be overthrown, or changed.\r\nThey show that all reformation should be left to the natural progress of\r\nsociety, or to the conviction of the mind. They show the hazard and\r\nimpracticability of making changes, before the minds of the body of the\r\npeople are prepared for the innovation. I speak not of despotic\r\ngovernments, where the will of the prince is enforced by an army; and\r\nyet even absolute tyrants have been assassinated for not attending to\r\nthe spirit and habits of their subjects.\r\n\r\nIn vain do rulers oppose the general opinion of the people. By such\r\nopposition, Philip IId, of Spain, kept one part of his subjects, for\r\nhalf a century, butchering the other, and in the end, lost one third of\r\nhis dominions. By not regarding the change of habits in the nation,\r\nCharles Ist, of England, lost his head. By carrying his changes too far,\r\nCromwell began to oppose the spirit of the nation, and had he lived to\r\nprosecute his system, that spirit would, in a few years, have brought\r\nhis neck to the block. The general spirit of the nation restored to the\r\nthrone, the son of the prince, whom that spirit had but a few years\r\nbefore arraigned and condemned. By opposing that spirit, James was\r\nobliged to leave his kingdom, and the sense of the nation still excludes\r\nthe family which, by their own law of succession, has the best title to\r\nthe throne. But there is no prescription against general opinion; no\r\nright that can enter the list against the sense of a nation; that sense,\r\nwhich after all our reasoning, will forever determin what is best.\r\n\r\nThe truth of these remarks is proved by examples in this country. An\r\nimmense revenue might have been drawn from America without resistance,\r\nin almost any method but that which the British parliament adopted. But\r\ntheir first attempts were made upon articles of common necessity; the\r\nattempts were too visible; the people felt and resisted. Their\r\napprehensions were alarmed; their fears, whether well founded or\r\nimaginary, were multiplied and confirmed by newspaper rhapsodies, and\r\nfinally produced a combined opposition to all British taxation. Then\r\nGreat Britain should have compounded; she did not; she opposed the\r\ngeneral sense of three millions of her subjects, and lost the whole.\r\n\r\nA dispute existed between Connecticut and Pensylvania, respecting a\r\ntract of land; a federal court decided the jurisdiction, or State claim,\r\nin favor of Pensylvania; five thousand inhabitants, seated on the lands,\r\nacknowlege the jurisdiction, but contend that their original purchase,\r\nand subsequent labor, entitle them to the lands. Notwithstanding the\r\ninvalidity of their State claim, the settlers determin to maintain their\r\nlands. The question of right is at once suspended, and the only inquiry\r\nis, which is the best policy, to indemnify a few individuals by a\r\npecuniary composition, or sacrifice five thousand subjects. This\r\nquestion, left to the commonwealth, would be decided by a great\r\nmajority, in favor of the settlers, and against the very principles of\r\nright on which the State holds the jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI am not competent to judge of the merits of the dispute between New\r\nYork and Vermont; but if the usurpation of Vermont were a conceded fact,\r\nand that usurpation to be defended by arms, and the question of granting\r\nthem independence were left to the State of New York, I am confident\r\nthat nine tenths of the people would decide for the independence of\r\nVermont against their own rights.\r\n\r\nThus it often happens, that a general opinion, grounded on rational\r\nexpediency, will, and ought to decide political questions, contrary to\r\nthe strict principles of justice and equity.\r\n\r\nI would, by no means, be understood to defend, by such doctrines, the\r\ninsurrections of a neighboring State. I reprobate every thing that wears\r\nthe least appearance of opposition to lawful authority. It is evident\r\nhowever, that the Legislature of Massachusetts were too inattentive to\r\nthe general spirit of the State. The murmurs of the people were heard\r\nlong before they broke out into rebellion, and were treated with too\r\nmuch neglect. They were a proof at least that something was wrong. This\r\nthe Legislature acknowleged in their late acts, and the complaints of\r\nthe populace might once have been silenced by such conciliatory\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nBut an opposition so violent must suddenly cease, or acquire system. In\r\nthe latter case, the demands of the insurgents will rise in proportion\r\nto their strength; they will ask unreasonable concessions, and the sword\r\nmust decide their claims. The insurgents took wrong steps to obtain\r\nredress; they should have rested their agrievances on petitions, and the\r\nevent of an election; but one rash step leads to a second, and to a\r\nthird. These fatal effects of popular discontent afford one useful\r\nlesson, that rulers should not attempt to carry a measure against the\r\ngeneral voice of a people.[35] But a question will arise, how far may\r\nthe people be opposed, when their schemes are evidently pernicious? I\r\nanswer, this can never happen thro design; and errors, even of the\r\npopulace, may gradually be removed. If the people cannot be convinced,\r\nby reason and argument, of the impolicy or injustice of a favorite\r\nscheme, we have only to wait for the consequences to produce conviction.\r\nAll people are not capable of just reasoning on the great scale of\r\npolitics; but all can feel the inconveniencies of wrong measures, and\r\nevils of this kind generally furnish their own remedy. All popular\r\nLegislatures are liable to great mistakes. Many of the acts of the\r\nAmerican Legislatures, respecting money and commerce, will, to future\r\ngenerations, appear incredible. After repeated experiments, people will\r\nbe better informed, and astonished that their fathers could make such\r\nblunders in legislation.\r\n\r\n    [35] Some have suspected from these sentiments, that I favor\r\n    the insurrection in Massachusetts. If it is necessary to be\r\n    more explicit than I have been in the declaration, \"_I\r\n    reprobate, &c._\" I must add, that in governments like ours,\r\n    derived from the people, I believe there is no _possible\r\n    situation_ in which violent opposition to laws can be\r\n    justified; because it can never be necessary. _General evils_\r\n    will always be legally redressed, and _partial evils_ must be\r\n    borne, if the majority require it. A tender law, which\r\n    interferes with _past_ contracts, is perhaps the wickedest\r\n    act that a Legislature can be guilty of; and yet I think the\r\n    people in Rhode Island have done right, in not opposing\r\n    their's, in a violent manner.\r\n\r\nIf the people of this State[36] are not already convinced, they\r\ncertainly will be, that the addition of 150,000l. of paper, to the\r\ncurrent specie of the State, did not increase the permanent value of\r\ncirculating medium a single farthing. They were perhaps told that such a\r\nsum of paper would shut up the specie, or enable the merchant to export\r\nit; but their jealousy made them believe these the suggestions of\r\ninterest; and nothing but the experiment could satisfy their wishes.\r\nEvery man of reflection must regret that he is subject to the evils\r\nconsequent on popular mistakes in judgement; but this is the price of\r\nour independence and our forms of government.\r\n\r\n    [36] Pensylvania.\r\n\r\nLet us attend to the immediate and necessary consequences of the\r\nAmerican revolution.\r\n\r\nSo great an event as that of detaching millions of people from their\r\nparent nation, could not have been effected without the operation of\r\npowerful causes. Nothing but a series of real or imaginary evils could\r\nhave shaken the habits by which we were governed, and produced a\r\ncombined opposition against the power of Great Britain. I shall not\r\nenumerate any of these evils; but observe that such evils, by twenty\r\nyears operation upon the fears or feelings of the Americans, had\r\nalienated their affections or weakened those habits of respect, by which\r\nthey were predisposed to voluntary obedience. When a government has lost\r\nrespect, it has lost the main pillar of its authority. Not even a\r\nmilitary force can supply the want of respect among subjects. A change\r\nof sentiment prepares the way for a change of government, and when that\r\nchange of sentiment had become general in America, nothing could have\r\nprevented a revolution.\r\n\r\nBut it is more easy to excite fears than to remove them. The jealousy\r\nraised in the minds of Americans against the British government, wrought\r\na revolution; but the spirit did not then subside; it changed its\r\nobject, and by the arts of designing men, and the real distresses\r\nconsequent on such a political storm, was directed against our own\r\ngovernments. The restraints imposed by respect and habits of obedience\r\nwere broken thro, and the licentious passions of men set afloat.\r\n\r\nNothing can be so fatal to morals and the peace of society, as a violent\r\nshock given to public opinion or fixed habits. Polemic disputes have\r\noften destroyed the friendship of a church, and filled it, not only with\r\nrancor, but with immorality. Public opinion therefore in religion and\r\ngovernment, the great supports of society, should never be suddenly\r\nunhinged. The separation of America, however, from all dependence on\r\nEuropean government, could not have been effected without previously\r\nattacking and changing opinion. It was an essential step, but the\r\neffects of it will not easily be repaired. That independence of spirit\r\nwhich preceded the commencement of hostilities, and which victory has\r\nstrengthened; that love of dominion, inherent in the mind of man, which\r\nour forms of government are continually flattering; that licentiousness\r\nof inquiry which a jealousy of rights first produced and still\r\npreserves, cannot be controled and subdued, but by a long series of\r\nprudent and vigorous measures.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the present age will hardly see the restoration of perfect\r\ntranquillity. But the spirit and principles, which wrought our\r\nseparation from Great Britain, will mostly die with the present\r\ngeneration; the next generation will probably have new habits of\r\nobedience to our new governments; and habits will govern them, with very\r\nlittle support from law.\r\n\r\nThe force of habit in government is most strikingly illustrated by the\r\nexample of Connecticut. Most of the laws, customs and institutions,\r\nwhich the people brought with them from England, or which they\r\nintroduced, on their first settlement, remain to this day, with such\r\nsmall alterations only as would naturally be made in the progress of\r\nsociety and population.\r\n\r\nThe government of Connecticut had formerly little more than a nominal\r\ndependence on England; independence therefore required but a little\r\nchange of the old constitution. The habits of the people have not been\r\nmaterially changed; their respect for the government has not been\r\nsuspended nor diminished. It would therefore be extremely difficult to\r\nraise an insurrection in that State against their own government;[37]\r\nfor they have not been accustomed to dispute the propriety of their\r\nestablished maxims and laws. Whatever alterations in their constitution,\r\na discerning Legislator might suggest, it would be highly impolitic to\r\nattempt any changes, which should disturb public opinion or alarm\r\napprehension. When a law or custom becomes inconvenient, the people will\r\nfeel the evil and apply a remedy.\r\n\r\n    [37] This assertion may seem to be contradicted by the\r\n    opposition of Connecticut to the half pay act; but that\r\n    opposition did not even threaten violence or arms: It was\r\n    conducted in a peaceable manner; and I do not know that the\r\n    State has furnished an instance of a tumultuous interruption\r\n    of law.\r\n\r\nMost of the other States had new constitutions of government to form;\r\nthey had a kind of interregnum; an interval, when respect for all\r\ngovernment was suspended; an interval fatal in the last degree, to\r\nmorals and social confidence. This interval between the abolition of the\r\nold constitution and the formation of a new one, lasted longer in\r\nMassachusetts than in the other States, and there the effects are most\r\nvisible. But perhaps it is impossible to frame a constitution of\r\ngovernment, in the closet, which will suit the people; for it is\r\nfrequent to find one, the most perfect in theory, the most objectionable\r\nin practice. Hence we often hear popular complaints against the present\r\ngovernments in America: And yet these may proceed rather from the\r\nnovelty of the obedience required, than from any real errors or defects\r\nin the systems: It may be nothing but the want of habit which makes\r\npeople uneasy; the same articles which now produce clamors and\r\ndiscontent, may, after twenty years practice, give perfect satisfaction.\r\nNay, the same civil regulation, which the present generation may raise a\r\nmob to resist, the next generation may raise a mob to defend.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps a more immediate and powerful cause of a corruption of\r\nsocial principles, is a fluctuation of money. Few people seem to attend\r\nto the connexion between money and morals; but it may doubtless be\r\nproved to the satisfaction of every reflecting mind, that a sudden\r\nincrease of specie in a country, and frequent and obvious changes of\r\nvalue, are more fruitful sources of corruption of morals than any events\r\nthat take place in a community.\r\n\r\nAmerica began the late war without funds of money, and its circulating\r\nspecie was very inconsiderable. Commerce was regular, and _speculation_,\r\na term unknown to the body of the people.\r\n\r\nThe emission of paper was an obvious and necessary expedient; yet it was\r\nbad policy to throw vast sums into circulation without taking some\r\nmeasures to recall it. It was the fate of America to receive in bills of\r\ncredit, and in the course of three or four years, about twenty times the\r\nnominal value of its current specie; the bills depreciated in the same\r\nproportion, and the real value of the medium continued the same.\r\n\r\nThe first visible effect of an augmentation of the medium and the\r\nconsequent fluctuation of value, was, a host of jockies, who followed a\r\nspecies of itinerant commerce; and subsisted upon the ignorance and\r\nhonesty of the country people; or in other words, upon the difference in\r\nthe value of the currency, in different places. Perhaps we may safely\r\nestimate, that not less than 20,000 men in America, left honest\r\ncallings, and applied themselves to this knavish traffic. A sudden\r\naugmentation of currency flattered people with the prospect of\r\naccumulating property without labor.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of too much money is to check manual labor, the only\r\npermanent source of wealth. Industry, which secures subsistence and\r\nadvances our interest by slow and regular gains, is the best\r\npreservative of morals; for it keeps men employed, and affords them few\r\nopportunities of taking unfair advantages. A regular commerce has nearly\r\nthe same effect as agriculture or the mechanic arts; for the principles\r\nare generally fixed and understood.\r\n\r\nSpeculation has the contrary effect. As its calculations for profit\r\ndepend on no fixed principles, but solely on the different value of\r\narticles in different parts of the country, or accidental and sudden\r\nvariations of value, it opens a field for the exercise of ingenuity in\r\ntaking advantage of these circumstances. The speculator may begin with\r\nhonest intentions; and may justify his business, by saying, that he\r\ninjures no man, when he givs the current value of an article in one\r\nplace, and sells it for its current value in another; altho in this case\r\nhe is a useless member of society, as he livs upon the labor of others,\r\nwithout earning a farthing. But he does not stop here; he takes an\r\nadvantage of ignorance and necessity; he will, if possible, monopolize\r\nan article to create a necessity. Repeated opportunities of this kind\r\ngradually weaken the force of moral obligation; and nine persons of ten,\r\nwho enter into the business of speculation with a good character, will,\r\nin a few years, lose their principles, and probably, their reputation.\r\n\r\nSpeculation is pernicious to morals, in proportion as its effects are\r\nextensiv. Speculation in the English funds is practised on principles\r\ndestructiv of justice and morals; but it consists in the transfer of\r\nlarge sums; the contingencies on which it depends are not frequent, and\r\nthe business is confined to a few sharpers in the metropolis. Such a\r\nspeculation affects not the body of the people. The medium circulating\r\nin the kingdom, has a fixed permanent value, and affords no\r\nopportunities for irregular gains.\r\n\r\nVery different is speculation in America. Here its objects are in every\r\nperson's hands; changes of value are frequent; opportunities of gain,\r\nnumberless; and the evil pervades the community. The country swarms with\r\nspeculators, who are searching all places, from the stores of the\r\nwealthy, to the recesses of indigence, for opportunities of making\r\nlucrativ bargains. Not a tavern can we enter, but we meet crowds of\r\nthese people, who wear their character in their countenances.\r\n\r\nBut the speculators are not the only men whose character and principles\r\nare exposed by such a state of the currency; the honest laborer and the\r\nregular merchant are often tempted to forsake the established principles\r\nof advance. Every temptation of this kind attacks the moral principles,\r\nand exposes men to small deviations from the rectitude of commutativ\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nSuch are the sources of corruption in commercial intercourse. A\r\nrelaxation of principle, in one instance, leads to every species of\r\nvice, and operates till its causes cease to exist, or till all the\r\nsupports of social confidence are subverted. It is remarked by people\r\nvery illiterate and circumscribed in their observation, that there is\r\nnot now the same confidence between man and man, which existed before\r\nthe war. It is doubtless true; this distrust of individuals, a general\r\ncorruption of manners, idleness, and all its train of fatal\r\nconsequences, may be resolved into two causes: The sudden flood of money\r\nduring the late war, and a constant fluctuation of the value of the\r\ncurrencies.\r\n\r\nThe effects of a sudden augmentation of the quantity of money in\r\ncirculation were so obvious, during the war, and the example is so\r\nrecent, that the subject requires no illustration, but a recollection of\r\nfacts. Yet there is an example recorded in the History of France, so\r\nexactly in point, that I cannot omit it.\r\n\r\nDuring the regency of the Duke of Orleans, one Law, who had fled from\r\npunishment in Scotland, and taken refuge in France, obtained, by his\r\naddress, a great share of confidence in the councils of the regent. He\r\nformed a plan of drawing all the specie from circulation, and issuing\r\nbills upon the royal treasury. It is not necessary to name the\r\nexpedients he used to effect his purpose. It is sufficient to observe,\r\nthat by various methods, he drew most of the specie of the kingdom into\r\nthe public treasury, and issued bills to about one hundred times the\r\nvalue of the specie, which had before circulated. The notes or\r\nsecurities depreciated as they were thrown into circulation, like our\r\ncontinental currency. The nature of a medium of trade, it seems, was not\r\nwell understood: Such a sudden depreciation was a surprising phenomenon\r\nat that period; men of property, who were the holders of the paper, were\r\nalarmed; the kingdom was in confusion. When the bills had sunk to a\r\nfifth of their value, a royal edict was issued, ordaining that the\r\nremaining specie in circulation should be sunk to a level with paper.\r\nThis resembles, in some respects, the regulation of prices in America.\r\nAn edict, so rash and absurd, increased the evils it was meant to\r\nremedy, and filled the kingdom with clamor.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, the paper was sunk as low as our continental currency,\r\nbefore its death.\r\n\r\nThe confusion was general; the regent and Law were obliged to fly the\r\nkingdom; and both died in obscurity, the one in Italy, and the other, if\r\nI mistake not, in the Netherlands. In France there was a total change of\r\nproperty; poor men made fortunes by speculation, and the rich were\r\nbeggared. The result of the whole was, that the paper was called in at a\r\ndiscount, by means similar to the _forty for one_ act of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBut the principal view I have in stating this example is, to show the\r\neffect of a sudden inundation of money upon industry and morals. No\r\nsooner did the nation feel an increase of the quantity of money, but the\r\nkingdom was overrun with speculators; men who left useful occupations,\r\nfor the prospect of rapid accumulations of wealth. Knavery, over\r\nreaching, idleness, prodigality, and every kind of vice prevailed, and\r\nfilled the kingdom with distress, confusion, and poverty.\r\n\r\nThe South Sea bubble, in England, was a farce of a similar kind, but its\r\neffects were less extensiv.\r\n\r\nThe continental currency was not the sole cause of the idleness and\r\nspeculation, which prevailed in this country, about the years 1780,\r\n1781, and 1782. Vast quantities of specie were introduced by the French\r\narmy, by the Spanish trade, and by a clandestine intercourse with the\r\nBritish garrisons. At the close of the war, there was more than double\r\nthe quantity of gold and silver in the country, which was necessary for\r\nthe purposes of a regular commerce.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary circulation of specie had its usual, its certain\r\neffect; it prompted multitudes to quit manual labor for trade. This\r\ncircumstance, in conjunction with the disbanding of the army, which left\r\ngreat numbers of men without employment, and with a rage for foreign\r\ngoods, which was always strong, and was then increased by a long war,\r\nfilled our commercial towns with hosts of adventurers in business. The\r\nconsequent influx of goods and enormous credit necessary to obtain them,\r\nare evils that deeply affect this country. I will not attempt a detail\r\nof the state of commerce in the United States; but observe that the\r\nnecessary exportation of specie was the happiest event that could befal\r\nthe United States; the only event that could turn industry into its\r\nproper channel, and reduce the commerce of the country to a proportion\r\nwith the agriculture.\r\n\r\nDissipation was another consequence of a flood of money. No country\r\nperhaps on earth can exhibit such a spirit of dissipation among men, who\r\nderive their support from business, as America. It is supposed by good\r\njudges, that the expenses of subsistence, dress and equipage, were\r\nnearly doubled in the commercial towns, the two first years of the\r\npeace. I have no doubt the support of the common people was enhanced\r\ntwenty five per cent. This augmentation of expenses, with a dimunition\r\nof productiv industry, are the consequences of too much money, and a\r\nscarcity is our only remedy.\r\n\r\nShort sighted people complain of the present scarcity; but it is the\r\nonly hope of our political salvation; and that Legislature which\r\nventures to remove popular complaints, by a coinage of great quantities\r\nof specie, or by its substitute, paper, checks industry, keeps alive a\r\nspirit of dissipation, and retards the increase of solid wealth. If this\r\nhas been necessary, it is a necessity sincerely to be lamented.\r\n\r\nBut there is one source of idleness and corruption, which is general in\r\nAmerica, and bids fair to be of long duration. I refer to the different\r\nspecies of federal and State securities, which are every where diffused,\r\nand of fluctuating value. These evidences of our debts open such\r\nprospects for rapid accumulations of property to every class of people,\r\nthat men cannot withstand the temptation: Thousands are drawn from\r\nuseful occupations into a course of life, which cannot possibly benefit\r\nsociety; which must render them useless, and probably will render them\r\nbad men, and dangerous members of a community.\r\n\r\nWhat remedy can be applied to so great an evil, it is not for me to\r\ndetermin. But if I may offer my sentiments freely, I must acknowlege\r\nthat I think no measure can produce so much mischief, as the circulation\r\nof a depreciated changeable currency. Let all our debts be placed on the\r\nfooting of bank stock, and made transferable only at the treasury; or\r\nlet the present evidences of it be called in, and new notes issued,\r\npayable only to the creditor or original holder; or let the securities\r\nbe purchased at their current discount, let some method be adopted to\r\ndraw them from circulation; for they destroy public and private\r\nconfidence; they cut the sinews of industry; they operate like a slow\r\npoison, dissolving the _stamina_ of government, moral principles.\r\n\r\nNo paper should circulate in a commercial country, which is not a\r\nrepresentativ of ready cash; it must at least command punctual interest,\r\nand security of the principal when demanded. Without these requisits,\r\nall notes will certainly depreciate. Most of our public securities want\r\nall the requisits of a paper currency. But if they did not; if they\r\nwere equal in value to bank notes or specie, still the sums are much too\r\nlarge for a circulating medium in America. The amount of the continental\r\nand State certificates, with the emissions of paper by particular\r\nStates, cannot be less than seventy millions of dollars, which is seven\r\ntimes the sum necessary for a circulation.\r\n\r\nWere they equal in value to gold and silver, the whole medium would\r\ndepreciate, specie as well as paper. But as they want every requisit of\r\na paper currency, the whole depreciation falls upon the securities.\r\n\r\nAn alarming consequence of the State of our public debt remains to be\r\nconsidered. Want of confidence in the public, added to the vast quantity\r\nof paper, has sunk it to a third, sixth, or eighth part of its nominal\r\nvalue. Most of the creditors of the public have parted with their\r\nsecurities at a great discount, and are thus robbed of the monies which\r\nthey earned by the sweat of the brow. Men of property have purchased\r\nthem for a trifle, and in some States receive the interest in specie. In\r\nMassachusetts, this is the case with respect to some part of the State\r\ndebt. When a man buys a note of twenty shillings value for five, and\r\nreceives the interest, six per cent. in specie, he in fact receives\r\ntwenty four per cent. on his money.\r\n\r\nThis is one source of the insurrection in Massachusetts. The people feel\r\nthe injustice of paying such an interest to men who earned but a small\r\npart of it, and whose sole merit is, that they have more money than\r\ntheir fellow citizens who suffer the loss by depreciation. Those men in\r\nparticular, who fought for our independence, or loaned their property to\r\nsave the country, view with indignant resentment, that law which obliges\r\nthem to pay twenty four per cent. interest on the securities, which they\r\nhave sold for a fourth, or an eighth part of their honest demands.\r\n\r\nThis cannot justify the violent steps taken by the people; because\r\npetitions, and united firmness in a constitutional way, would have\r\nprocured redress. But I state the facts to shew the effects of\r\nspeculation, or rather, of the want of faith in public engagements.\r\n\r\nSuch are the consequences of a variable medium; neglect to industry;\r\napplication to irregular commerce; relaxation of principles in social\r\nintercourse; distrust of individuals; loss of confidence in the public,\r\nand of respect for laws; innumerable acts of injustice between man and\r\nman, and between the State and the subject; popular uneasiness, murmurs\r\nand insurrections. And such effects will exist till their cause shall be\r\nremoved. Not the creation of a Supreme Power over the United States, is\r\nan object of more importance, than the annihilation of every species of\r\nfluctuating currency.\r\n\r\nThat instability of law, to which republics are prone, is another source\r\nof corruption. Multiplication and changes of law have a great effect in\r\nweakening the force of government, by preventing or destroying habits.\r\nLaw acquires force by a steady operation, and government acquires\r\ndignity and respect, in proportion to the uniformity of its proceedings.\r\nNecessity perhaps has made our federal and provincial governments\r\nfrequently shift their measures, and the unforeseen or unavoidable\r\nvariations of public securities, with the impossibility of commanding\r\nthe resources of the continent, to fulfil engagements, all predict a\r\ncontinuation of the evil. But the whole wisdom of Legislatures should be\r\nexerted to devise a system of measures which may preclude the necessity\r\nof changes that tend to bring government into contempt.\r\n\r\nA mild or lax execution of law may also have a bad effect in lessening\r\nthe respect for its officers. In a monarchy, there is no reasoning with\r\nthe executive; the will of the prince inspires terror. In our\r\ngovernments, the officers are often familiar, and will even delay\r\njustice as long as possible to assist the prisoner.\r\n\r\nIn some of the eastern States, the frequency and mildness of laws, have\r\nintroduced very singular habits. The people of Connecticut respect the\r\nlaws as much as any people; they would not be guilty of disobedience;\r\nthey mean generally to pay their debts, but are not very anxious to be\r\npunctual. They suppose a creditor can wait for his money longer than the\r\nperiod when it is due, and think it hard if he will not.[38]\r\n\r\n    [38] These remarks are not applicable to the mercantile part\r\n    of the people, who, since the revolution, have been\r\n    distinguished by their punctuality.\r\n\r\nThis mild execution of law, and a consequential habit of dilatoriness,\r\nwhich arise from the spirit of equality, are still prevalent amongst the\r\nbody of the people. These gave rise to the late incorporation of several\r\ncommercial towns, with large powers; an expedient which has answered the\r\npurpose of giving to commerce the advantage of energy and dispatch in\r\nthe collection of debts. As most of the business is done in the cities,\r\nthis effect will gradually extend itself, and form different habits.\r\n\r\nThe great misfortune of the multiplicity of laws and frequency of\r\nlitigation, is, that they weaken a respect for the executiv authority,\r\ndestroy the principle of honor, and transfer the disgrace, which ought\r\nto follow delinquency in payment, from a man's reputation, to the\r\nadministration of justice. The lawyers and courts are impeached, when\r\nthe whole blame ought to fall upon the debtor for his impunctuality.\r\nHonor, a substitute for honesty, has more influence upon men than law;\r\nfor in the one case, a man's character is at stake, and in the other,\r\nhis property. When a man's character suffers not, by a failure of\r\nengagements, and by a public prosecution, the collection of debts must\r\nbe slow. But when a man's reputation is suspended on the punctual\r\ndischarge of his contracts, he will spare no pains to do it; and this is\r\nor ought to be the case in all commercial countries.\r\n\r\nExtensiv credit, in a popular government, is always pernicious, and may\r\nbe fatal. When the people are deeply or generally involved, they have\r\npower and strong temptations to introduce an abolition of debts; an\r\nagrarian law, or that modern refinement on the Roman plan, which is a\r\nsubstitute for both, a paper currency, issued on depreciating\r\nprinciples. Rhode Island is a melancholy proof of this truth, and New\r\nHampshire narrowly escaped the deplorable evils. In governments like\r\nours, it is policy to make it the interest of people to be honest. In\r\nshort, the whole art of governing consists in binding each individual by\r\nhis particular interest, to promote the aggregate interest of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts affords a striking example of the danger incurred by too\r\nmany private debts. During the war the operation of justice was\r\nnecessarily suspended, and debts were constantly multiplying and\r\naccumulating. When law came to be rigorously enforced, the people were\r\ndistressed beyond measure, particularly in the western counties, where\r\npeople are poorer than in the parts of the State better settled, and\r\nnearer to market. These private debts crowded hard, and operated with\r\nthe demands of the federal creditors, to push the people into violent\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThe planters in Virginia owe immense sums of money to the British\r\nmerchants. What is the consequence? a law, suspending the collection of\r\nBritish debts. The loss of their slaves is the ostensible excuse for\r\nthis law; but a more solid reason must be, the utter impossibility of\r\nimmediately discharging the debts. In our governments the men who owe\r\nthe money, make the laws; and a general embarrassment of circumstances\r\nis too strong a temptation to evade or suspend the performance of\r\njustice. For this reason, the wisdom of the Legislature might cooperate\r\nwith the interest of the merchant, to check a general credit. In some\r\ncases it might be safe and wise to withdraw the protection of law from\r\ndebts of certain descriptions. It is an excellent law in one State,\r\nwhich ordains, that no tavern debt, of more than two days standing,\r\nshall be recoverable by law. It prevents tavern haunting and its\r\nconsequences, idleness, drunkenness and quarrels. Perhaps laws of this\r\nkind have the best effect in introducing punctual payments. Their first\r\neffect is to prevent credit; but they gradually change a man's regard\r\nfor his property, to a more activ and efficient principle, an attention\r\nto his character.\r\n\r\nIn the present anarchy in Massachusetts, monied men get credit with the\r\nmerchant, and are punctual to fulfil engagements, as they are sensible\r\nthat the merchant relies solely on their honor. The certain ultimate\r\ntendency of withdrawing the protection of law from particular kinds of\r\ndebts, is to discourage tricks and evasions, and introduce habits of\r\npunctuality in commerce.\r\n\r\nThe present state of our public credit hath the same effect. Repeated\r\nviolations of public faith, the circulation of a variable medium of\r\ntrade, the contempt of law, the perpetual fear of new legislativ schemes\r\nfor discharging our debts, and of tender laws, have made men very\r\ncautious in giving credit, and when they do give it, they depend more on\r\nthe honor of a man than on any security derived from law. This one happy\r\neffect of want of confidence in the public, is some small consolation\r\nfor an infinite variety of political evils and distresses.\r\n\r\nLaws to prevent credit would be beneficial to poor people. With respect\r\nto the contraction of debts, people at large, in some measure, resemble\r\nchildren; they are not judges even of their own interest. They\r\nanticipate their incomes, and very often, by miscalculation, much more\r\nthan their incomes. But this is not the worst effect; an easy credit\r\nthrows them off their guard in their expenses. In general we observe\r\nthat a slow, laborious acquisition of property, creates a caution in\r\nexpenditures, and gradually forms the miser. On the other hand, a sudden\r\nacquisition of money, either by gambling, lotteries, privateering, or\r\nmarriage, has a tendency to open the heart, or throw the man off his\r\nguard, and thus makes him prodigal in his expenses. Perhaps this is ever\r\nthe case, except when a penurious habit has been previously formed.\r\n\r\nAn easy and extensiv credit has a similar effect. When people can\r\npossess themselves of property without previous labor, they consume it\r\nwith improvident liberality. A prudent man will not; but a large\r\nproportion of mankind have not prudence and fortitude enough to resist\r\nthe demands of pride and appetite. Thus they often riot on other men's\r\nproperty, which they would not labor to procure. They form habits of\r\nindolence and extravagance, which ruin their families, and impoverish\r\ntheir creditors.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of extensiv credit, is a multitude of lawyers. Every\r\nthing which tends to create disputes, to multiply debts, weaken a regard\r\nto commercial engagements, and place the collection of debts on law,\r\nrather than on honour, increases the encouragement of lawyers. The\r\nprofession of law is honorable, and the professors, I scruple not to\r\naver, as liberal, honest and respectable, as any class of men in the\r\nState. But their business must be considered as a public evil, except in\r\nthe drafting of legal instruments, and in some real important disputes.\r\nSuch is the habit of trusting to law, for the recovery of debts, that,\r\nin some of the eastern States, one half or two thirds of the lawyers are\r\nmere collectors. They bring forward suits for small debts, that are not\r\ndisputed; they recover judgement upon default, they take out executions,\r\nand live upon their fees.\r\n\r\nThe evil is not so great in the middle States; but it is great in all\r\nthe States. Never was there such a rage for the study of law. From one\r\nend of the continent to the other, the students of this science are\r\nmultiplying without number. An infallible proof that the business is\r\nlucrativ.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents in Massachusetts enumerate lawyers among their\r\ngrievances. They wish the Legislature to limit their number and their\r\ndemands. Short sighted mortals! They seem not to consider that lawyers\r\ngrow out of their own follies, and that the only radical remedy for the\r\nevil is, to contract no more debts than they can pay, with strict\r\npunctuality.\r\n\r\nThe number of professional men in a State should be as few as possible;\r\nfor they do not increase the property of the State, but liv on the\r\nproperty acquired by others.\r\n\r\nThere is little danger that the number of clergymen will be too great.\r\nIn a few instances, religious parties may have multiplied their teachers\r\nto too great a number, and perhaps in some parts of the country, a few\r\nmore ministers of the gospel would be very useful.\r\n\r\nPhysicians will multiply in proportion to the luxuries and idleness of\r\nmen. They cannot be limited by law, for people will be as intemperate\r\nand as lazy as they please.\r\n\r\nBut an artful Legislature will take away some of the causes of\r\nlitigation, and thus curtail the number of lawyers. We may always\r\ndetermin the degree of corruption, in commercial habits, by the number\r\nof civil suits in the courts of law. The multiplication of lawyers is a\r\nproof of private embarrassments in any State; it is a convincing proof\r\nthat in America these embarrassments are numberless. The evil is of such\r\nmagnitude in _some_ States, as to suspend the operation of law, and in\r\n_all_ it produces distrust among men, renders property unsafe, and\r\nperplexes our mutual intercourse. In this situation, with popular\r\ngovernments, and an unbounded rage for magnificent living, perhaps the\r\nonly effectual remedy for a multitude of public evils, is the\r\nrestraining of credit. It might even be useful to destroy all credit on\r\nthe security of law, except debts of certain descriptions, where\r\nmortgages might be given. This would not check business, but it would\r\noblige people to exercise a principle of honor, and to have recourse to\r\nindustry, and ready payment for articles which their necessities or\r\ntheir fancies require. We should then be better able to determin,\r\nwhether bucks and bloods, in high life, \"who roll the thundering chariot\r\no'er the ground,\" are sporting with their own property, or that of\r\nhonest creditors.\r\n\r\nI cannot close these remarks without observing how much this country\r\nowes to particular classes of people for the practice of the commercial\r\nvirtues. To the Friends, the Germans and the Dutch, this country is\r\nindebted for that industry and provident economy, which enables them to\r\nsubsist without anxiety, and to be honest and punctual, without\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\nHappy would it be for this country, if these virtues were more generally\r\npractised. Paper money and foreign credit are mere temporary expedients\r\nto keep up the _appearance of wealth_ and splendor; but they are\r\nmiserable substitutes for solid property. The only way to become rich at\r\nhome and respectable abroad, is to become industrious, and to throw off\r\nour slavish dependence on foreign manners, which obliges us to sacrifice\r\nour opinions, our taste, and our interest, to the policy and\r\naggrandizement of other nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VIII.\r\n\r\nON PAPER MONEY.\r\n\r\n[Published at _Baltimore_, August 9, 1785.]\r\n\r\n\r\n          Messrs. PRINTERS,\r\n\r\nI observed a paragraph of intelligence in your Journal, of the 26th of\r\nJuly, respecting the circulation of paper currency in North Carolina. I\r\nam not disposed to dispute the truth of the fact, that paper currency\r\npasses in that State at par with specie; but I should be very sorry to\r\nsee it drawn into a precedent for other States.\r\n\r\n_The scarcity of cash_ is a general complaint, and superficial observers\r\nimpute the evil to a wrong cause, while shallow reasoners would remedy\r\nit by an emission of paper credit.\r\n\r\nThe real state of our commerce is this; since the ratification of peace,\r\nthe quantity of goods imported into the United States has been much\r\ngreater than what was necessary for the consumption of the inhabitants.\r\nPerhaps I shall not be wide of the truth, when I suppose that one third\r\nof the importations would supply the demands of people. The consequence\r\nis, the other two thirds continue on hand as a superfluity. The merchant\r\nfinds no market for his goods, and erroneously imputes the evil to a\r\nscarcity of cash. But the real truth is, people do not want his goods;\r\nthey purchase what they want, and find cash or produce to make payment;\r\nbut the surplus remains in store.\r\n\r\nIn every trading nation, there ought to be a due proportion between the\r\ncommercial interest, the agricultural and the manufacturing. Whenever\r\nthe farmers and manufacturers are too numerous for the merchants,\r\nproduce and manufactures will be plentiful and cheap; trade will of\r\ncourse be lucrativ. Whenever the merchants are too numerous for the\r\nlaborers, the importations of the former will exceed the wants of the\r\nlatter; of course goods will not find vent; and the merchant who owes\r\nnothing may lie and sleep in indolence, while the merchant who deals on\r\ncredit _must fail_. The experience of almost every day proves the _truth\r\nof this reasoning_. I will suppose that the number of merchants, and the\r\nquantity of goods in Baltimore, are double to what they were two years\r\nago; and the market for goods is nearly the same. The effect will be,\r\nthat the same profit of business will be divided among double the number\r\nof men, while, at the same time, rents and the price of provision in\r\nmarket will be double. The clear profit of the merchant will therefore\r\nbe reduced to one fourth part of what it was two years ago. I submit to\r\nthe inhabitants of this _flourishing_ town, whether this is a mere\r\nsupposition, or a moderate state of facts; and whether this reasoning\r\nwill not, in a greater or less degree, apply to every commercial town in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nBut is not money scarce? With respect to the quantity of goods in store,\r\n_money is very scarce_: With respect to the produce of the country,\r\nthere is _money enough_. Almost every article of home produce will\r\ncommand cash; but the merchant cannot get cash for his goods. Money is\r\nthe representativ of goods bought and sold. I will suppose, for the sake\r\nof argument, that two years ago there was cash enough in the country to\r\npurchase all the goods in market at the usual advance. I will suppose\r\nthat the quantity of goods has been trebled since that time. In this\r\ncase, had the quantity of money continued the same, there would have\r\nbeen cash enough to purchase just one third of the goods. But suppose\r\nwhat is true, that at the time the quantity of goods increases in this\r\nproportion, the quantity of money in circulation diminishes in the same\r\nproportion. In this case there will be but one third of the cash to\r\npurchase three times the goods. Thus but one sixth part of the goods can\r\nbe purchased by the circulating cash. The merchant must then lower the\r\nprice of his goods to one sixth of their value, or keep them on hand.\r\nThis reasoning, however mathematical, is just, and applies to all\r\ncommercial countries. It is a fair state of facts in America. But though\r\nthe quantity of money is greatly diminished, yet there is sufficient to\r\nrepresent the produce of the country, which in quantity continues the\r\nsame. The price is however lowered by the diminution of the quantity of\r\ncirculating cash.\r\n\r\nWhether the quantity of cash is diminished, and the quantity of goods\r\nincreased in the exact proportion above stated, is not material, the\r\nforegoing reasoning being sufficient to illustrate the principle. The\r\nprobability is, that the disproportion between the goods in market and\r\nthe cash in circulation, is greater than I have supposed.\r\n\r\nThe following propositions, I venture to assert, are generally, if not\r\nuniversally, true:\r\n\r\n1. That the imports of a country should never exceed its exports. In\r\nother words, the value of the goods imported should never exceed the\r\nvalue of the superfluous produce, or that part of the produce which the\r\ninhabitants do not want for their own consumption.\r\n\r\n2. That too great a quantity of cash in circulation, is a much greater\r\nevil than too small a quantity.\r\n\r\n3. That too much money in a commercial country will inevitably produce a\r\nscarcity.\r\n\r\n4. That the wealth of a country does not consist in cash, but in the\r\nproduce of industry, viz. in agriculture and manufactures.\r\n\r\n5. That in a commercial country, where people are industrious, there can\r\nnever be, for any long time, a want of cash sufficient for a medium.\r\n\r\nThe first proposition is universally acknowleged to be true.\r\n\r\nThe second is less obvious, but equally true. Too much money raises the\r\nprice of labor and of its effects; deprives us consequently of a foreign\r\nmarket; produces indolence and dissipation; than which greater evils\r\ncannot happen to a State. The sudden increase of money, by large\r\nemissions of paper credit, at the beginning of the late war, produced\r\nmore luxury, indolence, corruption of morals, and other fatal effects,\r\nthan all other causes that ever took place in America. We feel these\r\nevils to this moment. On the other hand, a scarcity of cash, tho it\r\ncramps commerce for a moment, always checks the evils before mentioned,\r\nlowers the price of labor, and produce will of course find a profitable\r\nmarket; it produces economy and industry, and consequently preserves the\r\nmorals of the people; for industry goes further in preserving purity of\r\nmorals, than all the sermons that were ever preached.\r\n\r\nThis leads to an illustration of the third proposition. If too much\r\nmoney in a country raises the price of labor and of produce, the\r\nconsequence is, that people will go abroad for articles, because they\r\nare cheaper in foreign markets, and they will purchase as long as they\r\ncan get cash. Importations will be multiplied till the country is\r\ndrained of cash, and then business will return to a new channel. The\r\nhistory of trade in America, the last two years, is an illustration of\r\nthis proposition.\r\n\r\nThe fourth proposition, also, is illustrated by facts. I will suppose\r\nthat ten millions of dollars are sufficient for a medium in America: Let\r\nthat sum be instantaneously augmented to twenty millions, and the\r\ncountry is not a farthing richer, for the price of goods will be\r\nimmediately doubled. _Two_ dollars, in the latter case, purchase no more\r\nthan _one_ in the former. People ignorantly suppose that goods rise in\r\nvalue; when the fact is, money falls in value. Continental currency was\r\na proof of this. There was cash enough for a medium in the country\r\nbefore the war; and the addition of two hundred millions of dollars did\r\nnot increase the wealth of the country one farthing; nor would the whole\r\npurchase more than the ten millions of specie which circulated before\r\nthe war. Had the paper all been Spanish milled dollars, the effect would\r\nhave been the same, had they continued in the country, and not been\r\nhoarded.\r\n\r\nThe fifth proposition depends on this simple fact, that money is a fluid\r\nin the commercial world, rolling from hand to hand wherever it is\r\nwanted, and there is any thing to purchase it. Let the produce of a\r\ncountry excel, in the least degree, the consumption, and it will never\r\nwant money.\r\n\r\nAdmitting the foregoing observations to be true, both the necessity and\r\npolicy of emitting paper, vanish at once. Supposing paper currency to\r\npreserve its credit, still so far from increasing the medium of trade,\r\nthat in a few months it will drive all the specie from the country. Bank\r\nnotes and bills of exchange are useful in facilitating a change or\r\nconveyance of property; but to issue paper credit, merely with a view to\r\nincrease the circulating medium, in a country where the people may have\r\njust as much gold and silver as they are pleased to work for, is the\r\nheight of folly. If people are indolent, or extravagant, all the paper\r\ncurrency under heaven will not make them rich, or supply their wants of\r\ncash. If people are industrious and frugal, and purchase no more foreign\r\ngoods than they can pay for in superfluous produce, they will ever have\r\ncash enough. Their whole system of commerce stands on these single\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nIf the merchants bring more goods than people want, business _must be\r\ndull_; money with them _must be scarce_. At the close of the war, cash\r\nwas plentiful and goods scarce. This made business lively, till people\r\nhad procured a supply. Remittances were made in cash, so long as it\r\ncould be obtained. That period is past, and the merchant must now look\r\nfor remittances where alone they ought ever to be found, in the produce\r\nof the country. Business is just now returning into its proper channel,\r\nfrom which it had been diverted by the violence of war, and the\r\nfluctuations of paper credit. The rapid population of a country is an\r\nagreeable circumstance; but every profession ought to increase in a due\r\nproportion. Supposing ten thousand carpenters were to land in Baltimore\r\nat once, would they have business? Or would they not exclaim, _business\r\nis dull_, _money is scarce_? Every one might have a trifle of business,\r\nbut they could not _all make fortunes_.\r\n\r\nAn event similar to this has taken place in Baltimore. The reputation\r\nfor business which Baltimore had acquired just at the close of the war,\r\nbrought merchants here from every part of the world, and almost one half\r\nof the town has been built within two years. How, in the name of common\r\nsense, do the merchants expect to find business? The people who come to\r\nthis market, multiply gradually, and double in about thirty years. But\r\nthe merchants who supply the goods have doubled, if not trebled, in\r\nnumbers and stock, within three years. There is, however, an expedient\r\nwhich will yet enable them all to liv by trade. Let every merchant send\r\nabroad to Ireland or Germany, and bring over his hundred able\r\nindustrious farmers, and fix them on the fertile lands of Maryland,\r\nwhich now lie useless and uncultivated in the hands of the Nabobs: Or\r\nlet three fourths of the traders quit the business. Either of these\r\nexpedients will make cash plentiful; and one of them must take place.\r\n\r\nI will just make one further remark; the want of a proper _union_ among\r\nthe States, will always render our commerce fluctuating and\r\nunprofitable. We may do as much business as we please; but if the duties\r\nand restrictions on our trade remain, and the flag of the United States\r\nis insulted as it has been, and each State is laying duties on the trade\r\nof its neighbor, our commerce cannot be reduced to a system, and our\r\nprofits must be uncertain. The want of a _Continental Power_ to guard\r\nthe honor of the whole body, and reduce our measures to one uniform\r\nsystem, is the great source of endless calamities. We shall feel\r\nnational abuse, till Congress are vested with powers sufficient to\r\n_govern_ and _protect_ us; and till that period, foreigners, like so\r\nmany harpies, will prey upon our commerce, and disappoint the exertions\r\nof our industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. IX.\r\n\r\n_On_ REDRESS _of_ GRIEVANCES.\r\n\r\n                         NEWBURY PORT, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy some resolves of the discontented people of this State,\r\n(Massachusetts) it appears that the true cause of public grievances is\r\nmistaken, and consequently the mode of redress will be mistaken. It is\r\nlaughable enough to hear the people gravely resolving, that the sitting\r\nof the general court at Boston is a grievance, when every body may\r\nrecollect that about twelve years ago, the removal of the Legislature to\r\nCambridge, was a grievance; an unconstitutional stretch of power, that\r\nthrew the province into a bustle. A great change, since Hutchinson's\r\ntime! Boston then was the only proper seat of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nLawyers, too, are squeezed into the catalogue of grievances. Why, sir,\r\nlawyers are a consequence; not a cause of public evils. They grow out of\r\nthe laziness, dilatoriness in payment of debts, breaches of contract,\r\nand other vices of the people; just as mushrooms grow out of dunghills\r\nafter a shower, or as distilleries spring out of the _taste_ for New\r\nEngland rum. The sober, industrious, frugal Dutch, in New York, and the\r\nQuakers and Germans in Pensylvania, have no occasion for lawyers; a\r\ncollector never calls upon them twice, and they feel no grievances.\r\nBefore the war, there was, in Orange county, New York, but one action of\r\ndebt tried in eighteen years. O happy people! happy times! no\r\ngrievances.\r\n\r\nMr. Printer, I saw a man the other day, carrying a bushel or two of\r\nflaxseed. Flaxseed is a cash article, and cash pays taxes. The man\r\nwanted cash to pay his taxes; he _must_ have cash; but, Mr. Printer,\r\nhalf an hour afterwards, I saw him half drunk, and his saddle bags\r\nfilled with coffee. But, sir, coffee pays no taxes.\r\n\r\nAnother, a few days ago, brought a lamb to market. Lambs command cash,\r\nand cash pays taxes; but the good countryman went to a store, and bought\r\na feather; five shillings for a feather, Mr. Printer, and feathers pay\r\nno taxes. Is it not a _grievance_, sir, that feathers and ribbands, and\r\ncoffee and new rum, will not pay taxes?\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Printer, in my humble opinion, there are but two effectual\r\nmethods of redressing grievances; one depends on the people as\r\nindividuals, and the other on the Supreme Executiv authority.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, let every person, whether farmer, mechanic, lawyer, or\r\ndoctor, provide a small box, (_a small box_ will be big enough) with a\r\nhole in the lid. When he receives a shilling, let him put six pence into\r\nthe box, and use the other six pence in providing for his family; not\r\nrum or feathers, but good bread and meat. Let this box remain untouched,\r\nuntil the collector shall call. Then let it be opened, the tax paid, and\r\nthe overplus of cash may be expended on gauze, ribbands, tea, and New\r\nEngland rum. Let the box then be put into its place again, to receive\r\npence for the next collector. This method, Mr. Printer, will redress all\r\ngrievances, without the trouble, noise and expense of town meetings,\r\nconventions and mobs.\r\n\r\nAs to the other method, sir, I can only say, were I at the head of the\r\nExecutiv authority, I should soon put the question to a decisiv issue.\r\nIt should be determined, on the first insurrection, whether our lives\r\nand our properties shall be secure under the law and the constitution of\r\nthe State, or whether they must depend on the mad resolves of illegal\r\nmeetings. Honest men then would know whether they may rest in safety at\r\nhome, or whether they must seek for tranquillity in some distant\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. X.\r\n\r\n_The_ DEVIL _is in you_.[39]\r\n\r\n    [39] Published in Rhode Island, shortly after the preceding\r\n    letter.\r\n\r\n                         PROVIDENCE, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the political body, like the animal, is liable to violent diseases,\r\nwhich, for a time, baffle the healing art, is a truth which we all\r\nacknowlege, and which most of us lament. But as most of the disorders,\r\nincident to the human frame, are the consequence of an intemperate\r\nindulgence of its appetites, or of neglecting the most obvious means of\r\nsafety; so most of the popular tumults, which disturb government, arise\r\nfrom an abuse of its blessings, or an inattention to its principles. A\r\nman of a robust constitution, relying on its strength, riots in\r\ngratifications which weaken the _stamina vitæ_; the surfeiting pleasures\r\nof a few years destroy the power of enjoyment; and the full fed\r\nvoloptuary feels a rapid transition to the meagre valetudinarian. Thus\r\npeople who enjoy an uncommon share of political privileges, often carry\r\ntheir freedom to licentiousness, and put it out of their power to enjoy\r\nsociety by destroying its support.\r\n\r\n_Too much health_ is a _disease_, which often requires a very strict\r\nregimen; _too much liberty_ is the worst of _tyranny_; and _wealth_ may\r\nbe accumulated to such a degree as to _impoverish_ a State. If _all_ men\r\nattempt to become _masters_, the _most_ of them would necessarily become\r\n_slaves_ in the attempt; and could _every man_ on earth possess millions\r\nof joes, _every man_ would be _poorer_ than _any man_ is now, and\r\ninfinitely more wretched, because they could not procure the necessaries\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, it is a common saying now, that _the devil is in you_. I\r\nquestion the influence of the devil, however, in these affairs. Divines\r\nand politicians agree in this, to father all evil upon the devil; but\r\nthe effects ascribed to this prince of evil spirits, both in the moral\r\nand political world, I ascribe to the wickedness and ignorance of the\r\nhuman heart. Taking the word _Devil_ in this sense, he is _in_ you, and\r\n_among_ you, in a variety of shapes.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the _weakness of our federal government is the\r\ndevil_. It prevents the adoption of any measures that are requisit for\r\nus, as a nation; it keeps us from paying our honest debts; it also\r\nthrows out of our power all the profits of commerce, and this drains us\r\nof cash. Is not this the devil? Yes, my countrymen, an empty purse is\r\nthe _devil_.\r\n\r\nYou say you are jealous of your rights, and dare not trust Congress.\r\nWell, that jealousy is an evil spirit, and all evil spirits are\r\n_devils_. So far the devil is in you. You act, in this particular, just\r\nlike the crew of a ship, who would not trust the helm with _one_ of\r\ntheir number, because he might _possibly_ run her ashore, when by\r\nleaving her without a pilot, they were _certain_ of shipwreck. You act\r\njust like men, who in raising a building, would not have a master\r\nworkman, because he _might_ give out wrong orders. You will be masters\r\nyourselves; and as you are not all ready to lift at the same time, one\r\nlabors at a stick of timber, then another, then a third; you are then\r\nvexed that it is not raised; why let a master order thirteen of you to\r\ntake hold together, and you will lift it at once. Every family has a\r\n_master_ (or a _mistress_--I beg the ladies' pardon.) When a ship or a\r\nhouse is to be built, there is a master; when highways are repairing,\r\nthere is a master; every little school has a master; the continent is a\r\ngreat school; the boys are numerous, and full of roguish tricks, and\r\nthere is no _master_. The boys in this great school play truant, and\r\nthere is no person to chastise them. Do you think, my countrymen, that\r\nAmerica is more easily governed than a school? You do very well in small\r\nmatters; extend your reason to great ones. Would you not laugh at a\r\nfarmer who would fasten a cable to a plough, and yet attempt to draw a\r\nhouse with a cobweb? \"And Nathan said unto David, _thou art the man_.\"\r\nYou think a master necessary to govern a _few_ harmless children in a\r\nschool or family; yet leave thousands of great rogues to be governed by\r\n_good advice_. Believe me, my friends, for I am _serious_; you _lose\r\nrights_, because you will not giv your magistrates authority to _protect\r\nthem_. Your liberty is despotism, because it has no control; your power\r\nis nothing, because it is not united.\r\n\r\nBut further, luxury rages among you, and luxury is _the devil_. The war\r\nhas sent this evil demon to impoverish people, and embarrass the public.\r\nThe articles of rum and tea alone, which are drank in this country,\r\nwould pay all its taxes. But when we add, sugar, coffee, feathers, and\r\nthe whole list of baubles and trinkets, what an enormous expense? No\r\nwonder you want paper currency. My countrymen are all grown very tasty!\r\nFeathers and jordans must all be imported! Certainly gentlemen, the\r\ndevil is among you. A Hampshire man, who drinks forty shillings worth of\r\nrum in a year, and never thinks of the expense, will raise a mob to\r\nreduce the governor's salary, which does not amount to three pence a man\r\nper annum. Is not this the devil?\r\n\r\nMy countrymen--A writer appeared, not long ago, informing you how to\r\nredress grievances.[40] He givs excellent advice. Let every man make a\r\nlittle box, and put into it _four pence_ every day. This in a year will\r\namount to six pounds one shilling and eight pence, a sum more than\r\nsufficient to pay any poor man's tax. Any man can pay three or four\r\npence a day, though no poor man can, at the end of a year, pay six\r\npounds. Take my advice, every man of you, and you will hardly feel your\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n    [40] See page 125.\r\n\r\nBut further, a _tender law_ is the _devil_. When I trust a man a sum of\r\nmoney, I expect he will return the full value. That Legislature which\r\nsays my debtor may pay me with _one third_ of the value he received,\r\ncommits a deliberate act of villany; an act for which an _individual_,\r\nin any government, would be honored with a whipping post, and in most\r\ngovernments, with a gallows. When a man makes dollars, one third of\r\nwhich only is silver, and passes them for good coin, he must lose his\r\nears, &c.\r\n\r\nBut Legislatures can, with the solemn face of rulers, and guardians of\r\njustice, boldly give currency to an _adulterated coin_, enjoin it upon\r\ndebtors to cheat their creditors, and enforce their systematic knavery\r\nwith legal penalties. The differences between the man who makes and\r\npasses counterfeit money, and the man who tenders his creditor one third\r\nof the value of the debt, and demands a discharge, is the same as\r\nbetween a thief and a robber. The first cheats his neighbor in the dark,\r\nand takes his property without his knowlege: The last boldly meets him\r\nat noon day, tells him he is a rascal, and demands his purse.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, the devil is among you. Make _paper_ as much as you\r\nplease; make it a tender in all _future contracts_, or let it rest on\r\nits own bottom: But remember that past contracts are _sacred things_;\r\nthat Legislatures have no right to interfere with them; they have no\r\nright to say, a debt shall be paid at a discount, or in any manner which\r\nthe parties never intended. It is the business of justice to fulfil the\r\nintention of parties in contracts, not to defeat them. To pay _bona\r\nfide_ contracts for cash, in paper of little value, or in old horses,\r\nwould be a dishonest attempt in an individual; but for Legislatures to\r\nframe laws to support and encourage such detestable villany, is like a\r\njudge who should inscribe the arms of a rogue over the feat of justice,\r\nor clergymen who should convert into bawdy-houses the temples of\r\nJehovah. My countrymen, the world says, the devil is in you: Mankind\r\ndetest you as they would a nest of robbers.\r\n\r\nBut lastly, mobs and conventions are devils. Good men love law and legal\r\nmeasures. Knaves only fear law, and try to destroy it. My countrymen, if\r\na constitutional Legislature cannot redress a grievance, a mob never\r\ncan. Laws are the security of life and property; nay, what is more, of\r\nliberty. The man who encourages a mob to prevent the operation of law,\r\nceases to be _free or safe_; for the same principle which leads a man to\r\nput a bayonet to the breast of a judge, will lead him to take property\r\nwhere he can find it; and when the judge dare not act, where is the\r\nloser's remedy? Alas, my friends, too much liberty is no liberty at all.\r\nGiv me any thing but mobs; for mobs are the devil in his worst shape. I\r\nwould shoot the leader of a mob, sooner than a midnight ruffian. People\r\nmay have grievances, perhaps, and no man would more readily hold up his\r\nhand to redress them than myself; but mobs rebel against laws of their\r\nown, and rebellion is a crime which admits of no palliation.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, I am a private, peaceable man. I have nothing to win or\r\nto lose by the game of paper currency; but _I revere justice_. I would\r\nsooner pick oakum all my life, than stain my reputation, or pay my\r\ncreditor one farthing less than his honest demands.\r\n\r\nWhile you attempt to trade to advantage, without a _head_ to combine all\r\nthe States into systematic, uniform measures, the world will laugh at\r\nyou for fools. While merchants take and giv credit, the world will call\r\nthem idiots, and laugh at their ruin. While farmers get credit, borrow\r\nmoney, and mortgage their farms, the world will call them fools, and\r\nlaugh at their embarrassments. While all men liv beyond their income,\r\nand are harrassed with duns and sheriffs, no man will pity them, or giv\r\nthem relief. But when mobs and conventions oppose the courts of justice,\r\nand Legislatures make paper or old horses a legal tender in all cases,\r\nthe world will exclaim with one voice--_Ye are rogues, and the devil is\r\nin you!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XI.\r\n\r\n                         NEW LONDON, OCTOBER, 1786.\r\n\r\nDESULTORY THOUGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo government has preserved more general and uninterrupted tranquillity\r\nfor a long period, than that of Connecticut. This is a strong proof of\r\nthe force of habit, and the danger that ever attends great alterations\r\nof government or a suspension of law. Every system of civil policy must\r\ntake its complexion from the spirit and manners of the people.\r\n\r\nWhatever political constitutions may be formed on paper, or in the\r\nphilosopher's closet, those only can be permanent which arise out of the\r\ngenius of the people.\r\n\r\nA jealous uneasy temper has sometimes appeared, among the people of this\r\nState; but as this has always proceeded from restless, ambitious men,\r\nwhose designs have been reprobated as soon as detected, this uneasiness\r\nhas always subsided without any violence to the Constitution. We do not\r\nadvert to the time when the course of law has been forcibly obstructed\r\nin Connecticut.\r\n\r\nIn the middle and southern States the corrupt English mode of elections\r\nhas been adopted: We see men meanly stoop to advertise for an office, or\r\nbeg the votes of their countrymen. In those States elections are often\r\nmere riots; almost always attended with disputes and bloody noses, and\r\nsometimes with greater violence. In Connecticut, a man never advertises\r\nfor an office, nor do we know that a man ever solicited a vote for\r\nhimself. We cannot name the election that produced a dispute, even in\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nIt belongs to the unprincipled of other States and countries to deride\r\nreligion and its preachers. It belongs to the coxcombs of courts, the\r\nproductions of dancing schools and playhouses, to ridicule our bashful\r\ndeportment and simplicity of manners. We revere the ancient institutions\r\nof schools and churches in this State. We revere the discipline which\r\nhas given such a mild complexion to the manners of its inhabitants, and\r\nsecured private satisfaction and public tranquillity.\r\n\r\n_Paper money_ is the present hobby horse of the States, and every State\r\nhas more or less of the _paper madness_. What a pity it is mankind will\r\nnot discern their right hands from their left. _Cash is scarce_, is the\r\ngeneral cry. Well, this proves nothing more than that the balance of\r\ntrade is against us, and that we eat, drink, and wear more foreign\r\ncommodities than we can pay for in produce: That is, we spend more than\r\nwe earn; or in other words, _we are poor_.\r\n\r\nBut nothing shows the folly of people more, than their attempts to\r\nremedy the evil by a _paper currency_. This is _ignorance_, it is\r\n_absurdity_ in the extreme. Do not people know that the addition of\r\nmillions and millions of money does not increase the value of a\r\ncirculating medium one farthing. Do they not know that the value of a\r\nmedium ought not to be increased beyond a certain ratio, even if it\r\ncould be? and that to increase the circulating cash of one State beyond\r\nthe circulating cash of other States, is a material injury to it. These\r\npropositions are as demonstrable as any problem in Euclid. Ten millions\r\nof dollars in specie were supposed to be the medium in America before\r\nthe war. Congress issued at first five millions in bills. As these came\r\n_into_ circulation, specie went _out_; consequently they held their\r\nnominal and real value on par, for the nominal value of the medium was\r\nnot much increased. Congress sent out another sum in bills; the nominal\r\nvalue of the medium was doubled, the bills sunk one half, and the real\r\nvalue of the medium remained the same. This was the subsequent progress;\r\nevery emission sunk the real value of bills, and two hundred millions of\r\ndollars were, in the end, worth just ten millions in specie, and no\r\nmore. Towards the close of the war, the specie in America was more than\r\ndoubled; it sunk to less than half its former value, and the paper\r\nbills sunk in the same proportion; from forty to eighty for one, nearly.\r\nWe had too much specie in the country, in the years 1782 and 1783; it\r\nruined hundreds of merchants, and injured the community.\r\n\r\nBut it is said, we want a circulating medium. This is not true; we have\r\ntoo much in circulation. The specie and paper now circulating in\r\nAmerica, amounts to fifty or sixty millions of dollars; whereas we want\r\nnot more than ten or fifteen millions. The paper is therefore sunk in\r\nreal value, so as to reduce the real value of the whole medium to that\r\nsum which is wanted. We may make millions of paper if we please; but we\r\nshall not add one farthing to the property of the State. Money is not\r\nwealth in a State, but the representativ of wealth. A paper currency may\r\nanswer a temporary purpose of enabling people to pay debts; but it is\r\nnot an advantage even to the debtor, unless it is depreciated; and in\r\nthis case it is an injury to the creditor. If the paper retains its\r\nvalue, the debtor must sooner or later purchase it with the produce of\r\nhis labor; and if it depreciates, it is the tool of knaves while it\r\ncirculates; it ruins thousands of honest unsuspecting people; it gives\r\nthe game to the idle speculator, who is a nuisance to the State; it\r\nstabs public credit and private confidence; and what is worse than all,\r\nit unhinges the obligations which unite mankind. A fluctuation of medium\r\nin a State makes more fatal ravages among the morals of people, than a\r\npestilence among their lives. O America! happy would it have been for\r\nthy peace, thy morals, thy industry, if, instead of a depreciation of\r\npaper bills and securities, stamped with public faith, millions of\r\ninfernal spirits had been let loose among thy inhabitants! Never, never\r\nwilt thou experience the return of industry, economy, private confidence\r\nand public content, till every species of depreciated and fluctuating\r\nmedium shall be annihilated; till Legislatures learn to revere justice,\r\nand dread a breach of faith more than the vengeance of vindictiv\r\nheaven!\r\n\r\nAmericans! you talk of a scarcity of cash. Well, the only remedy is, to\r\nenable Congress to place our commerce on a footing with the trade of\r\nother nations. Foreign States have nothing to do with Massachusetts or\r\nNew York. They must make treaties with _United America_, or not make\r\nthem at all. And while we boast of the independence of particular\r\nStates, we lose all the benefits of independence. For fear that Congress\r\nwould abuse their powers and enrich themselves, we, like the dog in the\r\nmanger, will not even enrich ourselves. We complain of poverty, and yet\r\n_giv_ the profits of our trade to foreign nations. Infatuated men! We\r\nhave one truth to learn--_That nothing but the absolute power of\r\nregulating our commerce, vested in some federal head_, can ever restore\r\nto us cash, or turn the balance of trade in our favor. New York alone,\r\nby its advantageous situation, is growing rich upon the spoils of her\r\nneighbors, and impoverishing the continent to fill her own treasury.\r\n\r\nLawyers, you say, O deluded Americans! are an evil. Will you always be\r\nfools? Why lawyers are as good men as others: I venture to say further,\r\nthat lawyers in this country have devised and brought about the wisest\r\npublic measures that any State has adopted. My countrymen, the expense\r\nof supporting a hundred lawyers is a very great and a very needless\r\nexpense. You pay to lawyers and courts every year thirty or forty\r\nthousand pounds. A great expense, indeed! But courts and lawyers are not\r\nto be blamed. The people are the cause of the evil, and they alone, as\r\nindividuals, are able to remedy it. And yet the remedy is very simple.\r\n_Cease to run in debt_, or _pay your debts punctually_; then lawyers\r\nwill cease to exist, and court houses will be shut. If you wish or\r\nexpect any other remedy than this, you certainly will be disappointed. A\r\nman, who purposely rushes down a precipice and breaks his arm, has no\r\nright to say, that surgeons are an evil in society. A Legislature may\r\nunjustly limit the surgeon's fee; but the broken arm must be healed, and\r\na surgeon is the only man to do it.\r\n\r\nMy friends, learn wisdom. You are peaceable yet, and let the\r\ndistractions of your neighbors teach you to preserve your tranquillity.\r\n\r\nSpend less money than you earn, and you will every day grow richer.\r\nNever run in debt, and lawyers will become farmers. Never make paper\r\nmoney, and you will not cheat your citizens, nor have it to redeem.\r\nAbove all, pay your public debts, for independence and the confederation\r\nrequire it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XII.\r\n\r\n                         NEW HAVEN, DECEMBER, 1786.\r\n\r\nADVICE _to_ CONNECTICUT FOLKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n          MY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nTimes are hard; money is scarce; taxes are high, and private debts push\r\nus. What shall we do? Why, hear a few facts, stubborn facts, and then\r\ntake a bit of advice.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1637, our good forefathers declared an offensiv war against\r\nthe Pequot Indians. Their troops were ninety men. Weathersfield was\r\nordered to furnish a hog for this army, Windsor a ram goat, and Hartford\r\na hogshead of beer, and four or five gallons of strong water.[41]\r\n\r\n    [41] See the records of this State, where rum is called\r\n    strong water. This was soon after the first distilling of\r\n    spirits, and rum was not then named. It seems, however, that\r\n    our pious ancestors had a taste for it, which their posterity\r\n    have carefully improved.\r\n\r\nThis was ancient simplicity! Let us make a little estimation of the\r\nexpenses annually incurred in Connecticut. (I say incurred, for we can\r\ncontract debts, though we cannot pay them.)\r\n\r\nI will just make a distinction between necessary and unnecessary\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\n                                               Necessary.

I will tell you how\r\nto pay your taxes and debts, without feeling them.\r\n\r\n1st. Fee no lawyers.\r\n\r\nYou say lawyers have too high fees. I say they have not. They cost me\r\nnot one farthing. Do as I have always done, and lawyers' fees will be no\r\ntrouble at all. If I want a new coat, or my wife wants a new gown, we\r\nhave agreed to wear the old ones until we have got cash or produce to\r\npay for them. When we buy, we pay in hand; we get things cheaper than\r\nour neighbors; merchants never dun us, and we have no lawyers' fees to\r\npay. When we see sheriffs and duns knocking at the doors of our\r\nneighbors, we laugh at their folly. Besides, I keep a little drawer in\r\nmy desk, with money enough in it to pay the next tax; and I never touch\r\na farthing until the collector calls. Now, good folks, if you will take\r\nthe same method, you will save out of lawyers' fees and court charges,\r\non the most moderate calculations, 20,000l. a year.\r\n\r\n2dly. I allow my family but two gallons of rum a year. This is enough\r\nfor any family, and too much for most of them. I drink cyder and beer of\r\nmy own manufacture; and my wife makes excellent beer, I assure you. I\r\nadvise you all to do the same. I am astonished at you, good folks. Not a\r\nmechanic or a laborer goes to work for a merchant, but he carries home a\r\nbottle of rum. Not a load of wood comes to town, but a gallon bottle is\r\ntied to the cart stake to be filled with rum. Scarcely a woman comes to\r\ntown with tow cloth, but she has a wooden gallon bottle in one side of\r\nher saddle bags, to fill with rum. A stranger would think you to be a\r\nnation of Indians by your thirst for this paltry liquor. Take a bit of\r\nadvice from a good friend of yours. Get two gallons of rum in a year;\r\nhave two or three frolics of innocent mirth; keep a little spirit for a\r\nmedicine, and let your common drink be the produce or manufacture of\r\nthis country. This will make a saving of almost 400,000 gallons of rum,\r\nor 80,000l. a year.\r\n\r\n3dly. Never buy any useless clothing.\r\n\r\nKeep a good suit for Sundays and other public days; but let your common\r\nwearing apparel be good substantial cloths, and linens of your own\r\nmanufacture. Let your wives and daughters lay aside their plumes.\r\nFeathers and fripperies suit the Cherokees or the wench in your kitchen;\r\nbut they little become the fair daughters of America.[42] Out of the dry\r\ngoods imported, you may save 50,000l. a year.\r\n\r\n    [42] I would just mention to my fair readers, whom I love and\r\n    esteem, that feathers and other frippery of the head, are\r\n    disreputable in Europe.\r\n\r\nThese savings amount to 150,000l. a year. This is more than enough to\r\npay the interest of all our public debts.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, I am not trifling with you: I am serious. You feel the\r\nfacts I state; you know you are poor, and ought to know, the fault is\r\nall your own. Are you not satisfied with the food and drink which this\r\ncountry affords? The beef, the pork, the wheat, the corn, the butter,\r\nthe cheese, the cyder, the beer, those luxuries which are heaped in\r\nprofusion upon your tables? If not, you must expect to be poor. In vain\r\ndo you wish for mines of gold and silver. A mine would be the greatest\r\ncurse that could befal this country. There is gold and silver enough in\r\nthe world, and if you have not enough of it, it is because you consume\r\nall you earn in useless food and drink. In vain do you wish to increase\r\nthe quantity of cash by a mint, or by paper emissions. Should it rain\r\nmillions of joes into your chimnies, on your present system of expenses,\r\nyou would still have no money. It would leave the country in streams.\r\nTrifle not with serious subjects, nor spend your breath in empty wishes.\r\nReform; economize. This is the whole of your political duty. You may\r\nreason, speculate, complain, raise mobs, spend life in railing at\r\nCongress and your rulers; but unless you import less than you export,\r\nunless you spend less than you earn, you will eternally be poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XIII.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, DECEMBER, 1787.\r\n\r\n_To the_ DISSENTING MEMBERS _of the late_ CONVENTION _of_ PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n          GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nYour long and elaborate publication, assigning the reasons for your\r\nrefusing to subscribe the ratification of the _new Federal\r\nConstitution_, has made its appearance in the public papers, and, I\r\nflatter myself, will be read throughout the United States. It will feed\r\nthe flame of opposition among the weak, the wicked, the designing, and\r\nthe factious; but it will make many new converts to the proposed\r\ngovernment, and furnish the old friends of it with new weapons of\r\ndefence. The very attempt to excite uneasiness and disturbance in a\r\nState, about a measure legally and constitutionally adopted, after a\r\nlong and ample discussion in a convention of the people's delegates,\r\nwill create suspicions of the goodness of your cause. My address to you\r\nwill not be so lengthy as your publication; your arguments are _few_,\r\naltho your harangue is _long_ and _insidious_.\r\n\r\nYou begin with telling the world, that _no defect was discovered in the\r\npresent confederation, till after the war_. Why did you not publish the\r\ntruth? You know, gentlemen, that during six years of the war, we had _no\r\nconfederation at all_. You know that the war commenced in April, 1775,\r\nand that we had _no confederation_ till March, 1781. You know (for some\r\nof you are men of abilities and reading) or ought to know, a principle\r\nof _fear_, in time of war, operates more powerfully in binding together\r\nthe States which have a common interest, than all the parchment compacts\r\non earth. Could we, then, discover the defects of our present\r\nconfederation, with _two years'_ experience only, and an enemy in our\r\ncountry? You know we could not.\r\n\r\nI will not undertake to detect the falsehood of every assertion, or the\r\nfallacy of all your reasoning on each article. In the most of them the\r\npublic will anticipate any thing I could say, and confute your arguments\r\nas fast as they read them. But, gentlemen, your reasoning against the\r\n_new Constitution_ resembles that of Mr. Hume on miracles. You begin\r\nwith some _gratis dicta_, which are denied; you assume _premises_ which\r\nare _totally false_, and then reason on them with great address. Your\r\nwhole reasoning, and that of all the opposers of the federal government,\r\nis built on this _false principle_, that the _federal Legislature_ will\r\nbe a body _distinct from_ and _independent of_ the people. Unless your\r\nopposition is grounded on _that principle_, it stands on _nothing_; and\r\non any _other_ supposition, your arguments are but _declamatory\r\nnonsense_.\r\n\r\nBut the principle is false. The Congress, under the proposed\r\nconstitution, will have the _same interest_ as the people; they are _a\r\npart_ of the people; their interest is _inseparable_ from that of the\r\npeople; and this union of interest will eternally remain, while the\r\nright of election shall continue in the people. Over this right Congress\r\nwill have no control: The time and manner of exercising that right are\r\nvery wisely vested in Congress; otherwise a delinquent State might\r\nembarrass the measures of the Union. The safety of the public requires\r\nthat the federal body should prevent any particular delinquency; but the\r\n_right of election_ is above their control; it _must_ remain in the\r\npeople, and be exercised once in two, four or six years. A body thus\r\norganized, with thirteen Legislatures watching their measures, and\r\nseveral millions of jealous eyes inspecting their conduct, would not be\r\napt to betray their constituents. Yet this is not the best ground of\r\nsafety. The first and almost only principle that governs men, is\r\n_interest_. _Love of our country_ is a powerful auxiliary motiv to\r\npatriotic actions; but rarely or never operates against _private\r\ninterest_. The only requisit to secure liberty, is to connect the\r\n_interest_ of the _governors_ with that of the _governed_. Blend these\r\ninterests; make them inseparable, and both are safe from voluntary\r\ninvasion. How shall this union be formed? This question is answered. The\r\nunion is formed by the equal principles on which the people of these\r\nStates hold their property and their rights. But how shall this union of\r\ninterests be perpetuated? The answer is easy; bar all perpetuities of\r\nestates; prevent any exclusiv rights; preserve all preferment dependent\r\non the choice of the people; suffer no power to exist independent on the\r\npeople or their representativs. While there exists no power in a State,\r\nwhich is independent of the will of the electors, the rights of the\r\npeople are secure. The only barrier against tyranny, that is necessary\r\nin any State, is _the election of legislators_ by the yeomanry of that\r\nState. Preserve _that_, and every privilege is safe. The legislators\r\nthus chosen to represent the people, should have all the power that the\r\npeople would have, were they assembled in one body to deliberate upon\r\npublic measures. The distinction between the powers of the _people_ and\r\nof their _representativs_ in the Legislature, is as absurd in _theory_,\r\nas it proves pernicious in _practice_. A distinction, which has already\r\ncountenanced and supported _one rebellion_ in America; has prevented\r\nmany _good_ measures; has produced many _bad_; has created animosities\r\nin many States, and embarrassments in all.[43] It has taught the people\r\na lesson, which, if they continue to practise, will bring laws into\r\ncontempt, and frequently mark our country with blood.\r\n\r\n    [43] Some of the bills of rights in America declare, that the\r\n    people have a right to meet together, and consult for the\r\n    public safety; that their legislators are responsible to\r\n    them; that they are servants, &c. Such declarations give\r\n    people an idea, that as individuals, or in town meetings,\r\n    they have a power paramount to that of the Legislature. No\r\n    wonder, that with such ideas, they attempt to resist law.\r\n\r\nYou object, gentlemen, to the powers vested in Congress. Permit me, to\r\nask you, where will you limit their powers? What bounds will you\r\nprescribe? You will reply--_we will reserve certain rights, which we\r\ndeem invaluable, and restrain our rulers from abridging them_. But,\r\ngentlemen, let me ask you, how will you define these rights? would you\r\nsay, _the liberty of the press shall not be restrained_? Well, what is\r\nthis liberty of the press? Is it an unlimited licence to publish _any\r\nthing and every thing_ with impunity? If so, the author and printer of\r\nany treatise, however obscene and blasphemous, will be screened from\r\npunishment. You know, gentlemen, that there are books extant, so\r\nshockingly and infamously obscene and so daringly blasphemous, that no\r\nsociety on earth would be vindicable in suffering the publishers to pass\r\nunpunished. You certainly know that such cases _have_ happened, and\r\n_may_ happen again: Nay, you know that they are _probable_. Would not\r\nthat indefinite expression, _the liberty of the press_, extend to the\r\njustification of every _possible publication_? Yes, gentlemen, you know,\r\nthat under such a general license, a man who should publish a treatise\r\nto _prove his Maker a knave_, must be screened from legal punishment. I\r\nshudder at the thought! But the truth must not be concealed. The\r\nconstitutions of several States _guarantee that very license_.\r\n\r\nBut if you attempt to define the _liberty of the press_, and ascertain\r\nwhat cases shall fall within that privilege, during the course of\r\ncenturies, where will you _begin_? Or rather, where will you _end_?\r\nHere, gentlemen, you will be puzzled. Some publications certainly _may_\r\nbe a breach of civil law: You will not have the effrontery to deny a\r\ntruth so obvious and intuitivly evident. Admit that principle; and\r\nunless you can define precisely the cases, which are, and are not a\r\nbreach of law, you have no right to say, the liberty of the press shall\r\nnot be restrained; for such a license would warrant _any breach of law_.\r\nRather than hazard such an abuse of privilege, is it not better to leave\r\nthe right altogether with your rulers and your posterity? No attempts\r\nhave ever been made by a legislativ body in America, to abridge that\r\nprivilege; and in this free enlightened country, no attempts could\r\nsucceed, unless the public should be convinced that an abuse of it would\r\nwarrant the restriction. Should this ever be the case, you have no right\r\nto say, that a future Legislature, or that posterity shall not abridge\r\nthe privilege, or punish its abuses.\r\n\r\nBut you say, that trial by jury is an unalienable right, that ought not\r\nto be trusted with our rulers. Why not? If it is such a darling\r\nprivilege, will not Congress be as fond of it, as their constituents? An\r\nelevation into that council, does not render a man insensible to his\r\nprivileges, nor place him beyond the necessity of securing them. A\r\nmember of Congress is liable to all the operations of law, except during\r\nhis attendance on public business; and should he consent to a law,\r\nannihilating any right whatever, he deprives himself, his family and\r\nestate, of the benefit resulting from that right, as well as his\r\nconstituents. This circumstance alone, is a sufficient security.\r\n\r\nBut, why this outcry about juries? If the people esteem them so highly,\r\nwhy do they ever neglect them, and suffer the trial by them to go into\r\ndisuse? In some States, _Courts of Admiralty_ have no juries, nor Courts\r\nof Chancery at all. In the City Courts of some States, juries are rarely\r\nor never called, altho the parties may demand them; and one State, at\r\nleast, has lately passed an act, empowering the parties to submit both\r\n_law_ and _fact_ to the court. It is found, that the judgment of a court\r\ngives as much satisfaction, as the verdict of a jury; for the court are\r\nas good judges of fact, as juries, and much better judges of law. I have\r\nno desire to abolish trials by jury, altho the original design and\r\nexcellence of them, is in many cases superseded. While the people remain\r\nattached to this mode of deciding causes, I am confident, that no\r\nCongress can wrest the privilege from them.\r\n\r\nBut, gentlemen, our legal proceedings want a reform. Involved in all the\r\nmazes of perplexity, which the chicanery of lawyers could invent, in the\r\ncourse of five hundred years, our road to justice and redressis\r\ntedious, fatiguing and expensiv. Our judicial proceedings are capable of\r\nbeing simplified, and improved in almost every particular. For mercy's\r\nsake, gentlemen, do not shut the door against improvement. If the people\r\nof America, should ever spurn the shackles of opinion, and venture to\r\nleave the road, which is so overgrown with briers and thorns, as to\r\nstrip a man's clothes from his back as he passes, I am certain they can\r\ndevise a more easy, safe, and expeditious mode of administering the\r\nlaws, than that which harasses every poor mortal, that is wretched\r\nenough to want _legal_ justice. In States where very respectable\r\nmerchants, have repeatedly told me, they had rather lose a debt of fifty\r\npounds, than attempt to recover it by a legal process, one would think\r\nthat men, who value liberty and property, would not restrain any\r\ngovernment from suggesting a remedy for such disorders.\r\n\r\nAnother right, which you would place beyond the reach of Congress, is\r\nthe writ of _habeas corpus_. Will you say that this right may not be\r\nsuspended in _any_ case? You dare not. If it may be suspended in any\r\ncase, and the Congress are to judge of the necessity, what security have\r\nyou in a declaration in its favor? You had much better say nothing upon\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nBut you are frightened at a standing army. I beg you, gentlemen, to\r\ndefine a _standing army_. If you would refuse to giv Congress power to\r\nraise troops, to guard our frontiers, and garrison forts, or in short,\r\nto enlist men for any purpose, then we understand you; you tie the hands\r\nof your rulers, so that they cannot defend you against any invasion.\r\nThis is protection, indeed! But if Congress can raise a body of troops\r\nfor a year, they can raise them for a _hundred years_, and your\r\ndeclaration against _standing armies_ can have no other effect, than to\r\nprevent Congress from denominating their troops, a _standing army_. You\r\nwould only introduce into this country the English farce of mechanically\r\npassing an annual bill for the support of troops which are never\r\ndisbanded.\r\n\r\nYou object to the indefinite power of taxation in Congress. You must\r\nthen limit the exercise of that power by the sums of money to be raised;\r\nor leaving the sums indefinite, must prescribe the _particular mode_ in\r\nwhich, and the _articles_ on which the money is to be raised. But the\r\nsums cannot be ascertained, because the necessities of the States cannot\r\nbe foreseen nor defined. It is beyond even _your_ wisdom and profound\r\nknowlege, gentlemen, to ascertain the public exigencies, and reduce them\r\nto the provisions of a constitution. And if you would prescribe the mode\r\nof raising money, you will meet with equal difficulty. The different\r\nStates have different modes of taxation, and I question much whether\r\neven _your_ skill, gentlemen, could invent a uniform system that would\r\nfit easy upon every State. It must therefore be left to experiment, with\r\na power that can correct the errors of a system, and suit it to the\r\nhabits of the people. And if no uniform mode will answer this purpose,\r\nit will be in the power of Congress to lay taxes in each State,\r\naccording to its particular practice.\r\n\r\nYou know that requisitions on the States are ineffectual; that they\r\ncannot be rendered effectual, but by a compulsory power in Congress;\r\nthat without an efficient power to raise money, government cannot secure\r\nperson, property or justice; that such power is as safely lodged in your\r\n_Representativs_ in Congress, as it is in your _Representativs_ in your\r\ndistinct Legislatures.\r\n\r\nYou would likewise restrain Congress from requiring _excessiv bail_ or\r\nimposing _excessiv fines_ and _unusual punishment_. But unless you can,\r\nin every possible instance, previously define the words _excessiv_ and\r\n_unusual_; if you leave the discretion of Congress to define them on\r\noccasion, any restriction of their power by a general indefinit\r\nexpression, is a nullity--mere _formal nonsense_. What consummate\r\narrogance must you possess, to presume you can _now_ make _better_\r\nprovision for the government of these States, during the course of ages\r\nand centuries, than the future Legislatures can, on the spur of the\r\noccasion! Yet your whole reasoning on the subject implies this\r\narrogance, and a presumption that you have a right to legislate for\r\nposterity!\r\n\r\nBut to complete the list of unalienable rights, you would insert a\r\nclause in your declaration, _that every body shall, in good weather,\r\nhunt on his own land, and catch fish in rivers that are public\r\nproperty_. Here, gentlemen, you must have exerted the whole force of\r\nyour genius! Not even the _all important_ subject of _legislating for a\r\nworld_, can restrain my laughter at this clause! As a supplement to that\r\narticle of your bill of rights, I would suggest the following\r\nrestriction:--\"That Congress shall never restrain any inhabitant of\r\nAmerica from eating and drinking, _at seasonable times_, or prevent his\r\nlying on his _left side_, in a long winter's night, or even on his back,\r\nwhen he is fatigued by lying on his _right_.\" This article is of just as\r\nmuch consequence as the eighth clause of your proposed bill of rights.\r\n\r\nBut to be more serious, gentlemen, you must have had in idea the forest\r\nlaws in Europe, when you inserted that article; for no circumstance that\r\never took place in America, could have suggested the thought of a\r\ndeclaration in favor of hunting and fishing. Will you forever persist in\r\nerror? Do you not reflect that the state of property in America, is\r\ndirectly the reverse of what it is in Europe? Do you not consider, that\r\nthe forest laws in Europe originated in _feudal tyranny_, of which not a\r\ntrace is to be found in America? Do you not know that in this country\r\nalmost every farmer is lord of his own soil? That instead of suffering\r\nunder the oppression of a monarch and nobles, a class of haughty\r\nmasters, totally independent of the people, almost every man in America\r\nis a _lord himself_, enjoying his property in fee? Where then the\r\nnecessity of laws to secure hunting and fishing? You may just as well\r\nask for a clause, giving license for every man to till _his own land_,\r\nor milk _his own cows_. The barons in Europe procured forest laws to\r\nsecure the right of hunting on _their own land_, from the intrusion of\r\nthose who had no property in lands. But the distribution of land in\r\nAmerica, not only supersedes the necessity of any laws upon this\r\nsubject, but renders them absolutely trifling. The same laws which\r\nsecure the property in land, secure to the owner the right of using it\r\nas he pleases.\r\n\r\nBut you are frightened at the prospect of a _consolidation of the\r\nStates_. I differ from you very widely. I am afraid, after all our\r\nattempts to unite the States, that contending interests, and the pride\r\nof State sovereignties, will either prevent our union, or render our\r\nfederal government weak, slow and inefficient. The danger is all on this\r\nside. If any thing under heaven now endangers our liberties and\r\nindependence, it is that single circumstance.\r\n\r\nYou harp upon that clause of the new constitution, which declares, that\r\nthe laws of the United States, &c. shall be the supreme law of the land;\r\nwhen you know that the powers of the Congress are defined, to extend\r\nonly to those matters which are in their nature and effects, _general_.\r\nYou know, the Congress cannot meddle with the internal police of any\r\nState, or abridge its sovereignty. And you know, at the same time, that\r\nin all general concerns, the laws of Congress must be _supreme_, or they\r\nmust be _nothing_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XIV.\r\n\r\n                         PHILADELPHIA, MARCH, 1787.\r\n\r\n_On_ TEST LAWS, OATHS _of_ ALLEGIANCE _and_ ABJURATION, _and_ PARTIAL\r\nEXCLUSIONS _from_ OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo change the current of opinion, is a most difficult task, and the\r\nattempt is often ridiculed. For this reason, I expect the following\r\nremarks will be passed over with a slight reading, and all attention to\r\nthem cease with a hum.\r\n\r\nThe revisal of the test law has at length passed by a respectable\r\nmajority of the Representativs of this State. This is a prelude to wiser\r\nmeasures; people are just awaking from delusion. The time will come (and\r\nmay the day be near!) when all test laws, oaths of allegiance,\r\nabjuration, and partial exclusions from civil offices, will be\r\nproscribed from this land of freedom.\r\n\r\nAmericans! what was the origin of these discriminations? What is their\r\nuse?\r\n\r\nThey originated in savage ignorance, and they are the instruments of\r\nslavery. Emperors and generals, who wished to attach their subjects to\r\ntheir persons and government; who wished to exercise despotic sway over\r\nthem, or prosecute villanous wars, (for mankind have always been\r\nbutchering each other) found the solemnity of oaths had an excellent\r\neffect on poor superstitious soldiers and vassals; oracles, demons,\r\neclipses; all the terrifying phenomena of nature, have at times had\r\nremarkable effects in securing the obedience of men to tyrants. Oaths of\r\nfealty, and farcical ceremonies of homage, were very necessary to rivet\r\nthe chains of feudal vassals; for the whole system of European tenures\r\nwas erected on usurpation, and is supported solely by ignorance,\r\nsuperstition, artifice, or military force. Oaths of allegiance may\r\npossibly be still necessary in Europe, where there are so many\r\ncontending powers contiguous to each other: But what is their use in\r\nAmerica? To secure fidelity to the State, it will be answered. But where\r\nis the danger of defection? Will the inhabitants join the British in\r\nNova Scotia or Canada? Will they rebel? Will they join the savages, and\r\noverthrow the State? No; all these are visionary dangers. My countrymen,\r\nif a State has any thing to fear from its inhabitants, the constitution\r\nor the laws must be wrong. Danger cannot possibly arise from any other\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nPermit me to offer a few ideas to your minds; and let them be the\r\nsubject of more than one hour's reflection.\r\n\r\nAn oath creates no new obligation. A witness, who swears to tell the\r\nwhole truth, is under no new obligation to tell the whole truth. An oath\r\nreminds him of his duty; he swears to do as he ought to do; that is, he\r\nadds an express promise to an implied one. A moral obligation is not\r\ncapable of addition or diminution.\r\n\r\nWhen a man steps his foot into a State, he becomes subject to its\r\ngeneral laws. When he joins it as a member, he is subject to all its\r\nlaws. The act of entering into society, binds him to submit to its laws,\r\nand to promote its interest. Every man, who livs under a government, is\r\nunder allegiance to that government. Ten thousand oaths do not increase\r\nthe obligation upon him to be a faithful subject.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be asked, how shall we distinguish between the friends and\r\nenemies of the government? I answer, by annihilating all distinctions. A\r\ngood constitution, and good laws, make good subjects. I challenge the\r\nhistory of mankind to produce an instance of bad subjects under a good\r\ngovernment. The test law in Pensylvania has produced more disorder, by\r\nmaking enemies in this State, than have cursed all the union besides.\r\nDuring the war, every thing gave way to force; but the feelings and\r\nprinciples of war ought to be forgotten in peace.\r\n\r\nAbjuration! a badge of folly, borrowed from the dark ages of bigotry. If\r\nthe government of Pensylvania is better than that of Great Britain, the\r\nsubjects will prefer it, and abjuration is perfectly nugatory. If not,\r\nthe subject will have his partialities in spite of any solemn\r\nrenunciation of a foreign power.\r\n\r\nBut what right has even the Legislature to deprive any class of citizens\r\nof the benefits and emoluments of civil government? If any men have\r\nforfeited their lives or estates, they are no longer subjects; they\r\nought to be banished or hung. If not, no law ought to exclude them from\r\ncivil emoluments. If any have committed public crimes, they are\r\npunishable; if any have been guilty, and have not been detected, the\r\noath, as it now stands, obliges them to confess their guilt. To take the\r\noath, is an implicit acknowlegement of innocence; to refuse it, is an\r\nimplicit confession that the person has aided and abetted the enemy.\r\nThis is rank despotism. The inquisition can do no more than force\r\nconfession from the accused.\r\n\r\nI pray God to enlighten the minds of the Americans. I wish they would\r\nshake off every badge of tyranny. Americans!--The best way to make men\r\nhonest, is to let them enjoy equal rights and privileges; never suspect\r\na set of men will be rogues, and make laws proclaiming that suspicion.\r\nLeave force to govern the wretched vassals of European nabobs, and\r\nreconcile subjects to your own constitutions by their excellent nature\r\nand beneficial effects. No man will commence enemy to a government which\r\ngivs him as many privileges as his neighbors enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XV.\r\n\r\nSKETCHES _of the_ RISE, PROGRESS _and_ CONSEQUENCES _of the late_\r\nREVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nWritten in the years 1787, 1788, and 1789; now republished, with\r\nmaterial corrections, and a LETTER from the late COMMANDER in CHIEF,\r\nexplaining the Circumstances and Proceedings, preparatory to the Capture\r\nof Lord CORNWALLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerica was originally peopled by uncivilized nations, which lived\r\nmostly by hunting and fishing. The Europeans, who first visited these\r\nshores, treating the nativs as wild beasts of the forest, which have no\r\nproperty in the woods where they roam, planted the standard of their\r\nrespectiv masters where they first landed, and in their names claimed\r\nthe country by _right of discovery_.[44] Prior to any settlement in\r\nNorth America numerous titles of this kind were acquired by the English,\r\nFrench, Spanish, and Dutch navigators, who came hither for the purposes\r\nof fishing and trading with the nativs. Slight as such titles were, they\r\nwere afterwards the causes of contention between the European nations.\r\nThe subjects of different princes often laid claim to the same tract of\r\ncountry, because both had discovered the same river or promontary; or\r\nbecause the extent of their respectiv claims was indeterminate.\r\n\r\n    [44] As well may the New Zealanders, who have not yet\r\n    discovered Europe, fit out a ship, land on the coast of\r\n    England or France, and, finding no inhabitants but poor\r\n    fishermen and peasants, claim the whole country by _right of\r\n    discovery_.\r\n\r\nWhile the settlements in this vast uncultivated country were\r\ninconsiderable and scattered, and the trade of it confined to the\r\nbartering of a few trinkets for furs, a trade carried on by a few\r\nadventurers, the interfering of claims produced no important controversy\r\namong the settlers or the nations of Europe. But in proportion to the\r\nprogress of population, and the growth of the American trade, the\r\njealousies of the nations, which had made early discoveries and\r\nsettlements on this coast, were alarmed; ancient claims were revived;\r\nand each power took measures to extend and secure its own possessions at\r\nthe expense of a rival.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the English claimed a right of cutting\r\nlogwood in the Bay of Campeachy, in South America. In the exercise of\r\nthis right, the English merchants had frequent opportunities of carrying\r\non a contraband trade with the Spanish settlements on the continent. To\r\nremedy this evil, the Spaniards resolved to annihilate a claim, which,\r\nthough often acknowleged, had never been clearly ascertained. To effect\r\nthis design, they captured the English vessels, which they found along\r\nthe Spanish Main, and many of the British subjects were doomed to work\r\nin the mines of Potosi.\r\n\r\nRepeated severities of this kind at length (1739) produced a war between\r\nEngland and Spain. Porto Bello was taken from the Spaniards, by Admiral\r\nVernon. Commodore Anson, with a squadron of ships, sailed to the South\r\nSeas, distressed the Spanish settlements on the western shore of\r\nAmerica, and took a galleon, laden with immense riches. But in 1741 a\r\nformidable armament, destined to attack Carthagena, under the command of\r\nLord Cathcart, returned unsuccessful, with the loss of upwards of twelve\r\nthousand British soldiers and seamen; and the defeat of the expedition,\r\nraised a clamor against the minister, Sir Robert Walpole, which produced\r\na change in the administration. This change removed the scene of war to\r\nEurope, so that America was not immediately affected by the subsequent\r\ntransactions; except that Louisburgh, the principal fortress of Cape\r\nBreton, was taken from the French by General Pepperell, assisted by\r\nCommodore Warren and a body of New England troops.\r\n\r\nThis war was ended in 1748 by the treaty of peace signed at Aix la\r\nChapelle, by which restitution was made on both sides of all places\r\ntaken during the war.\r\n\r\nPeace, however, was of short duration. The French possessed Canada, and\r\nhad made considerable settlements in Florida, claiming the country on\r\nboth sides of the Missisippi, by right of discovery. To secure and\r\nextend their claims, they established a line of forts, on the English\r\npossessions, from Canada to Florida. They had secured the important pass\r\nat Niagara, and erected a fort at the junction of the Allegany and\r\nMonongahela rivers, called Fort Du Quesne. They took pains to secure the\r\nfriendship and assistance of the nativs, encroachments were made upon\r\nthe English possessions, and mutual injuries succeeded. The disputes\r\namong the settlers in America, and the measures taken by the French to\r\ncommand all the trade of the St. Lawrence river on the north, and of the\r\nMissisippi on the south, excited a jealousy in the English nation, which\r\nsoon broke forth in open war.\r\n\r\nIn 1756, four expeditions were undertaken in America against the French.\r\nOne was conducted by General Monckton, who had orders to drive the\r\nFrench from the encroachments on the province of Nova Scotia. This\r\nexpedition was attended with success. General Johnson was ordered, with\r\na body of troops, to take possession of Crown Point, but he did not\r\nsucceed. General Shirley commanded an expedition against the fort at\r\nNiagara, but lost the season by delay. General Braddock marched against\r\nfort Du Quesne, but in penetrating through the wilderness, he\r\nincautiously fell into an ambuscade and suffered a total defeat. General\r\nBraddock was killed, but a part of his troops were saved by the prudence\r\nand bravery of General Washington, at this time a Colonel, who then\r\nbegan to exhibit proofs of those military talents, by which he\r\nafterwards conducted the armies of America to victory, and his country\r\nto independence. The ill success of these expeditions left the English\r\nsettlements in America exposed to the depredations of both the French\r\nand Indians. But the war now raged in Europe and the East Indies, and\r\nengaged the attention of both nations in those quarters.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the campaign in 1758, that affairs assumed a more\r\nfavorable aspect in America. But upon a change of administration, Mr.\r\nPitt was appointed Prime Minister, and the operations of war became more\r\nvigorous and successful. General Amherst was sent to take possession of\r\nCape Breton; and after a warm siege, the garrison of Louisburgh\r\nsurrendered by capitulation. General Forbes was successful in taking\r\npossession of fort Du Quesne, which the French thought fit to abandon.\r\nBut General Abercrombie, who commanded the troops destined to act\r\nagainst the French at Crown Point and Ticonderoga, attacked the lines at\r\nTiconderoga, where the enemy were strongly entrenched, and was defeated\r\nwith a terrible slaughter of his troops. After his defeat, he returned\r\nto his camp at Lake George.\r\n\r\nThe next year, more effectual measures were taken to subdue the French\r\nin America. General Prideaux and Sir William Johnson began the\r\noperations of the campaign by taking the French fort near Niagara.[45]\r\nGeneral Amherst took possession of the forts at Crown Point and\r\nTiconderoga, which the French had abandoned.\r\n\r\n    [45] General Prideaux was killed by the bursting of a mortar,\r\n    before the surrender of the French.\r\n\r\nBut the decisiv blow, which proved fatal to the French interests in\r\nAmerica, was the defeat of the French army, and the taking of Quebec, by\r\nthe brave general Wolfe. This hero was slain in the beginning of the\r\naction, on the plains of Abram, and Monsieur Montcalm, the French\r\ncommander, likewise lost his life. The loss of Quebec was soon followed\r\nby the capture of Montreal, by General Amherst, and Canada has remained\r\never since in possession of the English.\r\n\r\nColonel Grant, in 1761, defeated the Cherokees in Carolina, and obliged\r\nthem to sue for peace. The next year, Martinico was taken by Admiral\r\nRodney and General Monkton; and also the islands of Grenada, St.\r\nVincents, and others. The capture of these was soon followed by the\r\nsurrender of the Havanna, the capital of the island of Cuba.\r\n\r\nIn 1763, a definitiv treaty of peace was concluded at Paris, between\r\nGreat Britain, France and Spain, by which the English ceded to the\r\nFrench several islands in the West Indies, but were confirmed in the\r\npossession of all North America on this side the Missisippi, except New\r\nOrleans, and a small district of the neighboring country.\r\n\r\nBut this war, however brilliant the success, and glorious the event,\r\nproved the cause of great and unexpected misfortunes to Great Britain.\r\nEngaged with the combined powers of France and Spain, during several\r\nyears, her exertions were surprising, and her expense immense. To\r\ndischarge the debts of the nation, the parliament was obliged to have\r\nrecourse to new expedients for raising money. Previous to the last\r\ntreaty in 1763, the parliament had been satisfied to raise a revenue\r\nfrom the American Colonies by monopoly of their trade.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the last war with France, commissioners from many of\r\nthe colonies had assembled at Albany, and proposed that a great council\r\nshould be formed by deputies from the several colonies, which, with a\r\ngeneral Governor to be appointed by the crown, should be empowered to\r\ntake measures for the common safety, and to raise money for the\r\nexecution of their designs. This proposal was not relished by the\r\nBritish ministry; but in place of this plan, it was proposed, that the\r\nGovernors of the colonies, with the assistance of one or two of their\r\ncouncil, should assemble and concert measures for the general defence;\r\nerect forts, levy troops, and draw on the treasury of England for monies\r\nthat should be wanted; but the treasury to be reimbursed by a tax on the\r\ncolonies, to be laid by the English parliament. To this plan, which\r\nwould imply an avowal of the right of parliament to tax the colonies,\r\nthe provincial assemblies objected with unshaken firmness. It seems,\r\ntherefore, that the British parliament, _before_ the war, had it in\r\ncontemplation to exercise the right they claimed of taxing the colonies\r\nat pleasure, without permitting them to be represented. Indeed it is\r\nobvious that they laid hold of the alarming situation of the colonies\r\nabout the year 1754, and 1755, to force them into an acknowlegement of\r\nthe right, or to the adoption of measures that might afterwards be drawn\r\ninto precedent. The colonies however, with an uncommon foresight and\r\nfirmness, defeated all their attempts. The war was carried on by\r\nrequisitions on the colonies for supplies of men and money, or by\r\nvoluntary contributions.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner was peace concluded, than the English parliament resumed\r\nthe plan of taxing the colonies; and to justify their attempts, said,\r\nthat the money to be raised, was to be appropriated to defray the\r\nexpense of defending them in the late war.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to raise a revenue in America appeared in the\r\nmemorable _stamp act_, passed March 22, 1765; by which it was enacted\r\nthat certain instruments of writing, as bills, bonds, &c. should not be\r\nvalid in law, unless drawn on stamped paper, on which a duty was laid.\r\nNo sooner was this act published in America, than it raised a general\r\nalarm. The people were filled with apprehensions at an act which they\r\nsupposed an attack on their constitutional rights. The colonies\r\npetitioned the king and parliament for a redress of the grievance, and\r\nformed associations for the purpose of preventing the importation and\r\nuse of British manufactures, until the act should be repealed. This\r\nspirited and unanimous opposition of the Americans produced the desired\r\neffect; and on the 18th of March, 1766, the stamp act was repealed. The\r\nnews of the repeal was received in the colonies with universal joy, and\r\nthe trade between them and Great Britain was renewed on the most liberal\r\nfooting.\r\n\r\nThe parliament, by repealing this act, so obnoxious to their American\r\nbrethren, did not intend to lay aside the scheme of raising a revenue in\r\nthe colonies, but merely to change the mode. Accordingly the next year,\r\nthey passed an act, laying a certain duty on glass, tea, paper, and\r\npainters' colors; articles which were much wanted, and not manufactured,\r\nin America. This act kindled the resentment of the Americans, and\r\nexcited a general opposition to the measure; so that parliament thought\r\nproper in 1770, to take off these duties, except three pence a pound on\r\ntea. Yet this duty, however trifling, kept alive the jealousy of the\r\ncolonists, and their opposition to parliamentary taxation continued and\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nBut it must be remembered that the inconvenience of paying the duty was\r\nnot the sole, nor principal cause of the opposition, it was the\r\n_principle_ which, once admitted, would have subjected the colonies to\r\nunlimitted parliamentary taxation, without the privilege of being\r\nrepresented. The _right_, abstractly considered, was denied; and the\r\nsmallest attempt to establish the claim by precedent, was uniformly\r\nresisted. The Americans could not be deceived as to the views of\r\nparliament; for the repeal of the stamp act was accompanied with an\r\nunequivocal declaration, \"that the parliament had a right to make laws\r\nof sufficient validity to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonies therefore entered into measures to encourage their own\r\nmanufactures, and home productions, and to retrench the use of foreign\r\nsuperfluities; while the importation of tea was prohibited. In the royal\r\nand proprietary governments, the Governors and people were in a state of\r\ncontinual warfare. Assemblies were repeatedly called, and suddenly\r\ndissolved. While sitting, the assemblies employed the time in dating\r\ngrievances and framing remonstrances. To inflame these discontents, an\r\nact of parliament was passed, ordaining that the Governors and Judges\r\nshould receive their salaries of the crown; thus making them independent\r\nof the provincial assemblies, and removeable only at the pleasure of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nThese arbitrary proceedings, with many others not here mentioned, could\r\nnot fail of producing a rupture. The first act of violence, was the\r\nmassacre at Boston, on the evening of the fifth of March, 1770. A body\r\nof British troops had been stationed in Boston to awe the inhabitants,\r\nand enforce the measures of parliament. On the fatal day, when blood was\r\nto be shed, as a preclude to more tragic scenes, a riot was raised among\r\nsome soldiers and boys; the former aggressing by throwing snow balls at\r\nthe latter. The bickerings and jealousies between the inhabitants and\r\nsoldiers, which had been frequent before, now became serious. A\r\nmultitude was soon collected, and the controversy became so warm, that\r\nto disperse the people, the troops were embodied and ordered to fire\r\nupon the inhabitants. This fatal order was executed, and several persons\r\nfell a sacrifice. The people restrained their vengeance at the time; but\r\nthis wanton act of cruelty and military despotism fanned the flame of\r\nliberty; a flame that was not to be extinguished but by a total\r\nseparation of the colonies from their oppressiv and hostile parent.\r\n\r\nIn 1773, the spirit of the Americans broke out into open violence. The\r\nGaspee, an armed schooner, belonging to his Britannic Majesty, had been\r\nstationed at Providence, in Rhode Island, to prevent smuggling. The\r\nvigilance of the commander irritated the inhabitants to that degree,\r\nthat about two hundred armed men entered the vessel at night, compelled\r\nthe officers and men to go on shore, and set fire to the schooner. A\r\nreward of five hundred pounds, offered by government for apprehending\r\nany of the persons concerned in this daring act, produced no effectual\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the discovery and publication of some private\r\nconfidential letters, written by the royal officers in Boston, to\r\npersons in office in England, served to confirm the apprehensions of the\r\nAmericans, with respect to the designs of the British government. It was\r\nnow made obvious that more effectual measures would be taken to\r\nestablish the supremacy of the British parliament over the colonies. The\r\nletters recommended decisiv measures, and the writers were charged, by\r\nthe exasperated Americans, with betraying their trust and the people\r\nthey governed.\r\n\r\nAs the resolutions of the colonies not to import or consume tea, had, in\r\na great measure, deprived the English government of a revenue from this\r\nquarter, the parliament formed a scheme of introducing tea into America,\r\nunder cover of the East India company. For this purpose an act was\r\npassed, enabling the company to export all sorts of teas, duty free, to\r\nany place whatever. The company departed from their usual mode of\r\nbusiness and became their own exporters. Several ships were freighted\r\nwith teas, and sent to the American colonies, and factors were appointed\r\nto receive and dispose of their cargoes.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, determined to oppose the revenue system of the English\r\nparliament in every possible shape, considered the attempt of the East\r\nIndia company to evade the resolutions of the colonies, and dispose of\r\nteas in America, as an indirect mode of taxation, sanctioned by the\r\nauthority of parliament. The people assembled in various places, and in\r\nthe large commercial towns, took measures to prevent the landing of the\r\nteas. Committees were appointed, and armed with extensiv powers to\r\ninspect merchants' books, to propose tests, and make use of other\r\nexpedients to frustrate the designs of the East India company. The same\r\nspirit pervaded the people from New Hampshire to Georgia. In some\r\nplaces, the consignees of the teas were intimidated so far as to\r\nrelinquish their appointments, or to enter into engagements not to act\r\nin that capacity. The cargo sent to South Carolina was stored, the\r\nconsignees being restrained from offering the tea for sale. In other\r\nprovinces, the ships were sent back without discharging their cargoes.\r\n\r\nBut in Boston the tea shared a more violent fate. Sensible that no local\r\nmeasures could prevent its being landed, and that if once landed, it\r\nwould be disposed of; a number of men in disguise, on the 18th of\r\nDecember 1773, entered the ships and threw overboard three hundred and\r\nforty chests of it, which was the proportion belonging to the East India\r\ncompany. No sooner did the news of this destruction of the tea reach\r\nGreat Britain, than the parliament determined to punish that devoted\r\ntown. On the king's laying the American papers before them, a bill was\r\nbrought in and passed, \"to discontinue the landing and discharging,\r\nlading and shipping of goods, wares and merchandizes at the town of\r\nBoston, or within the harbor.\"\r\n\r\nThis act, passed March 25, 1774, called the Boston port bill, threw the\r\ninhabitants of Massachusetts into the greatest consternation. The town\r\nof Boston passed a resolution, expressing their sense of this oppressiv\r\nmeasure, and a desire that all the colonies would concur to stop all\r\nimportation from Great Britain. Most of the colonies entered into\r\nspirited resolutions, on this occasion, to unite with Massachusetts in a\r\nfirm opposition to the unconstitutional measures of the parliament. The\r\nfirst of June, the day on which the port bill was to take place, was\r\nappointed to be kept as a day of humiliation, fasting and prayer\r\nthroughout the colonies, to seek the divine direction and aid, in that\r\ncritical and gloomy juncture of affairs.\r\n\r\nDuring the height of the consternation and confusion which the Boston\r\nport bill occasioned; at the very time when a town meeting was sitting\r\nto consider of it, General Gage, who had been appointed to the\r\ngovernment of Massachusetts, arrived in the harbor. His arrival however\r\ndid not allay the popular ferment, or check the progress of the measures\r\nthen taking, to unite the colonies in opposition to the oppressiv act of\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\nBut the port bill was not the only act that alarmed the apprehensions of\r\nthe Americans. Determined to compel the province of Massachusetts to\r\nsubmit to their laws, parliament passed an act for \"the better\r\nregulating government in the province of Massachusetts Bay.\" The object\r\nof this act was to alter the government, as it stood on the charter of\r\nking William, to take the appointment of the executiv out of the hands\r\nof the people, and place it in the crown; thus making even the judges\r\nand sheriffs dependent on the king, and removeable only at his pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis act was soon followed by another, which ordained that any person,\r\nindicted for murder, or other capital offence, committed in aiding the\r\nmagistrates in executing the laws, might be sent by the governor either\r\nto another colony, or to Great Britain for his trial.\r\n\r\nThis was soon followed by the Quebec bill; which extended the bounds of\r\nthat province, and granted many privileges to the Roman Catholics. The\r\nobject of this bill was, to secure the attachment of that province to\r\nthe crown of England, and prevent its joining the colonies in their\r\nresistance to the laws of parliament.\r\n\r\nBut these measures did not intimidate the Americans. On the other hand\r\nthey served to confirm their former apprehensions of the evil designs of\r\ngovernment, and to unite the colonies in their opposition. A\r\ncorrespondence of opinion with respect to the unconstitutional acts of\r\nparliament, produced a uniformity of proceedings in the colonies. The\r\npeople generally concurred in a proposition for holding a Congress by\r\ndeputation from the several colonies, in order to concert measures for\r\nthe preservation of their rights. Deputies were accordingly appointed,\r\nand met at Philadelphia, on the 26th of October, 1774.\r\n\r\nIn this first Congress, the proceedings were cool, deliberate and loyal;\r\nbut marked with unanimity and firmness. Their first act was a\r\ndeclaration, or state of their claims as to the enjoyment of all the\r\nrights of British subjects, and particularly that of taxing themselves\r\nexclusivly, and of regulating the internal police of the colonies. They\r\nalso drew up a petition to the king, complaining of their grievances and\r\npraying for a repeal of the unconstitutional and oppressiv acts of\r\nparliament. They signed an association to suspend the importation of\r\nBritish goods, and the exportation of American produce, until their\r\ngrievances should be redressed. They sent an address to the inhabitants\r\nof Great Britain, and another to the people of America; in the former\r\nof which they enumerated the oppressiv steps of parliament, and called\r\non their British brethren not to aid the ministry in enslaving their\r\nAmerican subjects; and in the latter, they endeavored to confirm the\r\npeople in a spirited and unanimous determination to defend their\r\nconstitutional rights.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, every thing in Massachusetts wore the appearance of\r\nopposition by force. A new council for the Governor had been appointed\r\nby the crown. New judges were appointed, and attempted to proceed in the\r\nexecution of their office. But the juries refused to be sworn under\r\nthem; in some counties, the people assembled to prevent the courts from\r\nproceeding to business; and in Berkshire they succeeded, setting an\r\nexample of resistance that has since been followed, in violation of the\r\nlaws of the State.\r\n\r\nIn this situation of affairs, the day for the annual muster of the\r\nmilitia approached. General Gage, apprehensiv of some violence, had the\r\nprecaution to seize the magazines of ammunition and stores at Cambridge\r\nand Charlestown, and lodged them in Boston. This measure, with the\r\nfortifying of that neck of land which joins Boston to the main land at\r\nRoxbury, caused a universal alarm and ferment. Several thousand people\r\nassembled, and it was with difficulty they could be restrained from\r\nfalling upon the British troops.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, an assembly of delegates from all the towns in Suffolk\r\ncounty, was called; and several spirited resolutions were agreed to.\r\nThese resolutions were prefaced with a declaration of allegiance; but\r\nthey breathed a spirit of freedom that does honor to the delegates. They\r\ndeclared that the late acts of parliament and the proceedings of General\r\nGage, were glaring infractions of their rights and liberties, which\r\ntheir duty called them to defend by all lawful means.\r\n\r\nThis assembly remonstrated against the fortification of Boston neck, and\r\nagainst the Quebec bill; and resolved upon a suspension of commerce, and\r\nencouragement of arts and manufactures, the holding of a provincial\r\nCongress, and a submission to the measures which should be recommended\r\nby the Continental Congress. They recommended that the collectors of\r\ntaxes should not pay any money into the treasury, without further\r\norders; they also recommended peace and good order, as they meant to act\r\nmerely upon the defensiv.\r\n\r\nIn answer to their remonstrance, General Gage assured them that he had\r\nno intention to prevent the free egress and regress of the inhabitants\r\nto and from the town of Boston, and that he would not suffer any person\r\nunder his command to injure the person or property of any of his\r\nmajesty's subjects.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this, a General Assembly had been summoned to meet; and\r\nnotwithstanding the writs had been countermanded by the Governor's\r\nproclamation, on account of the violence of the times and the\r\nresignation of several of the new counsellors, yet representativs were\r\nchosen by the people, who met at Salem, resolved themselves into a\r\nprovincial Congress, and adjourned to Concord.\r\n\r\nThis Congress addressed the Governor with a rehearsal of their\r\ndistresses, and took the necessary steps for defending their rights.\r\nThey regulated the militia, made provision for supplying the treasury,\r\nand furnishing the people with arms; and such was the enthusiasm and\r\nunion of the people, that the recommendations of the provincial Congress\r\nhad the force of laws.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gage was incensed at these measures; he declared, in his answer\r\nto the address, that Britain could never harbor the black design of\r\nenslaving her subjects, and published a proclamation in which he\r\ninsinuated that such proceedings amounted to rebellion. He also ordered\r\nbarracks to be erected for the soldiers; but he found difficulty in\r\nprocuring laborers, either in Boston or New York.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1775, the fishery bills were passed in parliament,\r\nby which the colonies were prohibited to trade with Great Britain,\r\nIreland or the West Indies, or to take fish on the banks of\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\nIn the distresses to which these acts of parliament reduced the town of\r\nBoston, the unanimity of the colonies was remarkable, in the large\r\nsupplies of provision, furnished by the inhabitants of different towns\r\nfrom New Hampshire to Georgia, and shipped to the relief of the\r\nsufferers.\r\n\r\nPreparations began to be made, to oppose by force, the execution of\r\nthese acts of parliament. The militia of the country were trained to the\r\nuse of arms; great encouragement was given for the manufacture of\r\ngunpowder, and measures were taken to obtain all kinds of military\r\nstores.\r\n\r\nIn February, Colonel Leslie was sent with a detachment of troops from\r\nBoston, to take possession of some cannon at Salem. But the people had\r\nintelligence of the design, took up the draw bridge in that town, and\r\nprevented the troops from passing, until the cannon were secured; so\r\nthat the expedition failed.\r\n\r\nIn April, Colonel Smith, and Major Pitcairn were sent with a body of\r\nabout nine hundred troops, to destroy the military stores which had been\r\ncollected at Concord, about twenty miles from Boston. It is believed,\r\nthat another object of this expedition, was to seize on the persons of\r\nMessrs. Hancock and Adams, who, by their spirited exertions, had\r\nrendered themselves very obnoxious to General Gage. At Lexington, the\r\nmilitia were collected on a green, to oppose the incursion of the\r\nBritish forces. These were fired upon by the British troops, and eight\r\nmen killed on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe militia were dispersed, and the troops proceeded to Concord; where\r\nthey destroyed a few stores. But on their return, they were incessantly\r\nharrassed by the Americans, who, inflamed with just resentment, fired\r\nupon them from houses and fences, and pursued them to Boston. The loss\r\nof the British in this expedition, in killed, wounded and prisoners, was\r\ntwo hundred and seventy three men.\r\n\r\nHere was spilt the _first blood_ in the late war; a war which severed\r\nAmerica from the British empire. _Lexington_ opened the first scene of\r\nthis great drama, which, in its progress, exhibited the most illustrious\r\ncharacters and events, and closed with a revolution, equally glorious\r\nfor the actors, and important in its consequences to mankind.\r\n\r\nThis battle roused all America. The militia collected from all quarters,\r\nand Boston, in a few days was besieged by twenty thousand men. A stop\r\nwas put to all intercourse between the town and country, and the\r\ninhabitants were reduced to great want of provisions. General Gage\r\npromised to let the people depart, if they would deliver up their arms.\r\nThe people complied; but when the General had obtained their arms, the\r\nperfidious man refused to let the people go.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, a small number of men, to the amount of about two\r\nhundred and forty, under the command of Colonel Allen, and Colonel\r\nEaston, without any public orders, surprised and took the British\r\ngarrisons at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, without the loss of a man on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\nDuring these transactions, the Generals Howe, Burgoyne, and Clinton,\r\narrived at Boston from England, with a number of troops. In June\r\nfollowing, our troops attempted to fortify Bunker's hill, which lies\r\nnear Charlestown, and but a mile and an half from Boston. They had,\r\nduring the night, thrown up a small breast work, which sheltered them\r\nfrom the fire of the British cannon. But the next morning, the British\r\narmy was sent to drive them from the hill, and, landing under cover of\r\ntheir cannon, they set fire to Charlestown, which was consumed, and\r\nmarched to attack our troops in the entrenchments. A severe engagement\r\nensued, in which the British, according to their own accounts, had seven\r\nhundred and forty killed, and eleven hundred and fifty wounded. They\r\nwere repulsed at first, and thrown into disorder; but they finally\r\ncarried the fortification, with the point of the bayonet. The Americans\r\nsuffered a small loss, compared with the British; the whole loss in\r\nkilled, wounded, and prisoners, being but about four hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\nThe loss most lamented on this bloody day, was that of Dr. Warren, who\r\nwas at this time a Major General, and commanded the troops on this\r\noccasion. He died like a brave man, fighting valiantly at the head of\r\nhis party, in a little redoubt at the right of our lines.\r\n\r\nGeneral Warren, who had rendered himself conspicuous by his universal\r\nmerit, abilities, and eloquence, had been a delegate to the first\r\ngeneral Congress, and was at this time President of the provincial\r\nCongress of Massachusetts. But quitting the humane and peaceable walk of\r\nhis profession as a physician, and breaking through the endearing ties\r\nof family connexions, he proved himself equally calculated for the\r\nfield, as for public business or private study.\r\n\r\nAbout this, time, the Continental Congress appointed George Washington,\r\nEsq. a nativ of Virginia, to the chief command of the American arm. This\r\ngentleman had been a distinguished and successful officer in the\r\npreceding war, and he seemed destined by heaven to be the savior of his\r\ncountry. He accepted the appointment with a diffidence which was a proof\r\nof his prudence and his greatness. He refused any pay for eight years\r\nlaborious and arduous service; and by his matchless skill, fortitude and\r\nperseverance, conducted America thro indescribeable difficulties, to\r\nindependence and peace.\r\n\r\nWhile true merit is esteemed, or virtue honored, mankind will never\r\ncease to revere the memory of this Hero; and while gratitude remains in\r\nthe human breast, the praises of WASHINGTON shall dwell on every\r\nAmerican tongue.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington, with other officers appointed by Congress, arrived\r\nat Cambridge, and took command of the American army in July. From this\r\ntime, the affairs of America began to assume the appearance of a regular\r\nand general opposition to the forces of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn autumn, a body of troops, under the command of General Montgomery,\r\nbesieged and took the garrison at St. John's, which commands the\r\nentrance into Canada. The prisoners amounted to about seven hundred.\r\nGeneral Montgomery pursued his success, and took Montreal; and designed\r\nto push his victories to Quebec.\r\n\r\nA body of troops, commanded by General Arnold, was ordered to march to\r\nCanada, by the river Kennebeck, and through the wilderness. After\r\nsuffering every hardship, and the most distressing hunger, they arrived\r\nin Canada, and were joined by General Montgomery, before Quebec. This\r\ncity, which was commanded by Governor Carleton, was immediately\r\nbesieged. But there being little hope of taking the town by a siege, it\r\nwas determined to storm it.\r\n\r\nThe attack was made on the last day of December, but proved\r\nunsuccessful, and fatal to the brave General, who, with his aid, was\r\nkilled in attempting to scale the walls.\r\n\r\nOf the three divisions which attacked the town, one only entered, and\r\nthat was obliged to surrender to superior force. After this defeat,\r\nGeneral Arnold, who now commanded the troops, continued some months\r\nbefore Quebec, altho his troops suffered incredibly by cold and\r\nsickness. But the next spring, the Americans were obliged to retreat\r\nfrom Canada.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the large and flourishing town of Norfolk, in Virginia,\r\nwas wantonly burnt by order of lord Dunmore, the then royal Governor of\r\nthat province.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gage went to England in September, and was succeeded in the\r\ncommand, by General Howe.\r\n\r\nFalmouth, a considerable town in the province of Maine, in\r\nMassachusetts, shared the fate of Norfolk; being laid in ashes by order\r\nof the British admiral.\r\n\r\nThe British king entered into treaties with some of the German princes\r\nfor about seventeen thousand men, who were to be sent to America the\r\nnext year, to assist in subduing the colonies. The parliament also\r\npassed an act, forbidding all intercourse with America; and while they\r\nrepealed the Boston port and fishery bills, they declared all American\r\nproperty on the high seas, forfeited to the captors. This act induced\r\nCongress to change the mode of carrying on the war; and measures were\r\ntaken to annoy the enemy in Boston. For this purpose, batteries were\r\nopened on several hills, from whence shot and bombs were thrown into the\r\ntown. But the batteries which were opened on Dorchester point had the\r\nbest effect, and soon obliged General Howe to abandon the town. In\r\nMarch, 1776, the British troops embarked for Halifax, and General\r\nWashington entered the town in triumph.\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing summer, a small squadron of ships commanded by Sir Peter\r\nParker, and a body of troops under the Generals Clinton and Cornwallis,\r\nattempted to take Charleston, the capital of South Carolina. The ships\r\nmade a violent attack upon the fort on Sullivan's Island, but were\r\nrepulsed with great loss, and the expedition was abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn July, Congress published their declaration of independence, which\r\nseparated America from Great Britain. This great event took place two\r\nhundred and eighty four years after the first discovery of America by\r\nColumbus; one hundred and sixty six, from the first effectual settlement\r\nin Virginia; and one hundred and fifty six from the first settlement of\r\nPlymouth, in Massachusetts, which were the earliest English settlements\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nJust after this declaration, General Howe with a powerful force arrived\r\nnear New York, and landed the troops upon Staten Island. General\r\nWashington was in New York with about thirteen thousand men, who were\r\nencamped either in the city or the neighboring fortifications.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the British began by the action on Long Island, in the\r\nmonth of August. The Americans were defeated, and General Sullivan and\r\nlord Sterling, with a large body of men, were made prisoners. The night\r\nafter the engagement, a retreat was ordered, and executed with such\r\nsilence, that the Americans left the island without alarming their\r\nenemies, and without loss.\r\n\r\nIn September, the city of New York was abandoned by the American army,\r\nand taken by the British.\r\n\r\nIn November, Fort Washington, on York Island, was taken, and more than\r\ntwo thousand men made prisoners. Fort Lee, opposit to Fort Washington,\r\non the Jersey shore, was soon after taken, but the garrison escaped.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, General Clinton was sent with a body of troops to\r\ntake possession of Rhode Island; and succeeded. In addition to all these\r\nlosses and defeats, the American army suffered by desertion, and more by\r\nsickness, which was epidemic, and very mortal.\r\n\r\nThe northern army at Ticonderoga, was in a disagreeable situation,\r\nparticularly after the battle on Lake Champlain, in which the American\r\nforce, consisting of a few light vessels, under the command of Generals\r\nArnold and Waterbury, was totally dispersed. But General Carleton,\r\ninstead of pursuing his victory, landed at Crown Point, reconnoitered\r\nour posts at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and returned to winter\r\nquarters in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe American army might now be said to be no more. All that now remained\r\nof an army, which at the opening of the campaign, amounted to at least\r\ntwenty five thousand men, did not now exceed three thousand. The term of\r\ntheir engagements being expired, they returned, in large bodies, to\r\ntheir families and friends; the few, who from personal attachment, local\r\ncircumstances, or superior perseverance and bravery, continued with the\r\nGenerals Washington and Lee, were too inconsiderable to appear\r\nformidable in the view of a powerful and victorious enemy.\r\n\r\nIn this alarming and critical situation of affairs, General Lee, through\r\nan imprudent carelessness, which ill became a man in his important\r\nstation, was captured by a party of the British light horse, commanded\r\nby Colonel Harcourt; this unfortunate circumstance gave a severe shock\r\nto the remaining hopes of the little army, and rendered their situation\r\ntruly distressing.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were transacting in New Jersey, General Washington,\r\nfar from being discouraged by the loss of General Lee, and always ready\r\nto improve every advantage to raise the drooping spirits of his handful\r\nof men, had made a stand on the Pensylvania side of the Delaware. Here\r\nhe collected his scattered forces, called in the assistance of the\r\nPensylvania militia, and on the night of the 25th of December, (1776)\r\nwhen the enemy were lulled into security by the idea of his weakness,\r\nand by the inclemency of the night, which was remarkably boisterous, as\r\nwell as by the fumes of a Christmas eve, he crossed the river, and at\r\nthe breaking of day, marched down to Trenton, and so completely\r\nsurprised them, that the greater part of the detachment which were\r\nstationed at this place, surrendered after a short resistance. The\r\nhorsemen and a few others made their escape at the opposit end of the\r\ntown. Upwards of nine hundred Hessians were taken prisoners at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThis successful expedition first gave a favorable turn to our affairs,\r\nwhich, after this, seemed to brighten thro the whole course of the war.\r\nSoon after, General Washington attacked the British troops at Princeton,\r\nand obtained a complete victory; not, however, without being bravely\r\nopposed by Colonel Mawhood.\r\n\r\nThe address in planning and executing these enterprises, reflected the\r\nhighest honor on the commander, and the success revived the desponding\r\nhopes of America. The loss of General Mercer, a gallant officer, at\r\nPrinceton, was the principal circumstance that allayed the joys of\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1777, was distinguished by very memorable events, in\r\nfavor of America. On the opening of the campaign, Governor Tryon was\r\nsent with a body of troops, to destroy the stores at Danbury, in\r\nConnecticut. This plan was executed, and the town mostly burnt. The\r\nenemy suffered in their retreat, and the Americans lost General Wooster,\r\na brave and experienced officer.\r\n\r\nGeneral Prescot was taken from his quarters, on Rhode Island, by the\r\naddress and enterprise of Colonel Barton, and conveyed prisoner to the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nGeneral Burgoyne, who commanded the northern British army, took\r\npossession of Ticonderoga, which had been abandoned by the Americans. He\r\npushed his successes, crossed Lake George, and encamped upon the banks\r\nof the Hudson, near Saratoga. His progress, however, was checked, by the\r\ndefeat of Colonel Baum, near Bennington, in which the undisciplined\r\nmilitia of Vermont, under General Stark, displayed unexampled bravery,\r\nand captured almost the whole detachment.\r\n\r\nThe militia assembled from all parts of New England, to stop the\r\nprogress of General Burgoyne.\r\n\r\nThese, with the regular troops, formed a respectable army, commanded by\r\nGeneral Gates. After two severe actions, in which the Generals Lincoln\r\nand Arnold, behaved with uncommon gallantry, and were wounded, General\r\nBurgoyne found himself enclosed with brave troops, and was forced to\r\nsurrender his whole army, amounting, according to some, to ten thousand,\r\nand according to others, to five thousand seven hundred and fifty two\r\nmen, into the hands of the Americans. This memorable event happened on\r\nthe 17th of October, 1777; and diffused an universal joy over America,\r\nand laid a foundation for the treaty with France.\r\n\r\nBut before these transactions, the main body of the British forces had\r\nembarked at New York, sailed up the Chesapeak, and landed at the head of\r\nElk river. The army soon began their march for Philadelphia. General\r\nWashington had determined to oppose them, and for this purpose made a\r\nstand, first at Red Clay Creek, and then upon the heights, near\r\nBrandywine Creek. Here the armies engaged, and the Americans were\r\noverpowered, and suffered great loss. The enemy soon pursued their\r\nmarch, and took possession of Philadelphia towards the close of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nNot long after, the two armies were again engaged at Germantown, and in\r\nthe beginning of the action, the Americans had the advantage; but by\r\nsome unlucky accident, the fortune of the day was turned in favor of the\r\nBritish. Both sides suffered considerable losses; on the side of the\r\nAmericans, was General Nash.\r\n\r\nIn an attack upon the forts at Mud Island and Red Bank, the Hessians\r\nwere unsuccessful, and their commander, Colonel Donop, killed. The\r\nBritish also lost the Augusta, a ship of the line. But the forts were\r\nafterwards taken, and the navigation of the Delaware opened. General\r\nWashington was reinforced, with part of the troops which had composed\r\nthe northern army, under General Gates; and both armies retired to\r\nwinter quarters.\r\n\r\nIn October, the same month in which General Burgoyne was taken at\r\nSaratoga, General Vaughan, with a small fleet, sailed up Hudson's river,\r\nand wantonly burnt Kingston, a beautiful Dutch settlement, on the west\r\nside of the river.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the next year, 1778, was distinguished by a treaty of\r\nalliance between France and America; by which we obtained a powerful and\r\ngenerous ally. When the English ministry were informed that this treaty\r\nwas on foot, they dispatched commissioners to America, to attempt a\r\nreconciliation. But America would not now accept their offers. Early in\r\nthe spring, Count de Estaing, with a fleet of fifteen sail of the line,\r\nwas sent by the court of France to assist America.\r\n\r\nGeneral Howe left the army, and returned to England; the command then\r\ndevolved upon Sir Henry Clinton.\r\n\r\nIn June, the British army left Philadelphia, and marched for New York.\r\nOn their march they were annoyed by the Americans; and at Monmouth, a\r\nvery regular action took place, between part of the armies; the enemy\r\nwere repulsed with great loss, and had General Lee obeyed his orders, a\r\nsignal victory must have been obtained. General Lee, for his ill conduct\r\nthat day, was suspended, and was never afterwards permitted to join the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee's conduct, at several times before this, had been very\r\nsuspicious. In December 1776, he lay at Chatham, about eleven miles from\r\nElizabeth Town, with a brigade of troops, when a great quantity of\r\nbaggage was stored at Elizabeth Town, under a guard of only five hundred\r\nHessians. General Lee was apprised of this, and might have surprised the\r\nguard and taken the baggage. But he neglected the opportunity, and after\r\nseveral marches and counter marches between Troy, Chatham and\r\nMorristown, he took up his quarters at or near White's tavern, where he\r\nwas surprised and taken prisoner by a party of the British horse. He was\r\nheard to say repeatedly, that General Washington would ruin a fine army.\r\nIt was suspected that he had designs to supplant the General, and his\r\nfriends attempted to place him at the head of the army. General\r\nWashington's prudent delays and cautious movements afforded General\r\nLee's friends many opportunities to spread reports unfavorable to his\r\ncharacter. It was insinuated, with some success, that General Washington\r\nwanted courage and abilities. Reports of this kind, at one time,\r\nrendered General Lee very popular, and it is supposed he wished to\r\nfrustrate General Washington's plans, in order to increase the\r\nsuspicions already entertained of his generalship, and turn the public\r\nclamor in his own favor. His conduct at Monmouth, must have proceeded\r\nfrom such a design; for he commanded the flower of the American army,\r\nand was not destitute of courage.\r\n\r\nIn August, General Sullivan, with a large body of troops, attempted to\r\ntake possession of Rhode Island, but did not succeed. Soon after, the\r\nstores and shipping at Bedford in Massachusetts, were burnt by a party\r\nof the British troops. The same year, Savannah, then the capital of\r\nGeorgia, was taken by the British, under the command of Colonel\r\nCampbell.\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1779) General Lincoln was appointed to the\r\ncommand of the southern army.\r\n\r\nGovernor Tryon and Sir George Collier made an incursion into\r\nConnecticut, and burnt, with wanton barbarity, the towns of Fairfield\r\nand Norwalk. But the American arms were crowned with success, in a bold\r\nattack upon Stoney Point, which was surprised and taken by General\r\nWayne, in the night of the 15th of July. Five hundred men were made\r\nprisoners, with little loss on either side.\r\n\r\nA party of British forces attempted this summer, to build a fort on\r\nPenobscot river, for the purpose of cutting timber in the neighboring\r\nforests. A plan was laid by Massachusetts, to dislodge them, and a\r\nconsiderable fleet collected for the purpose. But the plan failed of\r\nsuccess, and the whole marine force fell into the hands of the British,\r\nexcept some vessels which were burnt by the Americans themselves.\r\n\r\nIn October, General Lincoln and Count de Estaing made an assault upon\r\nSavannah; but they were repulsed with considerable loss. In this action,\r\nthe celebrated Polish Count Pulaski, who had acquired the reputation of\r\na brave soldier, was mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nIn this summer, General Sullivan marched with a body of troops, into the\r\nIndians' country, and burnt and destroyed all their provisions and\r\nsettlements that fell in their way.\r\n\r\nOn the opening of the campaign, the next year, (1780) the British troops\r\nleft Rhode Island. An expedition under General Clinton and Lord\r\nCornwallis, was undertaken against Charleston, South Carolina, where\r\nGeneral Lincoln commanded. This town, after a close siege of about six\r\nweeks, was surrendered to the British commander; and General Lincoln,\r\nand the whole American garrison were made prisoners.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gates was appointed to the command in the southern department,\r\nand another army collected. In August, Lord Cornwallis attacked the\r\nAmerican troops at Camden, in South Carolina, and routed them with\r\nconsiderable loss. He afterwards marched through the southern States,\r\nand supposed them entirely subdued.\r\n\r\nThe same summer, the British troops made frequent incursions from New\r\nYork into the Jersies; ravaging and plundering the country.\r\n\r\nIn July, a French fleet, under Monsieur d'Ternay, with a body of land\r\nforces, commanded by Count de Rochambeau, arrived at Rhode Island, to\r\nthe great joy of the Americans.\r\n\r\nThis year was also distinguished by the infamous treason of General\r\nArnold. General Washington having some business to transact at\r\nWethersfield, in Connecticut, left Arnold to command the important post\r\nof West Point; which guards a pass in Hudson's river, about sixty miles\r\nfrom New York. Arnold's conduct in the city of Philadelphia, the\r\npreceding winter, had been censured; and the treatment he received in\r\nconsequence, had given him offence.\r\n\r\nHe determined to take revenge; and for this purpose, he entered into a\r\nnegociation with Sir Henry Clinton, to deliver West Point, and the army,\r\ninto the hands of the British. While General Washington was absent, he\r\ndismounted the cannon in some of the forts, and took other steps to\r\nrender the taking of the post easy for the enemy.\r\n\r\nBut by a providential discovery, the whole plan was defeated. Major\r\nAndre, aid to General Clinton, a brave officer, who had been sent up the\r\nriver as a spy, to concert the plan of operations with Arnold, was\r\ntaken, condemned by a court martial, and executed. Arnold made his\r\nescape, by getting on board the Vulture, a British vessel, which lay in\r\nthe river. His conduct has stamped him with infamy; and, like all\r\ntraitors, he is despised by all mankind. General Washington arrived in\r\ncamp just after Arnold had made his escape, and restored order in the\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of General Gates in Carolina, General Greene was\r\nappointed to the command in the southern department. From this period,\r\nthings in that quarter wore a more favorable aspect. Colonel Tarleton,\r\nthe activ commander of the British legion, was defeated by General\r\nMorgan, the intrepid commander of the rifle men.\r\n\r\nAfter a variety of movements, the two armies met at Guilford, in\r\nCarolina. Here was one of the best fought actions during the war.\r\nGeneral Greene and Lord Cornwallis exerted themselves at the head of\r\ntheir respectiv armies; and although the Americans were obliged to\r\nretire from the field of battle, yet the British army suffered an\r\nimmense loss, and could not pursue the victory. This action happened on\r\nthe 15th March, 1781.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, Arnold the traitor, who was made a Brigadier General in\r\nthe British service, with a small number of troops, sailed for Virginia,\r\nand plundered the country. This called the attention of the French fleet\r\nto that quarter; and a naval engagement took place between the English\r\nand French, in which some of the English ships were much damaged, and\r\none entirely disabled.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Guilford, General Greene moved towards South\r\nCarolina, to drive the British from their posts in that State. Here Lord\r\nRawdon obtained an inconsiderable advantage over the Americans, near\r\nCamden. But General Greene more than recovered this advantage, by the\r\nbrilliant and successful action at the Eutaw Springs; where General\r\nMarian distinguished himself, and the brave Colonel Washington was\r\nwounded and taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nLord Cornwallis, finding General Greene successful in Carolina, marched\r\nto Virginia, collected his forces, and fortified himself in Yorktown. In\r\nthe mean time Arnold made an incursion into Connecticut, burnt a part of\r\nNew London, took Fort Griswold by storm, and put the garrison to the\r\nsword. The garrison consisted chiefly of men suddenly collected from the\r\nlittle town of Groton, which, by the savage cruelty of the British\r\nofficer who commanded the attack, lost, in one hour, almost all its\r\nheads of families. The brave Colonel Ledyard, who commanded the fort,\r\nwas slain with his own sword, after he had surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de la Fayette, the brave and generous nobleman, whose\r\nservices command the gratitude of every American, had been dispatched\r\nwith about two thousand light infantry, from the main army, to watch the\r\nmotions of lord Cornwallis in Virginia. He prosecuted this expedition\r\nwith the greatest military ability. Although his force was much inferior\r\nto that of the enemy, he obliged them to leave Richmond and\r\nWilliamsburgh, and to seek protection under their shipping.\r\n\r\nAbout the last of August, Count de Grasse arrived with a large fleet in\r\nthe Chesapeak, and blocked up the British troops at Yorktown. Admiral\r\nGreaves, with a British fleet, appeared off the Capes, and an action\r\nsucceeded; but it was not decisiv.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington had before this time moved the main body of his army,\r\ntogether with the French troops, to the southward; and as soon as he\r\nheard of the arrival of the French fleet in the Chesapeak, he made rapid\r\nmarches to the head of Elk, where embarking, the troops soon arrived at\r\nYorktown.\r\n\r\nA close siege immediately commenced, and was carried on with such vigor,\r\nby the combined forces of America and France, that lord Cornwallis was\r\nobliged to surrender. This glorious event which took place on the 19th\r\nof October, 1781, decided the contest in favor of America; and laid the\r\nfoundation of a general peace.[46]\r\n\r\n    [46] It has been controverted whether the capture of General\r\n    Cornwallis was the result of a plan preconcerted between\r\n    General Washington and Count de Grasse; or rather whether the\r\n    arrival of the Count in the Chesapeak was predetermined and\r\n    expected by General Washington, and consequently all the\r\n    preparations to attack New York a mere finesse to deceive the\r\n    enemy; or whether the real intention was against New York,\r\n    and the siege of Yorktown planned upon the unexpected arrival\r\n    of the French fleet in the bay. The following letter will let\r\n    the matter in its true light.\r\n\r\n              _Mount Vernon, July 31, 1788._\r\n\r\n         SIR,\r\n\r\n    I duly received your letter of the 14th instant, and can only\r\n    answer you briefly and generally from memory; that a combined\r\n    operation of the land and naval forces of France in America,\r\n    for the year 1781, was preconcerted the year before; that the\r\n    point of attack was not absolutely agreed upon,[b] because it\r\n    could not be foreknown where the enemy would be most\r\n    susceptible of impression; and because we (having the command\r\n    of the water with sufficient means of conveyance) could\r\n    transport ourselves to any spot with the greatest celerity;\r\n    that it was determined by me, nearly twelve months before\r\n    hand, at all hazards, to give out and cause it to be believed\r\n    by the highest military as well as civil officers, that New\r\n    York was the destined place of attack, for the important\r\n    purpose of inducing the eastern and middle States to make\r\n    greater exertions in furnishing specific supplies, than they\r\n    otherwise would have done, as well as for the interesting\r\n    purpose of rendering the enemy less prepared elsewhere; that\r\n    by these means, and these alone, artillery, boats, stores,\r\n    and provisions, were in seasonable preparation to move with\r\n    the utmost rapidity to any part of the continent; for the\r\n    difficulty consisted more in providing, than knowing how to\r\n    apply the military apparatus; that before the arrival of the\r\n    Count de Grasse, it was the fixed determination _to strike\r\n    the enemy in the most vulnerable quarter_, so as to ensure\r\n    success with moral certainty, as our affairs were then in the\r\n    most ruinous train imaginable; that New York was thought to\r\n    be beyond our effort, and consequently that the only\r\n    hesitation that remained, was between an attack upon the\r\n    British army in Virginia and that in Charleston: And finally,\r\n    that, by the intervention of several communications, and some\r\n    incidents which cannot be detailed in a letter, the hostile\r\n    post in Virginia, from being a _provisional and strongly\r\n    expected_, became the _definitiv and certain object_ of the\r\n    campaign.\r\n\r\n         [b] Because it would be easy for the Count de\r\n         Grasse, in good time before his departure from the\r\n         West Indies, to giv notice, by expressing at what\r\n         place he could most conveniently first touch to\r\n         receive advice.\r\n\r\n    I only add, that it never was in contemplation to attack New\r\n    York, unless the garrison should first have been so far\r\n    degarnished to carry on the southern operations, as to render\r\n    our success in the siege of that place, as infallible as any\r\n    future military event can ever be made. For I repeat it, and\r\n    dwell upon it again, some splendid advantage (whether upon a\r\n    larger or smaller scale was almost immaterial) was so\r\n    essentially necessary, to revive the expiring hopes and\r\n    languid exertions of the country, at the crisis in question,\r\n    that I never would have consented to embark in any\r\n    enterprise, wherein, from the most rational plan and accurate\r\n    calculations, the favorable issue should not have appeared as\r\n    clear to my view as a ray of light. The failure of an attempt\r\n    against the posts of the enemy, could, in no other possible\r\n    situation during the war, have been so fatal to our cause.\r\n\r\n    That much trouble was taken and finesse used to misguide and\r\n    bewilder Sir Henry Clinton, in regard to the real object, by\r\n    fictitious communications, as well as by making a deceptiv\r\n    provision of ovens, forage, and boats, in his neighborhood,\r\n    is certain: Nor were less pains taken to deceive our own\r\n    army; for I had always conceived, where the imposition did\r\n    not completely take place at home, it could never\r\n    sufficiently succeed abroad.\r\n\r\n    Your desire of obtaining truth, is very laudable; I wish I\r\n    had more leisure to gratify it, as I am equally solicitous\r\n    the undisguised verity should be known. Many circumstances\r\n    will unavoidably be misconceived and misrepresented.\r\n    Notwithstanding most of the papers, which may properly be\r\n    deemed official, are preserved; yet the knowlege of\r\n    innumerable things, of a more delicate and secret nature, is\r\n    confined to the perishable remembrance of some few of the\r\n    present generation.\r\n\r\n    With esteem, I am, Sir, your most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\n              G. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n    To ----.\r\n\r\nA few months after the surrender of Cornwallis, the British evacuated\r\nall their posts in South Carolina and Georgia, and retired to the main\r\narmy in New York.\r\n\r\nThe next spring, (1782) Sir Guy Carleton arrived in New York, and took\r\nthe command of the British army, in America. Immediately on his arrival,\r\nhe acquainted General Washington and Congress, that negociations for a\r\npeace had been commenced at Paris.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of November, 1782, the provisional articles of peace were\r\nsigned at Paris; by which Great Britain acknowleged the independence and\r\nsovereignty of the United States of America; and these articles were\r\nafterwards ratified by a definitiv treaty.\r\n\r\nThus ended a long and arduous conflict, in which Great Britain expended\r\nnear an hundred millions of money, with an hundred thousand lives, and\r\nwon nothing. America endured every cruelty and distress from her\r\nenemies; lost many lives and much treasure; but delivered herself from a\r\nforeign dominion, and gained a rank among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nHolland acknowleged the independence of the United States on the 19th of\r\nApril, 1782; Sweden, February 5th, 1783; Denmark, the 25th of February;\r\nSpain, in March, and Russia in July, 1783.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was peace restored by the definitiv treaty, and the British\r\ntroops withdrawn from the country, than the United States began to\r\nexperience the defects of their general government. While an enemy was\r\nin the country, fear, which had first impelled the colonies to associate\r\nin mutual defence, continued to operate as a band of political union. It\r\ngave to the resolutions and recommendations of Congress the force of\r\nlaws, and generally commanded a ready acquiescence on the part of the\r\nState legislatures. Articles of confederation and perpetual union had\r\nbeen framed in Congress, and submitted to the consideration of the\r\nStates, in the year 1778. Some of the States immediately acceded to\r\nthem; but others, which had not unappropriated lands, hesitated to\r\nsubscribe a compact, which would giv an advantage to the States which\r\npossessed large tracts of unlocated lands, and were thus capable of a\r\ngreat superiority in wealth and population. All objections however had\r\nbeen overcome, and by the accession of Maryland in March, 1781, the\r\narticles of confederation were ratified, as the frame of government for\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThese articles, however were framed during the rage of war, when a\r\nprinciple of common safety supplied the place of a coerciv power in\r\ngovernment; by men who could have had no experience in the art of\r\ngoverning an extensiv country, and under circumstances the most critical\r\nand embarrassing. To have offered to the people at that time, a system\r\nof government armed with the powers necessary to regulate and control\r\nthe contending interests of thirteen States, and the possessions of\r\nmillions of people, might have raised a jealousy between the States or\r\nin the minds of the people at large, that would have weakened the\r\noperations of war, and perhaps have rendered a union impracticable.\r\nHence the numerous defects of the confederation.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of peace, these defects began to be felt. Each State\r\nassumed the right of disputing the propriety of the resolutions of\r\nCongress, and the interest of an individual State was placed in\r\nopposition to the common interest of the union. In addition to this\r\nsource of division, a jealousy of the powers of Congress began to be\r\nexcited in the minds of people.\r\n\r\nThis jealousy of the privileges of freemen, had been roused by the\r\noppressiv acts of the British parliament; and no sooner had the danger\r\nfrom this quarter ceased, than the fears of people changed their object,\r\nand were turned against their own rulers.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, there were not wanting men of industry and talents,\r\nwho had been enemies to the revolution, and who embraced the opportunity\r\nto multiply the apprehensions of people and increase the popular\r\ndiscontents. A remarkable instance of this happened in Connecticut. As\r\nsoon as the tumults of war had subsided, an attempt was made to convince\r\nthe people, that the act of Congress passed in 1778, granting to the\r\nofficers of the army, half pay for life, was highly unjust and\r\ntyrannical; and that it was but the first step towards the establishment\r\nof pensions and an uncontrolable despotism. The act of Congress, passed\r\nin 1783, commuting half pay for life for five years full pay, was\r\ndesigned to appease the apprehensions of people, and to convince them\r\nthat this gratuity was intended merely to indemnify the officers for\r\ntheir losses by the depreciation of the paper currency; and not to\r\nestablish a precedent for the granting of pensions. This act, however,\r\ndid not satisfy the people, who supposed that the officers had been\r\ngenerally indemnified for the loss of their pay, by the grants made them\r\nfrom time to time by the legislatures of the several States. Besides the\r\nact, while it gave five years full pay to the officers, allowed but one\r\nyear's pay to the privates; a distinction which had great influence in\r\nexciting and continuing the popular ferment, and one that turned a large\r\nshare of the public rage against the officers themselves.\r\n\r\nThe moment an alarm was raised respecting this act of Congress, the\r\nenemies of our independence became activ in blowing up the flame, by\r\nspreading reports unfavorable to the general government, and tending to\r\ncreate public dissensions. Newspapers, in some parts of the country,\r\nwere filled with inflammatory publications; while false reports and\r\ngroundless insinuations were industriously circulated to the prejudice\r\nof Congress and the officers of the late army. Among a people feelingly\r\nalive to every thing that could affect the rights for which they had\r\nbeen contending, these reports could not fail of having a powerful\r\neffect; the clamor soon became general; the officers of the army, it was\r\nbelieved, had attempted to raise their fortunes on the distresses of\r\ntheir fellow citizens, and Congress become the tyrants of their country.\r\n\r\nConnecticut was the seat of this uneasiness; altho other States were\r\nmuch agitated on the occasion. But the inhabitants of that State,\r\naccustomed to order and a due subordination to the laws, did not proceed\r\nto outrages; they took their usual mode of collecting the sense of the\r\nState; assembled in town meetings; appointed committees to meet in\r\nconvention, and consult what measures should be adopted to procure a\r\nredress of their grievances. In this convention, which was held at\r\nMiddletown, some nugatory resolves were passed, exploiting a\r\ndisapprobation of the half pay act, and the subsequent commutation of\r\nthe grant for five years whole pay. The same spirit also discovered\r\nitself in the assembly, at their October session, in 1783. A\r\nremonstrance against the acts in favor of the officers, was framed in\r\nthe house of representativs, and notwithstanding the upper house refused\r\nto concur in the measure, it was sent to Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring this situation of affairs, the public odium against the officers,\r\nwas augmented by another circumstance. The officers, just before the\r\ndisbanding of the army, had formed a society, called by the name of the\r\n_Cincinnati_, after the Roman Dictator, Cincinnatus, which, it was said,\r\nwas intended to perpetuate the memory of the revolution, the friendship\r\nof the officers, and the union of the States; and also to raise a fund\r\nfor the relief of poor widows and orphans, whose husbands and fathers\r\nhad fallen during the war, and for their descendants. The society was\r\ndivided into State societies, which were to meet on the 4th of July, and\r\nwith other business, depute a number of their members to convene\r\nannually in general meeting. The members of the institution were to be\r\ndistinguished by wearing a medal, emblematical of the design of the\r\nsociety, and the honors and advantages were to be hereditary in the\r\neldest male heirs, and in default of male issue, in the collateral male\r\nheirs. Honorary members were to be admitted, but without the hereditary\r\nadvantages of the society, and provided their number would never exceed\r\nthe ratio of one to four of the officers or their descendants.\r\n\r\nWhatever were the real views of the framers of this institution, its\r\ndesign was generally understood to be harmless and honorable. The\r\nostensible views of the society could not however skreen it from popular\r\njealousy. A spirited pamphlet appeared in South Carolina, the avowed\r\nproduction of Mr. Burke, one of the judges of the supreme court in that\r\nState, in which the author attempted to prove that the principles, on\r\nwhich the society was formed, would, in process of time, originate and\r\nestablish an order of nobility in this country, which would be repugnant\r\nto the genius of our republican governments, and dangerous to liberty.\r\nThis pamphlet appeared in Connecticut, during the commotions raised by\r\nthe half pay and commutation acts, and contributed not a little to\r\nspread the flame of opposition. Nothing could exceed the odium which\r\nprevailed at this time, against the men who had hazarded their persons\r\nand properties in the revolution.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the discontents of the people were general, and ready to\r\nburst forth in sedition, yet men of information, viz. the officers of\r\ngovernment, the clergy, and persons of liberal education, were mostly\r\nopposed to the unconstitutional steps taken by the committees and\r\nconvention at Middletown. They supported the propriety of the measures\r\nof Congress, both by conversation and writing, proved that such grants\r\nto the army were necessary to keep the troops together, and that the\r\nexpense would not be enormous nor oppressiv. During the close of the\r\nyear 1783, every possible exertion was made to enlighten the people, and\r\nsuch was the effect of the arguments used by the minority, that in the\r\nbeginning of the following year, the opposition subsided, the committees\r\nwere dismissed, and tranquillity restored to the State. In May, the\r\nlegislature were able to carry several measures which had before been\r\nextremely unpopular. An act was passed, granting the import of five per\r\ncent. to Congress; another giving great encouragement to commerce, and\r\nseveral towns were incorporated with extensiv privileges, for the\r\npurpose of regulating the exports of the State, and facilitating the\r\ncollection of debts.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the Congressional acts in favor of the officers, and\r\nto the order of the Cincinnati, did not rise to the same pitch in the\r\nother States as in Connecticut; yet it produced much disturbance in\r\nMassachusetts, and some others. Jealousy of power had been universally\r\nspread among the people of the United States. The destruction of the old\r\nforms of governments, and the licentiousness of war had, in a great\r\nmeasure, broken their habits of obedience; their passions had been\r\ninflamed by the cry of despotism; and like centinels, who have been\r\nsuddenly surprised by the approach of an enemy, the rustling of a leaf\r\nwas sufficient to giv them an alarm. This spirit of jealousy, which has\r\nnot yet subsided, and which will probably continue visible during the\r\npresent generation, operated with other causes to relax the energy of\r\nour federal operations.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, vast sums of paper currency had been emitted by\r\nCongress, and large quantities of specie had been introduced, towards\r\nthe close of the war, by the French army, and the Spanish trade. This\r\nplenty of money enabled the States to comply with the first requisitions\r\nof Congress; so that during two or three years, the federal treasury\r\nwas, in some measure, supplied. But when the danger of war had ceased,\r\nand the vast importations of foreign goods had lessened the quantity of\r\ncirculating specie, the States began to be very remiss in furnishing\r\ntheir proportion of monies. The annihilation of the credit of the paper\r\nbills had totally stopped their circulation, and the specie was leaving\r\nthe country in cargoes, for remittances to Great Britain; still the\r\nluxurious habits of the people, contracted during the war, called for\r\nnew supplies of goods, and private gratification seconded the narrow\r\npolicy of State interest in defeating the operations of the general\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThus the revenues of Congress were annually diminishing; some of the\r\nStates wholly neglecting to make provision for paying the interest of\r\nthe national debt; others making but a partial provision, until the\r\nscanty supplies received from a few of the rich States, would hardly\r\nsatisfy the demands of the civil list.\r\n\r\nThis weakness of the federal government, in conjunction with the flood\r\nof certificates or public securities, which Congress could neither fund\r\nnor pay, occasioned them to depreciate to a very inconsiderable value.\r\nThe officers and soldiers of the late army were obliged to receive for\r\nwages these certificates, or promissary notes, which passed at a fifth,\r\nor eighth, or a tenth of their nominal value; being thus deprived at\r\nonce of the greatest part of the reward due for their services. Some\r\nindeed profited by speculations in these evidences of the public debt;\r\nbut such as were under a necessity of parting with them, were robbed of\r\nthat support which they had a right to expect and demand from their\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nPensylvania indeed made provision for paying the interest of her debts,\r\nboth State and federal; assuming her supposed proportion of the\r\ncontinental debt, and giving the creditors her own State notes in\r\nexchange for those of the United States. The resources of that State are\r\nimmense, but she has not been able to make punctual payments, even in a\r\ndepreciated paper currency.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts, in her zeal to comply fully with the requisitions of\r\nCongress, and satisfy the demands of her own creditors, laid a heavy\r\ntax upon the people. This was the immediate cause of the rebellion in\r\nthat State, in 1786. But a heavy debt lying on the State, added to\r\nburdens of the same nature, upon almost every incorporation within it; a\r\ndecline, or rather an extinction of public credit; a relaxation and\r\ncorruption of manners, and a free use of foreign luxuries; a decay of\r\ntrade and manufactures, with a prevailing scarcity of money; and, above\r\nall, individuals involved in debt to each other: These were the real,\r\nthough more remote causes of the insurrection. It was the tax which the\r\npeople were required to pay, that caused them to feel evils which we\r\nhave enumerated: This called forth all their other grievances; and the\r\nfirst act of violence committed, was the burning or destroying of a tax\r\nbill. This sedition threw the State into a convulsion which lasted about\r\na year; courts of justice were violently obstructed; the collection of\r\ndebts was suspended; and a body of armed troops, under the command of\r\nGeneral Lincoln, was employed during the winter of 1786, to disperse the\r\ninsurgents. Yet so numerous were the latter in the counties of\r\nWorcester, Hampshire and Berkshire, and so obstinately combined to\r\noppose the execution of law by force, that the Governor and Council of\r\nthe State thought proper not to intrust General Lincoln with military\r\npowers, except to act on the defensiv, and to repel force with force, in\r\ncase the insurgents should attack him. The leaders of the rebels however\r\nwere not men of talents; they were desperate, but without fortitude; and\r\nwhile they were supported with a superior force, they appeared to be\r\nimpressed with that consciousness of guilt, which awes the most daring\r\nwretch, and makes him shrink from his purpose. This appears by the\r\nconduct of a large party of the rebels before the magazine at\r\nSpringfield; where General Shepard with a small guard, was stationed to\r\nprotect the continental stores. The insurgents appeared upon the plain,\r\nwith a vast superiority of numbers, but a few shot from the artillery\r\nmade the multitude retreat in disorder, with the loss of four men. This\r\nspirited conduct of General Shepard, with the industry, perseverance\r\nand prudent firmness of General Lincoln, dispersed the rebels, drove the\r\nleaders from the State, and restored tranquillity. An act of indemnity\r\nwas passed in the Legislature for all the insurgents, except a few\r\nleaders, on condition they should become peaceable subjects, and take\r\nthe oath of allegiance. The leaders afterwards petitioned for pardon,\r\nwhich, from motivs of policy, was granted by the Legislature.\r\n\r\nBut the loss of public credit, popular disturbances, and insurrections,\r\nwere not the only evils which were generated by the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of the times. The emissions of bills of credit and tender\r\nlaws, were added to the black catalogue of political disorders.\r\n\r\nThe expedient of supplying the deficiencies of specie, by emissions of\r\npaper bills, was adopted very early in the colonies. The expedient was\r\nobvious and produced good effects. In a new country, where population is\r\nrapid, and the value of lands increasing, the farmer finds an advantage\r\nin paying legal interest for money; for if he can pay the interest by\r\nhis profits, the increasing value of his lands will, in a few years,\r\ndischarge the principal.\r\n\r\nIn no colony was this advantage more sensibly experienced than in\r\nPensylvania. The emigrants to that province were numerous; the natural\r\npopulation rapid; and these circumstances combined, advanced the value\r\nof real property to an astonishing degree. As the first settlers there,\r\nas well as in other provinces, were poor, the purchase of a few foreign\r\narticles drained them of specie. Indeed for many years, the balance of\r\ntrade must have necessarily been greatly against the colonies.\r\n\r\nBut bills of credit, emitted by the State and loaned to the industrious\r\ninhabitants, supplied the want of specie, and enabled the farmer to\r\npurchase stock. These bills were generally a legal tender in all\r\ncolonial or private contracts, and the sums issued did not generally\r\nexceed the quantity requisit for a medium of trade; they retained their\r\nfull nominal value in the purchase of commodities. But as they were not\r\nreceived by the British merchants, in payment for goods, there was a\r\ngreat demand for specie and bills, which occasioned the latter at\r\nvarious times to appreciate. Thus was introduced a difference between\r\nthe English sterling money and the currencies of the colonies which\r\nremains to this day.[47]\r\n\r\n    [47] A dollar, in sterling money, is 4_s_6. But the price of\r\n    a dollar rose in New England currency to 6_s_; in New York to\r\n    8_s_; in New Jersey, Pensylvania and Maryland to 7_s_6; in\r\n    Virginia to 6_s_; in North Carolina to 8_s_; in South\r\n    Carolina and Georgia to 4_s_8. This difference, originating\r\n    between paper and specie, or bills, continued afterwards to\r\n    exist in the nominal estimation of gold and silver.\r\n\r\n              _Franklin's Miscel. Works, p. 217._\r\n\r\nThe advantages the colonies had derived from bills of credit, under the\r\nBritish government, suggested to Congress, in 1775, the idea of issuing\r\nbills for the purpose of carrying on the war. And this was perhaps their\r\nonly expedient. Money could not be raised by taxation; it could not be\r\nborrowed. The first emissions had no other effect upon the medium of\r\ncommerce, than to drive the specie from circulation. But when the paper\r\nsubstituted for specie, had, by repeated millions, augmented the sum in\r\ncirculation, much beyond the usual sum of specie, the bills began to\r\nlose their value. The depreciation continued in proportion to the sums\r\nemitted, until seventy, and even one hundred and fifty nominal paper\r\ndollars, were hardly an equivalent for one Spanish milled dollar. Still\r\nfrom the year 1775 to 1781, this depreciating paper currency was almost\r\nthe only medium of trade. It supplied the place of specie, and enabled\r\nCongress to support a numerous army; until the sum in circulation\r\namounted to two hundred millions of dollars. But about the year 1780,\r\nspecie began to be plentiful, being introduced by the French army, a\r\nprivate trade with the Spanish islands, and an illicit intercourse with\r\nthe British garrison at New York. This circumstance accelerated the\r\ndepreciation of the paper bills, until their value had sunk almost to\r\nnothing. In 1781, the merchants and brokers in the southern States,\r\napprehensiv of the approaching fate of the currency, pushed immense\r\nquantities of it suddenly into New England, made vast purchases of goods\r\nin Boston, and instantly the bills vanished from circulation.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of this continental paper is a history of public and\r\nprivate frauds. Old specie debts were often paid in a depreciated\r\ncurrency, and even new contracts for a few weeks or days were often\r\ndischarged with a small part of the value received. From this plenty and\r\nfluctuating state of the medium, sprung hosts of speculators and\r\nitinerant traders, who left their honest occupations for the prospect of\r\nimmense gains, in a fraudulent business, that depended on no fixed\r\nprinciples, and the profits of which could be reduced to no certain\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nTo increase these evils, a project was formed to fix the prices of\r\narticles, and restrain persons from giving or receiving more for any\r\ncommodity than the price stated by authority. These regulating acts were\r\nreprobated by every man acquainted with commerce and finance; as they\r\nwere intended to prevent an effect without removing the cause. To\r\nattempt to fix the value of money, while streams of bills were\r\nincessantly flowing from the treasury of the United States, was as\r\nridiculous as an attempt to restrain the rising of water in rivers\r\namidst showers of rain.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all opposition, some States framed and attempted to\r\nenforce these regulating acts. The effect was, a momentary apparent\r\nstand in the price of articles; innumerable acts of collusion and\r\nevasion among the dishonest; numberless injuries done to the honest; and\r\nfinally a total disregard of all such regulations, and the consequential\r\ncontempt of laws and the authority of the magistrate.\r\n\r\nDuring these fluctuations of business, occasioned by the variable value\r\nof money, people lost sight, in some measure, of the steady principles\r\nwhich had before governed their intercourse with each other.\r\nSpeculations followed and relaxed the rigor of commercial obligations.\r\n\r\nIndustry likewise had suffered by the flood of money which had deluged\r\nthe States. The prices of produce had risen in proportion to the\r\nquantity of money in circulation, and the demand for the commodities of\r\nthe country. This made the acquisition of money easy, and indolence and\r\nluxury, with their train of desolating consequences, spread themselves\r\namong all descriptions of people.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as hostilities between Great Britain and America were\r\nsuspended, the scene was changed. The bills emitted by Congress had long\r\nbefore ceased to circulate; and the specie of the country was soon\r\ndrained off to pay for foreign goods, the importations of which exceeded\r\nall calculation. Within two years from the close of the war, _a scarcity\r\nof money_ was the general cry. The merchants found it impossible to\r\ncollect their debts, and make punctual remittances to their creditors in\r\nGreat Britain; and the consumers were driven to the necessity of\r\nretrenching their superfluities in living and of returning to their\r\nancient habits of industry and economy.\r\n\r\nThis change was however progressiv and slow. In many of the States which\r\nsuffered by the numerous debts they had contracted, and by the\r\ndistresses of war, the people called aloud for emissions of paper bills\r\nto supply the deficiency of a medium. The depreciation of the\r\ncontinental bills, was a recent example of the ill effects of such an\r\nexpedient, and the impossibility of supporting the credit of paper, was\r\nurged by the opposers of the measure as a substantial argument against\r\nadopting it. But nothing would silence the popular clamor; and many men\r\nof the first talents and eminence, united their voices with that of the\r\npopulace. Paper money had formerly maintained its credit, and been of\r\nsingular utility; and past experience, notwithstanding a change of\r\ncircumstances, was an argument in its favor that bore down all\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nPensylvania, although one of the richest States in the union, was the\r\nfirst to emit bills of credit, as a substitute for specie. But the\r\nrevolution had removed the necessity of it, at the same time that it\r\nhad destroyed the means by which its former credit had been supported.\r\nLands, at the close of the war, were not rising in value; bills on\r\nLondon could not so readily be purchased, as while the province was\r\ndependent on Great Britain; the State was split into parties, one of\r\nwhich attempted to defeat the measures most popular with the other; and\r\nthe depreciation of continental bills, with the injuries which it had\r\ndone to individuals, inspired a general distrust of all public promises.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding a part of the money was loaned on good landed security,\r\nand the faith of that wealthy State pledged for the redemption of the\r\nwhole at its nominal value, yet the advantages of specie as a medium of\r\ncommerce, especially as an article of remittance to London, soon made a\r\ndifference of ten per cent. between the bills of credit and specie. This\r\ndifference may be considered rather as an appreciation of gold and\r\nsilver, than a depreciation of paper; but its effects, in a commercial\r\nState, must be highly prejudicial. It opens the door to frauds of all\r\nkinds, and frauds are usually practised on the honest and unsuspecting,\r\nespecially upon all classes of laborers.\r\n\r\nThis currency of Pensylvania is receivable in all payments at the custom\r\nhouse, and for certain taxes, at its nominal value; yet it has sunk to\r\ntwo thirds of this value, in the few commercial transactions where it is\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, had recourse to the same\r\nwretched expedient to supply themselves with money; not reflecting that\r\nindustry, frugality, and good commercial laws are the only means of\r\nturning the balance of trade in favor of a country, and that this\r\nbalance is the only permanent source of solid wealth and ready money.\r\nBut the bills they emitted shared a worse fate than those of\r\nPensylvania; they expelled almost all the circulating cash from the\r\nStates; they lost a great part of their nominal value; they impoverished\r\nthe merchants, and embarrassed the planters.\r\n\r\nThe State of Virginia had too much wisdom to emit bills; but tolerated a\r\npractice among the inhabitants of cutting dollars and smaller pieces of\r\nsilver, in order to prevent it from leaving the State. This pernicious\r\npractice prevailed also in Georgia.[48]\r\n\r\n    [48] A dollar was usually cut in five pieces, and each passed\r\n    by toll for a quarter; so that the man who cut it gained a\r\n    quarter, or rather a fifth. If the State should recoin this\r\n    silver, it must lose a fifth.\r\n\r\nMaryland escaped the calamity of a paper currency. The house of\r\ndelegates brought forward a bill for the emission of bills of credit to\r\na large amount; but the senate firmly and successfully resisted the\r\npernicious scheme. The opposition between the two houses was violent and\r\ntumultuous; it threatened the State with anarchy; but the question was\r\ncarried to the people, and the good sense of the senate finally\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey is situated between two or the largest commercial towns in\r\nAmerica, and consequently drained of specie. This State also emitted a\r\nlarge sum in bills of credit, which served to pay the interest of the\r\npublic debt; but the currency depreciated, as in other States.\r\n\r\nRhode Island exhibits a melancholy proof of that licentiousness and\r\nanarchy which always follows a relaxation of the moral principles. In a\r\nrage for supplying the State with money, and filling every man's pocket\r\nwithout obliging him to earn it by his diligence, the Legislature passed\r\nan act for making one hundred thousand pounds in bills; a sum much more\r\nthan sufficient for a medium of trade in that State, even without any\r\nspecie. The merchants in Newport and Providence opposed the act with\r\nfirmness; their opposition added fresh vigour to the resolution of the\r\nassembly, and induced them to inforce the scheme by a legal lender of a\r\nmost extraordinary nature. They passed an act, ordaining that if any\r\ncreditor should refuse to take their bills, for any debt whatever, the\r\ndebtor might lodge the sum due, with a justice of the peace, who should\r\ngiv notice of it in the public papers; and if the creditor did not\r\nappear and receive the money within six months from the first notice,\r\nhis debt should be forfeited. This act astonished all honest men, and\r\neven the promoters of paper money making in other States, and on other\r\nprinciples, reprobated this act of Rhode Island, as wicked and\r\noppressiv. But the State was governed by faction. During the cry for\r\npaper money, a number of boisterous ignorant men, were elected into the\r\nLegislature, from the smaller towns in the State. Finding themselves\r\nunited with a majority in opinion, they formed and executed any plan\r\ntheir inclination suggested; they opposed every measure that was\r\nagreeable to the mercantile interest; they not only made bad laws to\r\nsuit their own wicked purposes, but appointed their own corrupt\r\ncreatures to fill the judicial and executiv departments. Their money\r\ndepreciated sufficiently to answer all their vile purposes in the\r\ndischarge of debts; business almost totally ceased; all confidence was\r\nlost; the State was thrown into confusion at home, and was execrated\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts Bay had the good fortune, amidst her political calamities,\r\nto prevent an emission of bills of credit. New Hampshire made no paper;\r\nbut in the distresses which followed her loss of business after the war,\r\nthe Legislature made horses, lumber, and most articles of produce a\r\nlegal tender in the fulfilment of contracts. It is doubtless unjust to\r\noblige a creditor to receive any thing for his debt, which he had not in\r\ncontemplation at the time of the contract. But as the commodities which\r\nwere to be a tender by the law of New Hampshire, were of an intrinsic\r\nvalue, bearing some proportion to the amount of the debt, the injustice\r\nof the law was less flagrant, than that which enforced the tender of\r\npaper in Rhode Island. Indeed a similar law prevailed for some time in\r\nMassachusetts; and in Connecticut it is optional with the creditor,\r\neither to imprison the debtor, or take land on an execution, at a price\r\nto be fixed by three indifferent freeholders; provided no other means of\r\npayment shall appear to satisfy the demand. It must not however be\r\nomitted, that while the most flourishing commercial States introduced a\r\npaper medium, to the great injury of honest men, a bill for an emission\r\nof paper in Connecticut, where there is very little specie, could never\r\ncommand more than one eighth of the votes of the Legislature. The movers\r\nof the bill have hardly escaped ridicule; so generally is the measure\r\nreprobated as a source of fraud and public mischief.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of New York, a State that had the least necessity and\r\napology for making paper money, as her commercial advantages always\r\nfurnish her with specie sufficient for a medium, issued a large sum in\r\nbills of credit, which support their value better than the currency of\r\nany other State. Still the paper has raised the value of specie, which\r\nis always in demand for exportation, and this difference of exchange\r\nbetween paper and specie, exposes commerce to most of the\r\ninconveniencies resulting from a depreciated medium.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of paper money thus far; a miserable substitute for\r\nreal coin, in a country where the reins of government are too weak to\r\ncompel the fulfilment of public engagements; and where all confidence in\r\npublic faith is totally destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhile the States were thus endeavoring to repair the loss of specie, by\r\nempty promises, and to support their business by shadows, rather than by\r\nreality, the British ministry formed some commercial regulations that\r\ndeprived them of the profits of their trade to the West Indies and to\r\nGreat Britain. Heavy duties were laid upon such articles as were\r\nremitted to the London merchants for their goods, and such were the\r\nduties upon American bottoms, that the States were almost wholly\r\ndeprived of the carrying trade. A prohibition was laid upon the produce\r\nof the United States, shipped to the English West India Islands in\r\nAmerican built vessels, and in those manned by American seamen. These\r\nrestrictions fell heavy upon the eastern States, which depended much\r\nupon ship building for the support of their trade; and they materially\r\ninjured the business of the other States.\r\n\r\nWithout a union that was able to form and execute a general system of\r\ncommercial regulations, some of the States attempted to impose\r\nrestraints upon the British trade that should indemnify the merchant for\r\nthe losses he had suffered, or induce the British ministry to enter into\r\na commercial treaty, and relax the rigor of their navigation laws. These\r\nmeasures however produced nothing but mischief. The States did not act\r\nin concert, and the restraints laid on the trade of one State operated\r\nto throw the business into the hands of its neighbor. Massachusetts, in\r\nher zeal to counteract the effect of the English navigation laws, laid\r\nenormous duties upon British goods imported into that State; but the\r\nother States did not adopt a similar measure; and the loss of business\r\nsoon obliged that State to repeal or suspend the law. Thus when\r\nPensylvania laid heavy duties on British goods, Delaware and New Jersey\r\nmade a number of free ports to encourage the landing of goods within the\r\nlimits of those States; and the duties in Pensylvania served no purpose,\r\nbut to create smuggling.\r\n\r\nThus divided, the States began to feel their weakness. Most of the\r\nLegislatures had neglected to comply with the requisitions of Congress\r\nfor furnishing the federal treasury; the resolves of Congress were\r\ndisregarded; the proposition for a general import to be laid and\r\ncollected by Congress was negatived first by Rhode Island, and\r\nafterwards by New York. The British troops continued, under pretence of\r\na breach of treaty on the part of America, to hold possession of the\r\nforts on the frontiers of the States, and thus commanded the fur trade.\r\nMany of the States individually were infested with popular commotions or\r\niniquitous tender laws, while they were oppressed with public debts; the\r\ncertificates or public notes had lost most of their value, and\r\ncirculated merely as the objects of speculation; Congress lost their\r\nrespectability, and the United States their credit and importance.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these calamities, a proposition was made in 1785, in the\r\nhouse of delegates, in Virginia, to appoint commissioners, to meet such\r\nas might be appointed in the other States, who should form a system of\r\ncommercial regulations for the United States, and recommend it to the\r\nseveral Legislatures for adoption. Commissioners were accordingly\r\nappointed and a request was made to the Legislatures of the other States\r\nto accede to the proposition. Accordingly several of the States\r\nappointed commissioners, who met at Annapolis in the summer of 1786, to\r\nconsult what measures should be taken to unite the States in some\r\ngeneral and efficient commercial system. But as the States were not all\r\nrepresented, and the powers of the commissioners were, in their opinion,\r\ntoo limited to propose a system of regulations adequate to the purposes\r\nof government, they agreed to recommend a general convention to be held\r\nat Philadelphia the next year, with powers to frame a general plan of\r\ngovernment for the United States. This measure appeared to the\r\ncommissioners absolutely necessary. The old confederation was\r\nessentially defectiv. It was destitute of almost every principle\r\nnecessary to giv effect to legislation.\r\n\r\nIt was defectiv in the article of legislating over States, instead of\r\nindividuals. All history testifies that recommendations will not operate\r\nas laws, and compulsion cannot be exercised over States, without\r\nviolence, war and anarchy. The confederation was also destitute of a\r\nsanction to its laws. When resolutions were passed in Congress, there\r\nwas no power to compel obedience by fine, by suspension of privileges or\r\nother means. It was also destitute of a guarantee for the State\r\ngovernments. Had one State been invaded by its neighbor, the union was\r\nnot constitutionally bound to assist in repelling the invasion, and\r\nsupporting the constitution of the invaded State. The confederation was\r\nfurther deficient in the principle of apportioning the quotas of money\r\nto be furnished by each State; in a want of power to form commercial\r\nlaws, and to raise troops for the defence and security of the union; in\r\nthe equal suffrage of the States, which placed Rhode Island on a\r\nfooting in Congress with Virginia; and to crown all the defects, we may\r\nadd the want of a judiciary power, to define the laws of the union, and\r\nto reconcile the contradictory decisions of a number of independent\r\njudicatories.\r\n\r\nThese and many inferior defects were obvious to the commissioners, and\r\ntherefore they urged a general convention, with powers to form and offer\r\nto the consideration of the States, a system of general government that\r\nshould be less exceptionable. Accordingly in May, 1787, delegates from\r\nall the States, except Rhode Island, assembled at Philadelphia; and\r\nchose General Washington for their president. After four months\r\ndeliberation, in which the clashing interests of the several States,\r\nappeared in all their force, the convention agreed to recommend a plan\r\nof federal government, &c.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plan of the federal constitution was submitted to the\r\nLegislatures of the several States, they proceeded to take measures for\r\ncollecting the sense of the people upon the propriety of adopting it. In\r\nthe small State of Delaware, a convention was called in November, which,\r\nafter a few days deliberation, ratified the constitution, without a\r\ndissenting voice.\r\n\r\nIn the convention of Pensylvania, held the same month, there was a\r\nspirited opposition to the new form of government. The debates were long\r\nand interesting. Great abilities and firmness were displayed on both\r\nsides; but, on the 13th of December, the constitution was received by\r\ntwo thirds of the members. The minority were dissatisfied, and with an\r\nobstinacy that ill became the representativs of a free people, published\r\ntheir reasons of dissent, which were calculated to inflame a party\r\nalready violent, and which, in fact, produced some disturbances in the\r\nwestern parts of the State. But the opposition has since subsided.\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey, the convention which met in December, were unanimous in\r\nadopting the constitution; as was likewise that of Georgia.\r\n\r\nIn Connecticut there was some opposition; but the constitution was, on\r\nthe 9th of January, 1788, ratified by three fourths of the votes in\r\nconvention, and the minority peaceably acquiesced in the decision.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, the opposition was large and respectable. The\r\nconvention, consisting of more than three hundred delegates, were\r\nassembled in January, and continued their debates, with great candor and\r\nliberality, about five weeks. At length the question was carried for the\r\nconstitution by a small majority, and the minority, with that manly\r\ncondescension which becomes great minds, submitted to the measure, and\r\nunited to support the government.\r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire, the federal cause was, for some time doubtful. The\r\ngreatest number of the delegates in convention, were at first on the\r\nside of the opposition; and some, who might have had their objections\r\nremoved by the discussion of the subject, instructed to reject the\r\nconstitution. Altho the instructions of constituents cannot, on the true\r\nprinciples of representation, be binding upon a deputy, in any\r\nlegislativ assembly, because his constituents are but a _part_ of the\r\nState, and have not heard the arguments and objections of the _whole_;\r\nwhereas, his act is to affect the _whole_ State, and therefore is to be\r\ndirected by the sense or wisdom of the whole, collected in the\r\nlegislativ assembly; yet the delegates in the New Hampshire convention\r\nconceived, very erroneously, that the sense of the freemen in the towns,\r\nthose little districts, where no act of legislation can be performed,\r\nimposed a restraint upon their own wills.[49] An adjournment was\r\ntherefore moved, and carried. This gave the people opportunity to gain a\r\nfarther knowlege of the merits of the constitution, and at the second\r\nmeeting of the convention, it was ratified by a respectable majority.\r\n\r\n    [49] This pernicious opinion has prevailed in all the States,\r\n    and done infinit mischief.\r\n\r\nIn Maryland, several men of abilities appeared in the opposition, and\r\nwere unremitted in their endeavors to persuade the people, that the\r\nproposed plan of government was artfully calculated to deprive them of\r\ntheir dearest rights; yet in convention it appeared that five sixths of\r\nthe voices were in favor of it.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, the opposition was respectable; but two thirds of the\r\nconvention appeared to advocate and vote for the constitution.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, many of the principal characters opposed the ratification\r\nof the constitution with great abilities and industry. But after a full\r\ndiscussion of the subject, a small majority, of a numerous convention,\r\nappeared for its adoption.\r\n\r\nIn New York, two thirds of the delegates in convention were, at their\r\nfirst meeting, determined to reject the constitution. Here, therefore,\r\nthe debates were the most interesting, and the event extremely doubtful.\r\nThe argument was managed with uncommon address and abilities on both\r\nsides of the question. But during the session, the ninth and tenth\r\nStates had acceded to the proposed plan, so that by the constitution,\r\nCongress were empowered to issue an ordinance for organizing the new\r\ngovernment. This event placed the opposition on new ground; and the\r\nexpediency of uniting with the other States; the generous motivs of\r\nconciliating all differences, and the danger of a rejection, influenced\r\na respectable number, who were originally opposed to the constitution,\r\nto join the federal interest. The constitution was accordingly ratified\r\nby a small majority; but the ratification was accompanied here, as in\r\nVirginia, with a bill of rights, declaratory of the sense of the\r\nconvention, as to certain great principles, and with a catalogue of\r\namendments, which were to be recommended to the consideration of the new\r\nCongress, and the several State Legislatures.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina met in convention in July, to deliberate on the new\r\nconstitution. After a short session they rejected it, by a majority of\r\none hundred and seventy six, against seventy six.\r\n\r\nRhode Island was doomed to be the sport of a blind and singular policy.\r\nThe Legislature, in consistency with the measures which had been before\r\npursued, did not call a convention, to collect the sense of the State\r\nupon the proposed constitution; but in an unconstitutional and absurd\r\nmanner, submitted the plan of government to the consideration of the\r\npeople. Accordingly it was brought before town meetings, and in most of\r\nthem rejected. In some of the large towns, particularly in Newport and\r\nProvidence, the people collected and resolved, with great propriety,\r\nthat they could not take up the subject; and that the proposition for\r\nembracing or rejecting the federal constitution, could come before no\r\ntribunal but that of the _State_ in convention or legislature.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the proceedings of the general convention at\r\nPhiladelphia transpired, the public mind was exceedingly agitated, and\r\nsuspended between hope and fear, until nine States had ratified the plan\r\nof a federal government. Indeed, the anxiety continued until Virginia\r\nand New York had acceded to the system. But this did not prevent the\r\ndemonstrations of joy, on the accession of each State.\r\n\r\nOn the ratification in Massachusetts, the citizens of Boston, in the\r\nelevation of their joy, formed a procession in honor of the happy event,\r\nwhich was novel, splendid and magnificent. This example was afterwards\r\nfollowed, and in some instances improved upon, in Baltimore, Charleston,\r\nPhiladelphia, New Haven, Portsmouth and New York, successivly. Nothing\r\ncould equal the beauty and grandeur of these exhibitions. A ship was\r\nmounted upon wheels, and drawn thro the streets; mechanics erected\r\nstages, and exhibited specimens of labor in their several occupations,\r\nas they moved along the road; flags with emblems, descriptiv of all the\r\narts and of the federal union, were invented and displayed in honor of\r\nthe government; multitudes of all ranks in life assembled to view the\r\nmajestic scenes; while sobriety, joy and harmony marked the brilliant\r\nexhibitions, by which the Americans celebrated the establishment of\r\ntheir empire.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1789, the delegates from the eleven ratifying States, convened\r\nin New York, where convenient and elegant accommodations had been\r\nfurnished by the citizens. On opening the ballots for President, it\r\nappeared that the late Commander in Chief of our armies was unanimously\r\nelected to the dignified office. This event diffused universal joy among\r\nthe friends to the union.\r\n\r\nThe deliberations of the first American Legislature were marked with\r\nwisdom, spirit, and generally with candor. The establishment of a\r\nrevenue and judiciary system, with other national measures; the wise\r\nappointments to offices; the promptness and energy of the executiv, with\r\na growing popular attachment to the general government, open the fairest\r\nprospect of peace, union and prosperity to these States; a prospect that\r\nis brightened by the accession of North Carolina to the government in\r\nNovember, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XVI.\r\n\r\nREMARKS _on the_ METHOD _of_ BURYING _the_ DEAD _among the_ NATIVS _of\r\nthis_ COUNTRY; _compared with that among the ancient_ BRITONS.\r\n\r\nBeing an Extract of a Letter to the Rev. Dr. STILES, President of Yale\r\nCollege, dated New York, January 20, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n[NOTE. _I had embraced the idea, that the remarkable fortifications on\r\nthe Muskingum, might be justly ascribed to the Spaniards, under\r\nFerdinand de Soto, who penetrated into Florida, about the year 1540;\r\nwhich opinion I endeavored to maintain as probably well founded, and\r\nwrote three or four letters on the subject, to Dr. Stiles, which were\r\npublished in 1789. It is now very clear that my opinion was_ not _well\r\nfounded; but that_ Chicaca, _which I had supposed to be Muskingum, ought\r\nto have been written_ Chicaça, _with a cedilla, as it is in the original\r\nSpanish; and pronounced_ Chikesaw. _This determins the place of Soto's\r\nwinter quarters, the second year after landing, to be in the territories\r\nof the present_ Chikesaws. _Those letters, therefore, are not worth\r\nrepublishing; but the following extract, on a different subject, may be\r\nconsidered as worthy of preservation._]\r\n\r\nBut how shall we account for the mounts, caves, graves, &c. and for the\r\ncontents, which evince the existence of the custom of burning the dead\r\nor their bones; can these be ascribed to the Spaniards? I presume, Sir,\r\nyou will be of opinion they cannot. Capt. Heart says,[50] these graves\r\nare small mounts of earth, from some of which human bones have been\r\ntaken; in one were found bones in the natural position of a man, buried\r\nnearly east and west, and a quantity of ising glass on his breast; in\r\nthe other graves, the bones were irregular, some calcined by fire,\r\nothers burnt only to a certain degree, so as to render them more\r\ndurable; in others the mouldered bones retain their shape, without any\r\nsubstance; others are partly rotten and partly the remains of decayed\r\nbones; in most of the graves were found stones evidently burnt, pieces\r\nof charcoal, Indian arrows and pieces of earthen ware, which appeared to\r\nbe a composition of shells and cement.\r\n\r\n    [50] Columbian Magazine for May, 1787.\r\n\r\nThat these mounts and graves are the works of the nativ Indians, is very\r\nevident, for such small mounts are scattered over every part of North\r\nAmerica. \"It was customary with the Indians of the West Jersey,\" says\r\nMr. Smith, page 137, \"when they buried the dead, to put family utensils,\r\nbows and arrows, and sometimes wampum into the grave, as tokens of their\r\naffection. When a person of note died far from the place of his own\r\nresidence, they would carry his bones to be buried there. They washed\r\nand perfumed the dead, painted the face, and followed singly; left the\r\ndead in a fitting posture, and covered the grave pyramidically. They\r\nwere very curious in preserving and repairing the graves of their dead,\r\nand pensivly visited them.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said by the English, who are best acquainted with the manners of\r\nthe nativs, that they had a custom of collecting, at certain stated\r\nperiods, all the bones of their deceased friends, and burying them in\r\nsome common grave. Over these cemetaries or general repositories of the\r\ndead, were erected those vast heaps of earth or mounts, similar to those\r\nwhich are called in England _barrows_, and which are discovered in every\r\npart of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Indians seem to have had two methods of burying the dead; one was,\r\nto deposit one body (or at most but a small number of bodies) in a\r\nplace, and cover it with stones, thrown together in a careless manner.\r\nThe pile thus formed would naturally be nearly circular, but those piles\r\nthat are discovered are something oval. In the neighborhood of my\r\nfather's house, about seven miles from Hartford, on the public road to\r\nFarmington, there is one of those _Carrnedds_ or heaps of stone. I\r\noften passed by it in the early part of my youth, but never measured its\r\ncircumference or examined its contents. My present opinion is, that its\r\ncircumference is about twenty five feet. The inhabitants in the\r\nneighborhood report, as a tradition received from the nativs, that an\r\nIndian was buried there, and that it is the custom for every Indian that\r\npasses by to cast a stone upon the heap. This custom I have never seen\r\npractised, but have no doubt of its existence; as it is confirmed by the\r\ngeneral testimony of the first American settlers.[51]\r\n\r\n    [51] The existence of a custom of paying respect to these\r\n    _Indian heaps_, as they are called, is proved by a ludicrous\r\n    practice, that prevails among the Anglo Americans in the\r\n    vicinity, of making strangers pull off their hats as they\r\n    pass by this grave. A man passing by with one who is a\r\n    stranger to the custom, never fails to practise a jest upon\r\n    him, by telling him that a spider, a caterpillar, or some\r\n    other insect is upon his hat; the unsuspecting traveller\r\n    immediately takes off his hat, to brush away the offending\r\n    insect, and finds by a roar of laughter, that a trick is put\r\n    upon him. I have often seen this trick played upon strangers,\r\n    and upon the neighbors who happen to be off their guard, to\r\n    the great amusement of the country people. The jest, however,\r\n    is a proof that the aborigines paid a respect to these rude\r\n    monuments, and in ridicule of that respect, probably,\r\n    originated the vulgar practice of the English, which exists\r\n    to this day.\r\n\r\nThe other mode of burying the dead, was to deposit a vast number of\r\nbodies, or the bones which were taken from the single scattered graves,\r\nin a common cemetary, and over them raise vast _tumuli_ or barrows, such\r\nas the mount at Muskingum, which is 390 feet in circumference, and 50\r\nfeet high. The best account of these cemetaries may be found in Mr.\r\nJefferson's Notes on Virginia, which will appear the most satisfactory\r\nto the reader in his own words.\r\n\r\n\"I know of no such thing existing as an Indian monument, for I would not\r\nhonor with that name, arrow points, stone hatchets, stone pipes, and\r\nhalf shapen images. Of labor on the large scale, I think there are no\r\nremains as respectable as would be a common ditch for the draining of\r\nlands, unless it be the barrows, of which many are to be found all over\r\nthis country. These are of different sizes, some of them constructed of\r\nearth, and some of loose stones. That they were repositories of the dead\r\nhas been obvious to all; but on what particular occasion constructed,\r\nwas matter of doubt. Some have thought they covered the bones of those\r\nwho have fallen in battles, fought on the spot of interment. Some\r\nascribe them to the custom, said to prevail among the Indians, of\r\ncollecting at certain periods the bones of all their dead, wherever\r\ndeposited at the time of death. Others again supposed them the general\r\nsepulchre for towns, conjectured to have been on or near these grounds,\r\nand this opinion was supported by the quality of the lands in which they\r\nare found, (those constructed of earth being generally in the softest\r\nand most fertile meadow grounds on river sides) and by a tradition said\r\nto be handed down from the aboriginal Indians, that when they settled in\r\na town, the first person who died was placed erect, and earth put about\r\nhim so as to cover and support him; that when another died, a narrow\r\npassage was dug to the first, the second reclined against him, and the\r\ncover of earth replaced, and so on. There being one of these in my\r\nneighborhood, I wished to satisfy myself whether any, and which of these\r\nopinions were just; for this purpose I determined to open and examin it\r\nthoroughly. It was situated on the low grounds of the Rivanna, about two\r\nmiles above its principal fork, and opposit to some hills on which had\r\nbeen an Indian town. It was of a spheroidical form, of about forty feet\r\ndiameter at the base, and had been of about twelve feet altitude, tho\r\nnow reduced by the plow to seven and a half; having been under\r\ncultivation about a dozen years.\r\n\r\n\"Before this, it was covered with trees of twelve inches diameter, and\r\nround the base was an excavation of five feet depth and width, from\r\nwhence the earth had been taken, of which the hillock was formed. I\r\nfirst dug superficially in several parts of it, and came to collections\r\nof human bones at different depths, from six inches to three feet, below\r\nthe surface. These were lying in the utmost confusion; some vertical,\r\nsome oblique, some horizontal, and directed to every point of the\r\ncompass, entangled and held together in clusters by the earth. Bones of\r\nthe most distant parts were found together; as for instance, the small\r\nbones of the foot in the hollow of a scull; many sculls were sometimes\r\nin contact, lying on the face, on the side, on the back, top or bottom,\r\nso as on the whole, to giv the idea of bones emptied promiscuously from\r\na bag or basket, and covered over with earth, without any attention to\r\ntheir order. The bones, of which the greatest numbers remained, were\r\nsculls, jaw bones, teeth, the bones of the arms, thighs, legs, feet and\r\nhands. A few ribs remained, some vertibræ of the neck and spine, without\r\ntheir processes, and one instance only of the bone which serves as the\r\nbase to the vertebral column (the os sacrum).\"\r\n\r\nAfter making some remarks on the state of putrefaction in which the\r\nbones appeared, and on the discovery of the bones of infants, Mr.\r\nJefferson goes on, \"I proceeded then to make a perpendicular cut thro\r\nthe body of the barrow, that I might examin its internal structure. This\r\npassed about three feet from its center, was opened to the former\r\nsurface of earth, and was wide enough for a man to walk thro and examin\r\nits sides.\r\n\r\n\"At the bottom, that is on the level of the circumjacent plain, I found\r\nbones; above these a few stones brought from a cliff, a quarter of a\r\nmile off, and from the river one eighth of a mile off. Then a large\r\ninterval of earth, then a stratum of bones, and so on. At one end of the\r\nsection, were four strata of bones plainly distinguishable; at the\r\nother, three; the strata in one part not ranging with those in another.\r\nThe bones nearest the surface were least decayed. No holes were\r\ndiscovered in any of them, as if made with bullets, arrows or other\r\nweapons. I conjectured that in this barrow might have been a thousand\r\nskeletons. Every one will readily seize the circumstances above related,\r\nwhich militate against the opinion, that it covered the bones only of\r\npersons fallen in battle; and against the tradition also which would\r\nmake it the common sepulchre of a town, in which the bodies were placed\r\nupright, and touching each other. Appearances certainly indicate, that\r\nit has derived both origin and growth from the accustomary collection of\r\nbones and deposition of them together; that the first collection had\r\nbeen deposited on the common surface of the earth, that a few stones\r\nwere put over it, and then a covering of earth, that the second had been\r\nlaid on this, had covered more or less of it in proportion to the number\r\nof bones, and was then also covered with earth, and so on. The following\r\nare the particular circumstances, which giv it this aspect. 1 The number\r\nof bones. 2 The strata in one part having no correspondence with those\r\nin another. 3 The different states of decay in these strata, which seem\r\nto indicate a difference in the time of inhumation. 4 The existence of\r\ninfant bones among them.\r\n\r\n\"But on whatever occasion they may have been made, they are of\r\nconsiderable notoriety among the Indians; for a party passing about\r\nthirty years ago, thro the part of the country where this barrow is,\r\nwent thro the woods directly to it, without any instructions or inquiry,\r\nand having staid about it some time, with expressions which were\r\nconstrued to be those of sorrow, they returned to the high road which\r\nthey had left about half a dozen miles, to pay this visit, and pursued\r\ntheir journey. There is another barrow, much resembling this, in the low\r\ngrounds of the south branch of the Shenandoah, where it is crossed by\r\nthe road leading from the Rockfish Gap to Staunton. Both of these have\r\nwithin these dozen years, been cleared of their trees and put under\r\ncultivation, are much reduced in their height, and spread in width, by\r\nthe plow, and will probably disappear in time. There is another on a\r\nhill in the blue ridge of mountains, a few miles north of Wood's Gap,\r\nwhich is made up of small stones thrown together. This has been opened,\r\nand found to contain human bones, as the others do. There are also\r\nothers in other parts of the country.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this account of Mr. Jefferson, to whose industry and talents the\r\nsciences and his country will ever be indebted, we may fairly conclude\r\nthat the mounts at Muskingum are the work of the nativ Indians. It is\r\nhowever necessary to notice two or three particulars, in the appearance\r\nof those at Muskingum, which are not discovered (or not mentioned by Mr.\r\nJefferson) in the structure of that which he examined. These are the\r\nising glass, the earthen ware, the charcoal, and the calcination of the\r\nbones by fire. As to the first it is well known that the ising glass is\r\nfound only in particular parts of America, and the savages in other\r\nparts could not obtain it. Mr. Jefferson mentions no discovery of\r\nearthen ware, but it was used by the Indians in every part of America.\r\nThe piece you once shewed me, sir, is a specimen of what is found\r\nwherever there has been an Indian town. Pieces of it are dug up\r\nfrequently in the meadows on Connecticut river. It appears to be formed\r\nof pure clay, or of shells and cement, hardened by fire, and as we might\r\nnaturally suppose, without glazing. By sections of vessels which remain,\r\nit is evident they were wrought with great ingenuity, and into beautiful\r\nand convenient forms.\r\n\r\nThe charcoal and calcination of some bones are a proof that there has\r\nexisted, among the savages of America, a custom of burning the dead, or\r\ntheir bones, after the dissolution of the flesh. It does not appear that\r\nthis custom was general, but it is not at all surprising to find that\r\nsuch a practice has existed in this country; since it has been frequent\r\namong the uncivilized nations on the eastern continent.\r\n\r\nI am sensible, sir, that you have entertained an opinion that the story\r\nof Madoc, the Welch Prince, may be true, and that it is possible the\r\nfortifications at Muskingum may be the work of his colony. Of the truth\r\nof this conclusion there is perhaps no direct evidence, and yet\r\ncollateral evidence may be obtained, that it is not chimerical. There is\r\nsuch a surprising affinity between the Indian mounts and the barrows or\r\ncemetaries which are remaining in England, but particularly in Wales and\r\nAnglesey, the last retreat of the original Britons, that we can hardly\r\nresolve it into a common principle of analogy that subsists between\r\nnations in the same stage of society; but incredulity itself will\r\nacknowlege the probability, that the primitiv inhabitants of Britain and\r\nAmerica had a common stock from which they were derived, long since the\r\nage of the first parent: Not that I believe North America to be peopled\r\nso late as the twelfth century, the period of Madoc's migration, but\r\nsupposing America to have been settled two or three thousand years\r\nbefore that period, a subsequent colony might pass the Atlantic and\r\nbring the Roman improvements in fortification.\r\n\r\nWaving further conjectures, I beg leave to describe the analogy between\r\nthe barrows in England and Wales, and in America. This will be striking,\r\nand cannot fail to entertain a curious reader, because it is attended\r\nwith positiv proofs.\r\n\r\nIn England, Scotland, Wales, and the island Anglesey, there are numbers\r\nof monuments erected by the ancients; but the most remarkable are\r\ngenerally found in the two latter, whither the old Britons retreated\r\nfrom their Roman and Saxon conquerors; and _Anglesey_, the ancient\r\n_Mona_, is supposed to have been the chief seat of the Druids. The\r\nremains of most consequence are the _cromlechs_, the _tumuli_, and the\r\n_cumuli_ or _carrnedds_. _Cromlech_, if the word is derived from the\r\nBritish roots _krom laech_, signifies a _bending stone_.[52] This is the\r\ncommon opinion, as Rowland observes.[53] If we trace the origin to the\r\nHebrew, the root of the old British,[54] we shall find it not less\r\nsignificativ; for _cærem luach_ signify _devoted stone_, or _altar_.\r\nThese _cromlechs_ consist of large stones, pitched on end in the earth,\r\nas supporters, upon which is laid a broad stone of a vast size. The\r\nsupporters stand in a bending posture, and are from three to seven feet\r\nhigh. The top stone is often found to be of twenty or thirty tons\r\nweight, and remains to this day on the pillars. Numbers of these are\r\nfound in Wales and Anglesey; but none is more remarkable than that in\r\nWiltshire, called _stone henge_, for a full description of which I must\r\nbeg leave to refer you to Camden's Britannia, vol. I, page 119. These\r\ncromlechs are doubtless works of great antiquity; but for what purpose\r\nthey were erected, at such an immense expense of time and labor as would\r\nbe necessary to convey stones of thirty tons weight a considerable\r\ndistance, and raise them several feet, is not easily determined. The\r\nprobability is that they were altars for sacrifice, as pieces of burnt\r\nbones and ashes are found near them. They might also be used in other\r\nceremonies, under the druidical system, as the ratification of\r\ncovenants, &c. As this kind of monuments is not found in America, I will\r\nwave a further consideration of it; observing only, that it was an\r\nancient practice among the eastern nations, to raise heaps of stones, as\r\nwitnesses of agreements, and sacrifice upon them, as a solemn\r\nratification of the act of the parties. Many instances of this ceremony\r\nare mentioned in the old testament. The covenant between Jacob and Laban\r\nwas witnessed by a heap of stones, which served also as a boundary\r\nbetween their respectiv claims. \"_And Jacob offered sacrifice upon the\r\nmount_, that is, the heap, _and called his brethren to eat bread_.\" Gen.\r\nxxxi, 54. A similar custom seems to have prevailed among the primitiv\r\nBritons.\r\n\r\n    [52] Camden's Britannia, volume II, page 759.\r\n\r\n    [53] Mona Antiq. Restaur, page 47.\r\n\r\n    [54] That the primitiv Britons may claim a very direct\r\n    descent from the ancient inhabitants of Syria and Phenicia,\r\n    whose languages were but branches from the same common stock,\r\n    with as Hebrew, may be made to appear probable by a\r\n    comparison of their customs; but may be almost demonstrated\r\n    by a collation of the old British language with the Hebrew\r\n    roots. _See my Dissertations on the English Language,\r\n    Appendix._\r\n\r\nBut the _tumuli_, barrows or mounts of earth, which remain in multitudes\r\nin England and Wales, are constructed exactly in the manner of the\r\nbarrows, described by Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Heart. One of these in\r\nWiltshire, Camden thus describes.[55] \"Here Selbury, a round hill,\r\nrises to a considerable height, and seems by the fashion of it, and the\r\nsliding down of the earth about it, to have been cast up by mens hands.\r\nOf this fort there are many in this country, round and copped, which are\r\ncalled _burrows_ or _barrows_; perhaps raised in memory of the soldiers\r\nslain there. For _bones are found in them_, and I have read, it was a\r\ncustom among the northern people, that every soldier who survived a\r\nbattle, should bring a helmet full of earth towards the raising of\r\nmonuments for their slain fellows.\"\r\n\r\n    [55] Britannia, volume I, page 127.\r\n\r\nThis is said to be the largest and most uniform barrow in the country,\r\nand perhaps in England; and I regret that the height and circumference\r\nare not mentioned. I am however informed verbally by a gentleman who has\r\nvisited England, that some of these tumuli appear to have been nearly\r\none hundred feet high.[56] There are also in the same country several\r\nkinds of barrows of different sizes; some surrounded with trenches;\r\nothers not; some with stones set round them, others without any; the\r\ngeneral figure of them is nearly circular, but a little oval.\r\n\r\n    [56] One as large as that is said to be found at Grave Creek,\r\n    about eighty miles above Muskingum.\r\n\r\nIn Penbrokeshire, in Wales, Camden informs us[57] \"there are divers\r\nancient tumuli, or artificial mounts for urn burial, whereof the most\r\nnotable I have seen, are those four, called _krigeu kemaes_, or the\r\nburrows of _kemeas_. One of these a gentlemen of the neighborhood, out\r\nof curiosity, and for the satisfaction of some friends, caused lately to\r\nbe dug; and discovered therein five urns, which contained a considerable\r\nquantity of burnt bones and ashes.\" If there is any difference between\r\nthese barrows, and those at Muskingum, it is this, that in Wales the\r\nbones were lodged in urns; probably this was the fate of the bodies of\r\neminent men only, or it proves a greater degree of improvement in\r\nBritain than appears among the American savages.\r\n\r\n    [57] Volume II, page 763.\r\n\r\nIn Caermardhinshire, there is a barrow of a singular kind. It is called,\r\n_krig y dyrn_ (probably the king's barrow[58].) The circumference at\r\nbottom is sixty paces, and its height about six yards. It rises by an\r\neasy ascent to the top, which is hollow. This is a heap of earth, raised\r\nover a _carrnedd_ or pile of stones. In the center of the cavity on the\r\ntop, there is a large flat stone, about nine feet by five; beneath this\r\nwas found a _kist vaen_, a kind of stone chest, four feet and a half by\r\nthree, and made up of stones, and within and about it were found a few\r\npieces of brick and stones. This might have been the tomb of a druid, or\r\nprince.\r\n\r\n    [58] Camden, volume II, page 751.\r\n\r\nThe _cumuli_ of stones or _caernedds_, as they are called by the Welsh,\r\nfrom _keren nedh_, a _coped heap_, are scattered over the west of\r\nEngland and Wales, and appear to have been raised in the manner of our\r\nIndian heaps, and for the same purpose, viz. to preserve the memory of\r\nthe dead. Every Indian in this country that passes one of these heaps,\r\nthrows a stone upon it. Rowland remarks that the same custom exists\r\namong the vulgar Welch to this day; and if I mistake not, Camden takes\r\nnotice of the same practice. Rowland says, \"in these _coel ceithic_,\r\n(certain festivals) people use, even to this day, to throw and offer\r\neach one his stone, tho they know not the reason. The common tradition\r\nis, that these heaps cover the graves of men, signal either for eminent\r\nvirtues, or notorious villanies, on which every person looked on himself\r\nobliged as he passed by, to bestow a stone, in veneration of his good\r\nlife, or in detestation of his vileness.\" This practice now prevails in\r\nWales and Anglesey, merely as a mark of contempt.\r\n\r\nThe _carrnedds_ in America answer exactly the description of those in\r\nWales, and the practice of throwing upon the heap each man his stone as\r\nhe passes by, exists among the Indians, in its purity; that is, as _a\r\nmark of respect_.\r\n\r\nIt is said by authors that mounts and piles of stones, are found\r\nlikewise in Denmark and Sweden; but in construction they differ from\r\nthose found in Britain. Yet from the foregoing descriptions, taken from\r\nauthentic testimony, it appears, that between the barrows in England\r\nand America, the manner of constructing them in both, and the purposes\r\nto which they were applied, there is an analogy, rarely to be traced in\r\nworks of such consequence, among nations whose intercourse ceased at\r\nBabel; an analogy that we could hardly suppose would exist among nations\r\ndescended from different stocks. This analogy however, without better\r\nevidence, will not demonstrate the direct descent of the Indians from\r\nthe ancient Celts or Britons. But as all the primitiv inhabitants of the\r\nwest of Europe were evidently of the same stock, it is natural to\r\nsuppose they might pass from Norway to Iceland, from Iceland to\r\nGreenland, and from thence to Labrador; and thus the North American\r\nsavages may claim a common origin with the primitiv Britons and Celts.\r\nThis supposition has some foundation, and is by no means obviated by\r\nCook's late discoveries in the Pacific ocean.[59]\r\n\r\n    [59] Mons. Mallet, in his Northern Antiquities, has produced\r\n    unquestionable testimony, from the Chronicles of Iceland and\r\n    others histories of the north, that the American continent\r\n    was discovered about the tenth century; and the esquimaux are\r\n    clearly of the same race as the Greenlanders.\r\n\r\nThese are however but conjectures. Future discoveries may throw more\r\nlight upon these subjects. At present, a few facts only can be collected\r\nto amuse a contemplativ mind, and perhaps lead to inquiries which will\r\nresult in a satisfactory account of the first peopling of America, and\r\nof the few remains of antiquity which it affords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XVII.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, FEBRUARY, 1788.\r\n\r\n_On the_ REGULARITY _of the_ CITY _of_ PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, how do you like Boston?\" said an American to a Londoner, who had\r\njust arrived, and walked thro the town. \"Extremely,\" replied the\r\nEnglishman; \"it resembles London in the crookedness and narrowness of\r\nthe streets; I am always pleased with a careless irregularity and\r\nvariety.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you like Boston,\" says a nativ of the town to a Philadelphian.\r\n\"I am much pleased with the people,\" replies the gentleman; \"but the\r\nstreets are so crooked, narrow and irregular, that I have good luck to\r\nfind my way, and keep my stockings clean.\"\r\n\r\nAn Englishman and a Bostonian, walking together in Philadelphia, were\r\nheard to say, \"how fatiguing it is to pass thro this town! such a\r\nsameness in the whole! no variety! when you have seen one street, you\r\nhave seen the whole town!\"\r\n\r\nThese remarks, which are heard every day, illustrate most strikingly the\r\nforce of habit and tradition. The influence of habit is every where\r\nknown and felt; any prepossessions therefore in favor of our nativ town,\r\nis not a matter of surprise. But that a traditionary remark or opinion\r\nshould be handed from one generation to another, and lead nations into\r\nerror, without a detection of its falsity, is a fact as astonishing as\r\nit is real. Such is the opinion of the writers on the fine arts; \"that\r\nvariety is pleasing;\" an opinion embraced without exception, and applied\r\npromiscuously to the works of nature and of art. I have rarely met with\r\na person, not an inhabitant of Philadelphia, who would not say he was\r\ndisgusted with its regularity; and I am confident that the opinion must\r\nproceed from that common place remark, _that variety is pleasing_;\r\notherwise men could not so unanimously condemn what constitutes its\r\n_greatest beauty_.\r\n\r\nThat in the productions of nature, variety constitutes a principal part\r\nof beauty, and a fruitful source of pleasure, will not be denied: But\r\nthe beauty and agreeableness of works of art depend on another\r\nprinciple, viz. _utility or convenience_. The _design_ of the work, or\r\nthe end proposed by it, must be attentivly considered before we are\r\nqualified to judge of its _beauty_.\r\n\r\nThis kind of beauty is called by Lord Kaim,[60] _relativ beauty_. He\r\nobserves very justly, that \"_intrinsic_ beauty is a perception of sense\r\nmerely; for to perceive the beauty of a spreading oak, or of a flowing\r\nriver, no more is required but singly an act of vision. _Relativ beauty_\r\nis accompanied with an act of understanding and reflection; for of a\r\nfine instrument or engine, we perceive not the _relativ_ beauty, until\r\nwe are made acquainted with its use and destination.\" A plow has not the\r\nleast _intrinsic_ beauty; but when we attend to its _use_, we are\r\nconstrained to consider it as a _beautiful instrument_, and such a view\r\nof it furnishes us with agreeable sensations.\r\n\r\n    [60] Elements of Criticism. Vol. I, page 198.\r\n\r\nThe single question therefore, with respect to a town or city, is this:\r\n_Is it planned and constructed for the greatest possible convenience_?\r\nIf so, it is completely beautiful. If wide and regular streets are more\r\nuseful and convenient than those that are narrow and crooked, then a\r\ncity constructed upon a regular plan is the most beautiful, however\r\nuniform the streets in their directions and appearance.\r\n\r\nI have often heard a comparison made between the level roads of Holland\r\nand the uniform streets of Philadelphia. A _dull sameness_ is said to\r\nrender both disagreeable. Yet if a person will attentivly consider the\r\ndifference, I am persuaded he will be convinced that his taste is but\r\n_half correct_; that is, that a just remark with respect to a level open\r\ncountry, is improperly applied to a commercial city. _Variety_ in the\r\nworks of nature is pleasing; but never in the productions of art,\r\nunless in copies of nature, or when that variety does not interfere with\r\n_utility_. A level champaign country is rarely convenient or useful; on\r\nthe other hand, it is generally more barren than a country diversified\r\nwith hills and vales. There is not generally any advantage to be derived\r\nfrom a wide extended plain; the principle of _utility_, therefore does\r\nnot oppose and supersede the taste for variety, and a tedious _sameness_\r\nis left to have its full effect upon the mind of a spectator. This is\r\nthe fact with respect to the roads in Holland.\r\n\r\nBut it is otherwise in a city, which is built for the express purpose of\r\naccommodating men in business. We do not consider it as we do a\r\nlandscape, an imitation of a natural scene, and designed to please the\r\neye; but we attend to its uses in artificial society, and if it appears\r\nto be calculated for the convenience of all classes of citizens, the\r\nplan and construction must certainly be beautiful, and afford us\r\nagreeable sensations.\r\n\r\nThe regularly built towns in America are Philadelphia, Charleston, in\r\nSouth Carolina, and New Haven. All these may be esteemed beautiful, tho\r\nnot perfectly so. Philadelphia wants a public square or place of resort\r\nfor men of business, with a spacious building for an exchange. This\r\nshould be near Market street, in the center of business. The gardens at\r\nthe State House are too small for a public walk in that large city. The\r\nwhole line of bank houses[61] is the effect of ill timed parsimony. The\r\nhouses are inconvenient, and therefore not pleasing to the eye; at the\r\nsame time they render Water street too narrow.\r\n\r\n    [61] A line of houses built on the descent of land to the\r\n    river, with a street adjacent to the houses on both sides.\r\n\r\nBut whatever faults may be found in the construction or plan of the\r\ncity, its general appearance is agreeable, and its _regularity_ is its\r\ngreatest beauty. Whenever I hear a person exclaim against the uniformity\r\nthat pervades that city, I suppose him the dupe of a common place\r\nremark, or that he believes a city built merely to please the eye of a\r\nspectator.\r\n\r\n_Charleston_ is situated upon low ground; but just above high water\r\nmark. The soil is sand, which, with a scarcity of stone, has prevented\r\nthe streets from being paved. The plan of the city is regular, but some\r\nof the streets are too narrow. As it is almost surrounded with water and\r\nlow marshy ground, it was necessary to attend to every circumstance that\r\nshould contribute to preserve a pure air. For this purpose, it was the\r\noriginal design of the citizens, to prevent any buildings from being\r\nerected on the wharves, in front of the town; thus leaving a principal\r\nstreet, called the bay, open to the sea breezes. Since the revolution,\r\nthis design has been partially dispensed with; and some buildings\r\nerected on the water side of the bay, and particularly one in front of\r\nthe Exchange, which stands at the head of Broad street, and commands an\r\nextensiv view of the town on one side, and of the harbor on the other.\r\nShould stores and warehouses be raised on the wharves, to such a height\r\nas to intercept a view of the harbor from the bay, they would diminish\r\nthe beauty of the town, and in some degree prevent the agreeable effect\r\nof the cool breezes from the sea.\r\n\r\n_New Haven_ was laid out on a most beautiful plan, which has however\r\nsuffered in the execution. The streets cross each other at right angles,\r\nas in Philadelphia; and divide the city into convenient squares. But in\r\nthe center is a large public square, the sides of which are more than\r\nthree hundred yards in length, and adorned with rows of trees. Thro the\r\ncenter of this square runs a line of elegant public buildings, viz. the\r\nstate house, two churches and a school house. This square is a capital\r\nornament to the town; but is liable to two exceptions. First, it is too\r\nlarge for the populousness of the city, which contains about 500\r\nbuildings. In so small a town, it must generally be empty, and\r\nconsequently givs the town an appearance of solitude or dullness. In the\r\nsecond place, that half of the square which lies west of the public\r\nbuildings, is occupied mostly by the church yard, which is enclosed with\r\na circular fence. This reduces the public ground on the opposit side to\r\na paralellogram, which is a less beautiful figure than a square; and\r\nannihilates the beauty of the western division which it occupies.\r\nNotwithstanding these circumstances, the green or public ground in the\r\ncenter of New Haven, renders it perhaps the most beautiful small\r\nsettlement in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XVIII.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, MAY, 1788.\r\n\r\n_A_ DISSERTATION _concerning the_ INFLUENCE _of_ LANGUAGE _on_ OPINIONS,\r\n_and of_ OPINIONS _on_ LANGUAGE.[62]\r\n\r\n    [62] This title, and many of the following ideas, are\r\n    borrowed from a treatise of Mr. Michaelis, director of the\r\n    Royal Society of Gottingen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe design of this dissertation is to show how far truth and accuracy of\r\nthinking are concerned in a clear understanding of _words_. I am\r\nsensible that in the eye of prejudice and ignorance, grammatical\r\nresearches are the business of school boys; and hence we may deduce the\r\nreason why philosophers have generally been so inattentiv to this\r\nsubject. But if it can be proved that the _mere use of words_ has led\r\nnations into error, and still continues the delusion, we cannot hesitate\r\na moment to conclude, that grammatical enquiries are worthy of the labor\r\nof _men_.\r\n\r\nThe Greek name of the Supreme Being, _Theos_, is derived from _Theo, to\r\nrun, or move one's self_. Hence we discover the ideas which the Greeks\r\noriginally entertained of God, viz. that he was the _great principle of\r\nmotion_. The same word, it is said, was primarily appropriated to the\r\nstars, as moving bodies; and it is probable that, in the early ages of\r\nGreece, the heavenly bodies might be esteemed Deities, and denominated\r\n_Theoi, moving bodies_ or _principles_. The Latin word _Deus_ was used\r\nto denote those inferior beings which we call _spirits_ or _angels_, or\r\nperhaps _one God_ among several. To giv the true idea of _Deus_ in\r\nFrench and English, the word should be rendered _le Dieu, the God_. This\r\nat least may be said of the word, in its true _original_ sense; however\r\nit may have been used in the later ages of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe English word _God_, is merely the old Saxon adjectiv _god_, now\r\nspelt and pronounced _good_.\r\n\r\nThe German _Gott_ is from the same root. The words _God_ and _good_\r\ntherefore are synonimous. The derivation of the word leads us to the\r\nnotions which our ancestors entertained of the Supreme Being; supposing\r\nhim to be the principle or author of good, they called him, by way of\r\neminence, _Good_, or _the Good_. By long use and the progress of\r\nknowlege, the word is become the name of the great Creator, and we have\r\nadded to it ideas of other attributes, as justice, power, immutability,\r\n&c. Had our heathen ancestors entertained different ideas of the Deity;\r\nhad they, for instance, supposed justice to have been his leading\r\nattribute, if I may use the term, they would have called him _the just_;\r\nand this appellation, by being uniformly appropriated to a certain\r\ninvisible being, or supposed cause of certain events, would in time have\r\nlost the article _the_, and _just_ would have become the _name_ of the\r\nDeity. Such is the influence of opinion in the formation of language.\r\n\r\nLet us now compare the names of the Deity in the three languages; the\r\nGreek, _Theos_, denoting a _moving being_, or the _principle of action_,\r\nevinces to us that the Greeks gave the name to the _cause of events_,\r\nwithout having very clear ideas of the nature or attributes of that\r\ncause. They supposed the great operations of nature to have each its\r\ncause; and hence the plurality of causes, _theoi_, or moving principles.\r\n\r\nThe Romans borrowed the same word, _Deus_, and used it to denote the\r\ncelestial _agents_ or _gods_ which they supposed to exist, and to\r\nsuperintend the affairs of the universe.\r\n\r\nOur northern ancestors had an idea that all favorable events must have\r\nan efficient cause; and to this cause they gave the name of _God_ or\r\n_good_. Hence we observe that the English and German words _God_ and\r\n_Got_ do not convey precisely the same idea, as the _Theos_ and _Deus_\r\nof the Greeks and Romans. The former cannot be used in the plural\r\nnumber; as they are the names of a single indivisible being; the latter\r\nwere used as names common to a number of beings.\r\n\r\nThe word _Demon_, in Greek, was used to signify subordinate deities,\r\nboth good and evil. The Jews, who had more perfect ideas of the Supreme\r\nBeing, supposed there could be but one good Deity, and consequently that\r\nall the _demons_ of the Greeks must be _evil_ beings or _devils_. In\r\nthis sense alone they used the word, and this restricted sense has been\r\ncommunicated thro Christian countries in modern ages. The opinion of the\r\nJews, therefore, has had a material effect upon language, and would lead\r\nus into an error respecting the Greek mythology; unless we should trace\r\nthe word _demon_ to its primitiv signification.\r\n\r\nThe word _devil_, in English, is merely a corruption of _the evil_,\r\noccasioned by a rapid pronunciation. This will not appear improbable to\r\nthose who know, that in some of the Saxon dialects, the character which\r\nwe write _th_ is almost invariably written and pronounced _d_. Hence we\r\nlearn, the notion which our ancestors entertained of the _cause of\r\nevil_, or of unfortunate events. They probably ascribed such events to a\r\nmalignant principle, or being, which they called, by way of eminence,\r\n_the evil_; and these words, corrupted by common use, have given name to\r\nthe being or principle.\r\n\r\nI would only observe here that the etymology of these two words, _God_\r\nand _devil_, proves that the Manichean doctrine of a _good_ and _evil_\r\nprinciple prevailed among our northern ancestors. It has prevailed over\r\nmost of the eastern countries in all ages, and Christianity admits the\r\ndoctrine, with this improvement only, that it supposes the _evil_\r\nprinciple to be subordinate to the _good_. The supreme cause of events,\r\nChristians believe to be _good_ or _God_, for the words are radically\r\nthe same; the _cause of evil_ they believe to be subordinate; yet,\r\nstrange as it may seem, they suppose the _subordinate evil_ principle to\r\nbe the most prevalent.\r\n\r\nWe are informed by Ludolph, that the Ethiopeans, having but one word for\r\n_nature_ and _person_, could not understand the controversy about\r\nChrist's two natures. This is not surprising; nations, in a savage\r\nstate, or which have not been accustomed to metaphysical disquisitions,\r\nhave no terms to communicate abstract ideas, which they never\r\nentertained; and hence the absurdity of attempting to christianize\r\nsavages. Before men can be Christians they must be civilized; nay, they\r\nmust be philosophers. It is probable that many who are called\r\nChristians, are in the state of the Ethiopians, with respect to the same\r\ndoctrin; and that they pass thro life, without ever having any clear\r\nideas of the different natures of Christ. Yet the distinction is\r\nconstantly made in words; and that distinction passes for a difference\r\nof ideas. Such is the influence of language on opinion.\r\n\r\nThe words _soul_, _mind_ and _spirit_, are constantly used by people,\r\nand probably the difference of words has given rise to an opinion that\r\nthere is an actual difference of things. Yet I very much question\r\nwhether the persons who use these words every day, annex any distinct\r\nideas to them; or if they do, whether they could explain the difference.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks believed in the doctrin of transmigration. They had observed\r\nthe metamorphosis of the caterpillar, and supposing the same soul to\r\nanimate the different bodies, and believing the soul to be perpetual or\r\nimmortal, they made the butterfly the hieroglyphic of the soul: Hence\r\nthe Greek word for soul, _psuke_, came to signify also a _butterfly_.\r\n\r\nFor want of attending to the true etymology of the word _glory_, false\r\nopinions have gained an establishment in the world, and it may be\r\nhazardous to dispute them. It is said that the _glory_ of God does not\r\ndepend on his creatures, and that the glory of the good man depends not\r\non the opinion of others. But what is glory? The Greek word _doxe_\r\nexplains it. It is derived from _dokeo, to think_; and signifies the\r\n_good opinion of others_. This is its _true_ original meaning; a man's\r\nglory therefore consists in having the good opinion of men, and this\r\ncannot generally be obtained, but by meritorious actions. The _glory_ of\r\nGod consists in the exalted ideas which his creatures entertain of his\r\nbeing and perfections. His _glory_ therefore depends _wholly on his\r\ncreatures_. The word is indeed often used to signify the greatness,\r\nsplendor or excellence of the divine character. In this sense the\r\n_divine glory_ may be independent of created beings; but it is not the\r\nprimitiv sense of the word, nor the sense which answers to the original\r\nmeaning of the Greek _doxe_, and the Latin _gloria_.\r\n\r\nNo right in England and America is so much celebrated as that of _trial\r\nby peers_; by which is commonly understood, _trial by equals_. The right\r\nis valuable, but is not derived from the primitiv custom of _trial by\r\nequals_; on the contrary, it is very questionable whether such a custom\r\nexisted prior to Alfred. Yet the _trial by peers_ existed long before,\r\nand can be traced back to the date of the Christian era. The truth is,\r\nthe word _peer_ is not derived from the Latin _par_, equal; but from the\r\nGerman, or Teutonic _bar_ or _par_, which signified a landholder,\r\nfreeman or judge. The _bars_ were that class of men who held the _fees_\r\nor property in estates; and from whom the word _baron_ and the attendant\r\nprivileges are derived. We have the same root in _baron_, _baronet_,\r\n_parliament_, _parish_, and many other words, all implying some degree\r\nof authority, eminence or jurisdiction. From the same word _bar_ or\r\n_par_, (for _B_ and _P_ are convertible letters) the word _peer_ is\r\nderived, as it is used in the common expressions _house of peers_,\r\n_trial by peers_. It signified originally, not _equals_, but _judges_ or\r\nbarons. The _house of peers_ in England derives its appellation and its\r\njurisdiction from the ancient mode of trial by _bars_ or barons; for it\r\nis the final resort in all judicial cases. Yet the ancient English\r\nlawyers, supposing the word to be from the Latin _par_, equal, have\r\nexplained it in that sense, and multiplied encomiums without end upon\r\nthe excellence of the privilege. The privilege is valuable, but its\r\nexcellence, if it consists in a _trial by equals_, is modern, compared\r\nwith the original custom, which was a _trial by barons_, or principal\r\nlandholders.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that our modern writers, misunderstanding the term\r\n_voluptas_, have passed too severe censures upon epicures. The true\r\nprimitiv meaning of _voluptas_ was that of _pleasurable sensations_\r\narising from innocent gratifications. Our modern word _voluptuousness_\r\ncarries with it a much stronger idea, and hence we are led into an error\r\nreflecting the doctrine of Epicurus, who might confine his ideas of\r\npleasure to innocent gratifications.\r\n\r\nWe have been accustomed from childhood to hear the expressions, _the dew\r\nfalls_; _the dews of heaven_; and it is probable that nine people out of\r\nten, have never suspected the inaccuracy of the phrases. But _dew_ is\r\nmerely the perspiration of the earth; it _rises_ instead of _falling_,\r\nand rises during the night.[63]\r\n\r\n    [63] Any person may prove this by a trifling experiment. Let\r\n    him place a glass receiver or bowl over the grass in a\r\n    summer's day, and the next morning he will find as much dew\r\n    _under_ it as around it.\r\n\r\n    The truth is this; the particles of water are constantly\r\n    exhaled from the earth by the heat of the sun. During the day\r\n    time, these particles ascend in an imperceptible manner, and\r\n    furnish the atmosphere with the materials of clouds and rain.\r\n    But in the night, the atmosphere grows cool, while the earth,\r\n    retaining a superior degree of heat, continues to throw off\r\n    the particles of water. These particles, meeting the colder\r\n    atmosphere, are condensed, and lodge upon the surface of the\r\n    earth, grass, trees and other objects. So that the\r\n    expression, _the dew falls_, is in a degree true, altho it\r\n    _first rises_ from the earth.\r\n\r\nIt was also supposed that _manna_ in the eastern countries, came from\r\nabove, and it is called in scripture _bread from heaven_. Yet _manna_ is\r\na gum, exuding from plants, trees and bushes, when pierced by certain\r\ninsects. The truth of this fact was not discovered, till the middle of\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nEvery man knows, when the prices of goods rise, it is said they become\r\n_dear_; yet when the prices rise in consequence of an overflowing sum of\r\nmoney in circulation, the fact is that the _value of money falls_, and\r\nthe value of goods remains the same. This erroneous opinion had an\r\namazing effect in raising popular clamor, at the commencement of the\r\nlate revolution.\r\n\r\nI will name but one other instance, which has a material influence upon\r\nour moral and religious opinions. It is said in scripture that _God\r\nhardened Pharaoh's heart_. How? Was there a miracle in the case? By no\r\nmeans. The manner of speaking leads us into the mistake. The first cause\r\nis mentioned, and not the intermediate cause or causes. So we should\r\nsay, that _General Washington attacked the British troops at Monmouth_;\r\naltho he was at a great distance when the attack was commenced, and only\r\n_ordered_ the attack. I suspect that similar modes of speaking in\r\nscripture often lead superficial minds into mistakes, and in some\r\ninstances, giv occasion to infidels to scoff at passages, which, if\r\nrightly understood, would silence all objections.\r\n\r\nThis is a fruitful theme, and would lead an ingenious inquirer into a\r\nwide field of investigation. But I have neither time nor talents to do\r\nit justice; the few hints here suggested may have some effect in\r\nconvincing my readers of the importance and utility of all candid\r\nresearches into the origin and structure of speech; and pave the way for\r\nfurther investigations, which may assist us in correcting our ideas and\r\nascertaining the force and beauty of our own language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XIX.\r\n\r\n                         PHILADELPHIA, 1787.\r\n\r\n_On_ VOCAL MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe establishment of schools for teaching psalmody in this city is a\r\npleasing institution; but people seem not to understand the design, or\r\nrather are not aware of the advantages which may result from it, if\r\nproperly conducted and encouraged. Most people consider music merely as\r\na source of pleasure; not attending to its influence on the human mind,\r\nand its consequent effects on society. But it should be regarded as an\r\narticle of education, _useful_ as well as ornamental.\r\n\r\nThe human mind is formed for activity; and will ever be employed in\r\nbusiness or diversions. Children are perpetually in motion, and all the\r\ningenuity of their parents and guardians should be exerted to devise\r\nmethods for restraining this activ principle, and directing it to some\r\n_useful_ object, or to _harmless trifles_. If this is not done, their\r\npropensity to action, even without a vicious motiv, will hurry them into\r\nfollies and crimes. Every thing innocent, that attracts the attention of\r\nchildren, and will employ their minds in leisure hours, when idleness\r\nmight otherwise open the way to vice, must be considered as a valuable\r\nemployment. Of this kind is vocal music. There were instances of youth,\r\nthe last winter, who voluntarily attended a singing school in preference\r\nto the theatre. It is but reasonable to suppose, that if they would\r\nneglect a theatre for singing, they would neglect a thousand amusements,\r\nless engaging, and more pernicious.\r\n\r\nInstrumental music is generally prefered to vocal, and considered as an\r\nelegant accomplishment. It is indeed a pleasing accomplishment; but the\r\npreference given to it, is a species of the same false taste, which\r\nplaces a son under the tuition of a _drunken clown_, to make him a\r\ngentleman of _strict morals_.\r\n\r\nInstrumental music may exceed vocal in some nice touches and\r\ndistinctions of sound; but when regarded as to its effects upon the mind\r\nand upon society, it is as inferior to vocal, as sound is inferior to\r\nsense. It is very easy for a spruce beau to display a contempt for vocal\r\nmusic, and to say that human invention has gone beyond the works of God\r\nAlmighty. But till the system of creation shall be new modelled, the\r\nhuman voice properly cultivated will be capable of making the most\r\nperfect music. It is neglected; sol faing is unfashionable, and that is\r\nenough to damn it: But people who have not been acquainted with the\r\nperfection of psalmody, are incapable of making a suitable comparison\r\nbetween vocal and instrumental music. I have often heard the best vocal\r\nconcerts in America, and the best instrumental concerts; and can\r\ndeclare, that the music of the latter is as inferior to that of the\r\nformer, as the merit of a _band box macaroni_ is to that of a Cato.\r\n\r\nInstrumental music affords an agreeable amusement; and as an amusement\r\nit ought to be cultivated. But the advantage is private and limited; it\r\npleases the ear, but leaves no impression upon the heart.\r\n\r\nThe design of music is to awaken the passions, to soften the heart for\r\nthe reception of sentiment. To awaken passion is within the power of\r\ninstruments, and this may afford a temporary pleasure; but society\r\nderives no advantage from it, unless some useful sentiment is left upon\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\nInstruments are secondary in their use; they were invented originally,\r\nnot to supercede, but to assist the voice. The first histories of all\r\nnations were written in verse, and sung by their bards. In later ages,\r\nthe _oaten reed_, the _harp_ and the _lyre_, were found to improve the\r\npleasures of music; but the neglect of the voice and of sentiment was\r\nreserved for modern corruption. Ignorant indeed is the man, and\r\npossessed of a wretched taste, who can seriously despise the humble\r\npleasures of vocal music, and prefer the bare harmony of sounds.\r\nSentiment should ever accompany music; the sounds should ever correspond\r\nwith the ideas, otherwise music loses all its force. Union of\r\nsentiment, with harmony of sounds, is the perfection of music. Every\r\nstring of the human heart may be touched; every passion roused by the\r\ndifferent kinds of sounds; the courage of the warrior; the cruelty of\r\nthe tyrant; anger; grief; love, with all its sensibilities, are subject\r\nto the influence of music. Even brutes acknowlege its effects; but while\r\nthey in common with man feel the effects of a harmony of mere sounds,\r\nman enjoys the superior felicity of receiving sentiment; and while he\r\nrelishes the pleasures of chords in sound, he imbibes a disposition to\r\ncommunicate happiness to society.\r\n\r\nSeldom indeed do men reflect on the connexion between the chords of\r\nmusic and the social affections. Morality is to immorality, what harmony\r\nis to discord. Society detests vice, and the ear is offended with\r\ndiscordant sounds. Society is pleased and happified with virtue, and the\r\near is delighted with harmony. This beautiful analogy points out the\r\nutility of cultivating music as a science. Harsh discordant sounds\r\nexcite the peevish malevolent passions; harmonious sounds correct and\r\nsoften the rougher passions.\r\n\r\nEvery person will acknowlege, that love refines the heart, and renders\r\nit more susceptible, and more capable of social virtue. It is for this\r\nreason that men who have particular attachments to women, or associate\r\nmuch with ladies of delicacy, are more disposed to do acts of kindness,\r\nin every sphere of life, than those who seldom frequent ladies company.\r\nOn the other hand, anger, jealousy, envy, are dissocial passions; and\r\neven when they are excited by a single object, they poison the heart,\r\nand disqualify it for exciting the social affections towards any of the\r\nhuman race. Every institution, therefore, calculated to prepare the\r\nhuman heart for exerting the social virtues, and to suppress or check\r\nthe malignant passions, must be highly beneficial to society; and such I\r\nconsider establishments in favor of vocal music. Happy, indeed, should I\r\nfeel, could I see youth devoted every where to the refinement of their\r\nvoices and morals; to see them prefer moral or religious pieces to the\r\nindecent songs or low diversions which taint the mind in early life, and\r\ndiffuse their pernicious influence through society.\r\n\r\nIf the poison of the tarantula may be counteracted by music; if the\r\nSpanish ladies are won by nocturnal serenades; if the soldier is\r\ninspired with courage by the martial sounds of the trumpet, and the\r\nChristian impressed with devout sentiments by the solemn tones of the\r\norgan; what advantage may society derive from the softening harmony of\r\nchoirs of voices, celebrating the praises of social virtue! Happy days!\r\nwhen _false taste_ and _false opinions_ shall vanish before the progress\r\nof _truth_; when princes shall resume their ancient and honorable task\r\nof teaching the young to be _good_ and _great_; when an Addison shall be\r\npreferred to a Chesterfield; when the wealth of nations shall be no\r\nlonger lavished upon fiddlers and dancers; when the characters of a\r\n_Benezet_ and a WASHINGTON shall obscure the glories of a Cæsar; and\r\nwhen no man shall be ashamed to be _good_, because it is unfashionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XX.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, JUNE, 1788.\r\n\r\n_On_ MORALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The principles of morality are little understood among savages,\" says\r\nLord Kaimes, \"and if they arrive to maturity among enlightened nations,\r\nit is by slow degrees.\"\r\n\r\nWith submission to that writer, I would advance another position equally\r\ntrue, \"that the principles of eating and drinking are little understood\r\nby savages, and if they arrive to maturity among civilized nations, it\r\nis by slow degrees.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is, morality consists in discharging the social duties of\r\nlife; and so far as the state of savages requires an intercourse of\r\nduties, the moral principles seem to be as perfect in them as in more\r\nenlightened nations. Savages in a perfectly rude state have little or no\r\ncommerce; the transactions between man and man are confined to very few\r\nobjects, and consequently the laws which regulate their intercourse and\r\ndistribute justice, must be few and simple.[64] But the crime of murder\r\nis as severely punished by savages, as by civilized nations. Nay, I\r\nquestion whether it is possible to name the barbarous tribe, which\r\nsuffers an individual to take the life of another, upon as easy terms as\r\nthe modern feudal Barons in Europe may do that of a vassal; or with the\r\nsame impunity that a planter in the West Indies takes the life of a\r\nslave. I speak of a time of peace, and of the conduct of savages towards\r\ntheir own tribes. As to war, every nation of savages has its arbitrary\r\ncustoms, and so has every civilized nation. Savages are generally\r\npartial and capricious in the treatment of their prisoners; some they\r\ntreat with a singular humanity; and others they put to death with the\r\nseverest cruelty. Well, do not civilized people the same? Did a savage\r\never endure greater torments, than thousands of prisoners during the\r\nlate war? But not to mention the practice of a single nation, at a\r\nsingle period; let us advert to a general rule among civilized nations;\r\nthat it is lawful to put to death prisoners taken in a garrison by\r\nstorm. The practice grounded on this rule, is as direct and as enormous\r\na violation of the laws of morality, as the slow deliberate tortures\r\nexercised by the most barbarous savages on earth.\r\n\r\n    [64] It is a fact, supported by unquestionable testimony,\r\n    that the savage nations on the frontiers of these States,\r\n    have fewer vices in proportion to their virtues, than are to\r\n    be found in the best regulated civilized societies with which\r\n    we are acquainted.\r\n\r\nWell, what are the ideas of savages respecting _theft_? How do they\r\ndiffer from those of an enlightened people? Many things are possessed in\r\ncommon, as provisions taken in hunting, corn, &c. Ferdinand de Soto\r\nrelates, that the tribes (and he visited hundreds in Florida) had public\r\ngranaries of corn laid up for winter, which was distributed by authority\r\nto each family, according to its number. But for an individual to take\r\nfrom this common stock without license, was considered as a criminal\r\ndefrauding of the public. And with regard to the few articles, in which\r\nindividuals acquire private property, the savages have as correct ideas\r\nof _meum_ and _tuum_, of theft, trespass, &c. and are as careful to\r\nguard private property from invasion, by laws and penalties, as any\r\ncivilized people. The laws of the Creeks, the Cherokees, the Six\r\nNations, &c. with regard to these and many other crimes, in point of\r\nreason and equity, stand on a footing with those of the most civilized\r\nnations; and in point of execution and observance, their administration\r\nwould do honor to any government. Among most savage nations there is a\r\nkind of monarchy which is efficient in administration; and among those\r\ntribes which have had no intercourse with civilized nations, and which\r\nhave not been deceived by the tricks of traders; the common arts of\r\ncheating, by which millions of enlightened people get a living or a\r\nfortune, are wholly unknown. This is an incontrovertible fact. I lately\r\nbecame acquainted with a lad of about twelve years old, who was taken\r\ncaptiv by the Indians in 1778, while a child, and had continued with\r\nthem till about ten years old. He had no recollection of the time when\r\nhe was taken, and consequently his mind could not have been corrupted\r\namong the English. When he was restored, agreeable to the treaty, he was\r\na perfect savage; but what I relate the circumstance for, is this; the\r\nlad was not addicted to a single vice. He was instant and cheerful in\r\nobeying commands; having not even a disposition to refuse or evade a\r\ncompliance. He had no inclination to lie or steal; on the other hand, he\r\nwas always surprised to find a person saying one thing and meaning\r\nanother. In short, he knew not any thing but honesty and undisguised\r\nfrankness and integrity. A single instance does not indeed establish a\r\ngeneral rule; but those who are acquainted with the nativs of America\r\ncan testify that this is the general character of savages who are not\r\ncorrupted by the vices of civilized nations.\r\n\r\nBut it is said savages are revengeful; their hatred is hereditary and\r\nperpetual. How does this differ from the hatred of civilized nations? I\r\nquestion much whether the principle of revenge is not as perfect in\r\nenlightened nations, as in savages. The difference is this; a savage\r\nhunts the man who has offended him, like a wild beast, and assassinates\r\nhim wherever he finds him; the _gentleman_ pursues his enemy or his\r\nrival with as much rancor as a savage, and even stoops to notice little\r\naffronts, that a savage would overlook; but he does not stab him\r\nprivately; he hazards his own life with that of his enemy, and one or\r\nboth are very _honorably_ murdered. The principle of revenge is equally\r\nactiv in both cases; but its operation is regulated by certain arbitrary\r\ncustoms. A savage is open and avows his revenge, and kills privately;\r\nthe polite and well bred take revenge in a more _honorable_ way, when\r\n_life_ is to be the price of satisfaction; but in cases of small\r\naffronts, they are content with privately stabbing the reputation or\r\nruining the fortunes of their enemies. In short, the passions of a\r\nsavage are under no restraint; the passions of enlightened people are\r\nrestrained and regulated by a thousand civil laws and accidental\r\ncircumstances of society.\r\n\r\nBut it will be objected, if savages understood principles of morality,\r\nthey would lay such passions under restraint. Not at all: Civil and\r\npolitical regulations are not made, because the things prohibited are in\r\ntheir own nature wrong; but because they produce inconveniencies to\r\nsociety. The most enlightened nations do not found their laws and\r\npenalties on an abstract regard to _wrong_; nor has government any\r\nconcern with that which has no influence on the peace and safety of\r\nsociety. If savages, therefore, leave every man to take his own revenge,\r\nit is a proof that they judge it the best mode of preventing the\r\nnecessity of it; that is, they think their society and government safer\r\nunder such a license, than under regulations which should control the\r\npassions of individuals. They may have their ideas of the nature of\r\nrevenge independent of society; but it will be extremely difficult to\r\nprove, that, abstracted from a regard to a Deity and to society, there\r\nis such a thing as _right_ and _wrong_. I consider _morality_ merely as\r\nit respects _society_; for if we superadd the obligations of a divine\r\ncommand, we blend it with _religion_; an article in which Christians\r\nhave an infinit advantage over savages.\r\n\r\nConsidering moral duties as founded solely on the constitution of\r\nsociety, and as having for their sole end the happiness of social\r\nbeings, many of them will vary in their nature and extent, according to\r\nthe particular state and circumstances of any society.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Britons, a singular custom prevailed; which was, a\r\ncommunity of wives by common consent. Every man married one woman; but a\r\nnumber, perhaps ten or twelve, relations or neighbors, agreed to possess\r\ntheir wives in common. Every woman's children were accounted the\r\nchildren of her husband; but every man had a share in the common\r\ndefence and care of this little community.[65] Was this any breach of\r\nmorality? Not in the least. A British woman, in the time of Severus,\r\nhaving become intimate with Julia Augusta, and other ladies, at the\r\ncourt of Rome, had observed what passed behind the curtain; and being\r\none day reproached for this custom of the Britons, as infamous in the\r\nwomen, and barbarous in the men; she replied, \"We do that _openly_ with\r\nthe _best_ of our men, which you do _privately_ with the _worst_ of\r\nyours.\" This custom, so far from being infamous or barbarous, originated\r\nin public and private convenience. It prevented jealousy and the\r\ninjuries of adultery, in a state where private wrongs could not easily\r\nbe prevented or redressed. It might be an excellent substitute for penal\r\nlaws and a regular administration of justice. But there is a better\r\nreason for the custom, which writers seem to have overlooked; and this\r\nis, that a community multiplied the chances of subsistence and security.\r\nIn a savage life, subsistence is precarious, for it depends on\r\ncontingent supplies by hunting and fishing. If every individual,\r\ntherefore, should depend solely on his own good luck, and fail of\r\nsuccess, his family must starve. But in a community of twelve, the\r\nprobability that some one would procure provisions is increased as\r\ntwelve to one. Hence the community of provisions among most savage\r\nnations.[66]\r\n\r\n    [65] Uxores habent deni, duodenique inter se communes; et\r\n    maxime fratres cum fratribus, et parentes cum liberis. Sed si\r\n    qui sunt ex his nati; eorum habenter liberi a quibus primum\r\n    virgines quæque ductæ sunt.---- _Cæsar de bell. Gall. Lib.\r\n    5._\r\n\r\n    [66] Let an individual depend solely on his own exertions for\r\n    food, and a single failure of crops subjects him to a famin.\r\n    Let a populous country depend solely on its own produce, and\r\n    the probability of a famine is diminished; yet is still\r\n    possible. But a commercial intercourse between all nations,\r\n    multiplies the chances of subsistence, and reduces the matter\r\n    to a certainty. China, a well peopled country, is subject to\r\n    a famin merely for want of a free commerce.\r\n\r\nThe Britons, when the Romans first visited their island, did not attend\r\nmuch to the cultivation of the earth. \"Interiores plerique,\" says Cæsar,\r\n\"frumenta non serunt, sed lacte et carne vivunt.\" By establishing a\r\ncommunity of goods, they secured themselves against the hazard of want;\r\nand by a community of wives and offspring, they confirmed the\r\nobligations of each to superintend the whole; or rather, changed into a\r\nnatural obligation what might otherwise depend on the feebler force of\r\npositiv compact. Besides, it is very possible that personal safety from\r\nthe invasion of tribes or individuals, might be another motiv for\r\nestablishing these singular communities. At any rate, we must suppose\r\nthat the Britons had good civil or political reasons for this custom;\r\nfor even savages do not act without reason. And if they found society\r\nmore safe and happy, with such a custom than without it, it was most\r\nundoubtedly right.\r\n\r\nShould it be said, that a community is prohibited by divine command; I\r\nwould answer that it is not presumable that the old Britons had any\r\npositiv revelation; and I do not know that the law of nature will decide\r\nagainst their practice. The commands given to the Jews were positiv\r\ninjunctions; but they by no means extend to all nations, farther than as\r\nthey are founded on _immutable principles_ of right and wrong in all\r\nsocieties. Many of the Mosaic precepts are of this kind; they are\r\nunlimited in their extent, because they stand on principles which are\r\nunlimited in their operation.\r\n\r\nAdultery is forbidden in the Jewish laws; and so it is in the codes of\r\nother nations. But adultery may be defined differently by different\r\nnations; and the criminality of it depends on the particular positiv\r\ninstitutions, or accidental circumstances of a nation. The same reasons\r\nthat would render a similar custom in civilized modern nations highly\r\ncriminal, might render it innocent and even necessary among the old\r\nBritons. A prohibition to gather sticks on the Sabbath, under a penalty\r\nof death for disobedience, might be founded on good reasons among the\r\nancient Jews; but it would be hard to prove that a modern law of the\r\nsame kind, would be warrantable in any nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXI.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, JUNE, 1788.\r\n\r\n_A_ LETTER _from a_ LADY, _with_ REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n          SIR,\r\n\r\nAs you have, in your writings, discovered that you take a particular\r\ninterest in the happiness of ladies, I hope you will not deem it a\r\ndeviation from delicacy, if one of them offers you her grateful\r\nacknowlegements, and requests you to giv your sentiments upon what will\r\nbe here related.\r\n\r\nAbout four years ago, I was visited by a gentleman who professed an\r\nunalterable attachment for me. He being a genteel, sensible and handsome\r\nman, I thought myself justifiable in treating him with complacency.\r\nAfter I was convinced by his constant attention and frequent\r\nprofessions, that I was a favorite, he used frequently to upbraid me,\r\nfor being so silent and reserved: It shewed, he said, a want of\r\nconfidence in him; for I must be sensible he derived the greatest\r\npleasure imaginable in my conversation, and why would I then deprive him\r\nof the greatest happiness by absenting myself, when he paid a visit,\r\nrefusing to chat with my usual freedom. Tho he professed himself to be\r\nan admirer of candor, and a strict adherer to the rules of honor, still\r\nI could not but doubt his sincerity from the extravagance of his\r\nexpressions. This he considered as an affront, saying that no man of\r\n_honor_ would express sentiments that were not genuine. I found myself\r\nunwilling to say any thing that should be disagreeable, and disposed to\r\nmake him understand by an attention that I supposed him entitled to,\r\nthat he was prefered to any other person. He continued his visits in\r\nthis manner for about eighteen months, conducting himself with the\r\ngreatest delicacy, affection and respect. During this time, he never\r\nexpressed a wish to be united, which made me uneasy, as I knew that all\r\nmy friends thought us engaged. At last I told him his attention was too\r\nparticular; I knew not what construction to put upon it. He replied that\r\nI was too particular in my ideas; it was a convincing proof to him, with\r\nmy resenting _trifling liberties_, that I had not an affection for him,\r\nand that he was not the man I wished to be connected with; therefore he\r\nwould not trouble me any longer with his company, and wished me a good\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, you must suppose, distressed me greatly; I viewed myself\r\ninjured and trifled with, but knew not how to obtain redress. My\r\nattachment and pride were so great that I would not allow my friends to\r\ncall him to an account for his behavior; tho I now despise his conduct,\r\nand would refuse him the hand of which he has proved himself unworthy,\r\nstill I feel hurt at the treatment I have received. You, Sir, as a\r\nfriend to our sex, and one who wishes to preserve the peace of mind of\r\nunsuspecting girls, will do them an essential service, by your\r\nanimadversions on these facts, and guarding our sex from similar\r\nimpositions.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances would not have been related, were I not rendered\r\ndiscontented and wretched at home, in consequence of refusing the offers\r\nof three other gentlemen; either of whom would doubtless have been\r\nacceptable, had not my affections been preengaged to one who has proved\r\nhimself worthless. Their characters and situations in life are equal to\r\nmy wishes; but I cannot do them so much injustice and myself so much\r\ninjury, as to giv my hand unaccompanied with my heart. In consulting my\r\nown inclinations I have incurred the displeasure of all my family; they\r\ntreat me with great inattention, and are continually reflecting on my\r\nwant of spirit and resolution. I am confident, Sir, that every generous\r\nmind will pity your unhappy and distressed friend,\r\n\r\n          CONSTANTIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To_ CONSTANTIA.\r\n\r\nWhile I acknowlege myself honored by your correspondence, and happy in\r\nan opportunity of rendering you or your sex the least service, permit\r\nme, in compliance with your request, which shall be to me a sacred law,\r\nto offer my sentiments with a frankness, corresponding with that which\r\nmarks the relation of your misfortunes. For altho I feel the warmest\r\nindignation at every species of deception, and particularly at that long\r\ncontinued inexplicitness which is _deliberate deception_, and which is\r\nthe cause of your wretchedness, candor and truth require that censure\r\nshould fall where it is due.\r\n\r\nIf the slightest blame can fall on you, it is that you indulged the\r\nvisits of a gentleman for _eighteen months without an explicit and\r\nhonorable declaration of his intention_. A _delicate_, _affectionate_\r\nand _respectful_ attention to a lady, for one quarter of that period, is\r\nsufficient to make an impression on her mind, and decide her choice: At\r\nthe same time, it might not render an attachment on her part, so strong\r\nas to make a separation very painful; it might not giv the world an\r\nopinion that an engagement exists, or subject the lady to the necessity\r\nof dismissing other suitors. It is therefore prudent at least for a lady\r\nto conduct herself in such a manner as to bring her admirer to an\r\nexplicit declaration of his designs. A man of _real honor_ and principle\r\nwould not wait for a stratagem on the part of the lady, or for a frank\r\ndemand of an explanation of his conduct. A tolerable acquaintance with\r\nthe human heart would enable him to discover when a declaration would be\r\n_agreeable_ to the lady, and after this discovery, he would not keep her\r\na moment in suspense. A man of generous feelings, who has a lively\r\nattachment, looks with anxiety for some proof that his addresses are\r\nagreeable, and that a declaration of his intentions will be well\r\nreceived. No sooner does he find this proof, than he hastens to unbosom\r\nhimself to the dear object of his wishes, and communicate the happiness\r\nhe so ardently desires to receive. When therefore a man neglects such a\r\ndeclaration, after he has had convincing proofs that his offers would be\r\nwell received, it may and should be taken for granted that his\r\nintentions are not honorable, and the lady should treat him accordingly.\r\nIf therefore, my unhappy friend, you deserve the least degree of\r\ncensure, it is because you delayed too long to take measures for\r\nundeceiving yourself. Yet this delay is a proof of your unsuspecting\r\nconfidence and sincere attachment; and faults, proceeding from such\r\namiable causes, are almost changed to virtues; in your sex, they entitle\r\nthe sufferer to forgivness and to love.\r\n\r\nYou inform me, Constantia, that the man who has injured you, professed\r\nto _adhere to the rules of honor_. Never, Constantia, trust a man who\r\ndeals largely in that hackneyed virtue, _honor_. _Honor_, in the\r\nfashionable sense of the word, is but another name for _villany_. The\r\n_man of honor_ would not be guilty of the least impropriety in public\r\ncompany; he would not for the world neglect the least punctilio of the\r\ncustomary etiquette, but he would, without hesitation or remorse, blow\r\nout the brains of a friend, for treading on his toe, or rob an amiable\r\nwoman of her reputation and happiness to gratify his vanity.\r\n\r\nIf a man talks too much of his _honor_, he is to be avoided, like the\r\nmidnight ruffian. He that really possesses a virtue never boasts of it,\r\nfor he does not suspect the world think him destitute of it. Numerous\r\nprofessions are commonly mere substitutes for what is professed.\r\n\r\nThe man, who has given you so much uneasiness, never deserved the\r\nconfidence he won; he must be destitute of principle, of virtue, and of\r\nattachment to you. His deliberate ill usage proves him to be callous to\r\nevery tender emotion, and to deserve your contempt. Will not a generous\r\npride and detestation expel the least sentiment of respect for him from\r\nyour breast? Can you not forget that you have been misled, and will not\r\nyour innocence buoy you above misfortunes? That you have refused good\r\noffers, is to be regretted; but your friends, if they know the reason,\r\nas they ought, will not pain you by disingenuous reflections. On the\r\nother hand, they will assist you in finding objects to amuse you and\r\ndissipate your own melancholy reflections. Smile away the anxiety that\r\nshuts your heart against other impressions. Base as men are, there may\r\nbe some found who despise the character of him who has given even an\r\nhour's pain; there may be one who knows _your_ worth, and may be\r\ndisposed to reward your _constancy_.\r\n\r\nIt is a mortifying reflection to an honest mind, that _bad_ hearts are\r\nso often suffered to giv pain to the _good_; that the _trifling_ and the\r\n_base_ of our sex are not constrained, by necessity, to associate only\r\nwith the _trifling_ and the _base_ of yours, and that the good, the\r\ngenerous and the constant should be exposed to the abuses of the fickle\r\nand designing. But such is the constitution of society, and for the\r\nevils of it, we have no remedy, but cautious circumspection to prevent,\r\nor patient fortitude to support the adverse events of our conditions.\r\n\r\nNo man can entertain a more cordial detestation of the smallest\r\ndisposition to annoy the peace of mind and disturb the tranquillity of\r\nmankind, than myself; the design of existence here is to sooth the\r\nevils, and multiply the felicities of each other, and he must be a\r\nvillain indeed, who can deliberately attempt to poison the sources of\r\npleasure, by crossing and disappointing the social passions.\r\n\r\nTo your sex, Constantia, permit me to giv a word of caution; never to\r\nmake any inquiries about a man's family, fortune or accomplishments,\r\ntill you know whether he is a man of _principle_. By _principle_, I\r\nmean, a disposition of heart to conduct with strict propriety, both as a\r\nmoral being and as a member of civil society; that is, a disposition to\r\nincrease the happiness of all around him. If he appears to wish for his\r\nown gratification, at the expense even of a servant's happiness, he is\r\nan unsocial being, he is not a fit associate for men, much less for\r\namiable women. If he is a man of _principle_, then proceed to inquire\r\ninto his standing in life. _With_ principle he may make a woman happy in\r\nalmost any circumstances; _without_ it, _birth_, _fortune_ and\r\n_education_ serve but to render his worthlessness the more conspicuous.\r\nWith sentiments of esteem, I am your obliged friend, and humble servant,\r\n\r\n          E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXII.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, JULY, 1788.\r\n\r\n_A_ LETTER _to the_ AUTHOR, _with_ REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n          SIR,\r\n\r\nI beg leave to relate to you a few circumstances respecting the conduct\r\nof a young friend of mine in this city, and to request your own remarks\r\nand advice on the occasion. Should any other person similarly situated,\r\nbe disposed to receive benefit from the advice, I shall be much\r\ngratified, and my design more than answered.\r\n\r\nThis young friend to whom I allude, has been till within a few years,\r\nunder the watchful eyes of very attentiv parents; from whom he received\r\nmuch better advice and much more of it, than the generality of parents\r\nin this city are wont to bestow on their children; they taught him to\r\nregard truth with a steady attachment; in short his education, till\r\ntheir deaths, was such as might with propriety have been called rigidly\r\nvirtuous. Since that instructiv period, he has been under the guidance\r\nof no one but himself; his former associates with whom he grew up, and\r\nfor whom he still feels a degree of schoolmate attachment, are almost\r\nuniversally debauched characters. The force of example is great, and let\r\nit be mentioned to his honor, that in general he has had sufficient\r\nvirtue to resist their importunities, and to follow a line of conduct\r\ndirectly contrary to the one they would gladly have marked out for his\r\npursuance. He possesses many of the social virtues, and is warmly\r\nattached to the amiable part of the female world. This attachment has\r\npreserved him from the fashionable vices of the age, and given him a\r\nrelish for domestic happiness, which I think he will never lose. A young\r\ngentleman so capable of making himself agreeable to good and virtuous\r\ncharacters, ought not, in my opinion, to indulge himself in any\r\npractices, that shall tend in the least to depreciate his general merit.\r\nThe practices I would mention, are few and not very considerable; still\r\nI think he should dismiss them entirely, or at least not indulge them to\r\nhis disadvantage. He sings a _good song_, and he knows it tolerably\r\nwell; he is often urged into company on that account; he can make\r\nhimself agreeable withal, and is really a _musical companion_; he pays\r\nso much attention to _learning_ and _singing songs_, that he has but\r\nlittle leisure time on his hands; he reads part of the day, but he reads\r\nprincipally _novels_ or _song books_. I would not be understood to\r\nconsider _singing songs_ as criminal; far from it; I am often delighted\r\nwith a song from him; but the query with me is, whether he ought not to\r\ndevote part of the time which he now employs about what may be called\r\ngenteel trifling, to the improvement of his mind in a manner that may be\r\nof lasting benefit to him; I wish you to giv him your advice, and direct\r\nhim what books to read. He has another _fault_, which, altho it\r\noriginates in the benevolence of his disposition, may still be called a\r\nfault. He has a very susceptible heart, and opens it with a generous\r\nfreedom, so much so that he sometimes forgets himself, and opens it\r\nwhere he ought not to do. A stranger with a specious outside might\r\neasily impose on him. I just throw out these hints, that he may be on\r\nhis guard against those whose business it is to deceive. There are\r\nseveral smaller faults dependant upon, or rather consequent to, those I\r\nhave mentioned, which I at first intended to have enumerated, but if the\r\nfirst are amended, the others will forsake him of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The_ ANSWER.\r\n\r\n          SIR,\r\n\r\nBy the description you have given of your young friend, it appears that\r\nhe is rather _trifling_ and _inconsiderate_ than _profligate_. His\r\nfaults are, _his spending too much time in learning and singing songs_;\r\nand too _much frankness of heart_, which exposes him to impositions. But\r\nyou have not, Sir, informed me whether he was _bred to business_; and by\r\nhis character, I judge that he was not. He has had good precepts indeed;\r\nbut of how little weight are precepts to young people! Advice to the\r\nyoung sometimes does good; but perhaps never, except good habits have\r\nbeen previously formed by correct discipline in manners, or by a\r\nmechanical attention to honest employments. The truth is, advice or\r\nserious council is commonly lavished where it does no good, upon the\r\nyoung, the gay, the thoughtless; whose passions are strong, before\r\nreason begins to have the smallest influence. I am young myself, but\r\nfrom the observations I have hitherto made, I venture to affirm, that\r\ngrave advice never yet conquered a passion, and rarely has restrained\r\none so as to render a sprightly youth, in any degree serious. How should\r\nit? Instructions are transient; they seldom touch the heart, and they\r\ngenerally oppose passions that are vigorous, and which are incessantly\r\nurging for indulgence.\r\n\r\nI have ever thought that advice to the young, unaccompanied by the\r\nroutine of honest employments, is like an attempt to make a shrub grow\r\nin a certain direction, by blowing it with a bellows. The way to\r\nregulate the growth of a vegetable is to _confine_ it to the proposed\r\ndirection. The only effectual method perhaps is to keep young persons\r\nfrom childhood busy in some employment of use and reputation. It is very\r\nimmaterial what that employment is; the mind will grow in the direction\r\ngiven it at first; it will bend and attach itself to the business, and\r\nwill not easily lose that bent or attachment afterwards: The mind _will_\r\nattach itself to something; its natural disposition is to pleasure and\r\namusement. This disposition may be changed or overcome by keeping the\r\nmind, from early life, busy in some useful occupation, and perhaps by\r\n_nothing else_. Advice will not produce the effect.\r\n\r\nI suspect, Sir, that your young friend has been bred a trifler; that he\r\nhas had money to support him without the labor of acquiring it; that he\r\nhas never been anxious about his future subsistence. If so, his\r\neducation must be pronounced erroneous. Whether worth twenty pounds or\r\ntwenty thousand, it should make no difference in his attention to\r\nbusiness while young. We are the creatures of habit; a habit of\r\n_acquiring_ property should always precede the _use_ of it, otherwise it\r\nwill not be used with credit and advantage. Besides, business is almost\r\nthe only security we have for moral rectitude and for consequence in\r\nsociety. It keeps a young person out of vicious company; it operates as\r\na constant check upon the passions, and while it does not destroy them,\r\nit restrains their intemperance; it strengthens the mind by exercise,\r\nand puts a young person upon exerting his reasoning faculties. In short,\r\na man bred to business loves society, and feels the importance of the\r\nprinciples that support it. On the other hand, mankind respect him; and\r\nwhatever your young friend may think of the assertion, it is true that\r\nthe ladies uniformly despise a man who is always dangling at their apron\r\nstrings, and whose principal excellence consists in singing a good song.\r\n\r\nIf, Sir, your friend is still so young, as to undergo the discipline of\r\na professional or other employment, his habits of trifling may be\r\nchanged by this means; but if he is so far the gentleman as to disdain\r\nbusiness, his friends have only to whistle advice in his ears, and wait\r\ntill old age, experience, and the death of his passions, shall change\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nAccept of my thanks, Sir, for this communication, and be assured that my\r\nopinion on any subject of this kind will always be at your service.\r\n\r\n          E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXIII.\r\n\r\n                         BOSTON, MARCH, 1789.\r\n\r\n_An_ ENQUIRY _into the_ ORIGIN _of the_ WORDS DOMESDAY, PARISH,\r\nPARLIAMENT, PEER, BARON; _with_ REMARKS, NEW _and_ INTERESTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of my etymological investigations, I hav been led to\r\nsuspect that all the writers on the laws and constitution of England,\r\nhav mistaken the origin and primitiv signification of several words of\r\nhigh antiquity, and in consequence of the mistake, hav adopted some\r\nerroneous opinions, respecting the history of parliaments and trial by\r\npeers. Whether my own opinions are wel supported by history and\r\netymology, must be hereafter decided by able and impartial judges of\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\n_Dome book_, or _domesday book_, iz a word wel understood by English\r\nlawyers. _Dome book_, or _dom bec_, az it waz formerly spelt, waz the\r\nname given to the Saxon code of laws compiled by Alfred. Some other\r\ncodes of local customs or laws were also denominated _dom becs_, but\r\ntheze are all lost. After the conquest, a general survey of all the\r\nlands in England, except a few counties, waz made by order of William,\r\nand recorded in a volum which iz stil extant, and called _domesday_.\r\nThis survey waz begun by five justices assigned for the purpose in each\r\ncounty, in the year 1081 and completed 1086.\r\n\r\nOur pious ancestors were not a little frightened at the name of this\r\nbook, which iz usually pronounced _doomsday_; supposing it to hav some\r\nreference to the final doom, or day of judgement. In order to quiet such\r\napprehensions, lawyers of less credulity undertook to refute the common\r\nopinion. Jacob, after Cowel, very gravely asserts, that the termination\r\n_day_ in this word does not allude to the general judgement. \"The\r\naddition of _day_ to this dome book, waz not ment with any allusion to\r\nthe final day of judgement, az _most persons hav conceeved_, but waz to\r\nstrengthen and confirm it, and signifieth the judicial decisiv record,\r\nor book of _dooming_ judgement and justice.\"[67] The same author defines\r\n_domesmen_ to be _judges_, or men appointed to _doom_.\r\n\r\n    [67] _Jacob Dict._ word, _domesday_.\r\n\r\nCowel, a compiler of considerable authority, says, \"day or dey,\" (for\r\n_dey_ iz the true spelling) \"does not augment the sense, but only\r\ndoubles and confirms the same meening. It does not, in this composition,\r\nreally signify the mesure of time, but the administration of justice; so\r\nthat _domesday_ iz more emphatically the judicial decisiv record, the\r\nbook of _dooming_ judgement.\"[68] According to this author, then,\r\n_domesday_ iz _a judgement of judgements_, for he quotes Dr. Hammond to\r\nproov that _day_, _dies_, ημερα, in all idioms, signifies judgement.\r\nHowever tru this may be, I beleev our Saxon forefathers could find a\r\nbetter name for a code of laws, than _a judgement of judgements_.\r\n\r\n    [68] Cowel Dict. _Daysman_.\r\n\r\n\"_Domesday_,\" says Coke, \"dies judicii,\" day of judgement.[69] Such is\r\nthe influence of sounds upon credulous, superstitious minds.\r\n\r\n    [69] Coke Litt. 3. 248.\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be this; _domesday_ is a compound of _dom_,\r\njudgement, decree or authority; and _dey_, a law or rule.[70] Or\r\n_domes_, in the plural, may signify _judges_. The name of the book then\r\nwill signify, ether _the rules of judging_, or _deciding_, in questions\r\nrelating to the real property of England; or what is more probable, _the\r\nrules and determinations of the judges_ who surveyed the lands in the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n    [70] It iz singular that the last syllable of this word\r\n    _domesday_, should hav been mistaken for _day_, a portion of\r\n    time; for the latter in Saxon waz written _daeg_ and\r\n    _daegum_, az in the Saxon version of the Gospels; whereaz the\r\n    termination of _domesday_ waz formerly, and ought now to be,\r\n    spelt _dey_.\r\n\r\nThat _dom_ had the signification here explained iz capable of proof. The\r\nhomager's oath, in the black book of Hereford, fol. 46, ends thus, \"So\r\nhelpe me God at his holy _dome_ (judgement) and by my trowthe,\" (troth,\r\nthat is truth.)[71] This explanation coincides with the meening of the\r\nsame syllable in other languages, and confirms the hypothesis of the\r\ncommon origin of the languages of Europe, laid down in the Notes to my\r\nDissertations on the English Tung. We see the syllable in the Greek\r\nδαμαω, the Latin _dominus_, (domo) and in the English word _tame_; az\r\nalso in _doom_, _deem_, king _dom_.[72] In all theze words we observe\r\none primitiv and several derivativ significations. Its primitiv sense is\r\nthat of power or authority, az in Greek and Latin. In English, it stands\r\nfor jurisdiction, a judge, or a sentence. In _deem_, it denotes the act\r\nof the mind in judging, or forming its determinations.\r\n\r\n    [71] Cowel, Law Dict. _dome_.\r\n\r\n    [72] In some words _dom_ is substituted for the ancient\r\n    termination _rick_; and in one sense, it iz equivalent to\r\n    _rick_, which implies jurisdiction or power. _King rick_ waz\r\n    used az late az Queen Elizabeth: _Bishop-rick_ iz stil used,\r\n    denoting the territory or jurisdiction of a bishop.\r\n\r\nThe other syllable _dey_ iz probably the same word az _ley_, law, with a\r\ndifferent prepositiv article; for etymologists tel us, that the radical\r\nsyllable waz often found in the muther tung _ey_. Cowel informs us it\r\nwaz not _day_, but _dey_; and another author writes it _d'ey_. The word\r\n_daysman_, or az it ought to be spelt _deysman_, stil used both in\r\nEngland and America, is composed of _dey_ and _man_, and signifies an\r\narbitrator or judge, appointed to reconcile differences. In this country\r\nI hav often heerd it applied to our Savior, az mediator between God and\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe ancient lawyers translate the Saxon _dom bec_ and _domesdey_ by\r\n_liber judicialis_; words which seem not to convey the ful meening of\r\nthe original. I should translate them, _liber judicum_, the Judges book;\r\nor _lex judicum_, the Judges law or rule.\r\n\r\nThe old Saxon word _ley_, before mentioned, waz, in different dialects,\r\nor at different periods, written _ley_, _lah_, _lage_, _laga_. It iz\r\ndoubtless from the same root az the Latin _lex_, _lege_; and it is\r\nremarkable, that the same word anciently signified _peeple_; and from\r\nthis are derived _lay_ and _laity_, the peeple as opposed to the\r\n_clergy_.[73] It iz probable that the primitiv sense of the word, in\r\nremote antiquity, waz _people_; and az the peeple made the laws in\r\ngeneral assembly, so their orders or decrees came to be called by the\r\nsame name. This conjecture iz not groundless, and is no trifling proof\r\nof the ancient freedom of our Gothic ancestors. Tacitus says expressly\r\nof the Germans, \"De minoribus rebus principes consultant; de majoribus\r\n_omnes_.\" De Mor Germ. 11. The princes deliberate upon small matters, or\r\nperhaps decide private controverses of small moment; but laws of general\r\nconcern are enacted in an assembly of all the peeple.\r\n\r\n    [73] Johnson derives _lay_ from the Greek λαος; as he does\r\n    all other words which hav some resemblance to Greek words in\r\n    sound or signification. I beleev the Saxon or Gothic original\r\n    and the Greek may be the same, and of equal antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe origin of _Parishes_ haz puzzled all the lawyers and antiquaries of\r\nthe English nation. Johnson, after his usual manner, recurs to the\r\nGreek, and derives the word from παροικια, accolarum conventus, an\r\nassemblage or collection of peeple in a naborhood. Others content\r\nthemselves with deriving it from the Latin _parochia_ or French\r\n_paroisse_. These etymologies do not satisfy me. It is improbable that\r\nour ancestors went to the Greek for names of places or divisions of\r\nterritory, that existed in England az erly az the Heptarchy; especially\r\naz the Greek word before mentioned waz never used in the sense of\r\n_parish_. _Parochia_ cannot be the origin of parish; for it waz not a\r\nRoman word; on the other hand, it is merely a Gothic or Saxon word\r\nlatinized by the erly writers on law; and to derive _parish_ from the\r\nFrench _paroisse_ is trifling; for we might as well derive _paroisse_\r\nfrom _parish_, which iz at leest az ancient.\r\n\r\n\"It iz uncertain at what time England waz divided into parishes,\" say\r\nmost of the law writers. Camden, in hiz Britannia, page 104, says, the\r\nkingdom waz first divided into parishes by Honorius, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, in 636. This opinion iz controverted. Sir Henry Hobart\r\nthinks parishes were erected by the council of Lateran, in 1179. Selden,\r\nfollowed by Blackstone, supposes both to be rong, and shows that the\r\nclergy lived in common, without any distinction of parishes, long after\r\nthe time mentioned by Camden; and it appeers by the Saxon laws, that\r\nparishes were known long before the council of Lateran.[74]\r\n\r\n    [74] Blackstone Com. vol. I. 112.\r\n\r\nThe truth probably iz, the kingdom was not divided into parishes at any\r\none time, but the original ecclesiastical division grew, in a great\r\nmeasure, out of a prior civil division. _Parish_ iz the most ancient\r\ndivision of the ecclesiastical state, and originally denoted the\r\n_jurisdiction of a bishop_, or what iz now called a _diocese_. For this\r\nopinion, we hav the authority of the Saxon laws and charters. \"Ego\r\nCealwulfus, dei gratia rex Merciorum, rogatus a Werfritho, Episcopo\r\nHwicciorum, istam libertatem donavi, ut _tota parochia Hwicciorum_ a\r\npastu equorum, regis et eorum qui eos ducunt, libera sit, &c.\" Charta\r\nCealwulfi regis, Anno 872. \"Episcopus, congregatis omnibus clericis\r\ntotius _parochiæ_, &c.\" in a passage quoted by Cowel tit. _parish_. Here\r\nthe _bishoprick_ iz explicitly called a _parish_, parochia; and\r\nBlackstone remarks, \"it is agreed on all hands, that in the erly ages of\r\nchristianity in this island, parishes were unknown, or at leest\r\nsignified the same az a _diocese_ does now.\" Com. Vol. I. 112.\r\n\r\nThis, being a settled point, wil perhaps furnish a clue by which we may\r\nfind the true origin of the word and of the division.\r\n\r\nIt iz certain that there waz an ancient word among the Gothic nations,\r\nand probably among the Celtic, which signified originally _a man_,\r\nafterwards a freeman, or landholder, in opposition to that class of men\r\nwho had no real property. This word waz spelt by the Romans _vir_, and\r\nsignified _a man_, by way of eminence, az distinguished from _homo_; az\r\nalso a husband or householder. It answered to the ανηρ of the Greeks, az\r\ndistinguished from ανθροπος, a word denoting the human race in general.\r\nThe same word in the Gothic or ancient German waz spelt _bar_;[75] and\r\nprobably in some dialects _par_, for the convertibility of _b_ with _p_\r\niz obvious to every etymologist.[76] In the Erse language, az Mc Pherson\r\ntestifies, _bar_ signifies a man. The word iz also pronounced _fer_ or\r\n_fear_, which approaches nearer to the Latin _vir_: _Fergus_ or\r\n_Ferguth_ signifies a _man of word_ or command. In modern Welsh, which\r\niz the purest relict of the old Celtic, _bar_ is a son, and _barn_ a\r\njudge. In the ancient Irish, _brehon_ or _barhon_, which iz merely\r\n_baron_ with an aspirate, signified a judge. See Lhuyd, Mc Pherson,\r\nOssian, p. 4. and Blackstone's Commentaries, Vol. I.\r\n\r\n    [75] Camden's Britannia. _Baron._\r\n\r\n    [76] Let no one question the probability of such changes of\r\n    consonants which are formed by the same organs; for to this\r\n    day _b_ and _v_ are often used promiscuously. In the Spanish\r\n    language, we are at liberty to pronounce, _b_ az _v_, or _v_\r\n    az _b_; and with us, _marble_ is often pronounced _marvle_.\r\n    It is also certain that the Roman _vir_ is found in the word\r\n    mentioned by Cesar. Com. 11. 19. _Vergo bretus_, an annual\r\n    magistrate among the Ædui, a nation of Germany. This word is\r\n    derived from _vir_, and _guberno_, altho Cesar and Tacitus\r\n    never suspected it. The same word iz mentioned by Mc Pherson,\r\n    az stil existing in the Erst language, _Fergubreth_; and its\r\n    meaning iz the same az in Cesar's time: A decisiv argument\r\n    that _vir_, _fer_, and _bar_, are radically the same; and\r\n    that the ancient Celtic language had a common origin with the\r\n    Latin. A similar change of consonants iz observable in the\r\n    words _volo_ and _bull_ (the Pope's decree) which are\r\n    radically the same; az also the German _woll_ and the English\r\n    _will_. So the ancient _Pergamus_ iz called by the modern\r\n    Turks, _Bergamo_. See Masheim's Eccle. Hist. Vol. I. and my\r\n    Dissertations on the Eng. Language, Appendix.\r\n\r\nThis word iz the root of the modern word _baron_; for in ancient\r\nmanuscripts, it iz sometimes spelt _viron_, denoting its _derivation_\r\nfrom _vir_. For this we hav the authority of Camden and Du Cange under\r\nthe word _baron_.\r\n\r\nSo far we tred on sure ground. That theze words hav existed or do stil\r\nexist in the sense above explained, wil not be denied; and it iz almost\r\ncertain that they all had a common origin.\r\n\r\nThe word _Baron_ iz evidently derived from the German _bar_ or _par_,\r\nand under the feudal system, came to signify the proprietors of large\r\ntracts of land, or thoze vassals of the Lord Paramount, who held lands\r\nby honorable service.[77]\r\n\r\n    [77] The feudal system iz commonly supposed to hav originated\r\n    in the conquest of the Roman empire by the northern nations.\r\n    The rudiments of it however may be discovered az erly az the\r\n    Cimbric invasion of Italy, a century before the Christian\r\n    era. Se Florus. lib. 3. c. 3. The Cimbri and Teutones were\r\n    tribes of the same northern race, az the Germans and Saxons.\r\n\r\nI shall hereafter attempt to proov that several modern words are derived\r\nfrom the same root; at present I confine my remarks to the word\r\n_parish_, which, I conjecture, iz a compound of _par_, a landholder, and\r\n_rick_ or _rich_, which haz been explained, az denoting territory or\r\njurisdiction: _Parick_ or _parich_, the jurisdiction of a par or baron.\r\nIt iz true the words _baron_ and _parliament_ seem not to hav been used\r\namong the Saxons before the conquest; but they were used by most of the\r\nnations of the same original, on the continent; az in Germany, Burgundy,\r\nSweden and Normandy: And the use of the word _parochia_ in England,\r\nbefore the conquest, or at leest by the first lawyers and translators of\r\nthe Saxon laws, iz to me the strongest proof that some such word az\r\n_parick_ existed among the erly Saxons, or which waz latinized by thoze\r\nwriters. Even if we suppose the word borrowed from nations on the\r\ncontinent, my supposition of the existence of such a word iz equally wel\r\nfounded, for they all spoke dialects of the same tung.\r\n\r\nThe first knowlege we hav of the word _parish_ or rather _parochia_, iz\r\nin the Saxon laws, copied and translated into Latin by thoze erly\r\nwriters, Bracton, Britlon, Fleta, or others of an erlier date. In that\r\nerly period, _parochia_ waz a _diocese_ or _bishoprick_.\r\n\r\nI suspect the jurisdiction of the bishop waz originally limited by an\r\nerldom, county shire, or territory of a great lord. This waz probably\r\nthe general division; for sometimes a clergyman or bishop, in the zerude\r\nages, had cure of souls in two or more adjoining lordships; and it\r\noften happened that a lord had much waste land on hiz demesne, which waz\r\nnot comprehended in the original _parish_, and thus came, in later\r\ntimes, to be called _extraparochial_. But whatever particular exceptions\r\nthere might be, the remark az a general one, will hold true, with\r\nrespect to the original jurisdiction of a bishop.\r\n\r\nThe number of counties in England iz at present forty, and that of the\r\ndioceses, twenty four; but the number of counties haz been different at\r\ndifferent times; and some changes, both in the civil and ecclesiastical\r\nstate, hav doubtless, in a course of a thousand years, destroyed the\r\nprimitiv division. It iz however some proof of my hypothesis, that most\r\nof the bishops in England are stil called by the names of counties, or\r\nof cities which are shires of themselves; az the bishop of Durham, of\r\nWorcester, of London, of Norwich, &c. or by the names of the cheef towns\r\nin counties; az bishop of Winchester, of Chichester, &c.\r\n\r\nSelden's account of the ancient divisions of the kingdom, confirms this\r\nopinion. See Bacon's Selden, ch. 11. The province or jurisdiction of an\r\narchbishop, waz prior to the origin of diocesses or parishes. Selden haz\r\ngiven an account of a division of diocesses by archbishop Theodore in\r\nthe seventh century; by which it appears, that in some instances, a\r\ndiocese or parish waz one shire or county; and in others, a parochia\r\ncovered two, three, or more shires: But in almost every instance, the\r\nlimits of a parish were the limits of a shire or shires. And however\r\nstrange the reader may think it, the word _church_ and _shire_ are\r\nradically the same. The Saxon word waz _cyrick_ or _cyrk_;[78] and the\r\nScotch pronounce and write it _kirk_. It iz, like _shire_, derived from\r\nthe Saxon _Sciran_, cir, or _seyre_, to divide. The church or kirk waz\r\nthe ecclesiastical division, answering to shire, and come to signify the\r\njurisdiction of the cathedral church; the primaria ecclesia or mother\r\nchurch; and hence the Saxon term _cyrick sceate_, church scot or fees,\r\npaid by the whole diocese.\r\n\r\n    [78] So it iz spelt in the Saxon laws; but its root waz\r\n    probably _circe_, from _sciran_, to divide. _C_ before _i_\r\n    and _e_ was in Saxon pronounced _ch_ or neerly; hence _circe_\r\n    is _chirche_.\r\n\r\nIn later times, the original _parochia_ or diocese was divided or\r\nextended by the _Mickle-mote_, _Witenagemote_ or national assembly, by\r\nadvice of the bishops, nobles, and cheef men.\r\n\r\nFrom all I can collect respecting this subject, it appeers probable,\r\nthat on the first conversion of the Saxons to christianity, each\r\n_earle_, _earlederman_, or erl, whoze manor or jurisdiction waz the\r\norigin of a county, had hiz clergyman or chaplain to perform divine\r\nservice. Hiz residence waz probably in the vicinity of the erl; and this\r\nwaz the origin of the _cathedral_, or mother church, _primaria\r\necclesia_, to which the tenants of the whole district or erldom\r\nafterwards paid tithes. On the first establishment of theze churches,\r\nthe tenants paid tithes where they choze; but fraud or delay on the part\r\nof the tenant, and the encreasing power of the clergy, occasioned a law\r\nof king Edgar, about the year 970, commanding all the tithes to be paid\r\nto the mother church, to which the parish belonged.[79] This must hav\r\naugmented the welth of the cathedral churches, and given them a superior\r\nrank in the ecclesiastical state.\r\n\r\n    [79] Blackstone Com. vol. I, 112. That each shire had its\r\n    bishop, seems to be obvious from a law of Edgar, c. 5, where,\r\n    respecting the county court, it iz ordered, \"celeberrimo huic\r\n    conventui episcopus et aldermannus intersunto;\" not _unus\r\n    episcoporum_, but _the bishop_ and _erl_.\r\n\r\nPrevious, however, to this period, the _thanes_ or inferior lords, had\r\ntheir chaplains and private chapels; and it waz a rule, that if such\r\nchapel had a consecrated cemetery or burying ground belonging to it, the\r\nlord might appropriate one third of the tithes to the support of hiz\r\nprivate chaplain. The clerks or bishops who belonged to the cathedral\r\nchurches, and were the officiating ministers of the erls or princes, at\r\nthat time the first ranks of noblemen, acquired an influence in\r\nproportion to their property and the extent of their jurisdictions.\r\nHence the powers of modern bishops in superintending the clergy of their\r\ndioceses. In later times, they acquired large tracts of land, ether by\r\npurchase, gift or devise, and in right of their _baronies_ gained a seet\r\namong the lords of the kingdom in parliament.\r\n\r\nThe inferior clergy were multiplied in proportion az the peeple wanted\r\nor could support them, and the jurisdiction of an earl's chaplain, being\r\nlimited originally by his cure of souls, and being founded on a\r\n_parrick_ or territory of a lord, afterwards gave name to all the\r\njurisdictions of the inferior clergy. Hence the name of _parish_, as\r\ndenoting the extent of a parson's[80] ecclesiastical authority.\r\n\r\n    [80] _Parson_ iz said, by Coke and others, to be derived from\r\n    _persona_, because this officer represents the corporation or\r\n    church, _vicem seu personam ecclesiæ gerere_. This reezon\r\n    seems to be obscure and unsatisfactory. It iz possible the\r\n    word may proceed from the same root az _parish_, viz. _par_.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of a bishop lost the name of parish, parochia, at a\r\nvery erly period; but stil the subordinate divisions of the\r\necclesiastical state continued to be regulated by prior civil divisions.\r\nFor this assertion, we hav an indisputable authority, which confirms my\r\nopinion respecting the origin of parishes. \"It seems pretty clear and\r\ncertain,\" says the learned and elegant Blackstone, Com. vol. I, 114,\r\n\"that the boundaries of _parishes_ were originally ascertained by thoze\r\nof a _manor_ or _manors_; since it very seldom happens that a manor\r\nextends itself over more parishes than one, tho there are often many\r\nmanors in one parish.\" This iz the present state of facts, for\r\noriginally the parish, like the modern diocese, covered many manors, or\r\nestates of the inferior feudatories.\r\n\r\n_Parliament_ iz said to be derived from the French, _parlement_, which\r\niz composed of _parler_, to speak, and _ment_ or _mens_, mind. Cowel\r\ntit. _Parliament_.\r\n\r\n\"Parliament,\" says Johnson, \"parliamentuns, law Latin; parlement,\r\nFrench.\" Dict. fol. Edit.\r\n\r\n\"It is called parliament,\" says Coke Litt. p. 110. Ed. Lond. 1778,\r\n\"because every member of that court should sincerely and discretely\r\n_parler le ment_,\" (speek hiz mind) \"for the general good of the\r\ncommonwelth; which name it also hath in Scotland; and this name before\r\nthe conquest waz uzed in the time of Edward the Confessor, William the\r\nConqueror, &c. It waz anciently, before the conquest, called\r\n_michel-sinath_,[81] _michel-gemote_; _ealla_, _witena-gemote_; that is\r\nto say, the great court or meeting of the king and all the wisemen;\r\nsometimes of the king, with the counsel of hiz bishops, nobles and\r\nwisest of hiz peeple. This court, the French men call _les estates_; or\r\n_l'assemble des estates_. In Germany it is called a diet. For thoze\r\nother courts in France that are called _parliaments_, they are but\r\nordinary courts of justice, and az Paulus Jovius affirmeth, were first\r\nestablished with us.\"\r\n\r\n    [81] Great synod--great meeting.\r\n\r\nThe late editor of Cokes Institutes, remarks, in a note on this passage,\r\nthat the latter part of this etymology iz justly exploded, and\r\napologizes for hiz author by saying, \"it iz to be found in preceding\r\nauthors of eminence.\" He discards the _ment_, and considers it, not az\r\nan essential, but an adventitious part of the word; deeming it\r\nsufficient to derive the word from _parler_, to speak. This opinion he\r\nreceives from Lambard.\r\n\r\nSuch a definition, with great deference to theze venerable authorities,\r\niz a disgrace to etymology. Coke waz a great lawyer, and Johnson a good\r\nLatin and Greek scholar; but neether of them waz versed in the Teutonic\r\nlanguage and institutions, where alone we should look for the origin of\r\nour laws and the English constitution. Johnson indeed waz a mere\r\ncompiler of other mens etymologies, and Cowel, Selden, Junius and others\r\nfrom whom he copied, tho deeply lerned, sometimes fell into very\r\nwhimsical mistakes. I am bold to assert that the English derivation of\r\n_parliament_, or _parlement_ from the French _parler_, haz no better\r\nauthority than a mere whim or notion of theze writers. We might az well\r\nderive _parler_ from _parliament_, and both from a _parcel_ of gossips,\r\nbecause they are loquacious.\r\n\r\nThe true etymology of the word iz _par_, or _bar_, a landholder or\r\nbaron, and _le mote_, the meeting. I say _mote_, for this waz the Saxon\r\nspelling of the word, after the prepositiv _ge_ waz dropped. It waz\r\noriginally _gemote_, az in _witena-gemote_; afterwards the _ge_ waz\r\ndisused, az in _falk-mote_. What the original French orthography waz, I\r\nam not certain; but the word came to England from France, and we find\r\nthe French article prefixed, _par-le-ment; a meeting of the barons_. The\r\nsame sound waz used in Germany, Burgundy, and other parts of Europe, and\r\nin all, it had the same meening, which it, in some mesure, retains in\r\nFrance to this day.\r\n\r\nThe _commune concilium_ of England, before the conquest, consisted of\r\nthe _witena_, or wise men. It retained the name of _witena-gemote_, til\r\nafter the Norman invasion. It iz perhaps impossible, at this distance of\r\ntime, to ascertain exactly the manner of summoning this national\r\nassembly, or whether the commons or lesser nobility were entitled to a\r\nseet. In old charters, the king iz said to hav passed laws by advice of\r\nthe archbishops, bishops, abbots, erls and wise men of the relm;\r\nseniorum sapientium populi. But we are not able to determin whether\r\ntheze seniores sapientes were admitted on account of their age and\r\nwisdom; or whether possession of real estate waz a requisit\r\nqualification. So much iz certain, that in France and Germany, where we\r\nfirst heer of _parliaments_, all the _barons_, that iz, all the\r\nnobility, were entitled to a seet in the national council, in right of\r\ntheir baronys; and this iz asserted to hav been the case in England.[82]\r\nThis fact, so well attested in history az to be undeniable, ought long\r\nago to hav led the critical enquirer to the true origin of the French\r\nword, parlement. The name of parliament took its rise under the feudal\r\nsystem, when the assembly of men, so called, consisted solely of barons\r\nor bars. It iz from this circumstance that the provincial assemblies of\r\nFrance are properly denominated _parliaments_. The erly Norman princes,\r\nwho introduced the name into England, summoned none to their council but\r\nthe clergy and nobility, and sometimes a few only of the greater barons.\r\nThe house of lords iz strictly a _parliament_, according to the original\r\nof the word, altho since the commons hav made a part of the legislature,\r\nthe name iz extended to the whole body.\r\n\r\n    [82] Stuarts English Constitution, p. 275.\r\n\r\nThe word _peer_ iz said to be derived from the Latin _par_ equal; and\r\nthis circumstance haz been the occasion of innumerable encomiums on the\r\nEnglish _trial by peers_. So far az equality in the condition of judges\r\nand parties, iz an excellence in any judicial system, the present\r\npractice of trial by jury iz esteemable among a free peeple; for\r\nwhatever may be the origin of the word _peer_, a trial by men of the\r\nnaborhood may often proov a capital security against a court devoted to\r\nparty. But it iz at least doubtful whether _peers_, az used for jurors,\r\ncame from the Latin _par_; for it iz almost certain that the word\r\n_peer_, az used for nobles, iz derived from the German _par_, a\r\nlandholder, and this iz undoubtedly the tru primitiv sense of the word.\r\nThat there waz such a word in ancient Germany, iz unquestionable; and\r\n_paramount_, which signifies the lord of highest rank, iz from the same\r\nroot; _par-amount_, the _par_ or _baron above_ the rest. The jurists on\r\nthe continent latinized the word, calling the lords _pares_; and this,\r\nin later ages, waz mistaken for the plural of the Latin _par_.\r\n\r\nAz the pares or barons claimed almost exclusiv jurisdiction over their\r\nmanors, and held courts of justice, ether in person or by their\r\nbailiffs, they came to be considered az the supreme judges in the last\r\nresort of all civil and criminal causes. _Pares_ or _barons_ became\r\nequivalent to _judges_. Hence the _house of peers_ in England iz the\r\nsupreme judicatory of the nation. Hence the _parliaments_ (meetings of\r\npeers) in France are supreme courts of justice.\r\n\r\n_Twelv_ waz a favorit number with our Saxon ancestors, and the king, or\r\nlord paramount, with twelv judges, constituted the supreme court or\r\ncouncil among the ancient Germans. It will hardly be considered a\r\ndigression to examin this institution with more attention; for if I\r\nmistake not, the rudiments of it are visible az far back az the\r\nChristian era; or even az the Gothic migrations to the west and north of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIn the Edda, or system of Gothic mythology, compiled by Snorro\r\nSturleson, supreme judge of Iceland, about the year 1220, we may discern\r\nthe principles which would naturally giv rise to the practice of trial\r\nby _twelv men_. The Edda will indeed be said to be a collection of\r\nfables. To this I answer, fable iz generally, perhaps always, founded on\r\nfact; whatever additions may be made in a course of time by imperfect\r\ntradition. The Edda iz acknowledged to contain an authentic account of\r\nthe opinions of the northern nations at the time it waz written. This iz\r\nall I ask.\r\n\r\nSnorro, and Torfæus the historian of the north, inform us that even in\r\nScythia, \"Odin, the supreme god of the Goths, performed the functions of\r\ncheef preest, assisted by _twelv pontiffs, who distributed\r\njustice_.\"[83]\r\n\r\n    [83] Mallets North. Antiq. Vol. I. 61. The northern nations\r\n    had, like the Greeks, _twelv_ principal deities, and this\r\n    article in their religious beleef might originate the\r\n    institution of _twelv preests_, _twelv judges_, &c. Many\r\n    civil institutions among rude nations, may be traced to their\r\n    religious opinions; and perhaps the preference given to the\r\n    number _twelv_, in Germany, in Greece, and in Judea, had its\r\n    origin in some circumstances az ancient az the race of the\r\n    Jews.\r\n\r\n    _Odin_, which in Anglo Saxon, waz _Woden_, waz the supreme\r\n    god of the Goths, answering to the Jupiter of the Greeks: And\r\n    it iz remarkable that the words, _god_, _good_, _odin_ and\r\n    _woden_, all sprung from one source. We shall not be\r\n    surprized that the same word should begin with such different\r\n    letters, when we reflect that such changes are very common.\r\n    The Danes omit _w_ in _word_; a dictionary they call\r\n    _ord-bog_, a word book; and the Spaniards, in attempting to\r\n    pronounce _w_, always articulate _g_. See my Dissertations,\r\n    p. 335.\r\n\r\nLet us attend to a fact confirming the account. Mallet, a historian of\r\ncredit, testifies that the hall or seet of justice, may be stil seen in\r\ndifferent parts of Sweden and Denmark. \"Theze monuments, whoze rude bulk\r\nhaz preserved them from the ravages of time, are only vast unhewn\r\nstones, commonly _twelv_ in number, set upright, and placed in form of a\r\ncircle. In the middle iz a stone, much larger than the rest, on which\r\nthey made a seet for their king. The other stones served az a barrier to\r\nkeep off the populace, and marked the place of thoze whom the peeple had\r\nappointed to make the election (of king.) They treeted also in the same\r\nplace of the most important affairs.\"[84] There iz one neer Lunden,[85]\r\nin Scania, another at Leyra, in Zealand, and a third neer Viburg, in\r\nJutland.\r\n\r\n    [84] North. Antiq. Vol. I. 169.\r\n\r\n    [85] London, in England, probably had its name from this\r\n    place.\r\n\r\nThis being a well attested fact, we are disposed to beleev what iz\r\nrelated in the Edda, Fable 7th, where it iz asked, \"what the universal\r\nfather did when he bilt Asgard, (the divine abode.\") It iz answered,\r\nagreeable to the receeved opinion of the Goths, \"he in the beginning\r\nestablished governors, and ordered there to decide whatever differences\r\nshould arize among men, and to regulate the government in the plain,\r\ncalled Ida, wherein are _twelv_ seets for themselves, besides the throne\r\nwhich iz occupied by the universal father.\"[86]\r\n\r\n    [86] North. Antiq. Vol. II. 41.\r\n\r\nOn this passage, the translator of Mallets History haz the following\r\nnote. \"Theze judges were twelv in number. Waz this owing to there being\r\ntwelv primary deities among the Gothic nations, az there were among the\r\nGreeks and Romans? This I shall not take upon me to decide; but I think\r\none may plainly observe here the first traces of a custom, which hath\r\nextended itself to a great many other things. Odin, the conqueror of the\r\nnorth, established a supreme court in Sweden, composed of twelv members,\r\nto assist him in the functions of the preesthood and government. This\r\ndoubtless gave rise to what waz afterwards called the senate. And the\r\nsame establishment in like manner took place in Denmark, Norway, and\r\nother northern States. Theze senators decided in this last appeal, all\r\ndifferences of importance; they were, if I may say so, the assessors of\r\nthe prince; and were in number twelv, az we are expressly informed by\r\nSaxo, in hiz life of king Regner Lodbrog. Nor are other monuments\r\nwanting, which abundantly confirm this truth. We find in Zealand, in\r\nSweden, neer Upsal, and if I am not mistaken, in the county of Cornwal,\r\nlarge stones, to the number of twelv, ranged in the form of a circle,\r\nand in the midst of them, one of a superior height. Such in thoze rude\r\nages, waz the hall of audience; the stones that formed the\r\ncircumference, were the seets of the senators; that in the middle, the\r\nthrone of the king. The like monuments are found also in Persia, neer\r\nTauris. Travellers frequently meet there with large circles of hewn\r\nstones; and the tradition of the country reports, that theze are the\r\nplaces where the _caous_ or giants formerly held their councils.[87] I\r\nthink one may discover vestiges of this ancient custom, in the fable of\r\nthe _twelv peers_ of France, and in the establishment of twelv jurymen\r\nin England, who are the _proper judges_, according to the ancient laws\r\nof that country.\"\r\n\r\n    [87] See Chardin's Travels, Vol. III.\r\n\r\nIt iz certain that some outlines of this mode of deciding controversies\r\nby _twelv_, may be seen in the customs of the Cimbri and Teutones, long\r\nbefore the Christian era. But I cannot find that the idea of _equality_\r\never entered into the original institution. On the other hand, every old\r\nauthority that I hav consulted confirms me in the opinion, that the\r\n_twelv men_ were chosen from among the landholders or better classes of\r\npeeple; that they were the _judges_ of the court, and that the\r\ndistinction between judges and jury, law and fact, iz a refinement or\r\nimproovment on the original constitution, and comparativly of modern\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nIt iz certain that a difference of rank existed among the Germans in the\r\ntime of Tacitus. \"Reges ex nobilitate, duces ex virtute sumunt.\"[88] The\r\nsame writer expressly declares, that matters of inferior concern and\r\nprivate justice came within the jurisdiction of their _princes_. \"De\r\nminoribus rebus principes consultant, de majoribus, omnes.\"[89] In\r\nanother passage, he is more explicit: \"Principes jura per pagos vicosque\r\nreddunt.\"[90] Cesar iz still more explicit: \"Principes regionum atque\r\npagorum inter suos jus dicunt, controversiasque minuunt.\"[91] Theze\r\n_principes regionum atque pagorum_, Blackstone says, we may fairly\r\nconstur to be lords of hundreds and manors;[92] they were originally\r\nelectiv, az we are informed by Tacitus, \"eliguntur in conciliis\r\nprincipis,\" and each had a hundred comites, or assistant judges, who\r\nwere chosen from among the peeple. \"Centeni singulis, explebe comites,\r\nconcilium simul et auctoritas, adsunt.\"[93] Theze hundred assistants, or\r\ncompanions, were chosen _ex plebe_; but when chosen formed the\r\n_concilium principis_. The prince waz their president, chosen by\r\nthemselves, _eliguntur in conciliis principes_, and had _auctoritatem_,\r\nauthority or jurisdiction in the town or district.\r\n\r\n    [88] Tac. de Mor. Germ. c. 7.\r\n\r\n    [89] Tac. de Mor. Germ. c. 11.\r\n\r\n    [90] C. 12.\r\n\r\n    [91] De Bello Gallico. lib. VI. c. 21.\r\n\r\n    [92] Com. Vol. III. 35. This cannot be strictly true; for the\r\n    _principes_ were electiv; and therefore could not hav owned\r\n    the land (pagus) or exercised the office of judge in right of\r\n    their property. The kings, princes, and generals of the\r\n    ancient Germans were elected; some for their _nobility_, that\r\n    iz, the respectability of their families, arising from the\r\n    valor and merits of their ancestors; others, az their\r\n    _duces_, military commanders, were chosen for their\r\n    _virtues_, their personal bravery. This I take to be the\r\n    meening of that passage in Tacitus, \"Reges ex nobilitate,\r\n    duces ex virtute sumunt.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The _Comites ex plebe_,\" says Selden, chap. 18, \"made one\r\n    rank of freemen superior to the rest in wisdom.\" The Saxon\r\n    nobles were called _adelingi_, or wel born; the freemen,\r\n    _frilingi_, or free born; the latter might be assistants in\r\n    the judicial department. The lower ranks were called _lazzi_\r\n    or slaves; and indolence iz so necessary a consequence of\r\n    bondage, that this word _lazzi_, or _lazy_, haz become\r\n    sinonimous with _indolent_, _sluggish_. This word iz a living\r\n    national satire upon every species of slavery. But the effect\r\n    of slavery iz not merely indolence; its natural tendency iz\r\n    to produce _dishonesty_; \"almost every slave, being, says Dr.\r\n    Franklin, from the nature of hiz employment, a theef.\" Az a\r\n    striking proof of this, we may instance the change of meening\r\n    in the words _villain_ and _knave_, which at first denoted\r\n    _tenant_ and _plowman_, but during the oppressions of the\r\n    feudal system, come to signify, _a rogue_. _Vassal_ also\r\n    denoted originally, a _tenant_ or _feudatory_ of a superior\r\n    lord. It waz an honorable name, the barons being called the\r\n    kings _vassals_. But servitude iz to natural a consequence of\r\n    the tenure of lands under a proprietor, in see, that _vassal_\r\n    haz become sinonimous with slave.[c] The change of meening in\r\n    theze words iz a volum of instruction to princes and\r\n    legislators. Reduce men to bondage, and they hav no motiv but\r\n    feer to keep them industrious and honest, and of course, most\r\n    of them commence rogues and drones. Why hav not the tyrants\r\n    of Europe discovered this truth? Good laws, and an equal\r\n    distribution of the advantages and the rights of government,\r\n    would generally be an effectual substitute for the bayonet\r\n    and the gallows. Look thro Europe; wherever we see poverty\r\n    and oppression, there we find a nursery of villains. A\r\n    difference in the property, education and advantages,\r\n    originates the difference of character, between the nobleman\r\n    of nicest honor, and the culprits that swing at Tyburn.\r\n\r\n         [c] Blackstone, Vol. II. 52, says, \"we now uze the\r\n         word _vassal_ opprobriously, az sinonimous to slave\r\n         or bondman, on _account of the prejudices we hav\r\n         justly conceived against the doctrins grafted on\r\n         the feudal system_.\" So good a man ought not to hav\r\n         uzed the word _prejudice_; and so great a man ought\r\n         to hav assigned a better reezon for this\r\n         _opprobriousness_ of the modern word _vassal_.\r\n\r\n    [93] De Mor. Germ. c. 13.\r\n\r\nThe idea of equality iz no where suggested; on the contrary; the\r\nhundredors when chosen became a court or legislature in the district,\r\ncompetent to the general purposes of government. No mention iz made of a\r\ndistinction between the legislativ and judicial departments; on the\r\nother hand, we may safely conclude, from the passeges of Cesar and\r\nTacitus before quoted, that the powers of making laws and deciding\r\ncauses were vested in the same men. Cesar says, \"nullus est in pace\r\ncommunis magistratus,\" nor could the Germans, in their primitiv simple\r\nmode of living, need such a magistrate. The princes _jus dicunt,\r\ncontroversiasque minuunt_, distributed justice, by the assistance of\r\ntheir _comites_, and according to the circumstances of the peeple.[94]\r\nThis at leest waz the case with respect to matters of small magnitude.\r\n\r\n    [94] The practice of choosing assistant judges in the Roman\r\n    commonwealth, waz something similar to our mode of\r\n    impannelling a jury. Theze assistants were sometimes a\r\n    hundred, and it iz not improbable, the Roman and German\r\n    customs of electing that number might be derived from the\r\n    same original.\r\n\r\nThe Prætor, (cheef justice) or princeps judicum appointed by him,\r\nsummoned a number of persons, who were called _judices selecti_, select\r\njudges. Theze were to giv their verdict in criminal matters, like our\r\njuries. On the day of trial, the first thing after opening the court,\r\nwaz the _sortitio judicum_, or impannelling of the jury, performed by\r\nthe _judex quæstionis_ or cheef judge on the trial, who took by lot such\r\na number of the _judices selecti_, or jurymen, az the law, on which the\r\naccusation waz founded, had determined. Liberty waz given to the parties\r\nto reject, (challenge) and the places of thoze rejected, were filled by\r\nnew appointments.--_Kennetts Antiq. of Rome_, 138.\r\n\r\nThe number of _comites principis_, or assistants, waz originally a\r\n_hundred_. This gave name to the district which they governed, and which\r\nafterwards consisted of any indefinit number, still retaining the\r\nprimitiv name. In later ages, the number of assistant judges waz\r\nreduced; a grand jury still consists of twenty four; a petit jury\r\ncommonly consists of twelv, but on certain occasions, and by the custom\r\nof particular places in England, may be composed of sixteen, eight or\r\nsix.[95]\r\n\r\n    [95] See Coke Litt. and Hargraves notes on this subject.\r\n\r\nSuch waz the constitution of the ancient Germans, in which we may\r\ndiscover the principles of the system which they every where\r\nestablished, after their conquests in Gaul, Spain, Italy and Britain.\r\n\r\n_Twelv_ waz a favorit number, not only with the Saxons, but with all the\r\nnations of northern original. They had twelv principal deities; they\r\nnumbered the units up to _twelv_, instead of stopping at ten, like other\r\nnations;[96] they had twelv judges to assist their kings or princes;\r\ntheir hall for the election of their kings consisted of twelv huge\r\nstones, placed in a circle. Hence we discover the origin of the twelv\r\nsenators of Sweden,[97] Denmark and Norway; the twelv counsellors of\r\nstate in ancient times; the fable, az it iz called, of the twelv peers\r\nin France; the twelv judges in England, and the trial by twelv peers or\r\njurors, which waz formerly common to all the northern nations of\r\nEurope.[98]\r\n\r\n    [96] Mallets North. Antiquities.\r\n\r\n    [97] Mentioned in the preceding note, copied from Mallet.\r\n\r\n    [98] These facts gave rise to Cokes quaint remarks, \"that the\r\n    law delighteth herself in the number of twelv;\" and he adds,\r\n    \"the number of twelv iz much respected in holy writ; as 12\r\n    apostles, 12 stones, 12 tribes, &c.\" On juries, fol. 155.\r\n\r\nOn the Gothic establishments in the south and west of Europe, government\r\ntook a military complection. The kings parcelled out the conquered lands\r\namong their generals, called _duces_ or _principes_, by the Latin\r\nwriters; and by the Saxons, _heretoga_. The generals of first rank\r\nreceeved or acquired whole provinces, az Burgundy, and the\r\nprincipalities of Germany. Theze territories they distributed among\r\ntheir inferior officers and _comites_ or retainers, of whom every lord\r\nhad great numbers about hiz person. Theze constituted a secondary, but\r\nvery numerous class of nobility; and altho there might be differences of\r\nrank and property among them, they were called by one general\r\nappellation. In England, they were called _thanes_, from a word\r\nsignifying _to serve_, because they held their lands by the condition of\r\nmilitary service. On the continent, they were called _barons_, that is\r\nfreemen, or tenants of land, upon condition of rendering certain\r\nmilitary and honorable service to their superior lord, who waz called\r\nlord _paramount_.\r\n\r\nBlackstone remarks, that \"a baron's iz the most general and _universal_\r\ntitle of nobility; for originally every one of the peers of superior\r\nrank had also a barony annexed to hiz title.\"[99] The origin of this\r\ntitle haz occasioned great enquiry among antiquaries; but the difficulty\r\nvanishes upon my hypothesis, which derives the word from _bar_, a\r\nlandholder and freeman; for on the establishment of the feudal tenures,\r\nall the lands were held by a few men; the proprietors were all called\r\n_barons_, and this accounts for the _universality_ of the title just\r\nmentioned. Thus the bishops, after they had obtained gifts of large\r\ntracts of land or manors, resigned them to the conqueror, William;\r\naccepted them again subject to the conditions of lay fees, claimed rank\r\nwith the nobility, and took their seets in the English house of lords.\r\nActual possession of a barony waz originally requisit to constitute a\r\nlord of parliament; but the title iz now granted by the king without the\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n    [99] Com. Vol. I. 398.\r\n\r\nBlackstone mentions the difficulty of tracing the word _baron_ to its\r\nprimitiv sense; but confirms the foregoing explanation when he says,\r\n\"the most probable opinion iz that _barons_ were the same az our _lords\r\nof manors_.\"[100] The name indeed waz not used in England (so far as can\r\nbe collected from English writers) till after the conquest. But it iz\r\ncertain that the feudal system, tho not in all its severity, waz\r\nestablished in England before that period; and degrees of nobility were\r\ncotemporary with the Saxon establishments in the island. The first class\r\nwere called in Saxon _heretoga_, that iz generals or military\r\ncommanders. But the most ancient and perhaps the most important civil\r\ntitle waz that of _earles_ or _ealdormen_. Theze erls were called also\r\nin Saxon _schiremen_, for they exercised supreme jurisdiction in the\r\n_shires_. After the conquest they were called by the corresponding\r\nNorman title _counts_, from _comites_, because they were the king's\r\ncompanions in war; and their jurisdiction waz called a _county_.[101]\r\n\r\n    [100] Com. Vol. I. 399.\r\n\r\n    [101] I am by no meens certain that this derivation of\r\n    _counts_ from _comites_, iz just; it iz at leest az probable\r\n    az otherwise, that _contees_ may be a Gothic word. But this\r\n    iz conjecture.\r\n\r\nInferior to theze in rank were the Saxon _thanes_, who were so called\r\nfrom the Saxon _thanian_ ministrare, because they were the _comites_ or\r\nattendants of the ancient kings or earls. Theze were numerous, and after\r\nthe conquest called by the equivalent continental title, _barons_. Of\r\ntheze there were different ranks, _thani majores_ or _thani regis_, who\r\nserved the king in places of high importance, and took rank next to the\r\nbishops and abbots. Theze had inferior thanes under them, called _thani\r\nminores_, who were also _lords of manors_.[102] The word _peer_ I\r\nsuppose to be derived from the same root az _baron_, bar or par, and to\r\nbe equivalent in sense. It iz cleer to me that _landholder_, or man by\r\nway of eminence, waz its original meening; and that it iz a proper name\r\nof the ancient nobility, given them az proprietors of vast tracts of\r\nland, and that it had no reference to _equality_ of rank.\r\n\r\n    [102] See Cowel on the word _thane_; and in Domesday,\r\n    \"thanus, est tenens, qui est caput manerii.\"\r\n\r\nBut there are better proofs of this point than that drawn from this\r\nsupposed derivation. The true original signification of the word we hav\r\nin the phrases, _house of peers_, _peers of the relm_, _peerage_. And\r\nfor this assertion we hav the best authorities in the language. Cowel,\r\nfrom whom Johnson and most modern lawyers have borrowed their\r\ndefinitions of law terms, after explaining the word _peer_ az denoting\r\njurors, says expressly, \"but this word iz _most principally used for\r\nthoze that be of the nobility of the relm and lords of the parliament_.\"\r\nHere the author haz mentioned a well supported fact, and quotes ancient\r\nauthorities. But he immediately leevs fact, and runs into conjecture, az\r\nto the reezon of this appellation, which he deduces from a preconceeved,\r\nbut probably erroneous, opinion. \"The reezon whereof iz, that altho\r\nthere be a distinction of degrees in our nobility, yet in all public\r\nactions they are equal; az in their votes of parliament, &c.\" Here the\r\nauthor takes it for granted that the word _peer_ signifies _equal_, and\r\nassigns, az a cause of its _most principal_ appropriation to the\r\nnobility, that the men, tho of different ranks, hav an _equal vote_ in\r\nparliament. This a curious reason indeed! A man must be more credulous\r\nthan I am, to beleev this slight circumstance would giv rise to such a\r\nparticular appropriation of a name. One would think that the same reezon\r\nwould hav given the name to the clergy in convocation and other\r\necclesiastical courts. Yet the learned and candid Blackstone haz copied\r\nthe same reezon. \"The commonalty, like the nobility, are divided into\r\nseveral degrees; and, az the lords, tho different in rank, yet all them\r\nare _peers_ in respect of their nobility; so the commoners, tho some are\r\ngreatly superior to others, yet all are in law _peers_, in respect of\r\ntheir _want_ of _nobility_.\"[103] This appeers very extraordinary, that\r\nan _equality of suffrage_ should giv an appellation in preference to\r\n_difference of rank_, which iz, so much more obvious and more flattering\r\nto the haughty barons. But if the commoners are _peers_ or _equals in\r\nsuffrage_ az well az the lords; that iz, on the _same principle_; or as\r\nBlackstone states it, if the _lords_ are _peers_ because they are\r\n_noble_, and the commoners are _peers_, because they are _not noble_,\r\nwhy hav not the commoners the same appellations of _peers of the relm_?\r\nThe lords are not _equally_ noble, by Blackstone's own statement, for\r\nthey are of very different ranks; and the commons are not equally\r\n_ignoble_, (this word iz used merely for contrast) for they are of\r\ndifferent ranks: Yet the vote of one commoner iz az good in the house of\r\ncommons, az that of another; and the vote of one lord, in the other\r\nhouse, iz az good az that of another. If the _equality of suffrage_ iz a\r\nproper ground for the title of _peers_ in one house, the reezon extends\r\nto the other. Yet commoners are not _peers of the relm_; and until a\r\ngood reezon can be assigned for the distinction of titles between the\r\nhouses, I shall beleev that the word _peer_ had originally no reference\r\nto _equality_.[104]\r\n\r\n    [103] Com. Vol. I. 403. \"But the same author, in page 399,\r\n    says, the right of _peerage_ seems to hav been originally\r\n    territorial, that iz, annexed to lands, manors, &c. the\r\n    proprietors of which were, in right of thoze estates, allowed\r\n    to be _peers of the relm_;\" that iz, in plain English,\r\n    certain men, in right of their estates, were allowed to be\r\n    _equals_ of the relm. This will not pass for reezon and truth\r\n    on this side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n    [104] Horne, in hiz Mirror of Justices, chap. I. sect. 2.\r\n    says, \"altho the king ought not to hav any _peer_ (that iz,\r\n    _equal_) in the land, yet because he cannot be a judge in a\r\n    case where he iz a party, it waz behovefull by the law that\r\n    he should hav _companions_ to heer and determin of all writs\r\n    and plaints of all wrongs, &c. Theze companions are now\r\n    called _countees_, _earles_, according to the Latin\r\n    _comites_, &c.\" This iz singular! The king ought to hav no\r\n    _equal_; therefore he ought to hav _companions_ for judges;\r\n    or, in plainer words, if possible, the king ought not to hav\r\n    _equals_ in the kingdom, therefore he should hav _peers_ to\r\n    heer and determin criminal causes. Common sense at leest, if\r\n    not etymology, will say, \"the king ought not to hav _equals_,\r\n    but he must hav _judges_.\"\r\n\r\nBut say the English lawyers and antiquaries, \"the bishops are not in\r\nstrictness held to be _peers of the relm_, but only _lords of\r\nparliament_.\"[105] Why not? What is the distinction? Here our authors\r\nleev us in the dark; but perhaps the foregoing clu will leed us to the\r\nlight. Bishops were not the original proprietors of baronies; they were\r\nnot _bars_ or _pars_, the hereditary lords of manors, consequently not\r\n_peers of the relm_. This iz such an obvious solution of the question,\r\nthat I am surprized it should hav been overlooked. Under the papal\r\nhierarchy, the clergy gained vast influence over the minds of men, and\r\nby a variety of expedients, became possessed of large estates, and some\r\nof them, of ancient baronies. But their acquisitions were comparativly\r\nof modern date, and many of them usurpations, altho in consequence of\r\ntheir estates they obtained a seet in the house of lords. They are\r\ntherefore _lords of parliament_; but the ancient peers, priding\r\nthemselves upon the antiquity of their families, and claiming certain\r\nprescriptiv rights, would not admit the clergy to an equal share of\r\nauthority and honor; for to this day, a vote of the temporal lords iz\r\ngood against every vote of the clergy.[106]\r\n\r\n    [105] Blackstone, Vol. I. 157, from Staunford P C. 153.\r\n\r\n    [106] It iz now held that _e converso_, a vote of the\r\n    spiritual lords, if a majority, iz good against all the\r\n    temporal lords; but Coke douts it. Supposing this to be\r\n    admitted, the privilege is modern, and makes nothing against\r\n    my supposition.\r\n\r\n\"The appellation _peer_,\" says Cowel, \"seems to be borrowed from France,\r\nand from thoze _twelv peers_ that Charlemagne instituted in that\r\nkingdom.\" The same word waz used by other nations. Theze twelv peers\r\nconstituted a great council or supreme court, and the members were all\r\n_barons_, or of the nobility.[107] Can the word, applied to the members\r\nof this council, signify _equal_? By no meens. Here we trace the word\r\nto a remote period of antiquity, and find it used by the emperor of\r\nGermany; or at leest an appellation given to one of the first councils\r\nin hiz dominions. This iz the pure primitiv sense of the word _peers_,\r\n_barons_, that iz, in the full latitude of its signification, all the\r\nancient nobility; who held lands of him ether immediately or mediately;\r\nwho formed hiz supreme judicial court, and in some countries, hiz\r\nlegislativ assembly; who were hereditary councillors of the crown; and\r\ncheef _judges_ of all causes arising on their own manors, except such az\r\nwere of great consequence.\r\n\r\n    [107] It haz been remarked that _baron_ iz the most general\r\n    title of nobility; indeed every nobleman waz originally a\r\n    _baron_. Coke. I. 74. The lords of manors, both in England\r\n    and on the continent, were the suitors in the king's court,\r\n    and called _pares curtis_ or _curiæ_. The lords tenants were\r\n    called the _peers_ of hiz court baron. See Blackstone, Vol.\r\n    I. ch. 4.\r\n\r\nThis explanation accounts for what Selden has remarked, chap. 65, that\r\n\"the barons of England, before the reign of Edward I, were rather the\r\n_great_ and _richer sort_ of men, than _peers_, altho they were of the\r\nnumber.\" That iz, the Saxon thanes, who were great landholders, but\r\ninferior to the erls, had, after the conquest, receeved the appellation\r\nof _barons_ from the continent; but, being a secondary class of\r\nnobility, had not claimed or acquired the power and privileges of the\r\nGerman and French princes and nobles who had the title of _peers_, until\r\nthe Norman kings had introduced, into the kingdom, the oppressiv and\r\ninvidious distinctions of the feudal tenures, in the full extent of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIt will be enquired, if this iz the sense of the word, how came juries\r\nof common freeholders to be called _peers_? The answer iz eesy; the\r\njurors were the _judges_ of the inferior courts, and not merely the\r\nequals of the parties, az iz commonly supposed. The _erl_ or _baron_, in\r\nstrictness; but more commonly, the vice-comes, sheriff or lords deputy,\r\nwaz the president or cheef justice, and the jurors, the _assistant\r\njudges_. For this opinion, numberless authorities may be produced. The\r\nbarons were the assistant judges, _peers_, in the court of the lord\r\nparamount or king, and thus became judges by prescription; so the word\r\n_peer_ or _baron_, in time, became equivalent to _judge_. Az the nobles\r\nwere judges in the kings court, and decided on appeels in the last\r\nresort, so the freeholders who constituted the court in the county,\r\nhundred or manor, came to be denominated _peers_, that iz, _judges_.\r\n\r\nReeve, in hiz history of the English Law, remarks, that \"the\r\nadministration of justice in the days of William the conqueror, waz so\r\ncommonly attendant on the rank and character of a baron, that _baro_ and\r\n_justiciarius_ were often used _synonimously_.\" Blackstone says, \"it iz\r\nprobable the barons were the same az our lords of manors, to which the\r\nname of court baron (which iz the lords court, and incident to every\r\nmanor) givs some countenance.\" Vol. I. 398. It iz surprizing, theze\r\nwriters should approach so neer the tru original and meening of the\r\nword, _baron_, and not reech it.\r\n\r\nMost writers on the ancient state of government in Europe, hav remarked\r\nthat the nobility held the office of judges. \"Les mesmes comtes,\" says\r\nMezeray, \"et ducs, qui jugeoint les François, les menoient a la guerre.\"\r\ntom. I. p. 118. The counts and dukes were both judges and generals.\r\n\r\n\"Duo--comitum munera fure; unum videlicet justitiæ populis ministrandæ,\r\nalterum militiæ sibi subjectæ, quando in bellum eundum erat, educendæ\r\natque regendæ.\" Muratori. Antiq. Ital. tom. I. p. 399. The counts had\r\ntwo offices or departments of business; the administration of justice,\r\nand command of the troops in war.\r\n\r\nStuart, in hiz English Constitution, remarks, \"that the erls presided in\r\nthe courts of law. Their jurisdiction extended over their feefs: In all\r\ncauses, civil and criminal, they judged without appeel, except in cases\r\nof the utmost consequence.\" Part 3. Sect. 3.\r\n\r\nI presume it iz needless to multiply authorities. The strongest argument\r\nin favor of my opinions iz drawn from the supreme judiciary powers of\r\nthe house of lords in England. The lords are _peers_ of the relm; that\r\niz, the ancient prescriptiv judges or barons, who claim the privilege by\r\nhereditary right or immemorial usuage. The _house of peers_, iz\r\nliterally and in fact, _a house of judges_; an assembly of all the\r\nancient judges in the kingdom. So Selden relates of the Saxons, whom he\r\nsupposes to be descended from the same original az the Greeks, and long\r\nprior to the ages of Roman glory; \"their country they divided into\r\ncounties or circuits, all under the government of _twelv lords_, like\r\nthe Athenian territory under the Archontes. Theze, with the other\r\n_princes_, had the _judicial power of distributiv justice_ committed to\r\nthem, with a hundred commoners out of each division.\" Tit. Saxons. The\r\nsame writer declares, chap. 58, that the nobles \"were in their most\r\nordinary work, _meetings of judges_, or _courts of judicature_; that the\r\nking and hiz barons made many laws and constitutions which hav obtained\r\nthe name of statutes,\" (which he supposes may hav been equitable\r\ndecisions of new causes, which afterwards had the force of laws) \"that\r\nthe judges of this supreme court are the _baronage_ of England; and that\r\nthe house of lords still retain their supreme judiciary powers by\r\nancient prescriptiv right.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to this authority, I would remark that the modern supreme\r\njudiciary of Scotland iz copied almost exactly from the ancient Saxon\r\ntrial by laghmen or thanes. The lords of session, or president and\r\nfourteen judges, are a court of law and fact, without a jury; and this\r\niz exactly the _old_ trial by _peers_.\r\n\r\nThe parliaments in France are justly said by lord Coke, to be _ordinary\r\ncourts of justice_; another striking evidence of what I hav advanced.\r\nThe word _parliament_ came from France, where it denotes that assembly\r\nof barons, which constitutes the supreme _court of justice_ in each of\r\nthe several provinces. This iz the original import of the word, and the\r\nparliaments in France still retain that signification. This name waz\r\nintroduced into England, under the Norman princes, and superseded the\r\nSaxon name of the national assembly, _witena-gemote_. Indeed, during the\r\ndepression of the peeple, under the first princes of the Norman line,\r\nwhen the military tenures were established with rigor, national\r\nassemblies were called but seldom, and when summoned, consisted\r\nprincipally of the bishops and peers (barons) of the relm. They however\r\nacquired the name of _parliament_, and retain it to this day; altho one\r\nbranch of that body iz composed of commoners. The tru meening of\r\n_parliament_ iz a _meeting_ of _barons_ or _peers_, and their principal\r\nbusiness waz to decide controversies: They had original jurisdiction\r\nover causes in which the nobles were parties, az men of rank would not\r\nseek redress before an inferior tribunal; and they had an appellate\r\njurisdiction over other causes in the last resort. The parliament of\r\nEngland iz a legislativ body; but the _house of lords_ retains the\r\nprimitiv privilege of finally deciding controversies. This branch of the\r\nlegislature alone answers to the _parliaments_ in France, which approach\r\nneer the ancient institution.[108]\r\n\r\n    [108] The Norman princes might well call their councils\r\n    _parliaments_, _meetings of barons_; for they often summoned\r\n    none but the barons and clergy, and sometimes but a few of\r\n    the barons. Henry the third, once summoned but twenty five\r\n    barons of two hundred and fifty, then in the kingdom, and one\r\n    hundred and fifty of the clergy. Yet this meeting waz a\r\n    _parliament_. Selden, chap. 67.\r\n\r\nSo in England, the house of lords, and even the temporal lords alone,\r\nwere called formerly a _parliament_. Blackstone, b. IV, c. 19, upon the\r\nauthority of ancient books and records, repeetedly denominates the house\r\nof peers, when acting az a court of supreme judicature, a _parliament_,\r\na _full parliament_; and the spiritual lords are not permitted to giv\r\nany vote upon _gilty_ or _not gilty_, for they are not ancient _peers_\r\n(that iz, barons, prescriptiv judges) of the relm. It haz been douted\r\nwhether the spiritual lords had a right to sit in the house on the trial\r\nof a peer; but by a determination of the lords in the erl of Danby's\r\ncase, 1679, they were permitted \"to stay and sit in court in capital\r\ncases, till the court proceeds to the vote of gilty or not gilty.\" Still\r\nthey form no part of the court; the temporal lords constituting a _full\r\nparliament_, that iz, az I hav explained the tru primitiv meening of the\r\nword, _a meeting of barons or judges_.[109]\r\n\r\n    [109] Thoze who wish to see a more particular account of the\r\n    extensiv judicial powers of the barons in Europe, may consult\r\n    Robertson's Charles V. Vol. I. page 49, and note [Z] page\r\n    250, where the authorities are referred to.\r\n\r\nI would just add on this head, that the institution of _twelv judges_ in\r\nEngland, iz copied from the ancient mode of trial in Germany. The old\r\n_Curia Regis_ consisted of the king, hiz grand justiciary, the officers\r\nof hiz palace and _his barons_. This court followed the kings person\r\nwherever he went. Out of this were formed the several courts now\r\nestablished at Westminster. But the title of _barons of the exchequer_\r\nand _barons_ of the cinque ports, who are judges, furnishes an\r\nadditional argument in favor of my opinions.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing explanation of the words, _baron_ and _peer_, leeds to a\r\nprobable account of the _trial by peers_. It can be prooved that the\r\njurors were the _judges_ of the county, hundred and manor courts, and\r\nthe probability iz that the suitors in theze courts receeved the\r\nappellation of _peers_, from the circumstance of their being\r\nlandholders. Several authorities seem at leest to favor this opinion.\r\n\r\n\"Concerning the institution of this court by the laws and ordinances of\r\nancient kings, and especially of Alfred, it appeereth that the first\r\nkings of this relm had all the lands of England in demesne, and les\r\ngrand manors et royalties, they reserved to themselves; and of the\r\nremnant, they, for the defence of the relm, enscoffed the barons of the\r\nrelm, with such jurisdiction az the court baron now hath, and instituted\r\nthe freeholders to be _judges of the court baron_.\"[110]\r\n\r\n    [110] Coke Litt. 74. That the freeholders were judges iz tru;\r\n    but that the barons and freeholders derived their authority\r\n    from kings, iz wholly a mistake.\r\n\r\n\"The manor courts are of two sorts. The first iz by the common law, and\r\niz called the court baron, az some hav said, for that it iz the\r\nfreeholders or freemens court, (for _barons_ in one sense signifie\r\n_freemen_) and of that court the _freeholders_, being suitors, be\r\n_judges_. The second iz the copyholders court, which iz called a court\r\nbaron, because among the laws of king Edward the confessor, it iz said:\r\n\"Barones vero qui suam habent curiam de suis hominibus,\" taking the name\r\nof the baron who waz lord of the manor, or for that properly in the eye\r\nof the law, it hath relation to the _freeholders who are judges of this\r\ncourt_. And in ancient charters and records, the _barons_ of London and\r\nthe cinque ports do signify the _freemen_ of London and the cinque\r\nports.\"[111] Theze passages are express to my purpose. Indeed it must\r\nhav been that the freeholders, now called _jurors_, were judges; for the\r\nlord of the manor waz cheef judge or president merely, and we heer\r\nnothing, at this erly period of Saxon jurisprudence, of a distinction\r\nbetween law and fact.\r\n\r\n    [111] 1. Coke Litt. 73.\r\n\r\nHorne, in the Mirror of Justices, asserts[112] \"that by the\r\nconstitutions of Alfred, the free tenants in every county, hundred and\r\nmanor, were to meet together and _judge their nabors_.\" \"Every free\r\ntenant hath ordinary jurisdiction in theze courts.\" \"The lords and\r\ntenants shall incur certain penalties by the _judgement of the\r\nsuitors_.\" \"Theze courts are called county courts, where the _judgement\r\niz by the suitors_, if there be no writ, and iz by warrant of ordinary\r\njurisdiction.\" That iz, when there waz no special court held by the\r\njustices in eyre.[113] So also in a book called the \"Diversity of\r\nCourts,\" written in Henry the eighth's time, it iz said, \"in the court\r\nbaron the _suitors are the judges_, and _not_ the _steward_.\"\r\n\r\n    [112] Cap. I. Sect. III.\r\n\r\n    [113] He must speak of the state of things after the\r\n    conquest, otherwise _justices in eyre_ would not hav been\r\n    mentioned.\r\n\r\nCowel tels us, \"the court baron iz more properly _curia baronum_, i. e.\r\nthe court of _freeholders_, (for so barones does also signify) over whom\r\nthe lord of the manor presides. In this court the _freeholders are\r\njudges_.\"[114]\r\n\r\n    [114] Law Dict. _Court baron._\r\n\r\nSelden's authority confirms this fact. He says, \"neether waz the bishops\r\nnor sheriffs work, in the folk-mote or county court, other than\r\ndirectory or declaratory; for the _freemen_ were judges of the fact, and\r\nthe other did but _edocere jura populo_.\"[115] Here a distinction iz\r\ncleerly made beetween the _freemen_ and the _populus_; the freemen were\r\nthe judges, and the bishop or sheriff edocuit jura, proclaimed the\r\ndecision to the multitude. The freemen, or landholders, then were the\r\n_peers_ of the court; they were not the _equals_ of the multitude, for\r\nthe _populus_, the laborers of all descriptions, were considered az\r\nbelonging to an inferior class of men, and had no voice in the\r\nfolk-mote.\r\n\r\n    [115] Bacon's Selden chap. 24.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the whole, we hav the authority of the correct and judicious\r\nBlackstone, who expressly asserts, book III. chapters IV and V, that in\r\nthe court baron, the hundred court and county court, the freeholders or\r\nsuitors are _the judges_, and the steward in the two former, and the\r\nsheriff in the latter, are _the registrars or ministerial officers_. Now\r\nit iz well known that before the conquest, theze included _all the\r\ncourts_ that were in the kingdom, except the _witena-gemote_, in which\r\nthere waz nothing like a jury, separate from the members of that\r\ncouncil. So that the freeholders or jurors were not only _judges_, but\r\nthey were the _sole judges_ in all the inferior courts in the kingdom;\r\nand of course there could be little or no distinction between _law_ and\r\n_fact_. Nay, more, the suitors were the _witnesses_ also; and the\r\nprincipal reezon for summoning _freeholders of the vicinage_ waz\r\noriginally this; it waz supposed they were acquainted with the facts in\r\ndispute. Hence laws were made to compel the jurors to _tell the truth,\r\nif they knew the facts_, which waz always supposed, till the contrary\r\nappeered. In theze courts small causes were decided; and the county\r\ncourt had cognizance of ecclesiastical causes, az well az civil, and\r\noften determined disputes between the nobles, about real estates of\r\nimmense value.\r\n\r\nBut important matters were generally brought before the _witena-gemote_,\r\nor assembly composed of the king, bishops, erls and wise men. This waz a\r\nnational council, which united in itself all powers, legislativ,\r\njudicial, civil and ecclesiastical, in law and equity. Such a thing az a\r\njury waz never known in this supreme court. William the conqueror first\r\nseparated the civil from the ecclesiastical authority, and substituted\r\nthe _aula regiæ_, a high court, consisting of hiz cheef officers and\r\nbarons, in place of the Saxon _witena-gemote_. This court waz the\r\nsupreme judicature in the nation; a jury waz no part of it, and it\r\nfollowed the king wherever he went, till it waz fixed by Magna Charta in\r\nWestminster Hall. Afterwards, in the reigns of Henry III and Edward I,\r\nseveral courts were carved out of the _Aula Regis_; az the common pleas,\r\nthe court of kings bench, the exchequer and chancery courts; and it does\r\nnot appeer that a jury, distinct from the judges, formed any part of the\r\nimportant common law courts, till after this period. The distinction\r\ntherefore between judges and jury, law and fact, seems not to hav been\r\nknown, till the dissolution of the _Aula Regis_, at the cloze of the\r\nthirteenth century.\r\n\r\nLet us enquire what kind of men theze freeholders were, who were\r\nsummoned az jurors or judges at theze courts.\r\n\r\nLord Coke iz express, and quotes Glanvil and Bracton for authorities,\r\nthat \"in ancient times the jurors were _twelv knights_,\" (that iz,\r\nprobably, persons holding land amounting to a knights see.)[116]\r\n\r\n    [116] Some say this see waz eight hundred akers of land;\r\n    others, six hundred and eighty, or 20l. a year, which,\r\n    considering the difference in the value of money, waz equal\r\n    perhaps to 300l. or 400l. at the present time. Here seems to\r\n    be a confusion of ancient and modern ideas. The ancient\r\n    knights see waz a certain tract of land; in later times that\r\n    see was valued at 20l. in money.\r\n\r\nHenry III issued writs to the several counties to enquire into the\r\nliberties of hiz subjects, by _twelv good and lawful knights_.[117] The\r\nSaxon laws are more explicit. \"Habeantur placita in singulis\r\nwapentachiis, ut exeantur _duodecem thayni_ et præpositus cum eis, et\r\njurent super sanetuarium, quod eis dabitur in manu, quod neminem\r\ninnocentem velint accusare, vel noxium concelare.\"[118] Here the law of\r\nEthelred iz explicit in ordaining a court of twelve _thayni_, thanes or\r\nbarons, with their præpositus or president, who waz the officer of the\r\nhundred. Cowel remarks on this passage, \"that this may seem to intend\r\nthe number of _judges_, and not of the _jury_; but the jury themselves,\r\nin some cases, are judges, that iz, they are _judges_ of the _fact_, and\r\nthe judge iz bound to giv sentence according to their verdict.\" This\r\nwriter here supposes the _thayni_ to be really _jurors_ and _judges_;\r\nbut _judges_ only of the _fact_. This iz _the fundamental error_ of most\r\nlawyers who hav written on the subject; they take it for granted, that\r\nthe distinction of _law_ and _fact_ waz coeval with the trial by twelv\r\nfreeholders. Yet a single circumstance, mentioned by Cowel in the same\r\npage, with the passage quoted, might hav undeceeved him, which iz, that\r\n\"trial by jury waz anciently called _duodecem virale judicium_,\" the\r\n_judgement_ of twelv men. Their sentence or decision waz called a\r\n_judgement_; the distinction between the _verdict_ of a jury, and the\r\n_judgement_ of the court, waz unknown in the erly ages of the Saxons;\r\nnor can I find it mentioned, till after the conquest.\r\n\r\n    [117] Hale's Hist of Com. Law, 154.\r\n\r\n    [118] L L Ethel. c. 4.\r\n\r\nThis, and similar passages, hav however occasioned much dispute among\r\nother English lawyers and antiquaries. They hav adopted the opinion,\r\nthat a jury must consist of twelv equal commoners, and cannot explain\r\nwhat iz ment by summoning _twelv thanes_. \"Brady and Hicks,\" says\r\nStuart, \"contended that theze thanes were _not jurors_, but _judges_ or\r\n_lawyers_. Coke and Spelman were of a different opinion.\" The truth iz,\r\nthey were both _jurors_ and _judges_; and a knowlege of the tru primitiv\r\nsense of one little monosyllable in our language, would hav unravelled\r\nthe whole mystery to theze learned enquirers.\r\n\r\nThe most usual word for jurors, in the Saxon laws, iz _lahmen_ or\r\n_lagemen_; a word that haz puzzled the law writers, az it seems to meen\r\nsomething more than _equals_; and they hav no idea of any thing in a\r\njury, but _equality_. Hicks supposed them to be judges, \"duodeni jure\r\nconsulti,\" men versed in law. Spelman rendered the word, _legales\r\nhomines_, good and lawful men; very inadequate words indeed; but the\r\nerror haz been copied times without number, and still prevails. _Lahman_\r\niz literally a _law man_, man of the law, a judge. Law waz in a rude\r\nstate, at that period; but the thanes were both _lawyers_ and _judges_;\r\n_jure consulti_.[119] Professional distinctions could not be but little\r\nknown, amidst an unlettered peeple, who had few positiv laws, and fewer\r\nrecords and precedents; and the _lahmen_, the _seniores thani_, or\r\n_meliores viri_, az they were called, were summoned at certain times to\r\ndecide controversies, according to law, where a law waz provided;\r\notherwise according to their discretion. The decisions of theze _lahmen_\r\nwere held in esteem; many of them were preserved and handed down by\r\ntradition, and I hav no dout, theze, rather than statutes, gave rise to\r\nthe general and particular customs, which are called the common law of\r\nEngland.[120]\r\n\r\n    [119] We find by ancient records, that the clergy, before the\r\n    conquest, were sometimes summoned az jurors or judges in the\r\n    temporal courts.[d] But the _thanes_ were the most usual\r\n    judges in the courts baron. The proper Saxon name of this\r\n    court waz _halimate_ or _halmote, hallmeeting_; \"Omnis causa\r\n    terminetur vel hundredo, vel comitatu, vel _halimote_, socam\r\n    habentiam, vel dominorum curia.\"[e] And in W. Thorn, Anno\r\n    1176, the judges of this court are expressly said to be\r\n    thanes, \"_thanenses, qui_ in _Halimoto_ suo, in Thaneto,\r\n    omnia sua judicia exerceri,\" (debent.) Selden, chap. 47,\r\n    mentions a law of Henry I, which recites a custom of that\r\n    time, by which \"the _bishops_ and _erls_, with _other the\r\n    cheef men_ of the county, were present in the county court az\r\n    assistants in directory of judgement.\" Nothing can be more\r\n    explicit. And altho Selden, in a passage hereafter quoted,\r\n    mentions a compromise between Gunthrune, the Dane, and the\r\n    Saxon king, that men of a rank inferior to lords should be\r\n    tried by their _equals_, yet this inferior rank could extend\r\n    only to _freemen_; for others were never admitted upon\r\n    juries.\r\n\r\n         [d] See Selden, tit Sax. bishops.\r\n\r\n         [e] L.

I. c. 47.\r\n\r\nThis word iz found in domesday and in the laws of Edward the confessor.\r\nCowel quotes a passage from an ancient book, where Ulvet, the Son of\r\nForno, iz called _lagaman_ of the city of York, where, he says, it\r\ndoutless signified some cheef officer, az judge or recorder. Thoze who\r\nhad _socam_ et _sacam_, or jurisdiction over the persons and estates of\r\ntheir tenants, were the _thanes_ or barons; and this iz agreed by\r\nLambard, Somner, Coke, Cowel, and most writers on law.[122] Lambard,\r\nwhoze authority iz very respectable, speeks of a jury thus: \"In singulis\r\nCenturiis comitia sunto, atque liberæ conditionis viri duodeni ætate\r\nsuperiores unà cum præposito, sacra tenentes juranto, &c.\" Of a jury\r\n_per medietatem linguæ_, he says, \"Viri duodeni _jure consulti_, Angliæ\r\nsex, Walliæ totidem, Anglis et Wallis jus dicunto.\" Fol. 91. 3. Here\r\nLambard not only describes jurors az men of _free condition_ and\r\nrespectable for age, but az _jure consulti_, the _judges_ of the court;\r\nand _jus dicunto_; they were men who administered law and justice. This,\r\nit appeers from all ancient testimonies, waz the uniform practice among\r\nthe Saxons. The jurors were twelv _thanes_ or men of free condition;\r\n_lahmen_, _jure consulti_, or judges, and constituted the _court_; with\r\nthe præpositus, or proper officer of the district, az their president,\r\nwho sat az the deputy of the erl, in the county court; the deputy of the\r\nlord of the manor, in the court baron; or az the cheef magistrate of the\r\nhundred. And one source of error in understanding this ancient\r\ninstitution, haz been the wrong translation of _lahman_, by Spelman and\r\nothers, who rendered the word, _legalis homo_; a good and lawful man.\r\nThe meening iz not so indefinit az a _lawful man_, which could not be\r\nredily understood or explained. Rude nations do not deal in such vague\r\nideas. The meening iz, _man of law_, whoze business it waz to know the\r\nlaw and administer justice.[123]\r\n\r\n    [122] _Laghman_, to this day, iz the name of a judge or\r\n    magistrate, both in Sweden and Iceland. In theze countries it\r\n    retains its primitiv and tru English meening.--Mallets North.\r\n    Antiq. Vol. I.\r\n\r\n    [123] Selden waz forced to confess the _jure consulti_ and\r\n    _ætate superiores_, so often mentioned in the Saxon laws, az\r\n    composing the homage or jury of twelv, to hav been _cheef men\r\n    both for experience and knowlege_. To such as _stumble at\r\n    this conceet_, as he expresses it, he remarks that the work\r\n    of jurors requires them to be cheef men, az they _judge of\r\n    matter of fact_; (a reezon drawn from the modern notions of\r\n    jurymen's province.) And he adds, the jurors, who were\r\n    co-assessors, with the bishop or sheriff in the court, were\r\n    seeted in the most eminent place, and might hav held it to\r\n    this day, az they do in Sweden, had the _cheef men_ still\r\n    holden the service. But the great became negligent of such\r\n    public duties, and left the business to thoze of a meener\r\n    condition, who would not or durst not take the bench; and\r\n    therefore took their seets on the floor--(took separate\r\n    seets.) He says further, that the Danes, on their settlement\r\n    in England, would not associate with men of this condition;\r\n    so that a compromise took place between Alfred, the Saxon\r\n    king, and Gunthrune, the Dane, by which it waz decreed, that\r\n    a lord or baron should be tried by twelv lords, and one of\r\n    inferior rank, by _eleven of his equals_ and _one lord_. This\r\n    waz in the case of homicide only; tho afterwards the law\r\n    might extend to other cases and civil suits. By hiz own\r\n    account of the matter, this writer supposes the trial by\r\n    _twelv_ waz originally a trial by the _cheef men_, (_thanes\r\n    lahmen_) and the idea of equality waz never suggested in the\r\n    practice till the ninth or tenth century. But juries existed\r\n    az courts for centuries before; and the word _peers_ iz\r\n    acknowleged to hav had its origin on the continent, where it\r\n    signified the lords or members of the high court instituted\r\n    by Charlemagne. In modern use, trial by _peers_ iz trial by\r\n    equals _generally_; for men are mostly become freemen and\r\n    landholders; but this waz not the primitiv practice; nor was\r\n    _equality_ the basis of the institution. Even if we suppose\r\n    the word peer to hav signified _equal_, as uzed originally on\r\n    the continent, it extended no privilege on that account to\r\n    the body of the nations where it waz used; for it ment only\r\n    the _kings equals_, hiz _comites_, hiz dukes, erls and\r\n    barons, among whom he waz merely _primus inter pares_. In\r\n    England Bracton, who wrote under Henry III, declares the king\r\n    waz considered in this light; and that the \"_erls and barons\r\n    are his associates_, who ought to bridle him, when the law\r\n    does not.\"[f] The courts then which Charlemagne instituted in\r\n    France and Germany, consisted merely of the kings _peers_ or\r\n    _equals_; and in theze countries, the courts remain mostly on\r\n    the ancient footing; so that none but the nobility can be\r\n    tried by their _equals_. In this sense of the word therefore\r\n    juries were not used in England, till the compromise between\r\n    Alfred and Gunthrune, about the year 900. Before that period,\r\n    the jurors were not called or considered az _equals_; but\r\n    they were _thanes_, _jure consulti_, _lahmen_ and\r\n    _clergymen_. A distinction afterwards took place, and lords\r\n    were tried by _their_ equals, and commoners by _theirs_.\r\n\r\n         [f] L. I. c. 16.\r\n\r\nBut if we suppose the word to meen _legalis homo_, and that the only\r\nrequisit in a juror, iz freedom; or that he should be _liber homo_; this\r\nwould exclude a vast proportion of the English nation from the\r\nprivilege. I know that Magna Charta repeetedly mentions theze freemen,\r\n_liberos homines_, and secures to them certain rights, among which iz,\r\ntrial _per pares suos_, which I suppose to hav been originally, _by\r\ntheir judges_; altho at this period, the idea of equality in the\r\ncondition of judges might hav prevailed: And indeed the _freemen_ were\r\nmostly tried by men of equal rank. I am sensible also that the modern\r\nconstruction of Magna Charta extends this privilege to every man in the\r\nrelm of England; _omnis liber homo_ iz said to comprehend every English\r\nsubject. I rejoice that by the struggles of a brave peeple, this\r\nconstruction of that compact haz actually taken effect in a\r\nconsiderable degree. But I cannot think all the English nation were\r\ncomprehended in the words of the instrument; or that the privilege of\r\n_trial by peers_ waz extended, or ment to be extended, to all the\r\npeeple. Magna Charta waz merely a convention between the king and hiz\r\nbarons, assembled at Runing-mead; and the laboring part of the peeple,\r\ndebased by servitude under an oppressiv aristocracy, seem hardly to hav\r\nbeen in the contemplation of the parties. The villeins, rustics, or\r\ntenants at will, who probably composed a majority of the peeple, had one\r\nprivilege indeed secured to them: It waz stipulated that they should not\r\nbe deprived, by fine, of their carts, plows, and other instruments of\r\nhusbandry; that iz, they should not be deprived of the meens of laboring\r\nfor their masters. Further than this, a large proportion of the English\r\nwere not noticed in Magna Charta, but were considered az a part of\r\ntheir lords property, and transferable, like moveables, at their\r\nplezure.\r\n\r\nThe _freemen_, or thoze classes of peeple which came within the\r\ndescription of _liberi homines_ in that famous convention, were the\r\nnobility and clergy tenants _in capite_, or such at most az had a life\r\nestate in lands, and could serve on juries. The lazzi, villeins, or\r\nmodern copyholders, were not at that time capable of serving; they were\r\nbelow the rank of freemen; they had not the right of trial by peers,\r\neven in the common acceptation of the word; nor were they admitted to\r\nthe privilege till the reign of Richard III. Multitudes of them are not\r\n_peers_ of _the commons_, even on the principle of equal suffrage, for\r\nthey hav not the property requisit to qualify them for the privilege of\r\nvoting at elections. Blackstone's assertion therefore, that every\r\nsubject of the kingdom haz a right by Magna Charta, to trial by hiz\r\nequals, cannot be tru, for vast numbers of the nations are not, and\r\nnever were, entitled to be jurors. But in the sense I understand and hav\r\nexplained the word, every man haz a right to _trial by hiz peers_; that\r\niz, by freeholders of the vicinity, who are _his judges_. The propriety\r\nof calling them _hiz judges, pares suos_, iz discovered in the gradation\r\nof courts established in England. The _peers of the relm_, or barons,\r\nwere originally the suitors or judges in the kings court, where alone\r\nthe nobility were tried; hence the barons were always tried by _their_\r\njudges, _pares suos_. The clergy, the thanes of the lower class, or\r\nother freeholders who had life estates in lands, were the suitors in the\r\ncourts of the counties, the hundreds and manors. Theze were the _judges_\r\nof theze courts, and called _peers_. The freemen might be said to be\r\ntried by their _equals_; but the villeins were not; yet both were tried\r\nby _their_ peers; that iz, by the peers of theze inferior courts, who\r\nwere exclusivly _the judges_.[124]\r\n\r\n    [124] \"The division of the county waz done by _freemen_, who\r\n    are the _sole judges thereof_.\"[g] Selden, Matthew, Paris,\r\n    and others, testify that the _folk-mote_, peeple's meeting or\r\n    county court, waz a county parliament, invested with\r\n    legislativ or discretionary powers in county matters. In\r\n    theze small districts, they appeer to hav been competent to\r\n    decide all controversies, and make all necessary local\r\n    regulations. The legislativ, judicial and executiv powers,\r\n    both civil and ecclesiastical, were originally blended in the\r\n    same council; the witena-gemote had the powers of a\r\n    legislature, of a court of law, and of a court of equity over\r\n    the whole kingdom, in all matters of great and general\r\n    concern. But this court waz composed of lords, bishops, and\r\n    _majores natu_ or _sapientes_, men respected for their age\r\n    and lerning, who were of the rank of _freemen_. All the\r\n    freemen were bound also to do suit in the lords court, and to\r\n    attend the _folk-mote_ on the sheriffs summons; but _twelv_\r\n    were usually selected to sit az judges in common cases.\r\n\r\n         [g] Selden on the authority of Polydore.\r\n\r\n    The cast powers of the county court, when the freeholders\r\n    were all summoned and actually sat in judgement, may be\r\n    understood by two facts. One, the conquerors half-brother,\r\n    and Lanfrank, archbishop of Canterbury, had a dispute about\r\n    certain lands and tenements in Kent. The archbishop\r\n    petitioned the king, who issued hiz writ, and summoned the\r\n    freemen of the county, to take cognizance of the suit. After\r\n    three days trial, the freemen gave judgement for the\r\n    archbishop, and the decision waz final.\r\n\r\n    In like manner, two peers of the relm, a Norman and an\r\n    Italian, submitted a title in fifteen manors, two townships,\r\n    and many liberties, to the freeholders of the county, whose\r\n    judgement waz allowed by the king.[h]\r\n\r\n         [h] Selden. Chap. 48.\r\n\r\nFrom what haz been advanced on this subject, if we may rely on\r\nsubstantial authorities, and at leest probable etymologies, the\r\nfollowing conclusions may be safely deduced. That in ancient Germany,\r\nthe _principes pagorum et regionum_, with a certain number of\r\nassistants, originally a hundred, sometimes twenty four, but commonly\r\ntwelv, elected by the peeple, (not _pro re nata_, but for a stated\r\nperiod) formed a council (concilium) for the government of a district:\r\nThat in their military expeditions, the _duces_, or generals, had their\r\n_life guards_, or comites, who attached themselves to the person of\r\ntheir cheef, and fought by hiz side:[125] That theze retainers, in some\r\nof the Teutonic dialects on the continent, were called _barons_, az they\r\nwere called _thanes_ by the Saxons in England: That after the irruption\r\nof the northern nations into the south of Europe, the conquered lands\r\nwere divided among the great officers and their retainers, az fees or\r\nstipendiary feuds, on the honorable tenure of military service: That the\r\nprinces, erls and barons, hav been, from time immemorial, the assistant\r\njudges in the kings courts, and eech of them, a cheef judge, with power\r\nof holding courts, on hiz own demesnes: That parliaments on the\r\ncontinent were _assemblies of barons_, and originally _courts of\r\njustice_, az they are still in France: That the word _peers_ waz first\r\nused on the continent, to denote the members of this supreme judicial\r\ncourt, and in its primitiv sense, az derived from _bar_ or _par_, it\r\nsignified freemen or landholders; and thence came to denote _judges_,\r\nwho were originally the proprietors of lands or manors: That this latter\r\nsense iz its tru meening, whether applied to the house of lords or to a\r\ncommon jury, who were anciently the _judges_ of the inferior courts, and\r\nare still, in many cases, judges of law az well az fact, notwithstanding\r\nthe modern distinction, which haz taken place in consequence of an\r\nextensiv and vastly complicated system of jurisprudence: That the house\r\nof lords in England retains the primitiv sense of the word _peers_, az\r\nwell az the original right of _judging_ in the last resort, and this\r\nhouse alone iz a _parliament_, according to the ancient meening of the\r\nword on the continent: That the _freemen_ mentioned in Magna Charta and\r\nall the old law writers, were thoze who held their lands by honorable\r\nservice, for term of life, or had estates of inheritance; and that the\r\nlazzi, villiens or bondmen, who constituted the major part of the\r\nnation, were not comprehended under the words _liberi homines_, were not\r\nentitled to be jurors themselves, and consequently could not be tried by\r\ntheir _equals_: That the twelv jurors among the Saxons were the _cheef\r\nmen_ of the county and judges: That the idea of _equality_ in the jurors\r\nor judges waz introduced by the pride of the nobility, and the humble\r\ncondition of their tenants, under the invidious distinctions of ranks\r\ncreated by the feudal system: That this idea however haz been the meens\r\nof preserving the rights of both in England; while the nations on the\r\ncontinent, having been less successful in their struggles, and not\r\nhaving wrested the _right of judging_ from the barons, the original\r\n_peers_ or proprietors of that right, hav not acquired a privilege,\r\ninestimable in a country where distinctions of rank prevail, and do not\r\nenjoy the blessings of equal liberty: That this privilege haz been\r\nconsiderably extended in England, by the abolition of military tenures,\r\nand the diffusion of property among the commons: But that America haz\r\ngiven the privilege its utmost extension, by making laws of inheritance\r\nthat enable _every man_ to be a freeholder; thus reducing the English\r\ntheory to practice, and entitling every man literally to the right of\r\n_trial by hiz equals_.\r\n\r\n    [125] \"Magnaque et comitum æmulatio, quibus primus apud\r\n    principem suum locus; et principum, cui plurimi et acerrimi\r\n    comites.\"[i] The princes kept az many of these retainers in\r\n    their service in time of peace, az they could support. \"Hæc\r\n    dignitas, hæ vires, magno semper elestorum juvenum globo\r\n    circumdari, in pace, decus, in bello, præsidium. Ibid.\"\r\n\r\n         [i] Tacitus de mor Germ. c. 13.\r\n\r\nHow far theze conclusions are supported by the foregoing authorities and\r\narguments, every reeder will judge for himself. I hav ventured my\r\nopinions with my usual frankness, in opposition to thoze of the sages of\r\nthe law, which hav been receeved for centuries. The vast weight of\r\nauthority, and long established prepossessions of men in favor of a\r\ndifferent theory, make me diffident of my own opinions on this subject;\r\nbut there are many passages in ancient law writings, and many customs\r\nand laws still existing in the English constitution and government,\r\nwhich I cannot explain and reconcile on any other hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of trial by peers, in ancient times, appeers to me to hav\r\nconsisted in this; that twelv indifferent men of the naborhood, with the\r\npower of judges, were the guardians of life and property against the\r\nrapacity of the lord of the manor or hiz deputy. It iz a fact well known\r\nthat _sheriffs_, the deputies of the erls, were in several counties\r\nhereditary officers; but when they were not, they had almost-unlimitted\r\npowers in the shire, which they often abused to oppress the peeple.\r\nUnder the feudal system they appeer to hav been almost absolute tyrants;\r\nand the undue exercise of their powers, probably gave rise to thoze\r\narticles of Magna Charta, which declare, that \"no freeman shall be\r\ntaken, imprisoned, or diseized of hiz freehold, liberties, or free\r\ncustoms, but by the lawful judgement of hiz peers, or by legal process;\r\nthat sheriffs should not hold county courts above once a month; that\r\nsheriffs, castellans, coroners, and kings bailiffs, should be restrained\r\nfrom holding pleas of the crown; that sheriffs, who had the management\r\nof the crown revenues, within their several districts, should not raize\r\nthe farms of counties, hundreds and tythes, according to their plezure.\"\r\nTheze provisions were evidently designed to remedy actual evils; the\r\nviolence and usurpations of the executiv officers, who acted under the\r\nking, or the great lords, with powers almost uncontrolled.[126] Against\r\nsuch petty tyrants, the revival or confirmation of the right of trial by\r\ntwelv freeholders of the vicinage, must hav been a capital security: But\r\nfreeholders alone could be impannelled on a jury; _freeholders_ alone\r\ncould be diseized of _freeholds_; consequently the privilege of being\r\ntried by _equals_, could extend to freeholders only. With respect to all\r\nothers, the excellence of the institution could not consist in the\r\n_equality of condition_ in the jurors; but in having twelv substantial\r\nfreemen, impartial, independent men, unaccustomed to oppression, to\r\ncheck and control the ministers of justice.\r\n\r\n    [126] In the time of Henry II, there were in England eleven\r\n    hundred and fifteen castles, and az many tyrants az lords of\r\n    castles. William of Newbury says, in the reign of Stephen,\r\n    \"Erant in Anglia quodammodo tot reges, vel potius tyranni,\r\n    quot domini castellorum.\" It waz the tyranny of theze lords\r\n    or their deputies, which rendered the intervention of twelv\r\n    judges of the naborhood, highly necessary to preserve the\r\n    peeple from the impositions of their rapacious masters. Hence\r\n    the privilege of this mode of trial derived an inestimable\r\n    valu.\r\n\r\nSince the separation of court and jury, law and fact, juries, in civil\r\ncases, hav become of less consequence. Judges are appointed by the\r\nrepresentativs of the peeple, ether in legislature or some other form,\r\nand are removeable for misbehavior. They are usually az good judges of\r\nfact as a jury, and better judges of law. One state[127] haz a statute\r\nempowering the parties to submit fact az well az law to the court. This\r\nplaces the court on its Saxon institution, except az to the number of\r\njudges. It iz also a common practice for the parties to agree on the\r\nfacts, and submit the law to the court. The practice supersedes a jury.\r\nOn commercial questions an ordinary jury are altogether unfit to decide;\r\nthey are incompetent judges, because commerce iz regulated by peculiar\r\nlaws, best known by merchants. Hence the institution of chambers of\r\ncommerce, and the practice of referring causes to arbitrators of the\r\nmercantile profession.\r\n\r\n    [127] Connecticut.\r\n\r\nBut the principal valu and excellence of juries are preserved in\r\ncriminal causes. Judges, by long custom, become hardened in the business\r\nof condemning, and may sometimes pronounce sentence, which, even when\r\nlegal, may be unnecessary. Jurors, less accustomed to the cruel task,\r\nretain thoze feelings which sometimes pleed against evidence, in favor\r\nof humanity, and soften the rigor of penal laws.\r\n\r\nI shall cloze theze remarks with two quotations from very respectable\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nWhat Camden haz collected concerning the word _baron_, serves to\r\nillustrate and confirm my opinions on this subject; and the reeder will\r\nbe pleezed with the following passage from his Britannia, Vol. I, page\r\n238.\r\n\r\n\"Among the greater nobility, the barons hav next place. And here, tho I\r\nam not ignorant what the lerned write concerning the signification of\r\nthis word in Cicero; yet I am willing to cloze with the opinion of\r\nIsidore, and of an ancient grammarian, who will hav _barons_ to be\r\nmercenary soldiers. This seems to be pretty plain from that known place\r\nof Hirtius in the Alexandrian war; \"they run to the assistance of\r\nCassius; for he always used to hav _barons_, and a good number of\r\nsoldiers for sudden occasions, with their weapons reddy, about him, and\r\nseparate from the rest.\" Nor iz the old Latin and Greek Glossary against\r\nus, when it translates _baro_ by ανηρ a man; az always in the laws of\r\nthe Longobards, _baro_ iz used for a man.\r\n\r\nThe etymologies of this name which some hav fancied, do not by any meens\r\nplease me. The French heralds will hav barons to be so called from\r\n_par-hommes_ in French; that iz, of equal dignity; the English lawyers\r\nsay it iz from _robora belli_, the sinews of war; some Germans think it\r\na contraction of banner-heirs, i. e. standard bearers; and Isidore\r\nderives it from bareis, i. e. grave or weighty. Alciatus thinks the name\r\ncomes from the _berones_, an ancient peeple of Spain, which he says were\r\nformerly stipendiaries; but that other, from the German _bar_, i. e. _a\r\nfree man_, pleezes me better.\r\n\r\nThe precise time when this name came into our island, I hav not yet\r\ndiscovered: The Britons disown it; and there iz not the leest mention\r\nmade of it in the Saxon laws, nor iz it reckoned in Alfrick's Glossary\r\namong the titles of honor; for there, _dominus_ iz translated _laford_,\r\nwhich we hav contracted into _lord_. And among the Danes, the free\r\nlords, such az our barons are at this day, were called thanes, and (and\r\naz Andreas Velleius tells us) are termed so still. In Burgundy, the use\r\nof this name iz very ancient;[128] for Gregory of Tours says thus, \"the\r\nbarons of Burgundy, az well bishops az others of the laity, &c.\" The\r\nfirst mention of a baron in England, that I hav met with, iz in a\r\nfragment of the laws of Canutus, king of England and Denmark, and even\r\nthere, according to different copies, it iz read vironus, baronus, and\r\nthani. But that the barons are there ment, iz plain from the laws of\r\nWilliam the conqueror; in which that word in the laws of Canutus iz\r\ntranslated by _baro_. Take the whole passage. \"Let the exercitals[129]\r\nbe so moderated, az to be tolerable. An erl shall provide such things az\r\nare fitting, eight horses, four saddled and four unsaddled; four steel\r\ncaps, and four coats of mail; eight javelins,[130] and az many shields;\r\nfour swords, and two hundred mancae[131] of gold. But a kings _viron_ or\r\n_baron_, who iz next to him, shall hav four horses, two saddled and two\r\nunsaddled; two swords, four javelins, and az many shields, one steel\r\ncap, and fifty mancae of gold.\"\r\n\r\n    [128] About the year 580.\r\n\r\n    [129] Heriots or reliefs.\r\n\r\n    [130] Lancæe.\r\n\r\n    [131] Possibly for _Mancusæ_, i. e. thirty pence.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the Norman times, the valvasors and thanes were\r\nreckoned in order and dignity, next to the erls and barons, and the\r\ngreater valvasors (if we may beleev thoze who hav written concerning\r\nfeudal tenures) were the same that barons are now. So that baro may seem\r\nto hav come from that name; which time haz, by little and little, made\r\nsomewhat smoother. But even then it was waz not a title of any great\r\nhonor; for in thoze times there were erls who had their barons under\r\nthem: And I remember, I hav red in the ancient constitutions of France,\r\nthat there were ten barons under one erl, and az many cheeftans[132]\r\nunder a baron. It iz likewise certain, that there are charters since the\r\nNorman conquest, wherein the erls write thus: \"To all my barons, az well\r\nFrench az English, greeting, &c.\" Nay, even citizens of the better rank\r\nwere called _barons_; so in domesday book the citizens of Warwick are\r\nstiled _barons_; and the citizens of London, with the inhabitants of the\r\ncinque ports, had the same title given them. But a few years after, az\r\nsenators of Rome were chosen according to their estates, so they were\r\naccounted _barons_ with us, who held their lands by an entire barony, or\r\nthirteen knights fees, and one third of a knights fee, every fee (az we\r\nhav had it in ancient book) being computed at twenty pounds, which in\r\nall make four hundred marks; for that waz the value of one entire\r\nbarony; and they who had land and revenues to this value, were wont to\r\nbe summoned to parliament. It seems to _hav been a dignity, with\r\njurisdiction, which our court-barons in some mezure show.[133] And the\r\ngreat number of barons iz an argument that they were such lords who\r\ncould hold pleez within their own jurisdiction_, (like thoze whom the\r\nGermans call free-heirs) especially if they had their castles; for then\r\nthey answered the definition of Baldus, the famous lawyer, who calls him\r\na baron, that had a mere and mixt government in some castle, by the\r\ngrant of the prince. And (az some would hav it) all who held baronies,\r\nseem to hav claimed that honor; so that some of our lawyers think, that\r\nbaron and barony, erl and erldom, duke and dukedom, king and kingdom,\r\nwere in the nature of conjugates. It iz certain, that in that age, king\r\nHenry III, reckoned one hundred and fifty baronies in England. From\r\nhence it iz, that in the charters and histories of that age, almost all\r\nnoblemen are stiled barons; a name, which in thoze times waz exceeding\r\nhonorable; the baronage of England including in a manner all the prime\r\norders of the kingdom, dukes, marquisses, erls and barons.\r\n\r\n    [132] Capatanei.\r\n\r\n    [133] This opinion of the lerned Camden, adds no small weight\r\n    to my conjectures reflecting the origin of trial _per pares_.\r\n\r\nBut that name haz been much more honorable since king Henry III, out of\r\nsuch a multitude, which waz seditious and turbulent, summoned to\r\nparliament by writ, some of the best[134] only; \"for he,\" (the words are\r\ntaken out of an author of considerable antiquity) \"after thoze great\r\ndisturbances and heart-burnings between himself, Simon de Montefort, and\r\nother barons, were laid; appointed and ordained, that all such erls and\r\nbarons of the kingdom of England, to whom the king should vouchsafe to\r\ndirect hiz writs of summons, should come to hiz parliament, and no\r\nothers, unless their lord the king should pleeze to direct other writs\r\nto them also.\" And what he began a little before hiz deth, waz strictly\r\nobserved by Edward the I, and hiz successors. From that time they were\r\nonly looked on as barons of the kingdom, whom the king by such writs of\r\nsummons had called to parliament; until Richard the II, in the eleventh\r\nyear of hiz reign, created John de Beauchamp of Holt, baron of\r\nHerderminster, by the delivery of a diploma, bearing date the tenth of\r\nOctober. From which time, the kings hav often conferred that honor by\r\ndiploma, (or rather honorary letters) and the putting on of an honorary\r\nlong robe. And that way of creating barons by diploma, and the other of\r\nwrits of summons, are in use at this day; tho they are mentioned therein\r\nnot by the name of _baron_, but of _chevalier_. They who are thus\r\ncreated, are called barons of parliament, barons of the kingdom, and\r\nbarons honorary, to distinguish them from thoze who are commonly called\r\nbarons according to the ancient constitution; az thoze of Burford and\r\nWalton, and such az were barons to the counts Palatine of Chester, and\r\nof Penbroch, who were feudal, and barons by tenure only.\"\r\n\r\n    [134] Optimos.\r\n\r\nThis account of Camden's, iz alone sufficient to convince me, that my\r\nopinions are right respecting the origin and signification of the word\r\n_baron_. But this author cleerly mistakes the meening in the passage\r\nquoted from Hirtius. \"Cassius used to hav _barons_, and a good number of\r\n_soldiers_, for sudden occasions.\" Insted of mercenary soldiers,\r\n_barons_ here meens the _comites_, retainers, who were chosen men, and\r\nwho served their cheef voluntarily. Theze attached themselves to the\r\nperson of the cheef, az a military guard; at the same time, they served\r\nto gratify the pride of the hero: Hæc dignitas, hæ vires, says Tacitus.\r\n\r\nI hav before remarked that it iz probable _bar_ and _vir_ are the same\r\nword. Camden tells us, the Greek Glossary translates _baro_ by ανηρ, and\r\nin the laws of William, the Norman, the _vironus_, _baronus_ and\r\n_thanus_, found in the laws of Canute, are translated by _baron_ or\r\n_viron_. _B_ and _v_ are convertible letters, and theze facts amount to\r\na convincing proof that _bar_ and _vir_ are the same word, or from the\r\nsame root. The progress of the word iz this. First it denoted a man or\r\nhusband, _vir_; afterwards a freeman or proprietor of land, _bar_,\r\n_baron_, _viron_; in proportion az the valu of lands encreesed in\r\nEurope, the proprietors acquired welth and influence; they claimed\r\nexclusiv judicial powers on their manors, and thus the words _baron_ and\r\n_peer_ came to signify _judge_. Under the feudal system, theze barons\r\nbecame princes on their territories, subordinate only to the king or\r\nlord paramount. Power attends property, and theze barons finally assumed\r\nthe right of controlling kings, and trampling on their tenants. Where\r\nthe barons and princes combined, they established despotic authority\r\nover the peeple; when they quarrelled, one party or the other had\r\nrecourse to the commons for assistance, and waz compelled to grant them\r\nconsiderable privileges.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing explanation of _baron_ iz confirmed by another fact now\r\nexisting. In law, a _husband_ iz called _baron_ to this day, _baron_ and\r\n_femme_, husband and wife. Agreeable to this idea, the terms used in\r\nancient infeudations by the tenant or vassal, were, _devenio vester\r\nhomo_; I become your _man_; that iz, your _baron_, in the feudal sense\r\nof the word. And a jury, in conformity with the same idea, were\r\nanciently called _homagium_, the _homage_, or manhood; that iz, a court\r\nof _barons_, landholders or free tenants.\r\n\r\nI would only remark further, that Camden iz probably mistaken in saying\r\nthe Britons disown the word _baron_. In Welsh, _barn_ signifies a judge,\r\nand there can be little dout that the word iz from the same original;\r\nbeing written without the vowel _o_, agreeable to the Hebrew manner.\r\n\r\nDifferent nations are more or less inclined to uze the vocal sounds and\r\naspirates, according to the different genius of their languages. So in\r\nIrish the word waz pronounced with an aspirate, _barhon_, or _brehon_;\r\nfor there iz little room to dout this old Irish word iz from the same\r\nroot. At the time of the conquest of Ireland by Henry II, the Irish were\r\ngoverned by the _brehon law_, so stiled from _brehon_, the Irish name of\r\njudges.[135] We are also told that the ancient Irish had a custom of\r\ndeciding causes by _twelv_ men[136]; and authors testify that the same\r\npractice existed in ancient Britain.[137] Their decision iz called by\r\nthe erly writers, _duodecem virale judicium_. In short the universality\r\nof this word and the trial by twelv, iz a strong proof, that all the\r\nnations of Europe sprang from a common stock.[138]\r\n\r\n    [135] Blackstone Com.

Hoeli.\r\n\r\n    [138] See my Dissertations on the English language, 313.\r\n\r\nSir William Temple derives _barons_ from the Russian _boiarons_, and\r\nsupposes the word to be of Gothic original. Hiz only inaccuracy iz, that\r\nhe takes a modern derivativ for the primitiv root; whereas the Russian\r\n_boiarons_ itself iz derived from _bar_, az wel az _baron_. The\r\nauthority of this judicious and lerned writer wil however confirm what I\r\nhav advanced in the foregoing pages; I shal therefore cloze my remarks\r\nwith a passage from hiz works, vol. III. 363.\r\n\r\n\"I know very well how much critic haz been employed by the most lerned,\r\naz Erasmus, Selden, Spelman, az well az many others, about the two words\r\n_baro_ and _feudum_; and how much pains hav been taken to deduce them\r\nfrom the Latin and Greek, and even the Hebrew and Egyptian tungs; but I\r\nfind no reezon, after all they hav said, to make any doubt of their\r\nhaving been both the original of the Gothic or northern language; or of\r\nbarons having been a term of dignity, of command, or of honor, among\r\nthem, and feudum of a soldier's share of land. I find the first used\r\nabuv eight hundred years ago, in the verses mentioned of king Lodbrog,\r\nwhen one of hiz exploits waz to hav conquered eight _barons_. And tho\r\nfees or feuda were in use under later Roman emperors, yet they were\r\nderived from the Gothic customs, after so great numbers of thoze nations\r\nwere introduced into the Roman armies. Az to the word _baro_, it iz not,\r\nthat I find, at all agreed among the lerned, from whence to derive it;\r\nbut what that term imports, it iz easy to collect from their several\r\naccounts, and confirm by what stil remains in all the constitutions of\r\nthe Gothic government. For tho by _barons_ are now ment in England such\r\naz are created by patent, and thereby called to the house of lords; and\r\n_baron_ in Spanish signifies only a man of worth or note, and the\r\nquality denoted by that title be different in the several countries of\r\nChristendom; yet there iz no question, but they were originally such\r\npersons az, upon the conquest of any country, were, by the conquering\r\nprince, invested in the possession of certain tracts or proportions of\r\nfree lands, or at leest az they held by no other tenure but that of\r\nmilitary service, or attendance upon their prince in war with a certain\r\nnumber of armed men. Theze in Germany, France, Scotland, seem to hav\r\nhad, and some stil to retain, a sovereign power in their territories, by\r\nthe exercise of what iz called high and low justice, or the power of\r\njudging criminal az well az civil causes, and inflicting capital\r\npunishments. But I hav not found any thing of this kind recorded in\r\nEngland, tho the great barons had not only great number of knights, but\r\neven petty barons holding under them.\r\n\r\nI think the whole relm of England waz, by William the conqueror, divided\r\ninto baronies,[139] however the distinctions may hav been long since\r\nworn out; but in Ireland they still remain, and every county there iz\r\ndivided into so many baronies, which seem to hav been the shares of the\r\nfirst barons. And such as theze great proprietors of land, composed, in\r\nall the north west regions (of Europe) one part of the states (estates\r\ngeneral) of the country or kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n    [139] This iz not accurate. The thaneships or lordships of\r\n    the Saxons, at the conquest, took the title of _baronies_;\r\n    but the divisions probably existed before.\r\n\r\nSir William Temple proceeds then to giv hiz conjectures respecting the\r\norigin of the word _baron_. He remarks that Guagini, in hiz description\r\nof Sarmatia, printed in 1581, calls all thoze persons who were cheef\r\npossessors of lands and dignities, next to the prince, duke or palatine,\r\nin the vast empire of Muscovy, by the common appellation of _boiarons_,\r\nnow contracted into _boiars_. From this he supposes _baron_ to be\r\nderived. It iz however much more probable that _baron_ and _boiaron_ had\r\na common root in some period of remote antiquity; which afterwards\r\nspread into all parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nWith respect to trial by jury, Sir William remarks, Vol. III. 130, that\r\nthis waz undoutedly of Saxon institution, and continued thro all the\r\nrevolutions in England. He says there are some traces of it in the first\r\ninstitutions of Odin, the first great leeder of the Asiatic Goths or\r\nGetæ into Europe. He mentions the council of twelv, established by Odin,\r\nand thinks it probable theze twelv men were at first both _judges_ and\r\n_jurors_; that iz, they were a court of arbitrators or referees, az we\r\nshould now style them, empowered to decide all causes according to\r\nequitable principles and the circumstances of each case; and their\r\ndeterminations afterwards grew into precedent for their successors. In\r\nprocess of time and multiplicity of business, the matter of fact\r\ncontinued to be tried by twelv men of the naborhood; but the adjudgement\r\nof punishment and the sentence waz committed to one or two persons of\r\nlerning or knowlege in the ancient customs, records and traditions.\r\nThus, he observes, in the Saxon reigns, causes were adjudged by the\r\naldermen and bishop of the several shires, with the assistance of twelv\r\nmen of the same county, who are said to hav been judges or assistants.\r\nHe allows, the terms _jury_ and _verdict_ were introduced by the\r\nNormans; but asserts very justly that trials by twelv men, with that\r\ncircumstance of their unanimous agreement, were used not only among the\r\nSaxons and Normans, but are known to hav been az ancient in Sweden, az\r\nany records or traditions in the kingdom; and the practice remained in\r\nsome provinces of that country, til the late revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nOn further examination of this subject, I am led to subjoin the\r\nfollowing remarks, which are supported by the indisputable authority of\r\nGlanville and Bracton.\r\n\r\nI hav before suggested that the Saxons, prior to the conquest, conducted\r\nmost of their important affairs in the county or sheriffs court, where\r\nall the free tenants were bound to attend. Theze free tenants consisted\r\nof the lesser barons, the knights and fokemen, or foccage tenants who\r\nhad freehold estates. Theze freeholders, were, by the nature of their\r\nestates, the _pares curtis_; they were the proper and sole _judges_ of\r\nall causes triable at the county court, which included almost all civil\r\nactions, and they were denominated in Saxon, _lahmen_, lawmen. The\r\ncounty court, thus composed of all the freeholders in the shire, waz a\r\ntribunal of great consequence, and inferior only to the witena-gemote,\r\nor national assembly. The Latin riters called theze freemen _pares\r\ncurtis_ and _sectatores_, _peers of court_ and _suitors_. _Curtis_ iz a\r\nSaxon word latinized,[140] like _warrantizo murdrum_, and hundreds of\r\nother law terms; and there iz little dout that _pares_ iz a word of\r\nsimilar origin.\r\n\r\n    [140] _Curtis_, _court_ and the Spanish _Cortez_ are all the\r\n    same word.\r\n\r\nBut what places the point I would establish, beyond controversy, iz, the\r\n_pares curtis_ were in fact of different ranks. The knights or lesser\r\nbarons, az well az the common foccage tenants, were included in the term\r\n_pares curtis_; for they were bound to do suit and service in the court\r\nof the lord paramount. Another fact, iz of equal weight in the argument:\r\nTheze _pares_, in the county court, tried all real actions between the\r\nnobility. In the cause of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and archbishop\r\nLanfranc, in the reign of William the conqueror, the king directed\r\n_totum Comitatum considere_. Many similar instances might be cited, were\r\nit necessary. Theze noblemen were tried by the _pares curtis_, the peers\r\nof the county court; but who ever said they were tried by their\r\n_equals_?\r\n\r\nThe Norman princes attempted to discountenance theze shire motes of the\r\nSaxons, and substitute the trial of facts by twelv _juratores_, men\r\nsworn to speek the truth. In the reign of Henry II, the trial by jurors\r\nhad become common, if not general. Questions of _seisin_ were tried by\r\ntwelv common freeholders; but questions of _right_ were tried by twelv\r\nknights; the sheriff summoning _four_ knights who elected the _twelv_.\r\n\r\nI would here remark that the principal original reezon for summoning\r\nfreeholders _of the vicinage_, waz that of their supposed personal\r\nknowlege of the fact in dispute. The _jurors_ were properly the\r\n_witnesses_. This iz evident from circumstances and from the positiv\r\ntestimony of the erly law-riters. The first mention of a proper jury, in\r\nany public act, iz in the constitutions of Clarendon, 1164, where the\r\nsheriff iz directed, _quòd faciat jurare duodecim legales homines de\r\nvicineto, seu de villa, quòd inde veritatem secundum conscientiam suam\r\nmanifestabunt_. It iz said in old writers that the jury _must speek the\r\ntruth, if they know it_. If the twelv men first summoned knew the truth,\r\nthey were compelled to declare it, under the penalty of perjury. If some\r\nknew the facts and others did not, the latter were dismissed and others\r\nsummoned, till twelv were found who knew the facts, ether by what they\r\nhad seen and heerd themselves, or from such testimony of their fathers\r\nand others, az gained full credit.\r\n\r\nWithout attending to juries in this light, the laws respecting them\r\nappeer beyond measure absurd and tyrannical. Their being _sworn to speek\r\nthe truth_, would be absurd on any other ground; for had they judged of\r\nfacts on _testimony_, they would hav been sworn to declare _their\r\nopinion_, and not the _truth_. Their _verdict, vere dictum_, derives its\r\nname and propriety from the same circumstance; and the present practice\r\nof swearing them to \"a tru verdict giv,\" when they judge of facts only\r\nby the perhaps contradictory testimony of several witnesses, iz,\r\nstrictly speeking, absurd.\r\n\r\nThe keeping juries, without meet, drink or fire, can be accounted for\r\nonly on the same idea; it waz a method to compel an agreement among men,\r\nwho were _acquainted with facts_, some of whom might at times be\r\nobstinate, and not willing to disclose them. But how ridiculous would it\r\nbe to punish men for not agreeing _in opinion_, about what others\r\ntestified!\r\n\r\nAll this iz still more evident from the manner in which many questions\r\nrespecting real estates were ascertained and determined. It waz\r\ncustomary for the jurors, after they were chosen, to go upon the land\r\nto find the tru state of the fact in question, and then deliver their\r\nverdict. Hence the propriety of the expression in closing issues; _and\r\nthis he prays may be enquired of by the country_.\r\n\r\nI would observe further, that the reezon, why appeels from the verdict\r\nof a jury were not allowed, iz simply this, that the jurors were\r\nsupposed to hav decided from their _own knowlege_. It waz certainly a\r\nwise provision that the solemn declaration of men under oath, living in\r\nthe naborhood, and eye or eer witnesses of the recent transactions\r\nbetween the parties, should not be overthrown by other testimony; for\r\nall other evidence must hav necessarily been of an inferior nature. But\r\nthe reezon haz ceesed, and there iz now nothing more sacred in the\r\nverdict of a jury, given on the testimony of others, than there iz in\r\nthe opinions of arbitrators, referees or auditors under oath. The laws\r\nrespecting juries are all founded on the idea that the men were\r\nacquainted with the facts in dispute. Their verdict waz formerly a\r\n_declaration of facts_; it iz now a mere _matter of opinion_. In short,\r\nthe original design of the institution iz totally changed, and mostly\r\nsuperseded. Since juries rely on testimony, they need not be collected\r\nfrom the _vicinage_; it iz even safer to hav men who are strangers to\r\nboth plaintiff and defendant. Jurors cannot be punished for _perjury_,\r\nfor how can a man _perjure_ himself in giving hiz _opinion_? They cannot\r\nbe starved to deth, nor carted about town for disagreement; for how iz\r\nit possible for twelv men always to _think alike_, when they hav to form\r\ntheir opinions on clashing testimonies? In short, juries do not now\r\nanswer one of the purposes for which they were at first instituted; and\r\nhowever necessary they may be deemed to the preservation of civil\r\nliberty, it appeers to me they are, in a great measure, useless.\r\n\r\nI cannot leev this subject without remarking the influence of habit, in\r\nmaintaining _forms_, when the _substance_ no longer exists. This iz\r\nneerly the case with the whole institution of juries; but particularly\r\nin the manner of administering the oath to them. The practice of\r\nswearing the foreman and the other jurors separately, still exists in\r\nsome of theze states, altho the reezon no longer remains. It originated\r\nin the manner of delivering the verdict, which waz, for every juror\r\nseparately to answer the interrogatories of the judge. While this\r\npractice remained, it waz very proper that eech juror should take a\r\nseparate oath; altho this formality iz dispensed with, in administering\r\nthe oath to witnesses, in modern courts; the words, \"_you_ and _eech of\r\nyou_ swear,\" being substituted for a separate administration of the\r\noath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXIV.\r\n\r\n                         HARTFORD, SEPTEMBER, 1789.\r\n\r\n_The_ INJUSTICE, ABSURDITY, _and_ BAD POLICY _of_ LAWS _against_ USURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsury, in the primitiv sense of the word, signifies any compensation\r\ngiven for the use of money; but in modern legal acceptation, it iz the\r\ntaking an exorbitant sum for the use of money; or a sum beyond what iz\r\npermitted by law. The municipal laws of different states and kingdoms\r\nhav fixed different rates of interest; so that what iz usury in one\r\ncountry or state, iz legal interest in another. The propriety of such\r\nlaws iz here called in question.\r\n\r\n1. It iz presumed that such laws are _unjust_. Money iz a species of\r\ncommercial property, in which a man haz az complete ownership, az in any\r\nother chattel interest. He haz therefore the same _natural_ right to\r\nexercise every act of ownership upon money, az upon any other personal\r\nestate; and it iz contended, he ought to hav the same _civil_ and\r\n_political_ right. He ought to hav the same right to trade with money az\r\nwith goods; to sell, to loan and exchange it to any advantage whatever,\r\nprovided there iz no fraud in the business, and the minds of the parties\r\nmeet in the contracts. The legislature haz no right to interfere with\r\nprivate contracts, and say that a man shall make no more than a certain\r\nprofit per cent on the sale of hiz goods, or limit the rent of hiz house\r\nto the annual sum of forty pounds. This position iz admitted for self\r\nevident, az it respects every thing but money; and it must extend to\r\nmoney also, unless it can be proved that the privilege of using money in\r\ntrade or otherwise without restraint, and making what profit a man iz\r\nable by fair contract, with gold and silver, az well az with houses and\r\nlands, will produce some great public inconvenience, which will warrant\r\nthe state in laying the use of such gold and silver under certain\r\nrestrictions.[141]\r\n\r\n    [141] In a conversation I had at Dr. Franklin's on this\r\n    subject, the doctor admitted the principle, and remarked,\r\n    that a man who haz 1000l. in cash, can loan it for six per\r\n    cent. profit only; but he may bild a house with it, and if\r\n    the demand for houses iz sufficient, he may rent hiz house\r\n    for fifteen per cent. on the value. This iz a fair state of\r\n    the argument, and I challenge my antagonists to giv a good\r\n    reezon for the distinction which the laws make in the two\r\n    cases; or why a man should hav an unrestrained right to take\r\n    any sum he can get for the use of hiz house, and yet hiz\r\n    right to make profit by the loan of money, be abridged by\r\n    law.\r\n\r\nThe only reezon commonly given for limiting the interest of money by\r\nlaw, iz, that monied men will otherwise take advantage of the distresses\r\nof the poor and needy, to extort from them exorbitant interest. Admit\r\nthe proposition in its utmost latitude, and it furnishes no argument in\r\nfavor of the restraint, _because the restraint iz no remedy for the\r\nevil_. On the other hand, it generally increases the evil; for when the\r\nlaw forbids a man to take more than six per cent. for the use of hiz\r\nmoney, it, at the same time, leevs him the right of withholding hiz\r\nmoney from hiz distressed nabor, and actually lays before him the\r\nstrongest motivs for withholding it. The law tuches the pride of a man,\r\nby restraining what he deems an unalienable right, and this\r\nconsideration, added to a certainty of employing hiz money to greater\r\nadvantage, impels the man to turn a deef eer to hiz nabors calamities,\r\nwhen he would be otherwise disposed to afford relief. The law therefore,\r\nso far from furnishing a remedy, actually doubles the evil.\r\n\r\nTo proov this assertion more cleerly, let me call the attention of my\r\nreeders to facts within their knowlege. Every man knows that there are\r\npersons in every state, who, thro imprudence, idleness or misfortune,\r\nbecome involved, and unable to pay their dets when du. Theze persons\r\nseldom make provision for discharging their dets, till they are pressed\r\nby their creditors. When they are urged by just demands or legal\r\nprocess, they are under a necessity of raising money immediately: But\r\nmoney iz scarce; it iz in a few men's hands, who will not pay the full\r\nvalu of lands or personal estate. The poor detor iz then obliged to sell\r\nhiz farm or hiz cattle, or both, at private sale or at auction, for any\r\nprice they will fetch, which iz commonly but a small part of the valu.\r\nNow, if the detor could hav borrowed a sum of money, at ten, fifteen, or\r\neven twenty per cent. he might hav been a gainer by the loan; for by\r\nbeing prohibited by law from borrowing money, at a high interest, he haz\r\nbeen obliged to sacrifice twenty, perhaps fifty or a hundred per cent.\r\nLaws against usury do not help such men; on the contrary they oppress\r\nthem. Could such men get money even at twenty per cent. they would often\r\nbe benefited by the loan; they might save their estates and avoid misery\r\nand ruin. A prohibition of high interest only compels the distressed to\r\nseek releef by sacrificing property in a way not guarded against by law.\r\nNay, I beg leev to assert that such laws are the very meens of\r\nproducing, supporting and enriching a host of oppressors in every state\r\nin America. There are a few men, in every state, who are what iz called\r\n_beforehand_; theze men will not loan money at legal interest, for this\r\nvery good reezon, they _can do better with it_, az they say; and no man\r\ncan blame another for making the most profitable use of hiz money. Theze\r\nmen therefore keep their money, till their distressed nabor iz forced by\r\ndet to sell hiz farm; then iz the time to lay out their money; they get\r\nthe farm at their own price, which iz generally less than half its valu.\r\nIn most states, lands are sold at auction, where they are sacrificed;\r\nand the poor owner haz all the charges of a legal suit to pay, az wel az\r\nthe det; and the land sold for a small part of its valu. This iz the\r\ncommon practice, authorized by law; so that laws against usury only\r\n_create_ an evil in one way, by endevoring to _prevent it_ in another.\r\n\r\nThe evil and hardships of this law, of selling real estate on execution,\r\nhav been so great, az to giv rise to a different mode of satisfying\r\nexecutions in Connecticut. In this state, a man's person and estate are\r\nboth liable for det; but if the personal estate iz insufficient, the\r\ncreditor haz hiz election, ether to confine the dettor in prison, or\r\ntake hiz lands. But the law, which iz so far in favor of the creditor,\r\nhere steps in to prevent a sacrifice of the real property at public\r\nsale; and ordains that the creditor shall take it at a value, which\r\nshall be apprized by three indifferent freeholders. This law does\r\ninjustice to the creditor; for it interferes with the contract, and\r\nobliges him to take that for pay which he did not engage to receev. But\r\nit favors the dettor, in a state where money iz scarce and cannot be\r\neezily raized on an emergency. So far one law, by doing injustice to\r\ncreditors, corrects some of the ill effects of the law against high\r\ninterest in Connecticut; but the remedy iz partial, for men in distress\r\nfor money, generally sell their estates at private sale, for one half\r\ntheir valu; and a few monied men and rich farmers are constantly taking\r\nadvantage of their nabors calamities, to enrich themselves. Such men\r\nmake more than fifty per cent. per ann. on their money by theze\r\nspeculations, and no law can wholly prevent them. Now laws against usury\r\ncreate this very evil: They drive money from a country; they create a\r\nnecessity for it; and then a few welthy men enrich themselves, not by\r\nloaning at fifteen or twenty per cent. but by purchasing lands at half\r\nprice, which are sold to keep men from jail, who, if they could hav got\r\nmoney for a few months, at twenty per cent. might hav sold their estates\r\nto advantage, or otherwise paid their dets. In general then we may\r\nobzerv, when a man iz reduced to the necessity of asking money at twenty\r\nper cent., hiz situation iz such that it iz better to giv that interest,\r\nthan to risk a sale of property on a sudden to raize the money. Laws\r\nagainst usury do not save such men; it iz idle to suppose it; on the\r\ncontrary, they multiply instances of oppression, az all America can\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nBut the argument, if good, proovs too much. If legislators hav a right\r\nto fix the profit on money at interest, to prevent exorbitant demands\r\nfrom injuring the necessitous, wil not the same reezon warrant a\r\nrestriction on the profits of every commodity in market? If my rulers\r\nhav a right to say, my annual profit on money loaned, shal be but six\r\nper cent. hav they not a right to say the advance on my wheet shal be\r\nbut six per cent.? Where iz the difference? A poor man may indeed be\r\ndistressed by a demand of high interest, and so he may by the high price\r\nof flour; and I beg leev to say, that distresses from the last cause are\r\ninfinitely the most numerous, and the most deserving of legislativ\r\nremedies. It wil perhaps be said that the price of bred, in all cities,\r\niz fixed by law--tru; but if the price of wheet iz not likewise fixed,\r\nthere are times of scarcity when the law must vary the price, or the\r\nbaker must be ruined, and the poor be destitute of bred. In an extensiv\r\nfertile country, like America, such cases may not happen frequently; but\r\nthe actual existence of the fact proovs that such laws rather _follow_\r\nthe state of the market, than _regulate_ it. And indeed it iz a\r\nquestion, whether in this country, the citizens of our large towns would\r\nnot be supplied with bred at a cheeper rate, without any regulations at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n2. But the _absurdity_ and _bad policy_ of laws against usury, are so\r\nobvious, that it iz surprizing scarcely an attempt haz been made to\r\nabolish them in any country. Such laws are absurd and impolitic, because\r\nthey actually and always produce and multiply the distresses they are\r\ndesigned to remedy. It iz impossible it should be otherwise: The very\r\nlaws of nature and commerce require that such restraints should\r\nnecessarily counteract their own design. It iz necessary that\r\ncommodities should be sometimes plenty and sometimes scarce; and it iz\r\nequally necessary that money, the representativ of all commodities,\r\nshould be liable to the same fluctuations. In the commercial world,\r\nmoney and commodities wil always flow to that country, where they are\r\nmost wanted and wil command the most profit. The consequence iz that a\r\nhigh price soon produces a low price, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nLet us apply the principle to the present question. When money can bear\r\nits own profit, its profit or the interest arising on loans, wil be in\r\nproportion to the profit made in commercial transactions. If a man can\r\nmake _twelv per cent._ on hiz stock, in any kind of trade or\r\nspeculation, he wil not convert that stock into cash, and loan it at\r\n_six per cent._ While therefore commerce or speculation wil afford a man\r\ngreater profits, than the law affords him on hiz loans of cash, he wil\r\nhav no money to lend. The consequence iz, while the law fixes the rate\r\nof interest lower than the annual profits of other business, a country\r\nwil be destitute of money.\r\n\r\nThis iz precisely the case in America. Our remittances to Europe and the\r\nEast Indies require considerable sums in specie to be exported; and the\r\nmerchant wil not import specie, except to facilitate the purchase of hiz\r\ncargoes in America. He will not import it for the purpose of loaning,\r\nbecause hiz stock in trade affords a better profit. The few landholders\r\nwho hav a little cash abuv their annual expenditures, wil not loan it;\r\nfor they can make twelv, fifteen, eighteen per cent. on their money by\r\nthe purchase of certificates, and more on the purchase of lands. There\r\nare therefore no motivs, no inducements, for the welthy citizens to loan\r\nmoney, and consequently when a man iz distressed to make a payment, he\r\niz compelled to sacrifice property to perhaps five times the valu of the\r\ndet; because the law will not permit hiz nabor to take twelv or fifteen\r\nper cent. per ann. for the loan of money, a few months; when he haz the\r\nmoney, and would gladly releev hiz frend, if he could receev an adequate\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nThus laws against usury drive cash from a country. They really and\r\ncontinually create a scarcity of an article, and then restrain men from\r\nraizing the price, in proportion to that scarcity. They create\r\ndistresses of the poor, and at the same time, create an impossibility of\r\nreleef. Were money left, like all kinds of commodities, to command its\r\nown price in market; whenever its price should rize abuv the usual cleer\r\nprofit of other business, men would import specie, or turn their stock\r\ninto cash, and loan it on good security; for no man would submit to the\r\ndrudgery of business, if he could make money az fast by lying stil, with\r\nhiz money at interest. Had money been permitted to bear its own price\r\naccording to the demand for it in America since the war, it would hav\r\nbeen kept in the country, or introduced til the rate of interest had\r\nfallen, even below the legal standard. Limit the profit on any article\r\nof life, and set the price so low that peeple can make more by deeling\r\nin other articles, and the articles so fixed wil become scarce and deer.\r\nWere the legislatures of the several states to say that our traders\r\nshould make but one per cent. on salt, they would not bring cargoes of\r\nit to the country. It would be az scarce az money iz now. Let the price\r\nof wheet be fixed at half a dollar a bushel, and in two years we should\r\nnot hav a bushel in market. It iz the same case with money. The low\r\nprofits on the use of money, expel it from the country, and none can be\r\nobtained at the legal price. Let the interest rize to any sum which can\r\nbe obtained, and in two years, it would be az eezy to borrow money at a\r\nlow interest, az it iz now difficult to command it at any price. The\r\nlaws of nature wil continue to opperate, in spite of the feeble\r\nopposition of human power.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration demands our notice. The laws against usury\r\nincrease the distresses of the needy, by enhancing the risk, and\r\nconsequently the insurance on loans.[142] It iz fruitless to attempt to\r\nprevent loans of money. When men are pressed for money, they can always\r\nfind persons to supply them, upon _some_ terms. But az a loan of money\r\nat a higher rate of interest than iz allowed by law, exposes the lender\r\nto a loss of the money, and a fine or forfiture besides, hiz demand for\r\nthe use of hiz money wil rize in proportion to that risk. This haz\r\nalways been one of the most pernicious effects of such laws. So that the\r\nlaw, not only creates a scarcity in the first instance, but actually\r\nraizes the demand of interest much abuv the natural demand required by\r\nthat scarcity. In short, insted of releeving the detter, it multiplies\r\nhiz distresses four fold.\r\n\r\n    [142] See Blackstone on this subject, Com. Vol. II. 455,\r\n    where the author's reezoning holds good, whether against\r\n    fixing the value of horse hire or money lent. All exorbitant\r\n    demands are unjust _in foro conscientiæ_; but what right haz\r\n    a legislature to fix the price of money loaned, and not of\r\n    house-rent?\r\n\r\nBesides, such laws, like all national restrictions on trade, tend to\r\nmake men dishonest, in particular things, and thus weeken the powers of\r\nthe moral faculty. There are ten thousand ways of evading such laws, and\r\nslight evasions gradually produce a habit of violating law, and harden\r\nthe mind against the feer of its penalties. Indeed, such laws tend to\r\nundermine that confidence which iz the basis of social intercourse. Laws\r\nwhich encourage _informations_, should be enacted with caution. Such are\r\nlaws against usury. A man haz often the strongest temptation to be a\r\ntreecherous rascal, by inducing hiz frend to loan him money, on illegal\r\ninterest, and then betraying him. This species of villany waz lately\r\ncarried so far in Massachusetts, az to induce the legislature to repeel\r\na clauze of their law against usury. And a man of morality must shudder,\r\nwhile he reeds the legal prosecutions and adjudications in England upon\r\ntheir statutes of usury.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of attempting to _fix the valu of money_ iz another\r\nobjection to it of no small consequence. The valu of it depends wholly\r\non the quantity in circulation and the demand. In this respect it\r\nresembles all other articles of trade; and who ever thought of fixing\r\nthe price of goods by law?[143] It iz almost impossible for a\r\nlegislature to ascertain exactly the valu of money at any one time; and\r\nutterly impossible to say that the valu when ascertained, shall continu\r\nthe same for six months. Nay, two slates adjoining eech other may\r\nestimate the use of money very differently at the same period. In New\r\nYork the legal interest iz seven per cent. in New England but six. A man\r\nmay therefore do that legally in one state, which in the others would\r\nexpoze him to a severe penalty.\r\n\r\n    [143] The legislatures of several states during the late war,\r\n    were rash enough to make the attempt; and the success of the\r\n    scheme waz just equal to the wisdom that planned it.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Rome, the interest waz twelv per cent. The emperor Justinian\r\nreduced it to four, but allowed higher interest to be taken of\r\nmerchants, on account of the risk. In Holland, when Grotius wrote, the\r\ncommon interest waz eight per cent.; but twelv to merchants. In England,\r\nthe statute 37th, Henry VIII, confined interest to _ten_ per cent. By\r\nthe 21st James I, it waz reduced to eight; by the 12th Charles II, to\r\nsix; and by 12th Ann, to five, the present legal interest in that\r\ncountry.[144]\r\n\r\n    [144] Blackstone Vol. II. 462.\r\n\r\nPostlethwaite remarks very justly that theze laws hav not ascertained\r\nthe real valu or interest of money; for when the legal interest haz been\r\nsix per cent. the real interest haz sometimes been four; and when the\r\nlegal interest haz been five, the real interest haz sometimes been\r\nseven. Indeed the interest of money depends on such a combination of\r\ncircumstances, az the scarcity of money, the demand in market, and the\r\nhazard, that an attempt to find and fix a permanent rate, iz one of the\r\nmost visionary schemes that a public body can undertake. To proov the\r\nimpossibility of such a scheme, I would only mention the continual\r\npractice of violating laws against usury; which would not be the case,\r\nif the real valu of money had been ascertained and fixed.[145] If\r\nlegislatures had found the tru valu of the use of money, there would hav\r\nbeen fewer violations of their laws: If they hav, in any case, fixed a\r\nrate of interest lower than the real valu, they hav violated the rights\r\nof their subjects. This iz a serious consideration; and perhaps in no\r\ninstance are the laws of England and America more strongly marked with\r\nthe traces of ancient prejudice and barbarity, than in the prohibition\r\nwhich prevents a man from using hiz _money_ az he pleezes, while he may\r\ndemand any sum whatever for the use of hiz other property.\r\n\r\n    [145] What are marine insurances, bottomry, loans at\r\n    respondentia and annuities for life, but exceptions to the\r\n    general law against usury? The necessity of higher interest\r\n    than common iz pleeded for theze exceptions. Very good; but\r\n    they proov the absurdity of attempting to fix that, which the\r\n    laws of nature and commerce require should be fluctuating.\r\n    Such laws are partial and iniquitous.\r\n\r\nThe only power, I conceev, a legislature haz to determin what interest\r\nshall arize on the use of money, or property, iz where the parties hav\r\nnot determined it by agreement. Thus when a man haz taken up goods upon\r\ncredit, or where, by any other legal meens, a man becomes possessed of\r\nanothers money or estate, without a specific stipulation for interest,\r\nthe law very properly steps in and ascertains the sum which the detter\r\nshall pay for the use of that money. But to make a law that a man shall\r\nnot take but six per cent. for the use of money, when the borrower iz\r\nwilling to giv more, and the lender cannot part with hiz money at that\r\nrate of interest, iz a daring violation of private rights, an injury\r\noften to both parties, and productiv of innumerable embarrassments to\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nWe are told that such laws are necessary to guard men from the\r\noppression of the rich. What an error! Waz a monied man ever compelled\r\nto assist a distressed nabor, by the forfitures incurred by such laws?\r\nIz not hiz money hiz own? Wil he lend it all, if it should not be for\r\nhiz benefit? Besides, cannot a man in necessity alienate hiz property\r\nfor one fourth of its valu? Are not such bona fide contracts made every\r\nday to raize money to answer a temporary purpose? Nay, hav not the laws\r\nof all commercial states authorized _sales by auction_, where any man\r\nmay part with hiz property for a fourth of its valu? Iz there any remedy\r\nin law against such a sacrifice of a man's estate? Wherein then consists\r\nthe security of laws against usury? In the name of common sense and\r\ncommon equity, let legislators be consistent. If men are improvident,\r\nlazy and careless, a loss of property wil be their punishment, and no\r\nmezures of government wil prevent it.\r\n\r\nTo what then shall we ascribe the severe laws against high interest,\r\nwhich hav been and stil are existing in most commercial countries? I\r\npresume the cause may be easily assigned. The Jewish prohibition, not\r\nto take interest, except of strangers, first gave rise to douts in the\r\nminds of our pious christian forefathers, with respect to the legality\r\nof any interest at all. This produced, in the dark ages, severe\r\necclesiastical laws against taking any thing for the use of money; and\r\ntheze laws originated a general prejudice against it, thro the Christian\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, commerce began to revive; but\r\naz there waz but little money, and trade waz lucrativ, because in few\r\nhands, money bore a very high interest. In some parts of Europe, the\r\ninterest waz forty per cent. Even with this interest, certain Italian\r\ntraders could make an annual profit, and therefore it waz for their\r\nbenefit to giv it. It however rendered them very unpopular.[146]\r\n\r\n    [146] Robertsons Charles V. Vol. I. 280.\r\n\r\nThe Jews, for their infidelity, had been considered by the Christians az\r\noutcasts on earth. Severe laws were enacted against them in almost every\r\ncountry; depriving them of the rights of citizens, and forbidding them\r\nto hold real estates. Proscribed and insulted, the poor Jews were\r\ncompelled to turn their _hand against every man_ in their own defence.\r\nThey commenced strolling traders and bankers, and by theze meens\r\ncommanded a large share of the money in every kingdom.\r\n\r\nWith this command of cash, the Jews very justly compensated themselves\r\nfor the injuries they suffered from the tyrannical laws which existed\r\nagainst them. They loaned money at the highest rate of interest they\r\ncould obtain. Hence the general karacter of the Jews, and the prejudice\r\nagainst them that survives to this enlightened period.\r\n\r\nIt iz very probable, that before the discovery of the American mines,\r\nmoney waz so scarce in Europe, that a few brokers in eech kingdom might\r\nengross such a share, az to hav it in their power to oppress peeple.\r\nThis waz evidently the case in England, about the reign of Edward I, and\r\nthe parliament thought proper to interfere and restrain the evil. Laws\r\nagainst usury were doutless necessary and useful at that time. But\r\nsince the world haz been filled with gold and silver from South America,\r\nand nations hav opened an intercourse with eech other, there never can\r\nbe a want of specie, where a country can supply produce enough to\r\nexchange for it. It haz become a mere fluid in the commercial world; and\r\nin order to obtain a supply, in a country abounding with produce and\r\nmanufactures, the legislature haz nothing to do, but let it bear its own\r\nprice; let it command its own valu, ether at interest, or in exchange\r\nfor commodities.\r\n\r\nLaws against usury therefore I consider az originating ether in the\r\nnecessity of the times, which long ago ceesed, or in a bigotted\r\nprejudice against the Jews, which waz az barbarous formerly, az it iz\r\nnow infamous. Laws restraining the interest of money I now consider, in\r\nthe same light, az I do laws against freedom of conscience. And were it\r\nnot for the force of habit, I should az soon expect to see a modern\r\nlegislature ordering a pious sectary to the stake for hiz principles, az\r\nto see them gravely passing a law, to limit the profit on the use of hiz\r\nmoney. And unless the legislatures of this enlightened age should repeel\r\nsuch laws, and place money on a footing with other property, they will\r\nbe considered az accessory to a direct violation of the deerest rights\r\nof men, and will be answerable for more frauds, perjuries, treechery and\r\nexpensiv litigations, than proceed from any other single cause in\r\nsociety. I am so firmly persuaded of the truth of theze principles, that\r\nI venture to predict, the opinions of men will be changed in less than\r\nhalf a century, and posterity will wonder that their forefathers could\r\nthink of maintaining a position so absurd and contradictory, az that men\r\nhav no right to make more than six per cent. on the _loan of money_,\r\nwhile they hav an indefeezable right to make unlimited profit on their\r\nmoney in any other manner. They will vew laws against usury in the same\r\nlight that we do the inquisition in Spain, the execution of gypsies and\r\nwitches in the last century, or thoze laws of England which make 100l.\r\nannual income necessary to qualify a man for killing a partridge, while\r\nthey allow _forty shillings_ only to qualify him for electing a knight\r\nof the shire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. XXV.\r\n\r\n                         HARTFORD, OCTOBER, 1789.\r\n\r\n_On_ ALLEGIANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWriters on law divide allegiance into two kinds, _natural_ and _local_.\r\n\"Natural allegiance iz such az iz du from all men born within the kings\r\ndominions, immediately upon their berth. For immediately upon their\r\nberth, they are under the kings protection; at a time too when (during\r\ntheir infancy) they are incapable of protecting themselves. Natural\r\nallegiance iz therefore a det of gratitude, which cannot be forfeited,\r\ncancelled or altered, by any change of time, place or circumstances; nor\r\nby any thing but the united concurrence of the legislature. An\r\nEnglishman who remoovs to France or to China, owes the same allegiance\r\nto the king of England there az at home, and twenty years hence az wel\r\naz now. For it iz a principle of universal law, that the natural born\r\nsubject of one prince cannot by any act of hiz own, no, not by swearing\r\nallegiance to another, put off or discharge hiz natural allegiance to\r\nthe former; for hiz natural allegiance waz intrinsic and primitiv and\r\nantecedent to the other, and cannot be devested, without the concurrent\r\nact of that prince to whom it waz first du. Indeed the natural born\r\nsubject of one prince, to whom he owes allegiance, may be entangled by\r\nsubjecting himself absolutely to another; but it iz hiz own act that\r\nbrings him into theze straits and difficulties, of owing service to two\r\nmasters; and it iz unreezonable that, by such voluntary act of hiz own,\r\nhe should be able at plezure to unloose thoze bands by which he iz\r\nconnected to hiz natural prince.\"[147]\r\n\r\n    [147] Blackstone Com. Vol. I. 369.\r\n\r\nI mistake much, however, if the natural born subject would be so much\r\n_entangled with hiz straits and difficulties_, az lord Coke, Hale and\r\nBlackstone, would be, to support their assertions and obviate the\r\nabsurdities of their reezoning.\r\n\r\nIt iz astonishing to observe how slowly men get rid of old prejudices\r\nand opinions. The feudal ideas of allegiance, which make _fidelity in\r\nthe subject an obligation or grateful return for the protection of the\r\nprince_, stil prevail, and are made the basis of all modern reezoning on\r\nthe subject. Such ideas in the dark ages, and in the days of feudal\r\ndespotism, are not to be wondered at. Every baron waz a tyrant on hiz\r\nmanor, and az hiz only safety consisted in hiz castle and hiz vassals,\r\nit waz necessary to bind hiz subjects to him by oaths and superstition,\r\naz wel az by a demand upon their gratitude. But wil our sage writers on\r\ngovernment and law, forever think by tradition? Wil they never examin\r\nthe grounds of receeved opinions? Let me enquire.\r\n\r\nWhat iz the real ground of _allegiance_? Iz it not _protection_? Not at\r\nall. We may just az wel invert the proposition, and say, that\r\n_allegiance_ iz the ground of _protection_. A prince iz the\r\nrepresentativ of a nation or state, so that allegiance to him, iz merely\r\nallegiance to a state or body politic.[148] According to our ideas,\r\nallegiance to a king, and fidelity to a state, are the same thing; for\r\ndetach a king from all connection with a nation or state, and he becumes\r\na private man, and entitled only to the rights of such. This at leest iz\r\nthe opinion of an _American_, whose mind iz not biassed by personal\r\nattachments to a sovereign.\r\n\r\n    [148] Blackstone remarks that allegiance iz applicable, not\r\n    only to the political capacity of the king, or regal office,\r\n    but to hiz _natural person_ and _blood royal_. I would ask\r\n    then what _blood royal_ there can be in a man, except in hiz\r\n    _kingly capacity_?\r\n\r\nWhat then iz the ground of fidelity to a state? The answer iz eezy; the\r\n_moral law_, which haz for its object the _good of society_. This iz the\r\nbasis of all obligations in a state, whether express or implied; yet\r\nwriters on this subject hav hardly mentioned it. Blackstone indeed takes\r\nnotice of an implied, original allegiance, antecedent to any express\r\npromis; but seems rather to consider it az a return for the duties of\r\nthe sovereign, which he owes before coronation, than az an obligation\r\narising from the very constitution of society.\r\n\r\nTaking the moral law or the good of society for the ground of all\r\nallegiance, we discuver two species of duties to be performed by every\r\nman; the _moral duties_, which exist at all times and in all places; and\r\ncertain _political duties_, required by the municipal laws of eech\r\nstate. The first are the basis of natural or perpetual allegiance; the\r\nlast, of local allegiance. The first or moral duties create an\r\nobligation upon every man, the moment he iz born, which cannot be\r\ncancelled or discharged by any act of an individual, or by any agreement\r\nbetween prince and subject; the last, or political duties, impoze an\r\nobligation upon every member of a state or body politic, the moment he\r\nsteps within its jurisdiction, to submit peaceably to such positiv\r\ninjunctions of that state, az hav been judged necessary for its welfare.\r\n\r\nNow to maintain that an oath of allegiance wil bind a man to perform all\r\nthe last class of duties, or the positiv duties enjoined by a particular\r\nstate, and not required by the general laws of society, when the man haz\r\nperhaps become a member of another state, three thousand miles distant,\r\niz to defend the wildest notions that can possess any man's brain. Every\r\nman iz bound always and in all places to _do right, and avoid doing\r\nrong_; and this with, or without taking an oath of fidelity to any\r\nstate. This iz implied allegiance, universal and perpetual; and I deny\r\nthat there iz any other ground of this allegiance, except the universal\r\nprinciples of right and rong.\r\n\r\nShould it be said, that a man may bind himself _by oath_ to perform the\r\npositiv or political duties required by a state, altho he may remoov and\r\nbecome a citizen of another state; I answer, this wil involv him in the\r\n_straits_ and _difficulties_ mentioned by Blackstone; for the political\r\nduties of the two states may interfere with eech other. The truth iz, a\r\nman haz no right to take such an oath, nor haz a state any right to\r\nrequire it. He may swear, when he enters into any kingdom or state,\r\nthat he wil be a good citizen, and submit to all the laws of the state,\r\n_while he iz a member of it_; and further, that he wil observe the moral\r\nlaw in hiz conduct towards that society, after _he haz ceesed to be a\r\nmember of it_. Further than this, he haz no right to swear. Az to every\r\nduty, not required by the laws of society in general, but only by the\r\nmunicipal laws of a state, a man's allegiance commences when he enters\r\nthat state; and ceeses the moment he leeves it.[149] The doctrin of a\r\nperpetual allegiance iz wholly a feudal idea; inculcated, when every\r\nlord waz at war with hiz nabor; and waz compelled by self preservation\r\nto attach hiz vassals to himself by oaths, the penalties of perjury and\r\nthe forfeitures of treezon.\r\n\r\n    [149] Except the case of Ambassadors or other agents.\r\n\r\nBlackstone says, in the passage already quoted, \"that natural allegiance\r\niz a det of gratitude,\" because the subject iz under the kings\r\nprotection while an infant. He might just az wel say, _protection iz a\r\ndet of gratitude_ du from the prince, because the subject iz born in hiz\r\ndominions. On this principle of gratitude, a child iz obliged to obey\r\nand serve hiz parent, after he haz left hiz family, and while he livs.\r\nThis det, according to the same author, cannot be cancelled, but _by\r\n\"concurrence of the legislature.\"_ How in the name of reezon, can an act\r\nof the legislature dissolv a _natural tie_? How can it _cancel a det of\r\ngratitude_? Common sense looks with disdain on such week and futile\r\nreezoning. But if there iz such a thing az natural and perpetual\r\nallegiance, an Englishman, who remoovs to France, cannot take arms to\r\ndefend France against an invasion from England. Is this agreeable to the\r\nlaws of nature and society, that a man should not protect himself and\r\nhiz property? It wil be said that the man iz within the English king's\r\nliegeance, and entitled to hiz protection. But the king cannot protect\r\nhim; it iz beyond hiz power, and the Englishman iz not obliged to leev\r\nFrance and seek protection in England. Hiz estate and hiz family may be\r\nin France, and if he chooses to reside there, it iz hiz unalienable\r\nright and duty to defend both against any invasion whatever. Every war,\r\nexcept a defensiv one, iz a breech of the moral law; but when a natural\r\nborn subject of England, haz become a citizen of France, he iz subject\r\nto the laws of France, and bound to assist, if required, in defending\r\nthe kingdom against hiz natural prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXVI.\r\n\r\n                         HARTFORD, JULY, 1789.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION _of the_ REEZONS, _why_ MARRIAGE _iz_ PROHIBITED _between_\r\nNATURAL RELATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch haz been said and written to ascertain between what relations\r\nmarriage ought to be permitted. The civil, the canon, and the English\r\nlaws, differ az to the degrees of consanguinity necessary to render this\r\nconnection improper. A detail of the arguments on this subject, and even\r\na recapitulation of the decrees of ecclesiastical councils, in the erly\r\nages of the church, would be tedious and uninteresting. I shall only\r\noffer a few thoughts of my own on the question, with a view to\r\nillustrate a single point, which haz been agitated in modern times, and\r\non which the different American states hav passed different decisions.\r\nThe point iz, whether a man should be permitted to marry hiz former\r\nwife's sister. In some states this iz permitted; in others, prohibited.\r\n\r\nThoze who favor the prohibition, ground their reezon on the Levitical\r\nlaw, which says a man shall not marry hiz wife's sister, during the life\r\nof hiz wife, to vex her. This prohibition, while it restrains a man from\r\nhaving two sisters for wives at the same time, among a peeple where\r\npoligamy waz permitted, iz a negativ pregnant, and a strong argument\r\nthat a man waz allowed, after the deth of a wife, to marry her sister.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish law, however divine, waz designed for a particular nation,\r\nand iz no farther binding upon other nations, than it respects the\r\nnatural and social duties. In no one particular, hav men been more\r\nmistaken, than in explaining divine commands. It haz been sufficient for\r\nthem to reseiv a law into the wil of God, without examining into the\r\nreezons for which the law waz revealed. They seem to hav inverted the\r\nfoundation of moral obligation, in supposing the moral law to derive its\r\npropriety and fitness originally from the wil of Deity, rather than from\r\nthe nature of things. They talk about the fitness and unfitness of\r\nthings, independent, not only of society, but of God himself. Such wild\r\nnotions, I presume, are not common. There could be no fitness nor\r\nunfitness of things, before things were made; nor could right and rong\r\nexist without social beings. The moral duties therefore are not right,\r\nmerely because they are commanded by God; but they are commanded by him,\r\nbecause they are right. The propriety or fitness of them depends on the\r\nvery nature of society; and this fitness, which waz coeval with\r\ncreation, waz the ground of the divine command.[150]\r\n\r\n    [150] It may be said, that _moral right_ and _rong_ must\r\n    ultimately be resolved into the wil of Deity, because society\r\n    itself depends on hiz wil. This iz conceded; I only contend\r\n    that moral fitness and unfitness result _immediately_ from\r\n    the state of created beings, with relation to eech other, and\r\n    not from any arbitrary rules imposed by Deity, subsequent to\r\n    creation.\r\n\r\nThe law of Moses, regulating marriages, waz founded on this propriety or\r\nfitness of things. A divine command givs a sanction to the law; but the\r\npropriety of it existed prior to the command. The reezons for\r\nprohibiting marriage between certain relations are important; yet they\r\nseem not to be understood. It haz been sufficient, in discussing this\r\npoint, to say, _such iz the law of God_; and few attempts hav been made\r\nto find the reezons of it, by which alone its extent and authority can\r\nbe ascertained.\r\n\r\nThere are two rules, furnished by the laws of nature, for regulating\r\nmatrimonial connections. The first iz, that marriage, which iz a social\r\nand civil connection, should not interfere with a natural relation, so\r\naz to defeet or destroy its duties and rights. Thus it iz highly\r\nimproper that an aunt should marry her nephew, or a grandfather hiz\r\ngrand daughter; because the duties and rights of the natural relation,\r\nwould be superseded by the positiv duties and rights of the civil\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nThe other rule iz much more important. It iz a law of nature that\r\nvegetables should degenerate, if planted continually on the same soil.\r\nHence the change of seeds among farmers. Animals degenerate on the same\r\nprinciple. The physical causes of this law of nature, are perhaps among\r\nthe arcana of creation; but the effects are obvious; and it iz\r\nsurprizing that modern writers on law and ethics should pass over almost\r\nthe only reezons of prohibiting marriage between blood relations.\r\nConsanguinity, and not affinity, iz the ground of the prohibition.[151]\r\n\r\n    [151] By the ancient laws of England, relations in the same\r\n    degree, whether by consanguinity or affinity, were placed\r\n    exactly on a footing. See the suttle reezoning by which the\r\n    prohibitions were supported, in Reeve's History of the\r\n    English Laws, Vol. IV.\r\n\r\nIt iz no crime for brothers and sisters to intermarry, except the fatal\r\nconsequences to society; for were it generally practised, men would soon\r\nbecome a race of pigmies. It iz no crime for brothers and sisters\r\nchildren to intermarry, and this iz often practised; but such near blood\r\nconnections often produce imperfect children. The common peeple hav\r\nhence drawn an argument to proov such connections criminal; considering\r\nweakness, sickness and deformity in the offspring az judgements upon the\r\nparents. Superstition iz often awake, when reezon iz asleep. It iz just\r\naz criminal for a man to marry hiz cousin, az it iz to sow flax every\r\nyear on the same ground; but when he does this, he must not complain, if\r\nhe haz an indifferent crop.\r\n\r\nHere then the question occurs, iz it proper for a man to marry hiz\r\nwife's sister? The answer iz plain. The practice does not interfere with\r\nany law of nature or society; and there iz not the smallest impropriety\r\nin a man's marrying ten sisters of hiz wife in succession. There iz no\r\nnatural relation destroyed; there iz no relation by blood; and _cessante\r\nratione, cessat et ipsa Lex_; the law ceeses when the reezon of it\r\nceeses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXVII.\r\n\r\n                         HARTFORD, FEBRUARY, 1790.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS REMARKS _on_ DIVIZIONS _of_ PROPERTY, GUVERNMENT,\r\nEDUCATION, RELIGION, AGRICULTURE, SLAVERY, COMMERCE, CLIMATE _and_\r\nDISEEZES _in the_ UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laws which respect property, hav, in all civilized communities,\r\nformed the most important branch of municipal regulations. Of theze, the\r\nlaws which direct the division and desent of lands, constitute the first\r\nclass; for on theze, in a great mezure, depend the genius of guvernment\r\nand the complection of manners.\r\n\r\nSavages hav very few regulations respecting property; for there are but\r\nfew things to which their desires or necessities prompt them to lay\r\nclaim. Some very rude nations seem to hav no ideas of property,\r\nespecially in lands; but the American tribes, even when first\r\ndiscuvered, claimed the lands on which they lived, and the hunting\r\ngrounds of eech tribe were marked from thoze of its nabors, by rivers or\r\nother natural boundaries. The Mexican and Peruvian Indians had indeed\r\nadvanced very far towards a state of civilization; and land with them\r\nhad acquired almost an European valu; but the northern tribes, yet in\r\nthe hunter state, would often barter millions of akers for a handful of\r\ntrinkets and a few strings of wampum.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of nations, land acquires a valu, proportioned to the\r\ndegree of populousness; and other objects grow into estimation, by their\r\nutility, convenience, or some plezure they afford to the imagination.\r\n\r\nIn attending to the principles of guvernment, the leeding idea that\r\nstrikes the mind, iz, that political power depends mostly on property;\r\nconsequently guvernment will take its complection from the divisions of\r\nproperty in the state.\r\n\r\nIn despotic states, the subjects must not possess property in fee; for\r\nan exclusiv possession of lands inspires ideas of independence, fatal to\r\ndespotism. To support such guvernments, it iz necessary that the laws\r\nshould giv the prince a sovereign control over the property az wel az\r\nthe lives of hiz subjects. There are however very few countries, where\r\nthe guvernment iz so purely arbitrary, that the peeple can be deprived\r\nof life and estate, without some legal formalities. Even when the first\r\npossession waz the voluntary gift of the prince, grants or concessions,\r\nsanctioned by prescription, hav often established rights in the subject,\r\nof which he cannot be deprived without a judicial process.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the feudal system of tenures haz given rise to a singular\r\nspecies of guvernment. Most of the countries are said to be guverned by\r\n_monarkies_; but many of the guvernments might, with propriety, be\r\ncalled _aristocratic republics_. The barons, who possess, the lands, hav\r\nmost of the power in their own hands. Formerly the kings were but lords\r\nof a superior rank, _primi inter pares_; and they were originally\r\nelectiv. This iz stil the case in Poland, which continues to be what\r\nother states in Europe were, an _aristocratic republic_. But from the\r\ntwelfth to the sixteenth century, the princes, in many countries, were\r\nstruggling to circumscribe the power of the barons, and their attempts,\r\nwhich often desolated their dominions, were attended with various\r\nsuccess. What they could not accomplish by force, they sometimes\r\nobtained by stratagem. In some countries the commons were called in to\r\nsupport the royal prerogativs, and thus obtained a share in legislation,\r\nwhich haz since been augmented by vast accessions of power and\r\ninfluence, from a distribution and encreese of welth. This haz been the\r\ncase in England. In other countries, the prince haz combined with the\r\nbarons to depress the peeple. Where the prince holds the privilege of\r\ndisposing of civil, military and ecclesiastical offices, it haz been\r\neezy to attach the nobility to hiz interest, and by this coalition,\r\npeece haz often been secured in a kingdom; but the peeple hav been kept\r\nin vassalage. Thus by the laws of the feudal system, most of the commons\r\nin Europe are kept in a state of dependence on the great landholders.\r\n\r\nBut commerce haz been favorable to mankind. Az the rules of succession\r\nto estates, every where established in Europe, are calculated to\r\naggrandize the _few_ at the expense of the _many_, commerce, by creating\r\nand accumulating personal estate, haz introduced a new species of power\r\nto ballance the influence of the landed property. Commerce found its way\r\nfrom Italy and the eest, to Germany and England, diffusing in its\r\nprogress freedom, knowlege and independence. Commerce iz favorable to\r\nfreedom; it flurishes most in republics; indeed a free intercourse by\r\ntrade iz almost fatal to despotism; for which reezon, some princes lay\r\nit under severe restrictions: In other countries it iz discuraged by\r\npublic opinion, which renders trade disreputable. This iz more fatal to\r\nit, than the edicts of tyrants.\r\n\r\nThe basis of a democratic and a republican form of government, iz, a\r\nfundamental law, favoring an equal or rather a general distribution of\r\nproperty. It iz not necessary nor possible that every citizen should hav\r\nexactly an equal portion of land and goods, but the laws of such a state\r\nshould require an equal distribution of intestate estates, and bar all\r\nperpetuities. Such laws occasion constant revolutions of property, and\r\nthus hold out to all men equal motivs to vigilance and industry. They\r\nexcite emulation, by giving every citizen an equal chance of being rich\r\nand respectable.\r\n\r\nIn no one particular do the American states differ from European nations\r\nmore widely, than in the rules which regulate the tenure and\r\ndistribution of lands. This circumstance alone wil, for ages at leest,\r\nprezerve a government in the united states, very different from any\r\nwhich now exists or can arize in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn New England, intestate estates desend to all the children or other\r\nheirs in equal portions, except to the oldest son, who haz two shares.\r\nThis exception in favor of the oldest son, waz copied from the levitical\r\ncode, which waz made the basis of the first New England institutions.\r\nThe legislature of Massachusetts, at their May session, 1789, abolished\r\nthat absurd exception; and nothing but inveterate habit keeps it alive\r\nin the other states.[152]\r\n\r\n    [152] Lands in Connecticut desend to the heirs in the\r\n    following manner: First to children, and if none, then to\r\n    brothers and sisters or their legal representativs of the\r\n    whole blud; then to parents; then to brothers and sisters of\r\n    the half blud; then to next of kin, the whole blud taking the\r\n    preference when of equal degree with the half blud.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of theze laws, the peeple of New England enjoy an\r\nequality of condition, unknown in any other part of the world. To the\r\nsame cause may be ascribed the rapid population of theze states; for\r\nestates by division are kept small, by which meens every man iz obliged\r\nto labor, and labor iz the direct cause of population. For the same\r\nreezon, the peeple of theze states, feel and exert the pride of\r\nindependence. Their equality makes them mild and condesending, capable\r\nof being convinced and guverned by persuasion; but their independence\r\nrenders them irritable and obstinate in resisting force and oppression.\r\nA man by associating familiarly with them, may eezily coax them into hiz\r\nviews, but if he assumes any airs of superiority, he iz treeted with az\r\nlittle respect az a servant. The principal inconvenience arizing from\r\ntheze dispositions iz, that a man who happens to be a little\r\ndistinguished for hiz property or superior education iz ever exposed to\r\ntheir envy, and the tung of slander iz bizzy in backbiting him. In this\r\nmanner, they oppoze distinctions of rank, with great success. This\r\nhowever iz a private inconvenience; but there iz an evil, arising from\r\nthis jealousy, which deeply affects their guvernment. Averse to\r\ndistinctions, and reddy to humble superiority, they become the dupes of\r\na set of artful men, who, with small talents for business and no regard\r\nfor the public interest, are always familiar with every class of peeple,\r\nslyly hinting something to the disadvantage of great and honest men, and\r\npretending to be frends to the public welfare. The peeple are thus\r\nguverned at times by the most unqualified men among them. If a man wil\r\nshake hands with every one he meets, attend church constantly, and\r\nassume a goodly countenance; if he wil not swear or play cards, he may\r\narrive to the first offices in the guvernment, without one single talent\r\nfor the proper discharge of hiz duty; he may even defraud the public\r\nrevenu and be accused of it on the most indubitable evidence, yet by\r\nlaying hiz hand on hiz brest, casting hiz eyes to heaven, and calling\r\nGod to witness hiz innocence, he may wipe away the popular suspicions,\r\nand be a fairer candidate for preferment than before hiz accusation. So\r\nfar az the harts of the peeple are concerned, the disposition here\r\nmentioned iz a high recommendation, for it proves them mild,\r\nunsuspecting and humane: But guvernment suffers a material injury from\r\nthis turn of mind; and were it not for a few men who are boldly honest,\r\nand indefatigable in detecting impositions on the public, the guvernment\r\nof theze states would always be, az it often iz, in the hands of the\r\nweekest, or wickedest of the citizens.\r\n\r\nThe same equality of condition haz produced a singular manner of\r\nspeeking among the peeple of New England.[153] But the inhabitants of\r\nall the large towns, wel bred citizens, are excepted from this remark.\r\n\r\n    [153] See my Dissertations on the English Language, page 106.\r\n\r\nAltho the principle iz tru that a general distribution of lands iz the\r\nbasis of a republican form of guvernment, yet there iz an evil arising\r\nout of this distribution, which the New England states now feel, and\r\nwhich wil increase with the population of the country. The tracts of\r\nland first taken up by the settlers, were not very considerable; and\r\ntheze having been repeetedly divided among a number of heirs, hav left\r\nthe present proprietors almost without subsistence for their families.\r\nVast numbers of men do not possess more than thirty or forty akers eech,\r\nand many not half the quantity. It iz with difficulty that such men can\r\nsupport families and pay taxes. Indeed most of them are unable to do it;\r\nthey involve themselves in det; the creditors take the little land they\r\npossess, and the peeple are driven, poor and helpless, into an\r\nuncultivated wilderness. Such are the effects of an equal division of\r\nlands among heirs; and such the causes of emigration to the western\r\nterritories. Emigration indeed iz a present remedy for the evil; but\r\nwhen settlements hav raized the valu of the western lands neerly to that\r\non the Atlantic coast, emigrations wil mostly ceese. They wil not\r\nentirely ceese, until the continent iz peepled to the Pacific ocean; and\r\nthat period iz distant; but whenever they ceese, our republican\r\ninhabitants, unable to subsist on the small portions of land, assigned\r\nthem by the laws of division, must hav recourse to manufactures. The\r\nholders of land wil be fewer in number, because monied men wil hav the\r\nadvantage of purchasing lands very low of the necessitous inhabitants,\r\nwho wil be multiplied by the very laws of the state, respecting landed\r\nproperty. Other laws however could not be tolerated in theze states. In\r\nEurope, provision iz made for younger sons, in the army, the church, the\r\nnavy, or in the numerous manufactures of the countries. But in America,\r\nsuch provision cannot be made; and therefore our laws eezely provide for\r\nall the children, where they are not provided for by the parents.\r\n\r\nBy extending our views to futurity, we see considerable changes in the\r\ncondition of theze republican states. The laws, by barring entailments,\r\nprevent the establishment of families in permanent affluence; we are\r\ntherefore in little danger of a hereditary aristocracy. But the same\r\nlaws, by dividing inheritances, tho their first effect iz to create\r\nequality, ultimately tend to impoverish a great number of citizens, and\r\nthus giv a few men, who commanded money, an advantage in procuring lands\r\nat less than their real valu. The evil iz increased in a state, where\r\nthere iz a scarcity of cash, occasioned by the course of trade, or by\r\nlaws limiting the interest on money loaned. Such iz the case in\r\nConnecticut. A man who haz money may purchase wel cultivated farms in\r\nthat state for seventy, and sometimes for fifty per cent. of the real\r\nvalu. Such a situation iz favorable to the accumulation of great\r\nestates, and the creation of distinctions; but while alienations of real\r\nestates are rendered necessary by the laws, the genius of the guvernment\r\nwil not be materially changed.\r\n\r\nThe causes which destroyed the ancient republics were numerous; but in\r\nRome, one principal cause waz, the vast inequality of fortunes,\r\noccasioned partly by the stratagems of the patricians and partly by the\r\nspoils of their enemies, or the exactions of tribute in their conquered\r\nprovinces. Rome, with the _name_ of a republic, waz several ages loozing\r\nthe _spirit_ and _principle_. The Gracchi endevored to check the growing\r\nevil by an agrarian law; but were not successful. In Cesar's time, the\r\nRomans were ripened for a change of guvernment; the _spirit_ of a\r\ncommonwelth waz lost, and Cesar waz but an instrument of altering the\r\n_form_, when it could no longer exist. Cesar iz execrated az the tyrant\r\nof hiz country; and Brutus, who stabbed him, iz applauded az a _Roman_.\r\nBut such waz the state of things in Rome, that Cesar waz a better ruler\r\nthan Brutus would hav been; for when the spirit of a guvernment iz lost,\r\nthe form must change.\r\n\r\nBrutus would hav been a tyrannical demagogue, or hiz zeel to restore the\r\ncommonwelth would hav protracted the civil war and factions which raged\r\nin Rome and which finally must hav subsided in monarky. Cesar waz\r\nabsolute, but hiz guvernment waz moderate, and hiz name waz sufficient\r\nto repress faction and prezerve tranquillity. The zeel of Brutus waz\r\nintemperate and rash; for when abuses hav acquired a certain degree of\r\nstrength; when they are interwoven with every part of government, it iz\r\nprudence to suffer many evils, rather than risk the application of a\r\nviolent remedy.\r\n\r\nHow far the Roman history furnishes the data, on which the politicians\r\nof America may calculate the future changes in our form of guvernment,\r\niz left to every man's own opinion. Our citizens now hold lands in fee;\r\nthis renders them bold in independence: They all labor, and therefore\r\nmake hardy soldiers; they all reed, and of course understand their\r\nrights; they rove uncontrolled in the forest; therefore they know the\r\nuse of arms. But wil not poor peeple multiply, and the possessions of\r\nreal estates be diminished in number, and increesed in size? Must not a\r\ngreat proportion of our citizens becum manufacturers and thus looz the\r\nbodies and the spirit of soldiers? While the mass of knowlege wil be\r\nincreesed by discuveries and experience, wil it not be confined to fewer\r\nmen? In short, wil not our forests be levelled, or confined to a few\r\nproprietors? and when our peeple ceese to hunt, will not the body of\r\nthem neglect the use of arms? Theze are questions of magnitude; but the\r\npresent generation can answer them only in prospect and speculation. At\r\nany rate, the genius of every guvernment must addapt itself to the\r\npeculiar state and spirit of the peeple who compose the state, and when\r\nthe Americans looz the _principles_ of a free guvernment, it follows\r\nthat they wil speedily looz the _form_. Such a change would, az in Rome,\r\nbe ascribed to _bad_ men; but it is more rational to ascribe it to an\r\nimperceptible progress of corruption, or thoze insensible changes which\r\nsteel into the best constitutions of government.\r\n\r\nNew England waz originally settled by a religious sect, denominated\r\n_puritans_, who fled from the severe restraints imposed upon dissenters\r\nin the reign of king James I. Placed beyond the feer of control, they\r\nformed sistems of civil and ecclesiastical government, exactly suited to\r\ntheir rigid notions. All their institutions wear marks of an\r\nenthusiastic zeel for religion. Removed from the tyranny of one church,\r\nthey vibrated to the other extreme, and with an ardor to bild up\r\nChrist's kingdom, in what they quaintly call, _a howling wilderness_,\r\nthey established a tyranny of the severest kind over the consciences and\r\nrights of their own society, and by arbitrary decrees banished thoze\r\nwho dissented from them upon the most metaphisical points. It waz a law\r\nof the first settlers at Boston, that none could be free men and\r\nentitled to vote for civil rulers, who were not in full communion with\r\nthe church; and none could be admitted to full communion, without the\r\nrecommendation of a clergyman. Theze laws threw all the power of the\r\nstate into the hands of the clergy.[154] It iz equally astonishing and\r\nridiculous to the posterity of thoze godly peeple, to find the church\r\nand state, in the infancy of the settlement in America, rent with\r\ndiscord upon the simple question, whether \"sanctification preceeds\r\njustification.\" Yet hundreds of councils were held upon this or similar\r\npoints, and a dissent from the common opinion on such trifling\r\nquestions, waz heresy, punishable with excommunication and banishment.\r\n\r\n    [154] See Winthrop's Journal, Mather's Magnalia, and\r\n    Hutchisons Collection of papers.\r\n\r\nBut candor requires some apology to be made for our ancestors. Bigotry\r\nwaz not confined to the New England settlers; it waz the characteristic\r\nof the age. The first settlers in New Jersey, Virginia and Pensylvania,\r\nand indeed in most of the colonies, prohibited witchcraft under penalty\r\nof deth; tho the laws seem not to have been executed any where except in\r\nMassachusetts. But the fame gloomy superstition reigned in England. The\r\nstatutes of Henry VIII. and James I. making witchcraft and sorcery\r\nfelony without benefit of clergy, upon which many persons suffered deth,\r\nwere not repeeled, till the ninth yeer of George II. or about 1736. Just\r\nbefore the restoration in 1660, no less than thirteen _gypsies_ were\r\ncondemned at one Suffolk assizes, and executed.\r\n\r\nBut why should I go to former times and other states for apologies? Iz\r\nit not eezy to find superstition and prejudices among ourselves equally\r\nabsurd and indefensible? Does not a law against playing with cards\r\nproceed from theze prejudices? What iz the difference between playing\r\nwith _spotted papers and spotted boards_? Chequers, back-gammon and\r\nchess are not prohibited, and the games are az enticing az thoze which\r\nare prohibited. Are not such games az capable of conceelment az any\r\ndomestic concerns? Wil laws ever reech them? Haz the legislature any\r\nright to control my family amuzements? In short, do laws ever suppress\r\nor restrain any species of game? By no meens; on the other hand, I can\r\ntestify from actual observation, that prohibited games are practized az\r\nmuch az others, and in states where penalties against them are most\r\nsevere, gaming iz the most frequent.\r\n\r\nAgain, are laws against witchcraft more absurd than laws against usury?\r\nDid not both originate in ages of monkish bigotry, and in the same\r\nreligious scruples? Iz it not az illiberal a prejudice to say, that a\r\nman shall hav but six per cent. profit on money loaned, yet may make\r\nfifty per cent. if he can, on the same valu in goods, houses or lands;\r\naz it iz to say, that a man shal not be a fanatic, or a woman hav the\r\nhysterics? Haz not any man az good a right to be whimsical or\r\nsuperstitious, az a legislature to be inconsistent? Az to the right, I\r\nsee no difference. A man who iz oppressed to an obvious degree by a rich\r\ncreditor, wil find releef against the oppressor, in a court of equity. A\r\nfanatic, who should keep a naborhood in an uproar by hiz religious\r\nworship, would be punishable for a misdemeenor. But when two men can\r\nmake a voluntary contract for eight per cent. interest, a contract which\r\neech deems favorable for himself, that he should be punishable with a\r\nhevvy forfiture, iz a curosity in legislation, which ought to be placed\r\non the catalog of papal bulls.\r\n\r\nSuperstition appeers in all ages under different aspects. The sailor who\r\nrepozes confidence in the horse-shoe on hiz mast, the Roman who counts\r\nhiz beeds, the judge who gravely sentences a witch to the gallows, and\r\nthe legislator who thinks it a crime to receev great profits for the use\r\nof money, may be equally conscientious, and to posterity in some future\r\ntime, wil appeer to be equally mistaken.\r\n\r\nBut while we contemplate the censurable laws of the first New England\r\nsettlers, let us not pass by many excellent regulations which proceed\r\nfrom their religious zeel, and which hav been the basis of institutions\r\nthe most favorable to morals, to freedom and happiness.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, our ancestors made provision for supporting\r\npreechers of the gospel in every village. Abating some rigid maxims,\r\nwhich were propagated and maintained for the first century, with too\r\nmuch zeel, the influence of the clergy, in New England, haz been\r\nproductiv of the happiest effects. The clergy, being wel informed men,\r\nand scattered among the peeple at large, hav been instrumental in\r\ndiffusing knowlege. Frends to order, and respected by their\r\nparishioners, they hav at times saved the states from turbulence and\r\ndisorder. The advocates of liberty, they espoused the American\r\nrevolution with firmness, and contributed to unite the peeple in a\r\nsteddy opposition to British mezures; and since the establishment of\r\npeece, they hav had no small influence in oppozing mezures, fatal to\r\ngood faith and the rights of freemen.\r\n\r\nThe effects of their influence are the most generally vizible in\r\nConnecticut, where every town iz well settled and supports a clergyman.\r\nThis state never experienced an insurrection; its opposition to the\r\nBritish power, during the war, waz steddy and unanimous; and tender laws\r\nand paper currency hav been uniformly reprobated since the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe old settlements in Massachusetts may fall under the same character;\r\nbut the western and northern counties are exceptions. In a great\r\nproportion of the townships, which hav been lately settled, there iz no\r\nclergyman or other person of superior information, to direct the popular\r\ncouncils and check a rizing opposition. It waz obzerved, during the late\r\ninsurrections in thoze counties, that the towns which were destitute of\r\nany wel informed men, furnished the most numerous and most turbulent\r\nhosts of insurgents. The wel informed counties on the see coast\r\nfurnished scarcely a man.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, it may be remarked, that the mildness of manners\r\nand the hospitality which prevail among the yemanry of New England, are\r\nascribeable in a great meazure, to a general administration of religious\r\nordinances. The distinction in this respect, iz so great between New\r\nEngland and some other parts of America, that in travelling among the\r\nsettlers on the frontiers of Vermont, a man may ascertain where the\r\nsettlers were born and educated, merely by their manner of receeving and\r\ntreeting him. This iz asserted from actual obzervation.\r\n\r\nThe State of Rhode Island furnishes full proofs of what iz here said in\r\nfavor of the clergy. That state waz settled by refugees from\r\nMassachusetts, who were banished or persecuted by the first settlers,\r\nfor their religious tenets. Roger Williams and hiz adherents imbibed an\r\ninveterate hatred against the colony of Massachusetts, and in particular\r\nagainst the clergy, whoze rigid zeel occasioned their expulsion from the\r\ncolony. The prejudice continued among their desendants, and to this day\r\nthe inhabitants boast of their liberality of sentiment and their freedom\r\nfrom the bigotry of clergymen, which, they say, enslaves the peeple of\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut. This aversion to the clerical order haz\r\nhowever had a pernicious effect in the state. The body of the peeple,\r\nunaccustomed to the sobriety and decent deportment necessary in\r\nreligious worship, and despizing the puritanical manners of their\r\nnabors, are educated in licentiousness and void of principle. To this\r\nsource may be traced the most unjust and tyrannical laws that ever\r\ndisgraced a popular assembly, and a perseverance in executing them,\r\nwhich can proceed only from obstinate ignorance and dishonest views. The\r\nlarge trading towns are excepted from this description; the inhabitants\r\nof which are well informed, polite, liberal, and firm supporters of good\r\ngovernment; _but they encourage schools and support a respectable\r\nclergy_.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, our ancestors discuvered their wizdom in\r\nestablishing public schools and colleges. The law of Connecticut\r\nordains, that every town, or parish containing seventy householders,\r\nshall keep an English school, at leest eleven months in a yeer; and\r\ntowns containing a less number, at leest six months in a yeer. Every\r\ntown keeping a public skool iz entitled to draw from the trezury of the\r\nstate, a certain sum of money, proportioned to its census in the list of\r\nproperty which furnishes the rule of taxation. This sum might hav been\r\noriginally sufficient to support one skool in each town or parish; but\r\nin modern times, iz divided among a number, and the deficiency of money\r\nto support the skools iz raised upon the estates of the peeple, in the\r\nmanner the public taxes are assessed. To extend the benefits of this\r\nestablishment to all the inhabitants, large towns and parishes are\r\ndivided into districts; eech of which iz supposed able to furnish a\r\ncompetent number of skolars for one skool. In eech district a house iz\r\nerected for the purpose by the inhabitants of that district; who hire a\r\nmaster, furnish wood, and tax themselves to pay all expenses, not\r\nprovided for by the public money. The skool iz kept during the winter\r\nmonths, when every farmer can spare hiz sons. In this manner every child\r\nin the state haz access to a school. In the summer, a woman iz hired to\r\nteech small children, who are not fit for any kind of labor. In the\r\nlarge towns, skools, ether public or private, are kept the whole yeer;\r\nand in every county town, a grammar school iz established by law.\r\n\r\nThe state of Massachusetts haz also public schools on similar\r\nprinciples. The colleges and academies are too well known to need any\r\ndescription or remarks.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial effects of theze institutions will be experienced for\r\nages. Next to the establishments in favor of religion, they hav been the\r\nnurseries of wel-informed citizens, brave soldiers and wize legislators.\r\nA peeple thus informed are capable of understanding their rights and of\r\ndiscuvering the meens to secure them.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, our forefathers took mezures to prezerve the\r\nreputation of skools and the morals of yuth, by making the business of\r\nteeching them an honorable employment. Every town or district haz a\r\ncommittee whoze duty iz to procure a master of talents and karacter;\r\nand the practice iz to procure a man of the best character in the town\r\nor naborhood. The welthy towns apply to yung gentlemen of liberal\r\neducation, who, after taking the bachelor's degree, usually keep skool a\r\nyeer or two, before they enter upon a profession. One of the most\r\nunfortunate circumstances to education in the middle and suthern states,\r\niz, an opinion that skool keeping iz a meen employment, fit only for\r\npersons of low karacter. The retches who keep the skools in thoze\r\nstates, very frequently degrade the employment; but the misfortune iz,\r\npublic opinion suppozes the employment degrades the man: Of course no\r\ngentleman will undertake to teech children, while, in popular\r\nestimation, he must forfit hiz rank and karacter by the employment.\r\nUntil public opinion iz corrected by some great examples, the common\r\nschools, what few there are in thoze states, must continu in the hands\r\nof such vagabonds az wander about the country.\r\n\r\nNeerly connected with the establishment of skools, iz the circulation of\r\nnewspapers in New England. This iz both a consequence and a cause of a\r\ngeneral diffusion of letters. In Connecticut, almost every man reeds a\r\npaper every week. In the yeer 1785, I took some pains to ascertain the\r\nnumber of papers printed weekly in Connecticut, and in the suthern\r\nstates. I found the number in Connecticut to be neerly eight thousand;\r\nwhich waz equal to that published in the whole territory, south of\r\nPensylvania.[155] By meens of this general circulation of public papers,\r\nthe peeple are informed of all political affairs; and their\r\nrepresentativs are often prepared to deliberate on propositions, made to\r\nthe legislature.\r\n\r\n    [155] During the late war, eight thousand newspapers were\r\n    published weekly at one press in Hartford.\r\n\r\nAnother institution favorable to knowlege, iz the establishment of\r\nparish libraries. Theze are procured by subscription, but they are\r\nnumerous, the expense not being considerable, and the desire of reeding\r\nuniversal. One hundred volums of books, selected from the best writers\r\non ethics, divinity and history, and red by the principal inhabitants of\r\na town or village, wil hav an amazing influence in spreding knowlege,\r\ncorrecting the morals and softening the manners of a nation. I am\r\nacquainted with parishes, where almost every housholder haz red the\r\nworks of Addison, Sherlock, Atterbury, Watts, Young, and other similar\r\nwritings; and wil converse handsomely on the subjects of which they\r\ntreet.\r\n\r\nStill further, the wisdom of the erly settlers in New England iz\r\nremarkable in the division of their territorial jurisdictions into\r\ntownships, and incorporating them with certain powers of a subordinate\r\nnature. Every town iz a corporate body, with power to appoint, at an\r\nannual meeting, certain town magistrates, called _selectmen_, who hav\r\nthe charge of providing for the poor, superintending the town property,\r\ndispozing of the monies &c. rendering an account to the town at the\r\nannual meeting. The towns also appoint constables, _collectors of\r\ntaxes_,[156] surveyors of roads, tithing men, whoze business iz to\r\nprezerve order on Sundays, inspectors of various denominations, &c. The\r\ntowns are obliged to bild and repair their own bridges, repair roads,\r\nand defray the expense by a tax impozed by themselves. They also support\r\ntheir own poor. This system of subordinate legislation haz the advantage\r\nof saving the legislature much trubble, and the corporations can hardly\r\nabuse powers, which are limited to their own territories; nor wil they\r\nprobably neglect their duty, az it iz for their interest and convenience\r\nto perform it.\r\n\r\n    [156] This iz an evil of great magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn the general organization of guvernment, the New England states differ\r\nwidely; thoze of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, being formed since the\r\nrevolution, are wel known; thoze of Connecticut and Rhode Island are\r\nmoddled upon the charters of Charles II, and have suffered but little\r\nalteration, since their first establishment.\r\n\r\nThe New England colonies were originally guverned by a cheef magistrate\r\nor guvernor, a deputy, and a certain number of assistants, all chosen by\r\nthe peeple. They were called the court of assistants, and for a\r\nconsiderable time, exercized all powers, legislativ and judicial. The\r\nclergy were uzually associated with them, and they seem to hav taken\r\ncognizance likewise of ecclesiastical matters. The rulers of peeple in\r\nsmall societies, in erly settlements, and in the simple state of nature,\r\nuzually hav discretionary powers to act for the common good. This waz\r\nthe case with the ancient witena-gemote, and folk-motes or county\r\nmeetings in England; and with the first legislatures in theze colonies.\r\n\r\nThe towns soon began to send representativs to the court; but for\r\nseveral yeers in Boston, they sat in the same house with the assistants;\r\nin the same manner az the knights of shires, or representativs of the\r\ninferior barons, sat in parliament with the lords on their first\r\nintroduction into the legislature. But az the towns multiplied, this\r\npractice waz found inconvenient, and the deputies were separated from\r\nthe assistants. When this took place the assistants rezerved to\r\nthemselves the judiciary powers, which at first were lodged in the whole\r\nassembly. In Connecticut, the assistants or upper house of assembly\r\nretained theze powers in effect, till the late revolution; only for the\r\nsake of convenience, five of their number were appointed by both houses,\r\nto the immediate exercize of the office and to ride the circuit. Still\r\nthe assembly were a court of appeels in the last rezort, to all intents\r\nand purposes; for on petition, any judgement or decree might be heerd\r\nand reversed by the legislature. Since the revolution, a supreme court\r\nof errors iz constituted, but on an exceptionable plan, and the\r\nlegislature continues to exercize supreme judicial power on petitions.\r\nThis iz a remnant of the old administration, which was once harmless, if\r\nnot necessary; but in a large community, may be considered az a faulty\r\npart of the guvernment. The whole legislature likewise acts az a court\r\nfor the trial of public delinquents. This iz an evil of unbounded\r\nmagnitude. When charges are exhibited against any public officer, or any\r\nobjections made to hiz re-appointment, he iz admitted to a hearing,\r\ncouncil iz employed, the charges are red, witnesses examined, and the\r\ndelinquent makes hiz defence in person or by attorney. This mode of\r\nimpeachment and trial iz the worst that can be invented. It iz difficult\r\nor impossible for a large popular assembly to be good judges; they\r\ncannot perfectly understand a case; they are credulous; and their\r\ncompassion eezily moved. A pathetic harang, especially from the accused\r\nhimself, with teers in hiz eyes, and the misfortunes of hiz family\r\npainted in discription, wil skreen from punishment any knave, however\r\nnumerous hiz crimes, or however convincing the proofs of hiz gilt. A\r\npopular assembly should not sit in judgement upon delinquents, for the\r\nsame reezon that wimen would be improper judges, and for the same\r\nreezons that the mother and wife of Coriolanus were the only persons who\r\ncould save Rome from his vengence.[157]\r\n\r\n    [157] Uxor deinde ac liberi amplexi; fletusque ab omni turba\r\n    mulierum ortus, et comploratio sui patriæque, _fregere tandem\r\n    virum_.--Liv. lib ii. 40.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Connecticut iz if possible, more defectiv in the\r\ntrezury or finance department. The trezurer iz annually appointed by the\r\nfreemen in the state at large. This makes him dependent on them. The\r\ncollectors are scattered in every part of the state; and if the trezurer\r\niz not agreeable to them, az he wil not be, if he iz rigorous in\r\nenforcing collections, they can render him unpopular and throw him out\r\nof office. This iz an evil; besides, the constables, who are collectors,\r\nare appointed by the towns; if they are rigorous in their duty, they are\r\nliable to looz their office; or what iz worse, they may set up az\r\ncandidates for the legislature, and by an influence arizing from their\r\npower in exacting taxes with a greater or less degree of rigor, procure\r\nan election to an employment for which they are wholly unqualified.\r\nWhen a considerable number of collectors hav obtained seets in the\r\nlegislature, they are ever reddy to delay or suspend the collection of\r\ntaxes. This iz not the worst part of the system. The method of obtaining\r\nthe money in default of the collectors, iz tedious, expensiv,\r\nineffectual, and in short ridiculous. When a collector iz in arreer, a\r\ndistress issues from the trezury against hiz estate. Upon a return of\r\n_non est_, or in case of the collector's insolvency, execution issues\r\nagainst the selectmen of the town, whose estates are liable for the\r\narreerages of taxes. The selectmen then levy a tax upon the inhabitants\r\nto indemnify themselves.\r\n\r\nIt would be endless to enumerate the evils arizing out of this mode of\r\ncollection. If the trezurer was appointed by the legislature, with power\r\nto name his collectors and call them to account; and if collectors were\r\nobliged to giv bonds with sufficient security to save the state from\r\nloss, which security should be liable to distress immediately on failure\r\nof the collector, the taxes would be collected with promptitude and a\r\ngreat saving of expense.\r\n\r\nIt may be obzerved, that the faults of the constitution are ascribeable\r\nto the ancient simplicity of the New England peeple, and the corruptions\r\nof the administration hav grown out of the long tranquillity of the\r\nstate. While the peeple had perfect confidence in their rulers, they\r\nwere not disposed to disobey the laws; and while there were few\r\nopportunities of corruptions, there might be no instance of\r\nmaladministration, so obvious or atrocious az to alarm enquiry, and\r\nexcite peeple to change laws and forms, to which they had been\r\nfamiliarized. The inconveniencies resulting from a union of the\r\nlegislativ and judicial powers in the same hands, were not so great az\r\nto be sensibly felt by the public; and habits of respect for men in\r\noffice, and submission to law, had rendered men credulous and\r\nunsuspecting. To this day, it iz difficult to make the inhabitants\r\nbeleev that their rulers and magistrates can betray a public trust. Till\r\nwithin two yeers, the guvernor, deputy guvernor, judges of the superior\r\ncourt, or two justices of the peece, could draw upon the trezury of\r\nConnecticut, without their accounts being examined by any controller or\r\nauditor.\r\n\r\nBefore the legislature could be persuaded to institute a controller's\r\noffice az a check upon the trezury, it waz necessary to exhibit to them\r\nstrong proofs of maladministration in that department; and the evils\r\narizing from the prezent mode of collecting taxes, must be obvious and\r\ngreat, before they wil make any change in the system. Men are guverned\r\nby habit. The first laws of a country take their complection from the\r\npeculiar cast and circumstances of the peeple; and then the laws in turn\r\ncontribute to form the manners of succeeding generations. The state of\r\nConnecticut iz an illustrious example of this truth. By its situation,\r\nit can never be expozed to sudden changes by an influx of foreigners. It\r\nhaz no great capital, no general mart where all business centers; it haz\r\nvery little intercourse with Europe; and the communication by water\r\nbetween New York and Rhode Island iz so direct, eezy and cheep, that for\r\nnine months in the yeer, few peeple travel thro Connecticut. For theze\r\nreezons, ancient manners and habits will be prezerved longer in this\r\nstate than in most of the others.\r\n\r\nThere iz one article in the constitution of this state that merits\r\nnotice and imitation, because it iz equally singular and excellent. It\r\niz the manner of electing the assistants or senators of their own\r\nlegislature, and the members of congress. Theze are elected by the\r\nfreemen at large in the whole state. The number of senators iz twelve,\r\nand chosen annually in this manner. In September, the _freemen_ assemble\r\nin the towns and vote for twenty persons, by ballot; the votes are all\r\nreturned to the legislature in October, and numbered; and the twenty\r\nnames that hav the most votes are said to stand in _nomination_, and are\r\npublished by order of assembly. The next April, the freemen assemble\r\nagain, and vote by ballot for _twelv_ of the _twenty_, and the _twelv_\r\npersons who hav the most votes, are elected. Representatives in congress\r\nare chozen in a similar manner. The great excellence of this mode of\r\nchoozing iz, it holds up to public view, six months before election,\r\nthe karacters who are candidates; peeple hav an opportunity of enquiring\r\ninto their merits, that they may select from the whole thoze who are the\r\nleest exceptionable.\r\n\r\nIt iz also a singular advantage that one branch of the legislature\r\nstands upon the suffrages of the whole. If a man's nabors take a dislike\r\nto hiz public or private conduct, they wil, if possible, dismiss him\r\nfrom office. This iz the great misfortune of small district elections,\r\nfor it often happens that a man's integrity and independence in public\r\nmezures, are most likely to render him unpopular among hiz nabors; and\r\nsometimes small domestic occurrences may turn the tide of favor against\r\nhim. But when a man iz elected by a large district, he iz not expozed to\r\nthis evil; and nothing short of a general opposition to popular mezures\r\nwill shake him from hiz elevation. Theze remarks hav been repeetedly\r\nverified in Connecticut. The independence of the senate, owing mostly to\r\nthis article in the constitution, haz several times saved the state from\r\nthe most disgraceful acts.\r\n\r\nThe representativs are chozen twice a yeer, for there are two regular\r\nsessions of the legislature. This iz an inconvenience, but not so great,\r\naz it appears to our suthern nabors; for the freemen meet in towns,\r\nwhich are but about six miles square; so that they can go from home,\r\nmake a choice, and return in three hours.\r\n\r\nThe regularity of theze meetings iz incredible to strangers, accustomed\r\nto the tumultuous elections in England and the suthern states. No man\r\ndare solicit for the votes of hiz nabors, nor ever offers himself a\r\ncandidate by advertizing. The freemen meet in some public bilding,\r\nuzually a church, seet themselves, heer the law red respecting\r\nelections, and proclamation iz made that they prepare their ballots for\r\nthe officer to be chozen. The constables then carry a hat to every\r\nfreeman and take the votes, which are counted by the civil authority,\r\nand the choice declared in the meeting. Thus the representativs are\r\nelected; but the ballots for guvernor, deputy guvernor, senators, and\r\ndelegates to congress, are seeled up, and sent to Hartford, where they\r\nare numbered at the annual election in May. The choice iz conducted with\r\nneerly the same sobriety az public worship on Sunday. How different the\r\nelections in the suthern states, where I hav seen candidates march at\r\nthe hed of their adherents, armed with clubs, and force their way to the\r\nplace of election, and by violence thrusting away their rivals! It is a\r\nmisfortune in thoze states, that the freemen of a _whole county_\r\nassemble at elections. This iz one principal cause, why the elections\r\nare attended with tumults, riots, quarrels, bloody nozes, and in a few\r\ninstances, with deth. The laws of a republic should gard against all\r\nlarge collections of peeple either for good or bad purposes: They are\r\nalways dangerous. Rome furnishes innumerable lessons on this subject;\r\nand if the suthern legislatures attend to facts, they wil doubtless\r\ndivide their counties into small districts for the purpose of election,\r\nand hav the choice completed in one day; that the candidates might not\r\nbe able to hed their frends in more places than one. It iz of infinit\r\nconsequence that the pernicious influence of elections should be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nReligion in Connecticut haz the support of law. Contracts with clergymen\r\nare valid in law, and every man iz compelled to pay hiz proportion of\r\ntaxes to pay the salary of the minister of the parish where he resides,\r\nunless he produces du proof that he attends worship with some dissenting\r\ncongregation; in which case he iz excuzed. This iz considered by\r\nstrangers az a hardship: But it produces few inconveniencies in a state\r\nwhere there are few dissenters from the common worship; and theze few\r\nare exempted, if they attend _any_ religious worship. Every person iz\r\nindulged in worshiping az he pleezes; and whatever modern liberality may\r\npretend, the regular preeching of the gospel, az a _civil_ institution,\r\niz az necessary and useful, az the establishment of skools or courts of\r\njustice. Without any regard to compulsion over consciences, or any\r\nreference to a future life, a legal provision for the moral instructors\r\nof men, iz az beneficial in society, az any civil or literary\r\ninstitution whatever; and a commonalty, who hav not the benefit of such\r\ninstruction, wil, I presume to assert, always be ignorant, and of ruf\r\nuncivil manners. It iz an article of some constitutions in America, that\r\nclergymen shal hold no civil office. This exclusion iz founded on just\r\naz good reezons, az the old laws against witchcraft; a clergyman being\r\nno more dangerous in a civil office, than a witch in civil society. It\r\niz said that the business of clergymen iz divine and spiritual, and that\r\nthey should hav no concern with politics. The objection iz equally good\r\nagainst merchants, mechanics and farmers, who hav no immediate concern\r\nwith legislation. The truth iz, every citizen haz a concern in the laws\r\nwhich guvern him; and a clergyman haz the same concern with civil laws,\r\naz other men. There hav been bad clergymen and tyrannical hierarkies in\r\nthe world; but the error lies in separating the civil from the\r\necclesiastical government. When separated they become rivals; when\r\nunited, they hav the same interest to pursu. A clergyman's business iz\r\nto _inform_ hiz peeple, and to make them _good men_. This iz the way to\r\nmake them _good citizens_. The clergymen in Boston take the right method\r\nto accomplish this business; they throw aside all _divine airs_ and\r\nimperious grave superiority; they mingle in the most familiar manner,\r\nwith other peeple; they are social and facetious, and their parishoners\r\ndelight to hav them at all entertainments and concerts. This conduct\r\nremoovs the awful distance between them and other descriptions of men;\r\nthey are not only esteemed and respected, but luved; their decent\r\ndeportment iz imitated; their churches are crowded, and their\r\ninstructions listened to with plezure. Such men are blessings to\r\nsociety. That clergymen ought not to meddle with politics, iz so far\r\nfrom truth, that they ought to be _well_ acquainted with the subject,\r\nand _better_ than most classes of men, in proportion to their literary\r\nattainments. Religion and policy ought ever to go hand in hand; not to\r\nraize a system of despotism over the consciences, but to enlighten the\r\nminds, soften the harts, correct the manners and restrain the vices of\r\nmen. If men are to be fitted for heaven, it _must_ be by theze meens;\r\nthere iz no other way. The separation of religion and policy, of church\r\nand state, waz owing at first to the errors of a gloomy superstition,\r\nwhich exalted the ministers of Christ into Deities; who, like other men,\r\nunder similar advantages, became tyrants. The way to check their\r\nambition, and to giv full efficacy to their administrations, iz to\r\nconsider them az _men_ and _citizens_, entitled to all the benefits of\r\nguvernment, subject to law, and designed for _civil_ az wel az\r\n_spiritual_ instructors.\r\n\r\nThe state of New York waz settled with views, widely different from\r\nthoze which actuated the New England puritans. Some Dutch merchants\r\nfirst established factories at Albany and on Manhattans, now York\r\nIsland, for the purpose of opening a fur trade. When the province came\r\ninto the possession of the English, several gentlemen of property took\r\nup large tracts of lands, which, being regulated by the English laws of\r\ndescent, continued unbroken, til the late revolution. But many of the\r\nproprietors of theze manors, espousing the royal cause in the late\r\ncontest, left their estates, which were of course confiscated and sold\r\nby the state. This circumstance waz fatal to many large manors; and a\r\nlaw of the state, enacted about the yeer 1781, which breaks the present\r\nand bars all future entailments, wil in time divide the large estates\r\nwhich remain unbroken. The Dutch possess the most fertile parts of the\r\nold settlements; az Ulster and Claverak counties, part of Albany and\r\nKings county, on Long Island. They are honest and economical, but\r\nindolent, and destitute of enterprize; so that the state wil be mostly\r\nindetted to emigrants from New England, for its future population and\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nNew York city iz the most favorable stand for a great commercial port on\r\nthe united states. Men may indulge themselves in rapsodies, about the\r\nPotomack, the Ohio and the Missisippi; but no part of theze states,\r\neest of the Allegany, wil ever rival New York, and it iz doutful whether\r\nthe same conveniencies for business unite on any part of the Missisippi.\r\nNew York iz the center of the commerce of all the territory, between the\r\nwestern boundary of Rhode Island and the middle of New Jersey, from the\r\nAtlantic neerly to the borders of Canada; a district of two hundred\r\nmiles by two hundred and fifty. And the geography of the country tells\r\nus, that no part of Atlantic America can claim the same extensiv\r\nadvantages. New York iz not eezily defended in time of war, and\r\ntherefore, without a navy, iz not a safe place for an arsenal; but West\r\nPoint, sixty miles abuv the city, on the Hudson, iz the most impregnable\r\nfortress in America.\r\n\r\nBefore the revolution, the guvernment of New York waz under the\r\ninfluence of the crown of Great Britain, the guvernor and council being\r\nappointed by the king. It waz illiberal in the preference given to the\r\nepiscopal church; no other denomination of Christians being able to\r\nobtain any corporate establishment. The same illiberal preference waz\r\ndiscuverable in the institution and guvernment of the college, now\r\ncalled Columbia college, in which dissenters of any description could\r\nnot hav a share. The revolution haz effected a change in theze\r\nparticulars. Dissenting churches, which are the most numerous in the\r\nstate, are or may be incorporated; and education begins to be encuraged\r\nby the laws. A university iz established, with a power of superintending\r\nand regulating skools throughout the state; but provision iz not made\r\nfor maintaining common skools in every quarter of the state. Ignorance\r\nstil prevails among the yemanry; and this enables certain designing\r\nkaracters to exercise a pernicious influence in the guvernment.\r\n\r\nThe territory of New Jersey originally belonged to two, and afterwards\r\nto many proprietors, who appointed the guvernors. But in the reign of\r\nqueen Ann, the guvernment waz resigned to the crown, and for a number of\r\nyeers, the guvernor of New York waz also guvernor of the Jersies, altho\r\neech province had a distinct assembly. The heirs of the original\r\nproprietors, or their purchasers, stil hold the soil. There are in this\r\nstate many large estates, but an entailment iz good only to the first\r\ndonee in tail; the estate, on hiz deth intestate, being divided equally\r\namong hiz heirs. In general the laws of New Jersey are highly\r\nrepublican; but they make no provision for a general diffusion of\r\nknowlege. Many of the yemanry are extremely ignorant. The college at\r\nPrinceton iz a very valuable institution; but so little concern haz the\r\nlegislature for the interest of lerning, that the funds of that college\r\nare taxed by law.\r\n\r\nThe present constitution of New Jersey iz liable to few exceptions; but\r\nthe state iz divided into two parties which often agitate the\r\nguvernment. Az the cause and effects of the controversy which began and\r\nstil continues theze parties, are little known to their nabors, I beg\r\nleev here to offer a concise state of the facts from unquestionable\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nJames, duke of York, in June 1664, conveyed New Jersey to John, lord\r\nBerkeley, and Sir George Carteret, in fee. The bounds of the territory\r\ngranted were, the main see and Hudson's river on the eest, Delaware bay\r\nor river on the west, Cape May on the south, and on the north _the\r\nnorthernmost branch of Delaware bay, or river, which iz forty one\r\ndegrees and forty minutes of latitude, crossing over thence in strait\r\nline to Hudson's river, in forty one degrees of latitude_.\r\n\r\nSome intermediate conveyances of lord Berkeley's undivided half part\r\nwere made, but need not be here recited. On the first of July, 1676, waz\r\nexecuted a quintipartite deed, between Sir George Carteret, and the\r\ngrantees of lord Berkely, by which the territory waz divided; Sir George\r\nCarteret releesing all the western part to the grantees of Berkeley, and\r\nthe latter releesing the eestern part to Sir George. The line of\r\npartition, which originated all the subsequent disputes, iz thus\r\ndescribed in the deed: \"Extending eestward and northward along the see\r\ncoast and the said river, called Hudson's river, from the eest side of a\r\ncertain place or harbor, lying on the suthern part of the same tract of\r\nland, and commonly called and known in a map of the same, by the name of\r\n_Little Egg Harbor_, to that part of the said Hudson's river, which iz\r\nin forty one degrees of latitude, being the furthermost part of said\r\ntract of land and premises, which iz bounded by the said river, and\r\ncrossing over from thence in a strait line, extending from that part of\r\nHudson's river aforesaid, to the northernmost part or branch of the\r\nbefore mentioned river, called Delaware river, and to the most northerly\r\npoint or boundary of the said tract of land and premises, granted by hiz\r\nroyal highness, James, duke of York, to lord Berkeley and Sir George\r\nCarteret.\"\r\n\r\nA difficulty aroze about the northern point of partition; the duke of\r\nYork's grant making the northernmost branch of Delaware bay or river to\r\nbe in _forty one degrees and forty minutes_ of latitude; and declaring a\r\nline from this point to the latitude of _forty one_ on Hudson's river,\r\nto be the northern boundary of New Jersey. Disputes aroze, and the\r\nlegislature of New Jersey, in 1719, passed an act, declaring that a\r\npartition line between Eest and West Jersey, shall be run _from the most\r\nnortherly point or boundary of the province, on the northernmost branch\r\nof Delaware river_, to the most sutherly point of Little Egg Harbor.\r\nCommissioners were appointed for this purpose, and also for running the\r\nline between New York and New Jersey. They met with commissioners from\r\nNew York, but could not agree, and left the business unfinished. In\r\n1741, another attempt waz made by Mr. Alexander, surveyor general of\r\nboth divisions, but obnoxious to the West Jersey proprietors. He began\r\nto run the line, but some errors he committed, or bad instruments,\r\nprevented the completion of the business; he stopped half way. Disputes\r\nran high, and were attended with riots, till the yeers 1762 and 1764,\r\nwhen by a law of New York and another of New Jersey, it waz agreed the\r\nline between the provinces should be run by commissioners to be\r\nappointed by the crown. To this agreement the proprietors of West\r\nJersey az well az Eest, were parties. The commissioners met, fixed the\r\ntwo station points between New York and New Jersey, one at a rock on\r\nHudson's river, in forty one degrees of latitude, the other at the forks\r\nof the Delaware, at the mouth of the river Makhakamak, in latitude 41°.\r\n21'. 37\". This point on Delaware iz _eighteen minutes twenty three\r\nseconds_, to the suthward of the _northern boundary_ of New Jersey, az\r\ndescribed in the duke of York's grant to the first proprietors; which\r\nwaz, on the _northernmost branch of Delaware river, which iz forty one\r\ndegrees forty minutes_ of latitude.\r\n\r\nBoth parties appeeled to the crown, but without success. Acts were\r\nafterwards passed, both by New York and New Jersey, confirming the line\r\nbetween the provinces, and theze acts receeved the approbation of the\r\nking in council. This waz an amicable settlement between the two\r\nprovinces; and it waz expected that the _northern limits of New Jersey_\r\nand the _station points_ on both rivers, being fixed by law, nothing waz\r\nnecessary to quiet all parties, but to run the line from the north\r\nstation point on Delaware to Little Egg Harbor.\r\n\r\nA correspondence for this purpose took place between the proprietors of\r\nEest and West Jersey; but before the matter waz completed the war\r\ncommenced. Since the war, the controversies hav been revived, and\r\ndivided the state into violent parties. It seems the proprietors of Eest\r\nJersey expected the _north station point on Delaware_ would hav been\r\nfixed az high az _forty one degrees forty minutes_, the point described\r\nby the original grant from the duke of York. This would hav carried the\r\nlimit of the state about eighteen miles further north on the Delaware\r\nside. Now there iz a bend in the Delaware, at the forks, so that the\r\nstation point az now fixed, iz carried further eest than it would be,\r\nhad it been fixed in _forty one degrees forty minutes_; so the decision\r\nof the commissioners waz in favor of the West Jersey proprietors. From\r\nthe forks, the river bends its course westerly of north, and from a\r\npoint eighteen miles north, a line to Little Egg Harbor, would leev an\r\nangle containing several thousand akers of land, in Eest Jersey. This iz\r\na short state of the origin and progress of a controversy, which stil\r\nagitates the state and disturbs the peece of their guvernment; the\r\njealousies between Eest and West Jersey being almost az great az between\r\nthe northern and suthern states, upon a question respecting the seet of\r\nguvernment, or any other matter of little consequence to the union. The\r\ncontest however iz of magnitude to both parties in New Jersey, az the\r\nlands in dispute hav been settled upon doutful titles; and altho an act\r\nof the legislature may establish theze, yet the loozing party wil expect\r\na compensation.[158]\r\n\r\n    [158] The foregoing facts are taken from Leaming and Spicer's\r\n    Collection; a concise view of the controversy, &c. published\r\n    in 1785; and from the acts of the legislature of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of New Jersey iz almost wholly carried on thro New York and\r\nPhiladelphia. Its situation, between two large commercial towns,\r\nresembles that of Connecticut; but in one respect, the latter haz the\r\nadvantage, viz. that of a butiful navigable river, penetrating the state\r\nand affording the best conveniences for a trade to the West Indies. The\r\nlegislature of New Jersey hav attempted to call home the trade of the\r\nstate, by holding out liberal encouragement for direct importations from\r\nabroad, and making free ports. Perth Amboy affords a fine harbor, but it\r\niz difficult, perhaps impossible, to raize a rival in the naborhood of\r\nNew York. New Jersey and Connecticut wil find their interest in\r\nencuraging manufactures.\r\n\r\nPensylvania waz settled by a religious sect, remarkable for their\r\nsobriety, industry and pacific disposition. Mr. Penn, the first\r\nproprietor of the province, waz a man of superior talents. The free\r\nindulgence given to all religious denominations, invited settlers from\r\nEngland, Germany and Ireland, and the population of the province, with\r\nthe consequential increese of the valu of lands, waz rapid beyond any\r\nthing known in the other colonies. The province however waz harrassed\r\nwith disputes between the acting guvernors and the commons. The\r\nproprietary, who waz the guvernor, usually rezided in England;\r\nappointing a deputy with a council, to act for him in the province. The\r\nproprietaries were often selfish, and made demands upon the peeple,\r\nwhich their sense of liberty and right would not permit them to grant.\r\nThe quit-rents, paper currency, and some other matters, were constant\r\nsubjects of altercation, whenever the assembly convened.[159]\r\n\r\n    [159] See Dr. Franklins Review of the guvernment of\r\n    Pensylvania.\r\n\r\nThe long and violent opposition to the influence of their proprietaries,\r\nwho were abroad, and often considered az hostile to popular privileges,\r\ntogether with the beneficial effects of a paper currency, during the\r\ninfant state of the province, may be the reezons why the constitution of\r\nPensylvania, formed at the revolution, verged too much towards an\r\nextreme of democracy;[160] and why the legislature of that state waz the\r\nfirst to issue a paper currency, after the war. The old republican\r\npatriots, who had resisted, with success, the encroachments of arbitrary\r\nguvernors and kings, determined to frame a constitution, which should\r\nprevent the interference of a guvernor and council in acts of\r\nlegislation; and men who had seen the _good_ effects of paper currency,\r\nwithout its _evils_, would be the first to recommend it. It iz natural;\r\nmen are guverned by habit.\r\n\r\n    [160] The powers of legislation by the late constitution,\r\n    were designed to be vested in the peeple; but in fact were\r\n    vested no where. The pretended legislature consisted of but\r\n    one house; and no bill, except on pressing occasions, could\r\n    be passed into a law, until it had been published for the\r\n    assent of the peeple.\r\n\r\nAt the revolution in 1776, the representativs of the province, acting on\r\nthe principle that public good transcends all considerations of\r\nindividual right, assumed the reigns of government, formed a\r\nconstitution for the purpose, and divested the proprietaries of both\r\nterritory and jurisdiction. They gave them however, 130,000l. sterling\r\nin lieu of all quit-rents, and rezerved to them considerable tracts of\r\nland. The first constitution, like that of the Netherlands, waz framed\r\nupon the ruins of oppression, and with a too jealous attention to\r\npopular rights. It waz defectiv in the most material articles, and a few\r\nyeers experience induced the peeple to adopt another form, more\r\nanalogous to thoze by which her sister states are guverned.\r\n\r\nThe laws of Pensylvania, respecting inheritances, hav not barred\r\nentails; but az entails may be docked by the English finesse of common\r\nrecoveries; az the divisions of lands favor equality, az wel az the\r\ngenius of the peeple, there can be no apprehensions of an aristocratical\r\ninfluence from large possessions of real estate. A single man may hold\r\nreal or personal estate to such an amount, az to hav an undu influence\r\nin politics and commerce. When a man haz become so powerful that hiz\r\nnabors are afraid to demand their rights of him in a legal way; or when\r\na town or city iz so far under hiz control, that the citizens are\r\ngenerally afraid of offending him, he iz or may be a dangerous man in a\r\nfree state, and a _bad_ man in any state. A Clive and a Hastings are az\r\ndangerous in a state, az an Arnold or a Shays, if they hav the same evil\r\npropensities; for thoze who oppoze law, are generally punished; but\r\nthoze who are abuv law, may do injustice with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe peeple in Pensylvania may be included under the three denominations\r\nof _Frends_, _Germans_, and _Irish desendants_. The _Frends_ and\r\n_Germans_ were the first settlers, and for the most part liv between the\r\nDelaware and Susquehanna. Theze are peeceable and industrious peeple.\r\nThe Irish or their desendants, inhabit the western counties; they are\r\nindustrious, but not so wel informed in general, az the inhabitants of\r\nsome older counties, and at times hav been turbulent citizens. It waz\r\nthe misfortune of this, az of all the suthern states, that no provision\r\nfor public skools waz incorporated into the original fundamental laws.\r\n\r\nWithout such a provision, it iz not possible that a body of freemen\r\nshould hav the reeding necessary to form just notions of liberty and\r\nlaw. This defect wil probably be supplied by the new constitution and\r\nthe future laws of the state. The number of colleges and academies\r\nalreddy founded and endowed, proov the disposition of the legislature to\r\nencurage science. The only difficulty iz to persuade an agricultural\r\npeeple to settle in villages or clans, for the purpose of maintaining a\r\nclergyman and skoolmaster; and thus to carry into effect the wise and\r\nbenevolent designs of their rulers.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia iz a great commercial city; but it iz questioned whether\r\ncommerce wil giv it a future growth equal to that of New York. The\r\nfuture population of the suthern part of New Jersey, and the peninsula\r\nbetween the Chesapeek and the Atlantic, wil not add much to the trade of\r\nPhiladelphia. The naborhood of the city and most of the lands towards\r\nLancaster and Bethlehem, are alreddy wel settled. About seventy three\r\nmiles west of Philadelphia runs the Susquehanna; a river not indeed\r\nnavigable at the mouth, but with some portages, capable of opening a\r\ncommunication by water from Wioming to the Chesapeek; and should canals\r\nbe opened to avoid the falls and rapids, the trade of the state, quite\r\nto the bed of that river, wil center in Baltimore. At any rate Baltimore\r\nand Alexandria wil command most of the trade west of the Susquehanna; so\r\nthat Philadelphia must depend mostly, for the increese of her business,\r\non the population northward, about the hed of the Deleware. The commerce\r\nhowever wil always be considerable, and the spirit of the citizens in\r\nestablishing manufactures, promises a great extension of the city.\r\n\r\nThe state of Pensylvania waz, for many yeers, agitated by a territorial\r\ncontroversy with Connecticut; the history of which iz breefly this.\r\n\r\nKing James I. in 1620, made a grant to a number of gentlemen, called the\r\n_Plimouth Company_, of all the lands in North America, included between\r\nthe 40th and 48th degrees of latitude, _throughout all the main land\r\nfrom see to see_; except such lands az were then settled by some\r\nChristian prince or state. The only settlements at that time north of\r\nVirginia, were at New York and Albany, on the Hudson.\r\n\r\nIn 1628, a number of gentlemen obtained from the company a grant of\r\nlands, bounded on the north, by a line three miles north of Merrimak\r\nriver, and on the south, by a line three miles south of Charles river,\r\n_throughout the main lands from the Atlantic on the eest, to the South\r\nSee, on the west_. This waz the first grant of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn the yeer 1631, Robert, erl of Warwick, president of the Plimouth\r\ncompany, granted to lord Say and Seal, and lord Brook, all that part of\r\nNew England, extending from Naraganset river, the space of forty leegs\r\non a strait line, neer the see coast, north and south in latitude and\r\nbredth, and in length and longitude of and within all the aforesaid\r\nbredth, _throughout all the main lands from the western Ocean to the\r\nSouth See_. This grant waz confirmed by the charter of Charles II. dated\r\nApril 23, 1662, with a similar description of the territory.\r\n\r\nIn 1664, king Charles II. gave hiz brother a tract of land in America,\r\nthe description of which iz not wholly consistent or intelligible; but\r\none part of the grant interfered with the Connecticut patent, and\r\ndisputes aroze, which were amicably settled by commissioners in 1683;\r\nthe line between Connecticut and New York being fixed at Byram river,\r\nabout twenty miles eest of the Hudson.\r\n\r\nIn 1680, Sir William Penn obtained from the crown a tract of land,\r\nextending from twelv miles north of New Castle, on the Delaware, to the\r\nforty third degree of latitude, and from the Delaware westward five\r\ndegrees of longitude. This grant interfered with the patent of\r\nConnecticut, provided the grant to the guvernor and company of\r\nConnecticut should be extended west of New York, according to the words\r\nof that and the other grants of New England. Mr. Penn took care to gain\r\na just title to hiz patent by bona fide purchases of the Indians, who\r\npossessed the soil. But the question iz, whether he had a right of\r\npre-emption to lands before granted to other men; and whether the king's\r\ngrant to him could be valid, so far az it cuvered lands alredy conveyed\r\nby the crown to a company, which had begun settlements upon the grant.\r\n\r\nThe Pensylvanians contended that, the geografy of this country being\r\nlittle known in England, az all the maps and charts at that time were\r\nimperfect and erroneous, it must hav been owing to an ignorance of the\r\ndistance from the Atlantic to the South See, that the grants were made\r\nto run thro the continent: That Mr. Penn had acquired the best of titles\r\nto the lands in dispute by fair purchase from the nativ proprietors: And\r\nthat Connecticut, by a settlement of her boundary with New York, had\r\nfixed her western limits, and relinquished all claim to lands west of\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nWhile any part of Connecticut, eest of New York, remained unlocated, the\r\ninhabitants suffered their claims westward to lie dormant. But about the\r\nyeer 1750, the whole of this territory waz located, and the peeple began\r\nto think of forming a settlement west of Delaware river. They however\r\nknew that the lands were claimed by Pensylvania, and to remoov all douts\r\naz to the validity of their own title, requested the opinions of the\r\nmost eminent council in England, upon their right by charter to the\r\nlands in question. They receeved for answer, that the grant to the\r\nPlimouth company, did extend to the westward of New York: That the\r\nsettlement of the boundary line between New York and Connecticut, did\r\nnot affect their claims to lands in other parts: And that, the charter\r\nof Connecticut being of a prior date to that of Sir William Penn, there\r\nwaz no ground to contend, that the crown could make an effectual grant\r\nto him of that country which had been so recently granted to others.\r\nThis answer waz so decisiv and cleer in favor of their claim, that they\r\nproceeded to locate and settle the lands on the Susquehanna river,\r\nwithin the latitude of the Connecticut charter. It seems however that a\r\nfew scattering settlements had been made within the same latitude, on\r\nthe opposit side of the river, under Pensylvania locations. The settlers\r\nsoon came to an open quarrel, and both states became interested in the\r\ncontroversy. The dispute however subsided a few yeers during the war,\r\ntil finally both states submitted their claims to the _jurisdiction of\r\nthe territory_, to a federal court, which waz held at Trenton, in\r\nNovember, 1782. The decision of this court waz in favor of Pensylvania,\r\nand Connecticut acquiesced.\r\n\r\nDissatisfied with this decree, the settlers under Connecticut and\r\nindividual claimants, determined to maintain their _right to the soil_,\r\nwhich they had possessed more than twenty five yeers; and to submit this\r\nalso to a federal court. No court however waz ever held for the purpose;\r\nthe claimants not finding any support from the guvernment of\r\nConnecticut. The settlers, amounting to many hundreds, remained upon the\r\nsoil. Pensylvania, by a precipitancy arising out of an imperfect frame\r\nof guvernment, resolved to take possession of the lands, and sent an\r\narmed force for the purpose. This mezure waz rash, especially az the\r\nprincipal settlers had taken the oath of allegiance to that state, and\r\nwere willing, if they could be quieted in their possessions, to becum\r\ngood and peeceable citizens. Tumults followed; the history of which\r\nwould be disagreeable to most reeders. At length, Pensylvania passed a\r\nlaw to quiet thoze who were actual settlers before the decree at\r\nTrenton, in the possession of their farms, amounting to about three\r\nhundred akers eech. The territory waz erected into a county, by the name\r\nof Luzerne, in honor of the French minister of that name. Colonel\r\nPickering waz appointed Prothonotary[161] of the county. This gentleman\r\nhaz suffered much in reconciling parties; but hiz integrity, zeel,\r\nprudence, and indefatigable industry, bid fair to meet with merited\r\nsuccess in quieting disorders and establishing guvernment.\r\n\r\n    [161] Clerk or register.\r\n\r\nIn this controversy, several questions arize. First, What right had the\r\ncrown of England to the lands in North America?\r\n\r\nI answer, the _right of discuvery_. This right, however the law of\r\nnations may hav considered it, does not in fact entitle a prince or\r\nstate to the soil, even of an uninhabited territory; much less, of\r\nlands possessed by any of the human race. It entitles the discuvering\r\nnation to a preference in forming settlements or occupying vacant lands.\r\nAnd this right iz derived rather from the common convenience of nations,\r\nor the necessity of some principle by which to prevent controversy, than\r\nfrom any connection between _discuvery_ and a _title to property_.\r\n\r\nSecondly, What right could the grantees derive from a royal grant of\r\nlands in America?\r\n\r\nI answer, merely a _right of pre-emption_, or a preference in purchasing\r\nthe lands of the proprietors, the nativ Indians.\r\n\r\nThirdly, The guvernor and company of Connecticut, by the prior date of\r\ntheir charter, having the right of pre-emption to all the lands cuvered\r\nby the charter, could Mr. Penn acquire a title to any of the same lands\r\nby pre-emption?\r\n\r\nOn legal principles he certainly could not.\r\n\r\nThe only substantial ground of title which Pensylvania could hav to the\r\ncontroverted lands, waz, that Connecticut, by neglecting to purchase of\r\nthe Indians, might forfit their right of pre-emption, and leev the\r\nterritory open to any purchaser whatever; so that Mr. Penn or hiz heirs\r\nmight acquire a good title by first purchase. Whether Mr. Penn actually\r\nacquired such a title or not, I am not possessed of documents to decide.\r\nThat the first grant of New England actually extended to the Western or\r\nPacific Ocean, cannot be denied; and congress hav admitted the claim, by\r\naccepting from Connecticut a cession of lands west of Pensylvania.\r\nConnecticut however stil holds a tract of one hundred and twenty miles,\r\nwest of that state, which iz now for sale. The state of Massachusetts\r\nhaz a similar claim to lands west of New York state; and the line\r\nbetween the two states haz lately been settled by commissioners. At any\r\nrate, the controversy between Connecticut and Pensylvania waz finally\r\nterminated by the decree of Trenton, and it iz to be wished no future\r\naltercation may disturb the states or individual proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe small state of Delaware resembles Pensylvania in respect to its\r\nhistory and guvernment.\r\n\r\nMaryland waz settled by Roman Catholic emigrants, from England and\r\nIreland, under lord Baltimore. Large grants of land were carved out to\r\nindividuals, and slaves purchased from Africa to cultivate the soil.\r\nSome of the largest estates in America lie in Maryland. The guvernment\r\nwaz formerly in the hands of the proprietary; but the peeple, at the\r\nrevolution, assumed it. Mr. Harford, the natural son of lord Baltimore,\r\ninherited hiz property in Maryland; but being an absentee during the\r\nwar, hiz estates were confiscated, and on petition, the legislature\r\nrefuzed him even the arreerages of rent, du at the commencement of\r\nhostilities.[162]\r\n\r\n    [162] See the proceedings of the legislature of Maryland in\r\n    1785.\r\n\r\nThe present constitution iz in general excellent; and particularly in\r\nthe establishment of an independent senate. In a popular state, nothing\r\ncontributes so much to stability and safety, az an independency and\r\nfirmness in one branch of the legislature. This state however, like its\r\nnabors, iz remarkable for tumultuous elections; a malpractice that haz\r\nexisted from its first settlement; a practice which wil sooner or later\r\nproov fatal to the attempts of merit in obtaining offices, and sap the\r\nfoundation of a free guvernment.\r\n\r\nThe body of the peeple are ignorant. I once saw a copy of instructions\r\ngiven to a representativ by hiz constituents, with more than a hundred\r\nnames subscribed; three fifths of which were marked with a cross,\r\nbecause the men could not write. Two or three colleges, and some\r\nacademies and private skools, constitute the principal meens of\r\ninstruction in this state, and most of theze are of a modern\r\nestablishment. A few large towns only giv good encuragement to skools\r\nand the clergy.\r\n\r\nMaryland continues to receev multitudes of emigrants from Europe, and\r\nmany of them are of the poorest class. From several months rezidence in\r\nMaryland, I am inclined to beleev, there are more vagabonds in\r\nBaltimore and the vicinity, than in all New England. But Maryland must\r\ndecide upon the public benefit derived from this unrestrained admission\r\nof foreigners.\r\n\r\nVirginia waz settled _eight_ yeers before New York, and _fourteen_\r\nbefore New England. This circumstance haz given the state the quaint\r\nappellation of the _ancient dominion_. The divisions of property are\r\nlarge, and the lands cultivated by slaves. Entailments of land were\r\nbarred before the revolution; but real estate iz not liable for det upon\r\nan execution. It appeers strange at first view, that men should exempt\r\ntheir lands from this liability, and at the same time, suffer their\r\npersons to be imprizoned for det: The singularity however iz eezily\r\naccounted for, by their karacteristic attachment to _large estates_, or\r\nrather to the _name_ of possessing them. When a man's consequence and\r\nreputation depend principally on the quantity of land and number of\r\nnegroes _he iz said to possess_, he will not risk both for the sake of\r\nhiz creditors. The passion for the _name of a planter_, absorbs all\r\nother considerations. I waz once present at an entertainment, given by a\r\n_yung planter_ in Virginia, who had _much land_ and _many slaves_. He\r\naroze at two o'clock next morning, pawned hiz knee buckles and some\r\nother articles, gave hiz landlord a note for about sixty dollars, and\r\nrode off without paying hiz hair-dresser. But he waz _said_ to be a man\r\nof property. Many of the planters are indeed nominally rich; but their\r\ndets are not paid. I waz told by wel informed planters, that some whole\r\ncounties in Virginia would hardly sel for the valu of the dets du from\r\nthe inhabitants. The Virginians, it iz tru, owe immense sums to British\r\nmerchants, and the difficulty of paying them might be a principal reezon\r\nfor suspending the collection by law, at the cloze of the war; but that\r\nthe real estates of a whole county would not discharge the dets of it,\r\niz not to be beleeved.\r\n\r\nA large part of the peeple in Virginia hav not the meens of education.\r\nThe dispersed situation of the planters in the suthern states, renders\r\nit impossible for all to hav access to skools. The university of\r\nWilliamsburg, and a few academies in large towns, constitute the\r\nprincipal meens of education in Virginia; and the same remark iz\r\napplicable to all the suthern states. But a small proportion of the\r\nwhite children can reep any advantage from theze institutions. Since the\r\nrevolution, the legislatures of all the suthern states hav shown a\r\ndispozition to giv liberal encuragement to the education of every rank\r\nof citizens; but the local circumstances or habits of the peeple throw\r\ninnumerable obstacles in the way of executing their patriotic designs.\r\nGentlemen of property, reziding on their plantations at a distance from\r\na village, wil sometimes hire a private instructor in their families;\r\nbut theze instructors must be vagabonds, for the most part; az the\r\ngentlemen wil not admit that a _skoolmaster_ can be a _gentleman_; in\r\nconsequence of which opinion, most or all teechers are excluded from\r\ngenteel company. While this iz the case, men of good breeding wil not be\r\nfound to teech their children. An exception must be made of _grammar\r\nmasters_, az they are called; for a man who can teech Latin, they\r\nsuppoze, may be a _decent_ man, and fit for gentlemen's company.\r\n\r\nReligion fares worse in Virginia than education. Before the war, the\r\nepiscopal waz the established religion of the province, and the churches\r\nwere liberally endowed by law. A parish usually contained four churches,\r\nin eech of which a clergyman officiated in rotation, one Sunday in a\r\nmonth. But this greevous burthen waz remooved by the revolution, and\r\ngreat numbers of parishes hav no officiating minister. A motion waz brot\r\nforward in 1785, to make some legal provizion for supporting clergymen;\r\nbut the proposition waz suspended til the next session of the\r\nlegislature. In the meen time a pompous retorical memorial waz\r\ncirculated and subscribed, in oppozition to the mezure. The arguments\r\nuzed against any ecclesiastical establishments were splendid, _liberal_\r\nand efficacious; and at the following session, the legislature passed a\r\ndeclaratory argumentativ resolv against giving religion any\r\nestablishment and protection.[163]\r\n\r\n    [163] Virginia however iz not alone in this mezure. Rhode\r\n    Island formerly took the same steps, and stil adheres to its\r\n    _liberality_.\r\n\r\nWhen men hav thrown off a restraint that iz disagreeable and\r\nunreezonable, it iz to be expected that they wil run into the extreme of\r\nlicentiousness. Yet it iz one of the most difficult problems in the\r\nhistory of theze states, that the liberal and eminently lerned men, who\r\nconduct the guvernment of Virginia, (and many of their leeding karacters\r\nare of this description) should not view the ministers of religion, in\r\nAmerica, az destitute of that odious and tremendous authority over human\r\nconsciences, which waz assumed under the papal hierarky. I can hardly\r\nbeleev a man of reeding and reflection to be serious, when he asserts\r\nthat legislatures hav no right to compel the subject to _contribute to\r\nthe support of clergymen_, because they hav no authority _over men's\r\nconsciences_. Neether clergymen nor human laws hav the leest authority\r\nover the conscience; nor iz any such power implied in a law compelling\r\nevery citizen to contribute annually to the support of a clergyman. But\r\nany sovereign authority may justly command the citizens to establish and\r\nattend religious assemblies, az wel az to meet for the choice of\r\nrepresentativs, or send their children to a skool; powers which were\r\nnever questioned. A man iz not bound in conscience to beleev all the\r\ninstructions of hiz preceptor; nor are the citizens compellable to\r\nbeleev the opinions and decisions of a court of justice; but the\r\nlegislature haz a right to compel every citizen to pay hiz proportion of\r\ntaxes to maintain preceptors and judges. This iz precisely the fact with\r\nrespect to a legal support of clergymen.\r\n\r\nNo man iz bound in law or conscience to beleev all a preecher says; but\r\nthe whole question iz this; are clergymen, az moral instructors, a\r\nbeneficial order of men? Haz their ministration a good effect upon\r\nsociety? If this should be admitted, there iz no more dout of the right\r\nof a legislature to support such men by law, than there iz of their\r\nright of instituting universities or courts of justice. That enormous\r\nerror which seems to be rivetted in popular opinion, _that the functions\r\nof clergymen are of a spiritual and divine nature, and that this order\r\nof men should hav no concern with secular affairs_, haz laid the\r\nfoundation of a separation of interest and influence between the civil\r\nand ecclesiastical orders; haz produced a rivalship az fatal to the\r\npeece of society az war and pestilence, and a prejudice against _all\r\norders_ of preechers, which bids fair to banish the \"gospel of peece\"\r\nfrom some parts of our empire. The Kristian religion, in its purity, iz\r\nthe best institution on erth for softening the ferocious tempers, and\r\nawakening the benevolent affections of men. To this religion, Europe and\r\nAmerica are indetted for half their civilization. There hav been\r\nperiods, when mankind hav suffered from ecclesiastical tyranny; but\r\ninformation iz demolishing all systems of despotism, civil and\r\necclesiastical. And when the clergy themselves leev all rangling about\r\nspeculativ points, which neether they nor philosophers understand, and\r\nconfine themselves to publishing and enforcing the benevolent precepts\r\nof a gospel which breethes nothing but universal luv and peece to all\r\nmankind, they wil remoov the prejudices against their order, they wil be\r\n_really_ the messengers of peece, they wil conciliate affection, and\r\nthus open the harts of men to receev impressions of virtue, they wil\r\nmake men good citizens here, without which they are never prepared to be\r\nmembers of a heavenly society; and finally they wil establish a\r\n_rational moral influence_ over an enlightened peeple, equally fatal to\r\nthe declamation of ranting fanatics, and the pernicious amusement of\r\ngambling at inns and horse-races.\r\n\r\nIn the Carolinas and Georgia, we find the state of property, literature\r\nand religion, resembling that in Virginia and Maryland. Charleston iz\r\nremarkable for its hospitality and good order. But in the states south\r\nof Pensylvania and Delaware, the divisions of property, the habits of\r\nthe peeple, and the dispersed local situation of the planters, are all\r\nunfavorable to improovments of any kind. Men who liv remote from\r\nsociety, surrounded only by slaves, acquire manners singular and often\r\ndisagreeably imperious, ruf and clownish. Urbanity iz acquired only in\r\nsocieties of wel bred peeple. They cannot hav the benefit of skools and\r\nchurches, without which the body of a peeple _cannot_ be wel informed,\r\nand _wil_ not acquire social and virtuous habits. This manner of\r\nsettlement therefore, tho it may be necessary and beneficial to\r\nindividuals, may be considered az highly inauspicious in a yung country,\r\nwhoze constitutions of guvernment are founded on the principle of\r\nequality, and cannot flurish without mildness of manners and a general\r\ndiffusion of knowlege.\r\n\r\nIn the agricultural improovments of the united states, there iz a\r\nremarkable difference, which must hav proceeded principally from the\r\nslavery of the suthern. In Virginia and Maryland, I should question\r\nwhether a tenth of the land iz yet cultivated. In New England, more than\r\nhalf the whole iz cultivated, and in Connecticut, scarcely a tenth\r\nremains in a wild state. Yet Virginia haz been settled longer than New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nI once heerd the _Prezident_ remark, \"that from the northern to the\r\nsuthern states, the agricultural improovments are in an inverse\r\nproportion to the number of slaves.\" This remark, like the actions of\r\nthat illustrious karacter, dezerves to be engraven on monuments of\r\nmarble. Slaves hav no motiv to labor; at leest, none but what iz common\r\nto horses and cattle. They want the only stimulus that unites industry\r\nwith economy, viz. the prospect of a permanent advantage from their\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nIt haz been obzerved in Europe, that land rented on long leeses, iz\r\nbetter cultivated, than that which iz farmed on short leeses. A man who\r\nholds lands in fee, will uze them to the best advantage, for he expects\r\nhiz children wil enjoy the benefit. A man who haz lands on very long\r\nleeses, haz neerly the same motivs to improov them. Tenants for life\r\nwil make the most of lands for themselves; but wil probably leev them in\r\nthe most impoverished condition. Lessees for a yeer hav few motivs to\r\nkeep a farm in good repair; and slaves are the worst cultivaters on\r\nerth, az they hav the leest interest in the fruits of their labor. One\r\nyeman, who iz master of himself and hiz labors, and eets substantial\r\nfood, wil perform the work of four slaves.\r\n\r\nThis iz not the whole evil. Slaves not only produce _less_ than freemen,\r\nbut they waste _more_; every slave, az Dr. Franklin haz remarked in hiz\r\nMiscellaneous wurks, being, from the nature of situation, a _theef_. In\r\naddition to this, wherever slavery exists, a great proportion of\r\ninhabitants are rendered indolent, and indolence iz followed by vices\r\nand dissipation.\r\n\r\nSuppoze twenty thousand men to do no productiv business; what an immense\r\ndifference wil this make in the cultivation of a state and in the annual\r\nincome. In New England every man does some kind of business: In the\r\nsuthern states, the proprietors of large plantations do little or no\r\nbusiness. The reezon why the planters make such a profit on the labor of\r\ntheir slaves iz, that the subsistence of negroes iz not very expensiv.\r\nThe northern yemanry not only require more clothing than the suthern,\r\nbut they liv on expensiv food and drinks. Every man, even the poorest,\r\nmakes use of tee, sugar, spirits, and a multitude of articles, which are\r\nnot consumed by the laborers of any other country.[164]\r\n\r\n    [164] The consumption of beef in New England iz the reezon\r\n    why the exports of that article do not exceed thoze of\r\n    Ireland. Most of the laboring peeple in New England eet meet\r\n    twice a day, and az much az their appetites demand. Suppose\r\n    eech person to eet but six ounces a day on an average, which\r\n    iz a low estimate, and the inhabitants of New England consume\r\n    more than _one hundred million_ pounds of meet, in a yeer. I\r\n    do not know what proportion of this iz beef, but the greatest\r\n    part iz beef and pork, worth _two pence_, and _two pence half\r\n    penny_ a pound. By the best accounts from Ireland, it iz\r\n    probable the inhabitants do not consume a _twentieth part_ of\r\n    the meet, consumed in the northern states, in proportion to\r\n    their numbers. But suppoze they consume a _tenth_; let the\r\n    New England peeple reduce the consumption of meet in the same\r\n    proportion, and they would save _ninety millions_ for\r\n    exportation. This at two pence a pound makes the sum of _two\r\n    million five hundred thousand dollars_, which iz a very\r\n    handsome commercial income. Let the reduction proceed to all\r\n    kinds of food and clothing; let our common peeple liv like\r\n    the poor of Ireland in _all respects_, and they would save\r\n    twice the sum. I would not recommend this to my countrymen; I\r\n    wish them to enjoy good eeting and drinking. But I make theze\r\n    estimates to show them that they never wil hav much _money_;\r\n    for they eet and drink all they ern.\r\n\r\nBut however cheep may be the subsistence of slaves, while every thing iz\r\nleft to a mercenary unprincipled overseer and to lazy negroes, a state\r\nwil never be wel cultivated. In autumn, 1785, a gentleman in Richmond\r\ninformed me he had just carried some manure upon a field _to make an\r\nexperiment for the first time_. This fact wil hardly be beleeved in the\r\nnorthern states. In travelling thro Virginia, from Alexandria to\r\nWilliamsburg, and also to Petersburg, I saw not one mill dam, except\r\nwhat consisted of mere sand, thrown across a streem. The idea of\r\nconstructing dams of timber and planks, laid so az to make an angle of\r\nforty five or fifty degrees with the horizon, that it might gain\r\nstrength and stability in proportion to the pressure of the incumbent\r\nwater, seemed not, at that time, to hav prevailed in Virginia. In a\r\nvariety of particulars, the slow progress of invention in the suthern\r\nstates, waz equally remarkable.\r\n\r\nSlavery iz an evil of the worst kind; this iz generally acknowledged.\r\nBut what remedy can be applied? To liberate the slaves at once would be\r\nmadness; it would ruin both masters and slaves. To liberate them\r\ngradually, and suffer the freed men to liv with the whites, might giv\r\nrise to discord and tumults. Colonization, by a gradual exportation, iz\r\nan expedient that would be safe and effectual, but cannot be put in\r\nexecution. The probability iz, that, in the lapse of time, the blacks\r\nwil all be blended with the whites; the mixed race wil acquire freedom,\r\nand be the predominant part of the inhabitants. This event haz taken\r\nplace in Spanish America, between the nativs and Spaniards; and, to a\r\ngreat degree, in some of the West India islands. The same event iz\r\nrapidly taking place in the suthern states. A propozition waz once made\r\nin the house of delegates, in Virginia, for granting the rights of\r\nfreemen to the free blacks; it waz not carried; but I do not see how any\r\nstate can deny theze rights to blacks that hav the legal qualifications\r\nof property and residence. This privilege once granted, would facilitate\r\nthe intercourse between the whites and blacks, and hasten the abolition\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\nIn the climate of the united states, there are several particulars that\r\ndezerv notice. In the first place, every circumstance in the local\r\nposition of Atlantic America, concurs to render the wether variable.\r\nTheze states extend thro fifteen degrees of latitude, in the temperate\r\nzone; consequently must always experience the extremes of winter and\r\nsummer. Every part of this territory experiences sudden changes of\r\nwether; but the most numerous and violent changes, are between the 36th\r\nand 43d degrees of latitude, on the Atlantic coast. Within this\r\ndistrict, the most frequent variations seem to be in Pensylvania and\r\nMaryland. Four months in the winter season, the wether in Pensylvania,\r\nMaryland and Virginia, resembles the March wether in New England; almost\r\nevery week exhibiting the varieties of cold, heet, frost, snow and rain.\r\nFor two months in the spring, and one in autumn, New England iz expozed\r\nto eesterly winds and rain; except in theze months, the changes of\r\nwether, tho sometimes sudden and violent, are not very frequent. The\r\neesterly winds, which uzually bring rain, ceese about the 20th of May.\r\n\r\nThe variations of wether in the united states, arizing from the latitude\r\nof their situation, are multiplied by their position on the ocean. Water\r\nin an ocean iz of a very uniform temperature; whereas land iz eezily\r\nheeted and cooled. This circumstance creates an incessant contest\r\nbetween heet and cold, on an extensiv see coast; and of course an\r\neverlasting variableness of winds. This iz true in all countries.\r\nAccording to this theory, Atlantic America must always hav a variable\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThe south eest winds from the ocean, falling upon the continent at right\r\nangles with the shore, invariably produce rain; the opposit, or north\r\nwest winds, proceeding from the high lands in the back country,\r\ninvariably produce cold cleer wether. North eest winds, running parallel\r\nwith the shore, produce storms of snow in winter, and long cold storms\r\nof rain in spring and autum. Our most violent gales blow from the north\r\neest. A south westerly wind sometimes brings rain, and when it first\r\nblows in winter, iz chilly; but it soon moderates cold wether, and in\r\nsummer it iz the _gentle zepher_ of the poets.\r\n\r\nIn speeking of winds, it iz necessary to correct a vulgar error. It iz\r\ncommonly said, that north west winds contract their coldness from the\r\nvast lakes in the north west regions of the united states. This iz an\r\nunphilosophical opinion, for water always moderates the temperature of\r\nthe air; and it iz a wel known fact that the large lakes do not freeze\r\nat all; so that if we were to feel the wind immediately after passing\r\nover them, we should find it always temperate. The truth iz, our\r\nwesterly winds come from high mountains and high regions of the\r\natmosphere, which are always cool. The top of the blu ridge, or first\r\nrange of mountains in Virginia, iz about four thousand feet abuv its\r\nbase. The top of the Allegany or middle ridge, which iz the height of\r\nland between the Atlantic and the Missisippi, tho not so far from its\r\nbase, must be much higher in the atmosphere. How far the base of the blu\r\nridge iz abuv the surface of the ocean, haz not been ascertained; but\r\nsuppoze it five thousand feet, and the top of the Allegany, two thousand\r\nfeet abuv the blu ridge, and the greatest elevation of land iz eleven\r\nthousand feet abuv the waters of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe air on the tops of theze mountains iz never heeted to the degree it\r\niz in the low countries. The cold regions of the atmosphere are much\r\nneerer to such hights, than to a vast extended plain. Thus the tops of\r\nmountains are often cuvered with snow, when the land at the feet of\r\nthem, iz fit for plowing. From the regions of air abuv theze mountains,\r\nproceed the serene cold winds which sweep the Atlantic states, purifying\r\nthe atmosphere and bracing the bodies of animals.\r\n\r\nI would just remark here, that the climate of the trans-alleganean\r\ncountry, wil never be expozed to the frequent changes of air and violent\r\ntempests which harrass the inhabitants of the Atlantic shore. The force\r\nand disagreeable effects of eesterly winds from the ocean, are broken by\r\nthe mountains; and the northerly winds wil be tempered by passing over\r\nthe lakes; while the sutherly winds wil be az refreshing in summer az on\r\nthis eestern coast. Theze remarks are now verified by facts; altho by\r\nbeing cleered from forests, the country wil become more expozed to\r\nvariations of wind.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, it iz obzervable that the climate of America grows\r\nmore variable, in proportion to the cultivation of the land. Every\r\nperson obzerves this effect of cleering the lands in the eestern and\r\nmiddle states. The heet in summer, and the cold in winter, are not so\r\nsteddy az formerly, being interrupted by cool rains in summer, and\r\nmoderate wether in winter. Our springs and autums are longer, the former\r\nextending into summer, and the latter into winter. The cause of this\r\nchange iz obvious: By levelling the forests, we lay open the erth to the\r\nsun, and it becumes more impressible with heet and cold. This\r\ncircumstance must multiply changes of wether. The cultivation necessary\r\nto produce this effect, haz proceeded about one hundred miles from the\r\nAtlantic, or perhaps a little farther. But in Vermont and other back\r\nsettlements, the wether iz yet steddy; there being few violent storms,\r\nespecially in winter. The snow falls gently, and lies til spring;\r\nwhereas neer the Atlantic, moderate wether for three or four days, or a\r\nwarm rain, often sweeps away the snow in January or February.\r\n\r\nBut altho the wether iz growing more variable from the cleering of\r\nlands, yet the salutary effects of cultivation are vizible in the\r\nincreesing salubrity of the climate. The agu and fever iz a disorder\r\nthat infests most new settlements. Cultivation wil totally remoov the\r\ncauses of this disorder, from every tract of country, which iz capable\r\nof being drained. Forty yeers ago, this diseese prevailed in the state\r\nof Connecticut, in the same manner it now does in Maryland. But for\r\ntwenty or thirty yeers past, it haz hardly been heerd of in the state.\r\nThere are a few places expozed to the effluvia of marshy grounds, where\r\nthe disorder stil infests the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSome parts of the suthern states can never be drained; the land iz so\r\nlow that the freshes in the rivers, or the tides, are almost constantly\r\ncuvering it with water. Vegetable putrefaction may be considered az\r\nfurnishing the miasmata in any country; and the greatest quantities of\r\nputrid effluvia are exhaled from lands constantly expozed to a flux and\r\nreflux of water.\r\n\r\nBut all countries, except the very mountanous, when first cleered, are\r\ninfested with intermittants. Peeple on the fronteers of New York and\r\nVermont, are trubbled with it, especially in low flat tracts of land.\r\nThe surface of a wilderness iz cuvered with leevs and rotten wood; at\r\nthe same time, it iz moist, the rays of the sun being excluded by the\r\ntrees. Therefore when peeple first settle in a wilderness, they are not\r\nimmediately attacked with intermittents. They must lay open the surface\r\nof the erth to the action of heet and wind; the noxious effluvia then\r\nbegin to rize, and wil infect the air, til the whole surface of the erth\r\niz dry and sweetened by the heet of the sun. The amazing difference in\r\nthe state of a cultivated and uncultivated surface of erth, iz\r\ndemonstrated by the number of small streems of water, which are dried up\r\nby cleering away forests. The quantity of water, falling upon the\r\nsurface, may be the same; but when land iz cuvered with trees and leevs,\r\nit retains the water; when it iz cleered, the water runs off suddenly\r\ninto the large streems. It iz for this reezon that freshes in rivers\r\nhav becume larger, more frequent, sudden and destructiv, than they were\r\nformerly. This fact should be attended to by the settlers in a new\r\ncountry, that they may gard against sudden and extraordinary freshes in\r\nthe erection of mills and bridges.\r\n\r\nIt iz vulgarly suppozed that the wether in summer iz hotter in the\r\nsuthern states than in the northern. This opinion iz not accurate. The\r\ntruth iz, at particular times, the northern states experience a greater\r\ndegree of heet than iz ever known in the suthern. In the summer munths,\r\nthe mercury in Farenheit often rizes, in the middle of the day, much\r\nhigher at Boston, than at Charleston, in South Carolina. Thus in July,\r\n1789, the mercury roze to 90° or upwards no less than six days, and once\r\nto 93°, in the vicinity of Boston; whereas at Charleston, it roze but\r\nonce to 88° during the same munth, and but four days to 87°. Besides the\r\nmeteorological obzervations I hav, were made at Boston, at _one_\r\no'clock, P. M. and in Charleston, at _two_ o'clock, when the heet iz\r\nusually the greatest. In August, the same yeer, the mercury roze at\r\nBoston[165] four days to 90, and once to 95°; but in Charleston, it roze\r\nbut once to 89°. The remark then ought not to be, that the heet at the\r\nsuthward iz _greater_; but that it _continus longer_; that iz, the\r\naggregate quantity of heet in the suthern latitudes, exceeds that in the\r\nnorthern. I hav taken some pains to ascertain the difference, and\r\nomitting decimals, here giv the result of my enquiries.\r\n\r\n    [165] I say Boston, but I beleev the observations to be made\r\n    at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe meen degree of heet for the whole munth of July, 1789, in\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, by Farenheit's thermometer, waz az follows:\r\n\r\n  At  6 o'clock, A. M. 74° }\r\n  At  2 o'clock, P. M. 83  } Total meen of the\r\n  At 10 o'clock, P. M. 77  } month 78.\r\n\r\nFor _AUGUST, 1789_.\r\n\r\n  At  6 o'clock, A. M. 75  }\r\n  At  2 o'clock, P. M. 83  } Total meen 77 neerly.\r\n  At 10 o'clock, P. M. 72  }\r\n\r\nThe meen degree of heet, at Spring-Mill, a few miles from Philadelphia,\r\nfor _July_, waz 74.\r\n\r\nThe meen degree of heet, at Boston, for July, waz\r\n\r\n  At  7 o'clock, A. M. 67 }\r\n  At  1 o'clock, P. M. 80 } Total meen 71° neerly.\r\n  At  9 o'clock, P. M. 67 }\r\n\r\nFor _AUGUST_.\r\n\r\n  At  7 o'clock, A. M. 62 }\r\n  At  1 o'clock, P. M. 77 } Total meen 68 neerly.\r\n  At  9 o'clock, P. M. 66 }\r\n\r\nTheze facts, tho they cannot be the foundation of exact calculations,\r\nbecause the observations were not made at the same hour of the day, and\r\nperhaps the thermometers were not exactly alike or in the same situation\r\naz to heet, the facts I say may stil establish the following conclusion:\r\n\r\nThat tho the middle of the days in summer may be az warm and even warmer\r\nin New England, than in Carolina, yet the nights are much cooler.\r\n\r\nIn July, the meen temperature at Boston, at seven o'clock in the\r\nmorning, waz seven degrees less than at Charleston at six o'clock. At\r\none o'clock, P. M. the meen heet at Boston waz within three degrees of\r\nthe heet in Charleston at two o'clock. At ten o'clock at night, the meen\r\nheet at Charleston, waz ten degrees abuv that at Boston at nine o'clock.\r\nThe meen temperature for the whole month in Charleston, exceeded that in\r\nBoston, seven degrees. Similar remarks may be made of the munth of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nMeen heet at Charleston, for January, 1789.\r\n\r\n  At  7 o'clock, A. M. 50 }\r\n  At  2          P. M. 55 } Total meen 52-1/3.\r\n  At 10          P. M. 52 }\r\n\r\nAt Boston, for the same munth.\r\n\r\n  At  7 o'clock, A. M. 21 }\r\n  At  1          P. M. 29 } Total meen 25 neerly.\r\n  At  9          P. M. 24 }\r\n\r\nMeen heet at Philadelphia, for January, 1789, 30°.\r\n\r\nHere we may remark, that altho the meen heet of New England, in the\r\nsummer munths, approaches within seven, eight, or nine degrees of that\r\nin Charleston, yet in winter, it iz less than _half_ the heet at\r\nCharleston; the meen degree in Boston being twenty five, and in\r\nCharleston, fifty two.\r\n\r\nThe meen temperature in Charleston, for March, 1789, waz about sixty\r\none; and in Boston, for the same munth, a little less than thirty five,\r\nwhich iz more than half. In Pensylvania, the same munth, the meen waz\r\nforty.\r\n\r\nSo far az I am able to calculate on obzervations in my possession, I\r\nfind the aggregate quantity of heet in South Carolina, for a whole yeer,\r\niz to that in New England, az twenty to eleven; yet there are several\r\ndays almost every yeer, when the mercury in New England rizes higher at\r\nnoon than it ever does in Carolina at any time. This may be ascribed to\r\nthe superior length of the days in the northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe heet of the suthern latitude iz suppozed to produce fevers and other\r\nfatal disorders which prevail in the Carolinas and Georgia. But heet iz\r\nnot very often pernicious, unless when operating upon a low, wet, marshy\r\nsurface of earth. All hilly countries are helthy; and the air of the\r\nmountanous parts of Carolina, two or three hundred miles from the see,\r\niz in general salubrious. But the marsh-effluvia iz not the only cause\r\nof diseese; bad water iz a cause that should be mentioned, and this\r\nabounds in a flat country; whereas the water on hills and mountains iz\r\ngenerally pure. In a great number of towns to the suthward of the\r\nDelaware, and in some to the northward, the want of good water iz a\r\ncapital inconvenience.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the climate of America iz az salubrious, az that of any\r\ncountry in the same state of cultivation. The European naturalists,\r\nwith more spleen than knowlege, hav condemned the climate of America, az\r\nunfavorable to animal growth and perfection; but if their ideas are\r\nfounded on facts, the facts must be taken from the naborhood of an\r\nIndigo plantation. America, like all new countries, haz been expozed to\r\ncertain annual epidemic disorders; but wherever the surface of the erth\r\nhaz been, for a few yeers, cultivated, theze disorders hav ceesed to\r\nrage. I am confident that Connecticut, the most cultivated state in the\r\nunion, iz now az helthy az the south of France. I am confident that the\r\ninhabitants enjoy az general helth, and liv az long. Az to size, no part\r\nof the world can boast of larger and more robust men than the northern\r\nstates. If I mistake not, the English estimate the meen hight of their\r\nmen to be _five feet, seven inches_; but I am confident the average\r\nhight of the men in New England, iz not less than _five feet nine, or\r\nten inches_.\r\n\r\nI could wish to ascertain the difference in the weight of the atmosphere\r\nat Boston and Charleston; but hav no obzervations on the barometer from\r\nthe latter place. The difference between the weight at Boston and\r\nPhiladelphia, upon an average of thirty days, appeers to be very\r\ntrifling, altho at any given day or hour, it may be considerable.\r\n\r\nThere are some curious facts respecting the coast of North America,\r\nwhich dezerve notis.\r\n\r\nThe Missisippi iz a river of great length, running from the high\r\nnorthern latitudes, in neerly a south direction. It iz deep and rapid.\r\nIt resembles the Nile in Africa, particularly in making land where it iz\r\ndischarged into the ocean. By the most accurate obzervations of Mr.\r\nHuchins and others, the distance from the Balize to New Orleans, iz\r\nsomething more than two hundred miles, the whole of which iz land formed\r\nby the discharge of the river. The Nile, in the time of Herodotus, had\r\nformed considerable ilands, which were then inhabited. Theze ilands stil\r\nexist, between the several channels by which that river iz discharged.\r\nIt iz probable, that by an accurate calculation of the desent of the\r\nwaters of the Missisippi, in certain places, taking into account the\r\nmost rapid and most moderate flow, and ascertaining the distance of the\r\nmouth from the most northerly sources, we might find, to a tolerable\r\ndegree of accuracy, the elevation of the land at the sources of that\r\nriver, abuv the level of the ocean.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it wil be found that the mountains and lands at the north west,\r\nare much higher in America than in the north of Europe. Iz not this\r\nprobable from the hight of the Allegany, and the rapidity of the river\r\nMissisippi? And would not the fact, if prooved, in conjunction with\r\nother causes, which are wel known, fully account for the superior degree\r\nof cold in America under the same parallels? It iz wel known that there\r\nare no considerable mountains to the north eest of Great Britain, thro\r\nDenmark, Sweden and Russia.\r\n\r\nOn the Atlantic shore of America, the Gulf Streem iz a curious\r\nphenomenon. It iz however wel accounted for, on the suppozition that the\r\ntrade winds drive the waters of the ocean westward into the spacious\r\ngulf of Mexico, where meeting the continent, they are forced between the\r\nBahama ilans and the coast of Florida, and take their direction along\r\nthe shore of the united states. Such an immense body of waters, flowing\r\nat the rate of three miles an hour, must produce innumerable currents\r\nneer the shore; for every point of land wil occasion an eddy, which wil\r\nbe in proportion to the extent of the point or cape from main coast.\r\nHence the variety of currents, in all directions, between the streem and\r\nthe American coast, which are obzerved by our seemen.\r\n\r\nTheze currents and eddies, at the same time _produce_ and _add to_, the\r\npoints of land shooting into the ocean. The cape of Florida iz probably\r\nproduced between a vast eddy of waters in the Mexican gulf, and the\r\nstreem which flows between the shore and Bahamas. For theory indicates\r\nthat the principal body of water, carried along the Spanish main, or\r\nbetween that and the West India ilans, must be forced to bend its course\r\non the Mexican shore, and by the coast of West Florida, be thrown into a\r\ncircular motion, so az to form a vast eddy to the suthward and westward\r\nof Eest Florida. Where this iz met by the streem, a point of land must\r\nnecessarily be formed.\r\n\r\nIt iz not improbable that Cape Roman, Cape Fear, Cape Hatteras, and Cape\r\nCod, may be formed by similar currents, within the main Gulf Streem. A\r\nconsiderable extent of land on the coast of Carolina and Georgia,\r\nappeers to be made by the washing down of sand from the high country,\r\nand the washing up of sand by the Atlantic, whoze surges almost\r\nincessantly beet the shore. But this alone wil not account for the\r\nextension of points of sand, ten, fifteen or twenty leegs into the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nIt iz a fact that capes and promontories are more frequently harrassed\r\nwith tempests, lightning and thunder, than other parts of the shore or\r\ncontinent. This haz been remarked of New York and Cape Hatteras. Can a\r\nphilosophical reezon be assigned for this phenomenon? Perhaps there may\r\nbe some attractiv power in land thus situated; and perhaps tempests are\r\ngenerated by the agitation of the air, produced by a flux and reflux of\r\nwater, or a variety of opposit currents. A storm hangs over Cape\r\nHatteras, every day, for a considerable part of the yeer. I hav been\r\nwitness to the fact, for a number of days in succession. This\r\ncircumstance increeses the terror of navigating that coast; otherwize so\r\nformidable to seemen for shoals and breakers.[166]\r\n\r\n    [166] I once passed the cape at _five_ or _six leegs_ from\r\n    the breakers, and found but seven fathoms of water.\r\n\r\nIn examining the harbors of North America, we find most of them prezent\r\na channel or entrance neerly at right angles with the shore. The\r\nentrance into most of them iz between the points of west and north. The\r\nentrance into Newport, iz the safest in America, and this iz almost the\r\nonly harbor in the united states which can be made with a northwesterly\r\nwind. This circumstance iz highly favorable to ships coming upon the\r\ncoast in winter. This harbor iz capacious enough to admit all the navees\r\nin Europe, and, if defensible, may be the proper Portsmouth of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXVIII.\r\n\r\n_The following iz part of an \"Essay on the Dets of the United States,\"\r\nwritten in 1787, but never before published. The question haz been ably\r\ndiscussed in Congress, and the proposition for a discrimination between\r\noriginal and purchasing holders of certificates, which I had started,\r\nwithout the prospect of support, haz been maintained by very powerful\r\narguments in our federal legislature. Az the question now appeers to my\r\nmind, I should vote against the proposition, yet merely on the ground\r\nthat from the manner in which the certificates were issued, it iz\r\nimpossible to discriminate, without multiplying the instances of\r\nhardship and injustice. But I hav no more dout, that legislatures hav a\r\nright to interfere, in certain extreme cases, and suspend or counteract\r\nthe operation of legal principles, than I hav of any reveeled truth or\r\nintuitiv proposition; and were it possible to ascertain the original\r\nholders of certificates, I conceev our legislators could not hav\r\nneglected a provision for their losses, without violating their oaths,\r\nthe constitution and public faith. The following extract iz published,\r\nbecause I am desirous my opinion on this subject should be known and\r\nrecorded._\r\n\r\nHARTFORD, MARCH, 1790.\r\n\r\n_On a_ DISCRIMINATION _between the_ ORIGINAL HOLDERS _and the_\r\nPURCHASERS _of the_ CERTIFICATES _of the_ UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTION 1. It iz said that _public faith_ requires the payment of the\r\ncertificates, according to contract; that iz, to the bearers. Let me ask\r\nthe men who contend for promise, what they meen by _public faith_? Did\r\nthe public ever promise to do rong? The money waz du to men who erned\r\nit; the money waz not paid. The full valu expressed on the certificates\r\nwaz du, and the certificates were worth but a fourth, or perhaps an\r\neighth part of that valu. The public promised the creditors their full\r\ndemands; but theze promises, at the time of issuing the certificates,\r\nwere actually worth but a small part of that demand. Ought the creditors\r\nto be dismissed with this part of their money, and then compelled to pay\r\nthe full valu of the certificates to their nabors, who purchased them at\r\ntheir current price? If this iz right, my ideas of justice are _rong_.\r\nPublic faith iz suppozed to be founded on justice. The public engaged to\r\ndo justice to its creditors; but this justice _haz_ not been done; and\r\nit appeers to me az plain az the shining of the sun, that if the\r\ncertificates should be paid to the bearers, justice _wil_ not be done.\r\nThe creditors at the time of contract, expected to receev gold and\r\nsilver, or something equivalent; they hav receeved neether the one nor\r\nthe other. They receeved articles which were worth but a fourth part of\r\ntheir demands; for the remainder of their money, the public iz stil\r\ntheir detor. Public faith therefore requires, that the full valu of the\r\nalienated certificates should not be paid to the bearer. It appeers to\r\nme that the principles of equity, rather than of law, should decide this\r\nimportant question. It iz the design of the contract, not the words,\r\nwhich should be pursued; for it must be remembered, that the design of\r\nthe public haz been counteracted. The intention of the public, expressed\r\non the certificates, haz been defeated by the public exigences; and to\r\npursue the words of the engagement, wil now produce an effect which waz\r\nnot designed, viz. _extensiv injustice_.\r\n\r\nIn this situation the public haz an undouted right to call in the\r\nevidences of the det, and form a system that shall be effectual in the\r\ndistribution of justice. If the public suppoze that any arrangement for\r\nthis purpoze can be made, they certainly hav a right to attempt it; for\r\nthe object of the attempt would be public justice. The sticklers for\r\npaying the det to the present holders, hav the same object in view,\r\n_national faith_; but their ideas of this faith, seem to be derived from\r\nthe practice of other nations, the situation of whoze dets bears very\r\nlittle analogy to that of ours. They therefore advance an argument\r\nagainst their own cauze; for the faith of the public iz prezerved by\r\nfulfilling _the intention_, rather than the _words_, of the contract.\r\n\r\nEvery dollar of old continental currency, promises a Spanish milled\r\ndollar. This promise waz founded on the supposition that the valu would\r\nbe neerly the same, or waz designed to prezerve the valu. But the\r\ndepreciation of that currency, by the enormous sums in circulation,\r\nrendered the fulfilment of the promise impracticable; and had it been\r\nattempted, it would hav thrown the united states into confusion. The\r\nredemption of the bills, at their nominal valu, would hav done justice\r\nto a few, whoze money had depreciated in their hands, but would hav\r\nruined fifty times the number. Thoze who lost their property by\r\ncontinental bills, ought to be indemnified, if the persons and sums lost\r\ncould be ascertained; but this iz impossible. The case of the\r\ncertificates iz different. Theze are promissory notes, expressing the\r\nsums du, and the persons names to whom they were given. If in some\r\ninstances the purchasers hav returned alienated certificates to the\r\noffice, and taken out new ones in their own names, stil the public books\r\nmay remedy this inconvenience.\r\n\r\n2. But it iz said the creditors of the public parted with their\r\ncertificates voluntarily. It waz at their own option, whether to keep\r\nthem or not; and if they choze to alienate them at a discount, the\r\npublic iz not responsible for the loss. _A_ owes _B_ 100l. he cannot\r\nmake immediate payment, but haz property to secure _B_, who takes a\r\npromissory note. _B_ wants the money, and rather than wait for _A_'s\r\nability to pay it, he assigns the note to _C_ for 50l. In this case, _A_\r\ncannot refuse to pay the full sum of 100l. because _C_ gave but fifty\r\nfor the note. This reezoning iz applied to the case of the public det;\r\nand yet a skool boy ought to be ashamed of the application. The case iz\r\nnot parrallel, and the reezoning iz defectiv and inapplicable in every\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, it iz not tru that the alienation of the certificates\r\nwaz a voluntary act; but in most cases, waz an act of necessity. Most of\r\nthe original creditors were ether _rich_ men who loaned money, or poor\r\nmen who did personal service. In many instances, thoze who loaned money,\r\nloaned all their estates; and when they found no provizion made for\r\npaying the interest, or when the interest waz paid in paper of less valu\r\nthan specie, they were left destitute of the meens of subsistence. Some\r\nof theze hav been obliged to part with their certificates at a great\r\nloss. But a large number of creditors were poor peeple, who had little\r\nor no property, but their certificates, who had performed service, and\r\nwere under a necessity of negociating them on az good terms az they\r\ncould. Most of the alienations hav therefore been a necessary\r\nconsequence of public delinquency. Many of the creditors hav experienced\r\na degree of distress, which, in a court of chancery, would entitle them\r\nto a consideration and redress. When a number of losses iz so great az\r\nto effect the public, the legislature then becumes a court of equity,\r\nwhere the sufferers must seek reparation. The legal principle must be\r\nsuspended, and special provision made for this particular case. Thoze\r\ncreditors who were able to keep their certificates, hav generally done\r\nit, and on every principle are entitled to the full nominal valu.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the case of an individual assignee of a bond wil\r\nnot apply; for _B_, in the suppozition, takes the bond voluntarily. _A_,\r\nthe dettor, haz property, and it iz optional with _B_, whether to bring\r\na suit for the money, recover a judgement, and take _A's_ property, or\r\ntake a bond on interest. This iz generally the case with individuals,\r\nbut not with the public creditors. Theze hav no alternativ; they must\r\ntake promises, which the subject cannot compel the public to fulfil,\r\nwhen the money iz wanted. In another particular, the two cases are\r\nwidely different. _A_, _B_, and _C_, are three distinct persons. _A_ iz\r\nthe dettor, and it iz indifferent whether he pays the det to _B_ or _C_.\r\nBut when _B_ haz sold the note for half the valu, he cannot be called\r\nupon for the money, nor for any part of it. In the other case, the\r\ncreditors and the public are, in some mezure, the same person. The same\r\npersons who looze their property by public delinquency, are afterwards\r\ntaxed to pay their proportion to the purchasers. But I wil for a moment\r\nsuppoze the two cases exactly similar; for I am willing to giv my\r\nantagonists the fairest field of argument; and what conclusion can be\r\ndrawn in favor of paying the certificates to the bearers? Can that\r\nreezoning be just which draws general consequences from particular\r\npropozitions? Such bad logic ought not to impeech a man's heart; but it\r\ncan do very little honor to hiz head.\r\n\r\nDo men, who reezon in this manner, consider that a principle with\r\nrespect to individuals, may be perfectly _just_, and yet pursued to a\r\ncertain degree, it may become entirely false? That the same principle\r\nwhich may be good in a certain degree, may, in the extreme becume\r\ncriminal, iz tru not only in politics, but in the natural and moral\r\nsystems. Heet and water, prouduce vegetables; but too large portions of\r\neither, destroy plants. Every passion, natural to man, iz good in\r\nitself, and the wurk of a perfectly wise being; but any passion indulged\r\nto a certain degree, becumes criminal and destructiv to social\r\nhappiness. Self-love, the spring of all action, and in the tru sense of\r\nthe word, the most necessary principle in creation, when it becumes\r\nexcessiv, iz az criminal and pernicious, az the most malignant passion.\r\nEeting and sleeping are essential to helth; but beyond a certain degree,\r\nthey are hurtful, and may be fatal to the human body.\r\n\r\nIn politices, the greatest possible good iz the end of guvernment. Any\r\nprinciple, which may be tru, in particular instances, but which, when\r\nextended to the public, does not produce the greatest good to society,\r\niz certainly false in legislation. A law which may be good and necessary\r\nin a community, may stil bear hard upon individuals. This iz generally\r\ntru of all laws. If a man takes a note of another, and sells it for half\r\nits valu, he haz no remedy in law, nor ought the law to make provision\r\nfor hiz case; for laws are, in their nature and use, general; they do\r\nnot desend to particular cases. The reezon iz obvious. Were laws to\r\nnotice every inconvenience, which may flow from their operation, they\r\nwould produce confusion rather than order, and occasion greater injuries\r\nto the public, than would result from the losses of individuals. But\r\nwhen such particular losses becume general, the principle loozes its\r\nforce. Sufferings, multiplied to a certain number, becume public, and\r\nthen require the interference of the legislature. If a man iz in det,\r\nand cannot pay, he iz at the disposal of the law; the law cannot be\r\nsuspended nor relaxed for hiz particular benefit. But when the body of a\r\npeeple becume involved, the public safety requires a suspension or\r\nrelaxation of law. If an individual settles upon land of another man, he\r\niz considered az a trespasser, and iz liable to an ejectment. But let\r\nthirty thousand men settle thus upon land that iz not their own, and a\r\nwize legislature wil confirm them in their possessions. Necessity or\r\ngeneral good, in such cases, suspends the operation of legal right, or\r\nrather changes _private rongs_ into _public right_. Or to express the\r\nidea differently; when evils are increesed and extended to a certain\r\ndegree, it iz better to let them remain, than to risk the application of\r\na violent remedy. Instances of this kind occur so frequently, that it iz\r\nneedless to multiply examples. Nothing betrays greater weekness, than\r\nthe reezoning of peeple, who say, if a principle iz just, it extends to\r\nall cases. I should however be very unhappy to hav such men for my\r\nlegislators. It may be asked, where iz the line of distinction? I\r\nanswer, it may be impossible to determin. Where the _right_ ends, and\r\nthe _rong_ begins; where the legal principle should ceese to operate,\r\nand special legislativ interference becumes necessary, it may be\r\ndifficult to discuver; but the extreme iz always obvious. Whenever the\r\noperation of a receeved maxim or principle givs general uneasiness, it\r\niz a demonstrativ proof that it iz rong: that it produces public evil;\r\nand a wize legislator wil restrain the operation, or establish a\r\ndifferent principle: On the suppozition therefore that the present\r\nholders of the public det, are precisely in the situation of the\r\nassignees of bonds, stil the principle wil not apply nor warrant the\r\nsame conclusion in both cases; becauze we cannot reezon from particulars\r\nto generals, especially on political subjects.\r\n\r\nSuppoze the original creditors to be five, and the present holders two;\r\nmore than half the number of creditors hav lost the money which waz due\r\nto them; the loss affects them in the first instance, and the hevy taxes\r\nwhich are necessary to appreciate the certificates in other hands,\r\ndouble their injuries and complaints. Theze loozing creditors hav an\r\nidea that they are really cheeted, and their murmurs foment that popular\r\njealousy which iz ever bizzy to check large and sudden revolutions of\r\nproperty. The certificates fall into the hands of rich men, at a great\r\ndiscount, and the body of the peeple say, \"we wil not suffer our own\r\nlosses to enrich our welthy nabors.\"\r\n\r\nThis outcry, it iz said, proceeds from a levelling principle, which aims\r\nto destroy all distinction of rank and property. But in the present\r\ncase, the popular complaints proceed from equitable principles; nor do I\r\nknow of any instance of public jelousy, excited by an acquizition of\r\nproperty in the course of honest industry. Fortunes may be suddenly\r\nraized in private business, by commercial speculations, and no notice\r\ntaken of the event; but when public delinquency haz thrown numberless\r\nadvantages into the hands of a particular class of men, which the peeple\r\nknow are made at their own expense, it iz impossible that they should\r\nbehold such a change of property, without questioning the propriety of\r\nit, and the justness of the principle by which it iz defended. When the\r\ncommon sense of mankind iz oppozed to such a change, it ought to be\r\nconsidered az a good proof that it iz not just.\r\n\r\nWhatever conclusions therefore may be drawn from a principle,\r\nestablished in _courts_ of _law_, or among nations in different\r\ncircumstances, the public sense of justice must, after all, decide the\r\nquestion. A lawyer may wurk himself up to convictions, in wire-drawing\r\nprinciples; but hiz reezoning iz oppozed to the sense of mankind. Peeple\r\nmay not be able to _discuver_ the fallacy of the reezoning, but they can\r\n_feel_ it. They may be _silenced_, but cannot be _convinced_.\r\n\r\nOne grain of common sense iz worth a thousand cobweb theories; and\r\nhowever peeple may be abuzed for refining upon justice, we rarely find\r\nthem generally dispozed to do rong.\r\n\r\nThe domestic det of America furnishes a new era in the history of\r\nfinance. We hav no examples to follow; we must pursu some practicable\r\nsystem, with our eyes invariably fixed on public justice. I know it iz\r\nsaid that the original creditors can purchase certificates now, at the\r\nsame or a less price than they took for them. But this iz not strictly\r\ntru. Individuals might purchase at a low rate; but a general demand for\r\nthem would raize their valu much abuv their current valu at any past\r\nperiod: For it should be considered that hitherto the sellers hav been\r\nnumerous, and the purchasers, few; that iz, a full market, with little\r\ndemand for the articles. Reverse the case. Let the sellers becume the\r\npurchasers; the demand would at once raize the valu of the certificates\r\nneerly to the face of them.\r\n\r\nBut if the certificates were to pass at their present low valu, few of\r\nthoze who hav alienated them, could re-purchase; for the same necessity\r\nwhich obliged them to sell at a loss, now prevents their repurchasing.\r\nPeeple hav not grown rich since the revolution; especially thoze who\r\nwere faithful in the service of their country. At any rate it iz to be\r\nwished that the certificates might ceese to circulate az objects of\r\nspeculation. They are a Pandora's box to this country.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole activ specie of the country iz employed in speculation.\r\nLaws prohibiting usury, restrain the loan of money, while the certain\r\nprofits of speculation amount to five or ten times the legal interest.\r\nNo money can be borrowed; no capitals can be raized to encurage\r\nagriculture and manufactures: Lucrativ industry iz checked; land iz sunk\r\nto two thirds of its real valu, and multitudes of industrious peeple are\r\nembarrassed. From such evils, good Lord deliver us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXIX.\r\n\r\n                         HARTFORD, JANUARY, 1790.\r\n\r\n_An_ ADDRESS _to_ YUNG GENTLEMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a time of life when the passions are lively and strong, when the\r\nreezoning powers scarcely begin to be exercised, and the judgement iz\r\nnot yet ripened by experience and obzervation, it iz of infinit\r\nconsequence that yung persons should avail themselves of the advice of\r\ntheir frends. It iz tru that the maxims of old age are sometimes too\r\nrigorous to be relished by the yung; but in general they are to be\r\nvalued az the lessons of infallible experience, and ought to be the\r\nguides of youth. The opinions here offered to your consideration hav not\r\nthe advantage of great age to giv them weight, nor do they claim the\r\nauthority of long experience: But they are formed from _some_\r\nexperience, with much reeding and reflection; and so far az a zeel for\r\nyour welfare and respectability in future life merits your regard, so\r\nfar this address haz a claim to your notis.\r\n\r\nThe first thing recommended to your attention iz, the care of your helth\r\nand the prezervation of your bodily constitution. In no particular iz\r\nthe neglect of parents and guardians more obvious and fatal, than in\r\nsuffering the bodies of their children to grow without care. My remark\r\napplies in particular to thoze who design their children to get a living\r\nwithout manual labor. Let yung persons then attend to facts, which are\r\nalways before their eyes.\r\n\r\nNature seldom fails to giv both sexes the materials of a good\r\nconstitution; that iz, a body complete in all its parts. But it depends\r\nmostly on persons themselves to manage theze materials, so az to giv\r\nthem strength and solidity.\r\n\r\nThe most criticcal period of life, in this respect, iz the age of\r\npuberty, which iz usually between thirteen and seventeen, or eighteen.\r\nBefore this period, you are very much in the power of parents or\r\nmasters, and if they wish to see you strong and robust, they wil feed\r\nyou with coarse substantial food of eezy digestion. But at fourteen\r\nyeers old, yung persons are capable of exercising their reezon, in some\r\ndegree, and ought to be instructed in the mode of living, best\r\ncalculated to secure helth and long life. It iz obzervable that yung\r\npersons of both sexes grow tall very rapidly about the age of thirteen,\r\nfourteen, fifteen or sixteen; but they do not acquire muscular strength\r\nin du proportion. It should then be the bizziness of yung persons to\r\nassist nature, and strengthen the growing frame by athletic exercises.\r\n\r\nThoze persons who leed a sedentary life, should practis some amusement\r\nwhich requires considerable exertion of the lims; az running, foot ball,\r\nquoit; taking care not to injure themselves by too violent exertion; for\r\nthis would defeet the salutary purpose of such exercizes. But the\r\nexercize I would most recommend, iz _fencing_; for the art itself iz\r\nhighly useful at times, and the practice tends more to render the body\r\nfirm and vigorous than almost any exercize whatever. It braces the\r\nmuscles of the arm, spreds the brest, opens the chest to giv the lungs\r\nplay; an effect of great consequence to persons about the age of\r\npuberty. For, az waz before obzerved, persons of this age, shoot up very\r\nfast; the body grows tall, but narrow; the mass of flesh and blood iz\r\nincreesed much faster than the tone of the vessels and muscular\r\nstrength; the chest iz two narrow for the lungs to perform their office,\r\nand the blood vessels hav not sufficient elasticity to produce a brisk\r\nfree circulation; the system iz often too week to carry on the necessary\r\nsecretions of the juices; and the consequence of the whole iz, an\r\nobstructed circulation produces ulcers upon the lungs, which bring on a\r\ndecay, or some infirmities of body, which last for many yeers, and not\r\nunfrequently for life.\r\n\r\nTo avoid theze ills, much exercise of the arms and body iz not only\r\nuseful, but necessary; and when it iz not the lot of yung persons to\r\nlabor, in agriculture or mekanic arts, some laborious amusement should\r\nbe constantly and daily pursued az a substitute, and none iz preferable\r\nto fencing. A fencing skool iz perhaps az necessary an institution in a\r\ncollege, az a professorship of mathematics; for yung men usually enter\r\ncollege about the age of puberty; and often leev a laborious occupation,\r\nto commence a sedentary life, at the very time when labor or other\r\nexercize iz the most necessary to giv firmness and vigor to their\r\nconstitutions. In consequence of this change and an academic life, they\r\noften run up into long, slender, effeminate bodies, which a slight cold\r\nmay throw into a consumption; or by intense application to books, add,\r\nto a debilitated frame of body, a week nervous system, which keeps them\r\nalways dying, tho it may not end life til old age.\r\n\r\nDancing iz an excellent amusement for yung peeple, especially for thoze\r\nof sedentary occupations. Its excellence consists in exciting a\r\ncheerfulness of the mind, highly essential to helth; in bracing the\r\nmuscles of the body, and in producing copious perspiration. Az the two\r\nfirst effects are very visibly beneficial, they are the subject of\r\ncommon obzervation; but the last, which iz perhaps the most generally\r\nbeneficial, iz rarely mentioned.\r\n\r\nExperience haz led me to the following ideas on this subject. Our bodies\r\nare so constituted that a large portion of the juices should be thrown\r\noff by insensible perspiration; nor can the process be abated without\r\ndanger, nor wholly obstructed without occasioning diseese. The body must\r\nperspire, or must be out of order. A violent cold iz a sudden\r\nobstruction of the process, which throws the matter, intended for\r\nevacuation thro the pores of the skin, back upon the _intestines_,\r\ntaking the word, not in a tecknical, but in its original extended sense.\r\nAll that iz necessary to cure a cold, which iz not attended with\r\nsymptoms of inflamation, iz to open the pores of the body; which may be\r\ndone by bracing, az by drinking cold water, which excites circulation by\r\nits tonic power; or by relaxing the system, az by the warm bath and warm\r\nteas. The first wil answer, where the body haz vigor enough to giv the\r\ntonic its full effect; but iz not so efficacious, nor so generally\r\npracticable az the last. It iz not so eezy to force thro a wall, az to\r\nopen a gate.\r\n\r\nThe common house-wifely remedies, consisting of butter or other oily\r\nsubstances, mixed with spirits, usually hav no effect upon a cold, or a\r\nbad one. Flannel, warm teas, or simple warm water, hav the best effect\r\nin relaxing; but if they fail of producing a perspiration, the patient\r\nshould hav recourse to exercise. Dancing in a warm room, or other\r\nviolent exercise, wil generally throw a person into a copious swet in a\r\nfew minutes; and this, two or three times repeeted, wil usually releev\r\nthe person, however obstinate the cold. If every thing else fails, the\r\nwarm bath should be resorted to az an almost infallible remedy.\r\n\r\nBut there iz another species of obstructed perspiration more dangerous\r\nperhaps than sudden colds, because less perceptible; I meen, that which\r\nproceeds from a week habit of body. Whenever the tone of the vessels iz\r\nlost, the circulation of the blood becumes languid, the animal heet iz\r\ndiminished, and the system haz not strength sufficient to throw off the\r\nperspirable matter. The consequence iz, the skin becumes dry and rigid,\r\nand the person usually feels a dull pain in hiz hed and the back part of\r\nhiz neck. Wimen, literary men, clerks, &c. are most expozed to theze\r\nsymptoms. The remedy for them iz, free perspiration; but the most\r\neffectual remedy iz dancing, or other vigorous exercise, which\r\nincreeses, at the same time, animal heet and the tone of the vessels.\r\nDancing indeed unites to theze, the other advantage of cheerfulness and\r\ngood spirits, which iz of singular use to persons accustomed to close\r\napplication to bizziness or contemplation. The only caution to be\r\nobzerved iz, not to go into the cold air, without considerable\r\nadditional clothing.\r\n\r\nIn cases where persons cannot hav recourse to dancing or other exercize\r\nin a warm room, the warm bath may be uzed to great advantage. At first\r\nthought, one would imagin, that the cold bath should be prescribed for\r\ngiving tone to a week system; but on reflection, this would appeer to be\r\ngenerally, tho not always hazardous. The truth iz, a general relaxation\r\nof the body checks perspiration; and the first effect of cold, in such\r\ncases, iz to brace the exterior parts of the body, and throw the\r\noffending matter, lodged in the skin by the debility of the system, back\r\nupon the lungs, or other interior parts. If the system haz strength\r\nenough, or can receev enough by the operation of cold, to force open the\r\npores and produce a copious perspiration, the cold bath wil hav an\r\nexcellent effect. But when the person iz of a week frame, the experiment\r\niz extremely dangerous. The safest remedy iz the warm bath, which\r\nremooves the obstructing matter by a gentle relaxation of the surface;\r\nthus enabling the vessels to recuver their tone, in a degree, and keep\r\nup a brisk circulation. The warm bath then iz the most safe and\r\nefficacious remedy for obstructed perspiration, occasioned by debility;\r\nand this iz an evil to which all sedentary peeple are expozed, and by\r\nwhich most of them suffer.\r\n\r\nI hav been often suprized that the moderns hav so generally neglected\r\nthe meens of prezerving helth, which were uzed by the ancients. A little\r\nattention to the structure of the human body, and the effect of heet and\r\ncold upon it, led the ancients to the obvious and almost infallable\r\nmeens of garding themselves from diseeze. Their method waz to bathe\r\nalmost daily; and then oil their bodies. By bathing, they kept their\r\nperspiration free, and their bodies of course, in vigor and clenly; and\r\nby the use of oil, they secured the body from the fatal effects of\r\nsudden cold. In the later ages of Rome, warm baths indeed became a\r\nluxury, and were uzed to excess; but this waz only an abuse of a good\r\nthing, the excellent effects of which had been experienced for ages. The\r\nneglect of the same meens, of preventing diseese, haz obliged the\r\nmodern to hav recourse to physic, a substitute, more expensiv and\r\ntrublesome, and not always effectual.[167]\r\n\r\n    [167] It iz evident, from the silence of all ancient\r\n    monuments, that the heeling art waz not cultivated, and\r\n    scarcely known among the old Romans. For several ages from\r\n    the bilding of Rome, there iz hardly any mention made of a\r\n    physician. Pliny relates, that Rome flurished, six hundred\r\n    yeers, without physicians; that iz, the profession waz not\r\n    honorable, being confined to servants or other low karacters.\r\n    In Seneca's time, many of theze had acquired estates by the\r\n    bizziness; but they were stil held in no estimation. \"Bona in\r\n    arte medendi humillimisque quibus contingere videmus.\" After\r\n    the conquest of Greece and Asia, the manners of the Romans\r\n    were corrupted by the luxuries of the eest; diseeses\r\n    multiplied, and the practice of physic became more necessary\r\n    and more reputable; but the art of surgery waz not separated\r\n    from that of medicin, til the times of the emperors.\r\n\r\nWhether in bizziness or amusement, let your whole conduct be guided by\r\ntemperance. Are you students? Eet moderately, and let your food be of\r\nthe nutritiv kind, but not oily, high seesoned and indigestible. Drink\r\nbut little, or rather no distilled liquors; wine and fermented liquors\r\nare much to be preferred. A good cup of tee, iz sometimes a cordial;\r\ncoffee may be uzed freely; but the constant use of hot liquors seldom\r\nfails to debilitate the system and impair the digestiv powers.\r\n\r\nWhether you reed or rite, accustom yourselves to stand at a high desk,\r\nrather than indulge an indolent habit of sitting, which always weekens,\r\nand sometimes disfigures the body. The neerer you can keep every part of\r\nthe body to an eezy strait posture, the more equable wil be the\r\ncirculation of the fluids; and in order to giv them the most\r\nunconstrained flow to the extremities of the lims, it iz very useful to\r\nloosen thoze parts of dress that bind the lims closely.\r\n\r\nThere iz another kind of temperance which I would warmly recommend; that\r\niz, temperance in study. Little does a helthy robust yuth reflect upon\r\nthe delicate texture of the nervous system, which iz immediately\r\naffected by close mental application. The full fed muscular man may\r\nspurn the caution, that warns him against the danger of hypocondriacs;\r\nbut it iz next to impossible that the hard student, who clossets himself\r\nseven or eight hours a day, in deep meditation, should escape the\r\ndeplorable evil, which makes men valetudinarians for life, without hope\r\nof a radical cure, and with the wretched consolation of being\r\nperpetually laughed at.\r\n\r\nFour hours of uninterrupted study in a day iz generally sufficient to\r\nfurnish the mind with az many ideas az can be retained, methodized and\r\napplied to practice; and it iz wel if one half of what are run over in\r\nthis time are not lost. It may sometimes be necessary to study or reed\r\n_more_ hours in a day; but it wil az often be found useful to reed\r\n_less_.\r\n\r\nWhen you exercize at any diversion, or go into company, forget your\r\nstudies, and giv up yourselves entirely to the amusement. It wil do you\r\nno good to leev your books behind, unless you dismiss your attention or\r\ntrain of thinking. Attend to experience. You find it very fateeging to\r\nstand, sit or even to lie in one fixed posture, for any length of time,\r\nand change affords releef. The same iz tru of the mind. It iz necessary,\r\nif I may indulge the expression, to change the pozition of the mind;\r\nthat iz, vary the train of thought; for by a variety of ideas, the mind\r\niz releeved, in the same degree az the body by a change of posture.\r\n\r\nWhen you reed, always endevor to reed with some particular object. You\r\nwil find many books that ought to be red in course; but in general when\r\nyou take up a treetis upon any science, or a volum of history, without a\r\nview to inform yourself of some _particular_ in that wurk, you are not\r\nlikely to retain what you reed. The object iz too general; the mind iz\r\nnot capable of embracing the whole. For instance, if you reed Hume's\r\nEngland in course, with design to acquaint yourself with the whole\r\nstory, you wil find, at the end of your labor, that you are able to\r\nrecollect only a few of the most remarkable occurrences; the greatest\r\npart of the history haz escaped you. But if you confine yourself to\r\n_one point of history_ at a time, for example, the life and policy of\r\nAlfred, or the account of Mary, queen of Scots, and reed what every\r\nauthor you can lay your hand on, haz said upon that subject, comparing\r\ntheir different accounts of it, you wil impress the history upon the\r\nmind, so az not to be eezily effaced. Law students should attend to\r\ntheze remarks.\r\n\r\nThere iz another kind of temperance of more consequence than thoze\r\nmentioned, viz. temperance in plezure: For to all the personal evils of\r\nan excessiv indulgence of the animal appetite, we may add innumerable\r\nevils of a moral and social nature. No intercourse should take place\r\nbetween the sexes, til the body haz attained to full strength and\r\nmaturity. In this respect, ancient barbarous nations hav set an example,\r\nthat ought to make moderns blush for their effeminacy of manners, and\r\ntheir juvenile indulgences. The old Germans accounted it shameful and\r\ndisreputable for yung men to hav any intercourse with the other sex,\r\nbefore the age of twenty.[168] To this continence were they much\r\nindetted for their muscular bodies, their helth and longevity. But such\r\nan abstinence from plezure waz not maintained by law; the Germans knew\r\nthat positiv prohibitions would be ineffectual to restrain this\r\nindulgence; they had recourse to the only certain method; they made it\r\n_dishonorable_. How different iz the case in modern times! So far iz\r\ndebauchery from being scandalous, that it iz frequently the boast of men\r\nin the first offices of state; and a karacter of licentiousness iz\r\nlittle or no objection in a candidate for preferment.[169]\r\n\r\n    [168] Qui diutissime impuberes permanserunt, maximam inter\r\n    suos ferunt laudem: Hôc ali staturam, ali vires, nervosque\r\n    confirmari putant. Intra annum vero xx feminæ notitiam\r\n    habuisse, in turpissimis habent rebus.---- Cesar De Bel. Gal.\r\n    lib. 6. 19.\r\n\r\n    [169] The ancients were wiser than the moderns in many\r\n    respects; and particularly in restraining certain vices by\r\n    _opinion_, rather than by _positiv injunctions_. Duelling and\r\n    profane swearing are prohibited by the laws of most\r\n    countries; yet penalties hav no effect in preventing the\r\n    crimes, whilst they are not followed by loss of reputation.\r\n    Vices which do not immediately affect the lives, honor or\r\n    property of men, which are not _mala in se_, which are eezily\r\n    conceeled, or which are supported by a principle of honor or\r\n    reputation, are not restrainable by law. Under some of theze\r\n    description fall, duelling, profane swearing, gambling, &c.\r\n    To check such vices, public opinion must render them\r\n    infamous.[j] Thoze who hav the distribution of honors and\r\n    offices, may restrain theze vices by making the commission of\r\n    them an insuperable bar to preferment. Were the _Prezident_\r\n    and the executivs of the several states, to be az particular\r\n    in enquiring whether candidates for offices are given to\r\n    gambling, swearing or debaucheries; whether they hav ever\r\n    given or receeved a challenge, or betrayed an innocent\r\n    female; az they are in enquiring whether they are men of\r\n    abilities and integrity; and would they, with undeviating\r\n    resolution, proscribe from their favor and their company,\r\n    every man whoze karacter, in theze particulars, iz not\r\n    unimpeechable, they would diminish the number of vices,\r\n    exclude some wholly from society, banish others from genteel\r\n    company, and confine their contagion to the herd of mankind.\r\n    But where iz the man of elevated rank, of great talents, of\r\n    unshaken firmness, of heroic virtue, to begin the glorious\r\n    reformation? America may now furnish the man, but where shall\r\n    hiz successor be found?\r\n\r\n         [j] See Vattels Law of Nations, b. I. ch. 13.\r\n\r\nOppozed to passion and to false pride, caution wil perhaps be\r\nunavailing. But men who wish for permanent happiness, should be\r\npersuaded to take the meens for securing it. Wil you then run the risk\r\nof erly indulgence in illicit plezure? Some of you _may_ escape the\r\nevils which generally follow; but the chances are against you. In nine\r\ncases of ten, you wil destroy the vigor of your bodies, and thus impair\r\nthe ability of enjoyment by excess; or what iz an additional evil, you\r\nwil contract diseese. What iz the consequence? Eether your taste for the\r\nvilest plezures wil grow into habit and make abandoned rakes of you,\r\naverse to the innocent enjoyments of the married life, and of course bad\r\nmembers of society; or you wil perhaps marry amiable wimen, with your\r\nstrength and helth impaired, and your minds debauched, fickle, prone to\r\njelousy. In this case, you are neether secure of your partners\r\naffections, nor wil you be likely to know the valu of their virtues.\r\nHaving broken over the barriers of virtue, you are forever liable to\r\nstray; and the probability iz, you destroy the happiness of your wives,\r\nand the peece of your families. Perhaps with some art, and the forgiving\r\ntemper of your wives, you may conceel the family discord, and the\r\nwretched state of your minds, from a censorious world; pride,\r\nreputation, every motiv would urge you to this precaution; but iz not\r\nthis a poor substitute for happiness? A poor consolation for the\r\nmultiplied evils that follow, in an endless train, from the unreezonable\r\nand criminal indulgences of a few yeers? You may be assured also that a\r\nwoman of good principles cannot feel a pure satisfaction, in the company\r\neven of a reformed husband, when she reflects, az she frequently wil,\r\nthat he haz wasted hiz helth and substance upon the vilest of her sex.\r\nMy yung frends, it iz idle, it iz weekness and folly to expect any kind\r\nof happiness or plezure, which shal indemnify you for the trubble of\r\nseeking it, except in the pursuance of the principles which morality\r\nprescribes. Whenever you pursu an object, at the expense of any moral\r\nprinciple; when the attainment of your end must injure the person, the\r\nproperty, the reputation or the feelings of one child of Adam, the\r\nacquisition of that object wil not giv you happiness; you are pursuing a\r\nfantom. This leeds me to say something on one of the most hanous crimes\r\na man can commit, and which the laws of society cannot or at leest do\r\nnot punish; that iz, seduction.\r\n\r\nFashion, which iz often founded on moral propriety, and oftener on\r\npolitical convenience, iz sometimes an enemy to both; and public\r\nopinion, enlisted in the cauze of vice, iz a greater scurge to society\r\nthan war or pestilence. It iz one of the evils, or rather of the curses\r\nof civilization, that certain crimes, az malignant in their nature, and\r\naz fatal in their consequence, az murder and robbery, becume\r\nfashionable, and to a certain degree, reputable. Of this kind, iz\r\ndeliberate seduction. It iz az malignant in its nature az murder, for\r\nit iz accompanied with the same aggravation, malice pretense, or a\r\npremeditated design: It iz az fatal to society; for reputation iz az\r\ndeer az life; and the wretched victims of deception, if they lay violent\r\nhands on themselves, or linger out a life of disgrace, are equally\r\nmurdered, equally lost to society. And the only reezon why the seducer\r\nand the murderer hav not been placed on a footing by the laws of\r\nsociety, must be, the difficulty of proof, or of ascertaining the\r\ndegrees of gilt, where there iz a possibility or a presumtion of assent\r\non the part of the woman.\r\n\r\nThere are however certain instances of this crime which are az capable\r\nof proof az, arson, burglary or murder; and why the laws of a state,\r\nwhich prohibit under severe penalties, the taking or giving more than\r\nsix per cent. interest on the loan of money, even on the fairest\r\ncontract, should yet permit the seducer to take another's reputation, to\r\ndoom to indelible infamy the helpless female, whoze reputation iz all\r\nher portion, iz one of thoze problems in society, which the philosopher\r\nwil impute to human imperfection, and the Kristian number among the\r\ninscrutable mysteries of providence.\r\n\r\nBut I am not addressing legislators; I am reezoning with individuals.\r\nWaving the baseness of the crime, let us attend to its consequences in\r\nfamilies and society. You wil doutless acknowlege, for I do not see how\r\nyou can deny, that when you deliberately commit a crime that affects\r\nyour nabor, you explicitly admit that your nabor haz an equal right to\r\ncommit the same crime against yourselves; for I presume no man wil\r\narrogate to himself an exclusiv privilege of being a villan.\r\n\r\nYou attempt then to seduce the wife, the sister, or the dawter of your\r\nfrend; but hav you none of theze relations? Hav you not a wife, a\r\nsister, a dawter, whoze reputation iz deer to you; whoze honor you would\r\ndie to defend? You hav attacked the honor of your nabor; haz he not the\r\nsame right to assail your family, in the same delicate point? But if you\r\nhas none of theze neer connections, hav you no female frend whoze\r\nreputation iz deer to you? Now by attempting the honor of any woman, you\r\nwage war with the whole human race; you break down the barriers which\r\nnature and society hav established to gard your _own_ family and frends,\r\nand leev _their_ honor and happiness, and consequently your _own_,\r\nexpozed to the intreegs of every unprincipled retch: You even invite an\r\nattempt upon your family and frends; you beet a challenge, and bid\r\ndefiance to any man who haz the spirit to revenge the rongs of the\r\nhelpless. Theze are serious considerations, in which men of principle\r\nand of no principle are equally interested; for an abandoned rake iz\r\nusually az fond of hiz own and hiz family's honor, az the man of the\r\nchastest life.\r\n\r\nMingle with your superiors in age and wizdom, whenever you can do it\r\nwith propriety. If your parents are wize, they wil associate with you az\r\nmuch az possible in your amusements; they wil be cheerful and facetious,\r\nand thus make you az happy az you wish to be at home. A morose crabbed\r\nold man iz not inviting company for the yung and sprightly; and you\r\nought rather to shun the illnatured, if possible. But whenever your\r\nparents are of a cheerful dispozition, and luv their children, they make\r\nthe most agreeable and most useful companions. They wil find amusements\r\nfor you at home, and you wil be happier there than any where else. If\r\nyour parents are thus dispozed to make themselves your principal\r\ncompanions, always indulge their inclination. You wil thus avoid the\r\ncontagion of vicious company, you wil form a habit of contentment and\r\nsatisfaction at home; and remember, if you do not find happiness there,\r\nyou wil never find much satisfaction abroad.\r\n\r\nIn choosing society however, be careful not to push yourself into\r\ncompany. Yung men are often impatient of the restraints which modesty\r\nand decorum impoze upon them. They are anxious to associate with thoze\r\nof greater age and rank than themselves; and expect more notis than\r\nmankind in general suppoze they dezerv. This proceeds from the ambition\r\nand fire of youth; the motivs I beleev to be often innocent and\r\nlaudable; the ambition therefore should be guverned, rather than\r\nrepressed. A little experience wil dictate patience and a modest\r\ndeportment, which, with yeers and information, wil always ensure\r\nrespectability. I once knew a man of twenty two chagrined even to\r\npetulence, becauze he could not be admitted a trustee of a college. I\r\nwaz surprized at hiz severe remarks on the venerable body of gentlemen\r\nwho rejected him. He thought himself a man of more science than some of\r\nthe corporation; and therefore better qualified to direct a literary\r\ninstitution. Admit the fact, that he excelled in scientific attainments,\r\nyet the vexation he felt at hiz disappointment waz proof enough that he\r\nwaz destitute of the first requisits in the overseers of yuth,\r\n_coolness_ and _judgement_.\r\n\r\nIn the world, avoid every species of affectation, and be az fashionable\r\naz convenience wil warrant. Yet never be the first to invent novelty,\r\nnor run to excess in imitation. This advice, _to be fashionable_, should\r\nhowever be qualified, and restrained to things indifferent, in point of\r\nmorality. Az the moral karacter of men does not depend on the shape of\r\ntheir garments, it iz generally best to wear our clothes in the model\r\nthat fashion prescribes; unless your circumstances forbid, or the\r\nfashion itself iz inconvenient: For if you are not able to afford the\r\nexpense, it iz criminal in you to follow the customs of the welthy; and\r\nif the shape of a garment makes it uneezy upon you or cumbersome, the\r\nfashion iz ridiculous, and none but week peeple, the common coxcombs and\r\nbutterflies of the world, wil adopt it. For this reezon follow lord\r\nChesterfield's maxims with great caution. His letters contain a strange\r\ncompound of the _best_ and _worst_ instructions ever given to a yung\r\nman; indeed it would be expected of a man, whoze object waz not to make\r\nhiz son _good_, but to make him _showy_.\r\n\r\nHiz lordship, I think, recommends to hiz son to wear _long nails_; in\r\nconsequence of which advice, long nails are very fashionable wherever\r\nhiz letters are red. But a man ought to be consistent. Why did he not at\r\nthe same time recommend long beards? Both are very proper among savages,\r\nwho hav no ideas of neetness; and one would think, they should always go\r\ntogether; but among civilized peeple, both are equally slovenly. Hiz\r\nlordship givs an excellent reezon for hiz advice; that mekanics pare\r\ntheir nails, and _gentlemen_ ought to be distinguished from _laborers_.\r\nWhy did not he add, that az mekanics walk on two feet, gentlemen, for\r\nsake of distinction, ought to walk on all fours? But hiz lordship had\r\nbetter reezons for hiz advice. Long nails are a most commodious\r\nsubstitute, or at leest furnish a reddy alleviation of the evils arizing\r\nfrom a sparing use of ivory. Besides, hiz lordship waz a courtier, fond\r\nof royal examples, &c. He found a princely one in the Assyrian monark,\r\nwho, when he waz a beest, wore hiz nails in the same manner.\r\nNebuchadnezzer however waz under the direction of a divine impulse; an\r\nauthority that hiz lordship could not claim for _all_ hiz injunctions\r\nand maxims.\r\n\r\nNever let fashion blind you to convenience and congruity. Do not\r\nintroduce foreign customs, without reezon, or by the halves. The French\r\nfeed themselves with forks, uzing knives merely to cut their meet;\r\ntherefore knives with sharp points, are for them the most convenient.\r\nBut it iz really laughable to see the Americans adopting the use of\r\nsharp pointed knives, without the practice of feeding themselves with\r\nforks. They do not see the particular convenience of the custom in\r\nFrance, where it originated; but it iz _the fashion to uze them_, and\r\nthis iz all they think of. They are however well punished for their\r\nservile apishness, especially when they are hungry; for a man may az wel\r\nfeed himself with a bodkin, az with a knife of the present fashion.\r\n\r\nBe equally careful of affectation in the use of language. Uze words that\r\nare most common and generally understood. Remember that sublimity and\r\nelegance do not consist principally in words; az the modern stile of\r\nwriting would make us beleev. Sublimity consists in grand and elevated\r\nideas; and elegance iz most generally found in a plain, neet, chaste\r\nphraseology. In pronunciation be very cautious of imitating the stage,\r\nwhere indeed nature _should be represented_, but where in fact we find\r\ntoo much strutting, mouthing, rant, and every kind of affectation. The\r\nmodern pronunciation of our language on the English stage iz, beyond\r\nmezure, affected and ridiculous. The change of _t_, _d_ and _s_ into\r\n_ch_, _j_ and _sh_, in such words az _nature_, _education_,\r\n_superstition_, originated in the theatrical mouthing of words; and iz,\r\nin language, what the stage-strut iz in walking. The practice haz indeed\r\nspred from the stage among our polite speekers, who hav adopted it, az\r\npeeple do other fashions, without knowing why. Were it a matter of\r\nindifference, like the shape of a hat, I would recommend it to your\r\nimitation; but I hav cleerly prooved in another place,[170] that the\r\npractice iz not vindicable on any good principles; that on the contrary,\r\nit materially injures the language, both in orthography and the melody\r\nof speeking. There iz such a thing az tru and false taste, and the\r\nlatter az often directs fashion, az the former. The _nachure_ and\r\n_edjucation_ of modern times are to purity of language, what red fethers\r\nand yellow ribbons are to elegance in dress; and could the practice be\r\nrepresented with a pencil, it would be az boldly caricatured, az the\r\nenormous hed-dresses of 1774.\r\n\r\n    [170] See my Dissertations on the English Language, 4.\r\n\r\nDo not adopt such phrases az _averse from_, _agreeably to_, _going\r\npast_, and other modern alterations of the usual idiom; for they are\r\ngross violations of the principles of the language, az might be eezily\r\nprooved, were this the place. If you are a lawyer, do not confound such\r\nterms, az, _witness_, _testimony_ and _evidence_, calling a _witness_,\r\nan _evidence_. _Witness_ iz the person testifying; _testimony_ iz what\r\nhe declares in court; and _evidence_ iz the effect of that testimony in\r\nproducing conviction. Do not confound such words az, _genius_ and\r\n_capacity_, or _sense_, _lerning_ and _knowlege_. _Genius_ iz the power\r\nof _invention_; _capacity_, the power of _receeving_ ideas. _Sense_ iz\r\nthe faculty of perception; _lerning_ iz what iz obtained in _books_;\r\n_knowlege_ iz what iz acquired by _observation_.\r\n\r\nAttach yourselves to bizziness in the erly part of life. Shun idle\r\ndissipated karacters az you would the plague. Listen to nature and\r\nreezon, and draw just ideas of things from theze pure sources; otherwize\r\nyou wil imbibe _fashionable sentiments_, than which a more fatal evil\r\ncannot happen to you. You wil often heer bizziness condemned az drudgery\r\nand disgrace. Despize the sentiment. Nature speeks a different language.\r\nNature tells you, \"that she haz given you bodies, which require constant\r\nexercize; that labor or some other exercize iz essential to helth; that\r\nemployment iz necessary to peece of mind; and industry iz the meens of\r\nacquiring property.\" Nature then haz rendered _bizziness_ necessary to\r\n_helth and happiness_, az wel az to _interest_; and when men neglect her\r\ndictates, they are usually punished with poverty, diseeze and\r\nretchedness. It sometimes happens that a man's ancestors hav accumulated\r\nsuch an estate, that he iz wel secured from _poverty_; but the very\r\nestate he possesses, iz the meens of entailing upon him diseeze and all\r\nits consequential evils: For a rich man iz strongly tempted to be lazy;\r\nand indolence, by debilitating the animal system, destroys the power of\r\nenjoyment. Besides, a man of eezy circumstances iz very apt to looze the\r\nvirtu of self denial; he indulges hiz appetite too freely; he becumes an\r\nepicure in eeting, and perhaps a bakkanalian; he iz then a slave of the\r\nworst kind, a slave to hiz own desires, and hiz faithful services to\r\nhimself are rewarded with the gout.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, he may squander away hiz estate; and then he iz\r\npoor indeed! For a man who iz bred in affluence, seldom haz the\r\nresolution or the knowlege requisit to repair a broken fortune. The way\r\nto _keep an estate_, iz to lern in youth how to _acquire one_; and the\r\nway to _enjoy_ an estate, iz to be constantly in some bizziness which\r\nshal find employment for the faculties of the mind. Idleness and plezure\r\nfateeg az soon az bizziness; and indeed when bizziness haz becume\r\nhabitual, it iz the first of plezures.\r\n\r\nIn forming a matrimonial connection, bridle fancy, and reduce it to the\r\ncontrol of reezon. You wil perhaps be in luv at sixteen; but remember,\r\nyou cannot rely on the continuance of the passion. At this erly period\r\nof life, a man's passions are too violent to last; he iz in raptures and\r\necstacy; but _raptures and ecstacy_ never continu _thro life_. While a\r\nman talks of raptures and paradise on erth, he iz not fit to be married;\r\nfor hiz passion, or rather hiz frenzy, warps hiz judgement; he iz az\r\nunqualified to form a just estimate of a woman's karacter, az a blind\r\nman to judge of colors. The probability iz, in all such cases, that a\r\nman wil make a bad choice; at leest the chances are ten to one against\r\nhim. Before a man marries, he should liv long enuf to experience the\r\nfallacy of hope, and to moderate hiz expectations down to real life. He\r\nwil then meet with fewer disappointments, and be better prepared to\r\nrealize the happiness that iz within hiz power.\r\n\r\nIf you feel a _violent_ passion for a young lady, the chance iz that the\r\nfirst opportunity you hav, you wil discloze it, and assure her you are\r\ndying for her. Should passion hurry you to such a declaration, before\r\nyou hav much acquaintance with her, and before you hav, by your\r\nattentions, made some favorable impressions on her hart, you may be sure\r\nof a repulse; for your sudden professions frighten the lady, and ladies\r\nare never frightened into luv. A widow wil sometimes surrender to the\r\nmost unexpected attack; but yung coy maidens are to be taken only by\r\ngradual approaches. To ensure success, take the advice of a very\r\nsensible woman; \"first be the frend, and then the luver.\" Be polite and\r\nattentiv; show yourself a particular frend, for ladies are not alarmed\r\nat professions of esteem; be neether bashful, nor discuver uncommon\r\nsolicitude; and the lady's hart wil probably be yours before she knows\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDo you ask, how you shal discuver the tru karacter of a woman, so az not\r\nto be deceeved? I answer, this must depend mostly on obzervations of\r\nyour own, or of thoze that are more acquainted with the sex than\r\nyourself. The virtues of good nature, delicacy, modest rezervedness,\r\nprudence, &c. are discuverable only by considerable acquaintance. I\r\nwould however advize you to be cautious of connecting yourselves with\r\nthe following karacters: First, wimen who hav been accustomed to indulge\r\nfamiliarities, even in company, such az kissing, playing with their\r\nhands, and the like. Secondly, thoze who wil never be seen in the\r\nmorning; for if a lady runs out of a room, and avoids you in a morning\r\ndress, the suspicion iz that she iz a slut, and that she iz conscious of\r\nher unfitness to be seen. A neet woman wil never be ashamed of her\r\ndishabille, for in this she wil show her neetness to the best advantage.\r\nA slut may look tolerably wel in silks; but a neet woman only wil appeer\r\nwel in a kitchen or at a brekfast table in her own family.\r\n\r\nThirdly, never connect yourselves with a very loquacious or fretful\r\nwoman; such a partner wil teeze you thro life. Fourthly, avoid one who\r\nhaz a slanderous tung; she wil keep your family and the naborhood in\r\nperpetual discord. Fifthly, form no connection with a woman, who haz no\r\nacquaintance with a kitchen. She wil trust every thing to servants, who\r\nwil waste more than you consume; she wil not know how to reform abuses\r\nor guvern domestics; the clothes wil be ill washed, the food wil be\r\nbadly cooked; you wil be harrassed with disorders and irregularity in\r\nthe family; and you wil be ashamed of your wife, if she iz not ashamed\r\nof herself. A master of a vessel should not _come in at the cabin\r\nwindows_; nor should a man be placed at the hed of an army, without an\r\nintimate knowlege of the duty of a private soldier. How then can a lady\r\nbe qualified for the care of a family, without being acquainted with\r\nevery part of domestic bizziness? Sixthly, marry, if possible, a lady of\r\nvirtu and religion; for religion iz her best gard from temptation and\r\nthe allurements of vice. At any rate, _marry_. A _married man_,\r\nespecially a _father_, iz a better citizen than a bachelor. Hiz\r\nbenevolent affections are called in to exercize in hiz family; and he iz\r\nthus prepared to luv and to bless society in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. XXX.\r\n\r\n                         NEW YORK, 1788.\r\n\r\n_An_ ADDRESS _to_ YUNG LADIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n          MY AMIABLE FRENDS,\r\n\r\nAltho men in general are expozed to the suspicion of your sex, and their\r\nopinions are often construed into flattery or stratagem, yet the tenor\r\nof the following remarks wil, it iz presumed, bear such marks of\r\nsincerity az to giv them a place in your confidence. They are not the\r\nprecepts of a morose instructor, nor the opinions of a hoary sage who\r\nhaz lost all relish for the joys of life, and wishes to restrain the\r\ninnocent plezures of sense. They do not proceed from a peevish old\r\nbachelor, whom a phlegmatic constitution, or repeeted disappointments,\r\nhav changed into a hater of your sex; but they come from a heart capable\r\nof being softened by your charms or your misfortunes; a heart that never\r\nharbored a wish but to see and make you happy. They are the sentiments\r\nof a yung _frend_; one who haz lived long enuf, if not to feel his _own_\r\nfaults, at leest to _discuver_ thoze of others; and to form a tolerable\r\nestimate of your worth in social life.\r\n\r\nOur Saviour, when on erth, took a child in hiz arms and said, \"of such\r\niz the kingdom of heaven.\" I never view a circle of little misses\r\nwithout recollecting the divine comparison. A collection of sweet little\r\nbeings, with voices az melodious az the notes of the nightingale, whoze\r\ncheeks even a whisper wil cuver with blushes, and whoze hearts are az\r\npure az the falling snow drop; iz heaven in miniature. Such iz the\r\ndescription of my little female frends in the bloom of childhood. To\r\nprezerve that delicacy of mind, which nature furnishes; which\r\nconstitutes the glory of your sex, and forms the principal gard of your\r\nown virtue, iz the bizziness of education. In this article, you hav an\r\nopportunity to display the excellence of your character, and to exert\r\nyour talents most successfully in benefitting society.\r\n\r\nA woman without delicacy, iz a woman without reputation; for chastity\r\nreally exists in the mind; and when this fountain iz pure, the words and\r\nactions that flow from it, wil be chaste and delicate. Yung misses\r\ntherefore should be remooved az far az possible from all company that\r\ncan taint their minds, or accustom them to indecency of any kind. Their\r\nnurses, their companions, their teechers, should be selected from peeple\r\nof at leest uncorrupted morals and amiable manners.\r\n\r\nBut a more advanced stage of life, the time when yung ladies enter into\r\nsociety, iz, with respect to their future reputation, a period extremely\r\ncritical. Little, my deer friends, do you reflect, how important iz the\r\nmanner in which you enter into life. Prudery and coquetry are extremes\r\nequally to be shunned, becauze both are equally disagreeable to our sex,\r\nand fatal to your reputations. It haz been said that coquetts often\r\nlooze their reputation, while they retain their virtu; and that prudes\r\noften prezerve their reputation, after they hav lost their virtu. I\r\nwould only add this remark, that coquetts are _generally_, but prudes\r\n_almost always_ suspected; and suspicion iz az fatal to a female\r\nkaracter, az a crime. Iz this unjust? Coquetry and prudery are both\r\naffectation; every species of affectation dezerves punishment; and when\r\npersons relinquish their own natural karacters for thoze which are\r\nborrowed, iz it unjust to suspect their motivs, az a punishment for the\r\noffence?\r\n\r\nYou are taught to suspect the man who flatters you. But your good sense\r\nwil very eezily distinguish between expressions of mere civility and\r\ndeclarations of real esteem. In general one rule holds, that the man who\r\niz most lavish in declarations of esteem and admiration, luvs and\r\nadmires you the leest. A profusion of flattery iz real ground for\r\nsuspicion. Reel esteem iz evinced by a uniform course of polite\r\nrespectful behaviour. This iz a proof on which you may depend; it iz a\r\nflattery the most grateful to a lady of understanding, because it must\r\nproceed from a real respect for her karacter and virtues.\r\n\r\nPermit me here to suggest one caution. You are told that unmeening\r\nflattery iz an insult to your understandings, and sometimes you are apt\r\nto resent it. This should be done with great prudence. Precipitate\r\nresentment iz dangerous; it may not be dezerved at the time; it may make\r\nyou an enemy; it may giv uneeziness to a frend; it may giv your own\r\nharts pain; it may injure you by creating a suspicion that it iz all\r\naffectation. The common place civilities of dangling beaux may be very\r\ntrifling and disagreeable, but can rarely amount to an insult, or\r\ndezerve more than indifference and neglect. Resentment of such trifles\r\ncan hardly be a mark of tru dignity of soul.\r\n\r\nAt this period of life, let the prime excellence of your karacters,\r\n_delicacy_, be discuvered in all your words and actions. Permit me, az\r\none acquainted at leest with the sentiments of my own sex, to assure\r\nyou, that a man never respects a woman, who does not respect herself.\r\nThe moment a woman suffers to fall from her tung, any expressions that\r\nindicate the leest indelicacy of mind; the moment she ceeses to blush at\r\nsuch expressions from our sex, she ceeses to be respected; becauze az a\r\nlady, she iz no longer respectable. Whatever familiarity of conversation\r\nmay be vindicable or pardonable in ether sex alone, there iz, in mixed\r\ncompanies, a sacred decorum that should not be violated by one rude\r\nidea. And however dispozed the ladies may be to overlook small\r\ntransgressions in our sex, yet unforgiving man cannot eezily forget the\r\noffences of yours, especially when thoze offences discuver a want of all\r\nthat renders you lovely.\r\n\r\nIf your _words_ are to be so strictly watched, how much more attention\r\niz necessary to render your _conduct_ unexceptionable. You charge our\r\nsex, with being the seducers, the betrayers of yours. Admit the charge\r\nto be partially tru, yet let us be candid. Az profligate az many of our\r\nsex are acknowleged to be, it iz but justice to say, that very few are\r\nso abandoned az to attempt deliberately the seduction of an artless and\r\ninnocent lady, who shows, by her conduct, that she iz conscious of the\r\nworth of her reputation, and that she respects her own karacter. I hav\r\nrarely found a libertine who had impudence enuf to assail virtue, that\r\nhad not been expozed by some improprieties of conduct. There iz\r\nsomething so commanding in virtu, that even villans respect her, and\r\ndare not approach her temples but in the karacter of her votaries.\r\n\r\nBut when a woman iz incautious, when she iz reddy to fall into the arms\r\nof any man that approaches her, when she suffers double entendres,\r\nindecent hints and conversation to flow from her lips in mixed\r\ncompanies, she remooves the barriers of her reputation, she disarms\r\nherself, and thousands consider themselves at liberty to commence an\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nWhen so much depends on your principles and reputation; when we expect\r\nto derive all the happiness of the married life from that source, can it\r\nbe a crime to wish for some proof of your virtu before the indissoluble\r\nconnection iz formed? Iz that virtu to be trusted which haz never been\r\ntempted? Iz it absurd to say that an attack may be made even with\r\nhonorable intentions? Admit the absurdity; but such attempts are often\r\nmade, and may end in your ruin. The man may then be retched in hiz\r\nmistake becauze he iz disappointed in hiz opinion and expectations. Be\r\nassured, my frends, that even vile man cannot but esteem the woman who\r\nrespects herself. We look to you, in a world of vice, for that delicacy\r\nof mind, that innocence of life, which render _you_ lovely and\r\n_ourselves_ happy.\r\n\r\nDo you wish for admiration? But admiration iz az transient az the blaze\r\nof a meteor. Ladies who hav the most admirers, are often the last to\r\nfind valuable partners.\r\n\r\nDo you wish to be esteemed and luved? It iz eezy to render yourselves\r\nesteemable and lovely. It iz only by retaining that softness of manners,\r\nthat obliging and delicate attention to every karacter, which, whether\r\nnatural or acquired, are at some period of life, the property of almost\r\nevery female. Beauty and money, without merit, will sometimes command\r\neligible connections; but such connections do not answer the wishes of\r\nour hearts; they do not render us happy. Lerning, or an acquaintance\r\nwith books, may be a very agreeable or a very disagreeable\r\naccomplishment, in proportion to the discretion of the lady who\r\npossesses it. Properly employed, it iz highly satisfactory to the lady\r\nand her connections; but I beleev obzervation wil confirm my conjecture,\r\nthat a strong attachment to books in a lady, often deters a man from\r\napproaching her with the offer of hiz heart. This iz ascribed to the\r\npride of our sex. That the imputation iz always false, I wil not aver;\r\nbut I undertake to say, that if pride iz the cauze, it iz supported by\r\nthe order of nature.\r\n\r\nOne sex iz formed for the more hardy exercizes of the council, the field\r\nand the laborious employments of procuring subsistence. The other, for\r\nthe superintendance of domestic concerns, and for diffusing bliss thro\r\nsocial life. When a woman quits her own department, she offends her\r\nhusband, not merely becauze she obtrudes herself upon _hiz_ bizziness,\r\nbut becauze she departs from that sphere which iz assigned _her_ in the\r\norder of society; becauze she neglects _her_ duty, and leeves _her own_\r\ndepartment vacant. The same remark wil apply to the man who visits the\r\nkitchen and gets the name of a _betty_. The same principle which\r\nexcludes a man from an attention to domestic bizziness, excludes a woman\r\nfrom law, mathematics and astronomy. Eech sex feels a degree of pride in\r\nbeing best qualified for a particular station, and a degree of\r\nresentment when the other encroaches upon their privilege. This iz\r\nacting conformably to the constitution of society. A woman would not\r\nwillingly marry a man who iz strongly inclined to pass hiz time in\r\nseeing the house and furniture in order, in superintending the cooks,\r\nor in working gauze and tiffany; for she would predict, with some\r\ncertainty, that he would neglect hiz proper bizziness. In the same\r\nmanner, a man iz cautious of forming a connection with a woman, whoze\r\npredilection for the sciences might take her attention from necessary\r\nfamily concerns.\r\n\r\nLadies however are not generally charged with a too strong attachment to\r\nbooks. It iz necessary that they should be wel acquainted with every\r\nthing that respects life and manners; with a knowlege of the human hart\r\nand the graceful accomplishments. The greatest misfortune iz, that your\r\nerly studies are not always wel directed; and you are permitted to\r\ndevour a thousand volumes of fictitious nonsense, when a smaller number\r\nof books, at less trubble and expense, would furnish you with more\r\nvaluable trezures of knowlege.\r\n\r\nTo be _lovely_ then you must be content to be _wimen_; to be mild,\r\nsocial and sentimental; to be acquainted with all that belongs to your\r\ndepartment, and leeve the masculine virtues, and the profound researches\r\nof study, to the province of the other sex.\r\n\r\nThat it may be necessary, for political purposes, to consider man az the\r\nsuperior in authority, iz to me probable. I question whether a different\r\nmaxim would not destroy your own happiness.\r\n\r\nA man iz pleezed with the deference hiz wife shows for hiz opinions; he\r\noften loves her even for her want of information, when it creates a kind\r\nof dependence upon hiz judgement. On the other hand, a woman always\r\ndespises her husband for hiz inferiority in understanding and knowlege,\r\nand blushes at the figure he makes in the company of men who possess\r\nsuperior talents. Do not theze facts justify the order of society, and\r\nrender some difference in rank between the sexes, necessary to the\r\nhappiness of both? But this superiority iz comparativ, and in some\r\nmezure, mutual. In many things, the woman iz az much superior to her\r\nhusband, az he iz to her, in any article of information. They depend on\r\neech other, and the assumption of any prerogativ or superiority in\r\ndomestic life, iz a proof that the union iz not perfect; it iz a strong\r\nevidence the parties _are_ not, or _wil_ not be happy.\r\n\r\nLadies are often ridiculed for their loquaciousness. But ridicule iz not\r\nthe worst punishment of this fault. However witty, sprightly and\r\nsentimental your conversation may be, depend on it, az a maxim that\r\nholds without exception, that the person who talks incessantly, wil soon\r\nceese to be respected. From congress to private families, the remark iz\r\ntru, that a man or woman who talks much, loozes all influence. To your\r\nsex, talkativness iz very injurious; for a man wil hardly ever chooze a\r\nnoizy loquacious woman for hiz companion. A delicate rezerv iz a\r\nbecuming, a commanding characteristic of an amiable woman; the want of\r\nwhich no brilliant accomplishments wil supply. A want of ability to\r\nconverse, iz scarcely so much censured, az a want of discretion to know\r\nwhen to speek and when to be silent.\r\n\r\nIn the choice of husbands, my fair reeders, what shall I say? It haz\r\nbeen said or insinuated, that you prefer men of inferior talents. This\r\niz not tru. You are sensible that a good address and a respectful\r\nattention, are the qualities which most generally recommend to the\r\nesteem of both sexes. A philosopher, who iz absent and stupid, wil not\r\nplease az a companion; but of two persons equal in other respects, the\r\nman of superior talents iz your choice. If my obzervations hav not\r\ndeceeved me, you pride yourselves in being connected with men of\r\neminence. I mention this to contradict the opinion maintained in the\r\nLounger, that ladies giv a sort of preference to men of inferior\r\ntalents. The opinion wants extension and qualification; it extends to\r\nboth sexes, when tru, but iz never tru, except when men of talents are\r\ndestitute of social accomplishments.\r\n\r\nMoney iz the great object of desire with both sexes; but how few obtain\r\nit by marriage? With respect to our sex, I confess, it iz not much to a\r\nman's credit to seek a fortune without any exertions of hiz own; but\r\nthe ladies often make a capital mistake in the meens of obtaining their\r\nobject. They ask, _what iz a man's fortune_? Whereas, if they are in\r\npursuit of welth, solid permanent welth, they should ask, _is he a man\r\nof bizziness_? _Of talents?_ _Of persevering industry?_ _Does he know\r\nthe use of money?_ The difference in the two cases iz this: The man of\r\nfortune, who haz not formed a habit of acquiring property, iz generally\r\nignorant of the use of it. He not only spends it, but he spends it\r\nwithout system or advantage, and often dies a poor man. But the man who\r\nknows how to _acquire_ property, generally keeps hiz expenditures within\r\nhiz income; in exerting hiz talents to _obtain_, he forms a habit of\r\n_uzing_ hiz property to advantage, and commonly enjoys life az wel in\r\n_accumulating_ an estate, az the man of fortune does in _dissipating_\r\none. My idea iz breefly this; that the woman who marries a man of\r\nbizziness, with very little property, haz a better chance for a fortune\r\nin middle life and old age, than one who marries a rich man who livs in\r\nidleness.\r\n\r\nAfter all, ladies, it depends much on yourselves to determin, whether\r\nyour families shall enjoy eezy circumstances. Any man may acquire\r\nsomething by hiz application; but _economy_, the most difficult article\r\nin conducting domestic concerns, iz the womans province.\r\n\r\nYou see with what frankness and candor I tell you my opinions. This iz\r\nundoutedly the best mode of conducting social intercourse, and\r\nparticularly our intercourse with the fairest part of the creation.\r\n\r\nI rite from feeling; from obzervation; from experience. The sexes, while\r\neech keep their proper sphere, cannot fail to render eech other social\r\nand happy. But frail az yours iz commonly represented, you may not only\r\nboast of a superior share of virtu yourselves, but of garding and\r\ncherishing ours. You hav not only an interest in being good for your\r\n_own_ sakes, but _society_ iz interested in your goodness; you polish\r\nour manners, correct our vices, and inspire our harts with a love of\r\nvirtue. Can a man who loves an amiable woman, abandon himself to vices\r\nwhich she abhors? May your influence over our sex be increesed; not\r\nmerely the influence of beauty and gay accomplishments, but the\r\ninfluence of your virtues, whoze dominion controls the evils, and\r\nmultiplies the blessings of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nThe text on page 37 has been moved to a footnote after the second\r\nparagraph on page 5 as the author suggests.\r\n\r\nIn some essays the writer makes extensive use of phonetical\r\nspelling.
