C.\r\n\r\n1903\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1903,\r\nby\r\nThe Thomas Jefferson Memorial Association\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note: Omitted text or text that was in cypher is denoted\r\nby asterisks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON AS A TACTICIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word \"tactician\" is usually applied to military movements, but\r\nit has a broader meaning than this; it embodies the idea  of a\r\npeculiar skill or faculty--a nice perception or discernment which\r\nis characterized by adroit planning or management, artfully directed\r\nin politics or diplomacy in government.\r\n\r\n    \"Of all creatures the sense of tact is most exquisite in\r\n    man\"--Ross: Microcosmia.\r\n\r\n                \"To see in such a clime,\r\n        Where science is new, men so exact\r\n        In tactic art\"--Davenant Madagascar.\r\n\r\nTrue statesmanship is the masterful art. Poetry, music, painting,\r\nsculpture and architecture please, thrill and inspire, but the great\r\nstatesman and diplomatist and leader in thought and action convinces,\r\ncontrols and compels the admiration of all classes and creeds. Logical\r\nthought, power of appeal and tactfulness never fail to command attention\r\nand respect. It has always been thus, and it will unquestionably so\r\nremain. Many really able and brilliant men, however, lack balance and\r\nthe faculty of calculation. They are too often swayed by emotions, and\r\ntheir intellectual powers, which otherwise might exert a controlling\r\ninfluence, are thus weakened, and often result in failure. True\r\ngreatness in a man is gauged by what he accomplished in life, and the\r\nimpress he left upon his fellow-men. It does not consist of one act, or\r\neven of many, but rather their effect upon the times in which he lived,\r\nand how long they endure after the actor is gone from the throng of the\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nAt the bar, in the pulpit, in the medical profession, and especially\r\nin political life, _tact_ is the _sine qua non_ to the highest degree\r\nof individual success. However gifted one may be, he cannot win\r\nconspicuous laurels in any calling or avocation, if he be deficient in\r\ntactfulness. The man who best understands human nature, knows how to\r\napproach people, and possesses the art of leading them, is the one who\r\nwill invariably have the largest following and will possess the\r\ngreatest amount of influence over his fellows. The fact cannot be\r\ndisputed that men of great brilliancy of intellect, without tact, have\r\nbeen distanced by others far less talented, who possessed the knack of\r\ngetting near to the masses with the object in view to lead and control\r\nthem. A military commander who knows how to muster and marshal his men\r\nso as to make them most effective when a battle is pending, will be\r\nunquestionably successful in manoeuvres and successful also in\r\nbattle; and it is equally true in statecraft, and in the learned\r\nprofessions as well. The skillful tactician is master of every\r\nsituation and is the victor in every important contest. But more than\r\nin any other calling is this true in politics. The successful leader in\r\nlegislative bodies,--he whose name is recorded on the legislative\r\njournal as the author of the most important measures which are enacted\r\ninto laws--is, without exception, that member who is tactful,\r\nthoughtful, industrious and sincere. It makes no difference how great\r\nhis natural endowments may be, if he be wanting in these elements his\r\nsuccess will be restricted to a narrow sphere; and the greatest of\r\nthese is tactfulness.\r\n\r\nThe world's great tacticians are few. In America I can mention but\r\nthree who are deserving of first rank,--Thomas Jefferson, Henry Clay\r\nand James G. Blaine. Neither represented the same generation, and\r\nneither was the exact counterpart of the others, but all of them were\r\nrenowned in their ability to control their fellow-men. Each possessed\r\nthat peculiar magnetic power to draw men around them and to win their\r\nconfidence and support. Each had but to say the word, and his wishes\r\nwere carried out. Each needed only to give the command to follow, and,\r\nlike drilled soldiers, the multitudes fell into line and were obedient\r\nto every order. They were evidently cast in a peculiar mould, and that\r\nparticular mould is limited seemingly to a single man in every\r\ngeneration. Why it is thus we know not, and yet we know that it is so.\r\nAs the precentor in a choir leads the masses with his baton, and under\r\ncorrect leadership they rarely miss a note, so does the great tactician\r\nissue his commands, and his wishes are supreme. I here write Jefferson,\r\nClay and Blaine as America's intrepid leaders and commanders in civil\r\nlife; these three, and the greatest of these was Jefferson, as he\r\nseemed to have learned in early life, more than any of his compeers,\r\nthat a little management will often avoid resistance, which a vast\r\nforce will strive in vain to overcome; and that it is wisdom to grant\r\ngraciously what he could not refuse safely, and thus conciliate those\r\nwhom he was otherwise unable to control.\r\n\r\nIn referring to a man who possesses a high grade of capacity in a\r\nparticular calling, we usually say he is _able_--_an able man_. The\r\nterm able, therefore, signifies more than _capable_, more than\r\nwell-informed, whether applied to an artist, a general, a man of\r\nlearning, or a judge. A man may have read all that has been written on\r\nwar, and may have seen it, without being _able_ to conduct a war. He\r\nmay be capable of commanding, but to acquire the name of an _able_\r\ngeneral he must command more than once with success. A judge may know\r\nall the laws, without being _able_ to apply the principles of law\r\nproperly. A learned man may not be able either to speak, or to write,\r\nor to teach in a commanding manner. An able man, then, is he who makes\r\na valuable use of what he knows. A capable man can do a thing; an able\r\none does it. The term _able_ cannot, therefore, be properly applied to\r\ngenius. It is not correct, according to my way of thinking, to say an\r\n\"able poet,\" an \"able painter,\" an \"able musician,\" an \"able orator,\"\r\nan \"able sculptor,\" because it is talent or genius, or both, that gives\r\none rank in these callings in life, or in these particular undertakings.\r\nThe word \"able,\" as I understand it, is applicable to those arts only\r\nwhich involve the exercise of the mind as a controlling factor. One may\r\nbe a great orator, according to the usual acceptation of the term\r\n\"great,\" and yet be only a declaimer and a rhetorician. That is to say,\r\nhe may be able to captivate audiences by his superior _action_, as\r\nDemosthenes defines oratory to be, and at the same time his elocution\r\nand rhetoric may be unexceptionable, yet he maybe in fact totally\r\nlacking in every element which goes to make up real greatness.\r\n\r\nIt may be correctly claimed that one may win distinction and renown by\r\nenergy and tact, and yet be deficient in both wit and learning. But\r\nusually men are measured by the success they make in life, just as a\r\ncarpenter is measured by his \"chips\"; and accepting this measure, it is\r\nexceedingly rare to find one who reaches above the rank of a ward\r\npolitician, unless he possesses those real elements of greatness which\r\nI choose to class as honesty, sobriety, manliness, sympathy, energy,\r\neducation, knowledge and fairness. I agree that a great tactician may\r\nnot _per se_ be a great man, but I do say that one who possesses this\r\nelement, usually embodies those other elements which are accepted\r\nordinarily as the true ingredients of greatness.\r\n\r\nJefferson did not rank in oratory with the Adamses, the Randolphs,\r\nJames Otis and Patrick Henry, who were contemporaneous with him. He\r\nwas, therefore, not by nature great in the sphere of oratory, and in\r\nhis public utterances he does not always show the habit of radical\r\nthought which gave the great Democratic party, which lived and ruled\r\nour country throughout the larger part of the nineteenth century, that\r\ntremendous moral force peculiar to that marvelous organization which he\r\nfounded and fostered throughout his long, useful and eventful life. Yet\r\nhis speeches, if they may be classed as such, were clear, logical,\r\nforceful, convincing. In politics, in literature, in everything that\r\nconcerned the world's forward movement in his day, his intellectual\r\nsympathies were universal, or as nearly so as it was possible for any\r\nman's to be. Men less learned and with lesser power of reason and\r\nthoughtfulness than he, have moved audiences to frenzy and have carried\r\nthem at will; but Jefferson, without this peculiar gift, certainly\r\npossessed a sufficiency of this power, which the broad culture of the\r\nscholar and the steadfast tension of the thinker can give to any man.\r\nHis addresses and writings are pregnant with profound aphorisms, and\r\nthrough his great genius transient questions were often transformed\r\ninto eternal truths. His arguments were condensed with such admirable\r\nforce of clearness that his utterances always found lodgment in the\r\nminds of both auditors and readers. Sensitive in his physical\r\norganization, easily moved to tenderness, and incapable of malice, he\r\nhad that ready responsiveness to his own emotions as well as to those\r\nof others, which always characterizes genius.\r\n\r\nWhile it may be said that oratory was not an art with Jefferson, yet\r\nhis ideas on all governmental questions were always so clear and strong\r\nand well matured that he never failed to express them forcefully and\r\neffectively. His wonderful intellect, upon all important occasions,\r\nnever failed to take hold on principle, justice, liberty and moral\r\ndevelopment, without which, as a part of its essence, the greatest mind\r\ncan never express itself adequately. His State papers and his addresses\r\nand writings reveal the highest order of intellect, and are marked with\r\na degree of originality peculiarly Jeffersonian. The doctrines he\r\nproclaimed and the principles he promulgated were so logical and sound\r\nthat they are cherished yet, and it is believed by millions of our\r\ncountrymen that they are as imperishable as the stars. Jefferson's\r\nphilosophical ideas of democratic government are as much alive to-day\r\nas they were when he was at the zenith of his glory in life, and this\r\ncannot be said of any other illustrious American who was\r\ncontemporaneous with him. It may be truthfully claimed that the lamp of\r\nliberty, which he, perhaps more than any other one American of his\r\ntimes helped to light, will never go out; and it may also be stated,\r\nwith an equal degree of truthfulness, that the brilliant star of his\r\nown personal and political greatness will never set.\r\n\r\nSome American writers have, from their standpoints of review,\r\nanimadverted upon certain alleged weaknesses of Jefferson as a great\r\nnational character. Although I do not indorse his position as favoring\r\n\"States' Rights\" and a Federal Government of restricted powers, as over\r\nagainst the broader doctrine promulgated by Washington, Adams, Jay and\r\nHamilton, of a centralized government or Union which, when national\r\nquestions are involved, should be, at all times, the supreme power of\r\nthe country, yet I concede to him wonderful foresight in advocating a\r\nConstitution that would grant to the States the greatest possible\r\nlatitude. Other critics have also barked along the trail of this\r\ndistinguished man of destiny, charging him with being a demagogue, a\r\njingoist, an infidel and the like, but their barking has made him all\r\nthe greater, and has added new laurels to his marvelous career. Faults\r\nhe may have had, but who has not? Weaknesses he may have had, but who\r\nis universally wise and strong? Burke, in his incomparable speech in\r\nthe English Parliament on the East India bill, spoke for many great men\r\nin history when he thus alluded to the younger Fox: \"He has faults; but\r\nthey are faults, that though they may, in a small degree, tarnish the\r\nlustre, and sometimes impede the march of his abilities, have nothing\r\nin them to extinguish the fire of great virtues. In those faults there\r\nis no mixture of deceit, of hypocrisy, of pride, of ferocity, of\r\ncomplexional despotism, or want of feeling for the distress of\r\nmankind.\"\r\n\r\nLike Charles James Fox, to whom Edmund Burke referred, Thomas Jefferson\r\nwas the foremost Commoner of his day, and he allowed no opportunity to\r\npass unimproved, to lift the common people to higher conceptions of\r\nlife and duty. Such men are rare, and I am glad to be able\r\nconscientiously to place the name of Thomas Jefferson, in many\r\nimportant respects, and particularly as the champion of the rights of\r\nthe common people, pre-eminently above all the other distinguished\r\nAmericans of his generation; and I wish it understood that I make this\r\nstatement upon a fair comprehensive knowledge of the acts and works of\r\nthe leading men of that period of our country's history.\r\n\r\nJefferson in early life accepted the idea or theory that the first and\r\nmost general truth in history is that men ought to be free. He\r\nevidently felt that if happiness is the end of the human race, then\r\nfreedom is the condition, and that this freedom should not be a kind of\r\na half escape from thralldom and tyranny, but it should be ample and\r\nabsolute. This theory is most admirably expressed in the opening of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, of which he was the sole author, and which\r\nwas adopted almost literally as he wrote it: \"We hold these truths to\r\nbe self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed\r\nby their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are\r\nlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights\r\ngovernments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from\r\nthe consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government\r\nbecomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to\r\nalter or abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its\r\nfoundations, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall\r\nseem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\" Democratic\r\nprinciples cannot be more clearly expressed than in the language above\r\nquoted, nor can any creed be more clearly defined. It is but just to\r\nstate, therefore, that no individual American represents more\r\ndistinctively the constructive power of the principles of popular\r\ngovernment than Thomas Jefferson, who was then as now the greatest of\r\nall Virginians save one--Washington. In all of his public acts he was\r\nupheld by his confidence in the people, and he was so tactful at all\r\ntimes that he never allowed himself to wander at any great distance\r\nfrom the masses of his fellows. His faith in the reserve power of the\r\npeople was imposing, and by this trustfulness he stamped himself as the\r\nmatchless leader of his times, and among the greatest leaders of all\r\ntimes. Excepting, perhaps, Washington and Lincoln, the name of\r\nJefferson is the most conspicuous of all Americans, and will endure\r\nlongest in the annals of the history of the Great Republic, because it\r\nmust be conceded that his theories of government have had more\r\ninfluence upon the public life of America than those of any other\r\nAmerican citizen, living or dead.\r\n\r\nThere was a sympathy between his heart and the great popular heart,\r\nwhich time and conditions have never shaken. Expressions from his\r\nwritings have become axioms, creeds and rallying cries to great\r\nmultitudes of his countrymen. Three quarters of a century have elapsed\r\nsince his death, and yet his ideas, doctrines and teachings are still\r\nquoted and accepted without any apparent diminution of their influence.\r\nCicero had in mind an exact prototype of Jefferson when he said,\r\n\"_Homines ad deos nulla re propius accedunt quam salutem hominibus\r\ndando._\"[1]\r\n\r\n      [1] There is no way by which man can approach nearer to the gods\r\n      than by contributing to the welfare of their fellow creatures.\r\n\r\nAuthentic history shows a persistent tendency of the Anglo-Saxon race\r\nin the unswerving direction of personal liberty. The inhabitants of the\r\nAmerican Colonies revealed a tenacity and self-assertiveness in this\r\ndirection to a greater extent than had ever been shown in England. The\r\nJeffersonian idea has ever been that there shall be no king; that the\r\nsovereign ruler should be placed on the same level and be judged by the\r\nsame principles as the humblest citizen; that the lords of the manors\r\nare entitled to no more privileges than the poorest peasant; that these\r\nrights are inalienable, and that any government which disregards them\r\nmust of necessity be tyrannical.\r\n\r\nIn his introduction to De Tocqueville's able \"Democracy in America,\"\r\nMr. John T. Morgan thus describes the formative period of the American\r\nRepublic, a period in which the name of Thomas Jefferson must, if\r\njustice be meted out to him, appear in every chapter, and in every\r\nimportant achievement that was then made:\r\n\r\n\"In the eleven years that separated the Declaration of the Independence\r\nof the United States from the completion of that act in the ordination\r\nof our written Constitution, the great minds of America were bent upon\r\nthe study of the principles of government that were essential to the\r\npreservation of the liberties which had been won at great cost and with\r\nheroic labors and sacrifices. Their studies were conducted in view of\r\nthe imperfections that experience had developed in the government of\r\nthe Confederation, and they were, therefore, practical and thorough.\r\nWhen the Constitution was thus perfected and established, a new form of\r\ngovernment was created, but it was neither speculative nor experimental\r\nas to the principles on which it was based. If they were true\r\nprinciples, as they were, the government founded upon them was destined\r\nto a life and an influence that would continue while the liberties it\r\nwas intended to preserve should be valued by the human family. Those\r\nliberties had been wrung from reluctant monarchs in many contests, in\r\nmany countries, and were grouped into creeds and established in\r\nordinances sealed with blood, in many great struggles of the people.\r\nThey were not new to the people. They were consecrated theories, but no\r\ngovernment had been previously established for the great purpose of\r\ntheir preservation and enforcement. That which was experimental in our\r\nplan of government was the question whether democratic rule could be so\r\norganized and conducted that it would not degenerate into license and\r\nresult in the tyranny of absolutism, without saving to the people the\r\npower so often found necessary of representing or destroying their\r\nenemy, when he was found in the person of a single despot.\"\r\n\r\nIn this excerpt the true democratic principles upon which the American\r\nRepublic was founded, and which principles were largely conceived and\r\nput in shape by Thomas Jefferson, are clearly and concisely set forth.\r\nDe Tocqueville, born and reared amid monarchial surroundings, though\r\nbrilliant and learned as he was, could not measure the depths to which\r\nJefferson had dug into the labyrinths of free thought and free\r\ninstitutions, and the consequence was that all of his conjectures as to\r\nthe life and perpetuity of a government based upon the will and wishes\r\nof its subjects could not endure, went for naught, and subjected him to\r\na just criticism not only by the advocates of such a government, but by\r\nthe government itself. Daniel Webster in the Senate of the United\r\nStates, while defending the doctrines of universal liberty, for which\r\nthe State of Massachusetts had always stood, in his great speech in\r\nreply to Senator Hayne, of South Carolina, exclaimed in stentorian\r\nvoice, \"I shall enter on no encomium upon Massachusetts; she needs\r\nnone. There she is. Behold her and judge for yourself. There is her\r\nhistory; the inhabitants know it by heart.\" So we can say to De\r\nTocqueville, who had said of the Government of the United States, that\r\nit is all sail and no ballast, and that it possessed no power to resist\r\ninternal strife, and, therefore, could not endure: there she is; she\r\nneeds no encomium by us; there she stands, and she has stood firmly in\r\nthe face of all sorts of opposition for more than a hundred years, and\r\nwe believe she will endure forever!\r\n\r\nIn close relationship to that reign of democratic government which\r\nJefferson so earnestly sought to establish, lies, in open view, the\r\nnecessity for the education of the people, and to its accomplishment he\r\ndedicated, in early life, his talents and his energies. He saw then,\r\nand we, at this later period of our national growth and development,\r\nrealize it all the more, that the strength and perpetuity of all free\r\ngovernments rest mainly upon the education of their subjects. Without\r\nit such governments fall easy victims to ignorant military captains and\r\ncivil demagogues of low repute. Free government is better than monarchy\r\nin proportion to the intelligence of the governed. Where every citizen\r\nhas by systematic training been rooted and grounded in the fruitful\r\nsoil of knowledge, the principles and practices of self-restraint, and\r\nthe generous ways of freedom, his loyalty to country cannot easily be\r\nshaken, nor can he easily be drawn into hostile schemes against the\r\ngovernment that protects him. Jefferson saw clearly the necessity of a\r\ngeneral system of education, and was among the very first to move in\r\nthe direction of its establishment. He was so earnest an advocate of\r\nthe necessity for and the advantages of education, that he never\r\nrelaxed his efforts, although vigorously opposed by many of his able\r\nassociates, until he established the University of Virginia to be\r\nfinally supported by the State, as an open forum for the education of\r\nthe young men of the Commonwealth; and his biographers inform us that\r\nhe regarded this the most important achievement of his great career. In\r\nfact, he esteemed this victory so highly that he directed the words to\r\nbe placed upon his tombstone at Monticello--\"Founder of the University\r\nof Virginia.\" No act of his revealed more fully than this the tactician\r\nand the statesman, and no single act of his, although his entire career\r\nwas strewn with great deeds, did so much to usher in a golden era of\r\nhumanity and an universal monarchy of man, which, under God, is coming\r\nby and by.\r\n\r\nJefferson began public life early. Shortly after his graduation from\r\nWilliam and Mary's College, the oldest educational institution in\r\nVirginia, he took up the study of law, and within a very few years he\r\nhad gathered about him a profitable clientage. In this, the foremost of\r\nthe learned professions, his genius as a tactician was early displayed.\r\nOn account of his comparative youthfulness and the limited time that he\r\nhad been at the bar, he could not, in the nature of things, have been\r\nan erudite lawyer, and yet the registry of the courts before which he\r\npractised showed that in the fourth year, after he became a barrister,\r\nhe was employed in four hundred and thirty important cases. No one but\r\na tactful man, however great his learning, in so short a period of\r\ntime, could make a record of that exalted grade. He was, therefore, at\r\nthe beginning of his career as a public man, frank, earnest, cordial,\r\nsympathetic in his manner, full of confidence in men, and sanguine in\r\nhis views of life, which gave him a grip upon those about him, as a\r\nleader equipped by nature for achievements of the highest and most\r\nimportant possibilities.\r\n\r\nAs a delegate to the Second Continental Congress Mr. Jefferson had a\r\nleading share in its deliberations, although that body embraced many of\r\nthe most distinguished men of that period. The most important act of\r\nthat assembly was the adoption of the Declaration of Independence,\r\nwhich, as I have already stated, he himself drafted. It is said,\r\nhowever, that he was most valuable in committee work, because of the\r\naptness of his sensible and methodical mind, and the ingenuity he\r\npossessed in putting his ideas upon paper, and doing it in such a way\r\nas to create but little, if any, antagonisms. In all of the official\r\nstations in which he was placed by his fellow citizens, by means of his\r\ntalents for constructive statesmanship, and his persuasive and\r\nconciliatory spirit, he invariably displayed a remarkable talent for\r\ntact in parliamentary leadership.\r\n\r\nMilitary chieftains often win immortal renown as the result of a single\r\nimportant battle, and often flash like rush-light stars across the sky\r\nof history. But this is not true of men like Jefferson and others of\r\nhis class. They _grow_ into great characters, and they build\r\nmonuments to their memories which the tooth of time cannot destroy.\r\nThere is nothing ephemeral or evanescent in the makeup of their\r\nrecords. They build not for a day nor a year, but for the centuries.\r\nIndeed, it may be said that they build for eternity, and thus many of\r\nthem have builded wiser than they knew. The following is a summary of\r\nJefferson's achievements:\r\n\r\n 1. Jefferson, although eight years at the bar, became a lawyer of\r\nrenown, and an acknowledged leader in the profession.\r\n\r\n 2. For many years he was a member of the House of Burgesses of\r\nVirginia, and possessed therein an influence almost supreme.\r\n\r\n 3. He was a member of different conventions, selected by the people of\r\nVirginia, to consider the state of the colony, to provide against\r\ntaxation without representation, and to secure greater liberties for\r\nthe people, and was a leader in them all.\r\n\r\n 4. He was chairman of the three committees appointed in 1774 by the\r\nVirginia Convention, (1) to provide for the better education of the\r\npeople; (2), for the arming of the militia of the colony; and (3), to\r\ndraw up a statement of the causes which had impelled the colonies to\r\ntake up arms against the mother country.\r\n\r\n 5. He was a member of the Continental Congress which adopted the\r\nDeclaration of American Independence, and was the writer of that\r\nimmortal document, which of itself entitles him to enduring fame. For\r\nmore than a century and a quarter it has been read every year in all\r\nparts of the Republic to assembled multitudes on the anniversary of its\r\nratification, and it has been used as a model by all peoples since its\r\nadoption, who have sought to secure for themselves freedom and\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\n 6. He was Governor of Virginia during the latter part of the\r\nRevolution, and at the end of his term of office, the House of\r\nBurgesses publicly thanked him for the able and patriotic services\r\nrendered by him during his administration of that exalted station.\r\n\r\n 7. He, while a member of the American Congress after the adoption of\r\nour present Constitution, was the author of the system of coinage\r\nwhich, with some amendments, is still in vogue in the United States.\r\n\r\n 8. He was, in the early years of the Republic, twice commissioned by\r\nCongress as Minister Plenipotentiary to negotiate treaties of commerce\r\nwith European States, and in this, as in all other public undertakings,\r\nhe exhibited the highest character of tact and diplomacy.\r\n\r\n 9. He was five years Minister to France, was exceedingly popular, and\r\nsecured several important modifications of the French tariff in the\r\ninterests of American commerce.\r\n\r\n10. As the first Secretary of State under Washington, he handled, with\r\nconsummate skill, the perplexing international questions which grew out\r\nof the war declared by France in 1793, against Holland and Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n11. In 1796 he became Vice-President, and was elevated to the\r\nPresidency in 1800, and was reelected in 1804. In this great office he\r\nregarded himself purely as a trustee of the public, and the simplicity\r\nof his customs and his manly demeanor in office brought to him the\r\nconfidence of the people of the country at large.\r\n\r\n12. The crowning glory of his administration was the purchase of the\r\nterritory of Louisiana from France. This single act made his\r\nadministration historic, and the people are even now only beginning to\r\nfully appreciate it as they should.\r\n\r\n13. In the manner in which he controlled politics during his two terms\r\nas President, which resulted almost in the total absorption or\r\nannihilation of the Federalist party, he exhibited the qualities of a\r\ntactician rarely, if ever, equaled.\r\n\r\n14. After forty years of public life, the illustrious Commoner retired\r\nto private life upon his farm at Monticello, and gave his remaining\r\nyears to the establishment and building up of the University of\r\nVirginia, which became a noted centre of learning before his death, and\r\nhas been, for over three quarters of a century, the leading university\r\nof the South.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson was a great man, a great diplomatist, a great\r\ntactician and an illustrious citizen and patriot. His name and his\r\ndeeds will be cherished and admired as long as the English language is\r\nread or spoken, and as long as human lips lisp the name of liberty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Handwritten signature of G.

They propose that partners interested one\r\nhalf in the establishment, should be American citizens, born and\r\nresiding in the United States. Yet if I understood them rightly, they\r\nexpect that that half of the company which resides here, should make\r\nthe greatest part, or perhaps the whole of the advances, while those\r\non our side of the water should superintend the details. They had,\r\nat first, thought of Baltimore as the centre of their American\r\ntransactions. I have pointed out to them the advantages of Alexandria\r\nfor this purpose. They have concluded to take information as to\r\nBaltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, for a principal deposit, and\r\nhaving no correspondent at Alexandria, have asked me to procure a state\r\nof the advantages of that place, as also to get a recommendation of the\r\nbest merchant there, to be adopted as partner and head of the business\r\nthere. Skill, punctuality and integrity are the requisites in such a\r\ncharacter. They will decide on their whole information, as to the place\r\nfor their principal factory. Being unwilling that Alexandria should lose\r\nits pretensions, I have undertaken to procure them information as to\r\nthat place. If they undertake this trade at all, it will be on so great\r\na scale as to decide the current of the Indian trade to the place they\r\nadopt. I have no acquaintance at Alexandria or in its neighborhood; but,\r\nbelieving you would feel an interest in the matter, from the same\r\nmotives which I do, I venture to ask the favor of you to recommend to me\r\na proper merchant for their purpose, and to engage some well-informed\r\nperson to send me a representation of the advantages of Alexandria, as\r\nthe principal deposit of the fur trade.\r\n\r\nThe author of the political part of the \"Encyclopedie Methodique\"\r\ndesired me to examine his article, \"Etats Unis.\" I did so. I found it a\r\ntissue of errors; for, in truth, they know nothing about us here.\r\nParticularly, however, the article \"Cincinnati\" was a mere philippic\r\nagainst that institution; in which it appeared that there was an utter\r\nignorance of facts and motives. I gave him notes on it. He reformed it,\r\nas he supposed, and sent it again to me to revise. In this reformed\r\nstate, Colonel Humphreys saw it. I found it necessary to write that\r\narticle for him. Before I gave it to him, I showed it to the Marquis de\r\nLa Fayette, who made a correction or two. I then sent it to the author.\r\nHe used the materials, mixing a great deal of his own with them. In a\r\nwork, which is sure of going down to the latest posterity, I thought it\r\nmaterial to set facts to rights as much as possible. The author was\r\nwell disposed; but could not entirely get the better of his original\r\nbias. I send you the article as ultimately published. If you find any\r\nmaterial errors in it, and will be so good as to inform me of them, I\r\nshall probably have opportunities of setting this author to rights.\r\nWhat has heretofore passed between us on this institution, makes it my\r\nduty to mention to you, that I have never heard a person in Europe,\r\nlearned or unlearned, express his thoughts on this institution, who did\r\nnot consider it as dishonorable and destructive to our governments; and\r\nthat every writing which has come out since my arrival here, in which\r\nit is mentioned, considers it, even as now reformed, as the germ whose\r\ndevelopment is one day to destroy the fabric we have reared. I did not\r\napprehend this, while I had American ideas only. But I confess that\r\nwhat I have seen in Europe has brought me over to that opinion; and\r\nthat though the day may be at some distance, beyond the reach of our\r\nlives perhaps, yet it will certainly come, when a single fibre left of\r\nthis institution will produce an hereditary aristocracy, which will\r\nchange the form of our governments from the best to the worst in the\r\nworld. To know the mass of evil which flows from this fatal source, a\r\nperson must be in France; he must see the finest soil, the finest\r\nclimate, the most compact State, the most benevolent character of\r\npeople, and every earthly advantage combined, insufficient to prevent\r\nthis scourge from rendering existence a curse to twenty-four out of\r\ntwenty-five parts of the inhabitants of this country. With us, the\r\nbranches of this institution cover all the States. The southern ones,\r\nat this time, are aristocratical in their dispositions; and, that that\r\nspirit should grow and extend itself, is within the natural order of\r\nthings. I do not flatter myself with the immortality of our\r\ngovernments; but I shall think little also of their longevity, unless\r\nthis germ of destruction be taken out. When the society themselves\r\nshall weigh the possibility of evil, against the impossibility of any\r\ngood to proceed from this institution, I cannot help hoping they will\r\neradicate it. I know they wish the permanence of our governments, as\r\nmuch as any individuals composing them.\r\n\r\nAn interruption here, and the departure of the gentleman by whom I send\r\nthis, oblige me to conclude it, with assurances of the sincere respect\r\nand esteem with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR CHAS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 7, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I should with great pleasure have perused your manuscript of the\r\nhistory of the American Revolution, but that it comes to me in the\r\nmoment of my setting out on a journey into the south of France, where I\r\nam to pass the winter. In the few moments of leisure which my\r\npreparations for that journey admitted, I have read some detached\r\nparts, and find that it would have been very interesting to me. In one\r\nof these (page 60), I have taken the liberty of noting a circumstance\r\nwhich is not true, and to which I believe M. d'Aubertueil first gave a\r\nplace in history. In page 75, I observe it says that Congress removed\r\nto Hartford, but this is a misinformation. They never sat there. In\r\ngeneral, I would observe to you, that where there is no other authority\r\nfor a fact than the history of d'Aubertueil, it will not be safe to\r\nhazard it. These authors have been led into an infinitude of errors,\r\nprobably by trusting to the English papers, or to the European ones,\r\ncopied from them. It is impossible to resort to a more impure source. I\r\nam much pleased to find, that you concur in the justice of the\r\nprinciples which produced our revolution, and have only to wish that I\r\ncould have been able to go through the whole work. I have the honor to\r\nbe, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DULER.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 8, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--The circumstance escaped me of my having had the honor of being\r\nmade known to you by Mr. Walker at Charlottesville. However, I should\r\nnot have been the less ready, had it been in my power, to have aided\r\nyou in procuring employment in some bureau here. But a stranger as I\r\nam, unconnected and unacquainted, my solicitations on your behalf would\r\nbe as ineffectual as improper. I should have been happy to have been\r\nable to render you this service, as I am sincerely concerned at the\r\ncircumstance which has placed you in need of it.\r\n\r\nAs to the paper money in your hands, the States have not yet been able\r\nto take final arrangements for its redemption. But, as soon as they\r\nshall get their finances into some order, they will surely pay for it\r\nwhat it was worth in silver at the time you received it, with interest.\r\nThe interest on loan-office certificates is, I think, paid annually in\r\nall the States; and, in some of them, they have begun to make payments\r\nof the principal. These matters are managed for foreigners by the\r\nconsul of their nation in America, where they have not a private friend\r\nto attend for them. I have the honor to be, Sir, with much respect,\r\nyour most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. WILT, DELMESTRE AND CO.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 11, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--Your favor of the 6th instant is duly come to hand, as had\r\ndone that also of the 8th of November. I was much obliged to you for\r\nyour observations and information on the late regulations. I have\r\nreceived and am still receiving from other quarters, other hints for\r\nits improvement. I cannot propose these to the minister as they arrive,\r\nbecause, besides the perpetual fatigue to him, the business would not\r\nbe so well done in the end. As soon as all the defects of the new\r\narrangement shall be discovered by a little experience, as well as by\r\ntheir being submitted to the gentlemen concerned in the commerce, I\r\nshall be able, by bringing all the amendments necessary into a single\r\nproposition, to submit them at once to the consideration of the\r\nminister. It will probably be yet some months before this can be done.\r\nIn the meantime, we must be contented to submit a little longer to\r\nthose remnants of burthen which still rest on our commerce. In this\r\nview, I will still thank you for any new hints of amendment which may\r\noccur to you in experience, assuring you they shall be put to good use,\r\nwhen the occasion shall serve. I have the honor to be, with much\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 16, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--After a very long silence, I am at length able to write to\r\nyou. An unlucky dislocation of my right wrist, has disabled me from\r\nusing that hand, three months. I now begin to use it a little, but with\r\ngreat pain; so that this letter must be taken up at such intervals as\r\nthe state of my hand will permit, and will probably be the work of some\r\ndays. Though the joint seems to be well set, the swelling does not\r\nabate, nor the use of it return. I am now, therefore, on the point of\r\nsetting out to the south of France, to try the use of some mineral\r\nwaters there, by immersion. This journey will be of two or three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nI enclose you herein a copy of the letter from the Minister of Finance\r\nto me, making several advantageous regulations for our commerce. The\r\nobtaining this has occupied us a twelve month. I say _us,_ because I\r\nfind the Marquis de La Fayette so useful an auxiliary, that\r\nacknowledgments for his co-operation are always due. There remains\r\nstill something to do for the articles of rice, turpentine, and ship\r\nduties. What can be done for tobacco, when the late regulation expires,\r\nis very uncertain. The commerce between the United States and this\r\ncountry being put on a good footing, we may afterwards proceed to try\r\nif anything can be done, to favor our intercourse with her colonies.\r\nAdmission into them for our fish and flour, is very desirable; but,\r\nunfortunately, both those articles would raise a competition against\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nI find by the public papers, that your commercial convention failed in\r\npoint of representation. If it should produce a full meeting in May,\r\nand a broader reformation, it will still be well. To make us one nation\r\nas to foreign concerns, and keep us distinct in domestic ones, gives\r\nthe outline of the proper division of powers between the general and\r\nparticular governments. But, to enable the federal head to exercise the\r\npowers given it to best advantage, it should be organized as the\r\nparticular ones are, into legislative, executive, and judiciary. The\r\nfirst and last are already separated. The second should be. When last\r\nwith Congress, I often proposed to members to do this, by making of the\r\ncommittee of the States, an executive committee during the recess of\r\nCongress, and, during its sessions, to appoint a committee to receive\r\nand despatch all executive business, so that Congress itself should\r\nmeddle only with what should be legislative. But I question if any\r\nCongress (much less all successively) can have self-denial enough to go\r\nthrough with this distribution. The distribution, then, should be\r\nimposed on them. I find Congress have reversed their division of the\r\nwestern States, and proposed to make them fewer and larger. This is\r\nreversing the natural order of things. A tractable people may be\r\ngoverned in large bodies; but, in proportion as they depart from this\r\ncharacter, the extent of their government must be less. We see into\r\nwhat small divisions the Indians are obliged to reduce their societies.\r\nThis measure, with the disposition to shut up the Mississippi, gives me\r\nserious apprehensions of the severance of the eastern and western parts\r\nof our confederacy. It might have been made the interest of the western\r\nStates to remain united with us, by managing their interests honestly,\r\nand for their own good. But, the moment we sacrifice their interests to\r\nour own, they will see it better to govern themselves. The moment they\r\nresolve to do this, the point is settled. A forced connection is\r\nneither our interest, nor within our power.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia act for religious freedom has been received with infinite\r\napprobation in Europe, and propagated with enthusiasm. I do not mean by\r\nthe governments, but by the individuals who compose them. It has been\r\ntranslated into French and Italian, has been sent to most of the courts\r\nof Europe, and has been the best evidence of the falsehood of those\r\nreports which stated us to be in anarchy. It is inserted in the new\r\n\"Encyclopedie,\" and is appearing in most of the publications respecting\r\nAmerica. In fact, it is comfortable to see the standard of reason at\r\nlength erected, after so many ages, during which the human mind has\r\nbeen held in vassalage by kings, priests, and nobles; and it is\r\nhonorable for us, to have produced the first legislature who had the\r\ncourage to declare, that the reason of man may be trusted with the\r\nformation of his own opinions.\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nI thank you for your communications in Natural History. The several\r\ninstances of trees, &c., found far below the surface of the earth, as\r\nin the case of Mr. Hay's well, seem to set the reason of man at\r\ndefiance.\r\n\r\nI am, dear Sir, with sincere esteem, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMPSON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 17, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A dislocation of my right wrist has for three months past,\r\ndisabled me from writing except with my left hand, which was too slow\r\nand awkward to be employed often. I begin to have so much use of my\r\nwrist, as to be able to write, but it is slowly, and in pain. I take\r\nthe first moment I can, however, to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\nletters of April the 6th, July the 8th and 30th. In one of these, you\r\nsay, you have not been able to learn, whether, in the new mills in\r\nLondon, steam is the immediate mover of the machinery, or raises water\r\nto move it? It is the immediate mover. The power of this agent, though\r\nlong known, is but now beginning to be applied to the various purposes\r\nof which it is susceptible. You observe that Whitehurst supposes it to\r\nhave been the agent, which bursting the earth, threw it up into\r\nmountains and valleys. You ask me what I think of his book? I find in\r\nit many interesting facts brought together, and many ingenious\r\ncommentaries on them. But there are great chasms in his facts, and\r\nconsequently in his reasoning. These he fills up by suppositions, which\r\nmay be as reasonably denied as granted. A sceptical reader therefore,\r\nlike myself, is left in the lurch. I acknowledge, however, he makes\r\nmore use of fact, than any other writer on a theory of the earth. But I\r\ngive one answer to all these theorists. That is as follows. They all\r\nsuppose the earth a created existence. They must suppose a creator\r\nthen; and that he possessed power and wisdom to a great degree. As he\r\nintended the earth for the habitation of animals and vegetables, is it\r\nreasonable to suppose, he made two jobs of his creation, that he first\r\nmade a chaotic lump and set it into rotatory motion, and then waited\r\nthe millions of ages necessary to form itself? That when it had done\r\nthis, he stepped in a second time, to create the animals and plants\r\nwhich were to inhabit it? As the hand of a creator is to be called in,\r\nit may as well be called in at one stage of the process as another. We\r\nmay as well suppose he created the earth at once, nearly in the state\r\nin which we see it, fit for the preservation of the beings he placed on\r\nit. But it is said, we have a proof that he did not create it in its\r\npresent solid form, but in a state of fluidity; because its present\r\nshape of an oblate spheroid is precisely that which a fluid mass\r\nrevolving on its axis would assume.\r\n\r\nI suppose that the same equilibrium between gravity and centrifugal\r\nforce, which would determine a fluid mass into the form of an oblate\r\nspheroid, would determine the wise creator of that mass, if he made it\r\nin a solid state, to give it the same spheroidical form. A revolving\r\nfluid will continue to change its shape, till it attains that in which\r\nits principles of contrary motion are balanced. For if you suppose them\r\nnot balanced, it will change its form. Now, the same balanced form is\r\nnecessary for the preservation of a revolving solid. The creator,\r\ntherefore, of a revolving solid, would make it an oblate spheroid, that\r\nfigure alone admitting a perfect equilibrium. He would make it in that\r\nform, for another reason; that is, to prevent a shifting of the axis of\r\nrotation. Had he created the earth perfectly spherical, its axis might\r\nhave been perpetually shifting, by the influence of the other bodies of\r\nthe system; and by placing the inhabitants of the earth successively\r\nunder its poles, it might have been depopulated; whereas, being\r\nspheroidical, it has but one axis on which it can revolve in\r\nequilibrio. Suppose the axis of the earth to shift forty-five degrees;\r\nthen cut it into one hundred and eighty slices, making every section in\r\nthe plane of a circle of latitude, perpendicular to the axis: every one\r\nof these slices, except the equatorial one, would be unbalanced, as\r\nthere would be more matter on one side of its axis than on the other.\r\nThere could be but one diameter drawn through such a slice, which would\r\ndivide it into two equal parts. On every other possible diameter, the\r\nparts would hang unequal. This would produce an irregularity in the\r\ndiurnal rotation. We may, therefore, conclude it impossible for the\r\npoles of the earth to shift, if it was made spheroidically; and that it\r\nwould be made spheroidical, though solid, to obtain this end. I use\r\nthis reasoning only on the supposition that the earth has had a\r\nbeginning. I am sure I shall read your conjectures on this subject with\r\ngreat pleasure, though I bespeak, beforehand, a right to indulge my\r\nnatural incredulity and scepticism. The pain in which I write awakens\r\nme here from my reverie, and obliges me to conclude with compliments to\r\nMrs. Thompson, and assurances to yourself of the esteem and affection\r\nwith which I am sincerely, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. Since writing the preceding, I have had a conversation on the\r\nsubject of the steam mills, with the famous Boulton, to whom those of\r\nLondon belong, and who is here at this time. He compares the effect of\r\nsteam with that of horses, in the following manner: Six horses, aided\r\nwith the most advantageous combination of the mechanical powers\r\nhitherto tried, will grind six bushels of flour in an hour; at the end\r\nof which time they are all in a foam, and must rest. They can work\r\nthus, six hours in the twenty-four, grinding thirty-six bushels of\r\nflour, which is six to each horse, for the twenty-four hours. His steam\r\nmill in London consumes one hundred and twenty bushels of coal in\r\ntwenty-four hours, turns ten pair of stones, which grind eight bushels\r\nof flour an hour each, which is nineteen hundred and twenty bushels in\r\nthe twenty-four hours. This makes a peck and a half of coal perform\r\nexactly as much as a horse, in one day, can perform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 18, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letters of August the 19th and October the 12th, have\r\ncome duly to hand. My last to you was of the 11th of August. Soon after\r\nthat date I got my right wrist dislocated, which has, till now,\r\ndeprived me of the use of that hand; and even now, I can use it but\r\nslowly, and with pain. The revisal of the Congressional intelligence\r\ncontained in your letters, makes me regret the loss of it on your\r\ndeparture. I feel, too, the want of a person there, to whose discretion\r\nI can trust confidential communications, and on whose friendship I can\r\nrely against the unjust designs of malevolence. I have no reason to\r\nsuppose I have enemies in Congress; yet it is too possible to be\r\nwithout that fear. Some symptoms make me suspect, that my proceedings\r\nto redress the abusive administration of tobacco by the Farmers General\r\nhave indisposed towards me a powerful person in Philadelphia, who was\r\nprofiting from that abuse. An expression in the enclosed letter of M.\r\nde Calonnes, would seem to imply, that I had asked the abolition of Mr.\r\nMorris's contract. I never did. On the contrary, I always observed to\r\nthem, that it would be unjust to annul that contract. I was led to\r\nthis, by principles both of justice and interest. Of interest, because\r\nthat contract would keep up the price of tobacco here, to thirty-four,\r\nthirty-six, and thirty-eight livres, from which it will fall when it\r\nshall no longer have that support. However, I have done what was right,\r\nand I will not so far wound my privilege of doing that, without regard\r\nto any man's interest, as to enter into any explanations of this\r\nparagraph with him. Yet I esteem him highly, and suppose that hitherto\r\nhe had esteemed me. You will see by Calonne's letter, that we are doing\r\nwhat we can, to get the trade of the United States put on a good\r\nfooting. I am now about setting out on a journey to the south of\r\nFrance, one object of which is to try the mineral waters there, for the\r\nrestoration of my hand; but another is, to visit all the seaports where\r\nwe have trade, and to hunt up all the inconveniences under which it\r\nlabors, in order to get them rectified. I shall visit, and carefully\r\nexamine too, the canal of Languedoc. On my return, which will be early\r\nin the spring, I shall send you several livraisons of the\r\n\"Encyclopedie,\" and the plan of your house. I wish to heaven, you may\r\ncontinue in the disposition to fix it in Albemarle. Short will\r\nestablish himself there, and perhaps Madison may be tempted to do so.\r\nThis will be society enough, and it will be the great sweetener of our\r\nlives. Without society, and a society to our taste, men are never\r\ncontented. The one here supposed, we can regulate to our minds, and we\r\nmay extend our regulations to the sumptuary department, so as to set a\r\ngood example to a country which needs it, and to preserve our own\r\nhappiness clear of embarrassment. You wish not to engage in the\r\ndrudgery of the bar. You have two asylums from that. Either to accept a\r\nseat in the Council, or in the judiciary department. The latter,\r\nhowever, would require a little previous drudgery at the bar, to\r\nqualify you to discharge your duty with satisfaction to yourself.\r\nNeither of these would be inconsistent with a continued residence in\r\nAlbemarle. It is but twelve hours' drive in a sulky from\r\nCharlottesville to Richmond, keeping a fresh horse always at the\r\nhalfway, which would be a small annual expense. I am in hopes that Mrs.\r\nM. will have in her domestic cares, occupation and pleasure, sufficient\r\nto fill her time, and insure her against the _tedium vitae_; that she\r\nwill find, that the distractions of a town, and the waste of life under\r\nthese, can bear no comparison with the tranquil happiness of domestic\r\nlife. If her own experience has not yet taught her this truth, she has\r\nin its favor the testimony of one who has gone through the various\r\nscenes of business, of bustle, of office, of rambling, and of quiet\r\nretirement, and who can assure her, that the latter is the only point\r\nupon which the mind can settle at rest. Though not clear of\r\ninquietudes, because no earthly situation is so, they are fewer in\r\nnumber, and mixed with more objects of contentment than in any other\r\nmode of life. But I must not philosophise too much with her, lest I\r\ngive her too serious apprehensions of a friendship I shall impose on\r\nher. I am with very great esteem, dear Sir, your sincere friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 20, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Colonel Franks will have the honor of delivering you the\r\ntreaty with the Emperor of Morocco, and all its appendages. You will\r\nperceive, by Mr. Barclay's letter, that it is not necessary that any\r\nbody should go back to Morocco to exchange ratifications. He says,\r\nhowever, that it will be necessary that Fennish receive some testimony\r\nthat we approve the treaty; and as, by the acts of Congress, our\r\nsignature is necessary to give validity to it, I have had duplicates of\r\nratifications prepared, which I have signed, and now send you. If you\r\napprove and sign them, send one back to me to be forwarded to Fennish,\r\nthrough Mr. Carmichael. Perhaps a joint letter should be written to\r\nFennish; if you think so, be so good as to write and sign one and send\r\nit with the ratification, and I will sign and forward it. The other\r\nratification is to go to Congress. Colonel Franks wishes to proceed\r\nwith the papers to that body. He should do it, I think, immediately, as\r\nMr. Jay, in a letter to me of October 26th, says that Congress have\r\nheard through the French Charge des Affaires, that the treaty was\r\nsigned, and they wonder they have not heard it from us.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a copy of a letter from Mr. Lambe, by which you will\r\nperceive he does not propose to quit Alicant. I will forward the\r\nresolution of Congress to Mr. Carmichael, which was enclosed in yours\r\nof November 30th, to see if that will move him. As the turn of this\r\nresolution admits a construction that Congress may think our original\r\nappointment of him censurable, I have, as in justice I ought, in a\r\nletter to Mr. Jay, taken on myself the blame of having proposed him to\r\nyou, if any blame were due. I have enclosed him a copy of my letter to\r\nyou of September 24, 1785. Mr. Barclay has proposed to go to Alicant to\r\nsettle Lambe's accounts, and asked to be strengthened with our\r\nauthority. If Lambe will obey the resolve of Congress, it will be\r\nbetter to let him go and settle his account there. But if he will not\r\ngo back, perhaps it might not be amiss for Mr. Barclay to have\r\ninstructions from us to require a settlement, those instructions to be\r\nused in that case only. If you think so, be so good as to write a joint\r\nletter and send it to me. But this, if done at all, should be done\r\nimmediately. How much money has Lambe drawn? I have suggested to Mr.\r\nJay the expediency of putting the Barbary business into Carmichael's\r\nhands, or sending somebody from America, in consideration of our\r\nseparate residence and our distance from the scene of negotiation.\r\n\r\nI had seen, without alarm, accounts of the disturbances in the East.\r\nBut Mr. Jay's letter on the subject had really affected me. However,\r\nyours sets me to rights. I can never fear that things will go far wrong\r\nwhere common sense has fair play. I but just begin to use my pen a\r\nlittle with my right hand, but with pain. Recommending myself,\r\ntherefore, to the friendship of Mrs. Adams, I must conclude here with\r\nassurances of the sincere esteem of, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. Should a Mr. Maury, of Virginia, but now a merchant of Liverpool,\r\npresent himself to you, I recommend him to your notice, as my old\r\nschool-fellow, and a man of the most solid integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HOPKINSON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 23, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last letter to you was dated August 14th. Yours of May\r\n27th and June 28th, were not then received, but have been since. I take\r\nthe liberty of putting under your cover another letter to Mrs. Champis,\r\nas also an inquiry after a Dr. Griffiths. A letter to M. le Vieillard,\r\nfrom the person he had consulted about the essence L'Orient, will\r\nconvey to you the result of my researches into that article. Your\r\nspring-block for assisting a vessel in sailing cannot be tried here,\r\nbecause the Seine, being not more than about forty toises wide, and\r\nrunning swiftly, there is no such thing on it as a vessel with sails. I\r\nthank you for the volume of the Philadelphia transactions, which came\r\nsafely to hand, and is, in my opinion, a very valuable volume, and\r\ncontains many precious papers. The paccan-nut is, as you conjecture,\r\nthe Illinois nut. The former is the vulgar name south of the Potomac,\r\nas also with the Indians and Spaniards, and enters also into the\r\nBotanical name which is Juglano Paccan. I have many volumes of the\r\n\"Encyclopedie\" for yourself and Dr. Franklin; but, as a winter passage\r\nis bad for books, and before the spring the packets will begin to sail\r\nfrom Havre to New York, I shall detain them till then. You must not\r\npresume too strongly that your comb-footed bird is known to M. de\r\nBuffon. He did not know our panther. I gave him the stripped skin of\r\none I bought in Philadelphia, and it presents him a new species, which\r\nwill appear in his next volumes. I have convinced him that our deer is\r\nnot a Chevreuil, and would you believe that many letters to different\r\nacquaintances in Virginia, where this animal is so common, have never\r\nenabled me to present him with a large pair of their horns, a blue and\r\nred skin stuffed, to show him their colors, at different seasons. He\r\nhas never seen the horns of what we call the elk. This would decide\r\nwhether it be an elk or a deer. I am very much pleased with your\r\nproject on the Harmonica, and the prospect of your succeeding in the\r\napplication of keys to it. It will be the greatest present which has\r\nbeen made to the musical world this century, not excepting the\r\nPiano-forte. If its tone approaches that given by the finger as nearly\r\nonly as the harpsichord does that of the harp, it will be very\r\nvaluable. I have lately examined a foot-bass newly invented here, by\r\nthe celebrated Krumfoltz. It is precisely a piano-forte, about ten feet\r\nlong, eighteen inches broad, and nine inches deep. It is of one octave\r\nonly, from fa to fa. The part where the keys are, projects at the side\r\nin order to lengthen the levers of the keys. It is placed on the floor,\r\nand the harpsichord or other piano-forte is set over it, the foot\r\nacting in concert on that, while the fingers play on this. There are\r\nthree unison chords to every note, of strong brass wire, and the lowest\r\nhave wire wrapped on them as the lowest in the piano-forte. The chords\r\ngive a fine, clear, deep tone, almost like the pipe of an organ. Have\r\nthey connected you with our mint? My friend Monroe promised me he would\r\ntake care for you in that, or perhaps the establishment of that at New\r\nYork may have been incompatible with your residence in Philadelphia. A\r\nperson here has invented a method of coining the French ecu of six\r\nlivres, so as to strike both faces and the edge at one stroke, and\r\nmakes a coin as beautiful as a medal. No country has ever yet produced\r\nsuch a coin. They are made cheaper, too. As yet, he has only made a few\r\nto show the perfection of his manner. I am endeavoring to procure one\r\nto send to Congress as a model for their coinage. They will consider\r\nwhether, on establishing a new mint, it will be worth while to buy his\r\nmachines, if he will furnish them. A dislocation of my right wrist,\r\nwhich happened to me about a month after the date of my last letter to\r\nyou, has disabled me from writing three months. I do it now in pain,\r\nand only in cases of necessity, or of strong inclination, having as yet\r\nno other use of my hand. I put under your cover a letter from my\r\ndaughter to her friend. She joins me in respects to your good mother,\r\nto Mrs. Hopkinson and yourself, to whom I proffer assurances of the\r\nesteem with which I am, dear Sir, your sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY DR. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 23, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received your favor of October 8, but the volume of\r\ntransactions mentioned to come with it, did not; but I had received one\r\nfrom Mr. Hopkinson. You also mention the diplomas it covered for other\r\npersons, and some order of the society relative to myself, which I\r\nsupposed were omitted by accident, and will come by some other\r\nconveyance. So far as relates to myself, whatever the order was, I beg\r\nleave to express to you my sense of their favor, and wish to merit it.\r\nI have several _livraisons_ of the \"Encyclopedie\" for yourself and Mr.\r\nHopkinson, which shall be sent in the spring, when they will be less\r\nliable to injury. Some books also which I received from Baron Blome\r\nmust await that conveyance. I receive some discouraging accounts of the\r\ntemper of the people in our new government, yet were I to judge only\r\nfrom the accounts given in the public papers, I should not fear their\r\npassing over without injury. I wish you may have given your opinion of\r\nthem to some of your friends here, as your experience and knowledge of\r\nmen would give us more confidence in your opinion. Russia and the Porte\r\nhave patched up an accommodation through the mediation of this court.\r\nThe coolness between Spain and Naples will remain, and will occasion\r\nthe former to cease intermeddling with the affairs of the latter. The\r\nDutch affairs are still to be settled. The new King of Prussia is more\r\nearnest in supporting the cause of the slaveholder than his uncle was,\r\nand in general an affectation begins to show itself of differing from\r\nhis uncle. There is some fear of his throwing himself into the Austrian\r\nscale in the European division of power. Our treaty with Morocco is\r\nfavorably concluded through the influence of Spain. That with Algiers\r\naffords no expectation. We have been rendered anxious here about your\r\nhealth, by hearing you have had a severe attack of your gout.\r\nRemarkable deaths are the Duchess of Chabot, of the House of\r\nRochefoucault, Beaujon, and Peyronet, the architect who built the\r\nbridge of Neuilly, and was to have begun one the next spring from the\r\nPlace Louis XV. to the Palais Bourbon. A dislocated wrist not yet\r\nre-established, obliges me to conclude here with assurances of the\r\nperfect esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. Will you permit my respects to your grandson, Mr. Franklin, to\r\nfind their place here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. STILES.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 24, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I feel myself very much honored by the degree which has been\r\nconferred on me by the Senatus Academicus of Yale College, and I beg\r\nleave, through you, Sir, to express to them how sensible I am of this\r\nhonor, and that it is to their and your indulgence, and not to any\r\nmerit of my own, that I am indebted for it.\r\n\r\nThe commotions that have taken place in America, as far as they are yet\r\nknown to me, offer nothing threatening. They are a proof that the\r\npeople have liberty enough, and I could not wish them less than they\r\nhave. If the happiness of the mass of the people can be secured at the\r\nexpense of a little tempest now and then, or even of a little blood, it\r\nwill be a precious purchase. \"Malo libertatem periculosam quam quietem\r\nservitutem.\" Let common sense and common honesty have fair play, and\r\nthey will soon set things to rights.\r\n\r\nThe bickerings between Russia and the Porte are quieted for the moment.\r\nThe coolness between the Kings of Spain and Naples will remain, but\r\nwill have no other consequence than that of the former withdrawing from\r\ninterference with the affairs of the latter. The present King of\r\nPrussia pushes the interest of the Stadtholder more zealously than his\r\nuncle did. There have been fears that he might throw himself into the\r\nAustrian scale, which would greatly derange the European balance. This\r\ncountry is firm in support of the patriotic party in the United\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nWe have made an advantageous treaty with Morocco, but with Algiers\r\nnothing is done. From what I learn from the temper of my countrymen and\r\ntheir tenaciousness of money, it will be more easy to raise ships and\r\nmen to fight these pirates into reason than money to bribe them. I wish\r\nthat something could be done in some form or another to open the\r\nMediterranean to us. You will have seen that France is endeavoring to\r\nrelieve and encourage our commerce with her.\r\n\r\nThe arts and sciences offering nothing new at this moment worth\r\ncommunicating to you, I shall only add assurances of the respect and\r\nesteem with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 25, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--A dislocation of my right wrist has for upwards of three months\r\nprevented my writing to you. I begin to use it a little for the pen;\r\nbut it is with great pain. To this cause alone I hope you will ascribe\r\nthat I have acknowledged at one time the receipt of so many of your\r\nletters. Their dates are September 12, 26, October 6, 17, 19, 23,\r\nNovember 3, 17, December 1, and there is one without date. They were\r\ncommunicated to the Marquis de LaFayette according to your desire, and\r\nthose to Mr. Jay have been forwarded from time to time as private\r\nconveyances occurred, except some of the last for which no such\r\nconveyance has occurred till now. A gentleman is setting out for\r\nLondon, and from thence for New York.\r\n\r\nWe receive news from America of collections of the people in three or\r\nfour instances in the Eastern States, demanding delays in the\r\nproceedings of the courts of justice. Those States, as you know,\r\ndepended before the war chiefly on their whale oil and fish. The former\r\nwas consumed in London, but, being now loaded with heavy duties, cannot\r\ngo there. Much of their fish went up the Mediterranean, now shut to us\r\nby the piratical States. Their debts, therefore, press them, while the\r\nmeans of payment have lessened. The mobs, however, separated without a\r\nsingle injury having been offered to the person or property of any one,\r\nnor did they continue twenty-four hours in any one place. This country\r\nhas opened a market for their whale oil, and we have made a good treaty\r\nof peace with Morocco. But with Algiers we can do nothing. An American\r\npaper has published a letter, as from me to the Count de Vergennes, on\r\nthe subject of our productions of tobacco and rice. It is surreptitious\r\nand falsified; and both the true and untrue parts very improper for the\r\npublic eye. How a newswriter of America got at it, is astonishing, and\r\nwith what views it had been altered. I will be much obliged to you if\r\nyou will endeavor to prevent its publication in the Leyden Gazette.\r\n\r\nThe following question I take the liberty of proposing to you\r\nconfidentially. This country wants money in its treasury. Some\r\nindividuals have proposed to buy our debt of twenty-four millions at a\r\nconsiderable discount. I have informed Congress of it, and suggested to\r\nthem the expediency of borrowing this sum in Holland, if possible, as\r\nwell to prevent loss to this country as to draw all their money\r\ntransactions to one point. But could they borrow the money in Holland?\r\nI would be obliged to you for your opinion on this question, as it\r\nwould decide me in pressing this matter further on Congress, or letting\r\nit drop. It will readily occur to you that the answer should come\r\nthrough the hands of your ambassador here alone. The pain in which I\r\nwrite obliges me, after many thanks for the interesting details of\r\ntransactions in your country, to assure you of the esteem and respect\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 26, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A note from me of the 22d of September, apprised you it\r\nwould be some time before I should be able to answer your letters. I\r\ndid not then expect it would have been so long.\r\n\r\nI enclose herein a resolution of Congress, recalling Mr. Lambe, which I\r\nwill beg the favor of you to have delivered him. I have written to Mr.\r\nAdams on the subject of directing him to settle with Mr. Barclay, and\r\nattend his answer. In the meantime, I am not without hopes Mr. Barclay\r\nhas done the business. I send also a note desiring Mr. Lambe to deliver\r\nyou his cypher, and a copy of a letter from the Minister of Finance\r\nhere, to me, announcing several regulations in favor of our commerce.\r\n\r\nMy \"Notes on Virginia,\" having been hastily written, need abundance of\r\ncorrections. Two or three of these are so material, that I am\r\nreprinting a few leaves to substitute for the old. As soon as these\r\nshall be ready, I will beg your acceptance of a copy. I shall be proud\r\nto be permitted to send a copy, also, to the Count de Campomanes, as a\r\ntribute to his science and his virtues. You will find in them that the\r\nNatural Bridge has found an admirer in me also. I should be happy to\r\nmake with you the tour of the curiosities you will find therein\r\nmentioned. That kind of pleasure surpasses much, in my estimation,\r\nwhatever I find on this side the Atlantic. I sometimes think of\r\nbuilding a little hermitage at the Natural Bridge (for it is my\r\nproperty) and of passing there a part of the year at least.\r\n\r\nI have received American papers to the 1st of November. Some tumultuous\r\nmeetings of the people have taken place in the eastern States; _i. e._\r\none in Massachusetts, one in Connecticut, and one in New Hampshire.\r\nTheir principal demand was, a respite in the judiciary proceedings. No\r\ninjury was done, however, in a single instance, to the person or\r\nproperty of any one, nor did the tumult continue twenty-four hours in\r\nany one instance. In Massachusetts, this was owing to the discretion\r\nwhich the malcontents still preserved; in Connecticut and New\r\nHampshire, the body of the people rose in support of government, and\r\nobliged the malcontents to go to their homes. In the last-mentioned\r\nState, they seized about forty, who were in jail for trial. It is\r\nbelieved this incident will strengthen our government. Those people are\r\nnot entirely without excuse. Before the war, these States depended on\r\ntheir whale oil and fish. The former was consumed in England, and much\r\nof the latter in the Mediterranean. The heavy duties on American whale\r\noil, now required in England, exclude it from that market; and the\r\nAlgerines exclude them from bringing their fish into the Mediterranean.\r\nFrance is opening her ports for their oil, but in the meanwhile, their\r\nancient debts are pressing them, and they have nothing to pay with. The\r\nMassachusetts Assembly, too, in their zeal for paying their public\r\ndebt, had laid a tax too heavy to be paid in the circumstances of their\r\nState. The Indians seem disposed, too, to make war on us. These\r\ncomplicated causes, determined Congress to increase their forces to two\r\nthousand men. The latter was the sole object avowed, yet the former\r\nentered for something into the measure. However, I am satisfied the\r\ngood sense of the people is the strongest army our government can ever\r\nhave, and that it will not fail them. The commercial convention at\r\nAnnapolis, was not full enough to do business. They found, too, their\r\nappointments too narrow, being confined to the article of commerce.\r\nThey have proposed a meeting in Philadelphia in May, and that it may be\r\nauthorized to propose amendments of whatever is defective in the\r\nfederal constitution.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in England, I formed a portable copying press, on the\r\nprinciples of the large one they make here, for copying letters. I had\r\na model made there, and it has answered perfectly. A workman here has\r\nmade several from that model. The itinerant temper of your court will,\r\nI think, render one of these useful to you. You must, therefore, do me\r\nthe favor to accept of one. I have it now in readiness, and shall send\r\nit by the way of Bayonne, to the care of Mr. Alexander there, unless\r\nDon Miguel de Lardizabal can carry it with him.\r\n\r\nMy hand admonishes me it is time to stop, and that I must defer writing\r\nto Mr. Barclay till to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and\r\nrespect, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 29, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--When I had the honor of seeing you in London, you were so kind as\r\nto permit me to trouble you sometimes with my letters, and particularly\r\non the subject of mathematical or philosophical instruments. Such a\r\ncorrespondence will be too agreeable to me, and at the same time, too\r\nuseful, not to avail myself of your permission. It has been an opinion\r\npretty generally received among philosophers, that the atmosphere of\r\nAmerica is more humid than that of Europe. Monsieur de Buffon makes\r\nthis hypothesis one of the two pillars whereon he builds his system of\r\nthe degeneracy of animals in America. Having had occasion to controvert\r\nthis opinion of his, as to the degeneracy of animals there, I expressed\r\na doubt of the fact assumed, that our climates are more moist. I did\r\nnot know of any experiments which might authorize a denial of it.\r\nSpeaking afterwards on the subject with Dr. Franklin, he mentioned to\r\nme the observations he had made on a case of magnets, made for him by\r\nMr. Nairne in London. Of these you will see a detail, in the second\r\nvolume of the American Philosophical Transactions, in a letter from Dr.\r\nFranklin to Mr. Nairne, wherein he recommends to him to take up the\r\nprinciple therein explained, and endeavor to make an hygrometer, which,\r\ntaking slowly the temperature of the atmosphere, shall give its mean\r\ndegree of moisture, and enable us thus to make with more certainty, a\r\ncomparison between the humidities of different climates. May I presume\r\nto trouble you with an inquiry of Mr. Nairne, whether he has executed\r\nthe Doctor's idea, and if he has, to get him to make for me a couple of\r\nthe instruments he may have contrived? They should be made of the same\r\npiece, and under like circumstances, that sending one to America, I may\r\nrely on its indications there, compared with those of the one I shall\r\nretain here. Being in want of a set of magnets also, I would be glad if\r\nhe would at the same time send me a set, the case of which should be\r\nmade as Dr. Franklin describes his to have been, so that I may repeat\r\nhis experiment. Colonel Smith will do me the favor to receive these\r\nthings from Mr. Nairne, and to pay him for them.\r\n\r\nI think Mr. Rittenhouse never published an invention of his in this\r\nway, which was a very good one. It was of an hygrometer which, like the\r\ncommon ones, was to give the actual moisture of the air. He has two\r\nslips of mahogany about five inches long, three-fourths of an inch\r\nbroad, and one-tenth of an inch thick, the one having the grain running\r\nlengthwise, and the other crosswise. These are glued together by their\r\nfaces, so as to form a piece five inches long, three-fourths of an inch\r\nbroad, and one-third of an inch thick, which is stuck by its lower end\r\ninto a little plinth of wood, presenting their edge to the view. The\r\nfibres of the wood you know are dilated, but not lengthened by\r\nmoisture. The slip, therefore, whose grain is lengthwise, becomes a\r\nstandard, retaining always the same precise length. That which has its\r\ngrain crosswise, dilates with moisture, and contracts for the want of\r\nit. If the right hand piece be the cross grained one, when the air is\r\nvery moist, it lengthens, and forces its companion to form a kind of\r\ninterior annulus of a circle on the left. When the air is dry, it\r\ncontracts, draws its companion to the right, and becomes itself the\r\ninterior annulus. In order to show this dilatation and contraction, an\r\nindex is fixed on the upper end of two of the slips; a plate of metal\r\nor wood is fastened to the front of the plinth, so as to cover the two\r\nslips from the eye. A slit, being nearly the portion of a circle, is\r\ncut in this plate, so that the shank of the index may play freely\r\nthrough its whole range. On the edge of the slit is a graduation. The\r\nobjection to this instrument is, that it is not fit for comparative\r\nobservations, because no two pieces of wood being of the same texture\r\nexactly, no two will yield exactly alike to the same agent. However, it\r\nis less objectionable on this account, than most of the substances\r\nused. Mr. Rittenhouse had a thought of trying ivory; but I do not know\r\nwhether he executed it. All these substances not only vary from one\r\nanother at the same time, but from themselves at different times. All\r\nof them, however, have some peculiar advantages, and I think this, on\r\nthe whole, appeared preferable to any other I had ever seen. Not\r\nknowing whether you had heard of this instrument, and supposing it\r\nwould amuse you, I have taken the liberty of detailing it to you.\r\n\r\nI beg you to be assured of the sentiments of perfect esteem and respect\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 31, 1786.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of addressing you on the 12th of the last month;\r\nsince which, your favor of October the 12th has been received,\r\nenclosing a copy of the resolution of Congress for recalling Mr. Lambe.\r\nMy letter by Mr. Randall informed you that we had put an end to his\r\npowers, and required him to repair to Congress. I lately received a\r\nletter from him, dated Alicant, October the 10th, of which I have the\r\nhonor to enclose you a copy; by which, you will perceive that the\r\ncircumstance of ill health, either true or false, is urged for his not\r\nobeying our call. I shall immediately forward the order of Congress. I\r\nam not without fear, that some misapplication of the public money may\r\nenter into the causes of his declining to return. The moment that I saw\r\na symptom of this in his conduct, as it was a circumstance which did\r\nnot admit the delay of consulting Mr. Adams, I wrote to Mr. Carmichael,\r\nto stop any moneys which he might have in the hands of his banker. I am\r\nstill unable to judge whether he is guilty of this or not, as by the\r\narrangements with Mr. Adams, who alone had done business with the\r\nbankers of the United States, in Holland, Mr. Lambe's drafts were to be\r\nmade on him, and I know not what their amount has been. His drafts\r\ncould not have been negotiated, if made on us both, at places so\r\ndistant. Perhaps it may be thought, that the appointment of Mr. Lambe\r\nwas censurable in the moment in which it was made. It is a piece of\r\njustice, therefore, which I owe to Mr. Adams, to declare that the\r\nproposition went first from me to him. I take the liberty of enclosing\r\nyou a copy of my letter to Mr. Adams, of September the 24th, 1785, in\r\nwhich that proposition was made. It expresses the motives operating on\r\nmy mind in that moment, as well as the cautions I thought it necessary\r\nto take. To these must be added, the difficulty of finding an American\r\nin Europe fit for the business, and willing to undertake it. I knew\r\nafterwards, that Dr. Bancroft (who is named in the letter) could not,\r\non account of his own affairs, have accepted even a primary\r\nappointment. I think it evident, that no appointment could have\r\nsucceeded without a much greater sum of money.\r\n\r\nI am happy to find that Mr. Barclay's mission has been attended with\r\ncomplete success. For this we are indebted, unquestionably, to the\r\ninfluence and good offices of the court of Madrid. Colonel Franks, the\r\nbearer of this, will have the honor to put into your hands the original\r\nof the treaty, with other papers accompanying it. It will appear by\r\nthese, that Mr. Barclay has conducted himself with a degree of\r\nintelligence and of good faith, which reflects the highest honor on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA copy of a letter from Captain O'Bryan to Mr. Carmichael, is also\r\nherewith enclosed. The information it contains will throw farther light\r\non the affairs of Algiers. His observations on the difficulties which\r\narise from the distance of Mr. Adams and myself from that place, and\r\nfrom one another, and the delays occasioned by this circumstance, are\r\ncertainly just. If Congress should propose to revive the negotiations,\r\nthey will judge whether it will not be more expedient to send a person\r\nto Algiers, who can be trusted with full powers; and also whether a\r\nmission to Constantinople may not be previously necessary. Before I\r\nquit this subject, I must correct an error in the letter of Captain\r\nO'Bryan. Mr. Lambe was not limited, as he says, to one hundred, but to\r\ntwo hundred dollars apiece for our prisoners. This was the price which\r\nhas been just paid for a large number of French prisoners, and this was\r\nour guide.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL OSGOOD.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 5, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am desired to forward to you the enclosed queries, and to\r\nask the favor of you to give such an answer to them, as may not give\r\nyou too much trouble. Those which stand foremost on the paper, can be\r\naddressed only to your complaisance; but the last may possibly be\r\ninteresting to your department, and to the United States. I mean those\r\nwhich suggest the possibility of borrowing money in Europe, the\r\nprincipal of which shall be ultimately payable in land, and in the\r\nmeantime a good interest. You know best whether the suggestion can be\r\nturned to any profit, and whether it will be worth while to introduce\r\nany proposition to Congress thereon. Among the possible shapes into\r\nwhich a matter of this kind may be formed, the following is one: Let us\r\nsuppose the public lands to be worth a dollar, hard money, the acre. If\r\nwe should ask of a moneyed man a loan of one hundred dollars, payable\r\nwith one hundred acres of land at the end of ten years, and in the\r\nmeantime carrying an interest of five per cent., this would be more\r\ndisadvantageous to the lender than a common loan, payable ultimately in\r\ncash. But if we should say, we will deliver you the one hundred acres\r\nof land immediately, which is in fact an immediate payment of the\r\nprincipal, and will nevertheless pay your interest of five per cent.,\r\nfor ten years, this offers a superior advantage, and might tempt money\r\nholders. But what should we in fact receive, in this way, for our\r\nlands? Thirty-seven dollars and one-fourth, being left in Europe, on an\r\ninterest of five per cent., would pay annually the interest of the one\r\nhundred dollars for ten years. There would remain then only sixty-two\r\ndollars and three-quarters, for the one hundred acres of land, that is\r\nto say, about two-thirds of its price. Congress can best determine,\r\nwhether any circumstance in our situation, should induce us to get rid\r\nof any of our debts in that way. I beg you to understand, that I have\r\nnamed rates of interest, term of payment, and price of land, merely to\r\nstate the case, and without the least knowledge that a loan could be\r\nobtained on these terms. It remains to inform you from whom this\r\nsuggestion comes. The person from whom I receive it, is a Monsieur\r\nClaviere, connected with the moneyed men of Amsterdam. He is, on behalf\r\nof a company there, actually treating with the Comptroller General\r\nhere, for the purchase of our debt to this country, at a considerable\r\ndiscount. Whether he has an idea of offering a loan to us, on terms\r\nsuch as I have above spoken of, I know not; nor do I know that he is\r\nauthorized to make the suggestion he has made. If the thing should be\r\ndeemed worthy the attention of Congress, they can only consider it as a\r\npossibility, and take measures to avail themselves of it, if the\r\npossibility turns out in their favor, and not to be disappointed if it\r\ndoes not. Claviere's proposition not being formal enough for me to make\r\nan official communication of it, you will make what use of it you see\r\nbest. I am, with very sincere esteem and attachment, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE CALONNE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 7, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor, on the 2d of November last, to acknowledge the\r\nreceipt of your Excellency's letter of October the 22d, wherein you are\r\nso good as to communicate to me the arrangements which the King had\r\nbeen pleased to make for the encouragement of the commerce of the\r\nUnited States of America with his subjects. I immediately made known\r\nthe same to the agents of the United States in the several seaports of\r\nthis kingdom, that they might give information thereof to the persons\r\nconcerned in that commerce. Unacquainted with the forms in which his\r\nMajesty usually declares his will in cases of this kind, and the manner\r\nin which it is communicated to the officers of the customs at the\r\nseaports, I am unable to answer those agents who inform me that the\r\nofficers of the customs and farms do not as yet consider themselves\r\nbound to conform to the new regulations. I take the liberty, therefore,\r\nof soliciting your Excellency's interposition for the issuing such\r\norders as may be necessary for carrying into effect the gracious\r\nintentions of the King, and of repeating the assurances of those\r\nsentiments of perfect respect and esteem, with which I have the honor\r\nto be your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last of December the 31st, acknowledged the receipt of yours\r\nof October the 12th, as the present does those of October the 3d, 9th,\r\nand 27th, together with the resolution of Congress of October the 16th,\r\non the claim of Shweighauser. I will proceed in this business on the\r\nreturn of Mr. Barclay, who, being fully acquainted with all the\r\ncircumstances, will be enabled to give me that information, want of\r\nwhich might lead me to do wrong on the one side or the other.\r\n\r\nInformation of the signature of the treaty with Morocco has been long\r\non its passage to you. I will beg leave to recur to dates, that you may\r\nsee that no part of it has been derived from me. The first notice I had\r\nof it, was in a letter from Mr. Barclay, dated Daralbeyda, August the\r\n11th. I received this on the 13th of September. No secure conveyance\r\noffered till the 26th of the same month, being thirteen days after my\r\nreceipt of it. In my letter of that date, which went by the way of\r\nLondon, I had the honor to enclose you a copy of Mr. Barclay's letter.\r\nThe conveyance of the treaty itself is suffering a delay here at\r\npresent, which all my anxiety cannot prevent. Colonel Franks' baggage,\r\nwhich came by water from Cadiz to Rouen, has been long and hourly\r\nexpected. The moment it arrives, he will set out to London, to have\r\nduplicates of the treaty signed by Mr. Adams, and from thence he will\r\nproceed to New York.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier del Pinto, who treated with us on behalf of Portugal,\r\nbeing resident at London, I have presumed that causes of the delay of\r\nthat treaty had been made known to Mr. Adams, and by him communicated\r\nto you. I will write to him by Colonel Franks, in order that you may be\r\nanswered on that subject.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the enclosed extract from my letter of May the 27th,\r\n1786, will, I fear, have very mischievous effects. It will tend to draw\r\non the Count de Vergennes the formidable phalanx of the Farms; to\r\nprevent his committing himself to me in any conversation which he does\r\nnot mean for the public papers; to inspire the same diffidence into all\r\nother ministers, with whom I might have to transact business; to defeat\r\nthe little hope, if any hope existed, of getting rid of the Farm on the\r\narticle of tobacco; and to damp that freedom of communication which the\r\nresolution of Congress of May the 3d, 1784, was intended to\r\nre-establish.\r\n\r\nObserving by the proceedings of Congress, that they are about to\r\nestablish a coinage, I think it my duty to inform them, that a Swiss,\r\nof the name of Drost, established here, has invented a method of\r\nstriking the two faces and the edge of a coin, at one stroke. By this,\r\nand other simplifications of the process of coinage, he is enabled to\r\ncoin from twenty-five thousand to thirty thousand pieces a day, with\r\nthe assistance of only two persons, the pieces of metal being first\r\nprepared. I send you by Colonel Franks three coins of gold, silver and\r\ncopper, which you will perceive to be perfect medals; and I can assure\r\nyou, from having seen him coin many, that every piece is as perfect as\r\nthese. There has certainly never yet been seen any coin, in any\r\ncountry, comparable to this. The best workmen in this way, acknowledge\r\nthat his is like a new art. Coin should always be made in the highest\r\nperfection possible, because it is a great guard against the danger of\r\nfalse coinage. This man would be willing to furnish his implements to\r\nCongress, and if they please, he will go over and instruct a person to\r\ncarry on the work: nor do I believe he would ask anything unreasonable.\r\nIt would be very desirable, that in the institution of a new coinage,\r\nwe could set out on so perfect a plan as this, and the more so, as\r\nwhile the work is so exquisitely done, it is done cheaper.\r\n\r\nI will certainly do the best I can for the reformation of the consular\r\nconvention, being persuaded that our States would be very unwilling to\r\nconform their laws either to the convention, or to the scheme. But it\r\nis too difficult and too delicate, to form sanguine hopes. However,\r\nthat there may be room to reduce the convention, as much as\r\ncircumstances will admit, will it not be expedient for Congress to give\r\nme powers, in which there shall be no reference to the scheme? The\r\npowers sent me, oblige me to produce that scheme, and certainly, the\r\nmoment it is produced, they will not abate a tittle from it. If they\r\nrecollect the scheme, and insist on it, we can but conclude it; but if\r\nthey have forgotten it (which may be), and are willing to reconsider\r\nthe whole subject, perhaps we may get rid of something the more of it.\r\nAs the delay is not injurious to us, because the convention, whenever\r\nand however made, is to put us in a worse state than we are in now, I\r\nshall venture to defer saying a word on the subject, till I can hear\r\nfrom you in answer to this. The full powers may be sufficiently\r\nguarded, by private instructions to me, not to go beyond the former\r\nscheme. This delay may be well enough ascribed (whenever I shall have\r\nreceived new powers) to a journey I had before apprised the minister\r\nthat I should be obliged to take, to some mineral waters in the south\r\nof France, to see if, by their aid, I may recover the use of my right\r\nhand, of which a dislocation, about four months ago, threatens to\r\ndeprive me in a great measure. The surgeons have long insisted on this\r\nmeasure. I shall return by Bordeaux, Nantes and L'Orient, to get the\r\nnecessary information for finishing our commercial regulations here.\r\nPermit me, however, to ask as immediately as possible, an answer,\r\neither affirmative or negative, as Congress shall think best, and to\r\nascribe the delay on which I venture, to my desire to do what is for\r\nthe best.\r\n\r\nI send you a copy of the late marine regulations of this country. There\r\nare things in it, which may become interesting to us. Particularly,\r\nwhat relates to the establishment of a marine militia, and their\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen in the public papers, that the King has called an\r\nassembly of the Notables of this country. This has not been done for\r\none hundred and sixty years past. Of course, it calls up all the\r\nattention of the people. The objects of this assembly are not named:\r\nseveral are conjectured. The tolerating the Protestant religion;\r\nremoving all the internal Custom-houses to the frontier; equalizing the\r\ngabelles on salt through the kingdom; the sale of the King's domains,\r\nto raise money; or, finally, the effecting this necessary end by some\r\nother means, are talked of. But in truth, nothing is known about it.\r\nThis government practises secrecy so systematically, that it never\r\npublishes its purposes or its proceedings, sooner or more extensively\r\nthan necessary. I send you a pamphlet, which, giving an account of the\r\nlast Assemblee des Notables, may give an idea of what the present will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nA great desire prevails here of encouraging manufactures. The famous\r\nBoulton and Watts, who are at the head of the plated manufactures of\r\nBirmingham, the steam mills of London, copying presses and other\r\nmechanical works, have been here. It is said also, that Wedgewood has\r\nbeen here, who is famous for his steel manufactories, and an earthen\r\nware in the antique style; but as to this last person, I am not\r\ncertain. It cannot, I believe, be doubted, but that they came at the\r\nrequest of government, and that they will be induced to establish\r\nsimilar manufactures here.\r\n\r\nThe transferring hither those manufactures, which contribute so much to\r\ndraw our commerce to England, will have a great tendency to strengthen\r\nour connections with this country, and loosen them with that.\r\n\r\nThe enfranchising the port of Honfleur at the mouth of the Seine, for\r\nmultiplying the connections with us, is at present an object. It meets\r\nwith opposition in the ministry; but I am in hopes it will prevail. If\r\nnatural causes operate, uninfluenced by accidental circumstances,\r\nBordeaux and Honfleur, or Havre, must ultimately take the greatest part\r\nof our commerce. The former by the Garonne and canal of Languedoc,\r\nopens the southern provinces to us; the latter, the northern ones and\r\nParis. Honfleur will be peculiarly advantageous for our rice and whale\r\noil, of which the principal consumption is at Paris. Being free, they\r\ncan be re-exported when the market here shall happen to be overstocked.\r\n\r\nThe labors of the ensuing summer will close the eastern half of the\r\nharbor of Cherbourg, which will contain and protect forty sail of the\r\nline. It has from fifty to thirty-five feet of water next to the cones,\r\nshallowing gradually to the shore. Between this and Dunkirk, the\r\nnavigation of the channel will be rendered much safer in the event of a\r\nwar with England, and invasions on that country become more\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of France and Leyden, to the present date, accompany this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 11, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Jay, in his last letter to me, observes they hear\r\nnothing further of the treaty with Portugal. I have taken the liberty\r\nof telling him that I will write to you on the subject, and that he may\r\nexpect to hear from you on it, by the present conveyance. The Chevalier\r\ndel Pinto being at London, I presume he has, or can inform you why it\r\nis delayed on their part. I will thank you also for the information he\r\nshall give you.\r\n\r\nThere is here an order of priests called the Mathurins, the object of\r\nwhose institution is, the begging of alms for the redemption of\r\ncaptives. About eighteen months ago, they redeemed three hundred, which\r\ncost them about fifteen hundred livres apiece. They have agents\r\nresiding in the Barbary States, who are constantly employed in\r\nsearching and contracting for the captives of their nation, and they\r\nredeem at a lower price than any other people can. It occurred to me,\r\nthat their agency might be engaged for our prisoners at Algiers. I have\r\nhad interviews with them, and the last night, a long one with the\r\nGeneral of the order. They offer their services with all the benignity\r\nand cordiality possible. The General told me, he could not expect to\r\nredeem our prisoners as cheap as their own, but that he would use all\r\nthe means in his power to do it on the best terms possible, which will\r\nbe the better, as there shall be the less suspicion that he acts for\r\nour public. I told him I would write to you on the subject, and speak\r\nto him again. What do you think of employing them, limiting them to a\r\ncertain price, as three hundred dollars for instance, or any other sum\r\nyou think proper? He will write immediately to his instruments there,\r\nand in two or three months we can know the event. He will deliver them\r\nat Marseilles, Cadiz, or where we please, at our expense. The money\r\nremaining of the fund destined to the Barbary business, may, I suppose,\r\nbe drawn on for this object. Write me your opinion, if you please, on\r\nthis subject, finally, fully and immediately, that, if you approve the\r\nproposition, I may enter into arrangements with the General, before my\r\ndeparture to the waters of Aix, which will be about the beginning of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL FRANKS.\r\n\r\nJanuary 11, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy anxiety, my dear Sir, on the detention of the Morocco treaty is\r\ninexpressible. However cogent and necessary the motives which detain\r\nyou, I should be deemed inexcusable were I to let such a safe\r\nopportunity as that by Colonel Blackden pass without sending the papers\r\non to London. Mr. Jay complained that a treaty signed in June was not\r\nratified in October. What will they say when they shall observe that\r\nthe same treaty does not reach them till March, nine months? In the\r\nmeantime, our whole commerce is paying a heavy tax for insurance till\r\nits publication. Can you fix a day as early as Monday or Tuesday for\r\nyour departure, whether your baggage arrives or not, or would you\r\nrather decline the going with the papers? In the former case, if your\r\nbaggage does not arrive before your departure, any orders you may think\r\nproper to leave respecting it, shall be punctually executed. I can send\r\nit to Mr. Simonson at Havre, so that it may go to America in the\r\nFebruary packet. I shall see you at the Marquis's to-day, and we will\r\nspeak about this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR OTTO.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 14, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been honored with your letter of October 15, and thank you\r\nfor the intelligence it contained. I am able to make you but an unequal\r\nreturn for it, your friends here being so much more in condition to\r\ncommunicate to you interesting intelligence. With respect to the\r\naffairs of Holland, they do not promise arrangement. The interest which\r\nthe King of Prussia takes in the affairs of the Stadtholder, seem to\r\nthreaten an interruption of his cordiality with the country. The\r\nmisunderstanding between the Kings of Spain and Naples, and a projected\r\nvisit of the latter to Vienna, with the known influence of his Queen\r\nover him, are matter for some jealousy.\r\n\r\nAs to domestic news, the Assembly of Notables occupies all\r\nconversation. What will be the subjects of their deliberation is not\r\nyet declared. The establishment of provincial assemblies, tolerating\r\nthe Protestant religion, removing the internal barriers to the\r\nfrontiers, equalizing the Gabelles, sale of the King's domains, and, in\r\nshort, every other possible reformation, are conjectured by different\r\npersons. I send you a pamphlet on the last Assembly of Notables, from\r\nwhich ideas are formed as to what this will be. Possibly you may\r\nreceive the same from some of your friends. I send you, also, what it\r\nis less likely you should get from them, because it is next to\r\nimpossible to get it at all--that is, a late memoir by Linquet, which\r\nhas produced his perpetual exile from this country. To these I add a\r\nreport written by M. Bailly, on the subject of the Hotel-Dieu of Paris,\r\nwhich has met a very general approbation. These are things for the day\r\nonly. I recollect no work of any dignity which has been lately\r\npublished. We shall very soon receive another volume on Mineralogy from\r\nM. de Buffon; and a third volume of the \"Cultivator Americain\" is in\r\nthe press. So is a History of the American War, by a Monsieur Soules,\r\nthe two first volumes of which, coming down to the capture of Burgoyne,\r\nI have seen, and think better than any I have seen. Mazzei will print\r\nsoon two or three volumes 8vo. of \"Recherches Historiques and\r\nPolitiques sur les Etats Unis d'Amerique,\" which are sensible. We are\r\nflattered with the hopes that the packet boats will hereafter sail\r\nmonthly from Havre, the first being to sail on the 10th of the next\r\nmonth. This is very desirable indeed, as it will furnish more frequent\r\nopportunities of correspondence between the two countries. If I can be\r\nmade useful to you in any line whatever here, it will make me very\r\nhappy. Being with sincere esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LE DUC D'HARCOURT, GOVERNEUR DU DAUPHIN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 14, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the conversation with which you were pleased to honor me, a\r\nfew days ago, on the enfranchisement of the port of Honfleur, I took\r\nthe liberty of observing, that I was not instructed by my constituents\r\nto make any proposition on that subject. That it would be agreeable to\r\nthem, however, I must suppose, because it will offer the following\r\nadvantages:\r\n\r\n1. It is a convenient entrepot for furnishing us with the manufactures\r\nof the northern parts of France, and particularly of Paris, and for\r\nreceiving and distributing the productions of our country in exchange.\r\n\r\n2. Cowes, on the opposite side of the channel, has heretofore been the\r\ndeposit for a considerable part of our productions, landed in Great\r\nBritain in the first instance, but intended for re-exportation. From\r\nthence, our rice, particularly, has been distributed to France and\r\nother parts of Europe. I am not certain whether our tobaccos were\r\ndeposited there, or carried to London to be sorted for the different\r\nmarkets. To draw this business from Cowes, no place is so favorably\r\nsituated as Honfleur.\r\n\r\n3. It would be a convenient deposit for our whale oil, of which, after\r\nthe supply of Paris, there will be a surplus for re-exportation.\r\n\r\n4. Should our fur trade be recovered out of the hands of the English,\r\nit will naturally come to Honfleur, as the port of Paris.\r\n\r\n5. Salt is an important article in all our return cargoes; because,\r\nbeing carried as ballast, its freight costs nothing. But, on account of\r\nsome regulations, with which I am not well acquainted, it cannot, at\r\npresent, be shipped to advantage from any port on the Seine.\r\n\r\n6. Our vessels being built sharp, for swift sailing, suffer extremely\r\nin most of the western ports of France, in which they are left on dry\r\nground at every ebb of the tide. But at Honfleur, I am told, they can\r\nride in bold water, on a good bottom and near the shore at all times.\r\n\r\nThese facts may, perhaps, throw some light on the question in which,\r\nfor the good of both countries, you are pleased to interest yourself. I\r\ntake the liberty, therefore, of barely mentioning them, and with the\r\nmore pleasure, as it furnishes me an occasion of assuring you of those\r\nsentiments of respect and esteem with which I have the honor to be,\r\nyour most obedient, humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE CREVE-COEUR.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 15, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I see by the Journal of this morning, that they are robbing\r\nus of another of our inventions to give it to the English. The writer,\r\nindeed, only admits them to have revived what he thinks was known to\r\nthe Greeks, that is, the making the circumference of a wheel of one\r\nsingle piece. The farmers in New Jersey were the first who practised\r\nit, and they practised it commonly. Dr. Franklin, in one of his trips\r\nto London, mentioned this practice to the man now in London, who has\r\nthe patent for making those wheels. The idea struck him. The Doctor\r\npromised to go to his shop, and assist him in trying to make the wheel\r\nof one piece. The Jersey farmers do it by cutting a young sapling, and\r\nbending it, while green and juicy, into a circle; and leaving it so\r\nuntil it becomes perfectly seasoned. But in London there are no\r\nsaplings. The difficulty was, then, to give to old wood the pliancy of\r\nyoung. The Doctor and the workman labored together some weeks, and\r\nsucceeded; and the man obtained a patent for it, which has made his\r\nfortune. I was in his shop in London, he told me the whole story\r\nhimself, and acknowledged, not only the origin of the idea, but how\r\nmuch the assistance of Dr. Franklin had contributed to perform the\r\noperation on dry wood. He spoke of him with love and gratitude. I think\r\nI have had a similar account from Dr. Franklin, but cannot be quite\r\ncertain. I know, that being in Philadelphia when the first set of\r\npatent wheels arrived from London, and were spoken of by the gentleman\r\n(an Englishman) who brought them, as a wonderful discovery, the idea of\r\nits being a new discovery was laughed at by the Philadelphians, who, in\r\ntheir Sunday parties across the Delaware, had seen every farmer's cart\r\nmounted on such wheels. The writer in the paper, supposes the English\r\nworkman got his idea from Homer. But it is more likely the Jersey\r\nfarmer got his idea from thence, because ours are the only farmers who\r\ncan read Homer; because, too, the Jersey practice is precisely that\r\nstated by Homer: the English practice very different. Homer's words are\r\n(comparing a young hero killed by Ajax to a poplar felled by a workman)\r\nliterally thus: \"He fell on the ground, like a poplar, which has grown\r\nsmooth, in the west part of a great meadow; with its branches shooting\r\nfrom its summit. But the chariot maker, with the sharp axe, has felled\r\nit, that he may bend a wheel for a beautiful chariot. It lies drying on\r\nthe banks of the river.\" Observe the circumstances which coincide with\r\nthe Jersey practice. 1. It is a tree growing in a moist place, full of\r\njuices and easily bent. 2. It is cut while green. 3. It is bent into\r\nthe circumference of a wheel. 4. It is left to dry in that form. You,\r\nwho write French well and readily, should write a line for the Journal,\r\nto reclaim the honor of our farmers. Adieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL EDWARD CARRINGTON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 16, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Uncertain whether you might be at New York at the moment of\r\nColonel Franks' arrival. I have enclosed my private letters for\r\nVirginia under cover to our delegation in general, which otherwise I\r\nwould have taken the liberty to enclose particularly to you, as best\r\nacquainted with the situation of the persons to whom they are\r\naddressed. Should this find you at New York, I will still ask your\r\nattention to them.\r\n\r\nIn my letter to Mr. Jay, I have mentioned the meeting of the Notables,\r\nappointed for the 29th instant. It is now put off to the 7th or 8th of\r\nnext month. This event, which will hardly excite any attention in\r\nAmerica, is deemed here the most important one which has taken place in\r\ntheir civil line during the present century. Some promise their country\r\ngreat things from it, some nothing. Our friend de La Fayette was placed\r\non the list originally. Afterwards his name disappeared, but finally\r\nwas reinstated. This shows that his character here is not considered as\r\nan indifferent one, and that it excites agitation. His education in our\r\nschool has drawn on him a very jealous eye from a court whose\r\nprinciples are the most absolute despotism. But I hope he has nearly\r\npassed his crisis. The King, who is a good man, is favorably disposed\r\ntowards him, and he is supported by powerful family connections and by\r\nthe public good will. He is the youngest man of the Notables except one\r\nwhose office placed him on the list.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Vergennes has within these ten days had a very severe\r\nattack of what is deemed an unfixed gout. He has been well enough,\r\nhowever, to do business to-day. But anxieties for him are not yet\r\nquieted. He is a great and good minister, and an accident to him might\r\nendanger the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe tumults in America I expected would have produced in Europe an\r\nunfavorable opinion of our political state. But it has not. On the\r\ncontrary, the small effect of these tumults seems to have given more\r\nconfidence in the firmness of our governments. The interposition of the\r\npeople themselves on the side of government has had a great effect on\r\nthe opinion here. I am persuaded myself that the good sense of the\r\npeople will always be found to be the best army. They may be led astray\r\nfor a moment, but will soon correct themselves. The people are the only\r\ncensors of their governors; and even their errors will tend to keep\r\nthese to the true principles of their institution. To punish these\r\nerrors too severely would be to suppress the only safeguard of the\r\npublic liberty. The way to prevent these irregular interpositions of\r\nthe people, is to give them full information of their affairs through\r\nthe channel of the public papers, and to contrive that those papers\r\nshould penetrate the whole mass of the people. The basis of our\r\ngovernments being the opinion of the people, the very first object\r\nshould be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether\r\nwe should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a\r\ngovernment, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I\r\nshould mean that every man should receive those papers, and be capable\r\nof reading them. I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians)\r\nwhich live without government, enjoy in their general mass an\r\ninfinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under the\r\nEuropean governments. Among the former, public opinion is in the place\r\nof law, and restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did anywhere.\r\nAmong the latter, under pretence of governing, they have divided their\r\nnations into two classes, wolves and sheep. I do not exaggerate. This\r\nis a true picture of Europe. Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our\r\npeople, and keep alive their attention. Do not be too severe upon their\r\nerrors, but reclaim them by enlightening them. If once they become\r\ninattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and\r\nAssemblies, Judges and Governors, shall all become wolves. It seems to\r\nbe the law of our general nature, in spite of individual exceptions;\r\nand experience declares that man is the only animal which devours his\r\nown kind; for I can apply no milder term to the governments of Europe,\r\nand to the general prey of the rich on the poor. The want of news has\r\nled me into disquisition instead of narration, forgetting you have\r\nevery day enough of that. I shall be happy to hear from you sometimes,\r\nonly observing that whatever passes through the post is read, and that\r\nwhen you write what should be read by myself only, you must be so good\r\nas to confide your letter to some passenger, or officer of the packet.\r\nI will ask your permission to write to you sometimes, and to assure you\r\nof the esteem and respect with which I have honor to be, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DU RIVAL.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 17, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--You were pleased, in behalf of a friend, to ask information of me\r\non the subject of the money of the United States of America, and I had\r\nthe honor of informing you, by letter of November 7, that no\r\nregulations of their coin had then been made by Congress, as far as I\r\nknew. They had, however, entered into resolutions on that subject,\r\nwhich have since come to hand. A translation of these will be found in\r\nthe Leyden Gazette of some few weeks ago. But it will be necessary to\r\nmake the following corrections in the Gazette:\r\n\r\nThe Gazette dates the resolutions October 10; but they were of August\r\n8. It gives only 365.64 grains of pure silver to the dollar; it should\r\nbe 375.64. It states the pound of silver, with its alloy, to be worth\r\n9.99 dollars only, whereas it is fixed at 13.777 dollars; and the pound\r\nof gold, with its alloy, being worth 209.77 dollars, gives the\r\nproportion of silver to gold as 1 to 15.225. These corrections being\r\nmade, the resolutions as stated in the Leyden Gazette may be confided\r\nin.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. S. AND J. H. DELAP.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 17, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I am honored this day by the receipt of your letter of the\r\n6th instant. Having nothing to do with the matters of account of the\r\nUnited States in Europe, it is out of my power to say anything to you\r\nas to the payment of the balance due to you. Yet I think it would be\r\nproper for you to write to the \"Commissioners of the Treasury,\" at New\r\nYork, on this subject. They are the persons who are to pay it; and as\r\ntheir Board has been created since the debt was contracted, they may\r\npossibly need information on the subject.\r\n\r\nAs to your loan office certificates, you would do well to commit them\r\nto some correspondent in America. They will be settled by the table of\r\ndepreciation at their true worth in gold or silver at the time the\r\npaper dollars were lent. On that true value the interest has been paid,\r\nand continues to be paid to the creditors annually in America. That the\r\nprincipal will also be paid, is as sure as any future fact can be. The\r\nepoch is not fixed. It is expected that the State of New York will\r\nshortly accede to the impost which has been proposed. When that shall\r\nbe done, that impost will suffice to pay the interest, and sink the\r\nprincipal in a very few years. I have the honor to be, with much\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. SOULES.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 19, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor of enclosing to you the sheets on the subject of\r\nWyoming. I have had a long conversation with M. Creve-coeur on them. He\r\nknows well that canton. He was in the neighborhood of the place when it\r\nwas destroyed, saw great numbers of the fugitives, aided them with his\r\nwagons, and had the story from all their mouths. He committed notes to\r\nwriting at the moment, which are now in Normandy, at his father's. He\r\nhas written for them, and they will be here in five or six days, when\r\nhe premises to put them into my hands. He says there will be a great\r\ndeal to alter in your narration, and that it must assume a different\r\nface, more favorable both to the British and Indians. His veracity may\r\nbe relied on, and I told him I was sure your object was truth; and, to\r\nrender your work estimable by that character, that I thought you would\r\nwait, and readily make any changes upon evidence which should be\r\nsatisfactory to you. The moment I receive his notes I will communicate\r\nthem to you, and have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. HILLIARD D'AUBERTEUIL.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 27, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I duly received the letter you did me the honor to write, and the\r\nverses therein enclosed on the subject of M. de La Fayette. I have\r\ntaken measures to present the public with this acceptable present; but\r\nthe newspapers here are slow in complying with the applications\r\naddressed to them. It is not for a stranger to decide on the merits of\r\npoetry in a language foreign to him. Were I to presume to do it in this\r\ninstance, I should certainly assign to this composition a high degree\r\nof approbation.\r\n\r\nI wish it were in my power to furnish you with any materials for the\r\nhistory on which you are engaged, but I brought no papers of that kind\r\nwith me from America. In a letter you did me the honor of writing me\r\nsometime ago, you seemed to suppose, you might go to America in quest\r\nof materials. Should you execute this idea, I should with great\r\npleasure give any assistance in my power to obtain access for you to\r\nthe several deposits of materials which are in that country. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHEVALIER DE SEGOND.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 27, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received the letter with which you have been pleased\r\nto honor me, complaining of the non-payment of interest on the sum due\r\nto you from the United States. I feel with great sensibility the weight\r\nof these complaints; but it is neither in my province, nor in my power,\r\nto remedy them. I am noways authorized to interfere with the money\r\nmatters of the United States in Europe. These rest altogether between\r\nthe Commissioners of the Treasury of the United States at New York and\r\ntheir bankers in Europe. Being informed, however, from Mr. Grand, that\r\nthe funds appropriated to the payment of the foreign officers were\r\nexhausted, I took the liberty of representing strongly to the\r\nCommissioners the motives which should urge them to furnish new\r\nsupplies. They assured me, in answer, that they would do it at the\r\nfirst moment it should be in their power. I am perfectly persuaded they\r\nwill; however, I shall immediately forward to them the letter you have\r\nbeen pleased to address to me; and will observe to you, that it is to\r\nthem alone, or to Congress, to whom you can make any future\r\napplications with effect.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.[2]\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 30, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of the 16th of December; since which, I\r\nhave received yours of November the 25th, and December the 4th, which\r\nafforded me, as your letters always do, a treat on matters public,\r\nindividual and economical. I am impatient to learn your sentiments on\r\nthe late troubles in the Eastern States. So far as I have yet seen,\r\nthey do not appear to threaten serious consequences. Those States have\r\nsuffered by the stoppage of the channels of their commerce, which have\r\nnot yet found other issues. This must render money scarce, and make the\r\npeople uneasy. This uneasiness has produced acts absolutely\r\nunjustifiable; but I hope they will provoke no severities from their\r\ngovernments. A consciousness of those in power that their\r\nadministration of the public affairs has been honest, may perhaps,\r\nproduce too great a degree of indignation; and those characters,\r\nwherein fear predominates over hope, may apprehend too much from these\r\ninstances of irregularity. They may conclude too hastily, that nature\r\nhas formed man insusceptible of any other government than that of\r\nforce, a conclusion not founded in truth nor experience. Societies\r\nexist under three forms, sufficiently distinguishable. 1. Without\r\ngovernment, as among our Indians. 2. Under governments, wherein the\r\nwill of every one has a just influence; as is the case in England, in a\r\nslight degree, and in our States, in a great one. 3. Under governments\r\nof force; as is the case in all other monarchies, and in most of the\r\nother republics. To have an idea of the curse of existence under these\r\nlast, they must be seen. It is a government of wolves over sheep. It is\r\na problem, not clear in my mind, that the first condition is not the\r\nbest. But I believe it to be inconsistent with any great degree of\r\npopulation. The second state has a great deal of good in it. The mass\r\nof mankind under that, enjoys a precious degree of liberty and\r\nhappiness. It has its evils, too; the principal of which is the\r\nturbulence to which it is subject. But weigh this against the\r\noppressions of monarchy, and it becomes nothing. _Malo periculosam\r\nlibertatem quam quietam servitutem._ Even this evil is productive of\r\ngood. It prevents the degeneracy of government, and nourishes a general\r\nattention to the public affairs. I hold it, that a little rebellion,\r\nnow and then, is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world\r\nas storms in the physical. Unsuccessful rebellions, indeed, generally\r\nestablish the encroachments on the rights of the people, which have\r\nproduced them. An observation of this truth should render honest\r\nrepublican governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions, as not\r\nto discourage them too much. It is a medicine necessary for the sound\r\nhealth of government.\r\n\r\n      [2] The latter part of this letter is in cypher; but appended to\r\n      the copy preserved, are explanatory notes, which have enabled us\r\n      to publish it entire, except a few words, to which they afford no\r\n      key. These are either marked thus * * *, or the words which the\r\n      context seemed to require, inserted in italics.\r\n\r\nIf these transactions give me no uneasiness, I feel very differently at\r\nanother piece of intelligence, to wit, the possibility that the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi may be abandoned to Spain. I never had\r\nany interest westward of the Alleghany; and I never will have any. But\r\nI have had great opportunities of knowing the character of the people\r\nwho inhabit that country; and I will venture to say, that the act which\r\nabandons the navigation of the Mississippi is an act of separation\r\nbetween the eastern and western country. It is a relinquishment of five\r\nparts out of eight, of the territory of the United States; an\r\nabandonment of the fairest subject for the payment of our public debts,\r\nand the chaining those debts on our own necks, _in perpetuum_. I have\r\nthe utmost confidence in the honest intentions of those who concur in\r\nthis measure; but I lament their want of acquaintance with the\r\ncharacter and physical advantages of the people, who, right or wrong,\r\nwill suppose their interest sacrificed on this occasion, to the\r\ncontrary interests of that part of the confederacy in possession of\r\npresent power. If they declare themselves a separate people, we are\r\nincapable of a single effort to retain them. Our citizens can never be\r\ninduced, either as militia or as soldiers, to go there to cut the\r\nthroats of their own brothers and sons, or rather, to be themselves the\r\nsubjects, instead of the perpetrators of the parricide. Nor would that\r\ncountry quit the cost of being retained against the will of its\r\ninhabitants, could it be done. But it cannot be done. They are able\r\nalready to rescue the navigation of the Mississippi out of the hands of\r\nSpain, and to add New Orleans to their own territory. They will be\r\njoined by the inhabitants of Louisiana. This will bring on a war\r\nbetween them and Spain; and that will produce the question with us,\r\nwhether it will not be worth our while to become parties with them in\r\nthe war, in order to re-unite them with us, and thus correct our error?\r\nAnd were I to permit my forebodings to go one step further, I should\r\npredict that the inhabitants of the United States would force their\r\nrulers to take the affirmative of that question. I wish I may be\r\nmistaken in all these opinions.\r\n\r\nWe have, for some time, expected that the Chevalier de La Luzerne would\r\nobtain a promotion in the diplomatic line, by being appointed to some\r\nof the courts where this country keeps an ambassador. But none of the\r\nvacancies taking place, which had been counted on, I think the present\r\ndisposition is, to require his return to his station in America. He\r\ntold me himself, lately, that he should return in the spring. I have\r\nnever pressed this matter on the court, though I knew it to be\r\ndesirable and desired on our part; because, if the compulsion on him to\r\nreturn had been the work of Congress, he would have returned in such\r\nill temper with them, as to disappoint them in the good they expected\r\nfrom it. He would forever have laid at their door his failure of\r\npromotion. I did not press it for another reason, which is, that I have\r\ngreat reason to believe that the character of the Count de Moutier, who\r\nwould go, were the Chevalier to be otherwise provided for, would give\r\nthe most perfect satisfaction in America.\r\n\r\nAs you have now returned into Congress, it will become of importance\r\nthat you should form a just estimate of certain public characters: on\r\nwhich, therefore, I will give you such notes, as my knowledge of them\r\nhas furnished me with. You will compare them with the materials you are\r\notherwise possessed of, and decide on a view of the whole.\r\n\r\nYou know the opinion I formerly entertained of my friend, Mr. Adams.\r\n * * * and the Governor were the first who shook that opinion. I\r\nafterwards saw proofs which convicted him of a degree of vanity, and of\r\na blindness to it, of which no germ appeared in Congress. A seven\r\nmonths' intimacy with him here, and as many weeks in London, have given\r\nme opportunities of studying him closely. He is vain, irritable, and a\r\nbad calculator of the force and probable effect of the motives which\r\ngovern men. This is all the ill which can possibly be said of him. He\r\nis as disinterested as the being who made him: he is profound in his\r\nviews; and accurate in his judgment, except where knowledge of the\r\nworld is necessary to form a judgment. He is so amiable, that I\r\npronounce you will love him, if ever you become acquainted with him. He\r\nwould be, as he was, a great man in Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. Carmichael is, I think, very little known in America. I never saw\r\nhim, and while I was in Congress I formed rather a disadvantageous idea\r\nof him. His letters, received then, showed him vain, and more attentive\r\nto ceremony and etiquette, than we suppose men of sense should be. I\r\nhave now a constant correspondence with him, and find him a little\r\nhypochondriac and discontented. He possesses a very good understanding,\r\nthough not of the first order. I have had great opportunities of\r\nsearching into his character, and have availed myself of them. Many\r\npersons of different nations, coming from Madrid to Paris, all speak of\r\nhim as in high esteem, and I think it certain that he has more of the\r\nCount de Florida Blanca's friendship, than any diplomatic character at\r\nthat court. As long as this minister is in office, Carmichael can do\r\nmore than any other person who could be sent there.\r\n\r\nYou will see Franks, and doubtless he will be asking some appointment.\r\nI wish there may be any one for which he is fit. He is light,\r\nindiscreet, active, honest, affectionate. Though Bingham is not in\r\ndiplomatic office, yet as he wishes to be so, I will mention such\r\ncircumstances of him, as you might otherwise be deceived in. He will\r\nmake you believe he was on the most intimate footing with the first\r\ncharacters in Europe, and versed in the secrets of every cabinet. Not a\r\nword of this is true. He had a rage for being presented to great men,\r\nand had no * * * in the methods by which he could effect it. * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de La Fayette is a most valuable auxiliary to me. His zeal\r\nis unbounded, and his weight with those in power, great. His education\r\nhaving been merely military, commerce was an unknown field to him. But\r\nhis good sense enabling him to comprehend perfectly whatever is\r\nexplained to him, his agency has been very efficacious. He has a great\r\ndeal of sound genius, is well remarked by the King, and rising in\r\npopularity. He has nothing against him, but the suspicion of republican\r\nprinciples. I think he will one day be of the ministry. His foible is,\r\na canine appetite for popularity and fame; but he will get above this.\r\n_The Count de Vergennes_ is _ill_. The possibility of his _recovery_,\r\nrenders it dangerous for us to express a doubt of it; but he is in\r\ndanger. He is a great minister in European affairs, but has very\r\nimperfect ideas of our _institutions_, and no confidence in them. His\r\ndevotion to the principles of pure despotism, renders him\r\nunaffectionate to our governments. But his fear of England makes him\r\nvalue us as a make weight. He is cool, reserved in political\r\nconversations, but free and familiar on other subjects, and a very\r\nattentive, agreeable person to do business with. It is impossible to\r\nhave a clearer, better organized head; but age has chilled his heart.\r\n\r\nNothing should be spared, on our part, to attach this country to us. It\r\nis the only one on which we can rely for support, under every event.\r\nIts inhabitants love us more, I think, than they do any other nation on\r\nearth. This is very much the effect of the good dispositions with which\r\nthe French officers returned. In a former letter, I mentioned to you\r\nthe dislocation of my wrist. I can make not the least use of it, except\r\nfor the single article of writing, though it is going on five months\r\nsince the accident happened. I have great anxieties, lest I should\r\nnever recover any considerable use of it. I shall, by the advice of my\r\nsurgeons, set out in a fortnight for the waters of Aix, in Provence. I\r\nchose these out of several they proposed to me, because if they fail to\r\nbe effectual, my journey will not be useless altogether. It will give\r\nme an opportunity of examining the canal of Languedoc, and of acquiring\r\nknowledge of that species of navigation, which may be useful hereafter;\r\nbut more immediately, it will enable me to make the tour of the ports\r\nconcerned in commerce with us, to examine, on the spot, the defects of\r\nthe late regulations respecting our commerce, to learn the further\r\nimprovements which may be made in it, and on my return, to get this\r\nbusiness finished. I shall be absent between two and three months,\r\nunless anything happens to recall me here sooner, which may always be\r\neffected in ten days, in whatever part of my route I may be.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of characters, I omitted those of Reyneval and Hennin, the\r\ntwo eyes of Count de Vergennes. The former is the most important\r\ncharacter, because possessing the most of the confidence of the Count.\r\nHe is rather cunning than wise, his views of things being neither great\r\nnor liberal. He governs himself by principles which he has learned by\r\nrote, and is fit only for the details of execution. His heart is\r\nsusceptible of little passions, but not of good ones. He is\r\nbrother-in-law to M. Gerard, from whom he received disadvantageous\r\nimpressions of us, which cannot be effaced. He has much duplicity.\r\nHennin is a philosopher, sincere, friendly, liberal, learned, beloved\r\nby everybody; the other by nobody. I think it a great misfortune that\r\nthe United States are in the department of the former. As particulars\r\nof this kind may be useful to you, in your present situation, I may\r\nhereafter continue the chapter. I know it will be safely lodged in your\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nFeb. 5. Since writing thus far, Franks has returned from England. I\r\nlearn that Mr. Adams desires to be recalled, and that Smith should be\r\nappointed Charge des Affaires there. It is not for me to decide whether\r\nany diplomatic character should be kept at a court, which keeps none\r\nwith us. You can judge of Smith's abilities by his letters. They are\r\nnot of the first order, but they are good. For his honesty, he is like\r\nour friend Monroe; turn his soul wrong side outwards, and there is not\r\na speck on it. He has one foible, an excessive inflammability of\r\ntemper, but he feels it when it comes on, and has resolution enough to\r\nsuppress it, and to remain silent till it passes over.\r\n\r\nI send you, by Colonel Franks, your pocket telescope, walking stick and\r\nchemical box. The two former could not be combined together. The latter\r\ncould not be had in the form you referred to. Having a great desire to\r\nhave a portable copying machine, and being satisfied, from some\r\nexperiments, that the principle of the large machine might be applied\r\nin a small one, I planned one when in England, and had it made. It\r\nanswers perfectly. I have since set a workman to making them here, and\r\nthey are in such demand that he has his hands full. Being assured that\r\nyou will be pleased to have one, when you shall have tried its\r\nconvenience, I send you one by Colonel Franks. The machine costs\r\nninety-six livres, the appendages twenty-four livres, and I send you\r\npaper and ink for twelve livres; in all, one hundred and thirty-two\r\nlivres. There is a printed paper of directions; but you must expect to\r\nmake many essays before you succeed perfectly. A soft brush, like a\r\nshaving brush, is more convenient than the sponge. You can get as much\r\nink and paper as you please from London. The paper costs a guinea a\r\nream. I am, dear Sir, with sincere esteem and affection, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 1, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last letters were of the 31st of December, and 9th of January;\r\nsince which last date, I have been honored with yours of December the\r\n13th and 14th. I shall pay immediate attention to your instructions\r\nrelative to the South Carolina frigate. I had the honor of informing\r\nyou of an improvement in the art of coining, made here by one Drost,\r\nand of sending you, by Colonel Franks, a specimen of his execution in\r\ngold and silver. I expected to have sent also a coin of copper. The\r\nenclosed note from Drost will explain the reason why this was not sent.\r\nIt will let you see also, that he may be employed; as I suppose he is\r\nnot so certain as he was of being engaged here. Mr. Grand, who knows\r\nhim, gives me reason to believe he may be engaged reasonably. Congress\r\nwill decide whether it be worth their attention.\r\n\r\nIn some of my former letters, I suggested an opportunity of obliging\r\nthis court, by borrowing as much money in Holland as would pay the debt\r\ndue here, if such a loan could be obtained; as to which, I was\r\naltogether ignorant. To save time, I wrote to Mr. Dumas, to know\r\nwhether he thought it probable a loan could be obtained, enjoining on\r\nhim the strictest secrecy, and informing him I was making the inquiry\r\nmerely of my own motion, and without instruction. I enclose you his\r\nanswer. He thinks purchasers of the debt could be found, with a\r\nsacrifice of a small part of the capital, and a postponement be\r\nobtained of some of the first reimbursements. The proposition by him,\r\nfor an immediate adoption of this measure by me, was probably urged on\r\nhis mind by a desire to serve our country, more than a strict attention\r\nto my duty, and the magnitude of the object. I hope, on the contrary,\r\nthat if it should be thought worth a trial, it may be put into the\r\nhands of Mr. Adams, who knows the ground, and is known there, and whose\r\nformer successful negotiations in this line, would give better-founded\r\nhopes of success on this occasion.\r\n\r\nI formerly mentioned to you the hopes of preferment, entertained by the\r\nChevalier de La Luzerne. They have been baffled by events; none of the\r\nvacancies taking place which had been expected. Had I pressed his being\r\nordered back, I have reason to believe the order would have been given.\r\nBut he would have gone back in ill humor with Congress, he would have\r\nlaid forever at their door the failure of a promotion then viewed as\r\ncertain; and this might have excited dispositions that would have\r\ndisappointed us of the good we hoped from his return. The line I have\r\nobserved with him has been, to make him sensible that nothing was more\r\ndesired by Congress than his return, but that they would not willingly\r\npress it, so as to defeat him of a personal advantage. He sees his\r\nprospects fail, and will return in the approaching spring, unless\r\nsomething unexpected should turn up in his favor. In this case, the\r\nCount de Moutier has the promise of succeeding to him, and, if I do not\r\nmistake his character, he would give great satisfaction. So that I\r\nthink you may calculate on seeing one or the other, by midsummer.\r\n\r\nIt had been suspected that France and England might adopt those\r\nconcerted regulations of commerce for their West Indies, of which your\r\nletter expresses some apprehensions. But the expressions in the 4th,\r\n5th, 7th, 11th, 18th, and other articles of their treaty, which\r\ncommunicate to the English the privileges of the most favored\r\n_European_ nation only, has lessened, if not removed those fears. They\r\nhave clearly reserved a right of favoring, specially, any nation not\r\nEuropean; and there is no nation out of Europe, who could so probably\r\nhave been in their eye at that time, as ours. They are wise. They must\r\nsee it probable, at least, that any concert with England, will be but\r\nof short duration; and they could hardly propose to sacrifice for that,\r\na connection with us, which may be perpetual.\r\n\r\nWe have been for some days in much inquietude for the Count de\r\nVergennes. He is very seriously ill. Nature seems struggling to decide\r\nhis disease into a gout. A swelled foot, at present, gives us a hope of\r\nthis issue. His loss would at all times have been great; but it would\r\nbe immense during the critical poise of European affairs existing at\r\nthis moment. I enclose you a letter from one of the foreign officers,\r\ncomplaining of the non-payment of their interest. It is only one out of\r\nmany I have received. This is accompanied by a second copy of the\r\nMoorish declaration sent me by Mr. Barclay. He went to Alicant to\r\nsettle with Mr. Lambe; but on his arrival there, found he was gone to\r\nMinorca. A copy of his letter will inform you of this circumstance, and\r\nof some others relative to Algiers, with his opinion on them. Whatever\r\nthe States may enable Congress to do for obtaining the peace of that\r\ncountry, it is a separate question whether they will redeem our\r\ncaptives, how, and at what price. If they decide to redeem them, I will\r\nbeg leave to observe, that it is of great importance that the first\r\nredemption be made at as low a price as possible, because it will form\r\nthe future tariff. If these pirates find that they can have a very\r\ngreat price for Americans, they will abandon proportionably their\r\npursuits against other nations, to direct them towards ours. That the\r\nchoice of Congress may be enlarged, as to the instruments they may use\r\nfor effecting the redemption, I think it my duty to inform them, that\r\nthere is here an order of priests called the Mathurins, the object of\r\nwhose institution is to beg alms for the redemption of captives. They\r\nkeep members always in Barbary, searching out the captives of their\r\ncountry, and redeem, I believe, on better terms than any other body,\r\npublic or private. It occurred to me, that their agency might be\r\nobtained for the redemption of our prisoners at Algiers. I obtained\r\nconference with the General, and with some members of the order. The\r\nGeneral, with all the benevolence and cordiality possible, undertook to\r\nact for us, if we should desire it. He told me that their last\r\nconsiderable redemption was of about three hundred prisoners, who cost\r\nthem somewhat upwards of fifteen hundred livres apiece; but that they\r\nshould not be able to redeem ours as cheap as they do their own; and\r\nthat it must be absolutely unknown that the public concern themselves\r\nin the operation, or the price would be greatly enhanced. The\r\ndifference of religion was not once mentioned, nor did it appear to me\r\nto be thought of. It was a silent reclamation and acknowledgment of\r\nfraternity, between two religions of the same family, which historical\r\nevents of ancient date had rendered more hostile to one another, than\r\nto their common adversaries. I informed the General, that I should\r\ncommunicate the good dispositions of his order to those who alone had\r\nthe authority to decide whatever related to our captives. Mr.\r\nCarmichael informs me, that moneys have been advanced for the support\r\nof our prisoners at Algiers, which ought to be replaced. I infer from\r\nthe context of his letter, that these advances have been made by the\r\ncourt of Madrid. I submit the information to Congress.\r\n\r\nA treaty of commerce is certainly concluded between France and Russia.\r\nThe particulars of it are yet secret.\r\n\r\nI enclose the gazettes of France and Leyden to this time, and have the\r\nhonor of assuring you of those sentiments of perfect esteem and respect\r\nwith which I am, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. SOULES.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I send you the papers M. de Creve-coeur sent to Normandy for. The\r\naccount of the destruction of Wyoming begins page 40. You may rely\r\ncertainly on the author's facts, and you will be easily able to\r\nseparate from them his reflections. You can best judge whether an\r\naccount of that interesting settlement, condensed into a few lines,\r\nmight not form an agreeable episode in your history, and prepare the\r\nmind more awfully for its final catastrophe. I will thank you to return\r\nthese papers as soon as you are done with them, that I may restore them\r\nto the hands of M. de Creve-coeur before my departure, which will now\r\nbe in a few days. I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 6, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favors by Colonel Franks have come safely to hand. He\r\nwill set out from thence the 8th instant. The packet being to sail from\r\nHavre the 10th, I enclose you the copy of a letter lately received from\r\nMr. Barclay, and of the paper it enclosed. In a letter from Mr.\r\nCarmichael, is a postscript, dated December 25, in the following words:\r\n\"Since writing the preceding, the Portuguese Ambassador has pressed me\r\nto hint, that the present moment is favorable to push our treaty with\r\nthe court.\" In the body of the letter he says: \"The Count de Expilly\r\nhas promised me to continue his attention to our prisoners during his\r\nstay at Algiers; and I have also engaged the Consul of Spain, who\r\nremains there on his return, to take care of them. Advances have been\r\nmade for their support which ought to be refunded.\" I suppose these\r\nadvances have been made by order of Mr. Lambe, and that his powers\r\nbeing at an end, it will be incumbent on us to take measures on that\r\nsubject. The Count de Vergennes is extremely ill. His disease is gouty.\r\nWe have for some days had hopes it would fix itself decidedly in the\r\nfoot. It shows itself there at times, as also in the shoulder, the\r\nstomach, &c. Monsieur de Calonne is likewise ill, but his complaints\r\nare of a rheumatic kind, which he has often had before. The illness of\r\nthese two ministers occasioned the postponement of the Assembly of the\r\nNotables to the 14th, and probably will yet postpone it. Nothing is yet\r\nknown of the objects of that meeting. I send you a pamphlet giving a\r\nsummary account of all the meetings of a general nature which have\r\ntaken place heretofore. The treaty between Prussia and this country is\r\ncertainly concluded, but its contents are not yet known. I shall set\r\nout for the waters of Aix on the 13th instant, so that I am unable to\r\nsay when and whence I shall have the honor of addressing you again. But\r\nI take measures for the conveying to me on my road all letters, so that\r\nshould anything extraordinary require it, I can at all times be\r\nrecalled to Paris in a fortnight. I shall hope to hear from you at\r\ntimes, as if I were in Paris. I thank you much for the valuable present\r\nof your book. The subject of it is interesting, and I am sure it is\r\nwell treated. I shall take it on my journey, that I may have time to\r\nstudy it. You told me once, you had thought of writing on hereditary\r\naristocracy. I wish you would carry it into execution. It would make a\r\nproper sequel to the present work. I wish you all possible happiness,\r\nand have the honor to be, with sentiments of sincere esteem and\r\naffection, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BINGHAM.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 7, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know, Madam, that the twelve month is not yet expired; but it will\r\nbe, nearly, before this will have the honor of being put into your\r\nhands. You are then engaged to tell me, truly and honestly, whether you\r\ndo not find the tranquil pleasures of America, preferable to the empty\r\nbustle of Paris. For, to what does that bustle tend? At eleven o'clock,\r\nit is day, _chez madame_. The curtains are drawn. Propped on bolsters\r\nand pillows, and her head scratched into a little order, the bulletins\r\nof the sick are read, and the billets of the well. She writes to some\r\nof her acquaintance, and receives the visits of others. If the morning\r\nis not very thronged, she is able to get out and hobble round the cage\r\nof the Palais Royal; but she must hobble quickly, for the _coiffeur's_\r\nturn is come; and a tremendous turn it is! Happy, if he does not make\r\nher arrive when dinner is half over! The torpitude of digestion a\r\nlittle passed, she flutters half an hour through the streets, by way of\r\npaying visits, and then to the spectacles. These finished, another half\r\nhour is devoted to dodging in and out of the doors of her very sincere\r\nfriends, and away to supper. After supper, cards; and after cards, bed;\r\nto rise at noon the next day, and to tread, like a mill horse, the same\r\ntrodden circle over again. Thus the days of life are consumed, one by\r\none, without an object beyond the present moment; ever flying from the\r\nennui of that, yet carrying it with us; eternally in pursuit of\r\nhappiness, which keeps eternally before us. If death or bankruptcy\r\nhappen to trip us out of the circle, it is matter for the buzz of the\r\nevening, and is completely forgotten by the next morning. In America,\r\non the other hand, the society of your husband, the fond cares for the\r\nchildren, the arrangements of the house, the improvements of the\r\ngrounds, fill every moment with a healthy and an useful activity. Every\r\nexertion is encouraging, because, to present amusement, it joins the\r\npromise of some future good. The intervals of leisure are filled by the\r\nsociety of real friends, whose affections are not thinned to cob-web,\r\nby being spread over a thousand objects. This is the picture, in the\r\nlight it is presented to my mind; now let me have it in yours. If we do\r\nnot concur this year, we shall the next; or if not then, in a year or\r\ntwo more. You see I am determined not to suppose myself mistaken.\r\n\r\nTo let you see that Paris is not changed in its pursuits, since it was\r\nhonored with your presence, I send you its monthly history. But this\r\nrelating only to the embellishments of their persons, I must add, that\r\nthose of the city go on well also. A new bridge, for example, is begun\r\nat the Place Louis Quinze; the old ones are clearing off the rubbish\r\nwhich encumbered them in the form of houses; new hospitals erecting;\r\nmagnificent walls of inclosure, and Custom-houses at their entrances,\r\n&c., &c., &c. I know of no interesting change among those whom you\r\nhonored with your acquaintance, unless Monsieur de Saint James was of\r\nthat number. His bankruptcy, and taking asylum in the Bastile, have\r\nfurnished matter of astonishment. His garden, at the Pont de Neuilly,\r\nwhere, on seventeen acres of ground, he had laid out fifty thousand\r\nlouis, will probably sell for somewhat less money. The workmen of Paris\r\nare making rapid strides towards English perfection. Would you believe,\r\nthat in the course of the last two years, they have learned even to\r\nsurpass their London rivals in some articles? Commission me to have you\r\na phaeton made, and, if it is not as much handsomer than a London one,\r\nas that is than a _Fiacre_, send it back to me. Shall I fill the box\r\nwith caps, bonnets, &c.? Not of my own choosing, but--I was going to\r\nsay, of Mademoiselle Bertin's, forgetting, for the moment, that she too\r\nis a bankrupt. They shall be chosen then by whom you please; or, if you\r\nare altogether nonplused by her eclipse, we will call an _Assemblee des\r\nNotables_ to help you out of the difficulty, as is now the fashion. In\r\nshort, honor me with your commands of any kind, and they shall be\r\nfaithfully executed. The packets now established from Havre to New\r\nYork, furnish good opportunities of sending whatever you wish.\r\n\r\nI shall end where I began, like a Paris day, reminding you of your\r\nengagement to write me a letter of respectable length, an engagement\r\nthe more precious to me, as it has furnished the occasion, after\r\npresenting my respects to Mr. Bingham, of assuring you of the sincerity\r\nof those sentiments of esteem and respect with which I have the honor\r\nto be, dear Madam, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 7, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor of enclosing to your Excellency, a report of the\r\nproceedings on the inauguration of the bust of the Marquis de La\r\nFayette in this city. This has been attended with a considerable, but a\r\nnecessary delay. The principle that the King is the sole fountain of\r\nhonor in this country opposed a barrier to our desires, which\r\nthreatened to be insurmountable. No instance of a similar proposition\r\nfrom a foreign power, had occurred in their history. The admitting it\r\nin this case, is a singular proof of the King's friendly disposition\r\ntowards the States of America, and of his personal esteem for the\r\nMarquis de La Fayette.\r\n\r\nI take this, the earliest occasion, of congratulating my country on\r\nyour Excellency's appointment to the chair of government, and of\r\nassuring you with great sincerity, of those sentiments of perfect\r\nesteem and respect, with which I have the honor to be, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 8, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--The packet being to sail the day after tomorrow, I have awaited\r\nthe last possible moment of writing by her, in hopes I might be able to\r\nannounce some favorable change in the situation of the Count de\r\nVergennes. But none has occurred, and in the meantime he has become\r\nweaker by the continuance of his illness. Though not desperately ill,\r\nhe is dangerously so. The Comptroller General, M. de Calonnes, has been\r\nvery ill also, but he is getting well. These circumstances have\r\noccasioned the postponement of the Assemblee des Notables to the 14th\r\ninstant, and will probably occasion a further postponement. As I shall\r\nset out this day sennight for the waters of Aix, you will probably hear\r\nthe issue of the Count de Vergennes' illness through some other\r\nchannel, before I shall have the honor of addressing you again. I may\r\nobserve the same, as to the final decision for the _effranchisement_ of\r\nHonfleur, which is in a fair way of being speedily concluded. The\r\nexertions of Monsieur de Creve-coeur, and particularly his influence\r\nwith the Duke d'Harcourt, the principal instrument in effecting it,\r\nhave been of chief consequence in this matter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last to you was dated December 25th; since which I have been\r\nhonored with your several favors of December the 29th, January the 5th,\r\n9th and 23d. I thought that your affairs could not be more interesting\r\nthan they have been for a considerable time. Yet in the present moment\r\nthey are become more so, by the apparent withdrawing of so considerable\r\na personage in the drama, as the King of Prussia. To increase this\r\ninterest, another person, whose importance scarcely admits calculation,\r\nis in a situation which fills us with alarm. Nature is struggling to\r\nrelieve him by a decided gout; she has my sincere prayers to aid her,\r\nas I am persuaded she has yours. I have letters and papers from\r\nAmerica, as late as the 15th of December. The government of\r\nMassachusetts had imprisoned three of the leaders of their insurgents.\r\nThe insurgents, being collected to the number of three or four hundred,\r\nhad sent in their petition to the government, praying another act of\r\npardon for their leaders and themselves, and, on this condition,\r\noffering to go every man home, and conduct himself dutifully\r\nafterwards. This is the latest intelligence.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your attention to the question I had taken the liberty\r\nof proposing to you. I think with you, that it would be advisable to\r\nhave our debt transferred to individuals of your country. There could,\r\nand would be no objection to the guarantee remaining as you propose;\r\nand a postponement of the first payments of capital, would surely be a\r\nconvenience to us. For though the resources of the United States are\r\ngreat and growing, and their dispositions good, yet their machine is\r\nnew, and they have not got it to go well. It is the object of their\r\ngeneral wish at present, and they are all in movement, to set it in a\r\ngood train; but their movements are necessarily slow. They will surely\r\neffect it in the end, because all have the same end in view; the\r\ndifficulty being only to get all the thirteen States to agree on the\r\nsame means. Divesting myself of every partiality, and speaking from\r\nthat thorough knowledge which I have of the country, their resources\r\nand their principles, I had rather trust money in their hands, than in\r\nthat of any government on earth; because, though for awhile the\r\npayments of the interest might be less regular, yet the final\r\nreimbursement of the capital would be more sure.\r\n\r\nI set out next week for the south of France, to try whether some\r\nmineral waters in that quarter, much recommended, will restore the use\r\nof my hand. I shall be absent from Paris two or three months; but I\r\ntake arrangements for the regular receipt of your favors, as if I were\r\nhere. It will be better, however, for you to put your letters to Mr.\r\nJay, under cover to Mr. Short, who remains here, and will forward them.\r\n\r\nI have thought it my duty to submit to Congress the proposition about\r\nthe French debt, and may expect their answer in four months.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sincere esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. BORGNIS DESBORDES FRERES.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 12, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--Mr. Barclay, the American Consul General for France, being\r\nat present out of the kingdom, I have given orders to Mr. Grand, banker\r\nat Paris, to pay your draught for one hundred and eighty-six livres,\r\nadvanced by you for the relief of the shipwrecked Americans. I thank\r\nyou for your attention to these unfortunate people. It will rest with\r\nMr. Barclay to give such future directions as he shall think proper for\r\ncases of this kind, which properly fall within the consular department.\r\nA certainty that your kindness will meet his thanks, and that my\r\ninterference in his absence will be approved, has engaged me to do it\r\nwithout any hesitation. I am just setting out on a journey of two or\r\nthree months, but Mr. Grand, as I have before mentioned, will pay your\r\ndraught for the 168 livres whenever you shall be pleased to make it. I\r\nhave the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 14, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As I propose to write you on business by Mr. Cairnes, who\r\nwill set out in a few days for London, the object of the present letter\r\nis only to inform you that the Count de Vergennes died yesterday\r\nmorning, and that the Count de Montmorin is appointed his successor,\r\nand further to beg the favor of you to forward the enclosed by the\r\nfirst vessel from London. I set out on my journey on Sunday the 18th. I\r\nhave the honor to be, with sentiments of very sincere affection and\r\nrespect, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 14, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the letter of the 8th instant, which I had the honor of\r\nwriting you, I informed you that the Count de Vergennes was dangerously\r\nill. He died yesterday morning, and the Count de Montmorin is appointed\r\nhis successor. Your personal knowledge of this gentleman, renders it\r\nunnecessary for me to say anything of him.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris, during his office, being authorized to have the medals and\r\nswords executed, which had been ordered by Congress, he authorized\r\nColonel Humphreys to take measures here for the execution. Colonel\r\nHumphreys did so; and the swords were finished in time for him to carry\r\nthem. The medals not being finished, he desired me to attend to them.\r\nThe workman who was to make that of General Greene, brought me\r\nyesterday, the medal in gold, twenty-three in copper, and the dye. Mr.\r\nShort, during my absence, will avail himself of the first occasion\r\nwhich shall offer, of forwarding the medals to you. I must beg leave,\r\nthrough you, to ask the pleasure of Congress as to the number they\r\nwould choose to have struck. Perhaps they might be willing to deposit\r\none of each person, in every college of the United States. Perhaps they\r\nmight choose to give a series of them, to each of the crowned heads of\r\nEurope, which would be an acceptable present to them. They will be\r\npleased to decide. In the meantime, I have sealed up the dye, and shall\r\nretain it till I am honored with their orders as to this medal, and the\r\nothers also, when they shall be finished.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LE PREVOT DES MARCHANDS ET ECHEVINS DE PARIS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 18, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of the letter with which you\r\nhave been pleased to honor me, together with the report on the\r\ninauguration of the bust of the Major General the Marquis de La\r\nFayette. I availed myself of an opportunity which offered in the\r\nmoment, of transmitting them to the State of Virginia, with a faithful\r\nrepresentation of the favor with which the Prevot des Marchands et\r\nEchevins de Paris received their proposition, the zeal with which it\r\nwas pursued, and the dignity of its ultimate execution. Knowing the\r\nattachment of my country to the character which was the subject of that\r\ntransaction, and the price they will set on the attentions of the\r\nmagistracy of Paris, I am safe in assuring you that they will feel\r\nthemselves infinitely obliged on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe interest you are pleased to take in the happiness of our infant\r\nStates, your judicious admonitions as to the means of preserving it,\r\nand the terms in which you particularly honor some of their members,\r\nrequire my personal thanks, which I humbly offer, with all those\r\nsentiments of homage and respect with which I have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 18, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was dated December 26, since which I have\r\nbeen honored with yours of December 17. I now enclose you a duplicate\r\nof the vote for the recall of Mr. Lambe. I take the liberty, also, of\r\nputting under cover to you our confirmation of the Morocco treaty,\r\ntogether with a joint letter to Fennish. The fear that Mr. Barclay\r\nmight not be at Madrid has occasioned my giving you this trouble, as\r\nwell as that of addressing the letter properly, and of having it\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nI have received from Mr. Jay sundry despatches relative to the frigate\r\nthe South Carolina, and to a claim against the Court of Madrid founded\r\non the aid of that vessel in taking the Bahama and Providence islands,\r\nwith an instruction from Congress to confer with the Prince of\r\nLuxembourg, and get him to interest the Duke de La Vauguyon to join you\r\nin your solicitations of this matter. This is accordingly done, and you\r\nwill have the aid of the Duke. The despatches relative to this subject,\r\nI have sealed up and addressed to you, but they will be delivered to\r\nthe Duke de La Vauguyon, to find a safe occasion of forwarding them. My\r\nlast news from America was of the 15th of December. The insurgents of\r\nMassachusetts had sent in a petition to their government, praying the\r\nrelease of their leaders in jail, and an act of pardon for themselves,\r\nand offering thereon to retire every man to his home and to live\r\nsubmissively. You will have heard of the death of the Count de\r\nVergennes, and appointment of Mons. de Montmorin. I was unlucky enough\r\nfive months ago to dislocate my right wrist, and though well set, I\r\nhave as yet no use of it, except that I can write, but in pain. I am\r\nadvised to try the use of mineral waters, and those of Aix in Provence\r\nbeing as much recommended as any others, I combine with this object a\r\ndesign of making the tour of those seaports with which we trade,\r\nMarseilles, Bordeaux, Nantes, &c, and shall set out the day after\r\nto-morrow, and expect to be absent three months. This may probably\r\nprevent my having the honor of writing to you during that interval,\r\nunless anything extraordinary should arise. I take measures for the\r\nreceipt of all letters addressed to me as regularly as were I here. I\r\nhave the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARCLAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 18, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge your separate favors of December\r\n4th, and January 6th, and the joint one to Mr. Adams and myself of\r\nJanuary 6th; this last has been communicated to Congress, and to Mr.\r\nAdams. You have my full and hearty approbation of the treaty you\r\nobtained from Morocco, which is better and on better terms than I\r\nexpected. Mr. Adams and myself have annexed our confirmation to two of\r\nthe copies, one of which is gone to Congress; the other, with a joint\r\nletter to Fennish, I now enclose to Mr. Carmichael, apprehending you\r\nare not in Madrid. I concur clearly with you in opinion that, for many\r\nreasons, Mr. Carmichael would be a proper person to negotiate our\r\nbusiness with Algiers, if it be negotiable with such means as we\r\npossess. I have expressed, this opinion in my letters to America, but I\r\nam sure we cannot raise the money necessary. Colonel Franks was gone to\r\nLondon before I received your letter. He returned and embarked in the\r\npacket for Havre, but nothing was done on the subject of accounts or\r\nmoney. I was unlucky enough to dislocate my right wrist five months\r\nago, and though it was well set, I can yet make no use of it but to\r\nwrite. I am advised to try mineral waters, and those of Aix in\r\nProvence, being as much recommended as any others, I am induced to go\r\nto them by the desire of making the tour of the ports with which we\r\ntrade, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Nantes, &c. I set out in two days and\r\nshall be absent three months. The packets are finally fixed at Havre.\r\nThey sail every six weeks. Honfleur will, I think, certainly be made a\r\nfree port; and I flatter myself will become the centre for much of our\r\ntrade, and particularly that of rice. The death of Count de Vergennes,\r\nand appointment of Monsieur de Montmorin, will reach you before this\r\nletter does. I have letters, &c., from America as late as the 15th of\r\nDecember. The insurgents of Massachusetts had prayed pardon for\r\nthemselves and their leaders in jail, and on these terms had offered to\r\nretire and live peaceably at home. Mrs. Barclay and your family are\r\nwell, except they are somewhat apprehensive of a film growing over the\r\neye of your youngest daughter; but should it do so, it will be easily\r\nremoved. I have the honor to be, with much esteem and respect, dear\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 20, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of January\r\n25th. Colonel Franks sailed in the packet of this month from Havre for\r\nNew York. The arrangement of the packets opens a direct communication\r\nbetween Paris and America, and if we succeed, as I expect we will, in\r\ngetting Honfleur made a free port, I hope to see that place become the\r\ndeposit for our whale oil, rice, tobacco and furs, and that, from\r\nthence, what is not wanted in the country may be distributed to others.\r\nYou remember giving me a letter of credit on Messrs. Willinck and\r\nStaphorst for one thousand guineas to pay for the swords and medals.\r\nWhen the swords were finished, I drew on the Vandemjers, with whom the\r\nmoney was deposited, for sixty-five thousand livres, to pay for the\r\nswords. They paid it. A medal is now finished, and others will very\r\nsoon be. But these gentlemen say they must have fresh orders. In the\r\nmeantime, the workmen complain. Will you be so good as to draw in favor\r\nof Mr. Grand on Willinck, &c, for the balance of the thousand guineas\r\n(which is about the sum that will be necessary), and send the bill to\r\nMr. Grand, who, in my absence, will negotiate it and pay the workmen. I\r\nenclose you Vandemjers' answer. The meeting of the Notables on\r\nThursday, and the necessity of paying my court to our new minister,\r\nwill detain me till Friday, and perhaps till Tuesday next. Nothing is\r\nknown yet of the objects of this Assembly. I enclose you two new\r\npamphlets relative to it, and will inform you of whatever I can\r\ndiscover relative to it during my stay. I learn with real pain the\r\nresolution you have taken of quitting Europe. Your presence on this\r\nside the Atlantic gave me a confidence that, if any difficulties should\r\narise within my department, I should always have one to advise with, on\r\nwhose counsels I could rely. I shall now feel bewidowed. I do not\r\nwonder at your being tired out by the conduct of the court you are at.\r\nBut is there not room to do a great deal of good for us in Holland in\r\nthe department of money? No one can do it as well as yourself. But you\r\nhave taken your resolution on mature consideration, and I have nothing\r\nto offer, therefore, but my regrets. If anything transpires from the\r\nNotables before my departure worth communication, you shall yet hear\r\nfrom me. In the meantime, believe me to be, with sincere esteem and\r\nrespect, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 23, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The Notables met yesterday; the King opened the Assembly\r\nwith a short speech, wherein he expressed his inclination to consult\r\nwith them on the affairs of his kingdom, to receive their opinions on\r\nthe plans he had digested, and to endeavor to imitate the head of his\r\nfamily, Henry IV., whose name is so dear to the nation. The speech was\r\naffectionate. The Garde des Sceaux spoke about twenty minutes,\r\ncomplimented the clergy, the noblesse, the magistrates and tiers etats.\r\nThe Comptroller General spoke about an hour. He enumerated the expenses\r\nnecessary to arrange his department when he came into it; he said his\r\nreturns had been minutely laid before the King; he took a review of the\r\npreceding administrations, and more particularly of Mr. Neckar's; he\r\ndetailed the improvement which had been made; he portrayed the present\r\nstate of the finances, and sketched the several schemes proposed for\r\ntheir improvement; he spoke on a change in the form of the taxes, the\r\nremoval of the interior custom-houses to the frontiers, provincial\r\nadministrations and some other objects. The Assembly was then divided\r\ninto committees. To-day, there was to be another grand Assembly, the\r\nplans more fully explained and referred to the discussion of the\r\ncommittees. The grand Assembly will meet once a week and vote\r\nindividually. The propriety of my attending the first audience day of\r\nCount Montmorin, which will not be till the 27th, retards my departure\r\ntill then.\r\n\r\nI have read your book with infinite satisfaction and improvement. It\r\nwill do great good in America. Its learning and its good sense will, I\r\nhope, make it an institute for our politicians, old as well as young.\r\nThere is one opinion in it, however, which I will ask you to\r\nreconsider, because it appears to me not entirely accurate, and not\r\nlikely to do good. Page 362, \"Congress is not a legislative, but a\r\ndiplomatic assembly.\" Separating into parts the whole sovereignty of\r\nour States, some of these parts are yielded to Congress. Upon these I\r\nshould think them both legislative and executive, and that would have\r\nbeen judiciary also, had not the confederation required them for\r\ncertain purposes to appoint a judiciary. It has accordingly been the\r\ndecision of our courts that the confederation is a part of the law of\r\nthe land, and superior in authority to the ordinary laws, because it\r\ncannot be altered by the legislature of any one State. I doubt whether\r\nthey are at all a diplomatic assembly. On the first news of this work\r\nthere were proposals to translate it. Fearing it might be murdered in\r\nthat operation, I endeavored to secure a good translator. This is done,\r\nand I lend him my copy to translate from. It will be immediately\r\nannounced to keep others from attempting it. I am, with sincere esteem\r\nand respect, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 23, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Assemblee des Notables being an event in the history of this\r\ncountry which excites notice, I have supposed it would not be\r\ndisagreeable to you to learn its immediate objects, though no way\r\nconnected with our interests. The Assembly met yesterday; the King, in\r\na short but affectionate speech, informed them of his wish to consult\r\nwith them on the plans he had digested, and on the general good of his\r\npeople, and his desire to imitate the head of his family, Henry IV.,\r\nwhose memory is so dear to the nation. The Garde des Sceaux then spoke\r\nabout twenty minutes, chiefly in compliment to the orders present. The\r\nComptroller General, in a speech of about an hour, opened the budget,\r\nand enlarged on the several subjects which will be under their\r\ndeliberation. He explained the situation of the finances at his\r\naccession to office, the expenses which their arrangement had rendered\r\nnecessary, their present state, with the improvements made in them, the\r\nseveral plans which had been proposed for their future improvement, a\r\nchange in the form of some of their taxes, the removal of the interior\r\ncustom-houses to the frontiers, and the institution of Provincial\r\nAssemblies. The Assembly was then divided into committees, with a\r\nprince of the blood at the head of each. In this form, they are to\r\ndiscuss separately the subjects which will be submitted to them. Their\r\ndecision will be reported by two members to the minister, who, on view\r\nof the separate decisions of all the committees, will make such changes\r\nin his plans as will best accommodate them to their views, without too\r\nmuch departing from his own, and will then submit them to the vote (but\r\nI believe not to the debate) of the General Assembly, which will be\r\nconvened for this purpose one day in every week, and will vote\r\nindividually.\r\n\r\nThe event of the Count de Vergennes' death, of which I had the honor to\r\ninform you in a letter of the 14th instant, the appointment of the\r\nCount Montmorin, and the propriety of my attending at his first\r\naudience, which will be on the 27th, have retarded the journey I had\r\nproposed, a few days.\r\n\r\nI shall hope, on my return, to meet here new powers for the consular\r\nconvention, as under those I have, it will be impossible to make the\r\nchanges in the convention which may be wished for.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD PETERS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 26, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of October 1, covering the letter and bill to\r\nCaptain Capitaine, did not come to my hands till yesterday. I wrote to\r\nhim immediately, to inform him it should be delivered here at any\r\nmoment. We talk and think of nothing here but the Assemblee des\r\nNotables. Were all the puns collected, to which this Assembly has given\r\nrise, I think they would make a larger volume than the \"Encyclopedie.\"\r\nThe government is said to want eighty millions of livres revenue more\r\nthan they have. They propose to give to the people provincial\r\nadministrations, and to make other improvements. It is a pity they had\r\nnot more of the virtue called economy, of which we have something to\r\nspare. I hope the company of Mrs. Peters and your little ones have\r\ncured all your aches and pains both of body and mind. That you and they\r\nmay continue forever clear of them, is the sincere prayer of, dear Sir,\r\nyour friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 28, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am just now in the moment of my departure. Monsieur de\r\nMontmorin having given us audience at Paris yesterday, I missed the\r\nopportunity of seeing you once more. I am extremely pleased with his\r\nmodesty, the simplicity of his manners, and his dispositions toward us.\r\nI promise myself a great deal of satisfaction in doing business with\r\nhim. I hope he will not give ear to any unfriendly suggestions. I\r\nflatter myself I shall hear from you sometimes. Send your letters to my\r\nhotel, as usual, and they will be forwarded to me. I wish you success\r\nin your meeting. I should form better hopes of it, if it were divided\r\ninto two Houses, instead of seven. Keeping the good model of your\r\nneighboring country before your eyes, you may get on, step by step,\r\ntowards a good constitution. Though that model is not perfect, yet, as\r\nit would unite more suffrages than any new one which could be proposed,\r\nit is better to make that the object. If every advance is to be\r\npurchased by filling the royal coffers with gold, it will be gold well\r\nemployed. The King, who means so well, should be encouraged to repeat\r\nthese Assemblies. You see how we republicans are apt to preach, when we\r\nget on politics. Adieu, my dear friend. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME LA COMTESSE DE TESSE.\r\n\r\nNISMES, March 20, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere I am, Madam, gazing whole hours at the Maison Quarree, like a\r\nlover at his mistress. The stocking weavers and silk spinners around it\r\nconsider me a hypochondriac Englishman, about to write with a pistol\r\nthe last chapter of his history. This is the second time I have been in\r\nlove since I left Paris. The first was with a Diana at the Chateau de\r\nLaye-Epinaye in Beaujolois, a delicious morsel of sculpture, by M. A.\r\nSlodtz. This, you will say, was in rule, to fall in love with a female\r\nbeauty; but with a house! it is out of all precedent. No, Madam, it is\r\nnot without a precedent in my own history. While in Paris, I was\r\nviolently smitten with the Hotel de Salm, and used to go to the\r\nTuileries almost daily, to look at it. The _loueuse des chaises_,\r\ninattentive to my passion, never had the complaisance to place a chair\r\nthere, so that, sitting on the parapet, and twisting my neck round to\r\nsee the object of my admiration, I generally left it with a\r\n_torti-colli_.\r\n\r\nFrom Lyons to Nismes I have been nourished with the remains of Roman\r\ngrandeur. They have always brought you to my mind, because I know your\r\naffection for whatever is Roman and noble. At Vienna I thought of you.\r\nBut I am glad you were not there; for you would have seen me more angry\r\nthan, I hope, you will ever see me. The Praetorian Palace, as it is\r\ncalled, comparable, for its fine proportions, to the Maison Quarree,\r\ndefaced by the barbarians who have converted it to its present purpose,\r\nits beautiful fluted Corinthian columns cut out, in part, to make space\r\nfor Gothic windows, and hewed down, in the residue, to the plane of the\r\nbuilding, was enough, you must admit, to disturb my composure. At\r\nOrange, too, I thought of you. I was sure you had seen with pleasure\r\nthe sublime triumphal arch of Marius at the entrance of the city. I\r\nwent then to the Arenae. Would you believe, Madam, that in this\r\neighteenth century, in France, under the reign of Louis XVI., they are\r\nat this moment pulling down the circular wall of this superb remain, to\r\npave a road? And that, too, from a hill which is itself an entire mass\r\nof stone, just as fit, and more accessible? A former intendant, a M. de\r\nBasville, has rendered his memory dear to the traveller and amateur, by\r\nthe pains he took to preserve and restore these monuments of antiquity.\r\nThe present one (I do not know who he is) is demolishing the object, to\r\nmake a good road to it. I thought of you again, and I was then in great\r\ngood humor, at the Pont du Gard, a sublime antiquity, and well\r\npreserved. But most of all here, where Roman taste, genius, and\r\nmagnificence, excite ideas analogous to yours at every step. I could no\r\nlonger oppose the inclination to avail myself of your permission to\r\nwrite to you, a permission given with too much complaisance by you, and\r\nused by me with too much indiscretion. Madame de Tott did me the same\r\nhonor. But she, being only the descendant of some of those puny heroes\r\nwho boiled their own kettles before the walls of Troy, I shall write to\r\nher from a Grecian, rather than a Roman canton; when I shall find\r\nmyself, for example, among her Phocaean relations at Marseilles.\r\n\r\nLoving, as you do Madam, the precious remains of antiquity, loving\r\narchitecture, gardening, a warm sun and a clear sky, I wonder you have\r\nnever thought of moving Chaville to Nismes. This, as you know, has not\r\nalways been deemed impracticable; and, therefore, the next time a\r\n_Sur-intendant des batiments du roi_, after the example of M. Colbert,\r\nsends persons to Nismes to move the Maison Quarree to Paris, that they\r\nmay not come empty handed, desire them to bring Chaville with them, to\r\nreplace it. _A propos_ of Paris. I have now been three weeks from\r\nthere, without knowing anything of what has passed. I suppose I shall\r\nmeet it all at Aix, where I have directed my letters to be lodged,\r\n_poste restante_. My journey has given me leisure to reflect on this\r\nAssemblee des Notables. Under a good and a young King, as the present,\r\nI think good may be made of it. I would have the deputies then, by all\r\nmeans, so conduct themselves as to encourage him to repeat the calls of\r\nthis Assembly. Their first step should be, to get themselves divided\r\ninto two chambers instead of seven; the Noblesse and the Commons\r\nseparately. The second, to persuade the King, instead of choosing the\r\ndeputies of the Commons himself, to summon those chosen by the people\r\nfor the Provincial administrations. The third, as the Noblesse is too\r\nnumerous to be all of the Assemblee, to obtain permission for that body\r\nto choose its own deputies. Two Houses, so elected, would contain a\r\nmass of wisdom which would make the people happy, and the King great;\r\nwould place him in history where no other act can possibly place him.\r\nThey would thus put themselves in the track of the best guide they can\r\nfollow; they would soon overtake it, become its guide in turn, and lead\r\nto the wholesome modifications wanting in that model, and necessary to\r\nconstitute a rational government. Should they attempt more than the\r\nestablished habits of the people are ripe for, they may lose all, and\r\nretard indefinitely the ultimate object of their aim. These, Madam, are\r\nmy opinions; but I wish to know yours, which, I am sure, will be\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nFrom a correspondent at Nismes, you will not expect news. Were I to\r\nattempt to give you news, I should tell you stories one thousand years\r\nold. I should detail to you the intrigues of the courts of the Caesars,\r\nhow they affect us here, the oppressions of their praetors, prefects,\r\n&c. I am immersed in antiquities from morning to night. For me, the\r\ncity of Rome is actually existing in all the splendor of its empire. I\r\nam filled with alarms for the event of the irruptions daily making on\r\nus, by the Goths, the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and Vandals, lest they\r\nshould re-conquer us to our original barbarism. If I am sometimes\r\ninduced to look forward to the eighteenth century, it is only when\r\nrecalled to it by the recollection of your goodness and friendship, and\r\nby those sentiments of sincere esteem and respect with which I have the\r\nhonor to be Madam, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\nNICE, April 11, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour head, my dear friend, is full of notable things; and being better\r\nemployed, therefore, I do not expect letters from you. I am constantly\r\nroving about, to see what I have never seen before, and shall never see\r\nagain. In the great cities, I go to see what travellers think alone\r\nworthy of being seen; but I make a job of it, and generally gulp it all\r\ndown in a day. On the other hand, I am never satiated with rambling\r\nthrough the fields and farms, examining the culture and cultivators,\r\nwith a degree of curiosity which makes some take me to be a fool, and\r\nothers to be much wiser than I am. I have been pleased to find among\r\nthe people a less degree of physical misery than I had expected. They\r\nare generally well clothed, and have a plenty of food, not animal\r\nindeed, but vegetable, which is as wholesome. Perhaps they are\r\nover-worked, the excess of the rent required by the landlord obliging\r\nthem to too many hours of labor in order to produce that, and wherewith\r\nto feed and clothe themselves. The soil of Champagne and Burgundy I\r\nhave found more universally good than I had expected, and as I could\r\nnot help making a comparison with England, I found that comparison more\r\nunfavorable to the latter than is generally admitted. The soil, the\r\nclimate, and the productions are superior to those of England, and the\r\nhusbandry as good, except in one point; that of manure. In England,\r\nlong leases for twenty-one years, or three lives, to wit, that of the\r\nfarmer, his wife, and son, renewed by the son as soon as he comes to\r\nthe possession, for his own life, his wife's and eldest child's, and so\r\non, render the farms there almost hereditary, make it worth the\r\nfarmer's while to manure the lands highly, and give the landlord an\r\nopportunity of occasionally making his rent keep pace with the improved\r\nstate of the lands. Here the leases are either during pleasure, or for\r\nthree, six, or nine years, which does not give the farmer time to repay\r\nhimself for the expensive operation of well manuring, and, therefore,\r\nhe manures ill, or not at all. I suppose, that could the practice of\r\nleasing for three lives be introduced in the whole kingdom, it would,\r\nwithin the term of your life, increase agricultural productions fifty\r\nper cent.; or were any one proprietor to do it with his own lands, it\r\nwould increase his rents fifty per cent., in the course of twenty-five\r\nyears. But I am told the laws do not permit it. The laws then, in this\r\nparticular, are unwise and unjust, and ought to give that permission.\r\nIn the southern provinces, where the soil is poor, the climate hot and\r\ndry, and there are few animals, they would learn the art, found so\r\nprecious in England, of making vegetable manure, and thus improving\r\nthese provinces in the article in which nature has been least kind to\r\nthem. Indeed, these provinces afford a singular spectacle. Calculating\r\non the poverty of their soil, and their climate by its latitude only,\r\nthey should have been the poorest in France. On the contrary, they are\r\nthe richest, from one fortuitous circumstance. Spurs or ramifications\r\nof high mountains, making down from the Alps, and, as it were,\r\nreticulating these provinces, give to the valleys the protection of a\r\nparticular inclosure to each, and the benefit of a general stagnation\r\nof the northern winds produced by the whole of them, and thus\r\ncountervail the advantage of several degrees of latitude. From the\r\nfirst olive fields of Pierrelatte, to the orangeries of Hieres, has\r\nbeen continued rapture to me. I have often wished for you. I think you\r\nhave not made this journey. It is a pleasure you have to come, and an\r\nimprovement to be added to the many you have already made. It will be a\r\ngreat comfort to you, to know, from your own inspection, the condition\r\nof all the provinces of your own country, and it will be interesting to\r\nthem at some future day, to be known to you. This is, perhaps, the only\r\nmoment of your life in which you can acquire that knowledge. And to do\r\nit most effectually, you must be absolutely incognito, you must ferret\r\nthe people out of their hovels as I have done, look into their kettles,\r\neat their bread, loll on their beds under pretence of resting yourself,\r\nbut in fact, to find if they are soft. You will feel a sublime pleasure\r\nin the course of this investigation, and a sublimer one hereafter, when\r\nyou shall be able to apply your knowledge to the softening of their\r\nbeds, or the throwing a morsel of meat into their kettle of vegetables.\r\n\r\nYou will not wonder at the subjects of my letters; they are the only\r\nones which have been presented to my mind for some time past; and the\r\nwaters must always be what are the fountains from which they flow.\r\nAccording to this, indeed, I should have intermixed, from beginning to\r\nend, warm expressions of friendship to you. But according to the ideas\r\nof our country, we do not permit ourselves to speak even truths, when\r\nthey may have the air of flattery. I content myself, therefore, with\r\nsaying once for all, that I love you, your wife and children. Tell them\r\nso, and adieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\nNICE, April 12, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--At Marseilles, they told me I should encounter the rice\r\nfields of Piedmont soon after crossing the Alps. Here they tell me\r\nthere are none nearer than Vercelli and Novarra, which is carrying me\r\nalmost to Milan. I fear that this circumstance will occasion me a\r\ngreater delay than I had calculated on. However I am embarked in the\r\nproject, and shall go through with it. To-morrow, I set out on my\r\npassage over the Alps, being to pursue it ninety-three miles to Coni,\r\non mules, as the snows are not yet enough melted to admit carriages to\r\npass. I leave mine here, therefore, proposing to return by water from\r\nGenoa. I think it will be three weeks before I get back to Nice. I find\r\nthis climate quite as delightful as it has been represented. Hieres is\r\nthe only place in France, which may be compared with it. The climates\r\nare equal. In favor of this place, are the circumstances of gay and\r\ndissipated society, a handsome city, good accommodations, and some\r\ncommerce. In favor of Hieres, are environs of delicious and extensive\r\nplains, a society more contracted, and therefore more capable of\r\nesteem, and the neighborhood of Toulon, Marseilles and other places, to\r\nwhich excursions may be made. Placing Marseilles in comparison with\r\nHieres, it has extensive society, a good theatre, freedom from military\r\ncontrol, and the most animated commerce. But its winter climate is far\r\ninferior. I am now in the act of putting my baggage into portable form\r\nfor my bat-mule; after praying you therefore, to let my daughter know I\r\nam well, and that I shall not be heard of again in three weeks, I take\r\nmy leave of you for that time, with assurances of the sincere esteem\r\nwith which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nMARSEILLES, May 4, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of receiving at Aix your letter of February the\r\n9th, and immediately wrote to the Count de Montmorin, explaining the\r\ndelay of the answer of Congress to the King's letter, and desired Mr.\r\nShort to deliver that answer with my letter to Monsieur de Montmorin,\r\nwhich he informs me he has accordingly done.\r\n\r\nMy absence prevented my noting to you, in the first moment, the\r\nrevolution which has taken place at Paris, in the department of\r\nfinance, by the substitution of Monsieur de Fourqueux in the place of\r\nMonsieur de Calonne, so that you will have heard of it through other\r\nchannels before this will have the honor of reaching you.\r\n\r\nHaving staid at Aix long enough to prove the inefficacy of the waters,\r\nI came on to this place for the purpose of informing myself here, as I\r\nmean to do at the other sea-port towns, of whatever may be interesting\r\nto our commerce. So far as carried on in our own bottoms, I find it\r\nalmost nothing, and so it must probably remain till something can be\r\ndone with the Algerines. Though severely afflicted with the plague,\r\nthey have come out within these few days, and showed themselves in\r\nforce along the coast of Genoa, cannonading a little town and taking\r\nseveral vessels.\r\n\r\nAmong other objects of inquiry, this was the place to learn something\r\nmore certain on the subject of rice, as it is a great emporium for that\r\nof the Levant and of Italy. I wished particularly to know whether it\r\nwas the use of a different machine for cleaning, which brought European\r\nrice to market less broken than ours, as had been represented to me by\r\nthose who deal in that article in Paris. I found several persons who\r\nhad passed through the rice country of Italy, but not one who could\r\nexplain to me the nature of the machine. But I was given to believe\r\nthat I might see it myself immediately on entering Piedmont. As this\r\nwould require but about three weeks, I determined to go and ascertain\r\nthis point, as the chance only of placing our rice above all rivalship\r\nin quality, as it is in color, by the introduction of a better machine,\r\nif a better existed, seemed to justify the application of that much\r\ntime to it. I found the rice country to be in truth Lombardy, one\r\nhundred miles further than had been represented, and that though called\r\nPiedmont rice, not a grain is made in the country of Piedmont. I passed\r\nthrough the rice fields of the Venellese and Milanese, about sixty\r\nmiles, and returned from thence last night, having found that the\r\nmachine is absolutely the same as ours, and of course, that we need not\r\nlisten more to that suggestion. It is a difference in the species of\r\ngrain, of which the government of Turin is so sensible, that, as I was\r\ninformed, they prohibit the exportation of rough rice on pain of death.\r\nI have taken measures, however, which I think will not fail for\r\nobtaining a quantity of it, and I bought on the spot a small parcel,\r\nwhich I have with me. As further details on this subject to Congress\r\nwould be misplaced, I propose, on my return to Paris, to communicate\r\nthem, and send the rice to the society at Charleston for promoting\r\nagriculture, supposing that they will be best able to try the\r\nexperiment of cultivating the rice of this quality, and to communicate\r\nthe species to the two States of South Carolina and Georgia, if they\r\nfind it answer. I thought the staple 'of these two States was entitled\r\nto this attention, and that it must be desirable to them to be able to\r\nfurnish rice of the two qualities demanded in Europe, especially, as\r\nthe greater consumption is in the forms for which the Lombardy quality\r\nis preferred. The mass of our countrymen being interested in\r\nagriculture, I hope I do not err in supposing that in a time of\r\nprofound peace, as the present, to enable them to adapt their\r\nproductions to the market, to point out markets for them, and endeavor\r\nto obtain favorable terms of reception, is within the line of my duty.\r\n\r\nMy journey into this part of the country has procured me information\r\nwhich I will take the liberty of communicating to Congress. In October\r\nlast I received a letter dated Montpelier, October the 2d, 1786,\r\nannouncing to me that the writer was a foreigner, who had a matter of\r\nvery great consequence to communicate to me, and desired I would\r\nindicate the channel through which it might pass safely. I did so.\r\n\r\nI received soon after a letter in the following words, omitting only\r\nthe formal parts. [_A translation of it is here given._]\r\n\r\n\"I am a native of Brazil. You are not ignorant of the frightful slavery\r\nunder which my country groans. This continually becomes more\r\ninsupportable since the epoch of your glorious independence, for the\r\ncruel Portuguese omit nothing which can render our condition more\r\nwretched, from an apprehension that we may follow your example. The\r\nconviction, that these usurpers against the laws of nature and humanity\r\nonly meditate new oppressions, has decided us to follow the guiding\r\nlight which you have held out to us, to break our chains, to revive our\r\nalmost expiring liberty, which is nearly overwhelmed by that force,\r\nwhich is the sole foundation of the authority that Europeans exercise\r\nover American. But it is necessary that some power should extend\r\nassistance to the Brazilians, since Spain would certainly unite herself\r\nwith Portugal; and in spite of our advantages for defence, we could not\r\nmake it effectual, or, at least, it would be imprudent to hazard the\r\nattempt without some assurance of success. In this state of affairs,\r\nSir, we can with propriety look only to the United States, not only\r\nbecause we are following her example, but, moreover, because nature, in\r\nmaking us inhabitants of the same continent, has in some sort united us\r\nin the bonds of a common patriotism. On our part, we are prepared to\r\nfurnish the necessary supplies of money, and at all times to\r\nacknowledge the debt of gratitude due to our benefactors. I have thus,\r\nSir, laid before you a summary of my views. It is in discharge of this\r\ncommission that I have come to France, since I could not effect it in\r\nAmerica without exciting suspicion. It now remains for you to decide\r\nwhether those views can be accomplished. Should you desire to consult\r\nyour nation on them, it is in my power to give you all the information\r\nyou may require.\"\r\n\r\nAs, by this time, I had been advised to try the waters of Aix, I wrote\r\nto the gentleman my design, and that I would go off my road as far as\r\nNismes, under the pretext of seeing the antiquities of that place, if\r\nhe would meet me there. He met me, and the following is the sum of the\r\ninformation I received from him: \"Brazil contains as many inhabitants\r\nas Portugal. They are, 1. Portuguese. 2. Native whites. 3. Black and\r\nmulatto slaves. 4. Indians, civilized and savage. 1. The Portuguese are\r\nfew in number, mostly married there, have lost sight of their native\r\ncountry, as well as the prospect of returning to it, and are disposed\r\nto become independent. 2. The native whites form the body of their\r\nnation. 3. The slaves are as numerous as the free. 4. The civilized\r\nIndians have no energy, and the savage would not meddle. There are\r\ntwenty thousand regular troops. Originally these were Portuguese. But\r\nas they died off, they were replaced by natives, so that these compose\r\nat present the mass of the troops, and may be counted on by their\r\nnative country. The officers are partly Portuguese, partly Brazilians;\r\ntheir bravery is not doubted, and they understand the parade, but not\r\nthe science of their profession. They have no bias for Portugal, but no\r\nenergy either for anything. The priests are partly Portuguese, partly\r\nBrazilians, and will not interest themselves much. The Noblesse are\r\nscarcely known as such. They will, in no manner, be distinguished from\r\nthe people. The men of letters are those most desirous of a revolution.\r\nThe people are not much under the influence of their priests, most of\r\nthem read and write, possess arms, and are in the habit of using them\r\nfor hunting. The slaves will take the side of their masters. In short,\r\nas to the question of revolution, there is but one mind in that\r\ncountry. But there appears no person capable of conducting a\r\nrevolution, or willing to venture himself at its head, without the aid\r\nof some powerful nation, as the people of their own might fail them.\r\nThere is no printing press in Brazil. They consider the North American\r\nrevolution as a precedent for theirs. They look to the United States as\r\nmost likely to give them honest support, and, from a variety of\r\nconsiderations, have the strongest prejudices in our favor. This\r\ninformant is a native and inhabitant of Rio Janeiro, the present\r\nmetropolis, which contains fifty thousand inhabitants, knows well St.\r\nSalvador, the former one, and the mines d'or, which are in the centre\r\nof the country. These are all for a revolution; and, constituting the\r\nbody of the nation, the other parts will follow them. The King's fifth\r\nof the mines yields annually thirteen millions of crusadoes or half\r\ndollars. He has the sole right of searching for diamonds and other\r\nprecious stones, which yield him about half as much. His income from\r\nthose two resources alone, then, is about ten millions of dollars\r\nannually; but the remaining part of the produce of the mines, being\r\ntwenty-six millions, might be counted on for effecting a revolution.\r\nBesides the arms in the hands of the people, there are public\r\nmagazines. They have abundance of horses, but only a part of their\r\ncountry would admit the service of horses. They would want cannon,\r\nammunition, ships, sailors, soldiers and officers, for which they are\r\ndisposed to look to the United States, it being always understood that\r\nevery service and furniture will be well paid. Corn costs about twenty\r\nlivres the one hundred pounds. They have flesh in the greatest\r\nabundance, insomuch, that in some parts they kill beeves for the skin\r\nonly. The whale fishery is carried on by Brazilians altogether, and not\r\nby Portuguese; but in very small vessels, so that the fishermen know\r\nnothing of managing a large ship. They would want of us, at all times,\r\nshipping, corn and salt fish. The latter is a great article, and they\r\nare at present supplied with it from Portugal. Portugal, being without\r\neither army or navy, could not attempt an invasion under a twelvemonth.\r\nConsidering of what it would be composed, it would not be much to be\r\nfeared, and, if it failed, they would probably never attempt a second.\r\nIndeed, this source of their wealth being intercepted, they are\r\nscarcely capable of a first effort. The thinking part of the nation are\r\nso sensible of this, that they consider an early separation inevitable.\r\nThere is an implacable hatred between the Brazilians and Portuguese; to\r\nreconcile which, a former minister adopted the policy of letting the\r\nBrazilians into a participation of public offices, but subsequent\r\nadministrations have reverted to the ancient policy of keeping the\r\nadministration in the hands of native Portuguese. There is a mixture of\r\nnatives of the old appointments still remaining in office. If Spain\r\nshould invade them on their southern extremities, these are so distant\r\nfrom the body of their settlements, that they could not penetrate\r\nthence; and Spanish enterprise is not formidable. The mines d'or are\r\namong mountains inaccessible to any army, and Rio Janeiro is considered\r\nthe strongest port in the world after Gibraltar. In case of a\r\nsuccessful revolution, a republican government in a single body would\r\nprobably be established.\"\r\n\r\nI took care to impress on him, through the whole of our conversation,\r\nthat I had neither instructions nor authority to say a word to anybody\r\non this subject, and that I could only give him my own ideas, as a\r\nsingle individual; which were, that we were not in a condition at\r\npresent to meddle nationally in any war; that we wished particularly to\r\ncultivate the friendship of Portugal, with whom we have an advantageous\r\ncommerce. That yet a successful revolution in Brazil could not be\r\nuninteresting to us. That prospects of lucre might possibly draw\r\nnumbers of individuals to their aid, and purer motives our officers,\r\namong whom are many excellent. That our citizens, being free to leave\r\ntheir own country individually, without the consent of their\r\ngovernments, are equally free to go to any other.\r\n\r\nA little before I received the first letter of the Brazilian, a\r\ngentleman informed me there was a Mexican in Paris, who wished to have\r\nsome conversation with me. He accordingly called on me. The substance\r\nof the information I drew from him was as follows. He is himself a\r\nnative of Mexico, where his relations are, principally. He left it at\r\nabout seventeen years of age, and seems now to be about thirty-three or\r\nthirty-four. He classes and characterizes the inhabitants of that\r\ncountry, as follows: 1. The natives of Old Spain, possessed of most of\r\nthe offices of government, and firmly attached to it. 2. The clergy,\r\nequally attached to the government. 3. The natives of Mexico, generally\r\ndisposed to revolt, but without instruction, without energy, and much\r\nunder the dominion of their priests. 4. The slaves, mulatto and black;\r\nthe former enterprising and intelligent, the latter brave, and of very\r\nimportant weight, into whatever scale they throw themselves; but he\r\nthinks they will side with their masters. 5. The conquered Indians,\r\ncowardly, not likely to take any side, nor important which they take.\r\n6. The free Indians, brave and formidable, should they interfere, but\r\nnot likely to do so, as being at a great distance. I asked him the\r\nnumbers of these several classes, but he could not give them. The\r\nfirst, he thought very inconsiderable; that the second formed the body\r\nof the freemen; the third equal to the two first the fourth, to all the\r\npreceding; and, as to the fifth, he could form no idea of their\r\nproportion. Indeed, it appeared to me, that his conjectures as to the\r\nothers, were on loose grounds. He said he knew from good information,\r\nthere were three hundred thousand inhabitants in the city of Mexico. I\r\nwas still more cautious with him than with the Brazilian, mentioning it\r\nas my private opinion (unauthorized to say a word on the subject\r\notherwise) that a successful revolution was still at a distance with\r\nthem; that I feared they must begin by enlightening and emancipating\r\nthe minds of their people; that, as to us, if Spain should give us\r\nadvantageous terms of commerce, and remove other difficulties, it was\r\nnot probable that we should relinquish certain and present advantages,\r\nthough smaller, for uncertain and future ones, however great. I was led\r\ninto this caution by observing that this gentleman was intimate at the\r\nSpanish ambassador's, and that he was then at Paris, employed by Spain\r\nto settle her boundaries with France, on the Pyrenees. He had much the\r\nair of candor, but that can be borrowed; so that I was not able to\r\ndecide about him in my own mind.\r\n\r\nLed by a unity of subject, and a desire to give Congress as general a\r\nview of the disposition of our southern countrymen, as my information\r\nenables me, I will add an article which, old and insulated, I did not\r\nthink important enough to mention at the time I received it. You will\r\nremember, Sir, that during the late war, the British papers often gave\r\ndetails of a rebellion in Peru. The character of those papers\r\ndiscredited the information. But the truth was, that the insurrections\r\nwere so general, that the event was long on the poise. Had Commodore\r\nJohnson, then expected on that coast, touched and landed there two\r\nthousand men, the dominion of Spain in that country would have been at\r\nan end. They only wanted a point of union, which this body would have\r\nconstituted. Not having this, they acted without concert, and were at\r\nlength subdued separately. This conflagration was quenched in blood;\r\ntwo hundred thousand souls, on both sides, having perished; but the\r\nremaining matter is very capable of combustion. I have this information\r\nfrom a person who was on the spot at the time, and whose good faith,\r\nunderstanding, and means of information, leave no doubt of the facts.\r\nHe observed, however, that the numbers above supposed to have perished,\r\nwere on such conjectures only as he could collect.\r\n\r\nI trouble Congress with these details, because, however distant we may\r\nbe, both in condition and dispositions, from taking an active part in\r\nany commotions in that country, nature has placed it too near us, to\r\nmake its movements altogether indifferent to our interests, or to our\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nI hear of another _Arret_ of this court, increasing the duties on\r\nforeign stock-fish, and the premium on their own, imported into their\r\nislands; but not having yet seen it, I can say nothing certain on it. I\r\nhope the effect of this policy will be defeated by the practice which,\r\nI am told, takes place on the Banks of Newfoundland, of putting our\r\nfish into the French fishing-boats, and the parties sharing the\r\npremium, instead of ours paying the duty.\r\n\r\nI am in hopes Mr. Short will be able to send you the medals of General\r\nGates, by this packet. I await a general instruction as to these\r\nmedals. The academies of Europe will be much pleased to receive each a\r\nset.\r\n\r\nI propose to set out the day after to-morrow for Bordeaux, (by the\r\ncanal of Languedoc,) Nantes, L'Orient and Paris.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. GUIDE.\r\n\r\nMARSEILLES, May 6, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--A desire of seeing a commerce commenced between the dominions of\r\nHis Majesty, the King of Sardinia, and the United States of America,\r\nand a direct exchange of their respective productions, without passing\r\nthrough a third nation, led me into the conversation which I had the\r\nhonor of having with you on that subject, and afterwards with Monsieur\r\nTallon, at Turin, to whom I promised that I would explain to you, in\r\nwriting, the substance of what passed between us. The articles of your\r\nproduce wanted with us, are brandies, wines, oil, fruits, and\r\nmanufactured silks: those with which we can furnish you, are indigo,\r\npotash, tobacco, flour, salt fish, furs and peltries, ships and\r\nmaterials for building them. The supply of tobacco, particularly, being\r\nin the hands of government solely, appeared to me to offer an article\r\nfor beginning immediately the experiment of direct commerce. That of\r\nthe first quality can be had, at first hand, only from James river, in\r\nVirginia; those of the second and third, from the same place and from\r\nBaltimore, in Maryland. The first quality is delivered in the ports of\r\nFrance at thirty-eight livres the quintal, the second at thirty-six\r\nlivres, the third at thirty-four livres, weight and money of France, by\r\nindividuals generally. I send you the copy of a large contract, wherein\r\nthe three qualities are averaged at thirty-six livres. They may be\r\ndelivered at Nice for those prices. Indeed, it is my opinion, that by\r\nmaking shipments of your own produce to those places, and buying the\r\ntobaccos on the spot, they may be had more advantageously. In this\r\ncase, it would be expedient that merchants of Nice, Turin, and America,\r\nshould form a joint concern for conducting the business in the two\r\ncountries. Monsieur Tallon desired me to point out proper persons in\r\nAmerica, who might be addressed for this purpose. The house of the most\r\nextensive reputation, concerned in the tobacco trade, and on the\r\nfirmest funds, is that of Messrs. Ross and Pleasants, at Richmond, in\r\nVirginia. If it should be concluded, on your part, to make any attempt\r\nof this kind, and to address yourselves to these gentlemen, or any\r\nothers, it would be the best to write them your ideas, and receive\r\ntheirs, before you make either purchases or shipments. A more hasty\r\nconduct might occasion loss, and retard, instead of encouraging the\r\nestablishment of this commerce. I would undertake to write, at the same\r\ntime, to these, or any other merchants whom you should prefer, in order\r\nto dispose them favorably, and as disinterestedly as possible, for the\r\nencouragement of this essay. I must observe to you, that our vessels\r\nare fearful of coming into the Mediterranean on account of the\r\nAlgerines; and that, if you should freight vessels, those of the French\r\nwill be most advantageous for you, because received into our ports\r\nwithout paying any duties on some of those articles, and lighter than\r\nothers on all of them. English vessels, on the other hand, are\r\ndistinguished by paying heavier duties than those of any other nation.\r\nShould you desire any further information, or to pass letters with\r\ncertainty to any mercantile house in America, do me the favor to\r\naddress yourselves to me, at Paris, and I shall do whatever depends on\r\nme, for this object.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of high esteem and respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nPARIS, June 14, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Having got back to Paris three days ago, I resume\r\nimmediately the correspondence with which you have been pleased to\r\nhonor me. I wish I could have begun it with more agreeable information\r\nthan that furnished me by Mr. Grand, that the funds of the United\r\nStates here are exhausted, and himself considerably in advance; and by\r\nthe Board of Treasury at New York, that they have no immediate prospect\r\nof furnishing us supplies. We are thus left to shift for ourselves,\r\nwithout previous warning. As soon as they shall replenish Mr. Grand's\r\nhands, I will give you notice, that you may recommence your usual\r\ndrafts on him; unless the board should provide a separate fund for you,\r\ndependent on yourself alone, which I have strongly and repeatedly\r\npressed on them, in order to remove the indecency of suffering your\r\ndrafts to pass through any intermediate hand for payment.\r\n\r\nMy letters from America came down to the 24th of April. The\r\ndisturbances in the Eastern States were entirely settled. I do not\r\nlearn that the government had made any examples. Mr. Hancock's health\r\nbeing re-established, the want of which had occasioned him to resign\r\nthe government of Massachusetts, he has been re-elected to the\r\nexclusion of Governor Bowdoin. New York still refuses to pass the\r\nimpost in any form, and, were she to pass it, Pennsylvania will not\r\nuncouple it from the supplementary funds. These two States and Virginia\r\nare the only ones, my letters say, which have paid anything into the\r\nContinental treasury, for a twelve month past. I send you a copy of a\r\ncircular letter from Congress to the several States, insisting on their\r\nremoving all obstructions to the recovery of British debts. This was\r\nhurried, that it might be delivered to the Assembly of New York before\r\nthey rose. It was delivered, but they did nothing in consequence of it.\r\nThe convention to be assembled at Philadelphia will be an able one. Ten\r\nStates were known to have appointed delegates. Maryland was about to\r\nappoint; Connecticut was doubtful; and Rhode Island had refused. We are\r\nsure, however, of eleven States. South Carolina has prohibited the\r\nimportation of slaves for three years; which is a step towards a\r\nperpetual prohibition. Between six and seven hundred thousand acres of\r\nland are actually surveyed into townships, and the sales are to begin\r\nimmediately. They are not to be sold for less than a dollar the acre,\r\nin public certificates. I wrote you from Bordeaux on the subject of\r\nColonel Smith. I was sorry I missed him there, for other reasons as\r\nwell as from a curiosity to know his errand. The Notables have laid the\r\nfoundation of much good here; you have seen it detailed in the public\r\npapers. The Prince of Wales is likely to recover from his illness,\r\nwhich was very threatening. It is feared that three powers have\r\ncombined to lift the Prince of Orange out of his difficulties. Have you\r\nyet the cypher of which I formerly wrote to you, or any copy of it?\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, June 14, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I arrived at this place three days ago, and avail myself of the\r\nfirst possible moment of acknowledging the receipt of your favors of\r\nthe 5th and 7th of June. The letters they accompanied for Mr. Jay shall\r\nbe sent by the packet, which sails the 25th instant, and by a\r\npassenger. My letters from America are none later than the 24th of\r\nApril. The disturbances in the Eastern States were entirely settled. I\r\ndo not learn that the government required any capital punishments. We\r\npromise ourselves good from the Convention holding at Philadelphia. It\r\nconsists of the ablest men in America. It will surely be the instrument\r\nof referring to Congress the regulation of our trade. This may enable\r\nthem to carry into effect a general impost which one or two obstinate\r\nStates have so long prevented. Between six and seven hundred thousand\r\nacres of land are now surveyed into townships, and will be immediately\r\nsold. The backwardness of the States to bring money into the public\r\ntreasury has increased rather than diminished. This has prevented the\r\ntreasury board from remitting any money to this place for some time\r\npast, and Mr. Grand has given me notice that their funds in his hands\r\nare exhausted, and himself considerably in advance. This renders it\r\nnecessary for us to suspend all draughts on him until he shall have\r\nreceived supplies from the Board of Treasury, to whom I write to press\r\nremittances. The moment we shall have wherewithal to answer your\r\naccustomary draughts, I will exercise the pleasing office of giving you\r\nnotice of it. Indeed, I perceive by the papers that Mr. Adams is gone\r\nover to Holland. I am not without hopes that his object may be to\r\nprocure supplies of money, and that your exertions joined with his may\r\ngive relief to us all. I have no answer from Congress on the subject\r\nwhich has been thought of between us. I am afraid we may consider the\r\nrefusal of the impost as an answer. I am exceedingly anxious to see the\r\nturn the affairs of your country may take. It will surely be seen soon\r\nwhether for the better or worse. I wish nothing may be gathering in the\r\nhorizon to obscure the prospects of the patriotic party. My prayers for\r\ntheir prosperity are warm, as are the sentiments of personal esteem and\r\nrespect with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. BANNISTER, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\nPARIS, June 19, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--I have received your favor of April the 23d, from New York,\r\nand am sorry to find you have had a relapse. Time and temperance,\r\nhowever, will cure you; to which add exercise. I hope you have long ago\r\nhad a happy meeting with your friends, with whom a few hours would be\r\nto me an ineffable feast. The face of Europe appears a little turbid,\r\nbut all will subside. The Empress endeavored to bully the Turk, who\r\nlaughed at her, and she is going back. The Emperor's reformations have\r\noccasioned the appearance of insurrection in Flanders, and he,\r\naccording to character, will probably tread back his steps. A change of\r\nsystem here, with respect to the Dutch, is suspected; because the Kings\r\nof Prussia and England openly espouse the cause of the Stadtholder, and\r\nthat of the Patriots is likely to fall. The American acquaintances whom\r\nyou left here, not being stationary, you will hardly expect news of\r\nthem. Mrs. Barrett, lately dead, was, I think, known to you. I had a\r\nletter from Ledyard lately, dated at St. Petersburg. He had but two\r\nshirts, and yet more shirts than shillings. Still he was determined to\r\nobtain the palm of being the first circumambulator of the earth. He\r\nsays, that having no money, they kick him from place to place, and thus\r\nhe expects to be kicked round the globe. Are you become a great walker?\r\nYou know I preach up that kind of exercise. Shall I send you a\r\n_conte-pas_? It will cost you a dozen louis, but be a great stimulus to\r\nwalking, as it will record your steps. I finished my tour a week or ten\r\ndays ago. I went as far as Turin, Milan, Genoa; and never passed three\r\nmonths and a half more delightfully. I returned through the canal of\r\nLanguedoc, by Bordeaux, Nantes, L'Orient, and Rennes; then returned to\r\nNantes and came up the Loire to Orleans. I was alone through the whole,\r\nand think one travels more usefully when alone, because he reflects\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nPresent me in the most friendly terms to Mrs. Bannister, and to your\r\nfather, and be assured of the sincere esteem of, dear Sir, your friend\r\nand servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.[3]\r\n\r\nPARIS, June 20, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 30th of January, with a postscript\r\nof February the 5th. Having set out the last day of that month to try\r\nthe waters of Aix, and been journeying since, till the 10th instant, I\r\nhave been unable to continue my correspondence with you. In the\r\nmeantime, I have received your several favors of February the 16th,\r\nMarch the 18th and 19th, and April the 23d. The last arrived here about\r\nthe 25th of May, while those of March the 18th and 19th, though written\r\nfive weeks earlier, arrived three weeks later. I mention this to show\r\nyou how uncertain is the conveyance through England.\r\n\r\n      [3] Much of this letter is in cypher, but the notes annexed to it\r\n      have enabled the Editor to decipher and publish it.\r\n\r\nThe idea of separating the executive business of the confederacy from\r\nCongress, as the judiciary is already, in some degree, is just and\r\nnecessary. I had frequently pressed on the members individually, while\r\nin Congress, the doing this by a resolution of Congress for appointing\r\nan executive committee, to act during the sessions of Congress, as the\r\ncommittee of the States was to act during their vacations. But the\r\nreferring to this committee all executive business, as it should\r\npresent itself, would require a more persevering self-denial than I\r\nsuppose Congress to possess. It will be much better to make that\r\nseparation by a federal act. The negative, proposed to be given them on\r\nall the acts of the several legislatures, is now, for the first time,\r\nsuggested to my mind. _Prima facie_, I do not like it. It fails in an\r\nessential character; that the hole and the patch should be\r\ncommensurate. But this proposes to mend a small hole by covering the\r\nwhole garment. Not more than one out of one hundred State acts concern\r\nthe confederacy. This proposition, then, in order to give them one\r\ndegree of power, which they ought to have, gives them ninety-nine more,\r\nwhich they ought not to have, upon a presumption that they will not\r\nexercise the ninety-nine. But upon every act, there will be a\r\npreliminary question, Does this act concern the confederacy? And was\r\nthere ever a proposition so plain, as to pass Congress without a\r\ndebate? Their decisions are almost always wise; they are like pure\r\nmetal. But you know of how much dross this is the result. Would not an\r\nappeal from the State judicature to a federal court, in all cases where\r\nthe act of Confederation controlled the question, be as effectual a\r\nremedy, and exactly commensurate to the defect? A British creditor, for\r\nexample, sues for his debt in Virginia; the defendant pleads an act of\r\nthe State, excluding him from their courts; the plaintiff urges the\r\nConfederation, and the treaty made under that, as controlling the State\r\nlaw; the judges are weak enough to decide according to the views of\r\ntheir legislature. An appeal to a federal court sets all to rights. It\r\nwill be said, that this court may encroach on the jurisdiction of the\r\nState courts. It may. But there will be a power, to wit, Congress, to\r\nwatch and restrain them. But place the same authority in Congress\r\nitself, and there will be no power above them, to perform the same\r\noffice. They will restrain within due bounds, a jurisdiction exercised\r\nby others, much more rigorously than if exercised by themselves.\r\n\r\nI am uneasy at seeing that the sale of our western lands is not yet\r\ncommenced. That valuable fund for the immediate extinction of our debt\r\nwill, I fear, be suffered to slip through our fingers. Every delay\r\nexposes it to events which no human foresight can guard against. When\r\nwe consider the temper of the people of that country, derived from the\r\ncircumstances which surround them, we must suppose their separation\r\npossible, at every moment. If they can be retained till their\r\ngovernments become settled and wise, they will remain with us always,\r\nand be a precious part of our strength and our virtue. But this affair\r\nof the Mississippi, by showing that Congress is capable of hesitating\r\non a question, which proposes a clear sacrifice of the western, to the\r\nmaritime States, will with difficulty be obliterated. The proposition\r\nof my going to Madrid, to try to recover there the ground which has\r\nbeen lost at New York, by the concession of the vote of seven States, I\r\nshould think desperate. With respect to myself, weighing the pleasure\r\nof the journey and bare possibility of success, in one scale, and the\r\nstrong probability of failure and the public disappointment directed on\r\nme, in the other, the latter preponderates. Add to this, that jealousy\r\nmight be excited in the breast of a person, who could find occasions of\r\nmaking me uneasy.\r\n\r\nThe late changes in the ministry here excite considerable hopes. I\r\nthink we gain in them all. I am particularly happy at the re-entry of\r\nMalesherbes into the Council, His knowledge and integrity render his\r\nvalue inappreciable, and the greater to me, because, while he had no\r\nviews of office, we had established together the most unreserved\r\nintimacy. So far, too, I am pleased with Montmorin. His honesty\r\nproceeds from the heart as well as the head, and therefore may be more\r\nsurely counted on. The King loves business, economy, order, and\r\njustice, and wishes sincerely the good of his people; but he is\r\nirascible, rude, very limited in his understanding, and religious,\r\nbordering on bigotry. He has no mistress, loves his queen, and is too\r\nmuch governed by her. She is capricious like her brother, and governed\r\nby him; devoted to pleasure and expense; and not remarkable for any\r\nother vices or virtues. Unhappily the King shows a propensity for the\r\npleasures of the table. That for drink has increased lately, or, at\r\nleast, it has become more known.\r\n\r\nFor European news in general, I will refer you to my letter to Mr. Jay.\r\nIs it not possible, that the occurrences in Holland may excite a desire\r\nin many, of leaving that country and transferring their effects out of\r\nit, and thus make an opening for shifting into their hands, the debts\r\ndue to this country, to its officers, and Farmers? It would be surely\r\neligible. I believe Dumas, if put on the watch, might alone suffice;\r\nbut he surely might, if Mr. Adams should go when the moment offers.\r\nDumas has been in the habit of sending his letters open to me, to be\r\nforwarded to Mr. Jay. During my absence, they passed through Mr.\r\nShort's hands, who made extracts from them, by which I see he has been\r\nrecommending himself and me for the money negotiations in Holland. It\r\nmight be thought, perhaps, that I have encouraged him in this. Be\r\nassured, my dear Sir, that no such idea ever entered my head. On the\r\ncontrary, it is a business which would be the most disagreeable to me\r\nof all others, and for which I am the most unfit person living. I do\r\nnot understand bargaining, nor possess the dexterity requisite for the\r\npurpose. On the other hand, Mr. Adams, whom I expressly and sincerely\r\nrecommend, stands already on ground for that business, which I could\r\nnot gain in years. Pray set me to rights in the minds of those who may\r\nhave supposed me privy to this proposition. _En passant_, I will\r\nobserve with respect to Mr. Dumas, that the death of the Count de\r\nVergennes places Congress more at their ease, how to dispose of him.\r\nOur credit has been ill treated here in public debate, and our debt\r\nhere deemed apocryphal. We should try to transfer this debt elsewhere,\r\nand leave nothing capable of exciting ill thoughts between us. I shall\r\nmention in my letter to Mr. Jay, a disagreeable affair which Mr.\r\nBarclay has been thrown into, at Bordeaux. An honester man cannot be\r\nfound, nor a slower, nor more indecisive one. His affairs, too, are so\r\nembarrassed and desperate, that the public reputation is, every moment,\r\nin danger of being compromitted with him. He is perfectly amiable and\r\nhonest, with all his embarrassments.\r\n\r\nBy the next packet, I shall be able to send you some books, as also\r\nyour watch and pedometer. The two last are not yet done. To search for\r\nbooks, and forward them to Havre, will require more time than I had\r\nbetween my return and the departure of this packet. Having been a\r\nwitness, heretofore, to the divisions in Congress on the subject of\r\ntheir foreign ministers, it would be a weakness in me to suppose none\r\nwith respect to myself, or to count with any confidence on the renewal\r\nof my commission, which expires on the 10th day of March next; and the\r\nmore so, as instead of requiring the disapprobation of seven States, as\r\nformerly, that of one suffices for a recall, when Congress consists of\r\nonly seven States, two, when of eight, &c., which I suppose to be\r\nhabitually their numbers at present. Whenever I leave this place, it\r\nwill be necessary to begin my arrangements six months before my\r\ndeparture; and these, once fairly begun and under way, and my mind set\r\nhomewards, a change of purpose could hardly take place. If it should be\r\nthe desire of Congress that I should continue still longer, I could\r\nwish to know it, at farthest, by the packet which will sail from New\r\nYork in September. Because, were I to put off longer the quitting my\r\nhouse, selling my furniture, &c., I should not have time left to wind\r\nup my affairs; and having once quitted, and sold off my furniture, I\r\ncould not think of establishing myself here again. I take the liberty\r\nof mentioning this matter to you, not with a desire to change the\r\npurpose of Congress, but to know it in time. I have never fixed in my\r\nmind, the epoch of my return, so far as shall depend on myself, but I\r\nnever supposed it very distant. Probably I shall not risk a second vote\r\non this subject. Such trifling things may draw on me the displeasure of\r\none or two States, and thus submit me to the disgrace of a recall.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the paccan nuts, which accompanied your letter of\r\nMarch. Could you procure me a copy of the bill for proportioning crimes\r\nand punishments, in the form in which it was ultimately rejected by the\r\nHouse of Delegates? Young Mr. Bannister desired me to send him\r\nregularly the _Mercure de France_. I will ask leave to do this through\r\nyou, and that you will adopt such method of forwarding them to him, as\r\nwill save him from being submitted to postage, which they would not be\r\nworth. As a compensation for your trouble, you will be free to keep\r\nthem till you shall have read them. I am, with sentiments of the most\r\nsincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, June 21, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of addressing you in a letter of May the 4th,\r\nfrom Marseilles, which was to have gone by the last packet. But it\r\narrived a few hours too late for that conveyance, and has been\r\ncommitted to a private one, passing through England, with a promise\r\nthat it should go through no post office.\r\n\r\nI was desirous, while at the seaports, to obtain a list of the American\r\nvessels which have come to them since the peace, in order to estimate\r\ntheir comparative importance to us, as well as the general amount of\r\nour commerce with this country, so far as carried on in our own\r\nbottoms. At Marseilles, I found there had been thirty-two, since that\r\nperiod; at Cette, not a single one; at Bayonne, one of our free ports,\r\nonly one. This last fact I learned from other information, not having\r\nvisited that place; as it would have been a deviation from my route,\r\ntoo considerable for the importance of the object. At Bordeaux, Nantes,\r\nand L'Orient, I could not obtain lists in the moment; but am in hopes I\r\nshall be able to get them ere long. Though more important to us, they\r\nwill probably be more imperfect than that of Marseilles. At Nantes, I\r\nbegan with Monsieur Dobree an arrangement of his claims. I visited the\r\nmilitary stores, which have been detained there so long, opened some\r\nboxes of each kind, and found the state of their contents much better\r\nthan had been represented. An exact list of the articles is to be sent\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe importations into L'Orient of other fish oils, besides those of the\r\nwhale, brought to my notice there a defect in the letter of Monsieur de\r\nCalonne, of October the 22d, which letter was formerly communicated to\r\nyou. In that, _whale_ oil only was named. The other fish oils,\r\ntherefore, have continued to pay the old duties. In a conference with\r\nMonsieur de Villedeuil, the present Comptroller General, since my\r\nreturn, I proposed the extending the exemption to all _fish oils_,\r\naccording to the letter of the Hanseatic treaty, which had formed the\r\nbasis of the regulations respecting us. I think this will be agreed to.\r\nThe delays of office first, then the illness of Monsieur de Calonne,\r\nand lastly, his removal and the throng of business occasioned by the\r\nAssemblee des Notables, have prevented the reducing the substance of\r\nthe letter into the form of an _Arret_, as yet; though I have continued\r\nsoliciting it as much as circumstances would bear. I am now promised\r\nthat it shall be done immediately, and that it shall be so far\r\nretrospective to the date of the letter, as that all duties paid since\r\nthat, shall be refunded.\r\n\r\nThe new accessions to the ministry are valued here. Good is hoped from\r\nthe Archbishop of Toulouse, who succeeds the Count de Vergennes as\r\n_Chef du Counseil de Finance_. Monsieur de Villedeuil, the Comptroller\r\nGeneral, has been approved by the public, in the offices he has\r\nheretofore exercised. The Duke de Nivernois, called to the Council, is\r\nreckoned a good and able man; and Monsieur de Malesherbes, called also\r\nto the Council, is unquestionably the first character in the kingdom,\r\nfor integrity, patriotism, knowledge, and experience in business. There\r\nis a fear that the Marechal de Castries is disposed to retire.\r\n\r\nThe face of things in Europe is a little turbid at present; but\r\nprobably all will subside. The Empress of Russia, it is supposed, will\r\nnot push her pretensions against the Turks to actual war. Weighing the\r\nfondness of the Emperor for innovation, against his want of\r\nperseverance, it is difficult to calculate what he will do with his\r\ndiscontented subjects in Brabant and Flanders. If those provinces alone\r\nwere concerned, he would probably give back; but this would induce an\r\nopposition to his plan, in all his other dominions. Perhaps he may be\r\nable to find a compromise. The cause of the Patriots in Holland is a\r\nlittle clouded at present. England and Prussia seem disposed to\r\ninterpose effectually. The former has actually ordered a fleet of six\r\nsail of the line, northwardly, under Gore; and the latter threatens to\r\nput her troops into motion. The danger of losing such a weight in their\r\nscale, as that of Prussia, would occasion this court to prefer\r\nconciliation to war. Add to this the distress of their finances, and\r\nperhaps not so warm a zeal in the new ministry for the innovations in\r\nHolland. I hardly believe they will think it worth while to purchase\r\nthe change of constitution proposed there, at the expense of a war. But\r\nof these things you will receive more particular and more certain\r\ndetails from Mr. Dumas, to whom they belong.\r\n\r\nMr. Eden is appointed Ambassador from England to Madrid. To the hatred\r\nborne us by his court and country, is added a recollection of the\r\ncircumstances of the unsuccessful embassy to America, of which he made\r\na part. So that I think he will carry to Madrid dispositions to do us\r\nall the ill he can.\r\n\r\nThe late change in the ministry is very favorable to the prospects of\r\nthe Chevalier de La Luzerne. The Count de Montmorin, Monsieur de\r\nMalesherbes, and Monsieur de Lamoignon, the Garde des Sceaux, are his\r\nnear relations. Probably something will be done for him, and without\r\ndelay. The promise of the former administration to the Count de\r\nMoutier, to succeed to this vacancy, should it take place, will perhaps\r\nbe performed by the present one.\r\n\r\nMr. Barclay has probably informed you of his having been arrested in\r\nBordeaux, for a debt contracted in the way of his commerce. He\r\nimmediately applied to the parliament of that place, who ordered his\r\ndischarge. This took place after five days' actual imprisonment. I\r\narrived at Bordeaux a few days after his liberation. As the Procureur\r\nGeneral of the King had interested himself to obtain it, with uncommon\r\nzeal, and that too on public principles, I thought it my duty to wait\r\non him and return him my thanks. I did the same to the president of the\r\nparliament, for the body over which he presided; what would have been\r\nan insult in America, being an indispensable duty here. You will see by\r\nthe enclosed printed paper, on what grounds the Procureur insisted on\r\nMr. Barclay's liberation. Those on which the parliament ordered it, are\r\nnot expressed. On my arrival here, I spoke with the minister on that\r\nsubject. He observed that the character of consul is no protection in\r\nthis country against process for debt; that as to the character with\r\nwhich Mr. Barclay had been invested at the court of Morocco, it was\r\nquestionable whether it would be placed on the diplomatic line, as it\r\nhad not been derived immediately from Congress; that, if it were, it\r\nwould have covered him to Paris only, where he had received his\r\ncommission, had he proceeded directly thither, but that his long stay\r\nat Bordeaux must be considered as terminating it there. I observed to\r\nhim, that Mr. Barclay had been arrested almost immediately on his\r\narrival at Bordeaux. But, says he, the arrest was made void by the\r\nparliament, and still he has continued there several weeks. True, I\r\nreplied, but his adversaries declared they would arrest him again, the\r\nmoment he should go out of the jurisdiction of the parliament of\r\nBordeaux, and have actually engaged the Marechaussee on the road, to do\r\nit. This seemed to impress him. He said he could obtain a letter of\r\nsafe conduct which would protect him to Paris, but that, immediately on\r\nhis arrival here, he would be liable to arrest. I asked him if such a\r\nletter could not be obtained to protect him to Paris, and back to\r\nBordeaux, and even to America? He said, that for that, the consent of\r\nthe greater part of his creditors would be necessary; and even with\r\nthis, it was very doubtful whether it could be obtained; still if I\r\nwould furnish him with that consent, he would do what should depend on\r\nhim. I am persuaded he will, and have written to Mr. Barclay to obtain\r\nthe consent of his creditors. This is the footing on which this matter\r\nstands at present. I have stated it thus particularly, that you may\r\nknow the truth, which will probably be misrepresented in the English\r\npapers, to the prejudice of Mr. Barclay. This matter has been a great\r\naffliction to him, but no dishonor, where its true state is known.\r\nIndeed he is incapable of doing anything not strictly honorable.\r\n\r\nIn a letter of August the 30th, 1785, I had the honor of mentioning to\r\nyou what had passed here, on the subject of a convention for the\r\nregulation of the two post offices. I now enclose you a letter from the\r\nBaron D'Ogny, who is at the head of that department, which shows that\r\nhe still expects some arrangement. I have heard it said that M. de\r\nCreve-coeur is authorized to treat on this subject. You doubtless know\r\nif this be true. The articles may certainly be better adjusted there,\r\nthan here. This letter from the Baron D'Ogny was in consequence of an\r\napplication from a servant of mine, during my absence, which would not\r\nhave been made had I been here. Nor will it be repeated; it being my\r\nopinion and practice to pay small sums of money, rather than to risk\r\nfavors.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you also, copies of a letter and papers\r\nfrom the Marechal de Castries, on the claim of an individual against\r\nthe State of South Carolina, for services performed on board the\r\nIndian; and the petition of another, on a like claim; also copies of\r\nletters received from O'Bryan at Algiers, and from Mr. Lambe. A letter\r\nof the 26th of May, from Mr. Montgomery, at Alicant, informs me, that\r\nby a vessel arrived at Carthagena from Algiers, they learn the death of\r\nthe Dey of that republic. Yet, as we hear nothing of it through any\r\nother channel, it may be doubted. It escaped me at the time of my\r\ndeparture to Aix, to make arrangements for sending you the gazettes\r\nregularly, by the packets. The whole are now sent, though a great part\r\nof them are so old as to be not worth perusal. Your favor of April the\r\n24th has been duly received. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of\r\nthe most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE CORNY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, June 30, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my return to Paris, it was among my first intentions to go to the\r\nrue Chussee d'Antin, No. 17, and inquire after my friends whom I had\r\nleft there. I was told they were in England. And how do you like\r\nEngland, Madam? I know your taste for the works of art gives you a\r\nlittle disposition to Anglomania. Their mechanics certainly exceed all\r\nothers in some lines. But be just to your own nation. They have not\r\npatience, it is true, to set rubbing a piece of steel from morning till\r\nnight, as a lethargic Englishman will do, full charged with porter. But\r\ndo not their benevolence, their cheerfulness, their amiability, when\r\ncompared with the growling temper and manners of the people among whom\r\nyou are, compensate their want of patience? I am in hopes that when the\r\nsplendor of their shops, which is all that is worth looking at in\r\nLondon, shall have lost their charm of novelty, you will turn a wistful\r\neye to the people of Paris, and find that you cannot be so happy with\r\nany others. The Bois de Boulogne invites you earnestly to come and\r\nsurvey its beautiful verdure, to retire to its umbrage from the heats\r\nof the season. I was through it to-day, as I am every day. Every tree\r\ncharged me with this invitation to you. Passing by la Muette, it wished\r\nfor you as a mistress. You want a country house. This is for sale; and\r\nin the Bois de Boulogne, which I have always insisted to be most worthy\r\nof your preference. Come then, and buy it. If I had had confidence in\r\nyour speedy return, I should have embarrassed you in earnest with my\r\nlittle daughter. But an impatience to have her with me, after her\r\nseparation from her friends, added to a respect for your ease, has\r\ninduced me to send a servant for her.\r\n\r\nI tell you no news, because you have correspondents infinitely more _au\r\nfait_ of the details of Paris than I am. And I offer you no services,\r\nbecause I hope you will come as soon as the letter could, which should\r\ncommand them. Be assured, however, that nobody is more disposed to\r\nrender them, nor entertains for you a more sincere and respectful\r\nattachment, than him who, after charging you with his compliments to\r\nMonsieur de Corny, has the honor of offering you the homage of those\r\nsentiments of distinguished esteem and regard, with which he is, dear\r\nMadam, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 1, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I returned about three weeks ago from a very useless voyage;\r\nuseless, I mean, as to the object which first suggested it, that of\r\ntrying the effect of the mineral waters of Aix, in Provence, on my\r\nhand. I tried these, because recommended among six or eight others as\r\nequally beneficial, and because they would place me at the beginning of\r\na tour to the seaports of Marseilles, Bordeaux, Nantes and L'Orient,\r\nwhich I had long meditated, in hopes that a knowledge of the places and\r\npersons concerned in our commerce, and the information to be got from\r\nthem, might enable me sometimes to be useful. I had expected to satisfy\r\nmyself, at Marseilles, of the causes of the difference of quality\r\nbetween the rice of Carolina, and that of Piedmont, which is brought in\r\nquantities to Marseilles. Not being able to do it, I made an excursion\r\nof three weeks into the rice country beyond the Alps, going through it\r\nfrom Vercelli to Pavia, about sixty miles. I found the difference to\r\nbe, not in the management, as had been supposed both here and in\r\nCarolina, but in the species of rice; and I hope to enable them in\r\nCarolina, to begin the cultivation of the Piedmont rice, and carry it\r\non, hand in hand, with their own, that they may supply both qualities;\r\nwhich is absolutely necessary at this market. I had before endeavored\r\nto lead the depot of rice from Cowes to Honfleur, and hope to get it\r\nreceived there on such terms, as may draw that branch of commerce from\r\nEngland to this country. It is an object of two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand guineas a year. While passing through the towns of Turin,\r\nMilan and Genoa, I satisfied myself of the practicability of\r\nintroducing our whale oil for their consumption, and suppose it would\r\nbe equally so, in the other great cities of that country. I was sorry\r\nthat I was not authorized to set the matter on foot. The merchants with\r\nwhom I chose to ask conferences, met me freely, and communicated fully,\r\nknowing I was in a public character. I could, however, only prepare a\r\ndisposition to meet our oil merchants. On the article of tobacco, I was\r\nmore in possession of my ground; and put matters into a train for\r\ninducing their government to draw their tobaccos directly from the\r\nUnited States, and not, as heretofore, from Great Britain. I am now\r\noccupied with the new ministry here, to put the concluding hand to the\r\nnew regulations for our commerce with this country, announced in the\r\nletter of Monsieur de Calonnes, which I sent you last fall. I am in\r\nhopes, in addition to those, to obtain a suppression of the duties on\r\ntar, pitch and turpentine, and an extension of the privileges of\r\nAmerican _whale_ oil, to their _fish_ oils in general. I find that the\r\nquantity of cod-fish oil brought to L'Orient, is considerable. This\r\nbeing got off hand (which will be in a few days) the chicaneries and\r\nvexations of the Farmers on the article of tobacco, and their elusions\r\nof the order of Bernis, call for the next attention. I have reasons to\r\nhope good dispositions in the new ministry towards our commerce with\r\nthis country. Besides endeavoring, on all occasions, to multiply the\r\npoints of contact and connection with this country, which I consider as\r\nour surest mainstay under every event, I have had it much at heart to\r\nremove from between us every subject of misunderstanding or irritation.\r\nOur debts to the King, to the Officers, and the Farmers, are of this\r\ndescription. The having complied with no part of our engagements in\r\nthese, draws on us a great deal of censure, and occasioned a language\r\nin the Assemblee des Notables, very likely to produce dissatisfaction\r\nbetween us. Dumas being on the spot in Holland, I had asked of him some\r\ntime ago, in confidence, his opinion of the practicability of\r\ntransferring these debts from France to Holland, and communicated his\r\nanswer to Congress, pressing them to get you to go over to Holland, and\r\ntry to effect this business. Your knowledge of the ground, and former\r\nsuccesses, occasioned me to take this liberty without consulting you,\r\nbecause I was sure you would not weigh your personal trouble against\r\npublic good. I have had no answer from Congress; but hearing of your\r\njourney to Holland, have hoped that some money operations had led you\r\nthere. If it related to the debts of this country, I would ask a\r\ncommunication of what you think yourself at liberty to communicate, as\r\nit might change the form of my answers to the eternal applications I\r\nreceive. The debt to the officers of France carries an interest of\r\nabout two thousand guineas, so we may suppose its principal is between\r\nthirty and forty thousand. This makes more noise against us, than all\r\nour other debts put together.\r\n\r\nI send you the _Arrets_ which begin the reformation here, and some\r\nother publications respecting America; together with copies of letters\r\nreceived from O'Bryan and Lambe. It is believed that a naval armament\r\nhas been ordered at Brest, in correspondence with that of England. We\r\nknow, certainly, that orders are given to form a camp in the\r\nneighborhood of Brabant, and that Count Rochambeau has the command of\r\nit. Its amount, I cannot assert. Report says fifteen thousand men. This\r\nwill derange the plans of economy. I take the liberty of putting under\r\nyour cover, a letter for Mrs. Kinloch, of South Carolina, with a\r\npacket, and will trouble you to inquire for her, and have them\r\ndelivered. The packet is of great consequence, and therefore referred\r\nto her care, as she will know the safe opportunities of conveying it.\r\nShould you not be able to find her, and can forward the packet to its\r\naddress, by any very safe conveyance, I will beg you to do it. I have\r\nthe honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect friendship and\r\nesteem, dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DAVID HARTLEY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received lately your favor of April the 23d, on my return\r\nfrom a journey of three or four months; and am always happy in an\r\noccasion of recalling myself to your memory. The most interesting\r\nintelligence from America, is that respecting the late insurrection in\r\nMassachusetts. The cause of this has not been developed to me, to my\r\nperfect satisfaction. The most probable is, that those individuals were\r\nof the imprudent number of those, who have involved themselves in debt\r\nbeyond their abilities to pay, and that a vigorous effort in that\r\ngovernment to compel the payment of private debts, and raise money for\r\npublic ones, produced the resistance. I believe you may be assured,\r\nthat an idea or desire of returning to anything like their ancient\r\ngovernment, never entered into their heads. I am not discouraged by\r\nthis. For thus I calculate. An insurrection in one of thirteen States,\r\nin the course of eleven years that they have subsisted, amounts to one\r\nin any particular State, in one hundred and forty-three years, say a\r\ncentury and a half. This would not be near as many, as have happened in\r\nevery other government that has ever existed. So that we shall have the\r\ndifference between a light and a heavy government, as clear gain. I\r\nhave no fear, but that the result of our experiment will be, that men\r\nmay be trusted to govern themselves without a master. Could the\r\ncontrary of this be proved, I should conclude, either that there is no\r\nGod, or that he is a malevolent being. You have heard of the federal\r\nconvention, now sitting at Philadelphia, for the amendment of the\r\nConfederation. Eleven States appointed delegates certainly; it was\r\nexpected that Connecticut would also appoint, the moment its Assembly\r\nmet. Rhode Island had refused. I expect they will propose several\r\namendments; that that relative to our commerce will probably be adopted\r\nimmediately, but that the others must wait to be adopted, one after\r\nanother, in proportion as the minds of the States ripen for them. Dr.\r\nFranklin enjoys good health. I shall always be happy to hear from you,\r\nbeing with sentiments of very sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of February the 16th, came to my hands in the\r\nmoment I was setting out on a tour through the southern parts of France\r\nand northern of Italy, from which I am but just now returned. I avail\r\nmyself of the earliest moment to acknowledge its receipt, and to thank\r\nyou for the box of magnets which I found here. Though I do not know\r\ncertainly, by, or from whom they come, I presume they came by Colonel\r\nSmith, who was here in my absence, and from Messrs. Nairne and Blunt,\r\nthrough your good offices. I think your letter of February the 16th,\r\nflatters me with the expectation of another, with observations, on the\r\nhygrometers I had proposed. I value what comes from you too much, not\r\nto remind you of it. Your favor by Mr. Garnett also, came during my\r\nabsence. I presume he has left Paris, as I can hear nothing of him. I\r\nhave lost the opportunity, therefore, of seeing his method of resisting\r\nfriction, as well as of showing, by attentions to him, respect for\r\nyourself and your recommendations. Mr. Paine (Common Sense) is here on\r\nhis way to England. He has brought the model of an iron bridge, with\r\nwhich he supposes a single arch of four hundred feet, may be made. It\r\nhas not yet arrived in Paris. Among other projects, with which we begin\r\nto abound in America, is one for finding the latitude by the variation\r\nof the magnetic needle. The author supposes two points, one near each\r\npole, through the northern of which, pass all the magnetic meridians of\r\nthe northern hemisphere, and through the southern, those of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. He determines their present position and\r\nperiodical revolution. It is said, his publication is plausible. I have\r\nnot seen it.\r\n\r\nWhat are you going to do with your naval armament on your side the\r\nchannel? Perhaps you will ask me, what they are about to do here? A\r\nBritish navy and Prussian army hanging over Holland on one side, a\r\nFrench navy and army hanging over it on the other, looks as if they\r\nthought of fighting. Yet I think both parties too wise for that, too\r\nlaudably intent on economizing, rather than on further embarrassing\r\ntheir finances. May they not propose to have a force on the spot, to\r\nestablish some neutral form of a constitution, which these powers will\r\ncook up among themselves, without consulting the parties for whom it is\r\nintended? The affair of Geneva shows such combinations possible.\r\nWretched, indeed, is the nation in whose affairs foreign powers are\r\nonce permitted to intermeddle. Lord Wycombe is with us at present. His\r\ngood sense, information and discretion, are much beyond his years, and\r\npromise good things for your country.\r\n\r\nI beg you to accept assurances of the esteem and respect with which I\r\nhave the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. WILLIAM GORDON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--Being just returned from a tour through the southern parts of\r\nFrance and northern of Italy, I could not till this moment, acknowledge\r\nthe receipt of your obliging letter with the papers accompanying it. It\r\nhappened unluckily also that those addressed to the Marquis de La\r\nFayette, were under my cover. I put them into his hands the moment of\r\nmy return. From the opportunities you have had of coming at facts known\r\nas yet to no other historian, from your dispositions to relate them\r\nfairly, and from your known talents, I have sanguine expectations that\r\nyour work will be a valuable addition to historical science; and the\r\nmore so, as we have little yet on the subject of our war, which merits\r\nrespect. I fear, however, that this is not the field from which you are\r\nto expect profit. The translation will sell here; but few read English.\r\nBe assured, that nothing shall be wanting on my part to encourage a\r\npreference of the original to a translation; but it will not be till\r\nthe fall that either will be called for, because, during summer, the\r\nreaders are in the country. I got from a bookseller here about forty\r\nguineas for a first copy of Dr. Ramsay's work, which he had translated.\r\nIf this would be an object with you, I offer you my service. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with sentiments of great esteem, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. B. HOLLIS, ESQ.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--On my return from a tour through the southern parts of France and\r\nnorthern of Italy, I found here the present of books you had been so\r\nkind as to send me. I should value them highly for their intrinsic\r\nmerit, but much more as coming from you. You will have seen that one of\r\nour republics has experienced those commotions which the newspapers\r\nhave been always ascribing to all of them. I am not satisfied what has\r\nbeen the cause of this, but the most probable account is, that these\r\nindividuals were of those who have so imprudently involved themselves\r\nin debt; and that a vigorous exertion in their government to enforce\r\nthe payment of private debts, and raise money for the public ones,\r\noccasioned the insurrection. One insurrection in thirteen States in the\r\ncourse of eleven years that they have existed, amounts to one in any\r\nindividual State in one hundred and forty-three years, say a century\r\nand a half. This will not weigh against the inconveniences of a\r\ngovernment of force, such as are monarchies and aristocracies. You see\r\nI am not discouraged by this little difficulty; nor have I any doubt\r\nthat the result of our experiment will be, that men are capable of\r\ngoverning themselves without a master. I have the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of the highest esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BONDFIELD.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Revising the letters and notes in my possession on the\r\nsubject of our commerce, I observe you say in your letter of December\r\n12, that we pay alien duties in the ports of France, supposed the\r\ndouble of what we ought to pay. If by this you mean that we are not on\r\nas favorable a footing as Spain, it would be vain to remonstrate on\r\nthat subject. The family compact expressly excluded all other nations\r\nfrom the advantages the two parties ceded to each other; but if there\r\nbe any other nation which enjoys any greater advantages in the ports of\r\nFrance than we do, I should wish to know it, because, if it be not in\r\nconsequence of a particular compensation, I should hope to remove it.\r\nWill you be so good as to explain the matter? and shall I ask the\r\nfurther favor of you to forward the enclosed letter by the first vessel\r\ngoing from your port to Virginia. I wish to hear from Mr. Barclay, who,\r\nI suppose, is still with you, and whose service and comfort I have\r\nsincerely at heart. I am, with much esteem and respect, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAMES MANNY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The reason why the receipt of your favor of May 21, has been\r\nthus unacknowledged, was my absence on a tour round the sea-port towns,\r\nfrom which I am just returned. In the meantime, the occasion of your\r\ninquiry relative to Mr. Morris' bills has passed; nor could I now\r\nexplain the reason of their protest. I understand, however, that they\r\nare since honored. The effect, therefore, will only be to show that\r\nthere is a limit even to his credit.\r\n\r\nRecent appearances in Europe would seem to threaten war. On one side,\r\nEngland sending a navy of observation to hover over Holland, and\r\nPrussia an army; this country sending a navy and army to hover over the\r\nother side of the same country; yet it is morally sure that all these\r\npowers desire peace most ardently. It remains to see, then, whether\r\nthey mean any more than to arrange a kind of constitution which shall\r\nbe merely neutral, and to force it on the United Netherlands, as done\r\nin the case of Geneva. I need not write you American news. You have it\r\nof later date than I have. I shall, therefore, only add assurances of\r\nthe esteem and respect with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. L'ABBE MORELLET.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am sorry, my dear Sir, that your interest should be affected by the\r\nill behavior of Barrois; but when you consider the facts, you will be\r\nsensible that I could not have indulged his indolence further without\r\nincreasing the injury to a more punctual workman. Stockdale, of London,\r\nhad asked leave to print my Notes. I agreed to it, and promised he\r\nshould have the plate of the map as soon as it should be corrected, and\r\nthe copies struck off for you and myself. He thereupon printed his\r\nedition completely in three weeks. The printer, who was to strike off\r\ntwo hundred and fifty maps for me, kept the plate but five days. It was\r\nthen delivered to Barrois, with notice that it could not be left longer\r\nwith him than should suffice to strike off his number. Repeated\r\napplications for it by Mr. Short and my servant were only answered by\r\nrepeated promises and times of delivery fixed, no one of which was\r\nperformed. When I returned, he had been possessed of the plate upwards\r\nof two months. I was astonished and confounded to be told it had not\r\nbeen sent to Stockdale, and that his edition had been lying dead on his\r\nhands three months. I sent to Barrois the very day of my return, to let\r\nhim know, that justice to Stockdale did not permit me to defer sending\r\nhim the plate any longer, yet I would wait five days, at the end of\r\nwhich he must deliver me the plate, whether his maps were done or not.\r\nI received no answer, but waited ten days. I then sent for the plate.\r\nThe answer was, he was not at home. I sent again the next day. Answer,\r\nhe was not at home. I sent the third day. Not at home. I then ordered\r\nthe messenger to go back, and wait till he should come home. This\r\nproduced an answer of two lines, _qu'il alloit soigner son ouvrier_? I\r\nwrote him word in return to deliver the plate instantly. This I think\r\nwas on Saturday or Sunday. He told the messenger he would let me have\r\nit the Thursday following. I took patience, and sent on the Friday, but\r\ntelling the messenger if he refused to deliver it, to inform him I\r\nwould be plagued no more with sending messages, but apply to the\r\npolice. He then delivered it, and I sent it off immediately to London.\r\nHe had kept it three months, of which three weeks were after my return.\r\nI think, Sir, you will be satisfied that justice to Stockdale, justice\r\nto myself who had passed my word for sending on the plate, and\r\nsensibility to the shuffling conduct of Barrois, permitted me to act no\r\notherwise. But no matter. Let his ill behavior make no odds between you\r\nand me. It will affect your interest, and that suffices to determine me\r\nto order back the plate as soon as Stockdale has done with it. He will\r\nnot require more days than Barrois months, so that it will be here\r\nbefore you can want it. But it must never go into Barrois' hands again,\r\nnor of any person depending on him, or under his orders. The workman\r\nwho struck off the two hundred and fifty for me seems to have been\r\ndiligent enough. Either he, or any other workman you please of that\r\ndescription, shall have it to strike what number you wish. I forgot to\r\nobserve, in its proper place, that when I was in the midst of my\r\ndifficulties, I did myself the honor of calling on you, as well to have\r\nthat of asking after your health on my return as of asking your\r\nassistance to obtain the plate. Unluckily you were gone to Versailles,\r\nso I was obliged to proceed as well as I could. It is no excuse for\r\nBarrois to say he could not get his Imprimeur to proceed. He should\r\nhave applied to another. But as to you, it shall be set to rights in\r\nthe manner I have before stated. Accept my regret that you were in the\r\nhands of so undeserving a workman, and one who placed me under the\r\nnecessity of interrupting a work which interested you. Be assured, at\r\nthe same time, of the sincerity of those sentiments of esteem and\r\nrespect with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n                        ---------------------\r\n\r\n[_The following observations appear to have been addressed to the Count\r\nde Montmorin, about the 6th of July, 1787._]\r\n\r\nObservations on the letter of Monsieur de Calonnes to Monsieur\r\nJefferson, dated Fontainebleau, October 22, 1786.\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed, in the course of the last year, to take a\r\nview of the subjects of commerce which might be brought from the United\r\nStates of America, in exchange for those of France, and to consider\r\nwhat advantages and facilities might be offered to encourage that\r\ncommerce. The letter of Monsieur de Calonnes was founded on their\r\nreport. It was conclusive as to the articles on which satisfactory\r\ninformation had been then obtained, and reserved, for future\r\nconsideration, certain others, needing further inquiry. It is proposed\r\nnow to review those unfinished articles, that they may also be\r\ncomprehended in the _Arret_, and the regulations on this branch of\r\ncommerce, be rendered complete.\r\n\r\n1. The letter promised to diminish the \"Droits du Roi et d'amiraute,\"\r\npayable by an American vessel entering into a port of France, and to\r\nreduce what should remain into a single duty, which shall be regulated\r\nby the draught of the vessel, or her number of masts. It is doubted\r\nwhether it will be expedient to regulate the duty in either of these\r\nways. If by the draught of water, it will fall unequally on us as a\r\nnation; because we build our vessels sharp-bottomed, for swift sailing,\r\nso that they draw more water than those of other nations, of the same\r\nburthen. If by the number of masts, it will fall unequally on\r\nindividuals; because we often see ships of one hundred and eighty tons,\r\nand brigs of three hundred and sixty. This, then, would produce an\r\ninequality among individuals, of six to one. The present principle is\r\nthe most just, to regulate by the burthen. It is certainly desirable,\r\nthat these duties should be reduced to a single one. Their names and\r\nnumbers perplex and harass the merchant more than their amount; subject\r\nhim to imposition, and to the suspicion of it when there is none. An\r\nintention of general reformation in this article, has been accordingly\r\nannounced, with augmentation as to foreigners. We are in hopes, that\r\nthis augmentation is not to respect us; because it is proposed as a\r\nmeasure of reciprocity, whereas, in some of our States, no such duties\r\nexist, and in the others, they are extremely light; because we have\r\nbeen made to hope a diminution, instead of augmentation; and because\r\nthis distinction cannot draw on France any just claims from other\r\nnations; the _Jura gentis amicissimcae_, conferred by her late treaties,\r\nhaving reference expressly to the nations of Europe only; and those\r\nconferred by the more ancient ones, not being susceptible of any other\r\ninterpretation, nor admitting a pretension of reference to a nation\r\nwhich did not then exist, and which has come into existence under\r\ncircumstances, distinguishing its commerce from that of all other\r\nnations. Merchandise received from them, takes employment from the poor\r\nof France; ours gives it; theirs is brought in the last stage of\r\nmanufacture; ours in the first; we bring our tobaccos to be\r\nmanufactured into snuff, our flax and hemp into linen and cordage, our\r\nfurs into hats, skins into saddlery, shoes and clothing; we take\r\nnothing till it has received the last hand.\r\n\r\n2. Fish oils. The Hanseatic treaty was the basis on which the\r\ndiminution of duty on this article was asked and granted. It is\r\nexpressly referred to as such, in the letter of Monsieur de Calonnes.\r\nInstead, however, of the expression, \"huile et graisse de baleine et\r\nd'autres poissons,\" used in that treaty, the letter uses the terms,\r\n\"huiles de baleine, spermaceti, et tout ce qui est compris sous ces\r\ndenominations.\" And the Farmers have availed themselves of this\r\nvariation, to refuse the diminution of duty on the oils of the _vache\r\nmarine_, _chein de mer_, _esturgeon_, and other fish. It is proposed,\r\ntherefore, to re-establish in the _Arret_, the expression of the\r\nHanseatic treaty, and to add, from the same treaty, the articles\r\n\"baleine coupee et fanon de baleine.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter states these regulations as finally made by the King. The\r\nmerchants, on this supposition, entered into speculations. But they\r\nfound themselves called on for the old duties, not only on other fish\r\noils, but on the whale oil. Monsieur de Calonnes always promised that\r\nthe _Arret_ should be retrospective to the date of the letter, so as to\r\nrefund to them the duties they had thus been obliged to pay. To this,\r\nattention is prayed in forming the _Arret_. His Majesty having been\r\npleased, as an encouragement to the importation of our fish oils, to\r\nabolish the _Droits de fabrication_, it is presumed that the purpose\r\nannounced, of continuing those duties on foreign oils, will not be\r\nextended to us.\r\n\r\n3. Rice. The duty on this is only seven and a half deniers the quintal,\r\nor about one-quarter per cent. on its first cost. While this serves to\r\ninform a government of the quantities imported, it cannot discourage\r\nthat importation. Nothing further, therefore, is necessary on this\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n4. Pot-asse. This article is of principal utility to France, in her\r\nbleacheries of linen, glass works, and soap works; and the potash of\r\nAmerica, being made of green wood, is known to be the best in the\r\nworld. All duty on it was therefore abolished by the King. But the city\r\nof Rouen levies on it a duty of twenty sols the quintal, which is very\r\nsensible in its price, brings it dearer to the bleacheries near Paris,\r\nto those of Beauvais, Laval, etc., and to the glass works, and\r\nencourages them to give a preference to the potash or soude of other\r\nnations. This is a counteraction of the views of the King, expressed in\r\nthe letter, which it is hoped will be prevented.\r\n\r\n5. Turpentine, tar and pitch, were not decided on, on the former\r\noccasion. Turpentine (_terebenthine_) pays ten sols the quintal, and\r\nten sols the livre, making fifteen sols the quintal; which is ten per\r\ncent. on its prime cost. Tar (_goudron brai gras_) pays eight livres\r\nthe _leth_ of twelve barrels, and ten sols the livre, amounting to\r\ntwenty sols the barrel; which is twelve and a half per cent. on its\r\nprime cost. Pitch (_brai sec_) pays ten sols the quintal, and ten sols\r\nthe livre, making fifteen sols the quintal; which is twenty per cent.\r\non its prime cost. Duties of from ten to twenty per cent. on articles\r\nof heavy carriage, prevent their importation. They eat up all the\r\nprofits of the merchant, and often subject him to loss. This has been\r\nmuch the case with respect to turpentine, tar and pitch, which are\r\nprincipal articles of remittance for the State of North Carolina. It is\r\nhoped, that it will coincide with the views of government, in making\r\nthe present regulations, to suppress the duties on these articles,\r\nwhich, of all others, can bear them best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. M. RANDOLPH, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 6, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of April the 14th, came here during my absence on\r\na journey through the southern parts of France and northern of Italy,\r\nfrom which I am but lately returned. This cause alone has prevented\r\nyour receiving a more early answer to it. I am glad to find, that among\r\nthe various branches of science presenting themselves to your mind, you\r\nhave fixed on that of politics as your principal pursuit. Your country\r\nwill derive from this a more immediate and sensible benefit. She has\r\nmuch for you to do. For, though we may say with confidence, that the\r\nworst of the American constitutions is better than the best which ever\r\nexisted before, in any other country, and that they are wonderfully\r\nperfect for a first essay, yet every human essay must have defects. It\r\nwill remain, therefore, to those now coming on the stage of public\r\naffairs, to perfect what has been so well begun by those going off it.\r\nMathematics, Natural Philosophy, Natural History, Anatomy, Chemistry,\r\nBotany, will become amusements for your hours of relaxation, and\r\nauxiliaries to your principal studies. Precious and delightful ones\r\nthey will be. As soon as such a foundation is laid in them, as you may\r\nbuild on as you please, hereafter, I suppose you will proceed to your\r\nmain objects, Politics, Law, Rhetoric, and History. As to these, the\r\nplace where you study them is absolutely indifferent. I should except\r\nRhetoric, a very essential member of them, and which I suppose must be\r\ntaught to advantage where you are. You would do well, therefore, to\r\nattend the public exercises in this branch also, and to do it with very\r\nparticular diligence. This being done, the question arises, where you\r\nshall fix yourself for studying Politics, Law, and History? I should\r\nnot hesitate to decide in favor of France, because you will, at the\r\nsame time, be learning to speak the language of that country, become\r\nabsolutely essential under our present circumstances. The best method\r\nof doing this, would be to fix yourself in some family where there are\r\nwomen and children, in Passy, Auteuil, or some other of the little\r\ntowns in reach of Paris. The principal hours of the day, you will\r\nattend to your studies, and in those of relaxation, associate with the\r\nfamily. You will learn to speak better from women and children in three\r\nmonths, than from men in a year. Such a situation, too, will render\r\nmore easy a due attention to economy of time and money. Having pursued\r\nyour main studies here, about two years, and acquired a facility in\r\nspeaking French, take a tour of four or five months through this\r\ncountry and Italy, return then to Virginia, and pass a year in\r\nWilliamsburg, under the care of Mr. Wythe; and you will be ready to\r\nenter on the public stage, with superior advantages. I have proposed to\r\nyou, to carry on the study of the law with that of politics and\r\nhistory. Every political measure will, forever, have an intimate\r\nconnection with the laws of the land; and he, who knows nothing of\r\nthese, will always be perplexed, and often foiled by adversaries having\r\nthe advantage of that knowledge over him. Besides, it is a source of\r\ninfinite comfort to reflect, that under every chance of fortune, we\r\nhave a resource in ourselves from which we may be able to derive an\r\nhonorable subsistence. I would, therefore, propose not only the study,\r\nbut the practice of the law for some time, to possess yourself of the\r\nhabit of public speaking. With respect to modern languages, French, as\r\nI have before observed, is indispensable. Next to this, the Spanish is\r\nmost important to an American. Our connection with Spain is already\r\nimportant, and will become daily more so. Besides this, the ancient\r\npart of American history is written chiefly in Spanish. To a person who\r\nwould make a point of reading and speaking French and Spanish, I should\r\ndoubt the utility of learning Italian. These three languages, being all\r\ndegeneracies from the Latin, resemble one another so much, that I doubt\r\nthe probability of keeping in the head a distinct knowledge of them\r\nall. I suppose that he who learns them all, will speak a compound of\r\nthe three, and neither perfectly. The journey which I propose to you\r\nneed not be expensive, and would be very useful. With your talents and\r\nindustry, with science, and that steadfast honesty which eternally\r\npursues right, regardless of consequences, you may promise yourself\r\neverything--but health, without which there is no happiness. An\r\nattention to health, then, should take place of every other object. The\r\ntime necessary to secure this by active exercises, should be devoted to\r\nit, in preference to every other pursuit. I know the difficulty with\r\nwhich a studious man tears himself from his studies, at any given\r\nmoment of the day. But his happiness, and that of his family, depend on\r\nit. The most uninformed mind, with a healthy body, is happier than the\r\nwisest valetudinarian. I need not tell you, that if I can be useful to\r\nyou in any part of this, or any other plan you shall adopt, you will\r\nmake me happy by commanding my services.\r\n\r\nWill you be so good, Sir, as to return my most respectful thanks for\r\nthe diploma with which I am honored by the society instituted with you,\r\nfor the encouragement of the study of Natural History? I am afraid it\r\nwill never be in my power to contribute anything to the object of the\r\ninstitution. Circumstances have thrown me into a very different line of\r\nlife, and not choice, as I am happy to find in your case. In the year\r\n1781, while confined to my room by a fall from my horse, I wrote some\r\nNotes, in answer to the inquiries of M. de Marbois, as to the natural\r\nand political state of Virginia. They were hasty and undigested; yet as\r\nsome of these touch slightly on some objects of its natural history, I\r\nwill take the liberty of asking the society to accept a copy of them.\r\nFor the same reason, and because, too, they touch on the political\r\ncondition of our country, I will beg leave to present you with a copy,\r\nand ask the favor of you to find a conveyance for them from London to\r\nEdinburgh. They are printed by Stockdale, bookseller, Piccadilly, and\r\nwill be ready in three or four weeks from this time. I will direct him\r\nto deliver two copies to your order.\r\n\r\nRepeating, constantly, the proffer of my services, I shall only add\r\nassurances of the esteem and attachment with which I am, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD RUTLEDGE, ESQ.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 14, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your favor of the 14th of October in the moment I\r\nwas setting out on a tour of the sea port towns of this country, from\r\nwhich I have been not long returned. I received it, too, with that kind\r\nof heartfelt pleasure which always attends the recollection of ancient\r\naffections. I was glad to find that the adaptation of your rice to this\r\nmarket was considered worth attention, as I had supposed it. I set out\r\nfrom hence impressed with the idea the rice-dealers here had given me,\r\nthat the difference between your rice and that of Piedmont proceeded\r\nfrom a difference in the machine for cleaning it. At Marseilles I hoped\r\nto know what the Piedmont machine was; but I could find nobody who knew\r\nanything of it. I determined, therefore, to sift the matter to the\r\nbottom, by crossing the Alps into the rice country. I found their\r\nmachine exactly such a one as you had described to me in Congress in\r\nthe year 1783. There was but one conclusion then to be drawn, to wit,\r\nthat the rice was of a different species, and I determined to take\r\nenough to put you in seed; they informed me, however, that its\r\nexportation in the husk was prohibited, so I could only bring off as\r\nmuch as my coat and surtout pockets would hold. I took measures with a\r\nmuleteer to run a couple of sacks across the Apennines to Genoa, but\r\nhave not great dependence on its success. The little, therefore, which\r\nI brought myself, must be relied on for fear we should get no more; and\r\nbecause, also, it is genuine from Vercilli, where the best is made of\r\nall the Sardinian Lombardy, the whole of which is considered as\r\nproducing a better rice than the Milanese. This is assigned as the\r\nreason for the strict prohibition. Piedmont rice sold at Nice, (the\r\nport of its exportation,) when I was there, at seventeen livres French,\r\nthe French hundred weight. It varies from time to time as the price of\r\nwheat does with us. The price of Carolina rice at Bordeaux, Nantes,\r\nL'Orient and Havre, varies from sixteen florins to twenty-four florins\r\nthe French quintal, which is equal to one hundred and nine pounds our\r\nweight. The best ports to send it to are Bordeaux and Havre, (or Rouen,\r\nwhich is the same thing as Havre,) but it is essential that it arrive\r\nhere a month before the commencement of Lent, when the principal demand\r\nis made for it. Carolina rice, after being sorted here into several\r\nqualities, sells from six sols to ten sols the French pound, retail,\r\naccording to the quality. Unsorted and wholesale about thirty florins\r\nthe French quintal. Piedmont rice is of but one quality, which sells at\r\nretail at ten sous the French pound, and wholesale is about three or\r\nfour livres dearer than yours. In order to induce your countrymen to\r\nship their rice here directly, I have proposed to some merchants here\r\nto receive consignments, allowing the consigner to draw in the moment\r\nof shipping for as much as he could sell on the spot, and the balance\r\nwhen it should be sold. But they say this is impossible. They are to\r\nconsider and inform me what are the most favorable terms on which they\r\ncan receive it. I am told that freight, insurance, and commission are\r\nabout four livres the French quintal to a sea-port town. I have written\r\nso long a letter on the subject of rice to Mr. Drayton for the Society\r\nof Agriculture, that I will trouble you with no further particulars,\r\nbut refer you to that. Indeed, I am sensible I have written too much on\r\nthe subject. Being absolutely ignorant of it myself, it was impossible\r\nfor me to know what particulars merited communication. I thought it\r\nbest, therefore, to communicate everything. After writing that letter,\r\nI received one from Mr. Izard, by which I found that he had examined\r\nthe rice-process in Lombardy. He was so much more capable than myself\r\nof giving the details, that I had at one moment determined to suppress\r\nmy letter. However, observing that he considered the rice at Piedmont\r\nto be of the same species with yours, and suspecting myself certainly\r\nthat it is not, I determined to hazard my letter and all those\r\ncriticisms which fall justly on an ignorant person writing on a subject\r\nto those much more learned in it than himself. A part of my letter,\r\ntoo, related to the olive tree and caper, the first of which would\r\nsurely succeed in your country, and would be an infinite blessing after\r\nsome fifteen or twenty years. The caper would also probably succeed,\r\nand would offer a very great and immediate profit. I thank you for your\r\nobliging mention of my worthless Notes on Virginia. Worthless and bad\r\nas they are, they have been rendered more so, as I am told, by a\r\ntranslation into French. That I may have neither merit nor demerit not\r\nmy own, I have consented to their publication in England. I advised the\r\nbookseller to send two hundred copies to Philadelphia, and two hundred\r\nto Richmond, supposing that number might be sold in the United States;\r\nbut I do not know whether he will do it. If you will give me leave, I\r\nwill send you a copy of the original impression. I congratulate you, my\r\ndear friend, on the law of your State, for suspending the importation\r\nof slaves, and for the glory you have justly acquired by endeavoring to\r\nprevent it forever. This abomination must have an end. And there is a\r\nsuperior bench reserved in heaven for those who hasten it. The\r\ndistractions of Holland thicken apace. They begin to cut one another's\r\nthroats heartily. I apprehend the neighboring powers will interfere;\r\nbut it is not yet clear whether in concert or by taking opposite sides.\r\nIt is a poor contest, whether they shall have one, or many masters.\r\nYour nephew is arrived here in good health. My first interview with him\r\nhas impressed me much in his favor. Present me very respectfully to\r\nMrs. Rutledge, as well as to your brother and his house. Accept\r\nyourself assurances of the sincere esteem and respect with which I am,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 17, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have been duly honored with yours of the 10th instant, and\r\nam happy to hear of the success of your journey to Amsterdam. There can\r\nbe no doubt of its ratification by Congress. Would to heaven they would\r\nauthorize you to take measures for transferring the debt of this\r\ncountry to Holland, before you leave Europe. Most especially is it\r\nnecessary to get rid of the debt to the officers. Their connections at\r\nCourt are such as to excite very unfavorable feelings there against us,\r\nand some very hard things have been said (particularly in the Assemblee\r\ndes Notables) on the prospect relative to our debts. The payment of the\r\ninterest to the officers would have kept them quiet; but there are two\r\nyears now due to them. I dare not draw for it without instructions,\r\nbecause in the instances in which I have hitherto ventured to act\r\nuninstructed, I have never been able to know whether they have been\r\napproved in the private sentiments of the members of Congress, much\r\nless by any vote. I have pressed on them the expediency of transferring\r\nthe French debts to Holland, in order to remove everything which may\r\nexcite irritations between us and this nation. I wish it may be done\r\nbefore this ministry may receive ill impressions of us. They are at\r\npresent very well disposed. I send you by Mr. Appleton some pamphlets,\r\nand have the honor to be, with sentiments of very cordial esteem, your\r\naffectionate and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOSEPH FENWICK.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 21, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am this moment honored with your letter of the 16th, and wish\r\nit was in my power to give you the information desired on the subject\r\nof tobaccos.\r\n\r\nThe complaint has been universal that the Farmers General have not\r\ncomplied with the order of government. I have, therefore, desired that\r\nthey may be called on to report precisely what tobacco they have\r\npurchased on the terms prescribed by the order, that if it shall appear\r\nthey have not bought the whole quantity, they may be compelled to do it\r\nimmediately. It is impossible to foresee whether any new regulations\r\nwill be made to take place on the expiration of the contract of Mr.\r\nMorris. I shall certainly press for something to be done by way of\r\nantidote to the monopoly under which this article is placed in France.\r\nThe moment anything is decided which may be interesting to our\r\ncommerce, I shall take great care to communicate it to them through Mr.\r\nBondfield; though I do not expect anything interesting to take place\r\nvery soon. I am, with much regard, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO STEPHEN CATHALAN, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 21, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received your favor of May the 9th just as I was stepping into\r\nthe barge on my departure from Cette; which prevented my answering it\r\nfrom that place. On my arrival here, I thought I would avail myself of\r\nthe opportunity of paying your balance, to make a little acquaintance\r\nwith Sir John Lambert. One or two unsuccessful attempts to find him at\r\nhome, with the intermediate procrastinations well known to men of\r\nbusiness, prevented my seeing him till yesterday, and have led me on to\r\nthis moment, through a perpetual remorse of conscience for not writing\r\nto you, and to the constant belief that it would be to-morrow and\r\nto-morrow. At length, I have seen him, paid him the eighty-five livres\r\nwhich you have been so kind as to advance for me, and am actually at my\r\nwriting-table, returning you thanks for this kindness, and to yourself\r\nand the family for the thousand others I received at their hands, at\r\nMarseilles. My journey, after leaving you, wanted nothing but the\r\ncompany of Madame Cathalan and yourself, to render it perfectly\r\nagreeable. I felt the want of it peculiarly on the Canal de Languedoc,\r\nwhere, with society, the mode of travelling would have been charming. I\r\nwas much indebted to M. Minaudier for a good equipment from Agde, and\r\nunceasing attentions to that place; for which I was indebted to your\r\nrecommendations as well as to his goodness.\r\n\r\nI am honored with your father's letter of June the 30th; and, as he\r\ndoes not read English, and I cannot write French, I must beg leave to\r\nanswer him through you. I thank him for his hints on the subject of\r\ntobacco. I am now pressing for arrangements as to that article, to take\r\nplace on the expiration of Mr. Morris' contract, and the order of\r\nBernis. What form this business will take, or what will be the nature\r\nof the arrangements, or whether there will be any, I am as yet unable\r\nto say. I will take care to inform you the moment there is a decision.\r\n\r\nThe public business with which Mr. Barclay has been charged rendering\r\nit necessary for him to repair to Congress, and the interest of his\r\ncreditors, his family and himself requiring his return to America, he\r\nhas departed for that country. I know nothing of Mr. Barclay's affairs\r\nin this country. He has good possessions in America, which, he assured\r\nme, were much more than sufficient to satisfy all the demands against\r\nhim. He went, determined to convert those immediately into money, and\r\nto collect the debts due to him there, that he might be enabled to pay\r\nhis debts. My opinion of his integrity is such, as to leave no doubt in\r\nmy mind, that he will do everything in his power to render justice to\r\nhis creditors, and I know so well his attachment to M. Cathalan, as to\r\nbe satisfied, that if he makes any difference among his creditors, he\r\nwill be among the most favored. Mr. Barclay is an honest and honorable\r\nman, and is more goaded towards the payment of his debts by his own\r\nfeelings, than by all the processes of law which could be set on foot\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nNo arrangements having ever been made as yet, for cases like that of\r\nthe carpenter of the American ship Sally, I am unable to answer on that\r\nsubject. I am in hopes, his money will last till he recovers his\r\nsenses, or till we can receive instructions what to do in that and\r\nsimilar cases.\r\n\r\nMr. Cathalan wishes a copy of my Notes on Virginia. If you will be so\r\ngood as to advise me by what channel they will go safely, I will do\r\nmyself the honor of sending a copy, either of the original or of the\r\ntranslation. Present me affectionately to Mrs. Cathalan, the mother and\r\ndaughter; tell the latter I feed on the hopes of seeing her one day at\r\nParis. My friendly respects wait also on your father; and on yourself,\r\nassurances of the esteem and consideration with which I have the honor\r\nto be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE DELEGATES OF RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 22, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I was honored, in the month of January last, with a letter\r\nfrom the honorable the Delegates of Rhode Island in Congress, enclosing\r\na letter from the corporation of Rhode Island College to his most\r\nChristian Majesty, and some other papers. I was then in the hurry of\r\npreparation for a journey into the south of France, and therefore\r\nunable, at that moment, to make the inquiries which the object of the\r\nletter rendered necessary. As soon as I returned, which was in the last\r\nmonth, I turned my attention to that object, which was the\r\nestablishment of a professorship of the French language in the College,\r\nand the obtaining a collection of the best French authors, with the aid\r\nof the King. That neither the College nor myself might be compromitted\r\nuselessly, I thought it necessary to sound, previously, those who were\r\nable to inform me what would be the success of the application. I was\r\nassured, so as to leave no doubt, that it would not be complied with;\r\nthat there had never been an instance of the King's granting such a\r\ndemand in a foreign country, and that they would be cautious of setting\r\nthe precedent: that, in this moment, too, they were embarrassed with\r\nthe difficult operation of putting down all establishments of their\r\nown, which could possibly be dispensed with, in order to bring their\r\nexpenditures down to the level of their receipts. Upon such information\r\nI was satisfied, that it was most prudent not to deliver the letter,\r\nand spare to both parties the disagreeableness of giving and receiving\r\na denial. The King did give to two colleges in America copies of the\r\nworks printing in the public press. But were this to be obtained for\r\nthe College of Rhode Island, it would extend only to a volume or two of\r\nBuffon's works, still to be printed, Manilius' Astronomicon, and one or\r\ntwo other works in the press, which are of no consequence. I did not\r\nthink this an object for the College, worth being pressed. I beg the\r\nfavor of you, gentlemen, to assure the corporation, that no endeavors\r\nof mine should have been spared, could they have effected their wish;\r\nand that they have been faithfully used in making the preliminary\r\nenquiries which are necessary, and which ended in an assurance that\r\nnothing could be done. These papers having been transmitted to me\r\nthrough your delegation, will, I hope, be an apology for my availing\r\nmyself of the same channel, for communicating the result.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 23, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor, a few days ago, of putting into the hands of\r\nyour Excellency, some observations on the other articles of American\r\nproduce, brought into the ports of this country. That of our tobaccos,\r\nfrom the particular form of their administration here, and their\r\nimportance to the King's revenues, has been placed on a separate line,\r\nand considered separately. I will now ask permission to bring that\r\nsubject under your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe mutual extension of their commerce was among the fairest advantages\r\nto be derived to France and the United States, from the independence of\r\nthe latter. An exportation of eighty millions, chiefly in raw\r\nmaterials, is supposed to constitute the present limits of the commerce\r\nof the United States with the nations of Europe; limits, however, which\r\nextend as their population increases. To draw the best proportion of\r\nthis into the ports of France, rather than of any other nation, is\r\nbelieved to be the wish and interest of both. Of these eighty millions,\r\nthirty are constituted by the single article of tobacco. Could the\r\nwhole of this be brought into the ports of France, to satisfy its own\r\ndemands, and the residue to be re-vended to other nations, it would be\r\na powerful link of commercial connection. But we are far from this.\r\nEven her own consumption, supposed to be nine millions, under the\r\nadministration of the monopoly to which it is farmed, enters little, as\r\nan article of exchange, into the commerce of the two nations. When this\r\narticle was first put into Farm, perhaps it did not injure the\r\ncommercial interests of the kingdom; because nothing but British\r\nmanufactures were then allowed to be given in return for American\r\ntobaccos. The laying the trade open, then, to all the subjects of\r\nFrance, could not have relieved her from a payment in money.\r\nCircumstances are changed; yet the old institution remains. The body to\r\nwhich this monopoly was given, was not mercantile. Their object is to\r\nsimplify as much as possible, the administration of their affairs. They\r\nsell for cash; they purchase, therefore, with cash. Their interest,\r\ntheir principles and their practice, seem opposed to the general\r\ninterest of the kingdom, which would require, that this capital article\r\nshould be laid open to a free exchange for the productions of this\r\ncountry. So far does the spirit of simplifying their operations govern\r\nthis body, that relinquishing the advantages to be derived from a\r\ncompetition of sellers, they contracted some time ago with a single\r\nperson (Mr. Morris), for three years' supplies of American tobacco, to\r\nbe paid for in cash. They obliged themselves too, expressly, to employ\r\nno other person to purchase in America, during that term. In\r\nconsequence of this, the mercantile houses of France, concerned in\r\nsending her productions to be exchanged for tobacco, cut off, for three\r\nyears, from the hope of selling these tobaccos in France, were of\r\nnecessity to abandon that commerce. In consequence of this, too, a\r\nsingle individual, constituted sole purchaser of so great a proportion\r\nof the tobaccos made, had the price in his own power. A great reduction\r\nin it took place, and that, not only on the quantity he bought, but on\r\nthe whole quantity made. The loss to the States producing the article,\r\ndid not go to cheapen it for their friends here. Their price was fixed.\r\nWhat was gained on their consumption, was to enrich the person\r\npurchasing it; the rest, the monopolists and merchants of other\r\ncountries. The effect of this operation was vitally felt by every\r\nfarmer in America, concerned in the culture of this plant. At the end\r\nof the year, he found he had lost a fourth or a third of his revenue;\r\nthe State, the same proportion of its subjects of exchange with other\r\nnations: the manufactures of this country, too, were either not to go\r\nthere at all, or go through the channel of a new monopoly, which, freed\r\nfrom the control of competition in prices and qualities, was not likely\r\nto extend their consumption. It became necessary to relieve the two\r\ncountries from the fatal effects of this double monopoly. I had the\r\nhonor of addressing a letter, on the 15th day of August, 1785, to his\r\nlate excellency, the Count de Vergennes, upon this subject, a copy of\r\nwhich I do myself the honor herein to enclose. The effectual mode of\r\nrelief was to lay the commerce open. But the King's interest was also\r\nto be guarded. A committee was appointed to take this matter into\r\nconsideration; and the result was, an order to the Farmers General,\r\nthat no such contract should be made again. And to furnish such aliment\r\nas might keep that branch of commerce alive, till the expiration of the\r\npresent contract, they were required to put the merchants in general,\r\non a level with Mr. Morris, for the quantity of twelve or fifteen\r\nthousand hogsheads a year. That this relief, too, might not be\r\nintercepted from the merchants of the two suffering nations by those of\r\na neighboring one, and that the transportation of so bulky an article\r\nmight go to nourish their own shipping, no tobaccos were to be counted\r\nof this purchase, but those brought in French or American vessels. Of\r\nthis order, made at Bernis, his Excellency, Count de Vergennes, was\r\npleased to honor me with a communication, by a letter of the 30th of\r\nMay, 1786, desiring that I would publish it as well in America, as to\r\nthe American merchants in France. I did so; communicating it to\r\nCongress at the same time. This order, thus viewed with the\r\ntransactions which produced it, will be seen to have been necessary;\r\nand its punctual and candid execution has been rendered still more so,\r\nby the speculations of the merchants, entered into on the faith of it.\r\nOtherwise, it would become the instrument of their ruin instead of\r\ntheir relief. A twelve month has elapsed some time since; and it is\r\nquestioned whether the Farmers General have purchased, within that\r\ntime, the quantity prescribed, and on the conditions prescribed. It\r\nwould be impossible for the merchants to prove the negative; it will be\r\neasy for the Farmers General to show the affirmative, if it exists. I\r\nhope that a branch of commerce of this extent will be thought\r\ninteresting enough to both nations, to render it the desire of your\r\nExcellency to require, as I deem it my duty to ask, a report of the\r\npurchases they have made, according to the conditions of the order of\r\nBernis, specifying, in that report, 1, the quantities purchased; 2, the\r\nprices paid; 3, the dates of the purchase and payment; 4, the flag of\r\nthe vessel in which imported; 5, her name; 6, her port of delivery; and\r\n7, the name of the seller. The four first articles make part of the\r\nconditions required by the order of Bernis; the three last may be\r\nnecessary for the correction of any errors which should happen to arise\r\nin the report.\r\n\r\nBut the order of Bernis was never considered but as a temporary relief.\r\nThe radical evil will still remain. There will be but one purchaser in\r\nthe kingdom, and the hazard of his refusal will damp every mercantile\r\nspeculation. It is very much to be desired, that before the expiration\r\nof this order, some measure may be devised, which may bring this great\r\narticle into free commerce between the two nations. Had this been\r\npracticable at the time it was put into Farm, that mode of collecting\r\nthe revenue would probably never have been adopted; now that it has\r\nbecome practicable, it seems reasonable to discontinue this mode, and\r\nto substitute some of those practised on other imported articles, on\r\nwhich a revenue is levied, without absolutely suppressing them in\r\ncommerce. If the revenue can be secured, the interests of a few\r\nindividuals will hardly be permitted to weigh against those of as many\r\nmillions, equally subjects of his Majesty, and against those, too, of a\r\nnation allied to him by all the ties of treaty, of interest and of\r\naffection. The privileges of the most favored nation, have been\r\nmutually exchanged by treaty. But the productions of other nations,\r\nwhich do not rival those of France, are suffered to be bought and sold\r\nfreely within the kingdom. By prohibiting all his Majesty's subjects\r\nfrom dealing in tobacco, except with a single company, one third of the\r\nexports of the United States are rendered uncommerciable here. This\r\nproduction is so peculiarly theirs, that its shackles affect no other\r\nnation. A relief from these shackles, will form a memorable epoch in\r\nthe commerce of the two nations. It will establish at once a great\r\nbasis of exchange, serving like a point of union to draw to it other\r\nmembers of our commerce. Nature, too, has conveniently assorted our\r\nwants and our superfluities, to each other. Each nation has exactly to\r\nspare, the articles which the other wants. We have a surplus of rice,\r\ntobacco, furs, peltry, potash, lamp oils, timber, which France wants;\r\nshe has a surplus of wines, brandies, esculent oils, fruits and\r\nmanufactures of all kinds, which we want. The governments have nothing\r\nto do, but _not to hinder_ their merchants from making the exchange.\r\nThe difference of language, laws and customs, will be some obstacle for\r\na time; but the interest of the merchants will surmount them. A more\r\nserious obstacle is our debt to Great Britain. Yet, since the treaty\r\nbetween this country and that, I should not despair of seeing that debt\r\npaid, in part, with the productions of France, if our produce can\r\nobtain here, a free course of exchange for them. The distant prospect\r\nis still more promising. A century's experience has shown, that we\r\ndouble our numbers every twenty or twenty-five years. No circumstance\r\ncan be foreseen, at this moment, which will lessen our rate of\r\nmultiplication for centuries to come. For every article of the\r\nproductions and manufactures of this country, then, which can be\r\nintroduced into the habit there, the demand will double every twenty or\r\ntwenty-five years. And to introduce the habit, we have only to let the\r\nmerchants alone. Whether we may descend, by a single step, from the\r\npresent state, to that of perfect freedom of commerce in this article,\r\nwhether any, and what, intermediate operation may be necessary to\r\nprepare the way to this, what cautions must be observed for the\r\nsecurity of his Majesty's revenue, which we do not wish to impair, will\r\nrest with the wisdom of his ministers, whose knowledge of the subject\r\nwill enable them to devise the best plans, and whose patriotism and\r\njustice will dispose them to pursue them. To the friendly dispositions\r\nof your Excellency, of which we have had such early and multiplied\r\nproofs, I take the liberty of committing this subject, particularly\r\ntrusting that some method may be devised, of reconciling the collection\r\nof his Majesty's revenues, with the interests of the two nations; and\r\nhave the honor of assuring you, of those sincere sentiments of esteem\r\nand respect, with which I am your Excellency's most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SKIPWITH.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 28, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A long journey has prevented me from writing to any of my\r\nfriends, for some time past. This was undertaken with a view to benefit\r\na dislocated and ill-set wrist, by the mineral waters of Aix, in\r\nProvence. Finding this hope vain, I was led from other views to cross\r\nthe Alps as far as Turin, Milan, Genoa; to follow the Mediterranean as\r\nfar as Cette, the canal of Languedoc, the Garonne, etc., to Paris. A\r\nmost pleasing journey it proved; arts and agriculture offering\r\nsomething new at every step, and often things worth our imitation. But\r\nthe accounts from our country give me to believe that we are not in a\r\ncondition to hope for the imitation of anything good. All my letters\r\nare filled with details of our extravagance. From these accounts, I\r\nlook back to the time of the war as a time of happiness and enjoyment,\r\nwhen amidst the privation of many things not essential to happiness, we\r\ncould not run in debt, because nobody would trust us; when we practised\r\nby necessity the maxim of buying nothing but what we had money in our\r\npockets to pay for; a maxim which, of all others, lays the broadest\r\nfoundation for happiness. I see no remedy to our evils, but an open\r\ncourse of law. Harsh as it may seem, it would relieve the very patients\r\nwho dread it, by stopping the course of their extravagance, before it\r\nrenders their affairs entirely desperate. The eternal and bitter\r\nstrictures on our conduct which teem in every London paper, and are\r\ncopied from them into others, fill me with anxiety on this subject. The\r\nstate of things in Europe is rather threatening at this moment. The\r\ninnovations of the Emperor in his dominions have excited a spirit of\r\nresistance. His subjects in Brabant and Flanders are arming, and he has\r\nput forty-five thousand troops in motion towards that country. I\r\nbelieve they will come to blows. The parties in Holland have already\r\nspilt too much blood to be easily stopped. If left to themselves, I\r\napprehend the Stadtholderians will be too strong; and if foreign powers\r\ninterfere, the weight is still on their side. England and Prussia will\r\nbe too much for France. As it is certain that neither of these powers\r\nwish for war, and that England and France are particularly averse to\r\nit, perhaps the matter may end in an armed mediation. If the mediators\r\nshould not agree, they will draw their negotiations into length, and\r\ntrust to the chapter of accidents for their final solution. With\r\nrespect to our country, it stands well with the present ministry here.\r\nThe non-payment of our debt is against us. We are occupied in procuring\r\nfavorable terms of reception for our produce.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Sir, and be assured of the sentiments of sincere esteem\r\nof your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. W. EPPES.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 28, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR JACK,--The letter which you were so kind as to write to me the 22d\r\nof May, 1786, was not delivered to me till the 3d of May, 1787, when it\r\nfound me in the neighborhood of Marseilles. Before that time, you must\r\nhave taken your degree, as mentioned in your letter. Those public\r\ntestimonies which are earned by merit, and not by solicitation, may\r\nalways be accepted without the imputation of vanity. Of this nature is\r\nthe degree which your masters proposed to confer on you. I congratulate\r\nyou sincerely on it. It will be a pleasing event to yourself; it will\r\nbe the same to your parents and friends, and to none more than myself.\r\nGo on deserving applause, and you will be sure to meet with it; and the\r\nway to deserve it is, to be good, and to be industrious. I am sure you\r\nwill be good, and hope you will be industrious. As to your future plan,\r\nI am too distant from you to advise you on sure grounds. In general, I\r\nam of opinion, that till the age of about sixteen, we are best employed\r\non languages; Latin, Greek, French, and Spanish, or such of them as we\r\ncan. After this, I think the College of William and Mary the best place\r\nto go through the courses of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy in its\r\ndifferent branches, and Law. Of the languages I have mentioned, I think\r\nGreek the least useful. Write me word, from time to time, how you go\r\non. I shall always be glad to assist you with any books you may have\r\noccasion for, and you may count with certainty on every service I can\r\never render you, as well as on the sincere esteem of, dear Jack, yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALEXANDER DONALD.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 28, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received with infinite satisfaction your letter of the 1st\r\nof March; it was the first information I had of your being in America.\r\nThere is no person whom I shall see again with more cordial joy,\r\nwhenever it shall be my lot to return to my native country; nor any one\r\nwhose prosperity in the meantime will be more interesting to me. I\r\nfind, as I grow older, that I set a higher value on the intimacies of\r\nmy youth, and am more afflicted by whatever loses one of them to me.\r\nShould it be in my power to render any service in your shipment of\r\ntobacco to Havre de Grace, I shall do it with great pleasure. The order\r\nof Bernis has, I believe, been evaded by the Farmers General as much as\r\npossible. At this moment, I receive information from most of the\r\nseaports, that they refuse taking any tobacco, under the pretext that\r\nthey have purchased their whole quantity. From Havre I have heard\r\nnothing, and believe you will stand a better chance there than anywhere\r\nelse. Being one of the ports of manufacture, too, it is entitled to a\r\nhigher price. I have now desired, that the Farmers may make a distinct\r\nreturn of their purchases, which are conformable to the order of\r\nBernis. If they have really bought their quantity, _on those terms_, we\r\nmust be satisfied; if they have not, I shall propose their being\r\nobliged to make it up instantly. There is a considerable accumulation\r\nof tobacco in the ports.\r\n\r\nAmong many good qualities which my countrymen possess, some of a\r\ndifferent character unhappily mix themselves. The most remarkable are,\r\nindolence, extravagance, and infidelity to their engagements. Cure the\r\ntwo first, and the last would disappear, because it is a consequence of\r\nthem, and not proceeding from a want of morals. I know of no remedy\r\nagainst indolence and extravagance, but a free course of justice.\r\nEverything else is merely palliative; but unhappily, the evil has\r\ngained too generally the mass of the nation, to leave the course of\r\njustice unobstructed. The maxim of buying nothing without the money in\r\nour pockets to pay for it, would make of our country one of the\r\nhappiest upon earth. Experience during the war proved this; as I think\r\nevery man will remember, that under all the privations it obliged him\r\nto submit to, during that period, he slept sounder, and awaked happier\r\nthan he can do now. Desperate of finding relief from a free course of\r\njustice, I look forward to the abolition of all credit, as the only\r\nother remedy which can take place. I have seen, therefore, with\r\npleasure, the exaggerations of our want of faith, with which the London\r\npapers teem. It is indeed, a strong medicine for sensible minds, but it\r\nis a medicine. It will prevent their crediting us abroad, in which case\r\nwe cannot be credited at home. I have been much concerned at the losses\r\nproduced by the fire of Richmond. I hope you have escaped them. It will\r\ngive me much pleasure to hear from you, as often as you can spare a\r\nmoment to write. Be assured that nobody entertains for you sentiments\r\nof more perfect and sincere esteem than, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM DRAYTON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, July 30, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--Having observed that the consumption of rice in this country, and\r\nparticularly in this capital, was very great, I thought it my duty to\r\ninform myself from what markets they draw their supplies, in what\r\nproportion from ours, and whether it might not be practicable to\r\nincrease that proportion. This city being little concerned in foreign\r\ncommerce, it is difficult to obtain information on particular branches\r\nof it in the detail. I addressed myself to the retailers of rice, and\r\nfrom them received a mixture of truth and error, which I was unable to\r\nsift apart in the first moment. Continuing, however, my inquiries, they\r\nproduced at length this result: that the dealers here were in the habit\r\nof selling two qualities of rice, that of Carolina, with which they\r\nwere supplied chiefly from England, and that of Piedmont; that the\r\nCarolina rice was long, slender, white and transparent, answers well\r\nwhen prepared with milk, sugar, &c., but not so well when prepared _au\r\ngras_; that that of Piedmont was shorter, thicker, and less white, but\r\nthat it presented its form better when dressed _au gras_, was better\r\ntasted, and, therefore, preferred by good judges for those purposes;\r\nthat the consumption of rice, in this form, was much the most\r\nconsiderable, but that the superior beauty of the Carolina rice,\r\nseducing the eye of those purchasers who are attached to appearances,\r\nthe demand for it was upon the whole as great as for that of Piedmont.\r\nThey supposed this difference of quality to proceed from a difference\r\nof management; that the Carolina rice was husked with an instrument\r\nthat broke it more, and that less pains were taken to separate the\r\nbroken from the unbroken grains, imagining that it was the broken\r\ngrains which dissolved in oily preparations; that the Carolina rice\r\ncosts somewhat less than that of Piedmont; but that being obliged to\r\nsort the whole grains from the broken, in order to satisfy the taste of\r\ntheir customers, they ask and receive as much for the first quality of\r\nCarolina, when sorted, as for the rice of Piedmont; but the second and\r\nthird qualities, obtained by sorting, are sold much cheaper. The\r\nobjection to the Carolina rice then, being, that it crumbles in certain\r\nforms of preparation, and this supposed to be the effect of a less\r\nperfect machine for husking, I flattered myself I should be able to\r\nlearn what might be the machine of Piedmont, when I should arrive at\r\nMarseilles, to which place I was to go in the course of a tour through\r\nthe seaport towns of this country. At Marseilles, however, they\r\ndiffered as much in account of the machines, as at Paris they had\r\ndiffered about other circumstances. Some said it was husked between\r\nmill-stones, others between rubbers of wood in the form of mill-stones,\r\nothers of cork. They concurred in one fact, however, that the machine\r\nmight be seen by me, immediately on crossing the Alps. This would be an\r\naffair of three weeks. I crossed them and went through the rice country\r\nfrom Vercelli to Pavia, about sixty miles. I found the machine to be\r\nabsolutely the same with that used in Carolina, as well as I could\r\nrecollect a description which Mr. E. Rutledge had given me of it. It is\r\non the plan of a powder mill. In some of them, indeed, they arm each\r\npestle with an iron tooth, consisting of nine spikes hooked together,\r\nwhich I do not remember in the description of Mr. Rutledge. I therefore\r\nhad a tooth made, which I have the honor of forwarding you with this\r\nletter; observing, at the same time, that as many of their machines are\r\nwithout teeth as with them, and of course, that the advantage is not\r\nvery palpable. It seems to follow, then, that the rice of Lombardy (for\r\nthough called Piedmont rice, it does not grow in that county but in\r\nLombardy) is of a different species from that of Carolina; different in\r\nform, in color and in quality. We know that in Asia they have several\r\ndistinct species of this grain. Monsieur Poivre, a former Governor of\r\nthe Isle of France, in travelling through several countries of Asia,\r\nobserved with particular attention the objects of their agriculture,\r\nand he tells us, that in Cochin-China they cultivate six several kinds\r\nof rice, which he describes, three of them requiring water, and three\r\ngrowing on highlands. The rice of Carolina is said to have come from\r\nMadagascar, and De Poivre tells us, it is the white rice which is\r\ncultivated there. This favors the probability of its being of a\r\ndifferent species originally, from that of Piedmont; and time, culture\r\nand climate may have made it still more different. Under this idea, I\r\nthought it would be well to furnish you with some of the Piedmont rice,\r\nunhusked, but was told it was contrary to the laws to export it in that\r\nform. I took such measures as I could, however, to have a quantity\r\nbrought out, and lest these should fail, I brought, myself, a few\r\npounds. A part of this I have addressed to you by the way of London; a\r\npart comes with this letter; and I shall send another parcel by some\r\nother conveyance, to prevent the danger of miscarriage. Any one of them\r\narriving safe, may serve to put in seed, should the society think it an\r\nobject. This seed too, coming from Vercelli, where the best rice is\r\nsupposed to grow, is more to be depended on than what may be sent me\r\nhereafter. There is a rice from the Levant, which is considered as of a\r\nquality still different, and some think it superior to that of\r\nPiedmont. The troubles which have existed in that country for several\r\nyears back, have intercepted it from the European market, so that it is\r\nbecome almost unknown. I procured a bag of it, however, at Marseilles,\r\nand another of the best rice of Lombardy, which are on their way to\r\nthis place, and when arrived, I will forward you a quantity of each,\r\nsufficient to enable you to judge of their qualities when prepared for\r\nthe table. I have also taken measures to have a quantity of it brought\r\nfrom the Levant, unhusked. If I succeed, it shall be forwarded in like\r\nmanner. I should think it certainly advantageous to cultivate, in\r\nCarolina and Georgia, the two qualities demanded at market; because the\r\nprogress of culture, with us, may soon get beyond the demand for the\r\nwhite rice; and because too, there is often a brisk demand for the one\r\nquality, when the market is glutted with the other. I should hope there\r\nwould be no danger of losing the species of white rice, by a confusion\r\nwith the other. This would be a real misfortune, as I should not\r\nhesitate to pronounce the white, upon the whole, the most precious of\r\nthe two, for us. The dry rice of Cochin-China has the reputation of\r\nbeing the whitest to the eye, best flavored to the taste, and most\r\nproductive. It seems then to unite the good qualities of both the\r\nothers known to us. Could it supplant them, it would be a great\r\nhappiness, as it would enable us to get rid of those ponds of stagnant\r\nwater, so fatal to human health and life. But such is the force of\r\nhabit, and caprice of taste, that we could not be sure beforehand it\r\nwould produce this effect. The experiment, however, is worth trying,\r\nshould it only end in producing a third quality, and increasing the\r\ndemand. I will endeavor to procure some to be brought from\r\nCochin-China. The event, however, will be uncertain and distant.\r\n\r\nI was induced, in the course of my journey through the south of France,\r\nto pay very particular attention to the objects of their culture,\r\nbecause the resemblance of their climate to that of the southern parts\r\nof the United States, authorizes us to presume we may adopt any of\r\ntheir articles of culture, which we would wish for. We should not wish\r\nfor their wines, though they are good and abundant. The culture of the\r\nvine is not desirable in lands capable of producing anything else. It\r\nis a species of gambling, and of desperate gambling too, wherein,\r\nwhether you make much or nothing, you are equally ruined. The middling\r\ncrop alone is the saving point, and that the seasons seldom hit.\r\nAccordingly, we see much wretchedness among this class of cultivators.\r\nWine, too, is so cheap in these countries, that a laborer with us,\r\nemployed in the culture of any other article, may exchange it for wine,\r\nmore and better than he could raise himself. It is a resource for a\r\ncountry, the whole of whose good soil is otherwise employed, and which\r\nstill has some barren spots, and surplus of population to employ on\r\nthem. There the vine is good, because it is something in the place of\r\nnothing. It may become a resource to us at a still earlier period; when\r\nthe increase of population shall increase our productions beyond the\r\ndemand for them, both at home and abroad. Instead of going on to make\r\nan useless surplus of them, we may employ our supernumerary hands on\r\nthe vine. But that period is not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nThe almond tree is also so precarious, that none can depend for\r\nsubsistence on its produce, but persons of capital.\r\n\r\nThe caper, though a more tender plant, is more certain in its produce,\r\nbecause a mound of earth of the size of a cucumber hill, thrown over\r\nthe plant in the fall, protects it effectually against the cold of\r\nwinter. When the danger of frost is over in the spring, they uncover\r\nit, and begin its culture. There is a great deal of this in the\r\nneighborhood of Toulon. The plants are set about eight feet apart, and\r\nyield, one year with another, about two pounds of caper each, worth on\r\nthe spot sixpence sterling per pound. They require little culture, and\r\nthis may be performed either with the plough or hoe. The principal work\r\nis the gathering of the fruit as it forms. Every plant must be picked\r\nevery other day, from the last of June till the middle of October. But\r\nthis is the work of women and children. This plant does well in any\r\nkind of soil which is dry, or even in walls where there is no soil, and\r\nit lasts the life of a man. Toulon would be the proper port to apply\r\nfor them. I must observe, that the preceding details cannot be relied\r\non with the fullest certainty, because, in the canton where this plant\r\nis cultivated, the inhabitants speak no written language, but a medley,\r\nwhich I could understand but very imperfectly.\r\n\r\nThe fig and mulberry are so well known in America, that nothing need be\r\nsaid of them. Their culture, too, is by women and children, and,\r\ntherefore, earnestly to be desired in countries where there are slaves.\r\nIn these, the women and children are often employed in labors\r\ndisproportioned to their sex and age. By presenting to the master\r\nobjects of culture, easier and equally beneficial, all temptation to\r\nmisemploy them would be removed, and the lot of this tender part of our\r\nspecies be much softened. By varying, too, the articles of culture, we\r\nmultiply the chances for making something, and disarm the seasons in a\r\nproportionable degree, of their calamitous effects.\r\n\r\nThe olive is a tree the least known in America, and yet the most worthy\r\nof being known. Of all the gifts of heaven to man, it is next to the\r\nmost precious, if it be not the most precious. Perhaps it may claim a\r\npreference even to bread, because there is such an infinitude of\r\nvegetables, which it renders a proper and comfortable nourishment. In\r\npassing the Alps at the Col de Tende, where they are mere masses of\r\nrock, wherever there happens to be a little soil, there are a number of\r\nolive trees, and a village supported by them. Take away these trees,\r\nand the same ground in corn would not support a single family. A pound\r\nof oil, which can be bought for three or four pence sterling, is\r\nequivalent to many pounds of flesh, by the quantity of vegetables it\r\nwill prepare, and render fit and comfortable food. Without this tree,\r\nthe country of Provence and territory of Genoa would not support\r\none-half, perhaps not one-third, their present inhabitants. The nature\r\nof the soil is of little consequence if it be dry. The trees are\r\nplanted from fifteen to twenty feet apart, and when tolerably good,\r\nwill yield fifteen or twenty pounds of oil yearly, one with another.\r\nThere are trees which yield much more. They begin to render good crops\r\nat twenty years old, and last till killed by cold, which happens at\r\nsome time or other, even in their best positions in France. But they\r\nput out again from their roots. In Italy, I am told, they have trees\r\ntwo hundred years old. They afford an easy but constant employment\r\nthrough the year, and require so little nourishment, that if the soil\r\nbe fit for any other production, it may be cultivated among the olive\r\ntrees without injuring them. The northern limits of this tree are the\r\nmountains of the Cevennes, from about the meridian of Carcassonne to\r\nthe Rhone, and from thence, the Alps and Apennines as far as Genoa, I\r\nknow, and how much farther I am not informed. The shelter of these\r\nmountains may be considered as equivalent to a degree and a half of\r\nlatitude, at least, because westward of the commencement of the\r\nCevennes, there are no olive trees in 43-1/2 deg. or even 43 deg. of latitude,\r\nwhereas, we find them _now_ on the Rhone at Pierrelatte, in 44-1/2 deg.,\r\nand _formerly_ they were at Tains, above the mouth of the Isere, in\r\n45 deg., sheltered by the near approach of the Cevennes and Alps, which\r\nonly leave there a passage for the Rhone. Whether such a shelter exists\r\nor not in the States of South Carolina and Georgia, I know not. But\r\nthis we may say, either that it exists or that it is not necessary\r\nthere, because we know that they produce the orange in open air; and\r\nwherever the orange will stand at all, experience shows that the olive\r\nwill stand well, being a hardier tree. Notwithstanding the great\r\nquantities of oil made in France, they have not enough for their own\r\nconsumption, and, therefore, import from other countries. This is an\r\narticle, the consumption of which will always keep pace with its\r\nproduction. Raise it, and it begets its own demand. Little is carried\r\nto America, because Europe has it not to spare. We, therefore, have not\r\nlearned the use of it. But cover the southern States with it, and every\r\nman will become a consumer of oil, within whose reach it can be brought\r\nin point of price. If the memory of those persons is held in great\r\nrespect in South Carolina who introduced there the culture of rice, a\r\nplant which sows life and death with almost equal hand, what\r\nobligations would be due to him who should introduce the olive tree,\r\nand set the example of its culture! Were the owner of slaves to view it\r\nonly as the means of bettering their condition, how much would he\r\nbetter that by planting one of those trees for every slave he\r\npossessed! Having been myself an eye witness to the blessings which\r\nthis tree sheds on the poor, I never had my wishes so kindled for the\r\nintroduction of any article of new culture into our own country. South\r\nCarolina and Georgia appear to me to be the States, wherein its\r\nsuccess, in favorable positions at least, could not be doubted, and I\r\nflattered myself it would come within the views of the society for\r\nagriculture to begin the experiments which are to prove its\r\npracticability. Carcassonne is the place from which the plants may be\r\nmost certainly and cheaply obtained. They can be sent from thence by\r\nwater to Bordeaux, where they may be embarked on vessels bound for\r\nCharleston. There is too little intercourse between Charleston and\r\nMarseilles to propose this as the port of exportation. I offer my\r\nservices to the society for the obtaining and forwarding any number of\r\nplants which may be desired.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit the subject of climates, and the plants adapted to them,\r\nI will add, as a matter of curiosity, and of some utility, too, that my\r\njourney through the southern parts of France, and the territory of\r\nGenoa, but still more the crossing of the Alps, enabled me to form a\r\nscale of the tenderer plants, and to arrange them according to their\r\ndifferent powers of resisting cold. In passing the Alps at the Col de\r\nTende, we cross three very high mountains successively. In ascending,\r\nwe lose these plants, one after another, as we rise, and find them\r\nagain in the contrary order as we descend on the other side; and this\r\nis repeated three times. Their order, proceeding from the tenderest to\r\nthe hardiest, is as follows: caper, orange, palm, aloe, olive,\r\npomegranate, walnut, fig, almond. But this must be understood of the\r\nplant only; for as to the fruit, the order is somewhat different. The\r\ncaper, for example, is the tenderest plant, yet, being so easily\r\nprotected, it is among the most certain in its fruit. The almond, the\r\nhardiest, loses its fruit the oftenest, on account of its forwardness.\r\nThe palm, hardier than the caper and orange, never produces perfect\r\nfruit here.\r\n\r\nI had the honor of sending you, the last year, some seeds of the sulla\r\nof Malta, or Spanish St. Foin. Lest they should have miscarried, I now\r\npack with the rice a canister of the same kind of seed, raised by\r\nmyself. By Colonel Franks, in the month of February last, I sent a\r\nparcel of acorns of the cork oak, which I desired him to ask the favor\r\nof the Delegates of South Carolina in Congress to forward to you.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FRANCIS HOPKINSON, ESQ.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 1, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A journey into the southern parts of France and northern of\r\nItaly must apologize to you for the length of time elapsed since my\r\nlast, and for the delay of acknowledging the receipt of your favors of\r\nNovember 8 and December 9, 1786, and April 14, 1787. Your two phials of\r\nessence de l'Orient arrived during that interval, and got separated\r\nfrom the letters which accompanied them, so that I could not be sure\r\nwhich was your first preparation, and which was your second. But I\r\nsuppose, from some circumstances, that the small phial was the first,\r\nand the larger one the second. This was entirely spoiled, so that\r\nnothing was distinguishable from it. The matter in the small phial was\r\nalso too much spoiled for use; but the pearl merchant, from whom I got\r\nmy details, said he could judge, from what remained, that it had been\r\nvery good; that you had a very considerable knowledge in the manner of\r\npreparing, but that there was still one thing wanting which made the\r\nsecret of the art; that this is not only a secret of the art, but of\r\nevery individual workman who will not communicate to his fellows,\r\nbelieving his own method the best; that of ten different workmen, all\r\nwill practice different operations, and only one of the ten be the\r\nright one; that the secret consists only in preparing the fish, all the\r\nother parts of the process in the pearl manufactory being known. That\r\nexperience has proved it to be absolutely impossible for the matter to\r\ncross the sea without being spoiled; but that if you will send some in\r\nthe best state you can, he will make pearls of it, and send to you that\r\nyou may judge of them yourself. He says the only possible method of\r\nmaking anything of it would be for a workman to go over. He would not\r\nengage in this, nor would he buy, because he says it is their custom to\r\nhave contracts for nine years' supply from the fishermen, and that his\r\ncontract furnishes him with as much as he can sell in the present\r\ndeclining state of the pearl trade; that they have been long getting\r\nout of fashion, polite people not wearing them at all, and the poor not\r\nable to give a price; that their calling is, in fact, annihilating;\r\nthat when he renews his contract he shall be obliged to reduce the\r\nprice he pays twenty-five per cent.; that the matter sells from five to\r\neight livres the French pound, but most generally at six livres. He\r\nshowed me a necklace of twelve strands, which used to sell at ten\r\nlivres, and now sells for two and a half. He observed that the length\r\nof time the matter will keep depends on the strength of the spirit of\r\nwine. The result is, then, that you must send me a sample of your very\r\nbest, and write what you would propose after weighing these\r\ncircumstances. The leg and feathers of the bird are also arrived; but\r\nthe comb, which you mention as annexed to the foot, has totally\r\ndisappeared. I suppose this is the effect of its drying. I have not yet\r\nhad an opportunity of giving it to Monsieur de Buffon, but expect to do\r\nit soon. I thank you for the trouble you have taken with Madame\r\nChampne's letters, and must give you another, that of enquiring for\r\nJames Lillie, belonging to the privateer General Mercer, of\r\nPhiladelphia, the property of Iroon, Carsons and Semple. Richard Graham\r\n& Co., merchants of Philadelphia, seem to have been also interested;\r\nand Isaac Robinson, Graham's son-in-law, to have commanded her. For the\r\ndetails I refer you to the enclosed paper I received from a Madame\r\nFerrier, sister to James Lillie, from which you will perceive he has\r\nnot been heard of since 1779. I receive many of these applications\r\nwhich humanity cannot refuse, and I have no means of complying with\r\nthem but by troubling gentlemen on the spot. This, I hope, will be my\r\napology. I am obliged to you for subscribing to the Columbian Magazine\r\nfor me. I find it a good thing, and am sure it will be better from the\r\ntime you have undertaken it. I wish you had commenced before the month\r\nof December, for then the abominable forgery inserted in my name in the\r\nlast page, would never have appeared. This, I suppose, the compilers\r\ntook from English papers, those infamous fountains of falsehood. Is it\r\nnot surprising that our newswriters continue to copy from those papers,\r\nthough every one who knows anything of them, knows they are written by\r\npersons who never go out of their garret nor read a paper? The real\r\nletter alluded to was never meant to have been public, and therefore\r\nwas hastily and carelessly dictated while I was obliged to use the pen\r\nof another. It became public, however. I send you a genuine copy to\r\njustify myself in your eyes against the absurd thing they have fathered\r\nupon me in the Magazine. Mr. Payne is here with his bridge, which is\r\nwell thought of. The Academy, to whom it is submitted, have not yet\r\nmade their report. I have shipped on board the Mary, Captain Howland,\r\nbound from Havre to New York, a box containing the subsequent\r\nlivraisons of the Encyclopedie for yourself and Doctor Franklin from\r\nthose formerly sent you to the twenty-two inclusive. I think there are\r\nalso in it some new volumes of the Bibliotheque physico-economique for\r\nyou. I had received duplicates of some books (in sheets) for the\r\ncolleges of Philadelphia and Williamsburg. Whether I packed one copy in\r\nyour box, and one in Madison's, or both in his, I do not remember. You\r\nwill see and be so good as to deliver the one to the College of\r\nPhiladelphia, if in your box. The box is directed to Doctor Franklin,\r\nand will be delivered to Mr. Madison at New York. I will send you\r\neither by this occasion or the next, the cost, expenses, etc., etc.\r\nPresent me in the most respectful and friendly terms to Dr. Franklin\r\nand his grandson, to Mr. Rittenhouse and family, Mrs. Hopkinson the\r\nelder and younger. My daughter (my elder one I mean, for both are here\r\nnow) presents her respects also to your mother. I am, with sentiments\r\nof sincere affection, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RALPH IZARD, ESQ.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 1, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am to thank you for the laws and newspapers sent me by the\r\nM. de Chateaufort. Your favor of April 4th, has also been duly\r\nreceived. I am happy to find that the idea of diverting the rice trade\r\nfrom England to France is thought to be impracticable. A journey which\r\nI made from Marseilles lately, in Lombardy, in order to acquire\r\ninformation relative to their rice, has corrected the misinformation\r\nwhich the retailers of rice in this capital had given me. I am\r\nsatisfied that the rice of Lombardy is of a different species from\r\nyours. The exportation of it in the husk being prohibited, I could not\r\nbring with me but as much as my pockets would hold, which I have sent\r\nto your society of agriculture. It may serve to raise seed from. I have\r\ntaken measures for a couple of sacks, but I do not make sure of them,\r\nnor rely so much on their quality as on the parcel I brought myself. I\r\nhave written so fully on this subject to Mr. Drayton, that, without\r\nrepeating it here, I will take the liberty of referring you to that\r\nletter. I have endeavored to prevail upon the merchants in this country\r\nto engage in the rice trade. I enclose you the proposals of Messrs.\r\nBerard & Co., for that effect. They are a very solid house. One of them\r\nresides here. Their principal establishment is at L'Orient, where they\r\nwould prefer receiving consignments of rice; but they will receive them\r\nanywhere else, and should suppose Honfleur the best port, and next to\r\nthat Bordeaux. You observe they will answer bills to the amount of\r\ntwelve or fifteen livres the French quintal, if accompanying the bill\r\nof lading, and will pay the surplus of the proceeds as soon as\r\nreceived. If they sell at Havre or Rouen, they may receive ready money,\r\nand of course pay the balance soon; if they sell at Paris, it must be\r\non a year's credit (because this will be to the retailers). The money,\r\ntherefore, will be received later, but it will be at least six livres\r\nthe quintal more; a difference well worth waiting for. I know of no\r\nmercantile house in France of surer bottom.\r\n\r\nAffairs in Europe seem to threaten war. Yet I think all may be settled\r\nwithout it. The Emperor disapproves of the concessions made to the\r\nNetherlands by their governors, but called for deputies to consult on\r\nthe matter. They have sent deputies without power to yield a jot, and\r\ngo on arming. From the character of their Sovereign, it is probable he\r\nwill avail himself of this deputation to concede their demands. The\r\naffairs of Holland are so thoroughly embroiled, that they would\r\ncertainly produce a war if France and England were in a condition for\r\nit. But they are not, and they will, therefore, find out some\r\narrangement either perpetual or temporary to stop the progress of the\r\ncivil war begun in that country. A spirit of distrust in the government\r\nhere, and confidence in their own force and rights, is pervading all\r\nranks. It will be well if it awaits the good which will be worked by\r\nthe provincial assemblies, and will content itself with that. The\r\nparliament demand an assembly of the States; they are supported by the\r\nministers of the nation, and the object of asking that assembly is to\r\nfix a constitution, and to limit expenses. They refuse to register any\r\nedict for a new tax. This has so far lessened the credit of government,\r\nthat the purse of the money lender is shut. They speak here as freely\r\nas Junius wrote. Yet it is possible that in the event of war, the\r\nspirit of the nation would rise to support a cause which is approved--I\r\nmean that of Holland.\r\n\r\nI have had the Messrs. Le Coulteux sounded on the subject of lending\r\nmoney. I had before tried the same thing with others. But nothing is to\r\nbe obtained for persons on our side the water. They have no confidence\r\nin our laws. Besides, all the money men are playing deeply in the\r\nstocks of the country. The spirit of \"_agiotage_\" (as they call it) was\r\nnever so high in any country before. It will probably produce as total\r\ndeprivation of morals as the system of law did. All the money of France\r\nis now employed in this, none being free even for the purposes of\r\ncommerce, which suffers immensely from this cause.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude, I must add, on the subject of rice, that, what\r\ncannot arrive here a month before the careme, would miss its sale, and\r\nmust therefore go to another market. The merchant, however, to whom it\r\nis consigned, will be competent to this measure whenever he finds it a\r\nnecessary one. I beg leave to be presented very respectfully to Mrs.\r\nIzard and your family, and to assure you of the sincere sentiments of\r\nesteem and attachment with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 2, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last was of June the 20th. Yours, received since that\r\ndate, are of May the 15th, and June the 6th. In mine I acknowledged the\r\nreceipt of the paccan nuts which came sealed up. I have reason to\r\nbelieve those in the box have arrived at L'Orient. By the Mary, Captain\r\nHowland, lately sailed from Havre to New York, I shipped three boxes of\r\nbooks, one marked J. M. for yourself, one marked B. F. for Dr.\r\nFranklin, and one marked W. H. for William Hay in Richmond. I have\r\ntaken the liberty of addressing them all to you, as you will see by the\r\nenclosed bill of lading, in hopes you would be so good as to forward\r\nthe other two. You will have opportunities of calling on the gentlemen\r\nfor the freight, etc. In yours you will find the books noted in the\r\naccount, inclosed herewith. You have now Mabby's works complete, except\r\nthat on Poland, which I have never been able to get, but shall not\r\ncease to search for. Some other volumes are wanting, too, to complete\r\nyour collection of Chronologies. The fourth volume of D'Albon was lost\r\nby the bookbinder, and I have not yet been able to get one to replace\r\nit. I shall continue to try. The Memoires sur les droits et impositions\r\nen Europe, (cited by Smith,) was a scarce and excessively dear book.\r\nThey are now reprinting it. I think it will be in three or four\r\nquartos, of from nine to twelve livres a volume. When it is finished, I\r\nshall take a copy for you. Amelot's travels into China, I can learn\r\nnothing of. I put among the books sent you two somewhat voluminous, and\r\nthe object of which will need explanation; these are the Tableau de\r\nParis and L'espion Anglois. The former is truly a picture of private\r\nmanners in Paris, but presented on the dark side, and a little darkened\r\nmoreover. But there is so much truth in its groundwork, that it will be\r\nwell worth your reading. You will then know Paris (and probably the\r\nother large cities of Europe) as well as if you had been there for\r\nyears. L'espion Anglois is no caricature. It will give you a just idea\r\nof the wheels by which the machine of government is worked here. There\r\nare in it also many interesting details of the last war, which, in\r\ngeneral, may be relied on. It may be considered as the small history of\r\ngreat events. I am in hopes, when you shall have read them, you will\r\nnot think I have misspent your money for them. My method for making out\r\nthis assortment was, to revise the list of my own purchases since the\r\ninvoice of 1785, and to select such as I had found worth your having.\r\nBesides this, I have casually met with and purchased some few curious\r\nand cheap things.\r\n\r\nI must trouble you on behalf of a Mr. Thomas Burke, at Loughburke, near\r\nLoughrea, in Ireland, whose brother, James Burke, is supposed to have\r\ndied in 1785, on his passage from Jamaica, or St. Eustatius to New\r\nYork. His property on board the vessel is understood to have come to\r\nthe hands of alderman Groom at New York. The enclosed copy of a letter\r\nto him, will more fully explain it. A particular friend of mine here\r\napplies to me for information, which I must ask the favor of you to\r\nprocure, and forward to me.\r\n\r\nWriting news to others, much pressed in time, and making this letter\r\none of private business, I did not intend to have said anything to you\r\non political subjects. But I must press one subject. Mr. Adams informs\r\nme he has borrowed money in Holland, which, if confirmed by Congress,\r\nwill enable them to pay, not only the interest due here to the foreign\r\nofficers, but the principal. Let me beseech you to reflect on the\r\nexpediency of transferring this debt to Holland. All our other debts in\r\nEurope do not injure our reputation so much as this. These gentlemen\r\nhave connections both in and out of office, and these again their\r\nconnections, so that our default on this article is further known, more\r\nblamed, and excites worst dispositions against us, than you can\r\nconceive. If you think as I do, pray try to procure an order for paying\r\noff their capital. Mr. Adams adds, that if any certain tax is provided\r\nfor the payment of interest, Congress may borrow enough in Holland to\r\npay off their whole debts in France, both public and private, to the\r\ncrown, to the Farmers, and to Beaumarchais. Surely it will be better to\r\ntransfer these debts to Holland. So critical is the state of that\r\ncountry, that I imagine the moneyed men of it would be glad to place\r\ntheir money in foreign countries, and that Mr. Adams could borrow there\r\nfor us, without a certain tax for the interest, and saving our faith\r\ntoo, by previous explanations on that subject. This country is really\r\nsupposed on the eve of a * * * *. Such a spirit has risen within a few\r\nweeks, as could not have been believed. They see the great deficit in\r\ntheir revenues, and the hopes of economy lessen daily. The parliament\r\nrefuse to register any act for a new tax, and require an Assembly of\r\nthe States. The object of this Assembly is evidently to give law to the\r\nKing, to fix a constitution, to limit expenses. These views are said to\r\ngain upon the nation.[4]\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n      [4] The parts of this letter marked by asterisks, are in cypher\r\n      and unintelligible.\r\n\r\nA final decision of some sort should be made on Beaumarchais' affairs.\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem, dear Sir, your friend\r\nand servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS BARCLAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 3, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors\r\nof June the 29th, and July the 6th and 8th.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that the affair of Geraud and Roland in Holland had\r\nbetter be committed to Mr. Dumas in Holland, as lawsuits must be always\r\nattended to by some person on the spot. For the same reason, I think\r\nthat of La Vayse and Puchilberg should be managed by the agent at\r\nL'Orient, and Gruel's by the agent at Nantes. I shall always be ready\r\nto assist the agents of L'Orient and Nantes in any way in my power; but\r\nwere the details to be left to me, they would languish necessarily, on\r\naccount of my distance from the place, and perhaps suffer too, for want\r\nof verbal consultations with the lawyers entrusted with them. You are\r\nnow with Congress, and can take their orders on the subject. I shall,\r\ntherefore, do nothing in these matters, in reliance that you will put\r\nthem into such channel as they direct, furnishing the necessary\r\ndocuments and explanations.\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nWith respect to the French affair, being perfectly satisfied myself, I\r\nhave not ceased, nor shall I cease, endeavoring to satisfy others, that\r\nyour conduct has been that of an honest and honorable debtor, and\r\ntheirs the counterpart of Shylock in the play. I enclose you a letter\r\ncontaining my testimony on your general conduct, which I have written\r\nto relieve a debt of justice pressing on my mind, well knowing, at the\r\nsame time, you will not stand in need of it in America. Your conduct is\r\ntoo well known to Congress, your character to all the world, to need\r\nany testimonials.\r\n\r\nThe moment I close my despatches for the packet, which will be the 9th\r\ninstant, I shall, with great pleasure, go to pay my respects to Mrs.\r\nBarclay at St. Germains, to satisfy her on the subject of your\r\ntransactions, and to assure her that my resources shall be hers, as\r\nlong as I have any. A multitude of letters to write, prevents my\r\nentering into the field of public news, further than to observe, that\r\nit is extremely doubtful whether the affairs of Holland will, or will\r\nnot produce a war between France, on one side, and England and Prussia,\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nI beg you to accept assurances of the sincere esteem and respect with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARCLAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 3, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As you have acted since my arrival in France, in the\r\ncharacters of Consul-General for that country, and Minister to the\r\nCourt of Morocco, and also as agent in some particular transactions for\r\nthe State of Virginia, I think it is a duty to yourself, to truth, and\r\nto justice, on your departure for America, to declare that, in all\r\nthese characters, as far as has come within my notice, you have acted\r\nwith judgment, with attention, with integrity and honor. I beg you to\r\naccept this feeble tribute to truth, and assurances of sincere\r\nattachment and friendship from, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY EDWARD RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 3, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A journey into the southern parts of France, and northern of\r\nItaly, has prevented my sooner acknowledging the receipt of your\r\nprivate favors of July 12th, 1786, and January 28 and May 3, 1787. I am\r\nanxious to hear what you have done in your federal convention. I am in\r\nhopes at least you will persuade the States to commit their commercial\r\narrangements to Congress, and to enable them to pay their debts,\r\ninterest and capital. The coercive powers supposed to be wanting in the\r\nfederal head, I am of opinion they possess by the law of nature, which\r\nauthorizes one party to an agreement to compel the other to\r\nperformance. A delinquent State makes itself a party against the rest\r\nof the confederacy.\r\n\r\nWe have at present two fires kindled in Europe; 1, in Brabant. The\r\nEmperor, the moment of his return to Vienna, disavowed the concessions\r\nwhich had been made by his governors to quiet the Brabantines. They\r\nprepared, therefore, for regular resistance. But as the Emperor had, at\r\nthe same time, called for deputies to be sent to Vienna to consult on\r\ntheir affairs, they have sent them, but without power to conclude\r\nanything, and in the meantime they go on arming. The enterprising,\r\nunpersevering, capricious, Thrasonic character of their Sovereign\r\nrenders it probable he will avail himself of this little condescendence\r\nin the Brabantines to recede from all his innovations. 2. The Dutch are\r\nevery now and then cutting one another's throats. The party of the\r\nStadtholder is strongest within the confederacy, and is gaining ground.\r\nHe has a majority in the States General, and a strong party in the\r\nStates of Holland. His want of money is supplied by his cousin George.\r\nEngland and Prussia abet his usurpations, and France the patriotic\r\nparty. Were England and France in a condition to go to war, there is no\r\nquestion but they would have been at it before now. But their\r\ninsuperable poverty renders it probable they will compel a suspension\r\nof hostilities, and either arrange and force a settlement on the Dutch,\r\nor if they cannot agree themselves on this, they will try to protract\r\nthings by negotiation. Can I be useful to you here in anything in the\r\npurchase of books, of wines, of fruits, of modes for Mrs. Randolph, or\r\nanything else? As to books, they are cheaper here than in England,\r\nexcepting those in Latin, Greek, or English. As to wines, I have the\r\nbest Vignerons of Bordeaux, Burgundy and Frontinan. Genuine wines can\r\nnever be had but of the Vigneron. The best of Bordeaux cost three\r\nlivres the bottle, but good may be bought for two. Command me freely,\r\nassured that I shall serve you cheerfully, and that I am with respects\r\nto Mrs. Randolph and attachment to yourself, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 3, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's letters of\r\nJanuary 28th, and May 4th, which have come to hand since the date of\r\nmine of February 7th. Immediately on the receipt of the former I caused\r\nenquiry to be made relative to the bayonets, and found that they had\r\ncertainly been packed with the muskets. Your Excellency's favor of May\r\n4th renders unnecessary the sending the proofs. There have been shipped\r\nin the whole from Bordeaux 3,400 stand of arms, and from Havre 3,406\r\ncartouch boxes, which I hope have come safely to hand. Besides these\r\nthere has been a shipment from Bordeaux of powder, etc., made by Mr.\r\nBarclay. This was but the half of what was intended, and of what Mr.\r\nBarclay had contracted for. But his bill on Mr. Grand was protested on\r\na misconception of Mr. Grand's, who, by a mixture of your account with\r\nthat of the United States, had supposed he had but about 12,000 livres\r\nof your money in his hands. I was absent on a journey, and happened in\r\nthe course of that to meet with Mr. Barclay at Bordeaux, and we\r\nconcluded to send you half the quantity. Since my return, I have not\r\nbeen able to have your account exactly settled so as to render it now;\r\nbut am able to say in general and with certainty, that everything sent\r\nyou has been paid, and that after paying Houdon 3,000 livres for the\r\nsecond bust of the Marquis de La Fayette now nearly ready to be sent\r\noff for you, and 10,000 livres the second payment due towards General\r\nWashington's statue, there will remain enough in Mr. Grand's hands to\r\npay for a quantity of powder, &c, equal to that sent you by Mr. Barclay\r\nfrom Bordeaux, which shall accordingly be done. This balance on hand\r\nincludes 5,300 livres paid by Mr. Littlepage, which, though he has sent\r\nus a bill for, six or eight months ago, we had refused to receive till\r\nthe arrival of your Excellency's letter informing me it had not been\r\npaid in America; it was therefore applied for and received by Mr. Grand\r\na few days ago. Mr. Barclay drew on me for the balance of his account\r\nwith the State of Virginia, 2,370 livres, which I paid; besides these\r\nhe afterwards discovered an omission of 108_l._ 8_s._ in his account,\r\nwhich I pay also, so as to leave your account with him balanced. There\r\nis, however, the articles of expenses for young Mercier, which he has\r\nneither entered in your account, nor charged to me in my private\r\naccount. It yet remains due to him, therefore, and I shall pay it to\r\nhim if he applies to me. I should have called for it, but that he was\r\ngone to America before I discovered the omission. Should the State have\r\nfurther occasion for arms, your Excellency will be able to judge,\r\ncombining quality and price, whether those of Liege or of France are to\r\nbe preferred. I shall with cheerfulness obey your future orders on this\r\nor any other account, and have the honor to be, with sentiments of the\r\nmost perfect esteem and respect, your Excellency's most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S.--The original of the report on the inauguration of the bust of\r\nthe Marquis de La Fayette accompanies this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM HAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of April\r\n26, and May 3. I have forwarded, by a vessel lately sailed from Havre\r\nto New York, a box marked W. H., containing the livraisons of the\r\nEncyclopedie subsequent to those Dr. Currie has delivered you, to the\r\n22d inclusive. They are sent to the care of Mr. Madison at Congress,\r\nwho will forward the box to you. There is in it, also, the same\r\nlivraisons to Colonel Monroe. I will continue to forward them once or\r\ntwice a year, as they come out. I have stated in a letter to Dr. Currie\r\nthe cost and expenses of the first twenty-two livraisons, to enable\r\nyourself and himself to settle. The future shall be charged to you or\r\nhim, as your agreement shall be. It is really a most valuable work, and\r\nalmost supplies the place of a library.\r\n\r\nI receive from too many quarters the account of the distresses of my\r\ncountrymen to doubt their truth--distresses brought on themselves by a\r\nfeebleness of mind which calculates very illy its own happiness. It is\r\na miserable arithmetic which makes any single privation whatever so\r\npainful as a total privation of everything which must necessarily\r\nfollow the living so far beyond our income. What is to extricate us I\r\nknow not, whether law, or loss of credit. If the sources of the former\r\nare corrupted, so as to prevent justice the latter must supply its\r\nplace, leave us possessed of our infamous gains, but prevent all future\r\nones of the same character.\r\n\r\nEurope is in a moment of crisis. The innovations by their sovereign in\r\nthe Austrian Netherlands have produced in the people a determination to\r\nresist. The Emperor, by disavowing the concessions made by his\r\ngovernors to quiet the people, seemed to take up the gauntlet which\r\nthey had thrown. Yet it is rather probable he will recede, and all be\r\nhushed up there. The Dutch parties are in a course of hostilities which\r\nit will be difficult to suspend. A war would have been begun before\r\nthis, between this country on one side, and England and Prussia on the\r\nother, had the parties been in a condition for war. Perhaps England\r\nmight have raised supplies, but it would be on a certainty of being\r\ncrushed under them. This country would find greater difficulty. There\r\nis, however, a difference in her favor which might reduce her on a\r\nlevel with England: that is, that it would be a popular war here, and\r\nan unpopular one in England. Probably the weakness of the two countries\r\nwill induce them to join in compelling a suspension of hostilities, and\r\nto make an arrangement for them, or if they cannot agree in that, they\r\nwill spin the matter into length by negotiation. In fact, though both\r\nparties are arming, I do not expect any speedy commencement of\r\nhostilities. I am, with very great respect and esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. DAVID RAMSAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of November\r\n8 and April 7, and the pleasure to inform you that the translation of\r\nyour book sells well, and is universally approved. Froulle will send\r\nyou some copies of it, by the first opportunity. I am happy to hear you\r\nare occupied on the general history. It is a subject worthy your pen. I\r\nobserve Stockdale in London has printed your work and advertised it for\r\nsale. Since I wrote to you on the subject of rice, I have had an\r\nopportunity of examining the rice-fields of Lombardy, and having\r\ncommitted my observations to writing, in a letter to Mr. Drayton, as\r\nPresident of the Agricultural Society, I will take the liberty of\r\nreferring you to that letter, in which probably there is little new to\r\nyour countrymen, though all was new to me. However, if there be a\r\nlittle new and useful, it will be my reward. I have been pressing on\r\nthe merchants here the expediency of enticing the rice-trade to\r\nBordeaux and Honfleur. At length, I have received the enclosed\r\npropositions. They are a firm and very solid house. I wish they may\r\nproduce the effect desired. I have enclosed a copy to Mr. Izard, but\r\nforgot to mention to him, on the subject of white plains and hoes\r\n(particularly named in his letter to me), that this house will begin by\r\nfurnishing them from England, which they think they can do as cheap as\r\nyou can receive them directly from England. The allowance made to\r\nwholesale purchasers will countervail the double voyage. They hope that\r\nafter a while they can have them imitated here. Will you be so good as\r\nto mention this to Mr. Izard? I fear that my zeal will make me expose\r\nmyself to ridicule in this business, for I am no merchant, and still\r\nless knowing in the culture of rice. But this risk becomes a duty by\r\nthe bare possibility of doing good. You mention in your letter, your\r\ninstalment law as needing apology. I have never heard the payment by\r\ninstalment complained of in Europe. On the contrary, in the conferences\r\nMr. Adams and myself had with merchants in London, they admitted the\r\nnecessity of them. It is only necessary that the terms be faithfully\r\nobserved, and the payments be in real money. I am sensible that there\r\nare defects in our federal government, yet they are so much lighter\r\nthan those of monarchies, that I view them with much indulgence. I\r\nrely, too, on the good sense of the people for remedy, whereas the\r\nevils of monarchical government are beyond remedy. If any of our\r\ncountrymen wish for a King, give them AEsop's fable of the frogs who\r\nasked a King; if this does not cure them, send them to Europe. They\r\nwill go back good republicans. Whether we shall have war or not, is\r\nstill doubtful. I conclude we shall not, from, the inability of both\r\nFrance and England to undertake a war. But our friend George is rather\r\nremarkable for doing exactly what he ought not to do. He may,\r\ntherefore, force on a war in favor of his cousin of Holland. I am, with\r\nvery great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD CARRINGTON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since mine of the 16th of January, I have been honored by\r\nyour favors of April the 24th and June the 9th. I am happy to find that\r\nthe States have come so generally into the schemes of the federal\r\nconvention, from which, I am sure, we shall see wise propositions. I\r\nconfess, I do not go as far in the reforms thought necessary, as some\r\nof my correspondents in America; but if the convention should adopt\r\nsuch propositions, I shall suppose them necessary. My general plan\r\nwould be, to make the States one as to everything connected with\r\nforeign nations, and several as to everything purely domestic. But with\r\nall the imperfections of our present government, it is without\r\ncomparison the best existing, or that ever did exist. Its greatest\r\ndefect is the imperfect manner in which matters of commerce have been\r\nprovided for. It has been so often said, as to be generally believed,\r\nthat Congress have no power by the Confederation to enforce anything;\r\nfor example, contributions of money. It was not necessary to give them\r\nthat power expressly; they have it by the law of nature. When two\r\nparties make a compact, there results to each a power of compelling the\r\nother to execute it. Compulsion was never so easy as in our case, where\r\na single frigate would soon levy on the commerce of any State the\r\ndeficiency of its contributions; nor more safe than in the hands of\r\nCongress, which has always shown that it would wait, as it ought to do,\r\nto the last extremities, before it would execute any of its powers\r\nwhich are disagreeable. I think it very material, to separate, in the\r\nhands of Congress, the executive and legislative powers, as the\r\njudiciary already are, in some degree. This, I hope, will be done. The\r\nwant of it has been the source of more evil than we have experienced\r\nfrom any other cause. Nothing is so embarrassing nor so mischievous, in\r\na great assembly, as the details of execution. The smallest trifle of\r\nthat kind occupies as long as the most important act of legislation,\r\nand takes place of everything else. Let any man recollect, or look\r\nover, the files of Congress; he will observe the most important\r\npropositions hanging over, from week to week, and month to month, till\r\nthe occasions have passed them, and the things never done. I have ever\r\nviewed the executive details as the greatest cause of evil to us,\r\nbecause they in fact place us as if we had no federal head, by\r\ndiverting the attention of that head from great to small subjects; and\r\nshould this division of power not be recommended by the convention, it\r\nis my opinion Congress should make itself, by establishing an executive\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. JAMES CURRIE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am favored with your letter of May the 2d, and most\r\ncordially sympathise in your late immediate losses. It is a situation\r\nin which a man needs the aid of all his wisdom and philosophy. But as\r\nit is better to turn from the contemplation of our misfortunes to the\r\nresources we possess of extricating ourselves, you will, of course,\r\nhave found solace in your vigor of mind, health of body, talents,\r\nhabits of business, in the consideration that you have time yet to\r\nretrieve everything, and a knowledge that the very activity necessary\r\nfor this, is a state of greater happiness than the unoccupied one, to\r\nwhich you had a thought of retiring. I wish the bulk of my extravagant\r\ncountrymen had as good prospects and resources as you. But with many of\r\nthem, a feebleness of mind makes them afraid to probe the true state of\r\ntheir affairs, and procrastinate the reformation which alone can save\r\nsomething, to those who may yet be saved. How happy a people were we\r\nduring the war, from the single circumstance that we could not run in\r\ndebt! This counteracted all the inconveniences we felt, as the present\r\nfacility of ruining ourselves overweighs all the blessings of peace. I\r\nknow no condition happier than that of a Virginia farmer might be,\r\nconducting himself as he did during the war. His estate supplies a good\r\ntable, clothes himself and his family with their ordinary apparel,\r\nfurnishes a small surplus to buy salt, sugar, coffee, and a little\r\nfinery for his wife and daughters, enables him to receive and to visit\r\nhis friends, and furnishes him pleasing and healthy occupation. To\r\nsecure all this, he needs but one act of self-denial, to put off buying\r\nanything till he has the money to pay for it. Mr. Ammonett did not\r\ncome. He wrote to me, however, and I am making inquiry for the town and\r\nfamily he indicated. As yet, neither can be heard of, and were they to\r\nbe found, the length of time would probably bar all claims against\r\nthem. I have seen no object present so many desperate faces. However,\r\nif inquiry can lighten our way, that shall not be wanting, and I will\r\nwrite to him as soon as we discover anything, or despair of\r\ndiscovering. Littlepage has succeeded well in Poland. He has some\r\noffice, it is said, worth five hundred guineas a year. The box of seeds\r\nyou were so kind as to forward me came safe to hand. The arrival of my\r\ndaughter, in good health, has been a source of immense comfort to me.\r\nThe injury of which you had heard, was a dislocated wrist, and though\r\nit happened eleven months ago, was a simple dislocation, and\r\nimmediately aided by the best surgeon in Paris, it is neither well, nor\r\never will be, so as to render me much service. The fingers remain\r\nswelled and crooked, the hand withered, and the joint having a very\r\nconfined motion. You ask me when I shall return? My commission expires\r\nnext spring, and if not renewed, I shall return then. If renewed, I\r\nshall stay somewhat longer; how much, will not depend on me altogether.\r\nSo far as it does, I cannot fix the epoch of my return, though I always\r\nflatter myself it is not very distant. My habits are formed to those of\r\nmy own country. I am past the time of changing them, and am, therefore,\r\nless happy anywhere else than there.\r\n\r\nI shall always be happy to hear from you, being with very sincere\r\nesteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BENJAMIN HAWKINS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of March\r\nthe 8th and June the 9th, and to give you many thanks for the trouble\r\nyou have taken with the dionasa muscipula. I have not yet heard\r\nanything of them, which makes me fear they have perished by the way. I\r\nbelieve the most effectual means of conveying them hither, will be by\r\nthe seed. I must add my thanks, too, for the vocabularies. This is an\r\nobject I mean to pursue, as I am persuaded that the only method of\r\ninvestigating the filiation of the Indian nations is by that of their\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nI look up with you to the federal convention for an amendment of our\r\nfederal affairs. Yet I do not view them in so disadvantageous a light\r\nat present, as some do. And above all things, I am astonished at some\r\npeople's considering a kingly government as a refuge. Advise such to\r\nread the fable of the frogs who solicited Jupiter for a king. If that\r\ndoes not put them to rights, send them to Europe, to see something of\r\nthe trappings of monarchy, and I will undertake that every man shall go\r\nback thoroughly cured. If all the evils which can arise among us, from\r\nthe republican form of government, from this day to the day of\r\njudgment, could be put into a scale against what this country suffers\r\nfrom its monarchical form in a week, or England in a month, the latter\r\nwould preponderate. Consider the contents of the Red book in England,\r\nor the Almanac royale of France, and say what a people gain by\r\nmonarchy. No race of kings has ever presented above one man of common\r\nsense in twenty generations. The best they can do is, to leave things\r\nto their ministers; and what are their ministers, but a committee,\r\nbadly chosen? If the king ever meddles, it is to do harm. Adieu, my\r\ndear Sir, and be assured of the esteem of your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 5, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A journey of between three and four months, into the\r\nsouthern parts of France and northern of Italy, has prevented my\r\nwriting to you. In the meantime, you have changed your ground, and\r\nengaged in different occupations, so that I know not whether the news\r\nof this side the water will even amuse you. However, it is all I have\r\nfor you. The storm which seemed to be raised suddenly in Brabant, will\r\nprobably blow over. The Emperor, on his return to Vienna, pretended to\r\nrevoke all the concessions which had been made by his Governors\r\nGeneral, to his Brabantine subjects; but he, at the same time, called\r\nfor deputies from among them to consult with. He will use their agency\r\nto draw himself out of the scrape, and all there, I think, will be\r\nquieted. Hostilities go on occasionally in Holland. France espouses the\r\ncause of the Patriots, as you know, and England and Prussia that of the\r\nStadtholder. France and England are both unwilling to bring on war, but\r\na hasty move of the King of Prussia will perplex them. He has thought\r\nthe stopping his sister sufficient cause for sacrificing a hundred or\r\ntwo thousand of his subjects, and as many Hollanders and French. He has\r\ntherefore ordered twenty thousand men to march, without consulting\r\nEngland, or even his own ministers. He may thus drag England into a\r\nwar, and of course this country, against their will. But it is certain\r\nthey will do everything they can to prevent it; and that in this at\r\nleast they agree. Though such a war might be gainful to us, yet it is\r\nmuch to be deprecated by us at this time. In all probability, France\r\nwould be unequal to such a war by sea and by land, and it is not our\r\ninterest, or even safe for us, that she should be weakened. The great\r\nimprovements in their constitution, effected by the Assemblee des\r\nNotables, you are apprized of. That of partitioning the country into a\r\nnumber of subordinate governments, under the administration of\r\nProvincial Assemblies, chosen by the people, is a capital one. But to\r\nthe delirium of joy which these improvements gave the nation, a strange\r\nreverse of temper has suddenly succeeded. The deficiencies of their\r\nrevenue were exposed, and they were frightful. Yet there was an\r\nappearance of intention to economise, and reduce the expenses of\r\ngovernment. But expenses are still very inconsiderately incurred, and\r\nall reformation in that point despaired of. The public credit is\r\naffected; and such a spirit of discontent has arisen, as has never been\r\nseen. The parliament refused to register the edict for a stamp tax, or\r\nany other tax, and call for the States General, who alone, they say,\r\ncan impose a new tax, They speak with a boldness unexampled. The King\r\nhas called them to Versailles to-morrow, where he will hold a _lit de\r\njustice_, and compel them to register the tax. How the chapter will\r\nfinish, we must wait to see. By a vessel lately sailed from Havre to\r\nNew York, I have sent you some more livraisons of the Encyclopedie,\r\ndown to the 22d inclusive. They were in a box with Dr. Currie's, and\r\naddressed to Mr. Madison, who will forward them to Richmond. I have\r\nheard you are in the Assembly. I will beg the favor of you, therefore,\r\nto give me, at the close of the session, a history of the most\r\nremarkable acts passed, the parties and views of the House, etc. This,\r\nwith the small news of my country, crops and prices, will furnish you\r\nabundant matter to treat me, while I have nothing to give you in\r\nreturn, but the histories of the follies of nations in their dotage.\r\nPresent me in respectful and friendly terms to Mrs. Monroe, and be\r\nassured of the sincere sentiments of esteem and attachment with which I\r\nam, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 5, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--In my last of June 17, 1787, I had the honor of\r\ncommunicating to you the information I had received from Mr. Grand,\r\nthat your funds here were out, and he considerably in advance. I took\r\noccasion to mention to him the paragraph in your letter of February 17,\r\nwherein you were so kind as to say your attention should be immediately\r\nturned to the making a remittance. However, I understood soon after\r\nthat he had protested a draught of Mr. Carmichael's, as also a smaller\r\none of five hundred livres. He called upon me, and explaining to me the\r\nextent of his advances, observed that he should not be willing to add\r\nto them, except so far as should be necessary for the private expenses\r\nof myself and secretary, which he wished to be reduced as much below\r\nthe ordinary allowance as we could, until remittances should be\r\nreceived. He will send you by this packet a state of his accounts, by\r\nwhich he informs me that your account is in arrear about thirty-two\r\nthousand livres, advanced by him, and about fifteen thousand livres\r\nfrom a fund of the State of Virginia, placed here for the purchase of\r\narms, making General Washington's statue, etc. In examining his\r\naccounts, I found by the one he had sent you formerly, that you were\r\ndebited two articles of ten thousand livres and two thousand seven\r\nhundred and twenty-four livres and sixty-six sous, which belonged to\r\nthe account of the State of Virginia. This I must explain to you. That\r\nState had directed me to have the statue of General Washington made,\r\nand given me assurances such as I could rely on, that I should receive\r\nfunds immediately. Doctor Franklin was setting out to America, and\r\nHoudon, the statuary, expressed a willingness to go with him. But it\r\nwas necessary to advance him a sum of money for that purpose. Rather\r\nthan lose the opportunity, I ventured to borrow from the fund of the\r\nUnited States those two sums for the State of Virginia, which I knew\r\nwould be immediately replaced. The funds of the State arrived, (being\r\nnearly two hundred thousand livres,) and enabled me not only to replace\r\nthose sums immediately, but to furnish much larger supplies to the\r\nwants of the United States, when their funds failed. Insomuch that the\r\nState of Virginia is now in advance here for the United States about\r\nfifteen thousand livres, as before mentioned. As yet it has not\r\nsuffered by any of these advances, but having no money left here but\r\nthis balance, I shall be censurable by that State if it be not replaced\r\nin time to answer the demands on them, which will now be made within a\r\nfew weeks. Mr. Grand has, by my direction, credited you in the account\r\nhe now sends for the two sums of ten thousand livres and two thousand,\r\nseven hundred and twenty-four livres and sixty-six sous, improperly\r\ncharged in your former account. He had also debited you in his account\r\nfor the whole sums paid by the United States, as well as those paid by\r\nVirginia, as by himself. The purpose of this was to keep the accounts\r\nunmixed, though in fact the funds have been applied occasionally in aid\r\nof each other.\r\n\r\nI had proposed to Mr. Barclay the settlement of my account before his\r\ndeparture for Morocco, but we concluded it would be better to do it on\r\nhis return, as that would enable me to bring it down to a later day. It\r\nwas not then expected he would be so long detained by that business.\r\nUnfortunately for me, when at L'Orient, on his return to Paris, he\r\nfound it more advisable to proceed directly to America, so that I have\r\nlost this opportunity of having my account settled. I shall either do\r\nit with him on his return, if he returns soon, or with such other\r\nperson here as you will point out, or I will transmit it with copies of\r\nmy vouchers, to be settled by you, or do whatever else with it you\r\nshall please to direct. The articles which, from their minuteness, have\r\nnot admitted the taking vouchers, I shall be ready to prove by my own\r\noath. In this account I have presumed to charge the United States with\r\nan outfit. The necessity of this in the case of a minister, resident,\r\nand of course obliged to establish a house, is obvious on reflection.\r\nThere cannot be a surer proof of its necessity than the experience and\r\nconsent of all nations, as I believe there is no instance of any nation\r\nsending a minister to reside anywhere without an outfit. A year's\r\nsalary is the least I have been able to hear of, and I should be able\r\nto show that the articles of clothes, carriage and horses, and\r\nhousehold furniture, in a very plain style, have cost me more than\r\nthat. When I send you my account, either settled here, or to be settled\r\nthere, I shall take the liberty of referring this article to the\r\nconsideration of Congress. Its reasonableness has appeared to me so\r\npalpable, that I have presumed it would appear so to Congress, and have\r\ntherefore kept up the expenses of my house at the current rate of nine\r\nthousand dollars a year. If my expectations should be thought\r\nunreasonable, I shall submit and immediately reduce my establishment,\r\nwith such rigor, as to make up this article in the shortest time\r\npossible. I enclose you a letter from Fisseaux & Co. on the subject of\r\ntheir loan. I wish the loan lately obtained by Mr. Adams, may enable\r\nyou to get rid of the debt of the Foreign Officers, principal and\r\ninterest. Indeed, if Mr. Adams could be charged with the transfer of\r\nour whole debt from this country to Holland, it would be a most\r\nsalutary operation. The confusions of that country might perhaps\r\nfacilitate that measure at present, though no regular tax could be\r\nobtained in the moment for payment of the interest. I have the honor to\r\nbe, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, gentlemen,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 6, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--The last letter I had the honor of addressing you, was dated June\r\nthe 21st. I have now that of enclosing you a letter from the Swedish\r\nAmbassador, praying that inquiry may be made for a vessel of his\r\nnation, piratically carried off, and measures taken relative to the\r\nvessel, cargo and crew. Also a letter from William Russell and others,\r\ncitizens of America, concerned in trade to the island of Guadeloupe,\r\naddressed to the Marechal de Castries, and complaining of the shutting\r\nto them the port of Point a Pitre, and receiving them only at\r\nBessa-tern. This was enclosed to me by the subscribers, to be delivered\r\nto the Marechal de Castries. But the present is not the moment to move\r\nin that business; and moreover, I suppose, that whenever parties are\r\nwithin the reach of Congress, they should apply to them, and my\r\ninstructions come through that channel. Matters arising within the\r\nkingdom of France, to which my commission is limited, and not admitting\r\ntime to take the orders of Congress, I suppose I may move in\r\noriginally. I also enclose you the copy of a letter from Mr. Barclay,\r\nclosing his proceedings in our affairs with Morocco. Before this\r\nreaches you, he will have had the honor of presenting himself to you in\r\nperson. After his departure, the parliament of Bordeaux decided that he\r\nwas liable to arrest. This was done on a letter from the Minister,\r\ninforming them that Mr. Barclay was invested with no character which\r\nprivileged him from arrest. His constant character of consul was no\r\nprotection, and they did not explain whether his character to Morocco\r\nwas not originally diplomatic, or was expired. Mr. Barclay's\r\nproceedings under this commission being now closed, it would be\r\nincumbent on me to declare with respect to them, as well as his\r\nconsular transactions, my opinion of the judgment, zeal and\r\ndisinterestedness with which he has conducted himself; were it not that\r\nCongress has been so possessed of those transactions from time to time,\r\nas to judge for themselves. I cannot but be uneasy, lest my delay of\r\nentering on the subject of the consular convention, may be disapproved.\r\nMy hope was and is, that more practicable terms might be obtained; in\r\nthis hope, I do nothing till further orders, observing by an extract\r\nfrom the journals you were pleased to send me, that Congress have\r\nreferred the matter to your consideration, and conscious that we are\r\nnot suffering in the meantime, as we have not a single consul in\r\nFrance, since the departure of Mr. Barclay. I mentioned to you in my\r\nlast, the revival of the hopes of the Chevalier de La Luzerne. I\r\nthought it my duty to remind the Count de Montmorin, the other day, of\r\nthe long absence of their Minister from Congress. He told me, the\r\nChevalier de La Luzerne would not be sent back, but that we might rely\r\nthat, in the month of October, a person would be sent, with whom we\r\nshould be content. He did not name the person, though there is no doubt\r\nthat it is the Count de Mourtier. It is an appointment, which,\r\naccording to the opinion I have formed of him, bids as fair to give\r\ncontent, as any one which could be made.\r\n\r\nI also mentioned in my last letter, that I had proposed the reducing\r\nthe substance of Monsieur de Calonnes' letter into the form of an\r\n_Arret_, with some alterations, which, on consultation with the\r\nmerchants at the different ports I visited, I had found to be\r\nnecessary. I received, soon after, a letter from the Comptroller\r\nGeneral, informing me, that the letter of Monsieur de Calonnes was in a\r\ncourse of execution. Of this, I enclose you a copy. I was, in that\r\nmoment, enclosing to him my general observations on that letter, a copy\r\nof which are also enclosed. In these, I stated all the alterations I\r\nwished to have made. It became expedient, soon after, to bring on the\r\narticle of tobacco; first, to know whether the Farmers had executed the\r\norder of Bernis, and also to prepare some arrangements to succeed the\r\nexpiration of this order. So that I am now pursuing the whole subject\r\nof our commerce, 1, to have necessary amendments made in Monsieur de\r\nCalonnes' letter; 2, to put it into a more stable form; 3, to have full\r\nexecution of the order of Bernis; 4, to provide arrangements for the\r\narticle of tobacco, after that order shall be expired. By the copy of\r\nmy letter on the two last points, you will perceive that I again press\r\nthe abolition of the Farm of this article. The conferences on that\r\nsubject give no hope of effecting that. Some poor palliative is\r\nprobably all we shall obtain. The Marquis de La Fayette goes hand in\r\nhand with me in all these transactions, and is an invaluable auxiliary\r\nto me. I hope it will not be imputed either to partiality or\r\naffectation, my naming this gentleman so often in my despatches. Were I\r\nnot to do it, it would be a suppression of truth, and the taking to\r\nmyself the whole merit where he has the greatest share.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, on his return to Vienna, disavowed the concessions of his\r\nGovernors General to his subjects of Brabant. He, at the same time,\r\nproposed their sending deputies to him, to consult on their affairs.\r\nThey refused in the first moment; but afterwards nominated deputies;\r\nwithout giving them any power, however, to concede anything. In the\r\nmeantime, they are arming and training themselves. Probably the Emperor\r\nwill avail himself of the aid of these deputies to tread back his\r\nsteps. He will be the more prompt to do this, that he may be in\r\nreadiness to act freely, if he finds occasion, in the new scenes\r\npreparing in Holland. What these will be cannot be foreseen. You well\r\nknow, that the original party-divisions of that country were, into\r\nStadtholderians, Aristocrats, and Democrats. There was a subdivision of\r\nthe Aristocrats, into violent and moderate, which was important. The\r\nviolent Aristocrats would have wished to preserve all the powers of\r\ngovernment in the hands of the Regents, and that these should remain\r\nself-elective; but choosing to receive a modification of these powers\r\nfrom the Stadtholder, rather than from the people, they threw\r\nthemselves into his scale. The moderate Aristocrats would have\r\nconsented to a temperate mixture of democracy, and particularly, that\r\nthe Regents should be elected by the people. They were the declared\r\nenemies of the Stadtholder, and acted in concert with the Democrats,\r\nforming with them what was called the Patriots. It is the opinion of\r\ndispassionate people on the spot, that their views might have been\r\neffected. But the democratic party aimed at more. They talked of\r\nestablishing tribunes of the people, of annual accounts, of depriving\r\nthe magistrates at the will of the people, etc.; of enforcing all this\r\nwith the arms in the hands of the _corps francs_; and in same places,\r\nas at Heusden, Sprang, etc., began the execution of these projects. The\r\nmoderate Aristocrats found it difficult to strain their principles to\r\nthis pitch. A schism took place between them and the Democrats, and the\r\nformer have for some time, been dropping off from the latter, into the\r\nscale of the Stadtholder. This is the fatal coalition which governs\r\nwithout obstacle in Zealand, Friesland, and Guelderland, which\r\nconstitutes the States of Utrecht, at Amersfort, and, with their aid,\r\nthe plurality in the States General. The States of Holland, Groningen\r\nand Overyssel vote, as yet, in the opposition. But the coalition gains\r\nground in the States of Holland, and has been prevalent in the Council\r\nof Amsterdam. If its progress be not stopped by a little moderation in\r\nthe Democrats, it will turn the scale decidedly in favor of the\r\nStadtholder, in the event of their being left to themselves without\r\nforeign interference. If foreign powers interfere, their prospect does\r\nnot brighten. I see no sure friends to the Patriots but France, while\r\nPrussia and England are their assured enemies. Nor is it probable that\r\ncharacters so greedy, so enterprising, as the Emperor and Empress, will\r\nbe idle during such a struggle. Their views have long shown which side\r\nthey would take. That France has engaged to interfere, and to support\r\nthe Patriots, is beyond doubt. This engagement was entered into during\r\nthe life of the late King of Prussia, whose eye was principally\r\ndirected on the Emperor, and whose dispositions towards the Prince of\r\nOrange would have permitted him to be clipped a little close. But the\r\npresent King comes in with warmer dispositions towards the Princess his\r\nsister. He has shown decidedly, that he will support her, even to the\r\ndestruction of the balance of Europe, and the disturbance of its peace.\r\nThe King of England has equally decided to support that house, at the\r\nrisk of plunging his nation into another war. He supplies the Prince\r\nwith money at this moment. A particular remittance of one hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand guineas is known of. But his ministry is divided. Pitt\r\nis against the King's opinion, the Duke of Richmond and the rest of the\r\nministers, for it. Or at least, such is the belief here. Mr. Adams will\r\nhave informed you more certainly. This division in the English\r\nministry, with the ill condition of their finances for war, produces a\r\ndisposition, even in the King, to try first every pacific measure; and\r\nthat country and this were laboring jointly to stop the course of\r\nhostilities in Holland, to endeavor to effect an accommodation, and\r\nwere scarcely executing at all, the armaments ordered in their ports;\r\nwhen all of a sudden, an inflammatory letter written by the Princess of\r\nOrange to the King of Prussia, induces him, without consulting England,\r\nwithout consulting even his own Council, to issue orders by himself to\r\nhis Generals, to march twenty thousand men, to revenge the insult\r\nsupposed to be offered to his sister. With a pride and egotism planted\r\nin the heart of every King, he considers her being stopped in the road,\r\nas a sufficient cause to sacrifice a hundred or two thousand of his own\r\nsubjects, and as many of his enemies, and to spread fire, sword and\r\ndesolation, over the half of Europe. This hasty measure has embarrassed\r\nEngland, undesirous of war if it can be avoided, yet unwilling to\r\nseparate from the power who is to render its success probable. Still\r\nyou may be assured, that that court is going on in concurrence with\r\nthis, to prevent extremities, if possible; always understood, that if\r\nthe war cannot be prevented, they will enter into it as parties, and in\r\nopposition to one another. This event is, in my opinion, to be\r\ndeprecated by the friends of France. She never was equal to such a war\r\nby land, and such a one by sea; and less so now, than in any moment of\r\nthe present reign. You remember that the nation was in a delirium of\r\njoy on the convocation of the Notables, and on the various reformations\r\nagreed on between them and the government. The picture of the distress\r\nof their finances was indeed frightful, but the intentions to reduce\r\nthem to order seemed serious. The constitutional reformations have gone\r\non well, but those of expenses make little progress. Some of the most\r\nobviously useless have indeed been lopped off, but the remainder is a\r\nheavy mass, difficult to be reduced. Despair has seized every mind, and\r\nthey have passed from an extreme of joy to one of discontent. The\r\nparliament, therefore, oppose the registering any new tax, and insist\r\non an Assembly of the States General. The object of this is to limit\r\nexpenses, and dictate a constitution. The edict for the stamp tax has\r\nbeen the subject of reiterated orders and refusals to register. At\r\nlength, the King has summoned the parliament to Versailles to hold a\r\nbed of justice, in which he will order them, in person, to register the\r\nedict. At the moment of my writing, they are gone to Versailles for\r\nthis purpose. There will yet remain to them, to protest against the\r\nregister, as forced, and to issue orders against its execution on pain\r\nof death. But as the King would have no peaceable mode of opposition\r\nleft, it remains to be seen whether they will push the matter to this\r\nextremity. It is evident, I think, that a spirit of this country is\r\nadvancing towards a revolution in their constitution. There are not\r\nwanting persons at the helm, friends to the progress of this spirit.\r\nThe Provincial Assemblies will be the most probable instrument of\r\neffecting it.\r\n\r\nSince writing thus far, I have received an intimation, that it will be\r\nagreeable, not to press our commercial regulations at this moment, the\r\nministry being too much occupied with the difficulties surrounding\r\nthem, to spare a moment on any subject which will admit of delay. Our\r\nbusiness must, therefore, be suspended for awhile. To press it out of\r\nseason would be to defeat it. It would be felt as a vital benefit here,\r\ncould we relieve their finances, by paying what we owe. Congress will\r\njudge by Mr. Adams' letters, how far the transferring all our debts in\r\nthis country, to Holland, is practicable. On the replenishing their\r\ntreasury with our principal and interest, I should not be afraid to ask\r\nconcessions in favor of our West India trade. It would produce a great\r\nchange of opinion as to us and our affairs. In the Assemblee des\r\nNotables, hard things were said of us. They were induced, however, in\r\ncommitting us to writing, to smother their ideas a little. In the\r\nnotes, now gone to be printed, our debt is described in these words.\r\n\"The twenty-first article of the account, formed of the interest of the\r\nclaims of his majesty on the United States of America, cannot be drawn\r\nout for the present, except as a document. The recovery of these\r\nclaims, as well principal as perhaps even interest, although they\r\nappear to rest on the most solid security, may, nevertheless, be long\r\ndelayed, and should not, consequently, be taken into account in\r\nestimating the annual revenue. This article amounts to one million and\r\nsix hundred thousand livres.\" Above all things, it is desirable to hush\r\nthe foreign officers by payment. Their wants, the nature of their\r\nservices, their access to high characters, and connections with them,\r\nbespeak the reasons for this. I hear also that Mr. Beaumarchais means\r\nto make himself heard, if a memorial which he sends by an agent in the\r\npresent packet is not attended to, as he thinks it ought to be. He\r\ncalled on me with it, and desired me to recommend his case to a\r\ndecision, and to note in my despatch, that it was the first time he had\r\nspoken to me on the subject. This is true, it being the first time I\r\never saw him; but my recommendations would be as displaced as\r\nunnecessary. I assured him, Congress would do in that business, what\r\njustice should require, and their means enable them. The information\r\nsent me by Mr. Montgomery from Alicant, of the death of the Dey of\r\nAlgiers, was not true. I had expressed my doubt of it in my last, when\r\nI communicated it. I send herewith the newspapers to this date, and a\r\nremonstrance of the parliament, to show you in what language the King\r\ncan be addressed at this day. I have received no journal of Congress\r\nsince the beginning of November last, and will thank you for them if\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. August 7. The parliament were received yesterday very harshly by\r\nthe King. He obliged them to register the two edicts for the\r\nimpot-territorial and stamp tax. When speaking in my letter of the\r\nreiterated orders and refusals to register, which passed between the\r\nKing and parliament, I omitted to insert the King's answer to a\r\ndeputation of parliament, which attended him at Versailles. It may\r\nserve to show the spirit which exists between them. It was in these\r\nwords, and these only: \"Je vous ferai savoir mes intentions.\r\nAllez-vous-en. Qu'on ferme la porte.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Aug. 6, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am honored with your letter by your son, and shall be\r\nhappy to render him every assistance in my power of whatever nature.\r\nThe objects of his stay in this country, and of his visit to London,\r\nare perfectly well judged. So of that to Amsterdam. Perhaps it is\r\nquestionable, whether the time you propose he should spend at some of\r\nthe German courts might not be better employed at Madrid or Lisbon, and\r\nin Italy. At the former there could be no object for him but politics,\r\nthe system of which there is intricate, and can never be connected with\r\nus; nor will our commercial connections be considerable. With Madrid\r\nand Lisbon our connections, both political and commercial, are great\r\nand will be increasing daily. Italy is a field where the inhabitants of\r\nthe Southern States may see much to copy in agriculture, and a country\r\nwith which we shall carry on considerable trade. Pardon my submitting\r\nthese thoughts to you. We shall pursue your own plan unless you notify\r\na change in it.\r\n\r\nThe present question in Europe is war or not war? I think there will be\r\nnone between the Emperor and his Brabantine subjects. But as to\r\nHolland, it is more doubtful, for we do not as yet consider the little\r\npartisan affairs which are taking place every day. France and England,\r\nconscious that their exhausted means would poorly feed a war, have been\r\nstrenuously exerting themselves to procure an accommodation. But the\r\nKing of Prussia, in a moment of passion, has taken a measure which may\r\ndefeat their wishes. On receiving from the Princess of Orange, a letter\r\ninforming him of her having been stopped on the road, without\r\nconsulting the court of London, without saying a word to his own\r\nministers, he issued orders himself to his Generals to march twenty\r\nthousand men to be at her orders. England, unwilling to bring on a war,\r\nmay yet fear to separate from him who is to be her main ally. Still,\r\nshe is endeavoring, in concurrence with this court, to stop the effects\r\nof this hasty movement, and to bring about a suspension of hostilities\r\nand settlement of difficulties, always meaning if they fail in this, to\r\ntake the field in opposition to one another. Blessed effect of a kingly\r\ngovernment, where a pretended insult to the sister of a king, is to\r\nproduce the wanton sacrifice of a hundred or two thousand of the people\r\nwho have entrusted themselves to his government, and as many of his\r\nenemies! and we think ours a bad government. The only condition on\r\nearth to be compared with ours, in my opinion, is that of the Indian,\r\nwhere they have still less law than we. The European, are governments\r\nof kites over pigeons. The best schools for republicanism are London,\r\nVersailles, Madrid, Vienna, Berlin, &c. Adieu, my dear Sir, and be\r\nassured of the sincere esteem of your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE CREVE-COEUR.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 6, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I was not a little disappointed to find on my return that\r\nyou had gone punctually in the packet as you had proposed. Great is the\r\nchange in the dispositions of this country in the short time since you\r\nleft it. A continuation of inconsiderate expense seemed to have raised\r\nthe nation to the highest pitch of discontent. The parliament refused\r\nto register the new taxes. After much and warm altercation, a _lit de\r\njustice_ has been held this day at Versailles; it was opened by the\r\nreading a severe remonstrance from the parliament, to which the King\r\nmade a hard reply, and finished by ordering the stamp tax, and\r\nimpot-territorial to be registered. Your nation is advancing to a\r\nchange of constitution; the young desire it, the middle aged are not\r\naverse, the old alone opposed it. They will die, the provincial\r\nassemblies will chalk out the plan, and the nation, ripening fast, will\r\nexecute it. All your friends are in the country, so I can give you no\r\nnews of them; but no news are always good news. The Duchess Danville is\r\nwith some of her friends; the Duke and Duchess de La Rochefoucault gone\r\nto the waters; the Countess d'Houdelot with Madame de La Britu. Your\r\nsons are well, and go on well, and we are laboring here to improve on\r\nM. de Calonne's letter on our commerce. Adieu, my dear Sir, and be\r\nassured of the sentiments of sincere esteem with which I am your friend\r\nand servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL RICHARD CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 8, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am of opinion that American tenants for western lands could not\r\nbe procured, and if they could, they would be very unsure. The best, as\r\nfar as I have been able to judge, are foreigners, who do not speak the\r\nlanguage. Unable to communicate with the people of the country, they\r\nconfine themselves to their farms and their families, compare their\r\npresent state to what it was in Europe, and find great reason to be\r\ncontented. Of all foreigners, I should prefer Germans. They are the\r\neasiest got, the best for their landlords, and do best for themselves.\r\nThe deed in which you were interested, having been sent to me the other\r\nday to be authenticated, I took the enclosed note of its particulars\r\nfor you. I am, with much esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN CHURCHMAN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 8, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of June the 6th, and immediately\r\ncommunicated its contents to a member of the Academy. He told me that\r\nthey had received the other copy of your memorial, which you mention to\r\nhave sent through another channel; that your ideas were not conveyed so\r\nexplicitly, as to enable them to decide finally on their merit, but\r\nthat they had made an entry in their journals, to preserve to you the\r\nclaim of the original idea. As far as we can conjecture it here, we\r\nimagine you make a table of variations of the needle, for all the\r\ndifferent meridians whatever. To apply this table to use, in the voyage\r\nbetween America and Europe, suppose the variation to increase a degree\r\nin every one hundred and sixty miles. Two difficulties occur: 1, a\r\nready and accurate method of finding the variation of the place; 2, an\r\ninstrument so perfect, as that (though the degree on it shall represent\r\none hundred and sixty miles) it shall give the parts of the degree so\r\nminutely, as to answer the purpose of the navigator. The variation of\r\nthe needle at Paris, actually, is 21 deg. west. I make no question you have\r\nprovided against the doubts entertained here, and I shall be happy that\r\nour country may have the honor of furnishing the old world what it has\r\nso long sought in vain. I am, with much respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR L'HOMMANDE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--At the time you honored me with your letter of May the 31st, I\r\nwas not returned from a journey I had taken into Italy. This\r\ncircumstance, with the mass of business which had accumulated during my\r\nabsence, must apologise for the delay of my answer. Every discovery\r\nwhich multiplies the subsistence of man, must be a matter of joy to\r\nevery friend to humanity. As such, I learn with great satisfaction,\r\nthat you have found the means of preserving flour more perfectly than\r\nhas been done hitherto. But I am not authorized to avail my country of\r\nit, by making any offer for its communication. Their policy is, to\r\nleave their citizens free, neither restraining nor aiding them in their\r\npursuits. Though the interposition of government, in matters of\r\ninvention, has its use, yet it is in practice so inseparable from\r\nabuse, that they think it better not to meddle with it. We are only to\r\nhope, therefore, that those governments who are in the habit of\r\ndirecting all the actions of their subjects, by particular law, may be\r\nso far sensible of the duty they are under of cultivating useful\r\ndiscoveries, as to reward you amply for yours, which is among the most\r\ninteresting to humanity. I have the honor to be, with great\r\nconsideration and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PETER CARR.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 10, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR PETER,--I have received your two letters of December the 30th and\r\nApril the 18th, and am very happy to find by them, as well as by\r\nletters from Mr. Wythe, that you have been so fortunate as to attract\r\nhis notice and good will; I am sure you will find this to have been one\r\nof the most fortunate events of your life, as I have ever been sensible\r\nit was of mine. I enclose you a sketch of the sciences to which I would\r\nwish you to apply, in such order as Mr. Wythe shall advise; I mention,\r\nalso, the books in them worth your reading, which submit to his\r\ncorrection. Many of these are among your father's books, which you\r\nshould have brought to you. As I do not recollect those of them not in\r\nhis library, you must write to me for them, making out a catalogue of\r\nsuch as you think you shall have occasion for, in eighteen months from\r\nthe date of your letter, and consulting Mr. Wythe on the subject. To\r\nthis sketch, I will add a few particular observations:\r\n\r\n1. Italian. I fear the learning this language will confound your French\r\nand Spanish. Being all of them degenerated dialects of the Latin, they\r\nare apt to mix in conversation. I have never seen a person speaking the\r\nthree languages, who did not mix them. It is a delightful language, but\r\nlate events having rendered the Spanish more useful, lay it aside to\r\nprosecute that.\r\n\r\n2. Spanish. Bestow great attention on this, and endeavor to acquire an\r\naccurate knowledge of it. Our future connections with Spain and Spanish\r\nAmerica, will render that language a valuable acquisition. The ancient\r\nhistory of that part of America, too, is written in that language. I\r\nsend you a dictionary.\r\n\r\n3. Moral Philosophy. I think it lost time to attend lectures on this\r\nbranch. He who made us would have been a pitiful bungler, if he had\r\nmade the rules of our moral conduct a matter of science. For one man of\r\nscience, there are thousands who are not. What would have become of\r\nthem? Man was destined for society. His morality, therefore, was to be\r\nformed to this object. He was endowed with a sense of right and wrong,\r\nmerely relative to this. This sense is as much a part of his nature, as\r\nthe sense of hearing, seeing, feeling; it is the true foundation of\r\nmorality, and not the [Greek: to kalon], truth, &c., as fanciful\r\nwriters have imagined. The moral sense, or conscience, is as much a\r\npart of man as his leg or arm. It is given to all human beings in a\r\nstronger or weaker degree, as force of members is given them in a\r\ngreater or less degree. It may be strengthened by exercise, as may any\r\nparticular limb of the body. This sense is submitted, indeed, in some\r\ndegree, to the guidance of reason; but it is a small stock which is\r\nrequired for this: even a less one than what we call common sense.\r\nState a moral case to a ploughman and a professor. The former will\r\ndecide it as well, and often better than the latter, because he has not\r\nbeen led astray by artificial rules. In this branch, therefore, read\r\ngood books, because they will encourage, as well as direct your\r\nfeelings. The writings of Sterne, particularly, form the best course of\r\nmorality that ever was written. Besides these, read the books mentioned\r\nin the enclosed paper; and, above all things, lose no occasion of\r\nexercising your dispositions to be grateful, to be generous, to be\r\ncharitable, to be humane, to be true, just, firm, orderly, courageous,\r\n&c. Consider every act of this kind, as an exercise which will\r\nstrengthen your moral faculties and increase your worth.\r\n\r\n4. Religion. Your reason is now mature enough to examine this object.\r\nIn the first place, divest yourself of all bias in favor of novelty and\r\nsingularity of opinion. Indulge them in any other subject rather than\r\nthat of religion. It is too important, and the consequences of error\r\nmay be too serious. On the other hand, shake off all the fears and\r\nservile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix\r\nreason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every\r\nopinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because,\r\nif there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than\r\nthat of blindfolded fear. You will naturally examine first, the\r\nreligion of your own country. Read the Bible, then, as you would read\r\nLivy or Tacitus. The facts which are within the ordinary course of\r\nnature, you will believe on the authority of the writer, as you do\r\nthose of the same kind in Livy and Tacitus. The testimony of the writer\r\nweighs in their favor, in one scale, and their not being against the\r\nlaws of nature, does not weigh against them. But those facts in the\r\nBible which contradict the laws of nature, must be examined with more\r\ncare, and under a variety of faces. Here you must recur to the\r\npretensions of the writer to inspiration from God. Examine upon what\r\nevidence his pretensions are founded, and whether that evidence is so\r\nstrong, as that its falsehood would be more improbable than a change in\r\nthe laws of nature, in the case he relates. For example, in the book of\r\nJoshua, we are told, the sun stood still several hours. Were we to read\r\nthat fact in Livy or Tacitus, we should class it with their showers of\r\nblood, speaking of statues, beasts, etc. But it is said, that the\r\nwriter of that book was inspired. Examine, therefore, candidly, what\r\nevidence there is of his having been inspired. The pretension is\r\nentitled to your inquiry, because millions believe it. On the other\r\nhand, you are astronomer enough to know how contrary it is to the law\r\nof nature that a body revolving on its axis, as the earth does, should\r\nhave stopped, should not, by that sudden stoppage, have prostrated\r\nanimals, trees, buildings, and should after a certain time have resumed\r\nits revolution, and that without a second general prostration. Is this\r\narrest of the earth's motion, or the evidence which affirms it, most\r\nwithin the law of probabilities? You will next read the New Testament.\r\nIt is the history of a personage called Jesus. Keep in your eye the\r\nopposite pretensions: 1, of those who say he was begotten by God, born\r\nof a virgin, suspended and reversed the laws of nature at will, and\r\nascended bodily into heaven; and 2, of those who say he was a man of\r\nillegitimate birth, of a benevolent heart, enthusiastic mind, who set\r\nout without pretensions to divinity, ended in believing them, and was\r\npunished capitally for sedition, by being gibbeted, according to the\r\nRoman law, which punished the first commission of that offence by\r\nwhipping, and the second by exile, or death _in furea_. See this law in\r\nthe Digest, Lib. 48. tit. 19. Sec. 28.3. and Lipsius Lib. 2. de cruce.\r\ncap. 2. These questions are examined in the books I have mentioned,\r\nunder the head of Religion, and several others. They will assist you in\r\nyour inquiries; but keep your reason firmly on the watch in reading\r\nthem all. Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its\r\nconsequences. If it ends in a belief that there is no God, you will\r\nfind incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in\r\nits exercise, and the love of others which it will procure you. If you\r\nfind reason to believe there is a God, a consciousness that you are\r\nacting under his eye, and that he approves you, will be a vast\r\nadditional incitement; if that there be a future state, the hope of a\r\nhappy existence in that increases the appetite to deserve it; if that\r\nJesus was also a God, you will be comforted by a belief of his aid and\r\nlove. In fine, I repeat, you must lay aside all prejudice on both\r\nsides, and neither believe nor reject anything, because any other\r\npersons, or description of persons, have rejected or believed it. Your\r\nown reason is the only oracle given you by heaven, and you are\r\nanswerable, not for the rightness, but uprightness of the decision. I\r\nforgot to observe, when speaking of the New Testament, that you should\r\nread all the histories of Christ, as well of those whom a council of\r\necclesiastics have decided for us, to be Pseudo-evangelists, as those\r\nthey named Evangelists. Because these Pseudo-evangelists pretended to\r\ninspiration, as much as the others, and you are to judge their\r\npretensions by your own reason, and not by the reason of those\r\necclesiastics. Most of these are lost. There are some, however, still\r\nextant, collected by Fabricius, which I will endeavor to get and send\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n5. Travelling. This makes men wiser, but less happy. When men of sober\r\nage travel, they gather knowledge, which they may apply usefully for\r\ntheir country; but they are subject ever after to recollections mixed\r\nwith regret; their affections are weakened by being extended over more\r\nobjects; and they learn new habits which cannot be gratified when they\r\nreturn home. Young men, who travel, are exposed to all these\r\ninconveniences in a higher degree, to others still more serious, and do\r\nnot acquire that wisdom for which a previous foundation is requisite,\r\nby repeated and just observations at home. The glare of pomp and\r\npleasure is analogous to the motion of the blood; it absorbs all their\r\naffection and attention, they are torn from it as from the only good in\r\nthis, world, and return to their home as to a place of exile and\r\ncondemnation. Their eyes are forever turned back to the object they\r\nhave lost, and its recollection poisons the residue of their lives.\r\nTheir first and most delicate passions are hackneyed on unworthy\r\nobjects here, and they carry home the dregs, insufficient to make\r\nthemselves or anybody else happy. Add to this, that a habit of\r\nidleness, an inability to apply themselves to business is acquired, and\r\nrenders them useless to themselves and their country. These\r\nobservations are founded in experience. There is no place where your\r\npursuit of knowledge will be so little obstructed by foreign objects,\r\nas in your own country, nor any, wherein the virtues of the heart will\r\nbe less exposed to be weakened. Be good, be learned, and be\r\nindustrious, and you will not want the aid of travelling, to render you\r\nprecious to your country, dear to your friends, happy within yourself.\r\nI repeat my advice, to take a great deal of exercise, and on foot.\r\nHealth is the first requisite after morality. Write to me often, and be\r\nassured of the interest I take in your success, as well as the warmth\r\nof those sentiments of attachment with which I am, dear Peter, your\r\naffectionate friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. GEORGE GILMER.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 11, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,--Your letter of January the 9th, 1787, came safely to hand\r\nin the month of June last. Unluckily you forgot to sign it, and your\r\nhandwriting is so Protean, that one cannot be sure it is yours. To\r\nincrease the causes of incertitude, it was dated _Pen-park_, a name\r\nwhich I only know, as the seat of John Harmer. The handwriting, too,\r\nbeing somewhat in his style, made me ascribe it hastily to him, indorse\r\nit with his name, and let it lie in my bundle to be answered at\r\nleisure. That moment of leisure arriving, I set down to answer it to\r\nJohn Harmer, and now, for the first time, discover marks of its being\r\nyours, and particularly those expressions of friendship to myself and\r\nfamily, which you have ever been so good as to entertain, and which are\r\nto me among the most precious possessions. I wish my sense of this, and\r\nmy desires of seeing you rich and happy, may not prevent my seeing any\r\ndifficulty in the case you state of George Harmer's wills; which as you\r\nstate them, are thus:\r\n\r\n1. A will, dated December the 26th, 1779, written in his own hand, and\r\ndevising to his brother the estates he had received from him.\r\n\r\n2. Another will, dated June the 25th, 1782, written also in his own\r\nhand, devising his estate to trustees, to be conveyed to such of his\r\nrelations. I. H. I. L. or H. L. as should become capable of acquiring\r\nproperty, or, on failure of that, to be sold and the money remitted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n3. A third will, dated September the 12th, 1786, devising all his\r\nestate at Marrowbone, and his tracts at Horse-pasture and Poison-field\r\nto you; which will is admitted to record, and of course, has been duly\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nYou say the learned are divided on these wills. Yet I see no cause of\r\ndivision, as it requires little learning to decide, that \"the first\r\ndeed and last will must always prevail.\" I am afraid, therefore, the\r\ndifficulty may arise on the want of words of inheritance in the devise\r\nto you; for you state it as a devise to \"George Gilmer\" (without adding\r\n\"and to his heirs,\") of \"all the _estate_ called Marrowbone,\" \"the\r\n_tract_ called Horse-pasture,\" and \"the _tract_ called Poison-field.\"\r\nIf the question is on this point, and you have copied the words of the\r\nwill exactly, I suppose you take an estate in fee simple in Marrowbone,\r\nand for life only in Horse-pasture and Poison-field; the want of words\r\nof inheritance in the two last cases, being supplied as to the first,\r\nby the word \"estate,\" which has been repeatedly decided to be\r\ndescriptive of the quantum of interest devised, as well as of its\r\nlocality. I am in hopes, however, you have not copied the words\r\nexactly, that there are words of inheritance to all the devises, as the\r\ntestator certainly knew their necessity, and that the conflict only\r\nwill be between the different wills, in which case I see nothing which\r\ncan be opposed to the last. I shall be very happy to eat at Pen-park,\r\nsome of the good mutton and beef of Marrowbone, Horse-pasture and\r\nPoison-field, with yourself and Mrs. Gilmer, and my good old neighbors.\r\nI am as happy nowhere else, and in no other society, and all my wishes\r\nend, where I hope my days will end, at Monticello. Too many scenes of\r\nhappiness mingle themselves with all the recollections of my native\r\nwoods and fields, to suffer them to be supplanted in my affection by\r\nany other. I consider myself here as a traveller only, and not a\r\nresident. My commission expires next spring, and if not renewed, I\r\nshall, of course, return then. If renewed, I shall remain here some\r\ntime longer. How much, I cannot say; yet my wishes shorten the period.\r\nAmong the strongest inducements will be, that of your society and Mrs.\r\nGilmer's, which I am glad to find brought more within reach, by your\r\nreturn to Pen-park. My daughters are importunate to return also. Patsy\r\nenjoys good health, and is growing to my stature. Maria arrived here\r\nabout a month ago, after a favorable voyage, and in perfect health. My\r\nown health has been as good as ever, after the first year's probation.\r\nIf you knew how agreeable to me are the details of the small news of my\r\nneighborhood, your charity would induce you to write frequently. Your\r\nletters lodged in the post office at Richmond (to be forwarded to New\r\nYork) come with certainty. We are doubtful yet, whether there will be\r\nwar or not. Present me with warm affection to Mrs. Gilmer, and be\r\nassured yourself of the unvarying sentiments of esteem and attachment,\r\nwith which I am, dear Doctor, your sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL T. M. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 11, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Ammonett sent me your favor of May 7, which you expected\r\nhe would have brought. He furnished me with the name of the family to\r\nwhose property he supposes himself entitled, and the name of the town\r\nwhere it lies. I have endeavored to have them searched out, but as yet\r\nneither family nor town is discovered. If they can be found, the estate\r\nwill then have to be searched for; the laws for limitation of actions\r\nwill form the next opposition to him, and probably the laws of\r\nforfeiture against the Protestants, who were the subject of the\r\nrevocation of the edict of Nantes, which laws have never been repealed,\r\nnor probably ever will be, even should the future condition of\r\nProtestants here be mitigated. I shall proceed in the enquiry for him,\r\nand let him know the result.\r\n\r\nYour son Thomas, at Edinburgh, has done me the favor to open a little\r\ncorrespondence with me. He has sometimes asked my advice as to the\r\ncourse of his studies, which I have given to him the more freely as he\r\ninformed me he was not tied down to any particular plan by your\r\ninstructions. He informed me in his last letter that you proposed he\r\nshould come to Paris this fall, stay here the winter, and return to\r\nVirginia in the spring. I understand him as proposing to study the law,\r\nso that probably, on his return, you will place him at Williamsburg for\r\nthat purpose. On this view of his destination I venture to propose to\r\nyou another plan. The law may be studied as well in one place as\r\nanother; because it is a study of books alone, at least till near the\r\nclose of it. Books can be read equally well at Williamsburg, at London,\r\nor Paris. The study of the law is an affair of three years, the last of\r\nwhich should be spent in attending Mr. Wythe's lectures. Upon the plan\r\nhe has now in expectation, his residence here six months as a\r\ntraveller, must cost him two hundred guineas, and three years' study at\r\nWilliamsburg, four hundred and fifty guineas more, making five hundred\r\nand fifty guineas in the whole. My proposition is that he shall pass\r\nhis two first years of legal study in some one of the villages within\r\nan hour's walk of Paris, boarded with some good family, wherein he may\r\nlearn to speak the language, which is not to be learned in any other\r\nway. By this means he will avoid the loss of time and money which would\r\nbe the consequence of a residence in the town, and he will be nigh\r\nenough to come to dine, to make acquaintances, see good company, and\r\nexamine the useful details of the city. With very great economy he may\r\ndo this on one hundred guineas a year, but at his ease for one hundred\r\nand fifty guineas. At the end of two years I would propose him a\r\njourney through the southern parts of France, thence to Genoa, Leghorn,\r\nFlorence, Rome, Naples, Venice, Milan, Turin, Geneva, Lyons and Paris.\r\nThis will employ him seven months, and cost him three hundred and\r\nthirty guineas, if he goes alone, or two hundred and thirty guineas if\r\nhe finds a companion. Then he should return to Virginia, and pass his\r\nthird year of legal study in attending Mr. Wythe's lectures. This whole\r\nplan would take three years and seven months, and cost from seven\r\nhundred to seven hundred and fifty guineas, which would be one month\r\nlonger, and one hundred and fifty or two hundred guineas dearer than\r\nthe one proposed. The advantages of this would be his learning to speak\r\nFrench well, his acquiring a better acquaintance here with men and\r\nthings, and his having travelled through the most interesting parts of\r\nEurope, advantages which he will forever think cheaply purchased for\r\none hundred and fifty or two hundred guineas, even were a deduction of\r\nthat sum to be made from the establishment you mean to give him. But in\r\nevery case, whether you decide that he shall return to study in\r\nVirginia, or remain here for that purpose, I would recommend that he\r\nshould not be tied down to quit Edinburgh this fall precisely, but only\r\nwhen he shall have finished his courses of lectures in those sciences\r\nwith which he should not be unacquainted. I have taken the liberty of\r\nnoting these to him. I perceive by his letters that he has a good\r\ngenius, and everybody bears witness to his application, which is almost\r\ntoo great. It would be a pity, therefore, he should miss of giving them\r\nfull encouragement. I must beg your pardon for thus intruding myself\r\ninto a business belonging to yourself alone, and hope you will find its\r\nexcuse in the motives from which it proceeds, friendship for yourself,\r\nMrs. Randolph and your son. I wish to see you gratified, and to be\r\ngratified myself in seeing him act the advantageous part, which will\r\nnaturally result from his talents, his merit, and the favorable ground\r\nfrom which he will start; a fear of seeing this endangered by a too\r\nearly return to our own country where the example of his cotemporaries\r\nmay soon possibly lead him from the regular pursuits his friends may\r\nchalk out for him, all these considerations have impelled me to take\r\nthis liberty, and to rely for pardon on the assurance of the sincere\r\nattachment and respect with which I am, dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REVEREND JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 13, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have been long, very long, without answering your favor of\r\nMarch 27, 1786, and since that I have received those of December 28,\r\nand by Mrs. Oster. The reason of this has been that the genius of\r\ninvention and improvement in Europe seems to be absolutely taking a\r\nnap. We have nothing to communicate to you but of the small kind, such\r\nas making the axletree turn with the wheel, which has been proposed\r\nhere, adopted by some, and thought to be proved best by experiment,\r\nthough theory has nothing to urge in its favor. A hydrostatic waistcoat\r\nis lately announced, which a person puts on either above or below his\r\nclothes in a minute, and fills with air by blowing with the mouth in\r\ntwelve seconds. It is not yet shown, however, so I cannot tell you\r\neither the manner or matter of its construction. It may be useful when\r\nthe loss of a vessel is foreseen. Herschell's discovery of two\r\nsatellites to his planet, you have heard of ere this. He first saw them\r\nin January last. One revolves round its principal in about a week; the\r\nother in about a fortnight. I think your conjecture that the periodical\r\nvariation of light in certain fixed stars proceeds from Maculae, is more\r\nprobable than that of Maupertius, who supposes those bodies may be\r\nflat, and more probable also than that which supposes the star to have\r\nan orbit of revolution so large as to vary sensibly its degree of\r\nlight. The latter is rendered more difficult of belief from the\r\nshortness of the period of variation. I thank you for the shells you\r\nsent me. Their identity with marine shells and their vicinity to the\r\nsea, argue an identity of cause. But still the shells found in the\r\nmountains are very imperfectly accounted for. I have lately become\r\nacquainted with a memoire on a petrification mixed with shells by a\r\nMonsieur de La Sauvagere, giving an exact account of what Voltaire had\r\nerroneously stated in his questions Encyclopediques, article Coquilles,\r\nfrom whence I had transferred it into my notes. Having been lately at\r\nTours, I had an opportunity of enquiring into de La Sauvagere's\r\ncharacter, and the facts he states. The result was entirely in his and\r\ntheir favor. This fact is so curious, so circumstantially detailed, and\r\nyet so little like any known operation of nature, that it throws the\r\nmind under absolute suspense. The memoir is out of print. But my\r\nbookseller is now in search of it, and if he can find it I will put a\r\ncopy of it into a box of books I shall send by the September packet,\r\naddressed to Mr. Wythe. In the same box I will put for you the\r\nBibliotheque Physico-economique, for 1786, 1787, the connoissance des\r\ntems, Fourcroy's Chemistry, wherein all the later discoveries are\r\ndigested, and a number of my notes on Virginia, of a copy of which you\r\nwill be pleased to accept. It is a poor crayon, which yourself and the\r\ngentlemen which issue from your school must fill up. We are doubtful\r\nhere whether we are to have peace or war. The movements of Prussia and\r\nEngland indicate war; the finances of England and France indicate\r\npeace. I think the two last will endeavor to accommodate the Dutch\r\ndifferences. Be pleased to present me respectfully to Mrs. Madison, and\r\nafter repeating the recommendation of my nephew to you, I take the\r\nliberty of assuring you of that esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE J. BLAIR.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 13, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received the letter with which you were pleased to honor\r\nme, by Mrs. Oster, and immediately waited on her with a tender of my\r\nservices. She had, however, so far got her matters arranged as to be no\r\nlonger in fear of any disagreeable measure, and is since gone to\r\nestablish herself with her friends in Lorraine. I wish she may not\r\nthere have alarms of a different nature. We have hitherto been in hopes\r\nthat the desperate state of the finances of France and England would\r\nindispose those powers to war, and induce them, by an armed mediation,\r\nto quiet the affairs of Holland. The actual march, however, of the\r\nPrussian troops, the departure of the British squadron somewhere\r\nwestwardly, and the preparations for a naval armament at Brest, and a\r\nland one in the neighborhood of the Netherlands, render war at present\r\nmore expected than it has been. Still we look to the necessities of the\r\ntwo principal powers as promising efficacy to the negotiations not yet\r\nbroken off. Though we shall be neutrals, and as such shall derive\r\nconsiderable pecuniary advantages, yet I think we shall lose in\r\nhappiness and morals by being launched again into the ocean of\r\nspeculation, led to overtrade ourselves, tempted to become sea-robbers\r\nunder French colors, and to quit the pursuits of agriculture, the\r\nsurest road to affluence and best preservative of morals. Perhaps, too,\r\nit may divert the attention of the States from those great political\r\nimprovements, which the honorable body, of which you are a member,\r\nwill, I hope, propose to them. What these may be, I know not, but I am\r\nsure they will be what they should be. My idea is that we should be\r\nmade one nation in every case concerning foreign affairs, and separate\r\nones in whatever is merely domestic; that the Federal government should\r\nbe organized into Legislative, Executive and Judiciary, as are the\r\nState governments, and some peaceable means of enforcement devised for\r\nthe Federal head over the States. But of all these things you are a\r\nbetter judge. I have delivered your message to Mr. Mazzei, who is still\r\nhere. Be so good as to present me respectfully to Mrs. Blair, and to be\r\nassured yourself of the sentiments of esteem and respect with which I\r\nhave the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH JONES.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 14, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have never yet thanked you, but with the heart, for the\r\nact of Assembly confirming the agreement with Maryland, the pamphlet\r\nand papers I received from you a twelve month ago. Very soon after\r\ntheir receipt, I got my right wrist dislocated, which prevented me long\r\nfrom writing, and as soon as that was able to bear it, I took a long\r\njourney, from which I am but lately returned. I am anxious to hear what\r\nour federal convention recommends, and what the States will do in\r\nconsequence of their recommendation. * * * * With all the defects of\r\nour constitution, whether general or particular, the comparison of our\r\ngovernments with those of Europe, is like a comparison of heaven and\r\nhell. England, like the earth, may be allowed to take the intermediate\r\nstation. And yet, I hear there are people among you, who think the\r\nexperience of our governments has already proved, that republican\r\ngovernments will not answer. Send those gentry here, to count the\r\nblessings of monarchy. A king's sister, for instance, stopped on the\r\nroad, and on a hostile journey, is sufficient cause for him to march\r\nimmediately twenty thousand men to revenge this insult, when he had\r\nshown himself little moved by the matter of right then in question.\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nFrom all these broils we are happily free, and that God may keep us\r\nlong so, and yourself in health and happiness, is the prayer of, dear\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 14, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am happy to find, by the letter of August the 1st, 1786,\r\nwhich you did me the honor to write to me, that the modern dress for\r\nyour statue would meet your approbation. I found it strongly the\r\nsentiment of West, Copley, Trumbull, and Brown, in London; after which,\r\nit would be ridiculous to add, that it was my own. I think a modern in\r\nan antique dress as just an object of ridicule as a Hercules or Marius\r\nwith a periwig and a chapeau bras.\r\n\r\nI remember having written to you, while Congress sat at Annapolis, on\r\nthe water communication between ours and the western country, and to\r\nhave mentioned particularly the information I had received of the plain\r\nface of the country between the sources of Big Beaver and Cayohoga,\r\nwhich made me hope that a canal of no great expense might unite the\r\nnavigation of Lake Erie and the Ohio. You must since have had occasion\r\nof getting better information on this subject, and if you have, you\r\nwould oblige me by a communication of it. I consider this canal, if\r\npracticable, as a very important work.\r\n\r\nI remain in hopes of great and good effects from the decision of the\r\nAssembly over which you are presiding. To make our States one as to all\r\nforeign concerns, preserve them several as to all merely domestic, to\r\ngive to the federal head some peaceable mode of enforcing its just\r\nauthority, to organize that head into legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary apartments, are great desiderata in our federal constitution.\r\nYet with all its defects, and with all those of our particular\r\ngovernments, the inconveniences resulting from them, are so light in\r\ncomparison with those existing in every other government on earth, that\r\nour citizens may certainly be considered as in the happiest political\r\nsituation which exists.\r\n\r\nThe Assemblee des Notables has been productive of much good in this\r\ncountry. The reformation of some of the most oppressive laws has taken\r\nplace, and is taking place. The allotment of the State into subordinate\r\ngovernments, the administration of which is committed to persons chosen\r\nby the people, will work in time a very beneficial change in their\r\nconstitution. The expense of the trappings of monarchy, too, is\r\nlightening. Many of the useless officers, high and low, of the King,\r\nQueen, and Princes, are struck off. Notwithstanding all this, the\r\ndiscovery of the abominable abuses of public money by the late\r\nComptroller General, some new expenses of the court, not of a piece\r\nwith the projects of reformation, and the imposition of new taxes,\r\nhave, in the course of a few weeks, raised a spirit of discontent in\r\nthis nation, so great and so general, as to threaten serious\r\nconsequences. The parliaments in general, and particularly that of\r\nParis, put themselves at the head of this effervescence, and direct its\r\nobject to the calling the States General, who have not been assembled\r\nsince 1614. The object is to fix a constitution, and to limit expenses.\r\nThe King has been obliged to hold a bed of justice, to enforce the\r\nregistering the new taxes; the parliament, on their side, propose to\r\nissue a prohibition against their execution. Very possibly this may\r\nbring on their exile. The mild and patriotic character of the new\r\nministry, is the principal dependence against this extremity.\r\n\r\nThe turn which the affairs of Europe will take, is not yet decided.\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nA war, wherein France, Holland, and England should be parties, seems,\r\n_prima facie_, to promise much advantage to us. But in the first place,\r\nno war can be safe for us which threatens France with an unfavorable\r\nissue; and in the next, it will probably embark us again into the ocean\r\nof speculation, engage us to over-trade ourselves, convert us into\r\nsea-rovers, under French and Dutch colors, divert us from agriculture,\r\nwhich is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute most\r\nto real wealth, good morals, and happiness. The wealth acquired by\r\nspeculation and plunder, is fugacious in its nature, and fills society\r\nwith the spirit of gambling. The moderate and sure income of husbandry\r\nbegets permanent improvement, quiet life, and orderly conduct, both\r\npublic and private. We have no occasion for more commerce than to take\r\noff our superfluous produce, and the people complain that some\r\nrestrictions prevent this; yet the price of articles with us, in\r\ngeneral, shows the contrary. Tobacco, indeed, is low, not because we\r\ncannot carry it where we please, but because we make more than the\r\nconsumption requires. Upon the whole I think peace advantageous to us,\r\nnecessary for Europe, and desirable for humanity. A few days will\r\ndecide, probably, whether all these considerations are to give way to\r\nthe bad passions of Kings, and those who would be Kings.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. August 15. The parliament is exiled to Troyes this morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 14, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I remember when you left us, it was with a promise to supply\r\nall the defects of correspondence with our friends, of which we\r\ncomplained, and which you had felt in common with us. Yet I have\r\nreceived but one letter from you, which was dated June the 5th, 1786,\r\nand I answered it, August the 14th, 1786. Dropping that, however, and\r\nbeginning a new account, I will observe to you, that wonderful\r\nimprovements are making here in various lines. In architecture, the\r\nwall of circumvallation round Paris, and the palaces by which we are to\r\nbe let out and in, are nearly completed; four hospitals are to be built\r\ninstead of the old Hotel-Dieu; one of the old bridges has all its\r\nhouses demolished, and a second nearly so; a new bridge is begun at the\r\nPlace Louis XV.; the Palais Royale is gutted, a considerable part in\r\nthe centre of the garden being dug out, and a subterranean circus\r\nbegun, wherein will be equestrian exhibitions, &c. In society, the\r\nhabit habille is almost banished, and they begin to go even to great\r\nsuppers in frock: the court and diplomatic corps, however, must always\r\nbe excepted. They are too high to be reached by any improvement. They\r\nare the last refuge from which etiquette, formality, and folly will be\r\ndriven. Take away these, and they would be on a level with other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n[After describing the unsettled state of Europe, as in some of the\r\npreceding letters, the writer proceeds:]\r\n\r\nSo much for the blessings of having Kings, and magistrates who would be\r\nKings. From these events, our young Republic may learn useful lessons,\r\nnever to call on foreign powers to settle their differences, to guard\r\nagainst hereditary magistrates, to prevent their citizens from becoming\r\nso established in wealth and power, as to be thought worthy of alliance\r\nby marriage with the nieces, sisters, &c., of Kings, and, in short, to\r\nbesiege the throne of heaven with eternal prayers, to extirpate from\r\ncreation this class of human lions, tigers, and mammoths called Kings;\r\nfrom whom, let him perish who does not say, \"good Lord deliver us;\" and\r\nthat so we may say, one and all, or perish, is the fervent prayer of\r\nhim who has the honor to mix with it, sincere wishes for your health\r\nand happiness, and to be, with real attachment and respect, dear Sir,\r\nyour affectionate friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 15, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--An American gentleman leaving Paris this afternoon to go by the\r\nway of L'Orient to Boston, furnishes me the rare occasion of a\r\nconveyance, other than the packet, sure and quick. My letter by the\r\npacket informed you of the bed of justice, for enregistering the stamp\r\ntax and land tax. The parliament, on their return, came to an _Arretee_\r\n(a resolution) which, besides protesting against the enregistering, as\r\ndone by force, laid the foundation for an _Arret de defence_ (an act)\r\nagainst the execution of the two new laws. The question on the final\r\n_Arret_ was adjourned to the day before yesterday. It is believed they\r\ndid not conclude on this _Arret_, as it has not appeared. However,\r\nthere was a concourse of about ten thousand people at the parliament\r\nhouse, who, on their adjournment, received them with acclamations of\r\njoy, loosened the horses of the most eminent speakers against the tax\r\nfrom their carriages, and drew them home. This morning, the parliament\r\nis exiled to Troyes. It is believed to proceed, principally, from the\r\nfear of a popular commotion here.\r\n\r\nThe officer, charged by this court to watch the English squadron, which\r\nwas under sailing orders, returned about a week ago, with information\r\nthat it had sailed, having shaped its course westwardly. This is\r\nanother step towards war. It is the more suspicious, as their minister\r\nhere denies the fact. Count Adhemar is here from London, by leave from\r\nhis court. The Duke of Dorset, the British ambassador here, has lately\r\ngone to London on leave. Neither of these ambassadors has the\r\nconfidence of his court, on the point of abilities. The latter merits\r\nit for his honesty. The minister of the British court, resident here,\r\nremains; but Mr. Eden, their ambassador to Spain, under pretence of\r\ntaking this in his route, is in truth their _factotum_ in the present\r\nemergency. Nothing worth noting has occurred since my last, either in\r\nthe Dutch or Austrian Netherlands.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 15, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A gentleman going from hence by L'Orient to Boston,\r\nfurnishes me an opportunity of recommending to your care the enclosed\r\nletters, which I could not get ready for the last packet. Pray inform\r\nme in your next whether letters directed to your foreign ministers, or\r\nfranked by them, are free of postage; that they ought to be so is\r\nacknowledged substantially by the resolution of Congress, allowing us\r\nto charge postages. I have sometimes suspected that my letters stagnate\r\nin the post-offices. My letters by the last packet brought down the\r\ndomestic news of this country to the day in which the bed of justice\r\nwas held. The day before yesterday the parliament house was surrounded\r\nby ten thousand people, who received them on their adjournment with\r\nacclamations of joy, took out the horses of the principal speakers and\r\ndrew their chariots themselves to their hotels. The parliament not\r\nhaving taken the desperate step (as far as is yet known) of forbidding\r\nthe execution of the new tax laws by an _Arret de defence sur peine de\r\nmort_, we presume it is the fear of a popular commotion which has\r\noccasioned the King to exile them to Troyes. This is known only this\r\nmorning. The ministry here have certain information that the English\r\nsquadron has sailed and took its course westwardly. This is another\r\nmove towards war. No other important fact has taken place since my\r\nletter by the packet. Adieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DEL VERMI.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 15, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--In consequence of the permission you were so kind as to give me,\r\nwhen I had the honor of seeing you at Milan, I shall sometimes take the\r\nliberty of troubling you with a line. I cannot begin with an act of\r\ngreater justice than that of expressing to you all my gratitude for\r\nyour attentions and services while in your capital, and to which I am\r\nindebted for the best informations I received there. I then mentioned\r\nsome late publications on the subject of America, of which I would do\r\nmyself the honor of sending you one, because it was my own, and two\r\nothers because worth reading. Mine are some notes only on the State of\r\nVirginia. The others are Ramsay's history of the war and Soule's\r\nhistory. The first is very authentic, there being no fact in it which\r\nmay not be relied on; but it is confined to the war in the southern\r\nStates. The last is a general history, of which we can only say it is\r\nthe best of those written in Europe. There is a history of the same\r\nperiod now printing in London, though written in America by an English\r\nclergyman of the name of Gordon. He had access to some collections of\r\npapers not known to any other writer. But I am unable to say as yet\r\nwhat may be the merit of his work. You must have observed when in\r\nAmerica, that time and trial had discovered defects in our federal\r\nconstitution. A new essay, made in the midst of the flames of war,\r\ncould not be perfect. The States have appointed deputies, who are now\r\nsitting at Philadelphia, to consider what are the defects, and to\r\npropose new articles to be added to the instrument of confederation for\r\namending them. The articles to be proposed by them will have to be\r\nconfirmed by Congress and by the Legislature of every State before they\r\nwill be in force. As yet their proceedings are not known. Probably they\r\ngo to the following points: 1. To invest Congress with the exclusive\r\nsovereignty in every matter relative to foreign nations and the general\r\nmass of our Union, retaining to the States their individual sovereignty\r\nin matters merely domestic. 2. To devise some peaceable mode whereby\r\nCongress may enforce their decisions. 3. To organize Congress into\r\nthree branches, Legislative, Executive and Judiciary. I had the honor\r\nof informing you of the commotions which had taken place in\r\nMassachusetts, the only ones which had ever taken place since the\r\ndeclaration of Independence. I have now that of informing you that\r\nthose commotions have been entirely quieted. General Washington is\r\nwell, and is president of the federal convention sitting at\r\nPhiladelphia, as before mentioned. Dr. Franklin and others, the\r\ngreatest characters of America, are members of it. I do not give you\r\nEuropean news; you have that from other quarters; after adding\r\ntherefore, that the books before mentioned, are delivered to Messieurs\r\nCathalan, of Marseilles, who will send them to their correspondent at\r\nGenoa, with instructions to forward them to you at Milan. I shall only\r\nrepeat very sincere assurances of the esteem and respect with which I\r\nhave the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, August 30, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since your favor of July the 10th, mine have been of July\r\nthe 17th, 23d and 28th. The last enclosed a bill of exchange from Mr.\r\nGrand, on Tessier for L46, 17s. 10d. sterling, to answer General\r\nSullivan's bill for that sum. I hope it got safe to hand, though I have\r\nbeen anxious about it, as it went by post, and my letters through that\r\nchannel sometimes miscarry.\r\n\r\nFrom the separation of the Notables to the present moment, has been\r\nperhaps the most interesting interval ever known in this country. The\r\npropositions of the government, approved by the Notables, were precious\r\nto the nation, and have been in an honest course of execution, some of\r\nthem being carried into effect, and others preparing. Above all, the\r\nestablishment of the Provincial Assemblies, some of which have begun\r\ntheir sessions, bid fair to be the instrument for circumscribing the\r\npower of the crown, and raising the people into consideration. The\r\nelection given to them, is what will do this. Though the minister, who\r\nproposed these improvements, seems to have meant them as the price of\r\nthe new supplies, the game has been so played, as to secure the\r\nimprovements to the nation, without securing the price. The Notables\r\nspoke softly on the subject of the additional supplies. But the\r\nparliament took them up roundly, refused to register the edicts for the\r\nnew taxes, till compelled in a bed of justice, and suffered themselves\r\nto be transferred to Troyes, rather than withdraw their opposition. It\r\nis urged principally against the King, that his revenue is one hundred\r\nand thirty millions more than that of his predecessor was, and yet he\r\ndemands one hundred and twenty millions further. You will see this well\r\nexplained in the \"Conference entre un ministre d'etat et un Conseiller\r\nau parliment,\" which I send you, with some small pamphlets. In the\r\nmeantime, all tongues in Paris (and in France as it is said) have been\r\nlet loose, and never was a license of speaking against the government\r\nexercised in London more freely or more universally. Caricatures,\r\nplacards, bons mots, have been indulged in by all ranks of people, and\r\nI know of no well-attested instance of a single punishment. For some\r\ntime mobs of ten, twenty and thirty thousand people collected daily,\r\nsurrounded the parliament house, huzzaed the members, even entered the\r\ndoors and examined into their conduct, took the horses out of the\r\ncarriages of those who did well, and drew them home. The government\r\nthought it prudent to prevent these, drew some regiments into the\r\nneighborhood, multiplied the guards, had the streets constantly\r\npatrolled by strong parties, suspended privileged places, forbade all\r\nclubs, etc. The mobs have ceased; perhaps this may be partly owing to\r\nthe absence of parliament. The Count d'Artois, sent to hold a bed of\r\njustice in the Cour des Aides, was hissed and hooted without reserve,\r\nby the populace; the carriage of Madame de (I forget the name) in the\r\nQueen's livery was stopped by the populace, under a belief that it was\r\nMadame de Polignac, whom they would have insulted; the Queen, going to\r\nthe theatre at Versailles with Madame de Polignac, was received with a\r\ngeneral hiss. The King, long in the habit of drowning his cares in\r\nwine, plunges deeper and deeper. The Queen cries, but sins on. The\r\nCount d'Artois is detested, and Monsieur, the general favorite. The\r\nArchbishop of Thoulouse is made minister principal, a virtuous,\r\npatriotic, and able character. The Marechal de Castries retired\r\nyesterday, notwithstanding strong solicitations to remain in office.\r\nThe Marechal de Segur retired at the same time, prompted to it by the\r\ncourt. Their successors are not yet known. Monsieur de St. Priest goes\r\nambassador to Holland, in the room of Verac, transferred to\r\nSwitzerland, and the Count de Moustier goes to America, in the room of\r\nthe Chevalier de La Luzerne, who has a promise of the first vacancy.\r\nThese nominations are not yet made formally, but they are decided on,\r\nand the parties are ordered to prepare for their destination.\r\n\r\nAs it has been long since I have had a confidential conveyance to you,\r\nI have brought together the principal facts from the adjournment of the\r\nNotables to the present moment, which, as you will perceive from their\r\nnature, required a confidential conveyance. I have done it the rather,\r\nbecause, though you will have heard many of them, and seen them in the\r\npublic papers, yet, floating in the mass of lies which constitute the\r\natmosphere of London and Paris, you may not have been sure of their\r\ntruth; and I have mentioned every truth of any consequence, to enable\r\nyou to stamp as false, the facts pretermitted. I think that in the\r\ncourse of three months, the royal authority has lost, and the rights of\r\nthe nation gained, as much ground by a revolution of public opinion\r\nonly, as England gained in all her civil wars under the Stuarts. I\r\nrather believe, too, they will retain the ground gained, because it is\r\ndefended by the young and the middle aged, in opposition to the old\r\nonly. The first party increases, and the latter diminishes daily, from\r\nthe course of nature. You may suppose, that in this situation, war\r\nwould be unwelcome to France. She will surely avoid it, if not forced\r\ninto it by the courts of London and Berlin. If forced, it is probable\r\nshe will change the system of Europe totally, by an alliance with the\r\ntwo empires, to whom nothing would be more desirable. In the event of\r\nsuch a coalition, not only Prussia, but the whole European world must\r\nreceive from them their laws. But France will probably endeavor to\r\npreserve the present system, if it can be done, by sacrificing to a\r\ncertain degree, the pretensions of the Patriotic party in Holland. But\r\nof all these matters, you can judge, in your position, where less\r\nsecrecy is observed, better than I can.\r\n\r\nI have news from America as late as July the 19th. Nothing had\r\ntranspired from the federal convention. I am sorry they began their\r\ndeliberations by so abominable a precedent as that of tying up the\r\ntongues of their members. Nothing can justify this example but the\r\ninnocence of their intentions, and ignorance of the value of public\r\ndiscussions. I have no doubt that all their other measures will be good\r\nand wise. It is really an assembly of demigods. General Washington was\r\nof opinion, that they should not separate till October.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with every sentiment of friendship and respect,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 8, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of addressing your Excellency on the 3d of July,\r\nsome observations on the letter of Monsieur de Calonnes, of October\r\n22d, 1786, relative to the commerce of France with the United States of\r\nAmerica; of proposing to it some small amendments, and of expressing a\r\nwish that it might be put into such a form as would secure its\r\nexecution. Monsieur de Villedeuil, then Comptroller General was pleased\r\nto inform me that the Farmers General had received orders on the first\r\nof April, 1787, to conform themselves to the decisions notified in that\r\nletter, and that on the 5th of the same month they had given orders not\r\nto levy \"sur les _huiles_ et autres produits de la _peche Americane_\r\nque les droits mentionnes dans la lettre.\" This expression, restrained\r\nto the produce of the _fisheries_, with recent information received\r\nfrom the American agent at Havre, make me apprehensive that the ancient\r\nduties are still demanded on all other objects, and induce me to repeat\r\nto your Excellency my request that the letter of M. de Calonnes may be\r\nput into such form as will insure its execution and stability. In my\r\nletter of July 25th, I took the liberty of proposing that timely\r\nmeasures might be adopted for encouraging the direct importation of the\r\ntobacco of the United States into this Kingdom when the order of Bernis\r\nshould be expired, and that in the meantime that order might be\r\nstrictly executed. A great accumulation of tobaccos in the seaports of\r\nFrance, and a refusal of the Farmers General to purchase any more, on\r\nthe pretence that they have purchased the whole quantity required by\r\ngovernment, excites discontent among the merchants. It is their opinion\r\nthat the Farms have not complied with the order of Bernis. As the\r\ngovernment was pleased to desire the publication of that order to\r\ninduce the merchants to bring tobaccos here, it would be very\r\nsatisfactory to make known also the execution of that order. If the\r\nFarms can verify that they have strictly executed it, all discontent\r\nwill cease and the merchants become sensible that the present glut is\r\noccasioned by their importing too much. On the other hand, if it shall\r\nappear, from the list of purchases made by the Farms, or from other\r\nevidence, that they have not purchased the whole quantity on the\r\nconditions prescribed by government, they will doubtless be instructed\r\nto do it, and that too without delay, as the duration of the contract\r\nwith Mr. Morris, and of the order of Bernis, formed on that, will soon\r\nexpire.\r\n\r\nA parcel of gazettes and magazines sent to me from America, for my own\r\nuse, and detained in the syndic chamber, obliges me to trouble your\r\nExcellency for an order for their delivery.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LIMOSIN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Sept. 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--Immediately on the receipt of your favor of the 31st of August, I\r\nwaited on the person who is charged with the superintendence of the\r\nconduct of the Farms, and informed him that the customhouse officers\r\nhad required the ancient duties on a cargo of pearlash, arrived at\r\nHavre. He observed to me that the duties promised to be abolished by\r\nthe King were only those due to himself or the Farms; but that there\r\nwere _droits loceaux_, which he could not abolish; that the officers of\r\nthe customs might have demanded the droits loceaux, but that it was\r\nimpossible they should have demanded any other duties. If they have\r\ndone so, I will beg the favor of you to send me such evidence of the\r\ndemand as will enable me to press for a proper notice of the Farms, if\r\nthey have failed to give orders, or a punishment of the officer, if he\r\nhas failed to obey them.\r\n\r\nNo further changes in the government since my last. The office of\r\nDirecteur du tresor royal was offered to M. de La Borde and refused by\r\nhim. Had no accident intervened, I think the affairs of the Dutch would\r\nhave been arranged without producing any war immediately. They are even\r\nat this moment in a train of negotiation. But, in the meantime, a war\r\nhas broke out between the Russians and Turks. We have no news yet of\r\nany action, but the Turks have imprisoned the Russian Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, and no hope is entertained of preventing hostilities.\r\nConsidering the situation of things in Europe, it seems inevitable that\r\nthis fire must spread over the whole of it. The utmost that can be\r\nhoped, in my opinion, is that the season is so far advanced as that the\r\nother powers of Europe may not be drawn into the vortex of hostilities\r\ntill the ensuing spring. The desire of government to prevent a war,\r\nmight make it disagreeable to them to see this opinion published. I\r\nwill pray you, therefore, to make use of it only for your own\r\ngovernment, and that of the Americans concerned in commerce with your\r\nport. I shall make the same communication to our agents at Nantes and\r\nBordeaux. I have the honor to be, with much esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. T. BLAKE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Sept. 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--Congress do not grant their sea-letters for the East Indies, but\r\nto ships belonging to citizens of the United States, and navigated by\r\nofficers and seamen of the United States. Even the cargo must also\r\nbelong to their own citizens. Nor can these letters be obtained but on\r\nan application to Congress themselves, whereupon they appoint a\r\ncommittee of their own body to enquire into the circumstances relative\r\nto the vessel, cargo and crew, and on their report of the fact, they\r\ngrant or refuse the passport.\r\n\r\nI am, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BONDFIELD.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--The affairs of Holland, though at one moment they had threatened\r\na war, had got into a hopeful train of accommodation, when all of a\r\nsudden a war is kindled between the Russians and Turks. The latter have\r\nimprisoned the Russian Ambassador resident with them, which you know is\r\ntheir manner of declaring war; and though no news of actual hostilities\r\nis yet arrived, every body considers them as inevitable. In the present\r\nstate of Europe, a spark dropped anywhere must kindle the whole. The\r\nonly thing to be hoped is that the advance of the season may prevent\r\nthe other powers from being drawn into the vortex of hostilities, till\r\nthe next spring. But this cannot be depended on. Government here would\r\nstill wish for peace, and may see disagreeably the publication of any\r\nopinion unfriendly to their wish. I will beg of you, therefore, to make\r\nuse of this for your own information only, and that of the persons\r\nconcerned in our commerce from your port. My duty leads me to care of\r\nthem, and my desire to give no offence makes me wish to give no further\r\nalarm. I make the same communication to the ports of Nantes, L'Orient,\r\nand Havre. I am, with much esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DUMAS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 10, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am honored with your favor of the 5th instant, and will forward\r\nthe letter to Mr. Jay by the packet-boat which sails the 25th of this\r\nmonth. I am sorry for the situation in which Mr. Grand's refusal to\r\nmake further advances has placed you. I know its pain, because I\r\nparticipate of it. The aspect of your affairs has also been\r\ndiscouraging. Perhaps the war kindled between Russia and Turkey may\r\nengage your friends, of necessity in measures they wished to avoid, and\r\nmay ultimately relieve you. Our Federal Convention is likely to sit\r\ntill October; there is a general disposition through the States to\r\nadopt what they shall propose, and we may be assured their propositions\r\nwill be wise, as a more able assembly never sat in America. Happily for\r\nus, that when we find our constitutions defective and insufficient to\r\nsecure the happiness of our people, we can assemble with all the\r\ncoolness of philosophers, and set it to rights, while every other\r\nnation on earth must have recourse to arms to amend or to restore their\r\nconstitutions. The sale of our western lands begins this month. I hope\r\nfrom this measure a very speedy reduction of our national debt. It can\r\nonly be applied to pay off the principal, being irrevocably made a\r\nsinking fund for that purpose. I have the honor to be, with much esteem\r\nand respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DON FRANCISCO CHIAPPI.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 15, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have lately received from Mr. Jay, Secretary for foreign\r\naffairs to the United States of America, the enclosed letter from\r\nCongress to his Majesty the Emperor (whom God preserve), and their\r\nratification of the treaty between his Majesty (whom God preserve) and\r\nthe United States, together with an instruction to forward them to you,\r\nto be delivered into the hands of his Majesty (whom God preserve). I am\r\nat the same time to ask the favor of you to deliver the inclosed letter\r\nto Taher Ben Abdelkack Fennish.\r\n\r\nMr. Jay also informs me that Congress had confirmed Mr. Barclay's\r\nappointment of yourself to be their agent at Morocco, of Don Joseph\r\nChiappi to be their agent at Mogador, and Don Girolamo Chiappi to be\r\ntheir agent at Tangier, with which agents it was their desire that\r\ntheir ministers at Versailles and London should regularly correspond;\r\nthat want of time prevented his having and sending to me the certified\r\ncopies of these acts by that opportunity, but that he would do it by\r\nthe next. It will be with singular pleasure that I shall be\r\ninstrumental in forwarding to you these testimonies of the sense which\r\nCongress entertains of your personal merit, and of your dispositions to\r\nbe useful to the citizens of America.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I shall be very happy to receive from you such\r\ncommunications, from time to time, as may be interesting to either\r\nnation, and will avail myself of every occasion of making\r\ncommunications of the same nature to you, and of assuring you of those\r\nsentiments of esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GEORGE WYTHE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Sept. 16, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of Dec.\r\nthe 13th and 22d, 1786, and of Jan., 1787. These should not have been\r\nso long unanswered, but that they arrived during my absence on a\r\njourney of between three and four months through the southern parts of\r\nFrance, and northern of Italy. In the latter country, my time allowed\r\nme to go no farther than Turin, Milan, and Genoa: consequently, I\r\nscarcely got into classical ground. I took with me some of the\r\nwritings, in which endeavors have been made to investigate the passage\r\nof Annibal over the Alps, and was just able to satisfy myself, from a\r\nview of the country, that the descriptions given of his march are not\r\nsufficiently particular to enable us, at this day, even to guess at his\r\ntrack across the Alps. In architecture, painting, sculpture, I found\r\nmuch amusement; but more than all, in their agriculture, many objects\r\nof which might be adopted with us to great advantage. I am persuaded,\r\nthere are many parts of our lower country where the olive tree might be\r\nraised, which is assuredly the richest gift of heaven. I can scarcely\r\nexcept bread. I see this tree supporting thousands among the Alps,\r\nwhere there is not soil enough to make bread for a single family. The\r\ncaper too, might be cultivated with us. The fig we do raise. I do not\r\nspeak of the vine, because it is the parent of misery. Those who\r\ncultivate it are always poor, and he who would employ himself with us\r\nin the culture of corn, cotton, &c., can procure, in exchange for them,\r\nmuch more wine, and better than he could raise by its direct culture.\r\n\r\nI sent you formerly copies of the documents on the Tagliaferro family,\r\nwhich I had received from Mr. Febroni. I now send the originals. I have\r\nprocured for you a copy of Polybius, the best edition; but the best\r\nedition of Vitruvius, which is with the commentaries of Ticinus, is not\r\nto be got here. I have sent to Holland for it. In the meantime, the\r\nPolybius comes in a box containing books for Peter Carr, and for some\r\nof my friends in Williamsburg and its vicinities. I have taken the\r\nliberty of addressing the box to you. It goes to New York in the packet\r\nboat which carries this letter, and will be forwarded to you by water,\r\nby Mr. Madison. Its freight to New York is paid here. The\r\ntransportation from thence to Williamsburg will be demanded of you, and\r\nshall stand as the equivalent to the cost of Polybius and Vitruvius, if\r\nyou please. The difference either way will not be worth the trouble of\r\nraising and transmitting accounts. I send you herewith, a state of the\r\ncontents of the box, and for whom each article is. Among these are\r\nsome, as you will perceive, of which I ask your acceptance. It is a\r\ngreat comfort to me, that while here, I am able to furnish some\r\namusement to my friends, by sending them such productions of genius,\r\nancient and modern, as might otherwise escape them; and I hope they\r\nwill permit me to avail myself of the occasion while it lasts.\r\n\r\nThis world is going all to war. I hope ours will remain clear of it. It\r\nis already declared between the Turks and Russians, and considering the\r\npresent situation of Holland, it cannot fail to spread itself all over\r\nEurope. Perhaps it may not be till next spring, that the other powers\r\nwill be engaged in it: nor is it as yet clear how they will arrange\r\nthemselves. I think it not impossible that France and the two empires\r\nmay join against all the rest. The Patriotic party in Holland will be\r\nsaved by this, and the Turks sacrificed. The only thing which can\r\nprevent the union of France and the two empires, is the difficulty of\r\nagreeing about the partition of the spoils. Constantinople is the key\r\nof Asia. Who shall have it? is the question. I cannot help looking\r\nforward to the re-establishment of the Greeks as a people, and the\r\nlanguage of Homer becoming again a living language, as among possible\r\nevents. You have now with you Mr. Paradise, who can tell you how easily\r\nthe modern may be improved into the ancient Greek.\r\n\r\nYou ask me in your letter, what ameliorations I think necessary in our\r\nfederal constitution. It is now too late to answer the question, and it\r\nwould always have been presumption in me to have done it. Your own\r\nideas, and those of the great characters who were to be concerned with\r\nyou in these discussions, will give the law, as they ought to do, to us\r\nall. My own general idea was, that the States should severally preserve\r\ntheir sovereignty in whatever concerns themselves alone, and that\r\nwhatever may concern another State, or any foreign nation, should be\r\nmade a part of the federal sovereignty; that the exercise of the\r\nfederal sovereignty should be divided among three several bodies,\r\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary, as the State sovereignties are;\r\nand that some peaceable means should be contrived, for the federal head\r\nto force compliance on the part of the States. I have reflected on your\r\nidea of wooden, or ivory diagrams, for the geometrical demonstrations.\r\nI should think wood as good as ivory; and that in this case, it might\r\nadd to the improvement of the young gentlemen, that they should make\r\nthe figures themselves. Being furnished by a workman with a piece of\r\nveneer, no other tool than a penknife and a wooden rule, would be\r\nnecessary. Perhaps pasteboards, or common cards, might be still more\r\nconvenient. The difficulty is, how to reconcile figures which must have\r\na very sensible breadth to our ideas of a mathematical line, which, as\r\nit has neither breadth nor thickness, will revolt more at these than at\r\nsimple lines drawn on paper or slate. If, after reflecting on this\r\nproposition, you would prefer having them made here, lay your commands\r\non me, and they shall be executed.\r\n\r\nI return you a thousand thanks for your goodness to my nephew. After my\r\ndebt to you for whatever I am myself, it is increasing it too much to\r\ninterest yourself for his future fortune. But I know, that to you, a\r\nconsciousness of doing good is a luxury ineffable. You have enjoyed it\r\nalready, beyond all human measure, and that you may long live to enjoy\r\nit, and to bless your country and friends, is the sincere prayer of him\r\nwho is, with every possible sentiment of esteem and respect, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DAVID RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 18, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of April\r\nthe 14th, and June the 26th, as also of the second volume of the\r\ntransactions you were so kind as to send me. It would have been a\r\ngrateful present indeed, could you have accompanied them with a copy of\r\nyour observations on our western country. Besides the interest I feel\r\nin that country in common with others, I have a particular one, as\r\nhaving ventured so many crudities on that subject. A copy of these,\r\nwith some late corrections, I have put into a box of books sent to Mr.\r\nMadison, and another for Mr. Hopkinson. I hope he will forward them to\r\nyou from New York. I have also put into the same box for you a\r\ndissertation, by De la Sauvagere, on the spontaneous growth of shells.\r\nWhen I was at Tours this summer, I inquired into the character of De la\r\nSauvagere, from a gentleman who had known him well. He told me he was a\r\nperson of talents, but of a heated imagination; however, that he might\r\nbe depended on for any facts advanced on his own knowledge. This\r\ngentleman added, that he had seen such proofs of this growth of shells\r\nin many parts of the country round Tours, as to convince him of the\r\ntruth of the fact; and that he has never seen any person, even the most\r\nincredulous, quit those Falunieres but under the same conviction. After\r\nall, I cannot say I give faith to it. It is so unlike the processes of\r\nnature, to produce the same effect in two different ways, that I can\r\nonly bring myself to agree it is not impossible. I have added for you\r\nthe Connoissance des Temps for '88 and '89, and a copy of Fourcroi's\r\nChemistry, which is the best and most complete publication in that\r\nline, which we have had for some time past. I shall be happy to receive\r\nan account of your improvement in timepieces, as well as the third\r\nvolume of the transactions, when published. There are abundance of good\r\nthings in the second volume. But I must say there are several which\r\nhave not merit enough to be placed in such company. I think we should\r\nbe a little rigid in our admission of papers. It is the peculiar\r\nprivilege derived from our not being obliged to publish a volume in any\r\nfixed period of time. A person here pretends to have discovered the\r\nmethod of rendering sea-water potable, and has some respectable\r\ncertificates of its success. He has contrived a varnish, also, for\r\nlining biscuit barrels, which preserves the biscuit good, and keeps it\r\nfree from insects. He asks money for his secrets, so we are not to know\r\nthem soon.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Holland had got so far entangled as to leave little hope\r\nthat war could be avoided. In this situation, the Turks have declared\r\nwar against the Russians. This, I think, renders a general war\r\ninevitable. Perhaps the European powers may take this winter to\r\ndetermine which side each shall take. There is a possibility that an\r\nalliance between France and the two empires may induce England and\r\nPrussia to tread back their steps. In that case, the Patriotic party in\r\nHolland will be peaceably placed at the head of their government. The\r\nTurks will be driven out of Europe, their continental possessions\r\ndivided between Russia and the Emperor, and perhaps their islands and\r\nEgypt allotted to France. These events seem possible at present. * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 18, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--Congress having thought proper, by their vote of July the\r\n18th, to entrust me to take measures for the redemption of our captives\r\nat Algiers, and to desire you to furnish the money necessary, it is\r\nproper to state to you some data whereby you may judge what sum is\r\nnecessary. The French prisoners, last redeemed by the order of\r\nMathurins, cost somewhat less than four hundred dollars: but the\r\nGeneral of the order told me, that they had always been made to pay\r\nmore for foreign prisoners than their own. The smallest sum then, at\r\nwhich we can expect ours, including redemption, clothing, feeding, and\r\ntransportation, will be five hundred dollars each. There are twenty of\r\nthem. Of course, ten thousand dollars is the smallest sum which can be\r\nrequisite. I think a larger sum should be set apart, as so much of it\r\nas shall not be wanting for the prisoners, will remain for other uses.\r\nAs soon as you shall have notified me that the money is ready, I will\r\nproceed to execute the order of Congress. I must add the injunctions of\r\nthe General of the Mathurins, that it be not made known that the public\r\ninterest themselves in the redemption of these prisoners, as that would\r\ninduce the Algerians to demand the most extravagant price. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with sentiments of the most profound respect, Gentlemen,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 19, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last letters to you were of the 6th and 15th of August; since\r\nwhich, I have been honored with yours of July the 24th, acknowledging\r\nthe receipt of mine of the 14th and 23d of February. I am anxious to\r\nhear you have received that also of May the 4th, written from\r\nMarseilles. According to the desires of Congress, expressed in their\r\nvote confirming the appointments of Francisco, Giuseppa and Girolamo\r\nChiappi, their agents in Morocco, I have written letters to these\r\ngentlemen, to begin a correspondence with them. To the first, I have\r\ninclosed the ratification of the treaty with the Emperor of Morocco,\r\nand shall send it either by our agent at Marseilles, who is now here,\r\nor by the Count Daranda, who sets out for Madrid in a few days, having\r\nrelinquished his embassy here. I shall proceed on the redemption of our\r\ncaptives at Algiers, as soon as the commissioners of the treasury shall\r\nenable me, by placing the money necessary, under my orders. The\r\nprisoners redeemed by the religious order of Mathurins, cost about four\r\nhundred dollars each, and the General of the order told me, that they\r\nhad never been able to redeem foreigners on so good terms as their own\r\ncountrymen. Supposing that their redemption, clothing, feeding and\r\ntransportation, should amount to five hundred dollars each, there must\r\nbe, at least, a sum of ten thousand dollars set apart for this purpose.\r\nTill this is done, I shall take no other step than the preparatory one,\r\nof destroying at Algiers all idea of our intending to redeem the\r\nprisoners. This, the General of the Mathurins told me, was\r\nindispensably necessary, and that it must not, on any account,\r\ntranspire, that the public would interest themselves for their\r\nredemption. This was rendered the more necessary, by the declaration of\r\nthe Dey to the Spanish consul, that he should hold him responsible, at\r\nthe Spanish price, for our prisoners, even for such as should die.\r\nThree of them have died of the plague. By authorizing me to redeem at\r\nthe prices _usually_ paid by the European nations, Congress, I suppose,\r\ncould not mean the Spanish price, which is not only unusual, but\r\nunprecedented, and would make our vessels the first object with those\r\npirates. I shall pay no attention, therefore, to the Spanish price,\r\nunless further instructed. Hard as it may seem, I should think it\r\nnecessary not to let it be known even to the relations of the captives,\r\nthat we mean to redeem them.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you a paper from the admiralty of\r\nGuadaloupe, sent to me as a matter of form, and to be lodged, I\r\nsuppose, with our marine records. I enclose, also, a copy of a letter\r\nfrom the Count de Florida Blanca to Mr. Carmichael, by which you will\r\nperceive, they have referred the settlement of the claim of South\r\nCarolina for the use of their frigate, to Mr. Gardoqui, and to the\r\nDelegates of South Carolina in Congress.\r\n\r\nI had the honor to inform you, in my last letter, of the parliament's\r\nbeing transferred to Troyes. To put an end to the tumults in Paris,\r\nsome regiments were brought nearer, the patroles were strengthened and\r\nmultiplied, some mutineers punished by imprisonment: it produced the\r\ndesired effect. It is confidently believed, however, that the\r\nparliament will be immediately recalled, the stamp tax and land tax\r\nrepealed, and other means devised of accommodating their receipts and\r\nexpenditures. Those supposed to be in contemplation, are a rigorous\r\nlevy of the old tax of the _deux vingtiemes_, on the rich, who had, in\r\na great measure, withdrawn their property from it, as well as on the\r\npoor, on whom it had principally fallen. This will greatly increase the\r\nreceipts; while they are proceeding on the other hand, to reform their\r\nexpenses far beyond what they had promised. It is said these\r\nreformations will amount to eighty millions. Circumstances render these\r\nmeasures more and more pressing. I mentioned to you in my last letter,\r\nthat the officer charged by the ministry to watch the motion of the\r\nBritish squadron, had returned with information that it had sailed\r\nwestwardly. The fact was not true. He had formed his conclusion too\r\nhastily, and thus led the ministry into error. The King of Prussia,\r\nurged on by England, has pressed more and more the affairs of Holland,\r\nand lately has given to the States General of Holland, four days only\r\nto comply with his demand. This measure would, of itself, have rendered\r\nit impossible for France to proceed longer in the line of accommodation\r\nwith Prussia. In the same moment, an event takes place, which seems to\r\nrender all attempt at accommodation idle. The Turks have declared war\r\nagainst the Russians, and that under circumstances which exclude all\r\nprospect of preventing its taking place. The King of Prussia having\r\ndeserted his ancient friends, there remains only France and Turkey,\r\nperhaps Spain also, to oppose the two empires, Russia and England. By\r\nsuch a piece of Quixotism, France might plunge herself into ruin with\r\nthe Turks and Dutch, but would save neither. But there is certainly a\r\nconfederacy secretly in contemplation, of which the public have not yet\r\nthe smallest suspicion; that is, between France and the two empires. I\r\nthink it sure that Russia has desired this, and that the Emperor, after\r\nsome hesitation, has acceded. It rests on this country to close. Her\r\nindignation against the King of Prussia will be some spur. She will\r\nthereby save her party in Holland, and only abandon the Turks to that\r\nfate she cannot ward off, and which their precipitation has brought on\r\nthemselves, by the instigations of the English ambassador at the Porte,\r\nand against the remonstrances of the French ambassador. Perhaps this\r\nformidable combination, should it take place, may prevent the war of\r\nthe western powers, as it would seem that neither England nor Prussia\r\nwould carry their false calculations so far, as, with the aid of the\r\nTurks only, to oppose themselves to such a force. In that case, the\r\nPatriots of Holland would be peaceably established in the powers of\r\ntheir government, and the war go on against the Turks only, who would\r\nprobably be driven from Europe. This new arrangement would be a total\r\nchange of the European system, and a favorable one for our friends. The\r\nprobability of a general war, in which this country will be engaged on\r\none side, and England on the other, has appeared to me sufficient to\r\njustify my writing to our agents in the different ports of France, to\r\nput our merchants on their guard, against risking their property in\r\nFrench or English bottoms. The Emperor, instead of tracing back his\r\nsteps in Brabant, as was expected, has pursued the less honorable plan\r\nof decoying his subjects thence by false pretences, to let themselves\r\nbe invested by his troops, and this done, he dictates to them his own\r\nterms. Yet it is not certain the matter will end with that.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Moustier is nominated Minister Plenipotentiary to America;\r\nand a frigate is ordered to Cherbourg, to carry him over. He will\r\nendeavor to sail by the middle of the next month, but if any delay\r\nshould make him pass over the whole of October, he will defer his\r\nvoyage to the spring, being unwilling to take a winter passage.\r\nMonsieur de St. Priest is sent Ambassador to Holland, in the room of\r\nMonsieur de Verac, appointed to Switzerland. The Chevalier de Luzerne\r\nmight, I believe, have gone to Holland, but he preferred a general\r\npromise of promotion, and the possibility that it might be to the court\r\nof London. His prospects are very fair. His brother, the Count de la\r\nLuzerne, (now Governor in the West Indies,) is appointed minister of\r\nthe marine, in the place of Monsieur de Castries, who has resigned. The\r\nArchbishop of Thoulouse is appointed _ministre principale_, and his\r\nbrother, Monsieur de Brienne, minister of war, in the place of Monsieur\r\nde Segur. The department of the Comptroller has had a very rapid\r\nsuccession of tenants. From Monsieur de Calonnes it passed to Monsieur\r\nde Forqueux, from him to Villedeuil, and from him to Lambert, who holds\r\nit at present, but divided with a Monsieur Cabarrus, (whom I believe\r\nyou knew in Spain,) who is named _Directeur du tresor_ _royal_, the\r\noffice into which M. Neckar came at first. I had the honor to inform\r\nyou, that before the departure of the Count de Luzerne to his\r\ngovernment in the West Indies, I had pressed on him the patronage of\r\nour trade with the French islands; that he appeared well disposed, and\r\nassured me he would favor us as much as his instructions, and the laws\r\nof the colonies, would permit. I am in hopes these dispositions will be\r\nstrengthened by his residence in the islands, and that his acquaintance\r\namong the people there, will be an additional motive to favor them.\r\nProbably they will take advantage of his appointment, to press\r\nindulgences in commerce with us. The ministry is of a liberal\r\ncomplexion, and well disposed to us. The war may add to the motives for\r\nopening their islands to other resources for their subsistence, and for\r\ndoing what may be agreeable to us. It seems to me, at present, then,\r\nthat the moment of the arrival of the Count de La Luzerne, will be the\r\nmoment for trying to obtain a freer access to their islands. It would\r\nbe very material to do this, if possible, in a permanent way, that is\r\nto say, by treaty. But I know of nothing we have to offer in\r\nequivalent. Perhaps the payment of our debt to them might be made use\r\nof as some inducement, while they are so distressed for money. Yet the\r\nborrowing the money in Holland will be rendered more difficult by the\r\nsame event, in proportion as it will increase the demand for money by\r\nother powers.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of Leyden and France to this date are enclosed, together\r\nwith some pamphlets on the internal affairs of this country.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMPSON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Sept. 20, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of April the 28th did not come to my hands till\r\nthe first instant. Unfortunately, the box of plants, which were a day\r\ntoo late to come by the April packet, missed the packet of June the\r\n10th also, and only came by that of July the 25th. They are not yet\r\narrived at Paris, but I expect them daily. I am sensible of your kind\r\nattention to them, and that as you were leaving New York, you took the\r\ncourse which bade fair to be the best. That they were forgotten in the\r\nhands in which you placed them, was probably owing to too much\r\nbusiness, and more important. I have desired Mr. Madison to refund to\r\nyou the money you were so kind as to advance for me. The delay of your\r\nletter will apologize for this delay of the repayment. I thank you also\r\nfor the extract of the letter you were so kind as to communicate to me,\r\non the antiquities found in the western country. I wish that the\r\npersons who go thither would make very exact descriptions of what they\r\nsee of that kind, without forming any theories. The moment a person\r\nforms a theory, his imagination sees, in every object, only the traits\r\nwhich favor that theory. But it is too early to form theories on those\r\nantiquities. We must wait with patience till more facts are collected.\r\nI wish your Philosophical Society would collect exact descriptions of\r\nthe several monuments as yet known, and insert them naked in their\r\nTransactions, and continue their attention to those hereafter to be\r\ndiscovered. Patience and observation may enable us in time, to solve\r\nthe problem, whether those who formed the scattering monuments in our\r\nwestern country, were colonies sent off from Mexico, or the founders of\r\nMexico itself? Whether both were the descendants or the progenitors of\r\nthe Asiatic red men? The Mexican tradition, mentioned by Dr. Robertson,\r\nis an evidence, but a feeble one, in favor of the one opinion. The\r\nnumber of languages radically different, is a strong evidence in favor\r\nof the contrary one. There is an American by the name of Ledyard, he\r\nwho was with Captain Cook on his last voyage, and wrote an account of\r\nthat voyage, who has gone to St. Petersburg; from thence he was to go\r\nto Kamschatka; to cross over thence to the northwest coast of America,\r\nand to penetrate through the main continent, to our side of it. He is a\r\nperson of ingenuity and information. Unfortunately, he has too much\r\nimagination. However, if he escapes safety, he will give us new,\r\ncurious and useful information. I had a letter from him, dated last\r\nMarch, when he was about to leave St. Petersburg on his way to\r\nKamschatka.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the inclination of the strata of rocks, I had observed\r\nthem between the Blue Ridge and North Mountains in Virginia, to be\r\nparallel with the pole of the earth. I observed the same thing in most\r\ninstances in the Alps, between Cette and Turin; but in returning along\r\nthe precipices of the Apennines, where they hang over the\r\nMediterranean, their direction was totally different and various; and\r\nyou mention that in our western country they are horizontal. This\r\nvariety proves they have not been formed by subsidence, as some writers\r\nof theories of the earth have pretended; for then they should always\r\nhave been in circular strata, and concentric. It proves, too, that they\r\nhave not been formed by the rotation of the earth on its axis, as might\r\nhave been suspected, had all these strata been parallel with that axis.\r\nThey may, indeed, have been thrown up by explosions, as Whitehurst\r\nsupposes, or have been the effect of convulsions. But there can be no\r\nproof of the explosion, nor is it probable that convulsions have\r\ndeformed every spot of the earth. It is now generally agreed that rock\r\ngrows, and it seems that it grows in layers in every direction, as the\r\nbranches of trees grow in all directions. Why seek further the solution\r\nof this phenomenon? Everything in nature decays. If it were not\r\nreproduced then by growth, there would be a chasm.\r\n\r\nI remember you asked me, in a former letter, whether the steam mill in\r\nLondon was turned by the steam immediately, or by the intermediate\r\nagency of water raised by the steam. When I was in London, Boulton made\r\na secret of his mill. Therefore, I was permitted to see it only\r\nsuperficially. I saw no water wheels, and, therefore, supposed none. I\r\nanswered you, accordingly, that there were none. But when I was at\r\nNismes, I went to see the steam mill there, and they showed it to me in\r\nall the parts. I saw that their steam raised water, and that this water\r\nturned a wheel. I expressed my doubts of the necessity of the\r\ninter-agency of water, and that the London mill was without it. But\r\nthey supposed me mistaken; perhaps I was so; I have had no opportunity\r\nsince of clearing up the doubt.\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nI had a letter from Mr. Churchman, but not developing his plan of\r\nknowing the longitude, fully. I wrote him what was doubted about it, so\r\nfar as we could conjecture what it was.\r\n\r\nI am, with very great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Sept. 22, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--The letters of which the enclosed are copies, are this moment\r\nreceived, and as there is a possibility that they may reach Havre\r\nbefore the packet sails, I have the honor of enclosing them to you.\r\nThey contain a promise of reducing the duties on tar, pitch and\r\nturpentine, and that the government will interest itself with the city\r\nof Rouen, to reduce the local duty on potash. By this you will perceive\r\nthat we are getting on a little in this business, though under their\r\npresent embarrassments, it is difficult to procure the attention of the\r\nministers to it. The parliament has enregistered the edict of a\r\nrigorous levy of the _deux vingtiemes_. As this was proposed by the\r\nKing in lieu of the impost territorial, there is no doubt now that the\r\nlatter, with the stamp tax, will be immediately repealed. There can be\r\nno better proof of the revolution in the public opinion, as to the\r\npowers of the monarch, and of the force, too, of that opinion. Six\r\nweeks ago, we saw the King displaying the plentitude of his\r\nomnipotence, as hitherto conceived, to enforce these two acts. At this\r\nday, he is forced to retract them by the public voice; for as to the\r\nopposition of the parliament, that body is too little esteemed to\r\nproduce this effect in any case where the public do not throw\r\nthemselves into the same scale.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Sept. 22, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--When I had the honor of addressing you this morning, intelligence\r\nwas handing about, which I did not think well enough authenticated to\r\ncommunicate to you. As it is now ascertained, I avail myself of the\r\nchance that another post may yet reach Havre before the departure of\r\nthe packet. This will depend on the wind, which has for some days been\r\nunfavorable. I must premise, that this court, about ten days ago,\r\ndeclared, by their Charge des Affaires in Holland, that if the Prussian\r\ntroops continued to menace Holland with an invasion, his Majesty was\r\ndetermined, in quality of ally, to succor that province. An _official_\r\nletter from the Hague, of the 18th instant, assures that the Prussian\r\narmy entered the territory of Holland on the 15th, that most of the\r\nprincipal towns had submitted, some after firing a gun or two, others\r\nwithout resistance; that the Rhingrave de Salm had evacuated Utretcht,\r\nwith part of the troops under his command, leaving behind him one\r\nhundred and forty-four pieces of cannon, with great warlike stores;\r\nthat the standard of Orange was hoisted everywhere; that no other\r\ncockade could be worn at the Hague; that the States General were to\r\nassemble that night for reinstating the Stadtholder in all his rights.\r\nThe letter concludes, \"we have this moment intelligence that Woerden\r\nhas capitulated; so that Amsterdam remains without defence.\" So far the\r\nletter. We know, otherwise, that Monsieur de St. Priest, who had set\r\nout on his embassy to the Hague, has stopped at Antwerp, not choosing\r\nto proceed further till new orders. This court has been completely\r\ndeceived, first by its own great desire to avoid a war, and secondly by\r\ncalculating that the King of Prussia would have acted on principles of\r\ncommon sense, which would surely have dictated, that a power, lying\r\nbetween the jaws of Russia and Austria, should not separate itself from\r\nFrance, unless, indeed, he had assurances of dispositions in those two\r\npowers, which are not supposed to exist. On the contrary, I am\r\npersuaded that they ask the alliance of France, whom we suppose to be\r\nunder hesitations between her reluctance to abandon the Turks, her\r\njealousy of increasing by their spoils, the power of the two empires,\r\nand the inability to oppose them. If they cannot obtain her alliance,\r\nthey will surely join themselves to England and Prussia.\r\n\r\nOfficial advices are received, that the first division of the Russian\r\narmy has passed the Borysthenes into the Polish Ukraine, and is\r\nmarching towards the frontiers of Turkey. Thus, we may consider the\r\nflames of war as completely kindled in two distinct parts of this\r\nquarter of the globe, and that though France and England have not yet\r\nengaged themselves in it, the probabilities are, that they will do it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARNES.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 22, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am honored by your favor of the 17th instant. A war between\r\nFrance and England does not necessarily engage America in it; and I\r\nthink she will be disposed rather to avail herself of the advantages of\r\na neutral power. By the former usage of nations, the goods of a friend\r\nwere safe, though taken in an enemy bottom, and those of an enemy were\r\nlawful prize, though found in a free bottom. But in our treaties with\r\nFrance, etc., we have established the simpler rule, that a free bottom\r\nmakes free goods, and an enemy bottom, enemy goods. The same rule has\r\nbeen adopted by the treaty of armed neutrality between Russia, Sweden,\r\nDenmark, Holland and Portugal, and assented to by France and Spain.\r\nContraband goods, however, are always excepted, so that they may still\r\nbe seized; but the same powers have established that naval stores are\r\nnot contraband; and this may be considered now as the law of nations.\r\nThough England acquiesced under this during the late war, rather than\r\ndraw on herself the neutral powers, yet she never acceded to the new\r\nprinciple, and her obstinacy on this point, is what has prevented the\r\nlate renewal of her treaty with Russia. On the commencement of a new\r\nwar, this principle will probably be insisted on by the neutral powers,\r\nwhom we may suppose to be Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, America, and\r\nperhaps Spain. Quere; if England will again acquiesce. Supposing these\r\ndetails might be useful to you, I have taken the liberty of giving\r\nthem, and of assuring you of the esteem with which I am, Sir, your very\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LIMOZIN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 22, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I must trouble you with another letter to Mr. Jay, to be\r\ndelivered to Monsieur Bourgoin on board the packet, which I hope will\r\nnot be sailed before it gets to your hands, as the letter is of extreme\r\nimportance. It is to inform Congress that official advice is just\r\nreceived here that the Prussian troops entered the territory of Holland\r\non the 15th instant; that most of the principal towns had submitted,\r\nthat Utrecht was evacuated by the Rhingrave de Salm, and Woerden\r\ncapitulated, so that Amsterdam remained without defence. M. de St.\r\nPriest had stopped at Antwerp and waited further orders. We know also,\r\nthat the first division of the Russian army has passed the Borysthenes\r\ninto the Polish Ukraine, and is marching towards the frontiers of\r\nTurkey. War then is well kindled in those two quarters. Monsieur\r\nCabarus is arrived at Paris, but will not accept the appointment\r\noffered him unless they will adopt his plans. On this there is\r\nhesitation; so that it is not certain he will come in.\r\n\r\nI have received your favor of the 20th, and shall make proper use of\r\nits contents. Should the packet be sailed, I will pray you to send my\r\nletter by the first of the vessels which you mention bound for\r\nPhiladelphia. I am, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 24, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--The times are now so critical, that every day brings something\r\nnew and important, not known the day before. Observing the wind still\r\nunfavorable, I am in hopes the packet may not sail to-morrow, and that\r\nthis letter may be at Havre in time for that conveyance. Mr. Eden has\r\nwaited on Count Montmorin to inform him, officially, that England must\r\nconsider its convention with France, relative to the giving notice of\r\nits naval armament, as at an end, and that they are arming generally.\r\nThis is considered here as a declaration of war. The Dutch ambassador\r\ntold me yesterday, that he supposed the Prussian troops probably in\r\npossession of the Hague. I asked him if it would interrupt the course\r\nof business, commercial or banking, in Amsterdam; and particularly,\r\nwhether our depot of money there was safe. He said, the people of\r\nAmsterdam would be surely so wise as to submit, when they should see\r\nthat they could not oppose the Stadtholder; therefore he supposed our\r\ndepot safe, and that there would be no interruption of business. It is\r\nthe hour of the departure of the post; so I have only time to add\r\nassurances of the respect and esteem with which I have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 28, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your favor by Mr. Cutting, and thank you\r\nsincerely for the copy of your book. The departure of a packet boat,\r\nwhich always gives me full employment for some time before, has only\r\npermitted me to look into it a little. I judge of it from the first\r\nvolume, which I thought formed to do a great deal of good. The first\r\nprinciple of a good government, is certainly, a distribution of its\r\npowers into executive, judiciary and legislative, and a subdivision of\r\nthe latter into two or three branches. It is a good step gained, when\r\nit is proved that the English constitution, acknowledged to be better\r\nthan all which have preceded it, is only better in proportion as it has\r\napproached nearer to this distribution of powers. From this, the last\r\nstep is easy, to show by a comparison of our constitutions with that of\r\nEngland, how much more perfect they are. The article of Confederations\r\nis certainly worthy of your pen. It would form a most interesting\r\naddition, to show, what have been the nature of the Confederations\r\nwhich have existed hitherto, what were their excellences, and what\r\ntheir defects. A comparison of ours with them would be to the advantage\r\nof ours, and would increase the veneration of our countrymen for it. It\r\nis a misfortune that they do not sufficiently know the value of their\r\nconstitutions, and how much happier they are rendered by them, than any\r\nother people on earth, by the governments under which they live.\r\n\r\nYou know all that has happened in the United Netherlands. You know also\r\nthat our friends, Van Staphorsts, will be among the most likely to\r\nbecome objects of severity, if any severities should be exercised. Is\r\nthe money in their hands entirely safe? If it is not, I am sure you\r\nhave already thought of it. Are we to suppose the game already up, and\r\nthat the Stadtholder is to be re-established, perhaps erected into a\r\nmonarch, without the country lifting a finger in opposition to it. If\r\nso, it is a lesson the more for us. In fact, what a crowd of lessons do\r\nthe present miseries of Holland teach us? Never to have an hereditary\r\nofficer of any sort: never to let a citizen ally himself with kings:\r\nnever to call in foreign nations to settle domestic differences: never\r\nto suppose that any nation will expose itself to war for us, etc. Still\r\nI am not without hopes that a good rod is in soak for Prussia, and that\r\nEngland will feel the end of it. It is known to some, that Russia made\r\npropositions to the Emperor and France, for acting in concert; that the\r\nEmperor consents, and has disposed four camps of one hundred and eighty\r\nthousand men, from the limits of Turkey to those of Prussia. This court\r\nhesitates, or rather its Premier hesitates; for the Queen, Montmorin\r\nand Breteuil, are for the measure. Should it take place, all may yet\r\ncome to rights, except for the Turks, who must retire from Europe, and\r\nthis they must do, were France Quixotic enough to undertake to support\r\nthem. We, I hope, shall be left free to avail ourselves of the\r\nadvantages of neutrality; and yet, much I fear, the English, or rather\r\ntheir stupid King, will force us out of it. For thus I reason. By\r\nforcing us into the war against them, they will be engaged in an\r\nexpensive land war, as well as a sea war. Common sense dictates,\r\ntherefore, that they should let us remain neuter: _ergo_ they will not\r\nlet us remain neuter. I never yet found any other general rule for\r\nforetelling what they will do, but that of examining what they ought\r\nnot to do.\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with my best respects to Mrs. Adams, and\r\nsentiments of perfect esteem and regard to yourself, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL SMITH.\r\n\r\nPARIS, September 28, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your favor by Mr. Cutting. I had before\r\nhad a transient acquaintance with him, and knew him to be sensible.\r\nYour recommendation is always a new merit. I really think, and had\r\ntaken the liberty some time ago of hinting to Congress, that they would\r\ndo well to have a diplomatic character at Lisbon. There is no country\r\nwhose commerce is more interesting to us. I wish Congress would\r\ncorrespond to the wishes of that court, in sending a person there, and\r\nto mine, in sending yourself. For I confess, I had rather see you there\r\nthan at London, because I doubt whether it be honorable for us to keep\r\nanybody at London, unless they keep some person at New York. Of all\r\nnations on earth, they require to be treated with the most hauteur.\r\nThey require to be kicked into common good manners. You ask, if you\r\nshall say anything to Sullivan about the bill. No. Only that it is\r\npaid. I have within these two or three days, received letters from him\r\nexplaining the matter. It was really for the skin and bones of the\r\nmoose, as I had conjectured. It was my fault, that I had not given him\r\na rough idea of the expense I would be willing to incur for them. He\r\nhad made the acquisition an object of a regular campaign, and that too\r\nof a winter one. The troops he employed sallied forth, as he writes me,\r\nin the month of March--much snow--a herd attacked--one killed--in the\r\nwilderness--a road to cut twenty miles--to be drawn by hand from the\r\nfrontiers to his house--bones to be cleaned, etc., etc., etc. In fine,\r\nhe puts himself to an infinitude of trouble, more than I meant: he did\r\nit cheerfully, and I feel myself really under obligations to him. That\r\nthe tragedy might not want a proper catastrophe, the box, bones, and\r\nall, are lost; so that this chapter of Natural History will still\r\nremain a blank. But I have written to him not to send me another. I\r\nwill leave it for my successor to fill up, whenever I shall make my bow\r\nhere. The purchase for Mrs. Adams shall be made, and sent by Mr.\r\nCutting. I shall always be happy to receive her commands. Petit shall\r\nbe made happy by her praises of his last purchase for her. I must refer\r\nyou to Mr. Adams for the news. Those respecting the Dutch you know as\r\nwell as I. Nor should they be written but with the pen of Jeremiah.\r\nAdieu mon ami! Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE BUFFON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 3, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had-the honor of informing you, some time ago, that I had\r\nwritten to some of my friends in America, desiring they would send me\r\nsuch of the spoils of the moose, caribou, elk and deer, as might throw\r\nlight on that class of animals; but more particularly, to send me the\r\ncomplete skeleton, skin and horns of the moose, in such condition as\r\nthat the skin might be sewed up and stuffed, on its arrival here. I am\r\nhappy to be able to present to you at this moment, the bones and skin\r\nof a moose, the horns of another individual of the same species, the\r\nhorns of the caribou, the elk, the deer, the spiked horned buck, and\r\nthe roebuck of America. They all come from New Hampshire and\r\nMassachusetts and were received by me yesterday. I give you their\r\npopular names, as it rests with yourself to decide their real names.\r\nThe skin of the moose was dressed with the hair on, but a great deal of\r\nit has come off, and the rest is ready to drop off. The horns of the\r\nelk are remarkably small. I have certainly seen some of them which\r\nwould have weighed five or six times as much. This is the animal which\r\nwe call elk in the southern parts of America, and of which I have given\r\nsome description in the Notes on Virginia, of which I had the honor of\r\npresenting you a copy. I really doubt whether the flat-horned elk\r\nexists in America; and I think this may be properly classed with the\r\nelk, the principal difference being in the horns. I have seen the daim,\r\nthe cerf, the chevreuil of Europe. But the animal we call elk, and\r\nwhich may be distinguished as the round-horned elk, is very different\r\nfrom them. I have never seen the brand-hirtz or cerf d'Ardennes, nor\r\nthe European elk. Could I get a sight of them, I think I should be able\r\nto say which of them the American elk resembles most, as I am tolerably\r\nwell acquainted with that animal. I must observe also, that the horns\r\nof the deer, which accompany these spoils, are not of the fifth or\r\nsixth part of the weight of some that I have seen. This individual has\r\nbeen of three years of age, according to our method of judging. I have\r\ntaken measures, particularly, to be furnished with large horns of our\r\nelk and our deer, and therefore beg of you not to consider those now\r\nsent, as furnishing a specimen of their ordinary size. I really suspect\r\nyou will find that the moose, the round-horned elk, and the American\r\ndeer, are species not existing in Europe. The moose is, perhaps, of a\r\nnew class. I wish these spoils, Sir, may have the merit of adding\r\nanything new to the treasures of nature, which have so fortunately come\r\nunder your observation, and of which she seems to have given you the\r\nkey: they will in that case be some gratification to you, which it will\r\nalways be pleasing to me to have procured; having the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. C. W. F. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 4, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received your favor of the 23d of September, two days ago. That\r\nof the 28th and 29th, was put in my hands this morning. I immediately\r\nwaited on the ambassadors, ordinary and extraordinary, of the United\r\nNetherlands, and also on the envoy of Prussia, and asked their good\r\noffices to have an efficacious protection extended to your person, your\r\nfamily, and your effects, observing that the United States know no\r\nparty, but are the friends and allies of the United Netherlands as a\r\nnation, and would expect from their friendship, that the person who is\r\ncharged with their affairs until the arrival of a Minister, should be\r\ncovered from all insult and injury which might be offered him by a\r\nlawless mob; well assured that their Minister residing with Congress,\r\nwould, on all occasions, receive the same. They have been so good as to\r\npromise me, each, that he will in his first despatches press this\r\nmatter on the proper power, and give me reason to hope that it will be\r\nefficacious for your safety. I will transmit your letter to Mr. Jay by\r\nthe Count de Moustier, who sets out within a week for New York, as\r\nMinister Plenipotentiary for France, in that country. I sincerely\r\nsympathize in your sufferings, and wish that what I have done may\r\neffect an end to them, being with much respect and esteem, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 5, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have now before me your several favors of April the 16th, 26th,\r\nand 30th, and of May the 9th and 29th, and received also a few days ago\r\nthe box containing the skin, bones, and horns of the moose, and other\r\nanimals, which your Excellency has been so kind as to take so much\r\ntrouble to obtain and forward. They were all in good enough condition,\r\nexcept that a good deal of the hair of the moose had fallen off.\r\nHowever, there remained still enough to give a good idea of the animal,\r\nand I am in hopes Monsieur de Buffon will be able to have him stuffed,\r\nand placed on his legs in the King's Cabinet. He was in the country\r\nwhen I sent the box to the Cabinet, so that I have as yet no answer\r\nfrom him. I am persuaded he will find the moose to be a different\r\nanimal from any he had described in his work. I am equally persuaded\r\nthat our elk and deer are animals of a different species from any\r\nexisting in Europe. Unluckily, the horns of them now received are\r\nremarkably small. However, I have taken measures to procure some from\r\nVirginia. The moose is really a valuable acquisition; but the skeletons\r\nof the other animals would not be worth the expense they would occasion\r\nto me, and still less the trouble to you. Of this, you have been\r\nalready so kind as to take a great deal more than I intended to have\r\ngiven you, and I beg you to accept my sincere thanks. Should a pair of\r\nlarge horns of the elk or deer fall into your way by accident, I would\r\nthank you to keep them till some vessel should be coming directly from\r\nyour nearest port to Havre. So also of very large horns of the moose,\r\nfor I understand they are sometimes enormously large indeed. But I\r\nwould ask these things only on condition they should occasion you no\r\ntrouble, and me little expense.\r\n\r\nYou will have known that war is commenced between the Turks and\r\nRussians, and that the Prussian troops have entered Holland, and\r\nreinstated the Stadtholder. It is said that even Amsterdam has\r\ncapitulated. Yet is it possible, and rather probable, this country will\r\nengage in a war to restore the Patriots. If they do, it will be the\r\nmost general one long known in Europe. We, I hope, shall enjoy the\r\nblessings of a neutrality, and probably see England once more humbled.\r\nI am, with great esteem and respect, your Excellency's most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 8, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of writing you on the 19th of September, twice on\r\nthe 22d, and again on the 24th. The two first went by the packet, the\r\nthird by a vessel bound to Philadelphia. I have not yet learned by what\r\noccasion the last went. In these several letters, I communicated to you\r\nthe occurrences of Europe, as far as they were then known.\r\nNotwithstanding the advantage which the Emperor seemed to have gained\r\nover his subjects of Brabant, by the military arrangements he had been\r\npermitted to make under false pretexts, he has not obtained his ends.\r\nHe certainly wished to enforce his new regulations; but he wished more\r\nto be cleared of all domestic difficulties, that he might be free to\r\nact in the great scenes which are preparing for the theatre of Europe.\r\nHe seems, therefore to have instructed his Governor General of the\r\nNetherlands to insist on compliance as far as could be insisted,\r\nwithout producing resistance by arms; but, at the same time, to have\r\nfurnished him with a sufficiently complete recantation, to prevent the\r\neffects of insurrection. The Governor pressed; the people were firm; a\r\nsmall act of force was then attempted, which produced a decided\r\nresistance, in which the people killed several of the military: the\r\nlast resource was then used, which was the act of recantation; this\r\nproduced immediate tranquillity, and everything there is now finally\r\nsettled, by the Emperor's relinquishment of his plans.\r\n\r\nMy letter of the evening of September the 22d, informed you that the\r\nPrussian troops had entered Holland, and that of the 24th that England\r\nhad announced to this court that she was arming generally. These two\r\nevents being simultaneous, proved that the two sovereigns acted in\r\nconcert. Immediately after, the court of London announced to the other\r\ncourts of Europe, that if France entered Holland with armed force, she\r\nwould consider it as an act of hostility, and declare war against her;\r\nsending Mr. Granville here at the same, to make what she called a\r\nconciliatory proposition. This proposition was received as a new\r\ninsult, Mr. Granville very coolly treated, and he has now gone back. It\r\nis said, he has carried the ultimatum of France. What it is,\r\nparticularly, has not transpired; it is only supposed, in general, to\r\nbe very firm. You will see in one of the Leyden gazettes, one of the\r\nletters written by the ministers of England to the courts of their\r\nrespective residence, communicating the declaration before mentioned.\r\nIn the meantime, Holland has been sooner reduced by the Prussian troops\r\nthan could have been expected. The abandonment of Utrecht by the\r\nRhingrave of Salm, seems to have thrown the people under a general\r\npanic, during which every place submitted, except Amsterdam. That had\r\nopened conferences with the Duke of Brunswick; but as late as the\r\nsecond instant, no capitulation was yet concluded. The King of Prussia,\r\non his first move, demanded categorically of the King of Poland, what\r\npart he intended to act in the event of war. The latter answered, he\r\nshould act as events should dictate; and is, in consequence of this\r\nspecies of menace from Prussia, arming himself. He can bring into the\r\nfield almost seventy thousand good cavalry. In the meantime, though\r\nnothing transpires publicly of the confederation between France and the\r\ntwo empires, mentioned in my letter of September the 19th, it is not\r\nthe less sure that it is on the carpet, and will take place. To the\r\ncircumstances before mentioned may be added, as further indications of\r\nwar, the naming as Generalissimo of their marine on the Atlantic,\r\nMonsieur de Suffrein, on the Mediterranean, Monsieur Albert de Rioms,\r\nthe recalling Monsieur de St. Priest, their Ambassador, from Antwerp,\r\nbefore he had reached the Hague, and the activity of their armies by\r\nsea. On the other hand, the little movement by land would make one\r\nsuppose they expected to put the King of Prussia into other hands.\r\nThey, too, like the Emperor, are arranging matters at home. The\r\nrigorous levy of the _deux vingtiemes_ is enregistered, the stamp act\r\nand impost territorial are revoked, the parliament recalled, the nation\r\nsoothed by these acts, and inspired by the insults of the British\r\ncourt. The part of the Council still leaning towards peace, are become\r\nunpopular, and perhaps may feel the effects of it. No change in the\r\nadministration has taken place since my last, unless we may consider as\r\nsuch, Monsieur Cabarrus's refusal to stand in the lines. Thinking he\r\nshould be forced to follow, too seriously, plans formed by others, he\r\nhas declined serving.\r\n\r\nShould this war take place, as is quite probable, and should it be as\r\ngeneral as it threatens to be, our neutrality must be attended with\r\ngreat advantages. Whether of a nature to improve our morals or our\r\nhappiness, is another question. But is it sure, that Great Britain, by\r\nher searches, her seizures, and other measures for harassing us, will\r\npermit us to preserve our neutrality? I know it may be argued, that the\r\nland war which she would superadd to her sea war, by provoking us to\r\njoin her enemies, should rationally hold her to her good behavior with\r\nus. But since the accession of the present monarch, has it not been\r\npassion, and not reason which, nine times out of ten, has dictated her\r\nmeasures? Has there been a better rule of prognosticating what he would\r\ndo, than to examine what he ought not to do? When I review his\r\ndispositions, and review his conduct, I have little hope of his\r\npermitting our neutrality. He will find subjects of provocation in\r\nvarious articles of our treaty with France, which will now come into\r\nview, in all their consequences, and in consequences very advantageous\r\nto the one, and injurious to the other country. I suggest these doubts,\r\non a supposition that our magazines are not prepared for war, and in\r\nthe opinion that provisions for that event should be thought of.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter from Mr. Dumas came to me open, though directed to\r\nyou. I immediately waited on the ambassadors, ordinary and\r\nextraordinary, of Holland, and the envoy of Prussia, and prayed them to\r\ninterest themselves to have his person, his family and his goods\r\nprotected. They promised me readily to do it, and have written\r\naccordingly; I trust it will be with effect. I could not avoid\r\nenclosing you the letter from Monsieur Bouebe, though I have satisfied\r\nhim he is to expect nothing from Congress for his inventions. These are\r\nbetter certified than most of those things are; but if time stamps\r\ntheir worth, time will give them to us. He expects no further answer.\r\nThe gazettes of Leyden and France to this date accompany this, which\r\nwill be delivered you by the Count de Moustier, Plenipotentiary from\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 8, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The bearer hereof, the Count de Moustier, successor to\r\nMonsieur de La Luzerne, would, from his office, need no letter of\r\nintroduction to you or to anybody. Yet I take the liberty of\r\nrecommending him to you, to shorten those formal approaches, which the\r\nsame office would otherwise expose him to, in making your acquaintance.\r\nHe is a great enemy to formality, etiquette, ostentation and luxury. He\r\ngoes with the best dispositions to cultivate society, without poisoning\r\nit by ill example. He is sensible, disposed to view things favorably,\r\nand being well acquainted with the constitution of England, her manners\r\nand language, is the better prepared for his station with us. But I\r\nshould have performed only the lesser, and least pleasing half of my\r\ntask, were I not to add my recommendations of Madame de Brehan. She is\r\ngoodness itself. You must be well acquainted with her. You will find\r\nher well disposed to meet your acquaintance, and well worthy of it. The\r\nway to please her, is to receive her as an acquaintance of a thousand\r\nyears standing. She speaks little English. You must teach her more, and\r\nlearn French from her. She hopes, by accompanying Monsieur de Moustier,\r\nto improve her health, which is very feeble, and still more, to improve\r\nher son in his education, and to remove him to a distance from the\r\nseductions of this country. You will wonder to be told, that there are\r\nno schools in this country to be compared to ours, in the sciences. The\r\nhusband of Madame de Brehan is an officer, and obliged by the times to\r\nremain with the army. Monsieur de Moustier brings your watch. I have\r\nworn it two months, and really find it a most incomparable one. It will\r\nnot want the little redressing which new watches generally do, after\r\ngoing about a year. It costs six hundred livres. To open it in all its\r\nparts, press the little pin on the edge, with the point of your nail;\r\nthat opens the crystal; then open the dial-plate in the usual way; then\r\npress the stem, at the end within the loop, and it opens the back for\r\nwinding up or regulating.\r\n\r\nDe Moustier is remarkably communicative. With adroitness he may be\r\npumped of anything. His openness is from character, not from\r\naffectation. An intimacy with him may, on this account, be politically\r\nvaluable. I am, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n(Private.) PARIS, October 8, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The Count de Moustier, Minister Plenipotentiary from the\r\nCourt of Versailles to the United States, will have the honor of\r\ndelivering you this. The connection of your offices will necessarily\r\nconnect you in acquaintance; but I beg leave to present him to you, on\r\naccount of his personal as well as his public character. You will find\r\nhim open, communicative, candid, simple in his manners, and a declared\r\nenemy to ostentation and luxury. He goes with a resolution to add no\r\naliment to it by his example, unless he finds that the dispositions of\r\nour countrymen require it indispensably. Permit me, at the same time,\r\nto solicit your friendly notice, and through you, that also of Mrs.\r\nJay, to Madame la Marquise de Brehan, sister-in-law to Monsieur de\r\nMoustier. She accompanies him, in hopes that a change of climate may\r\nassist her feeble health, and also, that she may procure a more\r\nvaluable education for her son, and safer from seduction, in America\r\nthan in France. I think it impossible to find a better woman, more\r\namiable, more modest, more simple in her manners, dress, and way of\r\nthinking. She will deserve the friendship of Mrs. Jay, and the way to\r\nobtain hers, is to receive her and treat her without the shadow of\r\netiquette.\r\n\r\nThe Count d'Aranda leaves us in a day or two. He desired me to recall\r\nhim to your recollection, and to assure you of his friendship. In a\r\nletter which I mean as a private one, I may venture details too minute\r\nfor a public one, yet not unamusing, or unsatisfactory. I may venture\r\nnames, too, without the danger of their getting into a newspaper. There\r\nhas long been a division in the Council here, on the question of war\r\nand peace. Monsieur de Montmorin and Monsieur de Breteuil have been\r\nconstantly for war. They are supported in this by the Queen. The King\r\ngoes for nothing. He hunts one half the day, is drunk the other, and\r\nsigns whatever he is bid. The Archbishop of Thoulouse desires peace.\r\nThough brought in by the Queen, he is opposed to her in this capital\r\nobject, which would produce an alliance with her brother. Whether the\r\nArchbishop will yield or not, I know not. But an intrigue is already\r\nbegun for ousting him from his place, and it is rather probable it will\r\nsucceed. He is a good and patriotic minister for peace, and very\r\ncapable in the department of finance. At least, he is so in theory. I\r\nhave heard his talents for execution censured. Can I be useful here to\r\nMrs. Jay or yourself, in executing any commissions, great or small? I\r\noffer you my services with great cordiality. You know whether any of\r\nthe wines in this country may attract your wishes. In my tour, last\r\nspring, I visited the best vineyards of Burgundy, Cote-rotie,\r\nHermitage, Lunelle, Frontignan, and white and red Bordeaux, got\r\nacquainted with the proprietors, and can procure for you the best crops\r\nfrom the vigneron himself. Mrs. Jay knows if there is anything else\r\nhere, in which I could be useful to her. Command me without ceremony,\r\nas it will give me real pleasure to serve you, and be assured of the\r\nsincere attachment and friendship, with which I am, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE MOUSTIER.\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson has the honor of presenting his respects to Monsieur le\r\nComte de Moustier, and of taking leave of him by letter, which he is\r\nprevented doing in person, by an unexpected visit to Versailles to-day.\r\nHe will hope to have the pleasure of sometimes hearing from him, and\r\nwill take the liberty occasionally, of troubling him with a letter. He\r\nconsiders the Count de Moustier as forming, with himself, the two end\r\nlinks of that chain which holds the two nations together, and is happy\r\nto have observed in him dispositions to strengthen rather than to\r\nweaken it. It is a station of importance, as on the cherishing good\r\ndispositions and quieting bad ones, will depend, in some degree, the\r\nhappiness and prosperity of the two countries. The Count de Moustier\r\nwill find the affections of the Americans with France, but their habits\r\nwith England. Chained to that country by circumstances, embracing what\r\nthey loathe, they realize the fable of the living and the dead bound\r\ntogether. Mr. Jefferson troubles the Count de Moustier with two\r\nletters, to gentlemen whom he wishes to recommend to his particular\r\nacquaintance, and to that of Madame de Brehan. He bids Monsieur de\r\nMoustier a most friendly adieu, and wishes him everything which may\r\nrender agreeable his passage across the water, and his residence beyond\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE BREHAN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersuaded, Madam, that visits at this moment must be troublesome, I beg\r\nyou to accept my adieus in this form. Be assured, that no one mingles\r\nwith them more regret at separating from you. I will ask your\r\npermission to enquire of you by letter sometimes, how our country\r\nagrees with your health and your expectations, and will hope to hear it\r\nfrom yourself. The imitation of European manners, which you will find\r\nin our towns, will, I fear, be little pleasing. I beseech you to\r\npractice still your own, which will furnish them a model of what is\r\nperfect. Should you be singular, it will be by excellence, and after\r\nawhile you will see the effect of your example.\r\n\r\nHeaven bless you, Madam, and guard you under all circumstances; give\r\nyou smooth waters, gentle breezes, and clear skies, hushing all its\r\nelements into peace, and leading with its own hand the favored bark,\r\ntill it shall have safely landed its precious charge on the shores of\r\nour new world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LIMOZIN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor with my account balance 160_l._\r\n7_s._, which shall be paid to your order. I observe it is supposed with\r\nyou that the differences between the courts of London and St. Cloud are\r\nnearly settled. But be assured on the contrary, that no accommodation\r\nis expected, and that war is as certain as it can be, without being\r\nactually commenced or declared. There remains, indeed, a possibility of\r\npreventing it, but it is very feeble. This court would be disposed to\r\ndo it, but they believe that of London decided on war. We cannot\r\nforesee the moment it will commence, but it is not distant, according\r\nto present appearances. M. de Suffrein is appointed to command on the\r\nOcean, and M. Albert de Rion on the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. C. W. F. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 14, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favors of October the 23d and 26th.\r\nWith respect to the mission you suggest in the former, no powers are\r\nlodged in the hands of Mr. Adams and myself. Congress commissioned Mr.\r\nAdams, Dr. Franklin and myself, to treat with the Emperor on the\r\nsubject of amity and commerce; at the same time, they gave us the\r\ncommission to Prussia, with which you are acquainted. We proposed\r\ntreating through the Imperial Ambassador here. It was declined on their\r\npart, and our powers expired, having been given but for two years.\r\nAfterwards, the same Ambassador here was instructed to offer to treat\r\nwith us. I informed him our powers were expired, but that I would write\r\nto Congress on the subject. I did so, but have never yet received an\r\nanswer. Whether this proceeds from a change of opinion in them, or from\r\nthe multiplicity of their occupations, I am unable to say; but this\r\nstate of facts will enable you to see that we have no powers in this\r\ninstance, to take the measures you had thought of. I sincerely\r\nsympathise with you in your sufferings. Though forbidden by my\r\ncharacter, to meddle in the internal affairs of an allied State, it is\r\nthe wish of my heart that their troubles may have such an issue, as\r\nwill secure the greatest degree of happiness to the body of the people;\r\nfor it is with the mass of the nation we are allied, and not merely\r\nwith their governors. To inform the minds of the people, and to follow\r\ntheir will, is the chief duty of those placed at their head. What party\r\nin your late struggles was most likely to do this, you are more\r\ncompetent to judge than I am. Under every event, that you may be safe\r\nand happy, is the sincere wish of him, who has the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE CORNY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 18, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now have the honor, Madam, to send you the Memoire of M. de Calonnes.\r\nDo not injure yourself by hurrying its perusal. Only, when you shall\r\nhave read it at your ease, be so good as to send it back, that it may\r\nbe returned to the Duke of Dorset. You will read it with pleasure. It\r\nhas carried comfort to my heart, because it must do the same to the\r\nKing and the nation. Though it does not prove M. de Calonnes to be more\r\ninnocent than his predecessors, it shows him not to have been that\r\nexaggerated scoundrel, which the calculations and the clamors of the\r\npublic have supposed. It shows that the public treasures have not been\r\nso inconceivably squandered, as the parliaments of Grenoble, Thoulouse,\r\netc., had affirmed. In fine, it shows him less wicked, and France less\r\nbadly governed, than I had feared. In examining my little collection of\r\nbooks, to see what it could furnish you on the subject of Poland; I\r\nfind a small piece which may serve as a supplement to the history I had\r\nsent you. It contains a mixture of history and politics, which I think\r\nyou will like.\r\n\r\nHow do you do this morning? I have feared you exerted and exposed\r\nyourself too much yesterday. I ask you the question, though I shall not\r\nawait its answer. The sky is clearing, and I shall away to my\r\nhermitage. God bless you, my dear Madam, now and always. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, October 23, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I take the liberty of troubling your Excellency on the subject of\r\nthe _Arret_ which has lately appeared, for prohibiting the importation\r\nof whale oils and spermaceti, the produce of foreign fisheries. This\r\nprohibition being expressed in general terms, seems to exclude the\r\nwhale oils of the United States of America, as well as of the nations\r\nof Europe. The uniform disposition, however, which his Majesty and his\r\nministers have shown to promote the commerce between France and the\r\nUnited States, by encouraging our productions to come hither, and\r\nparticularly those of our fisheries, induces me to hope, that these\r\nwere not within their view, at the passing of this _Arret_. I am led\r\nthe more into this opinion, when I recollect the assiduity exercised\r\nfor several months, in the year 1785, by the committee appointed by\r\ngovernment to investigate the objects of commerce of the two countries,\r\nand to report the encouragements of which it was susceptible; the\r\nresult of that investigation, which his Majesty's Comptroller General\r\ndid me the honor to communicate, in a letter of the 22d of October,\r\n1786, stating therein the principles which should be established for\r\nthe future regulations of that commerce, and particularly\r\ndistinguishing the articles of whale oils by an abatement of the duties\r\nof them for the present, and a promise of further abatement after the\r\nyear 1790; the thorough re-investigation with which Monsieur de Lambert\r\nhonored this subject, when the letter of 1786 was to be put into the\r\nform of an _Arret_; that _Arret_ itself, bearing date the 29th of\r\nDecember last, which ultimately confirmed the abatements of duty\r\npresent and future, and declared that his Majesty reserved to himself\r\nto grant other favors to that production, if on further information, he\r\nshould find it for the interest of the two nations; and finally, the\r\nletter in which Monsieur de Lambert did me the honor to enclose the\r\n_Arret_, and to assure me, that the duties which had been levied on our\r\nwhale oils, contrary to the intention of the letter of 1786, should be\r\nrestored. On a review, then, of all these circumstances, I cannot but\r\npresume, that it has not been intended to reverse, in a moment, views\r\nso maturely digested, and uniformly pursued; and that the general\r\nexpressions of the _Arret_ of September the 28th had within their\r\ncontemplation the nations of Europe only. This presumption is further\r\nstrengthened by having observed, that in the treaties of commerce, made\r\nsince the epoch of our independence, the _jura gentis amicissimae_\r\nconceded to other nations, are expressly restrained to those of the\r\n\"most favored _European_ nation;\" his Majesty wisely foreseeing, that\r\nit would be expedient to regulate the commerce of a nation, which\r\nbrings nothing but raw materials to employ the industry of his\r\nsubjects, very differently from that of the European nations, who bring\r\nmostly what has already passed through all the stages of manufacture.\r\n\r\nOn these circumstances, I take the liberty of asking information from\r\nyour Excellency, as to the extent of the late _Arret_; and if I have\r\nnot been mistaken in supposing it did not mean to abridge that of\r\nDecember the 29th, I would solicit an explanatory _Arret_, to prevent\r\nthe misconstructions of it, which will otherwise take place. It is much\r\nto be desired, too, that this explanation could be given as soon as\r\npossible, in order that it may be handed out with the _Arret_ of\r\nSeptember the 28th. Great alarm may otherwise spread among the\r\nmerchants and adventurers in the fisheries, who, confiding in the\r\nstability of regulations, which his Majesty's wisdom had so long and\r\nwell matured, have embarked their fortunes in speculations in this\r\nbranch of business.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the subject to one of the principal members of our\r\nUnion induces me to attend with great anxiety, the re-assurance from\r\nyour Excellency, that no change has taken place in his Majesty's views\r\non this subject; and that his dispositions to multiply, rather than\r\ndiminish the combinations of interest between the two people, continue\r\nunaltered.\r\n\r\nCommerce is slow in changing its channel. That between this country and\r\nthe United States, is as yet but beginning; and this beginning has\r\nreceived some checks. The _Arret_ in question would be a considerable\r\none, without the explanation I have the honor to ask. I am persuaded,\r\nthat a continuation of the dispositions which have been hitherto\r\nmanifested towards us, will insure effects, political and commercial,\r\nof value to both nations.\r\n\r\nI have had too many proofs of the friendly interest your Excellency is\r\npleased to take, in whatever may strengthen the bands and connect the\r\nviews of the two countries, to doubt your patronage of the present\r\napplication; or to pretermit any occasion of repeating assurances of\r\nthose sentiments of high respect and esteem with which I have the honor\r\nto be, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR L'ABBE DE MORELLET.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Oct. 24, 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I wish it were in my power to announce to the Count de Cambrai\r\nthat the Treasury Board of the United States had enabled their banker\r\nhere to answer the demands of the foreign officers. But it is not. As\r\nsoon as I knew that there was a deficiency of money to pay the interest\r\nof this demand I informed the Treasury Board of it. They answered me\r\nthey would supply the necessary fund as soon as it should be in their\r\npower; and I am persuaded they have not failed in inclination to do it.\r\nOf this I had the honor to notify the Count de Cambrai the last year.\r\nIt is not unknown to you that the pursuit of our new machine of\r\ngovernment which works the worst, is that which respects the raising\r\nmoney; and it is that which has occasioned the late attempts to amend\r\nour confederation. Foreseeing that our Treasury Board might not be able\r\nto remit money from America, I suggested to Congress the expediency of\r\nborrowing money in Holland to pay off the foreign officers. And in the\r\nmonth of July last, being assured they could command the money in\r\nHolland, I pressed a more particular proposition to this purpose. As I\r\ndo not foresee any possible objection to the proposition I made them, I\r\nthink myself sure of their acceding to it, and that I may receive news\r\nof it in the month of December. I may be disappointed as to the time of\r\nreceiving their answer, because the course of their business is slow;\r\nbut I do not apprehend it will be much retarded, and still less that\r\nthey will refuse it altogether. The moment I receive an answer, the\r\nCount de Cambrai may be assured it shall be communicated to him. In\r\ndoing this I shall gratify not only my personal friendship for him, but\r\nalso those sentiments of particular esteem and attachment with which I\r\nhave the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Oct. 27, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--When I had the honor of addressing you on the 8th instant, the\r\nappearances of war were such, that no one would have been surprised to\r\nhear that hostilities were actually commenced at sea. The preparations\r\nwere pushed with such vivacity on the part of England, that it was\r\nbelieved she had other objects in view than those she spoke out.\r\nHowever, having protected by her countenance the establishment of the\r\nStadtholder by the Prussian troops, and completely detached the Court\r\nof Berlin from that of Versailles, she made a proposition to the latter\r\nto disarm, which was agreed to. Mutual declarations for this purpose\r\nwere signed last night at Versailles, of which I have now the honor to\r\nenclose you copies.\r\n\r\nCommissaries are to be appointed on each side to see that the disarming\r\ntakes place. The Count de Moustier having been detained at Brest a\r\nfortnight by contrary wind, and this continuing obstinately in the same\r\npoint, admits a possibility that this letter may yet reach Brest before\r\nhis departure. It passes through the post office and will be opened and\r\nread of course. I shall have the honor of addressing you more fully a\r\nweek hence by a private hand. I have now that of assuring you of the\r\nsincerity of that esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, November 3, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last letters to you were of the 8th and 27th of October. In\r\nthe former, I mentioned to you the declaration of this country, that\r\nthey would interpose with force, if the Prussian troops entered\r\nHolland; the entry of those troops into Holland; the declaration of\r\nEngland, that if France did oppose force, they would consider it as an\r\nact of war; the naval armaments on both sides; the nomination of the\r\nBailli de Suffrein as Generalissimo on the ocean; and the cold\r\nreception of Mr. Granville here, with his conciliatory propositions, as\r\nso many symptoms which seemed to indicate a certain and immediate\r\nrupture. It was indeed universally and hourly expected. But the King of\r\nPrussia, a little before these last events, got wind of the alliance on\r\nthe carpet between France and the two empires; he awaked to the\r\nsituation in which that would place him; he made some applications to\r\nthe court of St. Petersburg, to divert the Empress from the proposed\r\nalliance, and supplicated the court of London not to abandon him. That\r\ncourt had also received a hint of the same project; both seemed to\r\nsuspect, for the first time, that it would be possible for France to\r\nabandon the Turks, and that they were likely to get more than they had\r\nplayed for at Constantinople, for they had meant nothing more there,\r\nthan to divert the Empress and Emperor from the affairs of the west, by\r\nemploying them in the east, and at the same time, to embroil them with\r\nFrance as the patroness of the Turks. The court of London engaged not\r\nto abandon Prussia: but both of them relaxed a little the tone of their\r\nproceedings. The King of Prussia sent a Mr. Alvensleben here expressly\r\nto explain and soothe: the King of England, notwithstanding the cold\r\nreception of his propositions by Granville, renewed conferences here\r\nthrough Eden and the Duke of Dorset. The Minister, in the affection of\r\nhis heart for peace, readily joined in conference, and a declaration\r\nand counter-declaration were cooked up at Versailles, and sent to\r\nLondon for approbation. They were approved, arrived here at one o'clock\r\nthe 27th, were signed that night at Versailles, and on the next day, I\r\nhad the honor of enclosing them to you, under cover to the Count de\r\nMoustier, whom I supposed still at Brest, dating my letter as of the\r\n27th, by mistake for the 28th. Lest, however, these papers should not\r\nhave got to Brest before the departure of the Count de Moustier, I now\r\nenclose you other copies. The English declaration states a notification\r\nof this court, in September, by Barthelemy, their Minister at London,\r\n\"that they would send succours into Holland,\" as the first cause of\r\nEngland's arming; desires an explanation of the intentions of this\r\ncourt, as to the affairs of Holland, and proposes to disarm; on\r\ncondition, however, that the King of France shall not retain any\r\nhostile views in any quarter, for what has been done in Holland. This\r\nlast phrase was to secure Prussia, according to promise. The King of\r\nFrance acknowledges the notification by his Minister at London,\r\npromises he will do nothing in consequence of it, declares he has no\r\nintention to intermeddle with force in the affairs of Holland, and that\r\nhe will entertain hostile views in no quarter, for what has been done\r\nthere. He disavows having ever had any intention to interpose with\r\nforce in the affairs of that republic. This disavowal begins the\r\nsentence, which acknowledges he had notified the contrary to the court\r\nof London, and it includes no apology to soothe the feelings which may\r\nbe excited in the breasts of the Patriots of Holland, at hearing the\r\nKing declare he never did intend to aid them with force, when promises\r\nto do this were the basis of those very attempts to better their\r\nconstitution, which have ended in its ruin, as well as their own.\r\n\r\nI have analyzed these declarations, because, being somewhat wrapped up\r\nin their expressions, their full import might escape, on a transient\r\nreading; and it is necessary it should not escape. It conveys to us the\r\nimportant lesson, that no circumstances of morality, honor, interest,\r\nor engagement, are sufficient to authorize a secure reliance on any\r\nnation, at all times, and in all positions. A moment of difficulty, or\r\na moment of error, may render forever useless the most friendly\r\ndispositions in the King, in the major part of his ministers, and the\r\nwhole of his nation. The present pacification is considered by most as\r\nonly a short truce. They calculate on the spirit of the nation, and not\r\non the agued hand which guides its movements. It is certain, that from\r\nthis moment the whole system of Europe changes. Instead of counting\r\ntogether England, Austria, and Russia, as heretofore, against France,\r\nSpain, Holland, Prussia, and Turkey, the division will probably be,\r\nEngland, Holland, and Prussia, against France, Austria, Russia, and\r\nperhaps Spain. This last power is not sure, because the dispositions of\r\nits heir apparent are not sure. But whether the present be truce or\r\npeace, it will allow time to mature the conditions of the alliance\r\nbetween France and the two empires, always supposed to be on the\r\ncarpet. It is thought to be obstructed by the avidity of the Emperor,\r\nwho would swallow a good part of Turkey, Silesia, Bavaria, and the\r\nrights of the Germanic body. To the two or three first articles, France\r\nmight consent, receiving in gratification a well-rounded portion of the\r\nAustrian Netherlands, with the islands of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, and\r\nperhaps lower Egypt. But all this is in embryo, uncertainty known, and\r\ncounterworked by the machinations of the courts of London and Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe following solution of the British armaments is supposed in a letter\r\nof the 25th ultimo, from Colonel Blachden of Connecticut, now at\r\nDunkirk, to the Marquis de La Fayette. I will cite it in his own\r\nwords:--\"A gentleman who left London two days ago, and came to this\r\nplace to-day, informs me that it is now generally supposed that Mr.\r\nPitt's great secret, which has puzzled the whole nation so long, and to\r\naccomplish which design the whole force of the nation is armed, is to\r\nmake a vigorous effort for the recovery of America. When I recollect\r\nthe delay they have made in delivering the forts in America, and that\r\nlittle more than a year ago, one of the British ministry wrote to the\r\nKing a letter, in which were these remarkable words, 'if your Majesty\r\npleases, America may yet be yours;' add to this, if it were possible\r\nfor the present ministry in England to effect such a matter, they would\r\nsecure their places and their power for a long time, and should they\r\nfail in the end, they would be certain of holding them during the\r\nattempt, which it is in their power to prolong as much as they please,\r\nand, at all events, they would boast of having endeavored the recovery\r\nof what a former ministry had abandoned--it is possible.\" A similar\r\nsurmise has come in a letter from a person in Rotterdam to one at this\r\nplace. I am satisfied that the King of England believes the mass of our\r\npeople to be tired of their independence, and desirous of returning\r\nunder his government; and that the same opinion prevails in the\r\nministry and nation. They have hired their news writers to repeat this\r\nlie in their gazettes so long, that they have become the dupes of it\r\nthemselves. But there is no occasion to recur to this, in order to\r\naccount for their arming. A more rational purpose avowed, that purpose\r\nexecuted, and when executed, a solemn agreement to disarm, seem to\r\nleave no doubt that the re-establishment of the Stadtholder was their\r\nobject. Yet it is possible, that having found that this court will not\r\nmake war in this moment for any ally, new views may arise, and they may\r\nthink the moment favorable for executing any purposes they may have, in\r\nour quarter. Add to this, that reason is of no aid in calculating their\r\nmovements. We are, therefore, never safe till our magazines are filled\r\nwith arms. The present season of truce or peace, should, in my opinion,\r\nbe improved without a moment's respite, to effect this essential\r\nobject, and no means be omitted, by which money may be obtained for the\r\npurpose. I say this, however, with due deference to the opinion of\r\nCongress, who are better judges of the necessity and practicability of\r\nthe measure.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to you, in a former letter, the application I had made to\r\nthe Dutch ambassadors and Prussian envoy, for the protection of Mr.\r\nDumas. The latter soon after received an assurance, that he was put\r\nunder the protection of the States of Holland; and the Dutch Ambassador\r\ncalled on me a few days ago, to inform me, by instruction from his\r\nconstituents, \"that the States General had received a written\r\napplication from Mr. Adams, praying their protection of Dumas; that\r\nthey had instructed their _greffier_, Fagel, to assure Mr. Adams, by\r\nletter, that he was under the protection of the States of Holland; but\r\nto inform him, at the same time, that Mr. Dumas' conduct, out of the\r\nline of his office, had been so extraordinary, that they would expect\r\n_de l'honnetete_ de Mr. Adams, that he would charge some other person\r\nwith the affairs of the United States, during his absence.\"\r\n\r\nYour letter of September the 8th, has been duly received. I shall pay\r\ndue attention to the instructions relative to the medals, and give any\r\naid I can in the case of Boss' vessel. As yet, however, my endeavors to\r\nfind Monsieur Pauly, _avocat au conseil d'etat, rue Coquilliere_, have\r\nbeen ineffectual. There is no such person living in that street. I\r\nfound a Monsieur Pauly, _avocat au parlement_, in another part of the\r\ntown; he opened the letter, but said it could not mean him. I shall\r\nadvertise in the public papers. If that fails, there will be no other\r\nchance of finding him. Mr. Warnum will do well, therefore, to send some\r\nother description by which the person may be found. Indeed, some friend\r\nof the party interested should be engaged to follow up this business,\r\nas it will require constant attention, and probably a much larger sum\r\nof money than that named in the bill enclosed in Mr. Warnum's letter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you a letter from O'Bryan to me, containing\r\ninformation from Algiers, and one from Mr. Montgomery, at Alicant. The\r\npurpose of sending you this last, is to show you how much the\r\ndifficulties of ransom are increased since the Spanish negotiations.\r\nThe Russian captives have cost about eight thousand livres apiece, on\r\nan average. I certainly have no idea that we should give any such sum;\r\nand, therefore, if it should be the sense of Congress to give such a\r\nprice, I would be glad to know it by instruction. My idea is, that we\r\nshould not ransom, but on the footing of the nation which pays least,\r\nthat it may be as little worth their while to go in pursuit of us, as\r\nany nation. This is cruelty to the individuals now in captivity, but\r\nkindness to the hundreds that would soon be so, were we to make it\r\nworth the while of those pirates to go cut of the Straits in quest of\r\nus. As soon as money is provided, I shall put this business into train.\r\nI have taken measures to damp at Algiers all expectations of our\r\nproposing to ransom, at any price. I feel the distress which this must\r\noccasion to our countrymen there, and their connections; but the object\r\nof it is their ultimate good, by bringing down their holders to such a\r\nprice as we ought to pay, instead of letting them remain in such\r\nexpectations as cannot be gratified. The gazettes of France and Leyden\r\naccompany this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n[_The annexed are translations of the declaration and\r\ncounter-declaration, referred to in the preceding letter._]\r\n\r\nDECLARATION.\r\n\r\nThe events which have taken place in the republic of the United\r\nprovinces, appearing no longer to leave any subject of discussion, and\r\nstill less of dispute, between the two courts, the undersigned are\r\nauthorized to ask, if it be the intention of his most Christian Majesty\r\nto act in pursuance of the notification given, on the 16th of last\r\nmonth, by the Minister Plenipotentiary of his most Christian Majesty,\r\nwhich announcing his purpose of aiding Holland, has occasioned maritime\r\narmaments on the part of his Majesty, which armaments have become\r\nreciprocal.\r\n\r\nIf the court of Versailles is disposed to explain itself on this\r\nsubject, and on the conduct adopted towards the republic, in a manner\r\nconformably to the desire evinced by each party, to preserve a good\r\nunderstanding between the two courts, it being also understood, at the\r\nsame time, that no hostile view is entertained in any quarter, in\r\nconsequence of the past; his Majesty, always eager to manifest his\r\nconcurrence in the friendly sentiments of his most Christian Majesty,\r\nagrees forthwith that the armaments, and, in general, all preparations\r\nfor war, shall be mutually discontinued, and that the marines of the\r\ntwo nations shall be placed on the footing of a peace establishment,\r\nsuch as existed on the first of January of the present year.\r\n\r\nSigned. { DORSET.\r\n        { WM.

MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nAt Versailles, the 27th of October, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n(Private.) PARIS, November 3, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I shall take the liberty of confiding sometimes to a private\r\nletter such details of the small history of the court or cabinet, as\r\nmay be worthy of being known, and yet not proper to be publicly\r\ncommunicated. I doubt whether the administration is yet in a permanent\r\nform. The Count de Montmorin and Baron de Breteuil are, I believe, firm\r\nenough in their places. It was doubted whether they would wait for the\r\nCount de La Luzerne, if the war had taken place; but at present, I\r\nsuppose they will. I wish it also, because M. de Hector, his only\r\ncompetitor, has on some occasions shown little value for the connection\r\nwith us. Lambert, the Comptroller General, is thought to be very\r\ninsecure. I should be sorry also to lose him. I have worked several\r\ndays with him, the Marquis de La Fayette, and Monsieur du Pont, (father\r\nof the young gentleman gone to America with the Count de Moustier) to\r\nreduce into one _Arret_, whatever concerned our commerce. I have found\r\nhim a man of great judgment and application, possessing good general\r\nprinciples on subjects of commerce, and friendly dispositions towards\r\nus. He passed the _Arret_ in a very favorable form, but it has been\r\nopposed in the Council, and will, I fear, suffer some alteration in the\r\narticle of whale oil. That of tobacco, which was put into a separate\r\ninstrument, experiences difficulties also, which do not come from him.\r\nM. du Pont has rendered us essential service on these occasions. I wish\r\nhis son could be so well noticed, as to make a favorable report to his\r\nfather; he would, I think, be gratified by it, and his good\r\ndispositions be strengthened, and rendered further useful to us.\r\nWhether I shall be able to send you these regulations by the present\r\npacket, will depend on their getting through the Council in time. The\r\nArchbishop continues well with his patroness. Her object is, a close\r\nconnection with her brother. I suppose he convinces her, that peace\r\nwill furnish the best occasion of cementing that connection.\r\n\r\nIt may not be uninstructive, to give you the origin and nature of his\r\ninfluence with the Queen. When the Duke de Choiseul proposed the\r\nmarriage of the Dauphin with this lady, he thought it proper to send a\r\nperson to Vienna, to perfect her in the language. He asked his friend,\r\nthe Archbishop of Thoulouse, to recommend to him a proper person. He\r\nrecommended a certain Abbe. The Abbe, from his first arrival at Vienna,\r\neither tutored by his patron, or prompted by gratitude, impressed on\r\nthe Queen's mind, the exalted talents and merit of the Archbishop, and\r\ncontinually represented him as the only man fit to be placed at the\r\nhelm of affairs. On his return to Paris, being retained near the person\r\nof the Queen, he kept him constantly in her view. The Archbishop was\r\nnamed of the Assembly des Notables, had occasion enough there to prove\r\nhis talents, and Count de Vergennes, his great enemy, dying\r\nopportunely, the Queen got him into place. He uses the Abbe even yet,\r\nfor instilling all his notions into her mind. That he has imposing\r\ntalents and patriotic dispositions, I think is certain. Good judges\r\nthink him a theorist only, little acquainted with the details of\r\nbusiness, and spoiling all his plans by a bungled execution. He may\r\nperhaps undergo a severe trial. His best actions are exciting against\r\nhim a host of enemies, particularly the reduction of the pensions, and\r\nreforms in other branches of economy. Some think the other ministers\r\nare willing he should stay in, till he has effected this odious, yet\r\nnecessary work, and that they will then make him the scape-goat of the\r\ntransaction. The declarations too, which I send you in my public\r\nletter, if they should become public, will probably raise an universal\r\ncry. It will all fall on him, because Montmorin and Breteuil say,\r\nwithout reserve, that the sacrifice of the Dutch has been against their\r\nadvice. He will, perhaps, not permit these declarations to appear in\r\nthis country. They are absolutely unknown; they were communicated to me\r\nby the Duke of Dorset, and I believe no other copy has been given here.\r\nThey Till be published doubtless in England, as a proof of their\r\ntriumph, and may thence make their way into this country. If the\r\nPremier can stem a few months, he may remain long in office, and will\r\nnever make war if he can help it. If he should be removed, the peace\r\nwill probably be short. He is solely chargeable with the loss of\r\nHolland. True, they could not have raised money by taxes, to supply the\r\nnecessities of war; but could they do it were their finances ever so\r\nwell arranged? No nation makes war now-a-days, but by the aid of loans;\r\nand it is probable, that in a war for the liberties of Holland, all the\r\ntreasures of that country would have been at their service. They have\r\nnow lost the cow which furnishes the milk of war. She will be on the\r\nside of their enemies, whenever a rupture shall take place; and no\r\narrangement of their finances can countervail this circumstance.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt, you permit access to the letters of your foreign\r\nministers, by persons only of the most perfect trust. It is in the\r\nEuropean system, to bribe the clerks high, in order to obtain copies of\r\ninteresting papers. I am sure you are equally attentive to the\r\nconveyance of your letters to us, as you know that all are opened that\r\npass through any post-office of Europe. Your letters which come by the\r\npacket, if put into the mail at New York, or into the post-office at\r\nHavre, wear proofs that they have been opened. The passenger to whom\r\nthey are confided, should be cautioned always to keep them in his own\r\nhands, till he can deliver them personally in Paris.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, November 6, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I take the liberty of asking your Excellency's perusal of the\r\nenclosed case of an American hostage, confined in the prisons of\r\nDunkirk. His continuance seems to be useless, and yet endless. Not\r\nknowing how far the government can interfere for his relief, as it is a\r\ncase wherein private property is concerned, I do not presume to ask his\r\nliberation absolutely; but I will solicit from your Excellency such\r\nmeasures in his behalf, as the laws and usages of the country may\r\npermit.\r\n\r\nThe Comptroller General having been so good as to explain to me in a\r\nconversation that he wished to know what duties were levied in England\r\non American whale oil, I have had the honor of informing him by letter,\r\nthat the ancient duties on that article are seventeen pounds, six\r\nshillings and six pence sterling, the ton, and that some late\r\nadditional duties make them amount to about eighteen pounds sterling.\r\nThat the common whale oil sells there but for about twenty pounds\r\nsterling, the ton, and of course the duty amounts to a prohibition.\r\nThis duty was originally laid on all foreign fish oil, with a view to\r\nfavor the British and American fisheries. When we became independent,\r\nand, of course, foreign to great Britain, we became subject to the\r\nforeign duty. No duty, therefore, which France may think proper to lay\r\non this article, can drive it to the English market. It could only\r\noblige the inhabitants of Nantucket to abandon their fishery. But the\r\npoverty of their soil offering them no other resource, they must quit\r\ntheir country, and either establish themselves in Nova Scotia, where,\r\nas British fishermen, they may participate of the British premium, in\r\naddition to the ordinary price of their whale oil, or they must accept\r\nthe conditions which this government offers, for the establishment they\r\nhave proposed at Dunkirk. Your Excellency will judge, what conditions\r\nmay counterbalance, in their minds, the circumstances of the vicinity\r\nof Nova Scotia, sameness of language, laws, religion, customs and\r\nkindred. Remaining in their native country, to which they are most\r\nsingularly attached, excluded from commerce with England, taught to\r\nlook to France as the only country from which they can derive\r\nsustenance, they will, in case of war, become useful rovers against its\r\nenemies. Their position, their poverty, their courage, their address\r\nand their hatred, will render them formidable scourges on the British\r\ncommerce. It is to be considered then, on the one hand, that the duty\r\nwhich M. de Calonnes had proposed to retain on their oil, may endanger\r\nthe shifting this useful body of seamen out of our joint scale into\r\nthat of the British; and also may suppress a considerable subject of\r\nexchange for the productions of France: on the other hand, that it may\r\nproduce an addition to his Majesty's revenue. What I have thus far\r\nsaid, is on the supposition, that the duty may operate a diminution of\r\nthe price received by the fishermen. If it act in the contrary\r\ndirection, and produce an augmentation of price to the consumer, it\r\nimmediately brings into competition a variety of other oils, vegetable\r\nand animal, a good part of which France receives from abroad, and the\r\nfisherman thus losing his market, is compelled equally to change either\r\nhis calling or country. When M. de Calonnes first agreed to reduce the\r\nduties to what he has declared, I had great hopes the commodity could\r\nbear them, and that it would become a medium of commerce between France\r\nand the United States. I must confess, however, that my expectations\r\nhave not been fulfilled, and that but little has come here as yet. This\r\ninduces me to fear, that it is so poor an article, that any duty\r\nwhatever will suppress it. Should this take place, and the spirit of\r\nemigration once seize those people, perhaps an abolition of all duty\r\nmight then come too late to stop, what it would now easily prevent. I\r\nfear there is danger in the experiment; and it remains for the wisdom\r\nof his Majesty and his ministers to decide, whether the prospect of\r\ngain to the revenue, or establishing a national fishery, may compensate\r\nthis danger. If the Government should decide to retain the duty, I\r\nshall acquiesce in it cheerfully, and do everything in my power to\r\nencourage my countrymen still to continue their occupation.\r\n\r\nThe actual session of our several legislatures would render it\r\ninteresting to forward immediately the regulations proposed on our\r\ncommerce; and the expiration of the order of Bernis, at the close of\r\nthis month, endangers a suspension and derangement in the commerce of\r\ntobacco, very embarrassing to the merchants of the two countries.\r\nPardon me, therefore, Sir, if I appear solicitous to obtain the\r\nultimate decision of his Majesty's Council on these subjects and to ask\r\nas early a communication of that decision, as shall be convenient.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most profound esteem and\r\nrespect, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Jay\r\n Photogravure from the Original Painting by Stuart and Trumbull]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, November 7, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--By a letter of the 2d instant, from the Count de Moustier, I\r\nperceive he is still at Brest. The wind has been now near a month in\r\nthe south-western quarter, and if it remains there a few days longer,\r\nmy despatches by the packet may reach you as soon as those by Monsieur\r\nde Moustier. This being the last post which can reach the packet,\r\nshould she sail on the 10th, I avail myself of it to inform you of the\r\nonly circumstance, since the date of my letters delivered to Mr.\r\nStuart, worth your knowledge; that is the appointment of the Chevalier\r\nde La Luzerne, Ambassador to the Court of London. This fortunate issue\r\nof those expectations which made him unwilling to return to America,\r\ntogether with the character of his successor, will, I hope, render it\r\npleasing to Congress that his return was not too much pressed. He would\r\nhave gone back with dispositions toward us very different from those he\r\nwill carry for us to the Court of London. He has been constantly\r\nsensible that we wished his return, and that we could have procured it,\r\nbut that we did not wish to stand in the way of his promotion. He will\r\nview this as in some measure the effect of our indulgence, and I think\r\nwe may count on his patronage and assistance wherever they may be\r\nuseful to us. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most\r\nperfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, November 13, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--This will be delivered you by young Mr. Rutledge. Your\r\nknowledge of his father will introduce him to your notice. He merits it\r\nmoreover, on his own account.\r\n\r\nI am now to acknowledge your favors of Oct. the 8th and 26th. That of\r\nAug. 25th was duly received, nor can I recollect by what accident I was\r\nprevented from acknowledging it in mine of Sept. the 28th. It has been\r\nthe source of my subsistence hitherto, and must continue to be so, till\r\nI receive letters on the affairs of money from America. Van Staphorsts\r\nand Willinks have answered my drafts. Your books for the Marquis de La\r\nFayette are received here. I will notify it to him, who is at present\r\nwith his Provincial Assembly in Auvergne.\r\n\r\nLittle is said lately of the progress of the negotiations between the\r\ncourts of Petersburg, Vienna and Versailles. The distance of the\r\nformer, and the cautious, unassuming character of its minister here, is\r\none cause of delays: a greater one is, the greediness and unstable\r\ncharacter of the Emperor. Nor do I think that the Principal here will\r\nbe easily induced to lend himself to any connection, which shall\r\nthreaten a war within a considerable number of years. His own reign\r\nwill be that of peace only, in all probability; and were any accident\r\nto tumble him down, this country would immediately gird on its sword\r\nand buckler, and trust to occurrences for supplies of money. The wound\r\ntheir honor has sustained festers in their hearts; and it may be said\r\nwith truth, that the Archbishop, and a few priests determined to\r\nsupport his measures, because, proud to see their order come again into\r\npower, are the only advocates for the line of conduct which has been\r\npursued. It is said and believed through Paris literally, that the\r\nCount de Montmorin, \"_pleuroit comme un enfant_,\" when obliged to sign\r\nthe counter-declaration. Considering the phrase as figurative, I\r\nbelieve it expresses the distress of his heart. Indeed, he has made no\r\nsecret of his individual opinion. In the meantime, the Principal goes\r\non with a firm and patriotic spirit, in reforming the cruel abuses of\r\nthe government, and preparing a new constitution, which will give to\r\nthis people as much liberty as they are capable of managing. This, I\r\nthink, will be the glory of his administration, because, though a good\r\ntheorist in finance, he is thought to execute badly. They are about to\r\nopen a loan of one hundred millions, to supply present wants, and it is\r\nsaid, the preface of the _Arret_ will contain a promise of the\r\nconvocation of the States General, during the ensuing year. Twelve or\r\nfifteen Provincial Assemblies are already in action, and are going on\r\nwell; and I think, that though the nation suffers in reputation, it\r\nwill gain infinitely in happiness, under the present administration. I\r\nenclose to Mr. Jay, a pamphlet which I will beg of you to forward. I\r\nleave it open for your perusal. When you shall have read it, be so good\r\nas to stick a wafer in it. It is not yet published, nor will be for\r\nsome days. This copy has been ceded to me as a favor.\r\n\r\nHow do you like our new constitution? I confess there are things in it\r\nwhich stagger all my dispositions to subscribe to what such an Assembly\r\nhas proposed. The house of federal representatives will not be adequate\r\nto the management of affairs, either foreign or federal. Their\r\nPresident seems a bad edition of a Polish King. He may be elected from\r\nfour years to four years, for life. Reason and experience prove to us,\r\nthat a chief magistrate, so continuable, is an office for life. When\r\none or two generations shall have proved that this is an office for\r\nlife, it becomes, on every occasion, worthy of intrigue, of bribery, of\r\nforce, and even of foreign interference. It will be of great\r\nconsequence to France and England, to have America governed by a\r\nGalloman or Angloman. Once in office, and possessing the military force\r\nof the Union, without the aid or check of a council, he would not be\r\neasily dethroned, even if the people could be induced to withdraw their\r\nvotes from him. I wish that at the end of the four years, they had made\r\nhim forever ineligible a second time. Indeed, I think all the good of\r\nthis new constitution might have been couched in three or four new\r\narticles, to be added to the good, old and venerable fabric, which\r\nshould have been preserved even as a religious relique. Present me and\r\nmy daughters affectionately to Mrs. Adams. The younger one continues to\r\nspeak of her warmly. Accept yourself, assurances of the sincere esteem\r\nand respect with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your friend\r\nand servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I am in negotiation with de La Blancharie. You shall hear from me\r\nwhen arranged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL SMITH.\r\n\r\nPARIS, November 13, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of\r\nOctober the 4th, 8th, and 26th. In the last, you apologize for your\r\nletters of introduction to Americans coming here. It is so far from\r\nneeding apology on your part, that it calls for thanks on mine. I\r\nendeavor to show civilities to all the Americans who come here, and who\r\nwill give me opportunities of doing it; and it is a matter of comfort\r\nto know, from a good quarter, what they are, and how far I may go in my\r\nattentions to them.\r\n\r\nCan you send me Woodmason's bills for the two copying presses for the\r\nMarquis de La Fayette and the Marquis de Chastellux? The latter makes\r\none article in a considerable account, of old standing, and which I\r\ncannot present for want of this article. I do not know whether it is to\r\nyourself or Mr. Adams, I am to give my thanks for the copy of the new\r\nconstitution. I beg leave through you to place them where due. It will\r\nyet be three weeks before I shall receive them from America. There are\r\nvery good articles in it, and very bad. I do not know which\r\npreponderate. What we have lately read, in the history of Holland, in\r\nthe chapter on the Stadtholder, would have sufficed to set me against a\r\nchief magistrate, eligible for a long duration, if I had ever been\r\ndisposed towards one; and what we have always read of the elections of\r\nPolish Kings should have forever excluded the idea of one continuable\r\nfor life. Wonderful is the effect of impudent and persevering lying.\r\nThe British ministry have so long hired their gazetteers to repeat, and\r\nmodel into every form, lies about our being in anarchy, that the world\r\nhas at length believed them, the English nation has believed them, the\r\nministers themselves have come to believe them, and what is more\r\nwonderful, we have believed them ourselves. Yet where does this anarchy\r\nexist? Where did it ever exist, except in the single instance of\r\nMassachusetts? And can history produce an instance of rebellion so\r\nhonorably conducted? I say nothing of its motives. They were founded in\r\nignorance, not wickedness. God forbid we should ever be twenty years\r\nwithout such a rebellion. The people cannot be all, and always, well\r\ninformed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion\r\nto the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet\r\nunder such misconceptions, it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to\r\nthe public liberty. We have had thirteen States independent for eleven\r\nyears. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a\r\ncentury and a half, for each State. What country before, ever existed a\r\ncentury and a half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve\r\nits liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that\r\nthis people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The\r\nremedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What\r\nsignify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must\r\nbe refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\r\nIt is its natural manure. Our convention has been too much impressed by\r\nthe insurrection of Massachusetts; and on the spur of the moment, they\r\nare setting up a kite to keep the hen yard in order. I hope in God,\r\nthis article will be rectified before the new constitution is accepted.\r\nYou ask me if anything transpires here on the subject of South America?\r\nNot a word. I know that there are combustible materials there, and that\r\nthey wait the torch only. But this country probably will join the\r\nextinguishers. The want of facts worth communicating to you, has\r\noccasioned me to give a little loose to dissertation. We must be\r\ncontented to amuse, when we cannot inform.\r\n\r\nPresent my respects to Mrs. Smith, and be assured of the sincere esteem\r\nof, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAMES MAURY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, November 13, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your favor of October 25, the day before\r\nyesterday only. It would be needless for me, therefore, to add to what\r\nyou already know on the subject of peace and war. The principal\r\nminister here is so intent on domestic improvements, and on peace, as\r\nnecessary to give leisure for them, that it will not be his fault, if\r\nit be disturbed again. It will be equally unnecessary for me to give\r\nyou a formal attestation of your being a citizen of the United States.\r\nShould any occasion for it arise hereafter, I shall be always ready to\r\ncertify it. With respect to tobacco, the contract with Mr. Morris and\r\nthe order of Berni cease with this year. I am obtaining an arrangement\r\nfor the five years which yet remain of the present lease to the Farmers\r\nGeneral, by which they will be obliged to take all the tobacco for\r\nwhich they shall have occasion from America, except about one-fifth\r\nnorthern, which they represent as necessary. They will be obliged to\r\ntake only such as comes directly from America, without having touched\r\nat any European port in _French_ or _American_ bottoms, and to make the\r\npurchase in _France_. It will be particularly watched that they\r\npurchase not a single hogshead in England. By this I hope to have\r\ncompletely effected the diverting so much of the tobacco trade as\r\namounts to their own consumption from England to France. I am glad to\r\nfind, also, by your letter, that this operation will have the effect to\r\nraise the price of this commodity at the English market. 24,000\r\nhogsheads of tobacco a year, less at that market than heretofore, must\r\nproduce some change, and it could not be for the worse. The order to\r\nthe farmers will name only 14,000 hogsheads a year, but it is certain\r\nthey must extend it themselves nearly or quite to 24,000, as their\r\nconsumption is near 30,000. I am endeavoring to bring hither also,\r\ndirectly, the rice of America, consumed in this country. At present\r\nthey buy it from London. I am of opinion they could consume the whole\r\nof what is made in America, especially if the rice States will\r\nintroduce the culture of the Piedmont and Egyptian rices also, both of\r\nwhich qualities are demanded here in concurrence with that of Carolina.\r\nI have procured for them the seed from Egypt and Piedmont. The\r\nindulgences given to American whale oil will ensure its coming here\r\ndirectly. In general, I am in hopes to ensure here the transportation\r\nof all our commodities which come to this country in American and\r\nFrench bottoms exclusively, which will countervail the effect of the\r\nBritish navigation act on our carrying business. The returns in French\r\ninstead of English manufactures, will take place by degrees. Supposing\r\nthat these details cannot but be agreeable to you as a merchant and as\r\nan American, I trouble you with them; being with much sincerity, and on\r\nall occasions, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DUMAS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of November 27, showing that mine of November 14, had\r\nnot then got to hand, had given me alarm for its fate, and I had sat\r\ndown to write you a second acknowledgment of the receipt of your two\r\nfavors of October 23 and 26, and to add the receipt, also, of those of\r\nNovember 14, 22 and 27. A copy of my answer of November 14 was prepared\r\nto be enclosed to you, but in that moment came your favors of November\r\n30, December 2d and 4th, by which I perceived that the original had at\r\nlength got safe to hand. By that you have seen all that interference,\r\ndirect or indirect, on the part of Mr. Adams and myself in the business\r\nyou had done me the honor to suggest, would be improper. Your\r\ndespatches for Mr. Jay shall go with mine in the packet of this month.\r\nThese will bring the matter into the view of Congress. In the meantime\r\nI think it would be well to avoid exciting at Brussels or anywhere else\r\nthe least expectation thereon, because it is impossible for us to know\r\nwhat that body may, in its wisdom and with all circumstances under its\r\neye, decide should be done. They had, in the year 1784, made up their\r\nminds as to the system of commercial principles they wished to pursue.\r\nThese were very free. They proposed them to all the powers of Europe.\r\nAll declined except Prussia. To this general opposition they may now\r\nfind it necessary to present a very different general system to which\r\ntheir treaties will form cases of exception, and they may wish to\r\nlessen rather than multiply those cases of exception. Add to this, that\r\nit is in contemplation to change the organization of the federal\r\ngovernment, and they may think it better to leave the system of foreign\r\nconnection to be formed by those who are to pursue it. I only mention\r\nthese as possible considerations, without pretending to know the\r\nsentiments of that honorable body, or any one of its members on the\r\nsubject; and to show that no expectations should be raised which might\r\nembarrass them or embroil ourselves. The proposed change of government\r\nseems to be the proper topic to urge as the reason why Congress may not\r\nat this moment choose to be forming new treaties. Should they choose\r\nit, on the other hand, the reserve of those who act for them, while\r\nuninstructed, cannot do injury.\r\n\r\nI find the expectation very general that the present peace will be of\r\nshort duration. There are circumstances in favor of this opinion, there\r\nare others against it. Certain it is that this country is in a state so\r\nunprepared as to excite astonishment. After the last war, she seems to\r\nhave reposed on her laurels, in confidence that no power would venture\r\nto disturb that repose.\r\n\r\nIt is presumable her present ministry will prepare to vindicate their\r\nnation and their friends. The late events have kindled a fire, which,\r\nthough smothered of necessity for the present moment, will probably\r\nnever be quenched but by signal revenge. Individuals will, in the\r\nmeantime, have incurred sufferings which that may not repair. That\r\nyours may be lessened for the present, and relieved in future, is the\r\nsincere wish of him who has the honor to be, with sentiments of great\r\nesteem and regard, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 11, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am later in acknowledging the receipt of your favors of\r\nOctober the 15th, and November the 5th and 15th, because we have been\r\nlong expecting a packet, which I hoped would bring communications worth\r\ndetailing to you; and she arrived only a few days ago, after a very\r\nlong passage indeed. I am very sorry you have not been able to make out\r\nthe cypher of my letter of September the 25th, because it contained\r\nthings which I wished you to know at that time. They have lost now a\r\npart of their merit; but still, I wish you could decipher them, as\r\nthere remains a part, which it might yet be agreeable to you to\r\nunderstand. I have examined the cypher from which it was written. It is\r\nprecisely a copy of those given to Messrs. Barclay and Lambe. In order\r\nthat you may examine whether yours corresponds, I will now translate\r\ninto cypher the three first lines of my letter of June the 14th.\r\n\r\n[_Here follow three lines of cypher numbers._]\r\n\r\nThis will serve to show whether your cypher corresponds with mine, as\r\nwell as my manner of using it. But I shall not use it in future, till I\r\nknow from you the result of your re-examination of it. I have the honor\r\nnow, to return you the letter you had been so good as to enclose to me.\r\nAbout the same time of Liston's conversation with you, similar ones\r\nwere held with me by Mr. Eden. He particularly questioned me on the\r\neffect of our treaty with France, in the case of a war, and what might\r\nbe our dispositions. I told him without hesitation, that our treaty\r\nobliged us to receive the armed vessels of France, with their prizes,\r\ninto our ports, and to refuse the admission of prizes made on her by\r\nher enemies; that there was a clause by which we guaranteed to France\r\nher American possessions, and which might, perhaps, force us into the\r\nwar, if these were attacked. \"Then it will be war,\" said he, \"for they\r\nwill assuredly be attacked.\" I added, that our dispositions would be to\r\nbe neutral, and that I thought it the interest of both those powers\r\nthat we should be so, because it would relieve both from all anxiety as\r\nto the feeding their West India islands, and England would, moreover,\r\navoid a heavy land war on our continent, which would cripple all her\r\nproceedings elsewhere. He expected these sentiments from me personally,\r\nand he knew them to be analogous to those of our country. We had often\r\nbefore had occasions of knowing each other: his peculiar bitterness\r\ntowards us had sufficiently appeared, and I had never concealed from\r\nhim, that I considered the British as our natural enemies, and as the\r\nonly nation on earth who wished us ill from the bottom of their souls.\r\nAnd I am satisfied, that were our continent to be swallowed up by the\r\nocean, Great Britain would be in a bonfire from one end to the other.\r\nMr. Adams, as you know, has asked his recall. This has been granted,\r\nand Colonel Smith is to return too; Congress having determined to put\r\nan end to their commission at that court. I suspect and hope they will\r\nmake no new appointment.\r\n\r\nOur new Constitution is powerfully attacked in the American newspapers.\r\nThe objections are, that its effect would be to form the thirteen\r\nStates into one; that, proposing to melt all down into one general\r\ngovernment, they have fenced the people by no declaration of rights;\r\nthey have not renounced the power of keeping a standing army; they have\r\nnot secured the liberty of the press; they have reserved the power of\r\nabolishing trials by jury in civil cases; they have proposed that the\r\nlaws of the federal legislatures shall be paramount to the laws and\r\nconstitutions of the States; they have abandoned rotation in office;\r\nand particularly, their President may be re-elected from four years to\r\nfour years, for life, so as to render him a King for life, like a King\r\nof Poland; and they have not given him either the check or aid of a\r\ncouncil. To these they add calculations of expense, etc., etc., to\r\nfrighten the people. You will perceive that these objections are\r\nserious, and some of them not without foundation. The Constitution,\r\nhowever, has been received with a very general enthusiasm, and as far\r\nas can be judged from external demonstrations, the bulk of the people\r\nare eager to adopt it. In the eastern States the printers will print\r\nnothing against it, unless the writer subscribes his name.\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut have called conventions in January, to\r\nconsider of it. In New York, there is a division. The Governor\r\n(Clinton) is known to be hostile to it. Jersey, it is thought, will\r\ncertainly accept it. Pennsylvania is divided; and all the bitterness of\r\nher factions has been kindled anew on it. But the party in favor of it\r\nis strongest, both in and out of the legislature. This is the party\r\nanciently of Morris, Wilson, etc. Delaware will do what Pennsylvania\r\nshall do. Maryland is thought favorable to it; yet it is supposed Chase\r\nand Paca will oppose it. As to Virginia, two of her Delegates, in the\r\nfirst place, refused to sign it. These were Randolph, the Governor and\r\nGeorge Mason. Besides these, Henry, Harrison, Nelson, and the Lees, are\r\nagainst it. General Washington will be for it, but it is not in his\r\ncharacter to exert himself much in the case. Madison will be its main\r\npillar; but though an immensely powerful one, it is questionable\r\nwhether he can bear the weight of such a host. So that the presumption\r\nis, that Virginia will reject it. We know nothing of the dispositions\r\nof the States south of this. Should it fall through, as is possible,\r\nnotwithstanding the enthusiasm with which it was received in the first\r\nmoment, it is probable that Congress will propose, that the objections\r\nwhich the people shall make to it being once known, another convention\r\nshall be assembled, to adopt the improvements generally acceptable, and\r\nomit those found disagreeable. In this way, union may be produced under\r\na happy constitution, and one which shall not be too energetic, as are\r\nthe constitutions of Europe. I give you these details, because,\r\npossibly, you may not have received them all. The sale of our western\r\nlands is immensely successful. Five millions of acres have been sold at\r\nprivate sale, for a dollar an acre, in certificates, and at the public\r\nsales, some of them had sold as high as two dollars and forty cents the\r\nacre. The sales had not been begun two months. By these means, taxes,\r\netc., our domestic debt, originally twenty-eight millions of dollars,\r\nwas reduced, by the 1st day of last October, to twelve millions, and\r\nthey were then in treaty for two millions of acres more, at a dollar,\r\nprivate sale. Our domestic debt will thus be soon paid off, and that\r\ndone, the sales will go on for money, at a cheaper rate, no doubt, for\r\nthe payment of our foreign debt. The _petite guerre_ always waged by\r\nthe Indians, seems not to abate the ardor of purchase or emigration.\r\nKentucky is now counted at sixty thousand. Frankland is also growing\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nI have been told, that the cutting through the Isthmus of Panama, which\r\nthe world has so often wished, and supposed practicable, has at times\r\nbeen thought of by the government of Spain, and that they once\r\nproceeded so far, as to have a survey and examination made of the\r\nground; but that the result was, either impracticability or too great\r\ndifficulty. Probably the Count de Campomanes, or Don Ulloa, can give\r\nyou information on this head. I should be exceedingly pleased to get as\r\nminute details as possible on it, and even copies of the survey,\r\nreport, etc., if they could be obtained at a moderate expense. I take\r\nthe liberty of asking your assistance in this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very great respect and esteem, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 12, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In the month of July, I received from Fiseaux & Co. of\r\nAmsterdam, a letter notifying me that the principal of their loan to\r\nthe United States would become due the first day of January. I answered\r\nthem, that I had neither powers nor information on the subject, but\r\nwould transmit their letter to the board of treasury. I did so, by the\r\npacket which sailed from Havre, August the 10th. The earliest answer\r\npossible, would have been by the packet which arrived at Havre three or\r\nfour days ago. But by her I do not receive the scrip of a pen from\r\nanybody. This makes me suppose, that my letters are committed to Paul\r\nJones, who was to sail a week after the departure of the packet; and\r\nthat possibly, he may be the bearer of orders from the treasury, to\r\nrepay Fiseaux's loan with the money you borrowed But it is also\r\npossible, he may bring no order on the subject. The slowness with which\r\nmeasures are adopted on our side the water, does not permit us to count\r\non punctual answers; but, on the contrary, renders it necessary for us\r\nto suppose, in the present case, that no orders will arrive in time,\r\nand to consider whether anything, and what, should be done? As it may\r\nbe found expedient to transfer all our foreign debts to Holland, by\r\nborrowing there, and as it may always be prudent to preserve a good\r\ncredit in that country, because we may be forced into wars, whether we\r\nwill or not, I should suppose it very imprudent to suffer our credit to\r\nbe annihilated, for so small a sum as fifty-one thousand guilders. The\r\ninjury will be greater, too, in proportion to the smallness of the sum;\r\nfor they will ask, \"How can a people be trusted for large sums, who\r\nbreak their faith for such small ones?\" You know best what effect it\r\nwill have on the minds of the money lenders of that country, should we\r\nfail in this payment. You know best, also, whether it is practicable\r\nand prudent for us, to have this debt paid without orders. I refer the\r\nmatter, therefore, wholly to your consideration, willing to participate\r\nwith you in any risk and any responsibility which may arise. I think it\r\none of those cases, where it is a duty to risk one's self. You will\r\nperceive, by the enclosed, the necessity of an immediate answer, and\r\nthat, if you think anything can and should be done, all the necessary\r\nauthorities from you should accompany your letter. In the meantime,\r\nshould I receive any orders from the treasury by Paul Jones, I will\r\npursue them, and consider whatever you shall have proposed or done, as\r\n_non avenue_.\r\n\r\nI am, with much affection, dear sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 20, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of October the 8th, by the Count de\r\nMoustier. Yours of July the 18th, September the 6th and October the\r\n24th, were successively received, yesterday, the day before, and three\r\nor four days before that. I have only had time to read the letters; the\r\nprinted papers communicated with them, however interesting, being\r\nobliged to lie over till I finish my despatches for the packet, which\r\ndespatches must go from hence the day after to-morrow. I have much to\r\nthank you for; first and most for the cyphered paragraph respecting\r\nmyself. These little informations are very material towards forming my\r\nown decisions. I would be glad even to know, when any individual member\r\nthinks I have gone wrong in any instance. If I know myself, it would\r\nnot excite ill blood in me, while it would assist to guide my conduct,\r\nperhaps to justify it, and to keep me to my duty, alert. I must thank\r\nyou, too, for the information in Thomas Burke's case; though you will\r\nhave found by a subsequent letter, that I have asked of you a further\r\ninvestigation of that matter. It is to gratify the lady who is at the\r\nhead of the convent wherein my daughters are, and who, by her\r\nattachment and attention to them, lays me under great obligations. I\r\nshall hope, therefore, still to receive from you the result of all the\r\nfurther inquiries my second letter had asked. The parcel of rice which\r\nyou informed me had miscarried, accompanied my letter to the Delegates\r\nof South Carolina. Mr. Bourgoin was to be the bearer of both, and both\r\nwere delivered together into the hands of his relation here, who\r\nintroduced him to me, and who, at a subsequent moment, undertook to\r\nconvey them to Mr. Bourgoin. This person was an engraver, particularly\r\nrecommended to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Hopkinson. Perhaps he may have\r\nmislaid the little parcel of rice among his baggage. I am much pleased\r\nthat the sale of western lands is so successful. I hope they will\r\nabsorb all the certificates of our domestic debt speedily, in the first\r\nplace, and that then, offered for cash, they will do the same by our\r\nforeign ones.\r\n\r\nThe season admitting only of operations in the cabinet, and these being\r\nin a great measure secret, I have little to fill a letter. I will,\r\ntherefore, make up the deficiency, by adding a few words on the\r\nConstitution proposed by our convention.\r\n\r\nI like much the general idea of framing a government, which should go\r\non of itself, peaceably, without needing continual recurrence to the\r\nState legislatures. I like the organization of the government into\r\nlegislative, judiciary and executive. I like the power given the\r\nlegislature to levy taxes, and for that reason solely, I approve of the\r\ngreater House being chosen by the people directly. For though I think a\r\nHouse so chosen, will be very far inferior to the present Congress,\r\nwill be very illy qualified to legislate for the Union, for foreign\r\nnations, etc., yet this evil does not weigh against the good, of\r\npreserving inviolate the fundamental principle, that the people are not\r\nto be taxed but by representatives chosen immediately by themselves. I\r\nam captivated by the compromise of the opposite claims of the great and\r\nlittle States, of the latter to equal, and the former to proportional\r\ninfluence. I am much pleased, too, with the substitution of the method\r\nof voting by person, instead of that of voting by States; and I like\r\nthe negative given to the Executive, conjointly with a third of either\r\nHouse; though I should have liked it better, had the judiciary been\r\nassociated for that purpose, or invested separately with a similar\r\npower. There are other good things of less moment. I will now tell you\r\nwhat I do not like. First, the omission of a bill of rights, providing\r\nclearly, and without the aid of sophism, for freedom of religion,\r\nfreedom of the press, protection against standing armies, restriction\r\nof monopolies, the eternal and unremitting force of the habeas corpus\r\nlaws, and trials by jury in all matters of fact triable by the laws of\r\nthe land, and not by the laws of nations. To say, as Mr. Wilson does,\r\nthat a bill of rights was not necessary, because all is reserved in the\r\ncase of the general government which is not given, while in the\r\nparticular ones, all is given which is not reserved, might do for the\r\naudience to which it was addressed; but it is surely a _gratis dictum_,\r\nthe reverse of which might just as well be said; and it is opposed by\r\nstrong inferences from the body of the instrument, as well as from the\r\nomission of the cause of our present Confederation, which had made the\r\nreservation in express terms. It was hard to conclude, because there\r\nhas been a want of uniformity among the States as to the cases triable\r\nby jury, because some have been so incautious as to dispense with this\r\nmode of trial in certain cases, therefore, the more prudent States\r\nshall be reduced to the same level of calamity. It would have been much\r\nmore just and wise to have concluded the other way, that as most of the\r\nStates had preserved with jealousy this sacred palladium of liberty,\r\nthose who had wandered, should be brought back to it; and to have\r\nestablished general right rather than general wrong. For I consider all\r\nthe ill as established, which may be established. I have a right to\r\nnothing, which another has a right to take away; and Congress will have\r\na right to take away trials by jury in all civil cases. Let me add,\r\nthat a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every\r\ngovernment on earth, general or particular; and what no just government\r\nshould refuse, or rest on inference.\r\n\r\nThe second feature I dislike, and strongly dislike, is the abandonment,\r\nin every instance, of the principle of rotation in office, and most\r\nparticularly in the case of the President. Reason and experience tell\r\nus, that the first magistrate will always be reelected if he may be\r\nre-elected. He is then an officer for life. This once observed, it\r\nbecomes of so much consequence to certain nations, to have a friend or\r\na foe at the head of our affairs, that they will interfere with money\r\nand with arms. A Galloman, or an Angloman, will be supported by the\r\nnation he befriends. If once elected, and at a second or third election\r\noutvoted by one or two votes, he will pretend false votes, foul play,\r\nhold possession of the reins of government, be supported by the States\r\nvoting for him, especially if they be the central ones, lying in a\r\ncompact body themselves, and separating their opponents; and they will\r\nbe aided by one nation in Europe, while the majority are aided by\r\nanother. The election of a President of America, some years hence, will\r\nbe much more interesting to certain nations of Europe, than ever the\r\nelection of a King of Poland was. Reflect on all the instances in\r\nhistory, ancient and modern, of elective monarchies, and say if they do\r\nnot give foundation for my fears; the Roman Emperors, the Popes while\r\nthey were of any importance, the German Emperors till they became\r\nhereditary in practice, the Kings of Poland, the Deys of the Ottoman\r\ndependencies. It may be said, that if elections are to be attended with\r\nthese disorders, the less frequently they are repeated the better. But\r\nexperience says, that to free them from disorder, they must be rendered\r\nless interesting by a necessity of change. No foreign power, nor\r\ndomestic party, will waste their blood and money to elect a person, who\r\nmust go out at the end of a short period. The power of removing every\r\nfourth year by the vote of the people, is a power which they will not\r\nexercise, and if they were disposed to exercise it, they would not be\r\npermitted. The King of Poland is removable every day by the diet. But\r\nthey never remove him. Nor would Russia, the Emperor, etc., permit them\r\nto do it. Smaller objections are, the appeals on matters of fact as\r\nwell as laws; and the binding all persons, legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary by oath, to maintain that constitution. I do not pretend to\r\ndecide, what would be the best method of procuring the establishment of\r\nthe manifold good things in this constitution, and of getting rid of\r\nthe bad. Whether by adopting it, in hopes of future amendment; or after\r\nit shall have been duly weighed and canvassed by the people, after\r\nseeing the parts they generally dislike, and those they generally\r\napprove, to say to them, \"We see now what you wish. You are willing to\r\ngive to your federal government such and such powers; but you wish, at\r\nthe same time, to have such and such fundamental rights secured to you,\r\nand certain sources of convulsion taken away. Be it so. Send together\r\ndeputies again. Let them establish your fundamental rights by a\r\nsacrosanct declaration, and let them pass the parts of the Constitution\r\nyou have approved. These will give powers to your federal government\r\nsufficient for your happiness.\"\r\n\r\nThis is what might be said, and would probably produce a speedy, more\r\nperfect and more permanent form of government. At all events, I hope\r\nyou will not be discouraged from making other trials, if the present\r\none should fail. We are never permitted to despair of the commonwealth.\r\nI have thus told you freely what I like, and what I dislike, merely as\r\na matter of curiosity; for I know it is not in my power to offer matter\r\nof information to your judgment, which has been formed after hearing\r\nand weighing everything which the wisdom of man could offer on these\r\nsubjects. I own, I am not a friend to a very energetic government. It\r\nis always oppressive. It places the governors indeed more at their\r\nease, at the expense of the people. The late rebellion in Massachusetts\r\nhas given more alarm, than I think it should have done. Calculate that\r\none rebellion in thirteen States in the course of eleven years, is but\r\none for each State in a century and a half. No country should be so\r\nlong without one. Nor will any degree of power in the hands of\r\ngovernment, prevent insurrections. In England, where the hand of power\r\nis heavier than with us, there are seldom half a dozen years without an\r\ninsurrection. In France, where it is still heavier, but less despotic,\r\nas Montesquieu supposes, than in some other countries, and where there\r\nare always two or three hundred thousand men ready to crush\r\ninsurrections, there have been three in the course of the three years I\r\nhave been here, in every one of which greater numbers were engaged than\r\nin Massachusetts, and a great deal more blood was spilt. In Turkey,\r\nwhere the sole nod of the despot is death, insurrections are the events\r\nof every day. Compare again the ferocious depredations of their\r\ninsurgents, with the order, the moderation and the almost\r\nself-extinguishment of ours. And say, finally, whether peace is best\r\npreserved by giving energy to the government, or information to the\r\npeople. This last is the most certain, and the most legitimate engine\r\nof government. Educate and inform the whole mass of the people. Enable\r\nthem to see that it is their interest to preserve peace and order, and\r\nthey will preserve them. And it requires no very high degree of\r\neducation to convince them of this. They are the only sure reliance for\r\nthe preservation of our liberty. After all, it is my principle that the\r\nwill of the majority should prevail. If they approve the proposed\r\nconstitution in all its parts, I shall concur in it cheerfully, in\r\nhopes they will amend it, whenever they shall find it works wrong. This\r\nreliance cannot deceive us, as long as we remain virtuous; and I think\r\nwe shall be so, as long as agriculture is our principal object, which\r\nwill be the case, while there remains vacant lands in any part of\r\nAmerica. When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in\r\nEurope, we shall become corrupt as in Europe, and go to eating one\r\nanother as they do there. I have tired you by this time with\r\ndisquisitions which you have already heard repeated by others a\r\nthousand and a thousand times; and therefore, shall only add assurances\r\nof the esteem and attachment with which I have the honor to be, dear\r\nSir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. The instability of our laws is really an immense evil. I think it\r\nwould be well to provide in our constitutions, that there shall always\r\nbe a twelvemonth between the engrossing a bill and passing it; that it\r\nshould then be offered to its passage without changing a word; and that\r\nif circumstances should be thought to require a speedier passage, it\r\nshould take two-thirds of both Houses, instead of a bare majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. CARRINGTON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Dec. 21, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have just received your two favors of October the 23d and\r\nNovember the 10th. I am much obliged to you for your hints in the\r\nDanish business. They are the only information I have on that subject,\r\nexcept the resolution of Congress, and warn me of a rock on which I\r\nshould most certainly have split. The vote plainly points out an agent,\r\nonly leaving it to my discretion to substitute another. My judgment\r\nconcurs with that of Congress as to his fitness. But I shall inquire\r\nfor the surest banker at Copenhagen to receive the money, not because I\r\nshould have had any doubts, but because I am informed others have them.\r\nAgainst the failure of a banker, were such an accident, or any similar\r\none to happen, I cannot be held accountable in a case where I act\r\nwithout particular interest. My principal idea in proposing the\r\ntransfer of the French debt, was, to obtain on the new loans a much\r\nlonger day for the reimbursement of the principal, hoping that the\r\nresources of the United States could have been equal to the article of\r\ninterest alone. But I shall endeavor to quiet, as well as I can, those\r\ninterested. A part of them will probably sell out at any rate; and one\r\ngreat claimant may be expected to make a bitter attack on our honor. I\r\nam very much pleased to hear, that our western lands sell so\r\nsuccessfully. I turn to this precious resource, as that which will, in\r\nevery event, liberate us from our domestic debt, and perhaps too, from\r\nour foreign one; and this, much sooner than I had expected. I do not\r\nthink any thing could have been done with them in Europe. Individual\r\nspeculators and sharpers had duped so many with their unlocated\r\nland-warrants, that every offer would have been suspected.\r\n\r\nAs to the new Constitution, I find myself nearly a neutral. There is a\r\ngreat mass of good in it, in a very desirable form; but there is also,\r\nto me, a bitter pill or two. I have written somewhat lengthily to Mr.\r\nMadison on this subject, and will take the liberty to refer you to that\r\npart of my letter to him. I will add one question to what I have said\r\nthere. Would it not have been better to assign to Congress exclusively\r\nthe article of imposts for federal purposes, and to have left direct\r\ntaxation exclusively to the States? I should suppose the former fund\r\nsufficient for all probable events, aided by the land office.\r\n\r\nThe form which the affairs of Europe may assume, is not yet\r\ndecipherable by those out of the cabinet. The Emperor gives himself, at\r\npresent, the air of a mediator. This is necessary to justify a breach\r\nwith the Porte. He has his eye at the same time on Germany, and\r\nparticularly on Bavaria, the Elector of which has, for a long time,\r\nbeen hanging over the grave. Probably, France would now consent to the\r\nexchange of the Austrian Netherlands, to be created into a kingdom for\r\nthe Duke de Deuxports, against the electorate of Bavaria. This will\r\nrequire a war. The Empress longs for Turkey, and viewing France as her\r\nprincipal obstacle, would gladly negotiate her acquiescence. To spur on\r\nthis, she is coquetting it with England. The King of Prussia, too, is\r\nplaying a double game between France and England. But I suppose the\r\nformer incapable of forgiving him, or of ever reposing confidence in\r\nhim. Perhaps the spring may unfold to us the final arrangement which\r\nwill take place among the powers of this continent.\r\n\r\nI often doubt whether I should trouble Congress or my friends with\r\nthese details of European politics. I know they do not excite that\r\ninterest in America, of which it is impossible for one to divest\r\nhimself here. I know, too, that it is a maxim with us, and I think it a\r\nwise one, not to entangle ourselves with the affairs of Europe. Still,\r\nI think, we should know them. The Turks have practiced the same maxim\r\nof not meddling in the complicated wrangles of this continent. But they\r\nhave unwisely chosen to be ignorant of them also, and it is this total\r\nignorance of Europe, its combinations and its movements, which exposes\r\nthem to that annihilation possibly about taking place. While there are\r\npowers in Europe which fear our views, or have views on us, we should\r\nkeep an eye on them, their connections and oppositions, that in a\r\nmoment of need, we may avail ourselves of their weakness with respect\r\nto others as well as ourselves, and calculate their designs and\r\nmovements, on all the circumstances under which they exist. Though I am\r\npersuaded, therefore, that these details are read by many with great\r\nindifference, yet I think it my duty to enter into them, and to run the\r\nrisk of giving too much, rather than too little information. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with perfect esteem and respect, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. The resolution of Congress, relative to the prize money received\r\nhere, speaks of that money as paid to me. I hope this matter is\r\nproperly understood. The treasury board desired me to receive it, and\r\napply it to such and such federal purposes; and they would pay the\r\ndividends of the claimants in America. This would save the expense of\r\nremittance. I declined, however, receiving the money, and ordered it\r\ninto the hands of their banker, who paid it away for the purposes to\r\nwhich they had destined it. I should be sorry, an idea should get\r\nabroad, that I had received the money of these poor fellows, and\r\napplied it to other purposes. I shall, in like manner, order the Danish\r\nand Barbary money into the hands of bankers, carefully avoiding ever to\r\ntouch a sou of it, or having any other account to make out than what\r\nthe banker will furnish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Dec. 21, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--The last letters I had the honor of addressing you were of the 3d\r\nand 7th of November. Your several favors, to wit, two of July 27, two\r\nof Oct. 24, and one of Nov. 3, have all been delivered within the\r\ncourse of a week past; and I embrace the earliest occasion of returning\r\nto Congress my sincere thanks for the new proofs I receive therein of\r\ntheir confidence in me, and of assuring them of my best endeavors to\r\nmerit it. The several matters on which I receive instruction shall all\r\nbe duly attended to. The Commissioners of the Treasury inform me they\r\nwill settle the balance appropriated to the Barbary business, apprise\r\nme of it, and place it under my power. The moment this is done, I will\r\ntake the measures necessary to effect the instructions of Congress. The\r\nletter to you from the Governor of Rhode Island desires my attention to\r\nthe application of the claimants of the brig Apollonia, which shall\r\nsurely be complied with. I trust that an application will be made by\r\nthe claimants. It will be the more important, as the letter in this\r\ncase, as in that of the sloop Sally, formerly recommended to me, is\r\ndirected to an advocate whom all my endeavors have not enabled me to\r\nfind. I fear, therefore, that the papers in both cases must remain in\r\nmy hands till called for by the person whom the parties shall employ\r\nfor the ordinary solicitation and management of their appeals. I\r\nsuppose they will engage some person to answer from time to time the\r\npecuniary demands of lawyers, clerks, and other officers of the courts,\r\nto wait upon the judges and explain their cases to them, which is the\r\nusage here, to instruct their lawyers and confer with them whenever\r\nnecessary, and in general to give all those attentions which the\r\nsolicitation of private causes constantly require here. Their\r\nmanagement, indeed, is very much a matter of intrigue and of money.\r\n\r\nThe public affairs of Europe are quiet at present, except as between\r\nthe Turks and Russians; and, even these, some people suppose may be\r\nquieted. It is thought that Russia would accommodate easily. The peace\r\nbetween France and England is very generally considered as insecure. It\r\nis said the latter is not honestly disarming; she is certainly\r\naugmenting her land forces, and the speech of the King, and debates of\r\nthe court members, prove their diffidence in the late accommodation.\r\nYet it is believed their premier is a friend to peace, and there can be\r\nno doubt of the same dispositions in the chief minister here. The\r\ndivisions continue between the King and his parliament. A promise has\r\nbeen obtained for convoking the States General, as early as 1791, at\r\nfarthest. The embarrassments in the department of finance are not yet\r\nso cleared up as that the public can see their way through them. The\r\narrival of the Count de La Luzerne, just now announced, will probably\r\nput their marine operations into new activity.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you three letters from Mr. Dumas. By one of\r\nthe 23d of October, he proposed to me that Mr. Adams and myself should\r\nauthorize him to go to Brussels on the subject he explains to you. I\r\nwrote him the answer of Nov. 14th, by which I expected he would see\r\nthat nothing could be done, and think no more of it. His subsequent\r\nletters, however, giving me reason to apprehend that, making too sure\r\nof the expediency of the treaty he proposed, he might excite\r\nexpectations from that government, I wrote him the letter of Dec. 9 to\r\nsuggest to him that this proposition might not be so certainly eligible\r\nas he seemed to expect, and to advise him to avoid doing anything which\r\nmight commit or embarrass Congress. The uneasiness of his present\r\nsituation, and the desire of a refuge from it, had probably suggested\r\nto him this idea, and occasioned him to view it with partiality.\r\n\r\nThis will be accompanied with the gazettes of France and Leyden. There\r\nbeing no passenger to go by the packet, within my knowledge, this\r\nletter will go through the post-office. I shall, therefore, only add\r\nassurances of the esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LIMOZIN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 22, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor now, to acknowledge the receipt of your favors\r\nof the 18th and 19th of November, and two of the 18th of the present\r\nmonth. I did not write to you immediately on the receipt of the two\r\nfirst, because the observations they contained were to be acted on\r\nhere. I was much obliged to you for them, as I have been frequently\r\nbefore for others, and you will find that I have profited by them in\r\nthe _Arret_ which is to come out for the regulation of our commerce,\r\nwherein most of the things are provided for, which you have from time\r\nto time recommended. With respect to the article of yellow wax, I think\r\nthere is a general clause in the _Arret_, which will take it in; but I\r\nam not sure of it. If there be not, it is now too late to get any\r\nalteration made. You shall receive the _Arret_ the moment it is\r\ncommunicated to me.\r\n\r\nI have examined the case of Captain Thomas, with all the dispositions\r\npossible to interpose for him. But on mature reflection, I find it is\r\none of those cases wherein my solicitation would be ill received. The\r\ngovernment of France, to secure to its subjects the carrying trade\r\nbetween her colonies and the mother country, have made a law,\r\nforbidding any foreign vessels to undertake to carry between them.\r\nNotwithstanding this, an American vessel has undertaken, and has\r\nbrought a cargo. For me to ask that this vessel shall be received,\r\nwould be to ask a repeal of the law, because there is no more reason\r\nfor receiving her, than there will be for receiving the second, third,\r\netc., which shall act against the same law, nor for receiving an\r\nAmerican vessel, more than the vessels of any other nations. Captain\r\nThomas has probably engaged in this business, not knowing the law; but\r\nignorance of the law is no excuse, in any country. If it were, the laws\r\nwould lose their effect, because it can be always pretended. Were I to\r\nmake this application to the Comptroller General, he might possibly ask\r\nme, whether, in a like case, of a French vessel in America acting\r\nthrough ignorance, against law, we would suspend the law as to her? I\r\nshould be obliged honestly to answer, that with us, there is no power\r\nwhich can suspend the law for a moment; and Captain Thomas knows that\r\nthis answer would be the truth. The Senegal company seems to be as much\r\nengaged in it as he is. I should suppose his most probable means of\r\nextrication would be with their assistance, and availing himself of\r\ntheir privileges, and the apparent authority he has received from the\r\nofficers of government there. I am sorry his case is such a one as I\r\ncannot present to the minister. A jealousy of our taking away their\r\ncarrying trade, is the principal reason which obstructs our admission\r\ninto their West India islands. It would not be right for me to\r\nstrengthen that jealousy.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much esteem, Sir, your most obedient\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE BOARD OF TREASURY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Dec. 30, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--In my letter of Aug. 5, I had the honor of enclosing to you\r\na letter written me by Messrs. Fiseaux & Co., reminding us that the\r\nprincipal of the loan of 51,000 florins obtained by them, would become\r\ndue on the first day of the ensuing year. A few days ago, I received\r\nanother from them calling for the money. At first I was disposed to\r\nanswer them that I was in nowise authorized to do anything in it, and\r\nthat it rested with you altogether. But, on consulting with some\r\npersons better acquainted with the delicacy of credit in Holland, I\r\nfound there was reason to fear that a failure to pay that money might\r\nnot only do essential injury to our credit in general, but even hinder\r\nthe progress of the loan going on in the hands of Willincks and Van\r\nStaphorsts; and that it would be for the interest of that loan itself,\r\nto pay this demand out of it, if possible. I wrote, therefore, to Mr.\r\nAdams, to consult him about it, and to know, if he was of the same\r\nopinion, whether he would venture to join me in directing such an\r\napplication of the money. I wrote at the same to Willincks and Van\r\nStaphorsts, to know whether they could have as much in their hands to\r\nspare, and whether they would venture to pay it on our order. Mr. Adams\r\napproved of the proposition, and was willing to join in ordering the\r\npayment. Willincks and Van Staphorsts answered that they had in their\r\nhands money enough to pay the February interest of the former loan, and\r\nto answer, for some time yet, Mr. Adams' and my draughts for our\r\nsubsistence; but that if they should pay the principal of Fiseaux's\r\nloan, it would be an advance of their own: they likewise observed, that\r\nto pay such a sum without your orders, placed them under an unnecessary\r\nresponsibility. Upon this, I concluded to ask them only to pay this\r\nyear's interest, now becoming due, to desire Fiseaux to receive this,\r\nand with it to endeavor to quiet the creditors till your orders could\r\nbe received. I have this day written to Fiseaux, and to Willincks and\r\nVan Staphorsts to this purpose, and avail myself of a vessel about to\r\nsail from Havre, to communicate the whole transaction to you, and to\r\nexpress my wish that you will be pleased to give an answer to Fiseaux.\r\nI enclose to you his letters to me on the subject. From what I can\r\nlearn, I suspect that if there were a cordial understanding between the\r\nWillincks and Van Staphorsts, if the former had been as well disposed\r\nas the latter, the matter would have been settled with Fiseaux. I have\r\nthe honor to be, with much respect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, December 31, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--Since the receipt of the letter of Monsieur de Calonnes, of\r\nOctober the 22d, 1786, I have several times had the honor of mentioning\r\nto you, that I was endeavoring to get the substance of that letter\r\nreduced into an _Arret_, which, instead of being revocable by a single\r\nletter of a Comptroller General, would require an _Arret_ to repeal or\r\nalter it, and of course must be discussed in full Council, and so give\r\ntime to prevent it. This has been pressed as much as it could be with\r\nprudence. One cause of delay has been the frequent changes of the\r\nComptroller General; as we had always our whole work to begin again\r\nwith every new one. Monsieur Lambert's continuance in office for some\r\nmonths, has enabled us, at length, to get through the business; and I\r\nhave just received from him a letter, and the _Arret_ duly\r\nauthenticated; of which I have the honor to send you a number of\r\nprinted copies. You will find that the several alterations and\r\nadditions are made, which, on my visit to the sea-ports, I had found to\r\nbe necessary, and which my letters of June the 21st and August the 6th,\r\nparticularly mentioned to you. Besides these, we have obtained some new\r\narticles of value, for which openings arose in the course of the\r\nnegotiation. I say _we_ have done it, because the Marquis de La Fayette\r\nhas gone hand in hand with me through this business, and has been a\r\nmost invaluable aid. I take the liberty of making some observations on\r\nthe articles of the _Arret_, severally, for their explanation, as well\r\nas for the information of Congress.\r\n\r\nArticle 1. In the course of our conferences with the Comptroller\r\nGeneral, we had prevailed on him to pass this article with a\r\nsuppression of all duty. When he reported the _Arret_, however, to the\r\nCouncil, this suppression was objected to, and it was insisted to\r\nre-establish the duties of seven livres and ten sous, and of ten sous\r\nthe livre, reserved in the letter of M. de Calonnes. The passage of the\r\n_Arret_ was stopped, and the difficulty communicated to me. I urged\r\neverything I could, in letters and in conferences, to convince them\r\nthat whale oil was an article which could bear no duty at all. That if\r\nthe duty fell on the consumer, he would choose to buy vegetable oils;\r\nif on the fisherman, he could no longer live by his calling, remaining\r\nin his own country; and that if he quitted his own country, the\r\ncircumstances of vicinity, sameness of language, laws, religion and\r\nmanners, and perhaps the ties of kindred, would draw him to Nova\r\nScotia, in spite of every encouragement which could be given at\r\nDunkirk; and that thus those fishermen would be shifted out of a scale\r\nfriendly to France, into one always hostile. Nothing, however, could\r\nprevail. It hung on this article alone, for two months, during which we\r\nrisked the total loss of the _Arret_, on the stability in office of\r\nMonsieur Lambert; for if he had gone out, his successor might be less\r\nfavorable; and if Monsieur Neckar were the successor, we might lose the\r\nwhole, as he never set any store by us, or the connection with us.\r\nAbout ten days ago, it became universally believed that Monsieur\r\nLambert was to go out immediately. I, therefore, declined further\r\ninsisting on the total suppression, and desired the _Arret_ might pass,\r\nleaving the duties on whale oil as Monsieur de Calonnes had promised\r\nthem; but with a reservation, which may countenance our bringing on\r\nthis matter again, at a more favorable moment.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. The other fish oils are placed in a separate article;\r\nbecause whatever encouragements we may hereafter obtain for whale oils,\r\nthey will not be extended to those which their own fisheries produce.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. A company had silently, and by unfair means, obtained a\r\nmonopoly for the making and selling spermaceti candles: as soon as we\r\ndiscovered it, we solicited its suppression, which is effected by this\r\nclause.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. The duty of an eighth per cent. is merely to oblige the\r\nmasters of vessels to enter their cargoes, for the information of\r\ngovernment; without inducing them to attempt to smuggle.\r\n\r\nArticle 6. Tar, pitch and turpentine of America, coming in competition\r\nwith the same articles produced in the south-western parts of France,\r\nwe could obtain no greater reduction, than two and a-half per cent. The\r\nduties before, were from four to six times that amount.\r\n\r\nArticle 10. The right of entrepot given by this article, is almost the\r\nsame thing, as the making all their ports, free ports for us. The ships\r\nare, indeed, subject to be visited, and the cargoes must be reported in\r\nports of entrepot, which need not be done in the free ports. But the\r\ncommunication between the entrepot and the country, is not interrupted\r\nby continual search of all persons passing into the country, which has\r\nproved so troublesome to the inhabitants of our free ports, as that a\r\nconsiderable proportion of them have wished to give back the privilege\r\nof their freedom.\r\n\r\nArticle 13. This article gives us the privileges and advantages of\r\nnative subjects, in all their possessions in Asia, and in the _scales\r\nleading thereto_. This expression means at present the isles of France\r\nand Bourbon, and will include the Cape of Good Hope, should any future\r\nevent put it into the hands of France. It was with a view to this, that\r\nI proposed the expression, because we were then in hourly expectation\r\nof a war, and it was suspected that France would take possession of\r\nthat place. It will, in no case, be considered as including anything\r\nwestward of the Cape of Good Hope. I must observe further, on this\r\narticle, that it will only become valuable on the suppression of their\r\nEast India Company; because, as long as their monopoly continues, even\r\nnative subjects cannot enter their Asiatic ports for the purposes of\r\ncommerce. It is considered, however, as certain, that this Company will\r\nbe immediately suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe article of tobacco could not be introduced into the _Arret_;\r\nbecause it was necessary to consider the Farmers General as parties to\r\nthat arrangement. It rests, therefore, of necessity, on the basis of a\r\nletter only. You will perceive that this is nothing more than a\r\ncontinuation of the order of Berni, only leaving the prices unfixed;\r\nand like that, it will require a constant and vexatious attention to\r\nhave its execution enforced.\r\n\r\nThe States who have much to carry, and few carriers, will observe,\r\nperhaps, that the benefits of these regulations are somewhat narrowed\r\nby confining them to articles brought hither in French or American\r\nbottoms. But they will consider that nothing in these instruments moves\r\nfrom us. The advantages they hold out are all given by this country to\r\nus, and the givers will modify their gifts as they please. I suppose it\r\nto be a determined principle of this court not to suffer our carrying\r\nbusiness, so far as their consumption of our commodities extends, to\r\nbecome a nursery for British seamen. Nor would this, perhaps, be\r\nadvantageous to us, considering the dispositions of the two nations\r\ntowards us. The preference which our shipping will obtain on this\r\naccount, may counterpoise the discouragements it experiences from the\r\naggravated dangers of the Barbary States. Nor is the idea unpleasing\r\nwhich shows itself in various parts of these papers, of naturalizing\r\nAmerican bottoms, and American citizens in France and in its foreign\r\npossessions. Once established here, and in their eastern settlements,\r\nthey may revolt less at the proposition to extend it to those westward.\r\nThey are not yet, however, at that point; we must be contented to go\r\ntowards it a step at a time, and trust to future events for hastening\r\nour progress.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the alliance between this and the two imperial courts,\r\nnothing certain transpires. We are enabled to conjecture its progress\r\nonly from facts which now and then show themselves. The following may\r\nbe considered as indications of it. 1. The Emperor has made an attempt\r\nto surprise Belgrade. The attempt failed, but will serve to plunge him\r\ninto the war, and to show that he had assumed the character of\r\nmediator, only to enable himself to gain some advantage by surprise. 2.\r\nThe mediation of France is probably at an end, and their abandonment of\r\nthe Turks agreed on; because they have secretly ordered their officers\r\nto quit the Turkish service. This fact is known to but few, and not\r\nintended to be known; but I think it certain. 3. To the offer of\r\nmediation lately made by England and Prussia, the court of Petersburg\r\nanswered, that having declined the mediation of a friendly power,\r\n(France,) she could not accept that of two courts, with whose\r\ndispositions she had reason to be dissatisfied. 4. The States General\r\nare said to have instructed their Ambassador here, lately, to ask of M.\r\nde Montmorin, whether the inquiry had been made, which they had\r\nformerly desired: \"By what authority the French engineers had been\r\nplaced in the service of Holland?\" And that he answered that the\r\ninquiry had not been made, nor should be made. Though I do not consider\r\nthe channel through which I get this fact, as absolutely sure, yet it\r\nis so respectable that I give credit to it myself. 5. The King of\r\nPrussia is withdrawing his troops from Holland. Should this alliance\r\nshow itself, it would seem that France thus strengthened might dictate\r\nthe re-establishment of the affairs of Holland in her own form. For it\r\nis not conceivable that Prussia would dare to move, nor that England\r\nwould alone undertake such a war, and for such a purpose. She appears,\r\nindeed, triumphant at present, but the question is who will triumph\r\nlast?\r\n\r\nI enclose you a letter from Mr. Dumas. I received one from him myself,\r\nwherein he assures me that no difficulties shall be produced, by what\r\nhe had suggested relative to his mission to Brussels. The gazettes of\r\nFrance and Leyden to this date accompany this letter, which, with the\r\nseveral papers put under your cover, I shall send to M. Limozin, our\r\nagent at Havre, to be forwarded by the Juno, Captain Jenkins, which\r\nsails from that port for New York, on the 3d of January.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LAMBERT.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 3, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am honored with your Excellency's letter of the 29th of\r\nDecember, enclosing the _Arret_ on the commerce between France and the\r\nUnited States. I availed myself of the occasion of a vessel sailing\r\nthis day from Havre for New York, to forward it to Congress. They will\r\nreceive with singular satisfaction this new testimony of his Majesty's\r\nfriendship for the United States, of his dispositions to promote their\r\ninterest, and to strengthen the bands which connect the two nations.\r\n\r\nPermit me, Sir, to return you, personally, my sincere thanks for the\r\ngreat attention you have paid to this subject, for the sacrifices you\r\nhave kindly made, of time so precious as yours, every moment of which\r\nis demanded and is occupied by objects interesting to the happiness of\r\nmillions; and to proffer you the homage of those sincere sentiments of\r\nattachment and respect with which I have the honor to be, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE QUESNAY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 6, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have never expressed an objection to the part of your plan\r\nrelative to the theatre. The utility of this in America is a great\r\nquestion on which I may be allowed to have an opinion; but it is not\r\nfor me to decide on it, nor to object to the proposal of establishing\r\none at Richmond. The only objection to your plan which I have ever\r\nmade, is that contained in my letter to you. I feared it was too\r\nextensive for the poverty of the country. You remove the objection by\r\nobserving, it is to extend to several States. Whether professors\r\nitinerant from one State to another may succeed, I am unable to say,\r\nhaving never known an experiment of it. The fear that these professors\r\nmay be disappointed in their expectations, has determined me not to\r\nmeddle in the business at all. Knowing how much people going to America\r\noverrate the resources of living there, I have made a point never to\r\nencourage any person to go there, that I may not partake of the censure\r\nwhich may follow their disappointment. I beg you, therefore, not to\r\nalter your plan in any part of it on my account, but permit me to\r\npursue mine of being absolutely neutral. Monsieur de La Luzerne and the\r\nMarquis de La Fayette, know too much of the country themselves to need\r\nany information from me, or any reference to my opinion; and the\r\nfriendly dispositions which they have towards you, will insure you\r\ntheir good offices. Convinced of the honesty of your intentions and of\r\nyour zeal, I wish you every possible success, and shall be really happy\r\nto see your plan answer your expectations. You have more courage than I\r\nhave, to take upon yourself the risk of transplanting and contenting so\r\nmany persons. I beg you to be assured of the sincerity of the esteem\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DRAYTON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 13, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--By Captain Shewell, who is sailing about this time from\r\nMarseilles to Charleston, I directed to be forwarded to you one of two\r\ncouffes of rough rice, which I had brought from Egypt. The other came\r\non to me here, and will be carried from Havre to New York, addressed to\r\nyou, to the care of the Delegates of South Carolina in Congress. I wish\r\nboth may arrive in time for the approaching seed time, and that the\r\ntrials with this and the Piedmont rice may furnish new advantages to\r\nyour agriculture. I have considerable hopes of receiving some dry rice\r\nfrom Cochin-China, the young Prince of that country, lately gone from\r\nhence, having undertaken that it shall come to me. But it will be some\r\ntime first. These are all but experiments; the precept, however, is\r\nwise which directs us to try all things, and hold fast that which is\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nYour letter of May the 22d, 1787, informs me that mine of May the 6th,\r\n1786, had never got to hand. I now have the honor to enclose you a copy\r\nof it, of no other consequence than to show you that I was incapable of\r\nso insensible an inattention as the miscarriage of that letter exposed\r\nme to the charge of in your mind. I shall take opportunities of\r\nforwarding to you more of the seed of the Spanish Saintfoine, some of\r\nwhich I have received directly from Malta. I have the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LE COMTE BERNSTORFF, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, COPENHAGEN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, January 21, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am instructed by the United States of America, in Congress\r\nassembled, to bring again under the consideration of his Majesty, the\r\nKing of Denmark, and of his ministers, the case of the three prizes\r\ntaken from the English during the late war, by an American squadron\r\nunder the command of Commodore Paul Jones, put into Bergen in distress,\r\nthere rescued from our possession by orders from the court of Denmark,\r\nand delivered back to the English. Dr. Franklin, then Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary from the United States at the court of Versailles, had\r\nthe honor of making applications to the court of Denmark, for a just\r\nindemnification to the persons interested, and particularly by a letter\r\nof the 22d of December, 1779, a copy of which I have now the honor of\r\nenclosing to your Excellency. In consequence of this, a sum of ten\r\nthousand pounds was proposed to him, as an indemnification, through the\r\nBaron de Waltersdorff, then at Paris. The departure of both those\r\ngentlemen from this place, soon after, occasioned an intermission in\r\nthe correspondence on this subject. But the United States continue to\r\nbe very sensibly affected by this delivery of their prizes to Great\r\nBritain, and the more so, as no part of their conduct had forfeited\r\ntheir claim to those rights of hospitality which civilized nations\r\nextend to each other. Not only a sense of justice due to the\r\nindividuals interested in those prizes, but also an earnest desire that\r\nno subject of discontent may check the cultivation and progress of that\r\nfriendship which they wish may subsist and increase between the two\r\ncountries, prompt them to remind his Majesty of the transaction in\r\nquestion; and they flatter themselves that his Majesty will concur with\r\nthem in thinking, that as restitution of the prizes is not practicable,\r\nit is reasonable and just that he should render, and that they should\r\naccept, a compensation equivalent to the value of them. And the same\r\nprinciples of justice towards the parties, and of amity to the United\r\nStates, which influenced the breast of his Majesty to make, through the\r\nBaron de Waltersdorff, the proposition of a particular sum, will surely\r\nlead him to restore their full value, if that were greater, as is\r\nbelieved, than the sum proposed. In order to obtain, therefore, a final\r\narrangement of this demand, Congress have authorized me to depute a\r\nspecial agent to Copenhagen, to attend the pleasure of his Majesty. No\r\nagent could be so adequate to this business, as the Commodore Paul\r\nJones, who commanded the squadron which took the prizes. He will,\r\ntherefore, have the honor of delivering this letter to your Excellency,\r\nin person; of giving such information as may be material, relative to\r\nthe whole transaction; of entering into conferences for its final\r\nadjustment, and, being himself principally interested, not only in his\r\nown right, but as the natural patron of those who fought under him,\r\nwhatever shall be satisfactory to him, will have a great right to that\r\nultimate approbation, which Congress have been pleased to confide to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI beg your Excellency to accept the homage of that respect which your\r\nexalted station, talents, and merit impress, as well as those\r\nsentiments of esteem and regard with which I have the honor to be, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WILLIAM RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Feb. 2, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I should sooner have answered your favor of Jan. the 2d, but\r\nthat we have expected for some time to see you here. I beg you not to\r\nthink of the trifle I furnished you with, nor to propose to return it,\r\ntill you shall have that sum more than you know what to do with. And on\r\nevery other occasion of difficulty, I hope you will make use of me\r\nfreely. I presume you will now remain at London, to see the trial of\r\nHastings. Without suffering yourself to be imposed on by the pomp in\r\nwhich it will be enveloped, I would recommend to you to consider and\r\ndecide for yourself these questions. If his offence is to be decided by\r\nthe law of the land, why is he not tried in that court in which his\r\nfellow-citizens are tried, that is, the King's bench? If he is cited\r\nbefore another court, that he may be judged, not according to the law\r\nof the land, but by the discretion of his judges, is he not\r\ndisfranchised of his most precious right, the benefit of the laws of\r\nhis country, in common with his fellow-citizens? I think you will find,\r\nin investigating this subject, that every solid argument is against the\r\nextraordinary court, and that every one in its favor is specious only.\r\nIt is a transfer from a judicature of learning and integrity, to one,\r\nthe greatness of which is both illiterate and unprincipled. Yet such is\r\nthe force of prejudice with some, and of the want of reflection in\r\nothers, that many of our constitutions have copied this absurdity,\r\nwithout suspecting it to be one. I am glad to hear that our new\r\nConstitution is pretty sure of being accepted by States enough to\r\nsecure the good it contains, and to meet with such opposition in some\r\nothers, as to give us hopes it will be accommodated to them, by the\r\namendment of its most glaring faults, particularly the want of a\r\ndeclaration of rights.\r\n\r\nThe long expected edict of the Protestants, at length appears here. Its\r\nanalysis is this. It is an acknowledgment (hitherto withheld by the\r\nlaws) that Protestants can beget children, and that they can die, and\r\nbe offensive unless buried. It does not give them permission to think,\r\nto speak, or to worship. It enumerates the humiliations to which they\r\nshall remain subject, and the burthens to which they shall continue to\r\nbe unjustly exposed. What are we to think of the condition of the human\r\nmind in a country, where such a wretched thing as this has thrown the\r\nState into convulsions, and how must we bless our own situation in a\r\ncountry, the most illiterate peasant of which is a Solon, compared with\r\nthe authors of this law. There is modesty often, which does itself\r\ninjury; our countrymen possess this. They do not know their own\r\nsuperiority. You see it; you are young, you have time and talents to\r\ncorrect them. Study the subject while in Europe, in all the instances\r\nwhich will present themselves to you, and profit your countrymen of\r\nthem, by making them to know and value themselves.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Sir, and be assured of the esteem with which I am your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Feb. 6, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The Commissioners of the Treasury have given notice to\r\nWillincks and Van Staphorsts, that they shall not be able to remit them\r\none shilling till the New Government gets into action, and that\r\ntherefore the sole resource for the payment of the Dutch interest till\r\nthat period is in the progress of the last loan. Willinck and Van\r\nStaphorst reply that there is not the least probability of raising as\r\nmuch on that loan as will pay the next June interest, and that, if that\r\npayment fails one day, it will do an injury to our credit, which a very\r\nlong time will not wipe off. A Mr. Stanitski, one of our brokers, who\r\nholds $4,340,000 of our domestic debt, offers, if we will pay him one\r\nyear's interest of that debt, he will have the whole of the loan\r\nimmediately filled up, that is to say, he will procure the sum of six\r\nhundred and twenty-two thousand eight hundred and forty florins still\r\nunsubscribed. His year's interest (deducting from it ten per cent.\r\nwhich he will allow for payment in Europe instead of America) will\r\nrequire one hundred and eighty thousand florins of this money. Messrs.\r\nWillinck and Van Staphorsts say that, by this means, they can pay\r\nFiseaux' debt, and all the Dutch interest, and our current expenses\r\nhere, till June, 1789, by which time the New Government may be in\r\naction. They have proposed this to the Commissioners of the Treasury;\r\nBut it is possible that the delay of letters going and coming, with the\r\ntime necessary between the receiving their answer and procuring the\r\nmoney, may force the decision of this proposition on me at the eleventh\r\nhour. I wish, therefore, to avail myself of your counsel before your\r\ndeparture, on this proposition. Your knowledge of the subject enables\r\nyou to give the best opinion, and your zeal for the public interest,\r\nand I trust your friendly disposition towards me will prompt you to\r\nassist me with your advice on this question, to wit, if the answer of\r\nthe Commissioners does not come in time, and there shall appear no\r\nother means of raising the June interest, will it be worse to fail in\r\nthat payment, or to accept of about seven hundred thousand florins, on\r\nthe condition of letting one hundred and eighty thousand be applied to\r\nthe payment of a year's interest of a part of our domestic debt? Do me\r\nthe friendship to give me an answer to this as soon as possible, and be\r\nassured of the sentiments of esteem and respect with which I have the\r\nhonor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Feb. 7, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--Your favors of November the 10th and 13th, and December the\r\n5th, have been duly received. Commodore Jones left this place for\r\nCopenhagen, the 5th instant, to carry into execution the resolution of\r\nCongress of October the 25th. Whatever moneys that court shall be\r\nwilling to allow, shall be remitted to your bankers, either in\r\nAmsterdam or Paris, as shall be found most beneficial, allowing\r\npreviously to be withdrawn Commodore Jones' proportion, which will be\r\nnecessary for his subsistence. I desired him to endeavor to prevail on\r\nthe Danish Minister to have the money paid in Amsterdam or Paris, by\r\ntheir banker in either of those cities, if they have one.\r\n\r\nM. Ast (secretary to the consulate) is at L'Orient. Whether he comes up\r\nwith the papers, or sends them, they shall be received, sealed up and\r\ntaken care of. I will only ask the favor of you, that I may never be\r\ndesired to break the seals, unless very important cause for it should\r\narise.\r\n\r\nI have just received from Messrs. Willincks and Van Staphorsts, a\r\nletter of January the 31st, in which are these words: \"The official\r\ncommunication we have of the actual situation and prospect of the\r\nfinances of the United States, would render such a partial payment as\r\nthat to Fiseaux' house of no avail towards the support of the public\r\ncredit, unless effectual measures shall be adopted, to provide funds\r\nfor the two hundred and seventy thousand florins, interest, that will\r\nbe due the 1st of June next; a single day's retard in which would\r\nground a prejudice of long duration.\" They informed me, at the same\r\ntime, that they had made to you the following communication: that Mr.\r\nStanitski, our principal broker, and holder of thirteen hundred and\r\nforty thousand dollars, of certificates of our domestic debt, offers to\r\nhave our loan of a million of guilders (of which six hundred and\r\ntwenty-two thousand eight hundred and forty are still unfilled)\r\nimmediately made up, on condition that he may retain thereout, one\r\nhundred and eighty thousand guilders, being one year's interest on his\r\ncertificates, allowing a deduction of ten per cent. from his said\r\ninterest, as a compensation for his receiving it in Amsterdam instead\r\nof America, and not pretending that this shall give him any title to\r\nask for any payment of future interest in Europe. They observe, that\r\nthis will enable them to face the demands of Dutch interest, till the\r\n1st of June, 1789, pay the principal of Fiseaux' debt, and supply the\r\ncurrent expenses of your legation in Europe. On these points, it is for\r\nyou to decide. I will only take the liberty to observe, that if they\r\nshall receive your acceptance of the proposition, some day's credit\r\nwill still be to be given for producing the cash, and that this must be\r\nproduced fifteen days before it is wanting, because that much previous\r\nnotice is always given to the creditors that their money is ready. It\r\nis, therefore, but three months from this day, before your answer\r\nshould be in Amsterdam. It might answer a useful purpose also, could I\r\nreceive a communication of that answer, ten days earlier than they. The\r\nsame stagnation attending our passage from the old to the new form of\r\ngovernment, which stops the feeble channel of money hitherto flowing\r\ntowards our treasury, has suspended also what foreign credit we had. So\r\nthat, at this moment, we may consider the progress of our loan as\r\nstopped. Though much an enemy to the system of borrowing, yet I feel\r\nstrongly the necessity of preserving the power to borrow, Without this,\r\nwe might be overwhelmed by another nation, merely by the force of its\r\ncredit. However, you can best judge whether the payment of a single\r\nyear's interest on Stanitski's certificates, in Europe, instead of\r\nAmerica, may be more injurious to us than the shock of our credit in\r\nAmsterdam, which may be produced by a failure to pay our interest.\r\n\r\nI have only to offer any services which I can render in this business,\r\neither here or by going to Holland, at a moment's warning, if that\r\nshould be necessary.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR PRICE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 7, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It is rendering mutual service to men of virtue and\r\nunderstanding to make them acquainted with one another. I need no other\r\napology for presenting to your notice the bearer hereof, Mr. Barlow. I\r\nknow you were among the first who read the Visions of Columbus, while\r\nyet in manuscript; and think the sentiments I heard you express of that\r\npoem will induce you to be pleased with the acquaintance of their\r\nauthor. He comes to pass a few days only at London, merely to know\r\nsomething of it. As I have little acquaintance there, I cannot do\r\nbetter for him than to ask you to be so good as to make him known to\r\nsuch persons, as his turn and his time might render desirable to him.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the volume you were so kind as to send me some time\r\nago. Everything you write is precious, and this volume is on the most\r\nprecious of all our concerns. We may well admit morality to be the\r\nchild of the understanding rather than of the senses, when we observe\r\nthat it becomes dearer to us as the latter weaken, and as the former\r\ngrows stronger by time and experience, till the hour arrives in which\r\nall other objects lose all their value. That that hour may be distant\r\nwith you, my friend, and that the intermediate space may be filled with\r\nhealth and happiness, is the sincere prayer of him who is, with\r\nsentiments of great respect and friendship, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. A. DONALD.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 7, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received duly your friendly letter of November the 12th.\r\nBy this time, you will have seen published by Congress the new\r\nregulations obtained from this court, in favor of our commerce. You\r\nwill observe, that the arrangement relative to tobacco is a\r\ncontinuation of the order of Berni for five years, only leaving the\r\nprice to be settled between the buyer and seller. You will see, too,\r\nthat all contracts for tobacco are forbidden, till it arrives in\r\nFrance. Of course, your proposition for a contract is precluded. I fear\r\nthe prices here will be low, especially if the market be crowded. You\r\nshould be particularly attentive to the article, which requires that\r\nthe tobacco should come in French or American bottoms, as this article\r\nwill, in no instance, be departed from.\r\n\r\nI wish with all my soul, that the nine first conventions may accept the\r\nnew constitution, because this will secure to us the good it contains,\r\nwhich I think great and important. But I equally wish, that the four\r\nlatest conventions, whichever they be, may refuse to accede to it, till\r\na declaration of rights be annexed. This would probably command the\r\noffer of such a declaration, and thus give to the whole fabric,\r\nperhaps, as much perfection as any one of that kind ever had. By a\r\ndeclaration of rights, I mean one which shall stipulate freedom of\r\nreligion, freedom of the press, freedom of commerce against monopolies,\r\ntrial by juries in all cases, no suspensions of the habeas corpus, no\r\nstanding armies. These are fetters against doing evil, which no honest\r\ngovernment should decline. There is another strong feature in the new\r\nConstitution, which I as strongly dislike. That is, the perpetual\r\nre-eligibility of the President. Of this I expect no amendment at\r\npresent, because I do not see that anybody has objected to it on your\r\nside the water. But it will be productive of cruel distress to our\r\ncountry, even in your day and mine. The importance to France and\r\nEngland, to have our government in the hands of a friend or a foe, will\r\noccasion their interference by money, and even by arms. Our President\r\nwill be of much more consequence to them than a King of Poland. We must\r\ntake care, however, that neither this, nor any other objection to the\r\nnew form, produces a schism in our Union. That would be an incurable\r\nevil, because near friends falling out, never re-unite cordially;\r\nwhereas, all of us going together, we shall be sure to cure the evils\r\nof our new Constitution, before they do great harm. The box of books I\r\nhad taken the liberty to address to you, is but just gone from Havre\r\nfor New York. I do not see, at present, any symptoms strongly\r\nindicating war. It is true, that the distrust existing between the two\r\ncourts of Versailles and London, is so great, that they can scarcely do\r\nbusiness together. However, the difficulty and doubt of obtaining money\r\nmake both afraid to enter into war. The little preparations for war,\r\nwhich we see, are the effect of distrust, rather than of a design to\r\ncommence hostilities. And in such a state of mind, you know, small\r\nthings may produce a rupture; so that though peace is rather probable,\r\nwar is very possible.\r\n\r\nYour letter has kindled all the fond recollections of ancient times;\r\nrecollections much dearer to me than anything I have known since. There\r\nare minds which can be pleased by honors and preferments; but I see\r\nnothing in them but envy and enmity. It is only necessary to possess\r\nthem, to know how little they contribute to happiness, or rather how\r\nhostile they are to it. No attachments soothe the mind so much as those\r\ncontracted in early life; nor do I recollect any societies which have\r\ngiven me more pleasure, than those of which you have partaken with me.\r\nI had rather be shut up in a very modest cottage, with my books, my\r\nfamily and a few old friends, dining on simple bacon, and letting the\r\nworld roll on as it liked, than to occupy the most splendid post, which\r\nany human power can give. I shall be glad to hear from you often. Give\r\nme the small news as well as the great. Tell Dr. Currie, that I believe\r\nI am indebted to him a letter, but that like the mass of our\r\ncountrymen, I am not, at this moment, able to pay all my debts; the\r\npost being to depart in an hour, and the last stroke of a pen I am able\r\nto send by it, being that which assures you of the sentiments of esteem\r\nand attachment, with which I am, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WARVILLE.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 12, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am very sensible of the honor you propose to me, of becoming a\r\nmember of the society for the abolition of the slave trade. You know\r\nthat nobody wishes more ardently to see an abolition, not only of the\r\ntrade, but of the condition of slavery; and certainly, nobody will be\r\nmore willing to encounter every sacrifice for that object. But the\r\ninfluence and information of the friends to this proposition in France\r\nwill be far above the need of my association. I am here as a public\r\nservant, and those whom I serve, having never yet been able to give\r\ntheir voice against the practice, it is decent for me to avoid too\r\npublic a demonstration of my wishes to see it abolished. Without\r\nserving the cause here, it might render me less able to serve it beyond\r\nthe water. I trust you will be sensible of the prudence of those\r\nmotives, therefore, which govern my conduct on this occasion, and be\r\nassured of my wishes for the success of your undertaking, and the\r\nsentiments of esteem and respect, with which I have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Feb. 12, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of the 5th inst. enclosing that\r\nfor Mr. Jay. The packet was gone, as I presume, but I have another\r\noccasion of forwarding it securely. Your attentions to the Leyden\r\ngazette are, in my opinion, very useful. The paper is much read and\r\nrespected. It is the only one I know in Europe which merits respect.\r\nYour publications in it will tend to re-establish that credit which the\r\nsolidity of our affairs deserve. With respect to the sale of lands, we\r\nknow that two sales of five millions and two millions of acres have\r\nbeen made. Another was begun for four millions, which, in the course of\r\nthe negotiation, may have been reduced to three millions, as you\r\nmention. I have not heard that this sale is absolutely concluded, but\r\nthere is reason to presume it. Stating these sales at two-thirds of a\r\ndollar the acre, and allowing for 3 or 400,000 acres sold at public\r\nsale, and a very high price, we may say they have absorbed seven\r\nmillions of dollars of the domestic federal debt. The States, by\r\ntaxation and otherwise, have absorbed eleven millions more: so that\r\ndebt stands now at about ten millions of dollars, and will probably be\r\nall absorbed in the course of the next year. There will remain then our\r\nforeign debt, between ten and twelve millions, including interest. The\r\nsale of lands will then go on for the payment of this. But, as this\r\npayment must be in cash, not in public effects, the lands must be sold\r\ncheaper. The demand will probably be less brisk. So we may suppose this\r\nwill be longer paying off than the domestic debt. With respect to the\r\nnew Government, nine or ten States will probably have accepted by the\r\nend of this month. The others may oppose it. Virginia, I think, will be\r\nof this number. Besides other objections of less moment, she will\r\ninsist on annexing a bill of rights to the new Constitution, _i. e._ a\r\nbill wherein the Government shall declare that, 1. Religion shall be\r\nfree; 2. Printing presses free; 3. Trials by jury preserved in all\r\ncases; 4. No monopolies in commerce; 5. No standing army. Upon\r\nreceiving this bill of rights, she will probably depart from her other\r\nobjections; and this bill is so much to the interest of all the States,\r\nthat I presume they will offer it, and thus our Constitution be\r\namended, and our Union closed by the end of the present year. In this\r\nway, there will have been opposition enough to do good, and not enough\r\nto do harm. I have such reliance on the good sense of the body of the\r\npeople, and the honesty of their leaders, that I am not afraid of their\r\nletting things go wrong to any length in any cause. Wishing you better\r\nhealth, and much happiness, I have the honor to be, with sentiments of\r\nthe most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE BERTROUS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Feb. 21, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of the letter you did me the\r\nhonor to write me on the 21st of January, together with the book on the\r\nculture of the olive tree. This is a precious present to me, and I pray\r\nyou to accept my thanks for it. I am just gratified by letters from\r\nSouth Carolina, which inform me that in consequence of the information\r\nI had given them on the subject of the olive tree, and the probability\r\nof its succeeding with them, several rich individuals propose to begin\r\nits culture there. This will not interfere with the commerce of France,\r\nbecause she imports much more oil than she exports, and because the\r\nconsumption of oil in the United States at present, is so\r\ninconsiderable, that should their demand be totally withdrawn at the\r\nEuropean market, and supplied at home, it will produce no sensible\r\neffect in Europe. We can never produce that article in very great\r\nquantity, because it happens that in our two southernmost States, where\r\nonly the climate is adapted to the olive, the soil is so generally rich\r\nas to be unfit for that tree, and proper for other productions of more\r\nimmediate profit. I am to thank you, also, for the raisins of Smyrna,\r\nwithout seed, which I received from you through Mr. Grand. * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR TROUCHIN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, February 26, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I should with great cheerfulness have done anything I could for\r\nthe manufacturers of Bourges, had anything been in my power. To this I\r\nshould have been induced by justice to them, and a desire to serve\r\nwhomsoever you befriend. This company is part of a great mass of\r\ncreditors to whom the United States contracted debts during the late\r\nwar. Those States, like others, are not able to pay immediately all the\r\ndebts which the war brought on them; but they are proceeding rapidly in\r\nthat payment, and will, perhaps, get through it more speedily than any\r\nnation ever did before.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen in the public papers the progress they are making in\r\nthis matter. They proceed in this by fixed rules, from which it is\r\ntheir principle never to depart in any instance, nor to do on any\r\naccount for any one person what they will not be able to do for all\r\nothers claiming on the same grounds. This company should engage the\r\nFrench Consul, or some other person on the spot, to be always ready to\r\npresent their claim whenever anything can be received on it, according\r\nto the order of payment established by Congress. I suppose that the\r\ninterest might have been annually received. With respect to what they\r\ncall the reduction of the debt from its nominal sum, it is not a\r\nreduction of it, but an appreciation at its true value. The public\r\neffects of the United States, such as their paper bills of credit, loan\r\noffice bills, etc., were a commodity which varied its value from time\r\nto time. A scale of their value for every month has been settled\r\naccording to what they sold for at market, in silver or gold. This\r\nvalue in gold or silver, with an interest of six per cent. annually\r\ntill payment, is what the United States pay. This they are able to pay;\r\nbut were they to propose to pay off all their paper, not according to\r\nwhat it cost the holder, in gold or silver, but according to the sum\r\nnamed in it, their whole country, if sold, and all their persons into\r\nthe bargain, might not suffice. They would, in this case, make a\r\nbankruptcy where none exists, as an individual, who being very able to\r\npay the real debts he has contracted, would undertake to give to every\r\nman fifty times as much as he had received from him. The company will\r\nreceive the market value of the public effects they have on their\r\nhands, and six per cent. per annum on that; and I can only repeat my\r\nadvice to them, to appoint some friend on the spot to act for them\r\nwhenever anything can be received. I have the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nPARIS, March 2, 1788.--Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received this day, a letter from Mrs. Adams, of the 26th\r\nultimo, informing me you would set out on the 29th, for the Hague. Our\r\naffairs at Amsterdam press on my mind like a mountain. I have no\r\ninformation to go on, but that of Willincks and Van Staphorsts, and\r\naccording to that, something seems necessary to be done. I am so\r\nanxious to confer with you on this subject, and to see you and them\r\ntogether, and get some effectual arrangement made in time, that I\r\ndetermine to meet you at the Hague. I will set out the moment some\r\nrepairs are made to my carriage; it is promised me at three o'clock\r\nto-morrow; but probably they will make it night, and that I may not set\r\nout till Tuesday morning. In that case, I shall be at the Hague on\r\nFriday night; in the meantime, you will perhaps have made all your bows\r\nthere. I am sensible how irksome this must be to you, in the moment of\r\nyour departure. But it is a great interest of the United States which\r\nis at stake, and I am sure you will sacrifice to that, your feelings\r\nand your interest. I hope to shake you by the hand, within twenty-four\r\nhours after you receive this; and in the meantime, I am, with much\r\nesteem and respect, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nAMSTERDAM, March 13, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--Mr. Adams having announced to our bankers here his approaching\r\ndeparture from Europe, and referred them to me for counsel on our\r\naffairs in their hands, they sent me a state of them, and of the\r\ndifficulties which were pressing at the moment, and impending more\r\nseriously for the month of June. They were urging me by almost every\r\npost on this subject. In this situation, information of Mr. Adams'\r\njourney of leave to the Hague reached me on the day of his arrival\r\nthere. I was sensible how important it was to have the benefit of his\r\ninterference in a department which had been his peculiarly from the\r\nbeginning, and with all the details of which he was as intimately\r\nacquainted as I was little so. I set out therefore in the instant,\r\njoined him at the Hague, and he readily concurred with me in the\r\nnecessity of our coming here to confer with our bankers on the measures\r\nwhich might be proper and practicable. We are now engaged on this\r\nsubject, and the result, together with a full explanation of the\r\ndifficulties which commanded our attention, shall be the subject of a\r\nletter which I shall do myself the honor of writing you by Mr. Adams,\r\nto be forwarded by Colonel Smith, who will go in the English packet. I\r\navoid further particulars in the present letter, because it is to pass\r\nthrough the different post-offices to Paris. It will be forwarded\r\nthence by Mr. Short, whom I have desired to do himself the honor of\r\nwriting to you any occurrences since my departure, which may be worthy\r\nof being communicated, by the French packet of this month. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect and esteem,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\nAMSTERDAM, March 16, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--In a letter of the 13th instant, which I had the honor of\r\naddressing you from this place, I mentioned in general terms, the\r\nobject of my journey hither, and that I should enter into more\r\nparticular details, by the confidential conveyance which would occur\r\nthrough Mr. Adams and Colonel Smith.\r\n\r\nThe board of treasury had, in the month of December, informed me and\r\nour bankers here, that it would be impossible for them to make any\r\nremittances to Europe for the then ensuing year, and that they must,\r\ntherefore, rely altogether on the progress of the late loan. But this,\r\nin the meantime, after being about one-third filled, had ceased to get\r\nforward. The bankers who had been referred to me for advice by Mr.\r\nAdams, stated those circumstances, and pressed their apprehension for\r\nthe ensuing month of June, when two hundred and seventy thousand\r\nflorins would be wanting for interest. In fine, they urged an offer of\r\nthe holders of the former bonds to take all those remaining on hand,\r\nprovided they might receive out of them the interest on a part of our\r\ndomestic debt, of which they had also become the holders. This would\r\nhave been one hundred and eighty thousand florins. To this proposition\r\nI could not presume any authority to listen. Thus pressed between the\r\ndanger of failure on one hand, and this proposition on the other, I\r\nheard of Mr. Adams being gone to the Hague, to take leave. His\r\nknowledge of the subject was too valuable to be neglected under the\r\npresent difficulty, and it was the last moment in which we could be\r\navailed of it. I set out immediately, therefore, for the Hague, and we\r\ncame on to this place together, in order to see what could be done. It\r\nwas easier to discover, than to remove, the causes which obstructed the\r\nprogress of the loan. Our affairs here, like those of other nations,\r\nare in the hands of particular bankers. These employ particular, and\r\nthey have their particular circle of money lenders. These money\r\nlenders, as I have before mentioned, while placing a part of their\r\nmoney in our foreign loans, had at the same time employed another part\r\nin a joint speculation, to the amount of eight hundred and forty\r\nthousand dollars, in our domestic debt. A year's interest was becoming\r\ndue on this, and they wished to avail themselves of our want of money\r\nfor the foreign interest, to obtain payment of the domestic. Our first\r\nobject was to convince our bankers, that there was no power on this\r\nside the Atlantic which could accede to this proposition, or give it\r\nany countenance. They at length, therefore, but with difficulty,\r\nreceded from this ground, and agreed to enter into conferences with the\r\nbrokers and lenders, and to use every exertion to clear the loan from\r\nthe embarrassment in which this speculation had engaged it. What will\r\nbe the result of these conferences, is not yet known. We have hopes,\r\nhowever, that it is not desperate, because the bankers consented\r\nyesterday to pay off the capital of fifty-one thousand florins, which\r\nhad become due on the first day of January, and which had not yet been\r\npaid. We have gone still further. The treasury-board gives no hope of\r\nremittances, till the new government can procure them. For that\r\ngovernment to be adopted, its legislature assembled, its system of\r\ntaxation and collection arranged, the money gathered from the people\r\ninto the treasury, and then remitted to Europe, must extend\r\nconsiderably into the year 1790. To secure our credit then, for the\r\npresent year only, is but to put off the evil day to the next. What\r\nremains of the last loan, when it shall be filled up, will little more\r\nthan clear us of present demands, as may be seen by the estimate\r\nenclosed. We thought it better, therefore, to provide at once for the\r\nyears 1789 and 1790, also; and thus to place the Government at its\r\nease, and her credit in security, during that trying interval. The same\r\nestimate will show, that another million of florins will be necessary\r\nto effect this. We stated this to our bankers, who concurred in our\r\nviews, and that to ask the whole sum at once, would be better than to\r\nmake demands from time to time so small, as that they betray to the\r\nmoney holders the extreme feebleness of our resources. Mr. Adams,\r\ntherefore, has executed bonds for another million of florins; which,\r\nhowever, are to remain unissued till Congress shall have ratified the\r\nmeasure; so that this transaction is something or nothing, at their\r\npleasure. We suppose its expediency so apparent, as to leave little\r\ndoubt of its ratification. In this case, much time will have been saved\r\nby the execution of the bonds at this moment, and the proposition will\r\nbe presented under a more favorable appearance, according to the\r\nopinion of the bankers. Mr. Adams is under a necessity of setting out\r\nto-morrow morning, but I shall stay two or three days longer, to attend\r\nto and encourage the efforts of the bankers; though it is yet doubtful\r\nwhether they will ensure us a safe passage over the month of June. Not\r\nhaving my letters here to turn to, I am unable to say whether the last\r\nI wrote mentioned the declaration of the Emperor that he should take\r\npart in the war against the Turks. This declaration appeared a little\r\nbefore, or a little after that letter, I do not recollect which. Some\r\nlittle hostilities have taken place between them. The court of\r\nVersailles seems to pursue immovably its pacific system, and from every\r\nappearance in the country from which I write, we must conclude that its\r\ntragedy is wound up. The triumph appears complete, and tranquillity\r\nperfectly established. The numbers who have emigrated are differently\r\nestimated, from twenty to forty thousand.\r\n\r\nA little before I left Paris, I received a piece of intelligence, which\r\nshould be communicated, leaving you to lay what stress on it, it may\r\nseem to deserve. Its authenticity may be surely relied on. At the time\r\nof the late pacification, Spain had about fifteen ships of the line\r\nnearly ready for sea. The convention for disarming did not extend to\r\nher, nor did she disarm. This gave inquietude to the court of London,\r\nand they demanded an explanation. One was given, they say, which is\r\nperfectly satisfactory. The Russian Minister at Versailles, getting\r\nknowledge of this, became suspicious on his part. He recollected that\r\nSpain, during the late war, had been opposed to the entrance of a\r\nRussian fleet into the Mediterranean, and concluded if England was not\r\nthe object of this armament, Russia might be. It is known that that\r\npower means to send a fleet of about twenty-four ships into the\r\nMediterranean this summer. He sent to the Count de Montmorin, and\r\nexpressed his apprehensions. The Count de Montmorin declared that the\r\nobject of Spain in that armament, was totally different; that he was\r\nnot sure she would succeed; but that France and Spain were to be\r\nconsidered as one, and that the former would become guarantee for the\r\nlatter; that she would make no opposition to the Russian fleet. If\r\nneither England nor Russia be the object, the question recurs, who is\r\nit for? You know best if our affairs with Spain are in a situation to\r\ngive jealousy to either of us. I think it very possible that the\r\nsatisfaction of the court of London may have been pretended, or\r\npremature. It is possible, also, that the affairs of Spain in South\r\nAmerica, may require them to assume a threatening appearance. I give\r\nyou the facts, however, and you will judge whether they are objects of\r\nattention or of mere curiosity.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of sincere esteem and respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I enclose herewith an extract of a letter from the Count de\r\nVergennes to the French Ambassador at the Hague, which will make a\r\nremarkable chapter in the history of the late revolution here. It is\r\nnot public, nor should be made so by us. Probably those who have been\r\nthe victims of it, will some day publish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\nAMSTERDAM, March 29, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the 14th,\r\n18th and 23d instant. I would have preferred doing it in person, but\r\nthe season, and the desire of seeing what I have not yet seen, invite\r\nme to take the route of the Rhine, I shall leave this place to-morrow\r\nmorning, and probably not reach Paris till the latter end of April. In\r\nthe moment we were to have conferred on the subject of paying the\r\narrears due to you, a letter of the 20th of February from the Board of\r\nTreasury was received, forbidding the application of money to any\r\npurpose, (except our current claims,) till the June interest should be\r\nactually in hand. Being by the letter tied up from giving an order in\r\nyour favor, I return you the letter you had written to Mr. Jay, on the\r\nsupposition that the order for your arrears was given. It has been\r\nsuggested, however, that if you could receive bonds of the loan, you\r\ncould make them answer your purpose, and the commissioners say this\r\nwould in no wise interfere with the views of the treasury board, nor\r\nthe provision for the June interest. I have, therefore, recommended to\r\nthem in writing, to give you bonds to the amount of your balance, if\r\nyou choose to take them, rather than to wait. I wish this may answer\r\nyour purpose. I remember that in the conversation which I had the honor\r\nof having with you, on the evening I was at the Hague, you said that\r\nyour enemies had endeavored to have it believed that Congress would\r\nabandon you, and withdraw your appointments. An enemy generally says\r\nand believes what he wishes, and your enemies particularly, are not\r\nthose who are most in the councils of Congress, nor the best qualified\r\nto tell what Congress will do. From the evidences you have received of\r\ntheir approbation, and from their well-known steadiness and justice,\r\nyou must be assured of a continuance of their favor, were they to\r\ncontinue under the present form. Nor do I see anything in the new\r\ngovernment which threatens us with less firmness. The Senate, who will\r\nmake and remove their foreign officers, must, from its constitution, be\r\na wise and steady body. Nor would a new government begin its\r\nadministration by discarding old servants; servants who have put all to\r\nthe risk, and when the risk was great, to obtain that freedom and\r\nsecurity under which themselves will be what they shall be. Upon the\r\nwhole, my dear Sir, tranquillize yourself and your family upon this\r\nsubject. All the evidence which exists as yet, authorizes you to do\r\nthis, nor can I foresee any cause of disquiet in future. That none may\r\narise, that yourself and family may enjoy health, happiness, and the\r\ncontinued approbation of those by whom you wish most to be approved, is\r\nthe sincere wish of him, who has the honor to be, with sentiments of\r\nsincere esteem and attachment, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nAMSTERDAM, March 29, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN, * * * * * *\r\n\r\nI cannot close my letter without some observations on the transfer of\r\nour domestic debt to foreigners. This circumstance and the failure to\r\npay off Fiseaux' loan, were the sole causes of the stagnation of our\r\nlate loan. For otherwise, our credit would have stood on more hopeful\r\ngrounds than heretofore. There was a condition in the last loan, that\r\nthe lenders furnished one-third of the money, the remaining two-thirds\r\nof the bonds should remain eighteen months unsold, and at their option\r\nto take or not, and that in the meantime the same bankers should open\r\nno other loan for us. These same lenders became purchasers of our\r\ndomestic debt, and they were disposed to avail themselves of the power\r\nthey had thus acquired over us as to our foreign demands, to make us\r\npay the domestic one. Should the present necessities have obliged you\r\nto comply with their proposition for the present year, I should be of\r\nopinion it ought to be the last instance. If the transfer of these\r\ndebts to Europe, meet with any encouragement from us, we can no more\r\nborrow money here, let our necessities be what they will. For who will\r\ngive ninety-six per cent. for the foreign obligations of the same\r\nnation, whose domestic ones can be bought at the same market for\r\nfifty-five per cent.; the former, too, bearing an interest of only five\r\nper cent., while the latter yields six. If any discouragements can be\r\nhonestly thrown on this transfer, it would seem advisable, in order to\r\nkeep the domestic debt at home. It would be a very effectual one, if,\r\ninstead of the title existing in our treasury books alone, it was made\r\nto exist in loose papers, as our loan office debts do. The European\r\nholder would then be obliged to risk the title paper of his capital, as\r\nwell as his interest, in the hands of his agents in America, whenever\r\nthe interest was to be demanded; whereas, at present, he trusts him\r\nwith the interest only. This single circumstance would put a total stop\r\nto all future sales of domestic debt at this market. Whether this, or\r\nany other obstruction, can or should be thrown in the way of these\r\noperations, is not for me to decide; but I have thought the subject\r\nworthy your consideration.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\nAMSTERDAM, March 29, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received from you three letters of March the 9th,\r\n14th, and 17th, and written you two of the 10th and 13th. In the last,\r\nI mentioned to you that I should leave this place the 13th but I have\r\nbeen drawn on from day to day by the hope of seeing the business on\r\nwhich I came settled, on the basis of positive engagement, and the\r\ngreat object of the month of June appeared so sure, that we were about\r\nproceeding to immediate payment of Mr. Grand, the State of Virginia,\r\nand all smaller claims, when a letter of the 20th February, from the\r\nCommissioners of the Treasury, arrived, forbidding the application of\r\nmoney to any object except the diplomatic expenses, till the cash for\r\nthe June interest was actually in hand. No room was left for the\r\nbankers to execute their discretion. The consequence is a delay of all\r\nother objects for some weeks, which probably might have been effected\r\ninstantly, without danger to the great one. Indeed, I had obtained a\r\npositive engagement on that ground. Be so good as to communicate this\r\nmuch to Mr. Grand.\r\n\r\nA letter from Mr. Van Berkel, at New York, confirms the arrival of the\r\nCount de Moustier there on the 18th of January, and removes all\r\nsuspense and anxiety on that subject. You know we received a similar\r\naccount the day before I left Paris, which I communicated to M. de\r\nMontmorin. It is with infinite affliction that I recollect, in the\r\nhurry of my departure, to have omitted to have notified the same to M.\r\nDupont, who had a son embarked in the same bottom. I am haunted with\r\nthis recollection, and would beg either yourself or Mr. Grand,\r\nwhichever sees M. Dupont first, to let him know that it was neither\r\nwant of attention nor attachment to him which occasioned it to escape\r\nme, but the confusion which attended the setting out on such a journey\r\non so short notice.\r\n\r\nI set out to-morrow for Utrecht, Nimeguen, etc., and shall pursue the\r\ncourse of the Rhine as far as the roads will permit me, not exceeding\r\nStrasburg. Whenever they become impassable, or too difficult, if they\r\ndo become so, I shall turn off to Paris. So also if anything of\r\nimportance should call for me at Paris sooner, you will be so good as\r\nto address to me at Frankfort and Strasburg. I will call at the post\r\noffice there, and be happy to find news from you relative to yourself,\r\nmy daughters, and America. I shall be at Frankfort about the 8th of\r\nApril, and at Strasburg about the 15th. You shall hear from me on the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, May 2, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am honored with your Excellency's letter by the last\r\npacket, and thank you for the information it contains on the\r\ncommunication between the Cayahoga and Big Beaver. I have ever\r\nconsidered the opening a canal between those two water courses as the\r\nmost important work in that line which the State of Virginia could\r\nundertake. It will infallibly turn through the Potomac all the commerce\r\nof Lake Erie, and the country west of that, except what may pass down\r\nthe Mississippi; and it is important that it be soon done, lest that\r\ncommerce should, in the meantime, get established in another channel.\r\nHaving, in the spring of the last year, taken a journey through the\r\nsouthern parts of France, and particularly examined the canal of\r\nLanguedoc, through its whole course, I take the liberty of sending you\r\nthe notes I made on the spot, as you may find in them something,\r\nperhaps, which may be turned to account, some time or other, in the\r\nprosecution of the Potomac canal. Being merely a copy from my\r\ntravelling notes, they are undigested and imperfect, but may still\r\nperhaps give hints capable of improvement in your mind.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Europe are in such a state still, that it is impossible\r\nto say what form they will take ultimately. France and Prussia, viewing\r\nthe Emperor as their most dangerous and common enemy, had heretofore\r\nseen their common safety as depending on a strict connection with one\r\nanother. This had naturally inclined the Emperor to the scale of\r\nEngland, and the Empress also, as having views in common with the\r\nEmperor, against the Turks. But these two powers would, at any time,\r\nhave gladly quitted England, to coalesce with France, as being the\r\npower which they met everywhere, opposed as a barrier to all their\r\nschemes of aggrandisement. When, therefore, the present King of Prussia\r\ntook the eccentric measure of bidding defiance to France, by placing\r\nhis brother in law on the throne of Holland, the two empires\r\nimmediately seized the occasion of soliciting an alliance with France.\r\nThe motives for this appeared so plausible, that it was believed the\r\nlatter would have entered into this alliance, and that thus, the whole\r\npolitical system of Europe would have taken a new form. What has\r\nprevented this court from coming into it, we know not. The unmeasurable\r\nambition of the Emperor, and his total want of moral principle and\r\nhonor, are suspected. A great share of Turkey, the recovery of Silesia,\r\nthe consolidation of his dominions by the Bavarian exchange, the\r\nliberties of the Germanic body, all occupy his mind together, and his\r\nhead is not well enough organized, to pursue so much only of all this\r\nas is practicable. Still, it was thought that France might safely have\r\ncoalesced with these powers, because Russia and herself, holding close\r\ntogether, as their interests would naturally dictate, the Emperor could\r\nnever stir but with their permission. France seems, however, to have\r\ntaken the worst of all parties, that is, none at all. She folds her\r\narms, lets the two empires go to work to cut up Turkey as they can, and\r\nholds Prussia aloof, neither as a friend nor foe. This is withdrawing\r\nher opposition from the two empires, without the benefit of any\r\ncondition whatever. In the meantime, England has clearly overreached\r\nherself. She excited the war between the Russians and Turks, in hopes\r\nthat France, still supporting the Turks, would be embarrassed with the\r\ntwo empires. She did not foresee the event which has taken place, of\r\nFrance abandoning the Turks, and that which may take place, of her\r\nunion with the two empires. She allied herself with Holland, but cannot\r\nobtain the alliance of Prussia. This latter power would be very glad to\r\nclose again the breach with France, and, therefore, while there remains\r\nan opening for this, holds off from England, whose fleets could not\r\nenter into Silesia, to protect that from the Emperor. Thus, you see,\r\nthat the old system is unhinged, and no new one hung in its place.\r\nProbabilities are rather in favor of a connection between the two\r\nempires, France and Spain. Several symptoms show themselves, of\r\nfriendly dispositions between Russia and France, unfriendly ones\r\nbetween Russia and England, and such as are barely short of hostility\r\nbetween England and France. But into real hostilities, this country\r\nwould with difficulty be drawn. Her finances are too deranged, her\r\ninternal union too much dissolved, to hazard a war. The nation is\r\npressing on fast to a fixed constitution. Such a revolution in the\r\npublic opinion has taken place, that the crown already feels its powers\r\nbounded, and is obliged, by its measures, to acknowledge limits. A\r\nStates General will be called at some epoch not distant; they will\r\nprobably establish a civil list, and leave the government to temporary\r\nprovisions of money, so as to render frequent assemblies of the\r\nnational representative necessary. How that representative will be\r\norganized is yet uncertain. Among a thousand projects, the best seems\r\nto me, that of dividing them into two Houses, of Commons and Nobles;\r\nthe Commons to be chosen by the Provincial Assemblies, who are chosen\r\nthemselves by the people, and the Nobles by the body of Noblesse, as in\r\nScotland. But there is no reason to conjecture that this is the\r\nparticular scheme which will be preferred.\r\n\r\nThe war between the Russians and Turks, has made an opening for our\r\nCommodore Paul Jones. The Empress has invited him into her service. She\r\ninsures to him the rank of rear admiral; will give him a separate\r\ncommand, and, it is understood, that he is never to be commanded. I\r\nthink she means to oppose him to the Captain Pacha, on the Black Sea.\r\nHe is by this time, probably, at St. Petersburg. The circumstances did\r\nnot permit his awaiting the permission of Congress, because the season\r\nwas close at hand for opening the campaign. But he has made it a\r\ncondition, that he shall be free at all times to return to the orders\r\nof Congress, whenever they shall please to call for him; and also, that\r\nhe shall not in any case be expected to bear arms against France. I\r\nbelieve Congress had it in contemplation, to give him the grade of\r\nadmiral, from the date of his taking the Serapis. Such a measure now\r\nwould greatly gratify him, second the efforts of fortune in his favor,\r\nand better the opportunities of improving him for our service, whenever\r\nthe moment shall come in which we may want him.\r\n\r\nThe danger of our incurring something like a bankruptcy in Holland,\r\nwhich might have been long, and even fatally felt in a moment of\r\ncrisis, induced me to take advantage of Mr. Adams' journey to take\r\nleave at the Hague to meet him there, get him to go on to Amsterdam,\r\nand try to avert the impending danger. The moment of paying a great sum\r\nof annual interest was approaching. There was no money on hand, the\r\nboard of treasury had notified that they could not remit any; and the\r\nprogress of the loan which had been opened there, had absolutely\r\nstopped. Our bankers there gave me notice of all this; and that a\r\nsingle day's failure in the payment of interest would have the most\r\nfatal effect on our credit. I am happy to inform you we were able to\r\nset the loan a going again, and that the evil is at least postponed.\r\nIndeed, I am tolerably satisfied, that if the measures we proposed are\r\nratified by Congress, all European calls for money (except the French\r\ndebt) are secure enough, till the end of the year 1790; by which time,\r\nwe calculated that the new government might be able to get money into\r\ntheir treasury. Much conversation with the bankers, brokers and money\r\nholders, gave me insight into the state of national credit there, which\r\nI had never before been able satisfactorily to get. The English credit\r\nis the first, because they never open a loan, without laying and\r\nappropriating taxes for the payment of the interest, and there has\r\nnever been an instance of their failing one day, in that payment. The\r\nEmperor and Empress have good credit, because they use it little, and\r\nhave hitherto been very punctual. This country is among the lowest, in\r\npoint of credit. Ours stands in hope only. They consider us as the\r\nsurest nation on earth for the repayment of the capital; but as the\r\npunctual payment of interest is of absolute necessity in their\r\narrangements, we cannot borrow but with difficulty and disadvantage.\r\nThe moneyed men, however, look towards our new government with a great\r\ndegree of partiality, and even anxiety. If they see that set out on the\r\nEnglish plan, the first degree of credit will be transferred to us. A\r\nfavorable occasion will arise to our new government of asserting this\r\nground to themselves. The transfer of the French debt, public and\r\nprivate, to Amsterdam, is certainly desirable. An act of the new\r\ngovernment, therefore, for opening a loan in Holland for the purpose,\r\nlaying taxes at the same time, for paying annually the interest and a\r\npart of the principal, will answer the two valuable purposes, of\r\nascertaining the degree of our credit, and of removing those causes of\r\nbickering and irritation, which should never be permitted to subsist\r\nwith a nation, with which it is so much our interest to be on cordial\r\nterms as with France. A very small portion of this debt, I mean that\r\npart due to the French officers, has done us an injury, of which, those\r\nin office in America, cannot have an idea. The interest is unpaid for\r\nthe last three years; and these creditors, highly connected, and at the\r\nsame time needy, have felt and communicated hard thoughts of us.\r\nBorrowing, as we have done, three hundred thousand florins a year, to\r\npay our interest in Holland, it would have been worth while to have\r\nadded twenty thousand more to suppress those clamors. I am anxious\r\nabout everything which may affect our credit. My wish would be, to\r\npossess it in the highest degree, but to use it little. Were we without\r\ncredit, we might be crushed by a nation of much inferior resources, but\r\npossessing higher credit. The present system of war renders it\r\nnecessary to make exertions far beyond the annual resources of the\r\nState, and to consume in one year the efforts of many. And this system\r\nwe cannot change. It remains then, that we cultivate our credit with\r\nthe utmost attention.\r\n\r\nI had intended to have written a word to your Excellency on the subject\r\nof the new Constitution, but I have already spun out my letter to an\r\nimmoderate length. I will just observe, therefore, that according to my\r\nideas, there is a great deal of good in it. There are two things,\r\nhowever, which I dislike strongly. 1. The want of a declaration of\r\nrights. I am in hopes the opposition of Virginia will remedy this, and\r\nproduce such a declaration. 2. The perpetual re-eligibility of the\r\nPresident. This, I fear, will make that an office for life, first, and\r\nthen hereditary. I was much an enemy to monarchies before I came to\r\nEurope. I am ten thousand times more so, since I have seen what they\r\nare. There is scarcely an evil known in these countries, which may not\r\nbe traced to their king, as its source, nor a good, which is not\r\nderived from the small fibres of republicanism existing among them. I\r\ncan further say, with safety, there is not a crowned head in Europe,\r\nwhose talents or merits would entitle him to be elected a vestryman, by\r\nthe people of any parish in America. However, I shall hope, that before\r\nthere is danger of this change taking place in the office of President,\r\nthe good sense and free spirit of our countrymen, will make the changes\r\nnecessary to prevent it. Under this hope, I look forward to the general\r\nadoption of the new Constitution with anxiety, as necessary for us\r\nunder our present circumstances. I have so much trespassed on your\r\npatience already, by the length of this letter, that I will add nothing\r\nfurther, than those assurances of sincere esteem and attachment with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\nPARIS, May 3, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mine of February the 6th, acknowledged the receipt of yours\r\nof December the 9th and 20th; since that, those of February the 19th\r\nand 20th have come to hand. The present will be delivered to you by Mr.\r\nWarville, whom you will find truly estimable, and a great enthusiast\r\nfor liberty. His writings will have shown you this.\r\n\r\nFor public news, I must refer you to my letters to Mr. Jay. Those I\r\nwrote to him from Amsterdam will have informed you of my journey\r\nthither. While there, I endeavored to get, as well as I could, into the\r\nstate of national credit there; for though I am an enemy to the using\r\nour credit but under absolute necessity, yet the possessing a good\r\ncredit I consider as indispensable, in the present system of carrying\r\non war. The existence of a nation having no credit is always\r\nprecarious. The credit of England is the best. Their paper sells at par\r\non the exchange of Amsterdam the moment any of it is offered, and they\r\ncan command there any sum they please. The reason is, that they never\r\nborrow, without establishing taxes for the payment of the interest, and\r\nthey never yet failed one day in that payment. The Emperor and Empress\r\nhave good credit enough. They use it little and have been ever\r\npunctual. This country cannot borrow at all there; for though they\r\nalways pay their interest within the year, yet it is often some months\r\nbehind. It is difficult to assign to our credit its exact station in\r\nthis scale. They consider us as the most certain nation on earth for\r\nthe principal; but they see that we borrow of themselves to pay the\r\ninterest, so that this is only a conversion of their interest into\r\nprincipal. Our paper, for this reason, sells for from four to eight per\r\ncent. below par, on the exchange, and our loans are negotiated with the\r\nPatriots only. But the whole body of money dealers, Patriot and\r\nStadtholderian, look forward to our new government with a great degree\r\nof partiality and interest. They are disposed to have much confidence\r\nin it, and it was the prospect of its establishment, which enabled us\r\nto set the loan of last year into motion again. They will attend\r\nsteadfastly to its first money operations. If these are injudiciously\r\nbegun, correction, whenever they shall be corrected, will come too\r\nlate. Our borrowings will always be difficult and disadvantageous. If\r\nthey begin well, our credit will immediately take the first station.\r\nEqual provision for the interest, adding to it a certain prospect for\r\nthe principal, will give us a preference to all nations, the English\r\nnot excepted. The first act of the new government should be some\r\noperation, whereby they may assume to themselves this station. Their\r\nEuropean debts form a proper subject for this. Digest the whole, public\r\nand private, Dutch, French and Spanish, into a table, showing the sum\r\nof interest due every year, and the portions of principal payable the\r\nsame year. Take the most certain branch of revenue, and one which shall\r\nsuffice to pay the interest, and leave such a surplus as may accomplish\r\nall the payments of the capital, at terms somewhat short of those at\r\nwhich they will become due. Let the surplusses of those years, in which\r\nno reimbursement of principal falls, be applied to buy up our paper on\r\nthe exchange of Amsterdam, and thus anticipate the demands of\r\nprincipal. In this way, our paper will be kept up at par; and this\r\nalone will enable us to command in four and twenty hours, at any time,\r\non the exchange of Amsterdam, as many millions as that capital can\r\nproduce. The same act which makes this provision for the existing\r\ndebts, should go on to open a loan to their whole amount; the produce\r\nof that loan to be applied, as fast as received, to the payment of such\r\nparts of the existing debts as admit of payment. The rate of interest\r\nto be as the government should privately instruct their agent, because\r\nit must depend on the effect these measures would have on the exchange.\r\nProbably it could be lowered from time to time. Honest and annual\r\npublications of the payments made will inspire confidence, while\r\nsilence would conceal nothing from those interested to know.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the _compte rendu_ which I send you, that this\r\ncountry now calls seriously for its interest at least. The non-payment\r\nof this, hitherto, has done our credit little injury, because the\r\ngovernment here, saying nothing about it, the public have supposed they\r\nwished to leave us at our ease as to the payment. It is now seen that\r\nthey call for it, and they will publish annually the effect of that\r\ncall. A failure here, therefore, will have the same effect on our\r\ncredit hereafter, as a failure at Amsterdam. I consider it then, as of\r\na necessity not to be dispensed with, that these calls be effectually\r\nprovided for. If it shall be seen that the general provision, before\r\nhinted at, cannot be in time, then it is the present Government which\r\nshould take on itself to borrow in Amsterdam, what may be necessary.\r\nThe new Government should by no means be left by the old, to the\r\nnecessity of borrowing a stiver, before it can tax for its interest.\r\nThis will be to destroy the credit of the new Government in its birth.\r\nAnd I am of opinion, that if the present Congress will add to the loan\r\nof a million (which Mr. Adams and myself have proposed this year) what\r\nmay be necessary for the French calls to the year 1790, the money can\r\nbe obtained at the usual disadvantage. Though I have not, at this\r\nmoment, received such authentic information from our bankers as I may\r\ncommunicate to Congress, yet I know privately from one of them, (Mr.\r\nJacob Van Staphorst, who is here,) that they had on hand a fortnight\r\nago, four hundred thousand florins, and the sale going on well. So that\r\nthe June interest, which had been in so critical a predicament, was\r\nalready secured. If the loan of a million on Mr. Adams' bonds of this\r\nyear, be ratified by Congress, the applications of the money on hand\r\nmay go on immediately, according to the statement I sent to Mr. Jay.\r\nOne article in this, I must beg you to press on the treasury board;\r\nthat is, an immediate order for the payment of the three years'\r\narrearages to the French officers. They were about holding a meeting to\r\ntake desperate measures on this subject, when I was called to Holland.\r\nI desired them to be quiet till my return, and since my return, I have\r\npressed a further tranquillity till July, by which time, I have given\r\nthem reason to hope I may have an answer from the treasury board, to my\r\nletters of March. Their ill humor can be contained no longer, and as I\r\nknow no reason why they may not be paid at that time, I shall have\r\nnothing to urge in our defence after that.\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nYou remember the report, drawn by Governor Randolph, on the navigation\r\nof the Mississippi. When I came to Europe, Mr. Thompson was so kind as\r\nto have me a copy of it made out. I lent it to Dr. Franklin, and he\r\nmislaid it, so that it could never be found. Could you make interest\r\nwith him to have me another copy made, and send it to me? By Mr.\r\nWarville I send your pedometer. To the loop at the bottom of it, you\r\nmust sew a tape, and at the other end of the tape, a small hook, (such\r\nas we use under the name of hooks and eyes) cut a little hole in the\r\nbottom of your left watch pocket, pass the hook and tape through it,\r\nand down between the breeches and drawers, and fix the hook on the edge\r\nof your knee band, an inch from the knee buckle; then hook the\r\ninstrument itself by its swivel hook, on the upper edge of the watch\r\npocket. Your tape being well adjusted in length, your double steps will\r\nbe exactly counted by the instrument, the shortest hand pointing out\r\nthe thousands, the flat hand the hundreds, and the long hand the tens\r\nand units. Never turn the hands backward; indeed, it is best not to set\r\nthem to any given place, but to note the number they stand at when you\r\nbegin to walk. The adjusting the tape to its exact length is a critical\r\nbusiness, and will cost you many trials. But once done, it is done for\r\never. The best way is, to have a small buckle fixed on the middle of\r\nthe tape, by which you can take it up, and let it out at pleasure. When\r\nyou choose it should cease to count, unhook it from the top of the\r\nwatch pocket, and let it fall down to the bottom of the pocket.\r\n\r\n                 *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of the most sincere esteem and attachment, dear\r\nSir your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Humphreys\r\n\r\n(1752-1818)\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Humphreys fought through the Revolutionary War, and early in 1780\r\nwas selected as aide to General Washington with the rank of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel. Having particularly distinguished himself at the\r\nsiege of York, Congress voted him a handsome sword. In July, 1784, he\r\nwent to France as Secretary of Legation to Thomas Jefferson. In 1790 he\r\nwas appointed Minister to Portugal, and in 1797 accepted the office of\r\nMinister to Spain, continuing at that post till 1802, after concluding\r\ntreaties with Tripoli and Algiers. In 1812 he took command of the\r\nmilitia of Connecticut, and as a member of the Legislature was active\r\nin reorganizing for the local defence. A collection of his writings was\r\npublished in 1804.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Jay\r\n\r\n(1745-1829)\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Jay was sent in 1774 as a delegate to the first Congress, and took\r\na leading part in its proceedings. He drew up the 'Address to the\r\nPeople of Great Britain, and wrote the address issued by Congress in\r\n1775 to the people of Canada. He was a leading member of the New York\r\nConvention, serving on the most important committees, and actively\r\nengaged in repelling invasions and suppressing Tory combinations. He\r\nhad a chief share in framing the Constitution of New York and in May,\r\n1777, was appointed Chief Justice of New York. From December 1778 to\r\nSeptember, 1779 he was again a member of Congress. He was then\r\nappointed Minister to Spain and with Adams, Franklin and others, signed\r\nthe treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain on\r\nSeptember 3, 1783. In 1787 he united with Hamilton and Madison in\r\nwriting \"The Federalist\" to answer objections to the proposed Federal\r\nConstitution, and contributed powerfully to its adoption. In 1788 he\r\nwas appointed Chief Justice of the United States, and from 1795 to 1801\r\nwas Governor of New York.",
