There is no branch of our government in\r\nwhich all our people are so deeply interested as the Navy of the\r\nUnited States. It is not merely San Francisco, not merely New York, or\r\nBoston, or Charleston, or New Orleans, not merely the seacoast cities\r\nof the Nation; every individual in the Nation who is proud of America\r\nand jealous of her good name must feel a thrill of generous emotion\r\nat the erection of a monument to the navy, a monument to the fleet\r\nwhich was victorious under Admiral Dewey on the first of May five\r\nyears ago, a fleet which then added a new page to the long honor roll\r\nof American achievement. It is eminently fitting that there should be\r\nhere in this great city on the Pacific Ocean a monument to commemorate\r\nthe deed which showed once for all that America had taken her position\r\non the Pacific. I want you all to draw a practical lesson from this\r\ncommemoration. We to-day dedicate this monument because those who\r\nwent before us had the wisdom to make ready for the victory. If we\r\nwish our children to have the chance of dedicating monuments of this\r\nkind in the event of war we must see that the navy is made ready in\r\nadvance. To dedicate the monument would be an empty and foolish thing\r\nif we accompanied it by an abandonment of our national policy of\r\nbuilding up the navy. And good though it is to erect this monument, it\r\nis better still to go on with the building up of the navy which gave\r\nthe monument to us, and which, if we ever give it a fair chance, can\r\nbe relied upon to rise level to our needs.\r\n\r\nRemember that after the war has begun it is too late to improvise\r\na navy. A naval war is two-thirds settled in advance, at least\r\ntwo-thirds, because it is mainly settled by the preparation which has\r\ngone on for years preceding its outbreak. We won at Manila because the\r\nshipbuilders of the country, including those here at San Francisco,\r\nunder the wise provisions of Congress, had for fifteen years before\r\nbeen preparing the navy. In 1882 our navy was a shame and a disgrace\r\nto the country in point of material. The personnel contained as fine\r\nmaterial as there was to be found in the world but the ships and the\r\nguns were antiquated, and it would have been a wicked absurdity to\r\nhave sent them against the ships of any good power. Then we began to\r\nbuild up the navy. Every ship that fought under Dewey had been built\r\nbetween 1883 and 1896.\r\n\r\nWe come here as patriots remembering that our party lines stop at the\r\nwater’s edge. That fleet was successful in 1898 because under the\r\nprevious administrations of both political parties, under the previous\r\nCongresses controlled by both political parties, for the previous\r\nfifteen years there had been a resolute effort to build adequate\r\nships. The ships that went in under Dewey had been constructed under\r\ndifferent successive Secretaries of the Navy and had been provided for\r\nby different successive Congresses of the United States. Not one of\r\nthem had been built less than two years, some of them fourteen years.\r\nWe could not have begun to fight that battle if we had not been for so\r\nmany years making ready the navy.\r\n\r\nThe last Congress has taken greater strides than any previous Congress\r\nin making ready the navy, but it will be two or three years before the\r\neffects are seen. In no branch of the government are foresight and the\r\ncarrying out of a steady and continuous policy so necessary as in the\r\nnavy; and you, citizens of San Francisco, of California, and all our\r\ncitizens should make it a matter of prime duty to see that there is\r\nno halt in that work, that the next Congress, and the Congress after\r\nthat, and the Congress after that, go right on providing formidable\r\nwarcraft, providing officers, providing men, and providing the means\r\nof training them in peace to be effective in war. The best ships and\r\nthe best guns do not count unless they are handled aright and aimed\r\naright, and the best men can not thus handle the one nor aim the other\r\nif they do not have ample practice. Our people must be trained in\r\nhandling our ships in squadrons on the high seas. Our people on the\r\nships must be trained by actual practice to do their duty in conning\r\ntower, in the engine-rooms, in the gun-turrets. The shots that count\r\nin battle are the shots that hit.\r\n\r\nWe have reason to be satisfied with the rapid increase in accuracy\r\nin marksmanship of the navy in recent years, and I congratulate\r\nAdmiral Glass and those under him and all our naval officers who are\r\ntaking their part so well in perfecting that work, and I congratulate\r\nthe enlisted men of the navy upon the extraordinary improvement in\r\nmarksmanship shown by the gun pointers.\r\n\r\nApplaud the navy and what it has done. That is first-class. But make\r\nyour applause count by seeing that the good work goes on. Besides\r\napplauding now see to it that the navy is so built up that the men of\r\nthe next generation will have something to applaud also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY, CAL., MAY 14, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_President Wheeler; Fellow-Members of the University_:\r\n\r\nLast night, in speaking to one of my new friends in California, he\r\ntold me that he thought enough had been said to me about the fruits\r\nand flowers; that enough had been said to me about California being an\r\nEden, and that he wished I would pay some attention to Adam as well.\r\nMuch though I have been interested in the wonderful physical beauty of\r\nthis wonderful State, I have been infinitely more interested in its\r\ncitizenship, and perhaps most in its citizenship in the making.\r\n\r\nWhen I come to the University of California and am greeted by its\r\nPresident I am greeted by an old and valued friend, a friend whom I\r\nhave not merely known socially but upon whom, while I was Governor of\r\nNew York, I leaned often for advice and assistance in the problems\r\nwith which I had to deal. When he accepted your offer I grudged him\r\nto you. And it was not until I came here, not until I have seen you,\r\nthat I have been fully reconciled to the loss. But now I am, for I can\r\nconceive of no happier life for any man to lead to whom life means\r\nwhat it should mean, than the life of the President of this great\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nThis same friend last night suggested to me a thought that I intend\r\nto work out in speaking to you to-day. We were talking over the\r\nUniversity of California, and from that we spoke of the general\r\neducational system of our country. Facts tend to become commonplace,\r\nand we tend to lose sight of their importance when once they are\r\ningrained into the life of the Nation. Although we talk a good deal\r\nabout what the widespread education of this country means, I question\r\nif many of us deeply consider its meaning. From the lowest grade\r\nof the public school to the highest form of university training,\r\neducation in this country is at the disposal of every man, every\r\nwoman, who chooses to work for and obtain it. The State has done much,\r\nvery much; witness this university. Private benefaction has done\r\nvery much; witness also this university. And each one of us who has\r\nobtained an education has obtained something for which he or she has\r\nnot personally paid. No matter what the school, what the university,\r\nevery American who has a school training, a university training, has\r\nobtained something given to him outright by the State, or given to him\r\nby those dead or those living who were able to make provision for that\r\ntraining because of the protection of the State, because of existence\r\nwithin its borders. Each one of us then who has an education, school\r\nor college, has obtained something from the community at large for\r\nwhich he or she has not paid, and no self-respecting man or woman\r\nis content to rest permanently under such an obligation. Where the\r\nState has bestowed education the man who accepts it must be content\r\nto accept it merely as a charity unless he returns it to the State in\r\nfull, in the shape of good citizenship. I do not ask of you, men and\r\nwomen here to-day, good citizenship as a favor to the State. I demand\r\nit of you as a right, and hold you recreant to your duty if you fail\r\nto give it.\r\n\r\nHere you are in this university, in this State with its wonderful\r\nclimate, which is permitting people of a northern stock for the\r\nfirst time in the history of that northern stock to gain education\r\nin physical surroundings somewhat akin to those which surrounded the\r\nearly Greeks. Here you have all those advantages and you are not to\r\nbe excused if you do not show in tangible fashion your appreciation\r\nof them and your power to give practical effect to that appreciation.\r\nFrom all our citizens we have a right to expect good citizenship;\r\nbut most of all from those who have received most; most of all from\r\nthose who have had the training of body, of mind, of soul, which\r\ncomes from association in and with a great university. From those to\r\nwhom much has been given we have Biblical authority to expect and\r\ndemand much in return; and the most that can be given to any man is\r\neducation. I expect and demand in the name of the Nation much more\r\nfrom you who have had training of the mind than from those of mere\r\nwealth. To the man of means much has been given, too, and much will\r\nbe expected from him, and ought to be, but not as much as from you,\r\nbecause your possession is more valuable than his. If you envy him I\r\nthink poorly of you. Envy is merely the meanest form of admiration,\r\nand a man who envies another admits thereby his own inferiority. We\r\nhave a right to expect from the college bred man, the college bred\r\nwoman, a proper sense of proportion, a proper sense of perspective,\r\nwhich will enable him or her to see things in their right relation one\r\nto another, and when thus seen while wealth will have a proper place,\r\na just place, as an instrument for achieving happiness and power, for\r\nconferring happiness and power, it will not stand as high as much else\r\nin our national life. I ask you to take that not as a conventional\r\nstatement from the university platform, but to test it by thinking of\r\nthe men whom you admire in our past history and seeing what are the\r\nqualities which have made you admire them, what are the services they\r\nhave rendered. For as President Wheeler said to-day, it is true now\r\nas it ever has been true that the greatest good fortune, the greatest\r\nhonor, that can befall any man is that he shall serve, that he shall\r\nserve the Nation, serve his people, serve mankind; and looking back in\r\nhistory the names that come up before us, the names to which we turn,\r\nthe names of the men of our own people which stand as shining honor\r\nmarks in our annals, the names of those men typifying qualities which\r\nrightly we should hold in reverence, are the names of the statesmen,\r\nof the soldiers, of the poets—and after them, not abreast of them, the\r\nnames of the architects of our material prosperity also.\r\n\r\nOf recent years I have been thrown in contact with a number of college\r\ngraduates doing good service to the country, and as I wish to make it\r\nperfectly evident what I mean by the kind of service which I should\r\nhope to have from you and which it seems to me worth while to render,\r\nI want to say just a word about two college graduates who have during\r\nthe last five years rendered and are now rendering such services:\r\nGovernor Taft in the Philippines, and Brigadier-General Leonard\r\nWood, lately Governor of Cuba. When we acquired the Philippines and\r\ntook possession for the time being of Cuba to train its people in\r\ncitizenship, we assumed heavy responsibilities; so heavy that some\r\nvery excellent persons thought we ought to shirk them. I hold that\r\na great and masterful people forfeits its title to greatness if it\r\nshirks any work because that work is difficult and responsible.\r\nThe difficulty and responsibility impose upon us the high duty of\r\ndoing the work well, but they in no way excuse us for refusing to\r\ndo it. We had to do the work and the question came of the choice of\r\ninstruments in doing it. The most important and most difficult task\r\nafter the establishment of order by the army in the Philippines was\r\nthe establishment of civil government therein; and second only in\r\nimportance to that came the administration of Cuba, during the three\r\nyears and over that elapsed before we were able to turn its government\r\nover to its own people and start it as a free Republic. When tasks\r\nare all-important the most important factor in doing them right is\r\nthe choice of the agents; and among the many debts of gratitude which\r\nthis Nation owes to President McKinley, no debt is greater than the\r\ndebt we owe him for the choice of his instruments, such a choice as\r\nthat of Taft, such a choice as that of Wood. We sent Taft to the\r\nPhilippines; we sent Wood to Cuba; both of them as tested by the\r\nstandard of our commercial life, poor men; each man with little more\r\nthan his salary to keep himself and his family; each man to handle\r\nmillions upon millions of dollars, to have the power by mere conniving\r\nat what was improper to acquire untold wealth—and sent them knowing\r\nthat we did not ever have to consider whether such opportunities would\r\nbe temptations toward them; sent them knowing that they had the ideals\r\nof the true American and that, therefore, we did not have to consider\r\nthe chance of such a temptation appealing to them.\r\n\r\nTaft went to the Philippines to stay there; not only forfeiting\r\nthereby the certainty of brilliant rise in his profession on the\r\nbench or at the bar here if he had stayed, but at imminent risk to\r\nhis own health; because he felt that his duty as an American made him\r\ngo; that, as President McKinley told me of him, he had been drafted\r\ninto the service of the country and he could not honorably refuse.\r\nWe have seen in consequence the Philippine Islands administered by\r\nthe American official who is at the head of the government and by his\r\ncolleagues in the interest primarily of their people, and seeking to\r\nobtain for the United States, for the dominant race, that spent its\r\nblood and its treasure in making firm and stable the government of\r\nthose islands, the reward that comes from the consciousness of duty\r\nwell done. Under Taft, by and through his efforts, not only have peace\r\nand material well-being come to those islands to a degree never before\r\nknown in their recorded history, and to a degree infinitely greater\r\nthan had ever been dreamed possible by those who knew them best, but\r\nmore than that, a greater measure of self-government has been given to\r\nthem than is now given to any other Asiatic people under alien rule,\r\nthan to any other Asiatic people under their own rulers, save Japan\r\nalone. That is an achievement of the past five years which I hold to\r\nbe absolutely unparalleled in history; and when the debit and credit\r\nside of our national life is finally made up a long stroke shall be\r\nput to the credit side for what has been done in the Philippines under\r\nTaft and his associates.\r\n\r\nIn the same way Leonard Wood worked in Cuba. Put down there to do an\r\nabsolutely new task, to take a people of a different race, a different\r\nspeech, a different creed, a people just emerging from the hideous\r\nwelter of a war, cruel and sanguinary beyond what we in this fortunate\r\ncountry can readily conceive, to take a people down in the depths of\r\npoverty and misery, just recovering from suffering which makes one\r\nshudder to think of, a people untrained utterly and absolutely in\r\nself-government, and fit them for it; and he did it. For three years\r\nhe worked. He established a school system as good as the best that\r\nwe have in any of our States. He cleaned cities which had never been\r\ncleaned in their existence before. He secured absolute safety for life\r\nand property. He did the kind of governmental work which should be the\r\nundying honor of our people forever. And he came home to what? He came\r\nhome to be thanked by a few, to be attacked by others—not to their\r\ncredit—and to have as his real reward the sense that though his work\r\nhad been done at pecuniary sacrifice to him, that though the demands\r\nupon him had been such as to eat into his private means, yet he had\r\nworthily and well done his duty as an American citizen and reflected\r\nfresh honor upon the uniform of the United States Army.\r\n\r\nI have chosen Taft and Wood simply as instances of what other men\r\nby the hundred have done, Americans who have graduated from no\r\ncollege, Americans who have graduated from our different colleges, and\r\nespecially by practically all those Americans who have graduated from\r\nthe two great typical American institutions of learning—West Point and\r\nAnnapolis. Taft and Wood and their fellows are spending or have spent\r\nthe best years of their prime in doing a work which means to them\r\npecuniary loss, at the best a bare livelihood while they are doing\r\nit, and are doing it gladly because they realize the truth that the\r\nhighest privilege that can be given to any American is the privilege\r\nof serving his country, his fellow-Americans. As I am speaking to an\r\naudience with proper ideals, when I say that Taft and Wood have done\r\nall this service to their pecuniary loss I am holding them up not for\r\npity but for admiration. Every man, every woman here should feel it\r\nincumbent upon him or her to welcome with joy the chance to render\r\nservice to the country, service to our people at large, and to accept\r\nthe rendering of the service as in itself ample repayment therefor. Do\r\nnot misunderstand me. The average man, the average woman must earn his\r\nor her living in one way or another, and I most emphatically do not\r\nadvise any one to decline to do the humdrum, every-day duties because\r\nthere may come a chance for the display of heroism. I ask of you the\r\nstraightforward, earnest, performance of duty in all the little things\r\nthat come up day by day in business, in domestic life, in every way,\r\nand then when the opportunity comes, if you have thus done your duty\r\nin the lesser things, I know you will rise level to the heroic needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT BANQUET OF THE UNION LEAGUE CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., MAY 14,\r\n1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Toastmaster, and you, my Fellow-Members of the Union League\r\nClub_:\r\n\r\nNo one can too strongly insist upon the elementary fact that you can\r\nnot build the superstructure of public virtue save on private virtue.\r\nThe sum of the parts is the whole, and if we wish to make that whole,\r\nthe State, the representative and exponent and symbol of decency,\r\nit must be so made through the decency, public and private, of the\r\naverage citizen.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely essential if we are to have the proper standard of\r\npublic life that promise shall be square with performance. A lie is\r\nno more to be excused in politics than out of politics. A promise is\r\nas binding on the stump as off the stump; and there are two facets to\r\nthat crystal. In the first place, the man who makes a promise which\r\nhe does not intend to keep and does not try to keep should rightly be\r\nadjudged to have forfeited in some degree what should be every man’s\r\nmost precious possession—his honor. On the other hand, the public that\r\nexacts a promise which ought not to be kept, or which can not be kept,\r\nis by just so much forfeiting its right to self-government. There is\r\nno surer way of destroying the capacity for self-government in a\r\npeople than to accustom that people to demanding the impossible or\r\nthe improper from its public men. No man fit to be a public man will\r\npromise either the impossible or the improper; and if the demand is\r\nmade that he shall do so it means putting a premium upon the unfit in\r\npublic life. There is the same sound reason for distrusting the man\r\nwho promises too much in public that there is for distrusting the man\r\nwho promises too much in private business.\r\n\r\nThe one indispensable thing for us to keep is a high standard of\r\ncharacter for the average American citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT CARSON CITY, NEVADA, MAY 19, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Governor, Mr. Mayor, and you, my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nIt has been a great pleasure to be introduced in the more than kind\r\nwords the Governor has used, because the Governor has been a genuine\r\npioneer.\r\n\r\nHere in this great Western country, the country which is what it is\r\npurely because the pioneers who came here had iron in their veins,\r\nbecause they were able to conquer plain and mountain, and to make the\r\nwilderness blossom, we are not to be excused if we do not see to it\r\nthat the generation that comes after us is trained to have the sum of\r\nthe fundamental qualities which enabled their fathers to succeed.\r\n\r\nI want to say one special word to-day here in Carson City on a subject\r\nin which all of our people from the Atlantic to the Pacific take an\r\ninterest, but which affects in especial the people of the States of\r\nthe great plains and mountains and affects no State more than it does\r\nNevada—the question of irrigation. Now, as I say, I do not regard that\r\nas in any way merely a question of the Rocky Mountain States, of the\r\ngreat plains States, because anything which tends for the well-being\r\nof any portion of the Union is therefore for the well-being of all\r\nof it, and it was for that reason that I felt warranted in appealing\r\nto the people of the seaboard States on the Atlantic, to the people\r\nof the States of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley, to say\r\nthat it was their duty to help in bringing about a scheme of national\r\nirrigation, because the interest of any part of this country is the\r\ninterest of all of it; and no man is a really good American who fails\r\nto grasp that fact.\r\n\r\nThe National Government is still, as you all well know, but as many\r\nEasterners do not know, the greatest land owner in the Western States,\r\nand among all those States Nevada holds the great proportion of vacant\r\npublic land, and the need of Nevada for Federal assistance was one\r\nof the strongest arguments used in the discussion which preceded the\r\nreclamation act of June, 1902, the irrigation act of a year ago. The\r\ngreat extent of the vacant public lands in the State, the fact that\r\nits water supply came chiefly from streams rising in the adjoining\r\nState of California, and the overwhelming difficulties which for these\r\nand other reasons prevented the people of Nevada from efficiently\r\nacting in their own interest, made, in my judgment, and, as it proved,\r\nin the judgment of the Congress, Federal interference absolutely\r\nimperative. It is a matter for the strongest congratulation, not\r\nonly for the West, but for the whole Nation, that the policy went\r\ninto effect. It is a matter of special congratulation to Nevada that\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, guided in his choice wholly by actual\r\nconditions on the ground, has been led to undertake one of the five\r\nsets of works which have been first undertaken, here in Nevada,\r\nparticularly near Reno on the Truckee River, as one of the national\r\nprojects for the starting and working of the methods of the law.\r\nExtensive surveys have already been made, and the projects for water\r\nstorage and water distribution are at a point which warrants our\r\nbelief that immediate action is in sight. There are vast tracts of\r\nexcellent land still in the ownership of the general government here\r\nin Nevada and elsewhere to which the reclamation act will bring the\r\nflood waters that now annually go to waste. For Nevada most of these\r\nwaters originate in the high mountains lying in sight of Reno, largely\r\njust across the State line in California. Some of these mountains\r\nhave been included in the forest reserves, and your interests and the\r\ninterests of the irrigators in California imperatively demand the\r\nextension of the forest reserve system so that the source of supply\r\nfor the great reservoirs and irrigation works may be safe from fire,\r\nfrom over-grazing, and from destructive lumbering. I ask you to pay\r\nattention to what I say when I use the word destructive lumbering;\r\nno one can desire to prevent, or do anything but help, practical and\r\nconservative lumbering. In other words, my fellow-citizens, we have\r\nreached a condition in which it must be the object of the Nation and\r\nthe State to favor the development of the home-maker, of the man\r\nwho takes up the land intending to keep it for himself and for his\r\nchildren, so that it shall be even of better use to them than to him.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities for the development of Nevada are very great. Until\r\nrecently Nevada was only thought of as a mineral and stock-raising\r\nState. Much can be done yet as regards both the mineral exploitation\r\nand the raising of stock within the State; but now under the stimulus\r\nof irrigation it is probable that irrigated agriculture will come\r\nto the front, and when it does the population will increase with a\r\nrapidity and permanence never before known. The State of Nevada has\r\nled the way not only in the strength of its plea for national aid\r\nin irrigation, but also in its willingness to assist in the work.\r\nI wish to lay emphasis on the fact that in Nevada the authorities\r\nhave been anxious in every way to help in working out the problem of\r\nirrigation; and to pay all acknowledgment to them now. The recent\r\nLegislature passed laws which in many respects should serve as models\r\nfor the legislation of other States. The union of land and water under\r\nthe national law has been recognized, and so has the fundamental\r\nproposition which necessarily underlies the prosperity of all\r\ncommunities in which irrigated agriculture is the chief industry,\r\nnamely, that the water belongs to the people and can not be made a\r\nmonopoly. The public appreciation of this fundamental truth that the\r\nwater belongs to the people to be taken and put to beneficial use will\r\nwipe out many controversies which are at present so harmful to the\r\ndevelopment of the West. And the example of Nevada will be of material\r\naid in bringing about this fortunate result.\r\n\r\nAs I said of the forests so it is even more true of the water supply.\r\nIt should be our constant policy by national and by State legislation\r\nto see that the water is used for the benefit of the occupants of the\r\nsoil, of those who till and use the soil, that it is not exploited by\r\nany one man or set of men in his or their interests as against the\r\ninterests of those on the land who are to use it. It is a fundamental\r\ntruth that the prosperity of any people is simply another term for the\r\nprosperity of the home-makers among that people. Our entire policy in\r\nirrigation, in forestry, in handling the public lands, should be in\r\nrecognition of that truth, to favor in every way the man who wishes to\r\ntake up a given area of soil and thereon to build a home in which he\r\nwill rear his children as useful citizens of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ADDRESS AT THE LAYING OF THE CORNERSTONE OF THE LEWIS AND CLARK\r\nMEMORIAL, PORTLAND, ORE., MAY 21, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mayor, and you, my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nWe come here to-day to lay a cornerstone of a monument that is to\r\ncall to mind the greatest single pioneering feat on this continent,\r\nthe voyage across the continent by Lewis and Clark, which rounded\r\nout the ripe statesmanship of Jefferson and his fellows by giving\r\nto the United States all of the domain between the Mississippi and\r\nthe Pacific. Following their advent came the reign of the fur trade;\r\nand then some sixty years ago those entered in whose children and\r\nchildren’s children were to possess the land. Across the continent\r\nin the early 40’s came the ox-drawn white-topped wagons bearing the\r\npioneers, the stalwart, sturdy, sunburned men, with their wives and\r\ntheir little ones, who entered into this country to possess it. You\r\nhave built up here this wonderful commonwealth, a commonwealth great\r\nin its past, and infinitely greater in its future.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure to me to-day to have as part of my escort the men of\r\nthe Second Oregon, who carried on the expansion of our people beyond\r\nthe Pacific as your fathers had carried it on to the Pacific. Speaking\r\nto you here I do not have to ask you to face the future high of heart\r\nand confident of soul. You could not assume any other attitude and be\r\ntrue to your blood, true to the position in which you find yourselves\r\non this continent. I speak to the men of the Pacific Slope, to the\r\nmen whose predecessors gave us this region because they were not\r\nafraid, because they did not seek the life of ease and safety, because\r\ntheir life training was not to shrink from obstacles but to meet and\r\novercome them; and now I ask that this Nation go forward as it has\r\ngone forward in the past; I ask that it shape its life in accordance\r\nwith the highest ideals; I ask that our name be a synonym for truthful\r\nand fair dealing with all the nations of the world; and I ask two\r\nthings in connection with our foreign policy—that we never wrong the\r\nweak and that we never flinch from the strong. Base is the man who\r\ninflicts a wrong, and base is the man who suffers a wrong to be done\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWe have met to commemorate a mighty pioneer feat, a feat of the\r\nold days, when men needed to call upon every ounce of courage and\r\nhardihood and manliness they possessed in order to make good our\r\nclaim to this continent. Let us in our turn with equal courage, equal\r\nhardihood and manliness, carry on the task that our forefathers have\r\nintrusted to our hands; and let us resolve that we shall leave to our\r\nchildren and our children’s children an even mightier heritage than we\r\nreceived in our turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN ACCEPTING SOUVENIR PRESENTED BY THE WORKMEN OF THE NAVY\r\nYARD, BREMERTON, WASH., MAY 23, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to thank you and through you your fellow workmen for this\r\ntoken. I also wish to repeat what I have said before, that the\r\nvictories of Manila and Santiago reflect credit not merely upon those\r\nwho fought, but upon every man who did his work in preparing the\r\nships for battle. There is not a workman in any of our yards who did\r\nhis duty in connection with the guns, the armor plate, the turrets,\r\nthe hulls, or anything, who has not his full right to a share in the\r\ncredit of those victories. You all did your part in winning them just\r\nas much as the men who actually fought. Nothing could have pleased me\r\nmore than to have received this gift from the men of the yard, and I\r\nappreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ARCTIC BROTHERHOOD, SEATTLE, WASH., MAY 23, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chairman, and you, Men and Women of Alaska_:\r\n\r\nLet me thank you and the members of the Arctic Brotherhood for their\r\ngreeting. I am happy to say that during the last year or two the\r\nNational Legislature has begun to realize its responsibilities in\r\nreference to Alaska; and that even those of our people who do not\r\nlive on the Pacific Slope are beginning to understand that in the\r\nnot distant future Alaska will be not merely a regularly organized\r\nTerritory, but a great and populous State.\r\n\r\nVery few European races have exercised a more profound influence\r\nupon Europe, and none has had a more heroic history, than the race\r\noccupying the Scandinavian peninsula of the Old World. And Alaska lies\r\nin the same latitude as, and can and will in the lifetime of those\r\nI am addressing support as great a population as, the Scandinavian\r\npeninsula. It is curious how our fate as a Nation has often driven us\r\nforward toward greatness in spite of the protests of many of those\r\nesteeming themselves in point of training and culture best fitted to\r\nshape the Nation’s destiny. In 1803, when we acquired the territory\r\nstretching from the Mississippi to the Pacific, there were plenty\r\nof wise men who announced that we were acquiring a mere desert,\r\nthat it was a violation of the Constitution to acquire it, and that\r\nthe acquisition was fraught with the seeds of the dissolution of\r\nthe Republic. And think how absolutely the event has falsified the\r\npredictions of those men. So when in the late 60’s we by treaty\r\nacquired Alaska, this great territory with its infinite possibilities\r\nwas taken by this Republic in spite of the bitter opposition of many\r\nmen who were patriots according to their lights and who esteemed\r\nthemselves far-sighted. And but five years ago there were excellent\r\nmen who bemoaned the fact that we were obliged during the war with\r\nSpain to take possession of the Philippines and to show that we\r\nwere hereafter to be one of the dominant powers of the Pacific. In\r\nevery instance how the after events of history have falsified the\r\npredictions of the men of little faith! There are critics so feeble\r\nand so timid that they shrink back when this Nation asserts that it\r\ncomes in the category of the nations who dare to be great, and they\r\nwant to know, forsooth, the cost of greatness and what it means. We do\r\nnot know the cost, but we know it will be more than repaid ten times\r\nover by the result; and what it may ultimately mean we do not know,\r\nbut we know what the present holds, what the present need demands, and\r\nwe take the present and hold ourselves ready to abide the result of\r\nwhatever the future may bring.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak to you of the Pacific Slope, to you of the new Northwest,\r\nwhose cities are seated here by the Sound, I speak to people abounding\r\nin their youth and their virile manhood, who do not fear to grasp\r\nopportunity as the opportunity comes, and who weigh slight risk but\r\nlightly in the balance when on the other side of the scale comes the\r\ngreatness of triumph, the greatness of acquisition. We took Alaska\r\nthirty-five years ago, and at last we have begun to wake up to the\r\nheritage that thereby we have handed over to our children. I speak to\r\nyou, citizens of Alaska, people who have dwelt therein, to say how\r\nmuch all our people owe to you. During the last year many wise laws\r\nhave been put upon the statute book in reference to Alaska; not as\r\nmany as should have been put, but a good many. I earnestly hope that\r\nCongress will speedily provide for a delegate from Alaska, so that\r\nthe people of the Territory may have some recognized exponent whose\r\nduty it shall be to place its needs before the National Legislature.\r\nMeanwhile, with the assistance of the Senators and Representatives in\r\nCongress from this section of the country, I shall do all that in me\r\nlies to see that the proper kinds of legislation are enacted for the\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the great development of Alaska of course is\r\nto be found in its mines; but most of the people of this country are\r\nwholly in error when they think of the mines as being the sole or\r\neven the chief permanent cause of Alaska’s future greatness. Alaska\r\nhas great possibilities of agricultural and pastoral development.\r\nNot only her mines, her fisheries, her forests, but her agriculture\r\nand her stock-raising will combine to make Alaska one of the great\r\nwealth-producing portions of our Republic. I am anxious that our laws\r\nshould be framed in the interest of those who intend to go there and\r\nstay there and bring up their children there and make it in very fact\r\nas well as in name an integral part of this Republic. I ask your help\r\nand pledge you my help in the effort to secure such legislation. In\r\nthe case of the mine you get the metal out of the earth, you can not\r\nleave any metal in there to produce other metal; but in the case of\r\nthe salmon fishery, if you are wise you will insist upon its being\r\ncarried on under conditions which will make the salmon fishery as\r\nvaluable in that river thirty years hence as now. Do not take all the\r\nsalmon out and go away and leave the empty river for your children and\r\nchildren’s children; take it out under conditions—the conditions are\r\nready to be created for you by the National Fish Commission, which\r\nhas been so singularly successful in its work—which will secure the\r\npreservation of that river as a salmon river, which will secure the\r\nperpetuation of salmon canneries along its banks, so that it will be\r\nnot an industry carried on only by Orientals in the employ of three\r\nor four alien capitalists, but carried on in such a way as to be a\r\nperpetual source of income to the actual settlers resident in the\r\nlocality. Just in the same way I want to have you see that the lumber\r\nindustry is exploited in a way which, while giving a great return to\r\nthose engaged in it at the moment, shall also secure the preservation\r\nof the forests for the settlers and the settlers’ children that are\r\nto come in and inherit the land. I wish to see such land laws enacted\r\nand to see them so administered as to be in the interest of the actual\r\nsettler who goes to Alaska to live, who desires there to produce\r\ncrops, to raise stock, to make a home for himself; subject to that\r\ncondition I desire to see legislation shaped in the spirit of the\r\nbroadest liberality that will secure the quickest possible development\r\nof the resources of Alaska; and with that aim in view to have all\r\nthe encouragement possible given to those seeking to establish by\r\nsteamship line and by railway quick and efficient transportation\r\nfacilities in the Territory.\r\n\r\nFew things have been more typical of our people and have been more\r\nfull of promise for the future than the way in which the resources\r\nhave been developed; and when one sees what has been done here\r\nduring the last few years I think we have cause to feel abundantly\r\njustified in our belief that the qualities of the old-time pioneers\r\nwho first penetrated the woody wilderness between the Alleghanies\r\nand the Mississippi, who then steered their way across vast seas of\r\ngrass from the Mississippi to the Rockies, who penetrated the passes\r\nof the great barren mountains until they came to this, the greatest\r\nof all the oceans, still survive in their grandsons and successors.\r\nNor must we forget in speaking of Alaska the immense importance that\r\nthe Territory has from the standpoint of the needs of the Nation as\r\na whole, as a dominant power in the Pacific. Exactly as with the\r\nbuilding of the Isthmian Canal we shall make our Atlantic and our\r\nPacific coasts in effect continuous, so the possession and peopling of\r\nthe Alaskan seacoast puts us in a position of dominance as regards the\r\nPacific which no other nations share or can share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ADDRESS AT EVERETT, WASH., MAY 23, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few problems which so especially concern Washington, Oregon,\r\nand California as the problem of forestry. Nothing has been of better\r\naugury for the welfare and prosperity of these great States as well\r\nas for the other forest States than the way in which those actively\r\nengaged in the lumbering business have come of recent years to work\r\nhand in hand with those who have made forestry a study in the effort\r\nto preserve the forests. The whole question is a business, an economic\r\nquestion; an economic question for the Nation, a business question\r\nfor the individual. East of your great mountain chains the question\r\nof water supply becomes vital and becomes inseparable from that\r\nof forestry. Here that question does not enter in. The lumbering\r\ninterest is the fourth great business interest in point of importance\r\nin the United States. There is engaged in it a capital of over six\r\nhundred millions of dollars, and every year the wage-workers in that\r\nindustry receive one hundred millions of dollars. Such an industry\r\nso vitally connected with many others in the country can not with\r\nwisdom be neglected, the interests depending upon it are too vast. I\r\ndo not have to say here in Washington that fire is a great enemy of\r\nthe forests. Here in Washington it is probable that fire has destroyed\r\nmore than the axe during the decade in which the axe has been at work.\r\n\r\nOur aim should be to get the fullest use from the forest to-day,\r\nand yet to get that benefit in ways which will keep the forests for\r\nour children in the generations to come; so that, for instance, the\r\ncountry adjoining Puget Sound shall have the lumbering industry as\r\na permanent industry. Recently the trade journals of that industry\r\nhave been dwelling upon the fact that its very existence is actually\r\nat stake, and nowhere in the whole country can the question of\r\nforestry be handled better than in this region, because nowhere else\r\nis it so easy to produce a second crop. You are fortunate in having\r\nsuch climatic conditions, such conditions of soil, that here more\r\nthan anywhere else the forest renews itself quickly, so as in a\r\ncomparatively short number of years to be again a great mercantile and\r\nindustrial asset. The preservation of our forests depends chiefly\r\nupon the wisdom with which the practical lumberman, the practical\r\nexpert in dealing with the lumber industry, works with the men who\r\nhave studied forestry under all conditions. I am glad indeed that such\r\nco-operation is more and more being accepted as a matter of course by\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ADDRESS AT SEATTLE, WASH., MAY 23, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no other body of water in the world which confers upon the\r\ncommonwealth possessing it quite the natural advantages that Puget\r\nSound confers upon your State. There is no other State in the Union,\r\nand I include all of them, which has greater natural advantages and\r\na more assured future of greatness than this State of Washington.\r\nPhenomenal though your growth has been, it has barely begun; and your\r\ngrowth in the half century now opening will dwarf absolutely even your\r\ngrowth in the immediate past.\r\n\r\nI am speaking in the gateway to Alaska. All our people, even those\r\nfrom the locality whence I come, are beginning to appreciate a little\r\nof Alaska’s future. The men of my own age whom I am addressing will\r\nnot be old men before we see Alaska one of the rich and strong States\r\nof the Union. I thank fortune that the National Legislature has begun\r\nto wake up to the fact that Alaska has interests of vital importance\r\nnot merely to her but to the entire Union. Alaska contains a territory\r\nwhich will within this century support as large a population as the\r\ncombined Scandinavian countries of Europe; those countries from which\r\nhas sprung as wonderful a race as ever imprinted its characteristics\r\nupon the history of civilization. Exactly as the Scandinavian peoples\r\nhave left their mark upon the entire history of Europe, so we shall\r\nsee Alaska with its mines, its lumber, its fisheries, with its\r\npossibilities in agriculture and stock-raising, with its possibilities\r\nof commercial command, with the tremendous development that is going\r\non within it even now, produce as hardy and vigorous a people as any\r\nportion of North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT SPOKANE, WASH., MAY 26, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Senator Turner, and you, my Fellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nI am in a city at the eastern gateway of this State with the great\r\nrailroad systems of the State running through it. On the western\r\nedge of this State in Puget Sound I have seen the homing places of\r\nthe great steamship lines, which, in connection with these great\r\nrailroads, are doing so much to develop the Oriental trade of this\r\ncountry and this State. Washington will owe no small part of its\r\nfuture greatness, and that greatness will be great indeed, to the\r\nfact that it is thus doing its share in acquiring for the United\r\nStates the dominance of the Pacific. Those railroads, the men and\r\nthe corporations that have built them, have rendered a very great\r\nservice to the community. The men who are building, the corporations\r\nwhich are building the great steamship lines have likewise rendered\r\na very great service to the community. Every man who has made wealth\r\nor used it in developing great legitimate business enterprises has\r\nbeen of benefit and not harm to the country at large. This city has\r\ngrown by leaps and bounds only when the railroads came to it, when\r\nthe railroads came to the State; and if the State were now cut off\r\nfrom its connection by rail and by steamship with the rest of the\r\nworld its position would of course diminish incalculably. Great good\r\nhas come from the development of our railroad system; great good has\r\nbeen done by the individuals and corporations that have made that\r\ndevelopment possible; and in return good is done to them, and not\r\nharm, when they are required to obey the law. Ours is a government of\r\nliberty by, through and under the law. No man is above it and no man\r\nis below it. The crime of cunning, the crime of greed, the crime of\r\nviolence, are all equally crimes, and against them all alike the law\r\nmust set its face. This is not and never shall be a government either\r\nof a plutocracy or of a mob. It is, it has been, and it will be, a\r\ngovernment of the people; including alike the people of great wealth\r\nand of moderate wealth, the people who employ others, the people who\r\nare employed, the wage-worker, the lawyer, the mechanic, the banker,\r\nthe farmer; including them all, protecting each and every one if he\r\nacts decently and squarely, and discriminating against any one of\r\nthem, no matter from what class he comes, if he does not act squarely\r\nand fairly, if he does not obey the law. While all people are foolish\r\nif they violate or rail against the law—wicked as well as foolish, but\r\nall foolish—yet the most foolish man in this Republic is the man of\r\nwealth who complains because the law is administered with impartial\r\njustice against or for him. His folly is greater than the folly of any\r\nother man who so complains; for he lives and moves and has his being\r\nbecause the law does in fact protect him and his property.\r\n\r\nWe have the right to ask every decent American citizen to rally to the\r\nsupport of the law if it is ever broken against the interest of the\r\nrich man; and we have the same right to ask that rich man cheerfully\r\nand gladly to acquiesce in the enforcement against his seeming\r\ninterest of the law, if it is the law. Incidentally, whether he\r\nacquiesces or not, the law will be enforced, and this whoever he may\r\nbe, great or small, and at whichever end of the social scale he may be.\r\n\r\nI ask that we see to it in our country that the line of division in\r\nthe deeper matters of our citizenship be drawn, never between section\r\nand section, never between creed and creed, never, thrice never,\r\nbetween class and class; but that the line be drawn on the line of\r\nconduct, cutting through sections, cutting through creeds, cutting\r\nthrough classes; the line that divides the honest from the dishonest,\r\nthe line that divides good citizenship from bad citizenship, the line\r\nthat declares a man a good citizen only if, and always if, he acts in\r\naccordance with the immutable law of righteousness, which has been\r\nthe same from the beginning of history to the present moment, and\r\nwhich will be the same from now until the end of recorded time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ADDRESS AT COLUMBIA GARDENS, BUTTE, MONT., MAY 27, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chairman, and you, my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nIt would have been a great pleasure to come to Butte in any event;\r\nit is a double pleasure to come here at the invitation of the\r\nrepresentatives of the wage-workers of Butte. I do not say merely\r\nworkingmen, because I hold that every good American who does his duty\r\nmust be a workingman. There are many different kinds of work to do;\r\nbut so long as the work is honorable, is necessary, and is well done\r\nthe man who does it well is entitled to the respect of his fellows.\r\n\r\nI have come here to this meeting especially as the invited guest of\r\nthe wage-workers, and I am happy to be able to say that the kind of\r\nspeech I will make to you, I would make just in exactly the same\r\nlanguage to any group of employers or any set of our citizens in any\r\ncorner of this Republic. I do not think so far as I know that I have\r\never promised beforehand anything I did not make a strong effort to\r\nmake good afterward. It is sometimes very attractive and very pleasant\r\nto make any kind of a promise without thinking whether or not you can\r\nfulfil it; but in the after event it is always unpleasant when the\r\ntime for fulfilling comes; for in the long run the most disagreeable\r\ntruth is a safer companion than the most pleasant falsehood.\r\n\r\nTo-night I have come hither looking on either hand at the results of\r\nthe enterprises which have made Butte so great. The man who by the use\r\nof his capital develops a great mine, the man who by the use of his\r\ncapital builds a great railroad, the man who by the use of his capital\r\neither individually or joined with others like him does any great\r\nlegitimate business enterprise, confers a benefit, not a harm, upon\r\nthe community, and is entitled to be so regarded. He is entitled to\r\nthe protection of the law, and in return he is to be required himself\r\nto obey the law. The law is no respecter of persons. The law is to be\r\nadministered neither for the rich man as such, nor for the poor man as\r\nsuch. It is to be administered for every man, rich or poor, if he is\r\nan honest and law-abiding citizen; and it is to be invoked against any\r\nman, rich or poor, who violates it, without regard to which end of the\r\nsocial scale he may stand at, without regard to whether his offence\r\ntakes the form of greed and cunning, or the form of physical violence;\r\nin either case if he violates the law, the law is to be invoked\r\nagainst him; and in so invoking it I have the right to challenge the\r\nsupport of all good citizens and to demand the acquiescence of every\r\ngood man. I hope I will have it; but once for all I wish it understood\r\nthat even if I do not have it I shall enforce the law.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers who fought in the great Civil War fought for liberty\r\nunder, by, and through the law; and they fought to put a stop\r\nonce for all to any effort to sunder this country on the lines of\r\nsectional hatred; therefore their memory shall be forever precious\r\nto our people. We need to keep ever in mind that he is the worst\r\nenemy of this country who would strive to separate its people along\r\nthe lines of section against section, of creed against creed, or of\r\nclass against class. There are two sides to that. It is a base and an\r\ninfamous thing for the man of means to act in a spirit of arrogant and\r\nbrutal disregard of right toward his fellow who has less means; and\r\nit is no less infamous, no less base, to act in a spirit of rancor,\r\nenvy, and hatred against the man of greater means, merely because\r\nof his greater means. If we are to preserve this Republic as it was\r\nfounded, as it was handed down to us by the men of ’61 to ’65, and as\r\nit is and will be, we must draw the line never between section and\r\nsection, never between creed and creed, thrice never between class and\r\nclass; but along the line of conduct, the line that separates the good\r\ncitizen wherever he may be found from the bad citizen wherever he may\r\nbe found. This is not and never shall be a government of a plutocracy;\r\nit is not and never shall be a government by a mob. It is as it has\r\nbeen and as it will be, a government in which every honest man, every\r\ndecent man, be he employer or employed, wage-worker, mechanic, banker,\r\nlawyer, farmer, be he who he may, if he acts squarely and fairly, if\r\nhe does his duty by his neighbor and the State, receives the full\r\nprotection of the law and is given the amplest chance to exercise the\r\nability that there is within him, alone or in combination with his\r\nfellows as he desires. My friends, it is sometimes easier to preach\r\na doctrine under which the millennium will be promised off-hand if\r\nyou have a particular kind of law, or follow a particular kind of\r\nconduct—it is easier, but it is not better. The millennium is not\r\nhere; it is some thousand years off yet. Meanwhile there must be a\r\ngood deal of work and struggle, a good deal of injustice; we shall\r\noften see the tower of Siloam fall on the just as well as the unjust.\r\nWe are bound in honor to try to remedy injustice, but if we are wise\r\nwe will seek to remedy it in practical ways. Above all, remember this:\r\nthat the most unsafe adviser to follow is the man who would advise us\r\nto do wrong in order that we may benefit by it. That man is never a\r\nsafe man to follow; he is always the most dangerous of guides. The man\r\nwho seeks to persuade any of us that our advantage comes in wronging\r\nor oppressing others can be depended upon, if the opportunity comes,\r\nto do wrong to us in his own interest, just as he has endeavored to\r\nmake us in our supposed interest do wrong to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE TABERNACLE, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, MAY 29, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Governor, Mr. Mayor, Senator Kearns, and you, my\r\nFellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nI am particularly glad to have the chance to speak to you here in\r\nthis city, in Utah, this morning, because you have exemplified a\r\ndoctrine which it seems to me all-essential for our people ever to\r\nkeep fresh in their minds—the fact that though natural resources can\r\ndo a good deal, though the law can do a good deal, the fundamental\r\nrequisite in building up prosperity and civilization is the requisite\r\nof individual character in the individual man or woman. Here in this\r\nState the pioneers and those who came after them took not the land\r\nthat would ordinarily be chosen as land that would yield return with\r\nlittle effort. You took territory which at the outset was called after\r\nthe desert, and you literally—not figuratively—you literally made the\r\nwilderness blossom as the rose. The fundamental element in building up\r\nUtah has been the work of the citizens of Utah. And you did it because\r\nyour people entered in to possess the land and to leave it after them\r\nto their children and their children’s children. You here whom I am\r\naddressing and your predecessors did not come in to exploit the land\r\nand then go somewhere else. You came in, as the Governor has said, as\r\nhome-makers, to make homes for yourselves and those who should come\r\nafter you; and that is the only way in which a State can be built up,\r\nin which the Nation can be built up. You have built up this great\r\ncommunity because you came here with the purpose of making this your\r\nabiding home, and of leaving to your children not an impoverished, but\r\nan enriched heritage; and I ask that all our people from one ocean to\r\nthe other, but especially the people of the arid and the semi-arid\r\nregions, the people of the great plains, the people of the mountains,\r\napproach the problem of taking care of the physical resources of\r\nthe country in the spirit which has made Utah what it is. You have\r\ndeveloped your metal wealth wonderfully; and your growth is not a boom\r\ngrowth—it is a thoroughly healthy, normal growth. During the past\r\ndecade the population has doubled and the wealth quadrupled; and labor\r\nis employed at as high a compensation as is paid elsewhere in the\r\nworld. Although you are not essentially a mining State, in the last\r\nyear you marketed thirty millions’ worth of ore; and again you showed\r\nyour good sense in the way you handled it; for you paid five millions\r\nin dividends and you invested the balance in labor and surplus. The\r\neffort to make a big showing in dividends is not always healthy for\r\nthe future. Here you have shown your wonderful capacity to develop the\r\nearth so as to make both irrigated agriculture and stock-raising in\r\nall its forms two great industries. When you deal with a mine you take\r\nthe ore out of the earth and take it away, and in the end exhaust the\r\nmine. The time may be very long in coming before it is exhausted, or\r\nit may be a short time; but in any event, mining means the exhaustion\r\nof the mine. But that is exactly what agriculture does not and must\r\nnot mean.\r\n\r\nSo far from agriculture properly exhausting the land, it is always the\r\nsign of a vicious system of agriculture if the land is rendered poorer\r\nby it. The direct contrary should be the fact. After the farmer has\r\nhad the farm for his life he should be able to hand it to his children\r\nas a better farm than it was when he had it.\r\n\r\nIn these regions, in the Rocky Mountain regions, it is especially\r\nincumbent upon us to treat the question of the natural pasturage,\r\nthe question of the forests, and the question of the use of the\r\nwaters, all from the one standpoint—the standpoint of the far-seeing\r\nstatesman, of the far-seeing citizen, who wishes to preserve and not\r\nto exhaust the resources of the country, who wishes to see those\r\nresources come into the hands not of a few men of great wealth, least\r\nof all into the hands of a few men who will speculate in them; but be\r\ndistributed among many men, each of whom intends to make his home in\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThis whole so-called arid and semi-arid region is by nature the stock\r\nrange of the Nation. One of the questions which are rising to confront\r\nus is how this range may be made to produce the greatest number and\r\nbest quality of horses, cattle, and sheep, not only this year, not\r\nonly next year, but for this generation and the next generation. The\r\nold system of grazing the ranges so closely as to injure the whole\r\ncrop of grass was a serious detriment to the development of the West,\r\na serious detriment to the development of our people. The ranges must\r\nbe treated as a great invested capital; and that old system tended to\r\ndissipate and partially to destroy that capital. That is something\r\nthat we can not as a Nation of home-makers permit. The wise man, the\r\nwise industry, the wise nation, maintains such capital unimpaired and\r\ntries to increase it; and more and more the range lands will be used\r\nin conjunction with the small irrigable areas which they include;\r\nso that the industry can take on a more stable character than ever\r\nbefore. It is impossible permanently, although it may be advisable for\r\nthe time being, to move stock in a body from summer to winter ranges\r\nacross country which can be made into homesteads, because when the\r\ncountry can itself be taken by actual settlers, in the long run it\r\nwill only be possible to move the stock through hundreds of miles of\r\ndusty lanes where they can not graze, where they can not live. Our\r\naim must be steadily to help develop the settler, the man who lives\r\nin the land and in growing up with it and raising his children to own\r\nit after him. More and more hereafter the stock owners will have the\r\nnecessity forced upon them of providing green summer pasturage within\r\nthe limits of their own ranges; and so the question of irrigation is\r\nwellnigh as important to the stockmen as to the agriculturist proper.\r\n\r\nIn the same way our mountain forests must be preserved from the harm\r\ndone by over-grazing. Let all the grazing be done in them that can be\r\ndone without injury to them, but do not let the mountain forests be\r\ndespoiled by the man who will over-graze them and destroy them for the\r\nsake of three years’ use, and then go somewhere else, and leave by so\r\nmuch diminished the heritage of those who remain permanently in the\r\nland. I believe that already the movement has begun which will make in\r\nthe long run the stock-raisers,—of whom I have been one myself, whose\r\nbusiness I know, and with whom I feel the heartiest sympathy,—through\r\nthe enlightenment of their own self-interest, become the heartiest\r\ndefenders and the chief beneficiaries of the wise and moderate use of\r\nforest ranges, both within and without the forest reserves. It is and\r\nit must be the definite policy of this government to consider the good\r\nof all its citizens—stockmen, lumbermen, irrigators, and all others—in\r\ndealing with the forest reserves; and for that reason I most earnestly\r\ndesire in every way to bring about the heartiest co-operation between\r\nthe men who are doing the actual business of stock-raising, the\r\nactual business of irrigated agriculture, the actual business of\r\nlumbering,—the closest and most intimate relations, the heartiest\r\nco-operation between them and the government at Washington through\r\nthe Department of Agriculture. Of course I do not have to say to any\r\naudience of intelligent people that nothing is such an enemy to the\r\nstock industry as persistent over-grazing. We shall have not far hence\r\nto raise the problem of the best method of making use of the public\r\nrange. Our people have not as yet settled in their own minds what\r\nis that best method. In some way there will have to be formed such\r\nregulation as shall without undue restriction prevent the needless\r\nover-grazing, while keeping the public lands open to settlement\r\nthrough homestead entry. Such a policy would, of course, be of the\r\nmost far-reaching benefit to the whole range industry. It is the same\r\nin dealing with our forest reserves. Almost every industry depends\r\nin some more or less vital way upon the preservation of the forests;\r\nand while citizens die, the government and the nation do not die, and\r\nwe are bound in dealing with the forests to exercise the foresight\r\nnecessary to use them now, but to use them in such a way as will also\r\nkeep them for those who are to come after us.\r\n\r\nThe first great object of the forest reserves is, of course, the\r\nfirst great object of the whole land policy of the United States,—the\r\ncreation of homes, the favoring of the home-maker. That is why we\r\nwish to provide for the home-makers of the present and the future\r\nthe steady and continuous supply of timber, grass, and above all, of\r\nwater. That is the object of the forest reserves, and that is why I\r\nbespeak your cordial co-operation in their preservation. Remember you\r\nmust realize, what I thoroughly realize, that however wise a policy\r\nmay be it can be enforced only if the people of the States believe in\r\nit. We can enforce the provisions of the forest reserve law or of any\r\nother law only so far as the best sentiment of the community or the\r\nState will permit that enforcement. Therefore it lies primarily not\r\nwith the people at Washington, but with you, yourselves, to see that\r\nsuch policies are supported as will redound to the benefit of the home\r\nmakers and therefore the sure and steady building up of the State as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nOne word as to the greatest question with which our people as a whole\r\nhave to deal in the matter of internal development to-day—the question\r\nof irrigation. Not of recent years has any more important law been\r\nput upon the statute books of the Federal Government than the law a\r\nyear ago providing for the first time that the National Government\r\nshould interest itself in aiding and building up a system of irrigated\r\nagriculture in the Rocky Mountains and plains States. Here the\r\ngovernment had to a large degree to sit at the feet of Gamaliel in the\r\nperson of Utah; for what you had done and learned was of literally\r\nincalculable benefit to those engaged in framing and getting through\r\nthe national irrigation law. Irrigation was first practiced on a large\r\nscale in this State. The necessity of the pioneers here led to the\r\ndevelopment of irrigation to a degree absolutely unknown before on\r\nthis continent. In no respect is the wisdom of the early pioneers made\r\nmore evident than in the sedulous care they took to provide for small\r\nfarms, carefully tilled by those who lived on and benefited from them;\r\nand hence it comes about that the average amount of land required to\r\nsupport a family in Utah is smaller than in any other part of the\r\nUnited States. We all know that when you once get irrigation applied\r\nrain is a very poor substitute for it. The Federal Government must\r\nco-operate with Utah and Utah people for a further extension of the\r\nirrigated area. Many of the simpler problems of obtaining and applying\r\nwater have already been solved and so well solved that, as I have\r\nsaid, some of the most important provisions of the Federal act, such\r\nas the control of the irrigating works by the communities they serve,\r\nsuch as making the water appurtenant to the land and not a source of\r\nspeculation apart from the land, were based upon the experience of\r\nUtah. Of course the control of the larger streams which flow through\r\nmore than one State must come under the Federal Government. Many of\r\nthe great tracts which will ultimately so enlarge the cultivated\r\narea of Utah, which will ultimately so increase its population and\r\nwealth, are surrounded with intricate complications because of the\r\nhigh development which irrigation has already reached in this State.\r\nNecessarily the Federal officers charged with the execution of the law\r\nmust proceed with great caution so as not to disturb present vested\r\nrights; but subject to that, they will go forward as fast as they\r\ncan. They realize, and all men who have actually done irrigating here\r\nwill realize, that no man is more timid than the practical irrigator\r\nregarding any change in the water distribution. He wants to look\r\nwell before he leaps. He has learned from bitter experience what\r\ndamage can come from well meant changes hastily made. The government\r\ncan do a good deal; the government will do a good deal; but your\r\nexperience here in Utah has shown that the greatest results which\r\nare accomplishing most spring directly from the sturdy courage, the\r\nself-denial, the willingness with iron resolution to endure the risk\r\nand the suffering, of the pioneers; for they were the men who sought\r\nand found a livelihood in what was once a desert, and they must be\r\nprotected in the legitimate fruits of their toil.\r\n\r\nOne of the tasks that the government must do here in Utah is to build\r\nreservoirs for the storage of the flood waters, to undertake works\r\ntoo great to be undertaken by private capital. Great as the task is,\r\nand great as its benefits will become, the government must do still\r\nmore. Besides the storage of the water there must be protection of the\r\nwatersheds; and that is why I ask you to help the National Government\r\nprotect the watersheds by protecting the forests upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT FREEPORT, ILL., JUNE 3, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Congressman Hitt, and you, my Fellow-Countrymen_:\r\n\r\nHere where we meet to-day there occurred one of those memorable\r\nscenes in accordance with which the whole future history of nations\r\nis molded. Here were spoken winged words that flew through immediate\r\ntime and that will fly through that portion of eternity recorded in\r\nthe history of our race. Here was sounded the keynote of the struggle\r\nwhich after convulsing the Nation, made it in fact what it had only\r\nbeen in name,—at once united and free. It is eminently fitting that\r\nthis monument, given by the women of this city in commemoration of the\r\ngreat debate that here took place, should be dedicated by the men\r\nwhose deeds made good the words of Abraham Lincoln—the soldiers of\r\nthe Civil War. The word was mighty. Had it not been for the word the\r\ndeeds could not have taken place; but without the deeds the word would\r\nhave been the idlest breath. It is forever to the honor of our nation\r\nthat we brought forth the statesman who, with far-sighted vision,\r\ncould pierce the clouds that obscured the sight of the keenest of his\r\nfellows, could see what the future inevitably held; and moreover that\r\nwe had back of the statesman and behind him the men to whom it was\r\ngiven to fight in the greatest war ever waged for the good of mankind,\r\nfor the betterment of the world.\r\n\r\nI have literally but a moment here. I could not resist the chance that\r\nwas offered me to stop and dedicate this monument, for great though\r\nwe now regard Abraham Lincoln, my countrymen, the future will put him\r\non an even higher pinnacle than we have put him. In all history I do\r\nnot believe that there is to be found an orator whose speeches will\r\nlast as enduringly as certain of the speeches of Lincoln; and in all\r\nhistory, with the sole exception of the man who founded this Republic,\r\nI do not think there will be found another statesman at once so great\r\nand so single-hearted in his devotion to the weal of his people. We\r\ncan not too highly honor him; and the highest way in which we can\r\nhonor him is to see that our homage is not only homage of words; that\r\nto lip loyalty we join the loyalty of the heart; that we pay honor\r\nto the memory of Abraham Lincoln by so conducting ourselves, by so\r\ncarrying ourselves as citizens of this Republic, that we shall hand on\r\nundiminished to our children and our children’s children the heritage\r\nwe received from the men who upheld the statesmanship of Lincoln in\r\nthe council, who made good the soldiership of Grant in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE LINCOLN MONUMENT, SPRINGFIELD, ILL., JUNE 4, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing that the guard around the tomb of Lincoln should be\r\ncomposed of colored soldiers. It was my own good fortune at Santiago\r\nto serve beside colored troops. A man who is good enough to shed\r\nhis blood for the country is good enough to be given a square deal\r\nafterward. More than that no man is entitled to, and less than that no\r\nman shall have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE CONSECRATION OF GRACE MEMORIAL REFORMED CHURCH, WASHINGTON, D.\r\nC., JUNE 7, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall ask your attention to three lines of the Dedication Canticle:\r\n“Serve the Lord with gladness: enter into His gates with thanksgiving,\r\nand into His courts with praise. Who shall ascend into the hill of the\r\nLord? or who shall stand in His holy place? He that hath clean hands,\r\nand a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul with vanity, nor\r\nsworn deceitfully.”\r\n\r\nBetter lines could surely not be brought into any dedication service\r\nof a church; and it is a happy thing that we should have repeated them\r\nthis morning. This church is consecrated to the service of the Lord;\r\nand we can serve Him by the way we serve our fellow-men. This church\r\nis consecrated to service and duty. It was written of old that “by\r\ntheir fruits ye shall know them”; and we can show the faith that is in\r\nus, we can show the sincerity of our devotion, by the fruits we bring\r\nforth. The man who is not a tender and considerate husband, a loving\r\nand wise father, is not serving the Lord when he goes to church; so\r\nwith the woman; so with all who come here. Our being in this church,\r\nour communion here with one another, our sitting under the pastor and\r\nhearing from him the word of God, must, if we are sincere, show their\r\neffects in our lives outside.\r\n\r\nWe of the Dutch and German Reformed Churches, like our brethren of\r\nthe Lutheran Church, have a peculiar duty to perform in this great\r\ncountry of ours, a country still in the making, for we have the duty\r\npeculiarly incumbent upon us to take care of our brethren who come\r\neach year from over seas to our shores. The man going to a new country\r\nis torn by the roots from all his old associations, and there is\r\ngreat danger to him in the time before he gets his roots down into\r\nthe new country, before he brings himself into touch with his fellows\r\nin the new land. For that reason I always take a peculiar interest in\r\nthe attitude of our churches toward the immigrants who come to these\r\nshores. I feel that we should be peculiarly watchful over them,\r\nbecause of our own history, because we or our fathers came here under\r\nlike conditions. Now that we have established ourselves let us see\r\nto it that we stretch out the hand of help, the hand of brotherhood,\r\ntoward the new-comers, and help them as speedily as possible to get\r\ninto such relations that it will be easy for them to walk well in the\r\nnew life. We are not to be excused if we selfishly sit down and enjoy\r\ngifts that have been given to us and do not try to share them with our\r\npoorer fellows coming from every part of the world, who many of them\r\nstand in such need of the helping hand; who often not only meet too\r\nmany people anxious to associate with them for their detriment, but\r\noften too few anxious to associate with them for their good.\r\n\r\nI trust that with the consecration of each new church of the Reformed\r\ncreed in this our country there will be established a fresh centre of\r\neffort to get at and to help for their good the people that yearly\r\ncome from over seas to us. No more important work can be done by our\r\npeople; important to the cause of Christianity, important to the cause\r\nof true national life and greatness here in our own land.\r\n\r\nAnother thing: let us so far as strength is given us make it evident\r\nto those who look on and who are not of us that our faith is not one\r\nof words merely; that it finds expression in deeds. One sad, one\r\nlamentable phase of human history is that the very loftiest words,\r\nimplying the loftiest ideas, have often been used as cloaks for the\r\ncommission of dreadful deeds of iniquity. No more hideous crimes have\r\never been committed by men than those that have been committed in\r\nthe name of liberty, of order, of brotherhood, of religion. People\r\nhave butchered one another under circumstances of dreadful atrocity,\r\nclaiming all the time to be serving the object of the brotherhood of\r\nman or of the fatherhood of God. We must in our lives, in our efforts,\r\nendeavor to further the cause of brotherhood in the human family;\r\nand we must do it in such a way that the men anxious to find subject\r\nfor complaint or derision in the churches of the United States, in\r\nour church, may not be able to find it by pointing out any contrast\r\nbetween our professions and our lives.\r\n\r\nThis church is consecrated to-day to duty and to service, to the\r\nworship of the Creator, and to an earnest effort on our part so to\r\nshape our lives among ourselves and in relation to the outside world\r\nthat we may feel that we have done our part in bringing a little\r\nnearer the day when there shall be on this earth a genuine brotherhood\r\nof man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE SAENGERFEST, BALTIMORE, MD., JUNE 15, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nLet me in the first place congratulate the city of Baltimore upon what\r\nshe has done and upon the way she has done it; and then let me welcome\r\nthe members of the Saengerfest Association and all the guests of\r\nBaltimore this evening. Since the beginning of our country’s history\r\nmany different race strains have entered to make up the composite\r\nAmerican. Out of and from each we have gained something for our\r\nnational character; to each we owe something special for what it has\r\ncontributed to us as a people.\r\n\r\nIt is almost exactly two hundred and twenty years ago that the first\r\nmarked immigration from Germany to what were then the colonies in this\r\nWestern Hemisphere began. As is inevitable with any pioneers those\r\npioneers of the German race on this side of the ocean had to encounter\r\nbitter privation, had to struggle against want in many forms; had\r\nto meet and overcome hardship; for the people that go forth to seek\r\ntheir well-being in strange lands must inevitably be ready to pay as\r\nthe price of success the expenditure of all that there is in them to\r\novercome the obstacles in their way. It was some fifty years later\r\nthat the great tide of German immigration in colonial times began to\r\nflow hither; one of the leaders in it being Muhlenburg, the founder\r\nof a family which has contributed to military and civil life some of\r\nthe worthiest figures in American history. The first of the famous\r\nspeakers of the House of Representatives was Muhlenburg, of German\r\nancestry.\r\n\r\nBaltimore is a centre in that region of our land where from the\r\nearliest days there was that intermingling of ethnic strains which\r\nfinally went to the making of the Americans who in ’76 made this\r\ncountry a nation. Within the boundaries of this State was founded that\r\ncolony which first of all on this western continent saw a government\r\nmodeled upon these principles of religious freedom and toleration\r\nwhich we now regard as the birthrights of American citizens.\r\n\r\nThroughout our career of development the German immigration to this\r\ncountry went steadily onward, and they who came here, and their sons\r\nand grandsons, played an ever-increasing part in the history of our\r\npeople—a part that culminated in the Civil War; for every lover of\r\nthe Union must ever bear in mind what was done in this commonwealth\r\nas in the commonwealth of Missouri, by the folk of German birth or\r\norigin who served so loyally the flag that was theirs by inheritance\r\nor adoption.\r\n\r\nAnd here in this city I would be unwilling to let an occasion like\r\nthis pass without recalling the part of incalculable importance\r\nplayed by the members of the Turn Verein of Baltimore in saving\r\nBaltimore to the Union. In congratulating every man here to whom it\r\nwas given to fight in the great Civil War, in congratulating the men\r\nof Baltimore who in these dark days followed the lead of Sigel, Rapp,\r\nand Blumenberg in playing well and nobly their part in upholding the\r\nhands of Abraham Lincoln, I congratulate them thrice over because it\r\nwas given to them to fight in a contest where the victors and the\r\nvanquished alike have bequeathed to us as a heritage the memory of\r\nthe valor and the loyalty to the right as to each it was given to see\r\nthe right, shown alike by the men who wore the blue and the men who\r\nwore the gray, in the great days of the Civil War. Terrible though\r\nthat contest was, in which with blood and tears and sweat, with the\r\nsuffering of men and the sorrow of women, the generation of Lincoln\r\nand Grant purchased for us peace and union, it paid for itself over\r\nand over again by what it left to us—not merely a reunited land, not\r\nmerely a land in which freedom was a fact instead of only a boast, but\r\nabove all the right as Americans to feel within us the lift toward\r\nlofty things which must come to those who know that their fathers and\r\nforefathers have in the supreme crisis entirely shown themselves fit\r\nto rank among the men of all time.\r\n\r\nI want to say just one thing more. I feel that the men of this\r\nAssociation and of kindred associations are not only adding to the\r\ncommon fund of pleasure, but are doing genuine missionary work\r\nof a needed kind when they hold such a festival as this. I wish\r\nthat everywhere in our country we could see clubs and associations\r\nincluding all our citizens, similar in character to that Society\r\nwhich has furnished the reason for the assembling of this great\r\naudience to-night. No greater contribution to American social life\r\ncould possibly be made than by instilling into it the capacity for\r\nGemüthlichkeit. No greater good can come to our people than to\r\nencourage in them a capacity for enjoyment which shall discriminate\r\nsharply between what is vicious and what is pleasant. Nothing can\r\nadd more to our capacity for healthy social enjoyment than, by force\r\nof example no less than by precept, to encourage the formation of\r\nsocieties which by their cultivation of music, vocal and instrumental,\r\ngive great lift to the artistic side, the æsthetic side of our nature;\r\nand especially is that true when we remember that no man is going to\r\ngo very far wrong if he belongs to a society where he can take his\r\nwife with him to enjoy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA., JUNE 16, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chairman; my Fellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nIt is to me to-day a double pleasure to be with you; in the first\r\nplace, because the University of Virginia is one among that limited\r\nnumber of institutions of learning to which because of its historic\r\nassociation every American proud of his country and his country’s\r\nhistory must turn; and in the next place, because I have just finished\r\na trip to and fro across this continent, which at almost every\r\nstep has reminded me of some great deed done by a Virginian or a\r\ndescendant of a Virginian, in that wonderful formative period which\r\nhas occupied more than half of this Republic’s life; going across\r\nthe Alleghanies in the path over the mountains which men of Virginia\r\nfirst crossed to found the commonwealth of Kentucky; beyond the Ohio,\r\nwhich was crossed by a military force carrying the American flag for\r\nthe first time when a son of Virginia, George Rogers Clark, led his\r\nlittle band of backwoods riflemen to conquer what is now the heart\r\nof this Republic, and that in the middle of the Revolutionary War.\r\nThen I crossed the Mississippi and went through that great region of\r\nprairie, plain, and mountain, now dotted with cities, each filled with\r\nthe fruits of our material civilization, cities placed upon spots\r\nwhich were unknown to any map maker but a century ago; thence to the\r\nPacific Ocean, I went through the regions which mark the two greatest\r\nterritorial expansions of this Nation; the greatest of which, by the\r\nfact of its acquisition, is in itself a tribute most to that man who\r\nfounded this University—President Thomas Jefferson—and which was\r\nexplored by two Virginians born not far from this neighborhood—Lewis\r\nand Clark. When I got south of the limits of the old Louisiana\r\nPurchase I came into that region acquired as the result of the Mexican\r\nWar—the region in territorial extent next to the Louisiana Purchase;\r\nand in that war the two foremost figures were men likewise born in\r\nVirginia—Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott.\r\n\r\nVirginia has always rightly prided herself upon the character of the\r\nmen whom she has sent into public life. No more wonderful example of\r\ngovernmental ability, ability in statecraft and public administration,\r\nhas ever been given than by the history of Virginia’s sons in public\r\nlife. I feel that this University, which so peculiarly embodies the\r\nideal of Virginia, is in no small degree accountable for the happy\r\nkeeping up of the spirit which sends into public life men of whom\r\ntheir constituents exact that they shall possess both courage and\r\ncourtesy; and that is the reason why—as I am glad to say here in the\r\npresence of the two United States Senators from Virginia, both of them\r\ngraduates of this University—whether one agrees or differs with them\r\nit is so genuine a pleasure to be brought into contact with them in\r\nhandling public affairs.\r\n\r\nIn the very able address to which we have had the honor of listening\r\nit is pointed out that in mere years the history of this University is\r\nnot long. Years count differently at different places and at different\r\ntimes. Fifty years of Europe are very much longer than a cycle of\r\nCathay; and the period grows longer still when you take it across into\r\nthe Western Hemisphere. To us of this Nation there must always be the\r\ncharm of old historic associations inseparably connected with this\r\ninstitution, the birth of which will always recall the names of three\r\nof our greatest Presidents, and from which one can wellnigh see the\r\nformer abodes of all three of those Presidents—Jefferson, Madison, and\r\nMonroe.\r\n\r\nLet me acknowledge a piece of personal indebtedness to this\r\ninstitution. When last year we sought at Washington to restore the\r\nWhite House, which ought to be always kept as the historic building\r\nof the Nation, to what it was planned to be by the founders of the\r\nRepublic, we came here to study the building which represented in its\r\nexistence the realization of the ideas of certain of those founders\r\nof the Republic, and gained from our study of a portion of this\r\nUniversity an idea of the plan along which the restoration of the\r\nWhite House was to proceed.\r\n\r\nThe University is not old in years as years are counted in an older\r\nworld, but there are very few institutions of learning in Europe\r\nwhich, however old, have such an honor roll of service to the State,\r\nin the council chambers of the State, and of service on the tented\r\nfield, which have such an honor roll of statesmen and soldiers, as the\r\nroll that can be furnished by reading the list of the graduates of\r\nthis University of Virginia. The University has been prolific of men\r\nwho have gone into public life; but it is not only in public life that\r\nthe record made by the University is imperishable. The strangest, in\r\nsome ways the most brilliant name to be found in American letters, the\r\nname of the man who contributed something purely individual in poetry\r\nand in prose, not merely to the literature of this country, not merely\r\nto the literature of our tongue, but to the literature of mankind—the\r\nname of Edgar Allan Poe, is to be found upon your rolls. It is a\r\npleasure to one who earnestly hopes to see the literary habit in\r\nAmerican life kept up and who hopes to see a keeping up of productive\r\nscholarship and literature, to be able to number among his friends one\r\nof those younger literary men of whom it can be safely asserted that\r\nthey have added something permanent to letters, in the person of one\r\nof your graduates—my friend, Mr. Thomas Nelson Page.\r\n\r\nI owe you for other things. When I wished to choose the Surgeon-General\r\nof the Navy I had to go to Virginia and to the University of Virginia\r\nto find the man whom I esteem, not only because of his ability as a\r\npublic servant, but because of those qualities which will render him\r\never one for whom I and mine feel the warmest and liveliest personal\r\naffection. Finally, when I had to choose an Ambassador to represent\r\nus at the court of Russia, I had to take another graduate of your\r\nUniversity—Mr. McCormick. You will pardon me one personal allusion;\r\nI shall never forget as long as I live certain of your graduates who\r\nserved in my regiment during the Cuban War.\r\n\r\nThe University of Virginia has stood for much in our national life.\r\nIt is something to stand merely for such beauty as your buildings and\r\ncampus represent here. It is a good thing for any nation to have as\r\nbeautiful an institution of learning as is this University. It is a\r\ngood thing for the taste of a nation to have such an example of good\r\ntaste ever before it. You stand for the production of scholarship;\r\nfor the production of men who are to do well for the State if ever\r\nthe need of calling upon them for their services may arise; but above\r\nall, as has been so well said in the address to which we have listened\r\nto-day, the University of Virginia stands for the production of men;\r\nof men who are to do each a man’s duty in the world. A good American\r\nnever owes anything that he does not seek to repay. The man who is\r\ncontent to go through life owing his alma mater for an education for\r\nwhich he has made no adequate return is not true to the ideals of\r\nAmerican citizenship. He is in honor bound to make such return. He\r\ncan make it in but one way; he can return what he owes to his alma\r\nmater only by making his alma mater proud of what he does in service\r\nrendered to his fellow-men. That is the type of return we have the\r\nright to expect of the University men in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HOLY NAME SOCIETY AT OYSTER BAY, N. Y., AUGUST 16, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Very Reverend Dean, Reverend Clergy, and you of the Holy Name\r\nSociety_:\r\n\r\nI count myself fortunate in having the chance to say a word to you\r\nto-day; and at the outset let me, Father Power, on behalf of my\r\nneighbors, your congregation, welcome all your guests here to Oyster\r\nBay. I have a partial right to join in that welcome myself, for it\r\nwas my good fortune in the days of Father Power’s predecessor, Father\r\nBelford, to be the first man to put down a small contribution for the\r\nerection of your church here. I am particularly glad to see such a\r\nsociety as this flourishing as your society has flourished, because\r\nthe future welfare of our Nation depends upon the way in which we can\r\ncombine in our men—in our young men—decency and strength. Just this\r\nmorning when attending service on the great battleship _Kearsarge_\r\nI listened to a sermon addressed to the officers and enlisted men of\r\nthe navy, in which the central thought was that each American must be\r\na good man or he could not be a good citizen. And one of the things\r\ndwelt upon in that sermon was the fact that a man must be clean of\r\nmouth as well as clean of life—must show by his words as well as\r\nby his actions his fealty to the Almighty if he was to be what we\r\nhave a right to expect from men wearing the national uniform. We\r\nhave good Scriptural authority for the statement that it is not what\r\ncomes into a man’s mouth but what goes out of it that counts. I am\r\nnot addressing weaklings, or I should not take the trouble to come\r\nhere. I am addressing strong, vigorous men, who are engaged in the\r\nactive hard work of life; and life to be worth living must be a life\r\nof activity and hard work. I am speaking to men engaged in the hard,\r\nactive work of life, and therefore to men who will count for good or\r\nfor evil. It is peculiarly incumbent upon you who have strength to\r\nset a right example to others. I ask you to remember that you can not\r\nretain your self-respect if you are loose and foul of tongue, that a\r\nman who is to lead a clean and honorable life must inevitably suffer\r\nif his speech likewise is not clean and honorable. Every man here\r\nknows the temptations that beset all of us in this world. At times any\r\nman will slip. I do not expect perfection, but I do expect genuine\r\nand sincere effort toward being decent and cleanly in thought, in\r\nword, and in deed. As I said at the outset, I hail the work of this\r\nsociety as typifying one of those forces which tend to the betterment\r\nand uplifting of our social system. Our whole effort should be toward\r\nsecuring a combination of the strong qualities with those qualities\r\nwhich we term virtues. I expect you to be strong. I would not respect\r\nyou if you were not. I do not want to see Christianity professed only\r\nby weaklings; I want to see it a moving spirit among men of strength.\r\nI do not expect you to lose one particle of your strength or courage\r\nby being decent. On the contrary, I should hope to see each man who\r\nis a member of this society, from his membership in it become all the\r\nfitter to do the rough work of the world; all the fitter to work in\r\ntime of peace; and if, which may Heaven forfend, war should come, all\r\nthe fitter to fight in time of war. I desire to see in this country\r\nthe decent men strong and the strong men decent, and until we get\r\nthat combination in pretty good shape we are not going to be by any\r\nmeans as successful as we should be. There is always a tendency among\r\nvery young men and among boys who are not quite young men as yet to\r\nthink that to be wicked is rather smart; to think it shows that they\r\nare men. Oh, how often you see some young fellow who boasts that he\r\nis going to “see life,” meaning by that that he is going to see that\r\npart of life which it is a thousandfold better should remain unseen!\r\nI ask that every man here constitute himself his brother’s keeper by\r\nsetting an example to that younger brother which will prevent him from\r\ngetting such a false estimate of life. Example is the most potent of\r\nall things. If any one of you in the presence of younger boys, and\r\nespecially the younger people of your own family, misbehave yourself,\r\nif you use coarse and blasphemous language before them, you can be\r\nsure that these younger people will follow your example and not your\r\nprecept. It is no use to preach to them if you do not act decently\r\nyourself. You must feel that the most effective way in which you can\r\npreach is by your practice.\r\n\r\nAs I was driving up here a friend who was with us said that in his\r\nexperience the boy who went out into life with a foul tongue was apt\r\nso to go because his kinsfolk, at least his intimate associates,\r\nthemselves had foul tongues. The father, the elder brothers, the\r\nfriends, can do much toward seeing that the boys as they become men\r\nbecome clean and honorable men.\r\n\r\nI have told you that I wanted you not only to be decent, but to be\r\nstrong. These boys will not admire virtue of a merely anæmic type.\r\nThey believe in courage, in manliness. They admire those who have the\r\nquality of being brave, the quality of facing life as life should be\r\nfaced, the quality that must stand at the root of good citizenship in\r\npeace or in war. If you are to be effective as good Christians you\r\nmust possess strength and courage, or your example will count for\r\nlittle with the young, who admire strength and courage. I want to see\r\nyou, the men of the Holy Name Society, you who embody the qualities\r\nwhich the younger people admire, by your example give those young\r\npeople the tendency, the trend, in the right direction; and remember\r\nthat this example counts in many other ways besides cleanliness of\r\nspeech. I want to see every man able to hold his own with the strong,\r\nand also ashamed to oppress the weak. I want to see each young fellow\r\nable to do a man’s work in the world, and of a type which will not\r\npermit imposition to be practiced upon him. I want to see him too\r\nstrong of spirit to submit to wrong, and, on the other hand, ashamed\r\nto do wrong to others. I want to see each man able to hold his own in\r\nthe rough work of actual life outside, and also, when he is at home,\r\na good man, unselfish in dealing with wife, or mother, or children.\r\nRemember that the preaching does not count if it is not backed up by\r\npractice. There is no good in your preaching to your boys to be brave,\r\nif you run away. There is no good in your preaching to them to tell\r\nthe truth if you do not. There is no good in your preaching to them\r\nto be unselfish if they see you selfish with your wife, disregardful\r\nof others. We have a right to expect that you will come together in\r\nmeetings like this; that you will march in processions; that you will\r\njoin in building up such a great and useful association as this; and,\r\neven more, we have a right to expect that in your own homes and among\r\nyour own associates you will prove by your deeds that yours is not a\r\nlip loyalty merely; that you show in actual practice the faith that is\r\nin you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON BOARD THE _KEARSARGE_, DURING THE REVIEW OF THE FLEET, AUGUST 17,\r\n1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Officers and Enlisted Men_:\r\n\r\nI wish to say a word of thanks to you on behalf of the people of the\r\nUnited States. There are many public servants whom I hold in high\r\nesteem, but there are no others whom as a class I hold in quite the\r\nesteem I do the officers and enlisted men of the navy and the army of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIn doing your work here it should all be done with an eye toward the\r\nday when upon every man, from the admiral to the lowest in rank, may\r\nrest the responsibility as to whether or not a new page of honor\r\nin American history shall be turned. As I passed the _Olympia_ I\r\nremembered her victory of May 1, 1898, which made her name forever\r\none of renown in our history. But all aboard her had been equipped\r\nfor the work by days and months, usually by years, of what must have\r\noften been irksome duty. In speaking to all of you I want a chance to\r\nsay a word of special recognition to the gun pointers. The shots that\r\nhit are the shots that tell. They are what make the navy prove itself\r\nequal to any need. I am happy to say that the American seamen have\r\nnever been found deficient in the fighting edge—the first requisite\r\nof the fighting man. I do not praise you for being brave; that is\r\nexpected. The coward is to be condemned rather than the brave man to\r\nbe praised. I expect every one to show a perfect willingness to die\r\nrather than to see the slightest stain put upon the American flag. But\r\nin addition you must know how to use to the utmost advantage the gear\r\nand the weapons. You must know how to fight as well as know how to\r\ndie; only thus can you become the most efficient fighting force in the\r\nworld. I again thank you for what you are. A peculiar responsibility\r\nattaches to each and every one of you. It has been a pleasure to see\r\nthe ship and the guns, but, above all, the men behind the guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON BOARD THE _OLYMPIA_ DURING THE REVIEW OF THE FLEET, AUGUST 17, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\nAs President of the United States, I wish, on behalf of the entire\r\ncountry, to greet you as representatives of the officers and enlisted\r\nmen of the United States Navy. Every man aboard the _Olympia_ must\r\nfeel that on him rests a double duty, to see to it that the ship’s\r\nname shall be for evermore a symbol of victory and of glory to all\r\nthe people of our country. Nothing pleases me more than to see\r\nto-day for myself how high is the standard of the enlisted men of\r\nthe United States Navy. I do not believe that our navy has ever been\r\nat a higher point of efficiency. Month by month the already high\r\nstandard is being raised even higher. All alike share in the duty,\r\nand share in the honor which comes if the duty is well done. Whether\r\nthe service is rendered in the conning tower, or in the gun-turrets,\r\nor in the engine-room, it matters not, so long as the service itself\r\nis of the highest possible kind. This ship commemorates forever\r\nthe name of Admiral Dewey, as the _Hartford_ commemorates that of\r\nAdmiral Farragut. And I ask you all, as Americans proud of your\r\ncountry, from the admiral down to the last enlisted landsman, or the\r\nyoungest apprentice, to appreciate alike the high honor and heavy\r\nresponsibility of your positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE STATE FAIR, SYRACUSE, N. Y., SEPTEMBER 7, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Governor Higgins; my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nIn speaking on Labor Day at the annual fair of the New York State\r\nAgricultural Association, it is natural to keep especially in mind\r\nthe two bodies who compose the majority of our people and upon whose\r\nwelfare depends the welfare of the entire State. If circumstances\r\nare such that thrift, energy, industry, and forethought enable the\r\nfarmer, the tiller of the soil, on the one hand, and the wage-worker,\r\non the other, to keep themselves, their wives, and their children in\r\nreasonable comfort, then the State is well off, and we can be assured\r\nthat the other classes in the community will likewise prosper. On the\r\nother hand, if there is in the long run a lack of prosperity among\r\nthe two classes named, then all other prosperity is sure to be more\r\nseeming than real. It has been our profound good fortune as a Nation\r\nthat hitherto, disregarding exceptional periods of depression and\r\nthe normal and inevitable fluctuations, there has been on the whole\r\nfrom the beginning of our government to the present day a progressive\r\nbetterment alike in the condition of the tiller of the soil and in\r\nthe condition of the man who, by his manual skill and labor, supports\r\nhimself and his family, and endeavors to bring up his children so\r\nthat they may be at least as well off as, and if possible better off\r\nthan, he himself has been. There are, of course, exceptions, but as\r\na whole the standard of living among the farmers of our country has\r\nrisen from generation to generation, and the wealth represented on the\r\nfarms has steadily increased, while the wages of labor have likewise\r\nrisen, both as regards the actual money paid and as regards the\r\npurchasing power which that money represents.\r\n\r\nSide by side with this increase in the prosperity of the wage-worker\r\nand the tiller of the soil has gone on a great increase in prosperity\r\namong the business men and among certain classes of professional\r\nmen; and the prosperity of these men has been partly the cause and\r\npartly the consequence of the prosperity of farmer and wage-worker.\r\nIt can not be too often repeated that in this country, in the long\r\nrun, we all of us tend to go up or go down together. If the average\r\nof well-being is high, it means that the average wage-worker, the\r\naverage farmer, and the average business man are all alike well off.\r\nIf the average shrinks, there is not one of these classes which will\r\nnot feel the shrinkage. Of course there are always some men who are\r\nnot affected by good times, just as there are some men who are not\r\naffected by bad times. But speaking broadly, it is true that if\r\nprosperity comes all of us tend to share more or less therein, and\r\nthat if adversity comes each of us, to a greater or less extent, feels\r\nthe tension. Unfortunately, in this world the innocent frequently\r\nfind themselves obliged to pay some of the penalty for the misdeeds\r\nof the guilty; and so if hard times come, whether they be due to our\r\nown fault or to our misfortune, whether they be due to some burst of\r\nspeculative frenzy that has caused a portion of the business world\r\nto lose its head—a loss which no legislation can possibly supply—or\r\nwhether they be due to any lack of wisdom in a portion of the world of\r\nlabor—in each case the trouble once started is felt more or less in\r\nevery walk of life.\r\n\r\nIt is all-essential to the continuance of our healthy national life\r\nthat we should recognize this community of interest among our people.\r\nThe welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally upon the welfare\r\nof all of us, and therefore in public life that man is the best\r\nrepresentative of each of us who seeks to do good to each by doing\r\ngood to all; in other words, whose endeavor it is, not to represent\r\nany special class and promote merely that class’s selfish interests,\r\nbut to represent all true and honest men of all sections and all\r\nclasses and to work for their interests by working for our common\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe can keep our government on a sane and healthy basis, we can make\r\nand keep our social system what it should be, only on condition of\r\njudging each man, not as a member of a class, but on his worth as a\r\nman. It is an infamous thing in our American life, and fundamentally\r\ntreacherous to our institutions, to apply to any man any test save\r\nthat of his personal worth, or to draw between two sets of men any\r\ndistinction save the distinction of conduct, the distinction that\r\nmarks off those who do well and wisely from those who do ill and\r\nfoolishly. There are good citizens and bad citizens in every class\r\nas in every locality, and the attitude of decent people toward\r\ngreat public and social questions should be determined, not by the\r\naccidental questions of employment or locality, but by those deep-set\r\nprinciples which represent the innermost souls of men.\r\n\r\nThe failure in public and in private life thus to treat each man on\r\nhis own merits, the recognition of this government as being either\r\nfor the poor as such or for the rich as such, would prove fatal to\r\nour Republic, as such failure and such recognition have always proved\r\nfatal in the past to other republics. A healthy republican government\r\nmust rest upon individuals, not upon classes or sections. As soon as\r\nit becomes government by a class or by a section it departs from the\r\nold American ideal.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, the merest truism to say that free institutions\r\nare of avail only to people who possess the high and peculiar\r\ncharacteristics needed to take advantage of such institutions. The\r\ncentury that has just closed has witnessed many and lamentable\r\ninstances in which people have seized a government free in form, or\r\nhave had it bestowed upon them, and yet have permitted it under the\r\nforms of liberty to become some species of despotism or anarchy,\r\nbecause they did not have in them the power to make this seeming\r\nliberty one of deed instead of one merely of word. Under such\r\ncircumstances the seeming liberty may be supplanted by a tyranny or\r\ndespotism in the first place, or it may reach the road of despotism\r\nby the path of license and anarchy. It matters but little which\r\nroad is taken. In either case the same goal is reached. People show\r\nthemselves just as unfit for liberty whether they submit to anarchy\r\nor to tyranny; and class government, whether it be the government of\r\na plutocracy or the government of a mob, is equally incompatible with\r\nthe principles established in the days of Washington and perpetuated\r\nin the days of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nMany qualities are needed by a people which would preserve the power\r\nof self-government in fact as well as in name. Among these qualities\r\nare forethought, shrewdness, self-restraint, the courage which refuses\r\nto abandon one’s own rights, and the disinterested and kindly good\r\nsense which enables one to do justice to the rights of others. Lack\r\nof strength and lack of courage unfit men for self-government on the\r\none hand; and on the other, brutal arrogance, envy, in short, any\r\nmanifestation of the spirit of selfish disregard, whether of one’s own\r\nduties or of the rights of others, are equally fatal.\r\n\r\nIn the history of mankind many republics have risen, have flourished\r\nfor a less or greater time, and then have fallen because their\r\ncitizens lost the power of governing themselves and thereby of\r\ngoverning their state; and in no way has this loss of power been so\r\noften and so clearly shown as in the tendency to turn the government\r\ninto a government primarily for the benefit of one class instead of a\r\ngovernment for the benefit of the people as a whole.\r\n\r\nAgain and again in the republics of ancient Greece, in those of\r\nmediæval Italy and mediæval Flanders, this tendency was shown, and\r\nwherever the tendency became a habit it invariably and inevitably\r\nproved fatal to the state. In the final result it mattered not one\r\nwhit whether the movement was in favor of one class or of another.\r\nThe outcome was equally fatal, whether the country fell into the\r\nhands of a wealthy oligarchy which exploited the poor or whether it\r\nfell under the domination of a turbulent mob which plundered the\r\nrich. In both cases there resulted violent alternations between\r\ntyranny and disorder, and a final complete loss of liberty to all\r\ncitizens—destruction in the end overtaking the class which had for\r\nthe moment been victorious as well as that which had momentarily been\r\ndefeated. The death knell of the Republic had rung as soon as the\r\nactive power became lodged in the hands of those who sought, not to\r\ndo justice to all citizens, rich and poor alike, but to stand for one\r\nspecial class and for its interests as opposed to the interests of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe reason why our future is assured lies in the fact that our people\r\nare genuinely skilled in and fitted for self-government and therefore\r\nwill spurn the leadership of those who seek to excite this ferocious\r\nand foolish class antagonism. The average American knows not only\r\nthat he himself intends to do about what is right, but that his\r\naverage fellow-countryman has the same intention and the same power\r\nto make his intention effective. He knows, whether he be business\r\nman, professional man, farmer, mechanic, employer, or wage-worker,\r\nthat the welfare of each of these men is bound up with the welfare of\r\nall the others; that each is neighbor to the other, is actuated by\r\nthe same hopes and fears, has fundamentally the same ideals, and that\r\nall alike have much the same virtues and the same faults. Our average\r\nfellow-citizen is a sane and healthy man, who believes in decency and\r\nhas a wholesome mind. He therefore feels an equal scorn alike for the\r\nman of wealth guilty of the mean and base spirit of arrogance toward\r\nthose who are less well off, and for the man of small means who in his\r\nturn either feels, or seeks to excite in others the feeling of mean\r\nand base envy for those who are better off. The two feelings, envy and\r\narrogance, are but opposite sides of the same shield, but different\r\ndevelopments of the same spirit. Fundamentally, the unscrupulous rich\r\nman who seeks to exploit and oppress those who are less well off is\r\nin spirit not opposed to, but identical with, the unscrupulous poor\r\nman who desires to plunder and oppress those who are better off. The\r\ncourtier and the demagogue are but developments of the same type\r\nunder different conditions, each manifesting the same servile spirit,\r\nthe same desire to rise by pandering to base passions; though one\r\npanders to power in the shape of a single man and the other to power\r\nin the shape of a multitude. So likewise the man who wishes to rise\r\nby wronging others must by right be contrasted, not with the man who\r\nlikewise wishes to do wrong, though to a different set of people, but\r\nwith the man who wishes to do justice to all people and to wrong none.\r\n\r\nThe line of cleavage between good and bad citizenship lies, not\r\nbetween the man of wealth who acts squarely by his fellows and the\r\nman who seeks each day’s wage by that day’s work, wronging no one and\r\ndoing his duty by his neighbor; nor yet does this line of cleavage\r\ndivide the unscrupulous wealthy man who exploits others in his own\r\ninterest, from the demagogue, or from the sullen and envious being who\r\nwishes to attack all men of property, whether they do well or ill.\r\nOn the contrary, the line of cleavage between good citizenship and\r\nbad citizenship separates the rich man who does well from the rich\r\nman who does ill, the poor man of good conduct from the poor man of\r\nbad conduct. This line of cleavage lies at right angles to any such\r\narbitrary line of division as that separating one class from another,\r\none locality from another, or men with a certain degree of property\r\nfrom those of a less degree of property.\r\n\r\nThe good citizen is the man who, whatever his wealth or his poverty,\r\nstrives manfully to do his duty to himself, to his family, to his\r\nneighbor, to the State; who is incapable of the baseness which\r\nmanifests itself either in arrogance or in envy, but who while\r\ndemanding justice for himself is no less scrupulous to do justice to\r\nothers. It is because the average American citizen, rich or poor, is\r\nof just this type that we have cause for our profound faith in the\r\nfuture of the Republic.\r\n\r\nOurs is a government of liberty, by, through, and under the law.\r\nLawlessness and connivance at law-breaking—whether the law-breaking\r\ntake the form of a crime of greed and cunning or of a crime of\r\nviolence—are destructive not only of order, but of the true liberties\r\nwhich can only come through order. If alive to their true interests\r\nrich and poor alike will set their faces like flint against the spirit\r\nwhich seeks personal advantage by overriding the laws, without regard\r\nto whether this spirit shows itself in the form of bodily violence by\r\none set of men or in the form of vulpine cunning by another set of men.\r\n\r\nLet the watchwords of all our people be the old familiar watchwords of\r\nhonesty, decency, fair dealing and common-sense. The qualities denoted\r\nby these words are essential to all of us, as we deal with the complex\r\nindustrial problems of to-day, the problems affecting not merely the\r\naccumulation but even more the wise distribution of wealth. We ask\r\nno man’s permission when we require him to obey the law; neither the\r\npermission of the poor man nor yet of the rich man. Least of all can\r\nthe man of great wealth afford to break the law, even for his own\r\nfinancial advantage; for the law is his prop and support, and it is\r\nboth foolish and profoundly unpatriotic for him to fail in giving\r\nhearty support to those who show that there is in very fact one law,\r\nand one law only, alike for the rich and the poor, for the great and\r\nthe small.\r\n\r\nMen sincerely interested in the due protection of property, and men\r\nsincerely interested in seeing that the just rights of labor are\r\nguaranteed, should alike remember not only that in the long run\r\nneither the capitalist nor the wage-worker can be helped in healthy\r\nfashion save by helping the other; but also that to require either\r\nside to obey the law and do its full duty toward the community is\r\nemphatically to that side’s real interest.\r\n\r\nThere is no worse enemy of the wage-worker than the man who condones\r\nmob violence in any shape or who preaches class hatred; and surely the\r\nslightest acquaintance with our industrial history should teach even\r\nthe most shortsighted that the times of most suffering for our people\r\nas a whole, the times when business is stagnant, and capital suffers\r\nfrom shrinkage and gets no return from its investments, are exactly\r\nthe times of hardship, and want, and grim disaster among the poor.\r\nIf all the existing instrumentalities of wealth could be abolished,\r\nthe first and severest suffering would come among those of us who are\r\nleast well off at present. The wage-worker is well off only when the\r\nrest of the country is well off; and he can best contribute to this\r\ngeneral well-being by showing sanity and a firm purpose to do justice\r\nto others.\r\n\r\nIn his turn the capitalist who is really a conservative, the man\r\nwho has forethought as well as patriotism, should heartily welcome\r\nevery effort, legislative or otherwise, which has for its object to\r\nsecure fair dealing by capital, corporate or individual, toward the\r\npublic and toward the employee. Such laws as the franchise tax law in\r\nthis State, which the Court of Appeals recently unanimously decided\r\nconstitutional—such a law as that passed in Congress last year for\r\nthe purpose of establishing a Department of Commerce and Labor,\r\nunder which there should be a bureau to oversee and secure publicity\r\nfrom the great corporations which do an interstate business—such a\r\nlaw as that passed at the same time for the regulation of the great\r\nhighways of commerce so as to keep these roads clear on fair terms to\r\nall producers in getting their goods to market—these laws are in the\r\ninterest not merely of the people as a whole, but of the propertied\r\nclasses. For in no way is the stability of property better assured\r\nthan by making it patent to our people that property bears its proper\r\nshare of the burdens of the State; that property is handled not\r\nonly in the interest of the owner, but in the interest of the whole\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIn other words, legislation to be permanently good for any class must\r\nalso be good for the Nation as a whole, and legislation which does\r\ninjustice to any class is certain to work harm to the Nation. Take\r\nour currency system for example. This Nation is on a gold basis. The\r\ntreasury of the public is in excellent condition. Never before has the\r\nper capita of circulation been as large as it is this day; and this\r\ncirculation, moreover, is of money every dollar of which is at par\r\nwith gold. Now, our having this sound currency system is of benefit to\r\nbanks, of course, but it is of infinitely more benefit to the people\r\nas a whole, because of the healthy effect on business conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, whatever is advisable in the way of remedial or\r\ncorrective currency legislation—and nothing revolutionary is advisable\r\nunder present conditions—must be undertaken only from the standpoint\r\nof the business community as a whole, that is, of the American body\r\npolitic as a whole. Whatever is done, we can not afford to take any\r\nstep backward or to cast any doubt upon the certain redemption in\r\nstandard coin of every circulating note.\r\n\r\nAmong ourselves we differ in many qualities of body, head and heart;\r\nwe are unequally developed, mentally as well as physically. But each\r\nof us has the right to ask that he shall be protected from wrongdoing\r\nas he does his work and carries his burden through life. No man needs\r\nsympathy because he has to work, because he has a burden to carry. Far\r\nand away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard\r\nat work worth doing; and this is a prize open to every man, for there\r\ncan be no work better worth doing than that done to keep in health and\r\ncomfort and with reasonable advantages those immediately dependent\r\nupon the husband, the father, or the son.\r\n\r\nThere is no room in our healthy American life for the mere idler, for\r\nthe man or the woman whose object it is throughout life to shirk the\r\nduties which life ought to bring. Life can mean nothing worth meaning,\r\nunless its prime aim is the doing of duty, the achievement of results\r\nworth achieving. A recent writer has finely said: “After all, the\r\nsaddest thing that can happen to a man is to carry no burdens. To be\r\nbent under too great a load is bad; to be crushed by it is lamentable;\r\nbut even in that there are possibilities that are glorious. But to\r\ncarry no load at all—there is nothing in that. No one seems to arrive\r\nat any goal really worth reaching in this world who does not come to\r\nit heavy laden.”\r\n\r\nSurely from our own experience each one of us knows that this is\r\ntrue. From the greatest to the smallest, happiness and usefulness\r\nare largely found in the same soul, and the joy of life is won in\r\nits deepest and truest sense only by those who have not shirked\r\nlife’s burdens. The men whom we most delight to honor in all this\r\nland are those who, in the iron years from ’61 to ’65, bore on their\r\nshoulders the burden of saving the Union. They did not choose the\r\neasy task. They did not shirk the difficult duty. Deliberately and\r\nof their own free will they strove for an ideal, upward and onward\r\nacross the stony slopes of greatness. They did the hardest work\r\nthat was then to be done; they bore the heaviest burden that any\r\ngeneration of Americans ever had to bear; and because they did this\r\nthey have won such proud joy as it has fallen to the lot of no other\r\nmen to win, and have written their names for evermore on the golden\r\nhonor roll of the Nation. As it is with the soldier, so it is with\r\nthe civilian. To win success in the business world, to become a\r\nfirst-class mechanic, a successful farmer, an able lawyer or doctor,\r\nmeans that the man has devoted his best energy and power through\r\nlong years to the achievement of his ends. So it is in the life of\r\nthe family, upon which in the last analysis the whole welfare of the\r\nNation rests. The man or woman who as bread-winner and home-maker, or\r\nas wife and mother, has done all that he or she can do, patiently and\r\nuncomplainingly, is to be honored; and is to be envied by all those\r\nwho have never had the good fortune to feel the need and duty of doing\r\nsuch work. The woman who has borne, and who has reared as they should\r\nbe reared, a family of children, has in the most emphatic manner\r\ndeserved well of the Republic. Her burden has been heavy, and she has\r\nbeen able to bear it worthily only by the possession of resolution,\r\nof good sense, of conscience, and of unselfishness. But if she has\r\nborne it well, then to her shall come the supreme blessing, for in the\r\nwords of the oldest and greatest of books, “Her children shall rise\r\nup and call her blessed;” and among the benefactors of the land her\r\nplace must be with those who have done the best and the hardest work,\r\nwhether as law-givers or as soldiers, whether in public or private\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThis is not a soft and easy creed to preach. It is a creed willingly\r\nlearned only by men and women who, together with the softer virtues,\r\npossess also the stronger; who can do, and dare, and die at need,\r\nbut who while life lasts will never flinch from their allotted task.\r\nYou farmers, and wage-workers, and business men of this great State,\r\nof this mighty and wonderful Nation, are gathered together to-day,\r\nproud of your State and still prouder of your Nation, because your\r\nforefathers and predecessors have lived up to just this creed. You\r\nhave received from their hands a great inheritance, and you will leave\r\nan even greater inheritance to your children, and your children’s\r\nchildren, provided only that you practice alike in your private and\r\nyour public lives the strong virtues that have given us as a people\r\ngreatness in the past. It is not enough to be well-meaning and kindly,\r\nbut weak; neither is it enough to be strong, unless morality and\r\ndecency go hand in hand with strength. We must possess the qualities\r\nwhich make us do our duty in our homes and among our neighbors, and in\r\naddition we must possess the qualities which are indispensable to the\r\nmake-up of every great and masterful nation—the qualities of courage\r\nand hardihood, of individual initiative and yet of power to combine\r\nfor a common end, and above all, the resolute determination to permit\r\nno man and no set of men to sunder us one from the other by lines\r\nof caste or creed or section. We must act upon the motto of all for\r\neach and each for all. There must be ever present in our minds the\r\nfundamental truth that in a republic such as ours the only safety is\r\nto stand neither for nor against any man because he is rich or because\r\nhe is poor, because he is engaged in one occupation or another,\r\nbecause he works with his brains or because he works with his hands.\r\nWe must treat each man on his worth and merits as a man. We must see\r\nthat each is given a square deal, because he is entitled to no more\r\nand should receive no less. Finally we must keep ever in mind that a\r\nrepublic such as ours can exist only by virtue of the orderly liberty\r\nwhich comes through the equal domination of the law over all men\r\nalike, and through its administration in such resolute and fearless\r\nfashion as shall teach all that no man is above it and no man below it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT RICHMOND HILL, N. Y., SEPTEMBER 8, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. Kimball, and you, Men, Women, and Children of Richmond Hill_:\r\n\r\nI wish I could talk better to all of you; but I will ask you to have a\r\nlittle patience for one moment while I thank you for having come out\r\nto greet me, I am glad to see all of you, and allow me to say that I\r\nam most glad to see those who carry small folks in their arms.\r\n\r\nYou know I am very fond of Mr. Riis; and the reason why is because\r\nwhen I preach about decent citizenship I can turn to him and think\r\nhe has practiced just what I have been preaching. The worth of any\r\nsermon lies in the way in which that sermon can be and is applied\r\nin practice. Of course I am glad to have the chance of being with a\r\nman who shows by his life that he knows how practically to apply the\r\nspirit of decency unaccompanied by mournfulness or false pretences\r\nof any kind, or by weakness. I want to see men decent; I want to\r\nsee them act squarely; I want to see them work. That does not mean\r\nthat I want to see them have sour faces. I want to see all enjoy\r\nthemselves, men, women, and children. I believe in play; I believe in\r\nhappiness, and in the joy of living; and I do not believe in the life\r\nthat is nothing but play. I believe that you have a thousandfold more\r\nenjoyment if work comes first; but get time to play also. I believe\r\nin cheerfulness as well as in decency and honesty. Finally, I believe\r\nin always combining strength with the sweetness. I want to say how\r\ndeeply touched I am at your coming out to greet me, and I want you to\r\nunderstand that you give me strength of heart when you come in this\r\nway. I greet you all; I am glad to see the grown up people of Richmond\r\nHill, and I am even more glad to see the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT ANTIETAM, MD., SEPTEMBER 17, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Governor Murphy, Veterans of New Jersey, Men of the Grand Army_:\r\n\r\nI thank you of New Jersey for the monument to the troops of New\r\nJersey who fought at Antietam, and on behalf of the Nation I accept\r\nthe gift. We meet to-day upon one of the great battle-fields of the\r\nCivil War. No other battle of the Civil War lasting but one day shows\r\nas great a percentage of loss as that which occurred here upon the\r\nday on which Antietam was fought. Moreover, in its ultimate effects\r\nthis battle was of momentous and even decisive importance, for when\r\nit had ended and Lee had retreated south of the Potomac, Lincoln\r\nforthwith published that immortal paper, the preliminary declaration\r\nof emancipation; the paper which decided that the Civil War, besides\r\nbeing a war for the preservation of the Union, should be a war for the\r\nemancipation of the slave, so that from that time onward the cause of\r\nUnion and of Freedom, of national greatness and individual liberty,\r\nwere one and the same.\r\n\r\nMen of New Jersey, I congratulate your State because she has the right\r\nto claim her full share in the honor and glory of that memorable day;\r\nand I congratulate you, Governor Murphy, because on that day you had\r\nthe high good fortune to serve as a lad with credit and honor in\r\none of the five regiments which your State sent to the battle. Four\r\nof those regiments, by the way, served in the division commanded\r\nby that gallant soldier, Henry W. Slocum, whom we of New York can\r\nclaim as our own. The other regiment, that in which Governor Murphy\r\nserved, although practically an entirely new regiment, did work as\r\ngood as that of any veteran organization upon the field, and suffered\r\na proportional loss. This regiment was at one time ordered to the\r\nsupport of a division commanded by another New York soldier, the\r\ngallant General Greene, whose son himself served as a major-general\r\nin the war with Spain and is now, as Police Commissioner of New York,\r\nrendering as signal service in civil life as he had already rendered\r\nin military life.\r\n\r\nIf the issue of Antietam had been other than it was, it is probable\r\nthat at least two great European powers would have recognized the\r\nindependence of the Confederacy; so that you who fought here forty-one\r\nyears ago have the profound satisfaction of feeling that you played\r\nwell your part in one of those crises big with the fate of all\r\nmankind. You men of the Grand Army by your victory not only rendered\r\nall Americans your debtors for evermore, but you rendered all humanity\r\nyour debtors. If the Union had been dissolved, if the great edifice\r\nbuilt with blood and sweat and tears by mighty Washington and his\r\ncompeers had gone down in wreck and ruin, the result would have been\r\nan incalculable calamity, not only for our people—and most of all\r\nfor those who, in such event would have seemingly triumphed—but for\r\nall mankind. The great American Republic would have become a memory\r\nof derision; and the failure of the experiment of self-government\r\nby a great people on a great scale would have delighted the heart\r\nof every foe of republican institutions. Our country, now so great\r\nand so wonderful, would have been split into little jangling rival\r\nnationalities, each with a history both bloody and contemptible.\r\nIt was because you, the men who wear the button of the Grand Army,\r\ntriumphed in those dark years, that every American now holds his\r\nhead high, proud in the knowledge that he belongs to a Nation whose\r\nglorious past and great present will be succeeded by an even mightier\r\nfuture; whereas had you failed we would all of us, North and South,\r\nEast and West, be now treated by other nations at the best with\r\ncontemptuous tolerance; at the worst with overbearing insolence.\r\n\r\nMoreover, every friend of liberty, every believer in self-government,\r\nevery idealist who wished to see his ideals take practical shape,\r\nwherever he might be in the world, knew that the success of all in\r\nwhich he most believed was bound up with the success of the Union\r\narmies in this great struggle. I confidently predict that when the\r\nfinal judgment of history is recorded it will be said that in no other\r\nwar of which we have written record was it more vitally essential\r\nfor the welfare of mankind that victory should rest where it finally\r\nrested. There have been other wars for individual freedom. There have\r\nbeen other wars for national greatness. But there has never been\r\nanother war in which the issues at stake were so large, looked at from\r\neither standpoint. We take just pride in the great deeds of the men\r\nof 1776, but we must keep in mind that the Revolutionary War would\r\nhave been shorn of wellnigh all its results had the side of union and\r\nliberty been defeated in the Civil War. In such case we should merely\r\nhave added another to the lamentably long list of cases in which\r\npeoples have shown that after winning their liberty they are wholly\r\nunable to make good use of it.\r\n\r\nIt now rests with us in civil life to make good by our deeds the\r\ndeeds which you who wore the blue did in the great years from ’61\r\nto ’65. The patriotism, the courage, the unflinching resolution and\r\nsteadfast endurance of the soldiers whose triumph was crowned at\r\nAppomattox must be supplemented on our part by civic courage, civic\r\nhonesty, cool sanity, and steadfast adherence to the immutable laws\r\nof righteousness. You left us a reunited country; reunited in fact\r\nas well as in name. You left us the right of brotherhood with your\r\ngallant foes who wore the gray; the right to feel pride in their\r\ncourage and their high fealty to an ideal, even though they warred\r\nagainst the stars in their courses. You left us also the most splendid\r\nexample of what brotherhood really means; for in your careers you\r\nshowed in practical fashion that the only safety in our American life\r\nlies in spurning the accidental distinctions which sunder one man from\r\nanother, and in paying homage to each man only because of what he\r\nessentially is; in stripping off the husks of occupation, of position,\r\nof accident, until the soul stands forth revealed, and we know the man\r\nonly because of his worth as a man.\r\n\r\nThere was no patent device for securing victory by force of arms\r\nforty years ago; and there is no patent device for securing victory\r\nfor the forces of righteousness in civil life now. In each case the\r\nall-important factor was and is the character of the individual man.\r\nGood laws in the State, like a good organization in an army, are\r\nthe expressions of national character. Leaders will be developed in\r\nmilitary and in civil life alike; and weapons and tactics change from\r\ngeneration to generation, as methods of achieving good government\r\nchange in civic affairs; but the fundamental qualities which make for\r\ngood citizenship do not change any more than the fundamental qualities\r\nwhich make good soldiers. In the long run in the Civil War the thing\r\nthat counted for more than aught else was the fact that the average\r\nAmerican had the fighting edge; had within him the spirit which\r\nspurred him on through toil and danger, fatigue and hardship, to the\r\ngoal of the splendid ultimate triumph. So in achieving good government\r\nthe fundamental factor must be the character of the average citizen;\r\nthat average citizen’s power of hatred for what is mean and base and\r\nunlovely; his fearless scorn of cowardice and his determination to war\r\nunyieldingly against the dark and sordid forces of evil.\r\n\r\nThe Continental troops who followed Washington were clad in blue\r\nand buff, and were armed with clumsy, flintlock muskets. You, who\r\nfollowed Grant, wore the famous old blue uniform, and your weapons\r\nhad changed as had your uniform; and now the men of the American Army\r\nwho uphold the honor of the flag in the far tropic lands are yet\r\ndifferently armed and differently clad and differently trained; but\r\nthe spirit that has driven you all to victory has remained forever\r\nunchanged. So it is in civil life. As you did not win in a month or\r\na year, but only after long years of hard and dangerous work, so the\r\nfight for governmental honesty and efficiency can be won only by\r\nthe display of similar patience and similar resolution and power of\r\nendurance. We need the same type of character now that was needed\r\nby the men who with Washington first inaugurated the system of free\r\npopular government, the system of combined liberty and order here\r\non this Continent; that was needed by the men who under Lincoln\r\nperpetuated the government which had thus been inaugurated in the\r\ndays of Washington. The qualities essential to good citizenship and\r\nto good public service now are in all their essentials exactly the\r\nsame as in the days when the first Congresses met to provide for the\r\nestablishment of the Union; as in the days seventy years later, when\r\nthe Congresses met which had to provide for its salvation.\r\n\r\nThere are many qualities which we need alike in private citizen\r\nand in public man, but three above all—three for the lack of which\r\nno brilliancy and no genius can atone—and those three are courage,\r\nhonesty, and common-sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE UNVEILING OF THE SHERMAN STATUE, WASHINGTON, D. C., OCTOBER 15,\r\n1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Dodge, Veterans of the Four Great Armies, and you, my\r\nFellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nTo-day we meet together to do honor to the memory of one of the great\r\nmen whom, in the hour of her agony, our Nation brought forth for her\r\npreservation. The Civil War was not only in the importance of the\r\nissues at stake and of the outcome the greatest of modern times, but\r\nit was also, taking into account its duration, the severity of the\r\nfighting, and the size of the armies engaged, the greatest since\r\nthe close of the Napoleonic struggles. Among the generals who rose\r\nto high position as leaders of the various armies in the field are\r\nmany who will be remembered in our history as long as this history\r\nitself is remembered. Sheridan, the incarnation of fiery energy and\r\nprowess; Thomas, far-sighted, cool-headed, whose steadfast courage\r\nburned ever highest in the supreme moment of the crisis; McClellan,\r\nwith his extraordinary gift for organization; Meade, victor in one of\r\nthe decisive battles of all time; Hancock, type of the true fighting\r\nman among the regulars; Logan, type of the true fighting man among\r\nthe volunteers—the names of these and of many others will endure so\r\nlong as our people hold sacred the memory of the fight for union and\r\nfor liberty. High among these chiefs rise the figures of Grant and of\r\nGrant’s great lieutenant, Sherman, whose statue here in the national\r\ncapital is to-day to be unveiled. It is not necessary here to go\r\nover the long roll of Sherman’s mighty feats. They are written large\r\nthroughout the history of the Civil War. Our memories would be poor\r\nindeed if we did not recall them now, as we look along Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue and think of the great triumphal march which surged down its\r\nlength when at the close of the war the victorious armies of the East\r\nand of the West met here in the capital of the Nation they had saved.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar fitness in commemorating the great deeds of the\r\nsoldiers who preserved this Nation, by suitable monuments at the\r\nNational Capital. I trust we shall soon have a proper statue of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, to whom more than to any other one man this Nation\r\nowes its salvation. Meanwhile, on behalf of the people of the Nation,\r\nI wish to congratulate all of you who have been instrumental in\r\nsecuring the erection of this statue to General Sherman.\r\n\r\nThe living can best show their respect for the memory of the great\r\ndead by the way in which they take to heart and act upon the lessons\r\ntaught by the lives which made these dead men great. Our homage to-day\r\nto the memory of Sherman comes from the depths of our being. We would\r\nbe unworthy citizens did we not feel profound gratitude toward him,\r\nand those like him and under him, who, when the country called in her\r\ndire need, sprang forward with such gallant eagerness to answer that\r\ncall. Their blood and their toil, their endurance and patriotism,\r\nhave made us and all who come after us forever their debtors. They\r\nleft us not merely a reunited country, but a country incalculably\r\ngreater because of its rich heritage in the deeds which thus left it\r\nreunited. As a Nation we are the greater, not only for the valor and\r\ndevotion to duty displayed by the men in blue, who won in the great\r\nstruggle for the Union, but also for the valor and the loyalty toward\r\nwhat they regarded as right of the men in gray; for this war, thrice\r\nfortunate above all other recent wars in its outcome, left to all of\r\nus the right of brotherhood alike with valiant victor and valiant\r\nvanquished.\r\n\r\nMoreover, our homage must not only find expression on our lips; it\r\nmust also show itself forth in our deeds. It is a great and glorious\r\nthing for a nation to be stirred to present triumph by the splendid\r\nmemories of triumphs in the past. But it is a shameful thing for a\r\nnation, if these memories stir it only to empty boastings, to a pride\r\nthat does not shrink from present abasement, to that self-satisfaction\r\nwhich accepts the high resolve and unbending effort of the father as\r\nan excuse for effortless ease or wrongly directed effort in the son.\r\nWe of the present, if we are true to the past, must show by our lives\r\nthat we have learned aright the lessons taught by the men who did the\r\nmighty deeds of the past. We must have in us the spirit which made the\r\nmen of the Civil War what they were; the spirit which produced leaders\r\nsuch as Sherman; the spirit which gave to the average soldier the\r\ngrim tenacity and resourcefulness that made the armies of Grant and\r\nSherman as formidable fighting machines as this world has ever seen.\r\nWe need their ruggedness of body, their keen and vigorous minds, and\r\nabove all their dominant quality of forceful character. Their lives\r\nteach us in our own lives to strive after, not the thing which is\r\nmerely pleasant, but the thing which it is our duty to do. The life of\r\nduty, not the life of mere ease or mere pleasure—that is the kind of\r\nlife which makes the great man as it makes the great nation.\r\n\r\nWe can not afford to lose the virtues which made the men of ’61 to\r\n’65 great in war. No man is warranted in feeling pride in the deeds\r\nof the Army and Navy of the past if he does not back up the Army and\r\nthe Navy of the present. If we are far-sighted in our patriotism,\r\nthere will be no let-up in the work of building, and of keeping at\r\nthe highest point of efficiency, a navy suited to the part the United\r\nStates must hereafter play in the world, and of making and keeping our\r\nsmall Regular Army, which in the event of a great war can never be\r\nanything but the nucleus around which our volunteer armies must form\r\nthemselves, the best army of its size to be found among the nations.\r\n\r\nSo much for our duties in keeping unstained the honor roll our fathers\r\nmade in war. It is of even more instant need that we should show their\r\nspirit of patriotism in the affairs of peace. The duties of peace are\r\nwith us always; those of war are but occasional; and with a nation as\r\nwith a man, the worthiness of life depends upon the way in which the\r\nevery-day duties are done. The home duties are the vital duties. The\r\nnation is nothing but the aggregate of the families within its border;\r\nand if the average man is not hard-working, just, and fearless in his\r\ndealings with those about him, then our average of public life will in\r\nthe end be low; for the stream can rise no higher than its source. But\r\nin addition we need to remember that a peculiar responsibility rests\r\nupon the man in public life. We meet in the capital of the Nation, in\r\nthe city which owes its existence to the fact that it is the seat of\r\nthe National Government. It is well for us in this place, and at this\r\ntime, to remember that exactly as there are certain homely qualities\r\nthe lack of which will prevent the most brilliant man alive from being\r\na useful soldier to his country, so there are certain homely qualities\r\nfor the lack of which in the public servant no shrewdness or ability\r\ncan atone. The greatest leaders, whether in war or in peace, must of\r\ncourse show a peculiar quality of genius; but the most redoubtable\r\narmies that have ever existed have been redoubtable because the\r\naverage soldier, the average officer, possessed to a high degree such\r\ncomparatively simple qualities as loyalty, courage, and hardihood.\r\nAnd so the most successful governments are those in which the average\r\npublic servant possesses that variant of loyalty which we call\r\npatriotism, together with common-sense and honesty. We can as little\r\nafford to tolerate a dishonest man in the public service as a coward\r\nin the army. The murderer takes a single life; the corruptionist in\r\npublic life, whether he be bribe giver or bribe taker, strikes at the\r\nheart of the commonwealth. In every public service, as in every army,\r\nthere will be wrongdoers, there will occur misdeeds. This can not be\r\navoided; but vigilant watch must be kept, and as soon as discovered\r\nthe wrongdoing must be stopped and the wrongdoers punished. Remember\r\nthat in popular government we must rely on the people themselves,\r\nalike for the punishment and the reformation. Those upon whom our\r\ninstitutions cast the initial duty of bringing malefactors to the bar\r\nof justice must be diligent in its discharge; yet in the last resort\r\nthe success of their efforts to purge the public service of corruption\r\nmust depend upon the attitude of the courts and of the juries drawn\r\nfrom the people. Leadership is of avail only so far as there is wise\r\nand resolute public sentiment behind it.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, then, it depends upon us ourselves, upon us the\r\npeople as a whole, whether this Government is or is not to stand in\r\nthe future as it has stood in the past; and my faith that it will\r\nshow no falling off is based upon my faith in the character of our\r\naverage citizenship. The one supreme duty is to try to keep this\r\naverage high. To this end it is well to keep alive the memory of\r\nthose men who are fit to serve as examples of what is loftiest and\r\nbest in American citizenship. Such a man was General Sherman. To very\r\nfew in any generation is it given to render such services as he\r\nrendered; but each of us in his degree can try to show something of\r\nthose qualities of character upon which, in their sum, the high worth\r\nof Sherman rested—his courage, his kindliness, his clean and simple\r\nliving, his sturdy good sense, his manliness and tenderness in the\r\nintimate relations of life, and finally, his inflexible rectitude of\r\nsoul and his loyalty to all that in this free Republic is hallowed and\r\nsymbolized by the national flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE PAN-AMERICAN MISSIONARY SERVICE, CATHEDRAL OF ST. PETER AND\r\nST. PAUL, MOUNT ST. ALBAN, WASHINGTON, D. C., OCTOBER 25, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bishop Satterlee; and to you representatives of the Church both at\r\nhome and abroad; and to all of you, my friends and fellow-citizens_:\r\n\r\nI extend greeting, and in your name I especially welcome those who\r\nare in a sense the guests of the nation to-day. In what I am about to\r\nsay to you, I wish to dwell upon certain thoughts suggested by three\r\ndifferent quotations: In the first place, “Thou shalt serve the Lord\r\nwith all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;” the\r\nnext, “Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves;” and\r\nfinally, in the Collect which you, Bishop Doane, just read, that “we\r\nbeing ready both in body and soul may cheerfully accomplish those\r\nthings which thou commandest.”\r\n\r\nTo an audience such as this I do not have to say anything as to\r\nserving the cause of decency with heart and with soul. I want to\r\ndwell, however, upon the fact that we have the right to claim from you\r\nnot merely that you shall have heart in your work, not merely that you\r\nshall put your souls into it, but that you shall give the best that\r\nyour minds have to it also. In the eternal, the unending warfare for\r\nrighteousness and against evil, the friends of what is good need to\r\nremember that in addition to being decent they must be efficient; that\r\ngood intentions, high purposes, can not be in themselves effective,\r\nthat they are in no sense a substitute for power to make those\r\npurposes, those intentions felt in action. Of course we must first\r\nhave the purpose and the intention. If our powers are not guided\r\naright it is better that we should not have them at all; but we must\r\nhave the power itself before we can guide it aright.\r\n\r\nIn the second text we are told not merely to be harmless as doves, but\r\nalso to be wise as serpents. One of our American humorists who veils\r\nunder jocular phrases much deep wisdom—one of those men has remarked\r\nthat it is much easier to be a harmless dove than a wise serpent. Now,\r\nwe are not to be excused if we do not show both qualities. It is not\r\nvery much praise to give a man to say that he is harmless. We have\r\na right to ask that in addition to the fact that he does no harm to\r\nany one he shall possess the wisdom and the strength to do good to\r\nhis neighbor; that together with innocence, together with purity of\r\nmotive, shall be joined the wisdom and strength to make that purity\r\neffective, that motive translated into substantial result.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the quotation from the Collect, we ask that we may be made\r\nready both in body and in soul, that we may cheerfully accomplish\r\nthose things that we are commanded to do. Ready both in body and in\r\nsoul; that means that we must fit ourselves physically and mentally,\r\nfit ourselves to work with the weapons necessary for dealing with this\r\nlife no less than with the higher, spiritual weapons; fit ourselves\r\nthus to do the work commanded; and moreover, to do it cheerfully.\r\nSmall is our use for the man who individually helps any of us and\r\nshows that he does it grudgingly. We had rather not be helped than\r\nbe helped in such fashion. A favor extended in a manner which shows\r\nthat the man is sorry that he has to grant it is robbed, sometimes of\r\nall, and sometimes of more than all, its benefit. So, in serving the\r\nLord, if we serve him, if we serve the cause of decency, the cause of\r\nrighteousness, in a way that impresses others with the fact that we\r\nare sad in doing it, our service is robbed of an immense proportion\r\nof its efficacy. We have a right to ask a cheerful heart, a right\r\nto ask a buoyant and cheerful spirit among those to whom is granted\r\nthe inestimable privilege of doing the Lord’s work in this world.\r\nThe chance to do work, the duty to do work is not a penalty; it is a\r\nprivilege. Let me quote a sentence that I have quoted once before:\r\n“In this life the man who wins to any goal worth winning almost always\r\ncomes to that goal with a burden bound on his shoulders.” The man who\r\ndoes best in this world, the woman who does best, almost inevitably\r\ndoes it because he or she carries some burden. Life is so constituted\r\nthat the man or the woman who has not some responsibility is thereby\r\ndeprived of the deepest happiness that can come to mankind, because\r\neach and every one of us, if he or she is fit to live in the world\r\nmust be conscious that responsibility always rests on him or on\r\nher—the responsibility of duty toward those dependent upon us; the\r\nresponsibility of duty toward our families, toward our friends, toward\r\nour fellow-citizens; the responsibility of duty to wife and child, to\r\nthe state, to the church. Not only can no man shirk some or all of\r\nthose responsibilities, but no man worth his salt will wish to shirk\r\nthem. On the contrary, he will welcome thrice over the fortune that\r\nputs them upon him.\r\n\r\nIn closing, I want to call your attention to something that is\r\nespecially my business for the time being, and that is measurably your\r\nbusiness all the time, or else you are unfit to be citizens of this\r\nRepublic. In the seventh hymn which we sung, in the last line, you\r\nall joined in singing “God save the State!” Do you intend merely to\r\nsing that, or to try to do it? If you intend merely to sing it, your\r\npart in doing it will be but small. The State will be saved, if the\r\nLord puts it into the heart of the average man so to shape his life\r\nthat the State shall be worth saving, and only on those terms. We need\r\ncivic righteousness. The best constitution that the wit of man has\r\never devised, the best institutions that the ablest statesmen in the\r\nworld have ever reduced to practice by law or by custom, all these\r\nshall be of no avail if they are not vivified by the spirit which\r\nmakes a State great by making its citizens honest, just, and brave. I\r\ndo not ask you as practical believers in applied Christianity to take\r\npart one way or the other in matters that are merely partisan. There\r\nare plenty of questions about which honest men can and do differ very\r\ngreatly and very intensely, but as to which the triumph of either side\r\nmay be compatible with the welfare of the State—a lesser degree of\r\nwelfare or a greater degree of welfare—but compatible with the welfare\r\nof the State. But there are certain great principles, such as those\r\nwhich Cromwell would have called “fundamentals,” concerning which\r\nno man has a right to have more than one opinion. Such a question\r\nis honesty. If you have not honesty in the average private citizen,\r\nin the average public servant, then all else goes for nothing. The\r\nabler a man is, the more dexterous, the shrewder, the bolder, why\r\nthe more dangerous he is if he has not the root of right living and\r\nright thinking in him—and that in private life, and even more in\r\npublic life. Exactly as in time of war, although you need in each\r\nfighting man far more than courage, yet all else counts for nothing\r\nif there is not that courage upon which to base it, so in our civil\r\nlife, although we need that the average man in private life, that\r\nthe average public servant, shall have far more than honesty, yet\r\nall other qualities go for nothing or for worse than nothing unless\r\nhonesty underlies them—honesty in public life and honesty in private\r\nlife; not only the honesty that keeps its skirts technically clear,\r\nbut the honesty that is such according to the spirit as well as\r\nthe letter of the law; the honesty that is aggressive, the honesty\r\nthat not merely deplores corruption—it is easy enough to deplore\r\ncorruption—but that wars against it and tramples it under foot. I\r\nask for that type of honesty, I ask for militant honesty, for the\r\nhonesty of the kind that makes those who have it discontented with\r\nthemselves as long as they have failed to do everything that in them\r\nlies to stamp out dishonesty wherever it can be found, in high place\r\nor in low. And let us not flatter ourselves, we who live in countries\r\nwhere the people rule that it is ultimately possible for the people\r\nto cast upon any but themselves the responsibilities for the shape\r\nthe government and the social and political life of the community\r\nassumes. I ask then that our people feel quickened within them burning\r\nindignation against wrong in every shape, and condemnation of that\r\nwrong, whether found in private or in public life. We have a right to\r\ndemand courage of every man who wears the uniform; it is not so much\r\na credit to him to have it as it is shame unutterable to him if he\r\nlacks it. So when we demand honesty, we demand it not as entitling\r\nthe possessor to praise, but as warranting the heartiest condemnation\r\npossible if he lacks it. Surely in every movement for the betterment\r\nof our life, our life social in the truest and deepest sense, our\r\nlife political, we have a special right to ask not merely support but\r\nleadership from those of the Church. We ask that you here to whom\r\nmuch has been given will remember that from you rightly much will be\r\nexpected in return. For all of us here the lines have been cast in\r\npleasant places. Each of us has been given one talent, or five, or ten\r\ntalents, and each of us is in honor bound to use that talent or those\r\ntalents aright, and to show at the end that he is entitled to the\r\npraise of having done well as a faithful servant.\r\n\r\nI greet you this afternoon, and am glad to see you here, and I trust\r\nand believe that after this service every one of us will go home\r\nfeeling that he or she has been warranted in coming here by the way\r\nin which he or she, after going home, takes up with fresh heart, with\r\nfresh courage, and with fresh and higher purpose the burden of life as\r\nthat burden has been given to him or to her to carry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE CENTENNIAL EXERCISES IN THE N. Y. AVENUE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH,\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., NOV. 16, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Justice_:\r\n\r\nLet me first express the appreciation that all of us feel to Professor\r\nMcMaster for his exceedingly interesting address; and the address\r\nshowed why he can justly claim to be the historian of the people of\r\nthe United States, for what he has told us was what the people did,\r\nnot merely what the outward forms and observances were, but what the\r\nlife of the people was a century ago. And, Mr. Justice, I think that\r\nthe recital has left in the minds of all of us the feeling that while\r\nwe revere our ancestors, we are not wholly discontented that we live\r\nin the present day.\r\n\r\nTo each generation comes its allotted task; and no generation is to\r\nbe excused for failure to perform that task. No generation can claim\r\nas an excuse for such failure the fact that it is not guilty of the\r\nsins of the preceding generation. It was a surprise to me, I suppose\r\nit was a surprise to many of us, to realize that a hundred years\r\nago, in the days of the fathers, the lot of the poor debtor was so\r\nhard. It seems incredible to us now that there should have been such\r\ncallousness to the undeserved human suffering then. I hope sincerely\r\nthat a century hence it will seem equally incredible to the American\r\nof that generation that there should be corruption and venality\r\nin public life. We can divide, and must divide, on party lines as\r\nregards certain questions; as regards the deepest, as regards the\r\nvital questions, we can not afford to divide, and I have the right\r\nto challenge the best effort of every American worthy of the name\r\nto putting down by every means in his power corruption in private\r\nlife, and above all corruption in public life. And, remember, you,\r\nthe people of this government by the people, that while the public\r\nservant, the legislator, the executive officer, the judge, are not\r\nto be excused if they fall short of their duty, yet that their doing\r\ntheir duty can not avail unless you do yours. In the last resort we\r\nhave to depend upon the jury drawn from the people to convict the\r\nscoundrel who has tainted our public life; and unless that jury does\r\nits duty, unless it is backed by the public sentiment of the people,\r\nall the work of legislator, of executive officer, of judicial officer,\r\nare for naught.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice, a man would be a poor citizen of this country if he\r\ncould sit in Abraham Lincoln’s pew and not feel the solemn sense of\r\nthe associations borne in upon him; and I wish to thank the people of\r\nthis church for that reverence for the historic past, for the sense\r\nof historic continuity, which has made them keep this pew unchanged.\r\nI hope it will remain unchanged in this church as long as our country\r\nendures. We have not too many monuments of the past; let us keep every\r\nlittle bit of association with that which is highest and best of the\r\npast as a reminder to us, equally of what we owe to those who have\r\ngone before and of how we should show our appreciation. This evening I\r\nsit in this pew of Abraham Lincoln’s, together with Abraham Lincoln’s\r\nprivate secretary, who, for my good fortune, now serves as Secretary\r\nof State in my Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIf ever there lived a President who during his term of service\r\nneeded all of the consolation and of the strength that he could\r\ndraw from the unseen powers above him, it was Abraham Lincoln, who\r\nworked and suffered for the people, and when he had lived for them\r\nto good end gave his life at the end. If ever there was a man who\r\npractically applied what was taught in our churches, it was Abraham\r\nLincoln. The other day I was rereading—on the suggestion of Mr. Hay—a\r\nlittle speech not often quoted of his, yet which seems to me one of\r\nthe most remarkable that he ever made; delivered right after his\r\nre-election, I think, to a body of serenaders who had come, if my\r\nmemory is correct, from Maryland, and called for an address from him\r\nfrom the White House. It is extraordinary to read that speech, and to\r\nrealize that the man who made it had just come successfully through\r\na great political contest in which he felt that so much was at stake\r\nfor the Nation that he had no time to think whether or not anything\r\nwas at stake for himself. The speech is devoid of the least shade of\r\nbitterness. There is not a word of unseemly triumph over those who\r\nhave been defeated. There is not a word of glorification of himself,\r\nor in any improper sense of his party. There is an earnest appeal,\r\nnow that the election is over, now that the civic strife has been\r\ncompleted, for all decent men who love the country to join together\r\nin service to the country; and in the speech he uses a thoroughly\r\nLincoln-like phrase when he says “I have not willingly planted a\r\nthorn in the breast of any man,” thus trying to make clear that he\r\nhas nothing to say against any opponent, no bitterness toward any\r\nopponent; that all he wishes is that those who opposed him should join\r\nwith those who favored him in working toward a common end. In reading\r\nhis works and addresses, one is struck by the fact that as he went\r\nhigher and higher all personal bitterness seemed to die out of him. In\r\nthe Lincoln-Douglas debates one can still catch now and then a note of\r\npersonal antagonism; the man was in the arena, and as the blows were\r\ngiven and taken you can see that now and then he had a feeling against\r\nhis antagonist. When he became President and faced the crisis that he\r\nhad to face, from that time on I do not think that you can find an\r\nexpression, a speech, a word of Lincoln’s, written or spoken, in which\r\nbitterness is shown to any man. His devotion to the cause was so great\r\nthat he neither could nor would have feeling against any individual.\r\n\r\nIn closing, Mr. Justice, in thanking you of this church, the church so\r\nclosely kindred to my own Dutch Reformed Church, in thanking you for\r\nasking me here, let me say how peculiarly glad I am that in the chair\r\nsits one man, a Justice of the Supreme Court, and that I could be\r\nescorted here by another man, who has just severed his connection with\r\none of the highest places in the United States Army, both of whom—you,\r\nJustice Harlan, you, General Breckinridge—had enjoyed the wonderful\r\nprivilege of proving by their deeds the faith that was in them in the\r\ndays that tried men’s souls; both of whom did their part in holding\r\nup the hands of mighty Lincoln, and both of whom were born in the\r\nState of Lincoln’s birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS TO THE DELEGATES OF THE GERMAN SOCIETIES RECEIVED AT THE\r\nWHITE HOUSE, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Voelckner, and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nIt gives me peculiar pleasure to greet you to-day; and it is a matter\r\nof real regret to me that I can not attend formally your celebration.\r\n\r\nYou are quite right, Mr. Chairman, when you speak of the stand that\r\nthe German element in our citizenship has always taken in all crises\r\nof our national life. In the first place, from the beginning of our\r\ncolonial history to this day, the German strain has been constantly\r\nincreasing in importance among the many strains that go to make up our\r\ncomposite national character. I do not have to repeat to you the story\r\nof the early German immigration to this country—the German immigration\r\nthat began in a mass toward the end of the seventeenth century, but\r\nbefore that time had been represented among the very first settlers.\r\nAllow me to give you one bit of ancestral experience of mine. The\r\nfirst head of the New York City Government who was of German birth was\r\nLeisler, about the year 1680. He was the representative of the popular\r\nfaction in the New York colony of that day, and among the Leislerian\r\naldermen was a forbear of mine named Roosevelt. You are entirely\r\nfamiliar, of course, with the German immigration that went to the\r\nformation of Pennsylvania from the beginning. That element was equally\r\nstrong in the Mohawk Valley in New York; it was equally strong in\r\nMiddle and Western Maryland. For instance, in the Revolutionary War,\r\none of the distinguished figures contributed by New York to the cause\r\nof independence was that of the German Herkimer, whose fight in the\r\nMohawk Valley represented one of the turning points in the struggle\r\nfor independence; and one of the New York counties is now named after\r\nhim. The other day I went out to the battlefield of Antietam, here in\r\nMaryland. There the Memorial Church is the German Lutheran Church,\r\nwhich was founded in 1768, the settlement in the neighborhood of\r\nAntietam being originally exclusively a German settlement. There is a\r\nlist of its pastors, and curiously enough a series of memorial windows\r\nof men with German names—men who belonged to the Maryland regiment\r\nrecruited largely from that region for the Civil War, which Maryland\r\nregiment was mainly composed of men of German extraction. In the\r\nCivil War it would be difficult to paint in too strong colors what I\r\nmay wellnigh call the all-importance of the attitude of the American\r\ncitizens of German birth and extraction toward the cause of Union and\r\nLiberty, especially in what were then known as the border States. It\r\nwould have been out of the question to have kept Missouri loyal had it\r\nnot been for the German element therein. It was the German portion\r\nof the city of St. Louis which formed the core of the Union cause in\r\nMissouri. And but little less important was the part played by the\r\nGermans in Maryland, and also in Louisville and other portions of\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nEach body of immigrants, each element that has thus been added to\r\nour national strain, has contributed something of value to the\r\nnational character; and to no element do we owe more than we owe to\r\nthat element represented by those whom I have the honor this day of\r\naddressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON,\r\n                                               _October 18, 1902_\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MRS. VAN VORST:\r\n\r\nI must write you a line to say how much I have appreciated your\r\narticle, “The Woman who Toils.” But to me there is a most melancholy\r\nside to it, when you touch upon what is fundamentally infinitely\r\nmore important than any other question in this country—that is, the\r\nquestion of race suicide, complete or partial.\r\n\r\nAn easy, good-natured kindliness, and a desire to be “independent,”\r\nthat is, to live one’s life purely according to one’s own desires,\r\nare in no sense substitutes for the fundamental virtues, for the\r\npractice of the strong racial qualities without which there can be\r\nno strong races—the qualities of courage and resolution in both men\r\nand women, of scorn of what is mean, base, and selfish, of eager\r\ndesire to work or fight or suffer as the case may be, provided the\r\nend to be gained is great enough, and the contemptuous putting aside\r\nof mere ease, mere vapid pleasure, mere avoidance of toil and worry.\r\nI do not know whether I most pity or despise the foolish and selfish\r\nman or woman who does not understand that the only things really\r\nworth having in life are those the acquirement of which normally\r\nmeans cost and effort. If a man or woman, through no fault of his or\r\nhers, goes throughout life denied those highest of all joys which\r\nspring only from home life, from the having and bringing up of many\r\nhealthy children, I feel for them deep and respectful sympathy; the\r\nsympathy one extends to the gallant fellow killed at the beginning of\r\na campaign, or the man who toils hard and is brought to ruin by the\r\nfault of others. But the man or woman who deliberately avoids marriage\r\nand has a heart so cold as to know no passion and a brain so shallow\r\nand selfish as to dislike having children, is in effect a criminal\r\nagainst the race and should be an object of contemptuous abhorrence by\r\nall healthy people.\r\n\r\nOf course no one quality makes a good citizen, and no one quality\r\nwill save a nation. But there are certain great qualities for the\r\nlack of which no amount of intellectual brilliancy or of material\r\nprosperity or of easiness of life can atone, and which show decadence\r\nand corruption in the nation, just as much if they are produced by\r\nselfishness and coldness and ease-loving laziness among comparatively\r\npoor people as if they are produced by vicious or frivolous luxury in\r\nthe rich. If the men of the nation are not anxious to work in many\r\ndifferent ways, with all their might and strength, and ready and able\r\nto fight at need, and anxious to be fathers of families, and if the\r\nwomen do not recognize that the greatest thing for any woman is to be\r\na good wife and mother, why, that nation has cause to be alarmed about\r\nits future.\r\n\r\nThere is no physical trouble among us Americans. The trouble with the\r\nsituation you set forth is one of character, and therefore we can\r\nconquer it if we only will.\r\n\r\n                                              Very sincerely yours,\r\n                                                     THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n  MRS. BESSIE VAN VORST,\r\n      Philadelphia, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Personal._\r\n                                               WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON,\r\n                                               _November 26, 1902_\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nI am in receipt of your letter of November 10 and of one from Mr. ——\r\nunder date of November 11, in reference to the appointment of Dr. Crum\r\nas collector of the Port of Charleston.\r\n\r\nIn your letter you make certain specific charges against Dr. Crum,\r\ntending to show his unfitness in several respects for the office\r\nsought. These charges are entitled to the utmost consideration from\r\nme and I shall go over them carefully before taking any action. After\r\nmaking these charges you add, as a further reason for opposition to\r\nhim, that he is a colored man, and after reciting the misdeeds that\r\nfollowed carpet-bag rule and negro domination in South Carolina,\r\nyou say that “we have sworn never again to submit to the rule of\r\nthe African, and such an appointment as that of Dr. Crum to any\r\nsuch office forces us to protest unanimously against this insult to\r\nthe white blood”; and you add that you understood me to say that I\r\nwould never force a negro on such a community as yours. Mr. —— puts\r\nthe objection of color first, saying: “First, he is a colored man,\r\nand that of itself ought to bar him from the office.” In view of\r\nthese last statements, I think I ought to make clear to you why I am\r\nconcerned and pained by your making them and what my attitude is as\r\nregards all such appointments. How any one could have gained the idea\r\nthat I had said I would not appoint reputable and upright colored\r\nmen to office, when objection was made to them solely on account of\r\ntheir color, I confess I am wholly unable to understand. At the time\r\nof my visit to Charleston last spring, I had made, and since that\r\ntime I have made, a number of such appointments from several States\r\nin which there is a considerable colored population. For example, I\r\nmade one such appointment in Mississippi, and another in Alabama,\r\nshortly before my visit to Charleston. I had at that time appointed\r\ntwo colored men as judicial magistrates in the District of Columbia.\r\nI have recently announced another such appointment for New Orleans,\r\nand have just made one from Pennsylvania. The great majority of my\r\nappointments in every State have been of white men. North and South\r\nalike it has been my sedulous endeavor to appoint only men of high\r\ncharacter and good capacity, whether white or black. But it has been\r\nmy consistent policy in every State where their numbers warranted\r\nit to recognize colored men of good repute and standing in making\r\nappointments to office. These appointments of colored men have in\r\nno State made more than a small proportion of the total number of\r\nappointments. I am unable to see how I can legitimately be asked to\r\nmake an exception for South Carolina. In South Carolina, to the four\r\nmost important positions in the State I have appointed three men and\r\ncontinued in office a fourth, all of them white men—three of them\r\noriginally Gold Democrats—two of them, as I am informed, the sons\r\nof Confederate soldiers. I have been informed by the citizens of\r\nCharleston whom I have met that these four men represent a high grade\r\nof public service.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to appoint any unfit man to office. So far as I\r\nlegitimately can I shall always endeavor to pay regard to the wishes\r\nand feelings of the people of each locality; but I can not consent to\r\ntake the position that the door of hope—the door of opportunity—is to\r\nbe shut upon any man, no matter how worthy, purely upon the grounds of\r\nrace or color. Such an attitude would, according to my convictions,\r\nbe fundamentally wrong. If, as you hold, the great bulk of the\r\ncolored people are not yet fit in point of character and influence\r\nto hold such positions, it seems to me that it is worth while putting\r\na premium upon the effort among them to achieve the character and\r\nstanding which will fit them.\r\n\r\nThe question of “negro domination” does not enter into the matter\r\nat all. It might as well be asserted that when I was Governor of\r\nNew York I sought to bring about negro domination in that State\r\nbecause I appointed two colored men of good character and standing to\r\nresponsible positions—one of them to a position paying a salary twice\r\nas large as that paid in the office now under consideration—one of\r\nthem as a director of the Buffalo exposition. The question raised by\r\nyou and Mr. —— in the statements to which I refer, is simply whether\r\nit is to be declared that under no circumstances shall any man of\r\ncolor, no matter how upright and honest, no matter how good a citizen,\r\nno matter how fair in his dealings with his fellows, be permitted\r\nto hold any office under our government. I certainly can not assume\r\nsuch an attitude, and you must permit me to say that in my view it\r\nis an attitude no man should assume, whether he looks at it from the\r\nstandpoint of the true interest of the white men of the South or of\r\nthe colored men of the South—not to speak of any other section of the\r\nUnion. It seems to me that it is a good thing from every standpoint\r\nto let the colored man know that if he shows in marked degree the\r\nqualities of good citizenship—the qualities which in a white man we\r\nfeel are entitled to reward—then he will not be cut off from all hope\r\nof similar reward.\r\n\r\nWithout any regard to what my decision may be on the merits of this\r\nparticular applicant for this particular place, I feel that I ought to\r\nlet you know clearly my attitude on the far broader question raised\r\nby you and Mr. ——; an attitude from which I have not varied during my\r\nterm of office.\r\n\r\n                                            Faithfully yours,\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n  HON. ——\r\n\r\n  Charleston, S. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON,\r\n                                               _February 24, 1903_\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. HOWELL:\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a high opinion of the gentleman you mention and if the\r\nopportunity occurs I shall be glad to do anything I can for him.\r\n\r\nNow as to what you say concerning Federal appointments in the South.\r\nFrankly, it seems to me that my appointments speak for themselves and\r\nthat my policy is self-explanatory. So far from feeling that they need\r\nthe slightest apology or justification, my position is that on the\r\nstrength of what I have done I have the right to claim the support of\r\nall good citizens who wish not only a high standard of Federal service\r\nbut fair and equitable dealing to the South as well as to the North,\r\nand a policy of consistent justice and good-will toward all men. In\r\nmaking appointments I have sought to consider the feelings of the\r\npeople of each locality so far as I could consistently do so without\r\nsacrificing principle. The prime tests I have applied have been those\r\nof character, fitness and ability, and when I have been dissatisfied\r\nwith what has been offered within my own party lines I have without\r\nhesitation gone to the opposite party—and you are of course aware that\r\nI have repeatedly done this in your own State of Georgia. I certainly\r\ncan not treat mere color as a permanent bar to holding office, any\r\nmore than I could so treat creed or birthplace—always provided that in\r\nother respects the applicant or incumbent is a worthy and well-behaved\r\nAmerican citizen. Just as little will I treat it as conferring a right\r\nto hold office. I have scant sympathy with the mere doctrinaire, with\r\nthe man of mere theory who refuses to face facts; but do you not think\r\nthat in the long run it is safer for everybody if we act on the motto\r\n“All men up,” rather than that of “Some men down”?\r\n\r\nI ask you to judge not by what I say but by what during the last\r\nseventeen months I have actually done. In your own State of Georgia\r\nyou are competent to judge from your own experience. In the great\r\nbulk of the cases I have reappointed President McKinley’s appointees.\r\nThe changes I have made, such as that in the postmastership at Athens\r\nand in the surveyorship at Atlanta, were, as I think you will agree,\r\nchanges for the better and not for the worse. It happens that in each\r\nof these offices I have appointed a white man to succeed a colored\r\nman. In South Carolina I have similarly appointed a white postmaster\r\nto succeed a colored postmaster. Again, in South Carolina I have\r\nnominated a colored man to fill a vacancy in the position of collector\r\nof the port of Charleston, just as in Georgia I have reappointed the\r\ncolored man who is now serving as collector of the port of Savannah.\r\nBoth are fit men. Why the appointment of one should cause any more\r\nexcitement than the appointment of the other, I am wholly at a loss\r\nto imagine. As I am writing to a man of keen and trained intelligence\r\nI need hardly say that to connect either of these appointments, or\r\nany or all of my other appointments, or my actions in upholding\r\nthe law at Indianola, with such questions as “social equality” and\r\n“negro domination” is as absurd as to connect them with the nebular\r\nhypothesis or the theory of atoms.\r\n\r\nI have consulted freely with your own Senators and Congressmen as to\r\nthe character and capacity of any appointee in Georgia concerning\r\nwhom there was question. My party advisers in the State have been\r\nMajor Hanson of Macon, Mr. Walter Johnson of Atlanta—both of them\r\nex-Confederate soldiers—and Mr. Harry Stillwell Edwards, also of\r\nMacon. I believe you will agree with me that in no State would it be\r\npossible to find gentlemen abler and more upright or better qualified\r\nto fill the positions they have filled with reference to me. In every\r\ninstance where these gentlemen have united in making a recommendation\r\nI have been able to follow their advice. Am I not right in saying\r\nthat the Federal office-holders whom I have appointed throughout your\r\nState are, as a body, men and women of a high order of efficiency and\r\nintegrity? If you know of any Federal office-holder in Georgia of whom\r\nthis is not true pray let me know at once. I will welcome testimony\r\nfrom you or from any other reputable citizen which will tend to show\r\nthat a given public officer is unworthy; and, most emphatically,\r\nshort will be the shrift of any one whose lack of worth is proven.\r\nIncidentally I may mention that a large percentage of the incumbents\r\nof Federal offices in Georgia under me are, as I understand it, of\r\nyour own political faith. But they are supported by me in every way\r\nas long as they continue to render good and faithful service to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThis is true of your own State; and by applying to Mr. Thomas Nelson\r\nPage of Virginia, to General Basil Duke of Kentucky, to Mr. George\r\nCrawford of Tennessee, to Mr. John McIlhenny of Louisiana, to Judge\r\nJones of Alabama, and Mr. Edgar L. Wilson of Mississippi, all of\r\nthem Democrats and all of them men of the highest standing in their\r\nrespective communities, you will find that what I have done in Georgia\r\nstands not as the exception but as the rule for what I have done\r\nthroughout the South. I have good reason to believe that my appointees\r\nin the different States mentioned—and as the sum of the parts is the\r\nwhole, necessarily in the South at large—represent not merely an\r\nimprovement upon those whose places they took, but upon the whole a\r\nhigher standard of Federal service than has hitherto been attained in\r\nthe communities in question. I may add that the proportion of colored\r\nmen among these new appointees is only about one in a hundred.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these facts I have been surprised, and somewhat pained,\r\nat what seems to me the incomprehensible outcry in the South about my\r\nactions—an outcry apparently started in New York for reasons wholly\r\nunconnected with the question nominally at issue. I am concerned at\r\nthe attitude thus taken by so many of the Southern people; but I\r\nam not in the least angry; and still less will this attitude have\r\nthe effect of making me swerve one hair’s breadth, to one side or\r\nthe other, from the course I have marked out—the course I have\r\nconsistently followed in the past and shall consistently follow in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n                                               With regard,\r\n                                                 Sincerely yours,\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n  Hon.

Miller was removed by the Public Printer\r\nfrom his position of Assistant Foreman at the Government Printing\r\nOffice. Mr. Miller filed a complaint with the Civil Service\r\nCommission alleging that his removal had been made in violation of the\r\ncivil service law and rules. After an investigation of the complaint,\r\nand upon July 6th, the Civil Service Commission advised the Public\r\nPrinter of its decision as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Section 2 of Civil Service Rule XII, governing removals, provides\r\n  that no person shall be removed from a competitive position except\r\n  for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the public service.\r\n  The Commission does not consider expulsion from a labor union, being\r\n  the action of a body is no way connected with the public service nor\r\n  having authority over public employees, to be such a cause as will\r\n  promote the efficiency of the public service.\r\n\r\n  “As the only reason given by you for your removal of Mr. Miller\r\n  is that he was expelled from Local Union No. 4, International\r\n  Brotherhood of Bookbinders, you are advised that the Commission can\r\n  not recognize his removal and must request that he be reassigned to\r\n  duty in his position.”\r\n\r\nMr. Miller’s complaint had also been filed with the President,\r\nunder whose direction it was being investigated by the Secretary of\r\nCommerce and Labor simultaneously with the investigation by the Civil\r\nService Commission. As a result of such investigations, the following\r\nletters, under dates of July 13th and 14th, 1903, were written by the\r\nPresident:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      OYSTER BAY, N.

Meanwhile I will withhold my final decision of the whole\r\ncase until I have received the report of the investigation on Miller’s\r\nsecond communication, which you notify me has been begun to-day, July\r\n13th.\r\n\r\nOn the face of the papers presented, Miller would appear to have been\r\nremoved in violation of law. There is no objection to the employees of\r\nthe Government Printing Office constituting themselves into a union\r\nif they so desire; but no rules or resolutions of that union can be\r\npermitted to over-ride the laws of the United States, which it is my\r\nsworn duty to enforce.\r\n\r\nPlease communicate a copy of this letter to the Public Printer for his\r\ninformation and that of his subordinates.\r\n\r\n                                              Very truly yours,\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n  HON.

This\r\ncommission was dealing with labor organizations working for private\r\nemployers. It is of course mere elementary decency to require that all\r\nthe Government departments shall be handled in accordance with the\r\nprinciple thus clearly and fearlessly enunciated.\r\n\r\nPlease furnish a copy of this letter both to Mr. Palmer and to the\r\nCivil Service Commission for their guidance.\r\n\r\n                                              Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n  HON. GEO. B. CORTELYOU,\r\n      Secretary of Commerce and Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _September 29, 1903_\r\n\r\nPursuant to the request of Samuel Gompers, President of the American\r\nFederation of Labor, the President granted an interview this evening\r\nto the following members of the executive council of that body:\r\nMr. Samuel Gompers, Mr. James Duncan, Mr. John Mitchell, Mr. James\r\nO’Connell and Mr. Frank Morrison, at which various subjects of\r\nlegislation in the interest of labor, as well as executive action,\r\nwere discussed. Concerning the case of William A. Miller the President\r\nmade the following statement:\r\n\r\nI thank you and your committee for your courtesy, and I appreciate the\r\nopportunity to meet with you. It will always be a pleasure to see you\r\nor any representatives of your organizations or of your Federation as\r\na whole.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Miller case, I have little to add to what I have\r\nalready said. In dealing with it I ask you to remember that I am\r\ndealing purely with the relation of the Government to its employees.\r\nI must govern my action by the laws of the land, which I am sworn to\r\nadminister, and which differentiate any case in which the Government\r\nof the United States is a party from all other cases whatsoever. These\r\nlaws are enacted for the benefit of the whole people, and can not and\r\nmust not be construed as permitting discrimination against some of\r\nthe people. I am President of all the people of the United States,\r\nwithout regard to creed, color, birthplace, occupation, or social\r\ncondition. My aim is to do equal and exact justice as among them all.\r\nIn the employment and dismissal of men in the Government service I can\r\nno more recognize the fact that a man does or does not belong to a\r\nunion as being for or against him than I can recognize the fact that\r\nhe is a Protestant or a Catholic, a Jew or a Gentile, as being for or\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nIn the communications sent me by various labor organizations\r\nprotesting against the retention of Miller in the Government Printing\r\nOffice, the grounds alleged are twofold: 1, that he is a non-union\r\nman; 2, that he is not personally fit. The question of his personal\r\nfitness is one to be settled in the routine of administrative detail,\r\nand can not be allowed to conflict with or to complicate the larger\r\nquestion of governmental discrimination for or against him or any\r\nother man because he is or is not a member of a union. This is the\r\nonly question now before me for decision; and as to this my decision\r\nis final.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      OYSTER BAY, N.

I feel, my dear sir, that you have made all\r\nmen your debtors who believe, as all far-seeing men must, that the\r\nwell-being, indeed the very existence, of the Republic depends upon\r\nthat spirit of orderly liberty under the law which is as incompatible\r\nwith mob violence as with any form of despotism. Of course mob\r\nviolence is simply one form of anarchy; and anarchy is now, as it\r\nalways has been, the handmaiden and forerunner of tyranny.\r\n\r\nI feel that you have not only reflected honor upon the State which\r\nfor its good fortune has you as its Chief Executive, but upon the\r\nwhole nation. It is incumbent upon every man throughout this country\r\nnot only to hold up your hands in the course you have been following,\r\nbut to show his realization that the matter is one which is of vital\r\nconcern to us all.\r\n\r\nAll thoughtful men must feel the gravest alarm over the growth of\r\nlynching in this country, and especially over the peculiarly hideous\r\nforms so often taken by mob violence when colored men are the\r\nvictims—on which occasions the mob seems to lay most weight, not on\r\nthe crime, but on the color of the criminal. In a certain proportion\r\nof these cases the man lynched has been guilty of a crime horrible\r\nbeyond description; a crime so horrible that as far as he himself\r\nis concerned he has forfeited the right to any kind of sympathy\r\nwhatsoever. The feeling of all good citizens that such a hideous\r\ncrime shall not be hideously punished by mob violence is due not in\r\nthe least to sympathy for the criminal, but to a very lively sense of\r\nthe train of dreadful consequences which follows the course taken by\r\nthe mob in exacting inhuman vengeance for an inhuman wrong. In such\r\ncases, moreover, it is well to remember that the criminal not merely\r\nsins against humanity in inexpiable and unpardonable fashion, but sins\r\nparticularly against his own race, and does them a wrong far greater\r\nthan any white man can possibly do them. Therefore, in such cases\r\nthe colored people throughout the land should in every possible way\r\nshow their belief that they, more than all others in the community,\r\nare horrified at the commission of such a crime and are peculiarly\r\nconcerned in taking every possible measure to prevent its recurrence\r\nand to bring the criminal to immediate justice. The slightest lack of\r\nvigor either in denunciation of the crime or in bringing the criminal\r\nto justice is itself unpardonable.\r\n\r\nMoreover, every effort should be made under the law to expedite the\r\nproceedings of justice in the case of such an awful crime. But it can\r\nnot be necessary in order to accomplish this to deprive any citizen of\r\nthose fundamental rights to be heard in his own defence which are so\r\ndear to us all and which lie at the root of our liberty. It certainly\r\nought to be possible by the proper administration of the laws to\r\nsecure swift vengeance upon the criminal; and the best and immediate\r\nefforts of all legislators, judges, and citizens should be addressed\r\nto securing such reforms in our legal procedure as to leave no vestige\r\nof excuse for those misguided men who undertake to reap vengeance\r\nthrough violent methods.\r\n\r\nMen who have been guilty of a crime like rape or murder should be\r\nvisited with swift and certain punishment, and the just effort\r\nmade by the courts to protect them in their rights should under no\r\ncircumstances be perverted into permitting any mere technicality\r\nto avert or delay their punishment. The substantial rights of the\r\nprisoner to a fair trial must of course be guaranteed, as you have so\r\njustly insisted that they should be; but, subject to this guarantee,\r\nthe law must work swiftly and surely, and all the agents of the law\r\nshould realize the wrong they do when they permit justice to be\r\ndelayed or thwarted for technical or insufficient reasons. We must\r\nshow that the law is adequate to deal with crime by freeing it from\r\nevery vestige of technicality and delay.\r\n\r\nBut the fullest recognition of the horror of the crime and the most\r\ncomplete lack of sympathy with the criminal can not in the least\r\ndiminish our horror at the way in which it has become customary\r\nto avenge these crimes and at the consequences that are already\r\nproceeding therefrom. It is of course inevitable that where vengeance\r\nis taken by a mob it should frequently light on innocent people; and\r\nthe wrong done in such a case to the individual is one for which\r\nthere is no remedy. But even where the real criminal is reached,\r\nthe wrong done by the mob to the community itself is wellnigh as\r\ngreat. Especially is this true where the lynching is accompanied with\r\ntorture. There are certain hideous sights which when once seen can\r\nnever be wholly erased from the mental retina. The mere fact of having\r\nseen them implies degradation. This is a thousandfold stronger when\r\ninstead of merely seeing the deed the man has participated in it.\r\nWhoever in any part of our country has ever taken part in lawlessly\r\nputting to death a criminal by the dreadful torture of fire must\r\nforever after have the awful spectacle of his own handiwork seared\r\ninto his brain and soul. He can never again be the same man.\r\n\r\nThis matter of lynching would be a terrible thing even if it stopped\r\nwith the lynching of men guilty of the inhuman and hideous crime\r\nof rape; but as a matter of fact, lawlessness of this type never\r\ndoes stop and never can stop in such fashion. Every violent man in\r\nthe community is encouraged by every case of lynching in which the\r\nlynchers go unpunished to himself take the law into his own hands\r\nwhenever it suits his own convenience. In the same way the use of\r\ntorture by the mob in certain cases is sure to spread until it is\r\napplied more or less indiscriminately in other cases. The spirit of\r\nlawlessness grows with what it feeds on, and when mobs with impunity\r\nlynch criminals for one cause, they are certain to begin to lynch\r\nreal or alleged criminals for other causes. In the recent cases\r\nof lynching, over three-fourths were not for rape at all, but for\r\nmurder, attempted murder, and even less heinous offences. Moreover,\r\nthe history of these recent cases shows the awful fact that when the\r\nminds of men are habituated to the use of torture by lawless bodies\r\nto avenge crimes of a peculiarly revolting description, other lawless\r\nbodies will use torture in order to punish crimes of an ordinary\r\ntype. Surely no patriot can fail to see the fearful brutalization and\r\ndebasement which the indulgence of such a spirit and such practices\r\ninevitably portends. Surely all public men, all writers for the daily\r\npress, all clergymen, all teachers, all who in any way have a right\r\nto address the public, should with every energy unite to denounce such\r\ncrimes and to support those engaged in putting them down. As a people\r\nwe claim the right to speak with peculiar emphasis for freedom and\r\nfor fair treatment of all men without regard to differences of race,\r\nfortune, creed, or color. We forfeit the right so to speak when we\r\ncommit or condone such crimes as these of which I speak.\r\n\r\nThe nation, like the individual, can not commit a crime with impunity.\r\nIf we are guilty of lawlessness and brutal violence, whether our\r\nguilt consists in active participation therein or in mere connivance\r\nand encouragement, we shall assuredly suffer later on because of\r\nwhat we have done. The cornerstone of this Republic, as of all free\r\ngovernment, is respect for and obedience to the law. Where we permit\r\nthe law to be defied or evaded, whether by rich man or poor man, by\r\nblack man or white, we are by just so much weakening the bonds of our\r\ncivilization and increasing the chances of its overthrow, and of the\r\nsubstitution therefor of a system in which there shall be violent\r\nalternations of anarchy and tyranny.\r\n\r\n                                              Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n  HON. WINFIELD T. DURBIN,\r\n      Governor of Indiana,\r\n         Indianapolis, Ind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, COMMUNICATED TO THE\r\nTWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS, AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST SESSION OF THE\r\nFIFTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MESSAGE\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Congress assembles this year under the shadow of a great calamity.\r\nOn the sixth of September, President McKinley was shot by an anarchist\r\nwhile attending the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, and died in\r\nthat city on the fourteenth of that month.\r\n\r\nOf the last seven elected Presidents, he is the third who has\r\nbeen murdered, and the bare recital of this fact is sufficient to\r\njustify grave alarm among all loyal American citizens. Moreover,\r\nthe circumstances of this, the third assassination of an American\r\nPresident, have a peculiarity sinister significance. Both President\r\nLincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types\r\nunfortunately not uncommon in history; President Lincoln falling a\r\nvictim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war,\r\nand President Garfield to the revengeful vanity of a disappointed\r\noffice-seeker. President McKinley was killed by an utterly depraved\r\ncriminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to all\r\ngovernments, good and bad alike, who are against any form of popular\r\nliberty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws,\r\nand who are as hostile to the upright exponent of a free people’s\r\nsober will as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley’s\r\ndeath he was the most widely loved man in all the United States;\r\nwhile we have never had any public man of his position who has been\r\nso wholly free from the bitter animosities incident to public life.\r\nHis political opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most\r\ngenerous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the sweetness and\r\ngentleness of character which so endeared him to his close associates.\r\nTo a standard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tender\r\naffections and home virtues which are all-important in the make-up\r\nof national character. A gallant soldier in the great war for the\r\nUnion, he also shone as an example to all our people because of his\r\nconduct in the most sacred and intimate of home relations. There\r\ncould be no personal hatred of him, for he never acted with aught but\r\nconsideration for the welfare of others. No one could fail to respect\r\nhim who knew him in public or private life. The defenders of those\r\nmurderous criminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting\r\nthat it is exercised for political ends, inveigh against wealth and\r\nirresponsible power. But for this assassination even this base apology\r\ncan not be urged.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose stock\r\nsprang from the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself belonged\r\namong the wage-workers, who had entered the Army as a private soldier.\r\nWealth was not struck at when the President was assassinated, but the\r\nhonest toil which is content with moderate gains after a lifetime\r\nof unremitting labor, largely in the service of the public. Still\r\nless was power struck at in the sense that power is irresponsible or\r\ncentred in the hands of any one individual. The blow was not aimed at\r\ntyranny or wealth. It was aimed at one of the strongest champions the\r\nwage-worker has ever had; at one of the most faithful representatives\r\nof the system of public rights and representative government who has\r\never risen to public office. President McKinley filled that political\r\noffice for which the entire people vote, and no President—not even\r\nLincoln himself—was ever more earnestly anxious to represent the well\r\nthought out wishes of the people; his one anxiety in every crisis was\r\nto keep in closest touch with the people—to find out what they thought\r\nand to endeavor to give expression to their thought, after having\r\nendeavored to guide that thought aright. He had just been re-elected\r\nto the Presidency because the majority of our citizens, the majority\r\nof our farmers and wage-workers, believed that he had faithfully\r\nupheld their interests for four years. They felt themselves in close\r\nand intimate touch with him. They felt that he represented so well and\r\nso honorably all their ideals and aspirations that they wished him to\r\ncontinue for another four years to represent them.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the man at whom the assassin struck! That there might be\r\nnothing lacking to complete the Judas-like infamy of his act, he took\r\nadvantage of an occasion when the President was meeting the people\r\ngenerally; and advancing as if to take the hand outstretched to him\r\nin kindly and brotherly fellowship, he turned the noble and generous\r\nconfidence of the victim into an opportunity to strike the fatal blow.\r\nThere is no baser deed in all the annals of crime.\r\n\r\nThe shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of all\r\nwho saw the dark days while the President yet hovered between life\r\nand death. At last the light was stilled in the kindly eyes and the\r\nbreath went from the lips that even in mortal agony uttered no words\r\nsave of forgiveness to his murderer, of love for his friends, and\r\nof unfaltering trust in the will of the Most High. Such a death,\r\ncrowning the glory of such a life, leaves us with infinite sorrow, but\r\nwith such pride in what he had accomplished and in his own personal\r\ncharacter, that we feel the blow not as struck at him, but as struck\r\nat the nation. We mourn a good and great President who is dead; but\r\nwhile we mourn we are lifted up by the splendid achievements of his\r\nlife and the grand heroism with which he met his death.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from the man to the nation, the harm done is so great as\r\nto excite our gravest apprehensions and to demand our wisest and most\r\nresolute action. This criminal was a professed anarchist, inflamed\r\nby the teachings of professed anarchists, and probably also by the\r\nreckless utterances of those who, on the stump and in the public\r\npress, appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy\r\nand sullen hatred. The wind is sowed by the men who preach such\r\ndoctrines, and they can not escape their share of responsibility for\r\nthe whirlwind that is reaped. This applies alike to the deliberate\r\ndemagogue, to the exploiter of sensationalism, and to the crude and\r\nfoolish visionary who, for whatever reason, apologizes for crime or\r\nexcites aimless discontent.\r\n\r\nThe blow was aimed not at this President, but at all Presidents; at\r\nevery symbol of government. President McKinley was as emphatically the\r\nembodiment of the popular will of the nation expressed through the\r\nforms of law as a New England town meeting is in similar fashion the\r\nembodiment of the law-abiding purpose and practice of the people of\r\nthe town. On no conceivable theory could the murder of the President\r\nbe accepted as due to protest against “inequalities in the social\r\norder,” save as the murder of all the freemen engaged in a town\r\nmeeting could be accepted as a protest against that social inequality\r\nwhich puts a malefactor in jail. Anarchy is no more an expression of\r\n“social discontent” than picking pockets or wife-beating.\r\n\r\nThe anarchist, and especially the anarchist in the United States, is\r\nmerely one type of criminal, more dangerous than any other because\r\nhe represents the same depravity in a greater degree. The man who\r\nadvocates anarchy directly or indirectly, in any shape or fashion,\r\nor the man who apologizes for anarchists and their deeds, makes\r\nhimself morally accessory to murder before the fact. The anarchist\r\nis a criminal whose perverted instincts lead him to prefer confusion\r\nand chaos to the most beneficent form of social order. His protest of\r\nconcern for workingmen is outrageous in its impudent falsity; for if\r\nthe political institutions of this country do not afford opportunity\r\nto every honest and intelligent son of toil, then the door of hope is\r\nforever closed against him. The anarchist is everywhere not merely\r\nthe enemy of system and of progress, but the deadly foe of liberty.\r\nIf ever anarchy is triumphant, its triumph will last for but one red\r\nmoment, to be succeeded for ages by the gloomy night of despotism.\r\n\r\nFor the anarchist himself, whether he preaches or practices his\r\ndoctrines, we need not have one particle more concern than for any\r\nordinary murderer. He is not the victim of social or political\r\ninjustice. There are no wrongs to remedy in his case. The cause of his\r\ncriminality is to be found in his own evil passions and in the evil\r\nconduct of those who urge him on, not in any failure by others or by\r\nthe State to do justice to him or his. He is a malefactor and nothing\r\nelse. He is in no sense, in no shape or way, a “product of social\r\nconditions,” save as a highwayman is “produced” by the fact that an\r\nunarmed man happens to have a purse. It is a travesty upon the great\r\nand holy names of liberty and freedom to permit them to be invoked in\r\nsuch a cause. No man or body of men preaching anarchistic doctrines\r\nshould be allowed at large any more than if preaching the murder of\r\nsome specified private individual. Anarchistic speeches, writings, and\r\nmeetings are essentially seditious and treasonable.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend to the Congress that in the exercise of its\r\nwise discretion it should take into consideration the coming to this\r\ncountry of anarchists or persons professing principles hostile to all\r\ngovernment and justifying the murder of those placed in authority.\r\nSuch individuals as those who not long ago gathered in open meeting to\r\nglorify the murder of King Humbert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and\r\nthe law should ensure their rigorous punishment. They and those like\r\nthem should be kept out of this country; and if found here they should\r\nbe promptly deported to the country whence they came; and far-reaching\r\nprovisions should be made for the punishment of those who stay. No\r\nmatter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills\r\nor attempts to kill the President or any man who by the Constitution\r\nor by law is in line of succession for the Presidency, while the\r\npunishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the\r\nenormity of the offence against our institutions.\r\n\r\nAnarchy is a crime against the whole human race; and all mankind\r\nshould band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offence\r\nagainst the law of nations, like piracy and that form of man-stealing\r\nknown as the slave trade; for it is of far blacker infamy than either.\r\nIt should be so declared by treaties among all civilized powers. Such\r\ntreaties would give to the Federal Government the power of dealing\r\nwith the crime.\r\n\r\nA grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist position was\r\nafforded by the attitude of the law toward this very criminal who had\r\njust taken the life of the President. The people would have torn him\r\nlimb from limb if it had not been that the law he defied was at once\r\ninvoked in his behalf. So far from his deed being committed on behalf\r\nof the people against the government, the government was obliged at\r\nonce to exert its full police power to save him from instant death at\r\nthe hands of the people. Moreover, his deed worked not the slightest\r\ndislocation in our governmental system, and the danger of a recurrence\r\nof such deeds, no matter how great it might grow, would work only in\r\nthe direction of strengthening and giving harshness to the forces of\r\norder. No man will ever be restrained from becoming President by any\r\nfear as to his personal safety. If the risk to the President’s life\r\nbecame great, it would mean that the office would more and more come\r\nto be filled by men of a spirit which would make them resolute and\r\nmerciless in dealing with every friend of disorder. This great country\r\nwill not fall into anarchy, and if anarchists should ever become a\r\nserious menace to its institutions, they would not merely be stamped\r\nout, but would involve in their own ruin every active or passive\r\nsympathizer with their doctrines. The American people are slow to\r\nwrath, but when their wrath is once kindled it burns like a consuming\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nDuring the last five years business confidence has been restored and\r\nthe nation is to be congratulated because of its present abounding\r\nprosperity. Such prosperity can never be created by law alone,\r\nalthough it is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws. If\r\nthe hand of the Lord is heavy upon any country, if flood or drought\r\ncomes, human wisdom is powerless to avert the calamity. Moreover, no\r\nlaw can guard us against the consequences of our own folly. The men\r\nwho are idle or credulous, the men who seek gains not by genuine work\r\nwith head or hand but by gambling in any form, are always a source\r\nof menace not only to themselves but to others. If the business\r\nworld loses its head, it loses what legislation can not supply.\r\nFundamentally the welfare of each citizen, and therefore the welfare\r\nof the aggregate of citizens which makes the nation, must rest upon\r\nindividual thrift and energy, resolution and intelligence. Nothing can\r\ntake the place of this individual capacity; but wise legislation and\r\nhonest and intelligent administration can give it the fullest scope,\r\nthe largest opportunity to work to good effect.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went\r\non with ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century brings us face to face, at the beginning of the\r\ntwentieth, with very serious social problems. The old laws, and the\r\nold customs which had almost the binding force of law, were once quite\r\nsufficient to regulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth.\r\nSince the industrial changes which have so enormously increased the\r\nproductive power of mankind, they are no longer sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe growth of cities has gone on beyond comparison faster than the\r\ngrowth of the country, and the upbuilding of the great industrial\r\ncentres has meant a startling increase, not merely in the aggregate of\r\nwealth, but in the number of very large individual, and especially of\r\nvery large corporate, fortunes. The creation of these great corporate\r\nfortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental\r\naction, but to natural causes in the business world, operating in\r\nother countries as they operate in our own.\r\n\r\nThe process has aroused much antagonism, a great part of which is\r\nwholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown\r\nricher the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never before\r\nhas the average man, the wage-worker, the farmer, the small trader,\r\nbeen so well off as in this country and at the present time. There\r\nhave been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth; yet it\r\nremains true that a fortune accumulated in legitimate business can\r\nbe accumulated by the person specially benefited only on condition\r\nof conferring immense incidental benefits upon others. Successful\r\nenterprise, of the type which benefits all mankind, can only exist\r\nif the conditions are such as to offer great prizes as the rewards of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe captains of industry who have driven the railway systems across\r\nthis continent, who have built up our commerce, who have developed our\r\nmanufactures, have on the whole done great good to our people. Without\r\nthem the material development of which we are so justly proud could\r\nnever have taken place. Moreover, we should recognize the immense\r\nimportance to this material development of leaving as unhampered as is\r\ncompatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon whom\r\nthe success of business operations inevitably rests. The slightest\r\nstudy of business conditions will satisfy any one capable of forming a\r\njudgment that the personal equation is the most important factor in a\r\nbusiness operation; that the business ability of the man at the head\r\nof any business concern, big or little, is usually the factor which\r\nfixes the gulf between striking success and hopeless failure.\r\n\r\nAn additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations is to\r\nbe found in the international commercial conditions of to-day. The\r\nsame business conditions which have produced the great aggregations\r\nof corporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors\r\nin international commercial competition. Business concerns which have\r\nthe largest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men\r\nare naturally those which take the lead in the strife for commercial\r\nsupremacy among the nations of the world. America has only just begun\r\nto assume that commanding position in the international business world\r\nwhich we believe will more and more be hers. It is of the utmost\r\nimportance that this position be not jeoparded, especially at a time\r\nwhen the overflowing abundance of our own natural resources and the\r\nskill, business energy, and mechanical aptitude of our people make\r\nforeign markets essential. Under such conditions it would be most\r\nunwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our nation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it can not too often be pointed out that to strike with\r\nignorant violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitably\r\nendangers the interests of all. The fundamental rule in our national\r\nlife—the rule which underlies all others—is that, on the whole, and in\r\nthe long run, we shall go up or down together. There are exceptions;\r\nand in times of prosperity some will prosper far more, and in times\r\nof adversity some will suffer far more, than others; but speaking\r\ngenerally, a period of good times means that all share more or less in\r\nthem, and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater\r\nor less degree. It surely ought not to be necessary to enter into any\r\nproof of this statement; the memory of the lean years which began in\r\n1893 is still vivid, and we can contrast them with the conditions\r\nin this very year which is now closing. Disaster to great business\r\nenterprises can never have its effects limited to the men at the top.\r\nIt spreads throughout, and while it is bad for everybody, it is worst\r\nfor those furthest down. The capitalist may be shorn of his luxuries;\r\nbut the wage-worker may be deprived of even bare necessities.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care\r\nmust be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or\r\nignorance. Many of those who have made it their vocation to denounce\r\nthe great industrial combinations which are popularly, although with\r\ntechnical inaccuracy, known as “trusts,” appeal especially to hatred\r\nand fear. These are precisely the two emotions, particularly when\r\ncombined with ignorance, which unfit men for the exercise of cool\r\nand steady judgment. In facing new industrial conditions, the whole\r\nhistory of the world shows that legislation will generally be both\r\nunwise and ineffective unless undertaken after calm inquiry and with\r\nsober self-restraint. Much of the legislation directed at the trusts\r\nwould have been exceedingly mischievous had it not also been entirely\r\nineffective. In accordance with a well-known sociological law, the\r\nignorant or reckless agitator has been the really effective friend\r\nof the evils which he has been nominally opposing. In dealing with\r\nbusiness interests, for the government to undertake by crude and\r\nill-considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad, would\r\nbe to incur the risk of such far-reaching national disaster that it\r\nwould be preferable to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand\r\nthe impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces\r\nwith which they are nominally at war, for they hamper those who would\r\nendeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are\r\nand to what extent and in what manner it is practicable to apply\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nAll this is true; and yet it is also true that there are real and\r\ngrave evils, one of the chief being overcapitalization because of its\r\nmany baleful consequences; and a resolute and practical effort must be\r\nmade to correct these evils.\r\n\r\nThere is widespread conviction in the minds of the American people\r\nthat the great corporations known as trusts are in certain of their\r\nfeatures and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare. This springs\r\nfrom no spirit of envy or uncharitableness, nor lack of pride in the\r\ngreat industrial achievements that have placed this country at the\r\nhead of the nations struggling for commercial supremacy. It does not\r\nrest upon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the necessity of\r\nmeeting changing and changed conditions of trade with new methods, nor\r\nupon ignorance of the fact that combination of capital in the effort\r\nto accomplish great things is necessary when the world’s progress\r\ndemands that great things be done. It is based upon sincere conviction\r\nthat combination and concentration should be, not prohibited, but\r\nsupervised and within reasonable limits controlled; and in my judgment\r\nthis conviction is right.\r\n\r\nIt is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to\r\nrequire that when men receive from government the privilege of doing\r\nbusiness under corporate form, which frees them from individual\r\nresponsibility, and enables them to call into their enterprises the\r\ncapital of the public, they shall do so upon absolutely truthful\r\nrepresentations as to the value of the property in which the capital\r\nis to be invested. Corporations engaged in interstate commerce should\r\nbe regulated if they are found to exercise a license working to the\r\npublic injury. It should be as much the aim of those who seek for\r\nsocial betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning\r\nas to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence. Great\r\ncorporations exist only because they are created and safeguarded by\r\nour institutions; and it is therefore our right and our duty to see\r\nthat they work in harmony with these institutions.\r\n\r\nThe first essential in determining how to deal with the great\r\nindustrial combinations is knowledge of the facts—publicity. In the\r\ninterest of the public, the government should have the right to\r\ninspect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged\r\nin interstate business. Publicity is the only sure remedy which\r\nwe can now invoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of\r\ngovernmental regulation, or taxation, can only be determined after\r\npublicity has been obtained, by process of law, and in the course\r\nof administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and\r\ncomplete—knowledge which may be made public to the world.\r\n\r\nArtificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other\r\nassociations, depending upon any statutory law for their existence or\r\nprivileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, and\r\nfull and accurate information as to their operations should be made\r\npublic regularly at reasonable intervals.\r\n\r\nThe large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in\r\none State, always do business in many States, often doing very little\r\nbusiness in the State where they are incorporated. There is utter lack\r\nof uniformity in the State laws about them; and as no State has any\r\nexclusive interest in or power over their acts, it has in practice\r\nproved impossible to get adequate regulation through State action.\r\nTherefore, in the interest of the whole people, the Nation should,\r\nwithout interfering with the power of the States in the matter itself,\r\nalso assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations\r\ndoing an interstate business. This is especially true where the\r\ncorporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some\r\nmonopolistic element or tendency in its business. There would be no\r\nhardship in such supervision; banks are subject to it, and in their\r\ncase it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed, it is\r\nprobable that supervision of corporations by the National Government\r\nneed not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised\r\nover them by so conservative a State as Massachusetts, in order to\r\nproduce excellent results.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike in\r\nindustrial and political conditions, which were to take place by the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as a\r\nmatter of course that the several States were the proper authorities\r\nto regulate, so far as was then necessary, the comparatively\r\ninsignificant and strictly localized corporate bodies of the day.\r\nThe conditions are now wholly different and wholly different action\r\nis called for. I believe that a law can be framed which will enable\r\nthe National Government to exercise control along the lines above\r\nindicated, profiting by the experience gained through the passage\r\nand administration of the Interstate Commerce Act. If, however, the\r\njudgment of the Congress is that it lacks the constitutional power to\r\npass such an act, then a constitutional amendment should be submitted\r\nto confer the power.\r\n\r\nThere should be created a Cabinet officer, to be known as Secretary\r\nof Commerce and Industries, as provided in the bill introduced at the\r\nlast session of the Congress. It should be his province to deal with\r\ncommerce in its broadest sense; including among many other things\r\nwhatever concerns labor and all matters affecting the great business\r\ncorporations and our merchant marine.\r\n\r\nThe course proposed is one phase of what should be a comprehensive\r\nand far-reaching scheme of constructive statesmanship for the purpose\r\nof broadening our markets, securing our business interests on a\r\nsafe basis, and making firm our new position in the international\r\nindustrial world, while scrupulously safeguarding the rights of\r\nwage-worker and capitalist, of investor and private citizen, so as to\r\nsecure equity as between man and man in this Republic.\r\n\r\nWith the sole exception of the farming interest, no one matter is\r\nof such vital moment to our whole people as the welfare of the\r\nwage-workers. If the farmer and the wage-worker are well off, it\r\nis absolutely certain that all others will be well off too. It is\r\ntherefore a matter for hearty congratulation that on the whole wages\r\nare higher to-day in the United States than ever before in our\r\nhistory, and far higher than in any other country. The standard of\r\nliving is also higher than ever before. Every effort of legislator\r\nand administrator should be bent to secure the permanency of this\r\ncondition of things and its improvement wherever possible. Not only\r\nmust our labor be protected by the tariff, but it should also be\r\nprotected so far as it is possible from the presence in this country\r\nof any laborers brought over by contract, or of those who, coming\r\nfreely, yet represent a standard of living so depressed that they\r\ncan undersell our men in the labor market and drag them to a lower\r\nlevel. I regard it as necessary, with this end in view, to re-enact\r\nimmediately the law excluding Chinese laborers and to strengthen it\r\nwherever necessary in order to make its enforcement entirely effective.\r\n\r\nThe National Government should demand the highest quality of service\r\nfrom its employees; and in return it should be a good employer.\r\nIf possible legislation should be passed, in connection with the\r\nInterstate Commerce Law, which will render effective the efforts of\r\ndifferent States to do away with the competition of convict contract\r\nlabor in the open labor market. So far as practicable under the\r\nconditions of government work, provision should be made to render the\r\nenforcement of the eight-hour law easy and certain. In all industries\r\ncarried on directly or indirectly for the United States Government\r\nwomen and children should be protected from excessive hours of\r\nlabor, from night work, and from work under unsanitary conditions.\r\nThe government should provide in its contracts that all work should\r\nbe done under “fair” conditions, and in addition to setting a high\r\nstandard should uphold it by proper inspection, extending if necessary\r\nto the subcontractors. The government should forbid all night work\r\nfor women and children, as well as excessive overtime. For the\r\nDistrict of Columbia a good factory law should be passed; and, as a\r\npowerful indirect aid to such laws, provision should be made to turn\r\nthe inhabited alleys, the existence of which is a reproach to our\r\nCapital City, into minor streets, where the inhabitants can live under\r\nconditions favorable to health and morals.\r\n\r\nAmerican wage-workers work with their heads as well as their hands.\r\nMoreover, they take a keen pride in what they are doing; so that,\r\nindependent of the reward, they wish to turn out a perfect job. This\r\nis the great secret of our success in competition with the labor of\r\nforeign countries.\r\n\r\nThe most vital problem with which this country, and for that matter\r\nthe whole civilized world, has to deal, is the problem which has for\r\none side the betterment of social conditions, moral and physical, in\r\nlarge cities, and for another side the effort to deal with that tangle\r\nof far-reaching questions which we group together when we speak of\r\n“labor.” The chief factor in the success of each man—wage-worker,\r\nfarmer, and capitalist alike—must ever be the sum total of his own\r\nindividual qualities and abilities. Second only to this comes the\r\npower of acting in combination or association with others. Very great\r\ngood has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of\r\nwage-workers, when managed with forethought, and when they combine\r\ninsistence upon their own rights with law-abiding respect for the\r\nrights of others. The display of these qualities in such bodies is\r\na duty to the nation no less than to the associations themselves.\r\nFinally, there must also in many cases be action by the government\r\nin order to safeguard the rights and interests of all. Under our\r\nConstitution there is much more scope for such action by the State\r\nand the municipality than by the nation. But on points such as those\r\ntouched on above the National Government can act.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, the rule of brotherhood remains as the\r\nindispensable prerequisite to success in the kind of national life\r\nfor which we strive. Each man must work for himself, and unless he so\r\nworks no outside help can avail him; but each man must remember also\r\nthat he is indeed his brother’s keeper, and that while no man who\r\nrefuses to walk can be carried with advantage to himself or any one\r\nelse, yet that each at times stumbles or halts, that each at times\r\nneeds to have the helping hand outstretched to him. To be permanently\r\neffective, aid must always take the form of helping a man to help\r\nhimself; and we can all best help ourselves by joining together in the\r\nwork that is of common interest to all.\r\n\r\nOur present immigration laws are unsatisfactory. We need every\r\nhonest and efficient immigrant fitted to become an American citizen,\r\nevery immigrant who comes here to stay, who brings here a strong\r\nbody, a stout heart, a good head, and a resolute purpose to do his\r\nduty well in every way and to bring up his children as law-abiding\r\nand God-fearing members of the community. But there should be a\r\ncomprehensive law enacted with the object of working a threefold\r\nimprovement over our present system. First, we should aim to exclude\r\nabsolutely not only all persons who are known to be believers in\r\nanarchistic principles or members of anarchistic societies, but also\r\nall persons who are of a low moral tendency or of unsavory reputation.\r\nThis means that we should require a more thorough system of inspection\r\nabroad and a more rigid system of examination at our immigration\r\nports, the former being especially necessary.\r\n\r\nThe second object of a proper immigration law ought to be to secure\r\nby a careful and not merely perfunctory educational test some\r\nintelligent capacity to appreciate American institutions and act\r\nsanely as American citizens. This would not keep out all anarchists,\r\nfor many of them belong to the intelligent criminal class. But it\r\nwould do what is also in point, that is, tend to decrease the sum\r\nof ignorance, so potent in producing the envy, suspicion, malignant\r\npassion, and hatred of order, out of which anarchistic sentiment\r\ninevitably springs. Finally, all persons should be excluded who are\r\nbelow a certain standard of economic fitness to enter our industrial\r\nfield as competitors with American labor. There should be proper\r\nproof of personal capacity to earn an American living and enough\r\nmoney to ensure a decent start under American conditions. This would\r\nstop the influx of cheap labor, and the resulting competition which\r\ngives rise to so much of bitterness in American industrial life; and\r\nit would dry up the springs of the pestilential social conditions in\r\nour great cities, where anarchistic organizations have their greatest\r\npossibility of growth.\r\n\r\nBoth the educational and economic tests in a wise immigration law\r\nshould be designed to protect and elevate the general body politic\r\nand social. A very close supervision should be exercised over the\r\nsteamship companies which mainly bring over the immigrants, and they\r\nshould be held to a strict accountability for any infraction of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is general acquiescence in our present tariff system as a\r\nnational policy. The first requisite to our prosperity is the\r\ncontinuity and stability of this economic policy. Nothing could be\r\nmore unwise than to disturb the business interests of the country\r\nby any general tariff change at this time. Doubt, apprehension,\r\nuncertainty are exactly what we most wish to avoid in the interest of\r\nour commercial and material well-being. Our experience in the past\r\nhas shown that sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt to produce\r\nconditions closely approaching panic in the business world. Yet it\r\nis not only possible, but eminently desirable, to combine with the\r\nstability of our economic system a supplementary system of reciprocal\r\nbenefit and obligation with other nations. Such reciprocity is an\r\nincident and result of the firm establishment and preservation of our\r\npresent economic policy. It was specially provided for in the present\r\ntariff law.\r\n\r\nReciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our first\r\nduty is to see that the protection granted by the tariff in every case\r\nwhere it is needed is maintained, and that reciprocity be sought for\r\nso far as it can safely be done without injury to our home industries.\r\nJust how far this is must be determined according to the individual\r\ncase, remembering always that every application of our tariff policy\r\nto meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the\r\ncardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the point\r\nthat will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad.\r\nThe well-being of the wage-worker is a prime consideration of our\r\nentire policy of economic legislation.\r\n\r\nSubject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our\r\nindustrial well-being at home, the principle of reciprocity must\r\ncommand our hearty support. The phenomenal growth of our export trade\r\nemphasizes the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a liberal\r\npolicy in dealing with foreign nations. Whatever is merely petty and\r\nvexatious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The\r\ncustomers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in the long run,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, purchase those surplus products by giving us\r\nsomething in return. Their ability to purchase our products should as\r\nfar as possible be secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable\r\nus to take from them those products which we can use without harm to\r\nour own industries and labor, or the use of which will be of marked\r\nbenefit to us.\r\n\r\nIt is most important that we should maintain the high level of our\r\npresent prosperity. We have now reached the point in the development\r\nof our interests where we are not only able to supply our own markets\r\nbut to produce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find\r\nmarkets abroad. To secure these markets we can utilize existing\r\nduties in any case where they are no longer needed for the purpose of\r\nprotection, or in any case where the article is not produced here and\r\nthe duty is no longer necessary for revenue, as giving us something to\r\noffer in exchange for what we ask. The cordial relations with other\r\nnations which are so desirable will naturally be promoted by the\r\ncourse thus required by our own interests.\r\n\r\nThe natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be\r\nin connection with those of our productions which no longer require\r\nall of the support once needed to establish them upon a sound basis,\r\nand with those others where either because of natural or of economic\r\ncauses we are beyond the reach of successful competition.\r\n\r\nI ask the attention of the Senate to the reciprocity treaties laid\r\nbefore it by my predecessor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe condition of the American merchant marine is such as to call for\r\nimmediate remedial action by the Congress. It is discreditable to us\r\nas a nation that our merchant marine should be utterly insignificant\r\nin comparison to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms\r\nof business. We should not longer submit to conditions under which\r\nonly a trifling portion of our great commerce is carried in our own\r\nships. To remedy this state of things would not merely serve to build\r\nup our shipping interests, but it would also result in benefit to all\r\nwho are interested in the permanent establishment of a wider market\r\nfor American products, and would provide an auxiliary force for the\r\nnavy. Ships work for their own countries just as railroads work for\r\ntheir terminal points. Shipping lines, if established to the principal\r\ncountries with which we have dealings, would be of political as well\r\nas commercial benefit. From every standpoint it is unwise for the\r\nUnited States to continue to rely upon the ships of competing nations\r\nfor the distribution of our goods. It should be made advantageous to\r\ncarry American goods in American-built ships.\r\n\r\nAt present American shipping is under certain great disadvantages when\r\nput in competition with the shipping of foreign countries. Many of the\r\nfast foreign steamships, at a speed of fourteen knots or above, are\r\nsubsidized; and all our ships, sailing vessels and steamers alike,\r\ncargo carriers of slow speed and mail carriers of high speed, have to\r\nmeet the fact that the original cost of building American ships is\r\ngreater than is the case abroad; that the wages paid the officers and\r\nseamen are very much higher than those paid the officers and seamen of\r\nforeign competing countries; and that the standard of living on our\r\nships is far superior to the standard of living on the ships of our\r\ncommercial rivals.\r\n\r\nOur government should take such action as will remedy these\r\ninequalities. The American merchant marine should be restored to the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Act of March 14, 1900, intended unequivocally to establish gold\r\nas the standard money and to maintain at a parity therewith all forms\r\nof money medium in use with us, has been shown to be timely and\r\njudicious. The price of our government bonds in the world’s market,\r\nwhen compared with the price of similar obligations issued by other\r\nnations, is a flattering tribute to our public credit. This condition\r\nit is evidently desirable to maintain.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the National Banking Law furnishes sufficient liberty\r\nfor the proper exercise of the banking function; but there seems\r\nto be need of better safeguards against the deranging influence of\r\ncommercial crises and financial panics. Moreover, the currency of the\r\ncountry should be made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade\r\nand commerce.\r\n\r\nThe collections from duties on imports and internal taxes continue\r\nto exceed the ordinary expenditures of the government, thanks mainly\r\nto the reduced army expenditures. The utmost care should be taken\r\nnot to reduce the revenues so that there will be any possibility of\r\na deficit; but, after providing against any such contingency, means\r\nshould be adopted which will bring the revenues more nearly within the\r\nlimit of our actual needs. In his report to the Congress the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury considers all these questions at length, and I ask\r\nyour attention to the report and recommendations.\r\n\r\nI call special attention to the need of strict economy in\r\nexpenditures. The fact that our national needs forbid us to be\r\nniggardly in providing whatever is actually necessary to our\r\nwell-being, should make us doubly careful to husband our national\r\nresources, as each of us husbands his private resources, by scrupulous\r\navoidance of anything like wasteful or reckless expenditure. Only by\r\navoidance of spending money on what is needless or unjustifiable can\r\nwe legitimately keep our income to the point required to meet our\r\nneeds that are genuine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1887 a measure was enacted for the regulation of interstate\r\nrailways, commonly known as the Interstate Commerce Act. The cardinal\r\nprovisions of that act were that railway rates should be just and\r\nreasonable and that all shippers, localities, and commodities should\r\nbe accorded equal treatment. A commission was created and endowed\r\nwith what were supposed to be the necessary powers to execute the\r\nprovisions of this act.\r\n\r\nThat law was largely an experiment. Experience has shown the wisdom\r\nof its purposes, but has also shown, possibly that some of its\r\nrequirements are wrong, certainly that the means devised for the\r\nenforcement of its provisions are defective. Those who complain of\r\nthe management of the railways allege that established rates are not\r\nmaintained; that rebates and similar devices are habitually resorted\r\nto; that these preferences are usually in favor of the large shipper;\r\nthat they drive out of business the smaller competitor; that while\r\nmany rates are too low, many others are excessive; and that gross\r\npreferences are made, affecting both localities and commodities. Upon\r\nthe other hand, the railways assert that the law by its very terms\r\ntends to produce many of these illegal practices by depriving carriers\r\nof that right of concerted action which they claim is necessary to\r\nestablish and maintain non-discriminating rates.\r\n\r\nThe act should be amended. The railway is a public servant. Its rates\r\nshould be just to and open to all shippers alike. The government\r\nshould see to it that within its jurisdiction this is so and should\r\nprovide a speedy, inexpensive, and effective remedy to that end.\r\nAt the same time it must not be forgotten that our railways are the\r\narteries through which the commercial lifeblood of this nation flows.\r\nNothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which\r\nwould unnecessarily interfere with the development and operation of\r\nthese commercial agencies. The subject is one of great importance and\r\ncalls for the earnest attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture during the past fifteen years has\r\nsteadily broadened its work on economic lines, and has accomplished\r\nresults of real value in upbuilding domestic and foreign trade. It\r\nhas gone into new fields until it is now in touch with all sections\r\nof our country and with two of the island groups that have lately\r\ncome under our jurisdiction, whose people must look to agriculture as\r\na livelihood. It is searching the world for grains, grasses, fruits,\r\nand vegetables specially fitted for introduction into localities in\r\nthe several States and Territories where they may add materially to\r\nour resources. By scientific attention to soil survey and possible\r\nnew crops, to breeding of new varieties of plants, to experimental\r\nshipments, to animal industry and applied chemistry, very practical\r\naid has been given our farming and stock-growing interests. The\r\nproducts of the farm have taken an unprecedented place in our export\r\ntrade during the year that has just closed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPublic opinion throughout the United States has moved steadily toward\r\na just appreciation of the value of forests, whether planted or of\r\nnatural growth. The great part played by them in the creation and\r\nmaintenance of the national wealth is now more fully realized than\r\never before.\r\n\r\nWise forest protection does not mean the withdrawal of forest\r\nresources, whether of wood, water, or grass, from contributing their\r\nfull share to the welfare of the people, but, on the contrary, gives\r\nthe assurance of larger and more certain supplies. The fundamental\r\nidea of forestry is the perpetuation of forests by use. Forest\r\nprotection is not an end of itself; it is a means to increase and\r\nsustain the resources of our country and the industries which depend\r\nupon them. The preservation of our forests is an imperative business\r\nnecessity. We have come to see clearly that whatever destroys the\r\nforest, except to make way for agriculture, threatens our well-being.\r\n\r\nThe practical usefulness of the national forest reserves to the\r\nmining, grazing, irrigation, and other interests of the regions in\r\nwhich the reserves lie has led to a widespread demand by the people\r\nof the West for their protection and extension. The forest reserves\r\nwill inevitably be of still greater use in the future than in the\r\npast. Additions should be made to them whenever practicable, and their\r\nusefulness should be increased by a thoroughly businesslike management.\r\n\r\nAt present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the\r\nGeneral Land Office, the mapping and description of their timber with\r\nthe United States Geological Survey, and the preparation of plans for\r\ntheir conservative use with the Bureau of Forestry, which is also\r\ncharged with the general advancement of practical forestry in the\r\nUnited States. These various functions should be united in the Bureau\r\nof Forestry, to which they properly belong. The present diffusion\r\nof responsibility is bad from every standpoint. It prevents that\r\neffective co-operation between the government and the men who utilize\r\nthe resources of the reserves, without which the interests of both\r\nmust suffer. The scientific bureaus generally should be put under the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. The President should have by law the power\r\nof transferring lands for use as forest reserves to the Department of\r\nAgriculture. He already has such power in the case of lands needed by\r\nthe Departments of War and the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe wise administration of the forest reserves will be not less\r\nhelpful to the interests which depend on water than to those which\r\ndepend on wood and grass. The water supply itself depends upon the\r\nforest. In the arid region it is water, not land, which measures\r\nproduction. The western half of the United States would sustain a\r\npopulation greater than that of our whole country to-day if the waters\r\nthat now run to waste were saved and used for irrigation. The forest\r\nand water problems are perhaps the most vital internal questions of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nCertain of the forest reserves should also be made preserves for the\r\nwild forest creatures. All of the reserves should be better protected\r\nfrom fires. Many of them need special protection because of the great\r\ninjury done by live stock, above all by sheep. The increase in deer,\r\nelk, and other animals in the Yellowstone Park shows what may be\r\nexpected when other mountain forests are properly protected by law\r\nand properly guarded. Some of these areas have been so denuded of\r\nsurface vegetation by over-grazing that the ground breeding birds,\r\nincluding grouse and quail, and many mammals, including deer, have\r\nbeen exterminated or driven away. At the same time the water-storing\r\ncapacity of the surface has been decreased or destroyed, thus\r\npromoting floods in times of rain and diminishing the flow of streams\r\nbetween rains.\r\n\r\nIn cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few\r\nyears, vegetation has again carpeted the ground, birds and deer are\r\ncoming back, and hundreds of persons, especially from the immediate\r\nneighborhood, come each summer to enjoy the privilege of camping. Some\r\nat least of the forest reserves should afford perpetual protection\r\nto the native fauna and flora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly\r\ndiminishing wild animals of the larger kinds, and free camping grounds\r\nfor the ever-increasing numbers of men and women who have learned\r\nto find rest, health, and recreation in the splendid forests and\r\nflower-clad meadows of our mountains. The forest reserves should be\r\nset apart forever for the use and benefit of our people as a whole\r\nand not sacrificed to the shortsighted greed of a few.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe forests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the streams in\r\nflood and replenishing them in drought they make possible the use\r\nof waters otherwise wasted. They prevent the soil from washing, and\r\nso protect the storage reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest\r\nconservation is therefore an essential condition of water conservation.\r\n\r\nThe forests alone can not, however, fully regulate and conserve the\r\nwaters of the arid region. Great storage works are necessary to\r\nequalize the flow of streams and to save the flood waters. Their\r\nconstruction has been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vast\r\nfor private effort. Nor can it be best accomplished by the individual\r\nStates acting alone. Far-reaching interstate problems are involved;\r\nand the resources of single States would often be inadequate. It is\r\nproperly a national function, at least in some of its features. It is\r\nas right for the National Government to make the streams and rivers of\r\nthe arid region useful by engineering works for water storage as to\r\nmake useful the rivers and harbors of the humid region by engineering\r\nworks of another kind. The storing of the floods in reservoirs at the\r\nheadwaters of our rivers is but an enlargement of our present policy\r\nof river control, under which levees are built on the lower reaches of\r\nthe same streams.\r\n\r\nThe Government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it\r\ndoes other public works. Where their purpose is to regulate the flow\r\nof streams, the water should be turned freely into the channels in the\r\ndry season to take the same course under the same laws as the natural\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nThe reclamation of the unsettled arid public lands presents a\r\ndifferent problem. Here it is not enough to regulate the flow of\r\nstreams. The object of the government is to dispose of the land to\r\nsettlers who will build homes upon it. To accomplish this object water\r\nmust be brought within their reach.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer settlers on the arid public domain chose their homes along\r\nstreams from which they could themselves divert the water to reclaim\r\ntheir holdings. Such opportunities are practically gone. There remain,\r\nhowever, vast areas of public land which can be made available for\r\nhomestead settlement, but only by reservoirs and main-line canals\r\nimpracticable for private enterprise. These irrigation works should\r\nbe built by the National Government. The lands reclaimed by them\r\nshould be reserved by the Government for actual settlers, and the\r\ncost of construction should so far as possible be repaid by the\r\nland reclaimed. The distribution of the water, the division of the\r\nstreams among irrigators, should be left to the settlers themselves in\r\nconformity with State laws and without interference with those laws or\r\nwith vested rights. The policy of the National Government should be to\r\naid irrigation in the several States and Territories in such manner as\r\nwill enable the people in the local communities to help themselves,\r\nand as will stimulate needed reforms in the State laws and regulations\r\ngoverning irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every\r\nportion of our country, just as the settlement of the Ohio and\r\nMississippi Valleys brought prosperity to the Atlantic States. The\r\nincreased demand for manufactured articles will stimulate industrial\r\nproduction, while wider home markets and the trade of Asia will\r\nconsume the larger food supplies and effectually prevent Western\r\ncompetition with Eastern agriculture. Indeed, the products of\r\nirrigation will be consumed chiefly in upbuilding local centres of\r\nmining and other industries, which would otherwise not come into\r\nexistence at all. Our people as a whole will profit, for successful\r\nhome-making is but another name for the upbuilding of the Nation.\r\n\r\nThe necessary foundation has already been laid for the inauguration\r\nof the policy just described. It would be unwise to begin by doing\r\ntoo much, for a great deal will doubtless be learned, both as to\r\nwhat can and what can not be safely attempted, by the early efforts,\r\nwhich must of necessity be partly experimental in character. At the\r\nvery beginning the Government should make clear, beyond shadow of\r\ndoubt, its intention to pursue this policy on lines of the broadest\r\npublic interest. No reservoir or canal should ever be built to satisfy\r\nselfish personal or local interests; but only in accordance with the\r\nadvice of trained experts, after long investigation has shown the\r\nlocality where all the conditions combine to make the work most needed\r\nand fraught with the greatest usefulness to the community as a whole.\r\nThere should be no extravagance, and the believers in the need of\r\nirrigation will most benefit their cause by seeing to it that it is\r\nfree from the least taint of excessive or reckless expenditure of the\r\npublic moneys.\r\n\r\nWhatever the Nation does for the extension of irrigation should\r\nharmonize with, and tend to improve, the condition of those now\r\nliving on irrigated land. We are not at the starting point of this\r\ndevelopment. Over two hundred millions of private capital has already\r\nbeen expended in the construction of irrigation works, and many\r\nmillion acres of arid land reclaimed. A high degree of enterprise and\r\nability has been shown in the work itself; but as much can not be said\r\nin reference to the laws relating thereto. The security and value of\r\nthe homes created depend largely on the stability of titles to water;\r\nbut the majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation of court\r\ndecisions rendered in ordinary suits at law. With a few creditable\r\nexceptions, the arid States have failed to provide for the certain and\r\njust division of streams in times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws\r\nhave made it possible to establish rights to water in excess of actual\r\nuses or necessities, and many streams have already passed into private\r\nownership, or a control equivalent to ownership.\r\n\r\nWhoever controls a stream practically controls the land it renders\r\nproductive, and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart from\r\nland can not prevail without causing enduring wrong. The recognition\r\nof such ownership, which has been permitted to grow up in the arid\r\nregions, should give way to a more enlightened and larger recognition\r\nof the rights of the public in the control and disposal of the public\r\nwater supplies. Laws founded upon conditions obtaining in humid\r\nregions, where water is too abundant to justify hoarding it, have no\r\nproper application in a dry country.\r\n\r\nIn the arid States the only right to water which should be recognized\r\nis that of use. In irrigation this right should attach to the land\r\nreclaimed and be inseparable therefrom. Granting perpetual water\r\nrights to others than users, without compensation to the public,\r\nis open to all the objections which apply to giving away perpetual\r\nfranchises to the public utilities of cities. A few of the Western\r\nStates have already recognized this, and have incorporated in their\r\nconstitutions the doctrine of perpetual State ownership of water.\r\n\r\nThe benefits which have followed the unaided development of the past\r\njustify the nation’s aid and co-operation in the more difficult and\r\nimportant work yet to be accomplished. Laws so vitally affecting\r\nhomes as those which control the water supply will only be effective\r\nwhen they have the sanction of the irrigators; reforms can only be\r\nfinal and satisfactory when they come through the enlightenment of\r\nthe people most concerned. The larger development which national aid\r\nensures should, however, awaken in every arid State the determination\r\nto make its irrigation system equal in justice and effectiveness\r\nthat of any country in the civilized world. Nothing could be more\r\nunwise than for isolated communities to continue to learn everything\r\nexperimentally, instead of profiting by what is already known\r\nelsewhere. We are dealing with a new and momentous question, in the\r\npregnant years while institutions are forming, and what we do will\r\naffect not only the present but future generations.\r\n\r\nOur aim should be not simply to reclaim the largest area of land and\r\nprovide homes for the largest number of people, but to create for this\r\nnew industry the best possible social and industrial conditions; and\r\nthis requires that we not only understand the existing situation, but\r\navail ourselves of the best experience of the time in the solution of\r\nits problems. A careful study should be made, both by the Nation and\r\nthe States, of the irrigation laws and conditions here and abroad.\r\nUltimately it will probably be necessary for the Nation to co-operate\r\nwith the several arid States in proportion as these States by their\r\nlegislation and administration show themselves fit to receive it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Hawaii our aim must be to develop the Territory on the traditional\r\nAmerican lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled\r\nby cheap labor; we wish a healthy American community of men who\r\nthemselves till the farms they own. All our legislation for the\r\nislands should be shaped with this end in view; the well-being of\r\nthe average home-maker must afford the true test of the healthy\r\ndevelopment of the islands. The land policy should as nearly as\r\npossible be modeled on our homestead system.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to say that it is hardly more necessary to report as\r\nto Porto Rico than as to any State or Territory within our continental\r\nlimits. The island is thriving as never before, and it is being\r\nadministered efficiently and honestly. Its people are now enjoying\r\nliberty and order under the protection of the United States, and\r\nupon this fact we congratulate them and ourselves. Their material\r\nwelfare must be as carefully and jealously considered as the welfare\r\nof any other portion of our country. We have given them the great\r\ngift of free access for their products to the markets of the United\r\nStates. I ask the attention of the Congress to the need of legislation\r\nconcerning the public lands of Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba such progress has been made toward putting the independent\r\ngovernment of the island upon a firm footing that before the present\r\nsession of the Congress closes this will be an accomplished fact. Cuba\r\nwill then start as her own mistress; and to the beautiful Queen of\r\nthe Antilles, as she unfolds this new page of her destiny, we extend\r\nour heartiest greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere I have discussed\r\nthe question of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, however, there are\r\nweighty reasons of morality and of national interest why the policy\r\nshould be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnestly\r\nask your attention to the wisdom, indeed to the vital need, of\r\nproviding for a substantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban\r\nimports into the United States. Cuba has in her Constitution affirmed\r\nwhat we desired, that she should stand, in international matters, in\r\ncloser and more friendly relations with us than with any other power;\r\nand we are bound by every consideration of honor and expediency to\r\npass commercial measures in the interest of her material well-being.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines our problem is larger. They are very rich tropical\r\nislands, inhabited by many varying tribes, representing widely\r\ndifferent stages of progress toward civilization. Our earnest effort\r\nis to help these people upward along the stony and difficult path that\r\nleads to self-government. We hope to make our administration of the\r\nislands honorable to our Nation by making it of the highest benefit to\r\nthe Filipinos themselves; and as an earnest of what we intend to do,\r\nwe point to what we have done. Already a greater measure of material\r\nprosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been\r\nattained in the Philippines than ever before in their history.\r\n\r\nIt is no light task for a nation to achieve the temperamental\r\nqualities without which the institutions of free government are but an\r\nempty mockery. Our people are now successfully governing themselves,\r\nbecause for more than a thousand years they have been slowly fitting\r\nthemselves, sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously, toward\r\nthis end. What has taken us thirty generations to achieve, we can not\r\nexpect to see another race accomplish out of hand, especially when\r\nlarge portions of that race start very far behind the point which our\r\nancestors had reached even thirty generations ago. In dealing with the\r\nPhilippine people we must show both patience and strength, forbearance\r\nand steadfast resolution. Our aim is high. We do not desire to do for\r\nthe islanders merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples\r\nby even the best foreign governments. We hope to do for them what has\r\nnever before been done for any people of the tropics—to make them fit\r\nfor self-government after the fashion of the really free nations.\r\n\r\nHistory may safely be challenged to show a single instance in which\r\na masterful race such as ours, having been forced by the exigencies\r\nof war to take possession of an alien land, has behaved to its\r\ninhabitants with the disinterested zeal for their progress that our\r\npeople have shown in the Philippines. To leave the islands at this\r\ntime would mean that they would fall into a welter of murderous\r\nanarchy. Such desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against\r\nhumanity. The character of Governor Taft and of his associates and\r\nsubordinates is a proof, if such be needed, of the sincerity of\r\nour effort to give the islanders a constantly increasing measure\r\nof self-government, exactly as fast as they show themselves fit\r\nto exercise it. Since the civil government was established not an\r\nappointment has been made in the islands with any reference to\r\nconsiderations of political influence, or to aught else save the\r\nfitness of the man and the needs of the service.\r\n\r\nIn our anxiety for the welfare and progress of the Philippines, it\r\nmay be that here and there we have gone too rapidly in giving them\r\nlocal self-government. It is on this side that our error, if any, has\r\nbeen committed. No competent observer, sincerely desirous of finding\r\nout the facts and influenced only by a desire for the welfare of the\r\nnatives, can assert that we have not gone far enough. We have gone\r\nto the very verge of safety in hastening the process. To have taken\r\na single step further or faster in advance would have been folly and\r\nweakness, and might well have been crime. We are extremely anxious\r\nthat the natives shall show the power of governing themselves. We\r\nare anxious, first for their sakes, and next, because it relieves us\r\nof a great burden. There need not be the slightest fear of our not\r\ncontinuing to give them all the liberty for which they are fit.\r\n\r\nThe only fear is lest in our overanxiety we give them a degree of\r\nindependence for which they are unfit, thereby inviting reaction\r\nand disaster. As fast as there is any reasonable hope that in a\r\ngiven district the people can govern themselves, self-government\r\nhas been given in that district. There is not a locality fitted for\r\nself-government which has not received it. But it may well be that in\r\ncertain cases it will have to be withdrawn because the inhabitants\r\nshow themselves unfit to exercise it; such instances have already\r\noccurred. In other words, there is not the slightest chance of our\r\nfailing to show a sufficiently humanitarian spirit. The danger comes\r\nin the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThere are still troubles ahead in the islands. The insurrection\r\nhas become an affair of local banditti and marauders, who deserve\r\nno higher regard than the brigands of portions of the Old World.\r\nEncouragement, direct or indirect, to these insurrectos stands on the\r\nsame footing as encouragement to hostile Indians in the days when we\r\nstill had Indian wars. Exactly as our aim is to give to the Indian who\r\nremains peaceful the fullest and amplest consideration, but to have it\r\nunderstood that we will show no weakness if he goes on the warpath,\r\nso we must make it evident, unless we are false to our own traditions\r\nand to the demands of civilization and humanity, that while we will do\r\neverything in our power for the Filipino who is peaceful, we will take\r\nthe sternest measures with the Filipino who follows the path of the\r\ninsurrecto and the ladrone.\r\n\r\nThe heartiest praise is due to large numbers of the natives of\r\nthe islands for their steadfast loyalty. The Macabebes have been\r\nconspicuous for their courage and devotion to the flag. I recommend\r\nthat the Secretary of War be empowered to take some systematic action\r\nin the way of aiding those of these men who are crippled in the\r\nservice and the families of those who are killed.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when there should be additional legislation for\r\nthe Philippines. Nothing better can be done for the islands than\r\nto introduce industrial enterprises. Nothing would benefit them so\r\nmuch as throwing them open to industrial development. The connection\r\nbetween idleness and mischief is proverbial, and the opportunity to\r\ndo remunerative work is one of the surest preventives of war. Of\r\ncourse no business man will go into the Philippines unless it is to\r\nhis interest to do so, and it is immensely to the interest of the\r\nislands that he should go in. It is therefore necessary that the\r\nCongress should pass laws by which the resources of the islands can\r\nbe developed; so that franchises (for limited terms of years) can be\r\ngranted to companies doing business in them, and every encouragement\r\nbe given to the incoming of business men of every kind.\r\n\r\nNot to permit this is to do a wrong to the Philippines. The franchises\r\nmust be granted and the business permitted only under regulations\r\nwhich will guarantee the islands against any kind of improper\r\nexploitation. But the vast natural wealth of the islands must be\r\ndeveloped, and the capital willing to develop it must be given the\r\nopportunity. The field must be thrown open to individual enterprise,\r\nwhich has been the real factor in the development of every region over\r\nwhich our flag has flown. It is urgently necessary to enact suitable\r\nlaws dealing with general transportation, mining, banking, currency,\r\nhomesteads, and the use and ownership of the lands and timber. These\r\nlaws will give free play to industrial enterprise; and the commercial\r\ndevelopment which will surely follow will afford to the people of the\r\nislands the best proofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to\r\nHawaii and the Philippines, to be continued from the Philippines to\r\npoints in Asia. We should not defer a day longer than necessary the\r\nconstruction of such a cable. It is demanded not merely for commercial\r\nbut for political and military considerations.\r\n\r\nEither the Congress should immediately provide for the construction\r\nof a government cable, or else an arrangement should be made by which\r\nlike advantages to those accruing from a government cable may be\r\nsecured to the Government by contract with a private cable company.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo single great material work which remains to be undertaken on\r\nthis continent is of such consequence to the American people as the\r\nbuilding of a canal across the Isthmus connecting North and South\r\nAmerica. Its importance to the Nation is by no means limited merely\r\nto its material effects upon our business prosperity; and yet with\r\nview to these effects alone it would be to the last degree important\r\nfor us immediately to begin it. While its beneficial effects would\r\nperhaps be most marked upon the Pacific Coast and the Gulf and South\r\nAtlantic States, it would also greatly benefit other sections. It\r\nis emphatically a work which it is for the interest of the entire\r\ncountry to begin and complete as soon as possible; it is one of those\r\ngreat works which only a great nation can undertake with prospects\r\nof success, and which when done are not only permanent assets in\r\nthe nation’s material interests, but standing monuments to its\r\nconstructive ability.\r\n\r\nI am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotiations on this\r\nsubject with Great Britain, conducted on both sides in a spirit of\r\nfriendliness and mutual good-will and respect, have resulted in my\r\nbeing able to lay before the Senate a treaty which if ratified will\r\nenable us to begin preparations for an Isthmian Canal at any time, and\r\nwhich guarantees to this Nation every right that it has ever asked\r\nin connection with the canal. In this treaty, the old Clayton-Bulwer\r\ntreaty, so long recognized as inadequate to supply the base for the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal, is\r\nabrogated. It specifically provides that the United States alone shall\r\ndo the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding\r\nthe canal and shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms\r\nof equality without the guarantee or interference of any outside\r\nnation from any quarter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before\r\nthe Senate, and if approved the Congress can then proceed to give\r\neffect to the advantages it secures us by providing for the building\r\nof the canal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe true end of every great and free people should be self-respecting\r\npeace; and this Nation most earnestly desires sincere and cordial\r\nfriendship with all others. Over the entire world, of recent years,\r\nwars between the great civilized powers have become less and less\r\nfrequent. Wars with barbarous or semi-barbarous peoples come in an\r\nentirely different category, being merely a most regrettable but\r\nnecessary international police duty which must be performed for the\r\nsake of the welfare of mankind. Peace can only be kept with certainty\r\nwhere both sides wish to keep it; but more and more the civilized\r\npeoples are realizing the wicked folly of war and are attaining that\r\ncondition of just and intelligent regard for the rights of others\r\nwhich will in the end, as we hope and believe, make world-wide peace\r\npossible. The peace conference at The Hague gave definite expression\r\nto this hope and belief and marked a stride toward their attainment.\r\n\r\nThis same peace conference acquiesced in our statement of the Monroe\r\nDoctrine as compatible with the purposes and aims of the conference.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign\r\npolicy of all the nations of the two Americas, as it is of the United\r\nStates. Just seventy-eight years have passed since President Monroe\r\nin his Annual Message announced that “The American continents are\r\nhenceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization\r\nby any European power.” In other words, the Monroe Doctrine is a\r\ndeclaration that there must be no territorial aggrandizement by any\r\nnon-American power at the expense of any American power on American\r\nsoil. It is in no wise intended as hostile to any nation in the Old\r\nWorld. Still less is it intended to give cover to any aggression by\r\none New World power at the expense of any other. It is simply a step,\r\nand a long step, toward assuring the universal peace of the world by\r\nsecuring the possibility of permanent peace on this hemisphere.\r\n\r\nDuring the past century other influences have established the\r\npermanence and independence of the smaller states of Europe. Through\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine we hope to be able to safeguard like independence\r\nand secure like permanence for the lesser among the New World nations.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of\r\nany American power, save that it in truth allows each of them to\r\nform such as it desires. In other words, it is really a guaranty of\r\nthe commercial independence of the Americas. We do not ask under\r\nthis doctrine for any exclusive commercial dealings with any other\r\nAmerican state. We do not guarantee any state against punishment if it\r\nmisconducts itself, provided that punishment does not take the form of\r\nthe acquisition of territory by any non-American power.\r\n\r\nOur attitude in Cuba is a sufficient guaranty of our own good faith.\r\nWe have not the slightest desire to secure any territory at the\r\nexpense of any of our neighbors. We wish to work with them hand in\r\nhand, so that all of us may be uplifted together, and we rejoice\r\nover the good fortune of any of them, we gladly hail their material\r\nprosperity and political stability, and are concerned and alarmed if\r\nany of them fall into industrial or political chaos. We do not wish\r\nto see any Old World military power grow up on this continent, or to\r\nbe compelled to become a military power ourselves. The peoples of the\r\nAmericas can prosper best if left to work out their own salvation in\r\ntheir own way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe work of upbuilding the navy must be steadily continued. No one\r\npoint of our policy, foreign or domestic, is more important than this\r\nto the honor and material welfare, and above all to the peace, of our\r\nNation in the future. Whether we desire it or not, we must henceforth\r\nrecognize that we have international duties no less than international\r\nrights. Even if our flag were hauled down in the Philippines and Porto\r\nRico, even if we decided not to build the Isthmian Canal, we should\r\nneed a thoroughly trained navy of adequate size, or else be prepared\r\ndefinitely and for all time to abandon the idea that our Nation\r\nis among those whose sons go down to the sea in ships. Unless our\r\ncommerce is always to be carried in foreign bottoms, we must have war\r\ncraft to protect it.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, however, as the American people have no thought of\r\nabandoning the path upon which they have entered, and especially in\r\nview of the fact that the building of the Isthmian Canal is fast\r\nbecoming one of the matters which the whole people are united in\r\ndemanding, it is imperative that our navy should be put and kept in\r\nthe highest state of efficiency, and should be made to answer to our\r\ngrowing needs. So far from being in any way a provocation to war, an\r\nadequate and highly trained navy is the best guaranty against war,\r\nthe cheapest and most effective peace insurance. The cost of building\r\nand maintaining such a navy represents the very lightest premium for\r\ninsuring peace which this nation can possibly pay.\r\n\r\nProbably no other great nation in the world is so anxious for peace\r\nas we are. There is not a single civilized power which has anything\r\nwhatever to fear from aggressiveness on our part. All we want is\r\npeace; and toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same\r\nrespect for our rights from others which we are eager and anxious\r\nto extend to their rights in return, to insure fair treatment to us\r\ncommercially, and to guarantee the safety of the American people.\r\n\r\nOur people intend to abide by the Monroe Doctrine and to insist\r\nupon it as the one sure means of securing the peace of the Western\r\nHemisphere. The navy offers us the only means of making our insistence\r\nupon the Monroe Doctrine anything but a subject of derision to\r\nwhatever nation chooses to disregard it. We desire the peace which\r\ncomes as of right to the just man armed; not the peace granted on\r\nterms of ignominy to the craven and the weakling.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to improvise a navy after war breaks out. The ships\r\nmust be built and the men trained long in advance. Some auxiliary\r\nvessels can be turned into makeshifts which will do in default of any\r\nbetter for the minor work, and a proportion of raw men can be mixed\r\nwith the highly trained, their shortcomings being made good by the\r\nskill of their fellows; but the efficient fighting force of the navy\r\nwhen pitted against an equal opponent will be found almost exclusively\r\nin the warships that have been regularly built and in the officers and\r\nmen who through years of faithful performance of sea duty have been\r\ntrained to handle their formidable but complex and delicate weapons\r\nwith the highest efficiency. In the late war with Spain the ships that\r\ndealt the decisive blows at Manila and Santiago had been launched from\r\ntwo to fourteen years, and they were able to do as they did because\r\nthe men in the conning towers, the gun-turrets, and the engine-rooms\r\nhad through long years of practice at sea learned how to do their duty.\r\n\r\nOur present navy was begun in 1882. At that period our navy consisted\r\nof a collection of antiquated wooden ships, already almost as out of\r\nplace against modern war vessels as the galleys of Alcibiades and\r\nHamilcar—certainly as the ships of Tromp and Blake. Nor at that time\r\ndid we have men fit to handle a modern man-of-war. Under the wise\r\nlegislation of the Congress and the successful administration of a\r\nsuccession of patriotic Secretaries of the Navy, belonging to both\r\npolitical parties, the work of upbuilding the navy went on, and ships\r\nequal to any in the world of their kind were continually added; and\r\nwhat was even more important, these ships were exercised at sea singly\r\nand in squadrons until the men aboard them were able to get the\r\nbest possible service out of them. The result was seen in the short\r\nwar with Spain, which was decided with such rapidity because of the\r\ninfinitely greater preparedness of our navy than of the Spanish navy.\r\n\r\nWhile awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded\r\nand manned the ships which destroyed the Spanish sea forces in the\r\nPhilippines and in Cuba, we must not forget that an equal meed of\r\npraise belongs to those without whom neither blow could have been\r\nstruck. The Congressmen who voted years in advance the money to\r\nlay down the ships, to build the guns, to buy the armor plate; the\r\nDepartment officials and the business men and wage-workers who\r\nfurnished what the Congress had authorized; the Secretaries of the\r\nNavy who asked for and expended the appropriations; and finally\r\nthe officers who, in fair weather and foul, on actual sea service,\r\ntrained and disciplined the crews of the ships when there was no war\r\nin sight—all are entitled to a full share in the glory of Manila and\r\nSantiago, and the respect accorded by every true American to those who\r\nwrought such signal triumph for our country. It was forethought and\r\npreparation which secured us the overwhelming triumph of 1898. If we\r\nfail to show forethought and preparation now, there may come a time\r\nwhen disaster will befall us instead of triumph; and should this time\r\ncome, the fault will rest primarily, not upon those whom the accident\r\nof events puts in supreme command at the moment, but upon those who\r\nhave failed to prepare in advance.\r\n\r\nThere should be no cessation in the work of completing our navy. So\r\nfar ingenuity has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the\r\ngreat war craft whose hammering guns beat out the mastery of the high\r\nseas. It is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several\r\nadditional battleships and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary\r\nand lighter craft in proportion; for the exact numbers and character\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy. But there\r\nis something we need even more than additional ships, and this is\r\nadditional officers and men. To provide battleships and cruisers and\r\nthen lay them up, with the expectation of leaving them unmanned until\r\nthey are needed in actual war, would be worse than folly; it would be\r\na crime against the nation.\r\n\r\nTo send any warship against a competent enemy unless those aboard it\r\nhave been trained by years of actual sea service, including incessant\r\ngunnery practice, would be to invite not merely disaster, but the\r\nbitterest shame and humiliation. Four thousand additional seamen and\r\none thousand additional marines should be provided; and an increase\r\nin the officers should be provided by making a large addition to\r\nthe classes at Annapolis. There is one small matter which should be\r\nmentioned in connection with Annapolis. The pretentious and unmeaning\r\ntitle of “naval cadet” should be abolished; the title of “midshipman,”\r\nfull of historic association, should be restored.\r\n\r\nEven in time of peace a warship should be used until it wears out,\r\nfor only so can it be kept fit to respond to any emergency. The\r\nofficers and men alike should be kept as much as possible on blue\r\nwater, for it is there only they can learn their duties as they\r\nshould be learned. The big vessels should be manœuvred in squadrons\r\ncontaining not merely battleships, but the necessary proportion of\r\ncruisers and scouts. The torpedo boats should be handled by the\r\nyounger officers in such manner as will best fit the latter to take\r\nresponsibility and meet the emergencies of actual warfare.\r\n\r\nEvery detail ashore which can be performed by a civilian should\r\nbe so performed, the officer being kept for his special duty in\r\nthe sea service. Above all, gunnery practice should be unceasing.\r\nIt is important to have our navy of adequate size, but it is even\r\nmore important that ship for ship it should equal in efficiency any\r\nnavy in the world. This is possible only with highly drilled crews\r\nand officers, and this in turn imperatively demands continuous and\r\nprogressive instruction in target practice, ship handling, squadron\r\ntactics, and general discipline. Our ships must be assembled in\r\nsquadrons actively cruising away from harbors and never long at\r\nanchor. The resulting wear upon engines and hulls must be endured;\r\na battleship worn out in long training of officers and men is well\r\npaid for by the results, while, on the other hand, no matter in how\r\nexcellent condition, it is useless if the crew be not expert.\r\n\r\nWe now have seventeen battleships appropriated for, of which nine are\r\ncompleted and have been commissioned for actual service. The remaining\r\neight will be ready in from two to four years, but it will take at\r\nleast that time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It is of\r\nvast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by the\r\ntime they are commissioned. Good ships and good guns are simply good\r\nweapons, and the best weapons are useless save in the hands of men who\r\nknow how to fight with them. The men must be trained and drilled under\r\na thorough and well-planned system of progressive instruction, while\r\nthe recruiting must be carried on with still greater vigor. Every\r\neffort must be made to exalt the main function of the officer—the\r\ncommand of men. The leading graduates of the Naval Academy should be\r\nassigned to the combatant branches, the line and marines.\r\n\r\nMany of the essentials of success are already recognized by the\r\nGeneral Board, which, as the central office of a growing staff, is\r\nmoving steadily toward a proper war efficiency and a proper efficiency\r\nof the whole Navy, under the Secretary. This General Board, by\r\nfostering the creation of a general staff, is providing for the\r\nofficial and then the general recognition of our altered conditions as\r\na nation and of the true meaning of a great war fleet, which meaning\r\nis, first, the best men, and, second, the best ships.\r\n\r\nThe Naval Militia forces are State organizations, and are trained for\r\ncoast service, and in event of war they will constitute the inner line\r\nof defence. They should receive hearty encouragement from the General\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut in addition we should at once provide for a National Naval\r\nReserve, organized and trained under the direction of the Navy\r\nDepartment, and subject to the call of the Chief Executive whenever\r\nwar becomes imminent. It should be a real auxiliary to the naval\r\nseagoing peace establishment, and offer material to be drawn on at\r\nonce for manning our ships in time of war. It should be composed\r\nof graduates of the Naval Academy, graduates of the Naval Militia,\r\nofficers and crews of coast-line steamers, longshore schooners,\r\nfishing vessels, and steam yachts, together with the coast population\r\nabout such centres as life-saving stations and light-houses.\r\n\r\nThe American people must either build and maintain an adequate navy\r\nor else make up their minds definitely to accept a secondary position\r\nin international affairs, not merely in political, but in commercial,\r\nmatters. It has been well said that there is no surer way of courting\r\nnational disaster than to be “opulent, aggressive, and unarmed.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to increase our army beyond its present size at\r\nthis time. But it is necessary to keep it at the highest point of\r\nefficiency. The individual units who as officers and enlisted men\r\ncompose this army, are, we have good reason to believe, at least as\r\nefficient as those of any other army in the entire world. It is our\r\nduty to see that their training is of a kind to insure the highest\r\npossible expression of power to these units when acting in combination.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of modern war are such as to make an infinitely heavier\r\ndemand than ever before upon the individual character and capacity of\r\nthe officer and the enlisted man, and to make it far more difficult\r\nfor men to act together with effect. At present the fighting must\r\nbe done in extended order, which means that each man must act for\r\nhimself and at the same time act in combination with others with whom\r\nhe is no longer in the old-fashioned elbow-to-elbow touch. Under such\r\nconditions a few men of the highest excellence are worth more than\r\nmany men without the special skill which is only found as the result\r\nof special training applied to men of exceptional physique and morale.\r\nBut nowadays the most valuable fighting man and the most difficult to\r\nperfect is the rifleman who is also a skilful and daring rider.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of our cavalry regiments has wisely been increased.\r\nThe American cavalryman, trained to manœuvre and fight with equal\r\nfacility on foot and on horseback, is the best type of soldier for\r\ngeneral purposes now to be found in the world. The ideal cavalryman of\r\nthe present day is a man who can fight on foot as effectively as the\r\nbest infantryman, and who is in addition unsurpassed in the care and\r\nmanagement of his horse and in his ability to fight on horseback.\r\n\r\nA general staff should be created. As for the present staff and supply\r\ndepartments, they should be filled by details from the line, the men\r\nso detailed returning after a while to their line duties. It is very\r\nundesirable to have the senior grades of the army composed of men\r\nwho have come to fill the positions by the mere fact of seniority. A\r\nsystem should be adopted by which there shall be an elimination grade\r\nby grade of those who seem unfit to render the best service in the\r\nnext grade. Justice to the veterans of the Civil War who are still in\r\nthe army would seem to require that in the matter of retirements they\r\nbe given by law the same privileges accorded to their comrades in the\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nThe process of elimination of the least fit should be conducted in a\r\nmanner that would render it practically impossible to apply political\r\nor social pressure on behalf of any candidate, so that each man may\r\nbe judged purely on his own merits. Pressure for the promotion of\r\ncivil officials for political reasons is bad enough, but it is tenfold\r\nworse where applied on behalf of officers of the army or navy. Every\r\npromotion and every detail under the War Department must be made\r\nsolely with regard to the good of the service and to the capacity and\r\nmerit of the man himself. No pressure, political, social, or personal,\r\nof any kind, will be permitted to exercise the least effect in any\r\nquestion of promotion or detail; and if there is reason to believe\r\nthat such pressure is exercised at the instigation of the officer\r\nconcerned, it will be held to militate against him. In our army we can\r\nnot afford to have rewards or duties distributed save on the simple\r\nground that those who by their own merits are entitled to the rewards\r\nget them, and that those who are peculiarly fit to do the duties are\r\nchosen to perform them.\r\n\r\nEvery effort should be made to bring the army to a constantly\r\nincreasing state of efficiency. When on actual service no work save\r\nthat directly in the line of such service should be required. The\r\npaper work in the army, as in the navy, should be greatly reduced.\r\nWhat is needed is proved power of command and capacity to work well\r\nin the field. Constant care is necessary to prevent dry rot in the\r\ntransportation and commissary departments.\r\n\r\nOur army is so small and so much scattered that it is very difficult\r\nto give the higher officers (as well as the lower officers and\r\nthe enlisted men) a chance to practice manœuvres in mass and on a\r\ncomparatively large scale. In time of need no amount of individual\r\nexcellence would avail against the paralysis which would follow\r\ninability to work as a coherent whole, under skilful and daring\r\nleadership. The Congress should provide means whereby it will be\r\npossible to have field exercises by at least a division of regulars,\r\nand if possible also a division of national guardsmen, once a year.\r\nThese exercises might take the form of field manœuvres; or, if on\r\nthe Gulf Coast or the Pacific or Atlantic Seaboard, or in the region\r\nof the Great Lakes, the army corps when assembled could be marched\r\nfrom some inland point to some point on the water, there embarked,\r\ndisembarked after a couple of days’ journey at some other point, and\r\nagain marched inland. Only by actual handling and providing for men in\r\nmasses while they are marching, camping, embarking, and disembarking,\r\nwill it be possible to train the higher officers to perform their\r\nduties well and smoothly.\r\n\r\nA great debt is owing from the public to the men of the army and navy.\r\nThey should be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point\r\nof efficiency, so that they may be able to respond instantly to any\r\ndemand made upon them to sustain the interests of the nation and the\r\nhonor of the flag. The individual American enlisted man is probably\r\non the whole a more formidable fighting man than the regular of any\r\nother army. Every consideration should be shown him, and in return the\r\nhighest standard of usefulness should be exacted from him. It is well\r\nworth while for the Congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted\r\nmen upon second and subsequent enlistments should not be increased to\r\ncorrespond with the increased value of the veteran soldier.\r\n\r\nMuch good has already come from the act reorganizing the army, passed\r\nearly in the present year. The three prime reforms, all of them of\r\nliterally inestimable value, are, first, the substitution of four-year\r\ndetails from the line for permanent appointments in the so-called\r\nstaff divisions; second, the establishment of a corps of artillery\r\nwith a chief at the head; third, the establishment of a maximum and\r\nminimum limit for the army. It would be difficult to overestimate the\r\nimprovement in the efficiency of our army which these three reforms\r\nare making, and have in part already effected.\r\n\r\nThe reorganization provided for by the act has been substantially\r\naccomplished. The improved conditions in the Philippines have\r\nenabled the War Department materially to reduce the military charge\r\nupon our revenue and to arrange the number of soldiers so as to\r\nbring this number much nearer to the minimum than to the maximum\r\nlimit established by law. There is, however, need of supplementary\r\nlegislation. Thorough military education must be provided, and in\r\naddition to the regulars the advantages of this education should be\r\ngiven to the officers of the National Guard and others in civil life\r\nwho desire intelligently to fit themselves for possible military duty.\r\nThe officers should be given the chance to perfect themselves by study\r\nin the higher branches of this art. At West Point the education should\r\nbe of the kind most apt to turn out men who are good in actual field\r\nservice; too much stress should not be laid on mathematics, nor should\r\nproficiency therein be held to establish the right of entry to a corps\r\nd’élite. The typical American officer of the best kind need not be a\r\ngood mathematician; but he must be able to master himself, to control\r\nothers, and to show boldness and fertility of resource in every\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nAction should be taken in reference to the militia and to the raising\r\nof volunteer forces. Our militia law is obsolete and worthless. The\r\norganization and armament of the National Guard of the several\r\nStates, which are treated as militia in the appropriations by the\r\nCongress, should be made identical with those provided for the regular\r\nforces. The obligations and duties of the Guard in time of war should\r\nbe carefully defined, and a system established by law under which the\r\nmethod of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed\r\nin advance. It is utterly impossible in the excitement and haste of\r\nimpending war to do this satisfactorily if the arrangements have not\r\nbeen made long beforehand. Provision should be made for utilizing in\r\nthe first volunteer organizations called out the training of those\r\ncitizens who have already had experience under arms, and especially\r\nfor the selection in advance of the officers of any force which may\r\nbe raised; for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible\r\nafter the outbreak of war.\r\n\r\nThat the army is not at all a mere instrument of destruction has been\r\nshown during the last three years. In the Philippines, Cuba, and Porto\r\nRico it has proved itself a great constructive force, a most potent\r\nimplement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civilization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo other citizens deserve so well of the Republic as the veterans, the\r\nsurvivors of those who saved the Union. They did the one deed which\r\nif left undone would have meant that all else in our history went\r\nfor nothing. But for their steadfast prowess in the greatest crisis\r\nof our history, all our annals would be meaningless, and our great\r\nexperiment in popular freedom and self-government a gloomy failure.\r\nMoreover, they not only left us a united nation, but they left us also\r\nas a heritage the memory of the mighty deeds by which the Nation was\r\nkept united. We are now indeed one nation, one in fact as well as in\r\nname; we are united in our devotion to the flag which is the symbol of\r\nnational greatness and unity; and the very completeness of our union\r\nenables us all, in every part of the country, to glory in the valor\r\nshown alike by the sons of the North and the sons of the South in the\r\ntimes that tried men’s souls.\r\n\r\nThe men who in the last three years have done so well in the East\r\nand the West Indies and on the mainland of Asia have shown that this\r\nremembrance is not lost. In any serious crisis the United States\r\nmust rely for the great mass of its fighting men upon the volunteer\r\nsoldiery who do not make a permanent profession of the military\r\ncareer; and whenever such a crisis arises the deathless memories of\r\nthe Civil War will give to Americans the lift of lofty purpose which\r\ncomes to those whose fathers have stood valiantly in the forefront of\r\nthe battle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe merit system of making appointments is in its essence as\r\ndemocratic and American as the common school system itself. It\r\nsimply means that in clerical and other positions where the duties\r\nare entirely non-political, all applicants should have a fair field\r\nand no favor, each standing on his merits as he is able to show them\r\nby practical test. Written competitive examinations offer the only\r\navailable means in many cases for applying this system. In other\r\ncases, as where laborers are employed, a system of registration\r\nundoubtedly can be widely extended. There are, of course, places\r\nwhere the written competitive examination can not be applied, and\r\nothers where it offers by no means an ideal solution, but where under\r\nexisting political conditions it is, though an imperfect means, yet\r\nthe best present means of getting satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nWherever the conditions have permitted the application of the merit\r\nsystem in its fullest and widest sense, the gain to the government has\r\nbeen immense. The navy yards and postal service illustrate, probably\r\nbetter than any other branches of the government, the great gain\r\nin economy, efficiency, and honesty due to the enforcement of this\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nI recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classified\r\nservice to the District of Columbia, or will at least enable the\r\nPresident thus to extend it. In my judgment all laws providing for the\r\ntemporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provision\r\nthat they be selected under the Civil Service Law.\r\n\r\nIt is important to have this system obtain at home, but it is even\r\nmore important to have it applied rigidly in our insular possessions.\r\nNot an office should be filled in the Philippines or Porto Rico with\r\nany regard to the man’s partisan affiliations or services, with any\r\nregard to the political, social, or personal influence which he may\r\nhave at his command; in short, heed should be paid to absolutely\r\nnothing save the man’s own character and capacity and the needs of the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe administration of these islands should be as wholly free from the\r\nsuspicion of partisan politics as the administration of the army and\r\nnavy. All that we ask from the public servant in the Philippines or\r\nPorto Rico is that he reflect honor on his country by the way in which\r\nhe makes that country’s rule a benefit to the peoples who have come\r\nunder it. This is all that we should ask, and we can not afford to be\r\ncontent with less.\r\n\r\nThe merit system is simply one method of securing honest and efficient\r\nadministration of the government; and in the long run the sole\r\njustification of any type of government lies in its proving itself\r\nboth honest and efficient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe consular service is now organized under the provisions of a law\r\npassed in 1856, which is entirely inadequate to existing conditions.\r\nThe interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout the country\r\nin the reorganization of the service is heartily commended to your\r\nattention. Several bills providing for a new consular service have in\r\nrecent years been submitted to the Congress. They are based upon the\r\njust principle that appointments to the service should be made only\r\nafter a practical test of the applicant’s fitness, that promotions\r\nshould be governed by trustworthiness, adaptability, and zeal in\r\nthe performance of duty, and that the tenure of office should be\r\nunaffected by partisan considerations.\r\n\r\nThe guardianship and fostering of our rapidly expanding foreign\r\ncommerce, the protection of American citizens resorting to foreign\r\ncountries in lawful pursuit of their affairs, and the maintenance of\r\nthe dignity of the Nation abroad, combine to make it essential that\r\nour consuls should be men of character, knowledge, and enterprise.\r\nIt is true that the service is now, in the main, efficient, but a\r\nstandard of excellence can not be permanently maintained until the\r\nprinciples set forth in the bills heretofore submitted to the Congress\r\non this subject are enacted into law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up\r\nour minds to recognize the Indian as an individual and not as a member\r\nof a tribe. The General Allotment Act is a mighty pulverizing engine\r\nto break up the tribal mass. It acts directly upon the family and the\r\nindividual. Under its provisions some sixty thousand Indians have\r\nalready become citizens of the United States. We should now break up\r\nthe tribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for the tribal\r\nlands; that is, they should be divided into individual holdings. There\r\nwill be a transition period during which the funds will in many cases\r\nhave to be held in trust. This is the case also with the lands. A stop\r\nshould be put upon the indiscriminate permission to Indians to lease\r\ntheir allotments. The effort should be steadily to make the Indian\r\nwork like any other man on his own ground. The marriage laws of the\r\nIndians should be made the same as those of the whites.\r\n\r\nIn the schools the education should be elementary and largely\r\nindustrial. The need of higher education among the Indians is very,\r\nvery limited. On the reservations care should be taken to try to suit\r\nthe teaching to the needs of the particular Indian. There is no use in\r\nattempting to induce agriculture in a country suited only for cattle\r\nraising, where the Indian should be made a stock grower. The ration\r\nsystem, which is merely the corral and the reservation system, is\r\nhighly detrimental to the Indians. It promotes beggary, perpetuates\r\npauperism, and stifles industry. It is an effectual barrier to\r\nprogress. It must continue to a greater or less degree as long as\r\ntribes are herded on reservations and have everything in common. The\r\nIndian should be treated as an individual—like the white man. During\r\nthe change of treatment inevitable hardships will occur; every effort\r\nshould be made to minimize these hardships; but we should not because\r\nof them hesitate to make the change. There should be a continuous\r\nreduction in the number of agencies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the aboriginal races few things are more important\r\nthan to preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradation\r\nresulting from the liquor traffic. We are doing all we can to save our\r\nown Indian tribes from this evil. Wherever by international agreement\r\nthis same end can be attained as regards races where we do not\r\npossess exclusive control, every effort should be made to bring it\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI bespeak the most cordial support from the Congress and the people\r\nfor the St. Louis Exposition to Commemorate the One Hundredth\r\nAnniversary of the Louisiana Purchase. This purchase was the greatest\r\ninstance of expansion in our history. It definitely decided that we\r\nwere to become a great continental republic, by far the foremost power\r\nin the Western Hemisphere. It is one of three or four great landmarks\r\nin our history—the great turning-points in our development. It is\r\neminently fitting that all our people should join with heartiest good\r\nwill in commemorating it, and the citizens of St. Louis, of Missouri,\r\nof all the adjacent region, are entitled to every aid in making the\r\ncelebration a noteworthy event in our annals. We earnestly hope that\r\nforeign nations will appreciate the deep interest our country takes in\r\nthis Exposition, and our view of its importance from every standpoint,\r\nand that they will participate in securing its success. The National\r\nGovernment should be represented by a full and complete set of\r\nexhibits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe people of Charleston, with great energy and civic spirit, are\r\ncarrying on an Exposition which will continue throughout most of the\r\npresent session of the Congress. I heartily commend this Exposition\r\nto the good will of the people. It deserves all the encouragement\r\nthat can be given it. The managers of the Charleston Exposition\r\nhave requested the Cabinet officers to place thereat the government\r\nexhibits which have been at Buffalo, promising to pay the necessary\r\nexpenses. I have taken the responsibility of directing that this be\r\ndone, for I feel that it is due to Charleston to help her in her\r\npraiseworthy effort. In my opinion the management should not be\r\nrequired to pay all these expenses. I earnestly recommend that the\r\nCongress appropriate at once the small sum necessary for this purpose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo has just closed. Both from the\r\nindustrial and the artistic standpoint this Exposition has been in a\r\nhigh degree creditable and useful, not merely to Buffalo but to the\r\nUnited States. The terrible tragedy of the President’s assassination\r\ninterfered materially with its being a financial success. The\r\nExposition was peculiarly in harmony with the trend of our public\r\npolicy, because it represented an effort to bring into closer touch\r\nall the peoples of the Western Hemisphere, and give them an increasing\r\nsense of unity. Such an effort was a genuine service to the entire\r\nAmerican public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe advancement of the highest interests of national science and\r\nlearning and the custody of objects of art and of the valuable results\r\nof scientific expeditions conducted by the United States have been\r\ncommitted to the Smithsonian Institution. In furtherance of its\r\ndeclared purpose—for the “increase and diffusion of knowledge among\r\nmen”—the Congress has from time to time given it other important\r\nfunctions. Such trusts have been executed by the Institution with\r\nnotable fidelity. There should be no halt in the work of the\r\nInstitution, in accordance with the plans which its Secretary has\r\npresented, for the preservation of the vanishing races of great North\r\nAmerican animals in the National Zoölogical Park. The urgent needs of\r\nthe National Museum are recommended to the favorable consideration of\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most characteristic educational movement of the past\r\nfifty years is that which has created the modern public library and\r\ndeveloped it into broad and active service. There are now over five\r\nthousand public libraries in the United States, the product of this\r\nperiod. In addition to accumulating material, they are also striving\r\nby organization, by improvement in method, and by co-operation, to\r\ngive greater efficiency to the material they hold, to make it more\r\nwidely useful, and by avoidance of unnecessary duplication in process\r\nto reduce the cost of its administration.\r\n\r\nIn these efforts they naturally look for assistance to the Federal\r\nlibrary, which, though still the Library of Congress, and so entitled,\r\nis the one national library of the United States. Already the largest\r\nsingle collection of books on the Western Hemisphere, and certain to\r\nincrease more rapidly than any other through purchase, exchange,\r\nand the operation of the copyright law, this library has a unique\r\nopportunity to render to the libraries of this country—to American\r\nscholarship—service of the highest importance. It is housed in a\r\nbuilding which is the largest and most magnificent yet erected for\r\nlibrary uses. Resources are now being provided which will develop\r\nthe collection properly, equip it with the apparatus and service\r\nnecessary to its effective use, render its bibliographic work widely\r\navailable, and enable it to become, not merely a centre of research,\r\nbut the chief factor in great co-operative efforts for the diffusion\r\nof knowledge and the advancement of learning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the sake of good administration, sound economy, and the\r\nadvancement of science, the Census Office as now constituted should be\r\nmade a permanent government bureau. This would insure better, cheaper,\r\nand more satisfactory work, in the interest not only of our business\r\nbut of statistic, economic, and social science.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe remarkable growth of the postal service is shown in the fact\r\nthat its revenues have doubled and its expenditures have nearly\r\ndoubled within twelve years. Its progressive development compels\r\nconstantly increasing outlay, but in this period of business energy\r\nand prosperity its receipts grow so much faster than its expenses\r\nthat the annual deficit has been steadily reduced from $11,411,779 in\r\n1897 to $3,923,727 in 1901. Among recent postal advances the success\r\nof rural free-delivery wherever established has been so marked, and\r\nactual experience has made its benefits so plain, that the demand for\r\nits extension is general and urgent.\r\n\r\nIt is just that the great agricultural population should share in\r\nthe improvement of the service. The number of rural routes now in\r\noperation is 6,009, practically all established within three years,\r\nand there are 6,000 applications awaiting action. It is expected\r\nthat the number in operation at the close of the current fiscal year\r\nwill reach 8,600. The mail will then be daily carried to the doors\r\nof 5,700,000 of our people who have heretofore been dependent upon\r\ndistant offices, and one-third of all that portion of the country\r\nwhich is adapted to it will be covered by this kind of service.\r\n\r\nThe full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long\r\nbeen hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the\r\nGovernment through the intrenched and well-understood abuses which\r\nhave grown up in connection with second-class mail matter. The extent\r\nof this burden appears when it is stated that while the second-class\r\nmatter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight of all the mail, it\r\npaid for the last fiscal year only $4,294,445 of the aggregate postal\r\nrevenue of $111,631,193. If the pound rate of postage, which produces\r\nthe large loss thus entailed, and which was fixed by the Congress with\r\nthe purpose of encouraging the dissemination of public information,\r\nwere limited to the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually\r\ncontemplated by the law, no just exception could be taken. That\r\nexpense would be the recognized and accepted cost of a liberal public\r\npolicy deliberately adopted for a justifiable end. But much of the\r\nmatter which enjoys the privileged rate is wholly outside of the\r\nintent of the law, and has secured admission only through an evasion\r\nof its requirements or through lax construction. The proportion of\r\nsuch wrongly included matter is estimated by postal experts to be\r\none-half of the whole volume of second-class mail. If it be only\r\none-third or one-quarter, the magnitude of the burden is apparent. The\r\nPost-Office Department has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far\r\nas is possible by a stricter application of the law; and it should be\r\nsustained in its effort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOwing to the rapid growth of our power and our interests on the\r\nPacific, whatever happens in China must be of the keenest national\r\nconcern to us.\r\n\r\nThe general terms of the settlement of the questions growing out of\r\nthe anti-foreign uprisings in China of 1900, having been formulated\r\nin a joint note addressed to China by the representatives of the\r\ninjured powers in December last, were promptly accepted by the Chinese\r\nGovernment. After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the\r\nseveral powers were able to sign a final protocol with the Chinese\r\nplenipotentiaries on the 7th of last September, setting forth the\r\nmeasures taken by China in compliance with the demands of the joint\r\nnote, and expressing their satisfaction therewith. It will be laid\r\nbefore the Congress, with a report of the plenipotentiary on behalf of\r\nthe United States, Mr. William Woodville Rockhill, to whom high praise\r\nis due for the tact, good judgment, and energy he has displayed in\r\nperforming an exceptionally difficult and delicate task.\r\n\r\nThe agreement reached disposes in a manner satisfactory to the powers\r\nof the various grounds of complaint, and will contribute materially to\r\nbetter future relations between China and the powers. Reparation has\r\nbeen made by China for the murder of foreigners during the uprising\r\nand punishment has been inflicted on the officials, however high in\r\nrank, recognized as responsible for or having participated in the\r\noutbreak. Official examinations have been forbidden for a period of\r\nfive years in all cities in which foreigners have been murdered or\r\ncruelly treated, and edicts have been issued making all officials\r\ndirectly responsible for the future safety of foreigners and for the\r\nsuppression of violence against them.\r\n\r\nProvisions have been made for ensuring the future safety of the\r\nforeign representatives in Pekin by setting aside for their exclusive\r\nuse a quarter of the city which the powers can make defensible and\r\nin which they can if necessary maintain permanent military guards;\r\nby dismantling the military works between the capital and the sea;\r\nand by allowing the temporary maintenance of foreign military posts\r\nalong this line. An edict has been issued by the Emperor of China\r\nprohibiting for two years the importation of arms and ammunition into\r\nChina. China has agreed to pay adequate indemnities to the states,\r\nsocieties, and individuals for the losses sustained by them and for\r\nthe expenses of the military expeditions sent by the various powers to\r\nprotect life and restore order.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the joint note of December, 1900, China has\r\nagreed to revise the treaties of commerce and navigation and to take\r\nsuch other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the\r\nforeign powers may decide to be needed.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government has agreed to participate financially in the\r\nwork of bettering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tien-tsin,\r\nthe centres of foreign trade in central and northern China, and an\r\ninternational conservancy board, in which the Chinese Government is\r\nlargely represented, has been provided for the improvement of the\r\nShanghai River and the control of its navigation. In the same line\r\nof commercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on imports\r\nhas been assented to for the purpose of substituting specific for _ad\r\nvalorem_ duties, and an expert has been sent abroad on the part of the\r\nUnited States to assist in this work. A list of articles to remain\r\nfree of duty, including flour, cereals, and rice, gold and silver coin\r\nand bullion, has also been agreed upon in the settlement.\r\n\r\nDuring these troubles our Government has unswervingly advocated\r\nmoderation, and has materially aided in bringing about an adjustment\r\nwhich tends to enhance the welfare of China and to lead to a more\r\nbeneficial intercourse between the Empire and the modern world; while\r\nin the critical period of revolt and massacre we did our full share\r\nin safeguarding life and property, restoring order, and vindicating\r\nthe national interest and honor. It behooves us to continue in these\r\npaths, doing what lies in our power to foster feelings of good will,\r\nand leaving no effort untried to work out the great policy of full\r\nand fair intercourse between China and the nations, on a footing\r\nof equal rights and advantages to all. We advocate the “open door”\r\nwith all that it implies; not merely the procurement of enlarged\r\ncommercial opportunities on the coasts, but access to the interior by\r\nthe waterways with which China has been so extraordinarily favored.\r\nOnly by bringing the people of China into peaceful and friendly\r\ncommunity of trade with all the peoples of the earth can the work\r\nnow auspiciously begun be carried to fruition. In the attainment of\r\nthis purpose we necessarily claim parity of treatment, under the\r\nconventions, throughout the Empire for our trade and our citizens with\r\nthose of all other powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe view with lively interest and keen hopes of beneficial results the\r\nproceedings of the Pan-American Congress, convoked at the invitation\r\nof Mexico, and now sitting at the Mexican capital. The delegates\r\nof the United States are under the most liberal instructions to\r\nco-operate with their colleagues in all matters promising advantage\r\nto the great family of American commonwealths, as well in their\r\nrelations among themselves as in their domestic advancement and in\r\ntheir intercourse with the world at large.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor communicated to the Congress the fact that the Weil and\r\nLa Abra awards against Mexico have been adjudged by the highest courts\r\nof our country to have been obtained through fraud and perjury on the\r\npart of the claimants, and that in accordance with the acts of the\r\nCongress the money remaining in the hands of the Secretary of State\r\non these awards has been returned to Mexico. A considerable portion\r\nof the money received from Mexico on these awards had been paid by\r\nthis Government to the claimants before the decision of the courts was\r\nrendered. My judgment is that the Congress should return to Mexico an\r\namount equal to the sums thus already paid to the claimants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe death of Queen Victoria caused the people of the United States\r\ndeep and heartfelt sorrow, to which the Government gave full\r\nexpression. When President McKinley died, our nation in turn received\r\nfrom every quarter of the British Empire expressions of grief and\r\nsympathy no less sincere. The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick\r\nof Germany also aroused the genuine sympathy of the American people;\r\nand this sympathy was cordially reciprocated by Germany when the\r\nPresident was assassinated. Indeed, from every quarter of the\r\ncivilized world we received, at the time of the President’s death,\r\nassurances of such grief and regard as to touch the hearts of our\r\npeople. In the midst of our affliction we reverently thank the\r\nAlmighty that we are at peace with the nations of mankind; and we\r\nfirmly intend that our policy shall be such as to continue unbroken\r\nthese international relations of mutual respect and good will.\r\n\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n    WHITE HOUSE,\r\n  _December 3, 1901_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, COMMUNICATED TO THE\r\nTWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SESSION OF THE\r\nFIFTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nWe still continue in a period of unbounded prosperity. This prosperity\r\nis not the creature of law, but undoubtedly the laws under which we\r\nwork have been instrumental in creating the conditions which made\r\nit possible, and by unwise legislation it would be easy enough to\r\ndestroy it. There will undoubtedly be periods of depression. The wave\r\nwill recede; but the tide will advance. This nation is seated on a\r\ncontinent flanked by two great oceans. It is composed of men the\r\ndescendants of pioneers, or, in a sense, pioneers themselves; of men\r\nwinnowed out from among the nations of the Old World by the energy,\r\nboldness, and love of adventure found in their own eager hearts. Such\r\na nation, so placed, will surely wrest success from fortune.\r\n\r\nAs a people we have played a large part in the world, and we are bent\r\nupon making our future even larger than the past. In particular, the\r\nevents of the last four years have definitely decided that, for woe\r\nor for weal, our place must be great among the nations. We may either\r\nfail greatly or succeed greatly; but we can not avoid the endeavor\r\nfrom which either great failure or great success must come. Even if\r\nwe would, we can not play a small part. If we should try, all that\r\nwould follow would be that we should play a large part ignobly and\r\nshamefully.\r\n\r\nBut our people, the sons of the men of the Civil War, the sons of\r\nthe men who had iron in their blood, rejoice in the present and face\r\nthe future high of heart and resolute of will. Ours is not the creed\r\nof the weakling and the coward; ours is the gospel of hope and of\r\ntriumphant endeavor. We do not shrink from the struggle before us.\r\nThere are many problems for us to face at the outset of the twentieth\r\ncentury—grave problems abroad and still graver at home; but we know\r\nthat we can solve them and solve them well, provided only that we\r\nbring to the solution the qualities of head and heart which were shown\r\nby the men who, in the days of Washington, founded this government,\r\nand, in the days of Lincoln, preserved it.\r\n\r\nNo country has ever occupied a higher plane of material well-being\r\nthan ours at the present moment. This well-being is due to no\r\nsudden or accidental causes, but to the play of the economic forces\r\nin this country for over a century; to our laws, our sustained and\r\ncontinuous policies; above all, to the high individual average of our\r\ncitizenship. Great fortunes have been won by those who have taken the\r\nlead in this phenomenal industrial development, and most of these\r\nfortunes have been won, not by doing evil, but as an incident to\r\naction which has benefited the community as a whole. Never before\r\nhas material well-being been so widely diffused among our people.\r\nGreat fortunes have been accumulated, and yet in the aggregate these\r\nfortunes are small indeed when compared to the wealth of the people\r\nas a whole. The plain people are better off than they have ever been\r\nbefore. The insurance companies, which are practically mutual benefit\r\nsocieties—especially helpful to men of moderate means—represent\r\naccumulations of capital which are among the largest in this country.\r\nThere are more deposits in the savings banks, more owners of farms,\r\nmore well-paid wage-workers in this country now than ever before in\r\nour history. Of course, when the conditions have favored the growth\r\nof so much that was good, they have also favored somewhat the growth\r\nof what was evil. It is eminently necessary that we should endeavor\r\nto cut out this evil, but let us keep a due sense of proportion; let\r\nus not in fixing our gaze upon the lesser evil forget the greater\r\ngood. The evils are real and some of them are menacing, but they are\r\nthe outgrowth, not of misery or decadence, but of prosperity—of the\r\nprogress of our gigantic industrial development. This industrial\r\ndevelopment must not be checked, but side by side with it should go\r\nsuch progressive regulation as will diminish the evils. We should\r\nfail in our duty if we did not try to remedy the evils, but we shall\r\nsucceed only if we proceed patiently, with practical common-sense as\r\nwell as resolution, separating the good from the bad and holding on to\r\nthe former while endeavoring to get rid of the latter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my Message to the present Congress at its first session I discussed\r\nat length the question of the regulation of those big corporations\r\ncommonly doing an interstate business, often with some tendency to\r\nmonopoly, which are popularly known as trusts. The experience of the\r\npast year has emphasized, in my opinion, the desirability of the steps\r\nI then proposed. A fundamental requisite of social efficiency is a\r\nhigh standard of individual energy and excellence; but this is in no\r\nwise inconsistent with power to act in combination for aims which can\r\nnot so well be achieved by the individual acting alone. A fundamental\r\nbase of civilization is the inviolability of property; but this is\r\nin no wise inconsistent with the right of society to regulate the\r\nexercise of the artificial powers which it confers upon the owners of\r\nproperty, under the name of corporate franchises, in such a way as\r\nto prevent the misuse of these powers. Corporations, and especially\r\ncombinations of corporations, should be managed under public\r\nregulation. Experience has shown that under our system of government\r\nthe necessary supervision can not be obtained by State action. It\r\nmust therefore be achieved by national action. Our aim is not to do\r\naway with corporations; on the contrary, these big aggregations are\r\nan inevitable development of modern industrialism, and the effort to\r\ndestroy them would be futile unless accomplished in ways that would\r\nwork the utmost mischief to the entire body politic. We can do nothing\r\nof good in the way of regulating and supervising these corporations\r\nuntil we fix clearly in our minds that we are not attacking the\r\ncorporations, but endeavoring to do away with any evil in them. We\r\nare not hostile to them; we are merely determined that they shall be\r\nso handled as to subserve the public good. We draw the line against\r\nmisconduct, not against wealth. The capitalist who, alone or in\r\nconjunction with his fellows, performs some great industrial feat by\r\nwhich he wins money is a welldoer, not a wrongdoer, provided only he\r\nworks in proper and legitimate lines. We wish to favor such a man\r\nwhen he does well. We wish to supervise and control his actions only\r\nto prevent him from doing ill. Publicity can do no harm to the honest\r\ncorporation; and we need not be overtender about sparing the dishonest\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\nIn curbing and regulating the combinations of capital which are or\r\nmay become injurious to the public we must be careful not to stop\r\nthe great enterprises which have legitimately reduced the cost of\r\nproduction, not to abandon the place which our country has won in\r\nthe leadership of the international industrial world, not to strike\r\ndown wealth with the result of closing factories and mines, of turning\r\nthe wage-worker idle in the streets and leaving the farmer without a\r\nmarket for what he grows. Insistence upon the impossible means delay\r\nin achieving the possible, exactly as, on the other hand, the stubborn\r\ndefence alike of what is good and what is bad in the existing system,\r\nthe resolute effort to obstruct any attempt at betterment, betrays\r\nblindness to the historic truth that wise evolution is the sure\r\nsafeguard against revolution.\r\n\r\nNo more important subject can come before the Congress than this of\r\nthe regulation of interstate business. This country can not afford to\r\nsit supine on the plea that under our peculiar system of government\r\nwe are helpless in the presence of the new conditions, and unable\r\nto grapple with them or to cut out whatever of evil has arisen in\r\nconnection with them. The power of the Congress to regulate interstate\r\ncommerce is an absolute and unqualified grant, and without limitations\r\nother than those prescribed by the Constitution. The Congress has\r\nconstituted authority to make all laws necessary and proper for\r\nexecuting this power, and I am satisfied that this power has not been\r\nexhausted by any legislation now on the statute books. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that evils restrictive of commercial freedom and entailing\r\nrestraint upon national commerce fall within the regulative power of\r\nthe Congress, and that a wise and reasonable law would be a necessary\r\nand proper exercise of Congressional authority to the end that such\r\nevils should be eradicated.\r\n\r\nI believe that monopolies, unjust discriminations, which prevent or\r\ncripple competition, fraudulent overcapitalization, and other evils in\r\ntrust organizations and practices which injuriously affect interstate\r\ntrade can be prevented under the power of the Congress to “regulate\r\ncommerce with foreign nations and among the several States” through\r\nregulations and requirements operating directly upon such commerce,\r\nthe instrumentalities thereof, and those engaged therein.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend this subject to the consideration of the\r\nCongress with a view to the passage of a law reasonable in its\r\nprovisions and effective in its operations, upon which the questions\r\ncan be finally adjudicated that now raise doubts as to the necessity\r\nof constitutional amendment. If it prove impossible to accomplish the\r\npurposes above set forth by such a law, then, assuredly, we should\r\nnot shrink from amending the Constitution so as to secure beyond\r\nperadventure the power sought.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has not heretofore made any appropriation for the better\r\nenforcement of the anti-trust law as it now stands. Very much has been\r\ndone by the Department of Justice in securing the enforcement of this\r\nlaw, but much more could be done if the Congress would make a special\r\nappropriation for this purpose, to be expended under the direction of\r\nthe Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nOne proposition advocated has been the reduction of the tariff\r\nas a means of reaching the evils of the trusts which fall within\r\nthe category I have described. Not merely would this be wholly\r\nineffective, but the diversion of our efforts in such a direction\r\nwould mean the abandonment of all intelligent attempt to do away with\r\nthese evils. Many of the largest corporations, many of those which\r\nshould certainly be included in any proper scheme of regulation,\r\nwould not be affected in the slightest degree by a change in the\r\ntariff, save as such change interfered with the general prosperity\r\nof the country. The only relation of the tariff to big corporations\r\nas a whole is that the tariff makes manufactures profitable, and\r\nthe tariff remedy proposed would be in effect simply to make\r\nmanufactures unprofitable. To remove the tariff as a punitive\r\nmeasure directed against trusts would inevitably result in ruin to\r\nthe weaker competitors who are struggling against them. Our aim\r\nshould be not by unwise tariff changes to give foreign products the\r\nadvantage over domestic products, but by proper regulation to give\r\ndomestic competition a fair chance; and this end can not be reached\r\nby any tariff changes which would affect unfavorably all domestic\r\ncompetitors, good and bad alike. The question of regulation of the\r\ntrusts stands apart from the question of tariff revision.\r\n\r\nStability of economic policy must always be the prime economic need of\r\nthis country. This stability should not be fossilization. The country\r\nhas acquiesced in the wisdom of the protective tariff principle. It\r\nis exceedingly undesirable that this system should be destroyed or\r\nthat there should be violent and radical changes therein. Our past\r\nexperience shows that great prosperity in this country has always come\r\nunder a protective tariff and that the country can not prosper under\r\nfitful tariff changes at short intervals. Moreover, if the tariff laws\r\nas a whole work well, and if business has prospered under them and is\r\nprospering, it is better to endure for a time slight inconveniences\r\nand inequalities in some schedules than to upset business by too quick\r\nand too radical changes. It is most earnestly to be wished that we\r\ncould treat the tariff from the standpoint solely of our business\r\nneeds. It is, perhaps, too much to hope that partisanship may be\r\nentirely excluded from consideration of the subject, but at least it\r\ncan be made secondary to the business interests of the country—that\r\nis, to the interests of our people as a whole. Unquestionably these\r\nbusiness interests will best be served if together with fixity of\r\nprinciple as regards the tariff we combine a system which will permit\r\nus from time to time to make the necessary reapplication of the\r\nprinciple to the shifting national needs. We must take scrupulous care\r\nthat the reapplication shall be made in such a way that it will not\r\namount to a dislocation of our system, the mere threat of which (not\r\nto speak of the performance) would produce paralysis in the business\r\nenergies of the community. The first consideration in making these\r\nchanges would, of course, be to preserve the principle which underlies\r\nour whole tariff system—that is, the principle of putting American\r\nbusiness interests at least on a full equality with interests abroad,\r\nand of always allowing a sufficient rate of duty to more than cover\r\nthe difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well-being\r\nof the wage-worker, like the well-being of the tiller of the soil,\r\nshould be treated as an essential in shaping our whole economic\r\npolicy. There must never be any change which will jeopardize the\r\nstandard of comfort, the standard of wages of the American wage-worker.\r\n\r\nOne way in which the readjustment sought can be reached is by\r\nreciprocity treaties. It is greatly to be desired that such treaties\r\nmay be adopted. They can be used to widen our markets and to give a\r\ngreater field for the activities of our producers on the one hand, and\r\non the other hand to secure in practical shape the lowering of duties\r\nwhen they are no longer needed for protection among our own people,\r\nor when the minimum of damage done may be disregarded for the sake of\r\nthe maximum of good accomplished. If it prove impossible to ratify the\r\npending treaties, and if there seem to be no warrant for the endeavor\r\nto execute others, or to amend the pending treaties so that they can\r\nbe ratified, then the same end—to secure reciprocity—should be met by\r\ndirect legislation.\r\n\r\nWherever the tariff conditions are such that a needed change can not\r\nwith advantage be made by the application of the reciprocity idea,\r\nthen it can be made outright by a lowering of duties on a given\r\nproduct. If possible, such change should be made only after the\r\nfullest consideration by practical experts, who should approach the\r\nsubject from a business standpoint, having in view both the particular\r\ninterests affected and the commercial well-being of the people as a\r\nwhole. The machinery for providing such careful investigation can\r\nreadily be supplied. The executive department has already at its\r\ndisposal methods of collecting facts and figures; and if the Congress\r\ndesires additional consideration to that which will be given the\r\nsubject by its own committees, then a commission of business experts\r\ncan be appointed whose duty it should be to recommend action by the\r\nCongress after a deliberate and scientific examination of the various\r\nschedules as they are affected by the changed and changing conditions.\r\nThe unhurried and unbiased report of this commission would show what\r\nchanges should be made in the various schedules, and how far these\r\nchanges could go without also changing the great prosperity which this\r\ncountry is now enjoying, or upsetting its fixed economic policy.\r\n\r\nThe cases in which the tariff can produce a monopoly are so few as to\r\nconstitute an inconsiderable factor in the question; but of course\r\nif in any case it be found that a given rate of duty does promote\r\na monopoly which works ill, no protectionist would object to such\r\nreduction of the duty as would equalize competition.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, the tariff on anthracite coal should be removed, and\r\nanthracite put actually, where it now is nominally, on the free list.\r\nThis would have no effect at all save in crises; but in crises it\r\nmight be of service to the people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInterest rates are a potent factor in business activity, and in\r\norder that these rates may be equalized to meet the varying needs\r\nof the seasons and of widely separated communities, and to prevent\r\nthe recurrence of financial stringencies which injuriously affect\r\nlegitimate business, it is necessary that there should be an element\r\nof elasticity in our monetary system. Banks are the natural servants\r\nof commerce, and upon them should be placed, as far as practicable,\r\nthe burden of furnishing and maintaining a circulation adequate to\r\nsupply the needs of our diversified industries and of our domestic\r\nand foreign commerce; and the issue of this should be so regulated\r\nthat a sufficient supply should be always available for the business\r\ninterests of the country.\r\n\r\nIt would be both unwise and unnecessary at this time to attempt to\r\nreconstruct our financial system, which has been the growth of a\r\ncentury; but some additional legislation is, I think, desirable.\r\nThe mere outline of any plan sufficiently comprehensive to meet\r\nthese requirements would transgress the appropriate limits of this\r\ncommunication. It is suggested, however, that all future legislation\r\non the subject should be with the view of encouraging the use of such\r\ninstrumentalities as will automatically supply every legitimate demand\r\nof productive industries and of commerce, not only in the amount,\r\nbut in the character of circulation; and of making all kinds of money\r\ninterchangeable, and, at the will of the holder, convertible into the\r\nestablished gold standard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI again call your attention to the need of passing a proper\r\nimmigration law, covering the points outlined in my Message to you at\r\nthe first session of the present Congress; substantially such a bill\r\nhas already passed the House.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow to secure fair treatment alike for labor and for capital, how to\r\nhold in check the unscrupulous man, whether employer or employee,\r\nwithout weakening individual initiative, without hampering and\r\ncramping the industrial development of the country, is a problem\r\nfraught with great difficulties and one which it is of the highest\r\nimportance to solve on lines of sanity and far-sighted common-sense\r\nas well as of devotion to the right. This is an era of federation\r\nand combination. Exactly as business men find they must often work\r\nthrough corporations, and as it is a constant tendency of these\r\ncorporations to grow larger, so it is often necessary for laboring\r\nmen to work in federations, and these have become important factors\r\nof modern industrial life. Both kinds of federation, capitalistic and\r\nlabor, can do much good, and as a necessary corollary they can both do\r\nevil. Opposition to each kind of organization should take the form of\r\nopposition to whatever is bad in the conduct of any given corporation\r\nor union—not of attacks upon corporations as such nor upon unions as\r\nsuch; for some of the most far-reaching beneficent work for our people\r\nhas been accomplished through both corporations and unions. Each must\r\nrefrain from arbitrary or tyrannous interference with the rights of\r\nothers. Organized capital and organized labor alike should remember\r\nthat in the long run the interest of each must be brought into harmony\r\nwith the interest of the general public; and the conduct of each\r\nmust conform to the fundamental rules of obedience to the law, of\r\nindividual freedom, and of justice and fair dealing toward all. Each\r\nshould remember that in addition to power it must strive after the\r\nrealization of healthy, lofty, and generous ideals. Every employer,\r\never wage-worker, must be guaranteed his liberty and his right to do\r\nas he likes with his property or his labor so long as he does not\r\ninfringe upon the rights of others. It is of the highest importance\r\nthat employer and employee alike should endeavor to appreciate each\r\nthe viewpoint of the other and the sure disaster that will come upon\r\nboth in the long run if either grows to take as habitual an attitude\r\nof sour hostility and distrust toward the other. Few people deserve\r\nbetter of the country than those representatives both of capital and\r\nlabor—and there are many such—who work continually to bring about a\r\ngood understanding of this kind, based upon wisdom and upon broad\r\nand kindly sympathy between employers and employed. Above all, we\r\nneed to remember that any kind of class animosity in the political\r\nworld is, if possible, even more wicked, even more destructive to\r\nnational welfare, than sectional, race, or religious animosity. We\r\ncan get good government only upon condition that we keep true to the\r\nprinciples upon which this Nation was founded, and judge each man not\r\nas a part of a class, but upon his individual merits. All that we\r\nhave a right to ask of any man, rich or poor, whatever his creed, his\r\noccupation, his birthplace, or his residence, is that he shall act\r\nwell and honorably by his neighbor and by his country. We are neither\r\nfor the rich man as such nor for the poor man as such; we are for the\r\nupright man, rich or poor. So far as the constitutional powers of the\r\nNational Government touch these matters of general and vital moment to\r\nthe Nation, they should be exercised in conformity with the principles\r\nabove set forth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is earnestly hoped that a secretary of commerce may be created,\r\nwith a seat in the Cabinet. The rapid multiplication of questions\r\naffecting labor and capital, the growth and complexity of the\r\norganizations through which both labor and capital now find\r\nexpression, the steady tendency toward the employment of capital in\r\nhuge corporations, and the wonderful strides of this country toward\r\nleadership in the international business world justify an urgent\r\ndemand for the creation of such a position. Substantially all the\r\nleading commercial bodies in this country have united in requesting\r\nits creation. It is desirable that some such measure as that which\r\nhas already passed the Senate be enacted into law. The creation\r\nof such a department would in itself be an advance toward dealing\r\nwith and exercising supervision over the whole subject of the great\r\ncorporations doing an interstate business; and with this end in view,\r\nthe Congress should endow the department with large powers, which\r\ncould be increased as experience might show the need.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hope soon to submit to the Senate a reciprocity treaty with Cuba.\r\nOn May 20 last the United States kept its promise to the island by\r\nformally vacating Cuban soil and turning Cuba over to those whom her\r\nown people had chosen as the first officials of the new republic.\r\n\r\nCuba lies at our doors, and whatever affects her for good or for ill\r\naffects us also. So much have our people felt this that in the Platt\r\nAmendment we definitely took the ground that Cuba must hereafter have\r\ncloser political relations with us than with any other power. Thus in\r\na sense Cuba has become a part of our international political system.\r\nThis makes it necessary that in return she should be given some of the\r\nbenefits of becoming part of our economic system. It is, from our own\r\nstandpoint, a shortsighted and mischievous policy to fail to recognize\r\nthis need. Moreover, it is unworthy of a mighty and generous nation,\r\nitself the greatest and most successful republic in history, to refuse\r\nto stretch out a helping hand to a young and weak sister republic just\r\nentering upon its career of independence. We should always fearlessly\r\ninsist upon our rights in the face of the strong, and we should with\r\nungrudging hand do our generous duty by the weak. I urge the adoption\r\nof reciprocity with Cuba not only because it is eminently for our own\r\ninterests to control the Cuban market and by every means to foster\r\nour supremacy in the tropical lands and waters south of us, but also\r\nbecause we, of the giant republic of the north, should make all our\r\nsister nations of the American Continent feel that whenever they will\r\npermit it we desire to show ourselves disinterestedly and effectively\r\ntheir friend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA convention with Great Britain has been concluded, which will be at\r\nonce laid before the Senate for ratification, providing for reciprocal\r\ntrade arrangements between the United States and Newfoundland on\r\nsubstantially the lines of the convention formerly negotiated by the\r\nSecretary of State, Mr. Blaine. I believe reciprocal trade relations\r\nwill be greatly to the advantage of both countries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs civilization grows warfare becomes less and less the normal\r\ncondition of foreign relations. The last century has seen a marked\r\ndiminution of wars between civilized powers; wars with uncivilized\r\npowers are largely mere matters of international police duty,\r\nessential for the welfare of the world. Wherever possible, arbitration\r\nor some similar method should be employed in lieu of war to settle\r\ndifficulties between civilized nations, although as yet the world\r\nhas not progressed sufficiently to render it possible, or necessarily\r\ndesirable, to invoke arbitration in every case. The formation of the\r\ninternational tribunal which sits at The Hague is an event of good\r\nomen from which great consequences for the welfare of all mankind may\r\nflow. It is far better, where possible, to invoke such a permanent\r\ntribunal than to create special arbitrators for a given purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of sincere congratulation to our country that the\r\nUnited States and Mexico should have been the first to use the good\r\noffices of The Hague Court. This was done last summer with most\r\nsatisfactory results in the case of a claim at issue between us and\r\nour sister republic. It is earnestly to be hoped that this first case\r\nwill serve as a precedent for others, in which not only the United\r\nStates but foreign nations may take advantage of the machinery already\r\nin existence at The Hague.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI commend to the favorable consideration of the Congress the Hawaiian\r\nfire claims, which were the subject of careful investigation during\r\nthe last session.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Congress has wisely provided that we shall build at once an\r\nIsthmian Canal, if possible at Panama. The Attorney-General reports\r\nthat we can undoubtedly acquire good title from the French Panama\r\nCanal Company. Negotiations are now pending with Colombia to secure\r\nher assent to our building the canal. This canal will be one of\r\nthe greatest engineering feats of the twentieth century; a greater\r\nengineering feat than has yet been accomplished during the history\r\nof mankind. The work should be carried out as a continuing policy\r\nwithout regard to change of Administration; and it should be begun\r\nunder circumstances which will make it a matter of pride for all\r\nAdministrations to continue the policy.\r\n\r\nThe canal will be of great benefit to America, and of importance to\r\nall the world. It will be of advantage to us industrially and also\r\nas improving our military position. It will be of advantage to the\r\ncountries of tropical America. It is earnestly to be hoped that all\r\nof these countries will do as some of them have already done with\r\nsignal success, and will invite to their shores commerce and improve\r\ntheir material conditions by recognizing that stability and order are\r\nthe prerequisites of successful development. No independent nation in\r\nAmerica need have the slightest fear of aggression from the United\r\nStates. It behooves each one to maintain order within its own borders\r\nand to discharge its just obligations to foreigners. When this is done\r\nthey can rest assured that, be they strong or weak, they have nothing\r\nto dread from outside interference. More and more the increasing\r\ninterdependence and complexity of international, political, and\r\neconomic relations render it incumbent on all civilized and orderly\r\npowers to insist on the proper policing of the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the fall of 1901 a communication was addressed to the Secretary\r\nof State, asking whether permission would be granted by the President\r\nto a corporation to lay a cable from a point on the California coast\r\nto the Philippine Islands by way of Hawaii. A statement of conditions\r\nor terms upon which such corporation would undertake to lay and\r\noperate a cable was volunteered.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the Congress was shortly to convene, and Pacific cable\r\nlegislation had been the subject of consideration by the Congress\r\nfor several years, it seemed to me wise to defer action upon the\r\napplication until the Congress had first an opportunity to act. The\r\nCongress adjourned without taking any action, leaving the matter\r\nin exactly the same condition in which it stood when the Congress\r\nconvened.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it appears that the Commercial Pacific Cable Company had\r\npromptly proceeded with preparations for laying its cable. It also\r\nmade application to the President for access to and use of soundings\r\ntaken by the U. S. S. _Nero_, for the purpose of discovering a\r\npracticable route for a trans-Pacific cable, the company urging that\r\nwith access to these soundings it could complete its cable much sooner\r\nthan if it were required to take soundings upon its own account.\r\nPending consideration of this subject, it appeared important and\r\ndesirable to attach certain conditions to the permission to examine\r\nand use the soundings, if it should be granted.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this solicitation of the cable company, certain\r\nconditions were formulated, upon which the President was willing to\r\nallow access to these soundings and to consent to the landing and\r\nlaying of the cable, subject to any alterations or additions thereto\r\nimposed by the Congress. This was deemed proper, especially as it\r\nwas clear that a cable connection of some kind with China, a foreign\r\ncountry, was a part of the company’s plan. This course was, moreover,\r\nin accordance with a line of precedents, including President Grant’s\r\naction in the case of the first French cable, explained to the\r\nCongress in his Annual Message of December, 1875, and the instance\r\noccurring in 1879 of the second French cable from Brest to St. Pierre,\r\nwith a branch to Cape Cod.\r\n\r\nThese conditions prescribed, among other things, a maximum rate for\r\ncommercial messages and that the company should construct a line from\r\nthe Philippine Islands to China, there being at present, as is well\r\nknown, a British line from Manila to Hongkong.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the cable company kept these conditions long\r\nunder consideration, continuing, in the meantime, to prepare for\r\nlaying the cable. They have, however, at length acceded to them, and\r\nan all-American line between our Pacific coast and the Chinese Empire,\r\nby way of Honolulu and the Philippine Islands, is thus provided for,\r\nand is expected within a few months to be ready for business.\r\n\r\nAmong the conditions is one reserving the power of the Congress to\r\nmodify or repeal any or all of them. A copy of the conditions is\r\nherewith transmitted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf Porto Rico it is only necessary to say that the prosperity of the\r\nisland and the wisdom with which it has been governed have been such\r\nas to make it serve as an example of all that is best in insular\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn July 4 last, on the one hundred and twenty-sixth anniversary\r\nof the declaration of our independence, peace and amnesty were\r\npromulgated in the Philippine Islands. Some trouble has since from\r\ntime to time threatened with the Mohammedan Moros, but with the\r\nlate insurrectionary Filipinos the war has entirely ceased. Civil\r\ngovernment has now been introduced. Not only does each Filipino enjoy\r\nsuch rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as he has\r\nnever before known during the recorded history of the islands, but\r\nthe people taken as a whole now enjoy a measure of self-government\r\ngreater than that granted to any other Orientals by any foreign power\r\nand greater than that enjoyed by any other Orientals under their own\r\ngovernments, save the Japanese alone. We have not gone too far in\r\ngranting these rights of liberty and self-government; but we have\r\ncertainly gone to the limit that in the interests of the Philippine\r\npeople themselves it was wise or just to go. To hurry matters, to go\r\nfaster than we are now going, would entail calamity on the people of\r\nthe islands. No policy ever entered into by the American people has\r\nvindicated itself in more signal manner than the policy of holding\r\nthe Philippines. The triumph of our arms, above all the triumph of\r\nour laws and principles, has come sooner than we had any right to\r\nexpect. Too much praise can not be given to the army for what it has\r\ndone in the Philippines both in warfare and from an administrative\r\nstandpoint in preparing the way for civil government; and similar\r\ncredit belongs to the civil authorities for the way in which they have\r\nplanted the seeds of self-government in the ground thus made ready\r\nfor them. The courage, the unflinching endurance, the high soldierly\r\nefficiency, and the general kind-heartedness and humanity of our\r\ntroops have been strikingly manifested. There now remain only some\r\nfifteen thousand troops in the islands. All told, over one hundred\r\nthousand have been sent there. Of course, there have been individual\r\ninstances of wrongdoing among them. They warred under fearful\r\ndifficulties of climate and surroundings; and under the strain of\r\nthe terrible provocations which they continually received from their\r\nfoes, occasional instances of cruel retaliation occurred. Every effort\r\nhas been made to prevent such cruelties, and finally these efforts\r\nhave been completely successful. Every effort has also been made to\r\ndetect and punish the wrongdoers. After making all allowance for these\r\nmisdeeds, it remains true that few indeed have been the instances in\r\nwhich war has been waged by a civilized power against semi-civilized\r\nor barbarous forces where there has been so little wrongdoing by the\r\nvictors as in the Philippine Islands. On the other hand, the amount\r\nof difficult, important, and beneficent work which has been done is\r\nwellnigh incalculable.\r\n\r\nTaking the work of the army and the civil authorities together, it may\r\nbe questioned whether anywhere else in modern times the world has seen\r\na better example of real constructive statesmanship than our people\r\nhave given in the Philippine Islands. High praise should also be given\r\nthose Filipinos, in the aggregate very numerous, who have accepted the\r\nnew conditions and joined with our representatives to work with hearty\r\ngood-will for the welfare of the islands.\r\n\r\nThe army has been reduced to the minimum allowed by law. It is very\r\nsmall for the size of the nation, and most certainly should be kept at\r\nthe highest point of efficiency. The senior officers are given scant\r\nchance under ordinary conditions to exercise commands commensurate\r\nwith their rank, under circumstances which would fit them to do their\r\nduty in the time of actual war. A system of manœuvring our army in\r\nbodies of some little size has been begun and should be steadily\r\ncontinued. Without such manœuvres it is folly to expect that in the\r\nevent of hostilities with any serious foe even a small army corps\r\ncould be handled to advantage. Both our officers and enlisted men are\r\nsuch that we can take hearty pride in them. No better material can\r\nbe found. But they must be thoroughly trained, both as individuals\r\nand in the mass. The marksmanship of the men must receive special\r\nattention. In the circumstances of modern warfare the man must act far\r\nmore on his own individual responsibility than ever before, and the\r\nhigh individual efficiency of the unit is of the utmost importance.\r\nFormerly this unit was the regiment; it is now not the regiment, not\r\neven the troop or company; it is the individual soldier. Every effort\r\nmust be made to develop every workmanlike and soldierly quality in\r\nboth the officer and the enlisted man.\r\n\r\nI urgently call your attention to the need of passing a bill providing\r\nfor a general staff and for the reorganization of the supply\r\ndepartments on the lines of the bill proposed by the Secretary of War\r\nlast year. When the young officers enter the army from West Point they\r\nprobably stand above their compeers in any other military service.\r\nEvery effort should be made, by training, by reward of merit, by\r\nscrutiny into their careers and capacity, to keep them of the same\r\nhigh relative excellence throughout their careers.\r\n\r\nThe measure providing for the reorganization of the militia system and\r\nfor securing the highest efficiency in the National Guard, which has\r\nalready passed the House, should receive prompt attention and action.\r\nIt is of great importance that the relation of the National Guard\r\nto the militia and volunteer forces of the United States should be\r\ndefined, and that in place of our present obsolete laws a practical\r\nand efficient system should be adopted.\r\n\r\nProvision should be made to enable the Secretary of War to keep\r\ncavalry and artillery horses, worn-out in long performance of duty.\r\nSuch horses fetch but a trifle when sold; and rather than turn them\r\nout to the misery awaiting them when thus disposed of, it would\r\nbe better to employ them at light work around the posts, and when\r\nnecessary to put them painlessly to death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the first time in our history naval manœuvres on a large scale\r\nare being held under the immediate command of the admiral of the\r\nnavy. Constantly increasing attention is being paid to the gunnery\r\nof the navy, but it is yet far from what it should be. I earnestly\r\nurge that the increase asked for by the Secretary of the Navy in the\r\nappropriation for improving the marksmanship be granted. In battle\r\nthe only shots that count are the shots that hit. It is necessary to\r\nprovide ample funds for practice with the great guns in time of peace.\r\nThese funds must provide not only for the purchase of projectiles, but\r\nfor allowances for prizes to encourage the gun crews, and especially\r\nthe gun pointers, and for perfecting an intelligent system under which\r\nalone it is possible to get good practice.\r\n\r\nThere should be no halt in the work of building up the navy, providing\r\nevery year additional fighting craft. We are a very rich country, vast\r\nin extent of territory and great in population; a country, moreover,\r\nwhich has an army diminutive indeed when compared with that of any\r\nother first-class power. We have deliberately made our own certain\r\nforeign policies which demand the possession of a first-class navy.\r\nThe Isthmian Canal will greatly increase the efficiency of our navy\r\nif the navy is of sufficient size; but if we have an inadequate navy,\r\nthen the building of the canal would be merely giving a hostage to\r\nany power of superior strength. The Monroe Doctrine should be treated\r\nas the cardinal feature of American foreign policy; but it would be\r\nworse than idle to assert it unless we intended to back it up, and it\r\ncan be backed up only by a thoroughly good navy. A good navy is not a\r\nprovocative of war. It is the surest guaranty of peace.\r\n\r\nEach individual unit of our navy should be the most efficient of its\r\nkind as regards both material and personnel that is to be found in\r\nthe world. I call your special attention to the need of providing\r\nfor the manning of the ships. Serious trouble threatens us if we can\r\nnot do better than we are now doing as regards securing the services\r\nof a sufficient number of the highest type of sailormen, of sea\r\nmechanics. The veteran seamen of our warships are of as high a type\r\nas can be found in any navy which rides the waters of the world; they\r\nare unsurpassed in daring, in resolution, in readiness, in thorough\r\nknowledge of their profession. They deserve every consideration\r\nthat can be shown them. But there are not enough of them. It is no\r\nmore possible to improvise a crew than it is possible to improvise\r\na warship. To build the finest ship, with the deadliest battery,\r\nand to send it afloat with a raw crew, no matter how brave they were\r\nindividually, would be to insure disaster if a foe of average capacity\r\nwere encountered. Neither ships nor men can be improvised when war has\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nWe need a thousand additional officers in order to properly man the\r\nships now provided for and under construction. The classes at the\r\nnaval school at Annapolis should be greatly enlarged. At the same time\r\nthat we thus add the officers where we need them, we should facilitate\r\nthe retirement of those at the head of the list whose usefulness has\r\nbecome impaired. Promotion must be fostered if the service is to be\r\nkept efficient.\r\n\r\nThe lamentable scarcity of officers, and the large number of recruits\r\nand of unskilled men necessarily put aboard the new vessels as they\r\nhave been commissioned, has thrown upon our officers, and especially\r\non the lieutenants and junior grades, unusual labor and fatigue and\r\nhas gravely strained their powers of endurance. Nor is there sign\r\nof any immediate let-up in this strain. It must continue for some\r\ntime longer, until more officers are graduated from Annapolis, and\r\nuntil the recruits become trained and skilful in their duties. In\r\nthese difficulties incident upon the development of our war fleet\r\nthe conduct of all our officers has been creditable to the service,\r\nand the lieutenants and junior grades in particular have displayed\r\nan ability and a steadfast cheerfulness which entitles them to the\r\nungrudging thanks of all who realize the disheartening trials and\r\nfatigues to which they are of necessity subjected.\r\n\r\nThere is not a cloud on the horizon at present. There seems not the\r\nslightest chance of trouble with a foreign power. We most earnestly\r\nhope that this state of things may continue; and the way to insure\r\nits continuance is to provide for a thoroughly efficient navy. The\r\nrefusal to maintain such a navy would invite trouble, and if trouble\r\ncame would ensure disaster. Fatuous self-complacency or vanity, or\r\nshort-sightedness in refusing to prepare for danger, is both foolish\r\nand wicked in such a nation as ours; and past experience has shown\r\nthat such fatuity in refusing to recognize or prepare for any crisis\r\nin advance is usually succeeded by a mad panic of hysterical fear once\r\nthe crisis has actually arrived.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe striking increase in the revenues of the Post-Office Department\r\nshows clearly the prosperity of our people and the increasing activity\r\nof the business of the country.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Post-Office Department for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30 last amounted to $121,848,047.26, an increase of\r\n$10,216,853.87 over the preceding year, the largest increase known in\r\nthe history of the postal service. The magnitude of this increase will\r\nbest appear from the fact that the entire postal receipts for the year\r\n1860 amounted to but $8,518,067.\r\n\r\nRural free-delivery service is no longer in the experimental stage;\r\nit has become a fixed policy. The results following its introduction\r\nhave fully justified the Congress in the large appropriations made\r\nfor its establishment and extension. The average yearly increase in\r\npost-office receipts in the rural districts of the country is about\r\ntwo per cent. We are now able, by actual results, to show that where\r\nrural free-delivery service has been established to such an extent as\r\nto enable us to make comparisons the yearly increase has been upward\r\nof ten per cent.\r\n\r\nOn November 1, 1902, 11,650 rural free-delivery routes had been\r\nestablished and were in operation, covering about one-third of the\r\nterritory of the United States available for rural free-delivery\r\nservice. There are now awaiting the action of the Department petitions\r\nand applications for the establishment of 10,748 additional routes.\r\nThis shows conclusively the want which the establishment of the\r\nservice has met and the need of further extending it as rapidly as\r\npossible. It is justified both by the financial results and by the\r\npractical benefits to our rural population; it brings the men who live\r\non the soil into close relations with the active business world; it\r\nkeeps the farmer in daily touch with the markets; it is a potential\r\neducational force; it enhances the value of farm property, makes farm\r\nlife far pleasanter and less isolated, and will do much to check the\r\nundesirable current from country to city.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the Congress will make liberal appropriations\r\nfor the continuance of the service already established and for its\r\nfurther extension.\r\n\r\nFew subjects of more importance have been taken up by the Congress in\r\nrecent years than the inauguration of the system of nationally-aided\r\nirrigation for the arid regions of the far West. A good beginning\r\ntherein has been made. Now that this policy of national irrigation has\r\nbeen adopted, the need of thorough and scientific forest protection\r\nwill grow more rapidly than ever throughout the public-land States.\r\n\r\nLegislation should be provided for the protection of the game, and\r\nthe wild creatures generally, on the forest reserves. The senseless\r\nslaughter of game, which can by judicious protection be permanently\r\npreserved on our national reserves for the people as a whole, should\r\nbe stopped at once. It is, for instance, a serious count against our\r\nnational good sense to permit the present practice of butchering off\r\nsuch a stately and beautiful creature as the elk for its antlers or\r\ntusks.\r\n\r\nSo far as they are available for agriculture, and to whatever extent\r\nthey may be reclaimed under the national irrigation law, the remaining\r\npublic lands should be held rigidly for the home builder, the settler\r\nwho lives on his land, and for no one else. In their actual use the\r\ndesert-land law, the timber and stone law, and the commutation clause\r\nof the homestead law have been so perverted from the intention with\r\nwhich they were enacted as to permit the acquisition of large areas of\r\nthe public domain for other than actual settlers and the consequent\r\nprevention of settlement. Moreover, the approaching exhaustion of the\r\npublic ranges has of late led to much discussion as to the best manner\r\nof using these public lands in the West which are suitable chiefly or\r\nonly for grazing. The sound and steady development of the West depends\r\nupon the building up of homes therein. Much of our prosperity as a\r\nnation has been due to the operation of the homestead law. On the\r\nother hand, we should recognize the fact that in the grazing region\r\nthe man who corresponds to the homesteader may be unable to settle\r\npermanently if only allowed to use the same amount of pasture land\r\nthat his brother, the homesteader, is allowed to use of arable land.\r\nOne hundred and sixty acres of fairly rich and well-watered soil, or\r\na much smaller amount of irrigated land, may keep a family in plenty,\r\nwhereas no one could get a living from one hundred and sixty acres of\r\ndry pasture land capable of supporting at the outside only one head\r\nof cattle to every ten acres. In the past great tracts of the public\r\ndomain have been fenced in by persons having no title thereto, in\r\ndirect defiance of the law forbidding the maintenance or construction\r\nof any such unlawful inclosure of public land. For various reasons\r\nthere has been little interference with such inclosures in the past,\r\nbut ample notice has now been given the trespassers, and all the\r\nresources at the command of the Government will hereafter be used to\r\nput a stop to such trespassing.\r\n\r\nIn view of the capital importance of these matters, I commend them to\r\nthe earnest consideration of the Congress, and if the Congress finds\r\ndifficulty in dealing with them from lack of thorough knowledge of\r\nthe subject, I recommend that provision be made for a commission of\r\nexperts specially to investigate and report upon the complicated\r\nquestions involved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI especially urge upon the Congress the need of wise legislation for\r\nAlaska. It is not to our credit as a nation that Alaska, which has\r\nbeen ours for thirty-five years, should still have as poor a system\r\nof laws as is the case. No country has a more valuable possession—in\r\nmineral wealth, in fisheries, furs, forests, and also in land\r\navailable for certain kinds of farming and stock-growing. It is a\r\nterritory of great size and varied resources, well fitted to support\r\na large permanent population. Alaska needs a good land law and such\r\nprovisions for homesteads and pre-emptions as will encourage permanent\r\nsettlement. We should shape legislation with a view not to the\r\nexploiting and abandoning of the territory, but to the building up of\r\nhomes therein. The land laws should be liberal in type, so as to hold\r\nout inducements to the actual settler whom we most desire to see take\r\npossession of the country. The forests of Alaska should be protected,\r\nand, as a secondary but still important matter, the game also, and at\r\nthe same time it is imperative that the settlers should be allowed to\r\ncut timber, under proper regulations, for their own use. Laws should\r\nbe enacted to protect the Alaskan salmon fisheries against the greed\r\nwhich would destroy them. They should be preserved as a permanent\r\nindustry and food supply. Their management and control should be\r\nturned over to the Commission of Fish and Fisheries. Alaska should\r\nhave a Delegate in the Congress. It would be well if a Congressional\r\ncommittee could visit Alaska and investigate its needs on the ground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the Indians our aim should be their ultimate\r\nabsorption into the body of our people. But in many cases this\r\nabsorption must and should be very slow. In portions of the Indian\r\nTerritory the mixture of blood has gone on at the same time with\r\nprogress in wealth and education, so that there are plenty of men\r\nwith varying degrees of purity of Indian blood who are absolutely\r\nindistinguishable in point of social, political, and economic ability\r\nfrom their white associates. There are other tribes which have as yet\r\nmade no perceptible advance toward such equality. To try to force such\r\ntribes too fast is to prevent their going forward at all. Moreover,\r\nthe tribes live under widely different conditions. Where a tribe has\r\nmade considerable advance and lives on fertile farming soil it is\r\npossible to allot the members lands in severalty much as is the case\r\nwith white settlers. There are other tribes where such a course is not\r\ndesirable. On the arid prairie lands the effort should be to induce\r\nthe Indians to lead pastoral rather than agricultural lives, and to\r\npermit them to settle in villages rather than to force them into\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\nThe large Indian schools situated remote from any Indian reservation\r\ndo a special and peculiar work of great importance. But, excellent\r\nthough these are, an immense amount of additional work must be done\r\non the reservations themselves among the old, and above all among the\r\nyoung, Indians.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important step toward the absorption of the Indian\r\nis to teach him to earn his living; yet it is not necessarily to\r\nbe assumed that in each community all Indians must become either\r\ntillers of the soil or stock-raisers. Their industries may properly\r\nbe diversified, and those who show special desire or adaptability for\r\nindustrial or even commercial pursuits should be encouraged so far as\r\npracticable to follow out each his own bent.\r\n\r\nEvery effort should be made to develop the Indian along the lines of\r\nnatural aptitude, and to encourage the existing native industries\r\npeculiar to certain tribes, such as the various kinds of basket\r\nweaving, canoe building, smith work, and blanket work. Above all, the\r\nIndian boys and girls should be given confident command of colloquial\r\nEnglish, and should ordinarily be prepared for a vigorous struggle\r\nwith the conditions under which their people live, rather than for\r\nimmediate absorption into some more highly developed community.\r\n\r\nThe officials who represent the Government in dealing with the Indians\r\nwork under hard conditions, and also under conditions which render\r\nit easy to do wrong and very difficult to detect wrong. Consequently\r\nthey should be amply paid on the one hand, and on the other hand a\r\nparticularly high standard of conduct should be demanded from them,\r\nand where misconduct can be proved the punishment should be exemplary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn no department of governmental work in recent years has there\r\nbeen greater success than in that of giving scientific aid to the\r\nfarming population, thereby showing them how most efficiently to help\r\nthemselves. There is no need of insisting upon its importance, for the\r\nwelfare of the farmer is fundamentally necessary to the welfare of the\r\nRepublic as a whole. In addition to such work as quarantine against\r\nanimal and vegetable plagues, and warring against them when here\r\nintroduced, much efficient help has been rendered to the farmer by the\r\nintroduction of new plants specially fitted for cultivation under the\r\npeculiar conditions existing in different portions of the country. New\r\ncereals have been established in the semi-arid West. For instance,\r\nthe practicability of producing the best types of macaroni wheats in\r\nregions of an annual rainfall of only ten inches or thereabouts has\r\nbeen conclusively demonstrated. Through the introduction of new rices\r\nin Louisiana and Texas the production of rice in this country has been\r\nmade to about equal the home demand. In the Southwest the possibility\r\nof regrassing over-stocked range lands has been demonstrated; in the\r\nNorth many new forage crops have been introduced, while in the East\r\nit has been shown that some of our choicest fruits can be stored and\r\nshipped in such a way as to find a profitable market abroad.\r\n\r\nI again recommend to the favorable consideration of the Congress the\r\nplans of the Smithsonian Institution for making the Museum under\r\nits charge worthy of the Nation, and for preserving at the National\r\nCapital not only records of the vanishing races of men but of the\r\nanimals of this continent which, like the buffalo, will soon become\r\nextinct unless specimens from which their representatives may be\r\nrenewed are sought in their native regions and maintained there in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia is the only part of our territory in which\r\nthe National Government exercises local or municipal functions, and\r\nwhere in consequence the Government has a free hand in reference\r\nto certain types of social and economic legislation which must be\r\nessentially local or municipal in their character. The Government\r\nshould see to it, for instance, that the hygienic and sanitary\r\nlegislation affecting Washington is of a high character. The evils\r\nof slum dwellings, whether in the shape of crowded and congested\r\ntenement-house districts or of the back-alley type, should never be\r\npermitted to grow up in Washington. The city should be a model in\r\nevery respect for all the cities of the country. The charitable and\r\ncorrectional systems of the District should receive consideration\r\nat the hands of the Congress to the end that they may embody the\r\nresults of the most advanced thought in these fields. Moreover, while\r\nWashington is not a great industrial city, there is some industrialism\r\nhere, and our labor legislation, while it would not be important in\r\nitself, might be made a model for the rest of the Nation. We should\r\npass, for instance, a wise employer’s-liability act for the District\r\nof Columbia, and we need such an act in our navy yards. Railroad\r\ncompanies in the District ought to be required by law to block their\r\nfrogs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe safety-appliance law, for the better protection of the lives and\r\nlimbs of railway employees, which was passed in 1893, went into full\r\neffect on August 1, 1901. It has resulted in averting thousands of\r\ncasualties. Experience shows, however, the necessity of additional\r\nlegislation to perfect this law. A bill to provide for this passed the\r\nSenate at the last session. It is to be hoped that some such measure\r\nmay now be enacted into law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a growing tendency to provide for the publication of masses\r\nof documents for which there is no public demand and for the printing\r\nof which there is no real necessity. Large numbers of volumes are\r\nturned out by the Government printing presses for which there is no\r\njustification. Nothing should be printed by any of the Departments\r\nunless it contains something of permanent value, and the Congress\r\ncould with advantage cut down very materially on all the printing\r\nwhich it has now become customary to provide. The excessive cost of\r\nGovernment printing is a strong argument against the position of those\r\nwho are inclined on abstract grounds to advocate the Government’s\r\ndoing any work which can with propriety be left in private hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGratifying progress has been made during the year in the extension of\r\nthe merit system of making appointments in the Government service. It\r\nshould be extended by law to the District of Columbia. It is much to\r\nbe desired that our consular system be established by law on a basis\r\nproviding for appointment and promotion only in consequence of proved\r\nfitness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThrough a wise provision of the Congress at its last session, the\r\nWhite House, which had become disfigured by incongruous additions\r\nand changes, has now been restored to what it was planned to be by\r\nWashington. In making the restorations the utmost care has been\r\nexercised to come as near as possible to the early plans and to\r\nsupplement these plans by a careful study of such buildings as that of\r\nthe University of Virginia, which was built by Jefferson. The White\r\nHouse is the property of the Nation, and so far as is compatible\r\nwith living therein it should be kept as it originally was, for\r\nthe same reasons that we keep Mount Vernon as it originally was.\r\nThe stately simplicity of its architecture is an expression of the\r\ncharacter of the period in which it was built, and is in accord with\r\nthe purposes it was designed to serve. It is a good thing to preserve\r\nsuch buildings as historic monuments which keep alive our sense of\r\ncontinuity with the Nation’s past.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the several Executive Departments are submitted to the\r\nCongress with this communication.\r\n\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n      WHITE HOUSE,\r\n  _December 2, 1902_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, COMMUNICATED TO THE\r\nTWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST SESSION OF THE\r\nFIFTY-EIGHTH CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have convened the Congress that it may consider the legislation\r\nnecessary to put into operation the commercial treaty with Cuba, which\r\nwas ratified by the Senate at its last session, and subsequently by\r\nthe Cuban Government. I deem such legislation demanded not only by\r\nour interest but by our honor. We can not with propriety abandon the\r\ncourse upon which we have so wisely embarked. When the acceptance\r\nof the Platt Amendment was required from Cuba by the action of the\r\nCongress of the United States, this Government thereby definitely\r\ncommitted itself to the policy of treating Cuba as occupying a unique\r\nposition as regards this country. It was provided that when the island\r\nbecame a free and independent republic she should stand in such close\r\nrelations with us as in certain respects to come within our system of\r\ninternational policy; and it necessarily followed that she must also\r\nto a certain degree become included within the lines of our economic\r\npolicy. Situated as Cuba is, it would not be possible for this\r\ncountry to permit the strategic abuse of the island by any foreign\r\nmilitary power. It is for this reason that certain limitations have\r\nbeen imposed upon her financial policy, and that naval stations have\r\nbeen conceded by her to the United States. The negotiations as to the\r\ndetails of these naval stations are on the eve of completion. They are\r\nso situated as to prevent any idea that there is the intention ever to\r\nuse them against Cuba, or otherwise than for the protection of Cuba\r\nfrom the assaults of foreign foes, and for the better safeguarding of\r\nAmerican interests in the waters south of us.\r\n\r\nThese interests have been largely increased by the consequences of the\r\nwar with Spain, and will be still further increased by the building of\r\nthe Isthmian Canal. They are both military and economic. The granting\r\nto us by Cuba of the naval stations above alluded to is of the utmost\r\nimportance from a military standpoint, and is proof of the good faith\r\nwith which Cuba is treating us. Cuba has made great progress since her\r\nindependence was established. She has advanced steadily in every way.\r\nShe already stands high among her sister republics of the New World.\r\nShe is loyally observing her obligations to us; and she is entitled to\r\nlike treatment by us.\r\n\r\nThe treaty submitted to you for approval secures to the United States\r\neconomic advantages as great as those given to Cuba. Not an American\r\ninterest is sacrificed. By the treaty a large Cuban market is secured\r\nto our producers. It is a market which lies at our doors, which is\r\nalready large, which is capable of great expansion, and which is\r\nespecially important to the development of our export trade. It would\r\nbe indeed shortsighted for us to refuse to take advantage of such an\r\nopportunity, and to force Cuba into making arrangements with other\r\ncountries to our disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThis reciprocity treaty stands by itself. It is demanded on\r\nconsiderations of broad national policy as well as by our economic\r\ninterest. It will do harm to no industry. It will benefit many\r\nindustries. It is in the interest of our people as a whole, both\r\nbecause of its importance from the broad standpoint of international\r\npolicy, and because economically it intimately concerns us to develop\r\nand secure the rich Cuban market for our farmers, artisans, merchants,\r\nand manufacturers. Finally, it is desirable as a guaranty of the\r\ngood faith of our Nation toward her young sister republic to the\r\nsouth, whose welfare must ever be closely bound with ours. We gave\r\nher liberty. We are knit to her by the memories of the blood and the\r\ncourage of our soldiers who fought for her in war; by the memory of\r\nthe wisdom and integrity of our administrators who served her in peace\r\nand who started her so well on the difficult path of self-government.\r\nWe must help her onward and upward; and in helping her we shall help\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations caused the negotiations of the treaty\r\nwith Cuba and its ratification by the Senate. They now with equal\r\nforce support the legislation by the Congress which by the terms of\r\nthe treaty is necessary to render it operative. A failure to enact\r\nsuch legislation would come perilously near a repudiation of the\r\npledged faith of the Nation.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the treaty, as amended by the Senate and ratified\r\nby the Cuban Government.\r\n\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n    WHITE HOUSE,\r\n  _November 10, 1903_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, COMMUNICATED TO THE\r\nTWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SESSION OF THE\r\nFIFTY-EIGHTH CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nThe country is to be congratulated on the amount of substantial\r\nachievement which has marked the past year both as regards our foreign\r\nand as regards our domestic policy.\r\n\r\nWith a nation as with a man the most important things are those of the\r\nhousehold, and therefore the country is especially to be congratulated\r\non what has been accomplished in the direction of providing for the\r\nexercise of supervision over the great corporations and combinations\r\nof corporations engaged in interstate commerce. The Congress has\r\ncreated the Department of Commerce and Labor, including the Bureau\r\nof Corporations, with for the first time authority to secure proper\r\npublicity of such proceedings of these great corporations as the\r\npublic has the right to know. It has provided for the expediting\r\nof suits for the enforcement of the Federal anti-trust law; and by\r\nanother law it has secured equal treatment to all producers in the\r\ntransportation of their goods, thus taking a long stride forward in\r\nmaking effective the work of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Department of Commerce and Labor, with\r\nthe Bureau of Corporations thereunder, marks a real advance in the\r\ndirection of doing all that is possible for the solution of the\r\nquestions vitally affecting capitalists and wage-workers. The act\r\ncreating the Department was approved on February 14, 1903, and two\r\ndays later the head of the Department was nominated and confirmed\r\nby the Senate. Since then the work of organization has been pushed\r\nas rapidly as the initial appropriations permitted, and with due\r\nregard to thoroughness and the broad purposes which the Department\r\nis designed to serve. After the transfer of the various bureaus and\r\nbranches to the Department at the beginning of the current fiscal\r\nyear, as provided for in the act, the personnel comprised 1,289\r\nemployees in Washington and 8,836 in the country at large. The scope\r\nof the Department’s duty and authority embraces the commercial and\r\nindustrial interests of the Nation. It is not designed to restrict\r\nor control the fullest liberty of legitimate business action, but to\r\nsecure exact and authentic information which will aid the Executive in\r\nenforcing existing laws, and which will enable the Congress to enact\r\nadditional legislation, if any should be found necessary, in order to\r\nprevent the few from obtaining privileges at the expense of diminished\r\nopportunities for the many.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary work of the Bureau of Corporations in the Department\r\nhas shown the wisdom of its creation. Publicity in corporate affairs\r\nwill tend to do away with ignorance, and will afford facts upon which\r\nintelligent action may be taken. Systematic, intelligent investigation\r\nis already developing facts the knowledge of which is essential to a\r\nright understanding of the needs and duties of the business world. The\r\ncorporation which is honestly and fairly organized, whose managers\r\nin the conduct of its business recognize their obligation to deal\r\nsquarely with their stockholders, their competitors, and the public,\r\nhas nothing to fear from such supervision. The purpose of this Bureau\r\nis not to embarrass or assail legitimate business, but to aid in\r\nbringing about a better industrial condition—a condition under which\r\nthere shall be obedience to law and recognition of public obligation\r\nby all corporations, great or small. The Department of Commerce and\r\nLabor will be not only the clearing house for information regarding\r\nthe business transactions of the Nation but the executive arm of\r\nthe Government to aid in strengthening our domestic and foreign\r\nmarkets, in perfecting our transportation facilities, in building\r\nup our merchant marine, in preventing the entrance of undesirable\r\nimmigrants, in improving commercial and industrial conditions, and\r\nin bringing together on common ground those necessary partners in\r\nindustrial progress—capital and labor. Commerce between the nations is\r\nsteadily growing in volume, and the tendency of the times is toward\r\ncloser trade relations. Constant watchfulness is needed to secure to\r\nAmericans the chance to participate to the best advantage in foreign\r\ntrade; and we may confidently expect that the new Department will\r\njustify the expectation of its creators by the exercise of this\r\nwatchfulness, as well as by the businesslike administration of such\r\nlaws relating to our internal affairs as are intrusted to its care.\r\n\r\nIn enacting the laws above enumerated the Congress proceeded on sane\r\nand conservative lines. Nothing revolutionary was attempted; but\r\na common-sense and successful effort was made in the direction of\r\nseeing that corporations are so handled as to subserve the public\r\ngood. The legislation was moderate. It was characterized throughout by\r\nthe idea that we were not attacking corporations, but endeavoring to\r\nprovide for doing away with any evil in them; that we drew the line\r\nagainst misconduct, not against wealth; gladly recognizing the great\r\ngood done by the capitalist who alone, or in conjunction with his\r\nfellows, does his work along proper and legitimate lines. The purpose\r\nof the legislation, which purpose will undoubtedly be fulfilled, was\r\nto favor such a man when he does well, and to supervise his action\r\nonly to prevent him from doing ill. Publicity can do no harm to the\r\nhonest corporation. The only corporation that has cause to dread\r\nit is the corporation which shrinks from the light, and about the\r\nwelfare of such corporations we need not be oversensitive. The work of\r\nthe Department of Commerce and Labor has been conditioned upon this\r\ntheory, of securing fair treatment alike for labor and for capital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe consistent policy of the National Government, so far as it\r\nhas the power, is to hold in check the unscrupulous man, whether\r\nemployer or employee; but to refuse to weaken individual initiative\r\nor to hamper or cramp the industrial development of the country.\r\nWe recognize that this is an era of federation and combination, in\r\nwhich great capitalistic corporations and labor unions have become\r\nfactors of tremendous importance in all industrial centres. Hearty\r\nrecognition is given the far-reaching, beneficent work which has\r\nbeen accomplished through both corporations and unions, and the line\r\nas between different corporations, as between different unions, is\r\ndrawn as it is between different individuals; that is, it is drawn\r\non conduct, the effort being to treat both organized capital and\r\norganized labor alike, asking nothing save that the interest of each\r\nshall be brought into harmony with the interest of the general public,\r\nand that the conduct of each shall conform to the fundamental rules\r\nof obedience to law, of individual freedom, and of justice and fair\r\ndealing towards all. Whenever either corporation, labor union, or\r\nindividual disregards the law or acts in a spirit of arbitrary and\r\ntyrannous interference with the rights of others, whether corporations\r\nor individuals, then where the Federal Government has jurisdiction,\r\nit will see to it that the misconduct is stopped, paying not the\r\nslightest heed to the position or power of the corporation, the\r\nunion or the individual, but only to one vital fact—that is, the\r\nquestion whether or not the conduct of the individual or aggregate of\r\nindividuals is in accordance with the law of the land. Every man must\r\nbe guaranteed his liberty and his right to do as he likes with his\r\nproperty or his labor, so long as he does not infringe the rights of\r\nothers. No man is above the law and no man is below it; nor do we ask\r\nany man’s permission when we require him to obey it. Obedience to the\r\nlaw is demanded as a right; not asked as a favor.\r\n\r\nWe have cause as a Nation to be thankful for the steps that have\r\nbeen so successfully taken to put these principles into effect. The\r\nprogress has been by evolution, not by revolution. Nothing radical\r\nhas been done; the action has been both moderate and resolute.\r\nTherefore the work will stand. There shall be no backward step. If in\r\nthe working of the laws it proves desirable that they shall at any\r\npoint be expanded or amplified, the amendment can be made as its\r\ndesirability is shown. Meanwhile they are being administered with\r\njudgment, but with insistence upon obedience to them; and their need\r\nhas been emphasized in signal fashion by the events of the past year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom all sources, exclusive of the postal service, the receipts of\r\nthe Government for the last fiscal year aggregated $560,396,674.\r\nThe expenditures for the same period were $506,099,007, the surplus\r\nfor the fiscal year being $54,297,667. The indications are that the\r\nsurplus for the present fiscal year will be very small, if indeed\r\nthere be any surplus. From July to November the receipts from customs\r\nwere, approximately, nine million dollars less than the receipts from\r\nthe same source for a corresponding portion of last year. Should this\r\ndecrease continue at the same ratio throughout the fiscal year, the\r\nsurplus would be reduced by, approximately, thirty million dollars.\r\nShould the revenue from customs suffer much further decrease during\r\nthe fiscal year, the surplus would vanish. A large surplus is\r\ncertainly undesirable. Two years ago the war taxes were taken off\r\nwith the express intention of equalizing the governmental receipts\r\nand expenditures, and though the first year thereafter still showed a\r\nsurplus, it now seems likely that a substantial equality of revenue\r\nand expenditure will be attained. Such being the case it is of great\r\nmoment both to exercise care and economy in appropriations, and\r\nto scan sharply any change in our fiscal revenue system which may\r\nreduce our income. The need of strict economy in our expenditures is\r\nemphasized by the fact that we can not afford to be parsimonious in\r\nproviding for what is essential to our national well-being. Careful\r\neconomy wherever possible will alone prevent our income from falling\r\nbelow the point required in order to meet our genuine needs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe integrity of our currency is beyond question, and under\r\npresent conditions it would be unwise and unnecessary to attempt a\r\nreconstruction of our entire monetary system. The same liberty should\r\nbe granted the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit customs receipts\r\nas is granted him in the deposit of receipts from other sources. In\r\nmy Message of December 2, 1902, I called attention to certain needs\r\nof the financial situation, and I again ask the consideration of the\r\nCongress for these questions.\r\n\r\nDuring the last session of the Congress, at the suggestion of a joint\r\nnote from the Republic of Mexico and the Imperial Government of China,\r\nand in harmony with an act of the Congress appropriating $25,000 to\r\npay the expenses thereof, a commission was appointed to confer with\r\nthe principal European countries in the hope that some plan might be\r\ndevised whereby a fixed rate of exchange could be assured between\r\nthe gold standard countries and the silver standard countries. This\r\ncommission has filed its preliminary report, which has been made\r\npublic. I deem it important that the commission be continued, and\r\nthat a sum of money be appropriated sufficient to pay the expenses of\r\nits further labors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA majority of our people desire that steps be taken in the interests\r\nof American shipping, so that we may once more resume our former\r\nposition in the ocean carrying trade. But hitherto the differences of\r\nopinion as to the proper method of reaching this end have been so wide\r\nthat it has proved impossible to secure the adoption of any particular\r\nscheme. Having in view these facts, I recommend that the Congress\r\ndirect the Secretary of the Navy, the Postmaster-General, and the\r\nSecretary of Commerce and Labor, associated with such a representation\r\nfrom the Senate and House of Representatives as the Congress in its\r\nwisdom may designate, to serve as a commission for the purpose of\r\ninvestigating and reporting to the Congress at its next session what\r\nlegislation is desirable or necessary for the development of the\r\nAmerican merchant marine and American commerce, and incidentally of\r\na national ocean mail service of adequate auxiliary naval cruisers\r\nand naval reserves. While such a measure is desirable in any event,\r\nit is especially desirable at this time, in view of the fact that our\r\npresent governmental contract for ocean mail with the American Line\r\nwill expire in 1905. Our ocean mail act was passed in 1891. In 1895\r\nour 20-knot transatlantic mail line was equal to any foreign line.\r\nSince then the Germans have put on 23-knot steamers, and the British\r\nhave contracted for 24-knot steamers. Our service should equal the\r\nbest. If it does not, the commercial public will abandon it. If we are\r\nto stay in the business it ought to be with a full understanding of\r\nthe advantages to the country on one hand, and on the other with exact\r\nknowledge of the cost and proper methods of carrying it on. Moreover,\r\nlines of cargo ships are of even more importance than fast mail lines,\r\nsave so far as the latter can be depended upon to furnish swift\r\nauxiliary cruisers in time of war. The establishment of new lines of\r\ncargo ships to South America, to Asia, and elsewhere would be much in\r\nthe interest of our commercial expansion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe can not have too much immigration of the right kind, and we should\r\nhave none at all of the wrong kind. The need is to devise some system\r\nby which undesirable immigrants shall be kept out entirely, while\r\ndesirable immigrants are properly distributed throughout the country.\r\nAt present some districts which need immigrants have none; and in\r\nothers, where the population is already congested, immigrants come in\r\nsuch numbers as to depress the conditions of life for those already\r\nthere. During the last two years the immigration service at New\r\nYork has been greatly improved, and the corruption and inefficiency\r\nwhich formerly obtained there have been eradicated. This service\r\nhas just been investigated by a committee of New York citizens of\r\nhigh standing, Messrs. Arthur v. Briesen, Lee K. Frankel, Eugene A.\r\nPhilbin, Thomas W. Hynes, and Ralph Trautmann. Their report deals\r\nwith the whole situation at length, and concludes with certain\r\nrecommendations for administrative and legislative action. It is now\r\nreceiving the attention of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe special investigation of the subject of naturalization under the\r\ndirection of the Attorney-General, and the consequent prosecutions,\r\nreveal a condition of affairs calling for the immediate attention\r\nof the Congress. Forgeries and perjuries of shameless and flagrant\r\ncharacter have been perpetrated, not only in the dense centres of\r\npopulation, but throughout the country; and it is established beyond\r\ndoubt that very many so-called citizens of the United States have\r\nno title whatever to that right, and are asserting and enjoying the\r\nbenefits of the same through the grossest frauds. It is never to be\r\nforgotten that citizenship is, to quote the words recently used by\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, an “inestimable heritage,”\r\nwhether it proceeds from birth within the country or is obtained by\r\nnaturalization; and we poison the sources of our national character\r\nand strength at the fountain, if the privilege is claimed and\r\nexercised without right, and by means of fraud and corruption. The\r\nbody politic can not be sound and healthy if many of its constituent\r\nmembers claim their standing through the prostitution of the high\r\nright and calling of citizenship. It should mean something to become a\r\ncitizen of the United States; and in the process no loophole whatever\r\nshould be left open to fraud.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which these frauds—now under full investigation with\r\na view to meting out punishment and providing adequate remedies—are\r\nperpetuated, include many variations of procedure by which false\r\ncertificates of citizenship are forged in their entirety; or genuine\r\ncertificates fraudulently or collusively obtained in blank are filled\r\nin by the criminal conspirators; or certificates are obtained on\r\nfraudulent statements as to the time of arrival and residence in this\r\ncountry; or imposition and substitution of another party for the real\r\npetitioner occur in court; or certificates are made the subject of\r\nbarter and sale and transferred from the rightful holder to those\r\nnot entitled to them; or certificates are forged by erasure of the\r\noriginal names and the insertion of the names of other persons not\r\nentitled to the same.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for me to refer here at large to the causes\r\nleading to this state of affairs. The desire for naturalization\r\nis heartily to be commended where it springs from a sincere and\r\npermanent intention to become citizens, and a real appreciation of\r\nthe privilege. But it is a source of untold evil and trouble where it\r\nis traceable to selfish and dishonest motives, such as the effort by\r\nartificial and improper means, in wholesale fashion to create voters\r\nwho are ready-made tools of corrupt politicians, or the desire to\r\nevade certain labor laws creating discriminations against alien labor.\r\nAll good citizens, whether naturalized or native born, are equally\r\ninterested in protecting our citizenship against fraud in any form,\r\nand, on the other hand, in affording every facility for naturalization\r\nto those who in good faith desire to share alike our privileges and\r\nour responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe Federal grand jury lately in session in New York City dealt with\r\nthis subject and made a presentment which states the situation briefly\r\nand forcibly and contains important suggestions for the consideration\r\nof the Congress. This presentment is included as an appendix to the\r\nreport of the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my last annual Message, in connection with the subject of the\r\ndue regulation of combinations of capital which are or may become\r\ninjurious to the public, I recommended a special appropriation for\r\nthe better enforcement of the anti-trust law as it now stands, to be\r\nexpended under the direction of the Attorney-General. Accordingly (by\r\nthe legislative, executive, and judicial appropriation act of February\r\n25, 1903, 32 Stat., 854, 904), the Congress appropriated, for the\r\npurpose of enforcing the various Federal trust and interstate commerce\r\nlaws, the sum of five hundred thousand dollars, to be expended under\r\nthe direction of the Attorney-General in the employment of special\r\ncounsel and agents in the Department of Justice to conduct proceedings\r\nand prosecutions under said laws in the courts of the United States.\r\nI now recommend, as a matter of the utmost importance and urgency,\r\nthe extension of the purposes of this appropriation, so that it may\r\nbe available, under the direction of the Attorney-General, and until\r\nused, for the due enforcement of the laws of the United States in\r\ngeneral and especially of the civil and criminal laws relating to\r\npublic lands and the laws relating to postal crimes and offences and\r\nthe subject of naturalization. Recent investigations have shown a\r\ndeplorable state of affairs in these three matters of vital concern.\r\nBy various frauds and by forgeries and perjuries, thousands of\r\nacres of the public domain, embracing lands of different character\r\nand extending through various sections of the country, have been\r\ndishonestly acquired. It is hardly necessary to urge the importance of\r\nrecovering these dishonest acquisitions, stolen from the people, and\r\nof promptly and duly punishing the offenders. I speak in another part\r\nof this Message of the widespread crimes by which the sacred right\r\nof citizenship is falsely asserted and that “inestimable heritage”\r\nperverted to base ends. By similar means—that is, through frauds,\r\nforgeries, and perjuries, and by shameless briberies—the laws relating\r\nto the proper conduct of the public service in general and to the due\r\nadministration of the Post-Office Department have been notoriously\r\nviolated, and many indictments have been found, and the consequent\r\nprosecutions are in course of hearing or on the eve thereof. For the\r\nreasons thus indicated, and so that the government may be prepared\r\nto enforce promptly and with the greatest effect the due penalties\r\nfor such violations of law, and to this end may be furnished with\r\nsufficient instrumentalities and competent legal assistance for the\r\ninvestigations and trials which will be necessary at many different\r\npoints of the country, I urge upon the Congress the necessity of\r\nmaking the said appropriation available for immediate use for all such\r\npurposes, to be expended under the direction of the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nSteps have been taken by the State Department looking to the making\r\nof bribery an extraditable offence with foreign powers. The need of\r\nmore effective treaties covering this crime is manifest. The exposures\r\nand prosecutions of official corruption in St. Louis, Mo., and other\r\ncities and States have resulted in a number of givers and takers of\r\nbribes becoming fugitives in foreign lands. Bribery has not been\r\nincluded in extradition treaties heretofore, as the necessity for it\r\nhas not arisen. While there may have been as much official corruption\r\nin former years, there has been more developed and brought to light\r\nin the immediate past than in the preceding century of our country’s\r\nhistory. It should be the policy of the United States to leave no\r\nplace on earth where a corrupt man fleeing from this country can rest\r\nin peace. There is no reason why bribery should not be included in\r\nall treaties as extraditable. The recent amended treaty with Mexico,\r\nwhereby this crime was put in the list of extraditable offences, has\r\nestablished a salutary precedent in this regard. Under this treaty the\r\nState Department has asked, and Mexico has granted, the extradition\r\nof one of the St. Louis bribe givers.\r\n\r\nThere can be no crime more serious than bribery. Other offences\r\nviolate one law while corruption strikes at the foundation of all\r\nlaw. Under our form of government all authority is vested in the\r\npeople and by them delegated to those who represent them in official\r\ncapacity. There can be no offence heavier than that of him in whom\r\nsuch a sacred trust has been reposed, who sells it for his own gain\r\nand enrichment; and no less heavy is the offence of the bribe giver.\r\nHe is worse than the thief, for the thief robs the individual, while\r\nthe corrupt official plunders an entire city or State. He is as wicked\r\nas the murderer, for the murderer may only take one life against the\r\nlaw, while the corrupt official and the man who corrupts the official\r\nalike aim at the assassination of the commonwealth itself. Government\r\nof the people, by the people, for the people will perish from the face\r\nof the earth if bribery is tolerated. The givers and takers of bribes\r\nstand on an evil pre-eminence of infamy. The exposure and punishment\r\nof public corruption is an honor to a nation, not a disgrace. The\r\nshame lies in toleration, not in correction. No city or State, still\r\nless the Nation, can be injured by the enforcement of law. As long\r\nas public plunderers when detected can find a haven of refuge in any\r\nforeign land and avoid punishment, just so long encouragement is given\r\nthem to continue their practices. If we fail to do all that in us lies\r\nto stamp out corruption we can not escape our share of responsibility\r\nfor the guilt. The first requisite of successful self-government is\r\nunflinching enforcement of the law and the cutting out of corruption.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor several years past the rapid development of Alaska and the\r\nestablishment of growing American interests in regions theretofore\r\nunsurveyed and imperfectly known brought into prominence the urgent\r\nnecessity of a practical demarcation of the boundaries between the\r\njurisdictions of the United States and Great Britain. Although the\r\ntreaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, the provisions of\r\nwhich were copied in the treaty of 1867, whereby Russia conveyed\r\nAlaska to the United States, was positive as to the control, first by\r\nRussia and later by the United States, of a strip of territory along\r\nthe continental mainland from the western shore of Portland Canal\r\nto Mount St. Elias, following and surrounding the indentations of\r\nthe coast and including the islands to the westward, its description\r\nof the landward margin of the strip was indefinite, resting on the\r\nsupposed existence of a continuous ridge or range of mountains\r\nskirting the coast, as figured in the charts of the early navigators.\r\nIt had at no time been possible for either party in interest to lay\r\ndown, under the authority of the treaty, a line so obviously exact\r\naccording to its provisions as to command the assent of the other.\r\nFor nearly three-fourths of a century the absence of tangible local\r\ninterests demanding the exercise of positive jurisdiction on either\r\nside of the border left the question dormant. In 1878, questions of\r\nrevenue administration on the Stikine River led to the establishment\r\nof a provisional demarcation, crossing the channel between two high\r\npeaks on either side about twenty-four miles above the river mouth. In\r\n1899, similar questions growing out of the extraordinary development\r\nof mining interests in the region about the head of Lynn Canal brought\r\nabout a temporary _modus vivendi_, by which a convenient separation\r\nwas made at the watershed divides of the White and Chilkoot passes\r\nand to the north of Klukwan, on the Klehini River. These partial and\r\ntentative adjustments could not, in the very nature of things, be\r\nsatisfactory or lasting. A permanent disposition of the matter became\r\nimperative.\r\n\r\nAfter unavailing attempts to reach an understanding through a Joint\r\nHigh Commission, followed by prolonged negotiations, conducted in an\r\namicable spirit, a convention between the United States and Great\r\nBritain was signed, January 24, 1903, providing for an examination\r\nof the subject by a mixed tribunal of six members, three on a side,\r\nwith a view to its final disposition. Ratifications were exchanged on\r\nMarch 3 last, whereupon the two governments appointed their respective\r\nmembers. Those on behalf of the United States were Elihu Root,\r\nSecretary of War; Henry Cabot Lodge, a Senator of the United States,\r\nand George Turner, an ex-Senator of the United States, while Great\r\nBritain named the Right Honorable Lord Alverstone, Lord Chief Justice\r\nof England; Sir Louis Amable Jetté, K.C.M.G., retired judge of the\r\nSupreme Court of Quebec, and A. B. Aylesworth, K.C., of Toronto. This\r\nTribunal met in London on September 3, under the Presidency of Lord\r\nAlverstone. The proceedings were expeditious, and marked by a friendly\r\nand conscientious spirit. The respective cases, counter cases, and\r\narguments presented the issues clearly and fully. On the 20th of\r\nOctober a majority of the Tribunal reached and signed an agreement on\r\nall the questions submitted by the terms of the Convention. By this\r\naward the right of the United States to the control of a continuous\r\nstrip or border of the mainland shore, skirting all the tide-water\r\ninlets and sinuosities of the coast, is confirmed; the entrance to\r\nPortland Canal (concerning which legitimate doubt appeared) is defined\r\nas passing by Tongass Inlet and to the northwestward of Wales and\r\nPearse Islands; a line is drawn from the head of Portland Canal to\r\nthe fifty-sixth degree of north latitude; and the interior border\r\nline of the strip is fixed by lines connecting certain mountain\r\nsummits lying between Portland Canal and Mount St. Elias, and running\r\nalong the crest of the divide separating the coast slope from the\r\ninland watershed at the only part of the frontier where the drainage\r\nridge approaches the coast within the distance of ten marine leagues\r\nstipulated by the treaty as the extreme width of the strip around the\r\nheads of Lynn Canal and its branches.\r\n\r\nWhile the line so traced follows the provisional demarcation of 1878\r\nat the crossing of the Stikine River, and that of 1899 at the summits\r\nof the White and Chilkoot passes, it runs much further inland from\r\nthe Klehini than the temporary line of the later _modus vivendi_, and\r\nleaves the entire mining district of the Porcupine River and Glacier\r\nCreek within the jurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe result is satisfactory in every way. It is of great material\r\nadvantage to our people in the Far Northwest. It has removed from the\r\nfield of discussion and possible danger a question liable to become\r\nmore acutely accentuated with each passing year. Finally, it has\r\nfurnished a signal proof of the fairness and good-will with which two\r\nfriendly nations can approach and determine issues involving national\r\nsovereignty and by their nature incapable of submission to a third\r\npower for adjudication.\r\n\r\nThe award is self-executing on the vital points. To make it effective\r\nas regards the others it only remains for the two governments to\r\nappoint, each on its own behalf, one or more scientific experts, who\r\nshall, with all convenient speed, proceed together to lay down the\r\nboundary line in accordance with the decision of the majority of the\r\nTribunal. I recommend that the Congress make adequate provision for\r\nthe appointment, compensation, and expenses of the members to serve on\r\nthis joint boundary commission on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that during the second session of the last\r\nCongress Great Britain, Germany, and Italy formed an alliance for\r\nthe purpose of blockading the ports of Venezuela and using such other\r\nmeans of pressure as would secure a settlement of claims due, as they\r\nalleged, to certain of their subjects. Their employment of force for\r\nthe collection of these claims was terminated by an agreement brought\r\nabout through the offices of the diplomatic representatives of the\r\nUnited States at Caracas and the Government at Washington, thereby\r\nending a situation which was bound to cause increasing friction, and\r\nwhich jeoparded the peace of the continent. Under this agreement\r\nVenezuela agreed to set apart a certain percentage of the customs\r\nreceipts of two of her ports to be applied to the payment of whatever\r\nobligations might be ascertained by mixed commissions appointed for\r\nthat purpose to be due from her, not only to the three powers already\r\nmentioned, whose proceedings against her had resulted in a state\r\nof war, but also to the United States, France, Spain, Belgium, the\r\nNetherlands, Sweden and Norway, and Mexico, who had not employed force\r\nfor the collection of the claims alleged to be due to certain of their\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nA demand was then made by the so-called blockading powers that the\r\nsums ascertained to be due to their citizens by such mixed commissions\r\nshould be accorded payment in full before anything was paid upon the\r\nclaims of any of the so-called peace powers. Venezuela, on the other\r\nhand, insisted that all her creditors should be paid upon a basis of\r\nexact equality. During the efforts to adjust this dispute it was\r\nsuggested by the powers in interest that it should be referred to me\r\nfor decision, but I was clearly of the opinion that a far wiser course\r\nwould be to submit the question to the Permanent Court of Arbitration\r\nat The Hague. It seemed to me to offer an admirable opportunity to\r\nadvance the practice of the peaceful settlement of disputes between\r\nnations and to secure for The Hague Tribunal a memorable increase of\r\nits practical importance. The nations interested in the controversy\r\nwere so numerous, and in many instances so powerful, as to make it\r\nevident that beneficent results would follow from their appearance at\r\nthe same time before the bar of that august tribunal of peace.\r\n\r\nOur hopes in that regard have been realized. Russia and Austria are\r\nrepresented in the persons of the learned and distinguished jurists\r\nwho compose the Tribunal, while Great Britain, Germany, France,\r\nSpain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway, Mexico,\r\nthe United States, and Venezuela are represented by their respective\r\nagents and counsel. Such an imposing concourse of nations presenting\r\ntheir arguments to and invoking the decision of that high court of\r\ninternational justice and international peace can hardly fail to\r\nsecure a like submission of many future controversies. The nations\r\nnow appearing there will find it far easier to appear there a second\r\ntime, while no nation can imagine its just pride will be lessened by\r\nfollowing the example now presented. This triumph of the principle of\r\ninternational arbitration is a subject of warm congratulation and\r\noffers a happy augury for the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nThere seems good ground for the belief that there has been a real\r\ngrowth among the civilized nations of a sentiment which will permit a\r\ngradual substitution of other methods than the method of war in the\r\nsettlement of disputes. It is not pretended that as yet we are near a\r\nposition in which it will be possible wholly to prevent war, or that a\r\njust regard for national interest and honor will in all cases permit\r\nof the settlement of international disputes by arbitration; but by a\r\nmixture of prudence and firmness with wisdom we think it is possible\r\nto do away with much of the provocation and excuse for war, and at\r\nleast in many cases to substitute some other and more rational method\r\nfor the settlement of disputes. The Hague Court offers so good an\r\nexample of what can be done in the direction of such settlement that\r\nit should be encouraged in every way.\r\n\r\nFurther steps should be taken. In President McKinley’s annual Message\r\nof December 5, 1898, he made the following recommendation:\r\n\r\n“The experiences of the last year bring forcibly home to us a sense\r\nof the burdens and the waste of war. We desire, in common with most\r\ncivilized nations, to reduce to the lowest possible point the damage\r\nsustained in time of war by peaceable trade and commerce. It is\r\ntrue we may suffer in such cases less than other communities, but\r\nall nations are damaged more or less by the state of uneasiness and\r\napprehension into which an outbreak of hostilities throws the entire\r\ncommercial world. It should be our object, therefore, to minimize, so\r\nfar as practicable, this inevitable loss and disturbance. This purpose\r\ncan probably best be accomplished by an international agreement\r\nto regard all private property at sea as exempt from capture or\r\ndestruction by the forces of belligerent powers. The United States\r\nGovernment has for many years advocated this humane and beneficent\r\nprinciple, and is now in a position to recommend it to other powers\r\nwithout the imputation of selfish motives. I therefore suggest for\r\nyour consideration that the Executive be authorized to correspond\r\nwith the governments of the principal maritime powers with a view\r\nof incorporating into the permanent law of civilized nations the\r\nprinciple of the exemption of all private property at sea, not\r\ncontraband of war, from capture or destruction by belligerent powers.”\r\n\r\nI cordially renew this recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court, speaking on December 11, 1899, through Peckham, J.,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“It is, we think, historically accurate to say that this Government\r\nhas always been, in its views, among the most advanced of the\r\ngovernments of the world in favor of mitigating, as to all\r\nnon-combatants, the hardships and horrors of war. To accomplish that\r\nobject it has always advocated those rules which would in most cases\r\ndo away with the right to capture the private property of an enemy on\r\nthe high seas.”\r\n\r\nI advocate this as a matter of humanity and morals. It is\r\nanachronistic when private property is respected on land that it\r\nshould not be respected at sea. Moreover, it should be borne in mind\r\nthat shipping represents, internationally speaking, a much more\r\ngeneralized species of private property than is the case with ordinary\r\nproperty on land—that is, property found at sea is much less apt than\r\nis the case with property found on land really to belong to any one\r\nnation. Under the modern system of corporate ownership the flag of a\r\nvessel often differs from the flag which would mark the nationality of\r\nthe real ownership and money control of the vessel; and the cargo may\r\nbelong to individuals of yet a different nationality. Much American\r\ncapital is now invested in foreign ships; and among foreign nations\r\nit often happens that the capital of one is largely invested in the\r\nshipping of another. Furthermore, as a practical matter, it may be\r\nmentioned that while commerce destroying may cause serious loss and\r\ngreat annoyance, it can never be more than a subsidiary factor in\r\nbringing to terms a resolute foe. This is now well recognized by all\r\nof our naval experts. The fighting ship, not the commerce destroyer,\r\nis the vessel whose feats add renown to a nation’s history, and\r\nestablish her place among the great powers of the world.\r\n\r\nLast year the Interparliamentary Union for International Arbitration\r\nmet at Vienna, six hundred members of the different legislatures of\r\ncivilized countries attending. It was provided that the next meeting\r\nshould be in 1904 at St. Louis, subject to our Congress extending an\r\ninvitation. Like The Hague Tribunal, this Interparliamentary Union\r\nis one of the forces tending toward peace among the nations of the\r\nearth, and it is entitled to our support. I trust the invitation can\r\nbe extended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in July, having received intelligence, which happily turned\r\nout to be erroneous, of the assassination of our vice-consul at\r\nBeirut, I despatched a small squadron to that port for such service\r\nas might be found necessary on arrival. Although the attempt on the\r\nlife of our vice-consul had not been successful, yet the outrage was\r\nsymptomatic of a state of excitement and disorder which demanded\r\nimmediate attention. The arrival of the vessels had the happiest\r\nresult. A feeling of security at once took the place of the former\r\nalarm and disquiet; our officers were cordially welcomed by the\r\nconsular body and the leading merchants, and ordinary business resumed\r\nits activity. The government of the Sultan gave a considerate hearing\r\nto the representations of our minister; the official who was regarded\r\nas responsible for the disturbed condition of affairs was removed.\r\nOur relations with the Turkish Government remain friendly; our claims\r\nfounded on inequitable treatment of some of our schools and missions\r\nappear to be in process of amicable adjustment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe signing of a new commercial treaty with China, which took place\r\nat Shanghai on the 8th of October, is a cause for satisfaction.\r\nThis act, the result of long discussion and negotiation, places\r\nour commercial relations with the great Oriental Empire on a more\r\nsatisfactory footing than they have ever heretofore enjoyed. It\r\nprovides not only for the ordinary rights and privileges of diplomatic\r\nand consular officers, but also for an important extension of our\r\ncommerce by increased facility of access to Chinese ports, and for\r\nthe relief of trade by the removal of some of the obstacles which\r\nhave embarrassed it in the past. The Chinese Government engages, on\r\nfair and equitable conditions, which will probably be accepted by the\r\nprincipal commercial nations, to abandon the levy of “liken” and other\r\ntransit dues throughout the Empire, and to introduce other desirable\r\nadministrative reforms. Larger facilities are to be given to our\r\ncitizens who desire to carry on mining enterprises in China. We have\r\nsecured for our missionaries a valuable privilege, the recognition of\r\ntheir right to rent and lease in perpetuity such property as their\r\nreligious societies may need in all parts of the Empire. And, what\r\nwas an indispensable condition for the advance and development of\r\nour commerce in Manchuria, China, by treaty with us, has opened to\r\nforeign commerce the cities of Mukden, the capital of the province of\r\nManchuria, and Antung, an important port on the Yalu River, on the\r\nroad to Korea. The full measure of development which our commerce may\r\nrightfully expect can hardly be looked for until the settlement of the\r\npresent abnormal state of things in the Empire; but the foundation\r\nfor such development has at last been laid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI call your attention to the reduced cost in maintaining the consular\r\nservice for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903, as shown in the\r\nannual report of the Auditor for the State and other Departments, as\r\ncompared with the year previous. For the year under consideration\r\nthe excess of expenditures over receipts on account of the consular\r\nservice amounted to $26,125.12, as against $96,972.50 for the year\r\nending June 30, 1902, and $147,040.16 for the year ending June 30,\r\n1901. This is the best showing in this respect for the consular\r\nservice for the past fourteen years, and the reduction in the cost\r\nof the service to the Government has been made in spite of the fact\r\nthat the expenditures for the year in question were more than $20,000\r\ngreater than for the previous year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rural free-delivery service has been steadily extended. The\r\nattention of the Congress is asked to the question of the compensation\r\nof the letter carriers and clerks engaged in the postal service,\r\nespecially on the new rural free-delivery routes. More routes have\r\nbeen installed since the first of July last than in any like period\r\nin the Department’s history. While a due regard to economy must be\r\nkept in mind in the establishment of new routes, yet the extension\r\nof the rural free-delivery system must be continued, for reasons\r\nof sound public policy. No governmental movement of recent years\r\nhas resulted in greater immediate benefit to the people of the\r\ncountry districts. Rural free-delivery, taken in connection with the\r\ntelephone, the bicycle, and the trolley, accomplishes much toward\r\nlessening the isolation of farm life and making it brighter and more\r\nattractive. In the immediate past the lack of just such facilities as\r\nthese has driven many of the more active and restless young men and\r\nwomen from the farms to the cities; for they rebelled at loneliness\r\nand lack of mental companionship. It is unhealthy and undesirable\r\nfor the cities to grow at the expense of the country; and rural\r\nfree-delivery is not only a good thing in itself, but is good because\r\nit is one of the causes which check this unwholesome tendency toward\r\nthe urban concentration of our population at the expense of the\r\ncountry districts. It is for the same reason that we sympathize with\r\nand approve of the policy of building good roads. The movement for\r\ngood roads is one fraught with the greatest benefit to the country\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI trust that the Congress will continue to favor in all proper ways\r\nthe Louisiana Purchase Exposition. This Exposition commemorates the\r\nLouisiana Purchase, which was the first great step in the expansion\r\nwhich made us a continental nation. The expedition of Lewis and Clark\r\nacross the continent followed thereon, and marked the beginning of\r\nthe process of exploration and colonization which thrust our national\r\nboundaries to the Pacific. The acquisition of the Oregon country,\r\nincluding the present States of Oregon and Washington, was a fact\r\nof immense importance in our history; first giving us our place on\r\nthe Pacific seaboard, and making ready the way for our ascendency in\r\nthe commerce of the greatest of the oceans. The centennial of our\r\nestablishment upon the western coast by the expedition of Lewis and\r\nClark is to be celebrated at Portland, Oregon, by an exposition in the\r\nsummer of 1905, and this event should receive recognition and support\r\nfrom the National Government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI call your special attention to the Territory of Alaska. The country\r\nis developing rapidly, and it has an assured future. The mineral\r\nwealth is great and has as yet hardly been tapped. The fisheries, if\r\nwisely handled and kept under national control, will be a business as\r\npermanent as any other, and of the utmost importance to the people.\r\nThe forests if properly guarded will form another great source of\r\nwealth. Portions of Alaska are fitted for farming and stock-raising,\r\nalthough the methods must be adapted to the peculiar conditions of\r\nthe country. Alaska is situated in the far north; but so are Norway\r\nand Sweden and Finland; and Alaska can prosper and play its part in\r\nthe New World just as those nations have prospered and played their\r\nparts in the Old World. Proper land laws should be enacted; and the\r\nsurvey of the public lands immediately begun. Coal-land laws should\r\nbe provided whereby the coal-land entryman may make his location\r\nand secure patent under methods kindred to those now prescribed\r\nfor homestead and mineral entrymen. Salmon hatcheries, exclusively\r\nunder government control, should be established. The cable should\r\nbe extended from Sitka westward. Wagon roads and trails should be\r\nbuilt, and the building of railroads promoted in all legitimate ways.\r\nLight-houses should be built along the coast. Attention should be paid\r\nto the needs of the Alaska Indians; provision should be made for an\r\nofficer, with deputies, to study their needs, relieve their immediate\r\nwants, and help them adapt themselves to the new conditions.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed to investigate, during the season of 1903,\r\nthe condition and needs of the Alaskan salmon fisheries, has finished\r\nits work in the field, and is preparing a detailed report thereon. A\r\npreliminary report reciting the measures immediately required for the\r\nprotection and preservation of the salmon industry has already been\r\nsubmitted to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor for his attention and\r\nfor the needed action.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI recommend that an appropriation be made for building light-houses in\r\nHawaii, and taking possession of those already built. The Territory\r\nshould be reimbursed for whatever amounts it has already expended for\r\nlight-houses. The Governor should be empowered to suspend or remove\r\nany official appointed by him, without submitting the matter to the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nOf our insular possessions, the Philippines and Porto Rico, it is\r\ngratifying to say that their steady progress has been such as to make\r\nit unnecessary to spend much time in discussing them. Yet the Congress\r\nshould ever keep in mind that a peculiar obligation rests upon us to\r\nfurther in every way the welfare of these communities. The Philippines\r\nshould be knit closer to us by tariff arrangements. It would, of\r\ncourse, be impossible suddenly to raise the people of the islands to\r\nthe high pitch of industrial prosperity and of governmental efficiency\r\nto which they will in the end by degrees attain; and the caution and\r\nmoderation shown in developing them have been among the main reasons\r\nwhy this development has hitherto gone on so smoothly.\r\n\r\nScrupulous care has been taken in the choice of governmental agents,\r\nand the entire elimination of partisan politics from the public\r\nservice. The condition of the islanders is in material things far\r\nbetter than ever before, while their governmental, intellectual,\r\nand moral advance has kept pace with their material advance. No one\r\npeople ever benefited another people more than we have benefited the\r\nFilipinos by taking possession of the islands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe cash receipts of the General Land Office for the last fiscal year\r\nwere $11,024,743.65, an increase of $4,762,816.47 over the preceding\r\nyear. Of this sum, approximately, $8,461,493 will go to the credit of\r\nthe fund for the reclamation of arid land, making the total of this\r\nfund, up to the 30th of June, 1903, approximately, $16,191,836.\r\n\r\nA gratifying disposition has been evinced by those having unlawful\r\ninclosures of public land to remove their fences. Nearly two\r\nmillion acres so inclosed have been thrown open on demand. In but\r\ncomparatively few cases has it been necessary to go into court to\r\naccomplish this purpose. This work will be vigorously prosecuted until\r\nall unlawful inclosures have been removed.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that in the Western States themselves, as well\r\nas in the rest of the country, there is widespread conviction that\r\ncertain of the public-land laws and the resulting administrative\r\npractice no longer meet the present needs. The character and uses of\r\nthe remaining public lands differ widely from those of the public\r\nlands which Congress had especially in view when these laws were\r\npassed. The rapidly increasing rate of disposal of the public lands is\r\nnot followed by a corresponding increase in home building. There is a\r\ntendency to mass in large holdings public lands, especially timber and\r\ngrazing lands, and thereby to retard settlement. I renew and emphasize\r\nmy recommendation of last year that so far as they are available for\r\nagriculture in its broadest sense, and to whatever extent they may\r\nbe reclaimed under the national irrigation law, the remaining public\r\nlands should be held rigidly for the home builder. The attention of\r\nthe Congress is especially directed to the timber and stone law, the\r\ndesert-land law, and the commutation clause of the homestead law,\r\nwhich in their operation have in many respects conflicted with wise\r\npublic-land policy. The discussions in the Congress and elsewhere have\r\nmade it evident that there is a wide divergence of opinions between\r\nthose holding opposite views on these subjects; and that the opposing\r\nsides have strong and convinced representatives of weight both within\r\nand without the Congress; the differences being not only as to\r\nmatters of opinion but as to matters of fact. In order that definite\r\ninformation may be available for the use of the Congress, I have\r\nappointed a commission composed of W. A. Richards, Commissioner of the\r\nGeneral Land Office; Gifford Pinchot, Chief of the Bureau of Forestry\r\nof the Department of Agriculture, and F. H. Newell, Chief Hydrographer\r\nof the Geological Survey, to report at the earliest practicable moment\r\nupon the condition, operation, and effect of the present land laws and\r\non the use, condition, disposal, and settlement of the public lands.\r\nThe commission will report especially what changes in organization,\r\nlaws, regulations, and practice affecting the public lands are needed\r\nto effect the largest practicable disposition of the public lands\r\nto actual settlers who will build permanent homes upon them, and\r\nto secure in permanence the fullest and most effective use of the\r\nresources of the public lands; and it will make such other reports\r\nand recommendations as its study of these questions may suggest. The\r\ncommission is to report immediately upon those points concerning\r\nwhich its judgment is clear; on any point upon which it has doubt it\r\nwill take the time necessary to make investigation and reach a final\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe work of reclamation of the arid lands of the West is progressing\r\nsteadily and satisfactorily under the terms of the law setting\r\naside the proceeds from the disposal of public lands. The corps of\r\nengineers known as the Reclamation Service, which is conducting the\r\nsurveys and examinations, has been thoroughly organized, especial\r\npains being taken to secure under the civil-service rules a body of\r\nskilled, experienced, and efficient men. Surveys and examinations\r\nare progressing throughout the arid States and Territories, plans\r\nfor reclaiming works being prepared and passed upon by boards of\r\nengineers before approval by the Secretary of the Interior. In Arizona\r\nand Nevada, in localities where such work is pre-eminently needed,\r\nconstruction has already been begun. In other parts of the arid West\r\nvarious projects are well advanced toward the drawing up of contracts,\r\nthese being delayed in part by necessities of reaching agreements or\r\nunderstanding as regards rights of way or acquisition of real estate.\r\nMost of the works contemplated for construction are of national\r\nimportance, involving interstate questions or the securing of stable,\r\nself-supporting communities in the midst of vast tracts of vacant\r\nland. The Nation as a whole is of course the gainer by the creation\r\nof these homes, adding as they do to the wealth and stability of the\r\ncountry, and furnishing a home market for the products of the East\r\nand South. The reclamation law, while perhaps not ideal, appears at\r\npresent to answer the larger needs for which it is designed. Further\r\nlegislation is not recommended until the necessities of change are\r\nmore apparent.\r\n\r\nThe study of the opportunities of reclamation of the vast extent of\r\narid land shows that whether this reclamation is done by individuals,\r\ncorporations, or the State, the sources of water supply must be\r\neffectively protected and the reservoirs guarded by the preservation\r\nof the forests at the headwaters of the streams. The engineers making\r\nthe preliminary examinations continually emphasize this need and urge\r\nthat the remaining public lands at the headwaters of the important\r\nstreams of the West be reserved to insure permanency of water supply\r\nfor irrigation. Much progress in forestry has been made during the\r\npast year. The necessity for perpetuating our forest resources,\r\nwhether in public or private hands, is recognized now as never before.\r\nThe demand for forest reserves has become insistent in the West,\r\nbecause the West must use the water, wood, and summer range which\r\nonly such reserves can supply. Progressive lumbermen are striving,\r\nthrough forestry, to give their business permanence. Other great\r\nbusiness interests are awakening to the need of forest preservation as\r\na business matter. The Government’s forest work should receive from\r\nthe Congress hearty support, and especially support adequate for the\r\nprotection of the forest reserves against fire. The forest reserve\r\npolicy of the Government has passed beyond the experimental stage and\r\nhas reached a condition where scientific methods are essential to its\r\nsuccessful prosecution. The administration features of forest reserves\r\nare at present unsatisfactory, being divided between three Bureaus\r\nof two Departments. It is therefore recommended that all matters\r\npertaining to forest reserves, except those involving or pertaining\r\nto land titles, be consolidated in the Bureau of Forestry of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe cotton-growing States have recently been invaded by a weevil\r\nthat has done much damage and threatens the entire cotton industry.\r\nI suggest to the Congress the prompt enactment of such remedial\r\nlegislation as its judgment may approve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn granting patents to foreigners the proper course for this country\r\nto follow is to give the same advantages to foreigners here that\r\nthe countries in which these foreigners dwell extend in return to\r\nour citizens; that is, to extend the benefits of our patent laws\r\non inventions and the like where in return the articles would be\r\npatentable in the foreign countries concerned—where an American could\r\nget a corresponding patent in such countries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Indian agents should not be dependent for their appointment\r\nor tenure of office upon considerations of partisan politics; the\r\npractice of appointing, when possible, ex-army officers or bonded\r\nsuperintendents to the vacancies that occur is working well.\r\nAttention is invited to the widespread illiteracy due to lack of\r\npublic schools in the Indian Territory. Prompt heed should be paid to\r\nthe need of education for the children in this Territory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my last annual Message the attention of the Congress was called\r\nto the necessity of enlarging the safety-appliance law, and it is\r\ngratifying to note that this law was amended in important respects.\r\nWith the increasing railway mileage of the country, the greater number\r\nof men employed, and the use of larger and heavier equipment, the\r\nurgency for renewed effort to prevent the loss of life and limb upon\r\nthe railroads of the country, particularly to employees, is apparent.\r\nFor the inspection of water craft and the Life-Saving Service upon\r\nthe water the Congress has built up an elaborate body of protective\r\nlegislation and a thorough method of inspection and is annually\r\nspending large sums of money. It is encouraging to observe that the\r\nCongress is alive to the interests of those who are employed upon our\r\nwonderful arteries of commerce—the railroads—who so safely transport\r\nmillions of passengers and billions of tons of freight. The Federal\r\ninspection of safety appliances, for which the Congress is now making\r\nappropriations, is a service analogous to that which the Government\r\nhas upheld for generations in regard to vessels, and it is believed\r\nwill prove of great practical benefit, both to railroad employees and\r\nthe traveling public. As the greater part of commerce is interstate\r\nand exclusively under the control of the Congress the needed safety\r\nand uniformity must be secured by national legislation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo other class of our citizens deserves so well of the Nation as those\r\nto whom the Nation owes its very being, the veterans of the Civil War.\r\nSpecial attention is asked to the excellent work of the Pension Bureau\r\nin expediting and disposing of pension claims. During the fiscal year\r\nending July 1, 1903, the Bureau settled 251,982 claims, an average of\r\n825 claims for each working day of the year. The number of settlements\r\nsince July 1, 1903, has been in excess of last year’s average,\r\napproaching 1,000 claims for each working day, and it is believed that\r\nthe work of the Bureau will be current at the close of the present\r\nfiscal year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the year ended June 30 last 25,566 persons were appointed\r\nthrough competitive examinations under the civil-service rules.\r\nThis was 12,672 more than during the preceding year, and 40 per\r\ncent of those who passed the examinations. This abnormal growth was\r\nlargely occasioned by the extension of classification to the rural\r\nfree-delivery service and the appointment last year of over 9,000\r\nrural carriers.\r\n\r\nA revision of the civil-service rules took effect on April 15 last,\r\nwhich has greatly improved their operation. The completion of the\r\nreform of the civil service is recognized by good citizens everywhere\r\nas a matter of the highest public importance, and the success of\r\nthe merit system largely depends upon the effectiveness of the rules\r\nand the machinery provided for their enforcement. A very gratifying\r\nspirit of friendly co-operation exists in all the Departments of the\r\nGovernment in the enforcement and uniform observance of both the\r\nletter and spirit of the civil-service act. Executive orders of July\r\n3, 1902, March 26, 1903, and July 8, 1903, require that appointments\r\nof all unclassified laborers, both in the Departments at Washington\r\nand in the field service, shall be made with the assistance of the\r\nUnited States Civil Service Commission, under a system of registration\r\nto test the relative fitness of applicants for appointment or\r\nemployment. This system is competitive, and is open to all citizens of\r\nthe United States qualified in respect to age, physical ability, moral\r\ncharacter, industry, and adaptability for manual labor; except that in\r\ncase of veterans of the Civil War the element of age is omitted. This\r\nsystem of appointment is distinct from the classified service and does\r\nnot classify positions of mere laborer under the civil-service act\r\nand rules. Regulations in aid thereof have been put in operation in\r\nseveral of the Departments and are being gradually extended in other\r\nparts of the service. The results have been very satisfactory, as\r\nextravagance has been checked by decreasing the number of unnecessary\r\npositions and by increasing the efficiency of the employees remaining.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Congress, as the result of a thorough investigation of the\r\ncharities and reformatory institutions in the District of Columbia,\r\nby a joint select committee of the two Houses which made its report\r\nin March, 1898, created in the act approved June 6, 1900, a board of\r\ncharities for the District of Columbia, to consist of five residents\r\nof the District, appointed by the President of the United States,\r\nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate, each for a term\r\nof three years, to serve without compensation. President McKinley\r\nappointed five men who had been active and prominent in the public\r\ncharities of Washington, all of whom upon taking office July 1,\r\n1900, resigned from the different charities with which they had\r\nbeen connected. The members of the board have been reappointed in\r\nsuccessive years. The board serves under the Commissioners of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. The board gave its first year to a careful and\r\nimpartial study of the special problems before it, and has continued\r\nthat study every year in the light of the best practice in public\r\ncharities elsewhere. Its recommendations in its annual reports to the\r\nCongress through the Commissions of the District of Columbia “for\r\nthe economical and efficient administration of the charities and\r\nreformatories of the District of Columbia,” as required by the act\r\ncreating it, have been based upon the principles commended by the\r\njoint select committee of the Congress in its report of March, 1898,\r\nand approved by the best administrators of public charities, and make\r\nfor the desired systematization and improvement of the affairs under\r\nits supervision. They are worthy of favorable consideration by the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe effect of the laws providing a General Staff for the army and\r\nfor the more effective use of the National Guard has been excellent.\r\nGreat improvement has been made in the efficiency of our army in\r\nrecent years. Such schools as those erected at Fort Leavenworth and\r\nFort Riley and the institution of fall manœuvre work accomplish\r\nsatisfactory results. The good effect of these manœuvres upon the\r\nNational Guard is marked, and ample appropriation should be made to\r\nenable the guardsmen of the several States to share in the benefit.\r\nThe Government should as soon as possible secure suitable permanent\r\ncamp sites for military manœuvres in the various sections of the\r\ncountry. The service thereby rendered not only to the Regular Army,\r\nbut to the National Guard of the several States, will be so great as\r\nto repay many times over the relatively small expense. We should not\r\nrest satisfied with what has been done, however. The only people who\r\nare contented with a system of promotion by mere seniority are those\r\nwho are contented with the triumph of mediocrity over excellence. On\r\nthe other hand a system which encouraged the exercise of social or\r\npolitical favoritism in promotions would be even worse. But it would\r\nsurely be easy to devise a method of promotion from grade to grade\r\nin which the opinion of the higher officers of the service upon the\r\ncandidates should be decisive upon the standing and promotion of the\r\nlatter. Just such a system now obtains at West Point. The quality of\r\neach year’s work determines the standing of that year’s class, the\r\nman being dropped or graduated into the next class in the relative\r\nposition which his military superiors decide to be warranted by his\r\nmerit. In other words, ability, energy, fidelity, and all other\r\nsimilar qualities determine the rank of a man year after year in West\r\nPoint, and his standing in the army when he graduates from West Point;\r\nbut from that time on, all effort to find which man is best or worst,\r\nand reward or punish him accordingly, is abandoned; no brilliancy,\r\nno amount of hard work, no eagerness in the performance of duty, can\r\nadvance him, and no slackness or indifference that falls short of a\r\ncourt-martial offence can retard him. Until this system is changed\r\nwe can not hope that our officers will be of as high grade as we\r\nhave a right to expect, considering the material upon which we draw.\r\nMoreover, when a man renders such service as Captain Pershing rendered\r\nlast spring in the Moro campaign, it ought to be possible to reward\r\nhim without at once jumping him to the grade of brigadier-general.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShortly after the enunciation of that famous principle of American\r\nforeign policy now known as the “Monroe Doctrine,” President Monroe,\r\nin a special Message to Congress on January 30, 1824, spoke as\r\nfollows: “The navy is the arm from which our Government will always\r\nderive most aid in support of our ... rights. Every power engaged in\r\nwar will know the strength of our naval power, the number of our ships\r\nof each class, their condition, and the promptitude with which we\r\nmay bring them into service, and will pay due consideration to that\r\nargument.”\r\n\r\nI heartily congratulate the Congress upon the steady progress in\r\nbuilding up the American Navy. We can not afford a let-up in this\r\ngreat work. To stand still means to go back. There should be no\r\ncessation in adding to the effective units of the fighting strength of\r\nthe fleet. Meanwhile the Navy Department and the officers of the navy\r\nare doing well their part by providing constant service at sea under\r\nconditions akin to those of actual warfare. Our officers and enlisted\r\nmen are learning to handle the battleships, cruisers, and torpedo\r\nboats with high efficiency in fleet and squadron formations, and the\r\nstandard of marksmanship is being steadily raised. The best work\r\nashore is indispensable, but the highest duty of a naval officer is to\r\nexercise command at sea.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a naval base in the Philippines ought not to\r\nbe longer postponed. Such a base is desirable in time of peace; in\r\ntime of war it would be indispensable, and its lack would be ruinous.\r\nWithout it our fleet would be helpless. Our naval experts are agreed\r\nthat Subig Bay is the proper place for the purpose. The national\r\ninterests require that the work of fortification and development of\r\na naval station at Subig Bay be begun at an early date; for under the\r\nbest conditions it is a work which will consume much time.\r\n\r\nIt is eminently desirable, however, that there should be provided a\r\nnaval general staff on lines similar to those of the General Staff\r\nlately created for the army. Within the Navy Department itself the\r\nneeds of the service have brought about a system under which the\r\nduties of a general staff are partially performed; for the Bureau\r\nof Navigation has under its direction the War College, the Office\r\nof Naval Intelligence, and the Board of Inspection, and has been in\r\nclose touch with the General Board of the navy. But though under the\r\nexcellent officers at their head these boards and bureaus do good\r\nwork, they have not the authority of a general staff, and have not\r\nsufficient scope to ensure a proper readiness for emergencies. We need\r\nthe establishment by law of a body of trained officers, who shall\r\nexercise a systematic control of the military affairs of the navy, and\r\nbe authorized advisers of the Secretary concerning it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the act of June 28, 1902, the Congress authorized the President to\r\nenter into treaty with Colombia for the building of the canal across\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama; it being provided that in the event of failure\r\nto secure such treaty after the lapse of a reasonable time, recourse\r\nshould be had to building a canal through Nicaragua. It has not been\r\nnecessary to consider this alternative, as I am enabled to lay before\r\nthe Senate a treaty providing for the building of the canal across the\r\nIsthmus of Panama. This was the route which commended itself to the\r\ndeliberate judgment of the Congress, and we can now acquire by treaty\r\nthe right to construct the canal over this route. The question now,\r\ntherefore, is not by which route the Isthmian Canal shall be built,\r\nfor that question has been definitely and irrevocably decided. The\r\nquestion is simply whether or not we shall have an Isthmian Canal.\r\n\r\nWhen the Congress directed that we should take the Panama route\r\nunder treaty with Colombia, the essence of the condition, of course,\r\nreferred not to the government which controlled that route, but to the\r\nroute itself; to the territory across which the route lay, not to the\r\nname which for the moment the territory bore on the map. The purpose\r\nof the law was to authorize the President to make a treaty with the\r\npower in actual control of the Isthmus of Panama. This purpose has\r\nbeen fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1846 this Government entered into a treaty with New\r\nGranada, the predecessor upon the Isthmus of the Republic of Colombia\r\nand of the present Republic of Panama, by which treaty it was provided\r\nthat the Government and citizens of the United States should always\r\nhave free and open right of way or transit across the Isthmus of\r\nPanama by any modes of communication that might be constructed, while\r\nin return our Government guaranteed the perfect neutrality of the\r\nabove-mentioned Isthmus with the view that the free transit from the\r\none to the other sea might not be interrupted or embarrassed. The\r\ntreaty vested in the United States a substantial property right carved\r\nout of the rights of sovereignty and property which New Granada then\r\nhad and possessed over the said territory. The name of New Granada has\r\npassed away and its territory has been divided. Its successor, the\r\nGovernment of Colombia, has ceased to own any property in the Isthmus.\r\nA new republic, that of Panama, which was at one time a sovereign\r\nstate, and at another time a mere department of the successive\r\nconfederations known as New Granada and Colombia, has now succeeded to\r\nthe rights which first one and then the other formerly exercised over\r\nthe Isthmus. But as long as the Isthmus endures, the mere geographical\r\nfact of its existence, and the peculiar interest therein which is\r\nrequired by our position, perpetuate the solemn contract which binds\r\nthe holders of the territory to respect our right to freedom of\r\ntransit across it, and binds us in return to safeguard for the Isthmus\r\nand the world the exercise of that inestimable privilege. The true\r\ninterpretation of the obligations upon which the United States entered\r\nin this treaty of 1846 has been given repeatedly in the utterances of\r\nPresidents and Secretaries of State. Secretary Cass in 1858 officially\r\nstated the position of this Government as follows:\r\n\r\n“The progress of events has rendered the interoceanic route across the\r\nnarrow portion of Central America vastly important to the commercial\r\nworld, and especially to the United States, whose possessions extend\r\nalong the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and demand the speediest and\r\neasiest modes of communication. While the rights of sovereignty of\r\nthe states occupying this region should always be respected, we\r\nshall expect that these rights be exercised in a spirit befitting\r\nthe occasion and the wants and circumstances that have arisen.\r\nSovereignty has its duties as well as its rights, and none of these\r\nlocal governments, even if administered with more regard to the just\r\ndemands of other nations than they have been, would be permitted, in\r\na spirit of Eastern isolation, to close the gates of intercourse on\r\nthe great highways of the world, and justify the act by the pretension\r\nthat these avenues of trade and travel belong to them and that they\r\nchoose to shut them, or, what is almost equivalent, to encumber them\r\nwith such unjust relations as would prevent their general use.”\r\n\r\nSeven years later, in 1865, Mr. Seward in different communications\r\ntook the following position:\r\n\r\n“The United States have taken and will take no interest in any\r\nquestion of internal revolution in the State of Panama, or any\r\nState of the United States of Colombia, but will maintain a perfect\r\nneutrality in connection with such domestic altercations. The United\r\nStates will, nevertheless, hold themselves ready to protect the\r\ntransit trade across the Isthmus against invasion of either domestic\r\nor foreign disturbers of the peace of the State of Panama.... Neither\r\nthe text nor the spirit of the stipulation in that article by which\r\nthe United States engages to preserve the neutrality of the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, imposes an obligation on this Government to comply with the\r\nrequisition [of the President of the United States of Colombia for a\r\nforce to protect the Isthmus of Panama from a body of insurgents of\r\nthat country]. The purpose of the stipulation was to guarantee the\r\nIsthmus against seizure or invasion by a foreign power only.”\r\n\r\nAttorney-General Speed, under date of November 7, 1865, advised\r\nSecretary Seward as follows:\r\n\r\n“From this treaty it can not be supposed that New Granada invited the\r\nUnited States to become a party to the intestine troubles of that\r\ngovernment, nor did the United States become bound to take sides in\r\nthe domestic broils of New Granada. The United States did guarantee\r\nNew Granada in the sovereignty and property over the territory. This\r\nwas as against other and foreign governments.”\r\n\r\nFor four hundred years, ever since shortly after the discovery of this\r\nhemisphere, the canal across the Isthmus has been planned. For two\r\nscore years it has been worked at. When made it is to last for the\r\nages. It is to alter the geography of a continent and the trade routes\r\nof the world. We have shown by every treaty we have negotiated or\r\nattempted to negotiate with the peoples in control of the Isthmus and\r\nwith foreign nations in reference thereto our consistent good faith\r\nin observing our obligations; on the one hand to the peoples of the\r\nIsthmus, and on the other hand to the civilized world whose commercial\r\nrights we are safeguarding and guaranteeing by our action. We have\r\ndone our duty to others in letter and in spirit, and we have shown the\r\nutmost forbearance in exacting our own rights.\r\n\r\nLast spring, under the act above referred to, a treaty concluded\r\nbetween the representatives of the Republic of Colombia and of our\r\nGovernment was ratified by the Senate. This treaty was entered into at\r\nthe urgent solicitation of the people of Colombia and after a body of\r\nexperts appointed by our Government especially to go into the matter\r\nof the routes across the Isthmus had pronounced unanimously in favor\r\nof the Panama route. In drawing up this treaty every concession was\r\nmade to the people and to the Government of Colombia. We were more\r\nthan just in dealing with them. Our generosity was such as to make it\r\na serious question whether we had not gone too far in their interest\r\nat the expense of our own; for in our scrupulous desire to pay all\r\npossible heed, not merely to the real but even to the fancied rights\r\nof our weaker neighbor, who already owed so much to our protection\r\nand forbearance, we yielded in all possible ways to her desires in\r\ndrawing up the treaty. Nevertheless the Government of Colombia not\r\nmerely repudiated the treaty, but repudiated it in such manner as to\r\nmake it evident by the time the Colombian Congress adjourned that not\r\nthe scantiest hope remained of ever getting a satisfactory treaty\r\nfrom them. The Government of Colombia made the treaty, and yet when\r\nthe Colombian Congress was called to ratify it the vote against\r\nratification was unanimous. It does not appear that the government\r\nmade any real effort to secure ratification.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the adjournment of the Congress a revolution broke\r\nout in Panama. The people of Panama had long been discontented with\r\nthe Republic of Colombia, and they had been kept quiet only by\r\nthe prospect of the conclusion of the treaty, which was to them a\r\nmatter of vital concern. When it became evident that the treaty was\r\nhopelessly lost, the people of Panama rose literally as one man. Not\r\na shot was fired by a single man on the Isthmus in the interest of\r\nthe Colombian Government. Not a life was lost in the accomplishment\r\nof the revolution. The Colombian troops stationed on the Isthmus, who\r\nhad long been unpaid, made common cause with the people of Panama,\r\nand with astonishing unanimity the new republic was started. The duty\r\nof the United States in the premises was clear. In strict accordance\r\nwith the principles laid down by Secretaries Cass and Seward in the\r\nofficial documents above quoted, the United States gave notice that\r\nit would permit the landing of no expeditionary force, the arrival\r\nof which would mean chaos and destruction along the line of the\r\nrailroad and of the proposed canal, and an interruption of transit\r\nas an inevitable consequence. The de facto Government of Panama was\r\nrecognized in the following telegram to Mr. Ehrman:\r\n\r\n  “The people of Panama have, by apparently unanimous movement,\r\n  dissolved their political connection with the Republic of Colombia\r\n  and resumed their independence. When you are satisfied that a\r\n  de facto government, republican in form and without substantial\r\n  opposition from its own people, has been established in the State\r\n  of Panama, you will enter into relations with it as the responsible\r\n  government of the territory and look to it for all due action to\r\n  protect the persons and property of citizens of the United States\r\n  and to keep open the isthmian transit, in accordance with the\r\n  obligations of existing treaties governing the relations of the\r\n  United States to that territory.”\r\n\r\nThe Government of Colombia was notified of our action by the following\r\ntelegram to Mr. Beaupré:\r\n\r\n  “The people of Panama having, by an apparently unanimous movement,\r\n  dissolved their political connection with the Republic of Colombia\r\n  and resumed their independence, and having adopted a government of\r\n  their own, republican in form, with which the Government of the\r\n  United States of America has entered into relations, the President\r\n  of the United States, in accordance with the ties of friendship\r\n  which have so long and so happily existed between the respective\r\n  nations, most earnestly commends to the Governments of Colombia and\r\n  of Panama the peaceful and equitable settlement of all questions at\r\n  issue between them. He holds that he is bound not merely by treaty\r\n  obligations, but by the interests of civilization, to see that the\r\n  peaceful traffic of the world across the Isthmus of Panama shall\r\n  not longer be disturbed by a constant succession of unnecessary and\r\n  wasteful wars.”\r\n\r\nWhen these events happened, fifty-seven years had elapsed since the\r\nUnited States had entered into its treaty with New Granada. During\r\nthat time the Governments of New Granada and of its successor,\r\nColombia, have been in a constant state of flux. The following is\r\na partial list of the disturbances on the Isthmus of Panama during\r\nthe period in question, as reported to us by our consuls. It is not\r\npossible to give a complete list, and some of the reports that speak\r\nof “revolutions” must mean unsuccessful revolutions.\r\n\r\n  May 22, 1850.—Outbreak; two Americans killed. War vessel demanded to\r\n  quell outbreak.\r\n\r\n  October, 1850.—Revolutionary plot to bring about independence of the\r\n  Isthmus.\r\n\r\n  July 22, 1851.—Revolution in four Southern provinces.\r\n\r\n  November 14, 1851.—Outbreak at Chagres.

United States\r\n  forces landed.\r\n\r\n  December 18, 1858.—Attempted secession of Panama.\r\n\r\n  April, 1859.—Riots.\r\n\r\n  September, 1860.—Outbreak.\r\n\r\n  October 4, 1860.—Landing of United States forces in consequence.\r\n\r\n  May 23, 1861.—Intervention of the United States forces required, by\r\n  intendente.\r\n\r\n  October 2, 1861.—Insurrection and civil war.\r\n\r\n  April 4, 1862.—Measures to prevent rebels crossing Isthmus.\r\n\r\n  June 13, 1862.—Mosquera’s troops refused admittance to Panama.\r\n\r\n  March, 1865.—Revolution, and United States troops landed.\r\n\r\n  August, 1865.—Riots; unsuccessful attempt to invade Panama.\r\n\r\n  March, 1866.—Unsuccessful revolution.\r\n\r\n  April, 1867.—Attempt to overthrow Government.\r\n\r\n  August, 1867.—Attempt at revolution.\r\n\r\n  July 5, 1868.—Revolution; provisional government inaugurated.\r\n\r\n  August 29, 1868.—Revolution; provisional government overthrown.\r\n\r\n  April, 1871.—Revolution; followed apparently by counter revolution.\r\n\r\n  April, 1873.—Revolution and civil war which lasted to October, 1875.\r\n\r\n  August, 1876.—Civil war which lasted until April, 1877.\r\n\r\n  July, 1878.—Rebellion.\r\n\r\n  December, 1878.—Revolt.\r\n\r\n  April, 1879.—Revolution.\r\n\r\n  June, 1879.—Revolution.\r\n\r\n  March, 1883.—Riot.\r\n\r\n  May, 1883.—Riot.\r\n\r\n  June, 1884.—Revolutionary attempt.\r\n\r\n  December, 1884.—Revolutionary attempt.\r\n\r\n  January, 1885.—Revolutionary disturbances.\r\n\r\n  March, 1885.—Revolution.\r\n\r\n  April, 1887.—Disturbance on Panama Railroad.\r\n\r\n  November, 1887.—Disturbance on line of canal.\r\n\r\n  January, 1889.—Riot.\r\n\r\n  January, 1895.—Revolution which lasted until April.\r\n\r\n  March, 1895.—Incendiary attempt.\r\n\r\n  October, 1899.—Revolution.\r\n\r\n  February, 1900, to July, 1900.—Revolution.\r\n\r\n  January, 1901.—Revolution.\r\n\r\n  July, 1901.—Revolutionary disturbances.\r\n\r\n  September, 1901.—City of Colon taken by rebels.\r\n\r\n  March, 1902.—Revolutionary disturbances.\r\n\r\n  July, 1902.—Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe above is only a partial list of the revolutions, rebellions,\r\ninsurrections, riots, and other outbreaks that have occurred during\r\nthe period in question; yet they number 53 for the 57 years. It will\r\nbe noted that one of them lasted for nearly three years before it\r\nwas quelled; another for nearly a year. In short, the experience of\r\nover half a century has shown Colombia to be utterly incapable of\r\nkeeping order on the Isthmus. Only the active interference of the\r\nUnited States has enabled her to preserve so much as a semblance of\r\nsovereignty. Had it not been for the exercise by the United States\r\nof the police power in her interest, her connection with the Isthmus\r\nwould have been sundered long ago. In 1856, in 1860, in 1873, in\r\n1885, in 1901, and again in 1902, sailors and marines from United\r\nStates warships were forced to land in order to patrol the Isthmus,\r\nto protect life and property, and to see that the transit across\r\nthe Isthmus was kept open. In 1861, in 1862, in 1885, and in 1900,\r\nthe Colombian Government asked that the United States Government\r\nwould land troops to protect its interests and maintain order on the\r\nIsthmus. Perhaps the most extraordinary request is that which has just\r\nbeen received and which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n“Knowing that revolution has already commenced in Panama [an eminent\r\nColombian] says that if the Government of the United States will\r\nland troops to preserve Colombian sovereignty, and the transit, if\r\nrequested by Colombian chargé d’affaires, this government will declare\r\nmartial law; and, by virtue of vested constitutional authority, when\r\npublic order is disturbed, will approve by decree the ratification\r\nof the canal treaty as signed; or, if the Government of the United\r\nStates prefers, will call extra session of the Congress—with new\r\nand friendly members—next May to approve the treaty. [An eminent\r\nColombian] has the perfect confidence of vice-president, he says, and\r\nif it became necessary will go to the Isthmus or send representative\r\nthere to adjust matters along above lines to the satisfaction of the\r\npeople there.”\r\n\r\nThis despatch is noteworthy from two standpoints. Its offer of\r\nimmediately guaranteeing the treaty to us is in sharp contrast with\r\nthe positive and contemptuous refusal of the Congress which has just\r\nclosed its sessions to consider favorably such a treaty; it shows\r\nthat the government which made the treaty really had absolute control\r\nover the situation, but did not choose to exercise this control. The\r\ndespatch further calls on us to restore order and secure Colombian\r\nsupremacy in the Isthmus from which the Colombian Government has just\r\nby its action decided to bar us by preventing the construction of the\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nThe control, in the interest of the commerce and traffic of the whole\r\ncivilized world, of the means of undisturbed transit across the\r\nIsthmus of Panama has become of transcendent importance to the United\r\nStates. We have repeatedly exercised this control by intervening in\r\nthe course of domestic dissension, and by protecting the territory\r\nfrom foreign invasion. In 1853 Mr. Everett assured the Peruvian\r\nminister that we should not hesitate to maintain the neutrality of\r\nthe Isthmus in the case of war between Peru and Colombia. In 1864\r\nColombia, which has always been vigilant to avail itself of its\r\nprivileges conferred by the treaty, expressed its expectation that\r\nin the event of war between Peru and Spain the United States would\r\ncarry into effect the guarantee of neutrality. There have been few\r\nadministrations of the State Department in which this treaty has\r\nnot, either by the one side or the other, been used as a basis of\r\nmore or less important demands. It was said by Mr. Fish in 1871 that\r\nthe Department of State had reason to believe that an attack upon\r\nColombian sovereignty on the Isthmus had, on several occasions, been\r\naverted by warning from this Government. In 1886, when Colombia was\r\nunder the menace of hostilities from Italy in the Cerruti case, Mr.\r\nBayard expressed the serious concern that the United States could\r\nnot but feel, that a European power should resort to force against\r\na sister republic of this hemisphere, as to the sovereign and\r\nuninterrupted use of a part of whose territory we are guarantors under\r\nthe solemn faith of a treaty.\r\n\r\nThe above recital of facts establishes beyond question: First, that\r\nthe United States has for over half a century patiently and in good\r\nfaith carried out its obligations under the treaty of 1846; second,\r\nthat when for the first time it became possible for Colombia to do\r\nanything in requital of the services thus repeatedly rendered to it\r\nfor fifty-seven years by the United States, the Colombian Government\r\nperemptorily and offensively refused thus to do its part, even though\r\nto do so would have been to its advantage and immeasurably to the\r\nadvantage of the State of Panama, at that time under its jurisdiction;\r\nthird, that throughout this period revolutions, riots, and factional\r\ndisturbances of every kind have occurred one after the other in almost\r\nuninterrupted succession, some of them lasting for months and even for\r\nyears, while the central government was unable to put them down or to\r\nmake peace with the rebels; fourth, that these disturbances instead of\r\nshowing any sign of abating have tended to grow more numerous and more\r\nserious in the immediate past; fifth, that the control of Colombia\r\nover the Isthmus of Panama could not be maintained without the armed\r\nintervention and assistance of the United States. In other words, the\r\nGovernment of Colombia, though wholly unable to maintain order on the\r\nIsthmus, has nevertheless declined to ratify a treaty the conclusion\r\nof which opened the only chance to secure its own stability and to\r\nguarantee permanent peace on, and the construction of a canal across,\r\nthe Isthmus.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, the Government of the United States would\r\nhave been guilty of folly and weakness, amounting in their sum to a\r\ncrime against the Nation, had it acted otherwise than it did when\r\nthe revolution of November 3 last took place in Panama. This great\r\nenterprise of building the interoceanic canal can not be held up to\r\ngratify the whims, or out of respect to the governmental impotence,\r\nor to the even more sinister and evil political peculiarities, of\r\npeople who, though they dwell afar off, yet, against the wish of the\r\nactual dwellers on the Isthmus, assert an unreal supremacy over the\r\nterritory. The possession of a territory fraught with such peculiar\r\ncapacities as the Isthmus in question carries with it obligations to\r\nmankind. The course of events has shown that this canal can not be\r\nbuilt by private enterprise, or by any other nation than our own;\r\ntherefore it must be built by the United States.\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made by the Government of the United States to\r\npersuade Colombia to follow a course which was essentially not only to\r\nour interests and to the interests of the world, but to the interests\r\nof Colombia itself. These efforts have failed; and Colombia, by her\r\npersistence in repulsing the advances that have been made, has forced\r\nus, for the sake of our own honor, and of the interest and well-being,\r\nnot merely of our own people, but of the people of the Isthmus of\r\nPanama and the people of the civilized countries of the world, to\r\ntake decisive steps to bring to an end a condition of affairs which\r\nhad become intolerable. The new Republic of Panama immediately\r\noffered to negotiate a treaty with us. This treaty I herewith submit.\r\nBy it our interests are better safeguarded than in the treaty with\r\nColombia which was ratified by the Senate at its last session. It is\r\nbetter in its terms than the treaties offered to us by the Republics\r\nof Nicaragua and Costa Rica. At last the right to begin this great\r\nundertaking is made available. Panama has done her part. All that\r\nremains is for the American Congress to do its part and forthwith this\r\nRepublic will enter upon the execution of a project colossal in its\r\nsize and of wellnigh incalculable possibilities for the good of this\r\ncountry and the nations of mankind.\r\n\r\nBy the provisions of the treaty the United States guarantees and will\r\nmaintain the independence of the Republic of Panama. There is granted\r\nto the United States in perpetuity the use, occupation, and control of\r\na strip ten miles wide and extending three nautical miles into the sea\r\nat either terminal, with all lands lying outside of the zone necessary\r\nfor the construction of the canal or for its auxiliary works, and with\r\nthe islands in the Bay of Panama. The cities of Panama and Colon are\r\nnot embraced in the canal zone, but the United States assumes their\r\nsanitation and, in case of need, the maintenance of order therein;\r\nthe United States enjoys within the granted limits all the rights,\r\npower, and authority which it would possess were it the sovereign of\r\nthe territory to the exclusion of the exercise of sovereign rights\r\nby the republic. All railway and canal property rights belonging to\r\nPanama and needed for the canal pass to the United States, including\r\nany property of the respective companies in the cities of Panama and\r\nColon; the works, property, and personnel of the canal and railways\r\nare exempted from taxation as well in the cities of Panama and Colon\r\nas in the canal zone and its dependencies. Free immigration of the\r\npersonnel and importation of supplies for the construction and\r\noperation of the canal are granted. Provision is made for the use of\r\nmilitary force and the building of fortifications by the United States\r\nfor the protection of the transit. In other details, particularly as\r\nto the acquisition of the interests of the New Panama Canal Company\r\nand the Panama Railway by the United States and the condemnation of\r\nprivate property for the uses of the canal, the stipulations of the\r\nHay-Herran treaty are closely followed, while the compensation to be\r\ngiven for these enlarged grants remains the same, being ten millions\r\nof dollars payable on exchange of ratifications; and, beginning nine\r\nyears from that date, an annual payment of $250,000 during the life of\r\nthe convention.\r\n\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n      WHITE HOUSE,\r\n  _December 7, 1903_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, COMMUNICATED TO THE\r\nTWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS ON JANUARY 4, 1904\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nI lay before the Congress for its information a statement of my action\r\nup to this time in executing the act entitled “An act to provide for\r\nthe construction of a canal connecting the waters of the Atlantic and\r\nPacific Oceans,” approved June 28, 1902.\r\n\r\nBy the said act the President was authorized to secure for the United\r\nStates the property of the Panama Canal Company and the perpetual\r\ncontrol of a strip six miles wide across the Isthmus of Panama. It was\r\nfurther provided that “should the President be unable to obtain for\r\nthe United States a satisfactory title to the property of the New\r\nPanama Canal Company and the control of the necessary territory of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia ... within a reasonable time and upon reasonable\r\nterms, then the President” should endeavor to provide for a canal\r\nby the Nicaragua route. The language quoted defines with exactness\r\nand precision what was to be done, and what as a matter of fact has\r\nbeen done. The President was authorized to go to the Nicaragua route\r\nonly if within a reasonable time he could not obtain “control of the\r\nnecessary territory of the Republic of Colombia.” This control has now\r\nbeen obtained; the provision of the act has been complied with; it is\r\nno longer possible under existing legislation to go to the Nicaragua\r\nroute as an alternative.\r\n\r\nThis act marked the climax of the effort on the part of the United\r\nStates to secure, so far as legislation was concerned, an interoceanic\r\ncanal across the Isthmus. The effort to secure a treaty for this\r\npurpose with one of the Central American republics did not stand on\r\nthe same footing with the effort to secure a treaty under any ordinary\r\nconditions. The proper position for the United States to assume in\r\nreference to this canal, and therefore to the governments of the\r\nIsthmus, had been clearly set forth by Secretary Cass in 1858. In\r\nmy Annual Message I have already quoted what Secretary Cass said;\r\nbut I repeat the quotation here, because the principle it states is\r\nfundamental:\r\n\r\n  While the rights of sovereignty of the States occupying this region\r\n  (Central America) should always be respected, we shall expect that\r\n  these rights be exercised in a spirit befitting the occasion and the\r\n  wants and circumstances that have arisen. Sovereignty has its duties\r\n  as well as its rights, and none of these local governments, even if\r\n  administered with more regard to the just demands of other nations\r\n  than they have been, would be permitted, in a spirit of Eastern\r\n  isolation, to close the gates of intercourse on the great highways\r\n  of the world, and justify the act by the pretension that these\r\n  avenues of trade and travel belong to them and that they choose to\r\n  shut them, or, what is almost equivalent, to encumber them with such\r\n  unjust relations as would prevent their general use.\r\n\r\nThe principle thus enunciated by Secretary Cass was sound then and it\r\nis sound now. The United States has taken the position that no other\r\ngovernment is to build the canal. In 1889, when France proposed to\r\ncome to the aid of the French Panama Company by guaranteeing their\r\nbonds, the Senate of the United States in executive session, with only\r\nsome three votes dissenting, passed a resolution as follows:\r\n\r\n  That the Government of the United States will look with serious\r\n  concern and disapproval upon any connection of any European\r\n  government with the construction or control of any ship canal across\r\n  the Isthmus of Darien or across Central America, and must regard\r\n  any such connection or control as injurious to the just rights and\r\n  interests of the United States and as a menace to their welfare.\r\n\r\nUnder the Hay-Pauncefote treaty it was explicitly provided that the\r\nUnited States should control, police, and protect the canal which was\r\nto be built, keeping it open for the vessels of all nations on equal\r\nterms. The United States thus assumed the position of guarantor of the\r\ncanal and of its peaceful use by all the world. The guarantee included\r\nas a matter of course the building of the canal. The enterprise was\r\nrecognized as responding to an international need; and it would be\r\nthe veriest travesty on right and justice to treat the governments in\r\npossession of the Isthmus as having the right, in the language of Mr.\r\nCass, “to close the gates of intercourse on the great highways of the\r\nworld, and justify the act by the pretension that these avenues of\r\ntrade and travel belong to them and that they choose to shut them.”\r\n\r\nWhen this Government submitted to Colombia the Hay-Herran treaty three\r\nthings were, therefore, already settled.\r\n\r\nOne was that the canal should be built. The time for delay, the time\r\nfor permitting the attempt to be made by private enterprise, the time\r\nfor permitting any government of anti-social spirit and of imperfect\r\ndevelopment to bar the work, was past. The United States had assumed\r\nin connection with the canal certain responsibilities not only to its\r\nown people, but to the civilized world, which imperatively demanded\r\nthat there should no longer be delay in beginning the work.\r\n\r\nSecond. While it was settled that the canal should be built without\r\nunnecessary or improper delay, it was no less clearly shown to be our\r\npurpose to deal not merely in a spirit of justice but in a spirit of\r\ngenerosity with the people through whose land we might build it. The\r\nHay-Herran treaty, if it erred at all, erred in the direction of an\r\novergenerosity toward the Colombian Government. In our anxiety to be\r\nfair we had gone to the very verge in yielding to a weak nation’s\r\ndemands what that nation was helplessly unable to enforce from us\r\nagainst our will. The only criticisms made upon the Administration for\r\nthe terms of the Hay-Herran treaty were for having granted too much\r\nto Colombia, not for failure to grant enough. Neither in the Congress\r\nnor in the public press, at the time that this treaty was formulated,\r\nwas there complaint that it did not in the fullest and amplest manner\r\nguarantee to Colombia everything that she could by any color of title\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nNor is the fact to be lost sight of that the rejected treaty, while\r\ngenerously responding to the pecuniary demands of Colombia, in\r\nother respects merely provided for the construction of the canal in\r\nconformity with the express requirements of the act of the Congress\r\nof June 28, 1902. By that act, as heretofore quoted, the President\r\nwas authorized to acquire from Colombia, for the purposes of the\r\ncanal, “perpetual control” of a certain strip of land; and it was\r\nexpressly required that the “control” thus to be obtained should\r\ninclude “jurisdiction” to make police and sanitary regulations and\r\nto establish such judicial tribunals as might be agreed on for\r\ntheir enforcement. These were conditions precedent prescribed by\r\nthe Congress; and for their fulfilment suitable stipulations were\r\nembodied in the treaty. It has been stated in public prints that\r\nColombia objected to these stipulations, on the ground that they\r\ninvolved a relinquishment of her “sovereignty”; but in the light\r\nof what has taken place, this alleged objection must be considered\r\nas an afterthought. In reality, the treaty, instead of requiring a\r\ncession of Colombia’s sovereignty over the canal strip, expressly\r\nacknowledged, confirmed, and preserved her sovereignty over it. The\r\ntreaty in this respect simply proceeded on the lines on which all the\r\nnegotiations leading up to the present situation have been conducted.\r\nIn those negotiations the exercise by the United States, subject\r\nto the paramount rights of the local sovereign, of a substantial\r\ncontrol over the canal and the immediately adjacent territory, has\r\nbeen treated as a fundamental part of any arrangement that might\r\nbe made. It has formed an essential feature of all our plans, and\r\nits necessity is fully recognized in the Hay-Pauncefote treaty.\r\nThe Congress, in providing that such control should be secured,\r\nadopted no new principle, but only incorporated in its legislation\r\na condition the importance and propriety of which were universally\r\nrecognized. During all the years of negotiation and discussion that\r\npreceded the conclusion of the Hay-Herran treaty, Colombia never\r\nintimated that the requirement by the United States of control over\r\nthe canal strip would render unattainable the construction of a\r\ncanal by way of the Isthmus of Panama; nor were we advised, during\r\nthe months when legislation of 1902 was pending before the Congress,\r\nthat the terms which it embodied would render negotiations with\r\nColombia impracticable. It is plain that no nation could construct\r\nand guarantee the neutrality of the canal with a less degree of\r\ncontrol than was stipulated for in the Hay-Herran treaty. A refusal\r\nto grant such degree of control was necessarily a refusal to make any\r\npracticable treaty at all. Such refusal therefore squarely raised\r\nthe question whether Colombia was entitled to bar the transit of the\r\nworlds traffic across the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nThat the canal itself was eagerly demanded by the people of the\r\nlocality through which it was to pass, and that the people of this\r\nlocality no less eagerly longed for its construction under American\r\ncontrol, are shown by the unanimity of action in the new Panama\r\nRepublic. Furthermore, Colombia, after having rejected the treaty in\r\nspite of our protests and warnings when it was in her power to accept\r\nit, has since shown the utmost eagerness to accept the same treaty\r\nif only the status quo could be restored. One of the men standing\r\nhighest in the official circles of Colombia, on November 6, addressed\r\nthe American minister at Bogota, saying that if the Government of the\r\nUnited States would land troops to preserve Colombian sovereignty and\r\nthe transit, the Colombian Government would “declare martial law;\r\nand, by virtue of vested constitutional authority, when public order\r\nis disturbed, [would] approve by decree the ratification of the canal\r\ntreaty as signed; or, if the Government of the United States prefers,\r\n[would] call extra session of the Congress—with new and friendly\r\nmembers—next May to approve the treaty.” Having these facts in view,\r\nthere is no shadow of question that the Government of the United\r\nStates proposed a treaty which was not merely just, but generous to\r\nColombia, which our people regarded as erring, if at all, on the side\r\nof overgenerosity; which was hailed with delight by the people of\r\nthe immediate locality through which the canal was to pass, who were\r\nmost concerned as to the new order of things, and which the Colombian\r\nauthorities now recognize as being so good that they are willing to\r\npromise its unconditional ratification if only we will desert those\r\nwho have shown themselves our friends and restore to those who have\r\nshown themselves unfriendly the power to undo what they did. I pass\r\nby the question as to what assurance we have that they would now\r\nkeep their pledge and not again refuse to ratify the treaty if they\r\nhad the power; for, of course, I will not for one moment discuss the\r\npossibility of the United States committing an act of such baseness as\r\nto abandon the new Republic of Panama.\r\n\r\nThird. Finally the Congress definitely settled where the canal was to\r\nbe built. It was provided that a treaty should be made for building\r\nthe canal across the Isthmus of Panama; and if, after reasonable\r\ntime, it proved impossible to secure such treaty, that then we should\r\ngo to Nicaragua. The treaty has been made; for it needs no argument\r\nto show that the intent of the Congress was to ensure a canal across\r\nPanama, and that whether the republic granting the title was called\r\nNew Granada, Colombia, or Panama mattered not one whit. As events\r\nturned out, the question of “reasonable time” did not enter into the\r\nmatter at all. Although, as the months went by, it became increasingly\r\nimprobable that the Colombian Congress would ratify the treaty or\r\ntake steps which would be equivalent thereto, yet all chance for such\r\naction on their part did not vanish until the Congress closed at the\r\nend of October; and within three days thereafter the revolution in\r\nPanama had broken out. Panama became an independent state, and the\r\ncontrol of the territory necessary for building the canal then became\r\nobtainable. The condition under which alone we could have gone to\r\nNicaragua thereby became impossible of fulfilment. If the pending\r\ntreaty with Panama should not be ratified by the Senate this would\r\nnot alter the fact that we could not go to Nicaragua. The Congress\r\nhas decided the route, and there is no alternative under existing\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nWhen in August it began to appear probable that the Colombian\r\nLegislature would not ratify the treaty, it became incumbent upon me\r\nto consider well what the situation was and to be ready to advise the\r\nCongress as to what were the various alternatives of action open to\r\nus. There were several possibilities. One was that Colombia would at\r\nthe last moment see the unwisdom of her position. That there might\r\nbe nothing omitted, Secretary Hay, through the minister at Bogota,\r\nrepeatedly warned Colombia that grave consequences might follow from\r\nher rejection of the treaty. Although it was a constantly diminishing\r\nchance, yet the possibility of ratification did not wholly pass away\r\nuntil the close of the session of the Colombian Congress.\r\n\r\nA second alternative was that by the close of the session on the last\r\nday of October, without the ratification of the treaty by Colombia\r\nand without any steps taken by Panama, the American Congress on\r\nassembling early in November would be confronted with a situation in\r\nwhich there had been a failure to come to terms as to building the\r\ncanal along the Panama route, and yet there had not been a lapse of a\r\nreasonable time—using the word reasonable in any proper sense—such as\r\nwould justify the Administration going to the Nicaragua route. This\r\nsituation seemed on the whole the most likely, and as a matter of fact\r\nI had made the original draft of my Message to the Congress with a\r\nview to its existence.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of eminent international jurists that in view of\r\nthe fact that the great design of our guarantee under the treaty of\r\n1846 was to dedicate the Isthmus to the purposes of interoceanic\r\ntransit, and above all to secure the construction of an interoceanic\r\ncanal, Colombia could not under existing conditions refuse to enter\r\ninto a proper arrangement with the United States to that end, without\r\nviolating the spirit and substantially repudiating the obligations of\r\na treaty the full benefits of which she had enjoyed for over fifty\r\nyears. My intention was to consult the Congress as to whether under\r\nsuch circumstances it would not be proper to announce that the canal\r\nwas to be dug forthwith; that we would give the terms that we had\r\noffered and no others; and that if such terms were not agreed to we\r\nwould enter into an arrangement with Panama direct, or take what other\r\nsteps were needful in order to begin the enterprise.\r\n\r\nA third possibility was that the people of the Isthmus, who had\r\nformerly constituted an independent state, and who until recently\r\nwere united to Colombia only by a loose tie of federal relationship,\r\nmight take the protection of their own vital interests into their own\r\nhands, reassert their former rights, declare their independence upon\r\njust grounds, and establish a government competent and willing to do\r\nits share in this great work for civilization. This third possibility\r\nis what actually occurred. Every one knew that it was a possibility,\r\nbut it was not until toward the end of October that it appeared to\r\nbe an imminent probability. Although the Administration, of course,\r\nhad special means of knowledge, no such means were necessary in order\r\nto appreciate the possibility, and toward the end the likelihood, of\r\nsuch a revolutionary outbreak and of its success. It was a matter\r\nof common notoriety. Quotations from the daily papers could be\r\nindefinitely multiplied to show this state of affairs; a very few\r\nwill suffice. From Costa Rica on August 31 a special was sent to the\r\nWashington “Post,” running as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                  SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA,\r\n                                                  _August 31_\r\n\r\n  Travelers from Panama report the Isthmus alive with fires of a new\r\n  revolution. It is inspired, it is believed, by men who, in Panama\r\n  and Colon, have systematically engendered the pro-American feeling\r\n  to secure the building of the Isthmian Canal by the United States.\r\n\r\n  The Indians have risen, and the late followers of Gen. Benjamin\r\n  Herrera are mustering in the mountain villages, preparatory to\r\n  joining in an organized revolt, caused by the rejection of the canal\r\n  treaty.\r\n\r\n  Hundreds of stacks of arms, confiscated by the Colombian Government\r\n  at the close of the late revolution, have reappeared from some\r\n  mysterious source, and thousands of rifles that look suspiciously\r\n  like the Mausers the United States captured in Cuba are issuing to\r\n  the gathering forces from central points of distribution. With the\r\n  arms goes ammunition, fresh from factories, showing the movement is\r\n  not spasmodic, but is carefully planned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The government forces in Panama and Colon, numbering less than\r\n  1,500 men, are reported to be a little more than friendly to the\r\n  revolutionary spirit. They have been ill paid since the revolution\r\n  closed, and their only hope of prompt payment is another war.\r\n\r\n  General Huertes, commander of the forces, who is ostensibly loyal\r\n  to the Bogota Government, is said to be secretly friendly to the\r\n  proposed revolution. At least, all his personal friends are open\r\n  in denunciation of the Bogota Government and the failure of the\r\n  Colombian Congress to ratify the canal treaty.\r\n\r\n  The consensus of opinion gathered from late arrivals from the\r\n  Isthmus is that the revolution is coming, and that it will succeed.\r\n\r\nA special despatch to the Washington “Post,” under date of New York,\r\nSeptember 1, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n  B. G. Duque, editor and proprietor of the “Panama Star and Herald,”\r\n  a resident of the Isthmus during the past twenty-seven years, who\r\n  arrived to-day in New York, declared that if the canal treaty fell\r\n  through a revolution would be likely to follow.\r\n\r\n  “There is a very strong feeling in Panama,” said Mr. Duque, “that\r\n  Colombia, in negotiating the sale of a canal concession in Panama,\r\n  is looking for profits that might just as well go to Panama herself.\r\n\r\n  “The Colombian Government, only the other day, suppressed a\r\n  newspaper that dared to speak of independence for Panama. A while\r\n  ago there was a secret plan afoot to cut loose from Colombia and\r\n  seek the protection of the United States.”\r\n\r\nIn the New York “Herald” of September 10 the following statement\r\nappeared:\r\n\r\n  Representatives of strong interests on the Isthmus of Panama, who\r\n  make their headquarters in this city, are considering a plan of\r\n  action to be undertaken in co-operation with men of similar views in\r\n  Panama and Colon to bring about a revolution and form an independent\r\n  government in Panama opposed to that in Bogota.\r\n\r\n  There is much indignation on the Isthmus on account of the failure\r\n  of the canal treaty, which is ascribed to the authorities at Bogota.\r\n  This opinion is believed to be shared by a majority of the Isthmians\r\n  of all shades of political belief, and they think it is to their\r\n  best interest for a new republic to be formed on the Isthmus,\r\n  which may negotiate directly with the United States a new treaty\r\n  which will permit the digging of the Panama Canal under favorable\r\n  conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the New York “Times,” under date of September 13, there appeared\r\nfrom Bogota the following statement:\r\n\r\n  A proposal made by Señor Perez y Sotos to ask the Executive to\r\n  appoint an anti-secessionist governor in Panama has been approved\r\n  by the Senate. Speakers in the Senate said that Señor Obaldía, who\r\n  was recently appointed Governor of Panama, and who is favorable to\r\n  a canal treaty, was a menace to the national integrity. Senator\r\n  Marroquín protested against the action of the Senate.\r\n\r\n  President Marroquín succeeded later in calming the Congressmen.\r\n  It appears that he was able to give them satisfactory reasons for\r\n  Governor Obaldía’s appointment. He appears to realize the imminent\r\n  peril of the Isthmus of Panama declaring its independence.\r\n\r\n  Señor Deroux, representative for a Panama constituency, recently\r\n  delivered a sensational speech in the House. Among other things he\r\n  said:\r\n\r\n    “In Panama the bishops, governors, magistrates, military\r\n    chiefs, and their subordinates have been and are foreign to\r\n    the department. It seems that the government, with surprising\r\n    tenacity, wishes to exclude the Isthmus from all participation in\r\n    public affairs. As regards international dangers in the Isthmus,\r\n    all I can say is that if these dangers exist they are due to the\r\n    conduct of the national government, which is in the direction of\r\n    reaction.\r\n\r\n    “If the Colombian Government will not take action with a view to\r\n    preventing disaster, the responsibility will rest with it alone.”\r\n\r\nIn the New York “Herald” of October 26 it was reported that a\r\nrevolutionary expedition of about 70 men had actually landed on the\r\nIsthmus. In the Washington “Post” of October 29 it was reported from\r\nPanama that in view of the impending trouble on the Isthmus the Bogota\r\nGovernment had gathered troops in sufficient numbers to at once put\r\ndown an attempt at secession. In the New York “Herald” of October 30\r\nit was announced from Panama that Bogota was hurrying troops to the\r\nIsthmus to put down the projected revolt. In the New York “Herald” of\r\nNovember 2 it was announced that in Bogota the Congress had indorsed\r\nthe energetic measures taken to meet the situation on the Isthmus and\r\nthat 6,000 men were about to be sent thither.\r\n\r\nQuotations like the above could be multiplied indefinitely. Suffice it\r\nto say that it was notorious that revolutionary trouble of a serious\r\nnature was impending upon the Isthmus. But it was not necessary to\r\nrely exclusively upon such general means of information. On October\r\n15 Commander Hubbard, of the navy, notified the Navy Department\r\nthat, though things were quiet on the Isthmus, a revolution had\r\nbroken out in the State of Cauca. On October 16, at the request of\r\nLieutenant-General Young, I saw Capt. C. B. Humphrey and Lieut.\r\nGrayson Mallet-Prevost Murphy, who had just returned from a four\r\nmonths’ tour through the northern portions of Venezuela and Colombia.\r\nThey stopped in Panama on their return in the latter part of\r\nSeptember. At the time they were sent down there had been no thought\r\nof their going to Panama, and their visit to the Isthmus was but\r\nan unpremeditated incident of their return journey; nor had they\r\nbeen spoken to by any one at Washington regarding the possibility\r\nof a revolt. Until they landed at Colon they had no knowledge that\r\na revolution was impending, save what they had gained from the\r\nnewspapers. What they saw in Panama so impressed them that they\r\nreported thereon to Lieutenant-General Young, according to his\r\nmemorandum—\r\n\r\n\r\nthat while on the Isthmus they became satisfied beyond question\r\nthat, owing largely to the dissatisfaction because of the failure\r\nof Colombia to ratify the Hay-Herran treaty, a revolutionary party\r\nwas in course of organization having for its object the separation\r\nof the State of Panama from Colombia, the leader being Dr. Richard\r\nArango, a former governor of Panama; that when they were on the\r\nIsthmus arms and ammunition were being smuggled into the city of Colon\r\nin piano boxes, merchandise crates, etc., the small arms received\r\nbeing principally the Gras French rifle, the Remington, and the\r\nMauser; that nearly every citizen in Panama had some sort of rifle\r\nor gun in his possession, with ammunition therefor; that in the city\r\nof Panama there had been organized a fire brigade which was really\r\nintended for a revolutionary military organization; that there were\r\nrepresentatives of the revolutionary organization at all-important\r\npoints on the Isthmus; that in Panama, Colon, and the other principal\r\nplaces of the Isthmus police forces had been organized which were in\r\nreality revolutionary forces; that the people on the Isthmus seemed\r\nto be unanimous in their sentiment against the Bogota Government, and\r\ntheir disgust over the failure of that government to ratify the treaty\r\nproviding for the construction of the canal, and that a revolution\r\nmight be expected immediately upon the adjournment of the Colombian\r\nCongress without ratification of the treaty.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General Young regarded their report as of such\r\nimportance as to make it advisable that I should personally see\r\nthese officers. They told me what they had already reported to the\r\nLieutenant-General, adding that on the Isthmus the excitement\r\nwas seething, and that the Colombian troops were reported to be\r\ndisaffected. In response to a question of mine they informed me that\r\nit was the general belief that the revolution might break out at any\r\nmoment, and if it did not happen before, would doubtless take place\r\nimmediately after the closing of the Colombian Congress (at the end of\r\nOctober) if the canal treaty were not ratified. They were certain that\r\nthe revolution would occur, and before leaving the Isthmus had made\r\ntheir own reckoning as to the time, which they had set down as being\r\nprobably from three to four weeks after their leaving. The reason they\r\nset this as the probable inside limit of time was that they reckoned\r\nthat it would be at least three or four weeks—say not until October\r\n20—before a sufficient quantity of arms and munitions would have been\r\nlanded.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these facts I directed the Navy Department to issue\r\ninstructions such as would ensure our having ships within easy reach\r\nof the Isthmus in the event of need arising. Orders were given on\r\nOctober 19 to the _Boston_ to proceed to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua;\r\nto the _Dixie_ to prepare to sail from League Island; and to the\r\n_Atlanta_ to proceed to Guantanamo. On October 30 the _Nashville_\r\nwas ordered to proceed to Colon. On November 2, when, the Colombian\r\nCongress having adjourned, it was evident that the outbreak was\r\nimminent, and when it was announced that both sides were making ready\r\nforces whose meeting would mean bloodshed and disorder, the Colombian\r\ntroops having been embarked on vessels, the following instructions\r\nwere sent to the commanders of the _Boston_, _Nashville_, and _Dixie_:\r\n\r\n  Maintain free and uninterrupted transit. If interruption is\r\n  threatened by armed force, occupy the line of railroad. Prevent\r\n  landing of any armed force with hostile intent, either government or\r\n  insurgent, at any point within 50 miles of Panama. Government force\r\n  reported approaching the Isthmus in vessels. Prevent their landing\r\n  if, in your judgment, the landing would precipitate a conflict.\r\n\r\nThese orders were delivered in pursuance of the policy on which our\r\nGovernment had repeatedly acted. This policy was exhibited in the\r\nfollowing orders, given under somewhat similar circumstances last\r\nyear, and the year before, and the year before that. The first two\r\ntelegrams are from the Department of State to the consul at Panama:\r\n\r\n                                                        JULY _25, 1900_\r\n\r\n  You are directed to protest against any act of hostility which may\r\n  involve or imperil the safe and peaceful transit of persons or\r\n  property across the Isthmus of Panama. The bombardment of Panama\r\n  would have this effect, and the United States must insist upon the\r\n  neutrality of the Isthmus as guaranteed by the treaty.\r\n\r\n                                                    NOVEMBER _20, 1901_\r\n\r\n  Notify all parties molesting or interfering with free transit\r\n  across the Isthmus that such interference must cease and that the\r\n  United States will prevent the interruption of traffic upon the\r\n  railroad. Consult with captain of the _Iowa_, who will be instructed\r\n  to land marines, if necessary, for the protection of the railroad,\r\n  in accordance with the treaty rights and obligations of the United\r\n  States. Desirable to avoid bloodshed, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe next three telegrams are from and to the Secretary of the Navy:\r\n\r\n                                                   SEPTEMBER _12, 1902_\r\n\r\n  RANGER, _Panama_:\r\n\r\n  United States guarantees perfect neutrality of Isthmus and that a\r\n  free transit from sea to sea be not interrupted or embarrassed....\r\n  Any transportation of troops which might contravene these provisions\r\n  of treaty should not be sanctioned by you nor should use of road be\r\n  permitted which might convert the line of transit into theatre of\r\n  hostility.\r\n\r\n                                                                 MOODY.\r\n\r\n                                                 COLON,\r\n                                                   _September 20, 1902_\r\n\r\n  SECRETARY NAVY, _Washington_:\r\n\r\n  Everything is conceded. The United States guards and guarantees\r\n  traffic and the line of transit. To-day I permitted the exchange of\r\n  Colombian troops from Panama to Colon, about 1,000 men each way, the\r\n  troops without arms in train guarded by American naval force in the\r\n  same manner as other passengers; arms and ammunition in separate\r\n  train, guarded also by naval force in the same manner as other\r\n  freight.\r\n\r\n                                                                MCLEAN.\r\n\r\n                                                      PANAMA,\r\n                                                      _October 3, 1902_\r\n\r\n  SECRETARY NAVY,\r\n        _Washington, D. C._:\r\n\r\n  Have sent this communication to the American consul at Panama:\r\n\r\n  “Inform Governor while trains running under United States protection\r\n  I must decline transportation any combatants, ammunition, arms,\r\n  which might cause interruption traffic or convert line of transit\r\n  into theatre hostilities.”\r\n\r\n                                                                 CASEY.\r\n\r\nOn November 3 Commander Hubbard responded to the above-quoted telegram\r\nof November 2, 1903, saying that before the telegram had been received\r\n400 Colombian troops from Cartagena had landed at Colon; that there\r\nhad been no revolution on the Isthmus, but that the situation was most\r\ncritical if the revolutionary leaders should act. On this same date\r\nthe Associated Press in Washington received a bulletin stating that\r\na revolutionary outbreak had occurred. When this was brought to the\r\nattention of the Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Loomis, he prepared\r\nthe following cablegram to the consul-general at Panama and the consul\r\nat Colon:\r\n\r\n  Uprising on Isthmus reported. Keep Department promptly and fully\r\n  informed.\r\n\r\nBefore this telegram was sent, however, one was received from Consul\r\nMalmros at Colon, running as follows:\r\n\r\n  Revolution imminent. Government force on the Isthmus about 500\r\n  men. Their official promised support revolution. Fire department,\r\n  Panama, 441, are well organized and favor revolution. Government\r\n  vessel, _Cartagena_, with about 400 men, arrived early to-day with\r\n  new commander-in-chief, Tobar. Was not expected until November 10.\r\n  Tobar’s arrival is not probable to stop revolution.\r\n\r\nThis cablegram was received at 2.35 P.M., and at 3.40 P.M. Mr. Loomis\r\nsent the telegram which he had already prepared to both Panama and\r\nColon. Apparently, however, the consul-general at Panama had not\r\nreceived the information embodied in the Associated Press bulletin,\r\nupon which the Assistant Secretary of State based his dispatch; for\r\nhis answer was that there was no uprising, although the situation\r\nwas critical, this answer being received at 8.15 P.M. Immediately\r\nafterward he sent another dispatch, which was received at 9.50 P.M.,\r\nsaying that the uprising had occurred, and had been successful, with\r\nno bloodshed. The Colombian gunboat _Bogota_ next day began to shell\r\nthe city of Panama, with the result of killing one Chinaman. The\r\nconsul-general was directed to notify her to stop firing. Meanwhile,\r\non November 4, Commander Hubbard notified the Department that he had\r\nlanded a force to protect the lives and property of American citizens\r\nagainst the threats of the Colombian soldiery.\r\n\r\nBefore any step whatever had been taken by the United States troops\r\nto restore order, the commander of the newly landed Colombian troops\r\nhad indulged in wanton and violent threats against American citizens,\r\nwhich created serious apprehension. As Commander Hubbard reported in\r\nhis letter of November 5, this officer and his troops practically\r\nbegan war against the United States, and only the forbearance and\r\ncoolness of our officers and men prevented bloodshed. The letter of\r\nCommander Hubbard is of such interest that it deserves quotation in\r\nfull, and runs as follows:\r\n\r\n                              U. S. S. NASHVILLE, THIRD RATE,\r\n                              _Colon, U. S. Colombia, November 5, 1903_\r\n\r\n  SIR: Pending a complete report of the occurrences of the last\r\n  three days in Colon, Colombia, I most respectfully invite the\r\n  Department’s attention to those of the date of Wednesday, November\r\n  4, which amounted to practically the making of war against the\r\n  United States by the officer in command of the Colombian troops in\r\n  Colon. At 1 o’clock P.M. on that date I was summoned on shore by a\r\n  preconcerted signal, and on landing met the United States consul,\r\n  vice-consul, and Colonel Shaler, the general superintendent of the\r\n  Panama Railroad. The consul informed me that he had received notice\r\n  from the officer commanding the Colombian troops, Colonel Torres,\r\n  through the prefect of Colon, to the effect that if the Colombian\r\n  officers, Generals Tobal and Amaya, who had been seized in Panama on\r\n  the evening of the 3d of November by the Independents and held as\r\n  prisoners, were not released by 2 o’clock P.M., he, Torres, would\r\n  open fire on the town of Colon and kill every United States citizen\r\n  in the place, and my advice and action were requested. I advised\r\n  that all the United States citizens should take refuge in the shed\r\n  of the Panama Railroad Company, a stone building susceptible of\r\n  being put into good state for defence, and that I would immediately\r\n  land such body of men with extra arms for arming the citizens, as\r\n  the complement of the ship would permit. This was agreed to, and I\r\n  immediately returned on board, arriving at 1.15 P.M. The order for\r\n  landing was immediately given, and at 1.30 P.M. the boats left the\r\n  ship with a party of 42 men under the command of Lieut.-Commander\r\n  H. M. Witzel, with Midshipman J. P. Jackson as second in command.\r\n  Time being pressing I gave verbal orders to Mr. Witzel to take the\r\n  building above referred to, to put it into the best state of defence\r\n  possible, and protect the lives of the citizens assembled there—not\r\n  firing unless fired upon. The women and children took refuge on\r\n  the German steamer _Marcomania_ and Panama Railroad steamer _City\r\n  of Washington_, both ready to haul out from dock if necessary. The\r\n  _Nashville_ I got under way and patrolled with her along the water\r\n  front close in and ready to use either small-arm or shrapnel fire.\r\n  The Colombians surrounded the building of the railroad company\r\n  almost immediately after we had taken possession, and for about\r\n  one and a half hours their attitude was most threatening, it being\r\n  seemingly their purpose to provoke an attack. Happily our men were\r\n  cool and steady, and, while the tension was very great, no shot was\r\n  fired. At about 3.15 P.M. Colonel Torres came into the building for\r\n  an interview and expressed himself as most friendly to Americans,\r\n  claiming that the whole affair was a misapprehension and that he\r\n  would like to send the alcalde of Colon to Panama to see General\r\n  Tobal and have him direct the discontinuance of the show of force.\r\n  A special train was furnished and safe conduct guaranteed. At about\r\n  5.30 P.M. Colonel Torres made the proposition of withdrawing his\r\n  troops to Monkey Hill, if I would withdraw the _Nashville’s_ force\r\n  and leave the town in possession of the police until the return of\r\n  the alcalde on the morning of the 5th. After an interview with the\r\n  United States consul and Colonel Shaler as to the probability of\r\n  good faith in the matter, I decided to accept the proposition and\r\n  brought my men on board, the disparity in numbers between my force\r\n  and that of the Colombians, nearly ten to one, making me desirous of\r\n  avoiding a conflict so long as the object in view, the protection of\r\n  American citizens, was not imperiled.\r\n\r\n  I am positive that the determined attitude of our men, their\r\n  coolness and evident intention of standing their ground, had a most\r\n  salutary and decisive effect on the immediate situation, and was the\r\n  initial step in the ultimate abandoning of Colon by these troops and\r\n  their return to Cartagena the following day. Lieutenant-Commander\r\n  Witzel is entitled to much praise for his admirable work in command\r\n  on the spot.\r\n\r\n  I feel that I can not sufficiently strongly represent to the\r\n  Department the grossness of this outrage and the insult to our\r\n  dignity, even apart from the savagery of the threat.\r\n\r\n                           Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                         JOHN HUBBARD,\r\n                                             _Commander, U.

I have the honor to make the following report of the\r\n  occurrences which took place at Colon and Panama in the interval\r\n  between the arrival of the _Nashville_ at Colon on the evening of\r\n  November 2, 1903, and the evening of November 5, 1903, when by the\r\n  arrival of the U. S. S. _Dixie_ at Colon I was relieved as senior\r\n  officer by Commander F. H. Delano, U. S. Navy.\r\n\r\n  2. At the time of the arrival of the _Nashville_ at Colon at 5.30\r\n  P.M. on November 2 everything on the Isthmus was quiet. There was\r\n  talk of proclaiming the independence of Panama, but no definite\r\n  action had been taken and there had been no disturbance of peace and\r\n  order. At daylight on the morning of November 3 it was found that a\r\n  vessel which had come in during the night was the Colombian gunboat\r\n  _Cartagena_ carrying between 400 and 500 troops. I had her boarded\r\n  and learned that these troops were for the garrison at Panama.\r\n  Inasmuch as the Independent party had not acted and the Government\r\n  of Colombia was at the time in undisputed control of the Province of\r\n  Panama, I did not feel, in the absence of any instructions, that I\r\n  was justified in preventing the landing of these troops, and at 8.30\r\n  o’clock they were disembarked. The commanding officers, Generals\r\n  Amaya and Tobal, with four others, immediately went over to Panama\r\n  to make arrangements for receiving and quartering their troops,\r\n  leaving the command in charge of an officer whom I later learned\r\n  to be Colonel Torres. The Department’s message addressed to the\r\n  care of the United States consul I received at 10.30 A.M.; it was\r\n  delivered to one of the ship’s boats while I was at the consul’s and\r\n  not to the consul as addressed. The message was said to have been\r\n  received at the cable office at 9.30 A.M. Immediately on deciphering\r\n  the message I went on shore to see what arrangements the railroad\r\n  company had made for the transportation of these troops to Panama,\r\n  and learned that the company would not transport them except on\r\n  request of the Governor of Panama, and that the prefect at Colon\r\n  and the officer left in command of the troops had been so notified\r\n  by the general superintendent of the Panama Railroad Company. I\r\n  remained at the company’s office until it was sure that no action\r\n  on my part would be needed to prevent the transportation of the\r\n  troops that afternoon, when I returned on board and cabled the\r\n  Department the situation of affairs. At about 5.30 P.M. I again went\r\n  on shore, and received notice from the general superintendent of the\r\n  railroad that he had received the request for the transportation\r\n  of the troops and that they would leave on the 8 A.M. train on the\r\n  following day. I immediately went to see the general superintendent,\r\n  and learned that it had just been announced that a provisional\r\n  government had been established at Panama—that Generals Amaya and\r\n  Tobal, the Governor of Panama, and four officers, who had gone to\r\n  Panama in the morning, had been seized and were held as prisoners;\r\n  that they had an organized force of 1,500 troops and wished the\r\n  government troops in Colon to be sent over. This I declined to\r\n  permit, and verbally prohibited the general superintendent from\r\n  giving transportation to the troops of either party.\r\n\r\n  It being then late in the evening, I sent early in the morning of\r\n  November 4 written notification to the general superintendent of\r\n  the Panama Railroad, to the prefect of Colon, and to the officer\r\n  left in command of the Colombian troops, later ascertained to be\r\n  Colonel Torres, that I had prohibited the transportation of troops\r\n  in either direction, in order to preserve the free and uninterrupted\r\n  transit of the Isthmus. Copies of these letters are hereto appended;\r\n  also copy of my notification to the consul. Except to a few people,\r\n  nothing was known in Colon of the proceedings in Panama until the\r\n  arrival of the train at 10.45 on the morning of the 4th. Some\r\n  propositions were, I was later told, made to Colonel Torres by\r\n  the representatives of the new Government at Colon, with a view\r\n  to inducing him to re-embark in the _Cartagena_ and return to the\r\n  port of Cartagena, and it was in answer to this proposition that\r\n  Colonel Torres made the threat and took the action reported in my\r\n  letter No. 96, of November 5, 1903. The _Cartagena_ left the port\r\n  just after the threat was made, and I did not deem it expedient to\r\n  attempt to detain her, as such action would certainly, in the then\r\n  state of affairs, have precipitated a conflict on shore which I\r\n  was not prepared to meet. It is my understanding that she returned\r\n  to Cartagena. After the withdrawal of the Colombian troops on the\r\n  evening of November 4, and the return of the _Nashville’s_ force on\r\n  board, as reported in my letter No. 96, there was no disturbance\r\n  on shore, and the night passed quietly. On the morning of the 5th\r\n  I discovered that the commander of the Colombian troops had not\r\n  withdrawn so far from the town as he had agreed, but was occupying\r\n  buildings near the outskirts of the town. I immediately inquired\r\n  into the matter and learned that he had some trivial excuse for\r\n  not carrying out his agreement, and also that it was his intention\r\n  to occupy Colon again on the arrival of the alcalde due at 10.45\r\n  A.M., unless General Tobal sent word by the alcalde that he,\r\n  Colonel Torres, should withdraw. That General Tobal had declined\r\n  to give any instructions I was cognizant of, and the situation at\r\n  once became quite as serious as on the day previous. I immediately\r\n  landed an armed force, reoccupied the same building; also landed\r\n  two 1-pounders and mounted them on platform cars behind protection\r\n  of cotton bales, and then in company with the United States consul\r\n  had an interview with Colonel Torres, in the course of which I\r\n  informed him that I had relanded my men because he had not kept\r\n  his agreement; that I had no interest in the affairs of either\r\n  party; that my attitude was strictly neutral; that the troops of\r\n  neither side should be transported; that my sole purpose in landing\r\n  was to protect the lives and property of American citizens if\r\n  threatened, as they had been threatened, and to maintain the free\r\n  and uninterrupted transit of the Isthmus, and that purpose I should\r\n  maintain by force if necessary. I also strongly advised that in the\r\n  interests of peace, and to prevent the possibility of a conflict\r\n  that could not but be regrettable, he should carry out his agreement\r\n  of the previous evening and withdraw to Monkey Hill.\r\n\r\n  Colonel Torres’s only reply was that it was unhealthy at Monkey\r\n  Hill, a reiteration of his love of Americans, and persistence in\r\n  his intention to occupy Colon, should General Tobal not give him\r\n  directions to the contrary.\r\n\r\n  On the return of the alcalde at about 11 A.M. the Colombian troops\r\n  marched into Colon, but did not assume the threatening demeanor\r\n  of the previous day. The American women and children again went\r\n  on board the _Marcomania_ and _City of Washington_, and through\r\n  the British vice-consul I offered protection to British subjects\r\n  as directed in the Department’s cablegram. A copy of the British\r\n  vice-consul’s acknowledgment is hereto appended. The _Nashville_ I\r\n  got under way as on the previous day and moved close in to protect\r\n  the water front. During the afternoon several propositions were made\r\n  to Colonel Torres by the representatives of the new government,\r\n  and he was finally persuaded by them to embark on the Royal Mail\r\n  steamer _Orinoco_ with all his troops and return to Cartagena. The\r\n  _Orinoco_ left her dock with the troops—474 all told—at 7.35 P.M.\r\n  The _Dixie_ arrived and anchored at 7.05 P.M., when I went on board\r\n  and acquainted the commanding officer with the situation. A portion\r\n  of the marine battalion was landed and the _Nashville’s_ force\r\n  withdrawn.\r\n\r\n  3. On the evening of November 4 Major William M. Black and Lieut.\r\n  Mark Brooke, Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, came to Colon from\r\n  Culebra and volunteered their services, which were accepted, and\r\n  they rendered very efficient help on the following day.\r\n\r\n  4. I beg to assure the Department that I had no part whatever in\r\n  the negotiations that were carried on between Colonel Torres and\r\n  the representatives of the provisional government; that I landed\r\n  an armed force only when the lives of American citizens were\r\n  threatened, and withdrew this force as soon as there seemed to be\r\n  no grounds for further apprehension of injury to American lives or\r\n  property; that I relanded an armed force because of the failure of\r\n  Colonel Torres to carry out his agreement to withdraw and announced\r\n  intention of returning, and that my attitude throughout was strictly\r\n  neutral as between the two parties, my only purpose being to\r\n  protect the lives and property of American citizens and to preserve\r\n  the free and uninterrupted transit of the Isthmus.\r\n\r\n                                   Very respectfully,\r\n                                   (Signed) JOHN HUBBARD,\r\n                                   _Commander, U. S. Navy, Commanding_.\r\n\r\n  THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY,\r\n        _Bureau of Navigation, Navy Department,\r\n               Washington, D. C._\r\n\r\nThis plain official account of the occurrences of November 4 shows\r\nthat, instead of there having been too much prevision by the American\r\nGovernment for the maintenance of order and the protection of life\r\nand property on the Isthmus, the orders for the movement of the\r\nAmerican warships had been too long delayed; so long, in fact, that\r\nthere were but forty-two marines and sailors available to land and\r\nprotect the lives of American men and women. It was only the coolness\r\nand gallantry with which this little band of men wearing the American\r\nuniform faced ten times their number of armed foes, bent on carrying\r\nout the atrocious threat of the Colombian commander, that prevented\r\na murderous catastrophe. At Panama, when the revolution broke out,\r\nthere was no American man-of-war and no American troops or sailors.\r\nAt Colon, Commander Hubbard acted with entire impartiality toward\r\nboth sides, preventing any movement, whether by the Colombians or\r\nthe Panamans, which would tend to produce bloodshed. On November 9\r\nhe prevented a body of the revolutionists from landing at Colon.\r\nThroughout he behaved in the most creditable manner. In the New\r\nYork “Evening Post,” under date of Panama, December 8, there is an\r\narticle from a special correspondent, which sets forth in detail the\r\nunbearable oppression of the Colombian Government in Panama. In this\r\narticle is an interesting interview with a native Panaman, which runs\r\nin part as follows:\r\n\r\n... We looked upon the building of the canal as a matter of life\r\nor death to us. We wanted that because it meant, with the United\r\nStates in control of it, peace and prosperity for us. President\r\nMarroquin appointed an Isthmian to be governor of Panama; and we\r\nlooked upon that as of happy augury. Soon we heard that the canal\r\ntreaty was not likely to be approved at Bogota; next we heard that our\r\nIsthmian Governor, Obaldía, who had scarcely assumed power, was to be\r\nsuperseded by a soldier from Bogota....\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that Colombia has drained us of in the way of\r\nrevenues, she did not bridge for us a single river, nor make a single\r\nroadway, nor erect a single college where our children could be\r\neducated, nor do anything at all to advance our industries.... Well,\r\nwhen the new generals came we seized them, arrested them, and the\r\ntown of Panama was in joy. Not a protest was made, except the shots\r\nfired from the Colombian gunboat _Bogota_, which killed one Chinese\r\nlying in his bed. We were willing to encounter the Colombian troops at\r\nColon and fight it out; but the commander of the United States cruiser\r\n_Nashville_ forbade Superintendent Shaler to allow the railroad to\r\ntransport troops for either party. That is our story.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI call especial attention to the concluding portion of this interview,\r\nwhich states the willingness of the Panama people to fight the\r\nColombian troops and the refusal of Commander Hubbard to permit them\r\nto use the railroad and therefore to get into a position where the\r\nfight could take place. It thus clearly appears that the fact that\r\nthere was no bloodshed on the Isthmus was directly due—and only\r\ndue—to the prompt and firm enforcement by the United States of its\r\ntraditional policy. During the past forty years revolutions and\r\nattempts at revolution have succeeded one another with monotonous\r\nregularity on the Isthmus, and again and again United States sailors\r\nand marines have been landed as they were landed in this instance\r\nand under similar instructions to protect the transit. One of these\r\nrevolutions resulted in three years of warfare; and the aggregate of\r\nbloodshed and misery caused by them has been incalculable. The fact\r\nthat in this last revolution not a life was lost, save that of the\r\nman killed by the shells of the Colombian gunboat, and no property\r\ndestroyed, was due to the action which I have described. We, in\r\neffect, policed the Isthmus in the interest of its inhabitants and\r\nof our own national needs, and for the good of the entire civilized\r\nworld. Failure to act as the Administration acted would have meant\r\ngreat waste of life, great suffering, great destruction of property;\r\nall of which was avoided by the firmness and prudence with which\r\nCommander Hubbard carried out his orders and prevented either party\r\nfrom attacking the other. Our action was for the peace both of\r\nColombia and of Panama. It is earnestly to be hoped that there will be\r\nno unwise conduct on our part which may encourage Colombia to embark\r\non a war which can not result in her regaining control of the Isthmus,\r\nbut which may cause much bloodshed and suffering.\r\n\r\nI hesitate to refer to the injurious insinuations which have been\r\nmade of complicity by this government in the revolutionary movement\r\nin Panama. They are as destitute of foundation as of propriety. The\r\nonly excuse for my mentioning them is the fear lest unthinking persons\r\nmight mistake for acquiescence the silence of mere self-respect.\r\nI think proper to say, therefore, that no one connected with this\r\nGovernment had any part in preparing, inciting, or encouraging\r\nthe late revolution on the Isthmus of Panama, and that save from\r\nthe reports of our military and naval officers, given above, no\r\none connected with this Government had any previous knowledge of\r\nthe revolution except such as was accessible to any person of\r\nordinary intelligence who read the newspapers and kept up a current\r\nacquaintance with public affairs.\r\n\r\nBy the unanimous action of its people, without the firing of a\r\nshot—with a unanimity hardly before recorded in any similar case—the\r\npeople of Panama declared themselves an independent republic. Their\r\nrecognition by this Government was based upon a state of facts in\r\nno way dependent for its justification upon our action in ordinary\r\ncases. I have not denied, nor do I wish to deny, either the validity\r\nor the propriety of the general rule that a new state should not be\r\nrecognized as independent till it has shown its ability to maintain\r\nits independence. This rule is derived from the principle of\r\nnon-intervention, and as a corollary of that principle has generally\r\nbeen observed by the United States. But, like the principle from which\r\nit is deduced, the rule is subject to exceptions; and there are in\r\nmy opinion clear and imperative reasons why a departure from it was\r\njustified and even required in the present instance. These reasons\r\nembrace, first, our treaty rights; second, our national interests and\r\nsafety; and, third, the interests of collective civilization.\r\n\r\nI have already adverted to the treaty of 1846, by the thirty-fifth\r\narticle of which the United States secured the right to a free and\r\nopen transit across the Isthmus of Panama, and to that end agreed to\r\nguarantee to New Granada her rights of sovereignty and property over\r\nthat territory. This article is sometimes discussed as if the latter\r\nguarantee constituted its sole object and bound the United States to\r\nprotect the sovereignty of New Granada against domestic revolution.\r\nNothing, however, could be more erroneous than this supposition. That\r\nour wise and patriotic ancestors, with all their dread of entangling\r\nalliances, would have entered into a treaty with New Granada solely\r\nor even primarily for the purpose of enabling that remnant of the\r\noriginal Republic of Colombia, then resolved into the States of New\r\nGranada, Venezuela, and Ecuador, to continue from Bogota to rule\r\nover the Isthmus of Panama, is a conception that would in itself be\r\nincredible, even if the contrary did not clearly appear. It is true\r\nthat since the treaty was made the United States has again and again\r\nbeen obliged forcibly to intervene for the preservation of order\r\nand the maintenance of an open transit, and that this intervention\r\nhas usually operated to the advantage of the titular Government of\r\nColombia, but it is equally true that the United States in intervening\r\nwith or without Colombia’s consent, for the protection of the transit,\r\nhas disclaimed any duty to defend the Colombian Government against\r\ndomestic insurrection or against the erection of an independent\r\ngovernment on the Isthmus of Panama. The attacks against which the\r\nUnited States engaged to protect New Granadian sovereignty were\r\nthose of foreign powers; but this engagement was only a means to the\r\naccomplishment of a yet more important end. The great design of the\r\narticle was to assure the dedication of the Isthmus to the purposes of\r\nfree and unobstructed interoceanic transit, the consummation of which\r\nwould be found in an interoceanic canal. To the accomplishment of this\r\nobject the Government of the United States had for years directed its\r\ndiplomacy. It occupied a place in the instructions to our delegates to\r\nthe Panama Congress during the Administration of John Quincy Adams. It\r\nformed the subject of a resolution of the Senate in 1835, and of the\r\nHouse of Representatives in 1839. In 1846 its importance had become\r\nstill more apparent by reason of the Mexican war. If the treaty of\r\n1846 did not in terms bind New Granada to grant reasonable concessions\r\nfor the construction of means of interoceanic communication, it was\r\nonly because it was not imagined that such concessions would ever\r\nbe withheld. As it was expressly agreed that the United States, in\r\nconsideration of its onerous guarantee of New Granadian sovereignty,\r\nshould possess the right of free and open transit on any modes of\r\ncommunication that might be constructed, the obvious intent of the\r\ntreaty rendered it unnecessary, if not superfluous, in terms to\r\nstipulate that permission for the construction of such modes of\r\ncommunication should not be denied.\r\n\r\nLong before the conclusion of the Hay-Herran treaty the course of\r\nevents had shown that a canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nOceans must be built by the United States or not at all. Experience\r\nhad demonstrated that private enterprise was utterly inadequate for\r\nthe purpose; and a fixed policy, declared by the United States on\r\nmany memorable occasions, and supported by the practically unanimous\r\nvoice of American opinion, had rendered it morally impossible that\r\nthe work should be undertaken by European powers, either singly or\r\nin combination. Such were the universally recognized conditions on\r\nwhich the legislation of the Congress was based, and on which the late\r\nnegotiations with Colombia were begun and concluded. Nevertheless,\r\nwhen the well-considered agreement was rejected by Colombia and the\r\nrevolution on the Isthmus ensued, one of Colombia’s first acts was to\r\ninvoke the intervention of the United States; nor does her invitation\r\nappear to have been confined to this Government alone. By a telegram\r\nfrom Mr. Beaupré, our minister at Bogota, of the 7th of November last,\r\nwe were informed that General Reyes would soon leave Panama invested\r\nwith full powers; that he had telegraphed the President of Mexico to\r\nask the Government of the United States and all countries represented\r\nat the Pan-American Conference “to aid Colombia to preserve her\r\nintegrity”; and that he had requested that the Government of the\r\nUnited States should meanwhile “preserve the neutrality and transit\r\nof the Isthmus” and should “not recognize the new government.” In\r\nanother telegram from Mr. Beaupré, which was sent later in the day,\r\nthis Government was asked whether it would take action “to maintain\r\nColombian right and sovereignty on the Isthmus in accordance with\r\narticle 35 [of] the treaty of 1846” in case the Colombian Government\r\nshould be “entirely unable to suppress the secession movement there.”\r\nHere was a direct solicitation to the United States to intervene for\r\nthe purpose of suppressing, contrary to the treaty of 1846 as this\r\nGovernment has uniformly construed it, a new revolt against Colombia’s\r\nauthority brought about by her own refusal to permit the fulfilment of\r\nthe great design for which that treaty was made. It was under these\r\ncircumstances that the United States, instead of using its forces to\r\ndestroy those who sought to make the engagements of the treaty a\r\nreality, recognized them as the proper custodians of the sovereignty\r\nof the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nThis recognition was, in the second place, further justified by the\r\nhighest considerations of our national interests and safety. In all\r\nthe range of our international relations I do not hesitate to affirm\r\nthat there is nothing of greater or more pressing importance than\r\nthe construction of an interoceanic canal. Long acknowledged to be\r\nessential to our commercial development, it has become, as the result\r\nof the recent extension of our territorial dominion, more than ever\r\nessential to our national self-defence. In transmitting to the Senate\r\nthe treaty of 1846, President Polk pointed out as the principal\r\nreason for its ratification that the passage of the Isthmus, which it\r\nwas designed to secure, “would relieve us from a long and dangerous\r\nnavigation of more than 9,000 miles around Cape Horn, and render our\r\ncommunication with our own possessions on the northwest coast of\r\nAmerica comparatively easy and speedy.” The events of the past five\r\nyears have given to this consideration an importance immeasurably\r\ngreater than it possessed in 1846. In the light of our present\r\nsituation, the establishment of easy and speedy communication by\r\nsea between the Atlantic and the Pacific presents itself not simply\r\nas something to be desired, but as an object to be positively and\r\npromptly attained. Reasons of convenience have been superseded by\r\nreasons of vital necessity, which do not admit of indefinite delays.\r\n\r\nTo such delays the rejection by Colombia of the Hay-Herran treaty\r\ndirectly exposed us. As proof of this fact I need only refer to the\r\nprogramme outlined in the report of the majority of the Panama Canal\r\nCommittee, read in the Colombian Senate on the 14th of October last.\r\nIn this report, which recommended that the discussion of a law to\r\nauthorize the government to enter upon new negotiations should be\r\nindefinitely postponed, it is proposed that the consideration of\r\nthe subject should be deferred till October 31, 1904, when the next\r\nColombian Congress should have met in ordinary session. By that time,\r\nas the report goes on to say, the extension of time granted to the New\r\nPanama Canal Company by treaty in 1893 would have expired, and the\r\nnew Congress would be in a position to take up the question whether\r\nthe company had not, in spite of further extensions that had been\r\ngranted by legislative acts, forfeited all its property and rights.\r\n“When that time arrives,” the report significantly declares, “the\r\nRepublic, without any impediment, will be able to contract, and will\r\nbe in more clear, more definite, and more advantageous possession,\r\nboth legally and materially.” The naked meaning of this report is that\r\nColombia proposed to wait until, by the enforcement of a forfeiture\r\nrepugnant to the ideas of justice which obtain in every civilized\r\nnation, the property and rights of the New Panama Canal Company could\r\nbe confiscated.\r\n\r\nSuch is the scheme to which it was proposed that the United States\r\nshould be invited to become a party. The construction of the canal\r\nwas to be relegated to the indefinite future, while Colombia was,\r\nby reason of her own delay, to be placed in the “more advantageous”\r\nposition of claiming not merely the compensation to be paid by the\r\nUnited States for the privilege of completing the canal, but also\r\nthe forty millions authorized by the act of 1902 to be paid for the\r\nproperty of the New Panama Canal Company. That the attempt to carry\r\nout this scheme would have brought Colombia into conflict with the\r\nGovernment of France can not be doubted; nor could the United States\r\nhave counted upon immunity from the consequences of the attempt,\r\neven apart from the indefinite delays to which the construction of\r\nthe canal was to be subjected. On the first appearance of danger to\r\nColombia, this Government would have been summoned to interpose, in\r\norder to give effect to the guarantees of the treaty of 1846; and all\r\nthis in support of a plan which, while characterized in its first\r\nstage by the wanton disregard of our own highest interests, was fitly\r\nto end in further injury to the citizens of a friendly nation, whose\r\nenormous losses in their generous efforts to pierce the Isthmus have\r\nbecome a matter of history.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, I confidently maintain that the recognition of the\r\nRepublic of Panama was an act justified by the interests of collective\r\ncivilization. If ever a government could be said to have received a\r\nmandate from civilization to effect an object the accomplishment of\r\nwhich was demanded in the interest of mankind, the United States\r\nholds that position with regard to the interoceanic canal. Since\r\nour purpose to build the canal was definitely announced, there have\r\ncome from all quarters assurances of approval and encouragement, in\r\nwhich even Colombia herself at one time participated; and to general\r\nassurances were added specific acts and declarations. In order that\r\nno obstacle might stand in our way, Great Britain renounced important\r\nrights under the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and agreed to its abrogation,\r\nreceiving in return nothing but our honorable pledge to build the\r\ncanal and protect it as an open highway. It was in view of this\r\npledge, and of the proposed enactment by the Congress of the United\r\nStates of legislation to give it immediate effect, that the second\r\nPan-American Conference, at the City of Mexico, on January 22, 1902,\r\nadopted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n  The Republics assembled at the International Conference of Mexico\r\n  applaud the purpose of the United States Government to construct an\r\n  interoceanic canal, and acknowledge that this work will not only\r\n  be worthy of the greatness of the American people, but also in the\r\n  highest sense a work of civilization, and to the greatest degree\r\n  beneficial to the development of commerce between the American\r\n  States and the other countries of the world.\r\n\r\nAmong those who signed this resolution on behalf of their respective\r\ngovernments was General Reyes, the delegate of Colombia. Little\r\ncould it have been foreseen that two years later the Colombian\r\nGovernment, led astray by false allurements of selfish advantage, and\r\nforgetful alike of its international obligations and of the duties\r\nand responsibilities of sovereignty, would thwart the efforts of the\r\nUnited States to enter upon and complete a work which the nations\r\nof America, re-echoing the sentiment of the nations of Europe, had\r\npronounced to be not only “worthy of the greatness of the American\r\npeople,” but also “in the highest sense a work of civilization.”\r\n\r\nThat our position as the mandatary of civilization has been by no\r\nmeans misconceived is shown by the promptitude with which the powers\r\nhave, one after another, followed our lead in recognizing Panama as an\r\nindependent State. Our action in recognizing the new republic has been\r\nfollowed by like recognition on the part of France, Germany, Denmark,\r\nRussia, Sweden, and Norway, Nicaragua, Peru, China, Cuba, Great\r\nBritain, Italy, Costa Rica, Japan, and Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nIn view of the manifold considerations of treaty right and obligation,\r\nof national interest and safety, and of collective civilization,\r\nby which our Government was constrained to act, I am at a loss to\r\ncomprehend the attitude of those who can discern in the recognition\r\nof the Republic of Panama only a general approval of the principle of\r\n“revolution” by which a given government is overturned or one portion\r\nof a country separated from another. Only the amplest justification\r\ncan warrant a revolutionary movement of either kind. But there is\r\nno fixed rule which can be applied to all such movements. Each case\r\nmust be judged on its own merits. There have been many revolutionary\r\nmovements, many movements for the dismemberment of countries, which\r\nwere evil, tried by any standard. But in my opinion no disinterested\r\nand fair-minded observer acquainted with the circumstances can fail\r\nto feel that Panama had the amplest justification for separation\r\nfrom Colombia under the conditions existing, and, moreover, that its\r\naction was in the highest degree beneficial to the interests of the\r\nentire civilized world by securing the immediate opportunity for\r\nthe building of the interoceanic canal. It would be well for those\r\nwho are pessimistic as to our action in peacefully recognizing the\r\nRepublic of Panama, while we lawfully protected the transit from\r\ninvasion and disturbance, to recall what has been done in Cuba, where\r\nwe intervened even by force on general grounds of national interest\r\nand duty. When we interfered it was freely prophesied that we intended\r\nto keep Cuba and administer it for our own interests. The result has\r\ndemonstrated in singularly conclusive fashion the falsity of these\r\nprophecies. Cuba is now an independent republic. We governed it in its\r\nown interests for a few years, till it was able to stand alone, and\r\nthen started it upon its career of self-government and independence,\r\ngranting it all necessary aid. We have received from Cuba a grant of\r\ntwo naval stations, so situated that they in no possible way menace\r\nthe liberty of the island, and yet serve as important defences for\r\nthe Cuban people, as well as for our own people, against possible\r\nforeign attack. The people of Cuba have been immeasurably benefited\r\nby our interference in their behalf, and our own gain has been great.\r\nSo will it be with Panama. The people of the Isthmus, and as I firmly\r\nbelieve of the adjacent parts of Central and South America, will be\r\ngreatly benefited by the building of the canal and the guarantee of\r\npeace and order along its line; and hand in hand with the benefit\r\nto them will go the benefit to us and to mankind. By our prompt and\r\ndecisive action, not only have our interests and those of the world\r\nat large been conserved, but we have forestalled complications which\r\nwere likely to be fruitful in loss to ourselves, and in bloodshed and\r\nsuffering to the people of the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nInstead of using our forces, as we were invited by Colombia to do, for\r\nthe twofold purpose of defeating our own rights and interests and the\r\ninterests of the civilized world, and of compelling the submission of\r\nthe people of the Isthmus to those whom they regarded as oppressors,\r\nwe shall, as in duty bound, keep the transit open and prevent its\r\ninvasion. Meanwhile, the only question now before us is that of the\r\nratification of the treaty. For it is to be remembered that a failure\r\nto ratify the treaty will not undo what has been done, will not\r\nrestore Panama to Colombia, and will not alter our obligation to keep\r\nthe transit open across the Isthmus, and to prevent any outside power\r\nfrom menacing this transit.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been assumed in certain quarters that the proposition\r\nthat the obligations of article 35 of the treaty of 1846 are to\r\nbe considered as adhering to and following the sovereignty of the\r\nIsthmus, so long as that sovereignty is not absorbed by the United\r\nStates, rests upon some novel theory. No assumption could be further\r\nfrom the fact. It is by no means true that a state in declaring its\r\nindependence rids itself of all the treaty obligations entered into\r\nby the parent government. It is a mere coincidence that this question\r\nwas once raised in a case involving the obligations of Colombia as an\r\nindependent state under a treaty which Spain had made with the United\r\nStates many years before Spanish-American independence. In that case\r\nMr. John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State, in an instruction to Mr.\r\nAnderson, our minister to Colombia, of May 27, 1823, said:\r\n\r\n  By a treaty between the United States and Spain concluded at a time\r\n  when Colombia was a part of the Spanish dominions ... the principle\r\n  that free ships make free goods was expressly recognized and\r\n  established. It is asserted that by her declaration of independence\r\n  Colombia has been entirely released from all the obligations by\r\n  which, as a part of the Spanish nation, she was bound to other\r\n  nations. This principle is not tenable. To all the engagements of\r\n  Spain with other nations, affecting their rights and interests,\r\n  Colombia, so far as she was affected by them, remains bound in\r\n  honor and in justice. The stipulation now referred to is of that\r\n  character.\r\n\r\nThe principle thus asserted by Mr. Adams was afterward sustained by\r\nan international commission in respect to the precise stipulation to\r\nwhich he referred; and a similar position was taken by the United\r\nStates with regard to the binding obligation upon the independent\r\nState of Texas of commercial stipulations embodied in prior treaties\r\nbetween the United States and Mexico when Texas formed a part of\r\nthe latter country. But in the present case it is unnecessary to go\r\nso far. Even if it be admitted that prior treaties of a political\r\nand commercial complexion generally do not bind a new state formed\r\nby separation, it is undeniable that stipulations having a local\r\napplication to the territory embraced in the new state continue in\r\nforce and are binding upon the new sovereign. Thus it is on all\r\nhands conceded that treaties relating to boundaries and to rights of\r\nnavigation continue in force without regard to changes in government\r\nor in sovereignty. This principle obviously applies to that part of\r\nthe treaty of 1846 which relates to the Isthmus of Panama.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion let me repeat that the question actually before this\r\nGovernment is not that of the recognition of Panama as an independent\r\nrepublic. That is already an accomplished fact. The question, and the\r\nonly question, is whether or not we shall build an Isthmian Canal.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith copies of the latest notes from the minister of\r\nthe Republic of Panama to this Government, and of certain notes which\r\nhave passed between the special envoy of the Republic of Colombia and\r\nthis Government.\r\n\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n  WHITE HOUSE,\r\n      _January 4, 1904_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM THE MESSAGES OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT AS GOVERNOR OF THE\r\nSTATE OF NEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE OF THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK TO THE LEGISLATURE, JANUARY 2, 1899\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  STATE OF NEW YORK, EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,\r\n                                  ALBANY, _January 2, 1899_\r\n\r\n_To the Legislature_:\r\n\r\nThe people of New York, like the people of every other State in the\r\nUnion, are to be congratulated, because during the past year the\r\nNation has carried to a brilliant triumph one of the most righteous\r\nwars of modern times. When last spring it became evident that the\r\ninterests of humanity and of national honor alike demanded that we\r\nshould drive Spain from the Western Hemisphere and free from her\r\ntyranny the subject peoples of the islands of the sea, New York\r\nresponded with eager zeal to the call for volunteers, and in the\r\nCabinet, in Congress and in camp, her representatives did all they\r\ncould to insure the success of the American policy. We are not merely\r\nNew Yorkers. We are Americans; and the interests of all Americans,\r\nwhether from the North, the South, the East or the great West, are\r\nequally dear to the men of the Empire State. As we grow into a mighty\r\nnation, which, whether it will or not, must inevitably play a great\r\npart for good or for evil in the affairs of the world at large,\r\nthe people of New York wish it understood that they look at all\r\nquestions of American foreign policy from the most thoroughly national\r\nstandpoint. The tropic islands we have taken must neither be allowed\r\nto lapse into anarchy nor to return under the sway of tyranny. War\r\nis a grim thing at best, but the war through which we have passed\r\nhas left us not merely memories of glory won on land and sea, but\r\nan even more blessed heritage, the knowledge that it was waged from\r\nthe highest motives, for the good of others as well as for our own\r\nnational honor. Above all, we are thankful that it brought home to all\r\nof us the fact that the country was indeed one when serious danger\r\nconfronted it. The men from the East and the West, from the North and\r\nthe South, the sons of those who wore the blue and of those who wore\r\nthe gray, the men of means and the men who all their lives long had\r\npossessed only what day by day they toiled to earn, stood shoulder to\r\nshoulder in the fight, met the same dangers, shared the same hardships\r\nand won the same ultimate triumph.\r\n\r\nIn our domestic affairs, the State is to be congratulated on the\r\ngradual return of prosperity. Though temporarily checked by the\r\nwar this return has been on the whole steady. The capitalist finds\r\nconstantly greater business opportunities; the wage-worker, in\r\nconsequence, is more steadily employed; the farmer has a better\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAXATION\r\n\r\nNo other question is of such permanent importance in the domestic\r\neconomy of our State as the question of taxation. At present our\r\nsystem of taxation is in utter confusion, full of injustices and of\r\nqueer anomalies. It is an exceedingly difficult subject, one well\r\nworthy the attention of our best men, the men with most highly trained\r\nminds and the broadest practical experience; men who are able to\r\napproach the subject from the standpoints alike of the farmer, the\r\nmerchant, and the manufacturer. Not only is it necessary to consider\r\nwhether any kind of tax ought, if practicable, to be levied, but\r\nwhether it is in fact practicable to levy it. We should discourage the\r\nbuilding up of non-taxable interests, and yet we should discourage\r\ndriving property out of the State by unwise taxation, or levying a\r\ntax which is in effect largely a tax upon honesty. I most earnestly\r\ncommend the whole matter to your special attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE OF THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK TO THE LEGISLATURE, MAY 22, 1899\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  STATE OF NEW YORK, EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,\r\n                                  ALBANY, _May 22, 1899_\r\n\r\n_To the Legislature_:\r\n\r\nI have called you together in extraordinary session for the purpose of\r\nconsidering the subject of the taxation of franchises.\r\n\r\nMy message to the Legislature of March 27, 1899, ran in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“At present the farmers, the market gardeners, and the mechanics and\r\ntradesmen having small holdings are paying an improper and excessive\r\nportion of the general taxes, while at the same time many of the\r\nefforts to remedy this state of affairs, notably in the direction of\r\ntaxing securities, are not only unwise, but inefficient, and often\r\nserve merely to put a premium upon dishonesty.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“There is evident injustice in the light taxation of corporations. I\r\nhave not the slightest sympathy with the outcry against corporations\r\nas such, or against prosperous men of business. Most of the great\r\nmaterial works by which the entire country benefits have been due to\r\nthe action of individual men, or of aggregates of men, who made money\r\nfor themselves by doing that which was in the interest of the people\r\nas a whole. From an armor plant to a street railway no work which is\r\nreally beneficial to the public can be performed to the best advantage\r\nof the public save by men of such business capacity that they will not\r\ndo the work unless they themselves receive ample reward for doing it.\r\nThe effort to deprive them of an ample reward, merely means that they\r\nwill turn their energies in some other direction; and the public will\r\nbe by just so much the loser. Moreover, to tax corporations or men\r\nof means in such a way as to drive them out of the State works great\r\ndamage to the State. To drive out of a community the men of means\r\nand the men who take the lead in business enterprises would probably\r\nentail, as one of its first results, the starvation of a considerable\r\nportion of the remainder of the population.\r\n\r\n“But while I freely admit all this, it yet remains true that a\r\ncorporation which derives its powers from the State should pay to the\r\nState a just percentage of its earnings as a return for the privileges\r\nit enjoys. This should be especially true for the franchises bestowed\r\nupon gas companies, street railroads and the like. The question of\r\nthe municipal ownership of these franchises can not be raised with\r\npropriety until the governments of all municipalities show greater\r\nwisdom and virtue than has been recently shown, for instance, in\r\nNew York City; and the question of laying and assessing the tax for\r\nfranchises of every kind throughout the State should in my opinion be\r\ndetermined by the State itself. I need not point out to you that in\r\nforeign communities a very large percentage of the taxes comes from\r\ncorporations which use the public domain for pipes, tracks and the\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\nI stated that the power of assessing the tax on franchises should be\r\nleft with the State authorities—not the local authorities—because in\r\nmy view this was desirable both for the sake of providing against\r\nimproper favoritism of or discrimination against corporations by\r\nthe local authorities, for the sake of working equity as between\r\nthe franchises in different localities, and finally for the sake of\r\nproviding for the cases where a railroad or telephone or telegraph\r\nline runs through several different communities.\r\n\r\nMany representatives of corporations owning franchises heartily\r\napprove of having them properly taxed; and I am confident that, in the\r\nend, this will be of positive benefit to the franchise owners, and in\r\nno way oppressive to them, save as all taxes are oppressive to all\r\nowners of property.\r\n\r\nThe line of cleavage between good and bad citizenship does not\r\nfollow the line dividing the men who represent corporate interests\r\nfrom the men who do not; it runs at right angles to it. We are bound\r\nto recognize this fact, to remember that we should stand for good\r\ncitizenship in every form, and should neither yield to demagogic\r\ninfluence on the one hand, nor to improper corporate influence on\r\nthe other. There is no intention of oppressing people who have put\r\ntheir money into franchises. We recognize that, as in the case of\r\nall legitimate business, they benefit not only themselves but the\r\ncommunity at large. If a franchise is worth very little, it should\r\nbe taxed very little; but where the franchise is of great value, it\r\ncertainly should be heavily taxed; and the value is of course based\r\nupon the use of the city’s or State’s real estate. Such use of the\r\npublic real estate should not be given without substantial returns;\r\nreturns not only in the way of service to the public, which of course\r\na street railway or a gas company gives, precisely as the proprietor\r\nof a grocery or dry goods store gives it, but also in the way of\r\nbearing a just share of the burden of taxation; again, precisely\r\nas the owner of the grocery or dry goods store bears his share,\r\nthe difference being that a railroad company, for instance, owes\r\ninfinitely more than the proprietor of a big business establishment\r\ndoes, to the real estate itself. Of course, this value differs greatly\r\nin different places. Where population is dense, as in New York City,\r\nthe real estate along which the tracks are laid on Broadway may be\r\nworth an immense amount for every lineal foot, exactly as the real\r\nestate fronting this portion of Broadway is worth an immense amount\r\nfor every lineal foot. In sparsely settled districts, however, the\r\nvalue of the real estate of the railroad will diminish greatly, just\r\nas the value of the realty through which it runs diminishes.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly well aware that as Chief Justice Marshall says: “The\r\npower of taxation is the power of destruction.” But this applies to\r\nevery species of property. If demagogues or ignorant enthusiasts who\r\nare misled by demagogues could succeed in destroying wealth, they\r\nwould of course simply work the ruin of the entire community; and\r\nfirst of all, of the unfortunates for whom they profess to feel an\r\nespecial interest. But the very existence of unreasoning hostility to\r\nwealth should make us all the more careful in seeing that wealth does\r\nnothing to justify such hostility. We are the true friends of the men\r\nof means, we are the true friends of the lawful corporate interests\r\nwhich do good work for the community, when we insist that the man of\r\nmeans and the great corporation shall pay their full share of taxes\r\nand bear their full share of the public burdens. If this is done,\r\nthen sooner or later will follow public recognition of the fact that\r\nit is done; and when there is no legitimate basis for discontent, the\r\nAmerican public is sure sooner or later to cease to feel discontent.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature passed, and there is now before me, a bill for the\r\ntaxation of franchises by treating them as realty. After watching the\r\nprogress of this bill I became convinced that the opposition to it\r\nwas less to its particular features than to the general principle of\r\ntaxing franchises in any way; in other words, I became convinced that\r\nany really effective measure of taxation aimed at franchises would\r\nbe vigorously opposed. It therefore became of the utmost importance\r\nto secure this year some statutory enactment which would distinctly\r\nrecognize the principle which we seek to establish. Toward the end\r\nof the session it became evident that the influences against the\r\ntaxation of franchises would be content with nothing save the defeat\r\nof any measure of substantial relief; and a measure of less than\r\nsubstantial relief I would not accept. Finally it became evident that\r\nthe Legislature could pass only one bill and that without amendment.\r\nI therefore sent in a special message asking for the passage of this\r\nbill. It was passed on the last day of the session. It represents a\r\nlong stride in the right direction, and one from which there must be\r\nno retrogression.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it can be greatly bettered if amended in two important\r\nparticulars. In its essential principle, that of taxing franchises\r\nas realty, it is right and proper. After much study of the question,\r\nI am convinced that in this way we can come nearer to doing justice\r\nthan in any other which has as yet been proposed. It is no new thing\r\nto treat franchises as realty. They are so treated in Washburn’s\r\nwork on real property, and by Chancellor Kent; but under the laws\r\nof New York as they are now a franchise can not be taxed except by\r\nspecial statute, and as a matter of fact this extremely valuable\r\nspecies of property is in very many, if not in most, cases untaxed\r\nor taxed far below its value in comparison with other kinds of real\r\nestate. Local franchises are granted for various purposes and under\r\nvarying conditions; sometimes by special statute and sometimes by\r\nthe municipal authorities under a general statute. The value of the\r\nfranchise of course varies widely in different localities, depending\r\nupon a variety of circumstances; but a great part of its value is\r\ndependent upon the same causes which operate to make other kinds\r\nof real estate more valuable in one locality than in another. The\r\nfranchise is inseparable from the property of the corporation in the\r\nstreet, whether this property consists of poles, pipes, or tracks,\r\nabove the ground, under the ground, or on the ground. The right to\r\nlay a railroad track and operate a railroad in a public street can\r\nnot be separated or dissociated from the railroad itself. This is\r\nequally true of the right to lay water and gas mains and the like.\r\nThe franchise is a necessary and inevitable element of value and is\r\na proper subject of consideration in determining the taxable value of\r\nthe real property of the corporation enjoying it. The right to occupy\r\na street should not be classed as an intangible something, distinct\r\nfrom the other property of the company, but should be treated as a\r\nnecessary incident to the tangible property and one to be considered\r\nin measuring the value of the whole property. The Nichols law in Ohio\r\nwhich provides for the taxation of certain kinds of corporations such\r\nas telegraph and telephone companies and the like, doing business in\r\nthe public streets, proceeds along these lines, and has in practice\r\nbeen found to work admirably. It is possible that further experience\r\nmay enable us to find some better method of taxing franchises, but\r\nwith our present knowledge it is certainly wisest to tax them as\r\nrealty.\r\n\r\nUnder the bill before me the assessment will be levied by the local\r\nauthorities. This would result in many cases in a dozen different\r\nsets of local authorities assessing the value of different parts\r\nof the same franchise. It is on every account far better that this\r\nassessment should be delegated to the State authorities who will\r\nnecessarily ascertain all the conditions affecting the franchise and\r\nobtain information which will enable them to judge of the value of\r\nthe franchise in the different localities in which it is exercised.\r\nThe Board of State Tax Commissioners can collate the facts, compare\r\nconditions and determine values as a result of a wider range of\r\nobservation and experience than can be obtained by local officers,\r\nand under them the system of assessment will tend to produce justice,\r\nharmony and uniformity. This is the system adopted under the Nichols\r\nlaw and it has worked well in practice.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the bill before me fails to take account of the fact\r\nthat, in a very unequal and irregular way, many corporations do\r\nalready pay a certain, though usually an utterly inadequate sum in\r\ntaxes. Some pay nothing at all to the local municipalities, but others\r\npay sums varying from one to five per cent on their gross earnings.\r\nThe amounts have been determined in the most haphazard manner and bear\r\nno proportion whatever to the value of the franchises or to their\r\nearning capacity. It is obviously unjust, when introducing a system\r\nunder which we believe that these franchises will for the first time\r\nbe fully and fairly taxed according to their respective values, not\r\nto allow for this existing and inequitable taxation. Accordingly it\r\nshould be provided that from the sum assessed by the State authorities\r\nas the tax which a corporation must pay because of its local\r\nfranchise, there shall be deducted the amount already annually paid by\r\nit to the locality for such franchise. In no other way is it possible\r\nto tax these corporations with uniformity and equity. It is contended\r\nby the advocates of the bill that in reaching the value of the\r\nfranchise under the new law the amount thus paid away in taxes must\r\nbe allowed for and deducted anyhow; but it is not certain that this\r\nwould be done, and in any event the principal should be definitely\r\nestablished by the law itself. There can be no possible opposition to\r\nputting it in the law by any man who is anxious to tax corporations\r\nas other property is taxed, and who believes that this end can be\r\nattained by taxing them as realty. Either by taxing them as realty we\r\nshall tax them at their full value, or we shall not; if, as we hold,\r\nthe former is the case, it would be unjust to tax them for more than\r\ntheir full value, and this would happen were not these existing taxes\r\ndeducted.\r\n\r\nIf it is claimed that the particular method of assessment by the\r\nState Tax Commission may be improper or unjust, provision can be made\r\nfor the same appeal to the courts that now lies in the case of any\r\nassessment on other kinds of property.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I recommend the enactment of a law which shall tax all\r\nthese franchises as realty, which shall provide for the assessment\r\nof the tax by the Board of State Tax Commissioners, and which shall\r\nfurther provide that from the tax thus levied for the benefit of each\r\nlocality there shall be deducted the taxes now paid by the corporation\r\nin question. Furthermore, as the time for assessing the largest and\r\nwealthiest corporations, those of New York and Buffalo, has passed for\r\nthis year, and as it will be preferable not to have the small country\r\ncorporations taxed before the larger corporations of the cities are\r\ntaxed, I suggest that the operations of the law be deferred until\r\nOctober first, of this year.\r\n\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE OF THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK TO THE LEGISLATURE, JANUARY 3, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  STATE OF NEW YORK, EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,\r\n                                  ALBANY, _January 3, 1900_\r\n\r\n_To the Legislature_:\r\n\r\nIt is a very genuine pleasure to congratulate the Legislature upon\r\nthe substantial sum of achievement in legislation and administration\r\nof the past year. Laws of the utmost usefulness to the community\r\nhave been enacted, and there has been a steady betterment throughout\r\nthe year in the methods and results of the administration of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe whole problem of taxation is now, as it has been at almost all\r\ntimes and in almost all places, one of extreme difficulty. It has\r\nbecome more and more evident in recent years that existing methods\r\nof taxation, which worked well enough in a simpler state of society,\r\nare not adequate to secure justice when applied to the conditions of\r\nour complex and highly specialized modern industrial development.\r\nAt present the real estate owner is certainly bearing an excessive\r\nproportion of the tax burden. Men who have made a special study of\r\nthe theory of taxation and men who have had long experience in its\r\npractical application are alike in conflict among themselves as to the\r\nbest general system. Absolute equality, absolute justice in matters of\r\ntaxation will probably never be realized; but we can approximate it\r\nmuch more closely than at present. The last Legislature most wisely\r\nappointed a committee to consider the feasibility of a thorough and\r\nfar-reaching change in our tax laws; and there is good reason to\r\nbelieve that their forthcoming report will present a scheme which will\r\nreceive the support of substantially all classes of taxpayers, and\r\nwhich will be of such a character as to commend itself to the most\r\ncareful consideration of your body upon broad lines.\r\n\r\nThe law must not only be correct in the abstract; it must work well\r\nin the concrete. Experience shows that certain classes or symbols of\r\nproperty which in theory ought to be taxed can not under the present\r\npractice be reached. Some kinds of taxes are so fertile in tempting\r\nto perjury and sharp dealing that they amount to taxes on honesty—the\r\nlast quality on which we should impose a needless burden. Moreover,\r\nwhere the conditions and complexity of life vary widely as between\r\ndifferent communities, the desirability and possibility of certain\r\ntaxes may seem or be so different that it is hard to devise a common\r\nsystem that will work. If possible the State tax should be levied on\r\nclasses of property, and in a manner which will render it collectible\r\nwith entire fairness in all sections of the community, as for instance\r\nthe corporation or collateral inheritance tax is now collected. So far\r\nas possible we should divorce the State and municipal taxes, so as\r\nto render unnecessary the annual equalization of values between the\r\nseveral counties which has proved so fertile a source of friction\r\nbetween the city and the country.\r\n\r\nThere is a constant influx into New York State of capital ofttimes\r\npreviously incorporated under the laws of other States, and an\r\nincreasing number of men of means from other parts of the country,\r\nnon-residents of New York, come into this State to sojourn and to\r\nconduct and be at the head of various business enterprises which are\r\ndrawn to New York as the financial centre of the whole country. This\r\ncalls for legislation which shall provide, in a broad and fair spirit,\r\nfor taxing foreign capital in this State, whether in corporate or\r\nindividual form, exactly as we tax domestic capital doing business\r\nalong the same lines.\r\n\r\nI call your attention to the fact that the great burden of taxation\r\nis local, not State. In the large cities the heavy local charges are\r\nmainly due to the action of the local authorities themselves. For\r\nthis the local authorities are of course responsible. But sometimes\r\ntaxation is added to by legislative enactment.\r\n\r\nOn certain points the failure of the tax laws has become so evident\r\nthat it is possible to provide more or less complete remedies without\r\nwaiting for a general scheme of reorganization. Again and again\r\nin recent years this has been recognized, and through legislative\r\nenactment certain species of property which had escaped taxation\r\nhave been made to pay their proper share of the public burdens. The\r\ncollateral inheritance tax offers a case in point. The corporation\r\ntax offers another. In all these matters of taxation, however, it is\r\nnecessary to proceed with extreme caution, the path never being so\r\nsimple and clear as the advocates of any particular measure invariably\r\nbelieve. Every wealthy corporation that perpetrates or is allowed to\r\nperpetrate a wrong helps to produce or inflame a condition of angry\r\nexcitement against all corporations, which in its turn may in the end\r\nharm alike the honest and the dishonest agents of public service and\r\nthereby do far-reaching damage to the whole body politic. Much of the\r\noutcry against wealth, against the men who acquire wealth, and against\r\nthe means by which it is acquired, is blind, unreasoning and unjust;\r\nbut in too many cases it has a basis in real abuses; and we must\r\nremember that every act of misconduct which affords any justification\r\nfor this clamor is not only bad because of the wrong done but also\r\nbecause the justification thus given inevitably strengthens movements\r\nwhich are in reality profoundly anti-social and anti-civic. Our laws\r\nshould be so drawn as to protect and encourage corporations which do\r\ntheir honest duty by the public; and to discriminate sharply against\r\nthose organized in a spirit of mere greed, or for improper speculative\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of misconduct, plenty of selfish disregard of the\r\nrights of others, and especially of the weak. There is also plenty of\r\nhonorable and disinterested effort to prevent such misconduct or to\r\nminimize its effects. Any rational attempt to prevent or counteract\r\nthe evils, by legislation or otherwise, is deserving of hearty\r\nsupport; but it can not be too deeply impressed upon us that such\r\nattempts can result in permanent good only in proportion as they are\r\nmade in a sane and wholesome spirit, as far removed as possible from\r\nwhatever is hysterical or revolutionary. It is infinitely better when\r\nneeded social and civic changes can be brought about as the result\r\nof natural and healthy growth than when they come with the violent\r\ndislocation and widespread wreck and damage inevitably attendant upon\r\nany movement which is revolutionary in its nature.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a change should never be shirked on the ground of\r\nits being radical, when the abuse has become flagrant and no other\r\nremedy appears possible. This was the case with the taxation of local\r\nfranchises in this State. For years most of these franchises escaped\r\npaying their proper share of the public burdens. The last Legislature\r\nplaced on the statute book a law requiring them to be treated as\r\nreal estate for the purposes of taxation, the tax to be assessed and\r\ncollected by the State Assessors for the benefit of the localities\r\nconcerned. This marks an immense stride in advance. Of course at first\r\nserious difficulties are sure to arise in enforcing it. The means for\r\ncarrying it into effect are very inadequate. There may be delay before\r\nwe get from it the substantial additions to the revenue which will\r\nfinally accrue, and there may be disappointment to the enthusiasts\r\nwho are so apt to hope too much from such legislation. But it will\r\nundoubtedly add largely to the public revenues as soon as it is fairly\r\nin operation, and the amount thus added will increase steadily year\r\nby year. The principle which this law establishes has come to stay.\r\nThere will doubtless have to be additional legislation from time\r\nto time to perfect the system as its shortcomings are made evident\r\nin actual practice. But the corporations owning valuable public\r\nfranchises must pay their full and proper share of the public burdens.\r\n\r\nThe franchise tax law is framed with the intent of securing exact and\r\nequal justice, no more and no less. It is not in any way intended as a\r\nmeans for persecuting or oppressing corporations. It is not intended\r\nto cut down legitimate dividends; still less to cut down wages or\r\nto prevent a just return for the far-sighted business skill of some\r\ncaptain of industry who has been able to establish a public service\r\ngreatly to the advantage of the localities concerned, where before his\r\ntime men of less business capacity had failed. But it is intended that\r\nproperty which derives its value from the grant of a privilege by the\r\npublic, shall be taxed proportionately to the value of the privilege\r\ngranted. In enforcing this law, much tact, patience, resolution and\r\njudgment will be needed. All these qualities the State Board of Tax\r\nCommissioners have thus far shown. Their salaries are altogether\r\ninadequate, for the new law has immensely increased not only their\r\nresponsibilities, but their work. They should be given not only the\r\nneeded increase for themselves, but also an appropriation for an\r\nadditional number of clerks and experts.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1899 not a single corporation has received at the\r\nhands of the State of New York one privilege of any kind, sort or\r\ndescription, by law or otherwise, to which it was not entitled, and\r\nwhich was not in the public interest; nor has corporate influence\r\navailed against any measure which was in the public interest. At\r\ncertain times, and in certain places, corporations have undoubtedly\r\nexerted a corrupting influence in political life; but in this State\r\nfor this year it is absolutely true, as shown by the history of every\r\nmeasure that has come before the Legislature from the franchise tax\r\ndown, that no corporate influence has been able to prevail against the\r\ninterests of the public.\r\n\r\nIt has become more and more evident of late years that the State\r\nwill have to act in its collective capacity as regards certain\r\nsubjects which we have been accustomed to treat as matters affecting\r\nthe private citizen only, and that furthermore, it must exercise an\r\nincreasing and more rigorous control over other matters which it is\r\nnot desirable that it should directly manage. It is neither possible\r\nnor desirable to lay down a general hard and fast rule as to what\r\nthis control should be in all cases. There is no possible reason in\r\npure logic why a city, for instance, should supply its inhabitants\r\nwith water, and allow private companies to supply them with gas, any\r\nmore than there is why the general government should take charge of\r\nthe delivery of letters but not of telegrams. On the other hand, pure\r\nlogic has a very restricted application to actual social and civic\r\nlife, and there is no possible reason for changing from one system\r\nto the other simply because the change would make our political\r\nsystem in theory more symmetrical. Obviously it is undesirable that\r\nthe government should do anything that private individuals could\r\ndo with better results to the community. Everything that tends to\r\ndeaden individual initiative is to be avoided, and unless in a given\r\ncase there is some very evident gain which will flow from State or\r\nmunicipal ownership, it should not be adopted. On the other hand,\r\nwhen private ownership entails grave abuses, and where the work is\r\nof a kind that can be performed with efficiency by the State or\r\nmunicipality acting in its collective capacity, no theory or tradition\r\nshould interfere with our making the change. There is grave danger\r\nin attempting to establish invariable rules; indeed it may be that\r\neach case will have to be determined upon its own merits. In one\r\ninstance a private corporation may be able to do the work best. In\r\nanother the State or city may do it best. In yet a third, it may be\r\nto the advantage of everybody to give free scope to the power of some\r\nindividual captain of industry.\r\n\r\nOn one point there must be no step backward. There is a consensus of\r\nopinion that New York must own its own water supply. Any legislation\r\npermitting private ownership should be annulled.\r\n\r\nNothing needs closer attention, nothing deserves to be treated with\r\nmore courage, caution and sanity, than the relations of the State to\r\ncorporate wealth, and indeed to vast individual wealth. For almost\r\nevery gain there is a penalty, and the great strides in the industrial\r\nupbuilding of the country, which have on the whole been attended\r\nwith marked benefit, have also been attended by no little evil.\r\nGreat fortunes are usually made under very complex conditions both\r\nof effort and of surrounding, and the mere fact of the complexity\r\nmakes it difficult to deal with the new conditions thus created. The\r\ncontrast offered in a highly specialized industrial community between\r\nthe very rich and the very poor is exceedingly distressing, and while\r\nunder normal conditions the acquirement of wealth by an individual is\r\nnecessarily of great incidental benefit to the community as a whole,\r\nyet this is by no means always the case. In our great cities there is\r\nplainly in evidence much wealth contrasted with much poverty, and some\r\nof the wealth has been acquired, or is used, in a manner for which\r\nthere is no moral justification.\r\n\r\nA profound political and social thinker has recently written: “Wealth\r\nwhich is expended in multiplying and elaborating real comforts, or\r\neven in pleasures which produce enjoyment at all proportionate to\r\ntheir cost, will never excite serious indignation. It is the colossal\r\nwaste of the means of human happiness in the most selfish and most\r\nvulgar forms of social advertisement and competition that gives a\r\nforce to passions which menace the whole future of our civilization.”\r\nBut in continuance this writer points out that the only effectual\r\ncheck lies in the law of public opinion. Any attempt to interfere by\r\nstatute in moral questions of this kind, by fettering the freedom of\r\nindividual action, would be injurious to a degree far greater than\r\nis the evil aimed at. Probably the large majority of the fortunes\r\nthat now exist in this country have been amassed, not by injuring\r\nmankind, but as an incident to the conferring of great benefits on the\r\ncommunity—whatever the conscious purpose of those amassing them may\r\nhave been. The occasional wrongs committed or injuries endured are\r\non the whole far outweighed by the mass of good which has resulted.\r\nThe true questions to be asked are: Has any given individual been\r\ninjured by the acquisition of wealth by any man? Were the rights of\r\nthat individual, if they have been violated, insufficiently protected\r\nby law? If so, these rights, and all similar rights, ought to be\r\nguaranteed by additional legislation. The point to be aimed at is the\r\nprotection of the individual against wrong, not the attempt to limit\r\nand hamper the acquisition and output of wealth.\r\n\r\nIt is almost equally dangerous either to blink evils and refuse to\r\nacknowledge their existence or to strike at them in a spirit of\r\nignorant revenge, thereby doing far more harm than is remedied. The\r\nneed can be met only by careful study of conditions, and by action\r\nwhich, while taken boldly and without hesitation, is neither heedless\r\nnor reckless. It is well to remember on the one hand that the adoption\r\nof what is reasonable in the demands of reformers is the surest way to\r\nprevent the adoption of what is unreasonable; and on the other hand\r\nthat many of the worst and most dangerous laws which have been put\r\nupon the statute books have been put there by zealous reformers with\r\nexcellent intentions.\r\n\r\nThis problem has a hundred phases. The relation of the capitalist and\r\nthe wage-worker makes one; the proper attitude of the State toward\r\nextreme poverty another; the proper attitude of the State toward\r\nthe questions of the ownership and running of so-called “public\r\nutilities,” a third. But among all these phases, the one which at this\r\ntime has the greatest prominence is the question of what are commonly\r\ntermed “trusts,” meaning by the name those vast combinations of\r\ncapital, usually flourishing by virtue of some monopolistic element,\r\nwhich have become so startlingly common a feature in the industrial\r\nrevolution which has progressed so rapidly during recent years.\r\n\r\nEvery new feature of this industrial revolution produces hardship\r\nbecause in its later stages it has been literally a revolution\r\ninstead of an evolution. The new inventions and discoveries and the\r\nnew methods of taking advantage of the business facilities afforded\r\nby the extraordinary development of our material civilization have\r\ncaused the changes to proceed with such marvelous rapidity, that at\r\neach stage some body of workers finds itself unable to accommodate\r\nitself to the new conditions with sufficient speed to escape\r\nhardship. In the end the accommodation of the class takes place; at\r\ntimes too late for the well-being of many individuals. The change\r\nwhich would be unaccompanied by hardship if it came slowly, may\r\nbe fraught with severe suffering if it comes too fast, even when\r\nit is in the end beneficial. Occasionally, moreover, the change\r\nis positively deleterious, and very often, even when it is on the\r\nwhole beneficial, it has features which are the reverse. In some\r\ncases, while recognizing the evil, it is impossible with our present\r\nknowledge to discover any remedy. In others, a remedy can be applied,\r\nbut as yet only at a cost that would make it worse than the trouble\r\nitself. In yet others it is possible, by acting with wisdom, coolness\r\nand fearlessness, to apply a remedy which will wholly or in great\r\npart remove the evil while leaving the good behind. We do not wish to\r\ndiscourage enterprise. We do not desire to destroy corporations; we do\r\ndesire to put them fully at the service of the State and the people.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of modern business is so vast and complicated that great\r\ncaution must be exercised in introducing radical changes for fear\r\nthe unforeseen effects may take the shape of widespread disaster.\r\nMoreover, much that is complained about is not really the abuse so\r\nmuch as the inevitable development of our modern industrial life.\r\nWe have moved far away from the old simple days when each community\r\ntransacted almost all its work for itself and relied upon outsiders\r\nfor but a fraction of the necessaries, and for not a very large\r\nportion even of the luxuries, of life. Very many of the anti-trust\r\nlaws which have made their appearance on the statute books of recent\r\nyears have been almost or absolutely ineffective because they have\r\nblinked the all-important fact that much of what they thought to do\r\naway with was incidental to modern industrial conditions, and could\r\nnot be eliminated unless we were willing to turn back the wheels of\r\nmodern progress by also eliminating the forces which had brought\r\nabout these industrial conditions. Not only trusts, but the immense\r\nimportance of machinery, the congestion of city life, the capacity\r\nto make large fortunes by speculative enterprises, and many other\r\nfeatures of modern existence could be thoroughly changed by doing away\r\nwith steam and electricity; but the most ardent denouncer of trusts\r\nwould hesitate to advocate so drastic a remedy. What remains for us\r\nto do, as practical men, is to look the conditions squarely in the\r\nface and not to permit the emotional side of the question, which has\r\nits proper place, to blind us to the fact that there are other sides.\r\nWe must set about finding out what the real abuses are, with their\r\ncauses, and to what extent remedies can be applied.\r\n\r\nThat abuses exist, and that they are of a very grave character, it\r\nis worse than idle to deny. Just so long as in the business world\r\nunscrupulous cunning is allowed the free rein which, thanks to\r\nthe growth of humanity during the past centuries, we now deny to\r\nunscrupulous physical force, then just so long there will be a field\r\nfor the best effort of every honest social and civic reformer who\r\nis capable of feeling an impulse of generous indignation and who is\r\nfar-sighted enough to appreciate where the real danger to the country\r\nlies. The effects are bad enough when the unscrupulous individual\r\nworks by himself. They are much worse when he works in conjunction\r\nwith his fellows through a giant corporation or trust. Law is largely\r\ncrystallized custom, largely a mass of remedies which have been slowly\r\nevolved to meet the wrongs with which humanity has become thoroughly\r\nfamiliar. In a simple society only simple forms of wrong can be\r\ncommitted. There is neither the ability nor the opportunity to inflict\r\nothers. A primitive people provides for the punishment of theft,\r\nassault and murder, because the conditions of the existing society\r\nallow the development of thieves and murderers and the commission\r\nof deeds of violence; but it does not provide for the punishment of\r\nforgery because there is nothing to forge, and therefore, no forgers.\r\nThe gradual growth of humanitarian sentiment, often unconscious or but\r\nsemi-conscious, combined with other causes, step by step emancipated\r\nthe serf from bodily subjection to his over-lord; he was then\r\nprotected in his freedom by statute; but when he became a factory hand\r\nthe conditions were new and there were no laws which prevented the\r\nuse of unguarded machinery in the factories, or the abuses of child\r\nlabor, forced upon the conscientious employers by the unscrupulous\r\nuntil legislation put them on an equality. When new evils appear there\r\nis always at first difficulty in finding the proper remedy; and as the\r\nevils grow more complex, the remedies become increasingly difficult\r\nof application. There is no use whatever in seeking to apply a remedy\r\nblindly; yet this is just what has been done in reference to trusts.\r\n\r\nMuch of the legislation not only proposed but enacted against trusts\r\nis not one whit more intelligent than the mediæval bull against the\r\ncomet, and has not been one particle more effective. Yet there can and\r\nmust be courageous and effective remedial legislation.\r\n\r\nTo say that the present system of haphazard license and lack of\r\nsupervision and regulation, is the best possible, is absurd. The\r\nmen who endeavor to prevent the remedying of real abuses, not only\r\nshow callous disregard for the suffering of others, but also weaken\r\nthose who are anxious to prevent the adoption of indiscriminate\r\nwould-be remedies which would subvert our whole industrial fabric.\r\nThe chicanery and the dishonest, even though not technically illegal,\r\nmethods through which some great fortunes have been made, are scandals\r\nto our civilization. The man who by swindling or wrongdoing acquires\r\ngreat wealth for himself at the expense of his fellow, stands as low\r\nmorally as any predatory mediæval nobleman and is a more dangerous\r\nmember of society. Any law, and any method of construing the law which\r\nwill enable the community to punish him, either by taking away his\r\nwealth or by imprisonment, should be welcomed. Of course, such laws\r\nare even more needed in dealing with great corporations or trusts\r\nthan with individuals. They are needed quite as much for the sake of\r\nhonest corporations as for the sake of the public. The corporation\r\nthat manages its affairs honestly has a right to demand protection\r\nagainst the dishonest corporation. We do not wish to put any burden on\r\nhonest corporations. Neither do we wish to put an unnecessary burden\r\nof responsibility on enterprising men for acts which are immaterial;\r\nthey should be relieved from such burdens, but held to a rigid\r\nfinancial accountability for acts that mislead the upright investor or\r\nstockholder, or defraud the public.\r\n\r\nThe first essential is knowledge of the facts, publicity. Much can be\r\ndone at once by amendment of the corporation laws so as to provide for\r\nsuch publicity as will not work injustice as between business rivals.\r\n\r\nThe chief abuses alleged to arise from trusts are probably the\r\nfollowing: Misrepresentation or concealment regarding material facts\r\nconnected with the organization of an enterprise; the evils connected\r\nwith unscrupulous promotion; overcapitalization; unfair competition,\r\nresulting in the crushing out of competitors who themselves do not\r\nact improperly; raising of prices above fair competitive rates; the\r\nwielding of increased power over the wage-earners. Of course none of\r\nthese abuses may exist in a particular trust, but in many trusts, as\r\nwell as in many corporations not ordinarily called trusts, one or more\r\nof them are evident. Some of these evils could be partially remedied\r\nby a modification of our corporation laws; here we can safely go along\r\nthe lines of the more conservative New England States, and probably\r\nnot a little farther. Such laws will themselves provide the needed\r\npublicity, and the needed circumstantiality of statement. We should\r\nknow authoritatively whether stock represents actual value of plants,\r\nor whether it represents brands or good will; or if not, what it does\r\nrepresent, if anything. It is desirable to know how much was actually\r\nbought, how much was issued free; and to whom; and, if possible,\r\nfor what reason. In the first place, this would be invaluable in\r\npreventing harm being done as among the stockholders, for many of\r\nthe grossest wrongs that are perpetrated are those of promoters and\r\norganizers at the expense of the general public who are invited to\r\ntake shares in business organizations. In the next place, this would\r\nenable us to see just what the public have a right to expect in the\r\nway of service and taxation. There is no reason whatever for refusing\r\nto tax a corporation because by its own acts it has created a burden\r\nof charges under which it staggers. The extravagant man who builds a\r\nneedlessly large house nevertheless pays taxes on the house; and the\r\ncorporation which has to pay great sums of interest owing to juggling\r\ntransactions in the issue of stocks and bonds has just as little right\r\nto consideration. But very great hardship may result to innocent\r\npurchasers; and publicity by lessening the possibility of this would\r\nalso serve the purpose of the State.\r\n\r\nWhere a trust becomes a monopoly the State has an immediate right to\r\ninterfere. Care should be taken not to stifle enterprise or disclose\r\nany facts of a business that are essentially private; but the State\r\nfor the protection of the public should exercise the right to inspect,\r\nto examine thoroughly all the workings of great corporations just\r\nas is now done with banks; and wherever the interests of the public\r\ndemand it, it should publish the results of its examination. Then, if\r\nthere are inordinate profits, competition or public sentiment will\r\ngive the public the benefit in lowered prices; and if not, the power\r\nof taxation remains. It is therefore evident that publicity is the one\r\nsure and adequate remedy which we can now invoke.
