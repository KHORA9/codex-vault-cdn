In the historical chapters, however, and in those which deal\r\nwith recent politics, no changes have been made save such as were needed\r\nfor the correction of one or two slight errors of fact, and for the\r\nmention of new facts, later in date than the first edition. I have left\r\nthe statements of my own views exactly as they were first written, even\r\nwhere I thought that the form of a statement might be verbally improved,\r\nnot only because I still adhere to those views, but also because I\r\ndesire it to be clearly understood that they were formed and expressed\r\nbefore the events of the last few months, and without any reference to\r\nthe controversies of the moment.\r\n\r\nWhen the first edition of the book was published (at the end of 1897)\r\nthere was strong reason to believe as well as to hope that a race\r\nconflict in South Africa would be avoided, and that the political\r\nproblems it presents, acute as they had become early in 1896, would be\r\nsolved in a peaceable way. To this belief and hope I gave expression in\r\nthe concluding chapter of the book, indicating \"tact, coolness and\r\npatience, above all, patience,\" as the qualities needed to attain that\r\nresult which all friends of the country must unite in desiring.\r\n\r\nNow, however, (October 1899), Britain and her South African Colonies and\r\nterritories find themselves at war with the South African Republic and\r\nthe Orange Free State. A new chapter is opened in the history of the\r\ncountry which completely alters the situation, and must necessarily\r\nleave things very different from what it found them. Readers of this new\r\nedition may reasonably expect to find in it some account of the events\r\nwhich have within the last two years led up to this catastrophe, or at\r\nany rate some estimate of that conduct of affairs by the three\r\ngovernments concerned which has brought about a result all three ought\r\nto have sought to avert.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, conclusive reasons against attempting to continue\r\ndown to the outbreak of the war (October 11th) the historical sketch\r\ngiven in Chapters II to XII. The materials for the historian are still\r\nscanty and imperfect, leaving him with data scarcely sufficient for\r\njudging the intention and motives with which some things were done.\r\nRound the acts and words of the representatives of the three governments\r\nconcerned, there rages such a storm of controversy, that whoever places\r\na particular construction upon those acts and words must need support\r\nhis construction by citations from documents and arguments based on\r\nthose citations. To do this would need a space much larger than I can\r\ncommand. The most serious difficulty, however, is that when events are\r\nclose to us and excite strong feelings, men distrust the impartiality of\r\na historian even when he does his best to be impartial. I shall not,\r\ntherefore, attempt to write a history of the last two fateful years, but\r\ncontent myself first, with calling the reader's attention to a few\r\nsalient facts that have occurred since 1896, and to some aspects of the\r\ncase which have been little considered in England; and secondly, with\r\ndescribing as clearly and estimating as cautiously as I can, the forces\r\nthat have worked during those years with such swift and deadly effect.\r\n\r\nSome of these facts may be dismissed with a word or two, because they\r\nlie outside the present crisis. One is the entrance of the Colony of\r\nNatal into the South African Customs Union, an event which created one\r\nuniform tariff system for the whole of British and Dutch South Africa\r\nexcept the Transvaal. Another is the extension of the two great lines of\r\nrailway from the coast into the interior. This extension has given\r\nBulawayo and Matabililand a swift and easy communication with Cape Town,\r\nthereby strengthening immensely the hold of Britain upon the interior,\r\nand lessening any risk that might be feared of future native risings. It\r\nhas also opened up a new and quick route from the coast of the Indian\r\nOcean at Beira into the heart of Mashonaland, and brought the\r\nconstruction of a railway from Mashonaland across the Zambesi to Lake\r\nTanganyika within the horizon of practicable enterprises. A scheme of\r\ngovernment has been settled for the territories of the British South\r\nAfrica Company south of the Zambesi (Southern Rhodesia), which is now\r\nat work. The prospects of gold mining in that region are believed to\r\nhave improved, and the increase of gold production in the mines of the\r\nWitwatersrand has proved even more rapid than was expected in 1896. An\r\nagreement has been concluded between Britain and the German Empire\r\nrelating to their interests on the coast of the Indian Ocean, which,\r\nthough its terms have not been disclosed, is generally understood to\r\nhave removed an obstacle which might have been feared to the acquisition\r\nby Britain of such rights at Delagoa Bay as she may be able to obtain\r\nfrom Portugal, and to have withdrawn from the South African Republic any\r\nhope that State might have cherished of support from Germany in the\r\nevent of a breach with Britain.\r\n\r\nThese events, however, great as is their bearing on the future, are of\r\nless present moment than those which have sprung from Dr. Jameson's\r\nexpedition into the Transvaal in December, 1895, and the internal\r\ntroubles in that State which caused and accompanied his enterprise. It\r\nrekindled race feeling all over South Africa, and has had the most\r\ndisastrous effects upon every part of the country. To understand these\r\neffects it is necessary to understand the state of opinion in the\r\nBritish Colonies and in the two Republics before it took place. Let us\r\nexamine these communities separately.\r\n\r\nIn Cape Colony and Natal there was before December, 1895, no hostility\r\nat all between the British and the Dutch elements. Political parties in\r\nCape Colony were, in a broad sense, British and Dutch, but the\r\ndistinction was really based not so much on racial differences as on\r\neconomic interests. The rural element which desired a protective tariff\r\nand laws regulating native labour, was mainly Dutch, the commercial\r\nelement almost wholly British. Mr. Rhodes, the embodiment of British\r\nImperialism, was Prime Minister through the support of the Dutch element\r\nand the Africander Bond. Englishmen and Dutchmen were everywhere in the\r\nbest social relations. The old blood sympathy of the Dutch element for\r\nthe Transvaal Boers which had been so strongly manifested in 1881, when\r\nthe latter were struggling for their independence, had been superseded,\r\nor at least thrown into the background, by displeasure at the\r\nunneighbourly policy of the Transvaal Government in refusing public\r\nemployment to Cape Dutchmen as well as to Englishmen, and in throwing\r\nobstacles in the way of trade in agricultural products. This displeasure\r\nculminated when the Transvaal Government, in the summer of 1895, closed\r\nthe Drifts (fords) on the Vaal River, to the detriment of imports from\r\nthe Colony and the Orange Free State.\r\n\r\nIn the Orange Free State there was, as has been pointed out in Chapter\r\nXIX., perfect good feeling and cordial co-operation in all public\r\nmatters between the Dutch and the English elements. There was also\r\nperfect friendliness to Britain, the old grievances of the Diamond\r\nFields dispute (see page 144) and of the arrest of the Free State\r\nconquest of Basutoland having been virtually forgotten. Towards the\r\nTransvaal there was a political sympathy based partly on kinship, partly\r\non a similarity of republican institutions. But there was also some\r\nannoyance at the policy which the Transvaal Government, and especially\r\nits Hollander advisers, were pursuing; coupled with a desire to see\r\nreforms effected in the Transvaal, and the franchise granted to\r\nimmigrants on more liberal terms.\r\n\r\nOf the Transvaal itself I need say the less, because its condition is\r\nfully described in Chapter XXV. There was of course much irritation\r\namong the Uitlanders of English and Colonial stock, with an arrogant\r\nrefusal on the part of the ruling section and the more extreme\r\nold-fashioned Boers to admit the claims of these new-comers. But there\r\nwas also a party among the burghers, important more by the character and\r\nability of its members than by its numbers, yet growing in influence,\r\nwhich desired reform, perceived that the existing state of things could\r\nnot continue, and was ready to join the Uitlanders in agitating for\r\nsweeping changes in the Constitution and in administration.\r\n\r\nThe events of December, 1895, changed the face of things swiftly and\r\ndecisively in all these communities.\r\n\r\nIn Cape Colony Dutch feeling, which as a political force was almost\r\nexpiring, revived at once. The unexpected attack on the Transvaal\r\nevolved an outburst of sympathy for it, in which the faults of its\r\ngovernment were forgotten. Mr. Rhodes retired from office. The\r\nreconstructed Ministry which succeeded fell in 1898, and a new Ministry\r\nsupported by the Africander Bond came into power after a general\r\nelection. Its majority was narrow, and was accused of not fairly\r\nrepresenting the country, owing to the nature of the electoral areas. A\r\nRedistribution Bill was passed by a species of compromise, and in the\r\nelections to the new constituencies which followed the Dutch party\r\nslightly increased its majority, and kept its Cabinet (in which,\r\nhowever, men of Dutch blood are a minority) in power. Party feeling,\r\nboth inside and outside the legislature, became, and has remained,\r\nextremely strong on both sides. The English generally have rallied to\r\nand acclaim Mr. Rhodes, whose connection with Dr. Jameson's expedition\r\nhas made him the special object of Dutch hostility. There is, according\r\nto the reports which reach England, no longer any moderating third\r\nparty: all are violent partisans. Nevertheless--and this is a remarkable\r\nand most encouraging fact--this violence did not diminish the warmth\r\nwith which the whole Assembly testified its loyalty and affection\r\ntowards the Queen on the occasion of the completion of the sixtieth year\r\nof her reign in 1897. And the Bond Ministry of Mr. Schreiner proposed\r\nand carried by a unanimous vote a grant of £30,000 per annum as a\r\ncontribution by the Colony to the naval defence of the Empire, leaving\r\nthe application of this sum to the unfettered discretion of the British\r\nAdmiralty.\r\n\r\nIn the Orange Free State the explosion of Dutch sentiment was still\r\nstronger. Its first result was seen in the election of a President. In\r\nNovember, 1895, two candidates for the vacant office had come forward,\r\nand their chances were deemed to be nearly equal. When the news of the\r\nJameson expedition was received, the chance of the candidate of British\r\nstock vanished. Since then, though there was not (so far as I gather)\r\ndown till the last few weeks any indication of hostility to Britain,\r\nmuch less any social friction within the State, a disposition to draw\r\ncloser to the threatened sister Republic showed itself at once. This\r\nled to the conclusion of a defensive alliance between the Free State and\r\nthe Transvaal, whereby either bound itself to defend the other, if\r\nunjustly attacked. (The Transvaal is believed to have suggested, and the\r\nFree State to have refused, a still closer union.) As the Orange Free\r\nState had no reason to fear an attack, just or unjust, from any quarter,\r\nthis was a voluntary undertaking on its part, with no corresponding\r\nadvantage, of what might prove a dangerous liability, and it furnishes a\r\nsignal proof of the love of independence which animates this little\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the Transvaal itself. In that State the burgher party of\r\nconstitutional reform was at once silenced, and its prospect of\r\nusefulness blighted. So, too, the Uitlander agitation was extinguished.\r\nThe Reform leaders were in prison or in exile. The passionate\r\nanti-English feeling, and the dogged refusal to consider reforms, which\r\nhad characterized the extreme party among the Boers, were intensified.\r\nThe influence of President Kruger, more than once threatened in the\r\nyears immediately preceding, was immensely strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe President and his advisers had a golden opportunity before them of\r\nusing the credit and power which the failure of the Rising and the\r\nExpedition of 1895 had given them. They ought to have seen that\r\nmagnanimity would also be wisdom. They ought to have set about a reform\r\nof the administration and to have proposed a moderate enlargement of the\r\nfranchise such as would have admitted enough of the new settlers to give\r\nthem a voice, yet not enough to involve any sudden transfer of\r\nlegislative or executive power. Whether the sentiment of the Boers\r\ngenerally would have enabled the President to extend the franchise may\r\nbe doubtful; but he could at any rate have tried to deal with the more\r\nflagrant abuses of administration. However, he attempted neither. The\r\nabuses remained, and though a Commission reported on some of them, and\r\nsuggested important reforms, no action was taken. The weak point of the\r\nConstitution (as to which see p. 152) was the power which the\r\nlegislature apparently possessed of interfering with vested rights, and\r\neven with pending suits, by a resolution having the force of law. This\r\nwas a defect due, not to any desire to do wrong, but to the inexperience\r\nof those who had originally framed the Constitution, and to the want of\r\nlegal knowledge and skill among those who had worked it, and was\r\naggravated by the fact that the legislature consisted of one Chamber\r\nonly, which was naturally led to legislate by way of resolution\r\n(besluit) because the process of passing laws in the stricter sense of\r\nthe term involved a tedious and cumbrous process of bringing them to the\r\nknowledge of the people throughout the country. Upon this point there\r\narose a dispute with the Chief Justice which led to the dismissal of\r\nthat official and one of his colleagues, a dispute which could not be\r\nexplained here without entering upon technical details. There is no\r\nreason to think that the President's action was prompted by any wish to\r\ngive the legislature the means of wronging individuals, nor has evidence\r\nbeen produced to show that its powers have been in fact (at least to any\r\nmaterial extent) so used. The matter cannot be fairly judged without\r\nconsidering the peculiar character of the Transvaal Constitution, for\r\nwhich the President is nowise to blame, and the statements often made in\r\nthis country that the subjection of the judiciary to the legislature\r\ndestroys the security of property are much exaggerated, for property has\r\nbeen, in fact, secure. It was, nevertheless, an error not to try to\r\nretain a man so much respected as the Chief Justice, and not to fulfil\r\nthe promise given to Sir Henry de Villiers (who had been invoked as\r\nmediator) that the judiciary should be placed in a more assured\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe idea which seems to have filled the President's mind was that force\r\nwas the only remedy. The Republic was, he thought, sure to be again\r\nattacked from within or from without; and the essential thing was to\r\nstrengthen its military resources for defence, while retaining political\r\npower in the hands of the burghers. Accordingly, the fortifications\r\nalready begun at Pretoria were pushed on, a strong fort was erected to\r\ncommand Johannesburg, and munitions of war were imported in very large\r\nquantities, while the Uitlanders were debarred from possessing arms.\r\nSuch precautions were natural. Any government which had been nearly\r\noverthrown, and expected another attack, would have done the like. But\r\nthese measures of course incensed the Uitlanders, who saw that another\r\ninsurrection would have less chance of success than the last, and\r\nresented the inferiority implied in disarmament, as Israel resented the\r\nsimilar policy pursued by the Philistine princes. The capitalists also,\r\nan important factor by their wealth and by their power of influencing\r\nopinion in Europe, were angry and restless, because the prospect of\r\nsecuring reforms which would reduce the cost of working the gold reefs\r\nbecame more remote.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of things in the two Republics and the British\r\nColonies when the diplomatic controversy between the Imperial Government\r\nand the South African Republic, which had been going on ever since 1895,\r\npassed in the early summer of 1899 into a more acute phase. The\r\nbeginning of that phase coincided, as it so happened, with the expiry of\r\nthe period during which the leaders of the Johannesburg rising of 1895\r\nhad promised to abstain from interference in politics, and the incident\r\nout of which it grew was the presentation to the Queen (in March 1899),\r\nthrough the High Commissioner, of a petition from a large number of\r\nBritish residents on the Witwatersrand complaining of the position in\r\nwhich they found themselves. The situation soon became one of great\r\ntension, owing to the growing passion of the English in South Africa and\r\nthe growing suspicion on the part of the Transvaal Boers. But before we\r\nspeak of the negotiations, let us consider for a moment what was the\r\nposition of the two parties to the controversy.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Transvaal Government, although (as will presently\r\nappear) it had some measure of legal strength, was, if regarded from the\r\npoint of view of actual facts, logically indefensible and materially\r\ndangerous. It was not, indeed, the fault of that Government that the\r\nrichest goldfield in the world had been discovered in its territory, nor\r\nwould it have been possible for the Boers, whatever they might have\r\nwished, to prevent the mines from being worked and the miners from\r\nstreaming in. But the course they took was condemned from the first to\r\nfailure. They desired to have the benefit of the gold-mines while yet\r\nretaining their old ways of life, not seeing that the two things were\r\nincompatible. Moreover, they--or rather the President and his\r\nadvisers--committed the fatal mistake of trying to maintain a government\r\nwhich was at the same time undemocratic and incompetent. If it had been\r\nrepresentative of the whole mass of the inhabitants it might have\r\nventured, like the governments of some great American cities, to\r\ndisregard both purity and efficiency. If, on the other hand, it had been\r\na vigorous and skilful government, giving to the inhabitants the\r\ncomforts and conveniences of municipal and industrial life at a\r\nreasonable charge, the narrow electoral basis on which it rested would\r\nhave remained little more than a theoretic grievance, and the bulk of\r\nthe people would have cared nothing for political rights. An exclusive\r\ngovernment may be pardoned if it is efficient, an inefficient government\r\nif it rests upon the people. But a government which is both inefficient\r\nand exclusive incurs a weight of odium under which it must ultimately\r\nsink; and this was the kind of government which the Transvaal attempted\r\nto maintain. They ought, therefore, to have either extended their\r\nfranchise or reformed their administration. They would not do the\r\nformer, lest the new burghers should swamp the old ones, and take the\r\ncontrol out of Boer hands. They were unfit to do the latter, because\r\nthey had neither knowledge nor skill, so that even had private interests\r\nnot stood in the way, they would have failed to create a proper\r\nadministration. It was the ignorance, as well as the exclusive spirit\r\nof the Transvaal authorities, which made them unwilling to yield any\r\nmore than they might be forced to yield to the demand for reform.\r\n\r\nThe position in which Britain stood needs to be examined from two sides,\r\nits legal right of interference, and the practical considerations which\r\njustified interference in this particular case.\r\n\r\nHer legal right rested on three grounds. The first was the Convention of\r\n1884 (printed in the Appendix to this volume), which entitled her to\r\ncomplain of any infraction of the privileges thereby guaranteed to her\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe second was the ordinary right, which every State possesses, to\r\ncomplain, and (if necessary) intervene when its subjects are wronged,\r\nand especially when they suffer any disabilities not imposed upon the\r\nsubjects of other States.\r\n\r\nThe third right was more difficult to formulate. It rested on the fact\r\nthat as Britain was the greatest power in South Africa, owning the whole\r\ncountry south of the Zambesi except the two Dutch Republics (for the\r\ndeserts of German Damaraland and the Portuguese East-coast territories\r\nmay be practically left out of account), she was interested in\r\npreventing any causes of disturbance within the Transvaal which might\r\nspread beyond its borders, and become sources of trouble either among\r\nnatives or among white men. This right was of a vague and indeterminate\r\nnature, and could be legitimately used only when it was plain that the\r\nsources of trouble did really exist and were becoming dangerous.\r\n\r\nWas there not also, it may be asked, the suzerainty of Britain, and if\r\nso, did it not justify intervention? I will not discuss the question,\r\nmuch debated by English lawyers, whether the suzerainty over the\r\n\"Transvaal State,\" mentioned in the preamble to the Convention of 1881,\r\nwas preserved over the \"South African Republic\" by the Convention of\r\n1884, not because I have been unable to reach a conclusion on the\r\nsubject, but because the point seems to be one of no practical\r\nimportance. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that there is a\r\nsuzerainty, it is perfectly clear from an examination of the Conventions\r\nand of the negotiations of 1884 that this suzerainty relates solely to\r\nforeign relations, and has nothing whatever to do with the internal\r\nconstitution or government of the Transvaal. The significance of the\r\nterm--if it be carried over and read into the Convention of 1884--is\r\nexhausted by the provision in Article IV of that instrument for the\r\nsubmission of treaties to the British Government. No argument,\r\naccordingly, for any right of interference as regards either the\r\npolitical arrangements of the Transvaal or the treatment of foreigners\r\nwithin its borders, can be founded on this real or supposed suzerainty.\r\nThis view had been too frequently and too clearly expressed by the\r\nBritish Government before 1896, to make it possible for any British\r\nofficial to attempt to put any such construction upon the term; and the\r\nmatter might therefore have been suffered to drop, since the right to\r\nveto treaties was explicit, and did not need to be supported by an\r\nappeal to the preamble of 1881. The term, however, though useless to\r\nBritain, was galling to the Transvaal, which suspected that it would be\r\nmade a pretext for infringements upon their independence in internal\r\naffairs; and these suspicions were confirmed by the talk of the\r\nUitlander spokesmen in Johannesburg, who were in the habit of appealing\r\nto Britain as the Suzerain Power. It has played a most unfortunate part\r\nin the whole controversy.\r\n\r\nSuzerainty, which is a purely legal, though somewhat vague, conception,\r\nhas in many minds become confused with the practical supremacy, or\r\nrather predominance, of Britain in South Africa, which is a totally\r\ndifferent matter. That predominance rests on the fact that Britain\r\ncommands the resources of a great empire, while the Dutch republics are\r\npetty communities of ranchmen. But it does not carry any legal rights of\r\ninterference, any more than a preponderance of force gives Germany\r\nrights against Holland.\r\n\r\nAs I have referred to the Convention of 1884, it may be well to observe\r\nthat while continuing to believe that, on a review of the facts as they\r\nthen stood, the British Government were justified in restoring\r\nself-government to the Transvaal in 1881, they seem to me to have erred\r\nin conceding the Convention of 1884. Though the Rand goldfields had not\r\nthen been discovered, Lord Derby ought to have seen that the relations\r\nof the Transvaal to the adjoining British territories would be so close\r\nthat a certain measure of British control over its internal\r\nadministration might come to be needful. This control, which was indeed\r\nbut slight, he surrendered in 1884. But the improvidence of the act does\r\nnot in the least diminish the duty of the country which made the\r\nConvention to abide by its terms, or relieve it from the obligation of\r\nmaking out for any subsequent interference a basis of law and fact which\r\nthe opinion of the world might accept as sufficient.\r\n\r\nIt has not been sufficiently realised in England that although the\r\nTransvaal may properly, in respect of British control over its foreign\r\nrelations, be described as a semi-dependent State, Britain was under the\r\nsame obligation to treat it with a strict regard to the recognised\r\nprinciples of international law as if it had been a great power. She had\r\nmade treaties with it, and those treaties it was her duty to observe.\r\nApart from all moral or sentimental considerations, apart from the fact\r\nthat Britain had at the Hague Conference been the warm and effective\r\nadvocate of peaceful methods of settling disputes between nations, it is\r\nher truest interest to set an example of fairness, legality and\r\nsincerity. No country, not even the greatest, can afford to neglect that\r\nreasonable and enlightened opinion of thoughtful men in other\r\ncountries--not to be confounded with the invective and misrepresentation\r\nemployed by the press of each nation against the others--which\r\ndetermines the ultimate judgment of the world, and passes into the\r\nverdict of history.\r\n\r\nDid then the grievances of which the British residents in the Transvaal\r\ncomplained furnish such a basis? These grievances are well known, and\r\nwill be found mentioned in chapter XXV. They were real and vexatious. It\r\nis true that some of them affected not so much British residents as the\r\nEuropean shareholders in the great mining companies; true also that the\r\nmining industry (as will be seen from the figures on p. 301) was\r\nexpanding and prospering in spite of them. Furthermore, they were\r\ngrievances under which, it might be argued, the immigrants had placed\r\nthemselves by coming with notice of their existence, and from which they\r\nmight escape by taking a train into the Free State or Natal. And they\r\nwere grievances which, however annoying, did not render either life or\r\nproperty unsafe,[1] and did not prevent the Johannesburgers from\r\nenjoying life and acquiring wealth. Nevertheless, they were such as the\r\nBritish Government was entitled to endeavour to have redressed. Nor\r\ncould it be denied that the state of irritation and unrest which\r\nprevailed on the Witwatersrand, the probability that another rising\r\nwould take place whenever a chance of success offered, furnished to\r\nBritain, interested as she was in the general peace of the country, a\r\nground for firm remonstrance and for urging the removal of all\r\nlegitimate sources of disaffection, especially as these re-acted on the\r\nwhole of South Africa. The British authorities at the Cape seem indeed\r\nto have thought that the unyielding attitude of the Transvaal Government\r\nworked much mischief in the Colony, being taken by the English there as\r\na defiance to the power and influence of Britain, and so embittering\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\nAmong the grievances most in men's mouths was the exclusion of the\r\nnew-comers from the electoral franchise. It must be clearly\r\ndistinguished from the other grievances. It was a purely internal\r\naffair, in which Britain had no right to intermeddle, either under the\r\nConvention of 1884 or under the general right of a state to protect its\r\nsubjects. Nothing is clearer than that every state may extend or limit\r\nthe suffrage as it pleases. If a British self-governing colony were to\r\nrestrict the suffrage to those who had lived fourteen years in the\r\ncolony, or a state of the American Union were to do the like, neither\r\nthe Home Government in the one case, nor the Federal Government in the\r\nother would have any right to interfere. All therefore that Britain\r\ncould do was to call the attention of the South African Republic in a\r\nfriendly way to the harm which the restriction of the franchise was\r\ncausing, and point out that to enlarge it might remove the risk of a\r\ncollision over other matters which did fall within the scope of British\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore, on a review of the whole position, led to conclude\r\nthat Britain was justified in requiring the Transvaal Government to\r\nredress the grievances (other than the limited suffrage) which were\r\ncomplained of. Whether she would be justified in proceeding to enforce\r\nby arms compliance with her demand, would of course depend upon several\r\nthings, upon the extent to which the existence of the grievances could\r\nbe disproved, upon the spirit in which the Transvaal met the demand,\r\nupon the amount of concessions offered or amendment promised. But before\r\nthe British Government entered on a course which might end in war, if\r\nthe Transvaal should prove intractable, there were some considerations\r\nwhich it was bound seriously to weigh.\r\n\r\nOne of these was the time for entering on a controversy. The Jameson\r\ninvasion was only three years old; and the passions it evoked had not\r\nsubsided. In it British officers, and troops flying the British flag, if\r\nnot Britain herself, had been wrongdoers. Suspicions of British good\r\nfaith were known to pervade the Boer mind, and would give an ominous\r\ncolour to every demand coming from Britain. The lapse of time might\r\ndiminish these suspicions, and give to negotiations a better prospect of\r\nsuccess. Time, moreover, was likely to work against the existing system\r\nof the Transvaal. Bad governments carry the seeds of their own\r\ndissolution. The reforming party among the Transvaal burghers would gain\r\nstrength, and try to throw off the existing _régime_. The President was\r\nan old man, whose retirement from power could not be long delayed; and\r\nno successor would be able to hold together as he had done the party of\r\nresistance to reform. In the strife of factions that would follow his\r\nretirement reform was certain to have a far better chance than it could\r\nhave had since 1895. In fact, to put it shortly, all the natural forces\r\nwere working for the Uitlanders, and would either open the way for their\r\nadmission to a share in power, or else make the task of Britain easier\r\nby giving her less united and therefore less formidable antagonists.\r\nThese considerations counselled a postponement of the attempt to bring\r\nmatters to a crisis.\r\n\r\nIn the second place the British Government had to remember the\r\nimportance of carrying the opinion of the Dutch in Cape Colony, and, as\r\nfar as possible, even of the Orange Free State, with them in any action\r\nthey might take. It has been pointed out how before December, 1895, that\r\nopinion blamed the Transvaal Government for its unfriendly treatment of\r\nthe immigrants. The Dutch of both communities had nothing to gain and\r\nsomething to lose by the maladministration of the Transvaal, so that\r\nthey were nowise disposed to support it in refusing reforms. The only\r\nthing that would make them rally to it would be a menace to its\r\nindependence, regarding which they, and especially the Free State\r\npeople, were extremely sensitive. Plainly, therefore, unless the\r\ncolonial Dutch were to be incensed and the Free State men turned to\r\nenemies, such a menace was to be avoided.\r\n\r\nFinally, the British authorities were bound to make sure, not only that\r\nthey had an adequate _casus belli_ which they could present to their own\r\npeople and to the world, but also that the gain to be expected from\r\nimmediately redressing the grievances of the Uitlander outweighed the\r\npermanent evils war would entail. Even where, according to the usage of\r\nnations, a just cause for war exists, even where victory in the war may\r\nbe reckoned on, the harm to be expected may be greater than the fruits\r\nof victory. Here the harm was evident. The cost of equipping a large\r\nforce and transporting it across many thousand miles of sea was the\r\nsmallest part of the harm. The alienation of more than half the\r\npopulation of Cape Colony, the destruction of a peaceful and prosperous\r\nRepublic with which Britain had no quarrel, the responsibility for\r\ngoverning the Transvaal when conquered, with its old inhabitants\r\nbitterly hostile, these were evils so grave, that the benefits to be\r\nsecured to the Uitlanders might well seem small in comparison. A nation\r\nis, no doubt, bound to protect its subjects. But it could hardly be said\r\nthat the hardships of this group of subjects, which did not prevent\r\nothers from flocking into the country, and which were no worse than they\r\nhad been for some time previously, were such as to forbid the exercise\r\nof a little more patience. It was said by the war party among the\r\nEnglish in South Africa that patience was being mistaken for weakness,\r\nand that the credit of Britain was being lowered all over the world, and\r\neven among the peoples of India, by her forbearance towards the\r\nTransvaal. Absurd as this notion may appear, it was believed by heated\r\npartizans on the spot. But outside Africa, and especially in Europe, the\r\nforbearance of one of the four greatest Powers in the world towards a\r\ncommunity of seventy thousand people was in no danger of being\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\nWhether the force of these considerations, obvious to every unbiased\r\nmind which had some knowledge of South Africa, was fully realized by\r\nthose who directed British policy, or whether, having realized their\r\nforce, they nevertheless judged war the better alternative, is a\r\nquestion on which we are still in the dark. It is possible--and some of\r\nthe language used by the British authorities may appear to suggest this\r\nexplanation--that they entered on the negotiations which ended in war in\r\nthe belief that an attitude of menace would suffice to extort\r\nsubmission, and being unable to recede from that attitude, found\r\nthemselves drawn on to a result which they had neither desired nor\r\ncontemplated. Be this as it may, the considerations above stated\r\nprescribed the use of prudent and (as far as possible) conciliatory\r\nmethods in their diplomacy, as well as care in selecting a position\r\nwhich would supply a legal justification for war, should war be found\r\nthe only issue.\r\n\r\nThis was the more necessary because the Boers were known to be intensely\r\nsuspicious. Every weak power trying to resist a stronger one must needs\r\ntake refuge in evasive and dilatory tactics. Such had been, such were\r\nsure to be, the tactics of the Boers. But the Boers were also very\r\ndistrustful of the English Government, believing it to aim at nothing\r\nless than the annexation of their country. It may seem strange to\r\nEnglishmen that the purity of their motives and the disinterestedness of\r\ntheir efforts to spread good government and raise others to their own\r\nlevel should be doubted. But the fact is--and this goes to the root of\r\nthe matter--that the Boers have regarded the policy of Britain towards\r\nthem as a policy of violence and duplicity. They recall how Natal was\r\nconquered from them in 1842, after they had conquered it from the Zulus;\r\nhow their country was annexed in 1877, how the promises made at the time\r\nof that annexation were broken. They were not appeased by the\r\nretrocession of 1881, which they ascribed solely to British fear of a\r\ncivil war in South Africa. It should moreover be remembered,--and this\r\nis a point which few people in England do remember--that they hold the\r\nannexation to have been an act of high-handed lawlessness done in time\r\nof peace, and have deemed themselves entitled to be replaced in the\r\nposition their republic held before 1877, under the Sand River\r\nConvention of 1852. Since the invasion of December 1895, they have been\r\nmore suspicious than ever, for they believe the British Government to\r\nhave had a hand in that attempt, and they think that influential\r\ncapitalists have been sedulously scheming against them. Their passion\r\nfor independence is something which we in modern Europe find it hard to\r\nrealise. It recalls the long struggle of the Swiss for freedom in the\r\nfourteenth century, or the fierce tenacity which the Scotch showed in\r\nthe same age in their resistance to the claim of England to be their\r\n\"Suzerain Power.\" This passion was backed by two other sentiments, an\r\nexaggerated estimate of their own strength and a reliance on the\r\nprotecting hand of Providence, fitter for the days of the Maccabees or\r\nof Cromwell than for our own time, but which will appear less strange if\r\nthe perils through which their nation had passed be remembered.\r\n\r\nThese were the rocks among which the bark of British diplomacy had to be\r\nsteered. They were, however, rocks above water, so it might be hoped\r\nthat war could be avoided and some valuable concession secured. To be\r\nlanded in war would obviously be as great a failure as to secure no\r\nconcession.\r\n\r\nInstead of demanding the removal of the specific grievances whereof the\r\nUitlanders complained, the British Government resolved to endeavour to\r\nobtain for them an easier acquisition of the electoral franchise and an\r\nampler representation in the legislature. There was much to be said for\r\nthis course. It would avoid the tedious and vexatious controversies that\r\nmust have arisen over the details of the grievances. It would (in the\r\nlong run) secure reform in the best way, viz., by the action of public\r\nspirit and enlightenment within the legislature. It would furnish a\r\nbasis for union between the immigrants and the friends of good\r\ngovernment among the burghers themselves, and so conduce to the future\r\npeace of the community. There was, however, one material condition, a\r\ncondition which might prove to be an objection, affecting the resort to\r\nit. Since the electoral franchise was a matter entirely within the\r\ncompetence of the South African Republic, Britain must, if she desired\r\nto abide by the principles of international law, confine herself to\r\nrecommendation and advice. She had no right to demand, no right to\r\ninsist that her advice should be followed. She could not compel\r\ncompliance by force, nor even by the threat of using force. In other\r\nwords, a refusal to enlarge the franchise would not furnish any _casus\r\nbelli_.\r\n\r\nThis course having been adopted, the negotiations entered on a new phase\r\nwith the Conference at Bloemfontein, where President Kruger met the\r\nBritish High Commissioner. Such a direct interchange of views between\r\nthe leading representatives of two Powers may often be expedient,\r\nbecause it helps the parties to get sooner to close quarters with the\r\nsubstantial points of difference, and so facilitates a compromise. But\r\nits utility depends on two conditions. Either the basis of discussion\r\nshould be arranged beforehand, leaving only minor matters to be\r\nadjusted, or else the proceedings should be informal and private. At\r\nBloemfontein neither condition existed. No basis had been previously\r\narranged. The Conference was formal and (although the press were not\r\nadmitted) virtually public, each party speaking before the world, each\r\nwatched and acclaimed by its supporters over the country. The eyes of\r\nSouth Africa were fixed on Bloemfontein, so that when the Conference\r\ncame to its unfruitful end, the two parties were practically further off\r\nthan before, and their failure to agree accentuated the bitterness both\r\nof the Transvaal Boers and of the English party in the Colonies. To the\r\nmore extreme men among the latter this result was welcome. There was\r\nalready a war party in the Colony, and voices clamorous for war were\r\nheard in the English press. Both then and afterwards every check to the\r\nnegotiations evoked a burst of joy from organs of opinion at home and in\r\nthe Cape, whose articles were unfortunately telegraphed to Pretoria.\r\nWorse still, the cry of \"Avenge Majuba\" was frequently heard in the\r\nColonies, and sometimes even in England.\r\n\r\nThe story of the negotiations which followed during the months of July,\r\nAugust and September, cannot be told fully here, because it is long and\r\nintricate, nor summarized, because the fairness of any summary not\r\nsupported by citations would be disputed. There are, however, some\r\nphenomena in the process of drifting towards war which may be concisely\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nOne of these is that the contending parties were at one moment all but\r\nagreed. The Transvaal Government offered to give the suffrage after five\r\nyears residence (which was what had been asked by the High Commissioner\r\nat Bloemfontein) coupled with certain conditions, which had little\r\nimportance, and were afterwards so explained as to have even less. This\r\nwas, from their point of view, a great concession, one to which they\r\nexpected opposition from the more conservative section of their own\r\nburghers. The British negotiators, though they have since stated that\r\nthey meant substantially to accept this proposal, sent a reply whose\r\ntreatment of the conditions was understood as a refusal, and which\r\nappeared to raise further questions; and when the Transvaal went back to\r\na previous offer, which had previously been held to furnish a basis for\r\nagreement, the British Government declined to recur to that basis, as\r\nbeing no longer tenable after the later offer. The Boers, who had\r\nexpected (from informal communications) that the five years offer would\r\nbe readily accepted, seem to have thought that there was no longer any\r\nchance of a settlement, because fresh demands would follow each\r\nconcession. They ought, however, to have persevered with their five\r\nyears offer, which they could the more easily have done because they had\r\ntacitly dropped the unsustainable claim to be a \"sovereign and\r\nindependent state,\" and expressed themselves ready to abide by the\r\nConvention of 1884. The British Government, on its part, would seem to\r\nhave thought, when the five years offer was withdrawn because the\r\nconditions attached to it were not accepted, that the Boers had been\r\ntrifling with them, and resolved to exact all they demanded, even though\r\nless than all would have represented a diplomatic victory. Thus a\r\nconflict was precipitated which a more cautious and tactful policy might\r\nhave avoided.\r\n\r\nThe controversy continued through three months to turn on the question\r\nof the franchise, nor were any demands for the redress of Uitlander\r\ngrievances ever formulated and addressed to the Transvaal either under\r\nthe Convention of 1884 or in respect of the general rights at\r\ninternational law which Britain possessed. When the franchise\r\nnegotiations came to an _impasse_, the British Government announced\r\n(September 22nd) that their demands and scheme for a \"final settlement\r\nof the issues created by the policy of the Republic\"--a phrase which\r\npointed to something more than the redress of grievances--would be\r\npresented to the Republic. These demands, however, never were presented\r\nat all. After an interval of seventeen days from the announcement just\r\nmentioned, the Transvaal declared war (October 9th and 11th). The terms\r\nof their ultimatum were offensive and peremptory, such as no Government\r\ncould have been expected to listen to. Apart, however, from the language\r\nof the ultimatum, a declaration of war must have been looked for. From\r\nthe middle of July the British Government had been strengthening its\r\ngarrison in South Africa, and the despatch of one body of troops after\r\nanother had been proclaimed with much emphasis in the English\r\nnewspapers. Early in October it was announced that the Reserves would be\r\ncalled out and a powerful force despatched. The Transvaal had meantime\r\nbeen also preparing for war, so that the sending of British troops might\r\nwell, after the beginning of September, be justified as a necessary\r\nprecaution, since the forces then in South Africa were inferior in\r\nnumbers to those the Boers could muster. But when the latter knew that\r\nan overwhelming force would soon confront them, and draw round them a\r\nnet of steel, whence they could not escape, they resolved to seize the\r\nonly advantage they possessed, the advantage of time, and to smite\r\nbefore their enemy was ready. It was therefore, only in a technical or\r\nformal sense that they can be said to have begun the war; for a weak\r\nState, which sees its enemy approach with a power that will soon be\r\nirresistible, has only two alternatives, to submit or to attack at once.\r\nIn such a quarrel the responsibility does not necessarily rest with\r\nthose who strike first. It rests with those whose action has made\r\nbloodshed inevitable.\r\n\r\nA singular result of the course things took was that war broke out\r\nbefore any legitimate _casus belli_ had arisen. Some one has observed\r\nthat whereas many wars have been waged to gain subjects, none was ever\r\nwaged before to get rid of subjects by making it easier for them to pass\r\nunder another allegiance. The franchise, however, did not constitute a\r\nlegitimate cause of war, for the British Government always admitted they\r\nhad no right to demand it. The real cause of war was the menacing\r\nlanguage of Britain, coupled with her preparations for war. These led\r\nthe Boers also to arm, and, as happened with the arming and\r\ncounter-arming of Prussia and Austria in 1866, when each expected an\r\nattack from the other, war inevitably followed. To brandish the sword\r\nbefore a cause for war has been shown not only impairs the prospect of a\r\npeaceful settlement, but may give the world ground for believing that\r\nwar is intended.\r\n\r\nBy making the concession of the franchise the aim of their efforts, and\r\nsupporting it by demonstrations which drove their antagonist to arms,\r\nthe British Government placed themselves before the world in the\r\nposition of having caused a war without ever formulating a _casus\r\nbelli_, and thereby exposed their country to unfavourable comment from\r\nother nations. The British negotiators were, it may be said, placed in a\r\ndilemma by the distance which separated their army from South Africa,\r\nand which obliged them to move troops earlier than they need otherwise\r\nhave done, even at the risk (which, however, they do not seem to have\r\nfully grasped) of precipitating war. But this difficulty might have been\r\navoided in one of two ways. They might have pressed their suggestion for\r\nan extension of the franchise in an amicable way, without threats and\r\nwithout moving troops, and have thereby kept matters from coming to a\r\ncrisis. Or, on the other hand, if they thought that the doggedness of\r\nthe Transvaal would yield to nothing but threats, they might have\r\nformulated demands, not for the franchise, but for the redress of\r\ngrievances, demands the refusal or evasion of which would constitute a\r\nproper cause of war, and have, simultaneously with the presentation of\r\nthose demands, sent to South Africa a force sufficient at least for the\r\ndefence of their own territory. The course actually taken missed the\r\nadvantages of either of these courses. It brought on war before the\r\nColonies were in a due state of defence, and it failed to justify war by\r\nshowing any cause for it such as the usage of civilized States\r\nrecognizes.\r\n\r\nAs Cavour said that any one can govern with a state of siege, so strong\r\nPowers dealing with weak ones are prone to think that any kind of\r\ndiplomacy will do. The British Government, confident in its strength,\r\nseems to have overlooked not only the need for taking up a sound legal\r\nposition, but the importance of retaining the good will of the Colonial\r\nDutch, and of preventing the Orange Free State from taking sides with\r\nthe Transvaal. This was sure to happen if Britain was, or seemed to be,\r\nthe aggressor. Now the British Government by the attitude of menace it\r\nadopted while discussing the franchise question, which furnished no\r\ncause for war, by the importance it seemed to attach to the utterances\r\nof the body calling itself the Uitlander Council in Johannesburg (a body\r\nwhich was in the strongest opposition to the Transvaal authorities), as\r\nwell as by other methods scarcely consistent with diplomatic usage, led\r\nboth the Transvaal and the Free State to believe that they meant to\r\npress matters to extremities, and that much more than the franchise or\r\nthe removal of certain grievances was involved; in fact, that the\r\nindependence of the Republic itself was at stake.[2]\r\n\r\nThey cannot have intended this, and indeed they expressly disclaimed\r\ndesigns on the independence of the Transvaal. Nevertheless the Free\r\nState, when it saw negotiations stopped after September 22nd, and an\r\noverwhelming British force ordered to South Africa while the proposals\r\nforeshadowed in the despatch of September 22nd remained undisclosed,\r\nbecame convinced that Britain meant to crush the Transvaal. Being bound\r\nby treaty to support the Transvaal if the latter was unjustly attacked,\r\nand holding the conduct of Britain in refusing arbitration and resorting\r\nto force without a _casus belli_ to constitute an unjust attack, the\r\nFree State Volksraad and burghers, who had done their utmost to avert\r\nwar, unhesitatingly threw in their lot with the sister Republic. The act\r\nwas desperate, but it was chivalric. The Free State, hitherto happy,\r\nprosperous and peaceful, had nothing to gain and everything to lose. Few\r\nof her statesmen can have doubted that Britain must prevail and that\r\ntheir Republic would share the ruin which awaited the Transvaal Dutch.\r\nNevertheless honour and the sense of kinship prevailed. It is to be\r\nhoped that the excited language in which the passionate feelings of the\r\nFree State have found expression will not prevent Englishmen from\r\nrecognizing in the conduct of this little community a heroic quality\r\nwhich they would admire if they met it in the annals of ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the question of responsibility for the war is\r\nreally a trivial one, because the negotiations were all along, on one\r\nside or on both, unreal and delusive, masking the conviction of both\r\nparties that they must come to blows at last. It is said that a conflict\r\nfor supremacy between the English and Dutch races in South Africa was\r\ninevitable, and it is even alleged that there was a long-standing\r\nconspiracy among the Dutch, as well in the Colonies as in the Republics,\r\nto overmaster the British element and oust Britain from the country.\r\n\r\nOn this hypothesis several observations may be made.\r\n\r\nOne is that it seems to be an afterthought, intended to excuse the\r\nfailure of diplomacy to untie the knot. No one who studies the\r\ndespatches can think that either the Transvaal Government or the British\r\nGovernment regarded war as inevitable when the one made, and the other\r\nsent a reply intended to accept, the proposals of August 19th. Nothing\r\nis easier than to bring charges of bad faith, but he who peruses these\r\ndespatches with an impartial mind will find little or nothing to justify\r\nany such imputation on either party. Another is, that the allegation\r\nthat a calamity was inevitable is one so easy to make and so hard to\r\nrefute that it is constantly employed to close an embarrassing\r\ndiscussion. You cannot argue with a fatalist, any more than with a\r\nprophet. Nations whose conscience is clear, statesmen who have foresight\r\nand insight, do not throw the blame for their failures upon Destiny. The\r\nchieftain in Homer, whose folly has brought disaster, says, \"It is not I\r\nwho am the cause of this: it is Zeus, and Fate, and the Fury that\r\nwalketh in darkness.\" \"It could not have been helped anyhow,\" \"It was\r\nbound to come\"--phrases such as these are the last refuge of despairing\r\nincompetence.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that the Dutch all over South Africa were leagued for the\r\noverthrow of British power is so startling that it needs to be supported\r\nby wide and weighty evidence. Is such evidence forthcoming? It has not\r\nbeen produced. One who has not been in South Africa since 1895 dare not\r\nrely on his own observation to deny the allegation. But neither can\r\nEnglishmen at home accept the assertions of partisans in South Africa,\r\nthe extravagance of whose language shows that they have been carried\r\naway by party passion.\r\n\r\nThe probabilities of the case are altogether against the hypothesis, and\r\nsupport the view of a temperate writer in the _Edinburgh Review_ for\r\nOctober, who describes it as \"a nightmare.\" What are these\r\nprobabilities?\r\n\r\nThe Dutch in the Cape had been loyal till December 1895, and had indeed\r\nbeen growing more and more loyal during the last fifteen years. The\r\nAfricander Bond had shaken itself free from the suspicions once\r\nentertained of its designs. Its leader, Mr. Hofmeyr, was conspicuously\r\nattached to the Imperial connection, and was, indeed, the author of a\r\nwell-known scheme for an Imperial Customs Union. Even after December,\r\n1895, its indignation at the attack on the Transvaal had not affected\r\nthe veneration of the Dutch party for the British Crown, so warmly\r\nexpressed in 1897. In 1898 the Cape Assembly, in which there was a Dutch\r\nmajority led by a Ministry supported by the Bond, voted unanimously a\r\nlarge annual contribution to Imperial naval defence. Every effort was\r\nmade by Mr. Hofmeyr and by the Prime Minister of the Cape to induce the\r\nTransvaal to make concessions which might avert war. As regards the Free\r\nState, its Dutch burghers had been for many years on the best terms with\r\ntheir English fellow-burghers and with the British Government. They had\r\nnothing to gain by a racial conflict, and their President, who is\r\nunderstood to have suggested the Bloemfontein Conference, as well as Mr.\r\nFischer, one of their leading statesmen, strove hard to secure peace\r\ntill immediately before war broke out.\r\n\r\nThere was, moreover, no prospect of success for an effort to overthrow\r\nthe power of Britain. The Dutch in the Colony were not fighting men\r\nlike their Transvaal brethren, and were, except for voting purposes,\r\nquite unorganized. Those of the Free State were a mere militia, with no\r\nexperience of war, and had possessed, at least down to 1895, when I\r\nremember to have seen their tiny arsenal, very little in the way of war\r\nmunitions. The Transvaal Boers were no doubt well armed and good\r\nfighters, but there were after all only some twenty or twenty-five\r\nthousand of them, a handful to contend against the British Empire. The\r\nTransvaal Government was, moreover, from its structure and the capacity\r\nof the men who composed it, if not indisposed to indulge in day-dreams,\r\nat any rate unfit to prosecute so vast an enterprise.\r\n\r\nThere seems therefore to be no foundation in any facts which have so far\r\nbeen made public for the belief in this \"conspiracy of the Dutch race,\"\r\nor for the inevitableness of the imagined conflict.\r\n\r\nThe truth would appear to be that the Transvaal people did at one time\r\ncherish the hope of extending their Republic over the wide interior.\r\nThey were stopped on the west in 1884. They were stopped on the north in\r\n1890. They were stopped in their effort to reach the sea in 1894. After\r\nthat year British territory surrounded them on all sides except where\r\nthey bordered the Portuguese on the north-east. Many of them, including\r\nthe President, doubtless cherished the hope of some time regaining a\r\ncomplete independence such as that of the Free State. Some ardent\r\nspirits dreamt of a Dutch South African Republic with Pretoria for its\r\nfuture capital; and there were probably a few men of the same visionary\r\ntype in the Colony and the Free State who talked in the same wild way,\r\nespecially after the Jameson invasion had stirred Dutch feeling to its\r\ndepths. But from such dreams and such talk it is a long step to a\r\n\"conspiracy of the Dutch over all South Africa.\" The possibility that\r\nthe Dutch element would some day or other prevail, a possibility to\r\nwhich the slowness of British immigration and the natural growth of the\r\nDutch population gave a certain substance in it down to 1885, was in\r\nthat year destroyed by the discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand, which\r\nbrought a new host of English-speaking settlers into South Africa, and\r\nassured the numerical and economic preponderance of the English in the\r\nprogressive and expanding regions of the country. It is also true that\r\nthe Transvaal Government made military preparations and imported arms on\r\na large scale. They expected a rising even before 1895; and after 1895\r\nthey also expected a fresh invasion. But there is not, so far as the\r\npublic know, any shred of evidence that they contemplated an attack upon\r\nBritain. The needs of defence, a defence in which they doubtless counted\r\non the aid of the Free State and of a section of their own Uitlanders,\r\nsufficiently explain the accumulation of warlike munitions on which so\r\nmuch stress has been laid.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion to which an examination of the matter leads is that no\r\nevidence whatever has been produced either that there was any such\r\nconspiracy as alleged, or that a conflict between Dutch and English was\r\ninevitable. Such a conflict might, no doubt, have possibly some day\r\narisen. But it is at least equally probable that it might have been\r\navoided. The Transvaal people were not likely to provoke it, and every\r\nyear made it less likely that they could do so with any chance of\r\nsuccess. The British element was increasing, not only around their\r\nState, but within it. The prospect of support from a great European\r\nPower had vanished. When their aged President retired from the scene,\r\ntheir old dissensions, held in check only by the fear of Britain, would\r\nhave reappeared, and their vicious system of government would have\r\nfallen to pieces. So far as Britain was concerned, the way to avert a\r\nconflict was to have patience. Haste had been her bane in South Africa.\r\nIt was haste which annexed the Transvaal in 1877, when a few months'\r\ndelay might have given her the country. It was haste which in 1880\r\nwrecked the plan of South African Confederation. It was haste which\r\nbrought about that main source of recent troubles, the invasion by the\r\nSouth Africa Company's police in 1895.\r\n\r\nIn these reflections upon recent events nothing has been said, because\r\nnothing could now be profitably said, upon two aspects of the\r\nmatter--the character and conduct of the persons chiefly concerned, and\r\nthe subterranean forces which are supposed to have been at work on both\r\nsides. These must be left to some future historian, and they will form\r\nan interesting chapter in his book. He will have proof positive of many\r\nthings which can now only be conjectured, and of some things which,\r\nthough they may be known to a few, ought not to be stated until proof of\r\nthem can be produced.\r\n\r\nIt is right, however, even while war is raging, to consider the\r\ncircumstances that have led to war, so far as these can be discussed\r\nfrom the information which we all possess, because a fair consideration\r\nof those circumstances ought to influence the view which Englishmen take\r\nof their antagonists, and ought to affect their judgment of the measures\r\nproper to be taken when war comes to its end, and arrangements have to\r\nbe made for the resettlement of the country. Those who have read the\r\nhistorical chapters of this book, and have reflected on the history of\r\nother British colonies, and particularly of Canada, will have drawn the\r\nmoral, which I have sought to enforce in the concluding chapter, that\r\nwhat South Africa most needs is the reconcilement and ultimate fusion of\r\nthe two white races. Reconcilement and fusion have now, to all\r\nappearances, been thrown back into a dim and distant future. That man\r\nmust be sanguine indeed who expects, as some persons say they do expect,\r\nto see the relations of the two races placed on a better footing by a\r\nbitter war between them, a war which has many of the incidents of a\r\ncivil war, and is waged on one side by citizen soldiers. To most\r\nobservers it seems more likely to sow a crop of dragon's teeth which\r\nwill produce a harvest, if not of armed men, yet of permanent hatred and\r\ndisaffection. Nevertheless, even at the darkest moment, men must work\r\nwith hope for the future, and strive to apply the principles of policy\r\nwhich experience has approved. The first principle which governs the\r\nrelation of Britain to her self-governing colonies is that she must do\r\nall she can to keep them contented and loyal. She cannot hope\r\npermanently to retain any which have become disloyal, and the defection\r\nof one may be the signal for the loosening of the tie which binds the\r\nothers. The gift of self-government practically makes the maintenance of\r\nthe Imperial connection dependent on the will of the colony; and where\r\nself-government exists, voting is more powerful than arms. The Transvaal\r\nRepublic has been often troublesome, but an unfriendly neighbour is less\r\ndangerous than a disaffected colony. A wise policy will therefore use\r\nwith moderation the opportunities which the conclusion of the present\r\nwar will afford for resettling the political arrangements of the\r\ncountry, remembering that the Dutch and British races have got to live\r\ntogether, looking forward to a time, probably less than a century\r\ndistant, when the exhaustion of mineral wealth will have made South\r\nAfrica again a pastoral and agricultural country, and thereby increased\r\nthe importance, relatively to the town-dwelling English, of that Dutch\r\nelement which is so deeply rooted in the soil. To reconcile the races by\r\nemploying all the natural and human forces which make for peace and\r\nrender the prosperity of each the prosperity of both, and so to pave the\r\nway for the ultimate fusion of Dutchman and Englishman in a common\r\nImperial as well as a common Africander patriotism--this should be the\r\naim of every government that seeks to base the world-wide greatness of\r\nBritain on the deepest and surest foundations.\r\n\r\n_October 23rd, 1899._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Whatever may be thought as to the much controverted Edgar\r\ncase, the fact that such special stress has been laid on it, and that\r\nfew, if any, other cases have been instanced in which crimes against\r\nUitlanders went unpunished, goes to show that life was exposed only to\r\nthose dangers which threaten it in all new mining communities.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The language of the English newspapers in Cape Colony, and\r\nof some in London, did as much to strengthen this belief as the language\r\nof the Transvaal papers did to inflame minds there.

Brown for\r\nthe permission kindly given me to use the maps in the excellent \"Guide\r\nto South Africa\" (published by the Castle Mail Packets Company) in the\r\npreparation of the three maps contained in this volume; and I trust that\r\nthese maps will prove helpful to the reader, for a comprehension of the\r\nphysical geography of the country is essential to a comprehension of its\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe friends in South Africa to whom I am indebted for many of the facts\r\nI have stated and views I have expressed are too numerous to mention:\r\nbut I cannot deny myself the pleasure of returning thanks for the genial\r\nhospitality and unfailing kindness which I received in every part of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n_September 13th, 1897._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPS AT END OF

year 1895 I travelled across South Africa from\r\nCape Town to Fort Salisbury in Mashonaland, passing through Bechuanaland\r\nand Matibililand. From Fort Salisbury, which is only two hundred miles\r\nfrom the Zambesi, I returned through Manicaland and the Portuguese\r\nterritories to Beira on the Indian Ocean, sailed thence to Delagoa Bay\r\nand Durban, traversed Natal, and visited the Transvaal, the Orange Free\r\nState, Basutoland, and the eastern province Cape Colony. The country had\r\nlong possessed a great interest for me, and that interest was increased\r\nby studying on the spot its physical character as well as the peculiar\r\neconomic and industrial conditions which have made it unlike the other\r\nnewly settled countries of the world. Seeing these things and talking\r\nwith the leading men in every part of the country, I began to comprehend\r\nmany things that had previously been obscure to me, and saw how the\r\npolitical troubles of the land were connected with the life which nature\r\nimposed on the people. Immediately after my return to Europe, fresh\r\npolitical troubles broke out, and events occurred in the Transvaal which\r\nfixed the eyes of the whole world upon South Africa. I had not travelled\r\nwith the view of writing a book; but the interest which the events just\r\nmentioned have aroused, and which is likely to be sustained for a good\r\nwhile to come, leads me to believe that the impressions of a traveller\r\nwho has visited other new countries may be useful to those who desire to\r\nknow what South Africa is really like, and why it makes a noise and\r\nstir in the world disproportionate to its small population.\r\n\r\nI have called the book \"Impressions\" lest it should be supposed that I\r\nhave attempted to present a complete and minute account of the country.\r\nFor this a long residence and a large volume would be required. It is\r\nthe salient features that I wish to describe. These, after all, are what\r\nmost readers desire to know: these are what the traveller of a few weeks\r\nor months can give, and can give all the better because the details have\r\nnot become so familiar to him as to obscure the broad outlines.\r\n\r\nInstead of narrating my journey, and weaving into the narrative\r\nobservations on the country and people, I have tried to arrange the\r\nmaterials collected in a way better fitted to present to the reader in\r\ntheir natural connection the facts he will desire to have. Those facts\r\nwould seem to be the following: (1) the physical character of the\r\ncountry, and the aspects of its scenery; (2) the characteristics of the\r\nnative races that inhabit it; (3) the history of the natives and of the\r\nEuropean settlers, that is to say the chief events which have made the\r\npeople what they now are; (4) the present condition of the several\r\ndivisions of the country, and the aspects of life in it; (5) the\r\neconomic resources of the country, and the characteristic features of\r\nits society and its politics.\r\n\r\nThese I have tried to set forth in the order above indicated. The first\r\nseven chapters contain a very brief account of the physical structure\r\nand climate, since these are the conditions which have chiefly\r\ndetermined the economic progress of the country and the lines of\r\nEuropean migration, together with remarks on the wild animals, the\r\nvegetation, and the scenery. Next follows a sketch of the three\r\naboriginal races, and an outline of the history of the whites since\r\ntheir first arrival, four centuries ago. The earlier events are lightly\r\ntouched on, while those which have brought about the present political\r\nsituation are more fully related. In the third part of the book, asking\r\nthe reader to accompany me on the long journey from Cape Town to the\r\nZambesi Valley and back again, I have given in four chapters a\r\ndescription of the far interior as one sees it passing from barbarism to\r\ncivilization--its scenery, the prospects of its material development,\r\nthe life which its new settlers lead. These regions, being the part of\r\nthe country most lately brought under European administration, seem to\r\ndeserve a fuller treatment than the older and better-known regions.\r\nThree other chapters give a more summary account of Natal, of the\r\nTransvaal gold-fields, of that model republic the Orange Free State, and\r\nof Basutoland, a native state under British protection which possesses\r\nmany features of peculiar interest. In the fourth and last division of\r\nthe book several questions of a more general character are dealt with\r\nwhich could not conveniently be brought into either the historical or\r\nthe descriptive parts. I have selected for discussion those topics which\r\nare of most permanent importance and as to which the reader is most\r\nlikely to be curious. Among them are the condition of the natives, and\r\ntheir relations to the white people; the aspects of social and political\r\nlife; the situation of affairs in the Transvaal in 1895, and the causes\r\nwhich brought about the Reform rising and the expedition of Dr. Jameson;\r\nand finally, the economic prospects of the country, and the political\r\nfuture of its colonies and republics.\r\n\r\nIn these concluding chapters, as well as in the historical sketch, my\r\naim has been to set forth and explain facts rather than to pass\r\njudgments upon the character and conduct of individuals. Whoever desires\r\nto help others to a fair view of current events must try not only to be\r\nimpartial, but also to avoid expressing opinions when the grounds for\r\nthose opinions cannot be fully stated; and where controversy is raging\r\nround the events to be described, no judgment passed on individual\r\nactors could fail to be deemed partial by one set of partizans or by the\r\nother. Feeling sure that the present problems will take some time to\r\nsolve, I have sought to write what those who desire to understand the\r\ncountry may find useful even after the next few years have passed. And,\r\nso far from wishing to champion any view or to throw any fresh logs on\r\nthe fire of controversy that has been blazing for the last few years, I\r\nam convinced that the thing now most needed in the interests of South\r\nAfrica is to let controversies die out, to endeavour to forget the\r\ncauses of irritation, and to look at the actual facts of the case in a\r\npurely practical spirit.\r\n\r\nAltogether apart from its recent troubles, South Africa is an\r\ninteresting, and indeed fascinating subject of study. There are, of\r\ncourse, some things which one cannot expect to find in it. There has not\r\nyet been time to evolve institutions either novel or specially\r\ninstructive, nor to produce new types of character (save that of the\r\nTransvaal Boer) or new forms of social life. There are no ancient\r\nbuildings, except a few prehistoric ruins; nor have any schools of\r\narchitecture or painting or literature been as yet developed. But\r\nbesides the aspects of nature, often weird and sometimes beautiful,\r\nthere are the savage races, whose usages and superstitions open a wide\r\nfield for research, and the phenomena of whose contact with the whites\r\nraise some grave and gloomy problems. There are the relations of the two\r\nEuropean races--races which ought long ago to have been happily blended\r\ninto one, but which have been kept apart by a train of untoward events\r\nand administrative errors. Few of the newer countries have had a more\r\npeculiar or more chequered history; and this history needs to be studied\r\nwith a constant regard to the physical conditions that have moulded it.\r\nComing down to our own time, nowhere are the struggles of the past seen\r\nto be more closely intertwined with the troubles of the present; nor\r\ndoes even Irish history furnish a better illustration of the effect of\r\nsentiment upon practical politics. Few events of recent times have\r\npresented more dramatic situations, and raised more curious and\r\nintricate issues of political and international morality, than those\r\nwhich have lately been set before us by the discovery of the Transvaal\r\ngold-fields and the rush of nineteenth-century miners and speculators\r\ninto a pastoral population which retains the ideas and habits of the\r\nseventeenth-century. Still more fascinating are the problems of the\r\nfuture. One can as yet do little more than guess at them; but the world\r\nnow moves so fast, and has grown so small, and sees nearly every part of\r\nitself so closely bound by ties of commerce or politics to every other\r\npart, that it is impossible to meditate on any great and new country\r\nwithout seeking to interpret its tendencies by the experience of other\r\ncountries, and to conjecture the rôle it will be called on to play in\r\nthe world-drama of the centuries to come. I have sought, therefore, not\r\nonly to make South Africa real to those who do not know it, and to give\r\nthem the materials for understanding what passes there and following its\r\nfortunes with intelligence, but also to convey an impression of the kind\r\nof interest it awakens. It is still new: and one sees still in a fluid\r\nstate the substance that will soon crystallize into new forms. One\r\nspeculates on the result which these mingled forces, these ethnic habits\r\nand historical traditions, and economic conditions, will work out. And\r\nreflecting on all these things, one feels sure that a country with so\r\ncommanding a position, and which has compressed so much history into the\r\nlast eighty years of its life, will hold a conspicuous place in that\r\nsouthern hemisphere which has in our own times entered into the\r\npolitical and industrial life of the civilized world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n_NATURE_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL FEATURES\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the material resources and economic conditions of South\r\nAfrica, and, indeed, to understand the history of the country and the\r\npolitical problems which it now presents, one must first know something\r\nof its physical structure. The subject may seem dry, and those readers\r\nwho do not care for it may skip this chapter. But it need not be\r\nuninteresting, and it is certainly not uninstructive. For myself, I can\r\nsay that not only South African history, but also the prospects of South\r\nAfrican industry and trade, were dark matters to me till I had got, by\r\ntravelling through the country, an idea of those natural features of the\r\nsouthern part of the continent which have so largely governed the course\r\nof events and have stamped themselves so deeply upon the habits of the\r\npeople. Some notion of these features I must now try to convey.\r\nFortunately, they are simple, for nature has worked in Africa, as in\r\nAmerica, upon larger and broader lines than she has done in Europe. The\r\nreader will do well to keep a map beside him, and refer[3] constantly to\r\nit, for descriptions without a map avail little.\r\n\r\nAfrica south of the Zambesi River consists, speaking broadly, of three\r\nregions. There is a strip of lowland lying along the coast of the Indian\r\nOcean, all the way round from Cape Town, past Durban and Delagoa Bay and\r\nBeira, till you reach the mouth of the Zambesi. On the south, between\r\nCape Town and Durban, this strip is often very narrow, for in many\r\nplaces the hills come, as they do at Cape Town, right down to the sea.\r\nBut beyond Durban, as one follows the coast along to the north-east, the\r\nlevel strip widens. At Delagoa Bay it is some fifteen or twenty miles\r\nwide; at Beira it is sixty or eighty miles wide, so that the hills\r\nbehind cannot be seen from the coast; and farther north it is still\r\nwider. This low strip is in many places wet and swampy, and, being\r\nswampy, is from Durban northward malarious and unhealthful in the\r\nhighest degree. Its unhealthfulness is a factor of prime importance in\r\nwhat may be called the general scheme of the country, and has had, as we\r\nshall presently see, the most important historical consequences.\r\n\r\nBehind the low coast strip rise the hills whose slopes constitute the\r\nsecond region. They rise in most places rather gradually, and they\r\nseldom (except in Manicaland, to be hereafter described) present\r\nstriking forms. The neighbourhood of Cape Town is almost the only place\r\nwhere high mountains come close to the shore--the only place, therefore,\r\nexcept the harbour of St. John's far to the east, where there is\r\nanything that can be called grand coast scenery. As one travels inland\r\nthe hills become constantly higher, till at a distance of thirty or\r\nforty miles from the sea they have reached an average height of from\r\n3000 to 4000 feet, and sixty miles from 5000 to 6000 feet. These hills,\r\nintersected by valleys which grow narrower and have steeper sides the\r\nfarther inland one goes, are the spurs or outer declivity of a long\r\nrange of mountains which runs all the way from Cape Town to the Zambesi\r\nValley, a distance of sixteen hundred miles, and is now usually called\r\nby geographers (for it has really no general name) the Drakensberg or\r\nQuathlamba Range. Their height varies from 3000 to 7000 feet, some of\r\nthe highest lying not far to the north-east of Cape Town. In one region,\r\nhowever, several summits reach to 11,000 feet. This is Basutoland, the\r\ncountry that lies at the corner where Cape Colony, Natal, and the Orange\r\nFree State meet. It is a region remarkable in several respects, for its\r\nscenery as well as for its history, and for the condition of the native\r\nrace that inhabits it, and I shall have to give some account of it in a\r\nlater chapter. These mountains of Basutoland are the loftiest in Africa\r\nsouth of Kilimandjaro, and keep snow on their summits for several months\r\nin the year.\r\n\r\nBehind the Quathlamba Range the country spreads out to the north and\r\nwest in a vast tableland, sometimes flat, sometimes undulating,\r\nsometimes intersected by ridges of rocky hills. This is the third\r\nregion. Its average height above the sea varies from 3000 to 5000 feet,\r\nand the hills reach in places nearly 6000. Thus the Quathlamba Range may\r\nbe regarded as being really the edge of the tableland, and when in\r\ntravelling up from the coast one reaches the water-shed, or \"divide\" (an\r\nAmerican term which South Africans have adopted), one finds that on the\r\nfarther or northerly side there is very little descent. The peaks which\r\nwhen seen from the slopes towards the coast looked high and steep are on\r\nthis inner side insignificant, because they rise so little above the\r\ngeneral level of the plateau. This plateau runs away inland to the west\r\nand north-west, and occupies seven-eighths of the surface of South\r\nAfrica. It dips gently on the north to the valley of the Zambesi; but on\r\nthe west spreads out over the Kalahari Desert and the scarcely less arid\r\nwastes of Damaraland, maintaining (except along the lower course of the\r\nOrange River) an altitude of from 3000 to 4000 feet above the sea, until\r\nwithin a comparatively short distance of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe physical structure of the country is thus extremely simple. There is\r\nonly one considerable mountain-chain, with a vast table-land filling the\r\ninterior behind it, and a rough, hilly country lying between the\r\nmountains and the low belt which borders on the Indian Ocean. Let the\r\nreader suppose himself to be a traveller wishing to cross the continent\r\nfrom east to west. Starting from a port, say Delagoa Bay or Beira, on\r\nthe Portuguese coast, the traveller will in a few hours, by either of\r\nthe railways which run westward from those ports, traverse the low strip\r\nwhich divides them from the hill-country. To ascend the valleys and\r\ncross the water-shed of the great Quathlamba Range on to the plateau\r\ntakes a little longer, yet no great time. Then, once upon the plateau,\r\nthe traveller may proceed steadily to the west for more than a thousand\r\nmiles over an enormous stretch of high but nearly level land, meeting no\r\nconsiderable eminence and crossing no perceptible water-shed till he\r\ncomes within sight of the waves of the Atlantic. Or if he turns to the\r\nnorth-west he will pass over an undulating country, diversified only by\r\nlow hills, till he dips slowly into the flat and swampy ground which\r\nsurrounds Lake Ngami, itself rather a huge swamp than a lake, and\r\ndescends very gradually from that level to the banks of the Zambesi, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the great Victoria Falls. In fact, this great\r\nplateau is South Africa, and all the rest of the country along the\r\nsea-margin a mere appendage to it. But so large a part of the plateau\r\nis, as we shall see presently, condemned by its dryness to remain\r\nsterile and very thinly peopled, that the interior has not that\r\npreponderating importance which its immense area might seem to give it.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to describe the minor ridges,--though some of\r\nthem, especially in Cape Colony, are abrupt and high enough to be called\r\nMountains,--for none has any great importance as affecting either\r\nmaterial or historical conditions. The longest are those which run\r\nparallel to the dreary and almost uninhabited west coast, and form the\r\nterraces by which the great plateau sinks down to the margin of the\r\nAtlantic. Neither can I touch on the geology, except to observe that a\r\ngreat part of the plateau, especially in the northern part and towards\r\nthe north-east end of the Quathlamba Range, consists of granite or\r\ngneiss, and is believed to be of very great antiquity, _i.e._, to have\r\nstood, as it now stands, high above the level of the sea from a very\r\nremote period of the earth's history. The rocks of the Karroo region are\r\nmore recent. Nowhere in South Africa has any area of modern volcanic\r\naction, much less any active volcano, been discovered. More ancient\r\neruptive rocks, such as greenstones and porphyries, are of frequent\r\noccurrence, and are often spread out in level sheets above the\r\nsedimentary beds of the Karroo and of the Basutoland and Free State\r\nranges.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be noted that the coast has extremely few harbours.\r\nFrom Cape Town eastward and north-eastward there is no sheltered\r\ndeep-water haven till one reaches that of Durban, itself troubled by a\r\nbar, and from Durban to the Zambesi no good ports save Delagoa Bay and\r\nBeira. On the other side of the continent, Saldanha Bay, twenty miles\r\nnorth of Cape Town, is an excellent harbour. After that the Atlantic\r\ncoast shows none for a thousand miles.\r\n\r\nSo much for the surface and configuration of the country. Now let us\r\ncome to the climate, which is a not less important element in making\r\nSouth Africa what it is.\r\n\r\nThe heat is, of course, great, though less great than a traveller from\r\nNorth Africa or India expects to find in such a latitude. Owing to the\r\nvast mass of water in the southern hemisphere, that hemisphere is cooler\r\nin the same latitude than is the northern. Cape Town, in latitude 34°\r\nS., has a colder winter and not so hot a summer as Gibraltar and\r\nAleppo, in latitude 36° N. Still the summer temperature is high even at\r\nDurban, in latitude 30° S., while the northern part of the Transvaal\r\nRepublic, and all the territories of the British South Africa Company,\r\nincluding Matabililand and Mashonaland, lie within the tropic of\r\nCapricorn, that is to say, correspond in latitude to Nubia and the\r\ncentral provinces of India between Bombay and Calcutta.\r\n\r\nThe climate is also, over most of the country, extremely dry. Except in\r\na small district round Cape Town, at the southern extremity of the\r\ncontinent, there is no proper summer and winter, but only a dry season,\r\nthe seven or eight months when the weather is colder, and a wet season,\r\nthe four or five months when the sun is highest. Nor are the rains that\r\nfall in the wet season so copious and continuous as they are in some\r\nother hot countries; in many parts of India, for instance, or in the\r\nWest Indies and Brazil. Thus even in the regions where the rainfall is\r\nheaviest, reaching thirty inches or more in the year, the land soon\r\ndries up and remains parched till the next wet season comes. The air is\r\ntherefore extremely dry, and, being dry, it is clear and stimulating in\r\na high degree.\r\n\r\nNow let us note the influence upon the climate of that physical\r\nstructure we have just been considering. The prevailing wind, and the\r\nwind that brings most of the rain in the wet season, is the east or\r\nsouth-east. It gives a fair supply of moisture to the low coast strip\r\nwhich has been referred to above. Passing farther inland, it impinges\r\nupon the hills which run down from the Quathlamba Range, waters them,\r\nand sometimes falls in snow on the loftiest peaks. A certain part of the\r\nrain-bearing clouds passes still farther inland, and scatters showers\r\nover the eastern part of the tableland, that is to say, over the\r\nTransvaal, the Orange Free State, eastern Bechuanaland, and the\r\nterritories still farther north, toward the Zambesi. Very little\r\nhumidity, however, reaches the tracts farther to the west. The northern\r\npart of Cape Colony as far as the Orange River, the western part of\r\nBechuanaland, and the wide expanse of Damaraland have a quite trifling\r\nrainfall, ranging from four or five to ten inches in the whole year.\r\nUnder the intense heat of the sun this moisture soon vanishes, the\r\nsurface bakes hard, and the vegetation withers. All this region is\r\ntherefore parched and arid, much of it, in fact, a desert, and likely\r\nalways to remain so.\r\n\r\nThese great and dominant physical facts--a low coast belt, a high\r\ninterior plateau, a lofty, rugged mountain-range running nearly parallel\r\nto, and not very far from, the shore of the ocean, whence the rainclouds\r\ncome, a strong sun, a dry climate--have determined the character of\r\nSouth Africa in many ways. They explain the very remarkable fact that\r\nSouth Africa has, broadly speaking, no rivers. Rivers are, indeed,\r\nmarked on the map--rivers of great length and with many tributaries; but\r\nwhen in travelling during the dry season you come to them you find\r\neither a waterless bed or a mere line of green and perhaps unsavoury\r\npools. The streams that run south and east from the mountains to the\r\ncoast are short and rapid torrents after a storm, but at other times\r\ndwindle to feeble trickles of mud. In the interior there are, to be\r\nsure, rivers which, like the Orange River or the Limpopo, have courses\r\nhundreds of miles in length. But they contain so little water during\r\nthree-fourths of the year as to be unserviceable for navigation, while\r\nmost of their tributaries shrink in the dry season to a chain of pools,\r\nscarcely supplying drink to the cattle on their banks. This is one of\r\nthe reasons why the country remained so long unexplored. People could\r\nnot penetrate it by following waterways, as happened both in North and\r\nin South America; they were obliged to travel by ox-waggon, making only\r\nsome twelve or sixteen miles a day, and finding themselves obliged to\r\nhalt, when a good bit of grass was reached, to rest and restore the\r\nstrength of their cattle. For the same reason the country is now forced\r\nto depend entirely upon railways for internal communication. There is\r\nnot a stream (except tidal streams) fit to float anything drawing three\r\nfeet of water.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious experience to travel for hundreds of miles, as one may\r\ndo in the dry season in the north-eastern part of Cape Colony and in\r\nBechuanaland, through a country which is inhabited, and covered in some\r\nplaces with wood, in others with grass or shrublets fit for cattle, and\r\nsee not a drop of running water, and hardly even a stagnant pond. It is\r\nscarcely less strange that such rivers as there are should be useless\r\nfor navigation. But the cause is to be found in the two facts already\r\nstated. In those parts where rain falls it comes at one season, within\r\nthree or four months. Moreover, it comes then in such heavy storms that\r\nfor some hours, or even days, the streams are so swollen as to be not\r\nonly impassable by waggons, but also unnavigable, because, although\r\nthere is plenty of water, the current is too violent. Then when the\r\nfloods have ceased the streams fall so fast, and the channel becomes so\r\nshallow, that hardly even a canoe will float. The other fact arises from\r\nthe proximity to the east coast of the great Quathlamba chain of\r\nmountains. The rivers that flow from it have mostly short courses, while\r\nthe few that come down from behind and break through it, as does the\r\nLimpopo, are interrupted at the place where they break through by rapids\r\nwhich no boat can ascend.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: In particular I will ask the reader to refer to the two\r\nmaps showing the physical features of the country which have been\r\ninserted in this volume.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe physical conditions just described determine the healthfulness of\r\nthe country, and this is a matter of so much moment, especially to those\r\nwho think of settling in South Africa, that I take the earliest\r\nopportunity of referring to it.\r\n\r\nThe sun-heat would make the climate very trying to Europeans, and of\r\ncourse more trying the farther north toward the Equator they live, were\r\nit not for the two redeeming points I have dwelt on--the elevation and\r\nthe dryness of the interior. To be 3000, 4000, or 5000 feet above the\r\nsea is for most purposes the same thing as being in a more temperate\r\nlatitude, and more than five-sixths in area of the districts which are\r\nnow inhabited by Europeans have an elevation of fully 3000 feet. Not\r\nmerely the tablelands of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, but\r\nalso by far the larger part of Cape Colony and nearly the whole of Natal\r\n(excluding a small strip along the coast), attain this elevation. Thus\r\neven in summer, when the heat is great during the day, the coolness of\r\nthe night refreshes the system. The practical test of night temperature\r\nis whether one wishes for a blanket to sleep under. In Madras and Bombay\r\nall the year round, in New York through several months of summer, in\r\nParis or sometimes even in London for a few days in July or August, a\r\nlight blanket is oppressive, and the continuance of the high day\r\ntemperature through the hours of darkness exhausts and enfeebles all but\r\nvigorous constitutions. But in South Africa it is only along the coast,\r\nin places like Durban, Delagoa Bay, or Beira, that one feels inclined to\r\ndispense with a woollen covering at night, while in Johannesburg or\r\nBloemfontein a good thick blanket is none too much even in November,\r\nbefore the cooling rains begin, or in December, when the days are\r\nlongest. In fact, the fall of temperature at sunset is often a source of\r\nrisk to those who, coming straight from Europe, have not yet learned to\r\nguard against sudden changes, for it causes chills which, if they find a\r\nweak organ to pounce upon, may produce serious illness. These rapid\r\nvariations of temperature are not confined to the passage from day to\r\nnight. Sometimes in the midst of a run of the usual warm, brilliant\r\nweather of the dry season there will come a cold, bitter south east\r\nwind, covering the sky with gray clouds and driving the traveller to put\r\non every wrap he possesses. I remember, toward the end of October, such\r\na sudden \"cold snap\" in Matabililand, only twenty degrees from the\r\nequator. One shivered all day long under a thick greatcoat, and the\r\nnatives lit fires in front of their huts and huddled round them for\r\nwarmth. Chills dangerous to delicate people are apt to be produced by\r\nthese changes, and they often turn into feverish attacks, not malarial,\r\nthough liable to be confounded with malarial fevers. This risk of\r\nencountering cold weather is a concomitant of that power of the\r\nsouth-east wind to keep down the great heats, which, on the whole, makes\r\ngreatly for the salubrity of the country; so the gain exceeds the loss.\r\nBut new comers have to be on their guard, and travellers will do well,\r\neven between the tropic and the equator, to provide themselves with warm\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nStrong as the sun is, its direct rays seem to be much less dangerous\r\nthan in India or the eastern United States. Sunstroke is unusual, and\r\none sees few people wearing, even in the tropical north, those hats of\r\nthick double felt or those sun-helmets which are deemed indispensable in\r\nIndia. In fact, Europeans go about with the same head-gear which they\r\nuse in an English summer. But the relation of sun-stroke to climate is\r\nobscure. Why should it be extremely rare in California, when it is very\r\ncommon in New York in the same latitude? Why should it be almost unknown\r\nin the Hawaiian Islands, within seventeen degrees of the equator? Its\r\nrarity in South Africa is a great point in favour of the healthfulness\r\nof the country, and also of the ease and pleasantness of life. In India\r\none has to be always mounting guard against the sun. He is a formidable\r\nand ever-present enemy, and he is the more dangerous the longer you live\r\nin the country. In South Africa it is only because he dries up the soil\r\nso terribly that the traveller wishes to have less of him. The born\r\nAfricander seems to love him.\r\n\r\nThe dryness of the climate makes very strongly for its salubrity. It is\r\nthe absence of moisture no less than the elevation above sea-level that\r\ngives to the air its fresh, keen, bracing quality, the quality which\r\nenables one to support the sun-heat, which keeps the physical frame in\r\nvigour, which helps children to grow up active and healthy, which\r\nconfines to comparatively few districts that deadliest foe of Europeans,\r\nswamp-fever. Malarial fever in one of its many forms, some of them\r\nintermittent, others remittent, is the scourge of the east coast as well\r\nas of the west coast. To find some means of avoiding it would be to\r\ndouble the value of Africa to the European powers which have been\r\nestablishing themselves on the coasts. No one who lives within thirty\r\nmiles of the sea nearly all the way south from Cape Guardafui to\r\nZululand can hope to escape it. It is frequent all round the great\r\nNyanza lakes, and particularly severe in the valley of the Nile from the\r\nlakes downward to Khartoum. It prevails through the comparatively low\r\ncountry which lies along the Congo and the chief tributaries of that\r\ngreat stream. It hangs like a death-cloud over the valley of the\r\nZambesi, and is found up to a height of 3000 or 4000 feet, sometimes\r\neven higher, in Nyassaland and the lower parts of the British\r\nterritories that stretch to Lake Tanganyika. The Administrator of German\r\nEast Africa has lately declared that there is not a square mile of that\r\nvast region that can be deemed free from it. Even along the generally\r\narid shores of Damaraland there are spots where it is to be feared. But\r\nCape Colony and Natal and the Orange Free State are almost exempt from\r\nit. So, too, are all the higher parts of the Transvaal, of Bechuanaland,\r\nof Matabililand, and of Mashonaland. Roughly speaking, one may say that\r\nthe upper boundary line of malarial fevers in these countries is about\r\n4500 feet above the sea, and where fevers occur at a height above 3000\r\nfeet they are seldom of a virulent type. Thus, while the lower parts of\r\nthe Transvaal between the Quathlamba Mountains and the sea are terribly\r\nunhealthy, while the Portuguese country behind Delagoa Bay and Beira as\r\nfar as the foot of the hills is equally dangerous,--Beira itself has the\r\nbenefit of a strong sea-breeze,--by far the larger part of the recently\r\noccupied British territories north and west of the Transvaal is\r\npractically safe. It is, of course, proper to take certain precautions,\r\nto avoid chills and the copious use of alcohol and it is specially\r\nimportant to observe such precautions during and immediately after the\r\nwet season, when the sun is raising vapours from the moist soil, when\r\nnew vegetation has sprung up, and when the long grass which has grown\r\nduring the first rains is rotting under the later rains. Places which\r\nare quite healthful in the dry weather, such as Gaberones and the rest\r\nof the upper valley of the rivers Notwani and Limpopo in eastern\r\nBechuanaland, then become dangerous, because they lie on the banks of\r\nstreams which inundate the lower grounds. Much depends on the local\r\ncircumstances of each spot. To illustrate the differences between one\r\nplace and another, I may take the case of the three chief posts in the\r\nterritories of the British South Africa Company. Buluwayo, nearly 4000\r\nfeet above the sea, is always practically free from malaria, for it\r\nstands in a dry, breezy upland with few trees and short grass. Fort\r\nVictoria, 3670 feet above the sea, is salubrious enough during the dry\r\nseason, but often feverish after the rains, because there is some wet\r\nground near it. Fort Salisbury, 4900 feet above the sea, is now\r\nhealthful at all times, but parts of it used to be feverish at the end\r\nof the rainy season, until they were drained in the beginning of 1895.\r\nSo Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal Republic, is apt to be\r\nmalarious during the months of rain, because (although 4470 feet above\r\nthe sea) it lies in a well-watered hollow; while at Johannesburg, thirty\r\nmiles off, on the top of a high, bare, stony ridge, one has no occasion\r\nto fear fever, though the want of water and proper drainage, as well as\r\nthe quantity of fine dust from the highly comminuted ore and \"tailings\"\r\nwith which the air is filled, had until 1896 given rise to other\r\nmaladies, and especially to septic pneumonia. These will diminish with a\r\nbetter municipal administration, and similarly malaria will doubtless\r\nvanish from the many spots where it is now rife when the swampy grounds\r\nhave been drained and the long grass eaten down by larger herds of\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nIt is apparently the dryness and the purity of the air which have given\r\nSouth Africa its comparative immunity from most forms of chest disease.\r\nMany sufferers from consumption, for whom a speedy death, if they\r\nremained in Europe, had been predicted, recover health, and retain it\r\ntill old age. The spots chiefly recommended are on the high grounds of\r\nthe interior plateau, where the atmosphere is least humid. Ceres,\r\nninety-four miles by rail from Cape Town, and Beaufort West, in the\r\nKarroo, have been resorted to as sanatoria; and Kimberley, the city of\r\ndiamonds, has an equally high reputation for the quality of its air.\r\nHowever, some of the coast districts are scarcely less eligible, though\r\nCape Town has too many rapid changes of weather, and Durban too sultry a\r\nsummer, to make either of them a desirable place of residence for\r\ninvalids.\r\n\r\nApart from all questions of specific complaints, there can be no doubt\r\nas to the general effect of the climate upon health. The aspect of the\r\npeople soon convinces a visitor that, in spite of its heat, the country\r\nis well fitted to maintain in vigour a race drawn from the cooler parts\r\nof Europe. Comparatively few adult Englishmen sprung from fathers\r\nthemselves born in Africa are as yet to be found. But the descendants of\r\nthe Dutch and Huguenot settlers are Africanders up to the sixth or\r\nseventh generation, and the stock shows no sign of losing either its\r\nstature or its physical strength. Athletic sports are pursued as eagerly\r\nas in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWILD ANIMALS AND THEIR FATE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen first explored, South Africa was unusually rich in the kinds both\r\nof plants and of animals which it contained; and until forty or fifty\r\nyears ago the number, size, and beauty of its wild creatures were the\r\nthings by which it was chiefly known to Europeans, who had little\r\nsuspicion of its mineral wealth, and little foreboding of the trouble\r\nthat wealth would cause. Why it was so rich in species is a question on\r\nwhich geology will one day be able to throw light, for much may depend\r\non the relations of land and sea in earlier epochs of the earth's\r\nhistory. Probably the great diversities of elevation and of climate\r\nwhich exist in the southern part of the continent have contributed to\r\nthis profuse variety; and the fact that the country was occupied only by\r\nsavages, who did little or nothing to extinguish any species nature had\r\nplanted, may have caused many weak species to survive when equally weak\r\nones were perishing in Asia and Europe at the hands of more advanced\r\nraces of mankind. The country was therefore the paradise of hunters.\r\nBesides the lion and the leopard, there were many other great cats, some\r\nof remarkable beauty. Besides the elephant, which was in some districts\r\nvery abundant, there existed two kinds of rhinoceros, as well as the\r\nhippopotamus and the giraffe. There was a wonderful profusion of\r\nantelopes,--thirty-one species have been enumerated,--including such\r\nnoble animals as the eland and koodoo, such beautiful ones as the\r\nspringbok and klipspringer, such fierce ones as the blue wildebeest or\r\ngnu. There were two kinds of zebra, a quagga, and a buffalo, both huge\r\nand dangerous. Probably nowhere in the world could so great a variety of\r\nbeautiful animals be seen or a larger variety of formidable ones be\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nAll this has changed, and changed of late years with fatal speed, under\r\nthe increasing range and accuracy of firearms, the increasing\r\naccessibility of the country to the European sportsman, and the\r\nincreasing number of natives who possess guns. The Dutch Boer of eighty\r\nyears ago was a good marksman and loved the chase, but he did not shoot\r\nfor fame and in order to write about his exploits, while the\r\nprofessional hunter who shot to sell ivory or rare specimens had hardly\r\nbegun to exist. The work of destruction has latterly gone on so fast\r\nthat the effect of stating what is still left can hardly be to tempt\r\nothers to join in that work, but may help to show how urgent is the duty\r\nof arresting the process of extermination.\r\n\r\nWhen the first Dutchmen settled at the Cape the lion was so common as to\r\nbe one of the every-day perils of life. Tradition points out a spot in\r\nthe pleasure-ground attached to the Houses of Parliament at Cape Town\r\nwhere a lion was found prowling in what was then the commandant's\r\ngarden. In 1653 it was feared that lions would storm the fort to get at\r\nthe sheep within it, and so late as 1694 they killed nine cows within\r\nsight of the present castle. To-day, however, if the lion is to be found\r\nat all within the limits of Cape Colony, it is only in the wilderness\r\nalong the banks of the Orange River. He was abundant in the Orange Free\r\nState when it became independent in 1854, but has been long extinct\r\nthere. He survives in a few spots in the north of the Transvaal and in\r\nthe wilder parts of Zululand and Bechuanaland, and is not unfrequent in\r\nMatabililand and Mashonaland. One may, however, pass through those\r\ncountries, as I did in October, 1895, without having a chance of seeing\r\nthe beast or even hearing its nocturnal voice, and those who go hunting\r\nthis grandest of all quarries are often disappointed. In the strip of\r\nflat land between the mountains and the Indian Ocean behind Sofala and\r\nBeira, and in the Zambesi valley, there remain lions enough; but the\r\nnumber diminishes so fast that even in that malarious and thinly peopled\r\nland none may be left thirty years hence.\r\n\r\nThe leopard is still to be found all over the country, except where the\r\npopulation is thickest; and as the leopard haunts rocky places, it is,\r\nthough much hunted for the sake of its beautiful skin, less likely to be\r\nexterminated. Some of the smaller carnivora, especially the pretty\r\nlynxes, have now become very rare. There is a good supply of hyenas, but\r\nthey are ugly.\r\n\r\nElephants used to roam in great herds over all the more woody districts,\r\nbut have now been quite driven out of Cape Colony, Natal, and the two\r\nDutch republics, save that in a narrow strip of forest country near the\r\nsouth coast, between Mossel Bay and Algoa Bay, some herds are preserved\r\nby the Cape government. So, too, in the north of the Transvaal there are\r\nstill a few left, also specially preserved. It is only on the east coast\r\nsouth of the Zambesi, and here and there along that river, that the wild\r\nelephant can now be found. From these regions it will soon vanish, and\r\nunless something is done to stop the hunting of elephants the total\r\nextinction of the animal in Africa may be expected within another\r\nhalf-century; for the foolish passion for slaughter which sends\r\nso-called sportsmen on his track, and the high price of ivory, are\r\nlessening its numbers day by day. A similar fate awaits the rhinoceros,\r\nonce common even near the Cape, where he overturned one day the coach of\r\na Dutch governor. The white kind, which is the larger, is now all but\r\nextinct, while the black rhinoceros has become scarce even in the\r\nnorthern regions between the Limpopo and the Zambesi. The hippopotamus,\r\nprotected by his aquatic habits, has fared better, and may still be seen\r\nplunging and splashing in the waters of the Pungwe, the Limpopo, and\r\nother rivers in Portuguese East Africa. But Natal will soon know this\r\ngreat amphibian no more; and within Cape Colony, where the creature was\r\nonce abundant even in the swamps that bordered Table Bay, he is now to\r\nbe found only in the pools along the lower course of the Orange River.\r\nThe crocodile holds his ground better, and is still a serious danger to\r\noxen who go down to drink at the streams. In Zululand and all along the\r\neast coast, as well as in the streams of Mashonaland and Matabililand,\r\nthere is hardly a pool which does not contain some of these formidable\r\nsaurians. Even when the water shrinks in the dry season till little but\r\nmud seems to be left, the crocodile, getting deep into the mud,\r\nmaintains a torpid life till the rains bring him back into activity. Lo\r\nBengula sometimes cast those who had displeased him, bound hand and\r\nfoot, into a river to be devoured by these monsters, which he did not\r\npermit to be destroyed, probably because they were sacred to some\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nThe giraffe has become very scarce, though a herd or two are left in the\r\nsouth of Matabililand, and a larger number in the Kalahari Desert. So,\r\nalso, the zebra and many of the species of antelopes, especially the\r\nlarger kinds, like the eland and the sable, are disappearing, while the\r\nbuffalo is now only to be seen (except in a part of the Colony where a\r\nherd is preserved) in the Portuguese territories along the Zambesi and\r\nthe east coast. The recent cattle-plague has fallen heavily upon him.\r\nSo the ostrich would probably now remain only in the wilds of the\r\nKalahari had not large farms been created in Cape Colony, where young\r\nbroods are reared for the sake of the feathers. On these farms,\r\nespecially near Graham's Town and in the Oudtshorn district, one may see\r\ngreat numbers; nor is there a prettier sight than that of two parent\r\nbirds running along, with a numerous progeny of little ones around them.\r\nThough in a sense domesticated, they are often dangerous, for they kick\r\nforward and claw downward with great violence, and the person whom they\r\nknock down and begin to trample on has little chance of escape with his\r\nlife. Fortunately, it is easy to drive them off with a stick or even an\r\numbrella; and we were warned not to cross an ostrich-farm without some\r\nsuch defence.\r\n\r\nSnakes, though there are many venomous species, seem to be less feared\r\nthan in India or the wilder parts of Australia. The python grows to\r\ntwenty feet or more, but is, of course, not poisonous, and never assails\r\nman unless first molested. The black _momba_, which is nearly as large\r\nas a rattlesnake, is, however, a dangerous creature, being ready to\r\nattack man without provocation, and the bite may prove fatal in less\r\nthan an hour. One sees many skins of this snake in the tropical parts of\r\nSouth Africa, and hears many thrilling tales of combats with them. They\r\nare no longer common in the more settled and temperate regions.\r\n\r\nAlthough even in Cape Colony and the Dutch republics there is still more\r\nfour-footed game to be had than anywhere in Europe, there remain only\r\ntwo regions where large animals can be killed in any considerable\r\nnumbers. One of these is the Portuguese territory between Delagoa Bay\r\nand the Zambesi, together with the adjoining parts of the Transvaal,\r\nwhere the lower spurs of the Quathlamba Range descend to the plain. This\r\ndistrict is very malarious during and after the rains, and most of it\r\nunhealthy at all seasons. The other region is the Kalahari Desert and\r\nthe country north of it between Lake Ngami and the Upper Zambesi. The\r\nKalahari is so waterless as to offer considerable difficulties to\r\nEuropean hunters, and the country round Lake Ngami is swampy and\r\nfeverish. So far the wild creatures have nature in their favour; yet the\r\npassion for killing is in many persons so strong that neither thirst nor\r\nfever deters them, and if the large game are to be saved, it will\r\nclearly be necessary to place them under legal protection. This has been\r\nattempted so far as regards the elephant, rhinoceros, giraffe, and\r\neland. In German East Africa Dr. von Wissmann, the Administrator of that\r\nterritory, has recently (1896) gone further, and ordained restrictions\r\non the slaughter of all the larger animals, except predatory ones. The\r\ngovernments of the two British colonies and the two Boer republics,\r\nwhich have already done well in trying to preserve some of the rarest\r\nand finest beasts, ought to go thoroughly into the question and enact a\r\ncomplete protective code. Still more necessary is it that a similar\r\ncourse should be taken by the British South Africa Company and by the\r\nImperial Government, in whose territories there still survive more of\r\nthe great beasts. It is to be hoped that even the lion and some of the\r\nrare lynxes will ultimately receive consideration. Noxious as they are,\r\nit would be a pity to see them wholly exterminated. When I was in India,\r\nin the year 1888, I was told that there were only seven lions then left\r\nin that vast area, all of them well cared for. The work of slaughter\r\nought to be checked in South Africa before the number gets quite so low\r\nas this, and though there may be difficulties in restraining the natives\r\nfrom killing the big game, it must be remembered that as regards many\r\nanimals it is the European rather than the native, who is the chief\r\nagent of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe predatory creatures which are now most harmful to the farmer are\r\nthe baboons, which infest rocky districts and kill the lambs in such\r\ngreat numbers that the Cape government offers bounties for their\r\nslaughter. But no large animal does mischief for a moment comparable to\r\nthat of the two insect plagues which vex the eastern half of the\r\ncountry, the white ants and the locusts. Of these I shall have something\r\nto say later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nVEGETATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flora of South Africa is extremely rich, showing a number of genera,\r\nand of species which, in proportion to its area, exceeds the number\r\nfound in most other parts of the world. But whether this wealth is due\r\nto the diversity of physical conditions which the country presents, or\r\nrather to geological causes, that is, to the fact that there may at some\r\nremote period have been land connections with other regions which have\r\nfacilitated the immigration of plants from various sides, is a matter on\r\nwhich science cannot yet pronounce, for both the geology and the flora\r\nof the whole African continent have been very imperfectly examined. It\r\nis, however, worth remarking that there are marked affinities between\r\nthe general character of the flora of the south-western corner of South\r\nAfrica and that of the flora of south-western Australia, and similar\r\naffinities between the flora of south-eastern and tropical Africa and\r\nthe flora of India, while the relations to South America are fewer and\r\nmuch less marked. This fact would seem to point to the great antiquity\r\nof the South Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nTo give in such a book as this even the scantiest account of the plants\r\nof South Africa would obviously be impossible. All I propose is to\r\nconvey some slight impression of the part which its vegetation, and\r\nparticularly its trees, play in the landscape and in the economic\r\nconditions of the country. Even this I can do but imperfectly, because,\r\nlike most travellers, I passed through large districts in the dry\r\nseason, when three-fourths of the herbaceous plants are out of flower.\r\n\r\nNo part of the country is richer in beautiful flowers than the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of Cape Town. This extreme south-western corner of Africa\r\nhas a climate of the south temperate zone; that is to say, it has a real\r\nsummer and a real winter, and gets most of its rain in winter, whereas\r\nthe rest of South Africa has only a wet season and a dry season, the\r\nlatter coming in winter. So, too, this corner round Cape Town has a\r\nvegetation characteristically its own, and differing markedly from that\r\nof the arid Karroo regions to the north, and that of the warm\r\nsubtropical regions in the east of the Colony and in Natal. It is here\r\nthat the plants flourish which Europeans and Americans first came to\r\nknow and which are still to them the most familiar examples of the South\r\nAfrican flora. Heaths, for instance, of which there are said to be no\r\nless than three hundred and fifty species in this small district, some\r\nof extraordinary beauty and brilliance, are scarcely found outside of\r\nit. I saw two or three species on the high peaks of Basutoland, and\r\nbelieve some occur as far north as the tropic on the tops of the\r\nQuathlamba Range; but in the lower grounds, and even on the plateau of\r\nthe Karroo they are absent. The general aspect of the vegetation on the\r\nKarroo, and eastward over the plateau into Bechuanaland and the\r\nTransvaal, is to the traveller's eye monotonous--a fact due to the\r\ngeneral uniformity of the geological formations and the general dryness\r\nof the surface. In Natal and in Mashonaland types different from those\r\nof either the Cape or the Karroo appear, and I have never seen a more\r\nbeautiful and varied alpine flora than on a lofty summit of Basutoland\r\nwhich I ascended in early summer. But even in Mashonaland, and in\r\nMatabililand still more, the herbaceous plants make, at least in the\r\ndry season, comparatively little show. I found the number of conspicuous\r\nspecies less than I had expected, and the diversity of types from the\r\ntypes that prevail in the southern part of the plateau (in Bechuanaland\r\nand the Orange Free State) less marked. This is doubtless due to the\r\ngeneral similarity of the conditions that prevail over the plateau.\r\nEverywhere the same hot days and cold nights, everywhere the same\r\ndryness.\r\n\r\nHowever, I must avoid details, especially details which would be\r\ninteresting only to a botanist, and be content with a few words on those\r\nmore conspicuous features of the vegetation which the traveller notes,\r\nand which go to make up his general impression of the country.\r\n\r\nSpeaking broadly, South Africa is a bare country, and this is the more\r\nremarkable because it is a new country, where man has not had time to\r\nwork much destruction. There are ancient forests along the south coast\r\nof Cape Colony and Natal, the best of which are (in the former colony)\r\nnow carefully preserved and administered by a Forest Department of\r\nGovernment. Such is the great Knysna forest, where elephants still roam\r\nwild. But even in these forests few trees exceed fifty or sixty feet in\r\nheight, the tallest being the so-called yellow-wood, and the most useful\r\nthe sneeze-wood. On the slopes of the hills above Graham's Town and King\r\nWilliam's Town one finds (besides real forests here and there) immense\r\nmasses of dense scrub, or \"bush,\" usually from four to eight feet in\r\nheight, sometimes with patches of the prickly-pear, an invader from\r\nAmerica, and a formidable one; for its spines hurt the cattle and make\r\npassage by men a troublesome business. It was this dense, low scrub\r\nwhich constituted the great difficulty of British troops in the fierce\r\nand protracted Kafir wars of fifty years ago; for the ground which the\r\nscrub covers was impassable except by narrow and tortuous paths known\r\nonly to the natives, and it afforded them admirable places for ambush\r\nand for retreat. Nowadays a large part of the bush-covered land is used\r\nfor ostrich-farms, and it is, indeed, fit for little else. The scrub is\r\nmostly dry, while the larger forests are comparatively damp, and often\r\nbeautiful with flowering trees, small tree-ferns, and flexile climbers.\r\nBut the trees are not lofty enough to give any of that dignity which a\r\nEuropean forest, say in England or Germany or Norway, often possesses,\r\nand as the native kinds are mostly evergreens, their leaves have\r\ncomparatively little variety of tint. One of the most graceful is the\r\ncurious silver-tree, so called from the whitish sheen of one side of its\r\nleaves, which grows abundantly on the slopes of Table Mountain, but is\r\nfound hardly anywhere else in the Colony.\r\n\r\nIf this is the character of the woods within reach of the coast rains,\r\nmuch more conspicuous is the want of trees and the poorness of those\r\nscattered here and there on the great interior plateau. In the desert\r\nregion, that is to say, the Karroo, the northern part of Cape Colony to\r\nthe Orange River, western Bechuanaland, and the German territories of\r\nNamaqualand and Damaraland, there are hardly any trees, except small,\r\nthorny mimosas (they are really acacias, the commonest being _Acacia\r\nhorrida_), whose scanty, light-green foliage casts little shade. On the\r\nhigher mountains, where there is a little more moisture, a few other\r\nshrubs or small trees may be found, and sometimes beside a watercourse,\r\nwhere a stream runs during the rains, the eye is refreshed by a few\r\nslender willows; but speaking generally, this huge desert, one-third of\r\nSouth Africa, contains nothing but low bushes, few of which are fit even\r\nfor fuel. Farther east, where the rainfall is heavier, the trees, though\r\nstill small, are more frequent and less thorny. Parts of the great plain\r\nround Kimberley were tolerably well wooded thirty years ago, but the\r\ntrees have all been cut down to make mine props or for fire-wood. North\r\nof Mafeking the rolling flats and low hills of Bechuanaland are pretty\r\nfairly wooded, and so to a less degree are the adjoining parts of the\r\nTransvaal and Matabililand. The road going north from Mafeking passes\r\nthrough some three hundred miles of such woodlands, but a less beautiful\r\nor interesting woodland I have never seen. The trees are mostly the\r\nthorny mimosas I have mentioned. None exceed thirty, few reach\r\ntwenty-five, feet. Though they grow loosely scattered, the space between\r\nthem is either bare or occupied by low and very prickly bushes. The\r\nground is parched, and one can get no shade, except by standing close\r\nunder a trunk somewhat thicker than its neighbours. Still farther north\r\nthe timber is hardly larger, though the general aspect of the woods is\r\nimproved by the more frequent occurrence of flowering trees, some\r\nsweet-scented, with glossy leaves and small white flowers, some with\r\ngorgeous clusters of blossoms. Three are particularly handsome. One,\r\nusually called the Kafir-boom, has large flowers of a brilliant crimson.\r\nAnother (_Lonchocarpus speciosus_[4]), for which no English name seems\r\nto exist, shows lovely pendulous flowers of a bluish lilac, resembling\r\nin colour those of the _wistaria_. The third is an arboraceous St.\r\nJohn's wort (_Hypericum Schimperi_[4]), which I found growing in a\r\nvalley of Manicaland, at a height of nearly 4000 feet above the sea. All\r\nthree would be great ornaments to a south European shrubbery could they\r\nbe induced to bear the climate, which, in the case of the two latter\r\n(for I hardly think the Kafir-boom would suit a colder air), seems not\r\nimpossible. In Manicaland, among the mountains which form the eastern\r\nedge of the plateau, the trees are taller, handsomer, and more tropical\r\nin their character, and palms, though of no great height, are sometimes\r\nseen. But not even in the most humid of the valleys and on the lower\r\nspurs of the range, where it sinks into the coast plain, nor along the\r\nswampy banks of the Pungwe River, did I see any tree more than sixty\r\nfeet high, and few more than thirty. Neither was there any of that\r\nluxuriant undergrowth which makes some tropical forests, like those at\r\nthe foot of the Nilghiri Hills in India or in some of the isles of the\r\nPacific, so impressive as evidences of the power and ceaseless activity\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nThe poverty of the woods in Bechuanaland and Matabililand seems to be\r\ndue not merely to the dryness of the soil and to the thin and sandy\r\ncharacter which so often marks it, but also to the constant grass-fires.\r\nThe grass is generally short, so that these fires do not kill the trees;\r\nnor does one hear of such great forest conflagrations as are frequent\r\nand ruinous in Western America and by no means unknown in the south of\r\nCape Colony. But these fires doubtless injure the younger trees\r\nsufficiently to stunt their growth, and this mischief is, of course, all\r\nthe greater when an exceptionally dry year occurs. In such years the\r\ngrass-fires, then most frequent, may destroy the promise of the wood\r\nover a vast area.\r\n\r\nThe want of forests in South Africa is one of the greatest misfortunes\r\nof the country, for it makes timber costly; it helps to reduce the\r\nrainfall, and it aggravates the tendency of the rain, when it comes, to\r\nrun off rapidly in a sudden freshet. Forests have a powerful influence\r\nupon climate in holding moisture,[5] and not only moisture, but soil\r\nalso. In South Africa the violent rain-storms sweep away the surface of\r\nthe ground, and prevent the deposition of vegetable mould. Nothing\r\nretains that mould or the soil formed by decomposed rock as well as a\r\ncovering of wood and the herbage which the neighbourhood of\r\ncomparatively moist woodlands helps to support. It is much to be desired\r\nthat in all parts of the country where trees will grow trees should be\r\nplanted, and that those which remain should be protected. Unfortunately,\r\nmost of the South African trees grow slowly, so where planting has been\r\nattempted it is chiefly foreign sorts that are tried. Among these the\r\nfirst place belongs to the Australian gums, because they shoot up faster\r\nthan any others. One finds them now everywhere, mostly in rows or groups\r\nround a house or a hamlet, but sometimes also in regular plantations.\r\nThey have become a conspicuous feature in the landscape of the veldt\r\nplateau, especially in those places where there was no wood, or the\r\nlittle that existed has been destroyed. Kimberley, for instance, and\r\nPretoria are beginning to be embowered in groves of eucalyptus; Buluwayo\r\nis following suit; and all over Matabililand and Mashonaland one\r\ndiscovers in the distance the site of a farm-steading or a store by the\r\nwaving tops of the gum-trees. If this goes on these Australian\r\nimmigrants will sensibly affect the aspect of the country, just as\r\nalready they have affected that of the Riviera in south-eastern France,\r\nof the Campagna of Rome, of the rolling tops of the Nilghiri Hills in\r\nSouthern India, from which, unhappily, the far more beautiful ancient\r\ngroves (\"sholas\") have now almost disappeared. Besides those gums,\r\nanother Australasian tree, the thin-foliaged and unlovely, but\r\nquick-growing \"beefwood,\" has been largely planted at Kimberley and some\r\nother places. The stone-pine of Southern Europe, the cluster-pine\r\n(_Pinus Pinaster_), and the Aleppo or Jerusalem pine (_Pinus\r\nHalepensis_), have all been introduced and seem to do well. The\r\nAustralian wattles have been found very useful in helping to fix the\r\nsoil on sandy flats, such as those near Cape Town, and the bark of one\r\nspecies is an important article of commerce in Natal, where (near\r\nMaritzburg, for instance) it grows profusely. But of all the immigrant\r\ntrees none is so beautiful as the oak. The Dutch began to plant it round\r\nCape Town early in the eighteenth century, and it is now one of the\r\nelements which most contribute to the charm of the scenery in this\r\neminently picturesque south-west corner of the country. Nothing can be\r\nmore charming than the long oak avenues which line the streets of\r\nStellenbosch, for instance; and they help, with the old-fashioned Dutch\r\nhouses of that quaint little town, to give a sort of Hobbema flavour to\r\nthe foregrounds.\r\n\r\nThe changes which man has produced in the aspect of countries, by the\r\ntrees he plants and the crops he sows, are a curious subject for inquiry\r\nto the geographer and the historian. These changes sometimes take place\r\nvery rapidly. In the Hawaiian Islands, for instance, discovered by\r\nCaptain Cook little more than a century ago, many of the shrubs which\r\nmost abound and give its tone to the landscape have come (and that\r\nmostly not by planting, but spontaneously) from the shores of Asia and\r\nAmerica within the last eighty years. In Egypt most of the trees which\r\nfill the eye in the drive from Cairo to the pyramids were introduced by\r\nMehemet Ali, so that the banks of the Nile, as we see them, are\r\ndifferent not only from those which Herodotus saw, but even from those\r\nwhich Napoleon saw. In North Africa the Central American prickly-pear\r\nand the Australian gum make the landscape quite different from that of\r\nCarthaginian or even of Roman times. So South Africa is\r\nchanging--changing all the more because many of the immigrant trees\r\nthrive better than the indigenous ones, and are fit for spots where the\r\nlatter make but little progress; and in another century the country may\r\nwear an aspect quite unlike that which it now presents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: I owe these names to the kindness of the authorities at the\r\nRoyal Gardens at Kew, who have been good enough to look through\r\nfifty-four dried specimens which I collected and preserved as well as I\r\ncould while travelling through Mashonaland and Basutoland. Eleven of\r\nthese fifty-four were pronounced to be species new to science, a fact\r\nwhich shows how much remains to be done in the way of botanical\r\nexploration.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: It has been plausibly suggested that one reason why many\r\nEnglish rivers which were navigable in the tenth century (because we\r\nknow that the Northmen traversed them in vessels which had crossed the\r\nGerman Ocean) but are now too shallow to let a row-boat pass, is to be\r\nfound in the destruction of the forests and the draining of the marshes\r\nwhich the forests sheltered.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THE VARIOUS POLITICAL DIVISIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto I have spoken of South Africa as a natural whole, ignoring its\r\nartificial division into Colonies and States. It may be well to complete\r\nthe account of the physical characteristics of the country by giving the\r\nreader some notion of the aspects of each of the political divisions,\r\nand thereby a notion also of their relative importance and resources as\r\nwealth-producing regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPE COLONY\r\n\r\nCape Colony is a huge territory more than twice as large as the United\r\nKingdom. But very little of it is available for tillage, and much of it\r\nis too arid even for stock-keeping. The population, including natives,\r\nis only seven to the square mile. Nearly the whole of it is high\r\ncountry. All along its westerly coast and its southerly coast there is a\r\nstrip of low ground bordering the ocean, which in some places is but a\r\nmile or two wide, and in others, where a broad valley opens spreads\r\nbackward, giving thirty or forty square miles of tolerably level or\r\nundulating ground. The rich wine and corn district round Stellenbosch\r\nand Paarl and northward towards Malmesbury is such a tract. Behind this\r\nlow strip the country rises, sometimes in steep acclivities, up which a\r\nroad or railway has to be carried in curves and zigzags, sometimes in\r\nsuccessive terraces, the steps, so to speak, by which the lofty interior\r\nbreaks down towards the sea.\r\n\r\nBehind these terraces and slopes lies the great tableland described in a\r\npreceding chapter. Though I call it a tableland, it is by no means flat,\r\nfor several long, though not lofty, ranges of hills, mostly running east\r\nand west, intersect it. Some tracts are only 2000 feet, others as much\r\nas 5000 feet, above the sea, while the highest hilltops approach 8000\r\nfeet. The part of this high country which lies between longitude 20° and\r\n25° E., with the Nieuweld and Sneeuwberg mountains to the north of it,\r\nand the Zwarte Berg to the south, is called the Great Karroo. (The word\r\nis Hottentot, and means a dry or bare place.) It is tolerably level,\r\nexcessively dry, with no such thing as a running stream over its huge\r\nexpanse of three hundred miles long and half as much wide, nor, indeed,\r\nany moisture, save in a few places shallow pools which almost disappear\r\nin the dry season. The rainfall ranges from five to fifteen inches in\r\nthe year. It is therefore virtually a desert, bearing no herbage (except\r\nfor a week or two after a rainstorm), and no trees, though there are\r\nplenty of prickly shrubs and small bushes, some of these succulent\r\nenough, when they sprout after the few showers that fall in the summer,\r\nto give good browsing to sheep and goats. The brilliancy of the air, the\r\nwarmth of the days, and the coldness of the nights remind one who\r\ntraverses the Karroo of the deserts of Western America between the Rocky\r\nMountains and the Sierra Nevada, though the soil is much less alkaline,\r\nand the so-called \"sage-brush\" plants characteristic of an alkaline\r\ndistrict are mostly absent. To the north of the Karroo and of the\r\nmountains which bound it, a similar district, equally arid, dreary, and\r\nbarren, stretches away to the banks of the Orange River, which here in\r\nits lower course has less water than in its upper course, because, like\r\nthe Nile, it receives no affluents and is wasted by the terrible sun. In\r\nfact, one may say that from the mountains dividing the southern part of\r\nthe Karroo from the coast lands all the way north to the Orange River, a\r\ndistance of nearly four hundred miles, nature has made the country a\r\ndesert of clay and stone (seldom of sand), though man has here and there\r\ntried to redeem it for habitation.\r\n\r\nThe north-eastern part of the interior of Cape Colony is more generally\r\nelevated than the south-western. From Graaf-Reinet northward to\r\nKimberley and Mafeking, and north-eastward to the borders of Basutoland,\r\nthe country is 4000 feet or more above sea-level; much of it is nearly\r\nlevel, and almost all of it bare of wood. It is better watered than the\r\nwestern districts, enjoying a rainfall of from ten to twenty-five inches\r\nin the year, and is therefore mostly covered with grass after the rains,\r\nand not merely with dry thorny bushes. Nevertheless, its general aspect\r\nin the dry season is so parched and bare that the stranger is surprised\r\nto be told that it supports great quantities of cattle, sheep, and\r\ngoats. The south-eastern part, including the Quathlamba Range, and the\r\nhilly country descending from that range to the sea, has a still heavier\r\nrainfall and is in some places covered with forest. Here the grass is\r\nricher, and in the valleys there is plenty of land fit for tillage\r\nwithout irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLONY OF NATAL\r\n\r\nMuch smaller, but more favoured by nature, is the British colony of\r\nNatal, which adjoins the easternmost part of Cape Colony, and now\r\nincludes the territories of Zululand and Tonga land. Natal proper and\r\nZululand resemble in their physical conditions the south-eastern corner\r\nof Cape Colony. Both lie entirely on the sea slope of the Quathlamba\r\nRange, and are covered by mountains and hills descending from that\r\nrange. Both are hilly or undulating, with a charming variety of surface;\r\nand they are also comparatively well watered, with a perennial stream in\r\nevery valley. Hence there is plenty of grass, and towards the coast\r\nplenty of wood also, while the loftier interior is bare. The climate is\r\nmuch warmer than that of Cape Colony, and in the narrow strip which\r\nborders the sea becomes almost tropical. Nor is this heat attributable\r\nentirely to the latitude. It is largely due to the great Mozambique\r\ncurrent, which brings down from the tropical parts of the Indian Ocean a\r\nvast body of warm water which heats the adjoining coast just as the Gulf\r\nStream heats the shores of Georgia and the Carolinas; and the effect of\r\nthis mass of hot water upon the air over it would doubtless be felt much\r\nmore in Natal were it not for the rapid rise of the ground from the sea\r\nin that colony. Pietermaritzburg, the capital, is only some fifty miles\r\nfrom the coast as the crow flies. But though it lies in a valley, it is\r\n2225 feet above sea-level, and from it the country steadily rises\r\ninland, till at Laing's Nek (the watershed between the Indian Ocean and\r\nthe Atlantic), the height of 5300 feet is reached, and the winter cold\r\nis severe. Nearly the whole of Natal and four-fifths of Zululand may\r\nthus be deemed a temperate country, where Europeans can thrive and\r\nmultiply. So far as soil goes it is one of the richest as well as one of\r\nthe fairest parts of South Africa. Tongaland, a smaller district, lies\r\nlower and is less healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN SOUTH-WEST AFRICA\r\n\r\nVery different is the vast German territory (322,000 square miles) which\r\nstretches northward from Cape Colony, bounded on the south by the Orange\r\nRiver, on the north by the West African territories of Portugal, on the\r\neast by Bechuanaland. Great Namaqualand and Damaraland constitute an\r\nenormous wilderness, very thinly peopled, because the means of life are\r\nvery scanty. This wilderness is, except the narrow and sandy coast\r\nstrip, a high country (3000 to 4500 feet above sea-level) and a dry\r\ncountry, drier even than the Karroo, and far too dry for any kind of\r\ncultivation. Some parts, especially those in the south-west, are\r\nhopelessly parched and barren; others have small bushes or grass; while\r\non the higher grounds and generally in the far northern parts, where the\r\nOvampo tribe dwell, grass is abundant, and as cattle can thrive there is\r\nalso population. Copper has been discovered in considerable quantities,\r\nand other minerals (including coal) are believed to exist. But the\r\ncountry, taken all in all, and excepting the little explored districts\r\nof the north-east, toward the Upper Zambesi,--districts whose resources\r\nare still very imperfectly known,--is a dreary and desolate region,\r\nwhich seems likely to prove of little value. Germany now owns the whole\r\nof it, save the port of Walfish Bay, which has been retained for and is\r\nadministered by Cape Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTUGUESE SOUTH-EAST AFRICA\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the continent Portugal holds the country which\r\nlies along the Indian Ocean from British Tongaland northward to the\r\nZambesi. Close to the sea it is level, rising gently westward in hills,\r\nand in some places extending to the crest of the Quathlamba Mountains.\r\nThus it has considerable variety of aspect and climate, and as the rain\r\nfalls chiefly on the slopes of the mountains, the interior is generally\r\nbetter watered than the flat seaboard, which is often sandy and\r\nworthless. Much of this region is of great fertility, capable of\r\nproducing all the fruits of the tropics. But much of it, including some\r\nof the most fertile parts, is also very malarious, while the heat is far\r\ntoo great for European labour. When plantations are established\r\nthroughout it, as they have been in a few--but only a few--spots by the\r\nPortuguese, it will be by natives that they will be cultivated. The\r\nKafir population is now comparatively small, but this may be due rather\r\nto the desolating native wars than to the conditions of the soil.\r\n\r\nSo much for the four maritime countries. There remain the two Dutch\r\nrepublics and the British territories which have not yet been formed\r\ninto colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORANGE FREE STATE\r\n\r\nThe Orange Free State (48,000 square miles) lies entirely on the great\r\nplateau, between 4000 and 5000 feet above sea-level. It is in the main a\r\nlevel country, though hills are scattered over it, sometimes reaching a\r\nheight of nearly 6000 feet. A remarkable feature of most of these hills,\r\nas of many all over the plateau, is that they are flat-topped, and have\r\noften steep, even craggy escarpments. This seems due to the fact that\r\nthe strata (chiefly sandstone) are horizontal; and very often a bed of\r\nhard igneous rock, some, kind of trap or greenstone, or porphyry,\r\nprotects the summit of the hill from the disintegrating influences of\r\nthe weather. It is a bare land, with very little wood, and that small\r\nand scrubby, but is well covered with herbage, affording excellent\r\npasture during two-thirds of the year. After the first rains, when these\r\nwide stretches of gently undulating land are dressed in their new\r\nvesture of brilliant green, nothing can be imagined more exhilarating\r\nthan a ride across the wide expanse; for the air is pure, keen, and\r\nbracing, much like that of the high prairies of Colorado or Wyoming.\r\nThere are fortunately no blizzards, but violent thunderstorms are not\r\nuncommon, and the hailstones--I have seen them as big as bantams'\r\neggs--which fall during such storms sometimes kill the smaller animals,\r\nand even men. Dry as the land appears to the eye during the winter, the\r\nlarger streams do not wholly fail, and water can generally be got. The\r\nsouth-eastern part of the Free State, especially along the Caledon\r\nRiver, is extremely fertile, one of the best corn-growing parts of\r\nAfrica. The rest is fitter for pasture than for tillage, except, of\r\ncourse, on the alluvial banks of the rivers, and nearly the whole region\r\nis in fact occupied by huge grazing farms. As such a farm needs and\r\nsupports only a few men, the population grows but slowly. The Free State\r\nis nearly as big as England and just as big as the State of New York;\r\nbut it has only 77,000 white inhabitants and about 130,000 natives.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC\r\n\r\nSomewhat larger,--about as large as Great Britain and nearly two-thirds\r\nthe size of France--is the South African Republic, which we commonly\r\ntalk of as the Transvaal. Of its white population, which numbers some\r\n170,000, two-thirds are in the small mining district of the\r\nWitwatersrand. All the Transvaal, except a strip on the eastern and\r\nanother strip on the northern border along the river Limpopo, also\r\nbelongs to the great plateau and exhibits the characteristic features of\r\nthe plateau. The hills are, however, higher than in the Free State, and\r\nalong the east, where the Quathlamba Range forms the outer edge of the\r\nplateau, they deserve to be called mountains, for some of them reach\r\n7000 feet. These high regions are healthy, for the summer heats are\r\ntempered by easterly breezes and copious summer rains. The lower parts\r\nlying toward the Indian Ocean and the Limpopo River are feverish, though\r\ndrainage and cultivation may be expected to reduce the malaria and\r\nimprove the conditions of health. Like the Free State, the Transvaal is\r\nprimarily a pasture land, but in many parts the herbage is less juicy\r\nand wholesome than in the smaller republic, and belongs to what the\r\nDutch Boers call \"sour veldt.\" There are trees in the more sheltered\r\nparts, but except in the lower valleys, they are small, and of no\r\neconomic value. The winter cold is severe, and the fierce sun dries up\r\nthe soil, and makes the grass sear and brown for the greater part of the\r\nyear. Strong winds sweep over the vast stretches of open upland, checked\r\nby no belts of forest. It is a country whose aspect has little to\r\nattract the settler. No one would think it worth fighting for so far as\r\nthe surface goes; and until sixteen years ago nobody knew that there was\r\nenormous wealth lying below the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH TERRITORIES--BECHUANALAND\r\n\r\nOf one British territory outside the two colonies, viz., Basutoland, I\r\nshall have to speak fully hereafter. A second, Bechuanaland, including\r\nthe Kalahari Desert, is of vast extent, but slender value. It is a level\r\nland lying entirely on the plateau between 3,000 and 4000 feet above the\r\nsea, and while some of its streamlets drain into the Limpopo, and so to\r\nthe Indian Ocean, others flow westward and northward into marshes and\r\nshallow lakes, in which they disappear. One or two, however, succeed, in\r\nwet seasons, in getting as far as the Orange River, and find through it\r\nan outlet to the sea. It is only in the wet season that the streamlets\r\nflow, for Bechuanaland is intensely dry. I travelled four hundred miles\r\nthrough it without once crossing running water, though here and there in\r\ntraversing the dry bed of a brook one was told that there was water\r\nunderneath, deep in the sand. Notwithstanding this superficial aridity,\r\neastern Bechuanaland is deemed one of the best ranching tracts in South\r\nAfrica, for the grass is sweet, and the water can usually be obtained by\r\ndigging, though it is often brackish. There is also plenty of wood--thin\r\nand thorny, but sufficiently abundant to diversify the aspect of what\r\nwould otherwise be a most dreary and monotonous region.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TERRITORIES OF THE BRITISH SOUTH AFRICA COMPANY\r\n\r\nNorth of Bechuanaland and the Transvaal, and stretching all the way to\r\nthe Zambesi, are those immense territories which have been assigned to\r\nthe British South Africa Company as the sphere of its operations, and to\r\nwhich the name of Rhodesia has been given. Matabililand and Mashonaland,\r\nthe only parts that have been at all settled, are higher, more\r\nundulating, and altogether more attractive than Bechuanaland, with great\r\nswelling downs somewhat resembling the Steppes of Southern Russia or the\r\nprairies of Kansas. Except in the east and south-east, the land is\r\nundulating rather than hilly, but in the south-west, towards the Upper\r\nLimpopo, there lies a high region, full of small rocky heights often\r\nclothed with thick bush--a country difficult to traverse, as has been\r\nfound during the recent native outbreak; for it was there that most of\r\nthe Kafirs took shelter and were found difficult to dislodge. Towards\r\nthe south-east, along the middle course of the Limpopo, the country is\r\nlower and less healthy. On the northern side of the central highlands,\r\nthe ground sinks towards the Zambesi, and the soil, which among the\r\nhills is thin or sandy, becomes deeper. In that part and along the river\r\nbanks there are great possibilities of agricultural development, while\r\nthe uplands, where the subjacent rock is granite or gneiss, with\r\noccasional beds of slate or schist, are generally barer and more dry,\r\nfit rather for pasture than for tillage. More rain falls than in\r\nBechuanaland, so it is only at the end of the dry season, in October,\r\nthat the grass begins to fail on the pastures. The climate, though very\r\nwarm,--for here we are well within the tropics,--is pleasant and\r\ninvigorating, for nowhere do brighter and fresher breezes blow, and the\r\nheat of the afternoons is forgotten in the cool evenings. It is\r\nhealthy, too, except along the swampy river banks and where one descends\r\nto the levels of the Zambesi, or into the Limpopo Valley.\r\n\r\nThe reader will have gathered from this general sketch that there are no\r\nnatural boundaries severing from one another the various political\r\ndivisions of South Africa. The north-eastern part of Cape Colony is\r\nsubstantially the same kind of country as the Orange Free State and\r\nEastern Bechuanaland; the Transvaal, or at least three-fourths of its\r\narea, is physically similar to the Free State; the boundary between Cape\r\nColony and Natal is an artificial one; while Matabililand and\r\nMashonaland present features resembling those of the Northern Transvaal,\r\ndiffering only in being rather hotter and rather better watered. So far\r\nas nature is concerned, the conditions she prescribes for the life of\r\nman, the resources she opens to his energies, are very similar over\r\nthese wide areas, save, of course, that some parts are much richer than\r\nothers in mineral deposits. It is only along the frontier line which\r\ndivides Natal and the Portuguese dominions from the Transvaal and the\r\nterritories of the British South Africa Company that a political\r\ncoincides with a physical line of demarcation. Even German South-west\r\nAfrica differs scarcely at all from the Kalahari Desert, which adjoins\r\nit and which forms the western part of Bechuanaland, and differs little\r\nalso from the north-western regions of Cape Colony. If the reader will\r\ncompare the two physical maps contained in this volume with the map\r\nwhich shows the political divisions of the country he will notice that\r\nthese political divisions do not correspond with the areas where more or\r\nless rain falls, or where the ground is more or less raised above the\r\nsea or traversed by mountain chains. The only exception is to be found\r\nin the fact that the boundary of Natal towards Basutoland and the Orange\r\nFree State has been drawn along the watershed between the Indian Ocean\r\nand the Atlantic, and that the boundary line between the Portuguese\r\nterritories and those of the Transvaal Republic and of the British South\r\nAfrica Company, is in many places the line of division between the\r\nmountains and the low country. The Orange River and the Limpopo have, in\r\nparts of their courses, been taken as convenient political frontiers.\r\nBut rivers, though convenient for this purpose to the statesman and the\r\ngeographer, are not natural boundaries in the true sense of the term.\r\nAnd thus we may say that the causes which have cut up South Africa into\r\nits present Colonies and States have been (except as aforesaid)\r\nhistorical causes, rather than differences due to the hand of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nNATURE AND HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that some general idea of how nature has shaped and moulded South\r\nAfrica has been conveyed to the reader, a few pages may be devoted to\r\nconsidering what influence on the fortunes of the country and its\r\ninhabitants has been exerted by its physical character. The history of\r\nevery country may be regarded as the joint result of three factors--the\r\nnatural conditions of the country itself, the qualities of the races\r\nthat have occupied it, and the circumstances under which their\r\noccupation took place. And among savage or barbarous people natural\r\nconditions have an even greater importance than they have in more\r\nadvanced periods of civilisation, because they are more powerful as\r\nagainst man. Man in his savage state is not yet able to resist such\r\nconditions or to turn them to serve his purposes, but is condemned to\r\nsubmit to the kind of life which they prescribe.\r\n\r\nThis was the case with the first inhabitants of South Africa. They seem\r\nto have entered it as savages, and savages they remained. Nature was\r\nstrong and stern; she spread before them no such rich alluvial plains as\r\ntempted cultivation in the valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates.\r\nIntellectually feeble, and without the patience or the foresight to\r\nattempt to till the soil in a land where droughts are frequent and\r\ndisastrous, the Bushmen were content with killing game, and the\r\nHottentots with living on the milk of their cattle. Such a life, which\r\nwas one of uncertainty and often of hardship, permitted no accumulation\r\nof wealth, gave no leisure, suggested no higher want than that of food,\r\nand was in all respects unfavourable to material progress. Even the\r\nBantu people, who probably came later and were certainly more advanced,\r\nfor they carried on some little cultivation of the soil, remained at a\r\nlow level. Nature gave them, except in dry years, as much corn as they\r\nneeded in return for very little labour. Clothing they did not need, and\r\ntheir isolation from the rest of the world left them ignorant of\r\nluxuries. When the European voyagers found them at the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, they were making little or no advance in the arts of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nUpon the growth of European settlements the influence of the physical\r\nstructure of the country has been very marked. When the Portuguese had\r\nfollowed the long line of coast from the mouth of the Orange River to\r\nthat of the Zambesi, and from the mouth of the Zambesi northward to\r\nZanzibar, they settled only where they heard that gold and ivory could\r\nbe obtained. Their forts and trading stations, the first of which dates\r\nfrom 1505, were therefore planted on the coast northward from the\r\nLimpopo River. Sofala, a little south of the modern port of Beira, was\r\nthe principal one. Here they traded, and twice or thrice they made,\r\nalways in search of the gold-producing regions, expeditions inland.\r\nThese expeditions, however, had to traverse the flat and malarious strip\r\nof ground which lies along the Indian Ocean. A large part of the white\r\ntroops died, and the rest arrived at the higher ground so much weakened\r\nthat they could achieve no permanent conquests, for they were opposed by\r\nwarlike tribes. In the course of years a small population speaking\r\nPortuguese, though mixed with native blood, grew up along the coast. The\r\nclimate, however, destroyed what vigour the whites had brought from\r\nEurope, and by degrees they ceased to even attempt to conquer or occupy\r\nthe interior. The heat and the rains, together with fever, the offspring\r\nof heat and rains, checked further progress. Three centuries passed,\r\nduring which the knowledge of south-eastern Africa which the civilised\r\nworld had obtained within the twenty years that followed the voyages of\r\nVasco da Gama, was scarcely increased.\r\n\r\nDuring those three centuries, America, which had not been discovered\r\ntill six years after Bartholomew Diaz passed the Cape of Good Hope, had\r\nbeen, all except a part of the north-west, pretty thoroughly explored\r\nand partitioned out among five European powers. Large and prosperous\r\ncolonies had sprung up and before the end of the eighteenth century one\r\ngreat independent state had established itself. The discovery of\r\nAustralia and New Zealand came much later than that of America; but\r\nwithin one century from the first European settlement in Australia (A.D.\r\n1787) the whole continent, though its interior is uninviting, had been\r\ntraversed along many lines, and five prosperous European colonies had\r\ngrown to importance. The slow progress of exploration and settlement in\r\nSouth Africa during so long a period is therefore a noteworthy\r\nphenomenon which deserves a few observations.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Portuguese part of the East African coast, the\r\nexplanation just given is sufficient. As regards that part of the West\r\ncoast which lies south of the Portuguese colony of Angola, the natural\r\nfeatures of the country make no explanation needed. No more arid or\r\nbarren coast is to be found anywhere, and in its whole long stretch\r\nthere is but one tolerable port, that of Walfish Bay. The inland region\r\nis scarcely better. Much of it is waterless and without herbage. No gold\r\nnor ivory nor other article of value was obtainable. Accordingly, nobody\r\ncared to settle or explore, and the land would probably be still lying\r\nunclaimed had not the settlement of Herr Lüderitz and a vague desire\r\nfor territorial expansion prompted Germany to occupy it in 1884.\r\n\r\nThe south coast, from the Cape to the Tugela River, was much more\r\nattractive. Here the climate was salubrious, the land in many places\r\nfertile, and everywhere fit for sheep or cattle. Here, accordingly, a\r\nsmall European community, first founded in 1652, grew up and spread\r\nslowly eastward and northward along the shore during the century and a\r\nhalf from its first establishment. The Dutch settlers did not care to\r\npenetrate the interior, because the interior seemed to offer little to a\r\nfarmer. Behind the well-watered coast belt lay successive lines of steep\r\nmountains, and behind those mountains the desert waste of the Karroo,\r\nwhere it takes six acres to keep a sheep. Accordingly, it was only a few\r\nbold hunters, a few farmers on the outskirts of the little maritime\r\ncolony, and a few missionaries, who cared to enter this wide wilderness.\r\n\r\nWhen exploration began, it began from this south-west corner of Africa.\r\nIt began late. In 1806, when the British took the Cape from the Dutch,\r\nfew indeed were the white men who had penetrated more than one hundred\r\nmiles from the coast, and the farther interior was known only by report.\r\nFor thirty years more progress was slow; and it is within our own time\r\nthat nearly all the exploration, and the settlement which has followed\r\nquickly on the heels of exploration, has taken place. Just sixty years\r\nago the Dutch Boers passed in their heavy waggons from Cape Colony to\r\nthe spots where Bloemfontein and Pretoria now stand. In 1854-56 David\r\nLivingstone made his way through Bechuanaland to the falls of the\r\nZambesi and the west coast at St. Paul de Loanda. In 1889 the vast\r\nterritories between the Transvaal Republic and the Zambesi began to be\r\noccupied by the Mashonaland pioneers. All these explorers, all the\r\nfarmers, missionaries, hunters, and mining prospectors, came up into\r\nSouth Central Africa from the south-west extremity of the continent\r\nover the great plateau. They moved north-eastward, because there was\r\nmore rain, and therefore more grass and game in that direction than\r\ntoward the north. They were checked from time to time by the warlike\r\nnative tribes; but they were drawn on by finding everywhere a country in\r\nwhich Europeans could live and thrive. It was the existence of this high\r\nand cool plateau that permitted their discoveries and encouraged their\r\nsettlement. And thus the rich interior has come to belong, not to the\r\nPortuguese, who first laid hold of South Africa, but to the races who\r\nfirst entered the plateau at the point where it is nearest the sea, the\r\nDutch and the English. Coming a thousand miles by land, they have seized\r\nand colonised the country that lies within sixty or eighty miles of the\r\nocean behind the Portuguese settlements, because they had good healthy\r\nair to breathe during all those thousand miles of journey; while the\r\nPortuguese, sunk among tropical swamps, were doing no more than maintain\r\ntheir hold upon the coast, and were allowing even the few forts they had\r\nestablished along the lower course of the Zambesi to crumble away.\r\n\r\nThe same natural conditions, however, which have made the plateau\r\nhealthy, have kept it sparsely peopled. Much of this high interior,\r\nwhose settlement has occupied the last sixty years, is a desert unfit,\r\nand likely to be always unfit, for human habitation. Even in those parts\r\nwhich are comparatively well watered, the grazing for sheep and cattle\r\nis so scanty during some months of the year that farms are large, houses\r\nare scattered far from one another, and the population remains extremely\r\nthin. The Wilderness of the Karroo cuts off Cape Town and its\r\ncomparatively populous neighbourhood from the inhabited, though thinly\r\ninhabited, pastoral districts of the Orange Free State. Between these\r\ntwo settled districts there are only a few villages, scattered at\r\nintervals of many miles along a line of railway four hundred miles in\r\nlength. In the Free State and the Transvaal the white population is\r\nextremely sparse, save in the mining region of the Witwatersrand,\r\nbecause ranching requires few hands, and only a few hundred square miles\r\nout of many thousands have been brought under cultivation. Thus, while\r\nthe coolness of the climate has permitted Europeans to thrive in these\r\ncomparatively low latitudes, its dryness has kept down their numbers and\r\nhas retarded not only their political development, but their progress in\r\nall those arts and pursuits which imply a tolerably large and varied\r\nsociety. The note of South African life, the thing that strikes the\r\ntraveller with increasing force as he visits one part of the country\r\nafter another, is the paucity of inhabitants, and the isolated life\r\nwhich these inhabitants, except in six or seven towns, are forced to\r\nlead. This is the doing of nature. She has not severed the country into\r\ndistinct social or political communities by any lines of physical\r\ndemarcation, but she has provided such scanty means of sustenance for\r\nhuman life and so few openings for human industry unaided by capital,\r\nthat the settlers (save where capital has come to their aid) remain few\r\nindeed, and one may call the interior of South Africa a vast solitude,\r\nwith a few oases of population dotted here and there over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nASPECTS OF SCENERY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sketch I have given of the physical character of South Africa will\r\ndoubtless have conveyed to the reader that the country offers\r\ncomparatively little to attract the lover of natural scenery. This\r\nimpression is true if the sort of landscape we have learned to enjoy in\r\nEurope and in the eastern part of the United States be taken as the type\r\nof scenery which gives most pleasure. Variety of form, boldness of\r\noutline, the presence of water in lakes and running streams, and, above\r\nall, foliage and verdure, are the main elements of beauty in those\r\nlandscapes; while if any one desires something of more imposing\r\ngrandeur, he finds it in snow-capped mountains like the Alps or the\r\nCascade Range, or in majestic crags such as those which tower over the\r\nfiords of Norway. But the scenery of South Africa is wholly unlike that\r\nof Europe or of most parts of America. It is, above all things, a dry\r\nland, a parched and thirsty land, where no clear brooks murmur through\r\nthe meadow, no cascade sparkles from the cliff, where mountain and plain\r\nalike are brown and dusty except during the short season of the rains.\r\nAnd being a dry land, it is also a bare land. Few are the favoured spots\r\nin which a veritable forest can be seen; for though many tracts are\r\nwooded, the trees are almost always thin and stunted. In Matabililand,\r\nfor instance, though a great part of the surface is covered with wood,\r\nyou see no trees forty feet high, and few reaching thirty; while in the\r\nwilderness of the Kalahari Desert and Damaraland nothing larger than a\r\nbush is visible, except the scraggy and thorny mimosa.\r\n\r\nThese features of South Africa--the want of water and the want of\r\ngreenness--are those to which a native of Western Europe finds it\r\nhardest to accustom himself, however thoroughly he may enjoy the\r\nbrilliant sun and the keen dry air which go along with them. And it must\r\nalso be admitted that over very large areas the aspects of nature are so\r\nuniform as to become monotonous. One may travel eight hundred miles and\r\nsee less variety in the landscape than one would find in one-fourth of\r\nthe same distance anywhere in Western Europe or in America east of the\r\nAlleghany Mountains. The same geological formations prevail over wide\r\nareas, and give the same profile to the hilltop, the same undulations to\r\nthe plain; while in travelling northward toward the Equator the flora\r\nseems to change far less between 34° and 18° south latitude than it\r\nchanges in the journey from Barcelona to Havre, through only half as\r\nmany degrees of latitude.\r\n\r\nThere are, nevertheless, several interesting bits of scenery in South\r\nAfrica, which, if they do not of themselves repay the traveller for so\r\nlong a journey, add sensibly to his enjoyment. The situation of Cape\r\nTown, with a magnificent range of precipices rising behind it, a noble\r\nbay in front, and environs full of beautiful avenues and\r\npleasure-grounds, while bold mountain-peaks close the more distant\r\nlandscape, is equalled by that of few other cities in the world.\r\nConstantinople and Naples, Bombay and San Francisco, cannot boast of\r\nmore perfect or more varied prospects. There are some fine pieces of\r\nwood and water scenery along the south coast of Cape Colony, and one of\r\nsingular charm in the adjoining colony of Natal, where the suburbs of\r\nDurban, the principal port, though they lack the grandeur which its\r\ncraggy heights give to the neighbourhood of Cape Town have, with a\r\nwarmer climate, a richer and more tropically luxuriant vegetation. In\r\nthe great range of mountains which runs some seventeen hundred miles\r\nfrom Cape Town almost to the banks of the Zambesi, the scenery becomes\r\nstriking in three districts only. One of these is Basutoland, a little\r\nnative territory which lies just where Cape Colony, the Orange Free\r\nState, and Natal meet. Its peaks are the highest in Africa south of\r\nMount Kilimanjaro, for several of them reach 11,000 feet. On the\r\nsouth-east this mountain-land, the Switzerland of South Africa, faces\r\nNatal and East Griqualand with a long range of formidable precipices,\r\nimpassable for many miles. The interior contains valleys and glens of\r\nsingular beauty, some wild and rugged, some clothed with rich pasture.\r\nThe voice of brooks, a sound rare in Africa, rises from the hidden\r\ndepths of the gorges, and here and there torrents plunging over the edge\r\nof a basaltic cliff into an abyss below make waterfalls which are at all\r\nseasons beautiful, and when swollen by the rains of January majestic.\r\nExcept wood, of which there is unhappily nothing more than a little\r\nscrubby bush in the sheltered hollows, nearly all the elements of beauty\r\nare present; and the contrast between the craggy summits and the soft\r\nrich pasture and cornlands which lie along their northern base, gives\r\nrise to many admirable landscapes.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred miles north-north-east of Basutoland the great Quathlamba\r\nRange rises in very bold slopes from the coast levels behind Delagoa\r\nBay, and the scenery of the valleys and passes is said to be extremely\r\ngrand. Knowing it, however, only by report, I will not venture to\r\ndescribe it. Nearly five hundred miles still farther to the north, in\r\nthe district called Manicaland, already referred to, is a third mountain\r\nregion, less lofty than Basutoland, but deriving a singular charm from\r\nthe dignity and variety of its mountain forms. The whole country is so\r\nelevated that summits of 7000 or even 8000 feet do not produce any\r\ngreater effect upon the eye than does Ben Lomond as seen from Loch\r\nLomond, or Mount Washington from the Glen House. But there is a boldness\r\nof line about these granite peaks comparable to those of the west coast\r\nof Norway or of the finest parts of the Swiss Alps. Some of them rise in\r\nsmooth shafts of apparently inaccessible rock; others form long ridges\r\nof pinnacles of every kind of shape, specially striking when they stand\r\nout against the brilliantly clear morning or evening sky. The valleys\r\nare well wooded, the lower slopes covered with herbage, so the effect of\r\nthese wild peaks is heightened by the softness of the surroundings which\r\nthey dominate, while at the same time the whole landscape becomes more\r\ncomplex and more noble by the mingling of such diverse elements. No\r\nscenery better deserves the name of romantic. And even in the tamer\r\nparts, where instead of mountains there are only low hills, or \"kopjes\"\r\n(as they are called in South Africa), the slightly more friable rock\r\nfound in these hills decomposes under the influence of the weather into\r\ncuriously picturesque and fantastic forms, with crags riven to their\r\nbase, and detached pillars supporting loose blocks and tabular masses,\r\namong or upon which the timid Mashonas have built their huts in the hope\r\nof escaping the raids of their warlike enemies, the Matabili.\r\n\r\nThough I must admit that South Africa, taken as a whole, offers far less\r\nto attract the lover of natural beauty than does Southern or Western\r\nEurope or the Pacific States of North America, there are two kinds of\r\ncharm which it possesses in a high degree. One is that of colour.\r\nMonotonous as the landscapes often are, there is a warmth and richness\r\nof tone about them which fills and delights the eye. One sees\r\ncomparatively little of that whitish-blue limestone which so often gives\r\na hard and chilling aspect to the scenery of the lower ridges of the\r\nAlps and of large parts of the coasts of the Mediterranean. In Africa\r\neven the grey granite or gneiss has a deeper tone than these limestones,\r\nand it is frequently covered by red and yellow lichens of wonderful\r\nbeauty. The dark basalts and porphyries which occur in many places, the\r\nrich red tint which the surface of the sandstone rocks often takes under\r\nthe scorching sun, give depth of tone to the landscape; and though the\r\nflood of midday sunshine is almost overpowering, the lights of morning\r\nand evening, touching the mountains with every shade of rose and crimson\r\nand violet, are indescribably beautiful. It is in these morning and\r\nevening hours that the charm of the pure dry air is specially felt.\r\nMountains fifty or sixty miles away stand out clearly enough to enable\r\nall the wealth of their colour and all the delicacy of their outlines to\r\nbe perceived; and the eye realises, by the exquisitely fine change of\r\ntint between the nearer and the more distant ranges, the immensity and\r\nthe harmony of the landscape. Europeans may think that the continuous\r\nprofusion of sunlight during most of the year may become wearisome. I\r\nwas not long enough in the country to find it so, and I observed that\r\nthose who have lived for a few years in South Africa declare they prefer\r\nthat continuous profusion to the murky skies of Britain or Holland or\r\nNorth Germany. But even if the fine weather which prevails for eight\r\nmonths in the year be monotonous, there is compensation in the\r\nextraordinary brilliancy of the atmospheric effects throughout the rainy\r\nseason, and especially in its first weeks. During nine days which I\r\nspent in the Transvaal at that season, when several thunderstorms\r\noccurred almost every day, the combinations of sunshine, lightning, and\r\ncloud, and the symphonies--if the expression may be permitted--of light\r\nand shade and colour which their changeful play produced in the sky and\r\non the earth, were more various and more wonderful than a whole year\r\nwould furnish forth for enjoyment in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe other peculiar charm which South African scenery possesses is that\r\nof primeval solitude and silence. It is a charm which is differently\r\nfelt by different minds. There are many who find the presence of what\r\nHomer calls \"the rich works of men\" essential to the perfection of a\r\nlandscape. Cultivated fields, gardens, and orchards, farmhouses dotted\r\nhere and there, indications in one form or another of human life and\r\nlabour, do not merely give a greater variety to every prospect, but also\r\nimpart an element which evokes the sense of sympathy with our\r\nfellow-beings, and excites a whole group of emotions which the\r\ncontemplation of nature, taken by itself, does not arouse. No one is\r\ninsensible to these things and some find little delight in any scene\r\nfrom which they are absent. Yet there are other minds to which there is\r\nsomething specially solemn and impressive in the untouched and primitive\r\nsimplicity of a country which stands now just as it came from the hands\r\nof the Creator. The self-sufficingness of nature, the insignificance of\r\nman, the mystery of a universe which does not exist, as our ancestors\r\nfondly thought, for the sake of man, but for other purposes hidden from\r\nus and for ever undiscoverable--these things are more fully realised and\r\nmore deeply felt when one traverses a boundless wilderness which seems\r\nto have known no change since the remote ages when hill and plain and\r\nvalley were moulded into the forms we see to-day. Feelings of this kind\r\npowerfully affect the mind of the traveller in South Africa. They affect\r\nhim in the Karroo, where the slender line of rails, along which his\r\ntrain creeps all day and all night across wide stretches of brown desert\r\nand under the crests of stern dark hills, seems to heighten by contrast\r\nthe sense of solitude--a vast and barren solitude interposed between the\r\nbusy haunts of men which he has left behind on the shores of the ocean\r\nand those still busier haunts whither he is bent, where the pick and\r\nhammer sound upon the Witwatersrand, and the palpitating engine drags\r\nmasses of ore from the depths of the crowded mine. They affect him still\r\nmore in the breezy highlands of Matabililand, where the eye ranges over\r\nan apparently endless succession of undulations clothed with tall grass\r\nor waving wood, till they sink in the blue distance toward the plain\r\nthrough which the great Zambesi takes its seaward course.\r\n\r\nThe wilderness is indeed not wholly unpeopled. Over the wide surface of\r\nMatabililand and Mashonaland--an area of some two hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles--there are scattered natives of various tribes, whose\r\nnumbers have been roughly estimated at from 250,000 to 400,000 persons.\r\nBut one rarely sees a native except along a few well-beaten tracks, and\r\nstill more rarely comes upon a cluster of huts in the woods along the\r\nstreamlets or half hidden among the fissured rocks of a granite kopje.\r\nThe chief traces of man's presence in the landscape are the narrow and\r\nwinding footpaths which run hither and thither through the country, and\r\nbewilder the traveller who, having strayed from his waggon, vainly hopes\r\nby following them to find his way back to the main track, or the wreaths\r\nof blue smoke which indicate the spot where a Kafir has set the grass on\r\nfire to startle and kill the tiny creatures that dwell in it.\r\n\r\nNothing is at first more surprising to one who crosses a country\r\ninhabited by savages than the few marks of their presence which strike\r\nthe eye, or at least an unpractised eye. The little plot of ground the\r\nKafirs have cultivated is in a few years scarcely distinguishable from\r\nthe untouched surface of the surrounding land, while the mud-built hut\r\nquickly disappears under the summer rains and the scarcely less\r\ndestructive efforts of the white ants. Here in South Africa the native\r\nraces seem to have made no progress for centuries, if, indeed, they have\r\nnot actually gone backward; and the feebleness of savage man\r\nintensifies one's sense of the overmastering strength of nature. The\r\nelephant and the buffalo are as much the masters of the soil as is the\r\nKafir, and man has no more right to claim that the land was made for him\r\nthan have the wild beasts of the forest who roar after their prey and\r\nseek their meat from God.\r\n\r\nThese features of South African nature, its silence, its loneliness, its\r\ndrear solemnity, have not been without their influence upon the mind and\r\ntemper of the European settler. The most peculiar and characteristic\r\ntype that the country has produced is the Boer of the eastern plateau,\r\nthe offspring of those Dutch Africanders who some sixty years ago\r\nwandered away from British rule into the wilderness. These men had, and\r\ntheir sons and grandsons have retained, a passion for solitude that even\r\nto-day makes them desire to live many miles from any neighbour, a sturdy\r\nself-reliance, a grim courage in the face of danger, a sternness from\r\nwhich the native races have often had to suffer. The majesty of nature\r\nhas not stimulated in them any poetical faculty. But her austerity,\r\njoined to the experiences of their race, has contributed to make them\r\ngrave and serious, closely bound to their ancient forms of piety, and\r\nprone to deem themselves the special objects of divine protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n_A SKETCH OF SOUTH AFRICAN HISTORY_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE NATIVES: HOTTENTOTS, BUSHMEN, AND KAFIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy far the most interesting features in the history of South Africa have\r\nbeen the relations to one another of the various races that inhabit it.\r\nThere are seven of these races, three native and four European. The\r\nEuropean races, two of them, especially the Dutch and the English, are,\r\nof course, far stronger, and far more important as political factors,\r\nthan are the natives. Nevertheless, the natives have an importance too,\r\nand one so great that their position deserves to be fully set forth and\r\ncarefully weighed. For, though they are inferior in every point but one,\r\nthey are in that point strong. They are prolific. They already greatly\r\noutnumber the whites, and they increase faster.\r\n\r\nThe cases of conflict or contact between civilized European man and\r\nsavage or semi-civilized aboriginal peoples, which have been very\r\nnumerous since the tide of discovery began to rise in the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, may be reduced to three classes.\r\n\r\nThe first of these classes includes the cases where the native race,\r\nthough perhaps numerous, is comparatively weak, and unable to assimilate\r\nEuropean civilization, or to thrive under European rule (a rule which\r\nhas often been harsh), or even to survive in the presence of a European\r\npopulation occupying its country. To this class belong such cases as the\r\nextinction of the natives of the Antilles by the Spaniards, the\r\ndisappearance of the natives of Southern Australia and Tasmania before\r\nBritish settlement, the dying out, or retirement to a few reserved\r\ntracts, of the aborigines who once occupied all North America east of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. The Russian advance in Siberia, the advance of\r\nSpanish and Italian and German colonists in the territories of La Plata\r\nin South America, may be added to this class, for though the phenomena\r\nare rather those of absorption than of extinction, the result is\r\npractically the same. The country becomes European and the native races\r\nvanish.\r\n\r\nAn opposite class of cases arises where Europeans have conquered a\r\ncountry already filled by a more or less civilized population, which is\r\nso numerous and so prolific as to maintain itself with ease in their\r\npresence. Such a case is the British conquest of India. The Europeans in\r\nIndia are, and must remain, a mere handful among the many millions of\r\nindustrious natives, who already constitute, in many districts, a\r\npopulation almost too numerous for the resources of the country to\r\nsupport. Moreover, the climate is one in which a pure European race\r\nspeedily dwindles away. The position of the Dutch in Java, and of the\r\nFrench in Indo-China, is similar; and the French in Madagascar will\r\ndoubtless present another instance.\r\n\r\nBetween these two extremes lies a third group of cases--those in which\r\nthe native race is, on the one hand, numerous and strong enough to\r\nmaintain itself in the face of Europeans, while, on the other hand,\r\nthere is plenty of room left for a considerable European population to\r\npress in, climatic conditions not forbidding it to spread and multiply.\r\nTo this group belong such colonizations as those of the Spaniards in\r\nMexico and Peru, of the Russians in parts of Central Asia, of the French\r\nin Algeria and Tunis, of the Spaniards in the Canary Isles, and of the\r\nEnglish and Americans in Hawaii. In all these countries the new race and\r\nthe old race can both live and thrive, neither of them killing off or\r\ncrowding out the other, though in some, as in Hawaii, the natives tend\r\nto disappear, while in others, as in Algeria, the immigrants do not much\r\nincrease. Sometimes, as in the Canary Isles and Mexico, the two elements\r\nblend, the native element being usually more numerous, though less\r\nadvanced; and a mixed race is formed by intermarriage. Sometimes they\r\nremain, and seem likely to remain, as distinct as oil is from water.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa belongs to this third class of cases. The Dutch and the\r\nEnglish find the country a good one and become fond of it. There is\r\nplenty of land for them. They enjoy the climate. They thrive and\r\nmultiply. But they do not oust the natives, except sometimes from the\r\nbest lands, and the contact does not reduce the number of the latter.\r\nThe native--that is to say, the native of the Kafir race--not merely\r\nholds his ground, but increases far more rapidly than he did before\r\nEuropeans came, because the Europeans have checked intertribal wars and\r\nthe slaughter of the tribesmen by the chiefs and their wizards, and also\r\nbecause the Europeans have opened up new kinds of employment. As,\r\ntherefore, the native will certainly remain, and will, indeed, probably\r\ncontinue to be in a vast majority, it is vital to a comprehension of\r\nSouth African problems to know what he has been and may be expected to\r\nbecome.\r\n\r\nThe native races are three, and the differences between them are marked,\r\nbeing differences not only of physical appearance and of language, but\r\nalso of character, habits, and grade of civilization. These three are\r\nthe Bushmen, the Hottentots, and those Bantu tribes whom we call Kafirs.\r\n\r\nThe Bushmen were, to all appearance, the first on the ground, the real\r\naborigines of South Africa. They are one of the lowest races to be found\r\nanywhere, as low as the Fuegians or the \"black fellows\" of Australia,\r\nthough perhaps not quite so low as the Veddahs of Ceylon or the now\r\nextinct natives of Tasmania. They seem to have been originally\r\nscattered over all South Africa, from the Zambesi to the Cape, and so\r\nlate as eighty years ago were almost the only inhabitants of Basutoland,\r\nwhere now none of them are left. They were nomads of the most primitive\r\ntype, neither tilling the soil nor owning cattle, but living on such\r\nwild creatures as they could catch or smite with their poisoned arrows,\r\nand, when these failed, upon wild fruits and the roots of plants. For\r\nthe tracking and trapping of game they had a marvellous faculty, such as\r\nneither the other races nor any European could equal. But they had no\r\norganization, not even a tribal one, for they wandered about in small\r\ngroups; and no religion beyond some vague notion of ghosts, and of\r\nspirits inhabiting or connected with natural objects; while their\r\nlanguage was a succession of clicks interrupted by grunts. Very low in\r\nstature, and possibly cognate to the pygmies whom Mr. H.M. Stanley found\r\nin Central Africa, they were capable of enduring great fatigue and of\r\ntravelling very swiftly. Untamably fierce unless caught in childhood,\r\nand incapable of accustoming themselves to civilized life, driven out of\r\nsome districts by the European settlers, who were often forced to shoot\r\nthem down in self-defence, and in other regions no longer able to find\r\nsupport owing to the disappearance of the game, they are now almost\r\nextinct, though a few remain in the Kalahari Desert and the adjoining\r\nparts of northern Bechuanaland and western Matabililand, toward Lake\r\nNgami. I saw at the Kimberley mines two or three dwarf natives who were\r\nsaid to have Bushmen blood in them, but it is no longer easy to find in\r\nthe Colony a pure specimen. Before many years the only trace of their\r\nexistence will be in the remarkable drawings of wild animals with which\r\nthey delighted to cover the smooth surfaces of sheltered rocks. These\r\ndrawings, which are found all the way from the Zambesi to the Cape, and\r\nfrom Manicaland westward, are executed in red, yellow, and black\r\npigments, and are often full of spirit. Rude, of course, they are, but\r\nthey often convey the aspect, and especially the characteristic\r\nattitude, of the animal with great fidelity.\r\n\r\nThe second native race was that which the Dutch called Hottentot, and\r\nwhom the Portuguese explorers found occupying the maritime region in the\r\nsouth-west corner of the continent, to the east and to the north of the\r\nCape of Good Hope. They are supposed to have come from the north and\r\ndispossessed the Bushmen of the grassy coast lands, driving them into\r\nthe more arid interior. But of this there is no evidence; and some have\r\neven fancied that the Hottentot race itself may have been a mixed one,\r\nproduced by intermarriage between Bushmen and Kafirs. Be this as it may,\r\nthe Hottentots were superior to the Bushmen both physically and\r\nintellectually. They were small men, but not pygmies, of a reddish or\r\nyellowish black hue, with no great muscular power in their slender\r\nframes. Their hair, very short and woolly, grew, like that of the\r\nBushmen, in small balls or tufts over the skull, just as grass tufts\r\ngrow separate from one another in the drier parts of the veldt. They\r\npossessed sheep and also cattle, lean beasts with huge horns; and they\r\nroved hither and thither over the country as they could find pasture for\r\ntheir animals, doing a little hunting, but not attempting to till the\r\nsoil, and unacquainted with the metals. Living in tribes under their\r\nchiefs, they fought a little with one another, and a great deal with the\r\nBushmen, who tried to prey upon their cattle. They were a thoughtless,\r\ncheerful, good-natured, merry sort of people, whom it was not difficult\r\nto domesticate as servants, and their relations with the Dutch settlers,\r\nin spite of two wars, were, on the whole, friendly. Within a century\r\nafter the foundation of Cape Colony, their numbers, never large, had\r\nvastly diminished, partly from the occupation by the colonists of their\r\nbest grazing-grounds, but still more from the ravages of small-pox and\r\nother epidemics, which ships touching on their way from the East Indies\r\nbrought into the country. In A.D. 1713 whole tribes perished in this\r\nway. I speak of the Hottentots in the past tense, for they are now, as a\r\ndistinct race, almost extinct in the Colony, although a good deal of\r\ntheir blood has passed into the mixed coloured population of Cape Town\r\nand its neighbourhood--a population the other elements of which are\r\nMalays from the Dutch East Indies, and the descendants of slaves brought\r\nfrom the West Coast of Africa in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies. From unions between Hottentot women and the Dutch sprang the\r\nmixed race whom the Dutch call Bastards and the English Griquas, and\r\nwho, though now dying out, like the French and Indian half-breeds of\r\nWestern Canada, played at one time a considerable part in colonial\r\npolitics. Along the south bank of the Orange River and to the north of\r\nit, in Great Namaqualand, small tribes, substantially identical with the\r\nHottentots, still wander over the arid wilderness. But in the settled\r\nparts of the Colony the Hottentot, of whom we used to hear so much, and\r\nwhom the Portuguese remembering the death of the viceroy D'Almeida (who\r\nwas killed in a skirmish in A.D. 1510), at one time feared so much, has\r\nvanished more completely than has the Red Indian from the Atlantic\r\nStates of North America. And the extinction or absorption of the few\r\nremaining nomads will probably follow at no distant date.\r\n\r\nVery different have been the fortunes, very different are the prospects,\r\nof the third and far more numerous South African race, those whom we\r\ncall Kafirs, and who call themselves Abantu or Bantu (\"the people\"). The\r\nword \"Kafir\" is Arabic. It has nothing to do with Mount Kaf (the\r\nCaucasus), but means an infidel (literally, \"one who denies\"), and is\r\napplied by Mussulmans not merely to these people, but to other heathen\r\nalso, as, for instance, to the idolaters of Kafiristan, in the\r\nHindu-Kush Mountains. The Portuguese doubtless took the name from the\r\nArabs, whom they found established at several points on the East African\r\ncoast northward from Sofala, and the Dutch took it from the Portuguese,\r\ntogether with such words as \"kraal\" (corral), and \"assagai.\" The Bantu\r\ntribes, if one may include under that name all the blacks who speak\r\nlanguages of the same general type, occupy the whole of East Africa\r\nsouthward from the Upper Nile, where that river issues from the great\r\nNyanza lakes, together with the Congo basin and most of South-west\r\nAfrica. They include various groups, such as the Ama-Kosa tribes (to\r\nwhich belong the Tembus and Pondos), who dwell on the coast of Cape\r\nColony eastward from the Great Fish River; the Ama-Zulu group,\r\nconsisting of the Zulus proper (in Natal and Zululand), the Swazis, the\r\nMatabili, farther to the north, and the Angoni, in Nyassaland, beyond\r\nthe Zambesi River; the Amatonga group, between Zululand and Delagoa Bay;\r\nthe Bechuana group, including the Bamangwato, the Basuto and the\r\nBarolongs, as well as the Barotse, far off on the middle course of the\r\nZambesi; the Makalaka or Maholi, and cognate tribes, inhabiting\r\nMashonaland and Manicaland. The linguistic and ethnical affinities of\r\nthese groups and tribes are still very imperfectly known, but their\r\nspeech and their habits are sufficiently similar to enable us to refer\r\nthem to one type, just as we do the Finnic or the Slavonic peoples in\r\nEurope. And they are even more markedly unlike the Hottentots or the\r\nBushmen than the Slavs are to the Finns, or both of these to those\r\ninteresting aborigines of northern Europe, the Lapps.\r\n\r\nThe Bantu or Kafirs--I use the term as synonymous--who dwell south of\r\nthe Zambesi are usually strong and well-made men, not below the average\r\nheight of a European. In colour they vary a good deal; some are as black\r\nas the Gulf of Guinea negro, some rather brown than black. All have the\r\nthick lips, the woolly hair, and the scanty beard of the negro, and\r\nnearly all the broad, low nose; yet in some the nose is fairly high,\r\nand the cast of features suggests an admixture of Semitic blood--an\r\nadmixture which could be easily explained by the presence, from a pretty\r\nremote time, of Arab settlers, as well as traders, along the coast of\r\nthe Indian Ocean. As the Bantu vary in aspect, so do they also in\r\nintelligence. No tribe is in this respect conspicuously superior to any\r\nother, though the Zulus show more courage in fight than most of the\r\nothers, the Fingos more aptitude for trade, the Basutos more disposition\r\nto steady industry. But, while the general level of intellect is below\r\nthat of the Red Indians or the Maoris or the Hawaiians (if rather above\r\nthat of the Guinea negroes), individuals are now and then found of\r\nconsiderable talents and great force of character. Three such men as the\r\nZulu Tshka, the Basuto Moshesh, and the Bechuana Khama, not to speak of\r\nthose who, like the eloquent missionary Tiyo Soga, have received a\r\nregular European education, are sufficient to show the capacity of the\r\nrace for occasionally reaching a standard which white men must respect.\r\nAnd in one regard the Bantu race shows a kind of strength which the Red\r\nIndians and Polynesians lack. They are a very prolific people, and under\r\nthe conditions of peace which European rule secures they multiply with a\r\nrapidity which some deem alarming.\r\n\r\nHow long the various Bantu tribes have been in South Africa is a\r\nquestion on which no light has yet been thrown, or can, indeed, be\r\nexpected. Some of them have a vague tradition that they came from the\r\nnorth; but the recollections of savages seldom go back more than five or\r\nsix generations, and retain little except the exploits or the genealogy\r\nof some conspicuous chief. When the Portuguese arrived in the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, they found Kafirs already inhabiting the country from\r\nNatal northward. But apparently they did not then extend as far to the\r\nwest of Natal as they do now; and there is no reason to think that\r\nconsiderable parts of the interior, such as the region which is now the\r\nOrange Free State and Basutoland, were not yet occupied, but left to the\r\nwandering Bushmen. The Kafirs were then, and continued down to our own\r\ntime, in a state of incessant tribal warfare; and from time to time one\r\nmartial tribe, under a forceful chief, would exterminate or chase away\r\nsome weaker clan and reduce wide areas to a wilderness. Of any large\r\nconquests, or of any steady progress in the arts either of war or of\r\npeace, there is no record, and indeed, in the general darkness, no\r\ntrace. The history of the native races, so far as ascertainable, begins\r\nwith the advent of the whites, and even after their advent remains\r\nextremely shadowy until, early in this century, the onward march of\r\nsettlement gave the Dutch and English settlers the means of becoming\r\nbetter acquainted with their black neighbours.\r\n\r\nAcross this darkness there strikes one ray of light. It is a very faint\r\nray, but in the absence of all other light it is precious. It is that\r\nwhich is supplied by the prehistoric ruins and the abandoned\r\ngold-workings of Mashonaland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nOUT OF THE DARKNESS--ZIMBABWYE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ruined buildings of Mashonaland and Matabililand have excited in\r\nrecent years an amount of interest and curiosity which is\r\ndisproportionate to their number, size, and beauty, but by no means\r\ndisproportionate to their value as being the only record, scant as it\r\nis, we possess of what has been deemed an early South African\r\ncivilization. I will describe in the fewest words such of these\r\nbuildings as I saw, leaving the reader of archæological tastes to find\r\nfuller details in the well-known book of that enterprising explorer, the\r\nlate Mr. Theodore Bent. Some short account of them seems all the more\r\nneeded, because the first descriptions published gave the impression\r\nthat they were far more considerable than they really are.\r\n\r\nScattered over the plateau of southern Mashonaland and Matabililand,\r\nfrom its mountainous edge on the east to the neighbourhood of Tati on\r\nthe west, there are to be found fragments of walls built of small blocks\r\nof granite resembling paving stones (usually about a foot long by six\r\ninches high), but often larger, not cut smooth, but chipped or trimmed\r\nto a fairly uniform size. These walls are without mortar or other\r\ncementing material, but the stones are so neatly set together, and the\r\nwall usually so thick, that the structure is compact and cohesive. The\r\nwalls are mostly thinner at the top than at the base. The only\r\nornamentation consists in placing some of the layers at an acute angle\r\nto the other layers above and below, so as to produce what is called the\r\nherring-bone pattern. Occasionally a different pattern is obtained by\r\nleaving spaces at intervals between the horizontal stones of certain\r\nlayers, making a kind of diaper. In some cases this ornamentation,\r\nalways very simple, occurs only on one part of the wall, and it has been\r\nsaid that it occurs usually if not invariably on the part which faces\r\nthe east. I heard of ten or twelve such pieces of wall in different\r\nparts of the plateau, and saw photographs of most of these. Probably\r\nothers exist, for many districts, especially in the hills, have been\r\nimperfectly explored, and trees easily conceal these low erections. One\r\nwas described to me, where the walls are the facings of seven terraces,\r\nrising one above another to a sort of platform on the top. This I have\r\nnot seen; but it is probably similar to one which I did see and examine\r\nat a place called Dhlodhlo, about fifty miles south-east of Bulawayo.\r\nThis group of ruins, one of the most interesting in the country, stands\r\nhigh among rocky hills, from which a superb view is gained over the wide\r\nstretches of rolling table-land to the north and north-west, a charming\r\nsituation which might have attracted the old builders did they possess\r\nany sense of beauty. On a low eminence there has been erected such a\r\nwall of such hewn, or rather trimmed, stones as I have just described.\r\nIt is now about twenty feet in height, and may have originally been\r\nhigher. On the eastern side this wall consists of three parts, each\r\nabout six feet high, with two narrow terraces, each from five to six\r\nfeet wide, between them, the second wall rising from the first terrace,\r\nand the third or highest wall from the second terrace. On this side some\r\nof the stone courses have the simple forms of ornamental pattern already\r\nmentioned. On the opposite, or western and north-western, side only one\r\nterrace and a low, unornamented wall of trimmed stones are now\r\ndiscernible. To the north, still within what seems to have been the main\r\ninclosing wall, are small inclosures built of trimmed stone, which may\r\nhave been chambers originally roofed with wood or bushes. At the top of\r\nthe highest wall there is at the north-north-west end a small level\r\nplatform of earth or rubble, which seems to have been filled in behind\r\nthe terraced walls. This platform is approached by a narrow passage\r\nbetween walls of trimmed stone, at one point in which there appears to\r\nhave been a sort of narrow gateway barely wide enough for two persons to\r\npass. There is no trace of any stone building on the top of the\r\nplatform, and the remains of clay huts which one finds there may well be\r\nquite modern. To the south of this principal structure there is a second\r\nsmall hill or boss of granite, protected on three sides by steep sheets\r\nof granite rock. Its top is inclosed by a low wall of trimmed stones,\r\nnow in places quite broken away, with no trace of any stone building\r\nwithin. All round on the lower ground are large inclosures rudely built\r\nof rough stones, and probably intended for cattle-kraals. They may be\r\nquite modern, and they throw no light on the purpose of the ancient\r\nbuildings. Nor is much light to be obtained from the objects which have\r\nbeen found in the ruins. When I was there they were being searched by\r\nthe Mashonaland Ancient Ruins Exploration Company, a company authorized\r\nby the British South Africa Company to dig and scrape in the ancient\r\nbuildings of the country for gold or whatever else of value may be there\r\ndiscoverable, an enterprise which, though it may accelerate the progress\r\nof archæological inquiry, obviously requires to be conducted with great\r\ncare and by competent persons. So far as I could observe, all due care\r\nwas being used by the gentleman in charge of the work at Dhlodhlo; but\r\nconsidering how easy it is to obliterate the distinctive features of a\r\nruin and leave it in a condition unfavourable to future examination, it\r\nseems desirable that the company should, as a rule, await the arrival of\r\ntrained archæologists rather than hurry on explorations by amateurs,\r\nhowever zealous and well intentioned. Of the objects found, which were\r\ncourteously shown to me, some are modern, such as the bits of pottery,\r\napparently Indian or Chinese, the bits of glass, the bullets and\r\nfragments of flint-lock muskets, a small cannon, and an iron hammer.\r\nThese are doubtless of Portuguese origin, though it does not follow that\r\nany Portuguese expedition ever penetrated so far inland, for they may\r\nhave been gifts or purchases from the Portuguese established on the\r\ncoast four or five hundred miles away. So, too, the silver and copper\r\nornaments found, and some of the gold ones (occasionally alloyed with\r\ncopper), which show patterns apparently Portuguese, may be recent. There\r\nare also, however, some gold ornaments, such as beads, bangles (a\r\nskeleton was found with bangles on the legs and a bead necklace), and\r\npieces of twisted gold wire, which may be far more ancient, and indeed\r\nas old as the structure itself. A small crucible with nuggets and small\r\nbits of gold goes to indicate that smelting was carried on, though the\r\nnearest ancient gold-workings are six miles distant. Probably here, as\r\nat Hissarlik and at Carthage, there exist remains from a long succession\r\nof centuries, the spot having been occupied from remote antiquity.[6] At\r\npresent it is not only uninhabited, but regarded by the natives with\r\nfear. They believe it to be haunted by the ghosts of the departed, and\r\nare unwilling, except in the daytime and for wages paid by the\r\nExploration Company, to touch or even to enter the ruins. They can\r\nhardly be persuaded even to relate such traditions as exist regarding\r\nthe place. All that has been gathered is that it was the dwelling of a\r\nline of _mambos_, or chiefs, the last of whom was burned here by\r\nMosilikatze, the Matabili king, when he conquered the country sixty\r\nyears ago. (The place does show marks of fire.) But the buildings were\r\nhere long before the mambos reigned, and who built them, or why, no one\r\nknows. The natives come sometimes to make offerings to ancestral ghosts,\r\nespecially when they ask for success in hunting; and if the hunt be\r\nsuccessful, strips of meat are cut off and placed in cleft sticks for\r\nthe benefit of the ghosts.\r\n\r\nThree hypotheses have been advanced regarding the Dhlodhlo building. One\r\nregards them as a fortress. The objection to this is that the terraced\r\nand ornamented wall is so far from contributing to defence that it\r\nactually facilitates attack; for, by the help of the terraces and of the\r\ninterstices among the stones which the ornamental pattern supplies, an\r\nactive man could easily scale it in front. Moreover, there is hard by,\r\nto the north, a higher and more abrupt hill which would have offered a\r\nfar better site for a fort. The second view is that Dhlodhlo was a\r\nmining station, where slaves were kept at work; but if so, why was it\r\nnot placed near the old gold-workings instead of some miles off, and of\r\nwhat use were the terraced walls? The inquirer is therefore led to the\r\nthird view--that the building was in some way connected with religious\r\nworship, and that the ornament which is seen along the eastern wall was\r\nplaced there with some religious motive. There is, however, nothing\r\nwhatever to indicate the nature of that worship, nor the race that\r\npractised it, for no objects of a possibly religious character (such as\r\nthose I shall presently mention at Zimbabwye) have been found here.\r\n\r\nI visited a second ruin among the mountains of Mashonaland, near the\r\nLezapi River, at a place called Chipadzi's grave, a mile from the kraal\r\nof a chief named Chipunza. Here a rocky granite kopje, almost\r\ninaccessible on two sides, is protected on one of the other sides by a\r\nneatly built wall of well-trimmed stones, similar to that of Dhlodhlo,\r\nbut without ornament. The piece that remains is some fifty yards long,\r\nfive feet thick at the base, and eleven feet high at its highest point.\r\nIt is obviously a wall of defence, for the only erections within are\r\nlow, rough inclosures of loose stones, and three clay huts, one of which\r\ncovers the grave of Chipadzi, a chief who died some twenty years ago,\r\nand who was doubtless interred here because the place was secluded and\r\nalready in a fashion consecrated by the presence of the ancient wall.\r\nThat the wall is ancient hardly admits of doubt, for it is quite unlike\r\nany of the walls--there are not many in the country--which the Kafirs\r\nnow build, these being always of stones entirely untrimmed and very\r\nloosely fitted together, though sometimes plastered with mud to make\r\nthem hold.[7] There is nothing to see beyond the wall itself, and the\r\nonly interest of the place is in its showing that the race who built\r\nDhlodhlo and other similar walls in Matibililand were probably here\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nMuch larger and more remakable is the group of ruins (situated seventeen\r\nmiles from Fort Victoria, in southern Mashonaland) which goes by the\r\nname of the Great Zimbabwye. This Bantu word is said to denote a stone\r\nbuilding, but has often been used to describe the residence of a great\r\nchief, whatever the materials of which it is constructed. It is a common\r\nnoun, and not the name of one particular place. Europeans, however,\r\nconfine it to this one ruin, or rather to two ruined buildings near\r\neach other. One of these is on the top of a rocky and in parts\r\nprecipitous hill, the other in a valley half a mile from the foot of the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nThe first, which we may call the Fort, consists of a line of wall, in\r\nparts double, defending the more accessible parts of the eastern and\r\nsouth-eastern end of the hill or kopje, which is about 500 feet high,\r\nand breaks down on its southern side in a nearly vertical sheet of\r\ngranite. The walls, which in some places are thirty feet high, are all\r\nbuilt of small trimmed blocks of granite such as I have already\r\ndescribed, without mortar, but neatly fitted together. They are in\r\nexcellent preservation, and are skilfully constructed in a sort of\r\nlabyrinth, so as to cover all the places where an enemy might approach.\r\nFrom the openings in the wall, where doors were probably placed,\r\npassages are carried inward, very narrow and winding, so that only one\r\nperson at a time can pass, and completely commanded by the high wall on\r\neither side. Everything speaks of defence, and everything is very well\r\nadapted, considering the rudeness of the materials, for efficient\r\ndefence. There is no sort of ornament in the walls, except that here and\r\nthere at the entrances some stones are laid transversely to the others,\r\nand that certain long, thin pieces of a slaty stone, rounded so that one\r\nmight call them stone poles--they are about five to seven feet\r\nlong--project from the top of the wall. Neither is there any trace of an\r\narch or vaulted roof. None of what look like chambers has a roof. They\r\nwere doubtless covered with the branches of trees. Very few objects have\r\nbeen found throwing any light on the object of the building or its\r\nbuilders, and these have been now removed, except some small pieces of\r\nsandstone, a rock not found in the neighbourhood, which (it has been\r\nconjectured) may have been brought for the purposes of mining.\r\n\r\nThe other building is much more remarkable. It stands on a slight\r\neminence in the level ground between the hill on which the Fort stands\r\nand another somewhat lower granite hill, and is about a third of a mile\r\nfrom the Fort. It consists of a wall, rather elliptical than circular in\r\nform, from thirty to forty feet high, fourteen feet thick near the\r\nground, and from six to nine thick at the top, where one can walk along\r\na considerable part with little difficulty. This wall is built of the\r\nsame small, well-trimmed blocks of granite, nicely fitted together, and\r\nfor more than half the circumference is in excellent preservation,\r\nalthough shrubs and climbing vines have here and there rooted themselves\r\nin it. The rest of it is more or less broken, and in one place quite\r\noverthrown. There are two gates, at the west and the north. The wall is\r\nquite plain, except for about one-third (or perhaps a little less) of\r\nthe outer face, where there is such an ornament as I have already\r\ndescribed, of two courses of stones set slantingly at an acute angle to\r\nthe ordinary flat courses above and below. These two courses are the\r\nfifth and seventh from the top. In the space surrounded by the wall,\r\nwhich is about three-quarters of an acre, are some small inclosures of\r\ntrimmed stone, apparently chambers. There is also a singular wall\r\nrunning parallel to the inner face of the great inclosing wall for some\r\ntwenty yards, leaving between it and that inner face a very narrow\r\npassage, which at one point must have been closed by a door (probably of\r\nstone), for at that point steps lead up on either side, and hollow\r\nspaces fit for receiving a door remain. At one end this passage opens\r\ninto a small open space, where the most curious of all the erections are\r\nto be found, namely, two solid towers of trimmed stones. One of these is\r\nquite low, rising only some five feet from the ground. The other is more\r\nthan forty feet high, overtopping the great inclosing wall (from which\r\nit is eight feet distant) by about five feet, and has a bluntly conical\r\ntop. It reminds one a little of an Irish round tower, though not so\r\nhigh, save that the Irish towers are hollow and this solid, or of a\r\nBuddhist tope, save that the topes which are solid, are very much\r\nthicker. There is nothing whatever to indicate the purpose of this\r\ntower, but the fact that the space in which it and the smaller tower\r\nstand is cut off from the rest of the enclosed area by a pretty high\r\nwall seems to show that it was meant to be specially protected or was\r\ndeemed to be specially sacred.\r\n\r\nOutside the main inclosing wall are several small inclosures of\r\nirregular shape, surrounded by similar walls of trimmed stones, but all\r\nlow and broken and with nothing inside. One of these joins on to the\r\nmain wall of the great inclosure.\r\n\r\nThis is all that there is to see at Zimbabwye. What I have described\r\nseems little, and that little is simple, even rude. The interest lies in\r\nguessing what the walls were built for, and by whom. Comparatively\r\nlittle has been discovered by digging. No inscriptions whatever have\r\nbeen found. Some figures of birds rudely carved in a sort of soapstone\r\nwere fixed along the top of the walls of the Fort, and have been removed\r\nto the Cape Town museum. It is thought that they represent vultures, and\r\nthe vulture was a bird of religious significance among some of the\r\nSemitic nations. Fragments of soapstone bowls were discovered, some with\r\nfigures of animals carved on them, some with geometrical patterns, while\r\non one were marks which might possibly belong to some primitive\r\nalphabet. There were also whorls somewhat resembling those which occur\r\nso profusely in the ruins of Troy, and stone objects which may be\r\nphalli, though some at least of them are deemed by the authorities of\r\nthe British Museum (to whom I have shown them) to be probably pieces\r\nused for playing a game like that of fox-and-geese. The iron and bronze\r\nweapons which were found may have been comparatively modern, but the\r\nsmall crucibles for smelting gold, with tools and a curious ingot-mould\r\n(said to resemble ancient moulds used at tin workings) were apparently\r\nancient.\r\n\r\nWhat purpose were these buildings meant to serve? That on the hill was\r\nevidently a stronghold, and a stronghold of a somewhat elaborate kind,\r\nerected against an enemy deemed formidable. The large building below can\r\nhardly have been a place of defence, because it stands on level ground\r\nwith a high, rocky hill just above it, which would have afforded a much\r\nstronger situation. Neither was it a mining station, for the nearest\r\nplace where any trace of gold has been found is seven miles away, and in\r\na mining station, even if meant to hold slave workers, there would have\r\nbeen no use for a wall so lofty as this. Two hypotheses remain: that\r\nthis was the residence of a chief, or that it was erected for the\r\npurposes of religious worship. It may have been both--a palace, so to\r\nspeak, with a temple attached. The presence of the inner inclosure,\r\nguarded by its separate wall, and with its curious tower, is most\r\nplausibly explained by supposing a religious purpose; for as religion is\r\nthe strangest of all human things, and that in which men most vary, so\r\nit is naturally called in to explain what is otherwise inexplicable.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the religion of those who built this shrine, if shrine\r\nit was? The ornamentation of that part of the outer wall which faces the\r\nrising sun suggests sun-worship. The phalli (if they are phalli) point\r\nto one of the Oriental forms of the worship of the forces of nature. The\r\nbirds' heads may have a religious significance, and possibly the\r\nsignificance which it is said that vultures had in the Syrian\r\nnature-worship. These data give some slight presumptions, yet the field\r\nfor conjecture remains a very wide one, and there is nothing in the\r\nbuildings to indicate the particular race who erected the Fort and the\r\nTemple (if it was a temple). However, the tower bears some resemblance\r\nto a tower which appears within a town wall on an ancient coin of the\r\nPhoenician city of Byblus; and this coincidence, slight enough, has,\r\nin the dearth of other light, been used to support the view that the\r\nbuilders belonged to some Semitic race.\r\n\r\nHad we nothing but the ruined walls of Zimbabwye, Dhlodhlo, and the\r\nother spots where similar ruins have been observed, the problem would be\r\ninsoluble. We could only say that the existing native races had at some\r\napparently distant time been more civilized than they are now and\r\ncapable of building walls they do not now build, or else we should\r\nsuppose that some now extinct race had built these. But there are other\r\nfacts known to us which suggest, though they do not establish, an\r\nhypothesis regarding the early history of the country.\r\n\r\nIn very remote times there existed, as is known from the Egyptian\r\nmonuments, a trade from South-east Africa into the Red Sea. The\r\nremarkable sculptures at Deir el Bahari, near Luxor, dating from the\r\ntime of Queen Hatasu, sister of the great conqueror Thothmes III. (B.C.\r\n1600?), represent the return of an expedition from a country called\r\nPunt, which would appear, from the objects brought back, to have been\r\nsomewhere on the East African coast.[8] Much later the Book of Kings (1\r\nKings ix. 26-28; x. 11, 15, 22) tells us that Solomon and Hiram of Tyre\r\nentered into a sort of joint adventure trade from the Red Sea port of\r\nEzion-geber to a country named Ophir, which produced gold. There are\r\nother indications that gold used to come from East Africa, but so far as\r\nwe know it has never been obtained in quantity from any part of the\r\ncoast between Mozambique and Cape Guardafui. Thus there are grounds for\r\nbelieving that a traffic between the Red Sea and the coast south of the\r\nZambesi may have existed from very remote times. Of its later existence\r\nthere is of course no doubt. We know from Arabian sources that in the\r\neighth century an Arab tribe defeated in war established itself on the\r\nAfrican coast south of Cape Guardafui, and that from the ninth century\r\nonward there was a considerable trade between South-east Africa and the\r\nRed Sea ports--a trade which may well have existed long before. And when\r\nthe Portuguese began to explore the coast in 1496 they found Arab\r\nchieftains established at various points along it as far south as\r\nSofala, and found them getting gold from the interior. Three things,\r\ntherefore, are certain--a trade between South-east Africa and the Red\r\nSea, a certain number of Arabs settled along the edge of the ocean, and\r\nan export of gold. Now all over Mashonaland and Matabililand ancient\r\ngold-workings have been observed. Some are quite modern,--one can see\r\nthe wooden supports and the iron tools not yet destroyed by rust,--and\r\nit would seem from the accounts of the natives that the mining went on\r\nto some small extent down to sixty years ago, when the Matabili\r\nconquered the country. Others, however, are, from the appearance of the\r\nground, obviously much more ancient. I have seen some that must have\r\nbeen centuries old, and have been told of others apparently far older,\r\npossibly as old as the buildings at Zimbabwye. I was, moreover, informed\r\nby Mr. Cecil Rhodes (who is keenly interested in African archæology)\r\nthat he had seen on the high plateau of Inyanga, in eastern Mashonaland,\r\nsome remarkable circular pits lined with stone, and approached in each\r\ncase by a narrow subterranean passage, which can best be explained by\r\nsupposing them to have been receptacles for the confinement of slaves\r\noccupied in tilling the soil, as the surrounding country bears mark, in\r\nthe remains of ancient irrigation channels, of an extensive system of\r\ntillage where none now exists. The way in which the stones are laid in\r\nthese pit-walls is quite unlike any modern Kafir work, and points to the\r\npresence of a more advanced race. Putting all these facts together, it\r\nhas been plausibly argued that at some very distant period men more\r\ncivilized than the Kafirs came in search of gold into Mashonaland,\r\nopened these mines, and obtained from them the gold which found its way\r\nto the Red Sea ports, and that the buildings whose ruins we see were\r\ntheir work. How long ago this happened we cannot tell, but if the\r\nstrangers came from Arabia they must have done so earlier than the time\r\nof Mohammed, for there is nothing of an Islamic character about the\r\nruins or the remains found, and it is just as easy to suppose that they\r\ncame in the days of Solomon, fifteen centuries before Mohammed. Nor can\r\nwe guess how they disappeared: whether they were overpowered and\r\nexterminated by the Kafirs, or whether, as Mr. Selous conjectures, they\r\nwere gradually absorbed by the latter, their civilization and religion\r\nperishing, although the practice of mining for gold remained. The\r\noccasional occurrence among the Kafirs of faces with a cast of features\r\napproaching the Semitic has been thought to confirm this notion, though\r\nnobody has as yet suggested that we are to look here for the lost Ten\r\nTribes. Whoever these people were, they have long since vanished. The\r\nnatives seem to have no traditions about the builders of Zimbabwye and\r\nthe other ancient walls, though they regard the ruins with a certain\r\nawe, and fear to approach them at twilight.\r\n\r\nIt is this mystery which makes these buildings, the solitary\r\narchæological curiosities of South Africa, so impressive. The ruins are\r\nnot grand, nor are they beautiful; they are simple even to rudeness. It\r\nis the loneliness of the landscape in which they stand, and still more\r\nthe complete darkness which surrounds their origin, their object, and\r\ntheir history, that gives to them their unique interest. Whence came the\r\nbuilders? What tongue did they speak? What religion did they practise?\r\nDid they vanish imperceptibly away, or did they fly to the coast, or\r\nwere they massacred in a rising of their slaves? We do not know;\r\nprobably we shall never know. We can only say, in the words of the\r\nEastern poet:\r\n\r\n    \"They came like water, and like wind they went.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Mr. Neal, managing director of the Company, has been good\r\nenough to inform me that since my visit he satisfied himself that there\r\nhad been occupations by different races and probably at widely distant\r\ndates. Many skeletons have been found, with a good deal of gold jewelry,\r\nand some bronze implements.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: This place is described by Mr. Selous in his interesting\r\nbook, _A Hunter's Wanderings in Africa_, pp. 339-341. He thinks the wall\r\nas well built as those at the Great Zimbabwye. To me it seemed not so\r\ngood, and a little rougher even than the work at Dhlodhlo. Hard by is a\r\nmodern Kafir fort, Chitikete, with a plastered and loop-holed rough\r\nstone wall, quite unlike this wall at Chipadzi's grave. This place is\r\nfurther described in Chapter XVI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Maspero (_Histoire ancienne des Peuples d'Orient_, p. 169)\r\nconjectures Somaliland]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE KAFIRS: THEIR HISTORY AND INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curtain rises upon the Kafir peoples when the Portuguese landed on\r\nthe east coast of Africa in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Arab\r\nsheiks then held a few of the coast villages, ruling over a mixed race,\r\nnominally Mohammedan, and trading with the Bantu tribes of the interior.\r\nThe vessels of these Arabs crossed the Indian Ocean with the monsoon to\r\nCalicut and the Malabar coast, and the Indian goods they carried back\r\nwere exchanged for the gold and ivory which the natives brought down.\r\nThe principal race that held the country between the Limpopo and the\r\nZambesi was that which the Portuguese called Makalanga or Makaranga, and\r\nwhich we call Makalaka. They are the progenitors of the tribes who, now\r\ngreatly reduced in numbers and divided into small villages and clans,\r\noccupy Mashonaland. Their head chief was called the Monomotapa, a name\r\ninterpreted to mean \"Lord of the Mountain\" or \"Lord of the Mines.\" This\r\npersonage was turned by Portuguese grandiloquence into an emperor, and\r\nby some European geographers into the name of an empire; so Monomotapa\r\ncame to figure on old maps as the designation of a vast territory.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Dutch at the Cape\r\nbegan to learn something of the Kafirs who dwelt to the eastward, they\r\nfound that there was no large dominion, but a great number of petty\r\ntribes, mostly engaged in war with one another. Some were half nomad,\r\nnone was firmly rooted in the soil; and the fact that tribes who spoke\r\nsimilar dialects were often far away from one another, with a tribe of a\r\ndifferent dialect living between, indicated that there had been many\r\ndisplacements of population of which no historical record existed. Early\r\nin the present century events occurred which showed how such\r\ndisplacements might have been brought about. In the last years of the\r\neighteenth century Dingiswayo, the exiled son of the chief of the\r\nAbatetwa tribe, which lived in what is now Zululand, found his way to\r\nthe Cape, and learned to admire the military organization of the British\r\ntroops who were then holding the Colony. Returning home and regaining\r\nhis throne, he began to organise and drill his warriors, who before that\r\ntime had fought without order or discipline, like other savages. His\r\nfavourite officer was Tshaka, a young chief, also exiled, who belonged\r\nto the then small tribe of Zulus. On the death of Dingiswayo, Tshaka was\r\nchosen its chief by the army, and the tribes that had obeyed Dingiswayo\r\nwere thenceforward known under the name of Zulus. Tshaka, who united to\r\nhis intellectual gifts a boundless ambition and a ruthless will, further\r\nimproved the military system of his master, and armed his soldiers with\r\na new weapon, a short, broad-bladed spear, fit for stabbing at close\r\nquarters, instead of the old light javelin which had been theretofore\r\nused. He formed them into regiments, and drilled them to such a\r\nperfection of courage that no enemy could withstand their rush, and the\r\ndefeated force, except such as could escape by fleetness of foot, was\r\nslaughtered on the spot. Quarter had never been given in native wars,\r\nbut the trained valour of the Zulus, and their habit of immediately\r\nengaging the enemy hand to hand, not only gave them an advantage like\r\nthat which suddenly made the Spartan infantry superior to all their\r\nneighbours, but rendered their victories far more sanguinary than native\r\nbattles had previously been Tshaka rapidly subjected or blotted out the\r\nclans that lived near, except the Swazis, a kindred tribe whose\r\ndifficult country gave them some protection. He devastated all the\r\nregion round that of his own subjects, while the flight before his\r\nwarriors of the weaker tribes, each of which fell upon its neighbours\r\nwith the assagai, caused widespread slaughter and ruin all over\r\nSouth-east Africa. Natal became almost a desert, and of the survivors\r\nwho escaped into the mountains, many took to human flesh for want of\r\nother food. To the north of the Vaal River a section of the Zulu army,\r\nwhich had revolted under its general, Mosilikatze, carried slaughter and\r\ndestruction through the surrounding country for hundreds of miles, till\r\nit was itself chased away beyond the Limpopo by the emigrant Boers, as\r\nwill be related in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nTo trace the history of these various native wars would occupy far more\r\nspace than I can spare. I will sum up their general results.\r\n\r\nA new and powerful kingdom, far stronger than any other native monarchy\r\nwe know to have existed before or since, was formed by the Zulus. It\r\nremained powerful under Dingaan (who murdered his half brother Tshaka in\r\n1828), Panda (brother of Tshaka and Dingaan), and Cetewayo (son of\r\nPanda), till 1879, when it was overthrown by the British.\r\n\r\nVarious offshoots from the Zulu nation were scattered out in different\r\ndirections. The Matabili occupied Matabililand in 1838. The Angoni had\r\nbefore that year crossed the Zambesi and settled in Nyassaland, where\r\nthey are still formidable to their native neighbours and troublesome to\r\nthe whites.\r\n\r\nKafir tribes from the north-east were chased southward into the mountain\r\ncountry now called Basutoland, most of which had been previously\r\ninhabited only by Bushmen, and here the Basuto kingdom was built up out\r\nof fugitive clans, by the famous chief Moshesh, between 1820 and 1840.\r\n\r\nSome of the Bechuana tribes were driven from the east into their present\r\nseats in Bechuanaland, some few far north-west to the banks of the\r\nZambesi, where Livingstone found them.\r\n\r\nNot only what is now Natal, but most of what is now the Orange Free\r\nState, with a part of the Transvaal, was almost denuded of inhabitants.\r\nThis had the important consequence of inducing the emigrants from Cape\r\nColony, whose fortunes I shall trace in the following chapter, to move\r\ntoward these regions and establish themselves there.\r\n\r\nThe Gaza tribe, of Zulu race, but revolters from Tshaka, broke away from\r\nthat tyrant, and carried fire and sword among the Tongas and other\r\ntribes living to the west and north-west of Delagoa Bay. In 1833 they\r\ndestroyed the Portuguese garrison there. In 1862 a chief called Mzila\r\nbecame their king, and established his dominion over all the tribes that\r\ndwell on the eastern slope of the Quathlamba Mountains, between the\r\nLimpopo and the Zambesi. He and his son Gungunhana, who in 1896 was\r\nseized and carried off by the Portuguese, were for a time at the head of\r\nthe third great native power in South Africa, the other two being that\r\nof Cetewayo, which perished in 1879, and that of Lo Bengula, overthrown\r\nin 1893. All three chiefs were Zulus in blood. Originally small in\r\nnumber, this race has played by far the greatest part in the annals of\r\nthe native peoples.\r\n\r\nThe career of Tshaka has deserved some description, because it changed\r\nthe face of South Africa in a somewhat similar way, allowing for the\r\ndifference of scale, to that in which the career of Tshaka's\r\ncontemporary, Napoleon Bonaparte, changed the face of Europe. But in\r\n1836, eight years after Tshaka's death, the white man, who had hitherto\r\ncome in contact with the Kafirs only on the Zambesi and at a few points\r\non the south-eastern and southern coast, began that march into the\r\ninterior which has now brought him to the shores of Lake Tanganyika.\r\nThenceforward the wars of the natives among themselves cease to be\r\nimportant. It is their strife with the European conqueror that is of\r\nconsequence, and the narrative of that strife belongs to the history of\r\nthe European colonies and republics, which will be given in the two\r\nsucceeding chapters. This, however, seems the right place for some\r\nremarks on the government and customs of the Kafir tribes, intended to\r\nexplain the conditions under which these tribes have met and attempted\r\nto resist the white strangers who have now become their rulers.\r\n\r\nThe Kafirs were savages, yet not of a low type, for they tilled the\r\nsoil, could work in metals, spoke a highly developed language, and had a\r\nsort of customary law. The south-east coast tribes, Zulus, Pondos,\r\nTembus, Kosas, inhabiting a fairly well-watered and fertile country,\r\nwere, as a rule, the strongest men and the fiercest fighters; but the\r\ntribes of the interior were not inferior in intellect, and sometimes\r\nsuperior in the arts. Lower in every respect were the west-coast tribes.\r\nThey dwelt in a poor and almost waterless land, and their blood was\r\nmixed with that of Hottentots and Bushmen. In every race the\r\norganization was by families, clans, and tribes, the tribe consisting of\r\na number of clans or smaller groups, having at its head one supreme\r\nchief, belonging to a family whose lineage was respected. The power of\r\nthe chief was, however, not everywhere the same. Among the Zulus, whose\r\norganization was entirely military, he was a despot whose word was law.\r\nAmong the Bechuana tribes, and their kinsfolk the Basutos, he was\r\nobliged to defer to the sentiment of the people, which (in some tribes)\r\nfound expression in a public meeting where every freeman had a right to\r\nspeak and might differ from the chief.[9] Even such able men as the\r\nBasuto Moshesh and the Bechuana Khama had often to bend to the wish of\r\ntheir subjects, and a further check existed in the tendency to move away\r\nfrom a harsh and unpopular chief and place one's self under the\r\nprotection of some more tactful ruler. Everywhere, of course, the old\r\ncustoms had great power, and the influence of the old men who were most\r\nconversant with them was considerable. The chief of the whole tribe did\r\nnot interfere much with affairs outside his own particular clan, and was\r\na more important figure in war-time than during peace. Aided by a\r\ncouncil of his leading men, each chief administered justice and settled\r\ndisputes; and it was his function to allot land to those who asked for a\r\nfield to till, the land itself belonging to the tribe as a whole. The\r\nchiefs act gave a title to the piece allotted so long as it was\r\ncultivated, for public opinion resented any arbitrary eviction; but\r\npasture-land was open to all the cattle of the clansmen. It was in\r\ncattle that the wealth of a chief or a rich man lay, and cattle, being\r\nthe common measure of value, served as currency, as they serve still\r\namong the more remote tribes which have not learned to use British coin.\r\nPolygamy was practised by all who could afford it, the wife being\r\npurchased from her father with cattle, more or fewer according to her\r\nrank. This practice, called _lobola_, still prevails universally, and\r\nhas caused much perplexity to the missionaries. Its evil effects are\r\nobvious, but it is closely intertwined with the whole system of native\r\nsociety. A chief had usually a head wife, belonging to some important\r\nhouse, and her sons were preferred in succession to those of the\r\ninferior wives. In some tribes the chief, like a Turkish sultan, had no\r\nregular wife, but only concubines. Among the coast tribes no one, except\r\na chief, was suffered to marry any one of kin to him. There was great\r\npride of birth among the head chiefs, and their genealogies have in not\r\na few cases been carefully kept for seven or eight generations.\r\n\r\nSlavery existed among some of the tribes of the interior, and the\r\nordinary wife was everywhere little better than a slave, being required\r\nto do nearly all the tillage and most of the other work, except that\r\nabout the cattle, which, being more honourable, was performed by men.\r\nThe male Kafir is a lazy fellow who likes talking and sleeping better\r\nthan continuous physical exertion, and the difficulty of inducing him to\r\nwork is the chief difficulty which European mine-owners in South Africa\r\ncomplain of. Like most men in his state of civilization, he is fond of\r\nhunting, even in its lowest forms, and of fighting. Both of these\r\npleasures are being withdrawn from him, the former by the extinction of\r\nthe game, the latter by the British Government; but it will be long\r\nbefore he acquires the habits of steady and patient industry which have\r\nbecome part of the character of the inhabitants of India.\r\n\r\nWar was the natural state of the tribes toward one another, just as it\r\nwas among the Red Indians and the primitive Celts, and indeed generally\r\neverywhere in the early days of Europe. Their weapons were the spear or\r\nassagai, and a sort of wooden club, occasionally a crescent-shaped\r\nbattle-axe, and still less frequently the bow. Horses were unknown, for\r\nthe ox, sheep, goat and dog were over all South Africa the only\r\ndomesticated quadrupeds. One tribe, however, the Basutos, now breeds\r\nhorses extensively, and has turned them to account in fighting. The\r\nrapid movement of their mounted warriors was one of the chief\r\ndifficulties the colonial forces had to deal with in the last Basuto\r\nwar. The courage in war which distinguished the tribes of Zulu and Kosa\r\nrace was all the more creditable because it had not, like that of the\r\nMohammedan dervishes of the Sudan, or of Mohammedans anywhere engaged in\r\na _jehad_, a religious motive and the promise of future bliss behind it.\r\nThe British army has encountered no more daring or formidable enemies.\r\nNine wars were needed to subjugate the Kafirs of the southern coast,\r\nalthough till recently they had few firearms. But the natives had no\r\nidea of the tactics needed in facing a civilized foe. As in their\r\nbattles with the Boers they were destroyed by the fire of horsemen\r\nriding up, delivering a volley, and riding off before an assagai could\r\nreach them, so in the great war with Cetewayo in 1879 they fought in the\r\nopen and were mowed down by British volleys; and in 1893 the Matabili\r\nperished in the same way under the fire of riflemen and Maxim guns\r\nsheltered behind a laager of wagons.\r\n\r\nReligion was a powerful factor in Kafir life; but religion did not mean\r\nthe worship of any deity, for there was no deity. Still less had it any\r\nmoral significance. To the Kafirs, as to most savage races, the world\r\nwas full of spirits--spirits of the rivers, the mountains, and the\r\nwoods. Most important were the ghosts of the dead, who had power to\r\ninjure or to help the living, and who were therefore propitiated by\r\nofferings at stated periods, as well as on occasions when their aid was\r\nspecially desired. This kind of worship, the worship once most generally\r\ndiffused throughout the world, and which held its ground among the\r\nGreeks and Italians in the most flourishing period of ancient\r\ncivilization, as it does in China and Japan to-day, was and is virtually\r\nthe religion of the Kafirs. It was chiefly rendered to the ghosts of the\r\nchiefs, who retained in the spirit world the exceptional importance they\r\nhad held among the living; and it had much weight in maintaining loyalty\r\nto a chief, because revolt against him was an insult to a powerful set\r\nof ghosts. The ghost dwelt at the spot where the body was buried, and it\r\nwas therefore at the grave that the offerings, mostly of cakes and Kafir\r\nbeer, were made. Occasionally animals were killed, not so much by way of\r\nsacrifice as for the sake of providing the ghost with a specially\r\nprecious kind of food, though the two ideas run close together in most\r\nprimitive worships.[10] Among the Matabili, for instance, there was once\r\na year a great feast in honour of the king's ancestors, who were\r\nsupposed to come and join in the mirth. It was also to the grave that\r\nthose who wished to call up the ghost by spells went to effect their\r\nnefarious purpose, and the real place of interment of a great chief was\r\nfor this reason sometimes concealed, I found at Thaba Bosiyo, the famous\r\nstronghold of the Basuto chief Moshesh, that his body had been secretly\r\nremoved from the place where he was buried to baffle the wizards, who\r\nmight try to use his ghost against the living. The ghost is, of course,\r\napt to be spiteful, that of an uncle (I was told) particularly so; and\r\nif he is neglected he is extremely likely to bring some evil on the\r\nfamily or tribe. Sometimes the spirit of an ancestor passes into an\r\nanimal, and by preference into that of a snake, not that it lives in the\r\nsnake, but that it assumes this form when it wishes to visit men. A\r\nparticular kind of green snake is revered by the Matabili for this\r\nreason. And most, if not all, tribes had an animal which they deemed to\r\nbe of kin to them, and which they called their \"_siboko_,\" a term\r\napparently corresponding to the totem of the North American Indians.\r\nCreatures of this species they never killed, and some tribes took their\r\nname from it. Thus the Ba-Taung are the people of the lion; the\r\nBa-Mangwato have the duyker antelope for their totem; and in the Basuto\r\n_pitso_ (public meeting) an orator will begin by addressing his audience\r\nas \"sons of the crocodile.\" Of human sacrifices there seems to be no\r\ntrace. Men were killed for all possible reasons, but never as offerings.\r\nAnd, indeed, to have so killed them would have been to treat the ghosts\r\nas cannibals, a view foreign to native habits, for though human flesh\r\nhas been resorted to in times of severe famine, it has never been\r\nregularly eaten, and the use of it excites disgust.\r\n\r\nWhether the Kafirs had any idea of a supreme being is a question which\r\nhas been much discussed. In several tribes the word, differently spelled\r\n\"Umlimo\" or \"Mlimo\" or \"Molimo\" (said to mean \"hidden\" or \"unseen\"), is\r\nused to denote either a power apparently different from that of the\r\nnature sprites or ghosts of the dead, or else the prophet or soothsayer\r\nwho delivers messages or oracles supposed to emanate from this power.\r\nThe missionaries have in their native versions of the Bible used the\r\nterm to translate the word \"God.\" Sometimes, among the Tongas at least,\r\nthe word _tilo_ (sky) is used to describe a mysterious force; as, for\r\ninstance, when a man dies without any apparent malady, he is said to be\r\nkilled by the _tilo_.[11] On the whole, after many inquiries from\r\nmissionaries and others who know the natives well, I was led to the\r\nconclusion that the Kafirs have a vague notion of some power\r\ntranscending that of common ghosts, and able to affect the operations of\r\nnature (as, for instance, to send rain), but far too dimly conceived to\r\nbe properly describable as a divine being.[12] Or to put the thing in\r\nother words, the ordinary and familiar nature-sprites and ghosts of the\r\ndeparted do not exhaust the possibilities of super-human agency; for\r\nthere remains, as among the Athenians whose altar St. Paul found (Acts\r\nxvii. 23), an \"Unknown God,\" or rather unknown power, probably\r\nassociated with the heavens above, whose interference may produce\r\nresults not attainable through inferior spiritual agencies. One of the\r\ndifficulties in reaching any knowledge of the real belief of the people\r\nis that they are usually examined by leading questions, and are apt to\r\nreply affirmatively to whatever the querist puts to them. Their thoughts\r\non these dark subjects are either extremely vague and misty or extremely\r\nmaterial; the world of abstract thought, in which European minds have\r\nlearned to move with an ease and confidence produced by the possession\r\nof a whole arsenal of theological and metaphysical phrases, being to\r\nthem an undiscovered country.\r\n\r\nSince there were no deities and no idols, there were no priests; but the\r\nwant of a priesthood was fully compensated by the presence of wizards;\r\nfor among the Kafirs, as among other primitive peoples, there was and is\r\nan absolute belief in the power of spells, and of sorcery generally.\r\nThese wizards, like the medicine men among the Red Indians, were an\r\nimportant class, second only to the chiefs. They were not a caste,\r\nthough very often the son of a wizard would be brought up to the\r\nprofession. The practitioners were on the lookout for promising boys,\r\nand would take and train one to witchcraft, imparting their secrets,\r\nwhich included a remarkable knowledge of the properties of various\r\nplants available for poison or healing. Sometimes the wizard acted as a\r\nphysician; sometimes he would attempt to make rain; sometimes he would\r\nprofess to deliver messages from the unseen world, and in these cases he\r\nmight become a terrible power for mischief. Such a revelation made to\r\nthe Kosa clans on the south coast in 1856-57, directing them to kill\r\ntheir cattle and destroy their grain, because the ghosts of their\r\nancestors were coming to drive out the whites, led to the death by\r\nfamine of more than 30,000 people. Such a revelation proceeding from a\r\nsoothsayer, occasionally called the Mlimo, who dwelt in a cavern among\r\ngranite rocks in the Matoppo Hills at a place called Matojeni,\r\nsouth-east of Bulawayo[13] (oracles have always tended to come from\r\ncaves), had much to do with the rising of the Matabili in 1896. But the\r\nmost frequent and most formidable work done by the wizard was that of\r\n\"smelling out\" persons who were bewitching others so as to cause\r\nsickness or misfortune. In this branch of his profession the wizard\r\noften became the engine of the jealousy or rapacity of the chief, who\r\nwould secretly prompt him to denounce a prominent or a wealthy man.\r\nSuspicion being once roused, the victim had little chance: he was\r\ndespatched, and his property seized by the chief. Witchcraft, and the\r\nmurders it gave rise to, have been the darkest side of native life. The\r\nsorcerer has usually been the enemy of the missionary, who threatens his\r\ngains; but his power is now generally declining, and the British\r\nGovernment forbids the practice of smelling out witches, as well as many\r\nother shocking and disgusting rites which used to accompany the\r\nadmission of boys and girls to the status of adults, or were practised\r\nat sundry festivals. Of the faith in minor and harmless spells one finds\r\ninstances everywhere. In Matabililand, for instance, a boy was pointed\r\nout to me who had just been occupied in putting a charm into the\r\nfootprint of a lion, in order to prevent the unwelcome visitor from\r\nreturning; and nearly every native wears some kind of amulet.[14] These\r\nbeliefs will take a long time to die, but the missionaries have now\r\nusually the good sense to see that they do little harm.\r\n\r\nAs their religious customs were rather less sanguinary than those of the\r\nGuinea Coast negroes, so the Kafirs themselves were, when the whites\r\nfirst saw them, somewhat more advanced in civilization. Compared with\r\nthe Red Indians of America, they stood at a point lower than that of the\r\nIroquois or Cherokees, but superior to the Utes or to the Diggers of the\r\nPacific coast. They could work in iron and copper, and had some notions\r\nof ornament. Their music is rude, but not wholly devoid of melody, and\r\nthey use instruments of stone, wood, and iron, by striking which a kind\r\nof tune can be played. Some tribes, such as the Tongas, have good\r\nvoices, and a marked taste for music. They have some simple games, and a\r\nfolk-lore which consists chiefly in animal tales, resembling those\r\ncollected by Mr. Harris in his _Uncle Remus_, save that the hare plays\r\namong the Bantu peoples the part of Br'er Rabbit.[15] To poetry, even in\r\nits most rudimentary forms, they do not seem to have attained. Yet they\r\nare by no means wanting in intelligence, and have, with less gaiety,\r\nmore sense of dignity and more persistence in their purposes than the\r\nGuinea negro.\r\n\r\nWhen the Portuguese and Dutch first knew the Kafirs, they did not appear\r\nto be making any progress toward a higher culture. Human life was held\r\nvery cheap; women were in a degraded state, and sexual morality at a low\r\nebb. Courage, loyalty to chief and tribe, and hospitality were the three\r\nprominent virtues. War was the only pursuit in which chieftains sought\r\ndistinction, and war was mere slaughter and devastation, unaccompanied\r\nby any views of policy or plans of administration. The people were--and\r\nindeed still are--passionately attached to their old customs, which\r\neven a king rarely ventured to disturb (though Tshaka is said to have\r\nabolished among his subjects the rite of circumcision, which is\r\ngenerally practised by the Kafirs); and it was probably as much the\r\nunwillingness to have their customs disturbed as the apprehension for\r\ntheir land that made many of the tribes oppose to the advance of the\r\nEuropeans so obstinate a resistance. Though they feared the firearms of\r\nthe whites, whom they called wizards, it was a long time before they\r\nrealized their hopeless inferiority, and the impossibility of prevailing\r\nin war. Their minds were mostly too childish to recollect and draw the\r\nnecessary inferences from previous defeats, and they never realized that\r\nthe whites possessed beyond the sea an inexhaustible reservoir of men\r\nand weapons. Even the visit of Lo Bengula's envoys to England in 1891,\r\nwhen they were shown all the wonders of London, in order that through\r\nthem the Matabili nation might be deterred from an attack on the whites,\r\nfailed to produce any effect upon the minds of the young warriors, who\r\nwere fully persuaded that they could destroy the few strangers in their\r\ncountry as easily as they had overthrown the Mashonas. The only chiefs\r\nwho seem to have fully grasped the relative strength of the Europeans,\r\nand thus to have formed schemes of policy suitable to their inferior\r\nposition, were Moshesh, who profited by the advice of the French\r\nmissionaries, and Khama, who was himself a Christian and the pupil of\r\nmissionaries. Nor did any chief ever rise to the conception of forming a\r\nleague of blacks against whites.\r\n\r\nThe natives, as we shall see, have had harsh treatment from the\r\nEuropeans. Many unjust things, many cruel things, many things which\r\nwould excite horror if practised in European warfare, have been done\r\nagainst them. But whoever tries to strike the balance of good and evil\r\ndue to the coming of the whites must remember what the condition of the\r\ncountry was before the whites came. As between the different tribes\r\nthere was neither justice nor pity, but simply the rule of the\r\nstrongest, unmitigated by any feeling of religion or morality. In war\r\nnon-combatants as well as combatants were ruthlessly slaughtered, or\r\nreserved only for slavery; and war was the normal state of things.\r\nWithin each tribe a measure of peace and order was maintained. But the\r\nweak had a hard time, and those who were rich, or had roused the enmity\r\nof some powerful man, were at any moment liable to perish on the charge\r\nof witchcraft. In some tribes, such as the Matabili, incessant slaughter\r\nwent on by the orders of the king. Nothing less than the prolific\r\nquality of the race could have kept South Africa well peopled in the\r\nteeth of such a waste of life as war and murder caused.\r\n\r\nOf the character of the individual native as it affects his present\r\nrelations with the whites and the probable future of the race, I shall\r\nhave to speak in a later chapter (Chapter XXI), as also of the condition\r\nand prospects of the Christian missions which exist among them, and\r\nwhich form the main civilizing influence now at work.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See further as to this primary assembly the remarks on the\r\nBasuto _Pitso_ in Chapter XX.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Those who are curious on this subject may consult Mr.\r\nFrazer's _Golden Bough_, and the late Mr. Robertson Smith's _Religion of\r\nthe Semites_, where many interesting and profoundly suggestive facts\r\nregarding it are collected.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: As in Homer's day sudden deaths were attributed to the\r\narrows of Apollo or Artemis.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: M.

And I was informed that the Basutos will\r\npray to the \"lesser Molimos,\" the ghost of their ancestors, to ask the\r\ngreat Molimo to send rain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: This Mlimo--whether the name is properly applicable to the\r\ndivinity, whatever it was, or to the prophet, seems doubtful--belonged\r\nto the Makalakas, but was revered by the Matabili, who conquered them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: It need hardly be said that they have a full belief in the\r\npower of certain men to assume the forms of beasts.

South Africa has had a\r\ngreat deal of history, especially in the present century, and there are\r\nfew places in which recollections of the past are more powerful factors\r\nin the troubles of the present. In the short sketch I propose to give I\r\nshall advert only to the chief events, and particularly to those whose\r\nimportance is still felt and which have done most to determine the\r\nrelations of the European races to one another. The constitutional and\r\nparliamentary history of the two British colonies and the two Boer\r\nrepublics has been short and not specially interesting. The military\r\nhistory has been on a small scale. The economic and industrial history\r\nhas been simple and remarkable only so far as the mines are concerned.\r\nBut the history of the dealings of the white races with one another and\r\nwith the blacks is both peculiar and instructive, and well deserves a\r\nfuller narrative and more elaborate treatment than I have space to give.\r\n\r\nFour European races have occupied the country. Of those, however, who\r\ncame with Vasco da Gama from Lisbon in 1497 we shall have little to say,\r\nand of the handful who followed Herr Lüderitz from Bremen in 1883 still\r\nless. The interest of the tale lies in the struggles of two branches of\r\nthe same Low-German stock, the Dutch and the English.\r\n\r\nThe first to appear on the scene were the men of Portugal, then in the\r\nfresh springtime of its power and with what seemed a splendid career of\r\ndiscovery and conquest opening before it.[16] Bartholomew Diaz, whose\r\nrenown has been unjustly obscured by that of Vasco da Gama, discovered\r\nthe Cape of Storms, as he called it,--the name of Good Hope was given by\r\nKing John II.,--in 1486, and explored the coast as far as the mouth of\r\nthe Great Fish River. In 1497-98 Da Gama, on his famous voyage to India,\r\nfollowed the southern and eastern coast to Melinda; and in 1502, on his\r\nsecond voyage, after touching at Delagoa Bay, he visited Sofala, which\r\nwas then the port to which most of the gold and ivory came from the\r\ninterior. Here he found Arabs established in the town, as they were in\r\nother maritime trading places all the way north to Mombasa. At what date\r\nthey first settled there is unknown; probably they had traded along the\r\ncoast from times long before Mohammed. They were superior to the native\r\nblacks, though mixed in blood, but of course far inferior to the\r\nPortuguese, who overthrew their power. In 1505 the Portuguese built a\r\nfort at Sofala, and from there and several other points along the coast\r\nprosecuted their trade with the inland regions, using the conquered\r\nArabs as their agents. For a century they remained the sole masters not\r\nonly of the South-east African seaboard, but of the Indian Ocean, no\r\nvessel of any other European country appearing to dispute their\r\npre-eminence. They might, had they cared, have occupied and appropriated\r\nthe whole southern half of the continent; but in the sixteenth century\r\nit was not of colonization, nor even so much of conquest, that monarchs,\r\ngovernors, and navigators thought, but of gold. Portugal had no surplus\r\npopulation to spare for settling her new territories, and--not to speak\r\nof Brazil--she had a far richer trade to develop in western India than\r\nanything which Africa could offer. It may now excite surprise that she\r\nshould have taken no step to claim the long stretch of country whose\r\nshores her sailors had explored, from the mouth of the Orange River on\r\nthe west to that of the Limpopo on the east. But there was no gold to be\r\nhad there, and a chance skirmish with the Hottentots in Table Bay, in\r\nwhich the viceroy D'Almeida, returning from India, was killed in 1510,\r\ngave them a false notion of the danger to be feared from that people,\r\nwho were in reality one of the weakest and least formidable among\r\nAfrican races.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Portuguese, who might have possessed themselves of the\r\ntemperate and healthy regions which we now call Cape Colony and Natal,\r\nconfined their settlements to the malarious country north of the tropic\r\nof Capricorn. Here they made two or three attempts, chiefly by moving up\r\nthe valley of the Zambesi, to conquer the native tribes, or to support\r\nagainst his neighbours some chieftain who was to become their vassal.\r\nTheir numbers were, however, too small, and they were too feebly\r\nsupported from home, to enable them to secure success. When they\r\ndesisted from these attempts, their missionaries, chiefly Dominican\r\nfriars, though some Jesuits were also engaged in the work, maintained an\r\nactive propaganda among the tribes, and at one time counted their\r\nconverts by thousands. Not only missionaries, but small trading parties,\r\npenetrated the mysterious interior; and one or two light cannons, as\r\nwell as articles which must have come to Africa from India, such as\r\nfragments of Indian and Chinese pottery, have been found many hundred\r\nmiles from the sea.[17]\r\n\r\nBut on the whole the Portuguese exerted very little permanent influence\r\non the country and its inhabitants. The missions died out, most of the\r\nforts crumbled away or were abandoned, and all idea of further conquest\r\nhad been dropped before the end of last century. There were, indeed, two\r\nfatal obstacles to conquering or civilising work. One was the extreme\r\nunhealthiness both of the flat country which lies between the sea and\r\nthe edge of the great interior plateau, and of the whole Zambesi Valley,\r\nup which most of the attempts at an advance had been made. Fever not\r\nonly decimated the expeditions and the garrisons of the forts, but\r\nenervated the main body of settlers who remained on the coast, soon\r\nreducing whatever enterprise or vigour they had brought from Europe. The\r\nother was the tendency of the Portuguese to mingle their blood with that\r\nof the natives. Very few women were brought out from home, so that a\r\nmixed race soon sprang up, calling themselves Portuguese, but much\r\ninferior to the natives of Portugal. The Portuguese, even more than the\r\nSpaniards, have shown both in Brazil and in Africa comparatively little\r\nof that racial contempt for the blacks, and that aversion to intimate\r\nsocial relations with them, which have been so characteristic of the\r\nDutch and the English. There have, of course, been a good many mulattos\r\nborn of Dutch fathers in Africa, as of Anglo-American fathers in the\r\nWest Indies and in the former slave States of North America. But the\r\nDutch or English mulatto was almost always treated as belonging to the\r\nblack race, and entirely below the level of the meanest white, whereas\r\namong the Portuguese a strong infusion of black blood did not\r\nnecessarily carry with it social disparity.[18]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the seventeenth century the Dutch, prosecuting their\r\nwar against the Spanish monarchy, which had acquired the crown of\r\nPortugal in 1581 and held it till 1640, attacked the Portuguese forts on\r\nthe East African coast, but after a few years abandoned an enterprise in\r\nwhich there was little to gain, and devoted their efforts to the more\r\nprofitable field of the East Indies. With this exception, no European\r\npower troubled the Portuguese in Africa. They had, however, frequent\r\nconflicts with the natives, and in 1834 were driven from their fort at\r\nInhambane, between Sofala and Delagoa Bay, and in 1836 from Sofala\r\nitself, which, however, they subsequently recovered. It was not till the\r\nprogress of inland discovery, and especially the establishment of a Boer\r\nrepublic in the Transvaal had made the coast seem valuable, that two new\r\nand formidable rivals appeared on the scene.\r\n\r\nUnder the combined operation of these causes such power as Portugal\r\npossessed on this coast declined during the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies. Except on the deadly banks of the Zambesi, she never had a\r\npermanent settlement more than fifty miles from the sea, and very few so\r\nfar inland. The population that spoke Portuguese and professed\r\nChristianity did not exceed a few thousands, and of these the large\r\nmajority were at least half Kafir in blood. It became plain that such\r\nlife and force as the nation once possessed had, at any rate in Africa,\r\ndied out, and that if ever the continent was to be developed it would\r\nnot be by the race that had first explored it. Here, therefore, we may\r\nleave the eastern coast and the feeble settlers who shivered with ague\r\nin its swamps, and turn our eyes to the far south, where a new and more\r\nvigorous race began, a century and a half after the time of Vasco da\r\nGama, to lay the foundations of a new dominion.\r\n\r\nThe first Teutonic people that entered the African continent were the\r\nVandals in the fifth century. They came across the Straits of Gibraltar\r\nas conquerors, but they soon established a powerful fleet and acquired a\r\nmaritime empire in the western Mediterranean. The second band of Teutons\r\nto enter were the Dutch. They were already a sea power active in the far\r\nEast, whither they had been led by their war with Spain. But it was not\r\nas conquerors that they came, nor even as settlers intending to build up\r\na colonial community. They came to establish a place of call for their\r\nvessels trading to India, where fresh water and vegetables might be\r\nobtained for their crews, who suffered terribly from scurvy on the\r\nvoyage of six months or more from the Netherlands to the ports of\r\nFarther India. From the early years of the seventeenth century both\r\nDutch and English vessels had been in the habit of putting in to Table\r\nBay to refit and get fresh water. Indeed, in 1620 two English commanders\r\nhad landed there and proclaimed the sovereignty of King James I, though\r\ntheir action was not ratified either by the king or by the English East\r\nIndia Company. In 1648 a shipwrecked Dutch crew spent six months in\r\nTable Valley, behind the spot where Cape Town now stands, and having\r\nsome seeds with them, planted vegetables and got a good crop. They\r\nrepresented on their return to Holland the advantages of the spot, and\r\nin 1652 three vessels despatched by the Dutch East India Company\r\ndisembarked a body of settlers, under the command of Jan van Riebeek,\r\nwho were directed to build a fort and hospital, and, above all, to raise\r\nvegetables and obtain from the Hottentots supplies of fresh meat for\r\npassing ships. It is from these small beginnings of a kitchen-garden\r\nthat Dutch and British dominion in South Africa has grown up.\r\n\r\nThe history of this Dutch settlement presents a singular contrast to\r\nthat of the Portuguese. During the first quarter of a century the few\r\nsettlers kept themselves within the narrow limits of the Cape peninsula.\r\nIn 1680 an outlying agricultural community was planted at Stellenbosch,\r\ntwenty-five miles from Cape Town, but not till the end of the century\r\nwas the first range of mountains crossed. Meantime the population began\r\nto grow. In 1658 the first slaves were introduced,--West African\r\nnegroes,--a deplorable step, which has had the result of making the\r\nSouth African whites averse to open-air manual work and of practically\r\ncondemning South Africa to be a country of black labour. Shortly\r\nafterwards the Company began to bring in Asiatic convicts, mostly\r\nMohammedan Malays, from its territories in the East Indian Archipelago.\r\nThese men intermarried with the female slaves, and to a less extent with\r\nHottentot women, and from them a mixed coloured race has sprung up,\r\nwhich forms a large part of the population of Cape Town and the\r\nneighbouring districts. The influx of these inferior elements was\r\nbalanced by the arrival in 1689 of about three hundred French Huguenots,\r\na part of those who had taken refuge in Holland after the revocation of\r\nthe Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV. They were persons of a high stamp,\r\nmore intelligent and educated than most of the previous settlers had\r\nbeen, and they brought with them a strong attachment to their Protestant\r\nfaith and a love of liberty. From them many of the best colonial\r\nfamilies are sprung. At first they clung to their language, and sought\r\nto form a distinct religious community; but they were ultimately\r\ncompelled to join the Dutch Reformed Church, and the use of French was\r\nforbidden in official documents or religious services. Before the middle\r\nof the eighteenth century that language had disappeared, and the\r\nnewcomers had practically amalgamated with their Dutch neighbours. The\r\nCompany's government was impartially intolerant, and did not until 1780\r\npermit the establishment of a Lutheran church, although many German\r\nLutherans had settled in the country.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when the settlers began to spread out from the coast into\r\nthe dry lands of the interior a great change came upon them, and what we\r\nnow call the distinctive South African type of character and habits\r\nbegan to appear. The first immigrants were not, like some of the English\r\nsettlers in Virginia, men of good social position in their own country,\r\nattached to it by many ties, nor, like the English settlers in the New\r\nEngland colonies, men of good education and serious temper, seeking the\r\nfreedom to worship God in their own way. They came from the humbler\r\nclasses, and partly because they had few home ties, partly because the\r\nvoyage to Holland was so long that communication with it was difficult,\r\nthey maintained little connection with the mother country and soon lost\r\ntheir feeling for it. The Huguenot immigrants were more cultivated, and\r\nsocially superior to the rude adventurers who had formed the bulk of the\r\nDutch settlers, but they had of course no home country to look to.\r\nFrance had cast them out; Holland was alien in blood and speech. So it\r\nbefell that of all the colonists that Europe had sent forth since the\r\nvoyage of Columbus, the South African whites were those who soonest lost\r\ntheir bond with Europe, and were the first set of emigrants to feel\r\nthemselves a new people, whose true home lay in the new land they had\r\nadopted. Thus early in South African annals were the foundations laid of\r\nwhat we now call the Africander sentiment--a sentiment which has become\r\none of the main factors in the history of the country.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. When the comparatively small area of fertile land\r\nwhich could be cultivated without irrigation had been taken up, the\r\nkeeping of cattle suggested itself as an easy means of livelihood. The\r\npasture, however, was so thin that it was necessary to graze the cattle\r\nover wide stretches of ground, and the farther they went into the\r\ninterior the scantier was the pasture and the larger therefore did the\r\narea of land become over which a farmer let his oxen or sheep run. This\r\nprocess of extending cattle-farms--if farms they can be called--over the\r\ninterior was materially accelerated through the destruction of the\r\nnearer Hottentot tribes by the frightful outbreak of smallpox which\r\nbegun in A.D. 1713, followed by another not less virulent in 1755. The\r\nEuropeans suffered severely from it, the negroes, slave and free, still\r\nmore, but the Hottentots most of all. In fact, it cleared them away from\r\nall the southern and western parts of the Colony and left these regions\r\nopen to Europeans. Only the Bushmen remained, whose more solitary life\r\ngave them comparative immunity from contagion. Thus from the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century, and during the whole of it, there was a\r\nconstant dispersion of settlers from the old nucleus into the\r\ncircumjacent wilderness. They were required to pay a sum amounting to\r\nfive pounds a year for the use of three thousand _morgen_ (a little more\r\nthan six thousand acres) of grazing ground, and were accustomed at\r\ncertain seasons to drive their herds up into the deserts of the Karroo\r\nfor a change of feed, just after the time when the summer rains\r\nstimulate the scrubby vegetation of that desert region. These settlers\r\nled a lonely and almost nomadic life. Much of their time was passed in\r\ntheir tent-waggons, in which, with their wives and children, they\r\nfollowed the cattle from spot to spot where the pasture was best. They\r\nbecame excellent marksmen and expert in the pursuit of wild beasts. Some\r\nmade a living by elephant-hunting in the wilderness, and those who\r\ntended cattle learned to face the lion. They were much molested by the\r\nBushmen, whose stealthy attacks and poisoned arrows made them dangerous\r\nenemies, and they carried on with the latter a constant war, in which no\r\nquarter was given. Thus there developed among them that courage,\r\nself-reliance, and passion for independence which are characteristic of\r\nthe frontiersman everywhere, coupled with a love of solitude and\r\nisolation which the conditions of western America did not produce. For\r\nin western America the numbers and ferocity of the Red Indians, and\r\nthose resources of the land which encouraged the formation of\r\nagricultural and timber-producing communities, made villages follow the\r\nmarch of discovery and conquest, while in pastoral Africa villages were\r\nfew and extremely small. Isolation and the wild life these ranchmen led\r\nsoon told upon their habits. The children grew up ignorant; the women,\r\nas was natural where slaves were employed, lost the neat and cleanly\r\nways of their Dutch ancestors; the men were rude, bigoted, indifferent\r\nto the comforts and graces of life. But they retained their religious\r\nearnestness, carrying their Bibles and the practice of daily family\r\nworship with them in their wanderings; and they retained also a passion\r\nfor freedom which the government vainly endeavoured to restrain. Though\r\nmagistrates, called _landdrosts_, were placed in a few of the outlying\r\nstations, with assessors taken from the people, called _heemraden_, to\r\nassist them in administering justice, it was found impossible to\r\nmaintain control over the wandering cattle-men, who from their habit of\r\n\"trekking\" from place to place were called Trek Boers.[19] The only\r\norganization that brought them together was that which their ceaseless\r\nstrife with the Bushmen enjoined. Being all accustomed to the use of\r\narms, they formed war-parties, which from time to time attacked and\r\nrooted out the Bushmen from a disturbed area; and the government\r\nrecognized these military needs and methods by appointing\r\nfield-commandants to each district, and subordinate officers, called\r\nfield-cornets, to each sub-district. These functionaries have become the\r\nbasis of the system of local government among the South African Dutch,\r\nand the war-bands, called commandos, have played a great part in the\r\nsubsequent military history of the country.\r\n\r\nThe eastward progress of expansion presently brought the settlers into\r\ncontact with more formidable foes in the Bantu tribes, who dwelt beyond\r\nthe Great Fish River. In 1779 some Kafir clans of the Kosa race crossed\r\nthat river and drove off the cattle off the farmers to the west of it,\r\nand a war, the first of many fiercely fought Kafir wars, followed, which\r\nended in the victory of the colonists.\r\n\r\nAll this while the Colony had been ruled by the Dutch East India Company\r\nthrough a governor and council, appointed by the directors in Holland,\r\nand responsible to them only--a system roughly similar to that which the\r\nEnglish established in India during the eighteenth century. The\r\nadministration was better or worse according to the character and\r\ncapacity of the governor for the time being, but it was on the whole\r\nunpopular with the colonists, not merely because they were excluded from\r\nall share in it (except to some small extent in the courts of justice),\r\nbut also because the Company kept in its own hands a monopoly of the\r\ntrade, and managed trade with a view to its own commercial interests\r\nrather than to those of the community. Thus discontent grew, and this\r\ndiscontent was one of the causes which led to the dispersion of the\r\npeople into the wilderness, whose remoteness secured to them a practical\r\nfreedom. In 1779 disaffection had been so much stimulated by the\r\nmaladministration of a weak governor, and by the news of the revolt of\r\nthe American colonies against Great Britain, that delegates were sent to\r\nHolland to demand redress for their commercial and other grievances, as\r\nwell as a share in the government of the Colony. The Company was by this\r\ntime in financial straits, and less powerful with the States-general of\r\nthe Netherlands than it had formerly been. Long negotiations followed,\r\nreforms were promised, and at last, in 1792, two commissioners were sent\r\nout to investigate and frame measures of reform. The measures they\r\npromulgated were, however, deemed inadequate by the more ardent spirits,\r\nand by those especially who dwelt in the outlying districts, where the\r\ngovernment had exerted, and could exert, little control. In 1795, first\r\nat Graaf-Reinet and then at Swellendam, the people rose in revolt, not,\r\nas they stated, against the mother country, but against the Company.\r\nThey turned out the landdrosts, and set up miniature republics, each\r\nwith a representative assembly.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been difficult for the government to have reduced\r\nthese risings by cutting off supplies of food. But now South Africa was\r\nsuddenly swept into the great whirlpool of European politics, and events\r\nwere at hand which made these petty local movements insignificant, save\r\nin so far as they were evidences of the independent spirit of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nFrom 1757, when the battle of Plassey was fought, the English power in\r\nIndia had been rapidly growing, and the Cape, which they had not cared\r\nto acquire in 1620, had now become in their eyes a station of capital\r\nimportance. When war broke out between Britain and Holland in 1781, the\r\nEnglish had attempted to seize the Colony, but retired when they found a\r\nstrong French force prepared to aid the Dutch in its defence. Now they\r\nwere again at war with Holland, which, over-run by the armies of\r\nrevolutionary France, had become the Batavian Republic. In 1795 an\r\nEnglish expedition, bearing orders from the Stadholder of the\r\nNetherlands, then a refugee in England, requiring the Company's officers\r\nto admit them, landed at Simon's Bay, and after some slight resistance\r\nobliged Cape Town and its castle to capitulate. Within a few months the\r\ninsurgents at Swellendam and Graaf-Reinet submitted, and British troops\r\nheld the Colony till 1802, when it was restored to the Batavian Republic\r\non the conclusion of the peace of Amiens. Next year, however, war broke\r\nout afresh; and the English government, feeling the extreme importance,\r\nin the great struggle which they were waging with Napoleon, of\r\npossessing a naval stronghold as a half-way house to India, resolved\r\nagain to occupy the Cape. In 1806 a strong force was landed in Table\r\nBay, and after one engagement the Dutch capitulated. In 1814 the English\r\noccupation was turned into permanent sovereignty by a formal cession of\r\nthe Colony on the part of the then restored Stadholder, who received for\r\nit and certain Dutch possessions in South America the sum of £6,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe European population of the Colony, which was thus finally\r\ntransferred to the rule of a foreign though a cognate nation, consisted\r\nin 1806 of about 27,000 persons, mostly of Dutch, with a smaller number\r\nof German or French descent. They had some 30,000 black slaves, and of\r\nthe aboriginal Hottentots about 17,000 remained. Nearly all spoke Dutch,\r\nor rather the rude local dialect into which the Dutch of the original\r\nsettlers (said to have been largely Frieslanders), had degenerated. The\r\ndescendants of the Huguenots had long since lost their French.\r\n\r\nNo people find it agreeable to be handed over to the government of a\r\ndifferent race, and the British administration in the Colony in those\r\ndays was, though restrained by the general principles of English law,\r\nnecessarily autocratic, because representative institutions had never\r\nexisted at the Cape. Still things promised well for the peace and\r\nultimate fusion of the Dutch and English races. They were branches of\r\nthe same Low-German stock, separated by fourteen hundred years of\r\nseparate history, but similar in the fundamental bases of their\r\nrespective characters. Both were attached to liberty, and the British\r\nhad indeed enjoyed at home a much fuller measure of it than had the\r\nDutch in the settled parts of the Colony. Both professed the Protestant\r\nreligion, and the Dutch were less tolerant toward Roman Catholics than\r\nthe English. The two languages retained so much resemblance that it was\r\neasy for an Englishman to learn Dutch and for a Dutchman to learn\r\nEnglish. An observer might have predicted that the two peoples would\r\nsoon, by intercourse and by intermarriage, melt into one, as Dutch and\r\nEnglish had done in New York. For a time it seemed as if this would\r\ncertainly come to pass. The first two British governors were men of high\r\ncharacter, whose administration gave little ground for complaint to the\r\nold inhabitants. The Company's restrictions on trade had been abolished,\r\nand many reforms were introduced by the new rulers. Schools were\r\nfounded, the administration of justice was reorganised under new courts,\r\nthe breed of cattle and horses was improved, the slave-trade was\r\nforbidden, and missions to the natives were largely developed. Meanwhile\r\nlocal institutions were scarcely altered, and the official use of the\r\nDutch language was maintained. The Roman-Dutch law, which had been in\r\nforce under the Company's rule, was permitted to remain, and it is\r\nto-day the common law of all the British colonies and territories, as\r\nwell as of the Boer Republics, in South Africa. Intermarriage began, and\r\nthe social relations of the few English who had come in after 1806, with\r\nthe many Dutch were friendly. In 1820 the British government sent out\r\nabout five thousand emigrants from England and Scotland, who settled in\r\nthe thinly occupied country round Algoa Bay on the eastern border of the\r\nColony; and from that time on there was a steady, though never copious,\r\ninflux of British settlers, through whose presence the use of the\r\nEnglish language increased, together with a smaller influx of Germans,\r\nwho soon lost their national individuality and came to speak either\r\nEnglish or the local Dutch.\r\n\r\nBefore long, however, this fair promise of peace and union was\r\noverclouded, and the causes which checked the fusion of the races in the\r\nColony, and created two Dutch Republics beyond its limits, have had such\r\nmomentous results that they need to be clearly stated.\r\n\r\nThe first was to be found in the character of the Dutch population. They\r\nwere farmers, a few dwelling in villages and cultivating the soil, but\r\nthe majority stock-farmers, living scattered over a wide expanse of\r\ncountry, for the thinness of the pasture had made and kept the\r\nstock-farms very large. They saw little of one another, and nothing of\r\nthose who dwelt in the few towns which the Colony possessed. They were\r\nignorant, prejudiced, strongly attached to their old habits, impatient\r\nof any control. The opportunities for intercourse between them and the\r\nBritish were thus so few that the two races acquired very little\r\nknowledge of one another, and the process of social fusion, though easy\r\nat Capetown and wherever else the population was tolerably dense, was\r\nextremely slow over the country at large. A deplorable incident which\r\nbefell on the eastern border in 1815 did much to create bad blood. A\r\nslight rising, due to the attempted arrest of a farmer on a charge of\r\nmaltreating his native servant, broke out there. It was soon suppressed,\r\nbut of the prisoners taken six were condemned to death and five were\r\nhanged. This harsh act, which was at the time justified as a piece of\r\n\"necessary firmness,\" produced wide-spread and bitter resentment, and\r\nthe mention of Slagter's Nek continued for many years to awaken an\r\noutburst of anti-British feeling among the Boers.\r\n\r\nA second cause was the unwisdom of the British authorities in altering\r\n(between 1825 and 1828) the old system of local government (with the\r\neffect of reducing the share in it which the citizens had enjoyed), and\r\nin substituting English for Dutch as the language to be used in official\r\ndocuments and legal proceedings. This was a serious hardship, for\r\nprobably not more than one-sixth of the people understood English. A\r\nthird source of trouble arose out of the wars with the Kafirs on the\r\neastern border. Since the first hostilities of 1779 there had been four\r\nserious struggles with the tribes who lived beyond the Fish River, and\r\nin 1834 a host of savages suddenly burst into the Colony, sweeping off\r\nthe cattle and killing the farmers. After some hard fighting the Kafirs\r\nwere reduced to sue for peace, and compelled by the governor to withdraw\r\nbeyond the Keiskama River. But the British government at home,\r\nconsidering that the natives had been ill-treated by the colonists, and\r\nin fact provoked to war, overruled the governor, and allowed them to\r\nreturn to their old seats, where they were, no doubt, a source of danger\r\nto the border farmers. Thinking the home authorities either weak or\r\nperverse, the farmers bitterly resented this action, and began to look\r\non the British Colonial Office as their enemy.\r\n\r\nBut the main grievance arose out of those native and colour questions\r\nwhich have ever since continued to trouble South Africa. Slavery had\r\nexisted in the Colony since 1658, and had produced its usual\r\nconsequences, the degradation of labour, and the notion that the black\r\nman has no rights against the white. In 1737 the first Moravian mission\r\nto the Hottentots was frowned upon, and a pastor who had baptized\r\nnatives found himself obliged to return to Europe. The current of\r\nfeeling in Europe, and especially in England, which condemned the\r\n\"domestic institution\" and sought to vindicate the human rights of the\r\nnegro, had not been felt in this remote corner of the world, and from\r\nabout 1810 onward the English missionaries gave intense offence to the\r\ncolonists by espousing the cause of the natives and the slaves, and\r\nreporting every case of cruel or harsh treatment which came to their\r\nknowledge. It is said that they often exaggerated, or made charges on\r\ninsufficient evidence, and this is likely enough. But it must also be\r\nremembered that they were the only protectors the blacks had; and where\r\nslavery exists, and a weak race is dominated by a strong one, there are\r\nsure to be many abuses of power. When, in 1828, Hottentots and other\r\nfree coloured people were placed by governmental ordinance on an equal\r\nfooting with whites as regards private civil rights, the colonists were\r\nprofoundly disgusted, and their exasperation was increased by the\r\nenactment of laws restraining their authority over their slaves, as well\r\nas by the charges of ill-treating the natives which continued to be\r\nbrought against them by the missionaries. Finally, in 1834, the British\r\nParliament passed a statute emancipating the slaves throughout all the\r\nBritish colonies, and awarding a sum of twenty million pounds sterling\r\nas compensation to the slave-owners. The part of this sum allotted to\r\nCape Colony (a little more than three millions sterling) was\r\nconsiderably below the value of the slaves (about 39,000) held there,\r\nand as the compensation was made payable in London, most slave owners\r\nsold their claims at inadequate prices. Many farmers lost the bulk of\r\ntheir property, and labour became in many districts so scarce that\r\nagriculture could hardly be carried on. The irritation produced by the\r\nloss thus suffered, intensifying the already existing discontent, set up\r\na ferment among the Dutch farmers. Their spirit had always been\r\nindependent, and the circumstances of their isolated life had enabled\r\nthem to indulge it. Even under the government of their Dutch kinsfolk\r\nthey had been restless, and now they received, as they thought, one\r\ninjustice after another at the hands of alien rulers. To be watched and\r\ndenounced by the missionaries, to have black people put on a level with\r\nthem, to lose the fruits of their victory over the Kafirs--all these\r\nthings had been bad enough. Now, however, when their property itself was\r\ntaken away and slavery abolished on grounds they could neither\r\nunderstand nor approve, they determined to endure no longer, and sought\r\nfor some means of deliverance. Rebellion against so strong a power as\r\nthat of Britain was evidently foredoomed to failure. But to the north\r\nand east a great wild country lay open before them, where they could\r\nlead that solitary and half-nomadic life which they loved, preserve\r\ntheir old customs, and deal with the natives as they pleased, unvexed by\r\nthe meddlesome English. Accordingly, many resolved to quit the Colony\r\naltogether and go out into the wilderness. They were the more disposed\r\nto this course, because they knew that the wars and conquests of Tshaka,\r\nthe ferocious Zulu king, had exterminated the Kafir population through\r\nparts of the interior, which therefore stood open to European\r\nsettlement. Thus it was that the Great Trek, as the Dutch call it,--the\r\ngreat emigration, or secession, as we should say,--of the Dutch Boers\r\nbegan in 1836, twenty-five years before another question of colour and\r\nslavery brought about a still greater secession on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will here refer to the map, and measure from Cape Town a\r\ndistance of about four hundred and fifty miles to the east (to the mouth\r\nof the Great Fish River), and about the same distance to the\r\nnorth-north-east (to where the towns of Middelburg and Colesberg now\r\nstand), he will obtain a pretty fair idea of the limits of European\r\nsettlement in 1836. The outer parts of this area toward the north and\r\neast were very thinly peopled, and beyond them there was a vast\r\nwilderness, into which only a few hunters had penetrated, though some\r\nfarmers had, during the last decade or two, been accustomed to drive\r\ntheir flocks and herds into the fringe of it after the rains, in search\r\nof fresh pastures. The regions still farther to the north and east were\r\nalmost entirely unexplored. They were full of wild beasts, and occupied\r\nhere and there by native tribes, some, like the various branches of the\r\nZulu race, eminently fierce and warlike. Large tracts, however, were\r\nbelieved to be empty and desolate, owing to the devastations wrought\r\nduring his twenty years of reign by Tshaka, who had been murdered eight\r\nyears before. Of the existence of mineral wealth no one dreamed. But it\r\nwas believed that there was good grazing land to be found on the upland\r\nthat lay north of the great Quathlamba Range (where now the map shows\r\nthe Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic). More to the south lay\r\nthe territory we now call Natal. It was described by those very few\r\npersons who had explored it as fertile and well-watered, a country fit\r\nboth for tillage and for pasture; but wide plains and high mountains had\r\nto be crossed to reach it by land from the north-west, and close to it\r\non the north-east was the main body of the Zulu nation, under King\r\nDingaan, the brother and sucessor of Tshaka.\r\n\r\nInto this wilderness did the farmers set forth, and though some less\r\nlaudable motives may have been mingled with the love of independence and\r\nthe resentment at injustice which mainly prompted their emigration, it\r\nis impossible not to admire their strenuous and valiant spirit. They\r\nwere a religious people, knowing no book but the Bible, and they deemed\r\nthemselves, like many another religious people at a like crisis of their\r\nfortunes, to be under the special protection of Heaven, as was Israel\r\nwhen it went out of Egypt into a wilderness not so vast nor so full of\r\nperils as was that which the Boers were entering. Escaping from a sway\r\nwhich they compared to that of the Egyptian king, they probably expected\r\nto be stopped or turned back. But Pharaoh, though he had turned a deaf\r\near to their complaints, was imbued with the British spirit of legality.\r\nHe consulted his attorney-general, and did not pursue them. The colonial\r\ngovernment saw with concern the departure of so many useful subjects.\r\nBut it was advised that it had no legal right to stop them, so it stood\r\nby silently while party after party of emigrants--each householder with\r\nhis wife and his little ones, his flocks and his herds and all his\r\ngoods--took its slow way from the eastern or northern parts of the\r\nColony, up the slopes of the coast range, and across the passes that\r\nlead into the high plateau behind. Within two years from 6,000 to 10,000\r\npersons set forth. They travelled in large covered wagons drawn by ten\r\nor twelve yoke of oxen, and they were obliged to travel in parties of no\r\ngreat size, lest their cattle should exhaust the pasture along the track\r\nthey followed. There was, however a general concert of plan among them,\r\nand most of the smaller groups united at spots previously fixed upon for\r\na rendezvous. All the men were armed, for the needs of defence against\r\nthe Bushmen, and the passion for killing game, had made the farmers\r\nexpert in the use of the rifle. As marksmen they were unusually steady\r\nand skilful, and in the struggles that followed nothing but their\r\nmarksmanship saved them. Few to-day survive of those who took part in\r\nthis Great Trek, but among those few is Paul Kruger, now President of\r\nthe South African Republic, who followed his father's cattle as they\r\nwere driven forward across the prairie, being then a boy of ten.\r\n\r\nI have not space to tell, save in the briefest outline, the striking and\r\nromantic story of the wanderings of the emigrant Boers and their\r\nconflicts with the native tribes. The first party, like the first host\r\nof Crusaders that started for the East in the end of the eleventh\r\ncentury, perished miserably. It consisted of ninety-eight persons\r\ntravelling with thirty wagons. They penetrated far to the north-east,\r\ninto what is now the territory of the Transvaal Republic. Some were cut\r\noff by the natives; some, reduced to a mere handful by fever and by the\r\nloss of their cattle,--for they had ventured into the unhealthy lower\r\ncountry to the south-east of the mountains, where the tsetse-fly\r\nabounds,--made their way to the coast at Delagoa Bay. Another party,\r\nformed by the union of a number of smaller bodies at Thaba 'Ntshu, a\r\nrocky peak in the Orange Free State, visible on the eastern horizon from\r\nthe present town of Bloemfontein, advanced thence to the north, and\r\npresently came in contact with a redoubtable branch of the Zulu race,\r\nfamous in later history under the name of Matabili. This tribe was then\r\nruled by the chief Umzilikazi, or Mosilikatze, a warrior of great energy\r\nand talent. He had been one of Tshaka's favourite generals, but, having\r\nincurred that king's displeasure, had fled, about A.D. 1817, with his\r\nregiment to the north-west, and established his headquarters near a\r\nplace called Mosega (between Pretoria and Mafeking), in what is now the\r\nTransvaal Republic. Thence he raided and massacred the Bechuanas and\r\nother tribes of this region, though himself unable to withstand the main\r\nZulu nation, which, under Dingaan, was living farther to the south. The\r\nMatabili provoked war by falling upon and destroying a detachment of the\r\nemigrants. Intruders the latter doubtless were, but, as the Matabili\r\nthemselves had slaughtered without mercy the weaker Kafir tribes, the\r\nBoers might think they need not feel any compunction in dealing out the\r\nlike measure to their antagonists. And, in point of fact, the emigrants\r\nseem all through to have treated the natives much as Israel treated the\r\nnatives of Canaan, and to have conceived themselves to have Old\r\nTestament authority for occupying the territories of the heathen, and\r\nreducing them by the sternest methods to serfdom or submission. Here\r\nthey had an unprovoked massacre to avenge, and they showed equal\r\npromptitude and courage. Pouncing upon Mosilikatze, they defeated his\r\nvastly superior force with so great a slaughter that he fled\r\nnorth-westward far away beyond the Limpopo River, and fell like a\r\nthunderbolt upon the tribes who dwelt between that stream and the\r\nZambesi, killing many and making slaves of the rest. Here, with the\r\nking's kraal of Buluwayo for its capital, was established the kingdom of\r\nthe Matabili, which remained as a terror to its neighbours till, in its\r\nturn, destroyed by Dr. Jameson and the British South Africa Company in\r\n1893. It was a curious chain of events that brought fire and slaughter\r\nso suddenly, in 1837, upon the peoples of the Zambesi Valley. As the\r\nconflicts of nomad warriors along the great wall of China in the fourth\r\ncentury of our era set a-going a movement which, propagated from tribe\r\nto tribe, ended by precipitating the Goths upon the Mediterranean\r\ncountries, and brought Alaric to the Salarian Gate of Rome, so the\r\ncollapse of the French monarchy, inducing the Revolution and the\r\nconsequent war with England, carried the English to the Cape, brought\r\nthe Boers into collision with the Matabili, and at last hurled the\r\nsavage host of Mosilikatze on the helpless Makalakas.\r\n\r\nThe defeat and expulsion of the Matabili left the vast territories\r\nbetween the Orange River and the Limpopo in the hands of the Boer\r\nimmigrants. Within these territories, after much moving hither and\r\nthither, those small and rude communities began to grow up which have\r\nripened, as we shall presently see, into the two Dutch republics of our\r\nown time. But, meanwhile, a larger and better organized body of Boers,\r\nled by a capable and much-respected man named Pieter Retief, marched\r\nfirst eastward and then southward across the Quathlamba watershed, and\r\ndescended from the plateau into the richer and warmer country between\r\nthose mountains and the Indian Ocean. This region had been in 1820\r\nalmost depopulated by the invasions of Tshaka, and now contained scarce\r\nany native inhabitants. A few Englishmen had since 1824 been settled on\r\nthe inlet then called Port Natal, where now the prosperous town of\r\nDurban lies beneath the villas and orchards of Berea, and (having\r\nobtained a cession of the maritime slip from King Tshaka) were\r\nmaintaining there a sort of provisional republic. In 1835 they had asked\r\nto be recognised as a colony under the name of Victoria, in honour of\r\nthe young princess who two years afterwards mounted the throne, and to\r\nhave a legislature granted them. The British government, however, was\r\nstill hesitating whether it should occupy the port, so the emigrants did\r\nnot trouble themselves about its rights or wishes. Thinking it well to\r\npropitiate the Zulu king, Dingaan, whose power over-shadowed the\r\ncountry, the Boer leaders proceeded to his kraal to obtain from him a\r\nformal grant of land. The grant was made, but next day the treacherous\r\ntyrant, offering them some native beer as a sort of stirrup-cup before\r\ntheir departure, suddenly bade his men fall upon and \"kill the wizards.\"\r\nThe excellent Retief perished with his whole party, and a body of\r\nemigrants not far distant was similarly surprised and massacred by a\r\nZulu army of overwhelming strength. These cruelties roused the rest of\r\nthe emigrants to reprisals, and in a fierce battle, fought on December\r\n16, 1838, the anniversary of which is still celebrated by the people of\r\nthe Transvaal, a handful of Boers overthrew Dingaan's host. Like the\r\nsoldiers of Cortes in Mexico, they owed this, as other victories, not\r\nmerely to their steady valour, but to their horses. Riding up to the\r\nline of savage warriors, they delivered a volley, and rode back before\r\nan assagai could reach them, repeating this manoeuvre over and over\r\nagain till the hostile ranks broke and fled. Ultimately their forces,\r\nunited with those of a brother of Dingaan, who had rebelled against him\r\nand had detached a large part of the Zulu warriors, drove Dingaan out of\r\nZululand in 1840. Panda, the rebel brother, was installed king in his\r\nstead, as a sort of vassal to the Boer government, which was now\r\nentitled the republic of Natalia, and the Boers founded a city,\r\nPietermaritzburg, and began to portion out the land. They deemed the\r\nBritish authorities to have abandoned any claim to the country by the\r\nwithdrawal of a detachment of troops which had been landed at Port Natal\r\nin 1838. But their action, and in particular their ejection from the\r\ncountry of a mass of Kafirs whom they proposed to place in a district\r\nalready occupied by another tribe, had meanwhile excited the\r\ndispleasure of the government of Cape Colony. That government, though it\r\nhad not followed them into the deserts of the interior, had never\r\nrenounced, and indeed had now and then reasserted its right to consider\r\nthem British subjects. They, however, repudiated all idea of subjection,\r\nholding British sovereignty to be purely territorial, so that when they\r\nhad passed out of the region which the British crown claimed they had\r\nbecome a free and independent people, standing alone in the world. Their\r\nattempt to establish a new white state on the coast was a matter of\r\nserious concern, because it might affect trade with the interior, and\r\nplant in a region which Britain deemed her own the germ of what might\r\nbecome a new maritime power. And as the colonial government considered\r\nitself the general protector of the natives, and interested in\r\nmaintaining the Kafirs between the Boer state and Cape Colony, the\r\nattacks of the Boers on the Kafirs who lived to the west of them toward\r\nthe Colony, could not be permitted to pass unchecked. The British\r\ngovernment, though still unwilling to assume fresh responsibilities, for\r\nin those days it was generally believed that the colonial possessions of\r\nBritain were already too extensive, nevertheless ultimately concluded,\r\nfor the reasons given above, to assert its authority over Port Natal and\r\nthe country behind as far as the crest of the mountains. A small force\r\nwas accordingly sent to Port Natal in 1842. It was there besieged by the\r\nBoer levies, and would have been forced to surrender but for the daring\r\nten days' ride through the whole breadth of Kaffraria of a young\r\nEnglishman, Richard King, who brought the news to Graham's Town, six\r\nhundred miles distant. A force sent by sea relieved the starving\r\ngarrison after a siege of twenty-six days. The Boer forces dispersed,\r\nbut it was not till a year later that the territory of Natal was\r\nformally declared a British colony. Lord Stanley, then colonial\r\nsecretary, was reluctant to take over the responsibilities of a new\r\ndominion with a disaffected white population and a mass of savage\r\ninhabitants, and only yielded to the urgent arguments of Sir George\r\nNapier, then governor of the Cape. In 1843, after long and angry debates\r\n(sometimes interrupted by the women, who passionately denounced the\r\nBritish government), the Volksraad, or popular assembly of the tiny\r\nrepublic, submitted to the British crown, having delivered a warm but\r\nineffectual protest against the principle of equal civil rights for\r\nwhites and blacks laid down by the British government. The colony of\r\nNatal was then constituted, first (1845) as a dependency of Cape Colony,\r\nafterward (1856) as a separate colony. A part of the Boers, estimated at\r\nfive hundred families, remained in it; but the majority, including all\r\nthe fiercer spirits, recrossed the mountains (some forthwith, some five\r\nyears later), with their cattle, and joined the mass of their\r\nfellow-emigrants who had remained on the plateaus of the interior.\r\nMeanwhile an immense influx of Kafirs, mostly from Zululand, although\r\nmany belonged to other tribes whom the Zulus had conquered, repopulated\r\nthe country, and in it the blacks have since been about ten times as\r\nnumerous as the whites. Thus ended the Dutch republic of Natalia, after\r\nsix years of troubled life. While it was fighting with the Zulus on the\r\neast, and other Kafirs on the west, it was torn by incessant intestine\r\nquarrels, and unable either to levy taxes, or to compel for any other\r\npurpose the obedience of its own citizens. But its victories over\r\nDingaan's armies were feats of arms as remarkable as any South Africa\r\nhas seen. The English are not generally slow to recognize the fine\r\nqualities of their adversaries, but they have done less than justice to\r\nthe resolution and the daring which the Boers displayed in these early\r\ncampaigns against the natives.[20]\r\n\r\nWith the British annexation of Natal ended the first of the attempts\r\nwhich the emigrant Boers have made to obtain access to the sea. It was a\r\nturning-point in the history of South Africa, for it secured to Great\r\nBritain that command of the coast which has ever since been seen to be\r\nmore and more vital to her predominance, and it established a new centre\r\nof English settlement in a region till then neglected, from whence large\r\nterritories, including Zululand and, recently, Southern Tongaland, have\r\nbeen acquired. Although Britain purported to act, and, indeed, in a\r\ncertain sense did act, in self-defence, one cannot repress a feeling\r\nthat the Boer settlers, who had occupied a territory they found vacant\r\nand had broken the power of the savage Zulu king, were hardly used. They\r\nought, at any rate, to have had earlier notice of British intentions.\r\nBut against this may be set the fact that the internal dissensions which\r\nrent the infant republic would have sooner or later brought it to the\r\nground, compelling British intervention, and that the native races have\r\nfared better under British control than they seemed likely to do under\r\nthat of the Boers, whose behaviour towards them, though little more\r\nharsh than that of the English colonists, has been much less considerate\r\nthan that of the Imperial Government.\r\n\r\nHardly less troubled was the lot of the emigrants who had scattered\r\nthemselves over the wide uplands that lie between the Orange River and\r\nthe Limpopo. They, too, were engaged in incessant wars with the native\r\ntribes, who were, however, less formidable than the Zulus, and much\r\ncattle lifting went on upon both sides. Only one native tribe and one\r\nnative chief stand out from the confused tangle of petty raids and\r\nforays which makes up (after the expulsion of the Matabili) the earlier\r\nannals of the Boer communities. This chief was the famous Moshesh, to\r\nspeak of whose career I may digress for a moment from the thread of this\r\nnarrative. The Kafir races have produced within this century three\r\nreally remarkable men--men who, like Toussaint l'Ouverture in Hayti, and\r\nKamehameha I. in Hawaii, will go down in history as instances of the\r\ngifts that sometimes show themselves even among the most backward races.\r\nTshaka, the Zulu, was a warrior of extraordinary energy and ambition,\r\nwhose power of organization enabled him to raise the Zulu army within a\r\nfew years to a perfection of drill and discipline and a swiftness of\r\nmovement which made them irresistible, except by Europeans. Khama, the\r\nchief who still reigns among the Bechuanas, has been a social reformer\r\nand administrator of judgment, tact, and firmness, who has kept his\r\npeople in domestic peace and protected them from the dangerous\r\ninfluences which white civilization brings with it, while at the same\r\ntime helping them onward toward such improvements as their character\r\nadmits. Moshesh, chief of the Basutos, was born in the end of the\r\neighteenth century. He belonged to a small clan which had suffered\r\nseverely in the wars caused by the conquest of Tshaka, whose attacks\r\nupon the tribes nearest him had driven them upon other tribes, and\r\nbrought slaughter and confusion upon the whole of South-eastern Africa.\r\nThough only a younger son, his enterprise and courage soon made him a\r\nleader. The progress of his power was aided by the skill he showed in\r\nselecting for his residence and stronghold a flat topped hill called\r\nThaba Bosiyo, fenced round by cliffs, with pasture for his cattle, and\r\nseveral springs of water. In this impregnable stronghold, from which he\r\ndrew his title of \"chief of the mountain,\" he resisted repeated sieges\r\nby his native enemies and by the emigrant Boers. The exploits of Moshesh\r\nagainst his native foes soon brought adherents round him, and he became\r\nthe head of that powerful tribe, largely formed out of the fragments of\r\nother tribes scattered and shattered by war, which is now called the\r\nBasuto. Unlike most Kafir warriors, he was singularly free from\r\ncruelty, and ruled his own people with a mildness which made him liked\r\nas well as respected. In 1832 he had the foresight to invite\r\nmissionaries to come and settle among his people, and the following year\r\nsaw the establishment of the mission of the Evangelical Society of\r\nParis, whose members, some of them French, some Swiss, a few Scotch,\r\nhave been the most potent factors in the subsequent history of the\r\nBasuto nation. When the inevitable collision between the Basutos and the\r\nwhite men arrived, Moshesh, partly through counsels of the missionaries,\r\npartly from his own prudence, did his best to avoid any fatal breach\r\nwith the British Government. Nevertheless, he was several times engaged\r\nin war with the Orange River Boers, and once had to withstand the attack\r\nof a strong British force led by the governor of Cape Colony. But his\r\ntactful diplomacy made him a match for any European opponent, and\r\ncarried him through every political danger. Moshesh died, full of years\r\nand honour, about twenty-eight years ago, having built up, out of the\r\ndispersed remnants of broken tribes, a nation which has now, under the\r\nguiding hand of the missionaries, and latterly of the British Government\r\nalso, made greater progress in civilization and Christianity than any\r\nother Kafir race. Of its present condition I shall speak in a later\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn back to pursue the story of the fortunes of the emigrant\r\nBoers who had remained on the landward or northerly side of the\r\nQuathlamba Range, or had returned thither from Natal. In 1843 they\r\nnumbered not more than 15,000 persons all told, possibly less; for,\r\nthough after 1838 fresh emigrants from the Colony had joined them, many\r\nhad perished in the native wars. Subsequently, down to the end of 1847,\r\nthese numbers were increased by others, who returned from Natal,\r\ndispleased at the land settlement made there; and while these Natalians\r\nsettled, some to the south-west, round Winburg, others farther north,\r\nin the region between Pretoria and the Vaal River, the earlier Boer\r\noccupants of the latter region moved off still farther north, some to\r\nLydenburg, some to the Zoutpansberg and the country sloping to the\r\nLimpopo River. Thus the emigrant Dutch were now scattered over an area\r\nseven hundred miles long and three hundred miles wide, an area bounded\r\non the south-east by the Quathlamba mountain-chain, but on the north and\r\nwest divided by no natural limit from the great plain which stretches\r\nwest to the Atlantic and north to the Zambesi. They were practically\r\nindependent, for the colonial government did not attempt to interfere\r\nwith their internal affairs. But Britain still claimed that they were,\r\nin strict intendment of law, British subjects,[21] and she gave no\r\nrecognition to the governments they set up. To have established any kind\r\nof administration over so wide a territory would have been in any case\r\ndifficult for so small a body of people, probably about four thousand\r\nadult males; but the characteristics which had enabled them to carry out\r\ntheir exodus from Cape Colony and their campaigns of conquest against\r\nthe natives with so much success made the task of organization still\r\nmore difficult. They had in an eminent degree \"the defects of their\r\nqualities.\" They were self-reliant and individualistic to excess; they\r\nloved not only independence, but isolation; they were resolved to make\r\ntheir government absolutely popular, and little disposed to brook the\r\ncontrol even of the authorities they had themselves created. They had,\r\nin fact, a genius for disobedience; their ideal, if one can attribute\r\nany ideals to them, was that of Israel in the days when every man did\r\nthat which was right in his own eyes. It was only for warlike\r\nexpeditions, which they had come to enjoy not only for the sake of the\r\nexcitement, but also because they were able to enrich themselves by the\r\ncapture of cattle, that they could be brought together, and only to\r\ntheir leaders in war that they would yield obedience. Very few had taken\r\nto agriculture, for which, indeed, the dry soil was seldom fitted, and\r\nthe half-nomadic life of stock-farmers, each pasturing his cattle over\r\ngreat tracts of country, confirmed their dissociative instincts.\r\nHowever, the necessities of defence against the natives, and a common\r\nspirit of hostility to the claims of sovereignty which the British\r\ngovernment had never renounced, kept them loosely together. Thus several\r\nsmall republican communities grew up. Each would have preferred to\r\nmanage its affairs by a general meeting of the citizens, and sometimes\r\ntried to do so. But as the citizens dispersed themselves over the\r\ncountry, this became impossible, so authority, such slight authority as\r\nthey could be induced to grant, was in each vested in a small elective\r\nassembly called the Volksraad or Council of the People.\r\n\r\nThese tiny republics were held together by a sort of faintly federative\r\ntie, which rested rather in a common understanding than upon any legal\r\ninstrument, and whose observance was always subject to the passion of\r\nthe moment. The communities which dwelt to the north-east, beyond the\r\nVaal River, while distracted by internal feuds chiefly arising from\r\npersonal or family enmities, were left undisturbed by the colonial\r\ngovernment. They lived hundreds of miles from the nearest British\r\noutpost, and their wars with the Kafirs scarcely affected those tribes\r\nwith whom the British authorities came in contact. Those authorities, as\r\nI have already observed, were in those days, under orders received from\r\nhome, anxious rather to contract than to extend the sphere of imperial\r\ninfluence, and cared little for what happened far out in the wilderness,\r\nexcept whenever the action of the Boers induced troubles among the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise with the emigrants who lived to the south-west, between\r\nthe Vaal River and the frontier of Cape Colony, which was then at the\r\nvillage of Colesberg, between what is now De Aar Junction and the upper\r\ncourse of the Orange River. Here there were endless bickerings between\r\nthe Boers, the rapidly growing native tribe of the Basutos, and the\r\nhalf-breeds called Griquas, hunting clans sprung from Dutch fathers and\r\nHottentot women, who, intermixed with white people, and to some extent\r\ncivilized by the missionaries, were scattered over the country from\r\nwhere the town of Kimberley now stands southward to the junction of the\r\nOrange and Caledon rivers. These quarrels, with the perpetual risk of a\r\nserious native war arising from them, distressed a succession of\r\ngovernors at Cape Town and a succession of colonial secretaries in\r\nDowning Street. Britain did not wish (if I may use a commercial term not\r\nunsuited to her state of mind) \"to increase her holding\" in South\r\nAfrica. She regarded the Cape as the least prosperous and promising of\r\nher colonies, with an arid soil, a population largely alien, and an\r\napparently endless series of costly Kafir wars. She desired to avoid all\r\nfurther annexations of territory, because each annexation brought fresh\r\nresponsibilities, and fresh responsibilities involved increased\r\nexpenditure. At last a plan was proposed by Dr. Philip, a prominent\r\nmissionary who had acquired influence with the government. The\r\nmissionaries were the only responsible persons who knew much about the\r\nwild interior, and they were often called on to discharge functions\r\nsimilar to those which the bishops performed for the barbarian kings in\r\nwestern Europe in the fifth and sixth centuries of our era. The\r\nsocieties which they represented commanded some influence in Parliament;\r\nand this fact also disposed the Colonial Office to consult them. Dr.\r\nPhilip suggested the creation along the north-eastern border of a line\r\nof native states which should sever the Colony from the unsettled\r\ndistricts, and should isolate the more turbulent emigrant Boers from\r\nthose who had remained quietly in the Colony. This plan was adopted.\r\nTreaties were made in 1843 with Moshesh, the Basuto chief, and with Adam\r\nKok, a Griqua captain living on the Orange River, as a treaty had been\r\nmade nine years before with another Griqua leader named Waterboer, who\r\nlived farther north (near the present site of Kimberley); and these\r\nthree states, all recognized by Britain, were intended to cover the\r\nColony on the side where troubles were most feared. But the arrangement\r\nsoon broke down, for the whites would not recognize a Griqua captain,\r\nwhile the whole troubles between them and the natives continued.\r\nAccordingly, a forward step was taken in 1846 by placing a few British\r\ntroops under a military resident at Bloemfontein, half-way between the\r\nOrange and Vaal rivers, to keep order there. And in 1848 the whole\r\nregion from the Orange to the Vaal was formally annexed under the name\r\nof the Orange River Sovereignty. The country had been without any\r\ngovernment, for the emigrants who dwelt in it had no organization of\r\ntheir own, and did not recognize the republics beyond the Vaal.\r\n\r\nThis formal assertion of British authority provoked an outbreak among\r\nthose of the emigrants, all, or nearly all, of Boer stock, who clung to\r\ntheir independence. Roused and reinforced by their Boer brethren from\r\nbeyond the Vaal, who were commanded by Andries Pretorius, the most\r\nenergetic and capable of the emigrant leaders, and the same who had\r\nbesieged the British troops at Port Natal, they attacked Bloemfontein,\r\nobliged the Resident's small force to capitulate, and advanced south to\r\nthe Orange River. Sir Harry Smith, then Governor of the Cape, promptly\r\nmoved forward a small force, defeated the Boers in a sharp skirmish at\r\nBoomplats (August 29, 1848), and re-established British authority over\r\nthe Sovereignty, which was not, however, incorporated with Cape Colony.\r\nThe Boers beyond the Vaal were left to themselves.\r\n\r\nPeace, however, was not yet assured. Fresh quarrels broke out among the\r\nnative tribes, ending in a war between the Basutos and the British\r\nResident. Unsupported by a large section of the local farmers, who\r\nremained disaffected to the government, and preferred to make their own\r\nterms with the Basutos, and having only a trifling armed force at his\r\ncommand, the Resident fared ill; and his position became worse when\r\nPretorius, still powerful beyond the Vaal, threatened to move in and\r\nside with the Basutos. Cape Colony was at that moment involved in a\r\nserious war with the Kafirs of the south coast, and could spare no\r\ntroops for these northern troubles. So when Pretorius intimated that he\r\nand the northern Boers wished to make some permanent and pacific\r\narrangement with Britain, which, though it did not claim their\r\nterritory, still claimed their allegiance, commissioners were sent to\r\nnegotiate with him and those of the northern or Transvaal group of\r\nemigrants who recognized his leadership, for there were other factions\r\nwho stood apart by themselves. Thus in 1852 a convention was concluded\r\nat Sand River with \"the commandant and delegates of the Boers living\r\nbeyond the Vaal,\" by which the British government \"guaranteed to the\r\nemigrant farmers beyond the Vaal River the right to manage their own\r\naffairs, and to govern themselves according to their own laws without\r\nany interference on the part of the British government,\" with provisions\r\n\"disclaiming all alliances with any of the coloured nations north of the\r\nVaal River,\" permitting the emigrants to purchase ammunition in the\r\nBritish colonies, and declaring that \"no slavery is or shall be\r\npermitted or practised by the farmers in the country north of the Vaal\r\nRiver.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this Sand River convention the South African Republic, afterward\r\nslowly formed out of the small communities which then divided the\r\ncountry, dates its independence; and by the same instrument it\r\npractically severed itself from the Boer emigrants who were left in the\r\nOrange River Sovereignty south of the Vaal, conduct which the republican\r\nparty among these emigrants deemed a betrayal. That Sovereignty remained\r\nBritish, and probably would have so continued but for an unexpected\r\nincident. It was still vexed by the war with the Basutos, and when\r\nGeneral Cathcart, who had now come out as Governor of the Cape, attacked\r\nMoshesh with a considerable force of British regulars, he was drawn into\r\na sort of ambush in their difficult country, suffered a serious reverse,\r\nand would have been compelled to invade Basutoland afresh with a larger\r\narmy had not Moshesh prudently asked for peace. Peace was concluded. But\r\nthe British government was weary of these petty and apparently unending\r\nnative wars, and soon after the news of the battle with Moshesh reached\r\nLondon, the Duke of Newcastle, and Lord Aberdeen's government, in which\r\nhe was colonial secretary, resolved to abandon the Sovereignty\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nTo those who look back on 1853 with the eyes of 1899 this seems a\r\nstrange determination, for the British crown had ruled the country for\r\neight years and recently given it a regular new constitution. Moreover,\r\nwhereas the farmers beyond the Vaal were nearly all of pure Boer stock,\r\nthose in the Orange River Sovereignty were mixed with English settlers,\r\nand from their proximity to the Colony were much less averse to the\r\nBritish connection. In fact, a large part of them--though it is not now\r\neasy to discover the exact proportion--warmly resisted the proposal of\r\nthe British government to retire, and independence had to be forced on\r\nthem against their will. In Cape Colony, too, and among the\r\nmissionaries, there was a strong repugnance to the policy of withdrawal.\r\nThe authorities of the Colony and the Colonial Office at home were,\r\nhowever, inexorable. They saw no use in keeping territories which were\r\ncostly because they had to be defended against native raids, and from\r\nwhich little benefit was then expected. Hardly any notice had been taken\r\nin Britain of the Sand River convention, which the Conservative ministry\r\nof that day had approved, and when, at the instance of delegates sent\r\nhome by those who, in the Orange River territory, desired to remain\r\nsubject to the British crown, a motion was made in the House of Commons\r\nasking the Queen to reconsider the renunciation of her sovereignty over\r\nthat territory, the motion found no support and had to be withdrawn.\r\nParliament, indeed, went so far as to vote forty-eight thousand pounds\r\nby way of compensation, in order to get rid of this large territory and\r\na great number of attached subjects. So little did Englishmen then care\r\nfor that South African dominion which they have subsequently become so\r\neager to develop and extend.\r\n\r\nBy the convention signed at Bloemfontein on February 23, 1854, the\r\nBritish government \"guaranteed the future independence of the country\r\nand its government,\" and its inhabitants were \"declared, to all intents\r\nand purposes, a free and independent people.\" No slavery or trade in\r\nslaves was to be permitted north of the Orange River. The Orange River\r\ngovernment was to be free to purchase ammunition in the British\r\ncolonies, and liberal privileges in connection with import duties were\r\nto be granted to it.\r\n\r\nThese two conventions of 1852 and 1854 are epochs of supreme importance\r\nin South African history, for they mark the first establishment of\r\nnon-British independent states, whose relations with the British\r\ncolonies were thereafter to constitute the central thread in the annals\r\nof the country. As that of 1852 recognised the Transvaal State, so from\r\nthat of 1854, which is a more explicit and complete declaration of\r\nindependence than had been accorded to the Transvaal people two years\r\nbefore, dates the beginning of the second Boer republic, the Orange\r\nFree State, which, subsequently increased by the conquest from the\r\nBasutos of a strip of fertile territory in the south, has ever since\r\nremained perfectly independent and at peace with the British colonies.\r\nIts only serious troubles have arisen from native wars, and these have\r\nlong ago come to an end. In 1854 an assembly of delegates enacted for it\r\nthe republican constitution under which it has ever since been quietly\r\nand peaceably governed. It had the good fortune to elect, as its\r\npresident, in 1865, a lawyer from Cape Colony, of Dutch extraction, Mr.\r\n(afterwards Sir) John Brand, who guided its course with great tact and\r\nwisdom for twenty-four years, and whose favourite expression, \"All shall\r\ncome right,\" now inscribed on his tombstone at Bloemfontein, has become\r\nthroughout South Africa a proverbial phrase of encouragement in moments\r\nof difficulty.[22]\r\n\r\nBeyond the Vaal river things have gone very differently. The farmers of\r\nthat region were more scattered, more rude and uneducated, and more\r\nprone to factious dissensions than those of the Free State proved to be\r\nafter 1854; and while the latter were compressed within definite\r\nboundaries on three sides, the Transvaal Boers were scattered over a\r\npractically limitless area. During the next twenty-five years the\r\nTransvaal people had very little to do with the British government. But\r\nthey were distracted by internal feuds, and involved in almost incessant\r\nstrife with the natives. These two sources of trouble brought their\r\ngovernment, in 1877, to a condition of virtual collapse. But that\r\ncollapse and the annexation which followed it belong to a later phase of\r\nSouth African history, and we must now turn from them to trace the\r\nprogress of events in other parts of the country between 1852 and 1877.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: The best recent account of the doings of the Portuguese is\r\nto be found in Dr. Theal's book, _The Portuguese in South Africa_,\r\npublished in 1896.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: I have heard from Lord Wolseley that in his expedition\r\nagainst Sikukuni, a Kafir chief in the north-east of the Transvaal, he\r\nwas told by a German trader who acted as guide that the natives had\r\nshown to him (the trader) fragments of ancient European armour which\r\nwere preserved in a cave among the mountains. The natives said that this\r\narmour had been worn by white men who had come up from the sea many,\r\nmany years ago, and whom their own ancestors had killed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Maceo, the well-known leader of the Cuban insurgents who\r\nwas killed in 1896, was a half-breed, in whose band there were plenty of\r\npure whites.

(See Bird's\r\n_Annals of Natal_, vol. ii., p. 468.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Some further account of the Orange Free State will be\r\nfound in Chapter XIX.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE EUROPEANS IN SOUTH AFRICA, 1854-95\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1852 and 1856 the history of Anglo-Dutch South Africa\r\nbreaks up into four distinct streams. The Transvaal and South African\r\nRepublic pursues its own course from 1852 onward, the Orange Free State\r\nfrom 1854, and Natal from 1856, in which year that district was\r\nseparated from the Cape and constituted as a distinct colony. Between\r\n1876 and 1880 the South African Republic and Natal are again brought\r\ninto close relations with the march of events in Cape Colony. But before\r\nwe trace the three last mentioned streams in their several courses it is\r\nwell to return to the Cape, by far the largest and most populous of the\r\nfour communities, and sketch in outline the chief events that mark the\r\ndevelopment of that Colony down to the memorable epoch of 1877-81.\r\n\r\nThese events group themselves into three divisions--the material\r\nprogress of Cape Colony, the changes in the form of its government, and\r\nthose wars with the Kafir tribes which, while they retarded its growth\r\nin population, steadily increased its area.\r\n\r\nThe departure of some eight or ten thousand Boers, the most discontented\r\npart of the population, in the years following 1835, not only removed an\r\nelement which, excellent in other respects, was politically at once\r\nunrestful and old-fashioned, but left plenty of vacant space to be\r\noccupied by new immigrants from Europe. New immigrants, however, came\r\nslowly, because at that time the tide of British emigration was setting\r\nmainly to America, while German emigration had hardly begun. The Kafir\r\nwars had, moreover, given South Africa a bad name, and the settlers of\r\n1820 (see above, p. 111) had suffered several years of hardship before\r\nprosperity came to them. However, between 1845 and 1850 four or five\r\nthousand British immigrants were brought in, with the aid of the\r\ngovernment, and a little later a number of Germans who had served\r\nEngland in the German Legion during the Crimean War. Again, in 1858,\r\nmore than two thousand German peasants were settled on the south coast\r\nin lands which had been previously held by Kafirs. These people made\r\ngood colonists, and have now become merged in the British population,\r\nwhich began to predominate in the eastern province as the Dutch still\r\ndoes in the western. As the country filled there was a steady, though\r\nslow, progress in farming and in export trade. The merino sheep had been\r\nintroduced in 1812 and 1820, and its wool had now become a source of\r\nwealth; so, too, had ostrich farming, which began about 1865 and\r\ndeveloped rapidly after the introduction of artificial incubation in\r\n1869. The finances, which had been in disorder, were set right, roads\r\nbegan to be made, churches and schools were established, and though the\r\nKafir raids caused much loss of life and of cattle on the eastern\r\nborder, the cost of these native wars, being chiefly borne by the home\r\ngovernment, did not burden the colonial revenue. In 1859 the first\r\nrailway was constructed, and by 1883 more than one thousand miles of\r\nrailway were open for traffic. There were, however, no industries except\r\nstock-keeping and tillage until 1869-70, when the discovery of diamonds\r\n(of which more anon) brought a sudden rush of immigrants from Europe,\r\nstimulated trade so powerfully that the revenue of the Colony doubled\r\nwithin five years, and began that surprising development of mineral\r\nresources which has been the most striking feature of recent years.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of population, which had risen under British rule from\r\nabout 26,000 Europeans in 1805 to 182,000 in 1865 and 237,000 in 1875,\r\nthere came also changes in the form of government. At first the Governor\r\nwas an autocrat, except so far as he was controlled by the fear that the\r\ncolonists might appeal to the Colonial Office in London against him: and\r\nthe administration was therefore wise or foolish, liberal or severe,\r\naccording to the qualities of the individual Governor. Some serious\r\nmistakes were committed, and one Governor, Lord Charles Somerset, has\r\nleft the reputation of arbitrary rule; but the officials sent out seem,\r\non the whole, to have pursued a more judicious policy and shown more\r\nrespect to local opinion than the representatives of the Dutch East\r\nIndia Company had (with one or two brilliant exceptions) done in the\r\nprevious century. The blunders which preceded the Great Trek of 1836\r\nwere attributable rather to the home government than to its agents on\r\nthe spot, and in the years that followed colonial feeling complained\r\nmore often of Downing-street than it did of Government House at Cape\r\nTown. The irritation which from time to time broke out sprang chiefly\r\nfrom questions connected with the natives. Like all Europeans dwelling\r\namong inferior races, the mass of the colonists, English as well as\r\nDutch, looked upon the native population as existing for their benefit,\r\nand resented the efforts which the home government made to secure for\r\nthe blacks equal civil rights and adequate protection. Their wrath was\r\nspecially kindled by the vehemence with which a few among the\r\nmissionaries denounced any wrongs deemed to have been suffered by the\r\nnatives within the Colony, and argued the case of the Kafir tribes who\r\nwere from time to time in revolt. I do not attempt to apportion the\r\nblame in these disputes; but any one who has watched the relations of\r\nsuperior and inferior races in America or India or the Pacific islands\r\nwill think it probable that many harsh and unjust things were done by\r\nthe colonists, as every one who knows how zeal tends to mislead the\r\njudgment of well-intentioned men will think it no less probable that\r\nthere was some exaggeration on the part of the philanthropic friends of\r\nthe blacks, and that some groundless charges were brought against the\r\ncolonists. The missionaries, especially those of the London Society, had\r\na certain influence with the Colonial Office, and were supposed to have\r\nmuch more than they had. Thus from 1820 to about 1860 there was a\r\nperpetual struggle between the colonists and the missionaries, in which\r\nstruggle the Governor tended to side with the colonists, whose public\r\nopinion he felt round him, while the Colonial Office leaned to the\r\nphilanthropists, who could bring political pressure to bear through the\r\nHouse of Commons. Unfortunate as these bickerings were, they had at\r\nleast the result of tending to unite the Dutch and English elements in\r\nthe population, for on native questions there was little difference of\r\nattitude between those elements.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 a Legislative Council was created, consisting, however, of\r\nofficials and of members nominated by the Governor, and not, as the\r\ncolonists had petitioned, chosen by election. Twenty years later, when\r\nthe population had greatly increased and the demand for representative\r\ninstitutions could no longer be resisted, a regular two-chambered\r\nlegislature was set up, consisting of a Legislative Council and a House\r\nof Assembly, both elected on a wide franchise, with no distinction of\r\nrace or colour, though of course the coloured voters were comparatively\r\nfew, because the tribal Kafirs living under their chiefs were excluded,\r\nwhile of other blacks there was only a small proportion who held\r\nproperty even to the limited extent required for the suffrage. This\r\nlegislature met for the first time in 1854. Four years previously an\r\nevent had occurred which showed how desirable it was that\r\nconstitutional means should be provided for the expression of the\r\npeople's wishes. The home government had sent out a vessel carrying a\r\nnumber of convicts to be landed and kept in the Colony, where no\r\nconvicts had been seen since the days of the Dutch Company. A strong and\r\nunanimous feeling arose at once against this scheme, which was regarded\r\nas likely to prove even more harmful in South Africa than it had proved\r\nin Australia, because there was at the Cape a large native population,\r\namong whom the escaped or released convict, possessing the knowledge and\r\ncapacity of a white man, but unrestrained by any responsibility or sense\r\nof a character to lose, would be able to work untold mischief. The\r\ninhabitants of Cape Town and its neighbourhood held meetings of protest,\r\nsent remonstrances to England, and mutually pledged themselves to supply\r\nno food to the convict ship. This pledge they carried out, and during\r\nthe five months that the convict ship lay in Simon's Bay, it was from\r\nthe naval squadron there that she had to receive provisions. The\r\nColonial Office at last yielded; and the people, while rejoiced at the\r\nsuccess they had achieved, and at the heartiness with which Dutch and\r\nEnglish had co-operated for a common object, were more than ever\r\ndisposed to desire some control over their own affairs.\r\n\r\nAlthough after 1854 the sole power of legislation was vested in the\r\ncolonial Parliament, subject to the right of the British crown to\r\ndisallow an act,--a right which is of course very rarely used,--the\r\nexecutive power still remained with the Governor and his council, who\r\nwere appointed by the home government, and not responsible to the Cape\r\nlegislature. It has, however, become a settled principle of British\r\ncolonial policy to grant to each and every colony not only legislative\r\npower, but responsible executive government so soon as the white\r\npopulation of the Colony has become relatively large enough and settled\r\nenough to enable that kind of constitution to be properly worked. In\r\n1872 the whites of Cape Colony had come to exceed 200,000, and the need\r\nfor a change had been emphasized shortly before by a conflict of opinion\r\nbetween the Governor and the legislature as to the best means of setting\r\nright the finances of the Colony. Parliament having been dissolved, the\r\nnew houses declared for responsible government, and the home government\r\nwisely assented to their wish. Accordingly, the \"cabinet system\" of\r\nBritain was established, the Governor's executive council being turned\r\ninto a ministry responsible to the legislature, and the Governor himself\r\nbecoming a sort of local constitutional sovereign on the model of the\r\nBritish crown, that is to say a sovereign who reigns but does not\r\ngovern, the executive acts done in his name being done by the advice and\r\non the responsibility of the ministry, who hold office at the pleasure\r\nof the legislature. Thus from 1872 onward the Colony has enjoyed\r\ncomplete self-government, and has prospered under it despite the\r\nantagonism which has frequently shown itself between the eastern and\r\nwestern provinces, an antagonism due partly to economic causes, partly\r\nto the predominance of the English element in the former and of the\r\nDutch in the latter region. The working of the cabinet system has been\r\neven smoother than in most of the other British colonies; but while\r\nsetting this to the credit of the good sense and moderation of the\r\npeople, it must also be noted that the most exciting crises which have\r\narisen in South Africa have lain outside the scope of the colonial\r\nministry and legislature, being matters which have touched the two Dutch\r\nrepublics or the relations of British territories to foreign Powers.\r\nThese matters, being international, belong to the British crown, and to\r\nits local representative, the Governor, in his capacity of High\r\nCommissioner for South Africa; and in that capacity he is not required\r\nto consult the Cape ministry and legislature, but acts under the\r\ndirections of the Colonial Office in London.\r\n\r\nThe grant of cabinet government tended to stimulate political life among\r\nthe Dutch farmers, hitherto the more backward part of the population,\r\nand in 1882 their wishes secured a reversal of the ordinance made sixty\r\nyears before for the exclusive use of English in official documents and\r\nlegal proceedings. Dutch was now placed on a level with English as an\r\nofficial language in Parliament and the law courts. But this assertion\r\nof Dutch sentiment was due to causes which will be better understood\r\nwhen we come to the events of 1880 and 1881.\r\n\r\nMost of the peaceful growth which has been described would have been\r\nmore rapid but for the frequent vexation of native wars. Twice under the\r\nrule of the Dutch Company and seven times under the British crown have\r\nthere been sanguinary conflicts with the fierce Kafir tribes of the Kosa\r\ngroup, who dwell in the east of the Colony. On the north there had been\r\nonly Hottentots, a weak nomad race, who soon vanished under the attacks\r\nof smallpox and the pressure of the whites. On the north-east the\r\ndeserts of the Karroo lay between the colonists and the Kafirs who\r\ninhabited the plains of the Upper Orange and Vaal rivers. But on the\r\neast the country was comparatively well watered, and supported a large\r\nKafir population full of courage and fighting spirit. Collisions between\r\nthem and the whites were inevitable. The country they occupied was\r\nmostly rugged, and covered with a dense low wood, or rather scrub,\r\ntraversed by narrow and winding tracks, which were of course familiar to\r\nthem, and difficult for white troops. They had always the advantage in\r\npoint of numbers, and though they were usually beaten and compelled to\r\nsue for peace, the obvious anxiety of the colonial government to\r\nconclude a peace emboldened them to fresh outbreaks. To civilized men,\r\nwho know the enormous superiority of discipline and of firearms, it\r\nseems strange that these natives, who in the earlier wars had no\r\nfirearms, should have so often renewed what we can see was a hopeless\r\nstruggle. But it must be remembered that the natives, who saw only small\r\nwhite forces brought against them, and knew that the whole number of\r\nwhites in the Colony was small, have never realized, and do not realize\r\neven to-day, the enormous reserve of the white population in Europe.\r\nTheir minds cannot take in large numbers, cannot look far forward,\r\ncannot grasp large issues, and are swayed by sudden gusts of feeling\r\nwhich overcome all calculation of results. Accordingly, the Kafirs\r\nreturned over and over again to the contest, while the colonial\r\ngovernment, not wishing to extend its frontiers, and hating the expense\r\nof this unprofitable strife, never grappled with the problem in a large\r\nway, but tried on each occasion to do just enough to restore order for\r\nthe time being. It would probably have been better to have spent once\r\nfor all a large sum in a thorough conquest of the Kosas, planting strong\r\nforts here and there through their country, and organizing a regular\r\ngendarmerie. But until the annexation of Natal in 1843 placed British\r\npower on the other side of these turbulent tribes, the process of\r\nconquest might well seem interminable, for it was plain that as soon as\r\none clan had been brought to submission troubles would break out with\r\nthe next that lay beyond it, and fresh wars have to be undertaken to\r\nreduce each of these in its turn. Some allowance must therefore be made\r\nfor the tendency of the government to take short views and do no more\r\nthan was needed for the moment, especially as nearly every new war\r\nbrought upon the Governor for the time being the displeasure of the\r\nColonial Office, and brought upon the Colonial Office the censure of\r\neconomists and philanthropists at home.\r\n\r\nThe theatre of these wars was the country along the south coast between\r\nAlgoa Bay and the Kei River, and an important step forward was made\r\nwhen, after the wars of 1846-47 and 1851-53, the province of British\r\nKaffraria, extending to the Kei River, was created, placed under\r\nimperial officials, and garrisoned by British regiments. Four years\r\nafterwards, in 1857, the Kafirs of this province, at the bidding of\r\ntheir chiefs, prompted by a wizard who professed to have received\r\nmessages from the world of spirits, destroyed their cattle and their\r\nstores of grain, in the belief that the dead ancestors of the tribe\r\nwould reappear and join them in driving out the white men, while herds\r\nof cattle would issue from the ground and crops would suddenly spring up\r\nand cover the soil. Many of the clans were already on the verge of\r\nfamine when the promised day arrived, and when it had passed starvation\r\nbegan, and within a few months, despite the efforts of the colonial\r\nauthorities to supply food, some 30,000 Kafirs perished of hunger or\r\ndisease. This frightful catastrophe, which carried many thousands\r\nwestward into Cape Colony in search of work, and left large tracts\r\nvacant, led to the establishment in those tracts of white settlers, and\r\nultimately, in 1865, to the union of British Kaffraria with the Colony.\r\nIt also so much weakened the Kosas that for the unprecedentedly long\r\nperiod of twenty years there was no Kafir war. In 1877 and 1880 some\r\nrisings occurred which were suppressed with no great difficulty; and in\r\n1894 the boundaries of the Colony, which had been advancing by a series\r\nof small annexations, were finally rounded off on the eastern side by\r\nthe addition of the territory of the Pondos, which made it conterminous\r\nin that direction with the Colony of Natal.\r\n\r\nTo complete the chronicle of native wars, we ought now to turn to Natal,\r\non whose borders there arose, in 1879, a conflict with the greatest\r\nnative power--that of the Zulus--which the British had yet encountered.\r\nBefore that year, however, a momentous change in British colonial policy\r\nhad occurred, and I must go a little way back to describe the events\r\nwhich gave rise to it.\r\n\r\nThe reader will recollect that in 1852 and 1854 Britain had abjured all\r\npurpose of extending the boundaries of her dominion towards the interior\r\nby recognizing the independence of the two Dutch republics, which date\r\ntheir legal rise from the two conventions concluded in those years. She\r\nhad done so quite honestly, desiring to avoid the expense and\r\nresponsibility which further advances must entail, and with the wish of\r\nleaving the two new republics to work out their own salvation in their\r\nown way. For some years nothing occurred to create fresh difficulties.\r\nBut in 1858 a war broke out between the Orange Free State and the Basuto\r\nchief Moshesh, who claimed land which the Free State farmers had\r\noccupied. The Free State commandos attacked him, and had penetrated\r\nBasutoland as far as the stronghold of Thaba Bosiyo, when they were\r\nobliged to return to protect their own farms from the roving bands of\r\nhorsemen which Moshesh had skilfully detached to operate in their rear.\r\nBeing hard pressed they appealed to the Governor of Cape Colony to\r\nmediate between them and Moshesh. Moshesh agreed, and a new frontier was\r\nsettled by the Governor. However, in 1865 fresh troubles broke out, and\r\nthere was again war between Moshesh and the Free State. The Governor of\r\nCape Colony was again invoked, but his decision was not respected by the\r\nBasutos, whom Moshesh could not always control,--for they are much less\r\nsubmissive to their chiefs than are the Zulus,--and hostilities having\r\nrecommenced after a brief interval of peace, the Free State made a\r\nsupreme effort, and in 1868 was on the point of destroying the Basuto\r\npower, though it had never been able to capture Thaba Bosiyo, when\r\nMoshesh appealed to the High Commissioner to extend British protection\r\nto his people. Unwilling to see Basutoland annexed by the Free State,\r\nand fearing injury to the Colony from the dispersion of Basuto fugitives\r\nthrough it, the High Commissioner consented, and declared the Basutos\r\nBritish subjects. The Free State was suffered to retain a large tract\r\nof fertile land along the north bank of the Caledon River, which it had\r\nconquered; but it was mortified by seeing British authority established\r\nto the south of it, all the way from Natal to the borders of Cape\r\nColony, and by the final extinction of the hopes which it had cherished\r\nof extending its territories to the sea and acquiring a harbour at the\r\nmouth of the St. John's River.\r\n\r\nThese events, which befell in 1869, mark the recommencement of British\r\nadvance toward the interior. Still more momentous was another occurrence\r\nwhich belongs to the same year. In 1869 and 1870 a sudden rush began\r\nfrom all parts of South Africa to a small district between the Modder\r\nand the Vaal rivers (where the town of Kimberley now stands), in which\r\ndiamonds had been discovered. Within a few months thousands of diggers\r\nfrom Europe and America, as well as from the surrounding countries, were\r\nat work here, and the region, hitherto neglected, became a prize of\r\ninestimable value. A question at once arose as to its ownership. The\r\nOrange Free State claimed it, but it was also claimed by a Griqua\r\n(half-breed) captain, named Nicholas Waterboer, son of old Andries\r\nWaterboer, and by a native Batlapin chief, while parts were claimed by\r\nthe Transvaal Republic. The claims of the last-named state were disposed\r\nof by the decision of the Governor of Natal, who had been recognized as\r\narbitrator by the Griquas, the Batlapin, and the President of the\r\nRepublic. He awarded the tract in dispute to Waterboer, including in his\r\naward the part claimed by the Free State, which had refused arbitration\r\nso far as regarded the district lying south of the Vaal, holding that\r\ndistrict to have been indubitably part of the old Orange River\r\nsovereignty, which was in 1854 turned into the Orange Free State. As\r\nWaterboer had before the award offered his territory to the British\r\ngovernment, the country was forthwith erected into a Crown Colony under\r\nthe name of Griqualand West. This was in 1871. The Free State, whose\r\ncase had not been stated, much less argued, before the umpire,\r\nprotested, and was after a time able to appeal to a judgment delivered\r\nby a British court, which found that Waterboer had never enjoyed any\r\nright to the territory. However, the new Colony had by this time been\r\nset up and the British flag displayed. The British government, without\r\neither admitting or denying the Free State title, declared that a\r\ndistrict in which it was difficult to keep order amid a turbulent and\r\nshifting population ought to be under the control of a strong power, and\r\noffered the Free State a sum of ninety thousand pounds in settlement of\r\nwhatever claim it might possess. The acceptance by the Free State in\r\n1876 of this sum closed the controversy, though a sense of injustice\r\ncontinued to rankle in the breasts of some of the citizens of the\r\nRepublic. Amicable relations have subsisted ever since between it and\r\nCape Colony, and the control of the British government over the Basutos\r\nhas secured for it peace in the quarter which was formerly most\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nThese two cases show how various are the causes and how mixed the\r\nmotives which press a great power forward even against the wishes of its\r\nstatesmen. The Basutos were declared British subjects partly out of a\r\nsympathetic wish to rescue and protect them, partly because policy\r\nrequired the acquisition of a country naturally strong and holding an\r\nimportant strategical position. Griqualand West, taken in the belief\r\nthat Waterboer had a good title to it, was retained after this belief\r\nhad been dispelled, partly perhaps because a population had crowded into\r\nit which consisted mainly of British subjects, and was not easily\r\ncontrollable by a small state, but mainly because colonial feeling\r\nrefused to part with a region of such exceptional mineral wealth. And\r\nthe retention of Griqualand West caused, before long, the acquisition of\r\nBechuanaland, which in its turn naturally led to that northward\r\nextension of British influence which has carried the Union Jack to the\r\nshores of Lake Tanganyika. The wish to restrict responsibility, which\r\nhad been so strong twenty years before, had now died out of the British\r\npublic at home, and had grown feebler even in the minds of the statesmen\r\nwhose business it was to find the money needed for these increasing\r\ncharges on the imperial treasury; while the philanthropic interest in\r\nthe native races, stimulated by the discoveries of Livingstone, now took\r\nthe form not of proposing to leave them to themselves, but of desiring\r\nto protect them against the adventurers, whether of Boer or of English\r\nblood, whom it was found impossible to prevent from pressing forward\r\ninto the wilderness.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the change, as yet only an incipient change, in\r\nthe public opinion of the English people, who now began to feel the\r\ndesire not merely to retain but to expand their colonial dominion,\r\nshould have become apparent just at the time when there occurred that\r\ndiscovery of diamonds which showed that this hitherto least progressive\r\nof the larger Colonies possessed unsuspected stores of wealth. The\r\ndiscovery brought a new stream of enterprising and ambitious men into\r\nthe country, and fixed the attention of the world upon it. It was a\r\nturning point in South African history.\r\n\r\nThat change in the views of the British Government on which I have been\r\ncommenting found at this moment a fresh expression in another quarter.\r\nIn 1869 the Portuguese Government concluded a commercial treaty with the\r\nSouth African Republic, under which it seemed probable that a\r\nconsiderable trade might spring up between the Portuguese coast of the\r\nIndian Ocean and the interior. This called attention to the port of\r\nLourenço Marques, on the shore of Delagoa Bay, the best haven upon that\r\ncoast. Great Britain claimed it under a cession which had been obtained\r\nfrom a native chief of the country by a British naval exploring\r\nexpedition in 1822. Portugal, however, resisted the claim. In 1872 it\r\nwas referred to the arbitration of Marshal MacMahon, then President of\r\nthe French Republic, and in 1875 he awarded the territory in dispute to\r\nPortugal. Both cases were weak, and it is not easy to say which was the\r\nweaker, for, although the Portuguese had undoubtedly been first on the\r\nground, their occupation, often disturbed by the native tribes, had been\r\nextremely precarious. The decision was a serious blow to British hopes,\r\nand has become increasingly serious with the further development of the\r\ncountry. Yet it was mitigated by a provision contained in the agreement\r\nfor arbitration that the Power against whom the decision might go should\r\nhave thereafter from the successful Power a right of preëmption as\r\nagainst any other state desiring to purchase the territory.[23] This\r\nprovision is momentous as giving Britain the right to prevent not only\r\nthe South African Republic, but any European power, from acquiring a\r\npoint of the utmost importance both commercial and strategical. Rumours\r\nhave often been circulated that Britain would gladly acquire by purchase\r\nthe harbour of Delagoa Bay, but the sensitive patriotism of the\r\nPortuguese people is at present so strongly opposed to any sale of\r\nterritory that no Portuguese ministry is likely to propose it.[24]\r\n\r\nAt the very time when the attempt to acquire Delagoa Bay revealed the\r\nnew purposes which had begun to animate Great Britain, another scheme\r\nwas suggested to the Colonial Office by the success which had lately\r\nattended its efforts in Canada. In 1867 the passing of the British North\r\nAmerica Act drew the theretofore isolated provinces of the Dominion\r\ninto a confederation, relieving the home government of some grave\r\nresponsibilities, and giving to the whole country the advantages of\r\ncommon administration and legislation in matters of common concern. Lord\r\nCarnarvon, then colonial secretary, threw himself into the idea of\r\nsimilarly uniting the different Colonies and States of South Africa. It\r\nhad been advocated by Sir George Grey, when Governor in 1858, and had\r\neven received the support of the Orange Free State, whose Volksraad\r\npassed a resolution favouring it in that year. Many considerations of\r\npractical convenience suggested this scheme, chief among them the\r\ndesirability of having both a uniform policy in native affairs (the\r\nabsence of which had recently caused trouble) and a common commercial\r\npolicy and tariff system. Accordingly, in 1875 Lord Carnarvon addressed\r\na despatch to the Governor of Cape Colony, recommending such a scheme as\r\nfit to be adopted by that Colony, which three years before had received\r\nresponsible government, and Mr. J.A. Froude was sent out to press it\r\nupon the people. The choice did not prove a fortunate one, but even a\r\nmore skilful emissary would probably have failed, for the moment was\r\ninopportune. The Cape people were not ready for so large and\r\nfar-reaching a proposal. The Orange Free State was exasperated at the\r\nloss of Griqualand West. The Transvaal people, though, as we shall see\r\npresently, their republic was in sore straits, were averse to anything\r\nthat could affect their independence. However, Sir Bartle Frere, the\r\nnext Governor of the Cape, who went out in 1877, entered heartily into\r\nLord Carnarvon's plan, which continued to be pressed till 1880, when it\r\nwas rejected by the Cape Parliament, largely at the instance of envoys\r\nfrom the Transvaal Boers, who urged the Cape Dutch not to accept it\r\nuntil the Transvaal (which, as shall be presently set forth, had been\r\nannexed in 1877) should have regained its independence. This failure of\r\nthe proposals of the home government seriously damaged the prospects of\r\nfuture federation schemes, and is only one of several instances in South\r\nAfrican history that show how much harm impatience may do, even when the\r\nobject is itself laudable.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the forward march of British rule took place far to the\r\nsouth-west, on the borders of Natal. That territory had, in 1856, become\r\na separate Colony, distinct from the Cape, and with a legislative\r\ncouncil three-fourths of whose members were elective. It had still a\r\nrelatively small white population, for many of the Boer immigrants had\r\nquitted it between 1843 and 1848, and though a body of English settlers\r\narrived soon after the latter year, there were in 1878 only some 25,000\r\nwhite residents, while the natives numbered fully 300,000. The Zulu\r\nkingdom, which adjoined it on the east, had passed (in 1872) from the\r\nsluggish Panda to his more energetic son Cetewayo (pronounced\r\n\"Ketshwayo\"), whose ambitious spirit had revived the military\r\norganization and traditions of his uncle Tshaka. Cetewayo had been\r\ninstalled as king by a British official, and had lived ever since at\r\npeace with the Colony; but the powerful army which he possessed roused\r\ndisquiet among the Natalians, and alarmed the then Governor of the Cape\r\nand High Commissioner for South Africa, Sir Bartle Frere. Differences\r\nhad arisen between him and Cetewayo, and when the latter refused to\r\nsubmit to the demands which the High Commissioner addressed to him,\r\nincluding a requirement that he should disband his regiments and receive\r\na British resident, war was declared against him. This act was justified\r\nat the time on the ground that the Zulu military power constituted a\r\nstanding menace to Natal and to South Africa in general, and that the\r\nvast majority of the natives living in Natal itself might join the Zulu\r\nking were he to invade the colony. Whether this risk was sufficiently\r\nimminent to warrant such a step was then, and has been since, warmly\r\ndebated in England. Most of those who have given impartial study to the\r\nsubject, and have studied also the character and earlier career of the\r\nHigh Commissioner, are disposed to think that war might have been and\r\nought to have been avoided, and that Sir Bartle Frere, in declaring it,\r\ncommitted a grave error; but it is right to add that there are persons\r\nin South Africa who still defend his action. The invasion of Zululand\r\nwhich followed began with a disaster--the surprise at Isandhlwana\r\n(January, 1879) of a British force, which was almost annihilated by a\r\nvastly superior native army. Ultimately, however, Cetewayo was defeated\r\nand made prisoner. Zululand was divided among thirteen petty chiefs\r\nunder a British resident, and subsequently, in 1887, annexed to the\r\nBritish crown as a dependency, to be administered by the Governor of\r\nNatal. Except for some disturbances in 1888, its people have since\r\nremained peaceful, prosperous, and to all appearance contented. It has\r\nnow (1897) been decided to annex Zululand to Natal.\r\n\r\nWe may now return to follow the fortunes of the emigrant Boers of the\r\nfar north-eastern interior whose republic, recognized by the Imperial\r\nGovernment in 1852, was at length, after twenty-five years, to be\r\nbrought into a closer connection than ever with the British Colonies by\r\nevents which are still fresh in men's memories, and which are exerting a\r\npotent influence on the politics of our own time. The scale of these\r\nevents was small, but the circumstances are full of instruction, and\r\nmany years may yet elapse before their consequences have been fully\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch farmers who had settled beyond the Vaal River were more rude\r\nand uneducated than those of the Free State, had no admixture of English\r\nblood, and remained unaffected by intercourse with the more civilized\r\npeople of Cape Colony. Their love of independence was accompanied by a\r\ntendency to discord. Their warlike spirit had produced a readiness to\r\ntake up arms on slight occasions, and had degenerated into a fondness\r\nfor predatory expeditions. They were, moreover, always desirous of\r\nenlarging the area of their stock farms by the annexation of fresh\r\nterritory to the north and west, and thus were constantly brought into\r\ncollision with the native occupants of the country. Scattered thinly\r\nover a wide area of pasture land, they were practically exempt from the\r\ncontrol of law courts or magistrates, while at the same time the\r\nsmallness of their numbers, and the family ties which linked them into\r\njealous and mutually distrustful groups, gave rise to personal rivalries\r\namong the leaders and bitter feuds among the adherents of each faction,\r\nresembling those which used to distract a city republic in ancient\r\nGreece or medieval Italy. The absence of any effective government had\r\nattracted many adventurers from various parts of South Africa, who\r\nwandered as traders or hunters through the wilder parts of the country\r\nand along its borders, men often violent and reckless, who ill-treated\r\nthe natives, and constituted not only a public scandal, but, by the\r\nprovocations which they gave to the Kafir chiefs, a danger to the peace\r\nof the adjoining British territories, as well as to that of the\r\nTransvaal itself.\r\n\r\nFrom their first settlement beyond the Vaal in the years immediately\r\nfollowing the Great Trek of 1836, the farmers, though considering\r\nthemselves to form one people, had been grouped in several small\r\ncommunities. In 1852 there were four such, those of Potchefstroom,\r\nUtrecht, Lydenburg, and Zoutpansberg, each having its Volksraad\r\n(people's council) and president or executive head, while a sort of\r\nloosely federative tie linked them together for the purposes, not of\r\ninternal administration, but of defence against common foes.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the Potchefstroom people tried to conquer the Orange Free State,\r\nthen in the third year of its life, but desisted on finding that the\r\ninfant Republic was prepared to defend itself. A single Volksraad for\r\nall the communities beyond the Vaal had been chosen as far back as 1849;\r\nbut respect for authority grew very slowly, and for a time it could not\r\nbe said to represent more than a party. In 1852, however, it ratified\r\nthe Sand River Convention, and in 1855 it appointed a commission to\r\ndraft a complete body of law. Finally, in 1858, an instrument called the\r\n\"Grondwet,\" or Fundamental Law, was drawn up by a body of delegates\r\nnamed (by a \"Krygsraad,\" or War Council) for that purpose. This\r\ninstrument was revised and adopted by the Volksraad, and presently\r\nreceived the adhesion of two of the semi-independent communities, those\r\nof Potchestroom and Zoutpansberg, and in 1860 also of those at Lydenburg\r\nand Utrecht, which had by that time united. It has been since several\r\ntimes modified, and the question whether it is to be deemed a truly\r\nrigid constitution, like that of the United States or that of the Swiss\r\nConfederation, has given rise to much controversy.[25] A civil war broke\r\nout in 1862, and the country can hardly be said to have reached one\r\nunited government till 1864, when the then president, Mr. M. W.\r\nPretorius (son of the old antagonist of the English), was recognized by\r\nall the communities and factions as their executive head.\r\n\r\nEven in 1864 the white population of the South African Republic was very\r\nsmall, probably not more than 30,000 all told, giving an average of less\r\nthan one person to three square miles. There were, however, hundreds of\r\nthousands of natives, a few of whom were living as servants, under a\r\nsystem of enforced labour which was sometimes hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom slavery, while the vast majority were ruled by their own chiefs,\r\nsome as tributaries of the Republic, some practically independent of it.\r\nWith the latter wars were frequently raging--wars in which shocking\r\ncruelties were perpetrated on both sides, the Kafirs massacring the\r\nwhite families whom they surprised, the Boer commandos taking a savage\r\nvengeance upon the tribes when they captured a kraal or mountain\r\nstronghold. It was the sight of these wars which drove Dr. Livingstone\r\nto begin his famous explorations to the north. The farmers were too few\r\nto reduce the natives to submission, though always able to defeat them\r\nin the field, and while they relished an expedition, they had an\r\ninvincible dislike to any protracted operations which cost money. Taxes\r\nthey would not pay. They lived in a sort of rude plenty among their\r\nsheep and cattle, but they had hardly any coined money, conducting their\r\ntransactions by barter, and they were too rude to value the benefits\r\nwhich government secures to a civilized people. Accordingly the treasury\r\nremained almost empty, the paper money which was issued fell till in\r\n1870 it was worth only one-fourth of its face value, no public\r\nimprovements were made, no proper administration existed, and every man\r\ndid what was right in his own eyes. In 1872 Mr. M. W. Pretorius was\r\nobliged to resign the presidency, owing to the unpopularity he had\r\nincurred by accepting the arbitration mentioned above (p. 144), which\r\ndeclared the piece of territory where diamonds had been found not to\r\nbelong to the Republic, and which the Volksraad thereupon repudiated.\r\nHis successor was Mr. Burgers, a Cape Dutchman who had formerly been a\r\nclergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church and afterwards an advocate at the\r\nCape, a man of energy, integrity, and eloquence, but deficient in\r\npractical judgment, and who soon became distrusted on account of his\r\ntheological opinions. It used to be jestingly said that the Boers\r\ndisliked him because he denied that the devil possessed that tail which\r\nis shown in the pictures that adorn the old Dutch Bibles; but his\r\ndeviations from orthodoxy went much further than this, and were deemed\r\nby the people to be the cause of the misfortunes they experienced under\r\nhis guidance. He formed large plans for the development of the country\r\nand the extension of Boer power over South Africa, plans which his\r\ncitizens were unable to appreciate and the resources at his disposal\r\nwere quite unfit to accomplish. Disorganization, aggravated by intestine\r\nfaction, grew worse and worse. The State was practically bankrupt; trade\r\nhad ceased, money could not be raised. In 1876, in a war which had\r\nbroken out with Sikukuni, a Kafir chief who lived in the mountains of\r\nthe north-east, the Boers were repulsed, and ultimately returned in\r\nconfusion to their homes. On the south, Cetewayo, then in the zenith of\r\nhis power, was unfriendly, and seemed likely to pour in his Zulu hordes.\r\nThe weakness and disorders of the Republic had become a danger not only\r\nto the British subjects who had begun to settle in it, especially at the\r\nLydenburg gold mines, but also to the neighbouring British territories,\r\nand especially to Natal; so a British commissioner was sent to examine\r\ninto the condition of the country, with secret instructions empowering\r\nhim to proclaim, if he should deem it necessary, and if he was satisfied\r\nthat the majority of the inhabitants would approve, its annexation to\r\nthe British crown. After three months' inquiry the commissioner, Sir\r\nTheophilus Shepstone, exercised this power upon April 12, 1877, and his\r\nact was approved by the High Commissioner at the Cape and by the\r\nColonial Secretary in England. President Burgers had endeavoured to\r\nrouse his people by pointing out that only through reforms could they\r\npreserve their independence. They agreed to the reforms, but would not\r\nhelp him to carry them out, and obstinately refused to pay taxes. He was\r\nhelpless, for while the more rigidly Calvinistic section of the\r\npopulation supported Paul Kruger, his opponent in the approaching\r\npresidential election, others (especially the English who had settled in\r\nthe spots where a little gold had been found) favoured annexation to\r\nGreat Britain, and most of the Boers had been repelled by his unorthodox\r\nopinions. Accordingly, after entering a protest against the annexation,\r\nhe returned to Cape Colony, and received a pension, his private means\r\nhaving been entirely spent in the service of his country.[26] The\r\nVice-President (Mr. Kruger) and the executive council of the Republic\r\nalso protested, and sent delegates to London to remonstrate. By the mass\r\nof the Boer people--for the few English, of course, approved--little\r\ndispleasure was shown and no resistance made. Had a popular vote been\r\ntaken it would doubtless have been adverse to annexation, for a memorial\r\ncirculated shortly afterwards, praying for a reversal of Sir T.\r\nShepstone's act, received the signatures of a large majority of the Boer\r\ncitizens.[27] But while they regretted their independence, they had been\r\nso much depressed by their disasters, and were so much relieved to know\r\nthat the strong arm of Britain would now repel any Kafir invasion, as to\r\ntake the change more quietly than any one who remembered their earlier\r\nhistory would have expected.\r\n\r\nOn the English public, which knew little and cared less about South\r\nAfrican affairs, the news that their empire had been extended by a\r\nterritory nearly as large as the United Kingdom, though it came as a\r\ncomplete surprise, produced little impression. They were then excited\r\nover the outbreak of the war between Russia and the Turks, and absorbed\r\nin the keen party struggles which Lord Beaconsfield's apparent desire to\r\nhelp the Turks had caused in England, so that scant attention was given\r\nto a distant colonial question. A motion condemning the annexation which\r\nwas brought forward in the House of Commons received no support. Nearly\r\nall of those few persons who cared about South Africa had been alienated\r\nfrom the Boers by their treatment of the natives. Scarcely any one\r\nforesaw the long series of troubles, not yet ended, to which the\r\nannexation was destined to give rise. Neither did it arouse any serious\r\nopposition in Cape Colony, though the Dutch element there regarded with\r\nmisgivings the withdrawal of independence from their emigrant kinsfolk.\r\n\r\nTo those who now look back at the act, in the light of the events which\r\nfollowed, it seems a high-handed proceeding to extinguish a Republic\r\nwhich had been formally recognized twenty-five years before, and to do\r\nthis without giving the people an opportunity of declaring their wishes.\r\nYet the act was not done in a spirit of rapacity. Neither the British\r\ngovernment nor the British people had the least idea of the wealth that\r\nlay hidden beneath the barren and desolate ridges of the Witwatersrand.\r\nNo one in England talked (though the notion had crossed a few ambitious\r\nminds) of pushing British dominion up to the Zambesi. The Transvaal\r\nRepublic was bankrupt and helpless, distracted by internal quarrels,\r\nunable to collect any taxes, apparently unable to defend itself against\r\nits Kafir enemies, and likely to be the cause of native troubles which\r\nmight probably spread till they affected all Europeans in South Africa.\r\nThere was some reason to believe that the citizens, though they had not\r\nbeen consulted, would soon acquiesce in the change, especially when they\r\nfound, as they soon did find, that the value of property rose with the\r\nprospect of security and of the carrying out of internal improvements by\r\na strong and wealthy power. Such was certainly the belief of Sir T.\r\nShepstone and of Lord Carnarvon, and it seemed to be confirmed by the\r\napparent tranquillity which the Boers exhibited.\r\n\r\nSo, indeed, they might have acquiesced notwithstanding their strenuous\r\nlove of independence, had they been wisely dealt with. But the British\r\ngovernment proceeded forthwith to commit three capital blunders.\r\n\r\nThe first of these, and the least excusable, was the failure to grant\r\nthat local autonomy which Sir T. Shepstone had announced when he\r\nproclaimed annexation. The Volksraad which the people were promised was\r\nnever convoked; the constitution under which they were to enjoy\r\nself-government was never promulgated. There was no intention to break\r\nthese promises, but merely a delay, culpable, indeed, but due to\r\nignorance of the popular Boer sentiment, and to the desire of the\r\nColonial Office to carry out its pet scheme of South African\r\nconfederation before conceding to the Transvaal such a representative\r\nassembly as would have had the power to reject, on behalf of the people,\r\nthe scheme when tendered to them. Nor were matters mended when at last a\r\nlegislature was granted, to consist of some officials, and of six\r\nmembers nominated by the Governor, for this made the people fear that a\r\ngenuine freely elected Volksraad would never be conceded at all.\r\n\r\nThe second blunder was the selection of the person who was to administer\r\nthe country. Sir T. Shepstone, who knew it well and was liked by the\r\nBoers, was replaced by a military officer who had shown vigour in\r\ndealing with local disturbances in Griqualand West, but was totally\r\nunfit for delicate political work. As representative government had not\r\nyet been introduced, his administration was necessarily autocratic in\r\nform, and became autocratic in spirit also. He was described to me by\r\nsome who knew him as stiff in mind and arrogant in temper, incapable of\r\nmaking allowances for the homely manners of the Boers and of adapting\r\nhimself to the social equality which prevailed among them. A trifling\r\ncause aggravated their dislike. His complexion was swarthy, and they\r\nsuspected that this might be due to some tinge of negro blood. He\r\nrefused to listen to their complaints, levied taxes strictly, causing\r\neven the beloved ox-waggon to be seized when money was not forthcoming,\r\nand soon turned their smouldering discontent into active disaffection.\r\n\r\nFinally, the British government removed the two native dangers which the\r\nBoers had feared. In 1879 Sir Bartle Frere's war with Cetewayo destroyed\r\nthe Zulu power, the dread of which might have induced the Boers to\r\nresign themselves to British supremacy, and an expedition under Sir\r\nGarnet Wolseley reduced Sikukuni's strongholds and established peace in\r\nthe north-east. It was probably necessary to deal with Sikukuni, though\r\nthe British government seems to have forgotten its former doubts as to\r\nthe right of the Boers to the territory of that chief; but in\r\nextinguishing the Zulu kingdom the High Commissioner overlooked the fact\r\nthat he was also extinguishing the strongest motive which the\r\nrepublicans had for remaining British subjects. The British government\r\nwere doubly unfortunate. It was the annexation of the Transvaal in 1877\r\nthat had alarmed Cetewayo and helped to precipitate the war of 1879. It\r\nwas now the overthrow of Cetewayo, their formidable enemy, that helped\r\nto precipitate a revolt of the Boers.\r\n\r\nAt this time, however, everybody in British South Africa, and nearly\r\neverybody in England, supposed the annexation to be irrevocable. Leading\r\nmembers of the parliamentary Opposition had condemned it. But when that\r\nOpposition, victorious in the general election of 1880, took office in\r\nApril of that year, the officials in South Africa, whose guidance they\r\nsought, made light of Boer discontent, and declared that it would be\r\nimpossible now to undo what had been done in 1877. Thus misled, the new\r\nCabinet refused to reverse the annexation, saying by the mouth of the\r\nUnder Secretary for the Colonies, \"_Fieri non debuit, factum valet_.\"\r\nThis decision of the British government, which came as a surprise upon\r\nthe recalcitrant republicans in the Transvaal, precipitated an outbreak.\r\nIn December, 1880, a mass-meeting of the Boers was held at a place\r\ncalled Paardekraal (now Krugersdorp). It was resolved to rise in arms;\r\nand a triumvirate was elected, consisting of Messrs. M.W. Pretorius,\r\nKruger and Joubert, which proclaimed the re-establishment of the South\r\nAfrican Republic, and hoisted the national flag on Dingaan's day,\r\nDecember 16.[28] The Boers, nearly every man of whom was accustomed to\r\nfighting, now rose _en masse_ and attacked the small detachments of\r\nBritish troops scattered through the country, some of which were cut\r\noff, while the rest were obliged to retire to posts which they\r\nfortified. The Governor of Natal, General Sir George Colley, raised what\r\ntroops he could in that Colony, and marched northward; but before he\r\ncould reach the Transvaal border a strong force of Boers, commanded by\r\nCommandant-General Joubert, crossed it and took up a position at Laing's\r\nNek, a steep ridge close to the watershed between the upper waters of\r\nthe Klip River, a tributary of the Vaal, and those of the Buffalo River,\r\nwhich joins the Tugela and flows into the Indian Ocean. Here the British\r\ngeneral, on January 28, 1881, attacked the Boers, but was repulsed with\r\nheavy loss, for the ridge behind which they were posted protected them\r\nfrom his artillery, while their accurate rifle fire cut down his column\r\nas it mounted the slope. A second engagement, eleven days later, on the\r\nIngogo heights, caused severe loss to the British troops. Finally, on\r\nthe night of February 26, General Colley, with a small detachment,\r\nseized by night Majuba Hill, a mountain which rises about 1500 feet\r\nabove Laing's Nek, and completely commands that pass.[29] Unfortunately\r\nhe omitted to direct the main force, which he had left behind at his\r\ncamp, four miles south of the Nek, to advance against the Boers and\r\noccupy their attention; so the latter, finding no movement made against\r\nthem in front, and receiving no artillery fire from Majuba Hill above\r\nthem, checked the first impulse to retire, which the sight of British\r\ntroops on the hilltop had produced, and sent out a volunteer party to\r\nscale the hill. Protected by the steep declivities from the fire of the\r\nsoldiers above them, they made their way up, shooting down those whom\r\nthey saw against the sky-line, and finally routed the British force,\r\nkilling General Colley, with ninety-one others, and taking fifty-nine\r\nprisoners. By this time fresh troops were beginning to arrive in Natal,\r\nand before long the British general who had succeeded to the command had\r\nat his disposal a force which the Boers could not possibly have\r\nresisted. The home government, however, had ordered an armistice to be\r\nconcluded (March 5), and on March 23 terms were agreed to by which the\r\n\"Transvaal State\" (as it was called) was again recognized as a\r\nquasi-independent political community, to enjoy complete self-government\r\nunder the suzerainty of the British crown. These terms were developed in\r\na more formal convention, signed at Pretoria in August, 1881, which\r\nrecognized the Transvaal as autonomous, subject, however, to the\r\nsuzerainty of the Queen, to British control in matters of foreign\r\npolicy, to the obligation to allow British troops to pass through the\r\nRepublic in time of war, and to guarantees for the protection of the\r\nnatives.[30] The position in which the Transvaal thus found itself\r\nplaced was a peculiar one, and something between that of a\r\nself-governing Colony and an absolutely independent State. The nearest\r\nlegal parallel is to be found in the position of some of the great\r\nfeudatories of the British crown in India, but the actual circumstances\r\nwere of course too unlike those of India to make the parallel\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\nFew public acts of our time have been the subjects of more prolonged and\r\nacrimonious controversy than this reversal in 1881 of the annexation of\r\n1877. The British government were at the time accused, both by the\r\nEnglish element in the South African Colonies, and by their political\r\nopponents at home, of an ignominious surrender. They had, so it was\r\nurged, given way to rebellion. They had allowed three defeats to remain\r\nunavenged. They had weakly yielded to force what they had repeatedly and\r\nsolemnly refused to peaceful petitions. They had disregarded the pledges\r\ngiven both to Englishmen and to natives in the Transvaal. They had done\r\nall this for a race of men who had been uniformly harsh and unjust to\r\nthe Kafirs, who had brought their own Republic to bankruptcy and chaos\r\nby misgovernment, who were and would remain foes of the British empire,\r\nwho were incapable of appreciating magnanimity, and would construe\r\nforbearance as cowardice. They had destroyed the prestige of British\r\npower in Africa among whites and blacks, and thereby sowed for\r\nthemselves and their successors a crop of future difficulties.\r\n\r\nTo these arguments it was replied that the annexation had been made, and\r\nthe earlier refusals to reverse it pronounced, under a complete\r\nmisapprehension as to the facts. The representatives of the Colonial\r\nOffice in South Africa had reported, partly through insufficient\r\nknowledge, partly because their views were influenced by their feelings,\r\nthat there was no such passion for independence among the Boers as\r\nevents had shown to exist.[31] Once the true facts were known, did it\r\nnot become not merely unjust to deprive the Transvaal people of the\r\nfreedom they prized so highly, but also impolitic to retain by force\r\nthose who would have been disaffected and troublesome subjects? A free\r\nnation which professes to be everywhere the friend of freedom is\r\nbound--so it was argued--to recognize the principles it maintains even\r\nwhen they work against itself; and if these considerations went to show\r\nthat the retrocession of the Transvaal was a proper course, was it\r\neither wise or humane to prolong the war and crush the Boer resistance\r\nat the cost of much slaughter, merely in order to avenge defeats and\r\nvindicate a military superiority which the immensely greater forces of\r\nBritain made self-evident? A great country is strong enough to be\r\nmagnanimous, and shows her greatness better by justice and lenity than\r\nby a sanguinary revenge. These moral arguments, which affect different\r\nminds differently, were reinforced by a strong ground of policy. The\r\nBoers of the Orange Free State had sympathised warmly with their\r\nkinsfolk in the Transvaal, and were with difficulty kept from crossing\r\nthe border to join them. The President of the Free State, a sagacious\r\nman, anxious to secure peace, had made himself prominent as a mediator,\r\nbut it was not certain that his citizens might not, even against his\r\nadvice, join in the fighting. Among the Africander Dutch of Cape Colony\r\nand Natal the feeling for the Transvaal Boers was hardly less strong,\r\nand the accentuation of Dutch sentiment, caused by the events of 1880\r\nand 1881, has ever since been a main factor in the politics of Cape\r\nColony. The British government were advised from the Cape that the\r\ninvasion of the Transvaal might probably light up a civil war through\r\nthe two Colonies. The power of Great Britain would of course have\r\nprevailed, even against the whole Dutch-speaking population of South\r\nAfrica; but it would have prevailed only after much bloodshed, and at\r\nthe cost of an intense embitterment of feeling, which would have\r\ndestroyed the prospects of the peace and welfare of the two Colonies\r\nfor many years to come. The loss of the Transvaal seemed a slight evil\r\nin comparison.\r\n\r\nWhether such a race conflict would in fact have broken out all over\r\nSouth Africa is a question on which opinion is still divided, and about\r\nwhich men may dispute for ever. The British government, however, deemed\r\nthe risk of it a real one, and by that view their action was mainly\r\ngoverned. After careful inquiries from those best qualified to judge, I\r\nam inclined to think that they were right. It must, however, be admitted\r\nthat the event belied some of their hopes. They had expected that the\r\nTransvaal people would appreciate the generosity of the retrocession, as\r\nwell as the humanity which was willing to forgo vengeance for the\r\ntarnished lustre of British arms. The Boers, however, saw neither\r\ngenerosity nor humanity in their conduct, but only fear. Jubilant over\r\ntheir victories, and (like the Kafirs in the South Coast wars) not\r\nrealizing the overwhelming force which could have been brought against\r\nthem, they fancied themselves entitled to add some measure of contempt\r\nto the dislike they already cherished to the English, and they have ever\r\nsince shown themselves unpleasant neighbours. The English in South\r\nAfrica, on their part, have continued to resent the concession of\r\nindependence to the Transvaal, and especially the method in which it was\r\nconceded. Those who had recently settled in the Republic, relying on the\r\ndeclarations repeatedly made that it would for ever remain British,\r\ncomplained that no proper compensation was made to them, and that they\r\nhad much to suffer from the Boers. Those who live in the two Colonies\r\nhold that the disgrace (as they term it) of Majuba Hill ought to have\r\nbeen wiped out by a march to Pretoria, and that the Boers should have\r\nbeen made to recognize that Britain is, and will remain, the paramount\r\npower in fact as well as in name. They feel aggrieved to this day that\r\nthe terms of peace were settled at Laing's Nek, within the territory of\r\nNatal, while it was still held by the Boers. Even in Cape Colony, where\r\nthe feeling is perhaps less strong than it is in Natal, the average\r\nEnglishman has neither forgotten nor forgiven the events of 1881.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt fully upon these events because they are, next to the Great\r\nTrek of 1836, the most important in the internal history of South\r\nAfrica, and those which have most materially affected the present\r\npolitical situation. The few years that followed may be more briefly\r\ndismissed. The Transvaal State emerged from its war of independence\r\npenniless and unorganized, but with a redoubled sense of Divine favour\r\nand a reinvigorated consciousness of national life. The old constitution\r\nwas set to work; the Volksraad again met; Mr. Stephen John Paul Kruger,\r\nwho had been the leading figure in the triumvirate, was chosen by the\r\npeople to be President, and has subsequently been thrice re-elected to\r\nthat office. Undismayed by the scantiness of his State resources, he\r\nformed bold and far-reaching plans of advance on the three sides which\r\nlay open to him. To the north a trek was projected, and some years later\r\nwas nearly carried out, for the occupation of Mashonaland. To the south\r\nbands of Boer adventurers entered Zululand, the first of them as\r\ntrekkers, the rest as auxiliaries to one of the native chiefs, who were\r\nat war with one another. These adventurers established a sort of\r\nrepublic in the northern districts, and would probably have seized the\r\nwhole had not the British government at last interfered and confined\r\nthem to a territory of nearly three thousand square miles, which was\r\nrecognized in 1886 under the name of the New Republic, and which in 1888\r\nmerged itself in the Transvaal. To the west, other bands of Boer raiders\r\nentered Bechuanaland, seized land or obtained grants of land by the\r\nusual devices, required the chiefs to acknowledge their supremacy, and\r\nproceeded to establish two petty republics, one called Stellaland,\r\nround the village of Vryburg, north of Kimberley, and the other,\r\nfarther north, called Goshen. These violent proceedings, which were not\r\nonly injurious to the natives, but were obviously part of a plan to add\r\nBechuanaland to the Transvaal territories, and close against the English\r\nthe path to those northern regions in which Britain was already\r\ninterested, roused the British Government. In the end of 1884 an\r\nexpedition led by Sir Charles Warren entered Bechuanaland. The\r\nfreebooters of the two Republics retired before it, and the districts\r\nthey had occupied were erected into a Crown Colony under the name of\r\nBritish Bechuanaland. In 1895 this territory was annexed to Cape Colony.\r\nIn order to prevent the Boers from playing the same game in the country\r\nstill farther north, where their aggressions had so far back as 1876 led\r\nKhama, chief of the Bamangwato, to ask for British protection, a British\r\nprotectorate was proclaimed (March, 1885) over the whole country as far\r\nas the borders of Matabililand; and a few years later, in 1888, a treaty\r\nwas concluded with Lo Bengula, the Matabili king, whereby he undertook\r\nnot to cede territory to, or make a treaty with, any foreign power\r\nwithout the consent of the British High Commissioner. The west was thus\r\nsecured against the further advance of the Boers, while on the eastern\r\nshore the hoisting of the British flag at St. Lucia Bay in 1884 (a spot\r\nalready ceded by Panda in 1843), followed by the conclusion (in 1887) of\r\na treaty with the Tonga chiefs, by which they undertook not to make any\r\ntreaty with any other power, announced the resolution of the British\r\ncrown to hold the coast line up to the Portuguese territories.\r\n\r\nThis policy of preventing the extension of Boer dominion over the\r\nnatives was, however, accompanied by a willingness to oblige the\r\nTransvaal people in other ways. Though they had not observed the\r\nconditions of the Convention of 1881, the Boers had continued to\r\nimportune the British government for an ampler measure of independence.\r\nIn 1884 they succeeded in inducing Lord Derby, then Colonial Secretary,\r\nto agree to a new Convention, which thereafter defined the relations\r\nbetween the British crown and the South African Republic, a title now at\r\nlast formally conceded. By this instrument (called the Convention of\r\nLondon),[32] whose articles were substituted for the articles of the\r\nConvention of 1881, the control of foreign policy stipulated for in the\r\nPretoria Convention of 1881 was cut down to a provision that the\r\nRepublic should \"conclude no treaty with any State or nation other than\r\nthe Orange Free State, nor with any native tribe to the eastward or\r\nwestward of the Republic,\" without the approval of the Queen. The\r\ndeclarations of the two previous Conventions (of 1852 and 1881) against\r\nslavery were renewed, and there was a \"most favoured nation\" clause with\r\nprovisions for the good treatment of strangers entering the Republic.\r\nNothing was said as to the \"suzerainty of her Majesty\" mentioned in the\r\nConvention of 1881. The Boers have contended that this omission is\r\nequivalent to a renunciation, but to this it has been (among other\r\nthings) replied that as that suzerainty was recognized not in the\r\n\"articles\" of the instrument of 1881, but in its introductory paragraph,\r\nit has not been renounced, and still subsists.[33]\r\n\r\nA few years later, the amity which this Convention was meant to secure\r\nwas endangered by the plan formed by a body of Boer farmers and\r\nadventurers to carry out an idea previously formed by Mr. Kruger, and\r\ntrek northward into the country beyond the Limpopo River, a country\r\nwhere the natives were feeble and disunited, raided on one side by the\r\nMatabili and on the other by Gungunhana. This trek would have brought\r\nthe emigrants into collision with the English settlers who had shortly\r\nbefore entered Mashonaland. President Kruger, however, being pressed by\r\nthe imperial government, undertook to check the movement, and so far\r\nsucceeded that the waggons which crossed the Limpopo were but few and\r\nwere easily turned back. Prevented from expanding to the north, the\r\nBoers were all the more eager to acquire Swaziland, a small but rich\r\nterritory which lies to the east of their Republic, and is inhabited by\r\na warlike Kafir race, numbering about 70,000, near of kin to the Zulus,\r\nbut for many years hostile to them. Both the Boers and Cetewayo had\r\nformerly claimed supremacy over this region. The British government had\r\nnever admitted the Boer claim, but when the head chief of the Swazis\r\nhad, by a series of improvident concessions, granted away to\r\nadventurers, most of them Boers, nearly all the best land and minerals\r\nthe country contained, it was found extremely difficult to continue the\r\nsystem of joint administration by the High Commissioner and the\r\nTransvaal government which had been provisionally established, and all\r\nthe more difficult because by the concession to the New Republic (which\r\nhad by this time become incorporated with the Transvaal) of the part of\r\nZululand which adjoined Swaziland, direct communication between Natal\r\nand Swaziland had become difficult, especially in the malarious season.\r\nAccordingly, after long negotiations, an arrangement was concluded, in\r\n1894, which placed the Swazi nation and territory under the control of\r\nthe South African Republic, subject to full guarantees for the\r\nprotection of the natives. A previous Convention (of 1890) had given the\r\nSouth African Republic certain rights of making a railway to the coast\r\nat Kosi Bay through the low and malarious region which lies between\r\nSwaziland and the sea, and the earlier negotiations had proceeded on the\r\nassumption that these rights were to be adjusted and renewed in the same\r\ninstrument which was destined to settle the Swaziland question. The\r\nBoer government, however, ultimately declined to include such an\r\nadjustment in the new Convention, and as this new Convention superseded\r\nand extinguished the former one of 1890, those provisions for access to\r\nthe sea necessarily lapsed. The British government promptly availed\r\nitself of the freedom its rivals had thus tendered to it, and with the\r\nconsent of the three chiefs (of Tonga race) who rule in the region\r\nreferred to, proclaimed a protectorate over the strip of land which lies\r\nbetween Swaziland and the sea, as far north as the frontiers of\r\nPortuguese territory. Thus the door has been finally closed on the\r\nschemes which the Boers have so often sought to carry out for the\r\nacquisition of a railway communication with the coast entirely under\r\ntheir own control. It was an object unfavourable to the interests of the\r\nparamount power, for it would not only have disturbed the commercial\r\nrelations of the interior with the British coast ports, but would also\r\nhave favoured the wish of the Boer government to establish political\r\nties with other European powers. The accomplishment of that design was\r\nno doubt subjected by the London Convention of 1884 to the veto of\r\nBritain. But in diplomacy facts as well as treaties have their force,\r\nand a Power which has a seaport, and can fly a flag on the ocean, is in\r\na very different position from one cut off by intervening territories\r\nfrom those whose support it is supposed to seek. Thus the establishment\r\nof the protectorate over these petty Tonga chiefs may be justly deemed\r\none of the most important events in recent South African history.\r\n\r\nDown to 1884 Great Britain and Portugal had been the only European\r\npowers established in South Africa. For some time before that year there\r\nhad been German mission stations in parts of the region which lies\r\nbetween the Orange River and the West African possessions of Portugal,\r\nand in 1883 a Bremen merchant named Lüderitz established a trading\r\nfactory at the bay of Angra Pequeña, which lies on the Atlantic coast\r\nabout one hundred and fifty miles north of the mouth of that river, and\r\nobtained from a neighbouring chief a cession of a piece of territory\r\nthere, which the German government a few months later recognized as a\r\nGerman Colony. Five years earlier, in 1878, Walfish Bay, which lies\r\nfarther north, and is the best haven (or rather roadstead) on the coast,\r\nhad been annexed to Cape Colony; but though it was generally understood\r\nboth in the Colony and in England, that the whole of the west coast up\r\nto the Portuguese boundary was in some vague way subject to British\r\ninfluence, nothing had been done to claim any distinct right, much less\r\nto perfect that right by occupation. The Colony had always declined or\r\nomitted to vote money for the purpose, and the home government had not\r\ncared to spend any. When the colonists knew that Germany was really\r\nestablishing herself as their neighbour on the north, they were much\r\nannoyed; but it was now too late to resist, and in 1884, after a long\r\ncorrespondence, not creditable to the foresight or promptitude of the\r\nlate Lord Derby, who was then Colonial Secretary, the protectorate of\r\nGermany was formally recognized, while in 1890 the boundaries of the\r\nGerman and British \"spheres of influence\" farther north were defined by\r\na formal agreement--the same agreement which settled the respective\r\n\"spheres of influence\" of the two powers in Eastern Africa, between the\r\nZambesi and the upper Nile. Although the people of Cape Colony continue\r\nto express their regret at having a great European power conterminous\r\nwith them on the north, there has been really little or no practical\r\ncontact between the Germans and the colonists, for while the northern\r\npart of the Colony, lying along the lower course of the Orange River, is\r\nso arid as to be very thinly peopled, the southern part of the German\r\nterritory, called Great Namaqualand, is a wilderness inhabited only by\r\nwandering Hottentots (though parts of it are good pasture land), while,\r\nto the east, Namaqualand is separated from the habitable parts of\r\nBritish Bechuanaland by the great Kalahari Desert.\r\n\r\nThe new impulse for colonial expansion which had prompted the Germans to\r\noccupy Damaraland and the Cameroons on the western, and the Zanzibar\r\ncoasts on the eastern, side of Africa was now telling on other European\r\npowers, and made them all join in the scramble for Africa, a continent\r\nwhich a few years before had been deemed worthless. Italy and France\r\nentered the field in the north-east, France in the north-west; and\r\nBritain, which had in earlier days moved with such slow and wavering\r\nsteps in the far south, was roused by the competition to a swifter\r\nadvance. Within nine years from the assumption of the protectorate over\r\nBritish Bechuanaland, which the action of the Boers had brought about in\r\n1885, the whole unappropriated country up to the Zambesi came under\r\nBritish control.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 a treaty made with Lo Bengula extended the range of British\r\ninfluence and claim not only over Matabililand proper, but over\r\nMashonaland and an undefined territory to the eastward, whereof Lo\r\nBengula claimed to be suzerain. Next came, in 1889, the grant of a royal\r\ncharter to a company, known as the British South Africa Company, which\r\nhad been formed to develop this eastern side of Lo Bengula's dominion,\r\nand to work the gold mines believed to exist there, an undertaking\r\nchiefly due to the bold and forceful spirit of Mr. Cecil Rhodes, who\r\nperceived that if Britain did not speedily establish some right to the\r\ncountry, the Transvaal Boers would trek in and acquire it. In 1890 the\r\npioneer British settlers moved up through Bechuanaland into Mashonaland,\r\nand the Company, which, like the East India Company of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, was to be a ruling and administering power as well as a trading\r\nassociation, established itself along the eastern part of the great\r\nplateau and began to build forts. Here it came into collision with the\r\nPortuguese, who, stimulated by the activity of other nations, had been\r\nre-asserting their dormant claims to the interior and sending up\r\nexpeditions to occupy the country. A skirmish which occurred near\r\nMassikessi, in Manicaland, ended in the repulse of the Portuguese, and\r\nthe capture of their commanders, who were, however, soon after released\r\nby Dr. Jameson, the newly appointed administrator of the Company; and\r\nanother conflict in May, 1891, in which the Portuguese again suffered\r\nseverely, hastened the conclusion of a treaty (June, 1891) between Great\r\nBritain and Portugal, by which the boundary between the Portuguese\r\nterritories and those included in the British \"sphere of influence\" was\r\nfixed. By this treaty a vast region in the interior which lies along the\r\nUpper Zambesi west of Portuguese territory and south of the Congo Free\r\nState was recognized by Portugal as within the British sphere. An\r\nagreement of the preceding year between Germany and Great Britain (July\r\n1, 1890) had defined the limits of German and British influence on the\r\neast side of the continent; and as Germany, Portugal, and the Congo\r\nState were the only civilized powers conterminous with Great Britain in\r\nthis part of the world, these treaties, together with the instrument--to\r\nwhich Great Britain had been a party--that determined the limits of the\r\nCongo State, settled finally all these questions of the interior, and\r\ngave to Great Britain a legal title to her share of it.\r\n\r\nThat title, however, like the other titles by which the European powers\r\nheld their new African possessions, was a paper title, and valid only as\r\nagainst other neighbouring European powers. It had nothing whatever to\r\ndo with the Kafir tribes who dwelt in the country. What are called the\r\nrights of a civilized Power as against the natives rests in some cases\r\nupon treaties made with the chiefs, treaties of whose effect the chiefs\r\nare often ignorant, and in others on the mere will of the European power\r\nwhich proclaims to the world that it claims the country; and it is held\r\nthat the Power which makes the claim must, at least in the latter class\r\nof cases, perfect its claim by actual occupation. In the case of these\r\nnew British territories treaties were made with a certain number of\r\nchiefs. One already existed with Lo Bengula, king of the Matabili; but\r\nit merely bound him not to league himself with any other power, and did\r\nnot make him a British vassal. It was clear, however, that with so\r\nrestless and warlike a race as the Matabili this state of things could\r\nnot last long. Lo Bengula had been annoyed at the march of the pioneers\r\ninto Mashonaland, and tried to stop them, but was foiled by the\r\nswiftness of their movements. Once they were established there he seems\r\nto have desired to keep the peace; but his young warriors would not\r\nsuffer him to do so. They had been accustomed to go raiding among the\r\nfeeble and disunited Mashonas, whom they slaughtered and plundered to\r\ntheir hearts' content. When they found that the Company resented these\r\nattacks, collisions occurred, and the reluctance to fight which Lo\r\nBengula probably felt counted for little. What he could do he did: he\r\nprotected with scrupulous care not only the missionaries, but other\r\nEuropeans at his kraal, and, after the war had broken out, he sent\r\nenvoys to treat, two of whom, by a deplorable error, were killed by the\r\nadvancing column of Bechuanaland imperial police, for as the Company's\r\nofficers were not at the moment prepared, either in money or in men, for\r\na conflict, the imperial government sent a force northward from\r\nBechuanaland to co-operate with that which the Company had in\r\nMashonaland. A raid by Matabili warriors on the Mashonas living near\r\nFort Victoria, whom they called their slaves, precipitated hostilities\r\n(July to October, 1893). The Matabili, whose vain confidence in their\r\nown prowess led them to attack in the open when they ought to have\r\nresorted to bush fighting, were defeated in two battles by the Company's\r\nmen. Lo Bengula fled towards the Zambesi and died there (January, 1894)\r\nof fever and despair, as Shere Ali Khan had died when chased out of\r\nKabul by the British in 1878; while his indunas and the bulk of the\r\nMatabili people submitted with little further resistance. Matabililand\r\nwas now occupied by the Company, which shortly afterwards took\r\npossession of the northern part of its sphere of operations by running a\r\ntelegraph wire across the Zambesi and by placing officers on the shore\r\nof Lake Tanganyika. In March, 1896, the Matabili and some of the Mashona\r\nchiefs revolted, but after five months' fighting, in which many lives\r\nwere lost, peace was restored, and the subsequent construction of two\r\nrailways into the heart of the country of these tribes has given a\r\ngreat, if not complete, security against a renewal of like troubles.[34]\r\n\r\nBy the establishment of the British South Africa Company to the north of\r\nthe Transvaal that State had now become inclosed in British territory on\r\nevery side except the east; nor could it advance to Delagoa Bay, because\r\nPortugal was bound by the Arbitration Treaty of 1872 to allow Great\r\nBritain a right of pre-emption over her territory there. Meantime new\r\nforces had begun to work within the Republic. Between 1867 and 1872 gold\r\nhad been found in several places on the eastern side of the country, but\r\nin quantities so small that no one attached much importance to the\r\ndiscovery. After 1882, however, it began to be pretty largely worked. In\r\n1885 the conglomerate or _banket_ beds of the Witwatersrand were\r\ndiscovered,[35] and the influx of strangers, which had been considerable\r\nfrom 1882 onward, increased immensely, till in 1895 the number of recent\r\nimmigrants, most of whom were adult males, had risen to a number\r\n(roughly estimated at 100,000) largely exceeding that of the whole Boer\r\npopulation. Although the first result of the working of the gold mines\r\nand the growth of the towns had been to swell the revenues of the\r\npreviously impecunious Republic, President Kruger and the Boers\r\ngenerally were alarmed at seeing a tide of aliens from the British\r\ncolonies and Europe and the United States, most of them British\r\nsubjects, and nearly all speaking English, rise up around and threaten\r\nto submerge them. They proceeded to defend themselves by restricting the\r\nelectoral franchise, which had theretofore been easily acquirable by\r\nimmigrants. Laws were passed which, by excluding the newcomers, kept the\r\nnative Boer element in a safe majority; and even when in 1890 a\r\nconcession was made by the creation of a second Legislative Chamber,\r\nbased on a more extended franchise, its powers were carefully\r\nrestricted, and the election not only of the First Raad (the principal\r\nChamber), but also of the President and Executive Council, remained\r\nconfined to those who had full citizenship under the previous statutes.\r\nDiscontent spread among the new-comers, who complained both of their\r\nexclusion from political rights and of various grievances which they and\r\nthe mining industry suffered at the hands of the government. A reform\r\nassociation was formed in 1892. In 1894 the visit of the British High\r\nCommissioner, who had come from the Cape to negotiate with the President\r\non Swaziland and other pending questions, led to a vehement pro-British\r\nand anti-Boer demonstration at Pretoria, and thenceforward feeling ran\r\nhigh at Johannesburg, the new centre of the Rand mining district and of\r\nthe immigrant population. Finally, in December, 1895, a rising took\r\nplace at Johannesburg, the circumstances attending which must be set\r\nforth in the briefest way, for the uncontroverted facts are fresh in\r\nevery one's recollection, while an attempt to discuss the controverted\r\nones would lead me from the field of history into that of contemporary\r\npolitics.[36] It is enough to say while a large section of the\r\nUitlanders (as the new alien immigrants are called) in Johannesburg were\r\npreparing to press their claims for reforms upon the government, and to\r\nprovide themselves with arms for that purpose, an outbreak was\r\nprecipitated by the entry into Transvaal territory from Pitsani in\r\nBechuanaland of a force of about five hundred men, mostly in the service\r\nof the British South Africa Company as police, and led by the Company's\r\nAdministrator, with whom (and with Mr. Rhodes, the managing director of\r\nthe Company) a prior arrangement had been made by the reform leaders,\r\nthat in case of trouble at Johannesburg he should, if summoned, come to\r\nthe aid of the Uitlander movement. A question as to the flag under which\r\nthe movement was to be made caused a postponement of the day previously\r\nfixed for making it. The leaders of the force at Pitsani, however,\r\nbecame impatient, thinking that the Boer government was beginning to\r\nsuspect their intentions; and thus, though requested to remain quiet,\r\nthe force started on the evening of December 29. Had they been able, as\r\nthey expected, to get through without fighting, they might probably have\r\nreached Johannesburg in three or four days' march, for the distance is\r\nonly 170 miles. But while the High Commissioner issued a proclamation\r\ndisavowing their action and ordering them to retire, they found\r\nthemselves opposed by the now rapidly gathering Boer levies, were\r\nrepulsed at Krugersdorp, and ultimately forced to surrender on the\r\nforenoon of January 1, 1896, at a place called Doornkop. The\r\nJohannesburg Uitlanders, who, though unprepared for any such sudden\r\nmovement, had risen in sympathy at the news of the inroad, laid down\r\ntheir arms a few days later.[37]\r\n\r\nI have given the bare outline of these latest events in South African\r\nhistory for the sake of bringing the narrative down to the date when I\r\nbegan to write. But as I was at Pretoria and Johannesburg immediately\r\nbefore the rising of December 1895 took place, and had good\r\nopportunities of seeing what forces were at work, and in what direction\r\nthe currents of opinion were setting, I propose to give in a subsequent\r\nchapter (Chapter XXV) a somewhat fuller description of the state of\r\nthings in the Transvaal at the end of 1895, and to reserve for a still\r\nlater chapter some general reflections on the course of South African\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: It has been stated (see Mr. Molteno's _Federal South\r\nAfrica_, p. 87) that Portugal was then prepared to sell her rights for a\r\nsmall sum--according to report, for £12,000.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: In 1891 the southern boundary of Portuguese territory was\r\nfixed by a treaty with Great Britain at a point on the coast named Kosi\r\nBay, about seventy miles south of Lourenço Marques.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See especially the case of Brown _vs._ Leyds, decided in\r\nJanuary, 1897 by the High Court of the South African Republic.

Hammond),\r\nin her little book entitled _A Woman's Part in a Revolution_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n_A JOURNEY THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTRAVELLING AND COMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing one more desires to know about a country, and\r\nespecially a new country, than how one can travel through it. There was\r\nnothing about which, when contemplating a journey to South Africa, I\r\nfound it more difficult to get proper information in England; so I hope\r\nthat a few facts and hints will be useful to those who mean to make the\r\ntour, while to others they may serve to give a notion of the conditions\r\nwhich help or obstruct internal communication.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to coast travel. There is no line of railway running along the\r\ncoast, partly because the towns are small, as well as few and far\r\nbetween, partly because the physical difficulties of constructing a\r\nrailway across the ridges which run down to the sea are considerable,\r\nbut chiefly, no doubt, because the coasting steamers are able to do what\r\nis needed. The large vessels of the Castle Line and the Union Line run\r\nonce a week between Cape Town and Durban (the port of Natal), calling at\r\nPort Elizabeth and East London, sometimes also at Mossel Bay. Thus one\r\ncan find two opportunities every week of getting east or west in\r\npowerful ocean steamers, besides such chances as smaller vessels,\r\ndesigned for freight rather than for passengers, supply. From Durban\r\nthere is one weekly boat as far as Delagoa Bay, a voyage of about\r\ntwenty-four hours. From Delagoa Bay northward to Beira and Mozambique\r\nthe traveller must rely either on the steamers of the German East Africa\r\nLine, which run from Hamburg through the Red Sea all the way to Durban\r\nmaking the entire voyage in about seven weeks, or on Messrs. Rennie's\r\nline, which ply from Durban to Delagoa Bay, Beira and Chinde. The\r\ndrawback to these coast voyages is that the sea is apt to be rough\r\nbetween Cape Town and Durban, less frequently so between Durban and\r\nBeira, and that there is no sheltered Port between Cape Town and Delagoa\r\nBay. At Port Elizabeth and at East London the large steamers lie out in\r\nthe ocean, and passengers reach the land by a small tender, into which\r\nthey are let down in a sort of basket, if there is a sea running, and\r\nare occasionally, if the sea be very high, obliged to wait for a day or\r\nmore until the tender can take them off. Similar conditions have\r\nprevailed at Durban, where a bar has hitherto prevented the big liners,\r\nexcept under very favourable conditions of tide and weather, from\r\nentering the otherwise excellent port. Much, however, has recently been\r\ndone to remove the Durban bar, and it is expected that the largest\r\nsteamers will soon be able to cross it at high tide. At Delagoa Bay the\r\nharbour is spacious and sheltered, though the approach requires care and\r\nis not well buoyed and lighted. At Beira the haven is still better, and\r\ncan be entered at all states of the tide. There is now a brisk goods\r\ntrade, both along the coast between the ports I have mentioned, and from\r\nEurope to each of them.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as to the railways. The railway system is a simple one. A\r\ngreat trunk-line runs north-eastward from Cape Town to a place called De\r\nAar Junction, in the eastern part of the Colony. Here it bifurcates. One\r\nbranch runs first east and then north-north-east through the Orange Free\r\nState and the Transvaal to Pretoria; the other runs north by east to\r\nKimberley and Mafeking, and thence through Bechuanaland to\r\nBulawayo.[38] The distance from Cape Town to Pretoria is ten hundred and\r\nforty miles, and the journey takes (by the fastest train) fifty-two\r\nhours. From Cape Town to Mafeking it is eight hundred and seventy-five\r\nmiles, the journey taking about fifty hours; and from Mafeking to\r\nBulawayo it is a little over five hundred more. From this trunk-line two\r\nimportant branches run southward to the coast, one to Port Elizabeth,\r\nthe other to East London; and by these branches the goods landed at\r\nthose ports, and destined for Kimberley or Johannesburg, are sent up.\r\nThe passenger traffic on the branches is small, as people who want to go\r\nfrom the Eastern towns to Cape Town usually take the less fatiguing as\r\nwell as cheaper sea voyage.\r\n\r\nThree other lines of railway remain. One, opened in the end of 1895,\r\nconnects Durban with Pretoria and Johannesburg; another, opened in 1894,\r\nruns from Delagoa Bay to Pretoria; a third, opened part of it in 1894\r\nand the last part in 1899, connects Beira with Fort Salisbury, in the\r\nterritory of the British South Africa Company.[39]\r\n\r\nOf these railways the trunk-line with its branches was constructed by\r\nand is (except the parts which traverse the Orange Free State and the\r\nTransvaal) owned by the government of Cape Colony. It has latterly paid\r\nvery well. The line from Durban to the Transvaal border at Charlestown\r\nbelongs to the Natal government, and is also a considerable source of\r\nrevenue. The rest of this line, from Charlestown northward through the\r\nTransvaal, is the property of a Dutch company, which also owns the line\r\nfrom Delagoa Bay to Pretoria and from Pretoria to the frontier of the\r\nFree State. The Beira railway belongs to a company controlled by the\r\nBritish South Africa Company, and is virtually a part of that great\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nAll these railways, except the Beira line, have the same gauge, one of\r\nthree feet six inches. The Beira line has a two-foot gauge, but is now\r\n(1899) being enlarged to the standard gauge. Throughout South Africa the\r\nlines of railway are laid on steeper gradients than is usual in Europe:\r\none in forty is not uncommon, and on the Natal line it is sometimes one\r\nin thirty, though this is being gradually reduced. Although the\r\naccommodation at the minor stations is extremely simple, and sometimes\r\neven primitive, the railways are well managed, and the cars are arranged\r\nwith a view to sleep on the night journeys; so that one can manage even\r\nthe long transit from Cape Town to Pretoria with no great fatigue.\r\nConsidering how very thinly peopled the country is, so that there is\r\npractically no local passenger and very little local goods traffic, the\r\nrailway service is much better than could have been expected, and does\r\ngreat credit to the enterprise of the people.\r\n\r\nRailways have made an enormous difference, not to travel only, but to\r\ntrade and to politics; for before the construction of the great\r\ntrunk-line (which was not opened to Pretoria till 1892) the only means\r\nof conveyance was the ox-waggon. The ox-waggon needs a few words of\r\ndescription, for it is the most characteristic feature of South African\r\ntravel. It is a long low structure, drawn by seven, eight, nine, or even\r\nten yoke of oxen, and is surmounted (when intended to carry travellers)\r\nby a convex wooden frame and canvas roof. The animals are harnessed by a\r\nstrong and heavy chain attached to the yoke which holds each pair\r\ntogether. The oxen usually accomplish about twelve miles a day, but can\r\nbe made to do sixteen, or with pressure a little more. They walk very\r\nslowly, and they are allowed to rest and feed more hours than those\r\nduring which they travel. The rest-time is usually the forenoon and\r\ntill about four P.M. with another rest for part of the night. It was in\r\nthese waggons that the Boers carried with them their wives and children\r\nand household goods in the great exodus of 1836. It was in such waggons\r\nthat nearly all the explorations of South Africa have been made, such as\r\nthose by the missionaries, and particularly by Robert Moffat and by\r\nLivingstone (in his earlier journeys), and such as those of the hunting\r\npioneers, men like Anderson, Gordon-Cumming, and Selous. And to this day\r\nit is on the waggon that whoever traverses any unfrequented region must\r\nrely. Horses, and even mules, soon break down; and as the traveller must\r\ncarry his food and other necessaries of camp life with him, he always\r\nneeds the waggon as a basis of operations, even if he has a seasoned\r\nhorse which he can use for two or three days when speed is required.\r\nWaggons have, moreover, another value for a large party; they can be\r\nreadily formed into a laager, or camp, by being drawn into a circle,\r\nwith the oxen placed inside and so kept safe from the attacks of wild\r\nbeasts. And where there are hostile Kafirs to be feared, such a laager\r\nis an efficient fortress, from within which a few determined marksmen\r\nhave often successfully resisted the onslaught of hordes of natives. An\r\nimmense trade has been carried on by means of ox-waggons between the\r\npoints where the railways end and the new settlements in Matabililand\r\nand Mashonaland. When I passed from Mafeking to Bulawayo in October,\r\n1895, thousands of oxen were drawing hundreds of waggons along the track\r\nbetween those towns. When, a month later, I travelled from Fort\r\nSalisbury to Chimoyo, then the terminus of the Beira line, I passed\r\ncountless waggons standing idle along the track, because owing to the\r\nlocusts and the drought which had destroyed most of the grass, the oxen\r\nhad either died or grown too lean and feeble to be able to drag the\r\nloads. Hence the cattle-plague which in 1896 carried off the larger part\r\nof the transport-oxen was a terrible misfortune, not only to the\r\nnatives who owned these animals, but also to the whole northern region,\r\nwhich largely depends upon cattle transport for its food, its comforts,\r\nits building materials, and its mine machinery.\r\n\r\nIt is the character of the country that has permitted the waggon to\r\nbecome so important a factor in South African exploration, politics, and\r\ncommerce. The interior, though high, is not generally rugged. Much of\r\nit--indeed, all the eastern and northern parts--is a vast rolling plain,\r\nacross which wheeled vehicles can pass with no greater difficulty than\r\nthe beds of the streams, sometimes deeply cut through soft ground,\r\npresent. The ranges of hills which occur here and there are generally\r\ntraversed by passes, which, though stony, are not steep enough to be\r\nimpracticable. Over most of the southern half of the plateau there is no\r\nwood, and where forests occur the trees seldom grow thick together, and\r\nthe brushwood is so dry and small that it can soon be cut away to make a\r\npassage. Had South Africa been thickly wooded, like the eastern parts of\r\nNorth America or some parts of Australia, waggon-travelling would have\r\nbeen difficult or impossible; but most of it is, like the country\r\nbetween the Missouri River and the Great Salt Lake, a dry open country,\r\nwhere the waggon can be made a true ship of the desert. This explains\r\nthe fact, so surprising to most European readers of African travel and\r\nadventure, that wherever man can walk or ride he can take his moving\r\nhome with him.\r\n\r\nFor rapid transit, however, the traveller who has passed beyond the\r\nrailway is now not wholly dependent on the ox. Coaches, drawn sometimes\r\nby mules, sometimes by horses, run from some points on the railways to\r\noutlying settlements; they are, however, always uncomfortable and not\r\nalways safe. They travel night and day, usually accomplishing from six\r\nto eight miles an hour on good ground, but much less where the surface\r\nis sandy or rugged. In the north and north-east of Cape Colony and in\r\nthe Transvaal, as well as in Matabililand, horses are very little used\r\neither for riding or for driving, owing to the prevalence of a disease\r\ncalled horse-sickness, which attacks nearly every animal, and from which\r\nonly about a quarter recover. This is one reason why so little\r\nexploration has been done on horseback; and it is a point to be noted by\r\nthose who desire to travel in the country, and who naturally think of\r\nthe mode by which people used to make journeys in Europe, and by which\r\nthey make journeys still in large parts of South and of North America,\r\nas well as in Western Asia.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the \"tracks\" used by waggons and coaches; the reader\r\nmust not suppose that these tracks are roads. There are few made roads\r\nin South Africa, except in the neighbourhood of Cape Town, Durban,\r\nMaritzburg, Graham's Town, and one or two other towns. Those in Natal\r\nare among the best. Neither are there (except as aforesaid) any bridges,\r\nsave here and there rude ones of logs thrown across a stream bed.\r\nElsewhere the track is merely a line across the veldt (prairie), marked\r\nand sometimes cut deep by the wheels of many waggons, where all that man\r\nhas done has been to remove the trees or bushes. Here and there the\r\nedges of the steep stream banks have been cut down so as to allow a\r\nvehicle to descend more easily to the bottom, where during the rains the\r\nstream flows, and where during the rest of the year the ground is sandy\r\nor muddy. After heavy rain a stream is sometimes impassable for days\r\ntogether, and the waggons have to wait on the bank till the torrent\r\nsubsides. At all times these water channels are troublesome, for the\r\noxen or mules are apt to jib or get out of hand in descending the steep\r\nslope, and it is no easy matter to get them urged up the steep slope on\r\nthe other side. Accidents often occur, and altogether it may be said\r\nthat the _dongas_--this is the name given to these hollow stream\r\nchannels--form the most exciting feature of South African travel (in\r\nplaces where wild beasts and natives are no longer dangerous) and afford\r\nthe greatest scope for the skill of the South African driver.\r\n\r\nSkilful he must be, for he never drives less than six span of oxen, and\r\nseldom less than three pairs of horses or mules (the Bulawayo coach had,\r\nin 1895, five pairs). It takes two men to drive. One wields an immensely\r\nlong whip, while the other holds the reins. Both incessantly\r\napostrophise the animals. It is chiefly with the whip that the team is\r\ndriven; but if the team is one of mules, one of the two drivers is for a\r\nlarge part of the time on his feet, running alongside the beasts,\r\nbeating them with a short whip and shouting to them by their names, with\r\nsuch adjectives, expletives, and other objurgations as he can command.\r\nMany Dutchmen do drive wonderfully well.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of internal water travel by river or lake, because\r\nnone exists. There are no lakes, and there is not a river with water\r\nenough to float the smallest steamboat, except some reaches of the\r\nLimpopo River in the wet season. The only steamer that plies anywhere on\r\na river is that which ascends the Pungwe River from Beira to\r\nFontesvilla; it goes only as far as the tide goes, and on most of its\r\ntrips spends fully half its time sticking on the sand-banks with which\r\nthe Pungwe abounds. So far as I know, no one has ever proposed to make a\r\ncanal in any part of the country.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be gathered that there is no country\r\nwhere railways are and will be more needed than South Africa. They are\r\nthe chief need of the newly settled districts, and the best means, next\r\nto a wise and conciliatory administration, of preventing fresh native\r\noutbreaks. Unfortunately, they will for a great while have no local\r\ntraffic, because most of the country they pass through has not one white\r\ninhabitant to the square mile. Their function is to connect the coast\r\nwith the distant mining centres, in which population has begun to grow.\r\nTo lay them is, however, comparatively cheap work. Except in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of a town, nothing has to be paid for the land.\r\nThe gradients all through the interior plateau are comparatively easy,\r\nand the engineers have in Africa cared less for making their ascents\r\ngentle than we do in older countries. Even in the hilly parts of the\r\nTransvaal and Matabililand the ranges are not high or steep, and one can\r\nturn a kopje instead of cutting or tunnelling through it. Few bridges\r\nare needed, because there are few rivers.\r\n\r\nA word as to another point on which any one planning a tour to South\r\nAfrica may be curious--the accommodation obtainable. Most travellers\r\nhave given the inns a bad name. My own experience is scanty, for we were\r\nso often the recipient of private hospitality as to have occasion to\r\nsleep in an inn (apart from the \"stores\" of Bechuanaland and\r\nMashonaland, of which more hereafter) in four places only, Mafeking,\r\nLadybrand, Durban, and Bloemfontein. But it seemed to us that,\r\nconsidering the newness of the country and the difficulty in many places\r\nof furnishing a house well and of securing provisions, the entertainment\r\nwas quite tolerable, sometimes much better than one had expected. In the\r\ntwo Colonies, and the chief places of the two Republics, clean beds and\r\nenough to eat can always be had; in the largest places there is nothing\r\nto complain of, though the prices are sometimes high. Luxuries are\r\nunprocurable, but no sensible man will go to a new country expecting\r\nluxuries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: At the time of my visit it went no further than Mafeking.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: There is also a line of railway from Port Elizabeth to\r\nGraaf-Reinet, some short branch lines near Cape Town, and a small line\r\nfrom Graham's Town to the coast at Port Alfred.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFROM CAPE TOWN TO BULAWAYO\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this and the four following chapters I propose to give some account\r\nof the country through which the traveller passes on his way from the\r\ncoast to the points which are the natural goals of a South African\r\njourney, Kimberley and Johannesburg, Bulawayo and Fort Salisbury, hoping\r\nthereby to convey a more lively impression of the aspects of the land\r\nand its inhabitants than general descriptions can give, and incidentally\r\nto find opportunities for touching upon some of the questions on which\r\nthe future of the country will turn.\r\n\r\nFirst, a few words about the voyage. You can go to South Africa either\r\nby one of the great British lines across the Atlantic to the ports of\r\nCape Colony and Natal, or by the German line through the Red Sea and\r\nalong the East African coast to Beira or Delagoa Bay. The steamers of\r\nthe German line take thirty days from Port Said to Beira, and two days\r\nmore to Delagoa Bay. They are good boats, though much smaller than those\r\nof the two chief English lines to the Cape (the Castle and the Union),\r\nand the voyage from Port Said has the advantage of being, at most times\r\nof the year, a smooth one pretty nearly the whole way. They touch at\r\nAden, Zanzibar, Dar-es-Salaam, and Quilimane, and give an opportunity of\r\nseeing those places. But all along the East African coast the heat is\r\nexcessive--a damp, depressing heat. And the whole time required to reach\r\nBeira from England, even if one travels by rail from Calais to\r\nMarseilles, Brindisi, or Naples, and takes a British steamer thence to\r\nPort Said, joining the German boat at the latter port, is more than five\r\nweeks. Nearly everybody, therefore, chooses the Atlantic route from\r\nSouthampton or London to the Cape. The Atlantic voyage, which lasts from\r\nsixteen to twenty days, is, on the whole, a pleasant and healthful one.\r\nThe steamers, both those of the Castle Line and those of the Union\r\nLine--and the same may be said for the New Zealand Line and the Aberdeen\r\nLine which plies to Australia, both of these touching at the Cape--are\r\ncomfortable and well appointed, and I cannot imagine any navigation more\r\nscrupulously careful than that which I saw on board the _Hawarden\r\nCastle_, by which I went out and returned. During the winter and spring\r\nmonths there is often pretty rough weather from England as far as\r\nMadeira. But from that island onward, or at any rate from the Canaries\r\nonward, one has usually a fairly smooth sea with moderate breezes till\r\nwithin two or three days of Cape Town, when head winds are frequently\r\nencountered. Nor is the heat excessive. Except during the two days\r\nbetween Cape Verde and the equator, it is never more than what one can\r\nenjoy during the day and tolerate during the night. One sees land only\r\nat Madeira, where the steamer coals for a few hours; at the picturesque\r\nCanary Islands, between which she passes, gaining, if the weather be\r\nclear, a superb view of the magnificent Peak of Teneriffe; and at Cape\r\nVerde, where she runs (in the daytime) within a few miles of the African\r\ncoast. Those who enjoy the colours of the sea and of the sea skies, and\r\nto whom the absence of letters, telegrams, and newspapers is welcome,\r\nwill find few more agreeable ways of passing a fortnight. After Cape\r\nFinisterre very few vessels are seen. After Madeira every night reveals\r\nnew stars rising from the ocean as our own begin to vanish.\r\n\r\n    Tutte le stolle già dell' altro polo\r\n    Vedea la notte, e il nostro tanto basso\r\n    Che non sorgeva fuor del marin suolo,[40]\r\n\r\nas Ulysses says, in Dante's poem, of his voyage to the southern\r\nhemisphere. The pleasure of watching unfamiliar constellations rise from\r\nthe east and sweep across the sky, is a keen one, which often kept us\r\nlate from sleep.\r\n\r\nFor a few hours only before reaching Cape Town does one discern on the\r\neastern horizon the stern grey mountains that rise along the barren\r\ncoast. A nobler site for a city and a naval stronghold than that of the\r\ncapital of South Africa can hardly be imagined. It rivals Gibraltar and\r\nConstantinople, Bombay and San Francisco. Immediately behind the town,\r\nwhich lies along the sea, the majestic mass of Table Mountain rises to a\r\nheight of 3600 feet, a steep and partly wooded slope capped by a long\r\nline of sheer sandstone precipices more than 1000 feet high, and flanked\r\nto right and left by bold, isolated peaks. The beautiful sweep of the\r\nbay in front, the towering crags behind, and the romantic pinnacles\r\nwhich rise on either side, make a landscape that no one who has seen it\r\ncan forget. The town itself is disappointing. It has preserved very\r\nlittle of its old Dutch character. The miniature canals which once\r\ntraversed it are gone. The streets, except two, are rather narrow, and\r\nbordered by low houses; nor is there much to admire in the buildings,\r\nexcept the handsome Parliament House, the new post office, and the\r\noffices of the Standard Bank. The immediate suburbs, inhabited chiefly\r\nby Malays and other coloured people, are mean. But the neighbourhood is\r\nextremely attractive. To the north-west Table Mountain and its spurs\r\ndescend steeply to the sea, and the road which runs along the beach past\r\nthe village of Sea Point offers a long series of striking views of shore\r\nand crag. It is on the east, however, that the most beautiful spots lie.\r\nFive miles from Cape Town and connected with it by railway, the village\r\nof Rondebosch nestles under the angle of Table Mountain, and a mile\r\nfarther along the line is the little town of Wynberg. Round these\r\nplaces, or between them and Cape Town, nearly all the richer, and a\r\ngreat many even of the poorer, white people of Cape Town live. The roads\r\nare bordered by pretty villas, whose grounds, concealed by no walls, are\r\nfilled with magnolias and other flowering trees and shrubs. Avenues of\r\ntall pines or of superb oaks, planted by the Dutch in the last century,\r\nrun here and there along the by-roads. Immediately above, the grey\r\nprecipices of Table Mountain tower into the air, while in the opposite\r\ndirection a break in the woods shows in the far distance the sharp\r\nsummits, snow-tipped during the winter months, of the lofty range of the\r\nHottentots Holland Mountains. It would be hard to find anywhere, even in\r\nItaly or the Pyrenees, more exquisite combinations of soft and\r\ncultivated landscape with grand mountain forms than this part of the\r\nCape peninsula presents. Perhaps the most charming nook of all is where\r\nthe quaint old Dutch farmhouse of Groot Constantia[41] stands among its\r\nvineyards, about ten miles from Cape Town. Behind it is the range which\r\nconnects the hills of Simon's Bay with Table Mountain; its declivities\r\nare at this point covered with the graceful silver-tree, whose\r\nglistening foliage shines brighter than that of the European olive.\r\nBeneath the farmhouse are the vineyards which produce the famous sweet\r\nwine that bears the name of Constantia, sloping gently towards the\r\nwaters of False Bay, whose farther side is guarded by a wall of\r\nfrowning peaks, while the deep blue misty ocean opens in the distance.\r\nIt is a landscape unlike anything one can see in Europe, and though the\r\nlight in sea and sky is brilliant, the brilliance is on this coast soft\r\nand mellow, unlike the clear sharp radiance of the arid interior.\r\n\r\nNo one who cares for natural scenery quits Cape Town without ascending\r\nTable Mountain, whose summit affords not only a very beautiful and\r\nextensive prospect over the surrounding country, but a striking ocean\r\nview. Looking down the narrow gullies that descend from the top, one\r\nsees the intensely blue sea closing them below, framed between their\r\njutting crags, while on the other side the busy streets and wharves of\r\nCape Town lie directly under the eye, and one can discover the vehicles\r\nin the streets and the trees in the Governor's garden. The heaths and\r\nother flowers and shrubs that grow profusely over the wide top, which is\r\nnot flat, as he who looks at it from the sea fancies, but cut up by\r\nglens, with here and there lake reservoirs in the hollows, are very\r\nlovely, and give a novel and peculiar charm to this ascent.[42] Nor is\r\nthe excursion to Cape Point, the real Cape of Storms of Bartholomew\r\nDiaz, and the Cape of Good Hope of Vasco da Gama, less beautiful. An\r\nhour in the railway brings one to Simon's Bay, the station of the\r\nBritish naval squadron, a small but fairly well sheltered inlet under\r\nhigh hills. From this one drives for four hours over a very rough track\r\nthrough a lonely and silent country, sometimes sandy, sometimes thick\r\nwith brushwood, but everywhere decked with brilliant flowers, to the\r\nCape, a magnificent headland rising almost vertically from the ocean to\r\na height of 800 feet. Long, heavy surges are always foaming on the\r\nrocks below and nowhere, even on this troubled coast, where the hot\r\nMozambique current meets a stream of cold Antarctic water, do gales more\r\noften howl and shriek than round these rocky pinnacles. One can well\r\nunderstand the terror with which the Portuguese sailors five centuries\r\nago used to see the grim headland loom up through the clouds driven by\r\nthe strong south-easters, that kept them struggling for days or weeks to\r\nround the cape that marked their way to India. But Sir Francis Drake,\r\nwho passed it coming home westward from his ever-famous voyage round the\r\nworld, had a more auspicious experience: \"We ran hard aboard the Cape,\r\nfinding the report of the Portuguese to be most false, who affirm that\r\nit is the most dangerous cape of the world, never without intolerable\r\nstorms and present danger to travellers who come near the same. This\r\ncape is a most stately thing, and the finest cape we saw in the whole\r\ncircumference of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nA third excursion, which well repays the traveller, is to the quaint\r\nlittle town of Stellenbosch, founded by Adrian van der Stel (Governor of\r\nthe Colony) in 1680, and called after himself and his wife, whose name\r\nwas Bosch. It is built in genuine Dutch style, with straight streets of\r\ntwo-storied white houses, the windows nearly flush with the walls as in\r\nHolland, the wood-work and the green shutters those of Holland, and long\r\nlines of dark-green oaks shading the foot-walks on each side the street.\r\nSoft, rich pastures all round--for there is plenty of water brought down\r\nfrom the hills--complete the resemblance to a Hobbema landscape; and it\r\nis only when one looks up and sees rocky mountains soaring behind into\r\nthe sky that the illusion is broken. It is here, and in the town of\r\nSwellendam, farther east, and in some of the villages that lie northward\r\nof Stellenbosch in the western province, that the Dutch element has\r\nremained strongest and has best retained its ancient ways and customs.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, delayed long enough round the capital, and it is time\r\nto plunge into the interior by the railway. Sixty miles to the north of\r\nCape Town, the trunk-line, which has threaded its way through the\r\nvalleys of an outlying range of mountains, reaches the foot of the great\r\ninner table-land at a place called Hex River, and in an hour climbs by\r\nzigzags up an incline which is in some places as steep as one in\r\nthirty-five, mounting 1600 feet into a desert land. Rugged brown\r\nmountains, sometimes craggy, sometimes covered with masses of loose\r\nstone, rise above the lower ground, now a valley, now an open plain,\r\nthrough which the railway takes its eastward way. The bushes, which had\r\nbeen tall and covered with blossoms on the ascent, are now stunted,\r\nbearing small and usually withered flowers. Hardly an herb, and not a\r\nblade of grass, is to be seen on the ground, which is sometimes of clay,\r\nbaked hard by the sun, sometimes of sand, without a drop of water\r\nanywhere. Yet water flows when, now and then in the summer, a storm\r\nbreaks, or a few showers come; and then nature revives, and for a week\r\nor two flowers spring from the soil and a fresher green comes upon the\r\nbushes. In a landscape so arid one hears with surprise that the land is\r\nworth ten shillings an acre for one or two of the smallest shrubs give\r\nfeed for sheep, and there are wells scattered about sufficient for the\r\nflocks. The farms are large, usually of at least six thousand acres, so\r\none seldom sees a farmhouse. The farmers are all of Boer stock. They\r\nlead a lonely life in a silent and melancholy nature, but their habitual\r\ngravity has not made them unsocial, for they are fond of riding or\r\ndriving in their waggons to visit one another on all occasions of\r\nfestivity or mourning. Every ten or fifteen miles there is a station,\r\nand here the British element in the population appears, chiefly occupied\r\nin store-keeping. At Matjesfontein one finds an hotel and a number of\r\nsmall villas built to serve as a health resort. Wells surrounded by\r\nAustralian gums planted for shade, make a little oasis in the desert.\r\nFarther east the village of Beaufort West, the only place along the line\r\nthat aspires to be called a town, boasts a church with a spire, and has\r\none or two streets, though most of its houses are stuck down irregularly\r\nover a surface covered with broken bottles and empty sardine and\r\npreserved meat tins. Here, too, there is a large, shallow pond of water,\r\nand here people with weak lungs come to breathe the keen, dry,\r\ninvigorating air. Of its efficacy there is no doubt, but one would think\r\nthat the want of society and of variety would be almost as depressing as\r\nthe air is stimulating. The prospects have a certain beauty, for beyond\r\nthe wide, bare, greyish-brown plain to the south sharp mountains stand\r\nup, which take at sunrise and sunset delightful tints of blue and\r\npurple, and the sense of a vast expanse on earth beneath and in heaven\r\nabove has something strange and solemn. But the monotony of perpetual\r\nsunlight upon a landscape which has no foregrounds and never changes,\r\nsave in colour, must be trying to those who have no occupation except\r\nthat of getting well.\r\n\r\nThis Karroo scenery continues, with little variation, for hundreds of\r\nmiles. To the north of the railway, which runs mostly from west to east,\r\nthe aspect of the country is much the same, dry, stony, and forbidding,\r\nfor full three hundred miles to the Orange River, and beyond that into\r\nNamaqualand. Except for the few houses at some of the stations, it seems\r\na wilderness; yet here and there stand tiny villages, connected by lines\r\nof coach with the railway, whither the neighbouring farmers come to\r\nsupply their household needs. But as the train moves farther and farther\r\neastward the features of nature grow less austere. The mountains by\r\ndegrees recede or sink; the country becomes more of an open plain,\r\nthough with isolated hills visible here and there over its expanse. It\r\nis also slightly greener, and after the rains some little grass springs\r\nup, besides the low, succulent shrub which the sheep eat. At De Aar\r\nJunction, five hundred miles from Cape Town, the line to Bloemfontein\r\nand the Transvaal branches off to the right. We follow the western\r\nbranch over a vast slightly undulating plain to the Orange River, here a\r\nperennial stream, and at six hundred and forty-six miles from Cape Town\r\nfind ourselves once more in the haunts of men at Kimberley.\r\n\r\nKimberley, the city of diamonds, has had a curious history. In 1869-70\r\nthe precious crystals, first found in 1867 near the Orange River, were\r\ndiscovered here in considerable quantity. A sudden rush of adventurers\r\nfrom all parts of South Africa, as well as from Europe, gave it in three\r\nor four years a population of many thousands. The mining claims were\r\nthen and for some years afterwards in the hands of a large number of\r\npersons and companies who had opened them or purchased them. The\r\ncompetition of these independent miner-workers was bringing down the\r\nprice of the stones, and the waste or leakage arising from the theft of\r\nstones by the native work-people, who sold them to European I.D.B.\r\n(illicit diamond-buyers), seriously reduced the profits of mining. It\r\nwas soon seen that the consolidation of the various concerns would\r\neffect enormous savings and form the only means of keeping up the price\r\nof diamonds. The process of amalgamating the claims and interests and\r\nmerging them in one huge corporation was completed in 1885, chiefly by\r\nthe skill and boldness of Mr. Cecil J. Rhodes, who had gone to Natal for\r\nhis health shortly before 1870, and came up to Kimberley in the first\r\nmonths of the rush. Since the amalgamation, the great corporation called\r\nthe De Beers Consolidated Mining Company (which now owns nearly all the\r\nmines), has reduced the output of diamonds to just such an annual amount\r\nas experience has proved that Europe and America--the United States is\r\nthe chief market--are able to take at a price high enough to leave a\r\nlarge profit. By this means the price has been well maintained. This\r\npolicy, however, has incidentally reduced the population of Kimberley.\r\nOne powerful corporation, with its comparatively small staff of\r\nemployees, has taken the place of the crowd of independent adventurers\r\nof the old days, and some of the mines have been closed because the rest\r\nare sufficient to produce as many diamonds as it is deemed prudent to\r\nput upon the market. Thus there are now only about 10,000 people in the\r\ntown, and some of the poorer quarters are almost deserted, the stores\r\nand taverns, as well as the shanty dwellings, empty and falling to\r\npieces. In the better quarters, however, the old roughness has been\r\nreplaced by order and comfort. Many of the best villas are embowered in\r\ngroves of tall Australian gum-trees, while the streets and roads are\r\nbordered either by gum-trees or by hedges of prickly-pear or agave. The\r\nstreets are wide, and most of the houses are detached and of one story,\r\nbuilt like Indian bungalows; so the town covers an area quite\r\ndisproportionate to its population, and gives the impression of an\r\nextensive city. For the residence of the Europeans employed in the two\r\ngreat mines which the Company works, a suburb called Kenilworth has been\r\nbuilt by Mr. Rhodes, where neat houses of four, five, or six rooms each\r\nstand in handsome avenues planted with Australian trees, the so-called\r\n\"beefwood\" and the red gum. They are not beautiful trees, but they have\r\nthe merit of growing very fast, and any shade is welcome.\r\n\r\nThe diamonds are found in beds of clay, of which there are two: a yellow\r\nand softish clay, lying on or near the surface, and a hard blue clay,\r\nlying deeper. These clays, which are usually covered by a thin layer of\r\ncalcareous rock, are supposed to be the remains of mud-pits due to\r\nvolcanic action, such as the so-called mud-volcanoes of Iceland, near\r\nNámaskard, on the banks of Lake Myvatn, or such as the similar boiling\r\nmud-pits of the Yellowstone Park country, called from their brilliant\r\ncolours the \"Paint-pots.\" It is, at any rate, from circular clay basins,\r\ninclosed within a harder rock (basalt, black shale, and quartzite) that\r\nthe stones are obtained. Some of the mines are worked even to a depth of\r\n1200 feet by shafts and subterranean galleries. Some are open, and\r\nthese, particularly that called the Wesselton Mine, are an interesting\r\nsight. This deep hollow, one-third of a mile in circumference and 100\r\nfeet deep, inclosed by a strong fence of barbed wire, is filled by a\r\nswarm of active Kafir workmen, cleaving the \"hard blue\" with pickaxes,\r\npiling it up on barrows, and carrying it off to the wide fields; where\r\nit is left exposed to the sun, and, during three months, to the rain.\r\nHaving been thus subjected to a natural decomposition, it is the more\r\nreadily brought by the pickaxe into smaller fragments before being sent\r\nto the mills, where it is crushed, pulverized, and finally washed to get\r\nat the stones. Nowhere in the world does the hidden wealth of the soil\r\nand the element of chance in its discovery strike one so forcibly as\r\nhere, where you are shown a piece of ground a few acres in extent, and\r\nare told, \"Out of this pit diamonds of the value of £12,000,000 have\r\nbeen taken.\" Twenty-six years ago the ground might have been bought for\r\n£50.\r\n\r\nThe most striking sight at Kimberley, and one unique in the world, is\r\nfurnished by the two so-called \"compounds\" in which the natives who work\r\nin the mines are housed and confined. They are huge inclosures,\r\nunroofed, but covered with a wire netting to prevent anything from being\r\nthrown out of them over the walls, and with a subterranean entrance to\r\nthe adjoining mine. The mine is worked on the system of three eight-hour\r\nshifts, so that the workman is never more than eight hours together\r\nunderground. Round the interior of the wall there are built sheds or\r\nhuts, in which the natives live and sleep when not working. A hospital\r\nis also provided within the inclosure, as well as a school where the\r\nwork-people can spend their leisure in learning to read and write. No\r\nspirits are sold--an example of removing temptation from the native\r\nwhich it is to be wished that the legislature of Cape Colony would\r\nfollow. Every entrance is strictly guarded, and no visitors, white or\r\nnative, are permitted, all supplies being obtained from the store\r\nwithin, kept by the Company. The De Beers mine compound contained at the\r\ntime of my visit 2600 natives, belonging to a great variety of tribes,\r\nso that here one could see specimens of the different native types, from\r\nNatal and Pondoland on the south, to the shores of Lake Tanganyika in\r\nthe far north. They come from every quarter, attracted by the high\r\nwages, usually eighteen to thirty shillings a week, and remain for three\r\nmonths or more and occasionally even for long periods, knowing, of\r\ncourse, that they have to submit to the precautions which are absolutely\r\nneeded to prevent them from appropriating the diamonds they may happen\r\nto find in the course of their work. To encourage honesty, ten per cent,\r\nof the value of any stone which a workman may find is given to him if he\r\nbrings it himself to the overseer, and the value of the stones on which\r\nthis ten per cent, is paid is estimated at £400,000 in each year.\r\nNevertheless, a certain number of thefts occur. I heard from a\r\nmissionary an anecdote of a Basuto who, after his return from Kimberley,\r\nwas describing how, on one occasion, his eye fell on a valuable diamond\r\nin the clay he was breaking into fragments. While he was endeavouring to\r\npick it up he perceived the overseer approaching, and, having it by this\r\ntime in his hand, was for a moment terribly frightened, the punishment\r\nfor theft being very severe. The overseer, however, passed on. \"And\r\nthen,\" said the Basuto, \"I knew that there was indeed a God, for He had\r\npreserved me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the native has earned the sum he wants--and his earnings accumulate\r\nquickly, since he can live upon very little--he takes his wages in\r\nEnglish sovereigns, a coin now current through all Africa as far as\r\nTanganyika, goes home to his own tribe, perhaps a month's or six weeks'\r\njourney distant, buys two oxen, buys with them a wife, and lives\r\nhappily, or at least lazily, ever after. Here in the vast oblong\r\ncompound one sees Zulus from Natal, Fingos, Pondos, Tembus, Basutos,\r\nBechuanas, Gungunhana's subjects from the Portuguese territories, some\r\nfew Matabili and Makalaka, and plenty of Zambesi boys from the tribes on\r\nboth sides of that great river--a living ethnological collection such as\r\ncan be examined nowhere else in South Africa. Even Bushmen, or at least\r\nnatives with some Bushman blood in them, are not wanting. They live\r\npeaceably together, and amuse themselves in their several ways during\r\ntheir leisure hours. Besides games of chance we saw a game resembling\r\n\"fox and geese,\" played with pebbles on a board; and music was being\r\ndiscoursed on two rude native instruments, the so-called \"Kafir piano,\"\r\nmade of pieces of iron of unequal length fastened side by side in a\r\nframe, and a still ruder contrivance of hard bits of wood, also of\r\nunequal size, which when struck by a stick emit different notes, the\r\nfirst beginnings of a tune. A very few were reading or writing letters,\r\nthe rest busy with their cooking or talking to one another. Some tribes\r\nare incessant talkers, and in this strange mixing-pot of black men one\r\nmay hear a dozen languages spoken as one passes from group to group.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Kimberley is healthy, and even bracing, though not\r\npleasant when a north-west wind from the Kalahari Desert fills the air\r\nwith sand and dust. Its dryness recommends it as a resort for\r\nconsumptive patients, while the existence of a cultivated, though small,\r\nsociety, makes it a less doleful place of residence than are the\r\nsanatoria of the Karroo. The country round is, however, far from\r\nattractive. Save on the east, where there rises a line of hills just\r\nhigh enough to catch the lovely lights of evening and give colour and\r\nvariety to the landscape, the prospect is monotonous in every direction.\r\nLike the ocean, this vast plain is so flat that you cannot see how vast\r\nit is. Except in the environs of the town, it is unbroken by tree or\r\nhouse, and in a part of those environs the masses of bluish-grey mine\r\nrefuse that strew the ground give a dismal and even squalid air to the\r\nforeground of the view. One is reminded of the deserted coal-pits that\r\nsurround Wigan, or the burnt-out and waste parts of the Black Country in\r\nSouth Staffordshire, though at Kimberley there is, happily, no\r\ncoal-smoke or sulphurous fumes in the air, no cinder on the surface, no\r\ncoal-dust to thicken the mud and blacken the roads. Some squalor one\r\nmust have with that disturbance of nature which mining involves, but\r\nhere the enlightened activity of the Company and the settlers has done\r\nits best to mitigate these evils by the planting of trees and orchards,\r\nby the taste which many of the private houses show, and by the provision\r\nhere and there of open spaces for games.\r\n\r\nFrom Kimberley the newly-opened railway runs one hundred and fifty miles\r\nfarther north to Vryburg, till lately the capital of the Crown Colony of\r\nBritish Bechuanaland, annexed in 1895 to Cape Colony, and thence to\r\nMafeking. After a few miles the line crosses the Vaal River, here a\r\nrespectable stream for South Africa, since it has, even in the dry\r\nseason, more water than the Cam at Cambridge, or the Cherwell at\r\nOxford--perhaps as much as the Arno at Florence. It flows in a wide,\r\nrocky bed, about thirty feet below the level of the adjoining country.\r\nThe country becomes more undulating as the line approaches the\r\nfrontiers, first of the Orange Free State, and then of the Transvaal\r\nRepublic, which bounds that State on the north. Bushes are seen, and\r\npresently trees, nearly all prickly mimosas, small and unattractive, but\r\na pleasant relief from the bare flats of Kimberley, whence all the wood\r\nthat formerly grew there has been taken for mine props and for fuel.\r\nThere is more grass, too, and presently patches of cultivated land\r\nappear, where Kafirs grow maize, called in South Africa \"mealies.\" Near\r\nthe village of Taungs[43] a large native reservation is passed, where\r\npart of the Batlapin tribe is settled, and here a good deal of ground is\r\ntilled, though in September, when no crop is visible, one scarcely\r\nnotices the fields, since they are entirely unenclosed, mere strips on\r\nthe veldt, a little browner than the rest, and with fewer shrublets on\r\nthem. But the landscape remains equally featureless and monotonous,\r\nredeemed only, as evening falls, by the tints of purple and violet which\r\nglow upon the low ridges or swells of ground that rise in the distance.\r\nVryburg is a cheerful little place of brick walls and corrugated-iron\r\nroofs; Mafeking another such, still smaller and, being newer, with a\r\nstill larger proportion of shanties to houses. At Mafeking the railway\r\nended in 1895. It has since been opened all the way to Bulawayo. Here\r\nends also the territory of Cape Colony, the rest of Bechuanaland to the\r\nnorth and west forming the so-called Bechuanaland Protectorate, which in\r\nOctober, 1895, was handed over by the Colonial Office, subject to\r\ncertain restrictions and provisions for the benefit of the natives, to\r\nthe British South Africa Company, within the sphere of whose operations\r\nit had, by the charter of 1890, been included. After the invasion of the\r\nTransvaal Republic by the expedition led by Dr. Jameson, which started\r\nfrom Pitsani, a few miles north of Mafeking, in December, 1895, this\r\ntransfer was recalled, and Bechuanaland is now again under the direct\r\ncontrol of the High Commissioner for South Africa as representing the\r\nBritish Crown. It is administered by magistrates, who have a force of\r\npolice at their command, and by native chiefs, the most powerful and\r\nfamous of whom is Khama.\r\n\r\nClose to Mafeking itself there was living a chieftain whose long career\r\nis interwoven with many of the wars and raids that went on between the\r\nBoers and the natives from 1840 to 1885--Montsioa (pronounced\r\n\"Montsiwa\"), the head of a tribe of Barolongs. We were taken to see him,\r\nand found him sitting on a low chair under a tree in the midst of his\r\nhuge native village, dressed in a red flannel shirt, a pair of corduroy\r\ntrousers, and a broad grey felt hat with a jackal's tail stuck in it for\r\nornament. His short woolly hair was white, and his chocolate-coloured\r\nskin, hard and tough like that of a rhinoceros, was covered with a\r\nfretwork of tiny wrinkles, such as one seldom sees on a European face.\r\nHe was proud of his great age (eighty-five), and recalled the names of\r\nseveral British governors and generals during the last seventy years.\r\nBut his chief interest was in inquiries (through his interpreter)\r\nregarding the Queen and events in England, and he amused his visitors by\r\nthe diplomatic shrewdness with which, on being told that there had been\r\na change of government in England, and a majority in favour of the new\r\ngovernment, he observed \"They have made a mistake; they could not have\r\nhad a better government than the old one.\" He was a wealthy man, owning\r\nan immense number of the oxen which then carried on (for the cattle\r\nplague soon after destroyed most of them) the transport service between\r\nMafeking and Bulawayo; and, from all I could learn, he ruled his people\r\nwell, following the counsels of the British government, which in 1885\r\ndelivered him out of the hands of the Boers. He died in the middle of\r\n1896.\r\n\r\nAt Mafeking we bade farewell to the railway, and prepared to plunge into\r\nthe wilderness. We travelled in a light American waggon, having a Cape\r\nDutchman as driver and a coloured \"Cape boy\" to help him, but no other\r\nattendants. The waggon had a small iron tank, which we filled with water\r\nthat had been boiled to kill noxious germs, and with this we made our\r\nsoup and tea. For provisions we carried biscuits, a little tinned soup\r\nand meat, and a few bottles of soda-water. These last proved to be the\r\nmost useful part of our stores, for we found the stream-or well-water\r\nalong the route undrinkable, and our mouths were often so parched that\r\nit was only by the help of sips of soda-water that we could manage to\r\nswallow the dry food. At the European stores which occur along the road,\r\nusually at intervals of thirty or forty miles, though sometimes there is\r\nnone for sixty miles or more, we could often procure eggs and sometimes\r\na lean chicken; so there was enough to support life, though seldom did\r\nwe get what is called in America \"a square meal.\"\r\n\r\nNorthward from Mafeking the country grows pretty. At first there are\r\ntrees scattered picturesquely over the undulating pastures and sometimes\r\nforming woods--dry and open woods, yet welcome after the bareness which\r\none has left behind. Here we passed the tiny group of houses called\r\nPitsani, little dreaming that three months later it would become famous\r\nas the place where the Matabililand police were marshalled, and from\r\nwhich they started on their ill-starred march into the Transvaal, whose\r\nbare and forbidding hills we saw a few miles away to the east. Presently\r\nthe ground becomes rougher, and the track winds among and under a\r\nsuccession of abrupt kopjes (pronounced \"koppies\"), mostly of granitic\r\nor gneissose rock. One is surprised that a heavy coach, and still\r\nheavier waggons, can so easily traverse such a country, for the road is\r\nonly a track, for which art has done nothing save in cutting a way\r\nthrough the trees. It is one of the curious features of South Africa\r\nthat the rocky hills have an unusual faculty for standing detached\r\nenough from one another to allow wheeled vehicles to pass between them,\r\nand the country is so dry that morasses, the obstacle which a driver\r\nchiefly fears in most countries, are here, for three-fourths of the\r\nyear, not feared at all. This region of bold, craggy hills, sparsely\r\nwooded, usually rising only some few hundred feet out of the plateau\r\nitself, which is about 4000 feet above the sea, continues for about\r\nthirty miles. To it there succeeds a long stretch of flat land along the\r\nbanks of the sluggish Notwani, the only perennial river of these parts;\r\nfor the stream which on the map bears the name of Molopo, and runs away\r\nwest into the desert to lose nearly all of its water in the sands, is in\r\nSeptember dry, and one crosses its channel without noticing it. This\r\nNotwani, whose course is marked by a line of trees taller and greener\r\nthan the rest, is at this season no better than a feeble brook, flowing\r\nslowly, with more mud than water. But it contains not only good-sized\r\nfish, the catching of which is the chief holiday diversion of these\r\nparts, but also crocodiles, which, generally dormant during the season\r\nof low water, are apt to obtrude themselves when they are least\r\nexpected, and would make bathing dangerous, were there any temptation to\r\nbathe in such a thick green fluid. That men as well as cattle should\r\ndrink it seems surprising, yet they do,--Europeans as well as\r\nnatives,--and apparently with no bad effects. Below Palla, one hundred\r\nand ninety-five miles north of Mafeking, the Notwani joins the Limpopo,\r\nor Crocodile River, a much larger stream, which has come down from the\r\nTransvaal hills, and winds for nearly a thousand miles to the north and\r\neast before it falls into the Indian Ocean. It is here nearly as wide as\r\nthe Thames at Henley, fordable in some places, and flowing very gently.\r\nThe country all along this part of the road is perfectly flat, and just\r\nafter the wet season very feverish, but it may be traversed with\r\nimpunity from the end of May till December. It is a dull\r\nregion--everywhere the same thin wood, through which one can see for\r\nabout a quarter of a mile in every direction, consisting of two or three\r\nkinds of mimosa, all thorny, and all so spare and starved in their\r\nleafage that one gets little shade beneath them when at the midday halt\r\nshelter has to be sought from the formidable sun. On the parched ground\r\nthere is an undergrowth of prickly shrubs, among which it is necessary\r\nto move with as much care as is needed in climbing a barbed-wire fence.\r\nWhen at night, camping out on the veldt, one gathers brushwood to light\r\nthe cooking-fire, both the clothes and the hands of the novice come\r\nbadly off. Huge ant-hills begin to appear, sometimes fifteen to twenty\r\nfeet high and as many yards in circumference; but these large ones are\r\nall dead and may be of considerable age. In some places they are so high\r\nand steep, and stand so close together, that by joining them with an\r\nearthen rampart a strong fort might be made. When people begin to till\r\nthe ground more largely than the natives now do, the soil heaped up in\r\nthese great mounds will be found most serviceable. It consists of good\r\nmould, very friable, and when spread out over the service ought to prove\r\nfertile. In pulverizing the soil, the ants render here much the same\r\nkind of service which the earthworms do in Europe. There are no flowers\r\nat this season (end of September), and very little grass; yet men say\r\nthat there is no better ranching country in all South Africa, and the\r\noxen which one meets all the way, feeding round the spots where the\r\ntransport-waggons have halted, evidently manage to pick up enough\r\nherbage to support them. The number of ox-waggons is surprising in so\r\nlonely a country, till one remembers that most of the food and drink, as\r\nwell as of the furniture, agricultural and mining tools, and wood for\r\nbuilding,--indeed, most of the necessaries and all the luxuries of life\r\nneeded in Matabililand,--have to be sent up along this road, which is\r\nmore used than the alternative route through the Transvaal from Pretoria\r\n_via_ Pietersburg. No wonder all sorts of articles are costly in\r\nBulawayo, when it has taken eight or ten weeks to bring them from the\r\nnearest railway terminus. The waggons do most of their journeying by\r\nnight, allowing the oxen to rest during the heat of the day. One of the\r\nminor troubles of travel is the delay which ensues when one's vehicle\r\nmeets a string of waggons, sometimes nearly a quarter of a mile long,\r\nfor each has eight, nine, or even ten, span of oxen. They move very\r\nslowly, and at night, when the track happens to be a narrow one among\r\ntrees, it is not easy to get past. Except for these waggons the road is\r\nlonely. One sees few natives, though the narrow footpaths crossing the\r\nwheel-track show that the country is inhabited. Here and there one\r\npasses a large native village, such as Ramoutsie and Machudi, but small\r\nhamlets are rare, and solitary huts still rarer. The country is of\r\ncourse very thinly peopled in proportion to its resources, for, what\r\nwith the good pasture nearly everywhere and the fertile land in many\r\nplaces, it could support eight or ten times the number of Barolongs,\r\nBamangwato, and other Bechuanas who now live scattered over its vast\r\narea. It is not the beasts of prey that are to blame for this, for, with\r\nthe disappearance of game, lions have become extremely scarce, and\r\nleopards and lynxes are no longer common. Few quadrupeds are seen, and\r\nnot many kinds of birds. Vultures, hawks, and a species something like a\r\nmagpie, with four pretty white patches upon the wings and a long tail,\r\nare the commonest, together with bluish-grey guinea-fowl, pigeons and\r\nsometimes a small partridge. In some parts there are plenty of bustards,\r\nprized as dainties, but we saw very few. Away from the track some buck\r\nof the commoner kinds may still be found, and farther to the west there\r\nis still plenty of big game in the Kalahari Desert. But the region which\r\nwe traversed is almost as unattractive to the sportsman as it is to the\r\nlover of beauty. It is, indeed, one of the dullest parts of South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe next stage in the journey is marked by Palapshwye, Khama's capital.\r\nThis is the largest native town south of the Zambesi, for it has a\r\npopulation estimated at over 20,000. It came into being only a few years\r\nago, when Khama, having returned from the exile to which his father had\r\nconsigned him on account of his steadfast adherence to Christianity, and\r\nhaving succeeded to the chieftainship of the Bamangwato, moved the tribe\r\nfrom its previous dwelling-place at Shoshong, some seventy miles to the\r\nsouth-west, and fixed it here. Such migrations and foundations of new\r\ntowns are not uncommon in South Africa, as they were not uncommon in\r\nIndia in the days of the Pathan and Mogul sovereigns, when each new\r\noccupant of the throne generally chose a new residence to fortify or\r\nadorn. Why this particular site was chosen I do not know. It stands\r\nhigh, and is free from malaria, and there are springs of water in the\r\ncraggy hill behind; but the country all round is poor, rocky in some\r\nplaces, sandy in others, and less attractive than some other parts of\r\nBechuanaland. We entered the town late at night, delayed by the deep\r\nsand on the track, and wandered about in the dark for a long while\r\nbefore, after knocking at one hut after another, we could persuade any\r\nnative to come out and show us the way to the little cluster of European\r\ndwellings. The Kafirs are terribly afraid of the night, and fear the\r\nghosts, which are to them the powers of darkness, more than they care\r\nfor offers of money.\r\n\r\nKhama was absent in England, pressing upon the Colonial Office his\r\nobjections to the demand made by the British South Africa Company that\r\nhis kingdom should be brought within the scope of their administration\r\nand a railway constructed through it from Mafeking to Bulawayo. Besides\r\nthe natural wish of a monarch to retain his authority undiminished, he\r\nwas moved by the desire to keep his subjects from the use of\r\nintoxicating spirits, a practice which the establishment of white men\r\namong them would make it difficult, if not impossible, to prevent. The\r\nmain object of Khama's life and rule has been to keep his people from\r\nintoxicants. His feelings were expressed in a letter to a British\r\nCommissioner, in which he said: \"I fear Lo Bengula less than I fear\r\nbrandy. I fought against Lo Bengula and drove him back. He never gives\r\nme a sleepless night. But to fight against drink is to fight against\r\ndemons and not men. I fear the white man's drink more than the assagais\r\nof the Matabili, which kill men's bodies. Drink puts devils into men and\r\ndestroys their souls and bodies.\" Though a Christian himself, and giving\r\nthe missionaries in his dominions every facility for their work, he has\r\nnever attempted to make converts by force. A prohibition of the use of\r\nalcohol, however, has seemed to him to lie \"within the sphere of\r\ngovernmental action,\" and he has, indeed, imperilled his throne by\r\nefforts to prevent the Bamangwato from making and drinking the stronger\r\nkind of Kafir beer, to which, like all natives, they were much\r\naddicted.[44] This beer is made from the so-called \"Kafir-corn\" (a grain\r\nresembling millet, commonly cultivated by the natives), and, though less\r\nstrong than European-made spirits, is more intoxicating than German or\r\neven English ale. Khama's prohibition of it had, shortly before my\r\nvisit, led to a revolt and threatened secession of a part of the tribe\r\nunder his younger brother, Radiclani, and the royal reformer, (himself a\r\nstrict total abstainer), had been compelled to give way, lamenting, in a\r\npathetic speech, that his subjects would not suffer him to do what was\r\nbest for them. Just about the same time, in England, the proposal of a\r\nmeasure to check the use of intoxicating liquors led to the overthrow of\r\na great party and clouded the prospects of any temperance legislation.\r\nAlike in Britain and in Bechuanaland it is no light matter to interfere\r\nwith a people's favourite indulgences. European spirits are, however, so\r\nmuch more deleterious than Kafir beer that Khama still fought hard\r\nagainst their introduction. The British South Africa Company forbids the\r\nsale of intoxicants to natives in its territory, but Khama naturally\r\nfelt that when at railway stations and stores spirits were being freely\r\nconsumed by whites, the difficulty of keeping them from natives would be\r\nlargely increased. The Colonial Office gave leave for the construction\r\nof the railway, and brought Khama into closer relations with the\r\nCompany, while securing to him a large reserve and establishing certain\r\nprovisions for his benefit and that of his people. However, a few months\r\nlater (in the beginning of 1896) the extension of the Company's powers\r\nas to Bechuanaland was recalled, and Khama is now under the direct\r\nprotection of the Imperial Government.\r\n\r\nHis kingdom covers on the map a vast but ill-defined area, stretching on\r\nthe west into the Kalahari Desert, and on the north-west into the thinly\r\npeopled country round Lake Ngami, where various small tribes live in\r\npractical independence. Sovereignty among African natives is tribal\r\nrather than territorial. Khama is the chief of the Bamangwato, rather\r\nthan ruler of a country, and where the Bamangwato dwell there Khama\r\nreigns. A large proportion of them dwell in or near Palapshwye. Born\r\nabout 1830, he is by far the most remarkable Kafir now living in South\r\nAfrica, for he has shown a tact, prudence, and tenacity of purpose which\r\nwould have done credit to a European statesman. He was converted to\r\nChristianity while still a boy, and had much persecution to endure at\r\nthe hands of his heathen father, who at last banished him for refusing\r\nto take a second wife. What is not less remarkable, he has carried his\r\nChristianity into practice, evincing both a sense of honour as well as a\r\nhumanity which has made him the special protector of the old and the\r\nweak, and even of the Bushmen who serve the Bamangwato. Regarded as\r\nfighters, his people are far inferior to the Matabili, and he was often\r\nin danger of being overpowered by the fierce and rapacious Lo Bengula.\r\nAs early as 1862 he crossed assagais with and defeated a Matabili _impi_\r\n(war-band), earning the praise of the grim Mosilikatze, who said, \"Khama\r\nis a man. There is no other man among the Bamangwato.\" Though frequently\r\nthereafter threatened and sometimes attacked, he succeeded, by his\r\nskilful policy, in avoiding any serious war until the fall of Lo Bengula\r\nin 1893. Seeing the tide of white conquest rising all round him, he has\r\nhad a difficult problem to face, and it is not surprising that he has\r\nbeen less eager to welcome the Company and its railway than those who\r\nconsidered him the white man's friend had expected. The coming of the\r\nwhites means not only the coming of liquor, but the gradual occupation\r\nof the large open tracts where the natives have hunted and pastured\r\ntheir cattle, with a consequent change in their mode of life, which,\r\ninevitable as it may be, a patriotic chief must naturally wish to delay.\r\n\r\nPalapshwye, the largest native town south of the Zambesi, is an immense\r\nmass of huts, planted without the smallest attempt at order over the\r\nsandy hill slope, some two square miles in extent. The huts are small,\r\nwith low walls of clay and roofs of grass, so that from a distance the\r\nplace looks like a wilderness of beehives. Each of the chief men has his\r\nown hut and those of his wives inclosed in a rough fence of thorns, or\r\nperhaps of prickly-pear, and between the groups of huts lie open spaces\r\nof sand or dusty tracks. In the middle of the town close to the huts of\r\nKhama himself, who, however, being a Christian, has but one wife, stands\r\nthe great kraal or _kothla_. It is an inclosure some three hundred yards\r\nin circumference, surrounded by a stockade ten feet high, made of dry\r\ntrunks and boughs of trees stuck in the ground so close together that\r\none could not even shoot a gun, or hurl an assagai through them. The\r\nstockade might resist the first attack of native enemies if the rest of\r\nthe town had been captured, but it would soon yield to fire. In the\r\nmiddle of it stands the now dry trunk of an old tree, spared when the\r\nother trees were cut down to make the kraal, because it was supposed to\r\nhave magical powers, and heal those who touched it. A heap of giraffe\r\nskins lay piled against it, but its healing capacity now finds less\r\ncredit, at least among those who wish to stand well with the chief.\r\nWithin this inclosure Khama holds his general assemblies when he has\r\nsome address to deliver to the people or some ordinance to proclaim. He\r\nadministers criminal justice among his subjects, and decides their civil\r\ndisputes, usually with the aid of one or two elderly counsellors. He has\r\ntried to improve their agricultural methods, and being fond of horses\r\nhas formed a good stud. Unhappily, in 1896, the great murrain descended\r\nupon the Bamangwato, and Khama and his tribe lost nearly all the cattle\r\n(said to have numbered eight hundred thousand) in which their wealth\r\nconsisted.\r\n\r\nThe British magistrate--there are about seventy Europeans living in the\r\ntown--described these Bechuanas as a quiet folk, not hard to manage.\r\nThey have less force of character and much less taste for fighting than\r\nZulus or Matabili. The main impression which they leave on a stranger is\r\nthat of laziness. Of the many whom we saw hanging about in the sun,\r\nhardly one seemed to be doing any kind of work. Nor do they. They grow a\r\nfew mealies (maize), but it is chiefly the women who hoe and plant the\r\nground. They know how to handle wire and twist it round the handles of\r\nthe _sjamboks_ (whips of hippopotamus hide). But having few wants and no\r\nambition, they have practically no industries, and spend their lives in\r\nsleeping, loafing, and talking. When one watches such a race, it seems\r\nall the more strange that a man of such remarkable force of character as\r\nKhama should suddenly appear among them.[45]\r\n\r\nFor about sixty miles north-eastward from Palapshwye the country\r\ncontinues dull, dry, and mostly level. After that rocky hills appear,\r\nand in the beds of the larger streams a little water is seen. At Tati,\r\nninety miles from Palapshwye (nearly four hundred from Mafeking), gold\r\nreefs have been worked at intervals for five and twenty years, under a\r\nconcession originally granted (1869), by Lo Bengula, and a little\r\nEuropean settlement has grown up. Here one passes from Bechuanaland into\r\nthe territories which belonged to the Matabili, and now to the British\r\nSouth Africa Company. The country rises and grows more picturesque. The\r\ngrass is greener on the pastures. New trees appear, some of them bearing\r\nbeautiful flowers, and the air is full of tales of lions. For, in\r\nAfrica, where there is more grass there is more game, and where there is\r\nmore game there are more beasts of prey. Lions, we were told, had last\r\nweek dragged a Kafir from beneath a waggon where he was sleeping. Lions\r\nhad been seen yester eve trotting before the coach. Lions would probably\r\nbe seen again to-morrow. But to us the beast was always a lion of\r\nyesterday or a lion of to-morrow, never a lion of to-day. The most\r\ndirect evidence we had of his presence was when, some days later, we\r\nwere shown a horse on which that morning a lion had sprung, inflicting\r\nterrible wounds. The rider was not touched, and galloped the poor animal\r\nback to camp. At Mangwe, a pretty little station with exceptionally bad\r\nsleeping quarters, the romantic part of the country may be said to\r\nbegin. All round there are rocky kopjes, and the track which leads\r\nnorthward follows a line of hollows between them, called the Mangwe\r\nPass, a point which was of much strategical importance in the Matabili\r\nwar of 1893, and became again of so much importance in the recent native\r\nrising (1896) that one of the first acts of the British authorities was\r\nto construct a rough fort in it and place a garrison there. Oddly\r\nenough, the insurgents did not try to occupy it, and thereby cut off the\r\nEnglish in Matabililand from their railway base at Mafeking, the reason\r\nbeing, as I was informed, that the _Molimo_, or prophet, whose\r\nincitements contributed to the insurrection, had told them that it was\r\nby the road through this pass that the white strangers would quit the\r\ncountry for ever.\r\n\r\nA more peaceful spot could not be imagined than the pass was when we\r\npassed through it at 5 A.M., \"under the opening eyelids of the dawn.\"\r\nSmooth green lawns, each surrounded by a fringe of wood, and filled with\r\nthe songs of awakening birds, lay beneath the beetling crags of\r\ngranite,--granite whose natural grey was hidden by brilliant red and\r\nyellow lichens,--and here and there a clear streamlet trickled across\r\nthe path. Climbing to the top of one of these rocky masses, I enjoyed a\r\nsuperb view to north, west, and east, over a wilderness of rugged hills,\r\nwith huge masses of grey rock rising out of a feathery forest, while to\r\nthe north the undulating line, faintly blue in the far distance, marked\r\nthe point where the plateau of central Matabililand begins to decline\r\ntoward the valley of the Zambesi. It was a beautiful prospect both in\r\nthe wild variety of the foreground and in the delicate hues of ridge\r\nafter ridge melting away towards the horizon, and it was all waste and\r\nsilent, as it has been since the world began.\r\n\r\nThe track winds through the hills for some six or eight miles before it\r\nemerges on the more open country. These kopjes, which form a sort of\r\nrange running east-south-east and west-north-west, are the Matoppo\r\nHills, in which the main body of the Matabili and other insurgent\r\nnatives held their ground during the months of April, May and June,\r\n1896. Although the wood is not dense, by no means so hard to penetrate\r\nas the bush or low scrub which baffled the British troops in the early\r\nKafir wars, waged on the eastern border of Cape Colony, still the\r\nground is so very rough, and the tumbled masses of rock which lie round\r\nthe foot of the granite kopjes afford so many spots for hiding, that the\r\nagile native, who knows the ground, had a far better chance against the\r\nfirearms of the white men than he could have had in the open country\r\nwhere the battles of 1893 took place. Seeing such a country one can well\r\nunderstand that it was quite as much by famine as by fighting that the\r\nrising of 1896 was brought to an end.\r\n\r\nFrom the northern end of the Mangwe Pass it is over forty miles to\r\nBulawayo, the goal of our journey, and the starting-point for our return\r\njourney to the coast of the Indian Ocean. But Bulawayo is too important\r\na place to be dealt with at the end of a chapter already sufficiently\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: \"Already night saw all the stars of the other pole, and\r\nours brought so low that it rose not from the surface of the sea.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Called after Constance, wife of Governor Adrian van der\r\nStel.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Nimble climbers will do well to descend from the top down\r\na grand cleft in the rocks, very narrow and extremely steep, which is\r\ncalled the Great Kloof. At its bottom, just behind Cape Town, one sees\r\nin a stream-bed the granite rock on which the horizontal strata of\r\nsandstone that form Table Mountain rest.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Here, in December, 1896, the natives rose in revolt,\r\nexasperated by the slaughter of their cattle, though that slaughter was\r\nthe only method of checking the progress of the cattle plague.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: There is also a weaker kind made, intoxicating only if\r\nconsumed in very large quantity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: For most of what is here stated regarding Khama I am\r\nindebted to an interesting little book by the late Bishop Knight-Bruce,\r\nentitled _Khama, an African Chief_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nFROM BULAWAYO TO FORT SALISBURY--MATABILILAND AND MASHONALAND\r\n\r\n\r\nBulawayo means, in the Zulu tongue, the place of slaughter, and under\r\nthe sway of Lo Bengula it deserved its name. Just sixty years ago\r\nMosilikatze, chief of the Matabili, driven out of what is now the\r\nTransvaal Republic by the Dutch Boers who had emigrated from Cape\r\nColony, fled four hundred miles to the north-west and fell like a sudden\r\ntempest upon the Makalakas and other feeble tribes who pastured their\r\ncattle in this remote region. His tribe was not large, but every man was\r\na tried warrior. The Makalakas were slaughtered or chased away or\r\nreduced to slavery, and when Mosilikatze died in 1870, his son Lo\r\nBengula succeeded to the most powerful kingdom in South Africa after\r\nthat of Cetewayo, chief of the Zulus. Of the native town which grew up\r\nround the king's kraal there is now not a trace--all was destroyed in\r\n1893. The kraal itself, which Lo Bengula fired when he fled away, has\r\ngone, and only one old tree marks the spot where the king used to sit\r\nadministering justice to his subjects. A large part of this justice\r\nconsisted in decreeing death to those among his _indunas_ or other\r\nprominent men who had excited his suspicions or whose cattle he desired\r\nto appropriate. Sometimes he had them denounced--\"smelt out,\" they\r\ncalled it--by the witch-doctors as guilty of practising magic against\r\nhim. Sometimes he dispensed with a pretext, and sent a messenger to the\r\nhut of the doomed man to tell him the king wanted him. The victim, often\r\nignorant of his fate, walked in front, while the executioner, following\r\nclose behind, suddenly dealt him with the _knob-kerry_, or heavy-ended\r\nstick, one tremendous blow, which crushed his skull and left him dead\r\nupon the ground. Women, on the other hand, were strangled.[46] No one\r\ndisputed the despot's will, for the Matabili, like other Zulus, show to\r\ntheir king the absolute submission of soldiers to their general, while\r\nthe less martial tribes, such as the Bechuanas and Basutos, obey the\r\nchief only when he has the sentiment of the tribe behind him. One thing,\r\nhowever, the king could not do. He owned a large part of all the cattle\r\nof the tribe, and he assumed the power to grant concessions to dig for\r\nminerals. But the land belonged to the whole tribe by right of conquest,\r\nand he had no power to alienate it.\r\n\r\nMoved by the associations of the ancient capital, Mr. Rhodes directed\r\nthe residence of the Administrator, Government House, as it is called,\r\nto be built on the site of Lo Bengula's kraal. But the spot was not a\r\nconvenient one for the creation of a European town, for it was a good\r\nway from any stream, and there was believed to be a valuable gold-reef\r\nimmediately under it. Accordingly, a new site was chosen, on somewhat\r\nlower ground, about two miles to the south-west. Here new Bulawayo\r\nstands, having risen with a rapidity rivalling that of a mining-camp in\r\nWestern America. The site has no natural beauty, for the landscape is\r\ndull, with nothing to relieve its monotonous lines except the hill of\r\nTsaba Induna, about fifteen miles distant to the east. The ground on\r\nwhich the town stands, sloping gently to the south, is bare, dusty, and\r\nwind-swept, like the country all round. However, the gum-trees, planted\r\nin the beginning of 1894, when the streets were laid out, had already\r\nshot up to twelve or fifteen feet in height and began to give some\r\nlittle shade. Brick houses were rising here and there among the wooden\r\nshanties and the sheds of corrugated iron. An opera house was talked of,\r\nand already the cricket-ground and racecourse, without which Englishmen\r\ncannot be happy, had been laid out. Town lots, or \"stands,\" as they are\r\ncalled in South Africa, had gone up to prices which nothing but a career\r\nof swift and brilliant prosperity could justify. However, that\r\nprosperity seemed to the inhabitants of Bulawayo to be assured. Settlers\r\nkept flocking in. Storekeepers and hotel-keepers were doing a roaring\r\ntrade. Samples of ore were every day being brought in from newly\r\nexplored gold-reefs, and all men's talk was of pennyweights, or even\r\nounces, to the ton. Everybody was cheerful, because everybody was\r\nhopeful. It was not surprising. There is something intoxicating in the\r\natmosphere of a perfectly new country, with its undeveloped and\r\nundefined possibilities: and the easy acquisition of this spacious and\r\nhealthful land, the sudden rise of this English town, where two years\r\nbefore there had been nothing but the huts of squalid savages, had\r\nfilled every one with a delightful sense of the power of civilized man\r\nto subjugate the earth and draw from it boundless wealth. Perhaps\r\nsomething may also be set down to the climate. Bulawayo is not\r\nbeautiful. Far more attractive sites might have been found among the\r\nhills to the south. But it has a deliciously fresh, keen brilliant air,\r\nwith a strong breeze tempering the sun-heat, and no risk of fever.\r\nIndeed, nearly all this side of Matabililand is healthful, partly\r\nbecause it has been more thickly peopled of late years than the eastern\r\nside of the country, which was largely depopulated by the Matabili\r\nraids.\r\n\r\nNext to the prospects of the gold-reefs (a topic to which I shall\r\npresently return), the question in which a visitor in 1895 felt most\r\ninterest was the condition of the natives. It seemed too much to expect\r\nthat a proud and warlike race of savages should suddenly, within less\r\nthan two years from the overthrow of their king, have abandoned all\r\nnotion of resistance to the whites and settled down as peaceable\r\nsubjects. The whites were a mere handful scattered over an immense area\r\nof country, and the white police force did not exceed four or five\r\nhundred men. Nevertheless, the authorities of the British South Africa\r\nCompany were of opinion that peace had been finally secured, and that no\r\ndanger remained from the natives. They observed that, while the true\r\nMatabili who remained in the country--for some had fled down to or\r\nacross the Zambesi after the defeats of 1893--were comparatively few in\r\nnumber, the other natives, mostly Makalakas,[47] were timid and\r\nunwarlike. They held that when a native tribe has been once completely\r\novercome in fight, it accepts the inevitable with submission. And they\r\ndwelt on the fact that Lo Bengula's tyranny had been a constant source\r\nof terror to his own subjects. After his flight some of his leading\r\nindunas came to Dr. Jameson and said, \"Now we can sleep.\" This\r\nconfidence was shared by all the Europeans in the country. English\r\nsettlers dwelt alone without a shade of apprehension in farms, six,\r\neight, or ten miles from another European. In the journey I am\r\ndescribing from Mafeking to Fort Salisbury, over eight hundred miles of\r\nlonely country, my wife and I were accompanied only by my driver, a\r\nworthy Cape Dutchman named Renske, and by a native \"Cape boy.\" None of\r\nus was armed, and no one of the friends we consulted as to our trip even\r\nsuggested that I should carry so much as a revolver, or that the\r\nslightest risk was involved in taking a lady through the country. How\r\nabsolutely secure the Administrator at Bulawayo felt was shown by his\r\nsending the Matabililand mounted police (those who afterwards marched\r\ninto the Transvaal) to Pitsani, in southern Bechuanaland, in November,\r\nleaving the country denuded of any force to keep order.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to be wise after the event. The confidence of the Europeans\r\nin the submissiveness of the natives is now seen to have been ill\r\nfounded. Causes of discontent were rife among them, which, at first\r\nobscure, became subsequently clear. Two of these causes were already\r\nknown at the time of my visit, though their seriousness was\r\nunder-estimated. In Mashonaland the natives disliked the tax of ten\r\nshillings for each hut, which there, as in the Transvaal Republic,[48]\r\nthey have been required to pay; and they complained that it was apt to\r\nfall heavily on the industrious Kafir, because the idle one escaped,\r\nhaving nothing that could be taken in payment of it. This tax was\r\nsometimes levied in kind, sometimes in labour, but by preference in\r\nmoney when the hut-owner had any money, for the Company desired to\r\ninduce the natives to earn wages. If he had not, an ox was usually taken\r\nin pledge. In Matabililand many natives, I was told, felt aggrieved that\r\nthe Company had claimed the ownership of and the right to take to itself\r\nall the cattle, as having been (in the Company's view) the property of\r\nLo Bengula, although many of these had, in fact, been left in the hands\r\nof the indunas, and a large part were, in December, 1895, distributed\r\namong the natives as their own property. Subsequent inquiries have shown\r\nthat this grievance was deeply and widely felt. As regards the land,\r\nthere was evidently the material out of which a grievance might grow,\r\nbut the grievance did not seem to have yet actually arisen. The land was\r\nbeing sold off in farms, and natives squatting on a piece of land so\r\nsold might be required by the purchaser to clear out. However, pains\r\nwere taken, I was told, to avoid including native villages in any farm\r\nsold. Often it would not be for the purchaser's interest to eject the\r\nnatives, because he might get labourers among them, and labour is what\r\nis most wanted. Two native reservations had been laid out, but the\r\npolicy of the Company was to keep the natives scattered about among the\r\nwhites rather than mass them in the reservations. Under Lo Bengula there\r\nhad been no such thing as private ownership of land. The land was\r\n\"nationalized,\" and no individual Kafir was deemed to have any permanent\r\nand exclusive right even to the piece of it which he might be at the\r\ntime cultivating. While he actually did cultivate he was not disturbed,\r\nfor the simple reason that there was far more land than the people could\r\nor would cultivate. The natives, although they till the soil, are still\r\nhalf-nomads. They often shift their villages, and even when the village\r\nremains they seldom cultivate the same patch for long together. Though\r\nEuropeans had been freely buying the land, they bought largely to hold\r\nfor a rise and sell again, and comparatively few of the farms bought had\r\nbeen actually stocked with cattle, while, of course, the parts under\r\ntillage were a mere trifle. Hence there did not seem to have been as yet\r\nany pressure upon the natives, who, though they vastly outnumber the\r\nEuropeans, are very few in proportion to the size of the country. I\r\ndoubt if in the whole territory of the Company south of the Zambesi\r\nRiver there are 1,000,000. To these possible sources of trouble there\r\nwas added one now perceived to have been still graver. Native labour was\r\nneeded not only for public works, but by private persons for mining\r\noperations. As the number of Kafirs who came willingly was insufficient,\r\nthe indunas were required to furnish stout young men to work; and\r\naccording to Mr. Selous,[49] who was then living in the country, force\r\nwas often used to bring them in. Good wages were given; but the\r\nregulations were irksome, and the native police, who were often employed\r\nto bring in the labourers, seem to have abused their powers. To the\r\ngenuine Matabili, who lived only for war and plunder, and had been\r\naccustomed to despise the other tribes, work, and especially mine work,\r\nwas not only distasteful, but degrading. They had never been really\r\nsubdued. In 1893 they hid away most of the firearms they possessed,\r\nhoping to use them again. Now, when their discontent had increased, two\r\nevents hastened an outbreak. One was the removal of the white police to\r\nPitsani. Only forty-four were left in Matabililand to keep order. The\r\nother was the appearance of a frightful murrain among the cattle, which\r\nmade it necessary for the Company to order the slaughter even of healthy\r\nanimals in order to stop the progress of the contagion. The plague had\r\ncome slowly down through German and Portuguese East Africa, propagated,\r\nit is said, by the wild animals, especially buffaloes. Some kinds of\r\nwild game are as liable to it as domesticated oxen are, and on the Upper\r\nZambesi in September, 1896, so large a part of the game had died that\r\nthe lions, mad with hunger, were prowling round the native kraals and\r\nmaking it dangerous to pass from village to village. This new and\r\nunlooked for calamity created a ferment in the minds of the natives. The\r\nslaughter of their cattle seemed to them an act of injustice. Just when\r\nthey were terrified at this calamity (which, it was reported, had been\r\nsent up among them by Lo Bengula, or his ghost, from the banks of the\r\nZambesi) and incensed at this apparent injustice, coming on the top of\r\ntheir previous visitation, the news of the defeat and surrender of the\r\nCompany's police force in the Transvaal spread among them. They saw the\r\nwhite government defenceless, and its head, Dr. Jameson, whose\r\nkindliness had impressed those who knew him personally, no longer among\r\nthem. Then, under the incitements of a prophet, came the revolt.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a digression. In October, 1895, we travelled, unarmed\r\nand unconcerned, by night as well as by day, through villages where five\r\nmonths later the Kafirs rose and murdered every European within reach.\r\nSo entirely unsuspected was the already simmering disaffection.\r\n\r\nThe native question which occupied Bulawayo in September, 1895, was\r\nthat native-labour question which, in one form or another, is always\r\npresent to South African minds. All hard labour, all rough and unskilled\r\nlabour, is, and, owing to the heat of the climate as well as the\r\nscarcity of white men, must be, done by blacks; and in a new country\r\nlike Matabililand the blacks, though they can sometimes be induced to\r\ntill the land, are most averse to working under ground. They are only\r\nbeginning to use money, and they do not want the things which money\r\nbuys. The wants of a native living with his tribe and cultivating\r\nmealies or Kafir corn are confined to a kaross (skin cloak) or some\r\npieces of cotton cloth. The prospect of leaving his tribe to go and work\r\nin a mine, in order that he may earn wages wherewith he can buy things\r\nhe has no use for, does not at once appeal to him. The white men,\r\nanxious to get to work on the gold-reefs, are annoyed at what they call\r\nthe stupidity and laziness of the native, and usually clamour for\r\nlegislation to compel the natives to come and work, adding, of course,\r\nthat regular labour would be the best thing in the world for the\r\nnatives. Some go so far as to wish to compel them to work at a fixed\r\nrate of wages, sufficient to leave a good profit for the employer.\r\nOthers go even further, and as experience has shown that the native does\r\nnot fear imprisonment as a penalty for leaving his work, desire the\r\ninfliction of another punishment which he does fear--that is, the lash.\r\nSuch monstrous demands seem fitter for the mouths of Spaniards in the\r\nsixteenth century than for Englishmen in the nineteenth. The difficulty\r\nof getting labour is incident to a new country, and must be borne with.\r\nIn German East Africa it has been so much felt that the Administrator of\r\nthat region has proposed to import Indian labour, as the sugar-planters\r\nof Natal, and as those of Trinidad and Demerara in the West Indies, have\r\nalready done. But it is to some extent a transitory difficulty. The\r\nmines at Kimberley succeed in drawing plenty of native labour; so do\r\nthe mines on the Witwatersrand; so in time the mine-owners in\r\nMatabililand may hope to do also. They must, however, be prepared, until\r\na regular afflux of labourers has been set up, to offer, as the\r\nKimberley people do, wages far in excess of anything the Kafirs could\r\npossibly gain among their own people, in order to overcome the distaste\r\nof the native--a very natural distaste, due to centuries of indolence in\r\na hot climate--to any hard and continuous toil. This is no great\r\ncompensation to make to those whose land they have taken and whose\r\nprimitive way of life they have broken up and for ever destroyed. But\r\nonce the habit of coming to work for wages has been established in these\r\nnorthern regions,--and it need not take many years to establish it,--the\r\nmining companies will have no great difficulty in getting as much labour\r\nas they want, and will not be obliged, as they now are, to try to\r\narrange with a chief for the despatch of some of his \"boys.\"\r\n\r\nBulawayo is the point from which one starts to visit the Victoria Falls\r\non the Zambesi, the only very grand natural object which South Africa\r\nhas to show. The expedition, however, is a much longer one than a glance\r\nat the map would suggest. Owing to the prevalence of the tsetse-fly in\r\nthe valley of the great river, one cannot take oxen without the prospect\r\nof losing them, and must therefore travel on foot or with donkeys. The\r\nwant of a waggon makes camping out much more troublesome and involves a\r\nlarge force of native porters. Thus elaborate preparations are needed,\r\nand though the distance, as the crow flies, from Bulawayo to the Falls\r\nis only some two hundred miles, at least six weeks are needed for the\r\ntrip, a space of time we could not spare.\r\n\r\nI have described in the last chapter the route from Cape Town to the\r\ncapital of Matabililand which persons coming from England would\r\nnaturally take. It is not, however, by any means the shortest route to\r\nthe sea, and is therefore not the route along which the bulk of the\r\nEuropean trade is likely in future to pass. From Cape Town to Bulawayo\r\nit is fourteen hundred miles; but from Bulawayo to the port of Beira, on\r\nthe Indian Ocean, it is only six hundred and fifty miles _via_ Fort\r\nSalisbury and Mtali, and will be only about five hundred if a more\r\ndirect railway line should ever be laid out. I propose to take the\r\nreader back to the sea at Beira by this Fort Salisbury and Mtali route,\r\nand in following it he will learn something about Mashonaland and the\r\nmountains which divide British from Portuguese territory.\r\n\r\nBulawayo is distant from Fort Salisbury two hundred and eighty miles.\r\nThe journey takes by coach four days and four nights, travelling night\r\nand day, with only short halts for meals. An ox-waggon accomplishes it\r\nin about three weeks. The track runs nearly all the way along high\r\nground, open, breezy, and healthful, because dry, but seldom\r\npicturesque. It is a land of rolling downs, the tops of which are\r\ncovered with thin grass, while better pastures, and sometimes woods\r\nalso, are found in the valleys of the streams and on the lower slopes of\r\nthe hills. The first part of the way, from Bulawayo to the little town\r\nof Gwelo, is rather dull. One crosses the Bimbezi River, where the\r\nMatabili were finally overthrown in the war of 1893, and the\r\nShangani[50] River, where they suffered their first defeat. The\r\nCompany's force was advancing along the high open ground to attack\r\nBulawayo, and the native army met them on the road. Both battlefields\r\nare bare and open, and one wonders at the folly of the natives who\r\nadvanced over such ground, exposed to the rifle-fire and the still more\r\ndeadly Maxim guns of the invaders. Armed in large part only with\r\nassagais, they were mown down before they could even reach the front of\r\nthe British line, and their splendid courage made their destruction all\r\nthe more complete. Had they stuck to the rocky and woody regions they\r\nmight have made the war a far longer and more troublesome business than\r\nit proved to be. No stone marks either battle-field.\r\n\r\nFrom a spot between the two rivers we turned off to the south to visit\r\nthe prehistoric remains at Dhlodhlo. It was an extremely lonely track,\r\non which we did not meet a human being for some thirty miles. No house,\r\nnot even a Kafir hut, was to be found, so we bivouacked in the veldt, to\r\nthe lee of a clump of thorn-bushes. The earlier part of the nights is\r\ndelightful at this season (October), but it is apt to get cold between 2\r\nand 4 A.M., and as there is usually a south-east wind blowing, the\r\nshelter of a bush or a tall ant-hill is not unwelcome. Whoever enjoys\r\ntravelling at all cannot but enjoy such a night alone under the stars.\r\nOne gathers sticks to make the fire, and gets to know which wood burns\r\nbest. One considers how the scanty supply of water which the waggon\r\ncarries may be most thriftily used for making the soup, boiling the eggs\r\nand brewing the tea. One listens (we listened in vain) for the roar of a\r\ndistant lion or the still less melodious voice of the hyena. The\r\nbrilliance of the stars is such that only the fatigue of the long\r\nday--for one must always start by or before sunrise to spare the animals\r\nduring the sultry noon--and the difficulty of sitting down in a great,\r\nbare, flat land, where there is not a large stone and seldom even a\r\ntree, can drive one into the vehicle to sleep. The meals, consisting of\r\ntinned meat and biscuits, with eggs and sometimes a small, lean, and\r\ndesiccated chicken, are very scanty and very monotonous, but the air is\r\nso dry and fresh and bracing that one seems to find meat and drink in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNext day we came, at the foot of the Matoppo Hills, to a solitary farm,\r\nwhere we found a bright young Englishman, who, with only one white\r\ncompanion, had established himself in this wilderness and was raising\r\ngood crops on fields to which he brought water from a neighbouring\r\nstreamlet. Even the devastation wrought by a flight of locusts had not\r\ndispirited him nor diminished his faith in the country. It is not the\r\nleast of the pleasures of such a journey that one finds so many cheery,\r\nhearty, sanguine young fellows scattered about this country, some of\r\nthem keeping or helping to keep stores, some of them, like our friend\r\nhere, showing what the soil may be made to do with skill and\r\nperseverance, and how homes may be reared upon it. One is always\r\nhospitably received; one often finds in the hard-working pioneer or the\r\nyouth behind the store counter a cultivated and thoughtful mind; one\r\nhas, perhaps, a glimpse of an attractive personality developing itself\r\nunder simple yet severe conditions, fitted to bring out the real force\r\nof a man. After half an hour's talk you part as if you were parting with\r\nan old friend, yet knowing that the same roof is not likely ever to\r\ncover both of you again. There are, of course, rough and ill-omened\r\nexplorers and settlers in South Africa, as in other new countries: but\r\nhaving wandered a good deal, in different countries, on the outer edge\r\nof civilization, I was struck by the large proportion of well-mannered\r\nand well-educated men whom one came across in this tropical wilderness.\r\n\r\nFrom the young Englishman's farm we turned in among the hills, following\r\nthe course of the brook, and gently rising till we reached a height from\r\nwhich a superb view to the north unrolled itself. The country was\r\ncharming, quite unlike the dull brown downs of yesterday. On each side\r\nwere steep hills, sometimes rocky, sometimes covered thick with wood;\r\nbetween them in the valley a succession of smooth, grassy glades, each\r\ncircled round by trees. It was rural scenery--scenery in which one could\r\nwish to build a cottage and dwell therein, or in which a pastoral drama\r\nmight be laid. There was nothing to suggest Europe, for the rocks and,\r\nstill more, the trees were thoroughly African in character, and the air\r\neven drier and keener than that of Sicily. But the landscape was one\r\nwhich any lover of Theocritus might have come to love; and some day,\r\nwhen there are large towns in Matabililand, and plenty of Englishmen\r\nliving in them, the charm of these hills will be appreciated. The valley\r\nrises at last to a grassy table-land, where, on a boss of granite rock,\r\nstand the ancient walls of Dhlodhlo, which we had come to see. I have\r\nalready described the ruins (see Chapter IX), which are scanty enough,\r\nand interesting, not from any beauty they possess, but because we have\r\nso few data for guessing at their purpose or the race that built them.\r\nThe country is now very solitary, and the natives fear to approach the\r\nruins, especially at night, believing them to be haunted. Having spent\r\nsome hours in examining them, we were just starting when a swarm of\r\nlocusts passed, the first we had seen. It is a strange sight, beautiful\r\nif you can forget the destruction it brings with it. The whole air, to\r\ntwelve or even eighteen feet above the ground, is filled with the\r\ninsects, reddish brown in body, with bright gauzy wings. When the sun's\r\nrays catch them it is like the sea sparkling with light. When you see\r\nthem against a cloud they are like the dense flakes of a driving\r\nsnow-storm. You feel as if you had never before realized immensity in\r\nnumber. Vast crowds of men gathered at a festival, countless tree-tops\r\nrising along the slope of a forest ridge, the chimneys of London houses\r\nfrom the top of St. Paul's,--all are as nothing to the myriads of\r\ninsects that blot out the sun above and cover the ground beneath and\r\nfill the air whichever way one looks. The breeze carries them swiftly\r\npast, but they come on in fresh clouds, a host of which there is no end,\r\neach of them a harmless creature which you can catch and crush in your\r\nhand, but appalling in their power of collective devastation. Yet here\r\nin southern Matabililand there had been only a few swarms. We were to\r\nsee later on, in the eastern mountain region, far more terrible\r\nevidences of their presence.\r\n\r\nFrom Dhlodhlo we drove to the store on the Shangani River, a distance of\r\ntwenty miles or more, right across the open veldt, finding our way, with\r\nthe aid of a native boy, over stony hills and thick shrubs, and even\r\nhere and there across marshy stream beds, in a way which astonishes the\r\nEuropean accustomed to think that roads, or at least beaten tracks, are\r\nessential to four-wheeled vehicles. I have driven in an open cart across\r\nthe central watershed of the Rocky Mountains; but the country there,\r\nrough as it is, is like a paved road compared with some parts of the\r\nveldt over which the South African guides his team. Once or twice we\r\nmissed the way in the deepening twilight, and began to prepare ourselves\r\nfor another night under the stars, with a nearly exhausted food-supply.\r\nBut at last, just as darkness fell, we reached a native village, and\r\nobtained (with difficulty) a native guide for the last few miles of the\r\ndrive. These miles were lighted by a succession of grass-fires. Such\r\nfires are much commoner here than in the prairies of Western America,\r\nand, happily, much less dangerous, for the grass is usually short and\r\nthe fire moves slowly. They are sometimes accidental, but more\r\nfrequently lighted by the natives for the sake of getting a fresh growth\r\nof young grass on the part burned and thereby attracting the game.\r\nSometimes the cause is even slighter. The Kafirs are fond of eating the\r\nmice and other small inhabitants of the veldt, and they fire the grass\r\nto frighten these little creatures, and catch them before they can reach\r\ntheir holes, with the further convenience of having them ready roasted.\r\nThus at this season nearly half the land on these downs is charred, and\r\nevery night one sees the glow of a fire somewhere in the distance. The\r\npractice strikes a stranger as a wasteful one, exhausting to the soil,\r\nand calculated to stunt the trees, because, though the grass is too\r\nshort to make the fire strong enough to kill a well-grown tree, it is\r\nquite able to injure the younger ones and prevent them from ever\r\nreaching their due proportions.\r\n\r\nThe term \"store,\" which I have just used, requires some explanation.\r\nThere are, of course, no inns in the country, except in the three or\r\nfour tiny towns. Outside these, sleeping quarters are to be had only in\r\nsmall native huts, built round a sort of primitive \"general shop\" which\r\nsome trader has established to supply the wants of those who live within\r\nfifty miles or who pass along the road. The hut is of clay, with a roof\r\nof thatch, which makes it cooler than the store with its roof of\r\ngalvanised iron. White ants are usually at work upon the clay walls,\r\nsending down little showers of dust upon the sleeper. Each hut contains\r\ntwo rough wooden frames, across which there is stretched, to make a bed,\r\na piece of coarse linen or ticking. Very prudent people turn back the\r\ndirty rug or bit of old blanket which covers the bed, and cast a glance\r\nupon the clay floor, to see that no black _momba_ or other venomous\r\nsnake is already in possession. Such night quarters may seem\r\nunattractive, but we had many a good night's rest in them. When they are\r\nunattainable one camps out.\r\n\r\nFrom the Shangani River to Gwelo the track leads again over a succession\r\nof huge, swelling ridges, separated from one another by the valleys of\r\n_spruits_, or streams, now nearly dry, but in the wet season running\r\nfull and strong. The descent to the spruit, which is often a short,\r\nsteep pitch and is then called a donga, needs careful driving, and the\r\nascent up the opposite bank is for a heavy waggon a matter of great\r\ndifficulty. We passed waggons hardly advancing a step, though eight or\r\nnine span of oxen were tugging at them, and sometimes saw two three span\r\ndetached from another team and attached to the one which had failed,\r\nunaided, to mount the slope. No wonder that, when the difficulty of\r\nbringing up machinery is so great, impatient mine-owners long for the\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\nThe first sign that we were close upon Gwelo came from the sight of a\r\nnumber of white men in shirt-sleeves running across a meadow--an unusual\r\nsight in South Africa, which presently explained itself as the English\r\ninhabitants engaged in a cricket match. Nearly the whole town was either\r\nplaying or looking on. It was a hot afternoon, but our energetic\r\ncountrymen were not to be scared by the sun from the pursuit of the\r\nnational game. They are as much Englishmen in Africa as in England, and,\r\nhappily for them and for their country, there is no part of the national\r\ncharacter that is more useful when transplanted than the fondness for\r\nactive exercise. Gwelo, a cheerful little place, though it stands in a\r\nrather bleak country, with a wooded ridge a little way off to the south,\r\ninterested me as a specimen of the newest kind of settlement. It is not\r\nin strictness a mining camp, for there are no reefs in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood, but a mining centre, which proposes to live as the local\r\nmetropolis of a gold-bearing district, a place of supply and seat of\r\nlocal administration. In October, 1895, it had about fifteen houses\r\ninhabited by Europeans and perhaps thirty houses altogether; but the\r\nmaterials for building other houses were already on the ground, and the\r\nusual symptoms of a \"boom\" were discernible. Comparing it with the many\r\nsimilar \"new cities\" I had seen in Western America, I was much struck\r\nwith the absence of the most conspicuous features of those cities--the\r\n\"saloons\" and \"bars.\" In California or Montana these establishments, in\r\nwhich the twin deities of gambling and drinking are worshipped with\r\nequal devotion, form half the houses of a recent settlement in a mining\r\nregion. In South Africa, except at and near Johannesburg, one scarcely\r\nsees them. Drinking rarely obtrudes itself. What gambling there may be I\r\nknow not, but at any rate there are no gambling-saloons. Nothing can be\r\nmore decorous than the aspect of these new African towns, and the\r\nconduct of the inhabitants seldom belies the aspect. There is, of\r\ncourse, a free use of alcohol. But there is no shooting, such as goes on\r\nin American mining towns: crimes of violence of any kind are extremely\r\nrare; and the tracks are safe. No one dreams of taking the precautions\r\nagainst \"road-agents\" (_i.e._ highwaymen) which are still far from\r\nsuperfluous in the Western States and were far from superfluous in\r\nAustralia. Trains are not stopped and robbed; coaches are not \"held up.\"\r\nNothing surprised me more, next to the apparent submissiveness of the\r\nnative Kafirs, than the order which appeared to prevail among the\r\nwhites. A little reflection shows that in this northerly part of the\r\ncountry, where travelling is either very slow or very costly and\r\ndifficult, malefactors would have few chances of escape. But I do not\r\nthink this is the chief cause of the orderly and law-abiding habits of\r\nthe people. There have never been any traditions of violence, still less\r\nof crime, in South Africa, except as against the natives. The Dutch\r\nBoers were steady, solid people, little given to thieving or to killing\r\none another. The English have carried with them their respect for law\r\nand authority. In some respects their ethical standard is not that of\r\nthe mother country. But towards one another and towards those set in\r\nauthority over them, their attitude is generally correct.\r\n\r\nThe night we spent at Gwelo gave a curious instance of the variability\r\nof this climate. The evening had been warm, but about midnight the S.E.\r\nwind rose, bringing a thin drizzle of rain, and next morning the cold\r\nwas that of Boston or Edinburgh in a bitter north-easter. Having\r\nfortunately brought warm cloaks and overcoats, we put on all we had and\r\nfastened the canvas curtains round the vehicle. Nevertheless, we\r\nshivered all day long, the low thick clouds raining at intervals, and\r\nthe malign blast chilling one's bones. Gwelo, of course, declared that\r\nsuch weather was quite exceptional; but those can have travelled little\r\nindeed who have not remarked how often they encounter \"exceptional\r\nweather,\" and Gwelo, having existed for eighteen months only, had at\r\nbest a small experience to fall back upon. The moral for travellers is:\r\n\"Do not forget to take your furs and your ulsters to tropical South\r\nAfrica.\"\r\n\r\nSome forty miles beyond Gwelo there is a mountain called Iron Mine Hill,\r\nwhere the Mashonas have for generations been wont to find and work iron.\r\nAll or nearly all the Kafir tribes do this, but the Mashonas are more\r\nskilful at it than were their conquerors the Matabili. Here a track\r\nturns off to the south-east to Fort Victoria, the first military post\r\nestablished by the Company in its territories, and for a time the most\r\nimportant. It has fallen into the background lately, partly because the\r\ngold-reefs have not realized the hopes once formed of them, partly\r\nbecause it suffers from fever after the rains. I went to it because from\r\nit one visits the famous ruins at Zimbabwye, the most curious relic of\r\nprehistoric antiquity yet discovered in tropical Africa. The journey,\r\none hundred miles from Iron Mine Hill to Victoria, is not an easy one,\r\nfor there are no stores on the way where either provisions or\r\nnight-quarters can be had, and the track is a bad one, being very little\r\nused. The country is well wooded and often pretty, with fantastic, rocky\r\nhills rising here and there, but presenting few striking features. Two\r\nviews, however, dwell in my recollection as characteristic of South\r\nAfrica. We had slept in a rude hut on the banks of the Shashi River,\r\nimmediately beneath a rocky kopje, and rose next morning before dawn to\r\ncontinue the journey. Huge rocks piled wildly upon one another towered\r\nabove the little meadow--rocks covered with lichens of brilliant hues,\r\nred, green, and yellow, and glowing under the rays of the level sun.\r\nGlossy-leaved bushes nestled in the crevices and covered the mouths of\r\nthe dens to which the leopards had retired from their nocturnal prowls.\r\nOne tree stood out against the clear blue on the top of the highest\r\nrock. Cliff-swallows darted and twittered about the hollows, while high\r\noverhead, in the still morning air, two pairs of large hawks sailed in\r\nwide circles round and round the summit of the hill. A few miles farther\r\nthe track crossed a height from which one could gaze for thirty miles in\r\nevery direction over a gently rolling country covered with wood, but\r\nwith broad stretches of pasture interposed, whose grass, bleached to a\r\nlight yellow, made one think it a mass of cornfields whitening to\r\nharvest. Out of these woods and fields rose at intervals what seemed the\r\ntowers and spires of cities set upon hills. We could have fancied\r\nourselves in central Italy, surveying from some eminence like Monte\r\nAmiata the ancient towns of Tuscany and Umbria rising on their rocky\r\nheights out of chestnut woods and fields of ripening corn. But the city\r\ntowers were only piles of grey rock, and over the wide horizon there was\r\nnot a sign of human life--only the silence and loneliness of an\r\nuntouched wilderness.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Victoria, where the war of 1893 began by a raid of the young\r\nMatabili warriors upon the Mashona tribes, who were living under the\r\nprotection of the Company, it is seventeen miles to Zimbabwye. The track\r\nleads through a pretty country, with alternate stretches of wood and\r\ngrass, bold hills on either side, and blue peaked mountains in the\r\ndistance. Crossing a low, bare ridge of granite, one sees nearly a mile\r\naway, among thick trees, a piece of grey wall, and when one comes\r\nnearer, what seems the top of a tower just peeping over the edge of the\r\nwall. It is Zimbabwye--a wall of loose but well trimmed and neatly\r\nfitted pieces of granite surrounding an elliptical inclosure; within\r\nthis inclosure other half-ruined walls over-grown by shrubs and trees,\r\nand a strange solid tower or pillar thirty feet high, built, without\r\nmortar, of similar pieces of trimmed granite.[51] This is all that\r\nthere is to see. One paces to and fro within the inclosure and measures\r\nthe width and length of the passages between the walls. One climbs the\r\ngreat inclosing wall at a point where part of it has been broken down,\r\nand walks along the broad top, picking one's way over the stems of\r\nclimbing shrubs, which thrust themselves across the wall from beneath or\r\ngrow rooted in its crevices. One looks and looks again, and wonders. But\r\nthere is nothing to show whether this grey wall is three centuries or\r\nthirty centuries old. There is no architectural style, no decoration\r\neven, except a rudely simple pattern on the outside of the wall which\r\nfaces the east; so there is nothing by which one can connect this\r\ntemple, if it is a temple, with the buildings of any known race or\r\ncountry. In this mystery lies the charm of the spot--in this and in the\r\nremoteness and silence of a country which seems to have been always as\r\nit is to-day. One mark of modern man, and one only, is to be seen. In\r\nthe middle of the valley, some three hundred yards from the great\r\nbuilding, Mr. Cecil Rhodes has erected a monument to Major Wilson and\r\nthe thirty-seven troopers who fell with him on the Lower Shangani River\r\nin December, 1893, fighting gallantly to the last against an\r\noverwhelming force of Matabili. The monument stands on an eminence\r\nsurrounded by the broken wall of some ancient stronghold. It has been\r\nwisely placed far enough from the great ruin not to form an incongruous\r\nelement in the view of the latter, and it was an imaginative thought to\r\ncommemorate, at a spot in this new land which bears witness to a race of\r\nprehistoric conquerors, the most striking incident in the history of the\r\nlatest conquest.\r\n\r\nWe climbed the rocky height, where the skilfully constructed walls of\r\nthe ancient fort show that those who built Zimbabwye lived in fear of\r\nenemies. We sat beside the spring, a clear though not copious spring,\r\nwhich rises a little to the south of the great building from a fissure\r\nin the rock. Fountains so clear are rare in this country, and the\r\nexistence of this one probably determined the site of the great building\r\nitself. It flows into a small pool, and is then lost, being too small to\r\nform a rivulet. No trace of man's hand is seen round it or on the margin\r\nof the pool, but those who worshipped in the temple of Zimbabwye\r\ndoubtless worshipped this fountain also, for that is one of the oldest\r\nand most widely diffused forms of worship in the world. Restless nature\r\nwill some day overthrow the walls of the temple, which she is piercing\r\nwith the roots of shrubs and entwining with the shoots of climbing wild\r\nvines, and then only the fountain will be left.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Victoria to Fort Salisbury it is nearly two hundred miles, the\r\ncountry generally level, though studded, like parts of southern India,\r\nwith isolated rocky hills, whose crags of granite or gneiss break under\r\nthe sun and rain into strange and fantastic shapes. A people\r\nsufficiently advanced to erect fortifications might have made for\r\nthemselves impregnable strongholds out of the tops of these kopjes. The\r\ntimid Makalakas have in many places planted their huts in the midst of\r\nthe huge detached masses into which the kopjes are cleft; but they have\r\nnot known how to make their villages defensible, and have been content\r\nwith piling up a few loose stones to close some narrow passage between\r\nthe rocks, or surrounding their huts with a rough fence of thorn-bushes.\r\nWe found one deserted village where upon each loose block there had been\r\nplaced a rude erection of clay, covered at the top, and apparently\r\nintended for the storing of grain. Thus raised from the ground it was\r\nsafer from wild beasts and from rain. All the dwelling huts but two had\r\nbeen burned. We entered these, and found the walls covered with the\r\nrudest possible representations of men and animals, drawn with charcoal,\r\nmore coarsely than an average child of ten would draw, and far inferior\r\nin spirit to the figures which the Lapps of Norway will draw on a\r\nreindeer horn spoon, or the Red Indians of Dakota upon a calico cloak.\r\nWhether the village had perished by an accidental fire, or whether its\r\ninhabitants, relieved from that terror of the Matabili which drove them\r\nto hide amongst the rocks, had abandoned it for some spot in the plain\r\nbelow, there was no one to tell us. One curious trace of insecurity\r\nremained in a dry and light tree-trunk, which had been left standing\r\nagainst the side of a flat-topped rock some thirty feet high, with the\r\nlowest dozen feet too steep to be climbed. It had evidently served as a\r\nsort of ladder. By it the upper part of the rock might be gained, and\r\nwhen it had been pulled up, approach was cut off and the fugitives on\r\nthe flat top might be safe, while the Matabili were plundering their\r\nstores of grain and killing their friends beneath.\r\n\r\nAll this eastern side of the country was frequently raided by the\r\nMatabili, whose home lay farther west towards Bulawayo. The Makalakas\r\ncould offer no resistance, not only because they were poor fighters, but\r\nalso because they were without cohesion. The clans were small and obeyed\r\nno common overlord. Most of the villages lived quite unconnected with\r\none another, yielding obedience, often a doubtful obedience, to their\r\nown chief, but caring nothing for any other village. Among savages the\r\nascendency of a comparatively numerous tribe which is drilled to fight,\r\nand which renders implicit obedience to its chief, is swift and\r\ncomplete. The Matabili when they entered this country had probably only\r\nten or twelve thousand fighting men; but they conquered it without the\r\nslightest difficulty, for the inhabitants, though far more numerous,\r\nwere divided into small communities, and did not attempt to offer any\r\ncollective resistance. Then for more than half a century slaughter and\r\npillage reigned over a tract of some ninety thousand square miles. Much\r\nof this tract, especially the eastern part, which we call Mashonaland,\r\nwas well peopled by tribes who lived quietly, had plenty of cattle,\r\ntilled the soil, and continued to dig a little gold, as their\r\nforefathers had done for centuries. They were now mercilessly raided by\r\nthe Matabili all the way from Lake Ngami on the west to the edge of the\r\ngreat plateau on the east, till large districts were depopulated and\r\nleft desolate, the grown men having been all killed or chased away, the\r\nchildren either killed, or made slaves of, or taken as recruits into the\r\nMatabili army. Constant war and the sanguinary government of Lo Bengula\r\nreduced the number of the true Matabili, so that such recruiting became\r\na necessity. Their successes filled the Matabili with an overweening\r\nconfidence in their power. Through all South Africa they despised every\r\nnative tribe, except that martial one which was ruled by Gungunhana on\r\nthe eastern frontier of Mashonaland, and despised even the white men,\r\nthinking them but a handful. The indunas, who had visited London in\r\n1891, endeavoured to warn them of the resources of the whites, and Lo\r\nBengula himself was opposed to war. But the young braves, who, like\r\nCetewayo's Zulus, desired to \"wash their spears,\" overbore the\r\nreluctance of the monarch, only to perish in the war of 1893.\r\n\r\nTowards Fort Salisbury the country rises and grows prettier as it shows\r\nsigns of a more copious rainfall. New flowers appear, and the grass is\r\ngreener. About twelve miles before the town is reached one crosses a\r\nconsiderable stream with a long, deep, clear pool among rocks, and is\r\ntold of the misadventure of an English doctor who, after a hasty plunge\r\ninto the pool, was drying himself on a flat stone just above the water\r\nwhen a crocodile suddenly raised its hideous snout, seized his leg in\r\nits jaws, and dragged him down. Fortunately his companions were close at\r\nhand and succeeded after a struggle in forcing the beast to drop its\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nThe town itself is built at the foot of a low, wooded hill, on the top\r\nof which stood the original fort, hastily constructed of loose stones in\r\n1890, and occupied in serious earnest for defence during the Matabili\r\nwar. It spreads over a wide space of ground, with houses scattered here\r\nand there, and has become, since the draining of the marshy land on the\r\nbanks of a streamlet which runs through it, free from malaria and quite\r\nhealthy. Though the sun heat was great in the end of October (for one is\r\nonly eighteen degrees from the equator), the air was so fresh and dry\r\nthat I could walk for miles in the full blaze of noon, and the nights\r\nwere too cool to sit out on the _stoep_ (the wooden verandah which one\r\nfinds at the front of every South African house) without an overcoat.\r\nJust round the town the country is open and grassy, but the horizon in\r\nevery direction is closed by woods. The views are far prettier than\r\nthose from Bulawayo, and the position of the town makes it a better\r\ncentre for the administration as well as the commerce of the Company's\r\nterritories. It is only two hundred and twenty miles from the Zambesi at\r\nTete, and only three hundred and seventy from the port of Beira. The\r\nCompany did well to encourage the growth of Bulawayo immediately after\r\nthe conquest of 1893, because it was necessary to explore and to\r\nestablish order in the newest parts of its territory. But in the long\r\nrun, and especially when the regions north of the Zambesi begin to be\r\npractically occupied, Bulawayo, standing in a corner of the country,\r\nwill have to yield to the more imperial site of Fort Salisbury. The\r\ndistrict which lies round the latter town is better watered than western\r\nMatabililand, and the soil richer both for pasture and for tillage. The\r\nrainfall for the year ending April, 1890, reached fifty-three inches,\r\nand the average is about forty.\r\n\r\nFort Salisbury is three years older than Bulawayo, and therefore much\r\nmore advanced. It has even several churches. There is a colony of East\r\nIndians, who grow vegetables and get very high prices for them; and a\r\nconsiderable trade is done in supplying the needs of the mining\r\ndistricts to the north and west. Many gold-reefs lie out in those\r\ndirections, and great hopes are entertained of their future, though at\r\nthe time of my visit people were much busier in floating new companies\r\nto develop the mines than in taking steps for their actual development.\r\nSome very pretty country residences, in the style of Indian bungalows,\r\nhave been built on the skirts of the wood a mile or two from the town;\r\nand street-lamps now light people to their homes along paths where four\r\nyears ago lions were still encountered. The last lion recoiling in\r\ndismay from the first street lamp would be a good subject for a picture\r\nto illustrate the progress of Mashonaland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: A singular story was told me regarding the death of Lo\r\nBengula's sister. She had enjoyed great influence with him, but when he\r\ntook to wife the two daughters of Gungunhana, the great chief (of Zulu\r\nstock) who lived to the eastward beyond the Sabi River, she resented so\r\nbitterly the precedence accorded to them as to give the king constant\r\nannoyance. At last, after several warnings, he told her that if she\r\npersisted in making herself disagreeable he would have her put to death.\r\nHaving consulted the prophet of the Matoppo Hills, who told her she\r\nwould be killed, she cheerfully accepted this way out of the difficulty,\r\nand was accordingly sent away and strangled.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: The original inhabitants of the country, belonging to the\r\ntribes which we, following the Portuguese, call Makalanga or Makalaka,\r\nare called by the Matabili (themselves Zulus) Masweni. The name Maholi,\r\noften also applied to them, is said to mean \"outsiders,\" _i.e._,\r\nnon-Zulus. Though many had been drafted as boys into the Matabili\r\nregiments, and others were used as slaves, many more dwelt in the\r\ncountry west and north-west of Bulawayo. Mashonaland, to the east, is\r\npeopled by cognate tribes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: A hut is usually allotted to each wife, and thus this\r\nimpost falls heavily on the polygamist chief, being, in fact, a tax upon\r\nluxuries. I was told that in the Transvaal some of the richer natives\r\nwere trying to escape it by putting two wives in the same hut.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: See his book, published in the end of 1896, entitled\r\n_Sunshine and Storm in Rhodesia_. I do not gather from it how far, in\r\nhis opinion, what went on was known to the higher officials.\r\n\r\nIn a Report presented to Parliament in 1897, Sir Richard Martin states\r\nthat although there was no regulation allowing forced labour, force was,\r\nin fact, used to bring the natives from their kraals to work, and that\r\nthe irritation thus caused did much to provoke the outbreak. The Company\r\nin a reply which they have published do not admit this. I have no data,\r\nother than the Report, for pronouncing an opinion on the responsibility\r\nof the officials; but there seems to be no doubt that, both in this and\r\nin other respects, many of the native police behaved badly, and that the\r\nexperiment of employing them, which seemed to have much to recommend it,\r\ndid in fact fail.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: The Shangani is here a very small stream. It was far away\r\nto the north, on the lower course of the same stream, that Major Wilson\r\nand his party perished later in the war.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: These ruins have been described in Chapter IX.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nFROM FORT SALISBURY TO THE SEA--MANICALAND AND THE PORTUGUESE\r\nTERRITORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Africa, moisture is everything. It makes the difference between\r\nfertility and barrenness; it makes the difference between a cheerful and\r\na melancholy landscape. As one travels north-eastward from Palapshwye to\r\nBulawayo, and from Bulawayo to Fort Salisbury, one passes by degrees\r\nfrom an arid and almost rainless land to a land of showers and flowing\r\nwaters. In Bechuanaland there are, except for three months in the year,\r\nno streams at all. In Matabililand one begins to find perennial brooks.\r\nIn Mashonaland there are at last rivers, sometimes with rocky banks and\r\nclear deep pools, which (like that just mentioned) tempt one to bathe\r\nand risk the terrible snap of a crocodile's jaws. Thus eastern\r\nMashonaland is far more attractive than the countries which I have\r\ndescribed in the last two chapters. It has beautiful and even striking\r\nscenery. The soil, where the granitic rocks do not come too near the\r\nsurface, is usually fertile, and cultivation is easier than in the\r\nregions to the south-west, because the rains are more copious. There are\r\nmany places round Fort Salisbury and on the way thence to Mtali and\r\nMassikessi where a man might willingly settle down to spend his days, so\r\ngenial and so full of beauty is the nature around him. And as the land\r\nis high, it is also healthy. Except in a few of the valley bottoms,\r\nfever need not be feared, even after the rains.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Salisbury to the Indian Ocean at Beira it is a journey of\r\nthree hundred and seventy miles, of which the first one hundred and\r\nfifty-five are in British, the rest in Portuguese, territory. Before the\r\nrailway, which now (1899) runs all the way, had been completed, this\r\ndistance required eight to ten days' travel. It may now be despatched in\r\na day and a half. But those who hurry through this picturesque region\r\nbehind the locomotive lose much of the charm which the journey, by far\r\nthe most attractive part of a South African tour, formerly had for the\r\nlover of nature.\r\n\r\nFor the first forty miles south-eastward from Fort Salisbury the track\r\nruns through a wooded country, diversified by broad stretches of\r\npasture. Here and there we found a European farm, marked in the distance\r\nby the waving tops of the gum-trees, with the low wooden house festooned\r\nby the brilliant mauve blossoms of the climbing bougainvillea, and the\r\ngarden enclosed by hedges of grenadilla, whose fruit is much eaten in\r\nSouth Africa. Vegetables raised on these farms fetch enormous prices in\r\nthe town, so that a man who understands the business may count on making\r\nmore by this than he will do by \"prospecting\" for gold mines, or even by\r\nfloating companies. We found the grass generally fresh and green, for\r\nsome showers had fallen, and the trees, though still small, were in new\r\nleaf with exquisite tints of red. Now and then, through gaps between the\r\nnearer hills, there are glimpses of dim blue mountains. As one gets\r\nfarther to the south-east the hills are higher, and on either side there\r\nrise fantastic kopjes of granite. Their tops are cleft and riven by deep\r\nfissures, and huge detached blocks are strewn about at their base, or\r\nperched like gigantic tables upon the tops of pillars of rock, poised so\r\nfinely that one fancies a blast of wind might overthrow them. These\r\n\"perched blocks,\" however, have not, like the _blocs perchés_ of\r\nWestern Europe, been left by ancient glaciers or icebergs, for it seems\r\nstill doubtful whether there has been a glacial period in South Africa,\r\nand neither here nor in the mountains of Basutoland could I discover\r\ntraces of ancient moraines. They are due to the natural decomposition of\r\nthe rock on the spot. The alternate heat of the day and cold of the\r\nnight--a cold which is often great, owing to the radiation into a\r\ncloudless sky--split the masses by alternate expansion and contraction,\r\nmake great flakes peel off them like the coats of an onion, and give\r\nthem these singularly picturesque shapes. All this part of the country\r\nis as eminently fit for a landscape painter as Bechuanaland and the more\r\nlevel parts of Matabililand are unfit, seeing that here, one has\r\nforegrounds as well as backgrounds, and the colours are as rich as the\r\nforms are varied. For I must add that in this region, instead of the\r\nmonotonous thorny acacias of the western regions, there is much variety\r\nin the trees; no tropical luxuriance,--the air is still too dry for\r\nthat,--but many graceful outlines and a great diversity of foliage.\r\nBesides, the wood has a way of disposing itself with wonderful grace.\r\nThere is none of the monotony either of pine forests, like those of\r\nNorthern and Eastern Europe, or of such forests of deciduous trees as\r\none sees in Michigan and the Alleghanies, but rather what in England we\r\ncall \"park-like scenery,\" though why nature should be supposed to do\r\nbest when she imitates art, I will not attempt to inquire. There are\r\nbelts of wood inclosing secluded lawns, and groups of trees dotted over\r\na stretch of rolling meadow, pretty little bits of detail which enhance\r\nthe charm of the ample sweeps of view that rise and roll to the far-off\r\nblue horizon.\r\n\r\nBeyond Marandella's--the word sounds Italian, but is really the\r\nAnglicized form of the name of a native chief--the country becomes still\r\nmore open, and solitary peaks of gneiss begin to stand up, their sides\r\nof bare, smooth, grey rock sometimes too steep to be climbed. Below and\r\nbetween them are broad stretches of pasture, with here and there, on the\r\nbanks of the streams, pieces of land which seem eminently fit for\r\ntillage. On one such piece--it is called Lawrencedale--we found that two\r\nyoung Englishmen had brought some forty acres into cultivation, and\r\nadmired the crops of vegetables they were raising partly by irrigation,\r\npartly in reliance on the rains. Almost anything will grow, but garden\r\nstuff pays best, because there is in and round Fort Salisbury a market\r\nclamorous for it. The great risk is that of a descent of locusts, for\r\nthese pests may in a few hours strip the ground clean of all that covers\r\nit. However, our young farmers had good hopes of scaring off the swarms,\r\nand if they could do so their profits would be large and certain. A few\r\nhours more through driving showers, which made the weird landscape of\r\nscattered peaks even more solemn, brought us to the halting place on\r\nLezapi River, a pretty spot high above the stream, where the store which\r\nsupplies the neighbourhood with the necessaries of life has blossomed\r\ninto a sort of hotel, with a good many sleeping huts round it. One finds\r\nthese stores at intervals of about twenty or thirty miles; and they,\r\nwith an occasional farm like that of Lawrencedale, represent the\r\nextremely small European population, which averages less than one to a\r\ndozen square miles, even reckoning in the missionaries that are\r\nscattered here and there.\r\n\r\nFrom Lezapi I made an excursion to a curious native building lying some\r\nsix miles to the east, which Mr. Selous had advised me to see. The heat\r\nof the weather made it necessary to start very early, so I was awakened\r\nwhile it was still dark. But when I stood ready to be off just before\r\nsunrise, the Kafir boy, a servant of the store, who was to have guided\r\nme, was not to be found. No search could discover him. He had apparently\r\ndisliked the errand, perhaps had some superstitious fear of the spot he\r\nwas to lead me to, and had vanished, quite unmoved by the prospect of\r\nhis employer's displeasure and of the sum he was to receive. The\r\nincident was characteristic of these natives. They are curiously\r\nwayward. They are influenced by motives they cannot be induced to\r\ndisclose, and the motives which most affect a European sometimes fail\r\naltogether to tell upon them. With great difficulty I succeeded in\r\nfinding another native boy who promised to show me the way, and followed\r\nhim off through the wood and over the pastures, unable to speak a word\r\nto him, and of course, understanding not a word of the voluble bursts of\r\ntalk with which he every now and then favoured me. It was a lovely\r\nmorning, the sky of a soft and creamy blue, dewdrops sparkling on the\r\ntall stalks of grass, the rays of the low sun striking between the\r\ntree-tops in the thick wood that clothed the opposite hill, while here\r\nand there faint blue smoke-wreaths rose from some Kafir hut hidden among\r\nthe brushwood. We passed a large village, and just beyond it overtook\r\nthree Kafirs all talking briskly, as is their wont, one of them carrying\r\na gun and apparently going after game. A good many natives have\r\nfirearms, but acts of violence seem to be extremely rare. Then passing\r\nunder some rocky heights we saw, after an hour and a half's fast\r\nwalking, the group of huts where the Company's native Commissioner, whom\r\nI was going to find, had fixed his station. Some Kafirs were at work on\r\ntheir mealie-plots, and one of them, dropping his mattock, rushed across\r\nand insisted on shaking hands with me, saying \"Moragos,\" which is said\r\nto be a mixture of Dutch and Kafir, meaning \"Good-morning, sir.\" The\r\nCommissioner was living alone among the natives, and declared himself\r\nquite at ease as to their behaviour. One chief dwelling near had been\r\nrestive, but submitted when he was treated with firmness; and the\r\nnatives generally--so he told me--seem rather to welcome the\r\nintervention of a white man to compose their disputes. They are, he\r\nadded, prone to break their promises, except in one case. If an object,\r\neven of small value, has been delivered to them as a token of the\r\nengagement made, they feel bound by the engagement so long as they keep\r\nthis object, and when it is formally demanded back they will restore it\r\nunharmed. The fact is curious, and throws light on some of the features\r\nof primitive legal custom in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner took me to the two pieces of old building--one can\r\nhardly call them ruins--which I had come to see. One (called Chipadzi's)\r\nhas been already mentioned (see p. 75, _ante_). It is a bit of ancient\r\nwall of blocks of trimmed granite, neatly set without mortar, and\r\nevidently meant to defend the most accessible side of a rocky kopje,\r\nwhich in some distant age had been a stronghold. It has all the\r\nappearance of having been constructed by the same race that built the\r\nwalls of Dhlodhlo (see p. 71) and Zimbabwye (see p. 75) (though the work\r\nis not so neat), and is called by the natives a Zimbabwye. Behind it, in\r\nthe centre of the kopje, is a rude low wall of rough stones enclosing\r\nthree huts, only one of which remains roofed. Under this one is the\r\ngrave of a famous chief called Makoni,--the name is rather an official\r\nthan a personal one, and his personal name was Chipadzi,--the uncle of\r\nthe present Makoni, who is the leading chief of this district.[52] On\r\nthe grave there stands a large earthenware pot, which used to be\r\nregularly filled with native beer when, once a year, about the\r\nanniversary of this old Makoni's death, his sons and other descendants\r\ncame to venerate and propitiate his ghost. Some years ago, when the\r\nwhite men came into the country, the ceremony was disused, and the poor\r\nghost is now left without honour and nutriment. The pot is broken, and\r\nanother pot, which stood in an adjoining hut and was used by the\r\nworshippers, has disappeared. The place, however, retains its awesome\r\ncharacter, and a native boy who was with us would not enter it. The\r\nsight brought vividly to my mind the similar spirit-worship which went\r\non among the Romans and which goes on to-day in China; but I could not\r\nascertain for how many generations back an ancestral ghost receives\r\nthese attentions--a point which has remained obscure in the case of\r\nRoman ghosts also.\r\n\r\nThe other curiosity is much more modern. It is a deserted native village\r\ncalled Tchitiketi (\"the walled town\"), which has been rudely fortified\r\nwith three concentric lines of defence, in a way not common among the\r\nKafirs. The huts which have now totally disappeared, stood on one side\r\nof a rocky eminence, and were surrounded by a sort of ditch ten feet\r\ndeep, within which was a row of trees planted closely together, with the\r\nintervals probably originally filled by a stockade. Some of these trees\r\ndo not grow wild in this part of the country, and have apparently been\r\nplanted from shoots brought from the Portuguese territories. Within this\r\noutmost line there was a second row of trees and a rough stone wall,\r\nforming an inner defence. Still farther in one finds a kind of citadel,\r\nformed partly by the rocks of the kopje, partly by a wall of rough\r\nstones, ten feet high and seven to eight feet thick, plastered with mud,\r\nwhich holds the stones together like mortar. This wall is pierced by\r\nsmall apertures, which apparently served as loopholes for arrows, and\r\nthere is a sort of narrow gate through it, only four and a half feet\r\nhigh, covered by a slab of stone. Within the citadel, several chiefs are\r\nburied in crevices of the rock, which have been walled up, and there are\r\nstill visible the remains of the huts wherein, upon a wicker stand, were\r\nplaced the pots that held the beer provided for their ghosts. Having\r\nceased to be a royal residence or a fortress, the spot remains, like the\r\nEscurial, a place of royal sepulture. The natives remember the names of\r\nthe dead chiefs, but little else, and cannot tell one when the fortress\r\nwas built nor why it was forsaken. Everything is so rude that one must\r\nsuppose the use of loopholes to have been learned from the Portuguese,\r\nwho apparently came from time to time into these regions; and the\r\nrudeness confirms the theory that the buildings at the Great Zimbabwye\r\nwere not the work of any of the present Bantu tribes, but of some less\r\nbarbarous race.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to find one's way alone over the country in these parts,\r\nwhere no Kafir speaks English or even Dutch, and where the network of\r\nnative foot-paths crossing one another soon confuses recollection.\r\nHowever, having a distant mountain-peak to steer my course by, I\r\nsucceeded in making my way back alone, and was pleased to find that,\r\nthough the sun was now high in heaven and I had neither a sun-helmet nor\r\na white umbrella, its rays did me no harm. A stranger, however, can take\r\nliberties with the sun which residents hold it safer not to take.\r\nEuropeans in these countries walk as little as they can, especially in\r\nthe heat of the day. They would ride, were horses attainable, but the\r\nhorse-sickness makes it extremely difficult to find or to retain a good\r\nanimal. All travelling for any distance is of course done in a waggon or\r\n(where one can be had) in a Cape cart.\r\n\r\nFrom the Lezapi River onward the scenery grows more striking as one\r\npasses immediately beneath some of the tall towers of rock which we had\r\npreviously admired from a distance. They remind one, in their generally\r\ngrey hue and the extreme boldness of their lines, of some of the\r\ngneissose pinnacles of Norway, such as those above Naerodal, on the\r\nSogne Fiord. One of them, to which the English have given the name of\r\nthe Sugar Loaf, soars in a face of smooth sheer rock nearly 1000 feet\r\nabove the track, the lichens that cover it showing a wealth of rich\r\ncolours, greens and yellows, varied here and there by long streaks of\r\nblack raindrip. Behind this summit to the north-east, eight to twelve\r\nmiles away, rose a long range of sharp, jagged peaks, perfectly bare,\r\nand showing by their fine-cut lines the hardness of their rock. They\r\nwere not lofty, at most 2000 feet above the level of the plateau, which\r\nis here from 4000 to 5000 feet above sea-level. But the nobility of\r\ntheir forms, and their clear parched sternness as they stood in the\r\nintense sunshine, made them fill and satisfy the eye beyond what one\r\nwould have expected from their height. That severe and even forbidding\r\nquality which is perceptible in the aspect of the South African\r\nmountains, as it is in those of some other hot countries, seems to be\r\ndue to the sense of their aridity and bareness. One feels no longing to\r\nclimb them, as one would long to climb a picturesque mountain in Europe,\r\nbecause one knows that upon their scorching sides there is no verdure\r\nand no fountain breaks from beneath their crags. Beautiful as they are,\r\nthey are repellent; they invite no familiarity; they speak of the\r\nhardness, the grimness, the silent aloofness of nature. It is only when\r\nthey form the distant background of a view, and especially when the\r\nwaning light of evening clothes their stern forms with tender hues, that\r\nthey become elements of pure delight in the landscape.\r\n\r\nSome fifteen miles east of this range we came upon a natural object we\r\nhad given up hoping to see in South Africa, a country where the element\r\nnecessary to it is so markedly deficient. This was the waterfall on the\r\nOudzi River, one of the tributaries of the great Sabi River, which falls\r\ninto the Indian Ocean. The Oudzi is not very large in the dry season,\r\nnor so full as the Garry at Killiecrankie or the stream which flows\r\nthrough the Yosemite Valley. But even this represents a considerable\r\nvolume of water for tropical East Africa; and the rapid--it is really\r\nrather a rapid than a cascade--must be a grand sight after heavy rain,\r\nas it is a picturesque sight even in October. The stream rushes over a\r\nridge of very hard granite rock, intersected by veins of finer-grained\r\ngranite and of greenstone. It has cut for itself several deep channels\r\nin the rock, and has scooped out many hollows, not, as usually,\r\ncircular, but elliptical in their shape, polished smooth, like the\r\nlittle pockets or basins which loose stones polish smooth as they are\r\ndriven round and round by the current in the rocky bed of a Scotch\r\ntorrent. The brightness of the clear green water and the softness of the\r\nsurrounding woods, clothing each side of the long valley down which the\r\neye pursues the stream till the vista is closed by distant mountains,\r\nmake these falls one of the most novel and charming bits of scenery even\r\nin this romantic land. Another pleasant surprise was in store for us\r\nbefore we reached Mtali. We had descried from some way off a mass of\r\nbrilliant crimson on a steep hillside. Coming close under, we saw it to\r\nbe a wood whose trees were covered with fresh leaves. The locusts had\r\neaten off all the first leaves three weeks before, and this was the\r\nsecond crop. Such a wealth of intense yet delicate reds of all hues,\r\npink, crimson, and scarlet, sometimes passing into a flushed green,\r\nsometimes into an umber brown, I have never seen, not even in the autumn\r\nwoods of North America, where, as on the mountain that overhangs\r\nMontreal, the forest is aflame with the glow of the maples. The spring,\r\nif one may give that name to the season of the first summer rains, is\r\nfor South Africa the time of colours, as is the autumn in our temperate\r\nclimes.\r\n\r\nMtali--it is often written \"Umtali\" to express that vague half-vowel\r\nwhich comes at the beginning of so many words in the Bantu languages--is\r\na pretty little settlement in a valley whose sheltered position would\r\nmake it oppressive but for the strong easterly breeze which blows nearly\r\nevery day during the hot weather. There is plenty of good water in the\r\nhills all round, and the higher slopes are green with fresh grass. The\r\ntown, like other towns in these regions, is constructed of corrugated\r\niron,--for wood is scarce and dear,--with a few brick-walled houses and\r\na fringe of native huts, while the outskirts are deformed by a thick\r\ndeposit of empty tins of preserved meat and petroleum. All the roofs are\r\nof iron, and a prudent builder puts iron also into the foundation of the\r\nwalls beneath the brick, in order to circumvent the white ants. These\r\ninsects are one of the four plagues of South Central Africa. (The other\r\nthree are locusts, horse-sickness, and fever; some add a fifth--the\r\nspeculators in mining shares.) They destroy every scrap of organic\r\nmatter they can reach, and will even eat their way through brick to\r\nreach wood or any other vegetable matter. Nothing but metal stops them.\r\nThey work in the dark, constructing a kind of tunnel or gallery if they\r\nhave to pass along an open space, as, for instance, to reach books upon\r\na shelf. (I was taken to see the public library at Mtali, and found they\r\nhad destroyed nearly half of it.) They are less than half an inch long,\r\nof a dull greyish white, the queen, or female, about three times as\r\nlarge as the others. Her quarters are in a sort of nest deep in the\r\nground, and if this nest can be found and destroyed, the plague will be\r\nstayed, for a time at least. There are several other kinds of ants. The\r\nsmall red ant gets among one's provisions and devours the cold chicken.\r\nWe spent weary hours in trying to get them out of our food-boxes, being\r\nunable to fall in with the local view that they ought to be eaten with\r\nthe meat they swarm over, as a sort of relish to it. There is also the\r\nlarge reddish-black ant, which bites fiercely, but is regarded with\r\nfavour because it kills the white ants when it can get at them. But the\r\nwhite ant is by far the most pernicious kind, and a real curse to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1896, when the construction of the Beira railway from\r\nChimoyo to Fort Salisbury began to be energetically prosecuted, it was\r\nfound that to take the line past Mtali would involve a detour of some\r\nmiles and a heavy gradient in crossing a ridge at the Christmas Pass.\r\nMr. Rhodes promptly determined, instead of bringing the railway to the\r\ntown, to bring the town to the railway. Liberal compensation was\r\naccordingly paid to all those who had built houses at old Mtali, and new\r\nMtali was in 1897 founded on a carefully selected site seven miles away.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 there were about one hundred Europeans in the town of Mtali,\r\nall, except the Company's officials and the storekeepers, engaged in\r\nprospecting for or beginning to work gold-mines; for this is the centre\r\nof one of the first-explored gold districts, and sanguine hopes have\r\nbeen entertained of its reefs. We drove out to see some of the most\r\npromising in the Penha Longa Valley, six miles to the eastward. Here\r\nthree sets of galleries have been cut, and the extraction of the metal\r\nwas said to be ready to begin if the machinery could be brought up from\r\nthe coast. As to the value and prospects of the reefs, over which I was\r\nmost courteously shown by the gentlemen directing the operations, I\r\ncould of course form no opinion. They are quartz-reefs, occurring in\r\ntalcose and chloritic schistose rocks, and some of them maintain their\r\ndirection for many miles. There is no better place than this valley[53]\r\nfor examining the ancient gold-workings, for here they are of great\r\nsize. Huge masses of alluvial soil in the bottom of the valley had\r\nevidently been turned over, and indeed a few labourers were still at\r\nwork upon these. But there had also been extensive open cuttings all\r\nalong the principal reefs, the traces of which are visible in the deep\r\ntrenches following the line of the reefs up and down the slopes of the\r\nhills, and in the masses of rubbish thrown out beside them. Some of\r\nthese cuttings are evidently recent, for the sides are in places steep\r\nand even abrupt, which they would not be if during many years the rains\r\nhad been washing the earth down into the trenches. Moreover, iron\r\nimplements have been found at the bottom, of modern shapes and very\r\nlittle oxidized. Probably, therefore, while some of these workings may\r\nbe of great antiquity, others are quite recent--perhaps less than a\r\ncentury old. Such workings occur in many places over Mashonaland and\r\nMatabililand. They are always open; that is to say, the reef was worked\r\ndown from the surface, not along a tunnel--a fact which has made people\r\nthink that they were carried on by natives only; and they almost always\r\nstop when water is reached, as though the miners had known nothing of\r\npumps. Tradition has nothing to say as to the workings; but we know that\r\nduring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a good deal of gold was\r\nbrought down to the Portuguese coast stations; and when the Mashonaland\r\npioneers came in 1890, there were a few Portuguese trying to get the\r\nmetal out of the alluvial deposits along the stream banks. The reefs,\r\nwhich are now being followed by level shafts or galleries driven into\r\nthe sides of the hills, are (in most cases at least) the same as those\r\nwhich the old miners attacked from above.\r\n\r\nNorth of Penha Longa lies an attractive bit of country, near a place\r\ncalled Inyanga, which, unfortunately, we had not time to visit. It is a\r\nsort of tableland about thirty miles long by fifteen wide, from 6000 to\r\n7000 feet above sea-level, with the highest summits reaching 8000 feet;\r\nand in respect of its height enjoys not only a keen and bracing air, but\r\na copious rainfall, which makes it a specially good grazing country. It\r\nwill probably one day become not only the choicest ranching-ground of\r\nEast Central Africa, but also a health resort from the surrounding\r\nregions. At present it is quite empty, the land having been, as I was\r\ntold, bought up by several syndicates, who are holding it in hope of a\r\nrise in prices. Here are the remarkable stone-cased pits, referred to in\r\nChapter IX.; and here there are also numerous ancient artificial\r\nwatercourses for irrigating the soil, which were constructed by some\r\nrace of immigrants accustomed to artificial irrigation in their own\r\ncountry, for it would hardly have occurred to natives to construct such\r\nworks here, where the rainfall is sufficient for the needs of tillage.\r\nStill farther to the north is a less elevated region, remarkable for the\r\ntraces it bears of having been at one time densely populated. Tillage\r\nwas so extensive that the very hillsides were built up into terraces to\r\nbe planted with crops. To-day there are hardly any inhabitants, for a\r\ngood many years ago Mzila, the father of Gungunhana, chief of a fierce\r\nand powerful tribe which lives on the lower course of the Sabi River,\r\nraided all this country, and in successive invasions killed off or\r\nchased away the whole population. Such wholesale slaughter and\r\ndevastation is no uncommon thing in the annals of South Africa. Tshaka,\r\nthe uncle of Cetewayo, annihilated the inhabitants over immense tracts\r\nround Zululand. And in comparison with such bloodthirsty methods the\r\nAssyrian plan of deporting conquered populations from their homes to\r\nsome distant land may have seemed, and indeed may have been, a\r\nsubstantial step in human progress. However, just when Tshaka was\r\nmassacring his Kafir neighbours, the Turks were massacring the\r\nChristians of Chios, and at the time of our visit, in October, 1895,\r\nAbdul-Hamid II. was beginning his massacres in Asia Minor; so perhaps\r\nthe less said about progress the better.\r\n\r\nThe track from Mtali to the sea crosses a high ridge at a point called\r\nthe Christmas Pass, and descends into Portuguese territory through some\r\nvery noble and varied mountain scenery.[54] It reminded us sometimes of\r\nthe Italian slopes of the Eastern Alps, sometimes of the best parts of\r\nthe Perthshire Highlands, though of course it was rather in the forms of\r\nhill and valley than in the trees that clothed their slopes that this\r\nresemblance lay. The first Portuguese settlement is at a place called\r\nMacequece, or Massikessi, where the pioneers of the British South Africa\r\nCompany conducted in 1891 a little war on their own account with the\r\nPortuguese, whose superior forces they routed. The Portuguese claimed\r\nall this inland region on the Hinterland principle, in respect of their\r\nownership of the coast, while the British pioneers relied on the fact\r\nthat their adversaries had never established a really effective\r\noccupation. The dispute was carried by the Portuguese Mozambique Company\r\ninto the English courts of law,[55] and was ultimately adjusted\r\ndiplomatically by an agreement between the British and Portuguese\r\ngovernments, signed June 11, 1891. The delimitation of the frontiers was\r\nnot fully completed in this region till 1896, but Massikessi was by the\r\ntreaty of 1891 left to Portugal. After Massikessi the mountains recede,\r\nand wide plains begin to open to the east and south. As the country\r\nsinks, the temperature rises and the air grows heavier and less keen.\r\nThe ground is covered with wood, and in the woods along the streams a\r\nfew palms and bamboos and other tropical forms of vegetation begin to\r\nappear.[56] But we found the woods in many places stripped bare.\r\nTerrible swarms of locusts had passed, leaving a track of dismal\r\nbareness. It had been a dry year, too, and even what grass the locusts\r\nhad spared was thin and withered. Thus for want of food the cattle had\r\nperished. All along the road from Mtali we saw oxen lying dead, often by\r\nsome pool in a brook, to which they had staggered to drink, and where\r\nthey lay down to die. We encountered few waggons, and those few were\r\nalmost all standing with the team unyoked, some of their beasts dead or\r\nsickly, some, too weak to draw the load farther, obliged to stand idly\r\nwhere they had halted till the animals should regain strength, or fresh\r\noxen be procured. This is what a visitation of locusts means, and this\r\nis how the progress of a country is retarded by the stoppage of the only\r\nmeans of transport.\r\n\r\nWe reached the terminus of the railway at Chimoyo after two days' long\r\nand fatiguing travel from Mtali, including an upset of our vehicle in\r\ndescending a steep donga to the bed of a streamlet--an upset which might\r\neasily have proved serious, but gave us nothing worse than a few\r\nbruises. The custom being to start a train in the afternoon and run it\r\nthrough the night,--all trains were then special,--we had plenty of time\r\nto look round the place, and fortunately found a comfortable store and a\r\nmost genial Scottish landlord from Banffshire. There was, however,\r\nnothing to see, not even Portuguese local colour; for though Chimoyo is\r\nwell within the Portuguese frontier, the village is purely English, and\r\nwas living by the transport service which then made the end of the\r\nrailway its starting-point for the territories of the Company. Now that\r\nit has become merely a station, the railway being now (1899) open all\r\nthe way to Fort Salisbury, it may have dwindled away. Having nothing\r\nelse to do, I climbed through the sultry noon to the top of the nearest\r\nkopje, a steep granite hill which, as I was afterwards told, is a\r\nfavourite \"house of call\" for lions. No forest monarch, however,\r\npresented himself to welcome me, and I was left to enjoy the view alone.\r\nIt was striking. Guarding the western horizon rose the long chain of\r\nmountains from which we had emerged stretching in a huge arc from\r\nsouth-east to north, with some bold outlying peaks flung forward from\r\nthe main mass, all by their sharp, stern outlines, in which similar\r\nforms were constantly repeated, showing that they were built of the same\r\nhard crystalline rocks. Beneath, the country spread out in a vast,\r\nwooded plain, green or brown, according as the wood was denser in one\r\npart and sparser in another. It was still low wood, with no sense of\r\ntropical luxuriance about it, and the ground still dry, with not a\r\nglimpse of water anywhere. Here and there out of this sea of forest rose\r\nisolated heights whose abrupt craggy tops glistened in the sunlight. To\r\nthe east the plain fell slowly away to an immensely distant horizon,\r\nwhere lay the deadly flats that border the Indian Ocean. Except where\r\nthe iron roofs of the huts at Chimoyo shone, there was not a sign of\r\nhuman dwelling or human labour through this great wild country, lying\r\nstill and monotonous under a cloudless sky. It has been a wilderness\r\nfrom the beginning of the world until now, traversed, no doubt, many\r\ncenturies ago by the gold-seekers whose favourite track went up from the\r\ncoast past Great Zimbabwye into what is now Matabililand, traversed\r\nagain occasionally in later times by Portuguese traders, but in no wise\r\naltered during these thousands of years from its original aspect. Now at\r\nlast its turn has come. A new race of gold-seekers have built a railway,\r\nand along the railway, wherever there are not swamps to breed fever, the\r\nland will be taken for farms, and the woods will be cut down, and the\r\nwild beasts will slink away, and trading-posts will grow into villages,\r\nand the journey from Beira to Bulawayo will become as easy and familiar\r\nas is to-day the journey from Chicago to San Francisco, through a\r\ncountry which a century ago was as little known as this African\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nThe railway from Chimoyo to the sea had in 1895 one of the narrowest\r\ngauges in the world (two feet), and its tiny locomotives and cars wore\r\nalmost a toy air. It has since been widened to the three feet six gauge\r\nof the other South African lines. The construction was difficult, for\r\nthe swampy lands along the coast are largely under water during the\r\nrains, but the gain to the country has been enormous. Not only has the\r\nrailway abridged the toilsome and costly ox transport of goods from\r\nBeira to the edge of the high country--a transport whose difficulty lay\r\nnot merely in the badness of the track through ground almost impassable\r\nduring and after the rains, but also in the prevalence of the\r\ntsetse-fly, whose bite is fatal to cattle. It has enabled travellers to\r\ncross in a few hours one of the most unhealthy regions in the world,\r\nmost of which is infested by fevers in and after the wet season, and the\r\nlower parts of which are so malarious that few who spend three nights in\r\nthem, even in the dry season, escape an attack. The banks of the rivers\r\nand other damper spots will continue to breed this curse of maritime\r\nAfrica, although things will doubtless improve when the country grows\r\nmore settled, and the marshes have been drained, and the long grass has\r\nbeen eaten down by cattle; for when the tsetse-fly has ceased to be\r\ndangerous cattle may come in. It appears that the fly kills cattle not\r\nby anything poisonous in its bite, but because it communicates to them a\r\nminute parasite which lives in the blood of some kinds of game, and\r\nwhich is more pernicious to cattle than it is to the game. Accordingly,\r\nwhen the game vanishes, the fly either vanishes also or becomes\r\ncomparatively harmless. Already places once infested by it have by the\r\ndisappearance of the game become available for ranching. Recent\r\nresearches seem to have shown that malarial fevers in man are also due\r\nto an animal parasite: and this discovery is thought to damp the hope,\r\nwhich I remember to have heard Mr. Darwin express, that the\r\nfever-stricken regions of the tropics might become safe by ascertaining\r\nwhat the fever microbe is and securing men against it by inoculation.\r\nThose, however, who hold that this parasite is carried into the blood of\r\nman by a mosquito seem to entertain some hope that drainage may in some\r\nplaces almost expunge the mosquito. The railway was made entirely by\r\nnative labour gathered from the surrounding regions, and the contractors\r\ntold me they had less difficulty with the Kafirs than they expected. It\r\npaid, however, a heavy toll in European life. Not one of the engineers\r\nand foremen escaped fever, and many died. The risk for those employed on\r\nthe line is of course now much slighter, because the worst spots are\r\nknown and there are now houses to sleep in.\r\n\r\nShortly after leaving Chimoyo the train ran through a swarm of locusts\r\nmiles long. It was a beautiful sight. The creatures flash like red\r\nsnowflakes in the sun; the air glitters with their gauzy wings. But it\r\nis also terrible. An earthquake or a volcanic eruption is hardly more\r\ndestructive and hardly more irresistible. The swarms may be combated\r\nwhen the insect walks along the ground, for then trenches may be dug\r\ninto which the advancing host falls. But when it flies nothing can stop\r\nit. It is noteworthy that for eighteen years prior to the arrival of the\r\nBritish pioneers in 1890 there had been no great swarms. Since that year\r\nthere have been several; so the Kafir thinks that it is the white man's\r\ncoming that has provoked the powers of evil to send this plague as well\r\nas the murrain.\r\n\r\nWe ran down the one hundred and eighteen miles from Chimoyo to\r\nFontesvilla during the afternoon and night, halting for three or four\r\nhours for dinner at a clearing where an inn and store have been built.\r\nThe pace was from ten to fifteen miles an hour. After the first twenty\r\nmiles, during which one still has glimpses of the strange isolated peaks\r\nthat spring up here and there from the plain, the scenery becomes rather\r\nmonotonous, for the line runs most of the way through thick forest, the\r\ntrees higher than those of the interior, yet not of any remarkable\r\nbeauty. For the last twenty-five miles the railway traverses a dead and\r\ndreary flat. The gentle rise of the ground to the west conceals even the\r\noutlying spurs of the great range behind, and to the north and south\r\nthere is an unbroken level. The soil is said to be generally poor, a\r\nvery thin layer of vegetable mould lying over sand, and the trees are\r\nfew and seldom tall. It is a country full of all sorts of game, from\r\nbuffaloes, elands, and koodoos downward to the small antelopes; and as\r\ngame abounds, so also do lions abound. The early morning is the time\r\nwhen most of these creatures go out to feed, and we strained our eyes as\r\nsoon as there was light enough to make them out from the car windows.\r\nBut beyond some wild pig and hartebeest, and a few of the smaller\r\nantelopes, nothing could be discerned upon the pastures or among the\r\ntree clumps. Perhaps the creatures have begun to learn that the railroad\r\nbrings their enemies, and keep far away from it. A year after our visit\r\nthe murrain, to which I have already referred, appeared in this region,\r\nand wrought fearful devastation among the wild animals, especially the\r\nbuffaloes.\r\n\r\nThe railway now runs all the way to the port of Beira, but in October,\r\n1895, came to an end at a place called Fontesvilla, on the Pungwe River,\r\nnear the highest point to which the tide rises. We had therefore to take\r\nto the water in order to reach Beira, where a German steamer was timed\r\nto call two days later; and our friends in Mashonaland had prepared us\r\nto expect some disagreeable experiences on the river, warning us not to\r\nassume that twelve or fourteen hours would be enough, even in a steamer,\r\nto accomplish the fifty miles of navigation that lie between Fontesvilla\r\nand the sea. They had been specially insistent that we should remain in\r\nFontesvilla itself no longer than was absolutely necessary; for\r\nFontesvilla has the reputation of being the most unhealthy spot in all\r\nthis unhealthy country. We were told that the preceding year had been a\r\nsalubrious one, for only forty-two per cent. of the European residents\r\nhad died. There may have been in these figures, when closely\r\nscrutinized, some element of exaggeration, but the truth they were\r\nintended to convey is beyond dispute; and the bright young assistant\r\nsuperintendent of the railroad was mentioned, with evident wonder, as\r\nthe only person who had been more than three months in the place without\r\na bad attack of fever. Fontesvilla has not the externals of a\r\ncharnel-house. It consists of seven or eight scattered frame houses,\r\nwith roofs of corrugated iron, set in a dull, featureless flat on the\r\nbanks of a muddy river. The air is sultry and depressing, but has not\r\nthat foul swamp smell with which Poti, on the Black Sea, reeks, the most\r\nmalarious spot I had ever before visited. Nor was there much stagnant\r\nwater visible; indeed, the ground seemed dry, though there are marshes\r\nhidden among the woods on the other side of the river. As neither of the\r\nsteamers that ply on the Pungwe could come up at neap tides, and with\r\nthe stream low,--for the rains had not yet set in,--the young\r\nsuperintendent (to whose friendly help we were much beholden) had\r\nbespoken a rowboat to come up for us from the lower part of the river.\r\nAfter waiting from eight till half-past ten o'clock for this boat, we\r\nbegan to fear it had failed us, and, hastily engaging a small two-oared\r\none that lay by the bank, set off in it down the stream. Fortunately\r\nafter two and a half miles the other boat, a heavy old tub, was seen\r\nslowly making her way upward, having on board the captain of the little\r\nsteam-launch, the launch herself being obliged to remain much lower down\r\nthe river. We transferred ourselves and our effects to this boat, and\r\nfloated gaily down, thinking our troubles over.\r\n\r\nThe Pungwe is here about one hundred yards wide, but very shallow, and\r\nwith its water so turbid that we could not see the bottom where the\r\ndepth exceeded two feet. It was noon; the breeze had dropped, and the\r\nsun was so strong that we gladly took refuge in the little cabin or\r\nrather covered box--a sort of hen coop--at the stern. The stream and the\r\ntide were with us, and we had four native rowers, but our craft was so\r\nheavy that we accomplished less than two miles an hour. As the channel\r\ngrew wider and the current spread itself hither and thither over sand\r\nbanks, the bed became more shallow, and from time to time we grounded.\r\nWhen this happened, the native rowers jumped into the water and pushed\r\nor pulled the boat along. The farther down we went, and the more the\r\nriver widened, so much the more often did we take the bottom, and the\r\nharder did we find it to get afloat again. Twelve miles below\r\nFontesvilla, a river called the Bigimiti comes in on the right, and at\r\nits mouth we took on board a bold young English sportsman with the skin\r\nof a huge lion. Below the confluence, where a maze of sand banks\r\nencumbers the channel, we encountered a strong easterly breeze. The big\r\nclumsy boat made scarcely any way against it, and stuck upon the sand so\r\noften that the Kafirs, who certainly worked with a will, were more than\r\nhalf the time in the water up to their knees, tugging and shoving to get\r\nher off. Meanwhile the tide, what there was of it, was ebbing fast, and\r\nthe captain admitted that if we did not get across these shoals within\r\nhalf an hour we should certainly lie fast upon them till next morning at\r\nleast, and how much longer no one could tell. It was not a pleasant\r\nprospect, for we had no food except some biscuits and a tin of cocoa,\r\nand a night on the Pungwe, with pestiferous swamps all round, meant\r\nalmost certainly an attack of fever. Nothing, however, could be done\r\nbeyond what the captain and the Kafirs were doing, so that suspense was\r\nweighted by no sense of personal responsibility. We moved alternately\r\nfrom stern to bow, and back from bow to stern, to lighten the boat at\r\none end or the other, and looked to windward to see from the sharp curl\r\nof the waves whether the gusts which stopped our progress were\r\nfreshening further. Fortunately they abated. Just as the captain seemed\r\nto be giving up hope--the only fault we had with him was that his face\r\nrevealed too plainly his anxieties--we felt ourselves glide off into a\r\ndeeper channel; the Kafirs jumped in and smote the dark-brown current\r\nwith their oars, and the prospect of a restful night at Beira rose once\r\nmore before us. But our difficulties were not quite over, for we\r\ngrounded several times afterwards, and progress was so slow that it\r\nseemed very doubtful whether we should find and reach before dark the\r\nlittle steam-launch that had come up to meet us.\r\n\r\nEver since my childish imagination had been captivated by the picture of\r\nAfrica's sunny fountains rolling down their golden sand, the idea of\r\ntraversing a tropical forest on the bosom of a great African river had\r\nretained its fascination. Here at last was the reality, and what a\r\ndreary reality! The shallow, muddy stream, broken into many channels,\r\nwhich inclosed low, sandy islets, had spread to a width of two miles.\r\nThe alluvial banks, rising twenty feet in alternate layers of sand and\r\nclay, cut off any view of the country behind. All that could be seen was\r\na fringe of thick, low trees, the edge of the forest that ran back from\r\nthe river. Conspicuous among them was the ill-omened \"fever tree,\" with\r\nits gaunt, bare, ungainly arms and yellow bark--the tree whose presence\r\nindicates a pestilential air. Here was no luxuriant variety of form, no\r\nwealth of colour, no festooned creepers nor brilliant flowers, but a\r\ndull and sad monotony, as we doubled point after point and saw reach\r\nafter reach of the featureless stream spread out before us. Among the\r\ntrees not a bird was to be seen or heard; few even fluttered on the\r\nbosom of the river. We watched for crocodiles sunning themselves on the\r\nsandspits, and once or twice thought we saw them some two hundred yards\r\naway, but they had always disappeared as we drew nearer. The beast is\r\nquick to take alarm at the slightest noise, and not only the paddles of\r\na steamer, but even the plash of oars, will drive him into the water.\r\nFor his coyness we were partly consoled by the gambols of the\r\nriver-horses. All round the boat these creatures were popping up their\r\nhuge snouts and shoulders, splashing about, and then plunging again into\r\nthe swirling water. Fortunately none rose quite close to us, for the\r\nhippopotamus, even if he means no mischief, may easily upset a boat when\r\nhe comes up under it, or may be induced by curiosity to submerge it with\r\none bite of his strong jaws, in which case the passengers are likely to\r\nhave fuller opportunities than they desire of becoming acquainted with\r\nthe crocodiles.\r\n\r\nAmong such sights the sultry afternoon wore itself slowly into night,\r\nand just as dark fell--it falls like a stage curtain in these\r\nlatitudes--we joyfully descried the steam-launch waiting for us behind a\r\nsandy point. Once embarked upon her, we made better speed through the\r\nnight. It was cloudy, with a struggling moon, which just showed us a\r\nlabyrinth of flat, densely wooded isles, their margins fringed with\r\nmangrove trees. Exhausted by a journey of more than thirty hours without\r\nsleep, we were now so drowsy as to be in constant danger of falling off\r\nthe tiny launch, which had neither seats nor bulwarks, and even the\r\ncaptain's strong tea failed to rouse us. Everything seemed like a\r\ndream--this lonely African river, with the faint moonlight glimmering\r\nhere and there upon its dark bosom, while the tree tops upon untrodden\r\nislets flitted past in a slow, funereal procession, befitting a land of\r\nsilence and death.\r\n\r\nAt last, when it was now well past midnight, a few lights were seen in\r\nthe distance, and presently we were at Beira. As we touched the shore we\r\nwere told that the German steamer had already arrived, two days before\r\nher time, and was to start in the morning at ten o'clock. So we made\r\nstraight for her, and next day at noon sailed for Delagoa Bay.\r\n\r\nBeira stands on a sand-spit between the ocean and the estuary of the\r\nPungwe River. Though the swamps come close up to it, the town itself is\r\ntolerably healthy at all seasons, because the strong easterly breeze\r\nblows from the sea three days out of four. Before 1890 there was hardly\r\neven a house, and its quick growth is entirely due to its having been\r\ndiscovered to possess the best harbour on the coast, and to be therefore\r\nthe fittest point of departure from the sea for the territories of the\r\nBritish South African Company.\r\n\r\nIn old days the chief Portuguese settlement on this part of the coast\r\nwas at Sofala, a few miles farther to the south, which had been visited\r\nby Vasco da Gama in A.D. 1502, and where the Portuguese built a fort in\r\n1505. It was then an Arab town, and famous as the place whence most of\r\nthe gold brought down from the interior was exported. Now it has shrunk\r\nto insignificance, and Beira will probably become the most important\r\nhaven on the coast between Delagoa Bay, to the south, and Dar-es-Salaam,\r\nthe head-quarters of German administration, to the north. It may,\r\nhowever, be rivalled by Pemba Bay north of the Zambesi, from which it is\r\nproposed to run a railway to the south end of Lake Nyassa. The anchorage\r\nin the estuary behind the sand-spit is spacious and sheltered, and the\r\noutrush of the tide from the large estuary keeps down, by its constant\r\nscour, accumulations of sand upon the bar. The rise of tide at this part\r\nof the coast, from which Madagascar is only four hundred miles distant,\r\nis twenty-two feet, and the channel of approach, though narrow and\r\nwinding (for the coast is shallow and there are shoals for six or eight\r\nmiles out), is tolerably well buoyed and not really difficult. The\r\nrailway terminus is placed at a point within the harbour where the\r\nsand-spit joins the mainland.\r\n\r\nThe journey which I have described, with all its difficulties, first on\r\nthe river between Beira and Fontesvilla, and then again on the track\r\nbetween Chimoyo and Mtali, has since my visit become a thing of the\r\npast. Early in 1896 the railway was opened from Fontesvilla to Beira, so\r\nthat the tedious and vexatiously uncertain voyage up or down the Pungwe\r\nRiver is now superseded by a more swift if less exciting form of travel.\r\nAnd the permanent way was rapidly laid from Chimoyo northward, so that\r\ntrains were running all the way from the sea to Fort Salisbury by the\r\nmiddle of 1899. Should the resources of Mashonaland turn out within the\r\nnext few years to be what its more sanguine inhabitants assert, its\r\nprogress will be enormously accelerated by this line, which will give a\r\nfar shorter access to South Central Africa than can be had by the rival\r\nlines that start from Cape Town, from Durban, and from Delagoa Bay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: This chief was the restive chief mentioned on the last\r\npreceding page. He joined in the rising of 1896, and was, I believe,\r\ntaken prisoner and shot.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: It was here only, on the banks of a stream, that I\r\nobserved the extremely handsome arboraceous St.-John's-wort (_Hypericum\r\nSchimperi_), mentioned in Chapter IV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: It is in the midst of this scenery that new Mtali has been\r\nbuilt.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _Law Reports_ for 1893, A.

Now, while\r\nthe German steamer is threading her way to the open ocean through the\r\nshoals that surround the entrance to the harbour of Beira, the traveller\r\nas he gazes on the receding shore tries to sum up his impressions\r\nregarding the economic prospects as well of Mashonaland as of the other\r\nterritories of the British South Africa Company. I will shortly state\r\nthese impressions.\r\n\r\nThe regions over which the British flag flies between the Transvaal\r\nRepublic to the south and the territories of Germany and of the Congo\r\nState to the north, fall into three parts. The first is the country\r\nnorth of the Zambesi. The easternmost section of this northerly region\r\nis Nyassaland, of which I need say nothing, because it has been\r\nadmirably described by the distinguished officer (Sir H. H. Johnston)\r\nwho administered it for some years. The central and western sections,\r\nwhich are under the control of the Company, are still too little known\r\nfor an estimate of their value to be formed. Though some parts are more\r\nthan 4000 feet above sea-level, most of the country lies below that\r\nline, which is, roughly speaking, the line at which malarial fevers\r\ncease to be formidable. Most of it, therefore, is not likely to be fit\r\nfor European colonization, and the heat is of course such as to put\r\nEuropean labour out of the question. Considerable tracts are, however,\r\nbelieved to be fertile, and other tracts good for pasture, while there\r\nis some evidence of the existence of gold and other minerals. The least\r\nvaluable region is believed to be that north of the Middle Zambesi,\r\nwhere there are some dry and almost barren districts. Taking it all in\r\nall, it is a country well worth having; but its resources will have to\r\nbe turned to account entirely through black labour; and as it is not\r\nlikely to attract any Europeans, except gold-prospectors, until the\r\nunoccupied lands south of the Zambesi have been fully taken up, its\r\ndevelopment belongs to a comparatively distant future.\r\n\r\nThe second region--that which lies south of the Upper Zambesi,\r\nnorth-west of Matabililand--is equally little known, and, so far as\r\nknown, is not attractive. Most of it is comparatively low; much of it is\r\narid; some parts, especially those round Lake Ngami, are marshy and\r\ntherefore malarious. It is thinly peopled, has not been ascertained to\r\npossess any mineral wealth, and lies far from any possible market. Parts\r\nof it may turn out to afford good pasture, but for the present little is\r\nsaid or thought about it, and no efforts have been made to develop it.\r\n\r\nThe third region comprises Matabililand and Mashonaland, that is, the\r\ncountry between the Transvaal Republic and the valley of the Middle\r\nZambesi, all of which is now administered by the Company. What there is\r\nto say about its prospects may be summed up under three heads--health,\r\nwealth, and peace. It is on these three things that its future welfare\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\n_Health._--A large part of the country, estimated at nearly 100,000\r\nsquare miles, belongs to the Upper South African plateau, and has an\r\nelevation of at least 3000 feet above the sea; and of this area about\r\n26,000 square miles have an elevation of 4000 feet or upward. This\r\nheight, coupled with fresh easterly breezes and dry weather during eight\r\nmonths in the year, gives the country a salubrious and even bracing\r\nclimate. The sun's heat is tempered, even in summer, by cool nights, and\r\nin winter by cold winds, so that European constitutions do not, as in\r\nIndia, become enervated and European muscles flaccid. It is not\r\nnecessary to send children home to England when they reach five or six\r\nyears of age; for they grow up as healthy as they would at home.\r\nEnglishmen might, in many districts, work with their hands in the open\r\nair, were they so disposed; it is pride and custom, rather than the\r\nclimate, that forbid them to do so. So far, therefore, the country, is\r\none in which an indigenous white population might renew itself from\r\ngeneration to generation.\r\n\r\n_Wealth._--It was the hope of finding gold that drew the first British\r\npioneers to these regions; it is that hope which keeps settlers there,\r\nand has induced the ruling Company to spend very large sums in\r\nconstructing railways, as well as in surveying, policing, and otherwise\r\nproviding for the administration of the country. The great question,\r\ntherefore, is, How will the gold-reefs turn out? There had been formed\r\nbefore the end of 1895 more than two hundred Development Companies, most\r\nof them gold-mining undertakings, and others were being started up till\r\nthe eve of the native outbreak in March, 1896. Very many reefs had been\r\nprospected and an immense number of claims registered. The places in\r\nwhich actual work had been done in the way of sinking shafts and opening\r\nadits were, of course, much fewer, yet pretty numerous. Most of these\r\nwere in Manicaland, near Mtali, or to the north and west of Fort\r\nSalisbury, or to the south-east of Gwelo, in the Selukwe district. No\r\none of these workings was on a large scale, and at two or three only had\r\nstamping machinery been set up, owing, so I was told, to the practically\r\nprohibitive cost of transport from the sea. Accordingly, there were\r\nvery few, if any, workings where enough ore had been extracted and\r\ntreated to warrant any confident predictions as to the productivity of\r\nthe claim. Numerous as the claims are, the value of all, or nearly all,\r\nremained uncertain.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that in these mining districts the gold occurs in\r\nquartz-reefs. Comparatively little is found in alluvial deposits, which\r\nin California and Australia and the Ural mountains have often been more\r\nimportant than the quartz-reefs. None at all is found diffused equally\r\nthrough a stratum of rock, as in the Transvaal. Now, quartz-reef mining\r\nis proverbially uncertain. The reefs vary not only in thickness, but\r\nalso in depth, and it is not yet certain that any go very far beneath\r\nthe surface. So, too, even when the reef itself is persistent in width\r\nand in depth, its auriferous quality varies greatly. What is called the\r\n\"shoot\" of gold may be rich for some yards, and then become faint or\r\nwholly disappear, perhaps to reappear some yards farther. Thus there\r\nmust be a good deal of quartz crushed at different points before it can\r\nbe determined what number of pennyweights or ounces to the ton a given\r\nreef, or a given part of a reef, is likely to yield.\r\n\r\nIn this uncertainty and deficiency of practical tests, people have\r\nfallen back upon the ancient workings as evidence of the abundance of\r\nthe precious metal. I have already mentioned how numerous these workings\r\nare over the country, and how fully they appear to confirm the stories\r\nas to the gold which was brought down in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies to Sofala and the other Portuguese ports. It is argued that if\r\ngold was so extensively worked in time past by rude races possessing\r\nonly primitive methods and few tools, the reefs must have been rich, and\r\nthat it is extremely improbable that all, or nearly all, the gold should\r\nhave been already extracted. The old workings were open, excavated down\r\nfrom the surface, and they usually stopped when water was reached. Is\r\nthere not every reason to think that in many places the reefs go deeper,\r\nand that our improved scientific appliances will enable us to extract\r\nfar more of the metal than the old miners could get by their simple\r\nbreaking and washing of the quartz? No doubt the old workings were\r\ncarried on by labour incomparably cheaper than could now be obtained;\r\nbut against this may be set the greater efficiency of the machinery\r\nwhich will be at the disposal of the miner when transportation\r\nfacilities have been provided.\r\n\r\nArguments of this kind are resorted to only because the data which\r\nexperiment has hitherto supplied are insufficient. I found much\r\ndifference of opinion in the country itself regarding the value of the\r\nreefs. Some mining engineers took a less sanguine view of the reefs they\r\nhad examined than did the general public in Fort Salisbury or Bulawayo,\r\nand (it need hardly be said) a much less sanguine view than the\r\nprospectuses of the companies conveyed to investors at home. On the\r\nother hand, results had been actually obtained in some other places\r\nwhich promised extremely well if the rest of the reef proved equal to\r\nthe portion sampled. Men of what is called in America \"a conservative\r\ntemper\" seemed to think that there is \"payable gold,\" probably plenty of\r\ngold, in the country, and that out of the many companies formed to work\r\nthe claims a fair, but by no means a large, proportion will turn out\r\nsound undertakings. I doubt if it will be possible to say anything more\r\npositive until stamping batteries have been erected and a considerable\r\nquantity of quartz has been treated. This process can hardly begin till\r\nthe railways to Bulawayo and Mtali have been opened, and those\r\ninterested may therefore have to wait till 1899 or 1900 before they can\r\nfeel sure as to the value of their properties.[57]\r\n\r\nOther minerals besides gold have been found. There is iron in many\r\nplaces, copper in others. Coal has been proved to exist, of good if not\r\nfirst-rate quality, on the edge of the Zambesi Valley south of the\r\nVictoria Falls, and further east, to the north of Gwelo, and if the\r\ngold-reefs turn out well it will certainly be worked. Indeed, railways\r\nhave now (1899) been decided on to connect Bulawayo and Gwelo with these\r\ncoal basins. It may be added that a railway is now being constructed\r\nfrom Bulawayo to Gwelo and Fort Salisbury, and that there is a prospect\r\nof another being pushed on to the Zambesi and the boundary of northern\r\nRhodesia at the south end of Lake Tanganyika. A line is also to be made\r\nfrom Bulawayo south-east into the Gwanda mining district for a distance\r\nof 110 miles.\r\n\r\nRegarding the pastoral and agricultural capabilities of the country\r\nthere need be little doubt. All of it, except those lower grounds to the\r\nnorth and south-east which are infested by the tsetse-fly, is fit for\r\ncattle; some parts, such as the Matoppo Hills in Matabililand and still\r\nmore the Inyanga plateau in Mashonaland (mentioned in the last preceding\r\nchapter), offer excellent pasture. The \"high veldt\" of central\r\nMatabililand is no less available for sheep. Most of the cattle that\r\nwere on the land have perished in the recent murrain. But this plague\r\nwill pass by and may not return for many years, perhaps for centuries,\r\nand the animals that will be brought in to restock the country will\r\nprobably be of better breeds. The quality of the soil for the purposes\r\nof tillage has been tested by Europeans in a few places only. Much of\r\nit is dry; much of it, especially where the subjacent rock is granitic,\r\nis thin or sandy. Still, after allowing for these poorer tracts, there\r\nremains an immense area of land which is fit to raise cereals and some\r\nsubtropical crops such as cotton. The immediate question is not,\r\ntherefore, as to the productive capacities of the country, but as to the\r\nexistence of a market for the products themselves. Nearly all staple\r\nfood-stuffs have of late years become so cheap in the markets of Europe\r\nand North America, owing to the bringing under cultivation of so much\r\nnew land and the marvellous reduction in the cost of ocean carriage,\r\nthat in most of such articles Mashonaland, even with a railway to the\r\nsea, could not at present compete successfully in those markets with\r\nIndia and South America and the western United States. It is therefore\r\nto consumers nearer at hand that the country must look. If gold-mining\r\nprospers, population will rapidly increase, and a market will be created\r\nat the agriculturists' own door. If, on the other hand, the reefs\r\ndisappoint the hopes formed of them, and the influx of settlers is too\r\nsmall to create any large demand, tillage will spread but little, and\r\nthe country will be left to be slowly occupied by ranchmen. Thus the\r\ngrowth of population and the prosperity of every industry will depend\r\nupon the extent to which gold-mining can be profitably developed. Of\r\ncourse I speak only of the near future. However rich some of the reefs\r\nmay turn out, they will be exhausted within a few decades, and the\r\ncountry will have to depend on its other resources. However\r\nunremunerative the reefs may prove, these other resources will in the\r\nlong run assure to it a settled white population and a reasonable\r\nmeasure of prosperity. But these are days in which we all have learned\r\nto take short views of life for nations and countries as well as for our\r\nindividual selves, and unquestionably the more or less of gold in its\r\nquartz will for this country make all the difference between its speedy\r\nand its slow development.\r\n\r\n_Peace._--Thirdly, there remains the question whether the natives can be\r\nkept quiet. The first occupation of Mashonaland was so tranquil, the\r\nfirst conquest of the Matabili so swift and easy, that everybody\r\nperceives that some further trouble ought to have been expected before\r\nBritish control could be deemed secure. Now there has been a second\r\nstruggle and a pacification if not a victory. Has the suppression of the\r\nrevolt given permanent security? Are the natives at last aware that the\r\nsuperiority of intelligence and organization on the part of the whites\r\nmore than counterbalances their own immense preponderance in numbers, a\r\npreponderance of fully one hundred to one? No one will speak confidently\r\non this point who remembers how implicit and how vain was the confidence\r\nfelt in 1895 that the natives were contented and submissive. There was\r\nsome little risk of trouble in the spring of 1899 among the Matabili,\r\nbut the unrest became known in time, and is believed to have subsided.\r\nOn the whole, there is reason to think that if the natives are ruled in\r\na prudent and friendly spirit, making due allowance for their often\r\nunreasonable alarms and suspicions, no fresh rising need be feared. The\r\nchief aim of the ruling officials should be to draw and not to drive\r\nthem to labour, and to keep in check those white adventurers who hang\r\nabout the frontiers of civilization and sometimes ill-use or defraud the\r\nKafir in a way which makes him hostile to the next whites, however well\r\nintentioned, who come into his neighbourhood. It may be some years yet\r\nbefore the natives will seek work at the mines to the extent desired,\r\nfor they dislike underground labour. They were reported in 1899 to be\r\nstill deaf to the mine-owners' blandishments, although the average wage\r\nis £2 a month; and the want of labour is assigned as a cause why many\r\nmines said to be promising have made little progress. But policy, as\r\nwell as humanity and justice, forbids any resort to compulsion. Though\r\nit is quite true that the native hates to see the white men come in,\r\ndisturb his old way of life, and take the best land, still I doubt if\r\nanything less than some positive grievance, such as forced labour or the\r\ntaking of cattle, will be likely to rouse him to another attack on the\r\nstrangers. Should such an attack occur, it would be less formidable than\r\nthat of 1896. The tribal system, already weakened, tends among the\r\nMatabili to dissolve still further, as was seen by the absence of\r\nnotable leaders and the general want of plan and co-operation in the\r\nlate conflict. Among the Mashonas each village is independent, so that a\r\ncombined effort is still less to be feared.[58] Moreover the completion\r\nof the two railways to Bulawayo on the western and Fort Salisbury on the\r\neastern side of the country now enables reinforcements to be rapidly\r\nsent up from the coast, and has removed the only danger that really\r\nthreatened the whites in 1896--their isolation from help and from\r\nsupplies of ammunition and of food.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the general conclusions to which this rapid survey\r\nleads? I will summarise them.\r\n\r\n1. Though parts of the country will remain malarious, great areas will\r\nbe sufficiently healthy to enable a large white population to grow up\r\nand maintain itself on the soil in vigour of mind and body. In this\r\nsense it will be a \"white man's country.\"\r\n\r\n2. The black population is, however, likely to remain by far the more\r\nnumerous element, partly because it is better fitted for the malarious\r\nand the hottest regions, and partly because here, as elsewhere in South\r\nAfrica, it is by the blacks that nearly all manual labour will continue\r\nto be done. In this sense, that of numerical preponderance, the country,\r\nand of course especially the parts of it which lie near to and north of\r\nthe Zambesi, will be a \"black man's country.\"\r\n\r\n3. The material progress of the country, and the more or less rapid\r\nincrease of its white population, will depend, in the first instance, on\r\nthe greater or less success with which gold-mining is prosecuted. If the\r\nreefs turn out well, growth will be rapid; if not, it will be slow. But\r\nin the long run the soil and the climate will be the main factors in\r\nmaterial and social prosperity. These give abundant grounds for hope.\r\nThe rainfall is larger than in the interior of Cape Colony, and much of\r\nthe soil will therefore be more productive. Therewith other industries\r\nwill spring up; and some of them will remain even when mining has\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\n4. The political future will depend upon the growth of population, as\r\nthat depends upon the development of material resources. Should there be\r\na large and steady influx of white settlers, there must before long come\r\na demand for self-governing institutions. To concede these institutions\r\nwill be in the well-established line of British Colonial policy, and the\r\nquestion will then arise whether the country, or the more settled parts\r\nof it, should form a separate Colony or be incorporated with Cape Colony\r\n(as British Bechuanaland recently was). That one found in 1895 very\r\nlittle disposition among the white settlers to grumble at the\r\nadministration seemed chiefly due to the great personal popularity of\r\nthe genial Administrator, Dr. L. S. Jameson.\r\n\r\n5. In 1898 the government and administration of the region south of the\r\nZambesi, _i.e._, Matabililand and Mashonaland, theretofore in the hands\r\nof the British South Africa Company, were re-settled by an Order in\r\nCouncil (Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, October 20th, 1898). It\r\nvests authority in an Administrator appointed by the Company (with the\r\napproval of the Secretary of State for the Colonies), a Resident\r\nCommissioner, appointed by the Secretary of State and reporting directly\r\nto him, an Executive Council of four persons appointed by the Company,\r\ntogether with the senior and any other Administrators and the Resident\r\nCommissioner, and a Legislative Council consisting, besides the\r\nCommissioner and Administrators, of nine members, five appointed by the\r\nCompany, and four elected by the registered voters in electoral\r\ndistricts. The Resident Commissioner, though entitled to be present and\r\nspeak at meetings, has no vote. Legislative Ordinances may be vetoed by\r\nthe High Commissioner for South Africa or by the Secretary of State. The\r\npolice (a force of 1,200 is now maintained) are under the orders of the\r\nHigh Commissioner. There are various provisions for the protection of\r\nthe natives, and the recognition of native law; and it is provided (§\r\n47) that any \"customs duties to be levied are not to exceed the duties\r\nlevied at the commencement of the Order by the South African Customs\r\nUnion Tariff, or by the Customs Union Convention of May, 1898, whichever\r\nare higher.\"\r\n\r\nThis form of government is evidently provisional, and questions must\r\narise in the future, regarding the political constitution to be given to\r\nthis region and the relations of the Company to it, which will present\r\nmuch difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe country lying north of the Zambesi has been divided into two\r\ndistricts, North East Rhodesia and North West Rhodesia, each of which is\r\nplaced under an Administrator appointed by the Company, the extreme\r\nNorth Western strip, towards the Portuguese territory, remaining\r\nmeantime under the more direct authority of the High Commissioner. It\r\nis understood that these areas also are to be regulated by Orders in\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n6. Leaving out of sight the still unsettled problem of the mineral\r\nwealth of these territories, they are in other respects one of the most\r\npromising parts of South Africa. I have remarked that as regards pasture\r\nand agriculture they are superior to the inland parts of Cape Colony.\r\nThey are in these points also superior to the Transvaal, and still more\r\nplainly superior to the neighbouring possessions of Germany and\r\nPortugal. Portuguese East Africa is fever-stricken. German East Africa\r\nis in many places barren and almost everywhere malarious. German\r\nSouth-west Africa is largely desert, much of it an arid and\r\nirreclaimable desert.\r\n\r\nTo the English race in South Africa the acquisition of these regions, or\r\nat least of the parts south of the Zambesi, has been an immense\r\npolitical and economic advantage. It has established their predominance\r\nand provided a security against any serious attempt to dislodge them. A\r\nphilosophic observer without predilections for any one state or people\r\nwould, it is conceived, hold that the English race is more likely to\r\nserve what are termed the interests of civilization in this part of\r\nAfrica than is any other race. The Portuguese have neither energy nor\r\ncapital. The Germans, with energy and with capital, have not the\r\nrequisite practice in independent colonization, nor perhaps the taste\r\nfor it. The South African Dutch Boers, who have within the last\r\nseventeen years been more than once on the point of occupying the\r\ncountry, are, with all their good qualities, a backward people, who, had\r\nthey prevailed, would have done little more than squat here and there\r\nover the country with their cattle, and carry on an incessant desultory\r\nwar with the natives. Whether it is really desirable that the waste\r\nlands of the world should be quickly brought under settled order and\r\nhave their resources developed with all possible speed, is a question\r\non which much might be said. But assuming, as most men, perhaps too\r\nhastily, do assume, that this sudden development is desirable, the\r\nEnglish are the people most likely to carry it out effectively, and the\r\nstrong and strenuous man who, with little encouragement from the\r\ngovernment of his country, founded the British South Africa Company and\r\nacquired these territories for his countrymen, took one of the most\r\nfateful steps that statesman or conqueror has ever taken in the African\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: The above was written in 1897. The subsequent extension of\r\nthe railway from Mafeking to Bulawayo stimulated production, and in\r\nJuly, 1899, there were 115 stamps at work on the gold reefs, and the\r\ntotal value of the gold produced in Matabililand and Mashonaland\r\n(including the Tati concessions) was given by the Bulawayo Chamber of\r\nMines as £192,679 for the preceding ten months. The average wages paid\r\nto natives were £2 a month. Some reefs are stated to have been worked to\r\na depth of 500 feet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: This very isolation and independence of the small native\r\ncommunities in Mashonaland retarded the pacification of the country\r\nduring 1896-97. There were hardly any influential chiefs with whom to\r\ntreat. But since 1897 it has been perfectly quiet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHROUGH NATAL TO THE TRANSVAAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of reaching the Witwatersrand goldfields, now the\r\ncentral point of attraction in South Africa, from the south-east coast.\r\nOne route starts from Delagoa Bay, a place of so much importance as to\r\ndeserve a short description. It is a piece of water protected from the\r\nocean by Inyack Island, and stretching some twenty miles or more north\r\nand south. At the north end, where two rivers discharge their waters\r\ninto it, is an almost landlocked inlet, on the east side of which stands\r\nthe town of Lourenço Marques, so called from the Portuguese captain who\r\nfirst explored it in 1544, though it had been visited in 1502 by Vasco\r\nda Gama. The approach to this harbour is long and circuitous, for a\r\nvessel has to wind hither and thither to avoid shoals; and as the\r\nchannel is ill-buoyed, careful captains sometimes wait for the tide to\r\nbe at least half full before they cross the shallowest part, where there\r\nmay be only twenty feet of water at low tide. Within the harbour there\r\nis plenty of good deep anchorage opposite the town, and a still more\r\nsheltered spot is found a little farther up the inlet in a sort of\r\nlagoon. The town, which is growing fast, but still in a rough and\r\nunsightly condition, runs for half a mile along the bay front, while\r\nbehind a suburb is built up the slope of a hill facing to the west. The\r\nsite looks healthy enough, though it would have been better to plant\r\nthe houses nearer to the high point which shields the anchorage. But\r\nbehind the town to the east and north there are large swamps, reeking\r\nwith malaria; and the residents have, therefore, though of course much\r\nless in the dry season, to be on their guard against fever, which,\r\nindeed, few who remain for a twelvemonth escape. The Portuguese\r\nGovernment is unfortunately hard pressed for money and has not been able\r\nto complete the projected quays, nor even to provide a custom-house and\r\nwarehouses fit to receive and store the goods intended for the\r\nTransvaal, which are now discharged here in large quantities. In\r\nNovember, 1895, everything was in confusion, and the merchants loud in\r\ntheir complaints. Business is mostly in English and German, scarcely at\r\nall in Portuguese, hands. With better management and the expenditure of\r\na little money, both the approach to the harbour and the town itself\r\nmight be immensely improved; and although the country round is not\r\nattractive, being mostly either sandy or marshy, the trade with the\r\nTransvaal goldfields seems so certain to develop and maintain itself\r\nthat expenditure would be well bestowed. It has often been suggested\r\nthat Great Britain should buy or lease the place (over which she has a\r\nright of pre-emption), but the sensitive pride of Portugal might refuse\r\nany offer. Nevertheless, it needs no great boldness to foretel that some\r\nday it will come into British hands.\r\n\r\nThe other port which now competes for the Transvaal trade with Delagoa\r\nBay is Durban, the largest town in the British Colony of Natal. It\r\nstands on a sandy flat from which a spit of land runs out into the sea\r\nbetween the open ocean and the harbour. The harbour is commodious, but\r\nthe bar on the channel connecting it with the ocean formerly made it\r\nunavailable except for vessels of light draft. Although much had been\r\ndone by the Colony to deepen the channel, the largest steamers were (in\r\n1895) still forced to lie out in the ocean a mile or two away, and as\r\nthere is usually a swell, in which the little steam-tenders pitch about\r\npretty freely, the process of disembarkation is trying to many\r\npassengers. There is, however, good reason to hope that the bar\r\ndifficulties may ultimately be overcome, as they have already been\r\ngreatly reduced: and the harbour, once you are within it, is perfectly\r\nsheltered.\r\n\r\nDurban is a neat and, in some parts, even handsome town, incomparably\r\nsuperior to Lourenço Marques, with wide and well-kept streets, to which\r\nthe use of slender jinrickshas (drawn by active Zulus or Indians)\r\ninstead of cabs, as well as the number of white-clad coolies in the\r\nstreets, gives a curious Eastern touch, in keeping with the\r\nsemi-tropical vegetation. The climate is sultry during three months, but\r\nvery agreeable for the rest of the year. Many of the whites,\r\nhowever,--there are 14,000 of them, and about the same number of Kafirs\r\nand immigrants from India, live on the hill of Berea to the north of the\r\ntown, where the sea breeze gives relief even in the hottest weather.\r\nThis suburb of Berea is one of the prettiest spots in South Africa. The\r\nname, of which the origin seems to have been forgotten by the citizens\r\nof to-day, comes from a missionary settlement planted here in very early\r\ndays, and called after the Berea mentioned in Acts xvii. 10, 11. It has\r\nbeen skilfully laid out in winding roads, bordered by tasteful villas\r\nwhich are surrounded by a wealth of trees and flowering shrubs, and\r\ncommand admirable views of the harbour, of the bold bluff which rises\r\nwest of the harbour, and of the ocean. The municipality bought the land,\r\nand by selling or leasing it in lots at increased prices has secured a\r\nrevenue which keeps local taxation at a very low figure, and has enabled\r\nmany town improvements to be made and many enterprises to be worked for\r\nthe benefit of the citizens. Durban has been a pioneer of what is\r\ncalled, in its extremer forms, municipal socialism; and enjoys the\r\nreputation of being the best managed and most progressive town in all\r\nSouth Africa. It possesses among other things a fine town-hall with a\r\nlofty tower, built by the exertions of the present mayor, a deservedly\r\nrespected Scotch merchant.\r\n\r\nEast of Durban a low and fertile strip of country stretches along the\r\ncoast, most of which is occupied by sugar plantations, tilled by coolies\r\nbrought from India, because the native Kafir does not take kindly to\r\nsteady labour. North of the town the country rises, and here the patient\r\nindustry of other Indians has formed a great mass of gardens, where\r\nsub-tropical and even some tropical fruits are grown in great\r\nquantities, and have now begun to be exported to Europe. Across this\r\nhigh ground, and through and over the still higher hills which rise\r\nfarther inland, the railway takes its course, often in steep inclines,\r\nto the town of Pietermaritzburg, eighty miles distant, where the\r\nGovernor dwells, and a small British garrison is placed. Durban was from\r\nthe first an English town, and the white people who inhabit it are\r\npractically all English. Maritzburg was founded by the emigrant Boers\r\nwho left Cape Colony in the Great Trek of 1836, and descended hither\r\nacross the Quathlamba Mountains in 1838. Its population is, however,\r\nnowadays much more British than Boer, but the streets retain an\r\nold-fashioned half-Dutch air; and the handsome Parliament House and\r\nGovernment Offices look somewhat strange in a quiet and straggling\r\ncountry town. Its height above the sea (2500 feet) and its dry climate\r\nmake it healthy, though, as it lies in a hollow among high hills, it is\r\nrather hotter in summer than suits English tastes. The surrounding\r\ncountry is pretty, albeit rather bare; nor is the Australian wattle, of\r\nwhich there are now large plantations in the neighbourhood, a very\r\nattractive tree.\r\n\r\nThis seems the fittest place for a few words on the public life of\r\nNatal, the British Colony which has been the latest to receive\r\nresponsible self-government. This gift was bestowed upon it in 1893,\r\nnot without some previous hesitation, for the whole white population was\r\nthen about 46,000, and the adult males were little over 15,000. However,\r\nthe system then established seems to be working smoothly. There is a\r\ncabinet of five ministers, with two Houses of Legislature, an Assembly\r\nof thirty-seven, and a Council of eleven members, the former elected for\r\nfour years at most (subject to the chance of a dissolution), the latter\r\nappointed by the Governor for ten years. No regular parties have so far\r\nbeen formed, nor can it yet be foreseen on what lines they will form\r\nthemselves, for the questions that have chiefly occupied the legislature\r\nare questions on which few differences of principle have as yet emerged.\r\nAll the whites are agreed in desiring to exclude Kafirs and newcomers\r\nfrom India from the electoral franchise. All seemed in 1895 to be agreed\r\nin approving the tariff, which was for revenue only; and Natal had then\r\none of the lowest among the tariffs in force in British Colonies. (The\r\nordinary _ad valorem_ rate was five per cent.) In 1898, however, Natal\r\nentered the South African Customs Union previously consisting of Cape\r\nColony, the Orange Free State, Basutoland, and Bechuanaland, and the\r\ntariff of that Union, as fixed in 1898, was higher and to some extent\r\nprotective. Even between the citizens of English and those of Dutch\r\norigin, the latter less than one-fourth of the whole, and living chiefly\r\nin the country, there has been but little antagonism, for the Dutch,\r\nbeing less numerous than in Cape Colony, are much less organized. Among\r\nthe English, British sentiment is strong, for the war of 1881 with the\r\nTransvaal people not merely re-awakened the memories of the Boer siege\r\nof Durban in 1842, but provoked an anti-Boer feeling, which was kept in\r\ncheck only by the necessity of conciliating the Transvaal government in\r\norder to secure as large as possible a share of the import trade into\r\nthat country. As the Natal line of railway is a competitor for this\r\ntrade with the Cape lines, as well as with the line from Delagoa Bay,\r\nthere is a keen feeling of rivalry toward Cape Colony, which is thought\r\nto have been unfriendly in annexing the native territories of Griqualand\r\nEast and Pondoland, which lie to the west of Natal, and which the latter\r\nColony had hoped some day or other to absorb. When her hopes of\r\nterritorial extension were closed on that side, Natal began to cast\r\nlonging eyes on Zululand, a hilly region of rich pastures which is at\r\npresent directly administered by the Imperial Government, and which\r\ncontains not only some gold-reefs of still unascertained value, but also\r\ngood beds of coal. Ultimately in 1897, the home government consented to\r\nallow Natal to absorb both Zululand and the Tonga country all the way\r\nnorth to the Portuguese frontier.\r\n\r\nThe political life of Natal flows in a tranquil current, because the\r\npopulation is not merely small, but also scattered over a relatively\r\nwide area, with only two centres of population that rise above the rank\r\nof villages. The people, moreover, lead an easy and quiet life. They are\r\nfairly well off, occupying large cattle-farms, and with no great\r\ninducement to bring a great deal of land under tillage, because the\r\ndemand for agricultural produce is still comparatively small. Not much\r\nover one-fortieth part of the surface is cultivated, of which about two\r\nhundred thousand acres are cultivated by Europeans, of course by the\r\nhands of coloured labourers. Sugar is raised along the coast, and tea\r\nhas lately begun to be grown. The Natalians have, perhaps, become the\r\nless energetic in developing the natural resources of their country\r\nbecause thrice in their recent history the equable course of development\r\nhas been disturbed. In 1870 many of the most active spirits were drawn\r\naway to the newly-discovered diamond-fields of Kimberley. In 1879 the\r\npresence of the large British force collected for the great Zulu war\r\ncreated a sudden demand for all sorts of food-stuffs and forage, which\r\ndisappeared when the troops were removed; and since 1886 the rapid\r\ngrowth of the Witwatersrand gold-fields, besides carrying off the more\r\nadventurous spirits, has set so many people speculating in the shares of\r\nmining companies that steady industry has seemed a slow and tame affair.\r\nAt present not many immigrants come to Natal to settle down as farmers;\r\nand the Colony grows but slowly in wealth and population. Nevertheless,\r\nits prosperity in the long run seems assured. It is more favoured by\r\nsoil and by sky than most parts of Cape Colony. It has an immense\r\nresource in its extensive coal-fields. Its ocean trade and railway\r\ntraffic are increasing. In proximity to these coal-fields it has\r\ndeposits of iron which will one day support large industrial\r\ncommunities. And its inhabitants are of good, solid stuff, both English,\r\nDutch, and German, for there are many German immigrants. No British\r\nColony can show a population of better quality, and few perhaps one\r\nequally good.\r\n\r\nBesides the railway question, which is bound up with the problem of the\r\nport of Durban and its bar, the question which has most interest for the\r\npeople of Natal is that of the coloured population, Kafir and Indian.\r\nThe Kafirs, mostly of Zulu race, number 460,000, about ten times the\r\nwhites, who are estimated at 50,000. Nearly all live under tribal law in\r\ntheir own communities, owning some cattle, and tilling patches of land\r\nwhich amount in all to about 320,000 acres. The law of the Colony wisely\r\ndebars them from the use of European spirits. A few of the children are\r\ntaught in mission schools,--the only educational machinery provided for\r\nthem,--and a very few have been converted to Christianity, but the vast\r\nmajority are little influenced by the whites in any way. They are\r\ngenerally peaceable, and perpetrate few crimes of violence upon whites;\r\nbut however peaceable they may have shown themselves, their numerical\r\npreponderance is disquieting. A Kafir may, by the Governor's gift,\r\nobtain the electoral suffrage when he has lived under European law for\r\nat least seven years; but it has been bestowed on extremely few, so that\r\nin fact the native does not come into politics at all. The Indian\r\nimmigrants, now reckoned at 50,000, are of two classes. Some are\r\ncoolies, who have been imported from India under indentures binding them\r\nto work for a term of years, chiefly on the sugar plantations of the\r\ncoast. Many of these return at the expiration of the term, but more have\r\nremained, and have become artisans in the towns or cultivators of garden\r\npatches. The other class, less numerous, but better educated and more\r\nintelligent, consists (besides some free immigrants of the humbler\r\nclass) of so-called \"Arabs\"--Mahommedans, chiefly from Bombay and the\r\nports near it, or from Zanzibar--who conduct retail trade, especially\r\nwith the natives, and sometimes become rich. Clever dealers, and willing\r\nto sell for small profits, they have practically cut out the European\r\nfrom business with the native, and thereby incurred his dislike. The\r\nnumber of the Indians who, under the previous franchise law, were\r\nacquiring electoral rights had latterly grown so fast that, partly owing\r\nto the dislike I have just mentioned, partly to an honest apprehension\r\nthat the Indian element, as a whole, might become unduly powerful in the\r\nelectorate, an Act was in 1894 passed by the colonial legislature to\r\nexclude them from the suffrage. The home government was not quite\r\nsatisfied with the terms in which this Act was originally framed, but in\r\n1897 approved an amended Act which provides that no persons shall be\r\nhereafter admitted to be electors \"who (not being of European origin)\r\nare natives or descendants in the male line of natives of countries\r\nwhich have not hitherto possessed elective representative institutions\r\nfounded on the parliamentary franchise, unless they first obtain from\r\nthe Governor in Council an order exempting them from the provisions of\r\nthis Act.\" Under this statute the right of suffrage will be withheld\r\nfrom natives of India and other non-European countries, such as China,\r\nwhich have no representative government, though power is reserved for\r\nthe government to admit specially favoured persons. In 1897 another Act\r\nwas passed (and approved by the home government) which permits the\r\ncolonial executive to exclude all immigrants who cannot write in\r\nEuropean characters a letter applying to be exempted from the provisions\r\nof the law. It is intended by this measure to stop the entry of\r\nunindentured Indian immigrants of the humbler class.\r\n\r\nI have referred particularly to this matter because it illustrates one\r\nof the difficulties which arise wherever a higher and a lower, or a\r\nstronger and a weaker, race live together under a democratic government.\r\nTo make race or colour or religion a ground of political disability runs\r\ncounter to what used to be deemed a fundamental principle of democracy,\r\nand to what has been made (by recent amendments) a doctrine of the\r\nAmerican Constitution. To admit to full political rights, in deference\r\nto abstract theory, persons who, whether from deficient education or\r\nwant of experience as citizens of a free country, are obviously unfit to\r\nexercise political power is, or may be, dangerous to any commonwealth.\r\nSome way out of the contradiction has to be found, and the democratic\r\nSouthern States of the North American Union and the oligarchical\r\nRepublic of Hawaii (now (1899) annexed to the United States), as well as\r\nthe South African Colonies, have all been trying to find such a way. The\r\nproblem has in 1899 presented itself in an acute form to the United\r\nStates, who having taken hold of the Philippine Isles, perceive the\r\nobjections to allowing the provisions of their Federal Constitution to\r\nhave effect there, but have not yet decided how to avoid that result.\r\nNatal, where the whites are in a small minority, now refuses the\r\nsuffrage to both Indians and Kafirs; while Cape Colony, with a much\r\nlarger proportion of whites excludes the bulk of her coloured people by\r\nthe judicious application of an educational and property qualification.\r\nThe two Boer Republics deny the supposed democratic principle, and are\r\ntherefore consistent in denying all political rights to people of\r\ncolour. The Australian Colonies have taken an even more drastic method.\r\nMost of them forbid the Chinese to enter the country, and admit the\r\ndark-skinned Polynesian only as a coolie labourer, to be sent back when\r\nhis term is complete. France, however, is more indulgent, and in some of\r\nher tropical Colonies extends the right of voting, both for local\r\nassemblies and for members of the National Assembly in France, to all\r\ncitizens, without distinction of race or colour.\r\n\r\nMaritzburg is a cheerful little place, with an agreeable society,\r\ncentred in Government House, and composed of diverse elements, for the\r\nministers of state and other officials, the clergy, the judges, and the\r\nofficers of the garrison, furnish a number, considerable for so small a\r\ntown, of capable and cultivated men. There are plenty of excursions, the\r\nbest of which is to the beautiful falls of the Umgeni at Howick, where a\r\nstream, large after the rains, leaps over a sheet of basalt into a noble\r\n_cirque_ surrounded by precipices. Passing not far from these falls, the\r\nrailway takes its course northward to the Transvaal border. The line\r\nclimbs higher and higher, and the country, as one recedes from the sea,\r\ngrows always drier and more bare. The larger streams flow in channels\r\ncut so deep that their water is seldom available for irrigation; but\r\nwhere a rivulet has been led out over level or gently sloping ground,\r\nthe abundance of the crop bears witness to the richness of the soil and\r\nthe power of the sun. The country is everywhere hilly, and the scenery,\r\nwhich is sometimes striking, especially along the banks of the Tugela\r\nand the Buffalo rivers, would be always picturesque were it not for the\r\nbareness of the foregrounds, which seldom present anything except\r\nscattered patches of thorny wood to vary the severity of the landscape.\r\nToward the base of the great Quathlamba or Drakensberg Range, far to the\r\nwest of the main line of railway, there is some very grand scenery, for\r\nthe mountains which on the edge of Basutoland rise to a height of 10,000\r\nfeet break down toward Natal in tremendous precipices. At the little\r\ntown of Ladysmith a railway diverges to the Orange Free State, whose\r\nfrontier here coincides with a high watershed, crossed by only a few\r\npasses. A considerable coal-field lies near the village appropriately\r\nnamed Newcastle, and there are valuable deposits near the village of\r\nDundee also, whither a branch line which serves the collieries turns off\r\nto the east at a spot called Glencoe, south of Newcastle. Travelling\r\nsteadily to the north, the country seems more and more a wilderness, in\r\nwhich the tiny hamlets come at longer and longer intervals. The\r\nranching-farms are very large,--usually six thousand acres,--so there\r\nare few settlers; and the Kafirs are also few, for this high region is\r\ncold in winter, and the dry soil does not favour cultivation. At last,\r\nas one rounds a corner after a steep ascent, a bold mountain comes into\r\nsight, and to the east of it, connecting it with a lower hill, a ridge\r\nor neck, pierced by a tunnel. The ridge is Laing's Nek, and the mountain\r\nis Majuba Hill, spots famous in South African history as the scenes of\r\nthe battles of 1881 in the Transvaal War of Independence. Few conflicts\r\nin which so small a number of combatants were engaged have so much\r\naffected the course of history as these battles; and the interest they\r\nstill excite justifies a short description of the place.\r\n\r\nLaing's Nek, a ridge 5500 feet above the sea and rising rather steeply\r\nabout 300 feet above its southern base, is close to the Quathlamba\r\nwatershed, which separates the streams that run south into the Indian\r\nOcean from those which the Vaal on the north carries into the Orange\r\nRiver and so to the Atlantic. It is in fact on the south-eastern edge of\r\nthat great interior table-land of which I have so often spoken. Across\r\nit there ran in 1881, and still runs, the principal road from Natal into\r\nthe Transvaal Republic,--there was no railway here in 1881,--and by it\r\ntherefore the British forces that were proceeding from Natal to\r\nreconquer the Transvaal after the outbreak of December, 1880, had to\r\nadvance to relieve the garrisons beleaguered in the latter country.\r\nAccordingly, the Boer levies, numbering about a thousand men, resolved\r\nto occupy it, and on January 27 they encamped with their waggons just\r\nbehind the top of the ridge. The frontier lies five miles farther to the\r\nnorth, at the village of Charleston, so that at the Nek itself they were\r\nin the territory of Natal. The British force of about one thousand men,\r\nwith a few guns, arrived the same day at a point four miles to the\r\nsouth, and pitched their tents on a hillside still called Prospect Camp,\r\nunder the command of General Sir George Colley, a brave officer, well\r\nversed in the history and theory of war, but with little experience of\r\noperations in the field. Undervaluing the rude militia opposed to him,\r\nhe next day attacked their position on the Nek in front; but the British\r\ntroops, exposed, as they climbed the slope, to a well-directed fire from\r\nthe Boers, who were in perfect shelter along the top of the ridge,\r\nsuffered so severely that they had to halt and retire before they could\r\nreach the top or even see their antagonists. A monument to Colonel\r\nDeane, who led his column up the slope and fell there pierced by a\r\nbullet, marks the spot. Three weeks later (after an unfortunate skirmish\r\non the 8th), judging the Nek to be impregnable in front, for his force\r\nwas small, but noting that it was commanded by the heights of Majuba\r\nHill, which rise 1500 feet above it on the west, the British general\r\ndetermined to seize that point. Majuba is composed of alternate strata\r\nof sandstone and shale lying nearly horizontal and capped--as is often\r\nthe case in these mountains--by a bed of hard igneous rock (a\r\nporphyritic greenstone). The top is less than a mile in circumference,\r\ndepressed some sixty or seventy feet in the centre, so as to form a sort\r\nof saucer-like basin. Here has been built a tiny cemetery, in which some\r\nof the British soldiers who were killed lie buried, and hard by on the\r\nspot where he fell, is a stone in memory of General Colley. The hill\r\nproper is nearly nine hundred feet above its base, and the base about\r\nsix hundred feet above Laing's Nek, with which it is connected by a\r\ngently sloping ridge less than a mile long. It takes an hour's steady\r\nwalking to reach the summit from the Nek; the latter part of the ascent\r\nbeing steep, with an angle of from twenty to thirty degrees, and here\r\nand there escarped into low faces of cliff in which the harder sandstone\r\nstrata are exposed.\r\n\r\nThe British general started on the night of Saturday, February 26, from\r\nProspect Camp, left two detachments on the way, and reached the top of\r\nthe hill, after some hard climbing up the steep west side, at 3 A.M.,\r\nwith something over four hundred men. When day broke, at 5 A.M., the\r\nBoers below on the Nek were astonished to see British redcoats on the\r\nsky-line of the hill high above them, and at first, thinking their\r\nposition turned, began to inspan their oxen and prepare for a retreat.\r\nPresently, when no artillery played upon them from the hill, and no sign\r\nof a hostile movement came from Prospect Camp in front of them to the\r\nsouth, they took heart, and a small party started out, moved along the\r\nridge toward Majuba Hill, and at last, finding themselves still\r\nunopposed, began to mount the hill itself. A second party supported this\r\nforlorn hope, and kept up a fire upon the hill while the first party\r\nclimbed the steepest parts. Each set of skirmishers, as they came within\r\nrange, opened fire at the British above them, who, exposed on the upper\r\nslope and along the edge of the top, offered an easy mark, while the\r\nBoers, moving along far below, and in places sheltered by the\r\nprecipitous bits of the slope, where the hard beds of sandstone run in\r\nminiature cliffs along the hillside, did not suffer in the least from\r\nthe irregular shooting which a few of the British tried to direct on\r\nthem. Thus steadily advancing, and firing as they advanced, the Boers\r\nreached at last the edge of the hilltop, where the British had neglected\r\nto erect any proper breastworks or shelter, and began to pour in their\r\nbullets with still more deadly effect upon the hesitating and already\r\ndemoralized troops in the saucer-like hollow beneath them. A charge with\r\nthe bayonet might even then have saved the day. But though the order was\r\ngiven to fix bayonets, the order to charge did not follow. General\r\nColley fell shot through the head, while his forces broke and fled down\r\nthe steep declivities to the south and west, where many were killed by\r\nthe Boer fire. The British loss was ninety-two killed, one hundred and\r\nthirty-four wounded, and fifty-nine taken prisoners; while the Boers,\r\nwho have given their number at four hundred and fifty, lost only one man\r\nkilled and five wounded. No wonder they ascribed their victory to a\r\ndirect interposition of Providence on their behalf.\r\n\r\nThe British visitor, to whom this explanation does not commend itself,\r\nis stupefied when he sees the spot and hears the tale. Military\r\nauthorities, however, declare that it is an error to suppose that the\r\noccupants of a height have, under circumstances like those of this\r\nfight, the advantage which a height naturally seems to give them. It is,\r\nthey say, much easier for skirmishers to shoot from below at enemies\r\nabove, than for those above to pick off skirmishers below; and this fact\r\nof course makes still more difference when the attacking force are\r\naccustomed to hill-shooting, and the defenders above are not. But\r\nallowing for both these causes, the attack could not have succeeded had\r\nLaing's Nek been assailed from the front by the forces at Prospect Camp,\r\nand probably would never have been made had the British on the hill\r\ntaken the offensive early in the day.\r\n\r\nWe reached the top of the mountain in a dense cloud, which presently\r\nbroke in a furious thunderstorm, the flash and the crash coming together\r\nat the same moment, while the rain quickly turned the bottom of the\r\nsaucer-like hollow almost into a lake. When the storm cleared away, what\r\na melancholy sight was this little grassy basin strewn with loose\r\nstones, and bearing in its midst the graves of the British dead enclosed\r\nwithin a low wall! A remote and silent place, raised high in air above\r\nthe vast, bare, brown country which stretched away east, south, and west\r\nwithout a trace of human habitation. A spot less likely to have become\r\nthe scene of human passion, terror and despair can hardly be imagined.\r\nYet it has taken its place among the most remarkable battlefields in\r\nrecent history, and its name has lived, and lives to-day, in men's minds\r\nas a force of lamentable potency.\r\n\r\nCrossing Laing's Nek,--the top of which few future travellers will\r\ntread, because the railway passes in a tunnel beneath it,--one comes out\r\non the north upon the great rolling plateau which stretches to the\r\nZambesi in one direction and to the Atlantic in another. Four or five\r\nmiles further, a little beyond the village of Charleston, one leaves\r\nNatal and enters the South African Republic; and here is the actual\r\nwatershed which divides the upper tributaries of the Orange River from\r\nthe streams which flow to the Indian Ocean. The railway had just been\r\ncompleted at the time of our visit, and though it was not opened for\r\ntraffic till some weeks later, we were allowed to run over it to the\r\npoint where it joins the great line from Cape Town to Pretoria. The\r\njourney was attended with some risk, for in several places the permanent\r\nway had sunk, and in others it had been so insecurely laid that our\r\nlocomotive and car had to pass very slowly and cautiously. The country\r\nis so sparsely peopled that if one did not know it was all taken up in\r\nlarge grazing-farms, one might suppose it still a wilderness. Here and\r\nthere a few houses are seen, and one place, Heidelberg, rises to the\r\ndignity of a small town, being built at the extreme south-eastern end of\r\nthe great Witwatersrand gold-basin, where a piece of good reef is\r\nworked, and a mining population has begun to gather. The country is all\r\nhigh, averaging 5000 feet above sea level, and is traversed by ridges\r\nwhich rise some 500 to 1000 feet more. It is also perfectly bare, except\r\nfor thorny mimosas scattered here and there, with willows fringing the\r\nbanks of the few streams.\r\n\r\nGreat is the contrast when, on reaching Elandsfontein, on the main line\r\nof railway, one finds one's self suddenly in the midst of the stir and\r\nbustle of industrial life. Here are the tall chimneys of engine-houses;\r\nhere huge heaps of refuse at the shafts of the mines mark the direction\r\nacross the country of the great gold-reef. Here, for the first time\r\nsince he quitted the suburbs of Cape Town, the traveller finds himself\r\nagain surrounded by a dense population, filled with the eagerness, and\r\nfeeling the strain and stress, of an industrial life like that of the\r\nmanufacturing communities of Europe or of North America. Fifteen years\r\nago there was hardly a sign of human occupation. The Boer ranchman sent\r\nout his native boys to follow the cattle as they wandered hither and\r\nthither, seeking scanty pasturage among the stones, and would have been\r\nglad to sell for a hundred pounds the land on which Johannesburg now\r\nstands, and beneath which some of the richest mines are worked.\r\n\r\nThe Witwatersrand (Whitewatersridge) is a rocky ridge rising from one to\r\ntwo or three hundred feet above the level of the adjoining country and\r\nrunning nearly east and west about thirty miles. Along its southern\r\nslope the richest reefs or beds containing gold (except that near the\r\nvillage of Heidelberg) have been found; but the whole gold-basin, in\r\nvarious parts of which payable reefs have been proved to exist and are\r\nbeing worked, is nearly one hundred and thirty miles long by thirty\r\nmiles wide. It is called a basin because the various out-cropping reefs\r\nrepresent approximately the rim of a basin, and dip to a common centre.\r\nBut there are many \"faults\" which have so changed the positions of the\r\nreefs in different places as largely to obliterate the resemblance\r\nindicated by the term. It would be impossible to give either a\r\ngeological account of the district or a practical description of the\r\nmethods of working without maps and plans and a number of details\r\nunsuitable to this book; so I will mention merely a few salient facts,\r\nreferring the curious reader to the elaborate treatise of Messrs. Hatch\r\nand Chalmers published in 1895.\r\n\r\nThe Rand gold-mining district at present consists of a line of mines\r\nboth east and west of Johannesburg, along the outcrop of the principal\r\nreefs. It is about forty-six miles long, but \"gold does not occur\r\ncontinuously in payable quantities over that extent, the 'pay-ore' being\r\nfound in irregular patches, and (less frequently) in well-defined\r\n'pay-shoots' similar to those which characterize quartz-veins.\"[59]\r\nThere are also a few scattered mines in other parts of the basin. On\r\nthis line there are two principal reefs--the Main Reef, with its\r\nso-called \"leader,\" a thin bed just outside, and parallel to it, and the\r\nSouth Reef, with several others which are at present of much less\r\nimportance. The term \"reef\" means a bed or stratum of rock, and these\r\nRand reefs are beds of a sort of conglomerate, consisting of sandy and\r\nclayey matter containing quartz pebbles. The pebbles are mostly small,\r\nfrom the size of a thrush's egg up to that of a goose's egg, and contain\r\nno gold. The arenaceous or argillaceous stuff in which they lie embedded\r\nis extremely hard, and strongly impregnated with iron, usually in the\r\nform of iron pyrites, which binds it together. It is in this stuff, or\r\nsandy and ferreous cement, that the gold occurs. The Boers call the\r\nconglomerate \"_banket_\" (accented on the last syllable), which is their\r\nname for a kind of sweetmeat, because the pebbles lying in the cement\r\nare like almonds in the sugary substance of the sweetmeat. The gold is\r\npretty equably diffused in the form of crystals or (less often) of\r\nflakes--crystals of such extremely small size as to be very rarely\r\nvisible to the naked eye. Here and there, however, the banket is\r\ntraversed by thin veins of quartz rock, and nuggets, mostly quite small,\r\nare occasionally found in this quartz.\r\n\r\nThe \"Main Reef series\" consists of several parallel beds of varying size\r\nand thickness, which have not been correlated throughout their entire\r\nlength; at some points two may be workable; at others three. The Main\r\nReef bed varies from one to twenty feet in thickness; its \"leader,\"\r\nwhich is richer in gold, from three inches to three feet; and the South\r\nReef, also generally rich, from three inches to six feet. The Main Reef\r\nproper, however, is of too low an ore grade to be profitably worked\r\nunder present economic conditions, though at two or three mines a\r\npercentage of it is milled in conjunction with the richer ore from the\r\nother beds.\r\n\r\nWhere these beds come to the surface, they are inclined, or \"dip,\" as\r\ngeologists say, at an angle of from 60° to 30°, and the shafts are now\r\nusually sunk to follow the line of dip. But as they are followed down\r\ninto the earth, the angle diminishes to 30° or 25°, and it appears\r\ncertain that at a still greater depth they will be found to lie nearly\r\nhorizontal. This fact is extremely important, because it promises to\r\nmake a much larger part of the beds available than would be the case if\r\nthey continued to plunge downward at a high angle, since in that case\r\nthey would soon attain a depth at which mining would be impossible,\r\nbecause the heat would be too great, and probably unprofitable also,\r\nbecause the cost of raising the ore would be extremely heavy. The\r\ngreatest depth to which workings have been carried is about 2400 feet,\r\nbut skilled engineers think it possible to work as deep as 5000 feet,\r\nthough labour becomes more difficult above the temperature of 100°\r\nFahrenheit, which is reached at 3000 feet beneath the surface. No\r\ndifficulty from temperature has been felt at 2,400 feet, and the water\r\nis found to give little trouble; indeed a very experienced engineer (to\r\nwhose courtesy I am indebted for these facts) tells me that he thinks\r\nmost of the water comes from the surface, and can be taken up in the\r\nupper levels of the mine which is being worked at the depth mentioned. I\r\nhave given these details in order to show how enormous a mass of ore\r\nremains to be extracted when the deep workings, which are still in their\r\ninfancy, have been fairly entered upon. But a still more remarkable fact\r\nis that the auriferous banket beds appear, so far as they have been\r\nfollowed by deep borings, to retain, as they descend into the earth, not\r\nonly their average thickness, but also their average mineral quality.\r\nHere is the striking feature of the Rand gold-beds, which makes them, so\r\nfar as we know, unique in the world.\r\n\r\nEverywhere else gold-mining is a comparatively hazardous and uncertain\r\nenterprise. Where the metal is found in alluvial deposits, the deposits\r\nusually vary much in the percentage of gold to the ton of soil which\r\nthey yield, and they are usually exhausted in a few years. Where it\r\noccurs in veins of quartz-rock (the usual matrix), these veins are\r\ngenerally irregular in their thickness, often coming abruptly to an end\r\nas one follows them downward, and still more irregular and uncertain in\r\nthe percentage of gold to rock. For a few yards your quartz-reef may be\r\nextremely rich, and thereafter the so-called \"shoot\" may stop, and the\r\nvein contain so little gold as not to pay the cost of working. But in\r\nthe Witwatersrand basin the precious metal is so uniformly and equally\r\ndistributed through the auriferous beds that when you have found a\r\npayable bed you may calculate with more confidence than you can anywhere\r\nelse that the high proportion of gold to rock will be maintained\r\nthroughout the bed, not only in its lateral extension, which can be\r\neasily verified, but also as it dips downwards into the bowels of the\r\nearth. It is, therefore, not so much the richness of this\r\ngold-field--for the percentage of metal to rock is seldom very high, and\r\nthe cost of working the hard rock and disengaging the metal from the\r\nminerals with which it is associated are heavy items--as the comparative\r\ncertainty of return, and the vast quantity of ore from which that return\r\nmay be expected, that have made the Rand famous, have drawn to it a\r\ngreat mass of European capital and a large population, and have made the\r\ndistrict the object of political desires, ambition, and contests which\r\ntranscend South Africa and have threatened to become a part of the game\r\nwhich the great powers of Europe are playing on the chessboard of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the banket or conglomerate beds are of marine\r\norigin, but it does not follow that the gold was deposited _pari passu_\r\nwith the deposition of the beds, for it may have been--and skilled\r\nopinion inclines to this view--carried into the conglomerate seams\r\nsubsequently to their deposit. In this respect they resemble auriferous\r\nveins of quartz, though in these banket reefs the gold-bearing solutions\r\nwould seem to have come up through the interstitial spaces of the\r\nconglomerate instead of in the more or less open fissures of the\r\ngold-bearing quartz-veins. The chemical conditions under which gold is\r\nthus deposited are still conjectural. Gold has long been known to exist\r\nin sea-water, in the form of an iodide or a chloride; and one skilful\r\nmetallurgist at Johannesburg told me that he believed there was as much\r\ngold in a cubic mile of sea-water as the whole then annual output of\r\nthe Rand, that is to say, nearly £8,000,000.\r\n\r\nHad these deposits been discovered a century ago, few, if any of them,\r\nwould have been worth working, because miners did not then possess the\r\nnecessary means for extracting the gold from its intractable matrix. It\r\nis the progress of chemical science which, by inventing new processes,\r\nsuch as the roasting with chlorine, the treatment in vats with cyanide,\r\nand the application of electrical currents, has made the working\r\nprofitable. The expenses of working out the gold per ton of ore sank\r\nfrom £1 15_s._ 5_d._ per ton in 1892 to £1 8_s._ 1_d._ in 1898, while\r\nthe dividends rose from 8_s._ per ton to 13_s._ 2_d._; and the\r\nproportion of gold won which was paid in dividends rose from 19 to 32\r\nper cent. Further improvements in the processes of reduction will\r\ndoubtless increase the mining area, by making it worth while to develop\r\nmines where the percentage of metal to rock is now too small to yield a\r\ndividend. Improvements, moreover, tend to accelerate the rate of\r\nproduction, and thereby to shorten the life of the mines; for the more\r\nprofitable working becomes, the greater is the temptation to work as\r\nfast as possible and get out the maximum of ore. The number of stamps at\r\nwork in milling the ore rose from 3740 in 1896 to 5970 in August, 1899.\r\nThe total sum annually paid in dividends, which had in 1892 been\r\n£794,464, had in 1898 risen to £4,847,505.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the mines, as a whole, is therefore a difficult problem,\r\nfor it involves the question whether many pieces of reef, which are now\r\nlittle worked or not worked at all, will in future be found worth\r\nworking, owing to cheapened appliances and to a larger yield of gold per\r\nton of rock, in which case the number of mines may be largely increased,\r\nand reefs now neglected be opened up when the present ones have been\r\nexhausted. The view of the most competent specialists seems to be that,\r\nthough many of what are now the best properties will probably be worked\r\nout in twenty or thirty years, the district, as a whole, may not be\r\nexhausted for at least fifty, and possibly even for seventy or eighty,\r\nyears to come. And the value of the gold to be extracted within those\r\nfifty years has been roughly estimated at about £700,000,000, of which\r\nat least £200,000,000 will be clear profit, the balance going to pay the\r\ncost of extraction. In 1896 the value of the Witwatersrand gold output\r\nwas £7,864,341.[60] In 1898 it was £15,141,376; and in the first eight\r\nmonths of 1899 £12,485,032. Assuming a production of £15,000,000 a year,\r\nthis would exhaust the field in about forty-six years; but it is, of\r\ncourse, quite impossible to predict what the future rate of production\r\nwill be, for that must depend not only on the progress of mechanical and\r\nchemical science, but (as we shall presently see) to some extent also\r\nupon administrative and even political conditions. In the five years\r\npreceding 1896 the production had increased so fast (at the rate of\r\nabout a million sterling per annum) that, even under the conditions\r\nwhich existed in 1895, every one expected a further increase, and (as\r\nalready noted), the product of 1898 exceeded £15,000,000. With more\r\nfavourable economic and administrative conditions it will doubtless for\r\na time go still higher. The South African Republic now stands first\r\namong the gold-producing countries, having passed the United States,\r\nwhich stands a little behind her, Australasia being a good third, and\r\nthe Russian Empire a bad fourth. The total annual output of gold for the\r\nwhole world was in 1898 about £59,617,955.\r\n\r\nAmong the economic conditions I have referred to, none is more\r\nimportant than the supply and the wages of labour. On the Rand, as in\r\nall South African mines of every kind, unskilled manual labour is\r\nperformed by Kafirs, whites--together with a few half-breeds and Indian\r\ncoolies--being employed for all operations, whether within the mine or\r\nabove the ground, which require intelligence and special knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe number of natives regularly employed was in 1896 47,000, the total\r\nemployed altogether during the year 70,000. In 1898 these numbers had\r\nrisen to 67,000 and 88,000 respectively. The average monthly wage of a\r\nnative was in 1896 £3 0_s._ 10_d._ and in 1898 £2 9_s._ 9_d._ The number\r\nof whites employed was in 1896 7,430 (average monthly wage £24), in 1898\r\n9,476 (average monthly wage £26). Whites would be still more largely\r\nemployed if they would work harder, but they disdain the more severe\r\nkinds of labour, thinking those fit only for Kafirs. The native workmen\r\nare of various tribes, Basutos, Zulus, Shanganis, and Zambesi boys being\r\nreckoned the best. Most of them come from a distance, some from great\r\ndistances, and return home when they have saved the sum they need to\r\nestablish themselves in life. The dream of the mine manager is to cut\r\ndown the cost of native labour by getting a larger and more regular\r\nsupply, as well as by obtaining cheaper maize to feed the workmen, for\r\nat present, owing to the customs duties on food-stuffs, the cost of\r\nmaize--nearly all of which is imported--is much higher than it need be.\r\nSo white labour might be much cheapened, while still remaining far\r\nbetter paid than in Europe, by a reduction of the customs tariff, which\r\nnow makes living inordinately dear. Heavy duties are levied on machinery\r\nand chemicals; and dynamite is costly, the manufacture of it having been\r\nconstituted a monopoly granted to a single person. Of all these things,\r\nloud complaints are heard, but perhaps the loudest are directed against\r\nthe rates of freight levied by the railways, and especially by the\r\nNetherlands Company, which owns the lines inside the Transvaal State\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nEven apart from the question of railway freights, Johannesburg believed\r\nin 1895 that better legislation and administration might reduce the cost\r\nof production by twenty or thirty per cent., a difference which would of\r\ncourse be rapidly felt in the dividends of the mines that now pay, and\r\nwhich would enable many now unprofitable mines to yield a dividend and\r\nmany mines to be worked which are now not worth working.[61] However\r\nthis may be, an examination of the figures I have given will show how\r\ngreat has been the development of the industry during the last eight\r\nyears, how largely the dividends have grown and how much the cost of\r\nproduction has been reduced. Thus in spite of the difficulties\r\nmentioned, the profits made have greatly increased, and the shareholder\r\nhas fared well.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the natural aspect of the mining belt to distinguish\r\nit from the rest of the Transvaal plateau. It is a high, dry, bare,\r\nscorched, and windy country, and Johannesburg, its centre, stands in one\r\nof the highest, driest, and windiest spots, on the south slope of the\r\nWitwatersrand ridge, whose top rises some 150 feet above the business\r\nquarters. Founded in 1886, the town has now a population exceeding\r\n100,000, more than half of them whites. In 1896 the census (probably\r\nvery imperfect) showed within a radius of three miles 50,000 whites,\r\n42,000 Kafirs, and 6000 Asiatics. Though it is rapidly passing from the\r\nstage of shanties and corrugated iron into that of handsome streets\r\nlined with tall brick houses, it is still rough and irregular, ill\r\npaved, ill lighted, with unbuilt spaces scattered about and good houses\r\nset down among hovels.\r\n\r\nAnother element of unloveliness is supplied by the mines themselves, for\r\nthe chief reefs run quite close to the southern part of the town, and\r\nthe huge heaps of \"waste rock\" or refuse and so-called \"tailings\", the\r\nmachinery which raises, crushes, and treats the ore, and the tall\r\nchimneys of the engine houses, are prominent objects in the suburbs.\r\nThere is not much smoke; but to set against this there is a vast deal of\r\ndust, plenty from the streets, and still more from the tailings and\r\nother heaps of highly comminuted ore-refuse. The streets and roads\r\nalternate between mud for the two wet months, and dust in the rest of\r\nthe year; and in the dry months not only the streets, but the air is\r\nfull of dust, for there is usually a wind blowing. But for this dust,\r\nand for the want of proper drainage and a proper water-supply, the place\r\nwould be healthy, for the air is dry and bracing. But there had been up\r\nto the end of 1895 a good deal of typhoid fever and a great deal of\r\npneumonia, often rapidly fatal. In the latter part of 1896 the mortality\r\nwas as high as 58 per thousand.[62]\r\n\r\nIt is a striking contrast to pass from the business part of the town to\r\nthe pretty suburb which lies to the north-east under the steep ridge of\r\nthe Witwatersrand, where the wealthier residents have erected charming\r\nvillas and surrounded them with groves and gardens. Less pretty, but far\r\nmore striking, is the situation of a few of the outlying country houses\r\nwhich have been built to the north, on the rocky top or along the\r\nnorthern slope of the same ridge. These have a noble prospect over\r\nthirty or forty miles of rolling country to the distant Magaliesberg.\r\nEast and west the horizon is closed by long ranges of blue hills, while\r\nbeneath, some large plantations of trees, and fields cultivated by\r\nirrigation, give to the landscape a greenness rare in this arid land.\r\nStanding on this lonely height and looking far away towards the Limpopo\r\nand Bechuanaland, it is hard to believe that such a centre of restless\r\nand strenuous life as Johannesburg is so near at hand. The prospect is\r\none of the finest in this part of Africa; and it is to be hoped that a\r\ntract on these breezy heights will, before building has spread further,\r\nbe acquired by the town as a public park.\r\n\r\nThough in its general aspect Johannesburg comes nearer to one of the new\r\nmining cities of Western America than to any place in Europe, yet in\r\nmany points it is more English than American, as it is far more English\r\nthan Dutch. Indeed, there is nothing to remind the traveller that he is\r\nin a Dutch country except the Dutch names of the streets on some of the\r\nstreet corners. The population--very mixed, for there are Germans,\r\nItalians, and French, as well as some natives of India--is practically\r\nEnglish-speaking, for next in number to the colonial English and the\r\nrecent immigrants from Great Britain come the Australians and Americans,\r\nwho are for all social purposes practically English. It is a busy,\r\neager, restless, pleasure-loving town, making money fast and spending it\r\nlavishly, filled from end to end with the fever of mining speculation.\r\nThis pursuit concentrates itself in one spot where two of the principal\r\nstreets meet, and where a part of one of them is inclosed within low\r\nchains, so as to make a sort of inclosure, in which those who traffic in\r\ngold shares meet to buy and sell. \"Between the chains\" is the local\r\nexpression for the mining exchange, or share market, and a sensitive and\r\nunstable market it is. It had been \"booming\" for most of the year, and\r\nmany stocks stood far too high. But while we were there what is called a\r\n\"slump\" occurred, and it was pretty to study the phenomenon on the\r\ncountenances between the chains.\r\n\r\nThe passion of the people for sport, and especially for racing, is\r\ncharacteristically English. The gambling-saloon is less conspicuous than\r\nin Transatlantic mining-camps, and there are fewer breaches of public\r\norder. Decorum is not always maintained. When I was there, a bout of\r\nfisticuffs occurred between the ex-head of the town police and his\r\nrecently appointed successor, and the prowess of the former delighted a\r\nlarge ring of English spectators who gathered round the combatants. But\r\none hears of no shootings at-sight or lynchings; and considering the\r\ngreat number of bad characters who congregate at places of this kind, it\r\nwas surprising that the excess of crime over other South African towns\r\n(in which there is very little crime among the whites) should not have\r\nbeen larger. Partly, perhaps, because the country is far from Europe,\r\nthe element of mere roughs and rowdies, of scalawags, hoodlums, and\r\nlarrikins, is smaller than in the mining districts of the Western United\r\nStates, and the proportion of educated men unusually large. The best\r\nsociety of the place--of course not very numerous--is cultivated and\r\nagreeable. It consists of men of English or Anglo-Jewish race--including\r\nCape Colonists and Americans, with a few Germans, mostly of Jewish\r\norigin. I should conjecture the English and colonial element to compose\r\nseven-tenths of the white population, the American and German about\r\none-tenth each, while Frenchmen and other European nations make up the\r\nresidue. There are hardly any Boers or Hollanders, except Government\r\nofficials; and one feels one's self all the time in an English, that is\r\nto say, an Anglo-Semitic town. Though there are some 50,000 Kafirs, not\r\nmany are to be seen about the streets. The Boer farmers of the\r\nneighbourhood drive their waggons in every morning, laden with\r\nvegetables. But there are so few of the native citizens of the South\r\nAfrican Republic resident in this its largest town that the traveller\r\ncannot help fancying himself in the Colony; and it was only natural that\r\nthe English-speaking people, although newcomers, should feel the place\r\nto be virtually their own.\r\n\r\nGreat is the change when one passes from the busy Johannesburg to the\r\nsleepy Pretoria, the political capital of the country, laid out\r\nforty-three years ago, and made the seat of government in 1863. The\r\nlittle town--it has about 12,000 inhabitants, two-thirds of whom are\r\nwhites--lies in a warm and well watered valley--about thirty miles\r\nN.N.E. of Johannesburg. The gum-trees and willows that have grown up\r\nswiftly in the gardens and along the avenues embower it; and the views\r\nover the valley from the low hills--most of them now (since the middle\r\nof 1896) crowned by batteries of cannon--that rise above the suburbs are\r\npleasing. But it has neither the superb panoramic prospect nor the sense\r\nof abounding wealth and strenuous life that make Johannesburg striking.\r\nThe streets are wide, and after rain so muddy as to be almost\r\nimpassable; the houses irregular, yet seldom picturesque. Nothing could\r\nbe less beautiful than the big Dutch church, which occupies the best\r\nsituation, in the middle of the market square. There is, however, one\r\nstately and even sumptuous building, that which contains the Government\r\nOffices and chambers of the legislature. It is said to have cost\r\n£200,000. The room in which the Volksraad (_i.e._, the First or chief\r\nVolksraad) meets is spacious and handsome. It interests the visitor to\r\nnote that on the right hand of the chair of the presiding officer there\r\nis another chair, on the same level, for the President of the Republic,\r\nwhile to the right there are seats for the five members of the Executive\r\nCouncil, and to the left five others for the heads of the administrative\r\ndepartments, though none of these eleven is a member of the Raad.\r\n\r\nWe had expected to find Pretoria as Dutch as Johannesburg is English.\r\nBut although there is a considerable Boer and Hollander population, and\r\none hears Dutch largely spoken, the general aspect of the town is\r\nBritish colonial; and the British-colonial element is conspicuous and\r\ninfluential. Having little trade and no industry, Pretoria exists\r\nchiefly as the seat of the administration and of the courts of law. Now\r\nthe majority of the bar are British-colonials from Cape Colony or\r\nEngland. The large interests involved in the goldfields, and the\r\nquestions that arise between the companies formed to work them, give\r\nabundant scope for litigation, and one whole street, commonly known as\r\nthe Aasvogelsnest (Vulture's Nest), is filled with their offices. They\r\nand the judges, the most distinguished of whom are also either colonial\r\nDutchmen or of British origin, are the most cultivated and (except as\r\nregards political power) the leading section of society. It is a real\r\npleasure to the European traveller to meet so many able and well-read\r\nmen as the bench and bar of Pretoria contain; and he finds it odd that\r\nmany of them should be excluded from the franchise and most of them\r\nregarded with suspicion by the ruling powers. Johannesburg (with its\r\nmining environs) has nearly all the industry and wealth, and half the\r\nwhole white population of the Transvaal--a country, be it remembered, as\r\nlarge as Great Britain. Pretoria and the lonely country to the north,\r\neast, and west[63] have the rest of the population and all the power. It\r\nis true that Pretoria has also a good deal of the intelligence. But this\r\nintelligence is frequently dissociated from political rights.\r\n\r\nPresident Kruger lives in a house which the Republic has presented to\r\nhim, five minutes' walk from the public offices. It is a long, low\r\ncottage, like an Indian bungalow, with nothing to distinguish it from\r\nother dwellings. The President has, however, a salary of £7,000 a year,\r\nbesides an allowance, commonly called \"coffee money,\" to enable him to\r\ndefray the expenses of hospitality. Just opposite stands the little\r\nchapel of the so-called Dopper sect in which he occasionally preaches.\r\nLike the Scotch of former days, the Boers have generally taken more\r\ninterest in ecclesiastical than in secular politics. A sharp contest has\r\nraged among them between the party which desires to be in full communion\r\nwith the Dutch Reformed Church of Cape Colony and the party which\r\nprefers isolation, distrusting (it would seem unjustly) the strict\r\northodoxy of that church. The Doppers (dippers, _i.e._ Baptists) are\r\nstill more stringent in their adherence to ancient ways. When I asked\r\nfor an account of their tenets, I was told that they wore long\r\nwaistcoats and refused to sing hymns. They are, in fact, old-fashioned\r\nPuritans in dogmatic beliefs and social usages, and, as in the case of\r\nthe more extreme Puritans of the seventeenth century, this theological\r\nstringency is accompanied by a firmness of character which has given\r\nthem a power disproportionate to their numbers.\r\n\r\nQuiet as Pretoria is, the echoes of the noisy Rand are heard in it, and\r\nthe Rand questions occupy men's minds. But outside Pretoria the country\r\nis lonely and silent, like all other parts of the Transvaal, except the\r\nmining districts. Here and there, at long, intervals, you come upon a\r\ncluster of houses--one can hardly call them villages. If it were not for\r\nthe mines, there would not be one white man to a square mile over the\r\nwhole Republic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Mr. J. Hays Hammond, the eminent mining engineer, in\r\n_North American Review_ for February, 1897.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: The total output of the Californian gold deposits up to\r\nthe end of 1896 was £256,000,000. The total gold output of the Transvaal\r\nwas in 1898 $78,070,761 (about £16,000,000), that of the United States\r\n$65,082,430. I take these and the other recent figures from a report by\r\nMr. Hammond to the Consolidated Gold Fields of South Africa Company.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: A little French book (_L'Industrie Minière au Transvaal_,\r\npublished in 1897), which presents a careful examination of these\r\nquestions, calculated at about thirty per cent. of the expenditure the\r\nsavings in production which better legislation and administration might\r\nrender possible.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: There are towns in England where the rate is only 13 per\r\nthousand.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: There are some mines of gold and coal in other parts,\r\nmostly on the east side of the country, with a small industrial\r\npopulation consisting chiefly of recent immigrants.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE ORANGE FREE STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last preceding chapter I have carried the reader into the\r\nTransvaal through Natal, because this is the most interesting route. But\r\nmost travellers in fact enter _via_ Cape Colony and the Orange Free\r\nState, that State lying between the north-eastern frontier of the Colony\r\nand the south-eastern frontier of the Transvaal. Of the Free State there\r\nis not much to say; but that little needs to be said, because this\r\nRepublic is a very important factor in South African politics, and\r\nbefore coming to its politics the reader ought to know something of its\r\npopulation. I have already (Chapter V) summarized its physical features\r\nand have referred (Chapter XI) to the main incidents in its history.\r\nPhysically, there is little to distinguish it from the regions that\r\nbound it to the east, north, and west. Like them, it is level or\r\nundulating, dry, and bare--in the main a land of pasture. One\r\nconsiderable diamond mine is worked in the west, (at Jagersfontein) and\r\nalong the banks of the Caledon River there lies one rich agricultural\r\ndistrict. But the land under cultivation is less than one per cent, of\r\nthe whole area. There are no manufactures, and of course very little\r\ntrade; so the scanty population increases slowly. It is a country of\r\ngreat grassy plains, brilliantly green and fresh after rain has fallen,\r\nparched and dusty at other times, but able to support great numbers of\r\ncattle and sheep. Rare farmhouses and still rarer villages are scattered\r\nover this wide expanse, which, in the north-east, toward Natal, rises\r\ninto a mountainous region. The natives (most of them of Bechuana stock)\r\nare nearly twice as numerous as the whites. Some live on a large\r\nBarolong reservation, where they till the soil and keep their cattle in\r\ntheir own way. The rest are scattered over the country, mostly employed\r\nas herdsmen to the farmers. Save on the reservation, they cannot own\r\nland or travel without a pass, and of course they are not admitted to\r\nthe electoral franchise. They seem, however, to be fairly well treated,\r\nand are perfectly submissive. Their wages average thirty shillings a\r\nmonth. Native labour has become so scarce that no farmer is now\r\npermitted to employ more than twenty-five. Of the whites, fully\r\ntwo-thirds are of Dutch origin, and Dutch is pretty generally spoken.\r\nEnglish, however, is understood by most people, and is the language most\r\ncommonly used in the larger villages. The two races have lived of late\r\nyears in perfect harmony, for there has never been any war between the\r\nFree State and Great Britain. As the tendency of the English citizens to\r\nlook to Cape Colony has been checked by the sentiment of independence\r\nwhich soon grew up in this little Republic, and by their attachment to\r\nits institutions, so the knowledge of the Dutch citizens that the\r\nEnglish element entertains this sentiment and attachment has prevented\r\nthe growth of suspicion among the Dutch, and has knitted the two races\r\ninto a unity which is generally cordial.[64] Nevertheless, so much Dutch\r\nfeeling remained slumbering, that when it had been reawakened by Dr.\r\nJameson's expedition into the Transvaal in December, 1895, the scale\r\nwas decisively turned in favour of one out of the two candidates at the\r\nelection of a President which followed shortly thereafter, by the fact\r\nthat the one belonged to a Dutch, the other to a Scottish family. Both\r\nwere able and experienced men, the former (Mr. Steyn) a judge, the\r\nlatter (Mr. Fraser) Speaker of the Volksraad. It may be added that the\r\nproximity of the Colony, and the presence of the large English element,\r\nhave told favourably upon the Dutch population in the way of stimulating\r\ntheir intelligence and modifying their conservatism, while not injuring\r\nthose solid qualities which make them excellent citizens. The desire for\r\ninstruction is far stronger among them than it is in the Transvaal.\r\nIndeed, there is no part of South Africa where education is more valued\r\nand more widely diffused.\r\n\r\nThe only place that can be called a town is Bloemfontein, the seat of\r\ngovernment, which stands on the great trunk-line of railway from Cape\r\nTown to Pretoria, seven hundred and fifty miles from the former and two\r\nhundred and ninety from the latter town. It is what the Germans call a\r\n\"freundliches Städtchen,\" a bright and cheerful little place with 3,300\r\nwhite and 2,500 black inhabitants, nestling under a rocky kopje, and\r\nlooking out over illimitable plains to the east and south. The air is\r\ndry and bracing, and said to be especially beneficial to persons\r\nthreatened with pulmonary disease. As it is one of the smallest, so it\r\nis one of the neatest and, in a modest way, best appointed capitals in\r\nthe world. It has a little fort, originally built by the British\r\ngovernment, with two Maxim guns in the Arsenal, a Protestant Episcopal\r\nand a Roman Catholic cathedral as well as Dutch Reformed churches, all\r\nkinds of public institutions, a spacious market square, with a good club\r\nand an excellent hotel, wide and well-kept streets, gardens planted with\r\ntrees that are now so tall as to make the whole place seem to swim in\r\ngreen, a national museum, and a very handsome building for the\r\nlegislature, whose principal apartment is as tasteful, well-lighted, and\r\nwell-arranged as any I have seen in any British Colony or American\r\nState. The place is extremely quiet, and people live very simply, though\r\nnot cheaply, for prices are high, and domestic service so dear and\r\nscarce as to be almost unprocurable. Every one is above poverty, but\r\nstill further removed from wealth. It looks, and one is told that it is,\r\nthe most idyllic community in Africa, worthy to be the capital of this\r\ncontented and happy State. No great industries have come into the Free\r\nState to raise economic strife. No capitalists tempt the virtue of\r\nlegislators, or are forced to buy off the attacks of blackmailers. No\r\nreligious animosities divide Christians, for there is perfect religious\r\nfreedom. No difficulties as to British suzerainty exist, for the\r\nRepublic is absolutely independent. No native troubles have arisen. No\r\nprize is offered to ambition. No political parties have sprung up.\r\nTaxation is low, and there is no public debt. The arms of the State are\r\na lion and a lamb standing on opposite sides of an orange-tree, with the\r\nmotto, \"Freedom, Immigration, Patience, Courage\", and though the lion\r\nhas, since 1871, ceased to range over the plains, his pacific attitude\r\nbeside the lamb on this device happily typifies the harmony which has\r\nexisted between the British and Dutch elements, and the spirit of\r\nconcord which the late President Brand so well infused into the public\r\nlife of his Republic. In the Orange Free State I discovered, in 1895,\r\nthe kind of commonwealth which the fond fancy of the philosophers of\r\nlast century painted. It is an ideal commonwealth, not in respect of any\r\nspecial excellence in its institutions, but because the economic and\r\nsocial conditions which have made democracy so far from an unmixed\r\nsuccess in the American States and in the larger Colonies of Britain,\r\nnot to speak of the peoples of Europe, whether ancient or modern, have\r\nnot come into existence here, while the external dangers which for a\r\ntime threatened the State have, years ago, vanished away like clouds\r\ninto the blue.[65]\r\n\r\nAlthough, however, the political constitution of the Free State is not\r\nthe chief cause of the peace and order which the State enjoys, it may\r\nclaim to be well suited to the community which lives happily under it.\r\nIt is a simple constitution, and embodied in a very short, terse, and\r\nstraightforward instrument of sixty-two articles, most of them only a\r\nfew lines in length.\r\n\r\nThe governing authorities are the President, the Executive Council, and\r\nthe Volksraad or elective popular assembly. Citizenship belongs to all\r\nwhite persons born in the State, or who have resided in it for three\r\nyears and have made a written promise of allegiance, or have resided one\r\nyear and possess real property of the value of one hundred and fifty\r\npounds sterling, a liberality which is in marked contrast to the\r\nrestrictions imposed upon new comers by the laws of the Transvaal. Thus,\r\npractically, all the male white inhabitants are citizens, with full\r\nrights of suffrage--subject to some small property qualifications for\r\nnew comers which it is hardly worth while to enumerate.\r\n\r\nThe President is elected by the citizens for five years and is\r\nre-eligible. He can sit and speak but cannot vote in the Volksraad, is\r\nresponsible to it and has the general control of the administration.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Council consists of five members--besides the\r\nPresident--viz., the State Secretary and the Magistrate of Bloemfontein,\r\nboth of whom are appointed by the President and confirmed by the\r\nVolksraad, and three other members chosen by the Volksraad. It is\r\nassociated with the President for divers purposes, but has not proved to\r\nbe an important or influential body.\r\n\r\nThe Volksraad is elected by all the citizens for four years, half of\r\nthe members retiring every two years. It has only one chamber, in which\r\nthere sit at present fifty-eight members. It is the supreme legislative\r\nauthority, meeting annually, and in extra sessions when summoned, and\r\nits consent is required to the making of treaties and to a declaration\r\nof war. The President has no veto on its acts, and the heads of the\r\nexecutive departments do not sit in it.\r\n\r\nThe obligation of military service is universal on all citizens between\r\nthe ages of sixteen and sixty.\r\n\r\nThe constitution can be altered by the Volksraad, but only by a\r\nthree-fourths majority in two consecutive annual sessions. It is\r\ntherefore a Rigid constitution, like that of the United States and that\r\nof Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThis simple scheme of government seems calculated to throw nearly all\r\nthe power in the hands of the legislature, leaving the President\r\ncomparatively weak. Nevertheless, in point of fact the Presidents have\r\nbeen very important figures, partly because there have been no parties\r\nin the legislature, and therefore no party leaders. From 1863 till his\r\ndeath in 1888, the whole policy of the State was guided by President\r\nBrand, a lawyer from the Cape, whom the people elected for five\r\nsuccessive terms. His power of sitting in and addressing the Volksraad\r\nproved to be of the utmost value, for his judgment and patriotism\r\ninspired perfect confidence. His successor, Mr. F. W. Reitz, who at the\r\ntime of my visit (November, 1895) had just been obliged by ill-health to\r\nretire from office, enjoyed equal respect, and when he chose to exert\r\nit, almost equal influence with the legislature, and things went\r\nsmoothly under him. I gathered that Judge Steyn, who was elected\r\nPresident early in 1896, was similarly respected for his character and\r\nabilities, and was likely to enjoy similar weight. So the Speaker of the\r\nlegislature has been an influential person, because his office devolves\r\nupon him functions which the absence of a Cabinet makes important. The\r\nfact is that in every government, give it what form you please, call it\r\nby what name you will, individual men are the chief factors, and if the\r\ncourse of things is such that the legislature does not become divided\r\ninto parties and is not called on to produce conspicuous leaders,\r\ngeneral leadership will fall to the executive head if he is fit to\r\nassume it, and legislative leadership to the chairman of the assembly.\r\nWere questions to arise splitting up the people and the legislature into\r\nfactions, the situation would change at once. Oratorical gifts and\r\nlegislative strategy would become valuable, and the President or the\r\nSpeaker of the assembly might be obscured by the chiefs of the parties.\r\n\r\nThe people of the Free State were well satisfied with their\r\nconstitution, and showed little disposition to alter it. Some of the\r\nwisest heads, however, told me that they thought two improvements were\r\nneeded: a provision that amendments to the constitution, after having\r\npassed the Volksraad, should be voted on by the people (as in the Swiss\r\nReferendum), and a provision securing to the judges their salaries, and\r\ntheir independence of the Volksraad. It is interesting to notice that\r\nboth here and in the Transvaal the gravest constitutional questions that\r\nhave arisen turn on the relations between the legislative and the\r\njudicial departments. Some years ago the Free State Volksraad claimed\r\nthe right to commit a person to prison for contempt, and to direct the\r\nState attorney to prosecute him. The Chief Justice, a distinguished\r\nlawyer, and his colleagues felt bound to resist what they thought an\r\nunconstitutional stretch of power by the Raad. At first they seemed\r\nlikely to be defeated, but by using their opportunities of charging\r\njuries to insist on their views they brought public opinion round to\r\ntheir side, and the Raad ultimately retired from the position it had\r\ntaken up, leaving the question of right undetermined. It has never been\r\ndefinitely settled whether the courts of law are in the Free State (as\r\nin the United States), the authorized interpreters of the constitution,\r\nthough upon principle it would seem that they are. These South African\r\nConstitutions were drafted by simple men in an untechnical way, so that\r\nmany legal points obvious to the minds of English or American lawyers\r\nwere left untouched, and have now to be settled either on principle or\r\naccording to the will of what may happen to be the predominant power for\r\nthe time being. It is, perhaps, better that they should remain in\r\nabeyance until public opinion has grown more instructed and has had\r\nfuller opportunities of considering them.\r\n\r\nSmall as is the white population of the Orange Free State, its\r\ngeographical position and the high average quality of its citizens\r\nsecure for it a position of great significance in South African\r\npolitics; and the attitude it might take would be an important factor in\r\nany dispute between the British Government and the Transvaal Republic.\r\nThe troubles of December, 1895, drew it nearer to the Transvaal, for the\r\nFree State Boers have strong political sympathy with their northern\r\nkinsfolk. They were, at the time of my visit, far from approving the\r\npolicy of mere resistance to reform which President Kruger has taken up;\r\nand seemed quite indisposed to support the Transvaal if it should take\r\nany course at variance with its treaty engagements.[66] To this topic I\r\nmay have occasion presently to return. Meanwhile I pass on to describe\r\nthe native State which lies nearest to the Free State, which has been\r\nmost closely connected with its fortunes, and which in one respect\r\nfurnishes a parallel to it, having been of late years the most quiet and\r\ncontented among native communities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Mr. Brand was chosen President when practising law in Cape\r\nColony; and afterwards accepted, with the full assent of his citizens, a\r\nBritish order of knighthood.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Revising this book in October, 1899, I leave the above\r\npassage as it was written in 1897, grieving to think that it describes\r\nwhat has now become a past, and that the future is likely to have far\r\nother things in store.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: I leave this as written in 1897. The invasion of the\r\nTransvaal in December, 1895, led to the conclusion of an alliance\r\nbetween the Free State and that Republic, whereby each bound itself to\r\ndefend the other if attacked. The Free State has accordingly now\r\n(October, 1899), when hostilities have broken out between Britain and\r\nthe Transvaal, thrown in its lot with its sister Republic. This is what\r\nevery one who knew its history and the character of its people must have\r\nexpected.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nBASUTOLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nBasutoland is a comparatively small territory (10,300 square miles)\r\nsomewhat larger than Wales or Massachusetts. It is nearly all\r\nmountainous, and contains the highest summits in South Africa, some of\r\nthem reaching 11,000 feet. Few European travellers visit it, for it lies\r\nquite away from the main routes; it has no commercial importance, and\r\nits white population is extremely small, the land being reserved for the\r\nnatives alone. We were attracted to it by what we had heard of the\r\nscenery; but found when we came to traverse it, that the social\r\nconditions were no less interesting than the landscapes.\r\n\r\nThe easiest approach is from Bloemfontein. Starting from that pleasant\r\nlittle town one bright November morning on the top of the Ladybrand\r\ncoach, we drove over wide and nearly level stretches of pasture-land,\r\nwhich now, after the first rains, were vividly green, and beginning to\r\nbe dotted with flowers. The road was only a track, rough and full of\r\nruts, and the coach, drawn by eight horses, was an old one, whose\r\nsprings had lost whatever elasticity they might once have possessed, so\r\nthat it was only by holding tight on to the little rail at the back of\r\nthe seat that we could keep our places. The incessant pitching and\r\njolting would have been intolerable on an ordinary drive; but here the\r\nbeauty of the vast landscape, the keen freshness of the air, and the\r\nbrilliance of the light made one forget every physical discomfort. About\r\nnoon, after crossing the muddy flood of the Modder River, whose channel,\r\nalmost dry a month before, had now been filled by the rains, we entered\r\na more hilly region, and came soon after noon to the village of Thaba\r\n'Ntshu, called from the bold rocky peak of that name, which is a\r\nlandmark for all the country round, and is famous in history as the\r\nrallying-point of the various parties of emigrant Boers who quitted Cape\r\nColony in the Great Trek of 1836-37. Near it is a large native\r\nreservation, where thousands of Barolong Kafirs live, tilling the better\r\nbits of soil and grazing their cattle all over the rolling pastures.\r\nSome ten or fifteen miles farther the track reaches the top of a long\r\nascent, and a magnificent prospect is revealed to the south-east of the\r\nnoble range of the Maluti Mountains, standing out in the dazzling\r\nclearness of this dry African air, yet mellowed by distance to tints of\r\ndelicate beauty. We were reminded of the view of the Pyrenees from Pau,\r\nwhere, however, the mountains are both nearer and higher than here, and\r\nof the view of the Rocky Mountains from Calgary, on the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway. From this point onward the road mounts successive ridges,\r\nbetween which lie rich hollows of agricultural land, and from the tops\r\nof which nearer and nearer views of the Maluti range are gained. There\r\nwas hardly a tree visible, save those which Europeans have planted round\r\nthe farmhouses that one finds every seven or eight miles; and I dare say\r\nthe country would be dreary in the dry season or in dull grey weather.\r\nBut as we saw it, the wealth of sunlight, the blue of the sky above, the\r\nboundless stretches of verdure beneath, made the drive a dream of\r\ndelight. When the sun sank the constellations came out in this pure, dry\r\nAfrican air with a brilliance unknown to Europe; and we tired our eyes\r\nin gazing on the Centaur and the Argo and those two Magellanic clouds by\r\nwhich one finds the position of the southern pole. Soon after dark we\r\ncame to the top of the last high hill, and saw what seemed an abyss\r\nopening beneath. The descent was steep, but a beaten track led down it,\r\nreputed the most dangerous piece of road in the Free State; and the\r\ndriver regaled us with narratives of the accidents that had taken place\r\non the frequent occasions when the coach had been upset, adding,\r\nhowever, that nobody ever had been or would be killed while he held the\r\nreins. He proved as good as his word, and brought us safely to Ladybrand\r\nat 9 P.M., after more than twelve hours of a drive so fatiguing that\r\nonly the marvellously bracing air enabled us to feel none the worse for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLadybrand is a pretty little hamlet lying at the foot of the great\r\nflat-topped hill, called the Plaat Berg, which the perilous road\r\ncrosses, and looking out from groves of Australian gum-trees, across\r\nfertile corn-fields and meadows, to the Caledon River and the ranges of\r\nBasutoland. A ride of eight miles brings one to the ferry (which in the\r\ndry season becomes a shallow ford) across this stream, and on the\r\nfarther shore one is again under the British flag at Maseru, the\r\nresidence of the Imperial Commissioner who supervises the administration\r\nof the country, under the direction of the High Commissioner for South\r\nAfrica. Here are some sixty Europeans--officials, police, and\r\nstore-keepers--and more than two thousand natives. Neither here nor\r\nanywhere else in Basutoland is there an inn; those few persons who visit\r\nthe country find quarters in the stores which several whites have been\r\npermitted to establish, unless they have, as we had, the good fortune to\r\nbe the guests of the Commissioner.\r\n\r\nBasutoland is the Switzerland of South Africa and, very appropriately,\r\nis the part of South Africa where the old inhabitants, defended by their\r\nhills, have retained the largest measure of freedom. Although most of it\r\nis covered with lofty mountains, it has, like Switzerland, one\r\ncomparatively level and fertile tract--that which lies along the left\r\nbank of the Caledon River. Morija, the oldest French mission station,\r\nlies in a pretty hollow between five and six thousand feet above the\r\nsea,--nearly all Basutoland is above 5000 feet,--some sixteen miles\r\nsouth-east from Maseru. Groves of trees and luxuriant gardens give\r\nsoftness and verdure to the landscape, and among them the mission houses\r\nand schools, and printing-house whence Basuto books are issued, lie\r\nscattered about, up and down the slopes of the hill. Though there are\r\nplenty of streams in Basutoland, there is hardly any swampy ground, and\r\nconsequently little or no fever, so the missionaries invalided from the\r\nZambesi frequently come here to recruit. The station of Morija has been\r\nfor many years past directed by French-Swiss pastors, but the schools\r\nhave been under the charge of Scottish Presbyterian clergymen, of course\r\nin the service of the Paris Society, and they gave us a hearty welcome.\r\nThey have large and flourishing schools, from which a considerable\r\nnumber of young Kafirs go out every year among their countrymen and\r\nbecome an effective civilizing influence. There is among the Bantu\r\ntribes so little religion, in the European sense of the word, that the\r\nnatives seem never to have felt the impulse to persecute, and hardly\r\never to obstruct the preaching of Christianity. When opposition comes,\r\nit comes from the witch-doctor or medicine-man, who feels his craft in\r\ndanger, seldom from the chief. Here most of the leading men have been\r\nand still are on good terms with the missionaries. The Paramount Chief\r\nof the whole country lives three miles from Morija, at Matsieng, where\r\nhe has established, as the wont of the Kafirs is, a new kraal on the top\r\nof a breezy hill, forsaking the residence of his father in the valley\r\nbeneath. Here we visited him.\r\n\r\nLerothodi, the Paramount Chief, is the son of Letsie and grandson of\r\nMoshesh, and now ranks with Khama as the most important native potentate\r\nsouth of the Zambesi. He is a strong, thickset man, who looks about\r\nfifty years of age, and is not wanting either in intelligence or in\r\nfirmness. He was dressed in a grey shooting-coat and trousers of grey\r\ncloth, with a neat new black, low-crowned hat, and received the Deputy\r\nActing Commissioner and ourselves in a stone house which he has recently\r\nbuilt as a sort of council-chamber and reception-room for white\r\nvisitors. Hard by, another house, also of stone, was being erected to\r\nlodge such visitors, and over its doorway a native sculptor had carved\r\nthe figure of a crocodile, the totem of the Basutos. When a chief sits\r\nto administer justice among the tribesmen, as he does on most mornings,\r\nhe always sits in the open air, a little way from his sleeping-huts. We\r\nfound a crowd of natives gathered at the levee, whom Lerothodi quitted\r\nto lead us into the reception-room. He was accompanied by six or seven\r\nmagnates and counsellors,--one of the most trusted counsellors (a\r\nChristian) was not a person of rank, but owed his influence to his\r\ncharacter and talents,--and among these one spoke English and\r\ninterpreted to us the compliments which Lerothodi delivered, together\r\nwith his assurances of friendship and respect for the Protecting Power,\r\nwhile we responded with phrases of similar friendliness. The\r\ncounsellors, listening with profound and impressive gravity, echoed the\r\nsentences of the chief with a chorus of \"ehs,\" a sound which it is hard\r\nto reproduce by letters, for it is a long, slow, deep expiration of the\r\nbreath in a sort of singing tune. The Kafirs constantly use it to\r\nexpress assent and appreciation, and manage to throw a great deal of\r\napparent feeling into it. Presently some of them spoke, one in pretty\r\ngood English, dilating on the wish of the Basuto[67] tribe to be guided\r\nin the path of prosperity by the British Government. Then Lerothodi led\r\nus out and showed us, with some pride, the new guest-house he was\r\nbuilding, and the huts inhabited by his wives, all scrupulously neat.\r\nEach hut stands in an enclosure surrounded by a tall fence of reeds, and\r\nthe floors of red clay were perfectly hard, smooth, and spotlessly\r\nclean. The news of the reception accorded shortly before (in London) to\r\nKhama had kindled in him a desire to visit England, but his hints thrown\r\nout to that effect were met by the Commissioner's remark that Khama's\r\ntotal abstinence and general hostility to the use of intoxicants had\r\nbeen a main cause for the welcome given him, and that if other chiefs\r\ndesired like treatment in England they had better emulate Khama. This\r\nshot went home.\r\n\r\nFrom the chief's kraal we had a delightful ride of some twenty miles to\r\na spot near the foot of the high mountains, where we camped for the\r\nnight. The track leads along the base of the Maluti range, sometimes\r\nover a rolling table-land, sometimes over hills and down through\r\nvalleys, all either cultivated or covered with fresh close grass. The\r\nMalutis consist of beds of sandstone and shale, overlaid by an outflow\r\nof igneous rock from two to five thousand feet thick. They rise very\r\nsteeply, sometimes breaking into long lines of dark brown precipice, and\r\nthe crest seldom sinks lower than 7000 feet. Behind them to the\r\nsouth-east are the waterfalls, one of which, 630 feet high, is described\r\nas the grandest cascade in Africa south of the Zambesi. It was only two\r\ndays' journey away, but unfortunately we had not time to visit it.\r\n\r\nThe country we were traversing beneath the mountains was full of beauty,\r\nso graceful were the slopes and rolls of the hills, so bright the green\r\nof the pastures; while the sky, this being the rainy season, had a soft\r\ntone like that of England, and was flecked with white clouds sailing\r\nacross the blue. It was also a prosperous-looking country, for the rich\r\nsoil supported many villages, and many natives, men as well as women,\r\nwere to be seen at work in the fields as we rode by. Except where\r\nstreams have cut deeply into the soft earth, one gets about easily on\r\nhorseback, for there are no woods save a little scrub clinging to the\r\nsides of the steeper glens. We were told that the goats eat off the\r\nyoung trees, and that the natives have used the older ones for fuel. In\r\nthe afternoon we passed St. Michael's, the seat of a flourishing Roman\r\nCatholic mission, and took our way up the steep and stony track of a\r\nkloof (ravine) which led to a plateau some 6000 feet or more above\r\nsea-level. The soil of this plateau is a deep red loam, formed by the\r\ndecomposition of the trap rock, and is of exceptional fertility, like\r\nthe decomposed traps of Oregon and the Deccan. Here we pitched our tent,\r\nand found our liberal supply of blankets none too liberal, for the air\r\nwas keen, and the difference between day and night temperature is great\r\nin these latitudes. Next morning, starting soon after dawn, we rode\r\nacross the deep-cut beds of streams and over breezy pastures for some\r\nsix or seven miles, to the base of the main Maluti range, and after a\r\nsecond breakfast prepared for the ascent of the great summit, which we\r\nhad been admiring for two days as it towered over the long line of peaks\r\nor peered alone from the mists which often enveloped the rest of the\r\nrange. It is called Machacha, and is a conspicuous object from Ladybrand\r\nand the Free State uplands nearly as far as Thaba 'Ntshu. Our route lay\r\nup a grassy hollow so steep that we had thought our friend, the\r\nCommissioner, must be jesting when he pointed up it and told us that was\r\nthe way we had to ride. For a pedestrian it was a piece of hand and foot\r\nclimbing, and seemed quite impracticable for horses. But up the horses\r\nwent. They are a wonderful breed, these little Basuto nags. This region\r\nis the part of South Africa where the horse seems most thoroughly at\r\nhome and happy, and is almost the only part where the natives breed and\r\nride him. Sixty years ago there was not a horse in the country--the\r\nanimal, it need hardly be said, is not a native of South Africa. But in\r\n1852, the Basutos had plenty of ponies, and used them in the short\r\ncampaign of that year with extraordinary effect. They are small, seldom\r\nexceeding twelve hands in height, a little larger than the ponies of\r\nIceland, very hardy, and wonderfully clever on hills, able not only to\r\nmount a slope whose angle is 30° to 35°, but to keep their footing when\r\nridden horizontally along it. A rider new to the country finds it hard\r\nnot to slip off over the tail when the animal is ascending, or over the\r\nhead when he is descending.\r\n\r\nThe hollow brought us to a col fully 7500 feet above the sea, from which\r\nwe descended some way into a valley behind, and then rode for three or\r\nfour miles along the steep sides, gradually mounting, and having below\r\nus on the right a deep glen, covered everywhere with rich grass, and\r\nfrom the depths of which the murmur of a rushing stream, a sound rare in\r\nSouth Africa, rose up softly through the still, clear air. At length we\r\nreached the mountain crest, followed it for a space, and then, to avoid\r\nthe crags along the crest, guided our horses across the extremely steep\r\ndeclivities by which it sinks to the east, till we came to a pass\r\nbetween precipices, with a sharp rock towering up in the middle of the\r\npass and a glen falling abruptly to the west. Beyond this point--8500\r\nfeet or so above sea-level--the slopes were too steep even for the\r\nBasuto horses, and we therefore left them in charge of one of our Kafir\r\nattendants. A more rich and varied alpine flora than that which clothed\r\nthe pastures all round I have seldom seen. The flowers had those\r\nbrilliant hues that belong to the plants of our high European mountains,\r\nand they grew in marvellous profusion. They were mostly of the same\r\ngenera as one finds in the Alps or the Pyrenees, but all or nearly all\r\nof different species; and among those I found several, particularly two\r\nbeautiful _Gerania_, which the authorities at Kew have since told me are\r\nnew to science. It was interesting to come here upon two kinds of\r\nheath--the first we had seen since quitting the Cape peninsula, for,\r\nrich as that peninsula is in heaths, there are very few to be found in\r\nother parts of South Africa, and those only, I think, upon high\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nAfter a short rest we started for the final climb, first up a steep\r\nacclivity, covered with low shrubs and stones, and then across a wide\r\nhollow, where several springs of deliciously cold water break out. Less\r\nthan an hour's easy work brought us to the highest point of a ridge\r\nwhich fell northward in a precipice, and our Kafirs declared that this\r\nwas the summit of Machacha. But right in front of us, not half a mile\r\naway, on the other side of a deep semi-circular gulf,--what is called in\r\nScotland a _corrie_,--a huge black cliff reared its head 400 feet above\r\nus, and above everything else in sight. This was evidently the true top\r\nand must be ascended. The Kafirs, perhaps thinking they had done enough\r\nfor one day, protested that it was inaccessible. \"Nonsense,\" we\r\nanswered; \"that is where we are going;\" and when we started off at full\r\nspeed they followed. Keeping along the crest for about half a mile to\r\nthe eastward--it is an arëte which breaks down to the corrie in\r\ntremendous precipices, but slopes more gently to the south--we came to\r\nthe base of the black cliff, and presently discovered a way by which,\r\nclimbing hither and thither through the crags, we reached the summit,\r\nand saw an immense landscape unroll itself before us. It was one of\r\nthose views which have the charm, so often absent from mountain\r\npanoramas, of combining a wide stretch of plain in one direction with a\r\ntossing sea of mountain-peaks in another. To the north-east and east and\r\nsouth-east, one saw nothing but mountains, some of them, especially in\r\nthe far north-east, toward Natal, apparently as lofty as that on which\r\nwe stood, and many of them built on bold and noble lines. To the\r\nsouth-east, where are the great waterfalls which are one of the glories\r\nof Basutoland, the general height was less, but a few peaks seemed to\r\nreach 10,000 feet. At our feet, to the west and south-west, lay the\r\nsmiling corn-fields and pastures we had traversed the day before, and\r\nbeyond them the rich and populous valley of the Caledon River, and\r\nbeyond it, again, the rolling uplands of the Orange Free State, with the\r\npeak of Thaba 'Ntshu just visible, and still farther a blue ridge, faint\r\nin the extreme distance, that seemed to lie on the other side of\r\nBloemfontein, nearly one hundred miles away. The sky was bright above\r\nus, but thunderstorms hung over the plains of the Free State behind\r\nLadybrand, and now and then one caught a forked tongue of light flashing\r\nfrom among them. It was a magnificent landscape, whose bareness--for\r\nthere is scarcely a tree upon these slopes--was more than compensated by\r\nthe brilliance of the light and the clearness of the air, which made the\r\ncontrast between the sunlit valley of the Caledon and the solemn shadows\r\nunder the thunder-clouds more striking, and the tone of the distant\r\nranges more deep and rich in colour, than in any similar prospect one\r\ncould recall from the mountain watch-towers of Europe. Nor was the\r\nelement of historical interest wanting. Fifteen miles away, but seeming\r\nto lie almost at our feet, was the flat-topped hill of Thaba Bosiyo, the\r\noft-besieged stronghold of Moshesh, and beyond it the broad table-land\r\nof Berea, where the Basutos fought, and almost overcame, the forces of\r\nSir George Cathcart in that war of 1852 which was so fateful both to\r\nBasutoland and to the Free State.\r\n\r\nLess than a mile from the peak on which we sat, we could descry, in the\r\nprecipice which surrounds the great corrie, the black mouth of a cave.\r\nIt was the den of the cannibal chief Machacha, whose name has clung to\r\nthe mountain, and who established himself there seventy years ago, when\r\nthe ravages of Tshaka, the Zulu king, had driven the Kafir tribes of\r\nNatal to seek safety in flight, and reduced some among them, for want of\r\nother food, to take to human flesh. Before that time this mountain-land\r\nhad been inhabited only by wandering Bushmen, who have left marks of\r\ntheir presence in pictures on the rocks. Here and there among the crags\r\njabbering baboons darted about, and great hawks sailed in circles above\r\nus. Otherwise we had seen no living wild creature since we left the\r\npastures of the valley.\r\n\r\nThe summit of Machacha is composed of a dark igneous rock, apparently a\r\nsort of amygdaloidal trap, with white and greenish calcareous crystals\r\nscattered through it. The height is given on the maps as 11,000 feet;\r\nbut so far as one could judge by frequent observations from below and by\r\ncalculations made during the ascent, I should think it not more than\r\n10,500. It seems to be the culminating point of the Maluti range, but\r\nmay be exceeded in height by Mont aux Sources, eighty miles off to the\r\nnorth-east, where Basutoland touches Natal on the one side and the Free\r\nState on the other.\r\n\r\nDescending by a somewhat more direct route, which we struck out for\r\nourselves, we rejoined our horses at the pass where we had left them\r\nthree hours before, and from there plunged down the kloof, or ravine,\r\nbetween the precipices which led to the foot of the mountain. It was\r\nhere too steep to ride; indeed, it was about as steep a slope as one can\r\ndescend on foot with comfort, the angle being in some places fully 40° A\r\ngrand piece of scenery, for the dark rock walls rose menacing on either\r\nhand; and also a beautiful one, for the flowers, especially two\r\nbrilliant shrubby geraniums, were profuse and gorgeous in hue. At the\r\nbottom, after a very rough scramble, we mounted our horses, and hastened\r\nalong to escape the thunderstorm which was now nearly upon us, and which\r\npresently drove us for shelter into a native hut, where a Basuto woman,\r\nwith her infant hanging in a cloth on her back, was grinding corn\r\nbetween two stones. She went on with her work, and presently addressed\r\nmy wife, asking (as was explained to us) for a piece of soap wherewith\r\nto smear her face, presumably as a more fragrant substitute for the clay\r\nor ochre with which the Basuto ladies cover their bodies. The hut was\r\nclean and sweet, and, indeed, all through Basutoland we were struck by\r\nthe neat finish of the dwellings and of the reed fences which inclosed\r\nthem. When the storm had passed away over the mountains, \"growling and\r\nmuttering into other lands,\" and the vast horizon was again flooded with\r\nevening sunshine, we rode swiftly away, first over the rolling plateau\r\nwe had traversed in the forenoon, then turning to the north along the\r\ntop of the sandstone cliffs that inclose the valley of the Kaloe River,\r\nwhere Bushman pictures adorn the caves. At last as night fell, we\r\ndropped into the valley of the Kaloe itself, and so slowly through the\r\ndarkness, for the horses were tired, and the track (which crosses the\r\nriver four times) was rough and stony, came at last to the mission\r\nstation of Thaba Bosiyo. Here we were welcomed by the Swiss pastor in\r\ncharge of the mission, Mr. E. Jacottet, whose collection of Basuto and\r\nBarotse popular tales have made him well known to the students of\r\nfolk-lore. No man knows the Basutos better than he and his colleague,\r\nMr. Dyke of Morija; and what they told us was of the highest interest.\r\nNext day was Sunday, and gave us the opportunity of seeing a large\r\ncongregation of Basuto converts and of hearing their singing, the\r\nexcellence of which reminded us of the singing of negro congregations in\r\nthe Southern States of America. We had also two interesting visits. One\r\nwas from an elderly Basuto magnate of the neighbourhood, who was\r\nextremely anxious to know if Queen Victoria really existed, or was a\r\nmere figment of the British Government. He had met many white men, he\r\ntold us, but none of them had ever set eyes on the Queen, and he could\r\nnot imagine how it was possible that a great chieftainess should not be\r\nseen by her people. We satisfied his curiosity by giving full details of\r\nthe times, places, and manner in which the British sovereign receives\r\nher subjects, and he went away, declaring himself convinced and more\r\nloyal than ever. The second visitor was a lady who had come to attend\r\nchurch. She is the senior wife of a chief named Thekho, a son of\r\nMoshesh. She impressed us as a person of great force of character and\r\ngreat conversational gifts, was dressed in a fashionable hat and an\r\nenormous black velvet mantle, and plied us with numerous questions\r\nregarding the Queen, her family, and her government. She lives on the\r\nhill among her dependents, exerts great influence, and has done good\r\nservice in resisting the reactionary tendencies of her brother-in-law\r\nMasupha, a dogged and turbulent old pagan.\r\n\r\nThe mission station lies at the foot of the hill of Thaba Bosiyo, in a\r\nsingular region where crags of white or grey sandstone, detached from\r\nthe main mass of the tabular hills, stand up in solitary shafts and\r\npinnacles, and give a weird, uncanny look to the landscape. The soil is\r\nfertile and well cultivated, but being alluvial, it is intersected in\r\nall directions by the channels of streams, which have dug so deep into\r\nit that much good land is every year lost by the mischief the streams\r\nwork when in flood. The sides of these channels are usually vertical,\r\nand often eight, ten, or even twelve feet high, so that they offer a\r\nserious obstacle to travellers either by waggon or on horseback. The\r\nhill itself is so peculiar in structure, and has played such a part in\r\nhistory, as to deserve some words of description. It is nearly two miles\r\nlong and less than a mile across, elliptical in form, rising about five\r\nhundred feet above its base, and breaking down on every side in a line\r\nof cliffs, which, on the north-west and north side (toward the mission\r\nstation), are from twenty to forty feet high. On the other side, which I\r\ncould not so carefully examine, they are apparently higher. These cliffs\r\nare so continuous all round as to leave--so one is told--only three\r\nspots in the circumference where they can be climbed; and although I\r\nnoticed one or two other places where a nimble cragsman might make his\r\nway up, it is at those three points only that an attack by a number of\r\nmen could possibly be made. The easiest point is where a dyke of igneous\r\nrock, thirty feet wide, strikes up the face of the hill from the\r\nnorth-north-west, cutting through the sandstone precipice. The\r\ndecomposition of this dyke has opened a practicable path, from fifteen\r\nto twenty-five feet in width, to the top. The top is a large grassy\r\nflat, with springs of water and plenty of good pasture.\r\n\r\nIt was this natural fortress that the Basuto chief Mosheshwe, or, as he\r\nis usually called, Moshesh, chose for his dwelling and the stronghold of\r\nhis tribe, in A.D. 1824. The conquests of the ferocious Tshaka had\r\ndriven thousands of Kafirs from their homes in Natal and on both sides\r\nof the Vaal River. Clans had been scattered, and the old dynasties\r\nrooted out or bereft of their influence and power. In the midst of this\r\nconfusion, a young man, the younger son of a chief of no high lineage,\r\nand belonging to a small tribe, gathered around him a number of minor\r\nclans and fugitives from various quarters, and by his policy--astute,\r\nfirm and tenacious--built them up into what soon became a powerful\r\nnation. Moving hither and hither along the foot of the great Maluti\r\nrange, his skilful eye fixed on Thaba Bosiyo as a place fit to be the\r\nheadquarters of the nation. There was good land all round, the\r\napproaches could be easily watched, and the hill itself, made almost\r\nimpregnable by nature, supplied pasture for the cattle as well as\r\nperennial water. By tactfully conciliating the formidable tribes and\r\nboldly raiding the weaker ones, Moshesh rapidly acquired wealth (that is\r\nto say, cattle), strength and reputation, so that in 1836, when the\r\nemigrant Boers moved up into what is now the Free State, he was already\r\nthe second power north of the mountains, inferior only to the terrible\r\nMosilikatze. The latter on one occasion (in 1831) had sent a strong\r\nforce of Matabili against him. Moshesh retired into his hill, which he\r\ndefended by rolling down stones on the assailants; and when the invaders\r\nwere presently obliged to retreat for want of food, he sent supplies to\r\nthem on their way back, declaring his desire to be at peace with all\r\nmen. The Matabili never attacked him again. In 1833 he intimated to the\r\nmissionaries of the Paris Evangelical Society his willingness to receive\r\nthem, planted them at Morija, and gave them afterwards their present\r\nstation at the foot of Thaba Bosiyo, his own village being, of course,\r\non the top. Their counsels were of infinite value to him in the\r\ntroublous times that followed, and he repaid them by constant protection\r\nand encouragement. But though he listened, like so many Kafir chiefs, to\r\nsermons, enjoyed the society of his French friends, and was himself fond\r\nof quoting Scripture, he never became a Christian and was even thought\r\nto have, like Solomon, fallen in his old age somewhat more under heathen\r\ninfluences. Many were the wars he had to sustain with the native tribes\r\nwho lived round him, as well as with the white settlers in the Orange\r\nRiver territory to the north, and many the escapes from danger which his\r\ncrafty and versatile policy secured. Two of these wars deserve special\r\nmention, for both are connected with the place I am describing. In\r\nDecember, 1852, Sir George Cathcart, then Governor of Cape Colony,\r\ncrossed the Caledon River a little above Maseru and led a force of two\r\nthousand British infantry and five hundred cavalry, besides artillery,\r\nagainst the Basutos. One of the three divisions in which the army moved\r\nwas led into an ambush, severely handled by the nimble Basuto horsemen,\r\nand obliged to retreat. The division which Sir George himself led found\r\nitself confronted, when it reached the foot of Thaba Bosiyo, by a body\r\nof Basutos so numerous and active that it had great difficulty in\r\nholding its ground, and might have been destroyed but for the timely\r\narrival of the third division just before sunset. The British general\r\nintrenched himself for the night in a strong position; and next morning,\r\nrealizing at length the difficulties of his enterprise, set out to\r\nretire to the Caledon River. Before he reached it, however, a message\r\nfrom Moshesh overtook him. That wary chief, who knew the real strength\r\nof the British better than did his people, had been driven into the war\r\nby their over-confidence and their reluctance to pay the cattle fine\r\nwhich the Governor had demanded. Now that there was a chance of getting\r\nout of it he resolved to seize that chance, and after a consultation\r\nwith one of the French missionaries, begged Sir George Cathcart for\r\npeace, acknowledging himself to be the weaker party, and declaring that\r\nhe would do his best to keep his tribesmen in order. The Governor, glad\r\nto be thus relieved of what might have proved a long and troublesome\r\nwar, accepted these overtures. The British army was marched back to Cape\r\nColony, and Moshesh thereafter enjoyed the fame of being the only native\r\npotentate who had come out of a struggle with Great Britain virtually if\r\nnot formally the victor.\r\n\r\nBut a still severer ordeal was in store for the virgin fortress and its\r\nlord. After much indecisive strife, the whites and the Basutos were, in\r\n1865, again engaged in a serious war. The people of what had then become\r\n(see Chapter XI) the Orange Free State had found the Basutos troublesome\r\nneighbours, and a dispute had arisen regarding the frontier line. The\r\nFree State militia, well practised in native warfare, invaded\r\nBasutoland, reduced many of the native strongholds and besieged Thaba\r\nBosiyo. A storming party advanced to carry the hill by assault, mounting\r\nthe steep open acclivity to the passage which is opened (as already\r\nmentioned) by the greenstone dyke as it cuts its way through the line of\r\nsandstone cliff. They had driven the Basutos before them, and had\r\nreached a point where the path leads up a narrow cleft formed by the\r\ndecomposition of the dyke, between walls of rock some twenty feet high.\r\nThirty yards more would have brought them to the open top of the hill,\r\nand Moshesh would have been at their mercy. But at this moment a bullet\r\nfrom one of the few muskets which the defenders possessed, fired by a\r\ngood marksman from the rock above the cleft, pierced Wepener, the leader\r\nof the assailants. The storming party halted, hesitated, fell back to\r\nthe bottom of the hill, and the place was once more saved. Not long\r\nafter, Moshesh, finding himself likely to be overmastered, besought the\r\nImperial Government, which had always regarded him with favour since the\r\nconclusion of Sir George Cathcart's war, to receive him and his people\r\n\"and let them live under the large folds of the flag of England.\" The\r\nHigh Commissioner intervened, declaring the Basutos to be thenceforward\r\nBritish subjects, and in 1869 a peace was concluded with the Free State,\r\nby which the latter obtained a fertile strip of territory along the\r\nnorth-west branch of the Caledon which had previously been held by\r\nMoshesh, while the Basutos came (in 1871) under the administrative\r\ncontrol of Cape Colony. Moshesh died soon afterwards, full of years and\r\nhonour, and leaving a name which has become famous in South Africa. He\r\nwas one of the remarkable instances, like Toussaint l'Ouverture and the\r\nHawaiian king Kamehameha the First, of a man, sprung from a savage race,\r\nwho effected great things by a display of wholly exceptional gifts. His\r\nsayings have become proverbs in native mouths. One of them is worth\r\nnoting, as a piece of grim humour, a quality rare among the Kafirs. Some\r\nof his chief men had been urging him, after he had become powerful, to\r\ntake vengeance upon certain cannibals who were believed to have killed\r\nand eaten his grandparents. Moshesh replied: \"I must consider well\r\nbefore I disturb the sepulchres of my ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nBasutoland remained quiet till 1879, when the Cape Government, urged, it\r\nwould appear, by the restless spirit of Sir Bartle Frere (then\r\nGovernor), conceived the unhappy project of disarming the Basutos. It\r\nwas no doubt a pity that so many of them possessed firearms; but it\r\nwould have been better to let them keep their weapons than to provoke a\r\nwar; and the Cape Prime Minister, who met the nation in its great\r\npopular assembly, the Pitso, had ample notice through the speeches\r\ndelivered there by important chiefs of the resistance with which any\r\nattempt to enforce disarmament would be met. However, rash counsels\r\nprevailed. The attempt was made in 1880; war followed, and the Basutos\r\ngave the colonial troops so much trouble that in 1883 the Colony\r\nproposed to abandon the territory altogether. Ultimately, in 1884, the\r\nImperial Government took it over, and has ever since administered it by\r\na Resident Commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe Basuto nation, which had been brought very low at the time when\r\nMoshesh threw himself upon the British Government for protection, has\r\nlatterly grown rapidly, and now numbers over 220,000 souls. This\r\nincrease is partly due to an influx of Kafirs from other tribes, each\r\nchief encouraging the influx, since the new retainers, who surround him,\r\nincrease his importance. But it has now reached a point when it ought to\r\nbe stopped, because all the agricultural land is taken up for tillage,\r\nand the pastures begin scarcely to suffice for the cattle. The area is\r\n10,263 square miles, about two-thirds that of Switzerland, but by far\r\nthe larger part of it is wild mountain. No Europeans are allowed to hold\r\nland, and a licence is needed even for the keeping of a store. Neither\r\nare any mines worked. European prospectors are not permitted to come in\r\nand search for minerals, for the policy of the authorities has been to\r\nkeep the country for the natives; and nothing alarms the chiefs so much\r\nas the occasional appearance of these speculative gentry, who, if\r\nallowed a foothold, would soon dispossess them. Thus it remains doubtful\r\nwhether either gold or silver or diamonds exist in \"payable\r\nquantities.\"\r\n\r\nThe natives, however, go in large numbers--in 1895-6 as many as 28,000\r\nwent out--to work in the mines at Kimberley and on the Witwatersrand,\r\nand they bring back savings, which have done much to increase the\r\nprosperity of the tribe. At present they seem fairly contented and\r\npeaceable. The land belongs to the nation, and all may freely turn their\r\ncattle on the untilled parts. Fields, however, are allotted to each\r\nhouseholder by the chief, to be tilled, and the tenant, protected by\r\npublic opinion, retains them so long as he tills them. He cannot sell\r\nthem, but they will pass to his children. Ordinary administration, which\r\nconsists mainly in the allotment and management of land, is left to the\r\nchief; as also ordinary jurisdiction, both civil and criminal. The\r\npresent tendency is for the disposing power of the chief over the land\r\nto increase; and it is possible that British law may ultimately turn\r\nhim, as it turned the head of an Irish sept, into an owner. The chief\r\nholds his court at his kraal, in the open air, settles disputes and\r\nawards punishments. There are several British magistrates to deal with\r\ngrave offences, and a force of 220 native police, under British\r\nofficers. Lerothodi, as the successor of Moshesh, is Paramount Chief of\r\nthe nation; and all the greater chieftainships under him are held by his\r\nuncles and cousins,--sons and grandsons of the founder of the\r\ndynasty,--while there are also a few chiefs of the second rank belonging\r\nto other families. Some of the uncles, especially Masupha, who lives at\r\nthe foot of Thaba Bosiyo, and is an obstinately conservative heathen,\r\ngive trouble both to Lerothodi and to the British Commissioner, their\r\nquarrels turning mainly on questions of land and frontier. But on the\r\nwhole, things go on as well as can be expected in such a world as the\r\npresent: disturbances tend to diminish; and the horses or cattle that\r\nare occasionally stolen from the Free State farmers are always recovered\r\nfor their owners, unless they have been got away out of Basutoland into\r\nthe colonial territories to the south and west. As far back as 1855,\r\nMoshesh forbade the \"smelling out\" of witches, and now the British\r\nauthorities have suppressed the more noxious or offensive kinds of\r\nceremonies practised by the Kafirs. Otherwise they interfere as little\r\nas may be with native ways, trusting to time, peace, and the\r\nmissionaries to secure the gradual civilization of the people. Once a\r\nyear the Commissioner meets the whole people, in their national assembly\r\ncalled the Pitso,--the name is derived from their verb \"to call\" (cf.\r\n[Greek: ekklêsia])--which in several points recalls the _agora_, or\r\nassembly of freemen described in the Homeric poems. The Paramount Chief\r\npresides, and debate is mainly conducted by the chiefs; but all freemen,\r\ngentle and simple, have a right to speak in it. There is no voting, only\r\na declaration, by shouts, of the general feeling. Though the head of the\r\nnation has been usually the person who convokes it, a magnate lower in\r\nrank might always, like Achilles in the Iliad, have it summoned when a\r\nfitting occasion arose. And it was generally preceded by a consultation\r\namong the leading men, though I could not discover that there was any\r\nregular council of chiefs.[68] In all these points the resemblance to\r\nthe primary assemblies of the early peoples of Europe is close enough to\r\nadd another to the arguments, already strong, which discredit the theory\r\nthat there is any such thing as an \"Aryan type\" of institutions, and\r\nwhich suggest the view that in studying the polities of primitive\r\nnations we must not take affinities of language as the basis of a\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Pitso has lost much of its old importance, and tends to\r\nbecome a formal meeting, in which the British Commissioner causes new\r\nregulations to be read aloud, inviting discussion on points which any\r\none present may desire to raise, and addresses the people, awarding\r\npraise or blame, and adding such exhortations as he thinks seasonable.\r\nThe missionaries (like the Bishops in a Witenagemot) and the chief\r\nBritish officials are usually present. In perusing the shorthand report\r\nof the great Pitso held in 1879, at which the question of disarmament\r\nwas brought forward by the Cape Prime Minister, I was struck by the\r\nfreedom and intelligence with which the speakers delivered their views.\r\nOne observed: \"This is our parliament, though it is a very disorderly\r\nparliament, because we are all mixed up, young and old; and we cannot\r\naccept any measure without discussion.\" Another commented severely upon\r\nan unhappy phrase that had been used at Cape Town by a member of the\r\nCape Government: \"Mr. U. said the Basutos were the natural enemies of\r\nthe white man, because we were black. Is that language which should be\r\nused by a high officer of the Government? Let sentiments like these pass\r\naway--we are being educated to believe that all people are equal, and\r\nfeel that sentiments like these are utterly wrong.\" A third claimed that\r\nthe people must keep their guns, because \"at our circumcision we were\r\ngiven a shield and an assagai, and told never to part with them; and\r\nthat if ever we came back from an expedition and our shield and assagai\r\nwere not found before our house, we should die the death.\" And a fourth,\r\nwishing to excuse any vehement expression he might use, observed: \"We\r\nhave a proverb which says that a man who makes a mistake in a public\r\nassembly cannot be killed.\" In this proverb there is the germ of the\r\nEnglish \"privilege of Parliament.\" It is easy to gather from the whole\r\nproceedings of these Pitsos how much more popular government has been\r\namong the Basutos than it was among the Zulus or Matabili. Tshaka or Lo\r\nBengula would in a moment have had the neck twisted of any one who\r\nventured to differ publicly from his opinion. In this respect the\r\nBasutos resemble their kinsfolk the Bamangwato, among whom Khama rules\r\nas a chief amenable to public opinion, which, in that instance, is\r\nunfortunately far behind the enlightened purposes of the sovereign.\r\n\r\nNowhere has the gospel made such progress among the Kafirs as in\r\nBasutoland. The missionaries,--French, Protestant, Roman Catholic, and\r\nEnglish Episcopalian,--working not only independently but on very\r\ndifferent lines, have brought nearly fifty thousand natives under\r\nChristian influences, as members or adherents. Not all of these are\r\nbaptised converts--the Franco-Swiss missionaries, by whom far the\r\nlargest part of the work has been done, tell me that baptisms do not\r\nincrease fast; and they are wise in not measuring the worth of their\r\nwork by the number of baptisms. Education is spreading. At the last\r\npublic examinations at the Cape, the French Protestant missionaries sent\r\nup twenty Basuto boys, of whom ten passed in honours, and ten in high\r\nclasses, the standard being the same for whites and blacks. There are\r\nnow one hundred and fifty schools in the country, all but two of which\r\nare conducted by the missionaries.\r\n\r\nStrange waves of sentiment pass over the people, at one time carrying\r\nthem back to paganism, at another inclining them to Christianity--the\r\nfirst sign of the latter tendency being discernible in an increase of\r\nattendance at the mission schools. The women are more backward than the\r\nmen, because they have been kept in subjection, and their intelligence\r\nhas remained only half developed. But their condition is improving; men\r\nnow work with them in the fields, and they demand clothes instead of so\r\nmuch oil, wherewith to smear their bodies. As education becomes more\r\ndiffused, old heathen customs lose their hold, and will probably in\r\nthirty years have disappeared. The belief in ghosts and magic is, of\r\ncourse, still strong. On the top of Thaba Bosiyo we were shown the\r\ngraves of Moshesh and several of his brothers and sons, marked by rude\r\nstones, with the name of each chief on his stone. But we were told that\r\nin reality the bodies of Moshesh and of several of the others are not\r\nhere at all, having been dug up and reinterred more than a mile away\r\nnear the foot of the hill. Were the body under the stone, the ghost,\r\nwhich usually dwells near the body, would be liable to be called up by\r\nnecromancers, and might be compelled to work mischief to the\r\ntribe--mischief which would be serious in proportion to the power the\r\nspirit possessed during life. Considering, however, that nearly all the\r\nancient world held similar beliefs, and that a large part of the modern\r\nworld, even in Europe, still clings to them, the persistence of these\r\ninteresting superstitions need excite no surprise, nor are they\r\nproductive of much practical ill, now that the witch-doctor is no longer\r\npermitted to denounce men to death.\r\n\r\nThe material progress of the people has been aided by the enactment of\r\nstringent laws against the sale of white men's intoxicating liquors,\r\nthough some of the chiefs show but a poor example of obedience to these\r\nlaws, the enforcement of which is rendered difficult by the illicit sale\r\nwhich goes on along the frontiers where Basutoland touches the Free\r\nState and the eastern part of Cape Colony. The old native arts and\r\nindustries decline as European goods become cheaper, and industrial\r\ntraining has now become one of the needs of the people. It is an\r\nencouraging sign that, under the auspices of Lerothodi, a sum of £3,184\r\nsterling was collected from the tribe in 1895-6, for the foundation of\r\nan institution to give such training. The receipts from import duties\r\nhave so much increased that the contribution of £18,000 paid by Cape\r\nColony is now annually reduced by nearly £12,000, and the hut tax, of\r\nten shillings per hut, now easily and promptly collected, amounts to\r\n£23,000 a year, leaving a surplus, out of which £1,300 is paid to the\r\nCape. Basutoland is within the South African Customs Union.\r\n\r\nThese facts are encouraging. They show that, so far, the experiment of\r\nleaving a native race to advance in their own way, under their own\r\nchiefs, but carefully supervised by imperial officers, has proved\r\nsuccessful. A warlike, unstable, and turbulent, although intelligent\r\npeople, while increasing fast in wealth and material comfort, has also\r\nbecome more peaceful and orderly, and by the abandonment of its more\r\nrepulsive customs is passing from savagery to a state of\r\nsemi-civilization. Still the situation has its anxieties. The very\r\nprosperity of the country has drawn into it a larger population than the\r\narable and pastoral land may prove able to support. The Free State\r\npeople are not friendly to it, and many politicians in Cape Colony would\r\nlike to recover it for the Colony, while many white adventurers would\r\nlike to prospect for mines, or to oust the natives from the best lands.\r\nThe natives themselves are armed, and being liable, like all natives, to\r\nsudden fits of unreason, may conceivably be led into disorders which\r\nwould involve a war and the regular conquest of the country. The\r\nfirmness as well as the conciliatory tactfulness which the first\r\nCommissioner, Sir Marshal Clarke, and his successor, the present Acting\r\nCommissioner, have shown, has hitherto averted these dangers, and has\r\ninspired the people with a belief in the good will of the British\r\nGovernment. If the progress of recent years can be maintained for thirty\r\nyears more, the risk of trouble will have almost disappeared, for by\r\nthat time a new generation, unused to war, will have grown up. Whoever\r\nfeels for the native and cares for his future must wish a fair chance\r\nfor the experiment that is now being tried in Basutoland, of letting him\r\ndevelop in his own way, shielded from the rude pressure of the whites.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: The word \"Ba Sot'ho\" is in strictness used for the people,\r\n\"Se Sot'ho\" for the language, \"Le Sot'ho\" for the country: but in\r\nEnglish it is more convenient to apply \"Basuto\" to all three.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Gungunhana however had a sort of council of chiefs and\r\nconfidential advisers which he called together at intervals, and which\r\nbore some resemblance to the Homeric Boule and to the earliest form of\r\nour own Curia Regis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\n_SOME SOUTH AFRICAN QUESTIONS_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nBLACKS AND WHITES\r\n\r\n\r\nEverywhere in South Africa, except in the Witwatersrand and Cape Town,\r\nthe black people greatly outnumber the whites. In the Orange Free State\r\nthey are nearly twice as numerous, in Cape Colony and the Transvaal more\r\nthan thrice as numerous, in Natal ten times as numerous, while in the\r\nother territories, British, German, and Portuguese, the disproportion is\r\nvery much greater, possibly some four or five millions of natives\r\nagainst nine or ten thousand Europeans. The total number of whites south\r\nof the Zambesi hardly reaches 750,000, while that of the blacks is\r\nroughly computed at from six to eight millions. At present, therefore,\r\nso far as numbers go, the country is a black man's country.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that this preponderance of the natives is only natural\r\nin a region by far the larger part of which has been very recently\r\noccupied by Europeans, and that in time immigration and the natural\r\ngrowth of the white element will reduce the disproportion. This\r\nexplanation, however, does not meet the facts. The black race is at\r\npresent increasing at least as rapidly as the white. Unlike those true\r\naborigines of the country, the Hottentots and Bushmen, who withered up\r\nand vanished away before the whites, the Kafirs, themselves apparently\r\nintruders from the North, have held their ground, not only in the\r\nwilder country where they have been unaffected by the European, but in\r\nthe regions where he has conquered and ruled over them. They are more\r\nprolific than the whites, and their increase is not restrained by those\r\nprudential checks which tell upon civilised man, because, wants being\r\nfew, subsistence in a warm climate with abundance of land is easy.\r\nFormerly two powerful forces kept down population:--war, in which no\r\nquarter was given and all the property of the vanquished was captured or\r\ndestroyed, and the murders that went on at the pleasure of the chief,\r\nand usually through the agency of the witch-doctor. Now both these\r\nforces have been removed by the action of European government, which has\r\nstopped war and restrains the caprice of the chiefs. Relieved from these\r\nchecks, the Kafirs of the south coast and of Basutoland, the regions in\r\nwhich observation has been easiest, are multiplying faster than the\r\nwhites, and there is no reason why the same thing should not happen in\r\nother parts of the country. The number of the Fingoes, for instance\r\n(though they are no doubt an exceptionally thrifty and thriving tribe),\r\nis to-day ten times as great as it was fifty or sixty years ago. Here is\r\na fact of serious import for the future. Two races, far removed from one\r\nanother in civilization and mental condition, dwell side by side.\r\nNeither race is likely to extrude or absorb the other. What then will be\r\ntheir relations, and how will the difficulties be met to which their\r\njuxtaposition must give rise?\r\n\r\nThe Colonies of Britain over the world fall into two groups: those which\r\nhave received the gift of self-government, and those which are governed\r\nfrom home through executive officials placed over each of them. Those of\r\nthe latter class, called Crown Colonies, are all (with the insignificant\r\nexceptions of the Falkland Islands and Malta) within the tropics, and\r\nare all peopled chiefly by coloured races,--negroes, Indians, Malays,\r\nPolynesians, or Chinese,--with a small minority of whites. The\r\nself-governing Colonies, on the other hand, are all situated in the\r\ntemperate zone, and are all, with one exception, peopled chiefly by\r\nEuropeans. It is because they have a European population that they have\r\nbeen deemed fit to govern themselves, just as it is because the tropical\r\nColonies have a predominantly coloured population that the supremacy of\r\nthe Colonial Office and its local representatives is acquiesced in as\r\nfit and proper. Every one perceives that representative assemblies based\r\non a democratic franchise, which are capable of governing Canada or\r\nAustralia, would not succeed in the West Indies or Ceylon or Fiji.\r\n\r\nThe one exception to this broad division, the one case of self-governing\r\ncommunities in which the majority of the inhabitants are not of European\r\nstock, is to be found in South Africa. The general difficulty of\r\nadjusting the relations of a higher and a lower race, serious under\r\nevery kind of government, here presents itself in the special form of\r\nthe construction of a political system which, while democratic as\r\nregards one of the races, cannot safely be made democratic as regards\r\nthe other. This difficulty, though new in the British empire, is not new\r\nin the Southern States of America, which have been struggling with it\r\nfor years; and it is instructive to compare the experience of South\r\nAfrica with that through which the Southern States have passed since the\r\nWar of Secession.\r\n\r\nThroughout South Africa--and for this purpose no distinction need be\r\ndrawn between the two British Colonies and the two Boer Republics--the\r\npeople of colour may be divided into two classes: the wild or tribal\r\nnatives, who are, of course, by far the more numerous, and the tame or\r\ndomesticated natives, among whom one may include, though they are not\r\naborigines, but recent incomers, the East Indians of Natal and the\r\nTransvaal, as well as the comparatively few Malays of the Cape.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to deal with the two classes separately, and to\r\nbegin with the semi-civilized or non-tribal natives, who have been for\r\nthe longest period under white influences, and whose present relations\r\nwith the whites indicate what the relations of the races are likely to\r\nbe, for some time to come, in all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe non-tribal people of colour live in the Cape Colony, except the\r\nsouth-eastern parts (called Pondoland and Tembuland), in Natal, in the\r\nOrange Free State, and in the southern parts of the Transvaal. They\r\nconsist of three stocks: (1) the so-called Cape boys, a mixed race\r\nformed by the intermarriage of Hottentots and Malays with the negro\r\nslaves brought in early days from the west coast, plus some small\r\ninfusion of Dutch blood; (2) the Kafirs no longer living in native\r\ncommunities under their chiefs; and (3) the Indian immigrants who\r\n(together with a few Chinese) have recently come into Natal and the\r\nTransvaal, and number about 60,000, not counting in the indentured\r\ncoolies who are to be sent back to India. There are no data for\r\nconjecturing the number of Cape boys and domesticated Kafirs, but it can\r\nhardly exceed 400,000.\r\n\r\nThese coloured people form the substratum of society in all the four\r\nStates above mentioned. Some till the land for themselves, while others\r\nact as herdsmen or labourers for white farmers, or work at trades for\r\nwhite employers. They do the harder and rougher kinds of labour,\r\nespecially of outdoor labour. Let me remind the reader of what has been\r\nincidentally observed before, and must now be insisted on as being the\r\ncapital feature of South African life--the fact that all unskilled work\r\nis done by black people. In many parts of the country the climate is not\r\ntoo hot for men belonging to the north European races to work in the\r\nfields, for the sun's rays are generally tempered by a breeze, the\r\nnights are cool, and the dry air is invigorating. Had South Africa,\r\nlike California or New South Wales, been colonized solely by white men,\r\nit would probably, like those countries, have to-day a white labouring\r\npopulation. But, unluckily, South Africa was colonized in the\r\nseventeenth century, when the importation of negro slaves was deemed the\r\neasiest means of securing cheap and abundant labour. From 1658 onward\r\ntill, in 1834, slavery was abolished by the British Parliament, it was\r\nto slaves that the hardest and humblest kinds of work were allotted. The\r\nwhite people lost the habit of performing manual toil, and acquired the\r\nhabit of despising it. No one would do for himself what he could get a\r\nblack man to do for him. New settlers from Europe fell into the ways of\r\nthe country, which suited their disinclination for physical exertion\r\nunder a sun hotter than their own. Thus, when at last slavery was\r\nabolished, the custom of leaving menial or toilsome work to people of\r\ncolour continued as strong as ever. It is as strong as ever to-day. The\r\nonly considerable exception, that which was furnished by the German\r\ncolonists who were planted in the eastern province after the Crimean War\r\nof 1854, has ceased to be an exception; for the children of those\r\ncolonists have now, for the most part, sold or leased their allotments\r\nto Kafirs, who till the soil less efficiently than the sturdy old\r\nGermans did. The artisans who to-day come from Europe adopt the habits\r\nof the country in a few weeks or months. The English carpenter hires a\r\nnative \"boy\" to carry his bag of tools for him; the English bricklayer\r\nhas a native hodman to hand the bricks to him, which he proceeds to set;\r\nthe Cornish or Australian miner directs the excavation of the seam and\r\nfixes the fuse which explodes the dynamite, but the work with the\r\npickaxe is done by the Kafir. The herdsmen who drive the cattle or tend\r\nthe sheep are Kafirs, acting under the orders of a white. Thus the\r\ncoloured man is indispensable to the white man, and is brought into\r\nconstant relations with him. He is deemed a necessary part of the\r\neconomic machinery of the country, whether for mining or for\r\nmanufacture, for tillage or for ranching.\r\n\r\nBut though the black people form the lowest stratum of society, they are\r\nnot all in a position of personal dependence. A good many Kafirs,\r\nespecially in the eastern province, own the small farms which they till,\r\nand many others are tenants, rendering to their landlord, like the\r\nmétayers of France, a half of the produce by way of rent. Some few\r\nnatives, especially near Cape Town, are even rich, and among the Indians\r\nof Natal a good many have thriven as shopkeepers. There is no reason to\r\nthink that their present exclusion from trades requiring skill will\r\ncontinue. In 1894 there were Kafirs earning from five shillings to seven\r\nshillings and sixpence a day as riveters on an iron bridge then in\r\ncourse of construction. I was informed by a high railway official that\r\nmany of them were quite fit to be drivers or stokers of locomotives,\r\nthough white sentiment (which tolerates them as navvies or platelayers)\r\nmade it inexpedient to place them in such positions. Many work as\r\nservants in stores, and are little more prone to petty thefts than are\r\nEuropeans. They have dropped their old usages and adopted European\r\nhabits, have substituted European clothes for the _kaross_ of the wild\r\nor \"red\" Kafir, have lost their tribal attachments, usually speak Dutch,\r\nor even perhaps English, and to a considerable extent, especially in the\r\nwestern province and in the towns, have become Christians. The Indians\r\nare, of course, Mohammedans or heathens, the Malays (of whom there are\r\nonly about 13,000), Mohammedans. The coloured people travel a good deal\r\nby rail, and are, especially the Kafirs, eager for instruction, which is\r\nprovided for them only in the mission schools. Some will come from great\r\ndistances to get taught, and those who can write are very fond of\r\ncorresponding with one another. Taken as a whole, they are a quiet and\r\norderly people, not given to crimes of violence, and less given (so far\r\nas I could gather) to pilfering than are the negroes of the Southern\r\nStates of America. The stealing of stock from farms has greatly\r\ndiminished. Assaults upon women, such as are frequent in those States,\r\nand have recently caused a hideous epidemic of lynching, are extremely\r\nrare; indeed, I heard of none, save one or two in Natal, where the\r\nnatives are comparatively wild and the whites scattered thinly among\r\nthem. So few Kafirs have yet received a good education, or tried to\r\nenter occupations requiring superior intelligence, that it is hardly\r\npossible to speak confidently of their capacity for the professions or\r\nthe higher kinds of commerce; but judicious observers think they will in\r\ntime show capacity, and tell you that their inferiority to white men\r\nlies less in mere intellectual ability than in power of will and\r\nsteadiness of purpose. They are unstable, improvident, easily\r\ndiscouraged, easily led astray. When the morality of their old life, in\r\nwhich they were ruled by the will of their chief, the opinion of their\r\nfellows, and the traditional customs of the tribe, has been withdrawn\r\nfrom them, it may be long before any new set of principles can gain a\r\nlike hold upon them.\r\n\r\nThat there should be little community of ideas, and by consequence\r\nlittle sympathy, between such a race and the whites is no more than any\r\none would expect who elsewhere in the world has studied the phenomena\r\nwhich mark the contact of dissimilar peoples. But the traveller in South\r\nAfrica is astonished at the strong feeling of dislike and contempt--one\r\nmight almost say of hostility--which the bulk of the whites show to\r\ntheir black neighbours. He asks what can be the cause of it. It is not\r\ndue, as in the Southern States of America, to political resentment, for\r\nthere has been no sudden gift to former slaves of power over former\r\nmasters. Neither is it sufficiently explained by the long conflicts with\r\nthe south-coast Kafirs; for the respect felt for their bravery has\r\ntended to efface the recollection of their cruelties. Neither is it\r\ncaused (except as respects the petty Indian traders) by the dislike of\r\nthe poorer whites to the competition with them in industry of a class\r\nliving in a much ruder way and willing to accept much lower wages. It\r\nseems to spring partly from the old feeling of contempt for the slaves,\r\na feeling which has descended to a generation that has never seen\r\nslavery as an actual system; partly from physical aversion; partly from\r\nan incompatibility of character and temper, which makes the faults of\r\nthe coloured man more offensive to the white than the (perhaps morally\r\nas grave) faults of members of his own white stock. Even between\r\ncivilized peoples, such as Germans and Russians, or Spaniards and\r\nFrenchmen, there is a disposition to be unduly annoyed by traits and\r\nhabits which are not so much culpable in themselves as distasteful to\r\nmen constructed on different lines. This sense of annoyance is naturally\r\nmore intense toward a race so widely removed from the modern European as\r\nthe Kafirs are. Whoever has travelled among people of a race greatly\r\nweaker than his own must have sometimes been conscious of an impatience\r\nor irritation which arises when the native either fails to understand or\r\nneglects to obey the command given. The sense of his superior\r\nintelligence and energy of will produces in the European a sort of\r\ntyrannous spirit, which will not condescend to argue with the native,\r\nbut overbears him by sheer force, and is prone to resort to physical\r\ncoercion. Even just men, who have the deepest theoretical respect for\r\nhuman rights, are apt to be carried away by the consciousness of\r\nsuperior strength, and to become despotic, if not harsh. To escape this\r\nfault, a man must be either a saint or a sluggard. And the tendency to\r\nrace enmity lies very deep in human nature. Perhaps it is a survival\r\nfrom the times when each race could maintain itself only by slaughtering\r\nits rivals.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of contempt I have mentioned may be noted in all classes,\r\nthough it is strongest in those rough and thoughtless whites who plume\r\nthemselves all the more upon their colour because they have little else\r\nto plume themselves upon, while among the more refined it is restrained\r\nby self-respect and by the sense that allowances must be made for a\r\nbackward race. It is stronger among the Dutch than among the English,\r\npartly, perhaps, because the English wish to be unlike the Dutch in this\r\nas in many other respects. Yet one often hears that the Dutch get on\r\nbetter with their black servants than the English do, because they\r\nunderstand native character better, and are more familiar in their\r\nmanners, the Englishman retaining his national stiffness. The laws of\r\nthe Boer Republics are far more harsh than those of the English\r\nColonies, and the Transvaal Boers have been always severe and cruel in\r\ntheir dealings with the natives. But the English also have done so many\r\nthings to be deplored that it does not lie with them to cast stones at\r\nthe Boers, and the mildness of colonial law is largely due to the\r\ninfluence of the home government, and to that recognition of the equal\r\ncivil rights of all subjects which has long pervaded the common law of\r\nEngland. Only two sets of Europeans are free from reproach: the imperial\r\nofficials, who have almost always sought to protect the natives, and the\r\nclergy, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, who have been the truest and\r\nmost constant friends of the Hottentot and the Kafir, sometimes even\r\ncarrying their zeal beyond what discretion could approve.\r\n\r\nDeep and wide-spread as is the sentiment of aversion to the coloured\r\npeople which I am describing, it must not be supposed that the latter\r\nare generally ill-treated. There is indeed a complete social separation.\r\nIntermarriage, though permitted by law in the British Colonies, is\r\nextremely rare, and illicit unions are uncommon. Sometimes the usual\r\nrelations of employer and employed are reversed, and a white man enters\r\nthe service of a prosperous Kafir. This makes no difference as respects\r\ntheir social intercourse, and I remember to have heard of a case in\r\nwhich the white workman stipulated that his employer should address him\r\nas \"boss.\" Black children are very seldom admitted to schools used by\r\nwhite children; indeed, I doubt if the two colours are ever to be seen\r\non the same benches, except at Lovedale and in one or two of the mission\r\nschools in Cape Town, to which, as charging very low fees, some of the\r\npoorest whites send their children. I heard of a wealthy coloured man at\r\nthe Paarl, a Dutch town north of Cape Town, who complained that, though\r\nhe paid a considerable sum in taxes, he was not permitted to send his\r\ndaughter to any of the schools in the place. In the Protestant\r\nEpiscopal, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Methodist Churches, and\r\nof course among the Roman Catholics, blacks are admitted along with\r\nwhites to the sacrament of the Lord's Supper; but this (so I was told)\r\nis not the case in the Dutch Reformed Church. An eminent and thoughtful\r\necclesiastic in Natal deplored to me the complete want of sympathy on\r\nthe part of the white congregations with the black ones worshipping near\r\nthem. It rarely, if ever, happens that a native, whatever his standing\r\namong his own people,--for to the white there is practically no\r\ndifference between one black and another,--is received within a white\r\nman's house on any social occasion; indeed, he would seldom be\r\npermitted, save as a servant, to enter a private house, but would be\r\nreceived on the _stoep_ (veranda). When Khama, the most important chief\r\nnow left south of the Zambesi, a Christian and a man of high personal\r\ncharacter, was in England in 1895, and was entertained at lunch by the\r\nDuke of Westminster and other persons of social eminence, the news of\r\nthe reception given him excited annoyance and disgust among the whites\r\nin South Africa. I was told that at a garden-party given a few years ago\r\nby the wife of a white bishop, the appearance of a native clergyman\r\ncaused many of the white guests to withdraw in dudgeon. Once when\r\nmyself a guest at a mission station in Basutoland I was asked by my host\r\nwhether I had any objection to his inviting to the family meal a native\r\npastor who had been preaching to the native congregation. When I\r\nexpressed surprise at the question, my host explained that race feeling\r\nwas so strong among the colonists that it would be deemed improper, and\r\nindeed insulting, to make a black man sit down at the same table with a\r\nwhite guest, unless the express permission of the latter had been first\r\nobtained. But apart from this social disparagement, the native does not\r\nsuffer much actual wrong. Now and then, on a remote farm, the employer\r\nwill chastise his servant with a harshness he would not venture to apply\r\nto a white boy. A shocking case of the kind occurred a few years ago in\r\nthe eastern province. A white farmer--an Englishman, not a Boer--flogged\r\nhis Kafir servant so severely that the latter died; and when the culprit\r\nwas put on his trial, and acquitted by a white jury, his white\r\nneighbours escorted him home with a band of music. More frequently,\r\nunscrupulous employers, especially on the frontiers of civilization,\r\nwill try to defraud their native workmen, or will provoke them by\r\nill-usage to run away before the day of payment arrives. But there are\r\nno lynchings, as in America, and the white judges and magistrates, if\r\nnot always the juries, administer the law with impartiality.\r\n\r\nAs regards the provisions of the law, one must distinguish between the\r\nBritish Colonies and the Dutch Republics. In the former the ordinary\r\ncivil rights of whites and blacks are precisely the same, though there\r\nexist certain police provisions which are applicable only to the latter.\r\nCape Colony has a so-called \"curfew law,\" requiring natives who are out\r\nof doors after dark to be provided with a pass--a law which is found\r\noppressive by the best class of natives, educated and respectable men,\r\nthough defended as necessary for public order, having regard to the\r\nlarge black population of the lower class, and their propensity to\r\ndrink and petty offences. There are also certain \"labour laws,\" applying\r\nto natives only, and particularly to those on agricultural locations,\r\nwhich are intended to check the disposition of Kafirs living on native\r\nreserves to become idle or to take to vagrancy. Doubtless there is a\r\nrisk that people who have never acquired habits of steady industry--for\r\nthe tribal Kafir leaves to his wives the cultivation of his plot of\r\nmaize or sorghum--may relapse into a laziness hurtful to their own\r\nprogress, seeing that a few weeks' labour is sufficient to provide all\r\nthe food needed for a whole year. In the transition from one state of\r\nsociety to another exceptional legislation is needed, and a _prima\r\nfacie_ case for the so-called \"Glen Grey Act\" and similar laws may,\r\ntherefore, be made out.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the natives whom I consulted on the subject, and one or\r\ntwo of the most educated and representative Kafirs themselves, did not\r\nseem to object to this Act in principle, though they criticized its\r\nmethods and many of its details. But as all such laws are prompted not\r\nonly by regard for the welfare of the Kafir, but also by the desire of\r\nthe white colonist to get plenty of labour and to get it cheap, they are\r\nobviously open to abuse and require great care in their administration.\r\nThe whole subject of native labour and native land tenure is an\r\nintricate and difficult one, which I have not space to discuss here,\r\nthough I obtained a good deal of information regarding it. It is also an\r\nurgent one, for the population which occupies the native reserves is in\r\nsome districts growing so fast that the agricultural land will soon\r\ncease to feed them, while the pasture is suffering from being\r\noverstocked. Most of my informants agreed in thinking that the control\r\nof the British magistrate over the management of lands in reservations\r\nwas better than that of the native headman, and ought to be extended,\r\nand that the tenure of farms by individual natives outside the\r\nreservations ought to be actively encouraged. They deemed this a step\r\nforward in civilization; and they also held that it is necessary to\r\nprevent native allotments, even when held by individuals, from being\r\nsold to white men, conceiving that without such a prohibition the whites\r\nwill in course of time oust the natives from the ownership of all the\r\nbest land.\r\n\r\nOne law specially applicable to natives has been found most valuable in\r\nNatal, as well as in the territories of the Chartered Company, and ought\r\nto be enacted in Cape Colony also, viz., an absolute prohibition of the\r\nsale to them of intoxicating spirits. The spirits made for their\r\nconsumption are rough and fiery, much more deleterious than European\r\nwhisky or brandy or hollands. Unfortunately, the interests of the\r\nwinegrowers and distillers in the Colony have hitherto proved strong\r\nenough to defeat the bills introduced for this purpose by the friends of\r\nthe natives. Though some people maintain that the Dutch and anti-native\r\nparty resist this much-needed measure because they desire through strong\r\ndrink to weaken and keep down the natives, I do not believe in the\r\nexistence of any such diabolical motive. Commercial self-interest, or\r\nrather a foolish and short-sighted view of self-interest,--for in the\r\nlong run the welfare of the natives is also the welfare of the\r\nwhites,--sufficiently accounts for their conduct; but it is a slur on\r\nthe generally judicious policy of the Colonial Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn the two Dutch Republics the English principle of equal civil rights\r\nfor white and black finds no place. One of the motives which induced the\r\nBoers of 1836 to trek out of the Colony was their disgust at the\r\nestablishment of such equality by the British Government. The Grondwet\r\n(fundamental law) of the Transvaal Republic declared, in 1858, and\r\ndeclares to-day, that \"the people will suffer no equality of whites and\r\nblacks, either in state or in church.\"[69] Democratic Republics are not\r\nnecessarily respectful of what used to be called human rights, and\r\nneither the \"principles of 1789\" nor those of the American Declaration\r\nof Independence find recognition among the Boers. Both in the Transvaal\r\nand in the Orange Free State a native is forbidden to hold land, and is\r\nnot permitted to travel anywhere without a pass, in default of which he\r\nmay be detained. (In the Free State, however, the sale of intoxicants to\r\nhim is forbidden, and a somewhat similar law, long demanded by the\r\nmine-owners, has very recently been enacted in the Transvaal.) Nor can a\r\nnative serve on a jury, whereas in Cape Colony he is legally qualified,\r\nand sometimes is empanelled. The whites may object to his presence, but\r\na large-minded and strong-minded judge can manage to overcome their\r\nreluctance. For a good while after they settled in the Transvaal the\r\nBoers had a system of apprenticing Kafir children which was with\r\ndifficulty distinguishable from predial serfdom: and though they have\r\nconstantly denied that they sanctioned either the kidnapping of children\r\nor the treatment of the apprentices as slaves, there is reason to think\r\nthat in some parts of the country these abuses did for a time exist. It\r\nseems clear, however, that no such practices are now legal.\r\n\r\nPolitical rights have, of course, never been held by persons of colour\r\nin either of the Dutch Republics, nor has it ever been proposed to grant\r\nthem. Boer public opinion would scout such an idea, for it reproaches\r\nthe people of Cape Colony now with being \"governed by black men,\"\r\nbecause the electoral franchise is there enjoyed by a few persons of\r\ncolour. In the two Colonies the history of the matter is as follows.\r\nWhen representative government was established, and the electoral\r\nfranchise conferred upon the colonists in 1853, no colour-line was\r\ndrawn; and from that time onward black people have voted, though of\r\ncourse not very many were qualified under the law to vote. Some years\r\nago, however, the whites, and the Dutch party in particular, became\r\nuneasy at the strength of the coloured element, though it did not vote\r\nsolid, had no coloured leaders, and was important only in a very few\r\nconstituencies. Accordingly, an Act was passed in 1892, establishing a\r\ncombined educational and property qualification--that is to say, the\r\nownership of a house or other building of the value of £75 or upwards,\r\nor the being in receipt of a salary of £50 per annum, with the ability\r\nto sign one's name and write one's address and occupation This Act,\r\nwhich did not apply to those already registered in any particular\r\ndistrict and claiming to be re-registered therein, is expected to keep\r\ndown the number of coloured voters; and as it applies to whites also\r\nthere is no inequality of treatment. Tribal Kafirs have, of course,\r\nnever had the franchise at all. Neither the natives--the most\r\nsubstantial and best educated among whom possess the qualifications\r\nrequired--nor their friends complain of this law, which may be defended\r\non the ground that, while admitting those people of colour whose\r\nintelligence fits them for the exercise of political power, it excludes\r\na large mass whose ignorance and indifference to public questions would\r\nmake them the victims of rich and unscrupulous candidates. It is,\r\nperhaps, less open to objection than some of the attempts recently made\r\nin the Southern States of America to evade the provisions of the\r\namendments to the Federal Constitution under which negroes obtained the\r\nsuffrage. In Natal nearly all the Kafirs live under native law, and have\r\nthus been outside the representative system; but the Governor has power\r\nto admit a Kafir to the suffrage, and this has been done in a few\r\ninstances. As stated in Chapter XVIII, the rapid increase of Indian\r\nimmigrants in that Colony alarmed the whites, and led to the passing, in\r\n1896, of an Act which will practically debar these immigrants from\r\npolitical rights, as coming from a country in which no representative\r\ninstitutions exist. Thus Natal also has managed to exclude coloured\r\npeople without making colour the nominal ground of disability. I need\r\nhardly say that whoever has the suffrage is also eligible for election\r\nto the Legislature. No person of colour is now, however, a member of\r\neither chamber in either Colony.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for people in Europe, who have had no experience of the\r\npresence among them of a semi-civilized race, destitute of the ideas and\r\nhabits which lie at the basis of free government, to condemn the action\r\nof these Colonies in seeking to preserve a decisive electoral majority\r\nfor the whites. But any one who has studied the question on the spot,\r\nand especially any one who has seen the evils which in America have\r\nfollowed the grant of the suffrage to persons unfit for it, will form a\r\nmore charitable judgment. It is indeed impolitic to exclude people\r\nmerely on the score of their race. There are among the educated Kafirs\r\nand Indians persons quite as capable as the average man of European\r\nstock, and it is wholesome that the white, too apt to despise his\r\ncoloured neighbour, should be made to feel this, and that the educated\r\ncoloured man should have some weight in the community as an elector, and\r\nshould be entitled to call on his representative to listen to and\r\nexpress the demands he may make on behalf of his own race. As the number\r\nof educated and property-holding natives increases, they will naturally\r\ncome to form a larger element in the electorate, and will be a useful\r\none. But to toss the gift of political power into the lap of a multitude\r\nof persons who are not only ignorant, but in mind children rather than\r\nmen, is not to confer a boon, but to inflict an injury. So far as I\r\ncould judge, this is the view of the most sensible natives in Cape\r\nColony itself, and of the missionaries also, who have been the steadiest\r\nfriends of their race. What is especially desirable is to safeguard the\r\nprivate rights of the native, and to secure for him his due share of the\r\nland, by retaining which he will retain a measure of independence. The\r\nless he is thrown into the whirlpool of party politics the better.\r\n\r\nLet me again repeat that there is at present no serious friction between\r\nthe black and the white people in South Africa. Though the attitude of\r\nmost of the whites--there are, of course, many exceptions--is\r\ncontemptuous, unfriendly, and even suspicious, the black man accepts the\r\nsuperiority of the white as part of the order of nature. He is too low\r\ndown, too completely severed from the white, to feel indignant. Even the\r\nfew educated natives are too well aware of the gulf that divides their\r\nown people from the European to resent, except in specially aggravated\r\ncases, the attitude of the latter. Each race goes its own way and lives\r\nits own life.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the wild or tribal Kafirs can be much more shortly\r\ndescribed, for they have as yet entered into few relations with the\r\nwhites. They are in many different grades of civilisation, from the\r\nBasutos, an industrious and settled population, among whom Christianity\r\nhas made great progress, to the fierce Matabili of the north, and the\r\nTongas of the east coast, who remain complete savages. There are\r\nprobably six millions of Kafirs living under their chiefs south of the\r\nZambesi, many of them entirely unaffected by Europeans, with not even a\r\nwhite magistrate or a native commissioner to collect hut-tax; and\r\nbesides these there are the Korannas (akin to the Bushmen) and Namaquas\r\n(akin to the Hottentots) of the desert country between Bechuanaland and\r\nthe Atlantic. In many of the districts where a regular British or Boer\r\nGovernment has been established, the tribal natives are now settled in\r\nregular locations, where the land is reserved from the intrusion of\r\nEuropeans. Here they live under their chiefs in the old way (see Chapter\r\nX), and in the remoter districts continue to practise their old\r\nceremonies. In Cape Colony and Natal, however, in both of which Colonies\r\nthere are hundreds of thousands of tribal Kafirs, the more offensive of\r\nthese ceremonies are now forbidden by the Government. Nowhere is\r\nanything done for their education, except by the missionaries, who,\r\nhowever, receive some little assistance from the two Colonial\r\nGovernments. The ancient rites and beliefs gradually decay wherever the\r\nwhites come, and, except beyond the Zambesi, intertribal wars and raids\r\nhave now practically ceased. Yet the tribal hatreds survive. Not long\r\nago the Zulus and the Kosa Kafirs employed as platelayers on the Cape\r\nGovernment Railway fought fiercely with each other. One powerful\r\ninfluence is telling upon them, even where they live uncontrolled by any\r\nwhite government. The diamond-mines at Kimberley, the gold-mines in the\r\nWitwatersrand and in various parts of Mashonaland and Matabililand,\r\noffer large wages for native labour, and cannot (except at Kimberley)\r\nobtain as much native labour as they need. Accordingly a steady though\r\nstill insufficient stream of Kafirs sets towards these mining centres,\r\nnot only from Basutoland, Natal, and Bechuanaland, but also from the\r\nPortuguese territories, where the Shangans live, and from the banks of\r\nthe Zambesi. Most of the workmen remain for a few weeks or months only,\r\nand return home when they have earned as much money as will purchase two\r\noxen, heretofore the usual price of a wife. They are paid in English\r\ncoin, and thus the English twenty-shilling gold piece has become known,\r\nand to-day passes current in villages where no white man has yet been\r\nseen, even beyond the Zambesi, on the shores of Lake Bangweolo. With the\r\nuse of coin there will come in time a desire for European goods, which,\r\nin its turn, will draw more labour toward the mines, and perhaps at\r\nlast create even among the home-keeping Kafirs a disposition to till the\r\nland or raise cattle for sale. The destruction of cattle by the murrain\r\nwhich has been raging over the country may accelerate this change.\r\nAlready wandering traders and gold-prospectors traverse regions beyond\r\nthe border of civilization; and to keep these people, who are often\r\nreckless and lawless, from injuring the natives and provoking them to\r\ntake vengeance on the next white man who comes their way, is one of the\r\ngreatest difficulties of the British Government, a difficulty aggravated\r\nby the absence in nearly all cases of sufficient legal evidence--for all\r\nover South Africa native evidence is seldom received against a white\r\nman. The regions in which white influence is now most active, and which\r\nwill most quickly become assimilated to the two British Colonies, are\r\nthose through which railways have been or are now being\r\nconstructed--Bechuanaland, Matabililand, and Mashonaland. Should the\r\nmines in these countries turn out well, and means be found for replacing\r\nby new stock the cattle that have perished, these regions may in fifteen\r\nor twenty years possess a considerable population of non-tribal and\r\nsemi-civilised natives. Within the next half-century it is probable\r\nthat, at least in the British territories as far as the Zambesi, as well\r\nas in the Transvaal and Swaziland, the power of the chiefs will have\r\npractically vanished and the natives be in a position similar to that\r\nwhich they now hold in Natal and the greater part of Cape Colony; that\r\nis to say, they will either dwell among the whites under the ordinary\r\nlaw, or will be occupying reservations under the control of a European\r\nmagistrate, their old land customs having been mostly superseded and\r\ntheir heathen rites forbidden or disused.\r\n\r\nThe position which the whites and the blacks hold toward one another in\r\nSouth Africa is sufficiently similar to that of the two races in the\r\nSouthern States of America to make a short comparison between the two\r\ncases instructive. There are no doubt many differences. In the United\r\nStates the Southern negroes are strangers and therefore isolated, with\r\nno such reserve of black people behind them as the Kafirs have in the\r\nrest of the African continent. In South Africa it is the whites who are\r\nnew-comers and isolated, and they are numerically inferior to the\r\nblacks, not, as in America, in a few particular areas (the three States\r\nof South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana), but all over the\r\ncountry. In the whole United States the whites are to the blacks as ten\r\nto one; in Africa south of the Zambesi it is the blacks who are ten to\r\none to the whites. Or if we compare the four South African Colonies and\r\nRepublics with the fifteen old slave States, the blacks are in the\r\nformer nearly four times as numerous as the whites, and the whites in\r\nthe latter twice as numerous as the blacks. In point of natural capacity\r\nand force of character the Bantu races are at least equal, probably\r\nsuperior, to the negroes brought from Africa to North America, most of\r\nwhom seem to have come from the Guinea coasts. But in point of education\r\nand in habits of industry the American negroes are far ahead of the\r\nSouth African; for the latter have not been subjected to the industrial\r\ntraining of nearly two centuries of plantation life or domestic service,\r\nwhile comparatively few have had any industrial contact with white\r\nworkmen, or any stimulation like that which the grant of the suffrage\r\nafter the War of Secession has exercised upon a large section of the\r\nAmerican negroes, even in places where they have not been permitted to\r\nturn their legal rights to practical account. The American negroes are,\r\nmoreover, all nominally Christians; the South African Kafirs nearly all\r\nheathens. Yet, after allowing for these and other minor points of\r\ncontrast, the broad fact remains that in both countries we see two races\r\nin very different stages of civilisation dwelling side by side, yet not\r\nmingling nor likely to mingle. In both countries one race rules over\r\nthe other. The stronger despises and dislikes the weaker; the weaker\r\nsubmits patiently to the stronger. But the weaker makes in education and\r\nin property a progress which will some day bring it much nearer to the\r\nstronger than it is now.\r\n\r\nThe social and political troubles which the juxtaposition of the two\r\nraces has caused in North America, and which have induced many Americans\r\nto wish that it were possible to transport the whole seven millions of\r\nSouthern negroes back to the Niger or the Congo, have as yet scarcely\r\nshown themselves in South Africa. Neither in the British Colonies nor in\r\nthe Boer Republics is there any cause for present apprehension. The\r\ncoloured people are submissive and not resentful. They have, moreover, a\r\ncertain number of friends and advocates in the legislatures of the\r\nColonies, and a certain amount of public opinion, the opinion of the\r\nbest part of the community, disposed to protect them. Nevertheless, no\r\ntraveller can study the colour problem in South Africa without\r\nanxiety--anxiety, not for the present, but for the future, a future in\r\nwhich the seeds that are now being sown will have sprung up and grown to\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nWhat is the future of the Kafirs likely to be? Though a writer may\r\nprophesy with an easy mind when he knows that the truth or error of the\r\nprophecy will not be tested till long after he has himself quitted the\r\nworld, still it is right to make the usual apologies for venturing to\r\nprophesy at all. These apologies being taken as made, let us consider\r\nwhat is likely to come to pass in South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Kafirs will stay where they are and form the bulk of the population\r\nall over South Africa. Some sanguine men think they will move off to the\r\nhotter north, as in America the centre of negro population has shifted\r\nsouthward toward the Gulf of Mexico. This is improbable, because the\r\nSouth African white seems resolved to rely upon natives for all the\r\nharder and rougher kinds of labour, not to add that, although the\r\nEuropean can thrive and work, the Kafir is more truly the child of the\r\nsoil and of the climate. And not only will he stay, but, to all\r\nappearances, he will increase faster than does the white man.\r\n\r\nThe Kafirs, now divided into many tribes and speaking many languages and\r\ndialects, will lose their present tribal organization, their languages,\r\ntheir distinctive habits. Whether some sort of native _lingua Franca_\r\nwill spring up, or whether they will all come to speak English, is\r\ndoubtful; but probably in the long run English will prevail and become\r\nthe common speech of the southern half of the continent. They will also\r\nlose their heathenism (though many superstitions will survive), and will\r\nbecome, in name at least, Christians. Thus they will form to a far\r\ngreater extent than now a homogeneous mass pervaded by the same ideas\r\nand customs.\r\n\r\nWhile thus constituting one vast black community, they will probably\r\nremain as sharply marked off from the whites as they are to-day. That\r\nthere will be no intermarriage may safely be assumed from the fact that\r\nmixture of blood has greatly diminished since the days of slavery, just\r\nas it has diminished in the Southern States of America. White opinion\r\nuniversally condemns it, and rightly, for as things are now the white\r\nrace would lose more by the admixture than the coloured race would gain.\r\n\r\nThe Kafirs will be far more generally educated than they are now, and\r\nwill have developed a much higher intelligence. That they will remain\r\ninferior to the whites in all intellectual pursuits and in most\r\nhandicrafts may be concluded from American experience; but they will\r\ndoubtless be able to compete with white men in many trades, will to some\r\nextent enter the professions, will acquire property, and (assuming the\r\nlaw to remain as at present) will form a much larger part, though\r\nprobably for a very long time a minority, of the electorate. From among\r\nthem there will doubtless arise men fit to lead them for social and\r\npolitical purposes. A talent for public speaking is already remarked as\r\none of their gifts.\r\n\r\nThus the day will arrive when South Africa will see itself filled by a\r\nlarge coloured population, tolerably homogeneous, using the same\r\nlanguage, having forgotten its ancient tribal feuds, and not, like the\r\npeople of India, divided by caste or by the mutual hatred of Hindus and\r\nMussulmans. Most of this population will be poor, and it may, unless\r\nsuccessive Colonies are led off to the more thinly peopled parts of\r\nAfrica, tread hard upon the means of subsistence which the land offers;\r\nI say the land, for the mines--or at least the gold-mines--will have\r\nbeen exhausted long before the day we are contemplating arrives.\r\n\r\nWhen will that day arrive? Probably not for at least a century, possibly\r\nnot for two centuries. Fast as the world moves in our time, it must take\r\nseveral generations to develop a race so backward as the Kafirs. Many\r\npolitical changes may occur before then; but political changes are not\r\nlikely to make much difference to a process like this, which goes on\r\nunder natural laws--laws that will continue to work, whatever may happen\r\nto the Boers, and whatever may be the future relations of the Colonies\r\nto the mother country. It is only some great change in human thought and\r\nfeeling, or some undreamt-of discovery in the physical world, that can\r\nbe imagined as likely to affect the progress of the natives and the\r\nattitude of the whites toward them.\r\n\r\nWhen, perhaps in the twenty-first century, the native population has\r\nreached the point of progress we have been imagining, the position may\r\nbe for both races a grave or even a perilous one, if the feeling and\r\nbehaviour of the whites continue to be what they are now. The present\r\ncontented acquiescence of the coloured people in the dominance of the\r\nwhites, and the absence of resentment at the contempt displayed toward\r\nthem, cannot be expected from a people whose inferiority, though still\r\nreal, will be much less palpable. And if trouble comes, the\r\npreponderance of numbers on the black side may make it more serious than\r\nit could be in the United States, where the Southern whites are the\r\noutmost fringe of an enormous white nation. These anxieties are little\r\nfelt, these problems are little canvassed, in South Africa, for things\r\nwhich will not happen in our time or in the time of our children are for\r\nmost of us as though they would never happen; and we have become so\r\naccustomed to see the unexpected come to pass as to forget that where\r\nundoubted natural causes are at work--causes whose working history has\r\nexamined and verified--a result may be practically certain, uncertain as\r\nmay be the time when and the precise form in which it will arrive.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some thoughtful men in the Colonies who see the\r\nmagnitude of the issues involved in this native problem. They hold, so\r\nfar as I could gather their views, that the three chief things to be\r\ndone now are to save the natives from intoxicating liquor, which injures\r\nthem even more than it does the whites, to enact good land laws, which\r\nshall keep them from flocking as a loafing proletariate into the towns,\r\nas well as just labour laws, and to give them much better opportunities\r\nthan they now have of industrial education. Manual training and the\r\nhabit of steady industry are quite as much needed as book education, a\r\nconclusion at which the friends of the American negro have also arrived.\r\nBeyond this the main thing to be done seems to be to soften the feelings\r\nof the average white and to mend his manners. At present he considers\r\nthe native to exist solely for his own benefit. He is harsh or gentle\r\naccording to his own temper; but whether harsh or gentle, he is apt to\r\nthink of the black man much as he thinks of an ox, and to ignore a\r\nnative's rights when they are inconvenient to himself.\r\n\r\nCould he be got to feel more kindly toward the native, and to treat him,\r\nif not as an equal, which he is not, yet as a child, the social aspect\r\nof the problem--and it is the not least serious aspect--would be\r\ncompletely altered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: The Boers are a genuinely religious people, but they have\r\nforgotten 1 Cor. xii. 13, Gal. iii. 28, and Col. iii. 11. Many nations\r\nhave been inspired by the Old Testament, but few indeed are the\r\ninstances in which any has paid regard to the New.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nMISSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strength and vitality of a race, and its power of holding its own in\r\nthe world, depend less on the quickness of its intelligence than on the\r\nsolidity of its character. Its character depends upon the moral ideas\r\nwhich govern its life, and on the habits in which those ideas take\r\nshape; and these, in their turn, depend very largely upon the\r\nconceptions which the race has formed of religion, and on the influence\r\nthat religion has over it. This is especially true of peoples in the\r\nearlier stages of civilization. Their social virtues, the beliefs and\r\nprinciples which hold them together and influence their conduct, rest\r\nupon and are shaped by their beliefs regarding the invisible world and\r\nits forces. Races in which religious ideas are vague and feeble seldom\r\nattain to a vigorous national life, because they want one of the most\r\neffective bonds of cohesion and some of the strongest motives that rule\r\nconduct. It may doubtless be said that the religion of a people is as\r\nmuch an effect as a cause, or, in other words, that the finer or poorer\r\nquality of a race is seen in the sort of religion it makes for itself,\r\nthe higher races producing nobler religious ideas and more impressive\r\nmythologies, just as they produce richer and more expressive languages.\r\nNevertheless, it remains true that a religion, once formed, becomes a\r\npotent factor in the future strength and progress of a people. Now the\r\nreligious ideas of the Bantu races, as of other negroes, have been\r\nscanty, poor, and unfruitful. And accordingly, one cannot meditate upon\r\ntheir condition and endeavour to forecast their progress without giving\r\nsome thought to the influence which better ideas, and especially those\r\nembodied in Christianity, may have upon them.\r\n\r\nNeither the Kafirs nor the Hottentots have had a religion in our sense\r\nof the word. They had no deities, no priesthood, no regular forms of\r\nworship. They were, when Europeans discovered them, still in the stage\r\nin which most, if not all, primitive races would seem to have once\r\nbeen--that of fearing and seeking to propitiate nature spirits and the\r\nghosts of the dead, a form of superstition in which there was scarcely a\r\ntrace of morality. Hence the first task of the missionaries who came\r\namong them was to create a religious sense, to give them the conception\r\nof an omnipotent spiritual power outside natural objects and above man,\r\nand to make them regard this power as the source of moral ideas and the\r\nauthor of moral commands. To do this has been a difficult task.\r\n\r\nBesides this constructive work, which was less needed in some other more\r\nadvanced heathen races, the missionaries had also a destructive work to\r\ndo. Though the Kafirs had no religion, they had a multitude of\r\nsuperstitious rites and usages closely intertwined with the whole of\r\ntheir life and with what one may call their political system. These\r\nusages were so repugnant to Christian morality, and often to common\r\ndecency, that it became necessary to attack them and to require the\r\nconvert to renounce them altogether. Renunciation, however, meant a\r\nseverance from the life of the tribe, contempt and displeasure from the\r\ntribesmen, and possibly the loss of tribal rights. These were evils\r\nwhich it required courage and conviction to face, nor had the missionary\r\nany temporal benefits to offer by way of compensation. There was,\r\nhowever, very little direct persecution, because there were no gods who\r\nwould be incensed, and the witch-doctors were less formidable opponents\r\nthan a regular priesthood would have been. The chiefs were often\r\nfriendly, for they recognized the value of missionary knowledge and\r\ncounsel. Even the ferocious Mosilikatze showed kindness to Robert\r\nMoffat, and Livingstone complained far more of the Boers than he ever\r\ndid of Kafir enemies. Lo Bengula protected the missionaries: Gungunhana\r\nlistened, and made his chiefs listen, to their discourses, though his\r\nnearest approach to conversion was his expression of detestation for\r\nJudas Iscariot. But it rarely befell that a chief himself accepted\r\nChristianity, which would have meant, among other things, the departure\r\nof all his wives but one, and possibly the loss of his hold upon his\r\ntribe. All these things being considered, it need excite no surprise\r\nthat the Gospel should have made comparatively little progress among the\r\nwild or tribal Kafirs.\r\n\r\nIt has been preached to them for nearly a century, by German (chiefly, I\r\nthink, Moravian) and French, as well as by English, Scottish, and\r\nAmerican missionaries. At present there are not a few British societies\r\nand denominations in the field. The French Protestants have done some\r\nexcellent work, especially in Basutoland, and have also stations near\r\nthe east coast and on the Upper Zambesi. There are also French Roman\r\nCatholic missions, mostly in the hands of Jesuit fathers, many of whom\r\nare men of learning and ability. Between the Roman Catholics, the\r\nProtestant Episcopalians (Church of England), and the missionaries of\r\nthe English Nonconformists and Scottish or French Presbyterians there is\r\nlittle intercourse and no co-operation. Here, as in other mission\r\nfields, this absence of intercourse and sympathy puzzles the native. I\r\nwas told of an English (Protestant Episcopal) clergyman who made it one\r\nof his prime objects to warn the Kafirs against attending the services\r\nof the French Protestant missionaries, whom he apparently regarded as\r\noutside the pale of the true Church. In the Boer Republics there are\r\nfewer missions in proportion to the number of natives than in British\r\nterritories; but no district, except the deserts of the west, seems to\r\nbe wholly unprovided for, and in some cases stations have been pushed\r\nfar beyond the limits of European administration, as, for instance,\r\namong the Barotse, who dwell north of the Upper Zambesi. The native\r\ncongregations are usually small, and the careers of the converts not\r\nalways satisfactory. This is so natural that it is odd to find\r\nEuropeans, and most conspicuously those whose own life is not a model of\r\nChristian morality, continually growling and sneering at the\r\nmissionaries because their converts do not all turn out saints. The\r\nsavage is unstable in character, and baptism does not necessarily\r\nextinguish either his old habits or the hold which native superstitions\r\nhave upon him. It is in this instability of his will, and his proneness\r\nto yield to drink or some other temptation, rather than in his\r\nintellect, that the weakness of the savage lies. And a man with hundreds\r\nof generations of savagery behind him is still, and must be, in many\r\nrespects a savage, even though he reads and writes, and wears European\r\nclothes, and possibly even a white necktie. The Kafirs are not such bad\r\nChristians as the Frankish warriors were for two or three generations\r\nafter the conversion of Clovis. We must wait for several generations\r\nbefore we can judge fairly of the influence of his new religion upon the\r\nmind of a Kafir whose ancestors had no religion at all, and were ruled\r\nby the lowest forms of superstition.\r\n\r\nThese facts are better recognized by the missionaries to-day than they\r\nwere sixty years ago, and they have in consequence made some changes in\r\ntheir methods. They are no longer so anxious to baptize, or so apt to\r\nreckon success by the number of their converts. They are more cautious\r\nin ordaining native pastors. The aid of such pastors is indispensable,\r\nbut the importance of the example which the native preacher or teacher\r\nsets makes it necessary to be careful in selection. The dogma of the\r\nequality of the black man and the white, which was warmly insisted on in\r\nthe old days, and often roused the wrath of the Boers, has now been\r\nsilently dropped. It was a dogma wholesome to inculcate so far as\r\nequality of protection was concerned, but its wider application led the\r\nearly philanthropists of South Africa, as it led their excellent\r\ncontemporaries, the Abolitionists of America, to some strange\r\nconclusions. Perceiving that other influences ought to go hand in hand\r\nwith religion in helping the natives forward, the missionaries now\r\ndevote themselves more than formerly to secular instruction, and\r\nendeavour to train the people to habits of industry. The work of\r\neducation is indeed entirely in their hands. Special mention is due to\r\none admirable institution, that which was founded by the Free Church of\r\nScotland at Lovedale, in the Eastern Province, not far from King\r\nWilliam's Town, nearly fifty years ago. Conducted on wholly\r\nnon-sectarian lines, it receives coloured people, together with some\r\nwhites, not only from the Colony, but from all parts of Africa--there\r\nare even Galla boys from the borders of Abyssinia in it--and gives an\r\nexcellent education, fitting young men and women not only for the native\r\nministry, but for the professions: and it is admitted even by those who\r\nare least friendly to missionary work to have rendered immense services\r\nto the natives. I visited it, and was greatly struck by the tone and\r\nspirit which seemed to pervade it, a spirit whose results are seen in\r\nthe character and careers of many among its graduates. A race in the\r\npresent condition of the Kafirs needs nothing more than the creation of\r\na body of intelligent and educated persons of its own blood, who are\r\nable to enter into the difficulties of their humbler kinsfolk and guide\r\nthem wisely. Dr. Stewart, who has directed the institution for many\r\nyears, possesses that best kind of missionary temperament, in which a\r\nhopeful spirit and an inexhaustible sympathy are balanced by Scottish\r\nshrewdness and a cool judgment.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest among the difficulties which confront the\r\nmissionaries is to know how to deal with polygamy, a practice deeply\r\nrooted in Kafir life. A visitor from Europe is at first surprised to\r\nfind how seriously they regard it, and asks whether the example of the\r\nworthies of the Old Testament does not make it hard for them to refuse\r\nbaptism to the native who seeks it, though he has more than one wife.\r\nThe clergy of the Church of England, however, and those of the French\r\nProtestant Church--and I think other missionaries also--are unanimous in\r\nholding that, although they may properly admit a polygamist as a\r\ncatechumen, they should not baptize such a one; and they say that the\r\nnative pastors hold this view even more strongly than they do\r\nthemselves. Polygamy is so bound up with heathen customs, and exerts, in\r\ntheir view, so entirely baneful an influence upon native society, that\r\nit must be at all hazards resisted and condemned.[70] One is reminded of\r\nthe Neoplatonic philosophers, the last professors of the Platonic\r\nacademy at Athens, who in the sixth century of our era sought an asylum\r\nfrom Christian persecution at the court of Chosroes Anurshirwan, in\r\nPersia. They forced themselves to tolerate the other usages of the\r\npeople among whom they came, but polygamy was too much for them, and\r\nrather than dwell among those who practised it, they returned to the\r\nunfriendly soil of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries, and especially those of the London Missionary Society,\r\nplayed at one time a much more prominent part in politics than they now\r\nsustain. Within and on the borders of Cape Colony they were, for the\r\nfirst sixty years of the present century, the leading champions of the\r\nnatives, and as they enjoyed the support of an active body of opinion in\r\nEngland and Scotland, they had much influence in Parliament and with the\r\nColonial Office. Outside the Colony they were often the principal\r\nadvisers of the native chiefs (as their brethren were at the same time\r\nin the islands of the Pacific), and held a place not unlike that of the\r\nbishops in Gaul in the fifth century of our era. Since, in advocating\r\nthe cause of the natives, they had often to complain of the behaviour of\r\nthe whites, and since, whenever a chief came into collision with the\r\nemigrant Boers or with colonial frontiersmen, they became the channel by\r\nwhich the chief stated his case to the British Government, they incurred\r\nthe bitter hostility of the emigrant Boers and some dislike even in the\r\nColony. To this old cause much of the unpopularity that still attaches\r\nto them seems due. Unpopular they certainly are. They are reproached\r\nwith the paucity of their converts, and that by white men whose own\r\ntreatment of the Kafirs might well make the white man's religion odious\r\nto a native. They are also accused of abusing their position to enrich\r\nthemselves by trade with the Kafirs. This abuse has sometimes occurred,\r\nand clearly ought to be checked by the home societies. But probably it\r\ndoes not disgust the wandering white trader any more than the fact that\r\nthe missionary often warns the native against the exorbitant prices\r\nwhich the trader demands for his goods. They are blamed for making the\r\nconverted Kafir uppish, and telling him that he is as good as a white\r\nman, an offence which has no doubt been often committed. A graver\r\nallegation, to which Mr. Theal has given some countenance in his\r\nhistorical writings, is that they used to bring groundless or\r\nexaggerated charges against the Boer farmers, and always sided with the\r\nnatives, whatever the merits of the case. I do not venture to pronounce\r\non the truth of this allegation, which it would take much time and\r\nlabour to sift. As there have been some few missionaries whose\r\ndemeanour was not creditable to their profession, so there have\r\ndoubtless been instances in which partisan ardour betrayed them into\r\nexaggerations. But whosoever remembers that but for the missionaries the\r\nnatives would have lacked all local protection, and that it was only\r\nthrough the missionaries that news of injustice or cruelty practised on\r\na native could reach the ears of the British Government, will look\r\nleniently on the errors of honest zeal, and will rejoice that ministers\r\nof religion were found to champion the cause of the weaker race and keep\r\nthe home Government alive to a sense of one of its first duties.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the slowness of the progress hitherto made, the\r\nextinction of heathenism in South Africa may be deemed certain, and\r\ncertain at no distant date. There is here no ancient and highly\r\norganized system of beliefs and doctrines, such as Hinduism and Islam\r\nare in India, to resist the solvent power which European civilisation\r\nexerts. In forty years there will probably be no more pagan rites\r\npractised in Cape Colony. In eighty years there will be none in\r\nMatabililand, or perhaps even sooner, if the gold-reefs turn out well;\r\nfor though a mining-camp is not a school of Christianity, it is a\r\ndestroyer of paganism. Already I found, in traversing Mashonaland, that\r\nthe poor ghosts were ceasing to receive their wonted offerings of native\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\nWhat will happen when heathenism and the tribal system have vanished\r\naway? Such morality, such principles of manly conduct as the natives now\r\nhave, are bound up with their ghost-worship and still more with their\r\ntribal system, which prescribes loyalty to the chief, courage in war,\r\ndevotion to the interests of the tribe or clan. When these principles\r\nhave disappeared along with the tribal organization, some other\r\nprinciples, some other standard of duty and precepts of conduct, ought\r\nto be at hand to replace them. Where are such precepts to be found, and\r\nwhence are the motives and emotions to be drawn which will give the new\r\nprecepts a power to command the will? Although the Kafirs have shown\r\nrather less aptitude for assimilating Christian teaching than some other\r\nsavage races have done, there is nothing in the experience of the\r\nmissions to discourage the hope that such teaching may come to prevail\r\namong them, and that through it each generation may show a slight moral\r\nadvance upon that which has gone before. As the profession of\r\nChristianity will create a certain link between the Kafirs and their\r\nrulers which may soften the asperity which the relations of the two\r\nraces now wear, so its doctrines will in time give them a standard of\r\nconduct similar to that accepted among the whites, and an ideal which\r\nwill influence the superior minds among them. So much may certainly be\r\nsaid: that the Gospel and the mission schools are at present the most\r\ntruly civilizing influences which work upon the natives, and that upon\r\nthese influences, more than on any other agency, does the progress of\r\nthe coloured race depend.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: After listening to their arguments, I did not venture to\r\ndoubt that they were right.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nSOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TWO BRITISH COLONIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two South African Colonies have not yet had time to develop new and\r\ndistinctive types of life and character. Though Cape Colony is nearly as\r\nold as Massachusetts or Virginia, it has been less than a century under\r\nBritish rule, and the two diverse elements in its population have not\r\nyet become blent into any one type that can be said to belong to the\r\npeople as a whole. One must therefore describe these elements\r\nseparately. The Dutch are almost all country folk, and the country folk\r\nare (in Cape Colony) mostly Dutch. Some, especially near Cape Town, are\r\nagriculturists, but many more are ranchmen or sheep-masters. They are a\r\nslow, quiet, well-meaning hospitable people, extremely conservative in\r\ntheir opinions as well as their habits, very sparing, because they have\r\nlittle ready money, very suspicious, because afraid of being out-witted\r\nby the English traders, and many of them so old-fashioned in their\r\ntheory of the universe as to object to legislation against sheep scab,\r\nbecause they regard it as a visitation of Providence, to be combated\r\nonly by repentance and not by ordinary human means. The women are\r\nusually ill-educated and often unattractive; but they have strong\r\ncharacters. Nothing was more remarkable in the wars of the emigrant\r\nBoers against the Kafirs than the courage and devotion which the women\r\ndisplayed. That love of cleanliness for which their kinsfolk in Holland\r\nare famous has vanished under the conditions of a settler's life and the\r\npractice of using negro servants, and they are now apt to be slatternly.\r\nThese country folk live in a simple, old-fashioned way, loving solitude\r\nand isolation, yet very hospitable, and enjoying the rare occasions on\r\nwhich they meet for festivities at one another's farmhouses. Such\r\nmeetings are almost their only recreations, for hunting is less\r\nattainable now that the larger game has disappeared, and they care\r\nnothing for the intellectual pleasures of reading or art or music.\r\nEducation is beginning to spread among them, but it has not yet done\r\nmuch to quicken their minds or give them new interests. The population\r\nis so extremely thin, the towns so few and so small, that it is not\r\nsurprising that a people who came out from the least educated strata of\r\nsociety in Holland should, under the difficult conditions of a settler's\r\nlife, have remained at a low level of mental culture. They would\r\nprobably have been still more backward, and have produced fewer men of\r\nability, but for the infusion of French Huguenot blood, which still\r\nproclaims itself in the names of some of the leading families.\r\n\r\nCompared to the Dutch, the English are recent immigrants. They have all\r\narrived within the present century, and few of them can point to\r\ngrandfathers born in South Africa. Partly for this reason, partly from\r\ntheir desire to be unlike the Dutch, they have remained markedly\r\nEnglish, both in their speech, in their ideas, and, so far as the\r\ndifferences of climate permit, in their way of life. Nevertheless, they\r\nhave been affected by the Dutch. They have taken from the latter the\r\naversion to field labour, the contempt for the blacks, the tendency to\r\nprefer large pastoral farms to agriculture, and, in some districts, a\r\nrather sleepy and easy-going temperament. Even in Mashonaland I was told\r\nthat the English ranchmen were apt to fall into the habits of their\r\nBoer neighbours. They form the large majority of the town population,\r\nfor not only the seaports, but also such inland places as Graham's Town,\r\nKing William's Town, and Kimberley are quite English, and nearly all the\r\ncommerce and finance of the country are in their hands. They have more\r\nenterprise than the Dutch, and are much less antiquated in their ideas,\r\nso it is to them that the profits of the new mining ventures have\r\nchiefly fallen, so far as these have not been appropriated by keener and\r\nmore ingenious adventurers from Europe, mostly of Semitic stock.\r\n\r\nThere has been hardly any Irish immigration; and though one meets many\r\nScotchmen among the bankers and merchants, the Scottish element seems\r\nsmaller than in Ontario or most of the Australasian Colonies. Many\r\nsettlers have come from Germany, but these have now become blended with\r\nthe English. There are no better colonists than the Germans; and indeed\r\nthe Europeans whom the last ninety years have brought have been mostly\r\nof excellent stocks, superior to the mid-European races that have lately\r\ninundated the United States.\r\n\r\nThough the English and the Dutch form distinct social elements which are\r\nnot yet fused, and though these elements are now politically opposed,\r\nthere is no social antagonism between the races. The Englishman will\r\nderide the slowness of the Dutchman, the Dutchman may distrust the\r\nadroitness or fear the activity of the Englishman, but neither dislikes\r\nnor avoids the other. Neither enjoys, or even pretends to, any social\r\nsuperiority, and hence neither objects to marry his son or his daughter\r\nto a member of the other race. Both are, as a rule, in fairly easy\r\ncircumstances; that is to say, nearly everybody has enough, and till\r\nlately hardly anybody had more than enough. Within the last few years,\r\nhowever, two changes have come. The diamond mines and the gold-mines\r\nhave given vast riches to a small number of persons, some half-dozen or\r\nless of whom continue to live in the Colony, while the others have\r\nreturned to Europe. These great fortunes are a disturbing element,\r\ngiving an undue influence to their possessors, and exciting the envy or\r\nemulation of the multitude. The other change is the growth of a class of\r\npeople resembling the \"mean whites\" of the Southern States of America,\r\nloafers and other lazy or shiftless fellows who hang about and will not\r\ntake to any regular work. I heard them described and deplored as a new\r\nphenomenon, but gather that they are not yet numerous. Their appearance,\r\nit is to be feared, is the natural result of that contempt for hard\r\nunskilled labour which the existence of slavery inspired in the whites;\r\nand they may hereafter constitute, as they now do in the Southern States\r\nof America, the section of the population specially hostile to the\r\nnegro, and therefore dangerous to the whole community.\r\n\r\nTo an Englishman or American who knows how rapidly his language has\r\nbecome the language of commerce over the world; how it has almost\r\nextinguished the ancient Celtic tongues in Scotland and Ireland; how\r\nquickly in the United States it has driven Spanish out of the South\r\nWest, and has come to be spoken by the German, Scandinavian, and\r\nSlavonic immigrants whom that country receives, it is surprising to find\r\nthat Dutch holds its ground stubbornly in South Africa. It is still the\r\nordinary language of probably one-half of the people of Cape Colony\r\n(although most of these can speak some English) and of three-fourths of\r\nthose in the Orange Free State, though of a minority in Natal.\r\nEnglishmen settling in the interior usually learn it for the sake of\r\ntalking to their Dutch neighbours, who are slow to learn English; and\r\nEnglish children learn it from the coloured people, for the coloured\r\npeople talk it far more generally than they do English; in fact, when a\r\nnative (except in one of the coast towns) speaks a European tongue, that\r\ntongue is sure to be Dutch. Good observers told me that although an\r\nincreasing number of the Africanders (_i.e._, colonists born in Africa)\r\nof Dutch origin now understand English, the hold of Dutch is so strong\r\nthat it will probably continue to be spoken in the Colony for two\r\ngenerations at least. Though one must call it Dutch, it differs widely\r\nfrom the cultivated Dutch of Holland, having not only preserved some\r\nfeatures of that language as spoken two centuries ago, but having\r\nadopted many Kafir or Hottentot words, and having become vulgarized into\r\na dialect called the Taal, which is almost incapable of expressing\r\nabstract thought or being a vehicle for any ideas beyond those of daily\r\nlife. In fact, many of the Boers, especially in the Transvaal, cannot\r\nunderstand a modern Dutch book, hardly even an Amsterdam newspaper. This\r\ndefect might give English a great advantage if the Boers wished to\r\nexpress abstract ideas. But they have not this wish, for they have no\r\nabstract ideas to express. They are a people who live in the concrete.\r\n\r\nThe rise of great fortunes, which I have noted, has been too recent and\r\ntoo exceptional a phenomenon to have affected the generally tranquil and\r\neven tenor of South African social life. Among both Dutch and English\r\nmonths and years flow smoothly on. Few new immigrants enter the rural\r\ndistricts or the smaller towns; few new enterprises are started; few\r\nambitions or excitements stir the minds of the people. The Witwatersrand\r\ngold-field is, of course, a startling exception, but it is an exception\r\nwhich tends to perpetuate the rule, for, by drawing off the more eager\r\nand restless spirits, it has left the older parts of both the Colonies\r\nmore placid than ever. The general equality of conditions has produced a\r\nfreedom from assumption on the one hand, and from servility on the\r\nother, and, indeed, a general absence of snobbishness, which is quite\r\nrefreshing to the European visitor. Manners are simple, and being\r\nsimple, they are good. If there is less polish than in some countries,\r\nthere is an unaffected heartiness and kindliness. The Dutch have a sense\r\nof personal dignity which respects the dignity of their fellows, and\r\nwhich expresses itself in direct and natural forms of address. An\r\nexperienced observer dilated to me on the high level of decorum\r\nmaintained in the Cape Parliament, where scenes of disorder are, I\r\nbelieve, unknown, and violent language is rare. One expects to find in\r\nall Colonies a sense of equality and an element of _sans gêne_ in social\r\nintercourse. But one usually finds also more roughness and more of an\r\noff-hand, impatient way of treating strangers than is visible in South\r\nAfrica. This may be partly due to the fact that people are not in such a\r\nhurry as they are in most new countries. They have plenty of time for\r\neverything. The climate disinclines them to active exertion. There is\r\nlittle immigration. Trade, except in the four seaports,[71] is not\r\nbrisk, and even there it is not brisk in the American sense of the word.\r\nThe slackness of the black population, which has to be employed for the\r\nharder kinds of work, reacts upon the white employer. I have visited no\r\nnew English-speaking country where one so little felt the strain and\r\nstress of modern life. This feature of South African society, though it\r\nimplies a slow material development, is very agreeable to the visitor,\r\nand I doubt if it be really an injury to the ultimate progress of the\r\ncountry. In most parts of North America, possibly in Australia also,\r\nindustrial development has been too rapid, and has induced a nervous\r\nexcitability and eager restlessness of temper from which South Africa is\r\nfree. Of course, in saying this, I except always the mining districts,\r\nand especially the Witwatersrand, which is to the full as restless and\r\nas active as San Francisco or Melbourne.\r\n\r\nThe comparative ease of life disposes the English part of the population\r\nto athletic sports, which are pursued with almost as much avidity as in\r\nAustralia. Even one who thinks that in England the passion for them has\r\ngone beyond all reasonable limits, and has become a serious injury to\r\neducation and to the taste for intellectual pleasures, may find in the\r\ncharacter of the climate a justification for the devotion to cricket, in\r\nparticular, which strikes him in South Africa. Now that the wild animals\r\nhave become scarce, hunting cannot be pursued as it once was, and young\r\npeople would have little incitement to physical exertion in the open air\r\ndid not the English love of cricket flourish in the schools and\r\ncolleges. Long may it flourish!\r\n\r\nThe social conditions I have been describing are evidently unfavourable\r\nto the development of literature or science or art. Art has scarcely\r\nbegun to exist. Science is represented only by a few naturalists in\r\nGovernment employment, and by some intelligent amateur observers.\r\nResearches in electricity or chemistry or biology require nowadays a\r\nsomewhat elaborate apparatus, with which few private persons could\r\nprovide themselves, and which are here possessed only by one or two\r\npublic institutions. English and American writers have hitherto supplied\r\nthe intellectual needs of the people, and the established reputation of\r\nwriters in those countries makes competition difficult to a new colonial\r\nauthor. The towns are too small, and their inhabitants too much occupied\r\nin commerce to create groups of highly educated people, capable of\r\npolishing, whetting, and stimulating one another's intellects. There are\r\nfew large libraries, and no fully equipped university to train young men\r\nin history or philosophy or economics or theology. Accordingly, few\r\nbooks are composed or published, and, so far as I know, only three South\r\nAfrican writers have caught the ear of the European public. One of these\r\nwas Robert Pringle, a Scotchman, whose poems, written sixty or seventy\r\nyears ago, possess considerable merit, and one of which, beginning with\r\nthe line,\r\n\r\n    Afar in the desert I love to ride,\r\n\r\nremains the most striking picture of South African nature in those early\r\ndays when the wilderness was still filled with wild creatures. Another,\r\nMiss Olive Schreiner (now Mrs. Cronwright-Schreiner), has attained\r\ndeserved fame. A third, Mr. Scully, is less known in England, but his\r\nlittle volume of _Kafir Tales_ is marked by much graphic power and shows\r\ninsight into native character.\r\n\r\nThese three writers, and indeed all the writers of merit, belong to the\r\nEnglish or Anglified section of the population. The Dutch section is\r\npractically disqualified by its language (which, be it remembered, is\r\nnot the language of Holland, but a debased dialect) from literary\r\ncomposition, even were it otherwise disposed to authorship. Literature\r\nwill always, I think, remain English in character, bearing few or no\r\ntraces of the Dutch element in the people. But otherwise things are\r\nlikely to change in a few years. The conditions which have been\r\ndescribed as unfavourable to intellectual production are not necessarily\r\npermanent, and the time will probably come when the Europeans of South\r\nAfrica will emulate their kinsfolk at home or in North America in\r\nliterary and artistic fertility. The materials for imaginative work,\r\nwhether in poetry or in prose, lie ready to their hand. The scenery\r\ndeserves some great native landscape-painter, and such a genius will, no\r\ndoubt, one day arise.\r\n\r\nJournalism has now everywhere become, in point of quantity, the most\r\nimportant part of literature. The South African newspapers impress a\r\nvisitor favourably. Several of them are written with great ability, and\r\nthey were in 1895 comparatively free from that violence of invective,\r\nthat tawdriness of rhetoric, and that proneness to fill their columns\r\nwith criminal intelligence which are apt to be charged against the press\r\nin some other new countries. No journal seems to exert so great a\r\npolitical power as is wielded by several of the Australian dailies. As\r\nmight be expected, the Press is chiefly English, that language having\r\nsixty-one papers, against seventeen printed in Dutch and twenty-three in\r\nboth languages.\r\n\r\nAlthough the dispersion of the small European population over an\r\nexceedingly wide area makes it difficult to provide elementary schools\r\neverywhere,[72] education is, among the whites, well cared for, and in\r\nsome regions, such as the Orange Free State, the Boer element is just as\r\neager for it as is the English. Neither are efficient secondary schools\r\nwanting. That which is wanting, that which is urgently needed to crown\r\nthe educational edifice, is a properly equipped teaching university.\r\nThere are several colleges which provide lectures,[73] and the Cape\r\nUniversity holds examinations and confers degrees; but to erect over\r\nthese colleges a true university with an adequate teaching staff seems\r\nto be as difficult an enterprise at the Cape as it has proved to be in\r\nLondon, where thirteen years had to be spent in efforts, not successful\r\ntill 1898, to establish a teaching university. It is strange to find\r\nthat in a new country, where the different religious bodies live on good\r\nterms with one another, one of the chief obstacles in the way is the\r\nreluctance of two of the existing colleges, which have a denominational\r\ncharacter, to have an institution superior to them set up by the State.\r\nThe other obstacles are the rivalry of the eastern province with the\r\nwestern, in which, at Cape Town, the natural seat of a university would\r\nbe found, and the apathy or aversion of the Dutch section of the people.\r\nSome of them do not care to spend public money for a purpose whose value\r\nthey cannot be made to understand. Others, knowing that a university\r\nwould necessarily be mainly in English hands and give instruction of an\r\nEnglish type, fear to establish what would become another Anglifying\r\ninfluence. Thus several small colleges go on, each with inadequate\r\nresources, and the Cape youth who desires to obtain a first-rate\r\neducation is obliged to go to Europe for it. He cannot even get a full\r\ncourse of legal instruction, for there is no complete law school. It is\r\nno doubt well that a certain number of young men should go to Europe and\r\nthere acquire a first-hand knowledge of the ideas and habits of the Old\r\nWorld; but many who cannot afford the luxury of a European journey and\r\nresidence remain without the kind of instruction to which their natural\r\ngifts entitle them, and the intellectual progress of the country\r\nsuffers. Were Cape Colony somewhere in the United States, a millionaire\r\nwould forthwith step in, build a new university, and endow it with a few\r\nmillions of dollars. But South Africa is only just beginning to produce\r\ngreat fortunes; so the best hope is that some enlightened and tactful\r\nstatesman may, by disarming the suspicions and allaying the jealousies I\r\nhave described, succeed in uniting the existing colleges, and add to\r\ntheir scanty revenues an adequate Government grant. This may possibly be\r\neffected. But the jealousies and ambitions which those who control an\r\ninstitution feel for it are often quite as tenacious as is the\r\nselfishness of men where their own pockets are concerned; and since\r\nthese jealousies disguise themselves under a cloak of disinterestedness,\r\nit is all the more hard to overcome them by the pressure of public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nOne other intellectual force remains to be mentioned--that of the\r\nchurches. In the two British Colonies no religious body receives special\r\nState recognition or any grants from the State.[74] All are on an equal\r\nfooting, just as in Australia and in North America. In the two Boer\r\nRepublics the Dutch Reformed Church is in a certain sense the State\r\nchurch. In the Transvaal it is recognized as such by the Grondwet\r\n(\"Fundamental Law\"), and receives a Government subvention. In that\r\nRepublic members of other churches were at one time excluded from the\r\nsuffrage and from all public offices, and even now Roman Catholics are\r\nunder some disability. In the Orange Free State the Dutch Reformed\r\nChurch receives public aid, but I think this is given, to a smaller\r\nextent, to some other denominations also, and no legal inequalities\r\nbased on religion exist. In these two Republics nearly the whole of the\r\nBoer population, and in the Free State a part even of the English\r\npopulation, belong to the Dutch Reformed communion, which is\r\nPresbyterian in government and Calvinistic in theology. In the British\r\nColonies the Protestant Episcopal Church (Church of England) comes next\r\nafter the Dutch Reformed, which is much the strongest denomination; but\r\nthe Wesleyans are also an important body; and there are, of course, also\r\nCongregational and Baptist churches. The Presbyterians seem to be less\r\nnumerous (in proportion to the population) than in Canada or Australia,\r\nnot merely because the Scottish element is less numerous, but also\r\nbecause many of the Scottish settlers joined the Dutch Reformed Church\r\nas being akin to their own in polity and doctrine. The comparative\r\npaucity of Roman Catholics is due to the paucity of Irish\r\nimmigrants.[75] These bodies live in perfect harmony and good feeling\r\none with another, all frankly accepting the principle of equality, none\r\nclaiming any social pre-eminence, and none, so far as I could learn,\r\nattempting to interfere in politics. Both the bishops and the clergy of\r\nthe Church of England (among whom there are many gifted men) are, with\r\nfew exceptions, of marked High-church proclivities, which, however, do\r\nnot appear to prevail equally among the laity. The Dutch Reformed Church\r\nhas been troubled by doubts as to the orthodoxy of many of its younger\r\npastors who have been educated at Leyden or Utrecht, and for a time it\r\npreferred to send candidates for the ministry to be trained at\r\nEdinburgh, whose theological schools inspired less distrust. It is\r\nitself in its turn distrusted, apparently without reason, by the still\r\nmore rigid Calvinists of the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nOne curious feature of South African society remains to be mentioned,\r\nwhich impressed me the more the longer I remained in the country. The\r\nupper stratum of that society, consisting of the well-to-do and best\r\neducated people, is naturally small, because the whole white population\r\nof the towns is small, there being only four towns that have more than\r\nten thousand white residents. But this little society is virtually one\r\nsociety, though dispersed in spots hundreds of miles from one another.\r\nNatal stands rather apart, and has very little to do either socially or\r\nin the way of business with Cape Colony, and not a great deal even with\r\nthe Transvaal. So too the four or five towns of the eastern province of\r\nCape Colony form a group somewhat detached, and though the \"best people\"\r\nin each of them know all about the \"best people\" in Cape Town, they are\r\nnot in close touch with the latter. But Cape Town, Kimberley,\r\nBloemfontein, Johannesburg, and Pretoria, the five most important places\r\n(excluding the Natal towns), are for social purposes almost one city,\r\nthough it is six hundred and fifty miles from Cape Town to Kimberley,\r\nand one thousand miles from Cape Town to Johannesburg. All the persons\r\nof consequence in these places know one another and follow one another's\r\ndoings. All mix frequently, because the Cape Town people are apt to be\r\ncalled by business to the inland cities, and the residents of the inland\r\ncities come to Cape Town for sea air in the summer, or to embark thence\r\nfor Europe. Where distances are great, men think little of long\r\njourneys, and the fact that Cape Town is practically the one port of\r\nentrance and departure for the interior, so far as passengers are\r\nconcerned, keeps it in constant relations with the leading men of the\r\ninterior, and gives a sort of unity to the upper society of the whole\r\ncountry, which finds few parallels in any other part of the world.\r\nJohannesburg and Cape Town in particular are, for social purposes, in\r\ncloser touch with each other than Liverpool is with Manchester or New\r\nYork with Philadelphia. When one turns to the map it looks a long way\r\nfrom the Cape to the Witwatersrand; but between these places most of the\r\ncountry is a desert, and there is only one spot, Bloemfontein, that\r\ndeserves to be called a town. So I will once more beg the reader to\r\nremember that though South Africa is more than half as large as Europe,\r\nit is, measured by population, a very small country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: In Cape Colony 28.82 of the male and 28.02 of the female\r\npopulation could not (census of 1891) read or write.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Five colleges receive Government grants.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: The small grant for religious purposes made in Cape Colony\r\nwas in 1895 being reduced, and was to expire shortly.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: The census of 1891 gives the numbers as follows: Dutch\r\nReformed Church, 306,000; Church of England, 139,000; Wesleyans,\r\n106,000; Congregationalists, 69,000; Presbyterians, 37,000; Roman\r\nCatholics, 17,000; Mohammedans, 15,000.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nPOLITICS IN THE TWO BRITISH COLONIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the two South African Colonies are so dissimilar\r\nfrom those of the British Colonies in North America and in Australasia\r\nas to have impressed upon their politics a very different character. I\r\ndo not propose to describe the present political situation, for it may\r\nchange at any moment. It is only of the permanent causes which give\r\ntheir colour to the questions and the movements of the country that I\r\nshall speak, and that concisely.\r\n\r\nThe frame of government is, in Cape Colony as well as in Natal,\r\nessentially the same as in the other self-governing British Colonies.\r\nThere is a Governor, appointed by the home Government, and responsible\r\nto it only, who plays the part which belongs to the Crown in Great\r\nBritain. He is the nominal head of the executive, summoning and\r\nproroguing the Legislature, appointing and dismissing ministers, and\r\nexercising, upon the advice of his ministers, the prerogative of pardon.\r\nThere is a cabinet of five persons, including the heads of the chief\r\nadministrative departments, who are the practical executive of the\r\nColony, and are responsible to the Legislature, in which they sit, and\r\nat whose pleasure they hold their offices. There is a Legislature\r\nconsisting of two houses--an Assembly, whose membership was raised in\r\nDecember, 1898, from seventy-nine to ninety-five, and a Legislative\r\nCouncil, with twenty-three members, besides the Chief Justice, who is\r\n_ex officio_ President. In Cape Colony (for of the arrangements in Natal\r\nI have spoken in a previous chapter) both houses are elected on the same\r\nfranchise--a low one; but the districts for the election of members of\r\nthe Council are much larger, and therefore fewer, than the Assembly\r\ndistricts, so the former body is a small and the latter a comparatively\r\nnumerous one.[76] The rights and powers of both houses are theoretically\r\nthe same, save that money bills originate in the Assembly; but the\r\nAssembly is far more powerful, for the ministry holds office only so\r\nlong as it has the support of a majority in that body, whereas it need\r\nnot regard a hostile vote in the Council. Either the English or the\r\nDutch language may be used in debate. Ministers have the right of\r\nspeaking in both houses, but can, of course, vote only in the one of\r\nwhich they are members by popular election. If it happens that there is\r\nno minister who has a seat in the Council (as was the case in 1896), it\r\nis usual for the cabinet to allot one to be present in and look after\r\nthat chamber for the day.\r\n\r\nThis cabinet system, as it is called, works pretty smoothly, on lines\r\nsimilar to that English original whence it is copied. The most\r\ninteresting peculiarity is the Cape method of forming the smaller House.\r\nIn England the Upper House is composed of hereditary members; in the\r\nCanadian confederation, of members nominated for life--both of them\r\nmethods which are quite indefensible in theory. Here, however, we find\r\nthe same plan as that which prevails in the States of the North American\r\nUnion, all of which have senates elected on the same franchise, and for\r\nthe same term, as the larger house, but in more extensive districts, so\r\nas to make the number of members of the senate or second chamber\r\nsmaller. Regarding the merits of the Cape scheme, I heard different\r\nviews expressed. Nobody seemed opposed in principle to the division of\r\nthe Legislature into two houses, but many condemned the existing Council\r\nas being usually composed of second-rate men, and apt to be obstructive\r\nin its tendencies. Some thought the Council was a useful part of the\r\nscheme of government, because it interposed delay in legislation and\r\ngave time for reflection and further debate. One point came out pretty\r\nclearly. No difficulty is deemed to arise from the fact that there exist\r\ntwo popularly elected houses equally entitled to control the\r\nadministration,[77] for custom has settled that the Assembly or larger\r\nhouse is that whose vote determines the life of a ministry. But it\r\nfollows from this circumstance that the most able and ambitious men\r\ndesire a seat in the more powerful chamber, leaving the smaller house to\r\nthose of less mark. This is the exact reverse of what has happened in\r\nthe United States; where a seat in the Senate is more desired than one\r\nin the House; but it is a natural result of the diverse arrangements of\r\nthe two countries, for in the Federal Government the Senate has some\r\npowers which the House of Representatives does not enjoy, while in each\r\nof the several States of the Union, although the powers of the two\r\nhouses are almost the same, the smaller number of each Senate secures\r\nfor a senator somewhat greater importance than a member of the larger\r\nbody enjoys. The Cape Colony plan of letting a minister speak in both\r\nhouses works very well, and may deserve to be imitated in England, where\r\nthe fact that the head of a department can explain his policy only to\r\nhis own House has sometimes caused inconvenience.\r\n\r\nSo much for the machinery. Now let us note the chief points in which the\r\ncircumstances of Cape Colony and of Natal (for in these respects both\r\nColonies are alike) differ from those of the other self-governing\r\nColonies of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe population is not homogeneous as regards race, but consists of two\r\nstocks, English and Dutch. These stocks are not, as in Canada, locally\r\nseparate, but dwell intermixed, though the Dutch element predominates in\r\nthe western province and in the interior generally, the English in the\r\neastern province and at the Kimberley diamond-fields.\r\n\r\nThe population is homogeneous as regards religion, for nearly all are\r\nProtestants, and Protestants of much the same type. Race difference has\r\nfortunately not been complicated, as in Canada, by ecclesiastical\r\nantagonisms.\r\n\r\nThe population is homogeneous as respects material interests, for it is\r\nwholly agricultural and pastoral, except a few merchants and artisans in\r\nthe seaports, and a few miners at Kimberley and in Namaqualand.\r\nFour-fifths of it are practically rural, for the interests of the small\r\ntowns are identical with those of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nThe population is not only rural, but scattered more thinly over a vast\r\narea than in any other British Colony, except north-western Canada, and\r\nparts of Australasia. In Natal there are only two white men to the\r\nsquare mile, and in Cape Colony less than two. Nor is this sparseness\r\nincidental, as in North America, to the early days of settlement. It is\r\ndue to a physical condition--the condition of the soil--which is likely\r\nto continue.\r\n\r\nBelow the white citizens, who are the ruling race, there lies a thick\r\nstratum of coloured population numerically larger, and likely to remain\r\nso, because it performs all the unskilled labour of the country. Here\r\nis a condition which, though present in some of the Southern States of\r\nAmerica, is fortunately absent from all the self-governing Colonies of\r\nBritain, and indeed caused Jamaica to be, some time ago, withdrawn from\r\nthat category.\r\n\r\nThe conjunction of these circumstances marks off South Africa as a very\r\npeculiar country, where we may expect to find a correspondingly peculiar\r\npolitical situation. Comparing it to other Colonies, we may say that the\r\nCape and Natal resemble Canada in the fact that there are two European\r\nraces present, and resemble the Southern States of America in having a\r\nlarge mass of coloured people beneath the whites. But South Africa is in\r\nother respects unlike both; and although situated in the southern\r\nhemisphere, it bears little resemblance to Australia.\r\n\r\nNow let us see how the circumstances above described have determined the\r\npolitical issues that have arisen in Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nCertain issues are absent which exist, not only in Europe and the United\r\nStates, but also in Australia and in Canada. There is no antagonism of\r\nrich and poor, because there are very few poor and still fewer rich.\r\nThere is no working-man's or labour party, because so few white men are\r\nemployed in handicrafts. There is no Socialist movement, nor is any\r\nlikely soon to arise, because the mass of workers, to whom elsewhere\r\nSocialism addresses itself, is mainly composed of black people, and no\r\nwhite would dream of collectivism for the benefit of blacks. Thus the\r\nwhole group of labour questions, which bulks so largely in modern\r\nindustrial States, is practically absent, and replaced by a different\r\nset of class questions, to be presently mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere is no regularly organized Protectionist party, nor is the\r\nprotection of native industry a \"live issue\" of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe farmers and ranchmen of Cape Colony no doubt desire to have custom\r\nduties on food-stuffs that will help them to keep up prices, and they\r\nhave got such duties. But the scale is not very high, and as direct\r\ntaxation is difficult to raise in a new country with a scattered\r\npopulation, the existing tariff, which averages twelve and a half per\r\ncent, _ad valorem_ (but is further raised by special rates on certain\r\narticles), may be defended as needed, at least to a large extent, for\r\nthe purposes of revenue. Natal had a lower tariff, and has been more\r\nfavourable in principle to free trade doctrine, but she has very\r\nrecently (1898) entered the S. African Customs Union, therewith adopting\r\na higher tariff. Manufactures have been so sparingly developed in both\r\nColonies that neither employers nor workmen have begun to call for high\r\nduties against foreign goods. Here, therefore, is another field of\r\npolicy, important in North America and Australia, which has given rise\r\nto comparatively little controversy in South Africa.\r\n\r\nAs there is no established church, and nearly all the people are\r\nProtestants, there are no ecclesiastical questions, nor is the progress\r\nof education let and hindered by the claims of sects to have their\r\nrespective creeds taught at the expense of the State.\r\n\r\nNeither are there any land questions, such as those which have arisen in\r\nAustralia, for there has been land enough for those who want to have it,\r\nwhile few agricultural immigrants arrive to increase the demand.\r\nMoreover, though the landed estates are large, their owners are not\r\nrich, and excite no envy by their possession of a profitable monopoly.\r\nIf any controversy regarding natural resources arises, it will probably\r\nturn on the taxation of minerals. Some have suggested that the State\r\nshould appropriate to itself a substantial share of the profits made out\r\nof the diamond and other mines, and the fact that most of those profits\r\nare sent home to shareholders in Europe might be expected to make the\r\nsuggestion popular. Nevertheless, the idea has not, so far, \"caught\r\non,\" to use a familiar expression, partly, perhaps, because Cape Colony,\r\ndrawing sufficent income from its tariff and its railways, has not found\r\nit necessary to hunt for other sources of revenue.\r\n\r\nLastly, there are no constitutional questions. The suffrage is so wide\r\nas to admit nearly all the whites, and there is, of course, no desire to\r\ngo lower and admit more blacks. The machinery of government is deemed\r\nsatisfactory; at any rate, one hears of no proposals to change it, and,\r\nas will be seen presently, there is not in either Colony a wish to alter\r\nthe relations now subsisting between it and the mother country.\r\n\r\nThe reader may suppose that if all these grounds of controversy,\r\nfamiliar to Europe, and some of them now unhappily familiar to the new\r\ndemocracies also, are absent, South Africa enjoys the political\r\ntranquillity of a country where there are no factions, and the only\r\nquestion is how to find the men best able to promote that economic\r\ndevelopment which all unite in desiring. This is by no means the case.\r\nIn South Africa the part filled elsewhere by constitutional questions,\r\nand industrial questions and ecclesiastical questions, and currency\r\nquestions, is filled by race questions and colour questions. Colour\r\nquestions have been discussed in a previous chapter. They turn not, as\r\nin the Southern States of America, upon the political rights of the\r\nblack man (for on this subject the ruling whites are in both Colonies\r\nunanimous), but upon land rights and the regulation of native labour.\r\nThey are not at this moment actual and pungent issues, but they are in\r\nthe background of every one's mind, and the attitude of each man to them\r\ngoes far to determine his political sympathies. One cannot say that\r\nthere exist pro-native or anti-native parties, but the Dutch are by\r\ntradition more disposed than the English to treat the native severely,\r\nand, as they express it, keep him in his place. Many Englishmen share\r\nthe Dutch feeling, yet it is always by Englishmen that the advocacy of\r\nthe native case is undertaken. In Natal both races are equally\r\nanti-Indian.\r\n\r\nThe race question among the whites, that is to say the rivalry of Dutch\r\nand English, would raise no practical issue were Cape Colony an island\r\nin the ocean, for there is complete political and social equality\r\nbetween the two stocks, and the material interests of the Dutch farmer\r\nare the same as those of his English neighbour. It is the existence of a\r\ncontiguous foreign State, the South African Republic, that sharpens\r\nDutch feeling. The Boers who remained in Cape Colony and in Natal have\r\nalways retained their sentiment of kinship with those who went out in\r\nthe Great Trek of 1836, or who moved northward from Natal into the\r\nTransvaal after the annexation of Natal in 1842. Many of them are\r\nconnected by family ties with the inhabitants of the two Republics, and\r\nare proud of the achievements of their kinsfolk against Dingaan and\r\nMosilikatze, and of the courage displayed at Laing's Nek and Majuba Hill\r\nagainst the British. They resent keenly any attempt to trench upon the\r\nindependence of the Transvaal, while most of the English do not conceal\r\ntheir wish to bring that State into a South African Confederation, if\r\npossible under the British flag. The ministries and legislatures of the\r\ntwo British Colonies, it need hardly be said, have no official relations\r\nwith the two Dutch Republics, because, according to the constitution of\r\nthe British empire, such relations, like all other foreign relations,\r\nbelong to the Crown, and the Crown is advised by the British Cabinet at\r\nhome. In South Africa the Crown is represented for the purpose of these\r\nrelations by the High Commissioner, who is not responsible in any way to\r\nthe colonial legislatures, and is not even bound to consult the colonial\r\ncabinet, for his functions as High Commissioner for South Africa are\r\ndeemed to be distinct from those which he has as Governor of Cape\r\nColony. Matters relating to the two Republics and their relation to the\r\nColonies are, accordingly, outside the sphere of action of the colonial\r\nlegislatures, which have, in strict theory, no right to pass resolutions\r\nregarding them. In point of fact, however, the Cape Assembly frequently\r\ndoes debate, and pass resolutions on, these matters; nor is this\r\npractice disapproved, for, as the sentiments of the Colony are, or ought\r\nto be, an important factor in determining the action of the home\r\nGovernment, it is well that the British Cabinet and the High\r\nCommissioner should possess such a means of gauging those sentiments.\r\nThe same thing happens with regard to any other question between Britain\r\nand a foreign Power which may affect the two Colonies. Questions with\r\nGermany or Portugal, questions as to the acquisition of territory in\r\nSouth Central Africa, would also be discussed in the colonial\r\nLegislatures, just as those of Australia some years ago complained\r\nwarmly of the action of France in the New Hebrides. And thus it comes to\r\npass that though the Governments and Legislatures of the Colonies have\r\nin strictness nothing to do with foreign policy, foreign policy has had\r\nmuch to do with the formation of parties at the Cape.\r\n\r\nNow as to the parties themselves. Hitherto I have spoken of Natal and\r\nthe Cape together, because their conditions are generally similar,\r\nthough the Dutch element is far stronger in the latter than in the\r\nformer. In what follows I speak of the Cape only, for political parties\r\nhave not had time to grow up in Natal, where responsible government\r\ndates from 1893. In the earlier days of the Cape Legislature parties\r\nwere not strongly marked, though they tended to coincide with the race\r\ndistinction between Dutch and English, because the western province was\r\nchiefly Dutch, and the eastern chiefly English, and there was a certain\r\nrivalry or antagonism between these two main divisions of the country.\r\nThe Dutch element was, moreover, wholly agricultural and pastoral, the\r\nEnglish party mercantile; so when an issue arose between these two\r\ninterests, it generally corresponded with the division of races.\r\nPolitical organization was chiefly in English hands, because the\r\ncolonial Dutch had not possessed representative government, whereas the\r\nEnglish brought their home habits with them. However, down till 1880\r\nparties remained in an amorphous or fluid condition, being largely\r\naffected by the influence of individual leaders; and the Dutch section\r\nof the electorate was hardly conscious of its strength. In the end of\r\nthat year, the rising in the Transvaal, and the War of Independence\r\nwhich followed, powerfully stimulated Dutch feeling, and led to the\r\nformation of the Africander Bond, a league or association appealing\r\nnominally to African, but practically to African-Dutch patriotism. It\r\nwas not anti-English in the sense of hostility to the British\r\nconnection, any more than was the French party in Lower Canada at the\r\nsame time, but it was based not only on the solidarity of the Dutch race\r\nover all South Africa, but also on the doctrine that Africanders must\r\nthink of Africa first, and see that the country was governed in\r\naccordance with local sentiment, rather than on British lines or with a\r\nview to British interests. Being Dutch, the Bond became naturally the\r\nrural or agricultural and pastoral party, and therewith inclined to a\r\nprotective tariff and to stringent legislation in native matters. Such\r\nanti-English tint as this association originally wore tended to fade\r\nwhen the Transvaal troubles receded into the distance, and when it was\r\nperceived that the British Government became more and more disposed to\r\nleave the Colony to manage its own affairs. And this was still more the\r\ncase after the rise to power of Mr. Cecil Rhodes, who, while receiving\r\nthe support of the Bond and the Dutch party generally, was known to be\r\nalso a strong Imperialist, eager to extend the range of British power\r\nover the continent. At the same time, the attachment of the colonial\r\nDutch to the Transvaal cooled down under the unfriendly policy of that\r\nRepublic, whose government imposed heavy import duties on their\r\nfood-stuffs, and denied to their youth the opportunities of obtaining\r\nposts in the public service of the Republic, preferring to fetch\r\nDutch-speaking men from Holland, when it could have had plenty of\r\ncapable people from the Cape who spoke the tongue and knew the ways of\r\nthe country. Thus the embers of Dutch and English antagonism seemed to\r\nbe growing cold when they were suddenly fanned again into a flame by the\r\nfresh Transvaal troubles of December, 1895, which caused the resignation\r\nof Mr. Rhodes, and the severance from him of his Dutch supporters. Too\r\nlittle time has elapsed since those events to make it possible to\r\npredict how parties may reshape themselves, nor is it any part of my\r\nplan to deal with current politics. In 1897 feeling still ran high, but\r\nit had not destroyed the previously friendly social relations of the\r\nraces, and there was then reason to hope that within a few months or\r\nyears mutual confidence would be restored.\r\n\r\nSo far as I could ascertain, both local government and central\r\ngovernment are in the two Colonies, as well as in the Orange Free State,\r\npure and honest. The judiciary is above all suspicion, and includes\r\nseveral distinguished men. The civil service is managed on English\r\nprinciples, there being no elective offices; and nothing resembling what\r\nis called the \"caucus system\" seems to have grown up. There are in the\r\nCape Legislature some few members supposed to be \"low-toned\" and open to\r\ninfluence by the prospect of material gain, but, though I heard of\r\noccasional jobbing, I heard of little or nothing amounting to\r\ncorruption. Elections were said to be free from bribery, but as they had\r\nseldom excited keen interest, this point of superiority to most\r\ncountries need not be ascribed to moral causes.\r\n\r\nReviewing the course of Cape politics during the thirty years of\r\nresponsible government, that course appears smooth when compared with\r\nthe parallel current of events in the Australian Colonies. There have\r\nbeen few constitutional crises, and no exciting struggles over purely\r\ndomestic issues. This is due not merely to the absence of certain causes\r\nof strife, but also to the temper of the people, and their thin\r\ndispersion over a vast territory. In large town populations excitement\r\ngrows by the sympathy of numbers, but South Africa has only five or six\r\ntowns in which a public meeting of even three hundred citizens could be\r\ngathered. The Dutch are tardy, cautious and reserved. The doggedness of\r\ntheir ancestors who resisted Philip II. of Spain lives in them still.\r\nThey have a slow tenacious intensity, like that of a forest fire, which\r\nsmoulders long among the prostrate trunks before it bursts into flame.\r\nBut they are, except when deeply stirred, conservative and slow to move.\r\nThey dislike change so much as to be unwilling to change their\r\nrepresentatives or their ministers. A Cape statesman told me that the\r\nDutch members of the Assembly would often say to him: \"We think you\r\nwrong in this instance, and we are going to vote against you, but we\r\ndon't want to turn you out; stay on in office as before.\" So President\r\nKruger observed to me, in commenting on the frequent changes of\r\ngovernment in England: \"When we have found an ox who makes a good leader\r\nof the team, we keep him there, instead of shifting the cattle about in\r\nthe hope of finding a better one;\" and in saying this he expressed the\r\nfeelings and habits of his race. To an Englishman the Dutch seem to want\r\nthat interest in politics for the sake of politics which marks not only\r\nthe English (and still more the Irish) at home but also the English\r\nstock in North America and Australia. But this very fact makes them all\r\nthe more fierce and stubborn when some issue arises which stirs their\r\ninmost mind, and it is a fact to be remembered by those who have to\r\ngovern them. The things they care most about are their religion, their\r\nrace ascendency over the blacks, and their Dutch-African nationality as\r\nrepresented by their kinsfolk in the two Republics. The first of these\r\nhas never been tampered with; the two latter have been at the bottom of\r\nall the serious difficulties that have arisen between them and the\r\nEnglish. That which was in 1897 exciting them and forming the crucial\r\nissue in Cape politics was the strained condition of things which\r\nexisted in the Transvaal. I propose in the following chapter to explain\r\nhow that condition came about, and to sketch its salient features.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: There are for the Council seven electoral provinces, each\r\nof which returns three members to the Council, besides one for\r\nGriqualand West and one for British Bechuanaland.\r\n\r\nA Redistribution Act of 1898 altered the areas of some of the electoral\r\ndivisions, and the number of members returned by some, so as to adjust\r\nrepresentation more accurately to population.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: Some friction has, however, arisen from the right claimed\r\nby the Council of amending money bills, especially for the purpose (one\r\nis told) of securing grants to the electoral provinces they represent.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE SITUATION IN THE TRANSVAAL BEFORE THE RISING OF 1895\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agitation at Johannesburg, which Dr. Jameson's expedition turned\r\ninto a rising, took place in December, 1895. I spent some time in\r\nPretoria and Johannesburg in the preceding month, and had good\r\nopportunities of observing the symptoms of political excitement and\r\ngauging the tendencies at work which were so soon to break out and fix\r\nthe eyes of the world upon the Witwatersrand. The situation was a\r\nsingular one, without parallel in history; and though I did not know\r\nthat the catastrophe was so near at hand, it was easy to see that a\r\nconflict must come and would prove momentous to South Africa. Of this\r\nsituation as it presented itself to a spectator who had no personal\r\ninterest involved, and had the advantage of hearing both sides, I\r\npropose to speak in the present chapter.\r\n\r\nTo comprehend the position of the Transvaal Boers one must know\r\nsomething of their history. From the brief sketch of it given in earlier\r\nchapters (Chapters XI and XII) the reader will have gathered how unlike\r\nthey are to any European people or to the people of the United States.\r\nSevered from Europe and its influences two hundred years ago, they have,\r\nin some of the elements of modern civilisation, gone back rather than\r\nforward. They were in 1885, when the Rand goldfields were discovered,\r\nand many of them are to-day, a half-nomad race, pasturing their flocks\r\nand herds over the vast spaces of what is still a wilderness, and\r\nmigrating in their waggons from the higher to the lower pastures\r\naccording to the season of the year--\r\n\r\n                                      --Omnia secum\r\n    Armentarius Afer agit, tectumque laremque\r\n    Armaque, Amyclæumque canem, Cressamque pharetram.\r\n\r\nLiving in the open air, and mostly in the saddle, they are strangely\r\nignorant and old fashioned in all their ideas. They have no literature\r\nand very few newspapers. Their religion is the Dutch and Huguenot\r\nCalvinism of the seventeenth century, rigid and stern, hostile to all\r\nnew light, imbued with the spirit of the Old Testament rather than of\r\nthe New. They dislike and despise the Kafirs, whom they have regarded as\r\nIsrael may have regarded Amalek, and whom they have treated with equal\r\nseverity. They hate the English also,[78] who are to them the hereditary\r\nenemies that conquered them at the Cape; that drove them out into the\r\nwilderness in 1836; that annexed their Republic in 1877, and thereafter\r\nbroke the promises of self-government made at the time of the\r\nannexation; that stopped their expansion on the west by occupying\r\nBechuanaland, and on the north by occupying Matabililand and\r\nMashonaland; and that were still, as they believed, plotting to find\r\nsome pretext for overthrowing their independence.[79] This hatred is\r\nmingled with a contempt for those whom they defeated at Laing's Nek and\r\nMajuba Hill, and with a fear born of the sense that the English are\r\ntheir superiors in knowledge, in activity, and in statecraft. It is\r\nalways hard for a nation to see the good qualities of its rivals and the\r\nstrong points of its opponents' case; but with the Boers the difficulty\r\nis all the greater because they know little or nothing of the modern\r\nworld and of international politics. Two centuries of solitary pastoral\r\nlife have not only given them an aversion for commerce, for industrial\r\npursuits, and for finance, but an absolute incapacity for such\r\noccupations, so that when gold was discovered in their country, they did\r\nnot even attempt to work it,[80] but were content to sell, usually for a\r\nprice far below its value, the land where the gold-reefs lay, and move\r\noff with the proceeds to resume elsewhere their pastoral life. They have\r\nthe virtues appropriate to a simple society. They are brave,\r\ngood-natured, hospitable, faithful to one another, generally pure in\r\ntheir domestic life, seldom touched by avarice or ambition. But the\r\ncorruption of their Legislature shows that it is rather to the absence\r\nof temptation than to any superior strength of moral principle that\r\nthese merits have been due. For politics they have little taste or gift.\r\nPolitics can flourish only where people are massed together, and the\r\nBoer is a solitary being who meets his fellows solely for the purposes\r\nof religion or some festive gathering. Yet ignorant and slow-witted as\r\nthey are, inborn ability and resolution are not wanting. They have\r\nindeed a double measure of wariness and wiliness in their intercourse\r\nwith strangers, because their habitual suspicion makes them seek in\r\ncraft the defence for their ignorance of affairs; while their native\r\ndoggedness is confirmed by their belief in the continued guidance and\r\nprotection of that Providence whose hand led them through the wilderness\r\nand gave them the victory over all their enemies.\r\n\r\nThis was the people into whose territory there came, after 1884, a\r\nsudden swarm of gold-seekers. The Uitlanders, as these strangers are\r\ncalled (the word is not really Dutch, one is told, but an adaptation\r\nfrom the German), who by 1890 had come to equal and soon thereafter\r\nexceeded the whole number of the Boers, belonged to many stocks. The\r\nnatives of England, the Cape, and Natal were the most numerous, but\r\nthere were also many English-speaking men from other regions, including\r\nAustralians and Americans, as well as a smaller number of Germans and\r\nScandinavians, some Russians (mostly Jews) and a few Italians and\r\nFrenchmen. Unlike as these newcomers were to one another, they were all\r\nstill more unlike the rude hunting and pastoral people among whom they\r\ncame. They were miners, traders, financiers, engineers, keen,\r\nnimble-minded men, all more or less skilled in their respective crafts,\r\nall bent on gain, and most of them with that sense of irresponsibility\r\nand fondness for temporary pleasure which a chanceful and uncertain\r\nlife, far from home, and relieved from the fear of public opinion, tends\r\nto produce. Except some of the men from the two Colonies, they could not\r\nspeak the Boer _Taal_, and had no means of communication, any more than\r\nthey had social or moral affinities, with the folk of the land. There\r\nwere therefore no beginnings of any assimilation between them and the\r\nlatter. They did not affect the Boers, except with a sense of repulsion,\r\nand still less did the Boers affect them. Moreover, there were few\r\noccasions for social intercourse. The Uitlanders settled only along the\r\nWitwatersrand, and were aggregated chiefly in Johannesburg. The Boers\r\nwho had lived on the Rand, except a few who came daily into the towns\r\nwith their waggons to sell milk and vegetables, retired from it. It was\r\nonly in Pretoria and in a few of the villages that there was any direct\r\nsocial contact between the two elements.\r\n\r\nAlthough less than half of the immigrants came from England, probably\r\nfive-sixths spoke English and felt themselves drawn together not only by\r\nlanguage, but by community of ideas and habits. The Australians, the\r\nAmericans, and the men from Cape Colony and Natal considered themselves\r\nfor all practical--I do not say for all political--purposes to be\r\nEnglish, and English became the general spoken tongue not only of\r\nJohannesburg, but of the mining districts generally. Hearing nothing but\r\nEnglish spoken, seeing nothing all round them that was not far more\r\nEnglish than Dutch, though English with a half-colonial, half-American\r\ntinge, it was natural that the bulk of the Uitlanders should deem\r\nthemselves to be in a country which had become virtually English, and\r\nshould see something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a\r\nsmall body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors.\r\nHowever, before I describe their sentiments and their schemes, some\r\naccount must be given of the government under which they lived.\r\n\r\nAs was explained in a previous chapter (Chapter XII) the South African\r\nRepublic was formed by the union, between 1858 and 1862, of several\r\nsmall and theretofore practically independent republican communities.\r\nIts constitution was set forth in a document called the Grondwet,[81] or\r\n\"Fundamental Law,\" enacted in 1858 and partly based on a prior draft of\r\n1855. It is a very crude, and indeed rude, instrument, occasionally\r\nobscure, and containing much matter not fit for a constitution. It\r\nbreathes, however, a thoroughly free spirit, save as regards Kafirs and\r\nRoman Catholics, recognizing the people as a source of power, laying\r\ndown the old distinction between the three departments of\r\ngovernment,--legislative, executive, and judicial,--and guaranteeing\r\nsome of the primordial rights of the citizen. By it the government was\r\nvested in a President, head of the executive, and elected for five\r\nyears, an Executive Council of five members (three elected and two _ex\r\nofficio_), and a Legislature called the Volksraad, elected by the\r\ncitizens on a very extended suffrage, and declared to be the supreme\r\npower in the State. The Volksraad consists of one chamber, in which\r\nthere are at present twenty-four members. The President has the right of\r\nspeaking, though not of voting, in it, but has no veto on its action.\r\nThough there are few constitutions anywhere which give such unlimited\r\npower to the Legislature, the course of events--oft-recurring troubles\r\nof all sorts, native wars, internal dissensions, financial pressure,\r\nquestions with the British Government--have made the President\r\npractically more important than the Legislature, and, in fact, the main\r\nforce in the Republic. The Executive Council has exerted little power\r\nand commanded little deference, while the Volksraad has usually been\r\nguided by the President and has never taken the direction of affairs out\r\nof his hands. Both legislation and administration have been carried on\r\nin a rough-and-ready fashion, sometimes in violation of the strict\r\nletter of the law. In particular the provision of the Grondwet, that no\r\nstatute should be enacted without being submitted for a period of three\r\nmonths to the people, has been practically ignored by the enactment as\r\nlaws of a large number of resolutions on matters not really urgent,\r\nalthough the Grondwet permits this to be done only in cases which do not\r\nadmit of delay. This has, however, been rectified by a law passed\r\nsubsequently to 1895, altering the provision of the Grondwet.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, when the Republic recovered its independence, there were\r\nneither roads, railways, nor telegraphs in the country. Its towns were\r\nrough hamlets planted round a little church. Its people had only the\r\nbare necessaries of life. The taxes produced scarcely any revenue. The\r\ntreasury was empty, and the Government continued to be hard-pressed for\r\nmoney and unable to construct public works or otherwise improve the\r\ncountry till 1885, when the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand began\r\nto turn a stream of gold into its coffers. Riches brought new\r\ndifficulties and new temptations. Immigrants rushed in,--capitalists,\r\nminers, and traders. As the produce of the gold-field increased, it\r\nbecame plain that they would come in ever increasing numbers. The old\r\nBoers took alarm. The rush could hardly have been stopped, and to stop\r\nit would have involved a check in the expansion of the revenue. It was\r\naccordingly determined to maintain the political _status quo_ by\r\nexcluding these newcomers from political rights. The Grondwet declares\r\n(Article VI.) that \"the territory is open for every foreigner who obeys\r\nthe laws of the Republic,\" and as late as 1881 an immigrant could\r\nacquire the electoral franchise after a residence of two years. In 1882,\r\nhowever, this period was raised to five years, and in 1887 to fifteen.\r\nIn 1890, by which time the unenfranchised strangers had begun to agitate\r\nfor the right to be represented, a nominal concession was made by the\r\ncreation of a new chamber, called the Second Volksraad, for membership\r\nin which a newcomer might be eligible after taking an oath of allegiance\r\nfollowed by four years' residence, the right to vote at elections to\r\nthis chamber being attainable after the oath and two years' residence.\r\nThis Second Raad, however, is limited to the consideration of certain\r\nspecified subjects, not including taxation, and its acts can be\r\noverruled by the First Volksraad, while its assent is not required to\r\nthe acts of that body. It has therefore turned out little better than a\r\nsham, having, in fact, been created only as a tub to throw to the\r\nUitlander whale. The effect of the legislation of 1890 and subsequent\r\nyears down to 1894 (legislation too intricate and confused to be set\r\nforth in detail here) has been to debar any immigrant from acquiring the\r\nright to vote for the First Volksraad until he has passed the age of\r\nforty and resided for at least twelve years in the country after taking\r\nthe oath and being placed on the local government lists, lists on which\r\nthe local authorities are said to be nowise careful to place him. Nor\r\ndoes birth in the Republic confer citizenship, unless the father has\r\ntaken the oath of allegiance. President Kruger, who has held office\r\nsince 1881, was chiefly instrumental in passing these laws, for his\r\nforce of character, long experience of affairs, and services in the\r\ncrisis of 1877-81 gave him immense power over the Raad, in which he\r\nconstantly spoke, threatening the members with the loss of national\r\nindependence unless they took steps to stem the rising tide of foreign\r\ninfluence. As a patriot, he feared the English; as a Boer Puritan of the\r\nold stubborn stock, he hated all foreigners and foreign ways, seeing in\r\nthem the ruin of the ancient customs of his people. He carried this\r\nantagonism so far that, being unable to find among his citizens men\r\nsufficiently educated to deal with the growing mass of administrative\r\nwork which the increase of wealth, industry, and commerce brought, he\r\nrefused to appoint Dutch-speaking men from the Cape or Natal, because\r\nthey were natives of British Colonies, and recruited his civil service\r\nfrom Holland. The Hollanders he imported were far more strange to the\r\ncountry than Cape Dutchmen would have been, and the Boers did not, and\r\ndo not now, take kindly to them. But they were, by the necessity of\r\ntheir position, anti-English, and that was enough.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the old Boer virtues were giving way under new temptations.\r\nThe Volksraad (as is believed all over South Africa) became corrupt,\r\nthough of course there have always been pure and upright men among its\r\nmembers. The civil service was not above suspicion. Rich men and\r\npowerful corporations surrounded those who had concessions to give or\r\nthe means of influencing legislation, whether directly or indirectly.\r\nThe very inexperience of the Boer ranchman who came up as a member of\r\nthe Volksraad made him an easy prey. All sorts of abuses sprang up,\r\nwhile the primary duties of a government were very imperfectly\r\nperformed. Hardly any administration was needed while the Transvaal had\r\na population of wandering stock-farmers. But when one hundred thousand\r\nwhite immigrants were congregated along the Witwatersrand, and were\r\nemploying some fifty thousand native workpeople, an efficient police, an\r\nabundant water-supply, good sanitary regulations, and laws to keep\r\nliquor from the natives became urgently needed; and none of these things\r\nwas provided, although taxation continued to rise and the treasury was\r\noverflowing. Accordingly, the discontent of the Uitlanders increased. It\r\nwas no longer a mere question of obtaining political rights for their\r\nown sake, it was also a question of winning political power in order to\r\nreform the administration, and so secure those practical benefits which\r\nthe President and the Volksraad and the Hollander officials were either\r\nunable or unwilling to give. In 1892 an association, called the National\r\nUnion, was formed by a number of Uitlanders, \"to obtain, by all\r\nconstitutional means, equal rights for all citizens of the Republic, and\r\nthe redress of all grievances.\" Although nearly all those who formed it\r\nwere natives either of England or of the British Colonies, it did not\r\nseek to bring the country under British control, but included among its\r\naims \"the maintenance of the independence of the Republic.\"\r\nNevertheless, it incurred the hostility of the President and his\r\nfriends, and its petitions were unceremoniously repulsed. This tended to\r\naccentuate the anti-Boer feeling of the Uitlanders, so that when Sir H.\r\nLoch, the High Commissioner, came up from the Cape in 1894 to negotiate\r\nregarding Swaziland and other pending questions, he was made the object\r\nof a vehement demonstration at Pretoria. The English took the horses out\r\nof his carriage and drew it through the streets, waving the British flag\r\neven over the head of President Kruger himself, and shouting \"Reform!\r\nreform!\" This incident redoubled Mr. Kruger's apprehensions, but did not\r\nshake his purpose. It suggested new plans to the Uitlanders, who had\r\n(shortly before) been further incensed by the demand of the Government\r\nthat they should, although debarred from the suffrage, serve in a\r\nmilitary commando sent against the Kafir chief Malaboch. Despairing of\r\nconstitutional agitation, they began to provide themselves with arms and\r\nto talk of a general rising. Another cause, which I have not yet\r\nmentioned, had recently sharpened their eagerness for reforms. About\r\n1892 the theory was propounded that the gold-bearing reefs might be\r\nworked not only near the surface, but also at much greater depths, and\r\nthat, owing to the diminution of the angle of the dip as the beds\r\ndescend into the earth, a much greater mass of gold-bearing rock might\r\nbe reached than had been formerly deemed possible. This view, soon\r\nconfirmed by experimental borings, promised a far longer life to the\r\nmines than had been previously expected. Those who had come to the Rand\r\nthinking they might probably leave it after a few years now conceived\r\nthe idea of permanent residence, while the directors of the great mining\r\ncompanies, perceiving how much their industry might be developed,\r\nsmarted more than ever under the maladministration and exactions from\r\nwhich the industry suffered.\r\n\r\nThese were the events and these the causes that had brought about the\r\nstate of things which a visitor saw at Pretoria and Johannesburg in\r\nNovember, 1895. Revolution was already in the air, but few could guess\r\nwhat form it would take. The situation was a complicated one, because\r\neach of the two main sections of the population, Boers and Uitlanders,\r\nwas itself subdivided into minor groups. The Uitlanders were of many\r\nnationalities; but those who spoke English were so much the most\r\nnumerous that I shall speak of them only, dismissing the remainder with\r\nthe remark that while many of them sympathized with the Reform movement,\r\nfew of them gave it active support, while most of the Germans, moved by\r\nanti-British feeling, favoured President Kruger's Government.\r\n\r\nThe English section, including Cape and Natal men, Australians and\r\nAmericans, consisted of three sets of persons: the middle classes, the\r\ncapitalist mine-owners, and the working men. The middle class people,\r\ntraders, professional men, engineers, and the like, either belonged to\r\nor were in sympathy with the National Union. It was they who had formed\r\nit. They had recently presented to the Volksraad a petition, signed by\r\nthirty-eight thousand non-enfranchised residents, asking for reforms,\r\nand this petition had been scornfully rejected, one member saying, with\r\nno disapproval from his colleagues, that if the strangers wanted to get\r\nwhat they called their rights they would have to fight for them. Their\r\nagitation had been conducted publicly and on constitutional lines,\r\nwithout threats of force. It was becoming plain, however, in 1895, that\r\nsome at least of the leaders were now prepared to use force and would\r\ntake arms whenever a prospect of success appeared. But under what flag\r\nwould they fight? Would they adhere to their original idea, and maintain\r\nan independent South African Republic when they had ejected the dominant\r\noligarchy and secured political power for all residents? Or would they\r\nhoist the Union Jack and carry the country back under the British\r\nCrown? No one could speak positively, but most thought that the former\r\ncourse would be taken. The Americans would be for it. Most of the Cape\r\npeople who came of Dutch stock would be for it. Even among the pure\r\nEnglish, some talked bitterly of Majuba Hill, and declared they would\r\nnot fight to give the country back to Britain which had abandoned it in\r\n1881.\r\n\r\nThe motives of these Reformers were simple and patent. Those of them who\r\nhad been born and lived long in Africa thought it an intolerable wrong\r\nthat, whereas everywhere else in South Africa they could acquire the\r\nsuffrage and the means of influencing the government after two or three\r\nyears' residence, they were in the Transvaal condemned to a long\r\ndisability, and denied all voice in applying the taxes which they paid.\r\nThinking of South Africa as practically one country, they complained\r\nthat here, and here only, were they treated as aliens and inferiors.\r\nBoth they and all the other Uitlanders had substantial grievances to\r\nredress. Food was inordinately dear, because a high tariff had been\r\nimposed on imports. Water-supply, police, sanitation, were all\r\nneglected. Not only was Dutch the official language, but in the public\r\nschools Dutch was then the only medium of instruction; and English\r\nchildren were compelled to learn arithmetic, geography, and history out\r\nof Dutch text-books. It was these abuses, rather than any wish to bring\r\nthe Transvaal under the British flag, or even to establish a South\r\nAfrican Confederation, that disposed them to revolt against a Government\r\nwhich they despised.\r\n\r\nThe mine-owning capitalists were a very small class, but powerful by\r\ntheir wealth, their intelligence, and their influence over those whom\r\nthey employed. They had held aloof from the agitation which began in\r\n1892, because they did not themselves care for the franchise, not\r\nmeaning to spend their lives in the Transvaal, and because they knew\r\nthat political disturbances would interfere with the mining industry.\r\nThe leading man, and certainly one of the ablest men among them,[82]\r\nforesaw trouble as far back as June, 1894, when he wrote that the unrest\r\nof the country came \"from the open hostility of the Government to the\r\nUitlanders, and its hostility to all principles of sound Government; the\r\nend will be revolution;\" and a few weeks later wrote again: \"The mining\r\ncompanies ought to have arms. The courage of the Boers is exaggerated.\r\nIf they knew there were in Johannesburg three thousand well-armed men,\r\nthey would not talk so loud of destroying the town.\" Nevertheless, these\r\ncapitalists, like capitalists all over the world, disliked force, and\r\nlong refused to throw themselves into the movement. They raised a fund\r\nfor the purpose of trying \"to get a better Volksraad\"--whether by\r\ninfluencing members or by supplying funds for election expenses has\r\nnever been made clear. However, these efforts failed, and they became at\r\nlast convinced that the loss of their industry from misgovernment was,\r\nand would continue, greater than any loss which temporary disturbances\r\nmight involve. The vista of deep-level mining, which had now opened\r\nitself before them, made their grievances seem heavier. Before they\r\nentered on a new series of enterprises, which would at first be costly,\r\nthey wished to relieve mining from the intolerable burdens of a dynamite\r\nmonopoly, foolishly or corruptly granted to a firm which charged an\r\nextortionate price for this necessity; of a high tariff both on\r\nfood-stuffs, involving large expenses in feeding the workpeople, and on\r\nmine machinery; of extravagantly heavy railway rates for coal; and of a\r\nsystem which, by making it easy for the Kafir workers to get drunk,\r\nreduced the available amount of native labour by one-third, and\r\nincreased the number of accidents in the mines. These burdens made the\r\ndifference of one or two or three per cent, on the dividend in the best\r\nmines, threatened the prospect of any dividend on the second best, and\r\nmade it useless to persevere with the working of a third class, where\r\nthe ore was of a still lower grade. Such were the considerations which\r\nat last determined several of the leading mine-owners to throw in their\r\nlot with the Reform party; and the fusion of the two streams gave a new\r\nforce to the movement. This fusion took place in the middle of 1895, and\r\nhad become known to many, though not to all, of the Johannesburgers in\r\nNovember of that year. It inspired them with fresh hopes, and made them\r\nthink that the day of action was near. The object of these capitalists\r\nwas to obtain better government, not the extinction of the Republic, or\r\nits addition to the territories of Britain. This, however, was not the\r\nmain object of Mr. Rhodes (then prime minister of Cape Colony and\r\nmanaging director of the British South Africa Company), with whom they\r\nwere (though the fact was known only to a very few of the leaders) by\r\nthis time in communication. Although he was largely interested in some\r\nof the mines, his aim was, as even his opponents have now admitted, not\r\na pecuniary one. It was (as is generally believed) to prevent the\r\nTransvaal from passing under anti-British influences, and to secure that\r\nit should ultimately become incorporated in a confederation of the\r\nseveral States and Colonies of South Africa under the British Crown.\r\nThere were probably others among the leaders who shared this purpose;\r\nbut some did not, and here was a question which would seem to have\r\ndivided the chiefs as it divided the rank and file. A rising there was\r\nto be. But under what flag? This vital point was left unsettled, and at\r\nthe last moment it caused a fatal delay.\r\n\r\nThe third class of Uitlanders consisted of the white workmen. It was the\r\nmost numerous class, and its action would evidently be decisive. When\r\nthe visitor who heard the situation discussed--for there was no secrecy\r\nobserved--asked about the attitude of the working men, he received no\r\nvery definite answer. The general belief was that they would respond to\r\na call to arms; some from patriotism, because most of them were\r\nEnglishmen and Australians; some because they meant to make the\r\nTransvaal their home, and had an interest in good government; some from\r\nsympathy with their employers; some from the love of a fight, because\r\nthey were men of mettle. One or two of the Reform leaders were able\r\nspeakers, and meant to rouse them by eloquence when the proper moment\r\narrived. The result showed that a majority--that is, of the\r\nEnglish-speaking workmen--were willing to fight. But when the day of\r\nbattle seemed to be at hand, many, including most of the Cornish miners,\r\nproved to be indifferent, and departed by train amid the jeers of their\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nThese three sections of Uitlanders constituted a numerical majority not\r\nmerely of the dwellers on the Rand, but of the whole white population of\r\nthe country.[83] There are about 65,000 Boers, all told, and about\r\n24,000 male citizens over the age of sixteen. The English-speaking\r\nUitlanders numbered nearly 100,000, of whom fully one-half were adult\r\nmales. Seven-eighths of these were gathered on the Rand. Had they been\r\narmed and drilled and unanimous, they would have been irresistible. But\r\nthey were not unanimous, and were, moreover, not only unarmed but also\r\nunorganized, being a crowd of persons suddenly gathered from the four\r\nwinds of heaven.\r\n\r\nOver against the Uitlanders stood the native Boer population, among whom\r\nwe must distinguish two classes. The majority, consisting of the old\r\n\"true blues,\" who hated the British Government and clung to their\r\nnational ways, supported the Boer Government in its stubborn refusal to\r\ngrant reforms. The President in particular had repeatedly declared\r\nhimself against any concession, insisting that no concessions would\r\nsatisfy the disaffected. He looked upon the whole movement as a scheme\r\nto destroy the independence of the country and hand it over to England.\r\nExercising by his constant harangues in the Volksraad, what has been\r\ncalled a \"dictatorship of persuasion\", he warned the people that their\r\ncustoms, their freedom, their religion, were at stake, and could be\r\nsaved only by keeping the newcomers out of power. He was confirmed in\r\nthis policy of resistance by the advice of his Hollander officials, and\r\nespecially of the State Secretary, an able and resolute man.\r\n\r\nBut the President, though powerful, was not omnipotent. There existed a\r\nconsiderable party opposed to him, which had nearly overthrown him at\r\nthe last preceding presidential election. There was in the Volksraad a\r\nliberal minority, which advocated reforms. There were among the country\r\nBoers a number of moderate men who disliked the Hollander influence and\r\nthe maladministration of the Government, and one was told (though with\r\nwhat truth I could not ascertain) that the trekking which went on out of\r\nthe Transvaal into Mashonaland and to the far north-west was partly due\r\nto this discontent. There was also much opposition among the legal\r\nprofession, Dutch as well as English, for attacks had been made upon the\r\nindependence of the judiciary, and the reckless conduct of legislation\r\ngave displeasure. So far back as 1894 the Chief Justice, a man greatly\r\nrespected for his abilities and his services to the State, had delivered\r\na public address warning the people against the dangers which threatened\r\nthem from neglect of the provisions of the constitution. Whether this\r\nparty of opposition among the enfranchised citizens would have aided the\r\nReform movement was doubtful. They would certainly not have done so had\r\nthe British flag been raised. But if the movement had sought only the\r\ndestruction of Hollander influence and the redress of grievances, they\r\nwould at any rate have refused to join in resisting it.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" it may be asked--\"why, under these circumstances, with so many\r\nopen enemies, and so many wavering supporters, did not President Kruger\r\nbow to the storm and avert revolt by reasonable concessions?\" He had not\r\na friend in the world except Germany, which had gone out of her way to\r\noffer him sympathy. But Germany was distant, and he had no seaport. The\r\npeople of the Orange Free State had been ready to help the Transvaal in\r\n1881, and from among the Boers of Cape Colony there might in the crisis\r\nof that year have come substantial succour. But both the Free State and\r\nthe Cape Boers had been alienated by the unfriendly attitude of the\r\nPresident in commercial matters and by his refusal to employ Cape\r\nDutchmen in the Transvaal service. The annoyance of these kindred\r\ncommunities had been very recently accentuated by a dispute about the\r\ndrifts (_i.e._, fords where waggons cross) on the Orange River. It was\r\ntherefore improbable that any help could be obtained from outside\r\nagainst a purely internal movement, which aimed solely at reform, and\r\ndid not threaten the life of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the question just put is to be found not so much in the\r\nmaterial interests as in the sentiments of the old Boer party. They\r\nextended their hatred of the English, or rather perhaps of the British\r\nGovernment, to the English-speaking Uitlanders generally, and saw in the\r\nwhole movement nothing but an English plot. If the President had cared\r\nto distinguish, he might have perceived that the capitalists cared, not\r\nfor the franchise, but for the success of their mines; and he might, by\r\nabolishing the wasteful concessions,--which did not even enrich the\r\nState, but only the objects of its ill-directed bounty,--by reducing the\r\ntariff, and by keeping drink from the blacks, have disarmed the\r\nhostility of the mine owners, and have had only the National Union to\r\ndeal with. Even the National Union would have lost most of its support\r\nif he had reformed the administration and allowed English to be used in\r\nthe schools. He might have taken a hint from the Romans, who, when they\r\nadmitted a large body of new citizens, managed to restrict their voting\r\npower, and might, in granting the suffrage to those who had resided for\r\na certain period on the Rand, have kept the representation of the Rand\r\ndistrict so small that it could not turn the balance against the old\r\nBoer party in the Volksraad. Had he gone further, and extended the\r\nfranchise to all immigrants after, say, five years' residence, he might\r\nnot only have disarmed opposition, but have made the South African\r\nRepublic a powerful State, no considerable section of whose inhabitants\r\nwould thereafter have thought of putting themselves under the British\r\nCrown. To have gone this length would no doubt have been to take the\r\nrisk that a Republic of Boers might become before long a Republic of\r\nEnglishmen, with an English President; and from this he naturally\r\nrecoiled, not merely out of personal ambition, but out of honest\r\nnational feeling. But short of this, he might, by dividing his enemies,\r\nhave averted a grave peril, from which he was in the end delivered, not\r\nby his own strength, but by the mistakes of his antagonists. However, he\r\nkept the ship steadily on her course. He had grown accustomed to the\r\ncomplaints of the agitators, and thought they would not go beyond\r\nagitation. When pressed to take some repressive measure, he answered\r\nthat you must wait for the tortoise to put its head out before you hit\r\nit, and he appeared to think it would keep its head in. He is one of the\r\nmost interesting figures of our time; this old President, shrewd, cool,\r\ndogged, wary, courageous; typifying the qualities of his people, and\r\nstrong because he is in sympathy with them; adding to his trust in\r\nProvidence no small measure of worldly craft; uneducated, but able to\r\nfoil the statesmen of Europe at their own weapons, and perhaps all the\r\nmore capable because his training has been wholly that of an eventful\r\nlife and not of books.\r\n\r\nThis was how things stood in the Transvaal in November, 1895. People\r\nhave talked of a conspiracy, but never before was there, except on the\r\nstage,[84] so open a conspiracy. Two-thirds of the action--there was\r\nanother third, which has only subsequently become known--went on before\r\nthe public. The visitor had hardly installed himself in an hotel at\r\nPretoria before people began to tell him that an insurrection was\r\nimminent, that arms were being imported, that Maxim guns were hidden,\r\nand would be shown to him if he cared to see them, an invitation which\r\nhe did not feel called on to accept. In Johannesburg little else was\r\ntalked of, not in dark corners, but at the club where everybody lunches,\r\nand between the acts at the play. There was something humorous in\r\nhearing the English who dominate in so many other places, talking of\r\nthemselves as a downtrodden nationality, and the Boers as their\r\noppressors, declaring that misgovernment could not be endured for ever,\r\nand that those who would be free themselves must strike the blow. The\r\neffect was increased by the delightful unconsciousness of the English\r\nthat similar language is used in Ireland to denounce Saxon tyranny. The\r\nknowledge that an insurrection was impending was not confined to the\r\nTransvaal. All over South Africa one heard the same story; all over\r\nSouth Africa men waited for news from Johannesburg, though few expected\r\nthe explosion to come so soon. One thing alone was not even guessed at.\r\nIn November it did not seem to have crossed any one's mind that the\r\nBritish South Africa Company would have any hand in the matter. Had it\r\nbeen supposed that it was concerned, much of the sympathy which the\r\nmovement received would have vanished.\r\n\r\nAs I am not writing a history of the revolution, but merely describing\r\nthe Johannesburg aspects of its initial stage, I need not attempt the\r\ntask--for which, indeed, no sufficient materials have as yet been given\r\nto the world--of explaining by what steps and on what terms the\r\nCompany's managing director and its administrator and its police came\r\ninto the plan. But it seems probable that the Johannesburg leaders did\r\nnot begin to count upon help from the Company's force before the middle\r\nof 1895 at earliest, and that they did not regard that force as anything\r\nmore than an ultimate resource in case of extreme need. Knowing that the\r\ngreat body of the Uitlanders, on whose support they counted, would be\r\nunorganised and leaderless, they desired, as the moment for action\r\napproached, to have a military nucleus round which their raw levies\r\nmight gather, in case the Boers seemed likely to press them hard. But\r\nthis was an afterthought. When the movement began it was a purely\r\nJohannesburg movement, and it was intended to bear that character to the\r\nend, and to avoid all appearance of being an English irruption.[85]\r\n\r\nTo the visitor who saw and heard what I have been describing--and no\r\nEnglishman could pass through without seeing and hearing it--two\r\nquestions naturally presented themselves. One related to the merits of\r\nthe case. This was a question which only a visitor considered, for the\r\ninhabitants were drawn by race or interest to one side or the other. It\r\nraised a point often debated by moralists: What are the circumstances\r\nwhich justify insurrection? Some cases are too clear for argument.\r\nObviously any subject of a bloodthirsty tyrant ruling without or against\r\nlaw is justified in taking up arms. No one doubts that the Christian\r\nsubjects of the Sultan ought to rebel if they had a prospect of success;\r\nand those who try to make them rebel are blamed only because the\r\nprospect of success is wanting. On the other hand, it is clear that\r\nsubjects of a constitutional Government, conducted in accordance with\r\nlaw, do wrong and must be punished, if they take arms, even when they\r\nhave grievances to redress. Here, however, was a case which seemed to\r\nlie between the extreme instances. The Uitlanders, it need hardly be\r\nsaid, did not concern themselves with nice distinctions. In the interior\r\nof South Africa Governments and Constitutions were still in a\r\nrudimentary stage; nor had the habit of obeying them been fully formed.\r\nSo many non-legal things had been done in a high-handed way, and so many\r\nraids into native territories had been made by the Boers themselves,\r\nthat the sort of respect for legality which Europeans feel was still\r\nimperfectly developed in all sections of the population. Those of the\r\nReformers, however, who sought to justify their plans, argued that the\r\nBoer Government was an oligarchy which overtaxed its subjects, and yet\r\nrefused them those benefits which a civilised Government is bound to\r\ngive. It was the Government of a small and ignorant minority, and, since\r\nthey believed it to be corrupt as well as incompetent, it inspired no\r\nrespect. Peaceful agitation had proved useless. Did not the sacred\r\nprinciple of no taxation without representation, which had been held to\r\njustify the American Revolution, justify those who had been patient so\r\nlong in trying to remove their grievances by force, of course with as\r\nlittle effusion of blood as possible?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there was much to be said for the Boers, not only\r\nfrom the legal, but from the sentimental, side of the case. They had\r\nfled out of Cape Colony sixty years before, had suffered many perils and\r\ntriumphed over many foes, had recovered their independence by their own\r\ncourage when Britain had deprived them of it, had founded a commonwealth\r\nupon their own lines and could now keep it as their own only by the\r\nexclusion of those aliens in blood, speech and manners who had recently\r\ncome among them. They had not desired these strangers, nor had the\r\nstrangers come for anything but gold. True, they had opened the land to\r\nthem, they had permitted them to buy the gold-reefs, they had filled\r\ntheir coffers with the taxes which the miners paid. But the strangers\r\ncame with notice that it was a Boer State they were entering, and most\r\nof them had come, not to stay, and to identify themselves with the old\r\ncitizens, but to depart after amassing gain. Were these immigrants of\r\nyesterday to be suffered to overturn the old Boer State, and build up on\r\nits ruins a new one under which the Boer would soon find his cherished\r\ncustoms gone and himself in turn a stranger? Had not the English many\r\nother lands to rule, without appropriating this one also? Put the\r\ngrievances of which the Uitlanders complained at their highest, and they\r\ndid not amount to wrongs such as had in other countries furnished the\r\nusual pretext for insurrection. Life, religion, property, personal\r\nfreedom, were not at stake. The worst any one suffered was to be\r\novertaxed and to want some of those advantages which the old citizens\r\nhad never possessed and did not care to have. These were hardships, but\r\nwere they hardships such as could justify a recourse to arms?\r\n\r\nThe other question which an observer asked himself was whether an\r\ninsurrection would succeed. Taking a cooler view of the position than it\r\nwas easy for a resident to take, he felt some doubt on this point, and\r\nit occurred to him to wonder whether, if the Government was really so\r\ncorrupt as the Uitlanders described it, the latter might not attain\r\ntheir object more cheaply, as well as peaceably, by using those\r\narguments which were said to prevail with many members of the Volksraad.\r\nSupposing this to be impossible,--and it may well have been found\r\nimpossible, for men not scrupulous in lesser matters may yet refuse to\r\ntamper with what they hold vital,--were the forces at the disposal of\r\nthe Reform leaders sufficient to overthrow the Government? It had only\r\ntwo or three hundred regular troops, artillerymen stationed at Pretoria,\r\nand said to be not very efficient. But the militia included all Boers\r\nover sixteen; and the Boer, though not disciplined in the European way,\r\nwas accustomed to shoot, inured to hardships by his rough life, ready to\r\nfight to the death for his independence. This militia, consisting of\r\neighteen thousand men or more, would have been, when all collected, more\r\nthan a match in the field for any force the Uitlanders were prepared to\r\narm. And in point of fact, when the rising took place, the latter had\r\nonly some three thousand rifles ready, while few of their supporters\r\nknew anything of fighting. As the Reform leaders were aware that they\r\nwould be out-matched if the Government had time to gather its troops, it\r\nhas been subsequently hinted that they meant to carry Pretoria by a\r\n_coup de main_, capturing the President, and forthwith, before the Boer\r\nmilitia could assemble, to issue a call for a general popular vote or\r\nplebiscite of all the inhabitants, Boers and Uitlanders, which should\r\ndetermine the future form of government. Others have thought that the\r\nReformers would not have taken the offensive, but have entrenched\r\nthemselves in Johannesburg, and have held out there, appealing meanwhile\r\nto the High Commissioner, as representative of the Paramount Power, to\r\ncome up, interpose his mediation, and arrange for the peaceable taking\r\nof such a general popular vote as I have mentioned. To do this it might\r\nnot have been necessary to defend the town for more than a week or ten\r\ndays, before which time the general sympathy which they expected from\r\nthe rest of South Africa would have made itself felt. Besides, there\r\nwere in the background (though this was of course unknown to the visitor\r\nand to all but a few among the leaders) the British South Africa\r\nCompany's police force by this time beginning to gather at Pitsani, who\r\nwere pledged to come if summoned, and whose presence would have enabled\r\nthem to resist a Boer assault on the town.\r\n\r\nAs everybody knows, the question of strength was never tested. The\r\nrising was to have been ushered in by a public meeting at the end of\r\nDecember. This meeting was postponed till the 6th of January; but the\r\nCompany's police force, instead of waiting to be summoned, started for\r\nJohannesburg at the time originally fixed. Their sudden entrance, taking\r\nthe Reform leaders by surprise and finding them unprepared, forced the\r\nmovement to go off at half-cock, and gave to it an aspect quite\r\ndifferent from that which it had hitherto borne. That which had been a\r\nlocal agitation now appeared in the light of an English invasion, roused\r\nall the Boers, of whatever party, to defend their country, and drew from\r\nthe High Commissioner an emphatic disclaimer and condemnation of the\r\nexpedition, which the home Government repeated. The rising at\r\nJohannesburg, which the entrance of the police had precipitated, ended\r\nmore quickly than it had begun, as soon as the surrender of the\r\nCompany's forces had become known, for the representatives of the High\r\nCommissioner besought the Uitlanders to lay down their arms and save\r\nthe lives of the leaders of that force.[86] This they did, and, after\r\nwhat had happened, there was really nothing else to be done.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious moral of the failure is the old one, that revolutions\r\nare not so easy to carry out as they look when one plans them\r\nbeforehand. Of all the insurrections and conspiracies recorded in\r\nhistory, probably not five per cent. have succeeded. The reason is that\r\nwhen a number of private persons not accustomed to joint action have to\r\nact secretly together, unable to communicate freely with one another,\r\nand still less able to appeal beforehand to those on whose eventual\r\nsupport they rely, the chances of disagreement, of misunderstanding, of\r\nfailure to take some vital step at exactly the right moment, are\r\ninnumerable; while the Government in power has the advantage of\r\nunited counsels, and can issue orders to officers who are\r\nhabituated to prompt obedience.[87] In this instance, the plan was being\r\nconducted by three groups of persons in three places distant from one\r\nanother,--Johannesburg, Pitsani, and Cape Town,--so that the chances of\r\nmiscarriage were immensely increased. Had there been one directing mind\r\nand will planted at Johannesburg, the proper centre for direction, the\r\nmovement might have proved successful.\r\n\r\nAnother reflection will have occurred to the reader, as it occurred to\r\nthe visitor who saw the storm brewing in November, 1895: Why could not\r\nthe Reformers have waited a little longer? Time was on their side. The\r\nUitlanders were rapidly growing by the constant stream of immigrants. In\r\na few years more they would have so enormously outnumbered the native\r\nBoers that not only would their material strength have been formidable,\r\nbut their claim to the franchise would have become practically\r\nirresistible. Moreover, President Kruger was an old man, no longer in\r\nstrong health. When age and infirmity compelled his retirement, neither\r\nof the persons deemed most likely to succeed would have thrown obstacles\r\nin the way of reform, nor would any successor have been able to oppose a\r\nresistance as strong as Mr. Kruger's had proved. These considerations\r\nwere so obvious that one asks why, with the game in their hands at the\r\nend of a few years, the various groups concerned did not wait quietly\r\ntill the ripe fruit fell into their mouths. Different causes have been\r\nassigned for their action. It is said that they believed that the\r\nTransvaal Government was on the eve of entering into secret relations,\r\nin violation of the Convention of 1884, with a European Power, and that\r\nthis determined them to strike before any such new complication arose.\r\nOthers hint that some of those concerned believed that a revolution must\r\nin any case soon break out in the Transvaal, that a revolution would\r\nturn the country into an independent English Republic, that such a\r\nrepublic would spread Republican feelings among the British Colonies,\r\nand lead before long to their separation from the mother country. To\r\nprevent this, they were resolved to take control of the movement and\r\nsteer it away from those rocks. Without denying that these or other\r\nstill more conjectural motives which one hears assigned may have\r\ninfluenced some of the more long-sighted leaders,--and the Transvaal,\r\nwith its vast wealth and growing population, was no doubt becoming the\r\ncentre of gravity in South African politics,--I conceive that a more\r\nobvious cause of haste may be found in the impatience of those Uitlander\r\nresidents who were daily vexed by grievances for which they could get no\r\nredress, and in the annoyance of the capitalists, who saw their mining\r\ninterests languishing and the work of development retarded. When people\r\nhave long talked over their wrongs and long planned schemes for throwing\r\noff a detested yoke, they yield at last to their own impatience, feeling\r\nhalf ashamed that so much talk should not have been followed by action.\r\n\r\nWhatever were the motives at work, whatever the ultimate aims of the\r\nleaders, few things could have been more deplorable than what in fact\r\noccurred. Since the annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 nothing has done\r\nso much to rekindle racial hostility in South Africa; nothing has so\r\nmuch retarded and still impedes the settlement of questions which were\r\nalready sufficiently difficult.\r\n\r\nI have described in this chapter only such part of the circumstances\r\nwhich led up to the rising as I actually saw, and have, for reasons\r\nalready stated, confined myself to a narrative of the main facts, and a\r\nstatement of the theories put forward, abstaining from comments on the\r\nconduct of individuals. The expedition of the British South Africa\r\nCompany's police took place after I left the country. Of it and of what\r\nled to it oral accounts have been given by some of the principal actors,\r\nas well as by many independent pens, while the visible phenomena of the\r\nJohannesburg movement have been less described and are certainly less\r\nunderstood. I have dwelt on them the more fully not only because they\r\nare a curious episode in history which will not soon lose its interest,\r\nbut also because the political and industrial situation on the\r\nWitwatersrand remained in 1897 substantially what it was in November\r\n1895. Some few reforms have been given, some others promised. But the\r\nmine owners did not cease to complain, and the Uitlanders were excluded\r\nfrom the suffrage as rigorously as ever. The Transvaal difficulty\r\nremained, and still disturbed the tranquillity of South Africa. The\r\nproblem is not a simple one, and little or no progress had been made\r\ntowards its solution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Since the first edition of this book appeared, Mr. Selous\r\nhas told me--and no one's authority is higher, for he has lived much\r\namongst them--that this statement is exaggerated, and that, great as has\r\nbeen and is the dislike of the Boers to the British Government, the\r\naverage Boer is friendly to the individual Englishman.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: I was told that their frequent term (when they talk among\r\nthemselves) for an Englishman is \"rotten egg,\" but some persons who had\r\nopportunities of knowing have informed me, since this book was first\r\npublished, that this is not so. Another common Boer name for an\r\nEnglishman is \"red-neck,\" drawn from the fact that the back of an\r\nEnglishman's neck is often burnt red by the sun. This does not happen to\r\nthe Boer, who always wears a broad-brimmed hat.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Their laws at one time forbade the working of gold mines\r\naltogether, for they held with the Roman poet (_aurum inrepertum et sic\r\nmelius situm_) that it does least harm when undiscovered.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: I have elsewhere analysed (in the _Forum_ for April, 1896)\r\nthis constitution, and discussed the question whether it is to be\r\nregarded as a true Rigid constitution, like that of the United States,\r\nof the Swiss Confederation, and of the Orange Free State, or as a\r\nFlexible constitution, alterable by the ordinary legislative machinery.\r\nFurther examination of the matter has confirmed me in the view there\r\nsuggested, that the constitution belongs to the latter category.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Copies of the letters written by Mr. Lionel Phillips were\r\nseized after the rising and published by the Boer Government.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: There were some 700,000 Kafirs in the Transvaal, but no\r\none reckoned them as possible factors in a contest, any more than sheep\r\nor oxen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: This operatic element appeared in the rising itself, when\r\na fire-escape, skilfully disguised to resemble a Maxim gun, was moved\r\nbackward and forward across the stage at Johannesburg for the purpose of\r\nfrightening the Boers at a distance.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: It is hardly necessary to point out the absurdity of the\r\nsuggestion that the Company intended to seize the Transvaal for itself.\r\nThe Company could no more have taken the Transvaal than it could have\r\ntaken Natal. It was for self-government that the insurgent-Uitlanders\r\nwere to rise, and they would have objected to be governed by the Company\r\nat least as much as they objected to be governed by the Boers. Such\r\nindividual members of the Company as held Rand mining shares would have\r\nprofited by the better administration of the country under a reformed\r\nGovernment, but they would have profited in exactly the same way as\r\nshareholders in Paris or Amsterdam. This point, obvious enough to any\r\none who knows South Africa, is clearly put by M. Mermeix, in his\r\ninteresting little book, _La Révolution de Johannesburg_. Other fanciful\r\nhypotheses have been put forward, which it seems needless to notice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Much controversy has arisen as to the promise which the\r\nBoer commandant made, when the police force surrendered, that the lives\r\nof its leaders should be spared. Whatever might have happened\r\nimmediately after the surrender, they would in any case not have been\r\nput to death in cold blood at Pretoria, for that would have been a\r\nblunder, which a man so astute and so far from cruel as the President\r\nwould not have committed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: When a conspiracy succeeds, the chief conspirator is\r\nusually some one already wielding some civil or military power, as Louis\r\nNapoleon did when he overcame the French Assembly in 1851.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC FUTURE OF SOUTH AFRICA\r\n\r\n\r\nThough I do not attempt to present in this book an account of the\r\nagricultural and mineral resources of South Africa, some words must be\r\nsaid regarding its economic prospects--that is to say, regarding the\r\nnatural sources of wealth which it possesses, their probable\r\ndevelopment, and the extent to which that development will increase the\r\nstill scanty population. The political and social future of the country\r\nmust so largely depend on its economic future that any one who desires\r\nto comprehend those political problems to the solution of which the\r\npeople are moving, must first consider what sort of a people, and how\r\nlarge a people, the material conditions which nature furnishes are\r\nlikely to produce.\r\n\r\nThe chief charm of travel through a new country is the curiosity which\r\nthe thought of its future inspires. In South Africa, a land singularly\r\nunlike any part of Europe or of North America, this curiosity is keenly\r\nfelt by the visitor. When he begins to speculate on the future, his\r\nfirst question is, Will these wildernesses ever become peopled, as most\r\nof North America and a large part of Australia have now been peopled,\r\nand if so, what will be the character of the population? Will South\r\nAfrica become one of the great producing or manufacturing countries of\r\nthe world? Will it furnish a great market for European goods? Will it be\r\npopulous enough and rich enough to grow into one of the Powers of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere?\r\n\r\nLet us begin by recalling the physical features of the country. Most of\r\nit is high and dry; all of it is hot. The parts which are high and dry\r\nare also healthy, and fit for the races of Europe to dwell in. But are\r\nthey equally fit to support a dense population?\r\n\r\nSouth Africa has three great natural sources of wealth: agricultural\r\nland, pasture-land, and minerals. The forests are too scanty to be worth\r\nregarding: they are not, and probably never will be, sufficient to\r\nsupply its own needs. Fisheries also are insignificant, and not likely\r\never to constitute an industry, so we may confine ourselves to the three\r\nfirst named.\r\n\r\nOf these three agriculture is now, and has hitherto been, by far the\r\nleast important. Out of an area of two hundred and twenty-one thousand\r\nsquare miles in Cape Colony alone, probably not more than one\r\none-thousandth part is now under any kind of cultivation, whether by\r\nnatives or by whites; and in the whole country, even if we exclude the\r\nGerman and Portuguese territories, the proportion must be even smaller.\r\nThere are no figures available, so one can make only the roughest\r\npossible conjecture. As regards more than half of the country, this fact\r\nis explained by the dryness of the climate. Not only the Karroo region\r\nin the interior of Cape Colony, but also the vast region stretching\r\nnorth from the Karroo nearly as far as the west-coast territories of\r\nPortugal, is too arid for tillage. So are large parts of the Free State,\r\nof the Transvaal, and of Matabililand. Where there is a sufficient\r\nrainfall, as in many districts along the south and south-east coasts,\r\nmuch of the country is too hilly and rough for cultivation; so that it\r\nwould be well within the mark to say that of the whole area mentioned\r\nabove far less than one-tenth is suitable for raising any kind of crop\r\nwithout artificial aid. Much, no doubt, remains which might be tilled,\r\nand is not tilled, especially in the country between the south-eastern\r\nedge of the great plateau and the sea; and that this land lies untouched\r\nis due partly to the presence of the Kafir tribes, who occupy more land\r\nthan they cultivate, partly to the want or the dearness of labour,\r\npartly to the tendency, confirmed by long habit, of the whites to prefer\r\nstock-farming to tillage. The chief agricultural products are at present\r\ncereals, _i.e._, wheat, oats, maize, and Kafir corn (a kind of millet),\r\nfruit and sugar. The wheat and maize raised are not sufficient for the\r\nconsumption of the inhabitants, so that these articles are largely\r\nimported, in spite of the duties levied on them. There is a considerable\r\nand an increasing export of fruit, which goes to Europe,--chiefly to the\r\nEnglish market--in January, February, and March, the midsummer and\r\nautumn of the southern hemisphere. Sugar is grown on the hot lands of\r\nNatal lying along the sea, and might, no doubt, be grown all the way\r\nnorth along the sea from there to the Zambesi. Rice would do well on the\r\nwet coast lands, but is scarcely at all raised. Tea has lately been\r\nplanted on the hills in Natal, and would probably thrive also on the\r\nhigh lands of Mashonaland. There is plenty of land fit for cotton. The\r\ntobacco of the Transvaal is so pleasant for smoking in a pipe that one\r\ncannot but expect it to be in time much more largely and carefully grown\r\nthan it is now. Those who have grown accustomed to it prefer it to any\r\nother. With the exception of the olive, which apparently does not\r\nsucceed, and of the vine, which succeeds only in the small district\r\nround Cape Town that enjoys a true summer and winter, nearly all the\r\nstaples of the warmer parts of the temperate zone and of subtropical\r\nregions can be grown in some district or other of the country.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of irrigation would enormously enlarge the area of\r\ntillage, for some of the regions now hopelessly arid, such as the\r\nKarroo, have a soil of surprising fertility, which produces luxuriant\r\ncrops when water is led on to it. Millions of acres might be made to\r\nwave with corn were great tanks, like those of India, constructed to\r\nhold the rains of the wet season, for it is not so much the inadequacy\r\nof the rainfall as the fact that it is confined to three or four months,\r\nthat makes the country arid. Something might also be hoped from the\r\ndigging of artesian wells dug like those which have lately been\r\nsuccessfully bored in Algeria, and have proved so infinitely valuable to\r\nparts of Australia. Already about three hundred thousand acres are\r\ncultivated with the aid of irrigation in Cape Colony. At present,\r\nhowever, it has been deemed hardly worth while to execute large\r\nirrigation works or to bore wells.[88] The price of cereals has sunk so\r\nlow over all the world that South Africans find it cheaper to import\r\nthem than to spend capital on breaking up waste lands; and there is\r\nplenty of land already which might be cultivated without irrigation if\r\nthere were settlers coming to cultivate it, or if Kafir labour was\r\nsufficiently effective to make it worth the while of enterprising men to\r\nundertake farming on a large scale. The same remarks apply generally to\r\nthe other kinds of produce I have mentioned. As population grows, and\r\nthe local demand for food increases, more land will be brought under the\r\nplough or the hoe. Some day, perhaps, when the great corn-exporting\r\ncountries of to-day--North America, La Plata, central India, southern\r\nRussia--have become so populous as to have much less of their grain\r\ncrops to spare for other countries, it will become profitable to\r\nirrigate the Karroo, on which the Kafir of the future will probably\r\nprove a more efficient labourer than he is now. But that day is distant,\r\nand until it arrives, agriculture will continue to play a very\r\nsubordinate part in South African industry, and will employ a\r\ncomparatively small white population.\r\n\r\nEver since the last years of the seventeenth century, when the settlers\r\nwere beginning to spread out from the Cape Peninsula towards the then\r\nstill unknown interior, the main occupation of the colonists, first of\r\nthe Dutch and afterwards of both Dutch and English, has been the keeping\r\nof cattle and sheep. So it remains to-day. Nearly all the land that is\r\nnot rough mountain or waterless desert, and much that to the\r\ninexperienced eye seems a waterless desert, is in the hands of\r\nstock-farmers, whose ranges are often of enormous size, from six\r\nthousand acres upward. In 1893 there were in Cape Colony about 2,000,000\r\ncattle, in Natal 725,000, in the Orange Free State 900,000, and in\r\nBechuanaland the Bamangwato (Khama's tribe) alone had 800,000. Of these\r\nlast only some 5,000 are said to have survived the murrain, which worked\r\nhavoc in the other three first-mentioned territories also. In 1896 there\r\nwere in Cape Colony alone 14,400,000 sheep and 5,000,000 Angora and\r\nother goats. The number of sheep might be largely increased were more\r\neffective measures against the diseases that affect them carried out.\r\nAll the country, even the Kalahari desert, which used to be thought\r\nhopelessly sterile, is now deemed fit to put some sort of live stock\r\nupon, though, of course, the more arid the soil, the greater the area\r\nrequired to feed one sheep. To the traveller who crosses its weary\r\nstretches in the train, the Karroo seems a barren waste; but it produces\r\nsmall succulent shrubs much relished by sheep, and every here and there\r\na well or a stagnant pool may be found which supplies water enough to\r\nkeep the creatures alive. Here six acres is the average allowed for one\r\nsheep. Tracts of rough ground, covered with patches of thick scrubby\r\nbushes, are turned to account as ostrich farms, whence large quantities\r\nof feathers are exported to Europe and America. In 1896 the number of\r\nostriches in Cape Colony was returned as 225,000. The merino sheep,\r\nintroduced about seventy years ago, thrives in Cape Colony, and its wool\r\nhas become one of the most valuable products of the country. In the Free\r\nState both it and the Angora goat do well, and the pasture lands of that\r\nterritory support also great numbers of cattle and some horses. The Free\r\nState and Bechuanaland are deemed to be among the very best ranching\r\ngrounds in all South Africa.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as I have said, nearly all the country is more or less fit for\r\nlive stock, it must be remembered that this does not imply either great\r\npecuniary returns or a large population. In most districts a\r\ncomparatively wide area of ground is required to feed what would be\r\ndeemed in western America a moderate herd or flock, because the pasture\r\nis thin, droughts are frequent, and locusts sometimes destroy a large\r\npart of the herbage. Thus the number of persons for whom the care of\r\ncattle or sheep in any given area provides occupation is a mere trifle\r\ncompared to the number which would be needed to till the same area.\r\nArtesian wells might, no doubt, make certain regions better for pastoral\r\npurposes; but here, as in the case of agriculture, we find little\r\nprospect of any dense population, and, indeed, a probability that the\r\nwhite people will continue to be few relatively to the area of the\r\ncountry. On a large grazing farm the proportion of white men to black\r\nservants is usually about three to twenty-five; and though the\r\nproportion of whites is, of course, much larger in the small towns which\r\nsupply the wants of the surrounding country, still any one can see with\r\nhow few whites a ranching country may get along.\r\n\r\nThe third source of wealth lies in the minerals. It was the latest\r\nsource to become known--indeed, till thirty-two years ago, nobody\r\nsuspected it. Iron had been found in some places, copper in others; but\r\nneither had been largely worked, and the belief in the existence of the\r\nprecious metals rested on nothing more than a Portuguese tradition. In\r\n1867 the first diamond was picked up by a hunter out of a heap of\r\nshining pebbles near the banks of the Orange River, above its confluence\r\nwith the Vaal. In 1869-70 the stones began to be largely found near\r\nwhere the town of Kimberley now stands. This point has been henceforth\r\nthe centre of the industry, though there are a few other mines elsewhere\r\nof smaller productive power. The value of the present annual output\r\nexceeds £4,000,000, but it is not likely to increase, being, in fact,\r\nnow kept down in order not to depress the market by over-supply.\r\nAltogether more than £100,000,000 worth of diamonds have been exported.\r\nThe discovery of diamonds, as was observed in an earlier chapter, opened\r\na new period in South African history, drawing crowds of immigrants,\r\ndeveloping trade through the seaports as well as industry at the mining\r\ncentres, and producing a group of enterprising men who, when the various\r\ndiamond-mining companies had been amalgamated, sought and found new ways\r\nof employing their capital. Fifteen years after the great diamond finds\r\ncame the still greater gold finds at the Witwatersrand. The working of\r\nthese mines has now become the greatest industry in the country, and\r\nJohannesburg is the centre toward which the import trade converges.\r\n\r\nI need not repeat the description given in a previous chapter (Chapter\r\nXVIII) of the Rand mining district. The reader will remember that it\r\ndiffers from all the other gold-fields of South Africa in one essential\r\nfeature--that of the comparative certainty of its yield. Accordingly, in\r\nconsidering the future of South African gold, I will speak first of\r\nthose other gold-fields and then separately of the Rand district.\r\n\r\nGold has been found in many places south of the Zambesi. It occurs here\r\nand there in small quantities in Cape Colony, in somewhat larger\r\nquantities in Natal, Zululand, and Swaziland, in the eastern and\r\nnorth-eastern districts of the Transvaal, at Tati in northern\r\nBechuanaland, and in many spots through Matabililand and Mashonaland. In\r\nall (or nearly all) these places it occurs in quartz reefs resembling\r\nthose of North America and Australia. Some reefs, especially those of\r\nthe northern region between the Limpopo and Zambesi, are promising, and\r\ngreat quantities of gold have in times long past been taken out of this\r\nregion. As already explained (Chapter XVII), it seems probable, though\r\nnot certain, that in many districts a mining industry will be developed\r\nwhich will give employment to thousands, perhaps many thousands, of\r\nnatives, and to hundreds, perhaps many hundreds, of white engineers and\r\nforemen. Should this happen, markets will be created in these districts,\r\nland will be cultivated, railways will be made, and the local trades\r\nwhich a thriving population requires will spring up. But the life of\r\nthese gold reefs will not be a long one. As the gold is found in quartz\r\nrock, and only to a small extent in gravel or other alluvial deposits,\r\nthe mining requires capital, and will be carried on by companies. It\r\nwill be carried on quickly, and so quickly with the aid of the\r\nenormously improved scientific appliances we now possess, as to exhaust\r\nat no distant period the mineral which the rocks contain. I saw in\r\nTransylvania in 1866 a gold mine which was worked in the days of the\r\nRomans, and was being worked still. But mining now is as different from\r\nthe mining of the ancients or of the middle ages as a locomotive engine\r\nis from an ox-waggon, such are the resources which chemical and\r\nmechanical science place at our disposal. Accordingly, the payable parts\r\nof the quartz reefs will have been drained of their gold in a few years,\r\nor, at any rate, in a few decades, just as many of the silver lodes of\r\nNevada have already been worked out and abandoned. There will then be no\r\nfurther cause for the existence of the mine-workers at those points, and\r\nthe population will decline just as that of Nevada has declined. These\r\nSouth African districts will, however, be in one point far better off\r\nthan Nevada: they possess land fit everywhere for ranching, and in many\r\nplaces for tillage also. Ranching will, therefore, support a certain,\r\nthough not large, permanent population; while tillage, though the\r\nprofitable market close by will have been largely reduced by the\r\ndeparture of the miners, will probably continue, because the land will\r\nhave been furnished with farmhouses and fences, perhaps in places with\r\nirrigation works, and because the railways that will have been\r\nconstructed will enable agricultural products to reach more distant\r\nmarkets, which by that time may possibly be less glutted with the\r\ncereals of North and South America. Accordingly, assuming that a fair\r\nproportion of the quartz reef gold-fields turn out well, it may be\r\npredicted that population will increase in and round them during the\r\nnext ten years, and that for some twenty years more this population will\r\nmaintain itself, though of course not necessarily in the same spots,\r\nbecause, as the reefs first developed become exhausted, the miners will\r\nshift to new places. After these thirty or possibly forty years, that is\r\nto say, before the middle of next century, the country, having parted\r\nwith whatever gold it contains, will have to fall back on its pasture\r\nand its arable land; but having become settled and developed, it may\r\ncount on retaining a reasonable measure of prosperity.\r\n\r\nThis forecast may seem to be of a highly conjectural nature. Conjectural\r\nit must be, if only for this reason: that the value of most of the\r\nquartz reefs referred to is still quite uncertain. But one cannot visit\r\na new country without attempting to make a forecast of some kind; and\r\nthe experience of other countries goes to show that, while deposits of\r\nthe precious metals are, under our present conditions, no more an\r\nabiding source of wealth than is a guano island, they may immensely\r\naccelerate the development of a country, giving it a start in the world,\r\nand providing it with advantages, such as railway communication, which\r\ncould not otherwise be looked for. This they are now doing for\r\nMatabililand and Mashonaland, countries in which it would not at present\r\nbe worth while to construct railroads but for the hopes attaching to the\r\nmines. This they may do for Zululand and Swaziland also, should the\r\nreefs in those districts prove profitable.\r\n\r\nSo much for the quartz reefs. As has been observed, the gold mines of\r\nthe Witwatersrand differ in the much greater certainty of their yield\r\nand in the much greater quantity of auriferous rock which they have been\r\nascertained to contain. It is probable that gold of the value of\r\n£700,000,000 remains to be extracted from them. Already a population of\r\nat least 150,000 white men has collected in what was in 1885 a barren\r\nwilderness; already about £15,000,000 of gold per annum is being\r\nextracted. It is practically certain that this production and population\r\nwill go on increasing during the next few years, and that the mines will\r\nnot be worked out before the middle of next century at earliest. For the\r\nnext fifty years, therefore, the Rand district will be the economic and\r\nindustrial centre of South Africa and the seat of the largest European\r\ncommunity. What will it be after those fifty or perhaps sixty years,\r\nwhen the _banket_ beds have been drained of their gold to a depth of\r\n5,000 feet, the greatest at which mining seems to be practicable? It is\r\npossible that the other industries which are rising as ancillary to\r\nmining may for a while and to a reduced extent hold their ground.\r\nProbably, however, they will wither up and vanish. The land will remain,\r\nbut the land of this highest part of the Transvaal, though fit for\r\npasture, does not lend itself to tillage. The probabilities, therefore,\r\nare that the fate of Nevada will in time descend upon the\r\nWitwatersrand--that the houses that are now springing up will be\r\nsuffered to fall to ruin, that the mouths of the shafts will in time be\r\ncovered by thorny shrublets, and that soon after A.D. 2000 has been\r\nreached this busy hive of industry and noisy market-place of\r\nspeculation will have again become the stony solitude which it was in\r\n1880. For all practical purposes, however, an event a hundred years away\r\nis too distant to be worth regarding. The world will in A.D. 2000 be so\r\ndifferent from what it is now that the exhaustion of the Rand gold-field\r\nmay have a different bearing from any which we can now foresee.\r\nJohannesburgers themselves are not disquieted by thoughts of a future\r\nthat is even half a century distant. The older sort will not live to see\r\nit, and the younger sort expect to have made their fortunes long before\r\nit arrives. Still it must be remembered that, so far as minerals go,\r\nSouth Africa is now living, not on her income, but on her capital, and\r\nthat in twenty-five years half or more of the capital may be gone.\r\n\r\nThere are other metals in the country besides the precious ones. The\r\npresence of extensive coal-beds in the Transvaal and Natal has been a\r\ncircumstance of the first importance for the profitable working of the\r\nRand gold-beds, and may encourage the growth of some kinds of\r\nmanufacture.[89] Iron is abundant both in the Transvaal and in\r\nMashonaland, and has been found in many other districts, often in the\r\nneighbourhood of coal. It is not worked now, because all iron goods can\r\nbe obtained more cheaply from Europe; but it may one day grow into an\r\nindustry, as copper-mining already has in Little Namaqualand on the west\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe mention of coal and iron brings us to another branch of the\r\nsubject--the possibility of establishing manufactures which may become a\r\nsource of wealth and the support of an industrial population. At present\r\nthe manufactures are insignificant. All the textile goods, for instance,\r\nnearly all the metal goods, and by far the larger part even of the beer\r\nand spirits (intended for the whites) and mineral waters consumed in\r\nthe country come from Europe. The Boers in the two Republics and the\r\nBoer element at the Cape have neither taste nor talent for this kind of\r\nindustry, and such capital as exists is naturally attracted to mining\r\nenterprises. Nevertheless, it may be thought that as capital accumulates\r\nthings will change, and that the English part of the population in the\r\ntwo British Colonies will take to manufactures, as it has done in\r\nAustralia. Let us see whether this is probable.\r\n\r\nTo enable South African manufacturers to compete on a large scale with\r\nthe established manufacturing countries, such as those in north-western\r\nEurope or north-eastern America, three things are needed--a large\r\nmarket, cheap sources of mechanical power, cheap and efficient labour.\r\nOf these the first is at present wanting, and even should the growth of\r\nthe Rand mining district raise the white population of the two Colonies\r\nand two Republics from something over 700,000 to 1,200,000, that number\r\nof consumers will still be too small to encourage the expenditure of any\r\nlarge capital in endeavouring to produce articles which the immense\r\nmanufacturing establishments of Europe, working for populous markets,\r\ncan turn out more cheaply. As to mechanical forces, there are no rivers\r\nto give water-power; and though Natal, Zululand, and the Transvaal\r\nprovide coal, the quality of the mineral is inferior to that obtainable\r\nin South Wales or Belgium or Pennsylvania. But the most important\r\nconditions for success are those connected with labour. In South Africa\r\nskilled labour is dear because scarce, and unskilled labour is dear\r\nbecause bad. As was explained in a preceding chapter, all rough, hard\r\nwork is done by natives; not that white men could not, in the more\r\ntemperate regions, perfectly well do it, but because white men think it\r\nbeneath them and only fit for blacks. Now black labour is seldom\r\neffective labour. The mixed race called \"Cape boys\" are good drivers,\r\nand quite fit for many kinds of railway work. They are employed in the\r\nbuilding trades and in sawmills, and to some extent in such trades as\r\nbootmaking. The Kafirs of the eastern province and of Natal are more raw\r\nthan the \"Cape boys.\" They make good platelayers on railways, and having\r\nplenty of physical strength, will do any sort of rough work they are set\r\nto. But they have no aptitude for trades requiring skill, and it will\r\ntake a generation or two to fit them for the finer kinds of carpentry or\r\nmetal-work, or for the handling of delicate machinery. Besides, they are\r\noften changeable and unstable, apt to forsake their employment for some\r\ntrifling cause. Their wages are certainly not high, ranging from ten to\r\ntwenty shillings a month, besides food, for any kind of rough outdoor\r\nwork. Miners are paid higher, and a Malay mason will get from thirty to\r\nforty shillings a week; but a white labourer at twice the price would,\r\nfor most kinds of work, be cheaper. Nor is it easy to get the amount of\r\nnative labour that may be needed, for the Kafir prefers to till his own\r\npatch of ground or turn out his cattle on the veldt. The scale for white\r\nworkmen is, of course, far higher, ranging from £2 10_s._ to £8 a week,\r\naccording to the nature of the work and the competence of the artisan.\r\nSuch wages are nearly double those paid in England, treble those paid in\r\nsome manufacturing districts of Germany or Belgium, higher even than\r\nthose paid in the United States. It is therefore evident that, what with\r\nthe badness of the cheaper labour and the dearness of the better, a\r\nmanufacturer would, in South Africa, be severely handicapped in\r\ncompeting with either Europe or the United States. Protectionists may\r\nthink that a high tariff on foreign manufactured goods would foster\r\nindustrial undertakings in these Colonies. Such a tariff would, however,\r\nneed to be fixed very high to give the local factory a chance--so high,\r\nindeed, that it would excite serious opposition from the consumer. And,\r\nin point of fact, there has been hitherto no cry for a tariff to protect\r\nhome manufactures, because so few people are at present interested in\r\nhaving it. Such protection as exists is directed to food-stuffs, in\r\norder to please the agricultural classes, and induce a wider cultivation\r\nof the soil; and the tariff on other goods is almost solely for revenue.\r\n\r\nThe conditions I have described may, and probably will, change as the\r\nindustrial training of the natives improves and their aversion to labour\r\ndeclines under the pressure of increasing numbers and a reduction of the\r\nquantity of land available for them. But a review of the present state\r\nof things points to the conclusion that no great development of\r\nmanufactures, and of a white population occupied in manufactures, is to\r\nbe expected, at least for some time to come.\r\n\r\nThree other observations must at this stage be made. Till very recently,\r\nSouth Africans had what the Psalmist desired--neither poverty nor\r\nriches. There were hardly any white paupers, because the substratum of\r\npopulation was black; and as few black paupers, because a Kafir needs\r\nnothing but food. On the other hand, there were no rich whites. The\r\nfarmers, both agriculturists and ranchmen, lived in a sort of rude\r\nplenty, with no luxuries and very little money. Everybody was tolerably\r\nwell off, nobody was wealthy. There were large stock-farms, as in\r\nAustralia, but the owners of these farms did not make the immense gains\r\nwhich many Australian squatters and some American cattle-men have made.\r\nAccordingly, when capital was needed for the development of the mines it\r\nwas obtained from home. A few successful residents did, no doubt, make\r\nout of the diamond fields large sums, which they presently applied to\r\nthe development of the gold-fields. But by far the greater part of the\r\nmoney spent in opening up mines, both on the Witwatersrand and\r\nelsewhere, has come from Europe, chiefly from England, but to a\r\nconsiderable extent also from France, Germany and Holland. Accordingly\r\nnineteen twentieths at least of the profits made by the miners are paid\r\nto shareholders in those countries, and not expended in South Africa.\r\nEven among those who have made fortunes out of diamonds or gold by their\r\npersonal enterprise on the spot, the majority return to Europe and spend\r\ntheir incomes there. The country, therefore, does not get the full\r\nbenefit, in the way either of payments for labour (except, of course,\r\nlabour at the mines) or of increased consumption of articles, out of its\r\nmineral products, but is rather in the position of Mexico or Peru in the\r\nseventeenth century, when the bulk of the precious metals won from the\r\nmines went to Spain as a sort of tribute. There are at this moment\r\nprobably not more than a dozen rich men, as Europe counts riches,\r\nresident in the country, and all of these are to be found either at\r\nJohannesburg or at Cape Town. Most of them will after a time betake\r\nthemselves to Europe. Nor is there any sign that the number of local\r\nfortunes will increase; for the motives which draw men away from\r\nJohannesburg to Europe are likely to continue as strong in the future as\r\nthey are at present.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as the whites are not--except at Johannesburg, where the\r\nlavishness of a mining population is conspicuous--large consumers of\r\nluxuries, so the blacks are poor consumers of all save the barest\r\nnecessaries of life. It is not merely that they have no money. It is\r\nthat they have no wants, save of food and of a few common articles of\r\nclothing. The taste for the articles which civilized man requires is\r\ngrowing, as the traders in Bechuanaland have already begun to find, but\r\nit grows slowly, and is still in a rudimentary stage. The demand which\r\nSouth Africa is likely to offer either for home-made or for imported\r\nproducts must, therefore, be measured, not by the gross population, but\r\nby the white population, and, indeed, by the town-dwelling whites; for\r\nthe Dutch farmer or ranchman, whether in the British Colonies or in the\r\nDutch Republics, has very little cash in his pocket, and lives in a\r\nprimitive way. It is only the development of the mines that makes South\r\nAfrica a growing market for European goods.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there is not much European immigration, except of artizans; and\r\nthese go chiefly to the gold mines of the Rand. Few agriculturists come\r\nout, because farms have seldom been offered by any of the Governments on\r\nthe same easy terms as those which prevail in Canada or New Zealand, and\r\nbecause the climate and the existence of a black population deter the\r\nagricultural classes of northern Europe. Although the Government of Cape\r\nColony has little or no land obviously fit for tillage to dispose of,\r\nbecause all the untilled area not absolutely barren has been\r\nappropriated for stock-farms, still there are districts on the south\r\ncoasts of Cape Colony, as well as in Natal and in the healthy uplands of\r\nMashonaland, which Englishmen or Germans might cultivate with the\r\nassistance (in the hotter parts) of a little native labour, and which\r\nItalians or Portuguese might cultivate by their own labour, without\r\nnative help. The Germans who were brought out in 1856 throve in body and\r\nestate on the farms which they tilled with their own hands near\r\nGrahamstown. Nevertheless, few agricultural immigrants enter, partly, no\r\ndoubt, because so much of the land is held by a comparatively small\r\nnumber of persons, and reserved by them (as just observed) for pastoral\r\npurposes only. Neither do men go from Europe to start ranching, for the\r\npastoral lands are taken up, except in those wilder regions where no one\r\ncould thrive without some previous experience of the country. The\r\nsettling of the newer parts of the country, such as those between the\r\nZambesi and the tropic of Capricorn, is chiefly carried on by the Boers\r\nof the Transvaal, and, to a less extent, of the British Colonies; for\r\nthe Boers retain their passion for trekking out into the wilderness,\r\nwhile the English, with few exceptions, like to keep within reach of\r\none another and of civilisation. Accordingly, the country receives\r\ncomparatively few recruits from rural Europe, and its agricultural\r\npopulation grows only by natural increase. There are probably more\r\nnatives of India to-day tilling the soil in Natal alone than the whole\r\nnumber of agriculturists who have come from Europe in the last thirty\r\nyears. Legislation which should attract such agriculturists by the offer\r\nof tillage farms of moderate size would be a great benefit to the\r\nColonies.\r\n\r\nWe may now endeavour to sum up the facts of the case, and state the\r\nconclusions to which they point.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa is already, and will be to an increasing extent, a country\r\nof great mineral wealth. It is only in the diamond-fields, especially\r\nthose of Kimberley, and in the gold-fields of the Witwatersrand, that\r\nthis wealth has yet been proved to exist, so far as regards precious\r\nstones and precious metals, but it may exist also in many other\r\ndistricts. It is not confined to precious stones and metals, and when\r\nthese have been exhausted, copper, iron, and coal may continue to\r\nfurnish good returns to mine-owners and plenty of employment to\r\nwork-people. The duration of the gold-fields generally is uncertain, but\r\nthose of the Witwatersrand will last for at least half a century, and\r\nwill maintain for all that period an industrial population and a market\r\nfor commodities which, though small when measured by the standard of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, will be quite unique in Africa south of the\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa is, and will continue to be, a great grazing country; for\r\nnearly all of its vast area is fit for live stock, though in large\r\nregions the proportion of stock to the acre must remain small, owing to\r\nthe scarcity of feed. It will therefore continue to export wool, goats'\r\nhair, and hides in large quantities, and may also export meat, and\r\npossibly dairy products.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa has been, is, and will probably continue to be for a good\r\nwhile to come, a country in which only a very small part of the land is\r\ntilled, and from which little agricultural produce, except fruit, sugar,\r\nand perhaps tobacco, will be exported. Only two things seem likely to\r\nincrease its agricultural productiveness. One of these is the discovery\r\nof some preservative against malarial fever which might enable the\r\nlowlands of the east coast, from Durban northward, to be cultivated much\r\nmore largely than they are now. The other is the introduction of\r\nirrigation on a large scale, an undertaking which at present would be\r\nprofitable in a few places only. Whether in future it will be worth\r\nwhile to irrigate largely, and whether, if this be done, it will be done\r\nby companies buying and working large farms or by companies distributing\r\nwater to small farmers, as the Government distributes water in Egypt and\r\nsome parts of India, are questions which may turn out to have an\r\nimportant bearing on the development of the country, but which need not\r\nbe discussed now.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa has not been, and shows no sign of becoming, a\r\nmanufacturing country. Water power is absent. Coal is not of the best\r\nquality. Labour is neither cheap nor good. Even the imposition of a\r\npretty high protective tariff would not be likely to stimulate the\r\nestablishment of iron-works or foundries on a large scale, nor of\r\nfactories of textile goods, for the local market is too small to make\r\ncompetition with Europe a profitable enterprise. In these respects, as\r\nin many others, the conditions, physical and economic, differ so much\r\nfrom those of the British North American or Australian Colonies that the\r\ncourse of industrial development is likely to be quite different from\r\nwhat it has been there.\r\n\r\nFrom these conclusions another of great importance follows. The white\r\npopulation will remain scanty in proportion to the area of the country.\r\nAt present, it is, in the two British Colonies and the two Dutch\r\nRepublics, only about one and a half persons to the square mile, while\r\nover the other territories it is incomparably smaller.\r\n\r\nThe country will probably remain, so long as present agricultural\r\nconditions continue, a wilderness, with a few oases of population\r\nscattered at long distances from one another. The white inhabitants\r\nwill, moreover, continue to be very unequally distributed. At present,\r\nof a total population in the last-mentioned four States of about\r\n730,000, more than one-fourth lives in the mining district of the Rand;\r\none-sixth is found in the five principal seaports on the southern and\r\nsouth-eastern coast; the remaining seven-twelfths are thinly dispersed\r\nover the rest of the country in solitary farms or villages, or in a very\r\nfew small towns, the largest of which, Kimberley, has only 10,000\r\ninhabitants. The only towns that are growing are those five seaports,\r\nand Johannesburg with its tributary mining villages. Assuming the\r\npresent growth of the Rand to continue, it may have in ten years about\r\n500,000 whites, which will be not much less than a half of the then\r\nwhite population of the whole country. Stimulated by the trade which the\r\nRand will supply, the five seaports will probably also grow; while\r\nelsewhere population may remain almost stationary. Unless the gold reefs\r\nof the country beyond the Limpopo turn out well and create in that\r\nregion miniature copies of the Rand district, there seems no reason to\r\nexpect the total number of whites to reach 1,200,000 in less than twenty\r\nyears. After that time growth will depend upon the future of\r\nagriculture, and the future of agriculture depends on so many causes\r\nindependent of South Africa that it would be unsafe to make any\r\npredictions regarding it. I know some South Africans, able men, who\r\nthink that the day will come when the blacks will begin to retire\r\nnorthward, and a large white population will till their own farms by\r\ntheir own labour, with the aid of irrigation. Of the advent of such a\r\nday there are no present signs, yet stranger changes have happened in\r\nour time than this change would be. Other South Africans believe that\r\nminerals not less valuable than those which the last twenty years have\r\nrevealed are likely to be discovered in other places. This also may\r\nhappen,--South Africa, it has been said, is a land of surprises,--and if\r\nit does happen there may be another inrush like that which has filled\r\nthe Rand. All that one can venture to do now is to point out the\r\nprobable result of the conditions which exist at this moment; and these,\r\nthough they point to a continued increase of mineral production, do not\r\npoint to any large or rapid increase of white inhabitants.\r\n\r\nTwenty years hence the white population is likely to be composed in\r\nabout equal proportions of urban and rural elements. The urban element\r\nwill be mainly mining, gathered at one great centre on the\r\nWitwatersrand, and possibly at some smaller centres in other districts.\r\nThe rural element, consisting of people who live in villages or solitary\r\nfarmhouses, will remain comparatively backward, because little affected\r\nby the social forces which work swiftly and potently upon close-packed\r\nindustrial communities, and it may find itself very different in tone,\r\ntemper, and tendencies from its urban fellow-citizens. The contrast now\r\nso marked between the shopkeeper of Cape Town and the miner of\r\nJohannesburg on the one hand, and the farmer of the Karroo or the\r\nNorthern Transvaal on the other, may be then hardly less marked between\r\nthe two sections of the white population. But these sections will have\r\none thing in common. Both will belong to an upper stratum of society;\r\nboth will have beneath them a mass of labouring blacks, and they will\r\ntherefore form an industrial aristocracy resting on Kafir labour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: It is still doubtful whether very large areas can be\r\nirrigated by means of artesian wells.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: The Transvaal coal-fields are said to extend over 56,000\r\nsquare miles; there is also a coal-field in the eastern part of Cape\r\nColony, near the borders of the Orange Free State.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS AND FORECASTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn preceding chapters I have endeavoured to present a picture of South\r\nAfrica as it stands to-day, and to sketch the leading events that have\r\nmade its political conditions what they are. Now, in bringing the book\r\nto a close, I desire to add a few reflections on the forces which have\r\nbeen at work, and to attempt the more hazardous task of conjecturing how\r\nthose forces are likely to operate in the future.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the country, and the peculiar form which its problems\r\nhave taken, are the resultant of three causes. One of these is the\r\ncharacter which nature has impressed upon it. Of this I have already\r\nspoken (Chapter VI), pointing out how the high interior plateau, with\r\nits dry and healthy climate, determined the main line of European\r\nadvance and secured the predominance, not of the race which first\r\ndiscovered the country, but of the race which approached it, far later\r\nin time, from its best side. It is also in this physical character that\r\none must seek the explanation of the remarkably slow progress of the\r\ncountry in wealth and population. South Africa began to be occupied by\r\nwhite men earlier than any part of the American continent. The first\r\nDutch settlement was but little posterior to those English settlements\r\nin North America which have grown into a nation of seventy-seven\r\nmillions of people, and nearly a century and a half prior to the first\r\nEnglish settlements in Australia. It is the unhealthiness of the east\r\ncoast and the dryness of the rest of the country that are mainly\r\naccountable for this tardy growth--a growth which might have been still\r\nmore tardy but for the political causes that drove the Boers into the\r\nfar interior. And again, it is the physical configuration of the country\r\nthat has made it, and is likely to keep it, one country. This is a point\r\nof cardinal importance. Though divided into two British Colonies, with\r\nseveral other pieces of British territory, and two Boer Republics, the\r\nhabitable parts of South Africa form one community, all the parts of\r\nwhich must stand or fall together. The great plateau is crossed by no\r\nlines of physical demarcation all the way from the Zambesi to the Hex\r\nRiver (some fifty miles north-east of Cape Town), and the coast regions\r\nare closely bound by economic ties to the plateau, which through them\r\ntouches the outer world. Popular speech which talks of South Africa as\r\none whole is scientifically right.\r\n\r\nThe two other causes that have ruled the fortunes and guided the\r\ndevelopment of the country have been the qualities and relations of the\r\nraces that inhabit it, and the character of the Government which has\r\nsought from afar to control the relations of those races. These deserve\r\nto be more fully considered.\r\n\r\nEnglish statesmen have for more than fifty years been accustomed to say\r\nthat of all the Colonies of Great Britain none has given to the mother\r\ncountry so much disquiet and anxiety as South Africa has done. This is\r\nanother way of expressing the fact which strikes the traveller--that no\r\nother British Colony has compressed so much exciting history into the\r\nlast sixty or seventy years. The reason is undoubtedly to be found in\r\nthe circumstance that South Africa has had two sets of race questions to\r\ndeal with: questions between the whites and the aborigines, questions\r\nbetween the Dutch and the English. It is this latter set of questions\r\nthat have been the main thread of South African annals. Why have they\r\nproved so troublesome? Why are they so troublesome to-day, when we ought\r\nto be able to look at them with a vision enlarged and a temper mellowed\r\nby wide experience? Partly from an element inherent in all race\r\nquestions. They are not questions that can be settled on pure business\r\nlines, by an adjustment of the material interests of the parties\r\nconcerned. They involve sentiment, and thus, like questions of religion,\r\ntouch the deeper springs of emotion. And they spring from, or are\r\ninvolved with, incompatibilities of character which prevent the men of\r\neither stock from fully understanding, and therefore fully trusting, the\r\nmen of the other. Suspicion, if not positive aversion, makes it\r\ndifficult for two races to work together, even where the political\r\narrangements that govern their relations are just and reasonable. But\r\nsomething may also be ascribed to certain malign accidents which blasted\r\nthe prospect, once fair, of a friendly fusion between the Dutch and the\r\nEnglish peoples that seemed eminently fit to be fused. The British\r\nannexation of Cape Colony occurred at an unfortunate time. Had it\r\nhappened thirty years earlier no difficulties would have arisen over the\r\nnatives and slavery, because at that time the new philanthropy had not\r\nbegun to influence English opinion or the British Government. Had it\r\nhappened in later days, when steam had given quicker and more frequent\r\nocean communication, Britain and the Colony would each have better known\r\nwhat the other thought and wished, and the errors that alienated the\r\nBoers might never have been committed. The period which followed the\r\nannexation was precisely the period in which the differences between\r\nEnglish feeling and colonial feeling were most marked and most likely to\r\nlead to misunderstanding and conflict.\r\n\r\nFor there has been in the antagonism of the Boers and the English far\r\nmore than the jealousy of two races. There has been a collision of two\r\ntypes of civilisation, one belonging to the nineteenth century, the\r\nother to the seventeenth. His isolation, not only in a distant corner\r\nof the southern hemisphere, but in the great, wide, bare veldt over\r\nwhich his flocks and herds roam, has kept the Boer fast bound in the\r\nideas and habits of a past age, and he shrinks from the contact of the\r\nkeen restless modern man, with new arts of gain and new forms of\r\npleasure, just as a Puritan farmer of Cromwell's day might shrink were\r\nhe brought to life and forced to plunge into the current of modern\r\nLondon. Had the Boers been of English stock, but subjected to the same\r\nconditions as those which kept the seventeenth century alive in the\r\ncountry behind the Cape, they too would have resisted the new ways of\r\nthe new rulers; but their identity of race and speech with those rulers\r\nwould have abridged the struggle. It is the fact that the old Cape\r\nsettlers had a language of their own, and a sense of blood-kinship to\r\nhold them together that has enabled the Dutch element to remain\r\ncohesive, and given them an Afrikander patriotism of their own--a\r\npatriotism which is not Dutch, for they care nothing for the traditions\r\nof Holland, but purely Africander.\r\n\r\nTheir local position as half-nomadic inhabitants of a wide interior gave\r\na peculiar character to that struggle between the mother country and her\r\ncolonists which has arisen more than once in British history. They were\r\nso few and so poor, as compared with the people of the thirteen Colonies\r\nof the North American coast in 1776, that it was useless for them to\r\nrebel and fight for independence, as those Colonies had done. On the\r\nother hand, they were not, like the French of lower Canada, rooted in\r\nthe soil as agriculturists. Hence a middle course between rebellion and\r\nsubmission offered itself. That course was secession. They renounced not\r\nonly their political allegiance, but even the very lands where they\r\ndwelt, seeking the protection of the desert as other emigrants before\r\nthem had sought that of the ocean. Thus again, and more completely,\r\nisolated since 1836, the emigrant Boers, and especially those of the\r\nTransvaal, have been able to retain their old ways for sixty years\r\nlonger, and have grown more anti-English than ever. On the other hand,\r\nthe English of the Colony, whose English sentiment was quickened by\r\nthese events, have remained more thoroughly English than those of most\r\nBritish Colonies, and have never conceived the idea of severing their\r\nown connection with the mother country.\r\n\r\nThat the emigrant Boers became republicans was due rather to\r\ncircumstance than to conscious purpose. A monarch they could not have,\r\nbecause there was no one designated for the place, as well as because\r\nthey had the instinct of general disobedience. But for a long time they\r\ntried to rub along with no more government or leadership than the needs\r\nof war required. Seldom has any people been so little influenced by\r\nabstract political ideas, yet seldom has a people enjoyed so perfect an\r\nopportunity of trying political experiments and testing the theories of\r\npolitical philosophers. But the Boers were, and are still, a strictly\r\npractical people. Their houses give them cover from sun and rain, but\r\nnothing more; there is little comfort and no elegance. So their\r\ninstitutions were the fewest and simplest under which men have ever\r\ngoverned themselves. It is therefore no theoretical attachment to\r\ndemocracy that has helped the Boers to resist the English; it is merely\r\nthe wish to be left alone, and a stubbornness of will that made\r\nindependence seem more desirable the more it was threatened.\r\n\r\nEven this admirable stubbornness would hardly have carried them through\r\nbut for the dispersion over vast spaces. That dispersion, while it\r\nretarded their political growth and social progress, made them hard to\r\nreach or to conquer. The British Government despaired of over-taking and\r\nsurrounding them, for they were scattered like antelopes over the lonely\r\nveldt, and there was a still vaster and equally lonely veldt behind them\r\ninto which they could retire. To pursue them seemed a wild-goose chase,\r\nand a costly one, in which there was much to spend and little to gain.\r\nThus their weakness has proved their strength, and the more settled they\r\nbecome in the future, the less can they hope to escape the influences\r\nthey have so long resisted.\r\n\r\nBut for the maintenance of the sentiment of Boer nationality by the two\r\nBoer Republics, the antagonism of Dutch and English in Cape Colony would\r\nhave ere now died out, for there has been little or nothing in colonial\r\npolitics to sustain it. The interests of the farmers of both stocks are\r\nidentical, their rights are in all respects the same, and the British\r\nGovernment has been perfectly impartial. The Boers in the Colony are\r\ngood citizens and loyal subjects. It is only the character of the\r\ncountry and the conditions of their pastoral life that have retarded\r\ntheir social fusion with the English, as it is only the passions aroused\r\nby the strife of Boers and Englishmen in the Transvaal that evoked in\r\n1881, and again evoked in 1896, a political opposition between the\r\nraces. Fortunately, the sentiments of the Dutch have possessed a safe\r\noutlet in the colonial Parliament. The wisdom of the policy which gave\r\nresponsible government has been signally vindicated; for, as\r\nconstitutional means have existed for influencing the British\r\nGovernment, feelings which might otherwise have found vent in a revolt\r\nor a second secession have been diverted into a safe channel.\r\n\r\nThe other set of race troubles, those between white settlers and the\r\naborigines of the land have been graver in South Africa than any which\r\nEuropean governments have had to face in any other new country. The Red\r\nMen of North America, splendidly as they fought, never seriously checked\r\nthe advance of the whites. The revolts of the aborigines in Peru and\r\nCentral America were easily suppressed. The once warlike Maoris of New\r\nZealand have, under the better methods of the last twenty-five years,\r\nbecome quiet and tolerably contented. Even the French in Algeria had\r\nnot so long a strife to maintain with the Moorish and Kabyle tribes as\r\nthe Dutch and English had with the natives at the Cape. The south-coast\r\nKafirs far outnumbered the whites, were full of courage, had a rough and\r\nthickly wooded country to defend, and were so ignorant as never to know\r\nwhen they were beaten. A more intelligent race might have sooner\r\nabandoned the contest. The melancholy chapter of native wars seems to be\r\nnow all but closed, except perhaps in the far north. These wars,\r\nhowever, did much to retard the progress of South Africa and to give it\r\na bad name. They deterred many an English farmer from emigrating thither\r\nin the years between 1810 and 1870. They annoyed and puzzled the home\r\ngovernment, and made it think the Colony a worthless possession, whence\r\nlittle profit or credit was to be drawn in return for the unending\r\nmilitary expenditure. And they gave the colonists ground for complaints,\r\nsometimes just, sometimes unjust, against the home government, which was\r\nconstantly accused of parsimony, of shortsightedness, of vacillation, of\r\nsentimental weakness, in sending out too few troops, in refusing to\r\nannex fresh territory, in patching up a hollow peace, in granting too\r\neasy terms to the natives.\r\n\r\nWhoever reviews the whole South African policy of the British Government\r\nduring the ninety-three years that have elapsed since 1806 cannot but\r\nadmit that many errors were committed. Many precious opportunities for\r\nestablishing British authority on a secure basis were lost. Many things\r\nwere done imperfectly, and therefore had to be done over and over again,\r\nwhich it would have been cheaper as well as wiser to have finished off\r\nat once. Many steps, prudent in themselves, and dictated by excellent\r\nmotives, were taken at a moment and in a way which made them\r\nmisunderstood and resisted. Reflecting on these mistakes, one sometimes\r\nwonders that the country was not lost altogether to Britain, and thinks\r\nof the saying of the old Swiss statesman: _Hominum negligentia, Dei\r\nprovidentia, regitur Helvetia_. It may nevertheless be truly said for\r\nthe British Government that it almost always sought to act justly, and\r\nthat such advances as it made were not dictated by an aggressive spirit,\r\nbut (with few exceptions) compelled by the necessities of the case. And\r\nit must not be forgotten that, as all home governments err in their\r\ncontrol of Colonies--Spain, Portugal, and France have certainly erred in\r\ntheir day far more fatally than England--so many of the errors which now\r\nmost startle us in the annals of South Africa were all but inevitable,\r\nbecause the wisest man could not have foreseen the course which things\r\nhave in fact taken. Who ever tries to look at the events of sixty,\r\nthirty, or even twenty years ago with the eyes of those times, and\r\nremembers that Colonial ministers in England had to consider not only\r\nwhat they thought best, but what they could get the uninstructed public\r\nopinion of their own country to accept, will be more indulgent than the\r\ncolonists are in their judgment of past mistakes. For instance, it is\r\napt to be forgotten that the Cape was not occupied with a view to the\r\nestablishment of a European Colony, in our present sense of the word.\r\nThe Dutch took it that they might plant a cabbage-garden; the English\r\ntook it that they might have a naval station and half-way house to\r\nIndia. Not till our own time did people begin to think of it as capable\r\nof supporting a great civilised community and furnishing a new market\r\nfor British goods; not till 1869 was it known as a region whence great\r\nwealth might be drawn. Hence Britain, which during the first half of\r\nthis century was busy in conquering India, in colonising Australasia,\r\nand in setting things to rights in Canada, never cared to bend her\r\nenergies to the development of South Africa, then a less promising field\r\nfor those energies, spent no more money on it than she could help, and\r\nsought to avoid the acquisition of new territory, because that meant new\r\ntroubles and new outlays.\r\n\r\nThe views of colonial policy which prevailed in England down till about\r\n1870 were very different from those which most of us now hold. The\r\nstatesmen of the last generation accepted that _consilium coercendi\r\nintra terminos imperii_ which, according to Tacitus, Augustus held sound\r\nfor an empire less scattered than is that of Britain; they thought that\r\nBritain had already more territory than she could hope to develop and\r\n(in the long run) to govern; and they therefore sought to limit rather\r\nthan increase her responsibilities. And they believed, reasoning\r\nsomewhat too hastily from the revolt of the North American Colonies,\r\nthat as soon as the new English communities to which self-government had\r\nbeen or was in due course to be granted, reached a certain level of\r\nwealth and population they would demand and receive their independence.\r\nThat the fruit would fall off the old tree as soon as it was ripe was\r\nthe favourite metaphor employed to convey what nearly all publicists\r\ntook to be an obvious truth. No one stated it so trenchantly as Disraeli\r\nwhen he wrote: \"These wretched Colonies will all be independent too in a\r\nfew years, and are a millstone round our necks;\" but the dogma was\r\ngenerally accepted by politicians belonging to both the great parties in\r\nthe state. Those, moreover, were days in which economy and retrenchment\r\nwere popular cries in England, and when it was deemed the duty of a\r\nstatesman to reduce as far as possible the burdens of the people.\r\nExpenditure on colonial wars and on the administration of half-settled\r\ndistricts was odious to the prudent and thrifty contemporaries or\r\ndisciples of Sir Robert Peel and Richard Cobden. Accordingly, the chief\r\naim of British statesmen from 1830 till 1870 was to arrest the tide of\r\nBritish advance, to acquire as little territory as possible, to leave\r\nrestless natives and emigrant Boers entirely to themselves. Desperate\r\nefforts were made to stop the Kafir wars. We can now see that the\r\ntendency--one may almost call it a law of nature--which everywhere over\r\nthe world has tempted or forced a strong civilised power to go on\r\nconquering the savage or half-civilised peoples on its borders, the\r\nprocess that has carried the English all over India and brought the\r\nRussians from the Volga to the Pamirs in one direction and to the mouth\r\nof the Amur in another, was certain to compel the British Government to\r\nsubdue and annex one Kafir tribe after another until either a desert or\r\nthe territory of some other civilised State was reached. But fifty years\r\nago this was not clearly perceived; so the process, which might have\r\ninflicted less suffering if it had been steadily and swiftly carried\r\nthrough, went on slowly and to the constant annoyance of statesmen at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nIt was the same as regards the great plateau and the Boer emigrants who\r\ndwelt there. Not from any sympathy with their love of independence, but\r\nbecause she did not want the trouble of pursuing and governing them and\r\nthe wide lands they were spread over, England resolved to abandon the\r\ninterior to them. In 1852 and 1854 she made a supreme effort to check\r\nher own onward career, first by recognizing the independence of the\r\nTransvaal emigrants whose allegiance she had theretofore claimed, then\r\nby actually renouncing her rights to the Orange River Sovereignty, and\r\nto those within it who desired to continue her subjects. What more could\r\na thrifty and cautious and conscientious country do? Nevertheless, these\r\ngood resolutions had to be reconsidered, these self-denying principles\r\nforegone. Circumstances were too strong for the Colonial Office. In 1869\r\nit accepted the protectorate of Basutoland. In 1871 it yielded to the\r\ntemptation of the diamond-fields, and took Griqualand West. Soon after\r\nit made a treaty with Khama, which gave the British a foothold in\r\nBechuanaland. In 1877 it annexed the Transvaal. By that time the old\r\nideas were beginning to pass away, and to be replaced by new views of\r\nthe mission and destiny of Britain. The wish of the British Government\r\nto stand still had been combated all along by powerful inducements to\r\nmove on. The colonists always pressed for an advance of the frontier.\r\nThe Governor usually pressed for it. The home government was itself\r\nhaunted by a fear that if it abandoned positions of vantage its\r\nsuccessors might afterwards have reason to rue the abandonment. These\r\nwere the considerations that drove British statesmen to the most\r\nmomentous forward steps that were taken. Two things, and two only, were\r\nreally vital to British interests--the control of the coasts, and the\r\ncontrol of an open road to the north. Accordingly, the two decisive\r\nsteps were the occupation of Natal in 1842-3, which shut off the Boers\r\nfrom the sea, and the taking of Griqualand West in 1871 (followed by the\r\ntaking of southern Bechuanaland in 1884), which secured between the\r\nTransvaal on the one side and the Kalahari Desert on the other a free\r\naccess to the great northern plateau.\r\n\r\nThe tide of English opinion began to turn about 1870, and since then it\r\nhas run with increasing force in the direction of what is called\r\nimperialism, and has indeed in some cases brought about annexations that\r\nare likely to prove unprofitable, because the territory acquired is too\r\nhot and unhealthy to be fit for British settlement. The strides of\r\nadvance made in 1884-5 and 1890 have been as bold and large as those of\r\nearlier days were timid and halting; and the last expiring struggles of\r\nthe old policy were seen in 1884, when Lord Derby, who belonged to the\r\ndeparting school, yielded a new convention to the importunity of the\r\nTransvaal Boers and allowed Germany to establish herself in Damaraland.\r\nBut it is due to Britain, which has been accused, and so far as regards\r\nSouth Africa unjustly accused (down to 1896), of aggressive aims, to\r\nrecall the fact that she strove for many years to restrict her dominion,\r\nand did not cease from her efforts until long experience had shown that\r\nit was hard to maintain the old policy, and until the advent on the\r\nscene of other European powers, whom it was thought prudent to keep at a\r\ndistance from her own settled territories, impelled her to join in that\r\ngeneral scramble for Africa which has been so strange a feature of the\r\nlast two decades.\r\n\r\nThere have been moments, even since the occupation of two points so\r\nimportant as Basutoland (in 1869) and Griqualand West (in 1871) when it\r\nhas seemed possible that South Africa might become Dutch rather than\r\nEnglish, such is the tenacity of that race, and so deep are the roots\r\nwhich its language has struck. With the discovery of the Witwatersrand\r\ngold-fields, drawing a new body of English immigrants into the country,\r\nthat possibility seems to have passed away. The process of territorial\r\ndistribution is in South Africa now complete. Every Colony and State has\r\nbecome limited by boundaries defined in treaties. Every native tribe has\r\nnow some legal white superior, and no native tribe remains any longer\r\nformidable. The old race questions have passed, or are passing, into new\r\nphases. But they will be at least as difficult in their new forms as in\r\ntheir old ones. I will devote the few remaining pages of this book to a\r\nshort consideration of them and of the other problems affecting the\r\nfuture of South Africa with which they are involved.\r\n\r\nReasons have been given in a preceding chapter for the conclusion that\r\nboth the white and the black races are likely to hold their ground over\r\nall the country, and that the black race will continue to be the more\r\nnumerous. Assuming the conditions of agriculture to remain what they are\r\nat present, and assuming that the causes which now discourage the\r\nestablishment of large manufacturing industries do not pass away, there\r\nwill probably be for the next seventy years a large white population on\r\nthe gold-field and at the chief seaports, and only a small white\r\npopulation over the rest of the country. Even should irrigation be\r\nlargely introduced, it would be carried on chiefly by black labourers.\r\nEven should low wages or the discovery of larger and better deposits of\r\niron and coal stimulate the development of great manufacturing\r\nindustries, still it is a black rather than a white population that\r\nwould be therewith increased. Various causes may be imagined which would\r\nraise or reduce the birth-rate and the infant death-rate among the\r\nnatives, so that one cannot feel sure that the existing proportion\r\nbetween them and the whites will be maintained. But if we regard the\r\nquestion from the point of view of labour, and take the natives to\r\nrepresent that part of the community which in Europe does the harder and\r\nless skilled kinds of work, both in country and in town, it may be\r\nconcluded that they will continue to form the majority even where they\r\nlive among the white people, without taking account of those areas where\r\nthey, and they alone, are settled on the land. It is, however,\r\nimpossible to conjecture how large the majority will be.\r\n\r\nThe Kafirs, as has been already suggested, will gradually lose their\r\ntribal organisation and come to live like Europeans, under European law.\r\nThey will become more generally educated, and will learn skilled\r\nhandicrafts; many--perhaps, in the long run, all--will speak English.\r\nThey will eventually cease to be heathens, even if they do not all\r\nbecome Christians. This process of Europeanisation will spread from\r\nsouth to north, and may probably not be complete in the north--at any\r\nrate, in the German and Portuguese parts of the north--till the end of\r\nthe next century. But long before that time the natives will in many\r\nplaces have begun to compete (as indeed a few already do) with the\r\nwhites in some kinds of well-paid labour. They will also, being better\r\neducated and better paid, have become less submissive than they are now,\r\nand a larger number of them will enjoy the suffrage.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the relations of the two races when these things have come\r\nabout, say within two or three generations? Consider what the position\r\nwill then be. Two races will be living on the same ground, in close and\r\nconstant economic relations, both those of employment and those of\r\ncompetition, speaking the same language and obeying the same laws,\r\ndiffering, no doubt, in strength of intelligence and will, yet with many\r\nmembers of the weaker race superior as individual men to many members of\r\nthe stronger. And these two races, separated by the repulsion of\r\nphysical differences, will have no social intercourse, no mixture of\r\nblood, but will each form a nation by itself for all purposes save those\r\nof industry and perhaps of politics. There will, no doubt, be the nexus\r\nof industrial interest, for the white employer will need the labour of\r\nthe blacks. But even in countries where no race differences intervene,\r\nthe industrial nexus does not prevent bitter class hatreds and labour\r\nwars.\r\n\r\nThat such a state of things will arrive is rendered probable not only by\r\nthe phenomena to be observed to-day in South Africa, but by the\r\nexperience of the Southern States of the American Union, where almost\r\nexactly what I have described has come to pass, with the addition that\r\nthe inferior race has in theory the same political rights as the\r\nsuperior. How will the relations of two races so living together be\r\nadjusted? The experience of the Southern States is too short to throw\r\nmuch light on this problem. It is, however, a painful experience in many\r\nrespects, and it causes the gravest anxieties for the future. Similar\r\nanxieties must press upon the mind of any one who in South Africa looks\r\nsixty or eighty years forward; and they are not diminished by the fact\r\nthat in South Africa the inferior race is far more numerous than the\r\nsuperior. But although the position I have outlined seems destined to\r\narrive, it is still so distant that we can no more predict the\r\nparticular form its difficulties will take than the mariner can describe\r\nthe rocks and trees upon an island whose blue mountains he begins to\r\ndescry on the dim horizon. Whatever those difficulties may be, they will\r\nbe less formidable if the whites realize, before the coloured people\r\nhave begun to feel a sense of wrong, that their own future is bound up\r\nwith that of the natives, and that the true interests of both races are\r\nin the long run the same.\r\n\r\nAlthough the facts we have been considering suggest the view that the\r\nwhite population of South Africa will be very small when compared with\r\nthat of the North American or Australasian Colonies, they also suggest\r\nthat the whites will in South Africa hold the position of an\r\naristocracy, and may draw from that position some of the advantages\r\nwhich belong to those who are occupied only on the higher kinds of work,\r\nand have fuller opportunities for intellectual cultivation than the mass\r\nof manual labourers enjoy. A large part of the whites will lead a\r\ncountry life, directing the field work or the ranching of their\r\nservants. Those who dwell in the towns will be merchants or employers of\r\nlabour or highly skilled artisans, corresponding generally to the upper\r\nand middle strata of society in North America or Australia, but probably\r\nwith a smaller percentage of exceptionally wealthy men. There is, of\r\ncourse, the danger that a class may spring up composed of men unfit for\r\nthe higher kinds of work, and yet too lazy or too proud to work with\r\ntheir hands; and some observers already discover signs of the appearance\r\nof such a class. If its growth can be averted the conditions for the\r\nprogress and happiness of the white race in South Africa seem\r\nfavourable; and we are approaching an age of the world when the quality\r\nof a population will be more important than its quantity.\r\n\r\nIn this forecast I have said nothing of the gold mines, because they\r\nwill not be a permanent factor. The present gold fever is a fleeting\r\nepisode in South African history. Gold has, no doubt, played a great\r\npart in that history. It was the hope of getting gold that made the\r\nPortuguese fix their first post at Sofala in 1505, and that carried the\r\nEnglish pioneers to Mashonaland in 1890. It was the discovery of the\r\n_banket_ gold beds on the Witwatersrand in 1885 that finally settled\r\nthe question whether South Africa was to be an English or a Dutch\r\ncountry. Yet gold mining will pass away in a few decades, for the\r\nmethods which the engineer now commands will enable him within that time\r\nto extract from the rocks all the wealth now stored up in them. A day\r\nwill come when nothing will be left to tell the traveller of the\r\nindustry which drew hundreds of thousands of men to a barren ridge,\r\nexcept the heaps of refuse whose ugliness few shrubs will, in that dry\r\nland, spring up to cover. But South Africa will still be a pastoral and\r\nagricultural country, and none the less happy because the gold is gone.\r\n\r\nNeither have I said anything as to the influence of any foreign power or\r\npeople upon the South Africans, because they will to all appearance\r\nremain affected in the way of literature and commerce, as well as of\r\npolitics, by Britain only. There is at present no land trade from\r\nBritish or Boer States with the territories of Germany and the Congo\r\nState which lie to the north; and spaces so vast, inhabited only by a\r\nfew natives, lie between that no such trade seems likely to arise for\r\nmany years to come. Continental Europe exerts little influence on South\r\nAfrican ideas or habits; for the Boers, from causes already explained,\r\nhave no intellectual affinity with modern Holland, and the Germans who\r\nhave settled in British territories have become quickly Anglified.\r\nCommerce is almost exclusively with English ports. Some little traffic\r\nbetween Germany and Delagoa Bay has lately sprung up, aided by the\r\nestablishment of a German line of steamers to that harbour. Vessels come\r\nwith emigrants from India to Natal, though the Government of that Colony\r\nis now endeavouring to check the arrival of any but indentured coolies;\r\nand there are signs that an important direct trade with the United\r\nStates, especially in cereals and agricultural machinery, may hereafter\r\nbe developed. In none of these cases, however, does it seem probable\r\nthat commercial intercourse will have any considerable influence\r\noutside the sphere of commerce. With Australia it is different. Having\r\nceased, since the opening of the Suez Canal, to be the halfway house to\r\nIndia, the Cape has become one of the halfway houses from Britain to\r\nAustralasia. The outgoing New Zealand steamers, as well as the steamers\r\nof the Aberdeen Australian line, touch there; grain is imported,\r\nalthough the high tariff restricts this trade, and many Australian\r\nminers traverse Cape Colony on their way to the Witwatersrand. A feeling\r\nof intercolonial amity is beginning to grow up, to which a happy\r\nexpression was given by the Cape Government when they offered financial\r\nassistance to the Australian Colonies during the recent commercial\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nWith the other great country of the Southern hemisphere there seems to\r\nbe extremely little intercourse. Britain did not use, when she might\r\nhave legitimately used, the opportunity that was offered her early in\r\nthis century of conferring upon the temperate regions of South America\r\nthe benefits of ordered freedom and a progressive population. Had the\r\nterritories of the Argentine Republic (which now include Patagonia),\r\nterritories then almost vacant, been purchased from Spain and peopled\r\nfrom England, a second Australia might have arisen in the West, and\r\nthere would now be a promise not only of commerce, but ultimately of a\r\nleague based upon community of race, language, and institutions between\r\nthree great English-speaking States in the south temperate zone. That\r\nopportunity has, however, passed away; and southern South America,\r\nhaving now been settled by Spaniards and Italians, with a smaller number\r\nof Germans, seems destined to such fortunes as the Hispano-American race\r\ncan win for her. But it may well be hoped that as trade increases\r\nbetween South Africa and Australia, there may come with more frequent\r\nintercourse a deepening sense of kinship and a fuller sympathy,\r\ninspiring to both communities, and helpful to any efforts that may\r\nhereafter be made to knit more closely together the English-speaking\r\npeoples all over the world.\r\n\r\nAlthough the relations of the white race to the black constitute the\r\ngravest of the difficulties which confront South Africa, this difficulty\r\nis not the nearest one. More urgent, if less serious, is the other race\r\nproblem--that of adjusting the rights and claims of the Dutch and the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nIt has already been explained that, so far as Cape Colony and Natal are\r\nconcerned, there is really no question pending between the two races,\r\nand nothing to prevent them from working in perfect harmony and concord.\r\nNeither does the Orange Free State provide any fuel for strife, since\r\nthere both Boers and English live in peace and are equally attached to\r\nthe institutions of their Republic. It is in the Transvaal that the\r\ncentre of disturbance lies; it is thence that the surrounding earth has\r\nso often been shaken and the peace of all South Africa threatened. I\r\nhave already described the circumstances which brought about the recent\r\ntroubles in that State. To comment upon what has happened since the\r\nrising, to criticize either the attitude of the President or the various\r\nessays in diplomacy of the British Government, would be to enter that\r\nfield of current politics which I have resolved to avoid. What may fitly\r\nbe done here is to state the uncontroverted and dominant facts of the\r\nsituation as it stands in the autumn of 1897.[90]\r\n\r\nWhat are these facts? The Boer population of the Transvaal is roughly\r\nestimated at 65,000, of whom about 24,000 are voting citizens. The\r\nUitlanders, or alien population, five-sixths of whom speak English, are\r\nestimated at 180,000, of whom nearly one-half are adult males. These\r\nUitlanders hold sixty-three per cent. of the landed and ninety per cent.\r\nof the personal property in the country. In December, 1895, their number\r\nwas increasing at the rate of one thousand per week through arrivals\r\nfrom Cape Town alone; and though this influx fell off for a time, while\r\npolitical troubles were checking the development of the mines, it rose\r\nagain with the renewal of that development. Should the Deep Level mines\r\ngo on prospering as is expected, the rate of immigration will be\r\nsustained, and within ten years there will probably be at least 500,000\r\nUitlanders in the Republic, that is to say, nearly eight times the\r\nnumber of the Boers.\r\n\r\nThe numerical disproportion between these excluded persons--a very large\r\npart of whom will have taken root in the country--and the old citizens\r\nwill then have become overwhelming, and the claim of the former to enjoy\r\nsome share in the government will be practically irresistible. The\r\nconcession of this share may come before 1907--I incline to think it\r\nwill--or it may come somewhat later. The precise date is a small matter,\r\nand depends upon personal causes. But that the English-speaking element\r\nwill, if the mining industry continues to thrive, become politically as\r\nwell as economically supreme, seems inevitable. No political agitation\r\nor demonstrations in the Transvaal, much less any intervention from\r\noutside, need come into the matter. It is only of the natural causes\r\nalready at work that I speak, and these natural causes are sufficient to\r\nbring about the result. A country must, after all, take its character\r\nfrom the large majority of its inhabitants, especially when those who\r\nform that large majority are the wealthiest, most educated, and most\r\nenterprising part of the population.\r\n\r\nWhether this inevitable admission of the new-comers to citizenship will\r\nhappen suddenly or gradually, in quiet or in storm, no one can venture\r\nto predict. There are things which we can perceive to be destined to\r\noccur, though the time and the manner may be doubtful. But as it will be\r\ndictated by the patent necessities of the case, one may well hope that\r\nit will come about in a peaceable way and leave behind no sense of\r\nirritation in either race. Boers and Englishmen cannot in the Transvaal\r\nso easily blend and learn to work together as they have done in the\r\nOrange Free State, because they were in the latter State far less\r\nsocially dissimilar. But the extension of the suffrage, while it will be\r\nfollowed by legislation beneficial to the mining industry, need not\r\ninvolve legislation harmful to the material interests of the Boer\r\nelement. On the contrary, the Boers themselves will ultimately profit by\r\nany increase in the prosperity of the country. An improved\r\nadministration will give a more assured status to the judiciary, as well\r\nas a better set of laws and better internal communications, advantages\r\nwhich will be helpful to the whole Republic.\r\n\r\nThat the change should come about peaceably is much to be desired in the\r\ninterest not only of the Transvaal itself, but of all South Africa. The\r\nirritation of the Dutch element in Cape Colony, both in 1881 and again\r\nin 1896, was due to an impression that their Transvaal kinsfolk were\r\nbeing unfairly dealt with. Should that impression recur, its influence\r\nboth on the Dutch of Cape Colony, and on the people of the Free State,\r\nwhose geographical position makes their attitude specially important,\r\nwould be unfortunate. The history of South Africa, like that of other\r\ncountries nearer home, warns us how dangerous a factor sentiment, and\r\nespecially the sense of resentment at injustice, may become in politics,\r\nand how it may continue to work mischief even when the injustice has\r\nbeen repented of. It is, therefore, not only considerations of\r\nmagnanimity and equity, but also considerations of policy, that\r\nrecommend to the English in South Africa and to the British Government\r\nan attitude of patience, prudence, and strict adherence to legal\r\nrights. They are entitled to require the same adherence from the\r\nTransvaal Government, but it is equally their interest not to depart\r\nfrom it themselves, and to avoid even the least appearance of\r\naggression. The mistakes of the past are not irremediable. Tact,\r\ncoolness, and patience--above all, patience--must gradually bring about\r\nthat reconcilement and fusion of the two races to which, it can scarcely\r\nbe doubted, South Africa will at last attain.\r\n\r\nWhen, by the enfranchisement of the Uitlanders, the Transvaal has ceased\r\nto be a purely Boer State, questions will arise as to its relations with\r\nthe other States of South Africa. Cape Colony and the Orange Free State,\r\nas well as Basutoland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate, already form a\r\nCustoms Union, and they have long sought to induce the Transvaal and\r\nNatal to enter into it and thereby establish internal free trade\r\nthroughout the country. Natal at last consented (in 1898); but the\r\nTransvaal people steadily refused, desiring to stand as much aloof as\r\npossible from Cape Colony, as well as to raise for themselves a revenue\r\non imports larger than that which they would receive as partners in the\r\nCustoms Union. A reformed Transvaal Government would probably enter the\r\nCustoms Union; and this would usher in the further question of a\r\nconfederation of all the States and Colonies of South Africa. That\r\nproject was mooted by Sir George Grey (when Governor) more than thirty\r\nyears ago, and was actively pressed by Lord Carnarvon (when Colonial\r\nSecretary) and Sir Bartle Frere between 1875 and 1880. It failed at that\r\ntime, partly owing to the annoyance of the Orange Free State at the loss\r\nof the diamond-fields in 1871, partly to the reluctance of the Dutch\r\nparty at the Cape, who were roused against the proposal by their\r\nTransvaal kinsfolk. The desire for it is believed to have moved some of\r\nthose who joined in the Transvaal Uitlander movement of 1895-96, and no\r\none can discuss the future of the country without adverting to it. The\r\nadvantages it offers are obvious. A confederation would render in Africa\r\nservices similar to those which the federal system has rendered in the\r\nUnited States and Canada, and which are expected by the colonial\r\nstatesmen who have laboured to establish such a system in Australia. I\r\nheard not only railways and finance (including tariff and currency), but\r\nalso commercial law and native questions, suggested as matters fit to be\r\nintrusted to a federal authority; while it seemed to be thought that the\r\nscope of such an authority should, on the whole, be narrower than it is\r\nunder the Canadian Constitution, or under that of the United States. The\r\nlove of local independence is strong in South Africa, but might be\r\ndeferred to and appeased, as is being done in Australia, by appropriate\r\nconstitutional provisions. So far, no fatal obstacle stands in the way;\r\nbut a difficulty has been thought to arise from the fact that whereas\r\nCape Colony, Natal, and the other British territories are part of the\r\ndominions of the British Crown, the Orange Free State is an independent\r\nRepublic, and the Transvaal may be so when federation becomes a\r\npractical issue. \"Can a federal tie,\" it is asked, \"bind into one body\r\ncommunities some of which are Republics, while others, though\r\npractically self-governing, are legally parts of a monarchy?\"\r\n\r\nTo this it may be answered that there have been instances of such\r\nconfederations. In the Germanic Confederation, which lasted from 1815\r\ntill 1866, there were four free Republics, as well as many monarchies,\r\nsome large, some small. The Swiss Confederation (as established after\r\nthe Napoleonic wars) used to contain, in the canton of Neuchatel, a\r\nmember whose sovereign was the King of Prussia. And as it is not\r\nhistorically essential to the conception of a federal State that all its\r\nconstituent communities should have the same form of internal\r\ngovernment, so practically it would be possible, even if not very easy,\r\nto devise a scheme which should recognize the freedom of each member to\r\ngive itself the kind of constitution it desired. Such an executive head\r\nas either the President of the United States or the Governor-General of\r\nCanada is not essential to a federal system. The name \"confederation\" is\r\na wide name, and the things essential to it may be secured in a great\r\nvariety of ways. The foreign policy of a South African Confederation is\r\nperhaps the only point which might raise considerations affecting the\r\ninternational status of the members of the Confederation; and as to\r\nthis, it must be remembered that neither the Orange Free State nor the\r\nTransvaal can come into direct contact with any foreign power except\r\nPortugal, because neither has any access to the sea, or touches (save on\r\nthe eastern border of the Transvaal) any non-British territory.\r\n\r\nAnother remark occurs in this connection. The sentiment of national\r\nindependence which the people of the Free State cherish, and which may\r\nprobably survive in the Transvaal even when that State has passed from a\r\nBoer into an Anglo-Dutch Republic, is capable of being greatly modified\r\nby a better comprehension of the ample freedom which the self-governing\r\nColonies of Britain enjoy. The non-British world is under some\r\nmisconception in this matter, and does not understand that these\r\nColonies are practically democratic Republics, though under the\r\nprotection and dignified by the traditions of an ancient and famous\r\nmonarchy. Nor has it been fully realized that the Colonies derive even\r\ngreater substantial advantages from the connection than does the mother\r\ncountry. The mother country profits perhaps to some extent--though this\r\nis doubtful--in respect of trade, but chiefly in the sentiment of pride\r\nand the consciousness of a great mission in the world which the\r\npossession of these vast territories, scattered over the oceans,\r\nnaturally and properly inspires. The Colonies, on the other hand, have\r\nnot only some economic advantages in the better financial credit they\r\nenjoy, but have the benefit of the British diplomatic and consular\r\nservice all over the world and of the status of British citizens in\r\nevery foreign country. It is also a political convenience to them to be\r\nrelieved by the presence of the Governor whom the mother country sends\r\nout as an executive figure-head of their Cabinet system, from the\r\nnecessity of electing an executive chief, a convenience which those who\r\nknow the trouble occasioned by Presidential elections in the United\r\nStates can best appreciate. And, above all, the British Colonies have\r\nthe navy of Britain to defend them against molestation by any foreign\r\npower. It may be said that they have also the risk of being involved in\r\nany war into which Britain may enter. This risk has, however, never\r\nbecome a reality; for during the last eighty years no Colony has ever\r\nbeen even threatened with attack by a foreign State, while during all\r\nthat time the Colonies have been relieved from the cost and trouble of\r\nmaintaining the naval and military armaments which are needed to ensure\r\ntheir safety. Thus, even leaving sentiment aside, the balance of\r\nmaterial advantage to the Colonies is great and real; while their\r\nself-government is complete, for the mother country never interferes\r\nwith any matters of colonial concern, unless in the rare cases where a\r\nmatter primarily local may affect the general relations and interests of\r\nthe whole empire. When these facts have been fully realized in the Free\r\nState and the Transvaal, it may well be that those States will be ready\r\nto enter a confederation of which the British monarchy would be, as in\r\nCanada and (probably before long) in Australia, the protecting suzerain,\r\nfor there would be in that suzerainty no real infringement of the\r\nindependence which the Free State has so happily enjoyed. It is\r\npremature to speculate now on the best form which a scheme for South\r\nAfrican Confederation may take. All that need here be pointed out is\r\nthat the obstacles now perceived are not insurmountable obstacles, but\r\nsuch as may be overcome by a close study of the conditions of the\r\nproblem, and by reasonable concessions on the part of South African\r\nstatesmen in the different States concerned.\r\n\r\nThese observations are made on the assumption that the South African\r\nColonies will desire to maintain their political connection with the\r\nmother country. It is an assumption which may safely be made, for\r\nnowhere in the British empire is the attachment to Britain more sincere.\r\nStrong as this feeling is in Canada and in Australasia, it is assuredly\r\nno less strong in South Africa. The English there are perhaps even more\r\nEnglish than are the people of those other Colonies. Those of Dutch\r\norigin, warm as is their Africander patriotism, have never been hostile\r\nto the British Crown. And both English and Dutch feel how essential to\r\nthem, placed as they are, is the protection of a great naval power. They\r\nhave as near neighbours in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans two\r\ngreat European powers bent on colonial expansion, and to either of whom,\r\neven apart from colonial expansion, such a position as Simon's Bay or\r\nTable Bay offers would be invaluable. Both the mother country,\r\ntherefore, whose naval and commercial interests require her to retain\r\nthe Cape peninsula, and her South African children, have every motive\r\nfor cleaving to one another, and, so far as our eyes can pierce the\r\nmists of the future, no reason can be discerned why they should not\r\ncontinue so to cleave. The peoples of both countries are altogether\r\nfriendly to one another. But much will depend on the knowledge, the\r\nprudence, the patience, the quiet and unobtrusive tact, of the home\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhile Britain continues to be a great naval power, the maintenance of\r\nher connection with South Africa will ensure the external peace of that\r\ncountry, which, fortunately for herself, lies far away in the southern\r\nseas, with no land frontiers which she is called on to defend. She may\r\nnot grow to be herself as populous and powerful a State as will be the\r\nCanadian or the Australian Confederations of the future, for her\r\nclimatic conditions do not promise so large an increase of the white\r\nrace; but her people may, if she can deal wisely with the problems which\r\nthe existence of the coloured population raises, become a happy and\r\nprosperous nation. They are exempt from some of the dangers which\r\nthreaten the industrial communities of Europe and North America. The\r\nland they dwell in is favoured by nature, and inspires a deep love in\r\nits children. The stock they spring from is strong and sound; and they\r\nhave carried with them to their new home the best traditions of Teutonic\r\nfreedom and self-government.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: I leave the pages that follow as they were written in 1897\r\n(reserving for another place a reference to events which have happened\r\nsince), because I desire that the views therein expressed, which I hold\r\nquite as strongly now as in 1889, should be known to have been formed\r\nand stated before the deplorable events of the last few months (Oct.\r\n1899).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nCONVENTION OF 1881\r\n\r\nCONVENTION FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE TRANSVAAL TERRITORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreamble. Her Majesty's Commissioners for the Settlement of the\r\nTransvaal territory, duly appointed as such by a Commission passed under\r\nthe Royal Sign Manual and Signet, bearing date the 5th of April 1881, do\r\nhereby undertake and guarantee on behalf of Her Majesty, that, from and\r\nafter the 8th day of August 1881, complete self-government, subject to\r\nthe suzerainty of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, will be\r\naccorded to the inhabitants of the Transvaal territory, upon the\r\nfollowing terms and conditions, and subject to the following\r\nreservations and limitations:--\r\n\r\nArticle 1. The said territory, to be herein-after called the Transvaal\r\nState, will embrace the land lying between the following boundaries, to\r\nwit: [Here follow three pages in print defining boundaries].\r\n\r\nArticle 2. Her Majesty reserves to herself, her heirs and successors,\r\n(_a_) the right from time to time to appoint a British Resident in and\r\nfor the said State, with such duties and functions as are herein-after\r\ndefined; (_b_) the right to move troops through the said State in time\r\nof war, or in case of the apprehension of immediate war between the\r\nSuzerain Power and any Foreign State or Native tribe in South Africa;\r\nand (_c_) the control of the external relations of the said State,\r\nincluding the conclusion of treaties and the conduct of diplomatic\r\nintercourse with Foreign Powers, such intercourse to be carried on\r\nthrough Her Majesty's diplomatic and consular officers abroad.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. Until altered by the Volksraad, or other competent authority,\r\nall laws, whether passed before or after the annexation of the\r\nTransvaal territory to Her Majesty's dominions, shall, except in so far\r\nas they are inconsistent with or repugnant to the provisions of this\r\nConvention, be and remain in force in the said State in so far as they\r\nshall be applicable thereto, provided that no future enactment\r\nespecially affecting the interests of natives shall have any force or\r\neffect in the said State, without the consent of Her Majesty, her heirs\r\nand successors, first had and obtained and signified to the Government\r\nof the said State through the British Resident, provided further that in\r\nno case will the repeal or amendment of any laws enacted since the\r\nannexation have a retrospective effect, so as to invalidate any acts\r\ndone or liabilities incurred by virtue of such laws.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. On the 8th day of August 1881, the Government of the said\r\nState, together with all rights and obligations thereto appertaining,\r\nand all State property taken over at the time of annexation, save and\r\nexcept munitions of war, will be handed over to Messrs. Stephanus\r\nJohannes Paulus Kruger, Martinus Wessel Pretorius, and Petrus Jocobus\r\nJoubert, or the survivor or survivors of them, who will forthwith cause\r\na Volksraad to be elected and convened, and the Volksraad, thus elected\r\nand convened, will decide as to the further administration of the\r\nGovernment of the said State.\r\n\r\nArticle 5. All sentences passed upon persons who may be convicted of\r\noffences contrary to the rules of civilized warfare committed during the\r\nrecent hostilities will be duly carried out, and no alteration or\r\nmitigation of such sentences will be made or allowed by the Government\r\nof the Transvaal State without Her Majesty's consent conveyed through\r\nthe British Resident. In case there shall be any prisoners in any of the\r\ngaols of the Transvaal State whose respective sentences of imprisonment\r\nhave been remitted in part by Her Majesty's Administrator or other\r\nofficer administering the Government, such remission will be recognized\r\nand acted upon by the future Government of the said State.\r\n\r\nArticle 6. Her Majesty's Government will make due compensation for all\r\nlosses or damage sustained by reason of such acts as are in the 8th\r\nArticle herein-after specified, which may have been committed by Her\r\nMajesty's forces during the recent hostilities, except for such losses\r\nor damage as may already have been compensated for, and the Government\r\nof the Transvaal State will make due compensation for all losses or\r\ndamage sustained by reason of such acts as are in the 8th Article\r\nherein-after specified which may have been committed by the people who\r\nwere in arms against Her Majesty during the recent hostilities, except\r\nfor such losses or damages as may already have been compensated for.\r\n\r\nArticle 7. The decision of all claims for compensation, as in the last\r\npreceding Article mentioned, will be referred to a Sub-Committee,\r\nconsisting of the Honourable George Hudson, the Honourable Jacobus\r\nPetrus de Wet, and the Honourable John Gilbert Kotze. In case one or\r\nmore of such Sub-Commissioners shall be unable or unwilling to act the\r\nremaining Sub-Commissioner or Sub-Commissioners will, after consultation\r\nwith the Government of the Transvaal State, submit for the approval of\r\nHer Majesty's High Commissioners the names of one or more persons to be\r\nappointed by them to fill the place or places thus vacated. The decision\r\nof the said Sub-Commissioners, or of a majority of them, will be final.\r\nThe said Sub-Commissioners will enter upon and perform their duties with\r\nall convenient speed. They will, before taking evidence or ordering\r\nevidence to be taken in respect of any claim, decide whether such claim\r\ncan be entertained at all under the rules laid down in the next\r\nsucceeding Article. In regard to claims which can be so entertained, the\r\nSub-Commissioners will, in the first instance, afford every facility for\r\nan amicable arrangement as to the amount payable in respect of any\r\nclaim, and only in cases in which there is no reasonable ground for\r\nbelieving that an immediate amicable arrangement can be arrived at will\r\nthey take evidence or order evidence to be taken. For the purpose of\r\ntaking evidence and reporting thereon, the Sub-Commissioners may appoint\r\nDeputies, who will, without delay, submit records of the evidence and\r\ntheir reports to the Sub-Commissioners. The Sub-Commissioners will\r\narrange their sittings and the sittings of their Deputies in such a\r\nmanner as to afford the earliest convenience to the parties concerned\r\nand their witnesses. In no case will costs be allowed to either side,\r\nother than the actual and reasonable expenses of witnesses whose\r\nevidence is certified by the Sub-Commissioners to have been necessary.\r\nInterest will not run on the amount of any claim, except as is\r\nherein-after provided for. The said Sub-Commissioners will forthwith,\r\nafter deciding upon any claim, announce their decision to the Government\r\nagainst which the award is made and to the claimant. The amount of\r\nremuneration payable to the Sub-Commissioners and their Deputies will be\r\ndetermined by the High Commissioners. After all the claims have been\r\ndecided upon, the British Government and the Government of the Transvaal\r\nState will pay proportionate shares of the said remuneration and of the\r\nexpenses of the Sub-Commissioners and their Deputies, according to the\r\namount awarded against them respectively.\r\n\r\nArticle 8. For the purpose of distinguishing claims to be accepted from\r\nthose to be rejected, the Sub-Commissioners will be guided by the\r\nfollowing rules, viz: Compensation will be allowed for losses or damage\r\nsustained by reason of the following acts committed during the recent\r\nhostilities, viz., (_a_) commandeering, seizure, confiscation, or\r\ndestruction of property, or damage done to property; (_b_) violence done\r\nor threats used by persons in arms. In regard to acts under (_a_),\r\ncompensation will be allowed for direct losses only. In regard to acts\r\nfalling under (_b_) compensation will be allowed for actual losses of\r\nproperty, or actual injury to the same proved to have been caused by its\r\nenforced abandonment. No claims for indirect losses, except such as are\r\nin this Article specially provided for, will be entertained. No claims\r\nwhich have been handed in to the Secretary of the Royal Commission after\r\nthe 1st day of July 1881 will be entertained, unless the\r\nSub-Commissioners shall be satisfied that the delay was reasonable. When\r\nclaims for loss of property are considered, the Sub-Commissioners will\r\nrequire distinct proof of the existence of the property, and that it\r\nneither has reverted nor will revert to the claimant.\r\n\r\nArticle 9. The Government of the Transvaal State will pay and satisfy\r\nthe amount of every claim awarded against it within one month after the\r\nSub-Commissioners shall have notified their decision to the said\r\nGovernment, and in default of such payment the said Government will pay\r\ninterest at the rate of six per cent. per annum from the date of such\r\ndefault; but Her Majesty's Government may at any time before such\r\npayment pay the amount, with interest, if any, to the claimant in\r\nsatisfaction of his claim, and may add the sum thus paid to any debt\r\nwhich may be due by the Transvaal State to Her Majesty's Government, as\r\nherein-after provided for.\r\n\r\nArticle 10. The Transvaal State will be liable for the balance of the\r\ndebts for which the South African Republic was liable at the date of\r\nannexation, to wit, the sum of 48,000_l._ in respect of the Cape\r\nCommercial Bank Loan, and 85,667_l._ in respect to the Railway Loan,\r\ntogether with the amount due on 8th August 1881 on account of the Orphan\r\nChamber Debt, which now stands at 22,200_l._, which debts will be a\r\nfirst charge upon the revenues of the State. The Transvaal State will,\r\nmoreover, be liable for the lawful expenditure lawfully incurred for the\r\nnecessary expenses of the Province since the annexation, to wit, the sum\r\nof 265,000_l._, which debt, together with such debts as may be incurred\r\nby virtue of the 9th Article, will be second charge upon the revenues of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nArticle 11. The debts due as aforesaid by the Transvaal State to Her\r\nMajesty's Government will bear interest at the rate of three and a half\r\nper cent., and any portion of such debt as may remain unpaid at the\r\nexpiration of twelve months from the 8th August 1881 shall be repayable\r\nby a payment for interest and sinking fund of six pounds and ninepence\r\nper cent. per annum, which will extinguish the debt in twenty-five\r\nyears. The said payment of six pounds and ninepence per 100_l._ shall be\r\npayable half yearly in British currency on the 8th February and 8th\r\nAugust in each year. Provided always that the Transvaal State shall pay\r\nin reduction of the said debt the sum of 100,000_l._ within twelve\r\nmonths of the 8th August 1881, and shall be at liberty at the close of\r\nany half year to pay off the whole or any portion of the outstanding\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nArticle 12. All persons holding property in the said State on the 8th\r\nday of August 1881 will continue after the said date to enjoy the rights\r\nof property which they have enjoyed since the annexation. No person who\r\nhas remained loyal to Her Majesty during the recent hostilities shall\r\nsuffer any molestation by reason of his loyalty, or be liable to any\r\ncriminal prosecution or civil action for any part taken in connexion\r\nwith such hostilities, and all such persons will have full liberty to\r\nreside in the country, with enjoyment of all civil rights, and\r\nprotection for their persons and property.\r\n\r\nArticle 13. Natives will be allowed to acquire land, but the grant or\r\ntransfer of such land will, in every case, be made to and registered in\r\nthe name of the Native Location Commission, herein-after mentioned, in\r\ntrust for such natives.\r\n\r\nArticle 14. Natives will be allowed to move as freely within the country\r\nas may be consistent with the requirements of public order, and to leave\r\nit for the purpose of seeking employment elsewhere or for other lawful\r\npurposes, subject always to the pass laws of the said State, as amended\r\nby the Legislature of the Province, or as may hereafter be enacted under\r\nthe provisions of the Third Article of this Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 15. There will continue to be complete freedom of religion and\r\nprotection from molestation for all denominations, provided the same be\r\nnot inconsistent with morality and good order, and no disability shall\r\nattach to any person in regard to rights of property by reason of the\r\nreligious opinions which he holds.\r\n\r\nArticle 16. The provisions of the Fourth Article of the Sand River\r\nConvention are hereby re-affirmed, and no slavery or apprenticeship\r\npartaking of slavery will be tolerated by the Government of the said\r\nState.\r\n\r\nArticle 17. The British Resident will receive from the Government of the\r\nTransvaal State such assistance and support as can by law be given to\r\nhim for the due discharge of his functions, he will also receive every\r\nassistance for the proper care and preservation of the graves of such of\r\nHer Majesty's forces as have died in the Transvaal, and if need be for\r\nthe expropriation of land for the purpose.\r\n\r\nArticle 18. The following will be the duties and functions of the\r\nBritish Resident:--Sub-section 1, he will perform duties and functions\r\nanalogous to those discharged by a Chargé d'Affaires and Consul-General.\r\n\r\nSub-section 2. In regard to natives within the Transvaal State he will\r\n(_a_) report to the High Commissioner, as representative of the\r\nSuzerain, as to the working and observance of the provisions of this\r\nConvention; (_b_) report to the Transvaal authorities any cases of\r\nill-treatment of natives or attempts to incite natives to rebellion that\r\nmay come to his knowledge; (_c_) use his influence with the natives in\r\nfavour of law and order; and (_d_) generally perform such other duties\r\nas are by this Convention entrusted to him, and take such steps for the\r\nprotection of the person and property of natives as are consistent with\r\nthe laws of the land.\r\n\r\nSub-section 3.

In regard to communications with foreign powers, the\r\nTransvaal Government will correspond with Her Majesty's Government\r\nthrough the British Resident and the High Commissioner.\r\n\r\nArticle 19. The Government of the Transvaal State will strictly adhere\r\nto the boundaries defined in the First Article of this Convention, and\r\nwill do its utmost to prevent any of its inhabitants from making any\r\nencroachment upon lands beyond the said State. The Royal Commission will\r\nforthwith appoint a person who will beacon off the boundary line between\r\nRamatlabama and the point where such line first touches Griqualand West\r\nboundary, midway between the Vaal and Hart rivers; the person so\r\nappointed will be instructed to make an arrangement between the owners\r\nof the farms Grootfontein and Valleifontein on the one hand, and the\r\nBarolong authorities on the other, by which a fair share of the water\r\nsupply of the said farms shall be allowed to flow undisturbed to the\r\nsaid Barolongs.\r\n\r\nArticle 20. All grants or titles issued at any time by the Transvaal\r\nGovernment in respect of land outside the boundary of Transvaal State,\r\nas defined, Article 1, shall be considered invalid and of no effect,\r\nexcept in so far as any such grant or title relates to land that falls\r\nwithin the boundary of the Transvaal State, and all persons holding any\r\nsuch grant so considered invalid and of no effect will receive from the\r\nGovernment of the Transvaal State such compensation either in land or in\r\nmoney as the Volksraad shall determine. In all cases in which any native\r\nchiefs or other authorities outside the said boundaries have received\r\nany adequate consideration from the Government of the former South\r\nAfrican Republic for land excluded from the Transvaal by the First\r\nArticle of this Convention, or where permanent improvements have been\r\nmade on the land the British Resident will, subject to the approval of\r\nthe High Commissioner, use his influence to recover from the native\r\nauthorities fair compensation for the loss of the land thus excluded,\r\nand of the permanent improvement thereon.\r\n\r\nArticle 21. Forthwith, after the taking effect of this Convention, a\r\nNative Location Commission will be constituted, consisting of the\r\nPresident, or in his absence the Vice-President of the State, or some\r\none deputed by him, the Resident, or some one deputed by him, and a\r\nthird person to be agreed upon by the President or the Vice-President,\r\nas the case may be, and the Resident, and such Commission will be a\r\nstanding body for the performance of the duties herein-after mentioned.\r\n\r\nArticle 22.

In case land already granted in individual titles shall be\r\nrequired for the purpose of any location, the owners will receive such\r\ncompensation either in other land or in money as the Volksraad shall\r\ndetermine. After the boundaries of any location have been fixed, no\r\nfresh grant of land within such location will be made, nor will the\r\nboundaries be altered without the consent of the Location Commission. No\r\nfresh grants of land will be made in the districts of Waterbergh,\r\nZoutspansberg, and Lydenburg until the locations in the said districts\r\nrespectively shall have been defined by the said Commission.\r\n\r\nArticle 23.

No grants of land which may have been made, and no transfer\r\nof mortgage which may have been passed since the annexation, will be\r\ninvalidated by reason merely of their having been made or passed since\r\nthat date. All transfers to the British Secretary for Native Affairs in\r\ntrust for natives will remain in force, the Native Location Commission\r\ntaking the place of such Secretary for Native Affairs.\r\n\r\nArticle 32. This Convention will be ratified by a newly-elected\r\nVolksraad within the period of three months after its execution, and in\r\ndefault of such ratification this Convention shall be null and void.\r\n\r\nArticle 33.
