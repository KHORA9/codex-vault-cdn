NW COULD MEAN NOWHERE                                           12\r\n      North West is the only section of Washington which\r\n      counts. On the other hand, what is there in it you won’t\r\n      find in Denver, Detroit or Dubuque, except the White\r\n      House?\r\n\r\n   4. NOT-SO-TENDER TENDERLOIN                                        21\r\n      Where the hustlers hustle.\r\n\r\n   5.

We call those in\r\n      Washington traitors.\r\n\r\n  17. KICKING THE GONG AROUND                                        107\r\n      When we speak of hopheads, we don’t mean Congressmen.\r\n\r\n  18. THE YOUNG IN HEART                                             118\r\n      Until we read this book we liked children. In Washington\r\n      the little dears are devils.\r\n\r\n  19.

Being the story of the Social\r\n      Climbers who climbed in when SOCIETY climbed out.\r\n\r\n  22. STRIPED PANTS                                                  144\r\n      Elsewhere men who wear ’em bury the dead; in Washington\r\n      most who wear them are dead but not buried.\r\n      That’s the sad tale of what happened to the once oh, so\r\n      gay diplomatic corps.\r\n\r\n  23. LOBBYIST’S LICENSE--THE RIGHT TO PETITION                      155\r\n      The population consists of so many five percenters,\r\n      lobbyists, fixers, lawyers, press agents and men from\r\n      Missouri, you’d think everyone was taking advantage of the\r\n      Constitutional guarantee.\r\n\r\n  24. RACKETS BY REMOTE CONTROL                                      171\r\n      Washington’s underworld is operated by local overseers\r\n      for absentee landlords.

We turned\r\nChicago upside down; but we were both raised there. We descended on\r\nWashington not quite like Stanley invaded Africa, because in our\r\ncombined 75 years of newspaper work we had been in the capital hundreds\r\nof times. It intrigued us because we never could understand it. So we\r\ndecided brashly to do a Lait-Mortimer operation on it from scratch. Our\r\nprincipal discovery was that nobody understands Washington--the _city_,\r\nnot the nation’s nerve-center.\r\n\r\nBy the time we went through it--its avenues, its alleys, its\r\ncat-houses, its dumps, its mansions, its hotels, its police stations,\r\nits jails, its courts, its clubs, its closets, and its catacombs, we\r\nknew more about it than anyone who lives in it, and finished the job\r\nwhich stymied Lincoln Steffens 40 years ago; for that classic muckraker\r\nwho turned up the shame of the cities recoiled in bafflement when he\r\nattempted to “do” Washington.\r\n\r\nIt was our toughest task of digging, but we turned up plenty. We think\r\nwe have X-rayed the dizziest--and this will amaze you, as it did us,\r\nthe dirtiest--community in America.\r\n\r\nWe are not reformers. We are reporters. As such we will take you with\r\nus through a metropolitan area of 1,500,000, living in what should be\r\na utopia, but which is a cesspool of drunkenness, debauchery, whoring,\r\nhomosexuality, municipal corruption and public apathy, protected crime\r\nunder criminal protection, hoodlumism, racketeering, pandering and\r\nplundering, among anomalous situations found nowhere else on earth.\r\n\r\nWashington is a made-to-order architectural paradise with the political\r\nstatus of an Indian reservation, inhabited by 800,000 economic\r\nparasites; no industries but one, government, and the tradesmen and\r\nservants and loafers and scum that feed on the highest average per\r\ncapita income in the world, where exist the soundest security, the\r\nmightiest power, and the most superlative rates of crime, vice and\r\njuvenile delinquency anywhere. And this in a seat of intelligence, the\r\ncross-section of the whole United States, where women far outnumber men.\r\n\r\nIt leads the country in the percentage of the native-born. There are\r\nno peasants, factory-workers or slums as they are known in every other\r\ncity of magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe paternal form of local administration in this disenfranchised and\r\npolitically castrated community should eliminate ward and district\r\nbosses, vote-buyers, grafters and gangsters, all of whom elsewhere\r\nthrive primarily on controlling votes. Yet in this magnificent planned\r\ncity of majestic proportions, the official heart of the richest and\r\ngreatest and freest land in the history of mankind, we found corruption\r\nand perversion, organized and individual, that dazed a pair of hardened\r\ncharacters who considered themselves shock-proof after their groundwork\r\nfor the books that debunked New York and deloused Chicago.\r\n\r\nWe spent many months in Washington. We made contacts in our own\r\nsurefire way, which opened up sources not usually available to the\r\nreporters there, who regard affairs of their town as chickenfeed, and\r\nwho dream of becoming syndicated columnists who can pontificate on\r\nCongress, the Cabinet and the White House.\r\n\r\nWe know plenty about those, too. But we will stick to the Lowdown on\r\nthe Big Town, which has become our trademark.\r\n\r\nWe will not even attempt to be comprehensive. We have no hope or aim to\r\nmake Washington a better place to live in. We don’t give a damn what\r\nkind of a place it is to live in, except that the kind of place we\r\nfound furnished us with that sole commodity in which we deal--copy.\r\n\r\nEverything interested us, but we will limit this to what we think will\r\ninterest you. This is no guide-book. This is no preachment and no\r\nappeal, not even a lesson. As we said in the introduction to _Chicago\r\nConfidential_, “We have nothing to sell except books.” And we sold\r\nplenty of them and are still selling them.\r\n\r\nThis will be the stripped-down story of a queen who turned into a\r\nstreet-walker.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we were born--to tell you what you couldn’t find out without\r\nus--Confidential!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART ONE\r\n\r\nTHE PLACES\r\n\r\n(_Confidential!_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DISTRICT OF CONFUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nation’s Capital is a bastard born of a compromise and nurtured on\r\na lottery.\r\n\r\nThe founding fathers, whose infinite wisdom gave us a Constitution\r\nand form of government well nigh perfect, located the seat of that\r\ngovernment in a stinking, steaming swamp. This was a peace offering to\r\nrecalcitrant Southerners, who were that way then just as they are now.\r\n\r\nThe first funds to build and improve that city were raised by selling\r\nreal estate by lottery. With such ancestry, it is no wonder today that\r\n“numbers” make one of the biggest businesses in Washington. The policy\r\nracket far exceeds bookmaking, the Number 1 source of gambling revenue\r\nin all others parts of the country.\r\n\r\nBefore the plane which brings the arriving traveler to Washington lands\r\nat the National Airport, on the Virginia side, it swoops gracefully\r\nover the city in a salute. The tall, needle-like Washington Monument\r\nand the familiar dome of the Capitol arise through a sea of green, to\r\ndominate the landscape.\r\n\r\nThey and the other public structures, which alone form the skyline in\r\na city where buildings over 110 feet high are banned by law, are the\r\nsymbols of Washington. It is an old-fashioned, tree-shaded Southern\r\ntown, delightful and gracious, taken over by a gigantic governmental\r\napparatus which, though founded on Colonial Virginia’s tradition\r\nof personal freedom, has mushroomed into the world’s greatest\r\nbureaucracy, humpbacked and bow-legged under tons of laws and endless\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nThe spacious avenues, the tree-shaded lawns, the green which one sees\r\nwherever he looks, is a symbol too--that Washington is dominated by the\r\nrural mind.\r\n\r\nIt is the only capital of any world power where there is no variety\r\nof humanity. London, Paris, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, these are\r\ngreat commercial centers where national government is incidental.\r\nWashington is inhabited by residents of every state in the union and\r\nrepresentatives of every country on the globe, yet it is as backwater\r\nand provincial as any small inland one-plant town.\r\n\r\nThis most uncosmopolitan capital is overshadowed by that giant of\r\nmetropolises, New York, only minutes away by air, and by Baltimore,\r\nwith its wide open and blatant vice much nearer. The foreign trade\r\ncommissioners, the visiting bankers, and all the important public\r\npersonages go to Manhattan, where the United Nations is cutting into\r\nWashington’s diplomatic monopoly. The lowlier links lam the 36 miles to\r\nBaltimore to cut up.\r\n\r\nNot that Washington has no vice and venery. It has more of it than the\r\nescape havens. But, as in all ingrown towns, the “respectables” must go\r\naway from home to prance and play. It is the story of the deacon from\r\nDubuque all over again, and what happens to him in the Big Burg. Only\r\nhere the deacon is a Congressman, or--\r\n\r\nAs we unfold the rates of crime, vice, sex irregularities, graft, cheap\r\ngambling, drunkenness, rowdyism and rackets, you will get, thrown on a\r\nlarge screen, a peep show of this stately concentration camp of cold\r\nmonuments and hot mammas where there are four women for every three\r\nmen. Murkier than the “smoke-filled room” so often used as a cliché to\r\ntypify a corral of politicos, it is a vast bedroom with a jumbo bottle\r\nof bourbon beside the bed.\r\n\r\nAnd yet its manners and morals are those of the barnyard and the\r\nrailroad-junction town rather than the romantic intrigue of the salon\r\nand the scented boudoir.\r\n\r\nWashington has a kind of glamor all its own. It is not the kind one\r\nfinds in New York, or Paris, or even Atlantic City. The Washington\r\nfeeling comes from being close to great events and to the memory of\r\ngreat people. It is, to a certain extent, similar to the public appeal\r\nof Hollywood’s famed Forest Lawn Cemetery, the place where the movie\r\nstars are interred. Forest Lawn there is a must for tourists. There is\r\nno sacred peace about this graveyard. Trippers photograph its ornate\r\ntombs and profane its dead. The tombs were purposely designed by hams\r\nwho craved publicity even in death.\r\n\r\nWashington does remind one of a well-kept cemetery. Its gleaming public\r\nbuildings of white marble are like so many mausoleums. It is the\r\nnation’s Forest Lawn, where is sunk its priceless heritage, killed by\r\ncountless generations of getters and gimme-ers.\r\n\r\nWashington is a reflection of Los Angeles--a Los Angeles without palm\r\ntrees. Where it doesn’t look like a cemetery it resembles a movie set.\r\nIt has a feel of unreality. This is a designed city, the only important\r\none in America, and its streets are so straight, its architecture is so\r\nconforming, and its sidewalks are so neat and clean, it might have been\r\nset up in _papier-mâché_ only today.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s a dead heat which--Washington or Los Angeles--has more yahoos\r\nfrom more dull places. New York gets its share, but its tourists\r\ninclude many from fairly alive communities; the plowboys hail from\r\nNew England or other points not very far away. But the barbarians\r\nwho inundate Washington and Los Angeles would be conspicuous if they\r\nvisited Little Rock. Heaven knows where they come from. Their clothes,\r\nmake-ups, manners and expressions are of the cow-pasture.\r\n\r\nWe were sitting in the Senators’ Reception Room in the Capitol, waiting\r\nfor one solon to come off the floor. This rococo room is open to the\r\npublic. While we sat there, we idly contemplated the sight-seers\r\nwho gaped at the mid-Victorian gold and mosaic with which it is\r\nembellished. One coatless yokel, with two dirty-nosed youngsters in tow\r\nand a dreary wife toting a wailing babe bringing up the rear, figured\r\nwe knew something because we were wearing ties and sitting down.\r\n\r\n“What room is this?” he humbly asked.\r\n\r\n“This is the President’s private office,” we replied. “No visitors\r\nallowed.”\r\n\r\nYou should have seen them scram!\r\n\r\nThe number of transients who enter and leave Washington annually is in\r\nexcess of 45 million. Most of them are peasants who shudder when they\r\nride in an elevator and gape at an escalator. The sessions of Congress\r\nfind them in the galleries of the noisy House and the sedate Senate.\r\nThe men are negligee with firemen’s suspenders, the women often suckle\r\nbabes at their breasts while some Demosthenes below debates a bill\r\nvital to the world.\r\n\r\nBut the residents of the Washington area are, on the whole, remarkably\r\nwell-dressed--not only the natives in Washington but the government\r\nemployes drawn from every corner of the map. It is surprising how\r\nquickly they shed their corn-fed looks and begin to look like\r\nEasterners and try to act like them.\r\n\r\nOne wonders where the hoards of ill-dressed, low-mannered visitors eat\r\nand sleep.\r\n\r\nTourists may wander coatless through the White House and in the\r\nlegislative office buildings, but all of the better restaurants and\r\nhotels require men to wear coats and ties at all times. This, of\r\ncourse, is universal in New York, but in Chicago, horny-handed, wilted\r\nhoi polloi are seen in lobbies of such swell hotels as the Ambassador\r\nand Drake in shirt-sleeves.\r\n\r\nWashingtonians are completely white-collar. Its private business\r\nis merchandising. The service trades, such as feeding and sleeping\r\nvisitors, form its chief non-governmental activity. Before the New Deal\r\nput a premium on alphabet soup, federal employes got miserly wages.\r\nWashington was a poor city. Now some secretaries make as much as $8,000\r\na year and Senators’ assistants drag down $10,000. We talked to one\r\nbabe, some kind of an expert in the Treasury, who draws $15,000 a year\r\non a fee basis. In her spare time she checks hats in a joint which\r\nsells liquor after hours.\r\n\r\nThe average family income in Washington is the highest in any big city\r\nin the land, despite its disproportionate Negro population. Colored\r\nfolk work for Uncle Sam at salaries equal to whites’, in many cases get\r\npreferential treatment, and others draw liberal relief checks. Another\r\nreason for high family income is that in so many families husband and\r\nwife work for the government, and many who are grounded there also\r\nhold outside jobs, after hours. This practice is permitted in many\r\ndepartments. Even members of the Metropolitan Police are allowed to\r\naccept outside employment after their eight-hour day. Many drive taxies\r\nor are chauffeurs.\r\n\r\nThe per capita income in Washington is $1820, compared with the\r\nnational average of $1330. Even rich New York is second to Washington\r\nwith $1758.\r\n\r\nWashingtonians file more income-tax returns per capita than do any\r\nother Americans. More than two-thirds of the homes in the District\r\nare worth more than $12,000. The city has the highest retail sales per\r\ncapita on earth. Government employes are paid regularly by a boss who\r\nnever goes broke--though that isn’t the fault of the politicians.\r\n\r\nAdded wealth streams constantly into the city, from the cornucopias of\r\nlobbyists with no-limit expense accounts, tourists and representatives\r\nof foreign governments who let loose a few francs, shillings or lire\r\nbefore tapping our tills.\r\n\r\nHere we have a city which, if mental cripples who believe in planned\r\neconomies were correct, should be a happy place, free of crime and\r\nvice. Washington is rich and almost everyone in it is insured against\r\nwant for life. Yet it has that apex rate of crime. The waterfront of\r\nMarseilles, the alleys of Singapore’s Chinatown, the sailor’s deadfalls\r\nof Port Said have nothing on it. Washington makes even Chicago look\r\ngood. And that’s been going on since Abigail Adams hung the family wash\r\nin the backyard of the then unfinished White House--and shuddered lest\r\nthe President’s drawers be stolen.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the Republic, grifters and grafters, highwaymen\r\nand conmen, pimps and prostitutes flocked into the city. Instead of\r\nbeing a community where women greatly outnumbered men, as they do\r\ntoday, early Washington contained almost entirely males. The first\r\nCongressmen and early office-holders were easy pickings for the fancy\r\ngirls and their fancy men, who arrived a jump ahead of the lobbyists.\r\nLonesome men whiled their time at cards and dice, and ever since then\r\nWashington has been a gamblers’ garden.\r\n\r\nForeigners and many American political philosophers say one great fault\r\nof our American system is our form of municipal government. They point\r\nout the astounding crime, legal laxity and municipal deviltry in this\r\ncountry where we elect our local governments directly and give them\r\ngreat power, whereas most foreign countries are ruled from above, with\r\ncities and provinces allowed minimum authority.\r\n\r\nWell, Washington is ruled from above. It has no votes, no county\r\nchairmen, no campaign funds to be raised, no favors to be returned. It\r\nis policed by a constabulary appointed directly by the United States\r\ngovernment and paid from the public treasury of the United States.\r\nIts judges are appointed by the President with the consent of the\r\nSenate, and all but municipal court judges serve for life. Its District\r\nAttorney is chosen by the President, as are its city commissioners,\r\nand through them all public District officials.\r\n\r\nThere is no chance for a neighborhood gang boss to establish himself\r\nthrough floaters and colonized flotsam. Yet there are neighborhood\r\nbosses. There is influence. Judges and police are bought. Washington\r\nhas the blackest record of any city in the country on the F.B.I. ledger\r\nof reported crimes. Black is the color of its crime, too, as will be\r\nshown. The proportion of Negro crime to white is almost eight to one.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for Washington’s defiance of the law which is made in\r\nWashington is that, except for ogling tourists, everyone who comes\r\ncomes to get. To get jobs, contracts, favors, pardons, commissions, and\r\nsometimes social preferment. This acquisitive horde is not interested\r\nin the city. Toward local public affairs there is lethargy of mind,\r\nspirit and body, nothing conducive to enterprise or local pride.\r\n\r\nThis potpourri of human beings on the make remained within bounds until\r\nthe first World War. There was room for all. As every schoolboy knows,\r\nthe original grant of land from the states of Maryland and Virginia for\r\nthe national capital was a square, ten miles wide. This proved too big\r\nand the Virginia part was receded more than a hundred years ago. The\r\nremaining area, all in Maryland, was ample for the needs of the city\r\nuntil overnight, in 1917, it changed from a country town to a madhouse\r\nin which all the residents are inmates. There was some respite during\r\nthe 1920’s, but since the coming of the New Deal, Washington burst its\r\npants and overflowed back into Virginia and across into Maryland.\r\n\r\nAs with other large cities, the 1950 census returns found the rate\r\nof growth of Washington suburbs far outstripping the parent. At this\r\nwriting there are about 800,000 people in the city limits and 750,000\r\nin the satellite suburbs of Virginia and Maryland. The percentage of\r\nNegroes is higher than it is in Mississippi.\r\n\r\nSeniority rules in the Congress, which permit one-party Southern\r\nSenators and Representatives to control more than their share\r\nof committees, account for continuance of its Dixie slant. So\r\nWashingtonians talk like Southerners. Even the Oregonians and\r\ndown-Easters fall into the liquid drawl after a few years in the\r\ncapital. With the dulcet Dixie dialect comes the Southern attitude\r\ntoward the Negro. Fiery FEPCers from New York, after a couple of\r\nyears’ indoctrination, wink in private over the “tolerance” they sell\r\nin public. As Negroes move in the whites flee out.\r\n\r\nAs residents of Virginia and Maryland, these automatically gain\r\nthe votes they surrendered or never had. Though still employed in\r\nWashington, they lose all interest in its municipal affairs. They live,\r\nvote, pay taxes, send their children to school and join churches beyond\r\nthe borders.\r\n\r\nAnd, as the Negro immigrates and propagates, Washington’s chance of\r\never getting the vote dwindles. Even Northern congressmen, with huge\r\nNegro voting constituencies at home, won’t burn their hands with\r\nsuch legislation. They declare for the principles of home rule, sign\r\npetitions to withdraw bottled-up home-rule bills from committees, then\r\nsecretly withdraw their names.\r\n\r\nAs these pages unfold you will get a picture of how more than 1,500,000\r\npeople live. Few would stand for some of Washington’s nauseating\r\nconditions in their own towns. Yet they take them here complacently.\r\nCongressmen, the lords of the city, shrug at what would throw them out\r\nof office if the good burghers in Beloit or Boonetown suspected--and\r\ncared.\r\n\r\nWashington has a heritage of “everybody’s business is nobody’s\r\nbusiness.” But the stimulation which sparks its evils is different,\r\nthough the result is the same.\r\n\r\nOf old, Congress didn’t worry about local crime because all the people\r\ncould do about it was write letters to the papers. But now, since crime\r\nis nationally syndicated, some legislators actively protect Washington\r\ncrime, because it means more funds back in their bailiwicks from the\r\nbranches of the swelling Syndicate of silk-lined racketeers who are\r\nallied with Washington’s criminals.\r\n\r\nSo this is the nation’s capital: with its panderers and prostitutes;\r\ngamblers and gunmen; conmen and Congressmen; lawmakers and\r\nlaw-breakers; fairies and Fair Dealers.\r\n\r\nIt is a city of moods, even drearier when Congress is away campaigning\r\nor vacationing; yet it turns electric when something big is about to\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nIt is a city of the wistful little people with adding-machine minds.\r\n\r\nOver all, a feeling of fear pervades it. People become conditioned to\r\ntalking in whispers. Senators will walk you to the middle of the room,\r\nthen mumble, even when what they have to say is inconsequential. The\r\nmain indoor sport is conspiracy.\r\n\r\nWe give you Washington: not the city of statesmen, but the stateless\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. “GORGEOUS” GEORGETOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall begin this catalog of places with Georgetown, by far the\r\noldest in the city.\r\n\r\nNot all who reside in Georgetown are rich, red or queer, nor do all\r\nWashington millionaires, Commies and/or fags dwell in Georgetown.\r\n\r\nBut if you know anyone who fulfills at least two of the foregoing three\r\nqualifications don’t take odds he doesn’t prance behind Early American\r\nshutters in a reconditioned stable or slave-pen in this unique city\r\nwithin a city.\r\n\r\nGeorgetown was a thriving Colonial village when the rest of the\r\nDistrict was swampland. It was included in the District of Columbia\r\nfrom the time of the original grant, but Georgetown remained an\r\nindependent municipality until 1895.\r\n\r\nIf you like that kind of stuff, Georgetown, which lies in the extreme\r\nNW section of the city, has a charm all its own.\r\n\r\nSome people like the smell of dead fish in Provincetown. Others like\r\nto climb up four flights of stairs to ratty garrets in Greenwich\r\nVillage. Georgetown is quaint that way, too. Now all this is to be\r\npreserved for posterity forever, through an act of Congress setting up\r\na commission to keep it looking the way it is under penalty of the law\r\nfor modernizing anything in the community without the permission of\r\nsome bureaucrat.\r\n\r\nUntil twenty years ago, Georgetown was just another rundown backwash\r\nin a great city. Most of its residents were Negroes. Most of its real\r\nestate wasn’t even good enough for Southern Negroes, and don’t forget\r\nthat a Southern Negro is forced to live almost anywhere. New Dealers\r\nand the bright young braintrusters from Harvard reversed what seems to\r\nbe a foreordained rule in every city in the country. In other words,\r\nthe whites drove the Negroes out--as many as they could--and took over\r\nfor themselves what was practically a blighted area.\r\n\r\nThis is how it came about: When Washington was suddenly flooded with a\r\nhorde of crackpots from the campuses, Communists, ballet-dancers and\r\neconomic planners, there was no place for them to live. They abhorred\r\nthe modern service apartments. These people were “intellectual.” The\r\nwomen wore flat-heeled shoes and batik blouses, and went in for New\r\nThought. The men, if you could call some of them that, wore their hair\r\nlonger than we do, read advanced literature, and talked about the joys\r\nof collectivism, though all of them were so individual they couldn’t\r\nbear to live in skyscrapers.\r\n\r\nMost of these people had dough. The others got good government jobs,\r\nbecame “contact men” or spoke at meetings and wrote for publications\r\nsponsored by rich left-wingers to provide automobiles and other\r\nluxuries for the needier pinks.\r\n\r\nWashington had nothing like New York’s Greenwich Village, but in the\r\nearly days of the New Deal Mrs. Roosevelt herself, during one of the\r\nfleeting moments she was in Washington, “discovered” Georgetown and\r\nconceived it as a genteel bohemian community where her sandal-shod\r\nfriends could find congenial company. She wouldn’t allow the WPA to\r\nalter anything though sewage comes up from the river. Georgetown is\r\noverrun with rats, which frequently chew up Negro infants.\r\n\r\nAncient wooden houses, much the worse for the wear of centuries, which\r\ncould have been bought lot-and-all for $2,500 in the ’20s, skyrocketed\r\nas it became “smart” for society to move to Georgetown. Some properties\r\nare now worth twenty times what they brought twenty years ago, though\r\nterrible odors emanate from a nearby slaughter house.\r\n\r\nFollowing the discovery of Georgetown, the truly gentle Negroes who had\r\nlived there, some for a hundred years or more, were driven out. Few\r\nowned their homes. Into rickety structures which had once housed as\r\nmany as ten Negro families--seventy-five people--moved one millionaire\r\nleft-wing carpetbagger and his wife. With improvements, naturally.\r\nEquality is okay to talk about. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were\r\nspent on some of these homes, modernizing, beautifying, disinfecting\r\nand furnishing them. Now they have house-and-garden tours for visiting\r\nKiwanians.\r\n\r\nNot all the Negroes could be ousted. Even today, Georgetown has\r\na considerable colored population, though it is the only part of\r\nWashington where there are fewer Negroes than there were twenty years\r\nago. Those who remain live in shanties so undesirable that no rich\r\nwhite fairies can be found who want to turn them into something gay. In\r\nfact, there’s a saying in Georgetown now that you’re not “smart” unless\r\ndarkies live next door to you.\r\n\r\nThe sight-seeing buses point out historic Prospect House, now used\r\nby the government for visiting notables, but they don’t show you the\r\ntumble-down Negro shacks behind it.\r\n\r\nOne of Georgetown’s most distinguished residents is Dean Acheson.\r\nEmmitt Warring, king of Washington’s gamblers, about whom more will be\r\nfound in succeeding chapters, is in business nearby.\r\n\r\nWarring is the kingfish of Georgetown. He controls its local police\r\nprecinct as well as its local crime. As will be shown, he has direct\r\naffiliations with the national underworld syndicate.\r\n\r\nEleanor Roosevelt gave Georgetown that first big impetus after her son,\r\nJimmy, who didn’t “got it” in California, moved across the street from\r\nthe old Imperial Russian Embassy, in the 3200 block of Q Street. It\r\nlooked like good business to build up the area.\r\n\r\nSoon the section filled up with all manner of strange people. Many of\r\nthese were buddies of the First Lady. We have seen a letter she wrote\r\nto one Ben Grey, in which she pats such types on the head.\r\n\r\nOne of the queerest sights visible anywhere is the one from a window\r\non the second floor of Dean Acheson’s quaint home at 2805 P Street. It\r\nfaces the 28th Street side over a back yard. The Secretary’s personal\r\nlavatory faces that way. His mind apparently weighted by cosmos-shaking\r\naffairs of state, the secretary forgets to draw down the shade.\r\n\r\nIt is on the second floor, and Acheson doesn’t know he can be seen.\r\nThis is to tip him off to what the whole neighborhood knows, first-hand\r\nand not confidential.\r\n\r\nIn the next block lives Justice Frankfurter. He and Acheson, fresh air\r\nfiends, walk to town every morning.\r\n\r\nAnother neighbor is Myrna Loy, out of films while on a special mission\r\nfor the State Department. She is developing a “new type propaganda\r\ncampaign.” Well, she played enough spy roles in the movies.\r\n\r\nGeorgetown is also the home of Georgetown University, oldest and\r\nlargest Catholic school in the country. The broad acres of its\r\nbeautiful campus were undoubtedly originally responsible for\r\npreserving the historic buildings of the community from the onward rush\r\nof modernity which swept over the rest of Washington.\r\n\r\nBut also in Georgetown is the Hideaway Club. It is known in local\r\nparlance as a bottle club. A bottle club is a resort which gets around\r\nthe law which provides that all liquor dispensaries shall close at\r\n2 A.M. Despite a murder at the Hideaway and a recent Congressional\r\ninvestigation of such enterprises and a flurry of activity by the\r\nUnited States Attorney, there are still at least 500 of these\r\nunlicensed places, some say more, in the District, a subject which will\r\nbe covered in detail hereinafter.\r\n\r\nThe area’s favorite gathering place is Martin’s Bar on Wisconsin Avenue\r\nwhere New Deal and Fair Deal policy is made. It was the hangout of\r\nTommy the Cork and Harry Hopkins, who changed the world over bottles\r\nwhile Georgetown students roistered around them.\r\n\r\nGeorgetown is relatively free of street-walkers who plague every other\r\nsection. That is because there are no hotels and few transients.\r\nBut what it lacks in ambulent magdalens is more than made up for by\r\nhomosexuals of both indeterminate sexes. It seems that nonconformity\r\nin politics is often the handmaiden of the same proclivities in sex.\r\nAmong the thousands known in the capital, a goodly proportion live in\r\nthe storied ancient dwellings of the area. The fun that goes on in some\r\nis beyond words and was even worse when the staffs of the embassies of\r\nsome of the Iron Curtain countries still found it feasible to travel\r\nabout in society.\r\n\r\nSome Washington policemen will tell you with a shrug of despair of the\r\ntimes the patrol wagons pulled up at particular homes as a result of\r\ncomplaints from neighbors, only to find the prancing participants in\r\nthe unspeakable parties were Administration untouchables or diplomats\r\nsacred from interference.\r\n\r\nWhich, when you consider that Emmitt Warring also seems to be immune,\r\nmakes Georgetown seem like a wonderful place to live in--nobody ever\r\ngets pinched there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. NW COULD MEAN NOWHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first question asked by members of the new Seventh Congress, after\r\ntaking the oath in the draughty and unfinished Capitol in 1801, was\r\n“where is a saloon with dames?” or the early 19th century equivalent\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nThe chief usher escorted them to the steps on the Hill, which\r\noverlooked what there then was of the young city, a collection of\r\nboxes resembling nothing so much as a rude Oklahoma oil-boom town on a\r\nrainy day, and pointed northwest. “There,” he replied. Ever since that\r\nhistoric moment, anything that matters and much that doesn’t is in that\r\npart of the city known by its postal address as “NW.”\r\n\r\n“North West” is the only section of Washington which counts. It is the\r\ncapital of the capital. NW is the works.\r\n\r\nWhen Major Pierre L’Enfant accepted the commission to plan the capital,\r\nhe went Caesar’s Gaul one better and divided it into four parts. These\r\nhe laid out like spokes around a wheel, with the hub “The Hill,” on\r\nwhich he built the Capitol. He named each section after compounded\r\ncardinal points of the compass, NW, SW, NE and SE. The others you can\r\nthrow into the garbage-can--NW is the city.\r\n\r\nOther municipalities have distinctive sectors. In Washington\r\neverything, the rialto, marts of commerce, homes of the wealthy, are\r\npiled into this one corner, where they rub shoulders with the lowly,\r\nthe dirty and the wicked, not to overlook Washington’s No. 1 problem,\r\nthe colored.\r\n\r\nWashington’s Main Drag is F St. if you could call it such. The crossing\r\nat 14th Street is its Times Square, its State and Madison--an insult to\r\nboth. Most of the 1,500,000 who live in the District and environs, plus\r\na half-million tourists, pass it daily.\r\n\r\nHere are the movie palaces, but its sole legit theatre is almost a mile\r\naway. Its best-known restaurants are around the corner. Any night,\r\nSaturday included, the heart of America’s heart is dark and quiet.\r\n\r\nWashington’s Main Stem is somewhat more somnolent than those of most\r\nvillages. Don’t get us wrong--things do happen after dark. But--those\r\nwho do them don’t want them seen.\r\n\r\nWhen one seeks the reason for the empty dreariness of Washington at\r\nnight, where trees swaying in the wind often are the only living\r\nthings, he is told what seems the obvious--Washington is a town of\r\nearly-to-bedders who do not go in for night life. That is not true.\r\nWashington has hundreds of sneak-ins that remain open all night. Your\r\nhardy reporters almost collapsed before they could complete this\r\nassignment--to visit every place openly or surreptitiously breaking the\r\nlaw. Almost all are in NW, which should have made it easier.\r\n\r\nAfter-dark Washington is the way it is because it has the smalltown\r\nmentality. People do their sinning in homes and hotels or in\r\npseudo-private “clubs.”\r\n\r\nNow let’s get on with NW.\r\n\r\nMost Congressmen live there. That’s a break for all except cab-drivers.\r\nHack rates are regulated by zones. Passengers pay the same fee\r\nregardless of where they ride to in a zone, with a surcharge for each\r\nextra zone the cab enters. The Congressmen, who make all the District’s\r\nlaws, talked the Public Utilities Commission into gerrymandering the\r\nzone map in such a way it ended up allowing them and you and us to go\r\nalmost anywhere from the Capitol into NW for a minimum fee. No one\r\nwants to go elsewhere, so it’s a fine deal for all but the cab-jockies.\r\n\r\nAll the big hotels are in NW. That includes everything from\r\npopular-priced tourist fall-ins near the station to the luxury\r\nhostelries like the Mayflower, Statler, Carlton and the residential\r\nones in the outskirts, such as the Shoreham and Wardman Park. And the\r\nassignation hotels are downtown, smack in the middle of everything,\r\nvery snug.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most famous hotel is the Willard, at F and 14th Streets.\r\nThey call it the New Willard now, though the new section was built\r\nduring Teddy Roosevelt’s first administration. For almost a century,\r\nVIP’s from all over the world stayed here. Julia Ward Howe wrote the\r\n“Battle Hymn of the Republic” in one of its rooms. Now its cocktail bar\r\nis a hangout for lonesome government girls and other fancy-free women,\r\nbest time after 5 P.M.\r\n\r\nThe new and modern Ambassador Hotel is at 14th and K, one of the many\r\nholdings of Morris Cafritz, husband of Washington’s “first” hostess\r\nsince the elevation to the Diplomatic Corps of Mme. Mesta. The High\r\nHat Cocktail Lounge in the Ambassador is a gay drinking spot, much\r\npatronized by the lonesome of either sex because of its informality.\r\nWhen we asked a cab-driver where we could meet a “friend” he directed\r\nus to the Ambassador. We sat there five minutes, not long enough to\r\nattract a waiter’s eye. But the eyes of two blonde things, young and\r\nnot bad-looking, were quicker. One asked us to buy her a drink. We did.\r\n\r\nBefore long we were old friends. They told us they’d spend the evening\r\nwith us for $20 each. We said we had to catch a train. They thought we\r\nmeant the price was too high and reduced it to $10--“if we had a place\r\nto take them.”\r\n\r\nWe returned to the Ambassador half a dozen times, and all except once\r\nwe were approached. That time it was too late, about 1 A.M., and all\r\nthe volunteers had already booked themselves. We also saw other stags\r\ntalk to girls with whom they hadn’t come in, but with whom they left.\r\n\r\nAnother cash-and-carry supermarket is the gracious old Peacock Alley of\r\nthe Willard Hotel, a broad indoor parade where once world statesmen sat\r\nand sized up famed society beauties.\r\n\r\nThese hotels are not unique. All of Washington’s respectable inns and\r\ncocktail bars are plagued with loose ladies; there’s nothing much can\r\nbe done about it, because the muddled situation of District law and\r\nlaw enforcement makes it impossible for the managements to bounce that\r\nsort of undesirables--if they are so regarded. The cops would refuse to\r\neject them for fear of suits; the hotels and saloon-keepers are subject\r\nto the same liability. We saw hookers, or busy beavers that looked\r\nremarkably like them, speak to strangers in the cocktail lounges of the\r\nStatler and Carlton, and we were approached by one in the former place.\r\n\r\nThe hotel situation is never static. Comes war or emergency and the\r\ntown is always short on rooms. In times of depression or recession\r\nthere are too many rooms. When your authors began their regular trips\r\nto the city in search of material for this book, Washington had not\r\nstarted to take on its Sino-Korean war dress. We and our money were\r\nwelcomed with open arms. We spent lavishly throughout the summer at the\r\nCarlton, a haunt of New Deal and Labor aristocracy, where John L. Lewis\r\nand White House assistant David K. Niles maintain luxurious suites.\r\n\r\nAs the summer wore on, Washington filled up with hoards of\r\nbusinessmen, manufacturers’ agents, lawyers, fixers and other\r\nfinaglers. They had unlimited expense accounts. Remembering what\r\nhappened in Washington during the years of World War II, some leased\r\npermanent suites. Others slipped large and welcome tips to room clerks\r\nand executives. Then reservations at the Carlton for mere confidential\r\nreporters were bitched up. They were unceremoniously moved from room to\r\nroom, given second-class accommodations, notified they must get out; so\r\nbetter spenders could get in--and our bills had been running to $100 a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe Shoreham asked permanent guests to leave. Included were many\r\nCongressmen who had been living there for years. Some had voted against\r\nrent control in the District. But now they were Displaced Persons.\r\n\r\nIt was no secret that among the permanents who were in danger of being\r\nforced to go house-hunting were several statuesque blondes whose rents\r\nwere being paid by high officials, diplomats and senators. The swank\r\nShoreham, one of the most beautiful hotels anywhere, has figured\r\nprominently in police court and divorce court news more than once.\r\n\r\nWashingtonians smile when they wonder if the Shoreham’s managing\r\ndirector, Harry Bralove, asked his pretty ex-wife to find other\r\nlodgings, too. There was a lot of gossip when she and Bralove were\r\ndivorced. Once, when unable to meet an overdue $900 alimony bill,\r\nhe convinced the court he no longer had an interest in the hotel,\r\nmerely worked for it. Meanwhile he and his former spouse renewed their\r\nsentiments, but figured they’d be happier as friends than as man and\r\nwife. So the former Mrs. Bralove moved into the Shoreham.\r\n\r\nA very pleasant exception to the general rule about kicking the guests\r\naround is the Mayflower Hotel, after three decades, still the choice of\r\nWashington’s smart set. In the wing devoted to private apartments are\r\nhoused some of the most prominent people in the nation and they haven’t\r\nbeen moved to enable the management to snag profiteer revenue.\r\n\r\nWhat there is of show business is in NW. That is little. Yet it was\r\nnot always so. In the early days Washington was a hell of a show town.\r\nThere was gaiety then. Long before the streets were paved, dignitaries\r\nattended the theatres and dined sumptuously at famed eating spots.\r\n\r\nThe theatre figures prominently in Washington’s history. The martyred\r\nLincoln was slain in Ford’s Theatre, now a museum. President Wilson\r\nwas an incurable vaudeville fan with the real habit, attending the\r\nsame theatre every week on the same night. He used to slip out of the\r\nWhite House to Keith’s, a block away, where the management held a seat\r\nin the back row, where he tried to be unobserved. Washington had top\r\nvaudeville before the demise of that medium. Today Keith’s is a grind\r\nmovie house. The only thing resembling variety is at Loew’s Capitol,\r\nwhere four or five modest acts are sandwiched in between runs of a\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nWashington’s sole remaining legit theatre was the National. Once\r\nWashington was a hot road show town. Many New York hits-to-be had\r\ntheir tryouts there. Successes played week stands after leaving\r\nBroadway. Washington had minor population but supported many houses.\r\nIts residents were avid show-goers. The National gave up the ghost and\r\nturned into a movie house because of the race problem. Few Washington\r\ntheatres permit colored patronage, though Negro theatres allow whites.\r\n\r\nThe National was restricted against colored attendance in its lease.\r\nA couple of years ago, a race-conscious Actor’s Equity Association,\r\nsteamed up by Eleanor Roosevelt and her “we’re-all-brothers” group\r\nresolved not to permit its members to appear in any theatre in\r\nWashington while racial discrimination was enforced. Equity did not\r\nissue the same edict against theatres in the rest of the South, all\r\nof which are so restricted. The operators of the National were bound\r\nby the terms of their lease and could not change their policy. Rather\r\nthan risk a long, costly fight, they converted the house into a cinema.\r\nMeanwhile, for two years, the capital of the world’s most literate\r\nnation was barren of all living drama.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few months, the owners of the Gayety Burlesque, on\r\n9th Street, which is Washington’s Skid Row, converted it into a legit\r\nhouse. The Gayety had offered pretty low entertainment, because\r\npractically anything is permitted. But trade wasn’t too good. The cagey\r\noperators, not hampered by contractual restrictions, switched. To\r\naccent the fact that they were going all out on this new line of race\r\ntolerance, they booked as their first attraction a show with a mixed\r\ncast, “The Barrier” starring Lawrence Tibbett and Muriel Rahn, who is a\r\nNegro. Its theme was miscegenation in the Deep South.\r\n\r\nThe opening in the old home of burlesque, surrounded by shooting\r\ngalleries, tattoo artists and cheap sex movies for “adults only,” was\r\nattended by the top layer of Washington New Deal and left-wing weepers\r\nand critics for the Negro press and the _Daily Worker_. The show was\r\npanned by the other reviewers. It closed prematurely, after five\r\ndays. Producer Michael Meyerberg said, “We shouldn’t have opened in\r\nWashington.”\r\n\r\nAfter that, the theatre limped along, sometimes lighted, sometimes\r\ndark. The Negroes showed no zeal to patronize it. The whites passed\r\nit up. Now the Theatre Guild is sending shows there, subsidized by\r\nhighbrow subscribers.\r\n\r\nMany who want to see good drama go to New York. There’s usually a\r\nBroadway hit playing in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer, attempts are made to present road shows of New York\r\ncompanies on The Water Barge, in the Potomac, and in some neighborhood\r\nplayhouses. Regardless of the success of some individual play,\r\nWashington can be written off as a theatre town.\r\n\r\nDespite all the hardships, there are always optimists, especially when\r\nthey can get their names in the papers. One of these is Congressman\r\nKlein, of New York, a screaming New Dealer, who represents one of\r\nGotham’s most poverty-stricken neighborhoods. Klein is trying to get\r\nthe government to spend $5,000,000 for a national theatre. Naturally\r\nit is to be named the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial Theatre. Some of\r\nhis constituents need shoes, but F.D.R. needs another monument. His\r\nbill forbids barring any person from appearing in it or attending it\r\nbecause of race, creed, color, religion or national origin. It would\r\nbe conducted by the Secretary of the Interior, who at this writing is\r\nthat well-known showman, Oscar L. Chapman, of Denver, Colorado, who is\r\na co-founder of the Spanish-American League to Combat Exploitation of\r\nMexican Workers in the United States, an arty cause, no doubt.\r\n\r\nFor most of the area’s 1,500,000 permanents and 500,000 transients,\r\nmovies offer the big night out. How much longer, in the face of TV\r\ncompetition, remains to be seen. At the present time, attendance runs\r\n100,000 a day. Most film houses in white neighborhoods are restricted\r\nto whites. Negroes have their own. One of the most famous is the\r\nHoward, in the NW colored section, which often augments its shows with\r\ntop-flight Negro stage shows. At such times the place is apt to draw\r\nmore white customers than black. Washington has its hep-cats. Many of\r\nthe younger social and diplomatic sets get a bang out of hot licks.\r\nThese people who willingly sit next to dark folks in the Howard refuse\r\nto permit them in their own theatres or restaurants. That’s typical\r\nWashington thinking.\r\n\r\nThe high-class shopping street--the Fifth Avenue--is Connecticut\r\nAvenue, running from La Fayette Square, past the Mayflower Hotel,\r\nand out into Cleveland Parkway, past residential hotels and swank\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of first-grade shops here, with chic imports,\r\nexpensive antiques and other gewgaws to lure the feminine dollar.\r\nDespite the great wealth of the District and the presence of an\r\ninternational set, all is not pheasant for these merchants. New\r\nYork and the magnet of its style-conscious stores is too near. Even\r\nBaltimore gets some of the trade which can’t find enough smart things\r\nat home. But a curious reverse process has been taking place in recent\r\nyears. Whereas many Washingtonians travel to New York to shop and\r\nto dine, a couple of Washington’s best-known institutions have been\r\nreaching out and taking over some of the same places in New York which\r\nWashingtonians travel 225 miles to patronize.\r\n\r\nGarfinckel’s is Washington’s high-fashion department store. A couple of\r\nyears ago, its proprietors bought out the ancient and aristocratic New\r\nYork men’s furnishing house, Brooks Brothers. Within a few months, the\r\nGarfinckel octopus reached out and gobbled up one of New York’s oldest\r\nand best-known Fifth Avenue stores, de Pinna.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, a couple of smart Swedes, who had made a\r\ntremendous success at Olmsted’s Restaurant, a popular eatery with fine\r\nfood in the NW business section, bought New York’s oldest and most\r\nfamous restaurant, Luchow’s, on 14th Street, one of the last places\r\nleft in the country where dining is still a fine art.\r\n\r\nReference to the appendix will show many other Washington eating\r\nplaces, some good, some bad and not all recommended, but most of them\r\nare in NW.\r\n\r\nOne of the best-known and best is Harvey’s, on Connecticut Avenue, near\r\nthe Mayflower. This is J. Edgar Hoover’s nightly eating place when he\r\nis in Washington. Like most Washington restaurants, Harvey’s has been\r\nin business long. It specializes in sea food. The room does a sell-out\r\nbusiness and it’s almost impossible to get a table at the height of the\r\ndining hour. Service by ancient Negro waiters is slow. Best time to\r\neat is after 9, because most Washingtonians dine early; 6 o’clock is\r\nthe standard time. Many start at 5. Those are the homely habits. Some\r\nrestaurants close at 8, and a few at 7.\r\n\r\nJulius Lully, who owns Harvey’s, is the butt of J. Edgar’s robust sense\r\nof humor. Once Hoover had a batch of wanted-fugitive-identification\r\n“fliers” made up showing Lully in his World War I private’s uniform.\r\nHe had them nailed up on posts for miles around Lully’s country place.\r\nWhen the hick sheriff locked up the restaurateur, who sputtered and\r\ngave Hoover as a reference, J. Edgar said he had never heard of him.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Hoover sent a letter, purporting to be from Oscar\r\nof the Waldorf, threatening to sue Harvey’s for appropriating his\r\nsalad dressing. Lully hired a lawyer and told him to offer the Waldorf\r\n$2,500, but J. Edgar advised him it wouldn’t be enough.\r\n\r\nThe Occidental is hoary with age and legend. Pictures of presidents,\r\ncabinet officers and generals cover the walls. This was our favorite,\r\nbut the Occidental has succumbed to the new boom. An officious head\r\nwaiter, with a typical Prussian attitude toward customers, lined us up\r\nlike prisoners of war, then heaped contemptuous abuse when we dared\r\nquestion his excellency about the possible chances of being seated\r\nand served. Washingtonians take it. They are used to being kicked\r\naround. Senators or cabinet officers they may be, but at heart most are\r\ngrass-rooters overawed by the big city. We didn’t take it. We walked\r\nout. We are used to consideration and hospitality, spoiled by the good\r\nmanners of heartless Manhattan.\r\n\r\nWhen Major L’Enfant plotted the city, he provided that the streets\r\nshould run in three directions, north and south, east and west, and\r\ndiagonal. Where the diagonal avenues, which are named after states,\r\ncross the rectangular streets, generally numbered or alphabetically\r\nlettered, there are wide circles or broad squares. One of those is\r\nLafayette Park, known to all Americans because it is the square in\r\nfront of the White House. Here, less than a hundred yards from the\r\nPresident’s front door, is one of the most sordid spots in the world.\r\nAt night, under the heroic equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson and in\r\nthe shadow of the foliage of overhanging trees, there is a constant and\r\ncontinuous soprano symphony of homosexual twittering.\r\n\r\nThe President knows about it; he reads the papers. The police\r\nsuperintendent knows about it. Congress, which governs the District,\r\nknows about it. Recently, the secretary of a Senator was arrested\r\nthere, charged with indescribable misbehavior. He was acquitted by a\r\njury. There are few convictions.\r\n\r\nLafayette Park is one of the showplaces of NW. Another is Thomas\r\nCircle. Years ago, the circle and all the streets leading into it\r\nwere lined with mansions. Now you can pull up in your car in front of\r\na newsdealer there, at any hour, day or night, and place a bet on a\r\nhorse, buy a deck of junk or get a girl--$10 asking price, $5 if you\r\nput up a struggle.\r\n\r\nAnother NW cynosure was Dupont Circle. It was social. There were the\r\nhomes of such as Princess Eleanor Patterson. Now they’ve been razed or\r\ncut up because of taxes, death benefits, estate distributions and the\r\nhigh cost of maintenance. Those that still stand have been turned into\r\nembassies, headquarters of national organizations, and rooming-houses\r\nin between. One triangular corner was torn down to make way for the\r\nDupont Plaza, a glassy and glossy apartment hotel, swell for lobbyists,\r\nflashy girls and 5-percenters. What happened to Dupont Circle hit all\r\nthe way out the length of 16th Street, which runs off from the White\r\nHouse, and Massachusetts Avenue. These two long, broad avenues run\r\nthrough all NW. They are the “Ambassadors’ Rows.”\r\n\r\nOf the sixty embassies, legations and chancelleries, almost all are\r\non one or the other. Both have a liberal sprinkling of organization\r\nheadquarters, such as unions, trade associations and eleemosynary\r\ninstitutions, with the ever-present furnished-room coops and apartment\r\nhotels.\r\n\r\nThe complexion of NW is changing, growing darker. The area always had\r\na large Negro section. There are no racial zoning laws. Restrictive\r\ncovenants cannot be enforced. There are no longer any racial boundary\r\nlines and some people think that is dandy. They have been in the\r\ndriver’s seat since 1933.\r\n\r\nYou will find colored people living within a half a block of an embassy\r\nor around the corner from a new luxury apartment house. There is no\r\nreason why this should not be so, but the property-owners and the white\r\nresidents do not agree. As the process continues, NW grows less swank\r\nand less desirable, while many of its rich residents move into Maryland\r\nsuburbs such as Chevy Chase and across the river into Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes and other specific phenomena of NW will be considered in\r\nspecialized chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. NOT-SO-TENDER TENDERLOIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe District’s “red-light” region may be the largest on earth. That is\r\nbecause almost all of it is such, neither restricted by law, custom nor\r\nlocal habit to a particular part of town. But, more than any other, NW\r\nis the Tenderloin, in some ways more blatantly open than ever was New\r\nYork’s infamous Satan’s Circus or Chicago’s 22nd Street.\r\n\r\nOf all places, you would think Washington would be the last location a\r\npractical, professional prostitute would pick to pitch her camp. With\r\nso many more women than men, so many dames lonesome and far from home,\r\non the eager upbeat for a meal, a drink or even a kind word, you’d\r\nfigure mathematically, psychologically and pathologically that this\r\nwould be a ghost town for the trollops.\r\n\r\nPart of such traffic is always supported by tourists and strays.\r\nWashington has a large and constant visitation of these, but many\r\nother places have more and have virtually expunged street-walkers and\r\nentirely eradicated the sweatshops where such operators do homework.\r\nYet in Washington they flourish, though they are supposedly verboten,\r\nand the Weary Winnies parade the pavements. It made a couple of graying\r\nChicago boys homesick for their childhood.\r\n\r\nLorelles--as the Parisians call them--are in the Washington tradition,\r\nclaim the capital by long-established squatters’ rights, almost by\r\nright of discovery.\r\n\r\nThe same stagecoaches which carried the first Congressmen to Washington\r\n150 years ago brought also the first whores. They and their descendants\r\nhave been here ever since, an integral, important segment of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nFor the first 113 years they were protected by law. Segregation in the\r\nDistrict was expunged by act of Congress in 1913, in the first year of\r\nthe presidency of the school-teacher from Princeton.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Republic, whoring flourished as an essential\r\nand honorable trade. Transportation facilities were so primitive,\r\nmany Congressmen and officials from backwoods sections had trouble\r\ngetting to Washington themselves and would have found it impossible\r\nto transport their women. Trollops became an adjunct to legislation.\r\nWithout them, it is doubtful whether a quorum could have been\r\nmaintained for transaction of public business, which might not have\r\nbeen a bad idea sometimes.\r\n\r\nThe last compound of the trade was in what is now the Federal Triangle,\r\nbetween Pennsylvania Avenue and the Mall, from 10th to 15th Streets.\r\nThe Willard Hotel, the Treasury and the White House are nearby--which\r\nmade it convenient for all concerned.\r\n\r\nIn the Civil War, General Joe Hooker’s division was encamped in\r\nWashington to protect the President. It was bivouacked in what later\r\nbecame the official restricted district. One story, accounting for\r\nthe term “hooker,” now worldwide, ascribes its origin to the habitat\r\nof local prostitutes, who gathered near the camp to pick up soldiers\r\nand remained after the soldiers left. When local blades went out for a\r\nnight of hell-raising they said, “Let’s go over to Hooker’s.”\r\n\r\nAnother version ascribes the origin of the word to the Hook, in\r\nBaltimore, the town’s sailor section, where tarts picked up sea-faring\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a determination by H. L. Mencken, we will remain\r\nneutral as to the competing claims of the two neighboring cities,\r\nexcept to say that the residents of either ought to know what they’re\r\ntalking about, because there are so many hookers in both.\r\n\r\nLeaving out all occasionals in Washington who do it for fun or because\r\nof temporary monetary embarrassment, and counting only pros--those\r\nwho have no other form of livelihood, some say there are at least ten\r\nthousand floozies actively in full-time business at this moment. We\r\nwere solicited by half that number.\r\n\r\nMost of these girls work as loners on the streets or in the cocktail\r\nlounges and bring their earnings back to their pimps. Some function\r\nthrough call services, via a headquarters phone-number, a cocktail\r\nlounge bartender, or a switchboard operator in a cheap hotel.\r\n\r\nMany are tough and predatory. A 20-year old youth was stabbed and\r\nslashed after he turned down a street-corner proposition at Third and\r\nE. He fled when the woman drew a knife, but two colored men caught up\r\nto him and gave him the business.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, Washington was loaded with whore-houses, was in fact\r\nthe last large city where this ancient and storied institution existed.\r\n\r\nThat’s because it was necessary to take care of the transients and\r\nthe male government employes and officials away from their wives. The\r\nwar and the post-war housing shortage virtually put the final kibosh\r\non such dives here as it had done a few years earlier in other towns.\r\nProperty became so valuable, landlords could do better by running it\r\nlegitimately.\r\n\r\nWe spoke to a police captain who told us that obstacles were no longer\r\nplaced in the way of the vice squad when it came to raiding these\r\npremises; but it is impossible to keep the girls off the streets\r\nand out of the hotel lobbies and cocktail lounges where they had\r\ntransferred their business addresses.\r\n\r\nUnder the law of Washington, as well as all other municipalities,\r\nvice-squad detectives are forbidden to partake personally of forbidden\r\nwares while on raids. If they do, they have no case, for a prosecution\r\nthen becomes “entrapment” and they are agents provocateurs.\r\n\r\nDuring a recent raid, an operational plan was drawn up in advance. One\r\nof the cops, the handsomest, made the pick-up, and his confederates\r\nwere supposed to crash in five minutes after he entered the room, which\r\nwould give both time to disrobe, and that is enough evidence to make a\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\nBut the raiders were late. The honest, hardworking cop went through the\r\nmotions of undressing. Finally he had to get in bed with the wench; 15,\r\n20, 30 minutes passed, and still no raiding party. He couldn’t stall\r\nher off any more.\r\n\r\nBy the time the doors were busted in, the evidence was null and void.\r\n\r\nThe figures in this chapter refer solely to white tarts. The black\r\nsisters are mentioned in another one.\r\n\r\nHealth records indicate that 50 percent of Washington’s white\r\nstreet-walkers are infected with venereal disease. With the colored\r\nones, it goes up to 99 percent.\r\n\r\nMany of the white women who solicit on the streets are young; it takes\r\nsome time for these girls, fresh off the farms, to get the nerve to\r\nhustle in high-class hotels. Police have arrested girls 14, 15 and 16\r\nhawking their bodies on the public highways. Many of these children,\r\nwho should be home doing their schoolwork, left the hills when they\r\nwere 12, after first having been raped by a local lout, usually a\r\nrelative.\r\n\r\nThis story is not apocryphal. A very young street-walker was formally\r\ncharged by the arresting officer with “practicing prostitution.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not so, your honor,” she piped up. “I don’t practice any more.\r\nI know how now.”\r\n\r\nThe going rate for whores, the pick-up kind, is $20 and down. Pretty\r\nfair ones will take $10, and many will come along for $5. These prices\r\nare low compared with the current tariffs in other large cities, the\r\nreason being the extraordinary amateur competition.\r\n\r\nMany of the girls roll their customers, mugg them or use knockout\r\ndrops and then go through their pockets. But Washington’s prostitutes\r\nare not so hard-hearted as the street sirens in New York, where it is\r\ncommonplace for one to be taken to a hotel-room and wake up doped and\r\nrobbed, but never loved.\r\n\r\nMany Washington nymphs conscientiously give value received.\r\n\r\nIn other cities the cops take stern measures against the untrustworthy\r\nwhores. It is considered the lowest form of larceny to take advantage\r\nof a man with his pants down. New York police recently sent a young\r\nmarried woman to the penitentiary for five years for just such an\r\noutrage, but in Washington the appointed judges, many unrealistic\r\nand some downright dishonest, condone and encourage such unethical\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nDavid L. Miller, 43, a resident of the Soldiers’ Home, picked up\r\nAlma Lee Dugent and took her to a 16th Street, NW, room. He said the\r\n33-year-old woman robbed him of $2 in bills and a $30 wrist watch while\r\nhe lay asleep. The woman pleaded guilty of petty theft.\r\n\r\n“This man is as guilty as the woman,” thundered the judge. He ordered\r\nMiller to pay half of Mrs. Dugent’s $25 fine.\r\n\r\nAt this writing there are few really big madames operating in\r\nWashington. One of the last big operators was Carmen Beach, deported to\r\nSpain. But Nancy Pressler, who figured prominently in the conviction\r\nof Charles “Lucky” Luciano, international Mafia overlord now in Italy,\r\nwhen she turned state’s evidence against him in New York, is in\r\nbusiness in the capital.\r\n\r\nThough many of the girls work as independent contractors, except for\r\nthe inevitable pimp, they are loosely organized for emergency purposes\r\nin the event of arrest, through bail-bond brokers and lawyers who\r\nspecialize in underworld cases. The law staff of Charles Ford is\r\nfrequently in court defending intercepted prostitutes, who usually get\r\noff with a small fine or a warning.\r\n\r\nMany singed doves get their weekly check-ups from a physician in the\r\n1700 block of K Street, who charges them $5 a visit. They learn about\r\nhim through their community of interests.\r\n\r\nWe have studied commercial vice in most large cities. It is as a\r\nrule confined by public tolerance to certain streets or sections.\r\nWhen we wrote about New York and Chicago we were able to name these\r\nthoroughfares and state exactly what kind of merchandise was for sale\r\nin each. That is not so in Washington, where the city seems to be one\r\nhuge red-light range, with tramps falling over themselves trying to\r\ngrab unattached men.\r\n\r\nWe made a contact on the southeast corner of 14th and New York Avenue,\r\nNW, in front of the cigar store, with a young pedestrian who told\r\nus her name was Sue. She came originally from Florida and had been\r\nhustling in Washington for four years. We asked how to get in touch\r\nwith her again and she said, “Just call the Astoria Hotel and ask the\r\noperator for Sue.” When we inquired her last name she said she was the\r\nonly Sue there. The Astoria is a cheap hotel on 14th Street.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks later we were walking through the plush lobby of the\r\nnew Statler Hotel and saw Sue ensconced in one of the comfortable\r\narmchairs. We stopped to watch. The slender blonde leaned over to a\r\ngent in another chair and asked for a light. In a couple of minutes\r\nthey struck up a deal and walked into the elevator together. When she\r\ncame down half an hour later we asked her how much she got.\r\n\r\n“Ten bucks,” she exclaimed, “and the tight-wad stiffed me out of luck\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\nWhen we first came to Washington to work on this book almost everyone\r\nwe spoke to, except cops who knew better, said we wouldn’t find any\r\nprofessional whores, because why should anyone pay when so many\r\ngovernment girls are easy?\r\n\r\nWe took some of these friends--government officials, members of\r\nCongress, newspapermen and others, on our tours. And this is what we\r\nshowed them:\r\n\r\nWe were solicited by two girls at Jack’s Grill, 3rd and G Sts. Three\r\nbroads came up to us at 4th and G NW and asked us if we wanted company.\r\nWe also saw girls bracing strange men at the Purity Lunch and Grill,\r\n3rd and G NW, and at Mitchell Grill on the same corner. Mitchell’s is\r\nthe hangout for precinct cops who saved its license after charges.\r\n\r\nA white prostitute tried to date us at the Mai Fong restaurant, in\r\nChinatown, and two other girls spoke to us at the China Clipper on 14th.\r\n\r\nWe could have made pick-ups--$10 asked, $5 bid--at the corner of 14th\r\nand R. We were approached by girls at the Casablanca Tavern, 421 11th\r\nSt., NW, and the Covered Wagon, 14th and Rhode Island. The manager\r\nof an all-night diner back of the Statler offered to get us a bed\r\ncompanion for $15 if we bought a bottle of Seagrams for $8.50--cheap\r\nwhen you consider it was after hours and he didn’t have a license.\r\n\r\nFew if any restaurants and bars employ B-girls. These are women who in\r\nChicago circulate from table to table and hustle drinks on commission.\r\nThey are illegal in the District, though quite common in Maryland, near\r\nthe border and in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThe femmes fatale who frequent Washington joints usually do so in\r\nfree-handed reciprocity. The management steers lonesome men to the gals\r\nwho hang around regularly. They, in turn, bring their customers in for\r\ndrinks or tell them that’s where they can find them. A saloon which\r\ngets a reputation as the hangout for the best-looking dames finds its\r\ngross up.\r\n\r\nWhen a girl closes a pitch, she usually has a place to take the guy,\r\nif he can’t or won’t bring her to his own room. Most Washington\r\nhotels, including the largest, are very broadminded about this, and if\r\nyou don’t make noise they don’t make trouble. But this situation is\r\nchanging as the hotels are getting more crowded and more independent.\r\n\r\nFew small hotels, even if so inclined, properly police their guests.\r\nSome of the girls take their clients to the New Colonial and the Fox.\r\n\r\nA former madame named Jackie is now running a rooming-house at 703 Mt.\r\nVernon, where some of the girls steer their customers. You can usually\r\nfind seven or eight girls hanging around Ivy House Inn, on New York\r\nAvenue.\r\n\r\nAmong the most active hookers are Kay Saunders and Peggy Proctor, both\r\n29, who were once arrested while entertaining 15 male customers. At\r\nthis writing they are still in business on the second floor of a house\r\nin the 2300 block, Lincoln Road, NE.\r\n\r\nOne of Washington’s most famous characters is a toothless old hag known\r\nonly as Diane. She hangs around 14th and Florida. Diane reminds old New\r\nYorkers of the fabulous Broadway Rose, who used to panhandle in front\r\nof Lindy’s until she was carted to the bug house.\r\n\r\nBut, unlike Rose, Diane is an out-and-out hustler. Once upon a time,\r\nthey say, she was a good-looker. But her main trouble seemed to be that\r\nshe liked her work too much to commercialize it.\r\n\r\nWe spoke to a man in his late 30’s who remembered her when he was a\r\nschool boy. He said the kids used to pick her up because she would take\r\n“small change.” Now some of her old customers, matured and prosperous\r\nmen of the world, occasionally drive by her corner to stake her to a\r\nhand-out.\r\n\r\nAll she can get now are colored men, “winos” and dregs. But she refuses\r\nto retire.\r\n\r\nWe picked up a girl by the name of Doris who had just been discharged\r\nfrom the Federal Hospital for narcotic addicts in Lexington, Kentucky.\r\nThe story she told us illustrates how girls are recruited for\r\nprostitution in the District.\r\n\r\nDoris said she lived in a small town in West Virginia. She and a girl\r\nhigh-school mate occasionally did a little free-lance whoring on\r\nSaturday nights, on call of a bell-boy in the local hotel. Once he sent\r\nthem to a room occupied by two men. One, whose name was Grigsby, tried\r\nto sell the girls on coming to Washington. He said he’d put them in a\r\nswell house. The teenagers were afraid of the big city. Grigsby told\r\nthem the landlady of the house was in the next room and called her in.\r\nShe was a motherly sort. They consented to come with her.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves in the house of a madame named Billie Cooper,\r\non 7th St., in the 1000 block. Doris told us she was an instantaneous\r\nsuccess in the Cooper menage. She was only 17, fresh, buxom and\r\nbucolic. Madame Cooper’s clients were charmed. After she’d been in\r\nthe house a few weeks, the madame asked Doris if she’d like to get a\r\n“kick.” She produced a hypodermic needle and gave the child a shot\r\nin the arm. Doris liked the sensation, wanted more. This went on for\r\nseveral weeks, Doris said, and every day Billie Cooper increased the\r\nfrequency of the shots.\r\n\r\nOne day Doris woke up, nauseated and ill.\r\n\r\nBillie Cooper exclaimed, “You’re hooked!”\r\n\r\nShe informed Doris she had become a dope fiend, that henceforth Doris\r\nmust pay for the shots.\r\n\r\nThe girl went into debt, though she was taking in up to $50 a day and,\r\nno matter how much she made, the dope always cost more. She knew no\r\none else who sold it. She was truly hooked, which was Billie Cooper’s\r\noriginal purpose, to keep the young girl in her joint and take her\r\nmoney away from her.\r\n\r\nBillie Cooper’s clientele was mostly Chinese. When U. S. narcotics\r\nagents raided her establishment at 5 A.M., gaining entrance with a\r\nladder borrowed from a fire-house, so two T-men would get into Billie’s\r\nbedroom before she had a chance to flush the narcotics down the drain,\r\nthey found several Chinese customers in the place. While the search was\r\nstill on, 15 more came to the door and were admitted; of these two were\r\nofficials of the Chinese embassy.\r\n\r\nIn the trial it developed that Billie Cooper, who was sentenced for\r\nviolation of the narcotics laws, was charging Doris $7 a deck for\r\nheroin, which she bought at half that price from Chinese peddlers. The\r\nF.B.I. proceeded against Grigsby for white slavery violation and he,\r\ntoo, was convicted.\r\n\r\nDoris swore to us that she was off the stuff now. She said she was\r\nliving with a Chinaman who worked in a gambling house in Chinatown.\r\n\r\nThe glamorous brothels are no more. Not since the notorious Hopkins\r\nInstitute was closed by the F.B.I. some years ago has there been\r\nanything operating on a lavish scale. Now there are some so-called\r\nmasseurs who use that classification as a blind, but nothing on the\r\ngrand scale.\r\n\r\nWhen F.B.I. men raided the Hopkins Institute, an innocuous-looking\r\nmassage parlor in the 2700 block on Connecticut Ave., they uncovered\r\none of the most sensational call-houses ever in Washington. Not only\r\nwas the clientele accommodated at the so-called Institute, but a phone\r\ncall could arrange a date on short notice almost anywhere in the\r\nDistrict. The establishment kept a detailed and up-to-date written\r\nrecord on each patron, fees paid, dates of service, and eccentricities.\r\nGirls there said this list contained entries that could flabbergast\r\nsome very prominent persons, in and out of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of the Hopkins Institute was one George Francis\r\nWhitehead, who lived in New York and seldom visited the place. Profits\r\nwere sent to him weekly by the “resident manager,” Diane Carter, who\r\nwas vice-president in charge of the operation. The Institute was\r\nestablished originally by someone else and was bought by Whitehead\r\nin 1941. He ran it for several months, then engaged Diane Carter to\r\nmanage it at a salary out of earnings. Her principal duties entailed\r\naccepting calls, arranging to send girls to answer the calls, and to\r\nhave girls available on the premises.\r\n\r\nWhitehead left Washington in 1941, after the girls began to complain\r\nthat his presence was hurting business because of his excessive\r\ndrinking, untidy habits and uncouth deportment. He did not live up to\r\nthe dignity and spirit of an Institute. The girls threatened to strike.\r\n\r\nThe record system was originated by the first operator and passed on to\r\nWhitehead. In addition to other entries, initials of each girl filling\r\nan assignment and the amount of the fee were noted. For the fees a code\r\nwas used, to conceal the fact that some paid more than others. The word\r\n“FITZGERALD” was the key to the code. Each letter stood for a digit,\r\ni.e., F was 1, I was 2, T was 3, etc. Thus the symbol “FD” beside the\r\nname of a customer meant $10; “TD” meant $30, etc. This method was used\r\nalso to bamboozle Whitehead, if he checked on his share of the proceeds.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Commissioner issued warrants for the arrests of Whitehead,\r\nDiane Carter and 13 girls involved, on charges of violations of the\r\nWhite Slave Traffic Act. Whitehead was arrested in New York and\r\nextradited. Two indictments were returned against Whitehead, Diane and\r\nnine others. Whitehead pleaded guilty to both and was sentenced to one\r\nto four years on the Act and to eighteen months on conspiracy. But he\r\nwas adjudged insane and committed to a mental institution.\r\n\r\nDiane Carter pleaded guilty to both indictments and was sentenced to\r\nthree to nine months on each, the sentences to run concurrently. Seven\r\nother defendants were found guilty.\r\n\r\nThe Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the convictions of the seven,\r\nheld the violations were of legislation of the District of Columbia and\r\nnot of the White Slave Traffic Act.\r\n\r\nBut the racket was broken. The place never reopened. The F.B.I. seized\r\nthe files and never revealed a name, but hundreds of men still tremble\r\nwhen they remember the Hopkins Institute. Some still attempt pressure\r\nto try to get their names blacked out. They have no success with the\r\nF.B.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. HOBOES WITH NO HORIZON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pride of the bum, even when he has abandoned the virile vitality\r\nto hold out his paw as a panhandler, is a terminal twinkle of\r\nconsciousness that he is only resting between Election Days, when he is\r\na man. These derelicts have swung cities and states. But in Washington\r\neven that last link to a reason for being is lost.\r\n\r\nNo Hinky Dink, no Pendergast caters to him, gives him free beer\r\nand rot-gut or a kip in the flop on the joint. No eager dirty duke\r\nstretches forth to greet the floater and the repeater. He can do\r\nnothing for anyone.\r\n\r\nSo he is just a shade lower, lousier and grizzlier than the ones at\r\nwhom you shudder as you pass them in your own town. Agglomerations of\r\nbeachcombers vary little, even with differences of climate. Every city\r\nhas its Skid Row. But Washington has three of them. Like everything\r\nelse here, they are departmentalized. No alphabetical designations have\r\nyet been allocated to them, but don’t despair.\r\n\r\nOne is for the general riffraff; the second is for old-timers; the\r\nthird is exclusively for sailors.\r\n\r\nBut first let us tell you about 9th Street--NW, natch--and specifically\r\nwhere it crosses Pennsylvania Ave.\r\n\r\nStand on one side of the avenue and you are in the shadow of the great\r\nmarble structure which houses the forces of law and order. This is the\r\nDepartment of Justice Building, and the corner we’re standing on is the\r\nentrance to the F.B.I.\r\n\r\nCross Pennsylvania Avenue and walk into 9th Street, and you are an\r\nintruder in the most publicized Skid Row of the three--they call it the\r\nBowery here, to distinguish it from the others. As such thoroughfares\r\ngo, this is pretty classy-looking. It is wide. All Washington\r\nstreets are kept clean, so neither rubbish nor drunks litter the\r\npavements--anyway not by day. By nightfall, topers rendered hors de\r\ncombat on smoke and cheap wine pile up in the doorways.\r\n\r\nThis part of 9th Street is packed solid with “play lands,” featuring\r\npin-ball machines, peep show movies and souvenir stands which sell\r\ncomposition statuettes of the White House and Washington Monument, and\r\nembroidered pillows tastefully lettered with “Love to Mom from the\r\nNation’s Capital.”\r\n\r\nBut this human dump lacks romance and legend. No songs are written\r\nabout it. There are no grisly tall tales, such as are told about the\r\nBarbary Coast, Basin Street and Chicago, much near the Loop and most of\r\nthe old Levee. This is merely a street of convenience, moved up from\r\naround the corner when Pennsylvania Avenue itself was flophouse lane\r\nand Al Jolson and Bill Robinson performed on the sidewalk for pennies.\r\n\r\nThere’s no law agin’ stripping or peeling in Washington, but it doesn’t\r\npay off well enough to build a permanent industry around it. The old\r\nGayety Theatre, which ran pretty high-class traveling burleycue, is\r\nnow, probably only temporarily, a legit house. Meanwhile, the burlesque\r\nfans buy their titillation in the cheap movie houses adjoining the\r\nGayety. Sometimes they amplify their celluloid bills with “living\r\ndolls,” at other times the customers have to get their kicks out of\r\nsex movies advertised “For Adults Only.” An ad before us, of the\r\nLeader Theatre, says, “Burlesque’s brightest stars on screen.” The\r\nday’s program provided snake-charming Zorita in “I Married a Savage”;\r\nbody-peeling Ann Corio in “Call of the Jungle”; and Maggie Hart, the\r\nstripper, in “Lure of the Isles,” plus “two more thrills.”\r\n\r\nIn and in front of cheap saloons, cocktail lounges and lunch rooms, are\r\ntarts, reefer-peddlers and novelty salesmen whose chief stock in trade\r\nis “sanitary rubber goods.” Pistols are on sale at $20. The local law\r\nisn’t tough on gun-toters.\r\n\r\nThough Washington’s legal liquor closing on weekdays is 2 A.M., this\r\nstreet, like all in the city, is deserted early. Long before midnight\r\nits habitués have already made sleeping arrangements or are snoring in\r\nthe alleys, cheap overnight lodgings or hallways, paralyzed by alky or\r\ncheap domestic red wine.\r\n\r\nCrossing 9th Street here, is D Street, known as Pawnbroker’s Row. But\r\nget this--hockshops are against the law.\r\n\r\nWhen you see a shop with a sign reading “Pawnbroker’s Exchange,” don’t\r\nbelieve it. The window looks like any “Uncle’s” anywhere in the world,\r\nwith a profusion of new and used articles ranging from mink coats\r\nto tin watches. But that’s the build-up. These exchanges are only\r\nsecond-hand stores which buy and sell uncalled for articles pledged in\r\nother jurisdictions, where the three balls of the De Medicis are legal.\r\n\r\nThe temporarily embarrassed visitor, in need of cash quickly, often\r\ngets rooked in one of these pseudo-hock shops. Take the case of the\r\nstranger who runs short of petty cash until he can wire home. Suppose\r\nhe has a $200 watch which he wants to put up for security. Needing only\r\nperhaps $25, that’s all he asks for, figuring when he redeems it in a\r\nfew days he will pay only that, plus accrued interest. Yet when he asks\r\nthe pawnbroker’s exchange man for $25, he is actually selling the $200\r\nwatch for that.\r\n\r\nSome of the more legitimate shops get around the law by guaranteeing\r\nto sell the article back to the owner at a specified rate after a\r\nspecified number of days. What usually happens to the unsophisticated\r\nis that they have lost their security for a fraction of its value,\r\nbecause it has already been sold.\r\n\r\nLittle effort is made to police the Bowery stretches of 9th St. The\r\narmed forces maintain a few MPs, but practically anything goes, short\r\nof mayhem, and even that is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe tomatoes who solicit the young and lonesome men in uniform in\r\nthis neighborhood are pretty low. The five bucks they ask, plus three\r\ndollars for a room in a handy flea-bag, should be reported to the\r\nBetter Business Bureau, considering the quality of the merchandise and\r\nthe strong possibilities of picking up souvenirs of the sort they don’t\r\ndisplay on counters.\r\n\r\nInterspersed between the shooting galleries, theatres and hamburger\r\nhideaways are the usual bargain men’s clothing stores, army and navy\r\noutfitters, etc. One of the clothing stores, visible from the windows\r\nof the Department of Justice, was built by money inherited from a\r\ngangster who isn’t around to enjoy it, due to a sit-down strike in an\r\nelectric chair.\r\n\r\nThis street is a little too fast, flighty and noisy for the old-time\r\nbums and stiffs. It is for younger men. The perennials, who know every\r\nflop-house and smoke-joint in the country, and travel from town to\r\ntown with the seasons and the harvests, prefer the Skid Row at 3rd and\r\nG Streets, NW and vicinity, around the corner from Chinatown. Come to\r\nthink of it, Skid Rows all over the continent are around the corner\r\nfrom Chinatown.\r\n\r\nWe call this Mission Row, because it’s where the mission stiffs hang\r\nout. These are the hoboes, bums and tramps who get their morning’s\r\ncoffee and their night’s sleep on the benches of a gospel shop nearby\r\non H Street, in return for listening to a “Come to the Lord” sermon.\r\nMission Row is the best-looking Skid Row in the country. The streets\r\nare broad, with grass and trees, and most of the set-back buildings are\r\nreconverted residences with stoops and a surviving air of charm. We\r\nhave been assured it is refreshing to wake up in the gutter here with a\r\nsmoke hangover.\r\n\r\nYou find no brassy newcomers in these quarters. Young tramps abhor\r\nmissions. They prefer 9th Street, with its zip and excitement. The\r\nmission stiff, almost an extinct species, is on in years and no\r\nlonger troubled by dames. His animal needs are taken care of by a\r\nbowl of soup and as much red-eye as he can drink. If only one of the\r\ntwo is available, the former can be dispensed with. Some of these\r\nmission-moochers are junkies. But dope, like everything else, is\r\nsuffering from inflation, and the wherewithal is forbidding.\r\n\r\nThe Greek colony, large for the size of the town, runs into this\r\nBowery. Many Hellenes are gamblers. Hecht’s Hotel, at 6th and G, where\r\ngirls take their men, was owned by a Greek arrested last month in New\r\nYork on narcotics charges. The Hellenic Social Club, next door, is a\r\ngambling house.\r\n\r\nThere’s one Skid Row no visitors and few Washingtonians ever see.\r\nThat’s Sailors’ Row. Unlike the other two, which are in NW, this is\r\nin SE--8th Street, down near the Navy Yard. After Chicago we thought\r\nnothing could make us blink. But some of the dives on 8th Street made\r\nit. At the northern approach of this stretch of howling hell are a\r\ncouple of Filipino joints where bus-boys, house-boys and valets pick up\r\nwhite whores. Eighth Street runs into Sailors’ Row proper, a line of\r\ngroggeries and lunch-rooms that hit bottom.\r\n\r\nThe undermanned Washington cops can do little to keep it orderly.\r\nThe Navy’s shore patrol takes over most of the policing. We saw Navy\r\npaddy-wagons in front of Guy’s, the Ship’s Cafe and the Penguin. But\r\nthe SP’s seldom make a pinch unless there are fights. We visited four\r\nor five of the bars--not alone, because hereabouts, even in the shadow\r\nof the Capitol’s dome, outsiders who travel in parties of less than\r\nfour are crazy.\r\n\r\nWe saw hustlers working in the Band Box, the Ship’s Cafe, Guy’s and\r\nthe Penguin. These were the frowsiest broads we have ever seen,\r\ndilapidated, toothless, drunk, swinging the shabby badge of their\r\nshoddy trade, long-looped handbags.\r\n\r\nThe worst and the cheapest were in the Ship’s Cafe, where two\r\ngirls--call them that in charity--offered themselves to us at $3. The\r\ngoing price in the other places was $5. They circulated along the\r\nbar and from booth to booth and from table to table. They do not work\r\nin these saloons as B girls or house prostitutes. They use them as\r\npoints of contact with their trade, apparently with connivance of the\r\nmanagement for the business they bring in. In these Sailors’ Row joints\r\nwe saw many amateurs, typical sailor-crazy bobby-soxers, servant girls\r\nand Victory girls. These may ask for money but can be talked out of it.\r\nThere are many cheap hotels and rooming-houses close by. But the dark\r\nstreets or alleys are free and busy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. GREEN PASTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nAgonized oratory through the decades has been banging against the walls\r\nof the Capitol, demanding that Washingtonians be given the precious\r\nprivilege of the vote. It is as futile as spitting against the wind.\r\n\r\nAnd we will tell you why there will be no vote--Confidential.\r\n\r\nIf Washington got home rule, its first mayor would be a gentleman\r\naffectionately known to his constituency as Puddin’ Head Jones. And Mr.\r\nJones is a Negro.\r\n\r\nWe will tell you what no one else has dared to publish--there are more\r\nNegroes than whites in Washington. We will prove it by incontrovertible\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nThere is an amazing underground proclivity in all big cities, south,\r\nnorth and everywhere, to fake the facts on Negro population. For some\r\ndistorted reason, both races conspire in this foolish flummery.\r\n\r\nCensus figures are off the beam. They always lag in summing up\r\nminority races. Most of the migrant census-takers assume that they\r\nshould help to make the picture as light as possible. If a Negro is\r\nnot unmistakably black, he is encouraged, if he does not think of it\r\nhimself, to be listed as a Cuban, a Puerto Rican, a West Indian, a\r\nSouth American, Filipino, Indian, Mexican or even Eskimo; the blood of\r\nall these is sprinkled through many generations of admixture.\r\n\r\nThere is no way of calculating how many light-skinned citizens can and\r\ndo “pass.” Some Negroes sleep in shifts in crowded premises, so that a\r\ncount in the regular course would register about one-third of the true\r\ntotal. Many are house servants and these do not go into the tally where\r\nthey are employed, nor are they home during the hours when enumerators\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nMore Negroes than whites are police characters, as will be\r\ndemonstrated. And as a rule members of the race are wary and suspicious\r\nof questioners from “the law.” Many census-takers deliberately duck\r\nmore than superficial duties in predominantly dark districts, because\r\nthey are confused and afraid after getting hostile receptions and\r\nresponses.\r\n\r\nBut in Washington there is one indisputable check.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia has a single Jim Crow law, segregating Negroes\r\nand whites--in schools. When pupils are enrolled they must reveal their\r\ntrue race. There can be no tampering with these statistics.\r\n\r\nAnd in the winter of 1950–51 there were registered the following in all\r\npublic schools through all grades from elementary to teachers’ college:\r\n\r\nNegroes, 47,807; whites, 46,080.\r\n\r\nBroken down, these figures are even more definitive. There are more\r\nNegroes than is evidenced by the bare totals. Negroes, because of their\r\neconomic outlook, do not keep their children in school as long as do\r\nwhites. That is sharply proven by the enrollment in the senior high\r\nschools:\r\n\r\nNegroes, 4,787; whites, 7,176.\r\n\r\nBut there are 10,146 colored children in junior high schools compared\r\nto 9,270 whites.\r\n\r\nThe attendance at parochial and private schools is minor. Washington\r\nhas the largest per capita Negro Catholic population in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nEven an excess of 10 per cent of whites in the grand total and allowing\r\nfor unmarried government workers would still indicate a Negro majority\r\nover all, because of the earlier departure from school of Negro\r\nchildren, as shown above.\r\n\r\nThis reveals a startling metamorphosis in a ten-year period. In 1940\r\nthe school record showed 66,000 whites and 36,000 Negroes. Thus there\r\nhas since been a decline of 20,000 white children and a rise of 12,000\r\nNegro children. The over-all decline is due to removal of white\r\nfamilies to suburbs.\r\n\r\nNegroes lived in Washington before the first President chose the\r\nrolling land along the Potomac to bear his name. Slavery was legal in\r\nthe capital until the emancipation. The population of Washington about\r\ndoubled between 1860 and 1870. Much of this influx represented slaves\r\nwho escaped from plantations and got through the Union lines during the\r\nCivil War. But the big swell came when thousands of ex-slaves, free\r\nand foot-loose for the first time in their lives, left the destroyed\r\nand deserted Dixie farms and headed for Washington, which was not only\r\nnear Virginia and Maryland and the Carolinas, but which exercised a\r\nfascination for them because they felt safer near their savior and\r\ntheir demigod, Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nUntil the middle 70’s, Washingtonians of all colors had home rule,\r\nelected their own officials under a territorial form of government\r\nsimilar to that now practiced in Alaska and Hawaii, where mayors,\r\nlegislators, judges and other lower-level officials are elected. They\r\nsent a delegate to Congress.\r\n\r\nLong before LaGuardia, Marcantonio, Ed Flynn and Ed Kelly found the\r\nformula of organizing Negroes into blocs which could be voted en masse\r\nto perpetuate control of left-wing and criminal political groups, that\r\nwas old stuff in D.C., where it was invented by one “Boss” Shepherd\r\nin Washington, the first large city in the country where Negroes were\r\nallowed to vote, and where there were enough of them to throw any\r\nweight as citizens.\r\n\r\nWashington had been a sewer of iniquity during the Civil War; when\r\nShepherd took over control it turned infinitely worse. The stench\r\nasphyxiated the members of Congress, who were exposed to it so\r\nintimately, and they exercised a forgotten constitutional prerogative,\r\n“to exclusively govern the District.” The polling booths made swell\r\nbonfires.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen, however, under the unique voteless system, the Negroes\r\nnow exercise far more power, and Puddin’ Head Jones is by common\r\nconsent the “mayor” of Washington’s Black Belt. As we progress you will\r\nbe let in on how that could come about.\r\n\r\nDespite the high enrollment of Negro children in public schools where\r\nthey enjoy facilities for education equal to white children, Negroes\r\ncontinue to have an illiteracy far above the full population. In 1942,\r\nilliteracy in the District was only 1 percent for all races, whereas\r\nthe Negro group showed 4 percent. Weighing these figures against the\r\nproportions of population in 1942 would seem to indicate that the\r\nNegroes were about 15 times as illiterate as whites.\r\n\r\nMuch later figures are available, however. Only 4 percent of\r\nWashington’s white youths who took the Army’s mental tests in 1950\r\nfailed, but nearly 29 percent of the prospective colored recruits were\r\nturned back.\r\n\r\nNew York’s Harlem is self-contained. Though Chicago’s Bronzeville has\r\ngone over its borders and set up tributary colonies in other sections\r\nof the city, it is still the center of Negro life there and contains\r\nmost of its colored population.\r\n\r\nBut Washington’s Black Belt is no belt at all. It is sprawled all over,\r\ninfiltrating every mile and almost every block in sections which for\r\n150 years were lily white.\r\n\r\nIn New York, when you refer to Harlem, everyone knows what part of town\r\nyou’re talking about. Similarly, Bronzeville and Central Avenue have\r\ndefinite meanings in Chicago and Los Angeles. In Washington, you have\r\nno way of indicating Darktown, because the Negro section has no generic\r\nname and it isn’t a section. It is all of Washington.\r\n\r\nWhat is occurring in Washington is happening on a lesser scale in large\r\nnorthern population centers, except probably Manhattan, where Harlem\r\nis geographically restrained by Columbia University and Central Park,\r\nthough Puerto Ricans are generously overflowing its borders on both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, instead of being bound in black ghettos, Negroes have\r\npreempted many sections, including former residences of millionaires.\r\nThey live along wide and vernal boulevards in once splendid apartments\r\nand luxurious private homes with greeneries, and in palaces of packers\r\nand pioneer pirates.\r\n\r\nThis process is being repeated in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Detroit\r\nand especially Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe South, with its restrictive practices against Negroes and its\r\nunderpayment of them, is gradually being denuded of its cheap labor,\r\nwhich is drawn North.\r\n\r\nThe recent census showed the population of most metropolitan cities\r\nremained stable. But their suburbs, beyond city limits, increased in\r\nmany from 50 to 100 percent or more. This growth of Suburbia was made\r\nby whites who left as Negroes came. That kept city populations in\r\nstatus quo.\r\n\r\nThe words used to paint the picture in Chicago may be repeated in\r\nWashington, but with emphasis and re-emphasis. Here they took mile\r\nafter mile of fine old dwellings on wide, tree-lined streets. And they\r\nalso overran the slums. But Washington, despite the anguished yelps of\r\nthe do-gooders, long was and now is practically slum-free.\r\n\r\nSome rookery regions are on F St. and New Jersey Ave. near the Union\r\nStation and Capitol. But there are poor whites living in hovels equally\r\ndepressed. On the other hand, 95 per cent of the Negroes live in\r\nlodgings as good as and better than most white residents’. Negroes have\r\ntaken over most of the desirable blocks near the government offices and\r\ndowntown.\r\n\r\nWe have before us an article on “The Negro in Washington,” in a recent\r\nissue of _Holiday_ magazine, a slick-paper, 50-cent pleader for\r\nleftist causes, published, curiously enough, by the staid, rich and\r\nconservative house of Curtis, owners of the _Saturday Evening Post_.\r\nThis effusion is illustrated with four pages purporting to show the\r\nNegro’s treatment in Democracy’s capital, which the editors call a\r\n“democratic contradiction.” There are photographs of Negro children\r\nat play in cluttered backyards which are called typical of the city’s\r\novercrowded Negro slums. Another picture shows a Negro woman in an\r\nalley dwelling; another is captioned, “Capitol Dome presents a contrast\r\nof obvious irony to the Negro slums which it overshadows. Overcrowding,\r\ndirt and disease are all prevalent.”\r\n\r\nYour authors traveled up and down 1,000 miles of streets and\r\nboulevards, 404 of alleys, not once but a dozen times. They saw the\r\nslums illustrated in _Holiday_ magazine, but they saw few others,\r\nbecause there are few others. At the most, 20,000, of a total of\r\n400,000 Negroes, live in these “slums,” which, even at their worst, are\r\nturreted castles compared to the degraded dwellings in which Negroes\r\nand myriad whites are forced to live in New York.\r\n\r\n_Holiday_ did not print one picture showing the thousands of fine homes\r\nand small apartment buildings in which most of Washington’s Negroes\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nCup your ear and we’ll let you into a little secret about these\r\n“slums.” Whether you read _Holiday_ or not, you’ve seen the pictures,\r\nbecause they are the ones which are always used by Reds and Pinks\r\nto point up to the world how gruesomely America treats its dark\r\nstep-children. The reason you’ve seen these pictures--always with the\r\nCapitol dome in the background--is that there are no others available.\r\n\r\nEleanor Roosevelt was one of the chief propagandists who exploited this\r\n“blot” on Washington. This particular slum, always photographed, always\r\non every sight-seeing itinerary, is only a couple of blocks long and is\r\nsurrounded on all sides by presentable Negro homes. But this slum is\r\npermitted to remain behind the Capitol only so the lefties will have\r\nsomething to breast-beat over. It remained there during the Roosevelt\r\nadministration, when public housing and public building projects were\r\nreshaping the face of Washington, only because an official who was in\r\nMrs. Roosevelt’s confidence ordered it undisturbed--for propaganda\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the National Association for the Advancement of\r\nColored People is in a ramshackle old house near the New Jersey Avenue\r\nslums. These are the specious ones referred to elsewhere, which are\r\nkept untouched and maintained to impress visitors with the shocking\r\ndegradation forced on Negroes in view of the Capitol dome.\r\n\r\nThe N.A.A.C.P. is rich and could locate in one of the prosperous, more\r\nimposing Negro sections. But that would wipe out the psychological\r\nadvantage of bringing its visitors through the stage-managed\r\nslave-quarters area.\r\n\r\nUnder Negro occupancy, some of the best dwellings in Washington, once\r\nresidences of ambassadors, cabinet officers and the hated capitalists,\r\nnow look like the slums the Fair Dealers decry.\r\n\r\nIn Washington, a Southern town with a Southern mentality, Negroes are\r\nnot popular, are not accepted as brothers except by a nagging and noisy\r\nminority. The Negro is not Jim Crowed in street cars. There is no\r\nlaw against a Negro’s attending a theatre with whites, eating in the\r\nsame restaurant or sleeping in the same hotel. But the law has upheld\r\nproprietors who refuse to serve a Negro, though United States Supreme\r\nCourt decisions have gone otherwise elsewhere.\r\n\r\nYet there is considerable intermixture between the races. It is not\r\nuncommon to see white girls with colored men, especially jazz band\r\nmusicians, who seem to exert a magnetic appeal for Caucasian women\r\nall over the country. Many Negro madames and pimps employ white girls\r\nfor their colored trade. In some New Deal left-wing circles it is\r\nconsidered chi chi to meet socially and even sexually with Negroes,\r\nthough, because of accepted restrictions against Negroes in the better\r\nspots, these contacts are not evident in the better public gathering\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nWhite people frequent colored night spots. Most of the reputed 480\r\nNegro after-hour bottle-clubs cater also to whites, though no white\r\nclub admits Negroes except possibly a prominent entertainer or band\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to find white women living with colored men.\r\nPractically no instance has come up in recent years of white men\r\nconsorting with colored women, except temporary pick-ups or in brothels.\r\n\r\nA raid on the Logan Hotel, at 13th Street and Rhode Island Avenue,\r\ndisclosed a white girl living with a Negro. She was the daughter of a\r\nTexas physician.\r\n\r\nPolice answered a trouble call at 17th and Q Streets and found a white\r\ngirl, employed by the Social Security Administration, visiting with a\r\ncolored janitor. He confessed that six other white girls from the same\r\nU. S. agency visited him regularly for intercourse, one each night--and\r\npaid him for it.\r\n\r\nAnother white girl employed by the Government was arrested at her home\r\nin Alexandria, after having received marijuana from a colored musician\r\nnamed Brisco. Brisco, well-known in Washington, mailed the marijuana\r\nfrom New York. According to U.S. Narcotics Agents, two white Washington\r\ngirls under 18 admitted smoking marijuana with him and said they had\r\nunnatural sex relations with him--they were afraid of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nDue to determined efforts of local reformers, Jim Crow seems to be on\r\nthe way out in Washington, as it is everywhere and should be. Until\r\n1949, the city’s six public swimming pools were restricted, to either\r\nwhites or Negroes. In 1948, the last year of such rules, the total\r\nnumber of swimmers was 415,000, of which only 69,000 were Negroes. Two\r\npools were set aside for colored and four for white. In 1949, when\r\nthere were no racial bars, total attendance dropped off to 332,000.\r\nOne pool, Anacostia, was shut down for most of the summer after\r\ndisturbances started when colored swimmers first attempted to use the\r\npool. McKinley’s white patrons stopped using it completely.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that whites would have learned tolerance by 1950, and\r\ntoward the end of the season many of the loudest crack-pots brayed\r\nabout the success of the new policy. In the fall of 1950, Eleanor\r\nRoosevelt, in her syndicated column, mumbled about how all friction was\r\nended and the millennium had arrived. As usual she was wrong. Official\r\nfigures released a few days later showed attendance had skidded another\r\n33 percent, down to a total of 220,000, of which--and get this--only\r\none-third were Negroes. In other words, whites had almost stopped using\r\nthe pools; on the other hand, there were barely more Negro patrons than\r\nwhen the pools were restricted. Agitation was heard from tax-payers to\r\nshut the pools, now run at a heavy loss to the city.\r\n\r\nOnly in public schools does legal Jim Crowism hold out. Recently a\r\nperformance of a tableau representing the Sesquicentennial of the\r\nfounding of the city was banned from the stage of a high school\r\nauditorium because it had a mixed cast. The school board said:\r\n“Congress makes the law and we enforce it.” There is a technical\r\nquestion about whether a colored member of the board may visit white\r\nschools, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nAdopting tactics employed by the National Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Colored People elsewhere, Washington Negroes and\r\nwhites who are trying to break down racial restrictions often picket\r\nrestaurants and other facilities which refuse to serve Negroes, and\r\nsometimes stage sitdown strikes within them. After such an experiment\r\nin the John R. Thompson chain, the demonstrators for racial equality\r\nwere arrested for disorderly conduct and sentenced by a judge who at\r\nthis writing has not been overruled.\r\n\r\nBut the lot of Negroes is enviable compared to that of their brethren\r\nelsewhere. We called Chicago’s Bronzeville Black Paradise. But that was\r\nbefore we saw Washington’s Negro Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe life of the Washington Negro is made pleasant by the force of many\r\ncircumstances. The odds are he is employed by the government, which\r\nhas raised salaries. If he doesn’t work for the government, he serves\r\ngovernment workers. He shares in the highest per capita earnings, yet\r\nthe cost of living in Washington is not so high as in New York and many\r\nother large cities. All streets, in white sections or colored, are\r\nbroad and tree-lined.\r\n\r\nNo Negro is ever fired from a government job if it can possibly be\r\nhelped. When necessary to cut down a staff, the whites go first,\r\nreversing the process of private business.\r\n\r\nIf they can’t do their work, whites are hired to do it over for\r\nthem. An instance, typical of thousands, occurred in the Bureau of\r\nthe Census, where five Negro women were so inefficient that their\r\ndepartment head requested permission to discharge them. His immediate\r\nsuperior almost had a stroke.\r\n\r\n“If Eleanor hears about this,” he gasped, “there’ll be hell to pay.”\r\n\r\nEleanor no longer lives in the White House. But she is still a potent\r\nforce in Washington, where her kitchen cabinet continues to rule the\r\nnation that President Truman thinks he rules.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the matter was that the section head was told to keep the\r\nfive colored women and to hire five white girls to do the work over for\r\nthem, on the night shift.\r\n\r\nThe same sort of favoritism is shown Negro job-holders and applicants\r\nthroughout the whole governmental set-up in the District. When a white\r\nman wants to become a cop he takes a stiff civil service test and is\r\nsubject to a searching investigation. Most of the Negroes who have been\r\ngetting on the force recently did it on political pull.\r\n\r\nKid-glove handling of Negroes is the rule in every phase of Washington\r\nlife, in addition to favoritism in appointments to the public payroll.\r\n\r\nApparently no effort is made by the police and other public authorities\r\nto enforce the liquor laws in the dark sections. The local Alcoholic\r\nBeverage Control code provides that no one may be served while\r\nstanding. Bar customers must be seated on stools, and even then may be\r\nserved only beer and wines. Hard liquor may be consumed only at tables.\r\nThis is strictly enforced in resorts catering to whites. But almost\r\nall colored saloons sell liquor openly over the bar, where drinkers\r\nstand--as long as they can stand. Few attempts are made to restrict\r\ngambling or policy-slip sales in the colored sections.\r\n\r\nAlmost 500 Negro after-hour clubs are running, most of them not even\r\nbothering to get club charters. Thousands of Negro flats are operated\r\nas blind pigs, where liquor, mostly gin, is sold openly to all comers\r\nat all hours. None has a license, naturally.\r\n\r\nOccasionally hokum raids are made and sometimes the defendants are\r\nfined $25. Next day they are in business as usual. Honest policemen\r\nare afraid to make too many pinches in Negro neighborhoods for fear\r\nthe pinkos will list them as “nigger-haters” and send their names up\r\nabove--maybe even to the White House. One cop whose name we will not\r\nmention told us that one night after he pulled in a colored after-hour\r\nspot, word came directly from the White House to the 13th precinct\r\nstation, in which the arrest had been made, to lay off. F.D.R. was\r\nPresident then.\r\n\r\nDespite the maudlin tears of reformers about the horrible conditions\r\nexisting in Washington’s “Negro Ghetto,” there are probably more new\r\nCadillac convertibles being driven from its doors than from any others.\r\nSleek, new, expensive convertibles of the flashier brands have become\r\nthe sine qua non of Negro policy-peddlers and reefer-pushers here,\r\nas well as in all other major American cities. Respectable people are\r\nreturning to the old-fashioned closed models for fear their bankers\r\nwill wonder what they’ve been up to.\r\n\r\nYet, despite the flashy visible prosperity of Washington’s Negroes, a\r\ndisproportionate number are on public relief. Many draw dole and social\r\nsecurity checks under one name while gainfully employed at one or two\r\njobs under other names. This racket, invented for the residents of New\r\nYork’s Harlem and Little Puerto Rico, has been brought to its full\r\nflower in Washington.\r\n\r\nThe humanitarians and the New Dealers, worrying about colored votes in\r\nthe northern states, help to put butterfat in the colored man’s milk\r\nin the capital. If the colored man works it right, he can get a relief\r\ncheck the first day he lands in Washington.\r\n\r\nThis story wasn’t published, but the federal agents who made the pinch\r\nand compiled the record had carried it on their chests so long, they\r\nached to unburden it where it wouldn’t come back and bite them. When\r\nthey broke in on a Negro whom they suspected of selling narcotics,\r\nhe indignantly asserted, “You can’t arrest me. I am a friend of Mrs.\r\nRoosevelt.”\r\n\r\nTo prove it, he brought out a couple of letters from the First Lady,\r\none of which was addressed “Dear Jim,” or “Joe,” stating she was sorry\r\nto hear that his relief check had not arrived on time, and she would\r\nsee that he was not pushed around in the future--he shouldn’t worry.\r\nThe boys arrested him and got a conviction.\r\n\r\nMrs. Roosevelt, while in the White House and out, sincerely sought to\r\nimprove the position of Negroes everywhere. But sometimes her efforts\r\nwent to such extremes she hurt the cause. Once she made a reservation\r\nfor a small banquet party of sixty at the swank Hay-Adams House, across\r\nthe street from the White House. When the managers discovered it was to\r\nbe an interracial affair they cancelled it. On September 14, 1950, Mrs.\r\nRoosevelt tried to register three Negroes in her party into the Willard\r\nHotel. She was staying elsewhere, with friends. The Willard refused.\r\n\r\nWhite property-owners tremble at the financial danger that would result\r\nshould Negroes crash white residential areas.\r\n\r\nBut entry is made through a tactic known as “block-busting,” developed\r\nby the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and\r\nutilized by it and by white real estate agents out to make a buck.\r\n\r\nGovernment agents first heard about it when they arrested a Negro woman\r\non narcotics charges and asked her for her occupation. She replied with\r\ndignity, “I’m a block-buster.” She explained to the mystified T-Men\r\nthat she was employed by a real estate shark and her duties were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nWhen her employers had scouted an all-white neighborhood they thought\r\nripe for plucking, they would find a white property-owner who, for a\r\nbonus, was willing to sell his property to a Negro. If the place was\r\nworth $25,000 he would be bribed with as much as another $25,000 to\r\nsell out. There are few neighborhoods where not one greedy white man\r\ncould be found after a searching survey by private detectives.\r\n\r\nAfter the block-buster--in her own name--made the purchase, she and her\r\nlarge Negro family moved in. Immediately, all other property in the\r\nneighborhood sank in value and most of it was thrown on the market. The\r\nfar-sighted realtors then bought it up at greatly reduced values. Then\r\nthey resold it or rented it to Negroes at inflated prices, and started\r\nanother Negro island in the city.\r\n\r\nWhen this was accomplished, the block-buster moved on to another base\r\nand repeated the process.\r\n\r\nYou can sense a neighborhood in the process of being block-busted\r\nby “For Sale” signs on porches or lawns, oddities in this otherwise\r\noverpopulated, under-housed metropolis.\r\n\r\nIn cities where Negroes and whites live in separate and distinct\r\nsections, opportunities for racial strife and violence are rare.\r\nIn Washington, where they live side by side all over, use the same\r\nstreet cars and buses, patronize the same stores and constantly brush\r\nshoulders on the streets, there is friction which sometimes flares\r\nhigh and hot. Some of their leaders advise Negroes to be assertive,\r\naggressive, to demonstrate their equality. They pick fights and needle\r\nCaucasians, most of whom are afraid to make complaints, because when\r\nthey get into court the federally appointed Yankee judge, whose robe\r\nwas bestowed upon him by a “civic rights” President, in many instances\r\nfinds for the Negro and castigates the white complainants, especially\r\npolicemen.\r\n\r\nAmong Negroes on the national political level who most zealously fight\r\nto assert prerogatives of their race in the capital are:\r\n\r\nCongressman William Dawson, vice chairman of the Democratic National\r\nCommittee, chairman of the mighty House Committee on Executive\r\nExpenditures. He represents Chicago’s vile Bronzeville and is a\r\npatronage-dispenser for the malodorous Cook County Democratic Central\r\nCommittee. He is extremely friendly with big shots of the infamous\r\nMafia, which controls all crime and corruption in the United States.\r\nBefore a Congressional Committee, Dawson was charged with being the\r\ndefender of the rackets. The charge was made by the late Bill Drury,\r\nformer Chicago police captain, who was slain by assassins who ambushed\r\nhim in an alley after Drury tried to reach the Kefauver Committee in an\r\neffort to put the full inside story of the underworld on the record.\r\n\r\nCongressman Adam Clayton Powell, Democrat from New York’s Harlem, who\r\nusually voted hand-in-glove with Marcantonio. He is supported in every\r\nelection by the successors of “Dutch” Schultz, whose policy-slip and\r\nmurder ring had its headquarters in what is now Powell’s district. He\r\nis married to Hazel Scott, Negro pianist, who has been frequently cited\r\nby Congressional and Legislative committees as indicating pro-Russian\r\nproclivities. She has denied it. He and his wife live in a swank Long\r\nIsland home, far from his bailiwick, and ride in a chauffeur-driven\r\n$6,000 limousine.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hastie, former governor of the Virgin Islands, now the first\r\nNegro on the exalted bench of the United States Circuit Court of\r\nAppeals. In volume 17 of the published records of the Special Committee\r\non Un-American Activities of the House of Representatives, Judge Hastie\r\nwas cited as belonging to at least five Communist-front organizations.\r\nHe was, however, subsequently appointed to the Federal bench by\r\nPresident Truman.\r\n\r\nWherever Negroes live, they have their own snobberies, castes and\r\nsocial strata. Rich ones and light ones are contemptuous of the poor\r\nand the black, and toward them they more often use the tabooed word\r\n“nigger” than do most whites. And they add one extra prejudice, not\r\nfound among whites--resentment of the native-born Negro for the recent\r\ncomer from the Southern plantations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. MIGHTY LIKE A ROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a daily in Washington (as there are others in principal\r\ncities) which never identifies a Negro as such unless he wins a Nobel\r\nprize or is selected the rookie of the year.\r\n\r\nWe protest. News cannot be honestly reported by arbitrarily slurring\r\nfacts. Of almost all other non-whites, many are marked by recognizable\r\nnames. Most Negroes have Anglo-Saxon names, many of them adopted\r\ncenturies ago from their slave-owners. For instance, Thompson’s\r\nEbenezer evolved into Ebenezer Thompson.\r\n\r\nThat same newspaper does not bar true and fair reports of misdeeds by\r\npeople named O’Rourke or Ginsberg or Dinkelspiel or Stanislawsky or\r\nProtopulus or Garcia or Potapinsky or Napolitano. Concealment of the\r\nidentity as Negro distorts the truth, for the natural assumption then\r\nis that the miscreants are white and we have an unjustified libel on\r\nthe Caucasian population.\r\n\r\nThe most rabid Negro papers publish the crimes of their own people and\r\nthen editorialize on the cruel inequalities which help to cause them.\r\nThat is the proper use of freedom of the press. Arbitrary withholding\r\nof vital facts is an impertinence and a misuse of the common franchise.\r\n\r\nFancy if you can what this chapter could not tell were we to suppress\r\nracial references.\r\n\r\nOf every four felonies and other breaches of the law in the grades\r\nwhere a defendant has the right of trial by jury more than three are\r\ncommitted by Negroes. That is not confidential, but official. Arrests\r\nfor Part One felonies--the more serious--in 1949 were as follows:\r\n\r\n        Colored males,     7,715.\r\n        Colored females,   1,085.\r\n        Total colored,     8,800.\r\n        White male,        2,396.\r\n        White female,        309.\r\n        Total white,       2,705.\r\n\r\nHere is a breakdown on some:\r\n\r\n        Murder, colored 40; white 8.\r\n        Manslaughter, colored 6; white 1.\r\n        Rape, colored 140; white 23.\r\n        Aggravated assault, colored 2,651; white 381.\r\n        Burglary, colored 2,322; white 640.\r\n\r\nNegrophiles and impractical activists for brotherhood of all God’s\r\nchildren campaign to force newspapers to omit racial identification of\r\nthe lawless and hide it with white lies. That is the foggy, unrealistic\r\npolicy of visionaries, sparked by the cold, hard practicality of Reds.\r\n\r\nArrests for Part Two felonies (less serious) and important misdemeanors\r\nshowed an even higher incidence of Negro crime.\r\n\r\nEstimating the Negro population at 50 percent, this means half the\r\npeople commit 85 percent of all the crimes. As will be shown in a later\r\nchapter, a large quota of the white crimes can be charged to transients.\r\n\r\nThe data on crimes by whites are incontrovertible. Those by Negroes\r\nin Washington, as well as in all other northern cities, do not give\r\nthe full picture. Most police officers prefer not to arrest blacks,\r\nespecially if there is no white complainant. They have nothing to gain\r\nby such a pinch; they merely invite an uproar for “persecuting the\r\ngentle Negro.”\r\n\r\nMany colored law breakers are never arrested; many who are are not\r\nbooked, the officers often preferring to mete out summary punishment\r\non the back stairs, which they know is a better deterrent than the\r\ninevitable discharge or suspended sentence by a timid, “seen” or\r\nleft-wing judge.\r\n\r\nIf you doubt that, the following is from the record of a Congressional\r\nhearing and there are plenty of other stories like it:\r\n\r\nPrivate Hamilton was assigned with Detective Sergeant Clyde Rouse for\r\nmidnight cruising. They observed a stolen car parked on Q Street NW,\r\nwith two occupants.\r\n\r\nRouse and Hamilton walked up to the car. Rouse went to the left and\r\nHamilton to the right. Rouse recognized the driver as Charles W. Scott,\r\ncolored, 24, of 476 O Street NW, wanted for questioning in connection\r\nwith stolen auto hold-ups.\r\n\r\nRouse opened the door and tried to seize Scott, but only succeeded in\r\nshoving the gear shift lever out of gear. Rouse was on his knees on\r\nthe front seat, practically on top of the other occupant of the car, a\r\nwoman, who proved to be Marian Holston, 20, colored, of 16 Q Street NW,\r\nwho had been picked up by Scott.\r\n\r\nRouse made a desperate effort to reach the key to cut off the motor but\r\nthe woman fought him, kicking, scratching, and biting. The Negro driver\r\nof the stolen car shoved the gear lever in and with the accelerator\r\ndown to the floor board, rocketed the car into high speed. Hamilton,\r\nhis head and shoulders through the window, holding on to the wheel,\r\nattempted to steer. It was impossible for either officer to jump or\r\nlet go. The stolen car finally collided with a barricade, ran over the\r\nsidewalk.\r\n\r\nWith Rouse still fighting to gain control, and Hamilton still\r\nstruggling, the car, without headlights and at a terrific speed\r\ncollided with a tractor trailer truck. The stolen auto was completely\r\ndemolished.\r\n\r\nPrivate Hamilton was killed.\r\n\r\nScott had a record which showed he had been committed eight times as a\r\njuvenile delinquent on charges of larceny, and in 1943 was sentenced to\r\nfrom two to five years for auto stealing. Thereafter he was involved in\r\nsix charges of robbery.\r\n\r\nBut the U.S. Attorney’s office refused to prosecute the Negroes and the\r\npolice were advised that if they insisted on going through with charges\r\nbefore a judge, the DA’s office would nolle prosse the case, because\r\nthey did not believe “a conviction could be obtained” against colored\r\npeople who had so unfortunately become involved in the killing of a\r\npoliceman. But when a policeman kills a Negro in the line of duty, the\r\npolitically chosen District Attorney is frequently highpressured by the\r\nN.A.A.C.P. into bringing murder charges.\r\n\r\nWe have pointed to the misguided tendency to minimize the size and\r\nextent of the Negro population. If more than half of Washington’s\r\npopulation is not black, the per capita crime rate is even more\r\nappalling.\r\n\r\nLike white crime, Negro crime is organized and syndicated. This does\r\nnot mean every rapist, hold-up man and car-thief takes orders from\r\nabove. But it means that when he gets in trouble he does seek certain\r\ndirected sources for bail-bonds, lawyers and fixers.\r\n\r\nPolicy-sellers, bookmakers’ runners, reefer peddlers and junk salesmen\r\nare employed by an organization which protects them also.\r\n\r\nThe process, as it works here, will be described in detail in the\r\nchapters devoted to crime and law enforcement, as it is part of the\r\ngeneral picture of organized evil.\r\n\r\nIn Washington, as in other cities, Negro crime on the consumer and\r\ngo-between levels is operated and controlled by Negroes. They report\r\nto, kick back to, and make their fixes at upper levels with, white\r\ncriminals. The topmost control rests in the hands of the international\r\nSyndicate, the Mafia, the Unione Siciliano. The Washington Negro\r\ncrime-ring has more autonomy than usual, because there are few\r\nSicilians and even fewer interested in crude crime. The national\r\nSyndicate prefers not to show its bloody hands openly in the capital,\r\nbut lurks in the background--in New York, principally.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful Washington Negro is the aforementioned Puddin’ Head\r\nJones. Jim Yellow Roberts is the boss of dope and reefers. He makes his\r\nbuys in wholesale lots in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, direct\r\nfrom the importers. While temporarily embarrassed by a jail sentence,\r\nRoberts continued to run the Negro dope trade.\r\n\r\n“Whitey” Simpkins is king of the Black Belt’s numbers racket. Johnny W.\r\nCarter, who owns the Club Bali, a black-and-tan resort, is one of the\r\ngamblers’ chiefs. Their payoff is a percentage which eventually reaches\r\nthe Syndicate through channels which will be set forth in detail in the\r\nchapter devoted to dope and gambling in Washington.\r\n\r\nOne of Washington’s most important Negro underworld figures is Lamarr\r\n(Polly) Brown who has been implicated in every form of illegality from\r\noperating after-hour clubs to the sale of narcotics. Odessa Madre,\r\nknown as the “Queen of the Fences,” is just what her honorific implies.\r\n\r\nFollowing the white pattern, the largest, gayest and most colorful\r\nNegro section is also laid out in NW. This part of town abounds with\r\ncolored flats where a white man may take a white or colored woman.\r\nThese holes sell gin without licenses, provide bedroom accommodations\r\nfor those who want them, and girls for those who don’t have them.\r\n\r\nMany Negro cab-drivers pimp for white girls, first getting acquainted\r\nwith them when they pick them up as passengers. They set them up in\r\napartments, most of which are in NW, and sell their services to white\r\nor colored men. These cabbies also handle reefers and after-hour liquor.\r\n\r\nIf you rode with us in Washington, through the NW colored section,\r\nthese are some of the things we could have shown you:\r\n\r\nFirst, we parked our car at the corner of 10th and B Sts., in front of\r\nthe Lincoln Barbeque. We waited five minutes, a colored man came out of\r\nthe restaurant and took our order for bootleg liquor. It happened after\r\ntwo, when the bars were closed. His prices were moderate, no more than\r\n50 cents to a dollar above the established tariff. But the stuff was\r\nmoonshine and cut.\r\n\r\nLet’s go to 1919 14th Street NW. This house was formerly the Star Dust\r\nClub, an after-hour drinking and gambling place. Now it’s a shoeshine\r\nparlor. It’s owned by William J. “Foots” Edwards, a notorious Negro\r\ngambler. If you want a game, you can find stud in the basement.\r\n\r\nThe dark corner of 5th and K looks quiet and serene. The colored\r\ndamsels who parade past here singly and by twos are not. Stop your car\r\nat the corner and they will come over and solicit you. Business all\r\nnight. If you’re a Negro you’ll know where to take them. If you are a\r\nwhite man they’ll go along in your car to an alley or steer you to a\r\nbuggy rooming-house. Another corner frequented by dusky hustlers in\r\nsearch of white trade is 9th and Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nAt about this time, we’ll run through the 7th Street district, which\r\nis the Broadway of the NW Negro section, with the chief shops,\r\nrestaurants, night clubs and theatres. You can make pick-ups anywhere\r\naround 7th, Georgia and Florida Avenues, but these streets are brightly\r\nlighted, so most white men who want to change their luck play the\r\ndarker streets. And there it is not unusual to see white girls brace\r\nblack men.\r\n\r\nIn addition to sex on sale at the corner of 7th and Florida, you can\r\nbuy reefers or policy slips.\r\n\r\nU Street, from 7th to 15th, is another bright light belt in the colored\r\nsection. The Dunbar Hotel and the Whitelaw are the swank Negro inns.\r\nThe Dunbar was once the aristocratic white Courtland Hotel. In its\r\nbasement is the 20-11 Club, one of the Nation’s best-known colored\r\ncabarets, which caters to the cream of the colony and is patronized\r\nalso by white novelty-seekers. Rich and visiting Negro celebrities\r\ncheck in at the Dunbar. So do Feds and cops, who have occasionally made\r\npinches there for narcotics and morals violations. In the 20-11 Club\r\nyou can pick up girls of any race.\r\n\r\nOn the corner of 7th and T are three hot spots--the Off Beat Club, for\r\nmusicians, the Club Harlem, and the Seventh and T Club. We saw them\r\nserve drinks after hours and cater to fairies of all shades, female\r\nwhite thrill-chasers and Negro reefer addicts.\r\n\r\nWashington, like Chicago, is a city of alleys in every block of\r\nresidential property and many business squares, bisected by the rear\r\npassages. As in Chicago, they are conducive to crime, afford dark,\r\nnarrow lanes for rape, assault, robbery and the pleasanter crimes of\r\ncrap shooting and soliciting.\r\n\r\nIn some Negro sections where housing is at a premium, they live in\r\nshacks in the alleys. These are some of the slums already referred\r\nto--not many, but picturesque and odoriferous. One of the best-known\r\nis an alley oddly named Temperance Court. If white people lived\r\nthere it would be fashionable at premium rents; it is similar to the\r\naristocratic Washington Mews in New York’s Greenwich Village. But\r\nit is inhabited by some of the lowest members of the Negro race in\r\nWashington--and that means low.\r\n\r\nTemperance Court is between 12th and 13th, T and U Streets, near the\r\n13th precinct station. More dope peddlers and ginmill operators are\r\nannually arrested in this block than on any other street of comparable\r\nsize anywhere in the world. You can buy anything you want there--girls,\r\nbootleg whiskey, cocaine and marijuana, stolen property, guns and\r\nknives, articles of perversion and sadism. Anything but a virgin past\r\nthe age of puberty.\r\n\r\nA notorious dope peddler operated there until recently and may still be\r\nthere when this comes out. He is John Frye. He has so many children,\r\nsome sleep on the roof, four on a bed, and there is always a new baby\r\nin the carriage. Narcotics agents said he hid junk in the baby’s\r\ndiaper. A competitor in the same block was Wilbur Kenny, known to the\r\ncokies merely as “Y.”\r\n\r\nAnother byway in the NW Negro section, which is unpublicized in the\r\nslick magazines, is Goat Alley, off 7th Street, near M. This is\r\nterribly tough, with reefer peddlers, two-dollar wenches, a mugging\r\na minute and murders common. Close by the Negro sections of crime\r\nand perversion is Ledroit Park, once surrounded by the mansions of\r\naristocracy. This is back of Griffith Stadium, which, like Comiskey\r\nPark, home of the Chicago White Sox, is engulfed in a sable sea.\r\nBaseball lovers must travel through miles of dangerous streets to the\r\nstadium.\r\n\r\nNearby is Freedman’s Hospital, the world’s leading institution of its\r\nkind for colored people, one of the outstanding institutions in the\r\nworld. Its internes are Howard University medical graduates, and among\r\nthese are great doctors. They get plenty of practice. The worst Negro\r\nassault cases go to Freedman’s. On Friday and Saturday nights the\r\nfloors of its emergency wards look like slaughterhouses. Knifings are\r\nfrequent; shootings run second. Even on weekdays the place teems with\r\npolice interviewing victims.\r\n\r\nGarfield Hospital, also near a large Negro community, is the second in\r\nassault cases.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest Negro islands in NE has as its center Central\r\nAvenue--same name as Los Angeles’ Harlem, though purely coincidental.\r\n\r\nGamblers in the NE section get action above the colored poolroom at 507\r\n8th Street and E.\r\n\r\nSW’s colored section is one of the largest in Washington and perhaps\r\nthe oldest. It begins within a thrown stone’s distance of the Capitol\r\nand runs through to the Army War College. If you’ve read about this\r\nneighborhood in some pinkish publication before seeing it for yourself\r\nyou will be looking for something awful. But you will drive through\r\nmiles of wide avenues with deep lawns. They’re littered with rubbish\r\nand junk, of course. This homey residential section is reminiscent of\r\nGod-fearing, law-abiding middle-class sections in typical Southern\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nBut what goes on inside these cozy habitations is not sleepy. The\r\nstreets, so quiet by day, take on a sinister aspect at night. This\r\nwhole section is known as Bloodfield. It’s worth a white man’s or\r\nwoman’s life to walk there unaccompanied. Even respectable Negroes are\r\nnot safe.\r\n\r\nYoung colored hoodlums of both sexes, adept at mugging and knifing,\r\nprey on strangers. The white man who comes here for pastime will find\r\nhis luck all bad. The best he can hope for is a beating and maiming.\r\nBut white women who are known to be Negro lovers are given safe conduct\r\nby the men, though they are attacked often by Negro women who resent\r\nthe intrusion. These streets are barely patrolled by police.\r\n\r\nThe main shopping and drinking boulevards of the SW Negro section are\r\n4th and 7th Streets. Around here the Negroes moved into and drove out\r\nwhat there was of a Jewish ghetto. The street where Al Jolson lived as\r\na child and where his father practiced as a cantor is now all Negro.\r\n\r\nThe SW dope peddlers and whores make their hangout on 6½th Street. The\r\nchief madames are “Mamma Liz” and “Big Tit” Flossie.\r\n\r\nWe have indicated that many white women--especially government\r\nworkers--are receptive to sexual attentions of Negro men. But the\r\ncomparative ease with which a black man can get a white girl, even a\r\nso-called respectable one, does not seem to deter colored men from\r\ncommitting rape on women of their own race and whites.\r\n\r\nAs these lines were being written, all Washington was shocked and\r\nalerted when a 22-year-old South American girl, visiting with a\r\ndiplomatic family, was stalked, attacked and ravished in a park near\r\nArlington Cemetery by a Negro, who, Tarzan-like, leaped from a clump of\r\ntrees entirely naked.\r\n\r\nThe popular form of Negro attack is mugging, a process in which the\r\nassailant comes up behind a man or woman and throws his arm around the\r\nvictim’s throat, closing it sharply with the elbow out, and jabbing a\r\nknee into the small of the back.\r\n\r\nBut in Washington colored people call it “yoking,” derivation of the\r\nword unknown. It includes all forms of street assault. One process\r\nconsists of sneaking up behind a lone passer-by, usually one who\r\napparently has been drinking, and tapping him on the shoulder. As he\r\nturns around, he is hit square on the jaw with a stiff arm, then kicked\r\nin the groin when he falls. Most victims are robbed. But many young and\r\nexuberant Negroes get up yoking parties just for the joy and excitement.\r\n\r\nThree young colored boxers, aged 14, 16, and 17, terrorized Washington\r\na few months ago, committing at least 19 yoke robberies, netting more\r\nthan $2,000. The 17-year-old was a semifinalist in the 160-pound class\r\nin last year’s Golden Gloves tournament. The youngest boxed at a boys’\r\nclub. The 16-year-old was a quarter finalist in the 135-pound class.\r\nThese activities are said to breed good citizens.\r\n\r\nThe three bet among themselves which would land the first punch on the\r\nvictim and whether it would be a knockout.\r\n\r\nPolice arrest hundreds of Negro yokers every year, most of them in\r\ntheir teens. Thousands of yokings go unsolved. The yokers are usually\r\nhighly organized into juvenile gangs which fight also with home-made\r\npistols, sawed-off shotguns and switchblade knives.\r\n\r\nMany of these young Negro gangs terrorize students, white and black, in\r\npublic schools, offering to sell them “protection” and punishing them\r\nwhen they don’t pay up.\r\n\r\nStartled public officials first heard about these gangs some months\r\nago after incidents at Banneker High. An 18-year-old colored boy was\r\nheld for the grand jury on a charge of robbing a 15-year-old Banneker\r\nschoolboy of a wrist watch on the school playground. He threatened to\r\nwhip the younger boy if he talked. School officials were awakened to\r\nthe fact that all the schools in the city had this problem. According\r\nto the assistant superintendent of schools G. C. Wilkenson, “the gangs\r\nare made up of boys who aren’t in school and who aren’t working--mostly\r\nfrom 16 to 21 years old.”\r\n\r\nOfficials try to minimize the situation, but there is a wave of terror\r\nin every public elementary and high school. Young Negro gangsters lurk\r\nabout the schools, sell reefers, molest girls, and commit mayhem on\r\nchildren who won’t pony up. Boys and girls thus forced to pay tribute\r\nare told to steal from their parents or do a little shoplifting if they\r\nhave no other means of procuring the extortion money. Youngsters are\r\nput on heroin and morphine by the youthful gangsters, and soon enter a\r\nlife of serious crime.\r\n\r\nOther yokers use a tactic borrowed from the dacoits, a murderous\r\nreligious gang of India, throwing a cord over the victim’s head from\r\nbehind and garroting him.\r\n\r\nSome of these colored juvenile mobs have been in existence for 15 or 20\r\nyears. When boys and girls outgrow them and become adult criminals on\r\ntheir own, they are replaced by new children on the way up. Among the\r\nolder and better-organized kid mobs are the Fastest Runners, the Forty\r\nThieves, the Purple Cross Gang and the Protective Association.\r\n\r\nThe Fastest Runners is composed of younger boys who fight with\r\nswitch-blade knives. When they grow up they graduate into adult gangs.\r\nAll these organizations have female auxiliaries, membership in which\r\nrequires the young colored girls to solicit on the streets and turn the\r\nproceeds over to the boys. Girls as young as 11 participate and at 12\r\nare “debs,” with full standing.\r\n\r\nAmong offenses which are practically Negro monopolies in Washington are\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n_Numbers and policy slips._ Almost all numbers sellers, even in white\r\nneighborhoods and in government office buildings, are colored men and\r\nwomen. In other cities Sicilians, Puerto Ricans, Filipinos and Mexicans\r\nget in on this activity, but there are no sizeable groups of such in\r\nWashington. The modus operandi of numbers selling will be described in\r\nthe chapter on gambling.\r\n\r\n_Sale of reefers._ Almost all marijuana retailers are colored, which\r\nalso is unique to Washington.\r\n\r\n_Theft and conversion of government checks at the lower level._ The\r\nmen, because so many are janitors and elevator boys, have entree to\r\napartment buildings and tenement houses and access to mail-boxes. These\r\nthieves strike at the middle or at the end of the month, when checks\r\nare sent out by the Treasury for G.I. remunerations, Social Security\r\nbenefits, pensions, army subsistence and similar regular allotments.\r\nThose who do the manual stealing seldom attempt to cash the checks,\r\nwhich are turned over to fences, often white, including storekeepers\r\nand sometimes bankers.\r\n\r\nAnother Negro industry is _the sale of bootleg booze_. The rings\r\noperate in many fashions. On some streets you find peddlers who sidle\r\nup beside you, or come up to your car when you stop for traffic lights.\r\nMany shoeshine “parlors” are moonshine dispensaries. Groceries and\r\npoolrooms also sell, usually gin, but sometimes what is supposed to be\r\nbourbon--corn for the Southern taste. The gin is mixed with cider to\r\ndilute the taste of raw kerosene and the combination has a wallop.\r\n\r\nThat good old Negro money-raising institution, known as “the rent\r\nparty” elsewhere, has a specific, generic name in Washington, where\r\nit’s called a “chitlin party.” Chitlins, hogs’ innards, are a delicacy\r\nin some blacker parts of the South and are used here as a decoy\r\nto attract guests to the homey brawls which are a regular part of\r\nBlacktown’s social life. In New York’s Harlem and Chicago’s Bronzeville\r\nthe paying guest at a rent party gets nothing in exchange for his\r\ncontribution except the right to bring his woman, drink his gin, and\r\nget into the fracas.\r\n\r\nWe met a white fellow who has run Washington’s chitlin industry up into\r\na million-dollar-a-year class. He gets the stuff from the butchers for\r\nnothing. They’re almost willing to pay him to cart it away. Then he\r\npackages it in 10-gallon jars which he sells for $2.50, or two bits a\r\ngallon. That means the capital’s Negroes consume 4,000,000 gallons a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThese chapters were, of course, not in print when a young man known as\r\n“The Sniper” was, for a few days, the most famous person in Washington.\r\nIf he were around now, our critics might have said we incited him. The\r\nSniper--a young white man--was a congenital Negro-hater. He boiled up\r\ninto an insane rage every time he saw a sable woman or man. He hid in\r\nvarious sections and hit bullseyes from roofs, behind trees and through\r\nopen windows.\r\n\r\nBefore he was caught there was a wave of terror. For days Negroes\r\nremained indoors. Crime sagged, because even the worst elements were\r\nafraid to leave their homes.\r\n\r\nPolice Lieutenant Barrett, now Major and Superintendent of the\r\nMetropolitan Force, got him after he had killed a half-dozen men and\r\nwounded scores.\r\n\r\nWhile the Sniper was in jail on suspicion, he met a drug addict, one\r\nRichard Harlowe, and confided in him where he had hidden his gun, in\r\nBaltimore. Barrett recovered it and came back to find his bird had\r\nescaped. He was recaptured in Georgetown. Barrett’s fame helped him to\r\nbecome the chief. His friends say it had nothing to do with the fact\r\nthat he was related to Major Edward Kelley, a previous chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. CHINATOWN CHIPPIES\r\n\r\n\r\nSam Wong, an owner of the China Clipper, Quonsett Inn, the Dragon and\r\nother popular restaurants, was indicted on a $250,000 tax fraud. The\r\ngovernment charged he gave most of it to two blondes--sisters--who\r\nlived with him. The case was tried in Baltimore. (_Note_: Though\r\nWashington is the nation’s capital, it is merely part of the Maryland\r\nInternal Revenue collection district.)\r\n\r\nWhen the case was called, the courtroom filled with poker-faced\r\norientals. The government called some, the defense called others,\r\nincluding Wong, whom it put on the stand.\r\n\r\nBut not one Chinese witness testified coherently. They gave their\r\nnames, addresses, and so on, muttered and mumbled irrelevant replies.\r\nEven the defendant remained mute after being put on the stand by his\r\nown attorney.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers had read _Chicago Confidential_, in which these reporters\r\nrevealed that Chinese will have no truck with American courts or\r\nAmerican law. So they gave a copy to the court and D.A., hoping the\r\njudge and jury would realize the impossible position in which the\r\ndefense legal battery was placed. It did no good. Wong got a year. The\r\nblondes weren’t Chinese--and they convicted him.\r\n\r\nSome go to Chinatown for chop suey and chow mein. We will write about\r\nthose who seek other delicacies.\r\n\r\nWashington’s Chinatown is neither as large as Frisco’s, as colorful as\r\nNew York’s, nor as odoriferous as Boston’s. You will see no ancient,\r\npajama-clad women on its streets, and only a few young slant-eyed\r\nSadies.\r\n\r\nChinatown is a mere three or four blocks on H Street, beginning\r\nin a block about 8th and extending barely to 5th. It’s almost all\r\nneon-lighted restaurants, with the shops of a few wholesale merchants\r\nand traders sandwiched in between. H is a typical wide Washington\r\nstreet with set-back buildings. If it weren’t for the garish Chinese\r\ncharacters on the illuminated signs and windows, and the pale\r\nyellow-faced men with sad old almond eyes sprawling on the stoops,\r\nyou’d think you were anywhere but in a Chinatown.\r\n\r\nAs in all Chinese quarters, various locations and various businesses\r\nare divided between the tongs. Only two operate in the East, though\r\nthere are scores in California.\r\n\r\nThe On Leongs are dominant here, though not in the nation, through an\r\nalliance with the Hip Sings, cemented many years ago, when they drove\r\nthe competing organizations back to the West Coast. Then they turned on\r\ntheir ally. After a series of bloody wars, they established themselves\r\nas the top dogs, with the Hip Sings the poor cousins.\r\n\r\nThe tongs are, primarily, trade and benevolent associations. Their\r\nmembership is comprised of certain families or immigrants from certain\r\nvillages in Canton. When the authorities clamped down on tong wars in\r\nthe 1930’s, the tongs began to enforce their decrees and decisions by\r\npeaceful means, which include trade and social boycott.\r\n\r\nAccording to members of the Chinese colony in Washington, there are\r\nonly 500 of them, but these figures are far out of line with our\r\ncount of at least 7,500. There are hundreds of Chinese restaurants\r\nand laundries in the town. Chinese always underestimate their\r\npopulation, as do Negroes. But with them there are more concrete\r\nreasons. Three-fourths are entered illegally, through many subterfuges,\r\nsuch as forged birth and marriage certificates, as well as actual\r\nbody-smuggling over the Mexican and Canadian borders and from the West\r\nIndies. The price of entering a Chinese now is $5,000, as against a\r\nmodest $1,000 twenty years ago. The fee is paid the smugglers by the\r\nChinaman’s tong or family society, for whom he then works to pay it\r\noff. Nowadays most of this illegal entry is by air.\r\n\r\nChinese are cagey at census time, because if the rolls show anywhere\r\nnear as many in the country as there are, the difference in numbers\r\nbetween those here and the ones on record would be so startling, it\r\nwould cause an investigation and wholesale deportation. Another reason\r\nis that they are on a gentlemen’s agreement quota basis with agents of\r\nthe Federal Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization. When an agent\r\nruns across a group of illegally-entered Chinese, he gets practical\r\nabout the whole matter.\r\n\r\nIf he turned them all up at once, he’d get a pat on the back from his\r\nsuperior, then have to go on a new job next week. But if he reports\r\nonly one every two weeks, he doesn’t have to do another lick of work\r\nfor months. So the agent makes a deal with the head of the tong, who\r\ndelivers the unfortunate Chinese at set intervals, and thus everyone is\r\nhappy: the government because it gets the Chinese, the agent because he\r\ncan loaf, and the wealthy Chinese laundry and restaurant owners, who\r\nare not suddenly faced with labor shortages.\r\n\r\nWashington’s Chinatown is important beyond its numerical strength\r\nbecause it acts as a lobby for Chinese all over the country, regardless\r\nof tong affiliation, and for Chinese merchants and enterprises all over\r\nthe world. There are not enough Chinese voters in the country to enable\r\nthem to influence elections, but they make up for lack of numbers by\r\nintelligence, ingenuity, wealth and Oriental cunning developed by\r\ncenturies of intrigue with no qualms of honor owed the white man.\r\n\r\nCommunists never overlook a trick. They quickly took advantage of the\r\nChinaman’s unique possibilities. Many Chinese are vulnerable because\r\nthey have relatives in the old country. Thus they are subject to\r\npressure. Many are technical law-breakers or illegal entrants, so the\r\nReds, with their influence in high places, can threaten effectively.\r\nChinese societies make swell “drops” for the transmission of messages\r\nand intelligence, and are being used, an angle not yet brought out\r\npublicly.\r\n\r\nThey’ll tell you it isn’t so, but some of the recent tong fighting is a\r\nwar between Nationalists and Communists.\r\n\r\nChinatown, only a few blocks from the White House, the Capitol and the\r\ncenter of the business and commercial life, is a focal point for all,\r\nwhites as well as Orientals, visitors and natives. In this town, where\r\nalmost everything shutters by midnight, the Chinese propensity for\r\nstaying up all night and sleeping most of the day has brought about\r\nseveral phenomena. Unless you are welcome at a bottle club, there is\r\nno late place to go to in Washington except Chinatown. Most of the\r\nrestaurants there are open all night, selling food. More than a few\r\nserve liquor after 2 A.M., if they know you, in a tea-pot.\r\n\r\nThere is hectic activity all evening. Most of the white bag-swinging\r\nstreet-hustlers work the neighborhood. Any cab-driver will direct you\r\nthere if you ask him, “Where can I get a girl?” These self-sellers\r\nusually ask $20, but will take what they can get. They go on duty at\r\naround 8, and by 10 most have made arrangements. From 10 to about 1 or\r\n2, the restaurants are taken over by respectable people, mostly young\r\ncouples who stop in for a bite of exotic food after the movies. After\r\n1, when the tarts have completed their rounds, they come back again\r\nfor more trade. At this time the drunks who have been ejected from the\r\ncocktail lounges and night clubs are transported wholesale by cab to\r\nChinatown. Many of the drivers have deals with certain girls and some\r\nof these girls have deals with the Chinese restaurants they habitually\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nMany of the hookers hang out at the Mai Fong.\r\n\r\nWe could find no Chinese whores in Washington. The proportion of\r\nChinese women to men is one to ten. Any Oriental girl, no matter\r\nhow homely, can make an attractive marriage. Many Chinese men are\r\nmarried to white women. There are no Chinese waitresses in the Chinese\r\nrestaurants, except an occasional relative of the owner; they are\r\nwhites. Few are for sale, but many will help get you one who is.\r\n\r\nWhen the tramps finish their second round with the guys they have\r\npicked up at 2, they come back to Chinatown at 5 or 6 in the morning,\r\nby which time the waiters, chefs and bartenders, all Chinese, are\r\nlocking up for the night and ready for a bit of shacking up themselves.\r\nMany of the prostitutes live with Chinese men from the restaurants and\r\nthe gambling joints. These are useful to the Chinese colony, which\r\nentertains influential white people lavishly. Many members of Congress,\r\nhigh government officials and influential lobbyists are feted at\r\nprivate parties, where they are served exotic twenty-course meals of\r\nraw octopus and lambs’ eyes, washed down by shark’s fin soup. Police\r\nChief Barrett, always accompanied by his aide-de-camp, a lieutenant, is\r\nfrequently entertained in these private rooms.\r\n\r\nAmiable blondes are supplied by the hosts if wanted, and rooms are\r\navailable down the block, at the Eastern House, a cheap Chinese and\r\nwhite hotel, where federal agents frequently pick up dope-peddlers.\r\n\r\nSelling narcotics is another large Chinese industry. Unlike other\r\ncities, it is not confined to selling to Chinese. In all other Eastern\r\ncities, opium, the favorite Chinese dream-smoke, is peddled by members\r\nof the On Leong Tong, who have the cream of everything, won through\r\nviolence and chicanery.\r\n\r\nIn other cities, Hip Singers must content themselves with the sale\r\nof white stuff--heroin, morphine and cocaine--which is seldom used\r\nby Chinese. In Washington, Chinese are among the main retail dope\r\npurveyors for the white trade as well as their own people. There are\r\nfew Puerto Rican and Italian drug passers available. So both tongs sell\r\neverything. Junkies cruise Chinatown at all hours of the day and night\r\nin search of dope, and can make a buy without any trouble. If anyone\r\nstands on a corner and looks sad for more than five minutes, he will be\r\napproached by a peddler.\r\n\r\nThe net result is that, with narcotics as with girls, the Chinese find\r\na potent weapon with which to further the interests of their fellow\r\nOrientals all over the country. More than one high government official\r\nis on dope, which he procures from Chinese dealers, who in turn have\r\nhim at their mercy because they control the source and because they\r\nhave the power of blackmail.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese import some, obtain the rest from the central Mafia sources\r\nin New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, or directly from abroad, as\r\nwill be described later. They frequently cooperate with the Mafia in\r\nsmuggling narcotics and other contraband. It is a matter of record\r\nthat many Chinese secret societies have worked with their ancient\r\nSicilian counterpart, the Mafia, over the centuries. Both Cantonese\r\nand Sicilians are widely dispersed over the world, but each faction\r\nis bound together by a common language and secret societies. Chinese\r\nsocieties are remarkable transmission belts. And among Chinese are many\r\nnatural-born gangsters--sly rather than bold in white men’s countries.\r\n\r\nDope can be hidden in rice, vegetables and even wet-wash. The Chinese\r\nsocieties also provide the Mafia with facilities for transporting\r\ncontraband money from country to country or from town to town.\r\n\r\nThere’s hardly a location in Chinatown without some form of gambling\r\ngoing on, quite often open to the street. Almost every restaurant has\r\na game in the rear. Many stores are blinds for the huge wagering that\r\ngoes on behind. If you came in and asked to buy some article you saw\r\nin the window, you’d be laughed at; they are usually dummy props. Huge\r\nsums are won and lost in these games, and bankrolls of a hundred or\r\ntwo hundred thousand dollars on the table are not unknown. This is\r\nalways syndicate money. Sometimes as many as 500 or 1,000 partners all\r\nover the country are in the play. These games go on 24 hours a day,\r\nwithout pause. Each syndicate’s players are chosen for their ability as\r\ngamblers. They play in teams with others who relieve them.\r\n\r\nWe saw open gambling in the Fong Wah Co., in Eng Hon, in the On Leong\r\nbuilding, and at numbers 601, 603, 606, 607, 608 H Street, in Chinatown.\r\n\r\nThe police know all about this gambling, but take no action unless\r\nwhite men put in a beef. They explain you can’t make a pinch stick on\r\nChinese: the games they play are not understandable to whites, and it\r\nis almost impossible to make an identification of an Oriental, or to\r\nget one to testify, for or against.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chinese hook a fat white sucker, the game moves every hour to\r\na different location.\r\n\r\nSixth Street, at H, is the dividing line between Hip Sing and On Leong\r\nterritory, with the Hip Sings below 6th, the less desirable part of\r\ntown. The division of businesses gives all restaurants to On Leongs\r\nand the laundries to Hip Sings, therefore all chop suey parlors in\r\nChinatown are above 6th Street.\r\n\r\nKwon Seto is the local On Leong boss and one of the most powerful men\r\nin Washington. George Moy, secretary of the On Leongs, is the “mayor”\r\nof Chinatown. A man named Yee is the real boss. Moy owns the Joy Inn,\r\nwhere an investigator for a crime committee was steered by a District\r\nofficial, then “mickeyed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. THE OVERFLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nOf every 100 residents of the metropolitan district, 45 live in the\r\nsuburbs--over the line in Maryland and across the Potomac in Virginia.\r\nThe take from these sections, in legitimate taxes and the proceeds of\r\nvice and crime, is so attractive that the city fathers of Washington\r\nhave their greedy eyes on annexing this adjoining land onto the\r\nvoteless District.\r\n\r\nAlmost everywhere else, unincorporated territory across city lines is\r\na world apart. These county sections usually look different, smell\r\ndifferent and are different from the city. They are bad or good,\r\nwhere people go to get away from the law, or go to get away from the\r\nlawlessness of the big city.\r\n\r\nThe border of D.C. is arbitrary. As the population of the capital grew,\r\nit spread. For all practical purposes, nearby Maryland and Virginia are\r\nas much a part of the city as any part of the city itself. Most of the\r\nresidents of the suburbs work in the capital.\r\n\r\nThe entire area is really one municipality, though those living in\r\nVirginia and Maryland can vote.\r\n\r\nThere are no caste or social lines between the District and the\r\nsuburbs. Society people may live in Washington, Virginia or Maryland.\r\nResidences of high government officials are spread over the three. The\r\nbig wheels of the underworld are likewise scattered. The same overlords\r\ncontrol the rackets in the entire metropolitan district.\r\n\r\nThe state lines provide gangsters with yet another safeguard.\r\nExtradition warrants are required to move them from one area to\r\nanother. For some specific crimes, the authorities are hampered by the\r\nfact that no extradition is authorized. Smart lawyers take advantage of\r\nthese false barriers. For instance, each day’s collection of lottery\r\nmoney in the District is moved into Maryland. Conversely, much of\r\nMaryland’s bookmaking take is deposited in District banks. That is all\r\ndone on legal advice.\r\n\r\nTechnically, police officers in hot pursuit may cross state lines\r\nto make arrests, even for traffic violations. But few crimes are\r\ncommitted in the presence of a cop, and almost never any involving the\r\nupper echelons of crime. The satellite regions are remarkably free\r\nof Negroes, who prefer the city which they have all but taken over.\r\nThat’s why the suburbs grew in size to such extent that Silver Spring,\r\nMaryland, adjacent to the District, of which outsiders seldom hear or\r\nread, is now the second largest city in the state.\r\n\r\nThe suburbs run the scale from swank sections where only those of\r\ngreat wealth reside to dingy squatters’ rows where moonshining, murder\r\nand mayhem are daily dillies. Most of the ritzier suburbs are on the\r\nVirginia side. Chain Bridge Way, Warrenton and Middleburg are peopled\r\nby the horsey set, where there are great estates lived in by possessors\r\nof ancient, honorable family names, as well as by the newly-made\r\naristocrats of the New Deal, union officers, left-wing lawyers,\r\nfive-percenters and State Department aides. Chevy Chase, partly in\r\nthe District, but mostly in Maryland, is tony, too. So is Bethesda,\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\nBut the great mass of suburbanites in both states are middle-class\r\ngovernment employes who commute to and from work, play bridge, go to\r\nthe movies and propagate.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen here, you can find almost anything in the way of crime\r\nor vice in Washington, but what you miss can usually be met in some\r\nof the Maryland suburbs when the heat isn’t on, especially in Prince\r\nGeorges County, which, for its size, probably has more slot-machines,\r\nstrip-teasers, resident hoodlums and general deviltry than any other\r\nplace in the world--subject to a “clean-up” in progress at this writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. Maryland_\r\n\r\nThis is the Free State, where anything goes.\r\n\r\nChicago has Cicero, Washington has Prince Georges County.\r\n\r\nThe same cause which gives Washington the unenviable lead as the Number\r\n1 law-breaker among cities--public apathy--is what usually makes Prince\r\nGeorges County unique among county areas of the country. Washington\r\ndoes not have the vote, the residents of Prince Georges do have it.\r\nAnd they exercise it by usually voting Democratic and corrupt. Last\r\nNovember they kicked over the traces for the first time since 1864.\r\nBut the Republican county commission won’t get far, even if it tries.\r\n\r\nWithout a dream of winning, the GOP nominated well-meaning nonentities\r\nwithout a policy, organization or knowledge of the local problems.\r\nTheir victory was as surprising to themselves as to these reporters.\r\n\r\nThe facts for this chapter were gathered shortly before the November\r\nelection. The new county government was sworn in on December 5.\r\nWe returned to Prince Georges in early February for a recheck and\r\nfound little changed. The new sheriff, Carlton Beall, made ten raids\r\nsince New Year’s Eve. But the strip-joints still ran, though not so\r\nblatantly. Instead of featuring the nudies in their ads, they gave them\r\nsecond billing and headlined the male M.C. instead. But the babes were\r\njust as bare.\r\n\r\nThe gambling was under wraps, too, but it still flourished. The big\r\ngamblers took the precaution of moving their books and their bank\r\naccounts back to the District, whence they had fled a decade ago.\r\n\r\nThe crime syndicate’s technique was to keep moving across county lines\r\nfrom Anne Arundel to Howard to Prince Georges in the area near Laurel,\r\nwhere the three join.\r\n\r\nThe militant Republicans fired the Chief of Police and appealed\r\nto Senator Kefauver for aid. At this writing, the Senate Crime\r\nInvestigating Committee tossed the hot potato right back into Maryland.\r\nOne of Kefauver’s four colleagues on the Committee is Senator Herbert\r\nO’Conor, Maryland Democrat, elected with the aid of the corrupt\r\nDemocratic machine so soundly trounced last November.\r\n\r\nThe second act of the new Republican commission was to hire another\r\nDemocrat to succeed the ousted Democratic Police Chief.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Georges border is a 15-minute drive from the heart of\r\nWashington. Depending on the road you take out of town, you soon reach\r\nBladensburg or Colmar Manor. The latter is Rum Row, with several blocks\r\nof dirty drinking-joints where wind-broken broads solicit drinks, roll\r\ndrunks and whore, often as a pastime when no dough is available.\r\n\r\nIf you go to Colmar Manor to spend money, Silver Spring in adjoining\r\nMontgomery County is the place where you can get money. This is no\r\ngag. The entire main street of Silver Spring and nearby Mount Rainier\r\nin Prince Georges is lined on both sides from the District border\r\nfor more than a quarter of a mile with personal loan agencies. This\r\nis because D. C. law makes it almost impossible for small loan firms,\r\nwhich lend you money on your own signature or that of co-signers,\r\nto operate. It so limits the interest rate as to make the business\r\nunprofitable, fixing it at one percent a month. On the other hand, both\r\nMaryland and Virginia are much more liberal with the loan companies.\r\nThe former allows three percent monthly and the latter two-and-a-half.\r\nThe Washington wage-earner, working for the government or privately\r\nemployed, does his borrowing across the borderline. If he should\r\ndefault, the loans are collectable in the District, though its courts\r\nare increasingly looking into the conditions under which the loan was\r\noriginally granted and refusing to issue judgments where they believe\r\nthe interest is usurious.\r\n\r\nMost Washingtonians know Prince Georges County as a place to go to have\r\nfun. This is not because Maryland’s laws, or even their enforcement,\r\nare more liberal than the District’s. With few exceptions, they are not.\r\n\r\nThe legal liquor closing on weekdays is 2 A.M. in both. No hard liquor\r\ncan be sold at all on Sundays. They cheat in Prince Georges.\r\n\r\nPrince Georges County is lined with dumps that specialize in\r\nstrip-teasers. There are also many fag-joints. Peeling isn’t against\r\nthe law in Washington, either. It goes on in the 9th Street burlesque\r\nhouses when they operate, and at Kavakos’, near the navy yard. But\r\nWashingtonians prefer not to patronize the nuders near home. Their\r\nfeeling of delicacy is overcome when they drive five miles.\r\n\r\nWashington’s huge homosexual colony overflows up to the Baltimore\r\nHighway and into a place called the Conga. Mike Young’s occasionally\r\nspecializes in fairy shows, too.\r\n\r\nPrince Georges is a long strip predominantly devoted to gaiety,\r\nnight life, gambling and whoring. At this writing, one of its most\r\nfamous places is in a barnlike structure called the Crossroads. It\r\nhas strippers and corny shows. Its huge bar is loaded for a pick-up.\r\nIn case you do, but are not prepared, “sanitary rubber goods” are\r\ndispensed in slot-machines in the men’s rooms. The night we were there,\r\nwe saw three fancy one-armed bandits whirring and swallowing. These\r\nwere manufactured by Bell, which means their take goes direct to Frank\r\nCostello, instead of reaching him indirectly through other subsidiary\r\ncompanies, which sell machines to local syndicates. The Crossroads is a\r\nhangout for hoodlums. We recognized some well-known police characters\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOne of its owners is local gambling overlord Snags Lewis, about whom\r\nmore later. Last year there was a shooting in the room, but Prince\r\nGeorges County Patrolman Burgess made no report because his father had\r\na piece of the place. Burgess is now off the force.\r\n\r\nThe Dixie Pig is a few yards down the road from the Crossroads. This\r\nbarbecue bazaar is a hangout for prostitutes and gamblers. It is owned\r\nby Earl Sheriff, who, strangely enough, was the sheriff of Prince\r\nGeorges before he went to Lewisburg penitentiary on an income tax\r\ncharge, after pleading nolo contendere to protect the top shots.\r\n\r\nSheriff, now out on parole, is still electioneering, fixing and\r\ncollecting campaign funds for the local Democratic machine. He worked\r\nhard for defeated Senator Tydings.\r\n\r\nWhile Sheriff was having his troubles, Ralph Brown, late chief of\r\nthe Prince Georges County Police, settled with the government out of\r\ncourt. The Democratic leaders of Prince Georges who were unaware of the\r\nvice there, or blind, are Congressmen Lansdale G. Sasscer, T. Howard\r\nDuckett, and T. Hampton Magruder. The latter two are attorneys.\r\n\r\nPrince Georges County has a police force of 41 men, plus its village\r\nand town cops. But the county never asks for State Troopers. That is\r\nnot surprising, because while we were gathering information for this\r\nbook the Prince Georges grand jury said there was no gambling in the\r\ncounty. We saw a lot of it with our own eyes. Maybe state cops could\r\nstumble on some of it. Maybe.\r\n\r\nClean-up or no, there usually are more floating crap-games, illegal\r\nbookies and after-hour spots in Prince Georges than there are in Reno,\r\nwhere all such things are legal. The Republicans may temporarily drive\r\nthem under cover--or back to the District--but those boys never stop.\r\n\r\nThe local Democratic machine was so powerful that, in 1947, the United\r\nStates Department of Justice had to intervene directly with Maryland’s\r\nthen Governor Lane to close down some joints. State troopers quickly\r\nshut all gambling houses--save one run by Mike Meyers, who was too\r\ncantankerous even for them. They finally drove him out by stationing\r\npolice-cars around his joint every night, and taking the names of\r\ncustomers. After the heat was off, however, the county reopened wide.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Georges underworld was ruled until his death last year by\r\nJimmy La Fontaine, who is known in gangland circles to have been a\r\n20-percent partner with Frank Costello, the Mafia boss in New York, who\r\nhandled the other 80 percent of the Prince Georges take. La Fontaine\r\nwas a big financial backer of the local Democratic machine, though his\r\nown plush gambling casino across the street from the District line\r\nis now closed, pending probate of his multi-million-dollar estate by\r\nAttorney Charlie Ford, who gets the cream of all gambling, whoring and\r\nother organized criminal cases in the District of Columbia, Maryland\r\nand Virginia.\r\n\r\nNow the underworld is run by lieutenants of those who operate as vice\r\noverlords in Washington. Among them are Monk Seal, the bookmaker, who\r\nalso has a piece of the Crossroads, and the aforementioned Mike Meyers,\r\nwho handles the dice end. Snags Lewis is the local representative of\r\nthe nationwide horse wire service, owned by the heirs of the late Al\r\nCapone, and is Frank Costello’s direct representative.\r\n\r\nPolicy-slip collections in the District are paid off to Pete Gianaris\r\nat night at the close of business. Gianaris is an interesting character\r\nwho ran a $50,000 party in the ballroom of the Statler Hotel to\r\ncelebrate the christening of his young son. This was cheap, considering\r\nthat he imported such expensive Broadway stars as Buddy Lester to\r\nentertain the cream of local society. He is a beloved, big-hearted\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nThe Costello interests were operating hundreds of slot-machines in\r\nPrince Georges. Some years ago, they were legalized by local option,\r\nbut they remained contrary to state law, which was not enforced. Some\r\nlocals, pushed out of the picture by Costello’s strongarm boys, started\r\na tax-payers’ suit in the state courts and the Prince Georges local\r\noption law was thrown out. But some of the officials apparently haven’t\r\nheard of the decision yet.\r\n\r\nThat is not so surprising, since the sheriff, who seldom finds\r\ntime to enforce the state laws, is busy applying the lash and\r\ncat-o’-nine-tails. Archaic Maryland law provides for whipping some\r\nclasses of prisoners, the sheriff acting in person.\r\n\r\nAmong other joints in the county is one called the Hilltop, in\r\nHillside. It was formerly a barbecue pit, now is a snake pit--a noisy\r\nmadhouse catering to school and college kids who want to see what the\r\nwell-undressed peeler isn’t wearing. The Quonset Inn, also in Prince\r\nGeorges, is run by the Chinese syndicate of the District, which has\r\nestablished perfect harmony with the white bosses. You can see naked\r\nwomen at the Senate Inn, Waldrop’s, and occasionally at La Conga.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the temporary exodus of Prince Georges gamblers has\r\nstepped up wagering activities in other nearby Maryland counties.\r\nMontgomery, mainly residential, with swank Chevy Chase and hard-working\r\nmiddle-class Silver Spring, woke up to find its Elks’ Club the victim\r\nof a police raid.\r\n\r\nThen Sam Morgan, also of Silver Spring, described as one of the most\r\nimportant gamblers in the area, was locked up by State Troopers\r\nwhen they swooped down on “lay-off” establishments near Laurel Park\r\nand Ellicott City. These were nerve-centers for the transmission of\r\ncontraband money in and out of the District. Morgan drew a suspended\r\nsentence. No one ever goes to jail.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore Highway houses many tourist cabins, where pleasure-bound\r\nWashingtonians can drive and hire a room without baggage for $3, if not\r\nusing it all night. A big turnover is the gravy for these guesthouses.\r\nA few cabin resorts are reserved for Negroes only.\r\n\r\nThe Negro population of this part of Maryland is comparatively small,\r\nmost of its members doing menial or service labor for the white folk.\r\nHowever, the well-heeled boys of Washington’s colored set like to drive\r\nup the road a bit with their dusky dames in their Cadillacs.\r\n\r\nThe nearest amusement park to the city of Washington is Glen Echo,\r\nabout seven miles away, in Maryland. This is the typical smalltown\r\nConey Island, with swimming-pools, crazy rides, dancehalls, hot dogs\r\nand the inevitable pick-ups. Many professionals work the park in the\r\nsummer, but they are outnumbered by the forlorn femmes from Washington\r\nwho come there in pairs or even larger parties, looking and hoping.\r\n\r\n\r\n_B. Virginia_\r\n\r\nThe Virginia suburbs present a more respectable exterior, though under\r\nthe surface there’s plenty going on. The policy of the Old Dominion is\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nVirginia’s laws do not permit the sale of hard liquor for on-premises\r\nconsumption. Only beer and wine may be drunk that way. Hard stuff\r\nmust be bought at liquor stores and taken out. This isn’t conducive to\r\nanything like gay night life. Virginians go into the District or up to\r\nMaryland if they want hi-jinks. Otherwise, most of their fun-making\r\ntakes place at house parties. There are a few dives. But the after-hour\r\n“bottle-clubs” which plague Washington are to be found in Virginia too.\r\nOne of these is the Commonwealth at South Pitt and Wolfe, in Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThe average resident of Virginia’s suburbs is financially a step or two\r\nabove his Maryland neighbors. There are more fine homes and estates on\r\nthis side of the river. The Negro problem is not so incendiary, because\r\nthis is Virginia, where Jim Crow is king by statute, and colored people\r\nlive in restricted areas and behave, or else. This is one of the\r\nreasons why the Negroes floated into the District, where they changed\r\nplaces with the whites, who overflowed back into Virginia. Remarkable\r\nwas Prince Georges 64-percent population increase in the decade; but\r\nArlington County, Virginia, had 125 percent.\r\n\r\nThe absence of night life in the nearby Virginia suburbs has been\r\nnoted. This minimizes prostitution. Gambling is an important industry,\r\nas it is all over the nation.\r\n\r\nVirginia authorities are disturbed by an influx of bookmakers and\r\npolicy-sellers, white and black, from the District. Recently a Negro\r\nwoman was arrested in Arlington with $3,000 in a paper bag, which was\r\npicked up that day in pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters--for numbers\r\nbets.\r\n\r\nSam Lano, who used to operate the Syndicate slot-machines in Prince\r\nGeorges, is president of the Arlington Music Corporation, which flooded\r\nthe county with pinball machines, many being used as gambling devices\r\nby local merchants. Lano came here from New York two years ago. Over\r\na year ago he was convicted in Marlborough Circuit Court for having\r\nthreatened a Prince Georges tavern-owner with prosecution on a bad\r\ncheck if he didn’t keep Lano’s machines in his place. He was sentenced\r\nto a year and his conviction was upheld by the Maryland Court of\r\nAppeals. So far, however, Lano hasn’t served one day in the cooler, and\r\nno effort was made to detain him when he transferred his operations\r\nto Virginia. The police of Bangor, Me., are looking for him for the\r\nremoval and concealment of mortgaged property.\r\n\r\nConsiderable moonshine liquor is available in the Virginia suburbs. It\r\ncomes from stills operated in the mountains in the western part of the\r\nstate, and from Georgia.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, you might compare this area to the best of Westchester,\r\nor Chicago’s North Shore outskirts, or Beverly Hills. That doesn’t mean\r\nthere isn’t plenty of dirt. It does mean it has to be something special\r\nbefore it hits print.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, considerable friction is developing as well-heeled\r\nnortherners flock in; a repetition of the carpetbag days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. UNCLE SAM: LANDLORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Washington’s largest segment--the federal domain. More than\r\n40 percent of the property in the District is owned by Uncle Sam.\r\n(Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands is said to be the largest private\r\nowner of real estate in the District. She owned the huge Westchester\r\napartments, but sold the property recently to Hilton.)\r\n\r\nThough not contiguous, it has an entity of its own. It is immune from\r\nlocal law. That is important, because some federal property oozes\r\nacross District borders, such as the Pentagon and the National Airport,\r\nboth on the Virginia side.\r\n\r\nTo complicate the confused problem of law enforcement, this federal\r\npotpourri has its own local police--not one force, but several. The\r\nCapitol Police have jurisdiction on the Capitol grounds and several\r\nblocks on either side, as far as the Washington Union station. The\r\nTerminal Police police that. The White House Police are the cops for\r\nthe Executive Mansion and surrounding areas. They are under supervision\r\nof the Secret Service, a branch of the Treasury. The Capitol cops are\r\nunder control of Congress itself. The terminal, owned by the railroads\r\nand the government, picks its own bulls.\r\n\r\nThe Park Police are part of the National Park Police, a division of the\r\nDepartment of the Interior. They are the law in the parks and squares,\r\non the boulevards, and on the road in Virginia leading to the Pentagon\r\nand the Airport.\r\n\r\nAll other government buildings are policed by the Public Buildings\r\nPolice, a Treasury unit. The National Airport, in Virginia, has exempt\r\nstatus. Its own cops not only patrol the grounds, but the main road.\r\nThe Pentagon, Arlington Cemetery and other military establishments in\r\nthe vicinity are under jurisdiction of the Armed Services Police.\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands are employed in this federal domain. Many more\r\nuse its facilities or live in its lee. This makes the task of policing\r\nalmost too complex to be figured out by any court.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, when there is a conflict of authority over the situs of a\r\ncrime, both jurisdictions fight for the right to arrest and try the\r\naccused. In the District it works the other way around. If it’s a\r\nborderline case, both sides duck.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you’re pinched for anything on or along the road\r\nleading to the National Airport there is a conflict between the\r\nNational Park Police, the Airport Police, the local Virginia Police,\r\nmunicipal and county police, and possibly, the MP’s. No one wants any\r\npart of it. So there is merry law-breaking in this federal domain.\r\n\r\nAt this writing, 27,000 people are employed in the Pentagon. It is\r\na city within a city. Like all cities, it has its peccadillos. Many\r\nelevator operators are runners for bookies. Many colored messengers,\r\nmale and female, sell policy slips. Reefers can be had. The cops--all\r\nkinds--don’t know what to do about it. The military police don’t like\r\nto arrest civilians, even those employed by the Army. The Virginia\r\npolice say they have no authority because it’s federal property.\r\n\r\nThe same apathy that marks everything in Washington pervades the\r\nPentagon and other federal buildings. A high Army officer, highly\r\nplaced because his brother is close to the President, is a homosexual.\r\nHe had gathered 95 other officers of similar inclinations to form what\r\nwas known as the “Fairy Brigade.” Though scandalously abnormal acts\r\nhave been committed within the Pentagon walls, no consequences ensued.\r\nNo one knew how to go about it. Instead, the suspected fairies were\r\ntransferred to distant posts--separately, of course--in the hope that\r\nwhen they got into trouble in their new stations their commanding\r\nofficers would pick up the buck.\r\n\r\nMore recently a Signal Corps captain in the Pentagon was apprehended\r\nlurking in the stair wells, where he exposed himself to young women.\r\nThe Army took the easiest way--transferred him to Fort Monmouth, where\r\nhe was eventually chased out of the service.\r\n\r\nThe same situation applies in all government buildings in the District\r\nand in the suburbs. No one wants to do anything about anything. There\r\nis scarcely a government installation anywhere in Washington where\r\nyou can’t place a bet or buy a numbers slip. When elevator jockeys\r\naren’t selling them, clerks and typists, white and dark, are. Dates and\r\nassignations are made on U. S. property by government girls looking for\r\nfun or extra earnings, and by come-getters who barge in and solicit men\r\nfor dates after work--even sometimes for affairs right on overstuffed\r\nleather couches which we own, you too.\r\n\r\nAny punitive action in these cases is not by police officers. When\r\nthings get out of hand, department heads fire the culprits.\r\n\r\nWhile the Kefauver Committee was investigating bookmaking, two elevator\r\noperators in the Senate Office Building, in which the hearings were\r\nconducted, were taking bets on horses with full knowledge of most\r\nSenators, many of whom were placing wagers.\r\n\r\nThat guy you see at the corner of 1st and B, outside the House Office\r\nBuilding, talking to a cop, is a bookmaker’s runner. That’s his\r\nstation. That’s where typists, messengers and other help in the House\r\nof Representatives lay it on the line.\r\n\r\nMany have fallen into debt because of the convenience with which\r\nthey can place bets all day. Hundreds are in the clutches of the\r\nloan-sharks in Maryland and the shylocks, who work their trade right\r\nin the government office buildings, exacting 100 percent interest for\r\na one-month loan. Many are in arrears on their income taxes for this\r\nreason; those who owe more than what is withheld. This has posed a\r\nserious problem for the collecting authorities, who are balked by a\r\nquirk in the law which forbids them to garnishee tax delinquents among\r\nfederal employes.\r\n\r\nThe indifference to rules that apply in private employment results in a\r\nsort of Alice in Wonderland atmosphere throughout the unwieldy federal\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nHumorist George Dixon’s story about the two crews hard at work in the\r\nPentagon sums it up:\r\n\r\nOne crew puts up partitions. The other crew takes them down. The paths\r\nof the two crews seldom cross, though there have been embarrassing\r\noccasions when they arrived at the same office simultaneously on\r\nconflicting missions. But that was the fault of “inefficiency” higher\r\nup, not of the putters-up and the takers-down.\r\n\r\nRetired brass which had come roaring back to the Pentagon found itself\r\nassigned to broom-closets because many mere swivel-chair warmers had\r\ncommandeered enough office space for a bowling alley.\r\n\r\nThat’s why the Pentagon has two crews, working independently, day and\r\nnight. One makes offices bigger for new brass, the other makes them\r\nsmaller for the old.\r\n\r\nThe confusion is proving hard on fixed Pentagon employes. They suffer\r\nseverely from wet paint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE (_Confidential!_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. THERE’S NOTHING LIKE A DAME\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen are the same everywhere, except in Washington, where they not\r\nonly are different, but there are more of them.\r\n\r\nFemales generally fall into two categories, good and bad--the good\r\nbeing so because they can’t get the necessary masculine cooperation to\r\nbe bad.\r\n\r\nWe have seen them all, all over the world, but nowhere else are they\r\nlike they are in Washington. This town has 100,000 more nubile women\r\nthan men. Forty-five percent of all its females earn their own livings.\r\nMost of them are government employes, and thus have better security\r\nthan is provided by a husband. Many support husbands, or assist toward\r\nthe expenses of the mutual establishment. Being self-supporting, they\r\nare, on the average, better dressed than you’ll find them anywhere\r\nelse. That is on the “average.” There is little “high-fashion” except\r\nin diplomatic and social circles, because government salaries are\r\naverage, not high.\r\n\r\nMost Washington men are only fair wage earners, too, and that limits\r\nthe loot. It is not so easy to promote a mink coat in Washington as it\r\nis in New York, though there are more minks per corpus in Washington\r\nthan are won, wangled or plain bought in Philadelphia, Chicago or\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nOur capital is a femmocracy, a community in which the women not only\r\noutdo the men in numbers, but in importance. Males hold more exalted\r\npositions, but such work as is accomplished could not go on without\r\nthe efficient, well-trained and permanent secretarial corps, almost all\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\nEverything in Washington is slanted toward dames. The accent in the\r\nstores is on things women do or buy for themselves, instead of on\r\nhome-furnishing and children’s clothes, which are the bedrocks of\r\ndepartment store trade in other cities.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, femmes are divided into specific classes. They are wives,\r\nwhores, glamor girls, home girls and office workers. Here none matches\r\nher opposite number as you know her. The females in the capital defy\r\nclassification by other standards, and lap over into categories not\r\nlaid out by economic divisions or natural vicissitudes of physical\r\nappeal. Prim, bespectacled bachelor-girl secretaries enlist as $10\r\ncall girls after hours or on Saturdays and Sundays--not for the money,\r\nbut for adventure, substitution for romance. A friend of ours had to\r\nentertain visitors. He phoned for three call girls. When they arrived\r\nhe saw to his horror one was his secretary.\r\n\r\nWashington’s biggest she-group is made up of G-girls, government girls,\r\nwho will be taken apart in later paragraphs. Running a close second\r\nare O-girls, those who work for organizations, such as unions, charity\r\ngroups, scientific societies, trade and mercantile bodies, and those\r\nwho do the paper work for lobbies which maintain permanent offices here.\r\n\r\nWashington proves that the emancipation of women is baloney. See what\r\nhappens here. They have jobs and make as much as most men. They have\r\nthe freedom to live alone and like it, but they don’t. They have\r\nthe opportunity to do vital work, to carve out careers in the civil\r\nservice, as some do. But all, including most of the married ones, are\r\ndesperately unhappy. They are caught in the unreality of this huge\r\nfarce. It can’t be a home, it can’t be a place to live in and love,\r\nit’s just a rat race running the same course every day.\r\n\r\nTens of thousands of young and ambitious girls flock into Washington\r\nfrom every state, territory and dependency, and from foreign nations.\r\nThere are even two from Samoa, pretty Laida and Marion Kreuz, whose\r\nbrother, Peter Coleman, is a policeman in the House Office Bldg., and a\r\nnight law student. The mass migration is similar in number, but not in\r\npurpose, to that which occurs in New York and Hollywood and to a lesser\r\ndegree in Chicago and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe girls that come from the farms, the inland cities and the tributary\r\ntowns to the other great metropolises come with stardust in their\r\neyes. Having discovered that what they have is too good for the local\r\ncow-manicurists, soda jerks and grease station monkeys, they assume it\r\ncan be used to start them on the road to fame and fortune in the big\r\ncity. Most fail to find the golden pot at the end of the rainbow or\r\neven get anywhere near it in New York and Hollywood. The disappointed\r\nfall by the wayside or return home and marry the mailman.\r\n\r\nThe psychological urge which uproots girls from their native\r\nenvironments to come to Washington is the same, but its manifestations\r\nare different. The youngster who pulls strings to get a government job\r\nmay be, and quite often is, prettier than her neighbor who hitch-hiked\r\nto Broadway. But apparently she hasn’t the same confidence in her\r\ncharms as her brasher sister, so she goes to Washington instead.\r\n\r\nThe young ones who come to the capital to work for Uncle Sam are\r\non the whole better educated than kids who want to make careers in\r\nshow business. Most of them must have graduated from high school and\r\nbusiness school to get a government job. There are some among the\r\nchorines who stuck a toe in a college, but all they need for success\r\nis to know the difference between the right and left leg, and remember\r\nwhen not to cross them.\r\n\r\nNot all girls who come to Washington come to work for the\r\ngovernment. Not all are high school graduates. Washington draws more\r\nstreet-walkers, who are strictly out for business, than any other town.\r\nThey set out from the nearby hills of West Virginia, Maryland and the\r\nCarolinas, and they are purposeful as to their objectives. Many aren’t\r\nbad-looking. So the question again arises, why didn’t they go to New\r\nYork or Hollywood and try for bigger stakes where flexible morals pay\r\noff better and the field for a killing is bigger?\r\n\r\nThe answer again is--no confidence. They don’t feel important enough to\r\nmake good in the big league. They are afraid of the megapolis on the\r\nHudson. Washington has small-town ways and the whores are small-town\r\ngirls. Street-walking requires no influential connections, deals,\r\nfinancial backlogs, tests, skills. They step off a bus and can be in\r\nbusiness before they pass a crossing.\r\n\r\nThe general belief is that when girls leave home they dream of going on\r\nthe stage. Washington proves that many leave home just to get away from\r\nHome.\r\n\r\nThey have one commodity they can sell. And they don’t have to carry\r\nsamples in a briefcase. And they must go on the road for customers--too\r\nmany complications where they are well known, have families, church\r\nconnections, lovers or husbands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. G-GIRLS\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. Government Girls_\r\n\r\nAbout 200,000 women work five days a week for Uncle Sam. They come\r\nfrom every corner of the nation. And no matter how long they remain\r\nhere, few of them ever really live here. They sleep in various kinds of\r\nbarracks, rooming-houses, rundown hotels, board with retired married\r\nones, and in all constitute a class so large and so displaced that the\r\ncity cannot absorb them as it does working-women in other communities.\r\n\r\nThey are not all physically repellant, nor do they behave generally\r\nlike spinsters are supposed to. The deadly monotony of their routine\r\ntasks and their lonesome lives wears out their charm before it destroys\r\ntheir looks. They are a hard, efficient lot, doing men’s work, thinking\r\nlike men and sometimes driven to take the place of men--in the\r\nproscribed zones of desperate flings at love and sex. Lesbianism is\r\nscandalously rampant, frequently an acquired dislocation rather than a\r\npathological aberration.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the average G-girl revolves between routine grind and\r\nphysical frustration. She leaves her job at five. If she goes home, it\r\nis to her tiny room or apartment to heat her dinner out of tin cans and\r\nponder whether to wash her panties or write letters home, or get drunk.\r\n\r\nIt isn’t all wrapped up in the fact of the female overflow. Left-over\r\nwomen can learn to do with half their share of men. But strangely,\r\nwhere every guy ostensibly could take his pick and date alternately,\r\nit doesn’t work that way. The Washington male clerks and middle-class\r\nbureau employes largely avoid their opposite numbers. They, too, are\r\nhall-room habitués, and they fraternize by some unwritten rule with\r\nother men, usually normal men. Propinquity does not work its magic\r\nhere as the dominant factor in the mingling of the sexes.\r\n\r\nThousands of visitors and thousands of servicemen from nearby\r\ninstallations, most of them dame-hungry, don’t have to hunt; they are\r\nhunted. Not only that, but often they are paid, and seldom are they\r\nallowed to pick up checks without a struggle.\r\n\r\nOne of the sights of Washington is the outpouring of the janes at five\r\no’clock. Many of them dash for cocktail bars, where they compete with\r\nthe harlots, who violently resent them and call them “scabs.”\r\n\r\nA favorite after-work guzzle-and-grab spot is the Cafe of All Nations,\r\nin the Mayfair House, at 13th and F. Wise men in the mood are there\r\nawaiting the stampede--not only for pleasure, but for the gigolo’s\r\nmite. Men and women are paid the same for equal work. Therefore the\r\nincome is high for females and low for males as such things are usually\r\nadjusted. We gave the place a play at the right time and sat at a table\r\nwith a third man who had come with us. A waitress shuffled up to us,\r\nand in voice and manner characteristic of an old-timer doing a familiar\r\ntask, said, “The young ladies at the next table would like to buy you a\r\ndrink.” We nodded, the potables were delivered, our hosts raised their\r\nglasses, and soon they joined us. We had another round, and when we\r\ninsisted on taking the tab, not only for our drinks but theirs, too,\r\nthey left us; they knew we weren’t “regular.”\r\n\r\nA T-man in the course of a check turned up one instance where 12\r\nG-girls had banded together and were keeping one man, in an apartment\r\non Q Street.\r\n\r\nOf course, among hundreds of thousands there are thousands not so\r\nsituated. Many are beautiful, their intelligence is beyond the average,\r\nand even humdrum government work cannot make eunuchs of all men.\r\nDesirable girls quickly find that they get preferential receptions and\r\npromotions even in civil service examinations. There is a middle-aged\r\nwoman with a superior position in the General Accounting Office, who\r\nhas risen because she functions as the procurement officer for members\r\nof Congress and other dignitaries. The G-gals hear about her specialty,\r\nget in touch with her, and if they have appeal they find fun and get\r\nahead. Outstanding ones are sometimes invited to entertain legation\r\nattachés or visiting celebrities.\r\n\r\nSecond-class lobbyists, who cannot finance dazzlers in the top\r\nechelons, have lists of typists and file-clerks and secretaries who\r\nare happy to be taken out, or taken in, and are not prissy over how an\r\nevening winds up.\r\n\r\nBeyond these escapes from a circumscribed daily existence, there is\r\nnothing else. A couple of gals will walk the Mall on Sunday, hoping to\r\nget picked up; or they join a church, or go to one of the countless\r\ndances held during the winter season by state societies, where they\r\nfind everyone else as desolate as they are; or they scrimp and save all\r\nweek for a thrilling breakfast-lunch on Sunday at the Statler, where\r\nthey find to their dismay everyone else in the room is a government\r\ngirl, too, and stranded for company.\r\n\r\nMany secretaries of Senators, Congressmen and executives are their\r\noffice wives. All Congressmen’s offices contain sofas paid for by the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nThese females, when they arrive, usually have accents, idiosyncrasies\r\nand dress foibles peculiar to their regions of origin. They quickly\r\nfall into the common mold. This is not surprising to your authors, who\r\nfor years have been writing about Broadway showgirls. Within six months\r\nafter one leaves the farm to join the chorus, she has acquired a new\r\nveneer which covers all she brought with her. You can’t, in any one\r\nchorus-line, classify the girls, except by their current hair shades.\r\nThey are as uniform as if they wore uniforms.\r\n\r\nThe government is like a chorus; instead of 20 girls there are 200,000,\r\nand they all talk the same--mainly about favoritism shown to another\r\nby the immediate superior whom they accuse of sleeping with her. They\r\ndress the same--usually in suits. They eat the same--salads and dainty\r\ndesserts. They live the same--in spick and span tiny rooms, with\r\nintimate wash hung on the line in the bathroom, which does triple duty\r\nas a kitchenette. They drink the same--martinis.\r\n\r\nTheir sex-lives are remarkably alike, too. Some are afraid they will.\r\nOthers are afraid they won’t. And it all boils down to the same\r\nsustained jitters, but in different wrappers.\r\n\r\nThe G-girl is in an unnatural vacuum. She has no time-limits; her\r\nsentence is for life, usually. She isn’t home and she isn’t away. Her\r\nmarriage outlook is bleak. No family ties console her. She is more\r\noften wooed by women than by men.\r\n\r\nShe makes a mockery of the theory that a woman’s first instinct is for\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_B. Girls with Glamor_\r\n\r\nLet it not be surmised that government-girls are all the girls. There\r\nare wives and fiancées, college co-eds, a sprinkling of debutantes and\r\nother daughters of the rare society clans, smart saleswomen, even a few\r\npresentable sob-sisters.\r\n\r\nBut the true glamorette, as she is known on Broadway and Fifth Avenue,\r\nVine Street and Sunset Boulevard, and even in such remote oases of joy\r\nas Galveston, Texas, is virtually non-existent.\r\n\r\nChorines are but a memory of leg and lavender for the old inhabitants.\r\nExcept for a rare transitory line in a night club, there is no such\r\nthing. Occasionally an imported single or sister-act plays the\r\nvaudeville house. Some of the painted peelers who work in the suburban\r\ndives sleep in Washington hotels. A movie celeb popping in for\r\npublicity, to attend a birthday ball or be photographed smiling down on\r\nTruman from the top of a piano, is an event. If there are any gorgeous,\r\ndangerous, slinky spies, we didn’t find them. Judy Coplon, by the men\r\nwho specialize in the field, was called exceptionally lush for that\r\ntrade. So we stopped looking.\r\n\r\nThe indigenous flora shape up about as they do in Brooklyn, except that\r\nthey are better dressed and have less sooty complexions. They do not\r\ncome downtown in slacks. Sloppy galoshes are de trop. Most girls at 16\r\nappear and behave grown up.\r\n\r\nBut few can enter the accepted avenues where beauty may command a\r\nrespectable commercial return. In any ranking hierarchy of glamor the\r\nmodel comes first, having long since passed the chorus girl, because of\r\nthe more stable rewards and higher standards brought about by the great\r\nadvertising demands. Washington has little need for animated manikins.\r\nSome of the choicer shops employ them to demonstrate clothes. There is\r\nno extensive advertising field.\r\n\r\nThe most lucrative and the steadiest calls for models come from sources\r\nnot seeking those who might be employed in industrial cities for\r\nmodeling. They hook on as hostesses, guides, ushers, and to decorate\r\nthe booths and exhibits at conventions and trade shows, which are\r\nnumerous. Those who are engaged sporadically earn a minimum of five\r\ndollars an hour, plus indeterminate tips. Their morals vary with the\r\npersonal equation. The models who are willing to pose in the nude\r\nat stag-parties get fifty dollars an evening. These register with\r\nsurreptitious characters of the middle-world between flesh-market\r\nprocurers and shady promoters.\r\n\r\nAmong the better-known models’ agencies are Models Bureau, in the\r\nChastleton Hotel; Ralston, 711 14th Street, NW, and Phyllis Bell, 306\r\n13th Street NW.\r\n\r\nThe girl who sets out to be a model in Washington is usually one of\r\nthose rare creatures--the native. An out-of-towner with such ambitions\r\nwould naturally head to New York.\r\n\r\n(_Note_: Most model agencies are schools instead of employment\r\nagencies. They seek to sign job-seekers to contract to learn how to\r\nwalk, instead of sending them out to work. Some, billing themselves as\r\nagencies, provide girls--but not for modeling.)\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the shortage of really high class cheesecake is that\r\nthere is almost always a displacement movement in effect.\r\n\r\nThe trains and planes to Hollywood are loaded with lookers, sent there\r\nwith entree obtained for them by such influential VIP’s as cabinet\r\nofficers, four-star generals, bureau heads, etc. When a prominent daddy\r\ngets fed up with his dame, he can’t just brush her off; she might make\r\ntrouble, and that might get into print.\r\n\r\nSo the procedure is to phone Hollywood, where a liaison contact is\r\ninstructed to obtain a job at a studio for the chick. The big film\r\ncompanies employ scores of so-called “contract” gals at $150 a week or\r\nso, who do nothing but pose for publicity stills, date chosen visitors,\r\nlike out-of-town exhibitors, and otherwise make themselves useful and\r\namiable around the lots. One in a thousand rises and may become a star.\r\n\r\nThe movie industry is always skating on such thin ice, what with\r\nanti-trust laws, etc., that a request from Washington is a command. So\r\nit’s a happy out all around. Mr. Big gets rid of his discarded girl,\r\nshe goes willingly because no girl can turn down a film contract, and\r\nHollywood stores up a favor for the next time it needs one.\r\n\r\nMany girls with talent originated here but they scrammed as soon as\r\nthey were old enough to know better. Among them were Helen Hayes, Kate\r\nSmith and Mary Eaton, all members of the St. Patrick’s Players.\r\n\r\nWashington has no clubs or theatres with lines of girls. The best a\r\nbabe with light feet can do is get in as a teacher at a dance studio,\r\nquite a business in Washington. The local classified phone directory\r\nhas four pages of listings of dance instructors. That’s because dancing\r\nschools are a swell way for lonesome people to meet each other, and\r\nthat’s what Washington has plenty of. The local Arthur Murray licensee,\r\nacross the street from the Mayflower Hotel, is the largest Arthur\r\nMurray studio in the world. At least 2,000 girls find full or part-time\r\nemployment working as instructors in the dozens of studios. Many of\r\nthese girls are little more than taxi-dancers.\r\n\r\nPretty, personable ones can make up to $100 a week with tips. Those who\r\ntake dates after hours do even better.\r\n\r\nThe real Washington glamor girl is the kept woman. You’d be surprised\r\nhow many there are. All the bigger hotels and the glossier apartment\r\nhouses around Dupont Circle and out Connecticut Avenue are loaded with\r\nthem. They are the ones you most often see in mink coats, in expensive\r\nbeauty parlors and fine shops. They are maintained mainly by important\r\ngovernment officials, Senators, sports and millionaires from all\r\nover the country who make their headquarters in Washington. Many an\r\nexecutive who commutes to the capital keeps a cutie there full time.\r\n\r\nAll Washington giggled when it heard the story of the tall, stately\r\nblonde whose bills were paid by a Cuban sugar millionaire, and who fell\r\nin love with an assistant manager of the Shoreham Hotel, where she was\r\nliving in high style. Her Latin lover found her in flagrante delicto\r\nwith the hotel employe. The men squared off for a fist fight, but\r\nfirst locked the babe in a clothes closet. They blacked each other’s\r\neyes--but she fractured her ankle trying to kick the door down.\r\n\r\nTo add to the embarrassment of the unhappy Cuban, his wife had been\r\nspying on him and his love through high-powered binoculars from Rock\r\nCreek Park, across the street. She sued him for divorce in New York.\r\n\r\nA genuine glamor-gal does pop up now and then. One was Evelyn Knight,\r\nthe radio and record star, who warbled for $75 a week in Washington\r\nhotels until a couple of years ago, then clicked in Manhattan and is\r\nnow dragging down thousands.\r\n\r\nBette Woodruff, another home-grown dish, seems to be on the upgrade. A\r\ndress model, Bette had a yen to sing. One day, on a dare, she phoned\r\nmaestro Dick Williams to tell him she was available. He didn’t know\r\nher from Eve, took her name to shut her up. Next day his vocalist got\r\nsick. He phoned Bette in a hurry. That was less than a year ago. Now\r\nshe’s thrushing regularly, and well.\r\n\r\nBut Jan Du Mond, a five-foot-three night club canary, pianist and\r\ncomposer, drives a cab by day.\r\n\r\n“My little coupe broke down,” she told a reporter. “I couldn’t afford\r\na new car. Becoming a taxi-driver provided me with transportation at\r\nnight to get to my engagement--the company lets me take the car home.”\r\n\r\nBesides, she meets the most interesting people!\r\n\r\nSometimes a government gal switches to a glamor gal. One was Sandra\r\nStahl, “Miss Washington,” in last fall’s Atlantic City beauty contest.\r\nSandra was a secretary for Air Force Intelligence, but she has a face,\r\na figure, a noodle and a voice. She was the dark horse when she sang\r\nbefore 3,000 people in Rock Creek Park, but 14 judges, including the\r\nTreasurer of the United States, sent her to Atlantic City.\r\n\r\nSandra comes from Long Beach, California. In our “New York,\r\nConfidential,” we noted that many of Gotham’s orchids on display come\r\nfrom Southern California. Maybe Sandra got on the wrong train.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. COMPANY GIRLS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a specialty known only to Washington.\r\n\r\nWith the procuring situation as it is, the business of getting girls\r\nfor fun, friendship, or what have you in mind is so commercialized,\r\nit’s incredible.\r\n\r\nIn our excursions into life in New York and Chicago, we found that\r\ngirls you pay for an evening can be divided into two classes:\r\nparty-girls and call-girls.\r\n\r\nYou summon the former, but they are not necessarily whores. You whistle\r\nfor the others only when there’s to be a party.\r\n\r\nIf this seems contradictory, it’s because the dividing line is so\r\ntenuous, it usually isn’t there. But for our purposes, we shall group\r\nthem together and call both “C-girls,” which stands for company girls,\r\nwhich is just what the womanless men who call them want them to be.\r\n\r\nThere are as many kinds of C-girls as there are kinds of women. They\r\nrange from the lowest, who will come to your room for $5 for a quickie,\r\nto the most ultra, who expects $100, plus expenses, as a fee for her\r\ncompany for an evening, and nothing guaranteed. If it happens, it must\r\nbe romanced or financed with honorarium.\r\n\r\nThe C-girls include the cheapest cocottes and some of the smartest,\r\nprettiest New York models. The only thing they have in common is you\r\ncan phone them or someone who acts as an agent to make a deal, sight\r\nunseen, for their presence. The more they get the less they give. The\r\ntrue party-pretty undertakes only to appear for the evening, maybe\r\nentertain an important customer or that Congressman who’s going to\r\ninvestigate you or that general who places the orders. The call-dames\r\nare cheaper and more reliable.\r\n\r\nThey are available from all hotel bell-boys. A friend who lives\r\nin Washington said they weren’t necessary, for you can find a\r\nstreet-walker on any avenue or a hustler at almost any bar. We asked\r\nhow about the transient, who doesn’t know that, so doesn’t know\r\nwhere to look, or is afraid. The bell-captain, who can get anything,\r\nincluding booze after hours, is the functionary out-of-towners over the\r\nage of puberty call. Using his services also means no raid from the\r\nhotel dick, who is an ally.\r\n\r\nLobbyists have lists of company-girls whose services they utilize as\r\nrequired. They exchange names with each other, so most of them have\r\na master-list. In addition, there are agents, quite often apparently\r\nrespectable, middle-aged women, who run “secretarial bureaus” that\r\nsupply company-girls, often do contract businesses with large users,\r\nwhom they bill by the year.\r\n\r\nThe secretarial bureau is important in the blind date business in\r\nWashington. Without much trouble, you can get the kind of girl you want\r\nby calling almost any of them. The procedure is this: You phone for\r\na stenographer to be sent to your hotel room. She, however, is never\r\nthe “date.” After giving her a nominal amount of dictation, you remark\r\nyou are alone and friendless. She tells you one of her girl friends is\r\nlonesome, too, and would consider a date. You wait in. She arrives.\r\n\r\nA problem for those who must entertain men of class is the low quality\r\nof the female commodity obtainable except from specializing agencies.\r\nGovernment gals, many of whom are on call, are superior intellectually,\r\nhave better manners, though the professional predators run prettier.\r\nWith the short supply of charmers, those who maintain a superior\r\nstandard import them. Many big lobbyists and others who entertain\r\nfrequently have lists of New York models and showgirls who will come\r\ndown to Washington for fun, expense money, and maybe a mink.\r\n\r\nThere is a middle-aged woman in New York, who gives her name as Mrs.\r\nHansen, who makes regular monthly trips to such Eastern cities as\r\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore and Washington, where she meets prominent\r\nbusinessmen and offers to introduce them, at a fee of $10 each, to\r\nany of a hundred Powers and Conover models whose photos she has in\r\na scrapbook and whose names she has on a typewritten sheet. She\r\nguarantees to produce any girl thereon in Washington within 24 hours,\r\nthe girls to receive $100 and expenses for each day’s company.\r\n\r\nBut that is still run-of-the-mill. A babe named Teddie, with an\r\napartment in the building on the southwest corner of 16th Street, in\r\nthe 1600 block, handles knockouts, some married, for as much as $250 a\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nVirginia Wall, who lives at 2500 Q Street (phone Hudson 8783) at this\r\nwriting, was chosen by those who know her as--“the most promising\r\nyounger company-girl in Washington.” She knows many other company girls.\r\n\r\nFlorence Bowers, a Southerner who lives at 1716 Newton St., phone\r\nHobart 5634, is a well-known company girl who will get others when\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Morley, 2124 P St., phone Hobart 7421, will get company-girls.\r\n\r\nMary Lou Vane, 1205 Clifton St., NW, is a superior company girl.\r\n\r\nWashington has its corned beef and cabbage, but don’t say we don’t\r\nbring out its caviar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. FOR IMMORAL PURPOSES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may startle you, though not necessarily stop you, to know what very\r\nfew know--it is a felony to transport a female one step up or down or\r\nsideways in the District of Columbia with what grandma used to call\r\n“dishonorable intentions.”\r\n\r\nThe Mann Act was invented by a Chicago blue-nosed representative named\r\nMann, after a hophead parlor-whore in melodramatic mood threw a note\r\nout of the window of the late Harry Guzik’s cathouse on which she had\r\nwritten “I am a white slave.” A milkman found it and turned it in at\r\nthe 22nd Street police station. A puritanical young prosecutor named\r\nClifford Roe, instead of laughing, made it so scandalous that the\r\nterm “white slave” became the common synonym for a prostitute. Mona\r\nMarshall, the girl, was no slave at all, and when she came out of her\r\nfog she proved it. Her case history showed that she had been seduced\r\nin Wisconsin and brought to Chicago and placed in the house, quite\r\nwillingly, by a traveling man who thought it was wasteful to give it\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThat came out in testimony and Congressman Mann fathered the law making\r\ninterstate transportation a penitentiary offense. Too many jokes about\r\ncrossing state lines have gone into the legend since then for anyone\r\nnot to understand the possible consequences of taking ’em in one state\r\nand making ’em in another. But what has been very sparsely advertised\r\nis a phrase in the Mann Act which states, “or on federal territory.”\r\nWashington is federal territory.\r\n\r\nSo, if you meet one in the lobby and take her up in the elevator,\r\nyou’re a candidate for Atlanta.\r\n\r\nThis clause has been enforced with ultimate results. But for many\r\nyears, by unwritten policy, the Department of Justice stopped paying\r\nattention to private, non-commercial infractions. But in no way has the\r\nletter been ameliorated, and at any time this statute could be applied,\r\nas the income tax evasion law was used to convict murderous gangsters,\r\nif an Attorney General so instructs. It can be used without even the\r\ntechnical provisions required to substantiate an attempted rape. The\r\nlanguage states, “for immoral purposes.” Such purposes need not be\r\nsuccessful. There is a mistaken notion that paying a female’s fare has\r\nsomething to do with it. It has not, except as evidence of the intent,\r\nwhich is the res gestae.\r\n\r\nLet it not be assumed that this is a major deterrent for the Washington\r\nwolf, before whom is spread a field alabaster with white lambs\r\ngenerously interlarded with black sheep. Yet the fine art of subtle,\r\nsophisticated flirtation, with skill, poise and aplomb, which has\r\nilluminated the finest works of the masters through the ages in every\r\nform of expression, seems extinct here.\r\n\r\nThose in residence are boors; the transients are in a hurry; and the\r\ndistaff defense being negligible, no true swordsman deigns to fence\r\nwhen he can hit a broad on the head with the handle.\r\n\r\nChief among Washington ladies’ men is handsome Warren Magnuson,\r\nbachelor Senator from the state of Washington, where some of his I.W.W.\r\nconstituents would probably kick over the traces if they saw the\r\nhighfalutin’ fillies he runs with in Washington. The Senator is a man\r\namong men, with the reputation of seldom wooing one girl at a time. He\r\noften entertains several in one evening in his Shoreham apartment. We\r\nknow. They talk.\r\n\r\nNot all wolves are single. We will not divulge names, or tell how\r\nthey cover up. Your imagination will picture how easy it is in a town\r\nwhere so many are seeking favors, to get a stooge to come along as the\r\ncutie’s alleged “date,” while the principal apparently came along only\r\nfor the ride.\r\n\r\nNot all wolves, of course, are Senators or such with official immunity.\r\n\r\nA simple way to get acquainted is to watch the papers for announcements\r\nof State Society dances. Most lonesome G-gals belong to these\r\nsocieties, composed of expatriates from their home states. Once every\r\nweek, throughout the year, one of these groups throws a party or a\r\ndance. Admission is open to all. The Officers’ Service Club dances are\r\nswell, too.\r\n\r\nAt this writing there are no public ballrooms of the type of Roseland\r\nin New York or the Aragon in Chicago, not because they’re illegal,\r\nbut because they have been unprofitable. In the summer this lack is\r\nfilled by moonlight cruises of the Wilson Steamship Line on the river.\r\nThe boats leave from the 7th Street wharf nightly, at 8:30, and the\r\ncharge, including dancing, is one buck. Plenty of unattached women go.\r\n\r\nThe Potomac is mighty important to wolves. Practically the last of the\r\nnight-boats in the country plies from Washington to Old Point Comfort\r\nand Norfolk, Virginia, summer and winter.\r\n\r\nIn years gone by, the fabled Albany and Fall River boats to Boston\r\ncould have told such stories.\r\n\r\nSteamers of the Old Bay Line charge $4.67 each way, with staterooms at\r\nfrom $1.50 to $5.50.\r\n\r\nLast fall, a couple of evangelists chartered a Wilson liner for an\r\nevening prayer service on the Potomac. Many pious people showed up, but\r\nso did a swarm of scarlet sisters.\r\n\r\nWith all the game flying low you’d scarcely think it worth while for\r\nentrepreneurs to promote stag-parties. Yet many hotel ballrooms are\r\nengaged for shows at which talent, imported from Baltimore, is seen and\r\nappropriately appreciated. These nude nymphs perform also at Waldrops\r\non Rhode Island Avenue, across the Maryland line.\r\n\r\nLots of smooth, mysterious guys in Washington, not pimps, make livings\r\nintroducing lonesome men to pretty babes. One, named Al Walters, ran\r\na series of dances called the “UN Victory Girls.” He was investigated\r\nby the Washington vice-squad, which found nothing illegal, though it\r\ndid determine that his net income from promoting these get-togethers\r\nwas $325 a week. Walters is still around town, always surrounded by\r\neight or ten pretty bimbos, usually blonde, and he can get to the right\r\npeople because he is a great introducer.\r\n\r\nYoung love gets a break in Washington, too, because the burg with its\r\nenvirons is small-town in construction, with front and back porches,\r\nlawns and alleys, and plenty of dark streets and nearby country nooks\r\nto drive to. Chief among the lovers’ lanes are Hains Point and the\r\nAnacostia Flats, along the Anacostia River, where the Bonus Army of\r\n’32 made camp. Not all who court Eros in these secluded spots are\r\njuveniles. Many adults take their occasionals there, especially white\r\nmen afraid or ashamed to check into free-for-all assignation houses.\r\n\r\nWe got the following story from a cop who worked the case. A\r\nblonde waitress at the Copacabana restaurant, a rendezvous for\r\nLatin-Americans, went with a stranger in his car to the Anacostia\r\nFlats. A woman’s screams tore the night air. Startled householders in\r\nthe vicinity, rape-conscious because of the front-page sex murder of\r\na girl the day before, phoned police. The squad car cops sped to a\r\nsurprised girl and an embarrassed gent. “I always scream at a time like\r\nthat,” she elucidated, with indignation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWISDOM OF A WASHINGTON WOLF\r\n\r\nWhen you see someone waiting for a bus or streetcar, it’s considered\r\npolite to offer a lift in your car. Washington gallants are very\r\npolite, especially if the hitch-hiker is cute.\r\n\r\n                       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe noticed Washington wolves seldom ply their dates with flowers. This\r\nmay be because the girls are so anxious they’d give the guy orchids. Or\r\nmaybe because Washington is an Eastern city, and in the East--New York\r\nespecially--few well-dressed women wear corsages.\r\n\r\n                       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMost G-gals start work early in the morning. The wise Washington lupo\r\nlearns to date them for cocktails at five in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n                       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome characters tap the female college alumnae lists for recent\r\ngraduates resident in Washington, then pick names at random and phone\r\nwith an invitation to a Yale or Princeton hop which never seems to come\r\noff.\r\n\r\n                       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOTELS FOR WOMEN ONLY: Hattie M. Strong Hall, (YWCA) phone ME 2100,\r\nMeridian Hill, CO 1000; All States (cooperatively owned) NA 2483. (If\r\nthe gal you’re phoning isn’t home, ask the switchboard operator if\r\nanyone else wants a date. She could know one.)\r\n\r\n                       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe abortion racket is wide open in Washington, with illegal\r\npractitioners protected from high-up. Prices run from $35 to $500 a\r\njob, depending on your color and your bank-book. The lowest charge is\r\nfor Negroes. Unmarried G-gals can get by for $75. Married women with\r\nhusbands who work are charged $100. Single ones in a jam who have rich\r\nor important paramours are nailed for as much as $500. (In New York\r\n$1,000 isn’t unusual.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. GARDEN OF PANSIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering where your wandering semi-boy is tonight, he’s\r\nprobably in Washington.\r\n\r\nThe good people shook their heads in disbelief with the revelation that\r\nmore than 90 twisted twerps in trousers had been swished out of the\r\nState Department. Fly commentators seized on it for gags about fags,\r\nwhimsy with overtones of Kinsey and the odor of lavender. We pursued\r\nthe subject and we found that there are at least 6,000 homosexuals on\r\nthe government payroll, most of them known, and these comprise only a\r\nfraction of the total of their kind in the city.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get authoritative data on fairies is from other\r\nfairies. They recognize each other by a fifth sense immediately,\r\nand they are intensely gregarious. One cannot snoop at every desk\r\nand count people who appear queer. Some are deceptive to the\r\nuninitiated. But they all know one another and they have a grapevine\r\nof intercommunication as swift and sure as that in a girls’ boarding\r\nschool. Since they have no use for women in the main, and are uneasy\r\nwith masculine men, they have a fierce urge, even beyond the call of\r\nthe physical, for each other’s society. They have their own hangouts,\r\nvisit one another, and cling together in a tight union of interests and\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nNot all are ashamed of the trick that nature played on them. They have\r\ntheir leaders, unabashed, who are proud queens and who revel in their\r\nrealm. Your reporters, after years around show business, are familiar\r\nwith those of their breed, unembarrassed in their presence. But, with\r\nthe exception of crude male prostitutes whom they have encountered\r\nin police courts and on the sidewalks of New York’s Lexington Avenue\r\nand in Harlem, they still had a whisper of an illusion left: they got\r\nthe idea, because they had met so many with marked talent, that by a\r\npathological compensation many of them possessed artistic traits.\r\n\r\nIn Washington they found this false. The exceptional ones do drift to\r\nBroadway and to Hollywood. But they are no more representative of\r\ntheir numbers than are the gifted men and women who find their places\r\nin the arts of the great mass of people from whom they become detached\r\nto follow the livelier professions.\r\n\r\nNow we have found out where the dull, dumb deviates go. We had assumed\r\nthat, as they grew up in small communities where they soon became\r\nobvious and odious, they took flight for the stage, the screen,\r\ninterior decorating, exotic literature and other fields centered in the\r\nmetropolitan market-places. That is not true. Only a few can and do\r\nenter the avenues where their talents make them equal, often superior.\r\n\r\nSo, what becomes of the marked twilight-sex, unwelcome at home, pariahs\r\nafar? We might ask what becomes of the club-footed or pock-marked girl\r\nsimilarly situated. She is in a panic about the present, still more\r\nso about the future, and she searches for security. Where can that be\r\ncaptured? Nowhere else as surely as in the civil service. There, in the\r\nmediocrity and virtual anonymity of commonplace tasks, the sexes--all\r\nfour of them--are equal in the robot requirements and qualifications.\r\nThere is no color line, no social selectivity; not even citizenship\r\nis always a prerequisite. Once the precious appointment is filed in a\r\nmachine which knows no discrimination, there it stays for life.\r\n\r\nLike immigrants from foreign lands, for these people are aliens in\r\ntheir own, they attract--more often send for and finance--those who\r\nspeak their language and live their kind of lives. Congressman A. L.\r\nMiller, of Nebraska, a physician, author of the District’s new bill\r\nto regulate the homos, enunciated with an oratorical flourish the\r\ndeathless statement that, “birds of a feather flock together.” William\r\nJennings Bryan came from Nebraska, too.\r\n\r\nThe 6,000 who made the perennial payroll drew many more thousands who\r\nflunked it. Like pug-nosed, freckle-faced girls of no distinction, who\r\nbecome waitresses and car-hops, these inverts who are washed in with\r\nthe tide and beached in the mud become clerks in shops, hairdressers,\r\nwaiters, bartenders, most often in the places habitually patronized by\r\nthose of their own stripe.\r\n\r\nThe Washington vice squad had listed 5,200 known deviates. Dr. Ben\r\nKarpen, psychiatrist at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, believes they are in\r\nthe tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nTheir chief meeting place is in leafy Lafayette Square, across\r\nPennsylvania Avenue from the White House. They make love under the\r\nequestrian statue of rugged Andrew Jackson, who must be whirling on his\r\nheavenly horse every time he sees what is going on around his monument.\r\nLafayette Square is no bohemian section, like Washington Square in\r\nNew York. The three sides not surrounded by the White House have such\r\nbuildings as the Cosmos Club, formerly the home of Dolly Madison; the\r\nnational headquarters of the League for Political Education of the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor; the Hay-Adams House, one of Washington’s\r\nfiner hotels, and other dignified structures.\r\n\r\nHow the fairies happened to pick this place for their rendezvous, and\r\nhow the cops let them get away with it, no one can trace.\r\n\r\nThe police keep making arrests, but it does not deter the homos from\r\nhanging out around the square. They make pick-ups there and quite often\r\nengage in immoral acts practically under the eyes of the sparrow cops.\r\n\r\nThey also foregather in Franklin Park, a few blocks away, in the center\r\nof the business district.\r\n\r\nThere is no geographic section where degenerates generally live. That\r\nis part of the general picture, everything, everywhere, in Washington.\r\n\r\nMany rich fairies and lesbians live in expensive remodeled Georgetown\r\nhomes, the nearest thing to a left-bank neighborhood. This is also a\r\nleft-wing center.\r\n\r\nSome parties which take place in Washington pervert sets are orgies\r\nbeyond description and imagination. Every invention of Sacher-Masoch\r\nand the Marquis de Sade has been added to and improved upon, and is in\r\ndaily use. Weekends find the pansies and lady-lovers on broad, baronial\r\nestates of wealthy perverts in nearby Virginia and Maryland. Many of\r\nthe third sex journey regularly to New York, where they have friends in\r\nesoteric circles.\r\n\r\nWashington has its transvestites, who get their thrills from appearing\r\nin the clothes of the opposite sex. Some of the ritzier dress shops on\r\nConnecticut Avenue couldn’t exist if it weren’t for the fairies who buy\r\nFrench imports. Many dress in drag on Thanksgiving Day and mingle in\r\nthe holiday crowds with the costumed young folk.\r\n\r\nWhile these lines were being typed, a member of the staff of Democratic\r\nSenator Edwin C. Johnson, of Colorado, who recently made front pages\r\nwhen he attacked the morals of the movie industry, was arrested\r\nby two vice squad officers in the men’s room in Lafayette Square\r\nand charged with committing indecent acts. Booked in $500 bail, he\r\npleaded not guilty. He and Senator Johnson, who appeared with him in\r\nthe preliminary hearing before the United States Attorney, made no\r\nstatements. He was later acquitted by a jury.\r\n\r\nThe same day, Assistant U. S. Attorney Warren Wilson asked for the\r\nnight closing of public comfort stations, calling them breeding places\r\nof perversion. Commenting on the increase of such cases, Wilson said,\r\n“90 percent of these offenses are committed in men’s rooms operated by\r\nthe Federal government.”\r\n\r\nWilson mentioned Lafayette Square, Stanton Park, Dupont Circle and\r\nFranklin Park. He recommended that all these comfort stations be closed\r\nas soon after 4 P.M. as policemen on the 4–12 shift could do so, and be\r\nkept closed until 8 A.M.\r\n\r\n“These stations were constructed when there were no other facilities\r\nin downtown Washington,” Wilson said. “Today, hundreds of restaurants\r\nare required to have toilet facilities by law. Many hotels have been\r\nconstructed since the comfort stations.\r\n\r\n“Public places are becoming cesspools of perversion.”\r\n\r\nMany cocktail lounges and restaurants cater to irregulars. Most of them\r\nare near the Mayflower Hotel. The most popular resort is the Jewel Box,\r\nnear 16th and L, NW, formerly known as the Maystat. It is a cocktail\r\nlounge with entertainment by a piano-player, who sings semi-risqué\r\nlyrics.\r\n\r\nThe waiters are obviously fairies. Most customers seem to fit into the\r\npattern. The night we went there, a police car, with siren screaming,\r\npulled up. We figured it was a pinch. After the cop threw out two\r\ncustomers, a waiter told us everything was o.k.\r\n\r\n“Those boys got fresh,” he said. “They tried to flirt with those two\r\nwomen sitting there. We don’t tolerate flirting--anyway not with women.”\r\n\r\nThen he minced off, hand on hip.\r\n\r\nFags also like a restaurant known as Mickey’s, behind the Mayflower.\r\nThey patronize the second floor of a place in the 1700 block of H\r\nStreet. One night two Congressmen, a couple of army officers, and two\r\nyoung servicemen were mixing beer and gin there, and kissing each\r\nother. They also swish around the Sand Bar in Thomas Circle.\r\n\r\nA favorite meeting-place for keeping appointments is the lobby of the\r\nFranklin Park Hotel. The Riggs Turkish Bath, the only one in town,\r\nunder Keith’s Theatre, was closed up because these undesirables took it\r\nover. Its license has since been restored.\r\n\r\nBlack Washington has its share of deviates, too.\r\n\r\nThere is free crossing of racial lines among fairies and lesbians. We\r\nhave seen aristocratic Southerners, on the bias, hunt down Negro men\r\nfor dalliance. We bumped into a gal in show business, who we know is\r\nqueer, sitting with two mannish-looking women at the Jewel Box. She\r\ninvited us to a party in Black Town, an inter-racial, inter-middle-sex\r\nmélange, with long-haired, made-up Negro and white boys simpering while\r\nfemales of both races mingled in unmistakable exaltation.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer, groups of colored fairies make up “yachting” parties\r\nand cruise the Potomac on the steamer Robert E. Lee. One Saturday\r\nnight, last summer, over 100 cops were dispatched to the docks when the\r\n“Society of Female Impersonators” was to have a midnight sail. They\r\nfound 1,700 Negro men, all dressed as women, on the boat, and as many\r\nmore trying to get on. A riot was in the making, but the cops busted it\r\nup and kept it quiet when they hauled away two wagon-loads. The ship\r\nfinally got off at 2 A.M.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, in another melee on the same boat, a colored man was\r\nfatally shot by a police detective after he jumped into the water.\r\nAnother Negro, who pleaded guilty to having started the riot, was fined\r\n$200 for having endangered the lives of 600 persons. Some months later,\r\nWashingtonians were mystified by an ad in a daily paper which read as\r\nfollows: “S.S. Mt. Vernon--moonlight cruise--8:30 P.M.--beer--stag or\r\ndrag.”\r\n\r\nNo one knows how many lesbians there are, because the female--or is it\r\nmale--of the pervert species is seldom spoken about and is much less\r\nobvious. Psychiatrists and sociologists who have made a study of the\r\nproblem in Washington think there are at least twice as many Sapphic\r\nlovers as fairies. A large incidence of lesbianism is concomitant with\r\nthe shortage of men, where women work together, live together, play\r\ntogether, so love together.\r\n\r\nSome display themselves, strut around in fairy joints; all queers are\r\nin rapport with all others. You will see them also in some of the late\r\nbottle-clubs, on the make for the same girls the he-wolves are chasing.\r\n\r\nThe mannish women used to hang out at the Show Boat Bar, H and 13th,\r\nuntil the management drove them out. Now in David’s Grill, formerly the\r\nHorseshoe, in back of the Mayflower Hotel, they outnumber the pansies\r\nwho haunted the place. Many lesbians frequent Kavakos’ Grill, in the SE\r\nsection, though this is not any joint so specializing. The club, owned\r\nby Bill Kavakos, a rich Greek who likes to gamble, is near the Navy\r\nYard. It caters to sailors and slummers.\r\n\r\nA breakdown of occupations in one group of 543 perverts who were\r\narrested showed some interesting sidelights. Among them was only one\r\nactor, but 92 students. There were 58 army personnel and 28 from the\r\nnavy. Even the rugged Marines appeared. Among the deviates were one\r\nbartender, one barber and one baker. There were four attorneys, only\r\ntwo doctors and only one embalmer. This is the record:\r\n\r\n  Accountant                             7\r\n  Actor                                  1\r\n  Airport employee                       3\r\n  Army:\r\n      Commissioned                       9\r\n      Noncommissioned                   49\r\n  Attorney                               4\r\n  Baker                                  1\r\n  Barber                                 1\r\n  Bartender                              1\r\n  Businessman                            7\r\n  Butcher                                1\r\n  Cab driver                             2\r\n  Clerk                                 48\r\n  Diplomat                               1\r\n  Doctor                                 2\r\n  Embalmer                               1\r\n  Embassy personnel                      1\r\n  Government employee                   57\r\n  Guard                                  9\r\n  Historian                              1\r\n  Horse breeder                          1\r\n  Interior decorator                     3\r\n  Jeweler                                1\r\n  Laundryman                             6\r\n  Librarian                              3\r\n  Marines, U. S.                         2\r\n  Minister                               3\r\n  Musician                               5\r\n  Navy:\r\n      Commissioned                       1\r\n      Noncommissioned                   27\r\n  Page boy                               1\r\n  Pharmacist                             4\r\n  Porter                                 6\r\n  Radio personnel                        3\r\n  Realtor                                2\r\n  Reporter                               2\r\n  Restaurant personnel                  27\r\n  Salesman                              10\r\n  Sculptor                               2\r\n  Servant                               10\r\n  Service-station operator               2\r\n  Skilled laborer                       17\r\n  Stenographer and secretary             4\r\n  Student                               92\r\n  Teacher and Professor                 12\r\n  Technician                             3\r\n  Unemployed                            50\r\n  Unskilled laborer                     31\r\n  Writer                                 2\r\n                                       ---\r\n      Total                            543\r\n\r\nWith more than 6,000 fairies in government offices, you may be\r\nconcerned about the security of the country. Fairies are no more\r\ndisloyal than the normal. But homosexuals are vulnerable, they can\r\nbe blackmailed or influenced by sex more deeply than conventional\r\ncitizens; they are far more intense about their love-life.\r\n\r\nForeign chancelleries long ago learned that homos were of value in\r\nespionage work. The German Roehm, and later Goering, established\r\ndivisions of such in the Foreign Office. That was aped by Soviet\r\nRussia, which has a flourishing desk now in Moscow. According to\r\nCongressman Miller, who made a comprehensive study of the subject,\r\nyoung students are indoctrinated and given a course in homosexuality,\r\nthen taught to infiltrate in perverted circles in other countries.\r\nCongressman Miller said:\r\n\r\n“These espionage agents have found it rather easy to send their\r\nhomosexuals here and contact their kind in sensitive departments of our\r\nGovernment. Blackmail and many other schemes are used to gather secret\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n“The homosexual is often a man of considerable intellect and ability.\r\nIt is found that the cycle of these individuals’ homosexual desires\r\nfollows the cycle closely patterned to the menstrual period of women.\r\nThere may be three or four days in each month that the homosexual’s\r\ninstincts break down and drive the individual into abnormal fields of\r\nsexual practice. Under large doses of sedatives during this sensitive\r\ncycle, he may escape such acts.\r\n\r\n“The problems of sexual maladjustments are urgent and still far from a\r\nsolution. In the Army, several thousand were discharged. When caught in\r\nthe act, they were generally discharged without honor, which means loss\r\nof citizenship. Many failed to survive rigors of warfare and intimate\r\nassociation with men. The majority were unable to conceal their\r\ntendencies and were eventually eliminated with disgrace.\r\n\r\n“Never is the bond which unites two friends such that the acquisition\r\nof a new friend by one is regarded angrily by the other; but quite\r\notherwise is the life among homosexuals. Here jealousy reigns supreme.\r\nMale homosexuals will not share their fairy with anybody.\r\n\r\n“The sexual attraction exercised by a male on another may be apparent\r\nin many ways. The homosexual will become excited by the mere presence\r\nof some man in a public place. They often approach that man, though he\r\nis a stranger. A taxi-driver finds fares making indiscreet advances.\r\nThe homosexual has no sensation in the presence of the most beautiful\r\nand seductive female. Her amorous advances may be repulsive.”\r\n\r\nUntil the recent purges in the State Department, there was a gag around\r\nWashington you had to speak with a British accent, wear a homburg hat,\r\nor have a queer quirk if you wanted to get by the guards at the door.\r\n\r\nOne high State Department official was a notorious homo who preferred\r\nyoung Negro boys. He was detected in a Pullman car of the Southern\r\nRailroad--on the funeral train to bury Speaker Bankhead, father of\r\nTallulah--making immoral advances to a porter. The story reached\r\nnewspaper offices, but before it could be printed the State Department\r\nsent out an urgent appeal to editors to “kill,” because it might\r\nimperil the war effort. When this official’s misdeeds were placed\r\nbefore President Roosevelt, it was said he refused to replace him\r\nbecause they both “wore the same school tie.” After resigning from the\r\ngovernment, this official almost died of exposure when a Negro farm\r\nhand, jealous because of his attention to another, slugged him.\r\n\r\nAware of the seriousness of the problem, the State Department has a\r\nhighly hush-hush Homosexual Bureau, manned by trained investigators and\r\nformer counter-espionage agents, whose duties are to ferret out pansies\r\nin Foggy Bottom.\r\n\r\nBut the department cannot free itself of boondoggling tendencies, for\r\nat the same time it retains a personable and intelligent young lady to\r\nprepare a treatise on homosexualism, the purpose being to see if it’s\r\npossible to cure or contain the deviates who remain on the roles. Her\r\nassignment requires her to visit faggot dives, observe the queers in\r\naction and ask them how they got that way.\r\n\r\nThe following will be denied, but whenever possible the YMCA is vetoing\r\nthe use of its facilities, especially the swimming pool, to all State\r\nDepartment employees, just to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nA man of almost cabinet rank in the Defense Department is also a\r\npervert, with bivalent tendencies, a two-way performer.\r\n\r\nThese are no isolated incidents. The government is honeycombed in high\r\nplaces with people you wouldn’t let in your garbage-wagons.\r\n\r\nDavid K. Eichler, a brilliant 37-year-old Harvard post-graduate who\r\nwas a top policy-maker in the State Department as Deputy Secretary\r\nGeneral of the Far Eastern Commission until a couple of months ago,\r\nwas arrested by Park Police on the Ellipse, charged with committing an\r\nunspeakable act with a Negro man. He put up $25 “forfeit,” a Washington\r\nvariation of bail cash, about which more in another chapter. The next\r\nday, at the hearing, the colored man pleaded guilty, but when Eichler\r\ndidn’t appear the judge told the prisoner he might change his plea,\r\ninasmuch as his co-defendant wasn’t there.\r\n\r\nThe black fairy said, “Never mind, judge. I had a good time.”\r\n\r\nShortly after his arrest, Eichler went on a vacation trip to the South.\r\nAfter learning about the pinch, security officials instituted a search\r\nfor him and summoned him back to Washington. Eichler admitted nothing,\r\nbut resigned his $9,000-a-year job. He wasn’t asked to stay.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Grand Jury voted a no-bill when Eugene\r\nDesvernine, 34, acting officer-in-charge of Caribbean affairs in the\r\nState Department, was arrested for an alleged sex offense against a\r\n13-year-old boy. Desvernine, suspended from the department after his\r\narrest in East Potomac Park, has been restored to duty.\r\n\r\nThe original charges against fairies in the State Department listed\r\nonly 91, but considerably more than a hundred have been discharged from\r\nit since. More are asked to withdraw. And there are believed to be\r\nhundreds not yet shown up.\r\n\r\nRepublicans who tried to get a special “pervert squad” formed were\r\nvoted down on straight party lines by Democrats, who found themselves\r\nhaving to protect strange bed-fellows. When you read of a fag being\r\nfired or quitting, don’t think Washington’s homosexual population\r\nis reduced that much. It isn’t. Odds are the discharged degenerate\r\nis shifted up on some other government payroll. At least eight were\r\ntransferred from the State Department to Agriculture. Hundreds of\r\nothers driven from one department minced into others.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1950, State said they were all gone. But on the first\r\nday of 1951, the Washington papers carried this brief item under the\r\nheading: “Two Men Face Sex Charges.”\r\n\r\n“Alan A. Wakefield, 26, State Department employe, was released under\r\n$300 bond pending a hearing on a disorderly conduct charge. Vice Squad\r\ndetectives arrested him in the men’s room of a downtown hotel.” He was\r\nsince convicted of disorderly conduct.\r\n\r\nDr. Kinsey wasn’t appalled by the 6,000 fags in government jobs.\r\nAccording to his calculations, 56,787 Federal workers are congenital\r\nhomosexuals. He includes 21 Congressmen and says 192 others are bad\r\nbehavior risks.\r\n\r\nWe still favor the two-party system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. THE LITTLE RED HERRINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe district headquarters of the Communist Party--the local setup, not\r\nthe Washington nest of the national outfit--is only a block away from\r\nthe doorway of the F.B.I., on 9th near F Street. So close is the line\r\nof battle drawn.\r\n\r\nThis Union Square of the District of Columbia is, appropriately, on\r\nSkid Row. It is the apparatus that recruits government employes. And\r\nsometimes 9th Street is more active and important than 16th Street--the\r\nWhite House. The District chairman is Roy H. Wood.\r\n\r\nThis book does not bandy the right or wrong of Communism. It accepts\r\nand proclaims it all wrong. But it will stay within its limitations of\r\ndiscussing Washington, the city. So it will conduct you mostly through\r\nthe muck where crawl the punks in the ranks.\r\n\r\nThe State Department boys call foreign Reds “Agrarian reformers.” We\r\ncall them cobras. The real story of the extent of their infiltration\r\ninto the government will never be told. Hundreds of files have been\r\nimpounded or destroyed, and their subjects cleared.\r\n\r\nThe following tale is no exception. It is, rather, the rule. One\r\nnight a mysterious informant called on Constantine Brown, brilliant\r\nand patriotic foreign news analyst of the _Washington Star_, with a\r\nphotostatic copy of an order from a Deputy Chief of Staff, directing\r\nthe Army to destroy the records on several thousand subversives.\r\n\r\nBrown hurried to the home of Senator Styles Bridges with the evidence.\r\nBy 9 A.M., Bridges had called the Military Affairs Committee together.\r\nAn hour later it met and phoned the offices of the Secretary of War\r\nwith an ultimatum not to destroy any orders. When the officer who had\r\nissued the order met with the committee, Bridges looked coldly at him\r\nand said, “I can forgive an officer who makes a mistake or loses a\r\nbattle, but an officer who betrays the security of his country ought to\r\nbe shot.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a similar order was given the Navy, but was not caught in\r\ntime to head off the destruction of the records. F.D.R. was President\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\nWe are hopeful these things will come to an end, but do not expect\r\ntoo much. That is because we know the C.I.A.--Central Intelligence\r\nAgency--is loaded with Commies at the lower level, with some seeping\r\nright up into the upper brackets.\r\n\r\nA bright spot, however, is the advancement to the position of ranking\r\nminority member of the House Un-American Activities Committee of Harold\r\nVelde, young ex-F.B.I. agent, now representing Abraham Lincoln’s old\r\nIllinois district in Congress. Velde, at 40, has been a G-man, a county\r\njudge, and is in his second term in the House. His training under\r\nJ. Edgar Hoover sets him up as a canny spy-catcher; his hatred of\r\nsubversives, left or right, will make him a brake on Commie-coddling.\r\nHis predecessor on the committee was California’s new Senator Nixon,\r\nwho nailed Alger Hiss, and in Congress, Senator Dirksen, who beat Scott\r\nLucas. The Senate’s own Red probing committee is also good news.\r\n\r\nYour authors delved into how the rank-and-file protectors and\r\ncomforters of Communists in Washington got that way. We know about the\r\nover-educated Harvard prodigies, recommended to key spots by Felix\r\nFrankfurter, but how does a $3,000-a-year file clerk in State, or\r\nDefense, meet Reds in the first place? By what means is he wooed and\r\nwon to betray his country? Jim Walters of the _Times-Herald_ exposed a\r\nlot. Here is more:\r\n\r\nRed spies came here as soon as Lenin and Trotsky pulled their\r\nsuccessful November coup in 1917. But not until the late Roosevelt\r\nhanded diplomatic recognition to the enemies of civilization in 1933,\r\ndid a sizeable apparatus begin to build openly in Washington. In the\r\nearly years of the New Deal it became fashionable to be “liberal,” to\r\nlove all radicals, including revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nThe government was overloaded with Reds, pinks, fellow-travelers,\r\nsocial planners, do-gooders, proletarians, boondogglers and Socialists.\r\nThe federal establishment is still up to its neck in conspirators and\r\ncollaborationists, despite a few publicized firings.\r\n\r\nLet’s take the case of this humble clerk who is seduced by Reds.\r\nSeduced is just that. We covered the modus operandi used by the Pervert\r\nSections of foreign chancelleries in the previous chapter. But not\r\nall government employes are homos or susceptible. The normal must be\r\nromanced with natural methods. Sex-starved government gals are enticed\r\nby smooth, suave, good-looking men. Meek male clerks, in soporific jobs\r\nat standardized sustenance-pay, are awakened with a sudden whiff of the\r\nesoteric when fast-working, trained good-lookers make a play for them.\r\nThese happenings are not cribbed from E. Phillips Oppenheim novels.\r\nThey are planned that way and they come off.\r\n\r\nWealthy left-wingers with mansions in Georgetown cooperate avidly.\r\nHumble government employes are invited to exotic, erotic parties. This\r\nsudden entrance into a world of wealth, taste, refinement, liquor and\r\nlibido is irresistible to hoi polloi.\r\n\r\nSmart Red undercover agents try to get a hold of some kind on their\r\nvictims, something insidious. Soviet agents press a systematic campaign\r\nto bring women employes of the State Department under their control by\r\nenticing them into acts of adultery and abnormality. Parties are staged\r\nin rich surroundings with pornographic exhibitions, unlimited liquor\r\nand every form of dope--and a hidden, talking moving picture camera\r\nrecording it all.\r\n\r\nAs many as 65 or 70 attend these aphrodisiac get-togethers, where many\r\nwear rich Oriental costumes and Arabian Nights music completes the\r\nintoxication of all the senses. Not only potential friends are thus\r\nwon and hooked, but dangerous foes are silenced. One gossip writer, a\r\nfeared crusader, has within the last couple of years become a virtual\r\ntransmission belt for the Communist line. He was called into a secret\r\nprojection room and shown a devastating film of his behavior at a\r\ndrunken, depraved orgy. We have seen “stills” from it.\r\n\r\nThis use of sex as a means of recruiting is a basic tactic. It has\r\nbeen developed to such an extent by the Reds, they now seek to\r\nconvert children thereby. Herbert J. Benjamin, long a key figure in\r\nthe Communist Party in the United States, was arrested recently by\r\nvice squad men for selling lewd pictures and literature to Washington\r\nchildren, and convicted of violation of the D.C. code.\r\n\r\nBenjamin, a former secretary of the International Workers Order, long\r\na contributor to party magazines and periodicals, was mentioned in a\r\nmemo by Earl Browder, November 27, 1939, as an alternate to the tenth\r\nconvention of a national Communist Party committee. Later he was the\r\norganization’s national press director and was in charge of the St.\r\nLouis office of a Communist political association. He and his wife\r\nlived in the Trenton Terrace apartments, on Mississippi Ave., SE, where\r\nother tenants were Rob Hall, Washington correspondent for the _Daily\r\nWorker_, and Joseph Forer, a veteran attorney for Reds. Benjamin’s wife\r\nwas manager of the apartment house.\r\n\r\nThe pinks are still working strenuously to grab off and bring up new\r\nfollowers from the incubator stage. As these lines were written,\r\nthree names listed by the District Board of Education as speakers for\r\nits in-service-training program were found to be also in the House\r\nCommittee on Un-American Activities’ files as left-wingers--Dr. Paul B.\r\nCornely, Freedmen’s Hospital medical director; Dr. Alice V. Keliher,\r\nof New York University; and Dr. Dora B. Smith, of the University of\r\nMinnesota. Superintendent of Schools Corning said, “The names were\r\nidentical with names in the House Un-American Committee records.” Since\r\nthen Red and Socialist-slanted text books have been found to be in use\r\nin Washington’s schools.\r\n\r\nUntil two years ago, there was considerable radical financial\r\ninterest in radio station WQQW. The stock has since been placed in a\r\nvoting-trust with a good American as trustee. For years this station\r\nrefused to sign off with “The Star-Spangled Banner.”\r\n\r\nThe Dupont Theatre specializes in interracial and foreign films, most\r\nof them slanted left. Danny Weitzman, owner of the building, was active\r\nin the Wallace presidential campaign.\r\n\r\nThe Reds and bleeding hearts play up their “love” for Negroes at every\r\nopportunity. This often pays off big dividends because so many colored\r\npeople are employed in government offices. A few Negroes are dumb\r\nenough to be misled by the Reds’ baloney about the brotherhood of man.\r\nBut to their eternal glory, the great mass of Negroes are among the\r\nmost patriotic citizens in the country. A few malcontents, who have\r\nbeen taken in by the crocodile tears of the Eleanor Roosevelt brand of\r\nreformer, occasionally indirectly render aid and comfort to the enemy.\r\n\r\nTo show how much they love the Negro, the white Communist brethren\r\nhold their District powwows at Shilo Baptist Church, a Negro house of\r\nworship in the NW section.\r\n\r\nIt is a Communist strategy to line Negroes into the party through white\r\ngals who, to show their complete compliance and condition of servitude,\r\nare urged to give themselves to colored men. Into this specialized\r\nservice they seem to wade with more than token application.\r\n\r\nMrs. Louise Branston Berman, millionaire radical who declines to\r\nstate if she’s a Communist on grounds of self-incrimination, spends\r\nmuch of her time in Washington. She uses her great wealth to help\r\nthe enrollment of left-wing recruits through social contacts. Louts\r\nwho never dined above a cafeteria before are invited to sumptuous\r\nbanquets in her homes in various parts of the country. Visiting Negro\r\ndignitaries who can’t get accommodations in hotels are her house\r\nguests. Mrs. Branston will learn for the first time here that when she\r\nput up the Negro singer, Paul Robeson, government agents had “bugs”\r\nin every room of her house from the parlor to the boudoir--she ought\r\nto hear the recordings. We did. They’re neither intellectual nor\r\nmusical--but they are illuminating.\r\n\r\nA principal Communist apparatus and recruiting ground for new Reds on\r\nthe lower levels was the late but unlamented UNRRA.\r\n\r\nThe organization was rotten with traitors during the time Mayor\r\nLaGuardia was its director. Either he didn’t know what was going on,\r\nbecause he attended meetings only a few times, or he didn’t care.\r\n\r\nWhen UNRRA was disbanded, its Red membership was moved almost en\r\nmasse to the payroll of the United Nations secretariat. Many are now\r\nstationed in New York, where they are sabotaging U.N. work as far as\r\nthey can. Others are attached to U.N. field offices in Washington.\r\n\r\nIf anyone doubts it was the policy of UNRRA to aid Communism and\r\nthat this had the approval of the present administration, which is\r\nbent on fighting Communism, let him read the following excerpts from\r\na memo which we filched from the UNRRA files. It is an inter-office\r\ncommunication, written in 1947, and addressed to Col. Katzin, a South\r\nAfrican, then an important UNRRA man and now top aide to Trygve Lie.\r\n\r\nIt follows: (The italics are ours.)\r\n\r\n“It should be made clear that _the administration, in pushing for\r\ndistribution to Communist areas_ and in requesting Edgerton to report\r\non such distribution, has in mind _actual shipments into Communist\r\nareas_ and not merely movements out of Shanghai with the expressed\r\nintention of making such shipments.”\r\n\r\nAnother paragraph reads, “In reference to Shanghai 6404, it is\r\ninteresting to note the U.K. position that _the program should be cut\r\nproportionately if the (Chinese) Nationalist government does not meet\r\nits obligations for Communist area distribution_.”\r\n\r\nIn other words, we strengthened the Chinese Reds so they could kill our\r\nboys three years later.\r\n\r\nAnother batch of Communists and Communist-lovers came into the U.N.\r\nthrough its International Child Fund. This department is loaded\r\nwith ex-State Department employes fired on suspicion of subversive\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nThat is a common habit. If all the homos, spies and other undesirables\r\nfired for cause were traced, hundreds would be found snugly ensconced\r\nin other bureaus, ostensibly screened, actually given screens of\r\nprotection and falsification by the radicals in high places.\r\n\r\nWe are not indicting Eleanor Roosevelt or Supreme Court Justice\r\nFrankfurter as Communists. Yet it is impossible to study the set-up of\r\nthe District of Columbia white collar Communist underground without\r\nfinding tie-lines from them to members of this group.\r\n\r\nThe man of mystery in Washington is wealthy, brilliant, daring Max\r\nLowenthal. He wrote the unwieldy book purporting to pulverize the\r\nF.B.I. which sold only 6,000 copies. Almost as many were given away.\r\nYet no one knows much about him. He is a shadowy figure who thrives\r\non obscurity, though he has filled public posts of importance. Until\r\nCongressman Dondero, of Michigan, investigated him, his name was\r\nobscure in Washington. Today not ten people in the government know\r\nmore about him than the fact that he is frequently more powerful than\r\nthe President and the Congress of the United States. This is some\r\nof what Congressman Dondero charged on the floor of the House of\r\nRepresentatives about Mr. Lowenthal whom he referred to as sinister and\r\nsurreptitious:\r\n\r\nLike the Communist Party, whose cause he has served so well, he\r\noperates on two levels. One is seemingly respectable; the other\r\ncompletely underground. He is native-born. His name does not appear in\r\nWho’s Who. To secure even a sketch of his biography has been a task.\r\n\r\nBorn in Minneapolis in 1888, like many other parlor pinks,\r\nfellow-travelers, Communists and convicted perjurers, he attended\r\nHarvard Law School. In those days he came under the influence of\r\nanother man who through the years has manipulated Charlie McCarthys in\r\nGovernment office. There is a striking kinship between the master,\r\nJustice Felix Frankfurter, and the pupil, Max Lowenthal.\r\n\r\nHe served as a secretary to Judge Julian M. Mack in New York, then\r\ninfiltrated the respectable law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.\r\nAfter a few years he founded his own firm, Lowenthal, Szold & Brandwen.\r\n\r\nLater he secured an appointment as Assistant Secretary of the\r\nPresident’s Mediation Board in 1917; in 1918 he was in the War\r\nDepartment; in 1920 he was an Assistant Secretary to the President’s\r\nIndustrial Conference. He became executive secretary for the Wickersham\r\nCommission on Law Enforcement, but when he found he could not run it\r\nhe resigned. He became research director of the Banking and Currency\r\nCommission, was on the staff of the Senate Committee on Interstate\r\nCommerce, also affiliated with the Board of Economic Welfare.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, known as general counsel to General Clay, he had as an\r\nassistant George Shaw Wheeler, the American traitor, Communist and\r\nrenegade who shocked all America when he denounced the land of his\r\nbirth and asked Communist-controlled Czechoslovakia for asylum.\r\n\r\nEvidence of his unswerving loyalty to Soviet Russia is clear and\r\nunequivocal. There is an interesting sidelight. The California\r\nauthorities raided the office of the Russian-American Industrial Corp.,\r\nwhose head, the late Sidney Hillman, had turned on Communism, but his\r\ngeneral counsel still follows the party line.\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the left-wing National Lawyers Guild, a member of\r\nthe National Committee of the International Juridical Association with\r\nLee Pressman.\r\n\r\nCarol Weiss King, who represented more Communists than any other\r\nlawyer, was a law clerk in Lowenthal’s office.\r\n\r\nLowenthal, living in New York, spent much of his time in Washington;\r\nhis influence is a menace to the best interests of America--so said\r\nCongressman Dondero.\r\n\r\nDon’t kid yourself. The Reds are not on the run in Washington. No\r\nCommunist control law means anything if the administration doesn’t want\r\nit enforced. The anemic Security Board appointed by the President to\r\napply the McCarran Act, loaded down as it is with left-wing apologists,\r\nis the tip-off.\r\n\r\nOne day after Senator Tydings, who became an ex because he\r\n“white-washed” Owen Lattimore, returned to private life he joined the\r\nlaw firm of his father-in-law, Joseph E. “Mission to Moscow” Davies. A\r\nsenior partner in that firm is Seth Richardson, appointed by Truman to\r\nhead the Security Board.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the rapid expansion of Federal employment has forced the\r\ngovernment to forego the usual pre-job loyalty checks of tens of\r\nthousands of new workers--hundreds of Communists are going on the\r\npayroll and will be there for months, possibly years, until their\r\nbackgrounds are delved into.\r\n\r\nWith a green light, the F.B.I. could break the back of the Communists’\r\nunderground. But J. Edgar Hoover cannot make policies. He is just a cop\r\nwho has to follow orders. At this writing the orders have not come. The\r\ntraitors in Washington are safe. On the other hand, those who testify\r\nagainst Reds are frequently harassed by Justice Department lawyers.\r\n\r\nIf this weren’t so ghastly serious, some phases of the great Communist\r\nspy-hunt would be laughable. For instance, there’s the story of\r\nthe prominent woman lawyer from New York, retained to represent a\r\nleft-winger about to be questioned by a Congressional committee. This\r\nCommunist kept his full status well hidden. He couldn’t afford to\r\nhire a lawyer who handled Communist cases. So this portly Portia was\r\nretained. She had no known Red connections.\r\n\r\nOn her way to Washington she stopped in Baltimore, to confer with\r\na well-known Communist counsel there, to be briefed. It began as a\r\nbusiness confab. They arranged a follow-up rendezvous in Washington.\r\nThe Baltimore attorney’s wife suspected him, followed him to Washington\r\nand caught him in the act with the lady lawyer from New York.\r\n\r\nThe wife sued for divorce. The co-respondent testified, admitted\r\nintercourse but denied adultery.\r\n\r\n“I was raped,” she cried.\r\n\r\nCross-examination:\r\n\r\nQ.--Did you have intimate relations with the defendant?\r\n\r\nA.--Yes.\r\n\r\nQ.--Did you consent?\r\n\r\nA.--Yes.\r\n\r\nQ.--Then how do you make that out rape?\r\n\r\nA.--I found out since that he is a damned Communist!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. KICKING THE GONG AROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be news that widespread addiction to narcotics is a\r\ncomparatively recent American manifestation. Long after the turn of\r\nthe century, a few trickles supplied pig-tailed Chinamen, despondent\r\nprostitutes, ex-cons who had picked up the habit in stir and a few\r\nrich fools who would try anything for a bang. Juvenile use was unheard\r\nof. Marijuana was unknown outside pad-parties in the Harlem jungles\r\nand among a thin fringe of Mexicans. The Harrison Narcotics Law, first\r\nfederal recognition of the existence of such an evil, is only 35 years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nWe are solemnly convinced that the great growth of this plague in the\r\npast 20 years has been parallel to the spread of Communism in our\r\ncountry. And it has not been confined to our country.\r\n\r\nEstimates by the Narcotic Control Section of the United Nations, that\r\none of every ten people on earth uses habit-forming drugs in some\r\nmanner or form, are borne out in this country, where the evil is\r\nprevalent in all sections. It is the greatest tangible menace facing\r\nus. And dope addiction, on the rise, can be traced definitely to Soviet\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a tactic of nations bound on enslaving others to\r\ndeaden the ambitions and energies of their victims with dope.\r\n\r\nExamples of this stretch back to the dawn of written history. In the\r\nlast century, British imperialists introduced the habit into China to\r\ncontrol that nation. Nazi Germany flooded Poland and Czechoslovakia.\r\nJapan built huge narcotics factories in Manchuria to weaken the\r\nChinese opposition. Russia is doing more of it now. Raw stuff pours\r\nin from Mediterranean ports. It originates in lands behind the\r\nIron Curtain. Its importation into the United States serves Russia\r\ntwofold--prostrates a prospective enemy and gets its hands on needed\r\nAmerican exchange to be used for propaganda purposes and payment of\r\nundercover agents here. International bank drafts could be traced.\r\n\r\nOne courier can carry $1,000,000 worth of uncut dope on his person.\r\n\r\nThere are many points of community interest between the Reds and that\r\nother great international conspiracy, the Mafia, which controls the\r\nsale of drugs in America. The Commies will team up with anyone who will\r\npromote civil disorder or do their dirty work. The Mafia is interested\r\nin making a dishonest dollar and will work with any partner.\r\n\r\nThe center of the narcotics industry in the United States is in the\r\ndistrict of former left-wing Congressman Vito Marcantonio, in East\r\nHarlem. During the days of his ascendancy, American Labor Party\r\ndistrict leaders were able to supply police protection through\r\nalliances with both Tammany Hall and anti-Tammany Mayor LaGuardia.\r\n\r\nGenerally untrumpeted was the fact that when the infamous Charles\r\n“Lucky” Luciano was ordered deported from Cuba, the titular head of the\r\nCuban Communist Party offered him sanctuary and appeared as his counsel.\r\n\r\nA study of the Congressional Record will show that most of the bills\r\nand measures designed to weaken the enforcement of the Narcotics Act\r\nhave been introduced by left-wingers and fellow-travelers. Many pink\r\nlawyers represent the underworld combine.\r\n\r\nOne of the most startling tieups was seen in the recent flooding\r\nof this country with cocaine. The Bureau of Narcotics had all but\r\neliminated this devastating drug. There had been none here for 20\r\nyears. Cocaine for American consumption comes from Peru, where the\r\ncoca leaves grow. A couple of years ago an Agrarian Communist group\r\ncalled the Apristas took over that country briefly. Seventeen cocaine\r\nfactories were constructed in Lima, eleven licensed by the local Red\r\ngovernment, and the others ran with the knowledge and connivance of\r\nthe authorities. Their entire produce was routed to the United States.\r\nCoincident with saturation of this country with cocaine, which sank in\r\nprice to as low as $1.50 a capsule, America went through its greatest\r\ncrime wave.\r\n\r\nWhen Commissioner Harry J. Anslinger traced the source of the deadly\r\nnarcotic to Peru, the New Deal State Department refused to intervene,\r\nas it was required to do by the international treaties which outlawed\r\nthe traffic. The reason for this failure, amounting to criminal\r\nnegligence, was that we could not interfere in Latin American affairs.\r\nThe cash for the cocaine was being used to foster Communism in South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nLast year the Reds were kicked out of Peru by what Washington pinkos\r\nstill refer to as “the oligarchy,” who immediately thereafter closed\r\nthe coke factories. Since then, this traffic has almost dried up in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nLikewise the administration has failed to inform the American public\r\nthat the Permanent Central Opium Board in Geneva, Switzerland, has\r\nbranded Soviet Russia and several Iron Curtain countries as palpable\r\nviolators of international treaties and UN conventions regarding the\r\ncontrol of narcotics.\r\n\r\nYou will probably learn here for the first time that the following\r\ngovernments, in addition to Russia, were named as treaty-violators for\r\nfailure to meet their obligations: Red China, Czechoslovakia and Poland.\r\n\r\nAmong others who failed to cooperate were Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Oman and\r\nLiberia, the African Negro republic in which Negro slavery is still\r\npracticed.\r\n\r\nNarcotic conditions in the capital are shameful. This is no fault\r\nof the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics, whose fighting chief, Commissioner\r\nAnslinger, is handcuffed by red tape, apathy and a penurious budget.\r\nThe Bureau has a personnel of less than 180 for office and field work\r\nthroughout the world. Its annual budget is less than $2,000,000. This\r\nis a drip in an ocean, yet Anslinger must cope with the deadliest evil\r\nknown to man, backed by a huge and wealthy underworld organization\r\ncontrolling tens of thousands of peddlers, sluggers and killers, and\r\nowning billions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThat the unsung agents of this Treasury bureau have done as well as\r\nthey have is a miracle. They could do better, especially in Washington,\r\nif they had the cooperation of the judiciary. They haven’t.\r\n\r\nYou can buy reefers on any corner in Black Town or in front of any\r\nhigh school in the District. You can purchase hard stuff at dozens of\r\ncorners, of which we can name many and will note some. This disgrace\r\nindicts judges in the courts of the District of Columbia. All are\r\nfederal, not elected, but appointed by the President. This goes for\r\nthe Municipal Court bench, which sits for six years, as well as the\r\nDistrict Court, appointed for life.\r\n\r\nEvery judge appointed in the last 18 years was put on the bench during\r\na Democratic administration. More than 95 per cent are Democrats. Few\r\nare Washingtonians. With few exceptions, these judges are divided\r\ninto two classes: Those representing the big-city bosses and gangs,\r\nand radicals named to appease bigger and redder radicals. The former,\r\nobviously, are expected to be lenient to law-breakers protected by the\r\norganized underworld. The latter, mostly fuzzy-minded intellectuals, do\r\nnot believe in punishment, especially when the evildoer is a Negro or\r\nof any minority race. They can’t find wrong in any man. They believe\r\ncriminals are mishandled wards of society.\r\n\r\nThe Washington field office of the Bureau of Narcotics--with only three\r\nor four agents--arrests dope peddlers as fast as they can be found and\r\nturns up enough evidence to secure convictions. But the courts almost\r\nuniformly issue suspended sentences or small fines.\r\n\r\nThe stench was so bad, dope peddlers were selling the contraband across\r\nthe street from the White House, at the eastern end of Lafayette\r\nSquare. The great brains regarded the venomous situation without\r\nqualms. What’s a little dope among dopes?\r\n\r\nIn desperation, Anslinger removed every agent--including one of his\r\nbest men, former agent-in-charge Roy Morrison--from the city of\r\nWashington. He felt it was needless to risk his men’s lives to get\r\nevidence against junk peddlers who were sure to keep out of jail\r\nbecause of a fix or muddle-headedness. Thereafter, for a short time,\r\nno effort was made to enforce the narcotics laws in the District.\r\nConditions got so bad, even the judges knew they must cooperate to\r\navoid a national blow-up. After Anslinger restored the agents, the\r\njudges began meting out stiff sentences. But the heat soon came off and\r\nthey are back at their old habits.\r\n\r\nAn example of what often happens when a dope peddler is arrested in the\r\nDistrict is the case of William Potts, indicted on 14 counts arising\r\nfrom the sale and possession of heroin. On the day set for trial, an\r\nessential witness of the government could not be found. The court was\r\nso informed. The judge turned to the counsel for defense and asked if\r\nhe was ready for the trial. Defense counsel was, but the U.S. Attorney\r\nsaid he was not, because of the witness’s absence. Thereupon the court\r\nasked if the defendant would waive a jury trial. He did. Immediately\r\nand without the pretense of trial, the court ruled. “I find the\r\ndefendant not guilty.”\r\n\r\nWilliam P. Estoffery came into court with a record of ten specific\r\nnarcotics convictions, but the United States District Court gave him\r\neight months to three years, which meant he could be back on the street\r\nin three months. One of his previous convictions was for possession of\r\ncounterfeit prescription blanks.\r\n\r\nHere is another sample of the judicial road-blocks erected against\r\nenforcement officers who arrest dope peddlers in the capital:\r\n\r\nConstitutional rights to privacy also give a defendant protection from\r\nillegal police raids on homes other than his own, the U.S. Court of\r\nAppeals for the District of Columbia ruled recently.\r\n\r\nThe court made the ruling in reversing the conviction of Jesse W.\r\nJeffers, Jr., on narcotics dealing charges.\r\n\r\nJeffers, 27, Negro, was found guilty in Judge Alexander Holtzoff’s\r\ncourt on testimony that police, without a search warrant, raided a room\r\nat the Dunbar Hotel and found 19 bottles of cocaine he allegedly had\r\nhidden there.\r\n\r\nJeffers lived elsewhere in the hotel, but the room was rented by\r\nrelatives of his.\r\n\r\nSetting a rare principle of law, the Appeals Court held evidence of\r\nthe cocaine cache should have been excluded from the case because the\r\npolice raid was illegal. It pointed out the Constitution’s Fourth\r\nAmendment specifically bans illegal searches of a defendant’s home,\r\nand said the principle should be enlarged to cover illegal raids on\r\n“premises that were not his.”\r\n\r\nJudge E. Barrett Prettyman, in a dissent from the majority opinion,\r\nsaid “I do not see how an individual’s rights can be invaded by\r\nGovernment seizure of ... unstamped narcotics, not on the individual’s\r\nperson or premises.”\r\n\r\nHe emphasized the case “is important in the enforcement of the\r\nnarcotics laws.”\r\n\r\nThe curious part of the whole affair is that the defendant admitted the\r\nuntaxed, unstamped dope was his. In fact, he demanded its return from\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nIn another of its feats of legal legerdemain, beyond the poor reasoning\r\nof a couple of reporters who didn’t graduate from Harvard Law, the\r\naugust court said to the defendant in effect: “Possession of dope is\r\nillegal, so you can’t have it back, though you didn’t commit any crime\r\nwhen you had it before.”\r\n\r\nTry and figure that one out.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter the Appeals Court again overruled the same judge in\r\nanother narcotics case and ordered a new trial for Clarence Butler on\r\nthe grounds that Holtzoff’s “facial expressions” were prejudicial.\r\n\r\nAn official memorandum of the United States Treasury Department sets\r\nout facts as follows:\r\n\r\nSince early in 1946, the Bureau has experienced repeated delay in\r\nobtaining prosecution of its cases in the District of Columbia. In\r\nnumerous trials where out-of-town agents were witnesses the Bureau\r\nhad to bear the expense of bringing them to Washington for testimony.\r\nRepeatedly, after the agents arrived, the hearings were continued. The\r\nBureau could not stand this gaff and had to “stop narcotic enforcement\r\nin the District of Columbia.”\r\n\r\nDope cannot be manufactured locally. The Washington wholesalers must\r\nget their supplies from the international monopoly. The general\r\npractice in other cities is for the organization to deliver the\r\nwholesale lots to localities where they are to be consumed, but in the\r\ncase of Washington the wholesale jobbers go to the distribution depots\r\nin other cities and pick up carload lots.\r\n\r\nAll narcotics in the United States are controlled at the top by a tight\r\nring of evil men who, in turn, issue state and territorial rights to\r\nmiddlemen. Washington merchants are ordered to make their purchases in\r\nNew York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, but mainly in New York.\r\n\r\nMarijuana is brought up directly from Mexico, but much inferior quality\r\nreefer seed is planted on farms between Washington and Baltimore and in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThe local dope set-up is largely controlled by Negroes, though Chinese\r\nalso are active in the trade and have become more so since the\r\nCommunists took over China. The two tongs frequently import their own.\r\nAt this writing Red China has 500 tons of opium for sale abroad. This\r\nis equal to the world requirements for medical and scientific needs\r\nfor more than a year. Chiang Kai-shek prohibited the production in\r\nChina in 1934. The Communists have revived Jehol and Manchurian opium\r\ncultivation, and are reopening Tientsin dens. The tongs have not been\r\nadhering of late to the agreement which limited them to noncompetitive\r\nsales. Both are selling _pin yen_ (opium) and _bok for_ (heroin).\r\nPolice believe the recent but short-lived tong wars on the West Coast\r\nwere attributable to breaches of the basic compromise, plus efforts of\r\nChinese Communists to take over the tong dope distribution machinery.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, when sources of supply are temporarily cut off, or when\r\nthe Italians are able to offer a more favorable price, the Chinese\r\nSyndicates send a man to buy directly from the Mafia. This dope is\r\nstored in a warehouse near 108th Street and 2nd Avenue, New York City,\r\nin Marcantonio’s bailiwick.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty in narcotics enforcement, not even whispered about\r\nin Washington, is the leakage from diplomatic sources. It is politic\r\nfor the Bureau to deny this is so, because nothing can be done about\r\nit. But huge amounts of concentrated dope come in envoys’ sealed\r\npouches. There is, as everyone in Washington knows, a lively racket\r\nin the diplomatic corps in black market money. No easier method of\r\nacquiring dollars is possible than through sale of dope. Some of this\r\ncontraband is used by members of the embassy staffs, themselves. In\r\nsome Near Eastern and Oriental countries, a daily intake of narcotics\r\nis considered as normal as our use of coffee and tobacco. Many Latin\r\nAmericans are slaves to marijuana, especially in the eating form, not\r\notherwise available in the States. Some of this, which doesn’t find its\r\nway into the channels of trade, is presented by the diplomats to their\r\nAmerican friends.\r\n\r\nThis will be denied, too, but ranking members of the diplomatic corps\r\nwho are narcotic addicts and who can’t get the stuff from other sources\r\nhave it provided for them by the protocol boys in the State Department,\r\nwho withdraw it from official government sources.\r\n\r\nWe were offered reefers by peddlers in the alleys along 4th Street, SW;\r\nalso at the corner of 7th and T and 7th and O, NW.\r\n\r\nIn an all-night diner at Vermont and L, frequented by musicians and hep\r\nkids, we were offered reefers also.\r\n\r\nHard stuff is obtainable with no trouble from street salesmen in Thomas\r\nCircle. In this neighborhood, which is bossed by Attilio Acalotti, you\r\ncan place a bet on a horse, buy a numbers ticket or get a call girl.\r\nThe service is performed for you by sidewalk newsboys and pimps on the\r\nsteps of the National Christian Church.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, rich white racketeers have gone in for opium smoking\r\nthemselves. They get it in Chinatown, where a few poppy parlors are in\r\noperation. As noted, members of the On Leong Tong deal mostly in opium\r\nand the members of Hip Sing in heroin.\r\n\r\nHeroin is sold openly on the corner of 5th and H, in the Hip Sing\r\nsection of Chinatown. To prove this, we became accessories to a\r\nviolation of the law.\r\n\r\nThis is how simple the whole transaction was: We were steered to a\r\nbroken-down wreck named Joe, a well-known dope addict. Despite his\r\nhabit, Joe is an expert locksmith, a genius at his trade. He can’t\r\nwork steadily, but so talented is he, the police and other local law\r\nenforcement bodies and private detective agencies frequently hire him\r\nto pick locks. That’s how he gets the money to support his habit. We\r\ngave Joe $6 to buy a deck of heroin and left him on the corner while we\r\ndrove twenty feet up the block as Joe waited for his contact, across\r\nthe street from the Gospel Mission.\r\n\r\nWe walked back and passed Joe as he handed the $6 to a young Chinese,\r\nwho had appeared out of an area way. Joe said the Chinaman’s name\r\nwas Benny Wong. This is one of the commonest Chinese names, there\r\nmay be 500 with it in Washington. While Benny went to get the stuff,\r\nJoe sat down on a stoop and fell asleep. He had been loading himself\r\nwith secanol, a synthetic, to keep his nerve steady until he got the\r\nheroin, and he was in a pitiable condition. While Joe slumbered, two\r\nmetropolitan cops walked by. They thought he was drunk. One went to get\r\nthe wagon while we talked the other out of pinching our decoy. A few\r\nminutes after the cops left, Benny returned with the heroin. That’s all\r\nthere was to it.\r\n\r\nThe “hooked” addict’s cost of supporting his “yen” runs from $35 a\r\nweek up, though if one “has a monkey on his back,” meaning the urge is\r\ndesperate and irresistible, he will be soaked from $50 to $100 a week.\r\nThose who can afford the best stuff or who no longer get a bang out of\r\ncheap grades are bled for as much as $500 a week.\r\n\r\nWhen Hyman I. Fischbach, brilliant counsel of the Congressional\r\ncommittee investigating crime and law enforcement in the District\r\nof Columbia, queried Assistant Commissioner Harney of the Narcotics\r\nBureau, some startling facts about narcotic addiction were brought out,\r\nyet missed by the press and the public. These hitherto unpublished\r\nexcerpts make interesting reading.\r\n\r\nMR. HARNEY. That also depends too on the cost of the drug and the\r\namount of his income. Addicts can get along--during the war we had lots\r\nof them who had needle habits. Their intake was probably one-fourth\r\ngrain or half a grain a day of actual narcotic. The addict might\r\ndevelop until he gets as high as 20, 30, or 40 grains a day, considered\r\na lethal dose for a non-initiated person. They build up resistance\r\npower. They get hoggish.\r\n\r\nCONGRESSMAN DAVIS. What is that term?\r\n\r\nMR. HARNEY. Use a lot of the drug. In days when drugs were freely\r\navailable that was one reason for institution of cocaine. A man would\r\nstupefy himself with narcotics and with cocaine he would get an extra\r\nthrill and get out of it and brighten up and keep from going to sleep.\r\nThe addict may spend $5 or $10 a day in addition to other expenses, and\r\nnot being able, or disposed to work, usually becomes a thief. He can\r\nbe a prowler or he might be a pickpocket. Some addicts are very good\r\nburglars. He might be a stick-up-man, not often.\r\n\r\nA woman will be a prostitute or shoplifter. A man might be a panderer.\r\nMany addicts buy in decks, 8 ounces or 2 or 3 ounces. The preaddict\r\nwould use a few grains. It differs in different localities.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIS. Does the price differ?\r\n\r\nMR. HARNEY. Expressed in terms of actual narcotic content for the\r\npreaddict it may be $2 or $3 a grain.\r\n\r\nMR. FISCHBACH. Mr. Harney, is it your point that an individual\r\notherwise law abiding necessarily turns to petty crime in order to\r\nsupport the addiction?\r\n\r\nMR. HARNEY. I would not say necessarily, but it is often apparent.\r\nI want to emphasize that addiction, particularly in the past, has\r\nbeen much among the criminal element. A man was down in a dangerous\r\nenvironment before he became addicted; he had to get in that sort of\r\nassociation in contrast to the casual person who might become an addict\r\nfrom medical reasons, but the ordinary addict becomes so by association.\r\n\r\nMR. FISCHBACH. Then your point is there is an epidemic effect to it?\r\n\r\nMR. HARNEY. We have a rather unusual and alarming situation which\r\ndeveloped since the war. It does not quite follow the pattern I set\r\nout. My theory used to be that most addicts were old enough to be\r\nassociated with criminals and get into the underworld with addicts\r\nbefore they themselves became addicts. Today, in certain localities,\r\nwe have young people, some minors, and the pattern seems to be\r\nexperimentation in marijuana first. That loses its thrill and those\r\npersons become addicts to heroin. Sometimes cocaine comes into the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIS. Is marijuana used as a starter and later other narcotics are\r\nused?\r\n\r\nMR. HARNEY. I would not say always, but frequently. Young people get\r\ninto the marijuana atmosphere and you have a field for the cocaine and\r\nheroin addicts.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIS. Are they induced to begin with marijuana by purveyors of\r\nheroin, cocaine, morphine, and other drugs, to lead them into addiction?\r\n\r\nMR. HARNEY. That pattern follows. Later dealers sell all three\r\ncommodities. Youngsters come into the marijuana smoking atmosphere and\r\nsoon there is no kick in it, and someone will tell them, “Try this.”\r\n\r\nMR. FISCHBACH. Now who is that person?\r\n\r\nMR. HARNEY. The peddler, or a cocaine addict, or a heroin addict.\r\n\r\nMR. FISCHBACH. I would like to direct the attention of the committee to\r\nthe case of Charles M. Roberts, alias Jim Yellow, and ask if that case\r\npresents some problems which your Bureau experienced in the District\r\nwith regard to the enforcement of the narcotics law. Present the facts\r\nin the case of Jim Roberts, what kind of a person he was, how he lived,\r\nwhat quantity of drugs he had when taken into custody.\r\n\r\nMR. HARNEY. Jim Roberts had two convictions for violation of the\r\nFederal narcotics laws. He had convictions for other crimes, including\r\ncharges of assault. We used an agent in an undercover capacity. Roberts\r\nlived in a luxuriously furnished apartment. Some of these figures I\r\ncite are on his own statement and probably you will allow for bragging,\r\nbut he had a beautifully carved television set which he claimed cost\r\nhim a couple thousand dollars, and he drove a new Cadillac. While\r\nthe officers were in his presence money was handed to him in a paper\r\ngrocery bag. Roberts referred to a hatchet and said he was waiting to\r\nchristen it in blood. When the car was seized the hatchet was under the\r\nseat of the car. Roberts’ style of living represents big-shot narcotic\r\ndealers. It makes a tremendous impression on others who might think of\r\nentering the racket.\r\n\r\n                       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to users of standard narcotics, many in Washington go in\r\nfor esoteric kicks. A growing fad in the Negro district is to inhale\r\nincense with marijuana added.\r\n\r\nBarbiturates are sold without prescription, because the D.C. law has\r\nno teeth in it. Some become habituated to these drugs and, instead of\r\nbeing put to sleep by them, get all the wallop out of them that others\r\nget from opium. Many drug stores sell nembutals over the counter for\r\n25 cents each. Nembutals are the prostitutes’ favorite. Among initiates\r\nthey are known as goof balls, or nemies. They grew popular during World\r\nWar II, when there was a scarcity of narcotics. Most who prefer goof\r\nballs to marijuana usually end up on morphine, heroin or cocaine.\r\n\r\nEvelyn Walsh McLean’s daughter, who was married to Senator Reynolds,\r\ndied from an overdose of goof balls.\r\n\r\nAs elsewhere, reefers are the real menace. This product of the hemp\r\nplant is easily available, can be grown anywhere, is cheap, and in some\r\ncircles is in good repute. There is no such thing as an innocent reefer\r\nsmoker. Sooner or later, anyone on “muggles” must become a law-breaker\r\nto some degree. Peddlers put their heads together, know how badly any\r\ncustomer is hooked. Then they jack up prices to beyond what most people\r\ncan pay honestly.\r\n\r\nAll weed-heads are cop-haters. Even in reasonably normal condition they\r\ncarry a fierce resentment against conventional forces of society.\r\n\r\nReefer smoking is not habitual in the sense that the addict suffers\r\n“withdrawal” symptoms, as when he is taken off other stuff. But neither\r\nis cocaine habit-forming in that sense. Both work on the emotions.\r\nTheir use causes a physiological change in the brain. The reefer smoker\r\nwho gives the stuff up does not turn violently ill. But he doesn’t give\r\nit up. He likes its effect and needs its lift to give him courage.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, all reefer smokers go on to cocaine, because the\r\neffect is the same as from reefers, a hundredfold. When the bang of the\r\nhemp wears off, cocaine is the only thing that can take its place. And\r\nbecause cocaine is so expensive, one must become a criminal to afford\r\nits use. And the cocaine gives one the courage to be a criminal.\r\n\r\nThe subject of tea-hounds brings us quite naturally to our next\r\nchapter, juvenile delinquency, in which stimulants are a large factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. THE YOUNG IN HEART\r\n\r\n\r\nJuvenile delinquency as a topic has become a bromide. You’d think\r\nthere was little left to add. But here we found not only more of it,\r\nbut conditions behind it were frequently the exact opposite of those\r\nobtaining in other populous cities.\r\n\r\nIt is generally accepted as beyond dispute that youngsters go wrong\r\nbecause of poverty, congestion, lack of play-space, exposure to\r\nthe tenement atmosphere, the saloon and miserable home life. But\r\nWashington, with its top average of prosperity, nothing that could\r\nrightfully be called slums, no tenements and no out-and-out saloons,\r\nhas a more alarming per capita of teen-age law-breakers than New York,\r\nChicago, Detroit or Kansas City.\r\n\r\nRemarkable, moreover, is the discovery that white youth is more\r\ndelinquent proportionately to the total of all criminals of their race\r\nthan Negro youth. Over all, however, more colored children break laws\r\nthan whites. A study of records, talks with social workers and personal\r\nprying into many cases make it evident that more young people go wrong\r\nbecause of overprivilege than underprivilege.\r\n\r\nMost kids who get into trouble are well fed, over the height and weight\r\nscientifically charted for their age, are well dressed, and have\r\nsuperior intelligence quotients. We checked on one, 15 years old, five\r\nfeet nine inches tall, weighing 140 pounds, the son of a government\r\nofficial who earns $12,000 a year. He confessed to more than 100\r\nlarcenies, burglaries and purse-snatches, and he had escaped from two\r\npostal inspectors who arrested him for looting mail-boxes, searching\r\nfor government checks on which he intended to forge endorsements. He\r\nand a 12-year-old accomplice had broken into 37 houses in the NW area\r\nin 20 months and had robbed scores of cars. He said:\r\n\r\n“Everybody here is on the make. We want money, too.”\r\n\r\nOf 2,412 arrests of white males for Part 1 offenses, serious crimes\r\nincluding homicide, rape, robbery, burglary, larceny, auto-theft and\r\naggravated assault, 564, almost 25 per cent, were committed by boys 15\r\nand under; 1,897 of the 2,412, or 75 per cent, were committed by boys\r\n20 or under.\r\n\r\nThe figures for Negroes are the reverse. There adults are in the\r\npreponderant majority. During the time when white males of all ages\r\ncommitted the 2,412 specific offenses for which they were arrested,\r\n7,729 Negroes were apprehended. Of this large number, only 1,702 of the\r\ncrimes were committed by Negro boys 15 and under; of these the number\r\ncharged to males 20 years and under was 3,477, considerably less than\r\nhalf, whereas white juveniles rolled up 75 per cent of the total for\r\ntheir race.\r\n\r\nAlso a departure from the usual big-town findings is the sex\r\nproportion. Juvenile delinquency is almost a complete male monopoly,\r\nabout the only one in the female-heavy District. Harlem and\r\nBronzeville, Hell’s Kitchen and the dregs of Brooklyn have their\r\n“debs,” the feminine auxiliaries of the boys’ gangs of muggers,\r\nstreet-fighters and thieves. The girls constitute a good one-third\r\nof the problem children, engaged in picking pockets, shoplifting and\r\nprostitution. But in Washington, in the period when the 2,412 serious\r\ncrimes were charged to white males, only 309 were committed by females,\r\nand of these only 19 were under the age of 15; 96 were 20 and under.\r\nNegro females of all ages were arrested for 1,091 Part 1 crimes, of\r\nwhich only 38 were girls up to 15 and only 161 were 20 and under.\r\n\r\nOne reason for the huge incidence of juvenile delinquency, but by no\r\nmeans the decisive one, was an idiosyncrasy of the population trend\r\nhere, topsy-turvy to every other in the country during the last 10\r\nyears. While the mean age of Americans was growing to such an extent\r\nthat it appeared we were becoming a nation of old people, Washington’s\r\npopulation increased 26 per cent--but its child population, as of birth\r\nrecords, increased more than 60 per cent. Nobody seems to know why.\r\n\r\nIf this has anything to do with the high influx of Negroes, the figures\r\nabove quoted challenge it as a delinquency cause. Our observations\r\nled us to the conclusion that the principal influence is a system and\r\nhabit of coddling found nowhere else. By Act of Congress, none but\r\nthe Juvenile Court can take jurisdiction over offenders before they\r\nare 15; defendants under 18 must be transferred to it on the court’s\r\ndemand. This branch is dominated by fat matrons and skinny old maids\r\nwho make a profession or a vocation of “child welfare.” To them that\r\nmeans no punishment; everybody is innocent. In time the judges, New\r\nDeal appointees all, many from crackpot groups with socialistic and\r\nother distorted tendencies, have been conditioned to contempt of the\r\nlaw and slant toward paternalistic lectures and acquittals. The result\r\nis an enormous rate of recidivists, and the figures represent multiple\r\narrests of such repeaters rather than of so many individuals.\r\n\r\nIn the rare instances when the punks are sentenced to confinement, they\r\ngo to federal reformatories, where they get short terms and de luxe\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nStatistics are cold; many people skip them or disbelieve them. But cops\r\nare practical. And so appalling has moppet misbehavior become that an\r\nextra detail of 30 officers has been assigned on duty around the clock\r\nto watch and buzz the teensters, in an unprecedented campaign to ease\r\nWashington’s biggest growing pain.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum in which federally appointed judges and officials\r\nresponsible only to Congress can place a community is well illustrated\r\nby the juvenile delinquency procedure.\r\n\r\nJudge Edith H. Cockrill, of the Juvenile Court, adjudicated in a star\r\nchamber, concealed from the public. Nothing came out of her court but\r\nrumors. One lawyer said her court is “a social worker’s dream and a\r\nlawyer’s nightmare.” He said children and their parents are treated as\r\n“patients,” none as offenders. The result is that about three-fourths\r\nof the kids processed through Washington Juvenile Court grow up to be\r\nadult criminals. Public pressure forced her to issue her first report\r\nlast month, after more than two years on the bench.\r\n\r\nJudge Cockrill is a typical Fair Deal beneficiary. She graduated from\r\nthe University of Tennessee in 1939, then got her legal experience with\r\nthe OPA. Figure out how that qualifies her to sit as a juvenile judge.\r\nBefore her appointment, a couple of years ago, by President Truman, she\r\nhad never tried a case in juvenile court. Her present calendar calls\r\nfor about 60 cases a day, including bastardy, nonsupport and parental\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThe previous incumbent on the bench was Faye L. Bentley, who\r\nvoluntarily committed herself to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital--for Mental\r\nDisorders--for treatment in 1948. This is a course we recommend to some\r\nother judges.\r\n\r\nConvicted juvenile delinquents are sent to the National Training School\r\nfor Boys, the National Training School for Girls, and the Industrial\r\nHome School.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Justice estimates three of every four graduates\r\nof these reformatories become adult criminals. And this though the\r\nTraining School for Boys, known as “The Hill,” goes in for all modern\r\ntechniques and dodads, such as plastic surgery, psychotherapy and\r\npsychology. There are church facilities, athletics, television, radio\r\nand musical instruments. The boys are taught shoemaking, cooking,\r\nfarming and other trades. The school specializes in group therapy,\r\nwhich has its advantages and its absurdities. Sometimes an entire group\r\ncan be spoiled by one or two tough young kids who become ringleaders.\r\n\r\nExcept in the Negro sections, Washington has been spared the scourge\r\nof kid gangs. There are no major foreign-born settlements in town.\r\nTherefore the white kids seldom organize into mobs. Juvenile\r\ndelinquency in other cities is often blamed on Italian, Irish, Jewish,\r\nMexican and Puerto Rican under-age gangs.\r\n\r\nBut organization seems to be coming into fashion. While these lines\r\nwere being typed, three local men were attacked and brutally beaten by\r\na gang of 12 teensters in the 700 block, 6th Street, NW, apparently\r\nfor the fun of it. The victims said the boys shouted insults at them\r\nfrom the sidewalk as they drove past. The three stopped and got out\r\nof the car. The gang then swarmed on them, beat them with bottles,\r\nbelt-buckles, brass knuckles and improvised blackjacks.\r\n\r\nWherever young white criminals work together they are more often\r\nprone to choose school or college mates, or members of the same\r\nboys’ clubs as buddies. For instance, police broke up the exclusive\r\n“Weekend Burglars” gang, whose activities had stirred up residents\r\nof an exclusive NW residential section when they discovered that the\r\ncriminals were home on leave on weekend passes from a military academy\r\nin Maryland. The three boys, the oldest 17, all came from wealthy\r\nfamilies. Their method of “cracking” a home was this:\r\n\r\nThey would ring a doorbell; if no one answered, they cut through the\r\nscreen and smashed the glass in the door. Inside the house, they\r\nransacked it for three articles, taking nothing else. Playfully they\r\nwould toss furniture helter-skelter and break china. The money they\r\nspent. The whiskey they drank. The stolen guns they showed off with.\r\n\r\nKids of all ages and both sexes and races are smoking reefers in\r\nprodigious quantities. These are easily obtainable from peddlers who\r\nwork outside the schools, and inside some schools, from students,\r\nthemselves. The current price for the weeds to school-children is 50\r\ncents each, sometimes three for a dollar.\r\n\r\nThe young dope-fiends are not confined to any neighborhood of the\r\ncity or to any economic class. One high school in the area, attended\r\nby children whose parents are in the upper brackets, is reported to\r\nhave 95 per cent addiction. A major kid crime element is marijuana.\r\nYoungsters go on from it to more potent narcotics, then commit petty\r\ncrimes to obtain the funds to buy the drugs. Reefers and other dope\r\nsharply bring out latent lawlessness.\r\n\r\nHigh school athletic events have become a scandal. Bootleggers purvey\r\nliquor openly in the stands. Hundreds of stinking-drunk youngsters are\r\nswept out of the stadiums after every game.\r\n\r\nProfessional gamblers attend these games and make book without any\r\npretense, taking bets from the kids of from 25 cents up and giving\r\ntickets in return.\r\n\r\nNeighborhood stores adjacent to schools also purvey bootleg liquor and\r\ntake bets from the juveniles, not only for their own school games, but\r\non the horses and numbers.\r\n\r\nJuvenile delinquency is almost as bad in the suburbs. There kids have\r\ncars, and “hot rod” races are common.\r\n\r\nYoungsters ape their elders when they see the callousness of parents\r\nto the processes of law. Laxity, favoritism, New Deal “liberalism,” a\r\ngeneral spirit of contempt for law enforcement are reflected in the\r\ngrowing generation. The solid virtues are “old hat.” Youth is on a\r\nrampage.\r\n\r\nWashington has no monopoly on young criminals, but it has more of them\r\nper capita than any other city in the nation.\r\n\r\nLame-brains like to point out that only colored people are confined to\r\n“slums” in Washington; that no whites live in ghettos in the capital.\r\nIf so, how come that juvenile delinquency among the whites is as\r\nstartling as among the blacks, more so, in fact? As reported elsewhere\r\nin this book, Washington’s crime rate leads the nation. It is all the\r\nmore startling to discover how many of these crimes are committed by\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. BOOZE AND BOTTLES\r\n\r\n\r\nWashingtonians imbibe three times as much as you do, friend voter.\r\nExcept for a few silly restrictions, no place in the country offers\r\nas many inducements to the potential alcoholic. The answer is, 14,151\r\ndrunks last year created a jail “housing crisis.” The number more than\r\ndoubled in the last five years. Liquor consumption of the District\r\nis three times the U. S. average. Every resident, including new-born\r\ninfants, soaked up almost four gallons of hooch last year.\r\n\r\nEven allowing for thirsty tourists, conventioners, and Virginia and\r\nMaryland commuters, Washington drinks more than any other U. S. city,\r\nincluding dissolute New York and debauched Chicago.\r\n\r\nThis is the place where price control was invented, yet the District\r\nhas no peacetime minimum price law on bottled goods. You can buy\r\nstandard brands for a dollar less than anywhere else. Many unnamed\r\nwhiskeys and gins are cheap; it doesn’t pay to cook your own. Whiskey\r\ncosts less than $2.50 a fifth, and gin can be bought for $1.75. Yet the\r\nbootleg business is a major industry. Millions of gallons sold in the\r\nDistrict, on which no tax was paid, swell the known figures.\r\n\r\nThe liquor control situation is an anomaly. Like the District of\r\nColumbia, itself, the liquor laws were born of compromise, this between\r\nCongressmen from the wet and bone-dry states.\r\n\r\nYou can drink hard liquor in restaurants and cocktail lounges, but only\r\nwhen sitting at a table. Beer and wines may be dispensed over the bar,\r\nbut not to standees. You’ve got to find a stool. Some genius figured\r\nyou can’t get plastered sitting down, forgetting that many who drink\r\nand sit can’t stand up again.\r\n\r\nHard liquor may not be sold on Sundays, though beer and wine can be.\r\nBars can remain open until 2 A.M. every night except Saturday and\r\nSunday, when they must shutter promptly at 12. You can’t line drinks\r\non your table; anything in your possession at the closing hour will\r\nbe swept out of your hand. Most places issue the last call 15 minutes\r\nbefore the limit and in that final quarter-hour there are wild\r\ndrinking scenes as customers try to get drunk all at once.\r\n\r\nLiquor for off-premise consumption is sold in bottle stores, of which\r\nthere are about 350. They close at nine on weekdays and at midnight\r\non Saturdays and all day Sundays. A package store license costs $815\r\na year, but it will cost you $50,000 to buy one, as the ABC Board has\r\nfrozen the rolls.\r\n\r\nThose who can’t get a bun on by closing time have no trouble locating\r\nan oasis after the curfew. At this writing there are 613 so-called\r\nbottle-clubs running in the District, in addition to hundreds of gin\r\nflats in Black Town, where almost any cab driver will steer you.\r\nBootleggers work certain street corners, where you can buy bottle goods\r\nafter hours.\r\n\r\nThe legal age minimum is 18 for beer and 21 for hard stuff, but this\r\nlaw, like almost all other rules and regulations, is breached more\r\noften than honored.\r\n\r\nCitizens and Congressmen seek sporadically to rationalize local liquor\r\nlaws, in hope of cutting down violations. But the dry bloc buries the\r\nbills in committees. Everyone was surprised when the House District\r\nAffairs Committee managed to bring up a bill permitting sale until two\r\non Saturday nights. This turned out to be a piece of parliamentary\r\njockeying in the fight against the President’s FEPC Bill, of all\r\nthings. That law, obnoxious to Southerners, would have come up for a\r\nvote unless one with legislative priority could be sent in ahead. And\r\nthat bill, according to the calendar, was a proposed law to liberalize\r\ndrinking habits in the District. So the Southerners brought it up,\r\nside-tracked the FEPC, and, a couple of weeks later, when it came time\r\nto vote on the booze act, roundly routed it.\r\n\r\nThe thirsty visitor finds it easy to find a bottle-club and become a\r\nfull-fledged drinking member on the spot. The names, locations and\r\nowners of these after-hour spots vary from day to day. Occasionally,\r\nafter clean-ups, all or most close for a couple of weeks or a couple of\r\nmonths. As these words were written the District was recovering from\r\nits most painful drought, brought on by revelations before the District\r\nCrime Investigating Committee, headed by Attorney Fischbach.\r\n\r\nThe front-page stories forced the cops and U. S. Attorney Fay to close\r\nsome joints. Others lay low awhile. A murder in the Hideaway Club\r\ndidn’t help, either.\r\n\r\nWe made an intensive study of bottle-clubs. Of the score or more\r\nwe visited, we found only one apparently operating legitimately and\r\naccording to law. That was the Lyre’s Club, about which more later. Of\r\nthe 600-plus such clubs in Washington, it is possible that a few adhere\r\nto the book, but we didn’t hear of them.\r\n\r\nOn paper, bottle-clubs are supposed to be membership organizations,\r\nincorporated for social and benevolent purposes. Members bring their\r\nown liquor, which is held for them, their names on the labels. The\r\nclubs sell setups and food.\r\n\r\nCharlie Ford, a Washington attorney to whom we will have occasion to\r\ntip our hats in much more detail later, is the lawyer for a number of\r\nclubs. He officiated at their births.\r\n\r\nHere’s how most of them really work. Regular patrons, i.e., “members,”\r\nare supposed to pay annual dues of about $10, depending on the club,\r\nbut most regulars pay nothing. Transients, i.e., guests, are charged a\r\ndoor-fee of one or two dollars, depending on the club.\r\n\r\nSetups are sold, to those who bring their own liquor, at a nominal\r\nprice of 35 cents and up. If you haven’t your stuff parked or with you,\r\nmost clubs will sell it to you under the counter or advise you it can\r\nbe had from a guy seated in front of the entrance in a car.\r\n\r\nThese clubs are incorporated as non-profit private enterprises, not\r\nrequired to pay Federal amusement taxes even when they provide floor\r\nshows and dancing. Nor need they have ABC liquor licenses, because they\r\nare supposed not to be selling.\r\n\r\nMany of them operate as follows: The prospective owner or owners and\r\na couple of their friends or employes incorporate as a social or\r\nbenevolent organization. The real owner then rents and furnishes the\r\npremises, which he in turn sublets to the so-called social club at a\r\nrent which will approximate all the “take” from membership and door\r\ncharges. The “club” thereupon turns over the kitchen, the sale of\r\nsetups and the hat-checking and cigaret stand to the real proprietor,\r\nas a concession, in return for a token payment, which in turn goes back\r\nto the proprietor with the rent.\r\n\r\nIn clubs that sell liquor illegally or provide gambling, records of\r\nsuch activities are not kept. The proceeds go directly into the owner’s\r\npocket. If raided or threatened by cleanup drives, the clubs disband.\r\nThe owner organizes a new club under the same terms and repeats the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nA new twist is being added since the Fischbach exposé. Some club\r\nproprietors are making deals with units of legitimate bodies, such as\r\nveteran groups, labor unions, etc., whereby the clubs share some of\r\nthe profits. One, the Amvets, closed after the Hideaway shooting, its\r\nCharter lifted by the national organization.\r\n\r\nBottle-clubs find customers in a variety of ways. Some employes of\r\nlicensed night clubs and restaurants hand out guest-membership cards\r\nto patrons who inquire where they can go after two. These steerers\r\nwrite their names on the cards and draw a kickback for every customer,\r\nusually a dollar a head.\r\n\r\nMany cab drivers shill for the bottle-clubs, as well as for gin flats.\r\nCab drivers’ pay varies with the size of the party. They sometimes\r\nget as much as $5 a haul. They are the chief source of prospective\r\npatronage for the colored bottle-clubs. More than 500 after-hour spots\r\nin Washington are operated by Negroes or in the Negro district. All\r\ncater to blacks and whites. The twenty to thirty white bottle-clubs\r\nrunning are segregated as to Negro musicians and actors. In one club\r\nwe saw three pretty blonde girls with two Negro men. They were all\r\nreefer-smokers, palpably.\r\n\r\nCabbies who hustle for the bottle-clubs not only do so in front of\r\nhotels and licensed cabarets and restaurants, but try to pirate\r\ncustomers away from opposition clubs. When they see a prospect waiting\r\nfor the peephole to open, they tout him away “to a better place, where\r\nyou won’t have any trouble.” The Hideaway, in Georgetown, depended\r\nalmost entirely on such maneuvers, as it is far out and off the beaten\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\nThe pirates were acting so brazenly, police stepped in to curb the\r\npractice by giving tickets to drivers parked at strategic spots. The\r\nlaw requires cabs to cruise at all times, except in posted hack-stands,\r\nwhich are only outside major hotels.\r\n\r\nFood, dancing, entertainment, and often dames are for sale at the\r\nclubs. Sometimes waitresses are available, but they work until 6 in the\r\nmorning, by which time the average rounder has forgotten all about it.\r\nThe price for a $10 girl picked up in a club is $20.\r\n\r\nSome provide craps, stud poker and other games. The night we were\r\nthere, a crap game ran on the top floor of the Atlas Club, on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, two blocks from the White House, and at the\r\nStage-crafters Club, another hangout of General Harry Vaughan. The\r\nAtlas applied for a private club liquor license, which would permit\r\nlegal sales, but the application was held up by the ABC Board until\r\nthe club president, Sidney Brown, who was abroad, could return for a\r\npersonal appearance. It happened that Mr. Brown, the sponsor of this\r\nafter-hour spot, was abroad because he is an employe of the State\r\nDepartment. Some months previously, gambler Gary Quinn said he was the\r\npresident of the Atlas. The license was denied, so it is still running\r\nas a bottle-club.\r\n\r\nAmong the after-hour clubs operating at this writing are the Top Side,\r\n501 12th Street, NW; the Guess Who, 811 L Street, NW; the Acropolis,\r\n719 9th Street, NW (patronized by Greeks); the Culinary Arts, 307\r\nM Street, NE, and the Yamasee, 1214 U Street, NW. The last two are\r\ncolored clubs.\r\n\r\nThe most notorious of the after-hour-spots speaks, the Gold Key, was\r\nclosed by Committee revelations. It has since reorganized as the\r\nDowntown Club, with some of the same characters. Most of the others\r\nare patronized by unimportant transients or night workers, such as\r\nmusicians, waiters and bartenders.\r\n\r\nThe Gold Key got the cream and they’re back again. Among its regular\r\npatrons were local sports, including playboy Senators and officials.\r\nWaitresses there made as much as $150 a week in tips, whereas they are\r\nlucky to knock down $50 in other places. When lawyer Charlie Ford drew\r\nup the papers for the Gold Key, its original organizers were Albert\r\nGlickfield, alias Al Brown, Patsy Meserole, and Harry Conners, his\r\nbrother-in-law. Meserole is a former New York gangster, one of the last\r\nsurviving members of the late Legs Diamond mob. Glickfield is a gambler\r\nand associate of Frank Erickson. The accountant for this after-hour\r\nclub was Henry W. Davis, a division head in the Accounting Division\r\nof the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, an agency of the U. S.\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nMeserole left the Gold Key to open the Stagecrafters, 433 3rd Street,\r\nNW, and took a lot of the top political and theatrical business with\r\nhim. His partner is Dominic Ferone, another ex-New York mobster.\r\nGeneral Vaughan is a patron. It sells liquor openly and provides\r\ngambling, and waitresses will get women for them as wants ’em. Meserole\r\ntestified under oath that many Congressmen and Senators were customers.\r\n\r\nWhen Congressional investigations indicated the club was operated\r\nillegally, it was shuttered until the heat was off. But so heavy was\r\nthe influence of its owners, through business ties with members of the\r\nNew York Syndicate and the exalted position of its patrons, that as\r\nsoon as the investigation shut down, the club reopened, not quietly,\r\nbut brazenly.\r\n\r\nWe have before us an ad in a Washington daily which reads:\r\n\r\n            NOTICE....\r\n      Members and Their Guests\r\n      STAGECRAFTERS CLUB\r\n          NOW REOPENED\r\n        Same Place....\r\n        Same Policy....\r\n        Same Committees....\r\n        Same Benefits....\r\n      Membership Drive Now On\r\n       Help Get New Members!\r\n    EDWARD P. MESEROLE, Secretary\r\n\r\nThe Stagecrafters is the haunt of unsavory “introducers” who make\r\ncontacts with wealthy chumps there, offering girls and gambling. Police\r\nrecently arrested a lout, who, they charged, had become acquainted\r\nwith William H. Engelmann, a photo-lithographer from Baltimore, out\r\nfor a fling with friends in the Stagecrafters. The prisoner suggested\r\na blackjack game and took him to a room in the Ambassador Hotel, which\r\nis owned by Gwen Cafritz’s husband. Engelmann was soon a $1,500 loser,\r\nand asked his host to cash a check. He said he would, at the hotel\r\ncashier’s booth, and left with Engelmann’s check. Engelmann became\r\nsuspicious when the man didn’t return after an hour. He found the man\r\nhad checked out. When the fellow was caught, police said, they found on\r\nhim a deck of marked cards.\r\n\r\nAnother bottle-club that opened after the adjournment of the\r\nCongressional investigation is on the site of the Palm Grill, at 14th\r\nand Q, under a new name, the Sunrise.\r\n\r\nThe shuttered Turf-and-Grid was reborn as the aforementioned Amvets.\r\nThe Turf’s owner, Richard O’Connell, has been employed by the\r\ngovernment since the beginning of the New Deal, in such agencies as the\r\noriginal NRA, the Department of the Interior (under “Honest Harold”\r\nIckes) and more recently in the Red-infested Wages and Hours Division\r\nof the Department of Labor.\r\n\r\nAnother club that operates on and off is the United Nations Social\r\nClub. When we visited it, its chief social activity was a crap game.\r\nAnother is the Crystal Cavern.\r\n\r\nWhen George P. Harding, a 39-year-old gunman and underworld fingerman,\r\nwas shot to death by Joe Nesline, notorious Prohibition era bootlegger,\r\nin the Hideaway--an aftermath of last year’s conquest of Washington by\r\nthe Mafia--Washington’s bottle-clubs took another shellacking.\r\n\r\nCongressmen beat their breasts, newspapers shrilled, the DA promised\r\naction and the cops vowed to close all the joints. For a few days a\r\ncouple of clubs went easy; at this writing most were again in action.\r\n\r\nThe Hideaway, scene of the crime, was reported “closed for good” by the\r\nprecinct captain, but Joseph Horowitz, an owner, announced “business as\r\nusual” while the cops were telling everyone the premises were empty. At\r\npress time, the present and future status of the club was in doubt.\r\n\r\nLegitimate clubs are a necessity until the District authorities amend\r\nthe outmoded liquor laws. One which we liked is the Lyre’s. Most\r\nmembers of this club are night-workers whose hours are such that they\r\ncould never get a drink or relax if they had no place to go after\r\n2 A.M. Among them are musicians of the big hotels and night clubs,\r\nwaiters, waitresses, hatcheck gals, government swing-shift people and\r\nvisiting entertainers. We spent considerable time at the Lyre’s and\r\nnoted everything was on the square. No patrons were permitted to enter\r\nwho weren’t members or their guests, and no drinks were served except\r\nout of members’ bottles.\r\n\r\nThe Lyre’s is chummy. There’s a mainfloor bar and lounge and a basement\r\ndining-room and dance floor. Most of the musicians in town hang out\r\nthere and put on jam sessions all night long. Its hosts are Vince and\r\nMildred Carr, former Baltimore and Philadelphia night club operators.\r\nThey have many friends in show business. The Carrs won’t tolerate\r\nhookers and drunks, allow no soliciting, gambling or hoodlums. But\r\nunfortunately the Lyre’s is unique.\r\n\r\nNot all who want to drink late can afford to or can get into or know\r\nabout bottle-clubs. Those who spend an evening in a licensed cabaret\r\nand find themselves still sober or out for fun at two, or at midnight\r\non Saturday, are up against it. Licensed clubs and cocktail lounges\r\ncan’t sell for off-premises consumption. If you tip your waiter\r\nliberally he will dig up an empty Coca-Cola bottle and let you fill it\r\nwith the remaining liquor at your table.\r\n\r\nSome people who run dry at midnight Saturdays drive to Maryland, where\r\nbars and package-stores close at 2 A.M.\r\n\r\nWashington is loaded with bootleggers and blind tigers. We have already\r\nreferred to the gin-flats in Black Town, where home-made gin--raw\r\nethyl alcohol flavored with juniper and sometimes diluted with apple\r\ncider--is sold. Prices are reasonable, as low as 50 cents a drink\r\nand $3 a bottle. The flats, usually five- or six-room affairs, have\r\njuke-boxes. Parlor floors are cleared for dancing. Beds are handy. If\r\ncops come, it’s a private party. But cops don’t come.\r\n\r\nWe pulled up in our cab to the NE corner of Popner and U Streets, and\r\nwaited five minutes. A colored man came over and asked us what we\r\nwanted. He had gin, Scotch and corn. We bought gin, trade-marked, $2.50\r\nfor a pint.\r\n\r\nDavid Douglas Davenport, self-styled “Union Station bootlegger,” has\r\nbeen selling booze in the railroad terminal for years. He charges $5\r\nfor a pint of whiskey, which he keeps stashed in an automatic coin\r\nlocker. Davenport has a record for court appearances, 115 in one year.\r\nHe lost to the law once, and did two years in the District jail. The\r\nday he got out of the can he was in business in Union Station again and\r\nstill was at this writing, though arrested again and out on bail.\r\n\r\nMany after-hour bootleggers sell legitimate stuff, which they buy at\r\nWashington’s low prices, and retail at 100 or 200 per cent profit.\r\nHundreds of other bootleggers, especially Negroes, dispense moonshine.\r\nMost of this is acquired from mob sources in Brooklyn and New Jersey,\r\nwhere the Mafia operates gigantic stills capable of producing thousands\r\nof gallons a day. According to Carroll Mealy, capable and efficient\r\nhead of the Alcoholic Tax Unit, the rum-runners take this stuff to\r\nWashington in 1940 Fords, with Cadillac or racing motors in place of\r\noriginal power. This model is preferred for its carrying capacity,\r\nmaneuverability and inconspicuous appearance. The souped-up motors can\r\nhit 120 miles an hour against pursuit.\r\n\r\nMuch moonshine is made in Washington, though none of the raided stills\r\nwas found with a large capacity. The stuff is cooked at 2nd and G\r\nStreets, NW. But legitimate Washington sources supply liquor to be run\r\ninto nearby dry and semi-dry states and counties.\r\n\r\nNot all who buy from bootleggers get drunk. Some get robbed.\r\n\r\n“The tough part about it was that I never got the whiskey,” Army Sgt.\r\nFilmore M. Broom, 41, moaned to police.\r\n\r\nHe said a Negro offered to sell him a bottle, but when the sergeant\r\npulled out his wallet, containing $190, to pay, the Negro snatched it\r\nand ran--with the whiskey, too. This happened at 5th and Neal Streets,\r\nNW, and police are looking for a Negro with red suspenders and a white\r\nstraw hat. No winter description available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20. CAFE AU CORN\r\n\r\n\r\nForeigners who have never seen the United States dream of beholding\r\nits wonders, of which the first two are New York and Washington. They\r\nenvision not the monuments or the Government Printing Office, but a\r\nglittering world capital swirling with diplomats in colorful costumes,\r\nofficers in dress uniforms, and pageantry punctuated with dazzling\r\ndames of the haute monde and the demi-monde. For this is the capital\r\nof capitals, and it must have everything, including what none of the\r\nothers has--dough.\r\n\r\nIf there is any spectacular life in Washington, that is not for the\r\neye of the uninitiated stranger. The days are vapid and the nights are\r\nstupid. Washington is dominated by elected and appointed functionaries\r\nwho are schooled to believe they must never be caught having fun.\r\nTherefore, after dark it is more like Paducah than like Paris.\r\n\r\nThere are many hotel grills and lounges, which are night clubs after a\r\nfashion, and some cafes; but their chief patronage depends on visitors\r\nand government dependents. Both classes are drawn largely from farms\r\nand villages, with only a minor proportion from centers of laughter and\r\nlight. Washington’s night life is a dull, dismal and dreary reflection\r\nof our Main Streets, hard cider and juke-box roistering.\r\n\r\nThe few local sports and the free-fingered lobbyists seek their\r\npleasure at private parties and behind closed doors of hotel suites,\r\nor fly northward to nearby New York with its El Morocco and the Stork\r\nClub.\r\n\r\nThe two principal night clubs in Washington are operated by Chinese,\r\nwith American shows and dance bands. They are the Lotus and the Casino\r\nRoyal.\r\n\r\nBoth are built for the mass-consumption trade, with popular prices\r\nand acres of dance floors. Hicks and tourists are dance-bugs. Dick\r\nLam, host at the Lotus, is one of the town’s best-known and best-liked\r\nshowmen. He was one of the original founders of the China Doll, in New\r\nYork, and has uptown manners and know-how.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Mirror, around the corner, specializes in hot jive. Kavakos,\r\nas mentioned, features nudes, as does the Players, opposite the Center\r\nMarket.\r\n\r\nNot only can and do some Washington cabarets get away with stuff that\r\nwould land their owners in the clink in New York, but there seems to be\r\nno police control or regulation of acts.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Billie Holiday, the Negro singer who has served time on\r\nnarcotics and prostitution falls, is barred from New York night clubs\r\nthrough the ukase of the Police License Bureau, which fingerprints all\r\nentertainers and thumbs those with records out of town. But while this\r\nwas being written, Miss Holiday was starring in Washington’s Brown\r\nDerby.\r\n\r\nWashington caters to visiting theatrical celebrities. Hollywood stars,\r\nto whom the capital spells spotlight, are flattered by attentions of\r\npoliticians who, in return for free shows and broadcasts, flatter them.\r\nThis racket was invented by President Roosevelt, and, ever since,\r\ntheatrical headliners have been welcome luncheon and dinner guests\r\nat the White House. In Washington they generally stay at one of the\r\nfive leading hotels and may be found dining or drinking in the lounges\r\nand restaurants of the Mayflower, Carlton, Statler, Shoreham and\r\nWardman Park. Autograph collecting is not a highly developed hobby in\r\nWashington; but some juvenile half-wits plant themselves outside the\r\nhotels when such celebs are in town.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing the equivalent of Morocco, 21, Colony, Stork, or Toots\r\nShor’s. The Mayflower lounge, nicknamed “The Snake Pit,” is that--the\r\nmad gathering-place at cocktail time for the local celebs: the\r\nSenators, lobbyists, army brass and blondest cuties.\r\n\r\nMost Washington night-life is as flat as those who patronize it. The\r\nheadwaiters are off the beam. The major-domo of the Wardman Park’s\r\nCaribar, typical of most of the town’s, is so provincial he doesn’t\r\nknow he could get rich trying to cater to the few spenders that stumble\r\nin. We watched him a whole evening and didn’t see him snare a buck.\r\n\r\nPatrons of Washington supper-clubs are lousy tippers. Most smalltown\r\nAmericans adhere to a strict ten percent. When they think they can get\r\naway with it, they stiff even that. Captains, headwaiters, cigaret gals\r\nand retiring-room attendants they ignore. Southerners are worse.\r\n\r\nWe were twitting one Senator from a border state about the free\r\nhaircuts the tax-payers provide for the members of the upper house in\r\ntheir private barber shop. This Senator replied, in all seriousness,\r\n“It’s almost cheaper to go outside. When you get it for nothing, you\r\ngotta tip the barber.”\r\n\r\nThe best palm-warmers are South American diplomats, who apparently have\r\nno regard for American money. Lobbyists, who like to flash big bills,\r\nespecially when they are entertaining impressionable legislators, run\r\nfor place.\r\n\r\nFew Washington waiters deserve much. The service they give is as\r\nterrible as the tips they don’t get.\r\n\r\nDance floors are crowded with jitterbugs. Rumbas never flowered in\r\nWashington. When a band plays one, flabbergasted hoofers try to jive to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFew clubs or rooms have rules against parties of unescorted women or\r\nstag men. If they did, they’d starve. It is not unusual to see half\r\nthe tables in any room surrounded by all males or all females. The\r\nlarger popular-priced clubs have signs on the tables reading, “Dancing\r\npermitted with your escort only.” This is a dead letter, or there\r\nwouldn’t be any dancers.\r\n\r\nPrices are cheap compared with Gotham’s. A few hotels impose cover\r\ncharges when they book expensive name acts.\r\n\r\nNo room has more than one band, which plays both for the show and\r\nthe dancing. During intermissions, the silence is broken by noisy\r\ndrunks. Like all towns with early closing, people get loaded early. In\r\nWashington serious guzzling begins at cocktail time. Many of those who\r\ndrink are oafs who don’t know how to hold their hooch.\r\n\r\nMost Washington saloon-goers are ill-mannered. On Saturday nights, when\r\nthe last round is announced at 11:45, many arise as one and walk out,\r\neven in the middle of an act.\r\n\r\nWashington has no cafe society. Its gathering places are\r\nutilitarian--for foods and drinks. No warm camaraderie, no light good\r\nfellowship, no wit, no animation. Corny commoners in stereotyped\r\nsurroundings. Peoria on the Potomac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21. CALL ME MADAM\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a brief brush-off of the social parvenus who scrambled up as\r\nSociety scrammed out--through death and Democratic administration.\r\n\r\nFaded and forgotten are the days and nights when Washington was ablaze\r\nwith social brilliance and the gossip behind the fans reflected the\r\nsturdy foibles and feuds and infidelities of a class in superior strata\r\nof lineage, wealth and those graces which cannot be acquired with\r\nsudden fortune.\r\n\r\nSociety is always the shadow of one luminous, scintillant, predominant\r\nwoman, such as Mrs. Potter Palmer was in Chicago and the dowager\r\nVanderbilt remained until senility denatured her in New York. In\r\nWashington that woman, even though she seldom entertains or permits\r\nherself to be entertained, must be the wife of the President. She\r\nneed not be a Dolly Madison. She can be a recluse, a Quaker like Mrs.\r\nHerbert Hoover; a New England villager, like Grace Coolidge; a grande\r\ndame like Mrs. Benjamin Harrison or an Ohio hick like Mrs. Warren\r\nHarding. But she is the undisputed ex officio queen bee of the social\r\nlife of the capital. She sets its tempo, she elevates with a nod and\r\nshe extirpates with a frown.\r\n\r\nFew Presidents’ wives would have won social preference had their\r\nhusbands not squirmed through the labyrinthian catacombs with that\r\nmiraculous luck which makes one man what they say any American boy can\r\nbecome. But once he takes that oath, his lady assumes a crown. Whether\r\nshe chooses to wear it or not, she can and must exercise its power over\r\nher realm, Society.\r\n\r\nAnd Society withstood the hostesses of gentlemen, soldiers,\r\nbackwoodsmen, a sheriff, a tailor, a school-teacher, a rail-splitter\r\nand a Buchanan. But it could not survive Eleanor Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nHere came a woman of blood and millions, married to an equally\r\nhigh-bred, landed manor squire, perhaps the most charming and dynamic\r\nand handsome of all our Presidents. And the first tap of her flat heels\r\nacross the White House threshold led off the funeral march of Society\r\nin the capital.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to review her attitude and behavior; no First Lady\r\nwas ever so unendingly publicized. That she became invested with\r\ncertain homely and all-wooly virtues by the worship of millions is\r\nprecisely why she choked the last breath out of social tradition with\r\nher Negro friends, her boondoggling, sweaty indigents, her professional\r\nSocialists, her dedicated slum-house guardians of gutter garbage, and\r\nher antics as the militant apostle of democracy and equality. The\r\nbedrock of Society is inequality, the existence and recognition of an\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nWhether it is good or not for fundamental Americanism, it was as lethal\r\nto the remnants of a baronial stratum in Washington as the Emancipation\r\nProclamation was below the Mason and Dixon line.\r\n\r\nNo female in American history had ever been so despised in the\r\ndrawing-rooms and so venerated in the kitchens and furnished rooms. But\r\nthat hatred within the walls of the elegant was not enough to sustain\r\neven a social underground. A few dauntless matrons held out. They tried\r\nto continue executing the motions from memory, but they perished on the\r\ninglorious field of futility. They were the last. There were no wounded\r\nand no prisoners taken. A dynasty that had flourished for 150 years had\r\nbeen wiped out as were the Romanoffs.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely, Bess Truman was not sent from above for the Restoration.\r\n\r\nFrom the founding of the city until the recent demise of Evelyn Walsh\r\nMcLean, who owned the Hope Diamond, Washington was celebrated for its\r\nintrigue, romance and scandal in high Society.\r\n\r\nEleanor “Cissie” Patterson and Mrs. McLean were the last of the city’s\r\ngreat hostesses. Mrs. Patterson retired from the tea-table wars when\r\nshe became active in newspaper work. With her death, and that of Mrs.\r\nMcLean, the Washington Society pages were taken over by the climbers.\r\n\r\nOne needs no long memory to remember when social leaders from\r\neverywhere converged on this city. Dupont Circle was Fifth Avenue\r\nrefined and rarefied, the cream of established snobbery, wealth,\r\nofficialdom and diplomacy.\r\n\r\nAmbitious minglers from the Middle West, such as the Pullmans, the\r\nLeiters and others, bypassed New York’s fatuous 400 and came directly\r\nto Washington.\r\n\r\nSocial history there begins with beauteous Elizabeth Patterson, of\r\nBaltimore, who wed Napoleon’s younger brother. Its first tasty scandal\r\nwas whispered in Jefferson’s time, about the French Ambassador who was\r\nreputed to have married his jailer’s daughter, who had saved him from\r\nthe guillotine.\r\n\r\nEarly Washington Society was titillated by duels among high personages.\r\nThe duel on the Hudson shore in which Alexander Hamilton was killed\r\nby Aaron Burr, in 1804, was talked about for years, until 1820, when\r\na new gory sensation arose to take its place: the mortal wounding of\r\nCommodore Stephen Decatur in an arranged meeting of gentlemen across\r\nthe District line in Maryland.\r\n\r\nAfter a hundred years, Washington still talks about Peggy Eaton and\r\nPresident Jackson’s Kitchen Cabinet. But, today’s mundane morsels will\r\nmake no interesting reading, leave no spice for the raconteur.\r\n\r\nSociety is on the wane everywhere. Taxes, Communist and New Deal\r\npropaganda, the high cost of living, make it virtually impossible to\r\nkeep up huge menages. Now only rich labor leaders, black marketeers,\r\ngangsters and grafters can afford the expense.\r\n\r\nThere are a handful of rich dowagers like Mrs. Jay Borden Harriman and\r\nMrs. Gifford Pinchot, but they are out of the running.\r\n\r\nCornelia Pinchot only entertains the “intellectuals,” and they are\r\nlegion in Washington. Where you find an intellectual in the District\r\nyou will probably find a Red. Mrs. Pinchot does not know it, but the\r\nCommies have taken the elderly hostess over and are making hay with her\r\nname.\r\n\r\nShe lives in a Gay Nineties mansion on Scott Circle, where she often\r\nthrows parties for the National Association for the Advancement of\r\nColored People, attended by white and colored college professors,\r\npansies and political economists. Mrs. Pinchot looks her age, though\r\nher hair is dyed the most amazing shade of carrot-red.\r\n\r\nMrs. Robert Low Bacon, the hostess of the Republican intellectuals,\r\nrarely hits the gossip columns. Even Evie Robert and her mother, Mrs.\r\nHelen Walker, have been dormant for years. Evie, the wife of “Chip”\r\nRobert, a brilliant political wire-puller, does not and never did\r\ngive parties for social advantage. They were to advance the political\r\nprospects of her husband.\r\n\r\nToday’s Washington Society has no class levels. All you need is dough\r\nand the urge and the energy to spend it on freeloaders. If you can snag\r\nmore important political people to your parties in any one calendar\r\nseason, from October to May, than your neighbor, you are Number 1\r\nsocial leader, regardless of whether you wore shoes before you were\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\nPerle Mesta, a determined hostess who was lucky enough to have been\r\ngracious to Harry Truman when he was a secondary Senator from Missouri,\r\nis living proof of the potency of the Washington cocktail party. Her\r\nreward was the appointment as Minister to Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Mesta is by no means the only social climber in Washington,\r\nthough she is and was the most publicized.\r\n\r\nWe would like to tell you about Mrs. Gussie (Gushie) Goodwin, formerly\r\na Chicagoan. She is the wife of Federal Judge Clarence Norton Goodwin,\r\nwho sentenced Harry Bridges in the Communist leader’s first round\r\nbefore the courts. They were friends of the Woodrow Wilsons, which gave\r\nthem some kind of claim to social standing. Meanwhile, Judge Goodwin\r\nstarted to go deaf, which handicapped him as a social figure. Gussie’s\r\nstar was setting.\r\n\r\nThen came a turn to her fortunes. She met a charming Latin gentleman,\r\nRamon Ramos, at a cocktail melee. He was a professor of Spanish. Gussie\r\ngot an inspiration. She was going to cement Latin-American relations\r\nand her own social relations. She started a private class. Her little\r\nstudy group met once a week at her home. During the first year, there\r\nwere eight women in it, each of whom chipped in a buck towards the\r\nprofessor’s fee.\r\n\r\nGussie began calling the wives of the more important officials and\r\nSenators, and invited them to join her group. She was very careful to\r\nsee that it was equally divided between Republicans and Democrats.\r\nOne of the ladies who gladly became a member was the wife of Senator\r\nHarry Truman. After the Trumans succeeded to the White House, the\r\nSecret Service wouldn’t allow Mrs. Truman to go to the lessons at\r\nGussie’s house, so all the meetings were moved to the White House,\r\nthough Gussie continued to be its leading spirit. Mrs. Goodwin was very\r\noffish. When Dean Acheson resigned as Undersecretary of State, his wife\r\nwas not asked back.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Professor Ramos showed he had hidden talents. His hobby\r\nis cooking. The ladies were charmed. So an extra feature was added.\r\nEach week the program was expanded to include a luncheon, held at a\r\ndifferent woman’s house. The Professor masterminded the menu, while the\r\nladies did the cooking and waited on the others. Mrs. Truman came to\r\nthese parties and pitched in with the work. The luncheons were run on a\r\nDutch treat basis, and each woman continued to pay her dollar fee per\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nBy this time there were sixty or seventy ladies in the group, including\r\ngood Queen Bess. Some took private Spanish lessons on the side. Mrs.\r\nTruman was one of the few who was really serious and wanted to learn\r\nthe language. Most of the others apparently came to the meetings\r\nbecause the Professor had the personality to hold “menopause Minnies.”\r\nAmong the students were a few who thought they should come along for\r\nthe ride without paying for lessons or the luncheon, because of their\r\nsocial position. One was Mrs. Robert Patterson, wife of the then\r\nSecretary of War. Mrs. Truman always paid.\r\n\r\nWhen the Professor began to get too much publicity, Gussie busted it\r\nup. After all, the whole purpose was to make Gussie a figure, not the\r\nProfessor. Gussie even went so far as to ask newspaper society writers\r\nto use her name instead of his, saying Mrs. Truman had complained about\r\nthe Professor’s publicity, which was not accurate.\r\n\r\nAnyway, no one learned much, but that wasn’t the Prof’s fault.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Madame Mesta, Gwendolyn Cafritz is ballyhooed as\r\nWashington’s leading hostess. She is a social climber who invites only\r\nthose in office or who she thinks are due to be in. She sadly misjudged\r\nthe 1948 elections. She excommunicated the Democrats. So she had a\r\nhell of a time recouping her position. She still has her eye on the\r\nRepublicans in 1952.\r\n\r\nCompared to Madame Mesta, Mrs. Cafritz is a good-looking woman, in\r\nearly middle age. She may have been a raving beauty when she was a\r\nslim, black-haired girl.\r\n\r\nHer husband, Morris Cafritz, is a millionaire Washington real estate\r\nowner. His office, in the Ambassador Hotel, which he owns, is next\r\ndoor to the hotel’s High Hat cocktail lounge, which is favored by the\r\npick-up gals as a hunting preserve. Gwen drives her husband slightly\r\nnuts with her parties. He would prefer to play poker, at which he is\r\nadept. A lot of hogwash has been written about the Cafritzes since they\r\nzoomed into political and social prominence. Gwen was born in central\r\nEurope and may or may not have been the daughter of a college professor\r\nor a nobleman, as the stories go.\r\n\r\nCafritz’s father ran a grocery store in Washington. The son’s early\r\ndays were spent in a bowling alley which he owned and operated. Then he\r\nturned to real estate in boomtime and found the Midas touch.\r\n\r\nGwen’s enemies spread catty stories about her. One says she was a\r\nBroadway chorus-girl before she met her husband. If she was, she\r\nmust’ve been a beaut. The other is that she was employed in Cafritz’s\r\nbowling alley. The researcher finds it difficult to separate the truth\r\nfrom the chaff. There are no clippings about her early days in the\r\nWashington newspaper morgues. Cissie Patterson was her close friend. It\r\nis reported she destroyed the clippings in her own library and asked\r\nthe publishers of Washington’s other papers to do likewise.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mmes. Mesta and Cafritz had better look to their laurels,\r\nbecause a new assault is being made on Washington’s social citadel,\r\nthis time by a bullet-proof princess--Tawhida Halim, a cousin of King\r\nFarouk of Egypt, and immensely rich. She and Frank Rediker, a denizen\r\nof Gotham’s cafe society set, were recently wed, repeat engagements for\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nThe princess then acquired a mansion at 2339 Massachusetts Avenue, in\r\nwhich she and her bridegroom began to give lavish parties, designed to\r\noutdo any of the Cafritz woman’s, with the elan that goes only to those\r\nborn to the purple.\r\n\r\n(_INSIDE STUFF_: The Redikers’ social campaign is being managed by\r\nLeonard McBain, elegant publicist and society arbiter of New York’s\r\nplush El Morocco, where the snootiest people on earth gather. Leonard\r\nhas steered royalty before. He could do marvels for Tawhida.)\r\n\r\nSince the old aristocrats died or went into hiding, it is easier to get\r\ninto Washington’s society columns, if you care to horn in with inferior\r\nwhite trash.\r\n\r\nAlmost anyone, including justices of the United States Supreme Court,\r\nwill go to any party to which they are invited. Many who aren’t invited\r\nwill also show up. The trick nowadays is to entertain lavishly and\r\noften, and sooner or later the papers will have to write about you,\r\nbecause there is nothing else to write about.\r\n\r\nAmbitious hostesses buy the “Social List of Washington, D.C.,” and\r\ninvite names from it at random. The odds are 90 percent will show up,\r\nbut the odds are as high that 95 percent of the 90 per cent aren’t\r\nsocial. This list competes with the standard “Social Register.” It\r\ncontains most of the names in the latter, plus an amplification\r\nconsisting of prominent politicians and diplomats. It is published by\r\nCarolyn Hagner Shaw. Mrs. Shaw told us a “board” selects the candidates\r\nfor entry in the book. The board, however, is highly secret. One\r\nWashington newspaper insists it is as mythical as the balanced budget.\r\nMrs. Shaw claims no one ever tells her why a name is added or dropped.\r\n\r\nIf you thought Maj. Gen. Harry Vaughan was part of the _crème de la\r\ncrème_ of the Washington social whirl, you’d better change your mind.\r\nHe isn’t any more. Not if you take the word of Mrs. Shaw. She omits the\r\nmilitary aide to the President from her fancy green directory of the\r\nsocially prominent. Mrs. Shaw doesn’t know why General Vaughan isn’t\r\nsocially correct any more. She blamed it on the anonymous board.\r\n\r\nAbout 200 who sought to make the list were turned down. Again no\r\nreasons given. Many bought copies at 12 bucks, hoping to see their\r\nnames in. They didn’t.\r\n\r\nHowever, Guy George Gabrielson and William Marshall Boyle, respective\r\nchairmen of the Republican and Democratic National Committees, were\r\namong the new names added this year. The book also has the _dernier\r\ncri_ on what to do about cards. They should not be left at Blair House,\r\nbut given to the guard at the northwest gate of the White House.\r\n\r\n“A courtesy call should be made on the President and his family once a\r\nyear. This is a mark of respect that should not be neglected.” (This\r\nwas before two Puerto Rican enthusiasts tried it.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Shaw reminds her readers “During World War II, formal observance\r\nof the conventional days set aside for leaving cards on various\r\nofficials was canceled. A return to formal recognition of these\r\ntraditional days has yet to take place, and it is doubtful that it will\r\never again become obligatory to leave cards on certain days.”\r\n\r\nAs to protocol, it notes: “It is well to remember personal friendships\r\ndo not count. The rank of one’s guest must be the deciding factor.”\r\n\r\nIf you are not sure of the comparative ranking of any guest, it is\r\nbetter not to invite him. Many of the biggest social wars were caused\r\nby such things. Still remembered is the feud between Alice Roosevelt\r\nLongworth, then wife of the Speaker of the House, and Dolly Gann,\r\nsister and hostess of Vice-President Curtis, over their respective\r\nprecedence.\r\n\r\nOfficials and embassies receive advice on protocol matter from the\r\nState Department, but non-official hostesses are on their own. Mrs.\r\nShaw supplies a service which gives assistance in seating.\r\n\r\nAn important fixture in Washington is the debutante party. These\r\nhave almost disappeared in New York, where each year’s crop of young\r\nhopefuls is introduced in a mass get-together. In Washington, the\r\ngirl who doesn’t get a dinner-dance on her own is a social slob.\r\nWashington’s Elsa Maxwell for these parties is Mrs. Curt Hetzel, who\r\nsucceeded Mrs. Merriam. Mr. Hetzel is a pianist in a restaurant--Ted\r\nLewis’. Mary Stuart Price, a young woman, handles some debby parties as\r\na sideline.\r\n\r\nClub life is another sacred institution. Many important political\r\ndecisions are reached at such places as the Burning Tree Club, the\r\nChevy Chase Club, and the Sulgrave, famous for the McCarthy-Pearson\r\nbattle of the century--more maybe than in the Senate and the House\r\ncloakrooms. The 1925 F Street Club, where ranking members of the\r\nSenate give parties, was once the exclusive home of Mrs. Laura Curtis\r\nGross, who lent her house for parties. It is now a sanctuary for the\r\nwhipped-cream of Washington society. Its dining-room seats about 60 and\r\nthe club’s membership is strictly limited.\r\n\r\nWashington’s newest aristocracy is evidenced by stone piles. The wife\r\nof the man who can build the biggest and plushiest office building is\r\nthe reigning social leader.\r\n\r\nThose currently with the highest batting average are Morris Cafritz, of\r\ncourse, Gus Ring, Garfield Cass and Preston Wire, all with gleaming new\r\nstructures named after themselves. Much of the money of the real estate\r\n_nouveau riche_ came from wise investments in Black Belt housing, or\r\nfrom refugee sources.\r\n\r\nUntil very recent years the august justices of the United States\r\nSupreme Court remained aloof from social functions, but during the\r\ndays of the New Deal and Fair Deal, when the court was packed with\r\nsoft-shirted politicians, the custom changed. Judges like Douglas are\r\navid party-goers. The late Frank Murphy was a mixer with true CIO\r\ndeportment, a hoofer and Saturday night sport. The result is that the\r\nopening of the fall season is now coincident with the convening of\r\nthe Supreme Court. Then the jurists can meet the typists and clink\r\ncocktails with mobsters’ mouthpieces.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get into what is called “society” is to be elected\r\nor appointed into it. Every ex-cow-puncher, dirt-farmer, smalltown\r\nlawyer and big-city ward-heeler who now has an “Honorable” in front of\r\nhis name is as social as those who were born into it, bought their way\r\nin, or got in through a diplomatic passport.\r\n\r\nAll 96 Senators and 435 Representatives, nine cabinet officers,\r\ncountless under-secretaries, assistant secretaries, judges, department\r\nheads and military brass are social, with a listing in the directory,\r\nthough some never wore ties or socks until they got to Washington.\r\nThese ex-officio lions became the life of the party in 1933.\r\n\r\nWashington once thrived on dirt in high places. Grover Cleveland’s\r\nbastard child didn’t interfere with his electoral or social standing.\r\nNor was Woodrow Wilson ruined when a certain lady was booted out of\r\nWashington by the Secret Service. President Harding’s house on K Street\r\nis still remembered. There’s nothing like it now. And his village\r\nsweetie and her baby have vanished. President Truman’s poker games are\r\npenny-ante, not the lusty ones of yore.\r\n\r\nThe late Roosevelt administration is credited with more snappy spice\r\nthan any other in history. Out-of-school tales were told about most of\r\nhis children. The President and his wife were not spared by gossipers.\r\nBut President Truman’s personal life is treated as dull and austere.\r\n\r\nHis advisers are farmers or aging professors. They were pirates in the\r\nfirst Roosevelt decade. The sports, drinkers and rounders who held high\r\ncabinet and military rank then are either gone or too old. Now most\r\nofficial vice is grubby stuff, with call-girls supplied by a protected\r\nvice-ring, about which nothing is ever heard, and which no Congressman\r\nor Senator will admit he knows.\r\n\r\nPresident Truman’s pal, General Harry Vaughan, is comparatively quiet\r\nnow, held to mama’s apron-strings. There’s gambling for him and the\r\nPresident in the White House. There’s no liquor shortage, either. The\r\nPresident likes his bourbon. He never smokes. He will not countenance\r\nwhoring in his official family, though he doesn’t put detectives on\r\nofficial tails.\r\n\r\nProbably the only real sport in town is Senator Warren Magnuson.\r\nThe others save their skylarking for New York. When they do it in\r\nWashington, they are as frightened as schoolboys at it, and often as\r\nunimaginative.\r\n\r\nWhat a change from the Roosevelt days, when sex was the prerogative\r\nof all government officials, and usually paid for by the grateful\r\ntax-payers! Uncle Sam even had to help Harry Hopkins do it. A\r\nmonkey-gland doctor grafted sex virility on Hopkins and two other\r\naging administration stalwarts, one of whom recently resigned from a\r\nlittle-cabinet post.\r\n\r\nThe doctor billed the wealthiest of the three $3,000 for each\r\ntreatment. He charged the other two $1,000. Hopkins had already stiffed\r\nthe medico for three operations when he asked for the fourth, in view\r\nof his pending marriage to a young woman. The doctor’s verdict was no\r\nmoney, no honeymoon. But Hopkins had a way out. He suggested the doctor\r\nneeded a vacation anyway, so he offered to get him an appointment to\r\nmake an inspection trip to army medical bases in the West Indies,\r\nwith all expenses paid for self and wife, plus $35 a day fee until\r\nthe $3,000 was paid. The doctor took the trip and Hopkins took the\r\nhoneymoon.\r\n\r\nHigh military brass is quiet today compared to the lusty generals and\r\nadmirals of the ’20s and ’30s. Washington is still talking about how\r\nGeneral Pershing, then chief of staff, ordered young General Douglas\r\nMacArthur to the Philippines after MacArthur married Mrs. Louise\r\nCromwell Brooks, of the Philadelphia Stotesbury clan. Mrs. Brooks,\r\nafter her divorce from her first husband, met “Black Jack” Pershing\r\nabroad. When she returned to America, she became his official hostess\r\nin Washington. She was 25 to his 60. Two months after their wedding,\r\nin 1922, the MacArthurs were shipped to the Philippines. Washington\r\ncats said Pershing sent his successful young rival into exile to get\r\neven. He had also exiled the captain of the Army polo team, who was\r\nattentive to the rich, beautiful Louise. She is now Mrs. Alf Heiberg,\r\nthe proud owner of Washington’s only private atom-bomb shelter, which\r\nshe constructed under her Georgetown Mansion.\r\n\r\nThe late General of the Armies, a widower, was quite a man with the\r\nwomen. He kept a Roumanian babe and her mother at the Shoreham Hotel\r\nfor 20 years.\r\n\r\n“Thirty” was written to Washington Society when a local paper fired its\r\nsocial editor because she refused to print the names of Negro hostesses!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22. STRIPED PANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nElsewhere, men who wear them bury the dead; here, most of those who\r\nwear them are dead but not buried.\r\n\r\nThe decadence of the diplomats ran parallel with the fadeout of\r\nsociety, though not for the same causes. Continental and cosmopolitan\r\nlife on Embassy Row was a war casualty.\r\n\r\nThe democratization and bolshevization of Europe turned their\r\nextra-territorial domains here into tawdry outhouses reflecting\r\nmonarchies and empires riddled into busted republics and dictatorships,\r\neither scrabbling for the necessities of life or committed to the\r\npolitical policy of shabby proletarianism.\r\n\r\nThe kings are no longer king. The courts of Vienna, Berlin, Moscow,\r\nMadrid, Rome, and of the giddy little Balkan states are now the\r\nheadquarters of Labor Parties and worse. The crowned heads of England,\r\nThe Netherlands and the Scandinavian kingdoms are kept figureheads.\r\nDiplomatic display is a sin against poverty and the world rash for\r\nunilateral social and economic status.\r\n\r\nThere is not an embassy in Washington which does not cost far more than\r\nit did 20 years ago. That is because they have become workhouses where\r\nthe press of international business is sordid and tremendous. Gone are\r\nthe Thursday and Friday open-house hospitalities and grand balls in\r\nTechnicolor, animated by gowns and costumes and uniforms of galaxies of\r\nall nations.\r\n\r\n“These are difficult and different days,” the deans of diplomacy sigh.\r\n\r\nThe old spirit has vanished not only from the governments, but from\r\ntheir representatives, who are living close to the vest, hoarding\r\nprecious American dollars against revolution or overturn by popular\r\nvote of their countries. Ambassadors and Ministers are salting away\r\nwhat they can skim off in Black Belt real estate, farms and U. S.\r\nsecurities. Some go much further. They are actual dealers in American\r\ngoods which they can procure and can send home free of import duty to\r\ntheir countries. At the same time they blackmarket merchandise here,\r\nwhere they can buy liquor, cigarettes, cosmetics and other excised\r\nproducts free of internal revenue tax. For the best whiskey and\r\nchampagne they pay $13 a case.\r\n\r\nDuring Prohibition, a small Central American legation was actively in\r\nthe rum-running business, importing huge quantities under diplomatic\r\nimmunity, then reselling to Jack Cunningham, a local bootlegger. One\r\nday rival gangsters caught up with Cunningham in an alley in I Street,\r\nand there he was knocked off. The killing was hushed up. It would have\r\ninvolved too many untouchables.\r\n\r\nThese business opportunities and the degree of austerity which is still\r\nlight as compared with most of the globe--all of it except Canada and\r\nSouth America--have made Washington the choice diplomatic plum, in\r\nplace of London and its Court of St. James’.\r\n\r\nThe diplomats here are timid, precise and industrious. They are fearful\r\nof a false step which might mean recall, for here they are saving\r\nagainst eventual retirement. But their caution cannot withstand their\r\ngreed and some smuggle dope in via their sealed and search-proof\r\nofficial pouches. They have discovered the glories of the American\r\ninstallment plan and buy not only land and houses, but cars and\r\nmechanical gadgets unobtainable at home. If they are transferred they\r\nrent out their properties here, which, in the only currency still\r\nreasonably dependable, makes them rich wherever they go, even into\r\nexile.\r\n\r\nAnother factor which helps reduce the gaiety and glamor of Washington\r\ndiplomatic life is the competing diplomatic corps accredited to the\r\nUnited Nations, in New York. It is gradually getting the ace publicity\r\nbreaks.\r\n\r\nThe question of sex looms big on the agenda of every ambassador. He\r\nprefers all his aides married, with wives in residence, so they will\r\ncreate no scandal. Many of the younger members of the various staffs,\r\nwith modest jobs and salaries, are bachelors. These men are usually\r\nforbidden, under pain of being sent home, to fool around with women in\r\nWashington. Their chiefs, from time to time, order them to go to New\r\nYork “to have a party.”\r\n\r\nIf the press of business is too great to allow for long weekends, when\r\nthe ambassador notes that the young men on his staff are getting hot\r\nbritches he sends them to Baltimore, where they are unknown and nothing\r\nis barred.\r\n\r\nAmbassadors, themselves, and senior diplomats with roving eyes, are\r\ntaken care of by the Protocol Division of the State Department, which\r\nalso handles the sex problems of visiting foreign brass. That’s a\r\njob for specialists. There are so few girls in Washington glamorous\r\nenough to satisfy VIPs. Sometimes it is not politic to have them\r\nassociate with local talent anyway, because of its tieups. So the State\r\nDepartment has compiled a list of amiable New York models, willing to\r\ncome to Washington to spend a night with a foreign dignitary. They\r\nget $200 a night and expenses, from “contingent funds” coming out\r\nof the pockets of the American tax-payers. They are provided on an\r\nancient reciprocity custom, in exchange for girls supplied to American\r\njunketeers who flit abroad.\r\n\r\nThis privilege is avidly utilized by American Senators, Congressmen and\r\nother officials, and is one reason why so many find it necessary so\r\noften to fly to Europe, Asia and South America at government expense.\r\nOne prominent Republican solon, who never cheats in Washington, was\r\nshown such a good time by a French babe supplied by the Quai d’Orsay,\r\nhe ended up in a Paris hospital for five days and has been a sick man\r\never since.\r\n\r\nWhen the State Department procures women for foreign dignitaries,\r\nthey are given security and VD tests. It is easy to see how delicate\r\ndiplomatic relations might be ruptured by a microcosmic thunderclap.\r\n\r\nMany embassies have their own “company- and party-girl” lists. They\r\ndo not always want the State Department to know what they are doing.\r\nThere’s a girl named Mary Karrica, 1471 M Street, NW, who furnishes\r\nthem to the diplomatic corps.\r\n\r\nOne of the major problems of such dialectics for the State Department’s\r\nbright boys arises when a visiting notable plans to tour the country\r\nand doesn’t plan to sleep alone. Protocol then makes contacts through\r\nlocal police departments, which are expected to know the best\r\ncall-house madames in their own towns.\r\n\r\nWhen the young Shah of Persia visited America a couple of years ago,\r\nthe State Department had no trouble furnishing desirable girls for him\r\nin Hollywood and Chicago; but in New York, where he wanted a blonde\r\nthat night, they had to get him a Powers model. Apparently his majesty\r\nliked it, because the next day he gave her an emerald worth $20,000.\r\nThe guy from the State Department who told us about this sighed, “But\r\nthe bitch still took our $200!”\r\n\r\nYears ago, when Italo Balbo made his triumphal tour of the country, he\r\nturned his nose up at showgals and screen stars. The Italian air ace\r\ninsisted on one from the Social Register. The Navy was in charge of\r\nentertaining him. Some of its younger attachés dug up a semi-society\r\nbabe from Chicago, who was willing to take a fling with the Italian\r\naviator. The Navy had no dough for the purpose, so the young officers\r\nchipped in $300 to buy her a watch, and told her it was from Balbo. Now\r\na graying middle-aged woman, she still prizes the watch “given to her\r\nby the dashing Italian.”\r\n\r\nMost foreigners are discreet. Little rough stuff seeps out of the\r\nembassies. The Washington newspapers cover Embassy Row--there are\r\ntwo--16th Street and Massachusetts Avenue--but usually give their\r\nreaders stories about cocktail parties, dances and weddings, instead of\r\nsnappy copy.\r\n\r\nBeing confidential reporters we did not go through the front doors.\r\nWhat we know is mostly backstairs buzz, out of the kitchens and garages\r\nof the following embassies:\r\n\r\nARGENTINA--The Embassy, at 1815 Q Street, provided Washington with\r\none of its liveliest tidbits. The real lowdown has not been divulged\r\nbefore. We got this out of confidential Congressional files, where the\r\ninformation was testified to under oath.\r\n\r\nNina Lund, niece of ex-Senator White, of Maine, was one of Washington’s\r\nloveliest and most popular dishes. Her husband, Nathaniel Lautrelle, a\r\nlocal department store executive, suspected her frequent absences from\r\nhome were not to go to the beauty parlor, so he and three men, whom he\r\nengaged, followed her to 3030 O Street, NW. Those with Lautrelle were\r\nLt. Joseph Shimon, wire-tap expert of the Metropolitan Police who was\r\nrecently under Congressional investigation; Joseph Mercurio, a dope\r\naddict and locksmith, and James Karas, former Pinkerton agent, who\r\nnow operates the flower-shop in the Mayflower Hotel. Mercurio sprung\r\nthe lock on Apartment 2 and the four entered. They found Nina and an\r\nArgentine Ambassador naked.\r\n\r\nShimon got five grand for his service. Lautrelle and Nina got a\r\ndivorce. The Ambassador, sent here originally because Eva Peron fancied\r\nhim, went back to Argentina for consultation.\r\n\r\nBut they have something else to occupy their minds these days. Many\r\nemployes and upper attachés of the Argentine Embassy are feathering\r\ntheir futures by shipping electric refrigerators home, packed as\r\npersonal household furniture.\r\n\r\nThis is simple, as it is not unusual for diplomats to buy enough\r\npersonal furniture in the country of their station to furnish their\r\nhomes. Hundreds of refrigerators can be packed into such cases, and\r\neach so smuggled brings a premium of $100 in American currency, worth\r\nten times that in Argentine currency black markets.\r\n\r\nBRAZIL--Hospitality in the Embassy, at 3000 Massachusetts Avenue, is in\r\nthe best old-fashioned tradition. The Ambassador, Mauricio Nabuco, is a\r\nbachelor. His hostess is his sister, Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador is one of Washington’s best hosts. He constantly\r\nentertains at large formal affairs and at intimate gatherings to which\r\nstatesmen, musicians and poets are invited. No scandal attaches to the\r\nAmbassador, but he likes to have pretty women around him. Maybe that’s\r\nwhy he entertains so much. One 18-year old cutie told us, “Oh, the old\r\nguy is harmless.”\r\n\r\nCHINA--There’s little gaiety as we write, in the Embassy at 3225\r\nWoodley Road. But things were not always so. As witness:\r\n\r\nCongressman Hale, of Maine (Rep.), is a short, white-haired, pompous\r\ngent, heavy with dignity. Not long ago he attended a formal affair at\r\nthe Chinese Embassy.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a woman came up behind him and “goosed” him. The legislator’s\r\ndignity exploded with a scream. He turned around to confront his\r\ntormentor. The embarrassed lady apologized. “Oh--I’m sorry--I thought\r\nyou were someone else!”\r\n\r\nA good-looking, well-knit young man, employed by one of the government\r\nagencies, was showering in the bathroom of the YMCA, where he lived,\r\nsome years ago.\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of his eye he saw another man in the room, but\r\nthought nothing of it, as the bathroom is public.\r\n\r\nWhen he came out of the shower the other was fixedly staring at him.\r\nOur friend grew embarrassed, and was not especially put at ease by the\r\nother’s appearance. He was an elderly Oriental.\r\n\r\nOur friend inquired what was doing. The Oriental, in a singsong voice,\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“You like go bed with rich Chinee lady?”\r\n\r\nThe chap was going to bop the guy, but first he tried to find out what\r\nit was all about It developed that a high-placed woman in the Embassy\r\nliked American boys, sent her servant to recruit them in places like\r\nthe Y, after having them looked over. What a switch on the oldie about\r\n“Is it true what they say about Chinese women?”\r\n\r\nThe son of a famous Protestant clergyman worked for the Maritime\r\nCommission, where he became friendly with the commercial attachés of\r\nmany countries. He found some would take loot. This troubled him. He\r\ndiscussed it with an older man who had a desk in the same office.\r\n\r\nThis older fellow used to run errands for Lepke and Gurrah and their\r\nfamed Murder, Inc. After Bill O’Dwyer destroyed the ring, he got a job\r\nwith Uncle Sam.\r\n\r\nHe advised the young fellow to grab what he could while the grabbing\r\nwas good. So the minister’s son became the bagman for several embassies.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Chinese bought some gunboats and let out word they\r\nwere in the market for repairs in American shipyards. The yards were in\r\na post-war depression, needed business. Immediately, representatives\r\ncalled at the Chinese embassy. An official there, who spoke better\r\nEnglish than most of us, mumbled in pidgin and routed all inquiries to\r\n“the young man in the Maritime Commission, in whom we have implicit\r\nfaith.”\r\n\r\nThe young fellow collected more than half a million in cash as the\r\ngo-between, then beat it with the loot.\r\n\r\nDENMARK--Ambassador Henrick de Kauffman and his family are so proper it\r\nhurts. The Embassy, at 2839 Woodland Drive, is like a morgue.\r\n\r\nEGYPT--They are still laughing at this at 2301 Massachusetts Avenue. An\r\nEgyptian officer came to Washington recently on a buying mission. His\r\nembassy bespoke the American authorities to give him the A-1 treatment,\r\nthe best. The Navy boys took him to Charleston to see the ships and set\r\nhim up in style. The visitor wanted a blonde. But he was black, and\r\nCharleston is down South. This posed a problem. They finally found a\r\nwoman, but had to take her in through the back door.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian was insulted. He returned home without buying.\r\n\r\nFRANCE--No Parisian spice about the Henri Bonnets; however, there is\r\nno doubt the wife of a very exalted member of the staff is a Communist\r\ndrop and transmission belt.\r\n\r\nMme. Bonnet has family connections interested in the sale of Lanson\r\nchampagne. Important friends and guests pose with her, popping a bottle\r\nof the labeled bubble-water.\r\n\r\nLatest to fall for the publicity gag were Averell Harriman and his\r\nwife, photographed with Mme. Bonnet while opening a bottle of the\r\nchampagne. It got into all the papers.\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN--The embassy, at 3100 Massachusetts Avenue, under the\r\nRight Honorable Sir Oliver Shewell Franks, Knight Commander of the\r\nBath, C.B.E., and Lady Franks is as dull and austere as England itself.\r\nBut a former British Ambassador had as his lover his Russian valet.\r\n\r\nICELAND--Plenty of problems at the Icelandic legation. Lovely Margret\r\nThors, debutante daughter of Minister Thor Thors, got too friendly with\r\nthrice-divorced Blaine Clark, Washington playboy, so Ma and Pa packed\r\nher off to Iceland, where Clark couldn’t follow without a visa, which\r\nthe old man wouldn’t give. Margret promised to be a good girl and was\r\npermitted to return, but has to behave.\r\n\r\nIRAQ--As we write, Abdullah Ibraham Bakar, Iraqui minister, has a\r\nheadache. That’s because Cham Chum Sesi was arrested for murder in\r\nhis basement room of the Iraq Chancellory, 2205 Massachusetts Avenue.\r\nMuhmud Rodani, chief janitor, had been stabbed in the neck with a\r\nkitchen knife. Sesi told police he killed the janitor because he had\r\nmade repeated improper advances to him. The diplomatic set talked about\r\na lovers’ quarrel there when a new homo came from Iraq.\r\n\r\nNORWAY--The dean of the Washington Diplomatic Corps is Ambassador\r\nWilhelm Munthe de Morgenstierne. The Norwegian Embassy, 3401\r\nMassachusetts Avenue, generates no gossip.\r\n\r\nSAUDI ARABIA--This country is orthodox Mohammedan, goes in big for\r\npolygamy. The Ambassador, Sheikh Asad Al-Faquih, had no desire to\r\ninsult America by bringing extra wives with him, was afraid to affront\r\nhis wives by choosing one and leaving the others at home. The result\r\nis there are no women in the Embassy at 2800 Woodland Drive, or in the\r\nhomes of any of the attachés. When they want parties, they go to New\r\nYork, or to the State Department, where Protocol provides.\r\n\r\nSPAIN--America and Spain long exchanged no ambassadors. Don Eduardo\r\nPropper de Callejon, Spanish Minister, was nominally in charge of the\r\nEmbassy. The wily Spaniards got around having no ambassador here by\r\nsending Don Jose de Lequerica, former Foreign Minister, as “Inspector\r\nGeneral of all Spanish Embassies in the Western Hemisphere.” However,\r\nthe farthest he got from Washington since 1947 was Cuba.\r\n\r\nLequerica is a personality kid and a lobby genius. He entertains\r\nlavishly. His conniving paid off with the Spanish loan, and in time\r\nwith full recognition. Ambassador Lequerica had cultivated the law firm\r\nof Sullivan, Cromwell and Dulles, until the 1948 election returns were\r\nin and Dulles was out--as potential Secretary of State. He switched to\r\nMax Truitt, son-in-law of Vice President Barkley. Smart guy.\r\n\r\nMinister Propper de Callejon is married to an English Rothschild and is\r\nas proper as his name.\r\n\r\nSWEDEN--Ambassador and Mrs. Erik Boehman are no exception to the rule\r\nthat all Scandinavian embassies are tame and respectable. Theirs, at\r\n3900 Nebraska Avenue, is.\r\n\r\nTURKEY--The Turkish Ambassador, Feridun Cemal Erkin, insists on decorum\r\nin his Embassy at 1606 23rd Street. Turks there put on gloves and\r\nare fully clothed when they go to bed with their wives, an Orthodox\r\nMohammedan custom.\r\n\r\nUNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS--The Russians used to be the big\r\nspenders. Parties in the great white Embassy at 1125 16th Street were\r\nWashington’s most brilliant affairs. Invitations were eagerly sought\r\nafter. The Russian government paid all expenses of the Ambassador and\r\nhis staff, even bridge losses. The Russkies were terrific gamblers and\r\nfew locals could go along in games with them. Once when a Washington\r\nbusinessman was asked to play bridge at 25 cents a point he pleaded,\r\n“I’m only a capitalist, not a proletarian.”\r\n\r\nThere was always plenty of food and liquor in the Red retreat. All\r\nmembers of the local press corps were remembered with presents,\r\nespecially beluga caviar. But now the Russians don’t go out except to\r\nofficial functions, and that goes for their satellites, too. And they\r\ntravel only in pairs, one to spy on the other.\r\n\r\nThe Russians and their slave states bring their own females from\r\nabroad, because they’re afraid to trust American women, Communist ones\r\nincluded, any more. In the good old days, the consecrated American\r\nleft-wingers used to go to the Soviet Embassy, where they proved their\r\nparty loyalty by getting in the hay with the men from Moscow. After\r\nmany frightened American Reds got religion and betrayed the cause,\r\nSoviet diplomats were forbidden to Ostermoor with American women. This\r\ndid not cause too much hardship, because most American Communist women\r\nare no dream-girls; even the Russians shrank from them.\r\n\r\nAlmost every member of the embassy set has a wife or a concubine posing\r\nas a wife with him. In Russian Naval Headquarters, a few handsome young\r\norderlies are being used. There are said to be few homosexuals in\r\nRussia, where perversion is strictly punished, except for “Kremlin and\r\nworld revolution.”\r\n\r\nAs one humorist remarked, “There are no fags in Russia, because they\r\nlike goats; but where can they find goats in Washington?”\r\n\r\nAs a further check on their own people, members of the Soviet Embassy\r\nstaff are not permitted to live alone. Even couples must share\r\napartments with others.\r\n\r\nThe Russians have been getting special kid-gloving in Washington since\r\n1933, when the Embassy became the fashionable place to go. At Teheran,\r\nStalin asked President Roosevelt for permission to set up a shortwave\r\nradio transmitter in the U. S. to enable his boys to contact Moscow\r\ndirectly. Roosevelt sent a memo to General Marshall, instructing him\r\nto cooperate. Marshall wrote back that the law absolutely forbade any\r\nforeign government to maintain a transmitter in this country. F. D. R.\r\npenciled across it, “Do it anyway.”\r\n\r\nConsequently, an entire wing of the Pentagon was turned over to the\r\nCommies, where they sent over a million words a week. The President\r\nordered Military Intelligence not to try to break the Russian code, but\r\nsome officers took their oath to defend the Constitution literally,\r\nand overrode the President without his knowledge. As these words are\r\nbeing written, thugs of the NKVD are sitting 24 hours a day with\r\near-phones and transmitters in Russian Naval and Military headquarters\r\nat Massachusetts Avenue and Kalorama Road.\r\n\r\n                       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen an embassy wife isn’t worrying about a change in government at\r\nhome, which may mean the recall of her husband, she’s worrying about\r\ngetting her daughter properly married. A lot of the debutantes of\r\nthe embassy set are beginning to get American ideas after attending\r\nAmerican schools. The foreign aristocrats don’t like it.\r\n\r\nEmbassy wives have rarely been known to fool around. On the whole,\r\nembassy children behave themselves. When they don’t, they get packed\r\noff to schools in their own countries.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Iron Curtain diplomatic slums, there is\r\nconsiderable camaraderie among attachés of the various embassies,\r\nthough usually on equal strata. They go dancing in the hotels, visit\r\nat each other’s homes, ride and play golf together. Some time ago, an\r\nattempt was made to start a United Nations Club at R and 19th Streets,\r\nby Meredith Howard, who is the twin sister of Mrs. Teddy Hays. Hays, a\r\nbig Democrat and White House intimate, is assistant to Federal Security\r\nAdministrator Oscar Ewing, the socialized-medicine man. The idea was to\r\nget younger members of the embassies together, but it blew up when Miss\r\nHoward left town with no public explanation.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to con games, the diplomats and foreign missions could\r\nshow Yellow Kid Weil something.\r\n\r\nWashington and New York are constantly being dazzled by members of\r\nforeign missions who come here talking about purchases in hundreds of\r\nmillions (the dough to be put up by Uncle Sam).\r\n\r\nSalesmen, sure-thing boys and big executives turn on every tap to\r\nentertain the foreigners and grab their business.\r\n\r\nGirls are provided, expensive gifts are passed, and plenty of money\r\nchanges hands. Then, suddenly, the mission packs up, leaves without\r\nbuying, says it can’t find what it wants.\r\n\r\nCooks and butlers in every Washington embassy get kickbacks from the\r\nmerchants. Groceries, meats and other household goods are overpriced on\r\na regular scale for the embassies, with a rebate going monthly to the\r\naforementioned functionaries.\r\n\r\nLower-echelon foreigners have their wild parties in the Washington\r\nfield offices of the United Nations. There is no central installation\r\nof the international body in the capital, but offices are spread out\r\naround the town.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal places for after-work revelry is in the U.N.\r\noffices in the Longfellow Building, on Connecticut Avenue, where booze\r\nand babes are available every day after five.\r\n\r\nEmployes of the embassies, foreign missions and the U.N. and such carry\r\nspecial cards which exempt them from the payment of all U.S. taxes such\r\nas DC sales, Federal amusement tax, etc. They are, of course, exempt\r\nfrom income tax, too.\r\n\r\nIt’s a racket in Washington to borrow a friend’s card when making any\r\nexpensive purchase like a mink coat, where the sales and luxury tax\r\nswindle comes to 22 per cent by this means.\r\n\r\nA racket begun in UNRRA and now going on in other foreign aid\r\norganizations is engaged in by top administration figures and important\r\ndiplomats:\r\n\r\nMost of the durable goods aid sent abroad goes with the proviso that it\r\nmust be resold in the currency of the country to which it is consigned,\r\nand the money must be used to provide local home relief, such as food,\r\nclothes, etc.\r\n\r\nSo the way it works is this: The embassy wangles a shipment of, shall\r\nwe say, locomotives. They arrive in the country of destination. They\r\nare then duly and dutifully resold in the currency of the country. But\r\nthe law doesn’t say for how much.\r\n\r\nSome locomotives were sold in Greece for 10 drachmas each. The drachma\r\nruns about 1,000 to the dollar. The local poor get the ten drachmas.\r\nThe local political bosses, gangsters and crooked diplomats split the\r\nresale profits with their opposite numbers in America.\r\n\r\nThat’s big racketeering. A couple of Washington sisters have a petty,\r\nbut profitable one. They operate a so-called Embassy social list and\r\ncharge chumps to get on it, dangling invites to diplomatic balls as the\r\nbait, which they obtain from legation employes for a “cut.”\r\n\r\nSome fall for it. Our confidential advice is, don’t pay. You can crash\r\nalmost any Embassy party--but who wants to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23. THE RIGHT TO PETITION\r\n\r\n  “_Congress shall make no law abridging the right of the people\r\n  peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a\r\n  redress of grievances_”--First Amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\n                       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDon’t you believe it. Congress hamstrung lobbying by requiring\r\npractitioners to register. Then it appointed a committee to investigate\r\nthem. Neither gesture got far. Lobbyists are among the most delightful\r\npeople in Washington. They are the friends of everybody, including the\r\nCongressmen who are “probing” them.\r\n\r\nLobbying is like the Indian rope trick. Everyone talks about it, but no\r\none has ever seen it done. It’s one subject all Congressmen shy from,\r\nregardless of party. That’s because there are lobbyists on both sides.\r\nYou can hardly expect a Congressman to insult a supporter.\r\n\r\nMany ex-Congressmen, who can’t bear the thought of returning\r\nhome after their defeat, remain in Washington as lobbyists. They\r\nenjoy an advantage, because, forever after, all ex-Senators and\r\nex-Representatives have the privileges of the floor and the\r\ncloak-rooms. They can collar the ones they need while the legislators\r\nare in action. Thus, members, who are always aware of the possibility\r\nof being lame ducks themselves, keep these pleasant prospects of\r\nearning a generous living after retirement open and in good working\r\norder.\r\n\r\nWhen you read about lobbying being a $100,000,000 business, don’t\r\nbelieve that, either. Maybe they soak their clients that much, but most\r\nof it goes on padded expense accounts. Lobbyists are their own best\r\npress-agents. They are more responsible for the hue and cry against\r\nlobbying than are the reformers. By making it look more difficult, they\r\ncan load their take.\r\n\r\nLobbying is as old as Magna Charta, which first granted people the\r\nright to petition their sovereign. Ever since, those who wanted\r\nsomething have hired someone to speak up for them. Washington is full\r\nof these hucksters. They are about the brightest spot on the glum\r\nscene. They spend, entertain, throw wild parties with pretty gals as\r\nsouvenirs, tip lavishly and keep the hotel and liquor industries going.\r\nThey are the only cream here in a welter of skimmed milk.\r\n\r\nAn Act of Congress, of doubtful legality, requires lobbyists to\r\nregister and divulge the amount and source of their income. Some do,\r\nmany more don’t. Those who comply are the technical lobbyists--in other\r\nwords, they are errand boys who merely transmit messages and appeals\r\nfrom their clients to the Congress. Many have no physical contact with\r\nCongressmen at all, reaching them through mimeographed propaganda\r\nmailed from a Washington office.\r\n\r\nBut most of those we consider lobbyists are the ones who feel they\r\nare not required to register. When we mention anyone in this chapter,\r\nwe are not inferring that if he is not a registered lobbyist he is\r\nbreaking the law. We group together for purposes of posing a picture,\r\nevery Washington lobbyist, fixer, five-percenter, hot-shot lawyer,\r\nindustrial press agent, and man from Missouri. They are a multitude,\r\nespecially men from Missouri.\r\n\r\nWhen a really big fix is made, it usually is not handled in Washington\r\nat all. The deal is consummated back home, as a quid pro quo for a\r\nlarge campaign donation, after which the county or state chairman sends\r\nword through channels to his men in Washington that the matter should\r\nbe okayed.\r\n\r\nLobbying can be a delightful and well-paid occupation. The mouthpieces\r\nof the industrial petitioners are usually charming gentlemen who\r\nknow how to entertain. Buying an uninstructed Congressman C.O.D. is\r\nobsolete. Giving him a high time will do it, and the lobbyist can\r\npocket the money earmarked for bribing and tell his client he passed on\r\nthe boodle.\r\n\r\nMost solons are lonely uprooted rustics. Usually their wives are away,\r\nholy frights they are glad to leave back home. These men want to talk\r\nand drink with someone. You don’t even have to get them girls, just\r\ninvite them to a hotel and spend an evening with them. They’ll be so\r\nthankful, they’ll do anything you want.\r\n\r\nThe average big lobbyist doesn’t bother with run-of-the-mill Senators\r\nand Representatives, who are in the bag without much trouble. He sets\r\nhis sights on the key characters like committee chairmen and floor\r\nleaders, and even they can be snared at little cost, though naturally\r\nto corral a chairman means an even heftier bill to the employer. The\r\nprocedure used in the case of VIPs is simple and cheap. Each lobbyist\r\nis on friendly terms with some local hostess, for whom he does favors\r\nor to whom he gives gifts. When he has an especially important deal\r\non, he asks her to invite his prospect to a party. During most of\r\nthe evening he keeps away from the man he wants to meet, until by a\r\nfortuitous accident he is placed next to him at the table. Even then\r\nthe conversation is kept chatty and frothy. A couple of days later,\r\nthe lobbyist phones his erstwhile table companion and invites him to a\r\nrubber of bridge or a game of golf, and from then on he’s on his own.\r\n\r\nAdministrative heads and assistants are much more sought after than\r\nSenators. They are the ones who receive the deep freezes and their\r\nwives, the expensive gifts. In the final analysis, the best contact\r\nis a clerk, not a division head. The clerks do the work and make the\r\ndecisions while their bosses drink cocktails.\r\n\r\nMuch of the big-time fixing is done by law firms. Many New York outfits\r\nmaintain offices in Washington. These firms usually have partners\r\nbelonging to both parties, so they are prepared for any political\r\neventuality.\r\n\r\nWe would like to introduce you to some of the boys in Washington who\r\ncan get things done:\r\n\r\nFirst comes to mind an attorney, Charles Patrick Clark. Mr. Clark is a\r\nwonder-worker. When others can’t score, Clark is called in. Even Max\r\nTruitt, the Vice President’s son-in-law, had trouble getting Franco’s\r\nloan, so Clark hit in the pinch and Congress voted it. It may be a\r\ncoincidence, but Clark was a counsel for the Senatorial Committee\r\nInvestigating War Frauds when Harry Truman was its chairman.\r\n\r\nPart of Clark’s success can be ascribed to the majestic manner in which\r\nhe entertains. He used to project his parties in Georgetown, but now\r\nhosts it in a palatial four-story building near the Mayflower Hotel.\r\nIt set him back a hundred grand to furnish its interior. The yard was\r\nlandscaped at a cost of $25,000 more. Clark can muster more pretty\r\ngirls than anyone else in Washington. You will always find enough of\r\nthem at his parties. He has two stunners in his office, a blonde and a\r\nbrunette, who frequently are escorted by his clients and his contacts.\r\n\r\nCongressman Buchanan, Pennsylvania Democrat, chairman of the committee\r\ninvestigating lobbying, fell for Clark’s charm. He and his wife visited\r\nClark’s play-place.\r\n\r\nClark is hot-tempered. He recently had a fist fight in the lobby of the\r\nMayflower Hotel with Charlie Rogers, handsome former counsel of the\r\ncommittee that nailed John Maragon.\r\n\r\nDan Hanlon, a former law-partner of Democratic National Chairman Bill\r\nBoyle, has an office at 1727 Massachusetts Ave., where he handles\r\ninternal revenue cases with much success. Hanlon is from Missouri. But\r\nas Boyle seems to be on the way out so is Hanlon.\r\n\r\nThe business is intensively departmentalized. Different lawyers\r\nhave ins in different branches of the government. Persuasion on the\r\nDepartment of Justice is handled by Laughlin Currie, a former Truman\r\nappointee, through Tommy “The Cork” Corcoran, a Roosevelt favorite.\r\n\r\nTreasury Department matters go through Joe Nunan, former Commissioner\r\nof Internal Revenue, who does not practice personally before the\r\nTreasury yet, because the law requires ex-employes to wait two years\r\nbefore they may represent clients in bureaus to which they were\r\nattached. But his associates are not so hobbled.\r\n\r\nFormer Senator Burton K. Wheeler is the man to see if you have any\r\ntrouble with the Interstate Commerce Commission. Wheeler can have\r\nanything he wants in Washington. President Truman passed the word\r\nalong. It was Wheeler who advised Truman not to resign from the Senate\r\nat the time of the Pendergast scandal. Harry has been eternally\r\ngrateful ever since.\r\n\r\nThe law firm of Thurman Arnold, Abe Fortas and Paul A. Porter has\r\npractically everything for its field. All three are prominent\r\nex-New Dealers. Porter’s contact is with the Federal Communications\r\nCommission. Arnold, once a trust-buster, now defends trusts. Fortas,\r\nonetime stooge of Harold Ickes, is the boy to see for anything in the\r\nDepartment of the Interior. Among the clients of this firm is the\r\nWestern Union Telegraph Company, for which they are the registered\r\nlobbyists. During their plugging for the telegraph monopoly it was\r\nbrought out under oath that at least one block of 17 percent of its\r\nstock was owned by underworld figures. Since then, Western Union was\r\nindicted twice in New Jersey for engaging illegally in transmission of\r\nracing information, which the Grand Jury investigation indicated was\r\nthe company’s main source of profit.\r\n\r\nThe Arnold firm secured $200,000,000 for the Puerto Rican government.\r\nIt also defended Owen Lattimore against Senator McCarthy’s charges. The\r\nboys netted $600,000 last year. Drew Pearson’s daughter is married to\r\nArnold’s son.\r\n\r\nArnold is the playboy of the firm, congenial and convivial.\r\n\r\nWhen Dean Acheson’s law firm swung the $90,000,000 Polish loan, its\r\nfee from behind the Iron Curtain was $1,000,000, plus an equal sum for\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nLeon Henderson, the social planner who admits he won World War II\r\nsingle-handed, deserves an important place in this chapter. As one of\r\nthe brain-trust of the “progressive” Americans for Democratic Action,\r\nbrother Henderson throws the weight of that organization’s supposed\r\nvoting strength around Washington for the benefit of his private\r\nclients. That is, when he is not too busy making a fool of himself with\r\nsome young blonde on a New York dance floor.\r\n\r\nThe A.D.A. pipeline into the White House is David Garrison Lloyd,\r\nassistant general counsel to the President.\r\n\r\nRobert Nathan, the CIO economist, who comes up with fantastic\r\nsuggestions such as that the cost of labor has nothing to do with the\r\nfinal price of the commodity, helps support himself by “economizing”\r\nfor capitalistic clients trying to borrow dough from the RFC. If they\r\nhire him, they usually get it.\r\n\r\nThose who shed tears for Louis D. Johnson when he was fired as\r\nSecretary of Defense need have no worries about how Louis is going to\r\nmake a living in the future. He is a partner in the firm of Stepto and\r\nJohnson, and he has high connections.\r\n\r\nLouis, who put the stigma on five-percenters, is one of the biggest\r\noperators on government contracts in town. Incidentally, there’s\r\nnothing illegal about five-percenting and the fee is now seven and a\r\nhalf percent--Truman inflation.\r\n\r\nThough out of the administration, Johnson is so potent and powerful\r\nthat failure to retain him is a death warrant on some deals. He\r\nspecializes in alien property work.\r\n\r\nOnce again, as during World War II, the lobbyists and five-percenters’\r\npassword is “Are You Protected?”\r\n\r\nThat goes for a lot of things. It means are you protected against the\r\nlaw, against competition? But, mainly, are you protected from your\r\nclients?\r\n\r\nToo many fixers found themselves double-crossed. After they had\r\ndelivered, they couldn’t collect.\r\n\r\nNow the smart ones won’t unbutton a button until the cash is put up\r\nin escrow. Fancy deals are worked out on paper to cover up the shady\r\nnature of the real transaction.\r\n\r\nOne contact man whom it was a pleasure to have lobby you was Howard\r\nHughes’ fat errand boy, Johnny Meyer. Johnny is a prodigal entertainer\r\nand check-picker-upper. During the Senatorial investigation into how\r\ncome Hughes got some government contracts, it was testified that Johnny\r\nsupplied gifts and gals lavishly. He introduced Brigadier General\r\nElliott Roosevelt to his former wife, Faye Emerson, and picked up the\r\ntab for the wedding expenses.\r\n\r\nElliott screamed at the hearing, “You are persecuting me because\r\nmy name happens to be Roosevelt.” The Republicans who conducted it\r\nimmediately got cold feet.\r\n\r\nTheir temerity in hounding Elliott and Johnny was not forgotten. Three\r\nyears later, the radical lame duck Senator, Claude Pepper, conducted an\r\ninvestigation to try to prove that former committee chairman Brewster\r\nhad tapped Johnny Meyer’s wires.\r\n\r\nIf he did, he must have had a good time. We know. We were with\r\nJohnny in his Statler suite, and he was with us in ours. His “in” is\r\nformer Washington Governor Mon Wallgren, who is an old drinking and\r\npoker-playing crony of the President. Wallgren has entree at all times\r\nto the White House and now holds a Government hand-out job so he can\r\nkeep his lines and connections in order.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of lame ducks, we mustn’t forget Scott Lucas,\r\nformer Senate Majority leader. He is now ready, willing and able to\r\nhandle such Washington legal and contact matters as may be brought to\r\nthe attention of himself and partner, Charles A. Thomas.\r\n\r\nMany of the lawyers, lobbyists, fixers, five-percenters, etc., with\r\nwires into high places, do not actually practice in Washington,\r\npreferring to do their work through correspondents or connections.\r\n\r\nOne of these is Jake Arvey, the Illinois Democratic boss and associate\r\nof Mafia hoodlums, who operates through the Washington office of Louis\r\nJohnson. Arvey is the kingpin of the wire-pullers.\r\n\r\nOften the extent of a fixer’s ability is overrated. An intermediary\r\nneeds only to be seen with a big politician to have the word get out\r\nthat he’s “in.” Then, after spending thousands, a client sometimes\r\ngets the idea he’s got to hire another lawyer to do the actual work.\r\nSometimes the fixers themselves turn the actual leg work over to\r\ncapable attorneys, sit back, and take the credit.\r\n\r\nThere are many of these bread-and-butter lawyers who accomplish\r\nwhat all the politicians and five-percenters can’t, because they\r\nreally know the law. For instance, one prominent politico told us\r\nthat while few tax cases are “fixed” at the Washington level, many a\r\nfearful and repentant chiseler has been fleeced by smart operators\r\nwho told him they were wonder-workers. For results, he recommended\r\ntwo relatively unknown but very successful practitioners, Bert B.\r\nRand, Washington-wise attorney, and Nathan Wechsler, hard-hitting,\r\nastute C.P.A., because they had the staff and experience to meet the\r\ngovernment on an equal basis.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the field of constitutional law and the intricacies of\r\ncorporation procedure, and claim work, they look up Loring Black, a\r\nformer Congressman from Brooklyn, who retired from the House in 1934.\r\n\r\nOne young fellow who can do more for you in Washington with less\r\nfanfare doesn’t make it his business. He is Hal Korda, onetime\r\nnewspaperman, who has many powerful friends on both sides. When the\r\nDems found out he knew Republicans, and vice versa, they began to\r\nuse him as a channel to square things they didn’t want to talk about\r\ndirectly to each other, and he secured campaign contributions for both.\r\n\r\nMany members of Congress lobby, legitimately, for their own\r\ncommunities, or the industries thereof, or for public organizations in\r\nwhich they have a deep interest.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Joseph Rider Farrington, the delegate from the Territory\r\nof Hawaii, who holds a seat in the House but no vote there, has been\r\nforemost in the fight to secure statehood for the Islands. Farrington\r\nhas labored mightily in that cause, and could show the professionals a\r\nthing or two. If Hawaii ever achieves statehood, Farrington can take\r\nthe bow.\r\n\r\nIncidental to that great libertarian campaign, Farrington also plugs\r\nthe produce and products of the Territory and is its chief booster for\r\ntourism. His office in the Old House Building resembles a cross between\r\na steamship agency and a Chamber of Commerce.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Henry Latham, one of the three Republicans in the\r\nHouse from the City of New York--if you count Javits a Republican--is\r\na strong and sincere booster for the Navy. Were it not for his\r\n“lobbying” in committee, we would have no Marine Corps today.\r\n\r\nLatham, a Navy officer in World War II, did not know he had been run\r\nfor Congress or elected until his ship went into a South Pacific\r\ncoaling station two months after the 1944 elections. He has been\r\nreelected ever since.\r\n\r\nHe spotted the joker which would have wiped out the Marine Corps in\r\nthe administration Defense reorganization measure and tied the bill up\r\nuntil the Devil Dogs were assured of being more than a mere “police\r\nforce.”\r\n\r\nAcey Caraway, finance director of the Democratic National Committee and\r\nlongtime pillar of that body, is opening an office for “consultation”\r\nin the LaSalle Building. Acey, often referred to as the “junior Jim\r\nFarley,” probably knows more Democratic rank-and-filers than anyone\r\nelse in the party.\r\n\r\nAmong the law firms which have had the most success in lucrative\r\nimmigration matters is the New York one in which Rep. Franklin D.\r\nRoosevelt, Jr., is a partner.\r\n\r\nThomas Shoemaker, a former Commissioner of Immigration, also shows\r\nremarkable results in such cases.\r\n\r\nNew York’s left-wing New Deal Republican Congressman Jacob K. Javits\r\nis a partner in Javits and Javits, 1025 Connecticut Avenue. Several\r\nimmigration matters have been settled successfully by them.\r\n\r\nWholly apart from such legal practices, the current price for\r\nbringing in a rich refugee who can’t make the quota or other entry\r\nrequirements is $75,000. This is split between three Senators and/or\r\nRepresentatives, to sponsor so-called “private” bills.\r\n\r\nThese bills are always passed, because the three interested members\r\nbuttonhole other Congressmen, who themselves need support to pass their\r\nown private bills. That is called “Congressional courtesy.”\r\n\r\nAn embarrassing incident happened recently when President Truman vetoed\r\none such bill, after the 75 Gs had been passed and spent.\r\n\r\nThe Vice President’s son-in-law, Max Truitt, lobbies for American\r\nflag steamship lines, and has had conspicuous success in obtaining\r\ngovernment handouts. He is effective also for the Kansas City wheat\r\npit, a favorite whipping boy of the administration he’s married into.\r\n\r\nLobbying before the Maritime Administration is dream business. It had\r\n17 billion dollars’ worth of ships to sell after the war.\r\n\r\nMuch of this government property found its way into the hands of the\r\nright people, who floated their purchases, if not their ships, by\r\nborrowing from the government, then immediately reselling at double or\r\ntriple to corporations they organized.\r\n\r\nIn addition, these purchasers charged off hundreds of thousands against\r\ntheir income taxes for expenses, on transactions which they frequently\r\nwent into with no more than a few thousand dollars to start with.\r\n\r\nTruitt is the most active in the ship field and is registered as a ship\r\nlobbyist with Congress.\r\n\r\nThe firm of the late Secretary of State Stettinius also dabbled in\r\nMaritime Administration work. His associate was handsome ex-Congressman\r\nJoe Casey, of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nOne of the most up-and-coming of the lawyers with “inside” connections\r\nis Margaret Truman’s “date,” Marvin Braverman. It is doubtful whether\r\nhe has much influence, but people are beginning to credit him with it,\r\nand he is no chump. He is taking advantage of the publicity.\r\n\r\nBraverman is related to Harry Hershfield, the radio wit and cartoonist.\r\nAnd if his small talk is anything like Harry’s, we don’t blame Margaret\r\nfor liking him. Because Harry is the funniest man alive.\r\n\r\nFormer Housing Administrator Wilson Wyatt, a roaring Fair Dealer, is\r\nlobbying for big interests to repeal war-time taxes as well as for the\r\nDominican Republic dictatorship.\r\n\r\nClark Clifford, the President’s former legal adviser and ghost-writer,\r\nis not starving in private practice, either.\r\n\r\nClifford says he “doesn’t need law books.” He uses the Mayflower Hotel\r\nmenu instead.\r\n\r\nAnother law firm with great influence is Fulton, Walter and Halley,\r\nwith offices over the Occidental Restaurant. Hugh Fulton was chief\r\ncounsel for the Truman Committee. Rudolph Halley was on the staff. The\r\nfirm has done handily representing Howard Hughes, owner of TWA. As\r\nspecial counsel for the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, between New York\r\nCity and suburban New Jersey, they secured a 50-percent fare increase\r\nfrom the ICC. In our book _Chicago Confidential_, we said that the\r\nunderworld had large blocks of stock in the Hudson and Manhattan. Since\r\nthen Halley, who was the counsel of the road, confirmed our statement,\r\nreluctantly, and we have affidavits to prove it.\r\n\r\nA law degree is not always necessary to a successful contact man.\r\nSome of the most prosperous in Washington bill themselves as press\r\nagents. There is, for instance, a little man from Missouri, Victor\r\nMessall, who dresses like a race-track follower and has his walls\r\nplastered with pictures of the President. Messall was a beaver on the\r\nPresident’s Senatorial campaigns. Later he was on his secretarial staff\r\nin the Senate. He has testified under oath that he has so many clients\r\nhe can’t remember them all. A witness charged before the Kefauver\r\nCommittee he had given Messall $1500 to help him to get sugar-points\r\nillegally from the OPA during the war. The chairman of the committee\r\nwas a Democrat. The counsel was the aforementioned lawyer for the\r\nTruman committee, Rudolph Halley. The subject was suddenly dropped.\r\n\r\nAnother who bills himself as a press agent and is blossoming into a\r\npower which some call sinister because of his connections, is a former\r\nnewspaperman, Dave Charnay, who runs a publicity firm in New York and\r\nWashington, Allied Syndicate. Charnay is a long-time friend of Frank\r\nCostello, reputed king of the underworld, and has done public relations\r\nfor Rep. F. D. Roosevelt, Jr., and Manhattan Borough President Robert\r\nF. Wagner, Jr., son of the author of the Labor Act.\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of Mayor LaGuardia, when gangsters were\r\nordered out of New York night clubs, Charnay, then still employed as a\r\nreporter for the New York _News_, was made “president” of the famous\r\nCopacabana at a salary of $500 a week. Charnay was known as Costello’s\r\npress agent.\r\n\r\nAmong other clients, his publicity firm represents John L. Lewis’\r\nUnited Mine Workers, at a reputed annual fee of $175,000. Those who\r\nmay seem mystified at his range of clients, may be surprised to learn\r\nthat Lewis, though he doesn’t know it, is a prisoner of the Mafia. It\r\nstarted many years ago, when the United Mine Workers imported Sicilian\r\nsluggers from the big cities. With this “in,” the mob bosses began to\r\ncast greedy eyes on the colossal fortune owned by the mine union. The\r\nMafia’s policy is never to replace present management if it can take\r\nover a flourishing concern. The infiltration went on under Lewis’ nose,\r\nyet the beetle-browed egomaniac does not know he no longer is the boss\r\nof the United Mine Workers. The boys let him think he is. Last year,\r\nthe Mine Workers tried to take over New York’s taxi industry, with an\r\nabortive strike in which Mafia associates took a part. Charnay’s firm\r\nhandled the strikers’ publicity.\r\n\r\nCharnay now has a pipeline directly to the White House, through the\r\nclose personal friendship between John L. Lewis and Dr. John Steelman,\r\nassistant to the President. Some months ago, on his retirement as\r\nSecretary of the Navy, John L. Sullivan joined Charnay’s firm as\r\nchairman of the board, but he resigned to practice law. Paul H.\r\nGriffith, assistant Secretary of Defense until he was replaced by Anna\r\nRosenberg a few months ago, is now a vice-president of the company.\r\n\r\nCharnay had a pleasant luncheon tête-à-tête with Kefauver counsel\r\nHalley, before the crime committee began its hearings, and offered to\r\nwork for it without pay.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting lobbyist is Samuel Haines, whose contract with the\r\nhotel and cafe industry to try to get a reduction in the 20 percent\r\namusement-tax was on a sliding scale, his fee to be determined by\r\nthe degree of eventual tax reduction. The tax wasn’t cut, but he got\r\n$46,000. Haines entertained Senators and Representatives in a playroom\r\nat his home, where he had slot-machines, reverse-rigged so the players\r\nalways won.\r\n\r\nA mysterious man about town is Dave Gordon, always seen with beautiful\r\ndames. Gordon is a close friend of Nate Lichtauer. Lichtauer is a\r\nshadowy enigma. Little is known about him. But this is to tell you\r\nhe engineers the juiciest deals. (“Juice” is the capital slang for\r\npolitical pull.) Lichtauer is a collector for the Democratic National\r\nCommittee. He makes the arrangements. When the contributions come\r\nthrough, he passes the word to Dave Niles, in the White House, who\r\npulls the proper strings.\r\n\r\nOne of Lichtauer’s closest associates is Milton Kronheim, another\r\nmystery man. He used to be in the bail-bond business in Washington and\r\nwent surety for gamblers. He is now the city’s biggest and richest\r\nwholesale liquor dealer. He is in on everything. He once peeled off 250\r\nbills--$1,000 bills--to pay an OPA assessment, then put the balance of\r\nthe still impressive roll back in his pocket.\r\n\r\nHe is close to General Vaughan and John Maragon, and thick with\r\nJake Arvey, Chicago Democratic boss, friend and apologist for Al\r\nCapone’s cousin, Charlie Fischetti, king of the Chicago underworld.\r\nKronheim’s son was recently made a Municipal Court judge in Washington.\r\nTruman nominated Kronheim’s lawyer, “Jiggs” Donahue to be District\r\nCommissioner. And Kronheim supplies the White House liquor.\r\n\r\nOne to watch as a power is a Boston lawyer, Paul T. Smith. He got\r\nthat way because he and Dave Niles ran a forum in Boston called\r\nFord’s Lyceum, a sort of left-wing Chatauqua in which Frankfurter had\r\na powerful say. When Police Chief Barrett was under Congressional\r\npressure, Niles and Smith interceded.\r\n\r\nIt was through the connections he made with dreamers and schemers like\r\nHarry Hopkins, who used to lecture for him, that Niles moved himself\r\ninto the White House under Roosevelt and has remained under Truman,\r\nthe only man Harry dared not fire. Niles, whose hand turns up in\r\neverything, may be the real ruler of the country.\r\n\r\nAnyway, when attorney Smith gets a case with a Washington angle, he\r\nphones the White House. He usually gets what he wants.\r\n\r\nNiles still operates Ford’s, spends every weekend, from Thursday to\r\nMonday, in Boston. Niles’ hatchet man is Donald Dawson, of Missouri,\r\nformerly with the RFC, now White House Liaison Officer in charge\r\nof personnel. He is the last word on all federal nominations and\r\nappointments, but his word is Niles’.\r\n\r\nA couple of weeks before this went to press we saw Dawson lunching at\r\nthe Statler with General Vaughan and Johnny Maragon.\r\n\r\nIf the impression was conveyed that after Maragon’s conviction and\r\ndenial on appeal that the pet five-percenter was out of action, you\r\nwere so wrong. Up to this writing, Maragon has never served a day\r\nin jail, and he probably never will. News about Maragon is a scarce\r\ncommodity in Washington, and bum steers are handed newspapermen. It was\r\npublicly reported that Maragon was ill and in the hospital of a Federal\r\nprison. The White House intimate had not spent one minute in jail.\r\nMaragon, the crooked fixer, is still in business and still has entree\r\nto the White House. The wise guys know that if he is ever punished, it\r\nwill be perfunctory, because Maragon took the rap for a lot of way-ups\r\nand what he could tell would rock America. He is still being taken care\r\nof so he will never need to shine shoes again. If he isn’t pardoned by\r\nthe time this comes out, it’s in the works.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, socialites and even foreign noblemen who need the\r\njack lobby for it. A successful contact man is Baron Constantine von\r\nStackelburg, once with the World Bank. He and his beautiful wife host\r\nlavish at-homes for the benefit of such interests as the Florida citrus\r\nfruit industry.\r\n\r\nClients of lobbyists are divided into four groups. You may disregard\r\nthe inspired baloney that they all represent the capitalists. Only a\r\nsmall fraction do.\r\n\r\nThe others who employ lobbyists are (1) Labor unions, farm federations\r\nand left-wing pressure groups; (2) nonprofit and nonpolitical\r\norganizations such as the Red Cross, American Legion, Elks, Knights of\r\nColumbus, etc., and (3) government bureaus.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful lobby in history was for the Anti-Saloon League.\r\n\r\nBy far the mightiest since then, at least until Senator Taft’s\r\noverwhelming victory, were lobbies of the labor unions. By tradition\r\nand shaded reporting the representatives of the money barons are\r\nvillains; but the labor boys are more vicious and intolerable. And they\r\ndon’t spend or entertain, which is even more heinous. The money charged\r\nagainst the unions for legislative purposes goes mostly to supply dames\r\nand hootch for visiting union chiefs.\r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Labor crowd hangs out at the Hamilton Hotel,\r\nwhere all the choice ringside tables in the supper club are reserved\r\nnightly for them. A stable of fillies is available to send up to the\r\nrooms of the dignitaries who dilute their champagne with the tears they\r\nspill for the sans-culottes.\r\n\r\nThe United Mine Workers frequent the Carlton.\r\n\r\nThe CIO also played at the Carlton until a Negro delegate was barred.\r\nMost of the boys quit in a huff, and moved across 16th St. to the\r\nequally tony Hay-Adams, where Negroes are also barred.\r\n\r\nMany labor unions are represented by female lobbyists, and some of\r\nthese will turn a trick in the hay if that helps the sacred cause. The\r\nlabor broads still don’t run as homely as some of the Congressmen’s\r\nwives. For unions and other such pressure cookers do not usually offer\r\nmoney, call-girls or liquor. They threaten to withhold votes back at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a freshman Congressman checks in, the union harpies make\r\na grab for him. One whom we know, a Republican elected to fill an\r\nunexpired seat in a Democratic district, received a visit from a\r\ncouple of union goons the first day he moved into his office. They gave\r\nhim orders how to vote on a pending measure. Congressman John Saylor,\r\nwho is six feet four, grabbed them by the necks and walked them to the\r\nwall, where he showed them his certificate of election.\r\n\r\n“I thought I read my name here, not yours,” he said. Then he threw them\r\nout.\r\n\r\nOne of the most indefatigable female lobbyists is the daughter of\r\nformer Senator Burt Wheeler. Though her father cleans up representing\r\nrobber barons, her client is the left-wing United Electrical Workers\r\nUnion. Congressmen report she’s a pest who coaxes with a smile, and if\r\nthat doesn’t work, she threatens.\r\n\r\nOld-timers in Congress will tell you about the dame lobbyist who\r\nrepresented some milk producers. She was a handsome woman, so\r\nvoluptuously built that they referred to her as “Elsie the Cow.” Her\r\nlobbying career ended in 1937, when she was caught in a hotel room with\r\na Congressman.\r\n\r\nFor all practical purposes, lobbyists representing unions and minority\r\ngroups do not often buttonhole Congressmen directly. Dave Niles handles\r\nall labor and left-wing angles, and arranges for the votes and rewards\r\nor punishments.\r\n\r\nAnna Rosenberg, friend of Niles, former New Dealer, practiced\r\nindustrial relations successfully until her appointment as Assistant\r\nSecretary of Defense.\r\n\r\nLobbyists for government bureaus often double as unpaid fixers for\r\npressure groups, using government funds. Entertainments of Congressmen\r\nby State Department officials at cocktail parties are referred to as\r\n“smokers.”\r\n\r\nSometimes pressure group lobbyists receive government favors and\r\nprivileges denied the less favored. An intensive lobby was conducted\r\nagainst the Mundt-Ferguson anti-Communist bill by a former senatorial\r\nemploye who was not registered as a lobbyist.\r\n\r\nHe is Palmer Webber, who was staff director in 1943 for Sen. Pepper (D)\r\nof Florida, and chief economic adviser in 1944 to Sen. Kilgore (D) of\r\nWest Virginia. Webber bore down on his Senate contacts from a rent-free\r\noffice in the Library of Congress. How he got it free nobody knows.\r\n\r\nFor two years Webber held a job as “legislative correspondent” on\r\nCapitol Hill for the Federation for World Government. Records in the\r\noffice of the secretary of the Senate show Webber was not registered as\r\na lobbyist for the federation and the organization is not registered\r\nto conduct a lobby. In addition to his arduous efforts to defeat the\r\nanti-Communist measure and his work for the federation, Webber was a\r\ndemon, worked for votes for passage of the fair employment practices\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nWebber was transferred by the World Government Federation from\r\nWashington to New York “to do research.” The shift was for “political\r\nreasons.”\r\n\r\nHe is an errand boy for the Lawyers Guild, which the House Un-American\r\nActivities Committee cited as a “front” organization. It has also\r\nbeen active in another “cause” sponsored by Webber--the drive for an\r\ninvestigation of the F.B.I.\r\n\r\nIn 1947, Webber, a Ph.D., conducted a class in political philosophy\r\nat the King Smith school, where the democratic form of government was\r\nsmeared to GI and other students.\r\n\r\nA reporter attended Webber’s class on May 27, 1947, when Senator\r\nPepper was a guest. A woman student referred to J. Edgar Hoover as the\r\nAmerican Gestapo head and declared the Catholic church was leading a\r\ncrusade for war.\r\n\r\nA woman in the audience, a secretary to a Republican Senator from the\r\nMidwest, jumped up and shouted, “Thank God for the F.B.I.”\r\n\r\nWebber was arrested in Charlottesville, Va., for distributing Communist\r\nParty literature. Police records show he paid a forfeit rather than\r\nfight the case.\r\n\r\nHe was at one time a research director for the CIO Political Action\r\nCommittee in Washington and in 1948 was a paid director in charge of\r\nactivities of the leftist Progressive party in 11 southern states.\r\n\r\nAnother who lobbies against anti-Communist bills, and is openly so\r\nregistered, is former Democratic Congressman Jerry J. O’Connell, of\r\nMontana.\r\n\r\nUtilizing his privileges of the floor, as an ex-Representative,\r\nO’Connell strides into the House and Senate while they are in session,\r\nand delivers advice, orders and inspiration to left-wing Congressmen,\r\nand threats to others.\r\n\r\nWhen the Senate was debating the Communist control bill in an all night\r\nsession last September, O’Connell took up a station at the Senate door\r\nwith a reporter from the Daily Worker, and without any pretense of\r\ndisguise, dictated the unsuccessful opposition’s floor strategy.\r\n\r\nBut listen to the hue and cry when a manufacturer’s lobbyist buys a\r\nCoca Cola for a Congressman.\r\n\r\nBeing a government lobbyist can produce desirable advantages,\r\nespecially for a Marshall Plan press agent.\r\n\r\nA survey reveals that the Economic Cooperation Administration\r\ninformation office has been giving several of its employes free\r\nvisits to Europe and the Middle East. Robert Mullen, director of ECA\r\ninformation, toured Europe. He mapped a $7,500 ’round-the-world trip,\r\nbut postponed a visit to the Orient when the bullets began to fly.\r\n\r\nMullen sent an heiress to the J. P. Morgan banking fortune to London\r\nfor a convention of clubwomen--to get new propaganda material on the\r\nMarshall plan to influence American clubwomen. He sent an inexperienced\r\nyouth, hired as a “picture expert,” to Paris and London, to see the\r\nsights and get new pictures for propaganda purposes here.\r\n\r\nThough ECA has 73 American press employes in Paris alone, and 56 in\r\n16 other Marshall Plan missions in Europe, plus 222 Europeans on\r\nthese staffs, ECA sent a former woman reporter to Paris to get “human\r\ninterest” stories for a clubwoman propaganda pamphlet.\r\n\r\nThe ECA press information office in Paris has a chief who gets about\r\n$20,000 a year in salary and expense money, has highly paid former\r\nreporters on his staff, but the ECA here sent a man from Washington to\r\nshow a group of editors about Europe. Several others went to Europe on\r\nsimilar assignments.\r\n\r\nMullen has 48 on his Washington staff, drawing a total of $280,000\r\na year. Among these are the Morgan heiress, an ex-bullfighter, the\r\ndaughter of a symphony conductor and a score of graduates from defunct\r\nwar agencies. He separated a noted Negro Air Force pilot, who achieved\r\nsome success as an author, from his Washington staff and dispatched him\r\nto Formosa at $15,000 a year to direct Marshall plan press information\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe American press agents for ECA will draw $673,000 in salaries this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nCongress gets around sporadically to investigating the lobbying “evil.”\r\nThe latest “crusade” was conducted by leftish Congressman Frank\r\nBuchanan, who muddled the issue so much, no one knows what happened,\r\nexcept that the National Association of Manufacturers emerged the\r\nvillain. Congressmen don’t hanker to expose lobbies, even if they’re on\r\nthe other side. When the investigation was first voted by the House,\r\nBuchanan wanted to give the appropriation back, an unprecedented\r\ndeparture where committee chairmen always yell for more. Buchanan tried\r\nto handcuff the lawyers engaged to conduct the investigation, though\r\nboth were good Democrats and good Fair Dealers. But they were also\r\nhonest. Lou Little, of Pittsburgh, a co-counsel, quit broken-hearted.\r\nCounsel Benedict Fitzgerald, of Greenfield, Mass., a whiz of a prober,\r\nwas not even allowed to write the report. Buchanan refused to swear\r\nin some witnesses; if they lied it would not constitute perjury. When\r\ncounsel called attention to that, he angrily shut them up.\r\n\r\nThe real brains of the investigation into lobbying was Lucien Hilmer,\r\ncommittee staff director. He is regarded as a left-wing lawyer. When\r\nGeorge Shaw Wheeler was fired from the government for consorting with\r\nCommunists, Hilmer appeared as his lawyer and beat the case. Two years\r\nlater, as an economist with the U. S. Army in Czechoslovakia, Wheeler\r\nvindicated the Civil Service Commission when he moved in on Berlin Red\r\nheadquarters. He announced he was a Communist and always had been one.\r\nHilmer shares a law office with John F. Davis, who represented Alger\r\nHiss before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Hilmer had\r\nworked under Max Lowenthal on the old Wheeler Committee.\r\n\r\nAnd did we remember to tell you that the Kansas City Chamber of\r\nCommerce has an office on 16th St., across the road from the Russian\r\nEmbassy? Both pressure groups have displayed amazing influence in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n_INSIDE STUFF_: The law requiring lobbyists to register is used as a\r\nracket by some. They advertise in trade papers: “Lobbyist, registered\r\nwith the Congress of the United States,” then sell prospective chumps\r\nthe idea they are “licensed” to lobby. Anybody may file his name and\r\nset up his own “cause.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24. RACKETS BY REMOTE CONTROL\r\n\r\n\r\nOur newspaper confreres, in the main, were willing to be hospitable and\r\nhelpful when we galloped in and made no secret of our aims. We don’t\r\nexpect them to write our books. But they often give us tips, which\r\nsaves work.\r\n\r\nThe first question we asked was, “Who is the Washington Mafia boss?”\r\n\r\nThe invariable answer was that the local underworld was unaffiliated\r\nwith the national setup, free and independent, self-contained.\r\n\r\nAll our experience made us reject that picture. We had traced and\r\ncharted organized crime through the gang wars of Prohibition to this\r\nday. We had charged and it was being substantiated that no city of\r\nimportance was left out of the clutches of the Mafia, with its brains\r\nin New York and its powerhouse in Chicago. It was inconceivable that\r\na rich, large center on the Atlantic seaboard, almost a suburb of\r\nManhattan, could be bypassed. So we found out for ourselves. This is\r\nthe situation in Washington:\r\n\r\nThe National Syndicate, for reasons of prudence, has avoided first-hand\r\noperations in the District. You find few important Sicilian names in\r\nthe police files. Vice, crime, gambling, narcotics and, to a smaller\r\nextent, contraband liquor, are farmed out by franchise to a cohesive\r\nlocal mob which deals with and pays tribute to national headquarters.\r\n\r\nDespite tremendous influence, legal advice and guidance and the\r\nconstitutional immunity against self-incrimination, the Mafia has\r\nan almost superstitious fear of Congressional committees. A city\r\nadministration can be bought or scared or rigged. But nobody can\r\ncapture 96 Senators and 435 Representatives. And any one of these is\r\none of the immediate bosses of Washington; and any one of these can\r\narise any day and demand a probe of anything. On the rare occasions\r\nwhen important racketeers were dragged to Washington on subpena, with\r\nall the assurances they got from many members beholden to them and\r\nthe shocking obeisance paid them openly, they wet their pants in the\r\nwitness chair.\r\n\r\nYet, these greedy gluttons can’t find it in their miserly souls to\r\ndeclare it an open town, any more than they can force themselves to\r\npay honest income taxes, though they awaken in their silk pajamas\r\nscreaming, from nightmare dreams about Al Capone and Alcatraz.\r\n\r\nDistrict of Columbia is and was dominated by Emmitt Warring, Gary\r\nQuinn, Sam Beard, the Sussman brothers and Attilio Acalotti. The chief\r\noperation of these men is gambling, which will be traced in more detail\r\nlater. They staked out locations in Washington, worked together in\r\nharmony, well aware that the capital would not go for Chicago-style\r\nassassinations.\r\n\r\nBut the national Syndicate did not hesitate to work openly in the\r\nadjoining Maryland suburbs, where the late Jimmy La Fontaine, who died\r\nin bed at the age of 81 in 1949, was the local front man. Fontaine’s\r\nrococo gambling casino, across the street from the District line, was\r\nas far as the Mafia cared to go openly. His chief lieutenants were\r\nSnags Lewis, Pete Gianaris and Mike Meyers. Snags has pleaded guilty to\r\na mild rap on a bargain which will take the heat off others.\r\n\r\nWe have described the dope setup in the District, where local\r\nwholesalers send to New York for supplies, so that the Mafia does\r\nnot have to deliver them in the capital. By a similar procedure,\r\nthe gamblers and other racketeers procure their wire service from\r\nrepresentatives of the big mob, across the border in Maryland. Snags\r\nLewis was the local wire service man.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to such things as numbers, whoring, illicit liquor and\r\nafter-hour spots in the District, the local boys tried to hold on to as\r\nmuch as they could. They didn’t want to divvy up with the Syndicate.\r\nThe big mob didn’t like that.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mafia moves in, it gears its method to local situations. For\r\ninstance, Dallas, one of the last hold-outs, is being taken over at\r\nthis writing by strong-arm work and gunplay.\r\n\r\nBut when the beach-front bookmaking syndicate in Miami held out, it\r\nwas cut off from its wire service, then local cops did the gangsters’\r\nwork by raiding the recalcitrants, to make way for the Syndicate’s own\r\noperators.\r\n\r\nIt was clear to Frank Costello in New York and Charlie Fischetti in\r\nChicago, the operating heads of the underworld, that gat-work would not\r\nbe tolerated in Washington. They knew the Metropolitan Police couldn’t\r\nbe counted on to cooperate, with J. Edgar Hoover on the grounds.\r\nFew understand why the F.B.I. has not acted against the Mafia. Its\r\njurisdiction is circumscribed by Congress, and the black-handers have\r\nbeen smart enough to keep out of fields in which Hoover may act.\r\n\r\nThe outside mobsters adopted a third procedure to tighten their hold on\r\nthe local underworld, one that had worked with great success in other\r\ntowns. It came through with flying colors in Washington. Last year\r\nthere was an epidemic of robberies of local underworld figures, and not\r\nby accident or coincidence.\r\n\r\nOne victim was Emmitt Warring. Three men forced their way into his\r\nhome, at 3900 Macomb Street, and robbed it at gun-point. Insiders\r\nsay the amount of cash lifted from Warring’s safe was about $100,000.\r\nWarring told newspapermen it was only $20,000. He refused to cooperate\r\nwith the police and would not admit or deny that the holdup had taken\r\nplace. In the same week, the same thugs held up Johnny Williams, a\r\nnumbers racket boss. Robert “Ryebread” Schulman and Theodore “Little\r\nJoe” Scheve also were held up. Williams’ father-in-law is Dick Austin,\r\na numbers king in Atlantic City and Washington.\r\n\r\nChief of Police Barrett said, “I am alarmed by the crimes. We can’t\r\nhave this sort of thing going on here. Pretty soon somebody’s going to\r\nget shot.” That was Scheve. But nobody got arrested. Then Washington\r\nracketeers saw a great light. They made peace with the Big Mob, which\r\nestablished its regency over the District, leaving the former operators\r\nin as partners with nominal control.\r\n\r\nGeorge P. Harding, victim of the recent slaying in the Hideaway Club,\r\nengineered the Warring robbery for the Mafia. Harding was born in Italy\r\nand had a long and bloody career as a gunman and killer, before being\r\nslain by his friend and associate, Joseph Nesline.\r\n\r\nNesline, who admitted the shooting, is a four-time loser. He told\r\npolice it was either “Harding or me.” His story was Harding had accused\r\nhim of running out with his share of the gravy in a gangster-operated\r\noil well deal in Texas, where Frank Costello and his boys are buying\r\nheavily into leases and royalties. The dead man had been sitting with\r\nGeorge A. Clainos, white-slaver and member of the local Syndicate, who\r\npassed him a gun.\r\n\r\nThe actual cause of the killing, which we are telling you confidential,\r\nis that it was ordered from Mafia headquarters in Brooklyn, because\r\nHarding, who knew too much, was an intemperate drinker and was talking\r\ntoo much.\r\n\r\nHarding had been warned “to be good or else” several months ago,\r\nthrough word transmitted by Tony Ricci, alias Tony Goebels, who is the\r\nmessage-center for the Unione Siciliano.\r\n\r\nThe formula of permitting local operators to retain management was\r\nfollowed last year when the mob moved into Tampa and Jacksonville,\r\nFlorida, and was used also with much success in Newark, New Jersey,\r\nwhere the non-Italian mob of Abner “Longy” Zwillman was absorbed into\r\nthe Mafia. The Cleveland branch, run chiefly by Jews and Irish, was\r\ngiven the same modus operandi and absorbed.\r\n\r\nThe chain of command and remittance from the District to top\r\nheadquarters is through Prince Georges County, Maryland, where Gianaris\r\nhandles the numbers intake from the District and Lewis superintends\r\npayments for horse wire service--which is utilized also as a clearing\r\nhouse to transmit receipts from all other illegal activities, entered\r\non the books as payments for the services or as losses on bets.\r\n\r\nLa Fontaine’s organization is kept together by Lewis and Meyers.\r\nCharlie Ford, Washington lawyer, who appears frequently in this book as\r\ncounsel for gamblers, vice-hucksters and bottle-clubs, is the trustee\r\nof La Fontaine’s fabulous estate. In this connection some complicated\r\nbookkeeping is required.\r\n\r\nIt develops La Fontaine was only a front man. Eighty percent of his\r\nholdings belonged to the Big Mob. His death brought intricate mixups,\r\nand what was his and what was the Mob’s had not been identified in full\r\ndetail. The situation is similar to that which followed the slaying\r\nof Edward J. O’Hare, Chicago mobster, who operated race tracks for\r\nthe Capone syndicate. The stock of Sportsman’s Park, Chicago, and the\r\nMiami Beach Kennel Club was in his name. He left it to his heirs and\r\nassociates. It took years for the accounts to be straightened out, and\r\nwhen they were, some money was paid over in the form of a “loan” to\r\nPaul “The Waiter” Ricca, a close associate of the late Capone, who is\r\none of the ruling heads of the secret Grand Council of the Mafia.\r\n\r\nThe La Fontaine payoff to the top was made through Nig Rosen of\r\nPhiladelphia to Meyer Lansky of New York. Lansky is a tributary of\r\nFrank Costello and a gambling partner of Joe Adonis. Nig Rosen is a\r\nfriend of Washington Police Chief Barrett.\r\n\r\nLa Fontaine was one of the most colorful men Washington ever saw. His\r\nlegendary career as a gentleman gambler spanned half a century. This\r\nlast of the gas-lit era gamblers was one of five children of a poultry\r\ndealer. He was apprenticed to his father’s trade and might have carved\r\nfor himself a similar career, except for a fatal flaw in his make-up:\r\nhe could not bear to kill a chicken, nor could he stand the thought\r\nof others killing chickens he had raised. He hid his favorites in his\r\nfather’s attic.\r\n\r\nA three-cent strike Jimmy made on the old St. Louis lottery netted\r\nhim $12. With this he set up shop across the Potomac in Virginia. He\r\nthen went to work for the Heath brothers, old-time gambling combine. He\r\nsoon had his own card table and he prospered. Subsequently he opened\r\nthe Mohican Club, near Glen Echo, Maryland. Expanding, he purchased a\r\nlarge tract in Prince Georges County and established “Jimmy’s Place.”\r\nAround it he built a high green fence and within it men won and lost\r\nfortunes. Women never got past the door and no man who couldn’t afford\r\nto lose was ever admitted again. It was staffed by more than a hundred\r\ncarefully chosen attendants, all covered by social security. They made\r\nregular contributions to a retirement fund.\r\n\r\nThe house limit was $200 on craps, $500 a card on blackjack, and $10 on\r\nnumbers, with no-limit games in private rooms for certain customers who\r\ncould stand a tough tap. “Jimmy’s” catered to as many as 2,000 gamblers\r\na night.\r\n\r\nOddly, La Fontaine never got out of the poultry business. His passion\r\nwas cock-fighting and he maintained a stable of 100 birds. Seeing\r\nthem killed in action did not affront him. He also made horse book\r\nand traveled from track to track. La Fontaine bankrolled Tex Rickard,\r\nthe fabulous fight promoter, in his early days. After Rickard’s death\r\nhe formed a silent partnership with Herman Taylor, Philadelphia fight\r\npromoter.\r\n\r\nJimmy served a jail term for income tax evasion and paid a fine of more\r\nthan $200,000. The Big Mob had long cast covetous eyes on La Fontaine,\r\nwho by now not only had his own profitable gambling enterprise on which\r\nhe himself admitted paying off $100,000 a year for local protection,\r\nbut he controlled also the entire underworld in the lush Maryland\r\ncounties adjoining the District. About 20 years ago, emissaries from\r\nPhiladelphia came down to muscle him out. One representative of Nig\r\nRosen, a gunman named Milsie Henry, was mysteriously murdered, for\r\nwhich La Fontaine was loudly but not officially mentioned. The case\r\nis still unsolved. Shortly thereafter, La Fontaine was kidnaped by\r\nhoodlums from New York and Philadelphia. Before he was returned his\r\nfamily had to come up with $40,000 “expense money.” And the Mafia was\r\ndeclared in on his enterprises.\r\n\r\nMost naïve Washingtonians believe the appointment of attorney Charlie\r\nFord as the trustee of his estate was a logical sequence, as Ford is\r\na gamblers’ lawyer. He testified before a house committee that he\r\nrepresented many gamblers, some of whom were such powers that they\r\nwere unknown to the police or public as gamblers. He refused to divulge\r\ntheir identities. One is a liquor dealer and another, a local jeweler.\r\n\r\nFord has legal contacts with the topmost figures of the Mafia. When the\r\nwife of Charlie Fischetti, one of the most powerful men in the national\r\nunderworld, the most powerful in Chicago, was subpoenaed before the\r\nKefauver Committee, Ford flew to Chicago to represent her, though the\r\nFischetti-Guzik gang has staffs of legal sharks who specialize in\r\noutwitting the authorities.\r\n\r\nQuite often there is legal jockeying following the death of important\r\ngangsters like La Fontaine.\r\n\r\nAfter Bugsy Siegel was slain in Beverly Hills, Morris Rosen showed up\r\nfrom New York at Siegel’s ornate Flamingo and took over all of the\r\nmurdered man’s assets before his body was cold. They had never belonged\r\nto him at all. They were Syndicate property. So was 80 per cent of La\r\nFontaine’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25. WHO’S WHO IN MOBOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two books and for the hundreds of newspaper stories we have done on\r\nAmerican gangsters and their maze of intertwining organization we got\r\nenough to be publicly proclaimed America’s top experts in the field.\r\n\r\nWe have been offered lectures and speaking engagements before bodies\r\nof bankers, merchants, criminologists, police conventions and on radio\r\nprograms. But we have saved some new names and some newly-discovered\r\nsecrets for this book, because a “confidential” without that factor\r\nwould be regarded as a gold brick; and because our publisher knows us\r\nand trusts us and hasn’t the rabbit in him that the owners of other\r\nmedia display, when they say:\r\n\r\n“But you just can’t publish that kind of stuff. You’ll get us all\r\nkilled!”\r\n\r\nOne magazine which paid for the rights to do a digest of _Chicago\r\nConfidential_ weakened and, instead, did a piece speculating on our\r\nchances of surviving our tenure on the bestseller lists!\r\n\r\nWe have our own ways of getting this material, which so many think is\r\nso dangerous. It comes from many sources, all confidential. Some of it\r\nis right from the racketeers, themselves, for they have vendettas and\r\njealousies and hatreds on which they don’t dare to act in the open. The\r\nwidow of a murdered hoodlum drove hundreds of miles and met us in a car\r\nin Central Park and gave us the tale of who rubbed him out and why.\r\nThis was a woman who had told the cops and the prosecutors that she\r\nknew nothing, had no idea how her husband made a living, had never met\r\nany one who was even “shady.”\r\n\r\nHere and there a person who has been shaken down or shaken out, and\r\nthus knows a small angle which may be valuable as a tip-off on one or\r\ntwo people and authentic tactics gets to us and spills.\r\n\r\nWe don’t believe all we hear. But facts mesh up and patterns form and\r\ntruths evolve.\r\n\r\nWe have sketched for you the process whereby the pennies, dimes and\r\ndollars of the numbers-players, horse-bettors, hookers and junkies\r\nare harvested in Washington and funneled to the satraps who live in\r\npenthouses and mansions in New York, Chicago, Beverly Hills and Rome.\r\nThey are big industry, our biggest. And while the principals hide in\r\ntheir drawing-rooms even if they pass through Washington, to or from\r\nFlorida, they must maintain here high-powered lawyers, tax experts\r\nwho study and report every decision of the Treasury, lobbyists, press\r\nagents and spies. Many of the vast legal businesses into which they\r\nchannel their cash have branch stores and offices here. The Syndicate\r\nis an international conspiracy, as potent as that other international\r\nconspiracy, Communism, and as dirty and dangerous, with its great\r\nwealth and the same policy--to conquer everything and take over\r\neverything, with no scruples as to how.\r\n\r\nThis gigantic money trust has assets of billions, exceeding the\r\ncombined wealth of Morgan, Rockefeller and all the Wall Street\r\nfreebooters of old.\r\n\r\nIt owns, through legitimate sources of trade, incalculable commercial,\r\nresidential, hotel and investment real estate, surpassing the holdings\r\nof insurance companies. Through its purchase of stocks and bonds\r\nit controls some and is attempting to control other transportation\r\ncompanies, as well as railroads, hotel chains, distilleries and\r\nbreweries, department stores and chain stores, clothing and dress\r\nmanufacturers, steel and iron works, franchised automobile\r\ndistributors, trans-Atlantic steamship lines, a movie producer, a\r\nradio chain, a big-league ball team, phonograph recording companies,\r\ninsurance corporations, banks, theatres, night clubs, laundries,\r\noil wells; it has been buying into even newspapers. This is only a\r\ncondensed catalog of its dishonest interests in once-honest enterprises.\r\n\r\nA thief is always a thief. These modern pirates could not go straight.\r\nAs soon as they dip their sticky hands into something legitimate, it\r\ngoes crooked.\r\n\r\nOne of their favorite tactics is to buy in the open market enough stock\r\nof a company, to create a nuisance value. They organize a minority\r\nstockholders’ committee and dig up proxies. They have no real intention\r\nof trying to get control, but some time before the stockholders’\r\nmeeting, they approach the management and offer to sell at a premium,\r\nusually three or four times above the market listing. This is cold\r\nblackmail.\r\n\r\nAnother tactic, employed when they secure control of a transportation\r\ncompany, is to use their political connections to get a fare raise.\r\nThat enhances the stock on the market, then they unload.\r\n\r\nThey buy into some companies to get enough stock to rig the price,\r\na felony. In at least one instance with which we are familiar, the\r\nunderworld put a representative in as an officer of a transportation\r\ncompany. He then sold company stock short on the securities exchanges.\r\nThis is a violation of SEC law. When a complaint was made by other\r\nstockholders to the SEC, the man they talked to shrugged his shoulders\r\nand said, “Forget it. They have a fix.”\r\n\r\nOperators with such tremendous financial interests know their way\r\naround Washington. One of their chief sources of contact is through\r\nDemocratic county, state and national committeemen, who are beholden\r\nfor campaign contributions. Sometimes cash is handed over to sweeten\r\nthe kitty. The committeemen and political bosses pass the orders along\r\nthrough their Congressmen in Washington, or, when the fix is important\r\nenough, directly to a specialist at such affairs right in the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe Tammany and Flynn interests in New York and Jake Arvey’s tight\r\nChicago combine are powers. The Rhode Island organization of Senator\r\nPastore and Attorney General McGrath, the crooked Connecticut machine\r\nthat made Senator Brien McMahon, and the Maryland organization, about\r\nwhich more later, get whatever they want. Senator Herbert O’Conor\r\nis the godfather of the Maryland outfit, and he is a member of the\r\nKefauver Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado machine handles the loot for the Mountain States. The\r\nerrand-boy for the West Coast gamblers, dope runners and procurers\r\nis the California Democratic organization, of which at this writing,\r\nJimmy Roosevelt is the chairman, but the mobsters don’t stick long with\r\nlosers.\r\n\r\nIn _Chicago Confidential_ we gave an outline of the organization and\r\nchain of command of the international underworld Syndicate.\r\n\r\nThe Mafia, an age-old institution, has existed in Sicily since before\r\nthe beginning of written history. Sicily always has been, and to this\r\nday is, subject territory. It was owned by ancient Phoenicians, Greeks,\r\nCarthaginians, Romans, Imperial France, Italy and even Britain. The\r\nSicilian peasants always worked for absentee owners.\r\n\r\nIn prehistoric times, the Mafia began as a patriotic terrorist society,\r\nsomewhat like the Irish Republican Army. Venal leaders sold out,\r\noffered protection to some estates while they sacked others. They\r\nanticipated the protection racket by centuries.\r\n\r\nThe Mafia and the dread Black Hand are the same thing. The black hand\r\nwas the sign over which the Mafia’s threats were delivered. During\r\nseveral thousand years it came about that almost every native of Sicily\r\nhad to have some tie or connection with the Mafia. Some were members,\r\nothers were relatives of members, or partners, hired killers and\r\nspies. Others did business with it; still others were the terrorized\r\nunattached who dared not refuse its bidding.\r\n\r\nSicilians vie with Cantonese as the most migrating people in the world.\r\nSicily, like Canton, is overpopulated and poverty-ridden. Another, more\r\nimportant factor, appears to be that at every change of government,\r\nMafistas were forced into flight and exile in droves. They settled and\r\ncolonized all over the earth. There are huge Sicilian colonies spread\r\naround Europe, in England, South America, North Africa, the Orient and\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nEvery Sicilian colony had a hard core of black-handers, who set up an\r\ninvisible government and preyed first on the other colonizers. The\r\nvarious groups were in correspondence with each other, cooperated in\r\nbusiness deals, provided places for other fugitives and expatriates.\r\n\r\nThe first great influx arrived in this country exactly a hundred years\r\nago, about the time Napoleon 3rd extended his influence to Sicily.\r\nThereafter, every ten or twenty years found other large groups on\r\ntheir way here, especially after such periods of uncertainty as the\r\nunification of Italy, World War I, the Mussolini ascendancy, and after\r\nWorld War II. From time to time the Italian government tried to wipe\r\nout the Mafia, and after each attempt thousands more came to wink and\r\nleer at the Statue of Liberty.\r\n\r\nThough the Italian government never could exterminate the Mafia, it did\r\nwipe out similar terroristic societies on the mainland, such as the\r\nCamorra, of Naples. The members of these other secret societies who\r\ncould escape fled to Sicily, where they were welcomed and integrated as\r\nbrothers by the Mafistas.\r\n\r\nTheir overseas affiliates were absorbed by local Mafia units. This\r\nprocess took place also among outlawed Greek secret societies, and the\r\ndread Black Hand of Serbia, which was akin in purpose to Sicily’s Black\r\nHand. Meanwhile, as Mafia bosses got fat and rich, they smuggled in new\r\nkillers, many from Cuba and Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThe American Black Hand was content to operate exclusively in Italian\r\ncircles for years. All Italians had to pay tribute, a tithe of their\r\nearnings, from the dollar-a-week of the corner bootblack to five\r\nthousand a night of Enrico Caruso. Failure to pay meant the Black\r\nHand letter, and continued failure, death. Now the Mafia is smoother.\r\nIt “owns” acts on a ten-per cent business deal. Frank Sinatra was\r\ndiscovered by Willie Moretti and is the pet of the Fischettis. He gave\r\na gold cigarette case to Charlie Luciano, inscribed “To my friend.”\r\n\r\nRecent developments in New York again demonstrate how this works.\r\nA $4,000-a-year city fireman, an Italian who had changed his name,\r\ntestified he was operating a $200,000 talent agency, which, in\r\ntheatrical parlance, “stole” acts from other agencies. Two were\r\n“thefted” from agent Lou Perry: Alan Dale, another Italian who is the\r\nhottest crooning find of the year, and Toni Arden. The fireman, whose\r\nname is Gerry Purcell, booked these two and another, Terri Stevens,\r\ninto the Copacabana, where all three “clicked” and started their climbs\r\nto fame.\r\n\r\nIn _Chicago Confidential_, we described how Big Jim Colosimo, then\r\nthe local Mafia leader, set up the organization which under Al Capone\r\nand Johnny Torrio, was able to drive out of Chicago all the competing\r\nnon-Italian and sectional mobs. Prohibition made them fabulously rich\r\nand potent.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened in New York. While Colosimo was the head of the\r\nChicago chapter, Lupo “the Wolf” Saietta headed the New York branch.\r\nAfter he went to prison, Joe “The Boss” Masseria took over, after a lot\r\nof mayhem.\r\n\r\nThey began to call the Mafia the Unione Siciliano then. At times it\r\ntried to pretend it was a respectable Italian-American benevolent\r\nsociety. Joe “The Boss” reigned at the top of the Unione for nine\r\nyears, until he was murdered in 1931. His chief lieutenants were\r\n“Lucky” Luciano and Frank Costello. When Masseria was killed they moved\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThe Irish and Jewish mobs were being driven to the wall. The same\r\nthing happened in every important city. By the middle 1930s, the\r\nUnione Siciliano was dominant in every racket. Wherever there were\r\nnon-Italians left, the only way they could do business was to accept\r\nthe overlordship of the Mafia. If they were good boys they were allowed\r\nto come in and get rich. If they tried any monkey-business, they were\r\nassassinated, like Bugsy Siegel, or turned over to the law, like Lepke\r\nand Gurrah.\r\n\r\nNo one knows whether the top Italian hoodlums like Capone, Luciano and\r\nCostello took over the Mafia, or whether the Mafia took them over. That\r\nis an academic conjecture, as they are now one and the same thing, with\r\nthe worldwide facilities of the Unione Siciliano the nucleus on which\r\nall organized vice, crime and corruption, not only in the United States\r\nbut all over the world, has been built.\r\n\r\nIn _Chicago Confidential_, we stated in passing that since the exile\r\nof Luciano in Italy the American “president” or executive head of the\r\nUnione Siciliano is Frank Costello, and the vice-president is Capone’s\r\ncousin, Charles Fischetti, in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe worldwide Mafia is composed of a supreme head in Palermo, Sicily,\r\na Grand Council consisting of high-ranking executives, subordinate\r\nofficers, and a global membership.\r\n\r\nLuciano, following his deportation in 1947, has been installed as the\r\nSupreme Head of the International Mafia. Members are divided into two\r\ndistinct groups, inner circle and outer circle. The latter includes\r\nmembers of ordinary rank and standards. The former consists of those\r\nwho command wealth, influence or proven underworld power. Membership in\r\nthis group is kept at a minimum, since it derives a major portion of\r\nall proceeds from its general diverse illegal enterprises.\r\n\r\nMembers of the elite few are almost invariably, through ancestry\r\nor direct birth, from Palermo and its adjoining areas. A very few\r\nnon-Italians have been taken into the ruling circle. According to the\r\nU.S. Bureau of Narcotics, American members of the Mafia are necessarily\r\nmembers of the over-all group, which therefore has continued to\r\ninclude former American gangsters who left the U.S. by deportation or\r\nvoluntary flight. Prominently mentioned among these are John Schillochi\r\n(International List 298); Dominic Petrelli (International List 259);\r\nand Nicola Gentile (International List 133), all of whom were in Italy\r\nwhen last heard of, though informants tell us they have since been seen\r\naround New York again.\r\n\r\nOther important members of the Mafia, such as Francisco Paolo Coppola\r\nand Sylvestro Carrolla, found their way to Mexico, where they took over\r\nthe local Mafia. Other lesser figures represent the fearsome fraternity\r\nin Canada, Argentina, Brazil, France, and England.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Narcotics has compiled what is believed to be the\r\nonly master list of the inner circle of the Mafia. It is based on\r\ndocumentary evidence in the form of address books, papers, interstate\r\ntelephone calls, police records, screened informants, etc. During the\r\nrecent Kefauver Committee hearings, Commissioner Anslinger supplied\r\nthe document under oath to the committee. Extracts from this list are\r\nprinted in the back of the book.\r\n\r\nEven before the Mafia had organized the entire American underworld, it\r\nhad strong communication lines into Washington. These were first built\r\nup during Prohibition, when the boys passed money back to the capital\r\nfor their own protection. They also made liberal contributions to the\r\ncampaign funds of dry Congressmen, without whose votes, for whatever\r\ncause, the racket was worthless. During the insane days of Prohibition,\r\nthe underworld began the process of undermining the honesty and probity\r\nof federal officials, which has since been carried to an extreme.\r\n\r\nUntil the 18th Amendment, law-breakers feared Uncle Whiskers. There\r\nwere few federal criminal laws. Most criminals didn’t want to tangle\r\nwith Washington. Only nuts got themselves mixed up with the postal\r\ninspectors or the Secret Service. After the wholesale bribery and\r\ncorruption of the 1920s, all respect for national law enforcement had\r\ngone into the ashcan.\r\n\r\nNow, due largely to the example of the F.B.I., the Bureau of Narcotics\r\nand the Treasury Intelligence, the public’s faith in federal\r\nlaw-enforcement and investigative agencies has been revived, but\r\nthe prosecuting and judicial ends have never come back. Most felons\r\nwould rather be arrested by federal than state or city cops, because\r\nthey know they can make a better deal with the prosecutors, and if\r\neverything fails, federal sentences are light and the prisons are soft.\r\n\r\nBefore the underworld was completely organized, Washington was a\r\n“neutral” city, where mob meetings and conventions were held. In such\r\ncities the delegates must not pack guns. Rough stuff is out by common\r\nconsent. Other such open cities are Saratoga, Hot Springs, Las Vegas,\r\nAtlantic City and Miami. These were and are important resort centers,\r\nand are kept neutral because machine-gunning might scare tourists away.\r\nWashington was no-man’s-land for obvious reasons; they knew tommy-guns\r\nwouldn’t be tolerated in the Capitol’s shadow.\r\n\r\nCommissioner Anslinger recalls such a gangster convention in the\r\nShoreham Hotel, two decades ago. The Commissioner dropped into the\r\nBlue Room for dinner and saw Luciano, “Machine Gun” Jack McGurn, Frank\r\nNitti, “the Enforcer” of the Chicago mob, Izzie Bernstein of Detroit’s\r\nPurple Gang, and three other hoods, each with a bejeweled blonde. They\r\nwere registered at the Shoreham under assumed names and spent a week\r\nthere holding meetings.\r\n\r\nWhen Anslinger lamped the boys, he went to the lobby and had Lucky\r\ncalled out. Luciano was offended, beefed about the interruption of his\r\nparty. He said, “You can’t do anything to me. We got Constitutional\r\nrights. We’re only sight-seeing.”\r\n\r\nAnslinger said, “That’s all you’d better do,” then glancing at the\r\nblondes, he added, “remember the Mann Act.”\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, Jack McGurn was knocked off. It developed that this\r\nmeeting was called for his trial. He had been getting out of line. So\r\nhe was summoned from Chicago to meet his peers from the other cities.\r\n\r\nThe organized underworld’s influence in official Washington is\r\nincalculable. Its direct ties, even to the top, are so firm that\r\nin many instances even a political revolution will not dislodge\r\nthem. They succeeded in doing that which the Communists failed to\r\ndo; they infiltrated and took over the government. They are the true\r\nsubversives, though that never comes out in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Mafia’s power is built around these factors:\r\n\r\n1) The underworld’s ownership of and contributions to local political\r\nmachines. The mob has no politics or ideology. It pays liberally to\r\nboth sides, so it will have a friend in court no matter who wins. Even\r\nthe former American Labor Party Congressman, Vito Marcantonio, was on\r\nintimate terms with Mafia hoodlums, accepted campaign contributions\r\nfrom them, associated with and fronted for their racketeers in New York\r\nand in Washington, and welcomed them into his American Labor Party. He\r\nappointed the son of the infamous “Three Finger Brown” Luchese to West\r\nPoint in 1946. Luchese was and is his contact in Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\n2) The Mafia’s huge cache of currency, hidden in private safe deposit\r\nvaults and in banks throughout the world. Its earnings from illicit\r\nsources are so great, and come in so fast, the boys cannot invest it\r\nfast enough. They must hide most of the money because they failed to\r\npay income tax on the major portion of it. It is no exaggeration to say\r\nthey have billions of dollars in U.S. bills. With this bankroll they\r\ncan bribe at will, elect many officials, and swing public opinion to\r\nincredible degrees.\r\n\r\n3) The Syndicate’s interests in countless large legitimate businesses\r\nand industries give it a responsible, respectable voice in Washington\r\nthrough trade associations, lobbyists, law firms, banks, Congressmen\r\nwho would do a favor for a local businessman but would not be seen dead\r\nwith a gangster, and a considerable segment of the press, daily and\r\nperiodical, and the radio.\r\n\r\n4) The hoodlums’ tie-up with some labor, which came about when\r\nunions needed sluggers, or when tough guys muscled in to grab union\r\ntreasurers, or used them as part of their extortion rackets. Lobbyists\r\nrepresenting the unions are feared and toadied to.\r\n\r\n5) The Italian voting bloc now controls some of the largest cities in\r\nthe country. It is the largest single unit in New York, where all three\r\ncandidates for mayor in 1950 were Italians. Too many of their men in\r\noffice have ties to the Mafia. They can count on the votes of their\r\ncountrymen in nominations and elections. The mass votes of Italians\r\nare bartered back and forth and usually can be delivered, by Black\r\nHand threats in Italian neighborhoods, by appeal to blood relationship\r\nand national pride, or through the pages of powerful Italian language\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nDuring his recent campaign, New York’s Mayor Impellitteri charged that\r\nGene Pope, publisher of Il Progresso Italiano-Americano, the biggest\r\nItalian daily in the country, was an intimate of Frank Costello. We\r\nhave seen them dining together on intimate terms.\r\n\r\nNo book could comprehensively cover the mob’s facets in Washington, but\r\nhere are a few, at random:\r\n\r\nThe President’s military aide and poker pal, Major General Harry\r\nVaughan, has associated with Frank Costello. They were brought together\r\nthrough his stooge, the convict John Maragon, who was a pal of the late\r\nBill Helis, Greek millionaire and partner in Costello’s New York and\r\nLouisiana enterprises--as well as in a Scotch distillery.\r\n\r\nJoe Adonis, New York mobster and lieutenant of Costello, had financial\r\ndealings with Harold F. Ambrose, former special assistant to the\r\nPostmaster General. Ambrose pleaded guilty to charges of operating a\r\n$600,000 fraudulent stamp-selling scheme. Adonis was questioned by the\r\nD.C. grand jury, but refused to talk, after which the United States\r\nhad amnesia about his connection with the case. Ambrose is related to\r\nDemocratic Senator O’Mahoney. His failure to go to trial protected his\r\nunderworld associates.\r\n\r\nAttorney General McGrath, who may be a U.S. Supreme Court Justice\r\nbefore this appears in print, was a Senator from Rhode Island and an\r\nimportant member of Rhode Island’s Democratic machine. That outfit has\r\ntight ties with the underworld. Within days after McGrath was pushed\r\nupstairs to the Attorney Generalship, to make way for Bill Boyle as\r\nDemocratic National Chairman, McGrath made a trip to New York City.\r\nThere he or his double had dinner at the Copacabana night club with\r\nJoe Nunan, former Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and Julie Podell,\r\nmanager of the cafe. It has been frequently charged in New York\r\nthat Costello has an interest in the corporation. The late Mayor La\r\nGuardia ordered police to cancel the club’s license if Podell, long an\r\nassociate of Costello, was ever found on its premises again. Podell,\r\nwhile giddy, told one of your reporters that Costello had advanced\r\n$50,000 to open the club.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the dinner party there, the Copa was a possible\r\ndefendant in a tax-action growing out of an investigation into the\r\ncharges that it was owned by Costello. Since then, Podell was in Hot\r\nSprings with Costello and several other mobsters from all parts of the\r\ncountry, in an annual convention. McGrath has since stated there is no\r\norganized crime or vice in the country.\r\n\r\nFormer Attorney General Tom Clark, now a Justice of the United States\r\nSupreme Court, was closely associated with attorneys who represented\r\nunderworld figures. There were no major underworld prosecutions\r\nduring his term of office. A Congressional investigation elicited the\r\nstartling information that Clark’s boyhood pal, Maury Hughes, a Dallas\r\nattorney, was retained by five members of the old Capone mob, who had\r\nbeen convicted of extorting millions from the movie industry, to induce\r\nthe federal authorities to nol-pros outstanding indictments against\r\nthem and secure premature paroles.\r\n\r\nHughes, with other lawyers close to the administration, worked this\r\nfeat of legal legerdemain. While these pages were being written,\r\nthe same Maury Hughes secretly succeeded in keeping Alan Smiley, a\r\nnotorious West Coast gangster who had been ordered deported, in the\r\ncountry. Smiley was Bugsy Siegel’s buddy, and was seated next to him on\r\na love-seat in Virginia Hill’s Beverly Hills mansion when Siegel was\r\nambushed and assassinated, in the only spot in the room visible to the\r\ntorpedoes hidden outside, in bushes.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, Smiley had been passing himself off as an oil broker\r\nand real estate man in Houston, Texas, where he lived with his wife, a\r\nformer movie starlet, in Glen McCarthy’s swank Shamrock Hotel. Smiley\r\ntook up with a Texas oilman, Lenoire Josey, who liked to gamble. Smiley\r\nsaid he liked that, too. He knew some good places.\r\n\r\nHe and Josey went to Sam Maceo’s ornate casino, the Balinese Room, in\r\nGalveston. Then they went to the Mounds Club, in Cleveland. After that\r\nthey went to the Flamingo, in Las Vegas. A trip to Phil Kastel’s (and\r\nCostello’s) beautiful Beverly, outside New Orleans, followed. When\r\nJosey counted up he had lost $500,000. Smiley “admitted to being a big\r\nloser, too.” If so, he got some back, because he owns a bit of stock in\r\nthe Flamingo.\r\n\r\nWhile these lines were being written, the California Crime Commission,\r\nheaded by Admiral William H. Standley, Retired, castigated government\r\naides for their ties with criminals. He said the relationship between\r\nthe underworld elements and certain officials “must of necessity make\r\nit embarrassing for Federal officials to undertake prosecutions.”\r\n\r\nA specific example was Sam Termini, described as a godson of the late\r\nCharlie Binaggio, who would have had to earn $900,000 income last year\r\nto be able to afford the cash payments made on his mansion in San Mateo\r\nCounty. He paid income tax on no such sum.\r\n\r\nIt cited the case of Dorothy A. McCreedy as a specific example of\r\ntieups between criminals and government officials, stating:\r\n\r\n“The McCreedy woman is a convicted madame, a major figure in the\r\nprostitution racket in California for years and operator of two large\r\nwhore-houses in Honolulu.”\r\n\r\nShe was reported to the Income Tax Bureau as a suspected evader, but\r\n“she is also a partner in a business called Safety Step Sales Co., and\r\none of her partners is Ernest M. Schino, chief field deputy in the\r\nOffice of the Collector of Internal Revenue.”\r\n\r\nThey tell a spicy story about Dorothy, whom we know well--personally,\r\nnot professionally. When F. D. Roosevelt made his first trip to Hawaii,\r\nthe Secret Service failed to send ahead a black open touring-car\r\nof expensive make, familiar and standard for the President on open\r\ndisplay. Honolulu was winnowed. Only one such car was found in the\r\nTerritory. It was owned by Dorothy, who used to drive her gals through\r\ntown, to show them off, for promotion.\r\n\r\nDorothy pridefully lent the car. Everyone in Honolulu recognized it\r\non sight, but the President didn’t know that. He flashed his historic\r\ngrin, waved his hat, but couldn’t understand why the cheers were\r\naccompanied by an obbligato of guffaws.\r\n\r\nIt was charged, and never refuted in the 1950 campaign, by both\r\nGovernor Dewey and Mayor Impellitteri that Ed Flynn, New York political\r\nboss and intimate of the late President Roosevelt, is Frank Costello’s\r\ncontact in New York State. Flynn, who has, and retained after the\r\ndebacle, the national patronage in the state, used it frequently to\r\nprocure appointments in high places, including the federal district\r\nbench, the New York State Supreme Court and some prosecutors, of men\r\nknown to be friendly to associates of Costello. His defeated choice for\r\ngovernor of New York, former Congressman Walter J. Lynch, of the Bronx,\r\nhad, while he was in Congress, introduced a “sleeper” which would have\r\npermitted the underworld kings, notorious for such frauds, to evade\r\nprison sentences for tax delinquency.\r\n\r\nA report, in the possession of the Los Angeles Police Department, which\r\nwe have seen, states that Flynn or someone who looked remarkably like\r\nhim--with Frank Costello, Phil Kastel and others--was in Mexico City in\r\nDecember, 1948. Costello was in conferences that contemplated taking\r\nover the Mexican National Lottery. The group was partied by A. C.\r\nBlumenthal, expatriate New York showman.\r\n\r\nLynch, like his boss Ed Flynn, was a never-deviating New Deal-Fair Deal\r\nDemocrat. He never voted against an administration measure. In the last\r\nCongress there was a mighty affinity between New Dealers and crooked\r\ndealers. For instance, former Senator Lucas, of Illinois, the majority\r\nleader, was beholden to the Nash-Kelly-Arvey machine. Appointments of\r\nshady figures to federal positions in Illinois cleared through him, the\r\nsenior Senator, as all must.\r\n\r\nLeft-wing Democratic Senator Hubert Humphrey, of Minnesota, is a pal\r\nof ex-convict Charles Ward, millionaire calendar printer. Ward has\r\nmany ties with the underworld all over the country, and was one of\r\nthe financial backers of Anna Roosevelt’s attempt to start a daily\r\nnewspaper in Phoenix, Arizona. This was once he was outsmarted in\r\na money deal. As is not unknown in the Roosevelt tradition, he got\r\none cent on the dollar back. Bill O’Dwyer said he found a direct tie\r\nbetween Ward and Brooklyn’s Murder, Inc.\r\n\r\nUnder such auspices, the underworld is establishing a firm grip on\r\nMinnesota. Its attempt to take over the Minneapolis and St. Paul\r\ntraction systems is a part of the general picture across the land\r\nand was exposed by Lait last summer in his _Daily Mirror_ column. It\r\nresulted in the indictment of one of the mobsters, Kid Cann, so called\r\nbecause of his many incarcerations.\r\n\r\nThe New Dealers have been kind to the underworld ever since their\r\nvictorious election in 1932, after Costello and Jimmy Hines, with\r\nEd Kelly, had successfully managed the convention fight in Chicago.\r\nWhile Frank Murphy was Attorney-General he saw to it that prosecuting\r\nattorneys laid off the boys. Internal Revenue agents prepared a tax\r\ncase against Costello and Frank Erickson, but the U.S. Attorney was\r\nordered to pigeonhole it.\r\n\r\nFollowing Frank Erickson’s conviction in New York on gambling charges,\r\nDistrict Attorney’s investigators seized his books and papers. Among\r\nthem was a memo reading, “Phone Daddy Long Legs.”\r\n\r\nThe sleuths jumped on this. They figured it was a code or nickname for\r\none of the mob aces. That is one of the toughest problems encountered\r\nby racket-busters, i.e., breaking down the aliases used by the kings of\r\nthe underworld on their books and in their records.\r\n\r\nThe gumshoes rushed over to the Island and interviewed Erickson in his\r\ncell.\r\n\r\n“Who is Daddy Long Legs?” they asked. “And what did you want to call\r\nhim for?”\r\n\r\nErickson laughed uproariously. “Why shouldn’t I phone him?” he\r\ninquired. “After all, I’m related to him by marriage and he’s the Vice\r\nPresident.”\r\n\r\nAfter the investigators had recovered from their shocks, this is what\r\nErickson told them:\r\n\r\n“An in-law of mine is an in-law of Barkley’s. Barkley visited me in my\r\nLong Island home. My grand-kids are crazy about him. They nicknamed him\r\n‘Daddy Long Legs.’”\r\n\r\nThe story of the Binaggio killing in Kansas City, anticipated in\r\n_Chicago Confidential_, is recent, but the full background of the case\r\nhas never been aired before.\r\n\r\nPresident Truman is and was a loyal member of his county Democratic\r\norganization. And as such--a party man who never split his ticket--he\r\nwas forced to go along, though unwillingly, when the Chicago hoodlums\r\nput Binaggio in as the leader.\r\n\r\nWhen the President first went into politics, the Mafia was just one of\r\nthe mobs. It had not organized the country. In the 1920s, most of the\r\nbig city machines were owned by Irish bosses, who were tied up with the\r\nlocal Irish underworld gangs. Each city was independent of all other\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, the conviction of Tom Pendergast by U.S. Attorney\r\nMaurice Milligan was a smashing victory for law and order. But it was,\r\nat the same time, a greater victory for the Capone and Costello mob.\r\nThere are high government cops--not friends of the administration,\r\neither--who have the wild idea that the only effect of Pendergast’s\r\nconviction was to permit Charley Fischetti’s ambassador to Kansas\r\nCity, Tony Gizzo, to put in his own man, Binaggio, as county leader.\r\nMilligan’s brother Tuck was counsel for Joe de Luca, a Mafia boss and\r\nconvicted dope smuggler, during and after his brother’s term as United\r\nStates attorney. Milligan prosecuted few Sicilian hoodlums. T-men\r\ndemanded 20 years for De Luca. Milligan’s office asked for only 3 for\r\nhis brother’s client; he was sprung shortly thereafter and the stool\r\npigeon who convicted him was murdered. We looked up the official record\r\nand that is so.\r\n\r\nAs new Democratic leader of the President’s home county, Binaggio had\r\ngreat influence. Naturally, the President wanted to carry his own state\r\nin local and federal elections, so he had to work through his home\r\norganization. The presence in it of people like Binaggio and Gizzo may\r\nhave turned his stomach, but that was politics.\r\n\r\nWe have explained that the Big Mob does not operate directly in\r\nWashington on the street and sewer levels, such enterprises being\r\nfranchised out to locals. The Syndicate does do business in the\r\nDistrict in connection with its legitimate affairs and some of\r\nits larger sub-rosa undertakings. In the latter category are\r\nblack-marketing, the sale and resale of government surplus, padding\r\nof war contracts, etc. The boys had an office in the Thomas Circle\r\nBuilding during World War II, in which they dished out war contracts.\r\nOne day a man was killed there, but so great was their influence that\r\nno record was made on the police blotter. The newspapers still know\r\nnothing about it.\r\n\r\nA couple of hotels in Washington are owned by interests known to be\r\nbacked by underworld coin. Many chain stores owned by mob money have\r\nbranches there. Money of “Lepke” Buchalter, executed head of Murder,\r\nInc., is in Jarwood’s men’s clothing store, across the street from the\r\nDepartment of Justice. The history of this chain makes a human interest\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nWhen Lepke surrendered, to be turned over to J. Edgar Hoover, he\r\nunderstood the boys put in a “fix” so he would be tried on federal\r\ncharges and not turned over to Brooklyn’s crusading District Attorney,\r\nBill O’Dwyer, on the Murder, Inc., rap, which meant the chair in Sing\r\nSing.\r\n\r\nBut Hoover would have nothing to do with such a deal, and gave him up\r\nto New York State. Lepke was convicted of first-degree murder. He knew\r\nhe had been railroaded by the Mafia, which had wanted to get rid of\r\nits Jewish partner. He threatened to blow the whistle, and was promised\r\nleniency if he would talk. His wife, an attractive brunette, went to\r\nsee him in his cell and told him her life had been threatened, she\r\nwould be croaked if he spilled. That was not so. Lepke loved her, so he\r\nwent to the hot seat with his lips sealed to protect her.\r\n\r\nMost of his illegal profits had been stashed away in secret safe\r\ndeposit vaults. He told her where they were. While Lepke was in\r\nthe death-chamber, his wife was often seen with Arthur Jawitz, a\r\nslick-looking young guy, who had attracted the attention of the Feds\r\nwhen they were looking for Lepke, whose bed he was keeping warm.\r\n\r\nShortly after Lepke’s electrocution, his widow married the black-haired\r\nyoung man, and set him up in the men’s clothing business. They changed\r\ntheir name to Jarwood. The underworld says Lepke left her $20,000,000\r\nin U.S. currency. A former wife of Jawitz showed up, charged he had\r\nmarried Betty Buchalter bigamously. She said Betty was “keeping” Jawitz\r\nwhile her gangster husband was still alive.\r\n\r\nAfter the Kefauver Committee quizzed Lou Wolfson, head of the Capital\r\nTransit Company, which owns the street-cars and buses in Washington,\r\nseeking gangster-ties, it went no further. There was no evidence.\r\nWolfson, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida, says he is a legitimate\r\nbusinessman. We have no knowledge to the contrary. But it was developed\r\nunder oath at a Senatorial hearing that Wolfson and one William B.\r\nJohnston had, between them, raised a fund of half-a-million dollars for\r\nthe campaign of Florida’s governor, Fuller Warren. Wolfson and Johnston\r\neach put $154,000 into this private, special campaign kitty, and were\r\nintimately associated during the campaign. Johnston is president\r\nof Sportsman’s Park racetrack in Chicago, and several dog-tracks\r\nin Florida, which were owned by the late Al Capone. Johnston makes\r\nfrequent payments to Capone associates as “loans.” He admitted he had\r\nbeen associated with mob-owned enterprises.\r\n\r\nAnother witness, Leo J. Carroll, testified that it was general\r\nknowledge in 1948, that with the election of Governor Warren, one-third\r\nof whose campaign Wolfson financed, “the Mob would take over Florida.”\r\nIt did.\r\n\r\nA few months after Wolfson secured control of the Washington transit\r\nsystem, he was permitted to raise the fare to 15 cents a ride, on the\r\nplea of extreme poverty. Right after that, the company doubled its\r\nquarterly dividends from 50 cents to $1 a share. Company stock scored\r\na sensational advance, reaching $39. When Wolfson landed control he\r\nbought 109,000 shares at $20.\r\n\r\nWolfson’s campaign to buy the local transit system was authorized by\r\nthe ICC and the Securities Exchange after an adverse recommendation\r\nof the examiner and over opposition of minority stockholders. In less\r\nthan ten months, the Wolfson group succeeded in dominating the board of\r\ndirectors and placing its own men in strategic executive spots, one of\r\nwhom is Frank E. Weakly, president of the Wardman Park Hotel.\r\n\r\nNow the SEC has granted Wolfson permission to sell some of his stock\r\nat the inflated price, which gives him the company and his money back.\r\nAt this writing, he is negotiating to buy the Washington Redskins from\r\nGeorge Marshall.\r\n\r\nYou can feel the presence of the mob in Washington. You can see\r\nevidence in many directions that it is there. John L. Laskey,\r\nimmediate past president of the District Bar Association, resigned\r\nthe chairmanship of its law enforcement committee because he\r\nhad represented three witnesses called before the Senate Crime\r\nInvestigating Committee in connection with Florida gambling. He was a\r\nformer U.S. attorney.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank Costello testified briefly last year before the Senate\r\nInterstate Commerce Committee investigating the transportation of\r\nslot-machines across state lines, the photo of a Senate attache calling\r\na cab for him while Capitol policemen pushed nosy spectators away,\r\nwas widely published. But what hasn’t been printed is that a table\r\nwas reserved for him in advance in the Senators’ private dining-room\r\nin the Capitol, and while the great Costello dined with his staff of\r\nlawyers, a couple of U.S. Senators humbly waited for seats. The Senate\r\ndining-room is operated on a concession basis by the son-in-law of a\r\nChicago vending-machine manufacturer.\r\n\r\nIt could be some of the Senators are on Costello’s payroll. The law\r\nfirms of at least 40 Senators and Congressmen regularly represent the\r\nwire service and local gamblers in their home towns.\r\n\r\nNow let’s gander the Kefauver Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26. TERROR FROM TENNESSEE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House and the Senate have unlimited power and initiative in one\r\nfunction only--they can investigate anything.\r\n\r\nNo President can veto a resolution for an investigation or by law curb\r\nits activities or its scope. Theoretically, the purpose is to acquire\r\nfacts on which to base future legislation. Some of the mightiest of\r\nour historical moves have sprung from such inquiries. Giants have\r\nrisen in the course of them. Harry Truman would probably have remained\r\nan obscure little nonentity were it not that he became chairman of a\r\ncomparatively inconsequential Senate body which got to asking questions.\r\n\r\nOne of the surest ways to grab public attention is for a legislator to\r\npropose a resolution for a special investigation. If it passes it is\r\nnot submitted to a standing committee, but its author is by established\r\ncustom chosen as its chairman.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a special Senatorial investigating committee.\r\nIn many ways it is typical of such things under the Fair Deal, where\r\npolitics can strangle this last independent prerogative of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe central character of this tale is Estes Kefauver, who sprung a\r\nSenate motion to investigate crime. Your authors have a personal\r\nproperty right in this venture. For Senator Kefauver had read _Chicago\r\nConfidential_, and what he found there made his hair stand on end. This\r\nis no conjecture. His resolution was prompted by what we had discovered\r\nand published.\r\n\r\nHe was sincere, impulsive and ambitious--if you can call a yen to be\r\nVice-President an ambition. He is our friend, and as such we wish\r\nhim well and, as Americans who know a little more than most of their\r\nfellow-citizens about what is going on, we cheered the possibilities of\r\nan untrammeled turning of the turf that would show up officially any\r\nimportant portion of the staggering facts for which we risked our lives.\r\n\r\nKefauver began bravely. He realized that he had lightning bolts in both\r\nhands; that he not only could become one of the foremost men of his\r\ntime, but that he could accomplish priceless service to his country.\r\nWith the infinite power that was his, he could expose and perhaps\r\ndestroy the Syndicate and the Mafia which rules it, and save us from\r\nthe creeping, leaping conspiracy of criminals which already in many\r\nelements of our life has superseded constituted government.\r\n\r\nBut he wants to be Vice-President.\r\n\r\nAt this writing, he is 47; Barkley is 73. Political wisdom would\r\ndictate that the second man on the next national Democratic ticket\r\nshould come from a border state. Kefauver is from Tennessee. He became\r\na headliner when he licked boss Ed Crump. He is of Dutch-American stock\r\nand a Protestant.\r\n\r\nHe has four years more on his Senate term and could be re-elected. But\r\nfor a national nomination one needs a majority of the delegates at a\r\nconvention. Delegates are party men, designated by the party.\r\n\r\nHe had no more than taken his first bold steps when the party went to\r\nwork on him. No Democrat can fight the Mafia and get anything from most\r\nDemocrats except obstruction. They are so intimately and intricately\r\ninterwoven with the underworld plunderworld through all political\r\nstrata that they must protect it.\r\n\r\nKefauver was too naive to foresee this. He comes from one of the few\r\nstates where there is no gangsterism except in picayune city and county\r\naffairs, and in those the Republicans share the chicken-feed rewards.\r\nKefauver campaigned in a coonskin cap and unhorsed the Memphis machine,\r\nwhich had no great state-wide strength from within and no tie-ups to\r\nbring it help from without. But the explosion that followed when his\r\nbill passed rocked the whole national party.\r\n\r\nKefauver, in his innocence, had read our book of disclosures, but\r\nlike thousands of others, he failed to grasp the significance of the\r\npolitical forces which have become integrated with the system, without\r\nwhich it could not have spread, and to which it has contributed and\r\ndoes contribute incalculable money, leadership and votes. It was\r\ninconceivable to him that mayors and governors he knew and many of the\r\nstatesmanlike Senators with whom he mingled, could be beholden to, not\r\nto say slaves of, swarthy, sinister men, many of them ex-convicts, who\r\ntraffic in bodies of women, making and supplying dope-fiends, dealing\r\nin extortion, smuggling, bootlegging, hijacking, bribing and murdering\r\nin the principal cities and states of the union; that these hyenas were\r\na controlling influence in nominations and elections; that they owned\r\nvast commercial and industrial enterprises, labor unions, even some\r\nnewspapers, and that their pirate hands gripped the steering wheels of\r\nenormous financial fleets.\r\n\r\nHe read it. But he couldn’t believe it. And what he did believe of it\r\nhe couldn’t digest.\r\n\r\nNow he finds himself in the middle of a giant whitewash. He is the\r\nchump whose good name is used to shield the key figures of the Mafia\r\nand obfuscate their tie-up with the big city Democratic machines. He\r\ndoes not admit it publicly but he is heartbroken.\r\n\r\nSenate Republicans, seeking an issue, jumped in to support the proposed\r\ninvestigation. Kefauver’s bill at once became a hot potato the\r\nDemocrats couldn’t drop.\r\n\r\nDave Niles, Bill Boyle, J. Howard McGrath, and Scott Lucas huddled.\r\nThey found it was too late to sidetrack the proposed investigation;\r\nit had to go on, but with “sensible” safeguards. Suggestions that\r\nthe probe be transferred to other committees were waved aside as\r\nimpractical; it was necessary to have a front for this and Kefauver\r\nwas perfect for the job. He is a man of personal honesty, with no\r\nembarrassing machine or underworld connections.\r\n\r\nThe committee was voted, but with the surprising proviso that the\r\nVice President should name the minority party members. This was\r\nunprecedented. Minority leaders always choose their own committee\r\nmembers. The purpose of this tactic was to deal Michigan Senator Homer\r\nFerguson, the Republican’s top investigator, out. Membership was\r\nlimited to five, three Democrats and two Republicans. Thereupon Vice\r\nPresident Barkley followed orders, named two GOPers, one harmless.\r\nBoth were in the middle of violent primary campaigns, fighting for\r\npolitical survival. It was known they could not spend much time with\r\nthe committee. Wiley, a good man, is a ranking minority member of\r\nthe Foreign Relations Committee. He was kept close to that post by\r\nthe Korean mess. Julius Cahn, Wiley’s intelligent aide, was rendered\r\nimpotent. And Tobey is more a New Dealer than most Democrats. He got\r\ncampaign support from the administration, and in payment gratuitously\r\nbut muddle-headedly blamed gambling in New York on Dewey.\r\n\r\nThe motor of a Senatorial investigating committee is its counsel and\r\nthe staff. The members have other duties, must attend other committee\r\nmeetings, must be on the floor for roll-calls. And they are not\r\nusually professional prosecutors. They are at the mercy of their staffs.\r\n\r\nThat’s when the shenanigans began. Kefauver had no experience with such\r\nshenanigans. He didn’t know whom to retain. Tom Murphy, Alger Hiss’\r\nnemesis and later Police Commissioner of New York, was recommended. But\r\nMurphy was persona non grata in Washington because he had guts enough\r\nnot to throw the Hiss prosecution, after he had learned that would\r\nplease the Attorney General’s office.\r\n\r\nDave Niles told Kefauver to ask Ferdinand Pecora for advice. Pecora,\r\nthen a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court, was getting by on\r\nthe reputation of having exposed the money barons of Wall Street in the\r\nearly 1930’s. Pecora is a thoroughgoing New Dealer and Kefauver is one\r\nof the faithful. They failed to tell the man from Tennessee that Pecora\r\nis Bronx boss Ed Flynn’s man. Flynn is head of the machine in which\r\nFrank Costello is a power. Pecora attended Costello’s celebrated party\r\nat the Copacabana nightclub, with half the local bench, a number of\r\njurists who owed their robes to Costello.\r\n\r\nPecora recommended his protégé, Rudolph Halley, of the law firm of\r\nFulton, Walter and Halley, for counsel and Felix Frankfurter phoned\r\nto confirm it. Halley had been on the staff of the Truman Committee\r\nwhen Fulton was its chief counsel, so he looked good to Estes as an\r\nexperienced prober. But Halley had been an attorney for the Hudson &\r\nManhattan Railroad, in which it was alleged underworld characters owned\r\nstock. Kefauver told your reporters he had heard a rumor Halley might\r\nhave represented them, and had asked him about it before hiring him.\r\nKefauver looked us in the eyes and stated, “Halley said it wasn’t so.\r\nNaturally, I took his word for it.”\r\n\r\nAfter the Kefauver Committee had been functioning some months, Halley\r\nadmitted to your reporters before witnesses, that he knew there were\r\nlarge underworld holdings in that company, which had been his client.\r\nWe have a sworn affidavit which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Halley stated that the statement in the book _Chicago\r\nConfidential_, to the effect that the underworld syndicate has bundles\r\nof stock in the Hudson & Manhattan tubes, was substantially correct;\r\nthat it was his own personal knowledge, as former counsel for the\r\nHudson & Manhattan Railroad, that the underworld owned large blocks of\r\nstock in that company.”\r\n\r\nAfter a change in management, Halley was dismissed from the H & M,\r\nand went to work for the Kefauver Committee at $120 a week. The new\r\nmanagement of the railroad said it had virtually eliminated suspicious\r\nstockholders and emasculated shady directors who could not be fired.\r\n\r\nAmong the investigators hired by the committee were ex-cops,\r\ndisappointed lawyers and the usual Washington hanger-on-ers,\r\nrecommended for jobs by influential friends.\r\n\r\nKefauver’s principal source of information about the underworld was\r\nwhat he had read in _Chicago Confidential_, He knew no more. He asked\r\nMortimer to take a leave of absence from his newspaper and act as paid\r\nadviser to the committee. Mortimer accepted, but said that he would\r\ntake no compensation. Over the weekend, Kefauver withdrew his offer in\r\na telegram in which he blamed other Senators. He said they feared other\r\nnewspapermen would be offended. That was an alibi, quickly arranged\r\nwhen influential Democrats vetoed the idea. But he took advice from Nat\r\nPerlow, editor of the Police Gazette!\r\n\r\nAt the first open hearing of the committee, subpenaed gamblers\r\nwere represented by Morris Shenker, St. Louis lawyer, formerly on\r\nthe Missouri Democratic committee. As a result of his good work in\r\nobtaining campaign donations, Shenker was named by Bill Boyle to the\r\nDemocratic finance committee. He hastily resigned after the deal was\r\nexposed in Lait’s column.\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made to keep Kefauver concentrated on gambling.\r\nSyndicate heads know the nation is not shocked over bookmaking.\r\nWhenever witnesses or informers got hot on narcotics, the spine of the\r\nSyndicate system, or began to talk about the huge investments of the\r\nunderworld in legitimate business, they were brushed off. There were\r\nrumors of fixes, payoffs and other such skulduggery, though Kefauver\r\nwas absolutely in the clear. But whenever he was warned such things\r\nwere happening, Kefauver, a softie at heart, who believes evil of no\r\none, said it was impossible.\r\n\r\nThough he promised your reporters his committee would hold open\r\nhearings in New York and Chicago before election, at which no punches\r\nwould be pulled, he folded up like a frightened puppy. After one day in\r\nNew York, at which no one of importance was questioned, the committee\r\nadjourned until after the election, with the statement that Joe Adonis,\r\nwho had been allegedly sought for 90 days, was unavailable. Your\r\nreporters saw Adonis every night at the corner of 50th Street and\r\nBroadway while committee investigators were supposed to be searching\r\nfor him. While the great man-hunt was supposed to be on, Adonis\r\nvoluntarily surrendered himself to New Jersey authorities who wanted to\r\nprosecute him for gambling.\r\n\r\nWhen asked why Costello hadn’t been called before election, a committee\r\nspokesman stated “We have nothing to ask Mr. Costello.”\r\n\r\nSimilar wariness was shown in Chicago. When former police captain Dan\r\nGilbert, who was Jake Arvey’s hand-picked candidate for sheriff of\r\nCook County, was on the stand at a secret hearing, he was questioned\r\nabout his wealth. Your authors had exposed him as the richest cop in\r\nthe world, a millionaire. Gilbert’s salary had never topped $9,000\r\na year, yet he admitted at the closed hearing he owned more than\r\n$350,000--which he said he had acquired through “speculation.” The\r\ncommittee dropped it then. Senator Kefauver, in an interview, said,\r\n“Captain Gilbert was a forthright witness.” When the _Chicago Sun\r\nTimes_, a Democratic New Deal newspaper, got hold of the minutes of\r\nthe secret hearing and splashed the text on Page 1 a few days before\r\nelection, Kefauver threatened to hold someone in contempt for the\r\nleak. Yet the committee did not explain why this information of public\r\ninterest had been bottled up before election, and why Gilbert’s bank\r\naccounts and securities had not been scrutinized.\r\n\r\nLater, Kefauver imperiously “directed” Eugene C. Pulliam, publisher\r\nof the _Indianapolis Star_ and _News_, “to discontinue” publication\r\nof a series exposing gambling as revealed by previous committee\r\ninvestigations, under penalty of a contempt citation.\r\n\r\nWhile Estes was threatening other newspapermen with jail, columnist\r\nDrew Pearson, his fervent supporter, was permitted to obtain access\r\nto secret committee records, including highly confidential income tax\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\nWherever the committee held hearings, its staff tried to pick on the\r\nlittle guys, fingered as the goats. The procedure in Miami was to put\r\nsix local Jewish bookmakers out of business. The Mafia was muscling in\r\non them anyway. The dispossessed were scheduled to be closed up so the\r\nChicago Sicilian mob would have clear sailing in Miami as soon as the\r\nhullabaloo about the crime investigation blew over next year.\r\n\r\nOnly half-hearted efforts were made to locate important figures.\r\nWhere, at any time, any were questioned or threatened with contempt, it\r\nwas because the situation was so wide open that no cover-up could be\r\nattempted without bringing the newspapers down.\r\n\r\nAt this writing, Harry Russell, Chicago hoodlum, is the only\r\nrecalcitrant witness brought to trial. He’s a small potato, a Jew\r\ntaking the rap for the Mafia.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Committee has been that witnesses could refuse to\r\nincriminate themselves only on federal offenses, but that if it was\r\nstate prosecution they feared, they had no immunity--tenuous reasoning\r\nany way you look at it, though many lawyers say it’s legal.\r\n\r\nBut Kefauver has been letting his enthusiasm get the better of him, and\r\nrecently stated at an open hearing, “Don’t think we’re going to let\r\nyou get away with this. We are working closely with local prosecutors\r\nand will turn our records over, particularly where anyone defies this\r\ncommittee.”\r\n\r\nThough no comment appeared in the papers, the mob lawyers knew he\r\nhad played into their hands. He might have made the contempt stick\r\nbefore; now, however, since he himself has stated he’s acting as an\r\nagent for the states--though unofficial--it’s a million to one not one\r\nrecalcitrant witness will be convicted.\r\n\r\nThe only state in which the committee got tough before election was\r\nPennsylvania, where the municipal machines are Republican. In New York,\r\nboss Flynn and Tammany were unmolested, and the onus was put on Dewey\r\nfor having tolerated gambling in Saratoga. There was no mention that\r\nwhen Lehman, F.D.R.’s “good right arm,” was governor, gambling was just\r\nas wide open there, and more so.\r\n\r\nOne of your reporters remembers seeing a limousine with New York State\r\nlicense Number 1 parked under the portico of Piping Rock, a notorious\r\nand expensive Saratoga gambling joint run by Luciano. That was Governor\r\nLehman’s car. It is possible his chauffeur was inside playing dominoes.\r\n\r\nBut the strategy of the Democratic brain-trust miscarried. People in\r\nNew York knew Costello was running the town and trying to get control\r\nof the state, even when the Senate committee, with all its power\r\nand money, fiddled and twiddled. Chicagoans knew the Fischettis and\r\nCapones, Boss Arvey, Dan Gilbert and Senator Scott Lucas were political\r\nbedfellows, which charge was aired daily in the papers during the 1950\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nWherever the committee gave the Democrats a clean bill, the people\r\nrebelled and kicked them out, most frequently on just that issue. But,\r\nwhere the committee had tried to show the underworld is tied up with\r\nRepublicans, as in Pennsylvania, the GOP scored a great victory.\r\n\r\nThe two Democratic members of the committee, in addition to Kefauver,\r\nare Lester Hunt, of Wyoming, and Herbert O’Conor of Maryland. Where\r\nHunt comes from, “crime” means cattle-rustling and claim-jumping.\r\nO’Conor, however, is the Democratic leader of the Maryland\r\norganization, which is in cahoots with one of the tightest and biggest\r\nMafia concentrations in the country. Not only were no hearings held in\r\nMaryland before election, but Kefauver refused to send investigators\r\ninto Prince Georges County, described heretofore as one of the most\r\nvicious crime spots of the country, even when citizens implored him to.\r\n\r\nInstead of cracking down on murderers, procurers and dope-peddlers, the\r\ncommittee wasted time, money and effort on an investigation of comics.\r\nAn effort was made to label the strips as the chief cause of America’s\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\nThe Senate investigating committee has, through ignorance or by design,\r\nbeen playing directly into the hands of the Mafia. Most Syndicate\r\nkey figures no longer have anything personally to do with gambling,\r\nexcept as bankers and protectors. Gambling is a seasonal business and\r\ninvestigations and clean-ups are discounted in advance, like rain in\r\nbaseball economy and warm weather in Sun Valley. These catastrophes are\r\naveraged off over a long period. The computations contemplate temporary\r\ndroughts at the street level. Except for a few who will go to the can\r\nfor a few months and be paid for their time, nothing is disturbed.\r\nBookmakers still take bets right outside the Senate committee room.\r\n\r\nIf no gambling casinos run in Miami this winter they will next winter.\r\nMeanwhile, those who want to gamble will fly to Havana, where the same\r\nmob operates the wheels and crap games. Anyway, you can still bet on\r\nthe nags in Miami, clean-up or no. At this writing, at least two fully\r\nequipped casinos are operating in the area.\r\n\r\nBut while the committee was grabbing front pages with its gambling\r\nexposures, the big boys were immune in the affairs that really matter\r\nto them, like manipulation of the stock market, black marketing,\r\nsmuggling, counterfeiting, dope and other forms of profitable\r\ndeviltry, the proceeds of which they invest in real estate and\r\nsecurities, so that as of now, the crime cartel is more potent in the\r\nmoney marts of the world than all the highbinders so long hissed at,\r\nthe “international bankers.”\r\n\r\nAfter Col. George White, Commr. Anslinger’s ace investigator, on loan\r\nto the Committee, was withdrawn, Scott Lucas high-pressured Truman\r\nto penalize White. White had turned up evidence that beat Lucas in\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nPurposely or not, Halley even helped the giggling gangsters get rid\r\nof the few rivals who remained. Few Sicilians got a going-over; but\r\nthe heat was turned on the handful of Jewish and Irish cheaters who\r\nsurvived.\r\n\r\nPersonally, Kefauver is a delightful and appealing personage, tall,\r\na former football-player with the charm of an F.D.R. and the fine,\r\ndelicate features of a Woodrow Wilson. He may well be your next Vice\r\nPresident. After that--well, any American boy with no such start could\r\nbe. His friends kid him and accuse him of saying “Good morning, Mr.\r\nPresident” every morning when he looks in the mirror as he shaves.\r\nKefauver frowns at this. He says, “The Chief in the White House will\r\nget sore.”\r\n\r\nKefauver’s main weakness is that he is a Don Quixote for “causes”\r\n(except FEPC), has too much energy and tries to do too many things. He\r\nis on almost every regular and special committee it is possible for a\r\nSenator to make, so hasn’t time to do justice to any. He is in modest\r\ncircumstances, cannot be bought or bribed, though he could have had\r\nmillions to throw the investigation--as it is being thrown anyway. Many\r\nbelieve some of that money went elsewhere, without his knowledge.\r\n\r\nAn employe of the committee, whose name will not be divulged by us,\r\ndisgusted by what went on, unburdened himself. He said “a fix was\r\nmade in Miami” to relieve a certain wanted hoodlum from testifying;\r\nand that another deal was put over in Chicago to protect some of the\r\nmost important Mafistas. A fund was raised in Hollywood to choke off\r\ndisclosures.\r\n\r\nOne investigator had as a chief recommendation, other than brief\r\nservice with the F.B.I., that he had been a cop in a mid-Western city.\r\nWith this background he was sent in to “bust” the mob in New York, a\r\njob that many District Attorneys couldn’t do. He knew so little of New\r\nYork that he had to ask how to get to Times Square.\r\n\r\nThis investigator, “unable” to find Joe Adonis during a 90-day search,\r\nwas very diligent when it came to finding himself a new, high-paying\r\njob. During the course of an investigation into mob control of\r\nlegitimate business, it was testified that one Bill Giglio, now under\r\nindictment on a tax rap, had “muscled” into a sugar and candy company\r\nduring the last war, and that as a result of such activities he now\r\nowned a research and development laboratory, the entire output of which\r\nwas being sold to a large and respected chemical corporation.\r\n\r\nWhile going over Giglio’s books the Kefauver man naturally had occasion\r\nto call on the large corporation, and he ingratiated himself with its\r\nofficers, who were not called to testify in Washington. The result was\r\nthat, right smack in the middle of the Kefauver investigations, this\r\ndick quit to head up the plant-security set-up of the big corporation,\r\nwhich now has a lot of war contracts.\r\n\r\nBut the payoff is that, a couple of years ago, before the Kefauver\r\nCommittee was thought of, the same fellow was in charge of security at\r\na Long Island plant making restricted military products. There it was\r\ndiscovered that the future Kefauver agent was protecting the bookmakers\r\nin the plant, and he was booted out after the F.B.I. was tipped off.\r\nThe book at this plant was operated by Joe Adonis. Kefauver was so\r\ninformed, but did not fire his agent.\r\n\r\nFederal and state enforcement agencies are squawking that the mob is\r\ngetting access to confidential files through leaks in the committee.\r\n\r\nBut if the committee had wanted to probe, the goods were in reach.\r\nIndividuals all over the country sought to put facts in its hands.\r\nWhenever possible, those who managed the investigations looked the\r\nother way.\r\n\r\nBill Drury, the honest Chicago ex-police captain, who was slain by\r\ngunmen last September, might have been alive now were it not for this\r\ncommittee. We were in constant communication with Drury, in fact Jack\r\nLait received a letter from him in New York the morning after he was\r\nassassinated. Almost his last act was mailing it. When the committee\r\nfirst got under way, your authors suggested to Kefauver that he hire\r\nDrury and his partner, Captain Tom Connelly, as investigators. These\r\nmen knew more first-hand about the underworld than almost anyone alive.\r\nCounsel Halley interposed. He told us the men were not “reliable,”\r\nbecause they had been fired from the Chicago police force. That was\r\ntheir chief recommendation to us. They had been rooked out of the\r\ncrookedest force in the country because they were fearless, honest and\r\nuntouchable.\r\n\r\nWe told Kefauver the only way he could convince us his investigation\r\nwas on the up-and-up was to hire these men. He promised us he would.\r\nThat was in July, 1950.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Drury and Connelly sought to contact Kefauver, failing which\r\nthey tried to get in touch with Halley and the chief investigator of\r\nthe committee. They hated the mob so hotly, they offered to work for\r\nnothing, though they were poor men. Had Drury been retained as an\r\ninvestigator, he’d still be living. No cop has ever been killed except\r\nin actual combat. The underworld never murders a policeman who is going\r\nabout his business. But an ex-cop--yoho.\r\n\r\nA lot of misinformation has been published about what preceded the\r\nactual assassination, last September 25. After his death, committee\r\nemployes realized they would have to explain Drury’s frequent phone\r\ncalls. A story was dreamed up in Chicago to the effect that Drury\r\nwas seeking “protection” and that Halley, after a couple of weeks’\r\nconsideration, had agreed to arrange for it. That runs for the end\r\nbook. Drury never asked anyone for protection. He was the bravest man\r\nwe ever knew. He often traveled without a gun, but the mobsters feared\r\nhis fists more than bullets. We spoke to him a few days before he died.\r\nHe was not frightened. He was angry. He told us he had been trying to\r\ncontact committee investigators for weeks to give them information. He\r\nsaid that ever since he had outlined to them what he was prepared to\r\nprove he got brushed off when he called again.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic _Chicago Sun-Times_ charged categorically that Drury\r\nwas rubbed out because someone on the Kefauver Committee “leaked”\r\nto the mobsters what Drury said he had the goods on. He told us his\r\ninvestigations implicated someone on the committee’s staff.\r\n\r\nA few days after the murder, Kefauver phoned us long distance to\r\ntell us to get all our records and correspondence concerning Drury\r\ntogether as he was going to subpena us at once, in an effort to solve\r\nthe cowardly crime. That was October 1, 1950. As these words were\r\nbeing typed in February, 1951, the subpena remained unserved and the\r\nassassination unpunished.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Lait and Mortimer were under considerable pressure\r\nfrom important personages, Republicans as well as Democrats, “to lay\r\noff Halley,” and place the blame for the miscarriage of the Kefauver\r\ncommittee on the chairman instead of on his staff. We refused to be\r\nbought, bribed, threatened or intimidated.\r\n\r\nBy resolution, the original life of the committee was until February\r\n28, but it is probable that additional hearings will be authorized for\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\nThe plan, as this went to press, was to save all the fireworks for\r\na final blow-out in New York, at which the glamor pusses of the\r\nunderworld, such as Virginia Hill, dubbed by us “Mafia Rose,” would\r\nbe called for the publicity value. Virginia was served with much\r\nhullabaloo in September, but was saved six months to hypo the last act.\r\nFrank Costello was also slated to be called if he “cared to talk.”\r\n\r\nThe big boys have brazenly stood on their “constitutional rights”\r\non the advice of high-priced counsel who assured them their chances\r\nagainst conviction on contempt, which is a misdemeanor punishable by a\r\nyear in a Federal “country club,” were about a hundred to one.\r\n\r\nIt was decided by the Mafia Grand Council that if things got too hot,\r\nCostello would have to be the goat. He has been getting too much\r\npublicity for the conservative rulers of the Unione, who still live in\r\ncold-water tenements with fat old-country wives.\r\n\r\nThey resent the airs put on by the glamor-boy hoods, who, they feel,\r\nand with some justification, are putting the finger of the law on the\r\nsyndicate.\r\n\r\nOne Mafia faction is for going further. In the event the spotlight hits\r\nCostello his number is up. He has so been told by Tony Ricci, alias\r\nGoebels, who manages many such things.\r\n\r\nWe have not seen it, nor have we any confidential information about the\r\ncontents of the committee’s final report, but we are willing to bet it\r\nwill be along these lines:\r\n\r\n  1) There is crime.\r\n\r\n  2) No political party has the monopoly on it.\r\n\r\n  3) There seems to be a Mafia.\r\n\r\n  4) Gamblers should pay their income tax.\r\n\r\n  5) Kids should go to Sunday school.\r\n\r\n  6) Communities should appoint Crime Prevention Societies.\r\n\r\n  7) Because of the international situation, let’s forget it and call\r\n     the whole thing off.\r\n\r\nThe plight of honest Senator Kefauver is not unique. Wherever possible,\r\nthe underworld uses such characters to do their dirty work. They fall\r\nfor it, probably because dreamers and social planners are gullible,\r\nnot practical like their more conservative brethren. That’s why\r\npolitical bosses frequently back them and surprise semi-suspicious\r\nsuckers who think they know things.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when the late Boss Kelly of Chicago, one of the most\r\nruthless thieves who ever lived, thought he saw the handwriting on the\r\nwall, he nominated good men to run for Governor and Senator. At no time\r\nafter Adlai Stevenson went to Springfield and Professor Paul Douglas\r\ngot to Washington did these Utopians ever open their mouths or do\r\nanything, or even complain about the iniquities in Chicago, though we\r\ntold plenty and a lot of other dirt wasn’t confidential.\r\n\r\nHe hand-picked as his successor Martin Kennelly, a mild old bachelor\r\nwho didn’t know when it was Wednesday. This was a “businessmen’s\r\ncandidate.” The mob and their Democratic sidekicks gave him the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nKefauver even has a soft spot for accused Commies. He was one of the\r\nseven Senators to vote against the McCarran Bill, which Marcantonio\r\nopposed in the House. Douglas, who didn’t have guts enough to vote no,\r\nbecause that would have imperiled Lucas’ chance in Illinois, did hop in\r\nto uphold the President’s veto.\r\n\r\nThe only Senator running for reelection who opposed the McCarran Bill\r\nall the way was Lehman, a ticket-mate of mob-backed Pecora and Lynch,\r\nan old codger of eminent respectability and Wall Street millions, who\r\nis and always was “safe”--he’s too wrapped up in Park Avenue dignity\r\nand too flattered by public honors to see or understand that with\r\nhis silk-gloved hands he pulls hot chestnuts out of the oven for the\r\ndirtiest crooks, traitors and political plotters in the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27. LUCKY NUMBERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing a Congressional investigating committee gets, the sine\r\nqua non, is an appropriation. The next is a sheaf of time-tables. Then\r\ncomes the joyful junketing-time to remote places--remote from the\r\ncapital and remote from the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Kefauver committee made the grand tour--California and Florida,\r\nChicago and New York, about everything but Yellowstone Park. Its golden\r\nfleece was gambling. They could have cleaned up their quest for about\r\n$1.60 on a taxi meter.\r\n\r\nAll the evidence, all the interstate involvements and local conditions\r\nwhich are the particular province of Congress, they could find in\r\nWashington. We did. All gambling in the capital is interstate because\r\nit is inseparable from its lines into and out of Maryland and Virginia.\r\n\r\nWe outlined the setup of the nationwide underworld Syndicate. We\r\nbrought it to the District line. At that point the on-the-spot gamblers\r\ntake over.\r\n\r\nThey have been mentioned as Emmitt Warring, king of Georgetown; Attilio\r\nAcalotti, “mayor” of Dupont Circle; Sam Beard and his partner Gary\r\nQuinn, and the Sussman brothers. Of money gouged from suckers, 90 per\r\ncent clears through them, and “Black Jack” Kelleher, Frank Erickson’s\r\nlocal observer.\r\n\r\nA curious situation here is that “policy” or “numbers” gets a bigger\r\nplay than bookmaking. The reverse is true almost everywhere else. The\r\nreason ascribed by the cognoscenti is that while everyone earns a\r\nfairly good living, few have enough surplus cash for important horse\r\nbetting. But numbers tickets can be bought for from one cent up. That\r\ngame is far more profitable for the operators, too. Bookmakers can’t do\r\nmuch better than putting a ceiling on track odds. They must follow the\r\nmutuels, though they stop at a 20-to-1 payoff. Bookies who can’t lay\r\noff enough often lose on a day.\r\n\r\nThe winning numbers pay only 600 to 1, whereas 999 numbers are drawn,\r\nand the draw can be fixed.\r\n\r\nIn most towns, the numbers play is predominantly by Negroes. In\r\nWashington it is general, with white government employes in the\r\nmajority. The policy slips are usually sold by colored runners, often\r\nmessengers and elevator boys in government buildings. The salesman\r\nwithholds 25 per cent of the gross. Average booking is $50 a day.\r\n\r\nThe take from the numbers, in pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters, is\r\ndeposited in the branch of the Hamilton Bank at 20th and Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue, in the Foggy Bottom section. The Congressional committee\r\ninvestigating local crime ascertained that this bank did not report the\r\nlarge deposits of small coins. The deposits are withdrawn each day and\r\ntransferred to Maryland, where local representatives of the Syndicate\r\ndivide the receipts and send its cut to the Mafia in New York.\r\n\r\nThe sale of numbers is so widespread, the police can make only token\r\narrests. Invariably, when the peddler, usually a Negro, is locked up, a\r\nrepresentative of a bonding outfit appears at once and posts bail. Next\r\nday a member of the Charlie Ford law firm appears in court. Several\r\ndefendants testified the lawyers paid their fines. The operation will\r\nbe described in detail later.\r\n\r\nNumbers sellers are picked up all over the town, and they are not coy.\r\nFor instance, police got a squeal that two men were selling policy\r\nslips from an auto parked in the 1200 block of 7th Street, NW. Cops\r\nquestioned them and numbers slips “just rolled out of a paper bag on\r\nthe car floor.” The prisoners were very “surprised,” the more so when\r\n200 numbers books were found in the car’s trunk.\r\n\r\nVice squad dicks stopped in to get a shine at 209 K Street NW. They saw\r\nnumbers lying on a chair next to two men. When they searched them they\r\nfound many more in their possession.\r\n\r\nPolicy is a lottery. Under federal law, that is a felony. But the only\r\nway to cut in on the racket is to get tough. Twenty-five-dollar fines,\r\npaid by lawyers reimbursed by the bosses, are no deterrent. But Judge\r\nThomas D. Quinn handcuffed the police even on that. He served notice\r\non the U. S. Attorney’s office that he “will not tolerate” prosecutors\r\ndelaying court action on gambling cases until they can get grand jury\r\nindictments.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the government\r\nis within its rights requesting these continuances, but Curtis P.\r\nMitchell, an attorney for some arrested as gamblers, alleged the civil\r\nrights of numbers suspects were being disregarded.\r\n\r\nJudge Edward M. Curran spiked the government’s case when it attempted\r\nto clean up gambling in Thomas Circle. Though one defendant pleaded\r\nguilty to operation of a lottery, Judge Curran ruled police did not\r\nhave enough “probable cause” to arrest the others, who were admittedly\r\nin possession of numbers slips.\r\n\r\nWashington judges openly acknowledge the fact that the fines they\r\nimpose are paid by the bosses.\r\n\r\nJudge Henry A. Schweinhaut, of the United States District Court,\r\nfrivolously presented a numbers operator named “Lemon” a chance to\r\nprove there is honor in Washington’s gaming fraternity.\r\n\r\nHe asked him to come forward and provide the $300 fine for an aged\r\nNegro who was convicted before him of taking numbers bets.\r\n\r\n“Lemon put up bond for the defendant. Maybe Lemon will pay the fine,”\r\nsaid the District Solomon. “I’ll give him a chance to prove his loyalty\r\nto an old employe.”\r\n\r\nDefense Attorney Mitchell, who has figured in these pages before,\r\nquickly disillusioned His Honor. “As a practical matter, a numbers\r\nbacker wouldn’t be apt to pay a $300 fine for a man who only had a\r\nthree-dollar-a-day numbers book,” he explained.\r\n\r\nBut the judge winked and said, “If Lemon doesn’t pay, it might get\r\naround that he will let one of his men stay in jail. It might reduce\r\nhis prestige in the fraternity.”\r\n\r\nDid we hear someone talking about legalized and licensed gambling? This\r\nis it, with a bow from the U. S. District Court.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the top rulers of the netherworld have disassociated\r\nthemselves as much as possible from street-level vice and crime,\r\npreferring to remain on the sidelines, where their take comes in clean.\r\n\r\nThe situation in Washington is a pattern and example for the rest of\r\nthe country, because, for obvious reasons, the tygoons have preferred\r\nto have no direct dealings with law-breaking in the nation’s capital.\r\n\r\nThe method whereby the take from policy, Washington’s chief form\r\nof gambling, goes upstairs is unique and ingenious, the product of\r\nbrilliant legal scheming.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, each local numbers bank is, for the records, completely\r\nindependent. Its operator, who employs the runners who actually sell\r\nthe lottery tickets, is supposed to be completely unaffiliated, and\r\nit would take a smarter guy than any government lawyer to prove him\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, most of the local banks were really unaffiliated.\r\nSince then, on occasion, some have tried to remain that way. This is\r\nwhat happens when they do: The Big Mob sends in “customers” to bet a\r\ncertain number; then, through its ability to control the daily winning\r\nnumber, that number comes up and the banker goes broke.\r\n\r\nBut if he wants to play ball, they sell him an “insurance policy” which\r\nguarantees him from undue loss--which is prevented by the control of\r\nthe winning number. His daily premium is the payoff money.\r\n\r\nThe funniest one happened when a policy salesman asked police to lock\r\nhim up because one of his clients had a $60 hit which the runner\r\ncouldn’t pay off--having lost the money playing the numbers. It came\r\nabout when a cop admonished Lawrence Fields, obviously drunk, to quiet\r\ndown. Fields begged to be arrested on the numbers charge. The cop asked\r\nFields whether he realized the seriousness of what he was saying.\r\nFields replied, “Nothing will happen. My boss pays protection.”\r\n\r\nThe boss was identified in court as Sam Beard. Beard claims he is in\r\nthe pickle business, but he once served 53 months in jail for gambling\r\nand 13 months for tax evasion. Fields got 90 days. His client is\r\nwaiting outside the District jail.\r\n\r\nBut don’t think bookmaking is a peanut industry either. Local\r\nauthorities estimate the take of bookmakers within the District at\r\n$100,000,000 a year--not gross business, but net profits.\r\n\r\nHorse money goes to Prince Georges, Maryland, as already described.\r\nSnags Lewis, the wire service representative, transmits the payoff and\r\nprofits to New York and New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThough Bernice Franklin, former sweetheart of Attilio Acalotti,\r\ntestified in federal court that at least three members of the\r\nMetropolitan Police were paid off by gamblers in her presence,\r\nWashington authorities never show any enthusiasm toward investigating\r\ncharges of corruption against cops.\r\n\r\nWhen District Commissioner John Russell Young testified recently before\r\na special grand jury probing Washington gambling, he was not asked\r\nabout the possibility of bribes being paid by the gamblers. Assistant\r\nU. S. Attorney John W. Fihelly, conducting the inquiry, left it flat\r\nand started on “several weeks vacation.”\r\n\r\nYou can freely make a bet on a horse in almost any place in Washington\r\nexcept a church--with elevator boys in government buildings, at corner\r\ncigar and drug stores, lunch stands and bellboys. If you still can’t\r\nfind a place, the ingenuity of the Washington bookmaker will solve your\r\nproblem. For instance, the police said they broke the biggest gambling\r\nbrokerage ever operated in Washington with the arrest of two men in a\r\n“doctor’s office,” on California Avenue, N.W. Police said one of the\r\nmen they arrested was a physician. He told them he could make more\r\nmoney with betting slips than with prescriptions.\r\n\r\n“There wasn’t even a band-aid in the place.” But there were the\r\nfollowing items:\r\n\r\nBetting slips; a looseleaf notebook which appeared to be a gambling\r\nbroker’s record, containing $75,000 in IOU’s from all over the country;\r\ntwo promissory notes totaling $35,000; $134 in cash, an expensive\r\nradio, and a clock with a sweep second-hand. While police went through\r\nthe place the phone rang. A voice on the other end “started to give me\r\nhell for a bum steer, saying the odds had dropped to 8 to 5,” Sergt.\r\nJames Roche said.\r\n\r\nPolice Lt. David McCutcheon told the District license board that a\r\ngambler paid the proprietors of Filo’s restaurant, 1700-A 9th Street,\r\nNW, $200 a month for the concession to take bets there. At this writing\r\nFilo’s is still in business.\r\n\r\nDuring the seasons, Washington gamblers make book on baseball,\r\nfootball, basketball and hockey. Walter Lephfew and Skylar Wilson\r\nwere arrested this year in what is described as a $2,000,000 football\r\nlottery.\r\n\r\nWe placed bets with bookies who hang out in the G & W Lunch Room, 17th\r\nand L.\r\n\r\nMuch of the local gambling is controlled by Greeks who operate in\r\nrestaurants and private clubs.\r\n\r\nWe saw gambling going on openly on the second floor of a building on\r\nthe northwest corner of 9th and H; also in the Greek restaurant on the\r\nsecond floor of 9th and G.\r\n\r\nA dice and horse room was being operated over the Bazaar restaurant, at\r\n17th and L. Say that Steve Akaris sent you. That’s how we got in.\r\n\r\nYou can find roulette in a place at 5th and G., also over a restaurant\r\nin the 100 block of Vermont Avenue.\r\n\r\nDon’t think gambling doesn’t account for plenty of violence in the\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nOn recommendation of the District license board, the commissioners\r\nturned down a police request that they revoke a billiard hall license\r\nof William G. Heflin. Earlier in the year, Joseph H. “Big Joe” Scheve,\r\na convicted gambler, was fatally shot there. Before that, James T.\r\nSkeens shot Edward Ryan in the leg there. Police charged the billiard\r\nhall was frequented by criminals. We saw bookmakers taking bets there.\r\n\r\nA 25-year-old fireman with twenty pairs of crooked dice in his pocket\r\nwas found stabbed to death in an alley as an aftermath of a crap\r\ngame in which 15 persons participated. Every die was without 1, 3 and\r\n5, making it impossible to toss a 7. The dice were of all sizes and\r\ncolors, “suitable for almost any occasion.”\r\n\r\nOne-armed bandits are banned by District and by the new Federal law.\r\nHowever, $100 federal stamps have been purchased for 50 such machines,\r\noperating at this writing in the city of Washington. Those in officers’\r\nservice clubs have since been removed, but many operated brazenly in\r\nplaces open to the public.\r\n\r\nPinball machines, illegal in most big cities, especially in New York,\r\nand not permitted in the Virginia counties across the Potomac, are a\r\npopular indoor sport in Washington. They are found in restaurants,\r\ndrugstores, bottle clubs and playlands. Many are used as gambling\r\ndevices. The federal tax of $10 on each has been paid for 1263.\r\n\r\nFederal records show 15,000 one-armed bandits and gambling devices\r\nregistered for Maryland, of which 5,000 are in the District suburbs.\r\n\r\nMost slot machines are manufactured in Chicago. Those destined\r\nfor areas in D.C. or nearby, where they are against the law, were\r\nshipped to wholesalers in Danville, Va., then distributed sub rosa to\r\nWashington and Baltimore.\r\n\r\nPayoffs are pretty lousy.\r\n\r\nThe new Federal slot machine law is a laugh. It was dreamed up in an\r\neffort to stave off Kefauver’s investigation.\r\n\r\nThe only Senator who really fought it came from Nevada, where the\r\none-armed bandits are legal, and into which, under the new Federal law,\r\nthey can be imported freely. Nevada had nothing to lose and everything\r\nto gain.\r\n\r\nThe same Senator fought contempt citations against recalcitrant\r\nKefauver witnesses, proving, to Estes’ surprise, what we had told him\r\nabout Democratic-underworld alliances.\r\n\r\nThe joker in any statute forbidding the interstate transportation\r\nof slot machines is they are manufactured from standard and\r\ninterchangeable parts which can be assembled anywhere by any competent\r\nmechanic. Instead of shipping the finished device, the Costello\r\ninterests will merely send the parts to local distributors who will put\r\nthem together--and save freight costs.\r\n\r\nThe underworld’s Washington representatives actually lobbied for the\r\npassage of the bill, figuring that its adoption would look like a\r\nsolid accomplishment to the public, and take the “heat” off other\r\nmonkey business.\r\n\r\nAttorney General McGrath and the New Deal liberals who plugged for the\r\nmeasure had another reason. They hoped it would put the F.B.I. on the\r\nspot. Its enforcement being impossible, Hoover and his G-men would take\r\nthe blame--either that or the F.B.I. would have to hire thousands of\r\nfly-cops and become a new, super Prohibition unit, exposed to wholesale\r\ngraft and bribery, which would please the Reds and the crooks.\r\n\r\nWe don’t think gambling will ever be eliminated. We don’t think the\r\npublic wants it to be. It is a human appetite, like sex and liquor, and\r\nno sumptuary legislation can wipe it out. But gambling corrupts law\r\nenforcement officers. While wagering is illegal and undercover, this is\r\ninevitable. When cops take bribes from bookmakers they feel they do no\r\nessential harm. But it’s a start and soon they will sell out to anyone.\r\n\r\nAs to the cure, no two agree. Even your authors have divided opinions.\r\nOne believes in legalizing gambling, the other points out Nevada, where\r\nit is legal, as the horrible example. There the same mobsters control\r\nit and law enforcement officers are bought up as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28. IT’S A CRIME\r\n\r\n\r\nNo thanks is due United States Attorney George Morris Fay for the fact\r\nthat figures and information regarding the local wave of crime are\r\nstill available.\r\n\r\nShortly after he took office, in 1946, Fay rewrote the Constitution\r\nand closed off the court files from inspection by the press on felony\r\ncases. Not satisfied, last year he tightened up in Municipal Court,\r\nintroducing a form of censorship for newsmen trying to check facts.\r\n\r\nBut we finagled some figures:\r\n\r\nPer capita computations show Washington recorded one murder for every\r\n25,555 persons in 1949. But Chicago, generally conceded the gunmen’s\r\nplayground, had one murder for every 26,902. Washington jumped to one\r\nfor every 11,000 in 1950.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of population, Washington led 16 cities of 500,000 or\r\nmore in aggravated (felonious) assaults during the first six months of\r\n1950; and it was second only to Chicago in the _total_ number of such\r\ncases. Washington had 1,911, exceeded only by Chicago’s 2,184, and\r\nChicago is five times as large as Washington!\r\n\r\nThough crime in Washington decreased slightly in 1950, as compared to\r\n1949, the District is high among the leaders, per capita and in total\r\nnumber of offenses, in every major classification.\r\n\r\nCrime has always been a popular pastime here. It increased so\r\nalarmingly during the first years of the New Deal that a group of\r\npublic-spirited citizens formed the Washington Criminal Justice\r\nAssociation in 1936 to help combat it.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General in that year called Washington “the crime capital\r\nof the world.” The backers hoped for a virile, hard-hitting body,\r\nsimilar to the Chicago Crime Commission, which under Virgil Peterson,\r\nits executive director, has done so much to spotlight the workings of\r\nthe underworld there, or like Danny Sullivan’s Greater Miami Commission.\r\n\r\nThe original organizers of the Washington association included a number\r\nof do-gooders, such as Eugene Meyer, who bars the identification of\r\nNegroes in his paper. The body soon found itself struggling without\r\nsufficient funds. It is now supported by the United Community Services,\r\nwhich allots it only enough to pay for a director, an assistant and\r\na secretary. The able director, Edward J. Flynn, is a competent,\r\nimaginative individual, handcuffed by lack of funds and public\r\ndisinterest. He can do little more than keep a record of crimes as they\r\noccur, compile statistics and offer recommendations. They are good, but\r\nno one wants them.\r\n\r\nThe situation has gotten worse rather than better since the Attorney\r\nGeneral castigated the city. In 1936 there were only about 7,000\r\nserious crimes. The number dropped to about 4,000 in 1944. But by last\r\nyear it had skyrocketed to 13,000. It is now slightly lower.\r\n\r\nWashington is still the crime capital.\r\n\r\nIn other chapters we touch briefly on the so-called “organized”\r\ncrimes--prostitution, gambling, and narcotics. This chapter deals\r\nmainly with offenses of violence and those against property, which are\r\nusually regarded as unorganized.\r\n\r\nBut director Flynn agrees with your authors that, with the exception\r\nof private crimes of passion, occasional robberies by hungry men and\r\njuvenile delinquency, all crime is now organized to a degree. Flynn\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Highly organized criminal groups, carrying out skillfully planned\r\noperations, exist in Washington.”\r\n\r\nThe police disagree with him, naturally. But the record is clear for\r\nany observer who follows the entire procedure through, from commission\r\nto arrest, bail-bonding and arraignment. The combine appears in the\r\nfencing of the loot. Burglars in Washington have a union to which they\r\ncontribute a percentage of their take in return for bail when arrested,\r\nlegal representation and fixes where possible. No professional burglars\r\noperate until they make arrangements in advance for disposition of\r\ntheir stolen goods, and, thereafter, the other services. Non-members of\r\nthe union cannot secure bail at any price and are denied the services\r\nof the top criminal lawyers.\r\n\r\nWhy has the nation’s capital more crime than other cities? Flynn says\r\nit is indicative of community lethargy. He thinks that is not unique in\r\nthe District, but is equally true in every city. If that is so, there\r\nmust be a special reason why Washington is more lawless.\r\n\r\nOthers blame it on the lack of home rule and local government. Yet\r\nevery investigation and survey elsewhere shows that corrupt municipal\r\ncity hall gangs are the protectors of vice and crime. The high rates\r\nin Washington cannot be blamed on the foreign-born, because only six\r\npercent of the population is non-native. As we showed earlier, Negroes\r\ncommit most of the crime. But there are Negro criminals in other large\r\ncities, especially in New York and Chicago, where they do likewise. Why\r\nthen are Washington’s Negroes even more felonious?\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Washington is a cesspool of iniquity and a\r\nUtopia for criminals. The setup of the local government and the calibre\r\nof the men who enforce its laws and sit on its benches are partly\r\nresponsible. Archaic and often ridiculous laws and regulations are a\r\ncontributing factor.\r\n\r\nFor instance, guns are easy to buy in second-hand stores. There is no\r\nlaw requiring a license to keep a gun in a home. That forbidding the\r\ncarrying of one in a car is a dead letter. It is a felony to carry a\r\nconcealed weapon on the person without a license, but there are few\r\narrests and fewer convictions for this, because the District courts and\r\nprosecutor feel it is no offense to carry an unloaded weapon, even if a\r\nclip of cartridges is in the same pocket. An expert could load the gun\r\nwithout removing it from his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe fantastic interpretation of laws by the U. S. Attorney and the\r\nfederal courts has handcuffed the cops in their efforts to clean the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nNot long ago a Negro was arrested for kicking and assaulting another\r\nman in a bus station. Though police found an unlicensed pistol on the\r\nprisoner’s person, and bullets in another pocket, the U. S. Attorney\r\nrefused to prosecute for either the assault or concealed weapon. When\r\nqueried, a representative of his office said it was obvious the colored\r\nman was a nice guy, because he didn’t load his gun and shoot his\r\nvictim, who lay helpless on the floor. The prisoner had a record. When\r\nasked at a later date whether, in view of all the circumstances since\r\ndeveloped, the D.A.’s office would prosecute, the spokesman said, “No.\r\nNo judge will convict a colored man here for a minor offense like that.”\r\n\r\nThe federal judges are lenient because they are federal judges. Of\r\nthe 308 with life appointments throughout the United States, 224\r\nare Democrats. During the first 17 years of the Roosevelt-Truman\r\nadministrations, 289 judges were given such appointments, of whom\r\n272 were Democrats. The same ratio shows up in the District of\r\nColumbia. The Democratic judges are the choices and flunkies of\r\ncorrupt city machines or of unions, left-wingers and fellow-travelers’\r\norganizations. The city bosses’ men are lenient to law-breakers because\r\ntheir masters order them to be so. The radicals’ nominees seldom throw\r\nthe book at a defendant, because Commies, pinkos and phony progressives\r\nhate cops, refer to them as cossacks.\r\n\r\nA captain of the Metropolitan Police told us that even honest\r\nWashington coppers seldom make arrests any more, because they know\r\nwhat will happen when they get in court. The judge will harass,\r\nbullyrag and humiliate them. It is not unusual for a District jurist to\r\ncastigate the policemen, call them liars and framers, then discharge\r\nthe prisoners without hearing defense evidence. When the defendant is a\r\nNegro, the cops know they are going to get a going-over from the bench.\r\n\r\nIn 1937, after four years of Democratic administration, 90 percent\r\nof all major crimes went unpunished. Since then, largely through\r\nthe efforts of Flynn’s Washington Criminal Justice Association, and\r\nmore recently of counsel Fischbach’s revelations, about which more\r\nlater, judges have been afraid to be too raw, and are giving stiffer\r\nsentences and holding prisoners in higher bail.\r\n\r\nHowever, out of 811 of those indicted for major offenses in the last\r\nreport period who did not enter pleas of guilty, only 281, about one\r\nthird, were found guilty. Of those found guilty, the largest number\r\nreceived light sentences, far less than the maximum authorized by\r\nlaw. Even among those who pleaded guilty, more than 20 percent were\r\npermitted to assume lesser offenses.\r\n\r\nAn example of the penalties meted out for serious offenses is seen in\r\nthose convicted of first- and second-degree murder: of 22, only three\r\ngot sentences of 15 years to life; one drew 80 months to 20 years; all\r\nthe 18 others got less than 20 years, with terms tapering down to one\r\nof three-to-nine on a first-degree murder, and one of one-to-four on a\r\nsecond-degree murder. None got the chair.\r\n\r\nDisposition records on cleaning up major crimes are made to look good\r\nthrough an ingenious invention known as “Willie Pye” arrests. Whenever\r\nanyone is pinched in Washington and decides to take a plea, the cops\r\ninduce him to admit every other unsolved crime of the same nature which\r\nis still open on the books. If the accused agrees to take the rap for\r\nthese unsolved felonies, thus getting the police off the hook, they do\r\nnot present further evidence to the grand jury, and the felon is not\r\ntried for the other offenses. Thus many complaints are charged off and\r\npolice take official credit for solving crimes where no solution has\r\neventuated.\r\n\r\nThe practice grew to such an extent about a decade ago that a public\r\nstench arose. After a conference between law enforcement officials and\r\nprosecutors, it was agreed to end it. But it goes right on and the\r\nevidence of it appears every year in tabulations of “cleared by other\r\nmeans.” There were 667 so disposed of in 1949.\r\n\r\nIt is believed the term “Willie Pye arrest” first came into police\r\nparlance in Washington when a man so named lived there, about 50 years\r\nago. His business was crime. Willie was indicted on two housebreakings\r\nand confessed to many more, which were then written off as closed.\r\n\r\nAn unnamed desk sergeant immortalized Willie by using his name for the\r\npractice of shutting numerous open cases by getting multiple pleas and\r\nchoosing to proceed on only the last.\r\n\r\nThe blowup came when Leroy Mason, who was doing a stretch in Occuquan\r\nWork House for three robberies, was still being charged for crimes\r\ngoing on on the outside. A nameless Washington newspaperman composed a\r\ndeathless ditty, as offensive to grammar as the sentiment is to decency:\r\n\r\n    _Willie Pye was a regular guy,\r\n    He took the rap for you and I._\r\n\r\nThough the F.B.I. reported a six percent drop of crime in Washington\r\nthis year, the local jail population reached a new high. The courts\r\nsent 21,062 to District jail in 1950, an all-time record. Meanwhile,\r\nthe police had closed less than 60 percent of all cases involving\r\nserious felony, which by the way, was an improvement.\r\n\r\nArrests for the more serious crimes by race were as follows:\r\n\r\n      _Offense_               _Total_    _White_    _Colored_\r\n  Arson                           34         13          21\r\n  Aggravated Assault            2956        342        2614\r\n  Embezzlement and Fraud         201        146          55\r\n  Forgery and Counterfeiting     100         72          28\r\n  Grand Larceny                 1099        326         773\r\n  Housebreaking                 2878        634        2244\r\n  Homicides                       55         10          45\r\n  Incest                           5          1           4\r\n  Rape and Carnal Knowledge      191         39         152\r\n  Receiving Stolen Property       59         31          28\r\n  Robbery                       1033        230         803\r\n                                ----       ----        ----\r\n    TOTAL                       8611       1844        6767\r\n\r\nThe high incidence of Negro and juvenile crime was dealt with in detail\r\nin previous chapters. One reason there are so many colored law-breakers\r\nin Washington is that many judges in nearby Southern communities order\r\nNegro defendants to get out of town, instead of holding them for trial,\r\nand these gravitate to Washington.\r\n\r\nTough guys of both races hang around on the streets and insult\r\npassers-by with impunity, snatch purses, stick up pedestrians and mug\r\nand yoke.\r\n\r\nMost crimes in Washington are committed from Friday through Sunday.\r\nAlmost everyone has a two-day weekend, and the drinking and celebrating\r\nbegins Friday night.\r\n\r\nThe First, Second, Third and Thirteenth Police precincts account for 57\r\npercent of all serious crimes. The First is “downtown,” with tourists,\r\ntransients and night life. The others are predominantly Negro.\r\n\r\nAmong the more profitable of the organized crimes are these:\r\n\r\nHousebreaking, comparatively easy because of the large number of\r\nprivate homes and two- and three-story detached apartment buildings.\r\nThe stolen goods are fenced in East Baltimore Street, Baltimore.\r\n\r\nAuto thefts, growing more serious.\r\n\r\nBank robberies, not uncommon.\r\n\r\nPickpockets and cold-finger men find easy loot at the countless\r\ncocktail parties and other functions constantly given by lobbyists,\r\nconventioneers and diplomats. It is a cinch to crash these.\r\nJewel-thieves have rich pastures. Social climbers and ambassadors’\r\nwomen are loaded with rocks and constantly display them. A big gem haul\r\nis sent to Holland for recutting, via reverse channels used by the\r\nMafia to smuggle dope. The reset ice is smuggled back.\r\n\r\nBecause of the ease with which fixes are maneuvered, the lenient\r\nsentences, the failure of local courts to extra-penalize repeaters,\r\nWashington is indeed a picnic-pasture for crooks from all over the\r\ncountry. When other places get too hot to hold them, they hop a rattler\r\nfor the capital.\r\n\r\nThe pickings are easy. The payoff is high. The risks are minimal. The\r\nburg is a pushover.\r\n\r\nSex is a crime, too; a statutory felony. The incidence of such offenses\r\nin the Nation’s capital is so great as to be startling. The nature of\r\nthem nauseated even a couple of hardboiled reporters like us.\r\n\r\nThe figures are public property, compiled by the F.B.I., the local cops\r\nand the Davis committee. Howard Whitman, who has been doing a series\r\nof articles based largely on newspaper morgue material, printed the\r\ncomputations in _Collier’s_, later put them into a book on prurient\r\nmisdemeanors.\r\n\r\nWhitman slanted his findings to _Collier’s_ special-pleading formula\r\nand found that “crime is a slum-connected characteristic.”\r\n\r\nThat is a laugh. Washington is freer of depressed living areas than any\r\ncity in the country.\r\n\r\n“And Negroes are ghettoized in these slums,” adds Whitman gratuitously.\r\n\r\nWhitman quotes with approval the Committee for Racial Democracy\r\nwhich urged that “training in minority group problems be instituted\r\nimmediately as a part of the regular in-service training of all\r\npolicemen,” the non-sequitur supposition being that the colored folk\r\nout-rape, out-maim, out-steal and out-mugg whites eight to one because\r\nthe coppers haven’t been trained in minority group relations.\r\n\r\nNor are sex-criminals, white or colored, permanently taken off the\r\nstreets after once being caught. Washington is a recidivists’ paradise\r\nbecause of its ridiculous so-called “collateral rule” which takes the\r\nplace of posting a bond.\r\n\r\nA defendant could, and still can, despite a promise of the courts to\r\ntighten up, post a $25 collateral instead of a bond with a police\r\ncaptain. Thereupon if he does not appear in a court he is automatically\r\nfound guilty and the collateral is forfeited as a fine. And that closes\r\nthe case instead of the judge issuing a bench warrant as in other\r\njurisdictions.\r\n\r\nIn the case of violent sex cases, the maximum collateral is $500\r\nforfeit in the same way. A new judicial rule says all aggravated sex\r\ncases must be taken to court, but they are not.\r\n\r\nAbortions are cheap and easy to obtain. Police are able to arrest\r\nonly a few of the operators, and then only when complications arise.\r\nEven then, few are convicted. This racket is highly protected by an\r\ninterstate ring allied with the Mafia. A ten million a year branch was\r\nuncovered in San Francisco, built around a prominent female Chinese\r\nphysician, not publicly involved because of her high political and\r\nsocial connections. She is a close friend of Virginia Hill, gal friend\r\nof the late Bugsy Siegel.\r\n\r\nCuriously, Washington is the nation-wide headquarters for the mail\r\norder sale of dirty pictures and post cards. Why this should be so is\r\npuzzling, though those who operate the business here face no tougher\r\npenalty than elsewhere because it is a Federal offense anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29. THE LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nWe mean the poor underpaid bulls, who enforce it--or, anyway, are\r\nsupposed to.\r\n\r\nLast year the Attorney General of the United States held a conference\r\nof mayors and other local law enforcement officers to try to figure out\r\nthe causes of crime. When it was over, we button-holed a mayor of a\r\nWestern city and asked him the following question:\r\n\r\n“How come no one mentioned that hardly a crime or a vice violation is\r\npossible without the connivance of or the knowledge of local officials?”\r\n\r\nThe mayor replied, “That’s an easy one to answer. We are all local\r\nofficials.”\r\n\r\nWe do not charge that the really terrible conditions in Washington\r\nare the fault of the Metropolitan Police. Most of the cops on that\r\noverworked force are honest. If given the opportunity they would love\r\nto do their duty. Most policemen all over the country are honest, too.\r\nThey are slaves of a setup with the establishment of which they had\r\nnothing to do and which they are powerless to correct. Big payoffs\r\nare not made to men in the ranks. The orders go out from up above.\r\nPatrolmen follow orders. When they see others getting, they often ask\r\nwhat’s the use of being honest themselves? Why make pinches when the\r\nprisoners are always sprung from up above?\r\n\r\nFor many years strenuous efforts have been made to sell the idea that\r\nthe federal government and everything connected with it is straight and\r\nefficient. The Metropolitan Police force is an agency of the United\r\nStates government. Only Gilbert and Sullivan could do justice to it, as\r\na comic opera. But the laughs are costly.\r\n\r\nThe boss of the force carries the complicated title of Major and\r\nSuperintendent. His name is Robert J. Barrett and he got the job\r\nbecause he was related to the former chief.\r\n\r\nA fantastic story made the front pages last year, then was hushed\r\nand forgotten. Police Captain Anthony Richitt charged under oath,\r\nbefore a Congressional investigating committee, that he had been\r\nordered by Police Inspector Jeffreys to turn in a false report on a\r\ngambling complaint. He also swore that the District crime investigating\r\nsub-committee was worrying the police chief, who, he said, was on\r\nintimate terms with gambler Emmitt Warring; and further, that Warring\r\ndelivered messages from the chief to precinct captains.\r\n\r\nSuch charges elsewhere would have popped up a seething scandal, at\r\nleast a grand jury to-do, with the probability of new brass in the\r\npolice department. It took a long time, but even in Chicago the\r\npolice commissioner, the county chairman and the millionaire chief\r\ninvestigator for the State’s Attorney quit after publication of\r\n_Chicago Confidential_.\r\n\r\nYou think anything like that happened in Washington? In this home of\r\nlaissez faire the grand jury wasn’t interested even to the extent of\r\nwhitewashing the mud.\r\n\r\nThe incident was treated as a private feud. It was officially settled\r\non the records when Richitt apologized to his boss, in a public\r\napology, six words long:\r\n\r\n“I regret the incident ever occurred.”\r\n\r\nNo explanation, no retraction, no withdrawal of the charges.\r\n\r\nBarrett’s reply was nearly as short:\r\n\r\n“Richitt has complied with the orders of the department as far as I am\r\nconcerned.”\r\n\r\nThus was departmental satisfaction restored. But there was no\r\nsatisfaction for the public. No determination was ever made as to\r\nwhether the chief had ordered his subordinate to falsify arrest\r\nrecords. It was decided by all concerned that this was of no interest\r\nto the tax-payers, the grand jury included.\r\n\r\nBarrett had forgotten he had told the press he had what he called\r\n“evidence tending to show perjury” on the subject of Captain Richitt.\r\nChairman Davis of the House District Sub-Committee, before which the\r\nstink started, got into the act and announced he, too, had closed the\r\nbook on the affair.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the deal apparently were such that neither Barrett nor\r\nRichitt are ever again to question the other’s activities. Some months\r\nbefore, evidence was brought forth that Richitt had bought seven autos\r\nin addition to the one he was driving during 27 post-war months, when\r\ncivilians could get cars only in the black market. No explanation was\r\nvolunteered by anyone, though Richitt had sold most of the cars as soon\r\nas he bought them.\r\n\r\nYour authors know this is a common practice in police departments all\r\nover the country.\r\n\r\nA sergeant of the Bridgeport, Connecticut, force was fired for similar\r\nactivities. Many cops used their emergency priorities to order cars\r\nwhich they then transferred to dealers, without ever taking possession.\r\nThe cops rarely handled the money. The dealer went with them to accept\r\ndelivery and paid the purchase price, the cops chiseling from $500 to\r\n$1,000 on each transaction.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived in Washington to dig for this book, we asked: “Who\r\nmakes the fixes?”\r\n\r\nIn other cities, contacts are closed with precinct, ward and district\r\nleaders of the political party in office. If you want to retail\r\nwomen, make book, land pickpocketing privileges or get a summons or a\r\nviolation squared, you go to see this local boss.\r\n\r\nIf money is to be passed it goes through him. Many favors are granted\r\nin return for party loyalty, votes or campaign contributions. He takes\r\ncare of those, too. The leader passes the word along to city hall,\r\nwhere it is relayed to the local police station. In some towns, Chicago\r\nfor example, the channels are short-circuited in advance, so the leader\r\ncan go direct to his police captain.\r\n\r\nBut what happens in Washington, where there are no voters, so there are\r\nno district leaders? How do you fix the cops? Who is the collector?\r\n\r\nSome naive Washingtonians said there is no such thing. There is no\r\ncollecting. There is no graft.\r\n\r\nThat is cockeyed. The payoff is through the local police captain, who\r\nacts as the collector for anyone in the District Government who is to\r\nbe fixed. The captain retains his own percentage of the boodle, plus\r\nanything he can steal, then passes the balance up above, through the\r\nregularly established channels.\r\n\r\nSuch a system plays hell with the poor cops on the street. The guy who\r\npays the captain for protection knows he doesn’t have to take care of\r\nunderlings. The most the uniformed patrolman is good for is a meal, a\r\ncigar and an occasional five-spot. Vice squad men and detectives can\r\nsometimes do a little modest shaking, but not enough to get rich on.\r\n\r\nA police captain told us this story: Two Chicago detectives came to\r\nWashington to pick up a wanted prisoner. It is the custom among all\r\npolice departments to entertain cops visiting on business. Washington\r\nhas no fund for such purposes. Its men are so poorly paid, they can’t\r\ntreat. But the two assigned to keep the visitors happy had worked the\r\nbright-light belt, so they knew where they could cuff a few small night\r\nclubs. During the evening, one Chicago detective asked the Washington\r\ncop, “What is your job worth?”\r\n\r\nThe reply was, “I get $3,300 a year?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t mean your salary; what’s it worth?”\r\n\r\nThe Washingtonian looked puzzled. The policemen from the Windy City\r\nsaid, “You can talk freely. We’re friends. No wise cop in Chicago would\r\ntake the job unless he could pick up at least $10,000 a year on the\r\nside.”\r\n\r\nWashington policemen who can average $20 a week extra consider\r\nthemselves lucky. Not so many higher officers.\r\n\r\nInternal Revenue agents, who never allow themselves to be quoted, told\r\nus some officers have safe deposit-vaults choked with big bills. But\r\nmany others are honest, like chumps. They have to go along with the\r\ncrooks to hold their jobs. They can’t squawk without implicating too\r\nmany important higher-ups.\r\n\r\nSalaries of Washington policemen range from a take-home pay of only\r\n$200 a month for the lowest-grade patrolman to about $10,000 a year\r\ngross for the chief. Military ranks are used. Private, sixth grade, the\r\nhighest non-officer rank, pays $3,750 a year. A corporal gets $4,025, a\r\nsergeant $4,228, a lieutenant $4,600, and a captain $5,300. That’s the\r\nsalary on which Captain Richitt bought eight cars in 27 months.\r\n\r\nIf the fix you’re after is of a nature which the local precinct\r\ncaptain can’t handle, you go through a certain District Commission\r\nemploye who is the bagman for one of the three District Commissioners.\r\nThe Commission is the immediate boss of the police department. Any\r\ncommissioner can issue orders to the chief.\r\n\r\nThere are occasions, however, when a really strong in is needed.\r\nWashington is federal territory and is ruled nominally by the national\r\nadministration. In such an instance, the guy who wants to call the cops\r\noff has to try other doors. The odds are, even if he is in business in\r\nWashington, he has his roots elsewhere. Many Washingtonians maintain\r\nvoting addresses in the states from which they originally came. Others\r\nhave friends, partners and relatives in various states.\r\n\r\nThe procedure is to make the connection through a Democratic county\r\ncommitteeman back home or through a member of Congress in the home\r\nstate. Congress is the ruler of the District, and almost every\r\nCongressman is as busy as a Chicago alderman fixing everything from\r\nparking tags to felony warrants.\r\n\r\nIt is similar when a cop needs influence to square a rap or get an\r\nappointment or a promotion. Elsewhere we know that being a paid-up\r\nmember of the local political club never hurt the career of a\r\npoliceman. Here there are no political clubs, and most cops are not\r\neven Washingtonians. Their jobs are not confined to locals, but are\r\nopen to all American citizens, regardless of residence. You can take a\r\ncivil service test back home in Oskaloosa, then arrive in Washington a\r\nfull-fledged policeman.\r\n\r\nMost Washingtonians don’t even want to get on the force at the\r\npenny-ante salary. But $3,000 a year looks good to a cotton-picker in\r\nMississippi, where the annual per capita income is $600. When he gets\r\nto Washington he finds the $600 back home goes further than $3,000 here.\r\n\r\nSo, what does a cop do when he needs help? He follows the procedure\r\noutlined above. If he comes from out of town he corresponds with his\r\nlocal ward-heeler or goes directly to his Congressman on Capitol Hill.\r\n\r\nWe asked one cop, “What do you do if you’re a native of Washington and\r\nhave no vote?”\r\n\r\nHe replied, “You’re just out of luck.”\r\n\r\nThat is, unless you’re a Negro.\r\n\r\nThe Washington force had some fine colored cops and detectives,\r\nnative-born men who decided to make a career of police work in the\r\ndays before Washington was flooded with the displaced from the\r\nplantations in the Deep South. In those days Negroes got no special\r\nprivileges in Washington. Now almost all of the 300 colored policemen\r\nare political appointees. The white applicant undergoes a rigid and\r\nrigorous investigation; Negroes are forced on the force even over the\r\ndisapproval of the department’s intelligence squad.\r\n\r\nMany colored policemen have rackets on the side, are gamblers, operate\r\nwhore-houses or do a little pimping.\r\n\r\nThe frequency with which the following happens is too great to set it\r\naside as a mere isolated example: White cops tell you colored ones\r\noften stop pretty white women drivers, bawl them out and threaten them\r\nwith arrests until they cry, then offer to square it for some petting.\r\n\r\nTestimony under oath, reported in a previous chapter, in which a\r\nformer sweetheart of gambler Attilio Acalotti charged she had seen\r\nhush-money slipped to three cops, was not pursued by police brass, the\r\nDistrict Attorney or the grand jury. Several defendants were convicted\r\nfor trying to influence her to change her testimony, though Acalotti,\r\n“Snags” Lewis and Frank Billeci were granted new trials on the gambling\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nOur indictment is not against Washington’s police. As we said, most of\r\nthem are honest, conscientious, decent citizens, thwarted by something\r\nabove their reach.\r\n\r\nThe culprit is the system. That is responsible for the childish,\r\nirresponsible atmosphere of everything in this dizziest of American\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nDon’t think, despite the annual yaps for more assistance, the\r\nWashington police force is radically undermanned. Compared to numbers\r\nin other cities, it is not. The Metropolitan Police have the second\r\nhighest manpower per capita of any large outfit in the country. It is\r\nnot up to authorized strength, but that goes for most cities. That\r\ndoesn’t tell the story, because, as we indicated, there are at least\r\nfive other police forces operating in the city, with several hundred\r\nmore cops on tap. Generally speaking, the jurisdiction of each force is\r\nlimited to the particular area for which it was created. All Washington\r\npolicemen have the right to make arrests for crimes committed in their\r\npresence in any part of the District. For purposes of convenience,\r\ndeals are made between various forces, so sometimes one patrols a\r\ndistrict which really belongs to another. For instance, if a small\r\nsquare or park is situated miles away from the next nearest park, the\r\ncity police often relieve the National Park Police of the necessity of\r\nsending squad-cars far off their regular beats.\r\n\r\nThere is a reverse, too. The Metropolitan force has about 1,800 men for\r\nits 14 precincts and one harbor station, but men are continually called\r\nfor and assigned to guard visiting diplomats and dignitaries, and for\r\nspecial duty at the White House, government establishments, and even as\r\nushers at tea-parties. With days off, sick leaves and men on special\r\nassignments, the force is lucky when it can put 300 cops on the streets\r\non any shift.\r\n\r\nThe police are used for many duties delegated to others in\r\nwell-regulated cities. For instance, policemen must act as collection\r\nagents for wives with delinquent husbands. Any Congressman can call and\r\nask for police protection, which means he may want a cop in front of\r\nhis house as a parking attendant for his private parties.\r\n\r\nAny time the President or an important official drives through\r\nWashington, special cops are strung along the route to clear traffic.\r\nWives of Congressmen and expectant mothers with a drag rate a police\r\nescort to a hospital. Even the circus can call for a special detail of\r\n22 men.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to keep any foot patrolmen on the streets.\r\nThe force is all-motorized, that being the only way it can get around\r\nthe sprawling District. Meanwhile, there are no harness-bulls on\r\nbeats to keep toughs and thugs in line. So serious is the shortage of\r\npersonnel that the black marias attached to each of the 14 precincts\r\nroll the streets 24 hours a day instead of being in their garages. The\r\npatrol-wagons are equipped with two-way radios and respond to calls the\r\nsame as do squad cars. This is a help for spot work, one up on most\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nOne chief trouble with the police department is that so few of its men\r\nare natives. They have no local civic pride. Another factor is the\r\nconstant turnover in personnel, because of the lousy salaries and lean\r\npickings down below. There is no adequate pension system. In New York\r\nthey can retire on a minimum of half pay after 20 years, regardless of\r\nage, which means a man who goes on the force at 21 can get off at 41\r\nwith a life pension. But in Washington you cannot apply for retirement\r\nbefore age 55, with 25 years’ service. And even then there is no\r\nguarantee you will be allowed to quit, as retirement is not automatic,\r\nbut at the pleasure of the board. Usually only one-third of those who\r\napply are permitted to quit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Washington cops work an eight-hour day on an\r\nauthorized five-day week, and are not restrained from holding jobs on\r\nthe outside which don’t conflict with their assigned duties. Many own\r\nor work in stores. Several are chauffeurs. Embassies hire them for\r\nbody-guards. Some drive cabs. A few owned fleets of them, but this was\r\nforbidden when it was found they were using their police pull to get\r\ntheir drivers off for traffic violations.\r\n\r\nOne policeman, Private John U. Carroll, managed a chile parlor in\r\nthe 700 block, 11th Street, SE. There was nothing wrong with that,\r\naccording to regulations, but the police trial board nabbed him\r\nwhen he failed to report that he had been in a fist fight with some\r\ncustomers in his place. According to testimony, Danny Petro, a former\r\nprofessional pug, walked into the “parlor” and slugged Carroll’s pal.\r\nThat brought on a four-man melee in which the cop was injured. The\r\ntrial board fined him $75. After being restored to duty he retired,\r\nclaiming a veteran’s disability.\r\n\r\nThough the department lowered standards because of the difficulty\r\nof recruiting men, its record for solving crimes is still good. But\r\nconvictions and sentences are far under the American averages. The\r\npresent laws and regulations so hamper the police that even if all were\r\nhonest and intelligent, which they aren’t, serious inroads into the\r\ncrime situation would be impossible.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious roadblocks is the fact that after they make an\r\narrest and hold a prisoner for the magistrate, they cannot make their\r\ncomplaints to the court direct, or tell the judge what it is all about.\r\nWashington rules require policemen to go to the U.S. Attorney and\r\nplead with him to book a case. The prosecutor thus sits as practically\r\na committing magistrate, as the defendant and his lawyers are heard\r\nat the same time, and they can bargain with him for a nolle pros or a\r\nlesser charge.\r\n\r\nIf the U.S. Attorney decides not to handle a case, the police are sunk.\r\nThey cannot ask the municipal judge to hold or commit. In many other\r\njurisdictions, New York for instance, the arresting officer acts for\r\nthe state at the preliminary hearing, before a magistrate, and not only\r\ntells his story to the judge, but can question the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Attorney is usually reluctant to prosecute. Even if he decides\r\nto, the cops are due for a browbeating from the judge. This story is\r\nno isolated incident--it is typical of what constantly goes on in the\r\nlocal, politically appointed courts:\r\n\r\nMany policemen told us the courts work against them. When they make\r\narrests they have to go to trial on their own time and are usually\r\nkept sitting there all day at the pleasure of the defendant and his\r\nlawyer. The defendant may wander around, but the policeman is required\r\nto remain in the court until the case is called. He is not even\r\npermitted to go to the washroom. If he does, the eagle-eyed shysters\r\ncall the case immediately, with court consent, and the defendant is\r\ndischarged--for lack of prosecution!\r\n\r\nSeveral policemen who went to the toilet were threatened with contempt\r\ncitations.\r\n\r\nFrom the time a policeman makes an arrest, until the final disposition\r\nof the case, the entire atmosphere of the District enforcement\r\nmachinery is mined against him. The District Attorney’s office is\r\nskeptical of anything he says, and is inclined to side with the\r\naccused. The courts, frequently presided over by gangster-appointed\r\njudges or left-wingers whose constituents are rebels against the\r\naccepted code, bend backward. They make defendants of the cops instead\r\nof the prisoners. So most policemen shrug and forget about it. For\r\ninstance, in the Black Belt, not one of every three known crimes is\r\nreported. The experienced cops take it easy, go to the ball games and\r\ndances.\r\n\r\nThe most absurd straitjacket in which the Washington police are\r\nconfined is the law which forbids them to serve warrants. They may be\r\nserved only by deputy U.S. marshals.\r\n\r\nThis completely screws up the orderly procedure, because District\r\njudges, who are hot hell to protect the civil rights of murderers,\r\npimps, dope-peddlers and gamblers, refuse to hold a prisoner in most\r\ncases unless he is arrested on a warrant. And they never uphold a John\r\nDoe warrant.\r\n\r\nFor instance, on one occasion, two cops assigned to the vice squad at\r\nnight, working undercover on prostitution, got into a house and nabbed\r\nseveral bottles of whiskey there. They called for a police car. When it\r\narrived, further search turned up narcotics. Twenty-six were arrested\r\nwithout a warrant. The police knew the courts would not hold them for\r\neven disorderly conduct, because arresting officers could not specify\r\nwhich offense each and every one had committed. So the prisoners\r\nwere not photographed or fingerprinted. All were allowed to post $5\r\ncollateral, which was, of course, forfeited.\r\n\r\nA cop can arrest a man whom he sees in the process of house-breaking on\r\nburglary, but if he then fans him and finds a gun he cannot charge him\r\nwith a concealed-weapon violation, because he had no warrant for the\r\nsearch. When police have information that a crime is being committed on\r\na premise, they must first get in touch with the U.S. Commissioner or a\r\njudge, then locate a deputy marshal to come and serve the warrant.\r\n\r\nBut don’t you assume you can get away with anything in Washington. The\r\ncops are death on jay-walkers. If you cross against the light you’ll\r\nbe jugged. That in Washington is more serious and more culpable than\r\nmurder!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30. HOW TO STAY OUT OF JAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the steps:\r\n\r\nFirst you break the law.\r\n\r\nThen you get pinched.\r\n\r\nThen you hire Charlie Ford.\r\n\r\nWho is he? Charles E. Ford is the “Fifth Street Cicero.”\r\n\r\nFord, a behemoth of 220 pounds, is 52. He has been practicing law in\r\nWashington for 28 years. His father, a New Jersey Democrat, was the\r\npublic printer of the United States in 1913. Since then a lot has been\r\nprinted about his son in the public records.\r\n\r\nAs noted, Ford was the late Jimmy La Fontaine’s lawyer and is a\r\ntrustee of his estate. He appeared in Chicago to convince the Kefauver\r\ncommittee it couldn’t force Anna Fischetti to testify against her\r\nhusband, Charles, the notorious Capone gangster. And he convinced it.\r\n\r\nBut not all Ford’s work is so aristocratic. He and his associates take\r\nthem as they come. Hardly a day passes without defendants in criminal\r\ncourt being aided and comforted by Ford or someone from his office.\r\n\r\nHe is the darling of the gambling and prostitution fraternity. His\r\nclients seldom go to jail. The police don’t feel so bad when they lose\r\nto Ford as they do when other lawyers oppose them. For Ford is a great\r\nfriend of the cops. Whenever a policeman gets in trouble, Ford takes\r\nhis case, usually without fee.\r\n\r\nCharlie is one of those big, brash, bluff guys everyone loves,\r\nespecially the newspapermen. He feeds them plenty of copy--and\r\nliquor--and never hesitates to give them a lift when they need\r\nbackground material on gangsters and criminals, without violating his\r\nfiduciary ethics. He is a social guy who likes to entertain and who\r\nloves to eat. One of his clients was the late Tom O’Donnell, and under\r\nthe terms of his will Charlie operates the two celebrated O’Donnell\r\nrestaurants and patronizes them freely.\r\n\r\nWhenever his waist gets out of bounds, he goes to Hot Springs,\r\nArkansas, for the reducing baths and a few days of friendship and\r\ncheer with Owney “The Killer” Madden, retired gang chieftain, now Hot\r\nSprings’ most eminent elder statesman.\r\n\r\nNone of Charlie’s clients has ever gone to the electric chair.\r\nOne was sentenced to death for murder, but saved Charlie’s record\r\nby considerately hanging himself in jail. So he is one up on Sam\r\nLeibowitz, whose lone mistake waited for the ministrations of the\r\npublic executioner. But Ford is that kind of a guy. Everyone loves him.\r\nNo one would embarrass him.\r\n\r\nWe have sworn testimony before us which shows the operations of Ford’s\r\njail-thwarting apparatus. It usually works this way: The prisoner, who\r\nmay be a numbers peddler, a bookmaker’s runner, or a street-walker,\r\nis booked at the police station. He or she puts in a phone call to\r\na certain designated unofficial party. Thereupon one of a half-dozen\r\nbail-bond brokers gets a call, and within minutes a runner for the\r\nbondsman appears at the police station and puts up surety for the\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nAmong bailers-out utilized by the organization are James H. Conroy,\r\nIsaac P. Jones, William P. Ryan, and Leonard, Louis, Max and Meyer\r\nWeinstein.\r\n\r\nThe legal fee for a $500 bail bond in the District is $75. The\r\nforegoing bondsmen charge the combine only $37.50, half-price, for\r\nspringing a protected person. The rules regarding their surety are\r\nsketchy. They may register a $25,000 piece of property, then lay a\r\nhundred or a thousand $25,000 bonds against it.\r\n\r\nOn release, the defendant may visit the law offices of Ford, on 5th\r\nStreet, where he is interviewed by Ford or his associate, Clifford\r\nAllder since the resignation of James K. Hughes. But sometimes the\r\ndefendant does not speak to his counsel until the case is actually\r\ncalled in court, when his lawyer--Ford or an associate--whom he has\r\nnever seen before, stands up for him at arraignment. If the defendant\r\nhas no previous convictions, Ford’s office often pleads him guilty;\r\nwhereupon the judge imposes a fine of usually not more than $25. We\r\nhave proof that the fines for many of these defendants are paid on the\r\nspot from the lawyer’s pocket.\r\n\r\nThe system is keenly organized. Not one in a hundred people arrested\r\npays his own bail-bond fee or knows who contacted the bondsman or\r\npaid him. Records of the bondsmen are kept so cryptically that in the\r\nrare instances when they are queried under oath they can say all they\r\nremember is they got a call from someone who only gave his first name,\r\nto put up bail, and they have no record to show who paid them. The\r\nrules are being changed. They must obtain a full name--but not for\r\npublic record. And they won’t ask for birth certificates, either.\r\n\r\nThe Ford office has been able to pass the buck between its members.\r\nThey cannot remember who retained them, who paid the retainer, or who\r\nput up the money to pay the fines, if “they actually did it,” which\r\nthey “doubt.”\r\n\r\nFord successfully defied a Congressional committee which tried to\r\nmake him divulge the names of his clients, though he admitted Emmitt\r\nWarring was one. The others, he said, were known to the public only as\r\nrespectable businessmen. They were “more powerful” than Warring or even\r\nthe late Jimmy La Fontaine, who were only peanut-peddlers compared to\r\nthem, he said.\r\n\r\nWhen pressed, Ford remembered a man by the name of Bettis whom he\r\nrepresented; and Earl MacDonald and Attilio Acalotti. He said he\r\nthought he had represented another defendant, named “Washington--I\r\nthink it was George Washington, and that’s all I can remember now.”\r\n\r\nFord’s business is not confined to the gambling and hustling\r\nfraternity. You see his name bob up in court on almost every kind of\r\ncriminal case. One of his recent ones was the arrest of two men on\r\ncharges of violating the alcohol tax laws.\r\n\r\n“Did you have a warrant?” Ford thundered at the ATU agent. When he\r\nconceded he had not, Ford asked, “How did you know this is alcohol?\r\nDon’t you know it is illegal to arrest people without a warrant?”\r\n“I smelled the alcohol,” declared Agent Sweeney. “I’ve been in\r\nthis business for 17 years and I’ve developed a keen sense of\r\nsmell--especially for alcohol.”\r\n\r\nFord’s clients were accused of unloading a truck with 127 gallons of\r\nmoonshine whiskey.\r\n\r\nFord’s office has practically a monopoly on the setting up of and\r\norganizing after-hour bottle-clubs. He is generally given credit by the\r\nlocal legal fraternity for being the genius who figured out the way to\r\nsidestep the 2 o’clock closing ordinance. His associate is defending\r\nthe confessed killer in the recent Hideaway shooting; Ford himself\r\nsecured the Hideaway’s after-hours charter.\r\n\r\nFord’s operations are not confined to the District, but lap over into\r\nnearby Maryland, where, as trustee for the multi-million-dollar estate\r\nof gambler La Fontaine, he finds plenty of activity. Many of the\r\ngamblers and other shady citizens whom he represents operate across\r\nstate lines. The boundaries often come to the aid of his clients. For\r\nmany offenses, especially most of those before the District Municipal\r\nCourt, there is no method whereby authorities can extradite defendants\r\nfrom Maryland or Virginia, and vice versa. It is very much as if a\r\nlaw-breaker could take refuge in Brooklyn when wanted in Manhattan,\r\nboth boroughs of New York City. There is no more physical difference\r\nbetween Prince Georges, Maryland, and the District than that.\r\n\r\nThis all-service Ford is chairman of the Criminal Law Committee of the\r\nDistrict Bar Association.\r\n\r\nAnother lawyer who frequently appears in court for arrested hustlers is\r\nEd Buckley.\r\n\r\nFifth Street, between Indiana and D, is called “The Fifth Street\r\nLawyers’ Association,” because so many bondsmen, shysters and good\r\nlawyers have offices there.\r\n\r\nWe asked a friend to name the real sure shot mouthpiece who could\r\nspring you if you were arrested for murder and knew you were guilty.\r\n\r\nHe said William Leahy was the best trial lawyer in town and one of the\r\nmost respected. James Laughlin, who himself was once arrested but not\r\nprosecuted after a reversal, is another successful practitioner.\r\n\r\nOthers who do considerable criminal defense work are Denny Hughes, Sol\r\nLittenberg and Milton Ehrlich.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting criminal lawyer is Robert I. Miller, who shot and\r\nkilled a St. Elizabeth’s Hospital psychiatrist whom he suspected of\r\nplaying with Mrs. Miller. The shooting took place at about noon one\r\nday, in the heart of the shopping section at 11th and G Streets. He\r\nwas represented by H. Mason Welch, who sob-storied the jury into an\r\nacquittal on the “unwritten law.”\r\n\r\nMiller is not the smartest lawyer in town, but he does a tremendous\r\nbusiness defending Negroes and other superstitious criminals who engage\r\nhim sometimes just to sit at the trial table for good luck, because\r\nhe beat his own case. Miller, an ostentatious person, often wipes his\r\nglasses with a $100 bill while addressing a jury. He claimed close\r\nfriendship to Roosevelt and Garner and decorates his office with photos\r\nof them. He ran a Republicans-for-Roosevelt club.\r\n\r\nSome lawyers win their cases through merit, others through a fix. Still\r\nothers, who weren’t envied by their colleagues, had to do it the hard\r\nway when a certain former bachelor-lady judge, who shall be nameless,\r\nrendered her verdicts in favor of clients of the mouthpieces whose\r\npersuasion grew between covers not on law books. She was an awful\r\ntomato, and many attorneys preferred to lose their cases.\r\n\r\nJudge Hitz, the humorist of the local bench, got off a dilly when he\r\ndiscovered the plaintiff in a matrimonial action was still living with\r\nher husband, the whole divorce proceedings being a sham to swindle\r\ncreditors. Said the judge, in dismissing the action, “You can’t\r\nlitigate by day and fornicate by night.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31. THE BOSSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last orthodox political boss of Washington was Alexander Robey\r\nShepherd. When he finished with the city treasury, Congress voted to\r\nend home rule and took back the government.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of its incorporation as a city, in 1802, Washington was\r\nrun by elected mayors and aldermen. In 1871, in President Grant’s\r\nadministration, it was turned into a territory, similar to Alaska or\r\nHawaii, with delegates in Congress and a large measure of home rule.\r\nShepherd was a pal of General Grant, who had numerous smelly friends.\r\n\r\nShepherd’s stewardship was modern in every respect. He went in for a\r\nNew Deal on a big scale. The town was torn up while Shepherd paved\r\nstreets, installed sewers--sometimes two sets to one avenue--went\r\nin for slum clearance, built squares, parks, circles, gas-mains and\r\nsidewalks. Shepherd began life as a plumber, and showed partiality for\r\nanything with pipes.\r\n\r\nShepherd had built up a small Tammany to keep his boys in power. Votes\r\nwere bartered, crimes were fixed, laws were perverted. When the end\r\ncame, Shepherd skipped and hid out until the statute of limitations ran\r\nout. When he returned they greeted him with a brass band, like New York\r\ndid Jimmy Walker, and built him a statue.\r\n\r\nThe Congress was more interested in the welfare of the District of\r\nColumbia 75 years ago than it is now. Unable to stomach the stench, it\r\ndecided to exercise its Constitutional right to govern the District,\r\nand substituted the present commission-form of government in place of\r\nhome rule and local suffrage.\r\n\r\nUnder the present setup, the executive is a three-man commission,\r\nappointed by the President for a three-year term. One must be from the\r\nCorps of Engineers of the Army. On the law books, these commissioners\r\nhave no more power than a New York City Borough President They can\r\ndo practically nothing without approval from Congress. But by virtue\r\nof the apathy that prevails in Washington, these men have become\r\nlittle czars. Congress, by statute, has empowered the commissioners\r\nto make building and plumbing regulations and to create and enforce\r\nall reasonable police and other city rules. But they do not levy taxes\r\nor make appropriations. That is done by Congress. And that’s the\r\nDistrict’s chief squawk.\r\n\r\nEvery buck collected in Washington goes into the general funds of the\r\nU.S. Treasury; not earmarked for the District. All payments come out\r\nof the same general fund. The result is that, while Congress pays up\r\nto ten percent of the cost of local government, the citizens bear the\r\nother 90 percent. But 52 percent of all the property is tax-exempt. The\r\ngovernment owns more than 40 percent, the rest belongs to embassies,\r\ntax-free organizations like the Red Cross, etc. So the residents\r\ncomplain that the rich U.S. government is riding along on a free pass,\r\nleaving local property to bear the cost of supporting the huge Federal\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nThe present commissioners are John Russell Young, president of the\r\nBoard; Guy Mason, and Brigadier General Gordon R. Young, the engineer\r\ncommissioner. Mason’s term expired in February, 1951, but he is\r\npermitted to serve until another is appointed or he be reappointed.\r\n\r\nUnder them, the commissioners have a large staff of special assistants,\r\nprivate secretaries, administrative assistants and others who have\r\naccess to their offices. We are just telling you this in case you are\r\nthinking of making a fix, for one of these persons is the guy to see.\r\n\r\nOne of the three commissioners is noted for his ability to bollix\r\neverything up after a big, bad night--which is almost every night.\r\nEven his enemies consider inebriation a valid excuse for his befuddled\r\ncondition. A Congressman investigating the Commission said, “After all,\r\nthe poor guy always has a hangover. You can’t blame him for what he\r\ndoes when he feels awful.”\r\n\r\nUnder the commissioners are such usual municipal executive officers\r\nas assessors, auditors, tax collectors, license commissioners and\r\nbureaus of public welfare, recreation, traffic, police, fire, health,\r\ncorrections; and--oh, yes--the corporation counsel.\r\n\r\nThe observer who takes a gander at the judicial branch of the District\r\ngovernment sometimes wonders if he followed Lewis Carroll’s Alice down\r\ninto the rabbit hole.\r\n\r\nThe judicial powers are exercised by the District courts, which sit not\r\nonly for federal cases, but for felonious breaches of the local law,\r\ntoo; and by municipal courts, judges of which are appointed for six\r\nyears. They have jurisdiction over minor suits and unimportant law and\r\nordinance violations.\r\n\r\nMembers of the federal judiciary for the District of Columbia need not\r\nbe local residents. They may be appointed from anywhere in the country.\r\nUsually these plums go to deserving Democrats from elsewhere. At this\r\nwriting there are 12 District judges and 10 municipal court judges,\r\nin addition to justices of the United States Court of Appeals for the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, the Municipal Court of Appeals, and the Juvenile\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nThe District courts serve a two-fold function. They act both as federal\r\ncourts and as superior state courts, handling civil and criminal\r\nmatters. No judges of either court are elected by the local citizens or\r\nby their representatives. They have no interest in the community. They\r\ndo not partake of a legacy of local common law and custom.\r\n\r\nIf any courts should be impartial, those of the District might be. But\r\nthey are not. Some of the judges are venal, inefficient party hacks or\r\nmilitant propagandists for left-wing philosophies.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia has the most overworked\r\noffice in the land. He not only functions as a local district attorney\r\nand as United States attorney, but triples in brass with a job\r\ncorresponding to a state attorney general. But his budget and the\r\nnumber of assistants allotted him are on a per capita population basis,\r\nas though he had to prosecute only federal cases in any city the size\r\nof Washington.\r\n\r\nIn the prosecution of some minor cases in municipal court alone has\r\nhe any assistance. The city Corporation Counsel’s office handles\r\nthose. To demonstrate again what can happen when a bureaucracy turns\r\ndictator--the criminal division of his office has no law library. It\r\ndoes not have a secretary.\r\n\r\nIf he or his assistants want to check a law or a decision they have to\r\nbuy their own books. He is given no fund to keep records, so no records\r\nare kept. It is almost impossible for him to find out the disposition\r\nof cases. He has only five low-paid assistants assigned to municipal\r\ncriminal courts, and these are so overworked, sometimes they have\r\nto prosecute cases on an average of one every three minutes. Under\r\nDistrict law, defendants are permitted jury trials in all cases where\r\nthe penalty is in excess of ninety days or a $300 fine. It is no wonder\r\nthe Corporation Counsel is usually willing to take a plea of disorderly\r\nconduct, instead. The maximum penalty for that is $25, no jail.\r\n\r\nPersons accused of serious crimes under federal law must be booked\r\nimmediately before a United States Commissioner, as all crimes in the\r\nDistrict, even those like assault, robbery, drunken driving, gambling,\r\nhomicide, and rape, which elsewhere belong exclusively to the state,\r\nare federal matters here.\r\n\r\nWe gave you a rough idea of the volume of such criminal activities\r\nin the District. If those defendants had been arrested for the same\r\noffenses in states, they would be booked before a magistrate, a police\r\ncourt or a justice of the peace. There are none such in Washington\r\nother than the judges. The chief committing magistrate is the United\r\nStates Commissioner, and he has no assistants. He not only performs the\r\nfederal duties that U.S. Commissioners in other towns assume, but he\r\nalso acts as a committing magistrate on all local felony charges in the\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nA U.S. Commissioner is not a judge. He is chosen by the local Federal\r\nbench. He serves without salary on a fee basis, but is limited by\r\nstatute to a maximum of $9,400 a year, out of which he is required\r\nto pay office rent and stenographic expenses. The law permits a\r\nU.S. Commissioner to practice law on the side, and many in other\r\njurisdictions do, but, because the D.C. office is the busiest in the\r\ncountry, he has no time to handle outside cases. The Commissioner is\r\non duty 24 hours a day. There is no night court. He is it. Police\r\nawaken him at any hour of the night when they make important arrests\r\nor require warrants, and he is busy at hearings, setting bail, and\r\npresiding at arraignments all day.\r\n\r\nWhen you get into the U.S. Attorney’s office you really see how things\r\nare loused up here. The rich Federal government apparently has dough to\r\ntoss away everywhere else, but not in its own home. Of course, there\r\nare no faithful voters to be placated here. District Attorney Fay has\r\nonly 34 men on his staff; his office is required to do more work than\r\nthe entire Second Judicial Circuit, which includes the entire states of\r\nVermont, Connecticut and the four districts of New York. His budget is\r\nso limited, most of his assistants receive only about $4,000 a year,\r\nand so the turnover is terrific; young men just out of law school go\r\nto work for him for a couple of years, then go out to make a living.\r\n\r\nHis office is so understaffed, there are not enough employes around to\r\nhandle all complaints. It is possible to walk in and rifle the files\r\nat will. Many shyster lawyers often do that, killing the cases against\r\ntheir clients.\r\n\r\nWith such a small, unseasoned staff, it is no wonder the complaint\r\ndesk in the U.S. Attorney’s office has been compared to “a bargain\r\ngrocery counter.” It looks very much like one. It’s a long wooden\r\nshelf behind which a deputy district attorney stands and does business\r\nwith plaintiffs, defendants, cops and lawyers across it. We noted that\r\npolice may not enter their own complaints. They must bring them to the\r\ncomplaint bureau of the U.S. Attorney, before the hearing in court. It\r\nis then up to the U.S. Attorney’s office alone to determine whether the\r\ncomplaint will be made.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that, every day, thousands of people mill around in\r\nthis complaint room. An onlooker can’t tell who are cops, lawyers or\r\nprisoners. When the arresting officer speaks to the deputy D.A., he\r\ndoes so in this cut-rate counter atmosphere, before the defendant and\r\nhis lawyer. There is no privacy. The cop has to spill his case to the\r\nopposition. The defense lawyer then sets up an argument for dropping\r\nthe case or reducing the charge. The officials are so harassed, they\r\ntry to dispense with as much work as possible, which accounts for a\r\nhefty proportion of pinches that never get past this bureau.\r\n\r\nSometimes a youngster just out of law school is the “grocery clerk.”\r\nHe makes such grave rulings as deciding not to prosecute a homicide\r\ncharge. These law clerks arrogate to themselves the rights and\r\nprerogatives of the courts. When the D.A. decides to go before the\r\ngrand jury, he usually asks for an indictment for only one offense,\r\neven if the accused has been charged with twenty. Elsewhere the custom\r\nis to indict on each count and try on one or two, leaving the others\r\nhanging over the defendant. That does not happen in Washington. After a\r\nprisoner is discharged and commits a crime in some other jurisdiction\r\nthere is no record for probation officers there of other outstanding\r\ncharges against him. That’s another reason why the professionals like\r\nto practice their trades in Washington.\r\n\r\nThere’s another booby-trap for the law. The prosecuting and corrective\r\nbranches of the government don’t take the cops into their confidence\r\nwhen a prisoner is paroled. Elsewhere the police are notified when\r\na parolee is back on the streets, so they can keep an eye on him.\r\nIn Washington this is considered an invasion of the convict’s\r\nConstitutional rights.\r\n\r\nIf the defendant cannot make a deal before the complaint bureau, his\r\nlawyer is entitled on demand to get possession of the file on his case.\r\nThe place is so understaffed, with not enough stenographers, that the\r\nonly notes in these files are brief pencilled memoranda jotted down\r\nby the Deputy District Attorney. There is never a complete record.\r\nIt is simple for defense lawyers to sneak some of the notes out of a\r\nfile; they’ll never be missed, because no carbon copies are made. The\r\noverworked deputies can seldom remember what they wrote.\r\n\r\nWhen the trial is scheduled, the deputy prosecutor seldom has an\r\nopportunity to read the files, even if there were complete data.\r\nFelony cases are often ground out in District Court at the rate of one\r\nan hour, including time out for picking juries. When a U.S. Attorney\r\nfinishes with one case, the clerk hands him a folder on the next.\r\nThat is the first time he ever saw it. Add to this the fact that the\r\nprosecutors do not work with the police in preparing a case, and you\r\ncan see what “confusion twice confounded” means.\r\n\r\nOne of the most unusual features in the setup of the District\r\ngovernment is the office of the Coroner. Until recently, this\r\nfunctionary, who need not be a physician, had no laboratory. What\r\nhe has now is incomplete. He has no medical examiner and only a few\r\nlow-paid researchers.\r\n\r\nBut he has a swell job, with a ten-year tenure and a courtroom better\r\nthan the U.S. Commissioner’s. The present Coroner has virtually set\r\nhimself up as a judge, with no authority in law, and is said by his\r\ncritics to work with a gavel instead of a scalpel. He is one of the\r\ntown’s most powerful functionaries.\r\n\r\nAmong the many strange quirks of local law is one which requires the\r\nCoroner at times to serve as a constable and to make levies. When\r\nthe Coroner acts as a coroner, he holds court like a judge. And he\r\nthinks he is one, too. He has frequently discharged from custody\r\npersons accused of homicide, who had been held without bail by a U.S.\r\nCommissioner. He often sets bail and discharges defendants on bail,\r\nthough there are no statutes authorizing such procedure, and he has so\r\nadmitted under oath.\r\n\r\nThere have been instances when the Coroner has ruled a death was\r\njustifiable homicide and released the prisoner. Though this is no bar\r\nto subsequent indictment, prisoners often flee the jurisdiction before\r\nthe prosecuting attorney knows what has happened. The law does not\r\npermit the coroner to discharge any person.\r\n\r\nCoroner’s juries are impaneled by that official to meet his own\r\npreconceived ideas and prejudices. There is no requirement that a\r\ncoroner’s juror must even be able to read or write. The salary is $7 a\r\nday, and the Coroner has his favorites. Some men served as many as 31\r\ntimes last year.\r\n\r\nThe Coroner frequently discharges the accused prisoners on grounds of\r\njustifiable homicide, despite evidence that they had committed other\r\ncrimes at the same time, such as carrying concealed weapons or selling\r\nnarcotics. The coroner then shrugs his shoulders and says those things\r\nare none of his business.\r\n\r\nThere have been known instances of jury fixing. Through the proper\r\nchannels, a charge of a death caused by reckless driving has been\r\nreduced to an innocuous misdemeanor or dismissed completely. One of\r\nthe coroner’s deputies was a notorious abortionist who performed the\r\nautopsies on his own victims.\r\n\r\nToo bad Boss Shepherd isn’t around today. He could appreciate what the\r\nbackroom boys have done to the District government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32. MONARCHS OF THE METROPOLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nSince wood-cuts added to the native press the element of pictorial\r\nillustration, cartoonists have caricatured the American alderman.\r\nHis heavy foot is on the bottom rung of the legislative ladder. The\r\n“gray wolves” of Chicago were known around the globe for venality,\r\ndegradation and cold-blooded chicanery. The Tammany members of the\r\nboard, the San Francisco, Kansas City, Philadelphia, New Orleans,\r\nBoston, Albany and St. Louis “city fathers” were in their most\r\nnefarious days gangsters, brothel-keepers and police court shysters,\r\noverlaid with a refined sprinkling of saloon-keepers.\r\n\r\nThat mixture does not reflect the complexion of our Congress. But\r\nwhen, twice a month, they sit as the Board of Aldermen of the city of\r\nWashington, they are about as dignified and statesmanlike as the city\r\ncouncil of Peoria.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution says, “The Congress shall have power to exercise\r\nexclusive legislation over such District.”\r\n\r\nThe actual detail of city government is delegated on the committee\r\nsystem and for all practical purposes the rulers of everything within\r\nthe Columbia confines are 13 Senators and 25 Representatives on the\r\nDistrict committees. In an extremity they can be overruled by their\r\nchambers and the President could veto any of their acts, but no one\r\nremembers when such a thing happened.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain local prestige about being a D.C. committeeman. He\r\nprobably could with impunity drive through a red light or spit on the\r\nsidewalk, or even jaywalk, which no unprivileged person this side of\r\nan ambassador may dare without at least a stiff bawling out. But the\r\nmembers of Congress assigned to weighty national and world problems\r\nshun the task of managing the municipality.\r\n\r\nOf the 38 who are completely responsible for every law, appropriation\r\nand tax measure in this city of almost a million, only two in the\r\n81st Congress came from communities as large as or larger. They were\r\nCongressmen Arthur G. Klein, of New York City, and John F. Kennedy,\r\nof Boston. Only three others in the last Congress came from cities\r\nwith a population in excess of 100,000--Senator Estes Kefauver, of\r\nChattanooga, Tenn., 130,000; Senator Harry Darby, of Kansas City,\r\nKans., 130,000; and Congressman John J. Allan, of Oakland, Calif.,\r\n380,000. Darby is not in the 82nd Congress.\r\n\r\nIn other words, 33 of the 38 Senators and Representatives who ruled\r\nthis metropolis in the 81st Congress were from farms, villages, and\r\nrural towns, that include Fairmont, W. Va.; Lander, Wyo.; Bristol,\r\nR.I.; Middleboro, Del.; Madison, S.D.; Skowhegan, Maine; Burley, Ida.;\r\nFlorence, S.C.; Okolona, Miss.; College Station, Tex.; Scottsboro,\r\nAla.; Stone Mountain, Ga.; Cedar City, Utah; Hammond, La.; Kennett,\r\nMo.; Carrollton, Ill.; Frostburg, Md.; Glencoe, Minn.; Decorah, Ia.;\r\nRosemont, Pa.; and Farrell, Pa. Even those who were sincere did not and\r\ncould not understand the problems of a giant city.\r\n\r\nIn the current Congress there are a few more city slickers on the\r\ncommittee: Senators Butler, of Baltimore; Bennet of Salt Lake, and\r\nPastore of Providence.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, about once every ten years, Congress gets appalled\r\nat its own reflection and decides to investigate its own municipal\r\ncreation. After such probes a few anemic recommendations are submitted\r\nto the Congress, a few minor corrective bills are passed. Then the\r\nspeakeasies and gambling houses reopen, the dope peddlers and murderers\r\ncome out again, and once more life goes on, as Washington life goes.\r\n\r\nThe last time Congress got in a mood of righteous selfexamination\r\nwas in 1950, when a sub-committee of five was appointed by the House\r\nDistrict of Columbia Committee to investigate crime and law-enforcement\r\nin the capital. The sub-committee chairman was James C. Davis, of\r\nGeorgia, a sober and sincere lawyer with a distinguished record as a\r\ncrusading superior court judge and member of Congress. The Congress\r\noriginally voted the handsome sum of $10,000 to this committee, with\r\nwhich it was expected to dig up the dirt on a billion-dollar-a-year\r\nvice establishment.\r\n\r\nDavis determined not to get a political hack as counsel. If he had\r\nnot chosen a dynamic attorney, this committee would have been as\r\ninnocuous as most others. As it was, it uncovered plenty that should\r\nhave rocked the nation and shocked the Congress. It was no fault of\r\nDavis or Hyman I. Fischbach, committee counsel, that it did not. But\r\nCongress, as expected, ignored the report and skipped the record.\r\nDavis and Fischbach came up with suggestions--some far-reaching--for\r\na reorganization of the District police, court system and method of\r\nprosecution. But to guarantee that nothing would be done about it\r\nthe Democratic leadership put road-blocks in the Committee’s path.\r\nNevertheless it is now before the Congress. It will go the same route\r\nothers have, or establish a precedent.\r\n\r\nFischbach, with many years’ experience conducting such investigations\r\nfor other Congressional committees, turned out what a committee counsel\r\nshould be--in happy contrast to the sad picture of the Kefauver group\r\nwhich was operating at the same time. No one could see him getting\r\nfar with his beggarly budget. It hardly allowed for an office staff,\r\nlet alone investigators. But Fischbach hired John Woog, a 27-year-old\r\nwar veteran and member of the New York bar, as chief investigator\r\nand practically the whole staff. Working 18 to 20 hours a day they\r\nuncovered enough rottenness, funny business and stupidity to fill more\r\nthan 1200 closely printed pages of terrifying testimony.\r\n\r\nWhen Fischbach started stepping on some sacred toes the ceiling fell\r\nin. Rumors were whispered around the House Office Building that\r\nFischbach would be canned. Plenty of Congressmen were a-tremble;\r\nFischbach was getting too hot. One who tried to throw a barrier in\r\nhis way was Representative Wayne L. Hays, a Democrat from Ohio, whose\r\nCongressional district includes tributary territory dominated by the\r\nAkron and Youngstown mob which is ruled by Frank and Tony Milano,\r\ncited before the Kefauver Committee as organizers of the infamous\r\nMayfield Road gang, Ohio branch of the Mafia. Hays tried to hold up\r\nmoney for the committee unless Fischbach were fired. He was joined by\r\nMrs. Mary Norton, who retired at the end of the 81st Congress, and who\r\nrepresented Hudson County, New Jersey, and was sent to Washington by\r\nthe notorious Boss Hague. She did not stand for re-election after Hague\r\nwas run out of Jersey politics.\r\n\r\nAnother who opposed Fischbach was Edna Flannery Kelly, of Brooklyn,\r\nwho was chosen by the Democratic leadership to spearhead the campaign.\r\nMrs. Kelly, who serves by grace of Irwin Steingut, minority leader of\r\nthe New York State Assembly, has been an errand girl for the Brooklyn\r\nbosses ever since her election to Congress.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kelly’s reluctance to expose crime in the District may be\r\nunderstandable to New Yorkers who know that among her constituents are\r\nsome of the most evil gangsters who ever slit a throat or lived off the\r\nproceeds of a prostitute.\r\n\r\nThese three button-holed other Democratic Congressmen and said they\r\nwere opposed to Fischbach because, as a New Yorker, he should have\r\nbeen cleared through the New York County Democratic Committee. That\r\nCommittee’s other name is Tammany Hall. To Davis the mere mention of\r\nTammany Hall is like defaming the Stars and Bars. Lack of Tammany\r\nendorsement was the highest recommendation. On such little things is\r\nhistory made.\r\n\r\nIt still remains for the Congress to follow the Davis recommendations.\r\nMeanwhile, all the law-breakers who hid while he was probing slid back\r\ninto business as soon as the “probe” was over.\r\n\r\nFew solons really want home rule, not even Northern New Deal\r\nCongressmen who scream for it because the Negro press does.\r\n\r\nMost of the members shirk the committee meetings, because while\r\nmembership gives them great prestige locally, it means nothing\r\nnationally or to their constituents. The District Committee is\r\na “minor” one, and membership on it does not count against the\r\nlegislator’s allowed minimum of committee appointments.\r\n\r\nFew remain on it for long, and assignment to it is, in a manner, in the\r\nway of punishment. First-timers, especially in the Senate, are hazed\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\nA typical majority member of the House District Committee is\r\nRepresentative Arthur G. Klein, of New York City’s 19th district. We\r\ngive him to you not because he is the most active or prominent, but\r\nbecause he is closest to our home. His district begins a block away.\r\n\r\nKlein, an exasperating and annoying pleader for left-wing causes, has\r\nbeen on the public payroll for 16 of his 46 years, the first six spent\r\non the legal staff of the S.E.C. He has been in Congress since 1941.\r\n\r\nKlein’s district, which runs between the Bowery and the East River,\r\nbelow 40th St., contains not only the worst slums in New York, but\r\nsome of the newest and finest housing developments, as well as large\r\nhunks of the city’s financial district. He promoted the former for his\r\nconstituents at the expense of the latter.\r\n\r\nAlso in it is Manhattan’s downtown Mafia stronghold--parts of Little\r\nItaly--whose voters sent him to Congress and demand favors in return.\r\n\r\nOperating in his district is New York’s most evil and notorious\r\nfairy-haunt, the disgusting 181 Club, at that address on Second Ave.,\r\nwhere every cabaret law and ordinance on the books is fractured\r\nnightly. This profitable venture is overseen by Alan Bono, a cousin of\r\nJoe Adonis, and a contributor to Klein’s campaign funds.\r\n\r\nFormer Congresswoman Norton served 10 of her 26 years in Washington on\r\nthe District Committee. At this writing she has strong backing for the\r\nabout-to-be vacant post of District Commissioner and may so be named\r\nbefore this reaches print.\r\n\r\nEven when not a member of the committee, Mrs. Norton always had a\r\nsoft spot in her heart for it, and frequently interested herself in\r\nDistrict affairs, being given a respectful hearing because of “the\r\nwoman’s angle.”\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Norton was and is and always has been a creature of Boss\r\nHague, one of the most corrupt and thievingest municipal overlords\r\nin the world. At this moment the Hudson County grand jury is working\r\novertime grinding out indictments against ex-officials appointed by him.\r\n\r\nMany Hague specialties were exported to Washington during her tenure as\r\nmayor ex officio, among them a high tax-rate, municipal corruption and\r\nofficial protection for gamblers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Norton’s home town, Jersey City, was, until last year, the\r\nnational clearing house for the laying off of horse bets from all over\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nWhile she was in Congress, Hague was the absentee chief magistrate of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33. WIRETAPPERS, SNOOPS AND SPIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter you’ve exchanged conversation with a number of Washingtonians,\r\nyou wonder what made them decidedly different from others. Then it\r\ndawns on you. They are whisperers.\r\n\r\nThey all seem consciously afraid that they may be overheard. That marks\r\nthem even in casual conversations, and when they utter secrets they\r\nare theatrically overcautious. These are acquired habits, not without\r\nfoundation. All mankind has a common weakness for spreading gossip.\r\nMost people can retail only minutiae. But in Washington, matters that\r\nmay rock the world are entrusted, or pass through the hands of, those\r\nwho otherwise would have little to tell beyond back-fence piddle.\r\nFurthermore, for one to say his wires are tapped is a mark of self\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe capital is overrun by snoops and spies, not only using every\r\ncloak-and-dagger device for foreign transmission, but assigned and\r\ntrained to catch and report inter-bureau information, rumors included.\r\n\r\nAn observation at a dinner table by a member of Congress or an\r\nexecutive may cause an uproar in Moscow, London or Calcutta. Or it may\r\nbring a midnight huddle in a cabinet department or the President’s\r\nsound-proofed den.\r\n\r\nYou meet almost no one of any importance who converses at ease. The\r\nthinnest statement or flattest opinion can be amplified and multiplied.\r\nIf it escapes an official listening post, it may reach a columnist,\r\nwhich is worse.\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable furor on the subject of Washington\r\nwiretapping.\r\n\r\nThat is a topic which every seasoned editor has learned to recognize as\r\nhaving extraordinary human interest appeal. The phone is such a common,\r\nyet tricky instrument, that kitchenmaids who have affairs with delivery\r\nboys shiver with horrible fears that their big secrets are being\r\ntapped. And this is not confined to small people. In Washington such\r\nsuspicions are justified.\r\n\r\nMany mentally connect wiretapping with the F.B.I. The two have been\r\njoined in recurrent publicity. Deliberate left-wing propaganda has\r\nexaggerated and exploited the notion. The F.B.I. uses this method,\r\nas does any other efficient police force. But emphasis thereon is\r\ndisproportionate. The practice is widespread with only a modicum of\r\nuse in criminal investigation. The F.B.I. itself makes a daily check\r\nagainst cut-ins on its own wires, including J. Edgar Hoover’s own\r\nprivate lines. He and his bureau are Enemy No. 1 to the Reds and all\r\ntheir sycophants and sympathizers, the only man in the country who\r\ncalled the shots on the Communist situation since the beginning. And\r\nas the eyes and ears of the Department of Justice, the G-men handle\r\ndynamite affecting interests from car thieves to disloyal U.S. employes\r\nto chairmen of the boards of trusts.\r\n\r\nTapping F.B.I. wires is not a profitable career. The bureau knows\r\nall the tricks. New electronic developments now make it possible to\r\nintrude on some communications without physical contact with the wire.\r\nNo instruments can detect such espionage. This is a hazard beyond\r\nmechanical defense.\r\n\r\nWe said everyone in Washington lives in constant fear and dread of\r\nbeing overheard, even if the subject matter is of importance to no\r\none. It becomes habit. Congressmen and officials are cagey when they\r\ntalk on the phone, though after a few minutes of cryptic conversation\r\nthey forget and loosen up. When you visit the average office holder\r\nin his sanctum he steers you away from the walls, then speaks in an\r\nundertone. In your hotel room his eyes wander around the walls,\r\nsearching for “bugs” which can pick up and record every sound.\r\n\r\nWiretapping is a merry indoor sport in Washington, engaged in by dozens\r\nof agencies--public and private.\r\n\r\nWhen the White House wants to know what’s going on it employs Secret\r\nService experts. They ferret out information about the President’s\r\npolitical enemies, inside and outside the government. It is filed\r\naway for future reference to be used for retaliation or guidance.\r\nSome Democratic Senators and Congressmen use Congressional committee\r\nwiretappers. Investigators get the dope on political enemies in\r\nWashington and back home. Administration leaders tried desperately to\r\n“get” Senator McCarthy and no method was beneath them. Minority party\r\nmembers, deprived of the services of official wiretappers, hire private\r\ndetective agencies. Kefauver complained his committee’s wires were\r\nbeing tapped.\r\n\r\nMany cabinet officers and other high officials usually have their own\r\nintelligence services for spying on associates, the opposition, Hoover,\r\nand even on the President himself.\r\n\r\nForemost among these administrative intelligence sections are those of\r\nthe Department of State, Treasury, Defense, and the Post Office, with\r\nits sureshot inspectors.\r\n\r\nOscar Chapman, Secretary of the Interior, has a fine intelligence,\r\nheaded by Mike Reilly, former chief of the White House Secret Service.\r\n\r\nThe political cross currents are such that at any time five or six\r\nsets of wiretappers, each unaware of what the other is doing, may be\r\nlistening in on a subject’s wires; while the subject may have his own\r\ndicks listening in on the principals whose agents are cutting in on his\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nLike lobbying, wiretapping is an insidious system used by everyone,\r\nacknowledged by no one, so Congress shrinks from delving deeply into it.\r\n\r\nCommunists recently forced the issue into the open, as they did with\r\nlobbying, both of which they use extravagantly. The Senate came up with\r\na weak-kneed investigation of wiretapping. Senator Claude “Red” Pepper,\r\nof Florida, already a lame duck, was appointed to head the committee.\r\nPepper tried to slant the hearings to make it appear the only\r\nwiretappers in Washington were Republican leaders. He named Senator\r\nOwen Brewster of Maine as the goat. About all the investigation\r\nbrought out was that the Metropolitan Police Force is a chief offender.\r\n\r\nPolice Lieutenant Joseph W. Shimon, the cops’ expert, admitted he\r\ndid some outside work on these lines for private clients and for\r\nCongressional committees. Senator Brewster said he paid Shimon’s\r\nexpenses to investigate a man who, Brewster thought, was “shadowing”\r\nhim. It turned out also that Shimon was paid to tap Howard Hughes’\r\nwires when that eccentric nabob was probed in connection with his\r\nwartime airplane contracts.\r\n\r\nAfter the Senate committee spent a lot of time and money investigating\r\nwiretapping, its counsel, Gerhard Van Arkel, who also wants to be\r\nDistrict Commissioner, made a brilliant discovery. He said the group\r\nalready had proved its chief point, namely, “There is a good deal of\r\nwiretapping going on in Washington and it is difficult to act against\r\nthe practice under present law.”\r\n\r\nForeign government operatives compile volumes on the words of our\r\nofficials, as well as from embassies and snoopers of other foreign\r\ncountries. Wiretappers do not expect to garner much direct information,\r\nbut they winnow a thousand talks for one bit that will compromise the\r\nobject of the tap and make him vulnerable to power pressure.\r\n\r\nLobbyists and labor unions get the goods on people they need. And\r\ngovernment wiretappers often listen in on them.\r\n\r\nAdd to all this private intrigue, suspicious husbands and wives, and\r\nyou have an industry.\r\n\r\nBecause Washington is federal property, its telephone setup is governed\r\nby the Federal Communications Commission. FCC rules forbid unauthorized\r\nlistening in on phone calls. U.S. law makes it a crime to divulge such\r\ninformation. Evidence secured by wiretapping may not be used in federal\r\ncourts. Supreme Court Justice Holmes decreed it “a dirty business.” The\r\nstrict rules hamper legitimate law enforcement officers, but do not\r\nhinder those snooping secrets for blackmail or political pressure.\r\n\r\nIn many other states, New York especially, any evidence, obtained\r\nlegally or illegally, is admissible in court, though the detective\r\nwho breaks the law to land it may be prosecuted, but never is. He’s\r\ndecorated, instead.\r\n\r\nNew York law is liberal in extending the right to local peace officers\r\nto tap wires by judicial sanction, ex parte, for specific inquiries,\r\nnever refused. Federal agents working on cases in New York and other\r\nsuch states usually tie up with local cops and prosecute in local\r\ncourts, because the Feds are restrained in their own. In the District\r\nthere is no local law, so the authorities are handcuffed.\r\n\r\nWiretapping is rarely used to procure actual evidence. Judges and\r\njuries don’t like it. But eavesdropping alerts officers and then\r\nthey go after collateral evidence and don’t reveal where the tipoff\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nInstead of developing more stringent legislation which is what the\r\nCommunists, who break every law, want, the radical-sponsored Pepper\r\ninvestigation failed so miserably that many Congressmen agreed the\r\ngovernment should have more power to protect itself by means of\r\nwiretapping. The Department of Justice is sponsoring a bill to permit,\r\nunder some circumstances, the use of evidence in court so obtained;\r\nto be accepted after a Federal Judge issues an order on application\r\nof government intelligence agencies, and to sanction such agencies to\r\nengage in wiretapping directly, not for court evidence, subject to\r\napproval by the Attorney General.\r\n\r\nMany sober observers feel that to forbid the F.B.I. any reasonable\r\nmeans for counteracting treason and espionage is childish prudery, and\r\nthat its bitter opponents are not in good faith.\r\n\r\nYou hear a lot from pinks and phony progressives that the nation’s\r\ncapital is a police state where no man is free to utter his thoughts.\r\nBut most of the spying is done not for legitimate government sources,\r\nbut is privately sponsored by politicians, office-holders or subversive\r\nand inimical interests. Washington is no OGPU camp. Most of the\r\nwork done in the headquarters of federal investigative agencies is\r\nadministrative. They decentralize their field work. The Washington\r\noffices of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, the Alcoholic Tax Unit and\r\nseveral others are branches of the Baltimore division and report to the\r\nsuperintendent there.\r\n\r\nThe Washington field office of the F.B.I. is as remote and as\r\nindependent from the director as, for instance, the ones in New York,\r\nChicago and Los Angeles, and like them is run by an agent-in-charge,\r\nthrough regular channels like out-of-town offices, via Clyde A. Tolson,\r\nthe skillful associate director, and brainy assistant directors Mickey\r\nLadd, Hugh Clegg, Lou Nichols, Dick Glavin, Rolf Harbo, Al Rosen and\r\nStan Tracy before Hoover handles any matter.\r\n\r\nThe agent-in-charge of the Washington field office has as much\r\nauthority and autonomy and is as locally independent as Ed Scheidt and\r\nhis assistant, Bill Whelan, in New York; George McSwain in Chicago, and\r\nDick Hood in L.A., all solid and seasoned chiefs of ability, integrity\r\nand patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe same lefties who are moaning about Washington being a police state\r\nrecently tried to slip a fast one over, to make it so, and at the\r\nexpense of embarrassing and possibly destroying the F.B.I.\r\n\r\nWhen the House Committee Investigating Crime and Law Enforcement in\r\nthe District was drawing up its report, certain sources tried to\r\nsneak a sleeper into it, recommending that the F.B.I. be given final\r\nresponsibility for policing the city of Washington.\r\n\r\nWe have determined that the suggestion was made to sub-committee\r\nChairman Davis by District Attorney Fay who said he concurred in it\r\nwith Peyton Ford, an Assistant Attorney General, with a long record of\r\nsympathy for “progressive” causes. Informed observers wonder if Ford,\r\nwho helped whitewash Amerasia, was acting for higher-ups out to “get”\r\nJ. Edgar Hoover.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to slip this through into legislation. That would mean the\r\nend of the F.B.I. as we know it. It would then become a city police\r\nforce. Its organization would be disrupted, as was the Treasury during\r\nProhibition. It would have to take on thousands of new agents, waste\r\ntime with drunks, whores, policy-slip peddlers and punks, and meanwhile\r\nit would have to take the odium for the conditions portrayed in this\r\nbook, which go deeper than mere failure of police.\r\n\r\nIn recent years it has become the fashion in the movie industry to\r\nproduce whodunit pictures about detective agencies of the Federal\r\ngovernment. The Hollywood geniuses think they have covered all but they\r\nmissed plenty.\r\n\r\n(Note: In all cases their duties are regulated and catalogued by\r\nstatute. None, including the F.B.I., is a genuine and general secret\r\npolice force--such as Scotland Yard.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, their powers and duties are in one of four\r\ncategories.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation “investigates.”\r\n\r\nThe Postal Inspectors “inspect.”\r\n\r\nThe Treasury Agents “enforce.”\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service “protects”--the President and the currency.)\r\n\r\nThe Narcotics Bureau is covered elsewhere in some detail; but this\r\nis as good a place as any to assure you that Federal cops are human\r\nbeings, not machines assembled to turn out convictions. A principal\r\nfunction of the Narcotics Bureau is to combat the dope evil, not to\r\nimprison its victims. This was demonstrated when a famed Hollywood\r\nmovie star went on the junk. The Bureau, in checking prescriptions,\r\nfound she was in the hands of a quack who was ruining her life.\r\nCommissioner Anslinger made a trip to Hollywood to plead with the head\r\nof her studio to give her a year off, so she could go to a sanitarium\r\nfor a cure. She had two pictures in the works and the studio factotum\r\ndemurred. He mentioned her contract, said the company had millions\r\ninvested in the films. He “couldn’t possibly see my way clear.”\r\n\r\nAnslinger warned him she would collapse and the company would lose an\r\nasset worth even more. The young woman was being kept alive during the\r\nday on benzedrine. Afternoons the doctor tapered her off on secanol.\r\nAfter work she was dosed with morphine. The inevitable eventuated. She\r\nblew up completely, tried suicide, was hospitalized and suspended.\r\nThen the government stepped in and gave her the cure. Now she is\r\ndehabituated and rehabilitated.\r\n\r\nThe Intelligence Unit uncovered the huge tax fraud that sent Henry\r\nLustig, former owner of New York’s Longchamps Restaurant chain, to the\r\npen. Many stories are told on how the prosecution began, including the\r\napocryphal one that Henry Morgenthau, then Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nwas forced to stand in line and wait for a table in a Miami cafe when\r\nLustig was ushered in ahead of him; Morgenthau asked who the man was,\r\nexploded and ordered the Feds to get him.\r\n\r\nBut the real story is this: The New York hideaway office of the unit\r\nis at 253 Broadway. There’s a Longchamps Restaurant in the basement.\r\nFederal agents don’t earn enough to afford its fancy prices. They\r\nusually lunch in a counter-joint around the corner. But one day it\r\nrained. Some agents were tied up on a big case, didn’t have time to\r\nwait, so they ducked down in the elevator.\r\n\r\nMany Wall Street financiers lunch there regularly, have tables reserved\r\nand waiting. The only empty one had a “reserved” sign, but the\r\nIntelligence boys grabbed it over the protest of the hostess. When the\r\nmillionaires arrived they had to wait. They fumed. Lustig was there. He\r\nshouted, “Why did you let those bums take that table?”\r\n\r\nService to the “bums” was cut off. They wondered whether the\r\nimperious Lustig’s returns were clean, whether he wasn’t the sort\r\nof individualist who would probably steal. They checked. He had\r\nsequestered $5,000,000 in unreported hatcheck money.\r\n\r\nWhen the Intelligence Unit, nicknamed “The U-Boats,” sent Atlantic City\r\nboss Nocky Johnson to the can, they got him by counting the towels sent\r\nto the laundry by the local cat-houses. This established the intake of\r\nthe madames, and their kickbacks upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe Intelligence Unit has been working on the hidden holdings of the\r\nMafia for years. When evidence in hand is collated, 30 of the most\r\nimportant hoodlums will trade in their tailor-mades for prison denim.\r\nThere’s terrific pressure from higher-ups to stop the forthcoming\r\nprosecution. Only orders from the President or Attorney General will do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSometimes Intelligence runs into amusing situations like the case of\r\nthe rich Chinese and the blonde model. He was a wealthy importer,\r\nnamed Hsieh, in America on a diplomatic passport as the representative\r\nof the Bank of China. Nationalist Hsieh fell for Marion Saunders, a\r\nsensational slick chick with platinum hair, from Indiana. It became a\r\nterrific romance. Cafe socialites kidded that he bought her a new mink\r\ncoat every day.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury heard about the dough he was lavishing on her. They\r\nlooked him up, discovered that as a nonresident alien he was exempt\r\nfrom American income taxes. But Mr. Hsieh had forgotten gift taxes.\r\nUnder the law the donor, not the recipient, is liable for payment--25\r\npercent. The Feds tracked down gifts aggregating $1,000,000--the\r\nuntraced value was far higher. Mr. Hsieh was soaked $540,000--tax plus\r\nfines. He was allowed to pay in three installments. He pulled out a\r\nroll of bills and peeled off 180 G-notes for the down payment.\r\n\r\nSome months later, Hsieh and Marion were married. Ginmill habitués said\r\nhe married her to get his dough back. That couldn’t be so, because\r\none day, last year, the _Queen Mary_ came in with $2,000,000 in gold\r\nconsigned to him. It was landed under guard of six armed Chinese, toted\r\noff in steel-lined limousines.\r\n\r\nWhich reminds us of the story never told before, too good to keep.\r\n\r\nOne of the benches in Lafayette Square, gathering place of the faggots,\r\nacross from the White House, is wired up. You ought to hear some of the\r\ngay conversations. We did. Then we squirted penicillin in our ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE\r\n\r\n(_Confidential!_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34. THE TUESDAY-TO-THURSDAY SET\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most itching urge in Washington is to get away from it. Few have\r\nthe conventional home ties there which bind the average American to\r\nthe hearth, or the radiator. Weekends are dismally dull and shop shuts\r\nup from Friday night until Monday morning, with few exceptions. Civil\r\nservants rate thirty-day vacations. The winters are sleazy and frosty.\r\nThe summers are insufferable in that swampy, flat region which enjoys\r\nno ocean breezes.\r\n\r\nWhere to go? Anywhere. Those who can afford it scram to New York\r\nor Atlantic City. The next layer hightails it for Baltimore or\r\nPhiladelphia. Some fly to far points. Eastern Congressmen and officials\r\nrarely bring their wives and families to Washington, an arrangement of\r\nmutual consent after the rookies have tried domestic life there for a\r\nfew months of high anticipation and depressing disillusionment. Most\r\nCongressmen from east of the Ohio River don’t wait for Friday. They\r\nare known as the “Tuesday-to-Thursday” set, because that’s the point\r\nof departure and return. Frank Roosevelt, Jr. is its most consistent\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nThe great hegira starts Thursday, when the Congressional Limited\r\nleaves, at 4 P.M. For the rest of the day and throughout the night\r\nevery outgoing train and plane is packed and the stragglers fill them\r\nup on Fridays, too. For these trips and returns, hundreds of regular\r\nreservations stand during sessions.\r\n\r\nWeekenders who have no fences to mend or wives to mollify or private\r\npractices to superintend hie to resorts in Virginia and the Carolinas.\r\nBut the pet dreamland of escape for the hiatus is Atlantic City. During\r\nspring and summer the Pennsylvania Railroad runs a through Pullman car\r\ndaily to and from there, via the Delaware River bridge. This is hooked\r\nonto or off the New York-Washington train at North Philadelphia, where\r\nthere is a rush for the club car. The drawing-rooms house either poker\r\ngames or shut-in shebas who long to smell the sea. Teetotal-voting,\r\nBible-Belt solons stagger up and down the boardwalk with potted\r\npatooties on the arms that beat the righteous breasts in the hallowed\r\nchambers.\r\n\r\nThe politicians favor the Claridge in Atlantic City, but the Brighton,\r\nacross the street, is rapidly becoming the gay spot, much patronized by\r\nthose who go up for laughs. Those who want seclusion usually stay at\r\nthe Ritz-Carlton, at the end of the boardwalk and off the beaten track.\r\nThe Ritz was once owned by Enoch “Nocky” Johnson, former Atlantic City\r\npolitical boss, recently discharged from federal prison. Nocky is on\r\nparole now and not supposed to drink or go to public places or engage\r\nin politics, but he does and is still a power in the town and is called\r\non by visiting Washington G.O.P. dignitaries.\r\n\r\nNocky was one of the few leaders with underworld tie-ups prosecuted\r\nduring the Roosevelt administration. Of course, Johnson was a\r\nRepublican, not a Democrat, and the orders went out from Boss Hague in\r\nJersey City to get him.\r\n\r\nMany Washingtonians seeking fun go to Philadelphia, of all places!\r\nPhilly is a natural for married men who want to do a little cheating,\r\nbecause who would ever think of looking for them there? “Sleepy” old\r\nPhiladelphia is not so sleepy. It is one of the hottest towns in the\r\ncountry, loaded with after-hour spots which offer fast floor shows and\r\nrun later than anything in New York.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia is Mafia-controlled, run by the same branch of the mob\r\nwhich owns South Jersey and its domestic wine industry, and Atlantic\r\nCity. Many Philadelphia spots break the law brazenly and openly,\r\nprotected by the Mafia.\r\n\r\nBut Philadelphia has one of the finest restaurants in the world,\r\noperated by one of America’s best-known hosts. This is Jack Lynch’s\r\nZodiac Room in the Warburton Hotel. Lynch has more friends in show\r\nbusiness and high politics than any other man alive. Many top actors\r\nbreak their trips from Washington or Baltimore to New York to stop\r\novernight for an evening with Lynch.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia is two hours from Washington on fast trains. Many\r\nshow-starved Washingtonians, who don’t have the time to get to Broadway\r\nto visit the legitimate theatre, find they can ride to Philadelphia,\r\ncatch a show--there are usually four or five big-time productions\r\nplaying--have a drink, and get back to Washington in time for bed.\r\nWashington wolves go to Philly to howl. Mention New York or Atlantic\r\nCity and a bimbo knows that’s a weekend and all that goes with it. But\r\ninvite her to Philadelphia for an evening, then a few drinks after the\r\nshow--and the last train has left. A lady can’t sleep standing up.\r\n\r\nOf course, New York remains the chief target for weekenders. Those\r\non small budgets stay at one of the popular-priced West Side hotels,\r\nvisit the usual tourist traps, occasionally see a Broadway show, and\r\nhave a hell of a time without spending too much. Government clerks\r\ncome away to New York for a weekend, a man and a woman, going Dutch.\r\nGroups of government girls save up for a trip to the big city. They\r\ngo sight-seeing and gawking, send home colored postal cards and eat\r\nbox-lunches in Grant’s Tomb.\r\n\r\nMost good New York cafes will not serve unescorted women. So the best\r\nthe typists and filers can do is wander around, oohing at the bright\r\nlights and dreaming up lies to tell when they get back.\r\n\r\nThe guys in the bigger jobs have a hell of a time when in New York.\r\nEmbassy people come up regularly and are provided with introductions\r\nto top models by the State Department. Key Congressmen and high\r\nofficials are brought up on junkets by lobbyists, entertained in the\r\nswank joints, and if they don’t have their wives with them they can\r\nhave the best. If wives are along, they are invited by the lobbyists to\r\ngo shopping at places like Saks-Fifth Avenue, Bonwit Teller, Bergdorf\r\nGoodman and Hattie Carnegie, and charge anything they want on the\r\nlobbyist’s accounts.\r\n\r\nThe favorite hangout of the New Deal set in New York is the Stork Club.\r\nThe attorneys for the Stork Club are Goldwater and Flynn. The Flynn\r\nis Ed Flynn, New Deal Democratic boss, campaign manager of the late\r\nPresident Roosevelt. The Stork became a hangout for the left-wing and\r\ndo-gooder crowd during the 1930’s, when the late Supreme Court Justice\r\nFrank Murphy used to cut up on the dance-floor with cuties. Harry\r\nHopkins, the ex-Mills Hotel Hopper, who addressed envelopes at a cent\r\neach, favored its rich menu--on the cuff.\r\n\r\nMany of the important bleeding hearts, labor union leaders and\r\nspokesmen for the have-nots spent and still spend their time in\r\nNew York in the Stork Club, where the have-nots they bleed for are\r\nrigorously barred by silken ropes.\r\n\r\nHere such union bosses as the musicians’ Petrillo, a pal of Truman’s,\r\nand the truckmen’s Tobin, a Roosevelt favorite, are served by a\r\nnonunion restaurant staff. Sherman Billingsley, the Stork’s owner,\r\nhad to cough up more than $100,000 for back salaries and unfair labor\r\npractices. But while he was fighting organized labor the chief union\r\nbosses, all the Roosevelt sons and half the cabinet frequented his\r\nplace. They still do, though the restaurant unions still consider the\r\nStork unfair. But Sherman’s friends see the place is never picketed any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic set, visiting nobility and royal guests of the State\r\nDepartment, and the older Washington dignitaries visit John Perona’s El\r\nMorocco, the swankiest in New York. One may meet ambassadors, princes,\r\na dispossessed king and some South American presidents in Morocco at\r\none time. On these occasions there is more law scattered around the\r\nroom than there are customers in most other clubs. A visiting potentate\r\nlike a sultan or maharajah, in addition to rating a couple of Secret\r\nService men, gets four New York detectives.\r\n\r\nWhen the boys come up from Washington with nothing good on their minds\r\nthey head for the Sun Up Club, in a private house in West 68th Street,\r\nright off Central Park West. This place is run by a couple of sisters\r\nwho used to operate the Hour Glass Club. One, Helen O’Brien, is close\r\nto Joe Nunan, former Commissioner of Internal Revenue and intimate\r\nfriend of Boss Ed Flynn. This place gets away with anything and has for\r\nyears. It freely sells liquor at any hour without a license and without\r\nregard to closing ordinances.\r\n\r\nHelen O’Brien knows a lot of amiable dishes who hang around there. If\r\nthere should happen to be none when a visiting padrone comes in, they\r\nsoon get there. This spot is practically unknown to New Yorkers, few of\r\nwhom, including newspapermen, ever heard of it. It is patronized almost\r\nsolely by august Democrats from Washington.\r\n\r\nVisiting New Dealers pour also into Toots Shor’s restaurant, where\r\nthey are almost as welcome as baseball players and prize fighters. The\r\nlate Bob Hannegan, postmaster and Democratic Committee Chairman, was\r\na regular. Sometimes he brought an unknown Senator from his home state\r\nwith him, Harry Truman, who liked the conviviality of the place and\r\nbent an elbow with the boys. When the Senator was Vice President, he\r\nstopped in and played the piano in the private room. Toots, a genial\r\ngiant, fat and wide and tall, had lunch at the White House with the\r\nlate President Roosevelt and made him laugh. Sometimes at dinner\r\nthere’s more Washington brass at Toots’ than there is in Washington.\r\nToots also runs all non-union. But he can call a cabineteer a\r\ncrumb-bum, and is then set down as a character and a wit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35. BALTIMORE, CONFIDENTIAL\r\n\r\n  (_Authors’ note_: This is a chapter, not the going-over that a\r\n  Lait-Mortimer excavating job on our sixth biggest city, our second\r\n  port in tonnage, truly rates. It is a by-product of this work,\r\n  because aristocratic, historic Baltimore is the slumming-ground for\r\n  thousands of escaping Washingtonians, only 36 miles away over fast\r\n  rails and modern autobahns.)\r\n\r\n\r\nStir up your memory and try to think when and where you have read an\r\n“exposé” or any other study of Baltimore. You can recall pieces, kindly\r\nor vicious, about San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, New\r\nOrleans, Philadelphia, New York, and discussions of the peculiarities\r\nof Boston. But Baltimore, a main-line metropolis, with atmosphere and\r\ntradition and volume and character, is by-passed.\r\n\r\nWe were almost complete strangers there on field-work, though our\r\ntortuous delvings into the continental Mafia-managed Syndicate long ago\r\nfixed for us its place in the national network.\r\n\r\nBaltimore is perhaps the perfect example of a Mafia-controlled city in\r\naction. For practical purposes it is a contraction of Chicago and an\r\nexpansion of Galveston, extreme gangster-throttled cities with the same\r\ncore of Sicilian manipulators who push the buttons and pull the levers.\r\n\r\nItalians constitute one of the largest foreign elements in Baltimore\r\nand can always be depended on to vote in a bloc. Little Italy is\r\ncentered around Albemarle and Fawn Sts., where much of the deviltry\r\nis hatched over “dago red” wine. Add to this the huge colored vote,\r\nwhich also is pretty solidly Democratic, and you have the makings of a\r\nperfect boss-run burg.\r\n\r\nOur investigations into other American municipalities have shown where\r\nthe Mafia dominates there is a disintegration of public morality and\r\nprivate conscience.\r\n\r\nTo this major seaport huge numbers of Italian and Sicilian immigrants\r\nhave always been drawn. They formed the base for its underworld colony,\r\nmade it a star on the Mafia map. It is a concentration point for\r\nillegally-entered Sicilians, stowed away on the freight steamers that\r\nply between the Mediterranean and Chesapeake Bay, by a smuggling-ring.\r\nAs these aliens become Americanized, grow rich and powerful in the\r\nrackets, they import new waves of Sicilians for the underworld’s menial\r\ntasks.\r\n\r\nBaltimore is a favorite hide-out for Mafistas on the lam from\r\nother towns, especially New York, and is used interchangeably with\r\nProvidence, R.I., for that. When one of your authors was assaulted\r\nby Sicilian hoodlums in the pay of Mafia tycoons last spring at\r\nBill Miller’s Riviera in New Jersey, New York police investigating\r\nthe crime were tipped off that the sluggers were being sheltered in\r\nBaltimore’s Little Italy, where they were feted as honored guests at\r\na two-week wedding blowout for the daughter of one of the richest and\r\nmost powerful Sicilians there. More recently, Tony Rotondo, a Brooklyn\r\nex-convict wanted on suspicion of being the torpedo who slew Bill\r\nDrury, was found in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Baltimore has had an infiltration of Puerto Ricans.\r\nIt is in handy sea communication with the Caribbean. It has also\r\nconsiderable air traffic with that area and at a cheaper rate than New\r\nYork’s. The affinity between the Mafia underworld and the new Puerto\r\nRican migrants quickly developed, as it did in East Harlem. Young\r\nPuerto Ricans are employed as dope-peddlers, pimps, and torpedoes.\r\nTheir colony is not large as yet. What it lacks in size is made up for\r\nwith Latin enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nBaltimore’s Negro population is around 300,000. On the whole, the\r\ncolored folk there are more orderly than their neighbors in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. Maryland is still a Southern state and its\r\nwhites will stand for just so much. But Maryland’s Negroes have the\r\nright to vote and they have been taken in hand by the professional\r\ndo-gooders, the New Dealers and other such ilk, who often work hand in\r\nhand with the underworld. The result is that the Negro, the Italian and\r\nthe Puerto Rican votes are often enough to tip the balance in local\r\nelections and perpetuate the criminal rule.\r\n\r\nThis is expressed on all levels with “fixes” necessary and available\r\nfor everything from a special license number which will exempt you from\r\narrest to the go-ahead for a bagnio. (When you see a Maryland license\r\nending in three zeros, you know the car is an untouchable.)\r\n\r\nThe town’s gambling czars are some Comi brothers, some Corbi brothers,\r\nall Italians, and George Goldberg, big in numbers.\r\n\r\nTom Shaw, original owner of the swank Club Charles, also was important\r\nin the gambling firmament until the Sicilians muscled in, taking a\r\npart of his night club as well. Nick Campofreda, a local radio sports\r\nannouncer, was put in as permanent M.C.--not good either.\r\n\r\nThe Century Athletic Club on Baltimore St., was in the fight promoting\r\nbusiness, as well as the central clearing house for bets. The Mafia had\r\ntried long and hard to declare itself in, always without success.\r\n\r\nThe deal was consummated three years ago, after a couple of swarthy\r\nboys from Brooklyn “stuck” it up. Every newspaper printed the story,\r\nbut the cops denied it happened.\r\n\r\nThe Club has surrendered its fight charter, and is now simply a\r\ngambling place. Five leaders of the Sicilian colony are James Caranna,\r\nFrank Gattuso, Tom Lafata, John Maurice, and Joe Palozzolo. They\r\ncontrol the potent minority votes--through threats and payoffs--and\r\ndictate to Baltimore’s political leaders.\r\n\r\nThe town’s top Democratic politicians are Bill “Boss” Curran, a lawyer,\r\nand Jack Pollack, former bootlegger, now in insurance. He runs the 4th\r\nDistrict. Pollack was once arrested for murder but never indicted.\r\n\r\nThey split recently over patronage. Curran nominated his man for\r\nGovernor, but Pollack threw his weight to the G.O.P. candidate, thus\r\nputting a Republican in the State House for the third time since 1864.\r\nHe is expected to remember his political debt to Pollack.\r\n\r\nThe new Governor, Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin, was the last Republican\r\nmayor of Baltimore. He had Pollack’s nod then, too.\r\n\r\nThe Governor can be a nuisance in Baltimore if he wants to, but never\r\ndoes. City police heads are appointed by him, not by the mayor. Beverly\r\nOber, the incumbent commissioner, is “social,” and acceptable. Anyway\r\nMaryland law provides a set term for the top cop. McKeldin is expected\r\nto keep his snoot out of Baltimore--he needs it for re-election; and\r\nits Democratic legislators--who control the legislature--to pass his\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nA powerful Democrat is Senator Herbert R. O’Conor. The R is for\r\nRomulus. O’Conor is a member of the Kefauver committee. Locally he\r\nworks with whatever faction is in power.\r\n\r\nGeorge Muller, 4th ward boss and State Racing Commission Inspector is a\r\nlocal czar.\r\n\r\nJuke-boxes, vending-devices, slot-machines and other Frank Costello\r\nmonopolies are handled locally by Joseph Corbi, of the brothers, out on\r\nbail at this writing after being arrested by the F.B.I. as one of the\r\nchief operators of an international lottery ring.\r\n\r\nSenator O’Conor is the sponsor of a new plan to bring in 36,000 Italian\r\nimmigrants forthwith, mostly from Sicily. The Baltimore underworld\r\nhopes to route most of these to Maryland. But New York’s Republican\r\nSenator Ives has boosted the ante to 130,000. There are more Italian\r\nvoters to appease in the Empire State.\r\n\r\nThe importation of Sicilians, legally and illegally, under the padrone\r\nsystem, is again growing. Huge numbers of aliens have been brought\r\ninto the country and settled in certain key spots dominated by the\r\nMafia, where they work off their fare and keep, usually by acting as\r\ndope-peddlers, numbers-runners or sluggers, or selling their daughters\r\ninto white slavery.\r\n\r\nNow let’s catch up with our mythical refugee from Washington, who comes\r\nto Baltimore for only one purpose--and that’s no good. You can be sure\r\nhe finds what he wants in Baltimore. It’s got everything that’s no good.\r\n\r\nThe visitor’s first impression is of a dirty old town, with ancient,\r\nsmoke-grimed structures and narrow, rambling streets, one-third of\r\nwhich are still illuminated by gas-lights--with Welsbach globes!\r\n\r\nBaltimore is overrun by rubes. And the dress, manners and customs of\r\nmost residents appear provincial. Washington is a city of hicks, too,\r\nbut it is a yokel cosmopolis, with farmers drawn from all sections of\r\nthe country, leavened with some civilized folk and foreigners.\r\n\r\nBaltimore is the market for more chicken-farmers than any other of our\r\ncities. It is the place, therefore, where they come to raise the kind\r\nof hell a chicken-farmer would.\r\n\r\nWashington women on the average seem smart and well-dressed compared\r\nto those in Baltimore. Yet Baltimore has some famous high-fashioned\r\nwomen’s shops which bring customers up from Washington. But the street\r\ntypes don’t patronize them, for they walk around in cheap house-dresses\r\nand shapeless coats of cloth, plush and phony fur.\r\n\r\nThis is the more surprising because Baltimoreans are the most finicky\r\nshoppers in the world. As we write this, the local department stores\r\ninsert a pleading full-page ad in the papers:\r\n\r\n“Gentle Reader.... Over 11,000 purchases daily are sent back to\r\nBaltimore stores. NO OTHER CITY EVEN COMES CLOSE to our percentage of\r\nreturns.... Think how thousands of sales people lose productive time\r\nmaking over 3,000,000 sales a year that come back.”\r\n\r\nBaltimore has a Skid Row that turns your stomach even in Baltimore,\r\nwhere so much of the burg looks like one Skid Row. Next door to and\r\naround the corner from some of the best hotels, cafes and department\r\nstores, you will find nude strippers, B-girls, hostesses and whores.\r\nGuttered drunks and street-walkers may be the badge of the Bowery\r\nelsewhere; here they are a common sight on every street.\r\n\r\nThe visitor heads for one of a half-dozen hotels, all but one of\r\nwhich are almost as ancient as the city itself. The newest, the Lord\r\nBaltimore, is almost a quarter-of-a-century old.\r\n\r\nThe hotels are cozy, but musty. The elderly Belvedere, once the class\r\njoint, is now part of the nation-wide Sheraton chain. Its cocktail\r\nlounge is the only social hangout left. The Emerson and the Southern\r\nare doddering old ladies. There is an air of laissez faire in Baltimore\r\nwhich extends to the inns. If you are quiet and gentlemanly about it,\r\nthey probably won’t throw that broad out of your room. For it is a\r\nfriendly town, as you will have many occasions to find out. Everyone\r\ntalks to you, half the girls you meet want to go to bed with you. The\r\nname of its new airport is Friendship International.\r\n\r\nWhen Judy Coplon worked for the Department of Justice she was\r\nconsidered the most amenable gal there, which made her the most\r\npopular. Harold Shapiro, a good-looking assistant attorney general,\r\ndated her frequently. It was testified at her first trial that they\r\nwent together to Baltimore, where they spent a night in a room in the\r\nSouthern Hotel.\r\n\r\nJudy admitted that, but claimed she did not undress. Shapiro was an\r\nunhappy witness against her, because many thought he had acted for the\r\ngovernment to lure her--kissed and told.\r\n\r\nHe moaned to friends in Baltimore, “It happens to lots of guys. But not\r\neveryone has a G-Man under the bed.”\r\n\r\nThe first item on the tourist’s agenda after he gets out of the hay is\r\nEast Baltimore Street, part of the main commercial thoroughfare. From\r\nGilford Avenue to Fallsway it is Hobo Heaven. You know when you are\r\ngetting to what you want to find when you see a Salvation Army meeting\r\non a street-corner, in front of a barker for a burlesque house. Other\r\ntowns have honky-tonk lanes, too, but this is the only one where it is\r\nthe main attraction.\r\n\r\nSkid Row starts as soon as you walk past the Emerson and Southern\r\nhotels. You are right in the middle of it--a good half mile of avenue\r\nlined on both sides with burlesque theatres, cheap bars, low-class\r\nnight clubs, novelty stores, shooting galleries, penny arcades,\r\nflop-houses and second-hand clothing stores. All burlesques and some\r\nsaloons have hawkers who will pull you in by main force if you hesitate\r\nor stop to look at the pictures.\r\n\r\nThe most famous dump in town is a basement dive called the Oasis\r\nClub. Years ago, when we first visited it, it specialized in a rowdy\r\nfloor-show, with a chorus of elderly relics, their drooping bosoms\r\nunencumbered by brassieres. It is now a strip-joint selling a parade\r\nof nudes, some “refined” with bubbles or fans, pretending to “tease.”\r\nMany peelers make $1,000 a week. But not these in Baltimore. The Oasis\r\nis non-union. The maximum salary is $35. They earn the rest of their\r\nliving sitting out with male customers. We had seen crummy shows\r\nbefore, but nothing quite like the Oasis. Yet, when we stepped around,\r\nwe found it tame for the course.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, where nudes run wild, they never work at floor level. They\r\nare lewd on raised stages or on platforms behind bars. At the Oasis and\r\na good many others in Baltimore, they work on the floor. If you are\r\nsitting at the ringside, you can reach out your hand and tap the babe\r\non her bare behind. And she’ll love it.\r\n\r\nOne or two Oasis girls strip completely, without G-strings, plaster\r\nor anything on. The m.c. mouths continuous patter of dirty talk in\r\nwhich he encourages the customers to tickle the girls--anywhere. The\r\ngirls talk back to the patrons, jump on their laps, stick their bare\r\nbacksides in their faces, in the spirit of good clean fun.\r\n\r\nMax Cohen sold the Oasis to Sam Levin. He agreed to get out of the\r\nstrip business. But he immediately opened another room, around the\r\ncorner, called the Miami. Levin sued for breach of contract and\r\ncollected $50,000. The competition between these two sewers opened the\r\ntown up wider than it had been in decades. Each tried to outdo the\r\nother in nudity. But a girl can’t take off more than all. Meanwhile,\r\nother strip dives found themselves outstripped and had to meet the new\r\nmode.\r\n\r\nThe Miami is around the corner from city hall and police headquarters.\r\nThe mayor can turn at his desk and look into the Miami, and many other\r\ndives. This is one of the most vicious and lawless areas in the world.\r\nThe mayor of Baltimore, whose present term expires in May, 1951, is\r\nThomas D’Alesandro, Jr., a Democrat. He was chosen Permanent President\r\nof the U.S. Attorney-General’s Continuing Conference on Crime and\r\nCorruption last winter.\r\n\r\nMayor D’Alesandro was, before his election as the city’s chief\r\nexecutive, the “Mayor of Little Italy.” His rise to the seats of the\r\nmighty, did not turn his head. He refused to move from the slums where\r\nhe had always lived, at 245 Fawn St. Instead he rebuilt his home into a\r\nmodernistic mansion, a show place surrounded by hovels.\r\n\r\nNext door, and connected, is a new commercial building in which the\r\nMayor operates his insurance business and his wife her home-beauty\r\ntreatment supply company.\r\n\r\nIf the Mayor returns late from a banquet, political meeting or night\r\nsession of the City Council, he will not be forced to travel through\r\ndark and deserted streets. For the immediate vicinity of his home\r\nis the bright light section of Little Italy, where neon-lighted\r\nrestaurants run all night, and serve liquor in tea-cups, and some\r\nopenly in orthodox set-ups.\r\n\r\nKid Julian runs one such place nearby, a mob hangout.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting how Baltimore’s Mayor was chosen to head the\r\nConference on Crime over mob-fighting Mayors Bowron, of Los Angeles,\r\nand Morrison, of New Orleans. We know the inside. We covered the\r\ninaugural meeting in Washington at which all problems were solved in\r\ntwo hours, after President Truman opened it with a pep talk in which\r\nhe said there’d be no crime if everyone read the Bible and stopped for\r\ntraffic lights.\r\n\r\n“Look at me,” he said. “I am the most important man in the world. Yet I\r\ninstruct my chauffeur to stop at all red lights.”\r\n\r\nThat night the President’s car went through 17 en route to a banquet at\r\nthe Statler.\r\n\r\nMayor D’Alesandro’s honor came after he read an intelligent paper to\r\nthe delegates. It came as a surprise that D’Alesandro had such a fine\r\ngrasp on the subject. It came to him that way, too.\r\n\r\nYou see, when he read it, it was the first time he had seen it. It was\r\nwritten for him by a Baltimore newspaperman.\r\n\r\nThe location of the deadfalls in Baltimore reminds us of Galveston,\r\nwhere the gambling and red-light districts, controlled by\r\nSyndicate-allied bosses Sam and Rosario Maceo, are also contiguous to\r\nthe offices of the law enforcement authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Miami Club is on the main floor of a building which advertises\r\n“Rooms Upstairs.” It has some of the most disgusting acts we have ever\r\nseen. Girls in the show will sit out with you on request. Every time\r\nyou pay for your round of drinks--they require you to pay after each\r\nround--the sitter asks you for a dollar tip. The girls who work in the\r\nshow get no commission on these drinks. But if they don’t have a drink\r\nin front of them all the time they risk being fired. Their base pay,\r\nas “entertainers” runs from $20 to $35 a week. The rest they make from\r\nthe tips and from deals arranged for after work. Some of the girls in\r\nthe show aren’t bad lookers. We spoke to one young Puerto Rican, named\r\nAida, who could have gone places in New York if she had any spunk or\r\ntalent. Here all she did was walk around the floor without a stitch on.\r\nOff her it looked good.\r\n\r\nThe m.c. at the Miami, when we got nauseated there, was a fairy. Some\r\nof the older dames in the show are lesbians. Many fags frequent the\r\nplace. The girls told us all that freely, though not free.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the customers are servicemen, riffraff, sight-seers and\r\ndrunks. One seldom brings his wife or girl friend to this place. One\r\nof the nights we were there we saw two policemen and a lieutenant in\r\nuniform, sitting at a table drinking, surrounded by girls. At the\r\nnext table was a wizened little old fellow tossing dough away on the\r\nbroads. We figured him for a chump. But he turned out to be a retired\r\nBaltimore police captain who quit so rich that he can afford to spend\r\n$500 a night, that way.\r\n\r\nMany of the lower-paid employes of the British and French embassies in\r\nWashington hang out at the Miami. Occasionally some of these girls are\r\nbrought to Washington when low down high-jinks are wanted. The Miami\r\nadvertises regularly in the Washington dailies.\r\n\r\nThe waitresses at the Miami seem to be independent contractors. Tables\r\nare not assigned. Customers are continuously solicited for orders by\r\ndozens of different ones. Each carries a purse and you settle with\r\nher after every round. She pays cash at the bar for it. It seems any\r\ngirl who wants to can come in and hustle drinks this way without being\r\nhired. Some wear slacks, others street clothes, and a few sport cheap\r\nevening gowns. They will sit with you with no coaxing. One of our\r\nwaitresses sat down and said, “My tables always buy me a drink.”\r\n\r\nAt the Miami Club we often saw men seated with girls from the show or\r\nwaitresses and making obscene passes--not in booths, right out on the\r\nopen floor.\r\n\r\nBut the ultimate in lowdown shows goes to Kay’s, on Frederick and\r\nBaltimore Sts., across from the Oasis. There is nothing like Kay’s\r\nanywhere, and we’ve seen them all. The dance-floor is about 15 feet\r\nsquare, all tables on the floor. Practically every girl in the show\r\nworks naked and does raw routines within reaching distance of those at\r\nringside. The women, with words and motions that wouldn’t be allowed in\r\nFultah Fisher’s boarding-house, solicit men from the floor. One of the\r\nmost startling dirty acts we’ve ever seen was done by a woman billed as\r\nMoana. She introduced it as her “Whore Dance.”\r\n\r\nHere are some of the sights of East Baltimore Street:\r\n\r\nAt Number 116, a couple of doors from the Emerson Hotel, is an\r\namusement arcade where the kid pick-ups come. Those who like them so\r\ncan walk off with 13-year-olds.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you notice is the profusion of stores and shops and\r\nstands selling “sanitary rubber goods” and other immediate accessories.\r\nIn the lobby of the Globe Burlesque Theatre is a sign reading,\r\n“SALAMI--RUBBER GOODS.”\r\n\r\nA sign in the window of 424 East Baltimore reads “TRY OUR\r\nHAMBURGER--SANITARY RUBBER GOODS--SHOOTING GALLERY IN REAR.”\r\n\r\nMost of these novelty stores and newsstands also sell dirty pictures,\r\nincluding series of snaps showing strips. In one we recognized a New\r\nYork chorine we know. On sale are playing-cards with naked females on\r\nthe faces.\r\n\r\nIn the window of the Maryland Gift Shop, in addition to a lavish\r\ndisplay of “rubber goods” and salacious pictures, are switchblade\r\nknives. The newsstand at Gay and Baltimore Streets has “rubber goods”\r\non display beside newspapers and the usual pictures. Gordon’s Novelty\r\nShop, at 428 East Baltimore Street, hands out a business card with a\r\ndrawing on the reverse side showing a short-skirted cutie standing next\r\nto a young soldier in a rainstorm, with the caption: “Don’t forget your\r\nrubbers.”\r\n\r\nThough we saw “rubber goods” displayed in at least 40 store windows,\r\nnot only on Baltimore Street, but in other parts of town, we can’t\r\nremember seeing so many pregnant women anywhere else. In New York one\r\nseldom sees such displays, even on the streets.\r\n\r\nMany Baltimore Street joints are pointedly pick-up bars. One is the\r\n408. Another is the Midway Bar, where the local hoodlum hot-shots hang\r\nout. Harry’s Bar has strippers and pick-ups. Katherine’s Bar goes in\r\nfor a couple of cheap teasers and a lot of cheap whores working the\r\ntables. Next door to Katherine’s Bar is a sign, “Rooms one dollar a\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\nDown a couple of blocks in the Victoria Hotel, a tawdry assignation\r\njoint, is a dive called Bettye Mills Night Club. It was once known as\r\nthe Stork Club, but Sherman Billingsley brought suit. It has a couple\r\nof long bars where soiled strippers work on platforms, above the\r\nbartenders. While you sit on the stools, dames come over and ask you to\r\nbuy them drinks. This doesn’t surprise anyone, because they do it in\r\nevery low joint in town. Such places have female bartenders, and many\r\nlean over and kiss customers. If not too busy, they come out and sit\r\nwith the trade.\r\n\r\nOne bartender at Bettye Mills is a character known as Mitzie, a plump\r\nlittle broad, a retired stripper. She has a running line of patter. If\r\nyou give her a dollar tip she will pull up her skirt, pull down her\r\npanties and stash the bill in full sight of the customer.\r\n\r\nIn the men’s room is an ad which reads: “Sanitubes for defense, protect\r\nour Army and Navy.”\r\n\r\nBettye is the town’s chief call girl madame, operating through the\r\nhotel switchboard.\r\n\r\nThe Village Bar, 12 Harrison Street, around the corner from Baltimore,\r\nis a pick-up dump with B girls, hustlers and barmaids who go through\r\nthe customers, and we mean just that. Three of us saw a guy get rolled.\r\nHe was a good-looking, well-dressed young fellow, obviously plastered.\r\nA whore in an evening gown sat next to him and pawed him with both her\r\nhands. Then she got up, went to the women’s room for a minute, then\r\ntook a seat by herself at the far end of the bar. When the cluck woke\r\nup, he frisked his pockets for his poke. It was gone. Still in a daze,\r\nhe wandered around the room looking for the dame. She didn’t give him a\r\nglance. He wandered off, befuddled.\r\n\r\nEven the better places have circular bars. We figured that out--they\r\nare better for pick-ups. You can look at the girls from front, then\r\nmotion them. But in most places you don’t have to motion. They\r\npractically attack you. Not even in Chicago are they so voracious. They\r\ndon’t ask you to buy a drink. They move right in and order.\r\n\r\nFew Baltimore B girls work on commission. Most of them live on their\r\ntips, which they solicit after they’ve bilked you for drinks. The\r\nprocedure is for a girl to move in next to you, order without asking,\r\nthen get ready to blow if not propositioned and demand a dollar tip for\r\nher “company.”\r\n\r\nSome saloons which specialize in better-looking ones give them $5 a\r\nnight and they keep their tips and anything they can make after hours.\r\nEntertainers must cadge drinks to keep their jobs. No commissions.\r\n\r\nBaltimore has a 2 A.M. closing, which except in Little Italy is\r\ngenerally observed--one of the few laws that is. These easy hours give\r\nthe girls plenty of time to pick up money after work. A strange sight\r\nis East Baltimore Street a few minutes before 2 A.M. It is lined with\r\nwalls of men waiting for the frails to come out of the bars, strip\r\ndives and burlesque houses. These are not pimps or dates, but men on\r\nthe hunt who saved drink-money and put a ceiling on the commodity.\r\nHundreds of pick-ups are made this way every night, openly in front of\r\nthe few cops there on patrol.\r\n\r\nStreetwalkers pace in front of the filling-station at Baltimore and\r\nFallsway. They are very low-grade stuff. Asking prices start at five\r\nbucks and waver to what they can get.\r\n\r\nParlor-houses have about disappeared from Baltimore, as from most\r\ncities, but there is a line of them in the 600 block, on West North\r\nAvenue. There’s one in the 1000 block of N. Charles, also one next door\r\nto the Blue Mirror.\r\n\r\nMost of the dives are on Baltimore St. and in the vicinity, but there\r\nis no monopoly there. A store next to May’s department store, in the\r\nretail shopping district, has a window display of “sanitary rubber\r\ngoods” and switch-blade knives. Ditto is a shop known as Blizzards,\r\non Eutaw Street, which advertises a bargain, “Three dozen latex, one\r\ndollar.”\r\n\r\nThere’s a strip-dive, the Picadilly, around the corner from the Lord\r\nBaltimore Hotel, in the midst of the financial and retail district. It\r\nhas pretty lowdown floor-shows and swarms with hustlers who work the\r\nbars. We saw one cute bartender there, calling herself Val, about 18,\r\nfrom some mountain town in Tennessee. For a dollar tip she’d let you\r\nplay around and never slap your hands.\r\n\r\nThe joints on East Baltimore are bad--but on the outskirts of town, on\r\nthe Pulaski Highway at Fayette Street, you find places not patronized\r\nby tourists, bums or sailors, but by local kids. You see nude\r\nfloor-shows at the Ambassador, on Fayette, and at De Carlos, on the\r\nHighway, that would make Baltimore Street bums blush.\r\n\r\nThe Big Mob operates or protects the dives. It owns many of the good\r\nplaces, too. Every dump and purveyor of filthy pictures now has a sign\r\nin the window: “Re-elect D’Alesandro.”\r\n\r\nThe better region is along Charles Street, where the more expensive\r\nspecialty and antique shops and the few better-class night clubs and\r\nlounges are. Among them is the Club Charles, part of the circuit which\r\nincludes the Copacabana in New York, the Chez Paree in Chicago, and\r\nclubs in Saratoga, Miami, Las Vegas and New Orleans, which play such\r\nacts as Sophie Tucker and Joe E. Lewis. When the heat isn’t on, a game\r\nruns in the back room of the Charles.\r\n\r\nLess elaborate is the Chanticleer, but far above deadfalls in the other\r\npart of town. It boasts good floor shows and “name strippers.” Among\r\nthe good cocktail lounges in this district are the Coronet and the\r\nBlue Mirror. These are places where men take their own girls or their\r\nbusiness associates. They provide no entertainment, but usually have a\r\nmusical trio behind the bar.\r\n\r\nAs the 2 o’clock closing ordinance is generally obeyed, a problem in\r\nBaltimore after hours is to find a place to drink on the premises.\r\nBut liquor package stores sell until 2 A.M., and most licensees are\r\npermitted to sell for off-premise consumption, too--a procedure\r\npractically unknown in other parts of the country. So, if you still\r\nwant a drink at 2, you buy a bottle and take it with you.\r\n\r\nAsk a cab-driver where you can get a drink after hours and he will know\r\nonly of two spots--outside of Little Italy--Sue’s and Hector’s. Sue’s\r\nis a lowdown dump. Unless you are known, all you can buy there after\r\nthe deadline is beer, which is also illegal. If they know you, they\r\nwill sell you rotgut liquor.\r\n\r\nHector’s is not quite so bad, but it closes Saturdays.\r\n\r\nThe night after we were given a courtesy card to the Press Club, 100\r\nWest Fayette Street, it was raided for selling liquor at 3:30 A.M. to\r\nnon-members.\r\n\r\nThere are many cheating private flats and remodeled homes, especially\r\non Charles St., where chumps are steered from the Club Charles and the\r\nChanticleer, for girls, booze and stud poker.\r\n\r\nBell-boys and hackies can steer you to anything. Baltimore cab-drivers\r\nhave to scrabble for a living. The legal rates are about the lowest in\r\nthe country. You can go almost anywhere in town for a quarter and tips\r\nare meagre.\r\n\r\nGambling is plentiful and easy of access. There are horserooms on Eutaw\r\nStreet, across from the Public Market. Most of the rooms, however, are\r\nin the outlying sections of South Baltimore and Northeast Baltimore. We\r\nfound three running in the 1900 block of Greenmount Avenue and others\r\nin the 2400 block, the 2500, 2700, 2800, and 3300 blocks of Greenmount\r\nAve. There was wide open gambling in the 1800 block, the 2000, 4300,\r\nand 5500 blocks of Hartford Road, as well as the 5200 block of Bel Air\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\nCasinos and horserooms run openly across the County line in Anne\r\nArundel, and a regular scheduled limousine service is maintained to\r\ntransport suckers.\r\n\r\nThe cars leave at frequent intervals from Redwood and South Sts., and\r\nthe Biltmore Hotel, Fayette and Paca.\r\n\r\nSome of these suburban gaming hells are guarded by armed men stationed\r\nin pill boxes commanding the gates.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of one-armed bandits and gambling devices in the\r\ncity, where they are illegal even by local option. At this writing, the\r\ncity itself was in the gambling business with a game room in the new\r\nFriendship International Airport, eight miles south of the city, in\r\nAnne Arundel County, where slot-machines are tolerated by illegal local\r\noption. But the airport is owned by the City of Baltimore, which is\r\nofficially on record against slot-machines.\r\n\r\nInto the game-room of the airport came something new in the way of\r\ntrying your luck. It is a combination cigaret-vender and slot-machine.\r\nYou can buy cigarets at the usual price, 20 cents. But if you want\r\n“action” you put in a nickel instead of the 20 cents, and hope to\r\nget up to 20 packages of your favorite brand--or nothing. The Frank\r\nCostello enterprises are giving the machine its first tryout under this\r\nblessing of legality.\r\n\r\nThe gambling payoff in Baltimore is made through the police. North Side\r\ncops get $10 a week for their services, those on the South Side only\r\n$7.50.\r\n\r\nSergeants rate $25 and lieutenants $50, with higher officers greased\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThe cops collect the take from the numbers men and bookmakers and\r\ndeliver it to their higher-ups, who then transmit the “documents” to\r\nthe gang collector.\r\n\r\nOne reason for this complicated business is a shrewd point of law\r\nto get around the income tax laws. The government will not allow a\r\ndeduction for graft to public officials but if the payoff is taken off\r\nthe top before the mobsters get theirs, then all they need to pay on is\r\nwhat they receive, the net.\r\n\r\nBaltimore is a way-station on the international underground railroad\r\nthat transports narcotics. Considerable foreign stuff comes in through\r\nthe port. It is also brought down from New York in quantity and stored\r\nin the Italian and Negro sections, awaiting transportation in smaller\r\npackages to the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nLocal street sales of narcotics are concentrated on Pennsylvania Avenue\r\nin the Negro district, where individual caps of heroin, morphine and\r\nreefers are available cheap. Puerto Rican and Italian peddlers work\r\nthe white dives in East Baltimore Street, where they sell to whores,\r\nstrippers and B girls, many of whom use it and others sell it.\r\n\r\nBaltimore’s Little Harlem--Pennsylvania Avenue--is more peaceful than\r\nthe Negro section of any other large town we ever gandered.\r\n\r\nThe cops don’t let the colored places get away with anywhere near what\r\nthey act blind to in the white spots on East Baltimore. Some of the\r\ncleanest and best night clubs in town are the black-and-tan resorts\r\nin the Pennsylvania Avenue district. Though whites are welcome, they\r\nseldom visit them.\r\n\r\nGamby’s is an orderly colored night club with fine Negro entertainment\r\nand a small but excellent line of tan chorines. There was no stripping\r\nhere, though one pretty wench, billed as an exotic dancer, shook\r\nswiveled hips but took off nothing. It occurred to us that we had\r\nnever seen a Negro stripper anywhere. The girls of that race refuse to\r\nvulgarize themselves in public to the extent that many white girls do.\r\nNot only was Gamby’s show clean and entertaining, but the customers,\r\nall colored, behaved well and were better dressed than the social\r\nsewage we saw in most of the white dives.\r\n\r\nWe saw no soliciting here. But there was a one-armed bandit in the bar.\r\nWillie Adams is the numbers boss of Darktown.\r\n\r\nThe Negro joints close on the dot, and then the streets fill up with\r\nthousands of laughing, shouting, usually sober merrymakers. White\r\npolicemen patrol the streets in pairs, but at ease. We saw one buck\r\npull a razor on his sugar in front of Gamby’s. Two white cops in a\r\nsquad car drove off.\r\n\r\nBaltimore has a large homosexual population, which is swelled by\r\nvisiting fairies from Washington. On mild nights you can find them in\r\nMt. Vernon Place, under the Washington monument, where they pick each\r\nother up and make liaisons. A favorite gathering place is the Plaza\r\nBar, formerly Longfellows, at Madison and Charles. They also patronize\r\nBall’s and the Harem, the latter a corny night club with two entrances,\r\none leading to a stag bar with a sign on the door, “For Men Only,” and\r\na place on Mulberry near Howard. The lesbians hang out at the Earl Club.\r\n\r\nBaltimore follows the trend of most large cities, other than New York,\r\nin that its best people never go to cafes in town. When they feel the\r\nneed of night life they come to New York. When they want to drink and\r\ndance in Baltimore, they do it at house parties or at country clubs.\r\nSo most of the patrons of Baltimore liquor dispensaries are the lowest\r\nclasses. The few better rooms, like the Club Charles, cater to the\r\nsporty set, big spenders, gamblers, buyers and salesmen and trippers\r\nup for the night from Washington.\r\n\r\nWhen the Charles has a first-rate attraction it advertises in the\r\nWashington papers. For a couple of years the ancient Ford’s Theatre\r\nin Baltimore was the only house within 150 miles of the District\r\noffering legitimate shows. Ford’s gets top road companies and attracts\r\nshow-lovers from Washington, who drive up for a sea-food dinner, for\r\nwhich Baltimore is famous, an evening at the theatre, then take in the\r\ncabaret at the Club Charles.\r\n\r\nBaltimore’s big night life season begins when the races at Maryland’s\r\nfamed tracks bring in loose money from all over the country. Then\r\nthe town is brilliant, gambling is rampant and the whores cash in on\r\nbonanza.\r\n\r\nThe city is the center of the so-called “Minor League” racing circuit.\r\nThere are five half-mile tracks in Maryland, which run almost all\r\nyear, with unknown plugs and has-beens, raced by “Gypsy” horsemen.\r\nThese are a unique breed. They own one or maybe two nags, which they\r\nmay have picked up for dog-meat money. They train them themselves and\r\noften are their own jockeys. It is not uncommon for them to live in the\r\nstables with their horses and even travel from track to track on the\r\nhorses’ backs. The entry fees at these tracks are as low as $10 and a\r\n$100 purse is something to shoot at. The shenanigans at these tracks,\r\ncontrolled by the gamblers in Baltimore, are atrocious.\r\n\r\nThis smudgy picture of the Baltimore that embraces the visitor brings\r\nup the question: How Come?\r\n\r\nThis city of H. L. Mencken has long prided itself upon rebellion\r\nagainst what most of its citizens believe to be an invasion of their\r\nprivate rights. Prudery was never profitable in Baltimore. The\r\nProhibition Amendment was deported as an undesirable alien.\r\n\r\nOne old-timer said, “You think this is something? You should have been\r\nhere 50 years ago!”\r\n\r\nBaltimore, the mid-Continent seaport, is one of the most provincial\r\nof Eastern cities. In some of its set ways it is a backwash to the\r\ncolonial days and the cavaliers.\r\n\r\nYet Baltimore is the “big city” to thousands of hillbillies from the\r\nnearby mountains of Western Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, and\r\nthe poor white trash of Maryland’s Eastern shore counties on the\r\nseaboard, and Delaware. They are the folk who trade and settle in\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\nIt took us some time to figure out why there were so many pretty young\r\ngirls whoring in Baltimore. If they left home to sell it, why didn’t\r\nthey go on to New York? Research showed they came from the nearby hills\r\nand farms; even those with roots deeper in the South or in the reaches\r\nof West Virginia came to Baltimore because that was as far as their\r\nsmall savings or imagination could get them. Some planned to make the\r\nmajor league when they saved up a roll, but they were the exceptions.\r\n\r\nOne girl put it up to us frankly. All she had to offer was all she had.\r\nNew York, the word has spread, is closed to hustling hucksters. New\r\nYork’s market trades through switchboards for smartly turned-out call\r\ngals, models, chorines, pent-house patooties. A rosy-cheeked milkmaid\r\nin gingham dress, with no capital, would be pinched and jugged if she\r\nwinked to a Sand Street sailor.\r\n\r\nThe hungry harlots on Baltimore’s streets and in its stinking saloons\r\ncome there because the whisper back home is that it’s the place to go\r\nto. Often procurers have brought them and started them, or they are\r\nbeckoned by bims who are there. “Bread of infamy” has more raisins than\r\nhome-baked loaves.\r\n\r\nAfter soliciting at the bars a while, some get ambition. They see\r\nstrippers don’t even know how to walk across a stage, a requisite in\r\neven repellent Chicago. They need only take off clothes, and all gals\r\nknow how to do that.\r\n\r\nFew, if any strippers, except at a couple of places that import\r\nsemi-names, were ever in show business before. Pretty soon they’re\r\nlocal celebrities, with a special following. These nude numbers are\r\nheart-breaking to Broadway-wise guys who’ve known the best. Few have\r\nlooks, none have wit, and at $35 a week most of these stag-show\r\nstrumpets are overpaid.\r\n\r\nLike New York, New Orleans and San Francisco have flavor, Baltimore\r\nexceeds both as a ship port, yet it has little appeal for travelers.\r\n\r\nSeafaring folk whose vessels bring them into Baltimore’s fine harbor\r\nare an unromantic lot. No important passenger ships call. Those that do\r\ncarry steerage. Its freighters are cattle-ships and oil-tankers.\r\n\r\nIn the thousands of uniform flat-front red brick homes with the\r\nbalustradeless white stoops, unique to Baltimore, live good, solid\r\npeople, white and Negro.\r\n\r\nThe department of political skulduggery, though, in the Free State\r\nmetropolis, is a streamlined model, oiled up and with all the gadgets.\r\n\r\nBaltimore is exceeded in population only by New York, Chicago,\r\nPhiladelphia, Los Angeles and Detroit. It has passed Boston, St. Louis\r\nand Cleveland, and is growing. It is a combination of an anachronism\r\nand a boom town. Labor is flocking in to work its mushrooming airplane\r\nfactories, huge wholesale trading houses, needle-trade shops and ship\r\nworks. These are mostly people without roots.\r\n\r\nBut Baltimore is getting the gravy that overflows from crowded\r\nWashington, the hot money out for the kind of fun not tolerated in\r\nthe District. Baltimore is somewhat in the state of development\r\nChicago knew four decades ago. That city’s political morality is\r\nstill primitive. The same trend is manifest in Baltimore. Yet crimes\r\nof violence and serious felonies are not as pronounced as in either\r\nWashington or Chicago.\r\n\r\nMost citizens are openly on the side of the law-breakers, too; the\r\nconcepts of liberty and non-interference play into the hands of the\r\nhoodlums and the harpies.\r\n\r\nAt this writing, any and all forms of vice are tolerated and protected.\r\nThere is a price for everything, and it’s not much. In fact, it costs\r\nonly $500 to jump to the top of the police promotion list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOUR\r\n\r\nTHE LOWDOWN\r\n\r\n(_Confidential!_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36. INSIDE STUFF\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sharpie who got tired of selling the Brooklyn Bridge moved into the\r\nDistrict and now sells the Washington Monument.\r\n\r\nSuckers aren’t born at the rate of one a minute, Washington never does\r\nanything on time; but the Union Station and the airfield pour them out\r\nday and night. And God made them marks. For they are either simpletons\r\nwith cow-dung on their boots or they are the conman’s dream, the lunk\r\nwith larceny in his heart. Those who don’t come to Washington to\r\ngawk come to get. And the little chiseler is a setup for the bigger\r\nchiseler. The characters in “The Gilded Age,” by Mark Twain and Charles\r\nDudley Warner have shaved off their beards, but otherwise are still\r\nwith us. Men with grandiloquent schemes, who think a Congressman\r\nfrom their county can land them a $10,000,000 contract for the quick\r\nconversion of a barn, are ready-made for the polished pros who can wrap\r\nthat up for them and who set themselves forth as “expediters.”\r\n\r\nThey confide, sotto voce, that they have connections which they can’t\r\neven breathe about; they hint with delicacy that certain people must\r\nbe reached, and for that purpose advance funds must be placed in hand,\r\nafter which the expediter will gladly accept a small commission on the\r\ncompleted deal--as, if, and never.\r\n\r\nThat is only one, but the main one, of the lines. Nowhere else are\r\nthere so many men and women who live in luxury and are guilty of\r\nvagrancy. In a community of nonproducers, where there is a minimum of\r\ntangible exchange, the nature of man breeds agents and agents’ agents,\r\nbecause the liveliest industry is “getting to” people who can or could\r\ndeliver golcondas.\r\n\r\nThose who are not big-time enough to know people can know people who\r\nknow people, and do nicely on the far fringes. They case a “prospect”\r\nand work him on whatever he is after. His principal occupation will be\r\nwaiting--waiting; thus he will have the time as well as the temperament\r\nto be plucked. In that atmosphere the crudest con-games flourish. Never\r\ntrust a stranger in Washington. Gyp-and-clip carney operators who are\r\nrun off the lot because they can’t shill a rustic to a ten-cent wheel\r\nof fortune, come here and take executive vice-presidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. Swindlers with Swank_\r\n\r\nBeware of smooth-gabbing guys who drive around in big black limousines\r\nwith chauffeurs and live in costly apartments staffed with butlers,\r\nhousekeepers and valets. Some may be on the up-and-up. But, what with\r\ntaxes and cost of living, few square shooters can afford such luxury.\r\n\r\nA few we know:\r\n\r\nOne has an “in” in the reservation departments of the big hotels. He is\r\ntipped off to the prospective arrival of a wealthy chump. This is how\r\nhe worked one case: When Mr. Money arrived at the airport, the grifter\r\nhad him paged, then introduced himself with a bunk story, such as being\r\na friend of the hotel manager, who had asked him to pick up the boob.\r\nThe lamb lamps the limo and is sure the glib gypster who is giving him\r\na lift is okay. The wire has been properly briefed on the stranger’s\r\nhabits. He knows he’d go for a little life, so he suggests they go to\r\nhis suite for a slug. In a little while, a couple of babes happen in.\r\nSoon everyone is drunk and undressed. That’s when the pictures are\r\nground out. One metal-manufacturer went for $35,000, left town next day.\r\n\r\nAnother sold the famous Muscle Shoals Dam to a former Congressman from\r\nNebraska for $50,000. He used Henry Ford’s name as a reference and\r\nflashed a phony letter from him authorizing the sale.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, in another administration, this same tip-and-tosser\r\ntried to sell forged documents to the President and Vice-President and\r\nother high officials. He said they were found in the clothes of a dead\r\nman on the street. The papers, if genuine, were so hot they would have\r\nblown up the government.\r\n\r\nIf someone tells you he can let you in on the inside of a hot oil deal,\r\nand then introduces you to a couple of “prospectors” who just arrived\r\nfrom Kentucky, call the cops, especially if one is an Indian with long\r\nplaited hair and the other is dressed like a vaudeville comedian’s\r\nidea of a Southern Colonel. These fast workers make a splendid living\r\npeddling queer securities from an office on the sidewalk in front of\r\nthe Ambassador Hotel, at 14th and K. They have a fabulous well in\r\nKentucky, and they guarantee it is producing. It is. One barrel a day.\r\n\r\nThey mooch strictly person-to-person. They do no business through the\r\nmails, so they are clear of the Post Office and the SEC. Many of their\r\nmeat are middle-aged and elderly women, widows with a small amount of\r\ninsurance or a modest business like a rooming-house preferred. But they\r\nwill tackle tough touches, approached originally by dames.\r\n\r\nWatch out for anyone you meet in a hotel who offers to get you a dame.\r\nOdds are you will end up in a barrel, running second in a badger-game.\r\nThe boys tried it on a Washington newspaperman recently, but for once\r\nthey saw the back of the eight-ball. Not only didn’t the reporter\r\nhave any money, but he knew the right cops. He ended up borrowing a\r\ncentury-note from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_B. Fortune-tellers_\r\n\r\nReading the future is big business and strictly sanctioned by law, at\r\nan annual fee of $250.\r\n\r\nWives of high officials, members of Congress, and society dames are\r\npushovers for this kind of flimflam, and fork over sums to astrologers,\r\npalmists, psychics, clairvoyants, and other such miracle-mongers. Many\r\ngovernment officials furtively consult fortune-fakers. (Look at the\r\nstate the country is in now.)\r\n\r\nThese thimble-riggers advertise openly. Most of them state “Licensed by\r\nthe District of Columbia,” which convinces the morons they have been\r\ninvestigated and certified by government authorities.\r\n\r\nOne dame, Madame Harrison Astor, states “... prides herself on the fact\r\nof being the only palmist in the world who during her stay in England\r\nhas been officially summoned to the St. James’ Palace to read for his\r\nlate Majesty King Edward VII.”\r\n\r\nMartha Mar Vell, who advertises herself as a palmist, clairvoyante,\r\nmedium, spiritualist and practitioner of spirit ember and Egyptian sand\r\ndivinations, haughtily warns, “Please observe hours.”\r\n\r\nMany fortune-tellers are on the con, hoodwink the superstitious into\r\ninvesting in shady enterprises; they often do not even go that far, but\r\nrelieve them directly of money to cure the evil eye and the hex.\r\n\r\nSome legislators and high officials make no moves without consulting\r\ntheir favorite psychics. That is why they are licensed here, whereas in\r\nother cities, when they get by, it is sub rosa.\r\n\r\nSome oracles who boast august personages or their wives in their\r\nclientele are in the pay of foreign governments, Communists, lobbyists\r\nor fingermen for thieves. Lawmakers or law enforcers come to the\r\nmediums or diviners to seek advice from the spirits or the stars and\r\nget what the swindlers have been paid to tell them.\r\n\r\nGypsies never had it better. Most of them don’t bother to buy licenses.\r\nAs this was being written, a gypsy fortune-teller was under indictment\r\ncharged with using such props as torn diapers, a red candle and a\r\ndepartment store ladies’ room, to skin three Washington housewives\r\nof $450. Police said Julia Nichols would show up at a woman’s home,\r\nannounce she was a church-worker, then tell the housewife she was\r\nhexed. She would ask for money, a handkerchief or diaper. She would\r\ntear the cloth in half, fold the money in it and depart to have it\r\n“blessed.” And blessed if she would return!\r\n\r\nRituals were involved, the police said. In one case Miss Nichols\r\nallegedly placed a silver dollar in a glass of water and told her\r\nvictim to park the tumbler in a bureau drawer. In another, she\r\nallegedly enclosed the money in a diaper, with flour, salt, and a\r\nlength of the housewife’s hair. In a third case, police said, the\r\ngypsy led a victim from her home to a department store rest-room\r\nbefore taking her money. In another, she allegedly left a housewife’s\r\napartment with the currency after giving her a red candle to light and\r\ntelling her to recite the Lord’s Prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. Free Loaders_\r\n\r\nA shrewdie can live here forever on the cuff. A gate-crasher, if\r\nwell-dressed, can be choosy about eating and drinking gratis. Every day\r\nthere’s a profusion of breakfasts, lunches, cocktail parties, dinners\r\nand late suppers thrown by lobbyists, corporations, officials, pressure\r\ngroups, embassies and social climbers.\r\n\r\nAdmission is by invitation, but bids are sent out broadside.\r\nOrganizations and lobbyists exchange mailing lists, even take names out\r\nof directories. Almost anyone who cares to get on such a roster can.\r\nOnce on, his name makes all others. If he isn’t entered, it is simple\r\nto mooch an invitation from someone who has one, because few use them.\r\nFew large affairs are well guarded. It takes little ingenuity to walk\r\nin nonchalantly and act like a belonger.\r\n\r\nThe gate-crashers turn up in the unlikeliest places, maybe breakfasting\r\nat a press conference given by ladies of the W.C.T.U., lunching at a\r\nradio salesmen’s convention and dining, in tails and white tie, at a\r\ndebutante’s ball.\r\n\r\nBeds, and what goes with them--gals--can be stiffed, too. Those who\r\nmake the lobbyists’ lists are invited to the wild parties in the hotels\r\nand mansions, where all that is on the house.\r\n\r\nA friend of ours, a Congressman, told us this story. He was walking\r\ndown Connecticut Avenue, past the Mayflower Hotel, on his way to dine\r\nat Harvey’s. He bumped into an acquaintance, a press agent from New\r\nYork, who insisted the Congressman eat with him. “I’m going up to a\r\nswell private party at the Mayflower,” he said. The Congressman went\r\nalong, had a wonderful meal, with wine and cigars, and soon pretty\r\nblondes began to mix. The satisfied legislator turned to his friend and\r\nsaid, “Gee, this is a swell party. I’d like to thank the host. Who is\r\nhe?” The press agent said, “Damned if I know. I’ve been trying to find\r\nout all night.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_D. The Introducers_\r\n\r\nNowhere else on earth, including New York, are there as many guys who\r\nmake their livings introducing people. These articles thrive because\r\nthey are personality-plus ghees with guts, who know right people,\r\nand if they don’t they go through the motions. If you want to meet\r\nsomeone--cabinet officer, army brass, congressman, fixer, or social\r\nhostess--these birds will introduce you--no hoke. They can get you\r\ninto the White House to meet the President. They play poker with\r\nGeneral Vaughan.\r\n\r\nThese fellows are functional. They are the catalysts who bring various\r\nelements together. When they assume a contract from an industrialist to\r\nintroduce him to a bureau chief, they serve for the bureau chief, too,\r\nby introducing him to the industrialist from whom he will get favors in\r\nreturn for favors.\r\n\r\nSome of the introducers work for straight fees. Others, smoother, are\r\ntaken care of in politer but more lucrative ways, such as getting on\r\nthe inside for a hunk of stock or a chance to buy government surplus\r\nfor peanuts or other charming get-rich-quick methods.\r\n\r\nYou can be introduced to charming ladies, too. Polished procuring is a\r\npolite profession. No lush-rolling or extortion involved. It is honest\r\npimping. Yet, little Rollo, there are still some honest gentlemen in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37. TIPS ON THE TOWNS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Booze_\r\n\r\nWashington consumes four times as much hootch as the entire state of\r\nMaryland, including Baltimore, which alone has 200,000 more population.\r\nThe most popular kind of liquor is bourbon, suh, with rye next. Only\r\nfairies, English diplomats, New Yorkers and spats-wearers drink Scotch.\r\n\r\nThe legal liquor closing for on-premises consumption in the District\r\nis 2 a.m. on weekdays and midnight on weekends. Only beer and light\r\nwine may be sold on Sundays. Baltimore sells until 2 a.m., seven\r\nnights a week, though some saloons which do not serve food and which\r\npay a lower license fee must close their bars at one. (But you can sit\r\nthere until 2 to finish anything you bought earlier.) Only beer and\r\nlight wine may be sold for on-premises consumption in Virginia. The\r\nclosing hour is midnight. Prince Georges, Md., has a law similar to\r\nWashington’s--seldom observed.\r\n\r\nLegal boozing age in the three jurisdictions is 21, though minors over\r\n18 may drink beer in Maryland and D.C.\r\n\r\nBut there’s something about the climate--everyone looks older than he\r\nis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cabaret Info_\r\n\r\nMost District area night clubs do three shows nightly, at 8, 10:30 and\r\n12:30, and two on Saturdays and Sundays, at 8:30 and 12. The hotel\r\ngrills do two, at 8:30 and 12.\r\n\r\nThe burlesque joints in Baltimore grind continuously until 2.\r\n\r\nFew Washington night clubs impose a cover charge. All have minimums,\r\nusually a dollar or $1.50. The hotel cafes, when presenting expensive\r\nattractions, usually put on a couvert up to $2.\r\n\r\nIt’s agin the law and the rules of the American Guild of Variety\r\nArtists to permit female entertainers to sit at tables with male\r\nguests. The hotels and the better Washington night clubs enforce\r\nthis. The others wink at it. There is no attempt at observance in the\r\nMaryland suburbs or in Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Checks and Chicks_\r\n\r\nWhen the cutie in the checkroom hands you back your hat, don’t think\r\nfor a moment she keeps the tip you slip her. She works on a straight\r\nper diem for a concessionaire, who pays the restaurant or hotel by the\r\nyear. But if she doesn’t turn in a tip for every hat, she loses her\r\njob on grounds she swiped the money or she is so stupid or icky that\r\nshe gets stiffed. For many years, the minimum hat check in New York by\r\nhabit has been two bits, but the hoosiers who come to Washington get\r\nlavish with a dime or sneak off ignoring the plate with the decoy coins\r\nentirely. The concessionaire figures 18 cents as the average tip and on\r\nthat basis he checks his employes. The gals learn how to pinch part of\r\nthe loot from liberal tippers, though their uniforms are made without\r\npockets. Photo concession girls may keep their tips, but cigaret girls\r\nhave to turn theirs in.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clip Joints_\r\n\r\nBeware of the invitation from the stranger you meet at the bar, who\r\nsuggests you go to a friend’s place after hours for liquor and gals.\r\nThere are at least 300 clip joints running in Washington, most of them\r\nin the colored neighborhoods, in private houses and flats, where you\r\ncan get booze of a sort after-hours; but it may be spiked with knockout\r\ndrops and you will wake up rolled and robbed--if you wake up at all.\r\nBaltimore clip-dives operate more closely to the orthodox custom. As\r\nsoon as you sit down in a hideaway, a couple of bimbos rush to your\r\ntable and order drinks. When you are ready to go, you get a bill that\r\nincludes the month’s rent. If you don’t come across, you’ll be lucky to\r\nget out with a broken nose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dancing_\r\n\r\nIf your specialty is the rumba or samba, don’t expect to find a partner\r\nin Washington or Baltimore, They’ll do a shaky fox trot to that music.\r\nThe codgers still do the old conservative dances. The youngsters are\r\njive maniacs.\r\n\r\nAt this writing, there are no public dance halls in Washington where\r\nyou can meet partners, but, though table hopping is supposed to be de\r\ntrop, you won’t have any trouble getting dames on the loose to dance\r\nwith you. As in Baltimore, they will solicit you for dances, even if\r\nthat’s all they’re after.\r\n\r\nAll night clubs, but few hotels, present dancing on Sundays in\r\nWashington and Maryland.\r\n\r\nFor matinee and cocktail dancing consult the appendix or the daily\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dates_\r\n\r\nIf you still can’t get yourself a girl after having read this book, we\r\ndon’t think you’re trying. But here are some easy ways:\r\n\r\nAsk the bell captain.\r\n\r\nRefer to appendix for a list of dance studios.\r\n\r\nCall Clara Lane, Friendship Center, Republic 3504 (Washington), for\r\npersonal interview.\r\n\r\nGet a manicure.\r\n\r\nRead the newspaper ads for dances run by the State Societies.\r\n\r\nJoin a church or the Y.\r\n\r\nIn the summer, go to any beach or take a ride on a Potomac steamer.\r\n\r\nStrike up a “Haven’t I met you somewhere” with any girl you see in a\r\ncocktail lounge or a hotel lobby. For that matter, your chances are\r\ngood with almost any girl you see anywhere in Washington. She may say\r\nno. We bet you five to three she won’t.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dining_\r\n\r\nWe will recommend no restaurants here. A list of best-known places in\r\nWashington and Baltimore will be found in the appendix. We guarantee\r\nnone. But Baltimore goes in for good food in the good places, while\r\nWashington doesn’t know what fine cuisine is. Meals are cheaper in\r\nWashington than in New York. Baltimore, with some of the finest\r\nrestaurants in the country, charges even less.\r\n\r\nMost people dine early in both towns. Some of the best restaurants\r\nclose for the night at 8 or 9. This is the Keokuk touch.\r\n\r\nWashington politicians hang out at Harvey’s and the Occidental. They\r\ndon’t mind the insults. Some of the better food is at Olmsted’s. The\r\ntax-payers foot the losses of the dining-rooms in the Senate and House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\nBaltimore politicians dine in the back room of the Emerson; the ward\r\nheelers eat at Bickford’s, called “No. 10 Downing Street.”\r\n\r\nThere are no swank dining places of the grade of El Morocco, the Colony\r\nor 21 in Washington or Baltimore. The elite in government service eat\r\nlunch in their own private dining-rooms and dinner at their clubs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Divorce_\r\n\r\nThe divorce rate in the District, as well as in Maryland and Virginia,\r\nis considerably below the national average, though the grounds are not\r\nparticularly oppressive. At this writing there are 4,000 divorced males\r\nin the District of Columbia and 8,000 divorced females.\r\n\r\nAll three jurisdictions require one year’s residence before beginning a\r\ndivorce action, which eliminates them from competition with Nevada or\r\nFlorida. If the grounds are out-of-state, it’s two years in D.C. You\r\nhave to wait six months after a District decree before remarriage.\r\n\r\nGrounds for divorce in the District are adultery, desertion for two\r\nyears, conviction for felony, and living apart five years. Maryland\r\nadds impotence and insanity. Virginia also grants divorce for\r\nimpotence, pregnancy of wife at time of marriage and wife’s unchastity,\r\nas well as all causes specified in the District.\r\n\r\nSome smart lawyers know how to beat the residence provisions, but if\r\nyou can afford that kind of a lawyer you’re much better off going to\r\nstates that specialize in hot-cake divorces.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Guns_\r\n\r\nYou require a license to carry a concealed weapon, but no one enforces\r\nthe law if you keep a dozen machine-guns in your house. The courts\r\nhave ruled you are not carrying a concealed weapon if you have a gun\r\nin the glove compartment of your car or if you have an unloaded one in\r\nyour pocket, even if you have cartridges on you. Cops can’t pinch you\r\nwithout a search warrant.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Small Arms Act, enforced by the Alcoholic Tax Unit of the\r\nU.S. Treasury, imposes a $300 tax on transfer of certain firearms\r\nand forbids any felon to carry a pistol. But this is practically\r\nunenforceable in the District, because of the niggardly appropriations\r\nof Congress and the disinclination of federal judges to sentence anyone\r\nfor anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hotels_\r\n\r\nIn most towns we warn first-time visitors to beware of cab drivers who\r\nsteer them to hotels they don’t want to go to. But Washington hotels\r\nare usually so crowded, you’re lucky to be steered. We have seen people\r\nsit in lobbies from early in the morning until midnight, while the\r\nclerks phoned all other hotels, trying to take care of the overflow.\r\n\r\nDo not come to Washington unless you have made a reservation in\r\nadvance. Be sure the reservation is confirmed. A few hotels are part\r\nof nationwide chains, among them the Mayflower (Hilton), the Hay-Adams\r\n(Manger) and the Statler. You can probably make your reservations and\r\nhave them confirmed in your own home town.\r\n\r\nHotel rates are high. The cheapest single room in the first-class\r\nhotels is $8, and that faces the garbage cans. Modest suites are $20 a\r\nday, and you pay at least $25 for anything decent.\r\n\r\nBut Washington abounds with cheap assignation hotels, where you can\r\ntake a broad for the night for three bucks, no baggage required. In\r\nBaltimore you can find this kind for as little as one dollar a night.\r\n\r\nFew good Washington hotels have any qualms about your morals. If you\r\nare raided because that gal isn’t your wife, it is because the house\r\ndick and bell captain have their own stable of fillies and they get\r\nno cut-in from outside competition. The “security officer” (refined\r\ndesignation for a house dick) of one of the oldest and most famous\r\nhotels in Washington, near the White House, was recently fired because\r\nhe ran a shakedown racket, putting the bite on guests who brought dames\r\nin.\r\n\r\n(_Inside stuff_: Smart guys start charge accounts in hotels and have\r\ntheir bills mailed to their offices. That way, if they suddenly make\r\na date, they can call and have a room prepared for them. Hotels do\r\nnot like to cash checks for strangers, but will for those with charge\r\naccounts. It is a specific crime to defraud an inn-keeper.)\r\n\r\nWashington and Baltimore hotels, unlike those in northern cities, are\r\nnot required to serve or admit Negroes.\r\n\r\n(Unless you are expecting a guest, do not open your door if someone\r\nraps on it. Many people have been robbed, raped or assaulted that\r\nway. When the girl with the nice voice phones and announces she’s\r\nfrom Harris & Ewing, the photographers, and read you were in town and\r\nwanted to take your picture, don’t think you are a celebrity. This firm\r\ngoes through all registrations, plays for the chumps. After you pose\r\nfor their photos, a glib salesman sells you a dozen. We wouldn’t have\r\nminded, but they phoned us at three in the afternoon, and we never get\r\nup until four.)\r\n\r\n(_Tips_: And that’s the only way you’ll get along in any hotel--with\r\ntips, big ones. If you can’t get a room, slip the room clerk a sawbuck.\r\nLiberal handouts to the bellhops, doormen and elevator boys will help\r\nyou get service, also pave the way for the things that hotels aren’t\r\nsupposed to supply, but always do.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limousines_\r\n\r\nWe told you about the smooth con-men who travel in shiny\r\nchauffeur-driven limousines. The cars are easy to obtain. All smart\r\ntravelers rent them wherever they go. They cost $5 an hour, which is\r\nusually cheaper than cabs for any considerable use. They are available\r\nat any hour. The chauffeurs are well-trained and in uniform. The\r\ncars are brand new Cadillacs or Packards, indistinguishable from a\r\nmillionaire’s private car, except that the D.C. license plate begins\r\nwith the letter “L.” Look in the phone book or ask the hotel porter to\r\nget you a car or phone Haines, HObart 8460, ask for James Conley, the\r\nbest driver in town. Minimum tip one dollar an hour, unless you’re a\r\nskunk. In Baltimore, phone Belvedere, LE 8888.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marriage_\r\n\r\nIt’s much cheaper and easier without rice and old shoes here, but you\r\nwill always find a few old-fashioned people who like it the hard way.\r\nIf you are one who has to be respectable, we will give you the lowdown\r\non how to go about it in the area.\r\n\r\n(_Note_: Common law marriages are valid in the District. They are not\r\nin Maryland and Virginia, though the former state, while prohibiting\r\nsuch marriages for its own residents, will recognize as binding any\r\nsuch entered into in the District.)\r\n\r\nThe marriageable ages in the three jurisdictions are 16 for girls and\r\n18 for boys, with parents’ consent; 18 and 21 in D.C. and Maryland,\r\nwithout consent, and 21 and 21 in Virginia. Marriages between first\r\ncousins are permitted in all three.\r\n\r\nMaryland and Virginia forbid marriages between whites and Negroes or\r\nOrientals. Virginia also proscribes American Indians. There are no\r\nracial restrictions in the District.\r\n\r\nMaryland and Virginia require medical certificates before marriage,\r\nbut Washington doesn’t. So, if you flunk your Wassermann, come to the\r\nDistrict. The waiting time between issuance of license and ceremony\r\nis two days in Maryland, four in the District, and none in Virginia.\r\nMaryland requires that all marriages be solemnized by a clergyman,\r\nwhich is pretty prissy for that state, where you can get so much\r\nwithout marrying at all.\r\n\r\nBoth the District and Maryland permit one party of a proposed marriage\r\nto take out a license without the consent or knowledge of the other.\r\nSometimes overly-eager ones take out these licenses (which are\r\npublished) as a means of bringing final pressure on the other person.\r\nRecently a 21-year-old Marine shot himself to death after a minister\r\nrefused to marry him and an unwilling maiden who had not been aware a\r\nlicense was issued.\r\n\r\nWashington men are the choosiest in the country when it comes to\r\npicking wives. The marriage rate is falling yearly. In 1950, 10,729\r\nlicenses were taken out compared to 10,885 the year before and 12,156\r\nin 1948. Meanwhile other cities are reporting increases. These figures\r\nare even worse than they read. Many transients come to wed in the\r\nDistrict, to avoid blood tests elsewhere or to boast they were hitched\r\nin the nation’s capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medical_\r\n\r\nOsteopaths, chiropractors, naturopaths and other such unorthodox\r\nhealers are permitted both in the District and Maryland and are allowed\r\nto precede their names with the honorific “Dr.” Many Washington\r\nresidents from Los Angeles, the Southwest and the moronic regions where\r\nfaith healers, layer-oners-of-hands, herb doctors and other such quacks\r\nare common, are now living in Washington and provide a boom market for\r\nthe irregular curers.\r\n\r\nOne of Washington’s biggest medical problems is V.D., because of\r\nthe shifting, transient nature of the population and the unusual\r\nNegro percentage. Last year, more than 16,000 cases of gonorrhea\r\nwere reported, and 507 new cases of syphilis. Fifteen people died of\r\nunchecked syphilis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Midday Manners_\r\n\r\nBoth as a world capital and as an Eastern city, Washington’s manners\r\nand modes, on paper at least, could be supposed to resemble those\r\nof New York. But it is in a warmer belt and much of its resident\r\npopulation originated in other sections of the country, where habits\r\nare different, so some compromise of customs is common.\r\n\r\nWashington women generally follow the New York style of not wearing\r\nhats. But the men wear lids all year around, even on the hottest days.\r\n\r\nThe women wear suits for daytime in winter and print dresses in summer.\r\nMen wear dark suits in winter, but, because of the deadly heat, don\r\nsuch tropical outfits as Palm Beach, seersucker, crash and linen\r\nin summer. Like most yokels, a sharp crease in the sleeve means a\r\nwell-pressed suit.\r\n\r\nA Washington woman never wears slacks on the street. When you see any\r\ndame so attired, you know she arrived by bus on a sight-seeing jaunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Midnight Manners_\r\n\r\nFew women wear hats at night. Those who do are visitors. Most men\r\nwear dark suits but compromise good taste with god-awful loud ties.\r\nCustomers of the classier rooms, i.e., the hotel grills, are apt to\r\noverdress. You see more people wearing evening clothes than in New\r\nYork, where such frummery is now worn only on occasions when required,\r\nlike a formal ball or the opening of the opera.\r\n\r\nAll restaurants and night clubs, regardless of season, require men to\r\nwear coats, though some of the more popular-priced ones do not demand\r\nties in the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Protocol_\r\n\r\nIf you are a climber, or the wife of a government official, social\r\nprecedence and correct social forms are more important in your life\r\nthan the Sermon on the Mount. When in doubt about whether the governor\r\nof Nevada sits ahead of or in back of the minister of Costa Rica, you\r\nshould consult Mrs. Carolyn Hagner Shaw, Wisconsin 3030.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taxi Talk_\r\n\r\nThe first thing that amazes the visitor is the terrific number of cabs\r\non the streets. There is no limitation by law and, at this writing,\r\nthere are 9,000. Cabs do not have meters, but operate on a zone system,\r\nthe first charge 30 cents anywhere within the zone, or 20 cents a head\r\nfor two or more passengers. They are asking for an extra dime a zone.\r\nThe out-of-towner is always puzzled figuring out how the owner of the\r\ncab gets a fair shake from the driver, with no meter to check up on\r\nhim. It was Congressman Tom Blanton who slipped riders into all bills\r\nto ban meters in the District.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that every hackman is an independent contractor.\r\nHe rents his cab by the day, for which he pays $6, which includes\r\ninsurance, tires and advertising. He buys his own gas and oil, which\r\ncomes to another $3.50 a day. He keeps everything above that outlay.\r\nWhen business is bad, he swallows the loss himself. He can keep the cab\r\n24 hours a day, and he usually drives it home at night and starts out\r\nin the morning in it. Some older cabs are rented for less, as low as\r\n$3.50 a day. These are used by men who hack in their spare time, such\r\nas policemen, chauffeurs, and government employes, who act as cabbies\r\nfor four or five hours a day.\r\n\r\nWashington law not only permits cabbies to double up passengers, but\r\nrequires them to do so. Your taxi will not leave Union Station until\r\nit has a full load going in your direction. When Washington cabs go to\r\nthe airport in Virginia or the suburbs of Maryland, they make a flat\r\nrate. They are not permitted to pick up return passengers outside the\r\nDistrict. Maryland and Virginia cabs which come into Washington must\r\nreturn home empty.\r\n\r\nDespite the huge number of cabs, it is almost impossible to get one\r\nat around five, when the government offices empty, or whenever it\r\nrains. The rates are so cheap, many Washingtonians find it costs\r\nthem only a nickel more to go to their destination by cab than by\r\nbus or street-car. Few locals ever tip. Cab drivers fall all over\r\nout-of-towners.\r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble hailing a cab, the best place to get one is\r\noutside a hotel or a popular restaurant or night spot, for they will be\r\ndriving up to these places with passengers. If you are caught at the\r\nCapitol and can’t get a cab, go over to the Congressional Hotel, across\r\nfrom the House Office Building, where the doorman can usually snag one\r\nfor you. Don’t forget a tip. Our favorite cabbie is Harold Ramsburg, EM\r\n2438, and you can hire him by the hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tipping_\r\n\r\nWhile on that subject, don’t act like a rube, a Southern cracker\r\nor a dope. Most hotel, restaurant and transportation employes are\r\npractically dependent for their livings on gratuities. Ten percent is\r\nno longer enough. Your waiter should get 20 percent, even more in a\r\nhigh class place where each waiter has only a few tables. Don’t forget\r\nthe captains and headwaiters, especially if you want a good table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Traffic Tickets_\r\n\r\nWe always got our parking and speeding tickets killed by Congressmen’s\r\nsecretaries. That is one thing they are good for. Congressmen are\r\nthe rulers of the District; when their secretaries call the District\r\nCommissioners or the Chief of Police, they get a respectful hearing.\r\n\r\nCongressmen, themselves, are immune from arrest when Congress is in\r\nsession. They are provided with special plates over their own license\r\ntags reading “Member, 82nd Congress.” Smart Congressmen seldom use the\r\nspecial plates. They say that when they do, traffic cops always bother\r\nthem, then suddenly pretend they noticed the plates for the first time,\r\nafter which they let the Congressman go, making it appear they are\r\ndoing him a great favor. The next day they show up in his office asking\r\nfor a favor--a promotion, probably.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Transportation_\r\n\r\nYou can get to Washington by train, plane, bus, auto, bike, or merely\r\nhitch-hiking. Train service, while frequent and fast, is generally\r\nlousy. From New York on the Pennsylvania there is only one first-class\r\ntrain, the Congressional Limited, which makes the 226 miles in 215\r\nminutes, but it’s a shell of its old self, when it was all Pullman\r\nand extra fare. The Congressional is one of the few day trains in the\r\ncountry which runs complete cars of drawing rooms. These are always\r\nfull, with lobbyists, officials and their dames, and other heavy\r\ndrinking parties, spending the three and a half hours as pleasantly as\r\npossible. (_Note_: No liquor is served on trains in Pennsylvania on\r\nSundays.)\r\n\r\nThe two best trains from the West are the B & O’s Capital Limited\r\nand the Pennsy’s Liberty Limited from Chicago. The Capital is an\r\nall-Pullman streamliner and carries a through car to Los Angeles, which\r\nconnects with the Santa Fe’s Chief in Chicago.\r\n\r\nRailroad and plane tickets to and from Washington are difficult to\r\nget, especially on key days of the week. Traffic moves to Washington\r\non Sunday nights and Monday and away on weekends, beginning Thursday.\r\nAt those times a little judicious tipping of hotel porters is advised.\r\nRailroad and plane employes are forbidden by law to take gratuities,\r\nbut who’s going to do anything about it if they find a $10 bill neatly\r\nfolded in their breast pockets?\r\n\r\nThe Washington Airport, though in Virginia, is only 15 minutes from the\r\ncenter of town. Baggage is unloaded considerably faster than in other\r\nairports. But the Union Station is a madhouse. Sometimes it takes a\r\nhalf-hour for your bags to get out to the taxi stand, if you can get a\r\nred cap at all. Then there is another wait for a cab going your way to\r\nfill up. (_Note_: The railroad exacts a 25-cent charge for each parcel\r\ncarried by the red cap. He doesn’t keep that. You are expected to tip\r\nhim on top.)\r\n\r\n(_Inside Stuff_: There are special airplane and railroad ticket offices\r\nfor members of Congress in the Capitol Building.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38.

THE INNER CIRCLE\r\n\r\nThese are extracts from a master list of 800 names submitted to the\r\nKefauver Committee of the U.S. Senate by Narcotics Commissioner Harry\r\nJ. Anslinger in June 1950.\r\n\r\nSince this list was compiled by Commissioner Anslinger some of the\r\nsubjects on it changed their addresses--some to a much warmer climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\n\r\n  SAVERIO, Frank, Alias Frank COSTELLO: (International List 310)\r\n    This subject holds the No. 1 position among major criminals in\r\n    the United States today. He is a member of the Grand Council of\r\n    the International Mafia and ranks among the “top ten” of the\r\n    organization. Costello, as he is usually known, controls the\r\n    gambling interests in New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Florida\r\n    and California, collaterally with interests in Colorado and other\r\n    western states. His gigantic coin machine operations which extend\r\n    through many sections of the country have gained him the title\r\n    “The Slot Machine King.” The subject is reputed to be interested\r\n    in all the major criminal activities conducted by the Mafia and\r\n    other organized criminals throughout the United States. He is\r\n    regularly seen in close association with wealthy and influential\r\n    persons and powerful political figures on both state and national\r\n    levels. The political success of candidates sponsored by Costello\r\n    in New York and Louisiana, which have included some of the\r\n    highest officials of both states, are attested facts.\r\n\r\n  DOTO, Joseph A., alias Joe ADONIS: (International List 79) This\r\n    subject is one of the most important figures of the Mafia\r\n    organization in New York City, a member of the Grand Council\r\n    of the International and a powerful leader in the national\r\n    underworld. For several years Doto has controlled gambling\r\n    and other rackets in New York, New Jersey and collaterally in\r\n    the west and Pacific Coast. He is a national figure in the\r\n    organization, beyond question. In addition to his gambling\r\n    interests, Doto long has been known as an important smuggler and\r\n    distributor of narcotics. He maintains a home at 1020 Dearborn\r\n    Road, Palisade Park, Fort Lee, N. J. He travels extensively. He\r\n    is of Italian descent and was born at Passaic, N. J., in 1902.\r\n\r\n  MANGANO, Vincent or Vicente: (International List 211) Subject is\r\n    an important member of the Grand Council of the International as\r\n    well as of the national organization within the United States. He\r\n    is reputed to derive a sizeable commission on all gambling and\r\n    other rackets in which the organization is engaged. He professes\r\n    inability to speak English. Mangano also controls the labor\r\n    unions on the Brooklyn docks and has connections with underworld\r\n    operations along the waterfront engaged in smuggling and\r\n    distribution of narcotics throughout the United States. Subject\r\n    is closely associated with top members of both the international\r\n    and national Mafia organizations. He is of Sicilian descent and\r\n    so far as records reflect was born in New York in 1887. His\r\n    address is 254 President Street, Brooklyn.\r\n\r\n  MANGANO, Philip: (International List 208) Although of less\r\n    importance than his brother, Vincent (above), subject is a highly\r\n    influential member of the Mafia in New York City. He is closely\r\n    associated with leading members of the organization there and\r\n    throughout the United States. He was born in Italy in 1900 and\r\n    became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1925. He\r\n    lives at 1126 Eighty-fourth Street, Brooklyn.\r\n\r\n  PROFACI, Joseph: (International List 274) Subject is a member\r\n    of the Grand Council of the International. Although there is\r\n    much indirect evidence that subject’s criminal activities have\r\n    included smuggling, counterfeiting, extortion, narcotics traffic\r\n    and murder, he has no record of convictions.\r\n\r\n  GENOVESE, Vito: (International List 130) Subject is an important\r\n    member of the Grand Council of the International and is powerful\r\n    in the underworld of New York City and the national tie-up. He is\r\n    associated with virtually all the influential Mafia members in\r\n    New York and with key individuals of the organization throughout\r\n    the United States. He is a notorious gunman and at one time\r\n    was linked with one of the most extensive narcotics operations\r\n    in the country. In 1939 Genovese fled to Italy while sought by\r\n    Kings County, N. Y., authorities in connection with Murder, Inc.\r\n    He was returned to the United States in 1945 and subsequently\r\n    was acquitted of a murder charge by a New York jury. Subject’s\r\n    criminal activities include murder, smuggling, extortion,\r\n    theft and gambling. He lives in an expensive home in Atlantic\r\n    Highlands, N. J.\r\n\r\n  CARFANO Anthony, aka Augie Pisano: (International List 031)\r\n    Subject is a highly important member of the national Mafia and\r\n    is a powerful leader of the underworld in its transcontinental\r\n    connections, as springboarded from Brooklyn and Miami. He has\r\n    been linked actively in the conduct of major drug smuggling\r\n    operations, with horse booking, the race wire and other gambling.\r\n    He was a former partner of Charles (Lucky) Luciano and was a\r\n    close associate of the late Al Capone. Carfano has accumulated\r\n    considerable wealth and lives lavishly. In recent years he has\r\n    been associated closely with Vincent (Jimmy Blue Eyes) Also in\r\n    operation of exclusive gambling establishments in the Miami area.\r\n    These resorts are known to be hangouts for major underworld\r\n    figures of the nation when they are in Florida. His summer home\r\n    is 85 Clayton Avenue, Long Beach, N. Y., but usually he lives in\r\n    various swank hotels in New York and Florida.\r\n\r\n  MORETTI, Quarico, aka Willie MORETTI: (International List 235)\r\n    Subject is an influential member of the Grand Council as well as\r\n    the national organisation and is one of the chief lieutenants to\r\n    Costello. He is the recognized leader of the New Jersey operation\r\n    and is associated with all the heavy rackets. He is considered\r\n    to be a man of substantial wealth. He is of Italian descent but\r\n    probably was born in this country. (Note: Subject is paretic\r\n    and highly unstable, hence his position today is known to be\r\n    precarious because of various ill-advised decisions which have\r\n    been costly to the organization recently.)\r\n\r\n  ANASTASIA, Albert, 842 Ocean Pkwy, Bklyn\r\n\r\n  BARRA, Morris--aka Mickey Mouse--Lorillard Place, Bronx\r\n\r\n  BONANNO, Joe--aka Joe Bananas--114 Jefferson, Bklyn (See Colo.)\r\n\r\n  BONASIRA, Anthony--aka The Chief--1117 83rd, Bklyn (SE202)\r\n\r\n  COPPOLA, Mike, NYC (Int.

He is associated with leading Mafia members and\r\n    other major racketeers throughout the United States. Maceo was\r\n    born in Italy in 1894 and came to the United States at an early\r\n    age. Prior to 1920, he worked as a barber in Galveston, Texas;\r\n    however, during the Prohibition era, he became the leader of\r\n    a group of liquor and narcotic smugglers who operated in that\r\n    vicinity. Following the repeal of prohibition, Sam Maceo and\r\n    his brother, Rosario, continued their drug smuggling activities\r\n    and at the same time “muscled in” on the gambling racket at\r\n    Galveston. Within a reasonable length of time, the Maceos were in\r\n    control of the gambling racket in that area, and as a result of\r\n    their diversified activities they became very wealthy and also\r\n    influential in politics. In 1937, Sam Maceo was reported with 87\r\n    other defendants in our Case File SE-131, involving an extensive\r\n    narcotic smuggling enterprise. However, Maceo was acquitted by a\r\n    jury on this charge. At the present time, the Maceo organization\r\n    has control of all gambling rackets in Galveston which consists\r\n    of dice, roulette, handbooks, policy, bingo, corno games and slot\r\n    machines. They also own several night clubs and bars and two\r\n    hotels in Galveston. Sam Maceo is a naturalized citizen of the\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\n  ANGELICA, Binaggio: This individual is an important member of the\r\n    Mafia Society of Houston, Texas, and is closely associated with\r\n    influential members of the organization throughout Texas, and\r\n    in the states of Louisiana, Missouri, Illinois, New York and\r\n    Florida. He has long been an important narcotic smuggler and\r\n    distributor and on October 20, 1938, was sentenced to ten years\r\n    in prison for violation of the narcotic laws in connection with\r\n    our Case Files Texas-9349 and SE-131. Angelica was formerly\r\n    identified with Mafia activities in Pennsylvania and was arrested\r\n    in Philadelphia in 1932 for “blackhand” extortion. The subject\r\n    was born in Italy and is a naturalized citizen of the U. S. He\r\n    resides at 1906 State Street, Houston, Texas.\r\n\r\n  ATTARDI, Alfonso: This man is an important member of the Mafia\r\n    Society in Houston, Texas. He was a former associate of Nicolo\r\n    Gentile, the former national arbitrator of the organization\r\n    and was associated with other members throughout Texas and in\r\n    the states of Louisiana, New York and Missouri. Attardi was\r\n    co-defendant in our Case File SE-131, NYS-5198 and Texas-9225 and\r\n    on January 10, 1940 was sentenced to 8 years in Federal prison in\r\n    the latter case.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSOURI\r\n\r\n  DI GIOVANNI, Joseph: This man is the head of the Mafia society for\r\n    the state of Missouri, and without question is the most feared\r\n    and influential man in the Kansas City underworld. Di Giovanni,\r\n    who is now one of the wealthiest Italians in Kansas City, came to\r\n    the United States as a poor Sicilian immigrant in 1912. He began\r\n    his career as the leader of a small group of extortionists and\r\n    within a short time was the leader of the Mafia element in Kansas\r\n    City. During the Prohibition era, Di Giovanni and his associates\r\n    controlled the manufacture and distribution of all contraband\r\n    liquor in this area as well as the raw material used therein, and\r\n    in the early thirties, his group organized the narcotic syndicate\r\n    which operated in Kansas City until 1942. At the present time, Di\r\n    Giovanni owns and operates a wholesale liquor business known as\r\n    the Midwest Distributing Co. at 1109 Cherry St., and also owns a\r\n    chain of retail stores known as the Happy Hollow Liquor Stores,\r\n    Inc. He resides at 410 Gladstone Blvd.\r\n\r\n  BALESTRERE, James: This individual is the head of the Mafia Society\r\n    at Kansas City, Mo., and is second in command in the state.\r\n    Balestrere is often referred to as the “Mystery Man” of local\r\n    politics by the _Kansas City Star_ and has been known to exert\r\n    considerable influence in both state and national circles. For\r\n    a number of years, Balestrere was the leader of the North Side\r\n    Democratic club which controlled the entire Italian district as\r\n    well as the greater portion of the northeast section of the city.\r\n    In 1943, Balestrere went into so-called retirement and installed\r\n    an associate, Charles Binaggio, as the club head. On April 5,\r\n    1950, Binaggio was assassinated. During the interim, Balestrere\r\n    and his superior, Joseph Di Giovanni, have directed all matters,\r\n    political and otherwise, from the background.\r\n\r\n  DI GIOVANNI, Peter: This individual occupies a position of great\r\n    importance in the Mafia society at Kansas City, Mo., due to\r\n    the influence of his brother, Joseph, who is state head of\r\n    the organisation. He resides at 502 Campbell St. and was a\r\n    stockholder in the former “Kansas City Narcotics Syndicate.”\r\n\r\n  DE LUCA, Joseph: (Nat. List 102) This man is a very influential\r\n    member of the Mafia Society at Kansas City, and one of the most\r\n    vicious characters in the underworld of that city. He was the\r\n    head of the former “Kansas City Narcotics Syndicate” and during\r\n    the Prohibition era was one of the largest bootleggers in the\r\n    state of Missouri. De Luca resides at 2840 Forest St.\r\n\r\n  GIZZO, Anthony Robert: This subject, usually known as Tony, is\r\n    an influential member of the Mafia and long has been regarded\r\n    as Balestrere’s first lieutenant. He personally looks after\r\n    Balestrere’s business enterprises and is said to have a small\r\n    interest in each. In addition, Gizzo is the owner of one of the\r\n    largest horse books in Kansas City. He is a close associate of\r\n    the Fischetti brothers in Chicago, Joseph Profaci of Brooklyn,\r\n    and Carlos Marcello of New Orleans.
