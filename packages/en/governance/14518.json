JOHN MORLEY, M.P.\r\n\r\nLESSONS OF IRISH HISTORY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\nBY THE RIGHT HON. W.E. GLADSTONE, M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present seems an excellent moment for bringing forward the arguments\r\nin favour of a new policy for Ireland, which are to be found in the\r\narticles contained in this volume.\r\n\r\nWe are realizing the first results of the verdict given at the election\r\nof 1886. And this I interpret as saying that the constituencies were not\r\nthen ready to depart from the lines of policy which, up to last year,\r\nnearly all politicians of both parties in Parliament had laid down for\r\ntheir guidance in Irish affairs.\r\n\r\nWe have had the Session occupied almost wholly with Lord Salisbury's\r\nproposals for strengthening the power of the central Government to\r\nmaintain law and order in Ireland, and for dealing with the most\r\npressing necessities of the Land question in that country.\r\n\r\nIt is well, before the policy of the Government is practically tested,\r\nthat the views of thoughtful men holding different opinions should be\r\nclearly set forth, not in the shape of polemical speeches, but in\r\nmeasured articles which specially appeal to those who have not hitherto\r\njoined the fighting ranks of either side, and who are sure to intervene\r\nwith great force at the next election, when the Irish question is again\r\nsubmitted to the constituencies.\r\n\r\nI feel that I can add little or nothing to the weight of the arguments\r\ncontained in these papers, but I should like to give some reasons why I\r\nearnestly hope that they will receive careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe writers have endeavoured to approach their work with impartiality,\r\nand to free themselves from those prejudices which make it difficult for\r\nEnglishmen to discuss Irish questions in a fresh and independent train\r\nof thought, and realize how widely Irish customs, laws, traditions, and\r\nsentiments differ from our own.\r\n\r\nWe are apt to think that what has worked well here will work well in\r\nIreland; that Irishmen who differ from us are unreasonable; and that\r\ntheir proposals for change must be mistaken. We do not make allowance\r\nfor the soreness of feeling prevailing among men who have long objected\r\nto the system by which Ireland has been governed, and who find that\r\ntheir earnest appeals for reform have been, until recent times,\r\ncontemptuously disregarded by English politicians. Time after time\r\nmoderate counsels have been rejected until too late. Acts of an\r\nexceptional character intended to secure law and order have been very\r\nnumerous, and every one of them has caused fresh irritation; while\r\nremedial measures have been given in a manner which has not won the\r\nsympathy of the people, because they have not been the work of the Irish\r\nthemselves, and have not been prepared in their own way.\r\n\r\nParliament seems during the past Session to have fallen into the same\r\nerror. By the power of an English majority, measures have been passed\r\nwhich are vehemently opposed by the political leaders and the majority\r\nof the Irish nation, and which are only agreeable to a small minority in\r\nIreland. This action can only succeed if the Irish can be persuaded to\r\nrelinquish the national sentiments of Home Rule; and yet this was never\r\nstronger or more vigorous than at the present time. It is supported by\r\nmillions of Irish settled in America and in Australia; and here I would\r\nsay that it has often struck me that the strong feeling of\r\ndissatisfaction, or, I might say, of disaffection, among the Irish is\r\nfed and nurtured by the marked contrast existing between the social\r\ncondition of large numbers of the Irish in the South and West of Ireland\r\nand the views and habits of their numerous relatives in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe social condition of many parts of Ireland is as backward, or perhaps\r\nmore backward, than the condition of the rural population of England at\r\nthe end of last or the beginning of this century. The Irish peasantry\r\nstill live in poor hovels, often in the same room with animals; they\r\nhave few modern comforts; and yet they are in close communication with\r\nthose who live at ease in the cities and farms of the United States.\r\nThey are also imbued with all the advanced political notions of the\r\nAmerican Republic, and are sufficiently educated to read the latest\r\npolitical doctrines in the Press which circulates among them. Their\r\nsocial condition at home is a hundred years behind their state of\r\npolitical and mental culture. They naturally contrast the misery of many\r\nIrish peasants with the position of their relatives in the New World.\r\nThis cannot but embitter their views against English rulers, and\r\nstrengthen their leaning to national sentiments. Their national\r\naspirations have never died out since 1782. They have taken various\r\nforms; but if the movements arising from them have been put down, fresh\r\nmovements have constantly sprung up. The Press has grown into an immense\r\npower, and its influences have all been used to strengthen the zeal for\r\nIrish nationality, while, at the same time, the success of the national\r\nmovements in Italy, Hungary, Greece, and Germany have had the same\r\neffect. Lastly, the sentiment of Home Rule has gained the sympathy of\r\nlarge bodies of electors in the constituencies of Great Britain, and,\r\nunder the circumstances, it is difficult to suppose that, even if the\r\ncountry remains quiet, constitutional agitation will vanish or the Irish\r\nrelinquish their most cherished ambition.\r\n\r\nWe hear, from men who ought to know something of Ireland, that if the\r\nLand question is once settled, and dual ownership practically abolished,\r\nthe tenants will be satisfied, and the movement for Home Rule will no\r\nlonger find active support in Ireland. Without going into the whole of\r\nthis argument, I should like to say two things: first, that I do not\r\nknow how a large scheme of Land Purchase can be carried through\r\nParliament with safety to Imperial interests without establishing, at\r\nthe same time, some strong Irish Government in Dublin to act between the\r\nImperial Government and the tenants of Ireland; and, second, that the\r\nfeeling for Home Rule has a vitality of its own which will survive the\r\nLand question, even if independently settled.\r\n\r\nHome Rule is an expression of national feeling which cannot be\r\nextinguished in Ireland, and the only safe method of dealing with it is\r\nto turn its force and power to the support of an Irish Government\r\nestablished for the management of local Irish affairs. There are those\r\nwho think that this must lead to separation. I cannot believe in this\r\nfear, for I know of no English statesman who looks upon complete\r\nseparation of Ireland from Great Britain as possible. The geographical\r\nposition of Ireland, the social and commercial connection between the\r\ntwo peoples, renders such a thing impossible. The Irish know this, and\r\nthey are not so foolish as to think that they could gain their\r\nindependence by force of arms; but I do not believe that they desire it.\r\nThey are satisfied to obtain the management of their own local affairs\r\nunder the _ægis_ of the flag of England. The papers in this volume show\r\nhow this can be done with due regard to Imperial interests and the\r\nrights of minorities.\r\n\r\nI shall not enlarge on this part of the subject, but I wish to draw\r\nattention to the working of the Irish Government, and the position which\r\nit holds in the country, for it is through its administration that the\r\npolicy of the Cabinet will be carried out. At the outset I feel bound to\r\ndeprecate the exaggerated condemnation which the \"Castle\" receives from\r\nits opponents. It has its defects. Notwithstanding efforts of various\r\nministers to enlarge the circle from which its officials are drawn, it\r\nis still too narrow for the modern development of Irish society, and it\r\nhas from time to time been recruited from partisans without sufficient\r\nregard to the efficiency and requirements of the public service. But, on\r\nthe whole, its members, taken as individuals, can well bear comparison\r\nwith those of other branches of the Civil Service. They are diligent;\r\nthey desire to do their duty with impartiality, and to hold an even\r\nbalance between many opposing interests in Ireland. Whatever party is in\r\noffice, they loyally carry out the policy of their chiefs. They are,\r\nprobably, more plastic to the leadership of the heads of departments\r\nthan members of some English offices, and they are more quickly moved by\r\nthe influences around them. Sometimes they may relapse into an attitude\r\nof indifference and inertness if their chiefs are not active; but, on\r\nthe other hand, they will act with vigour and decision if they are led\r\nby men who know their own minds and desire to be firm in the government\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of the chiefs of the Irish Civil Service, who change\r\naccording to the political party in office, we must not overlook the\r\nlegal officers, who exercise a most powerful influence on Irish\r\nadministration. They consist of the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney and\r\nSolicitor General, and, until 1883, there was also an officer called the\r\nLaw Adviser, who was the maid-of-all-work of Castle administration. In\r\nEngland, those who hold similar legal offices take no part in the daily\r\nadministration of public affairs. The Lord Chancellor, as a member of\r\nthe Cabinet, takes his share in responsibility for the policy of the\r\nGovernment. The law officers are consulted in special cases, and take\r\ntheir part from time to time in debates in the House of Commons. In\r\nIreland, however, the Chancellor is constantly consulted by the\r\nLord-Lieutenant on any difficult matter of administration, and the\r\nAttorney and Solicitor General are in constant communication with the\r\nLord-Lieutenant, if he carries out the daily work of administration, and\r\nwith the Chief and the Under Secretary.\r\n\r\nGovernments differ as to the use they make of these officials. Some\r\nGovernments have endeavoured to confine their work to cases where a mere\r\nlegal opinion has to be obtained; but, when the country is in a\r\ndisturbed state, even these limited references become very frequent, and\r\nquestions of policy as well as of law are often discussed with the law\r\nofficers. It is needless to say that, with their knowledge of Ireland\r\nand the traditions of Castle government (it is rare that all the law\r\nofficers are new to office, and, consequently, they carry on the\r\ntraditions from one Government to another), they often exercise a\r\nparamount influence over the policy of the Irish Government, and\r\npractically control it.\r\n\r\nThey are connected with the closest and most influential order in Irish\r\nsociety--the legal order, consisting of the judges and Bar of Ireland.\r\nThis adds to the general weight of their advice, but it has a special\r\nbearing when cases of legal reform or administration are under\r\nconsideration; it then requires unwonted courage and independence for\r\nthe law officers of the Crown to support changes which the lay members\r\nof the Government deem necessary.\r\n\r\nI have known conspicuous instances of the exercise of these high\r\nqualities by law officers enabling reforms to be carried, but as a rule,\r\nparticularly when the initiative of legal reform is left to them, the\r\nIrish law officers do not care to move against the feeling of the legal\r\nworld in Dublin. The lawyers, like other bodies, oppose the diminution\r\nof offices and honours belonging to them, or of the funds which, in the\r\nway of fees and salaries, are distributed among members of the bar; and\r\nthey become bitterly hostile to any permanent official who is known to\r\nbe a firm legal reformer. It would be impossible for me not to\r\nacknowledge the great service often done to the Government by the able\r\nmen who have filled the law offices, yet I feel that under certain\r\ncircumstances, when their influence has been allowed too strongly to\r\nprevail, it has tended to narrow the views of the Irish Government, and\r\nto keep it within a circle too narrow for the altered circumstances of\r\nmodern life.\r\n\r\nThe chief peculiarity of the Irish Administration is its extreme\r\ncentralization. In this two departments may be mentioned as typical of\r\nthe whole--the police and administration of local justice.\r\n\r\nThe police in Dublin and throughout Ireland are under the control of the\r\nLord-Lieutenant, and both these forces are admirable of their kind. They\r\nare almost wholly maintained by Imperial funds. The Dublin force costs\r\nabout £150,000 a year. The Royal Irish Constabulary costs over a million\r\nin quiet, and a million and a half in disturbed times. Local authorities\r\nhave nothing to do with their action or management. Local justice is\r\nadministered by unpaid magistrates as in England, but they have been\r\nassisted, and gradually are being supplanted, by magistrates appointed\r\nby the Lord-Lieutenant and paid by the State.\r\n\r\nThis state of things arose many years ago from the want of confidence\r\nbetween resident landlords and the bulk of the people. When agrarian or\r\nreligious differences disturbed a locality the people distrusted the\r\nlocal magistrates, and by degrees the system of stipendiary, or, as they\r\nare called, resident magistrates, spread over the country. To maintain\r\nthe judicial independence and impartiality of these magistrates is of\r\nthe highest importance. At one time this was in some danger, for the\r\nresident magistrates not only heard cases at petty sessions, but, as\r\nexecutive peace officers, to a very great extent took the control of the\r\npolice in their district, not only at riots, but in following up and\r\ndiscovering offenders. Their position as judicial and executive officers\r\nwas thus very unfortunately mixed up. Between 1882 and 1883 the Irish\r\nGovernment did their utmost to separate and distinguish between these\r\ntwo functions, and it is to be hoped that the same policy has been and\r\nwill be now continued, otherwise grave mischief in the administration of\r\njustice will arise. The existence of this staff of stipendiary\r\nmagistrates could not fail to weaken the influence of the gentry in\r\nlocal affairs, and, at the same time, other causes were at work to\r\nundermine still further their power. The spread of education, the\r\nballot, the extension of the franchise, communication with America, all\r\ntended to strengthen the political leaning of the tenants towards the\r\nNational party in Ireland, and to widen the political differences\r\nbetween the richer and poorer classes in the country. The result of this\r\nhas been, that not only have even the best landlords gradually lost\r\ntheir power in Parliamentary elections and on elective boards, but the\r\nGovernment, which greatly relied on them for support, has become\r\nisolated.\r\n\r\nThe system of centralization is felt all over the country. It was the\r\ncause of weakness in the disturbed years of 1880 and 1881, and, although\r\nthe Irish Executive strengthened themselves by placing officers over\r\nseveral counties, on whom they devolved a great deal of responsibility,\r\nthey did not by these steps meet the real difficulty, which was that\r\neverything that went wrong, whether as to police or magisterial\r\ndecisions, was attributed to the management of the Castle.\r\n\r\nIn this country, local authorities and benches of magistrates, quite\r\nindependent of the Home Office, are held responsible for mistakes in\r\npolice action or irregularities in local justice. The consequence is\r\nthat there is a strong buffer to protect the character and power of the\r\nHome Office.\r\n\r\nThe absence of such protection in Ireland obviously has a very\r\nprejudicial effect on the permanent influence and popularity of the\r\nIrish Government. But as long as our system of government from England\r\nexists, this centralization cannot be avoided, for it would not be\r\npossible to transfer the responsibility of the police to local\r\nrepresentative bodies, as they are too much opposed to the landlords and\r\nthe Government to be trusted when strong party differences arise; nor,\r\nfor the same reason, would it be possible to fall back on local men to\r\nadminister justice. The fact is, that, out of the Protestant part of\r\nUlster, the Irish Government receives the cordial support of only the\r\nlanded proprietors, and a part of the upper middle classes in the towns.\r\nThe feeling of the mass of the people has been so long against them that\r\nno change in the direction of trust in any centralized government of\r\nanti-national character can be expected.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to find any Municipal\r\nCouncil, Boards of Guardians, or Local Boards, in Leinster, Munster, or\r\nConnaught, whose members do not consist of a majority of Nationalists.\r\nAt nearly all such assemblies, whenever any important political movement\r\ntakes place in the country, or when the Irish Government take any action\r\nwhich is displeasing to the Nationalists, resolutions are discussed and\r\ncarried in a spirit of sharp hostility to the Government.\r\n\r\nIn Parliamentary elections we also find clear evidence of the strength\r\nof the Nationalists, and the extreme weakness of their opponents. This\r\nis a test which those who accept popular representative government\r\ncannot disregard, particularly at an election when for the first time\r\nthe new constituencies were called upon to exercise the privileges\r\nentrusted to them by Parliament. Such was the election of 1885, followed\r\nin 1886 by another General Election. In 1885 contests took place in most\r\nof the Irish constituencies. They were between Liberals allied with\r\nConservatives, and Parnellites. In 1886 the contests were between those\r\nwho called themselves Unionists and Parnellites, and the Irish policy of\r\nMr. Gladstone was specially referred to the electors.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the number of members returned on the two sides, the result\r\nof each election was almost identical, but in 1886 there were fewer\r\ncontests. We may, then, assume that the relative forces of Parnellites\r\nand Unionists were accurately represented at the election of 1885. If we\r\ntake the votes at the election of 1885 for candidates standing as\r\nNationalists, we shall find, roughly speaking, that they obtained in\r\nround numbers about 300,000 votes, and candidates who stood either as\r\nLiberals or Conservatives about 143,000. But the case is really stronger\r\nthan these figures represent it, because in some constituencies the\r\ncontests were between Liberals and Conservatives, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that in those constituencies a number of Nationalist votes were\r\ngiven for one or both of such candidates--votes which, therefore, would\r\nhave to be deducted from the 143,000, leaving a still heavier majority\r\non the Nationalist side.[1]\r\n\r\nIf we look at individual constituencies, we find that in South Kerry\r\nonly 133 persons voted for the \"Unionist\" candidate, while 2742 voted\r\nfor the Nationalist. In six out of seven constituencies in Cork where\r\ncontests took place 27,692 votes were given for the Nationalists, and\r\nonly 1703 for their opponents. In Dublin, in the division which may be\r\nconsidered the West End constituency of the Irish metropolis, the most\r\nsuccessful man of commerce in Ireland, a leader of society, whose\r\nliberality towards those in his employment is only equalled by his\r\nmunificence in all public works, was defeated by over 1900 votes. He did\r\nnot stand in 1886, but his successor was defeated by a still larger\r\nmajority. These elections show the numbers in Ireland on which the\r\nGovernment and those who oppose Mr. Parnell's policy can count for\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIt is absurd to say that these results are caused by terrorism exercised\r\nover the minds of the electors by the agitators in Ireland; the same\r\nresults occurred in every part of three provinces, and in part of\r\nUlster, and the universality of the feeling proves the dominant feeling\r\nof the Irish electors. They show the extreme difficulty, the\r\nimpossibility, of gaining that support and confidence which a Government\r\nneeds in a free country. As it is, the Irish Government stands isolated\r\nin Ireland, and relies for support solely on England. Is a policy\r\nopposed to national feeling, which has been often, and by different\r\nMinisters, tried in Ireland, likely to succeed in the hands of a\r\nGovernment such as I have described, and isolated, as I think few will\r\ndeny it to be? It is impossible in the long run to maintain it. The\r\nroots of strength are wanting.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from Dublin to London, we do not find greater prospects of\r\nsuccess. Twice within fourteen months Lord Salisbury has formed a\r\nGovernment. In 1885 his Cabinet, on taking office, deliberately decided\r\nto rule Ireland without exceptional laws; after a few months, they\r\nannounced that they must ask Parliament for fresh powers. They resigned\r\nbefore they had defined their measures. But within six months Lord\r\nSalisbury was once more Prime Minister, and again commenced his\r\nadministration by governing Ireland under the ordinary law. This attempt\r\ndid not continue longer than the first, for when Parliament met in 1887,\r\npreparations were at once made to carry the Criminal Law Amendment Act,\r\nwhich occupied so large a portion of the late Session.\r\n\r\nThis is not the action of men who have strong faith in their principles.\r\nNor can it be shown that the continuous support so necessary for success\r\nwill be given to this policy. No doubt it may be urged that the\r\noperation of the Act is not limited in duration; but, notwithstanding\r\nthat, few politicians believe that the constituencies of Great Britain\r\nwill long support the application of exceptional criminal laws to any\r\npart of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis would be wholly inconsistent with past experience In relation to\r\nthese measures, which points entirely the other way; and the publication\r\nin English newspapers and constant discussion on English platforms of\r\nthe painful incidents which seem, unfortunately, inseparable from a\r\nrigid administration of the law in Ireland, together with the prolonged\r\ndebates, such incidents give rise to, in Parliament, aggravate the\r\ndifficulties of administration, and lead the Irish people to believe\r\nthat exceptional legislation will be as short-lived in the future as it\r\nhas been in the past.\r\n\r\nIt was this evidence of want of continuity of policy in 1885, and the\r\nstartling disclosure of the weakness of the anti-national party in\r\nIreland at the election in the autumn of that year, which finally\r\nconvinced me that the time had come when we could no longer turn to a\r\nmixed policy of remedial and exceptional criminal legislation as the\r\nmeans of winning the constituencies of that country in support of our\r\nold system of governing Ireland. That system has failed for eighty-six\r\nyears, and obviously cannot succeed when worked with representative\r\ninstitutions. As the people of Great Britain will not for a moment\r\ntolerate the withdrawal of representative government from Ireland, we\r\nmust adopt some new plan. What I have here written deals with but a\r\nfragment of the arguments for Home Rule, some of which are admirably set\r\nforth by the able men who have written the articles to which this is the\r\npreface. I earnestly wish that they may arrest the attention of many\r\nexcellent Irishmen who still cling to the old traditions of English\r\nrule, and cause them to realize that the only way of relieving their\r\ncountry from the intolerable uncertainty which hangs over her\r\ncommercial, social, and political interests and paralyzes all efforts\r\nfor the improvement of her people, will be to form a Constitution\r\nsupported by all classes of the community. I trust that they will join\r\nin this work before it is too late, for they may yet exercise a powerful\r\nand salutary influence in the settlement of this great question.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There was one case--North Louth--in which two Nationalists\r\nopposed one another, and I have left that case out of the calculation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN HOME RULE\r\n\r\nBY E.L. GODKIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican experience has been frequently cited, in the course of the\r\ncontroversy now raging in England over the Irish question, both by way\r\nof warning and of example. For instance, I have found in the _Times_ as\r\nwell as in other journals--the _Spectator_, I think, among the\r\nnumber--very contemptuous dismissals of the plan of offering Ireland a\r\ngovernment like that of an American State, on the ground that the\r\nAmericans are loyal to the central authority, while in Ireland there is\r\na strong feeling of hostility to it, which would probably increase under\r\nHome Rule. The Queen's writ, it has been remarked, cannot be said to run\r\nin large parts of Ireland, while in every part of the United States the\r\nFederal writ is implicitly obeyed, and the ministers of Federal\r\nauthority find ready aid and sympathy from the people. If I remember\r\nrightly, the Duke of Argyll has been very emphatic in pointing out the\r\ndifference between giving local self-government to a community in which\r\nthe tendencies of popular feeling are \"centrifugal,\" and giving it to\r\none in which these tendencies are \"centripetal.\" The inference to be\r\ndrawn was, of course, that as long as Ireland disliked the Imperial\r\ngovernment the concession of Home Rule would be unsafe, and would only\r\nbecome safe when the Irish people showed somewhat the same sort of\r\naffection for the English connection which the people of the State of\r\nNew York now feel for the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nAmong the multitude of those who have taken part in the controversy on\r\none side or the other, no one has, so far as I have observed, pointed\r\nout that the state of feeling in America toward the central government\r\nwith which the state of feeling in Ireland towards the British\r\nGovernment is now compared, did not exist when the American Constitution\r\nwas set up; that the political tendencies in America at that time were\r\ncentrifugal, not centripetal, and that the extraordinary love and\r\nadmiration with which Americans now regard the Federal government are\r\nthe result of eighty years' experience of its working. The first\r\nConfederation was as much as the people could bear in the way of\r\nsurrendering local powers when the War of Independence came to an end.\r\nIt was its hopeless failure to provide peace and security which led to\r\nthe framing of the present Constitution. But even with this experience\r\nstill fresh, the adoption of the Constitution was no easy matter. I\r\nshall not burden this article with historical citations showing the very\r\ngreat difficulty which the framers of the Constitution had in inducing\r\nthe various States to adopt it, or the magnitude and variety of the\r\nfears and suspicions with which, many of the most influential men in all\r\nparts of the country regarded it. Any one who wishes to know how\r\nnumerous and diversified these fears and suspicions were, cannot do\r\nbetter than read the series of papers known as \"The Federalist,\" written\r\nmainly by Hamilton and Madison, to commend the new plan to the various\r\nStates. It was adopted almost as a matter of necessity, that is, as the\r\nonly way out of the Slough of Despond in which the Confederation had\r\nplunged the union of the States; but the objections to it which were\r\nfelt at the beginning were only removed by actual trial. Hamilton's two\r\ncolleagues, as delegates from New York, Yates and Lansing, withdrew in\r\ndisgust from the Convention, as soon as the Constitution was outlined,\r\nand did not return. The notion that the Constitution was produced by the\r\ncraving of the American people for something of that sort to love and\r\nrevere, and that it was not bestowed on them until they had given ample\r\nassurance that they would lavish affection on it, has no foundation\r\nwhatever in fact. The devotion of Americans to the Union is, indeed, as\r\nclear a case of cause and effect as is to be found in political history.\r\nThey have learned to like the Constitution because the country has\r\nprospered under it, and because it has given them all the benefits of\r\nnational life without interference with local liberties. If they had not\r\nset up a central government until the centrifugal sentiment had\r\ndisappeared from the States, and the feeling of loyalty for a central\r\nauthority had fully shown itself, they would assuredly never have set it\r\nup at all.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it has to be borne in mind that the adoption of the\r\nConstitution did not involve the surrender of any local franchises, by\r\nwhich the people of the various States set great store. The States\r\npreserved fully four-fifths of their autonomy, or in fact nearly all of\r\nit which closely concerned the daily lives of individuals. Set aside the\r\npost-office, and a citizen of the State of New York, not engaged in\r\nforeign trade, might, down to the outbreak of the Civil War, have passed\r\na long and busy life without once coming in contact with a United States\r\nofficial, and without being made aware in any of his doings, by any\r\nrestriction or regulation, that he was living under any government but\r\nthat of his own State. If he went abroad he had to apply for a United\r\nStates passport. If he quarrelled with a foreigner, or with the citizen\r\nof another State, he might be sued in the Federal Court. If he imported\r\nforeign goods he had to pay duties to the collector of a Federal\r\nCustom-house. If he invented something, or wrote a book, he had to\r\napply to the Department of the Interior for a patent or a copyright. But\r\nhow few there were in the first seventy years of American history who\r\nhad any of these experiences! No one supposes, or has ever supposed,\r\nthat had the Federalists demanded any very large sacrifice of local\r\nfranchises, or attempted to set up even a close approach to a\r\ncentralized Government, the adoption of the Constitution would have been\r\npossible. If, for instance, such a transfer of both administration and\r\nlegislation to the central authority as took place in Ireland after the\r\nUnion had been proposed, it would have been rejected with derision. You\r\nwill get no American to argue with you on this point. If you ask him\r\nwhether he thinks it likely that a highly centralized government could\r\nhave been created in 1879--such a one, for example, as Ireland has been\r\nunder since 1800--or whether if created it would by this time have won\r\nthe affection of the people, or filled them with centripetal tendencies,\r\nhe will answer you with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that nowhere, any more than in Ireland, do people love\r\ntheir Government from a sense of duty or because they crave an object of\r\npolitical affection, or even because it exalts them in the eyes of\r\nforeigners. They love it because they are happy or prosperous under it;\r\nbecause it supplies security in the form best suited to their tastes and\r\nhabits, or in some manner ministers to their self-love. Loyalty to the\r\nking as the Lord's anointed, without any sense either of favours\r\nreceived or expected, has played a great part in European politics, I\r\nadmit; but, for reasons which I will not here take up space in stating,\r\na political arrangement, whether it be an elected monarch or a\r\nconstitution, cannot be made, in our day, to reign in men's hearts\r\nexcept as the result of benefits so palpable that common people, as well\r\nas political philosophers, can see them and count them.\r\n\r\nMany of the opponents of Home Rule, too, point to the vigour with which\r\nthe United States Government put down the attempt made by the South to\r\nbreak up the Union as an example of the American love of \"imperial\r\nunity,\" and of the spirit in which England should now meet the Irish\r\ndemands for local autonomy. This again is rather surprising, because you\r\nwill find no one in America who will maintain for one moment that troops\r\ncould have been raised in 1860 to undertake the conquest of the South\r\nfor the purpose of setting up a centralized administration, or, in other\r\nwords, for the purpose of wiping out State lines, or diminishing State\r\nauthority. No man or party proposed anything of this kind at the\r\noutbreak of the war, or would have dared to propose it. The object for\r\nwhich the North rose in arms, and which Lincoln had in view when he\r\ncalled for troops, was the restoration of the Union just as it was when\r\nSouth Carolina seceded, barring the extension of slavery into the\r\nterritories. During the first year of the war, certainly, the revolted\r\nStates might at any time have had peace on the _status quo_ basis, that\r\nis, without the smallest diminution of their rights and immunities under\r\nthe Constitution. It was only when it became evident that the war would\r\nhave to be fought out to a finish, as the pugilists say--that is, that\r\nit would have to end in a complete conquest of the Southern\r\nterritory--that the question, what would become of the States as a\r\npolitical organization after the struggle was over, began to be debated\r\nat all. What did become of them? How did Americans deal with Home Rule,\r\nafter it had been used to set on foot against the central authority what\r\nthe newspapers used to delight in calling \"the greatest rebellion the\r\nworld ever saw\"? The answer to these questions is, it seems to me, a\r\ncontribution of some value to the discussion of the Irish problem in its\r\npresent stage, if American precedents can throw any light whatever on\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere was a Joint Committee of both Houses of Congress appointed in\r\n1866 to consider the condition of the South with reference to the safety\r\nor expediency of admitting the States lately in rebellion to their old\r\nrelations to the Union, including representation in Congress. It\r\ncontained, besides such fanatical enemies of the South as Thaddeus\r\nStevens, such very conservative men as Mr. Fessenden, Mr. Grimes, Mr.\r\nMorrill, and Mr. Conkling. Here is the account they gave of the\r\ncondition of Southern feeling one year after Lee's surrender:--\r\n\r\n\"Examining the evidence taken by your committee still further, in\r\nconnection with facts too notorious to be disputed, it appears that the\r\nSouthern press, with few exceptions, and those mostly of newspapers\r\nrecently established by Northern men, abounds with weekly and daily\r\nabuse of the institutions and people of the loyal States; defends the\r\nmen who led, and the principles which incited, the rebellion; denounces\r\nand reviles Southern men who adhered to the Union; and strives\r\nconstantly and unscrupulously, by every means in its power, to keep\r\nalive the fire of hate and discord between the sections; calling upon\r\nthe President to violate his oath of office, overturn the Government by\r\nforce of arms, and drive the representatives of the people from their\r\nseats in Congress. The national banner is openly insulted, and the\r\nnational airs scoffed at, not only by an ignorant populace, but at\r\npublic meetings, and once, among other notable instances, at a dinner\r\ngiven in honour of a notorious rebel who had violated his oath and\r\nabandoned his flag. The same individual is elected to an important\r\noffice in the leading city of his State, although an unpardoned rebel,\r\nand so offensive that the President refuses to allow him to enter upon\r\nhis official duties. In another State the leading general of the rebel\r\narmies is openly nominated for Governor by the Speaker of the House of\r\nDelegates, and the nomination is hailed by the people with shouts of\r\nsatisfaction, and openly endorsed by the press....\r\n\r\n\"The evidence of an intense hostility to the Federal Union, and an\r\nequally intense love of the late Confederacy, nurtured by the war is\r\ndecisive. While it appears that nearly all are willing to submit, at\r\nleast for the time being, to the Federal authority, it is equally clear\r\nthat the ruling motive is a desire to obtain the advantages which will\r\nbe derived from a representation in Congress. Officers of the Union army\r\non duty, and Northern men who go south to engage in business, are\r\ngenerally detested and proscribed. Southern men who adhered to the Union\r\nare bitterly hated and relentlessly persecuted. In some localities\r\nprosecutions have been instituted in State courts against Union officers\r\nfor acts done in the line of official duty, and similar prosecutions are\r\nthreatened elsewhere as soon as the United States troops are removed.\r\nAll such demonstrations show a state of feeling against which it is\r\nunmistakably necessary to guard.\r\n\r\n\"The testimony is conclusive that after the collapse of the Confederacy\r\nthe feeling of the people of the rebellious States was that of abject\r\nsubmission. Having appealed to the tribunal of arms, they had no hope\r\nexcept that by the magnanimity of their conquerors, their lives, and\r\npossibly their property, might be preserved. Unfortunately the general\r\nissue of pardons to persons who had been prominent in the rebellion, and\r\nthe feeling of kindliness and conciliation manifested by the Executive,\r\nand very generally indicated through the Northern press, had the effect\r\nto render whole communities forgetful of the crime they had committed,\r\ndefiant towards the Federal Government, and regardless of their duties\r\nas citizens. The conciliatory measures of the Government do not seem to\r\nhave been met even half-way. The bitterness and defiance exhibited\r\ntowards the United States under such circumstances is without a parallel\r\nin the history of the world. In return for our leniency we receive only\r\nan insulting denial of our authority. In return for our kind desire for\r\nthe resumption of fraternal relations we receive only an insolent\r\nassumption of rights and privileges long since forfeited. The crime we\r\nhave punished is paraded as a virtue, and the principles of republican\r\ngovernment which we have vindicated at so terrible a cost are denounced\r\nas unjust and oppressive.\r\n\r\n\"If we add to this evidence the fact that, although peace has been\r\ndeclared by the President, he has not, to this day, deemed it safe to\r\nrestore the writ of _habeas corpus_, to relieve the insurrectionary\r\nStates of martial law, nor to withdraw the troops from many localities,\r\nand that the commanding general deems an increase of the army\r\nindispensable to the preservation of order and the protection of loyal\r\nand well-disposed people in the South, the proof of a condition of\r\nfeeling hostile to the Union and dangerous to the Government throughout\r\nthe insurrectionary States would seem to be overwhelming.\"\r\n\r\nThis Committee recommended a series of coercive measures, the first of\r\nwhich was the adoption of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution,\r\nwhich disqualified for all office, either under the United States or\r\nunder any State, any person who having in any capacity taken an oath of\r\nallegiance to the United States afterwards engaged in rebellion or gave\r\naid and comfort to the rebels. This denied the _jus honorum_ to all the\r\nleading men at the South who had survived the war. In addition to it, an\r\nAct was passed in March, 1867, which put all the rebel States under\r\nmilitary rule until a constitution should have been framed by a\r\nConvention elected by all males over twenty-one, except such as would be\r\nexcluded from office by the above-named constitutional amendment if it\r\nwere adopted, which at that time it had not been. Another Act was passed\r\nthree weeks later, prescribing, for voters in the States lately in\r\nrebellion, what was known as the \"ironclad oath,\" which excluded from\r\nthe franchise not only all who had borne arms against the United States,\r\nbut all who, having ever held any office for which the taking an oath of\r\nallegiance to the United States was a qualification, had afterwards ever\r\ngiven \"aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\" This practically\r\ndisfranchised all the white men of the South over twenty-five years old.\r\n\r\nOn this legislation there grew up, as all the world now knows, what was\r\ncalled the \"carpet-bag\" _regime_. Swarms of Northern adventurers went\r\ndown to the Southern States, organized the ignorant negro voters,\r\nconstructed State constitutions to suit themselves, got themselves\r\nelected to all the chief offices, plundered the State treasuries,\r\ncontracted huge State debts, and stole the proceeds in connivance with\r\nlegislatures composed mainly of negroes, of whom the most intelligent\r\nand instructed had been barbers and hotel-waiters. In some of the\r\nStates, such as South Carolina and Mississippi, in which the negro\r\npopulation were in the majority, the government became a mere\r\ncaricature. I was in Columbia, the capital of South Carolina, in 1872,\r\nduring the session of the legislature, when you could obtain the passage\r\nof almost any measure you pleased by a small payment--at that time seven\r\nhundred dollars--to an old negro preacher who controlled the coloured\r\nmajority. Under the pretence of fitting up committee-rooms, the private\r\nlodging-rooms at the boarding-houses of the negro members, in many\r\ninstances, were extravagantly furnished with Wilton and Brussels\r\ncarpets, mirrors, and sofas. A thousand dollars were expended for two\r\nhundred elegant imported china spittoons. There were only one hundred\r\nand twenty-three members in the House of Representatives, but the\r\nresidue were, perhaps, transferred to the private chambers of the\r\nlegislators.\r\n\r\nNow, how did the Southern whites deal with this state of things? Well, I\r\nam sorry to say they manifested their discontent very much in the way\r\nin which the Irish have for the last hundred years been manifesting\r\ntheirs. If, as the English opponents of Home Rule seem to think,\r\nreadiness to commit outrages, and refusal to sympathize with the victims\r\nof outrages, indicate political incapacity, the whites of the South\r\nshowed, in the period between 1866 and 1876, that they were utterly\r\nunfit to be entrusted with the work of self-government. They could not\r\nrise openly in revolt because the United States troops were everywhere\r\nat the service of the carpet-baggers, for the suppression of armed\r\nresistance. They did not send petitions to Congress, or write letters to\r\nthe Northern newspapers, or hold indignation meetings. They simply\r\nformed a huge secret society on the model of the \"Molly Maguires\" or\r\n\"Moonlighters,\" whose special function was to intimidate, flog,\r\nmutilate, or murder political opponents in the night time. This society\r\nwas called the \"Ku-Klux Klan.\" Let me give some account of its\r\noperation, and I shall make it as brief as possible. It had become so\r\npowerful in 1871 that President Grant in that year, in his message to\r\nCongress, declared that \"a condition of things existed in some of the\r\nStates of the Union rendering life and property insecure, and the\r\ncarrying of the mails and the collecting of the revenue dangerous.\" A\r\nJoint Select Committee of Congress was accordingly appointed, early in\r\n1872, to \"inquire into the condition of affairs in the late\r\ninsurrectionary States, so far as regards the execution of the laws and\r\nthe safety of the lives and property of the citizens of the United\r\nStates.\" Its report now lies before me, and it reads uncommonly like the\r\nspeech of an Irish Secretary in the House of Commons bringing in a\r\n\"Suppression of Crime Bill.\" The Committee say--\r\n\r\n\"There is a remarkable concurrence of testimony to the effect that, in\r\nthose of the late rebellious States into whose condition we have\r\nexamined, the courts and juries administer justice between man and man\r\nin all ordinary cases, civil and criminal; and while there is this\r\nconcurrence on this point, the evidence is equally decisive that redress\r\ncannot be obtained against those who commit crimes in disguise and at\r\nnight. The reasons assigned are that identification is difficult, almost\r\nimpossible; that, when this is attempted, the combinations and oaths of\r\nthe order come in and release the culprit by perjury, either upon the\r\nwitness-stand or in the jury-box; and that the terror inspired by their\r\nacts, as well as the public sentiment in their favour in many\r\nlocalities, paralyzes the arm of civil power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The murders and outrages which have been perpetrated in many counties\r\nof Middle and West Tennessee, during the past few months, have been so\r\nnumerous, and of such an aggravated character, as almost baffles\r\ninvestigation. In these counties a reign of terror exists which is so\r\nabsolute in its nature that the best of citizens are unable or unwilling\r\nto give free expression to their opinions. The terror inspired by the\r\nsecret organization known as the Ku-Klux Klan is so great, that the\r\nofficers of the law are powerless to execute its provisions, to\r\ndischarge their duties, or to bring the guilty perpetrators of these\r\noutrages to the punishment they deserve. Their stealthy movements are\r\ngenerally made under cover of night, and under masks and disguises,\r\nwhich render their identification difficult, if not impossible. To add\r\nto the secrecy which envelops their operations, is the fact that no\r\ninformation of their murderous acts can be obtained without the greatest\r\ndifficulty and danger in the localities where they are committed. No one\r\ndares to inform upon them, or take any measures to bring them to\r\npunishment, because no one can tell but that he may be the next victim\r\nof their hostility or animosity. The members of this organization, with\r\ntheir friends, aiders, and abettors, take especial pains to conceal all\r\ntheir operations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Your committee believe that during the past six months, the murders--to\r\nsay nothing of other outrages--would average one a day, or one for every\r\ntwenty-four hours; that in the great majority of these cases they have\r\nbeen perpetrated by the Ku-Klux above referred to, and few, if any, have\r\nbeen brought to punishment. A number of the counties of this State\r\n(Tennessee) are entirely at the mercy of this organization, and roving\r\nbands of nightly marauders bid defiance to the civil authorities, and\r\nthreaten to drive out every man, white or black, who does not submit to\r\ntheir arbitrary dictation. To add to the general lawlessness of these\r\ncommunities, bad men of every description take advantage of the\r\ncircumstances surrounding them, and perpetrate acts of violence, from\r\npersonal or pecuniary motives, under the plea of political necessity.\"\r\n\r\nHere is some of the evidence on which the report was based.\r\n\r\nA complaint of outrages committed in Georgia was referred by the general\r\nof the army, in June, 1869, to the general of the Department of the\r\nSouth for thorough investigation and report. General Terry, in his\r\nreport, made August 14, 1869, says[2]--\r\n\r\n\"In many parts of the State there is practically no government. The\r\nworst of crimes are committed, and no attempt is made to punish those\r\nwho commit them. Murders have been and are frequent; the abuse, in\r\nvarious ways, of the blacks is too common to excite notice. There can be\r\nno doubt of the existence of numerous insurrectionary organizations\r\nknown as 'Ku-Klux Klans,' who, shielded by their disguise, by the\r\nsecrecy of their movements, and by the terror which they inspire,\r\nperpetrate crime with impunity. There is great reason to believe that in\r\nsome cases local magistrates are in sympathy with the members of these\r\norganizations. In many places they are overawed by them and dare not\r\nattempt to punish them. To punish such offenders by civil proceedings\r\nwould be a difficult task, even were magistrates in all cases disposed\r\nand had they the courage to do their duty, for the same influences which\r\ngovern them equally affect juries and witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Lewis Merrill, who assumed command (in Louisiana) on\r\nthe 26th of March, and commenced investigation into the state of\r\naffairs, says (p. 1465)--\r\n\r\n\"From the best information I can get, I estimate the number of cases of\r\nwhipping, beating, and personal violence of various grades, in this\r\ncounty, since the first of last November, at between three and four\r\nhundred, excluding numerous minor cases of threats, intimidation, abuse,\r\nand small personal violence, as knocking down with a pistol or gun, etc.\r\nThe more serious outrages, exclusive of murders and whippings, noted\r\nhereafter, have been the following:--\"\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds with the details of sixty-eight cases, giving the names\r\nof the parties injured, white and black, and including the tearing up of\r\nthe railway, on the night before a raid was made by the Ku-Klux on the\r\ncounty treasury building. The rails were taken up, to prevent the\r\narrival of the United States troops, who, it was known, were to come on\r\nSunday morning. The raid was made on that Sunday night while the troops\r\nwere lying at Chester, twenty-two miles distant, unable to reach\r\nYorkville, because of the rails being torn up.\r\n\r\nAnother witness said: \"To give the details of the whipping of men to\r\ncompel them to change their mode of voting, the tearing of them away\r\nfrom their families at night, accompanied with insults and outrage, and\r\nfollowed by their murder, would be but repeating what has been described\r\nin other States, showing that it is the same organization in all,\r\nworking by the same means for the same end. Five murders are shown to\r\nhave been committed in Monroe County, fifteen in Noxubee, one in\r\nLowndes, by the testimony taken in the city of Washington; but the\r\nextent to which school-houses were burnt, teachers whipped, and outrages\r\ncommitted in this State, cannot be fully given until the testimony taken\r\nby the sub-committee shall have been printed and made ready to report.\"\r\n\r\nThere are about eighty, closely printed, large octavo pages of this kind\r\nof testimony given by sufferers from the outrages.\r\n\r\nSomething was done to suppress the Ku-Klux by a Federal Act passed in\r\n1871, which made offences of this kind punishable in the Federal Courts.\r\nConsiderable numbers of them were arrested, tried, and convicted, and\r\nsent to undergo their punishment in the Northern jails. But there was no\r\ncomplete pacification of the South until the carpet-bag governments were\r\nrefused the support of the Federal troops by President Hayes, on his\r\naccession to power in 1876. Then the carpet-bag _régime_ disappeared\r\nlike a house of cards. The chief carpet-baggers fled, and the government\r\npassed at once into the hands of the native whites. I do not propose to\r\ndefend or explain the way in which they have since then kept it in their\r\nhands, by suppressing or controlling the negro vote. This is not\r\nnecessary to my purpose.\r\n\r\nWhat I seek to show is that the Irish are not peculiar in their manner\r\nof expressing their discontent with a government directed or controlled\r\nby the public opinion of another indifferent or semi-hostile community\r\nwhich it is impossible to resist in open warfare; that Anglo-Saxons\r\nresort to somewhat the same methods under similar circumstances, and\r\nthat lawlessness and cruelty, considered as expressions of political\r\nanimosity, do not necessarily argue any incapacity for the conduct of an\r\norderly and efficient government, although I admit freely that they do\r\nargue a low state of civilization.\r\n\r\nI will add one more illustration which, although more remote than those\r\nwhich I have taken from the Southern States during the reconstruction\r\nperiod, is not too remote for my purpose, and is in some respects\r\nstronger than any of them. I do not know a more orderly community in the\r\nworld, or one which, down to the outbreak of the Civil War, when\r\nmanufactures began to multiply, and the Irish immigration began to pour\r\nin, had a higher average of intelligence than the State of Connecticut.\r\nDown to 1818 all voters in that State had to be members of the\r\nCongregational Church. It had no large cities, and this, with the aid of\r\nits seat of learning, Yale College, preserved in it, I think, in greater\r\npurity than even Massachusetts, the old Puritan simplicity of manners,\r\nthe Puritan spirit of order and thrift, and the business-like view of\r\ngovernment which grew out of the practice of town government. A less\r\nsentimental community, I do not think, exists anywhere, or one in which\r\nthe expression of strong feeling on any subject but religion is less\r\ncultivated or viewed with less favour. In the matter of managing their\r\nown political affairs in peace or war, I do not expect the Irish to\r\nequal the Connecticut people for a hundred years to come, no matter how\r\nmuch practice they may have in the interval, and I think that fifty\r\nyears ago it was only picked bodies of Englishmen who could do so. Yet,\r\nin 1833, in the town of Canterbury, one of the most orderly and\r\nintelligent in the State, an estimable and much-esteemed lady, Miss\r\nPrudence Crandall, was carrying on a girls' school, when something\r\nhappened to touch her conscience about the condition of the free negroes\r\nof the North. She resolved, in a moment of enthusiasm, to undertake the\r\neducation of negro girls only. What follows forms one of the most famous\r\nepisodes in the anti-slavery struggle in America, and is possibly\r\nfamiliar to many of the older readers of this article. I shall extract\r\nthe account of it as given briefly in the lately published life of\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, by his sons. Some of the details are much worse\r\nthan is here described.\r\n\r\n\"The story of this remarkable case cannot be pursued here except in\r\nbrief.... It will be enough to say that the struggle between the modest\r\nand heroic young Quaker woman and the town lasted for nearly two years;\r\nthat the school was opened in April; that attempts were immediately made\r\nunder the law to frighten the pupils away and to fine Miss Crandall for\r\nharbouring them; that in May an Act prohibiting private schools for\r\nnon-resident coloured persons, and providing for the expulsion of the\r\nlatter, was procured from the legislature, amid the greatest rejoicing\r\nin Canterbury (even to the ringing of church bells); that, under this\r\nAct, Miss Crandall was in June arrested and temporarily imprisoned in\r\nthe county jail, twice tried (August and October) and convicted; that\r\nher case was carried up to the Supreme Court of Errors, and her\r\npersecutors defeated on a technicality (July, 1834), and that pending\r\nthis litigation the most vindictive and inhuman measures were taken to\r\nisolate the school from the countenance and even the physical support of\r\nthe townspeople. The shops and the meeting-house were closed against\r\nteacher and pupils, carriage in the public conveyances was denied them,\r\nphysicians would not wait upon them, Miss Crandall's own family and\r\nfriends were forbidden, under penalty of heavy fines, to visit her, the\r\nwell was filled with manure and water from other sources refused, the\r\nhouse itself was smeared with filth, assailed with rotten eggs and\r\nstones, and finally set on fire\" (vol. i. p. 321).\r\n\r\nMiss Crandall is still living in the West, in extreme old age, and the\r\nConnecticut legislature voted her a small pension two years ago, as a\r\nslight expiation of the ignominy and injustice from which she had\r\nsuffered at the hands of a past generation.\r\n\r\nThe _Spectator_ frequently refers to the ferocious hatred displayed\r\ntoward the widow of Curtin, the man who was cruelly murdered by\r\nmoonlighters somewhere in Kerry, as an evidence of barbarism which\r\nalmost, if not quite, justifies the denial of self-government to a\r\npeople capable of producing such monsters in one spot and on one\r\noccasion. Let me match this from Mississippi with a case which I\r\nproduce, not because it was singular, but because it was notorious at\r\nthe North, where it occurred, in 1877. One Chisholm, a native of the\r\nState, and a man of good standing and character, became a Republican\r\nafter the war, and was somewhat active in organizing the negro voters in\r\nhis district. He was repeatedly warned by some of his neighbours to\r\ndesist and abandon politics, but continued resolutely on his course. A\r\nmob, composed of many of the leading men in the town, then attacked him\r\nin his house. He made his escape, with his wife and young daughter and\r\nson, a lad of fourteen, to the jail. His assailants broke the jail open,\r\nand killed him and his son, and desperately wounded the daughter. The\r\npoor lad received such a volley of bullets, that his blood went in one\r\nrush to the floor, and traced the outlines of his trunk on the ceiling\r\nof the room below, where it remained months afterwards, an eye-witness\r\ntold me, as an illustration of the callousness of the jailer. The\r\nleading murderers were tried. They had no defence. The facts were not\r\ndisputed. The judge and the bar did their duty, but the jury acquitted\r\nthe prisoners without leaving their seats. Mrs. Chisholm, the widow,\r\nfound neither sympathy nor friends at the scene of the tragedy. She had\r\nto leave the State, and found refuge in Washington, where she now holds\r\na clerkship in the Treasury department.\r\n\r\nLet me cite as another illustration the violent ways in which popular\r\ndiscontent may find expression in communities whose political capacity\r\nand general respect for the law and its officers, as well as for the\r\nsanctity of contracts, have never been questioned. Large tracts of land\r\nwere formerly held along the Hudson river in the State of New York, by a\r\nfew families, of which the Van Rensselaers and the Livingstons were the\r\nchief, either under grants from the Dutch at the first settlement of the\r\ncolony, or from the English Crown after the conquest. That known as the\r\n\"Manor of Rensselaerwick,\" held by the Van Rensselaers, comprised a\r\ntract of country extending twenty-four miles north and south, and\r\nforty-eight miles east and west, lying on each side of the Hudson river.\r\nIt was held by the tenants for perpetual leases. The rents were, on the\r\nVan Rensselaer estate, fourteen bushels of wheat for each hundred acres,\r\nand four fat hens, and one day's service with a carriage and horses, to\r\neach farm of one hundred and sixty acres. Besides this, there was a fine\r\non alienation amounting to about half a year's rent. The Livingston\r\nestates were let in much the same way.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, Stephen Van Rensselaer, the proprietor, or \"Patroon\" as he was\r\ncalled, died, with $400,000 due to him as arrears from the tenants, for\r\nwhich, being a man of easy temper, he had forborne to press them. But he\r\nleft the amount in trust by his will for the payment of his debts, and\r\nhis heirs proceeded to collect it, and persisted in the attempt during\r\nthe ensuing seven years. What then happened I shall describe in the\r\nwords of Mr. John Bigelow. Mr. Tilden was a member of the State\r\nLegislature in 1846, and was appointed Chairman of a Committee to\r\ninvestigate the rent troubles, and make the report which furnished the\r\nbasis for the legislation by which they were subsequently settled. Mr.\r\nBigelow, who has edited Mr. Tilden's _Public Writings and Speeches_,\r\nprefaces the report with the following explanatory note:--\r\n\r\n\"Attempts were made to enforce the collection of these rents. The\r\ntenants resisted. They established armed patrols, and, by the adoption\r\nof various disguises, were enabled successfully to defy the civil\r\nauthorities. Eventually it became necessary to call out the military,\r\nbut the result was only partially satisfactory. These demonstrations of\r\nauthority provoked the formation of 'anti-rent clubs' throughout the\r\nmanorial district, with a view of acquiring a controlling influence in\r\nthe legislature. Small bands, armed and disguised as Indians, were also\r\nformed to hold themselves in readiness at all times to resist the\r\nofficers of the law whenever and wherever they attempted to serve legal\r\nprocess upon the tenants. The principal roads throughout the infected\r\ndistrict were guarded by the bands so carefully, and the animosity\r\nbetween the tenants and the civil authorities was so intense, that at\r\nlast it became dangerous for any one not an anti-renter to be found in\r\nthese neighbourhoods. It was equally dangerous for the landlords to make\r\nany appeal to the law or for the collection of rents or for protection\r\nof their persons. When Governor Wright entered upon his duties in Albany\r\nin 1845, he found that the anti-rent party had a formidable\r\nrepresentation in the legislature, and that the questions involved were\r\nassuming an almost national importance.\"\r\n\r\nThe sheriff made gallant attempts to enforce the law, but his deputies\r\nwere killed, and a legal investigation in which two hundred persons were\r\nexamined, failed to reveal the perpetrators of the crime. The militia\r\nwere called out, but they were no more successful than the sheriff. In\r\nthe case of one murder committed in Delaware County in 1845, however,\r\ntwo persons were convicted, but their sentence was commuted to\r\nimprisonment for life. Various others concerned in the disturbances were\r\nconvicted of minor offences, but when Governor Young succeeded Governor\r\nSeward after an election in which the anti-renters showed considerable\r\nvoting strength, he pardoned them all on the ground that their crimes\r\nwere political. The dispute was finally settled by a compromise--that\r\nis, the Van Rensselaers and the Livingstons both sold their estates,\r\ngiving quit-claim deeds to the tenants for what they chose to pay, and\r\nthe granting of agricultural leases for a longer term than twelve years\r\nwas forbidden by the State Constitution of 1846.\r\n\r\nThis anti-rent agitation is described by Professor Johnston of\r\nPrinceton, in the _Cyclopædia of Political Science_, as \"a reign of\r\nterror which for ten years practically suspended the operations of law\r\nand the payment of rent throughout the district.\" Suppose all the land\r\nof the State had been held under similar tenures; that the controversy\r\nhad lasted one hundred years; that the rents had been high; and that the\r\nVan Rensselaers and the Livingstons had had the aid of the Federal army\r\nin enforcing distraints and evictions, and in enabling them to set local\r\nopinion at defiance, what do you suppose the state of morals and manners\r\nwould have been in New York by this time? What would have been the\r\nfeelings of the people towards the Federal authority had the matter been\r\nfinally adjusted with the strong hand, in accordance, not with the views\r\nof the people of the State, but of the landholders of South Carolina or\r\nof the district of Columbia? I am afraid they would have been terribly\r\nIrish.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know very well the risk I run, in citing all these precedents and\r\nparallels, of seeming to justify, or at all events to palliate, Irish\r\nlawlessness. But I am not doing anything of the kind. I am trying to\r\nillustrate a somewhat trite remark which I recently made: \"that\r\ngovernment is a very practical business, and that those succeed best in\r\nit who bring least sentiment or enthusiasm to the conduct of their\r\naffairs.\" The government of Ireland, like the government of all other\r\ncountries, is a piece of business--a very difficult piece of business, I\r\nadmit--and therefore horror over Irish doings, and the natural and human\r\ndesire to \"get even with\" murderers and moonlighters, by denying the\r\ncommunity which produces them something it would like much to possess,\r\nshould have no influence with those who are charged with Irish\r\ngovernment. It is only in nurseries and kindergartens that we can give\r\noffenders their exact due and withhold their toffee until they have\r\nfurnished satisfactory proofs of repentance. Rulers of men have to\r\noccupy themselves mainly with the question of drying up the sources of\r\ncrime, and often, in order to accomplish this, to let much crime and\r\ndisorder go unwhipped of justice.\r\n\r\nWith the state of mind which cannot bear to see any concessions made to\r\nthe Irish Nationalists because they are such wicked men, in which so\r\nmany excellent Englishmen, whom we used to think genuine political\r\nphilosophers, are now living, we are very familiar in the United States.\r\nIt is a state of mind which prevailed in the Republican party with\r\nregard to the South, down to the election of 1884, and found constant\r\nexpression on the stump and in the newspapers in what is described, in\r\npolitical slang, as \"waving the bloody shirt.\" It showed itself after\r\nthe war in unwillingness to release the South from military rule; then\r\nin unwillingness to remove the disfranchisement of the whites or to\r\nwithdraw from the carpet-bag State governments the military support\r\nwithout which they could not have existed for a day; and, last of all,\r\nin dread of the advent of a Democratic Federal Administration in which\r\nSoutherners or \"ex-rebels\" would be likely to hold office. At first the\r\nwhole Republican party was more or less permeated by these ideas; but\r\nthe number of those who held them gradually diminished, until in 1884 it\r\nwas at last possible to elect a Democratic President. Nevertheless a\r\ngreat multitude witnessed the entrance into the White House of a\r\nPresident who is indebted for his election mainly to the States formerly\r\nin rebellion, with genuine alarm. They feared from it something\r\ndreadful, in the shape either of a violation of the rights of the\r\nfreedmen, or of an assault on the credit and stability of the Federal\r\nGovernment. Nothing but actual experiment would have disabused them.\r\n\r\nI am very familiar with the controversy with them, for I have taken some\r\npart in it ever since the passage of the reconstruction Acts, and I know\r\nvery well how they felt, and am sometimes greatly impressed by the\r\nsimilarity between their arguments and those of the opponents of Irish\r\nHome Rule. One of their fixed beliefs for many years, though it is now\r\nextinct, was that Southerners were so bent on rebelling again, and were\r\ngenerally so prone to rebellion, that the awful consequences of their\r\nlast attempt in the loss of life and property, had made absolutely no\r\nimpression on them. The Southerner was, in fact, in their eyes, what Mr.\r\nGladstone says the Irishman is in the eyes of some Englishmen: \"A _lusus\r\nnaturæ_; that justice, common sense, moderation, national prosperity had\r\nno meaning for him; that all he could appreciate was strife and\r\nperpetual dissension. It was for many years useless to point out to them\r\nthe severity of the lesson taught by the Civil War as to the physical\r\nsuperiority of the North, or the necessity of peace and quiet to enable\r\nthe new generation of Southerners to restore their fortunes, or even\r\ngain a livelihood. Nor was it easy to impress them with the\r\ninconsistency of arguing that it was slavery which made Southerners what\r\nthey were before they went to war, and maintaining at the same time that\r\nthe disappearance of slavery would produce no change in their manners,\r\nideas, or opinions. All this they answered by pointing to speeches\r\ndelivered by some fiery adorer of \"the lost cause,\" to the Ku-Klux\r\noutrages, to political murders, like that of Chisholm, to the building\r\nof monuments to the Confederate dead, or to some newspaper expression of\r\nreverence for Confederate nationality. In fact, for fully ten years\r\nafter the close of the war the collection of Southern \"outrages\" and\r\ntheir display before Northern audiences, was the chief work of\r\nRepublican politicians. In 1876, during the Hayes-Tilden canvass, the\r\nopening speech which furnished what is called \"the key-note of the\r\ncampaign\" was made by Mr. Wheeler, the Republican candidate for the\r\nVice-Presidency, and his advice to the Vermonters, to whom it was\r\ndelivered, was \"to vote as they shot,\" that is, to go to the polls with\r\nthe same feelings and aims as those with which they enlisted in the war.\r\n\r\nI need hardly tell English readers how all this has ended. The\r\nwithdrawal of the Federal troops from the South by President Hayes, and\r\nthe consequent complete restoration of the State governments to the\r\ndiscontented whites, have fully justified the expectations of those who\r\nmaintained that it is no less true in politics than in physics, that if\r\nyou remove what you see to be the cause, the effect will surely\r\ndisappear. It is true, at least in the Western world, that if you give\r\ncommunities in a reasonable degree the management of their own affairs,\r\nthe love of material comfort and prosperity which is now so strong among\r\nall civilized, and even partially civilized men, is sure in the long run\r\nto do the work of creating and maintaining order; or, as Mr. Gladstone\r\nhas expressed it, in setting up a government, \"the best and surest\r\nfoundation we can find to build on is the foundation afforded by the\r\naffections, the convictions, and the will of men.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Report of Secretary of War, 1869-70, vol. i. p. 89.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WE BECAME HOME RULERS.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES BRYCE, M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Home Rule contest of the last eighteen months no argument has\r\nbeen more frequently used against the Liberal party than the charge of\r\nsudden, and therefore, it would seem, dishonest change of view. \"You\r\nwere opposed to an Irish Parliament at the election of 1880 and for some\r\ntime afterward; you are not entitled to advocate it in 1886.\" \"You\r\npassed a Coercion Bill in 1881, your Ministry (though against the\r\nprotests of an active section of its supporters) passed another Coercion\r\nBill in 1882; you have no right to resist a third such Bill in 1887,\r\nand, if you do, your conduct can be due to nothing but party spite and\r\nrevenge at your own exclusion from office.\" Reproaches of this kind are\r\nnow the stock-in-trade, not merely of the ordinary politician, who, for\r\nwant of a case, abuses the plaintiff's attorney, but of leading men,\r\nand, still more, of leading newspapers, who might be thought bound to\r\nproduce from recent events and an examination of the condition of\r\nIreland some better grounds for the passion they display. It is\r\nnoticeable that such reproaches come more often from the so-called\r\nLiberal Unionists than from the present Ministry. Perhaps, with their\r\nbelief that all Liberals are unprincipled revolutionaries, the Tories\r\ndeem a sin more or less to be of small account. Perhaps a recollection\r\nof their own remarkable gyrations, before and after the General\r\nElection of 1885, may suggest that the less said about the past the\r\nbetter for everybody. Be the cause what it may, it is surprising to find\r\nthat a section commanding so much ability as the group of Dissentient\r\nLiberals does, should rely rather on the charge of inconsistency than on\r\nthe advocacy of any counter-policy of their own. It is not large and\r\nelevated, but petty, minds that rejoice to say to an opponent (and all\r\nthe more so if he was once a friend), \"You must either be wrong now, or\r\nhave been wrong then, because you have changed your opinion. I have not\r\nchanged; I was right then, and I am right now.\" Such an argument not\r\nonly dispenses with the necessity of sifting the facts, but it fosters\r\nthe satisfaction of the person who employs it. Consistency is the pet\r\nvirtue of the self-righteous, and the man who values himself on his\r\nconsistency can seldom be induced to see that to shut one's eyes to the\r\nfacts which time develops, to refuse to reconsider one's position by the\r\nlight they shed, to cling to an old solution when the problem is\r\nsubstantially new, is a proof, not of fortitude and wisdom, but rather\r\nof folly and conceit.\r\n\r\nSuch persons may be left to the contemplation of their own virtues. But\r\nthere are many fair-minded men of both political parties, or of neither,\r\nwho, while acquitting those Liberal members who supported Home Rule in\r\n1886 and opposed Coercion in 1887 of the sordid or spiteful motives with\r\nwhich the virulence of journalism credits them, have nevertheless been\r\nsurprised at the apparent swiftness and completeness of the change in\r\ntheir opinions. It would be idle to deny that, in startling the minds of\r\nsteady-going people, this change did, for the moment, weaken the\r\ninfluence and weight of those who had changed. This must be so. A man\r\nwho says now what he denied six years ago cannot expect to be believed\r\non his _ipse dixit_. He must set forth the grounds of his conviction. He\r\nmust explain how his views altered, and why reasons which formerly\r\nsatisfied him satisfy him no longer. It may be that the Liberal party\r\nhave omitted to do this as they ought. Occupied by warm and incessant\r\ndiscussions, and conscious, I venture to believe, of their own honesty,\r\nfew of its members have been at the trouble of showing what were the\r\ncauses which modified their views, and what the stages of the process\r\nwhich carried them from the position of 1880 to that of 1886.\r\n\r\nOf that process I shall attempt in the following pages to give a sketch.\r\nSuch a sketch, though mainly retrospective, is pertinent to the issues\r\nwhich now divide the country. It will indicate the origin and the\r\nstrength of the chief reasons by which Liberals are now governed. And,\r\nif executed with proper fairness and truth, it may, as a study in\r\ncontemporary history, be of some little interest to those who in future\r\nwill attempt to understand our present conflict. The causes which\r\nunderlie changes of opinion are among the most obscure phenomena in\r\nhistory, because those who undergo, these changes are often only half\r\nconscious of them, and do not think of recording that which is\r\nimperceptible in its growth, and whose importance is not realized till\r\nit already belongs to the past.\r\n\r\nThe account which follows is based primarily on my own recollection of\r\nthe phases of opinion and feeling through which I myself, and the\r\nfriends whom I knew most intimately in the House of Commons, passed\r\nduring the Parliament which sat from 1880 till 1885. But I should not\r\nthink of giving it to the public if I did not believe that what happened\r\nto our minds happened to many others also, and that the record of our\r\nown slow movement from the position of 1880 to that of 1886 is\r\nsubstantially a record of the movement of the Liberal party at large. We\r\nwere fairly typical members of that party, loyal to our leaders, but\r\nplacing the principles for which the Liberal party exists above the\r\nsuccess of the party itself; with our share of prepossessions and\r\nprejudices, yet with reasonably open minds, and (as we believed)\r\ninferior to no other section of the House of Commons in patriotism and\r\nin attachment to the Constitution. I admit frankly that when we entered\r\nParliament we knew less about the Irish question than we ought to have\r\nknown, and that even after knowledge had been forced upon us, we were\r\nmore deferential to our leaders than was good either for us or for them.\r\nBut these are faults always chargeable on the great majority of members.\r\nIt is because those of whom I speak were in these respects fairly\r\ntypical, that it seems worth while to trace the history of their\r\nopinions. If any one should accuse me of attributing to an earlier year\r\nsentiments which began to appear in a later one, I can only reply that I\r\nam aware of this danger, as one which always besets those who recall\r\ntheir past states of mind, and that I have done my utmost to avoid it.\r\n\r\nThe change I have to describe was slow and gradual. It was\r\nreluctant--that is to say, it seemed rather forced upon us by the\r\nteaching of events than the work of our own minds. Each session marked a\r\nfurther stage in it; and I therefore propose to examine its progress\r\nsession by session.\r\n\r\nSession of 1880.--The General Election of 1880 turned mainly on the\r\nforeign policy of Lord Beaconsfield's Government. Few Liberal candidates\r\nsaid much about Ireland. Absorbed in the Eastern and Afghan questions,\r\nthey had not watched the progress of events in Ireland with the\r\nrequisite care, nor realized the gravity of the crisis which was\r\napproaching. They were anxious to do justice to Ireland, in the way of\r\namending both the land laws and local government, but saw no reason for\r\ngoing further. Nearly all of them refused, even when pressed by Irish\r\nelectors in their constituencies, to promise to vote for that\r\n\"parliamentary inquiry into the demand for Home Rule,\" which was then\r\npropounded by those electors as a sort of test question. We (_i.e._ the\r\nLiberal candidates of 1880) then declared that we thought an Irish\r\nParliament would involve serious constitutional difficulties, and that\r\nwe saw no reason why the Imperial Parliament should not do full justice\r\nto Ireland. Little was said about Coercion. Hopes were expressed that it\r\nwould not be resorted to, but very few (if any) pledged themselves\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Forster was appointed Irish Secretary in Mr. Gladstone's\r\nGovernment which the General Election brought into power, we (by which I\r\nmean throughout the new Liberal members) were delighted. We knew him to\r\nbe conscientious, industrious, kind-hearted. We believed him to be\r\npenetrating and judicious. We applauded his conduct in not renewing the\r\nCoercion Act which Lord Beaconsfield's Government had failed to renew\r\nbefore dissolving Parliament, and which indeed there was scarcely time\r\nleft after the election to renew, a fact which did not save Mr. Forster\r\nfrom severe censure on the part of the Tories.\r\n\r\nThe chief business of the session was the Compensation for Disturbance\r\nBill, which Mr. Forster brought in for the sake of saving from immediate\r\neviction tenants whom a succession of bad seasons had rendered utterly\r\nunable to pay their rents. This Bill was pressed through the House of\r\nCommons with the utmost difficulty, and at an expenditure of time which\r\ndamaged the other work of the session, though the House continued to sit\r\ninto September. The Executive Government declared it to be necessary, in\r\norder not only to relieve the misery of the people, but to secure the\r\ntranquillity of the country. Nevertheless, the whole Tory party, and a\r\nconsiderable section of the Liberal party, opposed it in the interests\r\nof the Irish landlords, and of economic principles in general,\r\nprinciples which (as commonly understood in England) it certainly\r\ntrenched on. When it reached the House of Lords it was contemptuously\r\nrejected, and the unhappy Irish Secretary left to face as he best might\r\nthe cries of a wretched peasantry and the rising tide of outrage. What\r\nwas even more remarkable, was the coolness with which the Liberal party\r\ntook the defeat of a Bill their leaders had pronounced absolutely\r\nneeded. Had it been an English Bill of the same consequence to England\r\nas it was to Ireland, the country would have been up in arms against the\r\nHouse of Lords, demanding the reform or the abolition of a Chamber which\r\ndared to disregard the will of the people. But nothing of the kind\r\nhappened. It was only an Irish measure. We relieved ourselves by a few\r\nstrong words, and the matter dropped.\r\n\r\nIt was in this session that the Liberal party first learnt what sort of\r\na spirit was burning in the hearts of Irish members. There had been\r\nobstruction in the last years of the previous Parliament, but, as the\r\nTories were in power, they had to bear the brunt of it. Now that a\r\nLiberal Ministry reigned, it fell on the Liberals. At first it incensed\r\nus. Full of our own good intentions towards Ireland, we thought it\r\ncontrary to nature that Irish members should worry us, their friends, as\r\nthey had worried Tories, their hereditary enemies. Presently we came to\r\nunderstand how matters stood. The Irish members made little difference\r\nbetween the two great English parties. Both represented to them a\r\nhostile domination. Both were ignorant of the condition of their\r\ncountry. Both cared so little about Irish questions that nothing less\r\nthan deeds of violence out of doors or obstruction within doors could\r\nsecure their attention. Concessions had to be extorted from both by the\r\nsame devices; Coercion might be feared at the hands of both. Hence the\r\nIrish party was resolved to treat both parties alike, and play off the\r\none against the other in the interests of Ireland alone, using the\r\nquestions which divide Englishmen and Scotchmen merely as levers\r\nwhereby to effect their own purposes, because themselves quite\r\nindifferent to the substantial merits of those questions. To us new\r\nmembers this was an alarming revelation. We found that the House of\r\nCommons consisted of two distinct and dissimilar bodies: a large British\r\nbody (including some few Tories and Liberals from Ireland), which,\r\nthough it was distracted by party quarrels, really cared for the welfare\r\nof the country and the dignity of the House, and would set aside its\r\nquarrels in the presence of a great emergency; and a small Irish body,\r\nwhich, though it spoke the English language, was practically foreign,\r\nfelt no interest in, no responsibility for, the business of Britain or\r\nthe Empire, and valued its place in the House only as a means of making\r\nitself so disagreeable as to obtain its release. When we had grasped\r\nthis fact, we began to reflect on its causes and conjecture its effects.\r\nWe had read of the same things in the newspapers, but what a difference\r\nthere is between reading a drama in your study and seeing it acted on\r\nthe stage! We realized what Irish feeling was when we heard these angry\r\ncries, and noted how appeals that would have affected English partisans\r\nfell on deaf ears. I remember how one night in the summer of 1880, when\r\nthe Irish members kept us up very late over some trivial Bill of theirs,\r\nrefusing to adjourn till they had extorted terms, a friend, sitting\r\nbeside me, said, \"See how things come round. They keep us out of bed\r\ntill five o'clock in the morning because our ancestors bullied theirs\r\nfor six centuries.\" And we saw that the natural relations of an\r\nExecutive, even a Liberal Executive, to the Irish members were those of\r\nstrife. Whose fault it was we were unable to decide. Perhaps the\r\nGovernment was too stiff; perhaps the members were vexatious. Anyhow,\r\nthis strife was evidently the normal state of things, wholly unlike that\r\nwhich existed between Scotch members, to whichever party they belonged,\r\nand the executive authorities of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThus the session of 1880, though it did not bring us consciously nearer\r\nto Home Rule, impressed three facts upon us: first, that the House of\r\nLords regarded Ireland solely from the point of view of English\r\nlandlords, sympathizing with Irish landlords; secondly, that the House\r\nof Commons knew so little or cared so little about Ireland that when the\r\nExecutive declared a measure essential to the peace of Ireland, it\r\nscarcely resented the rejection of that measure by the House of Lords;\r\nthirdly, that the Irish Nationalists in the House of Commons were a\r\nforeign body, foreign in the sense in which a needle which a man\r\nswallows is foreign, not helping the organism to discharge its\r\nfunctions, but impeding them, and setting up irritation. We did not yet\r\ndraw from these facts all the conclusions we should now draw. But the\r\nfacts were there, and they began to tell upon our minds.\r\n\r\nSESSION OF 1881.--The winter of 1880-81 was a terrible one in Ireland.\r\nThe rejection of the Compensation for Disturbance Bill had borne the\r\nfruit which Mr. Forster had predicted, and which the House of Lords had\r\nignored. Outrages were numerous and serious. The cry in England for\r\nrepressive measures had gone on rising from November, when it occasioned\r\na demonstration at the Guildhall banquet. Several Liberal members (of\r\nwhom I was one) went to Ireland at Christmas, to see with our own eyes\r\nhow things stood. We were struck by the difficulty of obtaining\r\ntrustworthy information in Dublin, where the richer classes, with whom\r\nwe chiefly came in contact, merely abused the Land League, while the\r\nLand Leaguers declared that the accounts of outrages were grossly\r\nexaggerated. The most prominent, Mr. Michael Davitt, assured me, and I\r\nbelieve with perfect truth, that he had exerted himself to\r\ndiscountenance outrage, and that if, as he expected, he was locked up by\r\nthe Government, outrages would increase. When one reached the disturbed\r\ndistricts, where, of course, one talked to members as well of the\r\nlandlord class as of the peasantry, the general conclusion which emerged\r\nfrom the medley of contradictions was that, though there was much\r\nagrarian crime, and a pervading sense of insecurity, the disorders were\r\nnot so bad as people in England believed, and might have been dealt with\r\nby a vigorous administration of the existing law. Unfortunately, the\r\nso-called \"better classes,\" full of bitterness against the Liberal\r\nMinistry and Mr. Forster (whom they did not praise till it was too\r\nlate), had not assisted the Executive, and had allowed things to reach a\r\npass at which it found the work of governing very difficult.\r\n\r\nWhen the Coercion Bill of 1881 was introduced, many English Liberals\r\nwere inclined to resist it. The great majority voted for it, but within\r\ntwo years they bitterly repented their votes. Our motives, which I\r\nmention by way of extenuation, not of defence, were these. The Executive\r\nGovernment declared that it could not deal with crime by the ordinary\r\nlaw. If its followers refused exceptional powers, they must displace the\r\nMinistry, and let in the Tories, who would doubtless obtain such powers,\r\nand probably use them worse. We had still confidence in Mr. Forster's\r\njudgment, and a deference to Irish Executive Governments generally which\r\nParliamentary experience is well fitted to dissipate. The violence with\r\nwhich the Nationalist members resisted the introduction of the Bill had\r\nroused our blood, and the foolish attempts which the Radical and Irish\r\nelectors in some constituencies had made to deter their members from\r\nsupporting it had told the other way, and disposed these members to vote\r\nfor it, in order to show that they were not to be cowed by threats.\r\nFinally, we were assured that votes given for the Coercion Bill would\r\npurchase a thorough-going Land Bill, and our anxiety for the latter\r\ninduced us, naturally, but erringly, to acquiesce in the former.\r\n\r\nWhen that Land Bill went into Committee we perceived how much harm the\r\nCoercion Bill had done in intensifying the bitterness of Irish members.\r\nAlthough the Ministry was fighting for their interests against the Tory\r\nparty and the so-called Whiggish section of its own supporters, who were\r\nseeking to cut down the benefits which the measure offered to Irish\r\ntenants, the Nationalist members regarded it, and in particular Mr.\r\nForster, as their foe. They resented what they deemed the insult put\r\nupon their country. They saw those who had been fighting, often, no\r\ndoubt, by unlawful methods, for the national cause, thrown into prison\r\nand kept there without trial. They anticipated (not without reason) the\r\nsame fortune for themselves. Hence the friendliness which the Liberal\r\nparty sought to show them met with no response, and Mr. Forster was\r\nworried with undiminished vehemence. In the discussions on the Bill we\r\nfound the Ministry generally resisting all amendments which came from\r\nIrish members. When these amendments seemed to us right, we voted for\r\nthem, but they were almost always defeated by the union of the Tories\r\nwith the steady Ministerialists. Subsequent events have proved that many\r\nwere right, but, whether they were right or wrong, the fact which\r\nimpressed us was that in matters which concerned Ireland only, and lay\r\nwithin the exclusive knowledge of Irishmen, Irish members were\r\nconstantly outvoted by English and Scotch members, who knew nothing at\r\nall of the merits of the case, but simply obeyed the party whip. This\r\nhappened even when the Irish members who sat on the Liberal side (such\r\nas Mr. Dickson and his Liberal colleagues from Ulster) joined the\r\nNationalist section in demanding some extension of the Bill which the\r\nMinistry refused. And we perceived that nothing incensed the Irish\r\nmembers more than the feeling that their arguments were addressed to\r\ndeaf ears; that they were overborne, not by reason, but by sheer weight\r\nof numbers. Even if they convinced the Ministry, they could seldom hope\r\nto obtain its assent, because the Ministry had to consider the House of\r\nLords, sure to reject amendments which favoured the tenant, while to\r\ndetach a number of Ministerialists sufficient to carry an amendment\r\nagainst the Treasury Bench, the Moderate Liberals, and the Tories, was\r\nevidently hopeless.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the session the House of Lords came again upon the scene.\r\nIt seriously damaged the Bill by its amendments, and would have\r\ndestroyed it but for the skill with which the head of the Government\r\nhandled these amendments, accepting the least pernicious, so as to\r\nenable the Upper House without loss of dignity to recede from those\r\nwhich were wholly inadmissible. Several times it seemed as if the\r\nconflict would have to pass from Westminster to the country, and, in\r\ncontemplating the chances of a popular agitation or a dissolution, we\r\nwere regretfully obliged to own that the English people cared too little\r\nand knew too little about Irish questions to give us much hope of\r\ndefeating the House of Lords and the Tories upon these issues.\r\n\r\nAn incident which occurred towards the end of the session seems, though\r\ntrifling in itself, so illustrative of the illogical position in which\r\nwe stood towards Ireland, as to deserve mention. Mr. Forster, still\r\nChief Secretary, had brought in a Bill for extinguishing the Queen's\r\nUniversity in Ireland, and creating in place of it a body to be called\r\nthe Royal University, which, however, was not to be a real university at\r\nall, but only a set of examiners plus some salaried fellowships, to be\r\nheld at various places of instruction. Regarding this as a gross\r\neducational blunder, which would destroy a useful existing body, and\r\ncreate a sham university in its place, and finding several Parliamentary\r\nfriends on whose judgment I could rely to be of the same opinion, I gave\r\nnotice of opposition to the Bill. Mr. Forster came to me, and pressed\r\nwith great warmth that the opposition should be withdrawn. The Bill, he\r\nsaid, would satisfy the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and complete the work\r\nof the Land Bill in pacifying Ireland. The Irish members wanted it: what\r\nbusiness had an English member to interfere to defeat their wishes, and\r\nthwart the Executive? The reply was obvious. Not to speak of the\r\nsimplicity of expecting the hierarchy to be satisfied by this small\r\nconcession, what were such arguments but the admission of Home Rule in\r\nits worst form? \"You resist the demand of the Irish members to legislate\r\nfor Ireland; you have just been demanding, and obtaining, the support of\r\nEnglish members against those amendments of the Land Bill which Irish\r\nmembers declare to be necessary. Now you bid us surrender our own\r\njudgment, ignore our own responsibility, and blindly pass a Bill which\r\nwe, who have studied these university questions as they affect both\r\nIreland and England, believe to be thoroughly mischievous to the\r\nprospects of higher education in Ireland, only because the Irish\r\nmembers, as you say, desire it. Do one thing or the other. Either give\r\nthem the power and the responsibility, or leave both with the Imperial\r\nParliament. You are now asking us to surrender the power, but to remain\r\nstill subject to the responsibility. We will not bear the latter without\r\nthe former. We shall prefer Home Rule.\" Needless to add that this\r\ndevice--a sample of the petty sops by which successive generations of\r\nEnglish statesmen, Whigs and Tories alike, have sought to win over a\r\npriesthood which uses and laughs at them--failed as completely as its\r\npredecessors to settle the University question or to range the bishops\r\non the side of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe autumn and winter of 1881 revealed the magnitude of the mischief\r\ndone by making a Coercion Bill precede a Relief Bill. The Land Bill was\r\nthe largest concession made to the demands of the people since Catholic\r\nEmancipation. It was a departure, justified by necessity, but still a\r\ndeparture from our established principles of legislation. It ought to\r\nhave brought satisfaction and confidence, if not gratitude, with it;\r\nought to have led Ireland to believe in the sincere friendliness of\r\nEngland, and produced a new cordiality between the islands. It did\r\nnothing of the kind. It was held to have been extorted from our fears;\r\nits grace and sweetness were destroyed by the concomitant severities\r\nwhich the Coercion Act had brought into force, as wholesome food becomes\r\ndistasteful when some bitter compound has been sprinkled over it. We\r\nwere deeply mortified at this result of our efforts. What was the malign\r\npower which made the boons we had conferred shrivel up, \"like fairy\r\ngifts fading away\"? We still believed the Coercion Act to have been\r\njustified, but lamented the fate which baffled the main object of our\r\nefforts, the winning over Ireland to trust the justice and the capacity\r\nof the Imperial Parliament. And thus the two facts which stood out from\r\nthe history of this eventful session were, first, that even in\r\nlegislating for the good of Ireland we were legislating against the\r\nwishes of Ireland, imposing on her enactments which her representatives\r\nopposed, and which we supported only at the bidding of the Ministry;\r\nand, secondly, that at the end of a long session, entirely devoted to\r\nher needs, we found her more hostile and not less disturbed than she had\r\nbeen at its beginning. We began to wonder whether we should ever succeed\r\nbetter on our present lines. But we still mostly regarded Home Rule as a\r\ndisagreeable solution.\r\n\r\nSESSION OF 1882.--Still graver were the lessons of the first four months\r\nof this year. Mr. Forster went on filling the prisons of Ireland with\r\npersons whom he arrested under the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, and\r\nnever brought to trial. But the country grew no more quiet. At last he\r\nhad nine hundred and forty men under lock and key, many of them not\r\n\"village ruffians,\" whose power a few weeks' detention was to break, but\r\npolitical offenders, and even popular leaders. How long could this go\r\non? Where was it to stop? It became plain that the Act was a failure,\r\nand that the people, trained to combination by a century and a half's\r\npractice, were too strong for the Executive. Either the scheme and plan\r\nof the Act had been wrong, or its administration had been incompetent.\r\nWhichever was the source of the failure (most people will now blame\r\nboth), the fault must be laid at the door of the Irish Executive; not of\r\nMr. Forster himself, but of those on whom he relied. It had been a\r\nDublin Castle Bill, conceived and carried out by the incompetent\r\nbureaucracy which has so long pretended to govern Ireland. Such a proof\r\nof incompetence destroyed whatever confidence in that bureaucracy then\r\nremained to us, and the disclosures which the Phoenix Park murders and\r\nthe subsequent proceedings against the Invincibles brought out, proved\r\nbeyond question that the Irish Executive had only succeeded in giving a\r\nmore dark and dangerous form, the form of ruthless conspiracy, to the\r\nagitation it was combating.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore the Prevention of Crime Bill of 1882 was brought in, some\r\nof us felt unable to support it, and specially bound to resist those of\r\nits provisions which related to trials without a jury, and to\r\nboycotting. It was impossible, on the morrow of the Phoenix Park\r\nmurders, to deny that some coercive measure might be needed; but we had\r\nso far lost faith in repression, and in the officials who were to\r\nadminister it, as to desire to limit it to what was absolutely\r\nnecessary, and we protested against enacting for Ireland a criminal code\r\nwhich was not to be applied to Great Britain. Our resistance might have\r\nbeen more successful but for the manner in which the Nationalist members\r\nconducted their opposition. When they began to obstruct--not that under\r\nthe circumstances we felt entitled to censure them for obstructing a\r\nBill dealing so harshly with their countrymen--we were obliged to\r\ndesist, and our experience of the stormy scenes of the summer of 1882\r\ndeepened our sense of the passionate bitterness with which they regarded\r\nEnglish members, scarcely making an exception in favour of those who\r\nwere most disposed to sympathize with them. Many and many a time when we\r\nlistened to their fierce cries, we seemed to hear in them the\r\nbattle-cries of the centuries of strife between Celt and Englishman from\r\nAthenry to Vinegar Hill; many a time we felt that this rage and mistrust\r\nwere chiefly of England's making; and yet not of England's, but rather\r\nof the overmastering fate which had prolonged to our own days the\r\nhatreds and the methods of barbarous times:\r\n\r\n            hêmeis d' ouk aitioi esmen\r\n    Alla Zeus kai Moira kai êerophoitis Herinus.\r\n\r\nSo much of the session as the Crime Bill had spared was consumed by the\r\nArrears Bill, over which we had again a \"crisis\" with the House of\r\nLords. This was the third session that had been practically given up to\r\nIrishmen. The freshness and force of the Parliament of 1880--a\r\nParliament full of zeal and ability--had now been almost spent, yet few\r\nof the plans of domestic legislation spread before the constituencies of\r\n1880 had been realized. The Government had been anxious to legislate,\r\ntheir majority had been ready to support them, but Ireland had blocked\r\nthe way; and now the only expedient for improving the procedure of the\r\nHouse was to summon Parliament in an extra autumn session. Here was\r\nanother cause for reflection. England and Scotland were calling for\r\nmeasures promised years ago, but no time could be found to discuss them.\r\nNothing was done to reorganize local government, to reform the liquor\r\nlaws, to improve secondary education, to deal with the housing of the\r\npoor, or a dozen other urgent questions, because we were busy with\r\nIreland; and yet how little more loyal or contented did Ireland seem to\r\nbe for all we had done. We began to ask whether Home Rule might not be\r\nas much an English and Scotch question as an Irish question. It was, at\r\nany rate, clear that to allow Ireland to manage her own affairs would\r\nopen a prospect for England and Scotland to obtain time to attend to\r\ntheirs.[3]\r\n\r\nThis feeling was strengthened by the result of the attempts made in the\r\nautumn session of 1882, to improve the procedure of the House of\r\nCommons. We had cherished the hope that more drastic remedies against\r\nobstruction and better arrangements for the conduct of business, might\r\nrelieve much of the pressure Irish members had made us suffer. The\r\npassing of the New Rules shattered this hope, for it was plain they\r\nwould not accomplish what was needed. Some blamed the Government for not\r\nframing a more stringent code. Some blamed the Tory and the Irish\r\nOppositions (now beginning to work in concert) for cutting down the\r\nproposals of the Government. But most of us saw, and came to see still\r\nmore clearly in the three succeeding sessions, that the evil was too\r\ndeep-rooted to be cured by any changes of procedure, unless they went so\r\nfar as to destroy freedom of debate for English members also. The\r\npresence in a deliberative assembly of a section numbering (or likely\r\nsoon to number) one-seventh of the whole--a section seeking to lower the\r\ncharacter of the assembly, and to derange its mechanism, with no further\r\ninterest in the greater part of its business except that of preventing\r\nit from conducting that business--this was the phenomenon which\r\nconfronted us, and we felt that no rules of debate would overcome the\r\ndangers it threatened.\r\n\r\nIt is from this year 1882 that I date the impression which we formed,\r\nthat Home Rule was sure to come. \"It may be a bold experiment,\" we said\r\nto one another in the lobbies; \"there are serious difficulties in the\r\nway, though the case for it is stronger than we thought two years ago.\r\nBut if the Irishmen persist as they are doing now, they will get it. It\r\nis only a question of their tenacity.\"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to be struck during the conflicts of 1881 and 1882\r\nwith the small amount of real bitterness which the conduct of the Irish\r\nmembers, irritating as it often was, provoked among the Liberals, who of\r\ncourse bore the brunt of the conflict. The Nationalists did their best\r\nto injure a Government which was at the same time being denounced by the\r\nTories as too favourable to Irish claims; they lowered the character of\r\nParliament by scenes far more painful than those of the session of 1887,\r\non which so much indignation has been lately expended; they said the\r\nhardest things they could think of against us in the House; they\r\nattacked us in our constituencies. Their partisans (for I do not charge\r\nthis on the leaders) interrupted and broke up our meetings.\r\nNevertheless, all this did not provoke responsive hatred from the\r\nLiberals. There could not be a greater contrast than that between the\r\nway in which the great bulk of the Liberal members all through the\r\nParliament of 1880 behaved towards their Irish antagonists, and the\r\nviolence with which the Tory members, under much slighter provocation,\r\nconduct themselves towards those antagonists now. I say this not to the\r\ncredit of our temper, which was no better than that of other men heated\r\nby the struggles of a crowded assembly. It was due entirely to our\r\nfeeling that there was a great balance of wrong standing to the debit of\r\nEngland; that if the Irish were turbulent, it was the ill-treatment of\r\nformer days that had made them so; and that, whatever might be their\r\nmethods, they were fighting for their country. Although, therefore,\r\nthere was little social intercourse between us and them, there was\r\nalways a hope and a wish that the day might come when the Liberal party\r\nshould resume its natural position of joining the representatives of the\r\nIrish people in obtaining radical reforms in Irish government. And the\r\nremarkable speech of February 9, 1882, in which Mr. Gladstone declared\r\nhis mind to be open on the subject, and invited the Nationalists to\r\npropound a practicable scheme of self-government, had encouraged us to\r\nhope that this day might soon arrive.\r\n\r\nSESSION OF 1883.--Three facts stood out in the history of this\r\ncomparatively quiet session, each of which brought us further along the\r\nroad we had entered.\r\n\r\nOne was the omission of Parliament to complete the work begun by the\r\nLand Bill of 1881, of improving the condition of the Irish peasantry and\r\nreorganizing Irish administration. The Nationalist members brought in\r\nBills for these purposes, including one for amending the Land Act by\r\nadmitting leaseholders to its benefits and securing tenants against\r\nhaving their improvements reckoned against them in the fixing of rents.\r\nThough we could not approve all the contents of these Bills, we desired\r\nto see the Government either take them up and amend them, or introduce\r\nBills of its own to do what was needed. Some of us spoke strongly in\r\nthis sense, nor will any one now deny that we were right. Sound policy\r\ncalled aloud for the completion of the undertaking of 1881. The\r\nGovernment however refused, alleging, no doubt with some truth, that\r\nIreland could not have all the time of Parliament, but must let England\r\nand Scotland have their turn. Nor was anything done towards the creation\r\nof new local institutions in Ireland, or the reform of the Castle\r\nbureaucracy. We were profoundly disheartened. We saw golden\r\nopportunities slipping away, and doubted more than ever whether\r\nWestminster was the place in which to legislate for Irish grievances.\r\n\r\nAnother momentous fact was the steady increase in the number of\r\nNationalist members. Every seat that fell vacant in Ireland was filled\r\nby them. The moderate Irish party, most of whom had by this time crossed\r\nthe floor of the House, and were sitting among us, had evidently no\r\nfuture. They were estimable, and, in some cases, able men, from whom we\r\nhad hoped much, as a link between the Liberal party and the Irish\r\npeople. But they seemed to have lost their hold on the people, nor were\r\nthey able to give us much practical counsel as to Irish problems. It was\r\nclear that they would vanish at the next General Election, and\r\nParliament be left to settle accounts with the extreme men, whose\r\nspirits rose as those of our friends steadily sank.\r\n\r\nLastly: it was in this session that the alliance of the Nationalists and\r\nthe Tory Opposition became a potent factor in politics. Its first\r\nconspicuous manifestation was in the defeat of the Government by the\r\nallied forces on the Affirmation Bill, when the least respectable\r\nprivates in both armies vied with one another in boisterous rejoicings\r\nover the announcement of numbers in the division. I do not refer to this\r\nas ground for complaint. It was in the course of our usual political\r\nwarfare that two groups, each hating and fearing the Ministry, should\r\nunite to displace it. But we now saw what power the Irish section must\r\nexert when it came to hold the balance of numbers in the House. Till\r\nthis division, the Government had commanded a majority of the whole\r\nHouse. This would probably not outlast a dissolution. What then? Could\r\nthe two English parties, differing so profoundly from one another,\r\ncombine against the third party? Evidently not. We must, therefore, look\r\nforward to unstable Governments, if not to a total dislocation of our\r\nParliamentary system.\r\n\r\nSession of 1884.--I pass over the minor incidents of this year,\r\nincluding the continued neglect of remedial legislation for Ireland to\r\ndwell on its dominant and most impressive lesson. It was the year of the\r\nFranchise Bill, which, as regards Ireland, worked an extension, not\r\nmerely of the county but also of the borough franchise, and produced,\r\nowing to the economic condition of the humbler classes in that country,\r\na far more extensive change than in England or Scotland. When the Bill\r\nwas introduced the question at once arose--Should Ireland be included?\r\n\r\nThere were two ways of treating Ireland between which Parliament had to\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\nOne was to leave her out of the Bill, on the ground that the masses of\r\nher population could not be trusted with the franchise, as being\r\nignorant, sympathetic to crime, hostile to the English Government. This\r\ncourse was the logical concomitant of exceptional coercive legislation,\r\nsuch as had been passed in 1881 and 1882. It was quite compatible with\r\ngenerous remedial legislation. But it placed Ireland in an unequal and\r\nlower position, treating her, as the Coercion Acts did, as a dependent\r\ncountry, inhabited by a population unfit for the same measure of power\r\nwhich the inhabitants of Britain might receive.\r\n\r\nThe other course was to bestow on Ireland the same extended franchise\r\nwhich the English county occupiers were to receive, applying the\r\nprinciple of equality, and disregarding the obvious consequences. These\r\nconsequences were both practical and logical. The practical consequence\r\nwas the increase in numbers and weight of the Irish party in Parliament\r\nhostile to Parliament itself. The logical consequence was the duty of\r\ncomplying with the wishes of the enfranchised nation. Whatever reasons\r\nwere good for giving this enlarged suffrage to the Irish masses, were\r\ngood for respecting the will which they might use to express it. If the\r\nIrish were deemed fit to exercise the same full constitutional rights\r\nin legislation as the English, must they not be fit for the same rights\r\nof trial by jury, a free press, and all the privileges of personal\r\nfreedom?\r\n\r\nOf these two courses the Cabinet chose the latter, those of its members\r\nwhom we must suppose, from the language they now hold, to have then\r\nhesitated, either stifling their fears or not apprehending the\r\nconsequences of their boldness. It might have been expected, and indeed\r\nwas generally expected, that the Tory party would refuse to follow. They\r\ntalked largely about the danger of an extended Irish suffrage, and\r\npointed out that it would be a weapon in the hands of disloyalty. But\r\nwhen the moment for resistance came, they swerved, and never divided in\r\neither House against the application of the Bill to Ireland. They might\r\nhave failed to defeat the measure; but they would have immensely\r\nstrengthened their position, logically and morally, had they given\r\neffect by their votes to the sentiments they were known to entertain,\r\nand which not a few Liberals shared.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this uncontested grant to Ireland of a suffrage\r\npractically universal was immense upon our minds, and the longer we\r\nreflected on it the more significant did it become. It meant to us that\r\nthe old methods were abandoned, and, as we supposed, for ever. We had\r\ndeliberately given the Home Rule party arms against English control far\r\nmore powerful than they previously possessed. We had deliberately\r\nasserted our faith in the Irish people. Impossible after this to fall\r\nback on Coercion Bills. Impossible to refuse any request compatible with\r\nthe general safety of the United Kingdom, which Ireland as a nation\r\nmight prefer. Impossible to establish that system of Crown Colony\r\nGovernment which we had come to perceive was the only real and solid\r\nalternative to self-government. To those of us who had been feeling that\r\nthe Irish difficulty was much the greatest of all England's\r\ndifficulties, this stood out beyond the agitation of the autumn and the\r\ncompromise of the winter as the great political event of 1884.[4]\r\n\r\nAlthough this sketch is in the main a record of Parliamentary opinion, I\r\nought not to pass over the influence which the study of their\r\nconstituents' ideas exerted upon members for the larger towns. We found\r\nthe vast bulk of our supporters--English supporters, for after 1882 it\r\nwas understood that the Irish voters were our enemies--sympathetic with\r\nthe Irish people. They knew and thought little about Home Rule,\r\nbelieving that their member understood that question better than they\r\ndid, and willing, so long as he was sound on English issues, to trust\r\nhim. But they pitied Irish tenants, and condemned Irish landlords.\r\nThough they acquiesced in a Coercion Bill when proposed by a Liberal\r\nCabinet, because they concluded that nothing less than necessity would\r\nlead such a Cabinet to propose one, they so much disliked any\r\nexceptional or repressive legislation that it was plain they would not\r\nlong tolerate it. Any popular leader denouncing coercion was certain to\r\nhave the sentiment of the English masses with him, while as to\r\nsuspending Irish representation or carrying out consistently the policy\r\nof treating Ireland as a subject country, there was no chance in the\r\nworld of their approval. Those of us, therefore, who represented large\r\nworking-class constituencies became convinced that the solution of the\r\nIrish problem must be sought in conciliation and self-government, if\r\nonly because the other solution, Crown Colony Government, was utterly\r\nrepugnant to the English masses, in whom the Franchise Bill of 1884,\r\ncompleting that of 1867, had vested political supremacy.[5]\r\n\r\nSession of 1885.--The allied powers of Toryism and Nationalism gained in\r\nthis year the victory they had so long striven for. In February they\r\nreduced the Ministerial majority to fourteen; in June they overthrew the\r\nMinistry. No one supposed that on either occasion the merits of the\r\nissue had anything to do with the Nationalist vote: that vote was given\r\nsimply and solely against the Government, as the Government which had\r\npassed the Coercion Acts of 1881 and 1882--Acts demanded by the Tory\r\nparty, and which had not conceded an Irish Parliament. At last the Irish\r\nparty had attained its position as the arbiter of power and office. Some\r\nof us said, as we walked away from the House, under the dawning light of\r\nthat memorable 9th of June, \"This means Home Rule.\" Our forecast was\r\nsoon to be confirmed. Lord Salisbury's Cabinet, formed upon the\r\nresignation of Mr. Gladstone's, announced that it would not propose to\r\nrenew any part of the Coercion Act of 1882, which was to expire in\r\nAugust. Here was a surrender indeed! But the Tory leaders went further.\r\nThey did not excuse themselves on the ground of want of time. They took\r\ncredit for their benevolence towards Ireland; they discovered excellent\r\nreasons why the Act should be dropped. They even turned upon Lord\r\nSpencer, whose administration they had hitherto blamed for its leniency,\r\nand attacked him in Parliament, among the cheers of his Irish enemies.\r\nFrom that time till the close of the General Election in December\r\neverything was done, short of giving public pledges, to keep the Irish\r\nleaders and the Irish voters in good humour. The Tory party in fact\r\nposed as the true friends of Ireland, averse from coercion, and with\r\nminds perfectly open on the subject of self-government.\r\n\r\nThis change of front, so sudden, so unblushing, completed the process\r\nwhich had been going on in our minds. By 1882 we had come to feel that\r\nHome Rule was inevitable, though probably undesirable. Before long we\r\nhad asked ourselves whether it was really undesirable, whether it might\r\nnot be a good thing both for England, whose Parliament and Cabinet\r\nsystem it would relieve from impending dangers, while leaving free scope\r\nfor domestic legislation, and for Ireland, which could hardly manage her\r\naffairs worse than we were managing them for her, and might manage them\r\nbetter. And thus, by the spring of 1885, many of us were prepared for a\r\nlarge scheme of local self-government in Ireland, including a central\r\nlegislative body in Dublin.[6]\r\n\r\nNow when it was plain that the English party which had hitherto called\r\nfor repression, and had professed itself anxious for a patriotic union\r\nof all parties to maintain order and a continuity of policy in Ireland,\r\nwas ready to bid for Irish help at the polls by throwing over repression\r\nand reversing the policy it had advocated, we felt that the sooner\r\nIreland was taken out of English party politics the better. What\r\nprospect was there of improving Ireland by the superior wisdom and\r\nfairness of the British Parliament, if British leaders were to make\r\ntheir Irish policy turn on interested bargains with Nationalist leaders?\r\nRepression, which we clearly saw to be the only alternative to\r\nself-government, seemed to be by common consent abandoned. I remember\r\nhow, at a party of members in the beginning of July, some one said,\r\n\"Well, there's an end for ever of coercion at any rate,\" and every one\r\nassented as to an obvious truth. Accordingly the result of the new\r\ndeparture of the Salisbury Cabinet in 1885 was to convince even doubters\r\nthat Home Rule must come, and to make those already convinced anxious to\r\nsee it come quickly, and to find the best form that could be given it.\r\nMany of us expected the Tory Government to propose it. Rumour declared\r\nthe new Lord Lieutenant to be in favour of it. His government was\r\nextremely conciliatory in Ireland, even to the recalcitrant corporation\r\nof Limerick. Not to mention less serious and less respected Tory\r\nMinisters, Lord Salisbury talked at Newport about the dualism of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Monarchy with the air of a man who desired to have a\r\nworkable scheme, analogous, if not similar, suggested for Ireland and\r\nGreat Britain. The Irish Nationalists appeared to place their hopes in\r\nthis quarter, for they attacked the Liberal party with unexampled\r\nbitterness, and threw all their voting strength into the Tory scale.\r\n\r\nAs it has lately been attempted to blacken the character of the Irish\r\nleaders, it deserves to be remarked that whatever has been charged\r\nagainst them was said or done by them before the spring of 1885, and\r\nwas, practically, perfectly well known to the Tory leaders when they\r\naccepted the alliance of the Irish party in the House of Commons, and\r\ncourted their support in the election of 1885. To those who remember\r\nwhat went on in the House in the sessions of 1884 and 1885, the horror\r\nnow professed by the Tory leaders for the conduct and words of the Irish\r\nparty would be matter for laughter if it were not also matter for just\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be asked, if the persuasion that Home Rule was certain, and\r\neven desirable, had become general among the Liberals who had sat\r\nthrough the Parliament of 1880, was it not more fully expressed at the\r\nelection of 1885? This is a fair question, which I shall try to answer.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the electors made few inquiries about Ireland. They\r\ndisliked the subject; they had not realized its supreme importance.\r\nThose of us who felt anxious to explain our views (as was my own case)\r\nhad to volunteer to do so, for we were not asked about them. The Irish\r\nparty in the constituencies was in violent opposition to Liberal\r\ncandidates; it did not interrogate, but denounced. Further, it was felt\r\nthat the issue was mainly one to be decided in Ireland itself. The\r\nquestion of Home Rule was being submitted, not, as heretofore, to a\r\nlimited constituency, but to the whole Irish people. Till their will had\r\nbeen constitutionally declared at the polls it was not proper that\r\nEnglishmen or Scotchmen should anticipate its tenour. We should even\r\nhave been accused, had we volunteered our opinions, of seeking to affect\r\nthe result in Ireland, and, not only of playing for the Irish vote in\r\nGreat Britain, as we saw the Tories doing, but of prejudicing the\r\nchances of those Liberal candidates who, in Irish constituencies, were\r\ncompeting with extreme Nationalists. A third reason was that most\r\nEnglish and Scotch Liberals did not know how far their own dispositions\r\ntowards Home Rule were shared by their leaders. Mr. Gladstone's\r\ndeclaration in his Midlothian address was no doubt a decided intimation\r\nof his views, and was certainly understood by some (as by myself) to\r\nimply the grant to Ireland of a Parliament; but, strong as its words\r\nwere, its importance does not seem to have been fully appreciated at the\r\nmoment. And the opinions of a statesman whose unequalled Irish\r\nexperience and elevated character gave him a weight only second to that\r\nof Mr. Gladstone--I mean Lord Spencer--had not been made known. We had\r\nconsequently no certainty that there were leaders prepared to give\r\nprompt effect to the views we entertained. Lastly, we were not prepared\r\nwith a practical scheme of self-government for Ireland. The Nationalist\r\nmembers had propounded none which we could either adopt or criticize.\r\nConvinced as we were that Home Rule would come and must come, we felt\r\nthe difficulties surrounding every suggestion that had yet been made,\r\nand had not hammered out any plan which we could lay before the electors\r\nas approved by Liberal opinion.[7] We were forced to confine ourselves\r\nto generalities.\r\n\r\nWhether it would have been better for us to have done our thinking and\r\nscheme-making in public, and thereby have sooner forced the details of\r\nthe problem upon the attention of the country, need not now be inquired.\r\nAny one can now see that something was lost by the omission. But those\r\nwho censure a course that has actually been taken usually fail to\r\nestimate the evils that would have followed from the taking of the\r\nopposite course. Such evils might in this instance have been as great as\r\nthose we have encountered.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the importance we attached to the decision of Ireland\r\nitself, and of the attitude of expectancy which, while that decision was\r\nuncertain, Englishmen were forced to maintain. We had not long to wait.\r\nEarly in December it was known that five-sixths of the members returned\r\nfrom Ireland were Nationalists, and that the majorities which had\r\nreturned them were crushing. If ever a people spoke its will, the Irish\r\npeople spoke theirs at the election of 1885. The last link in the chain\r\nof conviction, which events had been forging since 1880, was now\r\nsupplied. In passing the Franchise Bill of 1884, we had asked Ireland to\r\ndeclare her mind. She had now answered. If the question was not a\r\nmockery, and representative government a sham, we were bound to accept\r\nthe answer, subject only, but subject always, to the interests of the\r\nwhole United Kingdom. In other words, we were bound to devise such a\r\nscheme of self-government for Ireland as would give full satisfaction to\r\nher wishes, while maintaining the ultimate supremacy of the Imperial\r\nParliament and the unity of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nVery few words are needed to summarize the outline which, omitting many\r\ndetails which would have illustrated and confirmed its truth, I have\r\nattempted to present of the progress of opinion among Liberal members of\r\nthe Parliament of 1880.\r\n\r\n1. Our experience of the Coercion Bills of 1881 and 1882 disclosed the\r\nenormous mischief which such measures do in alienating the minds of\r\nIrishmen, and the difficulty of enlisting Irish sentiment on behalf of\r\nthe law. The results of the Act of 1881 taught us that the repression of\r\nopen agitation means the growth of far more dangerous conspiracy; those\r\nof the Act of 1882 proved that even under an administration like Lord\r\nSpencer's repression works no change for the better in the habits and\r\nideas of the people.\r\n\r\n2. The conduct of the House of Lords in 1880 and 1881, and the malign\r\ninfluence which its existence exerted whenever remedial legislation for\r\nIreland came in question, convinced us that full and complete justice\r\nwill never be done to Ireland by the British Parliament while the Upper\r\nHouse (as at present constituted) remains a part of that Parliament.\r\n\r\n3. The break-down of the procedure of the House of Commons, and the\r\nfailure of the efforts to amend it, proved that Parliament cannot work\r\nso long as a considerable section of its members seek to impede its\r\nworking. To enable it to do its duty by England and Scotland, it was\r\nevidently necessary, either to make the Irish members as loyal to\r\nParliament as English and Scotch members usually are, or else to exclude\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n4. The discussions of Irish Bills in the House of Commons made us\r\nrealize how little English members knew about Ireland; how utterly\r\ndifferent were their competence for, and their attitude towards, Irish\r\nquestions and English questions. We perceived that we were legislating\r\nin the dark for a country whose economic and social condition we did not\r\nunderstand--a country to which we could not apply our English ideas of\r\npolicy; a country whose very temper and feeling were strange to us. We\r\nwere really fitter to pass laws for Canada or Australia than for this\r\nisle within sight of our shores.\r\n\r\n5. I have said that we were legislating in the dark. But there were two\r\nquarters from which light was proffered, the Irish members and the Irish\r\nExecutive. We rejected the first, and could hardly help doing so, for to\r\naccept it would have been to displace our own leaders. We followed the\r\nlight which the Executive gave. But in some cases (as notably in the\r\ncase of the Coercion Bill of 1881) it proved to be a \"wandering fire,\"\r\nleading us into dangerous morasses. And we perceived that at all times\r\nlegislation at the bidding of the Executive, against the wishes of Irish\r\nmembers, was not self-government or free government. It was despotism.\r\nThe rule of Ireland by the British Parliament was really \"the rule of a\r\ndependency through an official, responsible no doubt, but responsible\r\nnot to the ruled, but to an assembly of which they form less than a\r\nsixth part.\"[8] As this assembly closed its ears to the one-sixth, and\r\ngave effect to the will of the official, this was essentially arbitrary\r\ngovernment, and wanted those elements of success which free government\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nThis experience had, by 1884, convinced us that the present relations of\r\nthe British Parliament to Ireland were bad, and could not last; that the\r\ndiscontent of Ireland was justified; that the existing system, in\r\nalienating the mind of Ireland, tended, not merely to Repeal, but to\r\nSeparation; that the simplest, and probably the only effective, remedy\r\nfor the increasing dangers was the grant of an Irish Legislature. Two\r\nevents clinched these conclusions. One was the Tory surrender of June,\r\n1885. Self-government, we had come to see, was the only alternative to\r\nCoercion, and now Coercion was gone. The other was the General Election\r\nof December, 1885, when newly-enfranchised Ireland, through five-sixths\r\nof her representatives, demanded a Parliament of her own.\r\n\r\nThese were not, as is sometimes alleged, conclusions of despair. We were\r\nmostly persons of a cautious and conservative turn of mind, as men\r\nimbued with the spirit of the British Constitution ought to be. The\r\nfirst thing was to convince us that the existing relations of the\r\nislands were faulty, and could not be maintained. This was a negative\r\nresult, and while we remained in that stage we were despondent. Many\r\nLiberal members will remember the gloom that fell on us in 1882 and 1883\r\nwhenever we thought or spoke of Ireland. But presently the clouds\r\nlifted. We still felt the old objections to any Home Rule scheme, though\r\nwe now saw that they were less formidable than the evils of the present\r\nsystem. But we came to feel that the grant of self-government was a\r\nright thing in itself. It was not merely a means of ridding ourselves of\r\nour difficulties, not merely a boon yielded because long demanded. It\r\nwas a return to broad and deep principles, a conformity to those\r\nnatural laws which govern human society as well as the inanimate\r\nworld--an effort to enlist the better and higher feelings of mankind in\r\nthe creation of a truer union between the two nations than had ever yet\r\nexisted. When we perceived this, hope returned. It is strong with us\r\nnow, for, though we see troubles, perhaps even dangers, in the immediate\r\nfuture, we are confident that the principles on which Liberal policy\r\ntowards Ireland is based will in the long run work out a happy issue for\r\nher, as they have in and for every other country that has trusted to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOne last word as to Consistency. We learnt in the Parliament of 1880\r\nmany facts about Ireland we had not known before; we felt the force and\r\nbearing of other facts previously accepted on hearsay, but not realized.\r\nWe saw the Irish problem change from what it had been in 1880 into the\r\nnew phase which stood apparent at the end of 1885, Coercion abandoned by\r\nits former advocates, Self-government demanded by the nation. Were we to\r\ndisregard all these new facts, ignore all these new conditions, and\r\ncling to old ideas, some of which we perceived to be mistaken, while\r\nothers, still true in themselves, were out-weighed by arguments of far\r\nwider import? We did not so estimate our duty. We foresaw the taunts of\r\nfoes and the reproaches of friends. But we resolved to give effect to\r\nthe opinions we slowly, painfully, even reluctantly formed, opinions all\r\nthe stronger because not suddenly adopted, and founded upon evidence\r\nwhose strength no one can appreciate till he has studied the causes of\r\nIrish discontent in Irish history, and been forced (as we were) to face\r\nin Parliament the practical difficulties of the government of Ireland by\r\nthe British House of Commons.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I may mention here another fact whose significance\r\nimpressed some among us. Parliament, which usually sinned in not doing\r\nfor Ireland what Ireland asked, occasionally passed bills for Ireland\r\nwhich were regarded as setting very bad precedents for England. By some\r\nbargain between the Irish Office and the Nationalist members, measures\r\nwere put through which may have been right as respects Ireland, but\r\nwhich embodied principles mischievous as respects Great Britain. We felt\r\nthat if it was necessary to enact such statutes, it would be better that\r\nthey should proceed from an Irish Legislature rather than from the\r\nImperial Parliament, which might be embarrassed by its own acts when\r\nasked to extend the same principles to England. The Labourers' Act of\r\nJuly, 1885, is the most conspicuous example.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: At Easter, 1885, I met a number of leading Ulster Liberals\r\nin Belfast, told them that Home Rule was certainly coming, and urged\r\nthem to prepare some plan under which any special interests they\r\nconceived the Protestant part of Ulster to have, would be effectually\r\nsafe-guarded. They were startled, and at first discomposed, but\r\npresently told me I was mistaken; to which I could only reply that time\r\nwould show, and perhaps sooner then even English Liberals expected.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: My recollection of a conversation with a distinguished\r\npublic man in July, 1882, enables me to say that this fact had impressed\r\nitself upon us as early as that year. He doubted the fact, but admitted\r\nthat, if true, it was momentous. The passing of the Franchise Bill made\r\nit, in our view, more momentous than ever.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Some thought that its functions should be very limited,\r\nwhile large powers were granted to county boards or provincial councils.\r\nBut most had, I think, already perceived that the grant of a merely\r\nlocal self-government, while retaining an irresponsible central\r\nbureaucracy, would do more harm than good. It seemed at first sight a\r\nsafer experiment than the creation of a central legislative body. But,\r\nlike many middle courses, it combined the demerits and wanted the merits\r\nof each of the extreme courses. It would not make the country tranquil,\r\nas firm and long-continued repression might possibly do. Neither would\r\nit satisfy the people's demands, and divert them from struggles against\r\nEngland to disputes and discussions among themselves, as the gift of\r\ngenuine self-government might do.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Some of us had tried to do so. I prepared such a scheme in\r\nthe autumn of 1885, and submitted it to some specially competent\r\nfriends. Their objections, made from what would now be called the\r\nUnionist point of view, were weighty. But their effect was to convince\r\nme that the scheme erred on the side of caution; and I believe the\r\nexperience of other Liberals who worked at the problem to have been the\r\nsame as my own--viz. that a small and timid scheme is more dangerous\r\nthan a large and bold one. Thus the result of our thinking from July,\r\n1885, till April, 1886, was to make us more and more disposed to reject\r\nhalf-and-half solutions. Some of us (of whom I was one) expressed this\r\nfeeling by saying in our election addresses in 1885, \"the further we go\r\nin giving the Irish people the management of their own affairs (subject\r\nto the maintenance of the unity of the empire) the better.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Quoted from an article contributed by myself to the\r\nAmerican _Century Magazine_, which I refer to because, written in the\r\nspring of 1883, it expresses the ideas here stated.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME RULE AND IMPERIAL UNITY\r\n\r\nBY LORD THRING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal charge made against the scheme of Home Rule contained in\r\nthe Irish Government Bill, 1886, is that it is incompatible with the\r\nmaintenance of the unity of the Empire and the supremacy of the Imperial\r\nParliament. A further allegation states that the Bill is useless, as\r\nagrarian exasperation lies at the root of Irish discontent and Irish\r\ndisloyalty, and that no place would be found for a Home Rule Bill even\r\nin Irish aspirations if an effective Land Bill were first passed. An\r\nendeavour will be made in the following pages to secure a verdict of\r\nacquittal on both counts--as to the charge relating to Imperial unity\r\nand the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament, by proving that the\r\naccusation is absolutely unfounded, and based partly on a misconception\r\nof the nature of Imperial ties, and partly on a misapprehension of the\r\neffect of the provisions of the Home Rule Bill as bearing on Imperial\r\nquestions; and as to the inutility of the Home Rule Bill in view of the\r\nnecessity of Land Reform, by showing that without a Home Rule Bill no\r\nLand Bill worth consideration as a means of pacifying Ireland can be\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nThe complete partisan spirit in which Home Rule has been treated is the\r\nmore to be deplored as the subject is one which does not lend itself\r\nreadily to the trivialities of party debates. It raises questions of\r\nprinciple, not of detail. It ascends at once into the highest region of\r\npolitics. It is conversant with the great questions of constitutional\r\nand international law, and leads to an inquiry into the very nature of\r\ngovernments and the various modes in which communities of men are\r\nassociated together either as simple or composite nations. To describe\r\nthose modes in detail would be to give a history of the various\r\ndespotic, monarchical, oligarchical, and democratic systems of\r\ngovernment which have oppressed or made happy the children of men. Such\r\na description is calculated to perplex and mislead from its very extent;\r\nnot so an inquiry into the powers of government, and a classification of\r\nthose powers. They are limited in extent, and, if we confine ourselves\r\nto English names and English necessities, we shall readily attain to an\r\napprehension of the mode in which empires, nations, and political\r\nsocieties are bound together, at least in so far as such knowledge is\r\nrequired for the understanding of the nature of Imperial supremacy, and\r\nthe mode in which Home Rule in Ireland is calculated to affect that\r\nsupremacy.\r\n\r\nThe powers of government are divisible into two great classes--1.\r\nImperial powers; 2. State powers, using \"State\" in the American sense of\r\na political community subordinated to some other power, and not in the\r\nsense of an independent nation. The Imperial powers are in English law\r\ndescribed as the prerogatives of the Crown, and consist in the main of\r\nthe powers of making peace and war, of maintaining armies and fleets and\r\nregulating commerce, and making treaties with foreign nations. State\r\npowers are complete powers of local self-government, described in our\r\ncolonial Constitutions as powers to make laws \"for the peace, order, and\r\ngood government of the Colony or State\" in which such powers are to be\r\nexercised.\r\n\r\nIntermediate between the Imperial and State powers are a class of\r\npowers required to prevent disputes and facilitate intercourse between\r\nthe various parts of an empire or other composite system of States--for\r\nexample, the coinage of money, and other regulations relating to the\r\ncurrency; the laws relating to copyright, or other exclusive rights to\r\nthe use and profits of any works or inventions; and so forth. These\r\npowers may be described as quasi-Imperial powers.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at a competent knowledge of the materials out of which\r\ngovernments are formed, it may be well to proceed to a consideration of\r\nthe manner in which those materials have been worked up in building the\r\ntwo great Anglo-Saxon composite nations--namely, the American Union and\r\nthe British Empire--for, if we find that the arrangements proposed by\r\nthe Irish Home Rule Bill are strictly in accordance with the principles\r\non which the unity of the American Union was based and on which the\r\nImperial power of Great Britain has rested for centuries, the conclusion\r\nmust be that the Irish Home Rule Bill is not antagonistic to the unity\r\nof the Empire or to the supremacy of the British Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn discussing these matters it will be convenient to begin with the\r\nAmerican Union, as it is less extensive in area and more homogeneous in\r\nits construction than the British Empire. The thirteen revolted American\r\ncolonies, on the conclusion of their war with England, found themselves\r\nin the position of thirteen independent States having no connection with\r\neach other. The common tie of supremacy exercised by the mother country\r\nwas broken, and each State was an independent nation, possessed both of\r\nImperial and Local rights.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of a cluster of thirteen small independent nations\r\nmaintaining their independence against foreign aggression became\r\nimmediately apparent, and, to remedy this evil, the thirteen States\r\nappointed delegates to form a convention authorized to weld them into\r\none body as respected Imperial powers. This was attempted to be done by\r\nthe establishment of a central body called a Congress, consisting of\r\ndelegates from the component States, and invested with all the powers\r\ndesignated above as Imperial and quasi-Imperial powers. The expenses\r\nincurred by the confederacy were to be defrayed out of a common fund, to\r\nbe supplied by requisitions made on the several States. In effect, the\r\nconfederacy of the thirteen States amounted to little more than an\r\noffensive and defensive alliance between thirteen independent nations,\r\nas the central power had States for its subjects and not individuals,\r\nand could only enforce the law against any disobedient State by calling\r\non the twelve other States to make war on the refractory member of the\r\nunion. A system dependent for its efficacy on the concurrence of so many\r\nseparate communities contained in itself the seeds of dissolution, and\r\nit soon became apparent that one of two things must occur--either the\r\nAmerican States must cease as such to be a nation, or the component\r\nmembers of that union must each be prepared to relinquish a further\r\nportion of the sovereign or quasi-sovereign powers which it possessed.\r\nUnder those circumstances, what was the course taken by the thirteen\r\nStates? They perceived that it was quite possible to maintain complete\r\nunity and compactness as a nation if, in addition to investing the\r\nSupreme Government with Imperial and quasi-Imperial powers, they added\r\nfull power to impose federal taxes on the component States and\r\nestablished an Executive furnished with ample means to carry all federal\r\npowers into effect through the medium of federal officers. The\r\ngovernment so formed consisted of a President and two elected Houses\r\ncalled Congress, and, as a balance-wheel of the Constitution, a Supreme\r\nCourt was established, to which was confided the task of deciding in\r\ncase of dispute all questions arising under the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States or relating to international law. The Executive of the\r\nUnited States, with the President as its source and head, was furnished\r\nwith full authority and power to enforce the federal laws. The army and\r\nnavy were under its command, and it was provided with courts of justice,\r\nand subordinate officers to enforce the decrees of those courts\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the Union. Above all, a complete\r\nsystem of federal taxation supplied the Central Government with the\r\nnecessary funds to perform effectually all the functions of a supreme\r\nnational government.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the Constitution of the United States will be best\r\nunderstood by considering the position in which its subjects stand to\r\nthe Central Government and their own State Governments. In effect, every\r\ninhabitant of the United States has a double nationality. He belongs to\r\none great nation called the United States, or, as it would be more aptly\r\ncalled to show its absolute unity, the American Republic, having\r\njurisdiction over the whole surface of ground comprised in the area of\r\nthe United States. He is also a citizen of a smaller local and partially\r\nself-governing body--more important than a county, but not approaching\r\nthe position of a nation--called a State.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of the object of this article to enter into the details of\r\nthe American government, its advantages or defects. This much, however,\r\nis clear--the American Constitution has lasted nearly one hundred years,\r\nand shows no signs of decay or disruption. It has stood the strain of\r\nthe greatest war of modern times, and has emerged from the conflict\r\nstronger than before. Even during the war the antagonism of the rebels\r\nwas directed, not against the Union, but against the efforts of the\r\nNorthern States to suppress slavery, or, in other words, to destroy, as\r\nthe Southern States believed (not unjustly as the event showed), their\r\nproperty in slaves, and consequently the only means they had of making\r\ntheir estates profitable. One conclusion, then, we may draw, that a\r\nnation in which the Imperial powers and the State powers are vested in\r\ndifferent authorities is no less compact and powerful, as respects all\r\nnational capacities, than a nation in which both classes of powers are\r\nwielded by the same functionaries; and one lesson more may be learnt\r\nfrom the American War of Secession--namely, that in a nation having such\r\na division of powers, any conflict between the two classes results in\r\nthe Supreme or Imperial powers prevailing over the Local governmental\r\npowers, and not in the latter invading or driving a wedge into the\r\nSupreme powers. In fact, the tendency in case of a struggle is towards\r\nan undue centralization of the nation by reason of the encroachment by\r\nthe Supreme authority, rather than towards a weakening of the national\r\nunity by separatist action on the part of the constituent members of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the Constitution of the United States with the Constitution\r\nof the British Empire, we find an apparent resemblance in form as\r\nrespects the Anglo-Saxon colonies, but underlying the surface a total\r\ndifference of principle. The United States is an aggregate of\r\nhomogeneous and contiguous States which, in order to weld themselves\r\ninto a nation, gave up a portion of their rights to a central authority,\r\nreserving to themselves all powers of government which they did not\r\nexpressly relinquish.\r\n\r\nThe British Empire is an aggregate of many communities under one common\r\nhead, and is thus described by Mr. Burke in 1774, in language which may\r\nseem to have been somewhat too enthusiastic at the time when it was\r\nspoken, but at the present day does not more than do justice to an\r\nEmpire which comprises one-sixth of the habitable globe in extent and\r\npopulation:--\r\n\r\n\"I look, I say, on the Imperial rights of Great Britain, and the\r\nprivileges which the colonies ought to enjoy under those rights, to be\r\njust the most reconcilable things in the world. The Parliament of Great\r\nBritain sits at the head of her extensive Empire in two capacities: one\r\nas the local legislature of this island, providing for all things at\r\nhome immediately and by no other instrument than the executive power;\r\nthe other, and I think her nobler capacity, is what I call her Imperial\r\ncharacter, in which, as from the throne of heaven, she superintends all\r\nthe several Legislatures, and guides and controls them all without\r\nannihilating any. As all these provincial Legislatures are only\r\nco-ordinate with each other, they ought all to be subordinate to her,\r\nelse they can neither preserve mutual peace, nor hope for mutual\r\njustice, nor effectually afford mutual assistance.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThe means by which the possessions of Great Britain were acquired have\r\nbeen as various as the possessions themselves. The European, Asiatic,\r\nand African possessions became ours by conquest and cession; the\r\nAmerican by conquest, treaty, and settlement; the Australasian by\r\nsettlement, and by that dubious system of settlement known by the name\r\nof annexation. Now, what is the link which fastens each of these\r\npossessions to the mother country? Surely it is the inherent and\r\nindestructible right of the British Crown to exercise Imperial\r\npowers--in other words, the supremacy of the Queen and the British\r\nParliament? What, again, is the common bond of union between these vast\r\ncolonial possessions, differing in laws, in religion, and in the\r\ncharacter of the population? The same answer must be given: the joint\r\nand several tie, so to speak, is the same--namely, the sovereignty of\r\nGreat Britain. It is true that the mode in which the materials composing\r\nthe British Empire have been cemented together is exactly the reverse of\r\nthe manner of the construction of the American Union. In the case of the\r\nUnion, independent States voluntarily relinquished a portion of their\r\nsovereignty to secure national unity, and entrusted the guardianship of\r\nthat unity to a representative body chosen by themselves. Such a union\r\nwas based on contract, and could only be constructed by communities\r\nwhich claimed to be independent. Far different have been the\r\ncircumstances under which England has developed itself into the British\r\nEmpire. England began as a sovereign power, having its sovereignty\r\nvested at first solely in the Sovereign, but gradually in the Sovereign\r\nand Parliament. This sovereignty neither the Crown nor the Parliament\r\ncan, jointly or severally, get rid of, for it is of the very essence of\r\na sovereign power that it cannot, by Act of Parliament or otherwise,\r\nbind its successors.[10] This principle of supremacy has never been lost\r\nsight of by the British Parliament. Their right to alter or suspend a\r\ncolonial Constitution has never been disputed. Contract never enters\r\ninto the question. The dominant authority delegates to its subordinate\r\ncommunities as much or as little power as it deems advantageous for each\r\nbody, and, if it sees fit, resumes a portion or the whole of the\r\ndelegated authority. The last point of difference to be noted between\r\nthe American Constitution and the Constitution of the British Empire is\r\nthe fact that as Minerva sprang from the brain of Jupiter fully\r\nequipped, so the American Constitution came forth from the hands of its\r\nframers complete and, what is of more importance, practically in\r\nmaterial matters unchangeable except by the agony of an internecine war\r\nor some overwhelming passions. The British Empire, on the other hand,\r\nis, as respects its component members, ever in progress and flux. An\r\nAnglo-Saxon colony, no less than a human being, has its infancy under\r\nthe maternal care of a governor, its boyhood subject to the government\r\nof a representative council and an Executive appointed by the Crown, its\r\nmanhood under Home Rule and responsible government, in which the\r\nExecutive are bound to vacate their offices whenever they are out-voted\r\nin the Legislature. Changes are ever taking place in the growth, so to\r\nspeak, of the several British possessions, but what is the result?\r\nNobody ever dreams of these changes injuring the Imperial tie or the\r\nsupremacy of the British Parliament, that alone towers above all,\r\nunchangeable and unimpaired; and, what is most notable, loyalty and\r\ndevotion to the Crown--that is to say, the Imperial tie--so far from\r\nbeing weakened by the transition of a colony from a state of dependence\r\nin local affairs to the higher degree of a self-governing colony, are,\r\non the contrary, strengthened almost in direct proportion as the central\r\ninterference with local affairs is diminished. On this point an\r\nunimpeachable witness--Mr. Merivale--says: \"What, then, are the lessons\r\nto be learnt from a consideration of the American Constitution and of\r\nour colonial system? Surely these: that Imperial unity and Imperial\r\nsupremacy are in no degree dependent on the control exercised by the\r\ncentral power on its dependent members.\" Facts, however, are more\r\nconclusive than any arguments; and we have only to look back to the\r\nstate some forty years ago of Canada, New Zealand, and the various\r\ncolonies of Australia, and compare that state with their condition\r\nto-day, to come to the conclusion that the fullest power of local\r\ngovernment is perfectly consistent with the unity of the Empire and the\r\nsupremacy of the British Parliament. Under the old colonial\r\nConstitutions the Executive of those colonies was under the control of\r\nthe Crown; and Mr. Merivale says \"that the political existence consisted\r\nof a series of quarrels and reconciliations between the two opposing\r\nauthorities--the colonial legislative body and the Executive nominated\r\nby the Crown.\" England resolved to give up the control of the Executive,\r\nand to grant complete responsible government--that is to say, the\r\nGovernor of each colony was instructed that his Executive Council (or\r\nMinistry, as we should call it) must resign whenever they were out-voted\r\nby the legislative body. The effect of this change, this relaxing, as\r\nwould be supposed, of the Imperial tie, was magical, and is thus\r\ndescribed by Mr. Merivale:[11]\r\n\r\n\"The magnitude of that change--the extraordinary rapidity of its\r\nbeneficial effects--it is scarcely possible to exaggerate. None but\r\nthose who have traced it can realize the sudden spring made by a young\r\ncommunity under its first release from the old tie of subjection,\r\nmoderate as that tie really was. The cessation, as if by magic, of the\r\nold irritant sores between colony and mother country is the first\r\nresult. Not only are they at concord, but they seem to leave hardly any\r\ntraces in the public mind behind them. Confidence and affection towards\r\nthe home, still fondly so termed by the colonist as well as the\r\nemigrant, seem to supersede at once distrust and hostility. Loyalty,\r\nwhich was before the badge of a class suspected by the rest of the\r\ncommunity, became the common watchword of all, and, with some\r\nextravagance in the sentiment, there arises no small share of its\r\nnobleness and devotion. Communities, which but a few years ago would\r\nhave wrangled over the smallest item of public expenditure to which they\r\nwere invited by the Executive to contribute, have vied with each other\r\nin their subscriptions to purposes of British interests in response to\r\ncalls of humanity, or munificence for objects but indistinctly heard of\r\nat the distance of half the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dominion of Canada has been so much talked about that it may be well\r\nto give a summary of its Constitution, though, in so far as regards its\r\nrelations to the mother country, it differs in no material respect from\r\nany other self-governing colony. The Dominion consists of seven\r\nprovinces, each of which has a Legislature of its own, but is at the\r\nsame time subject to the Legislature of the Dominion, in the same manner\r\nas each State in the American Union has a Legislature of its own, and is\r\nat the same time subject to the control of Congress. The distinguishing\r\nfeature between the system of the American States and the associated\r\ncolonies of the Dominion of Canada is this--that all Imperial powers,\r\neverything that constitutes a people a nation as respects foreigners,\r\nare reserved to the mother country. The division, then, of the Dominion\r\nand its provinces consists only in a division of Local powers. It is\r\nimpossible to mark accurately the line between Dominion and Provincial\r\npowers, but, speaking generally, Dominion powers relate to such\r\nmatters--for example, the regulation of trade and commerce, postal\r\nservice, currency, and so forth--as require to be dealt with on a\r\nuniform principle throughout the whole area of a country; while the\r\nProvincial powers relate to provincial and municipal institutions,\r\nprovincial licensing, and other subjects restricted to the limits of the\r\nprovince. As a general rule, the Legislature of the Dominion and the\r\nLegislature of each province have respectively exclusive jurisdiction\r\nwithin the limits of the subjects entrusted to them; but, as respects\r\nagriculture and immigration, the Dominion Parliament have power to\r\noverrule any Act of the provincial Legislatures, and, as respects\r\nproperty and civil rights in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick,\r\nthe Dominion Parliament may legislate with a view to uniformity, but\r\ntheir legislation is not valid unless it is accepted by the Legislature\r\nof each province to which it applies.\r\n\r\nThe executive authority in the Dominion Government, as in all the\r\nself-governing colonies, is carried on by the Governor in the name of\r\nthe Queen, but with the advice of a Council: that is to say, as to all\r\nImperial matters, he is under the control of the mother country; as to\r\nall local matters, he acts on the advice of his local Council. The\r\nresult of the whole is that the citizenship of an inhabitant of the\r\nDominion of Canada is a triple tie. Suppose him to reside in the\r\nprovince of Quebec. First, he is a citizen of that province, and bound\r\nto obey all the laws which it is within the competence of the provincial\r\nLegislature to pass. Next, he is a citizen of the Dominion of Canada,\r\nand acknowledges its jurisdiction in all matters outside the legitimate\r\nsphere of the province. Lastly, and above all, he is a subject of her\r\nMajesty. He is to all intents and purposes, as respects the vast company\r\nof nations, an Englishman, entitled to all the privileges as he is to\r\nall the glory of the mother country so far as such privileges can be\r\nenjoyed and glory participated in without actual residence in England.\r\nOne startling point of likeness in events and unlikeness in consequences\r\nis to be found in the history of Ireland and Canada. In 1798 Ireland\r\nrebelled. Protestant and Catholic were arrayed in arms against each\r\nother. The rebellion was quenched in blood, and measures of repression\r\nhave been in force, with slight intervals of suspension, ever since,\r\nwith this result--that the Ireland of 1886 is scarcely less disloyal and\r\ndiscontented than the Ireland of 1798. In 1837 and 1838 Canada rebelled.\r\nProtestants and Catholics, differing in nationality as well as in\r\nreligion, were arrayed in arms against each other. The rebellion was\r\nquelled with the least possible violence, a free Constitution was given,\r\nand the Canada of 1886 is the largest, most loyal, and most contented\r\ncolony in her Majesty's dominions.\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, thus much to be proved by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates that national unity of the closest description is consistent with\r\ncomplete Home Rule in the component members of the nation, and by the\r\nhistory of Canada and the British colonial empire that an Imperial tie\r\nis sufficient to bind together for centuries dependencies differing in\r\nsituation, in nationality, in religion, in laws, in everything that\r\ndistinguishes peoples one from another, and further and more\r\nparticularly that emancipation of the Anglo-Saxon colonies from control\r\nin their internal affairs strengthens instead of weakening Imperial\r\nunity, let us turn to Ireland and inquire whether there is anything in\r\nthe circumstances under which Home Rule was proposed to be granted to\r\nIreland, or in the measures intended to establish that Home Rule, fairly\r\nleading to the inference that disruption of the Empire or an impairment\r\nof Imperial powers would probably be a consequence of passing the Irish\r\nGovernment Bill and the Irish Land Bill. And, first, as to the\r\ncircumstances which would seem to recommend the Irish Home Rule Bill.\r\n\r\nIreland, from the very commencement of her connection with England, has\r\nchafed under the restraints which that connection imposed. The closer\r\nthe apparent union between the two countries the greater the real\r\ndisunion. The Act of 1800, _in words and in law_, effected not a union\r\nmerely, but a consolidation of the two countries. The effect of those\r\nwords and that law was to give rise to a restless discontent, which has\r\nconstantly found expression in efforts to procure the repeal of the Act\r\nof Union and the reestablishment of a National Parliament in Dublin. How\r\nfutile have been the efforts of the British Parliament to diminish by\r\nconcession or repress by coercion Irish aspirations or Irish discontent\r\nit is unnecessary to discuss here. All men admit the facts, however\r\ndifferent the conclusions which they draw from those facts. What Burke\r\nsaid of America on moving in 1775 his resolution on conciliation with\r\nthe colonies was true in 1885 with respect to Ireland:--\r\n\r\n\"The fact is undoubted, that under former Parliaments the state of\r\nAmerica [read for America, Ireland] has been kept in continual\r\nagitation. Everything administered as remedy to the public complaint, if\r\nit did not produce, was at least followed by an heightening of the\r\ndistemper, until, by a variety of experiments, that important country\r\nhas been brought into her present situation--a situation which I will\r\nnot miscall, which I dare not name, which I scarcely know how to\r\ncomprehend in the terms of any description.\"[12]\r\n\r\nAt length, after the election of 1885, Mr. Gladstone and the majority of\r\nhis followers came to the conclusion that an opportunity had presented\r\nitself for providing Ireland with a Constitution conferring on the\r\npeople of that country the largest measure of self-government consistent\r\nwith the absolute supremacy of the Crown and the Imperial Parliament and\r\nthe entire unity of the Empire. A scheme was proposed which was accepted\r\nin principle by the representatives of the National party in Ireland as\r\na fair and sufficient adjustment of the Imperial claims of Great Britain\r\nand the Local claims of Ireland. The scheme was shortly this. A\r\nLegislative Assembly was proposed to be established in Ireland with\r\npower to make all laws necessary for the good government of Ireland--in\r\nother words, invested with the same powers of local self-government as a\r\ncolonial Assembly. The Irish Assembly was in one respect unlike a\r\ncolonial Legislature. It consisted of one House only, but this House was\r\ndivided into two orders, each of which, in case of differences on any\r\nimportant legislative matter, voted separately. This form was adopted in\r\norder to minimize the chances of collision between the two orders, by\r\nmaking it imperative on each order to hear the arguments of the other\r\nbefore proceeding to a division, thus throwing on the dissentient order\r\nthe full responsibility of its dissent, with a complete knowledge of the\r\nconsequences likely to ensue therefrom. The clause conferring on the\r\nIrish Legislature full powers of local self-government was immediately\r\nfollowed by a provision excepting, by enumeration, from any interference\r\non the part of the Irish Legislature, all Imperial powers, and declaring\r\nany enactment void which infringed on that provision. This exception (as\r\nis well known) is not found in colonial Constitutional Acts. In them the\r\nrestriction of the words of the grant to Local powers only has been\r\nheld sufficient to safeguard the supremacy of the British Parliament and\r\nthe unity of the Empire. The reason for making a difference in the case\r\nof the Home Rule Bill was political, not legal. Separation was declared\r\nby the enemies of the Bill to be the real intention of its supporters,\r\nand destruction of the unity of the Empire to be its certain\r\nconsequence. It seemed well that Ireland, by her representatives, should\r\naccept as a satisfactory charter of Irish liberty a document which\r\ncontained an express submission to Imperial power and a direct\r\nacknowledgment of Imperial unity. Similarly with respect to the\r\nsupremacy of the British Parliament. In the colonial Constitutions all\r\nreference to this supremacy is omitted as being too clear to require\r\nnotice. In the case of the Irish Home Rule Bill instructions were given\r\nto preserve in express words the supremacy of the British Parliament in\r\norder to pledge Ireland to an express admission of that supremacy by the\r\nsame vote which accepted Local powers. It is true that the wording by\r\nthe draftsman of the sentence reserving the supremacy of Parliament was\r\njustly found fault with as inaccurate and doubtful, but that defect\r\nwould have been cured by an amendment in Committee; and, even if there\r\nhad not been any such clause in the Bill, it is clear, from what has\r\nbeen said above, that the Imperial Legislature could not, if it would,\r\nrenounce its supremacy or abdicate its sovereign powers. The executive\r\ngovernment in Ireland was continued in the Queen, to be carried on by\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant on behalf of her Majesty, with the aid of such\r\nofficers and Council as to her Majesty might from time to time seem fit.\r\nHer Majesty was also a constituent part of the Legislature, with power\r\nto delegate to the Lord Lieutenant the prerogative of assenting to or\r\ndissenting from Bills, and of summoning, proroguing, and dissolving\r\nParliament. Under these provisions the Lord Lieutenant resembled the\r\nGovernor of a colony with responsible government. He was invested with a\r\ndouble authority--first, Imperial; secondly, Local. As an Imperial\r\nofficer, he was bound to veto any Bill injuriously affecting Imperial\r\ninterests or inconsistent with general Imperial policy; as a Local\r\nofficer, it was his duty to act in all local matters according to the\r\nadvice of his Council, whose tenure of office depended on their being in\r\nharmony with, and supported by, a majority of the Legislative Assembly.\r\nQuestions relating to the constitutionality of any particular law were\r\nnot left altogether to the decision of the Governor. If a Bill\r\ncontaining a provision infringing Imperial rights passed the\r\nLegislature, its validity might be decided in the first instance by the\r\nordinary courts of law, but the ultimate appeal lay to the Judicial\r\nCommittee of the Privy Council, and, with a view to secure absolute\r\nimpartiality in the Committee, it was provided that Ireland should be\r\nrepresented on that body by persons who either were or had been Irish\r\njudges. Not the least important provision of the Bill, as respects the\r\nmaintenance of Imperial interests, was the continuance of Imperial\r\ntaxation. The Customs and Excise duties were directed to be levied, as\r\nheretofore, in pursuance of the enactments of the Imperial Parliament,\r\nand were excepted from the control of the Irish Legislature, which had\r\nfull power, with that exception, to impose such taxes in Ireland as they\r\nmight think expedient. The Bill further provided that neither the\r\nImperial taxes of Excise nor any Local taxes that might be imposed by\r\nthe Irish Legislature should be paid into the Irish Exchequer. An\r\nImperial officer, called the Receiver-General, was appointed, into whose\r\nhands the produce of every tax, both Imperial and Local, was required to\r\nbe paid, and it was the duty of the Receiver-General to take care that\r\nall claims of the English Exchequer, including especially the\r\ncontribution payable by Ireland for Imperial purposes, were satisfied\r\nbefore a farthing found its way into the Irish Exchequer for Irish\r\npurposes. The Receiver-General was provided with an Imperial Court to\r\nenforce his rights of Imperial taxation, and adequate means for\r\nenforcing all Imperial powers by Imperial civil officers. The Bill did\r\nnot provide for the representation of Ireland in the Imperial Parliament\r\non all Imperial questions, including questions relating to Imperial\r\ntaxation, but it is fully understood that in any Bill which might\r\nhereafter be brought forward relating to Home Rule those defects would\r\nbe remedied.\r\n\r\nAn examination, then, of the Home Rule Bill, that \"child of revolution\r\nand parent of separation,\" appears to lead irresistibly to two\r\nconclusions. First, that Imperial rights and Imperial powers,\r\nrepresentation for Imperial purposes, Imperial taxation--in short, every\r\nlink that binds a subordinate member of an Empire to its supreme\r\nhead--have been maintained unimpaired and unchanged. Secondly, that, in\r\ngranting Home Rule to discontented Ireland, that form of responsible\r\ngovernment has been adopted which, as Mr. Merivale declares--and his\r\ndeclaration subsequent events have more than verified--when conferred on\r\nthe discontented colonies, changed restless aspirations for separation\r\ninto quiet loyalty.\r\n\r\nThat such a Bill as the Home Rule Bill should be treated as an invasion\r\nof Imperial rights is a proof of one, or perhaps of both, the following\r\naxioms--that Bills are never read by their accusers, and that party\r\nspirit will distort the plainest facts. The union of Great Britain and\r\nIreland was not, so far as Imperial powers were concerned, disturbed by\r\nthe Bill, and an Irishman remains a citizen of the British Empire under\r\nthe Home Rule Bill, with the same obligations and the same privileges,\r\non the same terms as before. All the Bill did was to make his Irish\r\ncitizenship distinct from his Imperial citizenship, in the same manner\r\nas the citizenship of a native of the State of New York is distinct\r\nfrom his citizenship as a member of the United States. Now it has been\r\nfound that the Central power in the United States has been more than a\r\nmatch for the State powers, and can it be conceived for a moment that\r\nthe Imperial power of Great Britain should not be a match for the Local\r\npower of Ireland--a State which has not one-seventh of the population or\r\none-twentieth part of the income of the dominant community?\r\n\r\nOne argument remains to be noticed which the opponents of Home Rule urge\r\nas absolutely condemnatory of the measure, whereas, if properly weighed,\r\nit is conclusive in its favour. Home Rule, they say, is a mere question\r\nof sentiment. \"National aspirations\" are the twaddle of English\r\nenthusiasts who know nothing of Ireland. What is really wanted is the\r\nreform of the Land Law. Settle the agrarian problem, and Home Rule may\r\nbe relegated to the place supposed to be paved with good intentions. The\r\nIrish will straightway change their character, and become a law-abiding,\r\ncontented, loyal people. Be it so. But suppose it to be proved that the\r\nestablishment of an Irish Government, or, in other words, Home Rule, is\r\nan essential condition of agrarian reform--that the latter cannot be had\r\nwithout the former--surely Home Rule should stand none the worse in the\r\nestimation of its opponents if it not only secures a safe basis for\r\nputting an end to agrarian exasperation, but also gratifies the feeling\r\nof the Irish people as expressed by the majority of its representatives\r\nin Parliament? Now, what is the nature of the Irish Land Question? This\r\nwe must understand before considering the remedy. In Ireland (meaning by\r\nIreland that part of the country which is in the hands of tenants, and\r\nfalls within the compass of a Land Bill) the tenure of land is wholly\r\nunlike that which is found in the greater part of England. Instead of\r\nlarge farms in which the landlord makes all the improvements and the\r\ntenant pays rent for the privilege of cultivating the land and receives\r\nthe produce, small holdings are found in which the tenant does the\r\nimprovements (if any) and pays a fixed rent-charge to the owner. In\r\nEngland the tenant does not perform the obligations or in any way aspire\r\nto the character of owner. If he thinks he can get a cheaper farm, he\r\nquits his former one, regarding his interest in the land as a mere\r\nmatter of pounds, shillings, and pence. Not so the Irish tenant. He has\r\nmade what he calls improvements, he claims a quasi-ownership in the\r\nland, and has the characteristic Celtic attachment for the patch of\r\nground forming his holding, however squalid it may be, however\r\ninadequate for his support. In short, in Ireland there is a dual\r\nownership--that of the proprietor, who has no interest in the soil so\r\nlong as the tenant pays his rent and fulfils the conditions of his\r\ntenancy; and that of the tenant, who, subject to the payment of his rent\r\nand performance of the fixed conditions, acts, thinks, and carries\r\nhimself as the owner of his holding. A system, then, of agrarian reform\r\nin Ireland resolves itself into an inquiry as to the best mode of\r\nputting an end to this dual ownership--that is to say, of making the\r\ntenant the sole proprietor of his holding, and compensating the landlord\r\nfor his interest in the ownership. The problem is further narrowed by\r\nthe circumstance that the tenant cannot be expected to advance any\r\ncapital or pay an increased rent, so that the means of compensating the\r\nlandlord must be found out of the existing rent.\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted in Mr. Gladstone's Land Bill was to commute the\r\nrent-charges, offering the landlord, as a general rule, twenty years'\r\npurchase on the net rental of the estate (that is to say, the rent\r\nreceived by him after deducting all outgoings), and paying him the\r\npurchase-money in £3 per cent. stock taken at par. The stock was to be\r\nadvanced by the English Government to an Irish State department at 3-1/8\r\nper cent. interest, and the Bill provided that the tenant, instead of\r\nrent, was to pay an annuity of £4 per cent. on a capital sum equal in\r\namount to twenty times the gross rental.\r\n\r\nThe notable feature which distinguished this plan from all other schemes\r\nwas the security given for the repayment of the purchase-money: hitherto\r\nthe English Government has lent the money directly to the landlord or\r\ntenant, and has become the mortgagee of the land--in other words, has\r\nbecome in effect the landlord of the land sold to the tenant until the\r\nrepayment of the loan has been completed. To carry into effect under\r\nsuch a system any extensive scheme of agrarian reform (and if not\r\nextensive such a reform would be of no value in pacifying Ireland)\r\npresupposes a readiness on the part of the English Government to become\r\nvirtually the landlord of a large portion of Ireland, with the attendant\r\nodium of absenteeism and alien domination. Under a land scheme such as\r\nthat of 1886, all these difficulties would be overcome. The Irish, not\r\nthe English, Government would be the virtual landlord. It would be the\r\ninterest of Ireland that the annuities due from the tenants should be\r\nregularly paid, as, subject to the prior charge of the English\r\nExchequer, they would form part of the Irish revenues. The cardinal\r\ndifference, then, between Mr. Gladstone's scheme and any other land\r\nscheme that has seen the light is this--that in Mr. Gladstone's scheme\r\nthe English loans would have been lent to the Irish Government on the\r\nsecurity of the whole Irish revenues, whereas in every other scheme they\r\nhave been lent by the English Government to the Irish creditors on the\r\nsecurity of individual patches of land.\r\n\r\nThe whole question, then, of the relation between Home Rule and agrarian\r\nreform may be summed up as follows:--Agrarian reform is necessary for\r\nthe pacification of Ireland; agrarian reform cannot be efficiently\r\ncarried into effect without an Irish Government; an Irish Government can\r\nonly be established by a Home Rule Bill: therefore a Home Rule Bill is\r\nnecessary for the pacification of Ireland. It is idle to say, as has\r\nbeen said on numerous platforms, that plans no doubt can be devised for\r\nagrarian reform without Home Rule. The Irish revenues are the only\r\ncollateral security that can be obtained for loans of English money, and\r\nIrish revenues are only available for the purpose on the establishment\r\nof an Irish Government. Baronial guarantees, union guarantees, county\r\nguarantees, debenture schemes, have all been tried and found wanting,\r\nand vague assertions as to possibilities are idle unless they are based\r\non intelligible working plans.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing arguments will be equally valid if, instead of making the\r\ntenants peasant-proprietors, it were thought desirable that the Irish\r\nState should be the proprietor and the tenants be the holders of the\r\nland at perpetual rents and subject to fixed conditions. Again, it might\r\nbe possible to pay the landlords by annual sums instead of capital sums.\r\nSuch matters are really questions of detail. The substance is to\r\ninterpose the Irish Government between the tenant and the English\r\nmortgagee, and to make the loans general charges on the whole of the\r\nIrish Government revenues as paid into the hands of an Imperial Receiver\r\ninstead of placing them as special charges, each fixed on its own small\r\nestate or holding. The fact that Mr. Gladstone's land scheme was\r\ndenounced as confiscation of £100,000,000 of the English taxpayers'\r\nproperty, while Lord Ashbourne's Act is pronounced by the same party\r\nwise and prudent, shows the political blindness of party spirit in its\r\nmost absurd form. Lord Ashbourne's Act requires precisely the same\r\nexpenditure to do the same work as Mr. Gladstone's Bill requires, but in\r\nMr. Gladstone's scheme the whole Irish revenue was pledged as collateral\r\nsecurity, and the Irish Government was interposed between the ultimate\r\ncreditor and the Irish tenant, while under Lord Ashbourne's Act the\r\nEnglish Government figures without disguise as the landlord of each\r\ntenant, exacting a debt which the tenant is unwilling to pay as being\r\ndue to what he calls an alien Government.\r\n\r\nAn endeavour has been made in the preceding pages to prove that Home\r\nRule in no respect infringes on Imperial rights or Imperial unity, for\r\nthe simple reason that the Imperial power remains exactly in the same\r\nposition as it was before, the Home Rule Bill dealing only with Local\r\nmatters. At all events, Burke thought that the Imperial supremacy alone\r\nconstituted a real union between England and Ireland. He says--\r\n\r\n\"My poor opinion is, that the closest connection between Great Britain\r\nand Ireland is essential to the well-being--I had almost said to the\r\nvery being--of the three kingdoms; for that purpose I humbly conceive\r\nthat the whole of the superior, and what I should call Imperial\r\npolitics, ought to have its residence here, and that Ireland, locally,\r\ncivilly, and commercially independent, ought politically to look up to\r\nGreat Britain in all matters of peace and war. In all these points to be\r\njoined with her, and, in a word, with her to live and to die.\"[13]\r\n\r\nHow strange to Burke would have seemed the doctrine that the restoration\r\nof a limited power of self-government to Ireland, excluding commerce,\r\nand excluding all matters not only Imperial, but those in which\r\nuniformity is required, should be denounced as a disruption of the\r\nEmpire!\r\n\r\nIt remains to notice one other charge made against the Gladstonian Home\r\nRule Bill, namely, that of impairing the supremacy of the British\r\nParliament. That allegation has been shown also to be founded on a\r\nmistake. Next, it is said that the Gladstonian scheme does not provide\r\nsecurities against executive and legislative oppression. The answer is\r\ncomplete. The executive authority being vested in the Queen, it will be\r\nthe duty of the Governor not to allow executive oppression; still more\r\nwill it be his duty to veto any act of legislative oppression. Further,\r\nit is stated that difficulties will arise with respect to the power of\r\nthe Privy Council to nullify unconstitutional Acts. But it is hard to\r\nsee why a power which is exercised with success in the United States,\r\nwhere all the States are equal, and without dispute in our colonies,\r\nwhich are all dependent, should not be carried into effect with equal\r\nease in Ireland, which is more closely bound to us and more completely\r\nunder our power than the colonies are, or than the several States are\r\nunder the power of the Central Government.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: the cause of Irish discontent is the conjoint operation of\r\nthe passion for nationality and the vicious system of land tenure, and\r\nthe scheme of the Irish Home Rule Bill and the Land Bill removes the\r\nwhole fabric on which Irish discontent is raised. The Irish, by the\r\ngreat majority of their representatives, have accepted the Home Rule\r\nBill as a satisfactory settlement of the nationality question. The\r\nBritish Parliament can, through the medium of the Home Rule Bill and the\r\nestablishment of an Irish Legislature, carry through a final settlement\r\nof agrarian disputes with less injustice to individuals than could a\r\nParliament sitting in Dublin, and, be it added, with scarcely any\r\nappreciable risk to the British taxpayer. Of course it may be said that\r\nan Irish Parliament will go farther--that Home Rule is a step to\r\nseparation, and a reform of the Land Laws a spoliation of the landlords.\r\nTo those who urge such arguments I would recommend the perusal of the\r\nspeech of Burke on Conciliation with America, and especially the\r\nfollowing sentences, substituting \"Ireland\" for \"the colonies:\"--\r\n\r\n\"But [the Colonies] Ireland will go further. Alas! alas! when will this\r\nspeculating against fact and reason end? What will quiet these panic\r\nfears which we entertain of the hostile effect of a conciliatory\r\nconduct? Is it true that no case can exist in which it is proper for the\r\nSovereign to accede to the desires of his discontented subjects? Is\r\nthere anything peculiar in this case to make it a rule for itself? Is\r\nall authority of course lost when it is not pushed to the extreme? Is it\r\na certain maxim that the fewer causes of discontentment are left by\r\nGovernment the more the subject will be inclined to resist and rebel?\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Burke's Speech on American Taxation, vol. i. p. 174]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: This is the opinion of both English and American lawyers.\r\nSee Blackstone's Comm., i. 90; Austin on Jurisprudence, i. 226.

It is, therefore,\r\nproposed in the following pages, before entering on the details of each\r\nBill, to give a summary of the reasons which led to its introduction,\r\nand of the principles on which it is founded. To begin with the Irish\r\nGovernment Bill--\r\n\r\nThe object of the Irish Government Bill is to confer on the Irish people\r\nthe largest measure of self-government consistent with the absolute\r\nsupremacy of the Crown and Imperial Parliament and the entire unity of\r\nthe Empire. To carry into effect this object it was essential to create\r\na separate though subordinate legislature; thus occasion was given to\r\nopponents to apply the name of Separatists to the supporters of the\r\nBill--a term true in so far only as it denoted the intention to create a\r\nseparate legislature, but false and calumnious when used in the sense in\r\nwhich it was intended to be understood--of imputing to the promoters of\r\nthe Bill the intention to disunite or in any way to disintegrate the\r\nEmpire. Indeed, the very object of the measure was, by relaxing a little\r\nthe legal bonds of union, to draw closer the actual ties between England\r\nand Ireland, in fact, to do as we have done in our Colonies, by\r\ndecentralizing the subordinate functions of government to strengthen the\r\ncentral supremacy of natural affection and Imperial unity. The example\r\nof the effects of giving complete self-government to our Colonies would\r\nseem not unfavourable to trying the same experiment in Ireland. Some\r\nforty years ago, Canada, New Zealand, and the various colonies of\r\nAustralia were discontented and uneasy at the control exercised by the\r\nGovernment of England over their local affairs. What did England do? She\r\ngave to each of those communities the fullest power of local government\r\nconsistent with the unity of the Empire. The result was that the real\r\nunion was established in the same degree as the apparent tie of control\r\nover local affairs was loosened. Are there any reasons to suppose that\r\nthe condition of Ireland is such as to render the example of the\r\nColonies applicable? Let us look a little at the past history of that\r\ncountry. Up to 1760 Ireland was governed practically as a conquered\r\ncountry. The result was that in 1782, in order to save Imperial unity,\r\nwe altogether relaxed the local tie and made Ireland legislatively\r\nindependent. The Empire was thus saved, but difficulties naturally arose\r\nbetween two independent legislatures. The true remedy would have been to\r\nhave imposed on Grattan's Parliament the conditions imposed by the Irish\r\nGovernment Bill on the statutory Parliament created by that Bill; the\r\ncourse actually taken was that, instead of leaving the Irish with their\r\nlocal government, and arranging for the due supremacy of England, the\r\nIrish Legislature was destroyed under the guise of Union, and Irish\r\nrepresentatives were transferred to an assembly in which they had little\r\nweight, and in which they found no sympathy. The result was that from\r\nthe date of the Union to the present day Ireland has been constantly\r\nworking for the reinstatement of its National Legislature, and has been\r\ngoverned by a continuous system of extraordinary legislature called\r\ncoercion; the fact being that between 1800, the date of the Act of\r\nUnion, and 1832, the date of the great Reform Act, there were only\r\neleven years free from coercion, while in the fifty-three years since\r\nthat period there have been only two years entirely free from special\r\nrepressive legislation. So much, therefore, is clear, that Irish\r\ndiscontent at not being allowed to manage their own affairs has\r\ngradually increased instead of diminishing. The conclusion then would\r\nseem irresistible, that if coercion has failed, the only practical mode\r\nof governing Ireland satisfactorily is to give the people power to\r\nmanage their local affairs. Coming, then, to the principle of the Bill,\r\nthe first step is to reconcile local government with Imperial supremacy,\r\nin other words, to divide Imperial from local powers; for if this\r\ndivision be accurately made, and the former class of powers be reserved\r\nto the British Crown and British Parliament, while the latter only are\r\nintrusted to the Irish Parliament, it becomes a contradiction in terms\r\nto say that Imperial unity is dissolved by reserving to the Imperial\r\nauthority all its powers, or that Home Rule is a sundering of the\r\nImperial tie when that tie is preserved inviolable. Imperial powers,\r\nthen, are the prerogatives of the Crown with respect to peace and war,\r\nand making treaties with foreign nations; in short, the power of\r\nregulating the relations of the Empire towards foreign nations. These\r\nare the _jura summi imperii_, the very insignia of supremacy; the\r\nattributes of sovereign authority in every form of government, be it\r\ndespotism, limited monarchy, or republic; the only difference is that in\r\na system of government under one supreme head, they are vested in that\r\nhead alone, in a federal government, as in America or Switzerland, they\r\nreside in the composite body forming the federal supreme authority.\r\nVarious subsidiary powers necessarily attend the above supreme powers;\r\nfor example, the power of maintaining armies and navies, of commanding\r\nthe militia, and other incidental powers. Closely connected with the\r\npower of making peace and war is the power of regulating commerce with\r\nforeign nations. Next in importance to the reservations necessary to\r\nconstitute the Empire a Unity with regard to foreign nations, are the\r\npowers required to prevent disputes and to facilitate intercourse\r\nbetween the various parts of the Empire. These are the coinage of money\r\nand other regulations relating to currency, to copyright or other\r\nexclusive rights to the use or profit of any works or inventions. The\r\nabove subjects must be altogether excluded from the powers of the\r\nsubordinate legislature; it ceases to be subordinate as soon as it is\r\ninvested with these Imperial, or quasi-Imperial, powers.\r\n\r\nAssuming, however, the division between Imperial and local powers to be\r\naccurately determined, how is the subordinate legislative body to be\r\nkept within its due limits? The answer is very plain,--an Imperial court\r\nmust be established to decide in the last resort whether the subordinate\r\nlegislature has or has not infringed Imperial rights. Such a court has\r\nbeen in action in the United States of America ever since their union,\r\nand no serious conflict has arisen in carrying its decisions into\r\neffect, and the Privy Council, acting as the Supreme Court in respect to\r\nColonial appeals, has been accepted by all the self-governing colonies\r\nas a just and impartial expositor of the meaning of their several\r\nconstitutions.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the right division of Imperial and local powers is\r\na correct understanding of the relation borne by the executive of an\r\nautonomous country to the mother country. In every part of the British\r\nEmpire which enjoys home rule the legislature consists of the Queen and\r\nthe two local legislative bodies. The administrative power resides in\r\nthe Queen alone. The Queen has the appointment of all the officers of\r\nthe government; money bills can be introduced into the legislature only\r\nwith the consent of the Queen. The initiative power of taxation then is\r\nvested in the Queen, the executive head, in practice represented by the\r\nGovernor. But such a power of initiation is of course useless unless the\r\nlegislative body is willing to support the executive, and grants it the\r\nnecessary funds for carrying on the government. What, then, is the\r\ncontrivance by which the governmental machine is prevented from being\r\nstopped by a difference between the executive and legislative\r\nauthorities? It is the same in the mother country, and in every British\r\nhome-rule country, with this difference only--that beyond the limits of\r\nthe mother country the Queen is represented by a governor to whom are\r\ndelegated such a measure of powers as is necessary for the supreme head\r\nof a local self-governing community. The contrivance is this in the\r\nmother country:--the Queen acts upon the advice of a cabinet council; in\r\nhome-rule dependencies the Governor acts on the advice of a local\r\ncouncil. If this cabinet council in the mother country, or local council\r\nin a dependency, ceases to command a majority in the popular legislative\r\nbody, it resigns, and the Governor is obliged to select a council which,\r\nby commanding such a majority, can obtain the supplies necessary to\r\ncarry on the government. The consequence then is, that in a home-rule\r\ncommunity, if a serious difficulty arises between the legislative and\r\nexecutive authority, the head of the executive, the governor, refers the\r\nultimate decision of the question to the general body of electors by\r\ndissolving the popular legislative body. It has been urged in the\r\ndiscussion on the Irish Government Bill that the powers of the executive\r\nin relation to the legislative body ought to be expressed in the Bill\r\nitself; but it is clear to anybody acquainted with the rudiments of\r\nlegislation that the details of such a system (in other words, the mode\r\nin which a governor ought to act under the endless variety of\r\ncircumstances which may occur in governing a dependency) never have been\r\nand never can be expressed in an Act of Parliament. But how little\r\ndifficulty this absence of definition has caused may be judged from the\r\nfact that neither in England nor in any of her home-rule dependencies\r\nhas any vital collision arisen between the executive and legislative\r\nauthorities, and that all the home-rule colonies have managed to\r\nsurmount the obstacles which the opponents of Home Rule argued would be\r\nfatal to their existence. The main principles have now been stated on\r\nwhich the Irish Government Bill is framed, and it remains to give a\r\nsummary of the provisions of the Bill, the objects and bearing of which\r\nwill be readily understood from the foregoing observations. The first\r\nclause provides that--\r\n\r\n\"On and after the appointed day there shall be established in Ireland a\r\nLegislature consisting of Her Majesty the Queen and an Irish legislative\r\nbody.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the first step in all English constitutional systems, to vest\r\nthe power of legislation in the Queen and the legislative body. Such a\r\nlegislature might have had conferred on it the independent powers vested\r\nin Grattan's Parliament: but the second clause at once puts an end to\r\nany doubt as to the subordination of the Irish legislative body; for\r\nwhile on the one hand it confers full powers of local self-government,\r\nby declaring that the Legislature may make any laws for the peace,\r\norder, and good government of Ireland, it subjects that power to\r\nnumerous exceptions and restrictions. The exceptions are contained in\r\nthe third clause, and the restrictions in the fourth. The exceptions are\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The Legislature of Ireland shall not make laws relating to the\r\nfollowing matters or any of them:--\r\n\r\n\"(1.) The status or dignity of the Crown, or the succession to the\r\nCrown, or a Regency;\r\n\r\n\"(2.) The making of peace or war;\r\n\r\n\"(3.) The army, navy, militia, volunteers, or other military or naval\r\nforces, or the defence of the realm;\r\n\r\n\"(4.) Treaties and other relations with foreign States, or the\r\nrelations between the various parts of Her Majesty's dominions;\r\n\r\n\"(5.) Dignities or titles of honour;\r\n\r\n\"(6.) Prize or booty of war;\r\n\r\n\"(7.) Offences against the law of nations; or offences committed in\r\nviolation of any treaty made, or hereafter to be made, between Her\r\nMajesty and any foreign State; or offences committed on the high seas;\r\n\r\n\"(8.) Treason, alienage, or naturalization;\r\n\r\n\"(9.) Trade, navigation, or quarantine;\r\n\r\n\"(10.) The postal and telegraph service, except as hereafter in this Act\r\nmentioned with respect to the transmission of letters and telegrams in\r\nIreland;\r\n\r\n\"(11.) Beacons, lighthouses, or sea-marks;\r\n\r\n\"(12.) The coinage; the value of foreign money; legal tender; or weights\r\nand measures; or\r\n\r\n\"(13.) Copyright, patent rights, or other exclusive rights to the use or\r\nprofits of any works or inventions.\"\r\n\r\nOf these exceptions the first four preserve the imperial rights which\r\nhave been insisted on above, and maintain the position of Ireland as an\r\nintegral portion of that Empire of which Great Britain is the head. The\r\nremaining exceptions are either subsidiary to the first four, or relate,\r\nas is the case with exceptions 10 to 13, to matters on which it is\r\ndesirable that uniformity should exist throughout the whole Empire. The\r\nrestrictions in clause 4 are:--\r\n\r\n\"The Irish Legislature shall not make any law--\r\n\r\n\"(1.) Respecting the establishment or endowment of religion, or\r\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or\r\n\r\n\"(2.) Imposing any disability, or conferring any privilege, on account\r\nof religious belief; or\r\n\r\n\"(3.) Abrogating or derogating from the right to establish or maintain\r\nany place of denominational education or any denominational institution\r\nor charity; or\r\n\r\n\"(4.) Prejudicially affecting the right of any child to attend a school\r\nreceiving public money without attending the religious instruction at\r\nthat school; or\r\n\r\n\"(5.) Impairing, without either the leave of Her Majesty in Council\r\nfirst obtained on an address presented by the legislative body of\r\nIreland, or the consent of the corporation interested, the rights,\r\nproperty, or privileges of any existing corporation incorporated by\r\nroyal charter or local and general Act of Parliament; or\r\n\r\n\"(6.) Imposing or relating to duties of customs and duties of excise, as\r\ndefined by this Act, or either of such duties, or affecting any Act\r\nrelating to such duties or either of them; or\r\n\r\n\"(7.) Affecting this Act, except in so far as it is declared to be\r\nalterable by the Irish Legislature.\"\r\n\r\nThese restrictions differ from the exceptions, inasmuch as they do not\r\nprevent the Legislature of Ireland from dealing with the subjects to\r\nwhich they refer, but merely impose on it an obligation not to handle\r\nthe specified matters in a manner detrimental to the interests of\r\ncertain classes of Her Majesty's subjects. For example, restrictions 1\r\nto 4 are practically concerned in securing religious freedom;\r\nrestriction 5 protects existing charters; restriction 6 is necessary, as\r\nwill be seen hereinafter, to carrying into effect the financial scheme\r\nof the bill; restriction 7 is a consequence of the very framework of the\r\nBill: it provides for the stability of the Irish constitution, by\r\ndeclaring that the Irish Legislature is not competent to alter the\r\nconstitutional act to which it owes its existence, except on those\r\npoints on which it is expressly permitted to make alterations.\r\n\r\nClause 5 is an exposition, so to speak, of the consequence which would\r\nseem to flow from the fact of the Queen being a constitutional part of\r\nthe Legislature. It states that the royal prerogatives with respect to\r\nthe summoning, prorogation, and dissolution of the Irish legislative\r\nbody are to be the same as the royal prerogatives in relation to the\r\nImperial Parliament. The next clause (6) is comparatively immaterial;\r\nit merely provides that the duration of the Irish legislative body is to\r\nbe quinquennial. As it deals with a matter of detail, it perhaps would\r\nhave more aptly found a place in a subsequent part of the Bill. Clause 7\r\npasses from the legislative to the executive authority; it declares:--\r\n\r\n(1.) The executive government of Ireland shall continue vested in Her\r\nMajesty, and shall be carried on by the Lord Lieutenant on behalf of Her\r\nMajesty with the aid of such officers and such council as to Her Majesty\r\nmay from time to time seem fit.\r\n\r\n(2.) Subject to any instructions which may from time to time be given by\r\nHer Majesty, the Lord Lieutenant shall give or withhold the assent of\r\nHer Majesty to bills passed by the Irish legislative body, and shall\r\nexercise the prerogatives of Her Majesty in respect of the summoning,\r\nproroguing, and dissolving of the Irish legislative body, and any\r\nprerogatives the exercise of which may be delegated to him by Her\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind what has been said in the preliminary observations in\r\nrespect of the relation between the executive and the legislative\r\nauthority, it will be at once understood how much this clause implies,\r\naccording to constitutional maxims, of the dependence on the one hand of\r\nthe Irish executive in respect of imperial matters, and of its\r\nindependence in respect of local matters. The clause is practically\r\nco-ordinate and correlative with the clause conferring complete local\r\npowers on the Irish Legislature, while it preserves all imperial powers\r\nto the Imperial Legislature. The governor is an imperial officer, and\r\nwill be bound to watch over imperial interests with a jealous scrutiny,\r\nand to veto any bill which may be injurious to those interests. On the\r\nother hand, as respects all local matters, he will act on and be guided\r\nby the advice of the Irish executive council. The system is, as has been\r\nshown above, self-acting. The governor, for local purposes, must have a\r\ncouncil which is in harmony with the legislative body. If a council,\r\nsupported by the legislative body and the governor do not agree, the\r\ngovernor must give way unless he can, by dismissing his council and\r\ndissolving the legislative body, obtain both a council and a legislative\r\nbody which will support his views. As respects imperial questions, the\r\ncase is different; here the last word rests with the mother country, and\r\nin the last resort a determination of the executive council, backed by\r\nthe legislative body, to resist imperial rights, must be deemed an act\r\nof rebellion on the part of the Irish people, and be dealt with\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThe above clauses contain the pith and marrow of the whole scheme. The\r\nexact constitution of the legislative body, and the orders into which it\r\nshould be divided, the exclusion or non-exclusion of the Irish members\r\nfrom the Imperial Parliament, indeed, the whole of the provisions found\r\nin the remainder of this Bill, are matters which might be altered\r\nwithout destroying, or even violently disarranging, the Home-rule scheme\r\nas above described.\r\n\r\nClauses 9, 10, and 11 provide for the constitution of the legislative\r\nbody; it differs materially from the colonial legislative bodies, and\r\nfrom the Legislature of the United States. For the purpose of\r\ndeliberation it consists of one House only; for the purpose of voting on\r\nall questions (except interlocutory applications and questions of\r\norder), it is divided into two classes, called in the Bill \"Orders,\"\r\neach of which votes separately, with the result that a question on which\r\nthe two orders disagree is deemed to be decided in the negative. The\r\nobject of this arrangement is to diminish the chances of collision\r\nbetween the two branches of the Legislature, which have given rise to so\r\nmuch difficulty both in England and the colonies. Each order will have\r\nample opportunity of learning the strength and hearing the arguments of\r\nthe other order. They will therefore, each of them, proceed to a\r\ndivision with a full sense of the responsibility attaching to their\r\naction. A further safeguard is provided against a final conflict between\r\nthe first and second orders. If the first order negative a proposition,\r\nthat negative is in force only for a period of three years, unless a\r\ndissolution takes place sooner, in which case it is terminated at once;\r\nthe lost bill or clause may then be submitted to the whole House, and if\r\ndecided in the affirmative, and assented to by the Queen, becomes law.\r\nThe first order of the Irish legislative body comprises 103 members. It\r\nis intended to consist ultimately wholly of elective members; but for\r\nthe next immediate period of thirty years the rights of the Irish\r\nrepresentative peers are, as will be seen, scrupulously reserved. The\r\nplan is this: of the 103 members composing the first order, seventy-five\r\nare elective, and twenty-eight peerage members. The qualification of the\r\nelective members is an annual income of £200, or the possession of a\r\ncapital sum of £4000 free from all charges. The elections are to be\r\nconducted in the electoral districts set out in the schedule to the\r\nBill. The electors must possess land or tenements within the district of\r\nthe annual value of £25. The twenty-eight peerage members consist of the\r\nexisting twenty-eight representative peers, and any vacancies in their\r\nbody during the next thirty years are to be filled up in the manner at\r\npresent in use respecting the election of Irish representative peers.\r\nThe Irish representative peers cease to sit in the English Parliament;\r\nbut a member of that body is not required to sit in the Irish Parliament\r\nwithout his assent, and the place of any existing peer refusing to sit\r\nin the Irish Parliament will be filled up as in the case of an ordinary\r\nvacancy. The elective members of the first order sit for ten years;\r\nevery five years one half their number will retire. The members of the\r\nfirst order do not vacate their seats on a dissolution of the\r\nlegislative body. At the expiration of thirty years, that is to say,\r\nupon the exhaustion of all the existing Irish representative peers, the\r\nwhole of the upper order will consist of elective members. The second\r\norder consists of 204 members, that is to say, of the 103 existing Irish\r\nmembers (who are transferred to the Irish Parliament), and of 101\r\nadditional members to be elected by the county districts and the\r\nrepresented towns, in the same manner as that in which the present 101\r\nmembers for counties and towns are elected--each constituency returning\r\ntwo instead of one member. If an existing member does not assent to his\r\ntransfer, his seat is vacated.\r\n\r\nA power is given to the Legislature of Ireland to enable the Royal\r\nUniversity of Ireland to return two members.\r\n\r\nThe provisions with respect to this second order fall within the class\r\nof enactments which are alterable by the Irish Legislature. After the\r\nfirst dissolution of parliament the Irish Legislature may deal with the\r\nsecond order in any manner they think fit, with the important\r\nrestrictions:--(1) That in the distribution of members they must have\r\ndue regard to population; (2) that they must not increase or diminish\r\nthe number of members.\r\n\r\nThe transfer to the Irish legislative body of the Irish representative\r\npeers, and of the Irish members, involves their exclusion under ordinary\r\ncircumstances from the Imperial Parliament, with this great exception,\r\nthat whenever an alteration is proposed to be made in the fundamental\r\nprovisions of the Irish Government Bill, a mode of procedure is devised\r\nfor recalling both orders of the Irish legislative body to the Imperial\r\nParliament for the purpose of obtaining their consent to such alteration\r\n(clause 39).\r\n\r\nFurther, it is right to state here that Mr. Gladstone in his speech on\r\nthe second reading of the Bill proposed to provide, \"that when any\r\nproposal for taxation was made affecting the condition of Ireland, Irish\r\nmembers should have an opportunity of appearing in the House to take a\r\nshare in the transaction of that business.\"\r\n\r\nQuestions arising as to whether the Irish Parliament has or not\r\nexceeded its constitutional powers may be determined by the ordinary\r\ncourts of law in the first instance; the ultimate appeal lies to the\r\nJudicial Committee of the Privy Council. An additional safeguard is\r\nprovided by declaring that before a provision in a Bill becomes law, the\r\nLord Lieutenant may take the opinion of the Judicial Committee of the\r\nPrivy Council as to its legality, and further, that without subjecting\r\nprivate litigants to the expense of trying the constitutionality of an\r\nAct, the Lord Lieutenant may, of his own motion, move the judicial\r\ncommittee to determine the question. With a view to secure absolute\r\nimpartiality in the committee, Ireland will be represented on that body\r\nby persons who are or have been Irish judges (clause 25).\r\n\r\nThe question of finance forms a separate portion of the Bill, the\r\nprovisions of which are contained in clauses twelve to twenty, while the\r\nmachinery for carrying those enactments into effect will be found in\r\nPart III. of the Land Bill. The first point to be determined was the\r\namount to be contributed by Ireland to imperial expenses. Under the Act\r\nof Union it was intended that Ireland should pay 2/17ths, or in the\r\nproportion of 1 to 7-1/2 of the total expenditure of the United Kingdom.\r\nThis amount being found exorbitant, it was gradually reduced, until at\r\nthe present moment it amounts to something under the proportion of 1 to\r\n11-1/2. The bill fixes the proportion at 1/15th, or 1 to 14, this sum\r\nbeing arrived at by a comparison between the amount of the income-tax,\r\ndeath-duties, and valuation of property in Great Britain, and the amount\r\nof the same particulars in Ireland. The amount to be contributed by\r\nIreland to the imperial expenditure being thus ascertained, the more\r\ndifficult part of the problem remained to provide the fund out of which\r\nthe contribution should be payable, and the mode in which its payment\r\nshould be secured. The plan which commended itself to the framers of the\r\nBill, as combining the advantage of insuring the fiscal unity of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, with absolute security to the British exchequer,\r\nwas to continue the customs and excise duties under imperial control,\r\nand to pay them into the hands of an imperial officer. This plan is\r\ncarried into effect by the conjoint operation of the clauses of the\r\nIrish Government Bill and the Irish Land Bill above referred to. The\r\ncustoms and excise duties are directed to be levied as heretofore in\r\npursuance of the enactments of the Imperial Parliament, and are excepted\r\nfrom the control of the Irish Legislature, which may, with that\r\nexception, impose any taxes in Ireland it may think expedient. The\r\nimperial officer who is appointed under the Land Bill bears the title of\r\nReceiver-General, and into his hands not only the imperial taxes (the\r\ncustoms and excise duties), but also all local taxes imposed by the\r\nIrish Parliament are in the first instance paid. (See Clauses 25-27 of\r\nthe Land Bill.) The Receiver-General having thus in his hands all\r\nimperial and local funds levied in Ireland, his duty is to satisfy all\r\nimperial claims before paying over any moneys to the Irish Exchequer.\r\nFurther, an Imperial Court of Exchequer is established in Ireland to\r\nwatch over the interests of the Receiver-General, and all revenue cases\r\nare to be tried, and all defaults punished in that court. Any neglect of\r\nthe local authorities to carry into effect the decrees of the Imperial\r\nCourt will amount to treason, and it will be the duty of the Imperial\r\nGovernment to deal with it accordingly.\r\n\r\nSupposing the Bill to have passed, the account of the Exchequer in\r\nIreland would have stood thus:--\r\n\r\n                         RECEIPTS.\r\n\r\n1. _Imperial Taxes_:\r\n   (1) Customs . . . . . . . . . . £1,880,000\r\n   (2) Excise  . . . . . . . . . .  4,300,000\r\n                                    --------- £6,180,000\r\n\r\n2. _Local Taxes_:\r\n   (1) Stamps . . . . . . . . . . .   £600,000\r\n   (2) Income-Tax at 6_d_. in £ . .    550,000\r\n                                     --------- £1,150,000\r\n\r\n3. _Non-Tax Revenue_:\r\n   (Post Office, Telegraph, etc.) . . . . .    £1,020,000\r\n                                               ----------\r\n                                               £8,350,000\r\n\r\n                       EXPENDITURE.\r\n\r\n1. _Contribution to Imperial Exchequer_ on basis of\r\n     1/15th of Imperial Expenditure, viz.:\r\n   (1) Debt Charge . . . . . . . .  £1,466,000\r\n   (2) Army and Navy . . . . . . .   1,666,000\r\n   (3) Civil Charges . . . . . . .     110,000\r\n                                     --------- £3,242,000\r\n2. _Sinking Fund_ on 1/15th of\r\n      Capital of Debt . . . . . . . . . . . . .   360,000\r\n3. _Charge for Constabulary_[14]  . . . . . . . 1,000,000\r\n4. _Local Civil Charges_\r\n      other than Constabulary . . . . . . . . . 2,510,000\r\n5. _Collection of Revenue_:\r\n      (1) Imperial Taxes . . . . . .   £170,000\r\n      (2) Local Taxes  . . . . . . . .   60,000\r\n      (3) Non-Tax Revenue  . . . . . .  604,000\r\n                                        -------   834,000\r\n6. _Balance_ or Surplus . . . . . . . . . . . .   404,000\r\n                                                 --------\r\n                                               £8,350,000\r\n\r\nThe Imperial contribution payable by Ireland to Great Britain cannot be\r\nincreased for thirty years, though it may be diminished if the charges\r\nfor the army and navy and Imperial civil expenditure for any year be\r\nless than fifteen times the contribution paid by Ireland, in which case\r\n1/15th of the diminution will be deducted from the annual Imperial\r\ncontribution. Apart from the Imperial charges there are other charges\r\nstrictly Irish, for the security of the payment of which the Bill\r\nprovides. This it does by imposing an obligation on the Irish\r\nlegislative body to enact sufficient taxes to meet such charges, and by\r\ndirecting them to be paid by the Imperial Receiver-General, who is\r\nrequired to keep an imperial and an Irish account, carrying the customs\r\nand excise duties, in the first instance, to the imperial account, and\r\nthe local taxes to the Irish account, transferring to the Irish account\r\nthe surplus remaining after paying the imperial charges on the imperial\r\naccount. On this Irish account are charged debts due from the Government\r\nof Ireland, pensions, and other sums due to the civil servants, and the\r\nsalaries of the judges of the supreme courts in Ireland.\r\n\r\nSome provisions of importance remain to be noticed. Judges of the\r\nsuperior and county courts in Ireland are to be removable from office\r\nonly on address to the Crown, presented by both orders of the\r\nLegislative body voting separately. Existing Civil servants are retained\r\nin their offices at their existing salaries; if the Irish Government\r\ndesire their retirement, they will be entitled to pensions; on the other\r\nhand, if at the end of two years the officers themselves wish to retire,\r\nthey can do so, and will be entitled to the same pensions as if their\r\noffice had been abolished. The pensions are payable by the\r\nReceiver-General out of the Irish account above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe supremacy of the Imperial Parliament over all parts of the Empire is\r\nan inherent quality of which Parliament cannot divest itself, inasmuch\r\nas it cannot bind its successors or prevent them from repealing any\r\nprior Act. In order, however, to prevent any misapprehension on this\r\npoint clause 37 was inserted, the efficacy of which, owing in great\r\nmeasure to a misprint, has been doubted. It is enough to state here that\r\nit was intended by express legislation to reserve all powers to the\r\nImperial Parliament, and had the Bill gone into Committee the question\r\nwould have been placed beyond the reach of cavil by a slight alteration\r\nin the wording of the clause. This summary may be concluded by the\r\nstatement that the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords over\r\nactions and suits arising in Ireland (except in respect of\r\nconstitutional questions reserved for the determination of the Judicial\r\nCommittee of the Privy Council as explained above), and with respect to\r\nclaims for Irish Peerages, is preserved intact.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Land Bill was a political one: to promote the\r\ncontentment of the people, and the cause of good government in Ireland,\r\nby settling once and for ever the vexed question relating to land. To do\r\nthis effectually it was necessary to devise a system under which the\r\ntenants, as a class, should become interested in the maintenance of\r\nsocial order, and be furnished with substantial inducements to rally\r\nround the institutions of their country. On the other hand, it was just\r\nand right that the landlords should participate in the benefits of any\r\nmeasure proposed for remedying the evils attendant upon the tenure of\r\nland in Ireland; and should be enabled to rid themselves, on fair terms,\r\nof their estates in cases where, from apprehension of impending changes,\r\nor for pecuniary reasons, they were desirous of relieving themselves\r\nfrom the responsibilities of ownership. Further, it was felt by the\r\nframers of the Bill that a moral obligation rested on the Imperial\r\nGovernment to remove, if possible, \"the fearful exasperations attending\r\nthe agrarian relations in Ireland,\" rather than leave a question so\r\nfraught with danger, and so involved in difficulty, to be determined by\r\nthe Irish Government on its first entry on official existence. Such were\r\nthe governing motives for bringing in the Land Bill.\r\n\r\nTo understand an Irish Land Bill it is necessary to dismiss at once all\r\nideas of the ordinary relations between landlord and tenant in England,\r\nand to grasp a true conception of the condition of an Irish tenanted\r\nestate. In England the relation between the landlord and tenant of a\r\nfarm resembles, with a difference in the subject-matter, the relation\r\nbetween the landlord and tenant of a furnished house. In the case of the\r\nhouse, the landlord keeps it in a state fit for habitation, and the\r\ntenant pays rent for the privilege of living in another man's house. In\r\nthe case of the farm, the landlord provides the farm with house,\r\nfarm-buildings, gates, and other permanent improvements required to fit\r\nit for cultivation by the tenant, and the tenant pays rent for the\r\nprivilege of cultivating the farm, receiving the proceeds of that\r\ncultivation. The characters of owner and tenant, however long the\r\nconnection between them may subsist, are quite distinct. The tenant does\r\nno acts of ownership, and never regards the land as belonging to\r\nhimself, quitting it without hesitation if he can make more money by\r\ntaking another farm. In Ireland the whole situation is different:\r\ninstead of a farm of some one hundred or two hundred acres, the tenant\r\nhas a holding varying, say, from five to fifty acres, for which he pays\r\nan annual rent-charge to the landlord. He, or his ancestors have, in the\r\nopinion of the tenant, acquired a quasi-ownership in the land by making\r\nall the improvements, and he is only removable on non-payment of the\r\nfixed rent, or non-fulfilment of certain specified conditions. In short,\r\nin Ireland the ownership is dual: the landlord is merely the lord of a\r\nquasi-copyhold manor, consisting of numerous small tenements held by\r\nquasi-copyholders who, so long as they pay what may be called the\r\nmanorial rents, and fulfil the manorial conditions, regard themselves as\r\nindependent owners of their holdings. An Irish Land Bill, then, dealing\r\nwith tenanted estates, is, in fact, merely a Bill for converting the\r\nsmall holders of tenements held at a fixed rent into fee-simple owners\r\nby redemption of the rent due to the landlord and a transfer of the land\r\nto the holders. Every scheme, therefore, for settling the Land question\r\nin Ireland resolves itself into an inquiry as to the best mode of paying\r\noff the rent-charges due to the landlord. The tenant cannot, of course,\r\nraise the capital sufficient for paying off the redemption money; some\r\nState authority must, therefore, intervene and advance the whole or the\r\ngreater part of that money, and recoup itself for the advance by the\r\ncreation in its own favour of an annual charge on the holding sufficient\r\nto repay in a certain number of years both the principal and interest\r\ndue in respect of the advance.\r\n\r\nThe first problem, then, in an Irish Land Bill, is to settle the\r\nconditions of this annuity in such a manner as to satisfy the landlord\r\nand tenant; the first, as to the price of his estate; the second, as to\r\nthe amount of the annuity to be paid by him, at the same time to provide\r\nthe State authority with adequate security for the repayment of the\r\nadvance, or, in other words, for the punctual payments of the annuity\r\nwhich is to discharge the advance. Next in importance to the financial\r\nquestion of the adjustment of the annuity comes the administrative\r\ndifficulty of investigating the title, and thus securing to the tenant\r\nthe possession of the fee simple, and to the State authority the\r\nposition of a mortgagee. Under ordinary circumstances the investigation\r\nof the title to an estate involves the examination of every document\r\nrelating thereto for a period of forty years, and the distribution of\r\nthe purchase-money amongst the head renters, mortgagees, and other\r\nencumbrancers, who, in addition to the landlord, are found to be\r\ninterested in the ownership of almost every Irish estate. Such a\r\nprocess is costly, even in the case of large estates, and involves an\r\nexpense almost, and, indeed, speaking generally, absolutely prohibitory\r\nin the case of small properties. Some mode, then, must be devised for\r\nreducing this expense within manageable limits, or any scheme for\r\ndealing with Irish land, however well devised from a financial point of\r\nview, will sink under the burden imposed by the expense attending the\r\ntransfer of the land to the new proprietors. Having thus stated the two\r\nprincipal difficulties attending the Land question in Ireland, it may be\r\nwell before entering on the details of the Sale and Purchase of Land\r\n(Ireland) Bill, to mention the efforts which have been made during the\r\nlast fifteen years to surmount those difficulties. The Acts having this\r\nobject in view are the Land Acts of 1870, 1872, and 1881, brought in by\r\nMr. Gladstone, and the Land Purchase Act of 1885, brought in by the\r\nConservative Lord Chancellor of Ireland (Lord Ashbourne). The Act of\r\n1870, as amended by the Act of 1872, provided that the State authority\r\nmight advance two-thirds of the purchase-money. An attempt was made to\r\nget over the difficulties of title by providing that the Landed Estates\r\nCourt or Board of Works shall undertake the investigation of the title\r\nand the transfer and distribution of the purchase-money at a fixed\r\nprice. The Act of 1881 increased the advance to three-quarters, leaving\r\nthe same machinery to deal with the title. Both under the Acts of 1870\r\nand 1881 the advance was secured by an annuity of 5 per cent., payable\r\nfor the period of thirty-five years, and based on the loan of the money\r\nby the English Exchequer at 3-1/2 per cent. interest. These Acts\r\nproduced very little effect. The expense of dealing with the titles in\r\nthe Landed Estates Court proved overwhelming, and neither the Board of\r\nWorks, under the Act of 1872, nor the Land Commission, under the Act of\r\n1881, found themselves equal to the task of completing inexpensively the\r\ntransfer of the land; further, the tenants had no means of providing\r\neven the quarter of the purchase-money required by the Act of 1881. In\r\n1885 Lord Ashbourne determined to remove all obstacles at the expense of\r\nthe English Exchequer. By the Land Act of that year he authorized the\r\nwhole of the purchase-money to be advanced by the State, with a\r\nguarantee by the landlord, to be carried into effect by his allowing\r\none-fifth of the purchase-money to remain in the hands of the agents of\r\nthe State Authority until one-fifth of the purchase-money had been\r\nrepaid by the annual payments of the tenants. The principal was to be\r\nrecouped by an annuity of 4 per cent., extending over a period of\r\nforty-nine years, instead of an annuity of 5 per cent. extending over a\r\nperiod of thirty-five years. The English Exchequer was to advance the\r\nmoney on the basis of interest at 3-1/8 per cent., instead of at 3-1/2\r\nper cent. Though sufficient time has not yet elapsed to show whether the\r\ngreat bribe offered by the Act of 1885, at the expense of the British\r\ntaxpayer, will succeed in overcoming the apathy of the tenants, it\r\ncannot escape notice that if the Act of 1885 succeeds better than the\r\nprevious Acts, it will owe that success solely to the greater amount of\r\nrisk which it imposes on the English Exchequer, and not to any\r\nimprovement in the scheme in respect of securing greater certainty of\r\nsale to the Irish landlord, or of diminishing the danger of loss to the\r\nEnglish taxpayer.\r\n\r\nSuch being the state of legislation, and such the circumstances of the\r\nland question in Ireland in the year 1886, the Irish Government Bill\r\nafforded Mr. Gladstone the means and the opportunity of bringing in a\r\nLand Bill which would secure to the Irish landlord the certainty of\r\nselling his land at a fair price, without imposing any practical\r\nliability on the English Exchequer, and would, at the same time,\r\ndiminish the annual sums payable by the tenant; while it also conferred\r\na benefit on the Irish Exchequer. These advantages were, as will be\r\nseen, gained, firstly, by the pledge of English credit on good security,\r\ninstead of advancing money on a mere mortgage on Irish holdings, made\r\ndirectly to the English Government; and, secondly, by the interposition\r\nof the Irish Government, as the immediate creditor of the Irish tenant.\r\nThe scheme of the Land Purchase Bill is as follows:--The landlord of an\r\nagricultural estate occupied by tenants may apply to a department of the\r\nnew Irish Government to purchase his estate. The tenants need not be\r\nconsulted, as the purchase, if completed, will necessarily better their\r\ncondition, and thus at the very outset the difficulty of procuring the\r\nassent of the tenants, which has hitherto proved so formidable an\r\nobstacle to all Irish land schemes, disappears. The landlord may require\r\nthe department to which he applies (called in the Bill the State\r\nAuthority) to pay him the statutory price of his estate, not in cash,\r\nbut in consols valued at par. This price, except in certain unusual\r\ncases of great goodness or of great badness of the land, is twenty\r\nyears' purchase of the _net_ rental. The _net_ rental is the _gross_\r\nrental after deducting from that rent tithe rent-charge, the average\r\npercentage for expenses in respect of bad debts, any rates paid by the\r\nlandlord, and any like outgoings. The _gross_ rental of an estate is the\r\ngross rent of all the holdings on the estate, payable in the year ending\r\nin November, 1885. Where a judicial rent has been fixed, it is the\r\njudicial rent; where no judicial rent has been fixed, it is the rent to\r\nbe determined in the manner provided by the Bill.\r\n\r\nTo state this shortly, the Bill provides that an Irish landlord may\r\nrequire the State Authority to pay him for his estate, in consols valued\r\nat par, a capital sum equal to twenty times the amount of the annual sum\r\nwhich he has actually put into his pocket out of the proceeds of the\r\nestate. The determination of the statutory price is, so far as the\r\nlandlord is concerned, the cardinal point of the Bill, and in order\r\nthat no injustice may be done the landlord, an Imperial\r\nCommission--called the Land Commission--is appointed by the Bill, whose\r\nduty it is to fix the statutory price, and, where there is no judicial\r\nrent, to determine the amount of rent which, in the character of gross\r\nrental, is to form the basis of the statutory price. The Commission also\r\npay the purchase-money to the landlord, or distribute it amongst the\r\nparties entitled, and generally the Commission act as intermediaries\r\nbetween the landlord and the Irish State Authority, which has no power\r\nof varying the terms to which the landlord is entitled under the Bill,\r\nor of judging of the conditions which affect the statutory price. If the\r\nlandlord thinks the price fixed by the Land Commission, as the statutory\r\nprice inequitable, he may reject their offer and keep his estate.\r\n\r\nSupposing, however, the landlord to be satisfied with the statutory\r\nprice offered by the Land Commission, the sale is concluded, and the\r\nLand Commission make an order carrying the required sum of consols\r\n(which is for convenience hereinafter called the purchase-money,\r\nalthough it consists of stock and not of cash) to the account of the\r\nestate in their books after deducting 1 per cent. for the cost of\r\ninvestigation of title and distribution of the purchase-money, and upon\r\nthe purchase-money being thus credited to the estate, the landlord\r\nceases to have any interest in the estate, and the tenants, by virtue of\r\nthe order of the Land Commission, become owners in fee simple of their\r\nholdings, subject to the payment to the Irish State Authority of an\r\nannuity. The amount of the annuity is stated in the Bill. It is a sum\r\nequal to £4 per cent. on a capital sum equal to twenty times the amount\r\nof the gross rental of the holding. The illustration given by Mr.\r\nGladstone in his speech will at once explain these apparently intricate\r\nmatters of finance. A landlord is entitled to the Hendon estate,\r\nproducing £1200 a year gross rental; to find the net rental, the Land\r\nCommission deduct from this gross rental outgoings estimated at about 20\r\nper cent., or £240 a year. This makes the net rental £960 a year, and\r\nthe price payable to the landlord is £19,200 (twenty years' purchase of\r\n£960, or £960 multiplied by 20), which, as above stated, will be paid in\r\nconsols. The tenants will pay, as the maximum amount for their holdings,\r\n£4 per cent. for forty-nine years on the capitalized value of twenty\r\nyears' purchase of the gross rent. This will amount to £960 instead of\r\n£1,200, which they have hitherto paid; a saving of £240 a year will thus\r\nbe effected, from which, however, must be deducted the half rates to\r\nwhich they will become liable, formerly paid by the landlord. This £4\r\nper cent. charge payable by the tenants will continue for forty-nine\r\nyears, but at the end of that time each tenant will become a free owner\r\nof his estate without any annual payment. Next, as to the position of\r\nthe State Authority. The State Authority receives £960 from the tenants;\r\nit pays out of that sum £4 per cent., not upon the gross rental, but\r\nupon the net rental capitalized, that is to say, £768 to the Imperial\r\nExchequer. The State Authority, therefore, receives,£960, and assuming\r\nthat the charge of collecting the rental is 2 per cent., that is to say,\r\n£19 4_s._, the State Authority will, out of £960, have to disburse only\r\n£787 4_s._, leaving it a gainer of £172 16_s._, or nearly 18 per cent.\r\nThe result then between the several parties is, the landlord receives\r\n£19,200; the tenantry pay £240 a year less than they have hitherto paid,\r\nand at the end of forty-nine years are exempt altogether from payment;\r\nthe gain of Irish State Authority is £172 16_s._ a year. Another mode of\r\nputting the case shortly is as follows: The English Exchequer lends the\r\nmoney to the Irish State Authority at 3-1/8 per cent. and an annuity of\r\n4 per cent. paid during forty-nine years will, as has been stated above,\r\nrepay both principal and interest for every £100 lent at 3-1/8 per\r\ncent. On the sale of an estate under the Bill, the landlord receives\r\ntwenty years' purchase; the tenant pays £4 per cent. on twenty years'\r\npurchase of the gross rental; the Irish State Authority receives £4 per\r\ncent. on the gross rental; the English Exchequer receives 4 per cent. on\r\nthe net rental only. The repayment of the interest due by the Irish\r\nAuthority to the English Exchequer is in no wise dependent on the\r\npunctual payment of their annuities by the Irish tenants, nor does the\r\nEnglish Government in any way figure as the landlord or creditor of the\r\nIrish tenants. The annuities payable by the tenants are due to the Irish\r\nGovernment, and collected by them, while the interest due to the English\r\nGovernment is a charge on the whole of the Irish Government funds; and\r\nfurther, these funds themselves are paid into the hands of the Imperial\r\nofficer, whose duty it is to liquidate the debt due to his master, the\r\nImperial Exchequer, before a sixpence can be touched by the Irish\r\nGovernment. It is not, then, any exaggeration to say that the Land\r\nPurchase Bill of 1886 provides for the settlement of the Irish Land\r\nquestion without any appreciable risk to the English Exchequer, and with\r\nthe advantage of securing a fair price for the landlord, a diminution of\r\nannual payments to the tenant with the ultimate acquisition of the fee\r\nsimple, also a gain of no inconsiderable sum to the Irish Exchequer. In\r\norder to obviate the difficulties attending the investigation of title\r\nand transfer of the property, the Bill provides, as stated above, that\r\non the completion of the agreement for the sale between the landlord and\r\nthe Commission, the holding shall vest at once in the tenants: it then\r\nproceeds to declare that the claims of all persons interested in the\r\nland shall attach to the purchase-money in the same manner as though it\r\nwere land. The duty of ascertaining these claims and distributing the\r\npurchase-money is vested in the Land Commission, who undertake the task\r\nin exchange for the 1 per cent. which they have, as above stated,\r\ndeducted from the purchase-money as the cost of conducting the complete\r\ntransfer of the estate from the landlord to the tenants. The difficulty\r\nof the process of dealing with the purchase-money depends, of course, on\r\nthe intricacy of the title. If the vendor is the sole unencumbered\r\nowner, he is put in immediate possession of the stock constituting the\r\nprice of the estate. If there are encumbrances, as is usually the case,\r\nthey are paid off by the Land Commission. Capital sums are paid in full;\r\njointures and other life charges are valued according to the usual\r\ntables. Drainage and other temporary charges are estimated at their\r\npresent value, permanent rent-charges are valued by agreement, or in\r\ncase of disagreement, by the Land Commission; a certain minimum number\r\nof years' purchase being assigned by the Bill to any permanent\r\nrent-charge which amounts only to one-fifth part of the rental of the\r\nestate on which it is charged, this provision being made to prevent\r\ninjustice being done to the holders of rent-charges which are amply\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nIt remains to notice certain other points of some importance. The\r\nlandlord entitled to require the State to purchase his property is the\r\nimmediate landlord, that is to say, the person entitled to the receipt\r\nof the rent of the estate; no encumbrancer can avail himself of the\r\nprivilege, the reason being that the Bill is intended to assist solvent\r\nlandlords, and not to create a new Encumbered Estates Court. The\r\nlandlord may sell this privilege, and possibly by means of this power of\r\nsale may be able to put pressure on his encumbrancers to reduce their\r\nclaims in order to obtain immediate payment. The Land Commission, in\r\ntheir character of quasi-arbitrators between the landlord and the Irish\r\nState Authority, have ample powers given to enable them to do justice.\r\nIf the statutory price, as settled according to the Act, is too low,\r\nthey may raise it to twenty-two years' purchase instead of twenty years'\r\npurchase. If it is too high, they may refuse to buy unless the landlord\r\nwill reduce it to a proper price. In the congested districts scheduled\r\nin the Bill the land, on a sale, passes to the Irish State Authority, as\r\nlandlords, and not to the tenants; the reason being that it is\r\nconsidered that the tenants would be worsened, rather than bettered, by\r\nhaving their small plots vested in them in fee simple. For the same\r\ncause it is provided that in any part of Ireland tenants of holdings\r\nunder £4 a year may object to become the owners of their holdings, which\r\nwill thereupon vest, on a sale, in the Irish State Authority. Lastly,\r\nthe opportunity is taken of establishing a registry of title in respect\r\nof all property dealt with under the Bill. The result of such a registry\r\nwould be that any property entered therein would ever thereafter be\r\ncapable of being transferred with the same facility, and at as little\r\nexpense, as stock in the public funds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Any charge in excess of one million was to be borne by\r\nImperial Exchequer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"UNIONIST\" POSITION.\r\n\r\nBY CANON MACCOLL\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it not time that the opponents of Home Rule for Ireland should define\r\ntheir position? They defeated Mr. Gladstone's scheme last year in\r\nParliament and in the constituencies; and they defeated it by the\r\npromise of a counter policy which was to consist, in brief, of placing\r\nIreland on the same footing as Great Britain in respect to Local\r\nGovernment; or, if there was to be any difference, it was to be in the\r\ndirection of a larger and more generous measure for Ireland than for the\r\nrest of the United Kingdom. This certainly was the policy propounded by\r\nthe distinguished leader of the Liberal Unionists in his speech at\r\nBelfast, in November, 1885, and repeated in his electoral speeches last\r\nyear. In the Belfast speech Lord Hartington said: \"My opinion is that it\r\nis desirable for Irishmen that institutions of local self-government\r\nsuch as are possessed by England and Scotland, and such as we hope to\r\ngive in the next session in greater extent to England and Scotland,\r\nshould also be extended to Ireland.\" But this extension of local\r\nself-government to Ireland would require, in Lord Hartington's opinion,\r\na fundamental change in the fabric of Irish Government. \"I would not\r\nshrink,\" he says, \"from a great and bold reconstruction of the Irish\r\nGovernment,\" a reconstruction leading up gradually to some real and\r\nsubstantial form of Home Rule. His Lordship's words are: \"I submit with\r\nsome confidence to you these principles, which I have endeavoured to lay\r\ndown, and upon which, I think, the extension of Local Government in\r\nIreland must proceed. First, you must have some adequate guarantees both\r\nfor the maintenance of the essential unity of the Empire and for the\r\nprotection of the minority in Ireland. And, secondly, you must also\r\nadmit this principle: the work of complete self-government of Ireland,\r\nthe grant of full control over the management of its own affairs, is not\r\na grant that can be made by any Parliament of this country in a day. It\r\nmust be the work of continuous and careful effort.\" Elsewhere in the\r\nsame speech Lord Hartington says: \"Certainly I am of opinion that\r\nnothing can be done in the direction of giving Ireland anything like\r\ncomplete control over her own affairs either in a day, or a session, or\r\nprobably in a Parliament.\" \"Complete control over her own affairs,\" \"the\r\nwork of complete self-government of Ireland, the grant of full control\r\nover the management of its own affairs:\" this is the policy which Lord\r\nHartington proclaimed in Ulster, the promise which he, the proximate\r\nLiberal leader, held out to Ireland on the eve of the General Election\r\nof 1885. It was a policy to be begun \"in the next session,\" though not\r\nlikely to be completed \"in a day, or a session, or probably in a\r\nParliament.\"\r\n\r\nNext to Mr. Gladstone and Lord Hartington the most important member of\r\nthe Liberal party at that time was undoubtedly Mr. Chamberlain, and Mr.\r\nChamberlain's Irish policy was proclaimed in the _Radical Programme,\r\nwhich was published before the General Election as the Radical leader's\r\nmanifesto to the constituencies. This scheme, which Mr. Chamberlain had\r\nsubmitted as a responsible minister to the Cabinet of Mr. Gladstone in\r\nJune, 1885, culminated in a National Council which was to control a\r\nseries of local bodies and govern the whole of Ireland. \"His National\r\nCouncil was to consist of two orders; one-third of its members were to\r\nbe elected by the owners of property, and two-thirds by ratepayers. The\r\nNational Council also was to be a single one, and Ulster was not to have\r\na separate Council. As the Council was to be charged with the\r\nsupervision and legislation about education, which is the burning\r\nquestion between Catholics and Protestants, it is clear that Mr.\r\nChamberlain at that time contemplated no special protection for\r\nUlster.\"[15] Moreover, in a letter dated April 23rd, 1886, and published\r\nin the _Daily News_ of May 17th, 1886, Mr. Chamberlain declared that he\r\n\"had not changed his opinion in the least\" since his first public\r\ndeclaration on Irish policy in 1874. \"I then said that I was in favour\r\nof the principles of Home Rule, as defined by Mr. Butt, but that I would\r\ndo nothing which would weaken in any way Imperial unity, and that I did\r\nnot agree with all the details of his plan.... Mr. Butt's proposals were\r\nin the nature of a federal scheme, and differ entirely from Mr.\r\nGladstone's, which are on the lines of Colonial independence. Mr. Butt\r\ndid not propose to give up Irish representation at Westminster.\" It is\r\ntrue that Mr. Butt did not propose to give up Irish representation at\r\nWestminster; but it is also true that he proposed to give it up in the\r\nsense in which Mr. Chamberlain wishes to retain it. Mr. Butt's words, in\r\nthe debate to which Mr. Chamberlain refers, are, \"that the House should\r\nmeet _without Irish members_ for the discussion of English and Scotch\r\nbusiness; and when there was any question affecting the Empire at large,\r\nIrish members might be summoned to attend. He saw no difficulty in the\r\nmatter.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThere is no need to quote Mr. Gladstone's declarations on the Irish\r\nquestion at the General Election of 1885, and previously. He has been\r\naccused of springing a surprise on the country when he proposed Home\r\nRule in the beginning of 1886. That is not, at all events, the opinion\r\nof Lord Hartington. In a speech delivered at the Eighty Club in March,\r\n1886, his Lordship, with his usual manly candour, declared as follows:\r\n\"I am not going to say one word of complaint or charge against Mr.\r\nGladstone for the attitude which he has taken on this question. I think\r\nno one who has read or heard, during a long series of years, the\r\ndeclarations of Mr. Gladstone on the question of self-government for\r\nIreland, can be surprised at the tone of his present declarations....\r\nWhen I look back to those declarations that Mr. Gladstone made in\r\nParliament, which have not been unfrequent; when I look back to the\r\nincreased definiteness given to those declarations in his address to the\r\nelectors of Midlothian, and in his Midlothian speeches; I say, when I\r\nconsider all these things, I feel that I have not, and that no one has,\r\nany right to complain of the tone of the declarations which Mr.\r\nGladstone has recently made upon this subject.\"\r\n\r\nSo much as to the state of Liberal opinion on the Irish question at the\r\nGeneral Election of 1885. The leaders of all sections of the party put\r\nthe Irish question in the foreground of their programme for the session\r\nof 1886. We all remember Sir Charles Dilke's public announcement that he\r\nand Mr. Chamberlain were going to visit Ireland in the autumn of 1885,\r\nto study the Irish question on the spot, with a view to maturing a plan\r\nfor the first session of the new Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhat about the Conservative party? Lord Salisbury's Newport speech was\r\navowedly the programme of his Cabinet. It was the Conservative answer to\r\nMr. Gladstone's Midlothian manifesto. He dealt with the Irish question\r\nin guarded language; but it was language which plainly showed that he\r\nrecognized, not less clearly than the Liberal leaders, the crucial\r\nchange which the assimilation of the Irish franchise to that of Great\r\nBritain had wrought in Irish policy. His keen eye saw at once the\r\nimportant bearing which that enfranchisement had on the traditional\r\npolicy of coercion: \"You had passed an Act of Parliament, giving in\r\nunexampled abundance, and with unexampled freedom, supreme power to the\r\ngreat mass of the Irish people--supreme power as regards their own\r\nlocality.... To my mind the renewal of exceptional legislation against a\r\npopulation whom you had treated legislatively to this marked confidence\r\nwas so gross in its inconsistency that you could not possibly hope,\r\nduring the few remaining months that were at your disposal before the\r\npresent Parliament expired, to renew any legislation which expressed on\r\none side a distrust of what on the other side your former legislation\r\nhad so strongly emphasized. The only result of your doing it would have\r\nbeen, not that you would have passed the Act, but that you would have\r\npromoted by the very inconsistency of the position that you were\r\noccupying--by the untenable character of the arguments that you were\r\nadvancing--you would have produced so intense an exasperation amongst\r\nthe Irish people, that you would have caused ten times more evil, ten\r\ntimes more resistance to law than your Crimes Act, even if it had been\r\nrenewed, would possibly have been able to check.\" Lord Salisbury went on\r\nto say that \"the effect of the Crimes Act had been very much\r\nexaggerated,\" and that \"boycotting is of that character which\r\nlegislation has very great difficulty in reaching.\" \"Boycotting does not\r\noperate through outrage. Boycotting is the act of a large majority of a\r\ncommunity resolving to do a number of things which are themselves legal,\r\nand which are only illegal by the intention with which they are done.\"\r\n\r\nNext to Lord Salisbury the most prominent member of the Conservative\r\nparty at that date was Lord Randolph Churchill. On the 3rd of January,\r\n1885, when it was rumoured that Mr. Gladstone's Government, then in\r\noffice, intended to renew a few of the clauses of the Crimes Act, Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill made a speech at Bow against any such policy. The\r\nfollowing quotation will suffice as a specimen of his opinion: \"It comes\r\nto this, that the policy of the Government in Ireland is to declare on\r\nthe one hand, by the passing of the Reform Bill, that the Irish people\r\nare perfectly capable of exercising for the advantage of the Empire the\r\nhighest rights and privileges of citizenship; and by the proposal to\r\nrenew the Crimes Act they simultaneously declare, on the other hand,\r\nthat the Irish people are perfectly incapable of performing for the\r\nadvantage of society the lowest and most ordinary duties of\r\ncitizenship.... All I can say is that, if such an incoherent, such a\r\nridiculous, such a dangerously ridiculous combination of acts can be\r\ncalled a policy, then, thank God, the Conservative party have no\r\npolicy.\"\r\n\r\nWithin a few months of the delivery of that speech a Conservative\r\nGovernment was in office, with Lord Randolph Churchill as its leader in\r\nthe House of Commons; and one of the first acts of the new leader was to\r\nseparate himself ostentatiously from the Irish policy of Lord Spencer\r\nand from the policy of coercion in general. Lord Randolph Churchill, as\r\nthe organ of the Government in the House of Commons, repudiated in\r\nscornful language any atom of sympathy with the policy pursued by Lord\r\nSpencer in Ireland; and Lord Carnarvon, the new Viceroy, declared that\r\n\"the era of coercion\" was past, and that the Conservative Government\r\nintended to govern Ireland by the ordinary law. Lord Carnarvon, in\r\naddition, and very much to his credit, sought and obtained an interview\r\nwith Mr. Parnell, and discussed with him, in sympathetic language, the\r\nquestion of Home Rule. In his own explanation of this interview Lord\r\nCarnarvon admitted that he desired to see established in Ireland some\r\nform of self-government which would satisfy \"the national sentiment.\"\r\n\r\nIt is idle, therefore, to assert that the question of Home Rule for\r\nIreland, in some form or other, was sprung on the country as a surprise\r\nby Mr. Gladstone in the beginning of 1886. The question was brought\r\nprominently before the public in the General Election of 1885 as one\r\nthat must be faced in the new Parliament. All parties were committed to\r\nthat policy, and the only difference was as to the character and limits\r\nof the measure of self-government to be granted to Ireland; whether it\r\nwas to be large enough to satisfy \"the national sentiment,\" as Lord\r\nCarnarvon, Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Gladstone, and others desired; or\r\nwhether it was to consist only of a system of county boards under the\r\ncontrol of a reformed Dublin Castle. There was a general agreement that\r\nthe grant to Ireland of electoral equality with England necessitated\r\nequality of political treatment, and that, above all things, there was\r\nto be no renewal of the stale policy of Coercion until the Irish people\r\nhad got an opportunity of proving or disproving their fitness for\r\nself-government, unless, indeed, there should happen to be a\r\nrecrudescence of crime which would render exceptional legislation\r\nnecessary. The election of 1886 turned almost entirely on the question\r\nof Irish government, and it is not too much to say that Conservatives\r\nand Liberal Unionists vied with Home Rulers in repudiating a return to\r\nthe policy of coercion until the effect of some kind of self-government\r\nhad been tried. Of course, there were the usual platitudes about the\r\nnecessity of maintaining law and order; but there was a _consensus_ of\r\nprofession that coercion should not be resorted to unless there was a\r\nfresh outbreak of crime and disorder in Ireland.\r\n\r\nSuch were the professions of the opponents of Home Rule in 1885 and in\r\n1886. They have now been in office for eighteen months, and what do we\r\nbehold? They have passed a perpetual Coercion Bill for Ireland, and the\r\nquestion of any kind of self-government has been relegated to an\r\nuncertain future. In his recent speech at Birmingham (Sept. 29), Mr.\r\nChamberlain has declared that the question is not ripe for solution, and\r\nthat the question of disestablishment, in Wales, Scotland, and England\r\nsuccessively, as well as the questions of Local Option, local government\r\nfor Great Britain, and of the safety of life at sea, must take\r\nprecedence of it. That means the postponement of the reform of Irish\r\nGovernment to the Greek Kalends. What justification can be made for this\r\nchange of front? No valid justification has been offered. So far from\r\nthere having been any increase of crime in the interval, there has been\r\na very marked decrease. When the Coercion Bill received the royal assent\r\nlast August, Ireland was more free from crime than it had been for many\r\nyears past. Nothing had happened to account for the return to the policy\r\nof coercion in violation of the promise to try the experiment of\r\nconciliation. The National League was in full vigour in 1885-1886, when\r\nthe policy of coercion was abandoned; boycotting was just as prevalent,\r\nand outrages were much more numerous.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is the opponents of Home Rule, not its\r\nadvocates, who owe an explanation to the public. They defeated Mr.\r\nGladstone's Bill, but promised a Bill of their own. Where is their Bill?\r\nWe hear nothing of it. They have made a complete change of front. They\r\nnow tell us that the grievance of Ireland is entirely economic, and that\r\nthe true solution of the Irish question is the abolition of dual\r\nownership in land combined with a firm administration of the existing\r\nlaw. England and Scotland are to have a large measure of local\r\ngovernment next year; but Ireland is to wait till a more convenient\r\nseason. A more complete reversal of the policy proclaimed last summer by\r\nthe so-called Unionists cannot be imagined.\r\n\r\nStill, however, the \"Unionists\" hope to be able some day to offer some\r\nform of self-government to Ireland. For party purposes they are wise in\r\npostponing that day to the latest possible period, for its advent will\r\nprobably dissolve the union of the \"Unionists.\" Lord Salisbury, Lord\r\nHartington, Mr. Bright, and Mr. Chamberlain cannot agree upon any scheme\r\nwhich all can accept without a public recantation of previous\r\nprofessions. Mr. Bright is opposed to Home Rule \"in any shape or form.\"\r\nMr. Chamberlain, on the other hand, is in favour of a great National\r\nCouncil, on Mr. Butt's lines or on the lines of the Canadian plan;\r\neither of which would give the National Council control over education\r\nand the maintenance of law and order. Latterly, indeed, Mr. Chamberlain\r\nhas advocated a separate treatment for Ulster. But the first act of an\r\nUlster Provincial Assembly would probably be to declare the union of\r\nthat Province with the rest of Ireland. Ulster, be it remembered,\r\nreturns a majority of Nationalists to the Imperial Parliament. To\r\nexclude Ulster from any share in the settlement offered to the other\r\nthree Provinces would therefore be impracticable; and Mr. Bright has\r\nlately expressed his opinion emphatically in that sense. In any case,\r\nLord Hartington could be no party to any scheme so advanced as Mr.\r\nChamberlain's. For although he declared, in his Belfast speech, that\r\n\"complete self-government\" was the goal of his policy for Ireland, he\r\nwas careful to explain that \"the extension of Irish management over\r\nIrish affairs must be a growth from small beginnings.\" But this \"growth\r\nfrom small beginnings\" would be, in Lord Salisbury's opinion, a very\r\ndangerous and mischievous policy. The establishment of self-government\r\nin Ireland, as distinct from what is commonly known as Home Rule, he\r\npronounced in his Newport speech to be \"a very difficult question;\" and\r\nin the following passage he placed his finger upon the kernel of the\r\ndifficulty:--\"A local authority is more exposed to the temptation, and\r\nhas more of the facility for enabling a majority to be unjust to the\r\nminority, than is the case when the authority derives its sanction and\r\nextends its jurisdiction over a wide area. That is one of the weaknesses\r\nof local authorities. In a large central authority the wisdom of several\r\nparts of the country will correct the folly or the mistakes of one. In a\r\nlocal authority that correction to a much greater extent is wanting; and\r\nit would be impossible to leave that out of sight in the extension of\r\nany such local authority to Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems to me a much wiser and more statesmanlike view than a system\r\nof elective boards scattered broadcast over Ireland. A multitude of\r\nlocal boards all over Ireland, without a recognized central authority to\r\ncontrol them, would inevitably become facile instruments in the hands of\r\nthe emissaries of disorder and sedition. And, even apart from any such\r\nsinister influences, they would be almost certain to yield to the\r\ntemptation of being oppressive, extravagant, and corrupt, if there were\r\nno executive power to command their confidence and enforce obedience.\r\nWithout the previous creation of some authority of that kind it would be\r\nsheer madness to offer Ireland the fatal boon of local self-government.\r\nIt would enormously increase without conciliating the power of the\r\nNationalists, and would make the administration of Ireland by\r\nconstitutional means simply impossible. The policy of the Liberal\r\nUnionists is thus much too large or much too small. It is too small to\r\nconciliate, and therefore too large to be given with safety. All these\r\nproposed concessions are liable to one insuperable objection; they would\r\neach and all enable the Irish to extort Home Rule, but under\r\ncircumstances which would rob it of its grace and repel gratitude. Mill\r\nhas some admirable observations bearing on this subject, and I venture\r\nto quote the following passage: \"The greatest imperfection of popular\r\nlocal institutions, and the chief cause of the failure which so often\r\nattends them, is the low calibre of the men by whom they are almost\r\nalways carried on. That these should be of a very miscellaneous\r\ncharacter is, indeed, part of the usefulness of the institution; it is\r\nthat circumstance chiefly which renders it a school of political\r\ncapacity and general intelligence. But a school supposes teachers as\r\nwell as scholars; the utility of the instruction greatly depends on its\r\nbringing inferior minds into contact with superior, a contact which in\r\nthe ordinary course of life is altogether exceptional, and the want of\r\nwhich contributes more than anything else to keep the generality of\r\nmankind on one level of contented ignorance.... It is quite hopeless to\r\ninduce persons of a high class, either socially or intellectually, to\r\ntake a share of local administration in a corner by piecemeal as members\r\nof a Paving Board or a Drainage Commission.\"[17]\r\n\r\nMr. Mill goes on to argue that it is essential to the safe working of\r\nany scheme of local self-government that it should be under the control\r\nof a central authority in harmony with public opinion.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Unionists\" begin, if they ever do begin, seriously to\r\ndeliberate on the question of self-government for Ireland, they will\r\nfind that they have only two practicable alternatives--the maintenance\r\nof the present system, or some scheme of Home Rule on the lines of Mr.\r\nGladstone's much misunderstood Bill. And the ablest men among the\r\n\"Unionists\" are beginning to perceive this. The _Spectator_ has in a\r\nrecent article implored Mr. Chamberlain to desist from any further\r\nproposal in favour of self-government for Ireland, because the\r\ninevitable result would be to split up the Unionist party; and Mr.\r\nChamberlain, as we have seen, has accepted the advice. Another very able\r\nand very logical opponent of Home Rule has candidly avowed that the\r\nonly alternative to Home Rule is the perpetuation of \"things as they\r\nare.\" Ireland, he thinks, \"possesses none of the conditions necessary\r\nfor local self-government.\" His own view, therefore, is \"that in\r\nIreland, as in France, an honest, centralized administration of\r\nimpartial officials, and not local self-government, would best meet the\r\nreal wants of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"The name of 'Self-government' has a natural fascination for Englishmen;\r\nbut a policy which cannot satisfy the wishes of Home Rulers, which\r\nmay--it is likely enough--be of no benefit to the Irish people, which\r\nwill certainly weaken the Government in its contest with lawlessness and\r\noppression, is not a policy which obviously commends itself to English\r\ngood sense.\"[18]\r\n\r\nWell may this distinguished \"Supporter of things as they are\" declare:\r\n\"The maintenance of the Union [on such terms] must necessarily turn out\r\nas severe a task as ever taxed a nation's energies; for to maintain the\r\nUnion with any good effect, means that, while refusing to accede to the\r\nwishes of millions of Irishmen, we must sedulously do justice to every\r\nfair demand from Ireland; must strenuously, and without fear or favour,\r\nassert the equal rights of landlords and tenants, of Protestants and\r\nCatholics; and must, at the same time, put down every outrage and reform\r\nevery abuse.\"\r\n\r\nWhat hope is there of this? Our only guide to the probabilities of the\r\nfuture is our experience of the past And what has that been in Ireland?\r\nIn every year since the Legislative Union there have been multitudes of\r\nmen in England as upright, as enlightened, as well-intentioned towards\r\nIreland, as Professor Dicey, and with better opportunities of\r\ntranslating their thoughts into acts. Yet what has been the result? _Si\r\nmonumenlum requiris circumspice_. Behold Ireland at this moment, and\r\nexamine every year of its history since the Union. Do the annals of any\r\nconstitutional Government in the world present so portentous a monument\r\nof Parliamentary failure, so vivid an example of a moral and material\r\nruin \"paved with good intentions\"? Therein lies the pathos of it. Not\r\nfrom malice, not from cruelty, not from wanton injustice, not even from\r\ncallous indifference to suffering and wrong, does our misgovernment of\r\nIreland come. If the evil had its root in deliberate wrong-doing on the\r\npart of England it would probably have been cured long ago. But each\r\ngeneration, while freely confessing the sins of its fathers, has\r\nprotested its own innocence and boasted of its own achievements, and\r\nthen, with a pharisaic sense of rectitude, has complacently pointed to\r\nsome inscrutable flaw in the Irish character as the key to the Irish\r\nproblem. The generation which passed the Act of Union, oblivious of\r\nBritish pledges solemnly given and lightly broken, wondered what had\r\nbecome of the prosperity and contentment which the promoters of the\r\nUnion had promised to Ireland. The next generation made vicarious\r\npenance, and preferred the enactment of Catholic emancipation to the\r\nalternative of civil war; and then wondered in its turn that Ireland\r\nstill remained unpacified. Then came a terrible famine, followed by\r\nevictions on a scale so vast and cruel that the late Sir Robert Peel\r\ndeclared that no parallel could be found for such a tale of inhumanity\r\nin \"the records of any country, civilized or barbarous.\" Another\r\ngeneration, pluming itself on its enlightened views and kind intentions,\r\npassed the Encumbered Estates Act, which delivered the Irish tenants\r\nover to the tender mercies of speculators and money-lenders; and then\r\nParliament for a time closed its eyes and ears, and relied upon force\r\nalone to keep Ireland quiet. It rejected every suggestion of reform in\r\nthe Land laws; and a great Minister, himself an Irish landlord,\r\ndismissed the whole subject in the flippant epigram that \"tenant-right\r\nwas landlord-wrong.\" Since then the Irish Church has been\r\ndisestablished, and two Land Acts have been passed; yet we seem to be as\r\nfar as ever from the pacification of Ireland. Surely it is time to\r\ninquire whether the evil is not inherent in our system of governing\r\nIreland, and whether there is any other cure than that which De Beaumont\r\nsuggested, namely, the destruction of the system. It is probable that\r\nthere is not in all London a more humane or a more kind-hearted man than\r\nLord Salisbury. Yet Lord Salisbury's Government will do some harsh and\r\ninequitable things in Ireland this winter, just as Liberal Governments\r\nhave done during their term of office. The fault is not in the men, but\r\nin the system which they have to administer. I see no reason to doubt\r\nthat Sir M. Hicks-Beach did the best he could under the circumstances;\r\nbut, unfortunately, bad is the best. In a conversation which I had with\r\nDr. Döllinger while he was in full communion with his Church, I ventured\r\nto ask him whether he thought that a new Pope, of Liberal ideas, force\r\nof character, and commanding ability, would make any great difference in\r\nthe Papal system. \"No,\" he replied, \"the Curial system is the growth of\r\ncenturies, and there can be no change of any consequence while it lasts.\r\nMany a Pope has begun with brave projects of reform; but the struggle\r\nhas been brief, and the end has been invariably the same: the Pope has\r\nbeen forced to succumb. His _entourage_ has been too much for him. He\r\nhas found himself enclosed in a system which was too strong for him,\r\nwheel within wheel; and while the system lasts the most enlightened\r\nideas and the best intentions are in the long run unavailing.\" This\r\ncriticism applies, _mutatis mutandis_, to what may be called the Curial\r\nsystem of Dublin Castle. It is a species of political Ultramontanism,\r\nexercising supreme power behind the screen of an official infallibility\r\non which there is practically no check, since Parliament has never\r\nhitherto refused to grant it any power which it demanded for enforcing\r\nits decrees.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, another consideration which must convince any\r\ndispassionate mind which ponders it, that the British Parliament is\r\nincompetent to manage Irish affairs, and must become increasingly\r\nincompetent year by year. In ordinary circumstances Parliament sits\r\nabout twenty-seven weeks out of the fifty-two. Five out of the\r\ntwenty-seven may safely be subtracted for holidays, debates on the\r\nAddress, and other debates apart from ordinary business. That leaves\r\ntwenty-two weeks, and out of these two nights a week are at the disposal\r\nof the Government and three at the disposal of private members; leaving\r\nin all forty-four days for the Government and sixty-six for private\r\nmembers. Into those forty-four nights Government must compress all its\r\nyearly programme of legislation for the whole of the British Empire,\r\nfrom the settlement of some petty dispute about land in the Hebrides, to\r\nsome question of high policy in Egypt, India, or other portions of the\r\nQueen's world-wide empire; and all this amidst endless distractions,\r\nenforced attendance through dreary debates and vapid talk, and a running\r\nfire of cross-examination from any volunteer questioner out of the six\r\nhundred odd members who sit outside the Government circle. The\r\nconsequence is, that Parliament is getting less able every year to\r\novertake the mass of business which comes before it. Each year\r\ncontributes its quota of inevitable arrears to the accumulated mass of\r\nprevious Sessions, and the process will go on multiplying in increasing\r\nratio as the complex and multiform needs of modern life increase. The\r\nlarge addition recently made to the electorate of the United Kingdom is\r\nalready forcing a crop of fresh subjects on the attention of Parliament,\r\nas well as presenting old ones from new points of view. Plans of\r\ndevolution and Grand Committees will fail to cope with this evil. To\r\novercome it we need some organic change in our present Parliamentary\r\nsystem, some form of decentralization, which shall leave the Imperial\r\nParliament supreme over all subordinate bodies, yet relegate to the\r\nhistoric and geographical divisions of the United Kingdom the management\r\nseverally of their own local affairs.\r\n\r\nI should have better hope from governing Ireland (if it were possible)\r\nas we govern India, than from the present Unionist method of leaving\r\n\"things as they are.\" A Viceroy surrounded by a Council of trained\r\nofficials, and in semi-independence of Parliament, would have settled\r\nthe Irish question, land and all, long ago. But imagine India governed\r\non the model of Ireland: the Viceroy and the most important member of\r\nhis Government changing with every change of Administration at\r\nWestminster;[19] his Council and the official class in general\r\nconsisting almost exclusively of native Mussulmans, deeply prejudiced by\r\nreligious and traditional enmity against the great mass of the\r\npopulation; himself generally subordinate to his Chief Secretary, and\r\nexposed to the daily criticism of an ignorant Parliament and to the\r\ndetermined hostility of eighty-six Hindoos, holding seats in Parliament\r\nas the representatives of the vast majority of the people of India, and\r\nresenting bitterly the domination of the hereditary oppressors of their\r\nrace. How long could the Government of India be carried on under such\r\nconditions?\r\n\r\nViewing it all round, then, it must be admitted that the problem of\r\ngoverning Ireland while leaving things as they are is a sufficiently\r\nformidable one. Read the remarkable admissions which the facts have\r\nforced from intelligent opponents of Home Rule like Mr. Dicey, and add\r\nto them all the other evils which are rooted in our existing system of\r\nIrish government, and then consider what hope there is, under \"things as\r\nthey are,\" of \"sedulously doing justice to every demand from Ireland,\"\r\n\"strenuously, and without fear or favour, asserting the equal rights of\r\nlandlords and tenants, Protestants and Catholics,\" \"putting down every\r\noutrage, and reforming every abuse;\" and all the \"while refusing to\r\naccede to the wishes of millions of Irishmen\" for a fundamental change\r\nin a political arrangement that has for centuries produced all the\r\nmischief which the so-called Unionist party are forced to admit, and\r\nmuch more besides, while it has at the same time frustrated every\r\nserious endeavour to bring about the better state of things which they\r\nexpect from--what? From \"things as they are!\" As well expect grapes from\r\nthorns, or figs from thistles. While the tree remains the same, no\r\namount of weeding, or pruning, or manuring, or change of culture, will\r\nmake it bring forth different fruit. Mr. Dicey, among others, has\r\ndemolished what Lord Beaconsfield used to call the \"bit-by-bit\"\r\nreformers of Irish Government--those who would administer homoeopathic\r\ndoses of local self-government, but always under protest that the supply\r\nwas to stop short of what would satisfy the hunger of the patient. But a\r\ncontinuance of \"things as they are,\" gilded with a thin tissue of\r\nbenevolent hopes and aspirations, is scarcely a more promising remedy\r\nfor the ills of Ireland. Is it not time to try some new treatment--one\r\nwhich has been tried in similar cases, and always with success? One only\r\npolicy has never been tried in Ireland--honest Home Rule.\r\n\r\nCertainly, if Home Rule is to be refused till all the prophets of evil\r\nare refuted, Ireland must go without Home Rule for ever. \"If the sky\r\nfall, we shall catch larks.\" But he would be a foolish bird-catcher who\r\nwaited for that contingency. And not less foolish is the statesman who\r\nsits still till every conceivable objection to his policy has been\r\nmathematically refuted in advance, and every wild prediction falsified\r\nby the event; for that would ensure his never moving at all. _Sedet\r\næternumque sedebit_. A proper enough attitude, perhaps, on the part of\r\nan eristic philosopher speculating on politics in the silent shade of\r\nacademic groves, but hardly suitable for a practical politician who has\r\nto take action on one of the most burning questions of our time. Human\r\naffairs are not governed by mathematical reasoning. You cannot\r\ndemonstrate the precise results of any legislative measure beforehand as\r\nyou can demonstrate the course of a planet in the solar system.\r\n\"Probability,\" as Bishop Butler says, \"is the guide of life;\" and an\r\nolder philosopher than Butler has warned us that to demand demonstrative\r\nproof in the sphere of contingent matter is the same kind of absurdity\r\nas to demand probable reasoning in mathematics. You cannot confute a\r\nprophet before the event; you can only disbelieve him. The advocates of\r\nHome Rule believe that their policy would in general have an exactly\r\ncontrary effect to that predicted by their opponents. In truth, every\r\nact of legislation is, before experience, amenable to such destructive\r\ncriticism as these critics urge against Home Rule. I have not a doubt\r\nthat they could have made out an unanswerable \"case\" against the Great\r\nCharter at Runnymede; and they would find it easy to prove on _à priori_\r\ngrounds that the British Constitution is one of the most absurd,\r\nmischievous, and unworkable instruments that ever issued from human\r\nbrains or from the evolution of events. By their method of reasoning the\r\nGreat Charter and other fundamental portions of the Constitution ought\r\nto have brought the Government of the British Empire to a deadlock long\r\nago. Every suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, every Act of Attainder,\r\nevery statute for summary trial and conviction before justices of the\r\npeace, is a violation of the fundamental article of the Constitution,\r\nwhich requires that no man shall be imprisoned or otherwise punished\r\nexcept after lawful trial by his peers.[20] Consider also the magazines\r\nof explosive materials which lie hidden in the constitutional\r\nprerogatives of the Crown, if they could only be ignited by the match of\r\nan ingenious theorist. The Crown, as Lord Sherbrooke once somewhat\r\nirreverently expressed it, \"can turn every cobbler in the land into a\r\npeer,\" and could thus put an end, as the Duke of Wellington declared, to\r\n\"the Constitution of this country.\"[21] \"The Crown is not bound by Act\r\nof Parliament unless named therein by special and particular words.\"[22]\r\nThe Crown can make peace or war without consulting Parliament, can by\r\nsecret treaty saddle the nation with the most perilous obligations, and\r\ngive away all such portions of the empire as do not rest on Statute. The\r\nprerogative of mercy, too, would enable an eccentric Sovereign, aided by\r\nan obsequious Minister, to open the jails and let all the convicted\r\ncriminals in the land loose upon society.[22] But criticism which proves\r\ntoo much in effect proves nothing.\r\n\r\nIn short, every stage in the progress of constitutional reform has, in\r\nmatter of fact, been marked by similar predictions falsified by results,\r\nand the prophets who condemn Home Rule have no better credentials;\r\nindeed, much worse, for they proclaim the miserable failure of \"things\r\nas they are,\" whereas their predecessors were in their day satisfied\r\nwith things as they were.[23]\r\n\r\nIt is, high time, therefore, to call upon the opponents of Home Rule to\r\ntell us plainly where they stand. They claim a mandate from the country\r\nfor their policy. They neither asked nor received a mandate to support\r\nthe system of Government which prevailed in Ireland at the last\r\nelection, and still less the policy of coercion which they have\r\nsubstituted for that system. Do they mean to go back or forward? They\r\ncannot stand still. They have already discovered that one act of\r\nrepression leads to another, and they will find ere long that they have\r\nno alternative except Home Rule or the suppression of Parliamentary\r\nGovernment in Ireland. Men may talk lightly of the ease with which\r\neighty-six Irish members may be kept in order in Parliament. They forget\r\nthat the Irish people are behind the Irish members. How is Ireland to be\r\ngoverned on Parliamentary principles if the voice of her representatives\r\nis to be forcibly silenced or disregarded? Could even Yorkshire or\r\nLancashire be governed permanently in that way? Let it be observed that\r\nwe have now reached this pass, namely, that the opponents of Home Rule\r\nare opposed to the Irish members, not on any particular form of\r\nself-government for Ireland, but on any form; in other words, they\r\nresist the all but unanimous demand of Ireland for what \"Unionists\" of\r\nall parties declared a year ago to be a reasonable demand. No candidate\r\nat the last election ventured to ask the suffrages of any constituency\r\nas \"a supporter of things as they are.\" Yet that is practically the\r\nattitude now assumed by the Ministerial party, both Conservatives and\r\nLiberal Unionists. It is an attitude of which the country is getting\r\nweary, as the bye-elections have shown. But the \"Unionists,\" it must be\r\nadmitted, are in a sore dilemma. Their strength, such as it is, lies in\r\ndoing nothing for the reform of Irish Government. Their bond of union\r\nconsists of nothing else but opposition to Mr. Gladstone's policy. They\r\ndare not attempt to formulate any policy of their own, knowing well that\r\nthey would go to pieces in the process. Their hope and speculation is\r\nthat something may happen to remove Mr. Gladstone from the political\r\narena before the next dissolution. But, after all, Mr. Gladstone did not\r\ncreate the Irish difficulty. It preceded him and will survive him,\r\nunless it is settled to the satisfaction of the Irish people before his\r\ndeparture. And the difficulty of the final settlement will increase with\r\nevery year of delay. Nor will the difficulty be confined to Ireland. The\r\nIrish question is already reacting upon kindred, though not identical,\r\nproblems in England and Scotland, and the longer it is kept open, so\r\nmuch the worse will it be for what are generally regarded as\r\nConservative interests. It is not the Moderate Liberals or Conservatives\r\nwho are gaining ground by the prolongation of the controversy, and the\r\ndisappearance of Mr. Gladstone from the scene would have the effect of\r\nremoving from the forces of extreme Radicalism a conservative influence,\r\nwhich his political opponents will discover when it is too late to\r\nrestore it. Their regret will then be as unavailing as the lament of\r\nWilliam of Deloraine over his fallen foe--\r\n\r\n    \"I'd give the lands of Deloraine\r\n    Dark Musgrave were alive again.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irish landlords have already begun to realize the mistake they made\r\nwhen they rejected Mr. Gladstone's policy of Home Rule and Land\r\nPurchase. It is the old story of the Sibyl's books. No British\r\nGovernment will ever again offer such terms to the Irish landlords as\r\nthey refused to accept from Mr. Gladstone. On the other hand, Home Rule\r\nis inevitable. Can any reflective person really suppose that the\r\ndemocracy of Great Britain will consent to refuse to share with the\r\nIrish people the boon of self-government which will be offered to\r\nthemselves next year? Any attempt to exclude the Irish from the benefits\r\nof such a scheme, after all the promises of the last general election,\r\nwould almost certainly wreck the government; for constituencies have\r\nways and means of impressing their wills on their representatives in\r\nParliament even without a dissolution. If, on the other hand, Ireland\r\nshould be included in a general scheme of local Government, the question\r\nof who shall control the police will arise. In Great Britain the police,\r\nof course, will be under local control. To refuse this to Ireland would\r\nbe to offer a boon with a stigma attached to it. The Irish members\r\nagreed to let the control of the constabulary remain, under Mr.\r\nGladstone's scheme, for some years in the hands of the British\r\nGovernment; but they would not agree to this while Dublin Castle ruled\r\nthe country. Moreover, the formidable difficulty suggested by Lord\r\nSalisbury and Mr. John Stuart Mill (see pp. 115, 116) would appear the\r\nmoment men began seriously to consider the question of local government\r\nfor Ireland. The government of Dublin Castle would have to go, but\r\nsomething would have to be put in its place; and when that point has\r\nbeen reached it will probably be seen that nothing much better or safer\r\ncan be found than some plan on the main lines of Mr. Gladstone's Bill.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Speech at Manchester, May 7, 1886, by Mr. Shaw-Lefevre,\r\nwho was a member of the Cabinet to which Mr. Chamberlain's scheme was\r\nsubmitted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Hansard_, vol. 220, pp. 708, 715.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Considerations on Representative Government_, p. 281.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Dicey's _England's Case against Home Rule_, pp. 25-31, and\r\nLetter in _Spectator_ of September 17th, 1887.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: From the beginning of 1880 till now there have been six\r\nViceroys and ten Chief Secretaries in Dublin--namely, Duke of\r\nMarlborough, Earls Cowper and Spencer, Earls of Carnarvon and Aberdeen,\r\nand the Marquis of Londonderry; Mr. Lowther, Mr. Forster, Lord F.\r\nCavendish, Mr. Trevelyan, Mr. Campbell Bannerman, Sir W.

A few samples\r\nwill suffice. \"It was natural,\" says Mill (_Rep. Gov._, p. 311), \"to\r\nfeel strong doubts before trial had been made how such a provision [as\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States] would work; whether the tribunal\r\nwould have the courage to exercise its constitutional power; if it did,\r\nwhether it would exercise it wisely, and whether the Government would\r\nconsent peaceably to its decision. The discussions on the American\r\nConstitution, before its final adoption, give evidence that these\r\nnatural apprehensions were strongly felt; but they are now entirely\r\nquieted, since, during the two generations and more which have\r\nsubsequently elapsed, nothing has occurred to verify them, though there\r\nhave at times been disputes of considerable acrimony, and which became\r\nthe badges of parties respecting the limits of the authority of the\r\nFederal and State Governments.\" The Austrian opponents of Home Rule in\r\nHungary predicted that it would lead straight to separation. The\r\nopponents of the Canadian Constitution prophesied that Canada would in a\r\nfew years be annexed to the United States; and Home Rule in Australia\r\nwas believed by able statesmen to involve independence at an early date.\r\nMr. Dicey himself tells us \"that the wisest thinkers of the eighteenth\r\ncentury (including Burke) held that the independence of the American\r\nColonies meant the irreparable ruin of Great Britain. There were\r\napparently solid reasons for this belief: experience has proved it to be\r\nwithout foundation.\" The various changes in our own Constitution, and\r\neven in our Criminal Code, were believed by \"men of light and leading\"\r\nat the time to portend national ruin. All the judges in the land, all\r\nthe bankers, and the professions generally, petitioned against\r\nalteration in the law which sent children of ten to the gallows for the\r\ntheft of a pocket-handkerchief. The great Lord Ellenborough declared in\r\nthe House of Lords that \"the learned judges were unanimously agreed\"\r\nthat any mitigation in that law would imperil \"the public security.\" \"My\r\nLords,\" he exclaimed, \"if we suffer this Bill to pass we shall not know\r\nwhere we stand; we shall not know whether we are on our heads or on our\r\nfeet.\" Mr. Perceval, when leader of the House of Commons in 1807,\r\ndeclared that \"he could not conceive a time or change of circumstances\r\nwhich would render further concessions to the Catholics consistent with\r\nthe safety of the State.\" (_Croker Papers_, i. 12.) Croker was a very\r\nastute man; but here is his forecast of the Reform Act of 1832: \"No\r\nkings, no lords, no inequalities in the social system; all will be\r\nlevelled to the plane of the petty shopkeepers and small farmers: this,\r\nperhaps, not without bloodshed, but certainly by confiscations and\r\npersecutions.\" \"There can be no longer any doubt that the Reform Bill is\r\na stepping-stone in England to a Republic, and in Ireland to\r\nseparation.\" Croker met the Queen in 1832, considered her very\r\ngood-looking, but thought it not unlikely that \"she may live to be plain\r\nMiss Guelph.\" Even Sir Robert Peel wrote: \"If I am to be believed, I\r\nforesee revolution as the consequence of this Bill;\" and he \"felt that\r\nit had ceased to be an object of ambition to any man of equable and\r\nconsistent mind to enter into the service of the Crown.\" And as late as\r\n1839, so robust a character as Sir James Graham thought the world was\r\ncoming to an end because the young Queen gave her confidence to a Whig\r\nMinister. \"I begin to share all your apprehensions and forebodings,\" he\r\nwrites to Croker, \"with regard to the probable issue of the present\r\nstruggle. The Crown in alliance with Democracy baffles every calculation\r\non the balance of power in our mixed form of Government. Aristocracy and\r\nChurch cannot contend against Queen and people mixed; they must yield in\r\nthe first instance, when the Crown, unprotected, will meet its fate, and\r\nthe accustomed round of anarchy and despotism will run its course.\" And\r\nhe prays that he may \"lie cold before that dreadful day.\" (_Ibid._, ii.\r\n113, 140, 176, 181, 356.) Free Trade created a similar panic. \"Good\r\nGod!\" Croker exclaimed, \"what a chaos of anarchy and misery do I foresee\r\nin every direction, from so comparatively small a beginning as changing\r\nan _average_ duty of 8_s._ into a _fixed_ duty of 8_s._, the fact being\r\nthat the fixed duty means _no duty at all_; and _no duty at all_ will be\r\nthe overthrow of the existing social and political system of our\r\ncountry!\" (_Ibid._, iii. 13.) And what have become of Mr. Lowe's gloomy\r\nvaticinations as to the terrible consequences of the very moderate\r\nReform Bill of 1866, followed as it was by a much more democratic\r\nmeasure?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LAWYER'S OBJECTIONS TO HOME RULE.\r\n\r\nBY E.L. GODKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Dicey in his _Case against Home Rule_ does me the honour to refer to\r\nan article which I wrote a year ago on \"American Home Rule,\"[24]\r\nexpressing in one place \"disagreement in the general conclusion to which\r\nthe article is intended to lead,\" and in another \"inability to follow\r\nthe inference\" which he supposes me to draw \"against all attempts to\r\nenforce an unpopular law.\" Now the object of that article, I may be\r\npermitted to explain, was twofold. I desired, in the first place, to\r\ncombat the notion which, it seemed to me, if I might judge from a great\r\nmany of the speeches and articles on the Irish question, was widely\r\ndiffused even among thoughtful Englishmen that the manner in which the\r\nIrish have expressed their discontent--that is, through outrage and\r\ndisorder--was indicative of incapacity for self-government, and even\r\nimposed upon the Englishmen the duty, in the interest of morality (I\r\nthink it was the _Spectator_ who took this view), and as a disciplinary\r\nmeasure, of refusing to such a people the privilege of managing their\r\nown affairs. I tried to show by several noted examples occurring in this\r\ncountry that prolonged displays of lawlessness, and violence, and even\r\ncruelty, such as the anti-rent movement in the State of New York, the\r\nKu-Klux outrages in the South, and the persecution of Miss Prudence\r\nCrandall in Connecticut, were not inconsistent with the possession of\r\nmarked political capacity. I suggested that it was hardly adult politics\r\nto take such things into consideration in passing on the expediency of\r\nconceding local self-government to a subject community. There was to me\r\nsomething almost childish in the arguments drawn from Irish lawlessness\r\nin the discussion of Home Rule, and in the moral importance attached by\r\nsome Englishmen to the refusal to such wicked men as the Irish of the\r\nthings they most desire. It is only in kindergartens, I said, that\r\nrulers are able to do equal and exact justice, and see that the naughty\r\nare brought to grief and the good made comfortable. Statesmen occupy\r\nthemselves with the more serious business of curing discontent. They\r\nconcern themselves but little, if at all, with the question whether it\r\nmight not be manifested by less objectionable methods.\r\n\r\nThe Irish methods of manifesting it, I endeavoured to show, were not\r\nexceptional, and did not prove either inability to make laws or\r\nunwillingness to obey them. I illustrated this by examples drawn from\r\nthe United States. I might, had I had more time and space, have made\r\nthese examples still more numerous and striking. I might have given very\r\ngood reasons for believing that, were Ireland a state in the American\r\nUnion, there probably would not have been any rent paid in the island\r\nwithin the last fifty years, and that the armed resistance of the\r\ntenants would have had the open or secret sympathy of the great bulk of\r\nthe American people. In truth, the importance of Irish crime as a\r\npolitical symptom is grossly exaggerated by English writers. I venture\r\nto assert that more murders unconnected with robbery are committed in\r\nthe State of Kentucky in one year than in Ireland in ten, and the\r\ncondition of some other Southern and Western States is nearly as bad.\r\nAll good Americans lament this and are ashamed of it, but it never\r\nenters into the heads of even the most lugubrious American moralists\r\nthat Kentucky or any other State should be disfranchised and remanded to\r\nthe condition of a Territory, because the offences against the person\r\ncommitted in it are so numerous, and the punishment of them, owing to\r\npopular sympathy or apathy, so difficult.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many Englishmen who think that when they show that\r\nGrattan's Parliament was a venal and somewhat disorderly body, which\r\noccasionally indulged in mixed metaphor, they have proved the\r\nimpossibility of giving Ireland a Parliament now. But then, as they are\r\nobliged to admit, Walpole's Parliament was very corrupt, and no one\r\nwould say that for that reason it would have been wise to suspend\r\nconstitutional government in England in the eighteenth century. It is\r\nonly through the pernicious habit of thinking of Irishmen as exceptions\r\nto all political rules that Grattan's Parliament is considered likely,\r\nhad it lasted, to have come down to our time unreformed and unimproved.\r\n\r\nThose have misunderstood me who suppose that I draw from the success of\r\nthe anti-rent movement in this State between 1839 and 1846 an inference\r\nagainst \"all attempts to enforce an unpopular law.\" Such was not by any\r\nmeans my object. What I sought to show by the history of this movement\r\nwas that there was nothing peculiar or inexplicable in the hostility to\r\nrent-paying in Ireland. The rights of the New York landlords were as\r\ngood in law and morals as the rights of the Irish landlords, and their\r\nmode of asserting them far superior. Moreover, those who resisted them\r\nwere not men of a different race, religion, or nationality, and had, as\r\nMr. Dicey says, \"none of the excuses that can be urged in extenuation of\r\nhalf-starved tenants.\" Their mode of setting the law at defiance was\r\nexactly similar to that adopted by the Irish, and it was persisted in\r\nfor a period of ten years, or until they had secured a substantial\r\nvictory. The history of the anti-rent agitation in New York also\r\nillustrates strikingly, as it seems to me, the perspicacity of a remark\r\nmade, in substance, long ago by Mr. Disraeli, which, in my eyes at\r\nleast, threw a great deal of light on the Irish problem, namely, that\r\nIreland was suffering from suppressed revolution. As Mr. Dicey says,\r\n\"The crises called revolutions are the ultimate and desperate cures for\r\nthe fundamental disorganization of society. The issue of a revolutionary\r\nstruggle shows what is the true sovereign power in the revolutionized\r\nstate. So strong is the interest of mankind, at least in any European\r\ncountry, in favour of some sort of settled rule, that civil disturbance\r\nwill, if left to itself, in general end in the supremacy of some power\r\nwhich by securing the safety at last gains the attachment of the people.\r\nThe Reign of Terror begets the Empire; even wars of religion at last\r\nproduce peace, albeit peace may be nothing better than the iron\r\nuniformity of despotism. Could Ireland have been left for any lengthened\r\nperiod to herself, some form of rule adapted to the needs of the country\r\nwould in all probability have been established. Whether Protestants or\r\nCatholics would have been the predominant element in the State; whether\r\nthe landlords would have held their own, or whether the English system\r\nof tenure would long ago have made way for one more in conformity with\r\nnative traditions; whether hostile classes and races would at last have\r\nestablished some _modus vivendi_ favourable to individual freedom, or\r\nwhether despotism under some of its various forms would have been\r\nsanctioned by the acquiescence of its subjects, are matters of uncertain\r\nspeculation. A conclusion which, though speculative, is far less\r\nuncertain, is that Ireland, if left absolutely to herself, would have\r\narrived, like every other country, at some lasting settlement of her\r\ndifficulties\" (p. 87). That is to say, that in Ireland as in New York\r\nthe attempt to enforce unpopular land laws would have been abandoned,\r\nhad local self-government existed. For \"revolution\" is, after all, only\r\na fine name for the failure or refusal of the rulers of a country to\r\npersist in executing laws which the bulk of the population find\r\nobnoxious. When the popular hostility to the law is strong enough to\r\nmake its execution impossible, as it was in New York in the rent affair,\r\nit is accepted as the respectable solution of a very troublesome\r\nproblem. When, as in Ireland, it is strong enough to produce turbulence\r\nand disorder, but not strong enough to tire out and overcome the\r\nauthorities, it simply ruins the political manners of the people. If the\r\nIrish landlords had had from the beginning to face the tenants\r\nsingle-handed and either hold them down by superior physical force, or\r\ncome to terms with them as the New York landlords had to do, conditions\r\nof peace and good will would have assuredly been discovered long ago.\r\nThe land question, in other words, would have been adjusted in\r\naccordance with \"Irish ideas,\" that is, in some way satisfactory to the\r\ntenants. The very memory of the conflict would probably by this time\r\nhave died out, and the two classes would be living in harmony on the\r\ncommon soil. If in New York, on the other hand, the Van Rensselaers and\r\nLivingstons had been able to secure the aid of martial law and of the\r\nFederal troops in asserting their claims, and in preventing local\r\nopinion having any influence whatever on the settlement of the dispute,\r\nthere can be no doubt that a large portion of this State would to-day be\r\nas poor and as savage, and apparently as little fitted for the serious\r\nbusiness of government, as the greater part of Ireland is.\r\n\r\nThere is, in truth, no reason to doubt that the idea of property in\r\nland, thoroughly accepted though it be in the United States, is\r\nnevertheless held under the same limitations as in the rest of the\r\nworld. No matter what the law may say in any country, in no country is\r\nthe right of the landed proprietor in his acres as absolute as his right\r\nin his movables. A man may own as much land as he can purchase, and may\r\nassert his ownership in its most absolute form against one, two, or\r\nthree occupants, but the minute he began to assert it against a large\r\nnumber of occupants, that is, to act as if his rights were such that he\r\nhad only to buy a whole state or a whole island in order to be able to\r\nevict the entire population, he would find in America, as he finds in\r\nIreland, that he cannot have the same title to land as to personal\r\nproperty. He would, for instance, if he tried to oust the people of a\r\nwhole district or of a village from their homes on any plea of\r\npossession, or of a contract, find that he was going too far, and that\r\nno matter what the judges might say, or the sheriff might try to do for\r\nhim, his legal position was worth very little to him. Consequently a\r\nlarge landlord in America, if he were lucky enough to get tenants at\r\nall, would be very chary indeed about quarrelling with more than one of\r\nthem at a time. The tenants would no more submit to wholesale ejectment\r\nthan the farmers in Missouri would submit some years ago to a tax levy\r\non their property to pay county bonds given in aid of a railroad. The\r\ngoods of some of them were seized, but a large body of them attended the\r\nsale armed with rifles, having previously issued a notice that the place\r\nwould be very \"unhealthy\" for outside bidders.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of this condition of American opinion on the Irish question\r\nwill be plainer if I remind English readers that the Irish in the United\r\nStates numbered in 1880 nearly 2,000,000, and that the number of persons\r\nof Irish parentage is probably between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000. In short\r\nthere are, as well as one can judge, more Irish nationalists in the\r\nUnited States than in Ireland. The Irish-Americans are to-day the only\r\nlarge and prosperous Irish community in the world. The children of the\r\nIrish born in the United States or brought there in their infancy are\r\njust as Irish in their politics as those who have grown up at home.\r\nPatrick Ford, for instance, the editor of the _Irish World_, who is such\r\na shape of dread to some Englishmen, came to America in childhood, and\r\nhas no personal knowledge nor recollection of Irish wrongs. Of the part\r\nthis large Irish community plays in stimulating agitation--both agrarian\r\nand political--at home I need not speak; Englishmen are very familiar\r\nwith it, and are very indignant over it. The Irish-Americans not only\r\nsend over a great deal of American money to their friends at home, but\r\nthey send over American ideas, and foremost among them American\r\nhostility to large landowners, and American belief in Home Rule. Now, to\r\nme, one of the most curious things in the English state of mind about\r\nthe Irish problem is the apparent expectation that this Irish-American\r\ninterference is transient, and will probably soon die out. It is quite\r\ntrue, as Englishmen are constantly told, that \"the best Americans,\" that\r\nis, the literary people and the commercial magnates, whom travelling\r\nEnglishmen see on the Atlantic coast, dislike the Irish anti-English\r\nagitation. But it is also true that the disapproval of the \"best\r\nAmericans\" is not of the smallest practical consequence, particularly as\r\nit is largely due to complete indifference to, and ignorance of, the\r\nwhole subject. There are probably not a dozen of them who would venture\r\nto express their disapproval publicly. The mass of the population,\r\nparticularly in the West, sympathize, though half laughingly, with the\r\nefforts of the transplanted Irish to \"twist the British lion's tail,\"\r\nand all the politicians either sympathize with them, or pretend to do\r\nso. I am not now expressing any opinion as to whether this state of\r\nthings is good or bad. What I wish to point out is that this\r\nIrish-American influence on Irish affairs is very powerful, and may, for\r\nall practical purposes, be considered permanent, and must be taken into\r\naccount as a constant element in the Irish problem. I will indeed\r\nventure on the assertion that it is the appearance of the\r\nIrish-Americans on the scene which has given the Irish question its\r\npresent seriousness. The attempts of the Irish at physical resistance to\r\nEnglish authority have been steadily diminishing in gravity during the\r\npresent century--witness the descent from the rebellion of 1798 to Smith\r\nO'Brien's rebellion and the Fenian rising of 1867. On the other hand the\r\npower of the Irish to act as a disturbing agency in English politics has\r\ngreatly increased, and the reason is that the stream of Irish discontent\r\nis fed by thousands of rills from the United States. Every emigrant's\r\nletter, every Irish-American newspaper, every returned emigrant with\r\nmoney in his pocket and a good coat on his back, helps to swell it, and\r\nthere is not the slightest sign, that I can see, of its drying up.\r\n\r\nWhere Mr. Dicey is most formidable to the Home Rulers, as it seems to\r\nme, is in his chapter on \"Home Rule as Federalism,\" which is the form in\r\nwhich the Irish ask for it. He attacks this in two ways. One is by\r\nmaintaining that the necessary conditions for a federal union between\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland do not exist. This disposes at one blow of all\r\nthe experience derived from the working of the foreign federations, on\r\nwhich the advocates of Home Rule have relied a good deal. The other is\r\nwhat I may call predictions that the federation even if set up would not\r\nwork. Either the state of facts on which all other federations have been\r\nbuilt does not exist in Ireland, or if it now exists, will not, owing to\r\nthe peculiarities of Irish character, continue to exist. In other words,\r\nthe federation will either fail at the outset, or fail in the long run.\r\nNo one can admire more than I do the force and ingenuity and wealth of\r\nillustration with which Mr. Dicey supports this thesis. But\r\nunfortunately the arguments by which he assails Irish federalism might\r\nbe, or might have been, used against all federations whatever. They\r\nmight have been used, as I shall try to show, against the most\r\nsuccessful of them all, the Government of the United States. I was\r\nreminded, while reading Mr. Dicey's account of the impossibility of an\r\nAnglo-Irish federation, of Mr. Madison's rehearsal in the _Federalist_\r\n(No. 38) of the objections made to the Federal Constitution after the\r\nConvention had submitted it to the States. These objections covered\r\nevery feature in it but one; and that, the mode of electing the\r\nPresident, curiously enough, is the only one which can be said to have\r\nutterly failed. A more impressive example of the danger of _à priori_\r\nattacks on any political arrangement, history does not contain. Mr.\r\nMadison says: \"This one tells me that the proposed Constitution ought to\r\nbe rejected, because it is not a confederation of the states, but a\r\ngovernment over individuals. Another admits that it ought to be a\r\ngovernment over individuals to a certain extent, but by no means to the\r\nextent proposed. A third does not object to the government over\r\nindividuals, or to the extent proposed, but to the want of a bill of\r\nrights. A fourth concurs in the absolute necessity of a bill of rights,\r\nbut contends that it ought to be declaratory not of the personal rights\r\nof individuals, but of the rights reserved to the states in their\r\npolitical capacity. A fifth is of opinion that a bill of rights of any\r\nsort would be superfluous and misplaced, and that the plan would be\r\nunexceptionable but for the fatal power of regulating the times and\r\nplaces of election. An objector in a large state exclaims loudly against\r\nthe unreasonable equality of representation in the Senate. An objector\r\nin a small state is equally loud against the dangerous inequality in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. From one quarter we are alarmed with the\r\namazing expense, from the number of persons who are to administer the\r\nnew government. From another quarter, and sometimes from the same\r\nquarter, on another occasion the cry is that the Congress will be but\r\nthe shadow of a representation, and that the government would be far\r\nless objectionable if the number and the expense were doubled. A patriot\r\nin a state that does not import or export discerns insuperable\r\nobjections against the power of direct taxation. The patriotic adversary\r\nin a state of great exports and imports is not less dissatisfied that\r\nthe whole burden of taxes may be thrown on consumption. This politician\r\ndiscovers in the constitution a direct and irresistible tendency to\r\nmonarchy. That is equally sure it will end in aristocracy. Another is\r\npuzzled to say which of these shapes it will ultimately assume, but sees\r\nclearly it must be one or other of them. Whilst a fourth is not wanting,\r\nwho with no less confidence affirms that the Constitution is so far from\r\nhaving a bias towards either of these dangers, that the weight on that\r\nside will not be sufficient to keep it upright and firm against the\r\nopposite propensities. With another class of adversaries to the\r\nConstitution, the language is, that the legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary departments are intermixed in such a manner as to contradict\r\nall the ideas of regular government and all the requisite precautions in\r\nfavour of liberty. Whilst this objection circulates in vague and general\r\nexpressions, there are not a few who lend their sanction to it. Let each\r\none come forward with his particular explanation, and scarcely any two\r\nare exactly agreed on the subject. In the eyes of one the junction of\r\nthe Senate with the President in the responsible function of appointing\r\nto offices, instead of vesting this power in the executive alone, is the\r\nvicious part of the organization. To another the exclusion of the House\r\nof Representatives, whose numbers alone could be a due security against\r\ncorruption and partiality in the exercise of such a power, is equally\r\nobnoxious. With a third the admission of the President into any share of\r\na power which must ever be a dangerous engine in the hands of the\r\nexecutive magistrate is an unpardonable violation of the maxims of\r\nrepublican jealousy. No part of the arrangement, according to some, is\r\nmore inadmissible than the trial of impeachments by the Senate, which is\r\nalternately a member both of the legislative and executive departments,\r\nwhen this power so evidently belonged to the judiciary department. We\r\nconcur fully, reply others, in the objection to this part of the plan,\r\nbut we can never agree that a reference of impeachments to the judiciary\r\nauthority would be an amendment of the error; our principal dislike to\r\nthe organization arises from the extensive powers already lodged in that\r\ndepartment. Even among the zealous patrons of a council of state, the\r\nmost irreconcilable variance is discovered concerning the mode in which\r\nit ought to be constituted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Madison's challenge to the opponents of the American Constitution to\r\nagree on some plan of their own, and his humorous suggestion that if the\r\nAmerican people had to wait for some such agreement to be reached they\r\nwould go for a long time without a government, are curiously applicable\r\nto the opponents of Irish Home Rule. They are very fertile in reasons\r\nfor thinking that neither the Gladstone plan nor any other plan can\r\nsucceed, but no two of them, so far as I know, have yet hit upon any\r\nother mode of pacifying Ireland, except the use of force for a certain\r\nperiod to maintain order, and oddly enough, even when they agree on this\r\nremedy, they are apt to disagree about the length of time during which\r\nit should be tried.\r\n\r\nMr. Dicey, in conceding the success of the American Constitution, seems\r\nto me unmindful, if I may use the expression, of the judgments he would\r\nprobably have passed on it had it been submitted to him at the outset\r\nwere he in the frame of mind to which a prolonged study of the Irish\r\nproblem has now brought him. The Supreme Court, for instance, which he\r\nnow recognizes as an essential feature of the Federal Constitution, and\r\nthe absence of which in the Gladstonian arrangement he treats as a fatal\r\ndefect, would have undoubtedly appeared to him a preposterous\r\ncontrivance. It would have seemed to him impossible that a legislature\r\nlike Congress, with the traditions of parliamentary omnipotence still\r\nstrong in the minds of the members, would ever submit to have its acts\r\nnullified by a board composed of half a dozen elderly lawyers. Nor would\r\nhe have treated as any more reasonable the expectation that the State\r\ntribunals, which had existed in each colony from its foundation, and had\r\nearned the respect and confidence of the people, would quietly submit to\r\nhave their jurisdiction curtailed, their decisions overruled, causes\r\ntorn from their calendar, and prisoners taken out of their custody by\r\nnew courts of semi-foreign origin, which the State neither paid nor\r\ncontrolled. He would, too, very probably have been most incredulous\r\nabout the prospect of the growth of loyalty on the part of New-Yorkers\r\nand Massachusetts men to a new-fangled government, which was to make\r\nitself only slightly felt in their daily lives, and was to sit a\r\nfortnight away in an improvised village in the midst of a Virginian\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nHe would, too, have ridiculed the notion that State legislatures would\r\nrefrain, in obedience to the Constitution, from passing any law which\r\nlocal sentiment strongly favoured or local convenience plainly demanded,\r\nsuch as a law impairing the obligation of obnoxious contracts, or\r\nlevying duties on imports or exports. The possibility that the State\r\nmilitia could ever be got to obey federal officers, or form an efficient\r\npart of a federal army, he would have scouted. On the feebleness of the\r\nfront which federation would present to a foreign enemy he would have\r\ndwelt with emphasis, and would have pointed with confidence to the\r\nprobability that in the event of a war some of the states would make\r\nterms with him or secretly favour his designs. National allegiance and\r\nlocal allegiance would divide and perplex the feelings of loyal\r\ncitizens. Unless the national sentiment predominated--and it could not\r\npredominate without having had time to grow--the federation would go to\r\npieces at any of those crises when the interests or wishes of any of the\r\nstates conflicted with the interests or wishes of the Union. That the\r\nnational sentiment could grow at all rapidly, considering the maturity\r\nof the communities which composed the Union and the differences of\r\norigin, creed, and manners which separated them, no calm observer of\r\nhuman nature would believe for one moment.\r\n\r\nThe American Constitution is flecked throughout with those flaws which a\r\nlawyer delights to discover and point out, and which the framers of a\r\nfederal contract can only excuse by maintaining that they are\r\ninevitable. It is true that Mr. Dicey does not even now acknowledge the\r\nsuccess of the American Constitution to be complete. He points out that\r\nif the \"example either of America or of Switzerland is to teach us\r\nanything worth knowing, the history of these countries must be read as a\r\nwhole. It will then be seen that the two most successful confederacies\r\nin the world have been kept together only by the decisive triumph\r\nthrough force of arms of the central power over real or alleged State\r\nrights\" (p. 192).\r\n\r\nIt is odd that such objectors do not see that the decisive triumph of\r\nthe central power in the late civil war in America was, in reality, a\r\nstriking proof of the success of the federation. The armies which\r\nGeneral Grant commanded, and the enormous resources in money and\r\ndevotion from which he was able to draw, were the product of the Federal\r\nUnion and of nothing else. One of the greatest arguments its founders\r\nused in its favour was that if once established it would supply\r\noverwhelming force for the suppression of any attempt to break it up.\r\nThey did not aim at setting up a government which neither foreign malice\r\nnor domestic treason, would ever assail, for they knew that this was\r\nsomething beyond the reach of human endeavour. They tried to set up one\r\nwhich, if attacked either from within or from without, would make a\r\nsuccessful resistance, and we now know that they accomplished their\r\nobject. Somewhat the same answer may be made to the objection, which is\r\nsupposed to have fatal applicability to the case of Ireland, that among\r\nthe \"special faults of federalism\" is that it does not provide\r\n\"sufficient protection of the legal rights of unpopular minorities,\" and\r\nthat \"the moral of it all is that the [American] Federal Government is\r\nnot able to protect the rights of individuals against strong local\r\nsentiment\" (p. 194 of Mr. Dicey's book). He says, moreover, if I\r\nunderstand the argument rightly, that it was bound to protect free\r\nspeech in the States because \"there is not and never was a word in the\r\nArticles of the Constitution forbidding American citizens to criticize\r\nthe institutions of the State.\" It would seem from this as if Mr. Dicey\r\nwere under the impression that in America the citizen of a State has a\r\nright to do in his State whatever he is not forbidden to do by the\r\nFederal Constitution, and in doing it has a right to federal protection.\r\nBut the Federal Government can only do what the Constitution expressly\r\nauthorizes it to do, and the Constitution does not authorize it to\r\nprotect a citizen in criticizing the institutions of his own State. This\r\narrangement, too, is just as good federalism as the committal of free\r\nspeech to federal guardianship would have been. The goodness or badness\r\nof the federal system is in no way involved in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe question to what extent a minority shall rely on the federation for\r\nprotection, and to what extent on its own State, is a matter settled by\r\nthe contract which has created the federation. The settlement of this\r\nis, in fact, the great object of a Constitution. Until it is settled\r\nsomehow, either by writing or by understanding, there is, and can be, no\r\nfederation. If I, as a citizen of the State of New York, could call on\r\nthe United States Government to protect me under all circumstances and\r\nagainst all wrongs, it would show that I was not living under a\r\nfederation at all, but under a centralized republic. The reason why I\r\nhave to rely on the United States for protection against some things and\r\nnot against others is that it was so stipulated when the State of New\r\nYork entered the Union. There is nothing in the nature of the federal\r\nsystem to prevent the United States Government from protecting my\r\nfreedom of speech. Nor is there anything in the federal system which\r\nforbids its protecting me against the establishment of a State Church,\r\nwhich, as a matter of fact, it does not do. Nor is there anything in the\r\nfederal system compelling the Government to protect me against the\r\nestablishment of an order of nobility, which, as a matter of fact, it\r\ndoes do. The reason why it does not do one of these things and does the\r\nother is simply and solely that it was so stipulated, after much\r\ndiscussion, in the contract. Most thinking men are to-day of opinion\r\nthat the United States ought to have exclusive jurisdiction of marriage,\r\nso that the law of marriage might be uniform in all parts of the Union.\r\nThe reason why they do not possess such jurisdiction is not that\r\nCongress is not fully competent to pass such a law or the federal courts\r\nto execute it, but that no such jurisdiction is conferred by the\r\nConstitution. In fact it seems to me just as reasonable to cite the ease\r\nof divorce in various States of the Union as a defect in the federal\r\nsystem, as to cite the oppression of local minorities in matters not\r\nplaced under federal authority by the organic law.\r\n\r\nIf one may judge from a great deal of writing on American matters which\r\none sees in English journals and the demands for federal interference in\r\nAmerica in State affairs which they constantly make, the greatest\r\ndifficulty Irish Home Rule has to contend with is the difficulty which\r\nmen bred in a united monarchy and under an omnipotent Parliament\r\nexperience in grasping what I may call the federal idea. The influence\r\nof association on their minds is so strong that they can hardly conceive\r\nof a central power, worthy of the name of a government, standing by and\r\nwitnessing disorders or failures of justice in any place within its\r\nborders, without stepping in to set matters right, no matter what the\r\nConstitution may say. They remind me often of an old verger in\r\nWestminster Abbey during the American civil war who told me that \"he\r\nalways knew a government without a head couldn't last.\" Permanence and\r\npeace were in his mind inseparably linked with kingship. That even Mr.\r\nDicey has not been able to escape this influence appears frequently in\r\nhis discussions of federalism. He, of course, thoroughly understands the\r\nfederal system as a jurist, but when he comes to discuss it as a\r\npolitician he has evidently some difficulty in seeing how a government\r\nwith a power to enforce _any_ commands can be restrained by contract\r\nfrom enforcing _all_ commands which may seem to be expedient or\r\nsalutary. Consequently the cool way in which the Federal Government here\r\nlooks on at local disorders seems to him a sign, not of the fidelity of\r\nthe President and Congress to the federal pact, but of some inherent\r\nweakness in the federal system.\r\n\r\nThe true way to judge the federal system, however, either in the United\r\nStates or elsewhere, is by observing the manner in which it has\r\nperformed the duties assigned to it by the Constitution. If the\r\nGovernment at Washington performs these faithfully, its failure to\r\nprevent lawlessness in New York or the oppression of minorities in\r\nConnecticut is of no more consequence than its failure to put down\r\nbrigandage in Macedonia. Possibly it would have been better to saddle it\r\nwith greater responsibility for local peace; but the fact is that the\r\nframers of the Constitution decided not to do so. They did not mean to\r\nset up a government which would see that every man living under it got\r\nhis due. They could not have got the States to accept such a\r\ngovernment. They meant to set up a government which should represent\r\nthe nation worthily in all its relations with foreigners, which should\r\ncarry on war effectively, protect life and property on the high seas,\r\nfurnish a proper currency, put down all resistance to its lawful\r\nauthority, and secure each State against domestic violence on the demand\r\nof its Legislature.\r\n\r\nThere is no common form for federal contracts, and no rules describing\r\nwhat such a contract must contain in order that the Government may be\r\nfederal and not unitarian. There is no hard and fast line which must,\r\nunder the federal system, divide the jurisdiction of the central\r\nGovernment from the jurisdiction of each State Government. The way in\r\nwhich the power is divided between the two must necessarily depend on\r\nthe traditions, manners, aims, and needs of the people of the various\r\nlocalities. The federal system is not a system manufactured on a\r\nregulation model, which can be sent over the world like iron huts or\r\nsteam launches, in detached pieces, to be put together when the scene of\r\noperation is reached. Therefore I am unable to see the force of the\r\nargument that, as the conditions under which all existing federations\r\nwere established differ in some respects from those under which the\r\nproposed federal union between England and Ireland would have to be\r\nestablished, therefore the success of these confederations, such as it\r\nis, gives them no value as precedents. A system which might have worked\r\nvery well for the New England States would not have worked well for a\r\ncombination which included also the middle and southern States. And the\r\nframers of the American Constitution were not so simple-minded as to\r\ninquire, either before beginning their labours or before ending them--as\r\nMr. Dicey would apparently have the English and Irish do--whether this\r\nor that style of constitution was \"the correct thing\" in federalism.\r\nAssuming that the people desired to form a nation as regarded the world\r\noutside, they addressed themselves to the task of discovering how much\r\npower the various States were willing to surrender for this purpose.\r\nThat was ascertained, as far as it could be ascertained, by assembling\r\ntheir delegates in convention, and discussing the wishes and fears and\r\nsuggestions of the different localities in a friendly and conciliatory\r\nspirit. They had no precedents to guide them. There had not existed a\r\nfederal government, either in ancient or modern times, whose working\r\nafforded an example by which the imagination or the understanding of the\r\nAmerican people was likely to be affected in the smallest degree. They,\r\ntherefore, had to strike out an entirely new path for themselves, and\r\nthey ended by producing an absolutely new kind of federation, which was\r\nhalf Unitarian, that is, in some respects a union of states, and in\r\nothers a centralized government; and it was provided for a Territory one\r\nend of which was more than a month's distance from the other.\r\n\r\nIt is not in its details, therefore, but in the manner of its\r\nconstruction, that the American Constitution furnishes anything in the\r\nway of guidance or suggestion to those who are now engaged in trying to\r\nfind a _modus vivendi_ between England and Ireland. The same thing may\r\nbe said of the Swiss Constitution and of the Austro-Hungarian\r\nConstitution. Both of them contain many anomalies--that is, things that\r\nare not set down in the books as among the essentials of federalism. But\r\nboth are adapted to the special wants of the people who live under them,\r\nand were framed in reference to those wants.\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian Delegations are another exception to the rule.\r\nThese Delegations undoubtedly control the ministry of the Empire, or at\r\nall events do in practice displace it by their votes. It is made\r\nformally responsible to them by the Constitution. All that Mr. Dicey can\r\nsay to this is that \"the real responsibility of the Ministry to the\r\nDelegations admits of a good deal of doubt,\" and that, at all events,\r\nit is not like the responsibility of Mr. Gladstone or Lord Salisbury to\r\nthe British Parliament. This may be true, but the more mysterious or\r\npeculiar it is the better it illustrates the danger of speaking of any\r\nparticular piece of machinery or of any particular division of power as\r\nan essential feature of a federal constitution.\r\n\r\nWe are told by the critics of the Gladstonian scheme that federalism is\r\nnot \"a plan for disuniting the parts of a united state.\" But whether it\r\nis or not once more depends on circumstances. Federalism, like the\r\nBritish or French Constitution, is an arrangement intended to satisfy\r\nthe people who set it up by gratifying some desire or removing some\r\ncause of discontent. If that discontent be due to unity, federalism\r\ndisunites; if it be due to disunion, federalism unites. In the case of\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian Empire, for instance, it clearly is a \"plan for\r\ndisuniting the parts of a united state.\" Austria and Hungary were united\r\nin the sense in which the opponents of Home Rule use the word for many\r\nyears before 1867, but the union did not work, that is, did not produce\r\nmoral as well as legal unity. A constitution was therefore invented\r\nwhich disunites the two countries for the purposes of domestic\r\nlegislation, but leaves them united for the purposes of foreign\r\nrelations. This may be a queer arrangement. Although it has worked well\r\nenough thus far, it may not continue to work well, but it does work well\r\nnow. It has succeeded in converting Hungary from a discontented and\r\nrebellious province and a source of great weakness to Austria into a\r\nloyal and satisfied portion of the Empire. In other words, it has\r\naccomplished its purpose. It was not intended to furnish a symmetrical\r\npiece of federalism. It was intended to conciliate the Hungarian people.\r\nWhen therefore the professional federal architects make their tour of\r\ninspection and point out to the Home Ruler what flagrant departures from\r\nthe correct federal model the Austro-Hungarian Constitution contains,\r\nhow improbable it is that so enormous a structure can endure, and how,\r\nafter all, the Hungarians have not got rid of the Emperor, who commands\r\nthe army and represents the brute force of the old _régime_, I do not\r\nthink he need feel greatly concerned. This may be all true, and yet the\r\nAustro-Hungarian federalism is a valuable thing. It has proved that the\r\nfederal remedy is good for more than one disease, that it can cure both\r\ntoo much unity and too little. The truth is that there are only two\r\nessentials of a federal government. One is an agreement between the\r\nvarious communities who are to live under it as to the manner in which\r\nthe power is to be divided between the general and local governments;\r\nthe other is an honest desire on the part of all concerned to make it\r\nsucceed. As a general rule, whatever the parties agree on and desire to\r\nmake work is likely to work, just as a Unitarian government is sure to\r\nsucceed if the people who live under it determine that it shall succeed.\r\nIf a federal plan be settled in the only right way, by amicable and\r\nmutually respectful discussion between representative men, all the more\r\nserious obstacles are certain to be revealed and removed. Those which\r\nare not brought to light by such discussions are pretty sure to be\r\ncomparatively trifling, and to disappear before the general success of\r\narrangement. But by a \"mutually respectful discussion\" I mean discussion\r\nin which good faith and intelligence of all concerned are acknowledged\r\non both sides.\r\n\r\nIn what I have said by way of criticism of a book which may be taken as\r\na particularly full exposition of the legal criticism that may be\r\nlevelled at Mr. Gladstone's scheme, I have not touched on the arguments\r\nagainst Home Rule which Mr. Dicey draws from the amount of disturbance\r\nit would cause in English political habits and arrangements. I freely\r\nadmit the weight of these arguments. The task of any English statesman\r\nwho gives Home Rule to Ireland in the only way in which it can be\r\ngiven--with the assent of the British people--will be a very arduous\r\none. But this portion of Mr. Dicey's book, producing, as it does, the\r\ndistinctively English objections to Home rule, is to me much the most\r\ninstructive, because it shows the difficulty there would be in creating\r\nthe state of mind in England about any federal relation to Ireland which\r\nwould be necessary to make it succeed. I do not think it an exaggeration\r\nto say that two-thirds of the English objections to Home Rule as\r\nfederalism are unconscious expressions of distrust of Irish sincerity or\r\nintelligence thrown into the form of prophecy, and prophets, as we all\r\nknow, cannot be refuted. For instance, \"the changes necessitated by\r\nfederalism would all tend to weaken the power of Great Britain\" (Dicey,\r\np. 173). The question of the command of the army could not be arranged;\r\nthe Irish army could not be depended on by the Crown (p. 174); the\r\ncentral Government would be feeble against foreign aggression, and the\r\nIrish Parliament would give aid to a foreign enemy (pp. 176-7).\r\nFederalism would aggravate or increase instead of diminishing the actual\r\nIrish disloyalty to the Crown (pp. 179-80); the Irish expectations of\r\nmaterial prosperity from Home Rule are baseless or grossly exaggerated\r\n(p. 182); the probability is, it would produce increased poverty and\r\nhardship; there would be frequent quarrels between the two countries\r\nover questions of nullification, secession, and federal taxation (p.\r\n184); neither side would acquiesce in the decision either of the Privy\r\nCouncil or of any other tribunal on these questions; Home Rulers would\r\nbe the first to resist these decisions (p. 185). Irish federation \"would\r\nsoon generate a demand that the whole British Empire should be turned\r\ninto a Confederacy\" (p. 188). Finally, as \"the one prediction which may\r\nbe made with absolute confidence,\" \"federalism would not generate the\r\ngoodwill between England and Ireland which, could it be produced, would\r\nbe an adequate compensation even for the evils and inconveniences of a\r\nfederal system\" (p. 191).\r\n\r\nNow I do not myself believe these things, but what else can any advocate\r\nof Home Rule say in answer to them? They are in their very nature the\r\nutterances of a prophet--an able, acute, and fair-minded prophet, I\r\ngrant, but still a prophet--and before a prophet the wisest man has to\r\nbe silent, or content himself by answering in prophecy also. What makes\r\nthe sceptical frame of mind in which Mr. Dicey approaches the Home Rule\r\nquestion so important is not simply that it probably represents that of\r\na very large body of educated Englishmen, but that it is one in which a\r\nfederal system cannot be produced. Faith, hope, and charity are\r\npolitical as well as social virtues. The minute you leave the region of\r\npure despotism and try any form of government in which the citizen has\r\nin the smallest degree to co-operate in the execution of the laws, you\r\nhave need of these virtues at every step. As soon as you give up the\r\nattempt to rule men by drumhead justice, you have to begin to trust in\r\nsome degree to their intelligence, to their love of order, to their\r\nself-respect, and to their desire for material prosperity, and the\r\nnearer you get to what is called free government the larger this trust\r\nhas to be. It has to be very large indeed in order to carry on such a\r\ngovernment as that of Great Britain or of the United States; it has to\r\nbe larger still in order to set up and administer a federal government.\r\nIn such a government the worst that can happen is very patent. The\r\nopportunities which the best-drawn federal constitution offers for\r\noutbreaks of what Americans call \"pure cussedness\"--that is, for the\r\nindulgence of anarchical tendencies and impulses--is greater than in any\r\nother. Therefore, to set it up, or even to discuss it with any profit,\r\nyour faith in the particular variety of human nature, which is to live\r\nunder it, has to be great. No communities can live under it together\r\nand make it work which do not respect each other. I say respect, I do\r\nnot say love, each other. The machine can be made to go a good while\r\nwithout love, and if it goes well it will bring love before long; but\r\nmutual respect is necessary from the first day. This is why Mr. Dicey's\r\nbook is discouraging. The arguments which he addressed to Englishmen\r\nwould not, I think, be formidable but for the mood in which he finds\r\nEnglishmen, and that this mood makes against Home Rule there can be\r\nlittle doubt.\r\n\r\nI am often asked by Americans why the English do not call an Anglo-Irish\r\nconvention in the American fashion, and discuss the Irish question with\r\nthe Irish, find out exactly what they will take to be quiet, and settle\r\nwith them in a rational way. I generally answer that, in the first\r\nplace, a convention is a constitution-making agency with which the\r\nEnglish public is totally unfamiliar, and that, in the second place,\r\nEnglishmen's temper is too imperial, or rather imperious, to make the\r\nidea of discussion on equal terms with the Irish at all acceptable. They\r\nare, in fact, so far from any such arrangement that--preposterous and\r\neven funny as it seems to the American mind--to say that an English\r\nstatesman is carrying on any sort of communication with the\r\nrepresentatives of the Irish people is to bring against him, in English\r\neyes, a very damaging accusation. When a man like Mr. Matthew Arnold\r\nwrites to the _Times_ to contend that Englishmen should find out what\r\nthe Irish want solely for the purpose of not letting them have it, and a\r\njournal like the _Spectator_ maintains that the sole excuse for\r\nextending the suffrage in Ireland, as it has lately been extended in\r\nEngland, was that the Irish as a minority would not be able to make any\r\neffective use of it; and when another political philosopher writes a\r\nlong and very solemn letter in which, while conceding that in governing\r\nIreland a sympathetic regard for Irish feelings and interests should be\r\ndisplayed, he mentions, as one of the leading facts of the situation,\r\nthat in \"the Irish character there is a grievous lack of independence,\r\nof self-respect, of courage, and above all of truthfulness\"--when men of\r\nthis kind talk in this way, it is easy to see that the mental and moral\r\nconditions necessary to the successful formation of a federal union are\r\nstill far off. No federal government, and no government requiring\r\nloyalty and fidelity for its successful working, was ever set up by, or\r\neven discussed between, two parties, one of which thought the other so\r\nunreasonable that it should be carefully denied everything it asked for\r\nand as unfit for any sort of political co-operation as mendacity,\r\ncowardice, and slavishness could make it.\r\n\r\nFinally let me say that there is nothing in Mr. Dicey's book which has\r\nsurprised me more, considering with what singular intellectual integrity\r\nhe attacks every point, than his failure to make any mention or to take\r\nany account of the large part which time and experience must necessarily\r\nplay in bringing to perfection any political arrangement which is made\r\nto order, if I may use the expression, no matter how carefully it may be\r\ndrafted. Hume says on this point with great wisdom, \"To balance the\r\nlarge state or society, whether monarchical or republican, on general\r\nlaws, is a work of so great difficulty, that no human genius, however\r\ncomprehensive, is able by the mere dint of reason or reflection to\r\neffect it. The judgments of many must unite in the work, experience must\r\nguide their labour, time must bring it to perfection, and the feeling of\r\ninconveniences must correct the mistakes which they inevitably fall into\r\nin their first trial and experiments.\"[25]\r\n\r\nThis has proved true of the American and Swiss federations; it will\r\nprobably prove true of the Austro-Hungarian federation and of any that\r\nmay be set up by Great Britian [Transcriber: sic.] and her colonies. It\r\nwill prove still more true of any attempt that may be made at\r\nfederation between Great Britain and Ireland. No corrections which could\r\nbe made in the Gladstonian or any other constitution would make it work\r\nexactly on the lines laid down by its framers. Even if it were revised\r\nin accordance with Mr. Dicey's criticism, it would probably be found, as\r\nin the case of the American Constitution, that few of the dangers which\r\nwere most feared for it had beset it, and that some of the\r\ninconveniences which were most distinctly foreseen as likely to arise\r\nfrom it were among the things which had materially contributed to its\r\nsuccess. History is full of the gentle ridicule which the course of\r\nevents throws on statesmen and philosophers.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Printed in the earlier part of this volume.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Essay on the Rise and Progress of the Arts and Sciences.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"UNIONIST\" CASE FOR HOME RULE.\r\n\r\nBY R. BARRY O'BRIEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am often asked, What are the best books to read on the Irish question?\r\nand I never fail to mention Mr. Lecky's _Leaders of Public Opinion in\r\nIreland_ and the _History of England in the Eighteenth Century_; Mr.\r\nGoldwin Smith's _Irish History and Irish Character, Three English\r\nStatesmen, The Irish Question_, and Professor Dicey's admirable work,\r\n_England's Case against Home Rule_.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the case for Home Rule, as stated in these books, is\r\nunanswerable; and it redounds to the credit of Mr. Lecky, Mr. Goldwin\r\nSmith, and Mr. Dicey that their narrative of facts should in no wise be\r\nprejudiced by their political opinions.\r\n\r\nThat their facts are upon one side and their opinions on the other is a\r\nminor matter. Their facts, I venture to assert, have made more Home\r\nRulers than their opinions can unmake.\r\n\r\nTo put this assertion to the test I propose to quote some extracts from\r\nthe works above mentioned.

I shall call my witnesses and let them speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nI.--MR. LECKY.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to the new edition of the _Leaders of Public Opinion\r\nin Ireland_, published in 1871--seventy-one years after Mr. Pitt's\r\nUnion, which was to make England and Ireland one nation--we find the\r\nfollowing \"contrast\" between \"national life\" in the two countries:--\r\n\r\n\"There is, perhaps, no Government in the world which succeeds more\r\nadmirably in the functions of eliciting, sustaining, and directing\r\npublic opinion than that of England. It does not, it is true, escape its\r\nfull share of hostile criticism, and, indeed, rather signally\r\nillustrates the saying of Bacon, that 'the best Governments are always\r\nsubject to be like the finest crystals, in which every icicle and grain\r\nis seen which in a fouler stone is never perceived;' but whatever\r\ncharges may be brought against the balance of its powers, or against its\r\nlegislative efficiency, few men will question its eminent success as an\r\norgan of public opinion. In England an even disproportionate amount of\r\nthe national talent takes the direction of politics. The pulse of an\r\nenergetic national life is felt in every quarter of the land. The\r\ndebates of Parliament are followed with a warm, constant, and\r\nintelligent interest by all sections of the community. It draws all\r\nclasses within the circle of political interests, and is the centre of a\r\nstrong and steady patriotism, equally removed from the apathy of many\r\nContinental nations in time of calm, and from their feverish and\r\nspasmodic energy in time of excitement. Its decisions, if not instantly\r\naccepted, never fail to have a profound and calming influence on the\r\npublic mind. It is the safety-valve of the nation. The discontents, the\r\nsuspicions, the peccant humours that agitate the people, find there\r\ntheir vent, their resolution, and their end.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible, I think, not to be struck by the contrast which, in\r\nthis respect, Ireland presents to England. If the one country furnishes\r\nus with an admirable example of the action of a healthy public opinion,\r\nthe other supplies us with the most unequivocal signs of its disease.\r\nThe Imperial Parliament exercises for Ireland legislative functions, but\r\nit is almost powerless upon opinion--it allays no discontent, and\r\nattracts no affection. Political talent, which for many years was at\r\nleast as abundant among Irishmen as in any equally numerous section of\r\nthe people, has been steadily declining, and marked decadence in this\r\nrespect among the representatives of the nation reflects but too truly\r\nthe absence of public spirit in their constituents.\r\n\r\n\"The upper classes have lost their sympathy with and their moral\r\nascendency over their tenants, and are thrown for the most part into a\r\npolicy of mere obstruction. The genuine national enthusiasm never flows\r\nin the channel of imperial politics. With great multitudes sectarian\r\nconsiderations have entirely superseded national ones, and their\r\nrepresentatives are accustomed systematically to subordinate all party\r\nand all political questions to ecclesiastical interests; and while\r\ncalling themselves Liberals, they make it the main object of their home\r\npolitics to separate the different classes of their fellow-countrymen\r\nduring the period of their education, and the main object of their\r\nforeign policy to support the temporal power of the Pope. With another\r\nand a still larger class the prevailing feeling seems to be an\r\nindifference to all Parliamentary proceedings; an utter scepticism about\r\nconstitutional means of realizing their ends; a blind, persistent hatred\r\nof England. Every cause is taken up with an enthusiasm exactly\r\nproportioned to the degree in which it is supposed to be injurious to\r\nEnglish interests. An amount of energy and enthusiasm which if rightly\r\ndirected would suffice for the political regeneration of Ireland is\r\nwasted in the most insane projects of disloyalty; while the diversion of\r\nso much public feeling from Parliamentary politics leaves the\r\nParliamentary arena more and more open to corruption, to place-hunting,\r\nand to imposture.\r\n\r\n\"This picture is in itself a very melancholy one, but there are other\r\ncircumstances which greatly heighten the effect. In a very ignorant or a\r\nvery wretched population it is natural that there should be much vague,\r\nunreasoning discontent; but the Irish people are at present neither\r\nwretched nor ignorant. Their economical condition before the famine was,\r\nindeed, such that it might well have made reasonable men despair. With\r\nthe land divided into almost microscopic farms, with a population\r\nmultiplying rapidly to the extreme limits of subsistence, accustomed to\r\nthe very lowest standard of comfort, and marrying earlier than in any\r\nother northern country in Europe, it was idle to look for habits of\r\nindependence or self-reliance, or for the culture which follows in the\r\ntrain of leisure and comfort. But all this has been changed. A fearful\r\nfamine and the long-continued strain of emigration have reduced the\r\nnation from eight millions to less than five, and have effected, at the\r\nprice of almost intolerable suffering, a complete economical revolution.\r\nThe population is now in no degree in excess of the means of\r\nsubsistence. The rise of wages and prices has diffused comfort through\r\nall classes. ... Probably no country in Europe has advanced so rapidly\r\nas Ireland within the last ten years, and the tone of cheerfulness, the\r\nimprovement of the houses, the dress, and the general condition of the\r\npeople must have struck every observer.[26] ... If industrial\r\nimprovement, if the rapid increase of material comforts among the poor,\r\ncould allay political discontent, Ireland should never have been so\r\nloyal as at present.\r\n\r\n\"Nor can it be said that ignorance is at the root of the discontent. The\r\nIrish people have always, even in the darkest period of the penal laws,\r\nbeen greedy for knowledge, and few races show more quickness in\r\nacquiring it. The admirable system of national education established in\r\nthe present century is beginning to bear abundant fruit, and, among the\r\nyounger generation at least, the level of knowledge is quite as high as\r\nin England. Indeed, one of the most alarming features of Irish\r\ndisloyalty is its close and evident connection with education. It is\r\nsustained by a cheap literature, written often with no mean literary\r\nskill, which penetrates into every village, gives the people their first\r\npolitical impressions, forms and directs their enthusiasm, and seems\r\nlikely in the long leisure of the pastoral life to exercise an\r\nincreasing power. Close observers of the Irish character will hardly\r\nhave failed to notice the great change which since the famine has passed\r\nover the amusements of the people. The old love of boisterous\r\nout-of-door sports has almost disappeared, and those who would have once\r\nsought their pleasures in the market or the fair now gather in groups in\r\nthe public-house, where one of their number reads out a Fenian\r\nnewspaper. Whatever else this change may portend, it is certainly of no\r\ngood omen for the future loyalty of the people.\r\n\r\n\"It was long customary in England to underrate this disaffection by\r\nascribing it to very transitory causes. The quarter of a century that\r\nfollowed the Union was marked by almost perpetual disturbance; but this\r\nit was said was merely the natural ground swell of agitation which\r\nfollowed a great reform. It was then the popular theory that it was the\r\nwork of O'Connell, who was described during many years as the one\r\nobstacle to the peace of Ireland, and whose death was made the subject\r\nof no little congratulation, as though Irish discontent had perished\r\nwith its organ. It was as if, the Æolian harp being shattered, men wrote\r\nan epitaph upon the wind. Experience has abundantly proved the folly of\r\nsuch theories. Measured by mere chronology, a little more than seventy\r\nyears have passed since the Union, but famine and emigration have\r\ncompressed into these years the work of centuries. The character,\r\nfeelings, and conditions of the people have been profoundly altered. A\r\nlong course of remedial legislation has been carried, and during many\r\nyears the national party has been without a leader and without a\r\nstimulus. Yet, so far from subsiding, disloyalty in Ireland is probably\r\nas extensive, and is certainly as malignant, as at the death of\r\nO'Connell, only in many respects the public opinion of the country has\r\npalpably deteriorated. O'Connell taught an attachment to the connection,\r\na loyalty to the crown, a respect for the rights of property, a\r\nconsistency of Liberalism, which we look for in vain among his\r\nsuccessors; and that faith in moral force and constitutional agitation\r\nwhich he made it one of his greatest objects to instil into the people\r\nhas almost vanished with the failure of his agitation.\"[27]\r\n\r\nFew Irish Nationalists have drawn a weightier indictment against the\r\nUnion than this. After a trial of seventy years, Mr. Lecky sums up the\r\ncase against the Union in these pregnant sentences:--\r\n\r\n\"The Imperial Parliament allays no discontent, and attracts no\r\naffection;\" \"The genuine national enthusiasm never flows in the channel\r\nof imperial politics;\" the people have \"an utter scepticism about\r\nconstitutional means of realizing their ends,\" and are imbued with \"a\r\nblind, persistent hatred of England.\" Worse still, neither the material\r\nprogress of the country, nor the education of the people, has\r\nreconciled them to the Imperial Parliament. Indeed, their disloyalty has\r\nincreased with their prosperity and enlightenment. This is the story\r\nwhich Mr. Lecky has to tell. But why are the Irish disloyal? Mr. Lecky\r\nshall answer the question.\r\n\r\n\"The causes of this deep-seated disaffection I have endeavoured in some\r\ndegree to investigate in the following essays. To the merely dramatic\r\nhistorian the history of Ireland will probably appear less attractive\r\nthan that of most other countries, for it is somewhat deficient in great\r\ncharacters and in splendid episodes; but to a philosophic student of\r\nhistory it presents an interest of the very highest order. In no other\r\nhistory can we trace more clearly the chain of causes and effects, the\r\ninfluence of past legislation, not only upon the material condition, but\r\nalso upon the character of a nation. In no other history especially can\r\nwe investigate more fully the evil consequences which must ensue from\r\ndisregarding that sentiment of nationality which, whether it be wise or\r\nfoolish, whether it be desirable or the reverse, is at least one of the\r\nstrongest and most enduring of human passions. This, as I conceive, lies\r\nat the root of Irish discontent. It is a question of nationality as\r\ntruly as in Hungary or in Poland. Special grievances or anomalies may\r\naggravate, but do not cause it, and they become formidable only in as\r\nfar as they are connected with it. What discontent was felt against the\r\nProtestant Established Church was felt chiefly because it was regarded\r\nas an English garrison sustaining an anti-national system; and the\r\nagrarian difficulty never assumed its full intensity till by the repeal\r\nagitation the landlords had been politically alienated from the\r\npeople.\"[28]\r\n\r\nLet those who imagine that the Irish question can be completely settled\r\nby the redress of material grievances take those words to heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, it is said, Scotch national sentiment is as strong as Irish, why\r\nshould not a legislative union be as acceptable to Ireland as to\r\nScotland? Mr. Lecky shall answer this question too.\r\n\r\n\"It is hardly possible to advert to the Scotch Union, without pausing\r\nfor a moment to examine why its influence on the loyalty of the people\r\nshould have ultimately been so much happier than that of the legislative\r\nunion which, nearly a century later, was enacted between England and\r\nIreland. A very slight attention to the circumstances of the case will\r\nexplain the mystery, and will at the same time show the extreme\r\nshallowness of those theorists who can only account for it by reference\r\nto original peculiarities of national character. The sacrifice of a\r\nnationality is a measure which naturally produces such intense and such\r\nenduring discontent that it never should be exacted unless it can be\r\naccompanied by some political or material advantages to the lesser\r\ncountry that are so great and at the same time so evident as to prove a\r\ncorrective. Such a corrective in the case of Scotland, was furnished by\r\nthe commercial clauses. The Scotch Parliament was very arbitrary and\r\ncorrupt, and by no means a faithful representation of the people. The\r\nmajority of the nation were certainly opposed to the Union, and,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, it is probable that much corruption was employed\r\nto effect it; but still the fact remains that by it one of the most\r\nardent wishes of all Scottish patriots was attained, that there had been\r\nfor many years a powerful and intelligent minority who were prepared to\r\npurchase commercial freedom even at the expense of the fusion of\r\nlegislatures, and that in consequence of the establishment of free trade\r\nthe next generation of Scotchmen witnessed an increase of material\r\nwell-being that was utterly unprecedented in the history of their\r\ncountry. Nothing equivalent took place in Ireland. The gradual abolition\r\nof duties between England and Ireland was, no doubt, an advantage to the\r\nlesser country, but the whole trade to America and the other English\r\ncolonies had been thrown open to Irishmen between 1775 and 1779. Irish\r\ncommerce had taken this direction; the years between 1779 and the\r\nrebellion of 1798 were probably the most prosperous in Irish history,\r\nand the generation that followed the Union was one of the most\r\nmiserable. The sacrifice of nationality was extorted by the most\r\nenormous corruption in the history of representative institutions. It\r\nwas demanded by no considerable section of the Irish people. It was\r\naccompanied by no signal political or material benefit that could\r\nmitigate or counteract its unpopularity, and it was effected without a\r\ndissolution, in opposition to the votes of the immense majority of the\r\nrepresentatives of the counties and considerable towns, and to\r\ninnumerable addresses from every part of the country. Can any impartial\r\nman be surprised that such a measure, carried in such a manner, should\r\nhave proved unsuccessful?\"[29]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland_ Mr. Lecky traces the\r\ncurrent of events which have led to the present situation. He shows how\r\nthe Treaty of Limerick was shamelessly violated, and how the native\r\npopulation was oppressed and degraded.\r\n\r\n\"The position of Ireland was at this time [1727] one of the most\r\ndeplorable that can be conceived.... The Roman Catholics had been\r\ncompletely prostrated by the battle of the Boyne and by the surrender of\r\nLimerick. They had stipulated indeed for religious liberty, but the\r\nTreaty of Limerick was soon shamelessly violated, and it found no\r\navengers. Sarsfield and his brave companions had abandoned a country\r\nwhere defeat left no opening for their talents, and had joined the Irish\r\nBrigade which had been formed in the service of France.... But while the\r\nIrish Roman Catholics abroad found free scope for their ambition in the\r\nservice of France, those who remained at home had sunk into a condition\r\nof utter degradation. All Catholic energy and talent had emigrated to\r\nforeign lands, and penal laws of atrocious severity crushed the\r\nCatholics who remained.\"[30]\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky's account of these \"penal laws\" is upon the whole, I think,\r\nthe best that has been written.\r\n\r\n\"The last great Protestant ruler of England was William III., who is\r\nidentified in Ireland with the humiliation of the Boyne, with the\r\ndestruction of Irish trade, and with the broken Treaty of Limerick. The\r\nceaseless exertions of the extreme Protestant party have made him more\r\nodious in the eyes of the people than he deserves to be; for he was\r\npersonally far more tolerant than the great majority of his\r\ncontemporaries, and the penal code was chiefly enacted under his\r\nsuccessors. It required, indeed, four or five reigns to elaborate a\r\nsystem so ingeniously contrived to demoralize, to degrade, and to\r\nimpoverish the people of Ireland. By this code the Roman Catholics were\r\nabsolutely excluded from the Parliament, from the magistracy, from the\r\ncorporations, from the bench, and from the bar. They could not vote at\r\nParliamentary elections or at vestries; they could not act as\r\nconstables, or sheriffs, or jurymen, or serve in the army or navy, or\r\nbecome solicitors, or even hold the positions of gamekeeper or watchman.\r\nSchools were established to bring up their children as Protestants; and\r\nif they refused to avail themselves of these, they were deliberately\r\nassigned to hopeless ignorance, being excluded from the university, and\r\ndebarred, under crushing penalties, from acting as schoolmasters, as\r\nushers, or as private tutors, or from sending their children abroad to\r\nobtain the instruction they were refused at home. They could not marry\r\nProtestants, and if such a marriage were celebrated it was annulled by\r\nlaw, and the priest who officiated might be hung. They could not buy\r\nland, or inherit or receive it as a gift from Protestants, or hold\r\nlife-annuities, or leases for more than thirty-one years, or any lease\r\non such terms that the profits of the land exceeded one-third of the\r\nrent. If any Catholic leaseholder by his industry so increased his\r\nprofits that they exceeded this proportion, and did not immediately make\r\na corresponding increase in his payments, any Protestant who gave the\r\ninformation could enter into possession of his farm. If any Catholic had\r\nsecretly purchased either his old forfeited estate, or any other land,\r\nany Protestant who informed against him might become the proprietor. The\r\nfew Catholic landowners who remained were deprived of the right which\r\nall other classes possessed of bequeathing their lands as they pleased.\r\nIf their sons continued Catholics, it was divided equally between them.\r\nIf, however, the eldest son consented to apostatize, the estate was\r\nsettled upon him, the father from that hour became only a life-tenant,\r\nand lost all power of selling, mortgaging, or otherwise disposing of it.\r\nIf the wife of a Catholic abandoned the religion of her husband, she was\r\nimmediately free from his control, and the Chancellor was empowered to\r\nassign to her a certain proportion of her husband's property. If any\r\nchild, however young, professed itself a Protestant, it was at once\r\ntaken from the father's care, and the Chancellor could oblige the father\r\nto declare upon oath the value of his property, both real and personal,\r\nand could assign for the present maintenance and future portion of the\r\nconverted child such proportion of that property as the court might\r\ndecree. No Catholic could be guardian either to his own children or to\r\nthose of another person; and therefore a Catholic who died while his\r\nchildren were minors had the bitterness of reflecting upon his death-bed\r\nthat they must pass into the care of Protestants. An annuity of from\r\ntwenty to forty pounds was provided as a bribe for every priest who\r\nwould become a Protestant. To convert a Protestant to Catholicism was a\r\ncapital offence. In every walk of life the Catholic was pursued by\r\npersecution or restriction. Except in the linen trade, he could not have\r\nmore than two apprentices. He could not possess a horse of the value of\r\nmore than five pounds, and any Protestant, on giving him five pounds,\r\ncould take his horse. He was compelled to pay double to the militia. He\r\nwas forbidden, except under particular conditions, to live in Galway or\r\nLimerick. In case of war with a Catholic power, the Catholics were\r\nobliged to reimburse the damage done by the enemy's privateers. The\r\nLegislature, it is true, did not venture absolutely to suppress their\r\nworship, but it existed only by a doubtful connivance--stigmatized as if\r\nit were a species of licensed prostitution, and subject to conditions\r\nwhich, if they had been enforced, would have rendered its continuance\r\nimpossible. An old law which prohibited it, and another which enjoined\r\nattendance at the Anglican worship, remained unrepealed, and might at\r\nany time be revived; and the former was, in fact, enforced during the\r\nScotch rebellion of 1715. The parish priests, who alone were allowed to\r\nofficiate, were compelled to be registered, and were forbidden to keep\r\ncurates or to officiate anywhere except in their own parishes. The\r\nchapels might not have bells or steeples. No crosses might be publicly\r\nerected. Pilgrimages to the holy wells were forbidden. Not only all\r\nmonks and friars, but also all Catholic archbishops, bishops, deacons,\r\nand other dignitaries, were ordered by a certain day to leave the\r\ncountry; and if after that date they were found in Ireland they were\r\nliable to be first imprisoned and then banished; and if after that\r\nbanishment they returned to discharge their duty in their dioceses, they\r\nwere liable to the punishment of death. To facilitate the discovery of\r\noffences against the code, two justices of the peace might at any time\r\ncompel any Catholic of eighteen years of age to declare when and where\r\nhe last heard Mass, what persons were present, and who officiated; and\r\nif he refused to give evidence they might imprison him for twelve\r\nmonths, or until he paid a fine of twenty pounds. Any one who harboured\r\necclesiastics from beyond the seas was subject to fines which for the\r\nthird offence amounted to confiscation of all his goods. A graduated\r\nscale of rewards was offered for the discovery of Catholic bishops,\r\npriests, and schoolmasters; and a resolution of the House of Commons\r\npronounced 'the prosecuting and informing against Papists' 'an\r\nhonourable service to the Government.'\r\n\r\n\"Such were the principal articles of this famous code--a code which\r\nBurke truly described as 'well digested and well disposed in all its\r\nparts; a machine of wise and elaborate contrivance, and as well fitted\r\nfor the oppression, impoverishment, and degradation of a people, and the\r\ndebasement in them of human nature itself, as ever proceeded from the\r\nperverted ingenuity of man.'\"[31]\r\n\r\nThe effects of these laws Mr. Lecky has described thus:\r\n\r\n\"The economical and moral effects of the penal laws were, however,\r\nprofoundly disastrous. The productive energies of the nation were\r\nfatally diminished. Almost all Catholics of energy and talent who\r\nrefused to abandon their faith emigrated to foreign lands. The relation\r\nof classes was permanently vitiated; for almost all the proprietary of\r\nthe country belonged to one religion, while the great majority of their\r\ntenants were of another. The Catholics, excluded from almost every\r\npossibility of eminence, deprived of their natural leaders, and\r\nconsigned by the Legislature to utter ignorance, soon sank into the\r\ncondition of broken and dispirited helots. A total absence of industrial\r\nvirtues, a cowering and abject deference to authority, a recklessness\r\nabout the future, a love of secret illegal combinations, became general\r\namong them. Above all, they learned to regard law as merely the\r\nexpression of force, and its moral weight was utterly destroyed. For the\r\ngreater part of a century, the main object of the Legislature was to\r\nextirpate a religion by the encouragement of the worst, and the\r\npunishment of some of the best qualities of our nature. Its rewards were\r\nreserved for the informer, for the hypocrite, for the undutiful son, or\r\nfor the faithless wife. Its penalties were directed against religious\r\nconstancy and the honest discharge of ecclesiastical duty.\r\n\r\n\"It would, indeed, be scarcely possible to conceive a more infamous\r\nsystem of legal tyranny than that which in the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury crushed every class and almost every interest in Ireland.\"[32]\r\n\r\nBut laws were not only passed against the native race and the national\r\nreligion. Measures were taken to destroy the industries of the country,\r\nand to involve natives and colonists, Protestants and Catholics, in\r\ncommon ruin. Mr. Lecky shall tell the story.\r\n\r\n\"The commercial and industrial condition of the country was, if\r\npossible, more deplorable than its political condition, and was the\r\nresult of a series of English measures which for deliberate and selfish\r\ntyranny could hardly be surpassed. Until the reign of Charles II. the\r\nIrish shared the commercial privileges of the English; but as the island\r\nhad not been really conquered till the reign of Elizabeth, and as its\r\npeople were till then scarcely removed from barbarism, the progress was\r\nnecessarily slow. In the early Stuart reigns, however, comparative\r\nrepose and good government were followed by a sudden rush of prosperity.\r\nThe land was chiefly pasture, for which it was admirably adapted; the\r\nexport of live cattle to England was carried on upon a large scale, and\r\nit became a chief source of Irish wealth. The English landowners,\r\nhowever, took the alarm. They complained that Irish rivalry in the\r\ncattle market was reducing English rents; and accordingly, by an Act\r\nwhich was first passed in 1663, and was made perpetual in 1666, the\r\nimportation of cattle into England was forbidden.\r\n\r\n\"The effect of a measure of this kind, levelled at the principal article\r\nof the commerce of the nation, was necessarily most disastrous. The\r\nprofound modification which it introduced into the course of Irish\r\nindustry was sufficiently shown by the estimate of Sir W. Petty, who\r\ndeclares that before the statute three-fourths of the trade of Ireland\r\nwas with England, but not one-fourth of it since that time. In the very\r\nyear when this Bill was passed another measure was taken not less fatal\r\nto the interest of the country. In the first Navigation Act, Ireland was\r\nplaced on the same terms as England; but in the Act as amended in 1663\r\nshe was omitted, and was thus deprived of the whole Colonial trade. With\r\nthe exception of a very few specified articles no European merchandise\r\ncould be imported into the British Colonies except directly from\r\nEngland, in ships built in England, and manned chiefly by English\r\nsailors. No articles, with a few exceptions, could be brought from the\r\nColonies to Europe without being first unladen in England. In 1670 this\r\nexclusion of Ireland was confirmed, and in 1696 it was rendered more\r\nstringent, for it was enacted that no goods of any sort could be\r\nimported directly from the Colonies to Ireland. It will be remembered\r\nthat at this time the chief British Colonies were those of America, and\r\nthat Ireland, by her geographical position, was naturally of all\r\ncountries most fitted for the American trade.\r\n\r\n\"As far, then, as the Colonial trade was concerned, Ireland at this time\r\ngained nothing whatever by her connection with England. To other\r\ncountries, however, her ports were still open, and in time of peace a\r\nforeign commerce was unrestricted. When forbidden to export their cattle\r\nto England, the Irish turned their land chiefly into sheep-walks, and\r\nproceeded energetically to manufacture the wool. Some faint traces of\r\nthis manufacture may be detected from an early period, and Lord\r\nStrafford, when governing Ireland, had mentioned it with a\r\ncharacteristic comment. Speaking of the Irish he says, 'There was little\r\nor no manufactures amongst them, but some small beginnings towards a\r\ncloth trade, which I had and so should still discourage all I could,\r\nunless otherwise directed by His Majesty and their Lordships. It might\r\nbe feared that they would beat us out of the trade itself by\r\nunderselling us, which they were able to do.' With the exception,\r\nhowever, of an abortive effort by this governor, the Irish wool\r\nmanufacture was in no degree impeded, and was indeed mentioned with\r\nspecial favour in many Acts of Parliament; and it was in a great degree\r\non the faith of this long-continued legislative sanction that it was so\r\ngreatly expanded. The poverty of Ireland, the low state of civilization\r\nof a large proportion of its inhabitants, the effects of the civil wars\r\nwhich had so recently convulsed it, and the exclusion of its products\r\nfrom the English Colonies, were doubtless great obstacles to\r\nmanufacturing enterprise; but, on the other hand, Irish wool was very\r\ngood, living was cheaper, taxes were lighter than in England, a spirit\r\nof real industrial energy began to pervade the country, and a\r\nconsiderable number of English manufacturers came over to colonize it.\r\nThere appeared for a time every probability that the Irish would become\r\nan industrial nation, and, had manufactures arisen, their whole social,\r\npolitical, and economical condition would have been changed. But English\r\njealousy again interposed. By an Act of crushing and unprecedented\r\nseverity, which was introduced in 1698 and carried in 1699, the export\r\nof the Irish woollen manufactures, not only to England, but also to all\r\nother countries, was absolutely forbidden.\r\n\r\n\"The effects of this measure were terrible almost beyond conception. The\r\nmain industry of the country was at a blow completely and irretrievably\r\nannihilated. A vast population was thrown into a condition of utter\r\ndestitution. Several thousands of manufacturers left the country, and\r\ncarried their skill and enterprise to Germany, France, and Spain. The\r\nwestern and southern districts of Ireland are said to have been nearly\r\ndepopulated. Emigration to America began on a large scale, and the blow\r\nwas so severe that long after, a kind of chronic famine prevailed.\"[33]\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky relates with pride how the penal code was relaxed, and the\r\ncommercial restrictions were removed, while the Irish Parliament,\r\nessentially a Protestant and landlord body, still existed, and shows how\r\nthe cause of Catholic Emancipation was retarded by the Union.\r\n\r\n\"The Relief Bill of '93 naturally suggests a consideration of the\r\nquestion so often agitated in Ireland, whether the Union was really a\r\nbenefit to the Roman Catholic cause. It has been argued that Catholic\r\nEmancipation was an impossibility as long as the Irish Parliament\r\nlasted; for in a country where the great majority were Roman Catholics,\r\nit would be folly to expect the members of the dominant creed to\r\nsurrender a monopoly on which their ascendency depended. The arguments\r\nagainst this view are, I believe, overwhelming. The injustice of the\r\ndisqualification was far more striking before the Union than after it.\r\nIn the one case, the Roman Catholics were excluded from the Parliament\r\nof a nation of which they were the great majority; in the other, they\r\nwere excluded from the Parliament of an empire in which they were a\r\nsmall minority. Grattan, Plunket, Curran, Burrowes, and Ponsonby were\r\nthe great supporters of Catholic Emancipation, and the great opponents\r\nof the Union. Clare and Duigenan were the two great opponents of\r\nemancipation, and the great supporters of the Union. At a time when\r\nscarcely any public opinion existed in Ireland, when the Roman Catholics\r\nwere nearly quiescent, and when the leaning of Government was generally\r\nliberal, the Irish Protestants admitted their fellow-subjects to the\r\nmagistracy, to the jury-box, and to the franchise. By this last measure\r\nthey gave them an amount of political power which necessarily implied\r\ncomplete emancipation. Even if no leader of genius had arisen in the\r\nRoman Catholic ranks, and if no spirit of enthusiasm had animated their\r\ncouncils, the influence possessed by a body who formed three fourths of\r\nthe population, who were rapidly rising in wealth, and who could send\r\ntheir representatives to Parliament, would have been sufficient to\r\nensure their triumph. If the Irish Legislature had continued, it would\r\nhave been found impossible to resist the demand for reform; and every\r\nreform, by diminishing the overgrown power of a few Protestant\r\nlandholders, would have increased that of the Roman Catholics. The\r\nconcession accorded in 1793 was, in fact, far greater and more important\r\nthan that accorded in 1829, and it placed the Roman Catholics, in a\r\ngreat measure, above the mercy of Protestants. But this was not all. The\r\nsympathies of the Protestants were being rapidly enlisted in their\r\nbehalf. The generation to which Charlemont and Flood belonged had passed\r\naway, and all the leading intellects of the country, almost all the\r\nOpposition, and several conspicuous members of the Government, were\r\nwarmly in favour of emancipation. The rancour which at present exists\r\nbetween the members of the two creeds appears then to have been almost\r\nunknown, and the real obstacle to emancipation was not the feelings of\r\nthe people, but the policy of the Government. The Bar may be considered\r\non most subjects a very fair exponent of the educated opinion of the\r\nnation; and Wolf Tone observed, in 1792, that it was almost unanimous in\r\nfavour of the Catholics; and it is not without importance, as showing\r\nthe tendencies of the rising generation, that a large body of the\r\nstudents of Dublin University in 1795 presented an address to Grattan,\r\nthanking him for his labours in the cause. The Roman Catholics were\r\nrapidly gaining the public opinion of Ireland, when the Union arrayed\r\nagainst them another public opinion which was deeply prejudiced against\r\ntheir faith, and almost entirely removed from their influence. Compare\r\nthe twenty years before the Union with the twenty years that followed\r\nit, and the change is sufficiently manifest. There can scarcely be a\r\nquestion that if Lord Fitzwilliam had remained in office the Irish\r\nParliament would readily have given emancipation. In the United\r\nParliament for many years it was obstinately rejected, and if O'Connell\r\nhad never arisen it would probably never have been granted unqualified\r\nby the veto. In 1828 when the question was brought forward in\r\nParliament, sixty-one out of ninety-three Irish members, forty-five out\r\nof sixty-one Irish county members, voted in its favour. Year after year\r\nGrattan and Plunket brought forward the case of their fellow-countrymen\r\nwith an eloquence and a perseverance worthy of their great cause; but\r\nyear after year they were defeated. It was not till the great tribune\r\nhad arisen, till he had moulded his co-religionists into one compact and\r\nthreatening mass, and had brought the country to the verge of\r\nrevolution, that the tardy boon was conceded. Eloquence and argument\r\nproved alike unavailing when unaccompanied by menace, and Catholic\r\nEmancipation was confessedly granted because to withhold it would be to\r\nproduce a rebellion.\"[34]\r\n\r\nMany people will think that this is a sufficiently weighty condemnation\r\nof the Union, but what follows is a still graver reflection on that\r\nuntoward measure.\r\n\r\n\"In truth the harmonious co-operation of Ireland with England depends\r\nmuch less upon the framework of the institutions of the former country\r\nthan upon the dispositions of its people and upon the classes who guide\r\nits political life. With a warm and loyal attachment to the connection\r\npervading the nation, the largest amount of self-government might be\r\nsafely conceded, and the most defective political arrangement might\r\nprove innocuous. This is the true cement of nations, and no change,\r\nhowever plausible in theory, can be really advantageous which\r\ncontributes to diminish it. Theorists may argue that it would be better\r\nfor Ireland to become in every respect a province of England; they may\r\ncontend that a union of Legislatures, accompanied by a corresponding\r\nfusion of characters and identification of hopes, interests, and\r\ndesires, would strengthen the empire; but as a matter of fact this was\r\nnot what was effected in 1800. The measure of Pitt centralized, but it\r\ndid not unite, or rather, by uniting the Legislatures it divided the\r\nnations. In a country where the sentiment of nationality was as intense\r\nas in any part of Europe, it destroyed the national Legislature contrary\r\nto the manifest wish of the people, and by means so corrupt,\r\ntreacherous, and shameful that they are never likely to be forgotten. In\r\na country where, owing to the religious difference, it was peculiarly\r\nnecessary that a vigorous lay public opinion should be fostered to\r\ndilute or restrain the sectarian spirit, it suppressed the centre and\r\norgan of political life, directed the energies of the community into the\r\nchannels of sectarianism, drove its humours inwards, and thus began a\r\nperversion of public opinion which has almost destroyed the elements of\r\npolitical progress. In a country where the people have always been\r\nsingularly destitute of self-reliance, and at the same time eminently\r\nfaithful to their leaders, it withdrew the guidance of affairs from the\r\nhands of the resident gentry, and, by breaking their power, prepared the\r\nascendency of the demagogue or the rebel. In two plain ways it was\r\ndangerous to the connection: it incalculably increased the aggregate\r\ndisloyalty of the people, and it destroyed the political supremacy of\r\nthe class that is most attached to the connection. The Irish Parliament,\r\nwith all its faults, was an eminently loyal body. The Irish people\r\nthrough the eighteenth century, in spite of great provocations, were on\r\nthe whole a loyal people till the recall of Lord Fitzwilliam, and even\r\nthen a few very moderate measures of reform might have reclaimed them.\r\nBurke, in his _Letters on a Regicide Peace_, when reviewing the elements\r\nof strength on which England could confide in her struggle with\r\nrevolutionary France, placed in the very first rank the co-operation of\r\nIreland. At the present day, it is to be feared that most impartial men\r\nwould regard Ireland, in the event of a great European war, rather as a\r\nsource of weakness than of strength. More than seventy years have passed\r\nsince the boasted measure of Pitt, and it is unfortunately incontestable\r\nthat the lower orders in Ireland are as hostile to the system of\r\ngovernment under which they live as the Hungarian people have ever been\r\nto Austrian, or the Roman to Papal rule; that Irish disloyalty is\r\nmultiplying enemies of England wherever the English tongue is spoken;\r\nand that the national sentiment runs so strongly that multitudes of\r\nIrish Catholics look back with deep affection to the Irish Parliament,\r\nalthough no Catholic could sit within its walls, and although it was\r\nonly during the last seven years of its independent existence that\r\nCatholics could vote for its members. Among the opponents of the Union\r\nwere many of the most loyal, as well as nearly all the ablest men in\r\nIreland; and Lord Charlemont, who died shortly before the measure was\r\nconsummated, summed up the feelings of many in the emphatic sentence\r\nwith which he protested against it. 'It would more than any other\r\nmeasure,' he said, 'contribute to the separation of two countries the\r\nperpetual connection of which is one of the warmest wishes of my heart.'\r\n\r\n\"In fact, the Union of 1800 was not only a great crime, but was also,\r\nlike most crimes, a great blunder. The manner in which it was carried\r\nwas not only morally scandalous; it also entirely vitiated it as a work\r\nof statesmanship. No great political measure can be rationally judged\r\nupon its abstract merits, and without considering the character and the\r\nwishes of the people for whom it is intended. It is now idle to discuss\r\nwhat might have been the effect of a Union if it had been carried before\r\n1782, when the Parliament was still unemancipated; if it had been the\r\nresult of a spontaneous movement of public opinion; if it had been\r\naccompanied by the emancipation of the Catholics. Carried as it was\r\nprematurely, in defiance of the national sentiment of the people and of\r\nthe protests of the unbribed talent of the country, it has deranged the\r\nwhole course of political development, driven a large proportion of the\r\npeople into sullen disloyalty, and almost destroyed healthy public\r\nopinion. In comparing the abundance of political talent in Ireland\r\nduring the last century with the striking absence of it at present,\r\nsomething no doubt may be attributed to the absence of protection for\r\nliterary property in Ireland in the former period, which may have\r\ndirected an unusual portion of the national talent to politics, and\r\nsomething to the Colonial and Indian careers which have of late years\r\nbeen thrown open to competition; but when all due allowances have been\r\nmade for these, the contrast is sufficiently impressive. Few impartial\r\nmen can doubt that the tone of political life and the standard of\r\npolitical talent have been lowered, while sectarian animosity has been\r\ngreatly increased, and the extent to which Fenian principles have\r\npermeated the people is a melancholy comment upon the prophesies that\r\nthe Union would put an end to disloyalty in Ireland.\"[35]\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky's views as to what ought to have been done in 1800 deserve to\r\nbe set forth.\r\n\r\n\"While, however, the Irish policy of Pitt appears to be both morally and\r\npolitically deserving of almost unmitigated condemnation, I cannot agree\r\nwith those who believe that the arrangement of 1782 could have been\r\npermanent. The Irish Parliament would doubtless have been in time\r\nreformed, but it would have soon found its situation intolerable.\r\nImperial policy must necessarily have been settled by the Imperial\r\nParliament, in which Ireland had no voice; and, unlike Canada or\r\nAustralia, Ireland is profoundly affected by every change of Imperial\r\npolicy. Connection with England was of overwhelming importance to the\r\nlesser country, while the tie uniting them would have been found\r\ndegrading by one nation and inconvenient to the other. Under such\r\ncircumstances a Union of some kind was inevitable. It was simply a\r\nquestion of time, and must have been demanded by Irish opinion. At the\r\nsame time, it would not, I think, have been such a Union as that of\r\n1800. The conditions of Irish and English politics are so extremely\r\ndifferent, and the reasons for preserving in Ireland a local centre of\r\npolitical life are so powerful, that it is probable a Federal Union\r\nwould have been preferred. Under such a system the Irish Parliament\r\nwould have continued to exist, but would have been restricted to purely\r\nlocal subjects, while an Imperial Parliament, in which Irish\r\nrepresentatives sat, would have directed the policy of the empire.\"[36]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. GOLDWIN SMITH.\r\n\r\nNone of the recent opponents of Home Rule have written against that\r\npolicy with more brilliance and epigrammatic keenness than Mr. Goldwin\r\nSmith. But no one has stated with more force the facts and\r\nconsiderations which, operating on men's mind for years past, have made\r\nthe Liberal party Home Rulers now. His _coup d'oeil_ remains the most\r\npointed indictment ever drawn from the historical annals of Ireland\r\nagainst the English methods of governing that country. Twenty years ago\r\nhe anticipated the advice recently given by Mr. Gladstone. In 1867 he\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I have myself sought and found in the study of Irish history the\r\nexplanation of the paradox, that a people with so many gifts, so\r\namiable, naturally so submissive to rulers, and everywhere but in their\r\nown country industrious, are in their own country bywords of idleness,\r\nlawlessness, disaffection, and agrarian crime.\"[37] He explains the\r\nparadox thus: \"But it is difficult to distinguish the faults of the\r\nIrish from their misfortunes. It has been well said of their past\r\nindustrial character and history,--'We were reckless, ignorant,\r\nimprovident, drunken, and idle. We were idle, for we had nothing to do;\r\nwe were reckless, for we had no hope; we were ignorant, for learning was\r\ndenied us; we were improvident, for we had no future; we were drunken,\r\nfor we sought to forget our misery. That time has passed away for ever.'\r\nNo part of this defence is probably more true than that which connects\r\nthe drunkenness of the Irish people with their misery. Drunkenness is,\r\ngenerally speaking, the vice of despair; and it springs from the despair\r\nof the Irish peasant as rankly as from that of his English fellow. The\r\nsums of money which have lately been transmitted by Irish emigrants to\r\ntheir friends in Ireland seem a conclusive answer to much loose\r\ndenunciation of the national character, both in a moral and an\r\nindustrial point of view.... There seems no good reason for believing\r\nthat the Irish Kelts are averse to labour, provided they be placed, as\r\npeople of all races require to be placed, for two or three generations\r\nin circumstances favourable to industry.\"[38] He shows that the Irish\r\nhave not been so placed. \"Still more does justice require that allowance\r\nshould be made on historical grounds for the failings of the Irish\r\npeople. If they are wanting in industry, in regard for the rights of\r\nproperty, in reverence for the law, history furnishes a full explanation\r\nof their defects, without supposing in them any inherent depravity, or\r\neven any inherent weakness. They have never had the advantage of the\r\ntraining through which other nations have passed in their gradual rise\r\nfrom barbarism to civilization. The progress of the Irish people was\r\narrested at almost a primitive stage, and a series of calamities,\r\nfollowing close upon each other, have prevented it from ever fairly\r\nresuming its course. The pressure of overwhelming misery has now been\r\nreduced; government has become mild and just; the civilizing agency of\r\neducation has been introduced; the upper classes are rapidly returning\r\nto their duty, and the natural effect is at once seen in the improved\r\ncharacter of the people. Statesmen are bound to be well acquainted with\r\nthe historical sources of the evil with which they have to deal,\r\nespecially when those evils are of such a nature as, at first aspect, to\r\nimply depravity in a nation. There are still speakers and writers who\r\nseem to think that the Irish are incurably vicious, because the\r\naccumulated effects of so many centuries cannot be removed at once by a\r\nwave of the legislator's wand. Some still believe, or affect to believe,\r\nthat the very air of the island is destructive of the characters and\r\nunderstandings of all who breathe it.\"[39]\r\n\r\nElsewhere he adds, referring to the land system:\r\n\r\n\"How many centuries of a widely different training have the English\r\npeople gone through in order to acquire their boasted love of law.\"[40]\r\n\r\nOf the \"training\" through which the Irish went, he says--\r\n\r\n\"The existing settlement of land in Ireland, whether dating from the\r\nconfiscations of the Stuarts, or from those of Cromwell, rests on a\r\nproscription three or four times as long as that on which the settlement\r\nof land rests over a considerable part of France. It may, therefore, be\r\nconsidered as placed upon discussion in the estimation of all sane men;\r\nand, this being the case, it is safe to observe that no inherent want of\r\nrespect for property is shown by the Irish people if a proprietorship\r\nwhich had its origin within historical memory in flagrant wrong is less\r\nsacred in their eyes than it would be if it had its origin in immemorial\r\nright.\"[41]\r\n\r\nThe character which he gives of Irish landlordism deserves to be quoted:\r\n\r\n\"The Cromwellian landowners soon lost their religious character, while\r\nthey retained all the hardness of the fanatic and the feelings of\r\nPuritan conquerors towards a conquered Catholic people. 'I have eaten\r\nwith them,' said one, 'drunk with them, fought with them; but I never\r\nprayed with them.' Their descendants became, probably, the very worst\r\nupper class with which a country was ever afflicted. The habits of the\r\nIrish gentry grew beyond measure brutal and reckless, and the coarseness\r\nof their debaucheries would have disgusted the crew of Comus. Their\r\ndrunkenness, their blasphemy, their ferocious duelling, left the squires\r\nof England far behind. If there was a grotesque side to their vices\r\nwhich mingles laughter with our reprobation, this did not render their\r\ninfluence less pestilent to the community of which the motive of destiny\r\nhad made them social chiefs. Fortunately, their recklessness was sure,\r\nin the end, to work, to a certain extent, its own cure; and in the\r\nbackground of their swinish and uproarious drinking-bouts, the\r\nEncumbered Estates Act rises to our view.\"[42]\r\n\r\nMr. Goldwin Smith deals with agrarian crime thus:\r\n\r\n\"The atrocities perpetrated by the Whiteboys, especially in the earlier\r\nperiod of agrarianism (for they afterwards grew somewhat less inhuman),\r\nare such as to make the flesh creep. No language can be too strong in\r\nspeaking of the horrors of such a state of society. But it would be\r\nunjust to confound these agrarian conspiracies with ordinary crime, or\r\nto suppose that they imply a propensity to ordinary crime either on the\r\npart of those who commit them, or on the part of the people who connive\r\nat and favour their commission. In the districts where agrarian\r\nconspiracy and outrage were most rife, the number of ordinary crimes was\r\nvery small. In Munster, in 1833, out of 973 crimes, 627 were Whiteboy,\r\nor agrarian, and even of the remainder, many, being crimes of violence,\r\nwere probably committed from the same motive.\r\n\r\n\"In plain truth, the secret tribunals which administered the Whiteboy\r\ncode were to the people the organs of a wild law of social morality by\r\nwhich, on the whole, the interest of the peasant was protected. They\r\nwere not regular tribunals; neither were the secret tribunals of Germany\r\nin the Middle Ages, the existence of which, and the submission of the\r\npeople to their jurisdiction, implied the presence of much violence, but\r\nnot of much depravity, considering the wildness of the times. The\r\nWhiteboys 'found in their favour already existing a general and settled\r\nhatred of the law among the great body of the peasantry.'[43] We have\r\nseen how much the law, and the ministers of the law, had done to deserve\r\nthe peasant's love. We have seen, too, in what successive guises\r\nproperty had presented itself to his mind: first as open rapine; then as\r\nrobbery carried on through the roguish technicalities of an alien code;\r\nfinally as legalized and systematic oppression. Was it possible that he\r\nshould have formed so affectionate a reverence either for law or\r\nproperty as would be proof against the pressure of starvation?\"[44] \"A\r\npeople cannot be expected to love and reverence oppression because it is\r\nconsigned to the statute-book, and called law.\"[45]\r\n\r\nThese extracts are taken from _Irish History and Irish Character_, which\r\nwas published in 1861. But in 1867 Mr. Goldwin Smith wrote a series of\r\nletters to the _Daily News_, which were republished in 1868 under the\r\ntitle of _The Irish Question_; and these letters form, perhaps, the most\r\nstatesmanlike and far-seeing pronouncement that has ever been made on\r\nthe Irish difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the preface Mr. Goldwin Smith begins:\r\n\r\n\"The Irish legislation of the last forty years, notwithstanding the\r\nadoption of some remedial measures, has failed through the indifference\r\nof Parliament to the sentiments of Irishmen; and the harshness of\r\nEnglish public opinion has embittered the effects on Irish feeling of\r\nthe indifference of Parliament. Occasionally a serious effort has been\r\nmade by an English statesman to induce Parliament to approach Irish\r\nquestions in that spirit of sympathy, and with that anxious desire to be\r\njust, without which a Parliament in London cannot legislate wisely for\r\nIreland. Such efforts have hitherto met with no response; is it too much\r\nto hope that it will be otherwise in the year now opening?\"[46]\r\n\r\nThe only comment I shall make on these words is: they were penned more\r\nthan half a century after Mr. Pitt's Union, which was to shower down\r\nblessings on the Irish people.\r\n\r\nMr. Goldwin Smith's first letter was written on the 23rd of November,\r\n1867, the day of the execution of the Fenians Allen, Larkin, and\r\nO'Brien. He says--\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt, I apprehend, that the Irish difficulty has\r\nentered on a new phase, and that Irish disaffection has, to repeat an\r\nexpression which I heard used in Ireland, come fairly into a line with\r\nthe other discontented nationalities of Europe. Active Fenianism\r\nprobably pervades only the lowest class; passive sympathy, which the\r\nsuccess of the movement would at once convert into active co-operation,\r\nextends, it is to be feared, a good deal higher.\r\n\r\n\"England has ruin before her, unless she can hit on a remedy, and\r\novercome any obstacles of class interest or of national pride which\r\nwould prevent its application, the part of Russia in Poland, or of\r\nAustria in Italy--a part cruel, hateful, demoralizing, contrary to all\r\nour high principles and professions, and fraught with dangers to our own\r\nfreedom. Our position will be worse than that of Russia in this respect,\r\nthat, while her Poland is only a province, our Fenianism is an element\r\npervading every city of the United Kingdom in which Irish abound, and\r\nallying itself with kindred misery, discontent, and disorder.\r\nWretchedness, the result of misgovernment, has caused the Irish people\r\nto multiply with the recklessness of despair, and now here are their\r\navenging hosts in the midst of us, here is the poison of their\r\ndisaffection running through every member of our social frame. Not only\r\nso, but the same wretchedness has sent millions of emigrants to form an\r\nIrish nation in the United States, where the Irish are a great political\r\npower, swaying by their votes the councils of the American Republic, and\r\nin immediate contact with those Transatlantic possessions of England,\r\nthe retention of which it is now patriotic to applaud, and will one day\r\nbe patriotic to have dissuaded.\r\n\r\n\" ... That Ireland is not at this moment, materially speaking, in a\r\nparticularly suffering state, but, on the contrary, the farmers are\r\nrather prosperous, and wages, even when allowance is made for the rise\r\nin the price of provisions, considerably higher than they were, only\r\nadds to the significance of this widespread disaffection.\r\n\r\n\"The Fenian movement is not religious, nor radically economical (though\r\nno doubt it has in it a socialistic element), but national, and the\r\nremedy for it must be one which cures national discontent. This is the\r\ngreat truth which the English people have to lay to heart.\"[47]\r\n\r\nMr. Goldwin Smith then dispels the notion that the Irish question is a\r\nreligious one.\r\n\r\n\"When Fenianism first appeared, the Orangemen, in accordance with their\r\nfixed idea, ascribed it to the priests. They were undeceived, I was\r\ntold, by seeing a priest run away from the Fenians in fear of his\r\nlife.\"[48]\r\n\r\nNeither was it a question of the land.\r\n\r\n\"The land question, no doubt, lies nearer to the heart of the matter,\r\nand it is the great key to Irish history in the past; but I do not\r\nbelieve that even this is fundamental.\"\r\n\r\nHe then states what is \"fundamental.\"[49]\r\n\r\n\"The real root of the disaffection which exhibits itself at present in\r\nthe guise of Fenianism, and which has been suddenly kindled into flame\r\nby the arming of the Irish in the American civil war, but which existed\r\nbefore in a nameless and smouldering state, is, as I believe, the want\r\nof national institutions, of a national capital, of any objects of\r\nnational reverence and attachment, and consequently of anything\r\ndeserving to be called national life. The English Crown and Parliament\r\nthe Irish have never learnt, nor have they had any chance of learning,\r\nto love, or to regard as national, notwithstanding the share which was\r\ngiven them, too late, in the representation. The greatness of England is\r\nnothing to them. Her history is nothing, or worse. The success of\r\nIrishmen in London consoles the Irish in Ireland no more than the\r\nsuccess of Italian adventurers in foreign countries (which was very\r\nremarkable) consoled the Italian people. The drawing off of Irish\r\ntalent, in fact, turns to an additional grievance in their minds. Dublin\r\nis a modern Tara, a metropolis from which the glory has departed; and\r\nthe viceroyalty, though it pleases some of the tradesmen, fails\r\naltogether to satisfy the people. 'In Ireland we can make no appeal to\r\npatriotism, we can have no patriotic sentiments in our schoolbooks, no\r\npatriotic emblems in our schools, because in Ireland everything\r\npatriotic is rebellious.' These were the words uttered in my hearing,\r\nnot by a complaining demagogue, but by a desponding statesman. They\r\nseemed to me pregnant with fatal truths.\r\n\r\n\"If the craving for national institutions, and the disaffection bred in\r\nthis void of the Irish people's heart, seem to us irrational and even\r\ninsane, in the absence of any more substantial grievance, we ought to\r\nask ourselves what would become of our own patriotism if we had no\r\nnational institutions, no objects of national loyalty and reverence,\r\neven though we might be pretty well governed, at least in intention, by\r\na neighbouring people whom we regarded as aliens, and who, in fact,\r\nregarded us pretty much in the same light. Let us first judge ourselves\r\nfairly, and then judge the Irish, remembering always that they are more\r\nimaginative and sentimental, and need some centre of national feeling\r\nand affection more than ourselves.\"[50]\r\n\r\nAnd all this was written sixty-seven years after the Union of 1800.\r\n\r\nMr. Goldwin Smith then deals with the subject of the Irish and Scotch\r\nunions much in the same way as Mr. Lecky.\r\n\r\n\"The incorporation of the Scotch nation with the English, being\r\nconducted on the right principles by the great Whig statesman of Anne,\r\nhas been perfectly successful. The attempt to incorporate the Irish\r\nnation with the English and Scotch, the success of which would have\r\nbeen, if possible, a still greater blessing, being conducted by very\r\ndifferent people and on very different principles, has unhappily failed.\r\nWhat might have been the result if even the Hanoverian sovereigns had\r\ndone the personal duty to their Irish kingdom which they have\r\nunfortunately neglected, it is now too late to inquire. The Irish Union\r\nhas missed its port, and, in order to reach it, will have to tack again.\r\nWe may hold down a dependency, of course, by force, in Russian and\r\nAustrian fashion; but force will never make the hearts of two nations\r\none, especially when they are divided by the sea. Once get rid of this\r\ndeadly international hatred, and there will be hope of real union in the\r\nfuture.\"[51]\r\n\r\nMr. Goldwin Smith finally proposes a \"plan\" by which the \"deadly\r\ninternational hatred\" might be got rid of, and a \"real union\" brought\r\nabout. Here it is.\r\n\r\n\"1. The residence of the Court at Dublin, not merely to gratify the\r\npopular love of royalty and its pageantries, which no man of sense\r\ndesires to stimulate, but to assure the Irish people, in the only way\r\npossible as regards the mass of them, that the sovereign of the United\r\nKingdom is really their sovereign, and that they are equally cared for\r\nand honoured with the other subjects of the realm. This would also tend\r\nto make Dublin a real capital, and to gather and retain there a portion\r\nof the Irish talent which now seeks its fortune elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"2. An occasional session (say once in every three years) of the\r\nImperial Parliament in Dublin, partly for the same purposes as the last\r\nproposal, but also because the circumstances of Ireland are likely to\r\nbe, for some time at least, really peculiar, and the personal\r\nacquaintance of our legislators with them is the only sufficient\r\nsecurity for good Irish legislation. There could be no serious\r\ndifficulty in holding a short session in the Irish capital, where there\r\nis plenty of accommodation for both Houses.\r\n\r\n\"3. A liberal measure of local self-government for Ireland. I would not\r\nvest the power in any single assembly for all Ireland, because Ulster is\r\nreally a different country from the other provinces. I would give each\r\nprovince a council of its own, and empower that council to legislate\r\n(subject, of course, to the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament) on all\r\nmatters not essential to the political and legal unity of the empire, in\r\nwhich I would include local education. The provincial councils should of\r\ncourse be elective, and the register of electors might be the same as\r\nthat of electors to the Imperial Parliament. In England itself the\r\nextension of local institutions, as political training schools for the\r\nmasses, as checks upon the sweeping action of the great central\r\nassembly, and as the best organs of legislation in all matters requiring\r\n(as popular education, among others, does) adaptation to the\r\ncircumstances of particular districts, would, I think, have formed a\r\npart of any statesmanlike revision of our political system. Here, also,\r\nmuch good might be done, and much evil averted, by committing the\r\npresent business of quarter sessions, other than the judicial business,\r\ntogether with such other matters as the central legislative might think\r\nfit to vest in local hands, to an assembly elected by the county.\"[52]\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that twenty years ago Mr. Goldwin Smith anticipated\r\nMr. Chamberlain's scheme of provincial councils, and got a good way on\r\nthe road to an Irish Parliament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. DICEY.\r\n\r\nA fairer controversalist, or an abler supporter of the \"paper Union,\"\r\nthan Mr. Dicey there is not; nevertheless no man has fired more\r\neffective shots into Mr. Pitt's unfortunate arrangement of 1800.\r\n\r\nHow well has the \"failure\" of that arrangement been described in these\r\npithy sentences--\"Eighty-six years have elapsed since the conclusion of\r\nthe Treaty of Union between England and Ireland. The two countries do\r\nnot yet form an united nation. The Irish people are, if not more\r\nwretched (for the whole European world has made progress, and Ireland\r\nwith it), yet more conscious of wretchedness, and Irish disaffection to\r\nEngland is, if not deeper, more widespread than in 1800. An Act meant by\r\nits authors to be a source of the prosperity and concord which, though\r\nslowly, followed upon the Union with Scotland, has not made Ireland\r\nrich, has not put an end to Irish lawlessness, has not terminated the\r\nfeud between Protestants and Catholics, has not raised the position of\r\nIrish tenants, has not taken away the causes of Irish discontent, and\r\nhas, therefore, not removed Irish disloyalty. This is the indictment\r\nwhich can fairly be brought against the Act of Union.\"[53]\r\n\r\nWhat follows reflects honour on Mr. Dicey as an honest opponent who does\r\nnot shrink from facts; but what a wholesale condemnation of the policy\r\nof the Imperial Parliament!\r\n\r\n\"On one point alone (it may be urged) all men, of whatever party or of\r\nwhatever nation, who have seriously studied the annals of Ireland are\r\nagreed--the history is a record of incessant failure on the part of the\r\nGovernment, and of incessant misery on the part of the people. On this\r\nmatter, if on no other, De Beaumont, Froude, and Lecky are at one. As to\r\nthe guilt of the failure or the cause of the misery, men may and do\r\ndiffer; that England, whether from her own fault or the fault of the\r\nIrish people, or from perversity of circumstances, has failed in Ireland\r\nof achieving the elementary results of good government is as certain as\r\nany fact of history or of experience. Every scheme has been tried in\r\nturn, and no scheme has succeeded or has even, it may be suggested,\r\nproduced its natural effects. Oppression of the Catholics has increased\r\nthe adherents and strengthened the hold of Catholicism. Protestant\r\nsupremacy, while it lasted, did not lead even to Protestant contentment,\r\nand the one successful act of resistance to the English dominion was\r\neffected by a Protestant Parliament supported by an army of volunteers,\r\nled by a body of Protestant officers. The independence gained by a\r\nProtestant Parliament led, after eighteen years, to a rebellion so\r\nreckless and savage that it caused, if it did not justify, the\r\ndestruction of the Parliament and the carrying of the Union. The Act of\r\nUnion did not lead to national unity, and a measure which appeared on\r\nthe face of it (though the appearance, it must be admitted, was\r\ndelusive) to be a copy of the law which bound England and Scotland into\r\na common country inspired by common patriotism, produced conspiracy and\r\nagitation, and at last placed England and Ireland further apart,\r\nmorally, than they stood at the beginning of the century. The Treaty of\r\nUnion, it was supposed, missed its mark because it was not combined with\r\nCatholic Emancipation. The Catholics were emancipated, but emancipation,\r\ninstead of producing loyalty, brought forth the cry for repeal. The\r\nRepeal movement ended in failure, but its death gave birth to the\r\nattempted rebellion in 1848. Suppressed rebellion begot Fenianism, to be\r\nfollowed in its turn by the agitation for Home Rule. The movement\r\nrelies, it is said, and there is truth in the assertion, on\r\nconstitutional methods for obtaining redress. But constitutional\r\nmeasures are supplemented by boycotting, by obstruction, by the use of\r\ndynamite. A century of reform has given us Mr. Parnell instead of\r\nGrattan, and it is more than possible that Mr. Parnell may be succeeded\r\nby leaders in whose eyes Mr. Davitt's policy may appear to be tainted\r\nwith moderation. No doubt, in each case the failure of good measures\r\nadmits, like every calamity in public or private life, of explanation,\r\nand after the event it is easy to see why, for example, the Poor Law,\r\nwhen extended to Ireland, did not produce even the good effects such as\r\nthey are which in England are to be set against its numerous evils; or\r\nwhy an emigration of unparalleled proportions has diminished population\r\nwithout much diminishing poverty; why the disestablishment of the\r\nAnglican Church has increased rather than diminished the hostility to\r\nEngland of the Catholic priesthood; or why two Land Acts have not\r\ncontented Irish farmers. It is easy enough, in short, and this without\r\nhaving any recourse to theory of race, and without attributing to\r\nIreland either more or less of original sin than falls to the lot of\r\nhumanity, to see how it is that imperfect statesmanship--and all\r\nstatesmanship, it should be remembered, is imperfect--has failed in\r\nobtaining good results at all commensurate with its generally good\r\nintentions. Failure, however, is none the less failure because its\r\ncauses admit of analysis. It is no defence to bankruptcy that an\r\ninsolvent can, when brought before the Court, lucidly explain the errors\r\nwhich resulted in disastrous speculations. The failure of English\r\nstatesmanship, explain it as you will, has produced the one last and\r\ngreatest evil which misgovernment can cause. It has created hostility to\r\nthe law in the minds of the people. The law cannot work in Ireland\r\nbecause the classes whose opinion in other countries supports the\r\nactions of the courts, are in Ireland, even when not law-breakers, in\r\nfull sympathy with law-breakers.\"[54]\r\n\r\nNo Home Ruler has described the evils of English misrule in Ireland with\r\nsuch vigour as this.\r\n\r\n\"Bad administration, religious persecution, above all, a thoroughly\r\nvicious land tenure, accompanied by such sweeping confiscations as to\r\nmake it, at any rate, a plausible assertion that all land in Ireland has\r\nduring the course of Irish history been confiscated at least thrice\r\nover, are admittedly some of the causes, if they do not constitute the\r\nwhole cause, of the one immediate difficulty which perplexes the policy\r\nof England. This is nothing else than the admitted disaffection to the\r\nlaw of the land prevailing among large numbers of Irish people. The\r\nexistence of this disaffection, whatever be the inference to be drawn\r\nfrom it, is undeniable. A series of so-called Coercion Acts, passed both\r\nbefore and since the Act of Union, give undeniable evidence, if evidence\r\nwere wanted, of the ceaseless and, as it would appear, almost\r\nirrepressible resistance in Ireland offered by the people to the\r\nenforcement of the law. I have not the remotest inclination to underrate\r\nthe lasting and formidable character of this opposition between opinion\r\nand law, nor can any jurist who wishes to deal seriously with a serious\r\nand infinitely painful topic, question for a moment that the ultimate\r\nstrength of law lies in the sympathy, or at the lowest the acquiescence,\r\nof the mass of the population. Judges, constables, and troops become\r\nalmost powerless when the conscience of the people permanently opposes\r\nthe execution of the law. Severity produces either no effect or bad\r\neffects; executed criminals are regarded as heroes or martyrs; and\r\njurymen and witnesses meet with the execration and often with the fate\r\nof criminals. On such a point it is best to take the opinion of a\r\nforeigner unaffected by prejudices or passions from which no Englishman\r\nor Irishman has a right to suppose himself free.\r\n\r\n\"'Quand vous en êtes arroês à ce point, croyez bien que dans cette voie\r\nde regueurs tous vos efforts pour rétabler l'ordre et la paix seront\r\ninutiles. En vain, pour réprimer des crimes atroces, vous appellerez à\r\nvotre aide toutes les sévérités du code de Dracon; en vain vous ferez\r\ndes lois cruelles pour arrêter le cours de révoltantes cruautés;\r\nvainement vous frapperez de mort le moindre délit se rattachant à ces\r\ngrands crimes; vainement, dans l'effroi de votre impuissance, vous\r\nsuspendrez le cours des lois ordinaries proclamerez des comtés entiers\r\nen état de suspicion légale, voilerez le principe de la liberté\r\nindividuelle, créerez des cours martiales, des commissions\r\nextraordinaires, et pour produire de salutaires impressions de terreur,\r\nmultiplierez à l'excès les exécutions capitales.'\"[55]\r\n\r\nThe next passage is a trenchant condemnation of the \"Union.\"\r\n\r\n\"There exists in Europe no country so completely at unity with itself as\r\nGreat Britain. Fifty years of reform have done their work, and have\r\nremoved the discontents, the divisions, the disaffection, and the\r\nconspiracies which marked the first quarter, or the first half of this\r\ncentury. Great Britain, if left to herself, could act with all the\r\nforce, consistency, and energy given by unity of sentiment and community\r\nof interests. The distraction and the uncertainty of our political aims,\r\nthe feebleness and inconsistency with which they are pursued, arise, in\r\npart at least, from the connection with Ireland. Neither Englishmen nor\r\nIrishmen are to blame for the fact that it is difficult for communities\r\ndiffering in historical associations and in political conceptions to\r\nkeep step together in the path of progress. For other evils arising from\r\nthe connection the blame must rest on English Statesmen. All the\r\ninherent vices of party government, all the weaknesses of the\r\nparliamentary system, all the evils arising from the perverse notion\r\nthat reform ought always to be preceded by a period of lengthy and more\r\nthan half factitious agitation met by equally factitious resistance,\r\nhave been fostered and increased by the interaction of Irish and English\r\npolitics. No one can believe that the inveterate habit of ruling one\r\npart of the United Kingdom on principles which no one would venture to\r\napply to the government of any other part of it, can have produced\r\nanything but the most injurious effect on the stability of our\r\nGovernment and the character of our public men. The advocates of Home\r\nRule find by far their strongest arguments for influencing English\r\nopinion, in the proofs which they produce that England, no less than\r\nIreland, has suffered from a political arrangement under which legal\r\nunion has failed to secure moral union. _These arguments, whatever their\r\nstrength, are, however, it must be noted, more available to a\r\nNationalist than to an advocate of federalism_.\"[56]\r\n\r\nThe words which I have italicised are an expression of opinion; but\r\nnothing can alter the damning statement of fact--\"legal union has failed\r\nto secure moral union.\" Nevertheless, Mr. Dicey advocates the\r\nmaintenance of this legal union as it stands.\r\n\r\n\"On the whole, then, it appears that, whatever changes or calamities the\r\nfuture may have in store, the maintenance of the Union is at this day\r\nthe one sound policy for England to pursue. It is sound because it is\r\nexpedient; it is sound because it is just.\"[57]\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall not discuss the question of Home Rule with the eminent writers\r\nwhose works I have cited. It is enough that they demonstrate the failure\r\nof the Union. So convinced was Mr. Lecky, in 1871, of its failure, that\r\nhe suggested a readjustment of the relations of the two countries on a\r\nfederal basis;[58] and Mr. Goldwin Smith, in 1868, contended that the\r\nIrish difficulty could only be settled by the establishment of\r\nProvincial Councils, and an occasional session of the Imperial\r\nParliament in Dublin. Mr. Dicey clings to the existing Union while\r\ndemonstrating its failure, because he has persuaded himself that the\r\nonly alternative is separation.\r\n\r\nIrishmen may be pardoned for acting on Mr. Dicey's facts, and\r\ndisregarding his prophecies. The mass of Irishmen believe, with Grattan,\r\nthat the ocean protests against separation as the sea protests against\r\nsuch a union as was attempted in 1800.[59]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Omissions here and elsewhere are merely for purposes of\r\nspace.

Confederate unions.\r\n    2. Federal unions.\r\n    3. Imperial unions.\r\n\r\nA confederate union may be defined to mean an alliance between the\r\ngovernments of independent States, which agree to appoint a common\r\nsuperior authority having power to make peace and war and to demand\r\ncontributions of men and money from the confederate States. Such\r\nsuperior authority has no power of enforcing its decrees except through\r\nthe medium of the governments of the constituent States; or, in other\r\nwords, in case of disobedience, by armed force.\r\n\r\nA federal union differs from a confederate union in the material fact\r\nthat the common superior authority, instead of acting on the individual\r\nsubjects of the constituent States through the medium of their\r\nrespective governments, has a power, in respect of all matters within\r\nits jurisdiction, of enacting laws and issuing orders which are binding\r\ndirectly on the individual citizens.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characteristics of an imperial union are, that it\r\nconsists of an aggregate of communities, one of which is dominant, and\r\nthat the component communities have been brought into association, not\r\nby arrangement between themselves, but by colonization, cession, and by\r\nother means emanating from the resources or power of the dominant\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned distinction between a Government having communities\r\nonly for its subjects, and incapable of enforcing its orders by any\r\nother means than war, and a Government acting directly on individuals,\r\nmust be constantly borne in mind, for in this lies the whole difference\r\nbetween a confederate and federal union; that is to say, between a\r\nconfederacy which, in the case of the United States, lasted a few short\r\nyears, and a federal union which, with the same people as subjects, has\r\nlasted nearly a century, and has stood the strain of the most terrible\r\nwar of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe material features of the Constitution of the United States have been\r\nexplained in a previous article.[61] All that is necessary to call to\r\nmind here is, that the Government of the United States exercises a power\r\nof taxation throughout the whole Union by means of its own officers, and\r\nenforces its decrees through the medium of its own Courts. A Supreme\r\nCourt has also been established, which has power to adjudicate on the\r\nconstitutionality of all laws passed by the Legislature of the United\r\nStates, or of any State, and to decide on all international questions.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland was till 1848 an example of a confederate union or league of\r\nsemi-independent States, which, unlike other confederacies, had existed\r\nwith partial interruptions for centuries. This unusual vitality is\r\nattributed by Mill[62] to the circumstance that the confederate\r\ngovernment felt its weakness so strongly that it hardly ever attempted\r\nto exercise any real authority. Its present government, finally settled\r\nin 1874, but based on fundamental laws passed in 1848, is a federal\r\nunion formed on the pattern of the American Constitution. It consists of\r\na federal assembly comprising two Chambers--the Upper Chamber composed\r\nof forty-four members chosen by the twenty-two cantons, two for each\r\ncanton; the Lower consisting of 145 members chosen by direct election at\r\nthe rate of one deputy for every 20,000 persons. The chief executive\r\nauthority is deputed to a federal council consisting of seven members\r\nelected for three years by the federal assembly, and having at their\r\nhead a president and vice-president, who are the first magistrates of\r\nthe republic. There is also a federal tribunal, having similar functions\r\nto those of the supreme court of the United States of America,\r\nconsisting of nine members elected for six years by the federal\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nThe Empire of Germany is a federal union, differing from the United\r\nStates and Switzerland in having an hereditary emperor as its head. It\r\ncomprises twenty-six States, who have \"formed an eternal union for the\r\nprotection of the realm, and the care of the welfare of the German\r\npeople.\"[63] The King of Prussia, under the title of German Emperor,\r\nrepresents the empire in all its relations to foreign nations, and has\r\nthe power of making peace and war, but if the war be more than a\r\ndefensive war he must have the assent of the Upper House. The\r\nlegislative body of the empire consists of two Houses--the Upper, called\r\nthe Bundesrath, representing the several component States in different\r\nproportions according to their relative importance; the lower, the\r\nReichstag, elected by the voters in 397 electoral districts, which are\r\ndistributed amongst the constituent States in unequal numbers, regard\r\nbeing had to the population and circumstances of each State.\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire is a federal union, differing alike in its\r\norigin and construction from the federal unions above mentioned. In the\r\nbeginning Austria and Hungary were independent countries--Austria a\r\ndespotism, Hungary a constitutional monarchy, with ancient laws and\r\ncustoms dating back to the foundation of the kingdom in 895. In the\r\nsixteenth century the supreme power in both countries--that is to say,\r\nthe despotic monarchy in Austria and the constitutional monarchy in\r\nHungary--became vested in the same person; as might have been\r\nanticipated, the union was not a happy one. If we dip into Heeren's\r\n_Political System of Europe_ at intervals selected almost at random, the\r\nfollowing notices will be found in relation to Austria and\r\nHungary:--Between 1671 and 1700 \"political unity in the Austrian\r\nmonarchy was to have been enforced especially in the principal country\r\n(Hungary), for this was regarded as the sole method of establishing\r\npower; the consequence was an almost perpetual revolutionary state of\r\naffairs.\"[64] Again, in the next chapter, commenting on the period\r\nbetween 1740 and 1786: \"Hungary, in fact the chief, was treated like a\r\nconquered province; subjected to the most oppressive commercial\r\nrestraints, it was regarded as a colony from which Austria exacted what\r\nshe could for her own advantage. The injurious consequences of this\r\ninternal discord are evident.\" Coming to modern times we find that\r\noppression followed oppression with sickening monotony, and that at last\r\nthe determination of Austria to stamp out the Constitution in Hungary\r\ngave rise to the insurrection of 1849, which Austria suppressed with the\r\nassistance of Russia, and as a penalty declared the Hungarian\r\nConstitution to be forfeited, and thereupon Hungary was incorporated\r\nwith Austria, as Ireland was incorporated with Great Britain in 1800.\r\nBoth events were the consequences of unsuccessful rebellions; but the\r\njunction which, in the case of Hungary, was enforced by the sword, was\r\nin Ireland more smoothly carried into effect by corruption. Hungary,\r\nsullen and discontented, waited for Austria's calamity as her\r\nopportunity, and it came after the battle of Sadowa. Austria had just\r\nemerged from a fearful conflict, and Count Beust[65] felt that unless\r\nsome resolute effort was made to meet the views of the constitutional\r\nparty in Hungary, the dismemberment of the empire must be the result.\r\nNow, what was the course he took? Was it a tightening of the bonds\r\nbetween Austria and Hungary? On the contrary, to maintain the unity of\r\nthe empire he dissolved its union and restored to Hungary its ancient\r\nconstitutional privileges. Austria and Hungary each had its own\r\nParliament for local purposes. To manage the imperial concerns of peace\r\nand war, and the foreign relations, a controlling body, called the\r\nDelegations, was established, consisting of 120 members, of whom half\r\nrepresent and are chosen by the Legislature of Austria, and the other\r\nhalf by that of Hungary; the Upper House of each country returning\r\ntwenty members, and the Lower House forty.[66] Ordinarily the delegates\r\nsit and vote in two Chambers, but if they disagree the two branches\r\nmust meet together and give their final vote without debate, which is\r\nbinding on the whole empire.[67]\r\n\r\nThe question arises, What is the magnetic influence which induces\r\ncommunities of men to combine together in federal unions? Undoubtedly it\r\nis the feeling of nationality; and what is nationality? Mr. Mill\r\nsays,[68] \"a portion of mankind may be said to constitute a nationality\r\nif they are united among themselves by common sympathies which do not\r\nexist between them and any others; which make them co-operate with each\r\nother more willingly than other people; desire to be under the same\r\ngovernment, and desire that it should be a government by themselves or a\r\nportion of themselves exclusively.\" He then proceeds to state that the\r\nfeeling of nationality may have been generated by various causes.\r\nSometimes it is the identity of race and descent; community of language\r\nand community of religion greatly contribute to it; geographical limits\r\nare one of its causes; but the strongest of all is identity of political\r\nantecedents: the possession of a national history and consequent\r\ncommunity of recollections--collective pride and humiliation, pleasure\r\nand regret--connected with the same incidents in the past.\r\n\r\nThe only point to be noted further in reference to the foregoing federal\r\nunions, is that the same feeling of nationality which, in the United\r\nStates, Switzerland, and the German Empire, produced a closer legal bond\r\nof union, in the case of Austria-Hungary operated to dissolve the\r\namalgamation formed in 1849 of the two States, and to produce a federal\r\nunion of States in place of a single State.\r\n\r\nOne conclusion seems to follow irresistibly from any review of the\r\nconstruction of the various States above described: that the stability\r\nof a nation bears no relation whatever to the legal compactness or\r\nhomogeneity of its component parts. Russia and France, the most compact\r\npolitical societies in Europe, do not, to say the least, rest on a\r\nfirmer basis than Germany and Switzerland, the inhabitants of which are\r\nsubjected to the obligations of a double nationality. Above all, no\r\nEuropean nation, except Great Britain, can for a moment bear comparison\r\nwith the United States in respect of the devotion of its people to their\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nAn imperial union, though resembling somewhat in outward form a federal\r\nunion, differs altogether from it both in principle and origin. Its\r\nessential characteristic is that one community is absolutely dominant\r\nwhile all the others are subordinate. In the case of a federal union\r\nindependent States have agreed to resign a portion of their powers to a\r\ncentral Government for the sake of securing the common safety. In an\r\nimperial union the dominant or imperial State delegates to each\r\nconstituent member of the union such a portion of local government as\r\nthe dominant State considers the subordinate member entitled to,\r\nconsistently with the integrity of the empire. The British Empire\r\nfurnishes the best example of an imperial union now existing in the\r\nworld. Her Majesty, as common head, is the one link which binds the\r\nempire together and connects with each other every constituent member.\r\nThe Indian Empire and certain military dependencies require no further\r\nnotice in these pages; but a summary of our various forms of colonial\r\ngovernment is required to complete our knowledge of the forms of Home\r\nRule possibly applicable to Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe colonies, in relation to their forms of government, may be\r\nclassified as follows:--\r\n\r\nI. Crown colonies, in which laws may be made by the Governor alone, or\r\nwith the concurrence of a Council nominated by the Crown.\r\n\r\n2. Colonies possessing representative institutions, but not responsible\r\ngovernment, in which the Crown has only a veto on legislation, but the\r\nHome Government retains the control of the executive.\r\n\r\n3. Colonies possessing representative institutions and responsible\r\ngovernment, in which the Crown has only a veto on legislation, and the\r\nHome Government has no control over any public officer except the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nThe British Colonial Governments thus present an absolute gradation of\r\nrule; beginning with absolute despotism and ending with almost absolute\r\nlegal independence, except in so far as a veto on legislation and the\r\npresence of a Governor named by the Crown mark the dependence of the\r\ncolony on the mother country.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered, moreover, that the colonies which have received\r\nthis complete local freedom are the great colonies of the earth--nations\r\nthemselves possessing territories as large or larger than any European\r\nState--namely, Canada, the Cape, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland,\r\nSouth Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania. And this change from dependence\r\nto freedom has been effected with the good-will both of the mother\r\ncountry and the colony, and without it being imputed to the colonists,\r\nwhen desiring a larger measure of self-government, that they were\r\nseparatists, anarchists, or revolutionists.\r\n\r\nSuch are the general principles of colonial government, but one colony\r\nrequires special mention, from the circumstance of its Constitution\r\nhaving been put forward as a model for Ireland; this is the Dominion of\r\nCanada. The Government of Canada is, in effect, a subordinate federal\r\nunion; that is to say, it possesses a central Legislature, having the\r\nlargest possible powers of local self-government consistent with the\r\nsupremacy of the empire, with seven inferior provincial Governments,\r\nexercising powers greater than those of an English county, but not so\r\ngreat as those of an American State. The advantage of such a form of\r\ngovernment is that, without weakening the supremacy of the empire or of\r\nthe central local power, it admits of considerable diversities being\r\nmade in the details of provincial government, where local peculiarities\r\nand antecedents render it undesirable to make a more complete\r\nassimilation of the Governments of the various provinces.\r\n\r\nMaterials have now been collected which will enable the reader to judge\r\nof the expediency or inexpediency of the course taken by Mr. Gladstone's\r\nGovernment in dealing with Ireland. Three alternatives were open to\r\nthem--\r\n\r\n    1. To let matters alone.\r\n    2. To pass a Coercion Bill.\r\n    3. To change the government of Ireland, and at\r\n    the same time to pass a Land Bill.\r\n\r\nThe two last measures are combined under the head of one alternative, as\r\nit will be shown in the sequel that no effective Land Bill can be passed\r\nwithout granting Home Rule in Ireland.\r\n\r\nNow, the short answer to the first alternative is, that no party in the\r\nState--Conservative, Whig, Radical, Unionist, Home Ruler,\r\nParnellite--thought it possible to leave things alone. That something\r\nmust be done was universally admitted.\r\n\r\nThe second alternative has found favour with the present Government, and\r\ncertainly is a better example of the triumph of hope over experience,\r\nthan even the proverbial second marriage.\r\n\r\nEighty-six years have elapsed since the Union. During the first\r\nthirty-two years only eleven years, and during the last fifty-four years\r\nonly two years have been free from special repressive legislation; yet\r\nthe agitation for repeal of the Union, and general discontent, are more\r\nviolent in 1887 than in any one of the eighty-six previous years. In\r\nthe name of common-sense, is there any reason for supposing that the\r\nCoercion Bill of 1887 will have a better or more enduring effect than\r\nits numerous predecessors? The _primâ facie_ case is at all events in\r\nfavour of the contention that, when so many trials of a certain remedy\r\nhave failed, it would be better not to try the same remedy again, but to\r\nhave recourse to some other medicine. What, then, was the position of\r\nMr. Gladstone's Government at the close of the election of 1885? What\r\nwere the considerations presented to them as supreme supervisors and\r\nguardians of the British Empire? They found that vast colonial empire\r\ntranquil and loyal beyond previous expectation--the greater colonies\r\nsatisfied with their existing position; the lesser expecting that as\r\nthey grew up to manhood they would be treated as men, and emancipated\r\nfrom childish restraints. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man were\r\ncontented with their sturdy dependent independence, loyal to the\r\nbackbone. One member only stood aloof, sulky and dissatisfied, and\r\nthough in law integrally united with the dominant community, practically\r\nwas dissociated from it by forming within Parliament (the controlling\r\nbody of the whole) a separate section, of which the whole aim was to\r\nfetter the action of the entire supreme body in order to bring to an\r\nexternal severance the practical disunion which existed between that\r\nmember and Great Britain. This member--Ireland--as compared with other\r\nparts of the empire, was small and insignificant; measured against Great\r\nBritain, its population was five millions to thirty-one millions, and\r\nits estimated capital was only one twenty-fourth part of the capital of\r\nthe United Kingdom. Measured against Australia, its trade with Great\r\nBritain was almost insignificant. Its importance arose from the force of\r\npublic opinion in Great Britain, which deemed England pledged to protect\r\nthe party in Ireland which desired the Union to be maintained, and from\r\nthe power of obstructing English legislation through the medium of the\r\nIrish contingent, willing and ready on every occasion to intervene in\r\nEnglish debates. The first step to be taken obviously was to find out\r\nwhat the great majority of Irish members wanted. The answer was, that\r\nthey would be contented to quit the British Parliament on having a\r\nParliament established on College Green, with full powers of local\r\ngovernment, and that they would accept on behalf of their country a\r\ncertain fixed annual sum to be paid to the Imperial Exchequer, on\r\ncondition that such sum should not be increased without the consent of\r\nthe Irish representatives. Here there were two great points gained\r\nwithout any sacrifice of principle. Ireland could not be said to be\r\ntaxed without representation when her representatives agreed to a\r\ncertain fixed sum to be paid till altered with their consent; while at\r\nthe same time all risk of obstruction to English legislation by Irish\r\nmeans was removed by the proposal that the Irish representatives should\r\nexercise local powers in Dublin instead of imperial powers at\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the above arrangement the Bill of Mr. Gladstone was\r\nfounded. Absolute local autonomy was conferred on Ireland; the assent of\r\nthe Irish members to quit the Imperial Parliament was accepted; and the\r\nBill provided that after a certain day the representative Irish peers\r\nshould cease to sit in the House of Lords, and the Irish members vacate\r\ntheir places in the House of Commons. Provisions were then made for the\r\nabsorption in the Irish Legislative Body of both the Irish\r\nrepresentative peers and Irish members.\r\n\r\nThe legislative supremacy of the British Parliament was maintained by an\r\nexpress provision excepting from any interference on the part of Irish\r\nLegislature all imperial powers, and declaring any enactment void which\r\ninfringed that provision; further, an enactment was inserted for the\r\npurpose of securing to the English Legislature in the last resource the\r\nabsolute power to make any law for the government of Ireland, and\r\ntherefore to repeal, or suspend, the Irish Constitution.\r\n\r\nTechnically these reservations of supremacy to the English Legislature\r\nwere unnecessary, as it is an axiom of constitutional law that a\r\nsovereign Legislature, such as the Queen and two Houses of Parliament in\r\nEngland, cannot bind their successors, and consequently can repeal or\r\nalter any law, however fundamental, and annul any restrictions on\r\nalteration, however strongly expressed. Practically they were never\r\nlikely to be called into operation, as it is the custom of Parliament to\r\nadhere, under all but the most extraordinary and unforeseen\r\ncircumstances, to any compact made by Act of Parliament between itself\r\nand any subordinate legislative body. The Irish Legislature was\r\nsubjected to the same controlling power which has for centuries been\r\napplied to prevent any excess of jurisdiction in our Colonial\r\nLegislatures, by a direction that an appeal as to the constitutionality\r\nof any laws which they might pass should lie to the Judicial Committee\r\nof the Privy Council. This supremacy of the imperial judicial power over\r\nthe action of the Colonial Legislatures was a system which the founders\r\nof the American Constitution copied in the establishment of their\r\nsupreme Court, and thereby secured for that legislative system a\r\nstability which has defied the assaults of faction and the strain of\r\ncivil war.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Government of Ireland was continued in her Majesty, and\r\nwas to be carried on by the Lord Lieutenant on her behalf, by the aid of\r\nsuch officers and such Council as her Majesty might from time to time\r\nsee fit. The initiative power of recommending taxation was also vested\r\nin the Queen, and delegated to the Lord Lieutenant. These clauses are\r\nco-ordinate and correlative with the clause conferring complete local\r\npowers on the Irish Legislature, while it preserves all imperial powers\r\nto the Imperial Legislature. The Governor is an imperial officer, and\r\nwill be bound to watch over imperial interests with a jealous scrutiny,\r\nand to veto any Bill which may be injurious to those interests. On the\r\nother hand, as respects all local matters, he will act on and be guided\r\nby the advice of the Irish Executive Council. The system is self-acting.\r\nThe Governor, for local purposes, must have a Council which is in\r\nharmony with the Legislative Body. If the Governor and a Council,\r\nsupported by the Legislative Body, do not agree, the Governor must give\r\nway, unless he can, by dismissing his Council, and dissolving the\r\nLegislative Body, obtain both a Council and a Legislative Body which\r\nwill support his views. As respects imperial questions, the case is\r\ndifferent; here the last word rests with the mother country, and in the\r\nlast resort a determination of the Executive Council, backed by the\r\nLegislative Body, to resist imperial rights, must be deemed an act of\r\nrebellion on the part of the Irish people, and be dealt with\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nIn acceding to the claims of the National Party for Home Rule in Ireland\r\nanother question had to be considered: the demands of the English\r\ngarrison, as it is called--or, in plain words, of the class of Irish\r\nlandlords--for protection. They urged that to grant Home Rule in Ireland\r\nwould be to hand them over to their enemies, their tenants, and to lead\r\nto an immediate, or to all events a proximate, confiscation of their\r\nproperties. Without admitting the truth of these apprehensions to the\r\nfull extent, or indeed to any great extent, it was undoubtedly felt by\r\nthe framers of the Home Rule Bill that a moral obligation rested on the\r\nImperial Government to remove, if possible, \"the fearful exasperations\r\nattending the agrarian relations in Ireland,\" rather than leave a\r\nquestion so fraught with danger, so involved in difficulty, to be\r\ndetermined by the Irish Government on its first entry on official\r\nexistence. Hence the Land Bill, the scheme of which was to frame a\r\nsystem under which the tenants, by being made owners of the soil, should\r\nbecome interested as a class in the maintenance of social order, while\r\nthe landlords should be enabled to rid themselves on fair terms of their\r\nestates, in cases where, from apprehension of impending changes, or for\r\npecuniary reasons, they were desirous of relieving themselves from the\r\nresponsibilities of ownership. Of the land scheme brought into\r\nParliament in 1886, it need only here be said that it proposed to lend\r\nthe Irish Government 3 per cent. stock at 3-1/8 per cent. interest, the\r\nIrish Government undertaking to purchase, from any Irish landlord\r\ndesirous of selling, his estate at (as a general rule) twenty years'\r\npurchase on the net rental. The money thus disbursed by the Irish\r\nGovernment was repaid to them by an annuity, payable by the tenant for\r\nforty-nine years, of 4 per cent. on a capital sum equal to twenty times\r\nthe gross rental; the result being that, were the Bill passed into law,\r\nthe tenant would become immediate owner of the land, subject to the\r\npayment of an annuity considerably less than the previous rent--that the\r\nIrish Government would make a considerable profit on the transaction,\r\ninasmuch as it would receive from the tenant interest calculated on the\r\nbasis of the _gross_ rental, whilst it would pay to the English\r\nGovernment interest calculated on the basis of the _net_ rental--and\r\nthat the English Government would sustain no loss if the interest were\r\nduly received by them.\r\n\r\nThe effect of such a plan appears almost magical: Ireland is transformed\r\nat one stroke from a nation of landlords into a nation of peasant\r\nproprietors--apparently without loss to any one, and with gain to\r\neverybody concerned, except the British Government, who neither gain nor\r\nlose in the matter. The practicability, however, of such a scheme\r\ndepends altogether on the security against loss afforded to the British\r\ntax-payer, for he is industrious and heavily burdened, and cannot be\r\nexpected to assent to any plan which will land him in any appreciable\r\nloss. Here it is that the plan of Mr. Gladstone's Land Bill differs from\r\nall other previous plans. Act after Act has been passed enabling the\r\ntenant to borrow money from the British Government on the security of\r\nthe holding, for the purpose of enabling him to purchase the fee-simple.\r\nIn such transactions the British Government becomes the mortgagee, and\r\ncan only recover its money, if default is made in payment, by ejecting\r\nthe tenant and becoming the landlord. In proportion, then, as any\r\nexisting purchase Act succeeds, in the same proportion the risk of the\r\nBritish taxpayer increases. He is ever placed in the most invidious of\r\nall lights; instead of posing as the generous benefactor who holds forth\r\nhis hand to rescue the landlord and tenant from an intolerable position,\r\nhe stands forward either as the grasping mortgagee or as the still more\r\nhated landlord, who, having deprived the tenant of his holding, is\r\nseeking to introduce another man into property which really belongs to\r\nthe ejected tenant. Such a position may be endurable when the number of\r\npurchasing tenants is small, but at once breaks down if agrarian reform\r\nin Ireland is to be extended so far as to make any appreciable\r\ndifference in the relations of landlord and tenant; still more, if it\r\nbecome general. Now, what is the remedy of such a state of things?\r\nSurely to interpose the Irish Government between the Irish debtor and\r\nhis English creditor, and to provide that the Irish revenues in bulk,\r\nnot the individual holdings of each tenant, shall be the security for\r\nthe English creditor. This was the scheme embodied in the Land Act of\r\n1886. The punctual payment of all money due from the Government of\r\nIreland to the Government of Great Britain was to have been secured by\r\nthe continuance in the hands of the British Government of the Excise and\r\nCustoms duties, and by the appointment of an Imperial Receiver-General,\r\nassisted by subordinate officers, and protected by an Imperial Court.\r\nThis officer would have received not only all the imperial taxes, but\r\nalso the local taxes; and it would have been his duty to satisfy the\r\nclaims of the British Government before he allowed any sum to pass into\r\nthe Irish Exchequer. In effect, the British Government, in relation to\r\nthe levying of imperial taxes, would have stood in the same relation to\r\nIreland as Congress does to the United States in respect to the levying\r\nof federal taxes. The fiscal unity of Great Britain and Ireland would\r\nhave been in this way secured, and the British Government protected\r\nagainst any loss of interest for the large sums to be expended in\r\ncarrying into effect in Ireland any agrarian reform worthy of the name.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Bills of 1886, as above represented, had at least three\r\nrecommendations:\r\n\r\n1. They created a state of things in Ireland under which it was possible\r\nto make a complete agrarian reform without exposing the English\r\nExchequer to any appreciable risk.\r\n\r\n2. They enabled the Irish to govern themselves as respects local\r\nmatters, while preserving intact the supremacy of the British Parliament\r\nand the integrity of the Empire.\r\n\r\n3. They enabled the British Parliament to govern the British Empire\r\nwithout any obstructive Irish interference.\r\n\r\nTo the first of these propositions no attempt at an answer has been\r\nmade. The Land Bill was never considered on its merits; indeed, was\r\nnever practically discussed, but was at once swept into oblivion by the\r\nwave which overwhelmed the Home Rule Bill.\r\n\r\nThe contention against the second proposition was concerned in proving\r\nthat the supremacy of the British Parliament was not maintained: the\r\npractical answer to this objection has been given above. Pushed to its\r\nutmost, it could only amount to proof that an amendment ought to have\r\nbeen introduced in Committee, declaring, in words better selected than\r\nthose introduced for that purpose in the Bill, that nothing in the Act\r\nshould affect the supremacy of the British Parliament. In short, the\r\nwhole discussion here necessarily resolved itself into a mere verbal\r\nsquabble as to the construction of a clause in a Bill not yet in\r\nCommittee, and had no bottom or substance.\r\n\r\nIt was also urged that the concession of self-government to Ireland was\r\nbut another mode of handing over the Loyalist party--or, as it is\r\nsometimes called, the English garrison--to the tender mercies of the\r\nParnellites. The reply to this would seem to be, that as respects\r\nproperty the Land Bill effectually prevented any interference of the\r\nIrish Parliament with the land; nay, more, enabled any Irishman desirous\r\nof turning his land into money to do so on the most advantageous terms\r\nthat ever had been--and with a falling market it may be confidently\r\nprophesied ever can be--offered to the Irish landlord; while as respect\r\nlife and liberty, were it possible that they should be endangered, it\r\nwas the duty of the imperial officer, the Lord Lieutenant, to take means\r\nfor the preservation of peace and good order; and behind him, to enforce\r\nhis behests, stand the strong battalions who, to our sorrow be it\r\nspoken, have so often been called upon to put down disturbance and\r\nanarchy in Ireland.\r\n\r\nCompeting plans have been put forward, with more or less detail, for\r\ngoverning Ireland. The suggestion that Ireland should be governed as a\r\n_Crown_ colony need only be mentioned to be rejected. It means in\r\neffect, that Ireland should sink from the rank of an equal or\r\nindependent member of the British Empire to the grade of the most\r\ndependent of her colonies, and should be governed despotically by\r\nEnglish officials, without representation in the English Parliament or\r\nany machinery of local self-government. Another proposal has been to\r\ngive four provincial Governments to Ireland, limiting their powers to\r\nlocal rating, education, and legislation in respect of matters which\r\nform the subjects of private Bill legislation at present; in fact, to\r\nplace them somewhat on the footing of the provinces of Canada, while\r\nreserving to the English Parliament the powers vested in the Dominion of\r\nCanada. Such a scheme would seem adapted to whet the appetite of the\r\nIrish for nationality, without supplying them with any portion of the\r\nreal article. It would supply no basis on which a system of agrarian\r\nreform could be founded, as it would be impossible to leave the\r\ndetermination of a local question, which is a unit in its dangers and\r\nits difficulties, to four different Legislatures; above all, the hinge\r\non which the question turns--the sufficiency of the security for the\r\nBritish taxpayer--could not be afforded by provincial resources. Indeed,\r\nno alternative for the Land Bill of 1886 has been suggested which does\r\nnot err in one of the following points: either it pledges English credit\r\non insufficient security, or it requires the landowners to accept Irish\r\ndebentures or some form of Irish paper money at par; in other words, it\r\nmakes English taxes a fund for relieving Irish landlords, or else it\r\ncompels the Irish landowner, if he sells at all, to sell at an\r\ninadequate price. Before parting with Canada, it may be worth while\r\nnoticing that another, and more feasible, alternative is to imitate more\r\nclosely the Canadian Constitution, and to vest the central or Dominion\r\npowers in a central Legislature in Dublin, parcelling out the provincial\r\npowers, as they have been called, amongst several provincial\r\nLegislatures. This scheme might be made available as a means of\r\nprotecting Ulster from the supposed danger of undue interference from\r\nthe Central Government, and for making, possibly, other diversities in\r\nthe local administration of various parts of Ireland in order to meet\r\nspecial local exigencies.\r\n\r\nA leading writer among the dissentient Liberals has intimated that one\r\nof two forms of representative colonial government might be imposed on\r\nIreland--either the form in which the executive is conducted by\r\ncolonial officials, or the form of the great irresponsible colonies. The\r\nfirst of these forms is open to the objection, that it perpetuates those\r\nstruggles between English executive measures and Irish opinion which has\r\nmade Ireland for centuries ungovernable, and led to the establishment of\r\nthe union and destruction of Irish independence in 1800; the second\r\nproposal would destroy the fiscal unity of the empire--leave the\r\nagrarian feud unextinguished, and aggravate the objections which have\r\nbeen urged against the Home Rule Bill of 1886. A question still remains,\r\nin relation to the _form_ of the Home Rule Bill of 1886, which would not\r\nhave deserved attention but for the prominence given to it in some of\r\nthe discussions upon the subject. The Bill of 1886 provides \"that the\r\nLegislature may make laws for the peace, order, and good government of\r\nIreland,\" but subjects their power to numerous exceptions and\r\nrestrictions. The Act establishing the Dominion of Canada enumerates\r\nvarious matters in respect of which the Legislature of Canada is to have\r\nexclusive power, but prefaces the enumeration with a clause \"that the\r\nDominion Legislature may make laws for the peace, order, and good\r\ngovernment of Canada in relation to all matters not within the\r\njurisdiction of the provincial Legislatures, although such matters may\r\nnot be specially mentioned.\" In effect, therefore, the difference\r\nbetween the Irish Bill and the Canadian Act is one of expression and not\r\nof substance, and, although the Bill is more accurate in its form, it\r\nwould scarcely be worth while to insist on legislating by exception\r\ninstead of by enumeration if, by the substitution of the latter form for\r\nthe former, any material opposition would be conciliated.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the conclusions intended to be drawn from the foregoing\r\npremises?\r\n\r\n1. That coercion is played out, and can no longer be regarded as a\r\nremedy for the evils of Irish misrule.\r\n\r\n2. That some alternative must be found, and that the only alternative\r\nwithin the range of practical politics is some form of Home Rule.\r\n\r\n3. That there is no reason for thinking that the grant of Home Rule to\r\nIreland--a member only, and not one of the most important members, of\r\nthe British Empire--will in any way dismember, or even in the slightest\r\ndegree risk the dismemberment of the Empire.\r\n\r\n4. That Home Rule presupposes and admits the supremacy of the British\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n5. That theory is in favour of Home Rule, as the nationality of Ireland\r\nis distinct, and justifies a desire for local independence; while the\r\nestablishment of Home Rule is a necessary condition to the effectual\r\nremoval of agrarian disturbances in Ireland.\r\n\r\n6. That precedent is in favour of granting Home Rule to Ireland--_e.g._\r\nthe success of the new Constitution in Austria-Hungary, and the happy\r\neffects resulting from the establishment of the Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\n7.

Apart from its dramatic interest, apart from its influence on\r\nthe fortune of parties, and its effect on the imperial position of Great\r\nBritain, it involves so many large principles of statesmanship, and\r\nraises so many delicate points of constitutional law, as to deserve the\r\nstudy of philosophical thinkers no less than of practical politicians in\r\nevery free country.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which led to the introduction of the Government of\r\nIreland Bill, in April, 1886, are familiar to Americans as well as\r\nEnglishmen. Ever since the crowns and parliaments of Great Britain and\r\nIreland were united, in A.D. 1800, there has been in Ireland a party\r\nwhich protested against that union as fraudulently obtained and\r\ninexpedient in itself. For many years this party, led by Daniel\r\nO'Connell, maintained an agitation for Repeal. After his death a more\r\nextreme section, which sought the complete independence of Ireland,\r\nraised the insurrection of 1848, and subsequently, under the guidance of\r\nother hands, formed the Fenian conspiracy, whose projected insurrection\r\nwas nipped in the bud in 1867, though the conspiracy continued to menace\r\nthe Government and the tranquillity of the island. In 1872 the Home Rule\r\nparty was formed, demanding, not the Repeal of the Union, but the\r\ncreation of an Irish Legislature, and the agitation, conducted in\r\nParliament in a more systematic and persistent way than heretofore, took\r\nalso a legitimate constitutional form. To this demand English and Scotch\r\nopinion was at first almost unanimously opposed. At the General Election\r\nof 1880, which, however, turned mainly on the foreign policy of Lord\r\nBeaconsfield's Government, not more than three or four members were\r\nreturned by constituencies in Great Britain who professed to consider\r\nHome Rule as even an open question. All through the Parliament, which\r\nsat from 1880 till 1885, the Nationalist party, led by Mr. Parnell, and\r\nincluding at first less than half, ultimately about half, of the Irish\r\nmembers, was in constant and generally bitter opposition to the\r\nGovernment of Mr. Gladstone. But during these five years a steady,\r\nalthough silent and often unconscious, process of change was passing in\r\nthe minds of English and Scotch members, especially Liberal members, due\r\nto their growing sense of the mistakes which Parliament committed in\r\nhandling Irish questions, and of the hopelessness of the efforts which\r\nthe Executive was making to pacify the country on the old methods. The\r\nadoption of a Home Rule policy by one of the great English parties was,\r\ntherefore, not so sudden a change as it seemed. The process had been\r\ngoing on for years, though in its earlier stages it was so gradual and\r\nso unwelcome as to be faintly felt and reluctantly admitted by the minds\r\nthat were undergoing it. In the spring of 1886 the question could be no\r\nlonger evaded or postponed. It was necessary to choose between one of\r\ntwo courses; the refusal of the demand for self-government, coupled with\r\nthe introduction of a severe Coercion Bill, or the concession of it by\r\nthe introduction of a Home Rule Bill. There were some few who suggested,\r\nas a third course, the granting of a limited measure of local\r\ninstitutions, such as county boards; but most people felt, as did Mr.\r\nGladstone's Ministry, that this plan would have had most of the dangers\r\nand few of the advantages of either of the two others.\r\n\r\nHow the Government of Ireland Bill was brought into the House of Commons\r\non April 8th, amid circumstances of curiosity and excitement\r\nunparalleled since 1832; how, after debates of almost unprecedented\r\nlength, it was defeated in June, by a majority of thirty; how the policy\r\nit embodied was brought before the country at the General Election, and\r\nfailed to win approval--all this is too well known to need\r\nrecapitulation here. But the causes of the disaster have not been well\r\nunderstood, for it is only now--now, when the smoke of the battle has\r\ncleared away from the field--that these causes have begun to stand\r\nrevealed in their true proportions.\r\n\r\nBesides some circumstances attending the production of the Bill, to\r\nwhich I shall refer presently, and which told heavily against it, there\r\nwere three feelings which worked upon men's minds, disposing them to\r\nreject it.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was dislike and fear of the Irish Nationalist\r\nmembers. In the previous House of Commons this party had been uniformly\r\nand bitterly hostile to the Liberal Government. Measures intended for\r\nthe good of Ireland, like the Land Act of 1881, had been ungraciously\r\nreceived, treated as concessions extorted, for which no thanks were\r\ndue--inadequate concessions, which must be made the starting-point for\r\nfresh demands. Obstruction had been freely practised to defeat not only\r\nbills restraining the liberty of the subject in Ireland, but many other\r\nmeasures. Some few members of the Irish party had systematically sought\r\nto delay all English and Scotch legislation, and, in fact, to bring the\r\nwork of Parliament to a dead stop. Much violent language had been used,\r\neven where the provocation was slight. The outbreaks of crime which had\r\nrepeatedly occurred in Ireland had been, not, indeed, defended, but so\r\noften passed over in silence by Nationalist speakers, that English\r\nopinion was inclined to hold them practically responsible for disorders\r\nwhich, so it was thought, they had neither wished nor tried to prevent.\r\n(I am, of course, expressing no opinion as to the justice of this view,\r\nnor as to the excuses to be made for the Parliamentary tactics of the\r\nIrish party, but merely stating how their conduct struck many\r\nEnglishmen.) There could be no doubt as to the hostility which they,\r\nstill less as to that which their fellow-countrymen in the United\r\nStates, had expressed toward England, for they had openly wished success\r\nto Russia while war seemed impending with her, and the so-called Mahdi\r\nof the Soudan was vociferously cheered at many a Nationalist meeting. At\r\nthe Election of 1885 they had done their utmost to defeat Liberal\r\ncandidates in every English and Scotch constituency where there existed\r\na body of Irish voters, and had thrown some twenty seats or more into\r\nthe hands of the Tories. Now, to many Englishmen, the proposal to create\r\nan Irish Parliament seemed nothing more or less than a proposal to hand\r\nover to these Irish members the government of Ireland, with all the\r\nopportunities thence arising to oppress the opposite party in Ireland\r\nand to worry England herself. It was all very well to urge that the\r\ntactics which the Nationalists had pursued when their object was to\r\nextort Home Rule would be dropped, because superfluous, when Home Rule\r\nhad been granted; or to point out that an Irish Parliament would contain\r\ndifferent men from those who had been sent to Westminster as Mr.\r\nParnell's nominees. Neither of these arguments could overcome the\r\nsuspicious antipathy which many Englishmen felt, nor dissolve the\r\nassociation in their minds between the Nationalist leaders and the\r\nforces of disorder. The Parnellites (thus they reasoned) are bad men;\r\nwhat they seek is therefore likely to be bad, and whether bad in itself\r\nor not, they will make a bad use of it. In such reasonings there was\r\nmore of sentiment and prejudice than of reason, but sentiment and\r\nprejudice are proverbially harder than arguments to expel from minds\r\nwhere they have made a lodgment.\r\n\r\nThe internal condition of Ireland supplied more substantial grounds for\r\nalarm. As everybody knows, she is not, either in religion or in blood,\r\nor in feelings and ideas, a homogeneous country. Three-fourths of the\r\npeople are Roman Catholics, one-fourth Protestants, and this Protestant\r\nfourth subdivided into bodies not fond of one another, who have little\r\ncommunity of sentiment. Besides the Scottish colony in Ulster, many\r\nEnglish families have settled here and there through the country. They\r\nhave been regarded as intruders by the aboriginal Celtic population, and\r\nmany of them, although hundreds of years may have passed since they\r\ncame, still look on themselves as rather English than Irish. The last\r\nfifty years, whose wonderful changes have in most parts of the world\r\ntended to unite and weld into one compact body the inhabitants of each\r\npart of the earth's surface, connecting them by the ties of commerce,\r\nand of a far easier and swifter intercourse than was formerly possible,\r\nhave in Ireland worked in the opposite direction. It has become more and\r\nmore the habit of the richer class in Ireland to go to England for its\r\nenjoyment, and to feel itself socially rather English than Irish. Thus\r\nthe chasm between the immigrants and the aborigines has grown deeper.\r\nThe upper class has not that Irish patriotism which it showed in the\r\ndays of the National Irish Parliament (1782-1800), and while there is\r\nthus less of a common national feeling to draw rich and poor together,\r\nthe strife of landlords and tenants has continued, irritating the minds\r\nof both parties, and gathering them into two hostile camps. As everybody\r\nknows, the Nationalist agitation has been intimately associated with the\r\nLand agitation--has, in fact, found a strong motive-force in the desire\r\nof the tenants to have their rents reduced, and themselves secured\r\nagainst eviction. Now, many people in England assumed that an Irish\r\nParliament would be under the control of the tenants and the humbler\r\nclass generally, and would therefore be hostile to the landlords. They\r\nwent farther, and made the much bolder assumption that as such a\r\nParliament would be chosen by electors, most of whom were Roman\r\nCatholics, it would be under the control of the Catholic priesthood, and\r\nhostile to Protestants. Thus they supposed that the grant of\r\nself-government to Ireland would mean the abandonment of the upper and\r\nwealthier class, the landlords and the Protestants, to the tender\r\nmercies of their enemies. Such abandonment, it was proclaimed on a\r\nthousand platforms, would be disgraceful in itself, dishonouring to\r\nEngland, a betrayal of the very men who had stood by her in the past,\r\nand were prepared to stand by her in the future, if only she would stand\r\nby them. It was, of course, replied by the defenders of the Home Rule\r\nBill, that what the so-called English party in Ireland really stood by\r\nwas their own ascendency over the Irish masses--an oppressive\r\nascendency, which had caused most of the disorders of the country. As to\r\nreligion, there were many Protestants besides Mr. Parnell himself among\r\nthe Nationalist leaders. There was no ill-feeling (except in Ulster)\r\nbetween Protestants and Roman Catholics in Ireland. There was no reason\r\nto expect that either the Catholic hierarchy or the priesthood generally\r\nwould be supreme in an Irish Parliament, and much reason to expect the\r\ncontrary. As regards Ulster, where, no doubt, there were special\r\ndifficulties, due to the bitter antagonism of the Orangemen (not of the\r\nProtestants generally) and Catholics, Mr. Gladstone had undertaken to\r\nconsider any special provisions which could be suggested as proper to\r\nmeet those difficulties. These replies, however, made little impression.\r\nThey were pronounced, and pronounced all the more confidently the more\r\nignorant of Ireland the speaker was, to be too hypothetical. To many\r\nEnglishmen the case seemed to be one of two hostile factions contending\r\nin Ireland for the last sixty years, and that the gift of\r\nself-government might enable one of them to tyrannize over the other.\r\nTrue, that party was the majority, and, according to the principles of\r\ndemocratic government, therefore entitled to prevail. But it is one\r\nthing to admit a principle and another to consent to its application.\r\nThe minority had the sympathy of the upper classes in England, because\r\nthe minority contained the landlords. It had the sympathy of a part of\r\nthe middle class, because it contained the Protestants. And of those\r\nEnglishmen who were impartial as between the Irish factions, there were\r\nsome who held that England must in any case remain responsible for the\r\ninternal peace and the just government of Ireland, and could not grant\r\npowers whose possession might tempt the one party to injustice, and the\r\nother to resist injustice by violence.\r\n\r\nThere was another anticipation, another forecast of evils to follow,\r\nwhich told most of all upon English opinion. This was the notion that\r\nHome Rule was only a stage in the road to the complete separation of the\r\ntwo islands. The argument was conceived as follows: \"The motive passions\r\nof the Irish agitation have all along been hatred toward England and a\r\ndesire to make Ireland a nation, holding her independent place among the\r\nnations of the world. This design was proclaimed by the Young Irelanders\r\nof 1848 and by the Fenian rebels of 1866; it has been avowed, in\r\nintervals of candour, by the present Nationalists themselves. The grant\r\nof an Irish Parliament will stimulate rather than appease this thirst\r\nfor separate national existence. The nearer complete independence seems,\r\nthe more will it be desired. Hatred to England will still be an active\r\nforce, because the amount of control which England retains will irritate\r\nIrish pride, as well as limit Irish action; while all the misfortunes\r\nwhich may befall the new Irish Government will be blamed, not on its own\r\nimprudence, but on the English connection. And as the motives for\r\nseeking separation will remain, so the prospect of obtaining it will\r\nseem better. Agitation will have a better vantage-ground in an Irish\r\nParliament than it formerly had among the Irish members of a British\r\nLegislature; and if actual resistance to the Queen's authority should be\r\nattempted, it will be attempted under conditions more favourable than\r\nthe present, because the rebels will have in their hands the machinery\r\nof Irish Government, large financial resources, and a _prima facie_\r\ntitle to represent the will of the Irish people. As against a rebellious\r\nparty in Ireland, England has now two advantages--an advantage of\r\ntheory, an advantage of fact. The advantage of theory is that she does\r\nnot admit Ireland to be a distinct nation, but maintains that in the\r\nUnited Kingdom there is but one nation, whereof some inhabit Great\r\nBritain and some Ireland. The advantage of fact is that, through her\r\ncontrol of the constabulary, the magistrates, the courts of justice,\r\nand, in fine, the whole administrative system of Ireland, she can easily\r\nquell insurrectionary movements. By creating an Irish Parliament and\r\nGovernment she would strip herself of both these advantages.\"\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that I do not admit the fairness of this statement of\r\nthe case, because some of the premises are untrue, and because it\r\nmisrepresents the nature of the Irish Government which Mr. Gladstone's\r\nBill would have created. But I am trying to state the case as it was\r\nsedulously and skilfully presented to Englishmen. And it told all the\r\nmore upon English waverers, because the considerations above mentioned\r\nseemed, if well founded, to destroy and cut away the chief ground on\r\nwhich Home Rule had been advocated, viz. that it would relieve England\r\nfrom the constant pressure of Irish discontent and agitation, and bring\r\nabout a time of tranquillity, permitting good feeling to grow up between\r\nthe peoples. If Home Rule was, after all, to be nothing more than a\r\nhalf-way house to independence, an Irish Parliament only a means of\r\nextorting a more complete emancipation from imperial control, was it not\r\nmuch better to keep things as they were, and go on enduring evils, the\r\nworst of which were known already? Hence the advocates of the Bill\r\ndenied not the weight of the argument, but its applicability.\r\nSeparation, they urged, is impossible, for it is contrary to the nature\r\nof things, which indicates that the two islands must go together. It is\r\nnot desired by the Irish people, for it would injure them far more than\r\nit could possibly injure England, since Ireland finds in England the\r\nonly market for her produce, the only source whence capital flows to\r\nher. A small revolutionary party has, no doubt, conspired to obtain it.\r\nBut the only sympathy they received was due to the fact that the\r\nlegitimate demand of Ireland for a recognition of her national feeling\r\nand for the management of her own local affairs was contemptuously\r\nignored by England. The concession of that demand will banish the notion\r\neven from those minds which now entertain it, whereas its continued\r\nrefusal may perpetuate that alienation of feeling which is at the bottom\r\nof all the mischief, the one force that makes for separation.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of my present purpose to examine these arguments and\r\ncounter arguments, but only to show what were the grounds on which a\r\nmajority of the English voters refused to pronounce in favour of the\r\nHome Rule Bill. The reader will have observed that the issues raised\r\nwere not only numerous, but full of difficulty. They were issues of\r\nfact, involving a knowledge both of the past history of Ireland and of\r\nher present state. They were also issues of inference, for even\r\nsupposing the broad facts to be ascertained, these facts were\r\nsusceptible of different interpretations, and men might, and did,\r\nhonestly draw opposite conclusions from them. A more obscure and\r\ncomplicated problem, or rather group of problems, has seldom been\r\npresented to a nation for its decision. But the nation did not possess\r\nthe requisite knowledge. Closely connected as Ireland seems to be with\r\nEngland, long as the Irish question has been a main trouble in English\r\npolitics, the English and Scottish people know amazingly little about\r\nIreland. Even in the upper class, you meet with comparatively few\r\npersons who have set foot on Irish soil, and, of course, far fewer who\r\nhave ever examined the condition of the island and the sources of her\r\ndiscontent. Irish history, which is, no doubt, dismal reading, is a\r\nblank page to the English. In January, 1886, one found scarce any\r\npoliticians who had ever heard of the Irish Parliament of 1782. And in\r\nthat year, 1886, an Englishman anxious to discover the real state of the\r\ncountry did not know where to go for information. What appeared in the\r\nEnglish newspapers, or, rather, in the one English newspaper which keeps\r\na standing \"own correspondent\" in Dublin, was (as it still is) a grossly\r\nand almost avowedly partisan report, in which opinions are skilfully\r\nmixed with so-called facts, selected, consciously or unconsciously, to\r\nsupport the writer's view. The Nationalist press is, of course, not less\r\nstrongly partisan on its own side, so that not merely an average\r\nEnglishman, but even the editor of an English newspaper, who desires to\r\nascertain the true state of matters and place it before his English\r\nreaders, has had, until within the last few months, when events in\r\nIreland began to be fully reported in Great Britain, no better means at\r\nhis disposal for understanding Ireland than for understanding Bulgaria.\r\nI do not dwell upon this ignorance as an argument for Home Rule, though,\r\nof course, it is often so used. I merely wish to explain the\r\nbewilderment in which Englishmen found themselves when required to\r\nsettle by their votes a question of immense difficulty. Many, on both\r\nsides, simply followed their party banners. Tories voted for Lord\r\nSalisbury; thorough-going admirers of Mr. Gladstone voted for Mr.\r\nGladstone. But there was on the Liberal side a great mass who were\r\nutterly perplexed by the position. Contradictory statements of fact, as\r\nwell as contradictory arguments, were flung at their heads in\r\ndistracting profusion. They felt themselves unable to determine what was\r\ntrue and who was right. But one thing seemed clear to them. The policy\r\nof Home Rule was a new policy. They had been accustomed to censure and\r\noppose it. Only nine months before, the Irish Nationalists had\r\nemphasized their hostility to the Liberal party by doing their utmost to\r\ndefeat Liberal candidates in English constituencies. Hence, when it was\r\nproclaimed that Home Rule was the true remedy which the Liberal party\r\nmust accept, they were startled and discomposed.\r\n\r\nNow, the English are not a nimble-minded people. They cannot, to use a\r\nfamiliar metaphor, turn round in their own length. Their momentum is\r\nsuch as to carry them on for some distance in the direction wherein they\r\nhave been moving, even after the order to stop has been given. They need\r\ntime to appreciate, digest, and comprehend a new proposition. Timid they\r\nare not, nor, perhaps, exceptionally cautious, but they do not like to\r\nbe hurried, and insist on looking at a proposition for a good while\r\nbefore they come to a decision regarding it. It is one of the qualities\r\nwhich make them a great people. As has been observed, this proposition\r\nwas novel, was most serious, and raised questions which they felt that\r\ntheir knowledge was insufficient to determine. Accordingly, a certain\r\nsection of the Liberal party refused to accept it. A great number,\r\nprobably the majority, of these doubtful men abstained from voting.\r\nOthers voted against the Home Rule Liberal candidates, not necessarily\r\nbecause they condemned the policy, but because, as they were not\r\nsatisfied that it was right, they deemed delay a less evil than the\r\ncommittal of the nation to a new departure, which might prove\r\nirrevocable.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that it was only hesitation which\r\ndrove many Liberals into the host arrayed against the Irish Government\r\nBill. I have already said that among the leaders there were some, and\r\nthose men of great influence, who condemned its principles. This was\r\ntrue also of a considerable, though a relatively smaller, section of the\r\nrank and file. And it was only what might have been expected. The\r\nproposal to undo much of the work done in 1800, to alter fundamentally\r\nthe system which had for eighty-six years regulated the relations of the\r\ntwo islands, by setting up a Parliament in Ireland, was a proposal which\r\nnot only had not formed a part of the accepted creed of the Liberal\r\nparty, but fell outside party lines altogether. It might, no doubt, be\r\nargued, as was actually done, and as those who understand the history of\r\nthe Liberal party have more and more come to see, that Liberal\r\nprinciples recommended it, since they involve faith in the people, and\r\nfaith in the curative tendency of local self-government. But this was by\r\nno means axiomatic. Taking the whole complicated facts of the case, and\r\ntaking Liberalism as it had been practically understood in England, a\r\nman might in July, 1886, deem himself a good Liberal and yet think that\r\nthe true interests of both peoples would be best served by maintaining\r\nthe existing Parliamentary system. Similarly, there was nothing in\r\nToryism or Tory principles to prevent a fair-minded and patriotic Tory\r\nfrom approving the Home Rule scheme. It was a return to the older\r\ninstitutions of the monarchy, and not inconsistent with any of the\r\ndoctrines which the Tory party had been accustomed to uphold. The\r\nquestion, in short, was one of those which cut across ordinary party\r\nlines, creating new divisions among politicians; and there might have\r\nbeen and ought to have been Liberal Home Rulers and Tory Home Rulers,\r\nLiberal opponents of Home Rule and Tory opponents of Home Rule.\r\n\r\nBut here comes in a feature, a natural but none the less a regrettable\r\nfeature, of the English party system. As the object of the party in\r\nopposition is to turn out the party in power and seat itself in their\r\nplace, every Opposition regards with the strongest prejudice the\r\nmeasures proposed by a ruling Ministry. Cases sometimes occur where\r\nthese measures are so obviously necessary, or so evidently approved by\r\nthe nation, that the Opposition accepts them. But in general it scans\r\nthem with a hostile eye. Human nature is human nature; and when the\r\ndefeat of Government can be secured by defeating a Government Bill, the\r\ntemptation to the Opposition to secure it is irresistible. Now, the Tory\r\nparty is far more cohesive than the Liberal party, far more obedient to\r\nits leaders, far less disposed to break into sections, each of which\r\nthinks and acts for itself. Accordingly, that division of opinion in the\r\nTory party which might have been expected, and which would have occurred\r\nif those who composed the Tory party had been merely so many reflecting\r\nmen, and not members of a closely compacted political organization, did\r\nnot occur. Liberals were divided, as such a question would naturally\r\ndivide them. Tories were not divided; they threw their whole strength\r\nagainst the Bill. I am far from suggesting that they did so against\r\ntheir consciences. Whatever may be said as to two or three of the\r\nleaders, whose previous language and conduct seemed to indicate that\r\nthey would themselves, had the election of 1885 gone differently, have\r\nbeen inclined to a Home Rule policy, many of the Tory chiefs, as well\r\nas the great mass of the party, honestly disapproved Mr. Gladstone's\r\nmeasure. But their party motives and party affiliations gave it no\r\nchance of an impartial verdict at their hands. They went into the\r\njury-box with an invincible prepossession against the scheme of their\r\nopponents. When all these difficulties are duly considered, and\r\nespecially when regard is had to those which I have last enumerated, the\r\nsuddenness with which the new policy was launched, and the fact that as\r\ncoming from one party it was sure beforehand of the hostility of the\r\nother, no surprise can be felt at its fate. Those who, in England, now\r\nlook back over the spring and summer of 1886 are rather surprised that\r\nit should come so near succeeding. To have been rejected by a majority\r\nof only thirty in Parliament, and of little over ten per cent. of the\r\ntotal number of electors who voted at the general election, is a defeat\r\nfar less severe than any one who knew England would have predicted.\r\n\r\nThat the decision of the country is regarded by nobody as a final\r\ndecision goes without saying. It was not regarded as final, even in the\r\nfirst weeks after it was given. This was not because the majority was\r\ncomparatively small, for a smaller majority the other way would have\r\nbeen conclusive. It is because the country had not time enough for full\r\nconsideration and deliberate judgment. The Bill was brought in on April\r\n14th, the elections began on July 1st; no one can say what might have\r\nbeen the result of a long discussion, during which the first feelings of\r\nalarm (for alarm there was) might have worn off. And the decision is\r\nwithout finality, also, because the decision of the country was merely\r\nagainst the particular plan proposed by Mr. Gladstone, and not in favour\r\nof any alternative plan for dealing with Ireland, most certainly not for\r\nthe coercive method which has since been adopted. One particular\r\nsolution of the Irish problem was refused. The problem still stands\r\nconfronting us, and when other modes of solving it have been in turn\r\nrejected, the country may come back to this mode.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn from the past to the future. Yet the account which has\r\nbeen given of the feelings and ideas arrayed against the Bill does not\r\nwholly belong to the past. They are the feelings to which the opponents\r\nof any plan of self-government for Ireland still appeal, and which will\r\nhave to be removed or softened down before it can be accepted by the\r\nEnglish. In particular, the probability of separation, and the supposed\r\ndangers to the Protestants and the landlords from an Irish Parliament,\r\nwill continue to form the themes of controversy so long as the question\r\nremains unsettled.\r\n\r\nWhat are the prospects of its settlement? What is the position which it\r\nnow occupies? How has it affected the current politics of England?\r\n\r\nIt broke up the Liberal party in Parliament. The vast numerical majority\r\nof that party in the country supported, and still supports, Mr.\r\nGladstone and the policy of Irish self-government. But the dissentient\r\nminority includes many men of influence, and constitutes in the House of\r\nCommons a body of about seventy members, who hold the balance between\r\nparties. For the present they are leagued with the Tory Ministry to\r\nresist Home Rule, and their support insures a parliamentary majority to\r\nthat Ministry. But it is, of course, necessary for them to rally to Lord\r\nSalisbury, not only on Irish questions, but on all questions; for, under\r\nour English system, a Ministry defeated on any serious issue is bound to\r\nresign, or dissolve Parliament. Now, to maintain an alliance for a\r\nspecial purpose, between members of opposite parties, is a hard matter.\r\nAgreement about Ireland does not, of itself, help men to agree about\r\nforeign policy, or bimetallism, or free trade, or changes in land laws,\r\nor ecclesiastical affairs. When these and other grave questions come up\r\nin Parliament, the Tory Ministry and their Liberal allies must, on\r\nevery occasion, negotiate a species of concordat, whereby the liberty\r\nof both is fettered. One party may wish to resist innovation, the other\r\nto yield to it, or even to anticipate it. Each is obliged to forego\r\nsomething in order to humour the other; neither has the pleasure or the\r\ncredit of taking a bold line on its own responsibility. There is, no\r\ndoubt, less difference between the respective tenets of the great\r\nEnglish parties than there was twenty years ago, when Mr. Disraeli had\r\nnot yet completed the education of one party, and economic laws were\r\nstill revered by the other. But, besides its tenets, each party has its\r\ntendencies, its sympathies, its moral atmosphere; and these differ so\r\nwidely as to make the co-operation of Tories and Liberals constrained\r\nand cumbrous. Moreover, there are the men to be considered, the leaders\r\non each side, whose jealousies, rivalries, suspicions, personal\r\nincompatibilities, neither old habits of joint action nor corporate\r\nparty feeling exist to soften. On the whole, therefore, it is unlikely\r\nthat the league of these two parties, united for one question only, and\r\nthat a question which will pass into new phases, can be durable. Either\r\nthe league will dissolve, or the smaller party will be absorbed into the\r\nlarger. In England, as in America, third parties rarely last. The\r\nattraction of the larger mass is irresistible, and when the crisis which\r\ncreated a split or generated a new group has passed, or the opinion the\r\nnew group advocates has been either generally discredited or generally\r\nadopted, the small party melts away, its older members disappearing from\r\npublic life, its younger ones finding their career in the ranks of one\r\nof the two great standing armies of politics. If the dissentient, or\r\nanti-Home Rule, Liberal party lives till the next general election, it\r\ncannot live longer, for at that election it will be ground to powder\r\nbetween the upper and nether millstones of the regular Liberals and the\r\nregular Tories.\r\n\r\nThe Irish struggle of 1886 has had another momentous consequence. It\r\nhas brought the Nationalist or Parnellite party into friendly relations\r\nwith the mass of English Liberals. When the Home Rule party was founded\r\nby Mr. Butt, some fifteen years ago, it had more in common with the\r\nLiberal than with the Tory party. But as it demanded what both English\r\nparties were then resolved to refuse, it was forced into antagonism to\r\nboth; and from 1877 onward (Mr. Butt being then dead) the antagonism\r\nbecame bitter, and, of course, specially bitter as toward the statesmen\r\nin power, because it was they who continued to refuse what the\r\nNationalists sought. Mr. Parnell has always stated, with perfect\r\ncandour, that he and his friends must fight for their own hand\r\nunhampered by English alliances, and getting the most they could for\r\nIreland from the weakness of either English party. This position they\r\nstill retain. If the Tory party will give them Home Rule, they will help\r\nthe Tory party. However, as the Tory party has gained office by opposing\r\nHome Rule, this contingency may seem not to lie within the immediate\r\nfuture. On the other hand, the Gladstonian Liberals have lost office for\r\ntheir advocacy of Home Rule, and now stand pledged to maintain the\r\npolicy they have proclaimed. The Nationalists have, therefore, for the\r\nfirst time since the days immediately following the Union of A.D. 1800\r\n(a measure which the Whigs of those days resisted), a great English\r\nparty admitting the justice of their claim, and inviting them to agitate\r\nfor it by purely constitutional methods. For such an alliance the\r\nEnglish Liberals are hotly reproached, both by the Tories and by the\r\ndissentients who follow Lord Harrington and Mr. Chamberlain. They are\r\naccused of disloyalty to England. The past acts and words of the\r\nNationalists are thrown in their teeth, and they are told that in\r\nsupporting the Irish claim they condone such acts, they adopt such\r\nwords. They reply by denying the adoption, and by pointing out that the\r\nTories themselves were from 1881 till 1886 in a practical, and often\r\nvery close, though unavowed, Parliamentary alliance with the\r\nNationalists in the House of Commons. The student of history will,\r\nhowever, conceive that the Liberals have a stronger and higher defence\r\nthan any _tu quoque_. Issues that involve the welfare of peoples are far\r\ntoo serious for us to apply to them the same sentiments of personal\r\ntaste and predilection which we follow in inviting a dinner party, or\r\nselecting companions for a vacation tour. If a man has abused your\r\nbrother, or got drunk in the street, you do not ask him to go with you\r\nto the Yellowstone Park. But his social offences do not prevent you from\r\nsiding with him in a political convention. So, in politics itself, one\r\nmust distinguish between characters and opinions. If a man has shown\r\nhimself unscrupulous or headstrong, you may properly refuse to vote him\r\ninto office, or to sit in the same Cabinet with him, because you think\r\nthese faults of his dangerous to the country. But if the cause he pleads\r\nbe a just one, you have no more right to be prejudiced against it by his\r\nconduct than a judge has to be swayed by dislike to the counsel who\r\nargues a case. There were moderate men in America, who, in the days of\r\nthe anti-slavery movement, cited against it the intemperate language of\r\nmany abolitionists. There were aristocrats in England, who, during the\r\nstruggle for the freedom and unity of Italy, sought to discredit the\r\npatriotic party by accusing them of tyrannicide. But the sound sense of\r\nboth nations refused to be led away by such arguments, because it held\r\nthose two causes to be in their essence righteous. In all revolutionary\r\nmovements there are elements of excess and violence, which sober men may\r\nregret, but which must not disturb our judgment as to the substantial\r\nmerits of an issue. The revolutionist of one generation is, like\r\nGaribaldi or Mazzini, the hero of the next; and the verdict of posterity\r\napplauds those who, even in his own day, were able to discern the\r\njustice of the cause under the errors or faults of its champion. Doubly\r\nis it the duty of a great and far-sighted statesman not to be repelled\r\nby such errors, when he can, by espousing a revolutionary movement,\r\npurify it of its revolutionary character, and turn it into a legitimate\r\nconstitutional struggle. This is what Mr. Gladstone has done. If his\r\npolicy be in itself dangerous and disloyal to the true interests of the\r\npeople of our islands, let it be condemned. But if it be the policy\r\nwhich has the best promise for the peace, the prosperity, and the mutual\r\ngood will of those peoples, he and those who follow him would be\r\nculpable indeed were they to be deterred by the condemnation which they\r\nhave so often expressed, and which they still express, for some of the\r\npast acts of a particular party, from declaring that the aims of that\r\nparty were substantially right aims, and from now pressing upon the\r\ncountry what their conscience approves.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the Home Rule Liberals and Nationalists, taken together, are\r\nin a minority (although a minority which obtains recruits at many\r\nbye-elections) in the present Parliament, it is not from them that fresh\r\nproposals are expected. They will, of course, continue to speak, write,\r\nand agitate on behalf of the views they hold. But practical attempt to\r\ndeal with Irish troubles must for the present come from the Tory\r\nMinistry; for in the English system of government those who command a\r\nParliamentary majority are responsible for legislation as well as\r\nadministration, and are censured not merely if their legislation is bad,\r\nbut if it is not forthcoming when events call for it.\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be asked, should Lord Salisbury's Government burn its\r\nfingers over Ireland, as so many governments have burnt their fingers\r\nbefore? Why not let Ireland alone, giving to foreign affairs and to\r\nEnglish and Scottish reforms all the attention which these too much\r\nneglected matters need?\r\n\r\nWell would it be for England, as well as for English Ministries, if\r\nIreland could be simply let alone, her maladies left to be healed by the\r\nsoft, slow hand of nature. But Irish troubles call aloud to be dealt\r\nwith, and that promptly. They stand in the way of all other reforms,\r\nindeed of all other business. Letting alone has been tried, and it has\r\nsucceeded no better, even in times less urgent than the present, than\r\nthe usual policy of coercion followed by concession, or concession\r\nfollowed by coercion.\r\n\r\nThere are three aspects of the Irish question, three channels by which\r\nthe troubles of the \"distressful island\" stream down upon us, forcing\r\nwhoever now rules or may come to rule in England to attempt some plan\r\nfor dealing with them. I will take them in succession.\r\n\r\nThe first is the Parliamentary difficulty. In the British House of\r\nCommons, with its six hundred and seventy members, there are nearly\r\nninety Irish Nationalists. They are a well-disciplined body, voting as\r\none man, though capable of speaking enough for a thousand. They have no\r\ninterest in English or Scotch or colonial or Indian affairs, but only in\r\nIrish, and look upon the vote which they have the right of giving upon\r\nthe former solely as a means of furthering their own Irish aims. They\r\nare, therefore, in the British Parliament not merely a foreign body,\r\nindifferent to the great British and imperial issues confided to it, but\r\na hostile body, opposed to its present constitution, seeking to\r\ndiscredit it in its authority over Ireland, and to make more and more\r\npalpable and incurable the incompetence for Irish business whereof they\r\naccuse it. Several modes of doing this are open to them. They may, as\r\nsome of the more actively bitter among them did in the Parliaments of\r\n1874 and 1880, obstruct business by long and frequent speeches, dilatory\r\nmotions, and all those devices which in America are called\r\nfilibustering. The House of Commons may, no doubt, try to check these\r\ntactics by more stringent rules of procedure, but the attempts already\r\nmade in this direction have had but slight success, and every\r\nrestriction of debate, since it trenches on the freedom of English and\r\nScotch no less than of Irish members, injures Parliament as a whole.\r\nThey may disgust the British people with the House of Commons by keeping\r\nit (as they have done in former years) so constantly occupied with Irish\r\nbusiness as to leave it little time for English and Scotch measures.\r\nThey may throw the weight of their collective vote into the scale of one\r\nor other British party, according to the amount of concession it will\r\nmake to them, or, by always voting against the Ministry of the day, they\r\nmay cause frequent and sudden changes of Government. This plan also they\r\nhave followed in time past; for the moment it is not so applicable,\r\nbecause the Tories and dissentient Liberals, taken together, possess a\r\nmajority in the House of Commons. But at any moment the alliance of\r\nthose two sections may vanish, or another General Election may leave\r\nTories and Liberals so nearly balanced that the Irish vote could turn\r\nthe scale. Whoever reflects on the nature of Parliamentary Government\r\nwill perceive that it is based on the assumption that the members of the\r\nruling assembly, however much they may differ on other subjects, agree\r\nin desiring the strength, dignity, and welfare of the assembly itself,\r\nand in caring for the main national interests which it controls. He will\r\ntherefore be prepared to expect countless and multiform difficulties in\r\nworking such a Government, where a large section of the assembly seeks\r\nnot to use, but to make useless, its forms and rules--not to preserve,\r\nbut to lower and destroy, its honour, its credit, its efficiency. In\r\nvain are Irish members blamed for these tactics, for they answer that\r\nthe interests of their own country require them to seek first her\r\nwelfare, which can in their view be secured only by removing her from\r\nthe direct control of what they deem a foreign assembly. Now that the\r\ndemand for Irish self-government has obtained the sympathy of the bulk\r\nof English Liberals, they are unlikely forthwith to resume the\r\nsystematic obstruction of past years. But they will be able, without\r\nalienating their English friends, to render the conduct of Parliamentary\r\nbusiness so difficult that every English Ministry will be forced either\r\nto crush them, if it can, or to appease them by a series of concessions.\r\n\r\nThe second difficulty is that of maintaining social order in Ireland.\r\nWhat that difficulty is, and whence it arises, every one knows. It is\r\nchronic, but every second or third winter, when there has been a wet\r\nseason, or the price of live stock declines, it becomes specially acute.\r\nThe tenants refuse to pay rents which they declare to be impossible. The\r\nlandlords, or the harsher among them, try to enforce rents by evictions;\r\nevictions are resisted by outrages and boycotting. Popular sentiment\r\nsupports those who commit outrages, because it considers the tenantry to\r\nbe engaged in a species of war, a righteous war, against the landlord.\r\nEvidence can seldom be obtained, and juries acquit in the teeth of\r\nevidence. Thus the enforcement of the law strains all the resources of\r\nauthority, while a habit of lawlessness and discontent is transmitted\r\nfrom generation to generation. Of the remedies proposed for this chronic\r\nevil the most obvious is the strengthening of the criminal law. We have\r\nbeen trying this for more than one hundred years, since Whiteboyism\r\nappeared, and trying it in vain. Since the Union, Coercion Acts, of more\r\nor less severity, have been almost always in force in Ireland, passed\r\nfor two or three years, then dropped for a year or two, then renewed in\r\na form slightly varying, but always with the same result of driving the\r\ndisease in for a time, but not curing it. Mr. Gladstone proposed to buy\r\nout the landlords and then leave an Irish Parliament to restore social\r\norder, with that authority which it would derive from having the will of\r\nthe people behind it; because he held that when the people felt the law\r\nto be of their own making, and not imposed from without, their sentiment\r\nwould be enlisted on its side, and the necessity for a firm Government\r\nrecognized. This plan, has, however, been rejected, so the choice was\r\nleft of a fresh Coercion Act, or of some scheme, necessarily a costly\r\nscheme, for getting rid of the source of trouble by transferring the\r\nland of Ireland to the peasantry. The present Government, while guided\r\nby Sir M. Hicks-Beach, who had some knowledge of Ireland, did its best\r\nto persuade the landlords to accept reduced rents, while the Nationalist\r\nleaders, on their side, sought to restrain the people from outrages. But\r\nthe armistice did not last. The Ministry yielded to the foolish counsels\r\nof its more violent supporters, and entrusted Irish affairs to the hands\r\nof a Chief Secretary without previous knowledge of the island. An\r\nunusually severe Coercion Act has been brought in and passed by the aid\r\nof the dissentient Liberals. And we now see this Act administered with a\r\nmixture of virulence and incompetence to which even the dreary annals of\r\nIrish misgovernment present few parallels. The feeling of the English\r\npeople is rising against the policy carried out in their name. So far\r\nfrom being solved, the problem of social order becomes every day more\r\nacute.\r\n\r\nThere remains the question of a reform of local government. For many\r\nyears past, every English Ministry has undertaken to frame a measure\r\ncreating a new system of popular rural self-government in England. It is\r\nthe first large task of domestic legislation which we ask from\r\nParliament. When such a scheme is proposed, can Ireland be left out of\r\nit? Should she be left out, the argument that she is being treated\r\nunequally and unfairly, as compared with England, would gain immense\r\nforce; because the present local government of Ireland is admittedly\r\nless popular, less efficient, altogether less defensible, than even that\r\nof England which we are going to reform. If, therefore, the theory that\r\nthe Imperial Parliament is both anxious and able to do its duty by\r\nIreland is to be maintained, Ireland, too, must have her scheme of local\r\ngovernment. And a scheme of local government is a large project, the\r\ndiscussion of which must pass into a discussion of the government of the\r\nisland as a whole.\r\n\r\nSince, then, we may conclude that whatever Ministry is in power will be\r\nbound to take up the state of Ireland--since Parliament and the nation\r\nwill be occupied with the subject during the coming sessions fully as\r\nmuch as they have been during those that have recently passed--the next\r\ninquiry is, What will the tendency of opinion and legislation be? Will\r\nthe reasons and forces described above bring us to Home Rule? and if so,\r\nwhen, how, and why?\r\n\r\nThere are grounds for answering these questions in the negative. A\r\nmajority of the House of Commons, including the present Ministry and\r\nsuch influential Liberals as Mr. Bright, Lord Hartington, Mr.\r\nChamberlain, stand pledged to resist it, and seem--such is the passion\r\nwhich controversy engenders--more disposed to resist it than they were\r\nin 1885. But this ground is less strong than it may appear. We have had\r\ntoo many changes of opinion--ay, and of action too--upon Irish affairs\r\nnot to be prepared for further changes. A Ministry in power learns much\r\nwhich an Opposition fails to learn. Home Rule is an elastic expression,\r\nand some of those who were loudest in denouncing Mr. Gladstone's Bill\r\nwill find it easy to explain, should they bring in a Bill of their own\r\nfor giving self-government to Ireland, that their measure is a different\r\nthing, and free from the objections brought against his. Nor, if such a\r\nconversion should come, need it be deemed a dishonest one, for events\r\nare potent teachers, and governments now seek rather to follow than to\r\nform opinion. Although a decent interval must be allowed, no one will be\r\nastonished if the Tory leaders should move ere long in the direction\r\nindicated. Toryism itself, as has been remarked already, contains\r\nnothing opposed to the idea.\r\n\r\nFar greater obstacles exist in the aversion which (as already observed)\r\nso many Englishmen of both parties have entertained for any scheme which\r\nshould seem to leave the Protestant minority at the mercy of the peasant\r\nand Roman Catholic majority, and to carry us some way toward the\r\nultimate separation of the islands. These alarms are genuine and\r\ndeep-seated. One who (like the present writer) thinks them, if not\r\nbaseless, yet immensely overstrained, is, of course, convinced that they\r\nmay be allayed. But time must first pass, and the plan that is to allay\r\nthem may have to be framed on somewhat different lines from those of Mr.\r\nGladstone's measure. It is even possible that a conflict more sharp and\r\npainful than any of recent years may intervene before a settlement is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, great as are the obstacles in the way, bitter as are the\r\nreproaches with which Mr. Gladstone is pursued by the richer classes in\r\nEngland, there is good reason to believe that the current is setting\r\ntoward his policy. In proceeding to state the grounds for this view, I\r\nmust frankly own that I am no longer (as in most of the preceding pages)\r\nmerely setting forth facts on which impartial men in England would\r\nagree. The forecast which I seek to give may be tinged by my own belief\r\nthat the grant of self-government is the best, if not the only method,\r\nnow open to us of establishing peace between the islands, relieving the\r\nEnglish Parliament of work it is ill fitted to discharge, allowing\r\nIreland opportunities to learn those lessons in politics which her\r\npeople so much need. The future, even the near future, is more than\r\nusually dim. Yet, if we examine those three branches of the Irish\r\nquestion which have been enumerated above, we shall see how naturally,\r\nin each of them, the concession of self-government seems to open, I will\r\nnot say the most direct, but the least dangerous way, out of our\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary difficulty arises from the fact that the\r\nrepresentatives of Ireland have the feelings of foreigners sitting in a\r\nforeign assembly, whose honour and usefulness they do not desire. While\r\nthese are their feelings they cannot work properly in it, and it cannot\r\nwork properly with them. The inconvenience may be endured, but the\r\nEnglish will grow tired of it, and be disposed to rid themselves of it,\r\nif they see their way to do so without greater mischief. There are but\r\ntwo ways out of the difficulty. One is to get rid of the Irish members\r\naltogether; the other is to make them, by the concession of their just\r\ndemands, contented and loyal members of a truly united Parliament. The\r\nexperience of the Parliament of 1880, which was mainly occupied with\r\nIrish business, and began, being a strongly Liberal Parliament, with a\r\nbias toward the Irish popular party, showed how difficult it is for a\r\nHouse of Commons which is ignorant of Ireland to legislate wisely for\r\nit. In the House of Lords there is not a single Nationalist; indeed, up\r\ntill 1886, that exalted chamber contained only one peer, Lord Dalhousie\r\n(formerly member for Liverpool), who had ever said a word in favour of\r\nHome Rule. The more that England becomes sensible, as she must become\r\nsensible, of the deficiencies of the present machinery for appreciating\r\nthe needs and giving effect to the wishes of Irishmen, the more disposed\r\nwill she be to grant them some machinery of their own.\r\n\r\nAs regards social order, I have shown that the choice which lies before\r\nthe opponents of Home Rule is either to continue the policy of coercing\r\nthe peasantry by severe special legislation, or to remove the source of\r\nfriction by buying out the landlords for the benefit of the tenants. The\r\npresent Ministry have chosen the former alternative, but they dangle\r\nbefore the eyes of their supporters some prospect that they may\r\nultimately revert to the latter. Now, the only way that has yet been\r\npointed out of buying out the landlords, without imposing tremendous\r\nliabilities of loss upon the British Treasury, is the creation of a\r\nstrong Home Rule Government in Dublin. Supposing, however, that some\r\nother plan could be discovered, which would avoid the fatal objections\r\nto which an extension of the plan of the (Salisbury) Land Purchase Act\r\nof 1885 is open, such a plan would remove one of the chief objections to\r\nan Irish Parliament, by leaving no estates for such a Parliament to\r\nconfiscate. As for coercion every day, I might say, every bye-election\r\nshows us how it becomes more and more odious to the British democracy.\r\nThey dislike severity; they dislike the inequality involved in passing\r\nharsher laws for Ireland than those that apply to England and Scotland.\r\nThey find themselves forced to sympathize with acts of violence in\r\nIreland which they would condemn in Great Britain, because these acts\r\nseem the only way of resisting harsh and unjust laws. When the recoil\r\ncomes, it will be more violent than in former days. The wish to discover\r\nsome other course will be very strong, and the obvious other course will\r\nbe to leave it to an Irish authority to enforce social order in its own\r\nway--probably a more rough-and-ready way than that of British officials.\r\nThe notion which has possessed most Englishmen, that Irish\r\nself-government would be another name for anarchy, is curiously\r\nerroneous. Conflicts there may be, but a vigorous rule will emerge.\r\n\r\nLastly, as to local government. If a popular system is established in\r\nIreland--one similar to that which it is proposed to establish in\r\nEngland--the control of its assemblies and officials will, over\r\nfour-fifths of the island, fall into Nationalist hands. Their power will\r\nbe enormously increased, for they will then command the machinery of\r\nadministration, and the power of taxing. What with taxing landlords,\r\naiding recalcitrant tenants, stopping the wheels of any central\r\nauthority which may displease or oppose them, they will be in so strong\r\na position that the creation of an Irish Parliament may appear to be a\r\ncomparatively small further step, may even appear (as the wisest\r\nNationalists now think it would prove) in the light of a check upon the\r\nabuse of local powers. These eventualities will unquestionably, when\r\nEnglish opinion has realized them, make such a Parliament as the present\r\npause before it commits rural local government to the Irish democracy.\r\nBut it could not refuse to do something; and if it tried to restrain\r\npopular representative bodies by the veto of a bureaucracy in Dublin,\r\nthere would arise occasions for quarrel and irritation more serious than\r\nnow exist.[70] Those who once begin to repair an old and tottering\r\nbuilding are led on, little by little, into changes they did not at\r\nstarting contemplate. So it will be if once the task is undertaken of\r\nreforming the confessedly bad and indefensible system of Irish\r\nadministration. We may stop at some half-way house on the way, but Home\r\nRule stands at the end of the road.\r\n\r\nSupposing, then, that the Nationalist party, retaining its present\r\nstrength and unity, perseveres in its present demands, there is every\r\nprospect that these demands will be granted. But will it persevere?\r\nThere are among the English Dissentients those who prophesy that it will\r\nbreak up, as such parties have broken up before--will lose hope and\r\nwither away. Or the support of the Irish peasantry may be withdrawn--a\r\nresult which some English politicians expect from a final settlement of\r\nthe land question in the interest of the tenants. Any of these\r\ncontingencies is possible, but at present most improbable. The moment\r\nwhen long-cherished aims begin to seem attainable is not that at which\r\nmen are disposed to abandon them.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other reasons which suggest the likelihood of a\r\nchange in English sentiment on the whole matter. The surprise with\r\nwhich the Bill of last April was received has worn off. The alarm is\r\nwearing off too. Those who set their teeth at what seemed to them a\r\nsurrender to the Parnellites and their Irish-American allies, having\r\nrelieved their temper by an emphatic No, have begun to ponder things\r\nmore calmly. The English people are listening to the arguments from\r\nIrish history that are now addressed to them. They will be moved by the\r\nsolid grounds of policy which that history suggests; will understand\r\nthat what they have deemed insensate hatred is the natural result of\r\nlong misgovernment, and will disappear with time and the removal of its\r\ncauses. Many of the best minds of both nations will be at work to\r\ndiscover some method of reconciling Irish self-government with imperial\r\nsupremacy and union free from the objections brought against the Bills\r\nof 1886. It is reasonable to expect that they may greatly improve upon\r\nthese measures, which were prepared under pressure from a clamorous\r\nOpposition. What Mr. Disraeli once called the historical conscience of\r\nthe country will appreciate those great underlying principles to which\r\nMr. Gladstone's policy appeals. It has been accused of being a policy of\r\ndespair; and may have commended itself to some who supported it as being\r\nsimply a means of ridding England of responsibility. But to others it\r\nseemed, and more truly, a policy of faith; not, indeed, of thoughtless\r\noptimism, but of faith according to the definition which calls it \"the\r\nsubstance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" Faith,\r\nby which nations as well as men must live, means nothing less than a\r\nconviction that great principles, permanent truths of human nature, lie\r\nat the bottom of all sound politics, and ought to be boldly and\r\nconsistently applied, even when temporary difficulties surround their\r\napplication. Such a principle is the belief in the power of freedom and\r\nself-government to cure the faults of a nation, in the tendency of\r\nresponsibility to teach wisdom, and to make men see that justice and\r\norder are the surest sources of prosperity. Such a principle is the\r\nperception that national hatreds do not live on of themselves, but will\r\nexpire when oppression has ceased, as a fire burns out without fuel.\r\nSuch a principle is the recognition of the force of national sentiment,\r\nand of the duty of allowing it all the satisfaction that is compatible\r\nwith the maintenance of imperial unity. Such, again, is the appreciation\r\nof those natural economic laws which show that nations, when disturbing\r\npassions have ceased, follow their own permanent interests, and that an\r\nisland which finds its chief market in England and draws its capital\r\nfrom England will prefer a connection with England to the poverty and\r\ninsignificance of isolation. It is the honour of Mr. Gladstone to have\r\nbuilt his policy of conciliation upon principles like these, as upon a\r\nrock; and already the good effects are seen in the new friendliness\r\nwhich has arisen between the English masses and the people of Ireland,\r\nand in the better temper with which, despite the acrimony of some\r\nprominent politicians, the relations of the two peoples are discussed.\r\nWhen one looks round the horizon it is still far from clear; nor can we\r\nsay from which quarter fair weather will arrive. But the air is fresher,\r\nand the clouds are breaking overhead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened since the above paragraphs were written, ten months\r\nago, has confirmed more quickly and completely than the writer expected\r\nthe forecasts they contain. Home Rule is no longer a word of terror,\r\neven to those English and Scotch voters who were opposed to it in July,\r\n1886. Most sensible men in the Tory and Dissentient Liberal camps have\r\ncome to see that it is inevitable; and, while they continue to resist\r\nit for the sake of what is called consistency, or because they do not\r\nyet see in what form it is to be granted, they are disposed to regard\r\nits speedy arrival as the best method of retreat from an indefensible\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe repressive policy which the present Ministry are attempting in\r\nIreland--for in the face of their failures one cannot say that they are\r\ncarrying out any policy--is rendering Coercion Acts more and more\r\ndetested by the English people. The actualities of Ireland, the social\r\ncondition of her peasantry, the unwisdom of the dominant caste, the\r\nincompetence of the bureaucracy which affects to rule her, are being, by\r\nthe full accounts we now receive, brought home to the mind of England\r\nand Scotland as they never were before, and produce their appropriate\r\neffect upon the heart and conscience of the people. The recognition by\r\nthe Liberal party of the rights of Ireland, the visits of English\r\nLiberals to Ireland, the work done by Irishmen in English\r\nconstituencies, are creating a feeling of unity and reciprocal interest\r\nbetween the masses of the people on both sides of the Channel without\r\nexample in the seven hundred years that have passed since Strongbow's\r\nlanding.\r\n\r\nThis was the thing most needed to make Home Rule safe and full of\r\npromise, because it affords a guarantee that in such political contests\r\nas may arise in future, the division will not be, as heretofore, between\r\nthe Irish people on the one side and the power of Britain on the other,\r\nbut between two parties, each of which will have adherents in both\r\nislands. We may now at last hope that national hatreds will vanish; that\r\nEngland will unlearn her arrogance and Ireland her suspicion; that the\r\nbasis is being laid for a harmonious co-operation of both nations in\r\npromoting the welfare and greatness of a common Empire.\r\n\r\nMany of the Irish patriots of 1798 and 1848 desired Separation, because\r\nthey thought that Ireland, attached to England, could never be more\r\nthan the obscure satellite of a greater State. When Ireland has been\r\nheartily welcomed by the democracy of Great Britain as an equal partner,\r\nthe ground for any such desire will have disappeared, and Union will\r\nrest on a foundation firmer than has ever before existed. Ireland will\r\nfeel, when those rights of self-government have been secured for which\r\nshe has pleaded so long, that she owes them, not only to her own\r\ntenacity and courage, but to the magnanimity, the justice, and the\r\nfreely given sympathy of the English and Scottish people.\r\n\r\n_October_, 1887.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: This article, which originally appeared in the American\r\n_New Princeton Review_, has been added to in a few places, in order to\r\nbring its narrative of facts up to date.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: The experience of the last few months, which has shown us\r\nrural Boards of Guardians and municipal bodies over four-fifths of\r\nIreland displaying their zeal in the Nationalist cause, has amply\r\nconfirmed this anticipation, expressed nearly a year ago.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ARGUMENTS CONSIDERED.[71]\r\n\r\nBY JOHN MORLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a favourite line of argument to show that we have no choice\r\nbetween the maintenance of the Union and the concession to Ireland of\r\nnational independence. The evils of Irish independence are universally\r\nreckoned by Englishmen to be so intolerable that we shall never agree to\r\nit. The evils of Home Rule are even more intolerable still. Therefore,\r\nit is said, if we shall never willingly bring the latter upon our heads,\r\n_à fortiori_ we ought on no account to invite the former. The business\r\nin hand, however, is not a theorem, but a problem; it is not a thesis to\r\nbe proved, but a malady to be cured; and the world will thank only the\r\nreasoner who winds up, not with Q.E.D., but with Q.E.F. To reason that a\r\npatient ought not to take a given medicine because it may possibly cause\r\nhim more pain than some other medicine which he has no intention of\r\ntaking, is curiously oblique logic. The question is not oblique; it is\r\ndirect. Will the operation do more harm to his constitution than the\r\nslow corrosions of a disorder grown inveterate? Are the conditions of\r\nthe connection between England and Ireland, as laid down in the Act of\r\nUnion, incapable of improvement? Is the present working of these\r\nconditions more prosperous and hopeful, or happier for Irish order and\r\nfor English institutions, than any practicable proposal that it is\r\nwithin the compass of statesmanship to devise, and of civic sense to\r\naccept and to work? That is the question.\r\n\r\nSome people contend that the burden of making out a case rests on the\r\nadvocate of change, and not on those who support things as they are. But\r\nwho supports things as they are? Things as they are have become\r\ninsupportable. If you make any of the constitutional changes that have\r\nbeen proposed, we are told, parliamentary government, as Englishmen now\r\nknow it, is at an end; and our critic stands amazed at those \"who deem\r\nit a slighter danger to innovate on the Act of Union than to remodel the\r\nprocedure of the House of Commons.\" As if that were the alternative.\r\nGreat changes in the rules may do other good things, but no single\r\ncompetent authority believes that in this particular they will do the\r\nthing that we want. We cannot avoid constitutional changes. It is made\r\nmatter of crushing rebuke that the Irish proposals of the late\r\nGovernment were an innovation on the old constitution of the realm. But\r\neverybody knows that, while ancient forms have survived, the last\r\nhundred years have witnessed a long succession of silent but most\r\nprofound innovations. It was shortsighted to assume that the\r\nredistribution of political power that took place in 1884-5 was the last\r\nchapter of the history of constitutional change. It ought to have been\r\nforeseen that new possessors of power, both Irish and British, would\r\npress for objects the pursuit of which would certainly involve further\r\nnovelties in the methods and machinery of government. Every given\r\ninnovation must be rigorously scrutinized, but in the mere change or in\r\nthe fact of innovation there is no valid reproach. When one of the\r\nplans for the better government of Ireland is described as depriving\r\nparliamentary institutions of their elasticity and strength, as\r\nweakening the Executive at home, and lessening the power of the country\r\nto resist foreign attack, no careful observer of the events of the last\r\nseven years can fail to see that all this evil has already got its grip\r\nupon us. Mr. Dicey himself admits it. \"Great Britain,\" he says, \"if left\r\nto herself, could act with all the force, consistency, and energy given\r\nby unity of sentiment and community of interests. The obstruction and\r\nthe uncertainty of our political aims, the feebleness and inconsistency\r\nwith which they are pursued, arise in part at least from the connection\r\nwith Ireland.\" So then, after all, it is feebleness and inconsistency,\r\nnot elasticity and strength, that mark our institutions as they stand;\r\nfeebleness and inconsistency, distraction and uncertainty. The supporter\r\nof things as they are is decidedly as much concerned in making out a\r\ncase as the advocate of change.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the argument from Nationality is great, and full of\r\nsignificance; but Nationality is not the whole essence of either the\r\nargument from History or the argument from Self-government. Their force\r\nlies in considerations of political expediency as tested by practical\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe point of the argument from the lessons of History is that for some\r\nreason or another the international concern, whose unlucky affairs we\r\nare now trying to unravel, has always been carried on at a loss: the\r\npoint of the argument from Self-government is that the loss would have\r\nbeen avoided if the Irish shareholders had for a certain number of the\r\ntransactions been more influentially represented on the Board. That is\r\nquite apart from the sentiment of pure nationality. The failure has come\r\nabout, not simply because the laws were not made by Irishmen as such,\r\nbut because they were not made by the men who knew most about Ireland.\r\nThe vice of the connection between the two countries has been the\r\nstupidity of governing a country without regard to the interests or\r\ncustoms, the peculiar objects and peculiar experiences, of the great\r\nmajority of the people who live in it. It is not enough to say that the\r\nfailures of England in Ireland have to a great extent flowed from causes\r\ntoo general to be identified with the intentional wrong-doing either of\r\nrulers or of subjects. We readily admit that, but it is not the point.\r\nIt is not enough to insist that James I., in his plantations and\r\ntransplantations, probably meant well to his Irish subjects. Probably he\r\ndid. That is not the question. If it is \"absolutely certain that his\r\npolicy worked gross wrong,\" what is the explanation and the defence? We\r\nare quite content with Mr. Dicey's own answer. \"Ignorance and want of\r\nsympathy produced all the evils of cruelty and malignity. An intended\r\nreform produced injustice, litigation, misery, and discontent. The case\r\nis noticeable, for it is a type of a thousand subsequent English\r\nattempts to reform and improve Ireland.\" This description would apply,\r\nwith hardly a word altered, to the wrong done by the Encumbered Estates\r\nAct in the reign of Queen Victoria. That memorable measure, as Mr.\r\nGladstone said, was due not to the action of a party, but to the action\r\nof a Parliament. Sir Robert Peel was hardly less responsible for it than\r\nLord John Russell. \"We produced it,\" said Mr. Gladstone, \"with a\r\ngeneral, lazy, uninformed, and irreflective good intention of taking\r\ncapital to Ireland. What did we do? We sold the improvements of the\r\ntenants\" (House of Commons, April 16). It is the same story, from the\r\nfirst chapter to the last, in education, poor law, public works, relief\r\nActs, even in coercion Acts--lazy, uninformed, and irreflective good\r\nintention. That is the argument from history. When we are asked what\r\ngood law an Irish Parliament would make that could not equally well be\r\nmade by the Parliament at Westminster, this is the answer. It is not\r\nthe will, it is the intelligence, that is wanting. We all know what the\r\npast has been. Why should the future be different?\r\n\r\n\"It is an inherent condition of human affairs,\" said Mill in a book\r\nwhich, in spite of some chimeras, is a wholesome corrective of the\r\nteaching of our new jurists, \"that no intention, however sincere, of\r\nprotecting the interests of others can make it safe or salutary to tie\r\nup their own hands. Still more obviously true is it, that by their own\r\nhands only can any positive and durable improvement of their\r\ncircumstances in life be worked out\" (_Repres. Government_, p. 57). It\r\nis these wise lessons from human experience to which the advocate of\r\nHome Rule appeals, and not the wild doctrine that any body of persons\r\nclaiming to be united by a sense of nationality possesses _an inherent\r\nand divine right_ to be treated as an independent community. It is quite\r\ntrue that circumstances sometimes justify a temporary dictatorship. In\r\nthat there is nothing at variance with Liberalism. But the Parliamentary\r\ndictatorship in Ireland has lasted a great deal too long to be called\r\ntemporary, and its stupid shambling operations are finally and\r\ndecisively condemned by their consequences. That is a straightforward\r\nutilitarian argument, and has nothing whatever to do with inherent and\r\ndivine rights, or any other form of political moonshine.\r\n\r\nThere are some who believe that an honest centralized administration of\r\nimpartial officials, and not Local Self-Government, would best meet the\r\nreal wants of the people. In other words, everything is to be for the\r\npeople, nothing by the people--which has not hitherto been a Liberal\r\nprinciple. Something, however, may be said for this view, provided that\r\nthe source of the authority of such an administration be acceptable.\r\nAustrian administration in Lombardy was good rather than bad, yet it was\r\nhated and resisted because it was Austrian and not Italian. No rational\r\nperson can hold for an instant that the source of a scheme of\r\ngovernment is immaterial to its prosperity. More than that, when people\r\nlook for success in the government of Ireland to \"honest centralized\r\nadministration,\" we cannot but wonder what fault they find with the\r\nadministration of Ireland to-day in respect of its honesty or its\r\ncentralization. What administration ever carried either honesty or\r\ncentralization to a higher pitch than the Irish administration of Mr.\r\nForster? What could be less successful? Those who have been most\r\ndirectly concerned in the government of Ireland, whether English or\r\nIrish, even while alive to the perils of any other principle, habitually\r\ntalk of centralization as the curse of the system. Here, again, why\r\nshould we expect success in the future from a principle that has so\r\nfailed in the past?\r\n\r\nAgain, how are we to get a strong centralized administration in the face\r\nof a powerful and hostile parliamentary representation? It is very easy\r\nto talk of the benefits that might have been conferred on Ireland by\r\nsuch humanity and justice as was practised by Turgot in his\r\nadministration of the Generality of Limoges. But Turgot was not\r\nconfronted by eighty-six Limousin members of an active sovereign body,\r\nall interested in making his work difficult, and trusted by a large\r\nproportion of the people of the province with that as their express\r\ncommission. It is possible to have an honest centralized administration\r\nof great strength and activity in India, but there is no Parliament in\r\nIndia. If India, or any province of it, ever gets representative\r\ngovernment and our parliamentary system, from that hour, if there be any\r\nconsiderable section of Indian feeling averse from European rule, the\r\npresent administrative system will be paralyzed, as the preliminary to\r\nbeing revolutionized. It is conceivable, if any one chooses to think so,\r\nthat a body of impartial officials could manage the national business in\r\nIreland much better without the guidance of public opinion and common\r\nsentiment than with it. But if you intend to govern the country as you\r\nthink best--and that is the plain and practical English of centralized\r\nadministration--why ask the country to send a hundred men to the great\r\ntribunal of supervision to inform you how it would like to be governed?\r\nThe Executive cannot set them aside as if they were a hundred dummies;\r\nin refusing to be guided, it cannot escape being harassed, by them. You\r\nmay amend procedure, but that is no answer, unless you amend the Irish\r\nmembers out of voice and vote. They will still count. You cannot gag and\r\nmuzzle them effectually, and if you could, they would still be there,\r\nand their presence would still make itself incessantly felt. Partly from\r\na natural desire to lessen the common difficulties of government, and\r\npartly from a consciousness, due to the prevailing state of the modern\r\npolitical atmosphere, that there is something wrong in this total\r\nalienation of an Executive from the possessors of parliamentary power,\r\nthe officials will incessantly be tempted to make tacks out of their own\r\ncourse; and thus they lose the coherency and continuity of absolutism\r\nwithout gaining the pliant strength of popular government. This is not a\r\npresumption of what would be likely to happen, but an account of what\r\ndoes happen, and what justified Mr. Disraeli in adding a weak Executive\r\nto the alien Church and the absentee aristocracy, as the three great\r\ncurses of Ireland. Nothing has occurred since 1844 to render the\r\nExecutive stronger, but much to the contrary. There is, and there can\r\nbe, no weaker or less effective Government in the world than a highly\r\ncentralized system working alongside of a bitterly inimical popular\r\nrepresentation. I say nothing of the effect of the fluctuations of\r\nEnglish parties on Irish administration. I say nothing of the tendency\r\nin an Irish government, awkwardly alternating with that to which I have\r\njust adverted, to look over the heads of the people of Ireland, and to\r\nconsider mainly what will be thought by the ignorant public in England.\r\nBut these sources of incessant perturbation must not be left out. The\r\nfault of Irish centralization is not that it is strong, but that it is\r\nweak. Weak it must remain until Parliament either approves of the\r\npermanent suspension of the Irish writs, or else devises constitutional\r\nmeans for making Irish administration responsible to Irish\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIf experience is decisive against the policy of the past, experience\r\ntoo, all over the modern world, indicates the better direction for the\r\nfuture. I will not use my too scanty space in repeating any of the great\r\nwise commonplaces in praise of self-government. Here they are\r\nsuperfluous. In the case of Ireland they have all been abundantly\r\nadmitted in a long series of measures, from Catholic Emancipation down\r\nto Lord O'Hagan's Jury Law and the Franchise and Redistribution Acts of\r\na couple of years ago. The principle of self-government has been\r\naccepted, ratified, and extended in a hundred ways. It is only a\r\nquestion of the form that self-government shall take. Against the form\r\nproposed by the late Ministry a case is built up that rests on a series\r\nof prophetic assumptions. These assumptions, from the nature of the\r\ncase, can only be met by a counter-statement of fair and reasonable\r\nprobabilities. Let us enumerate some of them.\r\n\r\n1. It is inferred that, because the Irish leaders have used violent\r\nlanguage and resorted to objectionable expedients against England during\r\nthe last six years, they would continue in the same frame of mind after\r\nthe reasons for it had disappeared. In other words, because they have\r\nbeen the enemies of a Government which refused to listen to a\r\nconstitutional demand, therefore they would continue to be its enemies\r\nafter the demand had been listened to. On this reasoning, the effect is\r\nto last indefinitely and perpetually, notwithstanding the cessation of\r\nthe cause. Our position is that all the reasonable probabilities of\r\nhuman conduct point the other way. The surest way of justifying violent\r\nlanguage and fostering treasonable designs, is to refuse to listen to\r\nthe constitutional demand.\r\n\r\n2. The Irish, we are told, hate the English with an irreconcilable\r\nhatred, and would unquestionably use any Constitution as an instrument\r\nfor satisfying their master passion. Irrational hatred, they say, can be\r\ntreated by rational men with composure. The Czechs of Bohemia are said\r\nto be irreconcilable, yet the South Germans bear with their hatred; and\r\nif we cannot cure we might endure the antipathy of Ireland. Now, as for\r\nthe illustration, I may remark that the hatred of the Czechs would be\r\nmuch too formidable for German composure, if the Czechs did not happen\r\nto possess a provincial charter and a special constitution of their own.\r\nIf the Irish had the same, their national dislike--so far as it\r\nexists--might be expected to become as bearable as the Germans have\r\nfound the feeling of the Czechs. But how deep does Irish dislike go? Is\r\nit directed against Englishmen, or against an English official system?\r\nThe answers of every impartial observer to the whole group of such\r\nquestions as these favour the conclusion that the imputed hatred of\r\nEngland in Ireland has been enormously exaggerated and overcoloured by\r\nAscendency politicians for good reasons of their own; that with the\r\ngreat majority of Irishmen it has no deep roots; that it is not one of\r\nthose passionate international animosities that blind men to their own\r\ninterests, or lead them to sacrifice themselves for the sake of injuring\r\ntheir foe; and, finally, that it would not survive the amendment of the\r\nsystem that has given it birth.[72]\r\n\r\n3. It is assumed that there is a universal desire for Separation. That\r\nthere is a strong sentiment of nationality we of course admit; it is\r\npart of the case, and not the worst part. But the sentiment of\r\nnationality is a totally different thing from a desire for Separation.\r\nScotland might teach our pseudo-Unionists so much as that. Nowhere in\r\nthe world is the sentiment of nationality stronger, yet there is not a\r\nwhisper of Separation. That there is a section of Irishmen who desire\r\nSeparation is notorious, but everything that has happened since the\r\nGovernment of Ireland Bill was introduced, including the remarkable\r\ndeclarations of Mr. Parnell in accepting the Bill (June 7), and\r\nincluding the proceedings at Chicago, shows that the separatist section\r\nis a very small one either in Ireland or in America, and that it has\r\nbecome sensibly smaller since, and in consequence of, the proposed\r\nconcession of a limited statutory constitution. The Irish are quite\r\nshrewd enough to know that Separation, if it were attainable--and they\r\nare well aware that it is not--would do no good to their markets; and to\r\nthat knowledge, as well as to many other internal considerations, we may\r\nconfidently look for the victory of strong centripetal over very weak\r\ncentrifugal tendencies. Even if we suppose these centrifugal tendencies\r\nto be stronger than I would allow them to be, how shall we best resist\r\nthem--by strengthening the hands and using the services of the party\r\nwhich, though nationalist, is also constitutional; or by driving that\r\nparty also, in despair of a constitutional solution, to swell the ranks\r\nof Extremists and Irreconcilables?\r\n\r\n4. Whatever may be the ill-feeling towards England, it is at least\r\nundeniable that there are bitter internal animosities in Ireland, and a\r\npolitical constitution, our opponents argue, can neither assuage\r\nreligious bigotry nor remove agrarian discontent.\r\n\r\nIt is true, no doubt, that the old feud between Protestant and Catholic\r\nmight, perhaps, not instantly die down to the last smouldering embers of\r\nit all over Ireland. But we may remark that there is no perceptible bad\r\nblood between Protestant and Catholic, outside of one notorious corner.\r\nSecond, the real bitterness of the feud arose from the fact that\r\nProtestantism was associated with an exclusive and hostile ascendency,\r\nwhich would now be brought to an end. Whatever feeling about what is\r\ncalled Ulster exists in the rest of Ireland, arises not from the fact\r\nthat there are Protestants in Ulster, but that the Protestants are\r\nanti-National. Third, the Catholics would no longer be one compact body\r\nfor persecuting, obscurantist, or any other evil purposes; the abatement\r\nof the national struggle would allow the Catholics to fall into the two\r\nnatural divisions of Clerical and Liberal. What we may be quite sure of\r\nis that the feud will never die so long as sectarian pretensions are\r\ntaken as good reasons for continuing bad government.\r\n\r\nIt is true, again, that a constitution would not necessarily remove\r\nagrarian discontent. But it is just as true that you will never remove\r\nagrarian discontent without a constitution. Mr. Dicey, on consideration,\r\nwill easily see why. Here we come to an illustration, and a very\r\nimpressive illustration it is, of the impotence of England to do for\r\nIreland the good which Ireland might do for herself. Nobody just now is\r\nlikely to forget the barbarous condition of the broad fringe of\r\nwretchedness on the west coast of Ireland. Of this Lord Dufferin truly\r\nsaid in 1880 that no legislation could touch it, that no alteration in\r\nthe land laws could effectually ameliorate it, and that it must continue\r\nuntil the world's end unless something be contrived totally to change\r\nthe conditions of existence in that desolate region. Parliament lavishly\r\npours water into the sieve in the shape of Relief Acts. Even in my own\r\nshort tenure of office I was responsible for one of these terribly\r\nwasteful and profoundly unsatisfactory measures. Instead of relief, what\r\na statesman must seek is prevention of this great evil and strong root\r\nof evil; and prevention means a large, though it cannot be a very swift,\r\ndisplacement of the population. But among the many experts with whom I\r\nhave discussed this dolorous and perplexing subject, I never found one\r\nof either political party who did not agree that a removal of the\r\nsurplus population was only practicable if carried out by an Irish\r\nauthority, backed by the solid weight of Irish opinion. Any exertion of\r\ncompulsory power by a British Minister would raise the whole\r\ncountry-side in squalid insurrection, government would become\r\nimpossible, and the work of transplantation would end in ghastly\r\nfailure. It is misleading and untrue, then, to say that there is no\r\npossible relation between self-government and agrarian discontent,\r\nmisery, and backwardness; and when Mr. Dicey and others tell us that the\r\nBritish Parliament is able to do all good things for Ireland, I would\r\nrespectfully ask them how a British Parliament is to deal with the\r\nCongested Districts.\r\n\r\nNearly as much may be said of the prevention of the mischievous practice\r\nof Subdivision. Some contend that the old disposition to subdivide is\r\ndying out; others, however, assure us that it is making its appearance\r\neven among the excellent class who purchased their holdings under the\r\nChurch Act. That Act did not prohibit subdivision, but it is prohibited\r\nin the Act of 1881. Still the prohibition can only be made effective, if\r\noperations take place on anything like a great scale, on condition that\r\nrepresentative, authorities resident on the spot have the power of\r\nenforcing it, and have an interest in enforcing it. Some of the\r\npseudo-Unionists are even against any extension of local\r\nself-government, and if it be unaccompanied by the creation of a central\r\nnative authority they are right. What such people fail to see is that,\r\nin resisting political reconstruction, they are at the same time\r\nresisting the only available remedies for some of the worst of agrarian\r\nmaladies.\r\n\r\nThe ruinous interplay between agrarian and political forces, each using\r\nthe other for ends of its own, will never cease so long as the political\r\ndemand is in every form resisted. That, we are told, is all the fault of\r\nthe politicians. Be it so; then the Government must either suppress the\r\npoliticians outright, or else it must interest them in getting the terms\r\nof its land settlement accepted and respected. Home Rule on our scheme\r\nwas, among other things, part of an arrangement for \"settling the\r\nagrarian feud.\" It was a means of interposing between the Irish tenant\r\nand the British State an authority interested enough and strong enough\r\nto cause the bargain to be kept. It is said that the Irish authority\r\nwould have had neither interest nor strength enough to resist the forces\r\nmaking for repudiation. Would those forces be any less irresistible if\r\nthe whole body of the Irish peasantry stood, as Land Purchase _minus_\r\nSelf-Government makes them to stand, directly face to face with the\r\nBritish State? This is a question that our opponents cannot evade, any\r\nmore than they can evade that other question, which lies unnoticed at\r\nthe back of all solutions of the problem by way of peasant\r\nownership--Whether it is possible to imagine the land of Ireland handed\r\nover to Irishmen, and yet the government of Ireland kept exclusively and\r\ndirectly by Englishmen? Such a divorce is conceivable under a rule like\r\nthat of the British in India: with popular institutions it is\r\ninconceivable and impossible.\r\n\r\n5. It is argued that Home Rule on Mr. Gladstone's plan would not work,\r\nbecause it follows in some respects the colonial system, whereas the\r\nconditions at the root of the success of the system in the Colonies do\r\nnot exist in Ireland. They are distant, Ireland is near; they are\r\nprosperous, Ireland is poor; they are proud of the connection with\r\nEngland, Ireland resents it. But the question is not whether the\r\nconditions are identical with those of any colony; it is enough if in\r\nthemselves they seem to promise a certain basis for government. It might\r\njustly be contended that proximity is a more favourable condition than\r\ndistance; without it there could not be that close and constant\r\nintercommunication which binds the material interests of Ireland to\r\nthose of Great Britain, and so provides the surest guarantee for union.\r\nIf Ireland were suddenly to find herself as far off as Canada, then\r\nindeed one might be very sorry to answer for the Union. Again, though\r\nIreland has to bear her share of the prevailing depression in the chief\r\nbranch of her production, it is a great mistake to suppose that outside\r\nof the margin of chronic wretchedness in the west and south-west, the\r\ncondition not only of the manufacturing industries of the north, but of\r\nthe agricultural industry in the richer parts of the middle and south,\r\nis so desperately unprosperous as to endanger a political constitution.\r\nUnder our stupidily [Transcriber: sic] centralized system, Irishmen have\r\nno doubt acquired the enervating trick of attributing every misfortune,\r\ngreat or small, public or private, to the Government. When they learn\r\nthe lessons of responsibility, they will unlearn this fatal habit, and\r\nnot before.\r\n\r\nI do not see, therefore, that the differences in condition between\r\nIreland and the Colonies make against Home Rule. What I do see is ample\r\nmaterial out of which would arise a strong and predominant party of\r\norder. The bulk of the nation are sons and daughters of a Church which\r\nhas been hostile to revolution in every country but Ireland, and which\r\nwould be hostile to it there from the day that the cause of revolution\r\nceased to be the cause of self-government. If the peasantry were made to\r\nrealize that at last the land settlement, wisely and equitably made, was\r\nwhat it must inexorably remain, and what no politicians could help them\r\nto alter, they would be as conservative as the peasantry under a similar\r\ncondition in every other spot on the surface of the globe. There is no\r\nreason to expect that the manufacturers, merchants, and shopkeepers of\r\nIreland would be less willing or less able to play an active and useful\r\npart in the affairs of their country than the same classes in England or\r\nScotland. It will be said that this is mere optimist prophesying. But\r\nwhy is that to be flung aside under the odd name of sentimentalism,\r\nwhile pessimist prophesying is to be taken for gospel?\r\n\r\nThe only danger is lest we should allot new responsibilities to Irishmen\r\nwith a too grudging and restrictive hand. For true responsibility there\r\nmust be real power. It is easy to say that this power would be misused,\r\nand that the conditions both of Irish society and of the proposed\r\nConstitution must prevent it from being used for good. It is easy to say\r\nthat separation would be a better end. Life is too short to discuss\r\nthat. Separation is not the alternative either to Home Rule or to the\r\n_status quo_. If the people of Ireland are not to be trusted with real\r\npower over their own affairs, it would be a hundred times more just to\r\nEngland, and more merciful to Ireland, to take away from her that\r\nsemblance of free government which torments and paralyzes one country,\r\nwhile it robs the other of national self-respect and of all the\r\nstrongest motives and best opportunities of self-help. The _status quo_\r\nis drawing very near to its inevitable end. The two courses then open\r\nwill be Home Rule on the one hand, and some shy bungling underhand\r\nimitation of a Crown Colony on the other. We shall have either to listen\r\nto the Irish representatives or to suppress them. Unless we have lost\r\nall nerve and all political faculty we shall, before many months are\r\nover, face these alternatives. Liberals are for the first; Tories at\r\npresent incline to the second. It requires very moderate instinct for\r\nthe forces at work in modern politics to foresee the path along which we\r\nshall move, in the interests alike of relief to Great Britain and of a\r\nsounder national life for Ireland. The only real question is not Whether\r\nwe are to grant Home Rule, but How.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: The following pages, with one or two slight alterations,\r\nare extracted, by the kind permission of Mr. James Knowles, from two\r\narticles which were published in the _Nineteenth Century_ at the\r\nbeginning of the present year, in reply to Professor Dicey's statement\r\nof the English case against Home Rule.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: The late J.E.

GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIreland for more than seven hundred years has been part of the British\r\nterritory, and has been with slight exceptions held by English arms, or\r\ngoverned in the last resort from this side the water. Scotland was a\r\nforeign country until 1603, and possessed absolute independence until\r\n1707. Yet, whether it was due to the standing barrier of the sea, or\r\nwhatever may have been the cause, much less was known by Englishmen of\r\nIreland than of Scotland. Witness the works of Shakespeare, whose mind,\r\nunless as to book-knowledge, was encyclopædic, and yet who, while he\r\nseems at home in Scotland, may be said to tell us nothing of Ireland,\r\nunless it is that--\r\n\r\n    \"The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms.\"[73]\r\n\r\nDuring more recent times, the knowledge of Scotland on this side the\r\nborder, which before was greatly in advance, has again increased in afar\r\ngreater degree than the knowledge of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt is to Mr. Lecky that we owe the first serious effort, both in his\r\n_Leaders of Public Opinion_ and in his _History of England in the\r\nEighteenth Century_, to produce a better state of things. He carefully\r\nand completely dovetailed the affairs of Ireland into English History,\r\nand the debt is one to be gratefully acknowledged. But such remedies,\r\naddressing themselves in the first instance to the lettered mind of the\r\ncountry, require much time to operate upon the mass, and upon the organs\r\nof superficial and transitory opinion, before the final stage, when they\r\nenter into our settled and familiar traditions. Meantime, since Ireland\r\nthreatens to absorb into herself our Parliamentary life, there is a\r\ngreatly enhanced necessity for becoming acquainted with the true state\r\nof the account between the islands that make up the United Kingdom, and\r\nwith the likelihoods of the future in Ireland, so far as they are to be\r\ngathered from her past history.\r\n\r\nThat history, until the eighteenth century begins, has a dismal\r\nsimplicity about it. Murder, persecution, confiscation too truly\r\ndescribe its general strain; and policy is on the whole subordinated to\r\nviolence as the standing instrument of government. But after, say, the\r\nreign of William III., the element of representation begins to assert\r\nitself. Simplicity is by degrees exchanged for complexity; the play of\r\nhuman motives, singularly diversified, now becomes visible in the\r\ncurrents of a real public life. It has for a very long time been my\r\nhabit, when consulted by young political students, to recommend them\r\ncarefully to study the characters and events of the American\r\nIndependence. Quite apart from the special and temporary reasons bearing\r\nupon the case, I would now add a twin recommendation to examine and\r\nponder the lessons of Irish history during the eighteenth century. The\r\ntask may not be easy, but the reward will be ample.\r\n\r\nThe mainspring of public life had, from a venerable antiquity, lain _de\r\njure_ within Ireland herself. The heaviest fetter upon this life was the\r\nLaw of Poynings; the most ingenious device upon record for hamstringing\r\nlegislative independence, because it cut off the means of resumption\r\ninherent in the nature of Parliaments such as were those of the three\r\ncountries. But the Law of Poynings was an Irish Law. Its operation\r\neffectually aided on the civil side those ruder causes, under the action\r\nof which Ireland had lain for four centuries usually passive, and\r\nbleeding at every pore. The main factors of her destiny worked, in\r\npractice, from this side the water. But from the reign of Anne, or\r\nperhaps from the Revolution onwards,\r\n\r\n    \"Novus sæcorum nascitur ordo.\"\r\n\r\nOf the three great nostrums so liberally applied by England, extirpation\r\nand persecution had entirely failed, but confiscation had done its work.\r\nThe great Protestant landlordism of Ireland[74] had been strongly and\r\neffectually built up. But, like other human contrivances, while it held\r\nIreland fast, it had also undesigned results. The repressed principle of\r\nnational life, the struggles of which had theretofore been extinguished\r\nin blood, slowly sprang up anew in a form which, though extremely\r\nnarrow, and extravagantly imperfect, was armed with constitutional\r\nguarantees; and, the regimen of violence once displaced, these\r\nguarantees were sure to operate. What had been transacted in England\r\nunder Plantagenets and Stuarts was, to a large extent, transacted anew\r\nby the Parliament of Ireland in the eighteenth century. That Parliament,\r\nindeed, deserves almost every imaginable epithet of censure. It was\r\ncorrupt, servile, selfish, cruel. But when we have said all this, and\r\nsaid it truly, there is more to tell. It was alive, and it was national.\r\nEven absenteeism, that obstinately clinging curse, though it enfeebled\r\nand distracted, could not, and did not, annihilate nationality. The\r\nIrish Legislation was, moreover, compressed and thwarted by a foreign\r\nexecutive; but even to this tremendous agent the vital principle was\r\ntoo strong eventually to succumb.\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky well observes that the Irish case supplied \"one of the most\r\nstriking examples upon record\"[75] of an unconquerable efficacy in even\r\nthe most defective Parliament. I am, however, doubtful whether in this\r\nproposition we have before us the whole case. This efficacy is not\r\ninvariably found even in tolerably constructed Parliaments. Why do we\r\nfind it in a Parliament of which the constitution and the environment\r\nwere alike intolerable? My answer is, because that Parliament found\r\nitself faced by a British influence which was entirely anti-national,\r\nand was thus constrained to seek for strength in the principle of\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nSelfishness is a rooted principle of action in nations not less than in\r\nsingle persons. It seems to draw a certain perfume from the virtue of\r\npatriotism, which lies upon its borders. It stalks abroad with a\r\nsemblance of decency, nay, even of excellence. And under this cover a\r\nparamount community readily embraces the notion, that a dependent\r\ncommunity may be made to exist not for its own sake, but for the sake of\r\nan extraneous society of men. With this idea, the European nations,\r\nutterly benighted in comparison with the ancient Greeks, founded their\r\ntransmarine dependencies. But a vast maritime distance, perhaps aided by\r\nsome filtration of sound ideas, prevented the application of this theory\r\nin its nakedness and rigour to the American Colonies of England. In\r\nIreland we had not even the title of founders to allege. Nay, we were,\r\nin point of indigenous civilization, the junior people. But the maritime\r\nseverance, sufficient to prevent accurate and familiar knowledge, was\r\nnot enough to bar the effective exercise of overmastering power. And\r\npower was exercised, at first from without, to support the Pale, to\r\nenlarge it, to make it include Ireland. When this had been done, power\r\nbegan, in the seventeenth century, to be exercised from within Ireland,\r\nwithin the precinct of its government and its institutions. These were\r\ncarefully corrupted, from the multiplication of the Boroughs by James I.\r\nonwards, for the purpose. The struggle became civil, instead of martial;\r\nand it was mainly waged by agencies on the spot, not from beyond the\r\nChannel. When the rule of England passed over from the old violence into\r\nlegal forms and doctrines, the Irish reaction against it followed the\r\nexample. And the legal idea of Irish nationality took its rise in very\r\nhumble surroundings; if the expression may be allowed, it was born in\r\nthe slums of politics. Ireland reached the nadir of political depression\r\nwhen, at and after the Boyne, she had been conquered not merely by an\r\nEnglish force, but by continental mercenaries. The ascendant\r\nProtestantism of the island had never stood so low in the aspect it\r\npresented to this country; inasmuch as the Irish Parliament, for the\r\nfirst time, I believe, declared itself dependent upon England,[76] and\r\neither did not desire, or did not dare, to support its champion\r\nMolyneux, when his work asserting Irish independence was burned in\r\nLondon. It petitioned for representation in the English Parliament, not\r\nin order to uplift the Irish people, but in order to keep them down. In\r\nits sympathies and in its aims the overwhelming mass of the population\r\nhad no share. It was Swift who, by the _Drapier's Letters_, for the\r\nfirst time called into existence a public opinion flowing from and\r\nrepresenting Ireland as a whole. He reasserted the doctrine of Molyneux,\r\nand denounced Wood's halfpence not only as a foul robbery, but as a\r\nconstitutional and as a national insult. The patience of the Irish\r\nProtestants was tried very hard, and they were forced, as Sir Charles\r\nDuffy states in his vivid book, to purchase the power of oppressing\r\ntheir Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen at a great price.[77] Their\r\npension list was made to provide the grants too degrading to be\r\ntolerated in England. The Presbyterians had to sit down under the\r\nEpiscopal monopoly; but the enjoyment of that monopoly was not left to\r\nthe Irish Episcopalians. In the time of Henry VIII. it had been\r\nnecessary to import an English Archbishop Browne[78] and an English\r\nBishop Bale, or there might not have been a single Protestant in\r\nIreland. It was well to enrich the rolls of the Church of Ireland with\r\nthe piety and learning of Ussher, and to give her in Bedell one name, at\r\nleast, which carries the double crown of the hero and the saint. But,\r\nafter the Restoration, by degrees the practice degenerated, and\r\nEnglishmen were appointed in numbers to the Irish Episcopate in order to\r\nfortify and develop by numerical force what came to be familiarly known\r\nas the English interest. So that the Primate Boulter, during his\r\ngovernment of Ireland, complains[79] that Englishmen are still less than\r\none-half the whole body of Bishops, although the most important sees\r\nwere to a large extent in their hands. The same practice was followed in\r\nthe higher judicial offices. Fitzgibbon was the first Irishman who\r\nbecame Lord Chancellor.[80] The Viceroy, commonly absent, was\r\nrepresented by Lords Justices, who again were commonly English; and\r\nPrimate Boulter, a most acute and able man, jealous of an Irish Speaker\r\nin that character, recommends that the commander of the forces should\r\ntake his place.[81] When, later on, the Viceroy resided, it was a rule\r\nthat the Chief Secretary should be an Englishman. On the occasion when\r\nLord Castlereagh was by way of exception admitted to that office, an\r\napology was found for it in his entire devotion to English policy and\r\npurposes. \"His appointment,\" says Lord Cornwallis, \"gives me great\r\nsatisfaction, as he is so very unlike an Irishman!\"[82] Resources were\r\nalso found in the military profession, and among the voters for the\r\nUnion we find the names of eight[83] English generals.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements under Poynings's Law, and the commercial proscription,\r\ndrove the iron ever deeper and deeper into the souls of Irishmen. It is\r\nbut small merit in the Irish Parliament of George I. and George II., if\r\nunder these circumstances a temper was gradually formed in, and\r\ntransmitted by, them, which might one day achieve the honours of\r\npatriotism. It was in dread of this most healthful process, that the\r\nEnglish Government set sedulously to work for its repression. The odious\r\npolicy was maintained by a variety of agencies; by the misuse of Irish\r\nrevenue, a large portion of which was unhappily under their control; by\r\nmaintaining the duration of the Irish House of Commons for the life of\r\nthe Sovereign; and, worst of all, by extending the range of corruption\r\nwithin the walls, through the constant multiplication of paid offices\r\ntenable by members of Parliament without even the check of re-election\r\non acceptance.\r\n\r\nThus by degrees those who sat in the Irish Houses came to feel both that\r\nthey had a country, and that their country had claims upon them. The\r\ngrowth of a commercial interest in the Roman Catholic body must have\r\naccelerated the growth of this idea, as that interest naturally fell\r\ninto line with the resistance to the English prescriptive laws. But the\r\nrate of progress was fearfully slow. It was hemmed in on every side by\r\nthe obstinate unyielding pressure of selfish interests: the interest of\r\nthe Established Church against the Presbyterians; the interest of the\r\nProtestant laity, or tithe-payers, against the clergy; the bold\r\nunscrupulous interest of a landlords' Parliament against the occupier of\r\nthe soil; which, together with the grievance of the system of\r\ntithe-proctors, established in Ireland through the Whiteboys the fatal\r\nalliance between resistance to wrong and resistance to law, and supplied\r\nthere the yet more disastrous facility of sustaining and enforcing wrong\r\nunder the name of giving support to public tranquillity. Yet, forcing on\r\nits way amidst all these difficulties by a natural law, in a strange\r\nhaphazard and disjointed method, and by a zigzag movement, there came\r\ninto existence, and by degrees into steady operation, a sentiment native\r\nto Ireland and having Ireland for its vital basis, and yet not deserving\r\nthe name of Irish patriotism, because its care was not for a nation, but\r\nfor a sect. For a sect, in a stricter sense than may at first sight be\r\nsupposed. The battle was not between Popery and a generalized\r\nProtestantism, though, even if it had been so, it would have been\r\nbetween a small minority and the vast majority of the Irish people. It\r\nwas not a party of ascendency, but a party of monopoly, that ruled. It\r\nmust always be borne in mind that the Roman Catholic aristocracy had\r\nbeen emasculated, and reduced to the lowest point of numerical and moral\r\nforce by the odious action of the penal laws, and that the mass of the\r\nRoman Catholic population, clerical and lay, remained under the grinding\r\nforce of many-sided oppression, and until long after the accession of\r\nGeorge III. had scarcely a consciousness of political existence. As long\r\nas the great bulk of the nation could be equated to zero, the Episcopal\r\nmonopolists had no motive for cultivating the good-will of the\r\nPresbyterians, who like the Roman Catholics maintained their religion,\r\nwith the trivial exception of the _Regium Donum_, by their own\r\nresources, and who differed from them in being not persecuted, but only\r\ndisabled. And this monopoly, which drew from the sacred name of religion\r\nits title to exist, offered through centuries an example of religious\r\nsterility to which a parallel can hardly be found among the communions\r\nof the Christian world. The sentiment, then, which animated the earlier\r\nefforts of the Parliament might be _Iricism_, but did not become\r\npatriotism until it had outgrown, and had learned to forswear or to\r\nforget, the conditions of its infancy. Neither did it for a long time\r\nacquire the courage of its opinions; for, when Lucas, in the middle of\r\nthe century, reasserted the doctrine of Molyneux and of Swift, the Grand\r\nJury of Dublin took part against him, and burned his book.[84] And the\r\nParliament,[85] prompted by the Government, drove him into exile. And\r\nyet the smoke showed that there was fire. The infant, that confronted\r\nthe British Government in the Parliament House, had something of the\r\nyoung Hercules about him. In the first exercises of strength he acquired\r\nmore strength, and in acquiring more strength he burst the bonds that\r\nhad confined him.\r\n\r\n    \"Es machte mir zu eng, ich mussie fort.\"[86]\r\n\r\nThe reign of George IV. began with resolute efforts of the Parliament\r\nnot to lengthen, as in England under his grandfather, but to shorten its\r\nown commission, and to become septennial. Surely this was a noble\r\neffort. It meant the greatness of their country, and it meant also\r\npersonal self-sacrifice. The Parliament which then existed, elected\r\nunder a youth of twenty-two, had every likelihood of giving to the bulk\r\nof its members a seat for life. This they asked to change for a\r\n_maximum_ term of seven years. This from session to session, in spite of\r\nrejection after rejection in England, they resolutely fought to obtain.\r\nIt was an English amendment which, on a doubtful pretext; changed seven\r\nyears to eight. Without question some acted under the pressure of\r\nconstituents; but only a minority of the members had constituents, and\r\npopular exigencies from such a quarter might have been bought off by an\r\noccasional vote, and could not have induced a war with the Executive and\r\nwith England so steadily continued, unless a higher principle had been\r\nat work.\r\n\r\nThe triumph came at last; and from 1768 onwards the Commons never wholly\r\nrelapsed into their former quiescence. True, this was for a Protestant\r\nHouse, constituency, and nation; but ere long they began to enlarge\r\ntheir definition of nationality. Flood and Lucas, the commanders in the\r\nreal battle, did not dream of giving the Roman Catholics a political\r\nexistence, but to their own constituents they performed an honourable\r\nservice and gave a great boon. Those, who had insincerely supported the\r\nmeasure, became the dupes of their own insincerity. In the very year of\r\nthis victory, a Bill for a slight relaxation of the penal laws was\r\npassed, but met its death in England.[87] Other Bills followed, and one\r\nof them became an Act in 1771. A beginning had thus been made on behalf\r\nof religious liberty, as a corollary to political emancipation. It was\r\nlike a little ray of light piercing its way through the rocks into a\r\ncavern and supplying the prisoner at once with guidance and with hope.\r\nResolute action, in withholding or shortening supply, convinced the\r\nExecutive in Dublin, and the Ministry in London, that serious business\r\nwas intended. And it appeared, even in this early stage, how necessary\r\nit was for a fruitful campaign on their own behalf to enlarge their\r\nbasis, and enlist the sympathies of hitherto excluded fellow-subjects.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that the first beginnings of successful endeavour\r\nshould have been made on behalf not of the \"common Protestantism,\" but\r\nof Roman Catholics. But, as Mr. Lecky has shown, the Presbyterians had\r\nbeen greatly depressed and distracted, while the Roman Catholics had now\r\na strong position in the commerce of the country, and in Dublin\r\nknocked, as it were, at the very doors of the Parliament. There may also\r\nhave been an apprehension of republican sentiments among the Protestants\r\nof the north, from which the Roman Catholics were known to be free. Not\r\nmany years, however, passed before the softening and harmonizing\r\neffects, which naturally flow from a struggle for liberty, warmed the\r\nsentiment of the House in favour of the Presbyterians.\r\n\r\nA Bill was passed by the Irish Parliament in 1778, which greatly\r\nmitigated the stringency of the penal laws. Moreover, in its preamble\r\nwas recited, as a ground for this legislation, that for \"a long series\r\nof years\" the Roman Catholics had exhibited an \"uniform peaceable\r\nbehaviour.\" In doing and saying so much, the Irish Parliament virtually\r\nbound itself to do more.[88] In this Bill was contained a clause which\r\nrepealed the Sacramental Test, and thereby liberated the Presbyterians\r\nfrom disqualification. But the Bill had to pass the ordeal of a review\r\nin England, and there the clause was struck out. The Bill itself, though\r\nmutilated, was wisely passed by a majority of 127 to 89. Even in this\r\nform it excited the enthusiastic admiration of Burke.[89] Nor were the\r\nPresbyterians forgotten at the epoch when, in 1779-80, England, under\r\nthe pressure of her growing difficulties, made large commercial\r\nconcessions to Ireland. The Dublin Parliament renewed the Bill for the\r\nremoval of the Sacramental Test. And it was carried by the Irish\r\nParliament in the very year which witnessed in London the disgraceful\r\nriots of Lord George Gordon, and forty-eight years before the Imperial\r\nParliament conceded, on this side the Channel, any similar relief. Other\r\ncontemporary signs bore witness to the growth of toleration; for the\r\nVolunteers, founded in 1778, and originally a Protestant body, after a\r\ntime received Roman Catholics into their ranks. These impartial\r\nproceedings are all the more honourable to Irish sentiment in general,\r\nbecause Lord Charlemont, its champion out of doors, and Flood, long the\r\nleader of the Independent party in the Parliament, were neither of them\r\nprepared to surrender the system of Protestant ascendency.\r\n\r\nIn order to measure the space which had at this period been covered by\r\nthe forward movement of liberality and patriotism, it is necessary to\r\nlook back to the early years of the Georgian period, when Whiggism had\r\nacquired a decisive ascendency, and the spirits of the great deep were\r\nlet loose against Popery. But the temper of proscription in the two\r\ncountries exhibited specific differences. Extravagant in both, it became\r\nin Ireland vulgar and indecent. In England, it was Tilburina,[90] gone\r\nmad in white satin; in Ireland it was Tilburina's maid, gone mad in\r\nwhite linen. The Lords Justices of Ireland, in 1715, recommended the\r\nParliament to put an end to all other distinctions in Ireland \"but that\r\nof Protestant and Papist.\"[91] And the years that followed seem to mark\r\nthe lowest point of constitutional depression for the Roman Catholic\r\npopulation in particular, as well as for Ireland at large. The Commons,\r\nin 1715, prayed for measures to discover any Papist enlisting in the\r\nKing's service, in order that he might be expelled \"and punished with\r\nthe utmost severity of the law.\"[92] When an oath of abjuration had been\r\nimposed which prevented nearly all priests from registering, a Bill was\r\npassed by the Commons in 1719 for branding the letter P on the cheek of\r\nall priests, who were unregistered, with a red-hot iron. The Privy\r\nCouncil \"disliked\" this punishment, and substituted for it the loathsome\r\nmeasure by which safe guardians are secured for Eastern harems. The\r\nEnglish Government could not stomach this beastly proposal; and, says\r\nMr. Lecky,[93] unanimously restored the punishment of branding. The\r\nBill was finally lost in Ireland, but only owing to a clause concerning\r\nleases. It had gone to England winged with a prayer from the Commons\r\nthat it might be recommended \"in the most effectual manner to his\r\nMajesty,\" and by the assurance of the Viceroy in reply that they might\r\ndepend on his due regard to what was desired.[94] In the same year\r\npassed the Act which declared the title of the British Parliament to\r\nmake laws for the government of Ireland. On the accession of George II.,\r\na considerable body of Roman Catholics offered an address of\r\ncongratulation. It was received by the Lords Justices with silent\r\ncontempt, and no one knows whether it ever reached its destination.\r\nFinally, the acute state-craft of Primate Boulter resisted habitually\r\nthe creation of an \"Irish interest,\" and above all any capacity of the\r\nRoman Catholics to contribute to its formation; and in the first year of\r\nGeorge II. a clause was introduced in committee into a harmless Bill[95]\r\nfor the regulation of elections, which disfranchised at a single stroke\r\nall the Roman Catholic voters in Ireland who up to that period had\r\nalways enjoyed the franchise.\r\n\r\nIt is painful to record the fact that the remarkable progress gradually\r\nachieved was in no way due to British influence. For nearly forty years\r\nfrom the arrival of Archbishop Boulter in Ireland, the government of\r\nIreland was in the hands of the Primates. The harshness of\r\nadministration was gradually tempered, especially in the brief\r\nviceroyalty of Lord Chesterfield; but the British policy was steadily\r\nopposed to the enlargement of Parliamentary privilege, or the creation\r\nof any Irish interest, however narrow its basis, while the political\r\nextinction of the mass of the people was complete. The pecuniary wants,\r\nhowever, of the Government, extending beyond the hereditary revenue,\r\nrequired a resort to the national purse. The demands which were\r\naccordingly made, and these alone, supplied the Parliament with a\r\nvantage-ground, and a principle of life. The action of this principle\r\nbrought with it civilizing and humanizing influences, which had become\r\nclearly visible in the early years of George III., and which were\r\ncherished by the war of American Independence, as by a strong current of\r\nfresh air in a close and murky dungeon.\r\n\r\nThe force of principles, and the significance of political achievements,\r\nis to be estimated in no small degree by the slenderness of the means\r\navailable to those who promote them. And the progress brought about in\r\nthe Irish Parliament is among the most remarkable on record, because it\r\nwas effected against the joint resistance of a hostile Executive and of\r\nan intolerable constitution. Of the three hundred members, about\r\ntwo-thirds were nominated by individual patrons and by close\r\ncorporations. What was still worse, the action of the Executive was\r\nincreasingly directed, as the pulse of the national life came to beat\r\nmore vigorously, to the systematic corruption of the Parliament borough\r\npensions and paid offices. In the latter part of the century, more than\r\none-third of the members of Parliament were dismissible at pleasure from\r\npublic emoluments. If the base influence of the Executive allied itself\r\nwith the patriotic party, everything might be hoped. For we must bear in\r\nmind not only the direct influence of this expenditure on those who were\r\nin possession, but the enormous power of expectancy on those who were\r\nnot. Conversely, when the Government were determined to do wrong, there\r\nwere no means commonly available of forcing it to do right, in any\r\nmatter that touched either religious bigotry or selfish interest. With\r\nso miserable an apparatus, and in the face of the ever-wakeful Executive\r\nsustained by British power, it is rather wonderful how much than how\r\nlittle was effected. I am not aware of a single case in which a measure\r\non behalf of freedom was proposed by British agency, and rejected by\r\nthe Irish Parliament. On the other hand, we have a long list of the\r\nachievements of that Parliament due to a courage and perseverance which\r\nfaced and overcame a persistent English opposition. Among other\r\nexploits, it established periodical elections, obtained the writ of\r\nHabeas Corpus, carried the independence of the judges, repealed the Test\r\nAct, limited the abominable expenditure on pensions, subjected the\r\nacceptance of office from the crown to the condition of re-election, and\r\nachieved, doubtless with the powerful aid of the volunteers, freedom of\r\ntrade with England, and the repeal of Poynings's Act, and of the British\r\nAct of 1719.[96]\r\n\r\nAll this it did without the manifestation, either within the walls or\r\namong the Roman Catholic population, of any disposition to weaken the\r\nties which bound Ireland to the empire. All this it did; and what had\r\nthe British Parliament been about during the same period, with its\r\nvastly greater means both of self-defence and of action? It had been\r\nbuilding up the atrocious criminal code, tampering in the case of Wilkes\r\nwith liberty of election, and tampering with many other liberties;\r\ndriving, too, the American Colonies into rebellion, while, as to good\r\nlegislation, the century is almost absolutely blank, until between 1782\r\nand 1793 we have the establishment of Irish freedom, the economical\r\nreform of Mr. Burke, the financial reforms of Mr. Pitt, the new libel\r\nlaw of Mr. Fox, and the legislative constitution of Canada, in which\r\nboth these great statesmen concurred.\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet reached the climax of Irish advancement. When, in\r\n1782 and 1783, the legislative relations of the two countries were\r\nfundamentally rectified by the formal acknowledgment of Irish\r\nnationality, the beginning of a great work was accomplished; but its\r\nfinal consummation, though rendered practicable and even easy, depended\r\nwholly on the continuing good intention of the British Cabinet. The\r\nActs of 1782 and 1783 required a supplemental arrangement, to obviate\r\nthose secondary difficulties in the working of the two Legislatures,\r\nwhich supplied Mr. Pitt with his main parliamentary plea for the Union.\r\nWhat was yet more important was the completion of the scheme in Ireland\r\nitself. And this under three great heads: (1) The purification of\r\nParliament by a large measure of reform; (2) the abolition of all Roman\r\nCatholic disabilities; (3) the establishment of a proper relation\r\nbetween the Legislative and the Executive powers. It is often urged,\r\nwith cynical disregard to justice and reason, that with the Grattan\r\nParliament we had corruption, coercion, discontent, and finally\r\nrebellion. But the political mischiefs, which disfigure the brief life\r\nof the Grattan Parliament, and the failure to obtain the two first of\r\nthe three great purposes I have named, were all in the main due to the\r\nthird grand flaw in the Irish case after 1782. I mean the false\r\nposition, and usually mischievous character, of the Irish Executive,\r\nwhich, with its army of placemen and expectants in Parliament, was\r\ncommonly absolute master of the situation. Well does Mr. Swift\r\nMacNeill,[97] in his very useful work, quote the words of Mr. Fox in\r\n1797: \"The advantages, which the form of a free Government seemed to\r\npromise, have been counteracted by the influence of the Executive\r\nGovernment, and of the British Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\nThere were five Viceroys between 1782 and 1790. Then came a sixth, Lord\r\nWestmoreland, the worst of them all, whose political judgment was on a\r\npar with his knowledge of the English language.[98] The great settlement\r\nof 1782-3 was in the main worked by men who were radically adverse to\r\nits spirit and intention. But they were omnipotent in their control of\r\nthe unreformed. Parliament of Ireland, more and more drenched, under\r\ntheir unceasing and pestilent activity, with fresh doses of corruption.\r\nWestmoreland and his myrmidons actually persuaded Pitt, in 1792, that\r\nIrish Protestantism and its Parliament were unconquerably adverse to the\r\nadmission of Roman Catholics to the franchise; but when the proposal was\r\nmade from the Throne in 1793, notwithstanding the latent hostility of\r\nthe Castle, the Parliament passed the Bill with little delay, and\r\n\"without any serious opposition.\"[99] The votes against it were one and\r\nthree on two divisions[100] respectively. A minority of sixty-nine\r\nsupported, against the Government, a clause for extending the measure to\r\nseats in Parliament. That clause, lost by a majority of ninety-four,\r\nmight apparently have been carried, but for \"Dublin Castle,\" by an even\r\nlarger majority.\r\n\r\nI shall not here examine the interesting question, whether the mission\r\nof Lord Fitzwilliam was wholly due to the action of those Whig statesmen\r\nwho were friendly to the war, but disinclined to a junction with Mr.\r\nPitt except on condition of a fundamental change in the administration\r\nof Ireland. Nor shall I dwell upon his sudden, swift, and disastrous\r\nrecall. But I purpose here to invite attention to the most remarkable\r\nfact in the whole history of the Irish Parliament. When the Viceroy's\r\ndoom was known, when the return to the policy and party of ascendency\r\nlay darkly lowering in the immediate future, this diminutive and tainted\r\nIrish Parliament, with a chivalry rare even in the noblest histories,\r\nmade what can hardly be called less than a bold attempt to arrest the\r\npolicy of retrogression adopted by the Government in London. Lord\r\nFitzwilliam was the declared friend of Roman Catholic Emancipation,\r\nwhich was certain to be followed by reform; and he had struck a\r\ndeath-blow at bigotry and monopoly in the person of their heads, Mr.\r\nBeresford and Mr. Cooke. The Bill of Emancipation was introduced on the\r\n12th of February,[101] with only three dissentient voices. On the 14th,\r\nwhen the London Cabinet had declared dissent from the proceedings of\r\ntheir Viceroy without recalling him, Sir L. Parsons at once moved an\r\naddress, imploring him to continue among them, and only postponed it at\r\nthe friendly request of Mr. Ponsonby.[102] On the 2nd of March, when the\r\nrecall was a fact, the House voted that Lord Fitzwilliam merited \"the\r\nthanks of that House, and the confidence of the people.\"[103] On the 5th\r\nthe Duke of Leinster moved, and the House of Peers carried, a similar\r\nresolution.[104]\r\n\r\nAt this epoch I pause. Here there opens a new and disastrous drama of\r\ndisgrace to England and misery to Ireland. This is the point at which we\r\nmay best learn the second and the greatest lesson taught by the history\r\nof Ireland in the eighteenth century. It is this, that, awful as is the\r\nforce of bigotry, hidden under the mask of religion, but fighting for\r\nplunder and for power with all the advantages of possession, of\r\nprescription, and of extraneous support, there is a David that can kill\r\nthis Goliath. That conquering force lies in the principle of\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nIt was the growing sense of nationality that prompted the Irish\r\nParliament to develop its earlier struggles for privilege on the narrow\r\nground into a genuine contest for freedom, civil and religious, on a\r\nground as broad as Ireland, nay, as humanity at large. If there be such\r\nthings as contradictions in the world of politics, they are to be found\r\nin nationality on the one side, and bigotry of all kinds on the other,\r\nbut especially religious bigotry, which is of all the most baneful.\r\nWhatever is given to the first of these two is lost to the second. I\r\nspeak of a reasonable and reasoning, not of a blind and headstrong\r\nnationality; of a nationality which has regard to circumstances and to\r\ntraditions, and which only requires that all relations, of incorporation\r\nor of independence, shall be adjusted to them according to the laws of\r\nNature's own enactment. Such a nationality was the growth of the last\r\ncentury in Ireland. As each Irishman began to feel that he had a\r\ncountry, to which he belonged, and which belonged to him, he was, by a\r\ntrue process of nature, drawn more and more into brotherhood, and into\r\nthe sense of brotherhood, with those who shared the allegiance and the\r\nproperty, the obligation and the heritage. And this idea of country,\r\nonce well conceived, presents itself as a very large idea, and as a\r\nframework for most other ideas, so as to supply the basis of a common\r\nlife. Hence it was that, on the coming of Lord Fitzwilliam, the whole\r\ngenerous emotion of the country leapt up with one consent, and went\r\nforth to meet him. Hence it was that religious bigotry was no longer an\r\nappreciable factor in the public life of Ireland. Hence it was that on\r\nhis recall, and in order to induce acquiescence in his recall, it became\r\nnecessary to divide again the host that had, welcomed him--to put one\r\npart of it in array as Orangemen, who were to be pampered and inflamed;\r\nand to quicken the self-consciousness of another and larger mass by\r\nrepulsion and proscription, by stripping Roman Catholics of arms in the\r\nface of licence and of cruelty, and, finally, by clothing the extreme of\r\nlawlessness with the forms of law.\r\n\r\nWithin the last twelve months we have seen, in the streets of Belfast,\r\nthe painful proof that the work of Beresford and of Castlereagh has been\r\nfound capable for the moment of revival. To aggravate or sustain Irish\r\ndisunion, religious bigotry has been again evoked in Ireland. If the\r\ncurse be an old one, there is also an old cure, recorded in the grand\r\npharmacopoeia of history; and if the abstract force of policy and\r\nprudence are insufficient for the work, we may yet find that the evil\r\nspirit will be effectually laid by the gentle influence of a living and\r\nworking Irish nationality. _Quod faxit Deus._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: _2 Henry VI._, act iii. sc. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Lecky's _History of England in the Eighteenth Century_,\r\nchap, vii. vol. ii, p. 205.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Lecky's _History of England in the Eighteenth Century_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 227.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Duffy's _Bird's-Eye View_, p. 164.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: Duffy's _Bird's-Eye View_, p. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: See Ball's _History of the Church of Ireland_, a valuable\r\nwork, deserving of more attention than it seems to have received.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Boulter's _Letters_, i. 138, _et alibi_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Lecky's _History of England in the Eighteenth Century_,\r\nii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Boulter's _Letters_, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Cornwallis's _Correspondence_, ii. 441.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Grattan's _Life and Times_, v. 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Lecky, ii. 430.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Duffy, p. 177.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Schiller's _Wallenstein_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Lecky, iv. 489.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Lecky, iv. 477-479; Brown, _Laws against Catholics_, pp.\r\n329-332.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Lecky, pp. 499-501.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Sheridan's _Critic_, act iii. sc.
