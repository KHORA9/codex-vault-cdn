In this rapid and\r\noriginal survey the true proportions of civic history in our national\r\nlife are boldly drawn; and the burghers and shopkeepers of the towns,\r\nlong neglected and despised, take their place in the distinguished\r\nranks of those by whom our freedom has been won by their sturdy battle\r\nagainst oppression, leading the way in the growth and elevation of\r\nthe English people, and carrying across the ages of tyranny the full\r\ntradition of liberty. But the history of this great civic revolution,\r\nwhich in Mr. Green’s day cannot be said to have existed at all, has\r\nsince then remained strangely neglected among us. While in foreign\r\ncountries the study of the origin and growth of municipal institutions\r\nhas been recognized as of overwhelming importance, and has already\r\nemployed the erudition and tried the ingenuity of a long succession\r\nof scholars, English historians have stood aloof. No English name\r\nfigures in the contests of the schools; nor is any English authority\r\ncalled to witness when a learned theory is advanced to solve the\r\nriddle; and if from time to time foreign scholars attempt to draw\r\nEnglish towns within the range of their generalizations, the lack of\r\nsufficient or trustworthy materials at their disposal makes the result\r\nvain and unfruitful. No country indeed has been so backward as our\r\nown in municipal history, whether we take it from the popular or from\r\nthe scientific side. The traveller who has asked at the bookshop of a\r\nprovincial town for a local history or even for a local guide is as\r\nwell able to realize the distance which parts us from France, Italy,\r\nor Germany, as is the student who inquires for a detailed account of\r\nhow civic life or any one of its characteristic institutions grew up\r\namong us. A certain number of town histories do indeed exist, but\r\nthey by no means always deal necessarily or even mainly with the life\r\nof the borough itself. To a considerable number of local antiquaries\r\nthe buried relics of the Roman dominion have proved a permanent and\r\npre-occupying interest. For the student of mediæval times the monastery\r\nand cathedral tower high above the squalid market-place and thatched\r\ntown-hall which lie dwarfed and obscured under their vast shadow; and\r\nin modern as in older history the butchers and brewers who represent\r\nthe secular corporations of York and Winchester are practically bid\r\nto stand aside before the presence of the spiritual corporations\r\nto whom the fame of S. Mary’s or S. Swithun’s is committed. Where\r\necclesiastical monuments of historic greatness are wanting, a fervent\r\napologist may still find an excuse for the meanness and dulness of the\r\nmunicipal story, in the fact that at some time or other the town has\r\nlent its streets to serve as the stage for a critical scene in the\r\nnational drama, and thus—through the lifting of a royal standard, or\r\nthe tragedy of a conspicuous adventurer—derives a borrowed title to\r\nour interest. That the story of convent and chapter and solemn pageant\r\nshould be told with full detail I do not question. I only urge that\r\nwhen the tale is finished we still wait for some notice of the city\r\nitself and the humble details of its common life. There are, it is\r\ntrue, signs of increasing interest in such matters, and some admirable\r\nstudies in our municipal records have lately been made in England;\r\nnevertheless the work is still at its beginning, and how much need\r\nthere is for further study I have had occasion to know in the course of\r\nan attempt to trace the developement of some forty or fifty provincial\r\nboroughs, so as to gain some idea of the condition of our mediæval\r\ntowns, and the general drift of their history. The preparatory work\r\nwhich the foreign student finds already finished and organized for his\r\nuse, the English worker has in almost every case to do for himself.\r\nEven the briefest sketch of a town history too often implies the long\r\nlabour of seeking out a mass of scattered and isolated details, which\r\nmust first be drawn together into some connected sequence before it is\r\npossible to study the general bearing and significance of the story\r\nin relation to the growth of neighbouring boroughs. Those who have\r\nattempted to find their way through the uncertainty and confusion of\r\nthe materials as they at present exist, will probably be the most\r\nlenient judges of inevitable errors of detail such as must creep into\r\nthe performance of so delicate and difficult a task.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, indeed, from the nature of the subject, that any\r\nwriter who desires to give a survey of provincial town life as we\r\ncan now picture it—from printed materials scattered in county\r\nhistories, archæological journals, reports of commissions, imperfect\r\nabstracts of town documents, parliamentary records, charters, and\r\nstray pamphlets—must inevitably remain exposed to much correction in\r\nmatters of detail from experts with local knowledge. At the same time\r\nit seems to me that without some effort to obtain a comprehensive view\r\nof the general subject, the student may leave himself open to the still\r\ngraver errors that spring from the want of some ascertained measure\r\nof proportion, and from the incapacity to distinguish in each town\r\nthat which is normal from that which is strange or characteristic.\r\nThe question of origins I have deliberately set on one side, from the\r\nconviction that the beginnings of a society may be more fruitfully\r\nstudied after we know something of its actual life. Avoiding therefore\r\nmany dark questions, I have dealt in the first volume rather with the\r\nsimpler and less contentious aspects of the growth of the borough to\r\nwealth and independence. In the second volume, however, the subjects\r\nwhich arise have long been familiar as matters of acute discussion;\r\nand it has sometimes happened, that in going over again the sources\r\nfrom which all our knowledge is derived, I have found myself gradually\r\ncompelled to entertain views contrary to those which are commonly\r\naccepted. Thus, for example, in tracing the growth of self-government\r\nwithin the borough itself, I seem to discover in the phrazes of the\r\ntown records a new explanation for the position of the “communitas”\r\nside by side with the “cives”—a problem which, so far as I know, has\r\nnever been really stated, and the difficulties of which are in no way\r\nmet by the universally received interpretation. Moreover the theory\r\nof an early triumph and rapid decay of democratic government appears\r\nto me impossible to maintain, and I have suggested that in the growth\r\nof the common council we may find some evidence of a popular movement\r\ntowards more effectual self-government which seems to have stirred the\r\nindustrial classes of the fifteenth century. There are other burning\r\nquestions in which impetuous economists have outrun the historians, and\r\nhave not found it premature to set in order by the help of accepted\r\ntheories the obscure chaos of social history in the Middle Ages. In\r\nspite of their zealous efforts, however, the whole problem (including\r\neven the ascertaining of the facts on which it depends) of the\r\ndevelopement of English commerce and manufactures and of its effects on\r\nsocial life, still awaits the student; and it is in the confusion and\r\nignorance which at present prevail, that I may find my best excuse for\r\nthe fact that with regard to many questions—such, for instance, as the\r\nrelation of internal traffic to free trade and protection, the general\r\norganization of labour, the position of the guild towards the hired\r\nworker, the attitude of the municipality to the industrial system, and\r\nof the capitalist to the town councillor—I have ventured to differ\r\nfrom conclusions which are commonly put forward.\r\n\r\nI would add but one word of personal explanation before I close. The\r\nonly training or guidance which I have ever had in historical work was\r\nin a very brief period during which I was able to watch the method and\r\nunderstand the temper in which Mr. Green’s work was done. I never had\r\nthe opportunity of visiting any English towns with him, or of following\r\nhis studies in that direction. The most fruitful lesson which remains\r\nin my memory is that of a day spent in Ancona between two stages of an\r\ninvalid journey, when I was able to see the intense enthusiasm with\r\nwhich, as was his habit, he made his way first to the Town-hall, and\r\nfrom the fragments of Greek and mediæval carving built into its walls,\r\nfrom harbour and pier, from names of streets, and the cathedral crypt,\r\nhe extracted century by century some record of the old municipal life.\r\nIt was doubtless some such remembrance as this that unconsciously\r\nled me in the course of reading, to turn to the story of the English\r\nboroughs. At the same time I have no doubt that I should always have\r\nbeen restrained from any idea of writing by my consciousness of the\r\nentire lack of adequate preparation for such a task, if I had not felt\r\nbound by an imperative obligation to make the attempt. When Mr. Green’s\r\nwork was over he asked of me a promise that I would try to study some\r\nof those problems in mediæval history where there seemed to him so much\r\nthat still needed to be done, and so much to be yet discovered. In\r\nthis book I have made my first beginning toward the fulfilling of that\r\npromise. Such a work can only be closed with feelings of compunction\r\nand dismay.\r\n\r\n  ALICE STOPFORD GREEN.\r\n\r\n  14, KENSINGTON SQUARE,\r\n  _March, 1894_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                                                        PAGE\r\n\r\n  THE ENGLISH TOWNS                                        1\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY      35\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  THE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY      75\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  THE COMMON LIFE OF THE TOWN                            124\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  THE TOWNSPEOPLE                                        169\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  THE PROBLEM OF GOVERNMENT                              197\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  BATTLE FOR FREEDOM (TOWNS ON ROYAL DEMESNE)            226\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  BATTLE FOR FREEDOM (TOWNS ON FEUDAL ESTATES)           250\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  BATTLE FOR FREEDOM (TOWNS ON CHURCH ESTATES)           277\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  BATTLE FOR SUPREMACY                                   309\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  THE TOWNS AND THE CHURCH                               333\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  CONFEDERATION                                          384\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TOWN LIFE\r\n\r\n                                  IN\r\n\r\n                         THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH TOWNS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is nothing in England to-day with which we can compare the\r\nlife of a fully enfranchised borough of the fifteenth century. Even\r\nthe revival of our local institutions and our municipal ambition has\r\nscarcely stirred any memory of the great tradition of the past, of the\r\nlarge liberties, the high dignities and privileges which our towns\r\nclaimed in days when the borough was in fact a free self-governing\r\ncommunity, a state within the state, boasting of rights derived from\r\nimmemorial custom and of later privileges assured by law.\r\n\r\nThe town of those earlier days in fact governed itself after the\r\nfashion of a little principality. Within the bounds which the\r\nmayor and citizens defined with perpetual insistence in their\r\nformal perambulation year after year it carried on its isolated\r\nself-dependent life. The inhabitants defended their own territory,\r\nbuilt and maintained their walls and towers, armed their own soldiers,\r\ntrained them for service, and held reviews of their forces at appointed\r\ntimes. They elected their own rulers and officials in whatever way\r\nthey themselves chose to adopt, and distributed among officers and\r\ncouncillors just such powers of legislation and administration as\r\nseemed good in their eyes. They drew up formal constitutions for the\r\ngovernment of the community, and as time brought new problems and\r\nresponsibilities, made and re-made and revised again their ordinances\r\nwith restless and fertile ingenuity, till they had made of their\r\nconstitution a various medley of fundamental doctrines and general\r\nprecepts and particular rules, somewhat after the fashion of an\r\nAmerican state of modern times. No alien officer of any kind, save\r\nonly the judges of the High Court, might cross the limits of their\r\nliberties; the sheriff of the shire, the bailiff of the hundred, the\r\nking’s tax-gatherer or sergeant-at-arms, were alike shut out. The\r\ntownsfolk themselves assessed their taxes, levied them in their own\r\nway, and paid them through their own officers. They claimed broad\r\nrights of justice, whether by ancient custom or royal grant; criminals\r\nwere brought before the mayor’s court, and the town prison with its\r\nirons and its cage, the gallows at the gate or on the town common,\r\ntestified to an authority which ended only with death.[1] In all\r\nconcerns of trade they exercised the widest powers, and bargained and\r\nnegotiated and made laws as nations do on a grander scale to-day. They\r\ncould covenant and confederate, buy and sell, deal and traffic after\r\ntheir own will; they could draw up formal treaties with other boroughs,\r\nand could admit them to or shut them out from all the privileges of\r\ntheir commerce; they might pass laws of protection or try experiments\r\nin free trade. Often their authority stretched out over a wide\r\ndistrict, and surrounding villages gathered to their markets and obeyed\r\ntheir laws;[2] it might even happen in the case of a staple town that\r\ntheir officers controlled the main foreign trade of whole provinces.\r\nIn matters that nearly concerned them they were given the right to\r\nlegislate for themselves, and where they were not allowed to make\r\nthe law, they at least secured the exclusive right of administering\r\nit; the King and the Parliament might issue orders as to weights and\r\nmeasures, or the rules to be observed by foreign merchants, but they\r\nwere powerless to enforce their decrees save through the machinery\r\nand with the consent of the town. Arduous duties were handed over to\r\nthem by the state—the supervision of the waters of a river basin, the\r\nkeeping of the peace on the seas. They sent out their trading barges in\r\nfleets under admirals of their own choosing, and leaned but lightly on\r\nstate aid for protection or revenge, answering pillage with pillage,\r\nand making their own treaties with the mariners of other countries as\r\nto capture and ransom and redemption of goods, and the treatment of\r\ncommon sailors or of “gentlemen” prisoners.[3] The necessity of their\r\nassent and co-operation in greater commercial matters was so clearly\r\nrecognized that when Henry the Seventh in 1495 made a league of peace\r\nand free trade with Burgundy the treaty was sent to all the chief\r\ntowns in England, that the mayor might affix to it the city seal, “for\r\nequality and stableness of the matter;” and the same form was observed\r\nat the marriage of the Lady Mary.[4] Two hundred and twenty-six\r\nburghers sat in Parliament[5] beside the seventy-four knights of\r\nthe shire; and each borough freely decided for itself what the\r\nqualifications of its members should be, and by what manner of election\r\nthey should be chosen, at a time when for country folk all such matters\r\nwere irrevocably settled by the king’s law. While the great lords with\r\ntheir armed bands of liveried retainers absolutely ruled the elections\r\nin the shires, in spite of all statutes of Parliament, the towns\r\nasserted their freedom to elect without fear or favour, and sent to\r\nthe House of Commons the members who probably at that time most nearly\r\nrepresented the “people,” that is so far as the people had yet been\r\ndrawn into a conscious share in the national life.\r\n\r\nFour hundred years later the very remembrance of this free and vigorous\r\nlife was utterly blotted out. When Commissioners were sent in 1835\r\nto enquire into the position of the English boroughs, there was not\r\none community where the ancient traditions still lived. There were\r\nMayors, and Town Councils, and Burgesses; but the burgesses were for\r\nthe most part deprived of any share whatever in the election of their\r\nmunicipal officers, while these officers themselves had lost all the\r\nnobler characteristics of their former authority. Too often the very\r\nlimits of the old “liberties” of the town were forgotten; or if the\r\nancient landmarks were remembered at all it was only because they\r\ndefined bounds within which the inhabitants had the right of voting\r\nfor a member of Parliament; and in cases where the old boundaries\r\nnow subsisted for no other reason, it was wholly forgotten that they\r\nmight ever have had some other origin. In other boroughs where the\r\nright of voting was determined in another way, the townspeople had\r\nsimply lost all remembrance of the ancient limits of their territory;\r\nor else, guided by some dim recollection of a former greatness with\r\nbroader jurisdiction and wide-reaching subject estates, the corporation\r\nstill yearly “walked the bounds” of lands over which they now claimed\r\nno authority. As the memory of municipal life died away there were\r\nboroughs where at last no one suspected that the corporate body\r\nhad ever existed for any larger purpose than to choose members of\r\nParliament. Knowing no other public honour or privilege and called\r\nto no other public service, the freemen saw in a single degraded\r\npolitical function the sole object of their corporate constitution; the\r\nrepresentation of the people was turned by them into “a property and a\r\ncommerce,” and this one privilege, fed on corruption and private greed,\r\nsurvived the decay of all the great duties of the ancient civic life.[6]\r\n\r\nThere were it is true exceptions to this common apathy, and towns like\r\nLynn might still maintain some true municipal life, while others like\r\nBristol might yet show a good fighting temper which counted for much\r\nin the political struggles of the early nineteenth century. But the\r\nordinary provincial burghers had lost, or forgotten, or been robbed of\r\nthe heritage bequeathed by their predecessors of the fifteenth century.\r\nWith the loss of their municipal independence went the loss of their\r\npolitical authority; and the four hundred or so of members whom they\r\nsent to Parliament took a very different position there from that once\r\nheld by their ancestors. In the Middle Ages the knights of the shire\r\nwere the mere nominees of the wealthy or noble class, returned to\r\nParliament by the power of the lord’s retainers, while the burgesses of\r\nthe towns preserved a braver and freer tradition.[7] At the time of the\r\nReform Bill, on the other hand, a vast majority of the town members sat\r\namong the Commons as dependents and servants of the landed aristocracy,\r\nwhose mission it was to make the will of their patrons prevail,\r\nand who in their corrupt or timid subjection simply handed back to\r\nthe wealthier class the supreme political power which artisans and\r\nshopkeepers and “mean people” of the mediæval boroughs had threatened\r\nto share with them.\r\n\r\nThe true story of this singular growth of independence in the English\r\nboroughs and of its no less singular decay would form one of the most\r\nstriking chapters in all our national history. But the materials for\r\nsuch a story, obscure, fragmentary, and scattered as they are, still\r\nlie hidden away in municipal archives, state rolls, and judicial\r\nrecords, as though the matter were one with which Englishmen had\r\nnothing to do. It is true indeed that the many ingenious expedients\r\nwhich the burghers devised to meet the peculiar difficulties of a\r\npast age would ill serve as models for our use to-day, nor can their\r\nsuccess or failure be urged on either side of our modern controversies.\r\nThey tell us nothing of the advantages or drawbacks of protection in\r\nour own time, or of the uses of state regulation of labour, or of\r\nthe advisability of trade guilds. We cannot revive their courts or\r\ntheir privileges, any more than we can set up their gallows or call\r\nout modern citizens to dig a moat that shall be their defence from\r\na hostile world. We cannot borrow their experience and live idly on\r\nthe wisdom of the dead. But there is no more striking study of the\r\nperpetual adjustment and contrivance by which living communities adapt\r\nthemselves to the changing order of the world than the study of our\r\nprovincial boroughs in the Middle Ages; and Englishmen who now stand in\r\nthe forefront of the world for their conception of freedom and their\r\npolitical capacity, and whose contribution to the art of government has\r\nbeen possibly the most significant fact of these last centuries, may\r\nwell look back from that great place to the burghers who won for them\r\ntheir birthright, and watch with a quickened interest the little stage\r\nof the mediæval boroughs where their forefathers once played their\r\npart, trying a dozen schemes of representation, constructing plans of\r\ngovernment, inventing constitutions, with a living energy which has not\r\nyet spent its force after traversing a score of generations.\r\n\r\nThere is no better starting point for the study of town life in England\r\nthan the fifteenth century itself, when, with ages of restless growth\r\nlying behind them, and with their societies as yet untouched by the\r\ninfluences of the Renascence or the Reformation or the new commercial\r\nsystem, the boroughs had reached their prosperous maturity. It would\r\nbe vain to attempt any reconstruction of their earlier history without\r\nhaving first stood, as it were, in the very midst of that turbulent\r\nsociety, and by watching the infinite variety of constitutional\r\ndevelopement learned to search out and estimate the manifold forces\r\nwhich had been at work to bring about so complex a result; and no\r\nstudy of their later history is possible without an understanding of\r\nthe prodigious vitality of the mediæval municipalities. There were\r\nthe workshops in which the political creed of England was fashioned,\r\nwhere the notion of a free commonwealth with the three estates of king,\r\nlords, and commons holding by common consent their several authority,\r\nwas proved and tested till it became the mere commonplace, the vulgar\r\nproperty of every Englishman. There the men who were ultimately to\r\nmake the Reformation were schooled in all the vexed questions between\r\nchurch and state, and in the practical meaning of interference in\r\ncivic matters by an alien power, so that the final crisis of religious\r\nexcitement was but the dramatic declamation on a grand scale of\r\nlessons diligently repeated class by class for many a generation\r\nbeforehand. There, too, long before the great national struggles of\r\nlater centuries between England and the continental powers exalted\r\npatriotism to its highest ardour, men were already inspired by the\r\nvision of the English nation holding its post against the world, and\r\nby a passionate allegiance to its great destiny; and in every market\r\nand harbour the love of country was quickened by the new commerce with\r\nits gigantic ambition to win for England the dominion of the seas, its\r\nfederations of merchants held together by the desperate struggle for\r\nsupremacy, and its hordes of pirates who swept the ocean with the wild\r\njoy of their Norse ancestors. There is no break in our history when the\r\nold world merged into the new, for the spirit of the fifteenth century\r\nwas the spirit of the sixteenth century as completely as it is the\r\nspirit of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe towns as we find them in the fifteenth century were the outcome of\r\ncenturies of preparation. It was by a very slow and gradual process\r\nthat England was transformed from a purely agricultural country, with\r\nits scattered villages of dependent tillers of the soil, into the\r\nEngland we know to-day—a land of industrial town communities, where\r\nagricultural interests are almost forgotten in the summing up of the\r\nnational wealth. Our modern towns, indeed, can almost all trace back\r\ntheir history into the obscurity of a very distant past; but their\r\nrecord as we find it in Domesday, or under the Norman kings, is simply\r\nthat of little country hamlets, where a few agricultural labourers\r\ngathered in their poor hovels, tilling by turns their lord’s land and\r\ntheir own small holdings; or of somewhat bigger villages which lay at\r\nthe branching of a great road, at a river ford, or at a convenient\r\nmeeting-place for fair or market, and thus grew into some little\r\nconsequence as the centres of a small local trade; while along the\r\ncoast a few seaports were just beginning to draw merchants with their\r\nwares to a land that had long been almost forgotten by the traders\r\nof the Continent. It was not till the twelfth century[8] that our\r\nboroughs began to have an independent municipal history—from the time,\r\nthat is, when the growth of the wool trade under Henry the First gave\r\nthem a new commercial life; and the organization of local government\r\nunder Henry the Second opened for them the way into a new world of\r\npolitical experiment and speculation.[9] From this time all went well\r\nwith the municipalities for three hundred years. In the course of\r\nthe thirteenth century the great majority of towns obtained rights\r\nof self-government, until finally these grants came to an end simply\r\nbecause there were no unenfranchised towns left.[10] Not indeed that\r\nthe flow of royal charters ceased, for burghers who had got the first\r\ninstalments of independence were constant in pressing for all such\r\nfurther privileges as could magnify their authority or protect their\r\ndignity; and successive generations of patriotic citizens gathered\r\ninto their town chests under the safe keeping of half a dozen locks\r\npiles of precious parchments, each of which conferred some new boon\r\nor widened the borders of liberty. Determined as it was by local\r\ncircumstances the struggle for independence was carried on after\r\nan irregular fashion, first in one town, then in another; here the\r\nburghers pressed forward riotously, and there loitered indifferently\r\nor stopped discouraged on their way. Some towns were allowed to elect\r\ntheir mayor before 1200,[11] others did not win the right till three\r\nor four centuries later; Bristol was made a shire in 1375, more than\r\na hundred years before Gloucester; and in the fifteenth century there\r\nwere still boroughs which had to gain their first charters, or else to\r\nexchange narrow and insufficient rights for full emancipation. But the\r\nforward movement never ceased; every victory counted for liberty, and\r\nevery success justified faith and inspired new zeal. The burghers went\r\non filling their purses on the one hand, and drawing up constitutions\r\nfor their towns on the other, till in the fifteenth century they were\r\nin fact the guardians of English wealth and the arbiters of English\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nAt first indeed municipal life, even at its best, was on a very humble\r\nscale. The biggest boroughs could probably in 1300 only make a show of\r\nfour or five thousand inhabitants, and of enfranchised burgesses a yet\r\nsmaller number;[12] while the mud or wood-framed huts with gabled roofs\r\nof thatch and reeds that lined their narrow lanes sheltered a people\r\nwho, accepting a common poverty, traded in little more than the mere\r\nnecessaries of life.[13] It was not till the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury that the towns as they entered on a larger industrial activity\r\nbegan to free themselves from the indescribable squalor and misery of\r\nthe early Middle Ages; but from this time forward we begin to detect\r\nsigns of stirring prosperity, at first under the guise of a frugal\r\nwell-being, and later carrying its luxury with happy ostentation. In\r\nthe course of the next hundred years we see trading ports such as Lynn,\r\nSandwich, Southampton, or Bristol, and centres of inland traffic such\r\nas Nottingham, Leicester, or Reading, and manufacturing towns like\r\nNorwich, Worcester, York, heaping up wealth, doubling and trebling\r\ntheir yearly expenditure, raising the salaries of their officers,\r\nbuilding new quarters, adorning their public offices and churches,\r\nlavishing money on the buying of new privileges for their citizens, or\r\non the extension of their trade. And while the bigger boroughs were\r\nthus enjoying their harvest of blessing and fat things, the small\r\nseaports and market towns also gathered in their share of the general\r\ngood fortune by which all England was enriched.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the town of Colchester, where from the time of the\r\nConquest a population of about 2,200 had found means to live, but in\r\nthose two hundred and fifty years had never added to their numbers.\r\nOf their manner of life we can tell something from the records of a\r\ntoll levied on their goods about 1300. One of the wealthiest tradesmen\r\nin the town was a butcher, whose valuation came to £7 15_s._ 2_d._;\r\nwhile the stock-in-hand of his brethren in the trade consisted mostly\r\nof brawn, lard, and a few salting tubs, though one had two carcases of\r\noxen at two shillings each, and another had meat worth thirty shillings\r\nin his shop. If we add to the butchers thirteen well-to-do tanners,\r\nand fourteen mercers who sold gloves, belts, leather, silk purses, and\r\nneedle-cases, besides cloth and flannel, and one even girdles (which,\r\nwith their silver ornaments, were costly articles), we have exhausted\r\nthe list of the Colchester plutocrats. In the course of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, however, the makers of cloth came to settle beside the tanners\r\nand butchers. Card-makers, combers, clothiers, weavers, fullers,\r\nand dyers gathered to the town, and spread their trade out into the\r\nneighbouring villages. Wool-mongers pushed their business, till in 1373\r\nthe bailiffs made the under-croft beneath the old Moot Hall into a\r\nWool Hall for the convenience of dealers, and added a fine porch with\r\na vault overhanging the entrance to the Moot Hall, and some shops with\r\nsolars over them. Before the century had closed the population had more\r\nthan doubled. The poor houses that once lined the streets were swept\r\naway, and wealthy men built shops in the new style with chambers over\r\nthem fronting the street, and let them to shopkeeping tenants.[14]\r\n\r\nIn the little trading town of Bridport we have the same story. In 1319\r\nBridport, with its one hundred and eighty burgesses, could not at a\r\n“view of arms,” or muster of fighting men, produce a single burgher\r\nwho bore bow and arrows, and sent out its motley regiment equipped\r\nwith the universal knife or dagger, or, as it might chance, with\r\nstaves, hatchets, pole-axes, forks, or spears, while an aristocrat\r\nor two actually bore a sword. Only sixty-seven burgesses out of the\r\none hundred and eighty paid taxes, and the general poverty seems to\r\nhave been extreme. The richest man had one cow, two hogs, two brass\r\nplatters, a few hides, and a little furniture—the whole worth £4\r\n8_s._; and one of the most respectable innkeepers of the place owned\r\ntwo hogs, two beds, two table-cloths, two hand napkins, a horse, a\r\nbrass pot, a platter, a few wooden vessels, and some malt.[15] In 1323\r\nthings were a trifle better, for eighty persons were then taxed, the\r\nproperty of some of them being valued only at six shillings, and this\r\nunder a system in which the whole of each man’s possessions was exactly\r\nreckoned up—his cards, yarn, shoes, the girths he was making or trying\r\nto sell, even his store of oatmeal. A century later, however, we find\r\na new Bridport. Traders from Bristol had settled in its streets,\r\nand men of Holland and foreign merchants and craftsmen; and the\r\ntownsfolk had grown prosperous and began to bind themselves together\r\nin fraternities—the brotherhood of S. Nicholas, the brotherhood of S.\r\nMary and S. James, the brotherhood of the Two Torches, a brotherhood\r\nof the Light of the Holy Cross in S. Andrew’s, and another in S.\r\nMary’s, and the brotherhood of the Torches in the Church of the Blessed\r\nMary—apparently the offspring of the first half of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The Toll Hall was repaired, the houses in the town set in\r\norder, and a new causeway made. The Guild Hall got its clock; the\r\nchurch was rebuilt and fitted up with organs, and sittings in it were\r\nlet out to the wealthy burghers. When, finally, a “view of arms” was\r\nagain held in the town in 1458, there was not a single name left of\r\nthose who had appeared in the list of 1319. But these new traders came\r\nbravely set out with bows and arrows, as well as with daggers, bills,\r\npole-axes, or spears, or marching proudly with their mails, jacks,\r\nsalets, and “white harness with a basenet.” The Bridport standard had\r\nchanged, and one man who came carrying quite an armoury—a gun, besides\r\na bow, twelve arrows, a sword, and a buckler—was ordered to have\r\ntwelve more arrows at the next muster.[16]\r\n\r\nEven towns which like Rye had known all the calamities of war were\r\nonly waiting for a moment of peace to win their share of the common\r\nprosperity. Burned by the French in 1377, burned and laid desolate\r\nagain in 1448, Rye long remained on the level of poverty common in\r\nthe Middle Ages. In 1414 it sheltered a mere handful of struggling\r\npeople—twenty-one poor householders in Nesse Ward, twenty-eight in\r\nWater Melle Ward, and a somewhat larger number in Market Ward equally\r\npoor; within its walls, in fact, there was but one man—the lord of\r\nthe manor—who was assessed at so great a sum as 6_s._ 8_d._, though\r\nthere was the beginning of a fashionable suburb in the Ward without\r\nthe Gate, where the Mayor lived with some dozen other well-to-do\r\nhouseholders, two of whom besides the Mayor were assessed at the\r\naristocratic figure of 6_s._ 8_d._ By the end of the century, however,\r\nRye fishermen were known on distant seas and Rye traders in the fairs\r\nat home and abroad. London merchants had bought property in the\r\nthriving town, and new quarters had sprung up with names borrowed from\r\nthe capital—Paternoster Ward and Bucklersbury Ward. In 1493 five of\r\nthe burghers were assessed as owning £400 each, and the total value of\r\nthe property possessed by the inhabitants was £6,303.[17]\r\n\r\nEvidence of accumulating wealth indeed gathers on every side. The\r\nlabour and enterprise which in earlier centuries had covered England\r\nwith castles and cathedrals and monasteries was now absorbed in the\r\nwork of covering it with new towns. A journey through any part of the\r\ncountry to-day is enough to show us how ruthlessly the men of the\r\nfifteenth century swept away the parish churches which their fathers\r\nhad built in the fourteenth century, to replace them with the big bare\r\nfabrics where size and ostentation too often did service for beauty,\r\nand in the building of which prosperous burghers gave more conspicuous\r\nproof of wealth and lavish generosity than of taste and feeling. In\r\nCanterbury and Worcester and Nottingham and Bristol and a host of other\r\ntowns we may still admire the new houses that were being raised for the\r\ntraders, with their picturesque outlines and fine carved work. Waste\r\nplaces in the boroughs were covered with buildings and formed into\r\nnew wards. On every side corporations instinct with municipal pride\r\nbuilt Common Halls, set up stately crosses in the market-place such\r\nas we still see at Winchester or Marlborough, paved the streets,[18]\r\nor provided new water-supply for the growing population.[19] If we\r\ncount up the new gates, and quays, and bridges, and wharves, and\r\nharbours, and sluices, and aqueducts, and markets of which the town\r\nrecords furnish accounts, we are filled with amazement at an activity\r\nwhich was really stupendous. Public duty and private enterprise went\r\nhand in hand. Sometimes the whole commonalty was called out to help at\r\nthe church-building, or the digging of a new harbour; sometimes the\r\ncharity once given to religious uses was turned into the channel of\r\ncivic patriotism, and good citizens left money to found hospitals and\r\nalmshouses and schools, to pave the streets, to pay the tolls of their\r\ntown, to fee lawyers to defend its privileges, or buy a charter to\r\nprotect its rights from invasion. Thus it was two traders of Canterbury\r\nwho built in 1400 the first private bridge over the river; and in 1485\r\na mercer from London, William Pratt, constructed at his own expense\r\nthe first main drain under the Old Street to carry off the rain-water\r\ninto the river.[20] In Birmingham the whole community formed itself\r\ninto a “guild and lasting brotherhood” for the doing of works of\r\ncharity, and chiefly it would seem for the repairing of two great stone\r\nbridges and divers foul and dangerous ways on the high road to Wales—a\r\nwork which the Corporation was too poor to undertake.[21]\r\n\r\nNor was this growth in wealth the only, or indeed the most striking\r\npart of the town’s history during these three centuries from the\r\ntime of Henry the Second to the time of Henry the Seventh. Trade is\r\npretty much the same wherever it exists at all, and from its narrow\r\ndominion much of human energy will always make a way to escape. When\r\nEnglishmen had spent a measure of their force in creating a nation of\r\nshopkeepers, there was still enough of buoyant and exuberant strength\r\nleft to elaborate an art of government which has affected the history\r\nof the world; and the truly characteristic part of the mediæval story\r\nis that which enables us to measure the political genius with which the\r\nforerunners of our modern democracy shaped schemes of administration\r\nfor the societies they had created of free workers. There was much\r\nto be done in the new ordering of life.[22] Already in the twelfth\r\ncentury a new force had declared itself when in France the middle and\r\nlower classes for the first time found a voice in literature. From that\r\ntime onwards poets of the people and teachers of socialism, writing in\r\nthe vulgar tongue for common folk, proposed startling questions and\r\nboldly pressed home their conclusions. Nothing was safe from their\r\ncriticism; as they discussed the original rights of men, the “social\r\ncontract” between the people and their lords, the tyranny of nobles, or\r\nthe rights of peasants,[23] these new thinkers among the people gave\r\nwarning of growing energies too big and passionate to live at ease in\r\nthe narrow bondage of mediæval custom and tradition. The inevitable\r\nchanges however came slowly, and those who lived in the midst of the\r\nmovement were themselves unconscious of the real transformation that\r\nwas going on. Even at the end of the fourteenth century the writer of\r\nPiers Ploughman, when he paints for us the picture of the feudal world\r\nas it then was, has no dream that its bondage can ever be broken, that\r\nthere is any escape out of the prison-house of mediæval society. For\r\nthe first time we there see England, not as it appeared to historians\r\nand satirists of the court or the monastery, but as it looked to one\r\nstanding in the very midst of that vast “field full of folk from end\r\nto other”—to the poet who walked among the people with his heart full\r\nof charity and pity, who by day mixed with the crowd at the fair, or\r\nwatched the bargainings in the market-place, or travelled along country\r\nby-ways and entered the hovels of the poor, and at night sat in the\r\nale-house among beggars and mendicant friars. But while he shows us\r\nall the trouble and confusion of that tumultuous crowd, the social\r\norder remains to him simple and unchangeable—fixed, in his belief, as\r\nfirmly as the decrees of God and nature could establish it. He could\r\nonly repeat the old time-honoured counsels of work and obedience as the\r\nfinal remedy for all social ills: “Counsel not the commons the King to\r\ndisplease.” But it was more than possible that work and obedience might\r\nstill leave, as it had left before, life empty of all but misery. Then\r\nthe last solace lay in resignation.\r\n\r\n  “Yea, quoth Patience, and hente out of his poke\r\n  A piece of the Pater Noster and proffered to us all.\r\n  And I listened and looked what livelihood it were;\r\n  Then was it ‘Fiat voluntas tua’ that should find us all.\r\n  ‘Have, Actyf,’ quoth Patience, ‘and eat this when thee hungreth\r\n  Or when thou clomsest for cold or clyngest for drought;\r\n  And shall never gyves thee grieve nor great lord’s wrath,\r\n  Prison nor other pain for—_patientes vincunt_.”[24]\r\n\r\nSuch was Langland’s final solution for the disorders of his time.\r\nBut the English were not a patient people, and the problem of the\r\nreorganization of society had become a very serious one towards the\r\nclose of the Middle Ages, and was perhaps more urgent to men’s fears\r\nand consciences in the fifteenth century than it had ever been before,\r\nor was to be again till our own day. It was a pressing question for\r\nhumble folk, for shopkeepers and traders and artisans and journeymen\r\nwho in the absence of privilege were driven to think of liberty; and in\r\nthe crowded lanes, the mean workshops, the disorderly market-place, the\r\nlittle thatched Common Hall of the mediæval town, great principles of\r\nfreedom found their early home, and fought their way to perfection and\r\nsupremacy. It was not enough that the burghers should create societies\r\nof free men—”_gentlemen_,” as Piers Ploughman would have said,[25]\r\nto whom the great difference that distinguished between man and man\r\nwas not wealth or poverty, labour or ease, but freedom or bondage.\r\nThis was the easier part of their task, and was practically finished\r\nearly in their history. It was a longer and more difficult business\r\nto discover how the art of government should be actually practised in\r\nthese communities, and to define the principles of their political\r\nexistence. But in these matters also the burghers became the pioneers\r\nof our liberties, and their political methods have been handed down as\r\npart of the heritage of the whole people. As by degrees the multitude\r\nof privileges promised and confirmed left the important towns with no\r\nmore demands to make, they turned their energies to the work of framing\r\nthose elaborate and highly artificial constitutions which mark the\r\nhighest point to which their proud and self-sufficient independence had\r\nattained. Instead of tamely accepting the pattern or the theory of its\r\nneighbours, every town was making its own peculiar experiment in the\r\nart of governing, with a vivacity and a restless ingenuity proper to\r\nthe culminating moment of their activity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile by a happy coincidence the boroughs were called to take part\r\nin the great movement by which the House of Commons was created, at a\r\ntime when the discipline and experience of local self-government had\r\nprepared them to exercise a very real influence in the moulding of\r\nthe English constitution into its present form. Having for the most\r\npart secured their fundamental liberties just before Simon de Montfort\r\nin 1265 summoned the middle class to take their share in the work of\r\nParliament, and having steadily strengthened their position during\r\nall the thirty years of changing counsels and tentative experiments\r\nwhich followed, they saw the representation of the boroughs definitely\r\nestablished in 1295—the very year after county representation had\r\nbeen at last perfectly acknowledged.[26] If for a time they played\r\napparently a small part in political battles, if the separate action\r\nof the borough members is scarcely mentioned,[27] the fact still\r\nremains that throughout the century during which the House of Commons\r\nwas being fashioned[28] members sent from these free self-governing\r\ncommunities formed almost two-thirds of that House. Edward the First\r\nsent Parliamentary writs to 166 towns, and in the Parliament of 1399,\r\n176 representatives of boroughs sat by the seventy-four knights of the\r\nshire.[29] Silent and acquiescent as they were for a while, there are\r\nsignificant instances to show the steady growth of their importance,\r\nand the way in which statesmen had begun to appreciate the new force\r\nwith which governments had henceforth to reckon.[30] By the close of\r\nthe fourteenth century their influence was marked; and it was doubtless\r\nthrough its vigorous burghers that the House of Commons in the early\r\npart of the fifteenth century laid hold of powers which it had never\r\nhad before, nor was to have again for two hundred years.[31] In the\r\nlist of petitions and statutes throughout the century in which their\r\ninfluence on legislation was plainly dominant, we may look for the\r\ntrue beginning of democratic government in England.[32] Indeed at a\r\nyet earlier time, when the House of Commons was not seventy years old,\r\nits power had been already measured and men’s imaginations kindled by\r\nits mighty destiny. If supreme over all the King kept his state at\r\nWestminster,\r\n\r\n                          “him lord antecedent,\r\n  Both their head and their King, holding with no party,\r\n  But stand as a stake that sticketh in a mire\r\n  Between two lands for a true mark”;\r\n\r\nif his power was absolute, and he could\r\n\r\n                        “claim the commons at his will\r\n  To follow him, to find him, and to fetch at them his counsel,”[33]\r\n\r\nyet even then Conscience warned the sovereign that to frame a righteous\r\ngovernment “without the commons’ help it is full hard, by my head”;[34]\r\nand Reason\r\n\r\n          “counselled the King his commons to love,\r\n  For the commons is the King’s treasure.”[35]\r\n\r\nThe whole part however played by the towns in national politics, the\r\ndegree of influence they exercised, in what ways it differed from that\r\nof the aristocratic class, how it affected matters of administration,\r\nfinance, foreign policy, commercial laws, the strength of the monarchy,\r\nand the forms of the constitution—all these questions have still to\r\nbe investigated. What is perfectly clear is that wise rulers in those\r\ndays saw the tremendous change that was taking place in the balance of\r\nforces in the State, as even the most foolish among them felt that the\r\npower of the purse at least was passing from the country magnates to\r\nthe town merchants;[36] and they gave expression to their convictions\r\nby a change in the whole character of their policy. To kings and\r\nstatesmen the friendship of the burghers even in times of comparative\r\nquiet was daily becoming a matter of greater consequence to be bought\r\nat their own price. It was no longer the nobles whom they sought to\r\nbribe to their interest, but the towns; and as gifts and pensions to\r\nCourt favourites declined, courtesies and gracious remissions of rent\r\nwere lavished on the boroughs.[37] From this time, even when the towns\r\nhad fallen to their lowest estate, their heritage of power was never\r\nwholly lost, and through their later humiliation and corruption we may\r\nstill discover the evidence of their political consequence, since the\r\nmeasure of their influence was in fact the price set on their obedience.\r\n\r\nIf such a tale of long centuries of national growth ending in a\r\nsatisfied maturity carries its suggestion of dull monotony, we need\r\nonly turn to the history of towns in other times and places to discover\r\nthat in this very monotony is hidden a real element of singularity.\r\nThe most striking contrast lies perhaps close at hand, in the brilliant\r\nand dramatic story of the communes in France—the shortest lived of all\r\nthe feudal independent lordships in Europe.[38] Of earlier origin than\r\nthe English, their history goes back to the first part of the twelfth\r\ncentury, fifty years before the movement had effectively begun in\r\nEngland; and the story of their liberties is, taken all together, but a\r\nbrief tale of some two hundred years, from 1130 to 1330. Their progress\r\nwas rapid and their decay as swift. Indeed decline had already set in\r\nby 1223, at the very time when Norwich, Nottingham, and a number of the\r\ngreater English towns were just receiving for the first time powers\r\nof choosing their own rulers and administering their own justice. In\r\n1280 their condition was almost hopeless,[39] and half a century later\r\nthe life of the free communities was over and their liberties utterly\r\nextinguished, saving always the liberty to carry on trade.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we can only wonder that the attempt lasted for two hundred\r\nyears, set as they were amid difficulties wholly unknown to English\r\nburghers, or with the ghosts or dim reflections of which these at the\r\nworst had only to contend in a kind of phantom fight. What were the\r\nfar-off echoes of foreign conquest or defeat heard on our side of the\r\nwater, or the report of an occasional local rising, compared to the\r\ndevastating wars that swept the plains of France, and amid the miseries\r\nof which the communes were struggling into life? The necessities\r\nof war proved fatal to local liberty, and that in more ways than\r\none. If warring kings and lords created independent communities for\r\ntheir own purposes, with the sole idea of forming fortified centres\r\ncapable of self-defence, such communes could hardly prove strongholds\r\nof freedom, and the self-government of the people soon fell in fact\r\nbefore the requirements of military discipline. Sometimes the death of\r\nfreedom was brought about by more violent methods; and the trembling\r\ninhabitants who made their way back from the woods to their ruined\r\nhomes after a town had been sacked and burned by the enemy, would\r\npray to be disenfranchised that they might thus be delivered from\r\nthe burdens and dues of a commune which they were no longer able to\r\nmaintain. Abroad moreover feudalism retained the authority which had\r\nbeen torn from it here by Norman kings, and was yet more dangerous\r\nto the burghers than war itself. Against the might of their feudal\r\nlord, king or noble or ecclesiastic, they could make in the long run\r\nbut a sorry fight, and perhaps after a century of desperate struggle\r\nfor emancipation in which the peasants saw their brethren slain in\r\nthousands, their farms devastated, their wealth torn from them, their\r\nemigrants driven back starving to plundered homesteads, the outcome\r\nof all their misery was finally to gain a few trading privileges by\r\nconsenting to a charter which once more laid them bound at the feet\r\nof their master. Too often the lord avoided open violence by calling\r\npolitical craft to his aid, and devised for his burghers some form of\r\ncharter which while it admirably suited his own purposes robbed the\r\ncommunal government of any true democratic element and made the name\r\nof liberty a mockery. As for the vast number of towns big and little\r\nunder ecclesiastical dominion, they contended in vain against princes\r\nof the Church whose mighty state was measured on the grand scale of the\r\nContinent—princes with the Pope always in the background, ready at\r\ntheir complaint to fulminate the decree of excommunication which left\r\nall the burghers’ goods at the mercy of their lord. Whether the prelate\r\nsought to annihilate rebellious serfs with fire and sword, whether\r\nwith more subtle intention he devised some cunningly delusive form of\r\ncharter, or contrived to hinder all the operations of free government,\r\nto thwart its developement, and to check the spread of its influence,\r\nthe tragic close was always at hand—political slavery and degradation.\r\nAmid the innumerable troubles that compassed the French communes round\r\nabout, the administrative difficulties, the financial cares, the public\r\nbankruptcy of town after town, the evil moments when the king’s fiscal\r\nofficer and the starving people made alliance to destroy the privileges\r\nof the burghers, civic freedom failed. Time and fate were allied\r\nagainst the commune, and the issue of the battle was decided before the\r\nfight had well begun.\r\n\r\nAgainst the century of growth and the century of decay which made up\r\nthe record of the French communes, we have to set three hundred years\r\nof unbroken prosperity and privilege in which the English burghers\r\nadded charter to charter and filled their “common chests” with a\r\nregularity that knew no check. It is not necessary, however, to assume\r\nthat Englishmen reached that happy state wholly by virtue of their\r\nnative superiority; it would perhaps be truer to thank the good fortune\r\nof insignificance that so long waited on them. England, in fact, was\r\nlagging far away in the rear, where there was little of the noise and\r\ndust of battle. It was not there that the idea of municipal liberty was\r\nfirst proclaimed; for in the Dark Ages of riot and disorder and piracy,\r\nCelts, Latins, Teutons, all the members of the European brotherhood in\r\nfact, found in association their natural succour against danger and\r\naid to labour; and along the great trade routes that traversed Europe\r\nthe more important societies of men confederated for protection and\r\nassistance were formed before ever Englishmen had begun to organize\r\nthemselves into self-governing communities. In that European drama,\r\neverything took great continental proportions; men disputed for\r\ntremendous stakes, and in the long battle the mighty lords of the old\r\nworld were never wholly routed, but still laid their grip on the modern\r\nsociety that was struggling to usher in a new order. In the great\r\nfight there were great defeats, such as we have seen in France, and\r\nliberty had to begin its course afresh and lead men along new roads\r\nin search of freedom and content. But we in our distant island had\r\nthroughout the Middle Ages all the advantages of obscurity. According\r\nto any valid method of determining our place in the European order,\r\nwhether by yearly income, or size of merchant fleets, or strength of\r\narmies, or number of inhabitants, we remained for a time after the loss\r\nof Normandy and Anjou unimportant in the eyes of Europe-of little\r\naccount among the peoples; and as far as popular feeling went ourselves\r\nheedless of what went on on the Continent.[40] Tranquil and secure\r\nbecause no one took the trouble to think of us while we were regardless\r\nof their quarrels, we were left to learn our lessons as slowly as we\r\nwould, to lay sure, if lowly, foundations, to practise our skill by\r\nsafe experiments till our art was mastered. The humble display which\r\nwe made in our national capacity was repeated in our municipal story.\r\nThere indeed the tiny dominion of the community, the sparse population,\r\nthe poor little treasure-box, the solitary “common barge,” the handful\r\nof militia passing in review with their clubs and forks, present a\r\nsorry figure beside the majestic state of the big corporations over\r\nsea. But this humble condition was their true security. Set from the\r\nfirst in pleasant places where by conquering kings the lofty had been\r\nbrought low and the humble lifted up, and where no enemy of invincible\r\nstrength lay any longer across their path, the burghers might carry on\r\ntheir own business without care. Within the narrow area enclosed by\r\nthe city wall and ditch, amid a scanty population scarcely bigger than\r\nthat of a small country town to-day, experiments which would have been\r\nimpossible on a great scale were tried with every conceivable variety\r\nof circumstance and expedient; and the boroughs owed to their early\r\ninsignificance and isolation a freedom from restraint and dictation in\r\nwhich real political experience became possible.\r\n\r\nThus in England, as elsewhere, the character of the nation and the\r\nmould of its political thought were ultimately shaped by outward\r\ncircumstance; and the forms of our freedom have been profoundly\r\naffected by the way which the towns took to liberty, by the manner in\r\nwhich they modified its expression according to the peculiar conditions\r\nto which each community was subject, and by the use they made of their\r\npower. But since the very existence of the towns as important centres\r\nof life, as well as the character of their development, depends on the\r\ncomplete transformation which English society underwent in the later\r\nMiddle Ages, I venture, before beginning my real story, to give a very\r\nbrief and rapid sketch of the Industrial and Commercial Revolution in\r\nwhich mediæval England was buried and modern England born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE history of the fifteenth century has long remained but little\r\nknown. It is very generally regarded as the “profoundly tragic close\r\nof a great epoch,” and the historian looks back to the golden age of\r\nthe thirteenth century as the glorious time of English and of European\r\nhistory—the culminating period to which all the foregoing generations\r\nslowly mounted, and from whose heights the later sons of men as slowly\r\nand surely declined and went backward. The period of this backsliding\r\nis seen as an age altogether wanting in picturesqueness and moral\r\nelevation, sunk in materialism, sordid and vulgar, a time of confused\r\nand indiscriminate corruption, where “heart and treasure” were linked\r\nin ignoble union, and the political demoralization of the people was\r\nonly matched by their private degradation; and the fifteenth century\r\nhas long borne the heavy burden of its evil reputation, while its\r\nrecords have been left comparatively undisturbed by inquisitive\r\nsearch.[41] For hackneyed as the period of the Wars of the Roses\r\nmay seem to the superficial reader, no student has yet adequately\r\nstudied the secret of the age in which the great revolutions of the\r\nnext century were being prepared—the age which made possible for\r\nEngland the revival of letters and the reformation, which founded her\r\ncommercial greatness, which revolutionized her industrial system, which\r\ncast away the last bonds of feudalism and laid the foundations of the\r\nmodern State.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed true that no great man has made this century illustrious.\r\nNo general or warrior of the first rank distinguished wars which were\r\nborn in iniquity, and kept alive by greed. No gifted statesman left\r\nhis mark on the government or administration of the country. Among\r\nthe people themselves interest in national affairs seemed dead; they\r\nmade revolutions and set up new kings as they were bidden to do, and\r\nkept stores of badges of the houses of York and Lancaster alike, to be\r\nready with either sign of loyalty as the fortunes of war turned this\r\nway or that;[42] they forgot the stirring political ballads of former\r\ngenerations and sang moral ditties instead. In place of the mighty\r\ntheologians of an earlier time there came commentators and interpreters\r\nof little significance. Nor did a single religious leader or reformer\r\nor scholar arise to stir the popular thought or conscience: Lollardy\r\nwith its questionings and criticisms was still heard of from time to\r\ntime in the bigger towns and manufacturing districts, but the people\r\ngenerally acquiesced in the demands of the authorized religion and\r\ndiscipline. Literature was well nigh lost as well as the graver kinds\r\nof learning. In the beginning of the century one or two nobles had\r\ncollected libraries and brought tidings of the Renascence in Italy,\r\nand later on half a dozen scholars made their way to the Italian\r\nuniversities; but there was neither poet nor scholar to follow the\r\nmasters of an earlier age. In the fifteenth century the very language\r\nin which Chaucer wrote was but half intelligible to the mass of the\r\npeople, and his tales must have been unknown out of court circles.\r\nMen were content with rhymes innumerable—on morals, on manners, on\r\nheraldry, on the art of dining, on the rules of thrift and prosperity;\r\nand in all our history there is no time so barren in literature as the\r\nreign of Henry the Sixth.\r\n\r\nEven in a democratic age it is not easy at first sight to recognise\r\nwhere the interest lies of an epoch destitute of all that has made\r\nother times illustrious, and whose significance seems to shrink\r\nin comparison with the struggles and victories of the ages that\r\npreceded, and the splendid achievements of the age that followed\r\nit; and historians finding themselves face to face with so dreary a\r\ncentury may have been tempted to give it a character of its own for\r\ngrossness, for cruelty, for any distinction whatever which will at\r\nleast take it out of the range of the absolutely commonplace. But\r\nthe distinguishing mark of the fifteenth century lies neither in its\r\ncrime nor in its vulgarity. We must judge this period in fact as a\r\ntime of transition in many ways extraordinarily like our own. In the\r\ncenturies between the Great Plague and the Reformation, just as in the\r\nnineteenth century, the real significance of our history lies in the\r\nadvent of a new class to wealth and power, as the result of a great\r\nindustrial revolution. The breaking up of an old aristocratic order,\r\nand the creation of a middle class to be brought into politics and\r\neven into “society,” the enormous increase of material wealth, the new\r\nrelation of the various ranks to one another, and the failure under\r\naltered circumstances of traditional rules of conduct, the varied\r\ncareers suddenly opened to talent or ambition, the reproach for the\r\nfirst time attached to incompetence and poverty, the vulgarization of\r\nliterature and morality which followed on their adaptation to a class\r\nas yet untrained to criticism or comparison, the extension of a habit\r\nof religion closely related to a plain morality—all these things\r\nrecall to us many of the experiences of our own days, and may make us\r\nmore tolerant of the unpicturesque and Philistine element whether then\r\nor now. If the chief centre of interest had once lain in the offices\r\nof the royal palace it might now be seen rather in the new Town Hall\r\nwhich was being built in almost every borough in England, or in the\r\noffice where the mayor’s clerk was busied in making his copies of Magna\r\nCharta or extracts of Domesday, or in translating from the old French\r\nthe customs and ordinances of the town, or in hunting up the rolls\r\nof the itinerant judges; or over the country-side where estates were\r\nbeing sold and bought with the development of a provincial instead of\r\na national nobility and the rise of new men to possess the old acres,\r\nand where the quickening of the struggle for life was reflected in the\r\nstormy conflicts and significant concessions of the manor courts. The\r\nnew middle class of shopkeepers and farmers had indeed no chroniclers\r\nand no flatterers, for it was long before men could realise how rapidly\r\nand completely the weight of influence was being transferred from the\r\nold governing class to the mass of the governed, and chroniclers still\r\nwent on mechanically retailing events now comparatively trivial and\r\nunimportant. It was not till the next century that they turned from\r\nspinning out these worthless annals to a discussion of matters really\r\nimportant which had by that time forced themselves on the dullest\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\nThe whole interest of the fifteenth century thus lies in the life\r\nof very common folk—of artisans and tradesmen in the towns, and in\r\ncountry parts of the farmers, the tenants of the new grazing lands,\r\nthe stewards and bailiffs and armies of dependents on the great\r\nestates, who did all the work at home while the lord was away at\r\nthe wars or at the halls of Westminster. If the century produced no\r\ngreat administrator or statesman, it did create a whole class of\r\nmen throughout the country trained in practical affairs, doing an\r\nadmirable work of local government, active, enterprising, resolute,\r\npublic-spirited, disciplined in the best of all schools for political\r\nservice. If there was no great writer, the new world of the middle\r\nclass was patiently teaching itself, founding its schools, learning its\r\nprimary rules of etiquette and its simple maxims of morals, reading its\r\nmanuals of agriculture or law or history, practising its Latin rhymes,\r\nand building up in its own fashion from new beginnings a learning\r\nwhich the aristocratic class had been too proud, too indifferent, or\r\ntoo remote to hand on to it.[43] If no religious revival shook the\r\ncountry, the new society was solving in its own way the problem of\r\nhelping the sick and poor;[44] it was earnest in religious observance,\r\nit was framing its English litanies and devising its own plans for\r\nteaching the people an intelligent devotion.[45] The burghers began\r\nto perform in the national economy the work which in earlier centuries\r\nhad been performed by the great monastic societies. The extension of\r\ntrade and manufacture had fallen into their hands; they were busied\r\nin the gathering together and storing up of the national wealth.[46]\r\nThey gave to labour a new dignity in social life and a new place in\r\nthe national councils. From the towns came a perpetual protest against\r\nwar and disorder; throughout the troubles of the fifteenth century,\r\ncivil war, court intrigues, the tyranny of usurpers and the plots of\r\nthe vanquished, local raids of private revenge or of land hunger,\r\ntheir influence was always thrown on the side of peace and quietness.\r\nArt found in them patrons; illuminators and painters, architects and\r\nbell-founders, the makers of delicate shrines and images,[47] engravers\r\nof seals, goldsmiths and workers in brass, whether of English birth or\r\nbrought from foreign parts, prospered within their gates; while their\r\nharpers and minstrels doubtless had a part in the musical developement\r\nof the country at a time when English artists set the fashion of the\r\nbest music as far as the court of Burgundy.[48] They laid in fact the\r\nfoundations of a new English society. The men of the New Learning, the\r\nmen of the Reformation, the men who revealed the New World, were men\r\nwho had been formed under the influences of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nAll this activity was the outcome of the great industrial and\r\ncommercial revolution which was passing over the country. Until the\r\nmiddle of the fourteenth century, England had been to Europe what\r\nAustralia is to-day—a country known only as the provider of the raw\r\nmaterial of commerce.[49] At the close of the fifteenth century she had\r\ntaken her place as a centre of manufactures, whose finished goods were\r\ndistributed in all the great markets of the Mediterranean and of the\r\nNorthern Seas. It is no wonder that during a change which transformed\r\nthe country from a land of agricultural villages into a land of\r\nmanufacturing towns, and opened for her the mighty struggle to become\r\nthe carrier of the world’s commerce, the whole energy of her people,\r\nthrown into a single channel, should be absorbed in accomplishing their\r\nenormous task. Every one was honestly busy in learning either how to\r\nmake or how to sell, and in conquering the difficulties that beset\r\ntraders as they strove to push their way into the world’s market on\r\nequal or, if possible, more than equal terms with competitors who had\r\nlong held unquestioned supremacy.\r\n\r\nFrom the twelfth century wool had been the one great export of England,\r\nand the one great source of wealth for nobles, churchmen, farmers, even\r\nkings. So important was its sale that statesmen very early saw the\r\nnecessity of securing for the national Exchequer a share in the profits\r\nof the main national trade; and in aid of the royal treasury they\r\ndevised in the first half of the thirteenth century a system which was\r\nquite peculiar to England, the organization of the Staple.[50]\r\n\r\nThe Staple was an appointed place to which alone certain goods might be\r\nbrought for sale, raw materials such as wool, wool-fells, skins, lead,\r\nor tin, of which wool was far the most important. Fixed for the first\r\nhundred years in some foreign town, generally in Bruges, it was shifted\r\nfrom place to place by Edward the Third, who from 1353 made various\r\nexperiments as to establishing it in England; but finally about 1390,\r\nCalais was decided upon as the most advantageous spot. Thither every\r\ndealer had to carry his wares (unless he was ready to pay a high tax to\r\nthe Crown, or to buy at the King’s price a license for free trading);\r\nand he must carry them along certain appointed routes only—from\r\nLincoln by St. Botolph, from Norwich by Yarmouth, from Westminster by\r\nLondon, from Canterbury by Sandwich, from Winchester by Southampton,\r\nas the government in its wisdom might decide. In a kind of secondary\r\nsense these places where the wool was gathered for export thus became\r\ntowns of the Staple, and certain officers, Mayors and Aldermen of the\r\nStaple were appointed to control their trade. The merchants’ goods,\r\nfirst weighed at the point of departure, must be weighed again at the\r\nport where they were shipped, and sealed with the seal of the Mayor\r\nof the Staple, while to check fraud there was an elaborate system of\r\nofficial papers to be sent to the Treasury in London and to the Staple\r\nin Calais for every such transaction of weighing and toll-taking.\r\nEvery possible precaution was taken to maintain the position of the\r\nmerchants in the European market by rules which practically forced the\r\nwool into the hands of foreign and not native buyers, so that English\r\ntraders complained that their interests were sacrificed to courting\r\nthe patronage of the Continent. If, for example, the chief Staple town\r\nwas for any reason moved from over sea to England, native dealers were\r\nabsolutely forbidden to export any Staple wares, so that foreigners\r\nmight be forced or encouraged to come and take part in the trade.\r\nForeign dealers were allowed to vote along with them for officials, and\r\nso late as 1445 the English merchants vainly prayed that no Stapler\r\nmight take part in election of Mayor or Constable of the Staple unless\r\nhe had ten sacks of wool cocketed at Calais.\r\n\r\nIn thus forcing all the export trade of the country through one\r\nnarrow channel the first purpose of the State was merely to provide\r\na convenient method of gathering customs into the Exchequer; and in\r\ncourse of time it further discovered that this trading system might\r\nbe used as a weapon against foreign peoples in case of quarrel. But\r\nthe very last object of the Staple organization was the convenience of\r\nthe traders. Nor had the merchants themselves any illusions in this\r\nrespect. To them the Staple seemed at its beginning contrary to the\r\nliberties of Magna Charta;[51] and a long experience taught them how\r\nits provisions might keep them shut in between the rapacity of those\r\nin authority and the hatred of the farmers who produced the wool which\r\nthey sold.[52] They could however still wring a rich advantage out\r\nof superficial calamity—the advantage to be found in monopoly and\r\ncorporate privilege—and this was developed with consummate art. The\r\nwool trade gathered into their hands was hedged round with monopolies\r\nand regulations, protected by fixed prices and times of sale. The\r\nconcourse of customers at Calais was diligently maintained; no buyer\r\nwas allowed to order his work through a commission house, so that\r\ntraders might be forced to come to the market in person and do their\r\nbusiness. By the charter of Edward the Third a Mayor and twenty-four\r\nAldermen chosen by the whole body of merchants absolutely ruled the\r\nStaple trade, appointed officers, supervised markets, made regulations\r\nas to the treatment of foreigners, the duties of innkeepers, or the\r\ngeneral conduct of business, and administered justice according\r\nto the Law Merchant with a sworn jury of foreigners or English or\r\nboth together, according to the case to be tried.[53] And since the\r\ngoverning body had general control beyond Calais itself over all\r\nEnglish merchants, not only in Bruges but throughout Flanders, while\r\nthey governed in England through their local officers, the power of the\r\nStaple extended far and wide and brought all the scattered merchants\r\nunder one general organization.[54] Formidable through their wealth and\r\npower, they could command the support of English kings and Burgundian\r\ndukes against rival traders. The profits to be made at Calais tempted\r\nthe landowners at home,[55] and all who were wealthy enough to pay\r\nthe required dues and fees flocked into their body, till the great\r\nassociation at last included all rich wool-growers and shut out only\r\nthe poor farmers and people of no account in the country. Their\r\nmonopoly was so complete, and their discipline so effective, that they\r\ncould absolutely dictate prices; and a judicious pooling system took\r\naway any temptation on the part of the members to break the ranks.[56]\r\nAt last against the original intentions of legislators they even got\r\ninto their own hands the carrying of the export trade, and so long as\r\nwool remained the chief export of England 80 per cent. of this trade\r\npassed through their hands.\r\n\r\nBut so far as the State was concerned all this elaborate system for the\r\nprotection of the wool-trade had simply grown out of the fundamental\r\nconception of the Staple as a fruitful source of supply for the royal\r\ntreasury; and this theory was carried out to its logical issues. A\r\nfixed sum was demanded from the merchants year by year which they had\r\nto pay whether their trade was good or bad; while in their mercantile\r\ndealings they were terribly hampered by a host of regulations issued as\r\nto the mint in Calais, and invented by financiers who from the middle\r\nof the fourteenth century were haunted by alarms as to a possible\r\ndearth of gold and silver, and arbitrarily used the Staple as a means\r\nof forcing the flow of precious metal into England.[57] Nor was the\r\ndrain of taxation at all times legal and regular. Merchants paid money\r\ndown for the protection and favour of the king in reiterated loans or\r\ngifts, whether free or forced. The Captain of Calais, as head of the\r\nonly standing army which the English kings then possessed, advanced a\r\nkind of public claim on the Staplers’ wealth for the security of his\r\nsoldiers’ pay; and the merchants had many a time good reason to tremble\r\nfor their wool, and might cry in vain for redress if their whole store\r\nwas confiscated to pay the soldiers’ arrears of two or three years, or\r\nif militant lords “shifted with the Staple of Calais” for £18,000 or so\r\nfor costs of war.[58]\r\n\r\nAll these burdens however could be borne so long as business prospered\r\nin their hands. If a Parliament like that of 1258, or a great statesman\r\nlike Simon de Montfort, urged that England should herself become an\r\nindependent and self-supporting centre of manufactures, these seemed\r\nas idle words to monopolists dealing in wool with command of the\r\nworld’s market, who saw no need to forsake their easy path to wealth\r\nat a moment when the growth of manufactures in the Netherlands opened\r\na vast market for English produce. In the time of Edward the Third it\r\nis said that 30,000 sacks of wool were shipped every year from English\r\nports.[59]\r\n\r\nBut before the reign of Edward had closed, the exporters of wool\r\nknew that they had fallen on evil days. Trade began to slip from\r\ntheir grasp. The revenue they paid from their profits to the King’s\r\nExchequer fell in the few years from 1391 to 1411 to one-fifth of its\r\nformer value,[60] and was still calculated at this melancholy fifth in\r\n1449. Instead of the thirty thousand sacks which they yearly counted in\r\nthe fourteenth century, they could not at the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury collect more than 8,624 sacks, and in the last year of Henry\r\nthe Eighth even this number had shrunk to under 5,000.[61] Taxes which\r\nlay comparatively lightly on them in happy days, fell as an intolerable\r\nburden when their warehouses lay empty, and their ranks were thinned\r\nby bankruptcy and desertion.[62] At the very moment when all England\r\nwas being rapidly turned into a land of sheep pastures for the endless\r\nproduction of wool, the great company of the wool traders was finally\r\nand irrevocably ruined.\r\n\r\nThe wool, in fact, was being sold at home, and out of the ruin of the\r\nmerchants of the Staple the cloth-makers sucked no small advantage.\r\nFor the great revolution in trade was rapidly being completed—the\r\nrevolution by which England was turned from being a country whose\r\nchief business was exporting wool into a country whose chief business\r\nwas exporting cloth.[63] The people had indeed long manufactured\r\nrough cloth for common use.[64] But during the reigns of the three\r\nEdwards the idea had constantly gained ground that by working up their\r\nown raw material[65] Englishmen might easily retain for themselves\r\nthe profits which foreigners had till now secured, and manufacturers\r\nwere undoubtedly doing a considerable export trade in the middle of\r\nthe fifteenth century.[66] Half a century later, in 1411, the very\r\nyear when the subsidy on wool fell to a fifth, broad-cloths are first\r\nmentioned in an Act of Parliament; and from this time they became\r\nthe chief cloths of trade. As though they had been for a while half\r\nforgotten by the Exchequer, the exporters of cloth found themselves\r\nfree from all subsidy tax and only obliged to pay to the indifferent\r\nauthorities tolls that amounted to less than two per cent. for natives\r\nand merchants of the Hanse occupied in the trade, and less than eight\r\nper cent. for aliens; and complacently measured this sum with the tolls\r\nof the Staplers—the thirty-three per cent. paid by merchants of the\r\nStaple, or seventy per cent. by all other traders,[67] a tax which\r\nperhaps explains why in 1424 Parliament had to forbid the carrying\r\nof sheep over sea to shear them there. The manufacturers, too, made\r\nalliance with the discontented wool-growers. A farmer who could\r\nsell his wool next door, did not trouble to send it with vexatious\r\nformalities over sea to Calais; and in course of time the cloth\r\nmerchants insisted upon laws which gave to them during certain seasons\r\nthe first choice of the wool before the Staplers were even allowed to\r\nenter the market.[68]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances trade grew apace. Carracks of Genoa carried\r\nEnglish cloths to the shores of the Black Sea; galleys of Venice\r\nfetched them to the pits of the Venetian dyers; merchants of the\r\nHanseatic League sold them in the fair of Novgorod; English traders\r\ntravelled with them to the inland markets of Prussia, and gave them in\r\nexchange for casks of herrings in Denmark. At the close of the century\r\nthe English Merchant Adventurers exported about 60,000 pieces of cloth\r\nyearly; and in the beginning of the sixteenth century the cloth dealers\r\nboasted that never before in the memory of man was so much cloth sold\r\nout of England. The 60,000 bales rose in 1509 to 84,789 pieces, and\r\nin 1547 to 122,354;[69] and the dealers claimed further gratitude\r\nand admiration of their country for the fact that they had “by their\r\nindustry” raised by a fifth the price demanded from the foreigner.[70]\r\nMeanwhile the manufacturer was also getting hold of the home market, as\r\nthe great religious corporations and landowners who had once provided\r\non their own estates for all local wants recognized the new condition\r\nof things, and instead of making cloth at home as of old, sent every\r\nyear far and wide across the country to the great clothing centres to\r\nbuy material for the household liveries,[71] seeking from one place the\r\ncoarse striped cloth of the old pattern and from another the goods of\r\nthe new fashion. The fine black copes of worsted were favourite gifts\r\nof benefactors to churches, and a patriotic Norfolk gentleman, after\r\nseeing a “tippet of fine worsted which is almost like silk,” decided to\r\n“make his doublet all worsted for worship of Norfolk.”[72]\r\n\r\nNor was the growth of manufacturing enterprise confined to the making\r\nof cloth. For a couple of centuries the iron trade had made of the\r\nWeald the Black Country of those days, and had stirred the Forest of\r\nDean with the din of its seventy-two moveable forges; and now, what\r\nwith the metals and what with the coal of the country, “the merchants\r\nof England maintain and say that the kingdom is of greater value under\r\nthe land than it is above.”[73] In the reign of Edward the Fourth when\r\nthere was a riot among the Mendip miners, and the Lord Chief Justice\r\nwent down to “set a concord and peace upon the forest of Mendip,” it is\r\nsaid ten thousand people appeared before him at the place of trial.[74]\r\nBut for all this miners could no longer keep pace with the demands of\r\nthe country, now that new industries on all sides required metal that\r\nhad once gone to supply the wants of the farmer only; and though stores\r\nwere brought from Sweden and Spain, the price of iron increased to\r\ndouble what it had been before the Plague.[75] Shipbuilders at the end\r\nof the fourteenth century were fitting out vessels for foreign as well\r\nas for English buyers. English gunsmiths began to send out of their\r\nworkshops brazen guns and bombards superior to anything made in France,\r\nand which were said to have given England its success in the French war\r\nunder Henry the Fifth.[76] A number of towns, big and little, boasted\r\nof their bell-foundries, as for example London, Salisbury, Norwich,\r\nGloucester, Bridport, and others.[77] The copper-workers of Dinant had\r\ntraded with England since the thirteenth century, and in the fourteenth\r\ncentury had an entrepôt at Blackwall; but in 1455 the founders set\r\nup their industry in England, stealing away secretly from Dinant to\r\nprofit by the cheaper labour and ready sale in this country.[78]\r\nFlemish experts taught to Englishmen the art of brickmaking, and native\r\nbuilders were setting up throughout the country the first brick houses\r\nthat had been seen in it since the departure of the Romans.[79] A whole\r\nseries of industrial experiments proclaimed the enthusiasm with which\r\nthe people accepted the challenge to secure for themselves the profits\r\nof foreign manufacturers. Artificers often more ambitious than skilful\r\ntried to establish a native industry of glass painting.[80] Instead\r\nof fetching from abroad carpets and the tapestry used for churches,\r\nmanufactories were set up at Ramsey,[81] whence came perhaps also some\r\nof the “counterfeit Arras” which adorned the humbler tradesmen’s homes.\r\nFrames “ordained and made for the making of silk” were at work;[82]\r\nlace-makers and ribbon weavers begged the protection of the government;\r\nand English workers sent into the market large quantities of the linen\r\ncalled Holland from its first home. The export of raw material fell\r\naltogether out of fashion. Traders no longer carried skins over sea\r\nundressed to be prepared by foreign labour, but had the work done by\r\nEnglish artizans at home. And whereas at the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury merchants brought beer from Prussia to England, at its close\r\nthey were carrying beer from London to Flanders.[83]\r\n\r\nWhat with the inland and the outland trade, riches gathered into the\r\nhands of the merchants with bewildering rapidity, and with results\r\nwhich alarmed good conservatives. A statute of Parliament passed\r\nin 1455 lamented the good old days when Norfolk and Norwich used to\r\nemploy only six or eight attorneys at the King’s Court, “in which\r\ntime great tranquillity reigned in the said city and counties.” This\r\n“tranquillity” was broken by the manufacturing and export trade, for\r\nnow a body of eighty or more lawyers busily frequented every fair and\r\nmarket and assembly, moving and inciting people to lawsuits, and while\r\nhaving nothing to live on but their attorneyship yet prospered so well\r\nthat a wise legislature had to order that Norfolk should henceforth as\r\nof old have only six attorneys and Norwich two.[84] Nor does it seem\r\nthat Norwich was exceptionally wicked, even though in Piers Ploughman\r\nCovetousness is represented with a “Norfolk nose,”[85] for about the\r\nsame time we read in Nottingham of twenty-four rolls written within\r\nand without with the pleas concerning trading questions of a single\r\nyear. The whole country in fact shared in traders’ profits from king to\r\npeasant. It is calculated that in the reign of Henry the Eighth English\r\nexports so far exceeded imports as to bring about £50,000 yearly into\r\nthe country, and the balance of trade inclined yet more strongly in\r\nfavour of England under Henry the Seventh.[86] Not only did the king\r\nlay up vast treasure, but the very goldsmiths’ shops in London were\r\nreported by a foreign traveller to contain more precious metals than\r\nall those of Rome, Milan, Florence, and Venice taken together.[87] So\r\nfar as the middle class is concerned evidence of accumulating wealth\r\nis to be found on every side, and the masses of the people in spite\r\nof the drain of war taxation shared in the general prosperity. In the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century Chief Justice Fortescue contrasts their\r\nstate with that of the French commons. “These drink water; they eat\r\napples with bread right brown made of rye. They eat no flesh, but if it\r\nbe right seldom a little lard, or of the entrails and heads of beasts\r\nslain for the nobles and merchants of the land. They wear no woollen\r\nbut if it be a poor coat under their outermost garment made of great\r\ncanvas and called a frock. Their hosen be of light canvas and pass not\r\ntheir knee, wherefore they be gartered and their thighs bare. Their\r\nwives and children go barefoot; they may in none otherwise live....\r\nTheir nature is wasted and the kind of them brought to nought. They go\r\ncrooked and be feeble, not able to fight nor to defend the realm; nor\r\nthey have weapon nor money to buy them weapon withal.... But blessed be\r\nGod, this land is ruled under a better law; and therefore the people\r\nthereof be not in such penury, nor thereby hurt in their persons but\r\nthey be wealthy and have all things necessary to the sustenance of\r\nnature.” “In France the people salt but little meat except their bacon,\r\nfor they would buy little salt” unless the king’s officers went round\r\nand forced every household to take a certain measure, such as they\r\nthought reasonable. But “this rule would be sore abhorred in England,\r\nas well by the merchants that he wont to have their freedom in buying\r\nand selling of salt as by the people that use much to salt their\r\nmeats.”[88]\r\n\r\nAn industrial revolution on such a scale as this brought a political\r\nrevolution in its train. The English population, says a writer of\r\nabout 1453, “consists of churchmen, nobles, and craftsmen, as well as\r\ncommon people.”[89] It was a novel and significant division. Traders\r\nand manufacturers took their places somewhat noisily beside their\r\nfellow politicians of older standing, filling the whole land till it\r\nseems for a moment as if nothing counted any more in English life save\r\nits middle class—a busy, hard, prosperous, pugnacious middle-class.\r\nSlowly emerging from its early obscurity, in this century it had\r\narrived at power definitely, ostentatiously, carrying a proud look\r\nand a high stomach, intent on its own affairs, heedless of the Court,\r\nregardless of ministers save when it had to bribe them, irreverent to\r\nthe noble, the “proud penniless with his painted sleeve,”[90] tolerant\r\nof ecclesiastics and monks only so long as they could be kept rigidly\r\nwithin their allotted religious functions.[91] Henceforth in the\r\nworkshop and the market-place home politics and foreign affairs were\r\ndiscussed from a new point of view—the interest of the trader and the\r\nmanufacturer; and the middle and working classes presently began to\r\nfling to the winds the old statecraft whose maxims had done service\r\nbefore their advent among the makers of the national policy.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of our foreign relations we see the drift of public\r\nthought and discussion reflected in a pamphlet by which one of the\r\nKing’s ministers, Moleyns, Bishop of Chichester, sought to appeal to\r\nthe popular imagination and define our right attitude to continental\r\npeoples. His Libel (or Little Book) of English Policy, published about\r\n1445, was clearly designed for the vulgar use.[92] Written, as the\r\ncommon taste of the day demanded, in rhyming form where the absence\r\nof poetic art and the inspiration of a plain common-sense constituted\r\na double claim on public attention, it made its frank appeal to the\r\nprejudice of the stall-holder in the market and of the craftsman who\r\nlived by making his homely English wares—men who saw in foreign\r\nproducts articles whose sinful extravagance could only be matched by\r\nthe worthlessness that distinguished all work not turned out by an\r\nEnglishman. With vigorous strokes the Bishop sketched the outlines of\r\nEngland’s trading interests with every nation in Europe, and at the end\r\nof each paragraph passionately drove home his moral. Laying hold of the\r\nfundamental axiom that the sole and undivided concern of England in all\r\nher foreign relations was the protection of her commerce, he maintained\r\nthat so long as she kept a firm hold on the narrow seas between Dover\r\nand Calais, she might rule the trade of the world. For there all\r\ncommerce from north to south or south to north had to pass through the\r\nstrait gate held by her sentinels on either side; so that while an\r\ninexorable fate drove the nations into her net, England safely hidden\r\nbehind her wall of defence, the stormy Channel, need have no care so\r\nlong as she looked well to her navy and kept it swift to seize her prey\r\nand strong to drive her enemies back from looking over the wall. At its\r\nvery outset the commercial society had thus its Cobden to preach after\r\nhis kind the doctrine of non-intervention and the kingdom of the seas.\r\n\r\nThe exponents of a new home policy pressed hard on the heels of the\r\nfounders of a new diplomacy. About thirty years after the Libel of\r\nEnglish Policy, another “Libel” was composed in imitation of the first\r\ntract.[93] Less pretentious and elaborate than the first, the new\r\npoem was probably the work of some person of less exalted rank, whose\r\nconverse had been with the working men of the country rather than\r\nwith merchants of London or peers of the realm and ministers of the\r\nKing, and who was far more troubled about our industrial policy at\r\nhome than our commercial policy abroad. His view of our position was\r\nalso finely optimistic. For, seeing that foreign traders were bound,\r\nwhether they would or no, to come to us either for wool or for cloth,\r\nand thus depended on England for one of the first necessaries of life,\r\nwe, who were put in this happy position of universal provider, were\r\nclearly “by God’s ordinance,” destined first to satisfy ourselves, and\r\nthen “to rule and govern all Christian kings,” and make paynims also\r\n“full tame”;[94] and so “of all people that be living on the ground”\r\nwere most bound to pray and to please God. The recognition of these\r\ninestimable blessings should bring of course its corresponding sense of\r\nour duty to sell our goods as dear as we could; to “restrain straitly”\r\nthe export of wool so that “the commons of this land might have work\r\nto the full”;[95] and in any case to export only the coarsest wool, on\r\nthe working of which the margin of profit must be small—but a fifth\r\nin fact of what might be made on good material. “The price is simple,\r\nthe cost is never the less; they that worked such wool in wit be like\r\nan ass.” Above all, the working men must be protected by law in the\r\nconditions of their labour, so that “their poor living and adversity\r\nmight be altered into wealth, riches, and prosperity,” and that for\r\nthe profit of the whole realm. The growth of industry was already\r\nbringing in its train a modern theory that “the whole wealth of the\r\nbody of the realm riseth out of the labours and works of the common\r\npeople.... Surely the common weal of England must rise out of the works\r\nof the common people.”[96]\r\n\r\nFrom this time therefore the policy of England was to be the policy\r\nof a great industrial state. But the new way on which its people\r\nwere thus striving to enter was not to be a way of good-will at home\r\nor of harmony with the nations. Merchant and burgher might remain,\r\nas they did, absolutely indifferent to all schemes of mere military\r\naggrandizement[97] such as the conquest of France, so that after the\r\ntaking of Bordeaux by the French in 1445 not a single cry was raised\r\nfor the recovery of our lost possessions; and they might rather look\r\nfor the extension of their trade to the bold enterprising genius\r\nof trading companies and pirates exulting in freedom from royal\r\ninterference and military restrictions, and only calling on the State\r\nfor diplomatic aid in the case where this proved convenient for the\r\nwinning of a commercial treaty. But the secret of peace was not yet\r\nfound, nor was the settlement of industrial frontiers to prove simpler\r\nthan the definition of military borders.\r\n\r\nFor as yet England had wakened no jealousies simply because she had\r\nnever been a competitor with other nations; but obvious trouble\r\nlay in wait for her people so soon as they were fairly swept into\r\nthe commercial struggle of the Continent, and introduced by their\r\nmanufactures to their first real trade disputes. The weaver of the\r\nNetherlands, for example, had gladly welcomed the English trader as\r\nthe inexhaustible provider of his raw material; but it was another\r\nmatter when the Englishman came as a rival manufacturer laden with\r\nbales of cloth, grudging the old supply of wool, and setting up stalls\r\nin Flemish markets to seduce away his ancient customers. The Flemish\r\ntowns had seen an end to their prosperity, and towns in such a case\r\nwere bitter in negotiations with their rivals.[98] Bruges which in the\r\nthirteenth century had 40,000 looms, was at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury offering citizenship at a mere trifle to draw back inhabitants\r\nto its deserted streets; Ypres, which in 1408 had a population of\r\nfrom 80,000 to 100,000, and from 3,000 to 4,000 clothworkers, had in\r\n1486 only from 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants, and twenty-five to thirty\r\ncloth-factories; and in Ghent matters were little better. Against all\r\nthe misery of a century of slow death in Flanders—a misery on which\r\nthe English weaver throve and fattened—the doomed manufacturers set up\r\nhasty barriers on this side and on that, taxes and tolls and municipal\r\nordinances and State decrees to shut English cloth out of Flanders,\r\nwhich were met by angry English rejoinders forbidding Flemish cloth\r\nin the English markets. Similar difficulties followed everywhere the\r\nappearance of the English trader with his goods. The Hanseatic League\r\ndrove him out of Denmark, and the Teutonic Order banished him from\r\nPrussia. Moreover while disputes of manufacturers kept the North in a\r\ntumult, commercial quarrels disturbed the South, and English merchant\r\nvessels met the Genoese or the Venetians in the seas of the Levant\r\nto fight for the carrying trade of the Mediterranean. No limit was\r\nset to the pirate wars that raged from Syria to Iceland till a great\r\nstatesman, Henry the Seventh, made his splendid attempt to discover\r\nthrough international treaties the means of securing a settled order\r\nfor the new commercial state.\r\n\r\nNor was the question of home politics more easy of solution. Under the\r\nsteady pressure of public feeling the government was gradually forced\r\nout of the early simplicity of its view of regulating commerce as a\r\nfinancial expedient in aid of the Treasury, and began to concern itself\r\nanxiously about the protection of industry in the interests of the\r\ncommunity. Cloth manufacturers in particular entered on a period of\r\nprotected security such as the Staplers had never known, when kings\r\nbecame the nursing fathers of their trade, and its prosperity was\r\nconsidered an absorbing charge to the government. But when Parliament\r\nbegan in 1463 (almost the very year in which the second “Libel”\r\nappeared) to concern itself very actively with industrial problems,[99]\r\nthe question of trade legislation had already become extremely complex\r\nand difficult. As soon as the village weaver began to make cloth for\r\nthe Prussian burgher or the trader of the Black Sea instead of for his\r\nnext door neighbour, the old conditions of his trade became absolutely\r\nimpossible. The whole industry was before long altogether re-organized\r\nboth from the commercial and the manufacturing side. The exporting\r\nmerchants, as we shall see later, drew together into a new and powerful\r\nassociation known as the Merchant Adventurers. Meanwhile the army of\r\nworkmen at home was broken up into specialized groups of spinners,\r\nweavers, carders, fullers, shearers, and dyers. The seller was more and\r\nmore sharply separated from the maker of goods. Managers and middlemen\r\norganized the manufacture and made provisions for its distribution and\r\nsale. The clothier provided the raw material, gave out the wool to be\r\nmade up, and sold again to the draper.[100] And the draper “lived like\r\na gentleman,” and sold to the big public, despising the lower forms\r\nof trade. Old-fashioned economists and timid conservatives looked on\r\naghast at the accelerating changes, and declared that the country was\r\nbeing brought to certain ruin by the reckless race of its people to\r\nforsake handicrafts or the production of wealth, and press wholesale\r\ninto the ranks of merchants or mere distributors.\r\n\r\nWith this division of labour and the quickened contest for profits,\r\nthere started into life rival interests more than enough to break\r\nup the whole community into groups of warring factions. The “upper\r\nclasses” generally, statesmen, treasury officials, nobles, the greater\r\nproprietors lay and ecclesiastical—in fact all the wealthy owners of\r\nflocks who could enter the company of the Staplers and share their\r\nprofits—desired an abundant export of wool; while the small farmers\r\nand the yeomen, shut out by poverty from the association, and bitterly\r\nhostile to the wealthy monopolist, sided with the townsfolk to whom\r\nvisions of wealth had first dawned in the manufacturing industries\r\nand the export of cloth, and who would gladly have kept all the wool\r\nof the country at home.[101] Merchants and manufacturers had their\r\nown special controversy, for while the foreign trader was boasting of\r\nhis energy in raising the price of cloth, the middlemen and makers\r\nat home, whose whole interest lay in rapid sales, complained that\r\npeople in the Netherlands would no longer buy English goods owing to\r\nthe increased cost, and that the English towns were thus brought to\r\ndestitution.[102] Moreover the great London merchants were making a\r\ndetermined effort to force the whole foreign trade of England through\r\ntheir warehouses in London, and to shut all channels of commerce save\r\nthose provided by themselves;[103] and demanded that all cloth for\r\nthe Netherlands, that is practically one-third of all the cloth then\r\nexported, must be carried by the maker to London, and there sold, as\r\nwas averred, to the exporting merchants either for credit or below\r\ncost price.[104] Here of course they came into conflict with the local\r\ndealers who wanted frequent and convenient markets for their wares,\r\nand liberty to make their own bargain with foreign buyers visiting\r\ntheir town; for to the clothier this question of distribution was\r\nall-important, since it was in vain for him to increase production by\r\nmachinery, or by the improved organization of labour, or by division of\r\ntoil among groups of skilled artizans, unless he could find his profit\r\nin a corresponding developement of the means of sale. The exporting\r\nmerchants had also a quarrel with the artizans, who naturally desired\r\nto keep the dressing and finishing of cloth in their own hands, while\r\nthe merchants insisted on the advantages of a free trade in undressed\r\ncloth; in their judgement the cloth-dressers, seeking but their\r\n“singular and private wealth,” forgot that more men lived by making\r\nand selling cloth than by dressing it, and that therefore the rapid\r\ndevelopement of exports by carrying out material in the rough to be\r\nfinished in the Netherlands was really for the enriching of the whole\r\nrealm.[105] These same dealers, however, looked more leniently on the\r\n“singular and private wealth” that went into their own pockets through\r\nthe profits of the export trade, and also found themselves set at\r\nvariance with the big public of consumers who were always anxiously\r\non the watch against the raising of prices. At times the manufacturer\r\nhad his grievances against the municipal authorities, whenever he\r\nfound himself worried and fettered by the traditional wisdom of Town\r\nCouncils, who for a variety of reasons of their own wanted to keep the\r\nultimate control over his trade so as to draw a profit for the town.\r\nLastly, the working class had begun to feel difficulties springing\r\nfrom the new methods of industrial organization, and troubles about\r\nwages and prices and the relation of employer to employed assailed\r\nthe authorities both at Westminster and in the municipal councils.\r\nArtificers of all kinds, it was constantly declared, could no longer\r\nlive of their occupation and were in great misery;[106] in fact, to\r\njudge by preambles to Statutes, and the loud complaints as to his\r\ncondition, the working man believed himself to be in such bad case as\r\nto need all the aid of the State to keep him supplied with employment.\r\n\r\nThis old industrial revolution in short brought with it difficulties\r\nwhich bear to us the familiar look of our own constant and persevering\r\nvisitors—visitors that force their entrance at every breach in the\r\naccustomed order by which trade is fenced round, and that appear as\r\nthe unwelcome escort of every new form of industrial competition.\r\nMoreover, to add to the troubles of the mediæval legislator, the\r\nconsumer of those days was always insisting on his vested right to the\r\nfirst consideration of the government, as the ultimate dictator for\r\nwhose benefit the whole colossal structure of trade had been reared,\r\nand by whose approval alone it was allowed to remain at that ambitious\r\nelevation. With every fresh enterprise of manufacturer or merchant,\r\nthe problem with which the law-makers had to deal became more subtle\r\nand complex. Driven hither and thither by the new conflict of public\r\nopinion and the passion of rival interests, baffled by the insoluble\r\nproblem of how to frame laws which should benefit equally all the\r\nclaimants for its aid, the government hesitatingly felt its way along\r\nan ill-defined path, veering from side to side according to the\r\ndirection of the last impelling force. Even Edward the Fourth had no\r\nfixed policy of protection, and passed laws now on this side, now on\r\nthat, as the imperious necessity of the moment seemed to demand.\r\n\r\nBut with a rapidly increasing trade, and with a House of Commons\r\nthree-fourths of whose members were burghers personally concerned\r\nin these questions, it was impossible to stand still; and the new\r\nindustrial legislation gradually became the expression not of the\r\nautocratic rule of kings, but of a self-conscious government of\r\nthe people.[107] A long series of Statutes illustrates this great\r\nexperiment. The new protection devised by burghers and merchants\r\nfor the fostering of industry was altogether different from the old\r\nprotection devised by a Court mainly occupied with the problem of\r\nre-filling an empty Treasury. The English manufacturer and the English\r\nworking man were its recognized charge, and in their interest no\r\nmeasure was considered too heroic and no detail too insignificant,\r\nwhether the matter in hand was the closing of English markets to a\r\nwhole people, or the decision of how big a piece of leather it might be\r\nwell in the interest of the shoemaking trade to allow the cobbler to\r\nbuy for the patching of an old boot. All native trades were “protected”\r\nby laws which declared that none of the wares which Englishmen could\r\nmanufacture at home might be imported from foreign parts, and that\r\nnone of the raw material they used might be carried out unwrought, or\r\neven half finished, to be worked up abroad. The whole people, save\r\na few of the “great estates” and mighty men, must go simply clad in\r\nhonest goods of English make, and so save themselves from waste, and\r\nEnglish workers from poverty. As to the long dispute about admitting\r\nforeigners to trade in England, in which the King and the people had\r\never been in strong opposition, that matter was now more and more\r\nregulated according to the desires of the traders. England ceased to\r\nbe the acquiescent host of guests who, in the vulgar opinion, came\r\nto thrive and fatten on her wealth; and a determined resistance was\r\ndeclared against the competition of strangers, till the Hanseatic\r\ntrader scarcely dared show his face outside the strong walls of his\r\nSteel-yard citadel, and the Lombard vainly struggled to protect his\r\nlast privileges from the assaults of his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe theory of State protection of industry grew fast, and by the time\r\nof Henry the Seventh its triumph was complete, and the foundations\r\nof a new national policy were firmly laid—a policy which was to be\r\nlargely guided by industrial interests and to represent the claims\r\nof an elaborate industrial organization established by law and built\r\ninto vast proportions by international agreement. The new relation\r\nof a sovereign to his people in such a State was seen at the end of\r\nthe century in the first peaceful king of England whose subjects had\r\nsubmitted to his rule, the only English monarch till then who had\r\nnot been a strong leader in war and who had yet escaped murder or\r\nimprisonment at the hands of his people. It has been the singular\r\nmisfortune of one of our greatest rulers, Henry the Seventh, to be\r\nthe first sovereign of the modern pattern who ruled over Englishmen,\r\nand his memory has in consequence come down to us shorn of all the\r\nconventional glory that tradition had until then declared proper\r\nto royalty. He has remained in history as we see him in one of\r\nhis portraits, a dim obscure figure, sadly looking out from the\r\nbackground of a canvas where the big blustering figure of his son,\r\nset squarely in front, seems to elbow all virtue save his own out of\r\nrecognized existence. But in the delicate, careworn, refined face\r\nwith its suggestion of unrecorded self-effacement, in the penetrating\r\nintelligence devoted to the apprehending of the new problems and the\r\ninfinite labour spent in solving them, in the inscrutable acquiescence\r\nwith which, “loving to seal up his own dangers,”[108] he carried the\r\nburdens that were henceforth to fall to the lot of kings, and the\r\nunflinching resolution of his methods, we recognize a new type of royal\r\ndignity, and measure the work demanded of rulers who saw the power of\r\nmere personal dominion founded on force gradually passing from their\r\nhands, and in the changing order of the world were called to take up\r\nthe leadership of the new commonwealth that was to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nA FRENCH proverb of the twelfth century tells us what the world thought\r\nin old days of the origin and uses of a navy. “Point de marine sans\r\npelerinages,” men said, seeing in pious penitents its means of support,\r\nand in the shrines of St. James or St. Peter or the Holy Sepulchre its\r\ndestinations. Trade in those days avoided the way of the ocean, and\r\nfollowed the well-known land routes across the heart of Europe, and\r\nwhere the land came to an end took the very shortest way over the water\r\nto the next point of solid earth.\r\n\r\nAnd slowly as commerce by sea developed in Europe it developed yet more\r\nslowly among the English. All goods that came to them from abroad were\r\ncarried to their shores by powerful confederations of foreign merchants\r\nwho controlled the great continental trade routes of the north-west.\r\nThe “men of the Empire” or the Hanse of Cologne, masters of the\r\nhighway of the Rhine and of Cologne, the great seaport of the Empire,\r\ncommanded the whole Eastern trade which then for the most part passed\r\nthrough Germany.[109] The Flemish Hanse of London,[110] which included\r\nall the great towns of Picardy and Flanders, and perhaps at one time\r\neven Paris itself, carried over sea the wares that were gathered from\r\nhalf of Europe to the great fairs of Champagne. Through these two great\r\ncompanies England first exchanged her wool for certain necessaries such\r\nas salt and fish and iron and wood, and for a few luxuries such as\r\nspices and silks from the Levant.\r\n\r\nAnd even when commerce swept beyond the narrow seas and passed out\r\nof the hands of the men of Cologne and the Flemish Hanse, it was not\r\nEnglishmen who took their place. If the waterway of the Rhine was\r\nforsaken of half its trade as merchants of Northern Italy abandoned\r\nthe old route across Europe, and instead of sending their goods to\r\nthe warehouses of Cologne despatched fleets through the Straits of\r\nGibraltar to the ports of the Channel and to Bruges; if the fairs of\r\nChampagne languished when armies encamped on its plains and turned\r\nthem into battle-fields, and the Flemish Hanse of London slowly sank\r\ninto insignificance—it was only to make way for other competitors of\r\nforeign blood. Commerce with the East through the Mediterranean and\r\nthe Bay of Biscay was seized by the ships of Florence and Genoa and\r\nVenice.[111] The towns of the German Ocean and the Baltic gathered\r\nunder the banner of Lübeck into a new Hanseatic League[112] which broke\r\nthe supremacy of Cologne, claimed the whole carrying trade of the\r\nNorthern seas, and opened a new line of communication with the Levant.\r\nNovgorod became the centre of the Baltic trade, as Alexandria was the\r\ncentre of the Mediterranean traffic, and the merchants of the Teutonic\r\nHanse offered to the English trader the silks and drugs of the East,\r\nwith skins and hemp and timber of Novgorod, and the metals of Bohemia\r\nand Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean merchant was the great minister to the growing luxury\r\nof mediæval England. “The estates and lords of the realm” and bishops\r\nand prelates and parish priests bought from him cloth of gold, rich\r\nbrocades, vestments of white damask powdered with gold of Venice,[113]\r\nand precious work of goldsmiths and jewellers, new-fashioned glass,\r\nand many other fine things—articles that “might be forborn for dear\r\nand deceivable,” grumbled the English dealer in homely goods of\r\nnative manufacture. The whole luxurious traffic down to the “apes\r\nand japes and marmosettes tailed, nifles, trifles, that little have\r\navailed,”[114] roused the bitter jealousy of the home trader; and even\r\nstatesmen foretold with alarm the perils that must come to the nation\r\nfrom a commerce which filled the land with fancy baubles and vanities,\r\nand carried away in exchange the precious wealth of the people, their\r\ncloth and wool and tin, sucking the thrift out of the land as the wasp\r\nsucks honey from the bee. But in spite of the hostility of English\r\ndealers needy kings anxious to win favour with the great banking\r\ncompanies of Italy diligently encouraged the trade; and (always in\r\nconsideration of adequate tolls for privileges) freed merchants\r\nwho came from beyond the Straits from the vexatious control of the\r\nStaple;[115] allowed their vessels to put into port undisturbed at\r\nSouthampton instead of being forced to go to Calais; and their agents\r\nto travel through the country and buy and sell at will.\r\n\r\nIt was Florence which in the first half of the fourteenth century took\r\nthe lead in the trade of the Mediterranean with England,[116] and whose\r\nmerchants lent to Edward the Third the money which alone enabled him\r\nto carry on the war with France. But when Edward declared himself\r\nunable to pay his debts and repudiated the whole of the Florentine\r\nloans ruin fell on the city; its trade was paralyzed, and commercial\r\ndisasters ended in political revolution. Bankers of Lübeck took the\r\nplace of its financiers as the Rothschilds of the mediæval world; and\r\nship-masters of Genoa seized the commerce which fell from its hands.\r\nThough the winning of the port of Leghorn in 1421 brought a fresh\r\noutburst of trading activity to Florence,[117] though its merchants\r\nestablished depots and banks and commercial settlements in all the\r\ngreat towns of the North, though cargoes of wool were again shipped to\r\nits harbour (one English merchant alone in 1437 selling to an agent of\r\nthe Albertine Company wool to the value of almost £12,000),[118] the\r\nsupremacy of the Republic in the Mediterranean trade was never restored.\r\n\r\nFor its great competitors, Genoa and Venice, were now fairly in the\r\nfield. Through their station on the Black Sea the Genoese held until\r\nthe Turkish conquest the chief market in the East for European cloth;\r\nand their fleets laden with cloth of gold, silk and spices of the\r\nLevant, with alum and mastick from the subject islands of Chios and\r\nPhocœa, with the woad of Toulouse, and the wines of Provence, sailed\r\nto Southampton to exchange their cargoes for English cloth, which\r\nthey sometimes carried back direct to the Black Sea, and sometimes\r\ntook on to sell at the Flemish markets, and so make a double profit\r\non their journey.[119] For their world-wide business the Bank of St.\r\nGeorge was founded at Genoa in 1407, with a system of credit notes of\r\nacknowledgement for money deposited which could be transferred from\r\nhand to hand.\r\n\r\nThe great galleys of Venice, however, were formidable rivals of the\r\ncarracks of Genoa. For Venice, hidden away in the Adriatic, with\r\nnothing of its own save salt to offer, showed in perhaps a higher\r\ndegree than any other Italian State what might be achieved by a lavish\r\nsystem of State protection.[120] It was the State that built its\r\nmerchant fleets; the State that leased out the vessels every year to\r\nthe highest bidders for trading purposes; the State that ordered the\r\nconduct of their business for the greatest public wealth; the State\r\nthat protected them from competition by forbidding its citizens to\r\nsend out their spices by the overland route, or to take in cloth from\r\nEngland that had not been carried in Venetian galleys by long sea.\r\nBy the authority of its government Venice had been made the emporium\r\nof the Mediterranean, and Italian traders obediently carried cloths\r\nor tin or bales of skins from England to Venice, and from Venice to\r\nCorfu. Fortune favoured the most astute among her wooers, and showered\r\non Venice the coveted blessings of trade. Her ships travelled far, and\r\nItalian merchants who had once been only known in England as financial\r\nagents employed by the Papal Court to collect the tribute due to Rome,\r\nnow flocked to the island on business of a very different character.\r\nThe harbour of Southampton was crowded with galleys, in which cunning\r\ntailors sat day and night cutting the bales of material bought into\r\ngarments, so as to save the export dues on cloth.[121] In the time of\r\nRichard the Second a Genoese merchant who had leased the castle as a\r\nstorehouse for his wares proposed to the King to make of Southampton\r\nthe greatest trading port of the west, and he might well have carried\r\nout his promise if the London merchants had not prudently sent a\r\nmessenger to murder him at his own door.[122] Notwithstanding the\r\ninhospitable and grudging welcome given by London itself the Lombards\r\nfound means by the King’s help to maintain a thriving settlement, and\r\nin the fifteenth century the Venetian Consuls gathered letters for the\r\nregular mail to Venice once every month.[123]\r\n\r\nWhat the Venetians were to the commerce of the Mediterranean that\r\nthe merchants of the Hanseatic League were to the commerce of the\r\nBaltic and the German Ocean. A double strength had been given to the\r\nconfederation of towns which Lübeck had drawn under its banner by\r\nits union with the Teutonic Order—an order which had originated in\r\nBremen and Lübeck and then settled on the Baltic to create the trading\r\nprosperity of Danzig and Elbing. These Prussian cities, while they\r\nowned the Grand Master of the Order of Teutonic Knights as their feudal\r\nchief, were still dependent on Lübeck.[124] And with them were joined\r\na multitude of towns so imposing in their very numbers alone that\r\nwhen the ambassadors of the Hanseatic League in England in 1376 were\r\nasked for a list of the members who made up their vast association,\r\nthey answered scornfully that surely even they themselves could not be\r\nsupposed to remember the countless names of towns big and little in all\r\nkingdoms in whose name they spoke.[125] Under the strangely diverse\r\nlordship of Kings, Dukes, Margraves, Counts, Barons, or Archbishops,\r\nthey found a link in their common union in the Holy Roman Empire,\r\nand ever counted England, cut off from that great commonwealth, as a\r\n“foreign” nation.[126]\r\n\r\nIn war or in commercial negotiations this mighty confederation, with\r\nits members disciplined to act together as one body, dealt proudly\r\nas a nation on equal terms with other peoples, and in the strength\r\nof its united corporation it was in fact a far more formidable force\r\nthan the jealous and isolated Republics of the South. Denmark was\r\nlaid at its feet by a triumphant war. Norway was held in complete\r\nsubjection. It forced the English traders in the North Sea to bow to\r\nits policy and fight at its bidding. So powerful was the League in the\r\nfourteenth century, that when Edward the Third had ruined the banks of\r\nFlorence it was the merchants of Lübeck who became his money-lenders;\r\nthey were made the farmers of the English wool-tax; they rented the\r\nmines of the northern counties and the tin-works of Cornwall.[127]\r\nThe whole carrying trade of the northern seas lay in their hands.\r\nIt was vessels of the Hanse that sailed from Hull or from Boston to\r\nBergen with English wares and brought back cargoes of salt fish;[128]\r\nthat fetched iron from Sweden, and wine from the Rhine vineyards, and\r\noranges and spices and foreign fruits from Bruges; and that carried out\r\nthe English woollen cloths to Russia and the Baltic ports, and brought\r\nback wood, tin, potash, skins, and furs. Within the strong defences of\r\ntheir Steel-yard[129] on the banks of the Thames by London Bridge, the\r\nadvance guard of the League lived under a sort of military discipline,\r\nand held their own by force of the King’s protection against the hatred\r\nof London traders and burghers, which now and then burst into violent\r\nriots.\r\n\r\nThus throughout the fourteenth century it was strangers who held the\r\ncarrying trade to England along the two great commercial routes—the\r\npassage by Gibraltar to the harbours of Italy and thence to Alexandria,\r\nand the passage by the Sound to the Baltic ports and so to Novgorod.\r\nAll the profits of transit as of barter were secured by alien dealers\r\nwho travelled from village to village throughout the country in search\r\nof wool or cloth to freight the foreign vessels that lay in every\r\nharbour—vessels bigger and better built for commerce than any of which\r\nEngland could boast.[130] Moreover, the English government was content\r\nto have it so, and Kings who wanted to build up alliances for their\r\nforeign wars, or to replenish their failing treasury at home, in all\r\ncommercial regulations showed their favour mainly to foreign traders\r\nand left the native shipowner to do as best he could for himself. Once,\r\nindeed, in the reign of Richard the Second, a solitary attempt was\r\nmade to encourage the shipping industry, and the first Navigation Act\r\npassed in England ordered “that none of the King’s liege people do from\r\nhenceforth ship any merchandise in going out or coming within the realm\r\nof England but only in ships of the King’s liegance.”[131] This Act,\r\nhowever, after the fashion of the time, was only to be in force for a\r\nfew months; and after very brief experience Parliament wisely decided\r\nthat the law need only be obeyed when “the ships in the parts where the\r\nsaid merchants shall happen to dwell be found able and sufficient ...\r\nand otherwise it shall be lawful to hire other ships convenient.”[132]\r\nWith this the experiment of State protection came to an end for the\r\nnext century; and against the great confederations and State-protected\r\nnavies of the Continent English merchants were left to wage singly as\r\nbest they could their private and adventurous war.\r\n\r\nEnglish shipping, indeed, so far as it existed at all, may be said to\r\nhave existed in spite of the law. There was no navy whatever in any\r\nnational sense. A few balingers[133] and little coasting vessels lay in\r\nthe various ports—some of them belonging to private merchants, some\r\nto the town communities—and when the King wanted ships for the public\r\nservice, whether it was to fish for herrings for his household or to\r\nfight the French, he simply demanded such vessels as he needed in any\r\nharbour, kept them and their crews waiting on his will for weeks or\r\nmonths, sent them wherever he chose, and laid all costs on the town or\r\nthe owner’s shoulders.[134] Moreover, the unlucky merchant forfeited\r\nhis ship to the Crown for any accident that might happen on it—if a\r\nman died, or fell overboard, or if it struck another vessel or touched\r\na rock. The masters might suffer ruin, or in mere self-defence give up\r\nthe owning of ships, and the sailors might forsake the sea and turn\r\nto other occupations to escape being impressed for war: government\r\ninterference to regulate wages only sent men to take service at more\r\ntempting pay in foreign boats.[135] We cannot wonder that towards\r\nthe end of the fourteenth century it seems to have been thought more\r\nprofitable under these conditions to make ships for others than to\r\nown them, and that builders were selling their vessels to aliens, and\r\nthese aliens “by reason of the excessive profits thence arising have\r\noften sold the same to the enemies of the realm.”[136] Henry the Fifth,\r\nindeed, proposed to build up a royal navy, but his plans were cut short\r\nby his death and his ships sold under Henry the Sixth, and matters went\r\non as before.[137]\r\n\r\nEnglish traders, however, did not sit down idly to wait for State\r\nprotection.[138] Already in the middle of the fourteenth century a new\r\nlife was stirring in the seaports, and before long every one of them\r\nbegan to send its contingent to the host that went out for the conquest\r\nof the sea. Towns big and little were creating or strengthening their\r\nfleets, made up either of the “common barges” of the community, or\r\nthe private ships of their trading companies. Shipbuilding was dear\r\nin England from the want of wood in the country as well as of iron\r\nsuitable for the purpose, and cost, if we may believe a contemporary\r\nobserver, twice as much as in France.[139] So poor communities\r\nlike Lydd that could not afford big ventures made shift by hiring\r\nvessels from Britanny, Sandwich, or London, and fitting them out as\r\neconomically as might be, with an old wine-pipe sawed in half to serve\r\nfor a bread barrel.[140] On the other hand, prosperous ports like Lynn\r\nadded large sums year after year to the town budget for shipping.[141]\r\nA far poorer place, Romney, spent £73 on its common barge in 1381; in\r\n1396 another was bought and fitted out for £82; and a third in 1400 at\r\nover £40; while a few years later yet another ship was procured for\r\nthe Bordeaux trade. These vessels sailed to Scotland and Newcastle\r\nand Norfolk and the ports of the Southern coasts; or to Ireland for\r\nwood, to Amiens for sea-coal, to Britanny for salt, to Flanders for the\r\nwares of the Levant, to Southern France for cargoes of wine, and oil,\r\nand wood. In 1400 “the new barge” carried forty-two tuns of wine from\r\nRochelle; in 1404 it brought forty tuns besides oil and wood, and in a\r\nlater voyage carried fifty-six tuns.[142] Everywhere the trading temper\r\nlaid hold upon the people. In Rye, where the inhabitants had been wont\r\nto pay their yearly oblations punctually on the 8th of September, there\r\ncame a time when so many of them were abroad, some attending fairs,\r\nsome fishing in remote seas, “that Divine worship is not then observed\r\nby them as it ought to be, and the due oblations are withheld and\r\nhardly ever paid;” and the day of offering had to be changed.[143]\r\n\r\nThe more important side of the movement, however, was the growth of\r\nprivate enterprise as shown in the associations of merchants formed\r\nin all the bigger towns for trading purposes. Already in the time of\r\nRichard the Second there was a “Fellowship of Merchants” in Bristol\r\nwho directed the whole foreign trade and the import of foreign\r\nmerchandise, and who even then did business on a very considerable\r\nscale, for when in 1375 Bristol ships laden with salt were captured\r\nand burnt in the Channel the losses were set down at £17,739. Before\r\nfifty years were over their trading vessels were known in every sea\r\nfrom Syria to Iceland. The richer merchants built up by degrees little\r\nfleets of ten or twelve vessels varying from 400 to 900 tons; and one\r\nof them, William Cannynges, an ancestor of Lord Canning, who in 1461\r\nhad ten ships afloat (one _The Nicholas of the Tower_ from whence came\r\nSuffolk’s headsman), employed 800 seamen and 100 carpenters, masons,\r\nand artificers.[144] Nor was Bristol singular in its activity. The\r\nGuild of Merchants at Lynn rivalled that of York. “With the Divine\r\nassistance, and the help of divers of the King’s subjects,” John\r\nTaverner of Hull in 1449 built a great “carrack” on the scale of the\r\nmighty ships of Genoa and Venice. Far and wide the movement spread till\r\nthe brief tale of 169 merchants which had been counted up by Edward\r\nthe Third when he wanted to borrow money from them, expanded towards\r\nthe close of the fifteenth century into a company of more than 3,000\r\ntraders engaged in sea-commerce alone.[145]\r\n\r\nFrom whatever town they came these traders with foreign ports were all\r\nalike known to the men of the fourteenth century by one significant\r\nname—the Adventurers. For since there was but one protected industry\r\nin England, the Staple, every merchant who was not a Stapler was a\r\nfree Adventurer. All trade that lay outside the Staple was for his\r\nwinning.[146] Bound to no place or company or government or laws, he\r\nwas left to discover for himself a corner in the world’s market, and\r\nto protect himself on sea and land. A perfectly indifferent State gave\r\nhim no help in his first ventures to become the carrier of English\r\ncommerce, and vouchsafed no encouragement to shipbuilder or master\r\nby offers of special favours or grants of reduced tolls on a first\r\nvoyage.[147] He sailed out of port into a sea of peril. Pirates of all\r\nnations, Vitalien Brüder in the Baltic and the North Sea, Likedelers\r\nof Calais,[148] Breton cruisers, vigorous monopolists of the Hanse,\r\noutraged merchants of the South burning for vengeance, lay in wait\r\non every quarter of the horizon. In 1395 Norfolk traders were robbed\r\nof £20,000 “by the Queen’s men of Denmark, the which was an undoing\r\nto many of the merchants of Norfolk for evermore afterwards;”[149]\r\nand frequent and piteous were the complaints that went up to the\r\nPrivy Council from English shippers begging redress and protection\r\nas outrage followed outrage.[150] But a State which was without any\r\norganized naval force was powerless to establish order. Whether\r\nit gave the charge of keeping the peace on the high seas to the\r\nmerchants themselves, or to the Staplers, or by special commission\r\nto the Admirals[151] of the coast, or to a committee of lords, or to\r\nthe foremost among the offenders, the Captain of Calais himself, its\r\nexperiments were equally vain. In self-protection town barges and\r\nmerchants’ ships sailed in companies under an admiral of their own\r\nchoosing, armed to the teeth like little men of war against the enemy,\r\nand even carrying cannon on board as early as 1407, before any kind\r\nof hand-guns had been invented.[152] If when disaster overtook them\r\ntheir masters appealed for compensation to the government they did\r\nnot wait solely on the State for redress; and English rulers seem to\r\nhave been often less perplexed to bring a remedy to their sufferings\r\nthan to conciliate the great foreign confederations whose anger had\r\nbeen roused by their swift and violent retaliation. There were indeed\r\nprobably no more formidable pirates afloat than these English cruisers\r\nthemselves, for they were hard fighters who took a prompt revenge; and\r\namong foreigners at all events they won the reputation of using their\r\nshipping for no other purpose than to harass all trade of other peoples\r\nin the narrow seas, and “obstruct the utility of commerce throughout\r\nall Christendom.”[153]\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions we can easily understand that throughout the\r\ncentury whenever the question of the English navy emerges in Rolls\r\nof Parliament and Statutes and official statements, we have a\r\ncontemporary picture drawn in the gloomiest colours.[154] Statesmen\r\nheap up details to show how badly the merchant service fulfils\r\nits vague functions as a royal navy. Ship-owners bring their loud\r\ncomplainings to prove how ill they have been used by the State. Each\r\nside burns to waken the other to a sense of its duty, and talk of the\r\ndecay of English power by sea might be pressed into the service of\r\neither, while the loss of Southern France and the temporary blow which\r\nthis gave to English shipping was used to point the argument on both\r\nsides. The sea was our wall of defence, it was said; but now the enemy\r\nwas on the wall and where was our old might of ships and sailors? The\r\nvery Dutch were laughing at our impotence, and when they insolently\r\njested at the ships engraved on the coins of Edward the Third and asked\r\nwhy we did not engrave a sheep on them instead, the pun was felt to\r\ninflict a deep wound on the national honour.[155]\r\n\r\nSuch judgements, however, should be read in the light of the records\r\nwhich tell us what English ships afloat upon the sea were actually\r\ndoing in those days. For at this very time the unofficial Englishman\r\nseems to have been boasting that his people possessed a greater number\r\nof fine and powerful ships than any other nation, so that they were\r\n“kings of the sea;”[156] and if the boast was a little premature\r\nit lay on the whole nearer to the truth. Even now the fleets of the\r\nAdventurers were going forth to the conquest of the seas, and their\r\nenterprise marks one of the great turning points in our history. It was\r\nin fact during this century that England raised herself from the last\r\nplace among commercial peoples to one of the first. At the close of the\r\nfourteenth century, as we have seen, English merchandise was mostly\r\nborne in foreign ships; a hundred years later, English vessels carried\r\nmore than a half of all the cloths exported from the country, and about\r\nthree quarters of all other goods,[157] and the Navigation Act that\r\nhad failed under Richard the Second was put in triumphant operation by\r\nHenry the Seventh.[158]\r\n\r\nIt was in the Northern Seas that the real stress of the battle lay.\r\nThere from a very early time bands of roving adventurers went cruising\r\nfrom harbour to harbour to discover what spoils of trade the orthodox\r\nmerchants of the Staple or the Hanse had left ungathered, and how the\r\nfertile resources of the lawless free-trader might be used to shatter\r\nthese stately organizations. When the older merchants concentrated\r\nthemselves in Bruges and Calais the free lances of trade sought out\r\nthe neglected markets of Brabant and Holland. Driven from the marshes\r\nof Middleburg they turned to Antwerp which the Staplers had forsaken.\r\nScarcely had the Hanse merchants under the stress of their Danish wars\r\nwithdrawn from Bergen than the Adventurers forthwith slipped into their\r\nplace, set up their own Staple, gathering goods there to the value of\r\n10,000 marks, and for years fought steadily against fire and sword\r\nto hold their own.[159] If the Baltic towns fell behind the western\r\nmembers of the League in maritime enterprize, the Adventurers’ fleets\r\nflocked to their harbours, so that three hundred of them were seen in\r\nthe harbour of Danzig alone, carrying dealers in cloth ready to spread\r\ntheir wares in every market town of Prussia. They pushed their way\r\ninto the fish-markets of Schonen, offering bales of cloth instead of\r\nmoney[160] for salt herrings, and rousing the alarm of the Hanseatic\r\nmerchants there also. By the close of the fourteenth century they had\r\nso prospered in the world on all sides that they professed to look on\r\nlarge branches of trade as their own exclusive property, and to make\r\na grievance of interference with their profits by other “meddling\r\nmerchants who were not content with their own business in which they\r\nhad been brought up and by which they were well able to live.”\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of a new stage in their history. The Adventurers\r\nnow proposed to enter the decent ranks of recognized associations,\r\nand exchange their roving wars for the more formal aggressions of a\r\nchartered company; and at their prayer Henry the Fourth granted them\r\nin 1406, for their better ordering and for their protection from\r\nother “meddling merchants,” a charter by which they took as their\r\nofficial title their old name of the Merchant Adventurers.[161] The\r\ngrant included all dominions over-sea, and allowed them to wander\r\nwhere they would in the wide world, and to draw within their ranks all\r\nthe Adventurers of England.[162] As yet their organization was loose\r\nand free, and was in fact no true incorporation as a Guild. But it\r\nmarked the passing away of their free and stormy youth. From this time\r\nprivileges came to them from all sides by English grants, by gifts\r\nfrom foreign towns, by protection of the rulers of various countries.\r\nFinally in 1446 they received a new charter of privileges from the\r\nDuke of Burgundy[163] by which their tolls were fixed, full protection\r\nassured to them, and an organization provided which lasted for the\r\nnext century. So confident did they become of their power, that when\r\nHenry the Seventh at his accession raised the tolls required of them\r\nthey refused to pay, and he did not dare to enforce the order.[164]\r\nSeeing indeed in their success the triumph of English commerce, he\r\nremained their steady supporter, confirmed their privileges,[165] and\r\nwhen at Calais they desired greater centralization and a stricter\r\ndiscipline, he gave them a regular organization after the pattern of\r\nthe Staplers under Edward the Third, with governors and a council of\r\ntwenty-four assistants.[166] Amid all their successes it was little\r\nwonder that there came a time when they themselves forgot the free\r\naudacity of their adventurous youth. In their maturer years, as the\r\nvehement assertors of monopoly and State protection, they cast behind\r\ntheir backs the very remembrance of their lawless predecessors, and for\r\na braver pedigree they traced their greatness back to ancestors made\r\nrespectable by a fabled charter from King John himself, and boasted of\r\nAldermen clothed in scarlet who were supposed to have borne rule over\r\nthem in good old times in Antwerp.\r\n\r\nThe legend was the product of a time when Antwerp was in fact\r\nthe capital of the Merchant Adventurers—the home and centre of\r\ntheir trade. For there in the fifteenth century they entered on an\r\ninheritance which had been left waste when the merchant princes of\r\nthe Staple had finally retired to Calais, and had thus practically\r\nabandoned all direct trade between Antwerp and England to private\r\nhands. The Adventurers soon solved the question of who was to carry it\r\non.[167] In 1407 the city gave them a House in perpetual succession.\r\nThree of their merchants sat in the Toll-hall with the toll-keepers\r\nof the borough to see justice done to their brethren. Known among\r\nthe people as “the nation,”[168] they early showed their power, and\r\nin the first half of the fifteenth century privileges in the English\r\ntrade were more and more withdrawn from the native traders of the\r\nNetherlands, and gathered into their own hands. They used their powers\r\nto the full, governed firmly, ordered the whole English trade with the\r\nLow Countries, dictated what fair was to be attended, and ruled the\r\nprices, in spite of the loud remonstrances of the unlucky natives.[169]\r\nAt the great marts held in the Netherlands four times a year[170] “they\r\nstapled the commodities which they brought out of England, and put the\r\nsame to sale,”[171] and by 1436 they could boast that they bought more\r\ngoods in Brabant, Flanders, and Zealand[172] than all other nations,\r\nand that if their merchants were withdrawn it would be as great a loss\r\nto the French trade as though a thousand men of war were sent into the\r\ncountry.[173] The growing jealousy of the manufacturers in Flanders\r\nindeed threatened at times to cut off their entire business; and as\r\nthey were the first to bear the rising storm of commercial rivalries,\r\nso again and again they were brought within sight of ruin by the laws\r\npassed on either side the water forbidding all import or export trade.\r\n\r\nFor in their desperate attempt to save the Flemish weavers from ruin\r\nthe Dukes of Burgundy forbade dressers to finish English cloth, or\r\ntailors to cut it in the Netherlands, and laid heavy penalties on any\r\nman in Flanders who was seen dressed in woollen stuffs of English\r\nmake;[174] but still the cloth came in, smuggled by speculating dealers\r\nfrom Antwerp, or scattered broadcast by licensed merchants who had\r\nbought from the authorities leave to evade the law.[175] Once in\r\nconsequence of political disputes[176] the Adventurers had to migrate\r\nto Calais, and see the legal trade with the Low Countries given to\r\nthe Easterlings, a sight which “sore nipped their hearts;” but first\r\nin “disordered” fashion, then lawfully, they were soon back at their\r\nold occupations.[177] With the steady support of Henry the Seventh,\r\nwhose whole policy was directed to develope the trade with Burgundy\r\nand bind England and the Netherlands into a united commercial state,\r\ntheir prosperity was assured; and before the close of the century\r\nAntwerp, after two hundred years of struggle for supremacy in trade,\r\ntook its place as the great centre of commerce[178] in the Netherlands,\r\nwhile its rival Bruges sank into utter poverty and decay. When at last\r\nafter many chances and changes, the English won in 1506 through Henry\r\nthe Seventh free trade in cloth throughout all the dominions of the\r\nArchduke Philip save Flanders, they actually found themselves better\r\noff in the Netherlands than the native merchants, paid less tolls\r\nthan they, and were in a position whence they might easily overrun\r\nthe country with their wares and finally destroy its decaying cloth\r\nindustry.[179]\r\n\r\nFrom their central stronghold in Antwerp the Merchant Adventurers\r\nfurther maintained a lively war to right and left, on the one side with\r\nthe Staple at Calais, on the other with the Hanseatic League.\r\n\r\nIt was practically the jealousy of the Staplers that had first driven\r\nthe Adventurers from Bruges, and no sooner did they feel their strength\r\nthan they prepared to make their ancient enemies pay the penalty for\r\nold wrongs. Towards the merchants of the Staple the very character\r\nof their trade from the first forced them into a militant attitude.\r\nShut out from all interest in the sale of wool, their fortune rested\r\nsolely on the manufacturing industries, and the more weaving at home\r\nwas encouraged the greater were their gains.[180] And since the\r\nwool merchants proceeded both to claim and to practise the right of\r\nexporting and selling cloth as well as wool, they became in a double\r\nsense obnoxious to their rivals. Now, however, the Adventurers could\r\nfight from the vantage ground given them by their new position as a\r\nchartered company. Out of their acknowledged right to demand tolls\r\non the sale of cloth in their marts, they deduced by a liberal\r\ninterpretation of their powers the right to require from each trading\r\nStapler in addition to the ordinary tolls an entrance fee or hanse of\r\nten marks, by payment of which he became a freeman of the Adventurers’\r\nCompany and was made subject to their laws and courts,[181] and if\r\nhe refused to pay they seized his wares, or imprisoned him till\r\nhe gave the “hanse.”[182] Wealthy merchants of the Staple who had\r\ntaken their wares to Middleburg might find themselves thrown into\r\nprison among felons and murderers infected with odious diseases; the\r\nresolute Adventurers refused bail, and quietly ignored royal letters\r\nof remonstrance.[183] Already in 1457 the Staplers complained bitterly\r\nto the English King and to the Duke of Burgundy, that under colour\r\nof letters patent and charters, their enemies so vexed them both in\r\ntheir goods and persons as to threaten them with utter ruin.[184] But\r\nthe decision of Henry the Sixth that the Adventurers were asserting\r\nunjust claims which were strictly forbidden for the future[185]\r\nscarcely interrupted the battle, and the same series of complaints\r\nand aggressions was brought in 1504 before the Star Chamber, by whose\r\njudgement the Adventurers were again forbidden to go beyond their\r\nright of levying tolls. But if the law was against them they had\r\non their side their own inexhaustible activity, their unscrupulous\r\naudacity, their large self-confidence, and the weakness of the dying\r\ncompany of the Staple. Six years later when the Staplers again summoned\r\nthem before the King for their “crooked minds and froward sayings”\r\nand lawless deeds of violence, they answered with uncompromising\r\ncontempt. The Staplers, they allowed, might have certain privileges\r\nin Calais—but as to talking of rights in Burgundy, that in their\r\nopinion was absurd to urge after the removal of the Staple thence.\r\nOutside Calais the Staplers had no rights. With regard to their claim\r\nto exclusive jurisdiction over their members, “that article might have\r\nbeen left out of their book, for why every reasonable man knoweth\r\nthe contrary.” In spite of such “reasonable men,” however, once more\r\nthe law was proclaimed to be against them; but as they knew well the\r\nlaw was powerless to set up again the ruined company of the Merchant\r\nStaplers.[186]\r\n\r\nWith the second and more formidable army arrayed against them, the\r\nmerchants of the Hanseatic League, the war of the Adventurers had to be\r\ncarried on with greater circumspection. Through a couple of centuries\r\nthe doubtful conflict was maintained on every sea and in every port\r\nfrom Danzig to Iceland. For the first hundred years things went ill\r\nfor the Adventurers. The League monopolized the whole commerce between\r\nthe Scandinavian kingdoms and England;[187] drove out the English\r\nfrom Schonen, the centre to which all the fishers of the Baltic and\r\nNorth Seas gathered for the salting, packing, and selling of their\r\nfish;[188] harassed them with fire and sword in Bergen, the Staple\r\ntown of the north,[189] scattering them at one time by starvation, at\r\nanother by decrees of expulsion; banished them from the Prussian towns\r\nbelonging to the Teutonic Order which they were “destroying” with their\r\ncloth,[190] and sought to ruin their trade by issuing an order that no\r\nmerchant of the Hanse should buy English cloth outside England itself.\r\nWhen the League waged war with Denmark and Norway in 1368-9 to confirm\r\nits mastery of the Northern Seas, it dragged the English traders at\r\nits heels into the fight, and at its close threw them off without a\r\nthought.[191] It gave a scornful answer to demands made by Parliament\r\nunder Edward the Third and Richard the Second that the tolls exacted\r\nfrom Hanseatic traders for exporting goods from England should be\r\nincreased; and retorted by a decree that all trade with England should\r\nbe utterly broken off, thus shutting the great market at Elbing to the\r\nEnglish merchants who had made it the centre of their trade with Russia\r\nand the towns of Prussia.[192]\r\n\r\nThe English traders, however, took all misfortune with the hardihood\r\nand exuberant courage of youth. Help from their own government was\r\nbeyond hoping for, so long as conquering kings like Edward the Third\r\nand Henry the Fifth were bound hand and foot to the great mercantile\r\nhouses of Lübeck and the Hanse towns by the loans raised from them\r\nto carry on the French wars; while Henry the Fourth, who, before\r\nhe came to the throne, had been in Danzig and seen the troubles of\r\nthe English merchants there,[193] and who in his anxiety to win the\r\nsupport of the trading class, was persistent in negotiations to improve\r\ntheir position, had not the power to give effect to his desires. The\r\nAdventurers, therefore, could only follow the one obvious course open\r\nto them, and kept up a steady brigandage on the seas and a series of\r\nopportune attacks on the enemy’s out-posts. They held on desperately\r\nat Bergen,[194] and stoutly clung to the formal right which Henry the\r\nFourth had given them to organize themselves under consuls in Norway,\r\nSweden, or Denmark, for the carrying on of their trade.[195] Fishing\r\nboats which were shut out from the Baltic or from Bergen sailed on to\r\nIceland, where, as the island was the private property of the King of\r\nNorway (who was himself the servant of the League) and was allowed\r\nto receive no ships save the King’s, or those licensed by the King,\r\nopportunities for illegal trade were abundant and profits large. A\r\nfrugal people, needy and remote, eagerly welcomed smuggled goods from\r\nEngland in exchange for their fish; and the smugglers carried on a\r\nrough business—outlaws and daring men of their company plundered and\r\nkilled and stole cattle and desolated homesteads, and bartered after\r\ntheir own self-made laws.[196] It mattered nothing to them that Henry\r\nthe Fifth, in obedience to the League, forbade the trade, or that in\r\na storm of 1419 twenty-five English ships were driven on the coast\r\nof Iceland in three hours. Bristol men found their way to its shores\r\nby help of the compass, leaving for us the first record of its use in\r\nEngland, probably in 1424; and about 1436, in a year when the English\r\nhad been expelled from Bergen, so many vessels sailed to Iceland that\r\nthey could get no return cargo, and half of them had to come empty\r\nhome.[197] But the northern trade was not all violent or lawless.\r\nEnglish merchants bought double licenses from the English and the\r\nNorwegian kings, which allowed them to carry on a regular traffic; and\r\nin the middle of the fifteenth century one of the Bristol merchants,\r\nCannynges, had in his hands the chief trade with northern Europe.\r\nNot only were his factors established in the Baltic ports, but his\r\ntransactions with Iceland and with Finland were on so great a scale\r\nthat when in 1450 all English trade with these regions was forbidden in\r\nvirtue of a treaty with the King of Denmark, Cannynges was specially\r\nexempted on account of the debts due to him there by Danish subjects,\r\nand for two years he had a monopoly of the trade.[198]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Adventurers watched their opportunity to carry the\r\nwar nearer home, for the League, already weighted with the effort to\r\nmaintain its monopoly before the rise of Scandinavian powers and the\r\nconsolidation of the Duchy of Burgundy, was further troubled within its\r\nown ranks by divided counsels.[199] In the reign of Henry the Sixth,\r\ntherefore, the English renewed among other claims their old demand that\r\nthe Hanseatic merchants should no longer be favoured at their expense,\r\nbut should be treated like any other foreigners and forced to pay the\r\nsame tolls on wine and wool. There was a chance of success, for Lübeck\r\nand the western towns finding in their strength and self-reliance\r\narguments for a policy of peace with England, were generally for\r\namicable compromise; though the eastern towns led by Danzig, weaker\r\nat sea and peculiarly sensitive to any increase of money burdens,\r\npreferred fighting to submission with its apprehended dangers.[200] The\r\nparty of violence won the day and a fierce maritime war followed with\r\nopen hostilities and reprisals and lawsuits and endless negociations.\r\nOn one occasion the English seized a fleet of 108 sail returning to\r\nLübeck and Riga, and the men of the Hanse retaliated by laying hands on\r\nrich English prizes. Trade was so ruined that Henry the Sixth declared\r\nhimself unable to pay to the Count Palatine the dowry of his aunt Lady\r\nBlanche, because there were now no dues and customs coming into his\r\nTreasury from the German merchants.[201] At last the dispute came to\r\na climax in 1469, when the English quarrelled with the German traders\r\nin London, summoned them before the courts and imposed a fine of\r\n£13,520,[202] while members of the Steel Yard were thrown into prison,\r\nand the corporation nearly broken up.[203] The answer of Bremen,\r\nHamburg, and Danzig was given in a fleet which gathered against England\r\nunder the leadership of Charles the Bold. But just at this moment came\r\nthe English revolution by which Edward the Fourth was driven out of the\r\ncountry, and all the great trading bodies, the Hanseatic League, and\r\nthe Flemish and Dutch corporations, seeing the danger which threatened\r\ntheir commerce from the new political situation, cast aside minor\r\nquarrels and united to set Edward again on the throne.[204] Such a\r\nservice demanded a great reward; and in 1474 a treaty was signed at\r\nUtrecht, by which the Hanse was given back all its earlier privileges,\r\nand secured in possession of its Guild Hall and Steel Yard in London,\r\nand its houses in Boston and Lynn. The Adventurers who made a bold\r\ndemand that the Easterlings should renounce the right of carrying out\r\nwool or wool-fells from England can scarcely have expected to succeed;\r\nbut they at least gained some measure of peace for their colony in\r\nDanzig.[205]\r\n\r\nThe Hanseatic League, however, had now come to an end of its triumphs.\r\nFrom this time the English pressed them hard. A law which forbade\r\nthe import of silk and the export of undressed cloths struck a heavy\r\nblow at their trade. Then came the order that Rhine wine must only\r\nbe carried in English ships. Officials used their infinite powers of\r\nannoyance with hearty good will, and the merchant who landed with his\r\ngoods, harassed first by the relentless officers sitting at the receipt\r\nof custom, and then thwarted in every possible way by the Mayor and\r\ncorporation,[206] was at last driven by public abuse behind the walls\r\nof the Steel Yard, so that in 1490 a member of the Hanse dared scarcely\r\nshow himself in the streets of London.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the great confederation of Commonwealths itself showed grave\r\nsigns of falling asunder. The bigger towns that no longer needed the\r\nprotection of the association were quite ready to forsake it, and in\r\n1501 began to refuse to bring their cloth to the Staple at Bruges, and\r\nto look for freer conditions of trade. At the same time the monopoly\r\nof the League was being threatened on all sides. The Prussian and\r\nLivonian towns treated them as enemies. A Dutch fleet competed with\r\nthem in the Baltic. A Danish trading company had risen to dispute their\r\nmonopoly in Denmark. The Swedes shut them out. The Norwegians made\r\nintermittent experiments at independence. At last in 1478 came the\r\nworst calamity that could befall their trade, the capture of Novgorod\r\nby the Muscovites, with the destruction of its free government and the\r\nruin of its position as one of the commercial capitals of the world.\r\n\r\nWith the demolition of the League factory, the loss of all its\r\npossessions in the city, and the whole dislocation of the Eastern\r\ntraffic, the supremacy of the Hanseatic Confederation was shattered,\r\nas the supremacy of the Italians in the Southern trade had been\r\nshattered half a century before by the conquest of Alexandria. English\r\nAdventurers naturally saw in every fresh trouble that assailed their\r\nrivals a new argument for aggression, and welcomed in Henry the Seventh\r\na leader equal to the great occasion. Never had they found a better\r\nfriend, or one who so finely interpreted the popular instinct of his\r\ntime. How completely his determination to strengthen by every means\r\nin his power the position of the Adventurers in Antwerp against the\r\nHanseatic traders at Bruges, and to bind England and Burgundy together\r\ninto a united commercial state, fell in with the needs and temper of\r\nhis people was strikingly shown after a two years’ interruption of\r\ncommerce with the Low Countries caused by the affair of Perkin Warbeck,\r\nwhen a burst of popular joy hailed the renewal of trade, and the wild\r\nenthusiasm of the people gave to the treaty of 1496 which restored the\r\nold kindly relations the high-sounding name of the _Intercursus Magnus_.\r\n\r\nThe big name has, as usual, imposed a little on later generations, and\r\ngreater treaties have gone unnoticed for want of an equally pompous\r\ntitle. At first, indeed, amid the political disquiet and the trade\r\ndepression which marked the early years of his reign, Henry went to\r\nwork slowly and patiently, and in 1486 even confirmed the Utrecht\r\ntreaty of 1474 which ensured a number of privileges to the Hanse. But\r\nthis policy of peace was only assumed for a brief space while he was\r\nmaking ready for war. In 1486 he renewed the commercial treaty made by\r\nEdward with Britanny in 1467.[207] The real campaign, however, may be\r\nsaid to have opened by the Navigation Act of 1489, when the shipping\r\ntrade was definitely taken under State protection. And what that State\r\nprotection implied was at once shown in a series of commercial treaties\r\nwith almost every trading country of Europe, whether its traffic lay in\r\nthe northern or the southern seas. Building up on every hand alliances\r\nagainst the Hanseatic Confederation he steadily drew to himself the\r\nfriendship of the Scandinavian peoples tired of the domination of the\r\nLeague. In 1489 he sent an embassy (two of the deputation being Lynn\r\nmerchants), to make terms for a commercial alliance with Denmark and\r\nNorway, and won from the Northern powers freedom of trade for the\r\nEnglish in Denmark, Norway, and Iceland, with the right to acquire\r\nland, to form corporations and choose aldermen, and to be under special\r\nprotection of the Danish King.[208] To defeat the pretensions of Danzig\r\nhe turned to the Livonian towns, and by treaty with Riga attempted to\r\nsecure a Russian trade which might open the way of Novgorod and the\r\nEast to English Adventurers—an attempt which however was frustrated\r\na few years later.[209] A conference was held in 1491 at Antwerp with\r\nthe Hanseatic envoys, whom Henry with diplomatic insolence kept idly\r\nwaiting for four weeks till the messengers he had sent to Denmark with\r\nfriendly proposals of a treaty as unfavourable as possible to the\r\ninterests of the Hanse, returned with their answer. The promise of this\r\ninauspicious opening for the League was amply fulfilled in the long\r\nnegotiations which lasted at Antwerp from 1491 to 1499, and in which\r\nthe foreigner was consistently humbled before the triumphant Merchant\r\nAdventurer, all his compromises rejected so far as they tended to limit\r\nthe freedom of the English trader, and the League compelled to accept\r\nterms ruinous to its interests and disastrous to its great tradition of\r\nsupremacy.[210]\r\n\r\nThe story of these Antwerp negotiations gives us a true measure of the\r\nplace gained during the last hundred years by the Merchant Adventurers\r\nin the North, where, having dealt the last blows to the ancient company\r\nof the Staple, and broken the power of the Hanseatic League, their\r\nfleets now sailed triumphantly on every sea. And yet this was but half\r\ntheir work; for the North was a small thing to win unless they could\r\nalso load English vessels with the cargoes of the East and the tribute\r\nof the great commercial cities of the Mediterranean. Until the middle\r\nof the fifteenth century the trade of the eastern Mediterranean had\r\nbeen altogether carried on by Italians.[211] It was only in 1432 that\r\nthe French merchant Jacques Coeur (the stories of whose wealth and\r\npower read like fables beside the modest doings of our native traders),\r\nhad sent out some ships to take part in the Eastern trade; and the\r\nLevant was not really opened to Western merchants till 1442, when the\r\nVenetians were driven out of Egypt and the monopoly of the Italians\r\nbroken up. It was very soon after that a Bristol merchant, Sturmys,\r\nfitted out probably the first English ship that visited the Eastern\r\nshores of the Mediterranean. But the new inheritors of the East were\r\nreceived with bitter jealousies. Rival vessels fought for the spoils\r\nand carried off the booty like common pirates; and the Genoese traders\r\nin their anger seized Sturmys’ ship on its return voyage and robbed\r\nit of its cargo of spices and green pepper. He reckoned his loss at\r\n6,000 francs, and on his complaint to the government all the Genoese\r\nmerchants in London were thrown into prison until they should give\r\nbonds for the payment of this sum.[212]\r\n\r\nThe question of the Mediterranean was thus vigorously opened. In\r\nLondon, indeed, the Italians might securely reckon on hard treatment.\r\nMerchants just beginning to feel their strength, half-ruined Staplers,\r\nLondon shopkeepers and manufacturers, all alike hated their Italian\r\nrivals with a common hatred, and were crying out for the most decisive\r\nmeasures against foreign competition. Less careful than their King\r\nof nursing political alliances[213] in view of foreign wars and\r\ncomplications, the traders boldly proposed a bill in the Parliament\r\nof 1439 to forbid the Venetians from carrying any wares save those of\r\ntheir own manufacture—a measure which if it had passed would have\r\npractically annihilated the whole Venetian trade to England. Their\r\nnext proposal was a law to forbid selling anything to the Genoese or\r\ncarrying anything to their port. Steadily supported as the Lombards\r\nwere by the King against the people, they nevertheless saw their\r\nprivileges from this time limited step by step; and once after the\r\npersecution of 1455 in London even attempted to leave the capital for\r\never. The great days of their trade monopoly were gone. Edward the\r\nFourth and Richard the Third laid heavy burdens on them. Henry the\r\nSeventh kept them dependent on his arbitrary will for a very slight\r\nincrease of freedom, such as he might see fit to grant from time to\r\ntime, tried to limit their gains, and in the very first year of his\r\nreign forbade them to carry French woad or wine, or silk goods, and\r\nfurther hindered them in the export of wool.\r\n\r\nAt this time the population of the Venetian Republic was bigger\r\nthan that of all England, and English traders had a good many other\r\naffairs on their hands beside their quarrel with Venice. The dispute,\r\nnevertheless, did not languish. No sooner were Henry’s regulations\r\nproclaimed in 1485 than English merchants set sail for Crete, bought\r\nup the stores of malmsey there,[214] and carried them off to the\r\nNetherlands under the very eyes of the Venetian captains. Venice passed\r\na law against such traffic, and in the stress of anxiety as to the\r\nEnglish competition took to building better ships to maintain her own\r\ncarrying trade; while England retorted by setting up a monopoly of her\r\nown wool in revenge for the Venetian monopoly of wine.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the quick-witted Florentines, driven out of traditional\r\nroutine by the intensity of the long competition for supremacy, had\r\nbegun to doubt the value for them of the old policy of naval protection\r\nwhich the city had shared with Venice and Genoa; and had frankly\r\nadopted in 1480 a system of free-trade. In Constantinople and Egypt\r\nFlorence began again to hold her own against Venice and to win back\r\ncommand of Eastern markets, and she eagerly welcomed English wool\r\nmerchants to her port at Pisa.[215] In 1485, the year when England\r\nentered into the lists with Venice, these had become so numerous and\r\npowerful a body that a consul was appointed over them; and five years\r\nlater, Henry made a commercial treaty with Florence which was one\r\nof the most remarkable acts of his reign. By its provisions English\r\nmerchants undertook to carry every year to Florence sufficient wool\r\nto supply all the Italian States save Venice, and in return they were\r\ngiven every privilege their hearts desired.[216] The only resource left\r\nto the Venetians was to forbid that any wine should be shipped from\r\nCrete to Pisa, so that English vessels which went out laden with wool\r\nfinding no return cargo should be driven to sail home empty. Henry\r\nimmediately set such heavy import duties on malmsey in England that the\r\nVenetians, seeing their wine-trade on the point of ruin, bowed at last\r\nto the inevitable. The victory of the English merchants was finally\r\nproclaimed when Henry in 1507 only consented to renew the charter that\r\ngave Venetians rights of trade in England on condition that they bound\r\nthemselves to do no carrying trade between the Netherlands and England,\r\nbut to leave that to the Merchant Adventurers.[217]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in all the ports visited by English ships between the\r\nMediterranean and the Channel the same buoyant spirit of successful\r\nenterprise vanquished every obstacle. Englishmen had always traded much\r\nwith their fellow-subjects in Aquitaine. From the days of St. Thomas\r\nCanterbury had dealings with the wine-growers of the south.[218] Ships\r\nof Bordeaux were known in every port of the Channel, and in 1350, 141\r\nvessels laden with wine sailed thence to London alone,[219] while the\r\nearly wealth of Bristol had been created by the cargoes of wool carried\r\nfrom its port to feed the Gascon manufactories, and the casks of wine\r\nsent back to fill its cellars. Conditions so pleasant for the Bristol\r\nburghers were rudely changed when in 1445 Bordeaux fell into the hands\r\nof the French, and English traders instead of being the masters had\r\nto go humbly at the bidding of the men of Bordeaux with a red cross\r\non their backs, doing business only in the town, or going into the\r\ncountry under the guardianship of a police agent. But if the burghers\r\nof the later fifteenth century cared nothing for the re-conquest of\r\nthe French provinces, on the other hand they were determined not to\r\nlose their trade. The wool dealers, shut out of Bordeaux, turned to\r\nthe North, to Rouen and Calais, changed their wool there for the wine\r\nof Niederburgund, and so started the woollen manufactures of Normandy,\r\nwhile those of Bordeaux declined. By a succession of commercial\r\ntreaties[220] and by the Navigation Act of 1489, which shut out Gascon\r\nships from the English wine trade, Henry secured for English merchants\r\nin Bordeaux such adequate protection that the efforts of Louis the\r\nTwelfth to limit their freedom of trade by passing a Navigation Act of\r\nhis own were utterly vain. The Bordeaux citizens, filled with impotent\r\nrage, watched the English traders going up and down the land, 6,000\r\nto 8,000 of them, as they averred, armed with sticks, and scouring the\r\ncountry for wine.\r\n\r\nThe ports of Spain and Portugal also were visited by increasing\r\nnumbers of English vessels on their way to the Mediterranean, and old\r\ntrading alliances were renewed with countries whose harbours were such\r\nvaluable resting places.[221] There had long been commercial treaties\r\nwith Castile and Catalonia, who competed for the profits to be won by\r\ncarrying to England Spanish iron and fruits along with the wine and\r\nwoad of neighbouring lands. But Henry the Seventh took the occasion of\r\nthe negotiations for the Spanish marriage in 1489 to stipulate anew for\r\nfreedom of trade and protection of English ships; while at the same\r\ntime the English merchants asserted that by the new Navigation Act the\r\nwhole export trade was now their exclusive right, and under the plea\r\nthat their ships could not make the voyage to Spain unless they had a\r\ncertainty of coming back well laden, forbade the carrying of Toulouse\r\nwoad and Gascony wine in Spanish ships. By this time the Englishman had\r\nas usual roused the fear and hatred of the native merchants, and the\r\nSpaniards violently resisted the new policy. Heavy tolls were imposed\r\non either side to ruin the trade of the other, and in one season eight\r\nhundred English ships were sent home empty from Seville because the\r\npatriotic Spanish dealers with one accord refused their wares to the\r\nenemy. Again fortune came to help the pertinacity of the Adventurers.\r\nIn 1492 Spain drove the Jews and Moors from her shores. But their\r\nbusiness simply fell into alien hands waiting to receive it, and the\r\nhated English merchants flocked to Spanish harbours now swept of their\r\nold rivals, and sailed back to England laden with the gold of the New\r\nWorld.[222]\r\n\r\nNor was the good chance that favoured them in Portugal less wonderful.\r\nWith the traders of Lisbon and Oporto England had entered into a\r\ncommercial treaty in the middle of the fourteenth century—a treaty\r\nwhich was altered in 1386 to include the whole of Portugal.[223] But by\r\nsome happy destiny whose favours strewed the path of English traders,\r\nthey asked and obtained in 1458 a revision of old agreements so as\r\nto secure the utmost advantage for their own interests, and all this\r\nhad been completed just before the discovery of the Cape route gave\r\nto Portugal its enormous naval importance and threw Eastern commerce\r\ninto a new channel. The quarrel with Venice inspired the English with\r\nincreased ardour in their friendship for the new masters of the spice\r\ntrade; and when Portuguese dealers invited English merchants to make\r\ntheir bargains for Eastern wares in Lisbon instead of journeying to\r\nVenice, these gathered in such numbers to the new emporium of Indian\r\ngoods that their own shipping failed to carry the wealth offered to\r\nthem and the merchants had to hire Portuguese vessels.[224]\r\n\r\nThus it was that in the face of the powerful confederations that held\r\nthe trade of the Northern and the Southern Seas English merchants were\r\nlaying violent hands on the commerce of the world. They had vanquished\r\ntheir rivals in the north, while in the south they had firmly planted\r\nthemselves in every important trading port along the western coast of\r\nEurope, and competed with the Italian Republics not only for their\r\nown carrying trade but for that of the Netherlands as well. If in the\r\nreign of Edward the Third practically the whole of the foreign commerce\r\nof England was carried in foreign vessels, in the reign of Henry the\r\nSeventh the great bulk of the trade had passed into English hands.\r\nBritish merchants were to be found in every port from Alexandria to\r\nReykjavik, and wherever they touched left behind them an organized and\r\nfirmly established trade. As we have seen, their battle for supremacy\r\nin commerce had in its beginnings been fought by free-traders and\r\npirates warring against the orderly forces of organized protection; but\r\nthe final victory was awarded to them in their later stage of a company\r\nof monopolists sustained and cherished by the State. The question,\r\nindeed, of how far protection contributed to the success of the English\r\nor to the loss of the foreigner is far from being a simple one. For\r\nin its first stages the work done by protection may possibly consist\r\nfor a time mainly in the _abolition_ of privilege, and this process may\r\npass by very slow and imperceptible degrees to its last stage, that of\r\n_conferring_ privilege. It is, therefore, hard to decipher the lesson\r\nwhen we are studying a commerce where protection has but begun its\r\nwork in conflict with a commerce when that work is perfected. In the\r\nhistory of the later fifteenth century, moreover, the problem is yet\r\nfurther complicated by the present working of those vast forces which\r\nmake or unmake the fortunes of continents, and before which the wisest\r\npolicies of States, policies of protection or of free-trade or of any\r\nother elaborate product of human intelligence, are powerful as an army\r\nof phantoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON LIFE OF THE TOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nWE who have been trained under the modern system have forgotten how\r\npeople lived in the old days, when the necessity of personal effort was\r\nforced home to every single member of the fellowship of freemen who had\r\nlife or liberties or property to protect. For in spite of the vigour\r\nand independence of our modern local administration every Englishman\r\nnow looks ultimately for the laws that rule his actions, and the force\r\nthat protects his property, to the great central authority which has\r\ngrown up outside and beyond all local authorities. He is subject to\r\nit in all the circumstances of life; whether it exercises wholly new\r\nfunctions unknown to the middle ages; or takes over to itself powers\r\nwhich once belonged to inferior bodies, and makes them serve national\r\ninstead of local ends; whether it asserts a new direction and control\r\nover municipal administration; or whether, instead of replacing the\r\ntown authorities by its own rule, it upholds them with the support of\r\nits vast resources and boundless strength. By whatever right the State\r\nholds its manifold powers, whether by inheritance, or purchase, or\r\nsubstitution, or influence, or the superiority of mere might, he feels\r\nits working on every hand. It is to him visibly charged with all the\r\ngrand operations of government.\r\n\r\nBut to a burgher of the middle ages the care and protection of\r\nthe State were dim and shadowy compared with the duties and\r\nresponsibilities thrown on the townspeople themselves. For in the\r\nbeginnings of municipal life the affairs of the borough great and\r\nsmall, its prosperity, its safety, its freedom from crime, the gaiety\r\nand variety of its life, the regulation of its trade, were the business\r\nof the citizens alone. Fenced in by its wall and ditch[225]—fenced in\r\nyet more effectually by the sense of danger without, and the clinging\r\nto privileges won by common effort that separated it from the rest of\r\nthe world—the town remained isolated and self-dependent. Within these\r\nnarrow borders the men who went out to win the carrying trade of the\r\nworld learned their first lessons in organization, and acquired the\r\ntemper by virtue of which Englishmen were to build up at home a great\r\npolitical society and to conquer abroad the supremacy of the seas—the\r\ntemper which we recognize in an early confession of faith put forth\r\nby the citizens of Hereford as to the duties which a man owed to his\r\ncommonwealth and to its chief magistrate. “And he to be our head next\r\nunder the King, whom we ought in all things touching our King or the\r\nstate of our city to obey chiefly in three things—first, when we are\r\nsent for by day or by night to consult of those things which appertain\r\nto the King or the state of the city; secondly, to answer if we offend\r\nin any point contrary to our oath, or our fellow-citizens; thirdly,\r\nto perform the affairs of the city _at our own charges, if so be they\r\nmay be finished either sooner or better than by any other of our\r\ncitizens_.”[226] Public claims were insistent, and under the primitive\r\nconditions of communal life, in small societies where every man lived\r\nin the direct light of public opinion, no citizen was allowed to count\r\ncarefully the cost of sacrifice, or stint the measure of his service,\r\nwhen the welfare of his little community was at stake. His duties were\r\nplainly laid down before him, and they were rigidly exacted. According\r\nto the accepted theory it was understood that all private will and\r\nadvantage were to be sacrificed to the common good, and Langland speaks\r\nbitterly of the “individualists” of his day.\r\n\r\n  “For they will and would as best were for themselves,\r\n  Though the King and the commons all the cost had.\r\n  All reason reproveth such imperfect people.”[227]\r\n\r\nI. The inhabitants of a mediæval borough were subject to a discipline\r\nas severe as that of a military state of modern times. Threatened\r\nby enemies on every side, constantly surrounded by perils, they had\r\nthemselves to bear the whole charges of fortification and defence. If\r\na French fleet appeared on the coast, if Welsh or Scotch armies made a\r\nraid across the frontier, if civil war broke out and opposing forces\r\nmarched across the country, every town had to look to its own safety.\r\nThe inhabitants served under a system of universal conscription.\r\nAt the muster-at-arms held twice a year poor and rich appeared in\r\nmilitary array with such weapons as they could bring forth for the\r\nKing’s service; the poor marching with knife or dagger or hatchet; the\r\nprosperous burghers, bound according to mediæval ideas to live “after\r\ntheir degree,” displaying mail or wadded coats, bucklers, bows and\r\narrows, swords, or even a gun. At any moment this armed population\r\nmight be called out to active service. “Concerning our bell,” say the\r\ncitizens of Hereford, “we use to have it in a public place where our\r\nchief bailiff may come, as well by day as by night, to give warning to\r\nall men living within the said city and suburbs. And we do not say that\r\nit ought to ring unless it be for some terrible fire burning any row\r\nof houses within the said city, or for any common contention whereby\r\nthe city might be terribly moved, or for any enemies drawing near unto\r\nthe city, or if the city shall be besieged, or any sedition shall be\r\nbetween any, and notice thereof given by any unto our chief bailiff.\r\nAnd in these cases aforesaid, and in all like cases, all manner of\r\nmen abiding within the city and suburbs and liberties of the city,\r\nof what degree soever they be of, ought to come at any such ringing,\r\nor motion of ringing, with such weapons as fit their degree.”[228] At\r\nthe first warning of an enemy’s approach the mayor or bailiff became\r\nsupreme military commander.[229] It was his office to see that the\r\npanic-stricken people of the suburbs were gathered within the walls and\r\ngiven house and food, that all meat and drink and chattels were made\r\nover for the public service, and all armour likewise carried to the\r\nTown Hall, that every inhabitant or refugee paid the taxes required for\r\nthe cost of his protection, that all strong and able men “which doth\r\ndwell in the city or would be assisted by the city in anything” watched\r\nby day and night, and that women and clerics who could not watch\r\nthemselves found at their own charge substitutes “of the ablest of the\r\ncity.”[230]\r\n\r\nIf frontier towns had periods of comparative quiet, the seaports,\r\nthreatened by sea as by land, lived in perpetual alarm, at least\r\nso long as the Hundred Years’ War protracted its terrors. When the\r\ninhabitants had built ships to guard the harbour, and provided money\r\nfor their victualling and the salaries of the crew, they were called\r\nout to repair towers and carry cartloads of rocks or stones to be\r\nlaid on the walls “for defending the town in resisting the king’s\r\nenemies.”[231] Guns had to be carried to the church or the Common House\r\non sleds or laid in pits at the town gates, and gun-stones, saltpetre,\r\nand pellet powder bought. For weeks together watchmen were posted in\r\nthe church towers with horns to give warning if a foe appeared; and\r\npiles of straw, reeds and wood were heaped up on the sea-coast to\r\nkindle beacons and watch-fires. Even if the townsfolk gathered for a\r\nday’s amusement to hear a play in the Court-house a watch was set lest\r\nthe enemy should set fire to their streets—a calamity but too well\r\nknown to the burghers of Rye and Southampton.[232]\r\n\r\nInland towns were in little better case. Civil war, local rebellion,\r\nattacks from some neighbouring lord, outbreaks among the followers\r\nof a great noble lodged within their walls at the head of an army of\r\nretainers, all the recurring incidents of siege and pitched battle\r\nrudely reminded inoffensive shopkeepers and artizans of their military\r\ncalling. Owing to causes but little studied, local conflicts were\r\nfrequent, and they were fought out with violence and determination.\r\nAt the close of the fourteenth century a certain knight, Baldwin of\r\nRadington, with the help of John of Stanley, raised eight hundred\r\nfighting men “to destroy and hurt the commons of Chester”; and these\r\nstalwart warriors broke into the abbey, seized the wine and dashed\r\nthe furniture in pieces, and when the mayor and sheriff came to the\r\nrescue nearly killed the sheriff.[233] When in 1441 the Archbishop of\r\nYork determined to fight for his privileges in Ripon Fair he engaged\r\ntwo hundred men-at-arms from Scotland and the Marches at sixpence or\r\na shilling a day, while a Yorkshire gentleman, Sir John Plumpton,\r\ngathered seven hundred men; and at the battle that ensued, more than a\r\nthousand arrows were discharged by them.[234]\r\n\r\nWithin the town territory the burghers had to serve at their own\r\ncost and charges; but when the King called out their forces to join\r\nhis army the municipal officers had to get the contingent ready, to\r\nprovide their dress or badges, to appoint the captain, and to gather\r\nin money from the various parishes for the soldiers’ pay, “or else\r\nthe constables to be set in prison to abide to such time as it be\r\ncontent and paid.”[235] When they were sent to a distance their fellow\r\ntownsmen bought provisions of salt fish and paniers or bread boxes for\r\nthe carriage of their food,[236] and reluctantly provided a scanty\r\nwage, which was yet more reluctantly doled out to the soldier by his\r\nofficer, and perhaps never reached his pocket at all.[237] Universal\r\nconscription proved then as now the great inculcator of peace. To the\r\nburgher called from the loom and the dyeing pit and the market stall\r\nto take down his bow or dagger, war was a hard and ungrateful service\r\nwhere reward and plunder were dealt out with a niggardly hand; and\r\nmen conceived a deep hatred of strife and disorder of which they had\r\nmeasured all the misery.[238] When the common people dreamed of a\r\nbrighter future, their simple hope was that every maker of deadly\r\nweapons should die by his own tools; for in that better time\r\n\r\n  “Battles shall never eft (again) be, ne man bear edge-tool,\r\n  And if any man [smithy] it, be smit therewith to death.”[239]\r\n\r\nII. Nor even in times of peace might the burghers lay aside their\r\narms, for trouble was never far from their streets. Every inhabitant\r\nwas bound to have his dagger or knife or Irish “skene,” in case he\r\nwas called out to the king’s muster or to aid in keeping the king’s\r\npeace. But daggers which were effective in keeping the peace were\r\nequally effective in breaking it, and the town records are full of\r\ntales of brawls and riots, of frays begun by “railing with words out\r\nof reason,” or by “plucking a man down by the hair of his head,”\r\nbut which always ended in the appearance of a short dagger, “and so\r\ndrew blood upon each other.”[240] For the safety of the community—a\r\nsafety which was the recognized charge of every member of these simple\r\ndemocratic states—each householder was bound to take his turn in\r\nkeeping nightly watch and ward in the streets. It is true indeed that\r\nreluctant citizens constantly by one excuse or another sought to\r\nescape a painful and thankless duty: whether it was whole groups of\r\ninhabitants sheltering themselves behind legal pretexts; or sturdy\r\nrebels breathing out frank defiance of the town authorities. Thus in\r\nAylesbury, according to the constable’s report, one “Reygg kept a\r\nhouse all the year till the watch time came. And when he was summoned\r\nto the watch then came Edward Chalkyll ‘fasesying’ and said he should\r\nnot watch for no man and thus bare him up, and that caused the other\r\nbe the bolder for to bar the King’s watch.... He saith and threateneth\r\nus with his master,” add the constables, “and thus we be over ‘crakyd’\r\nthat we dare not go, for when they be ‘may ten’ they be the bolder.”\r\nJohn Bossey “said the same wise that he would not watch for us”; and\r\nthree others “lacked each of them a night.”[241] But in such cases\r\nthe mayor’s authority was firmly upheld by the whole community, every\r\nburgher knowing well that if any inhabitant shirked his duty a double\r\nburden fell upon the shoulder of his neighbour.\r\n\r\nIII. All inhabitants of a borough were also deeply interested in\r\nthe preservation of the boundaries which marked the extent of their\r\ndominions, the “liberties” within which they could enforce their own\r\nlaw, regulate trade, and raise taxes. Century after century the defence\r\nof the frontier remained one of the urgent questions of town politics,\r\ninsistent, perpetually recurring, now with craft and treachery, now\r\nwith violence and heated passion breaking into sudden flame. Every\r\nyear the mayor and corporation made a perambulation of the bounds and\r\ninspected the landmarks;[242] the common treasure was readily poured\r\nout if lawsuits and bribes were needed to ascertain and preserve the\r\ntown’s rights; and if law failed, the burghers fell back without\r\nhesitation on personal force. In Canterbury the town and the convent\r\nof Christ Church were at open war about this question as about many\r\nothers. The monks remained unconvinced even though the mayor and\r\ncouncil of thirty-six periodically “walked the bounds,” giving copper\r\ncoins at the various turning points to “divers children” that they\r\nmight remember the limits of the franchise, while they themselves\r\nwere refreshed after their trouble by a “potation” in a field near\r\nFordwich. At one time the quarrel as to the frontier raged round a\r\ngigantic ash-tree—the old land-mark where the liberties of the city\r\ntouched those of Fordwich—which was in 1499 treacherously cut down\r\nby the partizans of Christ Church; the Canterbury men with the usual\r\nfeastings and a solemn libation of wine set up a new boundary stone.\r\nAt another time the dispute shifted to where at the west gate of the\r\ntown the river wound with uncertain and changing course that left\r\nfrontiers vague and undefined. A low marshy ground called the “Rosiers”\r\nwas claimed by the mayor as under his jurisdiction, while the prior\r\nasserted that it was within the county of Kent; and for thirty years\r\nthe question was fought out in the law courts. On July 16th, 1500, the\r\nmayor definitely asserted his pretensions by gathering two hundred\r\nfollowers arrayed in manner of war to march out to the Rosiers. There\r\ncertain monks and servants of the prior were taking the air; one\r\nprotested he had been “late afore sore sick and was walking in the\r\nfield for his recreation”; another had a sparrow-hawk on his fist, and\r\nthe servants declared they were but peaceful haymakers; but all had\r\napparently gone out ready for every emergency, for at the appearance\r\nof the enemy bows and arrows, daggers, bills, and brigandiers, were\r\nproduced from under the monks’ frocks and the smocks of the haymakers.\r\nIn the battle that followed the monks were beaten, and the citizens cut\r\ndown willows and stocked up the dyke made in the river by the convent;\r\nand boldly proceeded the next day[243] to other outrages. The matter\r\nwas brought to judgement, and a verdict given against the mayor for\r\nriot—a verdict which that official, however, lightly disregarded.\r\nIt was in vain that the prior, wealthy and powerful as he was, and\r\naccustomed to so great influence at court, appealed to the Star Chamber\r\nto have the penalty enforced, for no further steps were taken by the\r\ngovernment. It probably judged wisely, since in such a matter the\r\ntemper of the citizens ran high; and the rectification of frontiers\r\nwas resented as stoutly as a new delimitation of kingdoms and empires\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nIV. Resolution in the defence of their territory was no doubt quickened\r\nby the sense which every burgess shared of common property in the\r\nborough. The value of woodland and field and meadow which made up the\r\n“common lands” was well understood by the freeman who sent out his\r\nsheep or cows to their allotted pasture, or who opened the door of his\r\nyard in the early morning when the common herd went round the streets\r\nto collect the swine and drive them out on the moor till evening.[244]\r\nThe men of Romney did not count grudgingly their constant labour and\r\ncost in measuring and levelling and draining the swamps belonging to\r\ntheir town and protecting them from the encroachments of “the men of\r\nthe marsh” beyond, for the sake of winning grazing lands for their\r\nsheep, and of securing a “cow-pull” of swans or cygnets for their lord\r\nthe archbishop[245] when it was desirable “to have his friendship.” In\r\npoor struggling boroughs like Preston, in large and wealthy communities\r\nlike Nottingham, in manufacturing towns like Worcester with its\r\nbusy population of weavers, in rich capitals like York, in trading\r\nports like Southampton where the burghers had almost forgotten the\r\nfree traditions of popular government, the inhabitants never relaxed\r\ntheir vigilance as to the protection of their common property.[246]\r\nThey assembled year after year to make sure that there had been no\r\ndiminishing of their rights or alienation of their land, or that in the\r\nperiodical allotments the best fields and closes had not fallen to\r\nthe share of aldermen and councillors; and by elaborate constitutional\r\nchecks, or if these failed, by “riotous assembly and insurrection,”\r\nthey denounced every attempt at encroachment on marsh or pasture.\r\n\r\nV. So also in the case of other property which corporations held for\r\nthe good of the community—fisheries, warrens, salt-pits, pastures\r\nreclaimed from the sea, plots of ground saved in the dry bed of a\r\nriver, building sites and all waste places within the town walls,\r\nwarehouses and shops and tenements, inns and mills, the grassy slopes\r\nof the city ditch which were let for grazing, the towers of the\r\ncity walls leased for dwelling-houses or store rooms, any property\r\nbequeathed to the community for maintaining the poor or repairing\r\nthe walls or paying tolls and taxes all this corporate wealth which\r\nlightened the burdens of the taxpayer was a matter of concern to\r\nevery citizen. The people were themselves joint guardians of the town\r\ntreasure. Representatives chosen by the burghers kept one or two of the\r\nkeys of the common chest, which could only be opened therefore with\r\ntheir consent.[247] Year after year mayor or treasurers were by the\r\ntown ordinances required to present their accounts before the assembly\r\nof all the people “in our whole community, by the tolling of the\r\ncommon bell calling them together for that intent”[248]—an assembly\r\nthat perhaps gathered in the parish church in which seats were set up\r\nfor the occasion at the public expense.[249] There the people heard\r\nthe list of fines levied in the courts; of tolls in the market, or\r\ntaxes taken at the gates or in the harbour; of the “maltodes,” or sums\r\npaid on commodities for sale; of the “scot” levied on the property of\r\nindividuals; of the “lyvelode” or livelihood, an income tax on rates or\r\nprofits earned. They learned what means the corporation had taken of\r\nincreasing the common revenue; whether it had ordered a “church-ale,”\r\nor an exhibition of dancing girls, or a play of Robin Hood;[250] what\r\npoor relief had been given in the past year;[251] what public loans\r\nwith judicious usury of over ten per cent., it had allowed, as when in\r\nLydd “the jurats one year lent Thomas Dygon five marks from the common\r\npurse when going to the North Sea, and he repaid the same well and\r\ntrustily and paid an increase thereon seven shillings;” or they were\r\ntold whether the Town Council proposed to do a little trading for the\r\ngood of the community; and how a “common barge” had been built with\r\ntimber bought at one town, cables and anchors at another, pitch and\r\ncanvas at a third; and how, when the ship was finished, the corporation\r\npaid for a modest supply of “bread and ale the day the mast was set in\r\nthe barge,” before it was sent out to fish for herrings or to speculate\r\nin a cargo of salt or wine, for the profit of the public treasury.[252]\r\n\r\nLessons in common financial responsibility had been early forced on the\r\nburghers everywhere by the legal doctrine that the whole body might be\r\nheld responsible for the debt of one of its members, while each member\r\non his part was answerable for the faults of his fellows, whether\r\nsingly or collectively. Thus when Norwich failed in paying debts due\r\nto the King in 1286, the sheriff of Norfolk was ordered to enter the\r\nliberty and distrain twelve of the richer and more discreet persons of\r\nthe community;[253] and when the rent of Southampton was in arrears,\r\none of its burgesses was thrown into the Fleet in London.[254] Under\r\nsuch a system as this the ordinary interest of citizens in questions\r\nof taxation and expenditure was greatly quickened. The municipalities\r\nwere stern creditors. If a man did not pay his rent for the King’s\r\nferm the doors and windows of his house were taken off, everyone in\r\nit turned out, and the house stood empty for a year and a day or even\r\nlonger before the doors might be redeemed in full court, or before\r\nit passed to the next heir.[255] But it was probably rather owing to\r\nthe happy circumstances of the English towns than to the vigilance\r\nof the burghers that there is no case in England of a disaster which\r\nwas but too common in France—the disaster of a borough falling into\r\nbankruptcy, and through bankruptcy into servitude and political ruin.\r\n\r\nVI. In the town communities of the middle ages all public works were\r\ncarried out by what was in fact forced labour of the whole commonalty.\r\nIf the boroughs suffered little from government interference neither\r\ncould they look for help in the way of state aid or state loans;\r\nand as the burgher’s purse in early days was generally empty he had\r\nto give of the work of his hands for the common good. In Nottingham\r\n“booners”—that is the burgesses themselves or substitutes whom they\r\nprovided to take their place—repaired the highways and kept the\r\nstreets in order.[256] The great trench dug at Bristol to alter the\r\ncourse of the Frome was made “by the manœuvre of all the commonalty\r\nas well of Redcliffe ward as of the town of Bristol.[257] When Hythe\r\nin 1412 sent for a Dutch engineer to make a new harbour, all the\r\ninhabitants were called out in turn to help at the “Delveys” or\r\ndiggings. Sundays and week days alike the townsmen had to work, dining\r\noff bread and ale provided by the corporation for the diggers, and\r\nif they failed to appear they were fined fourpence a day.[258] In\r\nthe same way Sandwich engaged a Hollander to superintend the making\r\nof a new dyke for the harbour; the mayor was ordered to find three\r\nworkmen to labour at it, every jurat two, and each member of the\r\nCommon Council one man; while all other townsmen had to give labour\r\nor find substitutes according to their ability. The jurats were made\r\noverseers, and were responsible for the carrying out of the work; and\r\nso successfully was the whole matter managed that in 1512 the Sandwich\r\nhaven was able to give shelter to 500 or 600 hoys.\r\n\r\nForced labour such as this could of course only be applied to works\r\nwhere skilled artificers were not necessary; but occasions soon\r\nmultiplied when the town mob had to be replaced by trained labourers,\r\nand we already see traces of a transitional system in the making of the\r\nHythe harbour, where the municipality had to engage hired labour for\r\nsuch work as could not be done by the burgesses.[259] But undertakings\r\nfor which scientific skill was needed sorely taxed local resources, and\r\nthe burghers were driven to make anxious appeals to public charity.\r\nIn 1447, when Bridport wanted to improve its harbour, collectors were\r\nsent all over the country to beg for money; indulgences of forty or a\r\nhundred days were promised to subscribers by archbishops and bishops;\r\nand a copy of the paper carried by one of the collectors gives the\r\nsum of the masses said for them in the year as amounting to nearly\r\nfour thousand: “the sum of all other good prayers no man knoweth save\r\nonly God alone.”[260] The building and repairing of bridges as being\r\nalso work that demanded science and skilled labour involved serious\r\ncost. When the King had allowed the bridge at Nottingham to fall into\r\nthe river, he generously transferred its ownership and the duty of\r\nsetting it up again to the townspeople; who appointed wardens and\r\nkept elaborate accounts and bore grievous anxiety, till finding its\r\ncharges worse than all their ordinary town expenses they at last fell\r\nto begging also. So also the mayor of Exeter prayed for help in the\r\nmatter of the bridge there, which had been built by a wealthy mayor\r\nand was “of the length or nigh by, and of the same mason work as\r\nLondon Bridge, housing upon except; the which bridge openly is known\r\nthe greatest costly work and most of alms-deeds to help it in all the\r\nwest part of England.”[261] Such instances reveal to us the persistent\r\ndifficulties that beset a world where primitive methods utterly failed\r\nto meet new exigencies, and where the demand for technical quality in\r\nwork was beginning to lead to new organizations of labour. Meanwhile\r\nthe burghers had to fight their own way with no hope of grants in aid\r\nfrom the state, and little to depend on save the personal effort of the\r\nwhole commonalty.\r\n\r\nVII. The townspeople all took their part not only in the serious and\r\nresponsible duties of town life but apparently in an incessant round of\r\ngaieties as well. All the commons shared in supporting the minstrels\r\nand players of the borough. The “waits” (so called from the French word\r\nguet) were originally and still partly remained watchmen of the town,\r\nbut it was in their character of minstrels, “who go every morning about\r\nthe town piping,” that they were paid by pence collected by the wardmen\r\nfrom every house.[262] Every town moreover had its particular play,\r\nwhich was acted in the Town Hall, or the churchyard, before the Mayor\r\nand his brethren sitting in state, while the whole town kept holiday.\r\nIn 1411 there was a great play, _From the Beginning of the World_, at\r\nthe Skinner’s well in London, “that lasted seven days continually, and\r\nthere were the most part of the lords and gentles of England.”[263] At\r\nCanterbury the chief play was naturally _The Martyrdom of S. Thomas_.\r\nThe cost is carefully entered in the municipal account books—charges\r\nfor carts and wheels, flooring, hundreds of nails, a mitre, two bags\r\nof leather containing blood which was made to spout out at the murder,\r\nlinen cloth for S. Thomas’ clothes, tin foil and gold foil for the\r\narmour, packthread and glue, coal to melt the glue, alb and amys,\r\nknights’ armour, the hire of a sword, the painting of S. Thomas’ head,\r\nan angel which cost 22d., and flapped his wings as he turned every way\r\non a hidden wynch with wheels oiled with soap. When all was over the\r\nproperties of the pageant were put away in the barn at S. Sepulchre’s\r\nNunnery, and kept safely till the next year at a charge of 16d. The\r\nCanterbury players also acted in the _Three Kings of Cologne_ at the\r\nTown Hall, where the kings, attended by their henchmen, appeared\r\ndecorated with strips of silver and gold paper and wearing monks’\r\nfrocks. The three “beasts” for the Magi were made out of twelve ells of\r\ncanvas distended with hoops and laths, and “painted after nature”; and\r\nthere was a castle of painted canvas which cost 3s. 4d. The artist and\r\nhis helpers worked for six days and nights at these preparations and\r\ncharged three shillings for their labour, food, fire and candle.[264]\r\n\r\nMinstrels and harpers and pipers and singers and play-actors, who\r\nstayed at home through the dark winter days “from the feast of all\r\nSaints to the feast of the Purification,” to make music and diversion\r\nfor their fellow citizens, started off on their travels when the\r\nfine weather came, and journeyed from town to town giving their\r\nperformances, and rewarded at the public expense with a gift of 6s. 8d.\r\nor 3s. 4d., and with dinner and wine “for the honour of the town.”[265]\r\nIt was an easy life—\r\n\r\n  “Some mirth to make as minstrels conneth (know),\r\n  That will neither swynke (toil) nor sweat, but swear great oaths,\r\n  And find up foul fantasies and fools them maken,\r\n  And have wit at will to work if they would.”[266]\r\n\r\nEntries in the town accounts of Lydd give some idea of the constant\r\nvisits of these wandering troops, and of the charges which they made\r\nupon the town treasure.[267] Players from Romney came times without\r\nnumber, others from Rukinge, Wytesham, Herne, Hamme, Appledore, Stone,\r\nFolkestone, Rye; and besides these came the minstrels of the great\r\nlords, the King, the Duke of Somerset, the Duke of Buckingham, Lord\r\nDe Bourchier, Lord Fiennes, the Earl of Warwick, the Duke of York,\r\nLord Arundel, Lord Exeter, Lord Shrewsbury, the Earl of Pembroke,\r\nLord Dacres, etc.; all of whom doubtless the town dared not refuse to\r\nentertain, but “for love of their lords lythen (listen to) them at\r\nfeasts.”[268] Besides this Lydd had its own special plays, _The May_\r\nand _The Interlude of Our Lord’s Passion_, and the whole town would\r\ngather on a Sunday to hear the actors, while watchmen were paid to keep\r\nguard on the shore against a surprise of the French. Its players seem\r\nto have set the fashion in the neighbourhood; the Romney Corporation\r\n“chose wardens to have the play of _Christ’s Passion_, as from olden\r\ntime they were wont to have it,” and paid the expenses of a man to go\r\nto Lydd “to see the original of our play there,” besides giving the\r\nLydd players a reward of 20s. for their performance.[269]\r\n\r\nOther wanderers too knocked at the gates of Lydd—”the man with the\r\ndromedary,” a “bear-ward,” or the keeper of the King’s lions travelling\r\nwith his menagerie and demanding a sheep to be given to the lions;\r\narchers and wrestlers from neighbouring towns whom Jurats and Commons\r\ngathered to see, and supplied with wrestling collars and food for\r\nthemselves and their horses, as well as a “reward” at the public\r\nexpense.[270] Besides bull-baiting, Lydd, doubtless, like other towns,\r\nhad its occasional “bear-baiting.” There were the Christmas games and\r\nmumming, and the yearly visit of the “Boy Bishop”[271] of S. Nicholas\r\nwho came from Romney to hold his feast at Lydd. And there was the\r\nuniversal festival of the “watch” on S. John’s Eve, when Lydd paid\r\nout of its common chest for the candles kept burning all night in the\r\nCommon House, and for the feast—not a trifling expense if we may\r\njudge by the case of Bristol where the crafts who took part in the\r\nwatch divided among them ninety-four gallons of wine.[272]\r\n\r\nThis festival was observed everywhere, but other local feasts were\r\narranged according to local traditions. In Canterbury every Mayor\r\nwas bound “to keep the watch” on the Eve of the Translation of S.\r\nThomas. “And in the aforesaid watch the Sheriff to ride in harness\r\nwith a henchman after him honestly emparelled for the honour of the\r\nsame city. And the Mayor to ride at his pleasure, and if the Mayor’s\r\npleasure be to ride in harness, the Aldermen to ride in like manner,\r\nand if he ride in his scarlet gown, the Aldermen to ride after the same\r\nwatch in scarlet and crimson gowns.” The city was to be lighted by the\r\nMayor finding “two cressets, or six torches, or more at his pleasure,”\r\nevery Alderman finding two cressets, and each of the Common Council\r\nwith every constable and town clerk one cresset. In Chester the great\r\nday for merry making was Shrove Tuesday, when the drapers, saddlers,\r\nshoemakers and many others met at the cross on the Roodeye, and there\r\nin the presence of the Mayor the shoemakers gave to the drapers a\r\nfootball of leather “to play at from thence to the Common Hall.” The\r\nsaddlers at the same time gave “every master of them a painted ball\r\nof wood with flowers and arms upon the point of a spear, being goodly\r\narrayed upon horseback accordingly.” The whole town joined in the\r\nsports, and everyone married within the year gave some contribution\r\ntoward their funds.[273]\r\n\r\nTo these festivities we must add the yearly pageants of the\r\nGuilds—whether of the great societies like the Guild of St. George\r\nat Norwich,[274] whose Alderman in scarlet robe followed by the four\r\nhundred members with their distinguishing red hoods, marched after\r\nthe sword of wood with a Dragon’s head for the handle which had been\r\npresented to them by Henry the Fifth;—or of the Corpus Christi Guild\r\nwhich evidently played a political part in the life of every great\r\ntown. In York it is said to have had in the sixteenth century nearly\r\nfifteen thousand members, and at its great pageant, the Mayor and Town\r\nCouncil “and other worshipful persons” joined in a common feast, and\r\nsent wine and fruits at the public expense to great nobles and ladies\r\nin the city, till perhaps supplies ran out and the town was “drunken\r\ndry.”[275] The Craft Guilds also, whether voluntarily or by order of\r\nthe Corporation, had their pageants, acting the same play year after\r\nyear.[276]\r\n\r\nIt has been commonly supposed that the English people had in the later\r\nmiddle ages a passion for pageantry and display, which was one of\r\nthe strongest forces in maintaining their guild organization. But\r\ntowards the end of the fifteenth century at least it becomes less and\r\nless clear that the freewill of the craftsmen had much to say to the\r\nmaintenance of these public gaieties, or that they felt any enthusiasm\r\nfor amusements which yearly grew more expensive and burdensome.[277]\r\nThere were places where the crafts, whether through poverty or economy,\r\nneglected to spend a due proportion of their earnings on the public\r\nfestivals, and in one town after another as popular effort declined\r\nthe authorities began to urge the people on to the better fulfilment\r\nof their duties. In 1490 a complaint was made in Canterbury that the\r\nCorpus Christi Play, the City Watch on S. Thomas’ Eve, and the Pageant\r\nof S. Thomas had fallen into decay. Some Mayors indeed “in their year\r\nhave full honourably kept the said watch;” but others had neglected it,\r\nand “all manner of harness within the city is decayed and rusted for\r\nlack of the yearly watch.” It was therefore decreed that every Mayor\r\nshould henceforth “keep the watch,” and that the crafts who apparently\r\nhoped to escape from the heavy charges of these plays by declaring\r\nthemselves too poor to be formed into a corporate body, should\r\nforthwith be grouped together into a sort of confederation or give up\r\ntheir bodies for punishment.[278] In the same way when the tailors of\r\nPlymouth were incorporated in 1496, they had to bind themselves to\r\nprovide a pageant every year on Corpus Christi Day for the benefit\r\nof the Corpus Christi Guild,[279] and so on in many other towns.\r\nOccasionally indeed the Corporation took a different and more merciful\r\nline; for the Mayor and Sheriffs of Norwich petitioned the Lords and\r\nCommons to pass an Act or Order to prevent Players of Interludes from\r\ncoming into the city, as they took so large a share of the earnings\r\nof the poor operatives as to cause great want to their families, and\r\na heavy charge to the city,[280] and Bridgenorth got an order from\r\nElizabeth that the town might no longer pay players or bear-wards;\r\nwhoever wanted to see such things must see them “upon their own costs\r\nand charges.”[281]\r\n\r\nOn the whole it is evident that long before the Reformation, and even\r\nwhen as yet no Puritan principles had been imported into the matter,\r\nthe gaiety of the towns was already sobered by the pressure of business\r\nand the increase of the class of depressed workers. It was not before\r\nthe fanaticism of religion, but before the coming in of new forms of\r\npoverty and of bondage that the old games and pageants lost their\r\nlustre and faded out of existence, save where a mockery of life was\r\npreserved to them by compulsion of the town authorities. And the town\r\nauthorities were probably acting under pressure of the publicans,\r\nand licensed victuallers. Cooks and brewers and hostellers[282] were\r\nnaturally deeply interested in the preservation of the good old\r\ncustoms, and it was in some cases certainly this class, the most\r\npowerful in a mediæval borough, who raised the protest against the\r\nindifference and neglect of the townspeople for public processions and\r\nmerry-making, because “thereby the victuallers lose their money, and\r\nwho insisted on the revival of these festivals for the encouragement\r\nof trade. Probably where the crafts were strong and the votes of the\r\nworking people carried the day, the decision turned the other way.\r\n\r\nVIII. All the multitudinous activities and accidents of this common\r\nlife were summed up for the people in the parish church that stood in\r\ntheir market-place, close to the Common House or Guild Hall. This was\r\nthe fortress of the borough against its enemies—its place of safety\r\nwhere the treasure of the commons was stored in dangerous times, the\r\narms in the steeple, the wealth of corn or wool or precious goods[283]\r\nin the church itself,[284] guarded by a sentence of excommunication\r\nagainst all who should violate so sacred a protection.[285] Its shrines\r\nwere hung with the strange new things which English sailors had begun\r\nto bring across the great seas—with “horns of unicorns,” ostrich eggs,\r\nor walrus tusks, or the rib of a whale given by Sebastian Cabot. From\r\nthe church tower the bell rang out which called the people to arm for\r\nthe common defence, or summoned a general assembly, or proclaimed the\r\nopening of the market.[286] Burghers had their seats in the church\r\napportioned to them by the corporation in the same rank and order as\r\nthe stalls which it had already assigned to them in the market-place.\r\nThe city officers and their wives sat in the chief places of honour;\r\nnext to them came tradesmen according to their degree with their\r\nfamilies honourably “y-parroked (parked) in pews,” where Wrath sat\r\namong the proud ladies who quarrelled as to which should first receive\r\nthe holy bread;[287] while “apprentices and servants shall sit or stand\r\nin the alleys.” There on Sundays and feast-days the people came to\r\nhear any news of importance to the community, whether it was a list\r\nof strayed sheep, or a proclamation by the bailiff of the penalties\r\nwhich had been decreed in the manor court against offenders.[288] The\r\nchurch was their Common Hall where the commonalty met for all kinds of\r\nbusiness, to audit the town accounts, to divide the common lands, to\r\nmake grants of property, to hire soldiers, or to elect a mayor. There\r\nthe council met on Sundays or festivals, as might best suit their\r\nconvenience; so that we even hear of a payment made by the priest to\r\nthe corporation to induce them not to hold their assemblies in the\r\nchancel while high mass was being performed.[289] It was the natural\r\nplace for justices to sit and hear cases of assault and theft; or it\r\nmight serve as a hall where difficult legal questions could be argued\r\nout by lawyers. In the middle of the fifteenth century when the Bishop\r\nand the Mayor of Exeter were in the height of a fierce contest about\r\nthe government of the town they met for discussion in the cathedral.\r\n“When my lord had said his prayers at the high altar he went apart to\r\nthe side altar by himself and called to him apart the mayor and no\r\nmore, and there communed together a great while.” And on this common\r\nground the dean and chapter on the one side and the mayor and Town\r\nCouncil on the other, attended by their respective lawyers, fought out\r\nthe questions of law on which the case turned.[290] In fair time the\r\nthrong of traders expected to be allowed to overflow from the High\r\nStreet into the cathedral precincts, and were “ever wont and used ...\r\nto lay open, buy and sell divers merchandises in the said church and\r\ncemetery and special in the king’s highway there as at Wells, Salisbury\r\nand other places more, as dishes, bowls, and other things like, and\r\nin the said church ornaments for the same and other jewels convenient\r\nthereto.”[291] In a draft presentation to a London vicarage of 1427\r\nthere is a written memorandum with an order from the king that no\r\nfairs or markets shall be held in sanctuaries, “for the honour of Holy\r\nChurch.”[292] Edward the First had indeed forbidden such fairs in his\r\nStatute of Merchants, but such an order was little in harmony with the\r\nhabits and customs of the age; and if there was an occasional stirring\r\nof conscience in the matter, it was not till the time of Laud that the\r\npublic attained to a conviction, or acquiesced in an authoritative\r\nassertion, that the church was desecrated by the transaction in it of\r\ncommon business.[293]\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages however the townspeople were connected with their\r\nparish church after a fashion which has long been unknown among us.\r\nThey were frequently the lay rectors; they appointed the wardens and\r\nchurchwardens; they had control of the funds, and the administration\r\nof lands left for maintaining its services and fabric; sometimes they\r\nlaid claim to the fees paid for masses.[294] The popular interest might\r\neven extend to the criticism and discipline of the rector; so that\r\nin Bridport an enquiry of the bishop as to whether his chaplain, “a\r\nforeigner from Britanny,” was “drunk every day” was held in presence of\r\n“a copious multitude of the parishioners,” and twelve townsmen acted as\r\nwitnesses.[295] If a religious guild had become identified with the\r\ncorporation, the town body and the Church were united by a yet closer\r\ntie. The corporation of Plymouth, which on its other side was the Guild\r\nof our Lady and St. George, issued its instructions even as to the use\r\nof vestments in St. Andrews, ruling when “the best copes and vestments”\r\nshould be used at funerals, and how “the second blue copes” only might\r\nbe displayed at the burial of any man who died without leaving to the\r\nChurch an offering of twenty shillings.[296]\r\n\r\nThe people on their side were taxed, and heavily taxed, for the various\r\nexpenses of the Church.[297] Sergeants sent by the Town Council\r\ncollected under severe penalties the dues for the blessed bread and\r\n“trendilles” of wax, or “light-silver” for the lights burned beside\r\ndead bodies laid in the church; and the town treasury paid for “coals\r\nfor the new fire on Easter Eve.”[298] If a church had to be repaired or\r\nrebuilt the pressure of spiritual hopes or fears, the habit of public\r\nduty, the boastfulness of local pride, all the influences that might\r\nstimulate the common effort, were raised to their highest efficiency\r\nby the watchful care of the corporation. All necessary orders were\r\nsent out by the mayor, who with the Town Council determined the share\r\nwhich the inhabitants were to take in the work; and in small and\r\ndestitute parishes where the principle of self-help and independence\r\nwas quite as fully recognized as it was in bigger and richer towns,\r\nreal sacrifices were demanded. Men gave their money or their labour or\r\nthe work of their horse and cart, or they offered a sheep or fowls,\r\nor perhaps rings and personal ornaments.[299] In the pride of their\r\ngrowing municipal life the poorest boroughs built new towers and hung\r\nnew chimes worthy of the latest popular ideals. The inhabitants of\r\nTotnes were so poor that in 1449 there were only three people in the\r\ntown who paid as much as twentypence for the tax of half-tenths and\r\nfifteenths for the King. But since Totnes had four new bells which had\r\nbeen anointed and consecrated in 1442, it decided that the old wooden\r\nbelfry of the parish church should be replaced by a new stone tower.\r\nA master mason was appointed in 1448, and “supervisors” were chosen\r\nto visit the bell towers of all the country round and to make that\r\nat Totnes “according to the best model.” The proctors of the church\r\nprovided shovels and pick-axes, and the parishioners were called out to\r\ndig stones from the quarry; every one who had a horse was to help in\r\ncarrying the stones, “but without coercion,” while “those who have no\r\nhorses of their own are to work with the horses of other persons, but\r\nat their own cost.” Last of all an ordinance was made that the mayor,\r\nvicar, and proctors of the church should go round to each parishioner\r\nand see how much he would give to the collection on Sundays for the\r\nbell tower, and those who contributed nothing were to have their names\r\nentered on a roll and sent to the Archdeacon’s Court.[300] When St.\r\nAndrews at Plymouth was enlarged the town authorities decided that the\r\nmoney should be collected by means of a yearly “church-ale.” Taverns\r\nwere closed by order of the council on a certain day, and every ward\r\nof the town made for itself a “hale” or booth in the cemetery of the\r\nparish church. All inhabitants of the wards were commanded to come\r\nwith as many friends and acquaintances as possible “for the increasing\r\nof the said ale,” and to bring with them “except bread and drink such\r\nvictual as they like best”; but they must buy at the “hale” “bread and\r\nale as it cometh thereto for their dinners and suppers the same day.”\r\nAfter ten years of these picnics in the churchyard the new aisle of St.\r\nAndrews was finished at a cost of £44 14_s._ 6_d._[301]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this busy life—a life where the citizens themselves\r\nwatched over their boundaries, defended their territory, kept peace\r\nin their borders, took charge of the common property, governed the\r\nspending of the town treasure, laboured with their own hands at all\r\npublic works, ordered their own amusements, the mediæval burgher had\r\nhis training. The claims of the commonwealth were never allowed to\r\nslip from his remembrance. As all the affairs of the town were matters\r\nof public responsibility, so all the incidents of its life were made\r\nmatters of public knowledge. The ancient “common horn” or the “common\r\nbell”[302] announced the opening of the market, or the holding of the\r\nmayor’s court, or called the townspeople together in time of danger.\r\nCriers went about the streets to proclaim the ordinances of the\r\ncommunity, and to remind the citizens of their duties. From the church\r\nstile or in the market-place they summoned men to the King’s muster,\r\nor called them to their place in the town’s ship or barge; or if\r\ndanger from an enemy threatened, warned the citizens “to have harness\r\ncarried to the proper places,” or “to have cattle or hogs out of the\r\nfields.” They exhorted the people “to leave dice-playing,” “to cease\r\nball-playing and to take to bows;” to shut the shops at service time;\r\n“to have water at men’s doors” for fear of fire. The crier “called” any\r\nproclamation of the King in the public places of the town; he declared\r\ndeeds of pardon granted to any criminal, or proclaimed that some poor\r\nwretch who had taken sanctuary in the church had abjured the kingdom\r\nand was to be allowed to depart safely through the streets. Perhaps the\r\n“cry” was made that a prisoner had been thrown into the town gaol on\r\nsuspicion, and accusers were called to appear if they had any charge\r\nto bring against him; or it was announced that the will of a deceased\r\ntownsman was about to be proved in the court-house, if there were any\r\nwho desired to raise objections; or there was proclamation that a\r\nburgher had offended against the laws of the community and was degraded\r\nfrom the freedom of the town, or perhaps banished for ever from its\r\nterritory. At other times players and minstrels would pass through\r\nthe market-place and streets “crying the banns” of their plays. The\r\nmerchant, the apprentice, the journeyman, the shopkeeper, gathered in\r\nthe same crowd to hear the crier who recorded every incident in the\r\ntown life or brought tidings of coming change. News was open, public,\r\nwithout distinction of persons.\r\n\r\nWhere the claims of local life were so exacting and so overpowering\r\nwe can scarcely wonder if the burgher took little thought for matters\r\nthat lay beyond his “parish.” But within the narrow limits of the\r\ntown dominions his experience was rich and varied. While townsmen\r\nwere forced at every turn to discover and justify the limits of their\r\nprivileges, or while controversies raged among them as to how the\r\ngovernment of the community should be carried on, there was no lack of\r\npolitical teaching; and all questions “touching the great commonalty of\r\nthe city” for whose liberties they had fought and whose constitution\r\nthey had shaped, stirred loyal citizens to a genuine patriotism.\r\nTraders too, intent on the developement of their business, were deeply\r\nconcerned in all the questions that affected commerce, the securing\r\nof communications, or the opening of new roads for trade, or the\r\norganization of labour. In such matters activity could never sleep; for\r\nthe towns anticipated modern nations in the faith that the advantage\r\nof one community must be the detriment of another, and competition and\r\ncommercial jealousy ran high.[303] Never perhaps in English history\r\nwas local feeling so strong. Public virtue was summed up in an ardent\r\nmunicipal zeal, as lively among the “Imperial Co-citizens” of New\r\nSarum[304] as among the “Great Clothing” of bigger boroughs. In those\r\ndays indeed busy provincials but dimly conscious of national policy\r\nfound in the confusion of court politics and the distraction of its\r\nintrigues, or in the feuds of a divided and bewildered administration,\r\nno true call to national service and no popular leader to quicken their\r\nsympathies. Civil wars which swept over the country at the bidding of a\r\nfactious group of nobles or of a vain and unscrupulous Kingmaker left,\r\nand justly left, the towns supremely indifferent to any question save\r\nthat of how to make the best terms for themselves from the winning\r\nside, or to use the disasters of warring lords so as to extend their\r\nown privileges.[305] Meanwhile in the intense effort called out by\r\nthe new industrial and commercial conditions and the reorganization of\r\nsocial life which they demanded, it was inevitable that there should\r\ngrow up in the boroughs the temper of men absorbed in a critical\r\nstruggle for ends which however important were still personal, local,\r\nlimited, purely material—a temper inspired by private interest and\r\nwith its essential narrowness untouched by the finer conceptions\r\nthrough which a great patriotism is nourished. Such a temper, if it\r\nbrought at first great rewards, brought its own penalties at last,\r\nwhen the towns, self-dependent, unused to confederation for public\r\npurposes, destitute of the generous spirit of national regard, and by\r\ntheir ignorance and narrow outlook left helpless in presence of the\r\nrevolutions that were to usher in the modern world, saw the government\r\nof their trade and the ordering of their constitutions taken from them,\r\nand their councils degraded by the later royal despotism into the\r\ninstruments and support of tyranny.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\n There are many instances of the responsibility of individual citizens\r\n for costs of various kinds which were the charge of the whole borough.\r\n In 1212 the townsmen of Southampton got hold of the King’s money that\r\n came from Ireland, and two bailiffs and six principal men were charged\r\n with its payment to the King. (Madox Firma Burgi, 158.) A bailiff of\r\n Chichester was fined in 1395 for not attending at a session of the\r\n peace, and as he had no lands and chattels to seize for the debt, two\r\n citizens were charged with the payment of the fine. (Ibid. 187.) In\r\n 1256, when Warwick had to pay a fine of forty marks to the King for\r\n a trespass, the sheriff was ordered to raise the fine both from the\r\n townsmen and from all men of the suburb, both within and without the\r\n liberty, who did merchandise in the city of Warwick. (Ibid. 183.) In\r\n 1431 the bailiffs of Andover were held responsible for various escapes\r\n from prison. They were declared insolvent and the charge thrown back\r\n upon the town. The townsmen, however, pleaded that two of the officers\r\n charged had quite enough goods and chattels either in the town or in\r\n the country to pay themselves, and as for the third they had never\r\n chosen him. (Madox, 210. Other instances, ibid. 182, 184, &c.; Hist.\r\n MSS. Com. ix. 173.) In 1456 the Mayor and Common Council of Leicester\r\n agreed that all actions brought against them in the King’s Court by\r\n the bailiff should be paid for by the whole town. (Hist. MSS. Com.\r\n viii. 422.)\r\n\r\n This method of raising money was never a popular proceeding, and in\r\n almost every case where there is an account of goods seized from a\r\n community or guild for the payment of ferm or fine, the sheriffs seem\r\n to make the return that these goods remain on their hands for want\r\n of buyers. (Madox, 188, 212, 214, 217, 218.) It is evident that the\r\n responsibility of the private citizens was almost extinguished in\r\n later times (see Madox, 217), at least in some cases—a fact which\r\n may be referred to “the mayor and burgesses” replacing for official\r\n purposes “the community,” and being licensed to hold _corporate_\r\n property.\r\n\r\n It is necessary to distinguish between the responsibility for the\r\n _borough_ expenses and the responsibility for the _trading_ debts of\r\n the burghers. In the latter case the “community” was also responsible,\r\n but the guarantee was strictly confined to burghers and not shared\r\n by inhabitants. For the inconvenience to which burghers were subject\r\n by being seized for debts whereof they were neither debtors nor\r\n pledges, see Derby. (Rep. on Markets, 58.) Mr. Maitland points out\r\n that the doctrine that traders form a society in which each member\r\n is answerable for the faults of the others, which is shown in early\r\n charters, was gradually wearing out, and in 1275 a law was passed\r\n that no Englishman could be distrained for any debt unless he was\r\n himself the debtor or the pledge, though possibly this law still left\r\n members of a community in the position of pledges. But long before\r\n this law was passed all the bigger towns had already obtained charters\r\n to the same effect. See the charter of Norwich in 1255. “We have\r\n granted, and by this our Charter confirmed, to our beloved citizens of\r\n Norwich, that they and their heirs for ever shall have this liberty\r\n through all our land and power, viz. that they or their goods found\r\n in whatever places in our power shall not be arrested for any debt\r\n of which they shall not be sureties or principal debtors.” (Stanley\r\n _v._ Mayor, Norwich Doc. 1884, 7.) In 1256 goods belonging to the\r\n Norwich freemen were arrested for the debts of others that were not\r\n free at Boston fair. Norwich however produced its charter of the year\r\n before, making their goods free from arrest for any debt unless they\r\n were the principal debtors, _or the debtors were of their society_.\r\n (Blomefield, iii. 50, 51.)\r\n\r\n Mr. Maitland (Select Pleas in Manorial Courts, Selden Society, ii.\r\n 134-5) in discussing this question of the trading guarantee points out\r\n the difference between the responsibility of the “communitas” and of\r\n the “cives” or “burgesses” of a town, showing that the “communitas”\r\n did not form a juristic person, while “the citizens” of a town could\r\n sue and be sued collectively by a common name. He thinks that the\r\n “communitas” may mean the merchant guild “though not perhaps in all\r\n cases a duly chartered guild.” Of this there is no proof, and many\r\n serious difficulties lie in the way of accepting the hypothesis. In\r\n the case of Leicester, where there was a merchant guild, it is never\r\n mentioned, the responsibility lies on the “members of the community\r\n of Leicester,” (p. 145-7) and Thomas pleads, not that he was not\r\n in the merchant guild, but that he was from Coventry. So also “the\r\n whole community of Norwich” is spoken of in exactly the same way,\r\n but in Norwich there was _no_ guild merchant, (p. 149, 152. See also\r\n on this point Hudson’s Mun. Org. 36. Notes on Norwich in the Norfolk\r\n Archæology, xii. “The city and feudalism.”) In Nottingham, John\r\n Beeston (p. 153-4) brings a counter-charge against the community of\r\n Stamford, (p. 159); he was probably one of the very numerous licensed\r\n traders of Nottingham and not a burgher. (Nott. Rec. ii. 102-4, 240-4;\r\n iii. 349-52.) It is important to notice the words of the charter by\r\n which in 1255 the Nottingham burghers had obtained freedom from\r\n arrest, “except in case the debtors are of their commune and power,\r\n having whereof their debts may be wholly or partly satisfied, and the\r\n said burgesses shall have failed in doing justice to the creditors of\r\n the same debtors.” (Nott. Rec. i. 41.) For Wiggenhall, (Select Pleas,\r\n pp. 157-8.) The mutual responsibility must be considered in connection\r\n with the inter-municipal treaties (see Vol. ii. ch. iii.) which were\r\n always drawn up in the name of “the community” at this early time,\r\n and never at _any_ time in the name of the guild merchant. I have\r\n suggested in vol. ii. (see Norwich, Lynn, Nottingham, Southampton)\r\n another meaning of “communitas,” which seems to me to apply also to\r\n the instances here mentioned by Mr. Maitland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE TOWNSPEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nNO dispute has raged more fiercely in this century, not only in England\r\nbut throughout Europe, than the dispute as to what qualifications\r\nshould make a man fit to take part in the government of his state. The\r\npossession of property in land, a fixed yearly income, birth into a\r\ncertain rank, a standard of age, some degree of education—these and\r\nother tests of merit have been applied in the hope of securing that\r\nevery active citizen shall be distinguished by a fitting capacity,\r\nwhether proved by his own attainments or guaranteed by the virtues or\r\nthe prosperity of his ancestors. But the anxieties and cares of great\r\nstates in this matter are only the repetition on a grand scale of the\r\nperplexities that beset the humble communities who first tried to solve\r\nthe problem of how a society of freemen could best rule themselves. In\r\nthe early “communitas” of the village or town out of which the later\r\nchartered borough was to grow—a community which possessed common\r\nfields or customary rights of common over surrounding meadows, and\r\nwhich had doubtless found some regular system for the management of its\r\nown affairs[306]—the obvious course was to count as the responsible\r\nmen of the township the land-holders who had a share in the common\r\nproperty; and when the community had received the charter which made\r\nit into a free borough the same system was naturally continued. Those\r\nwho owned a house and a certain amount of land, measured according to\r\nthe custom of the borough, formed the society of burghers,[307] and\r\nto the townspeople, as to Swift centuries later, the definition of law\r\nwas “the will of the majority of those who have the property in land.”\r\nEquality of possessions brought with it equality of civil rights, and\r\neach community formed a homogeneous body whose members were all subject\r\nto the same conditions and shared in the same interests. When the\r\nburgher’s life was over, the son who inherited his property appeared\r\nbefore the bailiffs within forty days, to deliver up to them his\r\nfather’s sword and take the freeman’s oath;[308] and the common life\r\nwent on undisturbed by the intrusion of any foreign element, vagrant,\r\nrestless, encroaching.\r\n\r\nBut such simple conditions of life, only possible in a stationary\r\nagricultural society,[309] disappeared when industry and commerce\r\nbrought their revelation of new standards of prosperity. In the course\r\nof a very few generations there was scarcely a trace left of that\r\nprimitive relation of equality out of which the early equality of\r\nrights had sprung. As the country folk migrated in increasing numbers\r\nfrom manor and village to the town[310] old rigid distinctions were\r\nswept away, and the simplicity and uniformity of the burgage tenure\r\nwas completely broken up. In Liverpool, for example, the burgages\r\noriginally established by John were already in the fourteenth century\r\ndivided into small fractions one-eighth or even one-forty-eighth part\r\nof their original size;[311] and the amount of land held by owners\r\nof property in Nottingham in the fifteenth century varied so much\r\nthat the taxes levied on them were in some cases as high as £3 14_s._\r\n7½_d._, in other cases as low as a farthing.[312] The owners of capital\r\nbegan to thrust out the owners of land; the shopkeeper replaced the\r\nagriculturist, the tradesman and the artizan exercised a new power, as\r\nthe boroughs quickly adapted themselves to the changing conditions of\r\nthe time and opened one door after another for the bringing in of new\r\nmembers whose wealth or whose skill might benefit the community. The\r\nownership of land still carried with it its ancient rights.[313] But\r\nthe son of a freeman who himself owned no land might be made a burgher\r\nin his father’s lifetime. Aliens might buy the franchise. Craftsmen\r\nwere admitted into the circle of the citizens.[314] Recruits from every\r\nclass and from every nation pressed into the ranks of burgesses. There\r\nwere foreigners from Bordeaux or from Flanders or from Lisbon,[315] and\r\nIrishmen in abundance, in spite of occasional outbursts of hostility\r\nin which Irish burghers were deprived of their freedom, “till they\r\nbought it again with the blood of their purses, and with weeping eyes,\r\nkneeling on their knees, besought the mayor and his brethren of\r\ntheir grace.”[316] No limit was set, whether of race, or occupation,\r\nor descent, or wealth, if they “are born in the city and be of good\r\nreport, and if their presence may be profitable to the city as well as\r\nfor his wisdom, as also for any other validity or worth known to the\r\ncitizens.”[317] The new society took in alike traders, agriculturists,\r\nbondmen looking for freedom,[318] parish priests,[319] merchants who\r\nowned eight or ten ships and employed over a hundred workmen; small\r\nmasters with but a single journeyman or perhaps two; artizans just\r\nreleased from apprenticeship and enrolled as members of some craft\r\ngild; rich folk who held several burgages, and men who rented a tiny\r\nshop. Everywhere the town communities were fast outgrowing the old\r\nsimple traditions of common acquaintance and friendship, and throughout\r\nthe fifteenth century the seals of the frequent new comers were so\r\nunfamiliar to their fellow citizens that deeds of sale had constantly\r\nto be brought to the Mayor for the addition of his seal of office to\r\novercome hesitation and distrust.[320]\r\n\r\nThe hospitality of the corporations differed from place to place.\r\nSometimes a borough threw its gates wide open and welcomed any new\r\ncomer who would but choose one of the half-dozen avenues to citizenship\r\nthat lay before him,—who would buy land, or marry a free woman, or\r\npay the fixed price for his freedom, or serve his apprenticeship\r\nto a trade, or accept the franchise as a gift from the community;\r\nwhile a neighbouring town, looking on aliens with jealousy and\r\nhesitation, would close its doors and cling to some narrower system\r\nof enfranchisement which kept its ranks pure from foreign blood, and\r\nits burghers free from anxieties of competition.[321] Each community\r\nin fact had full liberty to order its own political experiment. In\r\nthe matter of choosing their fellow burgesses, of framing their own\r\nsociety and fixing the limits of its growth, the citizens knew no law\r\nand recognized no authority beyond their own,[322] and enjoyed herein\r\na measure of independence unknown in continental countries where a\r\npowerful feudal system still barred every road to freedom.\r\n\r\nWhen a new comer who desired to be “franchised for a free man, ...\r\nand fellow in your rolls”[323] was accepted by the commonalty he was\r\nsummoned before them in a public court, “having with them the common\r\ncharter of the city; and then the steward shall take the book, and\r\nbid them lay their right hands thereon, commanding all those that are\r\nstanding by, in the behalf of our Lord the King, to keep silence,” and\r\nthe oath of obedience to the King and fidelity to the customs of the\r\ntown was administered,[324]—perhaps, as at Winchester, the “oath to\r\nswear men to be free, kneeling on their knees.”[325] The candidate had\r\nfurther to find two or more good men as pledges that he would “observe\r\nall the laws;”[326] and to pay the customary fees, which varied with\r\nthe caution or the poverty of the borough from three shillings to five\r\npounds; while a poor corporation like Wells was content to receive its\r\npayments in wine or gloves or wax when money was scarce.[327]\r\n\r\nThe new burgess was then required to give security to the town for\r\npayment of taxes or any other municipal claims by proving that he had\r\neither a good yearly revenue or a tenement, or by at once building\r\nhimself a house.[328] A wooden framework was put together either\r\non some building ground or perhaps in a vacant space in the open\r\nstreet,[329] and was then carried to the new site. The interstices were\r\nquickly filled up with plaster, and the little tenement was complete. A\r\ncouple of rough benches and one or two pots and a few tools served as\r\nfurniture, and the new burgess entered into possession and began life\r\nas a citizen householder. Henceforth he was bound to live within the\r\nwalls of the borough, for his franchise was forfeited if he forsook the\r\ntown for a year and a day.[330] Over the house, which was the town’s\r\nsecurity for rent and taxes, the municipality kept a watchful eye: if\r\nit became ruinous and dangerous to the passer-by it was thrown down\r\nat the owner’s cost, or if needful at the cost of the commonalty; if\r\nthrough neglect or poverty it fell into decay the next heir and the\r\ncommonalty together could compel him to put it in order or give it\r\nup.[331] Once or twice a year the burgher had to appear at the Portmote\r\nor Borough Court to prove his presence in the town, and to take his\r\nnecessary part in the duties of the court.[332] An unwavering loyalty\r\nand public spirit was demanded of him, and the loss of “frelidge,”\r\nas they said in Carlisle, avenged any breach of public duty, such as\r\na refusal to help the Mayor in keeping the peace, clamour and undue\r\ndisturbance at the election of town officers, revealing the counsels\r\nof the Common Assembly, resistance in word or deed to the municipal\r\nofficers, contempt of the Mayor’s authority, or any offence for which\r\nthe punishment of the pillory or the tumbrill was adjudged.[333] For\r\nsuch things the burgher was “blotted out of the book of the bailiff”;\r\nand the forfeiture of his freedom was declared by open proclamation\r\nof the common crier, or by sound of the town bell, or by having his\r\nname written up on a Disfranchised Table in the Guild Hall,[334] so\r\nthat all the town should know his shame. In Preston those who betrayed\r\nthe municipal confidence or exposed the poverty of the town were not\r\nonly deprived of the franchise, but their toll was taken every day as\r\nof forsworn and unworthy persons who could not be trusted beyond the\r\npassing hour.[335]\r\n\r\nIt was no mean advantage to be a burgher in those days, when nearly all\r\nmaterial benefits and legal aids and political rights were reserved\r\nfor the favoured classes, and when it was the towns that opened for\r\nthe working man and the shopkeeper a way to take their place too among\r\nthe people of privilege. The burghers, of course, shared alike in\r\nrights of common and of pasturage on the town lands, of fishing in\r\nthe town waters,[336] of the ferry across the stream or sea channel,\r\nand so forth; but their pre-eminent privilege was the right to trade.\r\nIf ordinary inhabitants were allowed to buy and sell food or the bare\r\nnecessaries of life, all profitable business was reserved as the\r\nmonopoly of the full citizen.[337] Protected from the intrusion and\r\nthe competition of the alien,[338] he paid a reduced toll for his\r\nmerchandize at the entrance of the town; his stall in the market was\r\nrented at a lower price than that of the stranger; he had the first\r\nchoice of storage room in the Guild Hall for his wool or leather or\r\ncorn; the town clock which tolled the hour when the market might begin,\r\nstruck for the burgher an hour or two earlier than for strangers and\r\nvisitors.[339] If a travelling merchant brought his wares to the\r\ntown the citizen might claim the right of buying whether the owner\r\nwished to sell or no, and might insist on a share in the profits of\r\nany mercantile venture.[340] He alone might keep apprentices, and\r\nbecome a master in his craft. If he travelled outside his own town\r\nfor the purpose of trade he carried privilege with him everywhere, and\r\nconfidently claimed freedom from “pontage” and “passage” and “pesage”\r\nand “shewage,”—that is from tolls for crossing bridges, for passing\r\ninto a town, for the weighing of goods, for showing merchandize in the\r\nmarket,[341]—and from a host of similar imposts. Wherever he went he\r\nwas shielded by the protection of his fellow citizens;[342] if he had\r\nan action for debt in any other town he was granted common letters from\r\nthe Mayor and Jurats to assist him in his suit;[343] if any wrong was\r\ndone him they enforced compensation, or they avenged his injuries by\r\nconfiscating the goods of any merchants within their walls who had come\r\nfrom the offending town.\r\n\r\nLegal safeguards and privileges moreover fenced him about on every\r\nside. He could only be impleaded in the courts of his own town, and any\r\nfellow citizen who brought an action against him outside the borough\r\nmight be disgraced and disfranchised;[344] while the King himself could\r\nnot summon a burgher to appear before his judges at Westminster, save\r\non the plea that there had been “lack of justice” at the first trial\r\nin the court of his own town. No “foreigner” might meddle in any legal\r\ninquiry in which their houses and property were concerned;[345] while,\r\non the other hand, every citizen from twelve years old could serve on\r\njuries for the town business.[346] Peculiar favours were extended to\r\nthe burgher,[347] as at Worcester where there were special provisions\r\nto protect him from any wrongful fine by the bailiff,[348] and the\r\ncity sergeant had to do any legal business required of him at reduced\r\nfees; or at Canterbury, where special formalities of trial assured to\r\nhim a more exact and careful justice; or at Sandwich, where he could\r\nbe tried only before the mayor, and could not be summoned before his\r\ndeputy like a common stranger.[349] Everywhere he could claim the right\r\nof being separated from the common criminals and imprisoned in some\r\ntower or room in the Guild Hall used as the Freeman’s prison.[350]\r\n\r\nBut all these privileges were far from being a free gift to be enjoyed\r\nin idle security; and to each individual burgher the franchise\r\npractically meant a sort of carefully-adjusted bargain, by which he\r\ncompounded for paying certain tolls by undertaking to do work, and\r\nwork which might be both costly and laborious, for the community. The\r\nbody of citizens was but a small one, and every man in it was liable\r\nat some time or other to be called on to take his part in the public\r\nservice. Taxation for the town expenses, watch and ward, service on\r\njuries, the call to arms in defence of the borough, were incidents\r\nas familiar as unwelcome in every burgher’s life; but a more serious\r\nmatter was the summons to take office and serve as mayor or bailiff or\r\ntown clerk or sergeant or tax-collector or common constable—offices\r\nnot always coveted in those days, when the mayor was held personally\r\nresponsible for the rent of a town which was perhaps vexed with\r\npestilence or wasted with fire; when treasurers had to find funds as\r\nbest they could for too frequent official bribes or state receptions\r\nof great lords or court officers; when bailiffs had to meet the loss\r\nfrom failing dues and straitened markets;[351] when the boxes of the\r\ntax-collector were left half empty through poverty, or riots, or\r\ndisputed questions of market-rights;[352] and when the constable was\r\n“frayed” day and night by sturdy men, dagger in hand, ready to break\r\nthe King’s peace.[353] Many modes of escape were tried. The inhabitants\r\nwould refuse to take up the franchise, or they would leave the town\r\nfor a time;[354] an elected officer would plead a vow of pilgrimage\r\nto “S. James in Gallice;” or an influential burgess might obtain\r\nletters patent from the King which granted him freedom from serving\r\nany municipal office during his life.[355] But generally a heavy fine\r\ncompelled the submission of a refractory citizen, and in the last\r\nresort the community would apply for a writ against him from the Privy\r\nCouncil.[356] The town allowed no excuses, and everywhere the citizens\r\nwere forced by stringent laws to take on them the offices to which they\r\nhad been elected by their fellows. In Lydd an order was made in 1429\r\nthat any one who had been appointed by the bailiff or jurats to take\r\nany journey on town business should pay a fine if he refused without\r\nreasonable cause.[357] In the Cinque Ports generally if a citizen who\r\nhad been elected as mayor or jurat declined to serve, his house was\r\npulled down;[358] or as at Romney the bailiff with the whole community\r\nwent to his dwelling, turned himself, his wife, his children, and all\r\nhis household into the street, shut the windows and sealed the door,\r\nand so left matters until “he wished to set himself right by doing\r\nthe said duty of jurat.” In Sandwich again, “if a person when elected\r\ntreasurer will not take upon him the office he shall not be permitted\r\nto bake or brew, or if he does bake or brew the commons may take his\r\nbread and beer to their own use till he accepts the office.”[359] At\r\nthe worst, however, the burgher might thankfully remember that his\r\npublic duty practically ceased at the wall and moat that bounded the\r\ntown, and that when he had paid down his money towards the buying of\r\nthe town charter he was at least safe from the danger of being sent as\r\ntax-collector or constable or juror anywhere throughout the country\r\nround.[360]\r\n\r\nThe privileges and duties of the free citizen remained, however, the\r\nendowment of the few. That larger conception of the common rights of\r\nman which had begun to make its way in the boroughs, was checked and\r\nhindered at every turn by the complicated conditions of town life, by\r\nthe jealousy of established settlers as to new comers, the exclusive\r\ntemper which the crafts had begun to show, the terror of the trader\r\nbefore free competition, the imperfectly developed authority of the\r\ncorporations over the space within the town walls, where it had failed\r\nto break the barriers of feudal custom and the claims of ecclesiastical\r\ncorporations. Howsoever the towns widened their borders, there was\r\nstill a growing population which lingered just outside the circle of\r\nfree citizens, shut out by one cause or another from full municipal\r\nliberty. Settlers came who did not care to burden themselves with the\r\nduties and charges of citizenship; there were dwellers in churchyards\r\nand tenants of ecclesiastical estates, who carried on their business\r\nwithin the town liberties but remained without the town jurisdiction;\r\nlandowners from outside the walls brought their corn and wool to the\r\ntown market; traders came from time to time with wares to sell; there\r\nwere apprentices and journeymen, escaped bondmen, and country-folk\r\ncoming to look for work. As all of these alike needed the protection\r\nof the town, so the town needed their services; and by degrees their\r\nrespective duties and rights were laid down in charters, in ordinances,\r\nor in friendly compacts.\r\n\r\nI. Thus it came about that below the ranks of the burgesses, themselves\r\nsecure in their municipal supremacy, were ranged orders of men more\r\nor less highly favoured according to their degree. First came the\r\ninhabitants who had paid for special rights of trade in the town, or\r\nwere admitted as members of the Merchant Guild. In times of commercial\r\nprosperity when wandering dealers and artizans were attracted to\r\nsome thriving borough for trading purposes they went to swell this\r\nclass of independent inhabitants, subject to the jurisdiction of the\r\ntown courts, but taking no part in its politics;[361] so that it\r\noccasionally happened, as in Norwich and Worcester, that the town\r\nrefused to harbour this body of irresponsible inhabitants and passed\r\na law ordering them to become citizens.[362] When on the other hand\r\ntrade declined and poverty settled down on the town, as in Romney\r\nand Winchester, the failing fortunes of the people were marked by a\r\nsteady decrease of the class of “advocantes,” or those who would “avow”\r\nthemselves freemen, and inhabitants who in their distress refused\r\nor renounced the franchise,[363] were driven into the ranks of the\r\npolitically unfree.\r\n\r\nII. So long as the trading inhabitants owned the jurisdiction of the\r\ntown courts their presence brought no serious difficulty to the ruling\r\nauthorities. But within the town walls there were other groups of men\r\nwho lay beyond this jurisdiction, and held an ambiguous position which\r\nwas the source of many a quarrel for ascendency and many a struggle\r\nfor license in the course of the fifteenth century. These were the\r\ntenants and dependants of bishop or abbot, of some lay lord, or of the\r\nking’s castle—men who lived within the liberties of the borough and\r\nwho had the right of trading in the town, but who were bound to do\r\nsuit and service at the courts of their own special lord.[364] To some\r\nextent they were forced to recognize the mayor’s authority, since their\r\nrights of trade were guaranteed by his protection, and since he yearly\r\nreminded them of his power to levy taxes on all property within the\r\nliberties of the borough. But their obedience was grudging and their\r\nloyalty was cold. The mayor could not awe them by a summons to his\r\ncourt, or enforce his demands with threat of pains and penalties; he\r\ncould scarcely terrify them into submission with his sergeant and a few\r\nconstables. By degrees, it is true, the tenants of the king’s castle or\r\nof feudal lords became merged in the general body of the inhabitants.\r\nBut the tenants of ecclesiastical estates[365] were maintained by\r\nlords who were bound by every tradition of their order never to yield\r\nup the least jot of authority to the secular power, and least of all\r\nto the secular power as represented by groups of upstart drapers and\r\nfishmongers and weavers whose humble shops and booths leaned against\r\nthe walls of the abbey or the priory, and whose pretensions, loud\r\nand noisy though they might be, were perhaps a century or so old at\r\nthe best. The ecclesiastical tenants therefore remained everywhere\r\nan alien body, no true partakers in the life of the town, and when\r\nsupported by a powerful bishop or abbot determined to crush the\r\npretensions of a struggling borough they proved a serious danger\r\nto municipal unity, and one which the authorities found themselves\r\npowerless to conquer till the Reformation settled the question for ever.\r\n\r\nIII. There was another class of privileged traders,—those who lived\r\naltogether outside the town,[366] who knew nothing of its courts, and\r\nbore none of its charges. We find everywhere these country traders\r\nunder various styles and with various privileges according to the\r\ntown’s discretion and convenience. Sometimes the citizens sold rights\r\nof trade to cultivators of the surrounding lands and occasional\r\nvisitors to fair or market, and nobles and landowners were ready to\r\ngive large yearly payments for freedom of the market and for the right\r\nof having granaries in the town. Peasants who owned a plot of land\r\njust outside the borough increased their scanty store by learning some\r\nlittle handicraft or doing a small trade in the town; or craftsmen\r\nsettled down beyond the boundaries to escape the town dues and live\r\nmore cheaply. At first the settlement of workmen and traders at their\r\ngates may have seemed a matter of small consequence, but as time went\r\non the danger which was hidden in these communities of free-traders\r\nbecame apparent. The manufacturer or dealer was able by one device or\r\nanother to protect himself against the enterprising man of the suburbs\r\nwho came in with his cheaper goods; it was the journeymen of the towns\r\nwho failed before the stress of the battle, driven back from their\r\npoor entrenchments by the masses who pushed forward on all sides to\r\ncontest with them admission into the lower ranks of industry where the\r\nscantiest skill sufficed to earn a bare subsistence.\r\n\r\nIV. Last of all came the non-burgesses, who had neither any share in\r\nthe government, nor any rights to rent a stall in the market, nor to\r\nown shop or workroom in the town. These formed an obscure company of\r\nworkers without records or history. They counted among their number\r\nancient burghers who had fallen into low estate and could no longer pay\r\ntheir burgage dues, as well as the poor who had never prospered so far\r\nas to buy a tenure or citizenship. But they were not all necessarily\r\npoor or miserable.[367] Rich merchants came from foreign parts to\r\nsettle for four or eight months at a time, as the law might allow\r\nthem, and bought and sold within the four walls of the room which the\r\nTown Council had ordered in some inn as their dwelling-place, with the\r\nhost standing at their elbow to witness every bargain. Foreign workmen\r\nsometimes came to settle, like the Flemish weavers in Bristol, or the\r\nDutch makers of canals and sluices whom we find in the towns of the\r\nsouthern coast. Companies of tilers or builders gathered in towns\r\nwhere stone houses were becoming the fashion, or where the Council\r\nhad issued an order that within the next few months every house must\r\nprovide itself with roof and chimney of brick or tiles.[368] The\r\nseaports had their uncertain element of sailors, “shipmen that had\r\nnought, and cared never an they were once on the sea whether they come\r\nagain or not,” and who at Yarmouth formed a riotous population, so that\r\nit was said that “no thrifty man would live in it.”[369] Labourers\r\nfrom the country came in to win freedom from serfage. Others came to\r\nlook for higher wages, and the hope which town life held out to the\r\nenterprising and the ambitious; so that in 1405 an Act of Parliament\r\ndeclared that the fields were deserted, and the “gentlemen and other\r\npeople of the nation greatly impoverished” by the labourers seeking\r\napprenticeship in towns, “and that for the pride of clothing and other\r\nevil customs that servants do use in the same.”[370] Children came,\r\nconstantly as young as seven, never older than twelve—when they were\r\nexpected to begin the work of life just as at that age their brothers\r\nof a better station took on themselves the duties of citizenship, for\r\n“every poor man that hath brought up children to the age of twelve\r\nyear waiteth then to be holp and profited by his children.”[371]\r\nThenceforward they had to fight their own way, looking for assistance\r\nnot to their fathers but to their patrons, “whence it proceeds that,\r\nhaving no hope of their paternal inheritance, they all become so greedy\r\nof gain that they feel no shame in asking almost ‘for the love of God,’\r\nfor the smallest sums of money; and to this it may be attributed that\r\nthere is no injury that can be committed against the lower orders of\r\nthe English that may not be atoned for by money.”[372]\r\n\r\nBut if apprenticeship ever brought with it “pride of clothing,” the\r\npoor working class of the towns fared roughly and worked hard among\r\nartizans who “hold full hungry house,” who know “long labour and\r\nlight winning,” who taste no wine from week to week, whose bed has\r\nno blanket, and on whose board no white bread ever comes.”[373] Once\r\nthis rough living and rougher toil had been a sure way of entering\r\ninto the privileges of municipal freedom. But even in the fourteenth\r\ncentury this was no longer the case. The poorer burghers opposed the\r\nadmission of new comers to share their common lands, and insisted on\r\nselling the franchise dearly. The crafts had already begun to form\r\nthemselves into close companies, and by prohibitive fines shut out all\r\nsave the descendants of their own members; while at the same time the\r\ncustom was growing up that the town franchise should be given only\r\nto those who were enrolled in a craft or trade guild; and strangers\r\ntherefore found the way barred against them; they could neither become\r\nmasters in their craft nor burgesses in their town, and went to swell\r\nthe general mass of journeymen and serving men. Moreover the Peasant\r\nRevolt had carried with it widespread terror, and from that time some\r\ntowns, as for instance York and Bridgenorth, refused to allow any born\r\nbondman, whatever his estate, to receive the freedom of the city. Thus\r\nfrom one cause or another groups of men were formed in the midst of\r\nevery town who were shut out from the civic life of the community,\r\nand whose natural bond of union was hostility to the privileged class\r\nwhich denied them the dignity of free citizens and refused them fair\r\ncompetition in trading enterprise. The burghers yearly added to their\r\nnumber half a dozen or perhaps even a score of members wealthy enough\r\nto buy the privilege, while the increase in the unenfranchised class,\r\nwhich had begun very early in the town life, proceeded by leaps and\r\nbounds; till presently the old balance of forces in the little state\r\nwas overthrown, the ancient constitution of a free community of equal\r\nhouseholders was altogether annulled and forgotten, and a comparatively\r\nsmall class of privileged citizens ruled with a strong hand over\r\nsubject traders and labourers to whom they granted neither the forms\r\nnor the substance of liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n_Bridport_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE comfortable independence in which the townspeople of the fourteenth\r\nand fifteenth centuries had stoutly entrenched themselves, was the\r\nreward of a couple of centuries of persistent effort, in which they\r\nhad steadily laboured at their double work of emancipation, freeing\r\nthemselves on the one hand from the feudal yoke, and on the other\r\nfrom political servitude. No independent life of the community could\r\narise so long as the inhabitants of a town acknowledged an absolute\r\nsubjection to their feudal lord, and bore the heavy burdens of\r\nservices and taxes which, however they might differ according to the\r\nusages of the several manors, weighed upon the people everywhere with\r\npersistent and intolerable force. The lord might destroy their industry\r\nby suddenly calling out the inhabitants to follow him in a warlike\r\nexpedition, or demanding services of forced labour or laying on them\r\ngrievous taxes; his officers could throw the artizan or merchant into\r\nhis prison, or ruin them by fines, or force upon them methods of law\r\nhateful and dangerous to their conceptions of a common life; as he\r\nclaimed supreme rights over the soil it was impossible for the burgher\r\nto leave his property by will; and on the tenant’s death officers\r\nvisited his house and stables and granaries to seize the most valuable\r\ngoods as the lord’s relief. It was necessary to gain his consent before\r\nany new member could be admitted into the fellowship of citizens;\r\nand without his permission no inhabitant might leave the borough to\r\ncarry on his trade elsewhere. He could forbid the marriage of children\r\narranged by the fathers, or refuse to allow a widow to take a new\r\nhusband and so make him master of her house and freeman in her town.\r\nHe fixed the market laws and the market tolls. He forced the people to\r\ngrind at his mill and bake at his oven.\r\n\r\nIf therefore the burghers were ever to develope commerce, or gather\r\nwealth, or form an organized society, or keep order in their streets,\r\nit was before all things necessary that serfs should be made into\r\nfreemen; and the first object of the town communities was to find\r\ndeliverance by purchase or negociation from those tyrannous usages by\r\nwhich their masters pressed most heavily on them. Vexatious feudal\r\nobligations were commuted for fixed payments in one town after another\r\nas their inhabitants grew rich and independent. A bargain was made,\r\nfor instance, with the lord of Preston that he should no longer summon\r\nany burgess to follow him on a warlike expedition which lasted more\r\nthan one day nor imprison on any accusation whatever a townsman who\r\nfound sureties; and he was forced to sell or renounce the right of\r\ncompelling the people to carry their corn to the lord’s mill or oven\r\nor kiln, and to allow any householder who chose to build an oven on\r\nhis own ground.[374] The burgher everywhere became the acknowledged\r\nguardian of his own children and might betroth them at his pleasure;\r\nthe right of widows to re-marry was secured against any interference\r\nfrom without; and absolute security was given to every citizen that\r\nunder no circumstances could his tenement or plot of ground be claimed\r\nby any superior lord.[375] When the burgesses of Hereford were asked\r\nby a neighbouring town to give an account of their constitution they\r\nproudly dwelt upon the freedom they had won. “We do not use,” they say,\r\n“to do fealty or any other foreign service to the lord of the fees for\r\nour tenements, but only the rents arising out of the said tenements;\r\nbecause we say that we hold our tenements by the service of burgage, or\r\nas burgesses, so that we have not any other lord between our lord the\r\nking and us.” “And we do not so use,” they add, “to give any heriot nor\r\nmortuary to any one at the death of any of the citizens dying within\r\nthe said city or suburbs, for any of his tenements.” Moreover “we say\r\nthat every citizen of the city or suburbs may give and assign their\r\ntenements freely and quietly as well in health as in sickness, when\r\nand to whomsoever they please, whether those tenements are of their\r\ninheritance or of their purchasing or getting, without any malicious\r\ndetracting of their lord, so that they be of such an age and no less,\r\nthat they know how to measure a yard of cloth, and to know and tell\r\ntwelve pence.”[376]\r\n\r\nIn these ways and in many others by which personal freedom was checked\r\nand thwarted, the rights of the feudal lord were irresistibly swept\r\naway by the pressure of growing societies of active traders and\r\nartizans.[377] But the need for political emancipation was no less\r\nurgent; and here the way to liberty was neither simple nor easy. A very\r\nhierarchy of powers held the path. The authority which the lord of the\r\nmanor did not assume was exercised by the sheriff of the county; and\r\nwhere the authority of the sheriff ceased the supreme right of the king\r\nbegan. All government and jurisdiction were divided among powers in\r\nhigh places; and whatever privileges the burghers might secure must\r\nbe won here a little and there a little, bought for money, or snatched\r\namid the distresses and calamities of their masters, or held as the\r\nreward of importunate persistence, the tribute to successful craft, the\r\nrecompense of some timely service rendered.\r\n\r\nThe case of Bridport illustrates the life of any provincial town in\r\nearly times whose burghers still served many masters.[378] It was a\r\nbusy little trading community in the thirteenth century. Hemp was grown\r\nin its fields which was sent to Plympton to be made into rope yarn,\r\nreturned to Bridport to be woven into ropes, and then sent back again\r\nto Plympton for sale, or fashioned at home into the girths, horse-nets,\r\nand reins for which the Bridport men were famous. The inhabitants had\r\nwon a considerable measure of self-rule. They elected the two bailiffs\r\nwho were at the head of their local government, presided in the\r\nlittle town court, and doubtless regulated the market and controlled\r\nthe trade. These two had under them under-bailiffs, cofferers, and\r\nconstables; and were assisted by twelve jurors chosen every Michaelmas,\r\nwho yearly perambulated the town to watch over its boundaries, and\r\nwho had charge of the “parish cheste” or coffin and the parish bier,\r\nand of the pillory, whipping post, and cucking stool. Twelve men were\r\nalso chosen to conduct any business in which Bridport was concerned.\r\nAt the visits of the king’s justices they were summoned with the clerk\r\nin council to assist in the business of the court; they represented\r\ntheir fellow burgesses if any question was called for trial before the\r\nsheriffs court at Dorchester, or if a dispute arose with the bishop, or\r\na settlement had to be made with the convent at Abbotsbury.\r\n\r\nI. The powers of the burgesses however were shut up within the\r\nnarrowest limits. At every moment of their lives some authority from\r\nwithout stepped in with rigorous control and ceaseless exactions. The\r\nLord of the Manor (who in this particular case was the king) owned the\r\nsoil of the town; therefore his Steward kept the Law Day,[379] judged\r\nthe petty offences of the townsmen, summoned them before him to see\r\nthat each was properly enrolled under the system of frankpledge, and\r\nswept their fines and forfeitures into the lord’s coffers.[380]\r\n\r\nII. Bridport further owed obedience to the officers of the shire.\r\nThe coroner[381] came to make inquisition in case of mysterious or\r\nviolent death or of fire, judged the cause, seized forfeited goods or\r\nchattels, and assessed the fines. The sheriff of the county exercised\r\na jurisdiction which extended over the most important affairs of the\r\ncommunity, and touched at every point the daily life of the burghers.\r\nThat his supervision might be constant and effectual, he was accustomed\r\nto appoint a deputy or under-sheriff to represent him on the spot,\r\ngenerally some man of importance in Bridport itself, who living in the\r\ncentre of the town could keep a close watch on its affairs and manage\r\nthem with a more exact control. It was the sheriff’s business to keep\r\norder, and guard against breaches of the king’s law. At stated times\r\nhe called the town bailiff and constable to appear at his court at\r\nDorchester; crimes which lay beyond the control of the manor court\r\nwere brought to judgment before him and fines, or the gifts that\r\naverted fines,[382] reminded the burghers of his power. As head of\r\nthe shire forces he ordered at his own will the muster-at-arms of the\r\ntownsmen, and in times of disturbance called out the levies for the\r\nking’s service; he fixed the number of archers and fighting men; he\r\nregulated the contribution of bows and arrows, of hemp and cord, of\r\ncorn or wine or fish. Year by year he assessed and levied the royal\r\ntaxes,[383] and collected the rent due from the borough to the king’s\r\nexchequer. Payments were not made in money in such a town as Bridport;\r\nso when the rent day came near the sheriff or his deputy first drew\r\nup a list of oxen and other goods which were to be given up by the\r\nvarious inhabitants and ultimately sold on the Monday after Palm Sunday\r\nfor the ferm. Meanwhile this list was handed over to the charge of the\r\n“bailiff-errant,” who travelled from town to town with his clerk and\r\ngroom[384] on the business of the shire; and certain citizens were\r\nmade responsible for the safety of the cattle and goods until the\r\nappointed day. The choice of goods to be taken from each person, the\r\nchance of accident before the day of sale, the naming of citizens who\r\nwere to bear the charges of making good any possible loss, the various\r\nfortunes of the auction and of the prices it might bring, the skilful\r\ncalculations necessary to ensure that however much the profits might\r\nexceed the needed sum they should never fall short of it—all these\r\nthings created at every turn new chances of corruption, new hopes\r\nof profit to those in authority, and new prospects of ruin to those\r\nunder the law.[385] The division of powers between the sheriff and his\r\ndeputies, and the practical impossibility of fixing any responsibility\r\nor of calling any one of them to account, left the inhabitants mere\r\ncreatures at mercy, subject to varied and fortuitous hardship; while\r\non the other hand the art of government became to every one concerned\r\nin it a mere business of self-preservation. When John in 1216 sent a\r\ncommission to collect the ferm of Northampton which had fallen into\r\narrears, the commissioner was informed that the king could not afford\r\npayment either for himself or for his servants, and that he must\r\ntherefore provide as best he could for their salaries and provisions\r\nout of the arrears of the ferm which he was sent to collect.[386] Such\r\na system quickened zeal on the part of officials, if it did not lighten\r\nthe troubles of the people. In those days every officer in the scale,\r\nfrom the sheriff to the constable, subject to the claims and exactions\r\nof his immediate superior, could only indemnify himself by exercising a\r\ncorresponding pressure on those below him, and passing on the tradition\r\nof fraud and tyranny.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to say whether the sheriff’s position as tax-gatherer,\r\nas judge, or as recruiting officer and military leader, gave him the\r\nlargest opportunities for extortion and tyranny; but so long as every\r\noffice that he held added new pretences for arbitrary interference,\r\nthe townspeople were driven to win his favour by frequent gifts,\r\nwhether to himself or to his wife, which indeed his deputies were\r\nstrict in levying when voluntary action proved tardy. He generally\r\nrequired a “year gift” from towns under his control, either to induce\r\nhim not to come within their liberties, or to remind him to “shew his\r\nfriendship” to the inhabitants in their necessities;[387] and it was a\r\ncommon custom, when money fell short, to make collection by means of a\r\n“scot-ale,”[388] and summon the townsfolk to a drinking feast where\r\nthey were bound to contribute a supply of provisions, and to spend a\r\ncertain sum at the ale-booths set up for the day, while the proceeds\r\nof the whole entertainment went into the sheriff’s pocket. Modes of\r\nextortion, however, might vary infinitely. In Canterbury the sheriff\r\nonce broke down the only bridge over the river, and so kept it for\r\nthree months, while he put a ferry boat on the water which the people\r\nwere forced to use and pay for on his own terms.[389] The confessed\r\nsuperiority of these officials in the arts of fraud and tyranny was\r\nproclaimed by the universal fear and hate which followed them—passions\r\nwhich break out in the popular ballads where by a traditional touch\r\nthe people’s hero, Robin Hood, is endowed with the hatred of all\r\nsheriffs; and which stir the heart of the writer of Piers Ploughman\r\nas he pictures these officers in the foremost place wherever there is\r\na gathering of the servants of corruption, and in his parable of the\r\nLady Meed travelling to the Court tells how it was a sheriff who was\r\nappointed to bear her softly in a litter from Assize to Assize with\r\ntenderest care for her safety, since “sheriffs of shires were shent\r\n(undone) if she were not.”[390]\r\n\r\nIII. The sheriff however was but the deputy of the crown, and the\r\nsovereign rights of the King lay behind and above all subordinate\r\nauthority whatever. When a royal messenger rode through the gates\r\nof a town the officers of the lord of the manor and of the shire\r\nalike acknowledged a higher law; and such messengers were not rare.\r\nThe sheriff’s accustomed rule was set aside whenever judges from\r\nWestminster sat in the church or the Guild Hall to administer the\r\njustice of the King’s Court. Sometimes the king’s escheator came to\r\ninvestigate into lapsed estates, to ascertain whether any socage\r\ntenants had died, and claim the customary fines.[391] From time to\r\ntime Court officials “carrying the mace of the lord the king” appeared\r\nto announce statutes or ordinances made in Parliament; or came as\r\nunwelcome commissioners to ask for benevolences and loans. The king’s\r\nclerk of the market[392] might ride into the town with a troop of\r\nhorses and followers carrying weights and measures signed with the\r\nsign of the exchequer; he would call for all the town measures, test\r\nthem by his models, see that the false ones were burned, and then\r\nclaim a fresh relay of horses to carry him on to his next stage. If\r\nthe sovereign chose he might send an officer under the assize of\r\narms to “sit at Bridport to array the men” and call for archers for\r\nthe king’s service; or in case of need the king’s “harbinger” or\r\n“sergeant-at-arms” came to judge how many soldiers should be billeted\r\non the inhabitants. In time of rebellion or civil war,[393] suspicion\r\nof disaffection might fall upon the town, and then commissioners\r\ntravelled from London to hold a special “inquisition” on the spot.\r\n\r\nIV. All these officers represented the king as supreme head of the law;\r\nbut other messengers came from the court, as unbidden and unwelcome as\r\nthe last, who claimed for the sovereign a tribute which belonged to\r\nhis personal dignity and state. When the monarch travelled he carried\r\nhis own law with him; wherever he went the steward and marshal of\r\nhis house had jurisdiction for twelve miles to be counted from the\r\nlodging of the king;[394] and their authority superseded all other law\r\nwhether of the borough or the shire. The marshal demanded such supply\r\nof horses as was necessary for the king or his messengers;[395] the\r\npurveyors and larderers and officers of the household levied provisions\r\non all townsfolk,[396] save the few who had been lucky enough to\r\ngain the king’s grant of protection,[397] seized what they needed of\r\ntheir corn and bread and salted meats, called out the inhabitants for\r\nforced labour, billeted the crowd that made up the royal train on the\r\nvarious householders,[398] and in fact governed at their own will any\r\ntown through which the king passed. A happy obscurity and distance\r\nfrom the court could alone preserve a little borough like Bridport\r\nfrom exactions of royal travellers; and its people might bear with\r\nresignation a poverty and insignificance which at least protected them\r\nfrom evils of so great magnitude to poor and over-tasked workers.\r\n\r\nV. There was yet another form in which the power of the crown pressed\r\nupon the inhabitants of a borough. Privileges granted by the king\r\nmight be withdrawn at his caprice; and the burghers lay absolutely\r\nat his mercy for all the liberties and rights which they enjoyed. At\r\nthe beginning of every reign the confirmation of their charters, and\r\nthe affixing of the new king’s seal, had to be won by such payments\r\nand bribes as the officials in high places judged that the burghers\r\ncould afford.[399] The king might at any moment raise a question as to\r\nthe value of their charters; or he might make some public revolution\r\nor local disturbance the occasion for a revision or a threatened\r\nwithdrawal of ancient “customs.”[400] When their rights were menaced\r\nthe townsmen had but one resource, and hastily met together, as in the\r\ncase of Bridport, to order by the “common assent” that reins and horse\r\nnets should be provided at the public cost and sent to London, for\r\n“furthering the common business.”\r\n\r\nFor the whole of this complicated system of administration was\r\nkept in working order by a generous system of bribes—bribes given\r\nlargely and openly, registered in the public accounts, and granted\r\nindifferently to any official, great or small, who might be induced\r\nby a timely gift to “show his friendship.” Towns won the renewal or\r\nthe preservation of their chartered rights by offerings to king or\r\nqueen, to chancellors and bishops and great officers of the household,\r\nwith whom they interceded by the aid of a “cow-pull” of swans or\r\ncygnets or heronshaws, a porpoise, a store of dried sprats, or a\r\ncask of wine. “The law is ended as a man is friended,” said the wise\r\nfolk of the fifteenth century, and if any legal question arose the\r\ntown could only “have a verdict” when due “courtesies,” as they were\r\ncalled, were prepared for justices and their clerks, barons of the\r\nexchequer and sheriffs and counsel and attorneys, besides any sums\r\nrequired to pay a “friendly” jury.[401] If the king sent pressing\r\nand overwhelming demands for money, a deputation of leading burghers\r\nwould hurry up to Westminster, carrying gifts and bribes to the Clerk\r\nof the Rolls and the usher of Parliament as a peace offering.[402]\r\nOr some gracious patron might be persuaded to divert from the town\r\n“a quest of the Admiralty, that it would not come thither as was\r\nintended to come.”[403] When men were called out for war the community\r\nwould consult by what gifts or “courtesies” it might arrange “to\r\nhave pardoning that we should not ride up so many men as the said\r\nwarrant commanded.”[404] At the appearance of the King’s harbinger or\r\nsergeant-at-arms the first thought was to collect a sum which might\r\ninduce their formidable guest to limit the number of troops billeted on\r\nthe town, or even to march them away altogether.[405] In the same way\r\nif a messenger appeared bearing part of the body of a traitor who had\r\nbeen executed, which by the King’s orders was to be set up on the gate\r\nof the borough, the inhabitants would give him a present to carry on\r\nhis burden to some other town.[406]\r\n\r\nCounted among the usual incidents of government, and reckoned in the\r\nordinary expenditure of the municipality, the payment of such bribes\r\nwas to all concerned merely the customary mode of defraying some of\r\nthe expenses of administration;[407] and the public sense acquiesced\r\nin a prudent and necessary method of carrying on the affairs of\r\nstate. Gifts to great officials were not tokens of servitude required\r\nonly from dependent towns, but a tribute levied as rigorously from\r\nthe free boroughs. The bribes demanded were not less in number; the\r\nmain difference was that they went into different pockets. Thus the\r\nofferings required from Canterbury when its municipal existence was\r\nmost vigorous and self-dependent, were naturally on a scale unexampled\r\nin a little place such as Bridport.[408] The gifts of the town were\r\nscattered far and wide; a pike to a London lawyer, wine to Master John\r\nFineux the justiciar, a conger eel to the Dean of Windsor, wine to\r\nthe chancellor of the Archbishop of York, payments to the Bishop of\r\nWinchester that the city might “have his mediation,” gifts to Cardinal\r\nBeaufort to win his help when it was proposed to change the municipal\r\nconstitution, offerings to the Bishop of St. David’s—who nominally\r\ngot a double supply, one present being provided for the Episcopus\r\nMenevensis and another for the Episcopus de Seynt Taffey[409] to “have\r\ntheir friendship” with the King in the anxious days of 1483. Royal\r\ndukes and court officers, bishops, chamberlains, notaries, clerks of\r\nthe Rolls, knights who had access to the palace, sheriffs, judges of\r\nthe king’s court, were sumptuously feasted, and messengers knocked at\r\nthe doors of their lodgings laden with pheasants, cygnets, capons,\r\nrams, oxen, geese, with Rhenish wine, wine of Tyre, claret, muscatel,\r\nand red wine and white by thirty or fifty gallons at a time. In the\r\nrevolutionary times of 1470 the citizens were unluckily associated\r\nwith the party of Henry the Sixth, and for years after their wealth\r\nwas lavished in buying back the favour of the court. The Duchess of\r\nYork, who had once been accustomed to receive her tribute of Rhenish\r\nwine, red wine, and wine of Tyre, visited the city in 1471, when her\r\nson was in difficulties; but the prudent citizens now only offered\r\nthe poor lady “for bread 12_d._” On the other hand when Edward was\r\nagain triumphant officers and commissioners of the king of every\r\ndegree accepted pheasants, geese, capons and red wine. The burghers\r\npresented to the Duke of Clarence a load of claret and capons which it\r\ntook four men to carry. Soon after when the King’s Chamberlain came\r\nto Canterbury, he was given his dinner at the “Swan,” one of the inns\r\nbelonging to the corporation, where he feasted off “a wild beast called\r\na bukk” which had been brought from Westen-hanger; and after the dinner\r\neight men carried a peace-offering to his inn, two swans, two fat\r\ncapons, four capons, four pheasants, fifty-six gallons of red wine, and\r\nhalf a gallon of muscatel; and shortly after another tribute was sent\r\nup to him in London.[410]\r\n\r\nBut behind this customary system of bribes and gifts lay the deep\r\nand permanent trouble of perpetual uncertainty and dread. Everywhere\r\nauthority came home to the unhappy subjects as a mere matter of\r\narbitrary and violent caprice, and the main function of government as\r\nthat of rough extortion and successful pillage; while the recognition\r\nof privilege on every side blotted out all sense of equality before\r\nthe law, and the weak, knowing all their helplessness, were as anxious\r\nto buy the commodity of protection, as the powerful, conscious of\r\ntheir might, were willing to make a gain of it. Canterbury sought the\r\npatronage of leading people in the county or the court;[411] Norwich\r\nprofited, so long as he was in favour, by the protection of Suffolk;\r\nYork gratefully recognised the services of the Duke of Gloucester. When\r\nhe passed through the city, an order was sent out by the corporation\r\nthat every alderman and council man in livery, and every member of any\r\ncraft in his best array, should go out to meet him at the gate—the\r\ncommoners being in their places by the early dawn, at three of the\r\nmorning, the grand people an hour later in consideration of their rank.\r\nIn 1482 the Duke acted as mediator between the city and the King in\r\nthe matter of the election of a mayor, and the council agreed that\r\nin regard of “the great labour of the good and benevolent lordship,”\r\nthat he “have at all times done for the weal of this city,” the whole\r\ncommunity should join in giving him “a laud and thank;” and the\r\naldermen dressed in scarlet, with the Council of Twenty-four in murrey\r\nor crimson, attended at the mayor’s house to present the Duke with a\r\ngift of all kinds of wine and fish, and lead a procession of the whole\r\ncommonalty to his lodging at the Friar Austins.[412]\r\n\r\nPatronage and protection, however, were dearly bought at all times,\r\nand at any moment their price, determined by the reckless habits of a\r\nlord, or the necessity of a king, or the greed of a sheriff, might be\r\nraised so as to bring years of confusion to municipal finances. Demands\r\nsudden and irregular, which no wisdom could calculate beforehand and no\r\nprudence could avert, wasted the substance of the people; and thrifty\r\nburghers learned to measure their progress to independence by their\r\nsuccess in limiting the pleas which the great could urge as reasons\r\nfor levying toll and tribute on their labour. The love of liberty was\r\nforced on them by the practical needs of life. A people long used to\r\nhardship, dependent on the capricious mercy of their masters, subject\r\nwithout appeal to impositions laid on them by the stronger hand, they\r\nlearned by daily experience that government by laws made without their\r\nown consent, and administered by officers imposed on them against their\r\nwill, was the very definition of slavery. By a rude experience of\r\nalien officials they were effectually taught that the first necessity\r\nof a free community was the right of choosing its own governors,\r\nthat the control of life and goods and the responsibilities of any\r\noffice of honour and profit and trust in the town should no longer\r\nbe entrusted to strangers, but committed into the hands of their own\r\nfellow citizens, of whose fidelity, patriotism, and credit they could\r\nassure themselves. It was impossible that all the fortunes of their\r\ncommerce should hang on the will of some distant master whose faculty\r\nof ruling them in all their concerns rested on the mere superiority\r\nof power; and traders everywhere demanded authority to order their\r\nown business, and rule their markets. The inhabitants of a town could\r\nnot claim the property in their own borough till they had secured the\r\nright of holding it directly from the crown at a yearly rent which\r\nthey themselves should pay into the exchequer at Westminster;[413]\r\nand even then their privileged existence was a mere matter of royal\r\ncaprice till they found means to have the corporate succession of the\r\nborough legally recognized.[414] Their municipality was threatened with\r\nfinancial calamities unless they could win exemption from the Statute\r\nof Mortmain, and obtain the right of holding property for the town’s\r\ngood.[415] The bondage under which they lay to the sheriff[416] and\r\ntax-gatherer could only be broken when they were given full powers to\r\nassess and collect all their own taxes.[417] Vexed and impoverished by\r\njourneys to distant courts for justice, harassed by the interference\r\nin their most private affairs of some far-off governor, forced in\r\nevery recurring emergency to carry appeals for justice or petitions\r\nfor favour to an alien power separate from all their interests, they\r\nurged the claim that right should be done to the burghers in their\r\nown courts and by their own officers as of the very essence of any\r\ntrue liberty. “We are the citizens of our lord the king,” said the\r\nburghers of Hereford, “and have the custody of his city for us and for\r\nhis heirs and for our heirs, and we ought not to go out of our city\r\nfor the recovering of our debts, for divers dangers and misfortunes\r\nwhich might happen to our wives and children; and if we ought to spend\r\nour goods and chattels in parts afar off, by impleading and labouring\r\nfor that, by that means and the like we shall be impoverished; and\r\nbeing made poor, we shall not have wherewith to keep the city, and so\r\ndisinheritance by such ways would easily fall upon our children.”[418]\r\nAnd as the burghers claimed that each community should have absolute\r\ncontrol over its members for the peace and order of the commonwealth,\r\nso they were resolute that no powerful patron, within or without the\r\nborough, should on any plea whatever venture to aid or “maintain” a\r\ntownsman who had offended against the municipal law, “because by such\r\nmaintainers or protectors a common contention might arise amongst\r\nus, and horrible manslaughter be committed amongst us, and the loss\r\nof the liberty or freedom of the city to the disinheritance of us\r\nand our children; which God forbid that in our days by the defect of\r\nus, should happen or fall out in such a manner.”[419] From the first\r\nthey were forced to look beyond the question of mere personal regard,\r\nseeing how deeply legal forms of procedure affected their common life\r\nas a separate society, and they had their grave reasons of state for\r\ninsisting that the older forms of administering justice in their courts\r\nshould be maintained, and trial by combat rejected and abolished from\r\namong them, “by reason of perpetual enmity of us the parents and of our\r\nchildren, which might turn to the ruin or perdition of the city and\r\nother innumerable accident dangers.”[420] In the same way they were\r\ndriven to realize the necessity of having some share in deciding on\r\nthe laws by which they were to be governed, and which might have the\r\ngravest results to their little state; as, for example, when the people\r\nof Leicester petitioned for a charter from Henry the Third to do away\r\nwith the ancient usage of “borough English,” and grant the right of\r\ninheritance to the eldest son, since owing to defective heirs and their\r\nweakness, the town was falling into ruin and dishonour.[421]\r\n\r\nAll these privileges and exemptions were matters of negociation\r\nbetween the borough and the king or the lord of the manor to be\r\nbought for money, or for political support, or for loans in time of\r\nneed.[422] The people everywhere simply won such advantages as time\r\nand opportunity allowed, and secured benefits which were measured\r\nby the grace of the king, or by the price they could afford to pay,\r\nor by the show of resistance they could make to their lord. Nor was\r\nthere anything startling or revolutionary about the first beginnings\r\nof independent municipal life. The town assemblies which discussed\r\nand inaugurated a new constitution transacted their business with a\r\ncompleteness and accuracy of methodical routine which might kindle the\r\nsympathy of a Town Council of modern Birmingham. In the organization\r\nof “meetings” the mediæval Englishman seems to have had nothing\r\nto learn, and the doings of the people of Ipswich when they got\r\ntheir first charter from King John in 1200 carry us into the quiet\r\natmosphere of a board-room where shareholders and directors of some\r\nsolid and old-established company assemble for business with the\r\ndecorum and punctuality of venerable habit.[423] The charter granted\r\nthose essential privileges which were recognized by all boroughs\r\nas of the very first importance—the right henceforward to deal in\r\nfinancial matters directly with the Exchequer, and no longer act as a\r\nmere fragment of the shire through the sheriff; to be free of tolls on\r\ntrade throughout the kingdom, and have a Guild Merchant with all its\r\ncommercial privileges; to carry out justice according to the ancient\r\ncustom of the borough; and to elect each year from among themselves\r\nofficers to rule over the town, who being thus appointed by common\r\nconsent could only be removed from office by the unanimous counsel\r\nof the whole people. The charter was given on May 25, and in the\r\nfollowing month a general assembly of the burghers was summoned. At\r\nthis meeting they first elected the chief officers for the year, the\r\nbailiffs and coroners, and then proceeded to decide by common counsel\r\nthat a body of twelve “Portmen” should be appointed to assist them;\r\nand three days later these too were formally chosen through another\r\nand more complicated system of election by a select body of citizens\r\nnamed for the purpose. Having taken an oath faithfully to govern the\r\nborough and maintain its liberties, and justly to render the judgments\r\nof its courts, the new officers then caused all the townsmen to stretch\r\nforth their hands towards the Book, and with one voice solemnly swear\r\nfrom that hour to obey and assist them in guarding the liberties of\r\nthe town. Twelve days after this they met to ordain the most necessary\r\nrules for the administration of the town. Two months were then spent\r\nin drawing up “Ordinances” which were finally solemnly read to the\r\nwhole people assembled in the churchyard, and received their unanimous\r\nconsent. And lastly a month later, on October 12, the organization of\r\nthe Merchant Guild for the regulation of trade was completed and its\r\nofficers elected; the newly made Common Seal[424] was inspected; and\r\nthe community ordered that a record of all their laws and free customs\r\nshould be written for perpetual remembrance in a roll to be called\r\nDomesday. And thus with all the grave ceremony which befitted the\r\ndignity of a new republic, Ipswich started on its independent career as\r\na free borough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBATTLE FOR FREEDOM\r\n\r\n(1.) _Towns on Royal Demesne_\r\n\r\n\r\nSO auspicious a beginning of municipal life as was granted to Ipswich\r\ndid not however fall as a matter of course to the lot of every English\r\ntown, nor was political liberty by any means an inevitable consequence\r\nof favourable commercial conditions, or necessarily withheld from\r\nboroughs in a humbler way of trade. In a society where all towns alike\r\ndepended upon some lord of the manor who owned the soil and exercised\r\nfeudal rights over his tenants, that which mainly determined for each\r\ncommunity the measure of independence it should win, and the price\r\nwhich its people should pay for liberty, was the form of lordship to\r\nwhich it was subject. By the decisive accidents of position and tenure\r\nthe fate of the town was fixed, rather than by the merits or exertions\r\nof the burghers.\r\n\r\nFirst among the boroughs in number and importance were those in\r\n“ancient demesne”—that is, boroughs which held directly from the\r\nking, and were therefore reckoned as being a part of the national\r\nproperty, such as Canterbury, York, Winchester, Southampton, Yarmouth,\r\nNottingham, Gloucester, and so on. A second group was formed by the\r\ntowns which belonged to a lay noble, like Morpeth, Berkeley, or\r\nLeicester; or were held by him as a special grant from the king, as\r\nBarnstaple or Liverpool. Finally there were the towns on ecclesiastical\r\nestates, whether they were the property of a bishopric like Lynn, which\r\nwas under the Bishop of Norwich, Wells under the Bishop of Wells,\r\nRomney and Hythe under the Archbishop of Canterbury; or whether they\r\nowed suit and fealty to a convent, as the towns of Reading and St.\r\nAlbans, which belonged to the abbots of those monasteries respectively,\r\nFordwich to St. Augustine’s at Canterbury, Weymouth to St. Swithun’s\r\nat Winchester.[425] In all these various groups the towns were equally\r\nwilling to relieve their feudal superior, king or lord or bishop,\r\nof the cares of government, and the only question was how far the\r\nking would go in supporting these demands, or how far the noble and\r\necclesiastic could be compelled to acquiesce in a re-distribution of\r\nfeudal jurisdiction and privileges in favour of traders and “mean”\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nHappily for the national wealth and freedom the great majority of\r\ntowns in England, and almost all those of importance, were part of\r\nthe royal demesne, and the king was lord of the soil. Fenced in by\r\nprivileges which had been devised to protect the interest of the King,\r\nand which they gradually found means to transform into institutions\r\nfor the protection of their own interests, the burghers on ancient\r\ndemesne were bound into one fellowship by the inheritance of a common\r\ntradition and common immunities;[426] and regarding their towns as the\r\nvery aristocracy among the boroughs, enjoyed a self-conscious dignity\r\nsuch as the Great Powers of Europe might feel towards the less favoured\r\nminor States. There is the ring of a haughty spirit in the answer sent\r\nby the men of Hereford when the people of Cardiff begged for a copy of\r\ntheir “customs” to help them in deciding on the constitution of their\r\nown government. “The King’s citizens of Hereford,” they say, “who have\r\nthe custody of his city (in regard that it is the principal city of\r\nall the market towns from the sea even unto the bounds of the Severn)\r\nought of ancient usage to deliver their laws and customs to such towns\r\nwhen need requires, yet in this case they are in no wise bound to do\r\nit, because they say they are not of the same condition; for there\r\nare some towns which hold of our Lord the King of England and his\r\nheirs without any mesne lord; and to such we are bound, when and as\r\noften as need shall be, to certify of our laws and customs, chiefly\r\nbecause we hold by one and the same tenure; and nothing shall be taken\r\nof them in the name of a reward, except only by our common town clerk\r\nfor the writing and his pains as they can agree. But there are other\r\nmarket towns which hold of divers lords of the kingdom wherein are both\r\nnatives and rustics of ancient time, who pay to their lords corporal\r\nservice of divers kinds, with other services which are not used among\r\nus, and who may be expelled out of those towns by their lords, and may\r\nnot inhabit in them or be restored to their former state, but by the\r\ncommon law of England.[427] And chiefly those and others that hold by\r\nsuch foreign services in such towns are not of our condition; neither\r\nshall they have our laws and customs but by way of purchase, to be\r\nperformed to our Capital Bailiff as they can agree between them, at the\r\npleasure and to the benefit of the city aforesaid.”[428]\r\n\r\nI. Singular advantages, indeed, fell to the lot of towns thus happily\r\nsituated on the national estate. The King was a Lord of the Manor too\r\nremote to have opportunity for overmuch meddling, and too greatly\r\noccupied with affairs of state to concern himself with the details\r\nof government in his numerous boroughs.[429] County magnates might\r\ncling passionately to the right of holding local courts as sources\r\nof power, and yet more important sources of wealth; but such rights\r\nwere of small consequence to a powerful sovereign, who as supreme head\r\nof the law could call up criminals to his own judgement seat from\r\nevery court in the country.[430] Confidence of supremacy made him\r\ncareless to put it to the test by abrupt assertions of authority, as\r\nprivate owners, apprehensive and uncertain, might be tempted to do;\r\nand in his indifference to small uses of power and devices for paltry\r\ngain, he held loosely to rights that brought much trouble and little\r\nprofit.[431] So long as his yearly ferm was punctually paid,[432] he\r\nwas ready to grant to the townsfolk leave to gather into their own\r\ntreasury the petty sums collected at the borough or manor courts,[433]\r\nor to make their mayor the king’s escheator; and while he thus won\r\ntheir gratitude and friendship he lost nothing by his generosity. In\r\nsurrendering local claims for a fixed payment, he not only relieved\r\nhimself of the charge of salaries to a multitude of minor officials,\r\nbut he had no longer to suffer from the loss of fines and dues and\r\nforfeitures which were nominally levied for the King, but which had\r\na constant tendency to find their way into the pockets of the town\r\nofficers or the tax-collectors rather than into his exchequer. In many\r\ncases, moreover, he may have gained considerably by the price which he\r\ndemanded for his favours; and the royal accounts possibly give a very\r\ninadequate record of the number of special gifts of money and yearly\r\nannuities paid by boroughs to the King in return for liberties granted\r\nto them.[434]\r\n\r\nII. As lord of the manor, therefore, the King was a liberal master,\r\nalways ready to arrange a compromise with his tenants as to vexatious\r\nfeudal claims. But he was equally ready to listen to their prayers for\r\nfreedom from the control of officers of the Shire and the Hundred.\r\nSo long as it was to the benefit of the central authority to break\r\nup and weaken provincial governments, to curtail the powers of the\r\nsheriff, to confound ambitious designs of local magnates, and shatter\r\npretensions on the part of the nobles which might tend to strengthen\r\nhereditary enemies of the crown, so long the townspeople might count on\r\nthe sovereign’s support in the struggle for independence. In questions\r\ntherefore that arose as to rival jurisdictions, in claims put forward\r\nby a borough against neighbouring lords for rights of navigation\r\nor pasturage or fishing, in all disputes which were carried in the\r\nlast resort to the arbitration of the king, his sympathy, especially\r\nif a fitting “courtesy” was offered by the burghers, was with his\r\nborough.[435] Powers won from local governments or from feudal lords\r\nwere divided between the King and the municipality; and under shelter\r\nof the royal authority large rights of local self-government were\r\nrapidly gathered into the burghers’ hands. Functions once exercised\r\nby the bailiff of the hundred and the sheriff of the county were\r\nhanded over to the mayor; he collected the fee-ferm, held the view of\r\nfrankpledge, levied taxes,[436] mustered the men-at-arms, and presided\r\nover civil and criminal courts.\r\n\r\nIII. Nor was there any serious difficulty as to the exercise of\r\nthe sovereign rights of the crown. To the King it mattered little\r\nwhether he sent a special deputy direct from the court, or whether he\r\ndelegated powers to the mayor, and used him as an official immediately\r\nresponsible to the crown; while on the other hand such a change meant\r\nmuch present solace to the townsfolk. A compromise was therefore\r\neasily brought about between the monarch and the people. The mayor was\r\ninvariably appointed as the King’s Clerk of the Market, the Measurer\r\nand Gauger at the King’s Standard, the Manager of the King’s Assize;\r\nhe became the representative of the sovereign in the most important\r\ncharges of administration, as one of the King’s Justices[437] in the\r\ntown, as Admiral,[438] as Mayor of the Staple. Administrative changes\r\nsuch as these left the power of the sovereign untouched and cost him\r\nnothing; while on the other hand the central government was by this\r\nmeans provided with a ready-made staff of trained officials,—a staff\r\nwhich the King could not possibly have created,[439] nor paid out of\r\nhis empty exchequer even if he had been able to create it—but which\r\nhad become absolutely essential for carrying out the supervision\r\nof local affairs at a time when such supervision was growing more\r\nimportant every day, from the point of view both of the King and\r\nof the people. The towns on their side, relieved by the new system\r\nfrom miseries[440] under which they had suffered, readily forgot\r\ndistinctions between laws made by them and made for them, so long as\r\nthese were administered by officers of whom they were allowed the\r\nelection and control.[441]\r\n\r\nIV. Finally if the towns suffered from the officers of the royal\r\nhousehold, a remedy was easily granted them. The sovereign found no\r\npersonal inconvenience in transferring the duties of these officers\r\nto the governors of the boroughs themselves; and the mayor or bailiff\r\nbecame the King’s Steward, and Marshal of the King’s Household in the\r\nborough. In short, as the towns advanced to independence, all manner\r\nof powers and responsibilities were heaped together on their chief\r\nofficer, with no clear discrimination between his various and oddly\r\nmingled functions. Men did not pause to ask which of his masters the\r\nmayor at any given moment was serving, whether he was acting as head of\r\nthe city government to carry out the burghers’ will, or as the officer\r\nappointed by the sovereign to execute his laws;[442] and nice questions\r\nas to the exact division of authority which had really taken place were\r\nso manifestly irrelevant in presence of the harmonious concentration\r\nof all power in a single hand, that jealousies and suspicions on both\r\nsides were allayed, to the great furtherance of peace and concord. To\r\nthe mediæval poet who drew a picture of Love as “the leader of our\r\nLord’s folk in Heaven,” standing as a “mean” or mediator of peace,\r\nthere was one obvious comparison—even “as the mayor is between the\r\nKing and the commons.”[443]\r\n\r\nThe history of the royal boroughs, therefore, so far as their relations\r\nwith the King are concerned, reduces itself into a long list of favours\r\nasked and given. Frequent troubles of state no doubt stimulated the\r\ngenerosity of sovereigns; and times of political disturbance and\r\nrevolution proved occasions when the towns rose into independence\r\nthrough the necessities of kings, who confirmed old franchises and\r\ngranted new ones, and “right largely made charters thereof, to the\r\nintent to have the more good-will and love in their land.”[444]\r\nThe civil wars under Henry the Second,[445] the money difficulties\r\nof Richard and John, the troubled minority of Henry the Third, the\r\ndisorders under Edward the Second, the commercial policy of Edward the\r\nThird, the political insecurity of Henry the Fourth after his seizure\r\nof the throne, the financial needs of Henry the Fifth, the tumults\r\nand fears of the reign of Henry the Sixth, the anxiety of Edward the\r\nFourth to conciliate the kingdom,—all these were so many heaven-sent\r\nopportunities for the burghers to win new instalments of local liberty;\r\nwhile the two periods of reaction brought about by the fear of the\r\nPeasant Revolt under Richard the Second, and the nervous apprehensions\r\nof Richard the Third, were themselves made use of by the governing\r\nclass in the boroughs to confirm and tighten their authority. So\r\nmonotonous indeed is the record of the burghers on the royal demesne,\r\nall moving together along the same well-beaten road to independence,\r\nwinning the same privileges, even winning them at the same time,[446]\r\nthat a brief statement of liberties secured by any single city will\r\nserve to illustrate the general history of all.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Henry the Second Norwich enjoyed certain liberties\r\nand privileges, but its citizens were practically feudal servants of\r\nthe King, who appointed their governors, took the profits of their\r\ncourts, and looked on the city as a private possession of his own.\r\nTheir true freedom began with the charter granted them in 1194 by\r\nRichard the First.[447] They were to have the customs of London;\r\nthe burgesses might not be summoned to answer any plea outside the\r\ncity; they were henceforth to elect their own Provost, “such as may\r\nbe fitting to us and to them;” and they were allowed to hold their\r\ncity at a ferm rent of £108 a year, which they themselves, instead\r\nof the sheriff, should collect and pay to the Exchequer. For the\r\nconfirmation of their rights, “and for having the city in their hand,”\r\nthe Norwich people paid 200 marks.[448] From this time the provost\r\ntook the place of the officer formerly appointed by the King, presided\r\nover the Borough Court in the Tolbooth and possibly held the view of\r\nfrankpledge, and paid the fines of the courts into the city treasury.\r\nThe sheriff of the county, however, still held a higher court, the\r\n_Curia Comitatus_, within the enclosure of the castle, where he\r\nexercised criminal jurisdiction, and jurors made the presentments\r\nordered by the assize of Clarendon.[449]\r\n\r\nBut this power of the sheriff only lingered on for a few years. In 1223\r\na new arrangement was made between the citizens and Henry the Third.\r\nNorwich consisted of four distinct divisions which had been naturally\r\nformed out of the four hamlets created by the first settlers and\r\nwhich had by degrees become united into a single town:—_Conesford_,\r\nwhere the earliest comers gathered round the ford over the river,\r\nprotected by the stream on one side, and on the other by the mound\r\non which the castle stood in later days; the _Westwick_, whose name\r\nshews its later foundation, and which lay on the further side of the\r\nfortifications, within the bend of the river; the _Magna Crofta_ or\r\nbig field of the castle, lying below the entrenchments midway between\r\nConesford and Westwick, which was made at the Conquest into a new ward,\r\nMancroft Ward; and the _Ward-over-the-Water_ on the further bank of\r\nthe river, somewhat cut off from the rest of the town.[450] For the\r\ngovernment of these “leets,” as the divisions came to be called, it was\r\ndecided in 1223 that the burghers should elect four bailiffs, one for\r\neach district.[451] There was no longer to be any provost, since the\r\nbailiffs were to take his place in joint government of the town, and\r\nwere further to take over the criminal jurisdiction hitherto exercised\r\nby the sheriff in his court at the castle. From this time therefore\r\nmost of the social, commercial, and criminal affairs of the city lay in\r\nthe burghers’ own hands.\r\n\r\nThe four bailiffs, however, had still no control over the castle and\r\nits entrenchments, nor over a wide reach of land that lay along the\r\nriver, stretching past Conesford and Mancroft and Westwick—land\r\nowned by the prior and convent; nor had they any authority over\r\nthe cathedral, the priory, and the bishop’s palace that lay within\r\nWestwick, nor over property owned by them or by other ecclesiastical\r\nbodies which penetrated into the heart of the city; while on the other\r\nhand tenants of castle and prior and bishop were all making their\r\nprofit out of the city trade, and enjoying its peace and protection.\r\nTherefore the next claim of the burghers necessarily was that the\r\nKing should give to the municipality authority to tax for the common\r\nexpenses all inhabitants alike, under whatever lord they held; and in\r\n1229 they obtained a royal grant that all “who should partake of the\r\nliberties which we have granted to the said citizens of Norwich ...\r\nshall be taxed and give aid as the said citizens;” and that “if anyone\r\nhas withdrawn from their customs and scots, he shall return to their\r\nsociety and custom, and follow their scot, so that no one shall be quit\r\ntherefrom.”[452] There was no trifling with the municipal authority\r\nin this matter; in 1236 and 1237 when the tenants of castle and prior\r\nattempted to resist the claim on their moneys, the sheriff was ordered\r\nto summon them before him to show by what right or warrant they claimed\r\nacquittance from payments to the city treasury; and again in 1276, when\r\nthe tenants of the castle refused to pay their share of taxes, the case\r\nwas brought before the barons of the exchequer, and an order came from\r\nWestminster that the sheriff was forthwith to levy the sum due and hand\r\nit over to the city.[453]\r\n\r\nHenry the Third granted many other favours “to our beloved citizens\r\nof Norwich,” feeling perhaps the advantage of their friendship amid\r\nthe increasing troubles of his reign; and the burghers of Norwich\r\ncertainly, like those of Winchester, took sides with him in the war\r\nagainst Simon de Montfort.[454] In 1253 they had been allowed to\r\nenclose their city with a ditch.[455] In 1255 (twenty years before\r\na general law was passed to this effect for all Englishmen), they\r\nwere freed from arrest for debt of which they were not sureties or\r\nprincipal debtors. And in 1256 Henry granted a charter which ordered\r\nthat the “citizens shall answer at our exchequer by their own hands\r\nfor all debts and demands ... and that no sheriff or other bailiff\r\nof ours shall henceforth enter the city aforesaid to make distresses\r\nfor any debts;” which decreed further that all merchants who shared\r\nin the Norwich liberties and merchandises were to pay the city taxes\r\n“wheresoever they shall make their residences;” and which ordained\r\nlastly that “no guild shall henceforth be held in the aforesaid city to\r\nthe injury of the said city.”[456] The sheriff was thus finally shut\r\nout from all land or houses held by the citizens; and absent merchants\r\nwere subjected to their lot and scot.\r\n\r\nFrom Edward the First the citizens in 1305 obtained the right to hold\r\nthe Leet of Newgate in Norwich, which the King had “lately recovered\r\nagainst the Prior of Holy Trinity”; and further paid a fine down,\r\nand promised to pay £10 yearly into the Exchequer for ever, for\r\na charter granting that they should not be impleaded outside the\r\ncity; that they should not be convicted by any foreigners but only\r\nby their co-citizens, save in matters touching the King or the whole\r\ncommonalty; that the bailiffs should have power to assess tallages and\r\nother reasonable aids “by the assent of the whole of the commonalty,\r\nor of the greater part of the same” for the protection and advantage\r\nof the city, and to make “reasonable distresses” for the levying of\r\nthese tallages as was done in other cities; and that they should hold\r\nthe Leet of Newgate which the Crown had “lately recovered against the\r\nPrior of Holy Trinity.”[457] Further the burghers remembered a trouble\r\ninto which they had fallen in the case of a thief who had stolen some\r\ncloth and brought much sorrow on the city; for having fled to the\r\nchurch of St. George he finally escaped out of it though the door was\r\nguarded by four parishes, who were all fined for their lax vigilance;\r\nthen being caught and condemned by the bailiffs and commonalty he was\r\ncondemned to be hung, but at his burial found to be still alive, and\r\nthe man who had cut him down was thrown into prison; and lastly the\r\nbailiffs were accused of illegal action in hanging him “without any\r\nman’s suit and without capture in the act,” and of “taking up thieves\r\nand malefactors for trespasses done outside the city and executing\r\njudgement on them in the city,” and the city liberties had been seized\r\ninto the King’s hands, and a royal officer set to rule over them.[458]\r\nSo the burghers in 1307 presented a petition that the right of infang\r\ntheof and outfang theof, which they had used at all times “whereof\r\nmemory runneth not,” might now be definitely inserted in their charter.\r\nFurther, since the sheriff “by malice” still found means on one excuse\r\nor another to arrest a citizen from time to time—and this though the\r\nNorwich people had the return of all manner of writs[459] so that\r\nneither the sheriff nor any foreign bailiff had any right to meddle\r\nwith them—they required of the King that at their demand every citizen\r\nthus seized should be delivered over to them out of the hands of the\r\nalien. Likewise they prayed that so long as a burgher lived in the\r\ncity he should never be required to attend any foreign court whatever\r\nby reason of any foreign tenure he might hold; and that no foreign\r\ntenement should give the right to sheriffs or foreign bailiff to\r\nsummon him to be in juries or inquests outside the city. Lastly, as a\r\nprotection against any danger of forfeiting their franchise by failure\r\nto pay the ferm rent, they asked permission for the corporation to hold\r\nin perpetual possession certain lands and houses the profits of which\r\nmight be set apart for the rent.[460]\r\n\r\nUnder Edward the Third the sheriff of the county was deprived of his\r\nlast plea for interference within the city walls. Up to this time he\r\nhad still collected rents and taxes and done justice for the tenants\r\nof the Castle Fee; and the ditches of the Castle and the Fee, thus\r\nfreed from city rule, had been made a sort of refuge for felons and\r\nmalefactors flying from the jurisdiction of the city officers. All\r\nthis, however, was in 1346 handed over to the bailiffs, and the sheriff\r\nwas in no wise to interfere.[461] Moreover, in consideration of the\r\ncost to which the citizens had gone in enclosing the city, they were\r\nset free for ever from the jurisdiction of the clerk of the market of\r\nthe King’s household.[462] Norwich was further given its own Admiral,\r\nwho sailed about in the “admiral’s barge,” and who held admiralty\r\ncourts and administered its law.[463] In 1331 it became a Staple town,\r\nand its mayor was made a mayor of the Staple, with a salary of £20 and\r\na seal given by the king.[464]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Norwich people had been gradually perfecting their own\r\ninternal system of government—a system which will be described in a\r\nlater chapter—and in the difficulties of Henry the Fourth they found\r\nopportunity to complete their work. A sum of £1,000 given to the King,\r\nbesides heavy fines paid in bribes on all sides, secured in 1403 a\r\ncharter which finally guaranteed to them the constitution of their\r\nchoice.[465] Norwich was made into a county of itself. A mayor was\r\nappointed, who was given supreme rights of jurisship.” in the city,\r\nand received from the King himself a sword which was to be carried\r\nbefore him with the point erect, along with the gold or silver maces\r\nborne by the serjeants-at-mace. The four bailiffs were replaced by two\r\nsheriffs, also elected by the burgesses, who were charged with matters\r\nconcerning the interests of the crown which had formerly been the\r\nbusiness of the bailiffs, and were responsible for the yearly rent of\r\nthe city. The mayor was appointed the King’s escheator, and thus the\r\nlast office which had been reserved in alien hands was given over to\r\nthe municipality. Finally in token of the consummation of the municipal\r\nhopes the old seal of the bailiffs was abolished to make way for a new\r\ncity seal.\r\n\r\nNorwich was but one among a number of boroughs whose inhabitants\r\nquietly and steadily gathered to themselves the liberties that made\r\nthem free, for in the fellowship of towns holding of the King under a\r\nuniform tenure throughout the “ancient demesne,” the list of privileges\r\ngranted to any one became the model for its neighbours near and\r\nfar.[466] With orderly progression, unbroken by any of the violent and\r\ndramatic incidents that indicate a time of conflict, all the bigger\r\ntowns won by gradual instalments complete local independence. Such\r\nchanges of method as we observe are simply changes made necessary by\r\nnew national legislation, such as the form of incorporation required\r\nafter the Statute of Mortmain,[467] or the right to elect Justices\r\nof the Peace when one power after another had been given to these\r\nofficers by law.[468] We do not distinguish seasons of plentiful\r\nharvest and periods barren of all growth; in one century as in another\r\nKings stooped to accept the “courtesies” offered, and granted the\r\nfavours solicited. Nor do we find records of advantages hastily given\r\nand timidly withdrawn; or, until the reign of Richard the Third,[469]\r\nis there any suggestion of anxiety on the part of Kings to check or\r\nlimit the free action of the boroughs.[470] Up to that time rulers of\r\nthe state seem to have had no apprehension of peril to public order,\r\nof jeopardy to trading interests, of injury to the administration of\r\njustice, of possible usurpations by the municipalities which might\r\nbring them into collision with the ordered forces of the world; and for\r\nthree hundred years statesmen freely allowed the growth of municipal\r\nambition, and gave full scope for the developement of all the various\r\nsystems of local self-government. The full importance of these facts\r\nonly becomes clear when we turn to the history of the towns that were\r\nunder subjection to other lords than the nation itself; and compare\r\nthe peaceful negotiations by which matters were arranged between the\r\nroyal boroughs and the State, with the violence of feeling aroused\r\nwhen the misgivings and alarms of private owners were brought into the\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nBATTLE FOR FREEDOM\r\n\r\n(2) _Towns on Feudal Estates_\r\n\r\n\r\nON the King’s lands, as we have seen, the interests of the monarch\r\nnever came into collision with the interests of his burghers, and\r\nthe townsfolk found an easy way to liberty. From time to time\r\nthey presented a petition for freedom, brought their gifts to win\r\nthe sovereign’s favour, and joyfully carried back to their fellow\r\ncitizens a new charter of municipal privileges. But the condition of\r\nthe towns that belonged to noble or baron was doubly depressed from\r\nthe standpoint of their happier neighbours. Of secondary importance\r\nalike in numbers, in wealth, or in influence, as compared to those\r\non royal demesne, they for the most part never emerged into any real\r\nconsequence; while their lord had every reason to oppose the growth\r\nof independence in his boroughs, and lacked nothing for its complete\r\nsuppression but the requisite power. New franchises were extorted\r\nfrom his weakness rather than won from his good will, and where\r\nacquiescence in the town’s liberties was not irresistibly forced on him\r\nhis opposition was dogged and persevering.\r\n\r\nThe dispute was none the less intense because under the conditions of\r\nEnglish life the controversy between the town and the feudal lord was\r\nlimited within a very narrow field; for the burghers saw well how the\r\nlord’s claims to supremacy might permanently fetter an active community\r\nof traders, and on this point townspeople fought with a pertinacity\r\ndetermined by the conviction that all their hopes of prosperity\r\ndepended on victory. To manufacturers and merchants the rule of an\r\nalien governor was fatal; trade died away before vexatious checks and\r\narbitrary imposts, and enterprising burghers hastened to forsake the\r\ntown where prosperity was stunted and liberty uncertain, and take up\r\ncitizenship in a more thriving borough. Success and emancipation went\r\nhand in hand; for the effects of a maimed and imperfect freedom were\r\nalways disastrous and far-reaching, and there is not a single instance\r\nof an English town which remained in a state of dependence and which\r\nwas at the same time prosperous in trade.\r\n\r\nOne or two instances will be enough to show the extent and character\r\nof the traders’ claim for “liberties.” The burghers of Totnes, who\r\nhad been fined for having a Guild by Henry the Second, had no sooner\r\nsucceeded in securing its authorisation from John than they at once\r\nmade it a weapon of offence, and a formidable weapon too with its roll\r\nof more than three hundred members, against their lord’s control of\r\nthe town market and of the shopkeepers. The Guild claimed the right to\r\nadmit non-residents to their company, so that these might freely trade\r\nwithout paying any tribute to the lord for one year, after that giving\r\nsix pence annually; and pretended to have authority to test weights and\r\nmeasures without orders from the lord’s bailiff; to hold the assize of\r\nbread and ale and receive fines; and apparently to deal out justice for\r\npetty offences. These usurpations of his rights were discussed between\r\nthe lord and his tenants with riots and contentions, in which the lord\r\nproved victorious in 1304, forcing the burghers to submit on every\r\npoint in which the Guild tried to bring in customs which lay beyond\r\nthe ancient rights of the community. They were forbidden to admit to\r\nthe Guild anyone who had not a house in the town, and non-residents\r\nhad to take oaths before his bailiff to pay a yearly fine to the lord.\r\nNo trial of weights and measures could take place till orders had been\r\nissued to the Seneschal of the Guild by the lord’s bailiff; when the\r\ntrial came on bailiff and town provost sat beside him in the Guildhall\r\nto hear the charges, and even then all false or suspected measures were\r\nto be kept by the provost till the lord’s next court. On the other hand\r\nthe bailiff might hold a trial of measures whenever he judged that he\r\ncould do the business better. So also the assize of bread was given to\r\nthe lord’s bailiff sitting with the provost of the town; all suspected\r\nbread and weights were to be seized by him, the offenders to be fined\r\nin the lord’s court, all punishments by tumbril or pillory inflicted by\r\nhis orders, and all proceeds of fines given over to him. Lastly when\r\nsmall thefts and riots were to be judged the bailiff sat by the town\r\nofficers and as many burgesses as chose to come, and took his share in\r\nthe proceedings—though occasionally in his absence the town officers\r\nmight act by common consent of the community.[471]\r\n\r\nSuch was the comparative helplessness of a community which, with all\r\nits tenacity of purpose, could neither urge custom nor tradition on its\r\nside in pleading for independent rights. In the borough of Barnstaple,\r\non the other hand, which had been granted by the King[472] to Sir John\r\nCornwall and his wife the Countess of Huntingdon, we have an instance\r\nof the immense advantages possessed by a town which though now in\r\nprivate ownership, inherited the tradition of privilege which its\r\npeople had won as tenants of ancient demesne.[473] In 1423 the Mayor,\r\nAldermen, and capital burgesses drew up a list of byelaws for the good\r\ngovernment of the borough, which apparently stirred the apprehensions\r\nof its lords. For a few years later, reviving ancient traditions\r\nof feudal authority in a suit against the borough, they complained\r\nthat the mayor and burgesses had of their own authority admitted as\r\n“Burgesses of the Wynde” “foreign” merchants and victuallers who merely\r\nvisited the town; and had turned to their own use the fines from\r\ndenizens pertaining to their lord; that they had taken the correction\r\nof bread and ale, and unlawfully seized fines and tolls; that they\r\nwould not suffer his officers to take custom after ancient usage from\r\nthe people of Wales for their merchandise; and that they even seized\r\nfines belonging to him for heaps of rubbish in the streets. Moreover\r\nthey did not render the suit and service due to the lord’s court\r\nfrom all the inhabitants of the borough, for without his leave they\r\nthemselves held a court every Monday, and instead of coming to every\r\ncourt of the lord’s steward they did not come oftener than twice a\r\nyear; nor would they suffer the lord’s officers to make attachments in\r\nthe borough at the Nativity of Our Mother after the ancient custom. In\r\nother words the townsfolk, just like the people of Totnes two hundred\r\nyears before, were bent on regulating their trade and spending the\r\nmoney collected in their courts and markets; but they were happier\r\nthan they of Totnes in being able to claim that all these so-called\r\nusurpations were ancient rights of the burgesses, by virtue, as they\r\nsaid, of a charter granted by King Athelstan 500 years before. As this\r\ncharter however had unluckily been “casualiter amissa,” the town had to\r\nfall back on the verdict of an inquisition held about 1300 as to the\r\nusages and franchises to which it was entitled, and the payments which\r\nwere due by the mayor and commonalty in place of old feudal services.\r\nHere the Barnstaple men held their own successfully, and in 1445 they\r\nsecured a charter from Henry the Sixth, “for accommodation of the\r\nburgesses in doing their business quietly,” which confirmed to them the\r\nfullest rights of self-government.[474]\r\n\r\nThe struggle of the boroughs with their feudal lords was however a\r\nmatter of little significance in England, where since the Conquest\r\nfeudalism from the point of view of the noble had so unsatisfactory a\r\nrecord. Fallen from the high estate of his brethren on the Continent,\r\ndespoiled of his might by one strong king after another, he saw\r\nhimself condemned to play in England a comparatively modest part, and\r\nfrom his less exalted plane was even constrained to assume in his\r\nrelations to burghers and traders a conciliatory, almost at times a\r\ndeprecating tone, not because he was lacking in “a high and pompous\r\nmind,” but simply because his fortunes had sunk low. Hence the conflict\r\nin England was of a very different character from the conflict abroad.\r\nFashions of careful ceremonial indeed long preserved the traditional\r\nsense of impassable barriers set between the dignity of the great\r\nwhose daily needs were supplied by the labour of others, and the low\r\nestate of those who had to depend upon their own toil. “Whensoever\r\nany nobleman or peer of the realm passed through any parish, all the\r\nbells were accustomed to be rung in honour of his person, and to give\r\nnotice of the passage of such eminency; and when their letters were\r\nupon any occasion read in any assemblies, the commons present would\r\nmove their bonnets in token of reverence to their names and persons.”\r\nBurghers and journeymen with an irreverent laugh at men “evermore\r\nstrutting who no store keep,”[475] gathered to see the noble go by “in\r\nhis robe of scarlet twelve yards wide, with pendent sleeves down on\r\nthe ground, and the furrur therein set amounting unto £20 or better,”\r\nwhile a train of followers crowded after him anxiously holding up with\r\nboth hands out of the filth of the mediæval streets the wide sleeves\r\nmade to “slide on earth” by their sides, and eagerly watching lest\r\nthe ladies should forget to admire “the plaits behind;” and the busy\r\nmockers of the market-place guessed that tailors and skinners must\r\nsoon carry their cloths and skins out into the fields if they would\r\nfind space enough to cut out robes like these.[476] But the fine\r\ngarments and leisurely state of the great folk, the hollow ornaments\r\nof a vanquished feudalism, were matters of little significance; the\r\nforces of the future lay rather with the crowd of workers to right\r\nand left—with the men who watched the brave procession sweep by, and\r\nthen gathered in their Common House to decree that any burgher who put\r\non the livery of a lord, or accepted his maintenance and protection,\r\nshould be blotted out of the book of burgesses, and driven from their\r\nmarket-place and assembly hall, and “that he come not among them in\r\ntheir congregations.”[477]\r\n\r\nFor the moment, indeed, the noble class was as it were thrown aside\r\nby the strong current of the national life, nor could the handful of\r\nfamilies that held half the soil of England and the lesser baronage\r\nwho followed in their train be recovered of their impotence, of their\r\nimpoverishment of intellect and decay of force, even by the greatest\r\nlandholder and the most typical member of their body, Warwick the\r\nKingmaker. Sated with possessions, forced into a position of leadership\r\nmainly by the imposing list of his great relations and the surprising\r\nnumber of his manors—a patriot who consecrated his services to the\r\ncause of a faction and the unrestrained domination of a family group of\r\nblood relations—a general who never got beyond an already antiquated\r\nsystem of warfare, devoid according to public rumour of personal\r\ncourage, deserted in a crisis by the one organised military force in\r\nthe public service—a commander with all the ready instincts of the\r\ncommon pirate—a statesman made after an old ancestral pattern, who\r\nhad learned his politics a couple of centuries before his time, and to\r\nthe last remained absolutely blind to the great movements of his own\r\nday—an administrator who never failed at a critical moment to put in\r\njeopardy the most important national interests—an agitator restless\r\nfor revolution, but whose influence in the national counsels was\r\npractically of no account when there was a pause in mere fighting—it\r\nis thus that Warwick stands before us, a consummate representative of\r\nhis demoralized class.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which the great landowners were living at this\r\ntime were indeed singularly unfavourable. With the new trade they had\r\ncomparatively little to do,[478] and the noble, with his throng of\r\ndependents and his show of state, was really living from hand to mouth\r\non the harvests from his fields and the plunder he got in war.[479]\r\nAfter the fashion of the time the treasure of the family was hoarded\r\nup in his great oak chests; splendid robes, cloth of gold, figured\r\nsatins, Eastern damasks and Sicilian silks, velvets and Flemish cloths,\r\ntapestries and fine linen, were heaped together with rich furs of\r\nmarten and beaver. Golden chains and collars of “the old fashion” and\r\n“the new,” rings and brooches adorned with precious stones, girdles of\r\ngold or silver gilt by famous foreign makers, were stored away in his\r\nstrong boxes, or in the safe rooms of monasteries, along with ewers\r\nand goblets and basins of gold and silver, pounced and embossed “with\r\ngreat large enamels” or covered with silver of “Paris touch.”[480] But\r\nthe owner of all this unproductive treasure scarcely knew where to turn\r\nfor a little ready money. The produce of the estate sufficed for the\r\nneeds of the household, and if the lord was called away on the king’s\r\nservice, or had to attend Parliament, a supply of oats was carried\r\nfor the horses “to save the expenses of his purse”; and an army of\r\nservants rode backwards and forwards continually to fetch provisions\r\nfrom fields and ponds and salting tubs at home, so that he should never\r\nbe driven to buy for money from the baker or at the market.[481] The\r\ncrowd of dependents who swelled his train, easily content to win an\r\nidle subsistence, a share of booty in time of war, “maintenance” in\r\nthe law courts, and protection from all enemies, either received no\r\npay at all, or accepted the most trifling sums—a few shillings a year\r\nwhen they could get it, with a “livery” supplied like their food from\r\nthe estate.[482] For money which was scarce everywhere was nowhere\r\nso scarce as in the houses of the landed proprietors, who amid their\r\nextravagant display found one thing always lacking—a few pounds to\r\npay an old debt or buy a new coat. Sir John Paston, the owner of broad\r\nestates in Norfolk, was forced more than once to pawn his “gown of\r\nvelvet and other gear” in London to get a few marks; when it occurred\r\nto him to raise money on his father’s funeral pall, he found his\r\nmother had been beforehand with him, and had already put it in pawn.\r\nDuring an unwonted visit to Westminster in 1449, the poor Lady of\r\nBerkeley wrote anxiously to her husband, one of the greatest landowners\r\nin England, “At the reverence of God send money, or else I must lay my\r\nhorse to pledge and come home on my feet”; and he managed to raise £15\r\nto meet her needs by pawning the mass book, chalices, and chasubles of\r\nhis chapel.[483] So also the Plumptons, in Yorkshire, were in perpetual\r\nmoney difficulties; servants were unpaid, bills not met, debts of £2\r\n10_s._ and £4 put off from term to term, and at last a friend who had\r\ngone surety for a debt of £100 to a London merchant was arrested.\r\n“Madam,” a poor tradesman writes to Lady Plumpton, “ye know well I have\r\nno living but my buying and selling, and, Madam, I pray you send me my\r\nmoney.” One of the family tried in vain to get a friend to buy him some\r\nblack velvet for a gown. “I pray you herein blame my non-power, but not\r\nmy will,” the friend answers from London, “for in faith I might not\r\ndo it but if I should run in papers of London, which I never did yet,\r\nso I have lived poorly thereafter.”[484] When times grew pressing the\r\ncountry families borrowed freely from their neighbours and relations;\r\nno one, even the sister of the Kingmaker, felt any hesitation in\r\npleading poverty as a reason for being off a bargain or asking for a\r\nloan;[485] and those who were in better case lent readily in the hope\r\nof finding a like help themselves in case of difficulty.[486] Year by\r\nyear debts accumulated, till the owner’s death allowed the creditors\r\nto open his coffers and scatter his treasured stores, when the “array,\r\nplate, and stuff of the household and of the chapel” scarcely sufficed\r\nto meet the legacies and bills, the charities deferred, and the masses\r\nrequired for his soul’s safety.[487]\r\n\r\nThere were indeed instances in which the growing poverty of the nobles\r\nopened an easy way for the emancipation of the towns, since it was\r\nsometimes possible, under the pressure of poverty or bankruptcy, to\r\nconvince the lord of a borough, even though he had but such a measure\r\nof good wit in his head\r\n\r\n “As thou shouldest mete of a mist from morn till even,”[488]\r\n\r\nthat the balance of profit lay on the side of freedom. For to some\r\nextent the difficulties of the landowners arose from the fact that\r\non their estates the commutation for feudal services, or dues to be\r\nrendered for the holding of land, had been settled in early times when\r\nmoney was scarce and demands for profit modest, and these charges\r\nremained fixed when prices were rising and when the need of ready money\r\nwas keenly felt.[489] But while the lord could look for no increase\r\nfrom his lands, a new source of profit had been opened to him in the\r\nboroughs on his estate. He could find money surely and easily by\r\nleasing out rights of trade, collection of tolls, and other privileges\r\nto the townspeople. In the middle of the thirteenth century the mayor\r\nand burgesses of Berkeley obtained from their lord freedom from all\r\nkinds of toll which he either demanded or might demand of them;[490]\r\nand in the fourteenth century he rented to them the tolls of the\r\nwharfage and of the market, and received larger profits from this\r\ntransaction than he gained from all the rent of the borough.[491]\r\n\r\nThe weakest corporation moreover had a persistence and continuity\r\nof life which gave it incalculable advantages in the conflict with\r\nindividuals subject to all the chances and changes of mortality.\r\nFor the nobles indeed the fight with the town was in many ways an\r\nunequal one. Driven hither and thither by urgent calls of war or of\r\nthe King’s business, the lord was scarcely ever at home to look to\r\nhis own affairs. In the frequent absences of the masters of Berkeley,\r\nperpetually called away by “troubles of state,” when the King summoned\r\nthem to his aid whether for civil war or war of conquest,[492] the\r\nneighbouring towns of Bristol and Gloucester found opportunity to\r\nescape from their control; and the march of the baron and his retainers\r\nfrom Berkeley was a subject of much greater gladness to the townsmen\r\nof Bristol than to the lord of the castle himself; for “the household\r\nand foreign accounts of this lord,” we are told, “reveal a marvellous\r\nunwillingness in him to this Scottish war, dispatching many letters and\r\nmessages to the King, and other lords and favourites about him, for\r\nexcuses.”[493] When, as a reward for his services, one of the Berkeleys\r\nwas given the custody and government of the town of Gloucester,[494]\r\nhe was also charged with the government of Berwick, and was moreover\r\ncalled away whenever the King found himself in military difficulties;\r\nso that the Gloucester burgesses cannot have had much to fear from\r\nhim. The care of the great estates, in fact, was constantly left to\r\nthe women of the house and to stewards, while the master, pressed\r\nby ambition, or quite as often by the driving necessity of getting\r\nmoney, was fighting in Wales or Scotland, or was looking for plunder\r\nin France, or for place at court. For three generations the lands of\r\nthe Pastons in Norfolk were managed by the capable wives of absentee\r\nlandlords—of the judge who must have spent most of his time in London\r\nor on circuit; of his son the sharp London lawyer; and of his grandson,\r\nSir John, the gay young soldier who hovered between London and Calais,\r\nand whose only care for his property was to press anxiously for its\r\nrents. The story of the Plumpton family was much the same. One of the\r\nPlumptons spent his last years and died in France; and no sooner did\r\nthe young Sir William reach his majority in 1426, than he also left his\r\nYorkshire estates and set off to join the French campaign.[495]\r\n\r\nOn the noble class too fell the heavy consequences of the rebellions\r\nand civil wars of which they were the main supporters. If the lord\r\ndied in battle his estates might pass to a minor; if he died on the\r\nscaffold they passed to the crown; or long imprisonment might thwart\r\nhis best laid plans for strengthening his hold over his boroughs. The\r\nyoung Lord Maurice of Berkeley, for instance, was drawn into rebellion\r\nagainst Edward the Second, and died in prison four and a half years\r\nlater. During the whole time that he held his estates he was only\r\nin freedom for four months; and his eldest son, who was imprisoned\r\nwith him, was not set at liberty till some months after his father’s\r\ndeath.[496] Meanwhile the towns were always quick to make their profit\r\nin such times of disturbance and revolution, as for example when the\r\nEarl of Devonshire was attainted by Edward the Fourth after the battle\r\nof Towton for his support of the Lancastrian cause, and the citizens of\r\nExeter seized so favourable an opportunity to claim the restitution of\r\na suburb stretching down to the riverside which the earls had held to\r\nstrengthen their hold on the navigation of the Exe.[497]\r\n\r\nNor was the lord’s position made more hopeful by the furious feuds\r\nbetween noble and noble which distracted the provinces in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and the incessant lawsuits by which the landowners sought to\r\nmend their fortunes. In 1463 James Lord of Berkeley made an agreement\r\nwith the Countess of Shrewsbury that they would have no more battles\r\nat law; for he was then sixty-nine, and she fifty-two, and neither\r\nof them since their ages of discretion had “enjoyed any three months\r\nof freedom from lawsuits.”[498] Nor did they wage their fight in the\r\nlaw-courts only, but carried on an open war by which Gloucestershire\r\nhad been distracted since 1421, and which proved one of the most deadly\r\nof the many provincial conflicts of the fifteenth century. Appeased at\r\nintervals to break out again with renewed force, and with the usual\r\nincidents of hangings and finings and imprisonments and ransomings, it\r\nfinally culminated in 1470 in a pitched battle on Nibley Green, where\r\nthe Berkeleys triumphantly maintained their cause at the head of about\r\n1,000 fighting men, and Lord Lisle, the son of Lady Shrewsbury, who\r\nled the enemy’s army, was killed. To country folk and traders this\r\nfeud of the nobles carried with it, we are told, “the ill-effects and\r\ndestructions of a petty war, wherein the borough town of Berkeley,\r\nfor her part, saw the burning and prostration of many of her ancient\r\nhouses, as her old rent which till that time was £22 by the year and\r\nupwards, and by those devastations brought down to £11 and under,\r\nwhere it sticketh to this day, without recovery of her ancient lustre\r\nor greatness.”[499] Such a strife was by no means singular or without\r\nparallel, and the histories of Norfolk, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, or\r\nLancashire have their records of similar outrages. Exeter was thrown\r\ninto alarm by a great fight on Clistheath in 1453 between the Earl\r\nof Devon and Lord William Bonvil where many persons were grievously\r\nwounded and much hurt done: “the occasion whereof was about a dog;\r\nbut great displeasure thereby came to the city, where presently after\r\nthe fight the Lord Bonvil sheltered himself, which the Earl took\r\namiss, thinking it had been so done by the city in some displeasure to\r\nhimself.”[500] The mere instinct of self-protection naturally drove\r\nthe towns to detach their interests from nobles whose alliance brought\r\ndisaster and ruin to simple traders, and in every borough statute\r\nafter statute forbidding the inhabitants to wear the “livery”[501] of\r\nany lord whatever, testified to the determination of the towns to cut\r\noff from the great people of the country round every possibility of\r\nstirring up faction within their borders.\r\n\r\nBut if boroughs in the ownership of a private lord might secure\r\nadvantages through his poverty, his misfortune, or his weakness, their\r\nposition was one of essential inferiority as compared with towns on\r\nthe public demesne.[502] In the story of Liverpool we have a curious\r\nillustration of the fortunes of a borough whose lot it was to fall at\r\none time into the charge of the state, and at another to be thrown into\r\nthe hands of a noble—and whose vicissitudes at last left it in a sort\r\nof indeterminate condition where it owed a deferential obedience to\r\npatrons or masters on every side.\r\n\r\nLiverpool, which had been granted by Henry the Second to the constable\r\nof Lancaster Castle, was resumed in 1207 by John, who granted it a\r\ncharter of trading privileges. A new charter of Henry the Third, in\r\n1229, gave it a guild merchant and hanse, with freedom from toll, and\r\nthe rights of a free borough; and on the very next day after this grant\r\nHenry gave the lease of the fee-farm to the burgesses for four years at\r\n£10 a year.[503] The true foundations of municipal independence were\r\nthus laid. The town had its common seal; one of its two bailiffs was\r\napparently elected by the people, and charged with the collecting of\r\ntolls for the ferm; and the busy trade with Ireland at that time, and\r\nthe later advantage of a secure place of embarkation for troops, which\r\nbecame very important as the harbour of Chester silted up, promised\r\nprosperity. In the same year, however, the town was granted away by the\r\nKing to the Earl of Chester, then passed in 1232 to the Earl of Derby;\r\nand in 1266 was given to Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, and\r\nunder the Lords of Lancaster Liverpool remained till a century later,\r\nwhen in 1361 it passed by marriage to John of Gaunt.\r\n\r\nAll hope of freedom for Liverpool died away under its new lords. The\r\ngrant of the ferm was not renewed for over a hundred years; and at an\r\nenquiry of “Quo Warranto” in 1292 under Edward the First “certain men\r\nof the Borough of Liverpool came for the commonalty, and say that they\r\nhave not at present a bailiff of themselves, but have been accustomed\r\nto have, until Edmund the King’s brother impeded them, and permits\r\nthem not to have a free borough.” Wherefore they claim only “that they\r\nmay be quit of common fines and amercements of the county, &c., and\r\nof toll, stallage, &c., through the whole kingdom,” for “as to the\r\nother liberties” which they used to have “the aforesaid Edmund now has\r\nthem.” They quote charters, to show that their ancient liberties had\r\nbeen held direct from the crown, and the court decided that “Edmund\r\nhath usurped and occupied the aforesaid liberties,” and ordered him to\r\nappear before it; but no action seems to have been taken against him,\r\nand for forty years he and his successors went on themselves collecting\r\nthe tolls.[504] At last in 1356 the lord Henry allowed the townsmen to\r\nelect a mayor every year, and the next year the first Duke of Lancaster\r\n(father-in-law of John of Gaunt) leased the ferm to the mayor and\r\nothers to hold for the burgesses for ten years,[505] and Liverpool\r\nwas thus restored to the same position in which the King had put it a\r\nhundred and thirty years earlier. But even now its limited privileges\r\nrested simply on the will and caprice of the lord; he might give the\r\nlease of the ferm with the right of collecting tolls for the rent to\r\nthe mayor, or an ex-mayor, or whomever he would; he might grant it for\r\na year, or for ten years, or he might take it all back into his own\r\nhands. As a matter of fact questions of convenience and profit seem\r\nto have made it advisable to leave the collections of taxes mainly\r\nwith the town officers. When John of Gaunt granted his lease, at the\r\nrequest of the “honest and discreet men of the burgesses” the articles\r\nwere embodied in a patent “to ourselves, to the mayor, and to the\r\nbailiffs,”[506] and in his time the lease was commonly granted for ten\r\nyears.[507]\r\n\r\nHowever some of the evils of such a system might be mitigated by the\r\nprudence of rulers bent on securing the utmost possible profits from\r\ntheir subjects, there was no real guarantee of freedom or security\r\nto the people. But when at the death of John of Gaunt in 1399, the\r\nDuchy of Lancaster was united to the crown, there was a new gleam of\r\nhope. The ferm of Liverpool, like that of Leicester, was now again\r\npaid to the King; an effort seems to have been made to abolish the old\r\nuncertain[508] system, and in 1421 Henry V. granted the fee-farm for\r\none year to the corporation, while an inquiry was held as to the value\r\nof the property and the terms of its tenure since the time of John of\r\nGaunt. The King’s death however stopped the proceedings, and the rising\r\nfortunes of the town were extinguished by the two great families who\r\nwere from this time definitely settled down on it.[509]\r\n\r\nFor Liverpool was now hemmed in between two rival fortresses. Sir\r\nJohn Stanley with an army of followers was encamped in a great square\r\nembattled fort, with subordinate towers and buildings forming three\r\nsides of a quadrangle, the whole planted on the river edge, and\r\ncommanding both the town and the Mersey, where the Stanleys’ ships\r\nwere moored, and whence they set sail for their new kingdom, the Isle\r\nof Man.[510] Sir Richard Molyneux, as hereditary Constable, held\r\nthe King’s castle a little further along the river, with its area of\r\nfifty square acres defended by four towers, and surrounded by a fosse\r\nthirty yards wide, much of which was cut in the solid rock.[511] When a\r\nquarrel broke out in 1424 between the lords of these rival fortresses,\r\nStanley collected a multitude of people in the town to the number of\r\n2,000 or more, for he declared that Sir Richard Molyneux “will come\r\nhither with great congregations, riots, and great multitude of people\r\nto slay and beat the said Thomas (Stanley), his men and his servants,\r\nthe which he would withstand if he might.” On the other hand Sir\r\nRichard had gathered his forces near the West Derby fen, “and there\r\non a mow within the said town we saw the said Sir Richard with great\r\ncongregations, rout and multitude to the number of 1,000 men and more,\r\narrayed in manner as to go to battle, and coming in fast towards\r\nLiverpool town.” A pitched battle was only prevented by the sheriff of\r\nthe county, who hastened to the rescue at the head of his forces, and\r\nsucceeded in seizing first Stanley in his tower, and then Molyneux as\r\nhe rode towards the town.[512]\r\n\r\nSuch scenes of riot and disorder were fatal to the prosperity and\r\nmunicipal hopes of Liverpool; but there was no escape from their\r\nunwelcome patrons. Both the great houses fought for York; and in\r\nreturn Edward the Fourth granted to Stanley the borough of Liverpool\r\nand other estates formerly belonging to the Duchy of Lancaster; while\r\nMolyneux was made chief forester of West Derby, steward of West Derby\r\nand Salford, and constable of Liverpool castle. Richard the Third again\r\ngave to the Stanleys large grants in Lancashire, and confirmed the\r\nMolyneux people in their offices,[513] and Henry the Seventh favoured\r\ntheir claims. The lords were great and important people in those days,\r\nand the little town of no account. Its independence died away, and\r\nthe troubles of the ferm revived in their old bad form. The question\r\nof the lease was never settled, but in any case it passed out of the\r\nhands of the corporation. From 1495 it was for many years granted to\r\nDavid ap Griffith, who when he became mayor in 1502 had it renewed\r\nto him. Henry the Eighth leased it in 1525 and 1529 to his widow and\r\nson-in-law for terms which were to expire in 1566. In 1537, however,\r\nit was let to Thomas Holcraft, who sublet it to Sir William Molyneux.\r\nThe mayor and corporation under Edward the Sixth declared the authority\r\nof the Molyneux family to be illegal, and claimed under the old lease\r\ngranted to Griffith. For many years they fought obstinately in the\r\ncase, holding perhaps that the house of their old mayor more nearly\r\nrepresented the town and its interests than the house of Molyneux; and\r\none of them was thrown into prison for his resistance under Mary.[514]\r\nThe ferm was not finally granted to the corporation till 1672; and\r\nLiverpool was for a couple of centuries so sorely tried by the\r\nnecessity of keeping well with the two great families that overawed it\r\nas well as with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,[515] whether\r\nin the collecting of its scanty taxes or the choosing of its burghers\r\nfor Parliament, that the history of its civic developement long\r\nremained of no importance.[516]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nBATTLE FOR FREEDOM\r\n\r\n(3) _Towns on Church Estates_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE towns on ecclesiastical estates form a distinct group, whose\r\nlot was materially different from boroughs on ancient demesne or on\r\nfeudal lands. All lay property was subject only to laws and customs\r\nwhich had been ultimately determined by the necessities of social or\r\npolitical expediency, and which, dealing with secular possessions\r\nfor secular purposes, were capable of being unmade as they had been\r\nmade. But the towns which were reckoned among ecclesiastical estates\r\nlay under the special conditions that governed those estates, where\r\nreligious and supernatural influences had been forced into the service\r\nof material wealth, and the attempt was made by spiritual authority\r\nto fix fluctuating political conditions into perpetual immutability.\r\nPrelates of the Church professed to rule with a double title, not only\r\nas feudal lords of the soil, but as guardians of the patrimony of S.\r\nPeter, holding property in trust for a great spiritual corporation,\r\nand exercising an authority maintained by formidable sanctions. If\r\nthe watchwords of property are always impressive, among lay folk they\r\nare still open, under sufficiently strong pressure, to reasonable\r\ndiscussion; and it is admitted that temporal rights may be plausibly\r\nexchanged for others more expedient, or may be fairly bartered away\r\nas a means of buying a continued and secure existence. The Church,\r\nhowever, by a fruitful confusion of the terms ecclesiastical and\r\nreligious, assumed to hold property by another tenure than any temporal\r\nowner; girt round about by tremendous safeguards to which the lay world\r\ncould not aspire, and leaning on supernatural support for deliverance\r\nfrom all perils, it could the better refuse to discuss bargains\r\nsuggested by mere political expediency.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of reconciling this assumption of permanent and\r\nindivisible supremacy with the actual facts of life became very\r\napparent with the passage of the centuries, when from a variety of\r\ncauses it was no longer possible for the clerical order to maintain the\r\nplace it had once held as the advanced guard of industry and learning,\r\nand its tendency was to sink into the position of a parasite class,\r\nproducing nothing itself, but clinging to the means of wealth developed\r\nby the labour of a subject people. With the wisdom born of experience\r\nthe Church was ready to give to its tenants all trading privileges, and\r\nany liberties that directly made for the accumulation of wealth;[517]\r\nbut the flow of its liberality was suddenly dried up when townspeople\r\nproposed to add political freedom to material gain, nor was it likely\r\nto be quickened again by the crude simplicity with which the common\r\nfolk resolved the question of the lordship of canons and monks.\r\n\r\n  “Unneth (scarcely) might they matins say,\r\n  For counting and court holding;”\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “Saint Benet made never none of them\r\n  To have lordship of man nor town.”[518]\r\n\r\nThe rising municipalities on the other hand, even if they had a history\r\nbut a century or two old, were endowed with all the young and vigorous\r\nforces of the modern world; nor is there a single instance of a town\r\nwhere a lively trade went hand in hand with a subservient spirit, or\r\nwhere a temper of unconquerable audacity in commercial enterprise\r\ndid not throw its exuberant force into the region of government and\r\npolitics. With all their abounding energy, however, burghers had still\r\nto discover that freedom might be won anywhere save at the hands of\r\nan ecclesiastical lord. If Norwich received from the bounty of Kings\r\none privilege after another in quick succession till its emancipation\r\nwas complete, its neighbour Lynn, equally wealthy and enterprising,\r\nbut subject to the Bishop of Norwich, was fighting in 1520 to secure\r\njust such control of its local courts as Norwich had won for the\r\nasking three hundred years before. The royal borough of Sandwich had\r\nbeen allowed to elect its mayor and govern itself for centuries, while\r\nRomney, also one of the Cinque Ports but one which happened to be owned\r\nby the Archbishop of Canterbury, did not gain the right to choose its\r\nown mayor till the time of Elizabeth, and was meanwhile ruled by any\r\none of the archbishop’s squires or servants whom he might send as\r\nits bailiff, and forced to adopt any expedient by which while under\r\nthe forms of bondage it might win the practice of freedom. A dozen\r\ngenerations of Nottingham burghers had been ordering their own market,\r\ntaking the rents of their butcheries and fish stalls and storage rooms,\r\nsupervising their wool traders and mercers, and admitting new burgesses\r\nto their company by common consent, while the men of Reading were still\r\ntrying in vain every means by which they might win like privileges from\r\nthe abbot who owned the town. Everywhere the same story is repeated,\r\nwith varying incidents of passion and violence. The struggle sometimes\r\nlasted through centuries: in other cases it was brought to an early\r\nclose. Some boroughs won a moderate success, while others wasted their\r\nlabour and their treasure for small reward. In one place ruin settles\r\ndown on the town, in another gleams of temporary success kindle new\r\nhopes, in a third the dogged fight goes on with monotonous persistence;\r\nbut everywhere anger and vengeance wait for the day of retaliation,\r\nwhen monastery and priory should be levelled to the ground.\r\n\r\nI. There was a distinct difference in the lot of towns under the\r\ncontrol of a bishop, and others which were subject to a convent.\r\nBurghers who owed allegiance to a bishop had to do with a master whose\r\nwealth, whose influence, whose political position, whose training, made\r\nhim a far more formidable opponent than any secular lord. On the other\r\nhand he probably lived at some distance from the borough, and, charged\r\nas he was with the administration of his bishopric and the estates of\r\nthe see, besides all the business of a great court official occupied\r\nin weighty matters of state, he had but limited attention to give to\r\nits affairs. As the see passed from hand to hand, a resolute fight with\r\nan over-ambitious borough which was begun by one bishop might die away\r\nunder the feebler rule, the indifference, or the wiser judgement of his\r\nsuccessor. In the case therefore of towns on episcopal estates, if the\r\nstruggle was arduous and costly, still its issue was not irrevocably\r\ndetermined beforehand, and the burghers might hope for at least partial\r\nvictory. But the emancipation of the townsmen was long deferred, and in\r\nthe fifteenth century there were boroughs where the bishop’s hand still\r\npressed heavily on the inhabitants.[519]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest trading towns in England gives such a record of\r\nceaseless contention carried on to win rights which had been peacefully\r\ngranted long before to every prosperous borough on the royal demesne.\r\nThe Bishop of Norwich had been lord of Lynn since its earliest\r\nhistory.[520] It is true that about 1100 A.D., one Bishop Herbert made\r\na grant of the Church of S. Margaret and the little borough that lay\r\naround it—between Millfleet and Purfleet—to the monks of Norwich. But\r\nthe land beyond these boundaries still belonged to the see. Lying as it\r\ndid at the mouth of the Ouse, and forming the only outlet for the trade\r\nof seven shires, Lynn was destined to be one of the great commercial\r\nports of the east coast, and the bishops proved good stewards of their\r\nproperty. As population outgrew the Lynn of older days, with its little\r\nmarket shut in between the Guildhall and S. Margaret’s where the booths\r\nthen as now leaned against the walls of the parish church, and its\r\ntangle of narrow lanes leading to the river side, houses began to reach\r\nout over the desolate swamp that stretched to the north along the river\r\nside. Under the energetic rule of the prelates the sea which ebbed and\r\nflowed over the marsh was driven back, and a great wall raised against\r\nit, 340 feet long and nine feet thick at the base; while another stone\r\nwall ran along the eastern side to protect the town from enemies who\r\nmight approach it by land. In the second half of the twelfth century\r\nthe “Bishop’s Lynn” rose on the newly won land along the river bank,\r\nwith its great market-place, its church, its Jewry, its merchant\r\nhouses; and soon in the thick of the busiest quarter by the wharves\r\nappeared the “stone house” of the bishop himself, looking closely out\r\non the “strangers’ ships” that made their way along the Ouse, laden\r\nwith provisions and merchandise.\r\n\r\nLynn was now in a fair way to become the Liverpool of mediæval times.\r\nUnder King John its prudent bishop obtained for the town charters\r\ngranting it all the liberties and privileges of a free borough, saving\r\nthe rights of its lords;[521] and then at once proceeded by a bargain\r\nwith the convent at Norwich to win back for the see the whole of\r\nthe lay property in the old borough, leaving to the monks only the\r\nchurches and spiritual rights. Once more sole master of the town,\r\nhis supremacy was only troubled by the lords of Castle Rising who,\r\nby virtue of a grant from William Rufus, claimed half the profits\r\nof the tolbooth and duties of the port, while the bishop had the\r\nother half. In 1240 however an exact agreement was drawn up between\r\nprelate and baron as to their respective rights; and the bailiffs of\r\nboth powers maintained a somewhat boisterous jurisdiction over the\r\nwaters of Lynn,[522] collected their share of dues paid by the town\r\ntraders on cargoes of herrings, or on the wood, skins, and wine they\r\nimported from foreign parts, and in their own way made distresses\r\nfor customs, plaints, and so forth. Thus Robert of Montault, in the\r\ntime of Edward the Second, set up a court under his own bailiff at\r\none of the bridges, and caused the merchants “rowing and flowing to\r\nthe said town of Lynn with their ships and boats, laden as well with\r\nmen as with merchandise,” to be summoned, distrained, and harassed,\r\n“both by menacing them with hurling of stones that they come to land\r\nand tarry, and by extorting heavy fines from them,” till at last in\r\ndespair the traders gave up their business, and sold all their ships\r\nand boats. And when the exasperated burghers in their turn set upon\r\nthese alien officers in 1317 and threw Robert himself into prison,[523]\r\nthis outbreak only brought upon them new calamities, for they were\r\ncondemned by the King’s judges to make atonement for their crime\r\nby paying to the offended lord within the next six or seven years\r\na fine of four thousand pounds; which was practically equal to the\r\nconfiscation of the whole of the municipal expenditure for about thirty\r\nyears. Soon after this, however, the rights of the lords of Rising were\r\nsold to the Queen Dowager Isabella and passed through her to Edward\r\nthe Third; so the rough and ready methods of their bailiffs came to an\r\nend.[524]\r\n\r\nThe power of the bishop on the other hand was still untouched. He held\r\nthe Hall Court through his steward; and held further the Court Leet and\r\nview of frankpledge; and owned the Tolbooth Court. There was indeed a\r\nmayor,[525] but his authority was small, for the bishop who had been\r\neager to grant his burghers the privileges of trade[526] was less\r\neager to see them set up any real self-government. Owing his post to\r\nthe bishop’s approval and nomination, if the mayor failed in obedience\r\nor respect his place might be at once forfeited. His power of levying\r\ntaxes was limited and subject to his lord’s control, nor could he make\r\ndistress for sums levied on the commonalty. He was not charged with the\r\ncustody or the defence of the town; it was the bishop who had command\r\nof the town gates, who could order them to be shut at his own will,\r\nand with a following of men-at-arms could enforce the order.[527] What\r\nwas far more important, the bishop on the plea of protecting the poor\r\nfrom tyranny had withdrawn from him the power of compelling inhabitants\r\nto take up the franchise, and by thus establishing in the borough a\r\npopulation dependent on himself had permanently divided its forces.[528]\r\n\r\nAs in other towns, however, so here the Guild Merchant proved itself a\r\nmost powerful organization for the winning of local independence.[529]\r\nLynn was already in the thirteenth century becoming one of the richest\r\ntowns in the country, and the mayor was supported by a Guild as\r\nmasterful and as wealthy as any in England. When once the question was\r\nraised whether he or the bishop was really to command within its gates,\r\ntwo equally matched and formidable forces were brought into play; and a\r\nwar of two hundred years was conducted on either side with violence and\r\ncraft, and remained of doubtful issue to the last. The bishop narrowly\r\nwatched every effort made by the mayor to enlarge his powers or exalt\r\nhis state; and the mayor was no less jealous of the pretensions of his\r\nlord. In the course of many experiments in the making of constitutions\r\nfor its government, Lynn was again and again torn with disputes, and\r\nharassed by the difficulties of rightly adjusting the powers of its\r\nvarious classes; and in every constitutional struggle the bishop\r\ninterfered anew, and often almost dictated the final settlement. The\r\nburghers treated him as occasion served. Constant gifts were offered to\r\nsoften his heart. A pipe of red wine, a vessel of Rhine wine, portions\r\nof oats with a sturgeon, pike and tenches, formed one of these peace\r\nofferings;[530] at another time it would be a costly gift of wax. But\r\nwhat they gave with one hand they were ready to take away with the\r\nother; and when chance happily favoured them appropriated without\r\nscruple a house, 100 acres of land and twenty acres of pasturage which\r\nthe bishop held in right of his church of Holy Trinity at Norwich.[531]\r\nAs disputes grew hot, now over one point, now over another, prelate\r\nand town alike called the king’s authority to their aid. If a sea-wall\r\nwas washed away by a high tide, the burghers would cry to the Privy\r\nCouncil to compel the bishop to rebuild it;[532] or they would demand\r\njustice against him on the plea that he had usurped their own officers’\r\nright to hold the Leet Court and the Tolbooth Court. The decision of\r\nthe crown was given sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other; or\r\nthe sovereign might for a time take the disputed authority into his own\r\nhands. But it was inevitable that the final gain should fall to the\r\nking, whose authority was strengthened by every appeal to his supreme\r\njurisdiction; while lesser profits came to the court by the way—gifts\r\nto high officials and great people, and to the royal judges when they\r\ncame to hold their assizes in the Guild Hall, and the town lavished its\r\ntreasures in costly dinners and varied wines and presents to them and\r\nto their clerks.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the fourteenth century we can trace the progress\r\nof the long strife as the town gradually perfected its municipal\r\norganization. First came the necessary financial precautions. In 1305\r\nthe Guild established itself more firmly by a charter which secured\r\nto it all its lands and tenements; and the mayor obtained power to\r\ndistrain for sums levied on the commonalty.[533] Then at an assembly\r\nheld in the Guildhall in 1314 authority was given to twenty-six persons\r\nto elect twelve of the more sufficient of the town to make provision\r\nfor all business touching the community in the King’s parliament and\r\nelsewhere.[534] But the real struggle seems to have begun about 1327\r\nwhen much money was spent on lawyers, negotiations with the bishop,\r\nand a new charter, and the business was still going on in 1330 with\r\nmore counsels’ fees and messengers to London. Finally in 1335 the town\r\nbought a new charter from the king at a cost of £55 and a multitude of\r\ngifts to king and queen and bishop.[535] In this year or the next it\r\nobtained, among other things, the right to have all wills that affected\r\nproperty in the town proved in the Guild Hall before the mayor and\r\nburgesses.[536] The bishop seems to have found means of defeating the\r\nburghers’ intention in this particular claim; but there still remained\r\nthe one important question which lay behind all minor struggles—that\r\nof the administration of justice in the town—the question whether it\r\nwas the mayor or an ecclesiastical officer who should preside in the\r\ncourts, and whether their profits, fines, and forfeitures should go\r\nto enrich the treasury of the bishop or of the municipality. The mayor\r\nheld a court in the Guild Hall twice a week, and had jurisdiction over\r\nall transgressions and debts arising by water between the limits of\r\nS. Edmondness and Staple Weyre,[537] and he seems now further to have\r\nlaid claim to the view of frankpledge and the criminal jurisdiction of\r\nthe Leet Court. The bishop answered with a vigorous retort. In 1347\r\nhe assumed the view of frankpledge of the men of Lynn and tenements\r\nformerly held by the corporation, and withdrew or threatened to\r\nwithdraw from the burghers the right of electing their mayor. On this\r\nan appeal was made to the king, who sent a royal commission to enquire\r\ninto the dispute, and meanwhile seized with his own hand the view of\r\nfrankpledge and the lands, giving the first over for the time to the\r\nsheriff of the county and the second to the king’s escheator.[538]\r\nPossibly there was some attempt at a compromise, but the new charter\r\nof 1343 in which the bishop confirmed the liberties granted by his\r\npredecessors,[539] even if it may have allowed the mayor’s election,\r\nleft the great question of the courts unsolved. The burghers still\r\ndebated whether the town officers were not entitled to hold the view of\r\nfrankpledge, and the husting court, and to have cognizance of pleas—in\r\nfact to exercise all the more important rights now monopolized by the\r\nbishop; and insisted on the election of their own mayor. It was in\r\nvain that Edward the Third ordered the mayor and community under pain\r\nof forfeiture of their liberties to alter their demeanour and not cause\r\nprejudice and damage to the bishop;[540] and the whole matter was at\r\nlast brought before the King’s Court in 1352, when the judges decided\r\nagainst the town in every question raised. In spite of the verdict,\r\nhowever, there was one point on which the people refused to submit; and\r\nthe bishop was compelled to confirm their right to elect yearly one of\r\nthemselves as mayor, though he enforced a significant confession of\r\nsubjection by requiring that the mayor should immediately after the\r\nelection appear before himself or his steward, and swear to maintain\r\nthe rights of the church of Norwich.[541]\r\n\r\nBut the burghers never yielded their consent to the decision of the\r\nKing’s justices, and at every provocation loudly renewed their protest.\r\nWhen the bishop visited Lynn in 1377, he demanded that in recognition\r\nof his supremacy the town serjeant should carry before him the wand\r\ntipped at both ends with black horn, which was usually borne before the\r\nmayor himself. For their part they were heartily willing, answered the\r\ncourteous mayor and aldermen, but they feared that at such a flagrant\r\nbreach of their ancient customs and liberties, the commons, “always\r\ninclinable to evil,” would certainly fall on the bishop’s party with\r\nstones and drive them out of the town. But the bishop roughly rebuked\r\nthe mayor and his brethren for “mecokes and dastards,” thus fearing\r\nthe vulgar sort of people, as if it mattered to him what the common\r\nfolk should say; and set out on his ride with the rod borne before\r\nhim. He rode alone with his followers, however, for no burghers would\r\naccompany him; and as he went the whole people rose, and with their\r\nbows and clubs and staves and stones broke up the brave procession,\r\nand put the bishop and his men to flight, carrying off many hurt and\r\nwounded.[542] It seems possible that the fray was really excited by the\r\nastute mayor and council as a means of making a final breach between\r\nthe bishop and the common people. But their opponent was too strong\r\nfor them. The bishop carried his complaint to the King’s Council, and\r\n“for the transgression done to him in the town” the burgesses barely\r\nescaped punishment by spending a sum equal perhaps to two years of the\r\ntown revenues in fines and gifts to the king, his mother, and others\r\nwho had “laboured for the community”; besides paying £116 10_s._ 0_d._\r\nfor the expenses of the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses, in going to\r\nLondon on the business.[543] Seventy years later, after a series of\r\nconstitutional troubles, the old quarrel as to rights of jurisdiction\r\nand the use of the symbols of supreme authority broke out anew. The\r\nmayor in 1447 got a grant from the King allowing a sword to be carried\r\nbefore him[544] with the point erect, the last and highest emblem\r\nof absolute jurisdiction. At this outrage to his dignity the bishop\r\ninterfered promptly and resolutely, and the next year the King had\r\nto write that in spite of his good inclinations he must remember his\r\ncoronation oath to observe the rights of the Church, and that the mayor\r\nmust henceforth cease from having any sword or mace borne before him.\r\nIn 1461, however, whether the town had got a new grant from Edward,\r\nor was taking advantage of troubled times to re-assert its claim, the\r\ncommon accounts register a payment of 4_d._ for the “cleaning of the\r\nmayor’s sword,” and 6_s._ 8_d._ for “crimson velvet for the sword\r\nand for making it up.”[545] And when in 1462 the bishop came to the\r\ntown with a following of sixty armed men, and ordered the gates to be\r\nshut after him, the attitude of the people was not to be mistaken,\r\n“the mayor and all the commonalty of Lynn keeping their silence” when\r\nthe bishop was openly defied in the streets by the lord of Oxenford\r\nwith his fellowship, even though “the bishop and his squires rebuked\r\nthe mayor of Lynn, and said he had shamed both him and his town for\r\never, with much other language.” So clear was the state of things to\r\nthe bishop’s sixty men-at-arms that “when we met there bode not with\r\nhim over twelve persons at the most with his serjeant-at-arms, _which\r\nserjeant was fain to lay down his mace_; and so at the same gates we\r\ncame in we went out, and no blood drawn, God be thanked.”[546]\r\n\r\nThe incident was not one to soften passions or conciliate rivals; but\r\nthe issue of the strife as compared with the hostilities in the last\r\ncentury shows how the balance of power was shifting. The bishop’s\r\nresources were being exhausted faster than his pretensions; every\r\ntrader in Lynn was perpetually reminded that in Norwich, only fifty\r\nmiles or so distant, the citizens had held their own borough court\r\nsince 1194, and the higher court with view of frankpledge since 1223.\r\nFor these privileges they themselves had waited now for three hundred\r\nyears, and only one settlement was possible. In 1473 the quarrel as\r\nto the view of frankpledge was still going on,[547] but the bishop\r\nwas driven at last to a compromise which preserved his historic\r\nclaims untouched in theory, while it handed over the real power to\r\nthe municipality. For the sake of peace he consented in 1528 to lease\r\nto the mayor and burgesses the yearly Leet, the Steward’s Hall Port,\r\nand the Tolbooth Port;[548] besides various dues from fairs and\r\nmarkets, with waifs and strays, and some other rights. A ruder and more\r\neffective close was before long put to the quarrel by the sharp methods\r\nof the Reformation, when Bishop’s Lynn became finally the King’s Lynn.\r\n\r\nII. If boroughs attached to a bishopric were in a difficult position,\r\nthe difficulty was vastly increased in the case of those subject to\r\nthe lordship and rule of a monastery. Towns owned by abbot or prior\r\nwere like all the rest stirred by the general zeal for emancipation,\r\nbut they were practically cut off from any hope of true liberty. The\r\npower with which they had to fight was invincible. Against the little\r\nlay corporation was set a great ecclesiastical corporation, wealthy,\r\ninfluential, united, persistent, immortal. All the elements which went\r\nto make up the strength of the town were raised in the convent to a yet\r\nhigher degree of perfection, and the struggle was prolonged, intense,\r\nand at the best remained a drawn battle, setting nothing beyond dispute\r\nsave the animosity of the combatants. Sometimes the defeat of the\r\nborough in the fifteenth century was as complete as it had been two\r\nhundred years before. Cirencester which had won extended privileges\r\nfrom Henry the Fourth in return for political services in his time of\r\ndifficulty, was utterly beaten at last,[549] and fell back under the\r\ncontrol of the Abbey as completely as St. Alban’s had done in earlier\r\ntimes.[550] In other cases the resistance was more energetic and\r\nsustained, and some slight measure of success was its reward.[551]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of towns on feudal estates, any borough that possessed\r\ntraditions of freedom handed down from a state of larger liberties\r\nmight have some hope of ultimate success, but otherwise rebellion could\r\nonly issue in defeat so final and decisive as to leave no further room\r\nfor argument. Under the impulse of the popular movement which seems\r\nto have agitated many towns after the rising that took place in the\r\ndays of Simon de Montfort, the men of S. Edmundsbury kept up for about\r\nseventy years a desperate struggle with the abbot who ruled them. For\r\nin 1264 it happened that “the younger and less discreet” of the town\r\norganized a conspiracy under colour of a Guild called “the Guild of\r\nYoung Men,” and despising altogether the ancient horn of the community\r\nset up a new common horn of their own. Three hundred and more of\r\nthese hopeful conspirators, known by the name of “bachelors,” having\r\nbound themselves to obey no bailiff save the aldermen and bailiffs\r\nof their own Guild, to answer to the sound of their new common horn\r\ninstead of the old moot horn, and to count all who did not join them as\r\npublic enemies,[552] soon found themselves engaged in riotings and in\r\nviolently resisting the abbot from behind closed gates. On the abbot’s\r\nappeal to the Crown, however, the town grew frightened; the Guild was\r\nannihilated by the help of the more prudent sort, and the insurrection\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nIn less than thirty years, however, the burghers were renewing the\r\nmemory of their old offences—forcing townsmen against their will to go\r\nto the hall of the Guild, and take an oath of allegiance to it; levying\r\ntolls and taxes, distraining on merchants who sold in the abbot’s\r\nmarket to extort money from them; hindering the execution of justice on\r\nmerchants suspected of selling goods outside that market; and refusing\r\nto allow any member of the guild to bring a plea in the abbot’s court\r\nagainst any other brother of the guild: while the abbot on his side\r\nasserted his right to choose the alderman of the town and to appoint\r\nthe keepers of the gates. In spite of a compromise made before the\r\nking’s judges sent the next year to enquire into the case, the same\r\ncharges were again brought against the men of Bury before a royal\r\ncommission of judges in 1304. The accused confessed that the abbot was\r\nlord of the whole town and its courts, but they still urged a claim\r\nto be free burgesses and to have an alderman, and a Merchant Guild\r\nwith certain rights of justice belonging to it and with an elaborate\r\ncode of procedure, and asserted their right to hold meetings for the\r\ncommon profit of the burgesses, and to levy taxes from men trading in\r\nthe town. All this the abbot denied, whether the right to a Merchant\r\nGuild, or pleas belonging to it, or a community, or a common seal, or\r\na mayor; according to him the townsfolk only had a right to a drinking\r\nfeast, which they maliciously turned into an illegal convention, and\r\nif they took any fines it was against the merchant law and the King’s\r\npeace. The case was given for the abbot. The leaders were fined and put\r\nin jail, some of them escaping by payments while others through poverty\r\nlay in prison a month.\r\n\r\nOnce more, however, the burghers took heart, and in 1327 broke into\r\nthe abbey and forced the abbot to concede to them a community, a\r\ncommon seal, a Guild merchant, and custody of their gates, with other\r\nliberties. But their triumph was short; utterly defeated by the\r\nforces of abbot and king, they were forced in the concord of 1332 to\r\nrenounce for ever the claim to a community;[553] and when after the\r\nPeasant Revolt there was much general begging for pardon, the men of S.\r\nEdmundsbury, who were ordered to sue for their pardons specially, had\r\nto find surety not only to the King but to their lord the abbot.[554]\r\n\r\nIf S. Edmundsbury was one of the most unfortunate ecclesiastical towns\r\nReading was perhaps the most fortunate. For Reading was originally\r\na borough on royal demesne, which was granted by Henry the First to\r\nthe new monastery founded by him.[555] From this time the town lay\r\nabsolutely in the control of the abbot. He owned all its streams, from\r\nwhich the inhabitants had “chiefly their water to brew, bake, and dress\r\ntheir meat.”[556] The mills were in his hands; he did as he chose with\r\nthe market, controlled the trade, and had the entire supervision of\r\nthe cloth manufacture. He appointed the Warden of the Guild or mayor,\r\nand the various town officers; and claimed a decisive voice in the\r\nadmitting of new burgesses or members of the Guild, while from every\r\nburgher’s son who entered the Guild he claimed a tax of 4_s._, and from\r\nevery stranger one-half of the fine paid as entrance fee—the sum of\r\nthe fine being fixed in presence of a monk who might raise objections\r\nso long as he was not overborne by the joint voices of six legal men\r\nof the Guild. Every burgher in the Guild had further to pay to him a\r\nyearly tax of _chepin gavell_ for the right of buying or selling in the\r\ntown.[557] For any breach of the law fines were gathered in to increase\r\nhis hoard, since all the administration of justice lay in his hands.\r\nBefore the abbot alone the emblems of supreme authority might be borne,\r\nand the mayor when he went in state was only allowed to have two tipped\r\nstaves carried before him by the abbot’s bailiffs.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Henry the Third there was unceasing war between the\r\ntownsmen and their lord. Violent dissensions broke out in 1243, when\r\nthe burghers “lay in wait day and night for the abbot’s bailiffs,” and\r\n“hindered them from performing their duties,” till order was restored\r\nby a precept from the King.[558] The townsfolk were appeased by the\r\ngrant of certain trading privileges; but ten years later the quarrel\r\nbroke out again. The abbot, as they maintained before the King’s Court\r\nat Westminster, had taken away their Guild, summoned them to another\r\nplace than their own Guild Hall to answer pleas, changed the site of\r\ntheir market, and forced them to render unwonted services. An agreement\r\nwas drawn up before the judges, by which the burghers won the right to\r\nhold their corn market in its accustomed place, to own their common\r\nGuild Hall, with a few tenements that belonged to it, and a field\r\ncalled Portmanbrok (the rent of which was set apart for the salary of\r\nthe mayor), and to maintain their Guild merchant as of old. On the\r\nother hand the townspeople conceded that it was the abbot’s right to\r\nselect the Warden of the Guild from among the guildsmen, and require\r\nhim to take oath of fidelity to himself as well as to the burgesses.\r\nThe abbot might tallage the town at certain times, and his bailiffs\r\nwere still to administer justice, and might at any time claim the keys\r\nof the Guild Hall, sit there to hold pleas, carry off all profits to\r\nthe abbot’s treasury, and fine the burgesses any sum which it was in\r\ntheir power to pay. Finally it was admitted that the meadow beyond the\r\nPortmanbrok belonged to the lord.[559]\r\n\r\nAfter an arrangement which left to the abbot all the weighty matters\r\nof government, the control of the burghers’ trade and a charge on\r\ntheir profits,[560] it was no wonder that before a hundred years were\r\nover the inhabitants of Reading, restless and discontented, were again\r\nbattling for larger privileges. In 1351 the mayor and commonalty\r\nrefused obedience to a constable appointed by the abbot’s steward,\r\nclaiming for themselves the right to choose the constables, and present\r\nthem to take their oaths before the king’s justices and the justices\r\nof the peace instead of before the abbot. At the same time they raised\r\nvarious fundamental questions as to their rights, just as Lynn was\r\ndoing almost in the very same year. They asked whether the town was not\r\na royal borough and therefore in no way dependent on the abbey; whether\r\nthe townsmen had not therefore a right to elect their own mayor;\r\nand whether that mayor ought not to exercise jurisdiction over the\r\nburgesses and commonalty “according to the custom of the borough and\r\nGuild”—questions which one and all afforded fair subjects of dispute\r\nfor the next hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe burghers henceforth gave the abbot no rest. In the long quarrel the\r\nMerchant Guild became the real centre of the common activity, just as\r\nit did wherever a town subject to a lord temporal or spiritual failed\r\nto win independent jurisdiction of its own.[561] For if there were free\r\nboroughs where the mayor, with his council and the common assembly of\r\nthe burghers in which the whole conduct of government was centred, were\r\nin name and fact the accepted constitutional authorities; on the other\r\nhand in dependent towns where political freedom was still incomplete\r\nthe Merchant Guild appears as ostensibly the only means by which the\r\nwill of the community could find expression; as men recognized in it\r\nthe one society in whose disciplined ranks they might be enrolled to\r\nfight for the liberties they claimed, its organization was held to\r\nbe the most important of their privileges and the truest symbol of\r\ntheir common life; and it necessarily became the bond of fellowship,\r\nthe pledge of future freedom, the school of political energies.[562]\r\nIn such towns therefore the Merchant Guild had a vitality and a\r\npersistent continuity of life which was unknown elsewhere, and was\r\noften preserved in full vigour two or three centuries after it had\r\nperhaps suffered decay or transformation elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis was the case in Reading. The burghers fell back on the Guild as\r\nthe one authorized mode of association for public purposes, and in its\r\n“morghespeche,” or “morning talks,” the leading townsfolk discussed\r\nhow the independence of the borough might be advanced. Successive\r\nmayors of the Guild, though still to all appearance appointed as\r\nofficers of the abbot, became really the representatives of the town,\r\nidentified themselves absolutely with its interests, and readily led\r\ntheir fellow citizens in revolt against the convent. In 1378 the\r\nburghers paid about £5 for a new charter; and twice sent the mayor\r\nto London to assert their privileges, and to insist that the convent\r\nshould be forced to bear a just share of the burden of taxation, and\r\npay a part of the tenth demanded by the King. The messengers were\r\nlavish with their gifts to judges and officers and lawyers who might\r\nbefriend them, eels and pike, perches and salmon and capons; and\r\nsucceeded so well that the town charters were confirmed in 1400, in\r\n1418, and in 1427.[563] In 1391 the burghers carried the dispute about\r\nthe appointment of constables to the king’s judges at Westminster;\r\nand seem to have succeeded in this matter too, for in 1417 the mayor\r\nelected the constables in the Guild Hall, and the justices of the peace\r\nadmitted them to office. About 1420 a Guild Hall was built close to the\r\nHallowed Brook, though the burghers complained of being “so disturbed\r\nwith beating of battle-dores” by the women washing in the brook that\r\nthey could scarcely hold their courts or do any public business.[564]\r\nThey made payments for the clock house, and set up a bell for the\r\ncommunity,[565] and appointed a permanent salary for the mayor of five\r\nmarks, to be paid from the Common Chest instead of the uncertain rent\r\nof the Portmanbrok. But when they went on to build a new “Outbutchery,”\r\nand buy “smiting stocks” for butchers not living in the town, the\r\nabbot at once saw an attempt to limit his own market profits which he\r\nimmediately resented, denying the burghers’ right to hold their new\r\nout-butchery or receive rents from it. They on their side protested\r\nthat their Guild was a body corporate, having a Common Hall, a seal,\r\nand the right of possessing common property; that they held also a\r\nwharf, a common beam or weighing-machine, and the stocks and shambles;\r\nthat they had been granted freedom from toll throughout the kingdom;\r\nthat they returned two burgesses to Parliament; and were freed from\r\nshire and hundred courts; and finally they asserted, to sum up all\r\nthe rest, that they had held of the King long before the monastery was\r\nfounded.[566] In 1431 lawyers were appointed to search the evidences\r\nin the Common Chest as to agreements between the town and the abbot.\r\nAt the same time a Register of the Acts of the mayor and burgesses was\r\nbegun, and continued year after year without break. In 1436 and 1439\r\npayments were made for the writing out of certain articles as to the\r\nprivileges of the town; and counsel were again employed to look over\r\nthe evidences in 1441.[567]\r\n\r\nThroughout these years the mayor and officers were constantly at\r\nMaidenhead, London, or Canterbury, holding consultations about legal\r\nbusiness with Lyttleton and the most famous lawyers. They succeeded in\r\nbuying a charter for their Guild Hall with sums contributed by rich\r\ncitizens; and gratefully adorned the building with a picture of the\r\nKing. The mayor of the guild became more and more the representative\r\nof the burghers’ hopes, and his greatness the symbol of their triumph.\r\nThey had not only raised his salary in 1459 to ten nobles,[568] but\r\nlike their brethren at Lynn they got permission from Henry the Sixth\r\nto have a mace carried before him; and in 1459 the mace was actually\r\nbought.[569] At this extravagance, however, the abbot made a firm\r\nstand, and Henry had to send a letter to the Mayor of Reading, just as\r\nhe had done eleven years before to the mayor of Lynn, ordering that\r\nthis privilege should remain with the abbot alone as the token of his\r\nsupremacy. But the mayor possibly gained his point a little later, for\r\nin 1487 he was allowed two Mace-serjeants, so it would seem that at\r\nleast his tipped staves were now borne by his own servants.[570] He\r\nsecured too for himself and for the burgesses exemption from serving on\r\njuries; and in the same year assumed supervision of the cloth trade.\r\nIn 1480 the burgesses had done away with individual payments of the\r\n“chepin gavell” tax to the abbot, by ordering that it should be given\r\nfrom the Town Chest; and in 1486 a citizen bequeathed property for its\r\npayment, so that the townsmen were henceforth freed from all personal\r\ndifficulties in this matter.[571]\r\n\r\nEither the question of the cloth-market or that of the mace-serjeants\r\nbrought the battle to a climax. The abbot absolutely refused to\r\nappoint any “master of the guild, otherwise called mayor,” and took\r\nupon himself to admit such people as he chose to the office of\r\nconstable.[572] The guild retorted by choosing a mayor for themselves,\r\nwho nominated his own officers to keep order, while all alike in this\r\nemergency gave their services freely, for in 1493 “nothing was paid to\r\nthe mayor, because neither he nor any one else charged anything on the\r\noffice.”[573] In the case of the lesser offices the burghers held their\r\nown, and when in 1499 the abbot appointed two constables, the mayor\r\nthrust them out of their places.[574]\r\n\r\nBut the triumph of the people was short-lived, for in the long run they\r\nproved powerless against the great spiritual corporation which ruled\r\nover them. In the very next year, 1500, the inhabitants were utterly\r\ndefeated as to the election of the mayor himself; and as they still\r\nprotested, there was once more an appeal eight years later to the\r\njudgment of the King’s Court. The verdict of the judges threw back the\r\nwhole question almost to the very point where it had stood centuries\r\nbefore at the time of the earlier appeal in 1254, and the brethren of\r\nthe Guild were declared of ancient time to have had no other right\r\nthan the power to present from among themselves three persons, of\r\nwhom the abbot should choose one as mayor. The two constables, and\r\nthe ten wardmen of the five wards, might be elected by the mayor and\r\ncommonalty, but they must be sworn in before the abbot. According to\r\nancient custom the name of any proposed burgess must be given to the\r\nabbot fourteen days before his election, and a monk must be present for\r\nthe assessing of his fine of forty shillings, half of which went to\r\nthe abbot; an alien’s fine might be determined by six burgesses, and\r\nif they affirmed on oath that the fine was reasonable the abbot was\r\nbound to accept it. The question of the out-butchery still remained\r\nundecided; but the dispute as to the cloth-trade was settled by a\r\ncompromise. As in the case of the mayor, the town was to choose three\r\nmen and present them to the abbot, who should then appoint one of the\r\nthree to be the keeper of the seal for sealing the cloth.[575]\r\n\r\nSo closed for the moment the long struggle of two hundred and fifty\r\nyears—a struggle whose gain was small in comparison with all the\r\ncost and labour, the civic enthusiasm, the learning and ability which\r\nhad been lavished on it. The easy passage to freedom by which the\r\nroyal towns had travelled, the large and regular expansion of their\r\nliberties, the liberal admission of their right to supremacy over\r\ntheir own trade and over the higher matters of law and justice, might\r\nwell kindle in the subjects of abbey and priory a perpetual unrest,\r\nand anger deepened against their masters as they saw themselves, in\r\nan age of universal movement, bound to the unchanging order of the\r\npast, and condemned to perpetual dependence under a galling system of\r\nadministration which the secular government had abandoned three hundred\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBATTLE FOR SUPREMACY\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN a borough had won from its lord full rights of self-government,\r\nits battles were not yet over. The next effort of the town authorities\r\nwas to secure complete power over all the inhabitants within their\r\nwalls, so that they might compel all alike to submit to the town\r\ncourts, and to bear their share of burdensome duties, such as the\r\npayment of taxes, the keeping watch and ward, the defence of the town,\r\nthe maintenance of its trade, or the enlargement of its liberties—in\r\nfact to take their part as good citizens in all that concerned the\r\ncommon weal.\r\n\r\nFor all towns alike, whatever were their chartered rights, had to\r\nreckon not only with their own lord of the manor, but with the great\r\npeople, whether king or noble or bishop or abbot, or perhaps all of\r\nthem together, who might own a part of the land within their walls,\r\nand might all assert their various and conflicting rights, and\r\nmultiply officials of every kind with courts and prisons and gallows,\r\nto vindicate the lord’s authority. Thus in Warwick in the eleventh\r\ncentury, when the population was scarcely over a thousand, the King\r\nheld a hundred and thirteen houses, and various lords and prelates\r\nowned a hundred and twelve, while there were nineteen independent\r\nburgesses who had the right of sac and soc. So also in the time of\r\nEdward the First there were five gallows in Worcester and the district\r\nimmediately round the city. One belonged to the town, another to the\r\nbishop, and a third to the Earl of Gloucester, while two more were\r\nset up by the abbots of Pershore and Westminster who held property in\r\nthe borough; all of which lords and prelates had the right of hanging\r\nthieves and rioters in this little community of about two thousand\r\ninhabitants.[576]\r\n\r\nA new municipality, face to face with these traditional claims, and\r\npowerless before the customary rights of property, could only fall\r\nback on friendly treaties by which both sides might win advantage\r\nfrom peaceable compromise. As soon as the burghers had won chartered\r\nprivileges of trade and freedom from toll throughout the kingdom, they\r\nhad something to offer to their neighbours, and the bargaining began.\r\nThey could propose to grant protection and a share in their privileges,\r\nand would demand in return that the tenants of alien lords should\r\ncontribute to their taxes and take part in public duties, and perhaps\r\nacknowledge, in some respects at all events, the authority of their\r\ncourts. But the progress of the negociations and their final result\r\nunderwent considerable modifications, according as the townspeople had\r\nto deal with the constable of the King’s castle; with some lord who\r\nheld property in the borough; or with an ecclesiastical settlement,\r\nwhether cathedral or monastery, planted within the liberties.\r\n\r\nI. The Castle Fee was a bit of the royal territory altogether\r\nindependent of the municipality. In Bristol, for example, the castle\r\nhad its own market at its gate; and its inhabitants were exempt from\r\nthe town justice, so that if one of the tenants of the fee committed\r\na crime he was sent to Gloucester thirty miles distant instead of\r\nbeing tried in Bristol itself. Since the castle fee lay outside the\r\njurisdiction of the town, its ditches became the refuge of felons and\r\nmalefactors flying from the bailiffs, and as late as 1627 it was stated\r\nthat two hundred poor persons were dwelling within the precincts who\r\nmostly lived by begging, besides a number of outlaws, excommunicated\r\npeople, and offenders who found them a hiding place, and when soldiers\r\nand sailors were impressed great multitudes of able men “fled thither\r\nas to a place of freedom, where malefactors live in a lawless\r\nmanner.”[577] From his position as the king’s lieutenant the governor\r\nor Constable of the Castle in important frontier or seaport towns was\r\na very great official, with an authority as military commander which\r\ngave him the right of interference in local affairs, and whose power\r\nmight easily prove a real danger to municipal institutions.[578] In\r\nBristol, where the mayors after their election “did fetch and take\r\ntheir oath and charge at the castle gate” from the constable as the\r\nrepresentative of the King, he was practically the official arbiter in\r\nany crisis of town politics, and when a revolt of the commons broke out\r\nin 1312 against a handful of merchants who controlled the municipal\r\ngovernment, the party in power at once claimed the constable’s help\r\nagainst their fellow-townsmen. Thereupon the commons assaulted the\r\ncastle and built forts against it, so that the forces of three counties\r\nwhich were marched to the rescue by their sheriffs could not quell the\r\nriot; but the castle party finally triumphed, the insurrection was\r\nviolently put down, twelve burgesses banished, the rule of those who\r\nhad usurped privileges claimed by the whole commonalty confirmed, and\r\nthe enemy of the Bristol burghers, Lord Maurice of Berkeley, appointed\r\nby the King “custos of the castle and town.”[579]\r\n\r\nIt was only however in a few boroughs that exceptional military\r\ndifficulties made the post of governor one of great or permanent\r\nauthority, as for instance in Bristol or Southampton. And even in\r\nthese towns a good understanding was before long established between\r\nking and burghers, and powers exercised by royal officers which\r\nimpeded the free developement of municipal life were withdrawn without\r\njealous alarms on the sovereign’s side, or prolonged agitation on the\r\npart of the town. The Bristol mayors were freed by royal charter from\r\nthe necessity of taking their oath from the constable in 1345. And\r\nin towns such as Norwich, where military considerations early became\r\nof comparatively little importance, the castle tenants were made to\r\ncontribute to the city taxes in the thirteenth century, and in the\r\ncourse of the next hundred years, were put unreservedly under the\r\ncontrol of the city authorities.[580]\r\n\r\nII. There were not very many cases where a lay lord became a formidable\r\nenemy to municipal freedom, either from the extent of his property\r\nin a town, or from his power of enforcing his claims. Such disputes\r\nas did arise were settled in various ways by purchase or friendly\r\ncompact, or by gaining from the Crown a charter which conferred such\r\nrights of control as were necessary for discipline and order. Boroughs\r\non the royal demesne naturally found themselves supported by the King\r\nin urging these demands, but the appeal to force always lay behind\r\nthe legal settlement, and there was occasionally a serious battle\r\nbefore the question of supremacy was finally decided. A bitter fight\r\nwas waged between Bristol[581] and the lords of Berkeley, who owned\r\nRedcliffe, and claimed the river where they had built a quay as part\r\nof their lordship; who had their own courts and their own prison; who\r\nheld their own markets and fair; and who broke the Bristol weights and\r\nmeasures, and refused to take the measures of assize from the mayor\r\neven though in such matters he acted as the King’s marshal. They fought\r\nlong and fiercely for their power, even after a royal charter in 1240\r\nhad given the jurisdiction over Redcliffe to the mayor.[582] In 1305\r\nan energetic young lord Maurice of Berkeley to whom his father had\r\ngiven Redcliffe Street tried to assert his rights, but at the ringing\r\nof the common bell the Bristol men assembled, broke into Maurice’s\r\nhouse, took away a prisoner from him, and refused to allow him to hold\r\nany court, or to buy and sell any wares in Redcliffe Street. Upon this\r\nthe young lord, appearing with “great multitudes of horse and foot,”\r\nforced the burgesses to do suit to him, and cast those who refused\r\ninto a pit, while the women who came to help their husbands in the\r\nfray were trodden under foot. He set free prisoners from the Bristol\r\ngaol, assaulted Bristol burgesses at Tetbury fair, claimed dominion\r\nover the Severn, and seized the Bristol ships. All this did Maurice,\r\n“than whom a more martial knight, and of a more daring spirit, of the\r\nage of twenty-four years, the kingdom nor scarce the Christian world\r\nthen had;” and the mayor and burgesses left King and Parliament no rest\r\nwith their petitions, telling of outrage after outrage committed by\r\nhim, till commissioners were appointed to examine their complaints, and\r\nto Lord Maurice the sequel of this angry business was a fine of 1,000\r\nmarks, afterwards commuted to service with the King’s army with ten\r\nhorsemen. A few years later moreover the Bristol men found opportunity\r\nto avenge their bitter grudge, for when he was taken in rebellion the\r\nmayor and the commonalty, “out of an inveterate hatred and remembrance\r\nof former passages,” threw into the common gaol every man who was even\r\nsuspected of having adhered to the faction of Maurice.[583] Troubles\r\nagain broke out in 1331, and the mayor and burgesses gathered at the\r\nringing of the common bell for an assault on a Lord Thomas of Berkeley,\r\ndestroyed his tumbrill and pillory, carried his bailiff to the Guild\r\nHall, and forced him to swear that he would never again execute any\r\njudgements in the courts. The next year however the town, “taking the\r\nadvantage of the time while the said lord was in trouble about the\r\nmurder of King Edward the Second in his castle of Berkeley,” settled\r\nthe matter for ever by an opportune payment to the King of £40, for\r\nwhich the mayor and burgesses obtained a confirmation of all their\r\ncharters, and especially that which granted that Redcliffe Street\r\nshould be within their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the dispute finally decided than rancour quickly died\r\naway, and the burgesses of Bristol settled down into the most friendly\r\nrelations with Berkeley castle. The lords of Berkeley took to trading\r\nin wool and corn and wine, and went partners with Bristol men in\r\nrobbing carracks of Genoa as well as in lawful traffic.[584] So far had\r\nthe wheel of fortune turned that one of the lords who made a treaty of\r\npeace with the Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury meekly appeared before\r\nthe mayor and council of Bristol to give surety;[585] and when he went\r\nout to fight at Nibley the Bristol merchants sent men to his help.[586]\r\nThe alliance was cemented by marriage when a Berkeley in 1475 took\r\nto wife a daughter of the mayor of Bristol;[587] and when she died\r\nin 1517 the mayor, the master of the Guild, the aldermen, sheriffs,\r\nchamberlains, and wardens of Bristol, and thirty-three crafts, followed\r\nthe coffin with two hundred torches—altogether a multitude of five or\r\nsix thousand people. A “drinking” was made by the family for the mayor\r\nand his brethren in St. Mary’s Hall, at which they were entertained\r\nwith a first course of cakes, comfits, and ale, followed by another\r\nof marmalade, snoket, red wine, and claret, and a third of wafers and\r\nblanch powder, with romney and muscatel; “and I thank God,” wrote the\r\nsteward, “no plate nor spoons was lost, yet there was twenty dozen\r\nspoons.”[588]\r\n\r\nIII. Ecclesiastical corporations also nominally held their property in\r\nthe various towns by the usual feudal tenure, just like the lay lords;\r\nand when a borough formally stated its theoretic relations with them\r\nboth lay and spiritual lords were put on exactly the same level. The\r\n“Customs” of Hereford show us the ideal view of these relations as the\r\nburghers liked to picture them. “Fees” within the walls[589] were held\r\nby both ecclesiastical and lay lords, whose tenants desired a share in\r\nthe city privileges, and the Hereford men classed them all together\r\nunder a common description. “There are some lords and their tenants\r\nwho are dwellers and holders of lands and tenements within the said\r\nbounds, which they hold by a certain service which is called ‘liberum\r\nfeodum’; because long ago they besought us that they might be of us,\r\nand they would be rated and taxed with us, and they are free among us\r\nconcerning toll and all other customs and services by us made, but\r\nconcerning their foreign services which they do, or ought to do, and of\r\nold have done, their lords are not excluded by us nor by our liberties;\r\nfor we never use to intermix ourselves with them in any things touching\r\nthose tenures, but only with those which concern us, or their tenures\r\nwhich for a time hath been of our condition.”[590] Tenants still bound\r\nto render feudal services to their lords were not reckoned among the\r\ntrue aristocracy of the freemen, who in admitting them to a limited\r\nfellowship marked their sense of the difference of status between the\r\nfree burgher and the man who was but half emancipated; “and such men\r\nought not to be called citizens or our fellow citizens ... because they\r\nare ‘natives,’ or born in the behalf of their lords, and do hold their\r\ntenements by foreign services and are not burgesses.” It was only when\r\na tenant bought a house in the city and was in scot and lot with the\r\ncitizens, that they allowed that he “is free and of our condition; but\r\nlet him take heed to himself that he depart not from the city to any\r\nplace into the power of his lord.”[591]\r\n\r\nBut the municipality was perfectly firm in the assertion of the\r\nauthority which it had a right to exercise over all those who were\r\nadmitted to the privileges of the common trade, and took a very decided\r\ntone with the spiritual as well as with the lay lords. To the Hereford\r\nburghers it was obvious that the ecclesiastical tenants only enjoyed\r\na share in the town liberties by the grace of the citizens, and in\r\nvirtue of “a composition betwixt us and them, which we for reverence\r\nto God and to the Church our mother had granted the same unto them;\r\nand also for divers alms to be given to our citizens and other poor\r\nand impotent of our city in an almshouse by the keeper of the same\r\nfor ever. And it was not our intentions that these men, the tenants\r\nof the bishop, dean, and chapter should have nor enjoy our laws and\r\ncustoms, unless after the same manner as we enjoy them”—that is, as\r\nthey went on carefully to explain, every one must acknowledge law as\r\nwell as privilege, and be subject like the citizens to authority. They\r\nwere all to be obedient to the Bailiff for the execution of the King’s\r\nwrits; nor could they claim any immunities or independent jurisdiction\r\nin the King’s highway, seeing that all offenders taken there were to\r\nbe judged by the city Bailiff. If the peace or the tranquillity of\r\nHereford was disturbed by the tenants of any fee, the city Bailiff,\r\n“taking with him the bailiff of that fee and twelve of the most\r\ndiscreetest and stoutest men of the whole city,” might “by all way of\r\nrigour” compel the offenders to come before them, and force them to end\r\ntheir discords and make amends; if they refused, the whole community\r\n“shall account and hold them as rebels; and that they come not among\r\nthem in their congregations.”[592] All bailiffs, whether of Church\r\nestates or others, were bound to help the chief Bailiff of the city in\r\napprehending thieves and malefactors and keeping order. A vagabond,\r\neven if he were an ecclesiastical tenant, who made a noise at night “to\r\nthe terror of his fellow-citizens,” might be taken up by any inhabitant\r\nand brought to the city jail till one o’clock the next day; when, in\r\npolite recognition of the lower jurisdictions, he was solemnly handed\r\nover in a public place to the bailiff of his own fee, by him to be kept\r\nin prison for a day and a night, and then returned to the city prison,\r\n“there to stay until he hath made amends as the Bailiff and commonalty\r\nshall think fit.” The tenants of the various fees were allowed to\r\nplead in the town courts at their pleasure, a privilege not granted to\r\naliens; and in matters touching frankpledge, or anything “which could\r\nnot be amended in the courts of those lords,” the city claimed rights\r\nof arbitration, and power to determine such cases “according to the\r\nlaws of the city and not according to the customs, unless it be by\r\nspecial favour of the commonalty.”[593] All questions concerning lands\r\nand tenements in the city were to be decided by the free citizens only;\r\nand if ecclesiastical tenants refused to submit to the jurisdiction of\r\nthe city magistrates and absented themselves from the court, “then our\r\nchief Bailiff, calling unto him six or more witnesses of his citizens,\r\nshall go to the cathedral church, and there before the chapter shall\r\nnotify or declare the disobedience of their bailiffs and of their\r\ntenants.” If the canons would not assist or agree, the Bailiff should\r\nannounce that he must then proceed himself to administer full justice,\r\nthough “by his will or knowledge he would not hurt the liberties\r\nof their mother the Church.” This concession to ecclesiastical\r\nsensibilities was apparently looked on by the men of Hereford as a\r\nproof of fine magnanimity. “And it was not wont so to be done, but that\r\nthere was a composition had between us, which we for the reverence of\r\nGod and the tranquillity of their tenants and our citizens, had granted\r\nunto them.”\r\n\r\nAll this story, however, comes to us from the side of the town, and\r\nhas something of the ring of a lordly municipal pride; it almost sounds\r\nlike an ideal view of the compromise between the contracting powers as\r\nconceived by the burghers, and one to which the Church party must have\r\ndemurred. At any rate by whatever means the municipality of Hereford\r\nhad won a jurisdiction of this sort over the bishop’s tenants, it was\r\nsingular in the possession of such authority, which has no parallel in\r\ntowns like Canterbury, York, Lincoln, Norwich, Exeter, and many more.\r\nBut the situation, even as the citizens put it, is so complicated in\r\nits arrangements that we could scarcely wonder if a state of truce\r\ndepending on provisions so elaborate should under provocation be\r\ntransformed into a state of open war; nor can we question the wisdom of\r\ntownspeople everywhere in making it their fixed purpose to establish\r\none undivided and supreme law for the government of each community. How\r\nimportant the question at issue really was to the town’s life we may\r\nsee from the story of Winchester.\r\n\r\nThe mayor of Winchester was at the head of what seems, on paper at\r\nleast, a powerful and elaborate corporation, worthy of a great city\r\nwhich held itself to have been built “in the age of the world 2995,\r\nninety-nine years before the building of Rome,” and “environed with\r\nstone walls” exactly 533 years later.[594] A common assembly met twice\r\na year. There were two coroners and two constables, six aldermen of\r\nthe wards with their six beadles, a town clerk and four serjeants,\r\na council of twenty-four elected every year, and four auditors of\r\nthis council, besides a body of twelve jurors chosen whenever there\r\nwas necessity, who sat at “the Pavilion,” and with whom the mayor\r\nperambulated the liberties to view the rivulets and rivers.[595] The\r\nboundaries of the city were apparently marked out by a rough square\r\nformed by the walls and ditch; but to the mayor and aldermen of the\r\nfifteenth century, the idea that their authority should reach as far\r\nas the limits allowed by the girth of the walls would have seemed a\r\nfar-off counsel of perfection.\r\n\r\nFor right across the city from the east to the west gates stretched the\r\nHigh Street, cutting the town into two equal halves; and to the south\r\nof the High Street one may say roughly that the mayor had no authority\r\nat all. Near the west gate stood the King’s castle, where municipal\r\nlaw of course did not run. Beside the castle lay the great convent of\r\nS. Swithun, and next to it the cathedral, both fenced round by a wall\r\nwhich shut out all lay jurisdiction or intrusion of any kind. Nearer\r\nto the east gate lay the palace of the bishop, who was also of course\r\nexempt from secular interference, and who ruled with supreme authority\r\nover the bishop’s Soke that stretched away beyond the gate, and took\r\ntolls of all merchandise that passed along the river.[596] His tenants\r\nwhile remaining outside municipal control had still the right to buy\r\nand sell all kinds of merchandize in the city which according to the\r\nburghers’ complaint was to their hurt and loss; and the exceeding\r\ndifficulty of any regulation of trade in the midst of this competition\r\nof privileged workers, with the ruin of the city treasury which it\r\nthreatened, are shown by a quarrel between the bishop and the burghers\r\nas to a street which the bishop had claimed as his property in 1275;\r\nfor when people discovered that in that liberty so appropriated they\r\npaid nothing, since the city bailiff could not enter it to make\r\ndistraint, nearly all the clothworkers forthwith withdrew themselves\r\nfrom the other streets and went to live there to the manifest loss of\r\nthe community, and the great profit of the bishop.[597]\r\n\r\nThe northern part of the town was more than half given up to fields\r\nand gardens, the shops and houses of traders and artizans forming but\r\na narrow settlement that gathered closely along the central street and\r\nthe lanes that opened from it. And even of this district a part was\r\nwholly withdrawn from the city jurisdiction. The Queens, whose “morning\r\ngift” Winchester was, lived “tax free” in the Queen’s House opposite\r\nthe King’s palace near the west gate, and took rent and tolls from the\r\nrow of Queen’s stalls on the High Street. At the east gate was another\r\nbelt of ecclesiastical property—the settlements of the Franciscans and\r\nDominicans,—and next to them a group of poor houses depending on S.\r\nSwithun’s.[598] Right in the middle of the town, opposite the Guild\r\nHall in the High Street, was the liberty of “Godbeate” belonging to S.\r\nSwithun’s, where the writ of the King or the authority of the city had\r\nno power; and whose church formed a sanctuary always open for ill-doers\r\nflying from municipal justice. The very curfew-bell which hung in its\r\ntower rang out from land that defied the mayor’s authority.[599]\r\n\r\nWinchester had not even control of its own gates. The bishop had charge\r\nof one; and two were in the hands of the convent, which in times of\r\ncivil war could freely admit within the city walls the armies of the\r\nside opposed to the townsfolk.[600] Even the commerce of the place\r\nwas taken out of the burghers hands. Not only did the bishop take\r\ntolls of the river traffic, but once a year when the great fair of S.\r\nGiles’ took place he assumed supreme command in Winchester; for the\r\ntime all civic government was altogether suspended; the bishop closed\r\nall shops in and round the town; traders coming with their cloth and\r\nwoollen goods, their wines, their pottery, their brass-work, or their\r\neastern spices, were subject to his jurisdiction, and handed over to\r\nhim the biggest share of the profits, which he divided with the various\r\nreligious establishments in the city.[601] At other times the King’s\r\nchamberlains and the King’s clerk of the market regulated business in\r\ntheir master’s interest, and collected the dues of the market and tolls\r\non every load carried by man or horse into the town.[602]\r\n\r\nWinchester suffered also from the memory of its ancient state as the\r\ncapital and residence of the West Saxon Kings; and its mayor almost\r\nalone among the mayors of English towns in the fifteenth century had to\r\ngo to London to take his oath of office from the King’s judges,[603]\r\njust as the mayor of London does to this day. He could win neither\r\nfreedom nor independence. At home he was beset with dangers; he might\r\nbe imprisoned by the King for one offence, and punished by the bishop\r\nfor another.[604] Against such odds as the burghers had to face it\r\nwas almost hopeless for any corporation to contend; and the helpless\r\ntownsfolk could but show their impatience and discontent in petty\r\nquarrels with the convent as to the site of a market, or blindly do\r\nbattle for worthless Kings such as Henry the Third or Edward the\r\nSecond if the monks took up the opposite party.[605] The struggle\r\nfor independence has no fine record of stirring incidents; but that\r\nthere should have been any conflict at all before the settling down of\r\nquiescence and final apathy is a striking instance of the vitality and\r\npersistence of municipal institutions.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to attribute to the hopeless situation of the\r\nmunicipality before the rival authorities in the city, and especially\r\nthe powerful lords of convent and cathedral, much of the calamity of\r\nits history. For at a time when prosperity was generally increasing,\r\nits fortunes steadily sank. In 1450 the citizens drew a terrible\r\npicture of the local distress, not in the vague phrases which we meet\r\nwith elsewhere when for some special purpose happier boroughs put on a\r\ntemporary show of distress, but with a minute exactness which betrays\r\nthe truth and the whole measure of their suffering. Winchester, they\r\ndeclared, “is become right desolate.” Nine hundred and ninety-seven\r\nhouses stood empty, and in seventeen parish churches there was no\r\nlonger any service. A list is given of eleven streets “that be fallen\r\ndown in the city of Winchester within eighty years last passed”; and in\r\neach case an account is added of the number of householders that had\r\nformerly lived in the street, a hundred, a hundred and forty, or two\r\nhundred, as the case might be, where there were now but two or three\r\nleft. Since the last Parliament held there eighty-one households had\r\nfallen. “The desolation of the said poor city is so great, and yearly\r\nfalling, for there is such a decay and unwin, that without gracious\r\ncomfort of the King our sovereign lord, the mayor and the bailiffs\r\nmust of necessity cease, and deliver up the city and the keys into\r\nthe King’s hands.”[606] To produce a distress such as this no doubt\r\nindustrial causes were at work, and Winchester probably suffered as\r\nCanterbury did from changes in the woollen manufacture and in trade\r\nroutes. But nowhere in any considerable city do we find a parallel\r\nto the utter ruin of this unfortunate community. Nowhere, on the\r\nother hand, were the conditions of municipal life so fatal, if once\r\nprosperity began to dwindle or the pressure of outward circumstances\r\nbecame such as to call on the resources of the people. Through the\r\nbreaking up of the city into separate and independent fragments\r\nthe whole burden of any difficulty had to be borne by the little\r\ncompany of inhabitants governed by the mayor; and so heavily did the\r\ncommon municipal charges and expenses fall on the scanty population\r\nof burghers shut into the narrow area which was under municipal\r\ngovernment, and from which alone the authorities could gather the\r\nfee-farm and the royal taxes, maintain the bridge and walls, provide\r\nhouseholders for the nightly watch, and furnish men and arms for the\r\ndefence of the city; and we do not wonder that the inhabitants at last\r\nbegan to renounce, or refuse to accept, a franchise which brought such\r\nformidable responsibilities, or that they sought to escape from a city\r\ndoomed to ruin. An attempt was made in 1430 to revive manufacture\r\nand commerce by an invitation to all kinds of traders and artificers\r\nto come and do business in Winchester free of toll.[607] But the\r\nexperiment in free trade was quickly abandoned, probably because the\r\ncorporation could not meet the heavy yearly expenses without the\r\ncustomary taxes levied on trade;[608] and in 1450 the citizens laid a\r\npetition before Henry the Sixth, praying him to consider the extent of\r\ntheir distress. They were bound, they said, to pay yearly a rent of\r\n112 marks to the King, “for the which said fee-farm so to be paid your\r\nbailiffs have little or naught of certainty to raise it of, but only\r\nof casualties and yearly leases £40 or more.” There was further a sum\r\nof £50 10_s._ 4_d._ for the tax of the fifteenth, “the which when it\r\nis levyable, some one man in the said city is set unto four marks and\r\nsome five marks, because your said city is desolate of people.” Then\r\ncame a sum of 60_s._ to be paid yearly to the Magdalen Hospital;[609]\r\nand besides that there were the expenses of two burgesses to Parliament\r\nwho cost 4_s._ a day; “and also the great charges and daily costs the\r\nwhich your said poor city beareth about the enclosing and murage of\r\nyour said city.”[610] To add to all their trouble a grant which the\r\nking had made to the municipality in 1439 of forty marks from the\r\nulnage and subsidies of woollen cloths had been withdrawn again; and\r\nthe commonalty sadly entreat that it may be restored.\r\n\r\nThe King allowed the payment of the forty marks during the next fifty\r\nyears, and Winchester made one or two further attempts at mending its\r\nfortunes. The people of Southampton had as long ago as 1406 succeeded\r\nin obtaining a license from the bishop of Winchester, to buy and sell\r\nwithin their town during the fair of St. Giles;[611] and the mayor and\r\ncommunity of Winchester perhaps hoped to follow this example. In 1451\r\nthey raised a debate as to the franchises and customs of the fair,\r\nand interfered with the bishop’s privileges; but their usual ill luck\r\npursued them and they were obliged to submit and give a promise that\r\nhe should never again be disturbed from having the keeping of the city\r\nand the customs aforesaid.[612] A few years later a transient gleam of\r\nhope was cast across the unhappy town when the Italian merchants were\r\ndriven out of London in 1456, and in this sudden emergency hired the\r\n“great old mansions”[613] which the Winchester traders had allowed to\r\nfall into decay, putting the owners to heavy expenses for repairs. But\r\nthey seem never to have occupied the mansions after all. Perhaps they\r\nwere disheartened by the sense of failing trade and oppressive taxes;\r\nor they possibly feared the dangers that might come to them in a town\r\nthat had never been allowed powers to govern and defend and deal fairly\r\nby its own townsfolk. In any case they left the big empty houses to go\r\nto Southampton, and Winchester was none the better.[614]\r\n\r\nWinchester was an extreme instance of difficulties which were felt\r\nin every other town in a greater or less degree. For scarcely any\r\nimportant borough was without some ecclesiastical settlement within\r\nits walls, and everywhere the dispute took the gravest form. With the\r\nKing or with a neighbouring lord the boroughs might make terms of\r\npeace, or impose conditions as conquerors, but their most imposing\r\ndemonstrations were inevitably routed before the power of the Church.\r\nOutbreaks of popular fury in which from time to time the irritation\r\nof the burghers found expression have often been represented as\r\nsymptoms of a spirit of malice and misrule by which an ignorant mob was\r\ninstigated to attack the most beneficent institution known to their\r\nsociety and with no justification save from their lawless temper seek\r\nto appropriate to themselves its privileges and possessions. But the\r\ncauses of the conflict were more valid and serious. As the instances\r\ngiven in the next chapter prove, the burghers learned by a genuine\r\nexperience to gauge the beneficence of the Church’s claims to temporal\r\nauthority. There does not seem to have been in England, as there often\r\nwas abroad, the additional stimulus of religious revolt, for the\r\npractical townspeople apparently did not find the slightest difficulty\r\nin distinguishing between spiritual influence and secular jurisdiction,\r\nmainly perhaps because the power of the ecclesiastical potentates in\r\nEngland was of so limited a kind as to awaken but a moderate fear\r\nand equally moderate excitement. But in face of the secular problem\r\ncreated by the presence of a rival authority ruling over half the\r\nspace enclosed in the town walls—an authority with which no permanent\r\nagreement could ever be concluded and which was manifestly fatal to\r\nthe dignity or the success of municipal government—the boroughs were\r\nforced, as a mere matter of self-preservation, into insistent and\r\nreiterated demands that this double rule should be abolished, and\r\nthat there should be but one undivided and supreme control in each\r\ncommunity for civil affairs. When the pole-axes and daggers with\r\nwhich they at first sought to enforce their convictions were laid\r\naside, they turned to the law-courts and the paper wars of Westminster\r\nto seek a remedy for their grievances; and it is in the records of\r\ntrials from the middle of the fifteenth century to the Reformation in\r\nwhich the pleadings of both sides may be heard that we find the real\r\njustification of the burghers’ claim to civic supremacy, and of their\r\ndetermined assaults on the political independence of ecclesiastical\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE TOWNS AND THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the history of Winchester we may perhaps find a clue to the\r\nexplanation of that great controversy which for centuries divided the\r\nmediæval municipalities and the religious corporations into two hostile\r\narmies,—armies that chafed under the restraints of an enforced and\r\nangry truce, and from time to time broke into the brief exhilaration of\r\na free fight. There were certain towns, such as Exeter or Canterbury\r\nor Norwich, where the municipality was as free as royal charters could\r\nmake it and acknowledged no dependence on Cathedral or Priory, and\r\nwhere notwithstanding Town and Church were always in arms against one\r\nanother, and the task of adjusting their mutual relations presented\r\nsuch insoluble difficulties that every other question seemed of easy\r\nsettlement in comparison with a problem so insistent, so manifold in\r\nits forms, so tremendous in its proportions in the eyes of burgher\r\nand of ecclesiastic. The convent or chapter, entrenched behind its\r\ncircuit of walls and towers, with its own system of laws, its own\r\nexecutive, its independent trade and revenues, had practically no\r\ninterest either in the prosperity or the security of the town, while\r\nits keenest activities, whether from the point of view of business or\r\nreligion, were enlisted in uncompromising defence of ecclesiastical\r\nprivilege. On the other hand the body of burghers, conscious of the\r\ndifficulties of government, with a mass of complicated business thrown\r\non their hands and a heavy financial responsibility, nervously keeping\r\nguard over their franchises, inspired by a commanding sense of the\r\nimportance of strict organization, and an ambition stimulated by\r\ntradition, success, and capacity, found in common experience reasons\r\nfor judging that a double system of law and a double authority was\r\nthe negation of order, peace, or material prosperity in their little\r\nrepublic. Their avowed object was to put an end to this division of the\r\nborough into two camps, and to secure for the community the ultimate\r\ncontrol of administration within the city boundaries. Hence the issues\r\nraised between the townspeople and the clerical order were direct and\r\nclear. Questions of temporal and spiritual power, of ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction, of the immunities claimed by the “clergy,” of the\r\ngulf that separated the servant of the Church from the citizen of\r\nthe State—all these things were forced home to the people with the\r\nsharpness, variety, and force of practical illustration. The war which\r\nin the twelfth century had been waged on behalf of the State and the\r\nChurch by their great representatives, Henry the Second and Archbishop\r\nThomas, was during the next three centuries brought down into every\r\nborough and fought out there in more humble fashion by provincial\r\nmayors and ecclesiastics of a circumscribed and stinted fame.\r\n\r\nAnd as the quarrel was long so it was practically universal. It\r\nwas this that made the struggle so momentous. Few boroughs after\r\nall were subject to the absolute rule of ecclesiastical lords; and\r\ntheir attempts to win freedom were local, isolated, without national\r\nsignificance. But all the great towns had one or more ecclesiastical\r\nbodies established within their boundaries, and all were able to\r\nappreciate the character of the conflict entailed on them. Nor were the\r\nconsequences of the dispute exaggerated by the combatants on either\r\nside. During centuries of strife they had abundant opportunity of\r\ngauging its importance—from the time of Edward the First, when, by\r\nthe enclosing of churchyards and ecclesiastical precincts with walls,\r\nthe attempt was made to shut in religious authorities within their\r\nown limits, and give the town undivided responsibility outside these\r\nboundaries—till the time when triumphant burghers saw walls and towers\r\nlevelled to the ground under Henry the Eighth.\r\n\r\nFor in the war waged by burghers against clerics who used spiritual\r\nauthority to create temporal sovereignty, and in this temporal power\r\nthen found means to enforce spiritual claims,—though the combatants\r\nwere people of no account, fighting their quarrel out in remote and\r\nisolated boroughs, and though the noise of the battle no longer\r\nresounded as it had once done throughout Europe,—the conflict was\r\nstill the same, the questions were as vital for the just ordering of\r\nhuman society, and the tenacity of the opponents was as great as ever.\r\nThe disputes covered the whole field of practical life. In matters of\r\ntrade there was not only the rivalry of two trading companies under\r\ndifferent conditions of wealth, influence, and protection;[615] but\r\neven in the case of individuals there was unfair competition, as when\r\na citizen gave up his dwelling in the town, obtained a corrody in some\r\necclesiastical house, and claimed the benefits of citizenship without\r\nbearing its obligations.[616] Sometimes the burghers found themselves\r\ncalled to defend against the ecclesiastical lawyers a right which had\r\nbeen proved essential to their freedom—the right of being tried only\r\nin their own courts—and the commonalty would make ordinances that\r\nno process-server should carry or cite elsewhere men or women living\r\nin the borough, and the jury of the Leet Court kept watch and made\r\ntheir presentment of summoners, commissary, and clerks who had dealt\r\nlightly with the liberties or goods of the citizens, or called them to\r\ndistant courts.[617] Or again, the invaluable privilege of having all\r\nmatters that concerned the commons of the borough tried by a jury of\r\ninhabitants and not of aliens, might be put in jeopardy. In Lincoln\r\nthe dean and chapter had a special grudge against trials “by people\r\nof the same city, which be so favourable one to another that they\r\ndoubt not to make false oaths, and that because they be encouraged,\r\nforasmuch as they have not been before this time convict by foreigners\r\nby colour of their franchise.” On their complaint “our lord the King,\r\nwilling, for the cause aforesaid, _to provide for the quietness of the\r\nsaid church_, and full right to be done as well to the said bishop,\r\ndean, and chapter and their successors,” ordered that henceforth “if\r\nany of the parties feel himself grieved of a false oath made by such\r\nassize, jury, or inquest, the attaint shall be granted to him, and the\r\nrecord sent by writ into the King’s Bench or into the Common Pleas;\r\nand that the sheriff impanel the jury of such attaint of foreigners\r\nof the county, without sending to the franchise of the said city, and\r\nthat the justices shall take the same jury of the same foreigners,\r\nnotwithstanding any franchise granted to the same city, or other usage\r\nto the contrary.”[618] The question of sanctuary, too, remained a\r\nstanding trouble, and the bailiffs of the borough who sent town clerks\r\nand town serjeants to make proclamation for weeks together at the abbey\r\ngate calling upon a debtor who had fled from his creditors to appear\r\nfor judgement, had small sympathy with the abbot’s privileges.[619]\r\nWhenever burghers had liberty and opportunity to act on their own\r\njudgement they found no difficulty in coming to a decision as to the\r\nsanctity imposed by religion on territories consecrated to sacred\r\nuses. From old premises they drew new conclusions. “As holiness becomes\r\nthe Lord’s House,” declared the mayor, jurats, and whole community\r\nof Rye in 1483, “in future, to the honour of God and of the glorious\r\nVirgin Mary, the parish church of the said town, with the churchyard\r\nand the manse of the vicarage thereof, shall be of the same freedom,\r\nand with as much liberty as the other houses of the freemen, especially\r\nas to arrests and other matters.”[620]\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no better illustration of the character and conditions\r\nof the controversy between town and church than the story of the\r\nquarrel between Exeter city and the Cathedral, which has been preserved\r\nfor us in the letters of an able mayor, who at a very important crisis\r\nconducted the case of his fellow-citizens against the chapter, and\r\nwhose phrases, written in the heat of battle, carry us back into\r\nthe very midst of a long-forgotten strife. Descended from an old\r\ncounty family which had thrown in its lot with the burghers of Exeter\r\nand become traders in the city and leaders in its counsels, John\r\nShillingford was born into a tradition of civic patriotism. His father\r\nserved as mayor from 1428 to 1430 and was noted for being learned in\r\nthe law; and John Shillingford himself was mayor three times, and the\r\ndistinguished leader from 1445 to 1448 of a struggle for independence\r\nwhich was already a hundred and fifty years old.\r\n\r\nFrom 1206 or earlier Exeter had been governed by its own mayor and\r\nbailiffs, and the citizens held their town at a fee-farm rent from\r\nthe King. But a century later the mayor was a mere dependent of the\r\nEarl of Devonshire, wearing his “livery” as one of his retainers\r\nand acknowledging his protection. However it happened on a certain\r\nday in 1309 that the earl and bishop made an attempt to buy all the\r\nfish in the Exeter market, leaving none for the townsfolk. Then the\r\nmayor, “minding the welfare of the commons of the said city, and that\r\nthey also might have the benefit of the said market,” ruled that\r\none-third of the fish must be given to the citizens. The earl with\r\nloud threatenings angrily ordered his rebellious dependent to appear\r\nbefore him. Followed by a tumultuous procession of “his brethren and\r\nhonest commons of the said city,” the mayor went from the Guild Hall\r\nto the earl’s house, entered his lord’s “lodging chamber,” and there\r\ntook off his “livery” coat and gave it back to the earl once for all,\r\nthe commons meanwhile beating at the door and loudly demanding their\r\nmayor, till the terrified earl entreated him to quiet their clamour.\r\nThe town forthwith passed a law that no citizen should ever again\r\nwear “foreigner’s livery,” and so began the long fight for municipal\r\nindependence.[621]\r\n\r\nFor the same two great powers ever kept watch on the Exeter citizens\r\nand their market, if by chance there was any profit which could be\r\nturned their way. At the town gates the Earls of Devonshire held Exe\r\nIsland and the adjoining suburb, commanded the navigation of the Exe,\r\nforced the mayor to lay aside his mace as he approached the suburb,\r\nand sought to recall the days when he had worn their livery. A more\r\ndangerous enemy was encamped within the walls. Just opposite the\r\nlittle town-hall rose the great wall with its towers which guarded\r\nthe bishop’s palace, the cathedral, and the ecclesiastical precincts;\r\nand within this fortified enclosure ruled an august power that defied\r\nthe petty upstart forces of the mayor and his group of shopkeepers\r\noutside. The conflict of the town with the Earls,[622] if it lasted for\r\nsomething like three hundred years, was still of minor significance.\r\nThe conflict with the Church was far more dangerous in form and serious\r\nin its issues.\r\n\r\nThe town and the close, as we are told by the mayor in 1448, had\r\n“been in debate by divers times almost by time of eightscore years,\r\nand that I could never know, find nor read that we ever took a suit\r\nagainst them, but ever stand in defence as a buckler player, and smiter\r\nnever.”[623] Now at last, however, the citizens were resolved “once to\r\nsmite, taking a suit,”[624] as became the temper and traditions of the\r\nfifteenth century when such quarrels were fought out, not with clubs\r\nand daggers, but in the “paper wars of Westminster.” As the crisis\r\napproached the townsfolk made ready for the fray. Determined that\r\ntheir battle should be conducted by the most capable man among them,\r\nat Michaelmas, 1444, they elected as their mayor John Shillingford.\r\nHe refused to accept office, upon which they sent to Westminster and\r\nprocured a writ under the Privy Seal ordering him either to submit or\r\npay a fine of £1,000, a sum which probably no single individual in\r\nExeter at that time possessed. In February 1445 therefore, he “came\r\nto the Guild Hall and there was sworn; and though at the first with\r\nan evil will, yet in the end did perform it very well,”[625]—so\r\nwell indeed that the bishop even saw in “the wilful labour of John\r\nShillingford” the main cause of all “the great hurt and loss of the\r\nsaid church and city.”[626]\r\n\r\nOnce Mayor Shillingford quickly threw down his challenge to the\r\nchapter. On Ascension Day, 1445, the city serjeant followed a servant\r\nof the chancellor into the precincts, and there arrested him when he\r\nwas actually taking part in a procession, holding up from the ground\r\nhis master’s golden cope;[627] and two more arrests of clerks followed\r\nin a little over a year. A new mayor took his place at Michaelmas\r\n1445, but when in April 1446 the chapter prepared to bring a suit\r\nagainst the town, laying the damages at £1,000, the city again fell\r\nback on Shillingford and for the two critical years of the strife he\r\nremained supreme magistrate and led the fight as it broadened so as\r\nto cover the whole range of the civic life. Party strife ran high,\r\nand the inhabitants were soon on terms of open war. On one occasion\r\nin the midst of the quarrel, a great stack of wood which lay between\r\nthe cathedral and the town was set on fire at nine o’clock in the\r\nshortest time of the year. This, the burgesses cried out, was done\r\nby the ministers of the cathedral to burn down the town. The charge\r\nwas thrown back in their teeth by the canons, who protested it was set\r\nafire by men of the same city deliberately by consent of the commonalty\r\nwith intent to burn the church.[628] The tossing to and fro of such an\r\naccusation gives us a glimpse of the state of feeling that existed. The\r\ncathedral party hated the townspeople as a usurping and rebellious mob;\r\nwhile to the townsfolk when their passion was aroused the cathedral\r\nwithin its walls wore the aspect of a fortress in their midst, held by\r\nthe power of an ancient enemy.\r\n\r\nWhich was the “smiter” in the quarrel it would be indeed hard to say.\r\nThe claims raised on either side were absolutely irreconcilable, and\r\neach denied with great frankness and conviction every assertion put\r\nforward by the other. For convincing proof of its own dignity the\r\ncorporation boldly carried back its inquiries to some unknown period\r\nbefore the Christian era, when Exeter “was a city walled, and suburb to\r\nthe same of most reputation;” and recounted how “soon upon the passion\r\nof Christ it was besieged by Vespasian by time of eight days; the which\r\nobtained not the effect of his siege, and so wended forth to Bordeaux,\r\nand from Bordeaux to Rome, and from Rome to Jerusalem, and then he\r\nwith Titus besieged Jerusalem and obtained and sold thirty Jews’\r\nheads for a penny, as it appeareth by Chronicles.” They then passed\r\non to its position under the Saxon Kings; and thence came directly\r\nto the privileges of the mayor, derived from the good old time when\r\nbailiffs and citizens held the town in fee-farm from the King, before\r\nany monastery or cathedral church was built.[629] All the historical\r\nresearch on this side in fact plainly proved the ecclesiastical\r\nauthority to be a mere modern usurpation, of no credit or value.\r\n\r\nThe bishop and chapter for their part ignored the times before\r\nVespasian, and bluntly “say that they doubt of Vespasian’s being at\r\nExeter, and so at Bordeaux and Jerusalem, to sell thirty Jews’ heads\r\nfor a penny;” so coming at once to their main contention, they declared\r\nthat St. Stephen’s Fee was no parcel of the city, as the Book of\r\nDomesday would show, and was indeed “of elder time than is the city,”\r\nfor Exeter was nothing more than a borough till the first bishop had\r\nbeen installed there by the Confessor. Indeed they observed that the\r\nmayor himself was well known to be an officer of yesterday, since till\r\nthe time of Henry the Third there “was no mayor nor fee-farm,” but\r\nthe town was governed by the sheriff of the county, and the bishops\r\nin their sphere had absolute jurisdiction, “without that time out of\r\nmind there were any such mayor, bailiffs, and commonalty known in the\r\ncity.”[630]\r\n\r\nBut all the arguments of the bishop, “that blessed good man in himself\r\nif he must be Edmund, Bishop of Exeter,”[631] as the mayor politely\r\nremarked, were thrown away on Shillingford. “I said nay, and proved\r\nit by Domesday,”[632] he writes, fully satisfied that my lord “had\r\nno more knowledge of the ground of this matter than the image in the\r\ncloth of arras there”[633]—a melancholy ignorance, “considering his\r\nblessedness, holy living, and good conscience.” The prelate’s history,\r\nindeed, like that of his antagonist, was not without reproach. Domesday\r\nmakes no mention of any separate lands of the Church in Exeter; but\r\ncopies of Domesday were scarce, and it was tolerably safe to refer to\r\nits authority. In any case, however, the daily pressure of circumstance\r\nwas so strong that it mattered very little to the opposing forces\r\nwhether ancient history justified their position or no. To the burghers\r\nthe difficulties of a divided administration, and the humiliation of\r\nsubmission, were made more galling every day by the growing prosperity\r\nof the town and the independent temper of the time; while the chapter,\r\nconfident in the legal strength of their position, had not the least\r\nhesitation in forcing on the conflict.\r\n\r\nThe suit which opened in London in 1447 was complicated and\r\ncostly,[634] and mayor and law officers and town councillors in\r\nExeter had to put forth all their resources. Perpetual consultations\r\nwere carried on in the Town Hall with the help of much malmsey; once\r\ntwo plovers and a partridge helped the feast. As time went on the\r\nexpenses in meat and drink were heavy; judges had to be feasted, and\r\nthe municipal officers encouraged, and presents were needed for the\r\ngreat folk in London, besides the serious cost of sending messengers\r\ncontinually to London, Tiverton, and Crediton. Even after the matter\r\nwas finally decided the city had to make up in the next year rewards of\r\nmoney, and gifts of fish and wine, for which it was still in debt.[635]\r\n\r\nThe most arduous and costly part of the work, however, lay in the\r\nvast amount of historical and legal research which the case demanded.\r\n“It asketh many great ensearches,” said Shillingford, “first in our\r\ntreasury at home among full many great and old records; afterward at\r\nWestminster, first in the Chancery, in the Exchequer, in the Receipt,\r\nand in the Tower; and all these ensearches asketh great labour long\r\ntime as after this, to make our articles we have many true against one\r\nof theirs.”[636] Evidences and documents were read and re-read, and\r\narguments brought from the Black Roll of the city, from Domesday Book,\r\nfrom Magna Charta, from statutes, charters, and letters patent, from\r\nthe eyres holden at Exeter by the judges of Edward the First, from\r\nrecords of the “customs” under Henry the Third or Edward the Third. The\r\nRecorder of Exeter worked hard, and the mayor turned confidently to\r\nhim when legal questions became peculiarly obscure. It “is dark to my\r\nconceit as yet,” he writes from London; “but I trust to God it shall be\r\nright well with your good information and help thereto; to which intent\r\nI send you a roll in the which is contained copies of Domesday, copy of\r\neyres, of charters, and other things that is necessary to be seen in\r\nmaking of these replications. I can no more at this time, but I pray\r\nyou be not weary to over-read hear and see all the writing that I have\r\nsent home to you at this time; and if you be, no marvel though I be\r\nweary, and God be with you.”[637]\r\n\r\nShillingford himself was constantly in London; where the record of one\r\nday’s work may serve as an instance of his activity. He left Exeter at\r\n6 o’clock on Wednesday morning, and reached London on Saturday at 7\r\nA.M. “That day I had right great business,” he says. First he went to\r\nthe Exchequer to see about Exmouth Port; then to Westminster Hall to\r\nspeak with various lawyers; after that he visited the chief justice,\r\nSir John Fortescue, and rode with him homeward; then he called on\r\nanother justice, Sir Richard Newton; from thence he went to commune\r\n“with our counsel of our matters;” and in the afternoon proposed to\r\nvisit the archbishop at Lambeth.[638] Meanwhile he kept a certain watch\r\nover affairs at home, and sent an occasional order as to the conduct of\r\nlocal business in Exeter. “Also I charge Germin (the treasurer) under\r\nrule and commandment of J. Coteler, my lieutenant, that he do that he\r\ncan do, brawl, brag and brace, lie and swear well to, and in special\r\nthat the streets be right clean and specially the little lane in the\r\nback-side beneath the flesh-fold gate, for there lieth many oxen heads\r\nand bones, that they be removed away for the nonce against my coming,\r\nas soon as I may by cokky’s bones.”[639]\r\n\r\nFrom London long letters to the “Fellowship” at home rehearsed every\r\nstep of the negociations, from the moment when the mayor first “came\r\nto Westminster soon upon nine of the bell, and there met with my lord\r\nchancellor at the broad door a little from the stair-foot coming from\r\nthe Star Chamber, I in the court, and by the door kneeling and saluting\r\nhim in the most goodly wise that I could, and recommended unto his\r\ngood and gracious lordship my fellowship and all the commonalty, his\r\nown people and bedesmen of the city of Exeter. He said to the mayor\r\ntwo times ‘Welcome’ and the third time ‘Right welcome, mayor,’ and\r\nheld the mayor a great while fast by the hand, and so went forth to\r\nhis barge and with him great press, lords and other.”[640] In the same\r\nway Shillingford notes carefully every detail of the grave ceremonial\r\nobserved before the arbiters of the city’s destiny, when “my lord\r\ntook his chair and the justices sat with him, and both parties with\r\ntheir counsel kneeled before.”[641] Then followed a long argument in\r\nwhich the mayor held his own against the lawyers, and “so we departed,\r\nstanding afar from my lord, and he asked wine and sent me his own cup,\r\nand to no more;”[642] also “my lord in this time did me much worship\r\nand openly ... commended me for my good rule at home.” When a letter\r\nfrom the mayor was addressed to the lord chancellor, we hear how the\r\nrecorder “kissed the letter and put it into my lord’s blessed hand, and\r\nmy lord with a glad countenance received the letter, and said that the\r\nmayor and all the commons should have Christ’s blessing and his, and\r\nbade my master Radford[643] to stand up, and so did, and anon my lord\r\nbrake the letter even while grace was saying, and there right read it\r\nevery deal or he went to his dinner.”\r\n\r\nBusiness in London was best furthered by judicious gifts, and Exeter\r\nwas constantly called on to send fish to the chancellor—conger eel,\r\n400 of buckhorn or dried whiting, or a “fish called crabs.”[644]\r\nOr again when the prudent mayor heard the lord chancellor bid the\r\njustice to dinner for a Friday, “I did as methought ought to be\r\ndone ... and sent thither that day two stately pickerellis and two\r\nstately tenches.”[645] This proved a very successful venture, as “it\r\ncame in good season” for the great lords and bishops who dined with\r\nthe chancellor that day. At one stage of the business indeed the\r\nmayor thought it unwise to proceed with his argument until a certain\r\npresent of fish should arrive. “I tarried and yet tarried because of\r\nthe buckhorn, the which came not yet, me to right great anger and\r\ndiscomfort by my troth ... for it had been a good mean and order,\r\nafter speaking and communication above-said, the buckhorn to have been\r\npresented, and I to have come thereafter, and so to have sped much the\r\nbetter; but now it is like to fail to hindering.”[646] Whether it was\r\nthe fault of the treasurer of the town, or of the carrier, he did not\r\nknow; he was sure each would accuse the other. “Christ’s curse have\r\nthey both,” he breaks out, “and say ye amen, _non sine merito_, and but\r\nye dare say so, think so, think so!” At last the buckhorn arrived on\r\nCandlemas even—”better late than never,” said the irritated mayor.\r\n“That day was I at Lambeth with my lord at mass, and offered my candle\r\nto my lord’s blessed hand, I kneeling adown offering my candle. My lord\r\nwith laughing cheer upon me said heartily ‘Graunt mercy, mayor;’ and\r\nthat same day I abode there to meat by my said lord’s commandment; I\r\nmet with my lord at high table end coming to meatward, and as soon as\r\never he saw me he took me fast by the hand and thanks enough to; I said\r\nto my said lord it was too simple a thing considering his estate to\r\nsay on his ‘graunt mercy,’ but if I had been at home at this fair he\r\nshould have had better stuff and other things. I went forth with him\r\nto the midst of the hall, he standing in his estate against the fire a\r\ngreat while, and two bishops, the two chief justices, and other lords,\r\nknights and squires, and other common people great multitude, the hall\r\nfull, all standing afar apart from him, I kneeling by him, and after\r\nrecommendation I moved him of our matter shortly as time asked.” He\r\nclosed this argument against the prelate’s malpractices in his most\r\ngraceful manner—”I in my leave-taking saying these words, ‘My lord\r\nhave pity and mercy upon that poor city, _Jesus vidit civitatem et\r\nflevit super eam_.’”[647]\r\n\r\nBut amid all the fashions of the chancellor’s court the mayor never for\r\na moment lost the sense of his own dignity as the representative of a\r\nfree city. Deferential and scrupulous in paying the grave courtesies\r\nof an exact formality, Shillingford was inflexible in all that lay\r\nbeyond mere ceremonial; for, as he said, “the matter toucheth the\r\ngreat commonalty of the city of Exeter as well as him.”[648] “The said\r\nmayor,” he writes on one occasion, “conceived and knew right well\r\nthat his said lord bishop took unworthy, as he might right well, for\r\nsimpleness and poverty to speak or entreat with him. Nevertheless he\r\nsaid, such simple as he was, he was Mayor of Exeter.”[649] In every\r\ndilemma he fell back haughtily on his own “simpleness,” and on his\r\nsubjection to the town council at home, “having no power, nor nought\r\nmay do, say, agree, nor assent, without a communication had with my\r\nfellowship—a commonalty which is hard to deal with,”[650] added the\r\nartful mayor, with a humour which his submissive subjects at Exeter\r\ndoubtless fully appreciated.[651]\r\n\r\nWe may safely assume that great labour and cost were not expended\r\nwithout some serious reason by the Exeter citizens—a community of\r\nhard-working practical traders, who knew the value both of their time\r\nand their money. And in the mayor’s accounts of the proceedings in\r\nLondon we can gather up the long list of grievances which had gone on\r\naccumulating within the walls of this little city between Church and\r\nState, till the inhabitants found themselves ranged in two hostile\r\narmies, to either of which surrender meant ruin and enslavement.\r\n\r\n(1) The most burning question at issue was the right of arrest of the\r\nbishop’s tenants, or within the ecclesiastical precincts. Among many\r\nother cases[652] the mayor alleged that of one “Hugh Lucays, tenant\r\nof the said bishop, the most, or one of the most, misgoverned men\r\nof all the city of Exeter, or of all the shire afterward,” who made\r\na fray upon a townsman at the very door of the Guild Hall, and when\r\nthe sergeant seized him “brake the arrest and went his way” into the\r\nchurch, pursued by the two serjeants. The stewards of the city who\r\nfollowed with the king’s mace to keep the king’s peace found the church\r\ndoors shut upon them, and the prisoner “violently with strong hand\r\ntaken away from them”; and various clerks and ministers of the church,\r\nby order of the dean and chapter, fell on them with door-bars, swords,\r\ndaggers, long-knives, and “Irish skenes,” so that “both stewards and\r\nserjeants stood in despair of their lives, and scarce escaped out of\r\nthe church with their lives.”[653] This was the mayor’s story. The\r\nbishop on his part said that Hugh Lucas was an innocent man, who was\r\ndriven into the cathedral during divine service by the turbulent mob\r\nof burghers brandishing “swords, daggers, and other invasive weapons,”\r\nand intent only on wickedness and misrule.[654] Then again one of the\r\nbishop’s servants who had struck a townsman in the eye with a dagger\r\nalmost unto death, could not be punished because he had been standing\r\nwithin the Close gate, between the cemetery and the city. “Also\r\nofttimes the mayor hath not dared do the law and execution thereof\r\n... for now almost every man taketh colour by my lord” the bishop. If\r\nany riotous person made a fray, he would run off and “take the church\r\nlate;” if a man was arrested on Saturday, “he must be delivered to\r\nmake my lord’s work” on Sunday,[655] and by such devices both men and\r\nwomen “by whom the mayor is rebuked” got off scot free. A compromise\r\nhad been made that the city officers should make no arrests in church\r\nor cemetery from the ceasing of Our Lady bell to the end of Compline,\r\nbut the chapter later laid this against them in evidence that they had\r\nno right ever to make any arrest there, “which is to the said mayor\r\nand commonalty great vexation, hurt, and hindering; and to misgoverned\r\nmen, rioters, and breakers of the peace great boldness.”[656] The mayor\r\nalleged that it was impossible to keep order in face of privileges\r\nwhich rendered the clergy and their tenants practically independent\r\nof the law. “Night walking, evil language, visaging, shouldering, and\r\nall riotous rule” went on unchecked, seeing that the mayor “could no\r\nlonger rule the King’s people after his laws, nor do right as he is\r\nsworn to, for dread of my lord.”[657] Just outside St. Peter’s Close\r\nstood a well-known tavern, and the canons who owned the Broad Gate kept\r\nits wicket open almost all the night, “out of which wicket into which\r\ntavern cometh the great part of all the rioters into the Close, priests\r\nand others,” said the townspeople, and there made sleep impossible the\r\nwhole night long to the neighbours. The canons however held that the\r\n“mayor and such dreadful people of his commonalty be the misgoverned\r\npeople and incomers that they spoke of.” According to the clerical\r\nparty indeed the whole municipal body was altogether sunk in sin; the\r\nvery town serjeants were “wild and unreasonable fellows,” who had even\r\nbeen heard to threaten “that there should many a priest of the Close\r\nof Exeter lose his head once of midsummer even;”[658] and as for the\r\ntavern, it was wholly the mayor’s business to keep order there, unless\r\nindeed, as they suggested, it was he himself “that is cause and giver\r\nof example to all such misgovernance.”[659] This charge, however, which\r\nthe chancellor had struck out with his own hands, was one about which\r\nthe mayor did not greatly trouble himself. “As touching the great venom\r\nthat they meaneth of my living,” he wrote to the Fellowship, “I take\r\nright nought by and say sadly ‘_si recte vivas_,’ etc., and am right\r\nmerry and fare right well, ever thanking God and my own purse. And I\r\nlying on my bed at the writing of this right early, merrily singing a\r\nmerry song, and that is this ‘Come no more at our house, come, come,\r\ncome!’ I will not die nor for sorrow nor for anger, but be merry and\r\nfare right well, while I have money; but that is and like to be scarce\r\nwith me, considering the business and cost that I have had and like\r\nto have; and yet I had with me £20 and more by my troth, whereof of\r\ntroth not right much I spend yet, but like, &c. Construe ye what ye\r\nwill.”[660]\r\n\r\n(2) It was a further grievance to the townspeople that the bishop\r\nclaimed the right to hold both a court baron and leet and view of\r\nfrankpledge, and on this pretence called before himself various\r\npleas and matters that should have been tried before the mayor and\r\nbailiffs, thus covetously gathering into his coffers fines on which\r\nthey themselves had set longing eyes; and moreover that he took to\r\nhimself any goods seized from felons.[661] There had been angry\r\nfeeling over the case of one John Barton, whom the town officers\r\npursued for robbing. But as it was a church that he had robbed, and\r\nas he had hidden the stolen goods in a tenement of the bishop’s, the\r\necclesiastics, rather than see justice done by the secular power, had\r\nshut the door in the face of the municipal officers, and had hurried\r\noff the sacrilegious thief into the cathedral, then smuggled him out\r\ninto a bakehouse, and so conveyed him out of the city; while the stolen\r\ngoods were kept with a strong hand to the use of the bishop, “to great\r\nhurt and hindering of our sovereign lord the King and the said mayor\r\nand commonalty.”[662]\r\n\r\n(3) In all towns where the question of jurisdiction was raised between\r\nthe townsfolk and the Church party the quarrel about coroner’s\r\ninquests ran high. Churchmen and laymen alike had to submit to the\r\ncoroner’s inquest. But chapters of cathedrals and monasteries found\r\nit less humiliating to admit within their precincts an officer of the\r\nshire than the town officer sent in by a mayor who was for ever keeping\r\nhis jealous watch at their gates. On the other hand, after their long\r\nand determined struggle to be freed from foreign interference, the\r\ntowns looked with suspicion on the appearance within their walls on any\r\npretext whatever of any official of the shire. In Exeter as elsewhere\r\nthe city coroner claimed “to corowne prisoners dead in the bishop’s\r\nprison,” but the bishop flatly refused to admit into the precincts\r\nany officer save the coroner of Devonshire, and if the municipal\r\ncoroners on hearing of a prisoner’s death appeared at the gates of the\r\nClose, they were turned back by “servants of the said bishop, and by\r\nhis commandment they were let to do their office there; and the said\r\nprisoners so dead buried uncoroned.”[663]\r\n\r\n(4) There was also as might be expected a burning controversy as to the\r\ncity taxes.[664] The mayor alleged that he and his deputies had been\r\naccustomed to collect in the cathedral precincts a certain proportion\r\nof the King’s taxes, the ferm, and the sums needed for general town\r\nexpenses; and Shillingford supported this claim before the lord\r\nchancellor by “a long rehearsal thereof from King Edward’s time unto\r\nthis day, how and under what form it was done of old time.”[665] Of\r\nlate however the bishop’s tenants had refused to come to the Guild Hall\r\nand have their share assessed, “by the commandment of the said bishop\r\nmenacing the said tenants ... to put them out of their tenures. And so\r\nthey durst not come, set, nor pay as they have been wont to do.”[666]\r\nThe bishop justified his action by a variety of arguments. The King’s\r\ntaxes he probably could not dispute with any show of reason. But with\r\nregard to the ferm he employed a comprehensive mode of reasoning which\r\nstruck at the very foundation of all authority of mayor or commonalty;\r\nfor that, he said, the town had no power whatever to collect, since\r\nExeter had neither mayor nor bailiffs nor any fee-ferm at all till the\r\ntime of Henry the Third, and even then the grant was illegally made by\r\nRichard of Almayne, who really possessed no rights in the borough.[667]\r\nFor the taxes connected with municipal expenses, or as the mayor called\r\nthem, the “citizens’ spending,” he asserted that his tenants were\r\nnot legally responsible. In any case he differed altogether from the\r\ncitizens in his definition of the “ancient custom” by which the payment\r\nof the taxes should be regulated,[668] and complained that his tenants\r\nhad not been duly summoned to take part in the assessment, and “of\r\nmalice” had been charged in their absence “an importable sum ... so\r\nthat there would have remained in the mayor’s hands a great sum thereof\r\nabove the said dime,” like as there had remained in other mayors’ hands\r\nas much as £7 or £5, sometimes more or less.[669]\r\n\r\n(5) In one of the most burdensome duties of town life, the keeping of\r\nwatch and ward, the dependents of St. Peter’s fee had sought to throw\r\nthe whole labour on the citizens.[670] The bishop’s tenants when they\r\nwere summoned “to come and keep the watch and the peace came not ...\r\nbut they were forbode upon a great pain, and charged if any of the\r\nmayor’s officers entered into any tenement of the bishop for to warn\r\nany man to come to the watch, that they should break his head.”[671]\r\nThe bishop in fact had ordered that a fine of 40_s._—a fine quite\r\nbeyond the power of an ordinary tradesman to pay—should be levied from\r\nany one who dared to serve on the watch. “Whereupon the mayor made\r\nright great wayward language to them. The mayor said waywardly he would\r\ndo more, he would make levy both of the citizens’ spending and the\r\nfee-farm, and that he would well avow, and bade them of all to inform\r\nthe Justice thereof, and that he would do the same; and so the mayor\r\ndid.”[672]\r\n\r\n(6) “The most disclaunderous article” of all, according to the bishop,\r\nwas the question of the assize of wine, ale, and bread. While the mayor\r\nclaimed the assize over the bishop’s demesne, the bishop asserted that\r\nsuch assize “of time that no mind is” belonged wholly to the bishop\r\nhimself, and in no wise to the mayor.[673] This matter was partly a\r\nquestion of finance, and partly a question of order. So long as wine\r\nwas first smuggled in by the bishop’s tenants, and then sold in the\r\nhouses of the canons and in the precincts, against “the ordinances and\r\ncry” made by the mayor, the town lost the customs which ought to be\r\npaid at the port of Exmouth on every pipe of wine; and as the ferm was\r\npaid out of these customs, the bishop’s tenants escaped their share of\r\nthe rent,[674] and left the whole burden to be borne by the citizens.\r\nThe corporation further lost the “wine gavell” paid on all wine sold\r\nby retail in the town. Moreover fraudulent sellers went unpunished;\r\nfor instead of allowing the town officers to cast into the canal wine\r\nwhich was condemned by the municipality as “corrupt and not whole for\r\nman’s body, damnable and which should be damned,” the bishop’s tenants\r\nactually found means to gather from it profits of iniquity; “the which\r\ncorrupt wine hath been carried to Topsham and there shipped, and so led\r\nto Bordeaux, there to be put and melled among new wine, as it shall\r\nbe well proved if need be.” In the same way the weighing of bread was\r\nresisted, and the due testing of beer, and the authority of the city\r\nset at nought.\r\n\r\n(7) There was also a quarrel about who was to get the profits from\r\nincreased rents of stalls and shops and houses which opened on the\r\nmarket-place,[675] and whose value altogether depended on the growth\r\nof the market and the town trade. Both the municipality and the church\r\nwould willingly have seized the “unearned increment.” The convent\r\nhad set up stalls and booths “on the ground of the said mayor and\r\ncitizens without licence of them asked”—great stalls sixty feet long\r\nand over three feet broad, where of old time there had only been shop\r\nwindows, “the leaves thereof going inward, and none other never were.”\r\nThe bishop answered that any one in the town might put stalls outside\r\nhis own house if he chose; and in any case, he added, with consistent\r\ndenial of the authority of the corporation, it was a matter to be\r\npunished by the King, if at all, and not by the commonalty. When the\r\ntownsmen further urged that they had always “of time that no mind is”\r\nheld their fish-market in Fish Street, a sort of debateable land, which\r\nlay outside the cemetery but within the precincts of the close, but\r\nthat now the dean and chapter had refused to let the market be held\r\nthere, and had themselves made stairs and gardens encroaching on the\r\nstreet, which moreover cut off the mayor’s way to the town walls and\r\ntowers, the bishop answered in quibbling wise that as there never was\r\nsuch a street as Fish Street, no market could well be held in it, nor\r\ncould it be encroached upon: what the town chose to call Fish Street,\r\nthe prelate explained, was in his nomenclature S. Martin’s or the\r\nCanon’s Street.[676]\r\n\r\n(8) As in other fortified towns, where the wall of the ecclesiastical\r\nprecincts ran side by side with the city wall,[677] endless questions\r\nwere raised as to the management and repair of walls and towers, and\r\nthe control of the city gates, and the use of the narrow way that ran\r\ninside the wall for the movement of troops, the carriage of ammunition,\r\nand the approach of the city authorities, or of workmen—questions\r\nwhich in time of war or of civil revolt were of vital consequence, and\r\nwhich even in quiet days brought frequent trouble. Each side claimed\r\nthe lane, and the mayor and corporation objected to the canons who,\r\nhaving back doors opening from the gardens into it, had made it into\r\na mere rubbish heap, so “that no man therein may well ride nor go\r\nnor lead carriage to the walls, to the great hurt and hindering of\r\nthe mayor and commonalty;” and who had further broken up the great\r\ndrain which had been made to draw off rain water from the town and\r\nhad carried away the stones. Moreover the commonalty had spent £20\r\non building a great tower “and right a strong door with lock and key\r\nmade thereto and fast shut, to this intent there to bring in stuff\r\nfor the war and defence of the city and other thing more of the said\r\ncity there to be kept strong, safe, and sure; but whenever this lock,\r\nand those of various postern doors, were repaired “they have been\r\nright spitefully broke up by the bishop, and dean and chapter,” and\r\nthe door of the tower left at all times open so that the canons could\r\nthrow their rubbish into it. And finally, the canons having fitted one\r\nof the town gates with a new lock and key of their own, by night and\r\nday “full ungodly carriage have been led in and out.” “At which gate\r\nalso ofttime have been great affrays and debate, and like to have been\r\nmanslaughter, and divers night-walkers and rioters coming out at that\r\ngate into the city, and there have made many affrays, assaults, and\r\nother riotous misgovernance against the peace, and broken out over the\r\ntown walls, and much more mischief like to fall by that gate without\r\nbetter remedy had.” To all these charges the canons answered that the\r\nlane was their own property, nor had they ever broken any gutter there\r\nnor thrown rubbish out; and as to the wall it was the commonalty which\r\n“by their frowardness to evil intent,” had let it fall down and had not\r\nrepaired it “in any time this hundred year;” while the towers stood on\r\necclesiastical ground, “and the bishop sometime had his prison in that\r\ntower.”[678]\r\n\r\n(9) The common use of the cathedral became a further subject of\r\nwrangling, as the corporation pressed for sole authority within the\r\ntower inclosure and the ecclesiastical party retorted by stricter\r\nprotection of its own peculiar property. It had been the custom at\r\nfair-time to set up booths in the cemetery and even within the church;\r\nbut the dean and chapter now began to demand tolls, especially from\r\nthe jewellers’ stalls. This the town angrily resented, and the matter\r\nwas referred to arbitrators, who decided that the chapter had no right\r\nto any such tolls within church or cemetery, “for anger and evil will\r\nwhereof the said dean and chapter by their ministers and servants,\r\never since have put out all such merchants and merchandize contrary\r\nand against the old rule and use, and to the destruction of the fairs\r\nand markets.”[679] Moreover the canons proceeded to lock the doors of\r\na cloister adjoining the church which was according to the citizens\r\n“a common way for the mayor and commonalty” into the cathedral, and\r\n“a place of prayer and devotion to pray for all souls whose bones lay\r\nburied there.” It was in no sense, said the ecclesiastics, a “common\r\nway” of the townspeople; it was walled and glazed and had a chapter\r\nhouse and library, and the canons were much offended that “ungodly\r\nruled people, most custumably young people of the said commonalty\r\nwithin the said cloister have exercised unlawful games as the top,\r\n‘queke,’ ‘penny prykke,’ and most at tennis, by the which the walls\r\nof the said cloister have been defouled and the glass windows all to\r\nbrost, as it openly sheweth, contrary to all good and ghostly goodness,\r\nand directly against all good policy, and against all good rule within\r\nthe said cloister to suffer any such misruled people to have common\r\nentry.” The mayor still asserted however that “within time out of\r\nmind there was no such cloister there but all open church here, and\r\na common way into the said church.” As to the games, “the mayor,\r\nbailiffs, and commonalty say that they by the law be not bound thereto\r\nto answer.”[680]\r\n\r\nAmid the endless and vulgar details of all this intricate quarrel,\r\nShillingford held fast to the principles which he saw plainly were\r\nof the very essence of any true municipal life. Charters of freedom\r\nwere of no use if in every question of trade, of police, of finance,\r\nof public order, ecclesiastical privilege stepped in and brought all\r\ngovernment save its own to an end. All discussions from first to\r\nlast invariably came back to the one central problem—the right of\r\narrest—and here the mayor was determined that no persuasion should\r\ninduce him to abate one jot of the city claims. He would give no assent\r\nto the bishop’s arguments drawn from an alleged friendly agreement\r\nwhich laid down that the town officers should make arrests in the\r\ncemetery only, and that they might not arrest there the canons or\r\nmen wearing the religious habit or their ministers and servants, and\r\nsteadfastly denied that any such writing had ever been known or proved.\r\nHenceforth he would not hear of concession or compromise; “it would\r\nseem if I so did that I had doubt of our right where I have right\r\nnone,”[681] as he said to the lord chief justice. When “my lord himself\r\nspake darkly of right old charters,” and conjured him to make an end\r\nof the matter, “and if I so did I should be chronicled;” the mayor\r\nstill remained firm.[682] “I held my own, I had matter enough.” He was\r\nespecially pressed in sundry points by the lord chancellor, who as a\r\nlearned man made merry over the tale of Vespasian’s connexion with the\r\ncity, a piece of history upon which the mayor did not greatly care to\r\ndwell;[683] and as former canon of Exeter cathedral he was ready at\r\ntimes to laugh over the stories of his Exeter days, and of the exciting\r\narrests and lively disputes which he so well remembered; “all it was\r\nto tempt me with laughing cheer,” said the watchful mayor.[684] “At\r\nthe last fell to matter of sadness, and they spake of God’s house, St.\r\nPeter’s Church of Exeter, and my lord spake of his house, his hall, and\r\nthe justice the same, how loath they would be to make arrests therein,\r\nand said that St. Peter’s Church was God’s house and His hall, &c.,\r\nand made many reasons to bring in absence of arrests.[685] They were\r\nanswered as God would give us grace.” The chancellor, as was natural\r\nfrom his old association with the chapter, was especially anxious to\r\nbring about a compromise favourable to the church. He proposed that\r\nthe city should have the view of frankpledge over the whole city and\r\nprecincts, and should only make arrests ordered by that court; and on\r\nthe other hand the bishop “to have his courts of his own tenants and\r\nto hold pleas of greater sum than the court baron, forty shillings,\r\nand spake of forty marks. Upon this mean he sticked fast and thought\r\nit was reasonable, and ever asked of me divers times what I would say\r\nthereto, all as I conceived to tempt me, and to consent to a mean;\r\nand then I said, my lord, if it please you, ye shall have me excused\r\nto answer, for though methought that it were a mean reasonable I dare\r\nnot say yea, though I have power, for the matter toucheth a great\r\ncommonalty as well as me, and so that I dare not say unto time that I\r\nhave spoke with my fellowship at home.”[686]\r\n\r\nFor two years the discussions dragged on at one place or another,\r\ntill in 1448 an agreement was made between Town and Church “by mean\r\nand mediation of Thomas Courtney, Earl of Devonshire, and of Sir\r\nWilliam Bonville, knight,” and was four days later (Dec. 16th, 1448)\r\nconfirmed by the Chief Justice of Common Pleas and another Judge.\r\nExeter was forgiven the enormous damages demanded by the convent for\r\nthe illegal arrests made by the town officers within the precincts two\r\nyears before—damages amounting to £1,000, or a sum which must have\r\nbeen equal to many years’ revenue of the borough. For the rest the\r\narbitration reasserted in definite terms the division of authority\r\nagainst which the city had so vigorously protested. The bishop was left\r\nabsolute lord of his fee. All he desired—court baron, leet, view of\r\nfrankpledge, a rule without any disturbance of the mayor, bailiffs,\r\nor coroners of the city, and with absolute freedom from distress or\r\narrest, was secured to him for ever. He was only bound not to arrest\r\nany of the mayor’s subjects in his precincts. As for the mayor and\r\ncommonalty they retained their ancient powers in the city, but might\r\nmake no arrests on church lands. They might summon the bishop’s tenants\r\nto keep the watch in their turn, and might fine them if they refused,\r\nmaking a levy on their goods found _without the Fee_. In the king’s\r\ntaxes and the city murage the church tenants were to take their share,\r\nbut it was to be raised by their own officers. Lastly the mayor and\r\nbailiffs might have their maces carried before them in the cathedral\r\nprecincts without disturbance.[687] It was decreed that no new charters\r\nwere to disturb this arrangement;[688] and hence forward the chapter\r\nguarded its privileges with accurate solicitude.[689]\r\n\r\nThis “final” settlement gave to the city all that any lawyer could\r\nhave given it in the fifteenth century, for lawyers after all could\r\nonly declare the legal principles that had been laid down in times\r\nwhen the power in the State had been very differently balanced, and\r\nthe fashioning of the law in these matters had lain in the hands of\r\necclesiastics. Statesmen like the chancellor moreover could discuss the\r\nquestion with philosophic calm; in the greater concerns of national\r\nadministration the problem between Church and State had been decided\r\nfor them in the days of Henry the Second, by methods as rough and ready\r\nas any which burghers of later times had attempted; and they therefore\r\nnow looked at the townspeople’s troubles from afar off. The pressure\r\nof difficulty had changed, and whereas it was the people who had once\r\ngained profit from ecclesiastical immunities, while kings and statesmen\r\nhad to bear the violence of the battle for order and the authority\r\nof government, now the brunt of the fight fell on the common folk,\r\nwhile rulers at Westminster sat at ease and calmly recounted the old\r\narguments which their greater predecessors had found it necessary to\r\nrepudiate utterly three hundred years before.\r\n\r\nFor the experience of Exeter was by no means exceptional or rare, and\r\nif we turn to the history of Canterbury or Norwich we find the same\r\nrecord of centuries of passionate strife, with fire and pillage and\r\nmurder and costly processes of law ending in yet fiercer antagonism. To\r\nmultiply instances would prove wearisome repetition, but considering\r\nthe great importance which these questions had for the mediæval\r\nburgher, and the gravity of their results in later history, it may be\r\nwell to note in the history of another town how, with a few superficial\r\ndifferences, the fundamental difficulty was always the same.\r\n\r\nIn Canterbury, as we might expect, things were yet more complicated\r\nthan in Exeter, and the situation of the citizens was one of\r\nconsiderable perplexity. From almost every considerable holding in the\r\ntown some religious corporation claimed a rent charge which had to\r\nbe deducted in the city accounts. The Convent of S. Gregory declared\r\nitself to be in the shire of Kent and outside the city bounds, and as\r\nlate as 1515 asserted its freedom by refusing to take its share in the\r\npayment of a subsidy; when the mayor levied a distress the convent sued\r\nhim for trespass, and a long and costly lawsuit followed.[690] The\r\nhospitals of S. Nicholas at Harbledown and of S. John Northgate were\r\nexempted by royal charter from all tallages, aids, and contributions;\r\nand their lands and woods in the hundred of Westgate were made free\r\nfrom contribution for the defence of the coast.[691] But these trifling\r\ngrievances scarcely came into notice beside the troubles caused by\r\ngreater ecclesiastical powers—the Priory of Christ Church, the Convent\r\nof S. Augustine’s, and the Archbishop. The old dissensions that had\r\nonce disturbed their common harmony had all been appeased by means of\r\na complete separation between the property and jurisdiction of the\r\nArchbishop and the Convent of Christ Church, which had been finally\r\narranged somewhere about 1260; and by an agreement which was concluded\r\nabout the end of the fourteenth century, between S. Augustine’s and\r\nChrist Church, as to their special disputes about ecclesiastical\r\nprerogatives, or about the rights of the convents on the high sea,\r\non the quay at Fordwich, in the common meadows at Sturry, and in the\r\nneighbouring harbours of Sandwich which belonged to Christ Church,\r\nand Stonor which belonged to S. Augustine’s.[692] But in the general\r\npeacemaking the city was left out, and the city had its own separate\r\ngrievances against archbishop, abbot, and prior.\r\n\r\nI. For the archbishop possessed certain rights which were exceedingly\r\ninconvenient to the borough. In case of a quarrel, he could refuse\r\nto ordain Canterbury men, to confirm Canterbury children, or to\r\nallow the offices of the Church to sick people, unless the townsfolk\r\nswore to obey him in all things. He could forbid his tenants to join\r\nin the great city festival of the Translation of S. Thomas. He was\r\nknown to have cited 140 of the chief citizens to appear before him\r\nat Charing, twelve leagues away from Canterbury and without proper\r\nvictuals, whereas by custom they should be summoned to appear in their\r\nown cathedral. Such were the complaints which the struggling town had\r\nto make in 1290.[693] His borough of Staplegate, just opposite the\r\npalace and within the city boundaries, was surrounded by a wall and\r\nexempt from the jurisdiction of both the city and the county;[694]\r\neven the royal writ did not run in it. Since his tenants in Westgate\r\nand Wingham were free from the town authorities, when Westgate men\r\ntook to building their houses so near the river that the stream was\r\ndriven against the city walls with such force as to make them fall,\r\nthe town was helpless to check the evil, and complained as loudly of\r\nthe wrong in 1467[695] as it had done in 1290. Or when Wingham men\r\nintercepted for their market the provisions which were on the road to\r\nCanterbury, and thus both diminished the tolls of provisions taken at\r\nthe Canterbury gates and increased the price of food, the corporation\r\nhad no remedy, for the archbishop’s right to hold a market at Wingham\r\ncould not be denied.[696] Moreover the Whitstaple fishermen, also\r\ntenants of the archbishop, were supported by him in 1431 in their\r\nclaim of a right to sell fish in the city free from any toll save a\r\nfarthing for each person; and in 1481 when the fishwives refused to pay\r\ntoll or to sell in a new market built by the citizens, the townsfolk\r\nhad no resource save to make up out of their own pockets the losses\r\nof the tax collector during these troubles.[697] We have the record\r\nof yet another quarrel in 1480, when the archbishop seized the tithe\r\nof the aftermath in the King’s Mead, upon which the mayor immediately\r\ncollected his posse, marched to the meadow about a mile distant, and\r\nthere ordered sixteen pennyworth of wine to be served out all round for\r\nthe refreshment of his troop.[698]\r\n\r\nII. With the Abbot of S. Augustine’s the city had disputes concerning\r\nmill and market. For the “Abbot’s Mill” was supposed to injure the City\r\nMill, which lay a little higher up the stream, and the grievance was\r\nso serious that in 1415 iron-topped stakes were driven into the river\r\nbed by a board of inspectors to mark the highest level for the water\r\nat the Abbot’s Mill, so that the fall might be deep enough for water\r\ncoming from the wheel of the City Mill.[699] As late as 1522 there was\r\na consultation between the town body and “Milord of S. Austin’s” about\r\nthe fish-market, which ended in a friendly manner with the present of a\r\nconger-eel and a bottle of Malmsey to the abbot.\r\n\r\nThe chief quarrel however was as to the exact limits of the abbot’s\r\nauthority as defined by an agreement drawn up in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and carefully copied out anew by the city clerk in the\r\nfifteenth century; and the nice point under discussion during many\r\ngenerations was whether the abbots, under pretext of infang-theoff,\r\nshould persist in arresting evildoers in Longport, which was the King’s\r\nhighway and under the jurisdiction of his assignees, the corporation\r\nof Canterbury, but which ran for its whole length through the abbey\r\nlands.[700] It was only after 1475 that the dispute seems to have\r\ncome to an end, when the abbot’s gallows at Chaldensham were, by the\r\nconsent of the community and of the convent, broken to pieces. A\r\nBaron of the Exchequer and the Recorder of London chosen to arbitrate\r\nbetween the burghers and the monks, were welcomed at Canterbury with\r\na fee for their pains, lodged at the Austin Friars, entertained\r\nsumptuously at the town’s expense with lavish supplies of choice food\r\nand drink,[701] and served with three meals a day, “fractio jejunii,\r\njantaculum, et cœna,” till finally on a certain afternoon the monks and\r\nthe corporation met to drink together in honour of the final peace,\r\nand the ambassadors set out on their journey homewards, treated to\r\nrefreshments at every stage from the parting cup at Canterbury to the\r\nfarewell drink at Newgate. In 1478 they delivered their arbitration at\r\nWestminster, and there was a fresh series of “potationes” to celebrate\r\nthe settlement.[702]\r\n\r\nIII. The Abbot of S. Augustine’s was indeed a far less formidable\r\nneighbour than the Prior of Christ Church, between whom and the city\r\nthere lay centuries of angry controversy. With him also there was of\r\ncourse the usual quarrel about the administration of justice. The\r\nPrior had his own gallows, where men were hung for sheep-stealing\r\nas well as for murder, and when the see of Canterbury was vacant\r\nconvicted prisoners who “pleaded their clergy” were handed over to\r\nhim as their ordinary—an arrangement which evidently must have been\r\na source of much bitter feeling on the part of the townspeople; in\r\n1313, for example, out of nine men who were convicted by a jury in the\r\nAssize court of stealing and murder and who all pleaded their clergy,\r\nseven purged themselves before the ecclesiastical judge and were set\r\nfree.[703] Moreover the cathedral was turned into a sanctuary, where\r\ncriminals fled from the just judgment of their fellow citizens. In\r\n1425 Bernard the goldsmith, a stranger from over sea, escaped from the\r\ncity prison and fled to the cathedral church, followed by the bailiffs\r\nand a wild mob of townsmen. As he crouched within the rails of the new\r\nmonument put up to Archbishop Chicheley, the mob thrust their arms\r\nbetween the bars, seized him and beat him with sticks hidden in their\r\nsleeves, and at last tore him out of the enclosure, carried him into\r\nthe nave, and would have dragged him back to gaol, save for the sudden\r\ninterference of the commissary, who with his followers drove them back\r\nand rescued the prisoner from their hands.[704]\r\n\r\nSo also the question of taxes caused much wrangling. Christ Church,\r\nwhich owned within the franchise £200 of rent and five acres of\r\nland,[705] claimed to be free from any contribution for maintaining\r\nthe walls of the city[706] after their circuit had been completed by\r\nArchbishop Sudbury and left to the people’s care; and this dispute was\r\nnot settled till 1492, when the convent, having got possession of a\r\npart of the wall, undertook to keep that section of it in repair.[707]\r\nWith regard to the costs of levying soldiers for the royal service[708]\r\nthe citizens decided in 1327 to charge a part of this tax on lands\r\nheld by the convent. The tax seems to have been required only from\r\nproperty in the city, and the archbishop was inclined to give way after\r\ndiscussion with his counsel, “however much those of our Church may wish\r\nto do otherwise,” but the prior resolutely held out and got a letter\r\nof special protection from the King for Church property.[709] At this\r\nthe city was stirred to the utmost fury. The people held a meeting in\r\nBlackfriars’ churchyard, and passed a resolution that if the convent\r\nstill refused they would break their windows in Burgate, disable their\r\nmills, drive their tenants out of their houses; that they would allow\r\nno one to give, sell, or lend meat or drink to monks, and would seize\r\ncarts and horses carrying food from their manors and sell them in the\r\nmarket; that they would arrest any monk coming out of the monastery\r\ninto the city and take his clothes and property; that the monastery\r\nshould be cut off from the world by a deep trench dug in front of its\r\ngate, and that no pilgrim should be allowed to enter the cathedral\r\nuntil he had taken an oath not to make the smallest offering. Finally\r\nevery man at the meeting swore that he would have from S. Thomas’s\r\nshrine a gold ring for a finger of each hand.[710] The threat of\r\ninterference with their pilgrims was a serious matter to the convent,\r\nsince the whole charge of providing for the comfort and safety of the\r\npilgrims lay with the mayor. Not only was it his office to see that\r\nsufficient food was laid up in the city for the pilgrims and to have\r\nall the special directions which he judged necessary for their victuals\r\nand lodgings set forth on a post which stood before the court hall,\r\nbut he was further responsible for keeping order among them, and there\r\nwere occasions when travellers would set out on their journey with just\r\napprehension unless, as happened at Lydd, official messengers from the\r\ntown were sent before to Canterbury to arrange that its pilgrims might\r\ncome and go in safety without danger of arrest, and won favour of the\r\nmayor’s wife by the gift of a quart of malmsey.[711] The corporation\r\nhad in fact power to make a visit to the shrine so difficult and\r\nunpleasant as seriously to affect the flow of offering to the treasury\r\nof the saint, and this at a time when the anxiety of the convent about\r\nprofits was heightened by the pressing demands of the Papal Court\r\nfor a share in the spoils of its great Jubilee festivals.[712] Money\r\nquarrels in fact never failed on either side, and at the very end of\r\nthe fifteenth century it would seem that Cardinal Morton saw in the\r\nold feuds a chance for making Canterbury pay its full tribute to the\r\nroyal treasury; when in 1494 he issued demands for aid in money or in\r\nmen for the Scotch war he seems to have sent several blank copies of\r\nthe summons to his friend Prior Selling to be filled up by him and\r\nissued to corporations and citizens whom he thought rich enough to pay.\r\nProbably in his directions to the tax-gatherer Prior Selling did not\r\nforget old enemies of the convent.[713]\r\n\r\nThe quarrel as to the town market also lasted on throughout the\r\nfifteenth century. There the city magistrates had indeed undisputed\r\ncontrol, but it was not always easy to enforce their control on the\r\nclever people of the convent. Sometimes the monks attempted to escape\r\nfrom the regulations and tolls of the burgesses by sending to buy their\r\nfish at the seaside; and the townsmen protected themselves by seizing\r\nany fish so bought on its way to the priory.[714] Other questions\r\narose as to houses belonging to Christ Church which opened inwards on\r\nthe precincts but had windows looking outwards on the market-place in\r\nBurgate just outside the priory gate, from which houses shutters and\r\nwindows could be let down for the inhabitants to display their wares\r\non market-day, whereat the town was doubly aggrieved both by losing\r\nthe rent of stalls and by seeing the increasing rent of the houses\r\npass away into the convent treasury. At last in 1493 convent and city\r\nsought to make a final settlement of the question. The boundaries of\r\nthe monastery were defined, including many houses of laymen, and within\r\nthese limits the town renounced all jurisdiction except over houses\r\nand shops which had doors or windows opening on the street; while the\r\nconvent was allowed to distrain on any houses that belonged to it in\r\nthe city. But in 1500 the quarrel broke out with intenser bitterness,\r\nand the mayor violently shifted the market from the prior’s gate to the\r\nopen space near the city church, so that no house held by the convent\r\nshould have the advantage of opening out upon it. Then ecclesiastical\r\ntenants refused to sell in the new market, and city stall-holders\r\ntreated the convent servants with little courtesy. The citizens fell\r\non the caterer of Christ Church as he was carrying a halibut he had\r\nbought from the market to the priory gate, and took it from him,\r\n“contrary to all right and good conscience;” and when the prior sent\r\nto the seaside for fish, it was seized at the entrance of the town by\r\nthe citizens, “disappointing in the same the brethren of the place\r\nof their dinners.”[715] The prior brought his grievances before the\r\nLondon courts, upon which the whole town took up the question with\r\nardour, and the burgesses collected a voluntary subscription to defend\r\ntheir cause. The mayor was charged with the conduct of the suit in\r\nLondon. Ten or twelve citizens were perpetually riding backwards and\r\nforwards and hanging about the courts, and the usual expenses entered\r\nin the town records for drink, supper, horse-meat, hire of horses to\r\nRochester and hire of barges and cloaks for the travellers from thence\r\nto London, down to “threepence paid at Sittingbourne in washing of my\r\nshirts.”[716] Master Poynings, being at last commissioned by the King\r\nto take evidence on the spot, was entertained at a splendid banquet,\r\nand finally an exemplification of the market was sent up to the King’s\r\nCouncil in London. In 1501 a new messenger from the King “came to\r\nthe city and tarried not because of death,[717] but spake with Mr.\r\nMayor at S. Andrew’s Church, the which showed him the market and so\r\nhe departed to Dover,” followed by a messenger of the mayor hurrying\r\nafter him with presents of fish, game, poultry, and wine. Then new\r\nambassadors were sent from the city to the King at Richmond, and the\r\npaying of fees, and costs for eating and drinking went on merrily. But\r\nthe citizens won the day in the end, for the Canterbury market is still\r\nheld by S. Andrew’s Church and was never brought back to the priory\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nEven the control of the river brought its troubles, for whenever a\r\nquestion arose as to embanking and straightening the bed of the stream,\r\nthe prior and the mayor met in the meadows about Chatham with their\r\nfollowers and carried on consultations refreshed by the usual supply\r\nof meat and drink. Business however was done at these parties, and the\r\nriver turned from its meandering course from one side of the valley to\r\nthe other into the straight channel in which it now flows.[718] The\r\nquestion of the mills was less easy to settle, with the dependent\r\nproblems as to damming the water and dredging the shallows. A\r\nsettlement made in 1431 to prevent the injury of the city mill failed\r\nto end disputes, and in 1499 the prior dug a trench which drew away\r\nthe water from it, upon which the citizens destroyed the trench and\r\nproceeded to make a dam for the conservation of the water running to\r\ntheir mill. The prior in his turn cut the dam; whereupon the mayor\r\ncalled out his posse to fight the matter out in the meadows by the\r\nriver, apparently routed the enemy’s forces, seizing their arms, and\r\nthe next day in his wrath removed the market to its new place, as we\r\nhave seen.[719]\r\n\r\nSo ended the fifteenth century in Canterbury amid a storm of invective\r\nand free fighting. The mayor protested that the prior, in addition to\r\nall his other crimes, had taken away the mace from the city serjeant,\r\nand had allowed the city ditch to be befouled. The prior retorted by\r\naccusing the mayor of riotous conduct, and breaking of boundaries and\r\nbuilding of bridges and diverting of water-courses to his damage, and\r\nnot only this, but of having for malice and grudge to the prior and\r\nconvent broken the old custom of the citizens’ gathering at Christmas\r\nat the tomb of Sudbury to pray for his soul for the great acts he had\r\ndone for the city, so that they now withdrew their prayers from thence\r\nto hold their service under the prison house called Westgate. Indeed\r\nthey even refused to join the noblemen who brought the King’s offering\r\nto S. Thomas at the Christmastide feast.\r\n\r\nAs usual, however, all this mighty turmoil ended in nothing. The mayor\r\nwas indicted by the convent for riot, and the verdict of the jury went\r\nagainst him, but no particular result seems to have followed; and\r\nthough the persevering prior then had the case brought before the Star\r\nChamber in 1501, it was passed over for want of leisure.[720]\r\n\r\nPractically the same story was repeated at Canterbury as at Exeter\r\nand in every other city where there was a similar conflict.[721]\r\nMoney and skill and labour and passion were expended without measure,\r\nand finally the courts adjudged that all must remain as it had been\r\nwhen the municipality scarcely existed three hundred years before,\r\nan order which statesmen possibly thought the safest course in the\r\npresence of opposing forces, neither of whom was strong enough to win,\r\nand neither of whom could dare to lose. But this was not the end of\r\nthe matter. Through these three hundred years the towns had gathered\r\nstrength, perfected their machinery of government, and realized their\r\nown might. Wealthy, highly organized, very centres of rationalism in\r\npolitics and common sense in business, their controversy with the\r\nChurch, singularly free as it was from theological pre-occupation,\r\nwas inevitably in all questions of temporal government more keen and\r\nresolute in the fifteenth century than ever before. It was vain to\r\nrenew attempts in one town after another to appease irreconcilable\r\nquarrels by arbitrations and compromises which left the real problem\r\nuntouched, and the century before the Reformation was everywhere a time\r\nof restless dissatisfaction, and of spasmodic revolts against the alien\r\necclesiastical settlements which throve on the town’s wealth, and could\r\nnever be absorbed into the town’s life. For a little space matters\r\nhung in the balance, and then came the crash of the Reformation. In\r\nthe bitterness of feeling that grew out of the long struggle of the\r\nburghers, we have a measure of that temper of virile independence which\r\ncreated the boroughs of the Middle Ages; and as we stand now under\r\nthe walls of Canterbury Cathedral and see its glory shattered and\r\nits carved work broken in pieces, we may well wonder whether in that\r\ngreat ruin there was no other motive at work than the fanaticism of a\r\nreligious awakening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCONFEDERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE fact that the English burghers took so impatiently the one\r\nhindrance that lay in their path to independence and supremacy is\r\nitself a proof of the habit of prosperity and success which they\r\nwere accustomed to accept as part of their natural heritage in the\r\npleasant place where their lot had fallen. How little they had at\r\nany time to reckon with opposition is obvious from the striking fact\r\nthat they never found themselves compelled to form any kind of union\r\nor alliance for common purposes. Here the story of English boroughs\r\nis in vivid contrast to that of the continental towns. The powerful\r\nconfederations formed in European countries by towns battling against\r\ntremendous odds to protect their commerce, liberty, and law, had no\r\nparallel among the comparatively peaceful and regular conditions of\r\nEnglish life, where self-government was so easily attained, and where\r\ntrade was so generally secure, that the necessity never arose for the\r\ncreation of any such associations. Towns on the royal demesne stood\r\nin no need of any combined effort to defend their freedom; and the\r\ntowns on ecclesiastical lands or feudal estates that had grievances\r\nto complain of were few, scattered, and subject to so many different\r\nlords that combination among them would have been wholly impossible.\r\nOrganized common action was therefore practically unknown among the\r\nEnglish boroughs; for the loose tie of affiliation which bound together\r\ncommunities of which one had adopted the charter and copied the customs\r\nof another was a bond so slight as to be scarcely recognized,[722] and\r\nimplied no mutual obligations whatever. In moments of excited strife or\r\nrapid constitutional growth a borough might undoubtedly become fired by\r\nthe example of a near neighbour, or catch the contagion which spread\r\nfrom some community more advanced in its experiments and daring in its\r\npretensions; but these movements of sympathy, of voluntary affiliation,\r\nof emulation, never resulted in any kind of federation or alliance.\r\nFor the developement of its liberties each borough was ultimately left\r\nto depend only on its own resources; while such societies as were\r\nconstituted in later days in England for trading purposes took the form\r\nof federations of men not of towns.[723]\r\n\r\nThere was but one exception to this general rule, and in the\r\nConfederation of the Cinque Ports we have the single illustration in\r\nEngland of an association of towns created and maintained for common\r\ninterests. From Seaford in Sussex to Brightlingsea in Essex ports and\r\nvillages were bound together into one society. To the original group\r\nof the Five Ports—Hastings, Sandwich, Dover, Romney, and Hythe, whose\r\nalliance probably reaches back to the time when the English learned war\r\nand commerce from Danish masters—the two Ancient Towns, Winchelsea and\r\nRye, had been added immediately after the Norman Conquest; and what\r\nwith the desire of these seven to divide their burdens of taxation and\r\nwar charges with the neighbouring villages, and the readiness of the\r\nvillages on their side to seek admission to the Port privileges,[724]\r\nan association had in course of time been evolved consisting of\r\nseven head Ports with eight corporate and twenty-four non-corporate\r\nmembers,[725] all gathered under the rule of the Lord Warden. To the\r\nlast they bore traces of foreign influences in the name of Jurats by\r\nwhich they called their “portmen,” and of Barons which they gave to\r\ntheir “freemen.” But amid the curious vicissitudes of their history,\r\nand the odd incidents of their ownership in times when it seemed\r\nnatural and simple to grant away the very frontier defences of England\r\nto Norman counts and Breton dukes and abbots of Fécamp and monks of\r\nCanterbury,[726] and in later days after English kings had realised the\r\nadvantages of themselves owning the main gates by which their country\r\nopened on the European world,[727] these communities remained firmly\r\nunited under their federal government.[728] The King’s writ did not\r\nrun in the Ports unless it bore the seal of the Lord Warden. Exempt\r\nby charter from serving on juries, assizes, or recognizances outside\r\ntheir own territory,[729] the freemen could be impleaded only in their\r\nown courts.[730] No prisoner from the Ports could be summoned by the\r\nJudges to Westminster, and in the case of an express order from the\r\nKing “some demur should be made to the first mandate till it be known\r\nwith certainty it is his pleasure,”[731] while on the other hand any\r\nstranger who committed a crime within their liberties might be claimed\r\nby the mayor and jurats from any lordship in the realm, even from\r\nthe King himself.[732] They had even, after a fight which lasted for\r\ngenerations, successfully resisted all attempts to bring their local\r\njurisdiction within the general judicial system of the kingdom, and\r\nthe Justices Itinerant were shut out from crossing their boundaries\r\nor sitting at their Court of Shepway.[733] Ancient privileges were\r\njealously guarded. “New Acts of Parliament,” they said, “ought not\r\nto alter the free customs.”[734] No deodand was given to the Crown\r\n“because it never was the custom here.”[735] If an ecclesiastical\r\nofficer came from Canterbury to make an inventory of the goods of\r\na Sandwich man who had died without a will, he was not allowed to\r\nact because it was contrary to the ancient customs and liberties of\r\nthe town.[736] Their corporate dignity was officially recognized on\r\ngreat occasions of State, such as the coronation of a King or the\r\nconsecration of an Archbishop, when the envoys of the Cinque Ports were\r\ntreated with special honour and sat at the right hand table in the\r\nhall; and each of the Ports in turn sent representatives to carry the\r\ncanopy over the newly-crowned King, and after the ceremony to bear it\r\nback with its silk hangings, its spears, and its silver bells, as the\r\ntown’s spoils.[737]\r\n\r\nAs to the idea or principle which held this society of towns together\r\nand the purpose which it was meant to serve, the definition given by\r\na minister of the Crown would probably have been very different from\r\nthat given by a baron of the Ports. To a statesman the confederation of\r\nthe Cinque Ports was organized in the interests of the whole country,\r\nand maintained as the bulwark of national safety; and the policy of\r\nWest Saxon rulers, of Danish conquerors, of Norman kings, of Angevin\r\nstatesmen, had all alike aimed at the increasing of its public utility.\r\nHolding their posts in the first line of defence against invasion, the\r\nCinque Port towns were bound to keep a sufficient number of men within\r\ntheir walls for defence against the enemy, and watch that inhabitants\r\nwere not driven away by the imposition of undue local taxes; they\r\nhad to bear heavy costs for ordnance, ammunition, fortifications; to\r\nset a nightly watch in every borough and at every dangerous creek or\r\nharbour; to have armed forces ready to meet the first brunt of attack,\r\nwhile their citizens might expect in time of war to see their houses\r\nsacked and burned again and again. They had to provide every year\r\nfifty-seven ships and 1,197 men with provisions for the defence of the\r\nkingdom,[738] and if these were not enough in number or in size greater\r\nones and more were required of them. If they hesitated to comply with\r\nsuch demands, or if they were shown not to have held firm against the\r\ninvader, they were roughly reminded of the bargain on the terms of\r\nwhich alone all their privileges were held, and saw their charters and\r\nfranchises seized into the King’s hand.[739]\r\n\r\nThis view of the organization of the Cinque Ports for the public\r\nservice was visibly represented in the rule of the King’s officer, the\r\nLord Warden of the Ports and Constable of Dover Castle. His authority\r\nthe men of the Cinque Ports were never for a moment allowed to forget;\r\nand the Lieutenant of Dover or his messengers, continually riding round\r\nthe Ports with message or proclamation or to “make inquisition,”[740]\r\nwere everywhere helped on their way by dinners, breakfasts, pipes of\r\nwine, or a play at the public expense. From Dover came proclamations\r\n“warning us of the Danes”; ordering “that no man should quarrel with\r\nother for none old sores”; commanding “to arrest the men who came\r\nfrom beyond sea without leave and without billets”; or to seize ships\r\nfor crossing over to Flanders; calling out vessels “to watch the\r\nsea”; or to serve the King in siege or battle during the French war;\r\nsummoning men “to keep the Castle of Dover”; or decreeing the amount\r\nof benevolences to be paid to the King.[741] The subjection of the\r\nwhole confederation to his rule was publicly recognized every year\r\nin the Court of Shepway, when at his summons there came from every\r\nport the mayor and a little group of jurats carrying with them the\r\nrequired gifts and dues, wine and swans and fish and spices to furnish\r\nbreakfast for officials and suitors at the court; or costly offerings\r\nto soften the hearts of wardens and judges, and induce them on their\r\nfirst entering into office to look favourably on their subjects. Before\r\nthem as they sat on either side of the Warden on the open plain near\r\nLympne[742] proclamation was made as to the taxes to be raised by the\r\nconfederation, the special military services required of the freemen,\r\nor the new decrees issued by the Government; and special offences\r\nagainst the Crown were judged. A whole community might be charged with\r\na breach of the King’s peace,[743] or an aggrieved corporation made\r\napplication that officers of the Ports should be sent to help in the\r\narrest and punishment of some stranger who had committed a crime in\r\ntheir town; and prisoners from the various towns accused of coining\r\nfalse money, treason, or counterfeiting the King’s seal,[744] were\r\ntried, and if found guilty were forthwith tied on a sledge, drawn round\r\nthe circuit of Shepway, and hanged on the spot.[745]\r\n\r\nNor did the authority of the Warden end at Shepway. As Constable of\r\nthe Castle he had his court-martial in Dover.[746] As Admiral he could\r\norder a “quest of the Admiralty” to be held on the sea-shore, or\r\nperhaps at some one of the Ports which had offended against the laws of\r\nthe confederation—a calamity which the town at once sought to avert\r\nby negociations and bribes “that he should not hold the court.” As\r\nChancellor he issued precepts and summonses as to the services to be\r\nperformed by the Ports in return for their privileges, and exercised in\r\nhis court of chancery the complicated jurisdiction that gradually arose\r\nout of these records. There were moments when the King was stirred to\r\na recollection of his sovereignty—moments when the towns had pushed\r\nindependence too far, or when the treasure in the royal coffers had\r\nfallen low; then from Westminster a writ of enquiry would come as to\r\nthe privileges of the Ports, delegates were summoned from the various\r\ntowns to appear before the Warden, and might find themselves kept\r\nmany days and nights at Dover[747] while “inquisition was made for\r\nthe King.” Sometimes they were ordered to assemble on the sea-shore.\r\nSometimes the Warden came down the steep path of the castle hill to\r\nthe tiny church of S. James, set in the first little reach of level\r\nground below the walls of the fortification, and there the jurats came\r\nup to meet him from their lodgings in the town below, and after days of\r\ndiscussion probably returned home with heavy news of fines to be levied\r\nfor buying a new charter, or for getting the confirmation of some\r\ndoubtful privilege.\r\n\r\nIn the authority of the Warden we see the view held at Westminster\r\nabout the uses of the Cinque Ports and the main object of their\r\nexistence. To the people on the other hand the association had another\r\nand wholly different character. So completely was all the business\r\nof the Warden’s court at Shepway looked on by the portsmen as the\r\nKing’s affair, and so slight was their sense of participation in it,\r\nthat they presently gave up attending it altogether, leaving the\r\nWarden at last to preside in solitary state. In course of time even\r\nthe ancient site was abandoned, and instead of the annual assembly at\r\nShepway the president only summoned an occasional court of appeal to\r\nbe held at Dover,[748] and there, surrounded by a group of lawyers\r\nto advise him, sat on the chalk cliff fronting the castle to hear\r\ncertain cases immediately touching the King’s interest.[749] Meanwhile\r\nthe barons of the Ports had their own tradition of independence and\r\nself-government; and the popular belief as to the object and meaning of\r\nthe confederation was embodied in another court which sat on the Broad\r\nHill, near Romney—a court where the Lord Warden had no seat.[750] It\r\nwas there that the whole interest of the people centred, as turning\r\ntheir backs on the King’s courts and leaving him to conduct through\r\nthe Lord Warden the matters which were his peculiar business, they\r\noccupied themselves with the management of their own special affairs.\r\nFor to the fisherman of the coast the confederation of the villages\r\nwas in its origin and working simply a great trading company of the\r\nPorts for the protection of their staple business, the herring fishery,\r\nand for the preservation of their ancient customs of harbourage and\r\nsale on the strand at the mouth of the Yare—a matter which became\r\nof absorbing importance when their monopoly was threatened by the\r\nfishermen of Yarmouth, so that from the time of John onwards they could\r\nonly preserve their interests by ceaseless vigilance and by costly\r\nappeals to King and Parliament, and Council.[751] In the eyes of the\r\nbarons therefore the great assembly of the confederation was that which\r\nyearly met to discuss the business of the Yarmouth fair. And this was\r\nin the strictest sense a court of the people themselves, summoned only\r\nby common consent,[752] presided over by the chief magistrate of each\r\nPort in turn, and in which every town was represented by its mayor\r\nor bailiff, three elected jurats, and three commons. The sheltered\r\nharbour of Romney formed a sort of natural centre of the Ports, and the\r\ndelegates met for business on the Broad Hill or Bromhille of Dymchurch\r\nclose by, whence they possibly took the name of Brodhull, a name which\r\nin later days when the first site was forsaken and forgotten and the\r\ndelegates met in Romney itself, became changed into “Brothyrhill” or\r\nBrotherhood.[753]\r\n\r\nOn the first day of meeting the business, as befitted an association\r\nfor trading purposes which dated back to the time when the herring\r\nfishery was the staple trade of the Ports, was invariably the Yarmouth\r\nfair, and the court heard the report of the bailiffs of the last fair\r\nwho stood bare-headed before them, and elected their successors who\r\nwere to govern the coming fair.[754] But other interests had grown up\r\nround the assembly hill. The seafaring population, masters and mariners\r\nof trading barges, saw in the union of Ports the power which regulated\r\nthe relations of seamen on either side of the Channel. To the taxpayers\r\nit was a voluntary association for the equitable adjustment of their\r\nburdens. And all the inhabitants alike recognized its importance for\r\nmaintaining against lords of other franchises the privileges which had\r\nbeen granted them in return for their services.[755]\r\n\r\nOn the great day when the Yarmouth fair was under discussion the\r\nCourt of Brotherhood sat alone; but on the following days when other\r\nwork was to be done—the distribution between the various towns of\r\nthe taxation[756] ordered at Shepway, the discussion of commercial\r\nrelations,[757] the care of the common corporate privileges of the\r\nconfederation[758]—the Court of Brotherhood was joined by the Court\r\nof Guestling, probably a descendant of the ancient Hundred Court once\r\nheld in the old town of Gestlinges near the border-line of Kent and\r\nSussex.[759] To this court each town might send the mayor, two jurats,\r\nand two commoners; so that if all the delegates came the number of\r\nthe united assemblies would be seventy-seven; as a matter of fact\r\nhowever in the time of Henry the Sixth the business was done by about\r\nthirty members.[760] All the important affairs of the Cinque Ports\r\npractically lay in their hands, and their decisions, registered as Acts\r\nof the Brodhull by the Common Clerk of the Cinque Ports,[761] became\r\nthe law of the whole confederation.\r\n\r\nConstantly reminded of their ancient covenant and confederation by\r\nimminent perils, arduous exertions and recurring taxes, trained to\r\nhabits of vigilance and mutual support, the Cinque Ports kept a jealous\r\nwatch against the slightest infraction of the privileges of their\r\nunited body. But there was one matter with which the confederation had\r\nnothing whatever to do. Subject to a variety of jurisdictions, some of\r\nthem depending on the King, some on the Archbishop, some on a bigger\r\nneighbouring town, the special liberties of each borough had been\r\ndeveloped under very different conditions; and the whole association\r\ntook no heed of the defence of the liberties of any single Port against\r\nits lord, or the enlargement of the privileges of any one member of\r\ntheir society as apart from the whole.[762] The corporate existence of\r\nthe united Cinque Ports was a thing altogether apart from the corporate\r\nexistence of each town within it; and indeed combination for any\r\npurpose of securing local liberties would have been out of the question\r\nin a confederacy where a certain outward uniformity was but the screen\r\nof endless diversity, and towns bound together by special duties and\r\nprivileges were widely separated from one another in all the conditions\r\nof government.[763] This is very evident if we compare the situation of\r\nSandwich and Romney—much more so if we consider the position of any of\r\nthe subordinate members of the Ports.\r\n\r\nI. For many centuries Sandwich belonged to the monks of Christ Church,\r\nCanterbury, and so long as it was a humble little port powerful kings\r\nlike Eadgar, Cnut, Henry the First, and Henry the Second had been\r\ncontent to have it so, and with indifferent acquiescence confirmed the\r\nmonastic rights over the town. But when in the course of time Sandwich\r\nbecame the port through which almost the whole of the continental trade\r\nwith England passed, when its commerce and revenue increased till\r\nit stood far before Dover in importance,[764] when it was the chief\r\nharbour from which monarchs or their ambassadors set sail for France,\r\nor from which armies were sent forth in time of war, the King began to\r\nlook more seriously on the powers exercised over it by the convent. An\r\ninquest ordered by the Crown in 1227 reported in favour of the rights\r\nof Christ Church over Sandwich, but by judicious bargaining matters\r\nwere finally arranged to the royal satisfaction. At the price of a\r\ngrant of lands in Kent Edward the First bought the town, and though the\r\nmonks were still allowed certain lands and houses free from municipal\r\ncharges, and continued to receive large sums from the wharf which was\r\nknown as Monkenkey with its crane for loading and unloading ships,[765]\r\nand from the warehouses enclosing it, they had to abandon their powers\r\nof taxing at discretion all passengers and goods which crossed the\r\nbounds of their territory.[766]\r\n\r\nThe Sandwich people had elected their own mayor since the beginning of\r\nthe thirteenth century; while the royal interests were now looked after\r\nby a bailiff appointed by the King.[767] The townsmen however kept a\r\njealous watch over their own prerogatives. When in 1321 Christ Church\r\nobtained a royal writ to protect their property from the town taxes the\r\nmayor and community refused to accept it because it had been issued\r\nto the King’s bailiff, and the convent had to get a new writ.[768]\r\nThe bailiff’s powers were carefully defined and kept in strict\r\nsubordination to those of the mayor. He collected the King’s dues\r\non goods brought into the town;[769] and it was he who summoned the\r\nHundred Court every three weeks to meet in S. Clement’s church for view\r\nof frankpledge, for pleas of land, questions of trespass, covenant,\r\ndebt, battery, bloodshed, and so on;[770] but he could not hold the\r\ncourt without the mayor’s leave, nor issue the summonses without the\r\nmayor’s orders.[771] The mayor for his part, if he was elected in S.\r\nClement’s, the church where the courts of the King were held, had his\r\nseat of government in S. Peter’s, a church that stood in the very\r\ncentre of the town near the Market-place and Common Hall, and in whose\r\ntower the “Brande goose bell” hung which summoned jurats and council\r\nmen to the Common Assembly, and rang out the hours for the market. He\r\ngathered the Town Council for business to S. Peter’s, and in S. Peter’s\r\nhe sat every Thursday, and if business required it on other days, to\r\njudge the people.[772] Though the bailiff sat by his side and took part\r\nin the business of the court, yet for offences against the corporation\r\nthe mayor and jurats might punish the freemen “without consulting the\r\nbailiff or any one else.”[773] To them belonged the entire regulation\r\nof trade and the management of weights and measures, for “the bailiff\r\nhas nothing to do with this business.” In no case was he allowed to\r\ninterfere with the town market; “that business belongs wholly to the\r\nmayor and jurats,” the town customs declared.[774]\r\n\r\nII. Sandwich in fact after it had passed to the Crown enjoyed the full\r\nfreedom common to the royal boroughs. Bound only by allegiance to the\r\ngeneral law of the Cinque Ports it long maintained, as we shall see\r\nlater, a real independence of local life and a vigorous democratic\r\ntemper. But in Romney, in the very port where the general assembly of\r\nthe Cinque Ports held its deliberations, the conditions were wholly\r\ndifferent. For a moment Romney like other towns enjoyed its share\r\nof profits in the growing trade of the country.[775] The vintners\r\nengaged in the wine trade rose from ten in 1340 to forty-eight who\r\nheaded the list of taxpayers in 1394; a new ward was called after its\r\ncloth-dealer Hollyngbroke;[776] and merchants from Prussia, Holland,\r\nSpain, and Flanders, citizens of Bristol and of London, men from York\r\nand from Dorset gathered within its walls. But a doom was already on\r\nthe town. As early as 1381 it had begun its vain struggle against winds\r\nand tides which silted up its port, destroyed its river channel, and\r\nforced the Rother into a new bed. Dutch and Flemish engineers had been\r\ncalled over to make scientific sluices and barriers, and the whole\r\npopulation had been summoned out to dig a water-course, but in spite of\r\nincessant efforts the men of Romney saw their trade driven into other\r\nports.[777] The forty-eight vintners of 1394 had sunk to forty-four\r\nin 1415, to five in 1431, and to one in 1449.[778] The burghers were\r\nbeing steadily ruined, and the story of their decay remains registered\r\nin the long lists of citizens who pledged their goods for debt, giving\r\nin promise of payment saddles, cups, table-cloths, helmets, cloths,\r\nwhich were delivered by the creditor into the hands of the bailiff for\r\nkeeping in the Common Hall “according to custom,” and when the day of\r\npayment had passed were appraised by bailiff and jurats, often at half\r\nor a quarter of the value at which they had been first declared, and\r\nhanded over to the creditor.[779]\r\n\r\nThrough good and evil fortune moreover Romney had to maintain a\r\nconstant struggle for freedom. The Archbishop of Canterbury was lord\r\nof the manor, and appointed, subject to the ratification of the Lord\r\nWarden, the bailiff of the town,[780] choosing if it seemed good to\r\nhim one of his own servants or squires, and by a curious exception\r\nfrom the general law having liberty to select a publican.[781] The\r\nbailiff fixed the days for holding the market. He gathered in the\r\nArchbishop’s dues, made sure that his share of any wax, or wine, or\r\ngoods cast on the shore from wrecks was handed over, and that the\r\njurats collected in proper time the capons and swans and cygnets which\r\nhad to be sent to him, or that a porpoise taken by the fishermen should\r\nbe duly despatched to the lord. The common horn sounded twice at the\r\nmarket-place and at the cross to summon the people to his court.\r\n\r\nThe question of government and of the bailiff’s position was however\r\nalways in debate. The “best men of the town” rode to Archbishop\r\nCourtenay “to know his will and what he proposed to do against their\r\nliberties”; and for the following century the Romney men were always\r\non the watch, and heavily taxed in gifts and bribes “to protect the\r\nliberty of the town that the said lord might not usurp it.”[782]\r\nThe bailiff’s power indeed was strictly limited. So far as the\r\nadministration of justice went he was absolutely controlled by the\r\ntwelve jurats who were yearly elected “for to keep and govern the port\r\nand town;”[783] and “in case the bailiff do other execution than the\r\nsworn men have judged against the usage of the town” they might fine\r\nhim £10 to the commons.[784] But this was not enough. In 1395 the\r\njurats made suit to the Lord Archbishop to “put his bailiwick into the\r\nhands of the community of Romney at ferm,”[785] and for the century\r\nwhich followed they were always seeking for some means of gaining\r\ncomplete control of the government. For lack of better security a\r\nsimple expedient was discovered. The townspeople allowed a custom to\r\ngrow up that the Archbishop should not be expected to appoint a new\r\nofficer every year, but that whoever was sent to the town should be\r\nunderstood to hold his post permanently. When in 1521 the prelate\r\ncomplained that the jurats would not let his bailiff enter Romney[786]\r\nthey answered that when there was no bailiff in the town the Archbishop\r\nmight send a new one, but that the accustomed bailiff who had been\r\nadmitted seven or eight years ago was still living and was “of good\r\nname and fame,” and so the place was not void; moreover, they said,\r\na bailiff must make his appearance with certain formalities and “be\r\nof good opinion,” but this new man had not been sent with the proper\r\nforms. The fixity of tenure[787] which the townsfolk thus raised to the\r\ndignity of a “customary” right was a real guarantee that the bailiff\r\nshould no longer be a mere dependent holding his post at the pleasure\r\nof a distant master, trembling under the apprehension of hazarding his\r\nemployment by preferring the interests of the commonalty to those of\r\nhis lord, and only intent on heaping up treasure against the day when\r\nhis credit and employment should come to an end. He became more and\r\nmore identified with the townsfolk among whom he lived, and on whose\r\napproval he was made dependent by their contention that he should hold\r\noffice so long as he was, in their opinion, “of good name and fame.”\r\n\r\nBut the burghers were still dissatisfied with so precarious a tenure\r\nof independence. There was a proposal which came to nothing to unite\r\nthe bailiff and jurats of the town with the bailiff and jurats of the\r\nmarsh; but in 1484 the people profited by the troubles of Richard’s\r\nreign to plan a thoroughgoing revolution.[788] They set up a mayor for\r\nthemselves, and sent to have a silver mace made at Canterbury under the\r\nvery walls of the Cathedral precincts. The Archbishop called in the\r\nhelp of the Crown and the great people of the London law courts, and\r\nafter much battling and negotiation the matter was ended before the\r\nyear was out by a Privy Seal being sent down to Romney to depose the\r\nmayor. Before a generation had passed away however the struggle broke\r\nout again with new vigour, and in 1521 town and prelate were again\r\nquarrelling over all the old grievances.[789]\r\n\r\nThe main point of the burghers’ argument was to deny the Archbishop’s\r\nassertion that “the town is all bishopric.” The jurats contended that\r\n“from all time” they had had the privileges of one of the capital Five\r\nPorts, that their grant of “streme and strond” of the sea and all other\r\nrights came to them from the King and not the Archbishop; and that they\r\nheld the greater part of their town directly from the Crown,[790] on\r\nwhich land the Archbishop had no right to enter, and the commonalty had\r\nrights of justice. So also the Archbishop had no right to the marsh and\r\npasturage of four hundred acres which had once been creek and haven,\r\nbut had been left dry land since about 1380 by the withdrawal of the\r\nsea a good half-mile from the town, for this “void place” left by\r\nthe main course of the stream through the town belonged to the King.\r\nArguing therefore from this fiction of being on royal soil the jurats\r\nwent on to claim the popular control of justice which was used in royal\r\nboroughs, and frowardly kept the courts without the bailiff, boldly\r\nasserting in their own defence that he was at the best but a minister\r\nof the King’s courts in Romney and not a judge; for if the town courts\r\nwere in fact courts of the King, they were under the royal grants and\r\ncharters which ordained that mayor and jurats, or bailiff and jurats,\r\n_elected by the people_, were to hold courts, hear pleas, and have\r\nfines and amercements and other profits of leets and law-days; and\r\ntherefore since the bailiff of Romney was not elected by the commons he\r\nwas clearly excluded and had nothing to do in the said courts save as\r\nminister and executioner, and any record of pleas before him was void.\r\nIn times past, they declared, he had merely been allowed to sit among\r\nthem by favour, and not of duty. The fines raised at leets and law-days\r\nthey claimed for the town’s use, saying that these had only been given\r\nto the most Reverend Father by the favour of the jurats to obtain his\r\ngood lordship; but that he had never any right whatever to leet or\r\nlaw-day, fine or amercement. So persistent were their protestations\r\nof independence that it seems as though ultimately the Archbishop’s\r\nheavy wrath settled down to rest on the town. When Cranmer leased out\r\nthe bailiwick of Hythe to the townspeople,[791] he refused to give\r\nto Romney a similar lease—a gift which it had begged of Courtenay a\r\nhundred and fifty years before. Cranmer’s lordship indeed came to an\r\nend at the Reformation, but even then Romney was for a time governed\r\nby its senior jurat, and it was not until 1563 that it seemed to have\r\nsufficiently purged its iniquity, and that Elizabeth finally allowed\r\nits people to elect a mayor.\r\n\r\nIII. From the instances of Sandwich and Romney it is evident that the\r\nbond which existed between the chief Ports only served certain definite\r\nends, and had no influence whatever on the developement of local\r\nliberties or the intimate relations of a borough to its lord. And if\r\nthis was the case with the leading Ports, still less was it possible\r\nfor the subordinate members of the confederation to look for aid in\r\ntheir private controversies. Romney itself for example in the midst\r\nof its struggle with the Archbishop was engaged in a resolute effort\r\nto retain its own hold over its dependent town of Lydd. There also\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury was lord of the manor, both of the town\r\nand of a great part of the grazing land round it known as Dengemarsh,\r\nin which lay the fishing-station of Lydd, Denge Ness; while the rest\r\nof Dengemarsh was divided between the Abbot of Battle, the Castle of\r\nRochester, and Christ Church, Canterbury, all alike ready to raise at\r\nany time questions of disputed rights. As far as the Archbishop was\r\nconcerned the townsmen had commuted their services at his court of\r\nAldington for a yearly payment, and became “lords in mean” of their own\r\nborough—possibly in the time of Henry the Sixth when they first began\r\nformally to use the style of Bailiffs, Jurats, and Commonalty of Lydd;\r\nbut the Archbishop’s seal with the mitre was still used in deeds for\r\nselling or letting land.[792]\r\n\r\nBut Lydd was further subject to Romney as “member of the Town and\r\nPort,” and in token of this submission their custumal was kept at\r\nRomney. If they wanted to ascertain their rights they had to send a\r\nmessenger to the superior town; and an entry in the accounts of Lydd\r\ntells how the corporation paid eightpence to “the servant of Romney\r\nbringing authority of having again our franchise.” Romney claimed to\r\nmake awards on disputed questions, interfered about the Lydd markets,\r\nand ordered inquisitions as to whether they had been wrongfully\r\nheld.[793] Moreover as the inhabitants of Lydd “were contributors\r\nto Romney before all memory,” their officers had year after year to\r\npresent themselves before the jurats of Romney in the Church of S.\r\nNicholas carrying their accounts and such payments as were demanded by\r\ntheir rulers.[794] Even after the men of Lydd had been given by Edward\r\nthe First the same liberties and free customs as the other barons of\r\nthe Cinque Ports, the sum of their taxes was fixed by Romney.\r\n\r\nAmong many masters the corporation was kept in a perpetual ferment.\r\nThe boundaries of its territory were not finally decided till 1462,\r\nand the quarrel with Battle on this point kept lawyers and town clerks\r\nbusy hurrying backwards and forwards between London and Lydd, or riding\r\nto Canterbury to get the Abbot’s charter, or to Winchelsea to meet the\r\nAbbot’s counsel.[795] For a hundred years moreover the town kept up\r\nthe long struggle to free itself from the supremacy of Romney. Already\r\nin 1384 deputations from both the towns met in Dover to discuss the\r\nterms of agreement between them with the Warden, and from that time\r\nlawyers were kept constantly at work, and a counsel seems to have been\r\npermanently employed in London, besides the deputations of bailiff,\r\ncommon clerk, and jurats sent there as well as to Dover, Sandwich, or\r\nCanterbury, and the messengers despatched with “courtesies” for the\r\nLieutenant, the Seneschal, or the Clerk of Dover Castle, the Mayor and\r\nClerk of Dover town, the Archbishop of Canterbury and his steward,\r\nthe Common Clerk of Winchelsea and so on; while the salary of the\r\nTown Clerk, Thomas Caxton, probably a brother of the great printer,\r\nwas raised again and again, so as to secure the services of the most\r\nskilful lawyer and able administrator in all the country round.[796]\r\nEven in a trifling matter of taxation it was not till 1490 that the\r\ntown was able to make a composition for a fixed yearly payment.[797]\r\n\r\nIV. In the same way Sandwich had the mastery of the little town of\r\nFordwich,[798] which lay fifteen miles higher up the river and claimed\r\ndominion over a tiny territory reaching back from the water’s edge on\r\neither side as far as a man in a boat on the river could throw an axe\r\nof seven pounds called “Taperaxe.” The inhabitants elected every year a\r\nmayor, treasurer, and jurats to govern them and preserve the liberties\r\nof the town. The mayor with a black knotted stick as badge of his\r\noffice, held his court of justice. He appointed every year four freemen\r\nto act as arbitrators in case of trespass, and if any townsman refused\r\nto accept their decision or tried to carry the cause to another court,\r\nhe was fined the enormous sum of a hundred shillings, or thrown for\r\na year into the town prison, a filthy hole of nine feet square which\r\nstill exists. In capital cases the mayor could give sentence of death,\r\nand order the prosecutor if he won his suit to carry the condemned\r\ncriminal to the “Thefeswell” and himself throw him into it with hands\r\nand feet tied, “knebent” as it was called.[799]\r\n\r\nFordwich however had been granted by the Confessor to S. Augustine’s,\r\nCanterbury.[800] The Abbot owned the soil of the town; his bailiff\r\nlived within its walls and presided over the Hundred Court which he\r\nsummoned by his officer “Cachepol”; he had his own prison; he was\r\nentitled to fines and forfeitures from felons and fugitives; and he\r\nclaimed certain customs on all imports, and asserted a right to control\r\nthe fisheries of the river so as to supply his monks at the fasting\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nThe convent of Christ Church, Canterbury, owned on the other hand a\r\nquay at the highest point to which ships could pass up the river; to\r\nthis quay wine, alum, Caen stone, etc., were brought for the use of\r\nthe monastery, and endless quarrels were developed out of its trading\r\nmonopolies.[801]\r\n\r\nAs a member of the Port of Sandwich the town was subject to certain\r\nregulations and taxations which Sandwich had a right to impose. When\r\nthe chief Ports met to assess and distribute taxation among themselves,\r\nthe voice of the lesser members of the confederation was never heard,\r\nand the dependent towns had simply to pay such proportions of the\r\nsum due as their masters ordered, and there were naturally frequent\r\nsigns of grumbling and dissatisfaction.[802] The severe protectionist\r\nlaws which the Fordwich people passed against Sandwich as to the use\r\nof the common quay with the crane possibly indicates some attempt at\r\nencroachment which it was possible to resist as well as to resent.\r\n\r\nUnder the rude pressure of rival jurisdictions on every side, and from\r\nwhich there was no escape, the corporation needed constant vigilance\r\nin looking after its own interests. Like every other town big and\r\nlittle in the fifteenth century Fordwich made careful research into\r\nthe true limits of its chartered rights, and the clerk wrote out new\r\ncopies of their custumal and of the old record of their boundaries. In\r\nthe only point where they had a chance of success its burghers fought\r\nwith steady pugnacity for their privileges. Protesting that they held\r\na monopoly of the quay where the ships were unloaded, they refused\r\nthe customs demanded by S. Augustine’s, claimed the whole control of\r\nthe river and of the three weirs which were made every year at the\r\nbeginning of the fishing season, and at last forced a compromise which\r\nleft the convent only the produce of a single weir.\r\n\r\nIf the lesser members of the Ports which were themselves corporate\r\nbodies, such as Lydd or Fordwich, could expect from their superiors no\r\nhelp in achieving independence, the non-corporate members were yet more\r\ncompletely withdrawn from the chance of assistance; for the seven great\r\ntowns of the association would have looked with little tolerance on any\r\nrevolt in their dependent villages.[803] Undoubtedly the inhabitants\r\nof the Cinque Ports had their full share of the democratic temper that\r\nruled in the trading towns of the eastern coast from the Wash to the\r\nChannel. Rebellion was in the air; and the labourers and miners of\r\nKent and Sussex had an evil reputation in the Middle Ages as being\r\nmost prone to civil dissensions, “as well for that they can hardly\r\nbear injuries as for that they are desirous of novelties.”[804] There\r\nwas never a rising in which they were not the most eager partizans of\r\nthe revolutionary side. The men of Kent crowded after Cade. Hastings\r\nsent eleven soldiers to help him; Rye begged for his friendship; and\r\nLydd sent its constable on horseback to meet him, wrote him a letter\r\nof excuse for not joining him, and presented him with a porpoise.[805]\r\nWhen Warwick took up the cry of Cade they rallied to his side; and\r\nwhen he brought back Henry the Sixth in 1470 they again gave him\r\nsupport.[806] In the internal politics of the towns we meet the same\r\ntemper; and however obscure and insignificant were the struggles of\r\nthe Ports and of the humble villages that gathered around them, they\r\nreveal to us the militant spirit of self-assertion which was stirring\r\nin every hamlet in England. But with this sturdy spirit of municipal\r\nfreedom the question of federal organization had nothing whatever to\r\ndo. We have seen that the trading privileges won in early days by the\r\njoint action of the towns were confined to the supervision of the\r\nherring fair at Yarmouth, and that the association never developed\r\ninto a great commercial league after the imposing pattern of the\r\ntowns of Picardy or of the Rhine. Still less did the union resemble\r\nany of the federative republics formed across the water in Ponthieu\r\nor the Laonnais for mutual aid against the enemies of their peace or\r\nliberties.[807] There is no evidence that the confederation of the\r\nCinque Ports afforded to its members any security of municipal freedom,\r\nor any extension of the rights to be won from their several lords; and\r\nas a matter of fact this group of favoured towns does not seem to have\r\nmade the slightest advance on other English boroughs, either in winning\r\nan earlier freedom, or in raising a higher standard of liberty. In fact\r\nthe history of the sixteenth century was to prove that there was no\r\nmore formidable opposition to the growing democracies in the Kent and\r\nSussex towns than the respectable official company that gathered at\r\nRomney and ate together the annual feast of the Court of Brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Abbotsbury, convent

The last\r\ncase was under Charles I. (Rogers’s Agriculture and Prices, i. 132).\r\nThe gallows at Southampton stood on the common; in Colchester at the\r\nend of East Street.\r\n\r\n[2] The Inquisition de quo Warranto, Ed. I., proves that S. Martin’s\r\nand other villages were under the jurisdiction of Canterbury; inquests\r\nat these places were held by the city coroner. York had a territory of\r\n2,700 acres. (Agric. and Prices, iv. 579.) The burgesses of Dorchester\r\nclaimed the right to weigh all goods within twelve miles of the town.\r\nA special statute was passed in 1430 “that they shall not be disturbed\r\nof their right,” in consequence of the Act of 1429 ordering weights and\r\nmeasures in every town. (9th Henry VI. cap. vi.) Other instances, such\r\nas Norwich, Nottingham, &c., are too numerous to give.\r\n\r\n[3] The mariners of the Cinque Ports drew up treaties with “French\r\nshipmen,” as to ransom for mariners, sailors, or fishing boats that\r\nmight be captured on either side; the people of the coast were to\r\nbe set free without charge, while “gentlemen” and merchants were to\r\npay whatever the captors chose to ask. The shipowners and merchants\r\nof each port signed the compact; and all the towns of the coast from\r\nSouthampton to Thanet joined the league. The document which was drawn\r\nup was handed over to the keeping of the Lord Warden in Dover, and\r\nin case of dispute messengers from the Ports rode there to see its\r\nprovisions, or to make a copy for their own guidance.

Pirenne, Dinant, 18.\r\n\r\n[9] Dr. Gross gives a list of 150 towns which had gained the right of\r\nhaving a merchant gild—most of them in the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n[10] Edward the First in the thirty years of his rule created\r\nfifty-four new boroughs. In the first eighty years of the fifteenth\r\ncentury the kings only issued nine charters of this kind.\r\n\r\n[11] London was not apparently before other cities in the winning of\r\nliberties. (Round, Geoffrey de Mandeville, 372.) There were reasons\r\nenough for especial caution of Henry the Second in the matter of London.\r\n\r\n[12] Gross, Gild Merchant, i. 73, note; Archæologia, vii. p. 337-347;\r\nStubbs, ii. 486.\r\n\r\n[13] Burgage rents in the earliest times were accounted for by the\r\nofficers not in a lump sum but “as the pennies come in.” Rep. on\r\nMarkets, 13.\r\n\r\n[14] Cutt’s Colchester, 111-117, 126-7.\r\n\r\n[15] Two other innkeepers had much the same stock-in-trade.\r\n\r\n[16] Hist.

In Reading at the\r\nmuster roll of 1311 there appeared eight men armed with sword, bow,\r\narrows, and knife; thirty-three with bows, arrows, and knives; and over\r\ntwo hundred and thirty-five (besides some names lost at the foot of the\r\nroll) with hatchets and knives. In 1371 the town was able to raise a\r\nbody of archers for service abroad; and under Edward the Sixth it sent\r\nfifty soldiers armed with bills, swords, daggers, bows, and arrows, and\r\npaid each soldier forty pence “for the King’s affairs into Boulogne.”\r\nHist.

For Southampton\r\nin 1477, after a century of vain attempts to pave the streets; Davies,\r\n119, 120; in 1384 a tax was levied for pavage; in 1441 accounts were\r\nrendered of paving stones provided; payments were made in 1457 to a\r\nLondon paviour. By the Act each citizen was ordered to pave before his\r\nown door as far as the middle of the street since “the town was full\r\nfeebly paved and full perilous and jeopardous to ride or go therein,\r\nand in especial in the High Street,” so that “strangers thither\r\nresorting have been oftentimes greatly hurt and in peril of their\r\nlives.” For Bristol in 1491 when the whole town seems to have been new\r\npaved. Ricart, 47-48.\r\n\r\n[19] To take a single instance, in 1421 the water-supply of Southampton\r\nwas undertaken by the council, and new leaden pipes provided by the\r\ngrant of a burgess who had thus bequeathed his money “for the good of\r\nhis soul.” An aqueduct was made at considerable expense in 1428; 261\r\ndays’ work at it was paid at from 4_d._ to 6_d._ a day; over £12 more\r\nwas spent on an iron grating for it, and 27_s._ 2_d._ given to the\r\nplumber who fixed it; great stones from Wathe called “scaplyd stonys”\r\nwere carried, with loads of chalk, quicklime, pitch, rosin, solder,\r\nwax, and wood. In 1490 a new well was made with a “watering-place for\r\nhorse and a washing-place for women.” Davies, 115, 117; Hist. MSS. Com.\r\nxi. 3, 138-40.

Stubbs, ii. 574-578. How completely\r\nthe relation of King and commons had been reasoned out by the people we\r\nsee in Langland’s writings.\r\n\r\n  “Then came there a King, and ‘by his crown,’ said,\r\n  ‘I am a king with crown the commons to rule,\r\n  And holy Church and clergy from cursed men to defend.\r\n  And if me lacketh to live by, the law wills that I take\r\n  There I may have it hastelokest; (quickest) for I am head of law,\r\n  And ye be both members, and I above all.’\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  ‘On condition,’ quoth conscience, ‘that thou conne defend\r\n  And rule thy realm in reason right well, and in truth;\r\n  Then, that thou have thine asking as the law asketh;\r\n  _Omnia sunt tua ad defendendum, sed non ad deprehendendum_.’”\r\n\r\n  (Piers Ploughman, passus xxii. 467-472, 478-481.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[31] Stubbs, iii. 77; Rogers, Agric. and Prices, iv. viii.\r\n\r\n[32] See the description of a session of Parliament in Richard the\r\nRedeless, passus iii.

Jusserand (Epopée Mystique du Moyen Age,\r\n101-118), justly points out what a typical representative of common\r\nopinion Langland was. Compare the popular manifesto of 1450. (Hist.\r\nMSS. Com. viii. 267.) “They say the King should live upon his commons,\r\nand that their bodies and goods are his; the contrary is true, for then\r\nneeded him never to set Parliament and to ask good of them.”\r\n\r\n[36] The burden of taxation was gradually being transferred from one\r\nclass to another as subsidies on moveables, and customs on import and\r\nexport were found more productive and more easily managed. Stubbs, ii.\r\n570.\r\n\r\n[37] Reductions of rent are too numerous to give; they occurred\r\neverywhere, and were sometimes apparently bought at a considerable\r\nprice. (See Round’s Geoffrey de Mandeville, 366.) Loans from the towns\r\nseem to have been voluntary. In 1435 the Sandwich commonalty refused to\r\nlend money to the King; and further excused themselves from sending him\r\nsoldiers for the defence of Calais, “having all the men they can spare\r\nalready employed in the service of the Duke of York.” (Boys, 672.) A\r\ngrant to the King was again refused in 1486. (Ibid. 678.) The Norwich\r\ncitizens got into trouble for instituting a suit to have their loan\r\nreturned (Blomefield, iii. 147, 152). In 1424 Lynn lent 400 marks, and\r\nin 1428 the council agreed that burgesses of parliament should receive\r\nfrom executors of the late king a hundred pounds for a pledged circlet\r\nof gold because they could not get more (Hist. MSS. Com. xi. part 3,\r\n161). In 1491 the king was at Bristol, where he had a benevolence of\r\n£1,800 (Ricart, 47-48). At the coming of Richard the Third in 1484,\r\nYork, to gain a reduction of the fee-ferm, agreed to give him 100 marks\r\nin a cup of gold, and to the queen £100 in a dish. A list is given of\r\nthe citizens who subscribed—the mayor giving £20, the recorder £100,\r\nand so on. The whole sum subscribed was £437 (Davis’ York, 167-9, 174).\r\nIt would be quite impossible to mention all the loans, but the instance\r\nof Canterbury is curious as the first foreshadowing of the national\r\ndebt. In 1438 £40 was lent to the king, and in 1443 £50; in these cases\r\nprivate individuals advanced the money in various amounts according to\r\ntheir taste for speculation, and probably got certificates promising\r\ninterest and redemption at par (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. part 1, 139).\r\n\r\n[38] Luchaire, 288-9.\r\n\r\n[39] Luchaire, 64, 137.\r\n\r\n[40] M.

The ideal which\r\nshaped itself in the minds of the men of the middle class was a king\r\nacting as a kind of chief constable, who, by keeping great men in\r\norder, would allow their inferiors to make money in peace.” (Gardiner’s\r\nStudent’s History, 330-1.) “The despondency of the English people, when\r\ntheir dream of conquest in France was dissipated, was attended with a\r\ncomplete decay of thought, with civil war, and with a standing still\r\nor perhaps a decline of population, and to a less degree of wealth.”\r\n(National Life and Character, by Charles Pearson, p. 130-1.) “There are\r\nfew more pitiful episodes in history. Thirty-five years of a war that\r\nwas as unjust as it was unfortunate had both soured and demoralised\r\nthe nation.” “England had entirely ceased to count as a naval power.”\r\nAs for the burgesses, “if not actively mischievous they were sordidly\r\ninert.” (Oman’s Warwick, 4-11, 67, 133.)\r\n\r\n[42] In Ricart’s Calendar in Bristol he enters duly the fact that\r\na battle had been fought and that one side or other was victorious\r\nwithout further comment. He misplaces the date of the murder of Suffolk\r\nthree years, though he might well have remembered it; and he writes as\r\na sort of after-thought in the margin of his record, “and this year the\r\ntwo sons of King Edward were put to silence in the Tower of London.”\r\n(Ricart, 40-46.) In 1460 Norwich had its captain and 120 soldiers with\r\nKing Henry in the north, and all the rest of its available forces had\r\nto hurry off to Edward at his accession. (Blomefield iii. 162-163.)\r\nThe city raised £160 for the coming of Richard the Third to the city,\r\nand £140 for the coming of Henry the Seventh. (Ibid. 173-174.) For\r\nNottingham, see vol. ii. There is no mention of Bosworth in Canterbury,\r\nand Henry the Seventh was received with the same pomp as former\r\nkings. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 145.) For Bosworth, where men stood afar\r\noff waiting to join the victorious side, see Fabyan, 672-673. The\r\npolicy of the burghers was the same in this respect as that of the\r\ngreat Churchmen, who were entirely passive in the real crises of the\r\ncivil war, and so ready to serve every king, that not one of them\r\nsuffered loss from fidelity to any side. (Rogers’ Agricul. and Prices,\r\niv. 9, 10.) The people in general were equally indifferent. “I have\r\nread thousands of documents penned during the heat of the strife,\r\nand have found only one allusion to the character of the times in\r\nthe earlier, and one about the later war of 1470-1.” (Ibid., 19.) An\r\ninteresting parallel to the indifference of the trading communities of\r\nthe fifteenth century during the Wars of the Roses may be seen in the\r\naction of the Merchants’ Company in the civil wars of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. (Lambert’s Gild Life, 177-178.)\r\n\r\n[43] See vol. ii. ch. i.\r\n\r\n[44] In Lydd corn was given to the poor at Christmas and Easter, and\r\ngifts to lepers; payments made from 1480-1485 for Goderynge’s daughter,\r\n“poor maid,” “hosen, shoes, her keep, kertyl-cloth and for making\r\nthereof;” also in 1490, “paid to the poor man keeping the poor child\r\n12 pence.” After a long list of expenses for a thief and making stocks\r\nfor him and a halter, “paid for one pair of shoes to his daughter\r\n3_d._,” and “given to the quest of women 4_d._”; summoned perhaps in\r\nreference to the daughter. (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 527, 526.) In Rye sums\r\nwere paid to the poor on opening the box of maltotes. (Ibid. 494.) For\r\nSouthampton, Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 112; the steward’s book in 1441\r\ncontains a list of alms, £4 2_s._ 1_d._, given away every week to poor\r\nmen and women. (Davies, 294.) According to the usual calculation at\r\nthis time in almshouses of a penny a day for living, this sum would\r\nmean that the corporation paid weekly for the mere subsistence of 140\r\npersons. For Bristol, Ricart’s Kalendar, 72-80, 82, &c. For Chester,\r\nHist. MSS. Com. viii. 371. For Romney, Hist. MSS. Com. v. 535-6. The\r\nMayor of Sandwich had to manage the hospitals of S. Bartholomew and\r\nS. John, to appoint their officers, to audit their accounts, and\r\nadminister their estates made up of innumerable parcels of land and\r\nhouses left by pious people. (Boys, 17-21, 526.) The municipal council\r\nof Exeter appointed every year a Warden of the Poor to look after their\r\nmany charitable foundations. It had charge of Magdalen Hospital, of the\r\nTen Cells Hospital for Poor, founded in 1406 by Simon Grendon, Mayor;\r\nthe Combrew Almshouse, founded by Sir William Bonville, 1408; and an\r\nalmshouse founded by John Palmer. (Freeman’s Exeter, 175-6.) There\r\nwas a municipal almshouse in Hereford supported by way of payment to\r\nthe corporation from ecclesiastical tenants for a share in the city’s\r\nprivileges. (Arch. Ass. Journ. xxvii. 481.) In the fifteenth century\r\nbequests by burgesses for these purposes were very frequent and were\r\nusually left to the management of the corporation. In all large towns\r\nthe mayor and aldermen presided over the court of orphans. (Davies’s\r\nSouthampton, 239.) The indications of poor relief by the towns must\r\nmodify Mr. Ashley’s conclusion (Economic History, I. part ii. 338)\r\nthat “no attempt was made by the State as a whole, _or by any secular\r\npublic authority_, to relieve distress. The work was left _entirely_\r\nto the Church, and to the action of religious motives upon the minds\r\nof individuals.” It seems difficult to follow in this connexion his\r\ndistinction drawn between the craft associations which had or had not\r\ngrown out of religious fraternities (p. 325).\r\n\r\n[45] Besides the customary Latin prayers a Norfolk guild used English\r\nprayers for Church and State, harvest and travellers, like our Litany.\r\n(English Guilds, 111-114.) The play of the Lord’s Prayer was performed\r\nby a York guild. “They are bound to find one candle-bearer, with seven\r\nlights, in token of the seven supplications in the Lord’s Prayer.”\r\n“Also they are bound to make, and as often as need be to renew, a table\r\nshowing the whole meaning and use of the Lord’s Prayer, and to keep\r\nthis hanging against a pillar in the said cathedral church near to the\r\naforesaid candle-bearer.” (Ibid. 137-9.) See also Hibbert’s Shrewsbury\r\nGuilds, 62. For Pecok as “the first author of the Middle Ages who\r\npropounded reason as a judge of faith,” and one who “might be claimed\r\nas at once the forerunner of the Erastian theory of the church, and\r\nof the Rationalist interpretation of its theology”; and for the place\r\nnow given to general councils see Rogers’s Agriculture and Prices, iv.\r\n11-13. For the first signs that the revenues of monastic houses were to\r\nbe devoted to other purposes.

The fine was at\r\nfirst half an old noble, and demanded by a colour of a fraternity of\r\nS.

On the\r\ncomplaint of the merchant adventurers living outside London Parliament\r\nordered that the fine should only be ten marks. (12 Henry VII.,\r\ncap. 6.)

The king ordered certain payments to be made for the\r\nship which the town for some months absolutely refused to carry out.\r\nThe sheriff at last stepped into the breach and paid the sums due from\r\nmoney in his own office, and the next year the town was forced by the\r\nking to refund what he had spent. Three successive sheriffs were in\r\ndifficulties about this dispute between the king and the town. They\r\nmade payments as best they could, and were afterwards given indemnity\r\nfor the sums they spent. (Hist. MSS.

If the petition\r\nis read to the close the passage seems to be merely a piece of fine\r\nwriting to arrest attention, and the town franchises are not mentioned\r\nagain when the king asks to have the real grievances stated. In the\r\nsecond petition (Rot. Parl. ii. 332) the gist of the complaint is that\r\nforeign merchants are allowed to sell and buy in England, which is\r\nrepresented as a loss of all their franchises.\r\n\r\n[136] Hist. MSS.

Along with other towns\r\nit had made profit by selling ships to aliens, which might afterwards\r\nbe used by the enemies of England, and a proclamation was sent to Rye\r\nin 1390 forbidding such sales.

The council filled up its own\r\nvacancies. Every merchant using the dealings of a Merchant Adventurer\r\nwas not only to pay its tolls and taxes, but must enter the fellowship\r\nand pay his ten marks.

This decision seemed to imply the ruin of Staplers,\r\nbut the next year it was explained that the authentic interpretation\r\nwas simply that “the merchants of the Staple at Calais using the feate\r\nof a Merchant Adventurer passing to the marts at Calais should _in\r\nthose things_ be contributories to such impositions and charges” as the\r\nAdventurers had fixed (ibid. 549); and that they could not be compelled\r\nto join the Adventurers’ company. In 1510 Henry the Eighth repeated\r\nthe decree of Henry the Seventh that the Adventurers must not force\r\nStaplers to join their body (555). For the pleadings before the Star\r\nChamber under Henry the Eighth see Schanz, ii. 556-564.\r\n\r\n[187] Schanz, i. 249.\r\n\r\n[188] Keutgen, 42, 51-54.\r\n\r\n[189] Schanz, i. 251.\r\n\r\n[190] Keutgen, 30, 81.\r\n\r\n[191] Ibid. 44, &c.\r\n\r\n[192] Pauli’s Pictures, 172, 185. Keutgen, 10-43. Richard the Second\r\ncomplained to the Grand Master that traders were forced to carry their\r\ncloth to Elbing instead of Danzig (ibid. 72). In 1388 three citizens\r\nof London and York were sent to Marienberg with an interpreter to\r\nmake a treaty of commerce with the “general master of the house of S.\r\nMary of Teutonia.” (Hist. MSS. Com. i. 109.) In 1397, however, trade\r\nwith the Easterlings was practically stopped. The English imposed\r\nenormous duties on German imports; the Germans forbade traffic in\r\nEnglish cloth. For the negotiations carried on by Henry the Fourth see\r\nLiteræ Cantuarienses, iii. xxviii.-xxxi., and the various letters on\r\nthe subject. The English colony in Danzig increased greatly after the\r\npeace of Marienberg. (Schanz, i. 231.) In 1392 more than 300 English\r\ncame into Danzig to carry corn. (Keutgen, 71.) But the resistance of\r\nthe Danzig burghers to English trade was strenuous. They were less\r\njealous of the Netherlands manufacturers, and the Teutonic Order in the\r\nfifteenth century sent to Dinant for the rough cloth needed for the\r\nBaltic trade.

MSS. Com. xi. 3, 203).\r\nIn 1427 he wrote to the English merchants “in partibus Prucie, Dacie,\r\nNorweie, Hanse, and Swethie commorantes,” to assemble in a sufficient\r\nplace, elect governors and make ordinances for self-government in\r\nmercantile matters, and for reasonable punishment of any merchants\r\ndisobedient (203). At times the English even forced compensation from\r\nthe Hanse merchants for outrages (Schanz, i. 250). In 1438 rye was\r\nbrought from Prussia “by the providence of Stephen Browne,” the mayor,\r\nat a time of famine in England, when a bushel of corn was sold for 3s.\r\n4d., and the people were making bread of vetches, peas, beans, and\r\nfern-roots.

The\r\nbailiffs and community of Chepstowe did trade with Iceland and Finmark.\r\n(Proc. Privy Council, iv. 208.) In 1426 Lynn forbade trade with Iceland\r\nto its inhabitants and the whole community sent a petition against the\r\ntrade to the King’s Council. (Hist. MSS.

Ordered at Bruges through the Florentine agents there (the\r\nPortinari), probably by Julian and Lorenzo de Medici, the picture could\r\nnot be carried to Florence on account of this war begun in 1468. At\r\nlast in 1473 it was sent off from Sluys in a British-built ship, which\r\nhad been bought by English merchants as a French prize, chartered by\r\nFlorentines in Bruges for a voyage to London, registered in the name of\r\nthe Portinari, commissioned by a French captain, and navigated under\r\nthe Burgundian flag for greater security against capture. It was,\r\nhowever, taken off Southampton by a privateer sailing under the Danzig\r\nflag and commanded by a noted captain Benecke. In spite of a bull\r\nissued by Sixtus the Fourth the cargo was sold at Stade and the picture\r\nbrought by the owners of the ship to Danzig. (Crowe and Cavalcaselle,\r\nEarly Flemish Painters, 257-260.)\r\n\r\n[204] Henry the Sixth, on the other hand, brought the help of the\r\nGenoese. Possibly the excessive price of fish mentioned in the Paston\r\nLetters in 1471 may have been caused by the political troubles (iii.\r\n22, 254).\r\n\r\n[205] Schanz, i. 172-9; ii. 388-396.

In 1498 Archduke\r\nPhilip, seeing the utter ruin into which Bruges had fallen, tried\r\nto revive it by ordering that all foreign merchants should do their\r\nbusiness there only, by improving the harbour, _and by making it the\r\nStaple for English cloths in Flanders_. (Schanz, i. 26-27.) In 1501\r\nPhilip made Bruges a Staple where English cloth might be sold in\r\nFlanders under strict conditions. (Ibid. ii. 203-6.) In 1506 Henry won\r\nfrom the Archduke the right to sell cloth by the yard and to have the\r\nmanufacture of it finished in all his dominions except Flanders. (Ibid.\r\ni. 31.)\r\n\r\n[211] The friendly way in which the English merchants even in 1405\r\nlooked on Genoese traders is illustrated in the story told by Fabyan\r\n(571), of three carracks of Genoa laden with merchandise plundered\r\nby English lords. The Genoese merchants made suit to the King for\r\ncompensation, and meanwhile borrowed from English merchants goods\r\namounting unto great and noble sums. When their suit was seen to be in\r\nvain they made off with their spoils “to the undoing” of many merchants.\r\n\r\n[212] Hunt’s Bristol, 97-8.\r\n\r\n[213] For the anxiety as to the friendship of powerful maritime states\r\nsee the French boast of the alliance of Spain and Genoa; Heralds’\r\nDebate, 59. It is interesting to notice that both Edward the Fourth\r\nand Henry the Seventh preferred Florence to Venice. Disputes about the\r\nVenetian wool trade under Henry the Sixth are mentioned in Bekynton’s\r\nCorresp. i. 126-9.\r\n\r\n[214] The price of wine had been raised in England by new rules about\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n[215] A pilgrim to Rome in 1477 got letters in London on the bank of\r\nJacobo di Medici.

The Florentines promised to buy no wool save from English ships. The\r\nEnglish on their side were bound to carry yearly to Pisa an average\r\nquantity for all the Italian states save Venice. In Pisa they were to\r\nhave all the privileges of inhabitants and to have land for a building.\r\n\r\n3.

The troops struck, however, and insisted on having\r\nthe whole twenty-eight days’ pay before they started, and the town had\r\nat last to give in as the only way of getting the expedition started.\r\n(Davies’ York 132-7.)

In 1484 a great riot broke out in York on the question of the\r\ncommon lands. The King had begged the council to make an order that a\r\nclose which belonged to S. Nicholas, but was common from Michaelmas to\r\nCandlemas, should be “closed and several” for the use of the hospital\r\nif the commons would agree to the same. The order was made, but a\r\nfew days after Michaelmas, when the close was not thrown open as was\r\ncustomary, the citizens met in a “riotous assembly or insurrection”\r\nwhich led to interference of the King. (Davies’ York, 190-198.) In\r\nWinchester (1414) John Parmiter was punished for accusing the mayor\r\nof intending to sell the Coitebury mill without consent of the\r\ncitizens.

Three leading men, who advanced large sums to\r\ndo honour to Edward the Fourth on his first coming to the city in 1460,\r\nwaited four or five years for their money. (Ibid. ix. 139-140.) In Lynn\r\nthe loans to the corporation were on a very great scale according to\r\nthe ideas of the time, and the municipal debt, entirely raised on the\r\nspot, was as permanent and as progressive as that of a modern town.\r\n\r\n[253] Madox, Firma Burgi, 159.

For forty years the men of Romney fought\r\na desperate battle with the sea and the changing bed of the Rother to\r\npreserve the harbour on which their prosperity depended. In 1381 they\r\nspent nearly £9 on making a sluice (Boys’ Sandwich, 803); there were\r\nheavy payments for it again in 1388, and in 1398 John Roan was brought\r\nover from Flanders to take charge of it. The commons turned out in 1406\r\nfor “digging the common Rie,” or bed of the Rother, and in 1409 were\r\nagain busy “digging the water-course.” In 1410 Gerard Matthyessone was\r\nbrought over from Holland to make the sluice at a cost of £100; in 1412\r\nover £44 was spent on it besides clothing for Gerard and his household;\r\nand in 1413 payments were still being made to him. A few years later\r\nin 1422 his place was taken by another Dutchman, Onterdel, who seems\r\nto have finished the work, for after this there are only charges for\r\nslight repairs.

In Canterbury four minstrels were appointed\r\nevery year, and each one was given a silver scutcheon worth 100s.—a\r\nbadge which was returned at the end of the year to the city chamberlain.\r\n\r\n[263] Chronicle of the Grey Friars of London (Camden Society), 12.\r\n\r\n[264] Hist.

Plays were given over to certain trades to\r\nact. _Abraham and Isaac_, for instance, was given to the slaters in\r\nNewcastle, the bowyers and fletchers in Beverley, the weavers in\r\nDublin, the parchminers and bookbinders in York, the barbers and\r\nwax-chandlers in Chester.

In\r\nEngland, on the other hand, the town clock and the assembly and curfew\r\nbells in almost all cases were set in the tower of the parish church,\r\nand the ringers paid by the corporation.\r\n\r\n[287] Piers Ploughman, passus vii. 144. In Totnes in the thirteenth\r\ncentury there is a long list of entries such as these:— “Alice wife\r\nof Walter Cochela sits above the seats of Walter rustic;” “Nicholas\r\nson of Henry has his seat by common purchase;” and so on. And down to\r\nrecent times the mayor, who by tradition represents the head of the\r\nMerchant Guild, was charged with appointing seats in the church to the\r\ninhabitants. (Hist. MSS. Com. iii. 242-3.) In Liverpool, “according to\r\nancient custom,” the city officers and their wives had special seats in\r\nS. Nicholas, and after them the householders; “apprentices and servants\r\nshall sit or stand in the alleys.” (Picton’s Liverpool, ii. 53, 54,\r\n57.)

In case payment was refused the common\r\nsergeant, or any officer sent by the mayor, might levy a distress and\r\ncarry off the tenant’s goods to the Guild Hall to be kept till he had\r\nmade satisfaction or paid a fine of 20s. (Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 161.)\r\nPayments for the holy fire are frequent. (Hist. MSS. Com. iv. 432, v.\r\n549.) Sometimes fines for breach of trade laws went to church uses.\r\n(Gross, ii. 331, 345.)

When Hythe set up its new steeple\r\nin 1480 the twelve jurats headed the list of subscriptions, the\r\ngreatest sum given by them being 10s.

Money was collected for the church at\r\nYaxley, in Suffolk, in 1485 and the following years, by a similar\r\ncustom of the yearly “church ale,” the usual amount contributed from\r\neach householder for his bread and drink being about 4_s._ or 5_s._\r\n(Ibid. x. 4, 465.)\r\n\r\n[302] Boys’ Sandwich, 784.\r\n\r\n[303] In 1327 a violent quarrel broke out between Sandwich and\r\nCanterbury. The convent was put to great inconvenience, and the prior\r\nwrote to “the mayor and bailiff of Sandwich” asking to be allowed to\r\nbuy food and wax, as they had been put to great straits. The Sandwich\r\nmen agreed on condition that the monks should in no manner relieve or\r\ngive supplies to the Canterbury citizens. (Lit. Cantuar. i. 248-254.)\r\nThere was great jealousy between Norwich and Yarmouth. Yarmouth was\r\nmade a Staple town in 1369, in spite of all the efforts of Norwich. In\r\n1390 Norwich paid large sums to have the wool staple at Norwich again.\r\n(Blomefield, iii. 96, 113.) In the fifteenth century Yarmouth set up a\r\ncrane, which the Norwich men forced it to take down again.\r\n\r\n[304] 1478. Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 88.\r\n\r\n[305] The towns were not wholly untouched by the struggle but their\r\ninterest was very languid. Many, like London, were divided in sympathy.\r\n(Polydore Vergil, 106; English Chronicle, 1377-1461, 20-1, 67, 95;\r\nFabyan, 638.) During this queasy season the Mayor of London feigned\r\nhim sick and kept his house a great season. (Ibid. 660; see also\r\nWarkworth’s Chronicle, 12-22.) Bristol and Colchester were Yorkist\r\n(Hunt’s Bristol, 97-100, 102; Cutts’ Colchester, 131-2). For Nottingham\r\nsee vol. ii. The chief interest was probably felt in Kent and Sussex.\r\n(English Chronicle, 1377-1461, 84, 91-4.) Canterbury was against Cade\r\nand Lancastrian in sympathy (ibid. 84-95; Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 140-3,\r\n168, 170, 176-7); but in 1464 entered in its accounts presents to the\r\nbrothers of the king “nunc.” The city suffered severely. The Cinque\r\nPorts went generally for Warwick and York. Lydd sent Cade a porpoise\r\nto London, and a letter to have his friendship in case he succeeded.\r\n(Hist. MSS. Com. v. 518, 520, 523, 525.) For Romney, ibid. 543, 545;\r\nRye, ibid. 492-4; Sandwich, Boys, 676.\r\n\r\n[306] The agricultural tenants and labourers on a manor were accustomed\r\nto elect from among themselves a “Provost” to be head over them and to\r\nstand between them and their lord, whom they were pledged to obey in\r\nall things, and who on his side undertook to answer for them to their\r\nmaster. Bound by the closest ties of mutual responsibility, their\r\nfortunes were inseparably connected. If the lord suffered any loss,\r\nsmall or great, by the tenant’s fault, the provost had to pay the\r\nvalue, recovering it afterwards as best he could from the servant who\r\nwas to blame; and on the other hand if the damage had come through the\r\nprovost’s neglect, and he had not of his own property the wherewithal\r\nto make it good, all those of the township who elected him had to pay\r\nfor him; and hence people and lord alike in self-protection upheld\r\nthe rule that the provost must be no stranger of doubtful character\r\nor property, but chosen “from their own men,” and that “by election\r\nof the tenants.” (Walter of Henley, edited by E. Lamond, Husbandry,\r\n65.) It is easy to see the similarity between the simple methods of\r\nrural government and the organization of municipal independence under\r\nan elected mayor. An admirable illustration is given in Mr. Maitland’s\r\nManorial Pleas, Selden Society, 161-175.\r\n\r\n[307] A citizen of Preston was obliged to show a frontage of twelve\r\nfeet to the street; in Manchester or Salford he was bound to own\r\nat least an acre of land.

Otherwise he was not allowed\r\nto be of the common council of the town.\r\n\r\n[309] At Bury S. Edmunds there were seventy-five tradesmen of various\r\nkinds, bakers, tailors, shoemakers, &c., who were bound to cut corn\r\nin harvest, the services being commuted for a rent called reap silver\r\nwhen the place became a borough. At Battle, under Henry the Second, 115\r\nburgage tenements were occupied by tradesmen who had to work in the\r\nmeadows or at the mill, but were called burgesses “on account of the\r\nsuperior dignity of the place’s excellence.” Rep. on Markets, 17, note.\r\n\r\n[310] From examination of the names of the Norwich inhabitants in the\r\nConveyance Rolls, Mr. Hudson thinks it certainly within the mark to\r\nassume “that the city of Norwich, towards the close of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, had attracted within its sheltering walls natives of at least\r\nfour hundred Norfolk, and perhaps sixty Suffolk, towns, villages, and\r\nmanors.” Notes on Norwich, Norfolk Archæology, vol. xii. p. 46.\r\n\r\n[311] Picton’s Mun.

At the bottom of the list came three men\r\nwhose tenth was assessed, one at 1¼d. and one at ¼_d._ Nott. Records,\r\nii. 285-297.\r\n\r\n[313] The old feeling about burgage property is shown in the custom of\r\nNottingham that when a man sold land his nearest heirs might redeem it\r\nif they made an offer in the Guild Hall within a year and a day of the\r\nsale to pay to the buyer the price he had given; and they might thus\r\nredeem even if the buyer refused to accept their offer. Cases of a\r\nmessuage and a butcher’s booth thus redeemed (Nott. Rec. i. 70, 100).\r\nSee also at Dover (Lyon’s Dover, ii. 274). In Lincoln and Torksey no\r\nburgess could sell his burgage tenement save to a burgess or a kinsman\r\nwithout leave (Rep. on Markets, 35). The mayor and jurats of Rye might\r\ncompel a tenant to keep his house in proper order, “at the request of\r\nhim that is in the reversion.” (Lyon’s Dover, ii. 362.)\r\n\r\n[314] For London rules in 1319 see Lib.

Foreigners no longer lived separately, as in\r\ntowns of the Conqueror’s time, but tended to become completely united\r\nwith the English in customs and law. See Nott.

In\r\n1439 two severe ordinances were passed by the Bristol Council that\r\nno Irishman born might be admitted to the Council by the Mayor under\r\npenalty of £20 each from the Mayor and from the Irishman. In Canterbury\r\nalso the Irish were busy and unpopular traders (Hist. MSS. Com. ix.\r\n173). When Irishmen were ordered out of England in 1422, burgesses and\r\ninhabitants of boroughs of good reputation were excepted. (Statutes 1st\r\nHenry VI. cap. 3.)\r\n\r\n[317] Journ. Arch. Ass. xxvii. 468. There was constant communication\r\nbetween various towns about the character of new settlers who offered\r\nthemselves, and the testimonials preserved to us show how careful the\r\ntowns were in such matters. (Hist. MSS. Com. vi. 488. Piers Ploughman,\r\nedited by Skeat, Part iii. passus iv. 108-116.) No one of illegitimate\r\nbirth might be a burgess. Nott. Rec. ii. 66.\r\n\r\n[318] A bondman born could in many if not in most towns win the freedom\r\nof the city, as in Norwich where serfs were admitted to the franchise;\r\nbut it is clear that here certainly mere residence without admission\r\nto citizenship was no protection against the claims of a feudal lord.\r\n(Norf. Arch. vol. xii.; Hudson’s Notes on Norwich, Sec. xi.) It is most\r\nprobable that the common phrases of “dwelling in the town a year and a\r\nday, and holding land in it and being in lot and scot,” or of being “in\r\nthe Merchant Guild,” or of “remaining in the town _without challenge_,”\r\nwere in fact equivalent to having been received as burghers; and in\r\nsuch cases emancipation was won not by a year’s residence but by\r\na year’s citizenship. In Norwich a serf had to produce his lord’s\r\nlicense. (Hudson’s Leet Jur. in Norwich, Selden Soc. lxxxv.-vi.)\r\nFor a similar instance of feudal claims urged by a lord over his\r\nserf dwelling in a city, see Owen’s Shrewsbury, i. 133. Compare the\r\nreferences given by Gross, i. 30. There were exceptions, as in London,\r\nwhere men who held land in villeinage of the Bishop of London were not\r\nallowed in 1305 to be freemen of the City (Riley’s Mem. 58-9). And\r\nafter the Peasant Revolt some towns withdrew the privilege (Hist. MSS.\r\nCom. i. 109).\r\n\r\n[319] A chaplain and four parsons of churches in Norwich were presented\r\nbefore the Leet Court of Norwich for various offences in 1292, in 1374,\r\nand in 1390. One of them had occupied himself with a large brewing\r\nbusiness, another traded as a wool merchant, and two were charged with\r\nnot being citizens. There were in all towns plenty of “clerici” who\r\nwere citizens. (Hudson’s Norwich Leet Jurisdiction, Selden Soc. pp. 45,\r\n63, 65, 76.) For burgages owned by parsons and clerics in Southampton,\r\nHist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 65, 70, 71, 75, 81. In Romney, where “the\r\nfreedom” seems to have meant more than the right to trade, it was given\r\nto the vicar and others. (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 540, 542, 546-7.) Monks\r\nand heads of religious houses were, according to Dr. Gross, excluded\r\nfrom citizenship (i. 66) though given rights of trade; but from the\r\nCharter Rolls, John, 1215, it appears that in Bridgewater the brethren\r\nof the Hospital of S. John were to be capable of taking up burgages\r\nin the town and to have the same liberties within and without the\r\ntown as burgesses. This instance, has been kindly given to me by Miss\r\nGreenwood from her study of the muniments of the town; she adds that\r\nin the documents at Bridgewater there are many instances of houses and\r\nmarket-stalls being held by clergy. In all the bills of sale _stalls in\r\nHigh Street_ are named burgages, and a lawsuit shows that a wool-stall\r\nthere was sold to the abbot of Michelney. For Ipswich, Gross, ii.\r\n123; and Andover, ibid. 321. Local customs doubtless differed. The\r\nGuild Merchant at Lynn allowed no “spiritual person” to work on their\r\nquay—that is, to trade there (ibid. ii. 166)—a circumstance which\r\nreflects the greater credit on the hermit who about 1349 lived in the\r\nBishop’s marsh by Lynn and set up at his own great cost a certain\r\nremarkable cross of the height of 110 feet, of great service for all\r\nshipping coming that way (Blomefield viii. 514). When the burgesses\r\nof Totnes admitted the abbot and convent of Buckfastleigh into the\r\nMerchants’ Guild, so as to make all their purchases like the burgesses,\r\nall sales that they might attempt to make “by way of trading” were\r\nexcepted.

Corporations, 1835, 19, and especially\r\nthe table given on page 93. Even towns as closely connected as the\r\nCinque Ports differed much in their willingness to admit new burgesses.\r\nThe freedom of Sandwich might be acquired in six ways—by birth,\r\nby marriage with a free woman, by buying a free tenement, by seven\r\nyears’ apprenticeship, by purchase, by gift of the Corporation. In New\r\nRomney freedom could only be acquired by birthright in the male line,\r\nand grant of the Corporation; while in Hythe all children born after\r\nthe father’s admission to freedom were entitled to the freedom, and\r\ndaughters could convey it upon their marriage (Boys’ Sandwich, 787,\r\n796, 799, 812, 821). The same differences existed in other towns. See\r\nDavies’ Southampton, 140; Boase’s Oxford, 48; English Guilds, 390;\r\nFreeman’s Exeter, 142; Hereford, Journ. Arch.

I have met with but\r\none instance in which the King interfered—when Edward the Second by\r\nRoyal Letters Patent granted the right of burgesses at Southampton to\r\nJohn de London of Bordeaux, and in 1312 extended them to his wife and\r\nchildren. (Davies, 190.) Henry the Fourth granted to the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury the right to trade in Ipswich; but this right carried with\r\nit no political privileges in the town. (Hist. MSS.

In the\r\nsixteenth century the jury of the Mickle Tourn of Nottingham presented\r\na request that every foreigner should henceforth pay £10. (Nott. Rec.\r\niv. 170-1. Wells, Hist. MSS. Com. i. 106.) In Dover the payment was\r\n“put into the common horn” by the new freeman (Lyon’s Dover, ii. 306).\r\n\r\n[328] In Preston the rule was that if he had received for his burgage\r\n“a void place” he must set up a house on it within forty days; in other\r\ntowns, as in Norwich or Hereford, he was allowed a year and a day.\r\n(Custumal of Preston, given in Hist. of Preston Guild, 74.

In Hereford if\r\na plaintiff brought a writ of right for the possession of a tenement\r\ninto the court and the defendant refused to appear at the court, “there\r\nought to be taken from the tenement demanded one post and to be brought\r\nunto the court and delivered to the bailiff; and the second time two;\r\nand the third time three; and _this to be done always towards the\r\nstreet, in reproach to him, and to the noting of his fellow-citizens_;\r\nand if he shall not come, the house ought to be thrown down, by taking\r\none post towards the street, and so forward and forward until the whole\r\nhouse be thrown down to the ground.” (Journal Arch.

(Paston Letters, iii. 366.) This protection however was only\r\ngiven on the condition of his renouncing all other aid. The mayor of\r\nYork and his brethren aldermen in 1488 were applied to by Sir Robert\r\nPlumpton to protect some “servants and lovers” of his dwelling in York\r\nfrom annoyance by certain York citizens. The mayor answered in the name\r\nof himself, the aldermen, and the common council, that these dependants\r\nof Plumpton’s had been franchised and sworn to keep the customs of the\r\ncity of York, that they were therefore bound to show any variance or\r\ntrouble to the mayor “and to none other, and he to see an end betwixt\r\nthem.” The mayor plainly intimates that these men must either go home\r\nand live under the protection of their master there, or else if they\r\nstay in York must submit their affairs to the mayor alone “as their\r\nduties had been.” (Plumpton Correspondence, 57-58.)\r\n\r\n[343] Hist.

See Newcastle, Stubbs’ Charters, 107. The importance of these\r\nprovisions is obvious if the custom of Sandwich was common. There the\r\nmayor might arrest and imprison any one whom he chose as a “suspect.”\r\nAfter some time the prisoner was brought from the castle to the Mastez\r\nand a “cry” made to ask if there were any one to prosecute him. If no\r\none appeared he was set free on giving security, but if he could find\r\nno security he might at the mayor’s will be banished for ever from\r\nthe town. The bailiff could not arrest on suspicion as the mayor did.\r\n(Boys’ Sandwich, 687, 466-7.)

As late as the\r\ntime of James I. lords here and there were fighting to keep up old\r\ncustoms. An action was brought by a lord against a townsman of Melton\r\nfor not baking his bread at the lord’s oven; “and the action,” wrote\r\nthe steward, “is like to prove frequent, for the lord’s court there\r\nis scarce able to preserve his inheritance in this custom of baking.”\r\nLives of the Berkeleys, ii. 342-3.\r\n\r\n[375] If a Preston burgher died suddenly, neither lord nor justices\r\nmight seize his lands, which passed on to the next heir; only if he had\r\nbeen publicly excommunicated they were to be given in alms. Custumal.\r\nHist. Preston Guild, 77. Compare Luchaire 248.\r\n\r\n[376] Journ. Arch. Assoc. xxvii. 471. The age was sometimes fixed at\r\ntwelve, sometimes at fourteen. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 244.) The burgher\r\nhad no power to leave by will any lands he held outside the town\r\nliberties, which must pass to the heir appointed by the common law. For\r\nthe frauds to which this might give rise, see Hist. MSS. Com. x. 3,\r\n87-9. Wills bequeathing land were read publicly in the borough courts\r\n(Nottingham Records, i. 96), and there enrolled by the mayor as a Court\r\nof Record. The muniments of Canterbury show that from this right the\r\nmayor went on to claim probate, possibly following the example of Lynn.\r\nThe claim was perfectly illegal, but was energetically pressed.\r\n\r\n[377] Birmingham, which under Henry the Eighth had 2,000 houselings,\r\nand was said to be “one of the fairest and most profitable towns to\r\nthe King’s highness in all the shire” (English Guilds, 247-9), only\r\ncounted in Doomsday nine heads of families. In 1327 these had risen to\r\nseventy-five. The burghers first won the lightening of feudal dues,\r\nwhen Birmingham was freed from ward and marriage, heriot and relief,\r\nso that if a burgess died the lord could only take his best weapon—a\r\nbill or a pole-axe—or forty pence. (Survey of the Borough and Manor\r\nof Birmingham, 1553. Translated by W. B. Bickley, with notes by Joseph\r\nHill, pp. xii., 108.) The bailiff and commonalty rented the stalls\r\nin the market from the lord, and leased them out by their constables\r\nto the townsfolk, fishmongers, butchers, and tanners, and in this\r\nway secured complete control of the town market (pp. 60-61), where\r\nburgesses were exempt from toll, while strangers free of the market\r\npaid a small sum, and those not free a larger amount. After the Plague\r\na “free burgage by fealty” grew up, with an oath to observe the customs\r\nand services of the manor. The normal holding of the villein seems to\r\nhave been forty-five acres, that of the cotters less (pp. xii., xiii.\r\nSee Rogers’ Agric. and Prices, i. 12, 298). As population increased\r\nnew pastures in the foreign were leased out for a term of years at an\r\nannual rent, and while the increase of perpetual free tenures thus\r\nceased the alienation of the whole domain was prevented (pp. xiv., 74,\r\n102). Though the town was not made a borough by royal grant, it had\r\neven in the thirteenth century secured an independent life, called\r\nitself a borough and elected its officers (pp. 60-1, 108-9). Its public\r\nacts were done under the style of “bailiff and commonalty” or “bailiff\r\nand burgesses.” See also Manchester Court Leet Records, 12, 14, 169,\r\n170.

Sometimes the escheator\r\ndivided the fines levied between himself and the King; in other cases\r\nthe office was farmed out and the King took a fixed sum leaving the\r\nescheator a free hand to do what he pleased. In the towns the office\r\nwas finally given to the mayor at a fixed salary. The Mayor of Norwich\r\nreceived as escheator £10; that is, an equal salary to that which he\r\nreceived as Mayor (Blomefield, iii. 179). As Mayor of the Staple he was\r\ngiven £20. (Ibid. iii. 94.)\r\n\r\n[392] He was forbidden by Richard the Second to ride with more than six\r\nhorses, or tarry long in a town. (Statutes, 13 Richard II. 1, cap. 4,\r\nand 16 Richard II., cap. 3.) In 1346 the King by charter freed Norwich\r\nfrom “the clerk of the market of our household,” so that he should\r\nnot enter the city to make the assay of measures or weights, or any\r\nother duties belonging to his office.

As late as 1493 it was necessary for Canterbury\r\n(which had been freed by charter from these exactions in 1414) to get\r\na “breve” from Henry the Seventh to give its inhabitants a summary\r\nmeans of resisting the demands of the King’s Purveyors.

In Canterbury\r\n£36 was paid in 1460 for a new charter, and other payments connected\r\nwith the same business were made in the following year. In 1472\r\nmessengers were sent to London for the obtaining again of a charter of\r\nliberties. Two years later an envoy rode to London to treat with the\r\nTreasurer, Lord Essex, about a writ of proviso touching the liberties\r\nof the city, and a grant was then made, probably in return for heavy\r\npayment, which confirmed a recent restoration of ancient privileges. A\r\nmagnificent supper given to Lord Essex expressed the gratitude of the\r\ncity. In 1474 the city paid for a proviso to confirm the restorations\r\nof their liberties. In 1475 there was an investigation _in camera_ of\r\nthe charters and muniments concerning the bounds of the liberty; and in\r\n1481 payments were made to friends and patrons who had helped them with\r\nthe King in preserving the liberties of the city. At the accession of\r\nHenry the Seventh it became necessary to buy renewal and confirmation\r\nof the charter, and this was completed in 1487. In 1490 the Mayor\r\nconferred with Cardinal Morton on the renewal and extension of the\r\nliberties of the city. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 140 _et seq._, 170.)

Com. ix. 141-3.\r\n\r\n[411] At the important meeting in 1474, when the constitution of\r\nthe town was reaffirmed, William Haute, the lord of the manor of\r\nBishopsbourne (four miles away), who was then patron of the town,\r\nwas put at the head of the list before even the five aldermen, the\r\nsheriff, or any town officers, as establishing and ordaining the town\r\nordinances. Poynings, Browne, Guildford, were at different times\r\npatrons of the city.\r\n\r\n[412] Davies’ York, 128-9, 123-5. For an interesting instance of\r\nbeneficent protection in 1605, see Hibbert’s Influence and Development\r\nof Guilds, p. 95.\r\n\r\n[413] The election of a Mayor as a responsible person through whom the\r\nKing could deal with the town was probably often connected with the\r\nsettlement of the fee-farm rent. In Liverpool the first mention of a\r\nMayor is in 1356, the very next year the fee-farm was granted to the\r\nMayor and others on behalf of the burgesses for ten years. (Picton,\r\nMunicipal Records of Liverpool, i. 13-15.)\r\n\r\n[414] As against the idea of Merewether and Stephens, that charters of\r\nmunicipal incorporation only began in 1439, Dr. Gross points out that\r\nsuch a charter occurs in 1345, that in the time of Edward the First\r\nthe technical conception of municipal incorporation was familiar, and\r\nthat long before the judicial conception came into being the borough\r\nhad a real corporate existence, and exercised all the functions of a\r\ncorporate body. (Gild Merchant, i. 93, &c.)\r\n\r\n[415] In 1391 the Statute of Mortmain was extended to cities and\r\nboroughs. (Statutes, 15 Richard II., cap. 5.) Even when license to hold\r\nland was granted by the Crown the amount was strictly limited, and the\r\npower of refusal or of limitation was a serious consideration to the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n[416] According to Mr. Round, London found means of annexing the shire\r\nof Middlesex instead of asking to be separated from it. (Geoffrey de\r\nMandeville, 347-373.)\r\n\r\n[417] We have a hint of a troublesome mode of interference with the\r\nmunicipal taxation in an incident in Norwich in 1268, when “the lord\r\nthe King commanded all his bailiffs that, _for a fine_ £10, _which\r\nMargaret the Taneresse of Norwich made with the same lord the King_,\r\nhe granted to her such liberty that for the whole time of her life she\r\nshould be quit from all his tallages in the town of Norwich ... for\r\nwhatsoever cause they may be made. And he commanded that they vex not\r\nthe aforesaid Margaret contrary to this his grant.” (Norwich Documents,\r\npr. 1884, 9.) In any case where the tallage was a fixed sum due from\r\nthe town some one else would have to pay Margaret’s share.\r\n\r\n[418] Journ. Arch. Ass. xxvii. 478.\r\n\r\n[419] Journ. Arch. Ass. 479.

For a duel in Leicester in 1201,\r\nsee Select Civil Pleas, Selden Society, p. 33. Judicial combat in\r\nFordwich with an alien had to take place in the middle of the river\r\nStour, the alien standing up to his middle in the water, while the\r\nFordwich man apparently fought from a boat tied to the quay, with an\r\ninstrument called an “ore,” three yards long. (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 442.)\r\nIn 1200 “the citizens of Lincoln came and produced the king’s charter\r\nwhich witnesses that none of them need plead outside the city walls\r\nexcept the king’s moneyers and servants, and that they need not fight\r\nthe duel because of any appeal.” An accused man answered the charges\r\nagainst him “word by word as a free citizen of Lincoln,” and “according\r\nto the franchise of the town” waged law with thirty-six compurgators.\r\n(Select Pleas of the Crown, Selden Society, p. 39.) For compurgation in\r\nSandwich in 1493, Boys, 680.\r\n\r\nWith old forms of trial old forms of punishment were allowed to\r\nsurvive. In Sandwich, if a man failed to clear himself by compurgation\r\nof a charge of homicide or theft he was condemned to be buried alive\r\nin a place called the Thiefdown at Sandown. (Ibid. 465.) Felons were\r\nalso drowned in a stream called “the Gestling”; but in 1313 a complaint\r\nwas made that the prior of Christchurch had diverted the course of the\r\nstream, and that criminals could not be executed in that way for want\r\nof water. (Ibid. 664.) At Dover and Folkestone a thief was killed by\r\nbeing thrown from a cliff, and at Winchelsea was hanged in the salt\r\nmarsh. (Lyon’s Dover, i. 231.) In others of the Cinque Port towns when\r\na thief was taken his ear was nailed to a post or cartwheel and a knife\r\nput in his hand, he had to free himself by cutting off his ear, to pay\r\na fine, and to forswear the town. In 1470, 12_d._ was paid “for nailing\r\nof Thomas Norys his ear.” (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 525, 530.)\r\n\r\n[421] Hist. MSS. Com. viii. 407. Nottingham retained the old usage\r\ntill after the fourteenth century; Records, i. 175. Exeter till 1581;\r\nFreeman’s Exeter, 119. The question may have partly turned on the form\r\nof government adopted in the town and the work required of the common\r\nassembly in which the burghers voted.\r\n\r\n[422] It has been argued (Gneist, Constit. Communale, tr. Hippert, i.\r\n263; v. 275) that the State created local government in the towns as a\r\nmethod of developing better administration, and that it was therefore\r\nonly accidentally and as a secondary consequence that independence and\r\nlocal liberties came in the wake of this administrative system. The\r\nfacts, however, of their story make it perfectly clear that municipal\r\nliberties were of natural growth, and sprang out of local needs rather\r\nthan out of Court statecraft.\r\n\r\n[423] Gross, i. 23; ii. 115.\r\n\r\n[424] The seals of English towns of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and\r\nfifteenth centuries were of finer workmanship than any in Europe. They\r\ngenerally represented a fortress or walled town, a ship, a patron\r\nsaint, or heraldic arms, but it is interesting that in no case is the\r\nfigure of the Mayor used to typify the borough save in the London seal,\r\nwhere he stands among the corporation and citizens. Sometimes a bridge\r\nis given, as at Barnstaple; in two or three cases the Guild Hall.\r\n\r\n[425] A few towns, in the case of some members of the Cinque Ports,\r\ndepended on another borough.\r\n\r\n[426] For the position of tenants on ancient demesne, see Vinogradoff,\r\nVillainage in England, ch. iii. Mr. Maitland (Select Pleas in Manorial\r\nCourts, ii. 99, &c.) gives an account of King’s Ripton, a manor on\r\nancient demesne, whose tenants when transferred to the Abbey of Ramsey\r\nwere always fighting with their new lords as to the services due from\r\ntheir holdings. “The privileged nature of the tenure had engendered a\r\nprivileged race, very tenacious of its land and of its customs” (p.\r\n105). The study of the way in which the customs of ancient demesne\r\naffected the later constitution of the boroughs lies outside my\r\nsubject, and is therefore merely indicated.\r\n\r\n[427] Vinogradoff, Villainage in England, 89. Compare the claim of\r\nBristol to be “founded and grounded upon franchises, liberties, and\r\nfree ancient customs, and not upon common law.” (Ricart’s Kalendar, 2.)\r\nFor its liberties, see p. 24-5.\r\n\r\n[428] As a matter of fact the various towns of this kind which applied\r\nto Hereford for any information as to its customs on any point had to\r\npay one hundred shillings for the answer vouchsafed to them. (Journ.\r\nArch. Ass. xxvii. 470.)\r\n\r\n[429] There was constant watchfulness on both sides as to their rights.\r\nIn 1400 the bailiffs of Ipswich granted land for the building of a mill\r\nfor the benefit of the corporation; the King’s officers declared the\r\ngrant to have been made without the royal licence, and the mill was\r\nseized for the King. On the other hand, when the sheriff of the county\r\narrested a felon in the liberties of Ipswich and put him in the King’s\r\njail, the bailiffs required that he should be given up to them. (Hist.\r\nMSS. Com. ix. 231, 246.)\r\n\r\n[430] That is on the plea of lack of justice in the borough court. In\r\n1401, when the citizens of Canterbury were summoned by the Crown to\r\nappear at Westminster about a breach of the statutes for the regulation\r\nof the victualling trades, they pleaded that by their charter they\r\ncould not be called to answer civil suits out of their own city. (Hist.\r\nMSS. Com. ix. 167.)\r\n\r\n[431] In 1299 the amercements ordered by the Leet Court of Norwich\r\namounted to £72 18s. 10d.; the amount accounted for by the collectors\r\nwas £17 0s. 2d. (Hudson’s Leet Jurisd. of Norwich, Selden Soc. xl.)\r\nWhere there was profit to be made the King was, however, always on the\r\nalert. In Piers Ploughman, Passus v., 169, he complains bitterly of\r\nthe lawyers; “through your law I believe I lose my escheats!”; and it\r\nwas often late before he made the mayor escheator. In 1492 two Scotch\r\npriests were arrested in Ipswich for treasonable talk, and the King\r\ngranted their chattels to one of his own serjeants. The bailiffs sent\r\nthe Town Clerk to Henry to represent that the forfeited goods of felons\r\nrightly belonged to the town; to which the King answered that he would\r\nnot for a thousand pounds infringe in the least degree their charters,\r\nbut that the community had really no right to these particular\r\nchattels, since the priests, being Scotch and not the King’s subjects,\r\ncould not fairly be accused of treason, and had a perfect right to talk\r\nas they chose. On this plea he kept the goods. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix.\r\n247.)\r\n\r\n[432] This was strictly enforced, and the town charter forfeited if\r\nthe rent fell into arrears. (Madox, 139, 161-2.) The towns therefore\r\nmade careful provision for the discharge of the debt, sometimes\r\nsetting apart a mill or some valuable property for its payment (Madox,\r\nFirma Burgi, 251-2; Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 198-9; Nott. Rec. i. 313), or\r\nassigning certain tolls or customs; (Shillingford’s Letters, 92); or\r\ncollecting it as rent from house to house. (Custumal in Hist. Preston\r\nGuild, 75.)\r\n\r\n[433] When the ferm of Carlisle was raised from £60 to £80 the citizens\r\nwere granted, as a help towards its payment, all fines, inflicted by\r\nthe King’s judges within their walls. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 198, 200.)\r\nSee also Norwich Documents, 16, 17.\r\n\r\n[434] Thus the Nottingham men paid 13_s._ 4_d._ a year to Henry the\r\nSixth, at least from 1454, for liberties granted them. There is no\r\nentry of this in the King’s accounts, and the only evidence of it is\r\nin the Nottingham Records (iii. 133). The loyal theory of Hereford was\r\nthat “our goods and chattels are to be taken and taxed at his pleasure,\r\nsaving unto ourselves a competent quantity for our sustentation and\r\ntuition of our city.” (Journ. Arch. Ass. xxvii. 471.)\r\n\r\n[435] Nott. Rec. i. 225, 227, 413, 421.\r\n\r\n[436] The agreement made in the fourteenth century which fixed the\r\ntenths and fifteenths for the towns at a permanent fixed sum, made it\r\neasy for the King to give over to local officials the levying of this\r\ntax without fear of injury to the Exchequer. (Stubbs, ii. 599, 600.)\r\n\r\n[437] Blomefield, iii. 137.\r\n\r\n[438] The Admiral and his deputy had jurisdiction over everything done\r\non the sea and the great rivers up to the first bridge. (13 Richard\r\nII. St. 1, cap. 5; 15 Richard II., cap. 3; Blomefield, iii. 103;\r\nDavies’ Southampton, 239-40.) In 1487 the commonalty of Ipswich by a\r\ncovenant with the King bound themselves to take surety of every owner,\r\nmaster, or purser of every English ship to twice the value of the\r\nship, that the mariners should keep the peace on the sea; that if the\r\nsurety by any means became less than twice the value of ship, tackle,\r\nand victuals, new security should be taken; and that the town should\r\nstrive to arrest every robber and spoiler in the sea or the streams\r\nthereof. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 259-60.) In 1463 a charter was given to\r\nthe corporation of York, constituting them the King’s justiciaries\r\nfor overlooking and preserving the main rivers of Yorkshire. For the\r\nexpenses and difficulties which this involved, see Davies’ York, 59-63,\r\n82, &c.\r\n\r\n[439] As an illustration of his difficulties, see the statute allowing\r\nsheriffs and escheators to remain for four years in office, because\r\nowing to pestilence and wars there was not a sufficiency of persons to\r\noccupy these offices. (9 Henry V. St. 1, cap. 5.)\r\n\r\n[440] In the lack of officials to carry out the regulations for\r\nthe control of trade a number of private people got royal letters\r\nappointing them surveyors and correctors of victuallers in various\r\ncities and boroughs, and freely used their privileges for extortion and\r\noppression, and the taking of heavy fines and ransoms; their patents\r\nwere gradually withdrawn; and in 1472 an Act was passed that all such\r\nletters and patents should be void, and that the duty of searching and\r\nsurveying victuals should rest wholly with the mayor or bailiff. (12\r\nEdward IV. cap. 8.)\r\n\r\n[441] In this matter the King was not allowed to interfere. In 1489\r\nthere was a dispute in Leicester between the Town Council and the\r\nCommons about the election of a Mayor. The matter was referred to the\r\nKing, who issued a precept under the seal of the Duchy of Lancaster,\r\nshowing that it was as Lord of the Manor and not as King that he\r\ninterfered. He set aside both candidates and reappointed the last\r\nMayor. The next year the question was settled by Act of Parliament.\r\n(Thomson, Mun. Hist., 84.) For authority exercised by Parliament see\r\nNorwich (Doc. Stanley _v._ Mayor, &c. 30.) When the citizens applied\r\nin 1378 to the King and Council for a renewal of their ancient liberty\r\nthat no stranger should have power to buy or sell by retail, they\r\nwere answered that it would not be valid “without Parliament”; they\r\ntherefore pray for a grant by charter.\r\n\r\n[442] See Hudson’s Leet Jur. in Norwich, Selden Soc. xxvii. xc. “For\r\nhe doth represent to us the body of our King.” (Journ. Arch. Ass.\r\nxxvii. 462.) See the proclamation of the London Mayor: “We do command,\r\non behalf of our Lord the King, that no dyer or weaver shall be so\r\ndaring,” &c. —”Memorials of London,” p. 309. An illustration of how\r\nthe King’s law and the town law ran side by side may be seen in the\r\nfines for the breach of certain rules, as, for instance, the rule\r\nagainst liveries, which had to be paid both to the King and to the\r\ntown. (English Guilds, 388-9.)\r\n\r\n[443] Piers Ploughman, Passus ii. 156, 157.\r\n\r\n[444] Warkworth’s Chronicle, 2.\r\n\r\n[445] See Gross, ii. 245.\r\n\r\n[446] The instances of similar grants made to various towns at almost\r\nthe same date are too numerous to give, but they would form a striking\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n[447] Charter of Lincoln the same year; that of Winchester, 1190.\r\n(Stubb’s Charters, 257-8).

In the great majority\r\nof cases this grant was made once for all; but occasionally it was\r\nrenewed from time to time. Thus Henry the Sixth in 1437 gave the mayor\r\nand burgesses of Bristol a lease of the town and its profits for a\r\nterm of twenty years. In 1446 he granted a new lease for sixty years.\r\nIn 1461 Edward the Fourth renewed the lease, not for a term of years,\r\nbut for ever. (Seyer’s Charters of Bristol, 105.) The ferm was granted\r\nin the same way for a term of years in the case of Dunwich, a royal\r\ntown, where it was let out to the highest bidder. Here, however, the\r\ncollection of rent was peculiarly uncertain from special circumstances\r\n(Madox, 235-8, 241); and in 1325 Dunwich, ruined by the filling up of\r\nits port, prayed to have the town taken into the King’s hand and a\r\nguardian appointed.

In 1489 there was some such trouble in Leicester (Thompson,\r\nMun. Hist., 84). And in 1512 there is another instance in Nottingham\r\n(Records, iii. 341-2). From the time of Richard the Third there seems\r\nevidence of the growth of a new anxiety in the central government\r\nabout the democratic movement in the boroughs, and a determination to\r\nreserve power in the hands of a small corporation. An earlier instance\r\nmay perhaps be found in the Exeter quarrel from 1477 to 1482 (English\r\nGuilds, 305, &c.); and in York in 1482 (Davies, 122-4).\r\n\r\n[470] There were many cases in which a town’s privileges were\r\nforfeited, whether for arrears of rent (Madox, 139, 161-2) or for\r\nother causes (154-5, 157). The franchises of Nottingham were twice\r\nforfeited for some unknown cause—in 1283 for three years (Records,\r\ni. 56), and in 1330 for a short time. (Ibid. 102.) In the same year\r\nEdward the First seized the franchises of Derby because of exactions\r\nof the Merchant Guild, but restored them on payment of a fine. (Gross,\r\nii. 53.) For the case of Sandwich (Boys, 661, 676). Ipswich charter\r\nwithdrawn, 1285; regranted, 1291. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 230, 239, 243.)\r\nChester in 1409. (Hemingway’s Chester, i. 137.) The liberties of\r\nCarlisle were forfeited for a short time for some irregularity in the\r\ntown courts in the thirteenth century. (Gross, ii. 38.) Southampton\r\nlost its freedom in 1276 and 1285, and again in the next century for\r\nletting the French into the town. (Davies’ Southampton, 33, 35, 79.)\r\nNorwich suffered several times; for its attack on the Priory in 1272;\r\nfor an accusation of having exceeded its powers in punishing crime in\r\n1286; for riots about the election of mayor in 1437; and for Gladman’s\r\ninsurrection in 1443. (Stanley _v._ Mayor, &c., Norwich Doc., 9-12.\r\nProceedings, Privy Council, v. 45. Hist. MSS. Com. i. 103.) In these\r\ncases a royal officer was appointed to rule the town; and the complaint\r\nof Scarborough, when Edward the Second in 1324 deprived it of the\r\nright of direct payment to the Exchequer, shows how a town suffered\r\nwhen its ferm was leased out. (Rot. Parl. i. 423.) The loss of liberty\r\nwas always temporary, lasting from a few months to five or six years,\r\nand had no political significance as in France, where it formed part\r\nof a settled policy and had results which to the English mind seem of\r\npeculiar importance in the history of constitutional development.\r\n\r\n[471] Gross, ii. 235-243.\r\n\r\n[472] Occasionally a borough was granted to a great noble or court\r\nfavourite; but more commonly as time went on the grant merely meant\r\ngiving a charge on the rent of the town. Thus before 1339 Preston had\r\nbeen granted at various times to neighbouring lords. In 1361 John of\r\nGaunt held the manor, but long before this the rights of the lord were\r\nso reduced that they are practically never mentioned in the history of\r\nthe town. (Hewitson’s History of Preston, 7-8.) For the troubles to\r\nwhich the nobles’ claims to rent might lead, see Davies’ Southampton,\r\n112. Edward the Fourth granted the ferm of Bristol to the Queen for her\r\nlife. The treasurer of the King’s chamber declared it had been assigned\r\nto him in payment of a debt and brought an action for it against the\r\nBristol sheriff. Bristol proved the money had been paid to the Queen\r\nand gained the case, 1465. (Madox, 227-8.)\r\n\r\n[473] In 1273 Henry de Tracy held the borough from the King in chief\r\nat a ferm of about £5 14_s._ 2_d._ There were 36 tenants whose rent\r\namounted to 23_s._ 8_d._ and some tenants in a suburb who paid an\r\nuncertain rent, but generally about 6_s._ 8_d._ A market was held every\r\nFriday which yielded in tolls to the lord about £3 a year, and a yearly\r\nfair gave 10_s._ Fines, reliefs, &c., came to about 13_s._ 4_d._ a\r\nyear. The wealth of the town increased after the building of the “Long\r\nBridge” in 1280 over “the great hugy, mighty, perylous, and dreadful\r\nwater named Taw,” and the increase of the cloth trade about 1321.\r\nTowards the close of the fourteenth century the legacies and accounts\r\nshow that the burghers were laying up considerable wealth and doing a\r\nthriving trade.

(Madox, Firma Burgi, 42.) The King could grant a number of\r\nprivileges which were beyond the power of any other lord—such as\r\nfreedom from tolls throughout the kingdom, exemption from the sheriff’s\r\njurisdiction, freedom from interference of royal officers, and so on;\r\nand the matter of tolls was so important that towns on private estates\r\nwere practically obliged to get a royal charter as well as a charter\r\nfrom their lord.

From the towns these evils seem to have been rigorously and\r\neffectually banished by ordinances from 1309 (Freeman’s Exeter, 165,\r\n143) throughout the two following centuries. (Hist. MSS.

Its great\r\ncharter given by Edmund Crouchback in 1277, and translated into English\r\nunder Henry the Sixth, was mainly concerned with the ordering of legal\r\nprocedure for the burghers; and it was not till 1376 that the town\r\nbought from its earl the right to appoint its own bailiff, and to\r\nreceive the annual profits of its courts, and various other dues and\r\nfines. The town property was simply a tenement, a chamber, and a small\r\nplace yielding a few pence yearly till 1393, when it was allowed to\r\nhold a little property for the repair of the bridges; and not till 1435\r\nwere the mayor and the corporation given the right to acquire lands and\r\nrents for the sustenation of the town and mayoralty. (Hist. MSS. Com.\r\nviii. 404, 412, 413, 414. Thompson, Mun. Hist., 74. A pamphlet on the\r\nOrigin of the Leicester Corporation by J. D. Paul gives a translation\r\nof Crouchback’s charter.) Doncaster belonged to the family of De\r\nMauley till the middle of the fifteenth century, when it passed for a\r\nfew years to the Duke of Northumberland, and in 1461 was taken into\r\nthe possession of the Crown. Edward the Fourth made it a free borough\r\nand gave it a common seal. Henry the Seventh in 1505 granted to the\r\ncorporation all the property which the Crown had acquired at Doncaster\r\non the attainder of Percy in 1461, and for a yearly rent of £74 13_s._\r\n11½_d._ secured to it the rights which had belonged to the ancient\r\nfeudal lords.

From this time leases of the ferm were very\r\nnumerous and were constantly granted to one or more individuals;\r\nbetween 1354 and 1374 Richard de Aynesargh and William Adamson, who\r\nwere often mayors, took such leases for several terms.

Ibid. i. 31-2. Picton’s Mun.\r\nRecords, i. 20.\r\n\r\n[509] The revenue from Liverpool in 1296 was £25: it then had 168\r\ninhabited houses. (Picton’s Mem. of Liverpool, i. 20.) In 1342 the\r\npersonalty of the burgesses taxed was £110 13_s._ 3_d._, that is, the\r\naverage personalty of each was about one mark (25). The revenue in 1327\r\nwas £30; in 1346 it was £38 (26), and remained the same in 1394 (31).\r\nIn 1444 it was reduced to £21; in 1455 to £17 16_s._ 8_d._; and under\r\nEdward the Fourth to £14 (36-7). In 1515 an inquiry was made as to the\r\ndecay of the revenue (38), and the Act of 1544 put Liverpool in the\r\nlist of towns which had wholly fallen into decay (45). Two plagues,\r\none in 1540, another in 1548, probably carried off half its population\r\n(47); and in 1565 it had but 138 inhabited houses, and probably seven\r\nor eight hundred inhabitants, and twelve vessels navigated on an\r\naverage by six men each (55). There were five streets under Edward the\r\nThird, and seven under Elizabeth (62).\r\n\r\n[510] Fortified in 1406. Picton’s Mun.

In 1305, however,\r\nthe burghers, rather than pay tallage to the bishop, surrendered their\r\nmunicipal privileges to the King, and promised to give up to him their\r\ncommon seal. (Rot. Parl. i. 174-6.) But in the composition made the\r\nnext year between the lord bishop and the citizens, those who had\r\nshared in the revolt and had not made their submission were utterly\r\nseparated and removed from privileges of trade or government. (Gross,\r\nii. 209-10.) In 1396 there was again a quarrel between the bishop and\r\nthe citizens, and the case was carried to the King’s Council, when the\r\nmayor and commonalty entered into a recognizance to the King in £20,000\r\nto behave well to the bishop, and two hundred of the citizens entered\r\ninto recognizances to the bishop, each one in the sum of £1,000. In\r\nthe agreement, however, certain provisions were made to prevent the\r\necclesiastics from taking advantage in any way of this treaty. (Madox,\r\n142.)\r\n\r\nThe Commons in giving the grant of 1435 pray that no prelate may be a\r\ncollector, adding that the dioceses of bishops and the neighbourhood of\r\nabbeys were greatly oppressed by ecclesiastical lords.

The townsmen also\r\nbrought their common seal of silver, which at their request was\r\ndestroyed and the silver given to the shrine of St. Alban. (Madox,\r\n140.) Common as it was in France for a commune to renounce its freedom,\r\nthere is scarcely any instance in England save on ecclesiastical\r\nproperty. The case of Dunwich was peculiar and I have met with no other.\r\n\r\n[551] Occasionally a convent drove a hard bargain. In 1440 an\r\nagreement was made between the convent of Plimpton and the commonalty\r\nof Plymouth, by which the commonalty was to pay £41 yearly, and if\r\nthis rent was unpaid fifteen days after quarter day, the officers of\r\nthe convent might seize all the goods and chattels of the mayor and\r\ncommonalty and of any burgesses and of any others residing and abiding\r\nthere which could be found within the borough and the precinct thereof.\r\nMadox, 222-3.\r\n\r\n[552] The organization of the guild does not seem to have been at\r\nall of a democratic or “advanced” kind, but after the pattern of the\r\noligarchic societies of the time. Four men owning goods to the value of\r\n10 marks were elected yearly, by a committee of twelve burgesses, to\r\nhold the guild, and summoned to do their duty by two officers of the\r\nguild called “les Dyes.”\r\n\r\n[553] Gross, ii. 29-36.

For example, there were nineteen bridges within the limits of\r\nthe borough, which after the dissolution of the monastery fell into\r\ndecay and were repaired in the time of Elizabeth with the stones from\r\nthe abbey walls. (Coates’s Reading, 64.) But material advantages did\r\nnot take the place of political freedom.\r\n\r\n[561] Gross, i., 90-1. The number of burghers in the Guild seems to\r\nhave been very small. In 1486, 28 burghers paid _chepin gavell_; in\r\n1487, 22 burgesses; and in 1490-93, 31 burgesses. In 1510 there were\r\n45 burgesses. (Coates’s Reading, 58.) There were many who paid fines\r\nand dues to the abbot who were of the town and not of the Guild, and\r\nthis class was doubtless encouraged by the convent, following the same\r\npolicy as the bishop in Lynn. (Hist. MSS. Com. xi. part 7, 172, 175-6.)\r\n\r\n[562] The Guilds were naturally looked on with very little favour by\r\nthe ecclesiastical lords in such cases. There was a conflict between\r\nabbot and town at Malmesbury in the time of Edward the First. The\r\nburghers claimed to have a Guild of their own people, who alone had a\r\nright to trade in the town, and to take certain taxes for the support\r\nof the Guild from all traders who were not of it. The abbot refused to\r\nallow them to use their rights. The town fell back on its liberties\r\n_when it had been a royal borough_, and appealed to the King. (Gross,\r\nii. 173.)

Compare Norwich, Blomefield,\r\niii. 62. In Canterbury the murder of a citizen by a waggoner of the\r\npriory in 1313 gave rise to a hot dispute as to the jurisdiction of\r\nthe city coroner. The Convent refused him admittance within the priory\r\ngates, smuggled in an alien coroner to view the body, and then had it\r\nburied by the prior’s grooms. The story is given in an Inspeximus of\r\nRichard the Second; Muniments of Canterbury.\r\n\r\n[664] The distribution of taxes was a matter of special arrangement in\r\nthe different towns. By the request of the canons the ecclesiastical\r\ntenants at Grimsby were not tallaged with the burgesses (Madox, 270).\r\nIn Leicester the tenants of the Bishop’s Fee just without the walls did\r\nsuit and service to the Bishop of Lincoln; a compromise had been made\r\nin 1281 by which it was decided that the Bishop’s tenants should share\r\nin certain common expenses, and should in return enjoy the franchises\r\nand free customs which had been won by the Merchant Guild of Leicester;\r\nbut while the burgesses had to bear the charges both of “the community\r\nof the town,” and “the community of the guild,” the bishop’s tenants\r\nonly paid for such matters as touched “the community of the guild,”\r\nand were not liable for the general town taxes. (Gross, ii. 140-1.)\r\nAs early as 1189 the Guild of Nottingham obtained the right to raise\r\ncontributions to the ferm rent from tenants of all fees whatsoever. In\r\nNorwich this was given in 1229 (Norwich Doc., Stanley _v._ Mayor, etc.,\r\n5, 6). But the question of collection still remained a burning one, and\r\nthe itinerant justices having failed in 1239 to settle matters between\r\nthe convent and the city, the King himself went to Norwich to insist on\r\nan agreement in 1241.

John in Worcester refused to\r\naid in tallages, to submit to the assize of bread and beer, under the\r\ntown’s officers, and to keep watch and ward. In 1221 they were ordered\r\nto do all these things. (Select Pleas of the Crown, Selden Soc. p.\r\n97.) In 1331 Norwich resisted the handing over of three houses to the\r\nprior and convent “for that a very great part of the same city which\r\nis inhabited, is in the hands of the prior and convent and of other\r\nreligious persons, whereby the inhabitants are at their distress, and\r\ncannot be tallaged to the tallages and aids of the lord the King and of\r\nthe city aforesaid as tenants should be, nor can they be in assizes,\r\njuries, and recognizances, whereby others dwelling in the same city are\r\nburdened and grieved more than usual by such gifts and assignments.”\r\n(Norwich Documents, Stanley _v._ Mayor, pr. 1884, 24, 25).\r\n\r\n[671] Shillingford’s Letters, 44-45.\r\n\r\n[672] Ibid. 52.\r\n\r\n[673] Shillingford’s Letters, 91-2, 104-5.\r\n\r\n[674] Ibid. 92.\r\n\r\n[675] Ibid. 100, 109.\r\n\r\n[676] Shillingford’s Letters, 84-5, 99.\r\n\r\n[677] In Canterbury also the Convent was bent on getting possession of\r\nthat part of the covered way which lay along its territory, and the\r\ncity wall itself so far as it touched the Cathedral precincts. Their\r\nfirst step was taken in 1160, and their final success was not assured\r\ntill 1492, when the city resigned to the Convent the wall and covered\r\nway between Burgate and Northgate with the waste land adjoining, and\r\nthe chapter was allowed to make a postern and to build a bridge across\r\nthe foss. Such an arrangement was of course only possible at a time\r\nwhen peace with France, and the close of civil wars and riots at home\r\nhad freed the town from danger of siege or revolution. (Lit.

The chamberlain’s accounts give the costs of\r\none visit to London of mayor and aldermen on business of the town.\r\nThree counsel were paid 10_s._; one of them “in the cloister at Paul’s\r\nwhen he corrected the copy,” got 3_s._ 4_d._ and his clerk 12_d._ The\r\nmayor gathered together all the witnesses in a house beside Paul’s to\r\nrehearse their evidence “against they came into the Star Chamber,” and\r\npaid for bread and drink and house room for them 16_d._ At Westminster\r\nHall the three counsel got 3_s._ 4_d._ each, and for the three days\r\nfollowing the same fees were daily paid. In the Star Chamber Master\r\nRoydon paid for examination of sixteen persons at 2_s._ 4_d._ a man,\r\n37_s._ 4_d._; two days after fees were again paid to two counsel, and a\r\nbreakfast given to Sir Matthew Browne. Master Fisher was paid for the\r\nfees of the Hilary term 19_s._ Warrants of attorney cost 4_s._, and\r\ncopies of the panels 2_s._ The counsel had to be looked up in their\r\ncountry houses, and messengers were always crossing Tilbury Ferry to\r\nlook for “Master Raimond,” and give him a retaining fee “to be our\r\ncounsel,” or going to Finchley to seek “Master Frowick,” perhaps to\r\nfind that “he was then ridden to Walsingham, so the said Thomas came to\r\nLondon homeward again.” The Master Recorder of London was met coming to\r\nthe Temple and besought “to be good master to the city,” and retained\r\nat a cost of 6_s._ 8_d._ with a breakfast to his servants in Fleet\r\nStreet. Then a messenger waited at the Guild Hall for the recorder, and\r\nagain watched for him “the same day at afternoon at Milord Dawbeny’s\r\nplace, there waiting till the said Master Recorder had supped, and when\r\nhe came out we besought him to speed us, for the time of the forfeit\r\npassed not three days; which answered that he was sore occupied and\r\nmight not entende it so shortly, where we took him 6_s._ 8_d._, and\r\nthen he bade us wait on him on the morrow in the Temple. The next day\r\nwhen Mr. Recorder had contrived the bill and corrected it, for his\r\nreward 6_s._ 8_d._ Paid for a pike given to Master Mordaunt 3_s._\r\n4_d._” The mayor then sent to Canterbury to direct that some gift\r\nshould be sent up which might be used in “making friends”; and several\r\nmembers of the Common Council travelled up with two trouts (one trout\r\ncost about 10_s._) and ten capons. The witnesses examined in the Star\r\nChamber each got 6_s._ 8_d._ and their travelling expenses; after\r\ntheir examination they adjourned to the buttery for an entertainment,\r\nand paid “in reward to the officers of the King’s buttery for their\r\ngood cheer 12_d._ and to the cook of the King’s kitchen 8_d._” Besides\r\nall this there was a great deal of feasting and drinking in eight of\r\nthe London inns, in Southwark, Cheap, Fleet Street, Paul’s Chain, and\r\nHolborn.

The Custumals of Dover, Sandwich, Romney,\r\nRye, and Winchelsea, are given in Lyon’s Dover, ii. 267-387.\r\n\r\n[725] The Ports with corporate members were:—Hastings: (Seaford,\r\nPevensey). Sandwich: (Fordwich, Deal). Dover: (Folkestone, Faversham).\r\nRomney: (Lydd). Rye: (Tenterden). Hastings had six non-corporate\r\nmembers; Sandwich six; Dover seven; Romney four; and Hythe one; each of\r\nwhich was governed by a Deputy sent by the head Port.\r\n\r\n[726] Dover had always remained in the King’s hands, but Hythe and\r\nRomney belonged to the Archbishop, while Sandwich had been given to\r\nChrist Church, Canterbury, and Hastings, Winchelsea, and Rye had\r\nbeen handed over to the Abbey of Fécamp. A few details about the\r\nrelations of Fécamp to its possessions at Hastings, Winchelsea, and\r\nRye, may be found in Leroux de Lincy’s Abbaye de Fécamp, pp. 289,\r\n294, 300, 327, 331; and a notice of the tax called _aletot_ which\r\nwas paid by the inhabitants of Rye to Fécamp, p. 299. The two parish\r\nchurches of Hastings, being part of the alien priory of Fécamp, were\r\nnever appropriate or belonging either to the College of S. Mary or\r\nto the Priory. They were afterwards granted away by Henry the Eighth\r\n(Horsfield’s Hastings, i. 448). The Counts of Eu held the Castle with\r\nthe whole of the rape of Hastings and the manor till their estates were\r\nforfeited by rebellion about 1245 and given by Henry the Third to his\r\nson Edward. Moss’ Hastings, 3-4, 63.\r\n\r\n[727] There was a considerable change in the century that followed the\r\ncomplete political separation of England from the Continent. Henry the\r\nThird got back Rye and Winchelsea, and at least the Castle of Hastings\r\nif not more; and Edward the First Sandwich; while Hythe and Romney\r\nremained with the Archbishop.\r\n\r\n[728] For rights possessed in the time of Henry the Second see Hist.\r\nMSS. Com. v. 454.\r\n\r\n[729] Confirmed by Edward the First, 1293. Rot. Parl. i. 101. There\r\nwere no coroners in the Cinque Ports except the mayors of the various\r\ntowns.

(Boys’ Sandwich, 697, 771.) A mayor of Sandwich accused\r\nof assaulting the sheriff’s bailiff refused to answer except at the\r\nCourt of Shepway. (Ibid. 661.)\r\n\r\n[731] Lyon’s Dover, ii. 304.

The Cinque Ports joined\r\nSimon de Montfort against the King. Possibly this revolt was due to\r\nthe limits fixed to their territory by Henry in 1259-60, for a little\r\nlater the Barons’ party extended those limits. (Ibid. 107.) It was in\r\nthis war too that they finally secured freedom from summons before the\r\nKing’s Justices.\r\n\r\n[734] Boys’ Sandwich, 445. “Within the Cinque Ports there is no trial\r\nby jury as in other places.” Ibid. 452.

The renewal of\r\nthese charters on one occasion cost Hythe £17 as its share. (Hist. MSS.\r\nCom. v. 535, 537.) These payments were over and above the sums which\r\nhad to be given for the charters of each separate Port, and which were\r\nalso a heavy cost.\r\n\r\n[740] Hist. MSS. Com. v. 545.\r\n\r\n[741] Ibid. 525, 494, 517-18, 520.\r\n\r\n[742] The usual number was four or five. Lyon’s Dover, i. 251. Romney\r\nsent six. Ibid. ii. 342.

Parl. i. 32, 332.\r\n\r\n[752] Every year a letter was sent to each Port asking “whether a\r\nBrotherhood or Guestling is necessary to be arreared this year,” and\r\nwhen the common consent was given the summonses were issued. Burrows’\r\nCinque Ports, 177.\r\n\r\n[753] Hist. MSS. Com. iv. i. 427.\r\n\r\n[754] These four bailiffs aided by a provost chosen by the Yarmouth\r\ncommonalty, took over the keys of the prison, issued all ordinances and\r\nheld pleas. This went on till 1663. (See Hist. MSS. Com. v. 553, 533,\r\n535, 539-43.) Boys’ Sandwich, 576-7. But the question of the Yarmouth\r\nfair gradually declined in importance, and in the fifteenth century\r\nbecame relatively of so little consequence that the Brodhull decreed in\r\n1515 that the yearly report of their bailiffs sent to Yarmouth might be\r\ndispensed with. (Lyon’s Dover i. xii.)\r\n\r\n[755] Lyon’s Dover i. iv. v.\r\n\r\n[756] It was already well established in the fourteenth century, and\r\npossibly much earlier, that orders of the Court of Shepway as to the\r\ntaxes required for the King or for the general purposes of the Ports\r\nbecame the basis of agreements made between the Ports at the Brodhull\r\nconcerning the share of taxes to be paid by each Port. See Burrows’\r\nCinque Ports, 180-1.\r\n\r\n[757] In 1412 a curious agreement between the mariners of France and\r\nEngland was signed by Romney and Lydd, and probably by all the ports\r\nfrom Southampton to Thanet. It provided that if any master or mariner\r\nwere captured the only ransom to be asked on either side should be six\r\nnobles for the master and three for the mariner with 20 pence a week\r\nboard for each; a fishing boat with nets and tackles was to be set\r\nfree for 40 pence; any man taken on either coast should be charged no\r\nransom, but a gentleman or merchant who was taken might be charged any\r\nransom that his captor chose. In case of any dispute, arbitrators were\r\nappointed; if these were disobeyed 100_s._ was to be paid on one side\r\nto S. Nicholas at Romney, on the other side to the Church of Hope All\r\nSaints. (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 537-538.) The arrangement as to the place\r\nof payment of the fine was doubtless different in each town of the\r\nleague. The common serjeant of Hythe in the same year rode to Dover\r\nto get a copy of the composition for his own town. In a disputed case\r\nwhen the plaintiff and defendant seem to have been of Romney, questions\r\ntouching the “Law of Oleron,” _i.e._, the Law Maritime, were decided\r\n“by the judgment of the masters of ships and boats of the vills of\r\nHastings, Winchelsea, Sandwich, and Dover,” that is, a majority of the\r\nseven towns. (Hist. MSS. Com. vi. 543.)\r\n\r\n[758] At any time the court might be summoned to redress a wrong, and\r\nnot only the jurats and commonalty of a town but any aggrieved person\r\nwhatever in the whole confederation might claim that a Brodhull should\r\nbe summoned if he was wronged on any point touching the charters,\r\nusages, or franchises of the Ports. Burrows’ Cinque Ports, 181.\r\n\r\n[759] Ibid. 177-8. The Guestling sometimes sat separately for special\r\nbusiness, generally perhaps at Winchelsea, for the affairs of the three\r\nSussex Ports. For an instance in 1477 see Hist. MSS. Com. v. 489.\r\n\r\n[760] Moss’s Hastings, 21. The importance of the Guestling Court\r\ngradually declined and in 1601 the Brotherhood Court (then near its\r\nown extinction) passed a decree that the yearly Guestling might be\r\nabolished. Lyon’s Dover i. xii.\r\n\r\n[761] Hist. MSS. Com. v. 539.\r\n\r\n[762] Burrows (Cinque Ports, 238) suggests that Lydd, like the supposed\r\ncase of Faversham, might have owed its incorporation under a mayor and\r\njurats to the Court of Shepway. He does not give any reasons for this\r\nsupposition. Lydd was under the Archbishop; Faversham under the abbot\r\nuntil the suppression of the abbey. Ibid. 234.\r\n\r\n[763] Dover and Sandwich were the first of the Ports to have a mayor,\r\nthe mayors of Sandwich being continuous from 1226. Then came Rye and\r\nWinchelsea about 1297. The other three, Hastings, Hythe, and Romney,\r\nwere ruled by bailiffs till the time of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[764] For goods imported into Sandwich see Boys, 435-9, 658-9. Iron was\r\nbrought from Spain and Cologne and wine from Genoa; all kinds of skins,\r\nand furs, with silk, spices, and frankincense from the Levant. For the\r\ntaxes on merchandise, cellars, and warehouses see Hist. MSS. Com. v.\r\n458. Under Edward the Third it fitted out for the King’s service 22\r\nships with 504 mariners.

Ibid.\r\n669.\r\n\r\n[766] In 1422 an agreement was made that the corporation should go in\r\nand out on the quay freely, and use the monks’ gate, “to provide for\r\nthe guard and the defence of the town.” The ground along the quay was\r\nto be deemed a highway. Ibid. 671.\r\n\r\n[767] Under a patent of white wax because Sandwich would not obey an\r\nExchequer patent under green wax. Boys, 441, 404, 435-457.\r\n\r\n[768] Literæ Cant., i. 46-48. In 1324 the convent however repeated the\r\noffence. Ibid. 118-120.\r\n\r\n[769] Boys’ Sandwich, 435.\r\n\r\n[770] Pleas of the Crown were held at Sandown in a place called the\r\nMastez either on the Monday of the Hundred Court or any other Monday.\r\nIbid. 443.\r\n\r\n[771] Ibid. 457.\r\n\r\n[772] Ibid. 311, 501. The mayor is the judge and gives such judgment as\r\nhe thinks proper, whereas the bailiff has nothing further to do with\r\nthe business than to receive the amercements. Ibid. 459.\r\n\r\n[773] Boys’ Sandwich, 527. See also 450.\r\n\r\n[774] Ibid. 510, 536-7.\r\n\r\n[775] Hist. MSS. Com. v. 533-4, 535,537, 539,541-2. In 1340 Romney\r\nwas divided into thirteen wards, and 941 persons above fifteen were\r\nassessed to the subsidy granted to the King that year. The whole sum\r\nassessed was £48 9_s._ 6_d._ Forty-five persons were assessed in Old\r\nRomney at 43_s._ 6_d._ The receipts from taxes, rents, etc., in 1381\r\nseem to have been nearly £180. (Boys, 799-801.) Romney seems to have\r\ncome to the height of its prosperity about 1386. One barge was built\r\n1386; one in 1396; one in 1400; one hired in 1420. (Ibid. 535-40.)\r\n\r\n[776] This was an old family in the town, for in 1314-15 complaint was\r\nmade that Hugh Holyligebroke and the community were sheltering and\r\ndefending robbers and felons so that the country could not get justice\r\non them. Rot. Parl. i. 324.\r\n\r\n[777] Hist. MSS. Com. v. 535-42.\r\n\r\n[778] Ibid. 535-42.\r\n\r\n[779] Ibid. vi. 543-4.\r\n\r\n[780] Hist. MSS. Com. iv.

MSS. Com. v. 534, 535, 539, 543, 544.\r\n\r\n[783] The twelve jurats were summoned by the common horn to assemble\r\nfor business in the parish church until they hired a room in 1410 to\r\nhold their meetings and to store the goods of the community; in 1421\r\nthey built or repaired a common house with thatched roof and glass\r\nwindows, an exchequer table covered with green cloth, and a bell to\r\nring for the election of jurats. A book of customs was probably drawn\r\nup under Richard the Second, a small seal made in 1389, and a bell in\r\n1424. Hist. MSS.

In the fifteenth\r\ncentury the Archbishop sometimes appointed the bailiff of Hythe, and\r\nsometimes leased out the appointment to the town for a term of years.\r\nCranmer leased it out for ninety-nine years. It only got a mayor under\r\nElizabeth. (Burrows’ Cinque Ports, 215, 217-218; Hist. MSS. Com. iv. i.\r\n434, 429. Boys’ Sandwich, 811.)

In Rye there is\r\nan entry of 19_s._ 3_d._ for the expenses of the mayor, bailiff, common\r\nclerk and four jurats at Dover, “going and returning on carrying the\r\nmen’s quarters, when the mayor and bailiff with four jurats were sent\r\nunder the heaviest penalty, and on pain of contempt of our lord the\r\nKing.” Another two pence was spent in giving them a drink of malmsey\r\nbefore dinner (Hist. MSS Com. v. 492, 493); and the same year “the\r\nmen of the Lord Warwick entered the town with a strong band and took\r\ndown the quarter of the man and buried it in the churchyard.” In 1470\r\nRomney and the other Cinque Ports supported Warwick against Edward,\r\n1469-70.
