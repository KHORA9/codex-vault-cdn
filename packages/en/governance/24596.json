BARNES,\r\n  In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States\r\n              for the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Thirty-Ninth Congress is a sequel to that of the\r\nRebellion. This having been overthrown, it remained for Congress to\r\nadminister upon its effects. It depended upon the decisions of\r\nCongress whether the expected results of our victories should be\r\nrealized or lost.\r\n\r\nNow that the work of the Thirty-Ninth Congress stands forth complete,\r\npeople naturally desire to know something of the manner in which the\r\nrough material was shaped into order, and the workmanship by which the\r\nwhole was \"fitly joined together.\" It can not be said of this fabric\r\nof legislation that it went up without \"the sound of the hammer.\" The\r\nrap of the gavel was often heard enforcing order or limiting the\r\nlength of speeches.\r\n\r\nDiscussion is the process by which legislation is achieved; hence no\r\nhistory of legislation would be complete without presenting the\r\nprogress of debate preparatory to the adoption of important measures.\r\nThe explanation of what our legislators did is found in what they\r\nsaid. Debates, as presented in the following pages, are by necessity\r\nmuch abridged. No attempt has been made to give a summary or synopsis\r\nof speeches. That which seemed to be the most striking or\r\ncharacteristic passage in a speech is given, in the words of the\r\norator.\r\n\r\nMany things said and done in the Thirty-Ninth Congress, of great\r\nimportance to the nation, are by necessity omitted. The reader, in\r\nforming his opinion of Congressional character and ability, will bear\r\nin mind that those who speak most frequently are not always the most\r\nuseful legislators. Men from whom no quotation is made, and to whom no\r\nmeasure is attributed in the following pages, may be among the\r\nforemost in watchfulness for their constituents, and faithfulness to\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nIf it should seem that one subject -- the negro question -- occupied\r\ntoo much of the time and attention of Congress, it must be borne in\r\nmind that this subject was thrust upon Congress and the country by the\r\nissue of the Rebellion, and must be definitely and finally settled\r\nbefore the nation can be at rest. \"Unsettled questions have no pity on\r\nthe repose of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to present a journal of Congressional\r\nproceedings, giving a detail of what was said and done from day to day\r\nin the Senate and the House. There was always some great national\r\nquestion under consideration in one or the other House, forming an\r\nuninterrupted series of discussions and transactions. To present these\r\nin review is to give a history of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, since\r\nthey distinguish it from all its predecessors, and make it historical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.--Opening Scenes.\r\n\r\n  (Page 13-21.)\r\n\r\n     Momentous Events of the Vacation -- Opening of the Senate --\r\n     Mr. Wade --

SCHUYLER COLFAX,\r\n\r\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Congress that has just passed away has written a record that will\r\nbe long remembered by the poor and friendless, whom it did not forget.\r\nMisrepresented or misunderstood by those who denounced it as enemies,\r\nharshly and unjustly criticised by some who should have been its\r\nfriends, it proved itself more faithful to human progress and liberty\r\nthan any of its predecessors. The outraged and oppressed found in\r\nthese congressional halls champions and friends. Its key-note of\r\npolicy was protection to the downtrodden. It quailed not before the\r\nmightiest, and neglected not the obscurest. It lifted the slave, whom\r\nthe nation had freed, to the full stature of manhood. It placed on our\r\nstatute-book the Civil Rights Bill as our nation's magna charta,\r\ngrander than all the enactments that honor the American code; and in\r\nall the region whose civil governments had been destroyed by a\r\nvanquished rebellion, it declared as a guarantee of defense to the\r\nweakest that the freeman's hand should wield the freeman's ballot; and\r\nthat none but loyal men should govern a land which loyal sacrifices\r\nhad saved. Taught by inspiration that new wine could not be safely put\r\nin old bottles, it proclaimed that there could be no safe or loyal\r\nreconstruction on a foundation of unrepentant treason and disloyalty.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the Thirty-ninth Congress proposed, as their plan\r\nof Reconstruction, a Constitutional Amendment. It was a bond of public\r\njustice and public safety combined, to be embodied in our national\r\nConstitution, to show to our posterity that patriotism is a virtue and\r\nrebellion is a crime. These terms were more magnanimous than were ever\r\noffered in any country under like circumstances. They were kind, they\r\nwere forbearing, they were less than we had a right to demand; but in\r\nour anxiety, in our desire to close up this question, we made the\r\nproposition. How was it received? They trampled upon it, they spat\r\nupon it, they repudiated it, and said they would have nothing to do\r\nwith it. They were determined to have more power after the rebellion\r\nthan they had before.\r\n\r\nWhen this proposition was repudiated, we came together again, at the\r\nsecond session of the same Congress, to devise some other plan of\r\nreconstruction in place of the proffer that had been spurned. We put\r\nthe basis of our reconstruction, first, upon every loyal man in the\r\nSouth, and then we gave the ballot also to every man who had only been\r\na traitor. The persons we excluded, for the present, from suffrage in\r\nthe South, were not the thousands who struggled in the rebel army, not\r\nthe millions who had given their adhesion to it, but only those men\r\nwho had sworn allegiance to the Constitution and then added to treason\r\nthe crime of perjury.\r\n\r\nThough we demand no indemnity for the past, no banishment, no\r\nconfiscations, no penalties for the offended law, there is one thing\r\nwe do demand, there is one thing we have the power to demand, and that\r\nis security for the future, and that we intend to have, not only in\r\nlegislation, but imbedded in the imperishable bulwarks of our national\r\nConstitution, against which the waves of secession may dash in future\r\nbut in vain. We intend to have those States reconstructed on such\r\nenduring corner-stones that posterity shall realize that our fallen\r\nheroes have not died in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nOPENING SCENES.\r\n\r\n     Momentous Events of the Vacation -- Opening of the Senate --\r\n     Mr. Wade -- Mr. Sumner -- Mr. Wilson -- Mr. Harris -- Edward\r\n     McPherson -- As Clerk of the preceding Congress, he calls\r\n     the House to order -- Interruption of Roll-call by Mr.\r\n     Maynard -- Remarks by Mr. Brooks -- His Colloquy with Mr.\r\n     Stevens -- Mr. Colfax elected Speaker -- His Inaugural\r\n     Address -- The Test Oath.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thirty-ninth Congress of the United States, convened in the\r\nCapitol at Washington on the fourth of December, 1865. Since the\r\nadjournment of the Thirty-eighth Congress, events of the greatest\r\nmoment had transpired--events which invested its successor with\r\nresponsibilities unparalleled in the history of any preceding\r\nlegislative body.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln, sixteenth President of the United States, had been\r\nslain by the hand of the assassin. The crime had filled the land with\r\nhorror. The loss of its illustrious victim had veiled the nation in\r\nunaffected grief.\r\n\r\nBy this great national calamity, Andrew Johnson, who on the fourth of\r\nMarch preceding had taken his seat simply to preside over the\r\ndeliberations of the Senate, became President of the United States.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the civil war, which had been waged with such terrible\r\nviolence and bloodshed for four years preceding, came to a sudden\r\ntermination. The rebel armies, under Generals Lee and Johnston, had\r\nsurrendered to the victorious soldiers of the United States, who in\r\ntheir generosity had granted to the vanquished terms so mild and easy\r\nas to excite universal surprise.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, Alexander H. Stephens, and some other leaders in the\r\nrebellion, had been captured and held for a time as State prisoners;\r\nbut, at length, all save the \"President of the Confederate States\"\r\nwere released on parole, and finally pardoned by the President.\r\n\r\nThe President had issued a proclamation granting amnesty and pardon to\r\n\"all who directly or indirectly participated in the rebellion, with\r\nrestoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves,\" on\r\ncondition of their subscribing to a prescribed oath. By the provisions\r\nof this proclamation, fourteen classes of persons were excepted from\r\nthe benefits of the amnesty offered therein, and yet \"any person\r\nbelonging to the excepted classes\" was encouraged to make special\r\napplication to the President for pardon, to whom clemency, it was\r\ndeclared, would \"be liberally extended.\" In compliance with this\r\ninvitation, multitudes had obtained certificates of pardon from the\r\nPresident, some of whom were at once elected by the Southern people,\r\nto represent them, as Senators and Representatives, in the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress.\r\n\r\nThe President had further carried on the work of reconstruction by\r\nappointing Provisional Governors for many of the States lately in\r\nrebellion. He had recognized and entered into communication with the\r\nLegislatures of these States, prescribing certain terms on which they\r\nmight secure representation in Congress, and recognition of \"all their\r\nrights under the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nBy these and many other events which had transpired since the\r\nexpiration of the preceding Congress, the legislation pertaining to\r\nreconstruction had become a work of vast complexity, involving\r\nprinciples more profound, and questions more difficult, than ever\r\nbefore presented for the consideration and solution of men assembled\r\nin a legislative capacity.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock on the day designated in the Constitution for the\r\nmeeting of Congress, the Senate assembled, and was called to order by\r\nHon. Lafayette S. Foster, President pro tempore. Senators from\r\ntwenty-five States were in their seats, and answered to their names.\r\nRev. E. H. Gray, Chaplain of the Senate, invoked the blessing of\r\nAlmighty God upon Congress, and prayed \"that all their deliberations\r\nand enactments might be such as to secure the Divine approval, and\r\ninsure the unanimous acquiescence of the people, and command the\r\nrespect of the nations of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the preliminary formalities of opening the Senate had\r\ntranspired, Benjamin F. Wade, Senator from Ohio, inaugurated the\r\nlabors of the Thirty-ninth Congress, and significantly foreshadowed\r\none of its most memorable acts by introducing \"a bill to regulate the\r\nelective franchise in the District of Columbia.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate signified its willingness to enter at once upon active duty\r\nby giving unanimous consent to Mr. Sumner, Senator from Massachusetts,\r\nto introduce a number of important bills. The measures thus brought\r\nbefore the Senate were clearly indicative of the line of policy which\r\nCongress would pursue. The bills introduced were designed \"to carry\r\nout the principles of a republican form of government in the District\r\nof Columbia;\" \"to present an oath to maintain a republican form of\r\ngovernment in the rebel States;\" \"to enforce the amendment to the\r\nConstitution abolishing slavery;\" \"to enforce the guarantee of a\r\nrepublican form of government in certain States where governments have\r\nbeen usurped or overthrown.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Wilson, of Massachusetts, was not behind his distinguished\r\ncolleague in his readiness to enter upon the most laborious\r\nlegislation of the session. He introduced \"a bill to maintain the\r\nfreedom of the inhabitants in the States declared in insurrection by\r\nthe proclamation of the President on the first of July, 1862.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Harris, of New York, long known as one of the ablest jurists\r\nof his State, and recently an eminent member of the Senate's Judiciary\r\nCommittee, directed attention to his favorite field of legislative\r\nlabor by introducing \"a bill to reörganize the Judiciary of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Senate was thus actively entering upon the labors of the\r\nsession, a somewhat different scene was transpiring in the other end\r\nof the Capitol.\r\n\r\nLong before the hour for the assembling of Congress, the halls, the\r\ngalleries, and corridors of the House of Representatives were thronged\r\nwith such crowds as had never before been seen at the opening of a\r\nsession. The absorbing interest felt throughout the entire country in\r\nthe great questions to be decided by Congress had drawn great numbers\r\nto the Capitol from every quarter of the Union. Eligible positions,\r\nusually held in reserve for certain privileged or official persons,\r\nand rarely occupied by a spectator, were now filled to their utmost\r\ncapacity. The Diplomatic Gallery was occupied by many unskilled in the\r\nmysteries of diplomacy; the Reporters' Gallery held many listeners and\r\nlookers on who had no connection with newspapers, save as readers. The\r\n\"floor\" was held not only by the \"members,\" who made the hall vocal\r\nwith their greetings and congratulations, but by a great crowd of\r\npages, office-seekers, office-holders, and unambitious citizens, who\r\nthronged over the new carpet and among the desks.\r\n\r\nThe hour having arrived for the assembling of Congress, Edward\r\nMcPherson, Clerk of the last House of Representatives, brought down\r\nthe gavel on the Speaker's desk, and called the House to order. The\r\nmembers found their seats, and the crowd surged back up the aisles,\r\nand stood in a compact mass in the rear of the last row of desks.\r\n\r\nEdward McPherson, who at that moment occupied the most prominent and\r\nresponsible place in the nation, had come to his position through a\r\nseries of steps, which afforded the country an opportunity of knowing\r\nhis material and capacity. A graduate of Pennsylvania College in 1848,\r\neditor, author, twice a Congressman, and Clerk of the House of\r\nRepresentatives in the Thirty-eighth Congress, he had given evidence\r\nthat he was reliable. Having shown himself a thoroughly conscientious\r\nman in the performance of all his public duties, the great interests\r\nof the nation were safe in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe country had been greatly concerned to know how the Clerk would\r\nmake up the Roll of the House, and whether the names of members elect\r\nfrom the late rebellious States would be called at the opening of the\r\nsession. If this should be done, the first step would be gained by the\r\nRepresentatives of those States toward holding seats in Congress to\r\nwhich the majority at the North considered them not entitled. It had\r\neven been intimated that the color of constitutionality which they\r\nwould gain from recognition by the Clerk would be used to justify an\r\nassertion of their claims by force. What the Clerk would do, as master\r\nof the rolls and presiding officer of the House, was not long in\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk proceeded to call the roll of Representatives elect, while\r\nthe subordinates at the desk took note of the responses. He called the\r\nnames of Congressmen from the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,\r\nMassachusetts, and so forth, in a certain order which had been\r\ncustomary time immemorial in naming the States. In this order\r\nTennessee had place after Kentucky and before Indiana. When the name\r\nof the last Representative from Kentucky had been called, the decisive\r\nmoment arrived. The delegation from Tennessee were on the floor, ready\r\nto answer to their names. The Clerk passed over Tennessee and went\r\ndirect to Indiana. As soon as the first member from Indiana had\r\nresponded, there arose a tall, black-haired, dark-faced figure, that\r\nevery body recognized as Horace Maynard, of Tennessee. He shook his\r\ncertificate of election at the Clerk, and began to speak, but the\r\ngavel came down with a sharp rap, and a firm, decided voice was heard\r\nfrom the desk, \"The Clerk declines to have any interruption during the\r\ncall of the roll.\" The roll-call then proceeded without further\r\ninterference to the end. When, at last, the Clerk had finished his\r\nlist of Representatives and Territorial Delegates, Mr. Maynard once\r\nmore arose. \"The Clerk can not be interrupted while ascertaining\r\nwhether a quorum is present,\" says the presiding officer. The count of\r\nthe assistants having been completed, the Clerk announced, \"One\r\nhundred and seventy-six members having answered to their names, a\r\nquorum is present.\" Mr. Morrill immediately moved that the House\r\nproceed to the election of Speaker. \"Before that motion is put,\" said\r\nMr. Maynard, again arising. The Clerk was ready for the emergency, and\r\nbefore Mr. Maynard could complete his sentence, he uttered the\r\nimperative and conclusive words, \"The Clerk can not recognize as\r\nentitled to the floor any gentleman whose name is not on this roll.\" A\r\nbuzz of approbation greeted the discreet ruling of the Clerk. The\r\ndifficult point was passed, and the whole subject of the admission of\r\nSouthern Representatives was handed over intact, to be deliberately\r\nconsidered after the House should be fully organized for business.\r\n\r\nMr. Morrill, in moving to proceed to the election of a Speaker, had\r\nforgotten or neglected to demand the previous question, and thus cut\r\noff debate. Mr. James Brooks, most plausible in address, and most\r\nready in talk on the side of the minority, saw the point left\r\nunguarded by his opponents, and resolved to enter. Born in Maine, now\r\na citizen of New York, and editor of the \"Express,\" Mr. Brooks was in\r\nCongress for the fourth time a champion of what he deemed the rights\r\nof the South, and not in accordance with the prevailing sentiments in\r\nhis native and adopted States.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks obtained the floor, and desired to amend the motion. He\r\nthought the roll should be completed before proceeding to the election\r\nof Speaker. \"I trust,\" said he, \"that we shall not proceed to any\r\nrevolutionary, any step like that, without at least hearing from the\r\nhonorable gentleman from Tennessee. If Tennessee is not in the Union,\r\nby what right does the President of the United States usurp his place\r\nin the White House when an alien and a foreigner, and not from a State\r\nin the Union?\"\r\n\r\nAt this stage, a man of mark--five times a Representative in Congress,\r\nbut now twelve years away from the capital and a new member--John\r\nWentworth, of Chicago--elevated his tall and massive form, and with a\r\nstentorian voice called Mr. Brooks to order. The Clerk having fairly\r\ndecided that gentleman entitled to the floor on the question of\r\nproceeding to the election of a Speaker, Mr. Wentworth sat down, and\r\nMr. Brooks in resuming his remarks improved his chance to administer\r\nrebuke in a manner which provoked some mirth. \"When the honorable\r\ngentleman from Illinois is better acquainted with me in this House,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Brooks, \"he will learn that I always proceed in order, and\r\nnever deviate from the rules.\" Mr. Brooks then returned to his\r\nchampionship of Mr. Maynard: \"If he is not a loyal man, and is not\r\nfrom a State in this Union, what man, then, is loyal? In the darkest\r\nand most doubtful period of the war, when an exile from his own State,\r\nI heard his eloquent voice on the banks of the St. Lawrence arousing\r\nthe people of my own State to discharge their duties to the country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks joined Virginia with Tennessee, and asked the Clerk to give\r\nhis reasons for excluding the names of Representatives from these\r\nStates from the roll. The Clerk replied that he had acted in\r\naccordance with his views of duty, and was willing to let the record\r\nstand; if it was the desire of the House to have his reasons, he would\r\ngive them.\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessary,\" said Thaddeus Stevens; \"we know all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" replied Mr. Brooks, \"that it is known to all in one quarter,\r\nbut that it is not known to many in other quarters in this House, why\r\nthis exclusion has been made. I should know but little, if I had not\r\nthe record before me of the resolution adopted by the Republican\r\nmajority of this House, that Tennessee, Louisiana, and Virginia were\r\nto be excluded, and excluded without debate. Why without debate? Are\r\ngentlemen afraid to face debate? Are their reasons of such a character\r\nthat they dare not present them to the country, and have to resort to\r\nthe extraordinary step of sideway legislation, in a private caucus, to\r\nenact a joint resolution to be forced upon this House without debate,\r\nconfirming that there are no reasons whatever to support this position\r\nexcept their absolute power, and authority, and control over this\r\nHouse? If the gentleman from Pennsylvania would but inform me at what\r\nperiod he intends to press this resolution, I would be happy to be\r\ninformed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I propose to present it at the proper time,\" was the response of Mr.\r\nStevens, provoking laughter and applause.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks replied: \"Talleyrand said that language was given to man to\r\nconceal ideas, and we all know the gentleman's ingenuity in the use of\r\nlanguage. The proper time! When will that be?\" Mr. Brooks then\r\nproceeded at some length to answer this question. He supposed the\r\nproper time would be as soon as the House was organized, and before\r\nthe President's message could be heard and considered, that the action\r\nof the House might silence the Executive, and nullify the exposition\r\nwhich he might make, and become a _quasi_ condemnation of the action\r\nof the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks was at length ready to close, and sought to yield the floor\r\nto a Democratic member. The Republicans, however, were ready to meet\r\nthe emergency, and objected to the floor being yielded in such a way\r\nas would cause delay without furthering the business of organizing the\r\nHouse. Points of order were raised, and efforts made to entangle the\r\nClerk, but in vain. His rulings were prompt, decisive, and effectual.\r\nThe moment a Republican fairly held the floor, the previous question\r\nwas moved, the initial contest was over, and the House proceeded to\r\nelect a Speaker.\r\n\r\nA stoop-shouldered, studious-looking gentleman, now for the sixth\r\nsuccessive term a member of Congress--Justin S. Morrill, of\r\nVermont--arose and nominated Schuyler Colfax, of Indiana. On the other\r\nside of the house, a gentleman from New York portly in his person, now\r\nentering on his second Congressional term--Charles H. Winfield--nominated\r\nJames Brooks, of New York. Four members took their seats behind the\r\nClerk to act as tellers. The responses were at length all given, and\r\nthe numbers noted. Mr. Morrill, one of the tellers, announced the\r\nresult--\"Mr. Colfax, one hundred and thirty-nine; Mr. Brooks,\r\nthirty-six.\" The Clerk formally announced the result, and stepped\r\naside; his work as presiding officer of the Thirty-ninth Congress was\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\nIn the place thus made vacant appeared the man but a moment before\r\nelected to the position by the largest political majority ever given\r\nto a Speaker of the House. A well-proportioned figure of medium size,\r\na pleasing countenance often radiant with smiles, a style of movement\r\nquick and restless, yet calm and self-possessed, were characteristic\r\nof him upon whom all eyes were turned. In the past a printer and\r\neditor in Indiana, now in Congress for the sixth term and elected\r\nSpeaker the second time, SCHUYLER COLFAX stood to take the oath of\r\noffice, and enter upon the discharge of most difficult and responsible\r\nduties. He said:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The reässembling of\r\nCongress, marking as it does the procession of our national history,\r\nis always regarded with interest by the people for whom it is to\r\nlegislate. But it is not unsafe to say that millions more than ever\r\nbefore, North, South, East, and West, are looking to the Congress\r\nwhich opens its session to-day with an earnestness and solicitude\r\nunequaled on similar occasions in the past. The Thirty-eighth Congress\r\nclosed its constitutional existence with the storm-cloud of war still\r\nlowering over us, and after nine months' absence, Congress resumes its\r\nlegislative authority in these council halls, rejoicing that from\r\nshore to shore in our land there is peace.\r\n\r\n\"Its duties are as obvious as the sun's pathway in the heavens.\r\nRepresenting in its two branches the States and the people, its first\r\nand highest obligation is to guarantee to every State a republican\r\nform of government. The rebellion having overthrown constitutional\r\nState governments in many States, it is yours to mature and enact\r\nlegislation which, with the concurrence of the Executive, shall\r\nestablish them anew on such a basis of enduring justice as will\r\nguarantee all necessary safeguards to the people, and afford what our\r\nMagna Charta, the Declaration of Independence, proclaims is the chief\r\nobject of government--protection to all men in their inalienable\r\nrights. The world should witness, in this great work, the most\r\ninflexible fidelity, the most earnest devotion to the principles of\r\nliberty and humanity, the truest patriotism and the wisest\r\nstatesmanship.\r\n\r\n\"Heroic men, by hundreds of thousands, have died that the Republic\r\nmight live. The emblems of mourning have darkened White House and\r\ncabin alike; but the fires of civil war have melted every fetter in\r\nthe land, and proved the funeral pyre of slavery. It is for you,\r\nRepresentatives, to do your work as faithfully and as well as did the\r\nfearless saviors of the Union in their more dangerous arena of duty.\r\nThen we may hope to see the vacant and once abandoned seats around us\r\ngradually filling up, until this hall shall contain Representatives\r\nfrom every State and district; their hearts devoted to the Union for\r\nwhich they are to legislate, jealous of its honor, proud of its glory,\r\nwatchful of its rights, and hostile to its enemies. And the stars on\r\nour banner, that paled when the States they represented arrayed\r\nthemselves in arms against the nation, will shine with a more\r\nbrilliant light of loyalty than ever before.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Colfax having finished his address, took the following oath, which\r\nstood as the most serious obstacle in the way of many elected to\r\nCongress from the Southern States:\r\n\r\n     \"I do solemnly swear that I have never voluntarily borne\r\n     arms against the United States since I have been a citizen\r\n     thereof; that I have voluntarily given no aid, countenance,\r\n     counsel, or encouragement to persons engaged in armed\r\n     hostility thereto; that I have neither sought nor accepted\r\n     nor attempted to exercise the functions of any office\r\n     whatever, under any authority or pretended authority in\r\n     hostility to the United States; that I have not yielded a\r\n     voluntary support to any pretended government, authority,\r\n     power, or constitution within the United States, hostile or\r\n     inimical thereto. And I do further swear that, to the best\r\n     of my knowledge and ability, I will support and defend the\r\n     Constitution of the United States against all enemies,\r\n     foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and\r\n     allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely,\r\n     without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and\r\n     that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the\r\n     office on which I am about to enter. So help me God!\"\r\n\r\nThe subordinate officers were then elected by resolution, and the\r\nHouse of Representatives being organized, was ready to enter upon its\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLOCATIONS OF THE MEMBERS AND CAST OF THE COMMITTEES.\r\n\r\n     Importance of surroundings -- Members sometimes referred to\r\n     by their seats -- Senator Andrew Johnson -- Seating of the\r\n     Senators -- Drawing in the House -- The Senate-chamber as\r\n     seen from the Gallery -- Distinguished Senators -- The House\r\n     of Representatives -- Some prominent characters --\r\n     Importance of Committees -- Difficulty in their appointment\r\n     -- Important Senate Committees -- Committees of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe localities and surroundings of men have an influence on their\r\nactions and opinions. A matter which, to the casual observer, seems so\r\nunimportant as the selection and arrangement of the seats of Senators\r\nand Representatives, has its influence upon the legislation of the\r\ncountry. Ever since parties have had an existence, it has been\r\nconsidered of vital moment that those of one political faith in a\r\ndeliberative body should occupy, as nearly as possible, the same\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes of service to a reader, in attempting to understand\r\nthe reported proceedings of Congress, to know the localities of the\r\nmembers. Each seat has a sort of history of its own, and becomes in\r\nsome way identified with its occupant. Members are frequently alluded\r\nto in connection with the seats they occupy. Sometimes it happens\r\nthat, years after a man has gone from Congress, it is convenient and\r\nsuggestive to refer to him by his old place in the chamber. As an\r\nillustration, Mr. Trumbull, in his speech on the veto of the Civil\r\nRights Bill, desiring to quote Andrew Johnson, Senator, against Andrew\r\nJohnson, President, referred to \"a speech delivered in this body by a\r\nSenator occupying, I think, the seat now occupied across the chamber\r\nby my friend from Oregon (Mr. Williams).\"\r\n\r\nA necessary and important part of the adjustment of the machinery, at\r\nthe opening of each Congress, is the selection of seats. As the\r\nSenators serve for six years, and many of them have been reëlected\r\nmore than once, there are comparatively few changes made at the\r\nopening of any Congress. The old members generally choose to retain\r\ntheir accustomed seats, and the small number that come in as new\r\nSenators choose among the vacant seats, as convenience or caprice may\r\ndictate.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives the formality of drawing for seats is\r\nnecessary. That this may be conveniently and fairly done, at the\r\nappointed time all the members retire to the antechambers, leaving the\r\nseats all unoccupied. The Clerk draws at random from a receptacle\r\ncontaining the names of all the members. As the members are called,\r\none by one, they go in and occupy such seats as they may choose. The\r\nunlucky member whose name last turns up has little room for choice,\r\nand must be content to spend his Congressional days far from the\r\nSpeaker, on the remote circumference, or to the right or left extreme.\r\n\r\nThere are in the Senate-chamber seventy seats, in three tiers of\r\nsemi-circular arrangement. If all the old Southern States were\r\nrepresented by Senators on the floor, the seats would be more than\r\nfull. As it was in the Thirty-ninth Congress, there were a number of\r\nvacant desks, all of them situated to the right and left of the\r\npresiding officer.\r\n\r\nIn a division of political parties nearly equal, the main aisle from\r\nthe southern entrance would be the separating line. As it was, the\r\nRepublican Senators occupied not only the eastern half of the chamber,\r\nbut many of them were seated on the other side, the comparatively few\r\nDemocratic Senators sitting still further to the west.\r\n\r\nSeated in the gallery, the spectator has a favorable position to\r\nsurvey the grand historic scene which passes below. His eye is\r\nnaturally first attracted to the chair which is constitutionally the\r\nseat of the second dignitary in the land--the Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States. That office, however, has no incumbent, since he who\r\ntook oath a few months before to perform its duties was called to\r\noccupy a higher place, made vacant by a most atrocious crime. The\r\nevent, however, cost the Senate little loss of dignity, since the\r\nchair is filled by a President _pro tempore_ of great ability and\r\nexcellence--Lafayette S. Foster, Senator from Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThe eye of the spectator naturally seeks out Charles Sumner, who sits\r\naway on the outer tier of seats, toward the south-east corner of the\r\nchamber; and near him, on the left, are seen the late Governors, now\r\nSenators, Morgan and Yates, of New York and Illinois. Immediately in\r\nfront of them, on the middle tier of seats, is an assemblage of old\r\nand distinguished Senators--Trumbull, Wilson, Wade, and Fessenden. To\r\nthe right of the Vice-President's chair, and in the row of seats\r\nneares this desk, sits the venerable and learned lawyer, Reverdy\r\nJohnson, of Maryland. Just in his rear sits the youthful Sprague, of\r\nRhode Island, to whose right is seen Sherman, of Ohio. To the rear of\r\nthese Senators, in the outer segment of seats, sits, or perhaps\r\nstands, Garrett Davis, of Kentucky, the most garrulous of old men,\r\ncontinually out of temper with the majority, yet all the time marked\r\nby what he calls his \"usual courtesy.\" To the left of Davis, beyond\r\nNesmith, of Oregon, and the other and more silent Senator from\r\nKentucky, sits Saulsbury, of Delaware, unless he should be traversing\r\nthe carpeted space in the rear of his seat, like a sentinel of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nFar different is the sight presented to the spectator who looks down\r\nfrom the galleries of the House of Representatives. The immense area\r\nbelow is supplied with two hundred and fifty-three seats, with desks\r\narranged in semi-circular rows, having a point in front of the\r\nSpeaker's desk as a focus. On the right of the spectator, as he looks\r\nfrom the gallery in front of the Speaker, is the Republican side of\r\nthe House. But this prosperous organization has grown so rapidly since\r\nits birth, ten years ago, that it has overstepped all old and\r\ntraditional party limitations. One-half of the House is not sufficient\r\nto afford its representatives adequate accommodations. Republican\r\nmembers have passed over the main aisle, and occupy half of the\r\nDemocratic side, having pressed the thin ranks of their opponents to\r\nthe extreme left.\r\n\r\nAs the spectator scans the House, his eye will rest on Thaddeus\r\nStevens, whose brown wig and Roman cast of countenance mark the\r\nveteran of the House. He sits in the right place for a leader of the\r\nRepublicans, about half-way back from the Speaker's desk, on the\r\ndiagonal line which divides the western side of the House, where he\r\ncan readily catch the Speaker's eye, and be easily heard by all his\r\nfriends. Immediately in his rear is his successor in the chairmanship\r\nof the Committee of Ways and Means--Mr. Morrill, of Vermont. To the\r\nright, across the aisle, is Elihu B. Washburn, of Illinois, the oldest\r\nmember in continuous service in the House; and to his rear is Henry J.\r\nRaymond, of the Times. To the right, and partly in the rear of Mr.\r\nStevens, are a number of noteworthy men: among them are General\r\nSchenck, General Garfield, and \"Long John\" Wentworth, of Chicago. Far\r\naround to the right, and much nearer, the Speaker's desk, is seen a\r\nman distinguished in civil and military history, who once occupied the\r\nSpeaker's chair--General Banks, of Massachusetts. In physical contrast\r\nwith him, sits--in the adjoining desk, a tall, dark, bearded\r\nCalifornian--General John Bidwell, a new member of the House. On the\r\nopposite side of the House, among the Democrats, is the seat of John\r\nA. Bingham, who now returns to Congress after an absence of one term,\r\nwhom his friends describe as the \"best-natured and crossest-looking\r\nman in the House.\" James Brooks, most plausible and best-natured of\r\nDemocrats, notwithstanding the inroads of the Republicans, sturdily\r\nkeeps his seat near the main aisle. His seat, however, he is destined\r\nto lose before many months in favor of a contestant, who will occupy\r\nthe other side of the chamber.\r\n\r\nIn looking down upon so large an assemblage, a large part of which is\r\nso distant, the eye of the spectator will weary in the attempt to\r\ndiscover and recognize individuals, however familiar, amidst the busy\r\nthrong.\r\n\r\nIn preparing for the work of legislation, a matter of more importance\r\nthan the arrangement of the seats is the cast of the committees. Most\r\nof the labor of legislative bodies is done by committees. As it is\r\nimpossible for any one Congressman to give that minute and particular\r\nattention to all the numerous interests demanding legislation,\r\nessential to a wise determination as to what bills should be\r\npresented, and how they should be drawn in every case, the various\r\nsubjects are parceled out among those whose opportunities, interests,\r\nor inclinations have led them to give particular attention to the\r\nmatters committed to their charge. The perfection of legislation on\r\nparticular subjects depends not more on the wisdom of the entire body\r\nof legislators than on the good sense of the committees that\r\ndeliberate upon them. Much of the efficiency and success of the\r\nlegislative acts of Congress will depend upon the structure of the\r\ncommittees that do the laborious work of preparing business for the\r\nbody. Tracing the stream of legislative enactment still nearer to its\r\nsource, it will be found that the work of a committee takes a decided\r\ntinge from the character of its chairman.\r\n\r\nIt consequently becomes a matter of great interest to the country, at\r\nthe opening of each Congress, to know who constitute the committees.\r\nOne of the most arduous and responsible duties of the Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives is the selection of committees and filling\r\ntheir chairmanships. Fitness and special adaptation are supposed to\r\nconstitute the rule by which choice is made. Many elements, however,\r\nenter into the work which are not a part of this philosophy. It is\r\nimpossible that the presiding officer should know unerringly who is\r\nabsolutely the fittest man for any position, and if he possessed such\r\nsuperhuman knowledge he would still be trammeled by long-established\r\nrules of precedence and promotion. There is often a regular gradation\r\nby which men arrive at positions which is not in direct ratio to their\r\nfitness for their places.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the errors which were unavoidable elements in the\r\nwork, committees were never better constituted than those of the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Senate being comparatively small in numbers, and, moreover, by\r\nusage, doing most of the details of this business in caucus, the\r\nannouncement of the committees in this body was made on Wednesday, the\r\nthird day of the session. On the other hand, the size of the House,\r\nthe large proportion of new and unknown members appearing every term,\r\nthe number and magnitude of the committees, and the fact that the duty\r\nof appointment devolved upon the Speaker, combined to render the\r\nreading out of committeemen in the latter body impossible before the\r\nfollowing Monday, one week after the assembling of Congress.\r\n\r\nOf the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Charles Sumner was\r\nappointed chairman. This is a very important committee, being the\r\ndirect channel of communication between the State Department and the\r\nSenate. It being the constitutional duty of the Senate to pass upon\r\nall treaties, and to decide upon qualifications of all persons\r\nnominated by the Executive to represent the United States in foreign\r\ncountries, the labors of this committee are arduous and responsible.\r\nThe chairmanship of this committee was filled by a Senator of most\r\neminent fitness and ability. His literary culture, and attainments as\r\na scholar, his general legal ability and familiarity with the laws of\r\nnations, his residence abroad for several years, and his long\r\nmembership in the Senate, now of fourteen years' duration, all marked\r\nhim as wisely chosen for his important position.\r\n\r\nOn account of the immense National debt accumulated in the war, and\r\nthe complication of the financial affairs of the nation, the Committee\r\non Finance has an important bearing upon the interests of the country,\r\nunknown until recent years. William P. Fessenden was the Senator\r\nchosen chairman of this committee. His success in his private\r\nbusiness, his appointment, in 1864, as the head of the Treasury\r\nDepartment, and his service in the Senate since 1853 as member of the\r\nFinance Committee, and since 1859 as its chairman, all indicated the\r\npropriety of his continuance in this position. Second on the list of\r\nthis committee stood Senator Sherman, of Ohio, who has been described\r\nas \"_au fait_ on National Banks, fond of figures, and in love with\r\nfinances.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Commerce was constituted with Senator Chandler, of\r\nMichigan, as its chairman. Himself most successful in commercial life,\r\nin which he had attained distinction before coming to the Senate, and\r\nrepresenting a State having a greater extent of coast and better\r\nfacilities for commerce than any other inland community in the world,\r\nSenator Chandler was eminently suitable as head of the Committee on\r\nCommerce. His associates being selected from Maine, New York, Vermont,\r\nWisconsin, Kansas, and Oregon, left unrepresented no important\r\ncommercial interest in the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Manufactures was headed by William Sprague, Senator\r\nfrom Rhode Island, a State having the largest capital invested, and\r\nmost persons employed in manufactures, in proportion to population, of\r\nany in the Union. Senator Sprague himself having been educated in the\r\ncounting-room of a manufacturing establishment, and having control of\r\none of the largest manufacturing interests in the country, was the\r\nappropriate person for such a position.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural States of Ohio, Kansas, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and\r\nKentucky furnished the members of the Committee on Agriculture, with\r\nSenator Sherman at its head.\r\n\r\nOf the Committee on the Judiciary, a Senator has given a description.\r\nIn a speech delivered in the Senate, December 12, 1865, Mr. Doolittle,\r\nof Wisconsin, said: \"From its very organization the Senate designs to\r\nmake that committee its constitutional adviser--not that its opinions\r\nare to be conclusive or controlling on the vote of any member of this\r\nbody, like the opinion of the bench of Judges in the House of Lords;\r\nbut its members are chosen in consideration of their high professional\r\nability, their long experience, and well-known standing as jurists, in\r\norder that their report upon constitutional questions may be entitled\r\nto the highest consideration. And, sir, if you look into the\r\norganization of the Judiciary Committee appointed by the Senate at the\r\npresent session, what is it? There is the Senator from Illinois, [Mr.\r\nTrumbull], for years Judge of the Supreme Court of that State before\r\nhe entered this body, who, for ten years and more, has been a\r\nfaithful, laborious, distinguished member of that committee, and for\r\nthe last four years its chairman. And there sits my honorable friend\r\nfrom New York [Mr. Harris], for twenty years before he came here known\r\nand distinguished among the able jurists and judges of that great\r\nState. And there is the honorable Senator from Vermont [Mr. Poland].\r\nHe has, it is true, just entered this body, but his reputation as a\r\njurist preceded his coming, and he comes here to fill the place in\r\nthis chamber, and is put upon this Judiciary Committee to fill the\r\nplace of him of whom I will say, without disparagement to any, that he\r\nwas the ablest jurist of us all--the late distinguished Senator from\r\nVermont [Mr. Collamer]. And there is the Senator from New Hampshire\r\n[Mr. Clark], from the far East, and the Senator from Nevada [Mr.\r\nStewart], from the Pacific coast, and the Senator from Indiana [Mr.\r\nHendricks], from the central region, each of whom stands eminent in\r\nthe profession in the State which he represents, and all of whom are\r\nrecognized here among the ablest jurists of this body.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the great political questions destined to engage the attention\r\nof the Thirty-ninth Congress invested the _Committee on the District\r\nof Columbia_ with a national interest, although its duties pertained\r\nchiefly to the local concerns of the immediate neighborhood of the\r\ncapital. Its chairman, Mr. Morrill, of Maine, as well as its members,\r\namong whom were Wade, Sumner, and Yates, gave it character and\r\nability, and afforded assurance that the great questions involved\r\nwould be calmly met and honestly answered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thaddeus Stevens, representative from Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, the _Committee of Ways and Means_ has\r\never been regarded of first importance, and its chairman has been\r\nconsidered leader of the House. Its duties, though of a somewhat\r\nmiscellaneous character, relate chiefly to devising the ways and means\r\nof raising revenue. The fact that the Constitution provides that \"all\r\nbills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives,\" gives the Committee of Ways and Means a sort of\r\npreeminence over all other committees, whether of the Senate or the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Committee of Ways and Means, as it had existed before\r\nthe Thirty-ninth Congress, was, at the opening of this session,\r\ndivided among three committees; one retaining the old name and still\r\nremaining the leading committee, a second on _Appropriations_, and a\r\nthird on _Banking and Currency_.\r\n\r\nOf the new Committee of Ways and Means, Justin S. Morrill, of Vermont,\r\nwas appointed chairman--a Representative of ten years' experience in\r\nthe House, who had seen several years of service on the same\r\ncommittee. While his abilities and habits, as a student and a thinker,\r\nwell adapted him for the work of conducting his committee by wise\r\ndeliberation to useful measures, yet they were not characteristics\r\nfitting him with readiest tact and most resolute will to \"handle the\r\nHouse.\"\r\n\r\nThaddeus Stevens, the old chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means,\r\nwas appointed the head of the new Committee on Appropriations. His\r\nvigilance and integrity admirably fitted him for this position, while\r\nhis age made it desirable that he should be relieved of the arduous\r\nlabors of the Committee of Ways and Means. Of this committee he had\r\nbeen chairman in the two preceding Congresses, and had filled a large\r\nspace in the public eye as leader of the House. His age--over seventy\r\nyears--gave him the respect of members the majority of whom were born\r\nafter he graduated at college--the more especially as these advanced\r\nyears were not attended with any perceptible abatement of the\r\nintellectual vivacity or fire of youth. The evident honesty and\r\npatriotism with which he advanced over prostrate theories and policies\r\ntoward the great ends at which he aimed, secured him multitudes of\r\nfriends, while these same qualities contributed to make him many\r\nenemies. The timid became bold and the resolute were made stronger in\r\nseeing the bravery with which he maintained his principles. He had a\r\nhabit of going straight to the issue, and a rugged manner of\r\npresenting his opinions, coupled with a cool assurance, which, one of\r\nhis unfriendly critics once declared, \"sometimes rose almost to the\r\nsublime.\" He alone, of all the members of the Pennsylvania Convention,\r\nin 1836, refused to sign the new State Constitution, because it robbed\r\nthe negro of his vote. It was a fitting reward that he, in 1866,\r\nshould stand in the United States House of Representatives, at the\r\nhead of a majority of more than one hundred, declaring that the\r\noppressed race should enjoy rights so long denied.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Banking and Currency had as chairman Theodore M.\r\nPomeroy, of New York, who had served four years in Congress. Perhaps\r\nits most important member was Samuel Hooper, a Boston merchant and\r\nfinancier, who, from the outset of his Congressional career, now\r\nentering upon the third term, had been on the Committee of Ways and\r\nMeans, of which he still remained a member, the only Representative\r\nretaining connection with the old committee and holding a place in one\r\nof the new offshoots from it.\r\n\r\nHiram Price, of Iowa, was appointed chairman of the Committee on the\r\nPacific Railroad. The Speaker of the House, in his recent visit to the\r\nPacific coast, had been impressed with the importance of this work,\r\nand wisely chose as members of this committee Representatives from\r\nPennsylvania, Minnesota, Massachusetts, New York, Missouri, Kansas,\r\nCalifornia, and Oregon.\r\n\r\nA committee of much importance to Congress and the country--that of\r\nCommerce--had for its chairman Elihu B. Washburn, of Illinois, who had\r\nbeen in the previous Congress the oldest member in continuous service,\r\nand hence was styled \"Father of the House.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Elections subsequently lost some of its importance in\r\nthe public estimation by the creation of a special committee to\r\nconsider subjects of reconstruction and the admission of Southern\r\nmembers; yet the interests confided to it demanded ability, which it\r\nhad in its chairman, Henry L. Dawes, of Massachusetts, as well as in\r\nthe Representatives that constituted its membership.\r\n\r\nThe legislation relative to our vast unoccupied domain, having to pass\r\nthrough the Committee on Public Lands, renders this committee one of\r\nmuch importance. The honesty and ability of its chairman, George W.\r\nJulian, of Indiana, together with his long experience in Congress,\r\ngave to the recommendations of this committee great character and\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nOf the Committee on the Judiciary, James F. Wilson, of Iowa, was\r\nappointed for the second time as chairman. George S. Boutwell, of\r\nMassachusetts, and other Representatives of ability, were appointed as\r\nmembers of this committee. Since the duty devolved upon it of taking\r\ntestimony in regard to the impeachment of the President, this\r\ncommittee attracted public attention to a degree never known before.\r\n\r\nThe interests of manufactures were not likely to suffer in the hands\r\nof a committee in which the first place was held by James K. Moorhead,\r\ntanner's apprentice, and pioneer of cotton manufactures in\r\nPennsylvania, and the second by Oakes Ames, a leading manufacturer of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nAgriculture--the most gigantic material interest in America--was\r\nintrusted to a committee having John Bidwell, of California, as its\r\nchairman, and members chosen from Iowa, Indiana, Vermont, Ohio,\r\nKentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York.\r\n\r\nThe chairmanship of the Committee on Military Affairs was bestowed\r\nupon a major-general of volunteers from Ohio, Robert C. Schenck; while\r\nmembership on the committee was given to a Connecticut colonel, Henry\r\nC. Deming; a New Hampshire brigadier-general, Gilman Marston; a\r\nKentucky major-general, Lovell H. Rousseau; a New York Colonel, John\r\nH. Ketchum, and four civilians.\r\n\r\nNathaniel P. Banks, Henry J. Raymond, and other men of much ability,\r\nwere appointed on the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nSpecial committees were appointed on the important subjects of\r\nBankruptcy and the Freedmen. Of the committee on the former, Thomas A.\r\nJenckes was appointed chairman. Thomas D. Eliot, of Massachusetts, was\r\nmade chairman of the Committee on the Freedmen.\r\n\r\nMany other committees were appointed whose labors were arduous and\r\nnecessary to our legislation, yet, as they had to do with subjects of\r\nno great general interest, they need not be named.\r\n\r\nThere was another committee, however, of great importance whose\r\nmembers were not yet designated. The resolution by which it should be\r\ncreated, was yet to pass through the ordeal of discussion. The process\r\nby which this committee was created will be described in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON RECONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n     Lack of Excitement -- Cause -- The Resolution -- Dilatory\r\n     Motions -- Yeas and Nays -- Proposed Amendments in the\r\n     Senate -- Debate in the Senate -- Mr. Howard -- Mr. Anthony\r\n     -- Mr. Doolittle -- Mr. Fessenden -- Mr. Saulsbury -- Mr.\r\n     Hendricks -- Mr. Trumbull -- Mr. Guthrie -- Passage of the\r\n     Resolution in the Senate -- Yeas and Nays -- Remarks of Mr.\r\n     Stevens on the Amendments of the Senate -- Concurrence of\r\n     the House -- The Committee appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it was known throughout the country that members-elect from\r\nTennessee and other States recently in rebellion would appear at\r\nWashington on the opening of the Thirty-ninth Congress, and demand\r\nrecognition of their right to represent their constituents, all eyes\r\nwere turned to observe the action which would be taken on the subject.\r\nIt was anticipated that the question would be sprung at once, and that\r\na season of storm and excitement would ensue, unparalleled in the\r\npolitical history of the nation. Since the American people are\r\nexceedingly fond of excitements and sensations, the expectation of\r\ntrouble in Congress drew immense numbers to its galleries on the first\r\nday of the session. Lovers of sensation were doomed to disappointment.\r\nCorrespondents and reporters for the press, who were prepared to\r\nfurnish for the newspapers descriptions of an opening of Congress\r\n\"dangerously boisterous,\" were compelled to describe it as\r\n\"exceptionally quiet.\"\r\n\r\nThe cause of this unexpected state of things was the fact that the\r\nmajority had previously come to the wise conclusion that it would not\r\nbe well to pass upon the admission of Southern members in open session\r\nand amid the confusion of organization. As there was so much\r\ndifference of opinion concerning the _status_ of the communities\r\nrecently in rebellion, and such a variety of considerations must be\r\nregarded in reaching wise conclusions, it was deemed advisable that\r\nthe whole subject should be calmly and deliberately investigated by a\r\nselect number of able and patriotic men from both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the first day of the session, soon after the House was\r\norganized, Mr. Thaddeus Stevens offered the following important\r\nRESOLUTION:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, by the Senate and House of Representatives in\r\n     Congress assembled, that a joint committee of fifteen\r\n     members shall be appointed, nine of whom shall be members of\r\n     the House, and six members of the Senate, who shall inquire\r\n     into the condition of the States which formed the so-called\r\n     Confederate States of America, and report whether they or\r\n     any of them are entitled to be represented in either House\r\n     of Congress, with leave to report at any time by bill or\r\n     otherwise; and until such report shall have been made, and\r\n     finally acted upon by Congress, no member shall be received\r\n     into either House from any of the said so-called Confederate\r\n     States; and all papers relating to the representation of the\r\n     said States shall be referred to the said committee without\r\n     debate.\"\r\n\r\nTo avoid the delay occasioned by a protracted debate, Mr. Stevens\r\ncalled the previous question. The minority perceived the impossibility\r\nof preventing the final passage of the resolution, yet deemed it their\r\nduty to put it off as far as possible by their only available\r\nmeans--\"dilatory motions.\" They first objected to the introduction of\r\nthe resolution, under the rule that unanimous consent must be given to\r\npermit a resolution to come before the House without notice given on a\r\nprevious day. To meet this difficulty, Mr. Stevens moved to suspend\r\nthe rules to enable him to introduce the resolution. On this motion\r\nthe yeas and nays were demanded. To suspend the rules under such\r\ncircumstances required a two-thirds' vote, which was given--one\r\nhundred and twenty-nine voting for, and thirty-five against the\r\nmotion. The rules having been suspended, the resolution was regularly\r\nbefore the House. A motion was then made to lay the resolution on the\r\ntable, and the yeas and nays demanded. Thirty-seven were in favor of\r\nthe motion, and one hundred and thirty-three against it. Before a call\r\nfor the previous question is available to cut off debate, it must, by\r\nthe rules of the House, be seconded by one-fifth of the members\r\npresent. This having been done, the vote was taken by yeas and nays on\r\nthe concurrent resolution submitted by Mr. Stevens. One hundred and\r\nthirty-three voted in favor of the resolution, and thirty-six against\r\nit, while thirteen were reported as \"not voting.\" As this vote was on\r\nan important measure, and is significant as marking with considerable\r\naccuracy the political complexion of the House of Representatives, it\r\nshould be given in detail.\r\n\r\nThe following are the names of those who voted \"Yea:\"\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Alley, Allison, Ames, Anderson, Baker, Baldwin,\r\n     Banks, Barker, Baxter, Beaman, Benjamin, Bidwell, Bingham,\r\n     Blow, Boutwell, Brandegee, Bromwell, Broomall, Buckland,\r\n     Bundy, Reader W. Clark, Sidney Clark, Cobb, Conkling, Cook,\r\n     Cullom, Culver, Darling, Davis, Dawes, Defrees, Delano,\r\n     Deming, Dixon, Donnelly, Driggs, Dumont, Eckley, Eggleston,\r\n     Eliot, Farnsworth, Ferry, Garfield, Grinnell, Griswold,\r\n     Hale, Abner C.

Randall, Raymond,\r\n     Alexander H. Rice, John H. Rice, Rollins, Sawyer, Schenck,\r\n     Scofield, Shellabarger, Smith, Spaulding, Starr, Stevens,\r\n     Stilwell, Thayer, John L. Thomas, Trowbridge, Upson, Van\r\n     Aernam, Burt Van Horn, Robert Van Horn, Ward, Warner, Elihu\r\n     B. Washburne, Welker, Wentworth, Whaley, Williams, James F.\r\n     Wilson, Windom, and Woodbridge.\r\n\r\nThe following members voted \"Nay:\"\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Ancona, Bergen, Boyer, Brooks, Chanler, Dawson,\r\n     Denison, Eldridge, Finck, Glossbrenner, Goodyear, Grider,\r\n     Aaron Harding, Hogan, James M. Humphrey, Johnson, Kerr, Le\r\n     Blond, McCullough, Niblack, Nicholson, Noell, Radford,\r\n     Samuel J. Randall, Ritter, Rogers, Ross, Shanklin,\r\n     Sitgreaves, Strouse, Tabor, Taylor, Thornton, Trimble,\r\n     Winfield, and Wright.\r\n\r\nThe following are reported as \"not voting:\"\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Delos R. Ashley, James M. Ashley, Blaine, Farquhar,\r\n     Harris, Edwin N. Hubbell, Jones, Marshall, Plants, Rousseau,\r\n     Sloan, Francis Thomas, Voorhees, and William B. Washburn.\r\n\r\nThus the resolution passed the House. The immense size of this body\r\nrequired that, by stringent rule, debate should have limitation, and\r\neven sometimes be cut off altogether by the operation of previous\r\nquestion. This arrangement enabled skillful and resolute leaders to\r\ncarry through this measure within an hour's time, whereas, in the\r\nSenate, a body of less than one-third the size, it passed after a\r\ndelay of several days, and at the end of a discussion of considerable\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the passage of the resolution in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, it was read in the Senate. Mr. Johnson, of Maryland,\r\nobjecting to its being considered on the day of its reception, under a\r\nregulation of the Senate it was postponed.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a week, on Tuesday, December 12, the resolution was\r\ntaken up for consideration in the Senate. Mr. Anthony moved to amend\r\nthe enacting clause so as to change it from a joint resolution to a\r\nconcurrent resolution, since, under its original shape, it would\r\nrequire the President's approval.\r\n\r\nThis amendment having been made, Mr. Anthony moved to further amend\r\nthe resolution by striking out all after the word \"otherwise.\" The\r\nfollowing are the words proposed to be stricken out:\r\n\r\n     \"And until such report shall have been made and finally\r\n     acted on by Congress, no member shall be received into\r\n     either house from any of the said so-called Confederate\r\n     States; and all papers relating to the representation of\r\n     said States shall be referred to the said committee without\r\n     debate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howard, of Michigan, preferred the resolution as it came from the\r\nHouse of Representatives. \"It contains within itself a pledge on the\r\npart of the two houses, that until the report of this important\r\ncommittee shall have been presented, we will not reädmit any of the\r\nrebel States, either by the recognition of their Senators or their\r\nRepresentatives. I think the country expects nothing less than this at\r\nour hands. I think that portion of the loyal people of the United\r\nStates who have sacrificed so much of blood and treasure in the\r\nprosecution of the war, and who secured to us the signal victory which\r\nwe have achieved over the rebellion, have a right to at least this\r\nassurance at our hands, that neither house of Congress will recognize\r\nas States any one of the rebel States until the event to which I have\r\nalluded.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, what is the present position and _status_ of the rebel States?\r\nIn my judgment they are simply conquered communities, subjugated by\r\nthe arms of the United States; communities in which the right of\r\nself-government does not now exist. Why? Because they have been for\r\nthe last four years hostile, to the most surprising unanimity hostile,\r\nto the authority of the United States, and have, during that period,\r\nbeen waging a bloody war against that authority. They are simply\r\nconquered communities, and we hold them, as we know well, as the world\r\nknows to-day, not by their own free will and consent as members of the\r\nUnion, but solely by virtue of our military power, which is executed\r\nto that effect throughout the length and breadth of the rebel States.\r\nThere is in those States no rightful authority, according to my view,\r\nat this time, but that of the United States; and every political act,\r\nevery governmental act exercised within their limits, must necessarily\r\nbe exercised and performed under the sanction and by the will of the\r\nconqueror.\r\n\r\n\"In short, sir, they are not to-day loyal States; their population are\r\nnot willing to-day, if we are rightly informed, to perform peaceably,\r\nquietly, and efficiently the duties which pertain to the population of\r\na State in the Union and of the Union; and for one I can not consent\r\nto recognize them, even indirectly, as entitled to be represented in\r\neither house of Congress at this time. The time has not yet come, in\r\nmy judgment, to do this. I think that, under present circumstances, it\r\nis due to the country that we should give them the assurance that we\r\nwill not thus hastily reädmit to seats in the legislative bodies here\r\nthe representatives of constituencies who are still hostile to the\r\nauthority of the United States. I think that such constituencies are\r\nnot entitled to be represented here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Anthony, of Rhode Island, said: \"The amendment was proposed from\r\nno opposition to what I understand to be the purpose of the words\r\nstricken out. That purpose I understand to be that both houses shall\r\nact in concert in any measures which they may take for the\r\nreconstruction of the States lately in rebellion. I think that that\r\nobject is eminently desirable, and not only that the two houses shall\r\nact in concert, but that Congress shall act in concert with the\r\nExecutive; that all branches of the Government shall approach this\r\ngreat question in a spirit of comprehensive patriotism, with\r\nconfidence in each other, with a conciliatory temper toward each\r\nother, and that each branch of the Government will be ready, if\r\nnecessary, to concede something of their own views in order to meet\r\nthe views of those who are equally charged with the responsibility of\r\npublic affairs.\r\n\r\n\"The words proposed to be stricken out refer to the joint committee of\r\nthe two houses of Congress matters which the Constitution confides to\r\neach house separately. Each house is made, by the Constitution, the\r\njudge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\"There is one other reason why I move this amendment, and that is,\r\nthat the resolution provides that papers shall be referred to this\r\ncommittee without debate. This is contrary to the practice of the\r\nSenate. The House of Representatives has found it necessary, for the\r\norderly transaction of its business, to put limitations upon debate,\r\nhence the previous question and the hour rule; but the Senate has\r\nalways resisted every proposition of this kind, and submitted to any\r\ninconvenience rather than check free discussion. Senators around me,\r\nwho were here in the minority, felt that the right of debate was a\r\nvery precious one to them at that time, and, as it was not taken from\r\nthem, they are not disposed to take it from the minority now.\r\n\r\n\"The purpose of all that is stricken out can be effected by the\r\nseparate action of the two houses, if they shall so elect. The House\r\nof Representatives, having passed this resolution by a great vote,\r\nwill undoubtedly adopt, in a separate resolution, what is here\r\nstricken out; and, except so far as relates to the restriction upon\r\ndebate, I shall, if this amendment be adopted and the resolution\r\npassed, offer a resolution substantially declaring it to be the\r\nopinion of the Senate that, until this committee reports--presuming\r\nthat it will report in a reasonable time--no action should be taken\r\nupon the representation of the States lately in rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle, of Wisconsin, said: \"All of these great questions,\r\nconcerning reconstruction, pacification, and restoration of civil\r\ngovernment in the Southern States, representation in this body, or any\r\nthing which concerns of Federal relations with the several States,\r\nought to be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. Such has been\r\nthe practice of this Government from the beginning. Great questions of\r\nconstitutional law, questions concerning the relations of the Union to\r\nthe States and the States to the Union, and above all, and without any\r\nexception, all questions relating to representation in this body, to\r\nits membership, have always been referred to the Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing in the history of the Senate, there is nothing in\r\nthe constitution of this committee, which would send these great\r\nconstitutional questions for advisement and consideration to any other\r\ncommittee than the Committee on the Judiciary. To place their\r\nconsideration in the hands of a committee which is beyond the control\r\nof the Senate, is to distrust ourselves; and to vote to send their\r\nconsideration to any other committee, is equivalent to a vote of want\r\nof confidence in the Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\n\"I object to this resolution, because, upon these great questions\r\nwhich are to go to the joint committee, the Senate does not stand upon\r\nan equality with the House. This resolution provides that, of the\r\njoint committee of fifteen, nine shall be appointed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, six only by the Senate, giving to the House portion\r\nof the committee a majority of three. We all know that in joint\r\ncommittees the members vote, not as the representatives of the two\r\nhouses, but _per capita_. The vote of a member of the committee from\r\nthe House weighs precisely the same as the vote of a member of the\r\ncommittee from the Senate; so that, to all intents and purposes, if we\r\npass this concurrent resolution, which we can not repeal but by the\r\nconcurrence of the other house, we place the consideration of these\r\ngrave questions in the hands of a committee which we can not control,\r\nand in which we have no equal voice.\r\n\r\n\"Under the Constitution, upon all subjects of legislation but one, the\r\ntwo houses are equal and coördinate branches of Congress. That one\r\nrelates to their representation in the bodies, to their membership,\r\nthat which constitutes their existence, which is essential to their\r\nlife and their independence. That is confided to each house, and to\r\neach house alone, to act for itself. It judges for itself upon the\r\nelections, returns, and qualifications of its members. It judges, it\r\nadmits, it punishes, it expels. It can not share that responsibility\r\nwith any other department of the Government. It can no more share it\r\nwith the other house than it can share it with the Supreme Court or\r\nwith the President. It is a matter over which its jurisdiction is\r\nexclusive of every other jurisdiction. It is a matter in which its\r\ndecisions, right or wrong, are absolute and without appeal. In my\r\nopinion the Senate of the United States can not give to a committee\r\nbeyond its control this question of the representation in this body,\r\nwithout a loss of its self-respect, its dignity, its independence;\r\nwithout an abandonment of its constitutional duty and a surrender of\r\nits constitutional powers.\r\n\r\n\"There is another provision in this resolution, as it stands, that we\r\nshall refer every paper to the committee without debate. Yes, sir, the\r\nSenate of the United States is to be led like a lamb to the slaughter,\r\nbound hand and foot, shorn of its constitutional power, and gagged,\r\ndumb; like the sheep brought to the block! Is this the condition to\r\nwhich the Senator from Michigan proposes to reduce the Senate of the\r\nUnited States by insisting upon such a provision as that contained in\r\nthe resolution as it comes from the House of Representatives?\r\n\r\n\"There is a still graver objection to this resolution as it stands.\r\nThe provision that 'until such report shall have been made and finally\r\nacted on by Congress, no member shall be received into either house\r\nfrom any of the so-called Confederate States,' is a provision which,\r\nby law, excludes those eleven States from their representation in the\r\nUnion. Sir, pass that resolution as it stands, and let it receive the\r\nsignature of the President, and you have accomplished what the\r\nrebellion could not accomplish, what the sacrifice of half a million\r\nmen could not accomplish in warring against this Government--you have\r\ndissolved the Union by act of Congress. Sir, are we prepared to\r\nsanction that? I trust never.\r\n\r\n\"The Senator from Michigan talks about the _status_ of these States.\r\nHe may very properly raise the question whether they have any\r\nLegislatures that are capable of electing Senators to this body. That\r\nis a question of fact to be considered; but as to whether they are\r\nStates, and States still within the Union, notwithstanding their civil\r\nform of government has been overturned by the rebellion, and their\r\nLegislatures have been disorganized, that they are still States in\r\nthis Union is the most sacred truth and the dearest truth to every\r\nAmerican heart, and it will be maintained by the American people\r\nagainst all opposition, come from what quarter it may. Sir, the flag\r\nthat now floats on the top of this Capitol bears thirty-six stars.\r\nEvery star represents a State in this Union. I ask the Senator from\r\nMichigan, does that flag, as it floats there, speak the nation's truth\r\nto our people and to the world, or is it a hypocritical, flaunting\r\nlie? That flag has been borne at the head of our conquering legions\r\nthrough the whole South, planted at Vicksburg, planted at Columbia,\r\nSavannah, Charleston, Sumter; the same old flag which came down before\r\nthe rebellion at Sumter was raised up again, and it still bore the\r\nsame glorious stars; 'not a star obscured,' not one.\r\n\r\n\"These people have been disorganized in their civil governments in\r\nconsequence of the war; the rebels overturned civil government in the\r\nfirst place, and we entered with our armies and captured the\r\nrebellion; but did that destroy the States? Not at all. We entered the\r\nStates to save them, not to destroy them. The guarantee of the\r\nConstitution is a guarantee to the States, and to every one of the\r\nStates, and the obligation that rests upon us is to guarantee to South\r\nCarolina a republican form of government as a State in this Union, and\r\nnot as a Territory. No State nor the people of any State had any power\r\nto withdraw from the Union. They could not do it peacefully; they\r\nundertook to do it by arms. We crushed the attempt; we trampled their\r\narmies under our feet; we captured the rebellion; the States are ours;\r\nand we entered them to save, and not to destroy.\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution of the United States requires the President, from\r\ntime to time, to give to Congress information of the state of the\r\nUnion. Who has any right to presume that the President will not\r\nfurnish the information which his constitutional duty requires? He has\r\nat his control all the agencies which are necessary. There is the able\r\nCabinet who surround him, with all the officers appointed under them:\r\nthe post-masters under the Post-office Department, the treasury agents\r\nunder the Treasury Department, and almost two hundred thousand men\r\nunder the control of the War Department, in every part of this\r\n'disaffected' region, who can bring to the President information from\r\nevery quarter of all the transactions that exist there. That the\r\nPresident of the United States will be sustained, in the views which\r\nhe takes in his message, by the people of this country, is as certain\r\nas the revolutions of the earth; and it is our duty to act\r\nharmoniously with him, to sustain him, to hold up his hands, to\r\nstrengthen his heart, to speak to him words of faith, friendship, and\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n\"I know that in all these Southern States there are a thousand things\r\nto give us pain, sometimes alarm, but notwithstanding the bad\r\nappearance which from time to time presents itself in the midst of\r\nthat boiling caldron of passion and excitement which the war has left\r\nstill raging there, the real progress which we have made has been most\r\nwonderful. I am one of those who look forward with hope, for I believe\r\nGod reigns and rules in the affairs of mankind. I look beyond the\r\nexcitement of the hour and all the outbreaking passion which sometimes\r\nshows itself in the South, which leads them to make enactments in\r\ntheir Legislatures which are disgraceful to themselves, and can never\r\nbe sanctioned by the people of this country, and also in spite of all\r\nthe excitement of the North, I behold the future full of confidence\r\nand hope. We have only to come up like men, and stand as the real\r\nfriends of the country and the Administration, and give to the policy\r\nof the President a fair and substantial trial, and all will be well.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden, of Maine, then remarked: \"When this resolution was\r\nfirst promulgated in the newspapers as having been agreed upon, I\r\napproved it because I sympathized with its object and purpose. I did\r\nnot examine it particularly; but, looking simply at what it was\r\ndesigned for, it met my approbation simply for this reason: that this\r\nquestion of the reädmission of these Confederate States, so called,\r\nand all the questions connected with that subject, I conceived to be\r\nof infinite importance, requiring calm and serious consideration, and\r\nI believe that the appointment of a committee, carefully selected by\r\nthe two houses, to take that subject into consideration, was not only\r\nwise in itself, but an imperative duty resting upon the\r\nrepresentatives of the people in the two branches of Congress. For\r\nmyself, I was not prepared to act upon that question at once. I am not\r\none of those who pin their faith upon any body, however eminent in\r\nposition, or conceive themselves obliged, on a question of great\r\nnational importance, to follow out any body's opinions simply because\r\nhe is in a position to make those opinions, perhaps, somewhat more\r\nimperative than any other citizen of the republic. Talk about the\r\nAdministration! Sir, we are a part of the Administration, and a very\r\nimportant part of it. I have no idea of abandoning the prerogatives,\r\nthe rights, and the duties of my position in favor of any body,\r\nhowever that person or any number of persons may desire it. In saying\r\nthis, I am not about to express an opinion upon the subject any\r\nfurther than I have expressed it, and that is, that in questions of\r\nsuch infinite importance as this, involving the integrity and welfare\r\nof the republic in all future time, we are solemnly bound, and our\r\nconstituents will demand of us that we examine them with care and\r\nfidelity, and act on our own convictions and not upon the convictions\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n\"I do not agree with the honorable Senator from Wisconsin, that by\r\npassing a simple resolution raising a committee of our own body, and\r\nreferring to it certain papers, if we conclude to do so, we are\r\ninfringing upon the rights of any body or making an intimation with\r\nregard to any policy that the President may have seen fit to adopt and\r\nrecommend to the country. Sir, I trust there are no such things as\r\nexclusive friends of the President among us, or gentlemen who desire\r\nto be so considered. I have as much respect for the President of the\r\nUnited States probably as any man. I acted with him long, and I might\r\nexpress the favorable opinions which I entertain of him here, if they\r\nwould not be out of place and in bad taste in this body. That I am\r\ndisposed and ready to support him to the best of my ability, as every\r\ngentleman around me is, in good faith and with kind feeling in all\r\nthat he may desire that is consistent with my views of duty to the\r\ncountry, giving him credit for intentions as good as mine, and with\r\nability far greater, I am ready to asseverate.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, I do not agree with the doctrine, and I desire to enter my\r\ndissent to it now and here, that, because a certain line of policy has\r\nbeen adopted by one branch of the Government, or certain views are\r\nentertained by one branch of the Government, therefore, for that\r\nreason alone and none other, that is to be tried, even if it is\r\nagainst my judgment; and I do not say that it is or is not. That is a\r\nquestion to be considered. I have a great respect, not for myself,\r\nperhaps, but for the position which I hold as a Senator of the United\r\nStates; and no measure of Government, no policy of the President, or\r\nof the head of a department, shall pass me while I am a Senator, if I\r\nknow it, until I have examined it and given my assent to it; not on\r\naccount of the source from which it emanates, but on account of its\r\nown intrinsic merits, and because I believe it will result in the good\r\nof my country. That is my duty as a Senator, and I fear no\r\nmisconstruction at home on this subject or any other.\r\n\r\n\"Now, therefore, sir, I hope that, laying aside all these matters,\r\nwhich are entirely foreign, we shall act upon this resolution simply\r\nas a matter of business. No one has a right to complain of it that we\r\nraise a committee for certain purposes of our own when we judge it to\r\nbe necessary. It is an imputation upon nobody; it is an insult to\r\nnobody; it is not any thing which any sensible man could ever find\r\nfault with, or be disposed to do so. It is our judgment, our\r\ndeliberate judgment, our friendly judgment--a course of action adopted\r\nfrom regard to the good of the community, and that good of the\r\ncommunity comprehends the good of every individual in it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, said: \"This resolution is very\r\nobjectionable to my mind. It is for the appointment of a committee of\r\nthe two houses to determine and to report upon what? The right of\r\nrepresentation of eleven States in this body. What determines the\r\nrights of those States to representation here? Is it the views of the\r\nmembers of the House of Representatives? Do we stand in need of any\r\nlight, however bright it may be, that may come from that distinguished\r\nquarter? Are we going to ask them to illuminate us by wisdom, and\r\nreport the fact to us whether those States are entitled to\r\nrepresentation on this floor?\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, on the first day of your assemblage after the battle\r\nof Manassas, you and they declared, by joint resolution, that the\r\nobject for which the war was waged was for no purpose of conquest or\r\nsubjugation, but it was to preserve the union of the States, and to\r\nmaintain the rights, dignity, and equality of the several States\r\nunimpaired. While that war was being waged there was no action, either\r\nof this house or of the House of Representatives, declaring that, when\r\nit was over, the existence of those States should be ignored, or their\r\nright to representation in Congress denied. Throughout the whole\r\ncontest the battle-cry was 'the preservation of the Union' and 'the\r\nUnion of the States.' If there was a voice then raised that those\r\nStates had ceased to have an existence in this body, it was so feeble\r\nas to be passed by and totally disregarded.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, suppose this committee should report that those States are not\r\nentitled to representation in this body, are you bound by their\r\naction? Is there not a higher law, the supreme law of the land, which\r\nsays if they be States that they shall each be entitled to two\r\nSenators on this floor? And shall a report of a joint committee of the\r\ntwo houses override and overrule the fundamental law of the land? Sir,\r\nit is dangerous as a precedent, and I protest against it as an humble\r\nmember of this body. If they be not States, then the object avowed for\r\nwhich the war was waged was false.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hendricks, of Indiana, said: \"I shall vote against this resolution\r\nbecause it refers to a joint committee a subject which, according to\r\nmy judgment, belongs exclusively to the Senate. I know that the\r\nresolution no longer provides in express terms that the Senate,\r\npending the continuance of the investigation of this committee, will\r\nnot consider the question of credentials from these States, but in\r\neffect it amounts to that. The question is to be referred to the\r\ncommittee, and according to usage, and it would seem to be the very\r\npurpose of reference that the body shall not consider the subject\r\nwhile the question is before them. I could not vote for a resolution\r\nthat refers to a joint committee a subject that this body alone can\r\ndecide. If there are credentials presented here, this body must decide\r\nthe question whether the person presenting the credentials is entitled\r\nto a seat; and how can this body be influenced by any committee other\r\nthan a committee that it shall raise itself?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull, of Illinois, then followed: \"If I understood the\r\nresolution as the Senator from Indiana does, I should certainly vote\r\nwith him; but I do not so understand it. It is simply a resolution\r\nthat a joint committee be raised to inquire into the condition of the\r\nStates which formed the so-called Confederate States of America, and\r\nto report whether they or any of them are entitled to be represented\r\nin either House of Congress, with leave to report at any time by bill\r\nor otherwise. It is true, as the Senator says, that after having\r\nraised this committee, the Senate will not be likely to take action in\r\nregard to the admission of the Senators from any of these States until\r\nthe committee shall have had a reasonable time at least to act and\r\nreport; but it is very desirable that we should have joint action upon\r\nthis subject. It would produce a very awkward and undesirable state of\r\nthings if the House of Representatives were to admit members from one\r\nof the lately rebellious States, and the Senate were to refuse to\r\nreceive Senators from the same State.\r\n\r\n\"We all know that the State organizations in certain States of the\r\nUnion have been usurped and overthrown. This is a fact of which we\r\nmust officially take notice. There was a time when the Senator from\r\nIndiana, as well as myself, would not have thought of receiving a\r\nSenator from the Legislature, or what purported to be the Legislature,\r\nof South Carolina. When the people of that State, by their\r\nRepresentatives, undertook to withdraw from the Union and set up an\r\nindependent government in that State, in hostility to the Union, when\r\nthe body acting as a Legislature there was avowedly acting against\r\nthis Government, neither he nor I would have received Representatives\r\nfrom it. That was a usurpation which, by force of arms, we have put\r\ndown. Now the question arises, Has a State government since been\r\ninaugurated there entitled to representation? Is not that a fair\r\nsubject of inquiry? Ought we not to be satisfied upon that point? We\r\ndo not make such an inquiry in reference to members that come from\r\nStates which have never undertaken to deny their allegiance to the\r\nGovernment of the United States. Having once been admitted as States,\r\nthey continue so until by some positive act they throw off their\r\nallegiance, and assume an attitude of hostility to the Government, and\r\nmake war upon it; and while in that condition, I know we should all\r\nobject that they, of course, could not be represented in the Congress\r\nof the United States. Now, is it not a proper subject for inquiry to\r\nascertain whether they have assumed a position in harmony with the\r\nGovernment? and is it not proper that that inquiry should be made the\r\nsubject of joint action?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Guthrie, of Kentucky, wished to ask the friends of this resolution\r\nif it was contemplated that this committee should take evidence, and\r\nreport that evidence to the two houses. \"If,\" said he, \"they are only\r\nto take what is open to every member of the Senate, the fact that the\r\nrebellion has been suppressed; the fact that the President of the\r\nUnited States has appointed officers to collect the taxes, and, in\r\nsome instances, judges and other officers; that he has sent the\r\npost-office into all the States; that there have been found enough\r\nindividuals loyal to the country to accept the offices; the fact that\r\nthe President has issued his proclamation to all these States,\r\nappointing Provisional Governors; that they have all elected\r\nconventions; that the conventions have rescinded the ordinances of\r\nsecession; that most of them have amended their constitutions and\r\nabolished slavery, and the Legislatures of some of them have passed\r\nthe amendment to the Constitution on the subject of slavery--if they\r\nare only to take these facts, which are open and clear to us all, I\r\ncan see no necessity for such a committee. My principal objection to\r\nthe resolution is, that this committee can give us no information\r\nwhich we do not now possess, coupled with the fact that the loyal\r\nconservative men of the United States, North, South, East, and West,\r\ndo most earnestly desire that we shall so act that there shall be no\r\nlonger a doubt that we are the United States of America, in full\r\naccord and harmony with each other.\r\n\r\n\"I know it has been said that the President had no authority to do\r\nthese things. I read the Constitution and the laws of this country\r\ndifferently. He is to 'take care that the laws be faithfully\r\nexecuted;' he is to suppress insurrection and rebellion. The power is\r\nput in his hands, and I do not see why, when he marches into a rebel\r\nState, he has not authority to put down a rebel government and put up\r\na government that is friendly to the United States, and in accordance\r\nwith it. I do not see why he can not do that while the war goes on,\r\nand I do not see why he may not do it after the war is over. The\r\npeople in those States lie at the mercy of the nation. I see no\r\nusurpation in what he has done, and if the work is well done, I, for\r\none, am ready to accept it. Are we to send out a commission to see\r\nwhat the men whom he has appointed have done? It is said that they are\r\nnot to be relied on; that they have been guilty of treason, and we\r\nwill not trust them. I hope that no such ideas will prevail here. I\r\nthink this will be a cold shock to the warm feelings of the nation for\r\nrestoration, for equal privileges and equal rights. They were in\r\ninsurrection. We have suppressed that insurrection. They are now\r\nStates of the Union; and if they come here according to the laws of\r\nthe States, they are entitled, in my judgment, to representation, and\r\nwe have no right to refuse it. They are in a minority, and they would\r\nbe in a minority even if they meant now what they felt when they\r\nraised their arms against the Government; but they do not, and of\r\nthose whom they will send here to represent them, nineteen out of\r\ntwenty will be just as loyal as any of us--even some of those who took\r\nup arms against us.\r\n\r\n\"I really hope to see some one move a modification of the test oath,\r\nso that those who have repented of their disloyalty may not be\r\nexcluded, for I really believe that a great many of those who took up\r\narms honestly and wished to carry out the doctrines of secession, and\r\nwho have succumbed under the force of our arms and the great force of\r\npublic opinion, can be trusted a great deal more than those who did\r\nnot fight at all.\r\n\r\n\"To conclude, gentlemen, I see no great harm in this resolution except\r\nthe procrastination that will result from it, and that will give us\r\nnothing but what we have before us.\"\r\n\r\nThe question being taken, the resolution, as amended, passed the\r\nSenate, thirty-three voting in the affirmative and eleven in the\r\nnegative. The following are the names of those who voted for the\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Anthony, Brown, Chandler, Clark, Conness, Creswell,\r\n     Fessenden, Foot, Foster, Grimes, Harris, Howard, Howe, Lane\r\n     of Indiana, Lane of Kansas, Morgan, Morrill, Norton, Nye,\r\n     Poland, Pomeroy, Ramsey, Sherman, Sprague, Stewart, Sumner,\r\n     Trumbull, Van Winkle, Wade, Willey, Williams, Wilson, and\r\n     Yates.\r\n\r\nThe following Senators voted against the resolution:\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Buckalew, Cowan, Dixon, Doolittle, Guthrie,\r\n     Hendricks, Johnson, Riddle, Saulsbury, Stockton, and Wright.\r\n\r\nFive Senators were absent: Messrs. Cragin, Davis, Henderson,\r\nMcDougall, and Nesmith.\r\n\r\nOn the day succeeding the adoption of the concurrent resolution by the\r\nSenate, the amendments of that body came before the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Mr. Thaddeus Stevens moved that the House concur in\r\nthe amendments of the Senate. He said: \"The Senate took what to them\r\nappeared to be the proper view of their prerogatives, and, though they\r\ndid not seem to differ with us as to the main object, the mode of\r\ngetting at it with them was essential, and they very properly put the\r\nresolution in the shape they considered right. They have changed the\r\nform of the resolution so as not to require the assent of the\r\nPresident; and they have also considered that each house should\r\ndetermine for itself as to the reference of papers, by its own action\r\nat the time. To this I see no objection, and, while moving to concur,\r\nI will say now, that when it is in order I shall move, or some other\r\ngentleman will move when his State is called, a resolution precisely\r\nsimilar, or very nearly similar, to the provision which the Senate has\r\nstricken out, only applicable to the House alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe House then concurred in the amendments of the Senate, so the\r\nresolution passed in the following form:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, by the House of Representatives (the Senate\r\n     concurring), That a joint committee of fifteen members shall\r\n     be appointed, nine of whom shall be members of the House,\r\n     and six members of the Senate, who shall inquire into the\r\n     condition of the States which formed the so-called\r\n     Confederate States of America, and report whether they, or\r\n     any of them, are entitled to be represented in either house\r\n     of Congress, with leave to report at any time, by bill or\r\n     otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nA resolution subsequently passed the House, \"That all papers offered\r\nrelative to the representation of the late so-called Confederate\r\nStates of America, shall be referred to the joint committee of fifteen\r\nwithout debate, and no members shall be admitted from either of said\r\nso-called States until Congress shall declare such States entitled to\r\nrepresentation.\"\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of December the Speaker announced the names of the\r\ncommittee on the part of the House. They were: Thaddeus Stevens, Elihu\r\nB. Washburn, Justin S. Morrill, Henry Grider, John A. Bingham, Roscoe\r\nConkling, George S. Boutwell, Henry T. Blow, and Andrew J. Rogers.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first of December the following gentlemen were announced\r\nas members of the committee on the part of the Senate: William Pitt\r\nFessenden, James W. Grimes, Ira Harris, Jacob M. Howard, Reverdy\r\nJohnson, and George H. Williams.\r\n\r\nThus, before the adjournment of Congress for the holidays, the Joint\r\nCommittee of Fifteen on Reconstruction had been appointed and\r\nempowered to proceed with investigations of the utmost importance to\r\nthe country. Hated by the late insurgents of the South, who expected\r\nlittle leniency at its hands; opposed by politicians at the North, who\r\nviewed it as an obstacle in the way of their designs, and even\r\nmisrepresented by the President himself, who stigmatized it as a\r\n\"Central Directory,\" this committee went forward in the discharge of\r\nits important duties, without fear or favor, having a marked influence\r\nupon the doings of Congress and the destinies of the country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other important measures were enlisting the attention of\r\nCongress, and were proceeding, by the slow but steady steps of\r\nparliamentary progress, to their final consummation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\n     Duty of Congress to legislate for the District of Columbia\r\n     -- Suffrage Bill introduced into the House -- Speech by Mr.\r\n     Wilson -- Mr. Boyer -- Mr. Schofield -- Mr. Kelley -- Mr.\r\n     Rogers -- Mr. Farnsworth -- Mr. Davis -- Mr. Chanler -- Mr.\r\n     Bingham -- Mr. Grinnell -- Mr. Kasson -- Mr. Julian -- Mr.\r\n     Thomas -- Mr. Darling -- Mr. Hale's amendment -- Mr. Thayer\r\n     -- Mr. Van Horn -- Mr. Clarke -- Mr. Johnson -- Mr.\r\n     Boutwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever differences of opinion may exist as to the authority of\r\nCongress to legislate for States loyal or disloyal, or for\r\nTerritories, there is entire unanimity as to the power and duty of\r\nCongress to enact laws for the District of Columbia. Here there is no\r\ncountercurrent of \"reserved rights\" or \"State sovereignty\" opposed to\r\nthe authority of Congress.\r\n\r\nCongress being responsible for the legislation of the District of\r\nColumbia, we naturally look in that direction for an exhibition in\r\nminiature of the policy of the national legislature on questions\r\nrelating to the interests of the nation at large. If slavery\r\nflourished and the slave-market existed in the capital, it was because\r\na majority of the people of the United States were willing. So soon as\r\nthe nation became anti-slavery, the \"peculiar institution\" could no\r\nlonger exist in the District of Columbia, although it might still\r\nsurvive in other localities.\r\n\r\nThe General Government having become completely disenthralled from the\r\ndominion of slavery, and a wide-spread opinion prevailing at the North\r\nthat all loyal men should enjoy the right of suffrage, the members of\r\nthe Thirty-ninth Congress convened with a sense of duty impelling them\r\nto begin the great work of political reform at the capital itself.\r\nHence Mr. Wade, as we have seen, on the first day of the session,\r\nintroduced \"Senate bill Number One,\" designed, as its title declared,\r\n\"to regulate the elective franchise in the District of Columbia.\" In\r\nthe House of Representatives, on the second day of the session, Mr.\r\nKelley introduced \"a bill extending the right of suffrage in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\" This bill was referred to the Judiciary\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, on the 18th of December, Mr. Wilson,\r\nchairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, reported a bill extending\r\nthe right of suffrage in the District of Columbia. The bill provided\r\nthat from all laws and parts of laws prescribing the qualification of\r\nelectors for any office in the District of Columbia, the word \"white\"\r\nshould be stricken out; also, that from and after the passage of the\r\nbill, no person should be disqualified from voting at any election\r\nheld in the District of Columbia on account of color; also, that all\r\nacts of Congress, and all laws of the State of Maryland in force in\r\nthe District of Columbia, and all ordinances of the cities of\r\nWashington and Georgetown inconsistent with the provisions of the\r\nbill, should be repealed and annulled.\r\n\r\nThis bill was made the special order for Wednesday the 10th of\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson, of Iowa, whose duty it was, as chairman of the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, to report the bill, opened the discussion by speaking as\r\nfollows in favor of the measure:\r\n\r\n\"Can we excuse ourselves in continuing a limitation on the right of\r\nsuffrage in the capital of the republic that has no justification in\r\nreason, justice, or in the principles on which we profess to have\r\nbased our entire political system? Upon this question there seems to\r\nhave been but little difference of opinion among the men who laid the\r\nfoundation and built the superstructure of this Government. In those\r\ndays no limitation was placed upon the enjoyment of the defensive\r\nrights of the citizen, including the right of suffrage, on account of\r\nthe color of the skin, except in the State of South Carolina. All of\r\nthe other States participating in the formation of the Government of\r\nthe United States had some limitation, based on sex, or age, or\r\nproperty placed upon the right of suffrage; but none of them so far\r\nforgot the spirit of our Constitution, the great words of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, or the genius of our institutions, as to\r\ninquire into the color of a citizen before allowing him the great\r\ndefensive right of the ballot. It is true, that as the republic moved\r\noff in its grand course among the nations a change occurred in the\r\nminds and practices of the people of a majority of the States. The\r\nlove of liberty, because of its own great self, and not because of its\r\napplication to men of a particular color, lost its sensitive character\r\nand active vitality. The moral sense of the people became dormant\r\nthrough the malign influence of that tolerated enemy to all social and\r\ngovernmental virtue, human slavery. The public conscience slumbered,\r\nits eyes closed with dollars and its ears stuffed with cotton. When\r\nthese things succeeded the active justice, abounding mercy, and love\r\nof human rights of the earlier days, State after State fell into the\r\ndark line of South Carolinian oppression, and adopted her\r\nanti-republican limitation of the right of suffrage. A few States\r\nstood firm and kept their faith, and to-day, when compared with the\r\nbruised and peeled and oppression-cursed State of South Carolina,\r\nstand forth as shining examples of the great rewards that are poured\r\nupon the heads of the just. Massachusetts and South Carolina, the one\r\ntrue, the other false to the faith and ideas of the early life of the\r\nnation, should teach us how safe it is to do right, and how dangerous\r\nit is to do wrong; how much safer it is to do justice than it is to\r\npractice oppression.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, not the States alone fell into this grievous error. The\r\nGeneral Government took its stand upon the side of injustice, and\r\napostatized from the true faith of the nation, by depriving a portion\r\nof its citizens of the political right of self-defense, the use of the\r\nballot. What good has come to us from this apostasy? Take the history\r\nof the municipal government of this city, and what is there in its\r\npages to make an American feel proud of the results of this departure\r\nfrom the principles of true democracy? Is there a worse governed city\r\nin all the republic? Where in all the country was there to be found\r\nsuch evidences of thriftless dependence as in this city before the\r\ncold breath of the North swept down here during the rebellion and\r\nimparted a little of 'Yankee' vigor to its business and population?\r\nWhere within the bounds of professed fidelity to the Government was\r\ntrue loyalty at a lower ebb, and sympathy with the rebellion at higher\r\nflood; freedom more hated, and emancipation more roundly denounced;\r\nwhite troops harder to raise, and black ones more heartily despised;\r\nUnion victories more coldly received, and reverses productive of less\r\ndespondency, than right among that portion of the voting population\r\nand its adjuncts which control the local elections in this District?\r\nWith what complaisance the social elements of this capital fostered\r\nthe brood of traitors who rushed hence to the service of the rebellion\r\nin 1861! Are these fruits of our errors pleasing?\r\n\r\n\"I would not be vindictive, I would be just. I do not want to\r\nlegislate against the white citizen for the purpose of advancing the\r\ninterests of the colored citizen. It is best to guard against all such\r\nlegislation. Let the laws which we pass here be of such pure\r\nrepublican character, that no person can tell from the reading of them\r\nwhat color is stamped upon the faces of the citizens of the United\r\nStates. Let us have no class legislation, no class privileges. Let our\r\nlaws be just and uniform in their operation. This is the smooth sea\r\nupon which our ship of state may sail; all others are tempestuous and\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Mr. Speaker, who are the persons upon whom this bill will\r\noperate, if we shall place it upon the statute-book of the nation?\r\nThey are citizens of the United States and residents of the District\r\nof Columbia. It is true that many of them have black faces, but that\r\nis God's work, and he is wiser than we. Some of them have faces marked\r\nby colors uncertain; that is not God's fault. Those who hate black men\r\nmost intensely can tell more than all others about this mixture of\r\ncolors. But, mixed or black, they are citizens of this republic, and\r\nthey have been, and are to-day, true and loyal to their Government;\r\nand this is vastly more than many of their contemners can claim for\r\nthemselves. In this District a white skin was not the badge of loyalty\r\nwhile a black skin was. No traitor breathed the air of this capital\r\nwearing a black skin. Through all the gradations of traitors, from\r\nWirz to Jeff. Davis, criminal eyes beamed from white faces. Through\r\nall phases of treason, from the bold stroke of Lee upon the\r\nbattle-field to the unnatural sympathy of those who lived within this\r\nDistrict, but hated the sight of their country's flag, runs the blood\r\nwhich courses only under a white surface. While white men were fleeing\r\nfrom this city to join their fortunes with the rebel cause, the\r\nreturning wave brought black faces in their stead. White enemies went\r\nout, black friends came in. As true as truth itself were these poor\r\nmen to the cause of this imperiled nation. Wherever we have trusted\r\nthem, they have been true. Why will we not deal justly by them? Why\r\nshall we not, in this District, where the first effective legislative\r\nblow fell upon slavery, declare that these suffering, patient, devoted\r\nfriends of the republic shall have the power to protect their own\r\nrights by their own ballots? Is it because they are ignorant? Sir, we\r\nare estopped from that plea. It comes too late. We did not make this\r\ninquiry in regard to the white voter. It is only when we see a man\r\nwith a dark skin that we think of ignorance. Let us not stand on this\r\nnow in relation to this District. The fact itself is rapidly passing\r\naway, for there is no other part of the population of the District so\r\ndiligent in the acquisition of knowledge as the colored portion. In\r\nspite of the difficulties placed in their pathway to knowledge by the\r\nwhite residents, the colored people, adults and children, are pressing\r\nsteadily on.\r\n\r\n\"Taken as a class, they surely show themselves possessed of enough of\r\nthe leaven of thrift, education, morality, and religion to render it\r\nsafe for us to make the experiment of impartial suffrage here. Let us\r\nmake the trial. A failure can work no great harm, for to us belongs\r\nthe power to make any change which the future may show to be\r\nnecessary. How can we tell whether success or failure shall be the\r\nfruit of a practical application of the principles upon which our\r\ninstitutions rest, unless we put them to a fair test? Give every man a\r\nfair chance to show how well he can discharge the duties of fully\r\nrecognized citizenship. This is the way to solve the problem, and in\r\nno other way can it be determined. That success will attend the\r\nexperiment I do not doubt. Others believe the result will prove quite\r\nthe reverse. Who is right and who wrong can be ascertained only by\r\nputting the two opinions to a practical test. The passage of this bill\r\nwill furnish this test, and to that end I ask for it the favorable\r\nconsideration of this house.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, said: \"The design of this bill is to\r\ninaugurate here, upon this most conspicuous stage, the first act of\r\nthe new political drama which is intended to culminate in the complete\r\npolitical equality of the races and the establishment of negro\r\nsuffrage throughout the States. Constitutional amendments with this\r\nview have been already introduced at both ends of the Capitol. The\r\nobject of the leaders of this movement is no longer concealed; and if\r\nthere is any thing in their action to admire, it is the candor,\r\ncourage, and ability with which they press their cause. The agitation\r\nis to go on until the question has been settled by the country, and it\r\nmay as well be met here upon the threshold. The monstrous proposition\r\nis nothing less than the absorption into the body politic of the\r\nnation of a colored population equal to one-sixth of all the\r\ninhabitants of the country, as the census reports will show. Four\r\nmillions of the population so to be amalgamated have been just set\r\nfree from a servitude, the debasing influences of which have many a\r\ntime been vividly depicted in the anti-slavery speeches of the very\r\nmen who are the most prominent champions of this new political\r\ngospel.\r\n\r\n\"The argument in favor of the American negro's right to vote must be\r\nmeasured by his capacity to understand and his ability to use such\r\nright for the promotion of the public good. And that is the very\r\nmatter in dispute. But the point does not turn simply upon the\r\ninferiority of the negro race; for differences without inferiority may\r\nunfit one race for political or social assimilation with another, and\r\nrender their fusion in the same government incompatible with the\r\ngeneral welfare. It is, as I conceive, upon these principles that we\r\nmust settle the question whether this is a white man's government.\r\n\r\n\"The negro has no history of civilization. From the earliest ages of\r\nrecorded time he has ever been a savage or a slave. He has populated\r\nwith teeming millions the vast extent of a continent, but in no\r\nportion of it has he ever emerged from barbarism, and in no age or\r\ncountry has he ever established any other stable government than a\r\ndespotism. But he is the most obedient and happy of slaves.\r\n\r\n\"Of all men, the negroes themselves are best contented with their\r\nsituation. They are not the prime movers in the agitations which\r\nconcern them. An examination of the tables of the last census will\r\ndemonstrate that they do not attach much importance to political\r\nrights. It will be found that the free people of color are most\r\nnumerous in some of those States which accord them the fewest\r\npolitical privileges; and in those States which have granted them the\r\nright of suffrage they seem to see but few attractions. In Maryland\r\nthere were, in 1860, 83,942 free people of color; in Pennsylvania,\r\n56,949; in Ohio, 36,673. In neither of those States were they voters.\r\nIn the State of New York, where they could not vote except under a\r\nproperty qualification, which excluded the most of them, they numbered\r\n49,005. But in Massachusetts, where they did then and do now vote,\r\nthere were but 9,602. And in all New England, (except Connecticut,\r\nwhere they are not allowed to vote,) there were at the last census but\r\n16,084. If the American negro, in his desire and capacity for\r\nself-government, bore any resemblance to the Caucasian, he would\r\ndistinguish himself by emigration; and, spurning the soil which had\r\nenslaved his race, he would seek equality and independence in a more\r\ncongenial clime. But the spirit of independence and hardy manhood\r\nwhich brought the Puritans to the shores of a New England wilderness\r\nhe lacks. He will not even go to Massachusetts now, although, instead\r\nof a stormy ocean, his barrier is only an imaginary State line, and\r\ninstead of a howling wilderness, he is invited to a land resounding\r\nwith the myriad voices of the industrial arts, and instead of painted\r\nsavages with uplifted tomahawks, he has reason to expect a crowd of\r\nmale and female philanthropists, with beaming faces and outstretched\r\nhands, to welcome him and call him brother. There will he find\r\nlecturers to prove his equality, and statesmen to claim him as an\r\nassociate ruler in the land. If he cares for these things, or is fit\r\nfor them, why does he linger outside upon the very borders of his\r\npolitical Eden? Why does he not enter into it--avoiding Connecticut in\r\nhis route--and take possession? The fact is, that the fine political\r\ntheories set up in his behalf are not in accordance with the natural\r\ninstinct of the negro, which, in this particular, is truer than the\r\nphilosophy of his white advisers.\r\n\r\n\"They are but superficial thinkers who imagine that the organic\r\ndifferences of races can be obliterated by the education of the\r\nschools. The qualities of races are perpetuated by descent, and are\r\nthe result of historical influences reaching far back into the\r\ngenerations of the past. An educated negro is a negro still. The\r\ncunning of the chisel of a Canova could not make an enduring\r\nCorinthian column out of a block of anthracite; not because of its\r\ncolor, but on account of the structure of its substance. He might\r\nindeed, with infinite pains, give it the form, but he could not impart\r\nto it the strength and adhesion of particles required to enable it to\r\nbrave the elements, and the temple it was made to support would soon\r\ncrumble into ruin.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Schofield, of Pennsylvania, said: \"The cheapest elevator and best\r\nmoralizer for an oppressed and degraded class is to inspire them with\r\nself-respect, with the belief in the possibility of their elevation.\r\nBestow the elective franchise upon the colored population of this\r\nDistrict, and you awaken the hope and ambition of the whole race\r\nthroughout the country. Hitherto punishment has been the only\r\nincentive to sobriety and industry furnished these people by American\r\nlaw. They were kept too low to feel disgrace, and reward was\r\ninconsistent with the theory of 'service owed.' Let us try now the\r\npersuasive power of wages and protection. If colored suffrage is still\r\nconsidered an experiment, this District is a good place in which to\r\ntry it. The same objections do not exist here that are urged on behalf\r\nof some of the States. No constitutional question intervenes. Here, at\r\nleast, Congress is supreme. The law can be passed, and if it is found\r\nto be bad, a majority can repeal it. The colored race is too small in\r\nnumbers here to endanger the supremacy of the white people, but large\r\nand loyal enough to counteract to some extent disloyal proclivities.\r\n\r\n\"Both the precept and practice of our fathers refute the allegation\r\nthat this is exclusively a white man's government. If we can not now\r\nconsent to so slight a recognition, as proposed by this bill, of the\r\ngreat underlying theory of our Government, as declared and practiced\r\nby our fathers, we are thrown back upon that new and monstrous\r\ndoctrine, that the five millions of our colored population, and their\r\nposterity forever, have no rights that a white man is bound to\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\"Who pronounces this crushing sentence? The political South. And what\r\nis this South? The Southern master and his Northern minion. Have these\r\npeople wronged the South? Have they filled it with violence, outrage,\r\nand murder? No, sir; they are remarkably gentle, patient, and\r\nrespectful. Have they despoiled its wealth or diminished its grandeur?\r\nNo, sir; their unpaid toil has made the material South. They removed\r\nthe forests, cleared the fields, built the dwellings, churches,\r\ncolleges, cities, highways, railroads, and canals. Why, then, does the\r\nSouth hate and persecute these people? Because it has wronged them.\r\nInjustice always hates its victim. They are forced to look to the\r\nNorth for justice. And what is the North? Not the latitude of frosts;\r\nnot New England and the States that border on the lakes, the\r\nMississippi, and the Pacific. The geographical is lost in the\r\npolitical meaning of the word. The North, in a political sense, means\r\njustice, liberty, and union, and in the order in which I have named\r\nthem. Jefferson defined this 'North' when he wrote 'all men are\r\ncreated equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable\r\nrights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'\r\nThis North has no geographical boundaries. It embraces the friends of\r\nfreedom in every quarter of this great republic. Many of its bravest\r\nchampions hail from the geographical South. The North, that did not\r\nfear the slave power in its prime, in the day of its political\r\nstrength and patronage, when it commanded alike the nation and the\r\nmob, and for the same cruel purpose, will not be intimidated by its\r\nexpiring maledictions around this capital. The North must pass this\r\nbill to vindicate its sincerity and its courage. The slave power has\r\nalready learned that the North is terrible in war, and forgiving and\r\ngentle in peace; let its crushed and mangled victims learn from the\r\npassage of this bill, that the justice of the North, unlimited by\r\nlines of latitude, unlimited by color or race, slumbereth not.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, followed: \"In preparing to begin the work\r\nof reconstructing the grandest of human governments, shattered for a\r\ntime by treason, and in endeavoring to ascertain what we should do,\r\nand how and when it should be done, I have consulted no popular\r\nimpulse. Groping my way through the murky political atmosphere that\r\nhas prevailed for more than thirty years, I have seated myself at the\r\nfeet of the fathers of our country, that I might, as far as my\r\nsuggestions would go, make them in accordance with the principles of\r\nthose who constructed our Government. I can make no suggestion for the\r\nimprovement of the primary principles or general structure of our\r\nGovernment, and I would heal its wounds so carefully that it should\r\ndescend to posterity unstained and unmarred as it came, under the\r\nguidance of Providence, from the hands of those who fashioned it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon. William D. Kelley, representative from\r\nPennsylvania.]\r\n\r\n\"For whom do we ask this legislation? In 1860, according to the\r\ncensus, there were fourteen thousand three hundred and sixteen colored\r\npeople in this District, and we ask this legislation for the male\r\nadults of that number. Are they in rags and filth and degradation? The\r\ntax-books of the District will tell you that they pay taxes on\r\n$1,250,000 worth of real estate, held within the limits of this\r\nDistrict. On one block, on which they pay taxes on fifty odd thousand\r\ndollars, there are but two colored freeholders who have not bought\r\nthemselves out of slavery. One of them has bought as many as eight\r\npersons beside himself--a wife and seven children. Coming to freedom\r\nin manhood, mortgaged for a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars as his\r\nown price, he has earned and carried to the Southern robber thousands\r\nof dollars, the price extorted for his wife and children, and is now a\r\nfreeholder in this District. They have twenty-one churches, which they\r\nown, and which they maintain at an annual cost of over twenty thousand\r\ndollars. Their communing members number over forty-three hundred. In\r\ntheir twenty-two Sunday-schools they gather on each Sabbath over three\r\nthousand American children of African descent. They maintain, sir, to\r\nthe infamous disgrace of the American Congress and people,\r\nthirty-three day schools, eight of which are maintained exclusively by\r\ncontributions from colored citizens of the District; the remainder by\r\ntheir contributions, eked out by contributions from the generous\r\npeople of the North; and every dollar of their million and a quarter\r\ndollars of real estate and personal property is taxed for schools to\r\neducate the children of the white people of the District, the fathers\r\nof many of those children having been absent during the war fighting\r\nfor the Confederacy and against our constitutional flag. Who shall\r\nreproach them with being poor and ignorant while Congress, which has\r\nexclusive jurisdiction over the District, has, till last year, robbed\r\nthem day by day, and barred the door of the public school against\r\nthem? Such reproach does not lie in the white man's mouth; at any\r\nrate, no member of the Democratic party ought to utter it.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate was continued on the day following. Mr. Rogers, of New\r\nJersey, having obtained the floor, addressed the House for two hours.\r\nHe said: \"I hold that there never has been, in the legislation of the\r\nUnited States, a bill which involved so momentous consequences as that\r\nnow under consideration, because nowhere in the history of this\r\ncountry, from the time that the first reins of party strife were drawn\r\nover the land, was any political party ever known to advocate the\r\ndoctrine now advocated by a portion of the party on the other side of\r\nthis House, except within the last year, and during the heat and\r\nstrife of battle in the land. The wisdom of ages for more than five\r\nthousand years, and the most enlightened governments that ever existed\r\nupon the face of the earth, have handed down to us that grand\r\nprinciple that all governments of a civilized character have been and\r\nwere intended especially for the benefit of white men and white women,\r\nand not for those who belong to the negro, Indian, or mulatto race.\r\n\r\n\"It is the high prerogative which the political system of this country\r\nhas given to the masses, rich and poor, to exercise the right of\r\nsuffrage and declare, according to the honest convictions of their\r\nhearts, who shall be the officers to rule over them. There is no\r\nprivilege so high, there is no right so grand. It lies at the very\r\nfoundation of this Government; and when you introduce into the social\r\nsystem of this country the right of the African race to compete at the\r\nballot-box with the intelligent white citizens of this country, you\r\nare disturbing and embittering the whole social system; you rend the\r\nbonds of a common political faith; you break up commercial intercourse\r\nand the free interchanges of trade, and you degrade the people of this\r\ncountry before the eyes of the envious monarchs of Europe, and fill\r\nour history with a record of degradation and shame.\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, should we attempt at this time to inflict the system of\r\nnegro suffrage upon those who happen to be so unfortunate as to reside\r\nin the District of Columbia? This city bears the name of George\r\nWashington, the father of our country; and as it was founded by him,\r\nso I wish to hand it down to those who shall come after us, preserving\r\nthat principle which declares that the sovereignty is in the white\r\npeople of the country, for whose benefit this Government was\r\nestablished. I am not ready to believe that those men who have laid\r\ndown their lives in the battles of the late revolution, who came from\r\ntheir homes like the torrents that sweep over their native hills and\r\nmountains, those men who gathered round the sacred precincts of the\r\ntomb of Washington to uphold and perpetuate our proud heritage of\r\nliberty, intended to inflict upon the people of this District, or of\r\nthis land, the monstrous doctrine of political equality of the negro\r\nrace with the white at the ballot-box.\r\n\r\n\"No such dogma as this was ever announced by the Republican party in\r\ntheir platforms. When that party met at Chicago, in 1860, they took\r\npains to enunciate the great principle of self-government which\r\nunderlies the institutions of this country, that each State has the\r\nright to control its own domestic policy according to its own judgment\r\nexclusively. I ask the gentlemen on the other side of the house to\r\nallow the people of the District of Columbia to exercise the same\r\ngreat right of self-government, to determine by their votes at the\r\nballot-box whether they desire to inaugurate a system of political\r\nequality with the colored people of the District.\r\n\r\n\"Self-government was the great principle which impelled our fathers to\r\nprotest against the powers of King George. That was the principle\r\nwhich led the brave army of George Washington across the ice of the\r\nriver Delaware. It was the principle which struck a successful blow\r\nagainst despotism, and planted liberty upon this continent. It was the\r\nprinciple that our fathers claimed the Parliament of England had no\r\nright to invade, and drove the colonies into rebellion, because laws\r\nwere passed without their consent by a Parliament in which they were\r\nunrepresented.\r\n\r\n\"I am here to-day to plead for the white people of this District, upon\r\nthe same grounds taken by our fathers to the English Parliament, in\r\nfavor of self-government and the right of the people of the District\r\nto be heard upon this all-important question. Although we may have a\r\nlegal yet we have no moral right, according to the immutable\r\nprinciples of justice, and according to the declaration of Holy Writ,\r\nthat we should do unto others as we would they should do unto us, to\r\ninflict upon the people of this District this fiendish doctrine of\r\npolitical equality with a race that God Almighty never intended should\r\nstand upon an equal footing with the white man and woman in social or\r\ncivil life.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Farnsworth, of Illinois, replied: \"He [Mr. Rogers] says this is a\r\nwhite man's Government. 'A white man's Government!' Why, sir, did not\r\nthe Congress of the United States pass a law for enrolling into the\r\nservice of the United States the black man as well as the white man?\r\nDid not we tax the black man as well as the white man? Does he not\r\ncontribute his money as well as his blood for the protection and\r\ndefense of the Government? O, yes; and now, when the black man comes\r\nhobbling home upon his crutches and his wooden limbs, maimed for life,\r\nbleeding, crushed, wounded, is he to be told by the people who called\r\nhim into the service of the Government, 'This is a white man's\r\nGovernment; you have nothing to do with it?' Shame! I say, eternal\r\nshame upon such a doctrine, and upon the men who advocate it!\r\n\r\n\"What should be the test as to the right to exercise the elective\r\nfranchise? I contend that the only question to be asked should be, 'Is\r\nhe a man?' The test should be that of manhood, not that of color, or\r\nraces, or class. Is he endowed with conscience and reason? Is he an\r\nimmortal being? If these questions are answered in the affirmative, he\r\nhas the same right to protection that we all enjoy.\r\n\r\n\"I am in favor, Mr. Speaker, of making suffrage equal and universal. I\r\nbelieve that greater wisdom is concentrated in the decisions of the\r\nballot-box when all citizens of a certain age vote than when only a\r\npart vote. If you apply a test founded on education or intelligence,\r\nwhere will you stop? One man will say that the voter should be able to\r\nread the Constitution and to write his name; another, that he should\r\nbe acquainted with the history of the United States; another will\r\ndemand a still higher degree of education and intelligence, until you\r\nwill establish an aristocracy of wisdom, which is one of the worst\r\nkinds of aristocracy. Sir, the men who formed this Government, who\r\nbelieved in the rights of human nature, and designed the Government to\r\nprotect them, believed, I think, as I do, that when suffrage is made\r\nuniversal, you concentrate in the ballot-box a larger amount of wisdom\r\nthan when you exclude a portion of the citizens from the right of\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\n\"I grant, sir, that many of the colored men whom I would enfranchise\r\nare poor and ignorant, but we have made them so. We have oppressed\r\nthem by our laws. We have stolen them from their cradles and consigned\r\nthem to helpless slavery. The shackles are now knocked from their\r\nlimbs, and they emerge from the house of bondage and stand forth as\r\nmen. Let us now take the next grand step, a step which must commend\r\nitself to our judgment and consciences. Let us clothe these men with\r\nthe rights of freemen, and give them the power to protect their\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, as I have already remarked, we have passed through a fiery\r\nordeal. There are but few homes within our land that are not made\r\ndesolate by the loss of a son or a father. The widow and the orphan\r\nmeet us wherever we turn. The maimed and crippled soldiers of the\r\nrepublic are every-where seen. Many fair fields have become\r\ncemeteries, where molder the remains of the noble men who have laid\r\ndown their lives in defense of our Government. We thought that we had\r\nattained the crisis of our troubles during the progress of the war.\r\nBut it has been said that the ground-swell of the ocean after the\r\nstorm is often more dangerous to the mariner than the tempest itself;\r\nand I am inclined to think that this is true in reference to the\r\npresent posture of our national affairs. The storm has apparently\r\nsubsided; but, sir, if we fail to do our duty now as a nation--and\r\nthat duty is so simple that a child can understand it; no elaborate\r\nargument need enforce it, as no sophistry can conceal it; it is simply\r\nto give to one man the same rights that we give to another--if we fail\r\nnow in this our plain duty as a nation, then the ship of state is in\r\nmore peril from this ground-swell on which we are riding than it was\r\nduring the fierce tempest of war. I trust that this Congress will have\r\nthe firmness and wisdom to guide the old ship safely into the haven of\r\npeace and security. This we can do by fixing our eyes upon the guiding\r\nstar of our fathers--the equal rights of all men.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion was resumed on the following day, January 12, by Mr.\r\nDavis, of New York: \"Republican government can never rest safely, it\r\ncan never rest peacefully, upon any foundation save that of the\r\nintelligence and virtue of its subjects. No government, republican in\r\nform, was ever prosperous where its people were ignorant and debased.\r\nAnd in this Government, where our fathers paid so much attention to\r\nintelligence, to the cultivation of virtue, and to all considerations\r\nwhich should surround and guard the foundations of the republic, I am\r\nsure that we would do dishonor to their memory by conferring the\r\nfranchise upon men unfitted to receive it and unworthy to exercise it.\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly aware that in many States we have given the elective\r\nfranchise to the white man who is debased and ignorant. I regret it,\r\nbecause I think that intelligence ought always, either as to the black\r\nor the white man, to be made a test of suffrage. And I glory in the\r\nprinciples that have been established by Massachusetts, which\r\nprescribes, not that a man should have money in his purse, but that he\r\nshould have in his head a cultivated brain, the ability to read the\r\nConstitution of his country, and intelligence to understand his rights\r\nas a citizen.\r\n\r\n\"I have never been one of those who believed that the black man had\r\n'no rights that the white man was bound to respect.' I believe that\r\nthe black man in this country is entitled to citizenship, and, by\r\nvirtue of that citizenship, is entitled to protection, to the full\r\npower of this Government, wherever he may be found on the face of\r\nGod's earth; that he has a right to demand that the shield of this\r\nGovernment shall be held over him, and that its powers shall be\r\nexerted on his behalf to the same extent as if he were the proudest\r\ngrandee of the land. But, sir, citizenship is one thing, and the right\r\nof suffrage is another and a different thing; and in circumstances\r\nsuch as exist around us, I am unwilling that general, universal,\r\nunrestricted suffrage should be granted to the black men of this\r\nDistrict, as is proposed by the bill under consideration.\r\n\r\n\"This whole subject is within the power of Congress, and if we grant\r\nrestricted privilege to-day, we can extend the exercise of that\r\nprivilege to-morrow. Public sentiment on this, as on a great many\r\nsubjects, is a matter of slow growth and development. That is the\r\nhistory of the world. Development upon all great subjects is slow. The\r\ndevelopment of the globe itself has required countless ages before it\r\nwas prepared for the introduction of man upon it. And take the\r\nprogress of the human race through the historic age--kingdoms and\r\nempires, systems of social polity, systems of religion, systems of\r\nscience, have been of no rapid growth, but long centuries intervened\r\nbetween their origin and their overthrow.\r\n\r\n\"The Creator placed man on earth, not for the perfection of the\r\nindividual, but the race; and therefore he locked up the mysteries of\r\nhis power in the bosom of the earth and in the depths of the heavens,\r\nrendering them invisible to mankind. He made man study those secrets,\r\nthose mysteries, in order that his genius might be cultivated, his\r\nviews enlarged, his intellect matured, so that he might gradually rise\r\nin the scale of being, and finally attain the full perfection for\r\nwhich his Creator designed him.\r\n\r\n\"Thus governments, political systems, and political rights have been\r\nthe subjects of study and improvement; changes adapted to the advance\r\nof society are made; experiments are tried, based upon reason and upon\r\njudgment, and those are safest which in their gradual introduction\r\navoid unnecessary violence and convulsion.\r\n\r\n\"I submit, sir, whether it be wise for us now so suddenly to alter so\r\nentirely the political _status_ of so great a number of the citizens\r\nof this District, in conferring upon them indiscriminately the right\r\nof franchise.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chanler, of New York, then addressed the House:\r\n\r\n\"If, sir, it should ever be your good fortune to visit romantic old\r\nSpain, and to enter the fortress and palace of Alhambra, the fairest\r\nmonument of Moorish grandeur and skill, as this Capitol is the pride\r\nof American architecture, you may see cut in stone a hand holding a\r\nkey, surmounting the horse-shoe arch of the main gateway. They are the\r\nthree types of strength, speed, and secresy, the boast of a now fallen\r\nSaracen race, sons of that sea of sand, the desert, who carried the\r\nglory of Islam to furthest Gades. In an evil hour of civil strife and\r\nbitter hatred of faction, the Alhambra was betrayed to Spain, 'to feed\r\nfat an ancient grudge' between political chiefs. The stronghold of the\r\nrace, with the palace, the sacred courts of justice, and all the rare\r\nworks of art--the gardens of unrivaled splendor--all that was their\r\nown of majesty, strength, and beauty, became the trophies of another.\r\n\r\n\"The legend of the Saracen exile tells the story of penitence and\r\nshame; and to the last moment of his sad life he sighs in the sultry\r\ndesert for the fair home of his ancestors, the gorgeous Alhambra. We,\r\ntoo, are descended from a race of conquerors, who crossed the ocean to\r\nestablish the glory of civil and religious liberty, and secure freedom\r\nto themselves and their posterity. To-day we are assembled in the\r\nAlhambra of America; here is our citadel; here our courts of highest\r\nresort; around these halls cluster the proudest associations of the\r\nAmerican people; they seem almost sacred in their eyes. No hostile\r\nfoot of foreign foe or domestic traitor has trodden them in triumph.\r\nAbove it floats the flag, the emblem of our Union. That Union is the\r\nemblem of the triumphs of the white race. That race rules by the\r\nballot. Shall we surrender the ballot, the emblem of our sovereignty;\r\nthe flag, the emblem of our Union; the Union, the emblem of our\r\nnational glory, that they may become the badges of our weakness and\r\nthe trophies of another race? Never, sir! never, never!\r\n\r\n\"Shall the white laborer bow his free, independent, and honored brow\r\nto the level of the negro just set free from slavery, and, by yielding\r\nthe entrance to this great citadel of our nation, surrender the\r\nmastery of his race over the Representatives of the people, the\r\nSenate, and Supreme Court of this Union? Then, sir, the white\r\nworkingman's sovereignty would begin to cease to be.\r\n\r\n\"Then the most democratic majesty of American liberty would be humbled\r\nin the little dust which was lately raised by a brief campaign of two\r\nhundred thousand negro troops, and even they led by white officers,\r\nwhile millions of white soldiers held the field in victory by their\r\nown strength and valor. Deny it if ye dare! Sir, I know that this is a\r\nwhite man's Government, and I believe the white workingman has the\r\nmanhood which shall preserve it to his latest posterity, pure and\r\nstrong, in 'justice tempered with mercy.'\r\n\r\n\"There may be a legend hereafter telling of the exile of\r\nRepresentatives now on this floor, who, in the hour of party spite,\r\nbetrayed the dominion of their race here, and the stronghold of their\r\npeople's liberty, to a servile and foreign race.\"\r\n\r\nNear the close of Mr. Chanler's remarks, his time having been extended\r\nby courtesy of the House, a forensic passage at arms occurred between\r\nthat gentleman and Mr. Bingham, of Ohio. Mr. Chanler had said: \"I deny\r\nthat any obligation rests against this Government to do any thing more\r\nfor the negro than has already been done. 'On what meats doth this\r\nCæsar feed that he has grown so great?' The white soldier did as much\r\nwork as he, fought as well, died as bravely, suffered in hospitals and\r\nin the field as well as he. More than this, the white soldier fought\r\nto liberate the slave, and did do it. The white soldier did more: he\r\nfought to preserve institutions and rights endeared to him by every\r\nhallowed association; to overthrow the rebellion of his brother\r\nagainst their Commonwealth and glorious Union; to preserve the\r\nsovereignty of the people against the conspiracy of a slave\r\naristocracy, if you will; to maintain the fabric of the Government\r\nbuilt by their fathers for them and their race in every country of\r\nkindred men who, downtrodden and disenfranchised, look to this country\r\nas a sure refuge. The white soldier fought as a volunteer, as a\r\nresponsible, free, and resolute citizen, knowing for what he fought,\r\nand generously letting the slave share with him the honor, and\r\nbestowing on him more than his share of the profits of the white man's\r\nvictory over his equal and the negro's master.\r\n\r\n\"We are willing that the negro should have every protection which the\r\nlaw can throw around him, but there is a majesty which 'hedges in a\r\nking.' That he ought not to have until he shows himself 'every inch a\r\nking.'\r\n\r\n          \"'Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow.'\r\n\r\n  \"'Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have\r\n  greatness thrust upon them.'\r\n\r\n\"We are opposed to thrusting honor on the negro. He is to-day, as a\r\nrace, as dependent on the power and skill of the white race for\r\nprotection as when he was first brought from Africa. Not one act of\r\ntheirs has proved the capacity of the black race for self-government.\r\nThey have neither literature, arts, nor arms, as a race. They have\r\nnever, during all the changes of dynasties or revolution of States,\r\nrisen higher than to be the helpers of the contending parties. They\r\nhave had the same opportunity as the Indian to secure their\r\nindependence of the white race, but have never systematically even\r\nattempted it on this continent, although they have been educated with\r\nequal care, and in the same schools as the white man. Their race has\r\nbeen subject to the white man, and has submitted to the yoke.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham.--\"I understood the gentleman to say, that the colored\r\nrace had failed to strike for their rights during the late rebellion.\r\nI wish to remind the gentleman of the fact, which ought to bring a\r\nblush to the cheek of every American citizen, that at the beginning of\r\nthis great struggle, a distinguished general, who, I have no doubt,\r\nreceived the political support of the gentleman himself for the\r\nPresidency, and who, then at the head of an American army within the\r\nCommonwealth of Virginia, issued his proclamation, as general in\r\ncommand of the army, notifying the insurgents in arms against the\r\nConstitution that, if their slaves rose in revolt for their liberty,\r\nhe, Major-General McClellan, by the whole force of the army at his\r\ncommand, would crush them with an iron hand. Yet the gentleman gets up\r\nhere to-day, after a record of that sort, to cast censure upon this\r\npeople because they did not strike for their liberties against the\r\ncombined armies of the republic and the armies of treason!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chanler.--\"My honorable friend from Ohio may have made a good\r\npoint against General McClellan, but he has made none against me. I\r\nadmit that they have made successful insurrections, but my argument\r\nwas not to the effect that the negro race was not capable of the\r\nbloodiest deeds. I avoided entering into that question. I asserted\r\nthat they had made successful insurrection; that they had held the\r\nwhite race under their heel in Hayti and St. Domingo. I would only\r\nsay, with regard to this question of race, that I assert there is no\r\nrecord of the black race having proved its capacity for\r\nself-government as a race; that they have never struck a blow for\r\nfreedom, and maintained their freedom and independence as individuals\r\nwhen free. I appeal to history, and to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.\r\nBingham], and I speak as a student of history, and the representative\r\nof a race whose proudest boast is that their capacity for\r\nself-government is the only charter of their liberty. I assail no\r\nrace; I assail no man. I have taken the greatest pains to prove that\r\nthe inalienable rights of the black man are as sacred to me as those\r\ninalienable rights I have received from my God. If the gentleman\r\nmisunderstood me, I hope he will accept this explanation. If I have\r\nnot met his question, I will now yield the floor to him to continue.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham.--\"And I continue thus far, that the gentleman's speech\r\ncertainly has relation to the rights of the black man within the\r\nRepublic of the United States. What he may say of their history\r\noutside of the jurisdiction of this country, it is not very important\r\nfor me to take notice of. But inasmuch as the gentleman has seen fit,\r\nin his response to what I said, to refer to the testimony of history,\r\nI will bear witness now, by the authority of history, that this very\r\nrace of which he speaks is the only race now existing upon this planet\r\nthat ever hewed their way out of the prison-house of chattel slavery\r\nto the sunlight of personal liberty by their own unaided arm. So much\r\nfor that part of the gentleman's argument as relates to history.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chanler.--\"Does the gentleman allude now to what has been done in\r\nother lands than this? I ask the question because he says he does not\r\nlike me to go outside of the jurisdiction of this country, and I\r\ntherefore ask him not to go too far into Africa.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham.--\"I am not in Africa. I refer to what the gentleman\r\nreferred to himself. The insurrection in St. Domingo, I say, stands\r\nwithout a parallel in the history of any race now living on this\r\nearth, and I challenge the gentleman to refute that statement from\r\nhistory.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chanler.--\"That is admitted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham.--\"That is admitted. Then I want to know, with a fact like\r\nthat conceded, what sort of logic, what sort of force, what sort of\r\nreason, what sort of justice is there in the remark of the gentleman\r\nmade here in a deliberative assembly touching the question of the\r\npersonal enfranchisement of the black race, when he says in the\r\nstatement here, right in the face of that fact, that they only are\r\nentitled to their liberty who strike the blow for and maintain their\r\nliberty? They did strike the blow in Hayti, and did maintain their\r\nliberty there. They struck such a blow for liberty there as no other\r\nrace of men under like circumstances ever before struck, now\r\nrepresented by any organized community upon this planet; and that the\r\ngentleman conceded. And yet this sort of argument is to be adduced\r\nhere as reason why these people in the District of Columbia should not\r\nreceive the consideration of this House, and be protected in their\r\nrights as men. If the gentleman's remark is not adduced for that\r\npurpose, then it is altogether foreign to our inquiry. If the\r\ngentleman can assign any other reason for the introduction of any such\r\nargument as that, I should like to hear him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chanler.--\"I merely wish to say, in reply to the gentleman, that I\r\nhave read history a little further back. I remember when the British\r\nfleet and the British army held out a similar threat to the white race\r\nof this country. The proclamation of General McClellan did keep down\r\nthe negroes; and this fact proves what I assert--that they are a race\r\nto be kept under. No race capable of achieving its liberty by its own\r\nefforts, would have listened for one moment to the paper threats of\r\nall the generals in the world. The negroes listened to McClellan, and\r\nthey shrank behind the bush. They are bushmen in Africa. They are a\r\ndependent race, unwilling--I assert it from the record of\r\nhistory--unwilling to assert their independence at the risk of their\r\nlives. By their own efforts they never have attained, and I firmly\r\nbelieve they never will attain, their liberty.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham replied: \"I desire to say to the gentleman from New York,\r\nwhen he talks of being a 'student of history,' that before the\r\ntribunal of history the facts are not against me nor against the\r\ncolored race. I beg leave to say to the gentleman that these people\r\nhave borne themselves as bravely, as well, and, I may add, as wisely\r\nduring the great contest just closed, as any people to whom he can\r\npoint, situated in like circumstances, at any period of the world's\r\nhistory. They were in chains when the rebellion broke out. They\r\nconstituted but one-sixth of the whole body of the people. By the\r\nterms of the Constitution of the United States, if they lifted a hand\r\nin the assertion of their right to freedom, they were liable that\r\nmoment to be crushed by the combined power of the Republic, called\r\nout, in pursuance of the very letter of the Constitution, 'to suppress\r\ninsurrection.' Yet, notwithstanding the fact that their whole living\r\ngeneration and the generations before them, running back two\r\ncenturies, had been enslaved and brutalized, reduced to the sad and\r\nmiserable condition of chattels, which, for want of a better name, we\r\ncall a 'slave'--an article of merchandise, a thing of trade, with no\r\nacknowledged rights in the present, and denied even the hope of a\r\nheritage in the great hereafter--yet, sir, the moment that the word\r\n'Liberty' ran along your ranks, the moment that the word\r\n'Emancipation' was emblazoned upon your banners, those men who, with\r\ntheir ancestors, had been enslaved through five generations, rose as\r\none man to stand by this republic, the last hope of oppressed humanity\r\nupon the earth, until they numbered one hundred and seventy-five\r\nthousand arrayed in arms under your banners, doing firmly,\r\nunshrinkingly, and defiantly their full share in securing the final\r\nvictory of our arms. I have said this much in defense of men who had\r\nthe manhood, in the hour of the nation's trial, to strike for the flag\r\nand the unity of the republic in the tempest of the great conflict,\r\nand to stand, where brave men only could stand, on the field of poised\r\nbattle, where the earthquake and the fire led the charge. Sir, I am\r\nnot mistaken; and the record of history to which I have referred does\r\nnot, as the gentleman affirms it does, make against me.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Grinnell, of Iowa, in reply to Mr. Chanler, said: \"He [Mr.\r\nChanler] proceeds to say that they are now, as a class, dependent as\r\nwhen they were brought from their native wilds in Africa. Sir, I\r\nbelieve if the gentleman were master of all languages, if he were to\r\nattempt to put into a sentence the quintessence, the high-wines, and\r\nsublimation of an untruth, he could not have more concentrated his\r\nlanguage into a libel.\r\n\r\n\"What is the fact, sir? It is perfectly notorious that these four\r\nmillion slaves have not only taken care of themselves amid all the\r\ningenious impediments which tyrants could impose, but they have borne\r\nupon their stalwart shoulders their masters, millions of people, for a\r\ncentury. Why, sir, it seemed as impossible for a man to swim the\r\nAtlantic with Mount Atlas upon his back, or make harmonious base to\r\nthe thunders of heaven. But these men have achieved the world's\r\nwonder--coming out from the tortures of slavery, from the\r\nprison-house, untainted with dishonor or crime, and out of the war\r\nfree, noble, brave, and more worthy of their friends, always true to\r\nthe flag.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker, it was in fable that a man pointed a lion to the picture\r\nwhich represented the king of the forest prostrate, with a man's foot\r\non his neck, and asked what he thought of that. The reply was, 'Lions\r\nhave no painters.' For days the unblushing apostles of sham Democracy\r\nhave in this House drawn pictures of the ignorance and degradation of\r\nthe people of color in the District of Columbia. Had the subjects of\r\ntheir wanton defamation had a Representative here, there would have\r\nbeen a different coloring to the picture, and I would gladly leave\r\ntheir defense to the Representatives of classes who have by hundreds\r\ndarkened these galleries with their sable countenances, waiting for\r\ndays to hear the decisive vote which announces that their freedom is\r\nnot a mockery.\r\n\r\n\"Who are they to whom this bill proposes to give suffrage? They are\r\ntwenty thousand people, owning twenty-one churches, maintaining\r\nthirty-three day schools, and paying taxes on more than one and a\r\nquarter million dollars' worth of real property. Thirty per cent. of\r\ntheir number were slaves; but the census does not show that there is a\r\nDemocratic congressional district in the Union where a larger\r\nproportion of its population are found attendant at the churches or in\r\nthe schools.\r\n\r\n\"They did not follow the example of their pale-faced neighbors, to the\r\nnumber of thousands, crossing the line to join in the rebellion; but\r\nthree thousand and more of their number went into the Union army,\r\nnearly one thousand of whom, as soldiers, fell by disease and battle\r\nin the room of those who wept on Northern soil for rebel defeats, and\r\nnow decry the manhood and withhold just rights from our true national\r\ndefenders.\r\n\r\n\"In the South they were our friends. In the language of an official\r\ndispatch of Secretary Seward to Minister Adams, 'Every-where the\r\nAmerican general receives his most useful and reliable information\r\nfrom the negro, who hails his coming as the harbinger of freedom.' Not\r\none, but many, of our generals have proclaimed that the negro has\r\ngained by the bayonet the ballot. Admiral Du Pont made mention of the\r\nnegro pilot Small, who brought out the steamer Planter, mounting a\r\nrifled and siege gun, from Charleston, as a prize to us, under the\r\nvery guns of the enemy. He brought us the first trophy from Fort\r\nSumter, and information more valuable than the prize.\r\n\r\n\"The celebrated charge of the negro brigade at the conflict at Port\r\nHudson has passed into history. The position of the colored people in\r\nthe State of Iowa reflects lasting honor on their loyalty, and our\r\nbrave white soldiers would not have me withhold the facts. In the\r\nState there were between nine hundred and a thousand people of their\r\nclass subject to military duty. Of that number more than seven hundred\r\nentered the army. They put to blush the patriotism of the dominant\r\nrace in all Democratic districts. Seven-tenths of a class, without the\r\ninducement of commissions as lieutenants, captains, colonels,\r\ncommissaries, or quartermasters, braving the hate and vengeance of\r\nrebels, rushing into the deadly imminent breach in the darkest hour of\r\nour struggle! Where is the parallel to this? They had no flag; it was\r\na mockery. There was no pledge of political franchise. Does history\r\ncite us to a country where so large a per cent. of the population went\r\nforth for the national defense? It was not under the Cæsars; and\r\nHarold, in the defense of Britain, left behind him a larger per cent.\r\nof the stalwart and the strong. They were more eager to maintain the\r\nnational honor than the zealots to rescue Jerusalem from the\r\nprofanation of infidels. Not Frank or Hun, nor Huguenot or Roundhead,\r\nor mountaineer, Hungarian, or Pole, exceeded their sacrifices made\r\nwhen tardily accepted. And this is the race now asking our favor.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker, it will be one of the most joyful occasions of my life\r\nto give expression to my gratitude by voting a ballot to those who\r\nowed us so little, yet have aided us so faithfully and well. My\r\nconscience approves it as a humane act to the millions who for\r\ncenturies have groaned under a terrible realization that on the side\r\nof the oppressor there is power.\r\n\r\n\"My purpose is not to leave that heritage of shame to my children,\r\nthat I forgot those whose blood fed our rivers and crimsoned the sea,\r\nand left them outcasts in the 'land of the free,' preferring white\r\ntreason to sable loyalty. I rather vote death the penalty for the\r\nchief traitor, all honor and reward for our soldiery, and a ballot,\r\nsafety, and justice for the poor.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of January the discussion was continued by Mr. Kasson, of\r\nIowa, who said: \"Much has been said in this debate about the gallantry\r\nof the negro troops, and about the number of negro troops in the war.\r\nGentlemen have declared here so broadly that we were indebted to them\r\nfor our victories as to actually convey the impression that they won\r\nnearly all the victories accomplished by the armies of the United\r\nStates, and that to them are we indebted for the salvation of our\r\ncountry and our triumph over the rebellion.\r\n\r\n\"I do not agree with them in the extent of their praise, nor the\r\ngrounds upon which it has been placed. One gentleman, I think it was\r\nthe gentleman from Pennsylvania, speaks of our debt to the negroes,\r\nbecause they have fought our battles for us. This is a falsification\r\nof the condition of the negroes, and of the history of the country in\r\nthis particular. _Those negroes fought for their liberty_, which was\r\ninvolved in the preservation of the Union of the States. They fought\r\nwith us to accomplish the maintenance of the integrity of the country,\r\nwhich carried with it the liberty of their own race; and what would\r\nhave been said of the negroes if they had not, under such\r\ncircumstances, come forward and united with us? While I yield to the\r\nnegro troops the credit of having exhibited bravery and manhood when\r\nput to the test, I do not yield to them the exclusive or chief credit\r\nof having won the victory for the Government of my country in\r\npreserving this Union. Let us not, under false assertions of fact,\r\nsend out to the country and the world from this floor the declaration\r\nthat the white race of this country are wanting in the gallantry, the\r\ndevotion, and the patriotism which ultimately secured for our armies\r\ntriumph, and for our nation perpetuity.\r\n\r\n\"Unless intelligence exists in this country, unless schools are\r\nsupported and education diffused throughout the country, our\r\ninstitutions are not safe, and either anarchy or despotism will be the\r\nresult; and when you propose substantially to introduce at once\r\nthree-quarters of a million or a million of voters, the great mass of\r\nwhom are ignorant and unable to tell when the ballot they vote is\r\nright side up, then I protest against such an alarming infusion of\r\nignorance into the ballot-box, into that sacred palladium, as we have\r\nalways called it, of the liberties of our country. Let us introduce\r\nthem by fit degrees. Let them come in as fast as they are fit, and\r\ntheir numbers will not shock the character of our institutions.\r\n\r\n\"I turn for a single moment to call attention to the philanthropy of\r\nthe proposition. If you introduce all without regard to qualification,\r\nwithout their being able to read or write, and thus to understand the\r\nquestions on which they are to decide, what would be the effect? You\r\nwill take away from them the strongest incentive to learn to read or\r\nwrite. As a race, it is not accustomed to position and property; it\r\nhas no homesteads, it has no stake in the country; and unless they are\r\nrequired to be intelligent, and qualified to understand something\r\nabout our institutions and our laws, and the questions which are\r\nsubmitted to the people from time to time, you say then to them, 'No\r\nmatter whether or not you make progress in civilization or education,\r\nyou shall have all the rights of citizenship,' and in that way you\r\ntake away from them all special motive to education and improvement.\r\nOn the contrary, if the ability to read and write and understand the\r\nballot is made the qualification on the part of these people to\r\nexercise the right of voting, the remaining portion will see that\r\ncolor is not exclusion. They would all aspire to the qualification\r\nitself as preliminary to the act. You can submit no motive to that\r\nrace so powerful for the purpose of developing in them the education\r\nand intelligence required.\r\n\r\n\"I say, therefore, on whatever grounds you put it, whether you regard\r\nthe safety of our institutions or the light of philanthropy, you\r\nshould insist on qualifications substantially the same as those\r\nrequired in the State of Massachusetts. And let me say that, taking\r\nthe State of Massachusetts as an example of the result of general\r\nintelligence and qualified suffrage, and a careful guardianship of the\r\nballot-box, I know of no more illustrious example in this or any other\r\ncountry of its importance.\r\n\r\n\"With a credit that surpasses that of the United States, with a\r\nhistory that is surpassed by no State in the Union, with wealth that\r\nis almost fabulous in proportion to its population, with a prosperity\r\nalmost unknown in the history of the world, that State stands before\r\nus to-day in all her dignity, strength, wealth, intelligence, and\r\nvirtue. And if we, by adopting similar principles in other States, can\r\nsecure such results, we certainly have an inducement to consider well\r\nhow far this condition is to be attributed to her diffused education,\r\nand to the provisions of her constitution.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of Mr. Kasson's speech, a colloquy occurred between him\r\nand his colleague, Mr. Price, eliciting the fact that the question of\r\nnegro suffrage in Iowa had been squarely before the people of that\r\nState in the late fall election, and their vote had been in favor of\r\nthe measure by a majority of sixteen thousand.\r\n\r\nMr. Julian, of Indiana, having obtained the floor near the hour of\r\nadjournment, made his argument on the following day, when the\r\nconsideration of the question was resumed. In answer to the objection\r\nthat negro voting would \"lead to the amalgamation of the races or\r\nsocial equality,\" he said: \"On this subject there is nothing left to\r\nconjecture, and no ground for alarm. Negro suffrage has been very\r\nextensively tried in this country, and we are able to appeal to facts.\r\nNegroes had the right to vote in all the Colonies save one, under the\r\nArticles of Confederation. They voted, I believe, generally, on the\r\nquestion of adopting the Constitution of the United States. They have\r\nvoted ever since in New York and the New England States, save\r\nConnecticut, in which the practice was discontinued in 1818. They\r\nvoted in New Jersey till the year 1840; in Virginia and Maryland till\r\n1833; in Pennsylvania till 1838; in Delaware till 1831; and in North\r\nCarolina and Tennessee till 1836. I have never understood that in all\r\nthis experience of negro suffrage the amalgamation of the races was\r\nthe result. I think these evils are not at all complained of to this\r\nday in New England and New York, where negro suffrage is still\r\npracticed and recognized by law.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to the argument that a \"war of races\" might ensue, Mr.\r\nJulian said: \"Sir, a war of races in this country can only be the\r\nresult of denying to the negro his rights, just as such wars have been\r\ncaused elsewhere; and the late troubles in Jamaica should teach us, if\r\nany lesson can, the duty of dealing justly with our millions of\r\nfreedmen. Like causes must produce like results. English law made the\r\nslaves of Jamaica free, but England failed to enact other laws making\r\ntheir freedom a blessing. The old spirit of domination never died in\r\nthe slave-master, but was only maddened by emancipation. For thirty\r\nyears no measures were adopted tending to protect or educate the\r\nfreedmen. At length, and quite recently, the colonial authorities\r\npassed a whipping act, then a law of eviction for people of color,\r\nthen a law imposing heavy impost duties, bearing most grievously upon\r\nthem, and finally a law providing for the importation of coolies, thus\r\ntaxing the freedmen for the very purpose of taking the bread out of\r\nthe mouths of their own children! I believe it turns out, after all,\r\nthat these outraged people even then did not rise up against the local\r\ngovernment; but the white ruffians of the island, goaded on by their\r\nown unchecked rapacity, and availing themselves of the infernal\r\npretext of a black insurrection, perpetrated deeds of rapine and\r\nvengeance that find no parallel anywhere, save in the acts of their\r\nnatural allies, the late slave-breeding rebels, against our flag. Sir,\r\nis there no warning here against the policy of leaving our freedmen to\r\nthe tender mercies of their old masters? Are the white rebels of this\r\nDistrict any better than the Jamaica villains to whom I have referred?\r\nThe late report of General Schurz gives evidence of some important\r\nfacts which will doubtless apply here. The mass of the white people in\r\nthe South, he says, are totally destitute of any national feeling. The\r\nsame bigoted sectionalism that swayed them prior to the war is almost\r\nuniversal. Nor have they any feeling of the enormity of treason as a\r\ncrime. To them it is not odious, as very naturally it would not be,\r\nunder the policy which foregoes the punishment of traitors, and gives\r\nso many of them the chief places of power in the South. And their\r\nhatred of the negro to-day is as intense and scathing and as universal\r\nas before the war. I believe it to be even more so. The proposition to\r\neducate him and elevate his condition is every-where met with contempt\r\nand scorn. They acknowledge that slavery, as it once existed, is\r\noverthrown; but the continued inferiority and subordination of the\r\ncolored race, under some form of vassalage or serfdom, is regarded by\r\nthem as certain. Sir, they have no thought of any thing else; and if\r\nthe ballot shall be withheld from the freedmen after the withdrawal of\r\nmilitary power, the most revolting forms of oppression and outrage\r\nwill be practiced, resulting, at last, in that very war of races which\r\nis foolishly apprehended as the effect of giving the negro his\r\nrights.\"\r\n\r\nA serious question confronted Mr. Julian, namely: How could\r\nRepresentatives from States which negroes by constitutional provision\r\nare forbidden to enter, be expected, to vote for negro suffrage in\r\nthis District? He said: \"In seeking to meet this difficulty, several\r\nconsiderations must be borne in mind. In the first place, the demand\r\nfor negro suffrage in this District rests not alone upon the general\r\nground of right, of democratic equality, but upon peculiar reasons\r\nsuperinduced by the late war, which make it an immediate practical\r\nissue, involving not merely the welfare of the colored man, but the\r\nsafety of society itself. If civil government is to be revived at all\r\nin the South, it is perfectly self-evident that the loyal men there\r\nmust vote; but the loyal men are the negroes and the disloyal are the\r\nwhites. To put back the governing power into the hands of the very men\r\nwho brought on the war, and exclude those who have proved themselves\r\nthe true friends of the country, would be utterly suicidal and\r\natrociously unjust. Negro suffrage in the districts lately in revolt\r\nis thus a present political necessity, dictated by the selfishness of\r\nthe white loyalist as well as his sense of justice. But in our Western\r\nStates, in which the negro population is relatively small, and the\r\nprevailing sentiment of their white people is loyal, no such emergency\r\nexists. Society will not be endangered by the temporary postponement\r\nof the right of negro suffrage till public opinion shall render it\r\npracticable, and leaving the question of suffrage in the loyal States\r\nto be decided by them on its merits. If Indiana had gone out of her\r\nproper place in the Union, and her loyal population had been found too\r\nweak to force her back into it without negro bullets and bayonets, and\r\nif, after thus coercing her again into her constitutional orbit, her\r\nloyalists had been found unable to hold her there without negro\r\nballots, the question of negro suffrage in Indiana would most\r\nobviously have been very different from the comparatively abstract one\r\nwhich it now is. It would, it is true, have involved the question of\r\njustice to the negroes of Indiana, but the transcendently broader and\r\nmore vital question of national salvation also. Let me add further,\r\nthat should Congress pass this bill, and should the ballot be given to\r\nthe negroes in the sunny South generally, those in our Northern and\r\nWestern States, many of them at least, may return to their native land\r\nand its kindlier skies, and thus quiet the nerves of conservative\r\ngentlemen who dread too close a proximity to those whose skins, owing\r\nto some providential oversight, were somehow or other not stamped with\r\nthe true orthodox luster.\r\n\r\n\"The ballot should be given to the negroes as a matter of justice to\r\nthem. It should likewise be done as a matter of _retributive_ justice\r\nto the slaveholders and rebels. According to the best information I\r\ncan obtain, a very large majority of the white people of this District\r\nhave been rebels in heart during the war, and are rebels in heart\r\nstill. That contempt for the negro and scorn of free industry, which\r\nconstituted the mainspring of the rebellion, cropped out here during\r\nthe war in every form that was possible, under the immediate shadow of\r\nthe central Government. Meaner rebels than many in this District could\r\nscarcely have been found in the whole land. They have not been\r\npunished. The halter has been cheated out of their necks. I am very\r\nsorry to say that under what seems to be a false mercy, a misapplied\r\nhumanity, the guiltiest rebels of the war have thus far been allowed\r\nto escape justice. I have no desire to censure the authorities of the\r\nGovernment for this fact. I hope they have some valid excuse for their\r\naction. This question of punishment I know is a difficult one. The\r\nwork of punishment is so vast that it naturally palsies the will to\r\nenter upon it. It never can be thoroughly done on this side of the\r\ngrave. And were it practicable to punish adequately all the most\r\nactive and guilty rebels, justice would still remain unsatisfied. Far\r\nguiltier men than they are the rebel sympathizers of the loyal States,\r\nwho coolly stood by and encouraged their friends in the South in their\r\nwork of national rapine and murder, and while they were ever ready to\r\ngo joyfully into the service of the devil, were too cowardly to wear\r\nhis uniform and carry his weapons in open day. But Congress in this\r\nDistrict has the power to punish by ballot, and there will be a\r\nbeautiful, poetic justice in the exercise of this power. Sir, let it\r\nbe applied. The rebels here will recoil from it with horror. Some of\r\nthe worst of them, sooner than submit to black suffrage, will\r\ndoubtless leave the District, and thus render it an unspeakable\r\nservice. To be voted down and governed by Yankee and negro ballots\r\nwill seem to them an intolerable grievance, and this is among the\r\nexcellent reasons why I am in favor of it. If neither hanging nor\r\nexile can be extemporized for the entertainment of our domestic\r\nrebels, let us require them at least to make their bed on negro\r\nballots during the remainder of their unworthy lives. Of course they\r\nwill not relish it, but that will be their own peculiar concern. Their\r\ndarling institution must be charged with all the consequences of the\r\nwar. They sowed the wind, and, if required, must reap the whirlwind.\r\nRetribution follows wrong-doing, and this law must work out its\r\nresults. Rebels and their sympathizers, I am sure, will fare as well\r\nunder negro suffrage as they deserve, and I desire to leave them, as\r\nfar as practicable, in the hands of their colored brethren. Nor shall\r\nI stop to inquire very critically whether the negroes are _fit_ to\r\nvote. As between themselves and white rebels, who deserve to be hung,\r\nthey are eminently fit. I would not have them more so. Will you, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, will even my conservative and Democratic friends, be\r\nparticularly nice or fastidious in the choice of a man to vote down a\r\n_rebel_? Shall we insist upon a perfectly finished gentleman and\r\nscholar to vote down the traitors and white trash of this District,\r\nwho have recently signalized themselves by mobbing unoffending\r\nnegroes? Sir, almost any body, it seems to me, will answer the\r\npurpose. I do not pretend that the colored men here, should they get\r\nthe ballot, will not sometimes abuse it. They will undoubtedly make\r\nmistakes. In some cases they may even vote on the side of their old\r\nmasters. But I feel pretty safe in saying that even white men,\r\nperfectly free from all _suspicion_ of negro blood, have sometimes\r\nvoted on the wrong side. Sir, I appeal to gentlemen on this floor, and\r\nespecially to my Democratic friends, to say whether they can not call\r\nto mind instances in which white men have voted wrong? Indeed, it\r\nrather strikes me that white voting, ignorant, depraved, party-ridden,\r\n_Democratic_ white voting, had a good deal to do in hatching into life\r\nthe rebellion itself, and that no results of negro voting are likely\r\nto be much worse.\"\r\n\r\nAfter an hour occupied by Mr. Randall and Mr. Kelley, both of\r\nPennsylvania, in a colloquial discussion of the history and present\r\nposition of their State upon the subject of negro suffrage, Mr.\r\nThomas, of Maryland, addressed the House. After setting forth the\r\ninjustice the passage of the bill would work toward the people of his\r\nState, he said:\r\n\r\n\"If I believed that the matter of suffrage was the only mode to help\r\nthe negro in his elevation, and the only safeguard to his protection,\r\nor guarantee to his rights, I would be willing to give it to him now,\r\nsubject to proper qualifications and restrictions. But I am honest in\r\nmy conviction that, uneducated and ignorant as he is, a slave from his\r\nbirth, and subject to the will and caprice of his master, with none of\r\nthe exalted ideas of what that privilege means, and with but a faint\r\nconception of the true position he now occupies, the negro is not the\r\nproper subject to have conferred upon him this right. I believe if it\r\nis given to him, that in localities where his is the majority vote,\r\nparties will spring up, each one bidding higher than the other for his\r\nballot, and that in the end the negro-voting element will be\r\ncontrolled by a few evil and wicked politicians, and as something to\r\nbe bought and sold as freely as an article of merchandise. I am\r\nsatisfied of another fact, from my experience of the Southern negro,\r\nthat if they are ever allowed to vote, the shrewd politician of the\r\nSouth, who has been formerly his master, will exert more influence\r\nover his vote than all the exhortations from Beecher or Cheever.\r\n\r\n\"It is a notorious fact that the Southern planter maintained his\r\npolitical influence over the poor white man of the South, because the\r\npoor white man was dependent on him for his living and support. And\r\nyou will find, when it is too late, that the Southern planter will\r\nmaintain the same political influence over the poor, uneducated,\r\nignorant, and dependent African, even to a greater extent than he\r\nformerly exercised over what used to be called the 'poor white trash.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker, let us not, because we have the majority here to-day,\r\npass upon measures which, if we were evenly divided, we would hesitate\r\nto pass. Let us not, because we are called radicals, strike at the\r\nroots of society, and of the great social and political systems that\r\nhave existed for over a century, and attempt to do in a day, without\r\nany preparation, what, to do well and safely, will require years of\r\npatience on the part of the freedmen, and earnest, honest exertions to\r\nelevate, improve, and educate on our part. Let us look at this\r\nquestion as statesmen, not as partisans. Let us not suppose that the\r\nparties of to-day will have a perpetual existence, and that because\r\nthe negro, freed and emancipated by us, would naturally vote on the\r\nside of his deliverer to-day, that it is any guarantee, when new\r\nparties are formed and a competition arises, that the whole or the\r\nmajor part of his vote will be cast on the right side. White men and\r\nblack men are liable to the same infirmities.\r\n\r\n\"Let us rather, sir, rejoice at what has been already done for him,\r\nand be content to watch his future. Let us help to elevate and improve\r\nhim, not only in education, but in morals. Let us see to it that he is\r\nnot only protected in all his rights of person and of property, but\r\nlet us insist that the amplest guarantees shall be given. Let us wait\r\nuntil the great problem the African is now working out has been\r\nfinished, and we find that he thoroughly comprehends and will not\r\nabuse what he has got, before we attempt to confer other privileges,\r\nwhich, when once granted, can never be taken from him. Sir, let it not\r\nbe forgotten that 'revolutions never go backward;' and if you ever\r\nconfer this right on the negro, and find it will not work well, that\r\nyou have been too hasty, that you should have waited awhile longer,\r\nyou will find it is too late, and that, once having possessed it, they\r\nwill not part with it except with their lives.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of January the debate was resumed by Mr. Darling, of New\r\nYork, who remarked:\r\n\r\n\"What public necessity exists for the passage of this bill at this\r\ntime? There are no benefits which the colored people of this District\r\ncould attain by the exercise of the right of suffrage that Congress\r\ncould not bestow. Our right and power to legislate for this District\r\nare unquestioned, and instead of wasting days and weeks over a\r\nquestion which is exciting bitter feeling among our own people, had we\r\nnot better give our attention to matters of great national interest\r\nwhich so urgently demand speedy action on our part? Let us pass laws\r\nfor the education of the people of this District, and fit them\r\nultimately to receive the elective franchise; or, if any thing is\r\nrequired to satisfy the intense desire, manifested by some gentlemen\r\nof this House, to bestow the franchise on those not now possessed of\r\nit, give it to every soldier who served in the Union Army and was\r\nhonorably discharged, whether old or young, rich or poor, native or\r\nforeign-born, white or black, and show to the world that the American\r\npeople, recognizing the services and sufferings of their brave\r\ndefenders, give them, as a recognition, the highest and best gift of\r\nAmerican citizenship.\r\n\r\n\"If I know myself, I know that no unjust or unmanly prejudice warps my\r\njudgment or controls my action on any matter of legislation affecting\r\nthe colored race on this continent. I believe in their equality of\r\nrights before the law with the dominant race. I believe in their\r\nrights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And yet I\r\nbelieve that, before we confer upon them the political right of\r\nsuffrage, as contemplated by the bill now under consideration, we\r\nshould seek to elevate their social condition, and lift them up from\r\nthe depths of degradation and ignorance in which many of them are left\r\nby the receding waves of the sea of rebellion. There are many strong\r\nobjections to conferring upon the colored men of this District the\r\ngift of unqualified suffrage without any qualification based on\r\nintelligence. The large preponderance which they possess numerically\r\nwill inevitably lead to mischievous results. Neither would I entirely\r\ndisregard the views of the people of this District, many of whom I\r\nknow to be sound, loyal Union men.\r\n\r\n\"But I do not wish to see the Union party take any step in this\r\ndirection from which they may desire hereafter to recede. Let us first\r\nrather seek to enlighten this people, and educate them to know the\r\nvalue of the great gift of liberty which has been bestowed upon them;\r\nteach them to know that to labor is for their best interests; teach\r\nthem to learn and lead virtuous and industrious lives, in order to\r\nmake themselves respected, and encourage them to act as becomes\r\nfreemen. Then they will vote intelligently, and not be subject to the\r\ncontrol of designing men, who would seek to use them for the\r\nattainment of their own selfish ends.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Speaker, in conclusion I desire to say that, as no election\r\nwill take place in this District until next June, there can be no\r\nreason for special haste in the passage of this bill, and that there\r\nis a proposition before this House, which seems to be received with\r\nvery general favor, to create a commission for the government of this\r\ncity; and, in order to give an opportunity to mature a bill for that\r\npurpose, and have it presented for the consideration of this House, I\r\nmove the postponement of the pending bill until the first Tuesday in\r\nApril next.\"\r\n\r\nAt a previous stage of the discussion of this measure, Mr. Hale had\r\nproposed amendments to the bill. These amendments were now the subject\r\nunder discussion. They were in the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"Amend the motion to recommit by adding to that motion an\r\n     instruction to the committee to amend the bill so as to\r\n     extend the right of suffrage in the District of Columbia to\r\n     all persons coming within either of the following classes,\r\n     irrespective of caste or color, but subject only to existing\r\n     provisions and qualifications other than those founded on\r\n     caste or color, to wit:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Those who can read the Constitution of the United\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n     \"2. Those who are assessed for and pay taxes on real or\r\n     personal property within the District.\r\n\r\n     \"3. Those who have served in and been honorably discharged\r\n     from the military or naval service of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"And to restrict such right of suffrage to the classes above\r\n     named, and to include proper provisions excluding from the\r\n     right of suffrage those who have borne arms against the\r\n     United States during the late rebellion, or given aid and\r\n     comfort to said rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of Mr. Darling's remarks, in which he had moved to\r\npostpone the whole subject, Mr. Hale, of New York, having argued at\r\nconsiderable length in favor of the several clauses of his proposed\r\namendment, remarked: \"Of the details of my amendment I am by no means\r\ntenacious. I do not expect to bring every member of the House, or even\r\nevery member on this side of the House, to concur in all my own views.\r\nI desire simply to put my measures fairly before the House, and to\r\nadvocate them as I best can. I am ready and willing to yield my own\r\npreferences in matters of detail to their better judgment. More than\r\nthat, I shall not follow the example that has been set by some on this\r\nside of the House who oppose my amendment, and who claim to be the\r\npeculiar friends of negro suffrage, by proclaiming that I will adhere\r\nto the doctrine of qualified suffrage, and will join our political\r\nenemies, the Democrats, in voting down every thing else. No, sir; for\r\none, and I say it with entire frankness, I prefer a restricted and\r\nqualified suffrage substantially upon the basis that I have proposed.\r\nIf the voice of this House be otherwise--if the sentiment of this\r\nCongress be that it is more desirable that universal suffrage should\r\nbe extended to all within this District, then, for one, I say most\r\ndecidedly I am for it rather than to leave the matter in its present\r\ncondition, or to disfranchise the black race in this District.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer, of Pennsylvania, spoke as follows: \"The proposition\r\ncontained in this bill is a new proposition. It contemplates a change\r\nwhich will be a landmark in the history of this country--a landmark\r\nwhich, if it is set up, will be regarded by the present and future\r\ngenerations of men who are to inhabit this continent with pride and\r\nsatisfaction, or deplored as one of the gravest errors in the history\r\nof legislation. The bill, if it shall become a law, will be, like the\r\nlaw to amend the Constitution by abolishing slavery, the deep\r\nfoot-print of an advancing civilization, or the conspicuous monument\r\nof an unwise and pernicious experiment.\r\n\r\n\"Much has been said, on the part of those who oppose the bill, on the\r\nsubject of its injustice to the white inhabitants of the District of\r\nColumbia. Indeed, the argument on that side of the question is, when\r\ndivested of all that is immaterial, meretricious, and extravagant,\r\nreduced almost entirely to that single position. Abstract this from\r\nthe excited declamation to which you have listened, and what is left\r\nis but the old revolting argument in favor of slavery, and a selfish\r\nappeal to prejudice and ignorance. It is insisted that a majority of\r\nthe white voters of the District are opposed to the contemplated law,\r\nthat they have recently given a public expression of their opinion\r\nagainst it, and that for that reason it would be unjust and oppressive\r\nin Congress to pass this law. In my judgment, this is a question not\r\nconcerning alone the wishes and prejudices of the seven thousand\r\nvoters who dwell in this District, but involving, it may be, the\r\nhonor, the justice, the good faith, and the magnanimity of the great\r\nnation which makes this little spot the central seat of its empire and\r\nits power.\r\n\r\n\"If it concerns the honor of the United States that a certain class of\r\nits people, in a portion of its territory subject to its exclusive\r\njurisdiction and control, shall, in consideration of the change which\r\nhas taken place in its condition, and of the fidelity which it has\r\nexhibited in the midst of great and severe trials, be elevated\r\nsomewhat above the political degradation which has hitherto been its\r\nlot, shall the United States be prevented from the accomplishment of\r\nthat great and generous purpose by the handful of voters who\r\ntemporarily encamp under the shadow of the Capitol? It may be that the\r\ndetermination of a question of so much importance as this belongs\r\nrather to the people of the United States, through their\r\nRepresentatives in Congress assembled, than to the present qualified\r\nvoters of this District. Sir, the field of inquiry is much wider than\r\nthe District of Columbia, and the problem to be solved one in which\r\nnot they alone are interested. When Congress determined that the time\r\nhad come when slavery should be abolished in this District, and the\r\ncapital of the nation should no longer be disgraced by its presence,\r\ndid it pause in the great work of justice to which it laid its hand to\r\nhear from the mayor of Washington, or to inquire whether the masters\r\nwould vote for it? It is not difficult to conjecture what the fate of\r\nthat great measure would have been had its adoption or rejection\r\ndepended upon the voters of this District.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we be told, sir, that if the Representatives of the people of\r\ntwenty-five States are of the opinion that the laws and institutions\r\nwhich exist in the seat of Government of the United States ought to be\r\nchanged, that they are not to be changed because a majority of the\r\nvoters who reside here do not desire that change? Will any man say\r\nthat the voices of these seven thousand voters are to outweigh the\r\nvoices of all the constituencies of the United States in the capital\r\nof their country? I dismiss this objection, therefore, as totally\r\ndestitute of reason or weight. It is based upon a fallacy so feeble\r\nthat it is dissipated by the bare touch of the Constitution to it.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever is the duty of the United States to do, that is for their\r\ninterest to do. The two great facts written in history by the iron\r\nhand of the late war are, first, that the Union is indissoluble, and\r\nsecond, that human slavery is here forever abolished. From these two\r\nfacts consequences corresponding in importance with the facts\r\nthemselves must result: from the former, a more vigorous and powerful\r\nnationality; from the latter, the elevation and improvement of the\r\nrace liberated by the war from bondage, as well as a higher and more\r\nadvanced civilization in the region where the change has taken place.\r\nIt is impossible to say that the African race occupies to-day the same\r\nposition in American affairs and counts no more in weight than it did\r\nbefore the rebellion. You can not strike the fetters from the limbs of\r\nfour million men and leave them such as you found them. As wide as is\r\nthe interval between a freeman and a slave, so wide is the difference\r\nbetween the African race before the rebellion and after the rebellion.\r\nYou can not keep to its ancient level a race which has been released\r\nfrom servitude any more than you can keep back the ocean with your\r\nhand after you have thrown down the sea-wall which restrained its\r\nimpatient tides. Freedom is every-where in history the herald of\r\nprogress. It is written in the annals of all nations. It is a law of\r\nthe human race. Ignorance, idleness, brutality--these belong to\r\nslavery; they are her natural offspring and allies, and the gentleman\r\nfrom New York, [Mr. Chanler,] who consumed so much time in\r\ndemonstrating the comparative inferiority of the black race, answered\r\nhis own argument when he reminded us that the Constitution recognized\r\nthe negro only as a slave, and gave us the strongest reason why we\r\nshould now begin to recognize him as a freeman. Sir, I do not doubt\r\nthat the negro race is inferior to our own. That is not the question.\r\nYou do not advance an inch in the argument after you have proved that\r\npremise of your case. You must show that they are not only inferior,\r\nbut that they are so ignorant and degraded that they can not be safely\r\nintrusted with the smallest conceivable part of political power and\r\nresponsibility, and that this is the case not on the plantations of\r\nAlabama and Mississippi, but here in the District of Columbia. Nay,\r\nyou must not only prove that this is the general character of this\r\npopulation here, but that this condition is so universal and\r\nunexceptional that you can not allow them to take this first step in\r\nfreedom, although it may be hedged about with qualifications and\r\nconditions; for which of you who have opposed this measure on the\r\nground of race has proposed to give the benefit of it to such as may\r\nbe found worthy? Not one of you. And this shows that your objection is\r\nfounded really on a prejudice, although it assumes the dignity and\r\nproportions of an argument. The real question, sir, is, can we afford\r\nto be just--nay, if you please, generous--to a race whose shame has\r\nbeen washed out in the consuming fires of war, and which now stands\r\nerect and equal before the law with our own? Shall we give hope and\r\nencouragement to that race beginning, as it does now for the first\r\ntime, its career of freedom, by erecting here in the capital of the\r\nrepublic a banner inscribed with the sacred legend of the elder days,\r\n'All men are born free and equal?' or shall we unfurl in its stead\r\nthat other banner, with a strange device, around which the dissolving\r\nremnants of the Democratic party in this hall are called upon to\r\nrally, inscribed with no great sentiment of justice or generosity, but\r\nbearing upon its folds the miserable appeal of the demagogue, 'This is\r\na white man's Government?' When you inaugurate your newly-discovered\r\npolitical principle, do not forget to invite the colored troops; beat\r\nthe assembly; call out the remnants of the one hundred and eighty\r\nthousand men who marched with steady step through the flames and\r\ncarnage of war, and many of whom bear upon their bodies the honorable\r\nscars received in that unparalleled struggle and in your defense, and\r\nas you send your banner down the line, say to them, 'This is the\r\nreward of a generous country for the wounds you have received and the\r\nsufferings you have endured.'\r\n\r\n\"Shall we follow the great law to which I have referred--the law that\r\nliberty is progress--and conform our policy to the spirit of that\r\ngreat law? or shall we, governed by unreasonable and selfish\r\nprejudices, initiate a policy which will make this race our hereditary\r\nenemy, a mine beneath instead of a buttress to the edifice which you\r\nare endeavoring to repair? Sir, I do not hesitate to say that, in my\r\nopinion, it were better to follow where conscience and justice point,\r\nleaving results to a higher Power, than to shrink from an issue which\r\nit is the clear intention of Providence we shall face, or to be driven\r\nfrom our true course by the chimeras which the excited imaginations of\r\npolitical partisans have conjured up, or by the misty ghosts of\r\nlong-buried errors.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Van Horn, of New York, while willing to accept the bill as\r\noriginally presented, preferred it as modified by Mr. Hale's\r\namendments. In his speech he charged those who had opposed the bill as\r\nlaboring in the interest of slavery.\r\n\r\n\"They seem to have forgotten,\" he said, \"in their advocacy of slavery,\r\nthat we have passed through a fierce war, begun by slavery, waged\r\nagainst the Government by slavery, and solely in its interest to more\r\nthoroughly establish itself upon the Western Continent, and crush out\r\nthe best interests of freedom and humanity; and that this war, guided\r\non our part by the omnipotent arm of the Invisible, made bare in our\r\nbehalf, has resulted in a most complete overthrow of this great wrong;\r\nand by the almost omnipotent voice of the republic, as now expressed\r\nin its fundamental law, it has no right to live, much less entitled to\r\nthe right of burial, and should have no mourners in the land or going\r\nabout the streets. Such speeches as those of the gentlemen from New\r\nJersey, [Mr. Rogers,] and from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Boyer,] and my\r\ncolleague and friend, [Mr. Chanler,] who represents, with myself, in\r\npart, the Empire State, carry us back to the days and scenes before\r\nthe war, when slavery ruled supreme, not only throughout the land, by\r\nand through its hold upon power, which the people in an evil hour had\r\ngiven it, but here in these halls of legislation, where liberty and\r\nits high and noble ends ought to have been secured by just and equal\r\nlaws, and the great and paramount object of our system of government\r\ncarried out and fully developed. They seem to forget that liberty and\r\ngood government have been on trial during these five years last past\r\nof war and blood, and that they have succeeded in the mighty struggle.\r\nThey forget that Providence, in a thousand ways, during this fierce\r\nconflict, has given us evidence of his favor, and led us out of the\r\nland of bondage into a purer and higher state of freedom, where\r\nslavery, as an institution among us, is no more. Why do they labor so\r\nlong and so ardently to resurrect again into life this foul and\r\nloathsome thing? Why can not they forget their former love and\r\nattachments in this direction, and no longer cling with such undying\r\ngrasp to this dead carcass, which, by its corruptions and rottenness,\r\nhas well nigh heretofore poisoned them to the death? Why not awake to\r\nthe new order of things, and accept the results which God has worked\r\nout in our recent struggle, and not raise the weak arm of flesh to\r\nrender null and void what has thus been done, and thus attempt to turn\r\nback the flow of life which is overspreading all, and penetrating\r\nevery part of the body politic with its noble purposes and exalted\r\nhopes?\"\r\n\r\nThursday, January 18, was the last day of the discussion of this\r\nimportant measure in the House of Representatives. When the subject\r\nwas in order, Mr. Clarke, of Kansas, \"as the only Representative upon\r\nthe floor of a State whose whole history had been a continual protest\r\nagainst political injustice and wrong,\" after having advocated the\r\nbill by arguments drawn from the history of the country and the record\r\nof the negro race, remarked as follows: \"This cry of poverty and\r\nignorance is not new. I remember that those who first followed the Son\r\nof man, the Savior of the world, were not the learned rabbis, not the\r\nenlightened scholar, not the rich man or the pious Pharisee. They were\r\nthe poor and needy, the peasant and the fisherman. I remember, also,\r\nthat the more learned the slaveholder, the greater the rebel. I\r\nremember that no black skin covered so false a heart or misdirected\r\nbrain, that when the radiant banner of our nationality was near or\r\nbefore him, he did not understand its meaning, and remained loyal to\r\nits demands. The man capable of taking care of himself, of wife and\r\nchildren, and, in addition to his unrequited toil, to hold up his\r\noppressor, must have intelligence enough, in the long run, to wield\r\nthe highest means of protection we can give.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, it is for our benefit, as well as for the benefit of the\r\nproscribed class, that I vote for and support impartial manhood\r\nsuffrage in this District. We can not afford, as a nation, to keep any\r\nclass ignorant or oppress the weak. We must establish here republican\r\ngovernment. That which wrongs one man, in the end recoils on the many.\r\nSir, if we accept, as the Republican party of the Union, our true\r\nposition and our duty, we shall nobly win. If we are false and\r\nrecreant, we shall miserably fail. Let us have faith in the people and\r\nthe grand logic of a mighty revolution, and dare to do right. Class\r\nlegislation will be the inevitable result of class power; and what\r\nwould follow, so far as the colored race are concerned, let the recent\r\ntragedy of Jamaica answer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon. Sidney Clarke.]\r\n\r\n\"The principles involved in the arguments put forth on the other side\r\nof the House are not alone destructive to the rights of the\r\ndefenseless, intelligent, and patriotic colored men of this District,\r\nbut they militate with a double effect and stronger purpose against\r\nthe poor whites of the North and of the South, against the German, the\r\nIrishman, and the poor and oppressed of every race, who come to our\r\nshores to escape the oppression of despotic governments, and to seek\r\nthe protection of a Government the true theory of which reposes in\r\nevery citizen a portion of its sovereign power. Against this attempt\r\nto deny or abridge in any way the rights of the weak, the poor, and\r\nthe defenseless, and to transfer the governing power of the nation to\r\nthe favored classes, to the rich and the powerful, and thus change the\r\nvery purpose and principles of our republican system, I protest in the\r\nname of constitutional freedom, and in behalf of equal rights and\r\nequal laws.\r\n\r\n\"I protest against this stealthy innovation upon popular rights, in\r\nthe name of the toiling millions of the land; and I warn the House and\r\nthe country of the untold mischief and disaster which must come to\r\ndistract and divide the republic in the future, if we follow the\r\npernicious and destructive doctrines founded upon either the\r\nprejudices of class, caste, wealth, or power. I protest in the name of\r\na constituency whose early history was a sublime and persistent\r\nstruggle against the prejudices of pampered and arrogant ruffianism at\r\nhome, and the worse than ruffian spirit of the Administrations of\r\nPierce and Buchanan, and the Democratic traitors who at that time\r\nconstituted a majority of this House, and were engaged in preparing\r\nthe nation for its harvest of blood. We must go back to the spirit and\r\npurposes of the founders of our Government. We must accept the grand\r\nlogic of the mighty revolution from which we are now emerging. We must\r\nrepudiate, now and forever, these assaults upon the masses of the\r\npeople and upon the fundamental principles of popular rights. I accept\r\nin their full force and effect the principles of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and by constitutional amendment and law of Congress I\r\nwould stamp them with irrevocable power upon the political escutcheon\r\nof the new and regenerated republic. I would avoid the mistakes of the\r\npast, and I would spurn that cringing timidity by which, through all\r\nhistory, liberty has been sacrificed and humanity betrayed.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I hesitate not to say that if we do not gather up, in the\r\nprocess of national reconstruction, the enduring safeguards of future\r\npeace, we shall be false to our history and unmindful of the grand\r\nresponsibilities now devolving upon us. The establishment of impartial\r\nsuffrage in this District will be a fitting commencement of the work.\r\nIt will be hailed by the friends of freedom every-where as a return to\r\na policy of national justice too long delayed. In behalf of the State\r\nI have the honor to represent, and upon whose soil this contest for a\r\nlarger liberty and a nobler nationality was first submitted to the\r\narbitrament of arms, I hail this measure with feelings of satisfaction\r\nand pride. It is the legitimate result of the courage and fidelity of\r\nthe hardy pioneers of Kansas in 1856, who dared to face the\r\nblandishment of power and the arrogance and brutality of slavery when\r\ncompromisers trembled, and Northern sycophants of an oligarchic\r\ndespotism, then, as now, scowled and fretted at the progress of free\r\nprinciples.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson, of Pennsylvania, after having adduced a variety of\r\narguments against the bill, finally said: \"Sir, we hear a tremendous\r\noutcry in this House in favor of popular government and about the\r\nguarantee of the Constitution of the United States to the several\r\nStates that they shall have republican governments. How are the poor\r\npeople of this District to have a republican form of government if\r\ngentlemen who have come to this city, perhaps for the first time in\r\ntheir lives, undertake to control them as absolutely and arbitrarily\r\nas Louis Napoleon controls France or Maximilian Mexico? Gentlemen ask,\r\nWhat right have they to hold an election and express their sentiments?\r\nWhat right have they to hold such an election? Surely they ought to\r\nhave the right to petition, for their rulers are generally arbitrary\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker, it seems to me ridiculously inconsistent for gentlemen\r\nupon this floor to prate so much about a republican form of\r\ngovernment, and rise here and offer resolution after resolution about\r\nthe Monroe doctrine and the downtrodden Mexicans, while they force\r\nupon the people of this District a government not of their own choice,\r\nbecause the voter in a popular government is a governor himself. But,\r\nsir, this is only part of a grand plan. Gentlemen who dare not go\r\nbefore their white constituents and urge that a negro shall have a\r\nvote in their own States, come here and undertake to thrust negro\r\nsuffrage upon the people here. Gentlemen whose States have repudiated\r\nthe idea of giving the elective franchise to negroes, come here and\r\nare willing to give the suffrage to negroes here, as if they intended\r\nto make this little District of Columbia a sort of negro Eden; as if\r\nthey intended to say to the negroes of Virginia and Maryland and\r\nDelaware, 'You have no right to vote in these States, but if you will\r\ngo to Washington you can vote there.' I imagine I can see them\r\nswarming up from different sections of the country to this city and\r\ninquiring where the polls are. Agents, men and women, such as there\r\nare at work in this city, will no doubt be at work in these States,\r\ntelling them to pack their knapsacks and march to Washington, for on\r\nsuch a day there is to be an election, and there they will have the\r\nglorious privilege of the white man. Sir, all this doctrine is\r\ndestructive of the American system of government, which recognizes the\r\nright of no man to participate in it unless he is a citizen, which\r\nsecures to the citizen his voice in the control and management of the\r\nGovernment, and prevents those not citizens from standing in the way\r\nof the exercise of his just rights.\r\n\r\n\"This Government does not belong to any race so that it can be\r\ndivested or disposed of. The present age have no right to terminate\r\nit. It is ours to enjoy and administer, and to transmit to posterity\r\nunimpaired as we received it from the fathers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell, of Massachusetts, then addressed the House: \"When we\r\nemancipated the black people, we not only relieved ourselves from the\r\ninstitution of slavery, we not only conferred upon them freedom, but\r\nwe did more, we recognized their manhood, which, by the old\r\nConstitution and the general policy and usage of the country, had\r\nbeen, from the organization of the Government until the Emancipation\r\nProclamation, denied to all of the enslaved colored people. As a\r\nconsequence of the recognition of their manhood, certain results\r\nfollow in accordance with the principles of this Government, and they\r\nwho believe in this Government are, by necessity, forced to accept\r\nthose results as a consequence of the policy of emancipation which\r\nthey have inaugurated and for which they are responsible.\r\n\r\n\"But to say now, having given freedom to them, that they shall not\r\nenjoy the essential rights and privileges of men, is to abandon the\r\nprinciple of the proclamation of emancipation, and tacitly to admit\r\nthat the whole emancipation policy is erroneous.\r\n\r\n\"It has been suggested that it is premature to demand immediate action\r\nupon the question of negro suffrage in the District of Columbia. I am\r\nnot personally responsible for the presence of the bill at the present\r\ntime, but I am responsible for the observation that there never has\r\nbeen a day during a session of Congress since the Emancipation\r\nProclamation, ay, since the negroes of this District were emancipated,\r\nwhen it was not the duty of the Government, which, by the\r\nConstitution, is intrusted with exclusive jurisdiction in this\r\nDistrict, to confer upon the men of this District, without distinction\r\nof race or color, the rights and privileges of men. And, therefore,\r\nthere can be nothing premature in this measure, and I can not see how\r\nany one who supports the Emancipation Proclamation, which is a\r\nrecognition of the manhood of the whole colored people of this\r\ncountry, can hesitate as to his duty; and while I make no suggestion\r\nas to the duty of other men, I have a clear perception of my own. And,\r\nfirst, we are bound to treat the colored people of this District, in\r\nregard to the matter of voting, precisely as we treat white people.\r\nAnd I do not hesitate to express the opinion that if the question here\r\nto-day were whether any qualification should be imposed upon white\r\nvoters in this District, if they alone were concerned, this House\r\nwould not, ay, not ten men upon this floor would, consider whether any\r\nqualifications should be imposed or not.\r\n\r\n\"Reading and writing, or reading, as a qualification, is demanded, and\r\nan appeal is made to the example of Massachusetts. I wish gentlemen\r\nwho now appeal to Massachusetts would often appeal to her in other\r\nmatters where I can more conscientiously approve her policy. But it is\r\na different proposition in Massachusetts as a practical measure. When,\r\nten years ago, this qualification was imposed upon the people of\r\nMassachusetts, it excluded no person who was then a voter. For two\r\ncenturies we have had in Massachusetts a system of public instruction\r\nopen to the children of the whole people without money and without\r\nprice. Therefore all the people there had had opportunities for\r\neducation. Now, why should the example of such a state be quoted to\r\njustify refusing suffrage to men who have been denied the privilege of\r\neducation, and whom it has been a crime to teach? Is there no\r\ndifference?\r\n\r\n\"We are to answer for our treatment of the colored people of this\r\ncountry, and it will prove in the end impracticable to secure to men\r\nof color civil rights unless the persons who claim those rights are\r\nfortified by the political right of voting. With the right of voting,\r\nevery thing that a man ought to have or enjoy of civil rights comes to\r\nhim. Without the right to vote, he is secure in nothing. I can not\r\nconsent, after all the guards and safeguards which may be prepared for\r\nthe defense of the colored men in the enjoyment of their rights--I can\r\nnot consent that they shall be deprived of the right to protect\r\nthemselves. One hundred and eighty-six thousand of them have been in\r\nthe army of the United States. They have stood in the place of our\r\nsons and brothers and friends. They have fallen in defense of the\r\ncountry. They have earned the right to share in the Government; and if\r\nyou deny them the elective franchise, I know not how they are to be\r\nprotected. Otherwise you furnish the protection which is given to the\r\nlamb when he is commended to the wolf.\r\n\r\n\"There is an ancient history that a sparrow pursued by a hawk took\r\nrefuge in the chief assembly of Athens, in the bosom of a member of\r\nthat illustrious body, and that the senator in anger hurled it\r\nviolently from him. It fell to the ground dead, and such was the\r\nhorror and indignation of that ancient but not Christianized body--men\r\nliving in the light of nature, of reason--that they immediately\r\nexpelled the brutal Areopagite from his seat, and from the association\r\nof humane legislators.\r\n\r\n\"What will be said of us, not by Christian, but by heathen nations\r\neven, if, after accepting the blood and sacrifices of these men, we\r\nhurl them from us and allow them to be the victims of those who have\r\ntyrannized over them for centuries? I know of no crime that exceeds\r\nthis; I know of none that is its parallel; and if this country is true\r\nto itself, it will rise in the majesty of its strength and maintain a\r\npolicy, here and every-where, by which the rights of the colored\r\npeople shall be secured through their own power--in peace, the ballot;\r\nin war, the bayonet.\r\n\r\n\"It is a maxim of another language, which we may well apply to\r\nourselves, that where the voting register ends the military roster of\r\nrebellion begins; and if you leave these four million people to the\r\ncare and custody of the men who have inaugurated and carried on this\r\nrebellion, then you treasure up for untold years the elements of\r\nsocial and civil war, which must not only desolate and paralyze the\r\nSouth, but shake this Government to its very foundation.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the close of Mr. Boutwell's speech, Mr. Darling's motion to\r\npostpone and Mr. Hale's motion to amend having been rejected, a vote\r\nwas taken on the bill as reported by the committee. The bill passed by\r\na vote of one hundred and sixteen in the affirmative--fifty-four\r\nvoting in the negative.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the measure having received evidence that it would not\r\nmeet with Executive approval, and not supposing that a vote of\r\ntwo-thirds could be secured for its passage over the President's veto,\r\ndetermined not to urge it immediately through the Senate.\r\n\r\nThere was great reluctance on the part of many Senators and members of\r\nthe House to come to an open rupture with the President. They desired\r\nto defer the day of final and irreconcilable difference between\r\nCongress and the Executive. If the subject of negro suffrage in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia was kept in abeyance for a time, it was hoped\r\nthat the President's approval might meanwhile be secured to certain\r\ngreat measures for protecting the helpless and maintaining the civil\r\nrights of citizens. To accomplish these important ends, the suffrage\r\nbill was deferred many months. The will of the majority in Congress\r\nrelating to this subject did not become a law until after the opening\r\nof the second session of the Thirty-ninth Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE FREEDMEN.\r\n\r\n     Necessities of the Freedmen -- Committee in the House --\r\n     Early movement by the Senate in behalf of Freedmen --\r\n     Senator Wilson's Bill -- Occasion for it -- Mr. Cowan moves\r\n     its reference -- Mr. Reverdy Johnson advises deliberation --\r\n     A question of time with Mr. Sherman -- Mr. Trumbull promises\r\n     a more efficient bill -- Mr. Sumner presents proof of the\r\n     bad condition of affairs in the South -- Mr. Cowan and Mr.\r\n     Stewart produce the President as a witness for the defense\r\n     -- Mr. Wilson on the testimony -- \"Conservatism\" -- The bill\r\n     absorbed in greater measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe necessities of three millions and a half of persons made free as a\r\nresult of the rebellion demanded early and efficient legislation at\r\nthe hands of the Thirty-ninth Congress. In vain did the Proclamation\r\nof Emancipation break their shackles, and the constitutional amendment\r\ndeclare them free, if Congress should not \"enforce\" these important\r\nacts by \"appropriate legislation.\"\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives signified its view of the importance of\r\nthis subject by constituting an able Committee \"on Freedmen,\" with\r\nThomas D. Eliot, of Massachusetts, as its chairman. The Senate,\r\nhowever, was first to take decided steps toward the protection and\r\nrelief of freedmen. We have seen that on the first day of the session\r\nSenator Wilson, of Massachusetts, introduced a bill \"to maintain the\r\nfreedom of the inhabitants in the States declared in insurrection and\r\nrebellion by the proclamation of the President of the 1st of July,\r\n1862,\" of which the following is a copy:\r\n\r\n     _Be it enacted, etc._, That all laws, statutes, acts,\r\n     ordinances, rules and regulations, of any description\r\n     whatsoever, heretofore in force or held valid in any of the\r\n     States which were declared to be in insurrection and\r\n     rebellion by the proclamation of the President of the 1st of\r\n     July, 1862, whereby or wherein any inequality of civil\r\n     rights and immunities among the inhabitants of said States\r\n     is recognized, authorized, established, or maintained, by\r\n     reason or in consequence of any distinctions or differences\r\n     of color, race, or descent, or by reason or in consequence\r\n     of a previous condition or status of slavery or involuntary\r\n     servitude of such inhabitants, be, and are hereby, declared\r\n     null and void; and it shall be unlawful to institute, make,\r\n     ordain, or establish, in any of the aforesaid States\r\n     declared to be in insurrection and rebellion, any such law,\r\n     statute, act, ordinance, rule, or regulation, or to enforce,\r\n     or to attempt to enforce, the same.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That any person who\r\n     shall violate either of the provisions of this act shall be\r\n     deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a\r\n     fine of not less than $500 nor exceeding $10,000, and by\r\n     imprisonment not less than six months nor exceeding five\r\n     years; and it shall be the duty of the President to enforce\r\n     the provisions of this act.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of December, Mr. Wilson called up his bill, which the\r\nSenate proceeded to consider as in Committee of the Whole. The author\r\nof the bill presented reasons why it should become a law: \"A bill is\r\npending before the Legislature of South Carolina making these freedmen\r\nservants, providing that the persons for whom they labor shall be\r\ntheir masters; that the relation between them shall be the relation of\r\nmaster and servant. The bill, as originally reported, provided that\r\nthe freedmen might be educated, but that provision has already been\r\nstricken out, and the bill now lies over waiting for events here. That\r\nbill makes the colored people of South Carolina serfs, a degraded\r\nclass, the slaves of society. It is far better to be the slave of one\r\nman than to be the slave of arbitrary law. There is no doubt of the\r\nfact that in a great portion of those States the high hopes, the\r\nconfidence, and the joy expressed last spring by the freedmen, have\r\npassed away; that silence and sorrow pervade that section of the\r\ncountry, and that they are becoming distrustful and discontented. God\r\ngrant that the high-raised expectations of these loyal and deserted\r\npeople may not be blasted. God forbid that we should violate our\r\nplighted faith.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan moved the reference of the bill to the Committee on the\r\nJudiciary, but its author was unwilling that it should be so referred,\r\nsince it was highly important that action should be had upon it before\r\nthe holidays.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson said that the bill gave rise to grave questions on which\r\nit was very desirable that the deliberation of the Senate should be\r\nvery calmly advised. He objected on the ground of its indefiniteness:\r\n\"There are no particular laws designated in the bill to be repealed.\r\nAll laws existing before these States got into a condition of\r\ninsurrection, by which any difference or inequality is created or\r\nestablished, are to be repealed. What is to be the effect of that\r\nrepeal upon such laws as they exist? In some of those States, by the\r\nconstitution or by the laws, (and the constitution is equally a law,)\r\npersons of the African race are excluded from certain political\r\nprivileges. Are they to be repealed, and at once, by force of that\r\nrepeal, are they to be placed exactly upon the same footing in regard\r\nto all political privileges with that which belongs to the other class\r\nof citizens? Very many of those laws are laws passed under the police\r\npower, which has always been conceded as a power belonging to the\r\nStates--laws supposed to have been necessary in order to protect the\r\nStates themselves from insurrection. Are they to be repealed\r\nabsolutely?\r\n\r\n\"No man feels more anxious certainly than I do that the rights\r\nincident to the condition of freedom, which is now as I personally am\r\nglad to believe, the condition of the black race, should not be\r\nviolated; but I do not know that there is any more pressing need for\r\nextraordinary legislation to prevent outrages upon that class, by any\r\nthing which is occurring in the Southern States, than there is for\r\npreventing outrages in the loyal States. Crimes are being perpetrated\r\nevery day in the very justly-esteemed State from which the honorable\r\nmember comes. Hardly a paper fails to give us an account of some most\r\natrocious and horrible crime. Murders shock the sense of that\r\ncommunity and the sense of the United States very often; and it is not\r\npeculiar to Massachusetts. Moral by her education, and loving freedom\r\nand hating injustice as much as the people of any other State, she yet\r\nis unable to prevent a violation of every principle of human rights,\r\nbut we are not for that reason to legislate for her.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson replied: \"The Senator from Maryland says that cruelties and\r\ngreat crimes are committed in all sections of the country. I know it;\r\nbut we have not cruel and inhuman laws to be enforced. Sir, armed men\r\nare traversing portions of the rebel States to-day enforcing these\r\nblack laws upon men whom we have made free, and to whom we stand\r\npledged before man and God to maintain their freedom. A few months ago\r\nthese freedmen were joyous, hopeful, confident. To-day they are\r\ndistrustful, silent, and sad, and this condition has grown out of the\r\nwrongs and cruelties and oppressions that have been perpetrated upon\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman said: \"I believe it is the duty of Congress to give to the\r\nfreedmen of the Southern States ample protection in all their natural\r\nrights. With me it is a question simply of time and manner. I submit\r\nto the Senator of Massachusetts whether this is the time for the\r\nintroduction of this bill. I believe it would be wiser to postpone all\r\naction upon this subject until the proclamation of the Secretary of\r\nState shall announce that the constitutional amendment is a part of\r\nthe supreme law of the land. When that is done, there will then be, in\r\nmy judgment, no doubt of the power of Congress to pass this bill, and\r\nto make it definite and general in its terms.\r\n\r\n\"Then, as I have said, it is a question of manner. When this question\r\ncomes to be legislated upon by Congress, I do not wish it to be left\r\nto the uncertain and ambiguous language of this bill. I think that the\r\nrights which we desire to secure to the freedmen of the South should\r\nbe distinctly specified.\r\n\r\n\"The language of this bill is not sufficiently definite and distinct\r\nto inform the people of the United States of precisely the character\r\nof rights intended to be secured by it to the freedmen of the Southern\r\nStates. The bill in its terms applies only to those States which were\r\ndeclared to be in insurrection; and the same criticism would apply to\r\nthis part of it that I have already made, that it is not general in\r\nits terms.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull made some remarks of great significance, as foreshadowing\r\nimportant measures soon to occupy the attention of Congress and the\r\ncountry:\r\n\r\n\"I hold that under that second section Congress will have the\r\nauthority, when the constitutional amendment is adopted, not only to\r\npass the bill of the Senator from Massachusetts, but a bill that will\r\nbe much more efficient to protect the freedman in his rights. We may,\r\nif deemed advisable, continue the Freedman's Bureau, clothe it with\r\nadditional powers, and, if necessary, back it up with a military\r\nforce, to see that the rights of the men made free by the first clause\r\nof the constitutional amendment are protected. And, sir, when the\r\nconstitutional amendment shall have been adopted, if the information\r\nfrom the South be that the men whose liberties are secured by it are\r\ndeprived of the privilege to go and come when they please, to buy and\r\nsell when they please, to make contracts and enforce contracts, I give\r\nnotice that, if no one else does, I shall introduce a bill, and urge\r\nits passage through Congress, that will secure to those men every one\r\nof these rights; they would not be freemen without them. It is idle to\r\nsay that a man is free who can not go and come at pleasure, who can\r\nnot buy and sell, who can not enforce his rights. These are rights\r\nwhich the first clause of the constitutional amendment meant to secure\r\nto all.\"\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent day, December 20, 1865, when this subject was again\r\nbefore the Senate, Mr. Sumner spoke in its favor. Referring to the\r\nmessage of the President on the \"Condition of the Southern States,\"\r\nthe Senator said:\r\n\r\n\"When I think of what occurred yesterday in this chamber; when I call\r\nto mind the attempt to whitewash the unhappy condition of the rebel\r\nStates, and to throw the mantle of official oblivion over sickening\r\nand heart-rending outrages, where human rights are sacrificed and\r\nrebel barbarism receives a new letter of license, I feel that I ought\r\nto speak of nothing else. I stood here years ago, in the days of\r\nKansas, when a small community was surrendered to the machinations of\r\nslave-masters. I now stand here again, when, alas! an immense region,\r\nwith millions of people, has been surrendered to the machinations of\r\nslave-masters. Sir, it is the duty of Congress to arrest this fatal\r\nfury. Congress must dare to be brave; it must dare to be just.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having quoted copiously from the great Russian act by which the\r\nfreedom given to the serfs by the Emperor's proclamation \"was\r\nsecured,\" and having emphasized them as examples for American\r\nlegislation, Mr. Sumner said:\r\n\r\n\"My colleague is clearly right in introducing his bill and pressing it\r\nto a vote. The argument for it is irresistible. It is essential to\r\ncomplete emancipation. Without it emancipation will be only _half\r\ndone_. It is our duty to see that it is wholly done. Slavery must be\r\nabolished not in form only, but in substance, so that there shall be\r\nno black code; but all shall be equal before the law.\"\r\n\r\nHe then read extracts from letters and documents, showing the hostile\r\nsentiments of the people, and the unhappy condition of the colored\r\npopulation in nearly all of the rebel States, and closed by saying: \"I\r\nbring this plain story to a close. I regret that I have been\r\nconstrained to present it. I wish it were otherwise. But I should have\r\nfailed in duty had I failed to speak. Not in anger, not in vengeance,\r\nnot in harshness have I spoken; but solemnly, carefully, and for the\r\nsake of my country and humanity, that peace and reconciliation may\r\nagain prevail. I have spoken especially for the loyal citizens who are\r\nnow trodden down by rebel power. You have before you the actual\r\ncondition of the rebel States. You have heard the terrible testimony.\r\nThe blood curdles at the thought of such enormities, and especially at\r\nthe thought that the poor freedmen, to whom we owe protection, are\r\nleft to the unrestrained will of such a people smarting with defeat,\r\nand ready to wreak vengeance upon these representatives of a true\r\nloyalty. In the name of God let us protect them. Insist upon\r\nguarantees. Pass the bill now under consideration; pass any bill; but\r\ndo not let this crying injustice rage any longer. An avenging God can\r\nnot sleep while such things find countenance. If you are not ready to\r\nbe the Moses of an oppressed people, do not become its Pharaoh.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan rebuked the Senator from Massachusetts for applying the term\r\n\"whitewash\" to the message of the President. He then charged Mr.\r\nSumner with reading from \"anonymous letter-writers, from cotton\r\nagents, and people of that kind,\" and placed against them \"the\r\ntestimony of the President of the United States, not a summer soldier,\r\nor a sunshine patriot, who was a Union man, and who was in favor of\r\nthe Union at a time and in a place when there was some merit in it.\"\r\nHe then proceeded to read extracts from the President's message and\r\nGeneral Grant's report.\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent day, Mr. Stewart, of Nevada, made a speech in\r\nopposition to the positions assumed by Mr. Sumner. He declared his\r\nopinion that \"if the great mass of the people of the South are capable\r\nof the atrocities attributed to them by the anonymous witnesses\r\nparaded before this Senate, then a union of these States is\r\nimpossible; then hundreds and thousands of the bravest and best of our\r\nland have fallen to no purpose; then every house, from the gulf to the\r\nlakes, is draped in mourning without an object; then three thousand\r\nmillions of indebtedness hangs like a pall upon the pride and\r\nprosperity of the people, only to admonish us that the war was wicked,\r\nuseless, and cruel.\"\r\n\r\nAfter making the remark, \"In judging of testimony upon ordinary\r\nsubjects, we take into consideration not only the facts stated, but\r\nthe character and standing of the witness, his means of information,\r\nand last, but not least, his appearance upon the stand,\" Mr. Stewart\r\nthus spoke in behalf of the principal witness relied upon in the\r\ndefense of the South: \"In this great cause, the Senate properly called\r\nupon the chief Executive of the nation for information. Was he a\r\nwitness whose character and standing before the country would entitle\r\nhis testimony to consideration? Let the voice of a great people, who\r\nhave indorsed his patriotism and administration, answer. Were his\r\nmeans of information such as to entitle him to speak advisedly upon\r\nthis subject? Let the machinery of the Government, that collects facts\r\nfrom every department, civil and military, upon the table of the\r\nExecutive, answer. Was not his appearance before the public, in\r\ncommunicating this testimony to the Senate and the country such as to\r\nremove all grounds of suspicion? Let the exalted tone, bold and\r\nfearless statement, pure and patriotic spirit of both his messages be\r\nhis best vindication.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator's remarks were principally directed in opposition to the\r\npolicy of regarding the rebel States as \"conquered territories.\" He\r\nfinally remarked: \"I wish to be distinctly understood as not opposing\r\nthe passage of the bill. I am in favor of legislation on this subject,\r\nand such legislation as shall secure the freedom of those who were\r\nformerly slaves, and their equality before the law; and I maintain\r\nthat it can be fully secured without holding the Southern States in\r\nterritorial subjugation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson replied: \"The Senator who has just addressed us questions\r\nthe testimony adduced here by my colleague yesterday. He might as well\r\nquestion the massacre at Fort Pillow, and the cruelties perpetrated at\r\nAndersonville, where eighty-three per cent, of the men who entered the\r\nhospitals died--Andersonville, where more American soldiers lie buried\r\nthan fell throughout the Mexican war; where more American soldiers lie\r\nburied than were killed in battle of British soldiers in Wellington's\r\nfour great battles in Spain, and at Waterloo, Alma, Inkermann, and\r\nSebastopol. The Senator might as well question the atrocities of\r\nsacked Lawrence and other atrocities committed during the war. If he\r\nwill go into the Freedman's Bureau, and examine and study the official\r\nrecords of officers who, for five or six months, have taken testimony\r\nand have large volumes of sworn facts; if he will go into the office\r\nof General Holt, and read the reports there, his heart and soul will\r\nbe made sick at the wrongs man does to his fellow-man.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator, in the course of his remarks, took occasion to express\r\nhis opinion of \"conservatism:\" \"Progress is to be made only by\r\nfidelity to the great cause by which we have stood during the past\r\nfour years of bloody war. For twenty-five years we had a conflict of\r\nideas, of words, of thoughts--words and thoughts stronger than\r\ncannon-balls. We have had four years of bloody conflict. Slavery,\r\nevery thing that belongs or pertains to it, lies prostrate before us\r\nto-day, and the foot of a regenerated nation is upon it. There let it\r\nlie forever. I hope no words or thoughts of a reactionary character\r\nare to be uttered in either house of Congress. I hope nothing is to be\r\nuttered here in the name of 'conservatism,' the worst word in the\r\nEnglish language. If there is a word in the English language that\r\nmeans treachery, servility, and cowardice, it is that word\r\n'conservative.' It ought never hereafter to be on the lips of an\r\nAmerican statesman. For twenty years it has stood in America the\r\nsynonym of meanness and baseness. I have studied somewhat carefully\r\nthe political history of the country during the last fifteen or twenty\r\nyears, and I have always noticed that when I heard a man prate about\r\nbeing a conservative and about conservatism, he was about to do some\r\nmean thing. [Laughter.] I never knew it to fail; in fact, it is about\r\nthe first word a man utters when he begins to retreat.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson declared his motives in proposing this bill, and yet\r\ncheerfully acquiesced in its probable fate: \"Having read hundreds of\r\npages of records and of testimony, enough to make the heart and soul\r\nsick, I proposed this bill as a measure of humanity. I desired, before\r\nwe entered on the great questions of public policy, that we should\r\npass a simple bill annulling these cruel laws; that we should do it\r\nearly, and then proceed calmly with our legislation. That was my\r\nmotive for bringing this bill into the Senate so early in the session.\r\nMany of the difficulties occurring in the rebel States, between white\r\nmen and black men, between the old masters and the freedmen, grow out\r\nof these laws. They are executed in various parts of the States; the\r\nmilitary arrest their execution frequently, and the agents of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau set them aside; and this keeps up a continual\r\nconflict. If these obnoxious State laws were promptly annulled, it\r\nwould contribute much to the restoration of good feeling and harmony,\r\nrelieve public officers from immense labors, and the freedmen from\r\nsuffering and sorrow; and this is the opinion of the most experienced\r\nmen engaged in the Freedmen's Bureau. I have had an opportunity to\r\nconsult with and to communicate with many of the agents of the Bureau,\r\nwith teachers, officers, and persons who understand the state of\r\naffairs in those States.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, it is apparent now that the bill is not to pass at present;\r\nthat it must go over for the holidays at any rate. The constitutional\r\namendment has been adopted, and I have introduced a bill this morning\r\nbased upon that amendment, which has been referred to the committee of\r\nwhich the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Trumbull] is chairman. This bill\r\nwill go over; possibly it will not be acted upon at all. We shall\r\nprobably enter on the discussion of the broader question of annulling\r\nall the black laws in the country, and putting these people under the\r\nprotection of humane, equal, and just laws.\"\r\n\r\nThe presentiment of the author of the bill was realized. The bill\r\nnever saw the light as a law of the land. Nor was it needful that it\r\nshould. It contributed to swell the volume of other and more sweeping\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE FREEDMEN'S BUREAU BILL IN THE SENATE.\r\n\r\n     The bill introduced and referred to Judiciary Committee --\r\n     Its provisions -- Argument of Mr. Hendricks against it --\r\n     Reply of Mr. Trumbull -- Mr. Cowan's amendment -- Mr.\r\n     Guthrie wishes to relieve Kentucky from the operation of the\r\n     bill -- Mr. Creswell desires that Maryland may enjoy the\r\n     benefits of the bill -- Mr. Cowan's gratitude to God and\r\n     friendship for the negro -- Remarks by Mr. Wilson -- \"The\r\n     short gentleman's long speech\" -- Yeas and nays -- Insulting\r\n     title.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of December Mr. Trumbull gave notice that \"on some early\r\nday\" he would \"introduce a bill to enlarge the powers of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau so as to secure freedom to all persons within the\r\nUnited States, and protect every individual in the full enjoyment of\r\nthe rights of person and property, and furnish him with means for\r\ntheir vindication.\" Of the introduction of this measure, he said it\r\nwould be done \"in view of the adoption of the constitutional amendment\r\nabolishing slavery. I have never doubted that, on the adoption of that\r\namendment, it would be competent for Congress to protect every person\r\nin the United States in all the rights of person and property\r\nbelonging to a free citizen; and to secure these rights is the object\r\nof the bill which I propose to introduce. I think it important that\r\naction should be taken on this subject at an early day, for the\r\npurpose of quieting apprehensions in the minds of many friends of\r\nfreedom, lest by local legislation or a prevailing public sentiment in\r\nsome of the States, persons of the African race should continue to be\r\noppressed, and, in fact, deprived of their freedom; and for the\r\npurpose, also, of showing to those among whom slavery has heretofore\r\nexisted, that unless by local legislation they provide for the real\r\nfreedom of their former slaves, the Federal Government will, by virtue\r\nof its own authority, see that they are fully protected.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of January, 1866, the first day of the session of Congress\r\nafter the holidays, Mr. Trumbull obtained leave to introduce a bill\r\n\"to enlarge the powers of the Freedmen's Bureau.\" The bill was read\r\ntwice by its title, and as it contained provisions relating to the\r\nexercise of judicial functions by the officers and agents of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau, under certain circumstances, in the late insurgent\r\nStates, it was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of January Mr. Trumbull reported the bill from the\r\nJudiciary Committee, to whom it had been referred, with some\r\namendments of a verbal character. On the following day these\r\namendments were considered by the Senate, in Committee of the Whole,\r\nand adopted. The consideration of the bill as amended was deferred to\r\na subsequent day.\r\n\r\nThe bill provided that \"the act to establish a Bureau for the relief\r\nof Freedmen and Refugees, approved March 3, 1865, shall continue until\r\notherwise provided for by law, and shall extend to refugees and\r\nfreedmen in all parts of the United States. The President is to be\r\nauthorized to divide the section of country containing such refugees\r\nand freedmen into districts, each containing one or more States, not\r\nto exceed twelve in number, and by and with the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate, to appoint an assistant commissioner for each district,\r\nwho shall give like bond, receive the same compensation, and perform\r\nthe same duties prescribed by this act and the act to which it is an\r\namendment. The bureau may, in the discretion of the President, be\r\nplaced under a commissioner and assistant commissioners, to be\r\ndetailed from the army, in which event each officer so assigned to\r\nduty is to serve without increase of pay or allowances.\r\n\r\n\"The commissioner, with the approval of the President, is to divide\r\neach district into a number of sub-districts, not to exceed the number\r\nof counties or parishes in each State, and to assign to each\r\nsub-district at least one agent, either a citizen, officer of the\r\narmy, or enlisted man, who, if an officer, is to serve without\r\nadditional compensation or allowance, and if a citizen or enlisted\r\nman, is to receive a salary not exceeding $1,500 per annum. Each\r\nassistant commissioner may employ not exceeding six clerks, one of the\r\nthird class and five of the first class, and each agent of a\r\nsub-district may employ two clerks of the first class. The President\r\nof the United States, through the War Department and the commissioner,\r\nis to extend military jurisdiction and protection over all employés,\r\nagents, and officers of the bureau, and the Secretary of War may\r\ndirect such issues of provisions, clothing, fuel, and other supplies,\r\nincluding medical stores and transportation, and afford such aid,\r\nmedical or otherwise, as he may deem needful for the immediate and\r\ntemporary shelter and supply of destitute and suffering refugees and\r\nfreedmen, their wives and children, under such rules and regulations\r\nas he may direct.\r\n\r\n\"It is also provided that the President may, for settlement in the\r\nmanner prescribed by section four of the act to which this is an\r\namendment, reserve from sale or settlement, under the homestead or\r\npreemption laws, public lands in Florida, Mississippi, and Arkansas,\r\nnot to exceed three million acres of good land in all, the rental\r\nnamed in that section to be determined in such manner as the\r\ncommissioner shall by regulation prescribe. It proposes to confirm and\r\nmake valid the possessory titles granted in pursuance of Major-General\r\nSherman's special field order, dated at Savannah, January 16, 1865.\r\nThe commissioner, under the direction of the President, is to be\r\nempowered to purchase or rent such tracts of land in the several\r\ndistricts as may be necessary to provide for the indigent refugees and\r\nfreedmen dependent upon the Government for support; also to purchase\r\nsites and buildings for schools and asylums, to be held as United\r\nStates property until the refugees or freedmen shall purchase the\r\nsame, or they shall be otherwise disposed of by the commissioner.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever in any State or district in which the ordinary course of\r\njudicial proceedings has been interrupted by the rebellion, and\r\nwherein, in consequence of any State or local law, ordinance, police\r\nor other regulation, custom, or prejudice, any of the civil rights or\r\nimmunities belonging to white persons (including the right to make and\r\nenforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to inherit,\r\npurchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property,\r\nand to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the\r\nsecurity of person and estate), are refused or denied to negroes,\r\nmulattoes, freedmen, refugees, or any other persons, on account of\r\nrace, color, or any previous condition of slavery or involuntary\r\nservitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall\r\nhave been duly convicted, or wherein they or any of them are subjected\r\nto any other or different punishment, pains, or penalties, for the\r\ncommission of any act or offense, than are prescribed for white\r\npersons committing like acts or offenses, it is to be the duty of the\r\nPresident of the United States, through the commissioner, to extend\r\nmilitary protection and jurisdiction over all cases affecting such\r\npersons so discriminated against.\r\n\r\n\"Any person who, under color of any State or local law, ordinance,\r\npolice, or other regulation or custom, shall, in any State or district\r\nin which the ordinary course of judicial proceedings has been\r\ninterrupted by the rebellion, subject, or cause to be subjected, any\r\nnegro, mulatto, freedman, refugee, or other person, on account of race\r\nor color, or any previous condition of slavery or involuntary\r\nservitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall\r\nhave been duly convicted, or for any other cause, to the deprivation\r\nof any civil right secured to white persons, or to any other or\r\ndifferent punishment than white persons are subject to for the\r\ncommission of like acts or offenses, is to be deemed guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor, and be punished by fine not exceeding $1,000 or\r\nimprisonment not exceeding one year, or both. It is to be the duty of\r\nthe officers and agents of this bureau to take jurisdiction of and\r\nhear and determine all offenses committed against this provision; and\r\nalso of all cases affecting negroes, mulattoes, freedmen, refugees, or\r\nother persons who are discriminated against in any of the particulars\r\nmentioned in this act, under such rules and regulations as the\r\nPresident of the United States, through the War Department, may\r\nprescribe. This jurisdiction is to cease and determine whenever the\r\ndiscrimination on account of which it is conferred ceases, and is in\r\nno event to be exercised in any State in which the ordinary course of\r\njudicial proceedings has not been interrupted by the rebellion, nor in\r\nany such State after it shall have been fully restored in all its\r\nconstitutional relations to the United States, and the courts of the\r\nState and of the United States within its limits are not disturbed or\r\nstopped in the peaceable course of justice.\"\r\n\r\nOther business occupying the attention of the Senate, the\r\nconsideration of the Freedman's Bureau Bill was not practically\r\nentered upon until the 18th of January. On that day, Mr. Stewart made\r\na speech ostensibly on this bill, but really on the question of\r\nreconstruction and negro suffrage, in reply to remarks by Mr. Wade on\r\nthose subjects.\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull moved as an amendment to the bill that occupants on land\r\nunder General Sherman's special field order, dated at Savannah,\r\nJanuary 16, 1865; should be confirmed in their possessions for the\r\nperiod of three years from the date of said order, and no person\r\nshould be disturbed in said possession during the said three years\r\nunless a settlement should be made with said occupant by the owner\r\nsatisfactory to the commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull explained the circumstances under which the freedmen had\r\nobtained possessory titles to lands in Georgia, and urged the\r\npropriety of their being confirmed by Congress for three years. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I should be glad to go further. I would be glad, if we could, to\r\nsecure to these people, upon any just principle, the fee of this land;\r\nbut I do not see with what propriety we could except this particular\r\ntract of country out of all the other lands in the South, and\r\nappropriate it in fee to these parties. I think, having gone upon the\r\nland in good faith under the protection of the Government, we may\r\nprotect them there for a reasonable time; and the opinion of the\r\ncommittee was that three years would be a reasonable time.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Mr. Hendricks presented his objections to the\r\nbill in a speech of considerable length. He was followed by Mr.\r\nTrumbull in reply. As both were members of the Judiciary Committee\r\nfrom which the bill was reported, and both had carefully considered\r\nthe reasons for and against the measure, their arguments are given at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon. T. A. Hendricks, Senator from Indiana.]\r\n\r\nMr. Hendricks said: \"At the last session of Congress the original law\r\ncreating that bureau was passed. We were then in the midst of the war;\r\nvery considerable territory had been brought within the control of the\r\nUnion troops and armies, and within the scope of that territory, it\r\nwas said, there were many freedmen who must be protected by a bill of\r\nthat sort; and it was mainly upon that argument that the bill was\r\nenacted. The Senate was very reluctant to enact the law creating the\r\nbureau as it now exists. There was so much hesitancy on the part of\r\nthe Senate, that by a very large vote it refused to agree to the bill\r\nreported by the Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Sumner,] from a\r\ncommittee of conference, and I believe the honorable Senator from\r\nIllinois, [Mr. Trumbull,] who introduced this bill, himself voted\r\nagainst that bill; and why? That bill simply undertook to define the\r\npowers and duties of the Freedmen's Bureau and its agents, and the\r\nSenate would not agree to confer the powers that that bill upon its\r\nface seemed to confer, and it was voted down; and then the law as it\r\nnow stands was enacted in general terms. There was very little gained,\r\nindeed, by the Senate refusing to pass the first bill and enacting the\r\nlatter, for under the law as it passed, the Freedmen's Bureau assumed\r\nvery nearly all the jurisdiction and to exercise all the powers\r\ncontemplated in the bill reported by the Senator from Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, it is important to note very carefully the enlargement of\r\nthe powers of this bureau proposed by this bill; and in the first\r\nplace, it proposes to make the bureau permanent. The last Congress\r\nwould not agree to this. The bill that the Senate voted down did not\r\nlimit the duration of the bureau, and it was voted down, and the bill\r\nthat the Senate agreed to provided that the bureau should continue\r\nduring the war and only for one year after its termination. That was\r\nthe judgment of the Senate at the last session. What has occurred\r\nsince to change the judgment of the Senate in this important matter?\r\nWhat change in the condition of the country induces the Senate now to\r\nsay that this shall be a permanent bureau or department of the\r\nGovernment, when at the last session it said it should cease to exist\r\nwithin one year after the conclusion of the war? Why, sir, it seems to\r\nme that the country is now, and especially the Southern States are now\r\nin better condition than the Senate had reason to expect when the law\r\nwas enacted. Civil government has been restored in almost all the\r\nSouthern States; the courts are restored in many of them; in many\r\nlocalities they are exercising their jurisdiction within their\r\nparticular localities without let or hinderance; and why, I ask\r\nSenators, shall we make this bureau a perpetual and permanent\r\ninstitution of the Government when we refused to do it at the last\r\nsession?\r\n\r\n\"I ask Senators, in the first place, if they are now, with the most\r\nsatisfactory information that is before the body, willing to do that\r\nwhich they refused to do at the last session of Congress? We refused\r\nto pass the law when it proposed to establish a permanent department.\r\nShall we now, when the war is over, when the States are returning to\r\ntheir places in the Union, when the citizens are returning to their\r\nallegiance, when peace and quiet, to a very large extent, prevail over\r\nthat country, when the courts are reëstablished; is the Senate now,\r\nwith this information before it, willing to make this a permanent\r\nbureau and department of the Government?\r\n\r\n\"The next proposition of the bill is, that it shall not be confined\r\nany longer to the Southern States, but that it shall have a government\r\nover the States of the North as well as of the South. The old law\r\nallowed the President to appoint a commissioner for each of the States\r\nthat had been declared to be in rebellion--one for each of the eleven\r\nseceding States, not to exceed ten in all. This bill provides that the\r\njurisdiction of the bureau shall extend wherever, within the limits of\r\nthe United States, refugees or freedmen have gone. Indiana has not\r\nbeen a State in insurrection, and yet there are thousands of refugees\r\nand freedmen who have gone into that State within the last three\r\nyears. This bureau is to become a governing power over the State of\r\nIndiana according to the provisions of the bill. Indiana, that\r\nprovides for her own paupers, Indiana, that provides for the\r\ngovernment of her own people, may, under the provisions of this bill,\r\nbe placed under a government that our fathers never contemplated--a\r\ngovernment that must be most distasteful to freemen.\r\n\r\n\"I know it may be said that the bureau will not probably be extended\r\nto the Northern States. If it is not intended to be extended to those\r\nStates, why amend the old law so as to give this power? When the old\r\nlaw limited the jurisdiction of this bureau to the States that had\r\nbeen declared in insurrection, is it not enough that the bureau should\r\nhave included one State, the State of Kentucky, over which it had no\r\nrightful original jurisdiction? And must we now amend it so as to\r\nplace all the States of the Union within the power of this\r\nirresponsible sub-government? This is one objection that I have to the\r\nbill, and the next is the expense that it must necessarily impose upon\r\nthe people. We are asked by the Freedmen's Bureau in its estimates to\r\nappropriate $11,745,050; nearly twelve million dollars for the support\r\nof this bureau and to carry on its operations during the coming year.\r\nI will read what he says:\r\n\r\n     \"'It is estimated that the amount required for the\r\n     expenditures of the bureau for the fiscal year commencing\r\n     January, 1866, will be $11,745,050. The sum is requisite for\r\n     the following purposes:\r\n\r\n       Salaries of assistant and sub-assistant commissioners  $147,500\r\n       Salaries of clerks                                       82,800\r\n       Stationery and printing                                  63,000\r\n       Quarters and fuel                                        15,000\r\n       Clothing for distribution                             1,750,000\r\n       Commissary stores                                     4,106,250\r\n       Medical department                                      500,000\r\n       Transportation                                        1,980,000\r\n       School superintendents                                   21,000\r\n       Sites for school-houses and asylums                   3,000,000\r\n       Telegraphing                                             18,000\r\n\r\nMaking in all the sum which I have mentioned. The old system under\r\nthis law, that was before the commissioner when he made this estimate,\r\nrequires an expenditure to carry on its operations of nearly twelve\r\nmillion dollars, and that to protect, as it is called, and to govern\r\nfour millions of the people of the United States--within a few\r\nmillions of the entire cost of the Government under Mr. Adams's\r\nadministration, when the population of the States had gone up to many\r\nmillions. How is it that a department that has but a partial\r\njurisdiction over the people shall cost almost as much for the\r\nmanagement of four million people as it cost to manage the whole\r\nGovernment, for its army, its navy, its legislative and judicial\r\ndepartments, in former years? My learned friend from Kentucky suggests\r\nthat the expenses under John Quincy Adams's administration were about\r\nthirteen million dollars. What was the population of the United States\r\nat that time I am not prepared to state, but it was far above four\r\nmillions. Now, to manage four million people is to cost the people of\r\nthe United States, under the law as it stands, nearly as much as it\r\ncost the people to manage the whole affairs of the Government under\r\nthe administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n\"I hear Senators speak very frequently of the necessity of economy and\r\nretrenchment. Is this a specimen, increasing the number of officers\r\nalmost without limit, and increasing the expenditures? I think one\r\nmight be safe in saying that, if this bill passes, we can not expect\r\nto get through a year with less than $20,000,000 of an expenditure for\r\nthis bureau. But that is a mere opinion; for no man can tell until we\r\nhave the number of officers that are to be appointed under the bill\r\nprescribed in the bill itself, and this section leaves the largest\r\ndiscretion to the bureau in the appointment of officers. I appeal to\r\nSenators to know whether, at this time, when we ought to adopt a\r\nsystem of retrenchment and reform, they are willing to pass a bill\r\nwhich will so largely increase the public expenditures.\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir, when this army of officers has been organized, the bill\r\nprovides: 'And the President of the United States, through the War\r\nDepartment and the commissioner, shall extend military jurisdiction\r\nand protection over all employés, agents, and officers of this\r\nbureau.'\r\n\r\n\"Will some Senator be good enough to tell me what that means? If\r\nIndiana be declared a State within which are found refugees and\r\nfreedmen, who have escaped from the Southern States, and if Indiana\r\nhas a commissioner appointed to her, and if in each county of Indiana\r\nthere be a sub-commissioner at a salary of $1,500 a year, with two\r\nclerks with a salary of $1,200 each, and then the War Department\r\nthrows over this little army of office-holders in the State of Indiana\r\nits protection, what does that mean? The people of Indiana have been\r\nground hard under military authority and power within the last three\r\nor four years, but it was borne because it was hoped that when the war\r\nwould be closed the military power would be withdrawn from the State.\r\nUnder this bill it may be established permanently upon the people by a\r\nbody of men protected by the military power of the Government. An\r\nofficer is appointed to the State of Indiana to regulate the contracts\r\nwhich are made between the white people and the colored people of that\r\nState, and because he holds this office, not military in its\r\ncharacter, involving no military act whatever, the military throws\r\nover him its iron shield of protection. What does that mean? If this\r\nofficer shall do a great wrong and outrage to one of the people, and\r\nthe wronged citizen appeals to the court for his redress and brings\r\nhis suit for damages, does the protecting shield of the War Department\r\nprevent the prosecution of that suit and the recovery of a judgment?\r\nWhat is the protection that is thrown over this army of\r\noffice-holders? Let it be explained.\r\n\r\n\"It may be said that this is a part of the military department. That\r\nwill depend not so much upon what we call them in the law as what are\r\nthe duties imposed upon these sub-agents. It is a little difficult to\r\ntell. They are to protect the freedmen; they are to protect refugees;\r\nthey are to buy asylums and school-houses; they are to establish\r\nschools; they are to see to the contracts that are made between white\r\nmen and colored men. I want to know of the chairman of the committee\r\nthat reported this bill, in what respect these duties are military in\r\ntheir character? I can understand one thing, that it may be regarded\r\nas a war upon the liberties of the people, but I am not able to see in\r\nwhat respect the duties of these officers otherwise are military. But\r\nthis protection is to be thrown over them. I will not occupy longer\r\ntime upon that subject.\r\n\r\n\"The third section of the bill changes the letter of the law in two\r\nrespects: first, 'That the Secretary of War may direct such issues of\r\nprovisions, clothing, fuel, and other supplies, including medical\r\nstores and transportation,' etc. Those last words, 'medical stores and\r\ntransportation,' make the change in the law that is proposed in this\r\nbill. But, sir, in point of fact it makes no change in the law; for if\r\nyou will turn to the report of the commissioner of this bureau, it\r\nwill be found that the bureau, during the past six months, has been\r\nfurnishing medical supplies and transportation. A very large item in\r\nthe expenditures estimated for is transportation. But I wish to ask of\r\nthe Senator who framed this bill why we shall now provide for the\r\ntransportation of freedmen and refugees. During the war, a very large\r\nnumber of refugees came from the Southern States into the North; but\r\nthe Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau, in his report, says that\r\nthose refugees have mainly returned, and but few remain now to be\r\ncarried back from the North to the South, or who desire to be. Then\r\nwhy do we provide in this bill for transportation? Is it simply to\r\ngive the bureau the power to transport refugees and freedmen from one\r\nlocality to another at its pleasure? The necessity of carrying them\r\nfrom one section of the country to another has passed away. Is it\r\nintended by this bill that the bureau shall expend the people's money\r\nin carrying the colored people from one locality in a Southern State\r\nto another locality? I ask the Senator from Illinois, when he comes to\r\nexplain his bill, to tell us just what is the force and purpose of\r\nthis provision.\r\n\r\n\"The fourth resolution, as amended, provides for the setting apart of\r\nthree million acres of the public lands in the States of Florida,\r\nMississippi, and Arkansas for homes for the colored people. I believe\r\nthat is the only provision of the bill in which I concur. I concur in\r\nwhat was said by some Senator yesterday, that it is desirable, if we\r\never expect to do any thing substantially for the colored people, to\r\nencourage them to obtain homes, and I am willing to vote for a\r\nreasonable appropriation of the public lands for that purpose. I shall\r\nnot, therefore, occupy time in discussing that section.\r\n\r\n\"The fifth section, as amended by the proposition before the Senate,\r\nproposes to confirm the possessory right of the colored people upon\r\nthese lands for three years from the date of that order, or about two\r\nyears from this time. I like the amendment better than the original\r\nbill; for the original bill left it entirely uncertain what was\r\nconfirmed, and of course it is better that we should say one year, or\r\nthree years, or ten years, than to leave it entirely indefinite for\r\nwhat period we do confirm the possession. I have no doubt that General\r\nSherman had the power, as a military commander, at the time, to set\r\napart the abandoned lands along the coast as a place in which to leave\r\nthe colored people then surrounding his army; but that General Sherman\r\nduring the war, or that Congress after the war, except by a proceeding\r\nfor confiscation, can take the land permanently from one person and\r\ngive it to another, I do not admit; nor did General Sherman undertake\r\nto do that. In express terms, he said that they should have the right\r\nof possession; for what length of time he did not say, for the reason\r\nthat he could not say. It was a military possession that he conferred,\r\nand that possession would last only during the continuance of the\r\nmilitary occupation, and no longer. If General Sherman, by his General\r\nOrder No. 15, placed the colored people upon the lands along the coast\r\nof South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, for a temporary purpose, what\r\nwas the extent of the possessory right which he could confer? He did\r\nnot undertake to give a title for any defined period, but simply the\r\nright of possession. It is fair to construe his order as meaning only\r\nwhat he could do, giving the right of possession during military\r\noccupancy. Now, sir, the President informs us that the rebellion is\r\nsuppressed; that the war is over; that military law no longer governs\r\nin that country; but that peace is restored, and that civil law shall\r\nnow govern. What, then, is the law upon the subject? A right of\r\npossession is given by the commanding general to certain persons\r\nwithin that region of country; peace follows, and with peace comes\r\nback the right of the real owners to the possession. This possession\r\nthat the General undertook to give, according to law, could not last\r\nlonger than the military occupancy. When peace comes, the right of the\r\nowners return with it. Then how is it that Congress can undertake to\r\nsay that the property that belongs to A, B, and C, upon the islands\r\nand sea-coast of the South, shall, for two years from this date, not\r\nbelong to them, but shall belong to certain colored people? I want to\r\nknow upon what principle of law Congress can take the property of one\r\nman and give it to another.\r\n\r\n\"I know very well what may be done in the courts by a proceeding for\r\nconfiscation. I am not discussing that question. If there has been any\r\nproperty confiscated and disposed of under proceedings of\r\nconfiscation, I do not question the title here. That is purely a\r\njudicial question. But, sir, I deny that Congress can legislate the\r\nproperty of one man into the possession of another. If this section is\r\nto pass, I prefer that this confirmation shall be for three years\r\nrather than leave it in the uncertain state in which General Sherman's\r\norder left it.\r\n\r\n\"The sixth section provides, 'That the commissioners shall, under the\r\ndirection of the President, procure in the name of the United States,\r\nby grant or purchase, such lands within the districts aforesaid as may\r\nbe required for refugees and freedmen dependent on the Government for\r\nsupport; and he shall provide, or cause to be erected, suitable\r\nbuildings for asylums and schools.' Upon what principle can you\r\nauthorize the Government of the United States to buy lands for the\r\npoor people in any State of the Union? They may be very meritorious;\r\ntheir cases may appeal with great force to our sympathies; it may\r\nalmost appear necessary to prevent suffering that we should buy a home\r\nfor each poor person in the country; but where is the power of the\r\nGeneral Government to do this thing? Is it true that by this\r\nrevolution the persons and property of the people have been brought\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of Congress, and taken from without the\r\ncontrol and jurisdiction of the States? I have understood heretofore\r\nthat it has never been disputed that the duty to provide for the poor,\r\nthe insane, the blind, and all who are dependent upon society, rests\r\nupon the States, and that the power does not belong to the General\r\nGovernment. What has occurred, then, in this war that has changed the\r\nrelation of the people to the General Government to so great an extent\r\nthat Congress may become the purchasers of homes for them? If we can\r\ngo so far, I know of no limit to the powers of Congress. Here is a\r\nproposition to buy a home for each dependent freeman and refugee. The\r\nsection is not quite as strong as it might have been. It would have\r\nbeen stronger, I think, in the present state of public sentiment, if\r\nthe word 'refugee' had been left out, and if it had been only for the\r\nfreedmen, because it does not seem to be so popular now to buy a home\r\nfor a white man as to buy one for a colored man. But this bill\r\nauthorizes the officers of the Freedmen's Bureau to buy homes for\r\nwhite people and for black people only upon the ground that they are\r\ndependent. If this be the law now, there has come about a startling\r\nchange in the relation of the States and of the people to the General\r\nGovernment. I shall be very happy to hear from the learned head of the\r\nJudiciary Committee upon what principle it is that in any one single\r\ncase you may buy a home for any man, whether he be rich or poor. The\r\nGeneral Government may buy land when it is necessary for the exercise\r\nof any of its powers; but outside of that, it seems to me, there is no\r\npower within the Constitution allowing it.\r\n\r\n\"The most remarkable sections of the bill, however, are the seventh\r\nand eighth, and to those sections I will ask the very careful\r\nattention of Senators; for I think if we can pass those two sections,\r\nand make them a law, then indeed this Government can do any thing. It\r\nwill be useless to speak any longer of limitations upon the powers of\r\nthe General Government; it will be idle to speak of the reserved power\r\nof the States; State rights and State power will have passed away if\r\nwe can do what is proposed in the seventh and eighth sections of this\r\nbill. We propose, first, to legislate against the effects of 'local\r\nlaw, ordinance, police, or other regulation;' then against 'custom,'\r\nand lastly, against 'prejudice,' and to provide that 'if any of the\r\ncivil rights or immunities belonging to white persons' are denied to\r\nany person because of color, then that person shall be taken under the\r\nmilitary protection of the Government. I do not know whether that will\r\nbe understood to extend to Indiana or not. That will be a very nice\r\npoint for the bureau to decide, I presume, after the enactment of the\r\nlaw. The section limits its operation to 'any State or district in\r\nwhich the ordinary course of judicial proceedings has been interrupted\r\nby the rebellion.' It will be a little difficult to say whether in the\r\nState of Indiana and Ohio the ordinary course of judicial proceeding\r\nhas or has not been interrupted. We had some war in Indiana; we had a\r\nvery great raid through that State and some fighting; and I presume\r\nthat in some cases the proceedings of the courts were interrupted and\r\nthe courts were unable to go on with their business, so that it might\r\nbe said that even in some of the Northern States this provision of the\r\nbill would be applicable. Suppose that it were applicable to the State\r\nof Indiana, then every man in that State, who attempted to execute the\r\nconstitution and laws of the State, would be liable for a violation of\r\nthe law. We do not allow to colored people there many civil rights and\r\nimmunities which are enjoyed by the white people. It became the policy\r\nof the State in 1852 to prohibit the immigration of colored people\r\ninto that State. I am not going to discuss the question whether that\r\nwas a wise policy or not. At the time it received the approval of my\r\njudgment. Under that constitutional provision, and the laws enacted in\r\npursuance of it, a colored man coming into the State since 1852 can\r\nnot acquire a title to real estate, can not make certain contracts,\r\nand no negro man is allowed to intermarry with a white woman. These\r\nare civil rights that are denied, and yet this bill proposes, if they\r\nare still denied in any State whose courts have been interrupted by\r\nthe rebellion, the military protection of the Government shall be\r\nextended over the person who is thus denied such civil rights or\r\nimmunities.\r\n\r\n\"The next section of the bill provides punishments where any of these\r\nthings are done, where any right is denied to a colored man which\r\nunder State law is allowed to a white man. The language is very vague,\r\nand it is very difficult to say what this section will mean. If it has\r\nas broad a construction as is attempted to be given to the second\r\nsection of the constitutional amendment, I would not undertake to\r\nguess what it means. Any man who shall deny to any colored man any\r\ncivil rights secured to white persons, shall be liable to be taken\r\nbefore the officers of this bureau and to be punished according to the\r\nprovisions of this section. In the first place, now that peace is\r\nrestored, now that there is no war, now that men are no longer under\r\nmilitary rule, but are under civil rule, I want to know how such a\r\ncourt can be organized; how it is that the citizen may be arrested\r\nwithout indictment, and may be brought before the officers of this\r\nbureau and tried without a jury, tried without the forms which the\r\nConstitution requires.\r\n\r\n\"But sir, this section is most objectionable in regard to the offense\r\nthat it defines. If any portion of the law ought to be certain, it is\r\nthat which defines crime and prescribes the punishment. What is meant\r\nby this general expression, 'the deprivation of any civil right\r\nsecured to white persons?' The agent in one State may construe it to\r\nmean one thing, and the agent in another State another thing. It is\r\nbroad and comprehensive--'the deprivation of any civil right secured\r\nto white persons.' That act of deprivation is the crime that is to be\r\npunished. Take the case that I have just referred to. Suppose a\r\nminister, when called upon, should refuse to solemnize a marriage\r\nbetween a colored man and a white woman because the law of the State\r\nforbade it, would he then, refusing to recognize a civil right which\r\nis enjoyed by white persons, be liable to this punishment?\r\n\r\n\"My judgment is that, under the second section of the constitutional\r\namendment, we may pass such a law as will secure the freedom declared\r\nin the first section, but that we can not go beyond that limitation.\r\nIf a man has been, by this provision of the Constitution, made free\r\nfrom his master, and that master undertakes to make him a slave again,\r\nwe may pass such laws as are sufficient in our judgment to prevent\r\nthat act; but if the Legislature of the State denies to the citizen as\r\nhe is now called, the freedman, equal privileges with the white man, I\r\nwant to know if that Legislature, and each member of that Legislature,\r\nis responsible to the penalties prescribed in this bill? It is not an\r\nact of the old master; it is an act of the State government, which\r\ndefines and regulates the civil rights of the people.\r\n\r\n\"I regard it as very dangerous legislation. It proposes to establish a\r\ngovernment within a government--not a republic within a republic, but\r\na cruel despotism within a republic. In times of peace, in communities\r\nthat are quiet and orderly, and obedient to law, it is proposed to\r\nestablish a government not responsible to the people, the officers of\r\nwhich are not selected by the people, the officers of which need not\r\nbe of the people governed--a government more cruel, more despotic,\r\nmore dangerous to the liberties of the people than that against which\r\nour forefathers fought in the Revolution. There is nothing that these\r\nmen may not do, under this bill, to oppress the people.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if we establish courts in the Southern States, we ought to\r\nestablish courts that will be on both sides, or on neither side; but\r\nthe doctrine now is, that if a man is appointed, either to an\r\nexecutive or a judicial office, in any locality where there are\r\ncolored people, he must be on the side of the negro. I have not heard,\r\nsince Congress met, that any colored man has done a wrong in this\r\ncountry for many years; and I have scarcely heard that any white man\r\ncoming in contact with colored people has done right for a number of\r\nyears. Every body is expected to take sides for the colored man\r\nagainst the white man. If I have to take sides, it will be with the\r\nmen of my own color and my own race; but I do not wish to do that.\r\nToward these people I hope that the legislation of Congress, within\r\nthe constitutional powers of Congress, will be just and fair--just to\r\nthem and just to the white people among whom they live; that it will\r\npromote harmony among the people, and not discord; that it will\r\nrestore labor to its channels, and bring about again in those States a\r\ncondition of prosperity and happiness. Do we not all desire that? If\r\nwe do, is it well for us to inflame our passions and the passions of\r\nthe people of the North, so that their judgments shall not be equal\r\nupon the questions between these races? It is all very well for us to\r\nhave sympathy for the poor and the unfortunate, but both sides call\r\nfor our sympathy in the South. The master, who, by his wickedness and\r\nfolly, has involved himself in the troubles that now beset him, has\r\nreturned, abandoning his rebellion, and has bent down upon his humble\r\nknees and asked the forgiveness of the Government, and to be restored\r\nagain as a citizen. Can a man go further than that? He has been in\r\nmany cases pardoned by the Executive. He stands again as a citizen of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\"What relation do we desire that the people of the North shall sustain\r\ntoward these people of the South--one of harmony and accord, or of\r\nstrife and ill will? Do we want to restore commerce and trade with\r\nthem, that we shall prosper thereby as well as they, or do we wish\r\npermanent strife and division? I want this to be a Union in form,\r\nunder the Constitution of the United States, and, in fact, by the\r\nharmony of the people of the North and of the South. I believe, as\r\nGeneral Grant says, that this bureau, especially with the enlarged\r\npowers that we propose to confer upon it, will not be an instrument of\r\nconcord and harmony, but will be one of discord and strife in that\r\nsection of the country. It can not do good, but, in my judgment, will\r\ndo much harm.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing immediately upon the close of the above argument, Mr.\r\nTrumbull thus addressed the senate: \"Mr. President, I feel it\r\nincumbent on me to reply to some of the arguments presented by the\r\nSenator from Indiana against this bill. Many of the positions he has\r\nassumed will be found, upon examination, to have no foundation in\r\nfact. He has argued against provisions not contained in the bill, and\r\nhe has argued also as if he were entirely forgetful of the condition\r\nof the country and of the great war through which we have passed.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, what was the object of the Freedmen's Bureau, and why was\r\nit established? It was established to look after a large class of\r\npeople who, as the results of the war, had been thrown upon the hands\r\nof the Government, and must have perished but for its fostering care\r\nand protection. Does the Senator mean to deny the power of this\r\nGovernment to protect people under such circumstances? The Senator\r\nmust often have voted for appropriations to protect other classes of\r\npeople under like circumstances. Whenever, in the history of the\r\nGovernment, there has been thrown upon it a helpless population, which\r\nmust starve and die but for its care, the Government has never failed\r\nto provide for them. At this very session, within the last thirty\r\ndays, both houses of Congress have voted half a million dollars to\r\nfeed and clothe people during the present winter. Who were they? Many\r\nof them were Indians who had joined the rebellion, and had slain loyal\r\npeople of the country. Yes, sir, we appropriated money to feed Indians\r\nwho had been fighting against us. We did not hear the Senator's voice\r\nin opposition to that appropriation. What were the facts? It was\r\nstated by our Indian agents that the Indian tribes west of Arkansas, a\r\npart of whom had joined the rebel armies and some the Union armies,\r\nhad been driven from their country; that their property had been\r\ndestroyed; and now, the conflict of arms having ceased, they had\r\nnothing to live upon during the winter; that they would encroach upon\r\nthe white settlements; that unless provision was made for them, they\r\nwould rob, plunder, and murder the inhabitants nearest them; and\r\nCongress was called upon to appropriate money to buy them food and\r\nclothing, and we did it. We did it for rebels and traitors. Were we\r\nnot bound to do it?\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, we have thrown upon us four million people who have toiled\r\nall their lives for others; who, unlike the Indians, had no property\r\nat the beginning of the rebellion; who were never permitted to own any\r\nthing, never permitted to eat the bread their own hands had earned;\r\nmany of whom are without support, in the midst of a prejudiced and\r\nhostile population who have been struggling to overthrow the\r\nGovernment. These four million people, made free by the acts of war\r\nand the constitutional amendment, have been, wherever they could,\r\nloyal and true to the Union; and the Senator seriously asks, What\r\nauthority have we to appropriate money to take care of them? What\r\nwould he do with them? Would he allow them to starve and die? Would he\r\nturn them over to the mercy of the men who, through their whole lives,\r\nhave had their earnings, to be enslaved again? It is not the first\r\ntime that money has been appropriated to take care of the destitute\r\nand suffering African. For years it has been the law that whenever\r\npersons of African descent were brought to our shores with the\r\nintention of reducing them to slavery, the Government should, if\r\npossible, rescue and restore them to their native land; and we have\r\nappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars for this object. Can any\r\nbody deny the right to do it? Sir, humanity as well as the\r\nconstitutional obligation to suppress the slave trade required it. So\r\nnow the people relieved by our act from the control of masters who\r\nsupplied their wants that they might have their services, have a right\r\nto rely upon us for assistance till they can have time to provide for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\"This Freedmen's Bureau is not intended as a permanent institution; it\r\nis only designed to aid these helpless, ignorant, and unprotected\r\npeople until they can provide for and take care of themselves. The\r\nauthority to do this, so far as legislative sanction can give it, is\r\nto be found in the action of a previous Congress which established the\r\nbureau; but, if it were a new question, the authority for establishing\r\nsuch a bureau, in my judgment, is given by the Constitution itself;\r\nand as the Senator's whole argument goes upon the idea of peace, and\r\nthat all the consequences of the war have ceased, I shall be pardoned,\r\nI trust, if I refer to those provisions of the Constitution which, in\r\nmy judgment, authorize the exercise of this military jurisdiction; for\r\nthis bureau is a part of the military establishment not simply during\r\nthe conflict of arms, but until peace shall be firmly established and\r\nthe civil tribunals of the country shall be restored with an assurance\r\nthat they may peacefully enforce the laws without opposition.\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution of the United States declares that Congress shall\r\nhave authority 'to declare war and make rules concerning captures on\r\nland and water,' 'to raise and support armies,' 'to provide and\r\nmaintain a navy,' 'to make rules for the government and regulation of\r\nthe land and naval forces,' 'to provide for calling forth the militia\r\nto execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrection, and repel\r\ninvasion,' and 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper\r\nfor carrying into execution the foregoing powers.' It also declares\r\nthat 'the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the\r\nprivileges and immunities of citizens in the several States,' and that\r\n'the United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a\r\nrepublican form of government.' Under the exercise of these powers,\r\nthe Government has gone through a four years' conflict. It has\r\nsucceeded in putting down armed resistance to its authority. But did\r\nthe military power which was exercised to put down this armed\r\nresistance cease the moment the rebel armies were dispersed? Has the\r\nGovernment no authority to bring to punishment the authors of this\r\nrebellion after the conflict of arms has ceased? no authority to hold\r\nas prisoners, if necessary, all who have been captured with arms in\r\ntheir hands? Can it be that, the moment the rebel armies are\r\ndispersed, the military authority ceases, and they are to be turned\r\nloose to arm and organize again for another conflict against the\r\nUnion? Why, sir, it would not be more preposterous on the part of the\r\ntraveler, after having, at the peril of his life, succeeded in\r\ndisarming a highwayman by whom he was assailed, to immediately turn\r\nround and restore to the robber his weapons with which to make a new\r\nassault.\r\n\r\n\"And yet this is what some gentlemen would have this nation do with\r\nthe worse than robbers who have assailed its life. They propose, the\r\nrebel armies being overcome, that the rebels themselves shall be\r\ninstantly clothed with all the authority they possessed before the\r\nconflict, and that the inhabitants of States who for more than four\r\nyears have carried on an organized war against the Government shall at\r\nonce be invested with all the powers they had at its commencement to\r\norganize and begin it anew; nay, more, they insist that, without any\r\naction of the Government, it is the right of the inhabitants of the\r\nrebellious States, on laying down their arms, to resume their former\r\npositions in the Union, with all the rights they possessed when they\r\nbegan the war. If such are the consequences of this struggle, it is\r\nthe first conflict in the history of the world, between either\r\nindividuals or nations, from which such results have followed. What\r\nman, after being despoiled of much of his substance, his children\r\nslain, his own life periled, and his body bleeding from many wounds,\r\never restored the authors of such calamities, when within his power,\r\nto the rights they possessed before the conflict without taking some\r\nsecurity for the future.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the war powers of the Government do not cease with the\r\ndispersion of the rebel armies; they are to be continued and exercised\r\nuntil the civil authority of the Government can be established firmly\r\nand upon a sure foundation, not again to be disturbed or interfered\r\nwith. And such, sir, is the understanding of the Government. None of\r\nthe departments of the Government understand that its military\r\nauthority has ceased to operate over the rebellious States. It is but\r\na short time since the President of the United States issued a\r\nproclamation restoring the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ in\r\nthe loyal States; but did he restore it in the rebellious States?\r\nCertainly not. What authority has he to suspend the privilege of that\r\nwrit anywhere, except in pursuance of the constitutional provision\r\nallowing the writ to be suspended 'when in cases of rebellion or\r\ninvasion the public safety may require it?' Then the President\r\nunderstands that the public safety in the insurrectionary States still\r\nrequires its suspension.\r\n\r\n\"The Attorney-General, when asked, a few days ago, why Jefferson Davis\r\nwas not put upon trial, told you that, 'though active hostilities have\r\nceased, a state of war still exists over the territory in rebellion,'\r\nso that it could not be properly done. General Grant, in an order\r\nissued within a few days--which I commend to the especial\r\nconsideration of the Senator from Indiana, for it contains many of the\r\nprovisions of the bill under consideration--an order issued with the\r\napprobation of the Executive, for such an order, I apprehend, could\r\nnot have been issued without his approbation--directs 'military\r\ndivision and department commanders, whose commands embrace or are\r\ncomposed of any of the late rebellious States, and who have not\r\nalready done so, will at once issue and enforce orders protecting from\r\nprosecution or suits in the State, or municipal courts of such State,\r\nall officers and soldiers of the armies of the United States, and all\r\npersons thereto attached, or in anywise thereto belonging; subject to\r\nmilitary authority, charged with offenses for acts done in their\r\nmilitary capacity, or pursuant to orders from proper military\r\nauthority; and to protect from suit or prosecution all loyal citizens\r\nor persons charged with offenses done against the rebel forces,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, during the existence of the rebellion; and all\r\npersons, their agents and employés, charged with the occupancy of\r\nabandoned lands or plantations, or the possession or custody of any\r\nkind of property whatever, who occupied, used, possessed, or\r\ncontrolled the same, pursuant to the order of the President, or any of\r\nthe civil or military departments of the Government, and to protect\r\nthem from any penalties or damages that may have been or may be\r\npronounced or adjudged in said courts in any of such cases; and also\r\nprotecting colored persons from prosecutions, in any of said States,\r\ncharged with offenses for which white persons are not prosecuted or\r\npunished in the same manner and degree.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Saulsbury having asked whether the Senator believed that General\r\nGrant or the President had any constitutional authority to make such\r\nan order as that, Mr. Trumbull replied: \"I am very glad the Senator\r\nfrom Delaware has asked the question. I answer, he had most ample and\r\ncomplete authority. I indorse the order and every word of it. It would\r\nbe monstrous if the officers and soldiers of the army and loyal\r\ncitizens were to be subjected to suits and prosecutions for acts done\r\nin saving the republic, and that, too, at the hands of the very men\r\nwho sought its destruction. Why, had not the Lieutenant-General\r\nauthority to issue the order? Have not the civil tribunals in all the\r\nregion of country to which order applies been expelled by armed rebels\r\nand traitors? Has not the power of the Government been overthrown\r\nthere? Is it yet reëstablished? Some steps have been taken toward\r\nreëstablishing it under the authority of the military, and in no other\r\nway. If any of the State governments recently set up in the rebellious\r\nStates were to undertake to embarrass military operations, I have no\r\ndoubt they would at once be set aside by order of the Lieutenant-General,\r\nin pursuance of directions from the Executive. These governments which\r\nhave been set up act by permission of the military. They are made use\r\nof, to some extent, to preserve peace and order and enforce civil\r\nrights between parties; and, so far as they act in harmony with the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States and the orders of the\r\nmilitary commanders, they are permitted to exercise authority; but\r\nuntil those States shall be restored in all their constitutional\r\nrelations to the Union, they ought not to be permitted to exercise\r\nauthority in any other way.\r\n\r\n\"I desire the Senator from Indiana to understand that it is under this\r\nwar power that the authority of the Freedmen's Bureau is to be\r\nexercised. I do not claim that its officers can try persons for\r\noffenses without juries in States where the civil tribunals have not\r\nbeen interrupted by the rebellion. The Senator from Indiana argues\r\nagainst this bill as if it was applicable to that State. Some of its\r\nprovisions are, but most of them are not, unless the State of Indiana\r\nhas been in rebellion against the Government; and I know too many of\r\nthe brave men who have gone from that State to maintain the integrity\r\nof the Union and put down the rebellion to cast any such imputation\r\nupon her. She is a loyal and a patriotic State; her civil government\r\nhas never been usurped or overthrown by traitors, and the provisions\r\nof the seventh and eighth sections of the bill to which the Senator\r\nalludes can not, by their very terms, have any application to the\r\nState of Indiana. Let me read the concluding sentence of the eighth\r\nsection:\r\n\r\n     \"'The jurisdiction conferred by this section on the officers\r\n     and agents of this bureau to cease and determine whenever,\r\n     the discrimination on account of which it is conferred\r\n     ceases, and in no event to be exercised in any State in\r\n     which the ordinary course of judicial proceedings has not\r\n     been interrupted by the rebellion, nor in any such State\r\n     after said State shall have been fully restored in all its\r\n     constitutional relations to the United States, and the\r\n     courts of the State and of the United States within, the\r\n     same are not disturbed or stopped in the peaceable course of\r\n     justice.'\r\n\r\n\"Will the Senator from Indiana admit for a moment that the courts in\r\nhis State are now disturbed or stopped in the peaceable course of\r\njustice? If they were ever so disturbed, they are not now. Will the\r\nSenator admit that the State of Indiana does not have and exercise all\r\nits constitutional rights as one of the States of this Union? The\r\njudicial authority conferred by this bill applies to no State, not\r\neven to South Carolina, after it shall have been restored in all its\r\nconstitutional rights.\r\n\r\n\"There is no provision in the bill for the exercise of judicial\r\nauthority except in the eighth section. Rights are declared in the\r\nseventh, but the mode of protecting them is provided in the eighth\r\nsection, and the eighth section then declares explicitly that the\r\njurisdiction that is conferred shall be exercised only in States which\r\ndo not possess full constitutional rights as parts of the Union.\r\nIndiana has at all times had all the constitutional rights pertaining\r\nto any State, has them now, and therefore the officers and agents of\r\nthis bureau can take no jurisdiction of any case in the State of\r\nIndiana. It will be another question, which I will answer, and may as\r\nwell answer now, perhaps, as to what is meant by 'military\r\nprotection.'\r\n\r\n\"The second section declares that 'the President of the United States,\r\nthrough the War Department and the commissioner, shall extend military\r\njurisdiction and protection over all employés, agents, and officers of\r\nthis bureau.' He wants to know the effect of that in Indiana. This\r\nbureau is a part of the military establishment. The effect of that in\r\nIndiana is precisely the same as in every other State, and under it\r\nthe officers and agents of the Freedmen's Bureau will occupy the same\r\nposition as do the officers and soldiers of the United States Army.\r\nWhat is that? While they are subject to the Rules and Articles of War,\r\nif they chance to be in Indiana and violate her laws, they are held\r\namenable the same as any other person. The officer or soldier in the\r\nState of Indiana who commits a murder or other offense upon a citizen\r\nof Indiana, is liable to be indicted, tried, and punished, just as if\r\nhe were a civilian. When the sheriff goes with the process to arrest\r\nthe soldier or officer who has committed the offense, the military\r\nauthorities surrender him up to be tried and punished according to the\r\nlaws of the State. It has always been done, unless in time of war when\r\nthe courts were interrupted. The jurisdiction and 'protection' that is\r\nextended over these officers and agents is for the purpose of making\r\nthem subject to the Rules and Articles of War. It is necessary for\r\nthis reason: in the rebellious States civil authority is not yet fully\r\nrestored. There would be no other way of punishing them, of holding\r\nthem to accountability, of governing and controlling them, in many\r\nportions of the country; and it is because of the condition of the\r\nrebellious States, and their still being under military authority,\r\nthat it is necessary to put these officers and agents of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau under the control of the military power.\r\n\r\n\"The Senator says the original law only embraced within its provisions\r\nthe refugees in the rebellious States; and now this bill is extended\r\nto all the States, and he wants to know the reason. I will tell him.\r\nWhen the original bill was passed, slavery existed in Tennessee,\r\nKentucky, Delaware, and in various other States. Since that time, by\r\nthe constitutional amendment, it has been every-where abolished.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Saulsbury, aroused by the mention of his own State, interrupted\r\nthe speaker: \"I say, as one of the representatives of Delaware on this\r\nfloor, that she had the proud and noble character of being the first\r\nto enter the Federal Union under a Constitution formed by equals. She\r\nhas been the very last to obey a mandate, legislative or executive,\r\nfor abolishing slavery. She has been the last slaveholding State,\r\nthank God, in America, and I am one of the last slaveholders in\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull continued: \"Well, Mr. President, I do not see\r\nparticularly what the declaration of the Senator from Delaware has to\r\ndo with the question I am discussing. His State may have been the last\r\nto become free, but I presume that the State of Delaware, old as she\r\nis, being the first to adopt the Constitution, and noble as she is,\r\nwill submit to the Constitution of the United States, which declares\r\nthat there shall be no slavery within its jurisdiction.\" [Applause in\r\nthe galleries.]\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary, Mr. President, to extend the Freedmen's Bureau\r\nbeyond the rebel States in order to take in the State of Delaware,\r\n[laughter,] the loyal State of Delaware, I am happy to say, which did\r\nnot engage in this wicked rebellion; and it is necessary to protect\r\nthe freedmen in that State as well as elsewhere; and that is the\r\nreason for extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond the limits of the\r\nrebellious States.\r\n\r\n\"Now, the Senator from Indiana says it extends all over the United\r\nStates. Well, by its terms it does, though practically it can have\r\nlittle if any operation outside of the late slaveholding States. If\r\nfreedmen should congregate in large numbers at Cairo, Illinois, or at\r\nEvansville, Indiana, and become a charge upon the people of those\r\nStates, the Freedmen's Bureau would have a right to extend its\r\njurisdiction over them, provide for their wants, secure for them\r\nemployment, and place them in situations where they could provide for\r\nthemselves; and would the State of Illinois or the State of Indiana\r\nobject to that? The provisions of the bill which would interfere with\r\nthe laws of Indiana can have no operation there.\r\n\r\n\"Again, the Senator objects very much to the expense of this bureau.\r\nWhy, sir, as I have once or twice before said, it is a part of the\r\nmilitary establishment. I believe nearly all its officers at the\r\npresent time are military officers, and by the provisions of the\r\npending bill they are to receive no additional compensation when\r\nperforming duties in the Freedmen's Bureau. The bill declares that the\r\n'bureau may, in the discretion of the President, be placed under a\r\ncommissioner and assistant commissioners, to be detailed from the\r\narmy, in which event each officer so assigned to duty shall serve\r\nwithout increase of pay or allowances.'\r\n\r\n\"I shall necessarily, Mr. President, in following the Senator from\r\nIndiana, speak somewhat in a desultory manner; but I prefer to do so\r\nbecause I would rather meet the objections made directly than by any\r\ngeneral speech. I will, therefore, take up his next objection, which\r\nis to the fifth section of the bill. That section proposes to confirm\r\nfor three years the possessory titles granted by General Sherman. The\r\nSenator from Indiana admits that General Sherman had authority, when\r\nat the head of the army at Savannah, and these people were flocking\r\naround him and dependent upon him for support, to put them upon the\r\nabandoned lands; but he says that authority to put them there and\r\nmaintain them there ceased with peace. Well, sir, a sufficient answer\r\nto that would be that peace has not yet come; the effects of war are\r\nnot yet ended; the people of the States of South Carolina, Georgia,\r\nand Florida, where these lands are situated, are yet subject to\r\nmilitary control. But I deny that if peace had come the authority of\r\nthe Government to protect these people in their possessions would\r\ncease the moment it was declared. What are the facts? The owners of\r\nthese plantations had abandoned them and entered the rebel army. They\r\nwere contending against the army which General Sherman then commanded.\r\nNumerous colored people had flocked around General Sherman's army. It\r\nwas necessary that he should supply them to save them from starvation.\r\nHis commissariat was short. Here was this abandoned country, owned by\r\nmen arrayed in arms against the Government. He, it is admitted, had\r\nauthority to put these followers of his army upon these lands, and\r\nauthorize them to go to work and gain a subsistence if they could.\r\nThey went on the lands to the number of forty or fifty thousand,\r\ncommenced work, have made improvements; and now will the Senator from\r\nIndiana tell me that upon any principle of justice, humanity, or law,\r\nif peace had come when these laborers had a crop half gathered, the\r\nGovernment of the United States, having rightfully placed them in\r\npossession, and pledged its faith to protect them there for an\r\nuncertain period, could immediately have turned them off and put in\r\npossession those traitor owners who had abandoned their homes to fight\r\nagainst the Government?\r\n\r\n\"The Government having placed these people rightfully upon these\r\nlands, and they having expended their labor upon them, they had a\r\nright to be protected in their possessions, for some length of time\r\nafter peace, on the principle of equity. That is all we propose to do\r\nby this bill. The committee thought it would not be more than a\r\nreasonable protection to allow them to remain for three years, they\r\nhaving been put upon these lands destitute, without any implements of\r\nhusbandry, without cattle, horses, or any thing else with which to\r\ncultivate the land, and having, up to the present time, been able to\r\nraise very little at the expense of great labor. Perhaps the Senator\r\nthinks they ought not to remain so long. I will not dispute whether\r\nthey shall go off at the end of one year or two years. The committee\r\npropose two years more. The order was dated in January, 1865, and we\r\npropose three years from that time, which will expire in January,\r\n1868, or about two years from this time.\r\n\r\n\"On account of that provision of the bill, the Senator asks me the\r\nquestion whether the Government of the United States has the right, in\r\na time of peace, to take property from one man and give it to another.\r\nI say no. Of course the Government of the United States has no\r\nauthority, in a time of peace, by a legislative act, to say that the\r\nfarm of the Senator from Indiana shall be given to the Senator from\r\nOhio; I contend for no such principle. But following that up, the\r\nSenator wants to know by what authority you buy land or provide\r\nschool-houses for these refugees. Have we not been providing\r\nschool-houses for years? Is there a session of Congress when acts are\r\nnot passed giving away public lands for the benefit of schools? But\r\nthat does not come out of the Treasury, the Senator from Indiana will\r\nprobably answer. But how did you get the land to give away? Did you\r\nnot buy it of the Indians? Are you not appropriating, every session of\r\nCongress, money by the million to extinguish the Indian title--money\r\ncollected off his constituents and mine by taxation? We buy the land\r\nand then we give the land away for schools. Will the Senator tell me\r\nhow that differs from giving the money? Does it make any difference\r\nwhether we buy the land from the Indians and give it for the benefit\r\nof schools, or whether we buy it from some rebel and give--no, sir,\r\nuse--it for the benefit of schools, with a view ultimately of selling\r\nit for at least its cost? I believe I would rather buy from the\r\nIndian; but still, if the traitor is to be permitted to have a title,\r\nwe will buy it from him if we can purchase cheaper.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it is a matter of economy to do this. The cheapest way by which\r\nyou can save this race from starvation and destruction is to educate\r\nthem. They will then soon become self-sustaining. The report of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau shows that to-day more than seventy thousand black\r\nchildren are being taught in the schools which have been established\r\nin the South. We shall not long have to support any of these blacks\r\nout of the public Treasury if we educate and furnish them land upon\r\nwhich they can make a living for themselves. This is a very different\r\nthing from taking the land of A and giving it to B by an act of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\"But the Senator is most alarmed at those sections of this bill which\r\nconfer judicial authority upon the officers and agents of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau. He says if this authority can be exercised there is\r\nan end to all the reserved rights of the States, and this Government\r\nmay do any thing. Not at all, sir. The authority, as I have already\r\nshown, to be exercised under the seventh and eighth sections, is a\r\nmilitary authority, to be exerted only in regions of country where the\r\ncivil tribunals are overthrown, and not there after they are restored.\r\nIt is the same authority that we have been exercising all the time in\r\nthe rebellious States; it is the same authority by virtue of which\r\nGeneral Grant issued the order which I have just read. Here is a\r\nperfect and complete answer to the objection that is made to the\r\nseventh and eighth sections.\r\n\r\n\"But, says the Senator from Indiana, we have laws in Indiana\r\nprohibiting black people from marrying whites, and are you going to\r\ndisregard these laws? Are our laws enacted for the purpose of\r\npreventing amalgamation to be disregarded, and is a man to be punished\r\nbecause he undertakes to enforce them? I beg the Senator from Indiana\r\nto read the bill. One of its objects is to secure the same civil\r\nrights and subject to the same punishments persons of all races and\r\ncolors. How does this interfere with the law of Indiana preventing\r\nmarriages between whites and blacks? Are not both races treated alike\r\nby the law of Indiana? Does not the law make it just as much a crime\r\nfor a white man to marry a black woman as for a black woman to marry a\r\nwhite man, and _vice versa_? I presume there is no discrimination in\r\nthis respect, and therefore your law forbidding marriages between\r\nwhites and blacks operates alike on both races. This bill does not\r\ninterfere with it. If the negro is denied the right to marry a white\r\nperson, the white person is equally denied the right to marry the\r\nnegro. I see no discrimination against either in this respect that\r\ndoes not apply to both. Make the penalty the same on all classes of\r\npeople for the same offense, and then no one can complain.\r\n\r\n\"My object in bringing forward these bills was to bring to the\r\nattention of Congress something that was practical, something upon\r\nwhich I hoped we all could agree. I have said nothing in these bills\r\nwhich are pending, and which have been recommended by the Committee on\r\nthe Judiciary--and I speak of both of them because they have both been\r\nalluded to in this discussion--about the political rights of the\r\nnegro. On that subject it is known that there are differences of\r\nopinion, but I trust there are no differences of opinion among the\r\nfriends of the constitutional amendment, among those who are for real\r\nfreedom to the black man, as to his being entitled to equality in\r\ncivil rights. If that is not going as far as some gentlemen would\r\ndesire, I say to them it is a step in the right direction. Let us go\r\nthat far, and, going that far, we have the coöperation of the\r\nExecutive Department; for the President has told us 'Good faith\r\nrequires the security of the freedmen in their liberty and their\r\nproperty, their right to labor, and their right to claim the just\r\nreturn of their labor.'\r\n\r\n\"Such, sir, is the language of the President of the United States in\r\nhis annual message; and who in this chamber that is in favor of the\r\nfreedom of the slave is not in favor of giving him equal and exact\r\njustice before the law? Sir, we can go along hand in hand together to\r\nthe consummation of this great object of securing to every human being\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the republic equal rights before the law,\r\nand I preferred to seek for points of agreement between all the\r\ndepartments of Government, rather than to hunt for points of\r\ndivergence. I have not said any thing in my remarks about\r\nreconstruction. I have not attempted to discuss the question whether\r\nthese States are in the Union or out of the Union, and so much has\r\nbeen said upon that subject that I am almost ready to exclaim with one\r\nof old, 'I know not whether they are in the body or out of the body;\r\nGod knoweth.' It is enough for me to know that the State organizations\r\nin several States of the Union have been usurped and overthrown, and\r\nthat up to the present time no State organization has been inaugurated\r\nin either of them which the various departments of Government, or any\r\ndepartment of the Government, has recognized as placing the States in\r\nfull possession of all the constitutional rights pertaining to States\r\nin full communion with the Union.\r\n\r\n\"The Executive has not recognized any one, for he still continues to\r\nexercise military jurisdiction and to suspend the privilege of the\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_ in all of them. Congress has not recognized\r\nany of them, as we all know; and until Congress and the Executive do\r\nrecognize them, let us make use of the Freedmen's Bureau, already\r\nestablished, to protect the colored race in their rights; and when\r\nthese States shall be admitted, and the authority of the Freedmen's\r\nBureau as a court shall cease and determine, as it must when civil\r\nauthority is fully restored, let us provide, then, by other laws, for\r\nprotecting all people in their equal civil rights before the law. If\r\nwe can pass such measures, they receive executive sanction, and it\r\nshall be understood that it is the policy of the Government that the\r\nrights of the colored men are to be protected by the States if they\r\nwill, but by the Federal Government if they will not; that at all\r\nhazards, and under all circumstances, there shall be impartiality\r\namong all classes in civil rights throughout the land. If we can do\r\nthis, much of the apprehension and anxiety now existing in the loyal\r\nStates will be allayed, and a great obstacle to an early restoration\r\nof the insurgent States to their constitutional relations in the Union\r\nwill be removed.\r\n\r\n\"If the people in the rebellious States can be made to understand that\r\nit is the fixed and determined policy of the Government that the\r\ncolored people shall be protected in their civil rights, they\r\nthemselves will adopt the necessary measures to protect them; and that\r\nwill dispense with the Freedmen's Bureau and all other Federal\r\nlegislation for their protection. The design of these bills is not, as\r\nthe Senator from Indiana would have us believe, to consolidate all\r\npower in the Federal Government, or to interfere with the domestic\r\nregulations of any of the States, except so far as to carry out a\r\nconstitutional provision which is the supreme law of the land. If the\r\nStates will not do it, then it is incumbent on Congress to do it. But\r\nif the States will do it, then the Freedmen's Bureau will be removed,\r\nand the authority proposed to be given by the other bill will have no\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I trust there may be no occasion long to exercise the authority\r\nconferred by this bill. I hope that the people of the rebellious\r\nStates themselves will conform to the existing condition of things. I\r\ndo not expect them to change all their opinions and prejudices. I do\r\nnot expect them to rejoice that they have been discomfited. But they\r\nacknowledge that the war is over; they agree that they can no longer\r\ncontend in arms against the Government; they say they are willing to\r\nsubmit to its authority; they say in their State conventions that\r\nslavery shall no more exist among them. With the abolition of slavery\r\nshould go all the badges of servitude which have been enacted for its\r\nmaintenance and support. Let them all be abolished. Let the people of\r\nthe rebellious States now be as zealous and as active in the passage\r\nof laws and the inauguration of measures to elevate, develop, and\r\nimprove the negro as they have hitherto been to enslave and degrade\r\nhim. Let them do justice and deal fairly with loyal Union men in their\r\nmidst, and henceforth be themselves loyal, and this Congress will not\r\nhave adjourned till the States whose inhabitants have been engaged in\r\nthe rebellion will be restored, to their former position in the Union,\r\nand we shall all be moving on in harmony together.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day following the discussion above given, Mr. Cowan moved to\r\namend the first section of the bill so that its operation would be\r\nlimited to such States \"as have lately been in rebellion.\" In\r\nsupporting his amendment, Mr. Cowan remarked: \"I have no idea of\r\nhaving this system extended over Pennsylvania. I think that as to the\r\nfreedmen who make their appearance there, she will be able to take\r\ncare of them and provide as well for them as any bureau which can be\r\ncreated here. I wish to confine the operation of this institution to\r\nthe States which have been lately in rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Trumbull replied: \"The Senator from Pennsylvania will see\r\nthat the effect of that would be to exclude from the operation of the\r\nbureau the State of Kentucky and the State of Delaware, where the\r\nslaves have been emancipated by the constitutional amendment. The\r\noperation of the bureau will undoubtedly be chiefly confined to the\r\nStates where slavery existed; but it is a fact which may not be known\r\nto the Senator from Pennsylvania, that during this war large numbers\r\nof slaves have fled to the Northern States bordering on the\r\nslaveholding territory.\r\n\r\n\"It is not supposed that the bill will have any effect in the State of\r\nPennsylvania or in the State of Illinois, unless it might, perhaps, be\r\nat Cairo, where there has been a large number of these refugees\r\ncongregated, without any means of support; they followed the army\r\nthere at different times.\r\n\r\n\"The provision of the bill in regard to holding courts, and some other\r\nprovisions, are confined entirely to the rebellious States, and will\r\nhave no operation in any State which was not in insurrection against\r\nthis Government. I make this explanation to the Senator from\r\nPennsylvania, and I think he will see the necessity of the bureau\r\ngoing into Kentucky and some of the other States, as much as into any\r\nof the Southern rebellious States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Guthrie was opposed to the extension of the bill to his State. He\r\nsaid: \"I should like to know the peculiar reasons why this bill is to\r\nbe extended to the State of Kentucky. She has never been in rebellion.\r\nThough she has been overrun by rebel armies, and her fields laid\r\nwaste, she has always had her full quota in the Union armies, and the\r\nblood of her sons has marked the fields whereon they have fought.\r\nKentucky does not want and does not ask this relief. The freedmen in\r\nKentucky are a part of our population; and where the old, and lame,\r\nand halt, and blind, and infants require care and attention they\r\nobtain it from the counties. Our whole organization for the support of\r\nthe poor, through the agencies of the magistrates in the several\r\ncounties, is complete.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon. Henry Wilson.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Mr. Creswell, of Maryland, saw a necessity for the\r\noperation of the bill in his State. He said: \"I have received, within\r\nthe last two or three weeks, letters from gentlemen of the highest\r\nrespectability in my State, asserting that combinations of returned\r\nrebel soldiers have been formed for the express purpose of\r\npersecuting, beating most cruelly, and in some cases actually\r\nmurdering the returned colored soldiers of the republic. In certain\r\nsections of my State, the civil law affords no remedy at all. It is\r\nimpossible there to enforce against these people so violating the law\r\nthe penalties which the law has prescribed for these offenses. It is,\r\ntherefore, necessary, in my opinion, that this bill shall extend over\r\nthe State of Maryland.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan, in the course of a speech on the bill, said: \"Thank God! we\r\nare now rid of slavery; that is now gone.\" He also said: \"Let the\r\nfriends of the negro, and I am one, be satisfied to treat him as he is\r\ntreated in Pennsylvania; as he is treated in Ohio; as he is treated\r\nevery-where where people have maintained their sanity upon the\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson said: \"The Senator from Pennsylvania tells us that he is\r\nthe friend of the negro. What, sir, he the friend of the negro! Why,\r\nsir, there has hardly been a proposition before the Senate of the\r\nUnited States for the last five years, looking to the emancipation of\r\nthe negro and the protection of his rights, that the Senator from\r\nPennsylvania has not sturdily opposed. He has hardly ever uttered a\r\nword upon this floor the tendency of which was not to degrade and to\r\nbelittle a weak and struggling race. He comes here to-day and thanks\r\nGod that they are free, when his vote and his voice for five years,\r\nwith hardly an exception, have been against making them free. He\r\nthanks God, sir, that your work and mine, our work which has saved a\r\ncountry and emancipated a race, is secured; while from the word 'go,'\r\nto this time, he has made himself the champion of 'how not to do it.'\r\nIf there be a man on the floor of the American Senate who has tortured\r\nthe Constitution of the country to find powers to arrest the voice of\r\nthis nation which was endeavoring to make a race free, the Senator\r\nfrom Pennsylvania is the man; and now he comes here and thanks God\r\nthat a work which he has done his best to arrest, and which we have\r\ncarried, is accomplished. I tell him to-day that we shall carry these\r\nother measures, whether he thanks God for them or not, whether he\r\nopposes them or not.\" [Laughter and applause in the galleries.]\r\n\r\nAfter an extended discussion, the Senate refused, by a vote of\r\nthirty-three against eleven, to adopt the amendment proposed by Mr.\r\nCowan.\r\n\r\nThe bill was further discussed during three successive days, Messrs.\r\nSaulsbury, Hendricks, Johnson, McDougall, and Davis speaking against\r\nthe measure, and Messrs. Fessenden, Creswell, and Trumbull in favor of\r\nit. Mr. Garrett Davis addressed the Senate more than once on the\r\nsubject, and on the last day of the discussion made a very long\r\nspeech, which was answered by Mr. Trumbull. The Senator from Illinois,\r\nat the conclusion of his speech, remarked:\r\n\r\n\"What I have now said embraces, I believe, all the points of the long\r\ngentleman's speech except the sound and fury, and that I will not\r\nundertake to reply to.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the short gentleman's long speech,\" interposed some Senator.\r\n\r\n\"Did I say short?\" asked Mr. Trumbull. \"If so, it was a great mistake\r\nto speak of any thing connected with the Senator from Kentucky as\r\nshort.\" [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n\"It is long enough to reach you,\" responded Mr. Davis.\r\n\r\nThe vote was soon after taken on the passage of the bill, with the\r\nfollowing result:\r\n\r\n     YEAS--Messrs. Anthony, Brown, Chandler, Clark, Conness,\r\n     Cragin, Creswell, Dixon, Doolittle, Fessenden, Foot, Foster,\r\n     Grimes, Harris, Henderson, Howard, Howe, Kirkwood, Lane of\r\n     Indiana, Lane of Kansas, Morgan, Morrill, Norton, Nye,\r\n     Poland, Pomeroy, Ramsey, Sherman, Sprague, Stewart, Sumner,\r\n     Trumbull, Van Winkle, Wade, Williams, Wilson, and Yates--37.\r\n\r\n     NAYS--Messrs. Buckalew, Davis, Guthrie, Hendricks, Johnson,\r\n     McDougall, Riddle, Saulsbury, Stockton, and Wright--10.\r\n\r\n     ABSENT--Messrs. Cowan, Nesmith, and Willey--3.\r\n\r\nThe bill having passed, the question came up as to its title, which it\r\nwas proposed to leave as reported by the committee: \"A bill to enlarge\r\nthe powers of the Freedmen's Bureau.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis moved to amend the title by substituting for it, \"A bill to\r\nappropriate a portion of the public land in some of the Southern\r\nStates and to authorize the United States Government to purchase lands\r\nto supply farms and build houses upon them for the freed negroes; to\r\npromote strife and conflict between the white and black races; and to\r\ninvest the Freedmen's Bureau with unconstitutional powers to aid and\r\nassist the blacks, and to introduce military power to prevent the\r\ncommissioner and other officers of said bureau from being restrained\r\nor held responsible in civil courts for their illegal acts in\r\nrendering such aid and assistance to the blacks, and for other\r\npurposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe President _pro tempore_ pronounced the amendment \"not in order,\r\ninconsistent with the character of the bill, derogatory to the Senate,\r\na reproach to its members.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McDougall declared the proposed amendment \"an insult to the action\r\nof the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate proposition was quietly abandoned by its author, and\r\npassed over without further notice by the Senate. By unanimous\r\nconsent, the title of the bill remained as first reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE FREEDMEN'S BUREAU BILL IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n     The Bill reported to the House -- Mr. Eliot's Speech --\r\n     History -- Mr. Dawson vs. the Negro -- Mr. Garfield -- The\r\n     Idol Broken -- Mr. Taylor counts the Cost -- Mr. Donnelly's\r\n     Amendment -- Mr. Kerr -- Mr. Marshall on White Slavery --\r\n     Mr. Hubbard -- Mr. Moulton -- Opposition from Kentucky --\r\n     Mr. Ritter -- Mr. Rousseau's Threat -- Mr. Shanklin's Gloomy\r\n     Prospect -- Mr. Trimble's Appeal -- Mr. Mckee an exceptional\r\n     Kentuckian -- Mr. Grinnell on Kentucky -- the Example of\r\n     Russia -- Mr. Phelps -- Mr. Shellabarger's Amendment -- Mr.\r\n     Chanler -- Mr. Stevens' Amendments -- Mr. Eliot closes the\r\n     Discussion -- Passage of the Bill -- Yeas and Nays.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day succeeding the passage of the bill in the Senate, it was\r\nsent to the House of Representatives, and by them referred to the\r\nSelect Committee on the Freedmen.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January, Mr. Eliot, Chairman of this committee,\r\nreported the bill to the House with amendments, mainly verbal\r\nalterations.\r\n\r\nIn a speech, advocating the passage of the bill, Mr. Eliot presented\r\nsomething of the history of legislation for the freedmen. He said: \"On\r\nthe 3d day of last March the bill establishing a Freedmen's Bureau\r\nbecame a law. It was novel legislation, without precedent in the\r\nhistory of any nation, rendered necessary by the rebellion of eleven\r\nslave States and the consequent liberation from slavery of four\r\nmillion persons whose unpaid labor had enriched the lands and\r\nimpoverished the hearts of their relentless masters.\r\n\r\n\"At an early day, when the fortunes of war had shown alternate\r\ntriumphs and defeats to loyal arms, and the timid feared and the\r\ndisloyal hoped, it was my grateful office to introduce the first bill\r\ncreating a bureau of emancipation. It was during the Thirty-seventh\r\nCongress. But, although the select committee to which the bill was\r\nreferred was induced to agree that it should be reported to the House,\r\nit so happened that the distinguished Chairman, Judge White, of\r\nIndiana, did not succeed in reporting it for our action. At the\r\nbeginning of the Thirty-eighth Congress it was again presented, and\r\nvery soon was reported back to the House under the title of 'A bill to\r\nestablish a Bureau of Freedmen's Affairs.' It was fully debated and\r\npassed by the House. The vote was sixty-nine in favor, and sixty-seven\r\nagainst the bill; but of the sixty-seven who opposed it, fifty-six had\r\nbeen counted against it, because of their political affinities. On the\r\n1st of March, 1864, the bill went to the Senate. It came back to the\r\nHouse on the 30th of June, four days before the adjournment of\r\nCongress. To my great regret, the Senate had passed an amendment in\r\nthe nature of a substitute, attaching this bureau to the Treasury\r\nDepartment; but it was too late to take action upon it then, and the\r\nbill was postponed until December. At that time the House\r\nnon-concurred with the Senate, and a committee of conference was\r\nchosen. The managers of the two houses could not agree as to whether\r\nthe War Department or the Treasury should manage the affairs of the\r\nbureau. They therefore agreed upon a bill creating an independent\r\ndepartment neither attached to the War nor Treasury, but communicating\r\ndirectly with the President, and resting for its support upon the arm\r\nof the War Department. That bill was also passed by the House but was\r\ndefeated in the Senate. Another Conference Committee was chosen, and\r\nthat committee, whose chairman in the House was the distinguished\r\ngentleman from Ohio, then and now at the head of the Military\r\nCommittee, agreed upon a bill attaching the bureau to the War\r\nDepartment, and embracing refugees as well as freedmen in its terms.\r\nThat bill is now the law.\r\n\r\n\"The law was approved on the 3d of March, 1865. Nine months have not\r\nyet elapsed since its organization. The order from the War Department\r\nunder which the bureau was organized bears date on the 12th of May,\r\n1865. General Howard, who was then in command of the Department of\r\nTennessee, was assigned as commissioner of the bureau. The bill became\r\na law so late in the session that it was impossible for Congress to\r\nlegislate any appropriation for its support. It was necessary,\r\ntherefore, that the management of it should be placed in the hands of\r\nmilitary officers, and fortunately the provisions of the bill\r\npermitted that to be done. General Howard was, as I stated, in command\r\nof the Department of Tennessee, when he was detailed to this duty. But\r\non the 15th of May, that is to say, within three days after the order\r\nappointing him, was issued, he assumed the duties of his office.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of a few days, the commissioner of the bureau announced\r\nmore particularly the policy which he designed to pursue. The whole\r\nsupervision of the care of freedmen and of all lands which the law\r\nplaced under the charge of the bureau was to be intrusted to assistant\r\ncommissioners.\r\n\r\n\"Before a month had expired, head-quarters had been established for\r\nassistant commissioners at Richmond, Raleigh, Beaufort, Montgomery,\r\nNashville, St. Louis, Vicksburg, New Orleans, and Jacksonville, and\r\nvery shortly afterward assistant commissioners were designated for\r\nthose posts of duty. They were required to possess themselves, as soon\r\nas practicable, with the duties incident to their offices, to quicken\r\nin every way they could and to direct the industry of the freedmen.\r\nNotice was given that the relief establishments which had been created\r\nby law under the operations of the War Department should be\r\ndiscontinued as soon as they could be consistently with the comfort\r\nand proper protection of the freedmen, and that every effort should be\r\nmade--and I call the attention of gentlemen to the fact that that\r\npolicy has been pursued throughout--that every effort should be made\r\nto render the freedmen, at an early day, self-supporting. The supplies\r\nthat had been furnished by the Government were only to be continued so\r\nlong as the actual wants of the freedmen seemed to require it. At that\r\ntime there were all over the country refugees who were seeking their\r\nhomes, and they were notified that, under the care of the bureau, they\r\nwould be protected from abuse, and directed in their efforts to secure\r\ntransportation and proper facilities for reaching home.\r\n\r\n\"Wherever there had been interruption of civil law, it was found\r\nimpossible that the rights of freedmen could be asserted in the\r\ncourts; and where there were no courts before which their rights could\r\nbe brought for adjudication, military tribunals, provost-marshals'\r\ncourts, were established, for the purpose of determining upon\r\nquestions arising between freedmen or between freedmen and other\r\nparties; and that, also, has been continued to this day.\r\n\r\n\"The commissioners were instructed to permit the freedmen to select\r\ntheir own employers and to choose their own kind of service. All\r\nagreements were ordered to be free and mutual, and not to be\r\ncompulsory. The old system that had prevailed of overseer labor was\r\nordered to be repudiated by the commissioners who had charge of the\r\nlaborers, and I believe there has been no time since the organization\r\nof the bureau when there have not been reports made to head-quarters\r\nat Washington of all labor contracts; and wherever any provisions had\r\nbeen inserted, by inadvertence or otherwise, that seemed unjustly to\r\noperate against the freedmen, they have been stricken out by direction\r\nof the commissioner here.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of the next month, action was taken by the commissioner\r\nrespecting a provision of the law as it was passed in March,\r\nauthorizing the Secretary of War to make issues of clothing and\r\nprovisions, and the assistant commissioners were required carefully to\r\nascertain whatever might be needed under that provision of the law,\r\nand to make periodical reports as to the demands made upon the\r\nGovernment through the bureau. Directions were given by the\r\ncommissioner to his assistant commissioners to make repeated reports\r\nto him upon all the various subjects which had come under his\r\ncharge--with regard to the number of freedmen, where they were,\r\nwhether in camps or in colonies, or whether they were employed upon\r\nGovernment works, and stating, if they obtained supplies, how they\r\nwere furnished, whether by donations or whether procured by purchase.\r\nReports were also required as to all lands which had been put under\r\nthe care of the bureau; and statements were called for showing\r\ndescriptions of the lands, whether, in the language of the law,\r\n'abandoned' or 'confiscated,' so that the bureau here could have full\r\nand complete information of all action of its agents throughout these\r\nStates, and upon examination it could be determined where any specific\r\nlands which were under the charge of the bureau came from, and how\r\nthey were derived.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of the summer, it became necessary to issue additional\r\ninstructions. The commissioner found that his way was beset with\r\ndifficulties; he was walking upon unknown ground; he was testing here\r\nand there questions involved in doubt. It was hardly possible at once\r\nand by one order to designate all that it would be needful for him to\r\ndo, and, therefore, different instructions were issued from time to\r\ntime from his office. The assistant commissioners were called upon\r\nthoroughly to examine, either by themselves or their agents, the\r\nrespective districts allotted to them, to make inquiry as to the\r\ncharacter of the freedmen under their charge, their ability to labor,\r\ntheir disposition to labor, and the circumstances under which they\r\nwere placed, so that the aid, the care, and the protection which the\r\nlaw contemplated might be afforded to them as quickly and as\r\neconomically as possible.\r\n\r\n\"The commissioner continually repeated his injunctions to his\r\nassistants to be sure that no compulsory or unpaid labor was\r\ntolerated, and that both the moral and intellectual condition of the\r\nfreedmen should be improved as systematically and as quickly as\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\n\"When the bureau was first organized, indeed when it was first urged\r\nupon the attention of this House, it was stated and it was believed\r\nthat the bureau would very shortly be self-sustaining. That was the\r\nidea from the beginning. And when it was stated here in debate that\r\nthe bureau would probably be self-sustaining, it was supposed that\r\nfrom the lands abandoned, confiscated, sold, and the lands of the\r\nUnited States, which by the provisions of the bill had been placed\r\nunder the care of the commissioner, these freedmen would be given an\r\nopportunity to earn substantially enough for the conduct of the\r\nbureau. And I have no doubt at all that such would have been the case\r\nhad the original expectation been carried out.\r\n\r\n\"There were large tracts of land in Virginia and the other rebel\r\nStates which were clearly applicable to this purpose. There was the\r\nsource of supply--the lands and the labor. There were laborers enough,\r\nand there was rich land enough. At a very early day the abandoned\r\nlands were turned over to the care of the commissioners, and I\r\nsupposed, and probably we all supposed, that the lands which in the\r\nlanguage of the law were known as 'abandoned lands,' and those which\r\nwere in the possession of the United States, would be appropriated to\r\nthe uses of these freedmen. Within a week after the commissioner\r\nassumed the duties of his office, he found it necessary to issue an\r\norder substantially like this: Whereas, large amounts of lands in the\r\nState of Virginia and in other States have been abandoned, and are now\r\nin the possession of the freedmen, and are now under cultivation by\r\nthem; and, whereas, the owners of those lands are now calling for\r\ntheir restoration, so as to deprive the freedmen of the results of\r\ntheir industry, it is ordered that the abandoned lands now under\r\ncultivation be retained by the freedmen until the growing crops can be\r\nsecured, unless full and just compensation can be made them for their\r\nlabor and its products.\r\n\r\n\"'The above order'--this is the part about which it appeared that some\r\ndifference of judgment existed between the Executive and the\r\ncommissioner of the bureau--'the above order will not be construed so\r\nas to relieve disloyal persons from the consequences of their\r\ndisloyalty; and the application for the restoration of their lands by\r\nthis class of persons will in no case be entertained by any military\r\nauthority.'\r\n\r\n\"It was found, not a great while afterward, that the views which the\r\nPresident entertained as to his duty were somewhat in conflict with\r\nthe provisions of this order; for it was held by the President that\r\npersons who had brought themselves within the range of his pardon and\r\nhad secured it, and who had taken or did afterward take the amnesty\r\noath, would be entitled, as one of the results of the pardon and of\r\ntheir position after the oath had been taken, to a restoration of\r\ntheir lands which had been assigned to freedmen. In consequence of\r\nthis, an order was subsequently issued, well known as circular No. 15.\r\nAnd under the operation of that circular, on its appearing\r\nsatisfactorily to any assistant commissioner that any property under\r\nhis control is not 'abandoned,' as defined in the law, and that the\r\nUnited States have acquired no perfect right to it, it is to be\r\nrestored and the fact reported to the commissioner. 'Abandoned' lands\r\nwere to be restored to the owners pardoned by the President, by the\r\nassistant commissioners, to whom applications for such restoration\r\nwere to be forwarded; and each application was to be accompanied by\r\nthe pardon of the President and by a copy of the oath of amnesty\r\nprescribed in the President's proclamation, and also by a proof of\r\ntitle to the land. It must be obvious that the effect of this must\r\nhave been to transfer from the care of the bureau to the owners very\r\nlarge portions of the land which had been relied upon for the support\r\nof the freedmen. Within a few weeks from the date of that order, no\r\nless than $800,000 worth of property in New Orleans was transferred,\r\nand about one third of the whole property in North Carolina in\r\npossession of the bureau was given up; and the officer having charge\r\nof the land department reports that before the end of the year, in all\r\nprobability, there will be under the charge of the commissioner\r\nlittle, if any, of the lands originally designed for the support of\r\nthese freedmen.\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious, if these lands are to be taken, that other lands must\r\nbe provided, or the freedmen will become a dead weight upon the\r\nTreasury, and the bill under consideration assigns other lands, in the\r\nplace of those thus taken, from the unoccupied public lands of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Mr. Dawson, of Pennsylvania, obtained the floor\r\nin opposition to the bill. His speech was not devoted to a discussion\r\nof the bill in question, but was occupied entirely with general\r\npolitical and social topics. The following extract indicates the tenor\r\nof the speech:\r\n\r\n\"Negro equality does not exist in nature. The African is without a\r\nhistory. He has never shown himself capable of self-government by the\r\ncreation of a single independent State possessing the attributes which\r\nchallenge the respect of others. The past is silent of any negro\r\npeople who possessed military and civil organization, who cultivated\r\nthe arts at home, or conducted a regular commerce with their\r\nneighbors. No African general has marched south of the desert, from\r\nthe waters of the Nile to the Niger and Senegal, to unite by conquest\r\nthe scattered territories of barbarous tribes into one great and\r\nhomogeneous kingdom. No Moses, Solon, Lycurgus, or Alfred has left\r\nthem a code of wise and salutary laws. They have had no builder of\r\ncities; they have no representatives in the arts, in science, or in\r\nliterature; they have been without even a monument, an alphabet, or a\r\nhieroglyphic.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Mr. Garfield, of Ohio, among the friends of the\r\nmeasure, delivered a speech \"on the Freedmen's Bureau Bill,\" in which\r\nthe topic discussed was \"Restoration of the Rebel States.\" In the\r\ncourse of his remarks Mr. Garfield said:\r\n\r\n\"Let the stars of heaven illustrate our constellation of States. When\r\nGod launched the planets upon their celestial pathway, he bound them\r\nall by the resistless power of attraction to the central sun, around\r\nwhich they revolved in their appointed orbits. Each may be swept by\r\nstorms, may be riven by lightnings, may be rocked by earthquakes, may\r\nbe devastated by all the terrestrial forces and overwhelmed in ruin,\r\nbut far away in the everlasting depths, the sovereign sun holds the\r\nturbulent planet in its place. This earth may be overwhelmed until the\r\nhigh hills are covered by the sea; it may tremble with earthquakes\r\nmiles below the soil, but it must still revolve in its appointed\r\norbit. So Alabama may overwhelm all her municipal institutions in\r\nruin, but she can not annul the omnipotent decrees of the sovereign\r\npeople of the Union. She must be held forever in her orbit of\r\nobedience and duty.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having quoted Gibbon's narrative of the destruction of the\r\ncolossal statue of Serapis by Theophilus, Mr. Garfield said: \"So\r\nslavery sat in our national Capitol. Its huge bulk filled the temple\r\nof our liberty, touching it from side to side. Mr. Lincoln, on the 1st\r\nof January, 1863, struck it on the cheek, and the faithless and\r\nunbelieving among us expected to see the fabric of our institutions\r\ndissolve into chaos because their idol had fallen. He struck it again;\r\nCongress and the States repeated the blow, and its unsightly carcass\r\nlies rotting in our streets. The sun shines in the heavens brighter\r\nthan before. Let us remove the carcass and leave not a vestige of the\r\nmonster. We shall never have done that until we have dared to come up\r\nto the spirit of the Pilgrim covenant of 1620, and declare that all\r\nmen shall be consulted in regard to the disposition of their lives,\r\nliberty, and property. The Pilgrim fathers proceeded on the doctrine\r\nthat every man was supposed to know best what he wanted, and had the\r\nright to a voice in the disposition of himself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor, of New York, opposed the bill principally on the ground of\r\nthe expense involved in its execution. After having presented many\r\ncolumns of figures, Mr. Taylor arrived at this conclusion: \"The cost\r\nor proximate cost of the bureau for one year, confining its operation\r\nto the hitherto slave States, will be $25,251,600. That it is intended\r\nto put the bureau in full operation in every county and parish of the\r\nhitherto slave States, including Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and\r\nMissouri, I have not the least doubt, nor have I any doubt but that it\r\nis intended to extend it into parts of some of the border States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Donnelly moved to amend the bill by inserting the provision that\r\n\"the commissioner may provide a common-school education for all\r\nrefugees and freedmen who shall apply therefor.\" He advocated\r\neducation as an efficient means of restoration for the South. He\r\npresented ample tables of statistics, and summed up the results in\r\ntheir bearing upon his argument as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The whole United States, with a population of 27,000,000, contains\r\n834,106 illiterate persons, and of these 545,177 are found in the\r\nSouthern States with a population of 12,000,000. In other words, the\r\nentire populous North contains but 288,923, while the sparsely-settled\r\nSouth contains 545,177.\"\r\n\r\nAs an argument for the passage of the bill, he answered the question,\r\n\"What has the South done for the black man since the close of the\r\nrebellion?\"\r\n\r\n\"In South Carolina it is provided that all male negroes between two\r\nand twenty, and all females between two and eighteen, shall be bound\r\nout to some 'master.' The adult negro is compelled to enter into\r\ncontract with a master, and the district judge, not the laborer, is to\r\nfix the value of the labor. If he thinks the compensation too small\r\nand will not work, he is a vagrant, and can be hired out for a term of\r\nservice at a rate again to be fixed by the judge. If a hired negro\r\nleaves his employer he forfeits his wages for the whole year.\r\n\r\n\"The black code of Mississippi provides that no negro shall own or\r\nhire lands in the State; that he shall not sue nor testify in court\r\nagainst a white man; that he must be employed by a master before the\r\nsecond Monday in January, or he will be bound out--in other words,\r\nsold into slavery; that if he runs away the master may recover him,\r\nand deduct the expenses out of his wages; and that if another man\r\nemploys him he will be liable to an action for damages. It is true,\r\nthe President has directed General Thomas to disregard this code; but\r\nthe moment the military force is withdrawn from the State that order\r\nwill be of no effect.\r\n\r\n\"The black code of Alabama provides that if a negro who has contracted\r\nto labor fails to do so, he shall be punished with damages; and if he\r\nruns away he shall be punished as a vagrant, which probably means that\r\nhe shall be sold to the highest bidder for a term of years; and that\r\nany person who entices him to leave his master, as by the offer of\r\nbetter wages, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and may be sent to\r\njail for six months; and further, that these regulations include all\r\npersons of negro blood to the third generation, though one parent in\r\neach generation shall be pure white; that is, down to the man who has\r\nbut one eighth negro blood in his veins.\"\r\n\r\nAfter quoting the black codes of other States, the speaker thus\r\nepitomized their substance: \"All this means simply the reëstablishment\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\n\"1. He shall work at a rate of wages to be fixed by a county judge or\r\na Legislature made up of white masters, or by combinations of white\r\nmasters, and not in any case by himself.\r\n\r\n\"2. He shall not leave that master to enter service with another. If\r\nhe does he is pursued as a fugitive, charged with the expenses of his\r\nrecapture, and made to labor for an additional period, while the white\r\nman who induced him to leave is sent to jail.\r\n\r\n\"3. His children are taken from him and sold into virtual slavery.\r\n\r\n\"4. If he refuses to work, he is sold to the highest bidder for a term\r\nof months or years, and becomes, in fact, a slave.\r\n\r\n\"5. He can not better his condition; there is no future for him; he\r\nshall not own property; he shall not superintend the education of his\r\nchildren; neither will the State educate them.\r\n\r\n\"6. If he is wronged, he has no remedy; for the courts are closed\r\nagainst him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kerr, of Indiana, addressed the House on the subject of\r\nreconstruction, maintaining, by extended arguments and quotations from\r\nlearned authorities, that the rebel States were still in the Union. He\r\nconcluded his speech by opposing the bill under consideration on the\r\nground of its expense: \"It involves the creation of a small army of\r\nagents and commissioners, whose jurisdiction and control shall pervade\r\nthe whole country, shall extend into every State, into every\r\ncongressional district, into every county, into every township and\r\ncity of this broad Union; provided, only, that they can find some\r\nfreedmen or refugees upon whom to exercise their jurisdiction. I\r\nsubmit that, before a measure of this kind should be adopted, we\r\nshould reflect most carefully upon what we are doing. We should\r\nremember that this country is now almost crushed into the very earth\r\nwith its accumulated burden of public debt, of State debts, of county\r\ndebts, of city debts, of township debts, of individual debts. We\r\nshould bear in mind that we may impose upon the people of this\r\ncountry, by this kind of latitudinarian and most dangerous\r\nlegislation, a burden that is too heavy to be borne, and against which\r\nthe day may come when the people, as one man, will feel themselves\r\ncalled upon to protest in such a manner as forever to overthrow that\r\nkind of legislation, and condemn to merited reproach those who favor\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent day of the discussion, Mr. Marshall, of Illinois,\r\nspoke against the bill. He put much stress upon an objection to which\r\nnearly all the opponents of the bill had referred, namely, that\r\nCongress had no warrant in the Constitution for passing such a\r\nmeasure. He said: \"Instead of this being called a bill for the\r\nprotection of freedmen and refugees, it ought to be called a bill for\r\nthe purpose of destroying the Constitution of the United States, and\r\nsubjecting the people thereof to military power and domination. That\r\nwould be a much more appropriate title.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall was opposed to bestowing any thing in charity. \"I deny,\"\r\nsaid he, \"that this Federal Government has any authority to become the\r\ncommon almoner of the charities of the people. I deny that there is\r\nany authority in the Federal Constitution to authorize us to put our\r\nhands into their pockets and take therefrom a part of their hard\r\nearnings in order to distribute them as charity. I deny that the\r\nFederal Government was established for any such purpose, or that there\r\nis any authority or warrant in the Constitution for the measures which\r\nare proposed in this most extraordinary bill.\"\r\n\r\nHe viewed with horror the slavery which the head of the War Department\r\ncould impose upon the people by virtue of the provisions of this bill.\r\n\"He is to send his military satraps,\" said Mr. Marshall, \"into every\r\ncounty and district of these States; and they may enslave and put down\r\nthe entire white people of the country by virtue of this law.\" He saw\r\nin the bill power \"to rob the people by unjust taxation; to take the\r\nhard earnings from the white people of the West, who, unless wiser\r\ncounsels prevail, will themselves soon be reduced to worse than\r\nEgyptian bondage. I demand to be informed here upon this floor by what\r\npower you put your hands into their pockets and drag from them their\r\nmoney to carry out the purposes of this measure.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hubbard, of Connecticut, made a short speech in reply to the\r\nspeaker last quoted. He said: \"The gentleman from Illinois, some\r\ntwenty times in the course of his eloquent speech this morning, called\r\nupon some one to tell him where Congress gets the power to enact such\r\na law as this. In the first place, I commend to him to read the second\r\nsection of the article of the immortal amendment of the Constitution,\r\ngiving to Congress power to pass all appropriate laws and make all\r\nappropriate legislation for the purpose of carrying out its\r\nprovisions. I commend to his careful study the spirit of the second\r\nsection of that immortal amendment, and I think, if he will study it\r\nwith a willingness to be convinced, he will see that it has given to\r\nthis Congress full power in the premises. Moreover, sir, I read in the\r\nConstitution that Congress has been at all times charged with the duty\r\nof providing for the public welfare; and if Congress shall deem that\r\nthe public welfare requires this enactment, it is the sworn duty of\r\nevery member to give the bill his support.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, there is an old maxim of law in which I have very considerable\r\nfaith, that regard must be had to the public welfare; and this maxim\r\nis said to be the highest law. It is the law of the Constitution, and\r\nin the light of that Constitution as amended I find ample power for\r\nthe enactment of this law. It is the duty of Congress to exercise its\r\npower in such a time as this, in a time of public peril; and I hope\r\nthat nobody on this side of the House will be so craven as to want\r\ncourage to come up to the question and give his vote for the bill. It\r\nis necessary to provide for the public welfare.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Moulton, of Illinois, spoke in favor of the bill. Of the\r\noft-repeated objection that \"this bill is in violation of the\r\nConstitution of the United States,\" he said: \"This is the very\r\nargument that we have heard from the other side of this chamber for\r\nthe last five years with reference to every single measure that has\r\nbeen proposed to this House for the prosecution of the war for the\r\nUnion. No measure has been passed for the benefit of the country, for\r\nthe prosecution of this war, for the defense of your rights and mine,\r\nbut has been assailed by gentlemen on the opposite side of this House\r\nwith the argument that the whole thing was unconstitutional.\"\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to set forth at length the authority of Congress to\r\npass such a bill.\r\n\r\nVery strenuous opposition to the passage of the bill was made by most\r\nof the members from Kentucky. Mr. Ritter, of that State, uttered his\r\nearnest protest at considerable length against the measure. He\r\npresented his views of the \"grand purposes and designs of those who\r\nintroduced this bill.\" In his opinion they intended \"to commence a\r\ncolony in each one of the five States above named, which is ultimately\r\nto drive out the entire white population of those States and fill\r\ntheir places with the negro race.\" And whether this is the design or\r\nnot, it is certain, in my judgment, to have this effect. And they\r\ncould not have devised a more effectual scheme for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it is not to be expected that the two races will live\r\ncontentedly where there are large numbers of the colored people living\r\nnear to neighborhoods settled with white persons. Experience has\r\nproved to many of us that wherever large numbers of colored people\r\nlive, that the white people living within five or ten miles of the\r\nplace become sufferers to a very large extent. Now, sir, if this\r\nshould be the case (as I have no doubt it will) in the States in which\r\nyou propose to establish these people, the whites and blacks will\r\ndisagree to such an extent that, when people find that the colored\r\npeople are permanently established, they will be compelled, in self\r\ndefense, to seek a home somewhere else. No doubt, Mr. Speaker, but\r\nthat those who prepared this bill saw that the difficulties and\r\ndisagreements to which I have just alluded would arise, and hence they\r\nrequire that military jurisdiction and protection shall be extended,\r\nso as to give safety in their movements; and if the white inhabitants\r\nbecome dissatisfied, the commissioner is prepared with authority by\r\nthis bill to buy them out and put the negroes upon the land.\"\r\n\r\nHe thus presented his calculation of the cost of carrying out the bill\r\nas an argument against it: \"In 1822 the ordinary expenses of the\r\nGovernment were $9,827,643, and in 1823 the expenses amounted to the\r\nsum of $9,784,154. Now, sir, who could have thought at that day that\r\nin the comparatively short time of forty-three years it would require\r\nthe sum of even $12,000,000 to fix up a machinery alone for the\r\nbenefit of three or four million negroes, and more especially, sir,\r\nwhen it is understood that in 1820 we had a population, including\r\nwhite and colored, of 9,633,545. Mr. Speaker, how long will it be at\r\nthis rate--when we take into consideration the fact that our\r\nGovernment proper, besides this little bureau machine, is now costing\r\nus hundreds of millions of dollars--how long, sir, will it be before\r\nwe have to call in the services of Mr. Kennedy, of census notoriety,\r\nto estimate the amount of the debt we owe?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rousseau, of Kentucky, in defining his position, said: \"I am not a\r\nRepublican; I was a Whig and a Union man, and belong to the Union\r\nparty, and I am sorry to say that the Union party and the Republican\r\nparty are not always convertible terms.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rousseau urged, against the Freedmen's Bureau Bill the wrongs and\r\noppressions which its abuses heaped upon the people of the South. In\r\nthe course of his speech Mr. Rousseau quoted what he had said on one\r\noccasion to an official of the Freedmen's Bureau: \"I said to him, 'if\r\nyou intend to arrest white people on the _ex parte_ statements of\r\nnegroes, and hold them to suit your convenience for trial, and fine\r\nand imprison them, then I say that I oppose you; and if you should so\r\narrest and punish me, I would kill you when you set me at liberty; and\r\nI think that you would do the same to a man who would treat you in\r\nthat way, if you are the man I think you are, and the man you ought to\r\nbe to fill your position here.'\"\r\n\r\nThis extract has considerable importance as being the occasion of an\r\nunfortunate personal difficulty between Mr. Rousseau and Mr. Grinnell,\r\nof Iowa, narrated in a subsequent chapter. The latter portion of Mr.\r\nRousseau's speech was devoted to the subject of reconstruction. He was\r\nfollowed by Mr. Shanklin, of Kentucky. He characterized the Freedmen's\r\nBureau as a \"gigantic monster.\" He declared that \"the effect of this\r\nmeasure upon the negro population will be to paralyze their energy,\r\ndestroy their industry, and make them paupers and vagabonds.\" He saw\r\n\"revolution and ruin\" in prospect. \"I affirm,\" said he, \"that in\r\nlegislating for those States, or without allowing them any\r\nrepresentation in these halls, you are violating one of the cardinal\r\nprinciples of republican government; you are tearing down the main\r\npillar upon which our whole fabric of Government rests; you are sowing\r\nbroadcast the seeds of revolution and ruin. Mr. Speaker, if the object\r\nof gentlemen here is to restore harmony and peace and prosperity\r\nthroughout the Union, why do they adopt measures thus insulting,\r\ntyrannical, and oppressive in their character? Is this the way to\r\nrestore harmony and peace and prosperity? How can you expect to gain\r\nthe respect and affection of those people by heaping upon them insult\r\nand injustice? If they have the spirit of their ancestors, you may\r\ncrush them, you may slay them, but you can never cause them to love\r\nyou or respect you; and they ought not while you force upon them\r\nmeasures which are only intended to degrade them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trimble, of Kentucky, viewed the question in a similar light to\r\nthat in which it was regarded by his colleague. \"I hold,\" said he,\r\n\"this bill is in open and plain violation of that provision of the\r\nConstitution. There exists no power in this Government to deprive a\r\ncitizen of the United States of his property, to take away the hard\r\nearnings of his own industry and bestow them upon this class of\r\ncitizens. The only way you can take property in South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, or any other State, is to take that property under the\r\nConstitution of the United States and the laws passed in pursuance\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nHe closed his speech with the following appeal: \"I appeal to my\r\nfriends who love this Union, who love it for all the memories of the\r\npast, who love it because it has protected them and theirs; I appeal\r\nto them to pause and reflect before they press this measure upon these\r\npeople; for I tell you that, in my judgment, the effects of the\r\nprovisions of this bill to us as a nation will not be told in our\r\nlifetimes. If legislation of this character is to be pressed here, I\r\nawfully fear hope will sink within us. Our love for this Union and\r\ndesire for its restoration will be greatly weakened and estranged.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKee alone, of all the Representatives from Kentucky, was\r\nfavorable to the bill. The opponents of the measure had spoken of it\r\nas a \"monstrous usurpation.\" \"We have heard that talk,\" said Mr.\r\nMcKee, \"for more than four years here. What bill has been introduced\r\ninto and passed by Congress since this war began that this same party\r\nhas not been accustomed to denounce as a monstrous usurpation of\r\npower? When the President of the United States issued his call for\r\ntroops they cried out, 'A monstrous usurpation of power.' When he sent\r\na requisition to the Governor of my own State, what was the response?\r\n'Not a man, not a dollar, to prosecute this wicked war against our\r\nSouthern brethren.' And the Union party, God help them! in Kentucky,\r\nindorsed the sentiment at that day. I did not belong to that part of\r\nthe Union party; I never belonged to that 'neutrality concern.' I\r\nnever put in my oar to help propel that ship which was in favor of\r\nthundering forth with its cannon against the North and the South\r\nalike. I never belonged to that party which said, 'We will stand as a\r\nwall of fire against either side.' I thank God I never stood upon but\r\none side, and that was the side of my country, against treason,\r\nagainst oppression, against wrong in all its forms.\"\r\n\r\nIn arguing the necessity for some such legislation as that provided in\r\nthis bill, Mr. McKee asked, \"Has any Southern State given the freedmen\r\n'their full rights and full protection?' Is there a solitary State of\r\nthose that have been in rebellion, (and I include my own State with\r\nthe rest, because, although she has never been, by proclamation,\r\ndeclared a State in rebellion, I think she has been one of the most\r\nrebellious of the whole crew,) is there a single one of these States\r\nthat has passed laws to give the freedmen full protection? In vain we\r\nwait an affirmative response. Until these States have done so, says\r\nthis high authority, the Freedmen's Bureau is a necessity. This is to\r\nmy mind a sufficient answer to the arguments of gentlemen on the other\r\nside. In none of those States has the black man a law to protect him\r\nin his rights, either of person or property. He can sue in a court of\r\njustice in my State, but he can command no testimony in his\r\nprosecution or defense unless the witness be a white man. We have one\r\ncode for the white man, another for the black. Is this justice? Where\r\nis your court of justice in any Southern State where the black man can\r\nsecure protection? Again there is no response.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Grinnell, of Iowa, a member of the committee that had reported\r\nthis bill, took the floor in its favor. Much having been said by\r\nRepresentatives of Kentucky in reference to that State, Mr. Grinnell\r\nremarked: \"I can not forget, when I hear these extravagant claims set\r\nup here, that her Governor, in the first year of the rebellion,\r\nrefused to honor the call for troops made by the President of the\r\nUnited States in our darkest hour; nor can I forget that when her\r\nsoldiers wished to organize regiments they were obliged to cross the\r\nOhio River into the State of Indiana, that they might organize them\r\nfree from the interference of the power of Kentucky neutrality. That\r\nis a fact in history, and I can not overlook it, when gentlemen here\r\narraign the President of the United States because he has seen fit to\r\nsuspend the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ in the State of\r\nKentucky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see,\" said Mr. Grinnell, in a subsequent part of his speech,\r\n\"what are the laws of Kentucky which are so just and honorable and\r\nequitable. The white man in Kentucky can testify in the courts; the\r\nblack man can testify against himself. The white man can vote; the\r\nblack man can not. The white man, if he commits an offense, is tried\r\nby a jury of his peers; the black man is tried by his enlightened,\r\nunprejudiced superiors. The rape of a negro woman by a white man is no\r\noffense; the rape of a white woman by a negro man is punishable by\r\ndeath, and the Governor of the State can not commute.\r\n\r\n\"A white man may come into Kentucky when he pleases; the free negro\r\nwho comes there is a felon, though a discharged soldier, and wounded\r\nin our battles. A white man in Kentucky may keep a gun; if a black man\r\nbuys a gun he forfeits it, and pays a fine of five dollars if\r\npresuming to keep in his possession a musket which he has carried\r\nthrough the war. Arson of public buildings, if committed by a white\r\nman, is punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term of\r\nfrom seven to twenty-one years; if committed by a black man, the\r\npunishment is death. Arson of a warehouse, etc., when committed by a\r\nwhite man, is punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary from one to\r\nsix years; when committed by a negro, the penalty is death.\r\n\r\n\"If a white man is guilty of insurrection or rebellion, he is punished\r\nby being called 'chivalrous.' I instance the rebel General Forest, who\r\nmurdered white men at Fort Pillow, and is reputed the most popular man\r\nSouth. If a negro rebels, or conspires to rebel, he is punished with\r\ndeath. These are specimens.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the benefits conferred by the Freedmen's Bureau upon\r\nKentucky, Mr. Grinnell remarked: \"As it is asserted that this\r\nFreedmen's Bureau is a partial, unnecessary, speculating affair, I\r\nwish to call attention to the fact that in the State of Kentucky,\r\nduring the last five months, more white refugees than freedmen, in the\r\nproportion of seven and one-fourth to one, have received rations at\r\nthe hands of the Government; that this bureau has kept in schools in\r\nthe State of Kentucky fourteen thousand black people.\"\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of the work accomplished by this\r\ninstrumentality, he said: \"This bureau is in charge of 800,000 acres\r\nof land and 1,500 pieces of town property. It has issued more than\r\n600,000 rations to refugees, and 3,500,000 to freedmen. It has treated\r\n2,500 refugees in hospitals, and decently buried 227 of them. It has\r\ntreated 45,000 freedmen, and made the graves for 6,000 of the number.\r\nTransportation has been furnished to 1,700 refugees and 1,900\r\nfreedmen. In the schools there are 80,000 people that have been\r\ninstructed by this bureau. And now it is proposed to leave all these\r\nchildren of misfortune to the tender mercies of a people of whom it is\r\ntrue by the Spanish maxim, 'Since I have wronged you I have hated\r\nyou.' I never can. Our authority to take care of them is founded in\r\nthe Constitution; else it is not worthy to be our great charter. It\r\ngives authority to feed Indian tribes, though our enemies, and a just\r\ninterpretation can not restrain us in clothing and feeding unfortunate\r\nfriends. In providing schools, we can turn to the same authority which\r\nled to the gift of millions of acres of the public domain for the\r\npurpose of establishing agricultural colleges in this country.\"\r\n\r\nHe referred to Russia for example of what should be done in such an\r\nemergency: \"We should be worse than barbarians to leave these people\r\nwhere they are, landless, poor, unprotected; and I commend to\r\ngentlemen who still cling to the delusion that all is well, to take\r\nlessons of the Czar of the Russias, who, when he enfranchised his\r\npeople, gave them lands and school-houses, and invited school-masters\r\nfrom all the world to come there and instruct them. Let us hush our\r\nnational songs; rather gird on sack-cloth, if wanting in moral courage\r\nto reap the fruits of our war by being just and considerate to those\r\nwho look up to us for temporary counsel and protection. Care and\r\neducation are cheaper for the nation than neglect, and nothing is\r\nplainer in the counsels of heaven or the world's history.\"\r\n\r\nAn allusion made by Mr. Grinnell to the speech of Mr. Rosseau,\r\nprovoked the personal assault to be described hereafter.\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond having the floor for a personal explanation, took occasion\r\nto make the following remarks in reference to the bill: \"I have no\r\napprehensions as to the practical workings of this law. So far as I\r\nhave been able to collect information from all quarters--and I have\r\ntaken some pains to do so--I find that this law, like most other laws\r\non our statute books, works well where it is well administered. The\r\npractical operations of this bureau will depend upon the character of\r\nthe agents into whose hands its management is intrusted. I certainly\r\nhave no apprehension in this respect. I do not for one moment fear\r\nthat the agents who will be appointed to carry this law into execution\r\nwill not use the powers conferred upon them for the furtherance of the\r\ngreat object which we all have in view--the reconciliation, the\r\nprotection, the security of all classes of those who are now our\r\nfellow-citizens in the Southern States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Phelps, of Maryland, made a speech indorsing the principle of the\r\nbill, but objecting to some of its details. His objections were\r\nremoved by the presentation and acceptance of the following amendment\r\nby Mr. Shellabarger, of Ohio: \"No person shall be deemed destitute,\r\nsuffering, or dependent upon the Government for support, within the\r\nmeaning of this act, who, being able to find employment, could, by\r\nproper industry and exertion, avoid such destitution, suffering and\r\ndependence.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chanler made a long speech in opposition to the bill. He gave\r\nparticular attention to the speech of Mr. Donnelly, of Minnesota, who\r\nhad advocated education as a necessity for the South. \"The malignant\r\nparty spirit and sectional hate,\" said Mr. Chanler, \"that runs through\r\nthis whole statement, needs no illustration.\" After presenting\r\nvoluminous extracts from speeches, letters, and public documents, Mr.\r\nChanler summed up his objections to the bill in the following words:\r\n\"Our people are not willing to live under military rule.\r\n\r\n\"This bureau is under military rule. It proposes to perpetuate and\r\nstrengthen itself by the present bill.\r\n\r\n\"It founds an '_imperium in imperio_' to protect black labor against\r\nwhite labor.\r\n\r\n\"It excludes the foreign immigrant from the lands given to the\r\nnative-born negro.\r\n\r\n\"It subjects the white native-born citizen to the ignominy of\r\nsurrendering his patrimony, his self-respect, and his right to labor\r\ninto the hands of negroes, idle, ignorant, and misled by fanatic,\r\nselfish speculators.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens desired to amend the bill by striking out the limitation\r\nto three years given the possessory titles conferred by General\r\nSherman, and rendering them perpetual. This amendment the House were\r\nunwilling to accept. Mr. Stevens further proposed to strike out the\r\nproviso \"unless as punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have\r\nbeen duly convicted,\" giving as a reason for this amendment, \"I know\r\nthat men are convicted of assault and battery, and sentenced to\r\nslavery down there. I have authentic evidence of that fact in several\r\nletters, and, therefore, I propose to strike out those words.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment was adopted. Another important amendment proposed by\r\nthe committee was the limitation of the operation of the bill to\r\nStates in which the writ of _habeas corpus_ was suspended on the 1st\r\nof February, 1866. Mr. Eliot closed the debate by answering some\r\nobjections to the bill, and presenting some official documents proving\r\nthe beneficent results of the bureau, especially in the State of\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of February the question was taken, and the bill passed by\r\nthe following vote:\r\n\r\n     YEAS--Messrs.

Mr. Trumbull said: \"The House of Representatives have\r\nadopted a substitute for the whole bill, but it is the Senate bill\r\n_verbatim_, with a few exceptions, which I will endeavor to point out.\r\nThe title of the bill has been changed, to begin with. It was called\r\nas it passed the Senate 'A bill to enlarge the powers of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau.' The House has amended the title so as to make it\r\nread, 'A bill to amend an act entitled \"An act to establish a Bureau\r\nfor the Relief of Freedmen and Refugees,\" and for other purposes.' Of\r\ncourse, there is no importance in that.\r\n\r\n\"The first amendment which the House has made, and the most important\r\none, will be found to commence in the eighth line of the first\r\nsection. The House has inserted words limiting the operation of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau to those sections of country within which the writ\r\nof _habeas corpus_ was suspended on the 1st day of February, 1866. As\r\nthe bill passed the Senate, it will be remembered that it extended to\r\nrefugees and freedmen in all parts of the United States, and the\r\nPresident was authorized to divide the section of country containing\r\nsuch refugees and freedmen into districts. The House amend that so as\r\nto authorize the President to divide the section of country within\r\nwhich the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ was suspended on\r\nthe 1st day of February, 1866, containing such refugees and freedmen,\r\ninto districts. The writ of _habeas corpus_ on the 1st day of February\r\nlast was suspended in the late rebellious States, including Kentucky,\r\nand in none other. The writ of _habeas corpus_ was restored by the\r\nPresident's proclamation in Maryland, in Delaware, and in Missouri,\r\nall of which have been slaveholding States.\r\n\r\n\"As the bill passed the Senate, it will be observed it only extended\r\nto refugees and freedmen in the United States, wherever they might be,\r\nand the President was authorized to divide the region of country\r\ncontaining such refugees and freedmen, and it had no operation except\r\nin States where there were refugees and freedmen. The House has\r\nlimited it so that it will not have operation in Maryland, or\r\nDelaware, or Missouri, or any of the Northern States.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Trumbull had stated the other and less important amendments\r\nmade by the House, the Senate proceeded to consider the amendments\r\nproposed by the Judiciary Committee, the first of which was to strike\r\nout the words \"within which the privileges of the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_ was suspended on the 1st day of February, 1866.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull said: \"I wish to say upon that point that the bill as it\r\npassed the Senate can have no operation except in regions of country\r\nwhere there are refugees and freedmen. It is confined to those\r\ndistricts of country, and it could not have operation in most of the\r\nloyal States. But it is desirable, as I am informed, and it was so\r\nstated by one of the Senators from Maryland, that the operations of\r\nthis bill should be extended to Maryland. It may be necessary that it\r\nshould be extended to Missouri, and possibly to Delaware. I trust not;\r\nbut the authority to extend it there ought to exist, if there should\r\nbe occasion for it. The only objection I have to limiting the\r\noperation of the bill to the late slaveholding States is, that I think\r\nit bad legislation, when we are endeavoring to break down\r\ndiscrimination and distinction, to pass a law which is to operate in\r\none State of the Union and not in another. I would rather that the law\r\nshould be general, although I am fully aware that there is nothing for\r\nthe law to operate upon in most of the States of the Union. I do not\r\nfeel quite willing to vote upon Kentucky, for instance, a law that I\r\nam not willing to have applicable to the State of Illinois, if such a\r\nstate of facts exists as that the law can operate in Illinois. I\r\nprefer, therefore, to have the bill in the shape in which it passed\r\nthe Senate, and such was the opinion of the Committee on the\r\nJudiciary.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Guthrie, of Kentucky, spoke with much feeling upon the bearings of\r\nthe bureau upon his State: \"You will have to acknowledge these States\r\nor you will have to do worse. The passage of this system of bills is a\r\ndissolution of the Union, and you can not help it. It will be\r\nimpossible for you to carry on this Government under any such system.\r\nWhen the Union is not to be restored, when there is nothing of that\r\nfeeling to make the people endure, do you suppose they will endure\r\nforever? Do you suppose this bill will attach the people in these\r\neleven States more thoroughly to the Union than they felt when they\r\nreörganized their State governments, passed laws manumitting their\r\nslaves, electing their Legislatures, and doing all that was indicated\r\nas necessary to be done? Do you suppose that there will ever come a\r\ntime, under this bill, that they will desire to become members of this\r\nUnion once more? I see in this bill exactly how Kentucky is tolerated\r\nhere; for as to having part in this legislation, when she is charged\r\nopenly with being ruled at home by rebels, our counsels can be of no\r\ngood here; but still we are not to be driven from the Union, and from\r\nraising our voice in favor of it, and raising it in favor of\r\nconciliation and confidence from one section to the other. Gentlemen\r\ndo not get these doctrines of hatred and vengeance from the Gospel.\r\nThese are not the doctrines taught by the Savior of the world. While\r\nyou cry for justice to the African, you are not slow to commit wrong\r\nand outrage on the white race.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, there were rebels in all the States, and will be again if you\r\ndrive these people to desperation. The Senator from Massachusetts, if\r\nI understood his language aright, threatened us with war or worse if\r\nwe did not yield to his suggestions, and the Senator from Indiana\r\nintimated very strongly the same thing. You have strength enough to\r\ncarry these measures, if it is the sentiment of the nation; but we are\r\nnot a people to be alarmed by words or threats.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman had been, as he said, \"during this whole debate, rather a\r\nspectator than a participant.\" Not desiring to commit himself too\r\nhastily, he had reserved his opinion that he might act and vote\r\nunderstandingly, without feeling, or prejudice, or passion. It was\r\nafter full reflection that he voted for the bill so harshly\r\ncharacterized by the Senator from Kentucky, who had evinced a degree\r\nof feeling entirely uncalled for. Mr. Sherman said further: \"I look\r\nupon the Freedman's Bureau Bill as simply a temporary protection to\r\nthe freedmen in the Southern States. We are bound by every\r\nconsideration of honor, by every obligation that can rest on any\r\npeople, to protect the freedmen from the rebels of the Southern\r\nStates; ay, sir, and to protect them from the loyal men of the\r\nSouthern States. We know that, on account of the prejudices instilled\r\nby the system of slavery pervading all parts of the Southern States,\r\nthe Southern people will not do justice to the freedmen of those\r\nStates. We know that in the course of the war the freedmen have been\r\nemancipated; that they have aided us in this conflict; and, therefore,\r\nwe are bound, by every consideration of honor, faith, and of public\r\nmorals, to protect and maintain all the essential incidents of freedom\r\nto them. I have no doubt that in doing this we shall encounter the\r\nprejudices not only of rebels, but of loyal men; but still the\r\nobligation and guarantee is none the less binding on us. We must\r\nmaintain their freedom, and with it all the incidents and all the\r\nrights of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson, of Missouri, like the Senator from Ohio, had hitherto\r\ntaken no part in the discussion. He was opposed to the limitations\r\nplaced upon the bill by the House of Representatives. \"I would not\r\nhave voted for it if it had not been carried to my own State; and if\r\nthis amendment of the House of Representatives is to be adopted, I\r\nwill not vote for the bill. I want the bill to be made general. If it\r\nis to be made special, if it is to be applied to Kentucky only, I\r\nappreciate the feeling that drove my friend from Kentucky to make the\r\nmost unfortunate remark that has been made upon the floor of the\r\nSenate since 1861. I sincerely hope, for the good of the country, that\r\nthe distinguished Senator may see fit to take back what he said a few\r\nmoments ago.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we have had enough of disunion. I hope that no Senator in the\r\nfuture will rise upon this floor and talk, under any circumstances\r\nwhatever, of another war of rebellion against the constituted\r\nauthorities of this country. My God! are we again to pass through the\r\nscenes of blood through which we have passed for the last four years?\r\nAre we to have this war repeated? No Freedmen's Bureau Bill, no bill\r\nfor the protection of the rights of any body, shall ever drive me to\r\ndream of such a thing.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson thought a better protection for the negro than the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau would be the ballot. He said: \"I live in a State\r\nthat was a slaveholding State until last January a year ago. I have\r\nbeen a slaveholder all my life until the day when the ordinance of\r\nemancipation was passed in my State. I advocated it, and have\r\nadvocated emancipation for the last four years, at least since this\r\nwar commenced. Do you want to know how to protect the freedmen of the\r\nSouthern States? This bill is useless for that purpose. It is not the\r\nintention of the honorable Senators on this floor from Northern\r\nStates, who favor this bill, to send military men to plunder the good\r\npeople of Kentucky. It is an attempt to enforce this moral and\r\nreligious sentiment of the people of the Northern States. Sir, these\r\nfreedmen will be protected. The decree of Almighty God has gone forth,\r\nas it went forth in favor of their freedom originally, that they shall\r\nbe endowed with all the rights that belong to other men. Will you\r\nprotect them? Give them the ballot, Mr. President, and then they are\r\nprotected.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to the remarks by Mr. Henderson, Mr. Trumbull said: \"The\r\nzeal of my friend from Missouri seems to have run away with him.\r\nHaving come from being a slaveholder to the position of advocating\r\nuniversal negro suffrage as the sovereign remedy for every thing, he\r\nmanifests a degree of zeal which I have only seen equaled, I confess,\r\nby some of the discoverers of patent medicines who have found a grand\r\nspecific to cure all diseases! Why, he says this bureau is of no\r\naccount; give the negro the ballot, and that will stop him from\r\nstarving; that will feed him; that will educate him! You have got on\r\nyour hands to-day one hundred thousand feeble indigent, infirm colored\r\npopulation that would starve and die if relief were not afforded; and\r\nthe Senator from Missouri tells you, 'This is all nonsense; give them\r\nthe right of suffrage, and that is all they want.' This to feed the\r\nhungry and clothe the naked! He has voted for these bills; but if you\r\nwill only just give the right of suffrage, you do not want to take\r\ncare of any starving man, any orphan child, any destitute and feeble\r\nperson that can not take care of himself! It is the most sovereign\r\nremedy that I have heard of since the days of Townsend's\r\nSarsaparilla.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the feeling manifested by Mr. Guthrie, Mr. Trumbull said:\r\n\" God forbid that I should put a degradation on the people of\r\nKentucky. I never thought of such a thing. I would sooner cut off my\r\nright hand than do such a thing. What is it that so excites and\r\ninflames the mind of the Senator from Kentucky that he talks about the\r\ndegradation that is to be put upon her, the plunder of her people, the\r\ninjustice that is to be done her inhabitants? Why, sir, a bill to help\r\nthe people of Kentucky to take care of the destitute negroes, made\r\nfree without any property whatever, without the means of support, left\r\nto starve and to die unless somebody cares for them; and we propose in\r\nthe Congress of the United States to help to do it. Is that a\r\ndegradation? Is that an injustice? Is that the way to rob a people?\"\r\n\r\nMr. McDougall having subsequently obtained the floor, made the remark:\r\n\"I, being a white man, say for the white men and white women that they\r\nwill take care of themselves. This bill was not made for white women\r\nor white men, or white men and women's children.\"\r\n\r\nThis brought out the following statistical statement from Mr.\r\nTrumbull: \"I have before me the official report, which shows the\r\nconsolidated number of rations issued in the different districts and\r\nStates during the month of June, July, August, September, and October,\r\n1865. In June there were issued to refugees three hundred and thirteen\r\nthousand six hundred and twenty-seven rations, and thirty six thousand\r\none hundred and eighty-one to freedmen. In August, in Kentucky and\r\nTennessee, there were issued to refugees eighty-seven thousand one\r\nhundred and eighty rations, and to freedmen eighty-seven thousand one\r\nhundred and ninety-five--almost an equality.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson, of Maryland remarked: \"The object of the bill is a very\r\ncorrect one; these people should be taken care of; and as it is\r\nequally applicable to the whites and to the blacks, and the whites in\r\nmany of the States requiring as much protection as the blacks, I would\r\nvery willingly vote for the bill if I thought we had the power to pass\r\nit; but on the question of power I have no disposition now or perhaps\r\nat any time in the present stage of the bill to trouble the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill soon after passed the Senate as amended in the House, and\r\nreämended in the Senate, by a vote of twenty-nine to seven.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the amendments of the Senate were concurred in\r\nby the House without debate, and the Freedmen's Bureau Bill was ready\r\nto be submitted to the Executive.\r\n\r\nTen day's after the final passage of the bill, the President sent to\r\nthe Senate a message, \"with his objection thereto in writing.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate immediately suspended other business to hear the VETO\r\nMESSAGE, which was read by the Secretary, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\n     \"I have examined with care the bill which originated in the\r\n     Senate, and has been passed by the two houses of Congress,\r\n     to amend an act entitled 'An act to establish a Bureau for\r\n     the relief of Freedmen and Refugees,' and for other\r\n     purposes. Having, with much regret, come to the conclusion\r\n     that it would not be consistent with the public welfare to\r\n     give my approval to the measure, I return the bill to the\r\n     Senate with my objections to its becoming a law.\r\n\r\n     \"I might call to mind, in advance of these objections, that\r\n     there is no immediate necessity for the proposed measure.\r\n     The act to establish a Bureau for the relief of Freedmen and\r\n     Refugees, which was approved in the month of March last, has\r\n     not yet expired. It was thought stringent and extensive\r\n     enough for the purpose in view in time of war. Before it\r\n     ceases to have effect, further experience may assist to\r\n     guide us to a wise conclusion as to the policy to be adopted\r\n     in time of peace.\r\n\r\n     \"I share with Congress the strongest desire to secure to the\r\n     freedmen the full enjoyment of their freedom and property,\r\n     and their entire independence and equality in making\r\n     contracts for their labor; but the bill before me contains\r\n     provisions which, in my opinion, are not warranted by the\r\n     Constitution, and are not well suited to accomplish the end\r\n     in view.\r\n\r\n     \"The bill proposes to establish by authority of Congress,\r\n     military jurisdiction over all parts of the United States\r\n     containing refugees and freedmen. It would, by its very\r\n     nature, apply with most force to those parts of the United\r\n     States in which the freedmen most abound; and it expressly\r\n     extends the existing temporary jurisdiction of the\r\n     Freedmen's Bureau, with greatly enlarged powers, over those\r\n     States 'in which the ordinary course of judicial proceeding,\r\n     has been interrupted by the rebellion.' The source from\r\n     which this military jurisdiction is to emanate is none other\r\n     than the President of the United States, acting through the\r\n     War Department and the commissioner of the Freedmen's\r\n     Bureau. The agents to carry out this military jurisdiction\r\n     are to be selected either from the army or from civil life;\r\n     the country is to be divided into districts and\r\n     sub-districts; and the number of salaried agents to be\r\n     employed may be equal to the number of counties or parishes\r\n     in all the United States where freedmen and refugees are to\r\n     be found.\r\n\r\n     \"The subjects over which this military jurisdiction is to\r\n     extend in every part of the United States include protection\r\n     to 'all employés, agents, and officers of this bureau in the\r\n     exercise of the duties imposed' upon them by the bill. In\r\n     eleven States it is further to extend over all cases\r\n     affecting freedmen and refugees discriminated against' by\r\n     local law, custom, or prejudice.' In those eleven States the\r\n     bill subjects any white person who may be charged with\r\n     depriving a freedman of 'any civil rights or immunities\r\n     belonging to white persons' to imprisonment or fine, or\r\n     both, without, however, defining the 'civil rights and\r\n     immunities' which are thus to be secured to the freedmen by\r\n     military law. This military jurisdiction also extends to all\r\n     questions that may arise respecting contracts. The agent who\r\n     is thus to exercise the office of a military judge may be a\r\n     stranger, entirely ignorant of the laws of the place, and\r\n     exposed to the errors of judgment to which all men are\r\n     liable. The exercise of power, over which there is no legal\r\n     supervision, by so vast a number of agents as is\r\n     contemplated by the bill, must, by the very nature of man,\r\n     be attended by acts of caprice, injustice, and passion.\r\n\r\n     \"The trials, having their origin under this bill, are to\r\n     take place without the intervention of a jury, and without\r\n     any fixed rules of law or evidence. The rules on which\r\n     offenses are to be 'heard and determined' by the numerous\r\n     agents, are such rules and regulations as the President,\r\n     through the War Department, shall prescribe. No previous\r\n     presentment is required, nor any indictment charging the\r\n     commission of a crime against the laws; but the trial must\r\n     proceed on charges and specifications. The punishment will\r\n     be, not what the law declares, but such as a court-martial\r\n     may think proper; and from these arbitrary tribunals there\r\n     lies no appeal, no writ of error to any of the courts in\r\n     which the Constitution of the United States vests\r\n     exclusively the judicial power of the country.\r\n\r\n     \"While the territory and the classes of actions and offenses\r\n     that are made subject to this measure are so extensive, the\r\n     bill itself, should it become a law, will have no limitation\r\n     in point of time, but will form a part of the permanent\r\n     legislation of the country. I can not reconcile a system of\r\n     military jurisdiction of this kind with the words of the\r\n     Constitution, which declare that 'no person shall be held to\r\n     answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless upon\r\n     a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases\r\n     arising in the land and naval forces, or in the militia when\r\n     in actual service in time of war or public danger;' and that\r\n     'in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the\r\n     right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of\r\n     the State or district wherein the crime shall have been\r\n     committed.' The safeguards which the experience and wisdom\r\n     of ages taught our fathers to establish as securities for\r\n     the protection of the innocent, the punishment of the\r\n     guilty, and the equal administration of justice, are to be\r\n     set aside, and for the sake of a more vigorous interposition\r\n     in behalf of justice, we are to take the risk of the many\r\n     acts of injustice that would necessarily follow from an\r\n     almost countless number of agents established in every\r\n     parish or county in nearly a third of the States of the\r\n     Union, over whose decisions there is to be no supervision or\r\n     control by the Federal courts. The power that would be thus\r\n     placed in the hands of the President is such as in time of\r\n     peace certainly ought never to be intrusted to any one man.\r\n\r\n     \"If it be asked whether the creation of such a tribunal\r\n     within a State is warranted as a measure of war, the\r\n     question immediately presents itself whether we are still\r\n     engaged in war. Let us not unnecessarily disturb the\r\n     commerce and credit and industry of the country by declaring\r\n     to the American people and to the world, that the United\r\n     States are still in a condition of civil war. At present\r\n     there is no part of our country in which the authority of\r\n     the United States is disputed. Offenses that may be\r\n     committed by individuals should not work a forfeiture of the\r\n     rights of whole communities. The country has returned, or is\r\n     returning, to a state of peace and industry, and the\r\n     rebellion is in fact at an end. The measure, therefore,\r\n     seems to be as inconsistent with the actual condition of the\r\n     country as it is at variance with the Constitution of the\r\n     United States.\r\n\r\n     \"If, passing from general considerations, we examine the\r\n     bill in detail, it is open to weighty objections.\r\n\r\n     \"In time of war it was eminently proper, that we should\r\n     provide for those who were passing suddenly from a condition\r\n     of bondage to a state of freedom. But this bill proposes to\r\n     make the Freedmen's Bureau, established by the act of 1865\r\n     as one of many great and extraordinary military measures to\r\n     suppress a formidable rebellion, a permanent branch of the\r\n     public administration, with its powers greatly enlarged. I\r\n     have no reason to suppose, and I do not understand it to be\r\n     alleged, that the act of March, 1865, has proved deficient\r\n     for the purpose for which it was passed, although at that\r\n     time, and for a considerable period thereafter, the\r\n     Government of the United States remained unacknowledged in\r\n     most of the States whose inhabitants had been involved in\r\n     the rebellion. The institution of slavery, for the military\r\n     destruction of which the Freedmen's Bureau was called into\r\n     existence as an auxiliary, has been already effectually and\r\n     finally abrogated throughout the whole country by an\r\n     amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and\r\n     practically its eradication has received the assent and\r\n     concurrence of most of those States in which it at any time\r\n     had an existence. I am not, therefore, able to discern, in\r\n     the condition of the country, any thing to justify an\r\n     apprehension that the powers and agencies of the Freedmen's\r\n     Bureau, which were effective for the protection of freedmen\r\n     and refugees during the actual continuance of hostilities\r\n     and of African servitude, will now, in a time of peace and\r\n     after the abolition of slavery, prove inadequate to the same\r\n     proper ends. If I am correct in these views, there can be no\r\n     necessity for the enlargement of the powers of the bureau,\r\n     for which provision is made in the bill.\r\n\r\n     \"The third section of the bill authorizes a general and\r\n     unlimited grant of support to the destitute and suffering\r\n     refugees and freedmen, their wives and children. Succeeding\r\n     sections make provision for the rent or purchase of landed\r\n     estates for freedmen, and for the erection for their benefit\r\n     of suitable buildings for asylums and schools, the expenses\r\n     to be defrayed from the Treasury of the whole people. The\r\n     Congress of the United States has never heretofore thought\r\n     itself empowered to establish asylums beyond the limits of\r\n     the District of Columbia, except for the benefit of our\r\n     disabled soldiers and sailors. It has never founded schools\r\n     for any class of our own people, not even for the orphans of\r\n     those who have fallen in the defense of the Union; but has\r\n     left the care of education to the much more competent and\r\n     efficient control of the States, of communities, of private\r\n     associations, and of individuals. It has never deemed itself\r\n     authorized to expend the public money for the rent or\r\n     purchase of homes for the thousands, not to say millions, of\r\n     the white race, who are honestly toiling from day to day for\r\n     their subsistence. A system for the support of indigent\r\n     persons in the United States was never contemplated by the\r\n     authors of the Constitution, nor can any good reason be\r\n     advanced why, as a permanent establishment, it should be\r\n     founded for one class or color of our people more than\r\n     another. Pending the war, many refugees and freedmen\r\n     received support from the Government, but it was never\r\n     intended that they should thenceforth be fed, clothed,\r\n     educated, and sheltered by the United States. The idea on\r\n     which the slaves were assisted to freedom was that, on\r\n     becoming free, they would be a self-sustaining population.\r\n     Any legislation that shall imply that they are not expected\r\n     to attain a self-sustaining condition must have a tendency\r\n     injurious alike to their character and their prospects.\r\n\r\n     \"The appointment of an agent for every county and parish\r\n     will create an immense patronage; and the expense of the\r\n     numerous officers and their clerks, to be appointed by the\r\n     President, will be great in the beginning, with a tendency\r\n     steadily to increase. The appropriations asked by the\r\n     Freedmen's Bureau, as now established, for the year 1866,\r\n     amount to $11,745,000. It may be safely estimated that the\r\n     cost to be incurred under the pending bill will require\r\n     double that amount--more than the entire sum expended in any\r\n     one year under the administration of the second Adams. If\r\n     the presence of agents in every parish and county is to be\r\n     considered as a war measure, opposition, or even resistance,\r\n     might be provoked, so that, to give effect to their\r\n     jurisdiction, troops would have to be stationed within reach\r\n     of every one of them, and thus a large standing force be\r\n     rendered necessary. Large appropriations would therefore be\r\n     re-required to sustain and enforce military jurisdiction in\r\n     every county or parish from the Potomac to the Rio Grande.\r\n     The condition of our fiscal affairs is encouraging, but, in\r\n     order to sustain the present measure of public confidence,\r\n     it is necessary that we practice not merely customary\r\n     economy, but, as far as possible, severe retrenchment.\r\n\r\n     \"In addition to the objections already stated, the fifth\r\n     section of the bill proposes to take away land from its\r\n     former owners without any legal proceedings being first had,\r\n     contrary to that provision of the Constitution which\r\n     declares that no person shall 'be deprived of life, liberty,\r\n     or property, without due process of law.' It does not appear\r\n     that a part of the lands to which this section refers may\r\n     not be owned by minors or persons of unsound mind, or by\r\n     those who have been faithful to all their obligations as\r\n     citizens of the United States. If any portion of the land is\r\n     held by such persons, it is not competent for any authority\r\n     to deprive them of it. If, on the other hand, it be found\r\n     that the property is liable to confiscation, even then it\r\n     can not be appropriated to public purposes until, by due\r\n     process of law, it shall have been declared forfeited to the\r\n     Government.\r\n\r\n     \"There is still further objection to the bill on grounds\r\n     seriously affecting the class of persons to whom it is\r\n     designed to bring relief; it will tend to keep the mind of\r\n     the freedman in a state of uncertain expectation and\r\n     restlessness, while to those among whom he lives it will be\r\n     a source of constant and vague apprehension.\r\n\r\n     \"Undoubtedly the freedman should be protected, but he should\r\n     be protected by the civil authorities, especially by the\r\n     exercise of all the constitutional powers of the courts of\r\n     the United States and of the States. His condition is not so\r\n     exposed as may at first be imagined. He is in a portion of\r\n     the country where his labor can not well be spared.\r\n     Competition for his services from planters, from those who\r\n     are constructing or repairing railroads, and from\r\n     capitalists in his vicinage or from other States, will\r\n     enable him to command almost his own terms. He also\r\n     possesses a perfect right to change his place of abode; and\r\n     if, therefore, he does not find in one community or State a\r\n     mode of life suited to his desires, or proper remuneration\r\n     for his labor, he can move to another, where that labor is\r\n     more esteemed and better rewarded. In truth, however, each\r\n     State, induced by its own wants and interests, will do what\r\n     is necessary and proper to retain within its borders all the\r\n     labor that is needed for the development of its resources.\r\n     The laws that regulate supply and demand will maintain their\r\n     force, and the wages of the laborer will be regulated\r\n     thereby. There is no danger that the exceedingly great\r\n     demand for labor will not operate in favor of the laborer.\r\n\r\n     \"Neither is sufficient consideration given to the ability of\r\n     the freedmen to protect and take care of themselves. It is\r\n     no more than justice to them to believe that, as they have\r\n     received their freedom with moderation and forbearance, so\r\n     they will distinguish themselves by their industry and\r\n     thrifty and soon show the world that, in a condition of\r\n     freedom, they are self-sustaining, capable of selecting\r\n     their own employment and their own places of abode, of\r\n     insisting for themselves on a proper remuneration, and of\r\n     establishing and maintaining their own asylums and schools.\r\n     It is earnestly hoped that, instead of wasting away, they\r\n     will, by their own efforts, establish for themselves a\r\n     condition of respect, ability, and prosperity. It is certain\r\n     that they can attain to that condition only through their\r\n     own merits and exertions.\r\n\r\n     \"In this connection the query presents itself, whether the\r\n     system proposed by the bill will not, when put into complete\r\n     operation, practically transfer the entire care, support,\r\n     and control of four million emancipated slaves to agents,\r\n     overseers, or taskmasters, who, appointed at Washington, are\r\n     to be located in every county and parish throughout the\r\n     United States containing freedmen and refugees? Such a\r\n     system would inevitably tend to a concentration of power in\r\n     the Executive which would enable him, if so disposed, to\r\n     control the action of this numerous class and use them for\r\n     the attainment of his own political ends.\r\n\r\n     \"I can not but add another very grave objection to this\r\n     bill: The Constitution imperatively declares, in connection\r\n     with taxation, that each State shall have at least one\r\n     Representative, and fixes the rule for the number to which,\r\n     in future times, each State shall be entitled. It also\r\n     provides that the Senate of the United States shall be\r\n     composed of two Senators from each State, and adds, with\r\n     peculiar force, 'that no State, without its consent, shall\r\n     be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.'. The\r\n     original act was necessarily passed in the absence of the\r\n     States chiefly to be affected, because their people were\r\n     then contumaciously engaged in the rebellion. Now the case\r\n     is changed, and some, at least, of those States are\r\n     attending Congress by loyal Representatives, soliciting the\r\n     allowance of the constitutional right of representation. At\r\n     the time, however, of the consideration and the passing of\r\n     this bill, there was no Senator or Representative in\r\n     Congress from the eleven States which are to be mainly\r\n     affected by its provisions. The very fact that reports were\r\n     and are made against the good disposition of the people of\r\n     that portion of the country is an additional reason why they\r\n     need, and should have, Representatives of their own in\r\n     Congress to explain their condition, reply to accusations,\r\n     and assist, by their local knowledge, in the perfecting of\r\n     measures immediately affecting themselves. While the liberty\r\n     of deliberation would then be free, and Congress would have\r\n     full power to decide according to its judgment, there could\r\n     be no objection urged that the States most interested had\r\n     not been permitted to be heard. The principle is firmly\r\n     fixed in the minds of the American people that there should\r\n     be no taxation without representation.\r\n\r\n     \"Great burdens have now to be borne by all the country, and\r\n     we may best demand that they shall be borne without murmur\r\n     when they are voted by a majority of the Representatives of\r\n     all the people. I would not interfere with the\r\n     unquestionable right of Congress to judge, each house for\r\n     itself, 'of the elections, returns, and qualifications of\r\n     its own members,' but that authority can not be construed as\r\n     including the right to shut out, in time of peace, any State\r\n     from the representation to which it is entitled by the\r\n     Constitution. At present, all the people of eleven States\r\n     are excluded--those who were most faithful during the war\r\n     not less than others. The State of Tennessee, for instance,\r\n     whose authorities engaged in rebellion, was restored to all\r\n     her constitutional relations to the Union by the patriotism\r\n     and energy of her injured and betrayed people. Before the\r\n     war was brought to a termination, they had placed themselves\r\n     in relation with the General Government, had established a\r\n     State government of their own; as they were not included in\r\n     the Emancipation Proclamation, they, by their own act, had\r\n     amended their Constitution so as to abolish slavery within\r\n     the limits of their State. I know no reason why the State of\r\n     Tennessee, for example, should not fully enjoy 'all her\r\n     constitutional relations to the United States.'\r\n\r\n     \"The President of the United States stands toward the\r\n     country in a somewhat different attitude from that of any\r\n     member of Congress. Each member of Congress is chosen from a\r\n     single district or State; the President is chosen by the\r\n     people of all the States. As eleven are not at this time\r\n     represented in either branch of Congress, it would seem to\r\n     be his duty, on all proper occasions, to present their just\r\n     claims to Congress. There always will be differences of\r\n     opinion in the community, and individuals may be guilty of\r\n     transgressions of the law; but these do not constitute valid\r\n     objections against the right of a State to representation. I\r\n     would in nowise interfere with the discretion of Congress\r\n     with regard to the qualifications of members; but I hold it\r\n     my duty to recommend to you, in the interests of peace and,\r\n     in the interests of union, the admission of every State to\r\n     its share in public legislation when, however insubordinate,\r\n     insurgent, or rebellious its people may have been, it\r\n     presents itself, not only in an attitude of loyalty and\r\n     harmony, but in the persons of Representatives whose loyalty\r\n     can not be questioned under any existing constitutional or\r\n     legal test.\r\n\r\n     \"It is plain that an indefinite or permanent exclusion of\r\n     any part of the country from representation must be attended\r\n     by a spirit of disquiet and complaint. It is unwise and\r\n     dangerous to pursue a course of measures which will unite a\r\n     very large section of the country against another section of\r\n     the country, however much the latter may preponderate. The\r\n     course of emigration, the development of industry and\r\n     business, and natural causes will raise up at the South men\r\n     as devoted to the Union as those of any other part of the\r\n     land. But if they are all excluded from Congress--if, in a\r\n     permanent statute, they are declared not to be in full\r\n     constitutional relations to the country--they may think they\r\n     have cause to become a unit in feeling and sentiment against\r\n     the Government. Under the political education of the\r\n     American people, the idea is inherent and ineradicable that\r\n     the consent of the majority of the whole people is necessary\r\n     to secure a willing acquiescence in legislation.\r\n\r\n     \"The bill under consideration refers to certain of the\r\n     States as though they had hot 'been fully restored in all\r\n     their constitutional relations to the United States.' If\r\n     they have not, let us at once act together to secure that\r\n     desirable end at the earliest possible moment It is hardly\r\n     necessary for me to inform Congress that, in my own\r\n     judgment, most of these States, so far, at least, as depends\r\n     upon their own action, have already been fully restored,\r\n     and»are to be deemed as entitled to enjoy their\r\n     constitutional rights as members of the Union. Reasoning\r\n     from the Constitution itself, and from the actual situation\r\n     of the country, I feel not only entitled but bound to assume\r\n     that, with the Federal courts restored, and those of the\r\n     several States in the full exercise of their functions, the\r\n     rights and interests of all classes of the people will, with\r\n     the aid of the military in cases of resistance to the laws,\r\n     be essentially protected against unconstitutional\r\n     infringement or violation. Should this expectation unhappily\r\n     fail--which I do not anticipate--then the Executive is\r\n     already fully armed with the powers conferred by the act of\r\n     March, 1865, establishing the Freedmen's Bureau, and\r\n     hereafter, as heretofore, he can employ the land and naval\r\n     forces of the country to suppress insurrection or to\r\n     overcome obstructions to the laws.\r\n\r\n     \"In accordance with the Constitution, I return the bill to\r\n     the Senate, in the earnest hope that a measure involving\r\n     questions and interests so important to the country will not\r\n     become a law unless, upon deliberate consideration by the\r\n     people, it shall receive the sanction of an enlightened\r\n     public judgment.\r\n\r\n                                             \"ANDREW JOHNSON.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon. S. C. Pomeroy.]\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Senate was in favor of proceeding immediately to\r\nthe consideration of the message, and to have a vote as to whether the\r\nbill should be passed, \"the objections of the President to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.\" To this Mr. Lane, of Kansas, was opposed.\r\nHe said: \"There are several Senators absent, and I think it but just\r\nto them that they should have an opportunity to be present when the\r\nvote is taken on this bill. I can not consent, so long as I can\r\npostpone this question by the rules of the Senate, to have a vote upon\r\nit to-night.\" Mr. Lane accordingly made four successive motions to\r\nadjourn, in each of which he called for the yeas and nays. Finally,\r\nthe motion for adjournment having been made for the fifth time, it was\r\ncarried, with the understanding that the bill should be the pending\r\nquestion at one o'clock on the following day.\r\n\r\nOn that day, February 20th, the bill and the message came duly before\r\nthe Senate. Mr. Davis obtained the floor, and made a long speech in\r\nopposition to the bill and in favor of the Veto Message. He expressed\r\nhis aversion to the bill, and the objects sought to be attained under\r\nit in very emphatic terms, but added nothing to the arguments which\r\nhad already been adduced.\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull replied to the objections urged against the bill in the\r\nPresident's Message. The President said, \"The bill, should it become a\r\nlaw will have no limitation in point of time, but will form a part of\r\nthe permanent legislation of the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"The object of the bill,\" replied Mr. Trumbull, \"was to continue in\r\nexistence the Freedmen's Bureau--not as a permanent institution. Any\r\nsuch intent was disavowed during the discussion of the bill. It is\r\ntrue, no time is expressly limited in the bill itself when it shall\r\ncease to operate, nor is it customary to insert such a clause in a\r\nlaw; but it is declared that the bill shall operate until otherwise\r\nprovided by law. It is known that the Congress of the United States\r\nassembles every year, and no one supposed that this bill was to\r\nestablish a bureau to be ingrafted upon the country as a permanent\r\ninstitution; far from it. Nor is it a bill that is intended to go into\r\nthe States and take control of the domestic affairs of the States.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no immediate necessity for the proposed measure,\" said the\r\nPresident; \"the act to establish a Bureau for the Relief of Freedmen\r\nand Refugees, which was approved in the month of March last, has not\r\nyet expired. It was thought stringent and extensive enough for the\r\npurpose in view in time of war.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull replied: \"By the terms of the act, it was to continue\r\n'during the present war of rebellion and for one year thereafter.'\r\nNow, when did the war of rebellion cease? So far as the conflict of\r\narms is concerned, we all admit that the war of rebellion ceased when\r\nthe last rebel army laid down its arms, and that was some time in the\r\nmonth of May, when the rebel army in Texas surrendered to the Union\r\nforces. I do not hold that the consequences of the war are over. I do\r\nnot understand that peace is restored with all its consequences. We\r\nhave not yet escaped from the evils inflicted by the war. Peace and\r\nharmony are not yet restored, but the war of rebellion is over, and\r\nthis bureau must expire in May next, according to the terms of the act\r\nthat was passed on the 3d of March, 1865, and according to the views\r\nof the President as expressed in his Veto Message.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bill,\" said the President, \"proposes to establish by authority of\r\nCongress, military jurisdiction over all parts of the United States\r\ncontaining refugees and freedmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to know,\" said Mr. Trumbull, \"where in that bill is any\r\nprovision extending military jurisdiction over all parts of the United\r\nStates containing refugees and freedmen? The bill contains no such\r\nclause. It is a misapprehension of the bill. The clause of the bill\r\nupon that subject is this:\r\n\r\n     \"'And the President of the United States, through the War\r\n     Department and the commissioner, shall extend military\r\n     jurisdiction and protection over all employés, agents, and\r\n     officers of this bureau in the exercise of the duties\r\n     imposed or authorized by this act or the act to which this\r\n     is additional.'\r\n\r\n\"Is not the difference manifest to every body between a bill that\r\nextends military jurisdiction over the officers and employés of the\r\nbureau and a bill which should extend military jurisdiction over all\r\nparts of the United States containing refugees and freedmen? This bill\r\nmakes the Freedmen's Bureau a part of the War Department. It makes its\r\nofficers and agents amenable to the Rules and Articles of War. But\r\ndoes that extend jurisdiction over the whole country where they are?\r\nHow do they differ from any other portion of the army of the United\r\nStates? The army of the United States, as every one knows, is governed\r\nby the Rules and Articles of War, wherever it may be, whether in\r\nIndiana or in Florida, and all persons in the army and a part of the\r\nmilitary establishment are subject to these Rules and Articles of War;\r\nbut did any body ever suppose that the whole country where they were\r\nwas under military jurisdiction? If a company of soldiers are\r\nstationed at one of the forts in New York harbor, the officers and\r\nsoldiers of that company are subject to military jurisdiction; but was\r\nit ever supposed that the people of the State of New York were thereby\r\nplaced under military jurisdiction? It is an entire misapprehension of\r\nthe provisions of the bill. It extends military jurisdiction nowhere;\r\nit merely places under jurisdiction the persons belonging to the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau who, nearly all of them, are now under military\r\njurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\n\"The country,\" objected the President, \"is to be divided into\r\ndistricts and sub-districts, and the number of salaried agents to be\r\nemployed may be equal to the number of counties or parishes in all the\r\nStates where freedmen and refugees are to be found.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull replied: \"A single officer need not be employed other\r\nthan those we now have. I have already stated that it is in the power\r\nand discretion of the President to detail from the army officers to\r\nperform all the duties of the Freedmen's Bureau, and, in case they are\r\ndetailed, the bill provides that they shall serve without any\r\nadditional compensation or allowance. But, sir, is it necessary, or\r\nwas it ever contemplated, that there should be an officer or agent of\r\nthe Freedmen's Bureau in every county and every parish where refugees\r\nand freedmen are to be found? By no means. What is the bill upon that\r\nsubject? Does it make it imperative upon the President to appoint an\r\nagent in each county and parish? It authorizes him 'when the same\r\nshall be necessary for the operations of the bureau;' not otherwise.\r\nHe has no authority, under the bill, to appoint a single agent unless\r\nit is necessary for the operations of the bureau, and then he can only\r\nappoint so many as may be needed. Sir, it never entered the mind, I\r\nventure to say, of a single advocate of this bill, that the President\r\nof the United States would so abuse the authority intrusted to him as\r\nto station an agent in every county in these States; but it was\r\napprehended that there might be localities in some of these States\r\nwhere the prejudice and hostility of the white population and the\r\nformer masters were such toward the negroes that it would be necessary\r\nto have an agent in every county in that locality for their\r\nprotection; and, in order to give the President the necessary\r\ndiscretion where this should be requisite, the bill authorized, when\r\nit was necessary for the operations of the bureau, the appointment of\r\nan agent in each county or parish. In order to vest the President with\r\nsufficient power in some localities, it was necessary, legislating by\r\ngeneral law, to give him much larger power than would be necessary in\r\nother localities.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the country is not to be divided, I undertake to say, into\r\ndistricts and sub-districts unless the President of the United States\r\nfinds it necessary to do so for the protection of these people; and if\r\nthe law should be abused in that respect, it would be because he\r\nabused the discretion vested in him by Congress, and not because the\r\nlaw required it. It makes no such requirement.\"\r\n\r\n\"This military jurisdiction,\" said the President, \"also extends to all\r\nquestions that may arise respecting contracts.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far,\" replied Mr. Trumbull, \"from extending this military\r\njurisdiction over all questions arising concerning contracts, and so\r\nfar from extending military jurisdiction anywhere, it is expressly\r\nprovided, by the very terms of the bill, that no such jurisdiction\r\nshall be exercised except where the President himself has established,\r\nand is maintaining military jurisdiction, which he is now doing in\r\neleven States; and the very moment that he ceases to maintain military\r\njurisdiction, that very moment the military jurisdiction conferred\r\nover freedmen by this act ceases and terminates.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the whole jurisdiction to try and dispose of cases by the\r\nofficers and agents of the Freedmen's Bureau is expressly limited to\r\nthe time when these States shall be restored to their constitutional\r\nrelations, and when the courts of the United States and of the States\r\nare not interrupted nor interfered with in the peaceable course of\r\njustice. So far, then, from the bill establishing a military\r\njurisdiction, upon which the Senator from Kentucky and other Senators\r\nhave so much harped, it confers no jurisdiction to try cases one\r\nmoment after the courts are restored, and are no longer interrupted in\r\nthe peaceable administration of justice. Let me ask by what authority\r\nis it that military tribunals are sitting to-day at Alexandria,\r\nVirginia? By what authority is it that the writ of _habeas corpus_ is\r\nsuspended to-day in eleven States, when the Constitution of the United\r\nStates says that the writ shall not be suspended except when, in cases\r\nof rebellion and invasion, the public safety may require it. By what\r\nauthority does the President of the United States object to the\r\nexercise of military jurisdiction by that part of the army charged\r\nwith the execution of the provisions of the Freedmen's Bureau when he\r\nexercises that military jurisdiction himself by other portions of the\r\narmy? But a few days since a military commission was sitting in\r\nAlexandria, trying persons charged with crimes--and they are held all\r\nover the South--and yet that part of the army connected with the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau can not exercise any such authority because it is\r\nunconstitutional--unconstitutional to do by virtue of a law of\r\nCongress what is done without any law!\r\n\r\n\"Where does the Executive get the power? The Executive is but the\r\nCommander-in-chief of the armies, made so by the Constitution; but he\r\ncan not raise an army or a single soldier, he can not appoint a single\r\nofficer, without the consent of Congress. He can not make any rules\r\nand regulations for the government of the army without our permission.\r\nThe Constitution of the United States declares, in so many words, that\r\nCongress shall have power 'to make rules for the government and\r\nregulation of the land and naval forces' of the United States. Can it\r\nbe that that department of the Government, vested in express terms by\r\nthe Constitution itself with authority to make rules for the\r\ngovernment and regulation of the land and naval forces, has no\r\nauthority to direct that portion of the land and naval forces employed\r\nin the Freedmen's Bureau to exercise this jurisdiction instead of\r\ndepartment commanders? Sir, it is competent for Congress to declare\r\nthat no department commanders shall exercise any such authority; it is\r\ncompetent for Congress to declare that a court-martial shall never\r\nsit, that a military commission shall never be held, and the President\r\nis as much bound to obey it as the humblest citizen in the land.\"\r\n\r\nThe President said: \"The trials having their origin under this bill\r\nare to take place without the intervention of a jury, and without any\r\nfixed rules of law or evidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not all military trials take place in that way,\" asked Mr.\r\nTrumbull. \"Did any body ever hear of the presentment of a grand jury\r\nin a case where a court-martial set for the trial of a military\r\noffense, or the trial of a person charged with any offense cognizable\r\nbefore it? This Freedmen's Bureau Bill confers no authority to do this\r\nexcept in those regions of country where military authority prevails,\r\nwhere martial law is established, where persons exercising civil\r\nauthority act in subordination to the military power, and where the\r\nmoment they transcend the proper limits as fixed by military orders,\r\nthey are liable to be arrested and punished without the intervention\r\nof a grand jury, or without the right of appeal to any of the judicial\r\ntribunals of the country. I would as soon think of an appeal from the\r\ndecision of the military tribunal that sat in the city of Washington,\r\nand condemned to death the murderers of our late President, to the\r\njudicial tribunals of the country! Where military authority bears\r\nsway, where the courts are overborne, is it not an absurdity to say\r\nthat you must have a presentment of a grand jury, and a trial in a\r\ncourt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can not reconcile a system of military jurisdiction of this kind\r\nwith the words of the Constitution,\" said the President.\r\n\r\n\"If you can not reconcile a system of military jurisdiction of this\r\nkind with the words of the Constitution, why have you been exercising\r\nit,\" asked Mr. Trumbull. \"Why have you been organizing courts-martial\r\nand military commissions all over the South, trying offenders, and\r\npunishing some of them with death? Why have you authorized the present\r\nFreedmen's Bureau to hold bureau courts all through the South? This\r\nhas all been done by your permission, and is being done to-day. Then,\r\nsir, if you are still in the exercise of this power now, if you have\r\nbeen exercising it from the day you became President of the United\r\nStates, how is it that you can not reconcile a system of jurisdiction\r\nof this kind with the words of the Constitution?\r\n\r\n\"Sir, does it detract from the President's authority to have the\r\nsanction of law? I want to give that sanction. I do not object to the\r\nexercise of this military authority of the President in the rebellious\r\nStates. I believe it is constitutional and legitimate and necessary;\r\nbut I believe Congress has authority to regulate it. I believe\r\nCongress has authority to direct that this military jurisdiction shall\r\nbe exercised by that branch of the army known as the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, as well as by any other branch of the army.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rebellion is at an end,\" said the President. \"The measure,\r\ntherefore, seems to be as inconsistent with the actual condition of\r\nthe country as it is at variance with the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull replied: \"If the rebellion is at an end, will anybody\r\ntell me by what authority the President of the United States suspends\r\nthe writ of _habeas corpus_ in those States where it existed. The act\r\nof Congress of March, 1863, authorized the President of the United\r\nStates to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_ during the present\r\nrebellion. He says it is at an end. By what authority, then, does he\r\nsuspend the writ? By his own declaration, let him stand or fall. If it\r\nis competent to suspend the writ, if it is competent for military\r\ntribunals to sit all through the South, and entertain military\r\njurisdiction, this bill, which does not continue military\r\njurisdiction, does not establish military jurisdiction, but only\r\nauthorizes the officers of this bureau, while military jurisdiction\r\nprevails, to take charge of that particular class of cases affecting\r\nthe refugee or freedman where he is discriminated against, can not be\r\nobnoxious to any constitutional objection.\"\r\n\r\n\"This bill,\" said the President, \"proposes to make the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, established by the act of 1865, as one of many great and\r\nextraordinary military measures to suppress a formidable rebellion, a\r\npermanent branch of the public administration, with its powers greatly\r\nenlarged.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a mistake,\" replied Mr. Trumbull; \"it is not intended, I\r\napprehend, by any body, certainly not by me, to make it a permanent\r\nbranch of the public administration; and I am quite sure that the\r\npowers of the bureau are not, by the amendatory bill, greatly\r\nenlarged. A careful examination of the amendment will show that it is\r\nin some respects a restriction on the powers already exercised.\"\r\n\r\n\"The third section of the bill,\" the President objected, \"authorizes a\r\ngeneral and unlimited grant of support to the destitute and suffering\r\nrefugees and freedmen, their wives and children.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the third section of the bill,\" asked Mr. Trumbull, \"which\r\nthe President says contains such an unlimited grant of support to the\r\ndestitute and suffering refugees, their wives and children? I will\r\nread that third section:\r\n\r\n     \"'That the Secretary of War may direct such issues of\r\n     provisions, clothing, fuel, including medical stores and\r\n     transportation, and afford such aid, medical or otherwise,\r\n     as he may deem needful for the immediate and temporary\r\n     shelter and supply of destitute and suffering refugees and\r\n     freedmen, their wives and children, under such rules and\r\n     regulations as he may direct: _Provided_, That no person\r\n     shall be deemed \"destitute,\" \"suffering,\" or \"dependent upon\r\n     the Government for support,\" within the meaning of this act,\r\n     who, being able to find employment, could, by proper\r\n     industry and exertion, avoid such destitution, suffering, or\r\n     dependence.'\r\n\r\n\"Does the President object to this bill on the ground that it\r\nauthorizes medical aid to be furnished the sick? Or does he object to\r\nit because of the proviso which limits its operation, and declares\r\nthat nobody shall be deemed destitute and suffering under the\r\nprovisions of the act who is able, by proper industry and exertion, to\r\navoid such destitution? Why, sir, it is a limitation on the present\r\nexisting law. Does that look much like taking care of four million of\r\npeople--a provision that expressly limits the operations of this act\r\nto those only who can not find employment? A statement of the fact is\r\nall that is necessary to meet this statement in the Veto Message.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Congress of the United States,\" said the President, \"has never\r\nheretofore thought itself empowered to establish asylums beyond the\r\nlimits of the District of Columbia, except for the benefit of our\r\ndisabled soldiers and sailors. It has never founded schools for any\r\nclass of our own people. It has never deemed itself authorized to\r\nexpend the public money for the rent or purchase of homes for the\r\nthousands, not to say millions of the white race who are honestly\r\ntoiling from day to day for their subsistence.\"\r\n\r\n\"The answer to that is this,\" said Mr. Trumbull: \"We never before were\r\nin such a state as now\"; never before in the history of this\r\nGovernment did eleven States of the Union combine together to\r\noverthrow and destroy the Union; never before in the history of this\r\nGovernment have we had a four years' civil war; never before in the\r\nhistory of this Government have nearly four million people been\r\nemancipated from the most abject and degrading slavery ever imposed\r\nupon human beings; never before has the occasion arisen when it was\r\nnecessary to provide for such large numbers of people thrown upon the\r\nbounty of the Government unprotected and unprovided for. But, sir,\r\nwherever the necessity did exist the Government has acted. We have\r\nvoted hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars, and are doing it\r\nfrom year to year, to take care of and provide for the destitute and\r\nsuffering Indians. We appropriated, years ago, hundreds of thousands\r\nof dollars to take care of and feed the savage African who was landed\r\nupon our coast by slavers. We provided by law that whenever savages\r\nfrom Africa should be brought to our shores, or whenever they should\r\nbe captured on board of slavers, the President of the United States\r\nshould make provision for their maintenance and support, for five\r\nyears, on the coast of Africa. He was authorized by law to appoint\r\nagents to go to Africa to provide means to feed them, and we paid the\r\nmoney to do it. And yet, sir, can we not provide for these Africans\r\nwho have been held in bondage all their lives, who have never been\r\npermitted to earn one dollar for themselves, who, by the great\r\nConstitutional Amendment declaring freedom throughout the land, have\r\nbeen discharged from bondage to their masters, who had hitherto\r\nprovided for their necessities in consideration of their services? Can\r\nwe not provide for these destitute persons of our own land on the same\r\nprinciple that we provide for the Indians, that we provide for the\r\nsavage African?\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued Mr. Trumbull, \"the President says we have never\r\nrented lands for the white race, we have never purchased lands for\r\nthem. What do we propose to do by this bill? This authorizes, if the\r\nPresident thinks proper to do it--it is in his discretion--the\r\npurchase or renting of lands on which to place these indigent people;\r\nbut before any land can be purchased or rented, before any contract\r\ncan be made on the subject, there must be an appropriation made by\r\nCongress. This bill contains no appropriation. If the President is\r\nopposed to the rent or purchase of land, and Congress passes a bill\r\nappropriating money for that purpose, let him veto it if he thinks it\r\nunconstitutional; but there is nothing unconstitutional in this bill.\r\nThis bill does not purchase any land; but it prevents even a contract\r\non the subject until another law shall be passed appropriating the\r\nmoney for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, what is the objection to it if it did appropriate the\r\nmoney? I have already undertaken to show, and I think I have shown,\r\nthat it was the duty of the United States, as an independent nation,\r\nas one of the powers of the earth, whenever there came into its\r\npossession an unprotected class of people, who must suffer and perish\r\nbut for its care, to provide for and take care of them. When an army\r\nis marching through an enemy's country, and poor and destitute persons\r\nare found within its lines who must die by starvation if they are not\r\nfed from the supplies of the army, will any body show me the\r\nconstitutional provision or the act of Congress that authorizes the\r\ngeneral commanding to open his commissariat and feed the starving\r\nmultitude? And has it not been done by every one of your commanders\r\nall through the South? Whenever a starving human being, man, woman, or\r\nchild, no matter whether black or white, rebel or loyal, came within\r\nthe lines of the army, to perish and die unless fed from our supplies,\r\nthere has never been an officer in our service, and, thank God! there\r\nhas not been, who did not relieve the sufferer. If you want to know\r\nwhere the constitutional power to do this is, and where the law is, I\r\nanswer, it is in that common humanity that belongs to every man fit to\r\nbear the name, and it is in that power that belongs to us as a\r\nChristian nation, carrying on war upon civilized principles.\r\n\r\n\"If we had the right then to feed those people as we did, have we not\r\nthe right to take care of them in the cheapest way we can? If, when\r\nGeneral Sherman was passing through Georgia, he found the lands\r\nabandoned; if their able-bodied owners had entered the rebel army to\r\nfight against us; if the women and children had fled and left the land\r\na waste, and he had, as is the fact, thousands of persons hanging upon\r\nhis army dependent upon him for supplies; if it was believed that it\r\nwould be cheaper to support these people upon these lands than to buy\r\nprovisions to feed them, might we not do so? May we not resort to\r\nwhatever means is most judicious to protect from starvation that\r\nmultitude which common humanity requires us to feed?\r\n\r\n\"Nor, sir, is it true that no provision has been made by Congress for\r\nthe education of white people. We have given all through the new\r\nStates one section of land in every township for the benefit of common\r\nschools. We have donated hundreds of thousands of acres of land to all\r\nthe States for the establishment of colleges and seminaries of\r\nlearning. How did we get this land? It was purchased by our money, and\r\nthen we gave it away for purposes of education. The same right exists\r\nnow to provide for these people, and it is not simply for the black\r\npeople, but for the white refugees as well as the black, that this\r\nbill provides.\"\r\n\r\nSaid the President: \"The appropriations asked by the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, as now established, for the year 1866, amounts to $11,745,000.\r\nIt may be safely estimated that the cost to be incurred under the\r\npending bill will require double that amount.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull replied: \"A far larger sum, in proportion to the number\r\nthat were thrown upon our hands, was expended before the creation of\r\nthe Freedmen's Bureau, in feeding and taking care of refugees and\r\nfreedmen, than since the establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau. Since\r\nthat time, the authority of the Government has been extended over all\r\nthe rebellious States, and we have had a larger number of refugees and\r\nfreedmen to provide for, but in proportion to the number I have no\r\ndoubt that the expense is less now than it was before the\r\nestablishment of the bureau.\"\r\n\r\n\"The query again presents itself,\" said the President, \"whether the\r\nsystem proposed by the bill will not, when put into complete\r\noperation, practically transfer the entire care, support, and control\r\nof four million emancipated slaves to agents, overseers, or\r\ntaskmasters, who, appointed at Washington, are to be located in every\r\ncounty and parish throughout the United States containing freedmen and\r\nrefugees.\"\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely know how to reply to that most extravagant statement,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Trumbull. \"I have already shown that it would be a great\r\nabuse of the power conferred by this bill to station an agent in every\r\ncounty. I have already stated that but a small proportion of the\r\nfreedmen are aided by the Freedmen's Bureau. In this official document\r\nthe President has sent to Congress the exaggerated statement that it\r\nis a question whether this bureau would not bring under its control\r\nthe four million emancipated slaves. The census of 1860 shows that\r\nthere never were four million slaves in all the United States, if you\r\ncounted every man, woman, and child, and we know that the number has\r\nnot increased during the war. But, sir, what will be thought when I\r\nshow, as I shall directly show by official figures, that, so far from\r\nproviding for four million emancipated slaves, the Freedmen's Bureau\r\nnever yet provided for a hundred thousand, and, as restricted by the\r\nproviso to the third section of the present bill, it could never be\r\nextended, under it, to a larger number. Is it not most extraordinary\r\nthat a bill should be returned with the veto from the President on the\r\nground that it provides for four million people, when, restricted in\r\nits operations as it is, and having been in operation since March\r\nlast, it has never had under its control a hundred thousand? I have\r\nhere an official statement from the Freedmen's Bureau, which I beg\r\nleave to read in this connection:\r\n\r\n     \"'The greatest number of persons to whom rations were\r\n     issued, including the Commissary Department, the bureau\r\n     issues to persons without the army, is one hundred and\r\n     forty-eight thousand one hundred and twenty.'\r\n\r\n\"Who are they? I said there were not a hundred thousand freedmen\r\nprovided for by the bureau.\r\n\r\n     \"'Whites, 57,369; colored, 90,607; Indians, 133. The\r\n     greatest number by the bureau was 49,932, in September. The\r\n     total number for December was 17,025.'\r\n\r\n\"That sounds a little different from four millions. Seventeen thousand\r\nand twenty-five were all that were provided for by the Freedmen's\r\nBureau in the month of December last, the number getting less and less\r\nevery month. Why? Because, by the kind and judicious management of\r\nthat bureau, places of employment were found for these refugees and\r\nfreedmen. When the freedmen were discharged from their masters'\r\nplantations they were assisted to find places of work elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"The President says,\" continued Mr. Trumbull, \"that Congress never\r\nthought of making these provisions for the white people. Let us see\r\nwhat provisions have been made for the white people. Major-General\r\nFisk, Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau for the State of\r\nTennessee, in his testimony given before the Reconstruction Committee,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     \"'During the last year, the rations issued to white people\r\n     in Tennessee have been much in excess of those issued to\r\n     freedmen. When I took charge of my district the Government\r\n     was feeding twenty-five thousand people; in round numbers,\r\n     about seventeen thousand five hundred white persons and\r\n     seven thousand blacks. The month preceding the establishment\r\n     of the Freedmen's Bureau, for rations alone for that class\r\n     of people the sum of $97,000 was paid. My first efforts were\r\n     to reduce the number of those beneficiaries of the\r\n     Government, to withhold the rations, and make the people\r\n     self-supporting as far as possible; and in the course of\r\n     four months I reduced the monthly expenses from $97,000 to\r\n     $5,000.'\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the objections already stated,\" said the President,\r\n\"the fifth section of this bill proposes to take away land from its\r\nformer owners, without any legal proceedings first had.\"\r\n\r\n\"I regret,\" said Mr. Trumbull, \"that a statement like that should\r\ninadvertently (for it must have been inadvertent) have found a place\r\nin this Veto Message. The fifth section of the bill does not propose\r\nto take away lands from any body. I will read it, and we shall see\r\nwhat it is:\r\n\r\n     \"'That the occupants of land under Major-General Sherman's\r\n     special field order, dated at Savannah, January 16, 1865,\r\n     are hereby confirmed in their possession.'\r\n\r\n\"Is not this a different thing from taking away land from any body? Do\r\nyou take a thing away from another person when you have it in your\r\npossession already? This fifth section, so far from taking land from\r\nany body, provides simply for protecting the occupants of the land for\r\nthree years from the 16th of January, 1865, a little less than two\r\nyears from this time. If the section does any thing, it simply\r\nprevents the restoration of this property to its former owners within\r\nthat period, except upon terms to be entered into, satisfactory to the\r\ncommissioner, between the occupant and the former owner. This is all\r\nthere is of it. It is a very different thing from taking away land\r\nfrom its former owners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said the President, \"the freedmen should be protected\r\nby the civil authorities, especially by the exercise of all the\r\nconstitutional powers of the courts of the United States and of the\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see,\" replied Mr. Trumbull, \"how they are protected by the\r\ncivil authority.\" After having read from documents setting forth laws\r\nin reference to freedmen in force in Texas and Mississippi, Mr.\r\nTrumbull continued: \"I have here a number of communications of a\r\nsimilar character, showing that, by the laws in some of the Southern\r\nStates, a pass system still exists, and that the negro really has no\r\nprotection afforded him either by the civil authorities or judicial\r\ntribunals of the State. I have letters showing the same thing in the\r\nState of Maryland, from persons whose character is vouched for as\r\nreliable. Under this state of things, the President tells us that the\r\nfreedman should be protected 'by the exercise of all the\r\nconstitutional powers of the courts of the United States and of the\r\nStates!'\"\r\n\r\n\"He also possesses,\" said the President, referring to the freedman, \"a\r\nperfect right to change his place of abode; and if, therefore, he does\r\nnot find in one community or State a mode of life suited to his\r\ndesires, or proper remuneration for his labor, he can move to another\r\nwhere that labor is more esteemed and better rewarded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir,\" said Mr. Trumbull, \"is there no necessity for some\r\nsupervising care of these people? Are they to be coldly told that they\r\nhave a perfect right to change their place of abode, when, if they are\r\ncaught in a strange neighborhood without a pass, they are liable to be\r\nwhipped? when combinations exist against them that they shall not be\r\npermitted to hire unless to their former master? Are these people,\r\nknowing nothing of geography, knowing not where to go, having never in\r\ntheir lives been ten miles from the place where they were born, these\r\nold women and young children, these feeble persons who are turned off\r\nbecause they can no longer work, to be told to go and seek employment\r\nelsewhere? and is the Government of the United States, which has made\r\nthem free, to stand by and do nothing to save and protect them? Are\r\nthey to be left to the mercy of such legislation as that of\r\nMississippi, to such laws as exist in Texas, to such practices as are\r\ntolerated in Maryland and in Kentucky? Sir, I think some protection is\r\nnecessary for them, and that was the object of this bureau. It was not\r\nintended, and such is not its effect, to interfere with the ordinary\r\nadministration of justice in any State, not even during the rebellion.\r\nThe moment that any State does justice and abolishes all\r\ndiscrimination between whites and blacks in civil rights, the judicial\r\nfunctions of the Freedmen's Bureau cease.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued Mr. Trumbull, \"the President, most strangely of all,\r\ndwells upon the unconstitutionality of this act, without ever having\r\nalluded to that provision of the Constitution which its advocates\r\nclaim gives the authority to pass it. Is it not most extraordinary\r\nthat the President of the United States returns a bill which has\r\npassed Congress, with his objections to it, alleging it to be\r\nunconstitutional, and makes no allusion whatever in his whole message\r\nto that provision of the Constitution which, in the opinion of its\r\nsupporters, clearly gives the authority to pass it? And what is that?\r\nThe second clause of the constitutional amendment, which declares that\r\nCongress shall have authority by appropriate legislation to enforce\r\nthe article, which declares that there shall be neither slavery nor\r\ninvoluntary servitude throughout the United States. If legislation be\r\nnecessary to protect the former slaves against State laws, which allow\r\nthem to be whipped if found away from home without a pass, has not\r\nCongress, under the second clause of the amendment, authority to\r\nprovide it? What kind of freedom is that which the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States guarantees to a man that does not protect him from the\r\nlash if he is caught away from home without a pass? And how can we sit\r\nhere and discharge the constitutional obligation that is upon us to\r\npass the appropriate legislation to protect every man in the land in\r\nhis freedom, when we know such laws are being passed in the South, if\r\nwe do nothing to prevent their enforcement? Sir, so far from the bill\r\nbeing unconstitutional, I should feel that I had failed in my\r\nconstitutional duty if I did not propose some measure that would\r\nprotect these people in their freedom. And yet this clause of the\r\nConstitution seems to have escaped entirely the observation of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n\"The President objects to this bill because it was passed in the\r\nabsence of representation from the rebellious States. If that\r\nobjection be valid, all our legislation affecting those States is\r\nwrong, and has been wrong from the beginning. When the rebellion broke\r\nout, in the first year of the war, we passed a law for collecting a\r\ndirect tax, and we assessed that tax upon all the rebellious States.\r\nAccording to the theory of the President, that was all wrong, because\r\ntaxation and representation did not go together. Those States were not\r\nrepresented. Then, according to this argument, (I will not read all of\r\nit,) we were bound to have received their Representatives, or else not\r\nlegislate for and tax them. He insists they were States in the Union\r\nall the time, and according to the Constitution, each State is\r\nentitled to at least one Representative.\r\n\r\n\"If the argument that Congress can not legislate for States\r\nunrepresented is good now, it was good during the conflict of arms,\r\nfor none of the States whose governments were usurped are yet relieved\r\nfrom military control. If we have no right to legislate for those\r\nStates now, we had no right to impose the direct tax upon them. We had\r\nno right to pass any of our laws that affected them. We had no right\r\nto raise an army to march into the rebellious States while they were\r\nnot represented in the Congress of the United States. We had no right\r\nto pass a law declaring these States in rebellion. Why? The rebels\r\nwere not here to be represented in the American Senate. We had no\r\nright to pass a law authorizing the President to issue a proclamation\r\ndiscontinuing all intercourse with the people of those rebellious\r\nStates; and why? Because they were not represented here. We had no\r\nright to blockade their coast. Why? They were not represented here.\r\nThey are States, says the President, and each State is entitled to two\r\nSenators, and to at least one Representative. Suppose the State of\r\nSouth Carolina had sent to Congress, during the war, a Representative;\r\nhad Congress nothing to do but to admit him, if found qualified? Must\r\nhe be received because he comes from a State, and a State can not go\r\nout of the Union? Why, sir, is any thing more necessary than to state\r\nthis proposition to show its absolute absurdity?\"\r\n\r\nThe President said: \"The President of the United States stands toward\r\nthe country in a somewhat different attitude from that of any member\r\nof Congress. Each member of Congress is chosen from a single district\r\nor State; the President is chosen by the people of all the States. As\r\neleven States are not at this time represented in either branch of\r\nCongress, it would seem to be his duty, on all proper occasions, to\r\npresent their just claims to Congress.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it would not be disrespectful,\" said Mr. Trumbull, \"I should like\r\nto inquire how many votes the President got in those eleven States.\r\nSir, he is no more the representative of those eleven States than I\r\nam, except as he holds a higher position. I came here as a\r\nRepresentative chosen by the State of Illinois; but I came here to\r\nlegislate, not simply for the State of Illinois, but for the United\r\nStates of America, and for South Carolina as well as Illinois. I deny\r\nthat we are simply the Representatives of the districts and States\r\nwhich send us here, or that we are governed by such narrow views that\r\nwe can not legislate for the whole country; and we are as much the\r\nRepresentatives, and, in this particular instance, receive as much of\r\nthe support of those eleven States as did the President himself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull finally remarked: \"The President believes this bill\r\nunconstitutional; I believe it constitutional. He believes that it\r\nwill involve great expense; I believe it will save expense. He\r\nbelieves that the freedmen will be protected without it; I believe he\r\nwill be tyrannized over, abused, and virtually reënslaved, without\r\nsome legislation by the nation for his protection. He believes it\r\nunwise; I believe it to be politic.\"\r\n\r\nWithout further debate, the vote was taken on the question, \"Shall the\r\nbill pass, the objections of the President of the United States\r\nnotwithstanding?\" The Senators voted as follows:\r\n\r\n     YEAS--Messrs. Anthony, Brown, Chandler, Clark, Conness,\r\n     Cragin, Creswell, Fessenden, Foster, Grimes, Harris,\r\n     Henderson, Howard, Howe, Kirkwood, Lane of Indiana, Lane of\r\n     Kansas, Morrill, Nye, Poland, Pomeroy, Ramsey, Sherman,\r\n     Sprague, Sumner, Trumbull, Wade, Williams, Wilson, and\r\n     Yates--30.\r\n\r\n     NAYS--Messrs. Buckalew, Cowan, Davis, Dixon, Doolittle,\r\n     Guthrie, Hendricks, Johnson, McDougall, Morgan, Nesmith,\r\n     Norton, Riddle, Saulsbury, Stewart, Stockton, Van Winkle,\r\n     and Willey--18.\r\n\r\n     ABSENT--Messrs. Foot and Wright--2.\r\n\r\nThe President _pro tempore_ then announced, \"On this question the yeas\r\nare thirty and the nays are eighteen. Two-thirds of the members\r\npresent not having voted for the bill, it is not a law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL IN THE SENATE.\r\n\r\n     Duty of Congress consequent upon the Abolition of Slavery --\r\n     Civil Rights Bill introduced -- Reference to Judiciary\r\n     Committee -- Before the Senate -- Speech by Mr. Trumbull --\r\n     Mr. Saulsbury -- Mr. van Winkle -- Mr. Cowan -- Mr. Howard\r\n     -- Mr. Johnson -- Mr. Davis -- Conversations with Mr.\r\n     Trumbull and Mr. Clark -- Reply of Mr. Johnson -- Remarks by\r\n     Mr. Morrill -- Mr. Davis \"wound up\" -- Mr. Guthrie's Speech\r\n     -- Mr. Hendricks -- Reply of Mr. Lane -- Mr. Wilson -- Mr.\r\n     Trumbull's closing remarks -- Yeas and Nays on the passage\r\n     of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding Congress having proposed an amendment to the\r\nConstitution by which slavery should be abolished, and this amendment\r\nhaving been \"ratified by three-fourths of the several States,\" four\r\nmillions of the inhabitants of the United States were transformed from\r\nslaves into freemen. To leave them with their shackles broken off,\r\nunprotected, in a new and undefined position, would have been a sin\r\nagainst them only surpassed in enormity by the original crime of their\r\nenslavement.\r\n\r\nAs provided in the amendment itself, it devolved upon Congress \"to\r\nenforce this article by appropriate legislation.\" The Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress assembled, realizing that it devolved upon them to define the\r\nextent of the rights, privileges, and duties of the freedmen. That\r\nbody was not slow in meeting the full measure of its responsibility.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the reässembling of Congress after the holidays,\r\nJanuary 5, 1866, Mr. Trumbull, in pursuance of previous notice,\r\nintroduced a bill \"to protect all persons in the United States in\r\ntheir civil rights, and furnish the means of their vindication.\" This\r\nbill, having been read twice, was referred to the Committee on the\r\nJudiciary.\r\n\r\nIt was highly appropriate that this bill, involving the relations of\r\nmillions of the inhabitants of the United States to the Government,\r\nshould be referred to this able committee, selected from among the men\r\nof most distinguished legal ability in the Senate. Its members were\r\nchosen in consideration of their high professional ability, their long\r\nexperience, and exalted standing as jurists. They are the legal\r\nadvisers of the Senate, whose report upon constitutional questions is\r\nentitled to the highest consideration.\r\n\r\nTo such a committee the Senate appropriately referred the Civil Rights\r\nBill, and the nation could safely trust in their hands the great\r\ninterests therein involved.\r\n\r\nThe bill declares that \"there shall be no discrimination in civil\r\nrights or immunities among the inhabitants of any State or Territory\r\nof the United States on account of race, color, or previous condition\r\nof slavery; but the inhabitants, of every race and color, without\r\nregard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude,\r\nexcept as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been\r\nduly convicted, shall have the same right to make and enforce\r\ncontracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to inherit,\r\npurchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property,\r\nand to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the\r\nsecurity of person and property, and shall be subject to like\r\npunishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other, any law, statute,\r\nordinance, regulation, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding. Any\r\nperson who, under cover of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or\r\ncustom, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any inhabitant of any\r\nState or Territory to the deprivation of any right secured or\r\nprotected by the act, or to different punishment, pains, or penalties,\r\non account of such person having at any time been held in a condition\r\nof slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime\r\nwhereof the party shall have been duly convicted, or by reason of his\r\ncolor or race, than is prescribed for the punishment of white persons,\r\nis to be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction, to be\r\npunished by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or imprisonment not exceeding\r\none year, or both, in the discretion of the court.\"\r\n\r\nOther provisions of the bill relate to the courts which shall have\r\njurisdiction of cases which arise under the act, and the means to be\r\nemployed in its enforcement.\r\n\r\nThat no question might arise as to the constitutionality of the law,\r\nall the provisions which relate to the enforcement of the act were\r\nborrowed from the celebrated Fugitive Slave Law, enacted in 1850. It\r\nwas a happy thought to compel the enemies of the negro themselves, as\r\njudges, to pronounce in favor of the constitutionality of this\r\nordinance. It is an admirable illustration of the progress of the age,\r\nthat the very instruments which were used a few years before to rivet\r\ntighter the chains of the slave, should be employed to break those\r\nvery chains to fragments. It shall forever stand forth to the honor of\r\nAmerican legislation that it attained to more than poetic justice in\r\nusing the very means once employed to repress and crush the negro for\r\nhis defense and elevation.\r\n\r\nWithin less than a week after the reference of this bill to the\r\nJudiciary Committee, it was reported back, with no alteration save a\r\nfew verbal amendments. On account of pressure of other business, it\r\ndid not come up for formal consideration and discussion in the Senate\r\nuntil the 29th of January. On that day Mr. Trumbull, having called up\r\nthe bill for the consideration of the Senate, said:\r\n\r\n\"I regard the bill to which the attention of the Senate is now called,\r\nas the most important measure that has been under its consideration\r\nsince the adoption of the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery.\r\nThat amendment declared that all persons in the United States should\r\nbe free. This measure is intended to give effect to that declaration,\r\nand secure to all persons within the United States practical freedom.\r\nThere is very little importance in the general declaration of abstract\r\ntruths and principles unless they can be carried into effect, unless\r\nthe persons who are to be affected by them have some means of availing\r\nthemselves of their benefits. Of what avail was the immortal\r\ndeclaration 'that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by\r\ntheir Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are\r\nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,' and 'that to secure\r\nthese rights governments are instituted among men,' to the millions of\r\nthe African race in this country who were ground down and degraded,\r\nand subjected to a slavery more intolerable and cruel than the world\r\never before knew? Of what avail was it to the citizen of\r\nMassachusetts, who, a few years ago, went to South Carolina to enforce\r\na constitutional right in court, that the Constitution of the United\r\nStates declared that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to\r\nall the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States?\r\nAnd of what avail will it now be that the Constitution of the United\r\nStates has declared that slavery shall not exist, if in the late\r\nslaveholding States laws are to be enacted and enforced depriving\r\npersons of African descent of privileges which are essential to\r\nfreemen?\r\n\r\n\"It is the intention of this bill to secure those rights. The laws in\r\nthe slaveholding States have made a distinction against persons of\r\nAfrican descent on account of their color, whether free or slave. I\r\nhave before me the statutes of Mississippi. They provide that if any\r\ncolored person, any free negro or mulatto, shall come into that State\r\nfor the purpose of residing there, he shall be sold into slavery for\r\nlife. If any person of African descent residing in that State travels\r\nfrom one county to another without having a pass or a certificate of\r\nhis freedom, he is liable to be committed to jail, and to be dealt\r\nwith as a person who is in the State without authority. Other\r\nprovisions of the statute prohibit any negro or mulatto from having\r\nfirearms; and one provision of the statute declares that for\r\n'exercising the functions of a minister of the Gospel, free negroes\r\nand mulattoes, on conviction, may be punished by any number of lashes\r\nnot exceeding thirty-nine, on the bare back, and shall pay the costs.\"\r\nOther provisions of the statute of Mississippi prohibit a free negro\r\nor mulatto from keeping a house of entertainment, and subject him to\r\ntrial before two justices of the peace and five slaveholders for\r\nviolating the provisions of this law. The statutes of South Carolina\r\nmake it a highly penal offense for any person, white or colored, to\r\nteach slaves; and similar provisions are to be found running through\r\nall the statutes of the late slaveholding States.\r\n\r\n\"When the constitutional amendment was adopted and slavery abolished,\r\nall these statutes became null and void, because they were all passed\r\nin aid of slavery, for the purpose of maintaining and supporting it.\r\nSince the abolition of slavery, the Legislatures which have assembled\r\nin the insurrectionary States have passed laws relating to the\r\nfreedmen, and in nearly all the States they have discriminated against\r\nthem. They deny them certain rights, subject them to severe penalties,\r\nand still impose upon them the very restrictions which were imposed\r\nupon them in consequence of the existence of slavery, and before it\r\nwas abolished. The purpose of the bill under consideration is to\r\ndestroy all these discriminations, and to carry into effect the\r\nconstitutional amendment.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having stated somewhat at length the grounds upon which he\r\nplaced this bill, Mr. Trumbull closed by saying: \"Most of the\r\nprovisions of this bill are copied from the late Fugitive Slave Act,\r\nadopted in 1850 for the purpose of returning fugitives from slavery\r\ninto slavery again. The act that was passed at that time for the\r\npurpose of punishing persons who should aid negroes to escape to\r\nfreedom is now to be applied by the provisions of this bill to the\r\npunishment of those who shall undertake to keep them in slavery.\r\nSurely we have the authority to enact a law as efficient in the\r\ninterests of freedom, now that freedom prevails throughout the\r\ncountry, as we had in the interest of slavery when it prevailed in a\r\nportion of the country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Saulsbury took an entirely different view of the subject under\r\nconsideration: \"I regard this bill,\" he said, \"as one of the most\r\ndangerous that was ever introduced into the Senate of the United\r\nStates, or to which the attention of the American people was ever\r\ninvited. During the last four or five years, I have sat in this\r\nchamber and witnessed the introduction of bills into this body which I\r\nthought obnoxious to many very grave and serious constitutional\r\nobjections; but I have never, since I have been a member of the body,\r\nseen a bill so fraught with danger, so full of mischief, as the bill\r\nnow under consideration.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not follow the honorable Senator into a consideration of the\r\nmanner in which slaves were treated in the Southern States, nor the\r\nprivileges that have been denied to them by the laws of the States. I\r\nthink the time for shedding tears over the poor slave has well nigh\r\npassed in this country. The tears which the honest white people of\r\nthis country have been made to shed from the oppressive acts of this\r\nGovernment, in its various departments, during the last four years,\r\ncall more loudly for my sympathies than those tears which have been\r\nshedding and dropping and dropping for the last twenty years in\r\nreference to the poor, oppressed slave--dropping from the eyes of\r\nstrong-minded women and weak-minded men, until, becoming a mighty\r\nflood, they have swept away, in their resistless force, every trace of\r\nconstitutional liberty in this country.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is a foregone conclusion that this measure, as one of a\r\nseries of measures, is to be passed through this Congress regardless\r\nof all consequences. But the day that the President of the United\r\nStates places his approval and signature to that Freedmen's Bureau\r\nBill, and to this bill, he will have signed two acts more dangerous to\r\nthe liberty of his countrymen, more disastrous to the citizens of this\r\ncountry, than all the acts which have been passed from the foundation\r\nof the Government to the present hour; and if we on this side of the\r\nchamber manifest anxiety and interest in reference to these bills, and\r\nthe questions involved in them, it is because, having known this\r\npopulation all our lives, knowing them in one hour of our infancy\r\nbetter than you gentlemen have known them all your lives, we feel\r\ncompelled, by a sense of duty, earnestly and importunately, it may be,\r\nto appeal to the judgment of the American Senate, and to reach, if\r\npossible, the judgment of the great mass of the American people, and\r\ninvoke their attention to the awful consequences involved in measures\r\nof this character. Sir, stop, stop! the mangled, bleeding body of the\r\nConstitution of your country lies in your path; you are treading upon\r\nits bleeding body when you pass these laws.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having argued at considerable length that this bill would be a\r\nmost unconstitutional interference on the part of the Federal\r\nGovernment with \"the powers of the States under the Federal\r\nConstitution,\" the Senator from Delaware thus concluded:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, from early boyhood I was taught to love and revere the Federal\r\nUnion and those who made it. In early childhood I read the words of\r\nthe Father of his country, in which he exhorted the people to cling to\r\nthe union of these States as the palladium of liberty, and my young\r\nheart bounded with joy in reading the burning words of lofty\r\npatriotism. I was taught in infancy to admire, as far as the infant\r\nmind could admire, our free system of government, Federal and State;\r\nand I heard the old men say that the wit of man never devised a better\r\nor more lovely system of government. When I arrived at that age when I\r\ncould study and reflect for myself, the teachings of childhood were\r\napproved by the judgment of the man.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen how under this Union we had become great in the eyes of\r\nall nations; and I see now, notwithstanding the horrible afflictions\r\nof war, if we can have wisdom in council and sincere purpose to\r\nsubserve the good of the whole people of the United States, though\r\nmuch that was dear to us has been blasted as by the pestilence that\r\nwalketh in darkness and the destruction that wasteth at noonday, how\r\nwe might, in the providence of God, resume our former position among\r\nthe nations of the earth, and command the respect of the whole\r\ncivilized world. But, sir, to-day, in viewing and in considering this\r\nbill, the thought has occurred to me, how happy were the founders of\r\nour Federal system of government, that they had been taken from the\r\ncouncil chambers of this nation and from among their fellow-men before\r\nbills of this character were seriously presented for legislative\r\nconsideration. Happily for them, they sleep their last sleep, and--\r\n\r\n  \"'How sleep the brave who sink to rest,\r\n    By all their country's wishes blest!\r\n    When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,\r\n    Returns to deck their hallowed mold,\r\n    She there shall dress a sweeter sod\r\n    Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.\r\n\r\n  \"'By fairy hands their knell is rung;\r\n    By forms unseen their dirge is sung;\r\n    There Honor comes, a pilgrim gray,\r\n    To bless the turf that wraps their clay;\r\n    And Freedom shall henceforth repair\r\n    And dwell a weeping hermit there.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Mr. Van Winkle, of West Virginia, addressed the\r\nSenate on the merits of the bill. He thought that the objects sought\r\ncould only be attained through an amendment to the Constitution. He\r\nmoreover said:\r\n\r\n\"We hear a great deal about the sentence from the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, that 'all men are created equal.' I am willing to admit\r\nthat all men are created equal; but how are they equal? Can a citizen\r\nof France, for instance, by going into England, be entitled to all the\r\nrights of a citizen of that country, or by coming into this country\r\nacquire all the rights of an American, unless he is naturalized? Can a\r\ncitizen of our country, by going into any other, become entitled to\r\nthe rights of a citizen there? If not, it may be said that they are\r\nnot equal. I believe that the division of men into separate\r\ncommunities, and their living in society and association with their\r\nfellows, as they do, are both divine institutions, and that,\r\nconsequently, the authors of the Declaration of Independence could\r\nhave meant nothing more than that the rights of citizens of any\r\ncommunity are equal to the rights of all other citizens of that\r\ncommunity. Whenever all communities are conducted in accordance with\r\nthese principles, these very conditions of their prosperous existence,\r\nthen all mankind will be equal, each enjoying his equality in his own\r\ncommunity, and not till then. Therefore, I assert that there is no\r\nright that can be exercised by any community of society more perfect\r\nthan that of excluding from citizenship or membership those who are\r\nobjectionable. If a little society is formed for a benevolent,\r\nliterary, or any other purpose, the members immediately exercise, and\r\nclaim the right to exercise, that right; they determine who shall come\r\ninto their community. We have the right to determine who shall be\r\nmembers of our community; and much as has been said here about what\r\nGod has done, and about our obligations to the Almighty in reference\r\nto this matter, I do not see where it comes in that we are bound to\r\nreceive into our community those whose minglings with us might be\r\ndetrimental to our interests. I do not believe that a superior race is\r\nbound to receive among it those of an inferior race, if the mingling\r\nof them can only tend to the detriment of the mass. I do not mean\r\nstrict miscegenation, but I mean the mingling of two races in society,\r\nassociating from time to time with each other.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania, spoke against the bill. He said: \"The\r\nidentical question came up in my State--the question whether the negro\r\nwas a citizen, and whether he possessed political power in that\r\nState--and it was there decided that he was not one of the original\r\ncorporators, that he was not one of the freemen who originally\r\npossessed political power, and that they had never, by any enactment\r\nor by any act of theirs, admitted him into a participation of that\r\npower, except so far as to tax him for the support of Government. And,\r\nMr. President, I think it a most important question, and particularly\r\na most important question for the Pacific coast, and those States\r\nwhich lie upon it, as to whether this door shall now be thrown open to\r\nthe Asiatic population. If it be, there is an end to republican\r\ngovernment there, because it is very well ascertained that those\r\npeople have no appreciation of that form of government; it seems to be\r\nobnoxious to their very nature; they seem to be incapable either of\r\nunderstanding it or of carrying it out; and I can not consent to say\r\nthat California, or Oregon, or Colorado, or Nevada, or any of those\r\nStates, shall be given over to an irruption of Chinese. I, for my\r\npart, protest against it.\r\n\r\n\"There is a great deal more in this bill that is exceedingly\r\nobjectionable. It is the first time, I think, in the history of\r\ncivilized legislation, that a judicial officer has been held up and\r\nsubjected to a criminal punishment for that which may have been a\r\nconscientious discharge of his duty. It is, I say, the first case that\r\nI know of, in the legislation of modern and civilized nations, where a\r\nbill of indictment is to take the place of a writ of error, and where\r\na mistake is to be tortured into a crime.\r\n\r\n\"I may state that I have another objection to this bill at the present\r\ntime; and that is, that the people of several States in the Union are\r\nnot represented here, and yet this law is mainly to operate upon those\r\npeople. I think it would be at least decent, respectful, if we desire\r\nto maintain and support this Government on the broad foundation upon\r\nwhich it was laid--namely, the consent of the governed--that we should\r\nwait, at any rate, until the people upon whom it is to operate have a\r\nvoice in these halls.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan then proceeded in a somewhat \"devious course,\" as it was\r\ncharacterized by another Senator, to make remarks upon the subject of\r\nreconstruction. Many questions and remarks were interposed by other\r\nSenators, giving the discussion an exceedingly colloquial style.\r\n\r\nAt length, Mr. Howard, of Michigan, having obtained the floor, spoke\r\nin favor of the bill. He said: \"If I understand correctly the\r\ninterpretation given by several Senators to the constitutional\r\namendment abolishing slavery, it is this: that the sole effect of it\r\nis to cut and sever the mere legal ligament by which the person and\r\nthe service of the slave was attached to his master, and that beyond\r\nthis particular office the amendment does not go; that it can have no\r\neffect whatever upon the condition of the emancipated black in any\r\nother respect. In other words, they hold that it relieves him from his\r\nso-called legal obligation to render his personal service to his\r\nmaster without compensation, and there leaves him, totally,\r\nirretrievably, and without any power on the part of Congress to look\r\nafter his well-being from the moment of this mockery of emancipation.\r\nSir, such was not the intention of the friends of this amendment at\r\nthe time of its initiation here, and at the time of its adoption; and\r\nI undertake to say that it is not the construction which is given to\r\nit by the bar throughout the country, and much less by the\r\nliberty-loving people.\r\n\r\n\"But let us look more closely at this narrow construction. Where does\r\nit leave us? We are told that the amendment simply relieves the slave\r\nfrom the obligation to render service to his master. What is a slave\r\nin contemplation of American law, in contemplation of the laws of all\r\nthe slave States? We know full well; the history of two hundred years\r\nteaches us that he had no rights, nor nothing which he could call his\r\nown. He had not the right to become a husband or a father in the eye\r\nof the law; he had no child; he was not at liberty to indulge the\r\nnatural affections of the human heart for children, for wife, or even\r\nfor friend. He owned no property, because the law prohibited him. He\r\ncould not take real or personal estate either by sale, by grant, or by\r\ndescent or inheritance. He did not own the bread he earned and ate. He\r\nstood upon the face of the earth completely isolated from the society\r\nin which he happened to be. He was nothing but a chattel, subject to\r\nthe will of his owner, and unprotected in his rights by the law of the\r\nState where he happened to live. His rights, did I say? No, sir, I use\r\ninappropriate language. He had no rights; he was an animal; he was\r\nproperty, a chattel. The Almighty, according to the ideas of the\r\ntimes, had made him to be property, a Chattel, and not a man.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, it is not denied that this relation of servitude between\r\nthe former negro slave and his master was actually severed by this\r\namendment. But the absurd construction now forced upon it leaves him\r\nwithout family, without property, without the implements of husbandry,\r\nand even without the right to acquire or use any instrumentalities of\r\ncarrying on the industry of which he may be capable; it leaves him\r\nwithout friend or support, and even without the clothes to cover his\r\nnakedness. He is a waif upon the current of time; he has nothing that\r\nbelongs to him on the face of the earth, except solely his naked\r\nperson. And here, in this State, we are called upon to abandon the\r\npoor creature whom we have emancipated. We are coolly told that he has\r\nno right beyond this, and we are told that under this amendment the\r\npower of the State within whose limits he happens to be is not at all\r\nrestrained in respect to him, and that the State, through its\r\nLegislature, may at any time declare him to be a vagrant, and as such\r\ncommit him to jail, or assign him to uncompensated service.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson, of Maryland, made a speech, in which he expressed himself\r\nas in favor of conferring citizenship upon the negro, and yet unable\r\nto vote for this bill from the opinion he entertained on \"the question\r\nof power.\" He referred to the Dred Scott and other decisions, and\r\nshowed their bearing upon the legislation now proposed. He said: \"I\r\nhave been exceedingly anxious individually that there should be some\r\ndefinition which will rid this class of our people from that\r\nobjection. If the Supreme Court decision is a binding one, and will be\r\nfollowed in the future, this law which we are now about to pass will\r\nbe held, of course, to be of no avail, as far as it professes to\r\ndefine what citizenship is, because it gives the rights of citizenship\r\nto all persons without distinction of color, and, of course, embraces\r\nAfricans or descendants of Africans.\"\r\n\r\nHe referred to a precedent when Congress had conferred the rights of\r\ncitizenship: \"The citizens of Texas, who, of course, were aliens, it\r\nhas never been doubted became citizens of the United States by the\r\nannexation of Texas; and that was not done by treaty, it was done by\r\nlegislation. If the power was in Congress by legislation to make\r\ncitizens of all the inhabitants of the State of Texas, why is it not\r\nin the power of Congress to make citizens by legislation of all who\r\nare inhabitants of the United States, and who are not citizens? That\r\nis what this bill does, or what it proposes to do. There are within\r\nthe United States millions of people who are not citizens, according\r\nto the view of the Supreme Court of the United States. Ought they to\r\nbe citizens? I think they ought. I think it is an anomaly that says\r\nthere shall not be the rights of citizenship to any of the inhabitants\r\nof any State of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"While they were slaves, it was a very different question; but now,\r\nwhen slavery is terminated, and by terminating it you have got rid of\r\nthe only obstacle in the way of citizenship, two questions arise:\r\nFirst, whether that fact itself does not make them citizens? Before\r\nthey were not citizens, because of slavery, and only because of\r\nslavery. Slavery abolished, why are they not just as much citizens as\r\nthey would have been if slavery had never existed? My opinion is that\r\nthey become citizens, and I hold that opinion so strongly that I\r\nshould consider it unnecessary to legislate on the subject at all, as\r\nfar as that class is concerned, but for the ruling of the Supreme\r\nCourt to which I have adverted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis, of Kentucky, spoke against the propriety and\r\nconstitutionality of making all negroes citizens of the United States.\r\nHe said: \"There never was a colony before the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and there never was a State after the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, up to the time of the adoption of the Constitution, so\r\nfar as I have been able to learn by the slight historical examination\r\nwhich I have given to the subject, that ever made or attempted to make\r\nany other person than a person who belonged to one of the\r\nnationalities of Europe a citizen. I invoke the chairman of the\r\ncommittee to give me an instance, to point to any history or any\r\nmemento, where a negro, although that negro was born in America, was\r\never made a citizen of either of the States of the United States\r\nbefore the adoption of this Constitution. The whole material out of\r\nwhich citizens were made previous to the adoption of the present\r\nConstitution was from the European nationalities, from the Caucasian\r\nrace, if I may use the term. I deny that a single citizen was ever\r\nmade by one of the States out of the negro race. I deny that a single\r\ncitizen was ever made by one of the States out of the Mongolian race.\r\nI controvert that a single citizen was ever made by one of the States\r\nout of the Chinese race, out of the Hindoos, or out of any other race\r\nof people but the Caucasian race of Europe.\r\n\r\n\"I come, then, to this position: that whenever the States, after the\r\nDeclaration of Independence and before the present Constitution was\r\nadopted, legislated in relation to citizenship, or acted in their\r\ngovernments in relation to citizenship, the subject of that\r\nlegislation or that action was the Caucasian race of Europe; that none\r\nof the inferior races of any kind were intended to be embraced or were\r\nembraced by this work of Government in manufacturing citizens.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull inquired, \"Will the Senator from Kentucky allow me to ask\r\nhim if he means to assert that negroes were not citizens of any of\r\nthese colonies before the adoption of the Constitution?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say they were not,\" said Mr. Davis.\r\n\r\n\"Does the Senator wish any authority to show that they were?\" asked\r\nMr. Trumbull.\r\n\r\n\"When I get through,\" said Mr. Davis, \"you can answer me.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull replied: \"I understood the Senator to challenge me to\r\nproduce any proof on that point, and I thought he would like to have\r\nit in his speech. I can assert to him that by a solemn decision of the\r\nSupreme Court of North Carolina, they were citizens before the\r\nadoption of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the honorable Senator will allow me,\" said Mr. Davis, \"I will get\r\nalong with my remarks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you will get along better,\" replied Mr. Trumbull, \"by not\r\nbeing exposed in your statements.\"\r\n\r\n\"The honorable Senator is full of conceit, but I have seen less\r\nconceit with a great deal more brains,\" said Mr. Davis, who then\r\nproceeded \"to throw up\" what he termed \"the main buttress for the\r\ndefense of the positions\" that he took.\r\n\r\n\"My main position,\" said he, \"is, that no native-born person of the\r\nUnited States, of any race or color, can be admitted a citizen of the\r\nUnited States by Congress under the power conferred in relation to\r\nnaturalization by the Constitution upon Congress.\"\r\n\r\nAfter reading some authorities, the Senator proceeded to say: \"A grave\r\nhallucination in this day is to claim all power; and a minor error is\r\nthat every thing which passion, or interest, or party power, or any\r\nselfish claims may represent to the judgment or imagination of\r\ngentlemen who belong to strong parties, to be necessary or useful for\r\nthe good and the domination of such parties, is seized upon in\r\ndefiance of a fair construction of language, in outrage of the plain\r\nmeaning of the Constitution. That is not the rule by which our\r\nConstitution is to be interpreted. It is not the rule by which it is\r\nto be administered. On the contrary, if the able, honorable, and\r\nclear-headed Senator from Illinois would do himself and his country\r\nthe justice to place himself in the position of the framers of the\r\nConstitution; if he would look all around on the circumstances and\r\nconnections of that day, on the purposes of those men not only in\r\nrelation to forming a more perfect Union, but also in relation to\r\nsecuring the blessings of life, liberty, and property to themselves\r\nand their posterity forever; if the honorable Senator would construe\r\nthe Constitution according to the light, the sacred and bright light\r\nwhich such surrounding circumstances would throw upon his intellect,\r\nit seems to me that he would at once abandon this abominable bill, and\r\nwould also ask to withdraw its twin sister from the other House that\r\nboth might be smothered here together upon the altar of the\r\nConstitution and of patriotism.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of Mr. Davis' speech, much debate and conversation ensued\r\namong various Senators upon a proposed amendment by Mr. Lane, of\r\nKansas, by which Indians \"under tribal authority\" should be excluded\r\nfrom the benefits conferred by this bill. After this question was\r\ndisposed of, Mr. Davis was drawn out in another speech by what seemed\r\nto him to be the necessity of defending some positions which he had\r\nassumed. He said:\r\n\r\n\"I still reiterate the position that the negro is not a citizen here\r\naccording to the essential fundamental principles of our system; but\r\nwhether he be a citizen or not, he is not a foreigner, and no man,\r\nwhite or black, or red or mixed, can be made a citizen by\r\nnaturalization unless he is a foreigner.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clark, of New Hampshire, interposed: \"I wish the Senator from\r\nKentucky would tell us what constitutes a citizen under the\r\nConstitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"A foreigner is not a citizen in the fullest sense of the word at\r\nall,\" said Mr. Davis.\r\n\r\n\"The Senator is now telling us,\" said Mr. Clark, \"who is not a\r\ncitizen, but my question is, What constitutes a citizen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I leave that to the exercise of your own ingenuity,\" replied Mr.\r\nDavis.\r\n\r\n\"That is it,\" said Mr. Clark. \"Washington is dead; Marshall is dead;\r\nStory is dead; I hoped the Senator from Kentucky would have\r\nenlightened us. He says a negro is not a citizen, and a negro is not a\r\nforeigner and can not be made a citizen. He says that a person who\r\nmight be and was a citizen before the Constitution, is not a citizen\r\nsince the Constitution was adopted. What right was taken away from him\r\nby the Constitution that disqualifies him from being a citizen? The\r\nfree negroes in my State, before the Constitution was adopted, were\r\ncitizens.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis, having admitted that free negroes were citizens before the\r\nConstitution in New Hampshire, Mr. Clark said:\r\n\r\n\"I desired that the Senator should tell me what, in his opinion,\r\nconstituted a citizen under the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis replied: \"I will answer the honorable Senator. We sometimes\r\nanswer a positive question by declaring what a thing is not. Now, the\r\nhonorable Senator asks me what a citizen is. It is easier to answer\r\nwhat it is not than what it is, and I say that a negro is not a\r\ncitizen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is a lucid definition,\" said Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\n\"Sufficient for the subject,\" said Mr. Davis.\r\n\r\n\"That is begging the question,\" Mr. Clark replied. \"I wanted to find\r\nwhy a negro was not a citizen, if the gentleman would tell me. If he\r\nwould lay down his definition, I wanted to see whether the negro did\r\nnot comply with it and conform to it, so as to be a citizen; but he\r\ninsists that he is not a citizen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will answer that question, if the honorable Senator will permit\r\nme,\" said Mr. Davis. \"Government is a political partnership. No\r\npersons but the partners who formed the partnership are parties to the\r\ngovernment. Here is a government formed by the white man alone. The\r\nnegro was excluded from the formation of our political partnership; he\r\nhad nothing to do with it; he had nothing to do in its formation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it a close corporation, so that new partners can not be added?\"\r\nasked Mr. Stewart, of Nevada.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Mr. Davis; \"it is a close white corporation. You may\r\nbring all of Europe, but none of Asia and none of Africa into our\r\npartnership.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see,\" said Mr. Clark, \"how that may be. Take the gentleman's\r\nown ground that government is a partnership, and those who did not\r\nenter into it and take an active part in it can not be citizens. Is a\r\nwoman a citizen under our Constitution?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to vote,\" said Mr. Davis.\r\n\r\n\"I did not ask about voting,\" said Mr. Clark. \"The gentleman said\r\nawhile ago that voting did not constitute citizenship. I want to know\r\nif she is a citizen. Can she not sue and be sued, contract, and\r\nexercise the rights of a citizen?\"\r\n\r\n\"So can a free negro,\" said Mr. Davis.\r\n\r\n\"Then, if a free negro can do all that,\" said Mr. Clark; \"why is he\r\nnot a citizen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he is no part of the governing power; that is the reason,\"\r\nMr. Davis replied.\r\n\r\n\"I deny that,\" said Mr. Clark, \"because in some of the States he is a\r\npart of the governing power. The Senator only begs the question; it\r\nonly comes back to this, that a nigger is a nigger.\" [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n\"That is the whole of it,\" said Mr. Davis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon. Reverdy Johnson.]\r\n\r\n\"That is the whole of the gentleman's logic,\" said Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the statement insisted on by Mr. Davis, \"You can not make\r\na citizen of any body that is not a foreigner,\" Mr. Johnson said:\r\n\r\n\"That would be an extraordinary condition for the country to be in.\r\nHere are four million negroes. They are not foreigners, because they\r\nwere born in the United States. They have no foreign allegiance to\r\nrenounce, because they owed no foreign allegiance. Their allegiance,\r\nwhatever it was, was an allegiance to the Government of the United\r\nStates alone. They can not come, therefore, under the naturalizing\r\nclause; they can not come, of course, under the statutes passed in\r\npursuance of the power conferred upon Congress by that clause; but\r\ndoes it follow from that that you can not make them citizens; that the\r\nCongress of the United States, vested with the whole legislative power\r\nbelonging to the Government, having within the limits of the United\r\nStates four million people anxious to become citizens, and when you\r\nare anxious to make them citizens, have no power to make them\r\ncitizens? It seems to me that to state the question is to answer it.\r\n\r\n\"The honorable member reads the Constitution as if it said that none\r\nbut white men should become citizens of the United States; but it says\r\nno such thing, and never intended, in my judgment, to say any such\r\nthing. If it had designed to exclude from all participation in the\r\nrights of citizenship certain men on account of color, and to have\r\nconfined, at all times thereafter, citizenship to the white race, it\r\nis but fair to presume, looking to the character of the men who framed\r\nthe Constitution, that they would have put that object beyond all\r\npossible doubt; they would have said that no man should be a citizen\r\nof the United States except a white man, or rather would have\r\nnegatived the right of the negro to become a citizen by saying that\r\nCongress might pass uniform rules upon the subject of the\r\nnaturalization of white immigrants and nobody else; but that they did\r\nnot do. They left it to Congress. Congress, in the exercise of their\r\ndiscretion, have thought proper to insert the term 'white' in the\r\nnaturalization act; but they may strike it out, and if it should be\r\nstricken out, I do not think any lawyer, except my friend from\r\nKentucky, would deny that a black man could be naturalized, and by\r\nnaturalization become a citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"But to go back to the point from which the questions of my honorable\r\nfriend from Kentucky caused me to digress, we have now within the\r\nUnited States four million colored people, the descendants of\r\nAfricans, whose ancestors were brought into the United States as\r\nchattels. It was because of that condition that they were considered\r\nas not entitled to the rights of citizenship. We have put an end to\r\nthat condition. We have said that at all times hereafter men of any\r\ncolor that nature may think proper to impress upon the human frame,\r\nshall, if within the United States, be free, and not property. Then,\r\nwe have four million colored people who are now as free as we are; and\r\nthe only question is, whether, being free, they can not be clothed\r\nwith the rights of citizenship. The honorable member from Kentucky\r\nsays no, because the naturalization clause does not include them. I\r\nhave attempted to answer that. He says no, because the act passed in\r\npursuance of that clause does not include them. I have answered that\r\nby saying that that act in that particular may be changed.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, February 1st, the discussion of the bill was\r\nresumed by Mr. Morrill, of Maine. He said of the bill: \"It marks an\r\nepoch in the history of this country, and from this time forward the\r\nlegislation takes a fresh and a new departure. Sir, to-day is the only\r\nhour since this Government began when it was possible to have enacted\r\nit. Such has been the situation of politics in this country, nay, sir,\r\nsuch have been the provisions of the fundamental law of this country,\r\nthat such legislation hitherto has never been possible. There has been\r\nno time since the foundation of the Government when an American\r\nCongress could by possibility have enacted such a law, or with\r\npropriety have made such a declaration. What is this declaration? All\r\npersons born in this country are citizens. That never was so before.\r\nAlthough I have said that by the fundamental principles of American\r\nlaw all persons were entitled to be citizens by birth, we all know\r\nthat there was an exceptional condition in the Government of the\r\ncountry which provided for an exception to this general rule. Here\r\nwere four million slaves in this country that were not citizens, not\r\ncitizens by the general policy of the country, not citizens on account\r\nof their condition of servitude; up to this hour they could not have\r\nbeen treated by us as citizens; so long as that provision in the\r\nConstitution which recognized this exceptional condition remained the\r\nfundamental law of the country, such a declaration as this would not\r\nhave been legal, could not have been enacted by Congress. I hail it,\r\ntherefore, as a declaration which typifies a grand fundamental change\r\nin the politics of the country, and which change justifies the\r\ndeclaration now.\r\n\r\n\"The honorable Senator from Kentucky has vexed himself somewhat, I\r\nthink, with the problem of the naturalization of American citizens. As\r\nhe reads it, only foreigners can be naturalized, or, in other words,\r\ncan become citizens; and upon his assumption, four million men and\r\nwomen in this country are outside not only of naturalization, not only\r\nof citizenship, but outside of the possibility of citizenship. Sir, he\r\nhas forgotten the grand principle both of nature and nations, both of\r\nlaw and politics, that birth gives citizenship of itself. This is the\r\nfundamental principle running through all modern politics both in this\r\ncountry and in Europe. Every-where, where the principles of law have\r\nbeen recognized at all, birth by its inherent energy and force gives\r\ncitizenship. Therefore the founders of this Government made no\r\nprovision--of course they made none--for the naturalization of\r\nnatural-born citizens. The Constitution speaks of 'natural-born,' and\r\nspeaks of them as citizens in contradistinction from those who are\r\nalien to us. Therefore, sir, this amendment, although it is a grand\r\nenunciation, although it is a lofty and sublime declaration, has no\r\nforce or efficiency as an enactment. I hail it and accept it simply as\r\na declaration.\r\n\r\n\"The honorable Senator from Kentucky, when he criticises the methods\r\nof naturalization, and rules out, for want of power, four million\r\npeople, forgets this general process of nations and of nature by which\r\nevery man, by his birth, is entitled to citizenship, and that upon the\r\ngeneral principle that he owes allegiance to the country of his birth,\r\nand that country owes him protection. That is the foundation, as I\r\nunderstand it, of all citizenship, and these are the essential\r\nelements of citizenship: allegiance on the one side, and protection on\r\nthe other.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to statements made by Mr. Davis, Mr. Morrill remarked: \"The\r\nSenator from Kentucky denounces as a usurpation this measure, and\r\nparticularly this amendment, this declaration. He says it is not\r\nwithin the principles of the Constitution. That it is extraordinary I\r\nadmit. That the measure is not ordinary is most clear. There is no\r\nparallel, I have already said, for it in the history of this country;\r\nthere is no parallel for it in the history of any country. No nation,\r\nfrom the foundation of government, has ever undertaken to make a\r\nlegislative declaration so broad. Why? Because no nation hitherto has\r\never cherished a liberty so universal. The ancient republics were all\r\nexceptional in their liberty; they all had excepted classes, subjected\r\nclasses, which were not the subject of government, and, therefore,\r\nthey could not so legislate. That it is extraordinary and without a\r\nparallel in the history of this Government, or of any other, does not\r\naffect the character of the declaration itself.\r\n\r\n\"The Senator from Kentucky tells us that the proposition is\r\nrevolutionary, and he thinks that is an objection. I freely concede\r\nthat it is revolutionary. I admit that this species of legislation is\r\nabsolutely revolutionary. But are we not in the midst of revolution?\r\nIs the Senator from Kentucky utterly oblivious to the grand results of\r\nfour years of war? Are we not in the midst of a civil and political\r\nrevolution which has changed the fundamental principles of our\r\nGovernment in some respects? Sir, is it no revolution that you have\r\nchanged the entire system of servitude in this country? Is it no\r\nrevolution that now you can no longer talk of two systems of\r\ncivilization in this country? Four short years back, I remember to\r\nhave listened to eloquent speeches in this chamber, in which we were\r\ntold that there was a grand antagonism in our institutions; that there\r\nwere two civilizations; that there was a civilization based on\r\nservitude, and that it was antagonistic to the free institutions of\r\nthe country. Where is that? Gone forever. That result is a revolution\r\ngrander and sublimer in its consequences than the world has witnessed\r\nhitherto.\r\n\r\n\"I accept, then, what the Senator from Kentucky thinks so obnoxious.\r\nWe are in the midst of revolution. We have revolutionized this\r\nConstitution of ours to that extent; and every substantial change in\r\nthe fundamental constitution of a country is a revolution. Why, sir,\r\nthe Constitution even provides for revolutionizing itself. Nay, more,\r\nit contemplates it; contemplates that in the changing phases of life,\r\ncivil and political, changes in the fundamental law will become\r\nnecessary; and is it needful for me to advert to the facts and events\r\nof the last four or five years to justify the declaration that\r\nrevolution here is not only radical and thorough, but the result of\r\nthe events of the last four years? Of course, I mean to contend in all\r\nI say that the revolution of which I speak should be peaceful, as on\r\nthe part of the Government here it has been peaceful. It grows out, to\r\nbe sure, of an assault upon our institutions by those whose purpose it\r\nwas to overthrow the Government; but, on the part of the Government,\r\nit has been peaceful, it has been within the forms of the\r\nConstitution; but it is a revolution nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\"But the honorable Senator from Kentucky insists that it is a\r\nusurpation. Not so, sir. Although it is a revolution radical, as I\r\ncontend, it was not a usurpation. It was not a usurpation, because it\r\ntook place within the provisions contemplated in the Constitution.\r\nMore than that, it was a change precisely in harmony with the general\r\nprinciples of the Government. This great change which has been wrought\r\nin our institutions was in harmony with the fundamental principles of\r\nthe Government. The change which has been made has destroyed that\r\nwhich was exceptional in our institutions; and the action of the\r\nGovernment in regard to it was provoked by the enemies of the\r\nGovernment. The opportunity was afforded, and the change which has\r\nbeen wrought was in harmony with the fundamental principles of the\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Maine opposed the theory that this is a Government\r\nexclusively for white men. He remarked: \"It is said that this\r\namendment raises the general question of the antagonism of the races,\r\nwhich, we are told, is a well-established fact. It is said that no\r\nrational man, no intelligent legislator or statesman, should ever act\r\nwithout reference to that grand historical fact; and the Senator from\r\nPennsylvania, [Mr. Cowan,] on a former occasion, asserted that this\r\nGovernment, that American society, had been established here upon the\r\nprinciple of the exclusion, as he termed it, of the inferior and the\r\nbarbarian races. Mr. President, I deny that proposition as a\r\nhistorical fact. There is nothing more inaccurate. No proposition\r\ncould possibly be made here or anywhere else more inaccurate than to\r\nsay that American society, either civil or political, was formed in\r\nthe interest of any race or class. Sir, the history of the country\r\ndoes not bear out the statement of the honorable Senator from\r\nPennsylvania. Was not America said to be the land of refuge? Has it\r\nnot been, since the earliest period, held up as an asylum for the\r\noppressed of all nations? Hither, allow me to ask, have not all the\r\npeoples of the nations of the earth come for an asylum and for refuge?\r\nAll the nations of the earth, and all the varieties of the races of\r\nthe nations of the earth, have gathered here. In the early settlements\r\nof the country, the Irish, the French, the Swede, the Turk, the\r\nItalian, the Moor, and so I might enumerate all the races, and all the\r\nvariety of races, came here; and it is a fundamental mistake to\r\nsuppose that settlement was begun here in the interests of any class,\r\nor condition, or race, or interest. This Western Continent was looked\r\nto as an asylum for the oppressed of all nations and of all races.\r\nHither all nations and all races have come. Here, sir, upon the grand\r\nplane of republican democratic liberty, they have undertaken to work\r\nout the great problem of man's capacity for self-government without\r\nstint or limit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis then made another speech in opposition to the bill. When the\r\nhour for adjournment had arrived, and Mr. Johnson interrupted him with\r\na proposition that \"the bill be passed over for to-day,\" Mr. Davis\r\nsaid, \"I am wound up, and am obliged to run down.\" The Senate,\r\nhowever, adjourned at a late hour, and resumed the hearing of Mr.\r\nDavis on the following day.\r\n\r\nIn alluding to Mr. Johnson's strictures on his assertion that Congress\r\nhad no power to confer the right of citizenship on \"the native born\r\nnegro,\" Mr. Davis said: \"The honorable Senator, [Mr. Johnson,] as I\r\nsaid the other day, is one of the ablest lawyers, and, I believe, the\r\nablest living lawyer in the land. I have seen gentlemen sometimes so\r\nmuch the lawyer that they had to abate some of the statesman\r\n[laughter]; and I am not certain, I would not say it was so--I will\r\nnot arrogate to myself to say so--but sometimes a suspicion flashes\r\nacross my mind that that is precisely the predicament of my honorable\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\"I maintain that a negro can not be made a citizen by Congress; he can\r\nnot be made a citizen by any naturalization laws, because the\r\nnaturalization laws apply to foreigners alone. No man can shake the\r\nlegal truth of that position. They apply to foreigners alone; and a\r\nnegro, an Indian, or any other person born within the United States,\r\nnot being a foreigner, can not be naturalized; therefore they can not\r\nbe made citizens by the uniform rule established by Congress under the\r\nConstitution, and there is no other rule. Congress has no power, as I\r\nsaid before, to naturalize a citizen. They could not be made citizens\r\nby treaty. If they are made so at all, it is by their birth, and the\r\nlocality of their birth, and the general operation and effect of our\r\nConstitution. If they are so made citizens, that question is a\r\njudicial question, not a legislative question. Congress has no power\r\nto enlarge or extend any of the provisions of the Constitution which\r\nbear upon the birth or citizenship of negroes or Indians born in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"If there was any despot in Europe or in the world that wanted a\r\nmaster architect in framing and putting together a despotic and\r\noppressive law, I would, if my slight voice could reach him, by all\r\nmeans say to him, Seek the laboratory of the Senator from Illinois. If\r\nhe has not proved himself an adept in this kind of legislation,\r\nunconstitutional, unjust, oppressive, iniquitous, unwise, impolitic,\r\ncalculated to keep forever a severance of the Union, to exclude from\r\nall their constitutional rights, privileges, and powers under the\r\nGovernment eleven States of the Union--if he has not devised such a\r\nmeasure as that, I have not reason enough to comprehend it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis closed his speech by saying: \"Was it for these fruits and\r\nthese laws that we went into this war? Was it for these fruits and\r\nthese laws and these oppressions that two million and a quarter of men\r\nwere ordered into the field? Was it that the American people might\r\nenjoy these as the fruits of the triumphant close of this war, that\r\nhundreds of thousands of them have been mutilated on the battle-field\r\nand by the diseases of the camp, and that a debt of four or five\r\nthousand million dollars has been left upon the country? If these are\r\nto be the results of the war, better that not a single man had been\r\nmarshaled in the field nor a single star worn by one of our officers.\r\nThese military gentlemen think they have a right to command and\r\ncontrol every-where. They do it. They think they have a right to do it\r\nhere, and we are sheep in the hands of our shearers. We are dumb.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull said: \"I will occupy a few moments of the attention of\r\nthe Senate, after this long harangue of the Senator from Kentucky,\r\nwhich he closed by declaring that we are dumb in the presence of\r\nmilitary power. If he has satisfied the Senate that he is dumb, I\r\npresume he has satisfied the Senate of all the other positions he has\r\ntaken; and the others are about as absurd as that declaration. He\r\ndenounces this bill as 'outrageous,' 'most monstrous,' 'abominable,'\r\n'oppressive,' 'iniquitous,' 'unconstitutional,' 'void.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, what is this bill that is obnoxious to such terrible epithets?\r\nIt is a bill providing that all people shall have equal rights. Is not\r\nthat abominable? Is not that iniquitous? Is not that monstrous? Is not\r\nthat terrible on white men? [Laughter.] When was such legislation as\r\nthis ever thought of for white men?\r\n\r\n\"Sir, this bill applies to white men as well as black men. It declares\r\nthat all men in the United States shall be entitled to the same civil\r\nrights, the right to the fruit of their own labor, the right to make\r\ncontracts, the right to buy and sell, and enjoy liberty and happiness;\r\nand that is abominable and iniquitous and unconstitutional! Could any\r\nthing be more monstrous or more abominable than for a member of the\r\nSenate to rise in his place and denounce with such epithets as these a\r\nbill, the only object of which is to secure equal rights to all the\r\ncitizens of the country--a bill that protects a white man just as much\r\nas a black man? With what consistency and with what face can a Senator\r\nin his place here say to the Senate and the country, that this is a\r\nbill for the benefit of the black men exclusively, when there is no\r\nsuch distinction in it, and when the very object of the bill is to\r\nbreak down all discrimination between black men and white men?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Guthrie, of Kentucky, said: \"My doctrine is that slavery exists no\r\nlonger in this country; that it is impossible to exist in the face of\r\nthat provision; and with slavery fell the laws of all the States\r\nproviding for slavery, every one of them. I do not see what benefit\r\ncan arise from repealing them by this bill, because, if they are not\r\nrepealed by the Constitution as amended, this bill could not repeal\r\nthem. I hope that all the States in which slavery formerly existed\r\nwill accept that constitutional provision in good faith. I myself\r\naccept it in good faith. Believing that all the laws authorizing\r\nslavery have fallen, I have advised the people of Kentucky, and I\r\nwould advise all the States, to put these Africans upon the same\r\nfooting that the whites are in relation to civil rights. They have all\r\nthe rights that were formerly accorded to the free colored population\r\nin all the States just as fully this day as they will have after this\r\nbill has passed, and they will continue to have them.\r\n\r\n\"Now, to the States belong the government of their own population, and\r\nthose within their borders, upon all subjects. We, in Kentucky,\r\nprescribe punishment for those who violate the laws; we prescribe it\r\nfor the white population; we prescribe it for the free African\r\npopulation, and we prescribe it for the slave population. All the laws\r\nprescribing punishment for slaves fell with slavery, and they were\r\nsubject afterward only to the penalties which were inflicted upon the\r\nfree colored population, they then being free. Slaves, for many\r\noffenses, were punished far less than the free colored people. No\r\nslave was sent to the penitentiary and punished for stealing, or any\r\nthing of that kind, whereas a free person was. But all these States\r\nwill now, of course, remodel their laws upon the subject of offenses.\r\nI would advise that there should be but one code for all persons,\r\nblack as well as white; that there shall be one general rule for the\r\npunishment of crime in the different States. But, sir, the States must\r\nhave time to act on the subject; and yet we are here preparing laws\r\nand penalties, and proposing to carry them into execution by military\r\nauthority, before the States have had time to legislate, and even\r\nbefore some of their Legislatures have had time to convene.\r\n\r\n\"Kentucky has had her share of talking here, and, sir, she has had her\r\nshare of suffering during the war. At one time she was invaded by\r\nthree armies of the rebellion; all but seven or eight counties of the\r\nState, at one time, were occupied by its armies, and her whole\r\nterritory devastated by guerrillas. We have suffered in this war. We\r\nhave borne it as best we could. We feel it intensely that now, at the\r\nend of the war, we should be subjected to a military despotism, our\r\nhouses liable to be entered at any time when our families are at rest,\r\nby military men who can arrest and send to prison without warrant, and\r\nwe are obliged to go, and we are obliged to pay any fines they may\r\nimpose. I do not believe that you will lose any thing if you pause\r\nbefore passing such legislation as this, and establishing these\r\nmilitary despotisms, for we do not know where they are to end.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hendricks, of Indiana, had proposed to strike out the last clause\r\nof the bill, which provided that \"such part of the land and naval\r\nforces of the United States, or of the militia,\" as should be\r\nnecessary, might be employed to prevent the violation, and enforce the\r\ndue execution of this act. The Senator from Indiana opposed the bill\r\non the ground that it employed the machinery of the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw, and that it was to be enforced by the military authority of the\r\nUnited States. He said:\r\n\r\n\"This bill is a wasp; its sting is in its tail. Sir, what is this\r\nbill? It provides, in the first place, that the civil rights of all\r\nmen, without regard to color, shall be equal; and, in the second\r\nplace, that if any man shall violate that principle by his conduct, he\r\nshall be responsible to the court; that he may be prosecuted\r\ncriminally and punished for the crime, or he may be sued in a civil\r\naction and damages recovered by the party wronged. Is not that broad\r\nenough? Do Senators want to go further than this? To recognize the\r\ncivil rights of the colored people as equal to the civil rights of the\r\nwhite people, I understand to be as far as Senators desire to go; in\r\nthe language of the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Sumner], to place\r\nall men upon an equality before the law; and that is proposed in\r\nregard to their civil rights.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to the reënactment of the odious features of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law in this bill, Mr. Hendricks said: \"I recollect how the blood\r\nof the people was made to run cold within them when it was said that\r\nthe white man was required to run after the fugitive slave; that the\r\nlaw of 1850 made you and me, my brother Senators, slave-catchers; that\r\nthe _posse comitatus_ could be called to execute a writ of the law,\r\nfor the recovery of a runaway slave, under the provisions of the\r\nConstitution of the United States; and the whole country was agitated\r\nbecause of it. Now slavery is gone; the negro is to be established\r\nupon a platform of civil equality with the white man. That is the\r\nproposition. But we do not stop there; we are to reënact a law that\r\nnearly all of you said was wicked and wrong; and for what purpose? Not\r\nto pursue the negro any longer; not for the purpose of catching him;\r\nnot for the purpose of catching the great criminals of the land; but\r\nfor the purpose of placing it in the power of any deputy marshal in\r\nany county of the country to call upon you and me, and all the body of\r\nthe people, to pursue some white man who is running for his liberty,\r\nbecause some negro has charged him with denying to him equal civil\r\nrights with the white man. I thought, sir, that that frame-work was\r\nenough; I thought, when you placed under the command of the marshal,\r\nin every county of the land, all the body of the people, and put every\r\none upon the track of the fleeing white man, that that was enough; but\r\nit is not. For the purpose of the enforcement of this law, the\r\nPresident is authorized to appoint somebody who is to have the command\r\nof the military and naval forces of the United States--for what\r\npurpose? To prevent a violation of this law, and to execute it.\r\n\r\n\"You clothe the marshals under this bill with all the powers that were\r\ngiven to the marshals under the Fugitive Slave Law. That was regarded\r\nas too arbitrary in its provisions, and you repealed it. You said it\r\nshould not stand upon the statute-book any longer; that no man, white\r\nor black, should be pursued under the provisions of that law. Now, you\r\nreënact it, and you claim it as a merit and an ornament to the\r\nlegislation of the country; and you add an army of officers and clothe\r\nthem with the power to call upon any body and every body to pursue the\r\nrunning white man. That is not enough, but you must have the military\r\nto be called in, at the pleasure of whom? Such a person as the\r\nPresident may authorize to call out the military forces. Where it\r\nshall be, and to whom this power shall be given, we do not know.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lane, of Indiana, replied to the argument of his colleague. He\r\nsaid: \"It is true that many of the provisions of this bill, changed in\r\ntheir purpose and object, are almost identical with the provisions of\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law, and they are denounced by my colleague in\r\ntheir present application; but I have not heard any denunciation from\r\nmy colleague, or from any of those associated with him, of the\r\nprovisions of that Fugitive Slave Law which was enacted in the\r\ninterest of slavery, and for purposes of oppression, and which was an\r\nunworthy, cowardly, disgraceful concession to Southern opinion by\r\nNorthern politicians. I have suffered no suitable opportunity to\r\nescape me to denounce the monstrous character of that Fugitive Slave\r\nAct of 1850. All these provisions were odious and disgraceful in my\r\nopinion, when applied in the interest of slavery, when the object was\r\nto strike down the rights of man. But here the purpose is changed.\r\nThese provisions are in the interest of freemen and of freedom, and\r\nwhat was odious in the one case becomes highly meritorious in the\r\nother. It is an instance of poetic justice and of apt retribution that\r\nGod has caused the wrath of man to praise Him. I stand by every\r\nprovision of this bill, drawn as it is from that most iniquitous\r\nfountain, the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.\r\n\r\n\"Then my colleague asks, Why do you invoke the power of the military\r\nto enforce these laws? And he says that constables, and sheriffs, and\r\nmarshals, when they have process to serve, have a right to call upon\r\nthe _posse comitatus_, the body of the whole people, to enforce their\r\nwrits. Here is a justice of the peace in South Carolina or Georgia, or\r\na county court, or a circuit court, that is called upon to execute\r\nthis law. They appoint their own marshal, their deputy marshal, or\r\ntheir constable, and he calls upon the _posse comitatus_. Neither the\r\njudge, nor the jury, nor the officer, as we believe, is willing to\r\nexecute the law. He may call upon the people, the body of the whole\r\npeople, a body of rebels steeped in treason and rebellion to their\r\nlips, and they are to execute it; and the gentleman seems wonderfully\r\nastonished that we should call upon the military power. We should not\r\nlegislate at all if we believed the State courts could or would\r\nhonestly carry out the provisions of the constitutional amendment; but\r\nbecause we believe they will not do that, we give the Federal officers\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\"But what harm is to result from it? Who is to be oppressed? What\r\nwhite man fleeing, in the language of my colleague, pursued by these\r\nharpies of the law, is in danger of having his rights stricken down?\r\nWhat does the bill provide? It places all men upon an equality, and\r\nunless the white man violates the law, he is in no danger. It takes no\r\nrights from any white man. It simply places others on the same\r\nplatform upon which he stands; and if he would invoke the power of\r\nlocal prejudice to override the laws of the country, this is no\r\nGovernment unless the military may be called in to enforce the order\r\nof the civil courts and obedience to the laws of the country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, said, in answer to some objections to\r\nthe bill urged by Mr. Guthrie: \"The Senator tells us that the\r\nemancipated men ought to have their civil rights, that the black codes\r\nfell with slavery; but the Senator forgets that at least six of the\r\nreörganized States in their new Legislatures have passed laws wholly\r\nincompatible with the freedom of these freedmen; and so atrocious are\r\nthe provisions of these laws, and so persistently are they carried\r\ninto effect by the local authorities, that General Thomas, in\r\nMississippi, General Swayne, in Alabama, General Sickles, in South\r\nCarolina, and General Terry, in Virginia, have issued positive orders,\r\nforbidding the execution of the black laws that have just been passed.\r\n\r\n\"So unjust, so wicked, so incompatible are these new black laws of the\r\nrebel States, made in defiance of the expressed will of the nation,\r\nthat Lieutenant-general Grant has been forced to issue that order,\r\nwhich sets aside the black laws of all these rebellious States against\r\nthe freedmen, and allows no law to be enforced against them that is\r\nnot enforced equally against white men. This order, issued by General\r\nGrant, will be respected, obeyed, and enforced in the rebel States\r\nwith the military power of the nation. Southern legislators and people\r\nmust learn, if they are compelled to learn by the bayonets of the Army\r\nof the United States, that the civil rights of the freedmen must be\r\nand shall be respected; that these freedmen are as free as their late\r\nmasters; that they shall live under the same laws, be tried for their\r\nviolation in the same manner, and if found guilty, punished in the\r\nsame manner and degree.\r\n\r\n\"This measure is called for, because these reconstructed Legislatures,\r\nin defiance of the rights of the freedmen, and the will of the nation,\r\nembodied in the amendment to the Constitution, have enacted laws\r\nnearly as iniquitous as the old slave codes that darkened the\r\nlegislation of other days. The needs of more than four million colored\r\nmen imperatively call for its enactment. The Constitution authorizes\r\nand the national will demands it. By a series of legislative acts, by\r\nexecutive proclamations, by military orders, and by the adoption of\r\nthe amendment to the Constitution by the people of the United States,\r\nthe gigantic system of human slavery that darkened the land,\r\ncontrolled the policy, and swayed the destinies of the republic has\r\nforever perished. Step by step we have marched right on from one\r\nvictory to another, with the music of broken fetters ringing in our\r\nears. None of the series of acts in this beneficent legislation of\r\nCongress, none of the proclamations of the Executive, none of these\r\nmilitary orders, protecting rights secured by law, will ever be\r\nrevoked or amended by the voice of the American people. There is now\r\n\r\n  \"'No slave beneath that starry flag,\r\n    The emblem of the free.'\r\n\r\n\"By the will of the nation freedom and free institutions for all,\r\nchains and fetters for none, are forever incorporated in the\r\nfundamental law of regenerated and united America. Slave codes and\r\nauction blocks, chains and fetters and blood-hounds, are things of the\r\npast, and the chattel stands forth a man, with the rights and the\r\npowers of the freemen. For the better security of these new-born civil\r\nrights we are now about to pass the greatest and the grandest act in\r\nthis series of acts that have emancipated a race and disinthralled a\r\nnation. It will pass, it will go upon the statute-book of the republic\r\nby the voice of the American people, and there it will remain. From\r\nthe verdict of Congress in favor of this great measure, no appeal will\r\never be entertained by the people of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan spoke again, and denounced the section of the bill which\r\nprovided for its enforcement by the military. He said: \"There it is;\r\nwords can not make it plainer; reason can not elucidate it; no\r\nlanguage can strengthen it or weaken it, one way or the other. There\r\nis the question whether a military man, educated in a military school,\r\naccustomed to supreme command, unaccustomed to the administration of\r\ncivil law among a free people, is to be intrusted with these appellate\r\njurisdiction over the courts of the country; whether he can in any\r\nway, whether he ought in any way, to be intrusted with such a power.\r\nI, for my part, will never agree to it; and I should feel myself\r\nrecreant to every duty that I owed to myself, to my country, to my\r\ncountry's history, and I may say to the race which has been for\r\nhundreds and thousands of years endeavoring to attain to something\r\nlike constitutional liberty, if I did not resist this and all similar\r\nprojects.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull answered some objections to the bill. \"The Senator from\r\nIndiana [Mr. Hendricks] objects to the bill because he says that the\r\nsame provisions which were enacted in the old Fugitive Slave Law are\r\nincorporated into this, and that it has been heralded to the country\r\nthat it was a great achievement to do this; and he insists that if\r\nthose provisions of law were odious and wicked and wrong which\r\nprovided for punishing men for aiding the slave to escape, therefore\r\nthey must be wicked and wrong now when they are employed for the\r\npunishing a man who undertakes to put a person into slavery. Sir, that\r\ndoes not follow at all. A law may be iniquitous and unjust and wrong\r\nwhich undertakes to punish another for doing an innocent act, which\r\nwould be righteous and just and proper to punish a man for doing a\r\nwicked act. We have upon our statute-books a law punishing a man who\r\ncommits murder, because the commission of murder is a high crime, and\r\nthe party who does it forfeits his right to live; but would it be just\r\nto apply the law which punishes a person for committing murder to an\r\ninnocent person who had killed another accidentally, without malice?\r\nThat is the difference. It is the difference between right and wrong,\r\nbetween good and evil. True, the features of the Fugitive Slave Law\r\nwere abominable when they were used for the purpose of punishing, not\r\nnegroes, as the Senator from Indiana says, but white men. The Fugitive\r\nSlave Law was enacted for the purpose of punishing white men who aided\r\nto give the natural gift of liberty to those who were enslaved. Now,\r\nsir, we propose to use the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Law for\r\nthe purpose of punishing those who deny freedom, not those who seek to\r\naid persons to escape to freedom. The difference was too clearly\r\npointed out by the colleague of the Senator [Mr. Lane] to justify me\r\nin taking further time in alluding to it.\r\n\r\n\"But the Senator objects to this bill because it authorizes the\r\ncalling in of the military; and he asserts that it is the only law in\r\nwhich the military is brought in to enforce it. The Senator from\r\nPennsylvania [Mr. Cowan] follows this up with a half hour's speech,\r\ndenouncing this law as obnoxious to the objection that it is a\r\nmilitary law, that it is taking the trial of persons for offenses out\r\nof the hands of the courts and placing them under the military--a\r\nmonstrous proposition, he says. Is that so? What is the law?\r\n\r\n\"It is a court bill; it is to be executed through the courts, and in\r\nno other way. But does the Senator mean to say it is a military bill\r\nbecause the military may be called in, in aid of the execution of the\r\nlaw through the courts? Does the Senator from Pennsylvania--I should\r\nlike his attention, and that of the Senator from Indiana, too--deny\r\nthe authority to call in the military in aid of the execution of the\r\nlaw through the courts?\r\n\r\n\"Let me read a clause from the Constitution, which seems to have been\r\nforgotten by the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from\r\nIndiana. The Senator from Pennsylvania, who has denounced this law,\r\nhas been living under just such a law for thirty years, and it seems\r\nnever found it out. What says the Constitution? 'Congress shall have\r\npower to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of\r\nthe Union.'\r\n\r\n\"Then, can not the militia prevent persons from violating the law?\r\nThey are authorized by the Constitution to be called out for, the\r\npurpose of executing the law, and here we have a law that is to be\r\ncarried into execution, and when you find persons combined together to\r\nprevent its execution, you can not do any thing with them! Suppose\r\nthat the county authorities in Muscogee County, Georgia, combine\r\ntogether to deny civil rights to every colored man in that county.\r\nFor the purpose of preventing it, before they have done any act, I say\r\nthe militia may be called out to prevent them from committing an act.\r\nWe are not required to wait until the act is committed before any\r\nthing can be done. That was the doctrine which led to this rebellion,\r\nthat we had no authority to do any thing till the conflict of arms\r\ncame. I believed then, in 1860, that we had authority; and if it had\r\nbeen properly exercised, if the men who were threatening rebellion,\r\nwho were in this chamber defying the authority of the Government, had\r\nbeen arrested for treason--of which, in my judgment, by setting on\r\nfoot armed expeditions against the country, they were guilty--and if\r\nthey had been tried and punished and executed for the crime, I doubt\r\nwhether this great rebellion would ever have taken place.\r\n\r\n\"There is another statute to which I beg leave to call the attention\r\nof the Senator from Pennsylvania, and under which he has lived for\r\nthirty years without ever having known it; and his rights have been\r\nfully protected. I wish to call attention to a section from which the\r\ntenth section of the bill under consideration, at which the Senator\r\nfrom Indiana is so horrified, is copied word for word, and letter for\r\nletter. The act of March 10, 1836, 'supplementary to an act entitled\r\n\"An act in addition to the act for the punishment of certain crimes\r\nagainst the United States, and to repeal the acts therein mentioned,\"\r\napproved 20th of April, 1818,' contains the very section that is in\r\nthis bill, word for word. It did not horrify the country; it did not\r\ndestroy all the liberties of the people; it did not consolidate all\r\nthe powers of the Constitution in the Federal Government; it did not\r\noverthrow the courts, and it has existed now for thirty years!\"\r\n\r\nThe question was first taken on the amendment offered by Mr.\r\nHendricks, to strike out the tenth section of the bill. The vote\r\nresulted yeas, twelve; nays, thirty-four.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the proceedings, Mr. Saulsbury moved to amend the\r\nbill by adding in the first section of the bill after the words \"civil\r\nrights,\" the words, \"except the right to vote in the States.\" He\r\ndesired that if the Senate did not wish to confer the right of\r\nsuffrage by this bill, they should say so. The question being taken on\r\nMr. Saulsbury's amendment, the vote resulted seven in the affirmative\r\nand thirty-nine in the negative.\r\n\r\nThe vote was finally taken on the passage of the bill, which resulted\r\nthirty-three in the affirmative and twelve in the negative. The\r\nfollowing Senators voted in favor of the bill:\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Anthony, Brown, Chandler, Clark, Connor, Cragin,\r\n     Dixon, Fessenden, Foot, Foster, Harris, Henderson, Howard,\r\n     Howe, Kirkwood, Henry S. Lane, James H.

Buckalew, Cowan, Davis, Guthrie, Hendricks,\r\n     McDougall, Nesmith, Norton, Riddle, Saulsbury, Stockton, and\r\n     Van Winkle--12.\r\n\r\nFive Senators were absent, to wit:\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Creswell, Doolittle, Grimes, Johnson, and Wright--5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\n     The Bill referred to the Judiciary Committee and reported\r\n     back -- Speech by the Chairman of the Committee -- Mr.\r\n     Rogers -- Mr. Cook -- Mr. Thayer -- Mr. Eldridge -- Mr.\r\n     Thornton -- Mr. Windom -- Mr. Shellabarger -- Mr. Broomall\r\n     -- Mr. Raymond -- Mr. Delano -- Mr. Kerr -- Amendment by Mr.\r\n     Bingham -- His Speech -- Reply by his Colleague --\r\n     Discussion closed by Mr. Wilson -- Yeas and Nays on the\r\n     Passage of the Bill -- Mr. Le Blond's proposed title --\r\n     Amendments of the House accepted by the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of February, four days after the passage of the Civil Rights\r\nBill in the Senate, it came before the House of Representatives, and\r\nhaving been read a first and second time, was referred to the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary. On the 1st of March, the Chairman of the\r\nJudiciary Committee, Mr. Wilson, brought the bill again before the\r\nHouse, proposing some verbal amendments which were adopted. He then\r\nmade a motion to recommit the bill, pending which, he made a speech on\r\nthe merits of the measure. He referred to many definitions, judicial\r\ndecisions, opinions, and precedents, under which negroes were entitled\r\nto the rights of American citizenship. In reference to the results of\r\nhis researches, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Precedents, both judicial and legislative, are found in sharp\r\nconflict concerning them. The line which divides these precedents is\r\ngenerally found to be the same which separates the early from the\r\nlater days of the republic. The further the Government drifted from\r\nthe old moorings of equality and human rights, the more numerous\r\nbecame judicial and legislative utterances in conflict with some of\r\nthe leading features of this bill.\"\r\n\r\nHe argued that the section of the bill providing for its enforcement\r\nby the military arm was necessary, in order \"to fortify the\r\ndeclaratory portions of this bill with such sanctions as will render\r\nit effective.\" In conclusion he said:\r\n\r\n\"Can not protection be rendered to the citizen in the mode prescribed\r\nby the measure we now have under consideration? If not, a perpetual\r\nstate of constructive war would be a great blessing to very many\r\nAmerican citizens. If a suspension of martial law and a restoration of\r\nthe ordinary forms of civil law are to result in a subjection of our\r\npeople to the outrages under the operation of State laws and municipal\r\nordinances which these orders now prevent, then it were better to\r\ncontinue the present state of affairs forever. But such is not the\r\ncase; we may provide by law for the same ample protection through the\r\ncivil courts that now depends on the orders of our military\r\ncommanders; and I will never consent to any other construction of our\r\nConstitution, for that would be the elevation of the military above\r\nthe civil power.\r\n\r\n\"Before our Constitution was formed, the great fundamental rights\r\nwhich I have mentioned belonged to every person who became a member of\r\nour great national family. No one surrendered a jot or tittle of these\r\nrights by consenting to the formation of the Government. The entire\r\nmachinery of Government, as organized by the Constitution, was\r\ndesigned, among other things, to secure a more perfect enjoyment of\r\nthese rights. A legislative department was created, that laws\r\nnecessary and proper to this end might be enacted; a judicial\r\ndepartment was erected to expound and administer the laws; an\r\nexecutive department was formed for the purpose of enforcing and\r\nseeing to the execution of these laws; and these several departments\r\nof Government possess the power to enact, administer, and enforce the\r\nlaws 'necessary and proper' to secure those rights which existed\r\nanterior to the ordination of the Constitution. Any other view of the\r\npowers of this Government dwarfs it, and renders it a failure in its\r\nmost important office.\r\n\r\n\"Upon this broad principle I rest my justification of this bill. I\r\nassert that we possess the power to do those things which governments\r\nare organized to do; that we may protect a citizen of the United\r\nStates against a violation of his rights by the law of a single State;\r\nthat by our laws and our courts we may intervene to maintain the proud\r\ncharacter of American citizenship; that this power permeates our whole\r\nsystem, is a part of it, without which the States can run riot over\r\nevery fundamental right belonging to citizens of the United States;\r\nthat the right to exercise this power depends upon no express\r\ndelegation, but runs with the rights it is designed to protect; that\r\nwe possess the same latitude in respect to the selection of means\r\nthrough which to exercise this power that belongs to us when a power\r\nrests upon express delegation; and that the decisions which support\r\nthe latter maintain the former. And here, sir, I leave the bill to the\r\nconsideration of the House.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers, of New Jersey, followed with an argument against the bill,\r\nbecause it interfered with \"States' Rights.\" Under its provisions,\r\nCongress would \"enter the domain of a State and interfere with its\r\ninternal police, statutes, and domestic regulations.\" He said:\r\n\r\n\"This act of legislation would destroy the foundations of the\r\nGovernment as they were laid and established by our fathers, who\r\nreserved to the States certain privileges and immunities which ought\r\nsacredly to be preserved to them.\r\n\r\n\"If you had attempted to do it in the days of those who were living at\r\nthe time the Constitution was made, after the birth of that noble\r\ninstrument, the spirit of the heroes of the Revolution and the ghosts\r\nof the departed who laid down their lives in defense of the liberty of\r\nthis country and of the rights of the States, would have come forth as\r\nwitnesses against the deadly infliction, and the destruction of the\r\nfundamental principle of the sovereignty of the States in violation of\r\nthe Constitution, and the breaking down of the ties that bind the\r\nStates, and the violation of the rights and liberties of the white men\r\nand white women of America.\r\n\r\n\"If you pass this bill, you will allow the negroes of this country to\r\ncompete for the high office of President of the United States. Because\r\nif they are citizens at all, they come within the meaning and letter\r\nof the Constitution of the United States, which allows all\r\nnatural-born citizens to become candidates for the Presidency, and to\r\nexercise the duties of that office if elected.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid of degrading this Government; I am afraid of danger to\r\nconstitutional liberty; I am alarmed at the stupendous strides which\r\nthis Congress is trying to initiate; and I appeal in behalf of my\r\ncountry, in behalf of those that are to come after us, of generations\r\nyet unborn, as well as those now living, that conservative men on the\r\nother side should rally to the standard of sovereign and independent\r\nStates, and blot out this idea which is inculcating itself here, that\r\nall the powers of the States must be taken away, and the power of the\r\nCzar of Russia or the Emperor of France must be lodged in the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\"I ask you to stand by the law of the country, and to regulate these\r\nFederal and State systems upon the grand principles upon which they\r\nwere intended to be regulated, that we may hand down to those who are\r\nto come after us this bright jewel of civil liberty unimpaired; and I\r\nsay that the Congress or the men who will strip the people of these\r\nrights will be handed down to perdition for allowing this bright and\r\nbeautiful heritage of civil liberty embodied in the powers and\r\nsovereign jurisdiction of the States to pass away from us.\r\n\r\n\"I am willing to trust brave men--men who have shown as much bravery\r\nas those who were engaged on battle-fields against the armed legions\r\nof the North; because I believe that even when they were fighting\r\nagainst the flag, of their country, the great mass of those people\r\nwere moved by high and conscientious convictions of duty. And in the\r\nspirit of Christianity, in the spirit which Jesus Christ exercised\r\nwhen he gave up his own life as a propitiation for a fallen world, I\r\nwould say to those Southern men, Come here in the Halls of Congress,\r\nand participate with us in passing laws which, if constitutionally\r\ncarried into effect, will control the interests and destinies of four\r\nmillions people, mostly living within the limits of your States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cook, of Illinois, replied: \"Mr. Speaker, in listening to the very\r\neloquent remarks of the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Rogers], I have\r\nbeen astonished to find that in his apprehension this bill is designed\r\nto deprive somebody, in some State of this Union, of some right which\r\nhe has heretofore enjoyed. I am only sorry that he was not specific\r\nenough; that he did not inform us what rights are to be taken away. He\r\nhas denounced this bill as dangerous to liberty, as calculated in its\r\ntendency at least to destroy the liberties of this country. I have\r\nexamined this bill with some care, and, so far as I have been able to\r\nunderstand it, I have found nothing in any provision of it which tends\r\nin any way to take from any man, white or black, a single right he\r\nenjoys under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"I would have been glad if he would have told us in what manner the\r\nwhite men of this country would have been placed in a worse condition\r\nthan they are now, if this becomes the law. This general denunciation\r\nand general assault of the bill, without pointing out one single thing\r\nwhich is to deprive one single man of any right he enjoys under the\r\nGovernment, seems to me not entitled to much weight.\r\n\r\n\"When those rights which are enumerated in this bill are denied to any\r\nclass of men, on account of race or color, when they are subject to a\r\nsystem of vagrant laws which sells them into slavery or involuntary\r\nservitude, which operates upon them as upon no other part of the\r\ncommunity, they are not secured in the rights of freedom. If a man can\r\nbe sold, the man is a slave. If he is nominally freed by the amendment\r\nto the Constitution, he has nothing in the world he can call his own;\r\nhe has simply the labor of his hands on which he can depend. Any\r\ncombination of men in his neighborhood can prevent him from having any\r\nchance to support himself by his labor. They can pass a law that a man\r\nnot supporting himself by labor shall be deemed a vagrant, and that a\r\nvagrant shall be sold. If this is the freedom we gave the men who have\r\nbeen fighting for us and in defense of the Government, if this is all\r\nwe have secured them, the President had far better never have issued\r\nthe Proclamation of Emancipation, and the country had far better never\r\nhave adopted the great ordinance of freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Does any man in this House believe that these people can be safely\r\nleft in these States without the aid of Federal legislation or\r\nmilitary power? Does any one believe that their freedom can be\r\npreserved without this aid? If any man does so believe, he is\r\nstrangely blind to the history of the past year; strangely blind to\r\nthe enactments passed by Legislatures touching these freedmen. And I\r\nshuddered as I heard the honorable gentleman from New Jersey [Mr.\r\nRogers] claiming that he was speaking and thinking in the spirit which\r\nanimated the Savior of mankind when he made atonement for our race;\r\nthat it was in that spirit he was acting when he was striving to have\r\nthese people left utterly defenseless in the hands of men who were\r\nproving, day by day, month by month, that they desire to oppress them,\r\nfor they had been made free against their consent. Every act of\r\nlegislation, every expression of opinion on their part, proves that\r\nthese people would be again enslaved if they were not protected by the\r\nmilitary arm of the Federal Government; without that they would be\r\nslaves to-day. And I submit, with all deference, that it is any thing\r\nbut the spirit which the gentleman claims to have exercised, which\r\nprompted the argument he has made.\r\n\r\n\"For myself, I trust that this bill will be passed, because I consider\r\nit the most appropriate means to secure the end desired, and that\r\nthese people will be protected. I trust that we will say to them,\r\nBecause upon our call you aided us to suppress this rebellion, because\r\nthe honor and faith of the nation were pledged for your protection, we\r\nwill maintain your freedom, and redeem that pledge.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the House of Representatives resumed the\r\nconsideration of this bill. A speech was made by Mr. Thayer, of\r\nPennsylvania. He said:\r\n\r\n\"This bill is the just sequel to, and the proper completion of, that\r\ngreat measure of national redress which opened the dungeon-doors of\r\nfour million human beings. Without this, in my judgment, that great\r\nact of justice will be paralyzed and made useless. With this, it will\r\nhave practical effect, life, vigor, and enforcement. It has been the\r\nfashion of gentlemen, holding a certain set of opinions, in this House\r\nto characterize that great measure to which I have referred as a\r\nrevolutionary measure.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it was a revolutionary measure. It was one of the greatest, one\r\nof the most humane, one of the most beneficial revolutions which ever\r\ncharacterized the history of a free State; but it was a revolution\r\nwhich, though initiated by the conflict of arms and rendered necessary\r\nas a measure of war against the public enemy, was accomplished within\r\nand under the provisions of the Constitution of the United States. It\r\nwas a revolution for the relief of human nature, a revolution which\r\ngave life, liberty, and hope to millions whose condition, until then,\r\nappeared to be one of hopeless despair. It was a revolution of which\r\nno freeman need be ashamed, of which every man who assisted in it\r\nwill, I am sure, in the future be proud, and which will illumine with\r\na great glory the history of this country.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing in this bill in respect to the employment of\r\nmilitary force that is not already in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. The power here conferred is expressly given by that\r\ninstrument, and has been exercised upon the most stupendous scale in\r\nthe suppression of the rebellion. What is this bill? I hope gentlemen,\r\neven on the opposite side of the House, will not suffer their minds to\r\nbe influenced by any such vague, loose, and groundless denunciations\r\nas these which have proceeded from the gentleman from New Jersey. The\r\nbill, after extending these fundamental immunities of citizenship to\r\nall classes of people in the United States, simply provides means for\r\nthe enforcement of these rights and immunities. How? Not by military\r\nforce, not through the instrumentality of military commanders, not\r\nthrough any military machinery whatever, but through the quiet,\r\ndignified, firm, and constitutional forms of judicial procedure. The\r\nbill seeks to enforce these rights in the same manner and with the\r\nsame sanctions under and by which other laws of the United States are\r\nenforced. It imposes duties upon the judicial tribunals of the country\r\nwhich require the enforcement of these rights. It provides for the\r\nadministration of laws to protect these rights. It provides for the\r\nexecution of laws to enforce them. Is there any thing appalling in\r\nthat? Is that a military despotism? Sir, it is a strange abuse of\r\nlanguage to say that a military despotism is established by wholesome\r\nand equal laws. Yet the gentleman declaimed by the hour, in vague and\r\nidle terms, against this bill, which has not a single offensive,\r\noppressive, unjust, unusual, or tyrannical feature in it. These civil\r\nrights and immunities which are to be secured, and which no man can\r\nconscientiously say ought to be denied, are to be enforced through the\r\nordinary instrumentalities of courts of justice.\r\n\r\n\"While engaged in this great work of restoration, it concerns our\r\nhonor that we forget not those who are unable to help themselves; who,\r\nwhatever may have been the misery and wretchedness of their former\r\ncondition, were on our side in the great struggle which has closed,\r\nand whose rights we can not disregard or neglect without violating the\r\nmost sacred obligations of duty and of honor. To us they look for\r\nprotection against the wrongs with which they are threatened. To us\r\nalone can they appeal in their helplessness for succor and defense. To\r\nus they hold out to-day their supplicating hands, asking for\r\nprotection for themselves and their posterity. We can not disregard\r\nthis appeal, and stand acquitted before the country and the world of\r\nbasely abandoning to a miserable fate those who have a right to demand\r\nthe protection of your flag and the immunities guaranteed to every\r\nfreeman by your Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Eldridge, of Wisconsin, opposed the bill, in a speech of which the\r\nfollowing are the concluding remarks:\r\n\r\n\"I had hoped that this subject would be allowed to rest. Gentlemen\r\nrefer us to individual cases of wrong perpetrated upon the freedmen of\r\nthe South as an argument why we should extend the Federal authority\r\ninto the different States to control the action of the citizens\r\nthereof. But, I ask, has not the South submitted to the altered state\r\nof things there, to the late amendment of the Constitution, to the\r\nloss of their slave property, with a cheerfulness and grace that we\r\ndid not expect? Have they not acquiesced more willingly than we dared\r\nto hope? Then why not trust them? Why not meet them with frankness and\r\nkindness? Why not encourage them with trust and confidence?\r\n\r\n\"I deprecate all these measures because of the implication they carry\r\nupon their face, that the people who have heretofore owned slaves\r\nintend to do them wrong. I do not believe it. So far as my knowledge\r\ngoes, and so far as my information extends, I believe that the people\r\nwho have held the freedmen slaves will treat them with more kindness,\r\nwith more leniency, than those of the North who make such loud\r\nprofessions of love and affection for them, and are so anxious to pass\r\nthese bills. They know their nature; they know their wants; they know\r\ntheir habits; they have been brought up together, and have none of the\r\nprejudices and unkind feelings which many in the North would have,\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\n\"I do not credit all these stories about the general feeling of\r\nhostility in the South toward the negro. So far as I have heard\r\nopinions expressed upon that subject, and I have conversed with many\r\npersons from that section of the country, they do not blame the negro\r\nfor any thing that has happened. As a general thing, he was faithful\r\nto them and their interests until the army reached the place and took\r\nhim from them. He has supported their wives and children in the\r\nabsence of the husbands and fathers in the armies of the South. He has\r\ndone for them what no one else could have done. They recognize his\r\ngeneral good feeling toward them, and are inclined to reciprocate that\r\nfeeling toward him.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that is the general feeling of the Southern people to-day.\r\nThe cases of ill-treatment are exceptional cases. They are like the\r\ncases which have occurred in the Northern States where the unfortunate\r\nhave been thrown upon our charity. Take for instance the stories of\r\nthe cruel treatment of the insane in the State of Massachusetts. They\r\nmay have been barbarously confined in the loathsome dens, as stated in\r\nparticular instances, but is that any evidence of the general ill-will\r\nof the people of the State of Massachusetts toward the insane? Is that\r\nany reason why the Federal arm should be extended to Massachusetts to\r\ncontrol and protect the insane there?\r\n\r\n\"It has also been said that certain paupers in certain States have\r\nbeen badly used--paupers, too, who were whites. Is that any reason why\r\nwe should extend the arm of the Federal Government to those States to\r\nprotect the poor who are thrown upon the charities of the people\r\nthere?\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we must yield to the altered state of things in this country. We\r\nmust trust the people; it is our duty to do so; we can not do\r\notherwise. And the sooner we place ourselves in a position where we\r\ncan win the confidence of our late enemies, where our counsels will be\r\nheeded, where our advice may be regarded, the sooner will the people\r\nof the whole country be fully reconciled to each other and their\r\nchanged relationship; the sooner will all the inhabitants of our\r\ncountry be in the possession of all the rights and immunities\r\nessential to their prosperity and happiness.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thornton, of Illinois, feared there was \"something hidden,\r\nsomething more than appears in the language\" of the bill. He feared \"a\r\ndesign to confer the right of suffrage upon the negro,\" and urged that\r\na proviso should be accepted \"restricting the meaning of the words\r\n'civil rights and immunities.'\" He remarked further: \"The most serious\r\nobjection that I have to this bill is, that it is an interference with\r\nthe rights of the South. It was remarked by my friend from Wisconsin\r\nthat it has often been intimated on this floor, and throughout the\r\ncountry, that whenever a man talks about either the Constitution or\r\nthe rights of the States, he is either a traitor or a sympathizer with\r\ntreason. I do not assume that the States are sovereign. They are\r\nsubordinate to the Federal Government. Sovereignty in this country is\r\nin the people, but the States have certain rights, and those rights\r\nare absolutely necessary to the maintenance of our system of\r\ngovernment. What are those rights? The right to determine and fix the\r\nlegal _status_ of the inhabitants of the respective States; the local\r\npowers of self-government; the power to regulate all the relations\r\nthat exist between husband and wife, parent and child, guardian and\r\nward; all the fireside and home rights, which are nearer and dearer to\r\nus than all others.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, this is but a stepping-stone to a centralization of the\r\nGovernment and the overthrow of the local powers of the States.\r\nWhenever that is consummated, then farewell to the beauty, strength,\r\nand power of this Government. There is nothing left but absolute,\r\ndespotic, central power. It lives no longer but as a naked despotism.\r\nThere is nothing left to admire and to cherish.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Windom, of Minnesota, next obtained the floor. Referring to the\r\nspeech of Mr. Rogers, he said: \"I wish to make another extract from\r\nthe speech of the gentleman from New Jersey. He said, 'If you pass\r\nthis bill, you will allow negroes to compete for the high office of\r\nthe President of the United States.' You will actually allow them to\r\ncompete for the Presidency of the United States! As for this fear\r\nwhich haunts the gentleman from New Jersey, if there is a negro in the\r\ncountry who is so far above all the white men of the country that only\r\nfour millions of his own race can elect him President of the United\r\nStates over twenty-six millions of white people, I think we ought to\r\nencourage such talent in the country.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the gentleman has far less confidence in the white race than I\r\nhave, if he is so timid in regard to negro competition. Does he really\r\nsuppose that black men are so far superior to white men that four\r\nmillions of them can elect a President of their own race against the\r\nwishes of thirty millions of ours? Ever since I knew any thing of the\r\nparty to which the gentleman belongs, it has entertained this same\r\nmorbid fear of negro competition; and sometimes I have thought that if\r\nwe were to contemplate the subject from their stand-point we would\r\nhave more charity than we do for this timidity and nervous dread which\r\nhaunts them. I beg leave, however, to assure the gentleman that there\r\nis not the slightest danger of electing a black President, and that he\r\nneed never vote for one, unless he thinks him better fitted for the\r\noffice than a white man.\"\r\n\r\nWith more direct reference to the merits of the question, Mr. Windom\r\nsaid: \"Our warrant for the passage of this bill is found in the genius\r\nand spirit of our institutions; but not in these alone. Fortunately,\r\nthe great amendment which broke the shackles from every slave in the\r\nland contains an express provision that 'Congress shall have power to\r\nenforce this article by appropriate legislation.'\r\n\r\n\"When this amendment was acted upon, it was well understood, as it is\r\nnow, that although the body of slavery might be destroyed, its spirit\r\nwould still live in the hearts of those who have sacrificed so much\r\nfor its preservation, and that if the freedmen were left to the tender\r\nmercy of their former masters, to whose heartless selfishness has been\r\nsuperadded a malignant desire for vengeance upon the negro for having\r\naided us in crushing the rebellion, his condition would be more\r\nintolerable than it was before the war. And hence the broad grant of\r\npower was made to enable Congress to enforce the spirit as well as the\r\nletter of the amendment. Now, sir, in what way is it proposed to\r\nenforce it? By denying to any one man a single right or privilege\r\nwhich he could otherwise constitutionally or properly enjoy? No. By\r\nconferring on any one person or class of persons a single right or\r\nimmunity which every other person may not possess? By no means. Does\r\nit give to the loyal negro any preference over the recent would-be\r\nassassins of the nation? Not at all. It merely declares that hereafter\r\nthere shall be no discrimination in civil rights or immunities among\r\nthe citizens of any State or territory of the United States on account\r\nof race, color, or previous condition of slavery, and that every\r\nperson, except such as are excluded by reason of crime, shall have the\r\nsame right to enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give\r\nevidence, to inherit, purchase, sell, hold, and convey real and\r\npersonal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and\r\nproceedings for the security of person and property, and shall be\r\nsubject to like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other.\r\n\r\n\"We know, and the whole world knows, that when in the hour of our\r\nextremity we called upon the black race to did us, we promised them\r\nnot liberty only, but all that that word liberty implies. All remember\r\nhow unwilling we were to do any thing which would inure to the benefit\r\nof the negro. I recall with shame the fact that when, five years ago,\r\nthe so-called Democracy--now Egyptians--were here in this capital, in\r\nthe White House, in the Senate, and on this floor, plotting the\r\ndestruction of the Government, and we were asked to appease them by\r\nsacrificing the negro, two-thirds of both houses voted to rivet his\r\nchains upon him so long as the republic should endure. A widening\r\nchasm yawned between the free and slave States, and we looked wildly\r\naround for that wherewith it might be closed. In our extremity we\r\nseized upon the negro, bound and helpless, and tried to cast him in.\r\nBut an overruling Providence heard the cries of the oppressed, and\r\nhurled his oppressors into that chasm by hundreds of thousands, until\r\nthe whole land was filled with mourning, yet still the chasm yawned.\r\nIn our anguish and terror, we felt that the whole nation would be\r\nspeedily ingulfed in one common ruin. It was then that the great\r\nemancipator and savior of his country, Abraham Lincoln, saw the danger\r\nand the remedy, and seizing four million bloody shackles, he wrenched\r\nthem from their victims, and standing with these broken manacles in\r\nhis hands upraised toward heaven, he invoked the blessing of the God\r\nof the oppressed, and cast them into the fiery chasm. That offering\r\nwas accepted, and the chasm closed.\r\n\r\n\"When the reports from Port Hudson and Fort Wagner thrilled all loyal\r\nhearts by the recital of the heroic deeds of the black soldier, we\r\nwere not reminded that if the negro were permitted to enjoy the same\r\nrights under the Government his valor helped to save that are\r\npossessed by the perjured traitors who sought its destruction, it\r\nwould 'lead to a war of races.' O no! Then we were in peril, and felt\r\ngrateful even to the negro, who stood between us and our enemies. Then\r\nour only hope of safety was in the brave hearts and strong arms of the\r\nsoldier at the front. Now, since by the combined efforts of our brave\r\nsoldiers, white and black, the military power of the South has been\r\noverthrown, and her Representatives are as eager to resume their\r\nplaces on this floor as five years ago they were to quit them for a\r\nplace in the rebel army, we are told that, having been victorious, it\r\nbecomes a great nation like ours to be magnanimous. I answer, it is\r\nfar more becoming to be just. I am willing to carry my magnanimity to\r\nthe verge of justice, but not one step beyond. I will go with him who\r\ngoes furthest in acts of generosity toward our former enemies, unless\r\nthose acts will be prejudicial to our friends. But when you advise me\r\nto sacrifice those who have stood by us during the war, in order to\r\nconciliate unrepentant rebels, whose hearts still burn with\r\nill-suppressed hatred to the Government, I scorn your counsel.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shellabarger, of Ohio, said: \"I agree with the gentleman on the\r\nother side of the House, that this bill can not be passed under that\r\nclause of the Constitution which provides that Congress may pass\r\nuniform rules of naturalization. Under that clause it is my opinion\r\nthat the act of naturalization must not only be the act of the\r\nGovernment, but also the act of the individual alien, by which he\r\nrenounces his former allegiance and accepts the new one. And that\r\nproposition and distinction will be found, I think, in all judicious\r\narguments upon the subject.\r\n\r\n\"There is another class of persons well recognized, not only in our\r\nconstitutional history, but also by the laws of nations, who are not\r\nforeigners, who occupy an intermediate position, and that intermediate\r\nposition is defined by the laws of nations by the word 'subjects.'\r\nSubjects are all persons who, being born in a given country, and under\r\na given government, do not owe an allegiance to any other government.\r\n\r\n\"To that class in this country, according to the decisions of our\r\ncourts hitherto, belong American Indians and slaves, and, according to\r\nthe Dred Scott decision, persons of African descent whose ancestors\r\nwere slaves. All these were subjects by every principle of\r\ninternational as well as of settled constitutional law in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, to that class belong the persons who are naturalized by\r\nthis bill. If they were not, indeed, citizens hitherto, they were at\r\nleast subjects of this Government, by reason of their birth, and by\r\nreason of the fact that they owed no foreign allegiance.\r\n\r\n\"That brings me to the next remark, and it is this: that these\r\nsubjects, not owing any foreign allegiance, no individual act of\r\ntheirs is required in order to their naturalization, because they owe\r\nno foreign allegiance to be renounced by their individual acts, and\r\nbecause, moreover, being domiciled in our own country, and continuing\r\nhere to reside, it is the individual election of each member of the\r\ntribe, or race, or class, to accept our nationality; therefore, no\r\nadditional individual act is required in order to his citizenship.\r\n\r\n\"That being proved, it is competent for the nationality, or for the\r\ngovernment, wherever that subject may reside, to naturalize that class\r\nof persons by treaty or by general law, as is proposed by the\r\namendment of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Raymond]. It is the act\r\nof the sovereign alone that is requisite to the naturalization of that\r\nclass of persons, and it may be done either by a single act\r\nnaturalizing entire races of men, or by adopting the heads of families\r\nout of those races, or it may be done to any extent, greater or less,\r\nthat may please the sovereign. For this proposition, I refer gentlemen\r\nwho desire to examine this subject to the authorities that may be\r\nfound collected in any judicious work on public law, and they will\r\nfind them very fully collected, certainly, in the notes to Wheaton.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, what power may do that act of naturalization, and how may\r\nit be exercised? That is also answered by these same authorities. It\r\nmay be done in this country either by an act of Congress, or it may be\r\ndone by treaty. It has been done again and again and again in both\r\nways in this country. It was done once in the case of the Choctaw\r\nIndians, as you will find in the Statutes-at-Large, where, in case the\r\nheads of families desired to remain and not to remove to the West, it\r\nwas provided by the treaty of September 27, 1830, that those families\r\nshould be naturalized as a class.\r\n\r\n\"Then, again, it was done in the other way, by an act of Congress, in\r\nthe case cited by my learned friend from Iowa [Mr. Wilson], in the\r\ncase of the Stockbridge Indians.\r\n\r\n\"It was done again, as you may remember, in the case of the Cherokees,\r\nin December, 1835. There again a class was naturalized by treaty.\"\r\n\r\nSome amendments having been proposed, the bill was recommitted to the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary, with the understanding that it should be\r\nreturned for consideration on Thursday of the following week.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on that day, March 8, the consideration of the bill being\r\nresumed, Mr. Broomall, of Pennsylvania, addressed the House, He viewed\r\nthe bill as beneficent in its provisions, since it made no\r\ndiscriminations against the Southern rebels, but granted them, as well\r\nas the negro, the rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\n\"A question might naturally arise whether we ought again to trust\r\nthose who have once betrayed us; whether we ought to give them the\r\nbenefits of a compact they have once repudiated. Yet the spirit of\r\nforgiveness is so inherent in the American bosom, that no party in the\r\ncountry proposes to withhold from these people the advantages of\r\ncitizenship; and this is saying much. With a debt that may require\r\ncenturies to pay; with so many living and mutilated witnesses of the\r\nhorrors of war; with so many saddened homes, so many of the widowed\r\nand fatherless pleading for justice, for retribution, if not revenge,\r\nit speaks well for the cause of Christian civilization in America that\r\nno party in the country proposes to deprive the authors of such\r\nimmeasurable calamity of the advantages of citizenship.\r\n\r\n\"But the election must be made. Some public legislative act is\r\nnecessary to show the world that those who have forfeited all claims\r\nupon the Government are not to be held to the strict rigor of the law\r\nof their own invoking, the decision of the tribunal of their own\r\nchoosing; that they are to be welcomed back as the prodigal son,\r\nwhenever they are ready to return as the prodigal son.\r\n\r\n\"The act under consideration makes that election. Its terms embrace\r\nthe late rebels, and it gives them the rights, privileges, and\r\nimmunities of citizens of the United States, though it does not\r\npropose to exempt them from punishment for their past crimes.\r\n\r\n\"I might consent that the glorious deeds of the last five years should\r\nbe blotted from the country's history; that the trophies won on a\r\nhundred battle-fields, the sublime visible evidences of the heroic\r\ndevotion of America's citizen soldiery, should be burned on the altar\r\nof reconstruction. I might consent that the cemetery at Gettysburg\r\nshould be razed to the ground; that its soil should be submitted to\r\nthe plow, and that the lamentation of the bereaved should give place\r\nto the lowing of cattle. But there is a point beyond which I will\r\nneither be forced nor persuaded. I will never consent that the\r\nGovernment shall desert its allies in the South, and surrender their\r\nrights and interests to the enemy, and in this I will make no\r\ndistinction of caste or color, either among friends or foes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond, of New York, was impressed with the importance of the\r\nmeasure. \"Whether we consider it by itself, simply as a proposed\r\nstatute, or in its bearings upon the general question of the\r\nrestoration of peace and harmony to the Union, I regard it as one of\r\nthe most important bills ever presented to this House for its action,\r\nworthy, in every respect, to enlist the coolest and the calmest\r\njudgment of every member whose vote must be recorded upon it.\"\r\n\r\nHe was in favor of the first part of the bill, which declares \"who\r\nshall be citizens of the United States, and declares that all shall be\r\ncitizens without distinction of race, color, or previous condition of\r\nservitude, who are, have been, or shall be born within the limits and\r\njurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, assuming, as I do, without any further argument, that\r\nCongress has the power of admitting to citizenship this great class of\r\npersons just set free by the amendment to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States abolishing slavery, I suppose I need not dwell here on\r\nthe great importance to that class of persons of having this boon\r\nconferred upon them.\r\n\r\n\"We have already conferred upon them the great, inestimable, priceless\r\nboon of personal liberty. I can not for one moment yield to what seems\r\nto be a general disposition to disparage the freedom we have given\r\nthem. I think the fact that we have conferred upon four million people\r\nthat personal liberty and freedom from servitude from this time\r\nforward for evermore, is one of the highest and most beneficent acts\r\never performed by any Government toward so large a class of its\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"Having gone thus far, I desire to go on by successive steps still\r\nfurther, and to elevate them in all respects, so far as their\r\nfaculties will allow and our power will permit us to do, to an\r\nequality with the other persons and races in this country. I desire,\r\nas the next step in the process of elevating that race, to give them\r\nthe rights of citizenship, or to declare by solemn statute that they\r\nare citizens of the United States, and thus secure to them whatever\r\nrights, immunities, privileges, and powers belong as of right to all\r\ncitizens of the United States. I hope no one will be prepared or\r\ninclined to say this is a trifling boon. If we do so estimate this\r\ngreat privilege, I fear we are scarcely in the frame of mind to act\r\nupon the great questions coming before us from day to day here. I, for\r\none, am not prepared or inclined to disparage American citizenship as\r\na personal qualification belonging to myself, or as conferred upon any\r\nof our fellow-citizens.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond expressed doubts as to the constitutionality of that part\r\nof the bill \"that provides for that class of persons thus made\r\ncitizens protection against anticipated inequality of legislation in\r\nthe several States.\"\r\n\r\nIn this direction he was desirous of avoiding a veto. He said:\r\n\"Moreover, on grounds of expediency, upon which I will not dwell, I\r\ndesire myself, and I should feel much relieved if I thought the House\r\nfully and heartily shared my anxiety, not to pass here any bill which\r\nshall be intercepted on its way to the statute-book by well-grounded\r\ncomplaints of unconstitutionality on the part of any other department\r\nof the Government.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Delano, of Ohio, followed, expressing doubts as to the\r\nconstitutionality of the measure. He considered it a serious\r\ninfringement of the rights of the States. He said: \"Now, sir, should\r\nthis bill be passed, that law of the State might be overthrown by the\r\npower of Congress. In my opinion, if we adopt the principle of this\r\nbill, we declare, in effect, that Congress has authority to go into\r\nthe States and manage and legislate with regard to all the personal\r\nrights of the citizen--rights of life, liberty, and property. You\r\nrender this Government no longer a Government of limited powers; you\r\nconcentrate and consolidate here an extent of authority which will\r\nswallow up all or nearly all of the rights of the States with respect\r\nto the property, the liberties, and the lives of its citizens.\"\r\n\r\nHe added, near the close of his address: \"I am not to be understood as\r\ndenying the power of this Government, especially that great war power\r\nwhich, when evoked, has no limit except as it is limited by necessity\r\nand the laws of civilized warfare. But, sir, in time of peace I would\r\nnot and I can not stand here and attempt the exercise of powers by\r\nthis General Government, which, if carried out with all the logical\r\nconsequences that follow their assumption, will, in my opinion,\r\nendanger the liberties of the country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kerr, of Indiana, maintained the theory that the States should\r\nsettle questions of citizenship as relating to those within their\r\nborders; that \"the privileges and immunities of citizenship in the\r\nStates are required to be attained, if at all, _according to the laws\r\nor Constitutions of the States_, and never in _defiance_ of them.\" To\r\nsustain this theory, he read from a number of authorities, and finally\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\"This bill rests upon a theory utterly inconsistent with, and in\r\ndirect hostility to, every one of these authorities. It asserts the\r\nright of Congress to regulate the laws which shall govern in the\r\nacquisition and ownership of property in the States, and to determine\r\nwho may go there and purchase and hold property, and to protect such\r\npersons in the enjoyment of it. The right of the State to regulate its\r\nown internal and domestic affairs, to select its own local policy, and\r\nmake and administer its own laws, for the protection and welfare of\r\nits own citizens, is denied. If Congress can declare what rights and\r\nprivileges shall be enjoyed in the States by the people of one class,\r\nit can, by the same kind of reasoning, determine what shall be enjoyed\r\nby every class. If it can say who may go into and settle in and\r\nacquire property in a State, it can also say who shall not. If it can\r\ndetermine who may testify and sue in the courts of a State, it may\r\nequally determine who shall not. If it can order the transfer of suits\r\nfrom the State to the Federal courts, where citizens of the same State\r\nalone are parties, in such cases as may arise under this bill, it can,\r\nby parity of logic, dispense with State courts entirely. Congress, in\r\nshort, may erect a great centralized, consolidated despotism in this\r\ncapital. And such is the rapid tendency of such legislation as this\r\nbill proposes.\"\r\n\r\nOn the succeeding day, March 9th, Mr. Wilson having demanded the\r\nprevious question, on the motion to recommit, was entitled to the\r\nfloor, but yielded portions of his time to Mr. Bingham and Mr.\r\nShellabarger.\r\n\r\nThe former had moved to amend the motion to recommit, by adding\r\ninstructions \"to strike out of the first section the words, 'and there\r\nshall be no discrimination in civil rights or immunities among\r\ncitizens of the United States, in any State or Territory of the United\r\nStates, on account of race, color, or previous condition of slavery,'\r\nand insert in the thirteenth line of the first section, after the word\r\n'right,' the words, 'in every State and Territory of the United\r\nStates.' Also, to strike out all parts of said bill which are penal,\r\nand which authorize criminal proceedings, and in lieu thereof to give\r\nto all citizens injured by denial or violation of any of the other\r\nrights secured or protected by said act, an action in the United\r\nStates courts with double costs in all cases of recovery, without\r\nregard to the amount of damages; and also to secure to such persons\r\nthe privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham said: \"And, first, I beg gentlemen to consider that I do\r\nnot oppose any legislation which is authorized by the Constitution of\r\nmy country to enforce in its letter and its spirit the bill of rights\r\nas embodied in that Constitution. I know that the enforcement of the\r\nbill of rights is the want of the republic. I know if it had been\r\nenforced in good faith in every State of the Union, the calamities,\r\nand conflicts, and crimes, and sacrifices of the past five years would\r\nhave been impossible.\r\n\r\n\"But I feel that I am justified in saying, in view of the text of the\r\nConstitution of my country, in view of all its past interpretations,\r\nin view of the manifest and declared intent of the men who framed it,\r\nthe enforcement of the Bill of Rights, touching the life, liberty, and\r\nproperty of every citizen of the republic, within every organized\r\nState of the Union, is of the reserved powers of the States, to be\r\nenforced by State tribunals and by State officials, acting under the\r\nsolemn obligations of an oath imposed upon them by the Constitution of\r\nthe United States. Who can doubt this conclusion who considers the\r\nwords of the Constitution, 'the powers not delegated to the United\r\nStates by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are\r\nreserved to the States respectively, or to the people?' The\r\nConstitution does not delegate to the United States the power to\r\npunish offenses against the life, liberty, or property of the citizen\r\nin the States, nor does it prohibit that power to the States, but\r\nleaves it as the reserved power of the States, to be by them\r\nexercised. The prohibitions of power by the Constitution to the States\r\nare express prohibitions, as that no State shall enter into any\r\ntreaty, etc., or emit bills of credit, or pass any bill of attainder,\r\netc. The Constitution does not prohibit States from the enactment of\r\nlaws for the general government of the people within their respective\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n\"The law in every State should be just; it should be no respecter of\r\npersons. It is otherwise now, and it has been otherwise for many years\r\nin many of the States of the Union. I should remedy that, not by\r\narbitrary assumption of power, but by amending the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, expressly prohibiting the States from any such abuse of\r\npower in the future. You propose to make it a penal offense for the\r\njudges of the States to obey the Constitution and laws of their\r\nStates, and for their obedience thereto to punish them by fine and\r\nimprisonment as felons. I deny your power to do this. You can not make\r\nan official act, done under color of law, and without criminal intent,\r\nand from a sense of public duty, a crime.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James F. Wilson.]\r\n\r\nMr. Shellabarger of Ohio said: \"I do not understand that there is now\r\nany serious doubt anywhere as to our power to admit by law to the\r\nrights of American citizenship entire classes or races who were born\r\nand continue to reside in our territory or in territory we acquire. I\r\nstated, the other day, some of the cases in which we naturalized\r\nraces, tribes, and communities in mass, and by single exercises of\r\nnational sovereignty. This we did by the treaty of April 30, 1800, by\r\nwhich we acquired Louisiana; also in the treaty of 1819, by which we\r\nacquired Florida; also in the treaty of 1848, by which we acquired\r\npart of Mexico; also by the resolution of March 1, 1845, annexing\r\nTexas, and the act of December 29, same year, admitting Texas into the\r\nUnion, we made all the people not slaves citizens; also by the treaty\r\nof September 27, 1830, we admitted to citizens certain heads of\r\nfamilies of Choctaws; also by the treaty of December 29, 1855, we did\r\nthe same as to the Cherokees; also by the act of March 3, 1843, we\r\nadmitted to full citizenship the Stockbridge tribe of Indians.\"\r\nReferring to the first section which his colleague had proposed to\r\namend, he said: \"Self-evidently this is the whole effect of this first\r\nsection. It secures, not to all citizens, but to all races as races\r\nwho are citizens, equality of protection in those enumerated civil\r\nrights which the States may deem proper to confer upon any races. Now,\r\nsir, can this Government do this? Can it prevent one race of free\r\ncitizens from being by State laws deprived as a race of all the civil\r\nrights for the securement of which his Government was created, and\r\nwhich are the only considerations the Government renders to him for\r\nthe Federal allegiance which he renders? It does seem to me that that\r\nGovernment which has the exclusive right to confer citizenship, and\r\nwhich is entitled to demand service and allegiance, which is supreme\r\nover that due to any State, may--nay, must--protect those citizens in\r\nthose rights which are fairly conducive and appropriate and necessary\r\nto the attainment of his 'protection' as a citizen. And I think those\r\nrights to contract, sue, testify, inherit, etc., which this bill says\r\nthe races shall hold as races in equality, are of that class which are\r\nfairly conducive and necessary as means to the constitutional end;\r\nto-wit, the protection of the rights of person and property of a\r\ncitizen. It has been found impossible to settle or define what are all\r\nthe indispensable rights of American citizenship. But it is perfectly\r\nwell settled what are some of these, and without which there is no\r\ncitizenship, either in this or any other Government. Two of these are\r\nthe right of petition and the right of protection in such property as\r\nit is lawful for that particular citizen to own.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate was closed by Mr. Wilson, Chairman of the Judiciary\r\nCommittee. He said: \"This bill, sir, has met with opposition in both\r\nhouses on the same ground that, in times gone by, before this land was\r\ndrenched in blood by the slaveholders' rebellion, was urged by those\r\nwho controlled the destinies of the southern portion of the country,\r\nand those who adhered to their fortunes in the North, for the purpose\r\nof riveting the chains of slavery and converting this republic into a\r\ngreat slave nation. The arguments which have been urged against this\r\nbill in both houses are but counterparts of the arguments used in\r\nopposition to the authority the Government sought to exercise in\r\ncontrolling and preventing the spread of slavery.\r\n\r\n\"Citizens of the United States, as such, are entitled to certain\r\nrights, and, being entitled to those rights, it is the duty of the\r\nGovernment to protect citizens in the perfect enjoyment of them. The\r\ncitizen is entitled to life, liberty, and the right to property. The\r\ngentleman from Ohio tells us, in the protection of these rights, the\r\ncitizen must depend upon the 'honest purpose of the several States,'\r\nand that the General Government can not interpose its strong right arm\r\nto defend the citizen in the enjoyment of life, liberty, and in\r\npossession of property. In other words, if the States of this Union,\r\nin their 'honest purpose,' like the honesty of purpose manifested by\r\nthe Southern States in times past, should deprive the citizen, without\r\ndue process of law, of life, liberty, and property, the General\r\nGovernment, which can draw the citizen by the strong bond of\r\nallegiance to the battle-field, has no power to intervene and set\r\naside a State law, and give the citizen protection under the laws of\r\nCongress in the courts of the United States; that at the mercy of the\r\nStates lie all the rights of the citizens of the United States; that\r\nwhile it was deemed necessary to constitute a great Government to\r\nrender secure the rights of the people, the framers of the Government\r\nturned over to the States the power to deprive the citizen of those\r\nthings for the security of which the Government was framed. In other\r\nwords, the little State of Delaware has a hand stronger than the\r\nUnited States; that revolted South Carolina may put under lock and key\r\nthe great fundamental rights belonging to the citizen, and we must be\r\ndumb; that our legislative power can not be exercised; that our courts\r\nmust be closed to the appeal of our citizens. That is the doctrine\r\nthis House of Representatives, representing a great free people, just\r\nemerged from a terrible war for the maintenance of American liberty,\r\nis asked to adopt.\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman from Ohio tells the House that civil rights involve all\r\nthe rights that citizens have under the Government; that in the term\r\nare embraced those rights which belong to the citizen of the United\r\nStates as such, and those which belong to a citizen of a State as\r\nsuch; and that this bill is not intended merely to enforce equality of\r\nrights, so far as they relate to citizens of the United States, but\r\ninvades the States to enforce equality of rights in respect to those\r\nthings which properly and rightfully depend on State regulations and\r\nlaws. My friend is too sound a lawyer, is too well versed in the\r\nConstitution of his country, to indorse that proposition on calm and\r\ndeliberate consideration. He knows, as every man knows, that this bill\r\nrefers to those rights which belong to men as citizens of the United\r\nStates and none other; and when he talks of setting aside the school\r\nlaws, and jury laws, and franchise laws of the States, by the bill now\r\nunder consideration, he steps beyond what he must know to be the rule\r\nof construction which must apply here, and, as the result of which\r\nthis bill can only relate to matters within the control of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nComparing Mr. Bingham's proposed amendment with the original bill, Mr.\r\nWilson said: \"What difference in principle is there between saying\r\nthat the citizen shall be protected by the legislative power of the\r\nUnited States in his rights by civil remedy and declaring that he\r\nshall be protected by penal enactments against those who interfere\r\nwith his rights? There is no difference in the principle involved. If\r\nwe may adopt the gentleman's mode, we may also select the mode\r\nprovided in this bill. There is a difference in regard to the expense\r\nof protection; there is also a difference as to the effectiveness of\r\nthe two modes. Beyond this, nothing. This bill proposes that the\r\nhumblest citizen shall have full and ample protection at the cost of\r\nthe Government, whose duty it is to protect him. The amendment of the\r\ngentleman recognizes the principle involved, but it says that the\r\ncitizen despoiled of his rights, instead of being properly protected\r\nby the Government, must press his own way through the courts and pay\r\nthe bills attendant thereon. This may do for the rich, but to the\r\npoor, who need protection, it is mockery. The highest obligation which\r\nthe Government owes to the citizen, in return for the allegiance\r\nexacted of him, is to secure him in the protection of his rights.\r\nUnder the amendment of the gentleman, the citizen can only receive\r\nthat protection in the form of a few dollars in the way of damages, if\r\nhe shall be so fortunate as to recover a verdict against a solvent\r\nwrong-doer. This is called protection. This is what we are asked to do\r\nin the way of enforcing the bill of rights. Dollars are weighed\r\nagainst the right of life, liberty, and property. The verdict of a\r\njury is to cover all wrongs and discharge the obligations of the\r\nGovernment to its citizens.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I can not see the justice of that doctrine. I assert that it is\r\nthe duty of the Government of the United States to provide proper\r\nprotection and to pay the costs attendant on it. We have gone out with\r\nthe strong arm of the Government and drawn from their homes, all over\r\nthis land, in obedience to the bond of allegiance which the Government\r\nholds on the citizen, hundreds of thousands of men to the\r\nbattle-field; and yet, while we may exercise this extraordinary power,\r\nthe gentleman claims that we can not extend the protecting hand of the\r\nGovernment to these men who have been battling for the life of the\r\nnation, but can only send them, at their own cost, to juries for\r\nverdicts of a few dollars in compensation for the most flagrant wrong\r\nto their most sacred rights. Let those support that doctrine who will,\r\nI can not.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Mr. Wilson's speech, Mr. Eldridge, of Wisconsin,\r\nmoved to lay the whole subject on the table. This motion was\r\nrejected--yeas, 32; nays, 118.\r\n\r\nThe House then rejected Mr. Bingham's proposed amendment, and\r\nrecommitted the bill to the Committee on the Judiciary.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of March the bill was reported back from the committee\r\nwith some amendments, one of which was to strike out in section one\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n     \"Without distinction of color, and there shall be no\r\n     discrimination in civil rights, or immunities among citizens\r\n     of the United States in any State or Territory of the United\r\n     States on account of race, color, or previous condition of\r\n     slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe words were omitted to satisfy some who feared that it might be\r\nheld by the courts that the right of suffrage was conferred thereby.\r\n\r\nAnother amendment proposed was the addition of a section to the bill,\r\nto-wit:\r\n\r\n     \"_And be it further enacted_, That upon all questions of law\r\n     arising in any case under the provisions of this act, a\r\n     final appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court of the United\r\n     States.\"\r\n\r\nOther amendments proposed and adopted were chiefly of a verbal\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe main question was finally taken, and the bill passed by the\r\nfollowing vote:\r\n\r\n     YEAS--Messrs.

While these were under consideration\r\nby the Senate, Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, made two motions to amend,\r\nwhich were rejected. He then moved to lay the bill on the table, and\r\nwas proceeding to make a speech, when he was informed that his motion\r\nwas not debatable. He then withdrew his motion to lay on the table,\r\nand moved to postpone the bill until the first Monday of December\r\nfollowing. Finding that the last amendment proposed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives was before the Senate, and that his motion could not\r\nbe entertained, he proceeded to make a speech on the question before\r\nthe Senate. He asserted that \"Congress has no authority or\r\njurisdiction whatever\" over the subject of legislation which the bill\r\ncontains. He closed his remarks with the following words: \"I\r\ntherefore, on the grounds that I have stated, oppose this bill. I know\r\nthat they weigh nothing with the dominant power here. What care I for\r\nthat? What care I for the manner in which my suggestions may be\r\nreceived by the majority? Nothing--less than nothing, if possible. I\r\nam performing my duty according to my sense of that duty; and in\r\ndespite of all opposition, of frowns or scoffs, or of any other\r\nopposition, come in what form it may, I will stand up to the last hour\r\nof my service in this chamber, and will, endeavor, as best I can, to\r\nperform my duty whatever may betide me.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendments of the House were agreed to, and the CIVIL RIGHTS BILL\r\nwanted only Executive approval to become a law of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL, AND THE VETO.\r\n\r\n     Doubts as to the President's Decision -- Suspense ended --\r\n     The Veto Message -- Mr. Trumbull's Answer -- Mr. Reverdy\r\n     Johnson defends the Message -- Rejoinder -- Remarks of Mr.\r\n     Yates -- Mr. Cowan appeals to the Country -- Mr. Stewart\r\n     shows how States may make the Law a Nullity -- Mr. Wade --\r\n     Mr. McDougall on Persian Mythology -- Mr. J. H. Lane defends\r\n     the President -- Mr. Wade -- The President's Collar -- Mr.\r\n     Brown -- Mr. Doolittle -- Mr. Garrett Davis -- Mr. Saulsbury\r\n     -- Yeas and Nays in the Senate -- Vote in the House -- The\r\n     Civil Rights Bill becomes a Law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Civil Rights Bill having finally passed through Congress, on the\r\n15th of March, by the concurrence of the Senate in the amendments of\r\nthe House, was submitted to the President for his approval. Much\r\nanxiety was felt throughout the country to know what would be the fate\r\nof the bill at the hands of the Executive. Some thought it incredible\r\nthat a President of the United States would veto so plain a\r\ndeclaration of rights, essential to the very existence of a large\r\nclass of inhabitants. Others were confident that Mr. Johnson's\r\napproval would not be given to a bill interfering, as they thought, so\r\nflagrantly with the rights of the States under the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAll doubts were dispelled, on the 27th of March, by the appearance of\r\nthe President's Secretary on the floor of the Senate, who said, in\r\nformal phrase: \"Mr. President, I am directed by the President of the\r\nUnited States to return to the Senate, in which house it originated,\r\nthe bill entitled 'An act to protect all persons in the United States\r\nin their civil rights, and to furnish the means of their vindication,'\r\nwith his objections thereto in writing.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Senate then read the message, which was heard\r\nwith profound attention by the Senators, and a large assembly which\r\nthronged the galleries, drawn thither in anticipation of the\r\nPresident's veto message.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\n     \"I regret that the bill which has passed both houses of\r\n     Congress, entitled 'An act to protect all persons in the\r\n     United States in their civil rights, and furnish the means\r\n     for their vindication,' contains provisions which I can not\r\n     approve, consistently with my sense of duty to the whole\r\n     people and my obligations to the Constitution of the United\r\n     States. I am therefore constrained to return it to the\r\n     Senate, the house in which it originated, with my objections\r\n     to its becoming a law.\r\n\r\n     \"By the first section of the bill, all persons born in the\r\n     United States, and not subject to any foreign power,\r\n     excluding Indians not taxed, are declared to be citizens of\r\n     the United States. This provision comprehends the Chinese of\r\n     the Pacific States, Indians subject to taxation, the people\r\n     called Gypsies, as well as the entire race designated as\r\n     blacks, people of color, negroes, mulattoes, and persons of\r\n     African blood. Every individual of those races, born in the\r\n     United States, is by the bill made a citizen of the United\r\n     States. It does not purport to declare or confer any other\r\n     right of citizenship than Federal citizenship. It does not\r\n     purport to give these classes of persons any _status_ as\r\n     citizens of States, except that which may result from their\r\n     _status_ as citizens of the United States. The power to\r\n     confer the right of State citizenship is just as exclusively\r\n     with the several States as the power to confer the right of\r\n     Federal citizenship is with Congress.\r\n\r\n     \"The right of Federal citizenship thus to be conferred on\r\n     the several excepted races before mentioned is now, for the\r\n     first time, proposed to be given by law. If, as is claimed\r\n     by many, all persons who are native-born, already are, by\r\n     virtue of the Constitution, citizens of the United States,\r\n     the passage of the pending bill can not be necessary to make\r\n     them such. If, on the other hand, such persons are not\r\n     citizens, as may be assumed from the proposed legislation to\r\n     make them such, the grave question presents itself, whether,\r\n     when eleven of the thirty-six States are unrepresented in\r\n     Congress, at this time it is sound policy to make our entire\r\n     colored population and all other excepted classes citizens\r\n     of the United States? Four millions of them have just\r\n     emerged from slavery into freedom. Can it be reasonably\r\n     supposed that they possess the requisite qualifications to\r\n     entitle them to all the privileges and immunities of\r\n     citizens of the United States? Have the people of the\r\n     several States expressed such a conviction? It may also be\r\n     asked whether it is necessary that they should be declared\r\n     citizens in order that they may be secured in the enjoyment\r\n     of civil rights? Those rights proposed to be conferred by\r\n     the bill are, by Federal as well as by State laws, secured\r\n     to all domiciled aliens and foreigners even before the\r\n     completion of the process of naturalization, and it may\r\n     safely be assumed that the same enactments are sufficient to\r\n     give like protection and benefits to those for whom this\r\n     bill provides special legislation. Besides, the policy of\r\n     the Government, from its origin to the present time, seems\r\n     to have been that persons who are strangers to and\r\n     unfamiliar with our institutions and our laws should pass\r\n     through a certain probation, at the end of which, before\r\n     attaining the coveted prize, they must give evidence of\r\n     their fitness to receive and to exercise the rights of\r\n     citizens as contemplated by the Constitution of the United\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n     \"The bill, in effect, proposes a discrimination against\r\n     large numbers of intelligent, worthy, and patriotic\r\n     foreigners, and in favor of the negro, to whom, after long\r\n     years of bondage, the avenues to freedom and intelligence\r\n     have now been suddenly opened. He must, of necessity, from\r\n     his previous unfortunate condition of servitude, be less\r\n     informed as to the nature and character of our institutions\r\n     than he who, coming from abroad, has to some extent at\r\n     least, familiarized himself with the principles of a\r\n     Government to which he voluntarily intrusts 'life, liberty,\r\n     and the pursuit of happiness.' Yet it is now proposed by a\r\n     single legislative enactment to confer the rights of\r\n     citizens upon all persons of African descent, born within\r\n     the extended limits of the United States, while persons of\r\n     foreign birth, who make our land their home, must undergo a\r\n     probation of five years, and can only then become citizens\r\n     upon proof that they are of 'good moral character, attached\r\n     to the principles of the Constitution of the United States,\r\n     and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the\r\n     same.'\r\n\r\n     \"The first section of the bill also contains an enumeration\r\n     of the rights to be enjoyed by these classes, so made\r\n     citizens, 'in every State and Territory in the United,\r\n     States.' These rights are, 'To make and enforce contracts,\r\n     to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase,\r\n     lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property,'\r\n     and to have 'full and equal benefit of all laws and\r\n     proceedings for the security of persons and property as is\r\n     enjoyed by white citizens.' So, too, they are made subject\r\n     to the same punishment, pains, and penalties in common with\r\n     white citizens, and to none others. Thus a perfect equality\r\n     of the white and black races is attempted to be fixed by\r\n     Federal law, in every State of the Union, over the vast\r\n     field of State jurisdiction covered by these enumerated\r\n     rights. In no one of these can any State ever exercise any\r\n     power of discrimination between the different races.\r\n\r\n     \"In the exercise of State policy over matters exclusively\r\n     affecting the people of each State, it has frequently been\r\n     thought expedient to discriminate between the two races. By\r\n     the statutes of some of the States, Northern as well as\r\n     Southern, it is enacted, for instance, that no white person\r\n     shall intermarry with a negro or mulatto. Chancellor Kent\r\n     says, speaking of the blacks, that 'marriages between them\r\n     and whites are forbidden in some of the States where slavery\r\n     does not exist, and they are prohibited in all the\r\n     slaveholding States, and when not absolutely contrary to\r\n     law, they are revolting, and regarded as an offense against\r\n     public decorum.'\r\n\r\n     \"I do not say this bill repeals State laws on the subject of\r\n     marriage between the two races, for as the whites are\r\n     forbidden to intermarry with the blacks, the blacks can only\r\n     make such contracts as the whites themselves are allowed to\r\n     make, and therefore can not, under this bill, enter into the\r\n     marriage contract with the whites. I cite this\r\n     discrimination, however, as an instance of the State policy\r\n     as to discrimination, and to inquire whether, if Congress\r\n     can abrogate all State laws of discrimination between the\r\n     two races in the matter of real estate, of suits, and of\r\n     contracts generally, Congress may not also repeal the State\r\n     laws as to the contract of marriage between the two races?\r\n     Hitherto every subject embraced in the enumeration of rights\r\n     contained in this bill has been considered as exclusively\r\n     belonging to the States. They all relate to the internal\r\n     policy and economy of the respective States. They are\r\n     matters which in each State concern the domestic condition\r\n     of its people, varying in each according to its own peculiar\r\n     circumstances, and the safety and well-being of its own\r\n     citizens. I do not mean to say that upon all these subjects\r\n     there are not Federal restraints, as, for instance, in the\r\n     State power of legislation over contracts, there is a\r\n     Federal limitation that no State shall pass a law impairing\r\n     the obligations of contracts; and as to crimes, that no\r\n     State shall pass an _ex post facto_ law; and as to money,\r\n     that no State shall make any thing but gold and silver a\r\n     legal tender. But where can we find a Federal prohibition\r\n     against the power of any State to discriminate, as do most\r\n     of them, between aliens and citizens, between artificial\r\n     persons called corporations and natural persons, in the\r\n     right to hold real estate?\r\n\r\n     \"If it be granted that Congress can repeal all State laws\r\n     discriminating between whites and blacks, in the subjects\r\n     covered by this bill, why, it may be asked, may not Congress\r\n     repeal in the same way all State laws discriminating between\r\n     the two races on the subject of suffrage and office? If\r\n     Congress can declare by law who shall hold lands, who shall\r\n     testify, who shall have capacity to make a contract in a\r\n     State, then Congress can by law also declare who, without\r\n     regard to color or race, shall have the right to sit as a\r\n     juror or as a judge, to hold any office, and, finally, to\r\n     vote, 'in every State and Territory of the United States.'\r\n     As respects the Territories, they come within the power of\r\n     Congress, for, as to them, the law-making power is the\r\n     Federal power; but as to the States, no similar provisions\r\n     exist, vesting in Congress the power 'to make rules and\r\n     regulations' for them.\r\n\r\n     \"The object of the second section of the bill is to afford\r\n     discriminating protection to colored persons in the full\r\n     enjoyment of all the rights secured to them by the preceding\r\n     section. It declares 'that any person who, under color of\r\n     any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, shall\r\n     subject, or cause to be subjected, any inhabitant of any\r\n     State or Territory to the deprivation of any right secured\r\n     or protected by this act, or to different punishment, pains,\r\n     or penalties on account of such person having at one time\r\n     been held in a condition of slavery or involuntary\r\n     servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the\r\n     party shall have been duly convicted, or by reason of his\r\n     color or race, than is prescribed for the punishment of\r\n     white persons, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and,\r\n     on conviction, shall be punished by fine not exceeding\r\n     $1,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both,\r\n     in the discretion of the court.' This section seems to be\r\n     designed to apply to some existing or future law of a State\r\n     or Territory which may conflict with the provisions of the\r\n     bill now under consideration. It provides for counteracting\r\n     such forbidden legislation by imposing fine and imprisonment\r\n     upon the legislators who may pass such conflicting laws, or\r\n     upon the officers or agents who shall put, or attempt to\r\n     put, them into execution. It means an official offense, not\r\n     a common crime committed against law upon the persons or\r\n     property of the black race. Such an act may deprive the\r\n     black man of his property, but not of the right to hold\r\n     property. It means a deprivation of the right itself, either\r\n     by the State Judiciary or the State Legislature. It is\r\n     therefore assumed that, under this section, members of State\r\n     Legislatures who should vote for laws conflicting with the\r\n     provisions of the bill; that judges of the State courts who\r\n     should render judgments in antagonism with its terms; and\r\n     that marshals and sheriffs, who should, as ministerial\r\n     officers, execute processes, sanctioned by State laws and\r\n     issued by State judges, in execution of their judgments,\r\n     could be brought before other tribunals, and there subjected\r\n     to fine and imprisonment for the performance of the duties\r\n     which such State laws might impose.\r\n\r\n     \"The legislation thus proposed invades the judicial power of\r\n     the State. It says to every State court or judge, If you\r\n     decide that this act is unconstitutional; if you refuse,\r\n     under the prohibition of a State law, to allow a negro to\r\n     testify; if you hold that over such a subject-matter the\r\n     State law is paramount, and 'under color' of a State law\r\n     refuse the exercise of the right to the negro, your error of\r\n     judgment, however conscientious, shall subject you to fine\r\n     and imprisonment. I do not apprehend that the conflicting\r\n     legislation which the bill seems to contemplate is so likely\r\n     to occur as to render it necessary at this time to adopt a\r\n     measure of such doubtful constitutionality.\r\n\r\n     \"In the next place, this provision of the bill seems to be\r\n     unnecessary, as adequate judicial remedies could be adopted\r\n     to secure the desired end without invading the immunities of\r\n     legislators, always important to be preserved in the\r\n     interest of public liberty; without assailing the\r\n     independence of the judiciary, always essential to the\r\n     preservation of individual rights; and without impairing the\r\n     efficiency of ministerial officers, always necessary for the\r\n     maintenance of public peace and order. The remedy proposed\r\n     by this section seems to be, in this respect, not only\r\n     anomalous, but unconstitutional; for the Constitution\r\n     guarantees nothing with certainty, if it does not insure to\r\n     the several States the right of making and executing laws in\r\n     regard to all matters arising within their jurisdiction,\r\n     subject only to the restriction that, in cases of conflict\r\n     with the Constitution and constitutional laws of the United\r\n     States, the latter should be held to be the supreme law of\r\n     the land.\r\n\r\n     \"The third section gives the district courts of the United\r\n     States exclusive 'cognizance of all crimes and offenses\r\n     committed against the provisions of this act,' and\r\n     concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts of the\r\n     United States of all civil and criminal cases 'affecting\r\n     persons who are denied or can not enforce in the courts or\r\n     judicial tribunals of the State or locality where they may\r\n     be any of the rights secured to them by the first section.'\r\n     The construction which I have given to the second section is\r\n     strengthened by this third section, for it makes clear what\r\n     kind of denial or deprivation of the rights secured by the\r\n     first section was in contemplation. It is a denial or\r\n     deprivation of such rights 'in the courts or judicial\r\n     tribunals of the State.' It stands, therefore, clear of\r\n     doubt, that the offense and the penalties provided in the\r\n     second section are intended for the State judge, who, in the\r\n     clear exercise of his function as a judge, not acting\r\n     ministerially, but judicially, shall decide contrary to this\r\n     Federal law. In other words, when a State judge, acting upon\r\n     a question involving a conflict between a State law and a\r\n     Federal law, and bound, according to his own judgment and\r\n     responsibility, to give an impartial decision between the\r\n     two, comes to the conclusion that the State law is valid and\r\n     the Federal law is invalid, he must not follow the dictates\r\n     of his own judgment, at the peril of fine and imprisonment.\r\n     The legislative department of the Government of the United\r\n     States thus takes from the judicial department of the States\r\n     the sacred and exclusive duty of judicial decision, and\r\n     converts the State judge into a mere ministerial officer,\r\n     bound to decree according to the will of Congress.\r\n\r\n     \"It is clear that, in States which deny to persons whose\r\n     rights are secured by the first section of the bill any one\r\n     of those rights, all criminal and civil cases affecting them\r\n     will, by the provisions of the third section, come under the\r\n     exclusive cognizance of the Federal tribunals. It follows\r\n     that if, in any State which denies to a colored person any\r\n     one of all those rights, that person should commit a crime\r\n     against the laws of the State--murder, arson, rape, or any\r\n     other crime--all protection and punishment through the\r\n     courts of the State are taken away, and he can only be tried\r\n     and punished in the Federal courts. How is the criminal to\r\n     be tried? If the offense is provided for and punished by\r\n     Federal law, that law, and not the State law, is to govern.\r\n\r\n     \"It is only when the offense does not happen to be within\r\n     the purview of the Federal law that the Federal courts are\r\n     to try and punish him under any other law; then resort is to\r\n     be had to 'the common law, as modified and changed' by State\r\n     legislation, 'so far as the same is not inconsistent with\r\n     the Constitution and laws of the United States.' So that\r\n     over this vast domain of criminal jurisprudence, provided by\r\n     each State for the protection of its own citizens, and for\r\n     the punishment of all persons who violate its criminal laws,\r\n     Federal law, wherever it can be made to apply, displaces\r\n     State law.\r\n\r\n     \"The question here naturally arises, from what source\r\n     Congress derives the power to transfer to Federal tribunals\r\n     certain classes of cases embraced in this section. The\r\n     Constitution expressly declares that the judicial power of\r\n     the United States 'shall extend to all cases in law and\r\n     equity arising under this Constitution, the laws of the\r\n     United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made,\r\n     under their authority; to all cases affecting embassadors,\r\n     other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of\r\n     admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to\r\n     which the United States shall be a party; to controversies\r\n     between two or more States, between a State and citizens of\r\n     another State, between citizens of different States, between\r\n     citizens of the same State claiming land under grants of\r\n     different States, and between a State, or the citizens\r\n     thereof, and foreign States, citizens, or subjects.'\r\n\r\n     \"Here the judicial power of the United States is expressly\r\n     set forth and defined; and the act of September 24, 1789,\r\n     establishing the judicial courts of the United States, in\r\n     conferring upon the Federal courts jurisdiction over cases\r\n     originating in State tribunals, is careful to confine them\r\n     to the classes enumerated in the above recited clause of the\r\n     Constitution. This section of the bill undoubtedly\r\n     comprehends case, and authorizes the exercise of powers that\r\n     are not, by the Constitution, within the jurisdiction of the\r\n     courts of the United States. To transfer them to those\r\n     courts would be an exercise of authority well calculated to\r\n     excite distrust and alarm on the part of all the States; for\r\n     the bill applies alike to all of them--as well to those that\r\n     have as to those that have not been engaged in rebellion.\r\n\r\n     \"It may be assumed that this authority is incident to the\r\n     power granted to Congress by the Constitution, as recently\r\n     amended, to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the article\r\n     declaring that 'neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,\r\n     except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall\r\n     have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United\r\n     States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.' It can\r\n     not, however, be justly claimed that, with a view to the\r\n     enforcement of this article of the Constitution, there is,\r\n     at present, any necessity for the exercise of all the powers\r\n     which this bill confers.\r\n\r\n     \"Slavery has been abolished, and, at present, nowhere exists\r\n     within the jurisdiction of the United States; nor has there\r\n     been, nor is it likely there will be, any attempt to revive\r\n     it by the people of the States. If, however, any such\r\n     attempt shall be made, it will then become the duty of the\r\n     General Government to exercise any and all incidental powers\r\n     necessary and proper to maintain inviolate this great\r\n     constitutional law of freedom.\r\n\r\n     \"The fourth section of the bill provides that officers and\r\n     agents of the Freedmen's Bureau shall be empowered to make\r\n     arrests, and also that other officers may be specially\r\n     commissioned for that purpose by the President of the United\r\n     States. It also authorizes circuit courts of the United\r\n     States and the superior courts of the Territories to\r\n     appoint, without limitation, commissioners, who are to be\r\n     charged with the performance of _quasi_ judicial duties. The\r\n     fifth section empowers the commissioners so to be selected\r\n     by the courts to appoint, in writing, under their hands, one\r\n     or more suitable persons, from time to time, to execute\r\n     warrants and other processes described by the bill. These\r\n     numerous official agents are made to constitute a sort of\r\n     police, in addition to the military, and are authorized to\r\n     summon a _posse comitatus_ and even to call to their aid\r\n     such portion of the land and naval forces of the United\r\n     States, or of the militia, 'as may be necessary to the\r\n     performance of the duty with which they are charged.'\r\n\r\n     \"This extraordinary power is to be conferred upon agents\r\n     irresponsible to the Government and to the people, to whose\r\n     number the discretion of the commissioners is the only\r\n     limit, and in whose hands such authority might be made a\r\n     terrible engine of wrong, oppression, and fraud. The general\r\n     statutes regulating the land and naval forces of the United\r\n     States, the militia, and the execution of the laws, are\r\n     believed to be adequate for every emergency which can occur\r\n     in time of peace. If it should prove otherwise, Congress\r\n     can, at any time, amend those laws in such manner as, while\r\n     subserving the public welfare, not to jeopard the rights,\r\n     interests, and liberties of the people.\r\n\r\n     \"The seventh section provides that a fee of ten dollars\r\n     shall be paid to each commissioner in every case brought\r\n     before him, and a fee of five dollars to his deputy, or\r\n     deputies, 'for each person he or they may arrest and take\r\n     before any such commissioner,' 'with such other fees as may\r\n     be deemed reasonable by such commissioner,' 'in general for\r\n     performing such other duties as may be required in the\r\n     premises.' All these fees are to be 'paid out of the\r\n     Treasury of the United States,' whether there is a\r\n     conviction or not; but, in case of conviction, they are to\r\n     be recoverable from the defendant. It seems to me that,\r\n     under the influence of such temptations, bad men might\r\n     convert any law, however beneficent, into an instrument of\r\n     persecution and fraud.\r\n\r\n     \"By the eighth section of the bill, the United States\r\n     courts, which sit only in one place for white citizens, must\r\n     migrate, with the marshal and district attorney (and\r\n     necessarily with the clerk, although he is not mentioned),\r\n     to any part of the district, upon the order of the\r\n     President, and there hold a court 'for the purpose of the\r\n     more speedy arrest and trial of persons charged with a\r\n     violation of this act;' and there the judge and the officers\r\n     of the court must remain, upon the order of the President,\r\n     'for the time therein designated.'\r\n\r\n     \"The ninth section authorizes the 'President, or such person\r\n     as he may empower for that purpose, to employ such part of\r\n     the land and naval forces of the United States, or of the\r\n     militia, as shall be necessary to prevent the violation and\r\n     enforce the due execution of this act.' This language seems\r\n     to imply a permanent military force, that is to be always at\r\n     hand, and whose only business is to be the enforcement of\r\n     this measure over the vast region where it is intended to\r\n     operate.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not propose to consider the policy of this bill. To me\r\n     the details of the bill seem fraught with evil. The white\r\n     race and the black race of the South have hitherto lived\r\n     together under the relation of master and slave--capital\r\n     owning labor. Now, suddenly, that relation is changed, and,\r\n     as to the ownership, capital and labor are divorced. They\r\n     stand, now, each master of itself. In this new relation, one\r\n     being necessary to the other, there will be a new\r\n     adjustment, which both are deeply interested in making\r\n     harmonious. Each has equal power in settling the terms, and,\r\n     if left to the laws that regulate capital and labor, it is\r\n     confidently believed that they will satisfactorily work out\r\n     the problem. Capital, it is true, has more intelligence; but\r\n     labor is never so ignorant as not to understand its own\r\n     interests, not to know its own value, and not to see that\r\n     capital must pay that value. This bill frustrates this\r\n     adjustment. It intervenes between capital and labor, and\r\n     attempts to settle questions of political economy through\r\n     the agency of numerous officials, whose interest it will be\r\n     to foment discord between the two races; for, as the breach\r\n     widens, their employment will continue, and when it is\r\n     closed, their occupation will terminate.\r\n\r\n     \"In all our history, in all our experience as a people\r\n     living under Federal and State law, no such system as that\r\n     contemplated by the details of this bill has ever before\r\n     been proposed or adopted. They establish, for the security\r\n     of the colored race, safeguards which go infinitely beyond\r\n     any that the General Government has ever provided for the\r\n     white race. In fact, the distinction of race and color is,\r\n     by the bill, made to operate in favor of the colored and\r\n     against the white race. They interfere with the municipal\r\n     legislation of the States, with the relations existing\r\n     exclusively between a State and its citizens, or between\r\n     inhabitants of the same State--an absorption and assumption\r\n     of power by the General Government which, if acquiesced in,\r\n     must sap and destroy our federative system of limited\r\n     powers, and break down the barriers which preserve the\r\n     rights of the States. It is another step, or rather stride,\r\n     to centralization and the concentration of all legislative\r\n     power in the National Government. The tendency of the bill\r\n     must be to resuscitate the spirit of rebellion, and to\r\n     arrest the progress of those influences which are more\r\n     closely drawing around the States the bonds of union and\r\n     peace.\r\n\r\n     \"My lamented predecessor, in his proclamation of the 1st of\r\n     January, 1863, ordered and declared that all persons held as\r\n     slaves within certain States and parts of States therein\r\n     designated, were and thenceforward should be free; and,\r\n     further, that the Executive Government of the United States,\r\n     including the military and naval authorities thereof, would\r\n     recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons. This\r\n     guarantee has been rendered especially obligatory and sacred\r\n     by the amendment of the Constitution abolishing slavery\r\n     throughout the United States. I, therefore, fully recognize\r\n     the obligation to protect and defend that class of our\r\n     people whenever and wherever it shall become necessary, and\r\n     to the full extent compatible with the Constitution of the\r\n     United States.\r\n\r\n     \"Entertaining these sentiments, it only remains for me to\r\n     say that I will cheerfully coöperate with Congress in any\r\n     measure that may be necessary for the protection of the\r\n     civil rights of the freedmen, as well as those of all other\r\n     classes of persons throughout the United States, by judicial\r\n     process under equal and impartial laws, in conformity with\r\n     the provisions of the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n     \"I now return the bill to the Senate, and regret that, in\r\n     considering the bills and joint resolutions--forty-two in\r\n     number--which have been thus far submitted for my approval,\r\n     I am compelled to withhold my assent from a second measure\r\n     that has received the sanction of both houses of Congress.\r\n\r\n                                             \"ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n     \"WASHINGTON, D. C., _March_ 27, 1866.\"\r\n\r\nThe death and funeral obsequies of Senator Foot prevented the Senate\r\nfrom proceeding to the consideration of the President's veto message\r\nfor more than a week after it was read. On the 4th of April the Civil\r\nRights Bill came up to be reconsidered, the question being, \"Shall the\r\nbill pass, the objections of the President notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nIt devolved upon Mr. Trumbull, the author of the bill, to answer the\r\nobjections of the President. In answer to the President's position\r\nthat the bill conferred only Federal citizenship, and did not give any\r\n_status_ as citizens of States, Mr. Trumbull said: \"Is it true that\r\nwhen a person becomes a citizen of the United States he is not also a\r\ncitizen of every State where he may happen to be? On this point I will\r\nrefer to a decision pronounced by the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, delivered by Chief-Justice Marshall, the most eminent jurist\r\nwho ever sat upon an American bench. In the case of Gassies _vs._\r\nBallon, reported in 6 Peters, the Chief-Justice, in delivering the\r\nopinion of the court, says:\r\n\r\n     \"'The defendant in error is alleged in the proceedings to be\r\n     a citizen of the United Stated States, naturalized in\r\n     Louisiana, and residing there. This is equivalent to an\r\n     averment that he is a citizen of that State. _A citizen of\r\n     the United States residing in any State of the Union is a\r\n     citizen of that State._'\"\r\n\r\nThe message declared \"that the right of Federal citizenship is now for\r\nthe first time proposed to be given by law.\" \"This,\" said Mr.\r\nTrumbull, \"is not a misapprehension of the law, but a mistake in fact,\r\nas will appear by references to which I shall call the attention of\r\nthe Senate.\" Mr. Trumbull then referred to the \"collective\r\nnaturalization\" of citizens of Louisiana, Texas, and Cherokees,\r\nChoctaw, and Stockbridge Indians.\r\n\r\nTo the remark in the message that \"if, as many claim, native-born\r\npersons are already citizens of the United States, this bill can not\r\nbe necessary to make them such,\" Mr. Trumbull replied: \"An act\r\ndeclaring what the law is, is one of the most common of acts known by\r\nlegislative bodies. When there is any question as to what the law is,\r\nand for greater certainty, it is the most common thing in the world to\r\npass a statute declaring it.\"\r\n\r\nTo the objection that eleven States were unrepresented, the Senator\r\nreplied: \"This is a standing objection in all the veto messages, yet\r\nthe President has signed some forty bills. If there is any thing in\r\nthis objection, no bill can pass Congress till the States are\r\nrepresented here. Sir, whose fault is it that eleven States are not\r\nrepresented? By what fault of theirs is it that twenty-five loyal\r\nStates which have stood by this Union and by the Constitution are to\r\nbe deprived of their right to legislate? If the reason assigned is a\r\ngood one now, it has been a good one all the time for the last five\r\nyears. If the fact that some States have rebelled against the\r\nGovernment is to take from the Government the right to legislate, then\r\nthe criminal is to take advantage of his crime; the innocent are to be\r\npunished for the guilty.\r\n\r\n\"But the President tells us that 'the bill, in effect, proposes a\r\ndiscrimination against large numbers of intelligent, worthy, and\r\npatriotic foreigners, and in favor of the negro.' Is that true? What\r\nis the bill? It declares that there shall be no distinction in civil\r\nrights between any other race or color and the white race. It declares\r\nthat there shall be no different punishment inflicted on a colored man\r\nin consequence of his color than that which is inflicted on a white\r\nman for the same offense. Is that a discrimination in favor of the\r\nnegro and against the foreigner--a bill the only effect of which is to\r\npreserve equality of rights?\r\n\r\n\"But perhaps it may be replied to this that the bill proposes to make\r\na citizen of every person born in the United States, and, therefore,\r\nit discriminates in that respect against the foreigner. Not so;\r\nforeigners are all upon the same footing, whether black or white. The\r\nwhite child who is born in the United States a citizen is not to be\r\npresumed at its birth to be the equal intellectually with the worthy,\r\nintelligent, and patriotic foreigner who emigrates to this country.\r\nAnd, as is suggested by a Senator behind me, even the infant child of\r\na foreigner born in this land is a citizen of the United States long\r\nbefore his father. Is this, therefore, a discrimination against\r\nforeigners?\r\n\r\n\"The President also has an objection to the making citizens of Chinese\r\nand Gypsies. I am told that but few Chinese are born in this country,\r\nand where the Gypsies are born, I never knew. [Laughter.] Like Topsy,\r\nit is questionable, whether they were born at all, but 'just come.'\r\n[Laughter.]\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, perhaps the best answer to this objection that the bill\r\nproposes to make citizens of Chinese and Gypsies, and this reference\r\nto the foreigners, is to be found in a speech delivered in this body\r\nby a Senator occupying, I think, the seat now occupied across the\r\nchamber by my friend from Oregon, [Mr. Williams,] less than six years\r\nago, in reply to a message sent to this body by Mr. Buchanan, the then\r\nPresident of the United States, returning, with his objections, what\r\nwas known as the Homestead Bill. On that occasion the Senator to whom\r\nI allude said:\r\n\r\n     \"'But this idea about \"poor foreigners,\" somehow or other,\r\n     bewilders and haunts the imagination of a great many. * * * * *\r\n\r\n     \"'I am constrained to say that I look upon this objection to\r\n     the bill as a mere quibble on the part of the President, and\r\n     as being hard-pressed for some excuse in withholding his\r\n     approval of the measure; and his allusion to foreigners in\r\n     this connection looks to me more like the _ad captandum_ of\r\n     the mere politician or demagogue, than a grave and sound\r\n     reason to be offered by the President of the United States\r\n     in a veto message upon so important a measure as the\r\n     Homestead Bill.'\r\n\r\n\"That was the language of Senator Andrew Johnson, now President of the\r\nUnited States. [Laughter.] That is probably the best answer to this\r\nobjection, though I should hardly have ventured to use such harsh\r\nlanguage in reference to the President as to accuse him of quibbling\r\nand of demagoguery, and of playing the mere politician in sending a\r\nveto message to the Congress of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe President had urged an objection that if Congress could confer\r\ncivil rights upon persons without regard to color or race, it might\r\nalso confer upon them political rights, and among them that of\r\nsuffrage. In reply to this, Mr. Trumbull referred to the policy of the\r\nPresident himself in undertaking to \"reörganize State governments in\r\nthe disloyal States.\" He \"claimed and exercised the power to protect\r\ncolored persons in their civil rights,\" and yet, when \"urged to allow\r\nloyal blacks to vote,\" he held that \"he had no power; it was\r\nunconstitutional.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir,\" continued Mr. Trumbull, \"the granting of civil rights does\r\nnot and never did, in this country, carry with it rights, or, more\r\nproperly speaking, political privileges. A man may be a citizen in\r\nthis country without a right to vote or without a right to hold\r\noffice. The right to vote and hold office in the States depends upon\r\nthe legislation of the various States; the right to hold certain\r\noffices under the Federal Government depends upon the Constitution of\r\nthe United States. The President must be a natural-born citizen, and a\r\nSenator or Representative must be a citizen of the United States for a\r\ncertain number of years before he is eligible to a seat either in this\r\nor the other House of Congress; so that the fact of being a citizen\r\ndoes not necessarily qualify a person for an office, nor does it\r\nnecessarily authorize him to vote. Women are citizens; children are\r\ncitizens; but they do not exercise the elective franchise by virtue of\r\ntheir citizenship. Foreigners, as is stated by the President in this\r\nmessage, before they are naturalized are protected in the rights\r\nenumerated in this bill, but because they possess those rights in\r\nmost, if not all, the States, that carries with it no right to vote.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, what rights do citizens of the United States have? To be a\r\ncitizen of the United States carries with it some rights, and what are\r\nthey? They are those inherent, fundamental rights which belong to free\r\ncitizens or free men in all countries, such as the rights enumerated\r\nin this bill, and they belong to them in all the States of the Union.\r\nThe right of American citizenship means something. It does not mean,\r\nin the case of a foreigner, that when he is naturalized he is to be\r\nleft entirely to the mercy of State legislation. He has a right, when\r\nduly naturalized, to go into any State of the Union, and to reside\r\nthere, and the United States Government will protect him in that\r\nright. It will protect a citizen of the United States, not only in one\r\nof the States of the Union, but it will protect him in foreign lands.\r\n\r\n\"Every person residing in the United States is entitled to the\r\nprotection of that law by the Federal Government, because the Federal\r\nGovernment has jurisdiction of such questions. American citizenship\r\nwould be little worth if it did not carry protection with it.\r\n\r\n\"How is it that every person born in these United States owes\r\nallegiance to the Government? Every thing that he is or has, his\r\nproperty and his life, may be taken by the Government of the United\r\nStates in its defense, or to maintain the honor of the nation. And can\r\nit be that our ancestors struggled through a long war and set up this\r\nGovernment, and that the people of our day have struggled through\r\nanother war, with all its sacrifices and all its desolation, to\r\nmaintain it, and at last that we have got a Government which is\r\nall-powerful to command the obedience of the citizen, but has no power\r\nto afford him protection? Is that all that this boasted American\r\ncitizenship amounts to? Go tell it, sir, to the father whose son was\r\nstarved at Andersonville; or the widow whose husband was slain at\r\nMission Ridge; or the little boy who leads his sightless father\r\nthrough the streets of your city, made blind by the winds and the sand\r\nof the Southern coast; or the thousand other mangled heroes to be seen\r\non every side, that this Government, in defense of which the son and\r\nthe husband fell, the father lost his eyes, and the others were\r\ncrippled, had the right to call these persons to its defense, but has\r\nno right to protect the survivors or their friends in any right\r\nwhatever in any of the States. Sir, it can not be. Such is not the\r\nmeaning of our Constitution. Such is not the meaning of American\r\ncitizenship. This Government, which would go to war to protect its\r\nmeanest--I will not say citizen--inhabitant, if you please, in any\r\nforeign land, whose rights were unjustly encroached upon, has\r\ncertainly some power to protect its own citizens in their own country.\r\nAllegiance and protection are reciprocal rights.\"\r\n\r\nTo the President's objection to the second section of the bill, that\r\nit discriminated in favor of colored persons, Mr. Trumbull replied:\r\n\"It says, in effect, that no one shall subject a colored person to a\r\ndifferent punishment than that inflicted on a white person for the\r\nsame offense. Does that discriminate in favor of the colored person?\r\nWhy, sir, the very object and effect of the section is to prevent\r\ndiscrimination, and language, it seems to me, could not more plainly\r\nexpress that object and effect. It may be said that it is for the\r\nbenefit of the black man, because he is now, in some instances,\r\ndiscriminated against by State laws; but that is the case with all\r\nremedial statutes. They are for the relief of the persons who need the\r\nrelief, not for the relief of those who have the right already; and\r\nwhen those needing the relief obtain it, they stand upon the precise\r\nfooting of those who do not need the benefit of the law.\"\r\n\r\nThe President had further objected to this section, that \"it provides\r\nfor counteracting such forbidden legislation by imposing fine and\r\nimprisonment upon the legislators who may pass such conflicting laws.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see,\" said Mr. Trumbull, \"if that is the language or the\r\nproper construction of the section. I will read again the first lines\r\nof it. It declares 'that any person who, under color of any law,\r\nordinance, regulation, or custom, shall subject, or cause to be\r\nsubjected, etc., * * * shall be punished,' etc.\r\n\r\n\"Who is to be punished? Is the law to be punished? Are the men who\r\nmake the law to be punished? Is that the language of the bill? Not at\r\nall. If any person, 'under color of any law,' shall subject another to\r\nthe deprivation of a right to which he is entitled, he is to be\r\npunished. Who? The person who, under the color of the law, does the\r\nact, not the men who made the law. In some communities in the South a\r\ncustom prevails by which different punishment is inflicted upon the\r\nblacks from that meted out to whites for the same offense. Does this\r\nsection propose to punish the community where the custom prevails? or\r\nis it to punish the person who, under color of the custom, deprives\r\nthe party of his right? It is a manifest perversion of the meaning of\r\nthe section to assert any thing else.\r\n\r\n\"But it is said that under this provision judges of the courts and\r\nministerial officers who are engaged in execution of any such statutes\r\nmay be punished, and that is made an objection to this bill. I admit\r\nthat a ministerial officer or a judge, if he acts corruptly or\r\nviciously in the execution or under color of an illegal act, may be\r\nand ought to be punished; but if he acted innocently, the judge would\r\nnot be punished. Sir, what is a crime? It is a violation of some\r\npublic law, to constitute which there must be an act, and a vicious\r\nwill in doing the act; or, according to the definition in some of the\r\nlaw-books, to constitute a crime there must be a violation of a public\r\nlaw, in the commission of which there must be a union or joint\r\noperation of act and intent, or criminal negligence; and a judge who\r\nacted innocently, and not viciously or oppressively, would never be\r\nconvicted under this act. But, sir, if he acted knowingly, viciously,\r\nor oppressively, in disregard of a law of the United States, I repeat,\r\nhe ought to be punished, and it is no anomaly to prescribe a\r\npunishment in such a case. Very soon after the organization of this\r\nGovernment, in the first years of its existence, the Congress of the\r\nUnited States provided for punishing officers who, under color of\r\nState law, violated the laws of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull then read from an act of Congress passed in 1790,\r\nproviding for the punishment of certain offenses against foreign\r\nministers, and said: \"By this provision all officers executing any\r\nprocess in violation of the laws of the United States are to be\r\nsubject to a much longer imprisonment than is provided by this bill.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, there is another answer, in my judgment, more conclusive,\r\nto all these objections to this second section, which is the vital\r\npart of the bill. Without it, it would scarcely be worth the paper on\r\nwhich the bill is written. A law without a penalty, without a\r\nsanction, is of little value to any body. What good does it do for the\r\nLegislature to say, 'Do this, and forbear to do that,' if no\r\nconsequence is to follow the act of disobedience? This is the vitality\r\nof the bill. What is the objection that is made to it, and which seems\r\neven to have staggered some friends of the measure? It is because it\r\nreads in the first section that any person who, 'under color of law,'\r\nshall commit these offenses, shall be subject to the penalties of the\r\nlaw. Suppose those words had been left out, and the bill read, 'any\r\nperson who shall subject any inhabitant of a State to different\r\npunishment by reason of his color shall be punished,' would there have\r\nbeen any objection to the bill then? That is the way most criminal\r\nlaws read. That is the way the law punishing conspiracies against the\r\nGovernment reads. If two or more persons conspire together to\r\noverthrow the Government, or by force to resist its authority, they\r\nare liable to indictment, and, upon conviction, to imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary and to heavy fine. Would the fact that the persons\r\nengaged in the conspiracy were judges or governors or ministerial\r\nofficers, acting under color of any statute or custom, screen them\r\nfrom punishment? Surely not.\r\n\r\n\"The words 'under color of law' were inserted as words of limitation,\r\nand not for the purpose of punishing persons who would not have been\r\nsubject to punishment under the act if they had been omitted. If an\r\noffense is committed against a colored person simply because he is\r\ncolored, in a State where the law affords him the same protection as\r\nif he were white, this act neither has nor was intended to have any\r\nthing to do with his case, because he has adequate remedies in the\r\nState courts; but if he is discriminated against, under color of State\r\nlaws, because he is colored, then it becomes necessary to interfere\r\nfor his protection.\r\n\r\n\"The assumption that State judges and other officials are not to be\r\nheld responsible for violations of United States laws when done under\r\ncolor of State statutes or customs is akin to the maxim of the English\r\nlaw that the king can do no wrong. It places officials above the law;\r\nit is the very doctrine out of which the rebellion was hatched.\r\n\r\n\"Every thing that was done by that wicked effort to overturn our\r\nGovernment was done under color of law. The rebels insisted that they\r\nhad a right to secede; they passed ordinances of secession, they set\r\nup State governments, and all that they did was under color of law.\r\nAnd if parties committing these high crimes are to go free because\r\nthey acted under color of law, why is not Jeff Davis and every other\r\nrebel chief discharged at once? Why did this country put forth all its\r\nresources of men and money to put down the rebellion against the\r\nauthority of the Government except it had a right to do so, even as\r\nagainst those who were acting under color of law? Lee, with his rebel\r\nhordes, thundering upon the outskirts of this very city, was acting\r\nunder color of law; every judge who has held a court in the Southern\r\nStates for the last four years, and has tried and convicted of treason\r\nmen guilty of no other offense than loyalty to the Union, acted under\r\ncolor of law.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if we had authority by the use of the army and the war power to\r\nput down rebels acting under color of law, I put the question to every\r\nlawyer, if we had not authority to do that through the courts and the\r\njudicial tribunals if it had been practicable? Suppose it had been\r\npracticable, through the marshals, to arrest the Legislature which\r\nconvened at Montgomery, and undertook to take the State of Alabama out\r\nof the Union and set up a government in hostility thereto, ought it\r\nnot to have been done? Was not that a conspiracy against this\r\nGovernment? When the Legislature assembled at Montgomery in 1861, and\r\nresolved that the connection between Alabama and the United States was\r\ndissolved, and when its members took steps to maintain that\r\ndeclaration; when the same thing was done in South Carolina, and\r\ncourts were organized to carry out the scheme, will any body tell me\r\nit would not have been competent, had it been practicable, for the\r\nUnited States courts in those States to have issued process for the\r\narrest of every one of those legislators, governors, judges, and all.\r\nAnd, sir, had this been done, and it had turned out upon trial that\r\nany of the parties arrested had been engaged in armed hostility\r\nagainst the United States, as some of them had been when, with arms in\r\ntheir hands, they seized the arsenals and other public property of the\r\nUnited States, would they not have been found guilty of treason and\r\nhung for treason? and would the fact that they had acted under color\r\nof law have afforded them any protection?\"\r\n\r\nThe President, in his Veto Message, had said, \"I do not apprehend that\r\nthe conflicting legislation which the bill seems to contemplate is so\r\nlikely to occur as to render it necessary, at this time, to adopt a\r\nmeasure of such doubtful constitutionality.\"\r\n\r\n\"That statement,\" replied Mr. Trumbull, \"makes it necessary that I\r\nshould advert to the facts and show whether there is any likelihood of\r\nsuch conflicting legislation; and my testimony comes from the\r\nPresident himself, or those acting under his authority.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having referred to legislative enactments of several of the\r\nSouthern States very oppressive to the colored people, Mr. Trumbull\r\nremarked: \"Now, sir, what becomes of this declaration that there is no\r\nnecessity for any measure of this kind? Here are the laws of Texas, of\r\nMississippi, of Virginia, to which I have referred; and laws equally\r\noppressive exist in some of the other States. Is there no necessity to\r\nprotect a freedman when he is liable to be whipped if caught away from\r\nhome? no necessity to protect a freedman in his rights when he is not\r\npermitted to hold or lease a piece of ground in a State? no necessity\r\nto protect a freedman in his rights, who will be reduced to a slavery\r\nworse than that from which he has been emancipated if a law is\r\npermitted to be carried into effect? Sir, these orders emanate and\r\nthis information comes from officers acting by presidential authority,\r\nand yet the President tells us there is no danger of conflicting\r\nlegislation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having answered other objections of the President, Mr. Trumbull\r\nsaid: \"I have now gone through this Veto Message, replying with what\r\npatience I could command to its various objections to the bill. Would\r\nthat I could stop here, that there was no occasion to go further; but\r\njustice to myself, justice to the State whose representative I am,\r\njustice to the people of the whole country, in legislation for whose\r\nbehalf I am called to participate, justice to the Constitution I am\r\nsworn to support, justice to the rights of American citizenship it\r\nsecures, and to human liberty, now imperiled, require me to go\r\nfurther. Gladly would I refrain speaking of the spirit of this\r\nmessage, of the dangerous doctrines it promulgates, of the\r\ninconsistencies and contradictions of its author, of his encroachments\r\nupon the constitutional rights of Congress, of his assumption of\r\nunwarranted powers, which, if persevered in and not checked by the\r\npeople, must eventually lead to a subversion of the Government and the\r\ndestruction of liberty.\r\n\r\n\"Congress, in the passage of the bill under consideration, sought no\r\ncontroversy with the President. So far from it, the bill was proposed\r\nwith a view to carry out what were supposed to be the views of the\r\nPresident, and was submitted to him before its introduction in the\r\nSenate. I am not about to relate private declarations of the\r\nPresident, but it is right that the American people should know that\r\nthe controversy which exists between him and Congress in reference to\r\nthis measure is of his own seeking. Soon after Congress met, it became\r\napparent that there was a difference of opinion between the President\r\nand some members of Congress in regard to the condition of the\r\nrebellious States and the rights to be secured to freedmen.\r\n\r\n\"The President, in his annual message, had denied the constitutional\r\npower of the General Government to extend the elective franchise to\r\nnegroes, but he was equally decided in the assertion of the right of\r\nevery man to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This was his\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n     \"'But while I have no doubt that now, after the close of the\r\n     war, it is not competent for the General Government to\r\n     extend the elective franchise in the several States, it is\r\n     equally clear that good faith requires the security of the\r\n     freedmen in their liberty and their property.'\r\n\r\n\"There were some members of Congress who expressed the opinion that in\r\nthe reörganization of the rebellious States the right of suffrage\r\nshould be extended to the colored man, though this was not the\r\nprevailing sentiment of Congress. All were anxious for a\r\nreörganization of the rebellious States, and their admission to full\r\nparticipation in the Federal Government as soon as these relations\r\ncould be restored with safety to all concerned. Feeling the importance\r\nof harmonious action between the different departments of the\r\nGovernment, and an anxious desire to sustain the President, for whom I\r\nhad always entertained the highest respect, I had frequent interviews\r\nwith him during the early part of the session. Without mentioning any\r\nthing said by him, I may with propriety state that, acting from the\r\nconsiderations I have stated, and believing that the passage of a law\r\nby Congress, securing equality in civil rights to freedmen and all\r\nother inhabitants of the United States, when denied by State\r\nauthorities, would do much to relieve anxiety in the North, to induce\r\nthe Southern States to secure these rights by their own action, and\r\nthereby remove many of the obstacles to an early reconstruction, I\r\nprepared the bill substantially as it is now returned with the\r\nPresident's objections. After the bill was introduced and printed, a\r\ncopy was furnished him, and at a subsequent period, when it was\r\nreported that he was hesitating about signing the Freedmen's Bureau\r\nBill, he was informed of the condition of the Civil Rights Bill then\r\npending in the House, and a hope expressed that if he had objections\r\nto any of its provisions he would make them known to its friends, that\r\nthey might be remedied, if not destructive of the measure; that there\r\nwas believed to be no disposition on the part of Congress, and\r\ncertainly none on my part, to have bills presented to him which he\r\ncould not approve. He never indicated to me, nor, so far as I know, to\r\nany of its friends, the least objection to any of the provisions of\r\nthe bill till after its passage. And how could he, consistently with\r\nhimself? The bill was framed, as was supposed, in entire harmony with\r\nhis views, and certainly in harmony with what he was then and has\r\nsince been doing in protecting freedmen in their civil rights all\r\nthrough the rebellious States. It was strictly limited to the\r\nprotection of the civil rights belonging to every freeman, the\r\nbirthright of every American citizen, and carefully avoided conferring\r\nor interfering with political rights or privileges of any kind.\r\n\r\n* * * * \"If the bill now before us, and which goes no further than to\r\nsecure civil rights to the freedman, can not be passed, then the\r\nconstitutional amendment proclaiming freedom to all the inhabitants of\r\nthe land is a cheat and a delusion.\r\n\r\n\"I can not better conclude what I have to say than in the language of\r\nMr. Johnson on the occasion of the veto of the Homestead Bill, when,\r\nafter stating that the fact that the President was inconsistent and\r\nchanged his opinion with reference to a great measure and a great\r\nprinciple, is no reason why a Senator or Representative, who has acted\r\nunderstandingly, should change his opinion. He said:\r\n\r\n     \"'I hope the Senate and House of Representatives, who have\r\n     sanctioned this bill by more than a two-thirds majority,\r\n     will, according to the Constitution, exercise their\r\n     privilege and power, and let the bill become a law of the\r\n     land, according to the high behest of the American people.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day, April 5th, Mr. Johnson, of Maryland, made a speech\r\nsustaining the Veto Message. He argued that negroes were not citizens\r\nof the United States by reason of their birth in the United States,\r\nand that Congress had no authority by law to declare them such. To\r\nsustain his position, he made quotations from the opinion of the\r\nminority in the Dred Scott case, as rendered by Mr. Justice Curtis. He\r\nthen proceeded to reply to some of Mr. Trumbull's arguments against\r\nthe Veto Message: \"The honorable member from Illinois disposes of the\r\nPresident's objection to the first section of this bill by saying that\r\nit is merely declaratory. I know it is competent for any legislative\r\nbody, on a question where difference of opinions exist in relation to\r\nany legal proposition, to remove them by declaratory legislation; but\r\nthat is not the purpose of this bill. It professes to be passed in the\r\nexercise of a positive and absolute power to change the law--not to\r\ndeclare what the law was in order to remove doubts, but to make the\r\nlaw. It assumes, or otherwise there would be no occasion for it, that\r\nbirth alone does not confer citizenship; and assuming that no\r\ncitizenship would exist in consequence of birth alone, it declares\r\nthat birth alone, in spite of State constitution and State laws, shall\r\nconfer citizenship. Now, with all deference to the opinion of the\r\nhonorable Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, that seems to me\r\nto be a proposition as clearly erroneous as any proposition can be in\r\nrelation to constitutional law. The States were sovereign before the\r\nConstitution was adopted; and the Constitution not only, according to\r\nits very terms, does not profess to confer upon the Government of the\r\nUnited States all governmental power, but as far as Congress is\r\nconcerned, professes to confer upon that department of the Government\r\nonly the particular delegated powers there enumerated; but so anxious\r\nwere the framers of that instrument and the great men of that day, to\r\nwhom the subsequent organization of this Government was left, that\r\nalthough they had no doubt as to the principle that only the delegated\r\npowers were granted, (and the debates in the Convention itself as well\r\nas the debates in the conventions of the several States, when the\r\nConstitution was before them for adoption or rejection, all went upon\r\nthe theory that no powers were conferred except such as were expressly\r\ngranted, or as were reasonably implied to be as necessary to carry out\r\nthe powers expressly granted,) by the tenth amendment adopted recently\r\nafter the Constitution went into operation, and recommended by the\r\nmen, many of whom were the framers of the Constitution itself, that\r\nthe powers not delegated by the Constitution, and not denied to the\r\nStates by the same instrument, were to be considered reserved to the\r\nStates respectively, or to the people.\r\n\r\n\"Standing, therefore, as well upon the nature of the Government\r\nitself, as a Government of enumerated powers specially delegated, as\r\nupon the express provision that every thing not granted was to be\r\nconsidered as remaining with the States unless the Constitution\r\ncontained some particular prohibition of any power before belonging to\r\nthe States, what doubt can there be that if a State possessed the\r\npower to declare who should be her citizens before the Constitution\r\nwas adopted that power remains now as absolute and as conclusive as it\r\nwas when the Constitution was adopted? The bill, therefore, changes\r\nthe whole theory of the Government.\r\n\r\n\"The President, then, I think, is right. I go further than he does. He\r\nexpresses a doubt whether Congress has the power; I affirm, with all\r\ndeference to the better judgment of the majority of the Senate who\r\nvoted for the bill, and to that of the honorable Chairman of the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary, that it is perfectly clear that no such\r\npower exists in Congress as the one attempted to be exercised by the\r\nfirst section. I hold, with Mr. Justice Curtis--and his opinion to\r\nthis day has never been questioned--that citizenship of the United\r\nStates consequent upon birth in a State is to depend upon the fact\r\nwhether the constitution and laws of the State make the party so born\r\na citizen of the State.\r\n\r\n\"But that is not all. This first section has another provision. Not\r\nsatisfied with making the parties citizens and clothing them with all\r\nthe rights belonging to white citizens by the laws of the States, it\r\nsays that they 'shall be subject to like punishment, pains, and\r\npenalties, and to none other.' That invades the jurisdiction of the\r\nStates over their criminal code. Congress assumes to define a crime,\r\nand defining a crime gives to its own courts exclusive jurisdiction\r\nover the crime and the party charged with its perpetration. It strikes\r\nat the criminal code of the States. The result, therefore, of the\r\nthree provisions in this section is, that contrary to State\r\nconstitutions and State laws, it converts a man that is not a citizen\r\nof a State into a citizen of the State; it gives him all the rights\r\nthat belong to a citizen of the State; and it provides that his\r\npunishment shall only be such as the State laws impose upon white\r\ncitizens. Where is the authority to do that? If it exists, it is still\r\nmore obvious that the result is an entire annihilation of the power of\r\nthe States. It seems to be the fashion of the hour--I do not know that\r\nmy honorable friend from Illinois goes to that extent--to hold to the\r\ndoctrine that the sooner every thing is vested in the Government of\r\nthe United States the better for the country. It is a perilous\r\ndelusion. If such a proposition had been supposed to be found any\r\nwhere in the Constitution of the United States, it never would have\r\nbeen adopted by the people; and if it is assumed, or if it is\r\nconsidered as constitutionally existing by virtue of some power not\r\nbefore known, the Government will not last half a century. I have not\r\ntime to read from the writings of Mr. Madison and Mr. Hamilton and the\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court on the question.\r\n\r\n\"But you, Mr. President, know very well that consolidation of power in\r\nthe Government of the United States was looked upon as certain ruin to\r\nrepublican institutions. In the first place, it would be sure to\r\nresult in anarchy; and in the second place, in order to be saved from\r\nthe horrors of anarchy, we should be compelled to take refuge in\r\ndespotic power, and the days of constitutional liberty would soon be\r\nnumbered. The doubt then was, and the doubt now should be more firmly\r\nsettled in the public mind, that a country as extensive as that of the\r\nUnited States can not exist except by means of divided sovereignties;\r\none sovereignty having charge of all external matters, or matters\r\nbetween the States to which the powers of the States are inadequate;\r\nthe other sovereignties having power over all internal matters to the\r\nmanagement of which they are adequate. Despotism would soon be our\r\nfate, preceded by anarchy; the military chieftain instead of being\r\nlooked upon, as he should be by every republican, with alarm and\r\nconcern, would be hailed as a savior, in order to save us from the\r\nhorrors of disorganization.\r\n\r\n\"The honorable member referred to the act of 1790, but it relates\r\nentirely to different subjects, and all the statutes to which he\r\nadverted are statutes of the same description. What is the\r\ntwenty-sixth section of the act of 1790 to which he referred? The\r\npreceding section provided that no one should sue a foreign minister,\r\nand the section to which my friend referred particularly, said that if\r\na party did sue a foreign minister he should be liable to be punished.\r\nCertainly; but why? Because the Government of the United States was\r\nvested with the exclusive authority in all cases depending upon the\r\nlaw of nations; and the law of nations saving from responsibility\r\nembassadors accredited to the United States, for civil debts, he who\r\nattempted to interfere offended against the Government, and he\r\noffended in relation to a subject exclusively committed to the General\r\nGovernment. The power, therefore, which Congress exerted in the\r\nparticular legislation to which the honorable member reverted is just\r\nthe power which they exert when they provide for the punishment of any\r\nman who counterfeits the currency of the United States, or forges its\r\npaper, or forges its bonds, or interferes with the administration of\r\nthe Post-office Department. These are all powers incidental to the\r\npossession of the express power, and in the case to which he adverted\r\nthe express power was one necessarily belonging to the Government,\r\nbecause it was a power belonging to and regulated by the law of\r\nnations, and not by any municipal regulation.\r\n\r\n\"The honorable member from Illinois tells us that the President's\r\nobjection, that there are eleven States not now represented, is\r\nentitled to no consideration whatever. The honorable member seems to\r\nsuppose that the President adverted to the fact that there were eleven\r\nStates not represented as showing that Congress possessed no\r\nconstitutional authority to legislate upon the subject, supposing that\r\nthey would have had the authority if those States were represented.\r\nThat is not the view taken by the President; it is an entire\r\nmisapprehension of the doctrine of the President. He says no such\r\nthing, and he intimates no such thing. But assuming, what in another\r\npart of the message he denies, that the authority might be considered\r\nas existing, he submits as a question of policy whether it is right to\r\nchange the whole domestic economy of those eleven States, in the\r\nabsence of any representation upon this floor from them. My honorable\r\nfriend asks whose fault it is that they are not represented. Why are\r\nthey not here? He says their hands are reeking with the blood of loyal\r\nmen; that they are unable to take the oath which a statute that he\r\nassumes to be constitutional has provided; and he would have the\r\ncountry and the Senate to believe that that is the reason why they are\r\nnot here. Is that the fact, Mr. President? These States are organized,\r\nand how organized? What have they done? They have abolished slavery by\r\nan astonishing unanimity; they have abolished nearly all the\r\ndistinctions which antecedently existed between the two races. They\r\nhave permitted the negroes to sue, they have permitted them to\r\ntestify; they have not yet permitted them to vote.\r\n\r\n\"Why are they not received? Because, in the judgment of the Senate,\r\nbefore the States can be considered as restored, Congressional\r\nlegislation on the subject is necessary. Whose fault is it that there\r\nhas not been Congressional legislation? Is it the fault of the eleven\r\nStates? Certainly not; it is our own fault. And why is it that we are\r\nin point of fact delaying their admission, whether it is to be\r\nconsidered as a fault or not? Because we want to inquire into the\r\ncondition of these States. Why, in the name of Heaven! how long have\r\nwe been here? We came here early in December, and this is the month of\r\nApril; and here we may remain until July, or, as rumor has it, until\r\nnext December; and shall we be satisfied within that time that\r\nCongressional legislation may be safely adopted?\r\n\r\n\"I have a word or two more to say. My honorable friend from Illinois,\r\nas it seemed to me--his nature is impulsive, and perhaps he was\r\ncarried further than he intended--seemed to intimate that the\r\nPresident of the United States had not acted sincerely in this matter;\r\nthat his usurpation was a clear one, and that he was to be censured\r\nfor that usurpation. What has he done? He has vetoed this bill. He had\r\na constitutional right to do so. Not only that; if he believed that\r\nthe effect of the bill would be that which he states in his Veto\r\nMessage, he was not only authorized but bound to veto it. His oath is\r\nto 'preserve' as well as to 'protect and defend' the Constitution of\r\nthe United States; and believing, as he does, and in that opinion I\r\nconcur, that this bill assails the Constitution of the United States,\r\nhe would have been false to his plighted faith if he had not returned\r\nit with his objections.\r\n\r\n\"He desires--and who does not?--that the Union shall be restored as it\r\noriginally existed. He has a policy which he thinks is best calculated\r\nto effect it. He may be mistaken, but he is honest. Congress may\r\ndiffer with him. I hope they will agree sooner or later, because I\r\nbelieve, as I believe in my existence, that the condition in which the\r\ncountry now is can not remain without producing troubles that may\r\nshake our reputation, not only in our own eyes, but in the eyes of the\r\ncivilized world. Let the day come when we shall be again together, and\r\nthen, forgetting the past, hailing the present, and looking forward to\r\nthe future, we shall remember, if we remember the past at all, for the\r\nexhibition of valor and gallantry displayed on both sides, and find in\r\nit, when we become one, a guarantee that in the future no foreign\r\nhostilities are to be dreaded, and that no civil discord need be\r\napprehended.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull said: \"The opinion of Judge Curtis, from which the\r\nSenator read, was the opinion of a dissenting judge, entitled to very\r\ngreat credit on account of the learning and ability of that judge, but\r\nit was not the opinion of the court, and an examination of the entire\r\nopinion, which is very lengthy, would perhaps not sustain the precise\r\nprinciples the Senator from Maryland laid down. But, sir, I have\r\nanother authority which I think of equal weight with that of Judge\r\nCurtis--not pronounced in a judicial tribunal it is true, but by one\r\nof the most eminent members of the bar in this nation; I may say by a\r\ngentleman who stands at the head of the bar in America at this\r\ntime--an opinion pronounced, too, in the exercise of official duties;\r\nand I propose to read a few sentences from that opinion, for it is to\r\nbe found reported in the Congressional Globe containing the\r\nproceedings of this body less than ninety days ago. This is the\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n     \"'While they [negroes] were slaves, it was a very different\r\n     question; but now, when slavery is terminated, and by\r\n     terminating it you have got rid of the only obstacle in the\r\n     way of citizenship, two questions arise: first, Whether that\r\n     fact itself does not make them citizens? Before they were\r\n     not citizens, because of slavery, and only because of\r\n     slavery. Slavery abolished, why are they not just as much\r\n     citizens as they would have been had slavery never existed?\r\n     My opinion is that they become citizens, and I hold that\r\n     opinion so strongly that I should consider it unnecessary to\r\n     legislate on the subject at all, as far as that class is\r\n     concerned, but for the ruling of the Supreme Court, to which\r\n     I have adverted.'\r\n\r\n\"Sir, that opinion was held by the honorable Senator from Maryland who\r\nmade this speech to-day. He holds the opinion so strongly now that\r\nslavery is abolished, which was the only obstacle in the way of their\r\nbeing citizens, that he would want no legislation on the subject but\r\nfor the Dred Scott decision! What further did the Senator from\r\nMaryland say less than ninety days ago? It is possible, doubtless--it\r\nis not only possible but it is certainly true--that the Senator from\r\nMaryland, by reading the conclusive arguments of the Veto Message in\r\nregard to Chinese and Gypsies, has discovered that he was in error\r\nninety days ago. I by no means mean to impute any wrong motive to the\r\nSenator from Maryland, but simply to ask that he will pardon me if I\r\nhave not been able to see the conclusive reasoning of the Veto\r\nMessage.\"\r\n\r\nAfter quoting still further from Mr. Johnson's speech, made on a\r\nprevious occasion, Mr. Trumbull said: \"But as I am up, I will refer to\r\none other point to which the Senator alluded, and that is in regard to\r\nthe quotation which I made yesterday from the statute of 1790. I\r\nquoted that statute for the purpose of showing that the provisions in\r\nthe bill under consideration, which it was insisted allowed the\r\npunishment of ministerial officers and judges who should act in\r\nobedience to State laws and under color of State laws, were not\r\nanomalous. I read a statute of 1790 to show that the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, at that day, provided for punishing both judges and\r\nofficers who acted under color of State law in defiance of a law of\r\nthe United States. How does the Senator answer that? He says that was\r\non a different subject; the law of 1790 provided for punishing judges\r\nand officers who did an act in violation of the international law,\r\njurisdiction over which is conferred upon the nation. Let me ask the\r\nSenator from Maryland, if the bill under discussion does not provide\r\nfor the punishment of persons who violate a right secured by the\r\nConstitution of the United States? Is a right which a citizen holds by\r\nvirtue of the Constitution of his country less sacred than a right\r\nwhich he holds by virtue of international law?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson replied as follows: \"It is singular, in my estimation, how\r\na gentleman with a mind as clear as Mr. Trumbull's, with a\r\nperspicacity that is a little surprising, could have fallen into the\r\nerror of supposing that there is any inconsistency between the\r\ndoctrine contained in the speech to which he has adverted and the one\r\nwhich I have maintained to-day. What I said then I say now, that as\r\nfar as the United States are concerned, all persons born within the\r\nlimits of the United States are to be considered as citizens, and that\r\nwithout reference to the color or the race; and after the abolition of\r\nslavery the negro would stand precisely in the condition of the white\r\nman. But the honorable member can hardly fail, I think--certainly he\r\ncan not when I call his attention to it--to perceive that that has\r\nnothing to do with the question now before the Senate. His bill makes\r\nthem citizens of the United States because of birth, and gives them\r\ncertain rights within the States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden asked: \"Were not your remarks made on this very question\r\nin this bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mr. Johnson; \"on another bill.\" He continued: \"What I\r\nmaintain is this--and I have never doubted it, because I entertained\r\nthe same opinion when I made those remarks that I entertain now--that\r\ncitizenship of the United States, in consequence of birth, does not\r\nmake a party a citizen of the State in which he is born unless the\r\nConstitution and laws of the State recognize him as a citizen. Now,\r\nwhat does this bill propose? All born within the United States are to\r\nbe considered citizens of the United States, and as such shall have in\r\nevery State all the rights that belong to any body else in the State\r\nas far as the particular subjects stated in the bill are concerned.\r\nNow, I did suppose, and I shall continue to suppose, it to be clear,\r\nunless I am met with the almost paramount authority of the Chairman of\r\nthe Judiciary Committee, that citizenship, by way of birth, conferred\r\non the party as far as he and the United States were concerned, is not\r\na citizenship which entitles him to the privilege of citizenship\r\nwithin the State where he is born; if it be true, and I submit that it\r\nis true beyond all doubt, that over the question of State citizenship\r\nthe authority of the State Government is supreme.\r\n\r\n\"Now, the honorable member is confounding the _status_ of a citizen of\r\nthe United States and the _status_ of a citizen of the United States\r\nwho as such is a citizen of the State of his residence. Maintaining,\r\nas I do, that there is no authority to make any body a citizen of the\r\nUnited States so as to convert him thereby into a citizen of a State,\r\nthere is no authority in the Constitution for this particular bill,\r\nwhich says that because he is a citizen of the United States he is to\r\nbe considered a citizen of any State in which he may be at any time\r\nwith reference to the rights conferred by this bill.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull replied: \"I desire simply to remark that the speech from\r\nwhich I quoted, made by the Senator from Maryland, was made upon this\r\nvery bill. It was in reference to this bill that he was speaking when\r\nhe laid down the proposition that every person born in the United\r\nStates since the abolition of slavery was a citizen of the United\r\nStates, and if there was any doubt about it, it was proper for us to\r\ndeclare them so, and not only proper, but our duty to do so; and to\r\nmake the matter specific, the honorable Senator voted for this\r\nproposition, which I will now read, on the yeas and nays:\r\n\r\n     \"'All persons born in the United States, and not subject to\r\n     any foreign Power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby\r\n     declared to be citizens of the United States, without\r\n     distinction of color.'\r\n\r\n\"Upon the adoption of that proposition as an amendment, it not being\r\nin the bill as originally introduced, the Senator from Maryland, with\r\nthirty others, voted in the affirmative. So we have his high authority\r\nfor saying that all persons born in the United States, and not subject\r\nto any foreign Power, are citizens of the United States, exactly as it\r\nappears in this bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Yates, of Illinois, remarked: \"I remember very well that the\r\nSenator from Maryland offered an amendment to the Freedmen's Bureau\r\nBill to this effect: to strike out the words 'without distinction of\r\ncolor.' The Freedmen's Bureau Bill applied legislation by Congress to\r\nthe freedmen in the States and to the condition of the freedmen in the\r\nStates. It was legislation that affected the freedmen in the\r\nrebellious States. If I remember aright the Senator from Maryland\r\nmoved to strike out the words 'without distinction of color' in one\r\nsection of that bill, and for that motion he gave this reason:\r\nbecause, under the Constitution of the United States, as amended,\r\nabolishing slavery in all the States and Territories of the United\r\nStates, the freedmen occupied precisely the same position with any\r\nother citizen of the United States in any State or Territory. I\r\nunderstood him as taking the broad position, which I have maintained,\r\nand which Republican Senators have maintained, and which I think the\r\ncountry maintains, that under the Constitution, as amended, the\r\nfreedman occupies precisely the same position as any man born in any\r\nState or Territory of the United States; and that was the object, if I\r\nunderstood the Senator from Maryland, of his moving to amend the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau Bill by striking out the words 'without distinction\r\nof color.'\r\n\r\n\"I recognize the authority of the decisions quoted by the Senator from\r\nMaryland before the adoption of the amendment to the Constitution. The\r\nStates had the power over the question of slavery in the States before\r\nthe amendment to the Constitution; but by the amendment to the\r\nConstitution, in which the States have concurred, the freedman becomes\r\na free man, entitled to the same rights and privileges as any other\r\ncitizen of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania, spoke in favor of the veto, premising that\r\nhis words, \"if they are not to convince any body in the Senate, may go\r\nto the country and be reflected on there.\" Mr. Cowan said he was quite\r\nwilling that all the people of this country should enjoy the rights\r\nconferred upon them by this bill. But, supposing the bill had all the\r\nmerit in the world, it would not be effective to attain the ends hoped\r\nfor by its friends; and apart from that, its provisions were\r\nexceedingly dangerous. It gave married women and minors the right to\r\nmake and enforce contracts. The grammatical structure of a portion of\r\nthe bill was such as to enable a corrupt, passionate, or prejudiced\r\njudge to take advantage of it in order to widen the jurisdiction of\r\nthe United States courts, and drag into them all the business which\r\nhad heretofore occupied the State courts. This would be enough in this\r\nnineteenth century to make a man tremble for the fate of\r\nconstitutional government. \"If,\" said Mr. Cowan, \"we had undoubted\r\nauthority to pass this bill, under the circumstances I would not vote\r\nfor it, on account of its objectionable phraseology, its dubious\r\nlanguage, and the mischief which might attend upon a large and liberal\r\nconstruction of it in the District and Circuit Courts of the United\r\nStates.\" The trouble and expense of obtaining justice in the United\r\nStates courts, but one, or at most two existing in any of the Southern\r\nStates, would debar the African from applying to them for redress.\r\n\"Your remedy,\" said the Senator, \"is delusive; your remedy is no\r\nremedy at all; and to hold it up to the world as a remedy is a gross\r\nfraud, however pious it may be. It is no remedy to the poor debtor\r\nthat you prosecute his judge, and threaten him with fine and\r\nimprisonment. It is no remedy to the poor man with a small claim that\r\nyou locate a court one or two hundred miles away from him which is so\r\nexpensive in its administration of justice that he can not enter\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WM. M. Stewart, Senator from Nevada.]\r\n\r\n\"There is another provision of the bill, which, notwithstanding the\r\nact of Congress relied upon by the honorable Senator from Illinois, I\r\nthink is unquestionably anomalous, and to me not only anomalous, but\r\natrocious; and that is, the substitution of an indictment for the writ\r\nof error. What has been the law of these United States heretofore?\r\nWhen an act of Congress came in contact with a State law, and the\r\njudge of a State court decided that the law of Congress was\r\nunconstitutional, there was an appeal given to the debated party to\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States in order to determine the\r\nconstitutionality of the law. But, sir, who, until the last few\r\nmonths, ever heard of making the judge a criminal because he decided\r\nagainst the constitutionality of a law of the United States? One would\r\nthink we were being transported back to the dark ages of the world\r\nwhen a man is to be accused and perhaps convicted of a crime who has\r\ndone nothing more than honestly and conscientiously discharged his\r\nduty. I know that the persons of embassadors are sacred, and I know\r\nthat it is a very high offense against the law of nations, which no\r\ncivil judge of any court could justify, to invade this sacred right of\r\nthe embassador, but every body knows that that is an exceptional case.\r\nEvery body knows that in all times and at all ages the judge was\r\npunishable who did not respect the person of an embassador. But that\r\nis not this case. That analogy will not help the third section of this\r\nbill. It is openly avowed upon the floor of the Senate of the United\r\nStates, in the year of our Lord 1866, in the full blaze and light of\r\nthe nineteenth century, that the indictment is to be a substitute for\r\nthe writ of error, and it is justified because a judge ought to be\r\nindicted who violates the sacred person of an embassador! What potency\r\nthere must be in the recent amendment of the Constitution which has\r\nfoisted the negro and set him upon the same platform as the envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of Great Britain or of all\r\nthe Russias to the United States of America, and made him as sacred as\r\nan embassador, and the judge who decides against him is to be punished\r\nas a criminal!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stewart showed that States might easily avoid all the annoying\r\noperations of this bill which were feared by its opponents: \"When I\r\nreflect how very easy it is for the States to avoid the operation of\r\nthis bill, how very little they have to do to avoid the operation of\r\nthe bill entirely, I think that it is robbed of its coercive features,\r\nand I think no one has any reason to complain because Congress has\r\nexercised a power, which it must be conceded it has, when it has\r\nexercised it in a manner which leaves it so easy for the States to\r\navoid the operation of this bill. If passed to-day, it has no\r\noperation in the State of Georgia; it is impossible to commit a crime\r\nunder this bill in the State of Georgia; and the other States can\r\nplace themselves in the same position so easily that I do not believe\r\nthey ought to complain.\"\r\n\r\nHe then read the second section of an act passed in Georgia, precisely\r\nsimilar to the first section of the Civil Eights Bill. Nothing could\r\nbe done in Georgia under \"color of law,\" which would subject officers\r\nto the penalties provided by the Civil Rights Bill. \"It being so\r\neasily avoided by being complied with, by doing a simple act of\r\njustice, by carrying out the spirit of the constitutional amendment, I\r\ncan not give my consent to defeat a bill the purpose of which is good,\r\nthe operation of which is so innocent, and may be so easily avoided.\"\r\n\r\nThe Republican Senators were desirous of bringing the bill to a final\r\nvote on this evening, but on account of the illness of Senator Wright,\r\nof New Jersey, it was proposed by Democratic members to appoint some\r\nhour on the following day when the vote should be taken in order that\r\nthey might have a full vote.\r\n\r\nMr. Wade, of Ohio, said: \"If this was a question in the ordinary\r\ncourse of legislation, I certainly would not object to the proposition\r\nwhich the gentlemen on the other side make; but I view it as one of\r\nthe greatest and most fundamental questions that has ever come before\r\nthis body for settlement, and I look upon it as having bearings\r\naltogether beyond the question on this bill. The bill is, undoubtedly,\r\na very good one. There is no constitutional objection to it; there has\r\nbeen no objection to it raised that creates a doubt in the mind of any\r\nmortal man; but, nevertheless, we are at issue with the President of\r\nthe United States upon a question peculiarly our own. The President of\r\nthe United States has no more power under the Constitution to\r\ninterpose his authority here, to prescribe the principle upon which\r\nthese States should be admitted to this Union, than any man of this\r\nbody has out of it. The Constitution makes him the executive of the\r\nlaws that we make, and there it leaves him; and what is our condition?\r\nWe who are to judge of the forms of government under which States\r\nshall exist; we, who are the only power that is charged with this\r\ngreat question, are to be somehow or other wheedled out of it by the\r\nPresident by reason of the authority that he sets up.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we can not abandon it unless we yield to a principle that will\r\nunhinge and unsettle the balances of the Constitution itself. If the\r\nPresident of the United States can interpose his authority upon a\r\nquestion of this character, and can compel Congress to succumb to his\r\ndictation, he is an emperor, a despot, and not a President of the\r\nUnited States. Because I believe the great question of congressional\r\npower and authority is at stake here, I yield to no importunities of\r\nthe other side. I feel myself justified in taking every advantage\r\nwhich the Almighty has put into my hands to defend the power and\r\nauthority of this body, of which I claim to be a part. I will not\r\nyield to these appeals of comity on a question like this; but I will\r\ntell the President and every body else that, if God Almighty has\r\nstricken one member so that he can not be here to uphold the dictation\r\nof a despot, I thank him for his interposition, and I will take\r\nadvantage of it if I can.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McDougall, of California, replied to Mr. Wade. This wayward\r\nSenator from California has wide notoriety from his unhappy habits of\r\nintemperance. He has been described by a writer unfriendly to his\r\npolitics as \"the most brilliant man in the Senate; a man so\r\nwonderfully rich, that though he seeks to beggar himself in talents\r\nand opportunities, he has left a patrimony large enough to outdazzle\r\nmost of his colleagues.\" He frequently would enter the Senate-chamber\r\nin a condition of apparent stupor, unable to walk straight; and after\r\nlistening a few moments to what was going on, has arisen and spoken\r\nupon the pending question in words of great beauty and force.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Mr. McDougall is described as having been in a worse\r\ncondition than usual. His words were muttered rather than spoken, so\r\nthat only those immediately about him could hear; and yet his remarks\r\nwere termed by one of his auditors as \"one of the neatest little\r\nspeeches ever heard in the Senate.\" His remarks were as follows: \"The\r\nSenator from Ohio is in the habit of appealing to his God in\r\nvindication of his judgment and conduct; it is a common thing for him\r\nto do so; but in view of the present demonstration, it may well be\r\nasked who and what is his God. In the old Persian mythology there was\r\nan Ormudz and an Ahriman--a god of light and beauty, and a god of\r\ndarkness and death. The god of light sent the sun to shine, and gentle\r\nshowers to fructify the fields; the god of darkness sent the tornado,\r\nand the tempest, and the thunder, scathing with pestilence the\r\nnations. And in old Chaldean times men came to worship Ahriman, the\r\ngod of darkness, the god of pestilence and famine; and his priests\r\nbecame multitudinous; they swarmed the land; and when men prayed then\r\ntheir offerings were, 'We will not sow a field of grain, we will not\r\ndig a well, we will not plant a tree.' These were the offerings to the\r\ndark spirit of evil, until a prophet came who redeemed that ancient\r\nland; but he did it after crucifixion, like our great Master.\r\n\r\n\"The followers of Ahriman always appealed to the same spirit\r\nmanifested by the Senator from Ohio. Death is to be one of his angels\r\nnow to redeem the Constitution and the laws, and to establish liberty.\r\nSickness, suffering, evil, are to be his angels; and he thanks the\r\nAlmighty, his Almighty, that sickness, danger, and evil are about! It\r\nmay be a good god for him in this world; but if there is any truth in\r\nwhat we learn about the orders of religion in this Christian world,\r\nhis faith will not help him when he shall ascend up and ask entrance\r\nat the crystal doors. If there can be evil expressed in high places\r\nthat communicates evil thoughts, that communicates evil teachings,\r\nthat demoralizes the youth, who receive impressions as does the wax,\r\nit is by such lessons as the Senator from Ohio now teaches by word of\r\nmouth as Senator in this Senate hall.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the President of the United States is a constitutional officer,\r\nclothed with high power, and clothed with the very power which he has\r\nexercised in this instance; and those who conferred upon him these\r\npowers were men such as Madison, and Jay, and Hamilton, and Morris,\r\nand Washington, and a host of worthies; men who, I think, knew as much\r\nabout the laws of government, and how they should be rightly balanced,\r\nas any of the wisest who now sit here in council. It is the duty of\r\nthe President of the United States to stand as defender of the\r\nConstitution in his place as the conservator of the rights of the\r\npeople, as tribune of the people, as it was in old Rome when the\r\npeople did choose their tribunes to go into the senate-chamber among\r\nthe aristocracy of Rome, and when they passed laws injurious to the\r\nRoman people, to stand and say, 'I forbid it.'\r\n\r\n\"That is the veto power, incorporated wisely by our fathers in the\r\nConstitution, conferred upon the President of the United States, and\r\nto be treated with consideration; and no appeal of the Senator to his\r\nGod can change the Constitution or the rights of the President of the\r\nUnited States, or can prevent a just consideration of the dignity of\r\nthis Senate body by persons who have just consideration, who feel that\r\nthey are Senators.\r\n\r\n\"It is a strange thing, an exceedingly strange thing, that when a few\r\nSenators in the city of Washington, ill at their houses, give\r\nassurance that they can be here to act upon a great public question on\r\nthe day following this, we should hear a piece of declamation, the\r\nSenator appealing to his God, and saying, with an _Io triumphe_ air,\r\n'Well or ill, God has made them ill.' Sir, the god of desolation, the\r\ngod of darkness, the god of evil is his god. I never expected to hear\r\nsuch objections raised among honorable men; and men to be Senators\r\nshould be honorable men. I never expected to hear such things in this\r\nhall; and I rose simply to say that such sentiments were to be\r\ncondemned, and must receive my condemnation, now and here; and if it\r\namounts to a rebuke, I trust it may be a rebuke.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate adjourned, with the understanding that the vote should be\r\ntaken on the following day. In the morning hour on that day, as the\r\nStates were called for the purpose of giving Senators an opportunity\r\nof introducing petitions or resolutions, Mr. Lane, of Kansas,\r\npresented a joint resolution providing for admitting Senators and\r\nRepresentatives from the States lately in insurrection. This bill,\r\nemanating from a Republican Senator, who professed to have framed it\r\nas an embodiment of the President's policy, was evidently designed to\r\nhave an influence upon the action of the Senate upon the Civil Rights\r\nBill. It proposed that Senators and Representatives from the late\r\nrebellious States should be admitted into Congress whenever it should\r\nappear that they had annulled their ordinances of secession, ratified\r\nthe constitutional amendment abolishing slavery, repudiated all rebel\r\ndebts, recognized the debts of the United States, and extended the\r\nelective franchise to all male persons of color residing in the State,\r\nover twenty-one years of age, who can read and write, and who own real\r\nestate valued at not less than two hundred and fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nAs a reason for introducing this measure, Mr. Lane, of Kansas,\r\nremarked: \"I have been laboring for months to harmonize the President\r\nof the United States with the majority on the floor of Congress. I\r\nthought yesterday that there was a hope of securing such a result. It\r\ndid seem that some of the members of this body were disposed to\r\nharmonize with the President. I proposed to go very far yesterday to\r\nsecure that harmony. But while pursuing this course, we were awakened\r\nby one of the most vindictive assaults ever made upon any official, by\r\neither friend or opponent, from the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Wade]--an\r\nassault upon my personal friend, a man who for two years sat side by\r\nside with me here, whom I learned to respect and admire for his pluck,\r\nhis ability, and integrity, and to love for his manly virtues; a man\r\nwhom I originally selected as the candidate of the Republican party\r\nfor the second office within the gift of that party; a man whom I\r\nurged on the Republican convention at Baltimore as their candidate; a\r\nman whose election I did my utmost to secure against the efforts of\r\nthe Senator from Ohio. In the most critical moment of that political\r\ncampaign, an assault was made on our presidential candidate in the\r\nsame spirit evinced by him yesterday in his attack upon the President.\r\nI defended the candidate of the Republican party against that assault,\r\nand I defend the President of the Republican party against the assault\r\nof yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"'A despot!' 'A dictator!' In what? In seeking to reconstruct the\r\nrebellious States in violation of the wishes of the Congress of the\r\nUnited States? When Mr. Johnson took his seat in the presidential\r\nchair, I ask you, sir, what had Congress done? The people of the\r\nUnited States had done this: Mr. Lincoln had marked out the policy of\r\nreconstruction, since adopted by Mr. Johnson, and the people of the\r\nUnited States, the party to which the Senator from Ohio and myself\r\nbelong, indorsed by triumphant majorities that very reconstruction\r\npolicy. A despot for proposing, in violation of the wishes of the\r\nCongress of the United States, to reconstruct the insurrectionary\r\nStates upon the theory expressed in that joint resolution annulling\r\nthe ordinances of secession, ratifying the amendment to the\r\nConstitution abolishing slavery, repudiating the Confederate debt,\r\nindorsing the national debt, and extending suffrage to all colored men\r\nwho can read the Constitution of the United States and sign their\r\nnames, and to all colored men owning and paying taxes upon $250 worth\r\nof property!\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, I am not as conversant with the constituency of the\r\nSenator from Ohio as he is, but I venture the assertion that outside\r\nof New England there is not a single Northern State in this Union but\r\nwill by a majority vote to indorse the policy of reconstruction\r\nadvised by President Johnson and expressed in that joint resolution.\r\nYou can not carry before the people of this country suffrage to the\r\nunqualified black man. You can not find a State in this Union outside\r\nof New England, in my judgment, that will indorse that policy.\r\nRestrict it to a qualification clause, as the President of the United\r\nStates recommends, and you can carry the Republican Union party\r\nevery-where, and with unanimity.\r\n\r\n\"The President of the United States 'a despot' for exercising a\r\nconstitutional right in vetoing a bill passed by Congress! Mr.\r\nPresident, had the Senator from Ohio occupied the position which is\r\noccupied by President Johnson, in my judgment, he would have vetoed\r\nthe Civil Rights Bill. 'A despot!' What is the exercise of the veto\r\npower? It amounts merely to a vote to reconsider, with the lights\r\ngiven in his reasons for the veto. When before has the exercise of a\r\nconstitutional right justified a political friend of the President of\r\nthe United States in denouncing that President as a despot and a\r\ndictator? He has been and is now, in my judgment, as anxious to\r\nharmonize the difficulties in the Union party as any Senator upon this\r\nfloor. If he was met in the same spirit, that party would be reunited\r\nand this Union would be restored. His advances are met by insult; his\r\nadvances are met by denunciation from the leader of the Republican\r\nparty upon this floor in language without a parallel. Mr. President,\r\nso far as I am concerned, I propose to-day and hereafter to take my\r\nposition alongside the President of the Republican party, and stand\r\nthere unflinchingly so long as he remains faithful to the principles\r\nof that party, defending him against the Senator from Ohio as I\r\ndefended his predecessor against the same Senator.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lane then expressed his desire that his proposition should lie\r\nupon the table and be printed. An order having been entered to that\r\neffect, Mr. Wade addressed the Senate. He remarked: \"It is said I made\r\nan attack on the President of the United States. As a Senator upon\r\nthis floor, I care no more about the opinions of the President of the\r\nUnited States than I do about those of any respectable Senator upon\r\nthis floor, or any Senator on this floor. Who is your President, that\r\nevery man must bow to his opinion? Why, sir, we all know him; he is no\r\nstranger to this body. We have measured him; we know his height, his\r\ndepth, his length, his breadth, his capacity, and all about him. Do\r\nyou set him up as a paragon and declare here on the floor of this\r\nSenate that you are going to make us all bow down before him? Is that\r\nthe idea? You [to Mr. Lane, of Kansas,] are going to be his apologist\r\nand defender in whatever he may propose to do! Is that the\r\nunderstanding of the Senator from Kansas?\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe that his constituents will be quite satisfied with\r\nso broad a declaration, that he is to wear any man's collar, and\r\nfollow him wherever he may go. Did I use harsh language toward the\r\nPresident yesterday? All that I said I stand by to-day and forever.\r\nWhat was the question upon which I made those observations, and what\r\nhas been the opinion of the President heretofore? what has been his\r\naction since? Here are three million people, our friends, friends to\r\nthe Government, who generously came forward in its difficulty, and\r\nhelped us throughout the war, sacrificed their blood and their lives\r\nto maintain the issue on our side, and who were faithful beyond all\r\nmen that were ever faithful before, to us during the whole of the\r\ndifficulty, every-where assisting our brave soldiers in the field,\r\nlaying down their lives to maintain our principles, and ministering in\r\nevery way to the misfortunes of our brave men whenever they fell into\r\nthe hands of those worse than savages with whom we were warring; and\r\nnow these men are laboring, are under one of the most frightful\r\ndespotisms that ever settled down upon the heads of mankind. Three\r\nmillion people are exposed to the outrages, the insolence, the murder\r\nof those worse than savages, their former masters, murdered as we hear\r\nevery day, oppressed every-where, their rights taken away, their\r\nmanhood trampled under foot; and Congress, under the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, endeavors to extend to them some little protection,\r\nand how are we met here? Every attempt of your Moses has been to\r\ntrample them down worse, and to throw every obstruction in the way of\r\nany relief that could be proposed by Congress. He has from all\r\nappearances become their inveterate and relentless foe, making violent\r\nwar upon any member of Congress who dares raise his voice or give his\r\nvote in favor of any measure having for its object the amelioration of\r\nthe condition of these poor people. Talk to me about the President\r\nbeing their friend! When did it ever happen before that a great\r\nmeasure of relief to suffering humanity on as broad a scale as this\r\nwas met by the stern veto of the President of the United States, and\r\nwithout being able when he undertakes to make his obstruction to our\r\nmeasures to designate a single clause of the Constitution that he\r\npretends has been violated.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday what was the issue? I was charged with great cruelty on\r\nthis floor, because I was unwilling to wait for recruits to be brought\r\nin here for the purpose of overthrowing the ground we had taken upon\r\nthis important question whether these poor people shall have relief or\r\nnot. Now, I wish to say that I am willing to extend courtesy to our\r\nold associates on this floor under other circumstances; but when you\r\nextend this kind of courtesy to them, the result is death and\r\ndestruction to three million people, trampled under the feet of their\r\nformer masters. My courtesy is extended to those poor men, and I would\r\nnot wait a moment that their enemies may be brought in here in order\r\nto prevent our doing any thing for their relief, joining with the\r\nPresident, who is determined, if we may judge by his acts, that no\r\nmeasure having for its object any relief shall be extended to them.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear the fact stated here the other day, that bills were\r\ndrawn with a view to escape the anathemas of your President, and were\r\nexhibited to him, and he asked 'if he had any objection to them to\r\nlook them over well, because if we can, consistent with the object\r\naimed at, make them clear of any objection you may have, we will do\r\nit?'\r\n\r\n\"I said, sir, that he seemed to have meditated a controversy with\r\nCongress from the beginning, and he has. He has treated our majorities\r\nas hostile to the people; two thirds of both branches of Congress have\r\nbeen treated by him as mere factionists, disunionists, enemies to the\r\ncountry, bent upon its destruction, bargaining with the enemy to\r\ndestroy the Government. This is the way the President has treated\r\nCongress, and every bill they have passed, which promised any relief\r\nto the men whom we are bound to protect, has been trampled under the\r\nExecutive heel; and even when members of this body did what I say they\r\nought not to have done--for I do not approve of my brother Trumbull's\r\ngoing up to the President, when he has a measure pending here as a\r\nSenator, to ask the President, in the first place, whether he will\r\napprove of it or not; even when he was asked if he objected to this\r\nmeasure, and made no objection, he still undertakes to veto it.\r\n\r\n\"If Congress should recede from the position they have taken to claim\r\njurisdiction over this great question of reädmitting these States,\r\nfrom that hour they surrender all the power that the Constitution\r\nplaces in their hands and that they were sworn to support, and they\r\nare the mere slaves of an accidental Executive; of a man who formerly\r\nassociated with us upon this floor; who was no more infallible than\r\nthe rest of us poor mortals; and yet the moment, by death or accident,\r\nhe is placed in the executive chair, it would seem as if some Senators\r\nbelieved him to be endowed with superhuman wisdom, and ought to be\r\ninvested with all the powers of this Government; that Congress ought\r\nto get on their knees before him, and take his insults and his\r\ndictation without resentment and without even an attempt to resist.\r\nSome States may send such instrumentalities here, but God knows some\r\nwill not; and I pity those that do, for they would hold their freedom\r\non a very uncertain tenure.\r\n\r\n\"Some gentlemen may be patient under the charge of treason, perhaps\r\nthe more so because treason is becoming popular in this day; but, sir,\r\nI am a little too old-fashioned to be charged by the executive branch\r\nof this Government as a traitor on the floor of Congress, and not\r\nresent it. I do not care whether he be King or President that\r\ninsinuates that I am a disunionist or traitor, standing upon the same\r\ninfamous platform with the traitors of the South; I will not take it\r\nfrom any mortal man, high or low, without repelling the charge. If any\r\nman here is tame enough to do it, he is too tame to be the Senator of\r\na proud-spirited people, conscious of their own freedom. I claim to be\r\ntheir representative, and they will censure me if they do not like my\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Mr. President, I wish to make an appeal to those great,\r\npatriotic statesmen on this floor, who, by their love of principle, by\r\ntheir unswerving honesty, unseduced by the blandishments of executive\r\npower, unawed by threats of violence, stand here to defend the rights\r\nof the people upon this floor, and will stand here forever. I say to\r\nyou Senators, we, the majority who are stigmatized as traitors, are\r\nthe only barrier to-day between this nation and anarchy and despotism.\r\nIf we give way, the hope of this nation is lost by the recreancy--yea,\r\nsir, I will say the treachery--of a man who betrayed our confidence,\r\ngot into power, and has gone into the camp of the enemy, and joined\r\nthose who never breathed a breath of principle in common with us.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lane replied: \"I stated that the party to which I belong nominated\r\nthe present President of the United States and elected him, and that\r\nas long as he fought within our lines and remained in our party, I\r\nwould endeavor to defend him upon this floor against all unjust\r\nassaults. After making that statement, the Senator from Ohio,\r\nforgetting the position he occupies, has suggested that I have taken\r\nupon myself the collar of the President of the United States. I hurl\r\nthe suggestion in the teeth of the Senator from Ohio as unworthy a\r\nSenator. I wear a collar! The pro-slavery party of the United States,\r\nbacked by a Democratic Administration, sustained and supported by the\r\narmy of the United States, could not fasten a collar upon the handful\r\nof Kansas squatters of whom I had the honor to be the leader. The\r\ngallant fight made in this Senate-chamber by the Senator from Ohio,\r\naided by the Senators from Massachusetts and other Senators, would\r\nhave been of but little avail had it not been for that other fight\r\nthat was made upon the prairies of Kansas under the lead of your\r\nhumble speaker. I wear a collar! Indicted for treason by a pro-slavery\r\ngrand jury, hunted from State to State by a writ founded upon that\r\nindictment for treason, and $100,000 offered for my head! Jim Lane\r\nwear a collar! Wherever he is known, that charge will be denounced as\r\nfalse by both friends and enemies.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brown, of Missouri, made a short speech, in which he set forth the\r\nposition of Mr. Lane, of Kansas, on questions previously before the\r\nSenate, showing their inconsistency with some of his recent remarks.\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle next delivered a speech, in the course of which he\r\ncalled attention to a bill which he had drawn \"to provide appropriate\r\nlegislation to enforce article thirteen of the Amendments to the\r\nConstitution, abolishing slavery in the United States.\" His object in\r\npresenting this bill was to \"avoid the objections raised by men not\r\nonly in this body, but in the other house, and the objections raised\r\nby the President of the United States, to the bill now pending.\"\r\n\r\nHe endeavored to explain his position and changes of opinion upon the\r\nCivil Rights: \"While this measure was upon its passage, I took no part\r\nin its discussion except upon a single point in relation to the Indian\r\ntribes. The bill passed, and the final vote was taken when I was not\r\npresent in the Senate; but it was not under such circumstances that,\r\nhad I been here, I should not have voted for the bill. I have no doubt\r\nthat if I had been present I should have voted for it. My attention\r\nwas not drawn very earnestly to the consideration of all the\r\nprovisions of this bill until the bill had passed from Senate and had\r\ngone to the House of Representatives, when the speeches of Mr.\r\nBingham, of Ohio, and of Mr. Delano, of Ohio, both able and\r\ndistinguished lawyers of that State, arrested my attention and called\r\nme very carefully to the consideration of the great questions which\r\nare involved in the bill. The bill was passed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives; it went to the President. From the fact that it was\r\nnot signed and returned to this body at once, and from all I heard, I\r\nbecame satisfied that, at least, if the bill was not to be returned\r\nwith objections, it was being withheld for most earnest and serious\r\nconsideration by the Executive.\r\n\r\n\"Then, Mr. President, it was, in view of all that had occurred, what\r\nhad been said by gentlemen in whom I had the utmost--I may say\r\nunbounded--confidence, that I began to look into this measure and to\r\nstudy it for myself. It is not my purpose now to go into a discussion\r\nof the provisions of this bill any further than to say that there are\r\nprovisions in it upon which the judgments of the best patriots, the\r\nbest jurists, the most earnest men disagree. There are men, in whom I\r\nhave entire confidence, who maintain that all its provisions are\r\nwithin the purview of the Constitution; there are others in whom I\r\nhave confidence, and equal confidence, who maintain directly the\r\ncontrary; and this has brought me seriously to consider whether there\r\nbe no common ground upon which friends can stand and stand together.\r\nSir, I may have failed to find it; but if I have, it is not because I\r\nhave not most earnestly sought for it with some days of study and most\r\nearnest reflection. I have endeavored to put upon paper what I believe\r\nwould carry this constitutional provision into effect and yet would be\r\na common ground on which we could unite without violating the\r\nconscientious convictions of any.\"\r\n\r\nIn concluding his remarks, Mr. Doolittle referred to instructions\r\nreceived by him from the Legislature of Wisconsin: \"Mr. President, I\r\nhave received, in connection with my colleague, a telegraphic dispatch\r\nfrom the Governor of the State of Wisconsin, which I have no doubt is\r\ncorrect, although I have not seen the resolution which is said to have\r\nbeen passed by the Legislature, in which it is stated that the\r\nLegislature has passed a resolution instructing the Senators in\r\nCongress from Wisconsin to vote for the passage of the Senate bill\r\ncommonly known as the Civil Rights Bill, the veto of the President to\r\nthe contrary notwithstanding. I have already stated, from my\r\nstand-point, the reasons why, in my judgment, I can not do it; I have\r\nstated them freely and frankly, and, as a matter of course, I expect\r\nto abide the consequences. I know that it has sometimes been said to\r\nme, by those, too, in whom I would have confidence, that for me, under\r\ncircumstances like these, not to follow the instructions of the\r\nLegislature of my State, would be to terminate my political life. Sir,\r\nbe it so. I never held or aspired to any other office politically than\r\nthe one I now hold; and God knows, if I know my own heart, if I can\r\nsee this Union restored after this gigantic war which has put down the\r\nrebellion, and to which I have lent my support, I shall be satisfied.\r\nI do not desire to remain in political life beyond that hour. There is\r\nnothing in that which will have the slightest influence whatever upon\r\nme. The duty which I owe to myself, the duty which I owe to the\r\ncountry, the duty which I owe to the union of these States, and the\r\npreservation of the rights of the States, and the duty which I owe to\r\nthe great Republican party, which I would still desire to save,\r\nprompts me to pursue the course which I now do.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Garrett Davis, of Kentucky, addressed the Senate in a long speech,\r\nof which the following is the closing paragraph: \"Public justice is\r\noften slow, but generally sure. Think you that the people will look on\r\nwith folded arms and stolid indifference and see you subvert their\r\nConstitution and liberties, and on their ruins erect a grinding\r\ndespotism. No; erelong they will rise up with earthquake force and\r\nfling you from power and place. I commend to your serious meditation\r\nthese words: 'Go tell Sylla that you saw Caius Marius sitting upon the\r\nruins of Carthage!'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Saulsbury thought a revolution would result from the passage of\r\nthis bill: \"In my judgment the passage of this bill is the\r\ninauguration of revolution--bloodless, as yet, but the attempt to\r\nexecute it by the machinery and in the mode provided in the bill will\r\nlead to revolution in blood. It is well that the American people\r\nshould take warning in time and set their house in order, but it is\r\nutterly impossible that the people of this country will patiently\r\nentertain and submit to this great wrong. I do not say this because I\r\nwant a revolution; Heaven knows we have had enough of bloodshed; we\r\nhave had enough of strife; there has been enough of mourning in every\r\nhousehold; there are too many new-made graves on which the grass has\r\nnot yet grown for any one to wish to see the renewal of strife; but,\r\nsir, attempt to execute this act within the limits of the States of\r\nthis Union, and, in my judgment, this country will again be plunged\r\ninto all the horrors of civil war.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McDougall said: \"I agree with the Senator from Delaware that this\r\nmeasure is revolutionary in its character. The majority glory in their\r\ngiant power, but they ought to understand that it is tyrannous to\r\nexercise that power like a giant. A revolution now is moving onward;\r\nit has its center in the North-east. A spirit has been radiating out\r\nfrom there for years past as revolutionary as the spirit that went out\r\nfrom Charleston, South Carolina, and perhaps its consequences will be\r\nequally fatal, for when that revolutionary struggle comes it will not\r\nbe a war between the North and its power and the slaveholding\r\npopulation of the South; it will be among the North men themselves,\r\nthey who have lived under the shadows of great oaks, and seen the tall\r\npine-trees bend.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the remarks by the Senator from California, the\r\nvote was taken, with the following result;\r\n\r\n     YEAS--Messrs. Anthony, Brown, Chandler, Clark, Conness,\r\n     Cragin, Creswell, Edmunds, Fessenden, Foster, Grimes,\r\n     Harris, Henderson, Howard, Howe, Kirkwood, Lane of Indiana,\r\n     Morgan, Morrill, Nye, Poland, Pomeroy, Ramsey, Sherman,\r\n     Sprague, Stewart, Sumner, Trumbull, Wade, Willey, Williams,\r\n     Wilson, and Yates--33.\r\n\r\n     NAYS--Messrs.

The bill and the President's Veto Message having been\r\nread, Mr. Wilson, of Iowa, demanded the previous question on the\r\npassage of the bill, the objections of the President to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding, and gave his reasons for so doing: \"Mr. Speaker, the\r\ndebate which occurred on this bill occupied two weeks of the time of\r\nthis House. Some forty speeches were made, and the debate was not\r\nbrought to a close until all had been heard who expressed a desire to\r\nspeak upon the bill. At the close of that debate, the bill was passed\r\nby more than two-thirds of this House. It has been returned to us with\r\nthe objections of the President to its becoming a law. I do not\r\npropose to reöpen the discussion of this measure; I am disposed to\r\nleave the close of this debate to the President by the message which\r\nhas just been read. I ask the friends of this great measure to answer\r\nthe argument and statements of that message by their votes.\"\r\n\r\nThe vote was finally taken on the question, \"Shall this bill pass,\r\nnotwithstanding the objections of the President?\" The following is the\r\nrecord of the vote:\r\n\r\n     YEAS--Messrs.

Two-thirds of the House having, upon this\r\nreconsideration, agreed to the passage of the bill, and it being\r\ncertified officially that a similar majority of the Senate, in which\r\nthe bill originated, also agreed to its passage, I do, therefore, by\r\nthe authority of the Constitution of the United States, declare that\r\nthis bill, entitled 'An act to protect all persons in the United\r\nStates in their civil rights, and furnish the means of their\r\nvindication,' has become a law.\"\r\n\r\nThis announcement was followed by prolonged applause on the floor of\r\nthe House and among the throng of spectators in the galleries.\r\n\r\nThe following is the form in which the great measure so long pending\r\nbecame a law of the land:\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives\r\n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled_, That\r\n     all persons born in the United States and not subject to any\r\n     foreign Power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby\r\n     declared to be citizens of the United States; and such\r\n     citizens of every race and color, without regard to any\r\n     previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude,\r\n     except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall\r\n     have been duly convicted, shall have the same right in every\r\n     State and Territory in the United States to make and enforce\r\n     contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to\r\n     inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and\r\n     personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws\r\n     and proceedings for the security of person and property as\r\n     is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like\r\n     punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other, any\r\n     law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom to the\r\n     contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That any person who,\r\n     under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or\r\n     custom, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any\r\n     inhabitant of any State or Territory to the deprivation of\r\n     any right secured or protected by this act, or to different\r\n     punishment, pains, or penalties on account of such person\r\n     having at any time been held in a condition of slavery or\r\n     involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime\r\n     whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, or by\r\n     reason of his color or race, than is prescribed for the\r\n     punishment of white persons, shall be deemed guilty of a\r\n     misdemeanor, and, on conviction, shall be punished by a fine\r\n     not exceeding $1,000, or imprisonment not exceeding one\r\n     year, or both, in the discretion of the court.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3. _And be it further enacted_, That the district\r\n     courts of the United States, within their respective\r\n     districts, shall have, exclusively of the courts of the\r\n     several States, cognizance of all crimes and offenses\r\n     committed against the provisions of this act, and also,\r\n     concurrently with the circuit courts of the United States,\r\n     of all causes, civil and criminal, affecting persons who are\r\n     denied or can not enforce in the courts or judicial\r\n     tribunals of the State or locality where they may be, any of\r\n     the rights secured to them by the first section of this act;\r\n     and if any suit or prosecution, civil or criminal, has been\r\n     or shall be commenced in any State court against any such\r\n     person, for any cause whatsoever, or against any officer,\r\n     civil or military, or other person, for any arrest or\r\n     imprisonment, trespasses or wrongs, done or committed by\r\n     virtue or under color of authority derived from this act or\r\n     the act establishing a Bureau for the Relief of Freedmen and\r\n     Refugees, and all acts amendatory thereof, or for refusing\r\n     to do any act upon the ground that it would be inconsistent\r\n     with this act, such defendant shall have the right to remove\r\n     such cause for trial to the proper district or circuit court\r\n     in the manner prescribed by the 'Act relating to _habeas\r\n     corpus_ and regulating judicial proceedings in certain\r\n     cases,' approved March 3, 1863, and all acts amendatory\r\n     thereof.

The disposition of the President, now plainly apparent, to\r\noppose all legislation which the party that had elevated him to office\r\nmight consider appropriate to the condition of the rebel States, the\r\nmajority in Congress discovered that, if they would make progress in\r\nthe work before them, they must be content to do without Executive\r\napproval. The defection of the President from the principles of the\r\nparty which had elected him, so far from dividing and destroying that\r\nparty, had rather given it consolidation and strength. After the veto\r\nof the Civil Rights Bill, a very few members of the Senate and House\r\nof Representatives who had been elected as Republicans adhered to the\r\nPresident, but the most of those who had wavered stepped forward into\r\nthe ranks of the \"Radicals,\" as they were called, and a firm and\r\ninvincible \"two-thirds\" moved forward to consummate legislation which\r\nthey deemed essential to the interests of the nation.\r\n\r\nSo fully convinced were the majority that some effective legislation\r\nfor the freedmen should be consummated, that two days after the final\r\nvote in which the former bill failed to pass over the veto, Senator\r\nWilson introduced a bill \"to continue in force the Bureau for the\r\nrelief of Freedmen and Refugees,\" which was read twice and referred to\r\nthe Committee on Military Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe bill, however, which subsequently became a law, originated in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. In that branch of Congress was a Special\r\nCommittee on the Freedmen, who were able to give more immediate and\r\ncontinuous attention to that class of people than could committees\r\nsuch as those of the Judiciary and Military Affairs, having many other\r\nsubjects to consider.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Freedmen, having given much time and attention to\r\nthe perfection of a measure to meet the necessities of the case, on\r\nthe 22d of May reported through their chairman, Mr. Eliot, \"A bill to\r\ncontinue in force and amend an act entitled 'an act to establish a\r\nBureau for the relief of Freedmen and Refugees, and for other\r\npurposes.'\"\r\n\r\nThis bill provided for keeping in force the Freedmen's Bureau then in\r\nexistence for two years longer. Some of the features to which the\r\nPresident had objected in his veto of the former bill had been\r\nmodified and in part removed. In providing for the education of\r\nfreedmen, the commissioner was restricted to cooperating so far with\r\nthe charitable people of the country as to furnish rooms for\r\nschool-houses and protection to teachers. The freedmen's courts were\r\nto be kept in existence till State legislation should conform itself\r\nto the Civil Rights Bill, and the disturbed relations of the States to\r\nthe Union were restored. The President was required to reserve from\r\nsale public lands, not exceeding in all one million of acres, in\r\nArkansas, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana, to be assigned\r\nin parcels of forty acres and less to loyal refugees and freedmen.\r\n\r\nOne week after the introduction of the bill, its consideration was\r\nresumed. The question was taken without debate, and the bill passed by\r\na vote of ninety-six in favor and thirty-two against the measure.\r\nFifty-five members failed to vote.\r\n\r\nOn the day following, May 30th, the clerk of the House conveyed the\r\nbill to the Senate. It was there referred to the Committee on Military\r\nAffairs, as that committee already had before them seven bills\r\nrelating to the same subject. Nearly a fortnight subsequently, the\r\ncommittee reported back to the Senate the House bill with certain\r\namendments. The report of the committee, and the amendments proposed\r\ntherein, could not be considered in the Senate until the lapse of\r\nanother fortnight. On the 26th of June, the amendments devised by the\r\ncommittee were read in the Senate and adopted. Mr. Davis made a number\r\nof attempts to have the bill laid on the table or deferred to a\r\nsubsequent day, but without success. Mr. Hendricks and Mr. Buckalew\r\nmade ineffectual attempts to amend the bill by proposing to strike out\r\nimportant sections.\r\n\r\nThe Senate indulged in but little discussion of the bill or the\r\namendments. The bill as amended finally passed the Senate by a vote of\r\ntwenty-six for and six against the measure. The bill then went to the\r\nHouse for the concurrence of that body in the amendments passed by the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Freedmen made a report, which was adopted by the\r\nHouse, to non-concur in the amendments of the Senate. A Committee of\r\nConference was appointed on the part of the Senate and the House.\r\nThey, after consultation, made a report by which the Senate\r\namendments, with some modifications, were adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. Eliot, Chairman of the Committee on the Freedmen, and of the\r\nCommittee of Conference on the part of the House, at the request of a\r\nmember, thus explained the amendments proposed by the Senate: \"The\r\nfirst amendment which the Senate made to the bill, as it was passed by\r\nthe House, was simply an enlargement of one of the sections of the\r\nHouse bill, which provided that the volunteer medical officers engaged\r\nin the medical department of the bureau might be continued, inasmuch\r\nas it was expected that the medical force of the regular army would be\r\nspeedily reduced to the minimum, and in that case all the regular\r\nofficers would be wanted in the service. It was therefore thought\r\nright that there should be some force connected with the Bureau of\r\nRefugees and Freedmen. The Senate enlarged the provisions of the House\r\nbill by providing that officers of the volunteer service now on duty\r\nmight be continued as assistant commissioners and other officers, and\r\nthat the Secretary of War might fill vacancies until other officers\r\ncould be detailed from the regular army. That is the substance of the\r\nfirst material amendment.\r\n\r\n\"The next amendment strikes out a portion of one of the sections of\r\nthe House bill, which related to the officers who serve as medical\r\nofficers of the bureau, because it was provided for in the amendment\r\nto which I have just referred.\r\n\r\n\"The next amendment strikes out from the House bill the section which\r\nset apart, reserved from sale, a million acres of land in the Gulf\r\nStates. It may perhaps be recollected that when the bill was reported\r\nfrom the committee, I stated that, in case the bill which the House\r\nhad then passed, and which was known as the Homestead Bill, and which\r\nwas then before the Senate, should become a law, this section of the\r\nbill would not be wanted. The bill referred to has become a law, and\r\nthis section five, providing for that reservation, has, therefore,\r\nbeen stricken from the bill.\r\n\r\n\"The next amendment made by the Senate was to strike out a section of\r\nthe House bill which simply provided that upon application for\r\nrestoration by the former owners of the land assigned under General\r\nSherman's field order, the application should not be complied with.\r\nThat section is stricken out and another substituted for it, which\r\nprovides that certain lands which are now owned by the United States,\r\nhaving been purchased by the United States under tax commissioners'\r\nsales, shall be assigned in lots of twenty acres to freedmen who have\r\nhad allotments under General Sherman's field order, at the price for\r\nwhich the lands were purchased by the United States; and not only that\r\nthose freedmen should have such allotments, but that other freedmen\r\nwho had had lots assigned to them under General Sherman's field order,\r\nand who may have become dispossessed of their land, should have\r\nassignments made to them of these lands belonging to the United\r\nStates. I think the justice of that provision will strike every one.\r\nAnd it will be perhaps a merit in the eyes of many that it does not\r\ncall upon the Treasury for the expenditure of any money. In the bill\r\nwhich was passed by the House, it will be recollected that there was a\r\nprovision under which there should be purchased by the commissioner of\r\nthe bureau enough public lands to be substituted for the lands at\r\nfirst assigned to freedmen. Instead of that, provision is made by\r\nwhich they can have property belonging to the United States which has\r\ncome into its possession under tax sales, and where the titles have\r\nbeen made perfect by lapse of time.\r\n\r\n\"The next amendment of the Senate provides that certain lands which\r\nwere purchased by the United States at tax sales, and which are now\r\nheld by the United States, should be sold at prices not less than ten\r\ndollars an acre, and that the proceeds should be invested for the\r\nsupport of schools, without distinction of color or race, on the\r\nislands in the parishes of St. Helena and St. Luke. That is all the\r\nprovision which was made for education.\r\n\r\n\"The only other material amendment made by the Senate gives to the\r\ncommissioner of the bureau power to take property of the late\r\nConfederate States, held by them or in trust for them, and which is\r\nnow in charge of the commissioner of the bureau, to take that property\r\nand devote it to educational purposes. The amendment further provides\r\nthat when the bureau shall cease to by the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States of America in exist, such of the\r\nlate so-called Confederate States as shall have made provision for\r\neducation, without regard to color, should have the balance of money\r\nremaining on hand, to be divided among them in proportion to their\r\npopulation.\"\r\n\r\nThe vote followed soon after the remarks of Mr. Eliot, and the bill,\r\nas amended, passed the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe following is the bill as it went to the President for his\r\napproval:\r\n\r\n     \"AN ACT to continue in force and to amend 'An Act to\r\n     establish a Bureau for the relief of Freedmen and Refugees,'\r\n     and for other purposes.\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives\r\n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled_, That\r\n     the act to establish a bureau for the relief of freedmen and\r\n     refugees, approved March third, eighteen hundred and\r\n     sixty-five, shall continue in force for the term of two\r\n     years from and after the passage of this act.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That the supervision\r\n     and care of said bureau shall extend to all loyal refugees\r\n     and freedmen, so far as the same shall be necessary, to\r\n     enable them, as speedily as practicable, to become\r\n     self-supporting citizens of the United States, and to aid\r\n     them in making the freedom conferred by proclamation of the\r\n     commander-in-chief, by emancipation under the laws of\r\n     States, and by constitutional amendment, available to them\r\n     and beneficial to the republic.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3. _And be it further enacted_, That the President\r\n     shall, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\n     appoint two assistant commissioners, in addition to those\r\n     authorized by the act to which this is an amendment, who\r\n     shall give like bonds and receive the same annual salaries\r\n     provided in said act; and each of the assistant\r\n     commissioners of the bureau shall have charge of one\r\n     district containing such refugees or freedmen, to be\r\n     assigned him by the commissioner, with the approval of the\r\n     President. And the commissioner shall, under the direction\r\n     of the President, and so far as the same shall be, in his\r\n     judgment, necessary for the efficient and economical\r\n     administration of the affairs of the bureau, appoint such\r\n     agents, clerks, and assistants as may be required for the\r\n     proper conduct of the bureau. Military officers or enlisted\r\n     men may be detailed for service and assigned to duty under\r\n     this act; and the President may, if, in his judgment, safe\r\n     and judicious so to do, detail from the army all the\r\n     officers and agents of this bureau; but no officer so\r\n     assigned shall have increase of pay or allowances. Each\r\n     agent or clerk, not heretofore authorized by law, not being\r\n     a military officer, shall have an annual salary of not less\r\n     than five hundred dollars, nor more than twelve hundred\r\n     dollars, according to the service required of him. And it\r\n     shall be the duty of the commissioner, when it can be done\r\n     consistently with public interest, to appoint, as assistant\r\n     commissioners, agents, and clerks, such men as have proved\r\n     their loyalty by faithful service in the armies of the Union\r\n     during the rebellion. And all persons appointed to service\r\n     under this act, and the act to which this is an amendment,\r\n     shall be so far deemed in the military service of the United\r\n     States as to be under the military jurisdiction and entitled\r\n     to the military protection of the Government while in\r\n     discharge of the duties of their office.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4. _And be it further enacted_, That officers of the\r\n     Veteran Reserve Corps or of the volunteer service, now on\r\n     duty in the Freedmen's Bureau as assistant commissioners,\r\n     agents, medical officers, or in other capacities, whose\r\n     regiments or corps have been or may hereafter be mustered\r\n     out of service, may be retained upon such duty as officers\r\n     of said bureau, with the same compensation as is now\r\n     provided by law for their respective grades; and the\r\n     Secretary of War shall have power to fill vacancies until\r\n     other officers can be detailed in their places without\r\n     detriment to the public service.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5. _And he it further enacted_, That the second\r\n     section of the act to which this is an amendment shall be\r\n     deemed to authorize the Secretary of War to issue such\r\n     medical stores or other supplies, and transportation, and\r\n     afford such medical or other aid as may be needful for the\r\n     purposes named in said section: _Provided_, That no person\r\n     shall be deemed 'destitute,' 'suffering,' or 'dependent upon\r\n     the Government for support,' within the meaning of this act,\r\n     who is able to find employment, and could, by proper\r\n     industry or exertion, avoid such destitution, suffering, or\r\n     dependence.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 6. Whereas, by the provisions of an act approved\r\n     February sixth, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, entitled\r\n     'An act to amend an act entitled \"An act for the collection\r\n     of direct taxes in insurrectionary districts within the\r\n     United States, and for other purposes,\" approved June\r\n     seventh, eighteen hundred and sixty-two,' certain lands in\r\n     the parishes of Saint Helena and Saint Luke, South Carolina,\r\n     were bid in by the United States at public tax sales, and,\r\n     by the limitation of said act, the time of redemption of\r\n     said lands has expired;

The following is\r\n\r\n     THE VETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\n     \"A careful examination of the bill passed by the two houses\r\n     of Congress, entitled 'An act to continue in force and to\r\n     amend \"An act to establish a bureau for the relief of\r\n     freedmen and refugees,\" and for other purposes,' has\r\n     convinced me that the legislation which it proposes would\r\n     not be consistent with the welfare of the country, and that\r\n     it falls clearly within the reasons assigned in my message\r\n     of the 19th of February last, returning without my signature\r\n     a similar measure which originated in the Senate. It is not\r\n     my purpose to repeat the objections which I then urged. They\r\n     are yet fresh in your recollection, and can be readily\r\n     examined as a part of the records of one branch of the\r\n     National Legislature. Adhering to the principles set forth\r\n     in that message, I now reäffirm them, and the line of policy\r\n     therein indicated.\r\n\r\n     \"The only ground upon which this kind of legislation can be\r\n     justified is that of the war-making power. The act of which\r\n     this bill was intended as amendatory was passed during the\r\n     existence of the war. By its own provisions, it is to\r\n     terminate within one year from the cessation of hostilities\r\n     and the declaration of peace. It is therefore yet in\r\n     existence, and it is likely that it will continue in force\r\n     as long as the freedmen may require the benefit of its\r\n     provisions. It will certainly remain in operation as a law\r\n     until some months subsequent to the meeting of the next\r\n     session of Congress, when, if experience shall make evident\r\n     the necessity of additional legislation, the two houses will\r\n     have ample time to mature and pass the requisite measures.\r\n     In the mean time the questions arise, Why should this war\r\n     measure be continued beyond the period designated in the\r\n     original act? and why, in time of peace, should military\r\n     tribunals be created to continue until each 'State shall be\r\n     fully restored in its constitutional relations to the\r\n     Government, and shall be duly represented in the Congress of\r\n     the United States?' It was manifest with respect to the act\r\n     approved March 3, 1865, that prudence and wisdom alike\r\n     required that jurisdiction over all cases concerning the\r\n     free enjoyment of the immunities and rights of citizenship,\r\n     as well as the protection of person and property, should be\r\n     conferred upon some tribunal in every State or district\r\n     where the ordinary course of judicial proceeding was\r\n     interrupted by the rebellion, and until the same should be\r\n     fully restored. At that time, therefore, an urgent necessity\r\n     existed for the passage of some such law. Now, however, war\r\n     has substantially ceased; the ordinary course of judicial\r\n     proceedings is no longer interrupted; the courts, both State\r\n     and Federal, are in full, complete, and successful\r\n     operation, and through them every person, regardless of race\r\n     or color, is entitled to and can be heard. The protection\r\n     granted to the white citizen is already conferred by law\r\n     upon the freedman; strong and stringent guards, by way of\r\n     penalties and punishments, are thrown around his person and\r\n     property, and it is believed that ample protection will be\r\n     afforded him by due process of law, without resort to the\r\n     dangerous expedient of 'military tribunals,' now that the\r\n     war has been brought to a close. The necessity no longer\r\n     existing for such tribunals, which had their origin in the\r\n     war, grave objections to their continuance must present\r\n     themselves to the minds of all reflecting and dispassionate\r\n     men. Independently of the danger in representative republics\r\n     of conferring upon the military, in time of peace,\r\n     extraordinary powers--so carefully guarded against by the\r\n     patriots and statesmen of the earlier days of the republic,\r\n     so frequently the ruin of governments founded upon the same\r\n     free principle, and subversive of the rights and liberties\r\n     of the citizen--the question of practical economy earnestly\r\n     commends itself to the consideration of the law-making\r\n     power. With an immense debt already burdening the incomes of\r\n     the industrial and laboring classes, a due regard for their\r\n     interests, so inseparably connected with the welfare of the\r\n     country, should prompt us to rigid economy and retrenchment,\r\n     and influence us to abstain from all legislation that would\r\n     unnecessarily increase the public indebtedness. Tested by\r\n     this rule of sound political wisdom, I can see no reason for\r\n     the establishment of the 'military jurisdiction' conferred\r\n     upon the officials of the bureau by the fourteenth section\r\n     of the bill.\r\n\r\n     \"By the laws of the United States, and of the different\r\n     States, competent courts, Federal and State, have been\r\n     established, and are now in full practical operation. By\r\n     means of these civil tribunals ample redress is afforded for\r\n     all private wrongs, whether to the person or to the property\r\n     of the citizen, without denial or unnecessary delay. They\r\n     are open to all, without regard to color or race. I feel\r\n     well assured that it will be better to trust the rights,\r\n     privileges, and immunities of the citizens to tribunals thus\r\n     established, and presided over by competent and impartial\r\n     judges, bound by fixed rules of law and evidence, and where\r\n     the rights of trial by jury is guaranteed and secured, than\r\n     to the caprice and judgment of an officer of the bureau,\r\n     who, it is possible, may be entirely ignorant of the\r\n     principles that underlie the just administration of the law.\r\n     There is danger, too, that conflict of jurisdiction will\r\n     frequently arise between the civil courts and these military\r\n     tribunals, each having concurrent jurisdiction over the\r\n     person and the cause of action--the one judicature\r\n     administered and controlled by civil law, the other by the\r\n     military. How is the conflict to be settled, and who is to\r\n     determine between the two tribunals when it arises? In my\r\n     opinion it is wise to guard against such conflict by leaving\r\n     to the courts and juries the protection of all civil rights\r\n     and the redress of all civil grievances.\r\n\r\n     \"The fact can not be denied that since the actual cessation\r\n     of hostilities many acts of violence--such, perhaps, as had\r\n     never been witnessed in their previous history--have\r\n     occurred in the States involved in the recent rebellion. I\r\n     believe, however, that public sentiment will sustain me in\r\n     the assertion that such deeds of wrong are not confined to\r\n     any particular State or section, but are manifested over the\r\n     entire country--demonstrating that the cause that produced\r\n     them does not depend upon any particular locality, but is\r\n     the result of the agitation and derangement incident to a\r\n     long and bloody civil war. While the prevalence of such\r\n     disorders must be greatly deplored, their occasional and\r\n     temporary occurrence would seem to furnish no necessity for\r\n     the extension of the bureau beyond the period fixed in the\r\n     original act. Besides the objections which I have thus\r\n     briefly stated, I may urge upon your consideration the\r\n     additional reason that recent developments in regard to the\r\n     practical operations of the bureau, in many of the States,\r\n     show that in numerous instances it is used by its agents as\r\n     a means of promoting their individual advantage, and that\r\n     the freedmen are employed for the advancement of the\r\n     personal ends of the officers instead of their own\r\n     improvement and welfare--thus confirming the fears\r\n     originally entertained by many that the continuation of such\r\n     a bureau for any unnecessary length of time would inevitably\r\n     result in fraud, corruption, and oppression.\r\n\r\n     \"It is proper to state that in cases of this character\r\n     investigations have been promptly ordered, and the offender\r\n     punished, whenever his guilt has been satisfactorily\r\n     established. As another reason against the necessity of the\r\n     legislation contemplated by this measure, reference may be\r\n     had to the 'Civil Rights Bill,' now a law of the land, and\r\n     which will be faithfully executed as long as it shall remain\r\n     unrepealed, and may not be declared unconstitutional by\r\n     courts of competent jurisdiction. By that act, it is enacted\r\n     'that all persons born in the United States, and not subject\r\n     to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are\r\n     hereby declared to be citizens of the United States; and\r\n     such citizens, of every race and color, without regard to\r\n     any previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude,\r\n     except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall\r\n     have been duly convicted, shall have the same right in every\r\n     State and Territory of the United States, to make and\r\n     enforce contracts, to sue, to be parties, and give evidence,\r\n     to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and\r\n     personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws\r\n     and proceedings for the security of person and property, as\r\n     is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like\r\n     punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other, any\r\n     law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom to the\r\n     contrary notwithstanding.'\r\n\r\n     \"By the provisions of the act full protection is afforded,\r\n     through the district courts of the United States, to all\r\n     persons injured, and whose privileges, as they are declared,\r\n     are in any way impaired, and heavy penalties are denounced\r\n     against the person who willfully violates the law. I need\r\n     not state that that law did not receive my approval, yet its\r\n     remedies are far preferable to those proposed in the present\r\n     bill--the one being civil and the other military.\r\n\r\n     \"By the sixth section of the bill herewith returned, certain\r\n     proceedings by which the lands in the 'parishes of St.\r\n     Helena and St. Luke, South Carolina,' were sold and bid in,\r\n     and afterward disposed of by the tax commissioners, are\r\n     ratified and confirmed. By the seventh, eighth, ninth,\r\n     tenth, and eleventh sections, provisions by law are made for\r\n     the disposal of the lands thus acquired to a particular\r\n     class of citizens. While the quieting of titles is deemed\r\n     very important and desirable, the discrimination made in the\r\n     bill seems objectionable, as does also the attempt to confer\r\n     upon the commissioners judicial powers, by which citizens of\r\n     the United States are to be deprived of their property in a\r\n     mode contrary to that provision of the Constitution which\r\n     declares that no person 'shall be deprived of life, liberty,\r\n     or property, without due process of law.' As a general\r\n     principle, such legislation is unsafe, unwise, partial, and\r\n     unconstitutional. It may deprive persons of their property\r\n     who are equally deserving objects of the nation's bounty, as\r\n     those whom, by this legislation, Congress seeks to benefit.\r\n     The title to the land thus to be proportioned out to a\r\n     favored class of citizens must depend upon the regularity of\r\n     the tax sale under the law as it existed at the time of the\r\n     sale, and no subsequent legislation can give validity to the\r\n     rights thus acquired against the original claimants. The\r\n     attention of Congress is therefore invited to a more mature\r\n     consideration of the measures proposed in these sections of\r\n     the bill.\r\n\r\n     \"In conclusion, I again urge upon Congress the danger of\r\n     class legislation, so well calculated to keep the public\r\n     mind in a state of uncertain expectation, disquiet, and\r\n     restlessness, and to encourage interested hopes and fears\r\n     that the National Government will continue to furnish to\r\n     classes of citizens, in the several States, means for\r\n     support and maintenance, regardless of whether they pursue a\r\n     life of indolence or labor, and regardless, also, of the\r\n     constitutional limitations of the national authority in\r\n     times of peace and tranquillity.\r\n\r\n     \"The bill is herewith returned to the House of\r\n     Representatives, in which it originated, for its final\r\n     action.\r\n\r\n                                             \"ANDREW JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n     \"WASHINGTON, D. C., _July_ 16, 1866.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the reading of this document had been completed, a motion\r\nwas passed that it should be laid on the table and printed. Notice was\r\ngiven that it would be called up for the action of the House on the\r\nfollowing day. Mr. Le Blond, a Democrat, suggested that it would be\r\ntoo long to wait until to-morrow to pass it over the veto, and without\r\ndebate. The sooner action was taken, the more apparent would be the\r\nbad _animus_.\r\n\r\n\"I have no objection,\" said Mr. Eliot, taking him at his word. Others\r\nsaid, \"There is no objection,\" whereupon the vote was reconsidered by\r\nwhich the matter was postponed.\r\n\r\nThe motion to reconsider the postponement was carried, and the\r\nprevious question called, \"Shall this bill become a law, the\r\nobjections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see why we need be in such a hurry,\" said Mr. Rogers.\r\n\r\n\"One of your own side suggested that the vote better be taken now,\"\r\nreplied Mr. Ashley.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he was not in earnest, of course,\" said Mr. Rogers, creating\r\nsome mirth by the remark.\r\n\r\n\"I hope the gentleman will make no objection,\" said Mr. Le Blond,\r\naddressing his remark to Mr. Rogers.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward suggested that \"the Democrats should choose their leader, and\r\nnot confuse us in this way.\"\r\n\r\nWithout further parley, the vote was one hundred and four in the\r\naffirmative, thirty-three in the negative, and forty-five \"not\r\nvoting.\" The Speaker then announced, \"Two-thirds having voted in the\r\naffirmative, the bill has, notwithstanding the objections of the\r\nPresident, again passed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Clerk of the House of Representatives immediately announced the\r\naction of that body to the Senate. Other business was at once laid\r\naside, and the Veto Message was read in the Senate.\r\n\r\nMr. Hendricks and Mr. Saulsbury then addressed the Senate in support\r\nof the position of the President. The question being taken,\r\nthirty-three voted for and twelve against the bill. Thereupon the\r\nPresident _pro tempore_ announced, \"Two-thirds of this body have\r\npassed the bill, and it having been certified that two-thirds of the\r\nHouse of Representatives have voted for this bill, I now pronounce\r\nthat this bill has become a law.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon.

Ingersoll, Representative from Illinois.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nFIRST WORDS ON RECONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n     Responsibility of the Republican Party -- Its Power and\r\n     Position -- Initiatory Step -- Mr. Stevens steaks for\r\n     Himself -- Condition of the Rebel States -- Constitutional\r\n     Authority under which Congress should act -- Estoppel --\r\n     What constitutes Congress -- The First Duty -- Basis of\r\n     Representation -- Duty on Exports -- Two important\r\n     Principles -- Mr. Raymond's Theory -- Rebel States still in\r\n     the Union -- Consequences of the Radical Theory --\r\n     Conditions to be Required -- State Sovereignty -- Rebel Debt\r\n     -- Prohibition of Slavery -- Two Policies contrasted --\r\n     Reply of Mr. Jenckes -- Difference in Terms, not in\r\n     Substance -- Logic of the Conservatives leads to the Results\r\n     of the Radicals.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving traced the progress through Congress of the great measures\r\nrelating to civil rights and protection of the freedmen, it is now\r\nproper to go back to an earlier period in this legislative history,\r\nand trace what was said and done upon a subject which, more than any\r\nother, awakened the interest and solicitude of the American\r\npeople--the subject of _Reconstruction_.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party had a majority of more than one hundred in the\r\nHouse, and after all its losses, retained more than two thirds of the\r\nSenate. As a consequence of this great preponderance of power, the\r\nparty possessing it was justly held responsible for the manner in\r\nwhich the country should pass the important political crisis\r\nconsequent upon the termination of the war in the overthrow of the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nIt became an important question for members of the Republican party in\r\nCongress to determine among themselves what line of policy they should\r\npursue.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of the Joint Committee of Fifteen on Reconstruction,\r\nwas every-where regarded by the constituents of the majority as a most\r\nhappy initiatory step. The whole country listened with eagerness to\r\nhear what words would be spoken in Congress to give some clue to the\r\ncourse the committee would recommend. Words of no uncertain\r\nsignificance and weight were uttered at an early period in the\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of December, a fortnight after the opening of the session,\r\nMr. Stevens announced his opinions on reconstruction with great\r\nboldness and distinctness. At the same time, seeing himself much in\r\nadvance of many of his party, and fearing lest his opinions might\r\nalarm the less resolute, he declared: \"I do not profess to speak their\r\nsentiments, nor must they be held responsible for them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens opened his speech with remarks on the condition of the\r\nrebel States. He said: \"The President assumes, what no one doubts,\r\nthat the late rebel States have lost their constitutional relations to\r\nthe Union, and are incapable of representation in Congress, except by\r\npermission of the Government. It matters but little, with this\r\nadmission, whether you call them States out of the Union, and now\r\nconquered territories, or assert that because the Constitution forbids\r\nthem to do what they did do, that they are, therefore, only dead as to\r\nall national and political action, and will remain so until the\r\nGovernment shall breathe into them the breath of life anew and permit\r\nthem to occupy their former position. In other words, that they are\r\nnot out of the Union, but are only dead carcasses lying within the\r\nUnion. In either case, it is very plain that it requires the action of\r\nCongress to enable them to form a State government and send\r\nRepresentatives to Congress. Nobody, I believe, pretends that with\r\ntheir old constitutions and frames of government they can be permitted\r\nto claim their old rights under the Constitution. They have torn their\r\nconstitutional States into atoms, and built on their foundations\r\nfabrics of a totally different character. Dead men can not raise\r\nthemselves. Dead States can not restore their own existence 'as it\r\nwas.' Whose especial duty is it to do it? In whom does the\r\nConstitution place the power? Not in the judicial branch of\r\nGovernment, for it only adjudicates and does not prescribe laws. Not\r\nin the Executive, for he only executes and can not make laws. Not in\r\nthe commander-in-chief of the armies, for he can only hold them under\r\nmilitary rule until the sovereign legislative power of the conqueror\r\nshall give them law.\r\n\r\n\"There is fortunately no difficulty in solving the question. There are\r\ntwo provisions in the Constitution, under one of which the case must\r\nfall. The fourth article says: 'New States may be admitted by the\r\nCongress into this Union.' In my judgment, this is the controlling\r\nprovision in this case. Unless the law of nations is a dead letter,\r\nthe late war between two acknowledged belligerents severed their\r\noriginal compacts, and broke all the ties that bound them together.\r\nThe future condition of the conquered power depends on the will of the\r\nconqueror. They must come in as new States or remain as conquered\r\nprovinces. Congress--the Senate and House of Representatives, with the\r\nconcurrence of the President--is the only power that can act in the\r\nmatter. But suppose, as some dreaming theorists imagine, that these\r\nStates have never been out of the Union, but have only destroyed their\r\nState governments so as to be incapable of political action, then the\r\nfourth section of the fourth article applies, which says, 'The United\r\nStates shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form\r\nof government.' Who is the United States? Not the judiciary; not the\r\nPresident; but the sovereign power of the people, exercised through\r\ntheir Representatives in Congress, with the concurrence of the\r\nExecutive. It means the political Government--the concurrent action of\r\nboth branches of Congress and the Executive. The separate action of\r\neach amounts to nothing either in admitting new States or guaranteeing\r\nrepublican governments to lapsed or outlawed States. Whence springs\r\nthe preposterous idea that either the President, or the Senate, or the\r\nHouse of Representatives, acting separately, can determine the right\r\nof States to send members or Senators to the Congress of the Union?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens then cited authorities to prove that \"if the so-called\r\nConfederate States of America were an independent belligerent, and\r\nwere so acknowledged by the United States and by Europe, or had\r\nassumed and maintained an attitude which entitled them to be\r\nconsidered and treated as a belligerent, then, during such time, they\r\nwere precisely in the condition of a foreign nation with whom we were\r\nat war; nor need their independence as a nation be acknowledged by us\r\nto produce that effect.\"\r\n\r\nHaving read from a number of authorities to support his position, Mr.\r\nStevens continued: \"After such clear and repeated decisions, it is\r\nsomething worse than ridiculous to hear men of respectable standing\r\nattempting to nullify the law of nations, and declare the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States in error, because, as the Constitution\r\nforbids it, the States could not go out of the Union in fact. A\r\nrespectable gentleman was lately reciting this argument, when he\r\nsuddenly stopped and said: 'Did you hear of that atrocious murder\r\ncommitted in our town? A rebel deliberately murdered a Government\r\nofficial.' The person addressed said, 'I think you are mistaken.' 'How\r\nso? I saw it myself.' 'You are wrong; no murder was or could be\r\ncommitted, for the law forbids it.'\r\n\r\n\"The theory that the rebel States, for four years a separate power and\r\nwithout representation in Congress, were all the time here in the\r\nUnion, is a good deal less ingenious and respectable than the\r\nmetaphysics of Berkeley, which proved that neither the world nor any\r\nhuman being was in existence. If this theory were simply ridiculous it\r\ncould be forgiven; but its effect is deeply injurious to the stability\r\nof the nation. I can not doubt that the late Confederate States are\r\nout of the Union to all intents and purposes for which the conqueror\r\nmay choose so to consider them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens further maintained that the rebel States should be\r\nadjudged out of the Union on the ground of estoppel. \"They are\r\nestopped,\" said he, \"both by matter of record and matter _in pais_.\r\nOne of the first resolutions passed by seceded South Carolina in\r\nJanuary, 1861, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved, unanimously_, That the separation of South\r\n     Carolina from the Federal Union is final, and she has no\r\n     further interest in the Constitution of the United States;\r\n     and that the only appropriate negotiations between her and\r\n     the Federal Government are as to their mutual relations as\r\n     foreign States.\"\r\n\r\n\"Similar resolutions appear upon all their State and Confederate\r\nGovernment records. The speeches of their members of Congress, their\r\ngenerals and executive officers, and the answers of their Government\r\nto our shameful suings for peace, went upon the defiant ground that no\r\nterms would be offered or received except upon the prior\r\nacknowledgment of the entire and permanent independence of the\r\nConfederate States. After this, to deny that we have a right to treat\r\nthem as a conquered belligerent, severed from the Union in fact, is\r\nnot argument but mockery. Whether it be our interest to do so is the\r\nonly question hereafter and more deliberately to be considered.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose these powerful but now subdued belligerents, instead of\r\nbeing out of the Union, are merely destroyed, and are now lying about,\r\na dead corpse, or with animation so suspended as to be incapable of\r\naction, and wholly unable to heal themselves by any unaided movements\r\nof their own. Then they may fall under the provision of the\r\nConstitution which says, \"the United States shall guarantee to every\r\nState in the Union a republican form of government.\" Under that power,\r\ncan the judiciary, or the President, or the commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy, or the Senate or House of Representatives, acting separately,\r\nrestore them to life and reädmit them into the Union? I insist that if\r\neach acted separately, though the action of each was identical with\r\nall the others, it would amount to nothing. Nothing but the joint\r\naction of the two houses of Congress and the concurrence of the\r\nPresident could do it. If the Senate admitted their Senators, and the\r\nHouse their members, it would have no effect on the future action of\r\nCongress. The Fortieth Congress might reject both. Such is the ragged\r\nrecord of Congress for the last four years.\"\r\n\r\nHe cited a decision of the Supreme Court to show that \"it rests with\r\nCongress to decide what government is the established one in a State,\"\r\nand then remarked: \"But Congress does not mean the Senate, or the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and President, all acting severally. Their\r\njoint action constitutes Congress. Hence a law of Congress must be\r\npassed before any new State can be admitted or any dead ones revived.\r\nUntil then, no member can be lawfully admitted into either house.\r\nHence, it appears with how little knowledge of constitutional law each\r\nbranch is urged to admit members separately from these destroyed\r\nStates. The provision that \"each house shall be the judge of the\r\nelections, returns, and qualifications of its own members,\" has not\r\nthe most distant bearing on this question. Congress must create States\r\nand declare when they are entitled to be represented. Then each house\r\nmust judge whether the members presenting themselves from a recognized\r\nState possesses the requisite qualifications of age, residence, and\r\ncitizenship, and whether the election and returns are according to\r\nlaw. The houses separately can judge of nothing else.\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious from all this, that the first duty of Congress is to\r\npass a law declaring the condition of these outside or defunct States,\r\nand providing proper civil government for them. Since the conquest,\r\nthey have been governed by martial law. Military rule is necessarily\r\ndespotic, and ought not to exist longer than is absolutely necessary.\r\nAs there are no symptoms that the people of these provinces will be\r\nprepared to participate in constitutional government for some years, I\r\nknow of no arrangement so proper for them as territorial government.\r\nThere they can learn the principles of freedom and eat the fruit of\r\nfoul rebellion. Under such governments, while electing members to the\r\nterritorial legislatures, they will necessarily mingle with those to\r\nwhom Congress shall extend the right of suffrage. In territories\r\nCongress fixes the qualifications of electors, and I know of no better\r\nplace nor better occasion for the conquered rebels and the conqueror\r\nto practice justice to all men and accustom themselves to make and\r\nobey equal laws.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens proceeded to specify amendments to the Constitution which\r\nshould be made before the late rebel States \"would be capable of\r\nacting in the Union.\" The first of those amendments would be to change\r\nthe basis of representation among the States from federal numbers to\r\nactual voters. After explaining the operation of this amendment, he\r\ndepicted the consequences of reädmitting the Southern States without\r\nthis guarantee. \"With the basis unchanged,\" said he, \"the eighty-three\r\nSouthern members, with the Democrats that will in the best of times be\r\nelected from the North, will always give them the majority in Congress\r\nand in the Electoral College. They will, at the very first election,\r\ntake possession of the White House and the halls of Congress. I need\r\nnot depict the ruin that would follow. Assumption of the rebel debt or\r\nrepudiation of the Federal debt would be sure to follow; the\r\noppression of the freedmen, the reämendment of their State\r\nconstitutions, and the reëstablishment of slavery would be the\r\ninevitable result.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens thus set forth the importance of a proposed amendment to\r\nallow Congress to lay a duty on exports: \"Its importance can not well\r\nbe overstated. It is very obvious that for many years the South will\r\nnot pay much under our internal revenue laws. The only article on\r\nwhich we can raise any considerable amount is cotton. It will be grown\r\nlargely at once. With ten cents a pound export duty, it would be\r\nfurnished cheaper to foreign markets than they could obtain it from\r\nany other part of the world. The late war has shown that. Two million\r\nbales exported, at five hundred pounds to the bale, would yield\r\n$100,000,000. This seems to be the chief revenue we shall ever derive\r\nfrom the South. Besides, it would be a protection to that amount to\r\nour domestic manufactures. Other proposed amendments--to make all laws\r\nuniform, to prohibit the assumption of the rebel debt--are of vital\r\nimportance, and the only thing that can prevent the combined forces of\r\ncopper-heads and secessionists from legislating against the interests\r\nof the Union whenever they may obtain an accidental majority.\r\n\r\n\"But this is not all that we ought to do before these inveterate\r\nrebels are invited to participate in our legislation. We have turned,\r\nor are about to turn, loose four million slaves, without a hut to\r\nshelter them or a cent in their pockets. The infernal laws of slavery\r\nhave prevented them from acquiring an education, understanding the\r\ncommonest laws of contract, or of managing the ordinary business of\r\nlife. This Congress is bound to provide for them until they can take\r\ncare of themselves. If we do not furnish them with homesteads, and\r\nhedge them around with protective laws; if we leave them to the\r\nlegislation of their late masters, we had better have left them in\r\nbondage. Their condition would be worse than that of our prisoners at\r\nAndersonville. If we fail in this great duty now, when we have the\r\npower, we shall deserve and receive the execration of history and of\r\nall future ages.\r\n\r\n\"Two things are of vital importance: 1. So to establish a principle\r\nthat none of the rebel States shall be counted in any of the\r\namendments of the Constitution until they are duly admitted into the\r\nfamily of States by the law-making power of their conqueror. For more\r\nthan six months the amendment of the Constitution abolishing slavery\r\nhas been ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the States\r\nthat acted on its passage by Congress, and which had Legislatures, or\r\nwhich were States capable of acting, or required to act, on the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"I take no account of the aggregation of whitewashed rebels, who,\r\nwithout any legal authority, have assembled in the capitals of the\r\nlate rebel States and simulated legislative bodies. Nor do I regard\r\nwith any respect the cunning by-play into which they deluded the\r\nSecretary of State by frequent telegraphic announcements that 'South\r\nCarolina had adopted the amendment,' 'Alabama has adopted the\r\namendment, being the twenty-seventh State,' etc. This was intended to\r\ndelude the people and accustom Congress to hear repeated the names of\r\nthese extinct States as if they were alive, when, in truth, they have\r\nnow no more existence than the revolted cities of Latium, two-thirds\r\nof whose people were colonized, and their property confiscated, and\r\ntheir rights of citizenship withdrawn by conquering and avenging\r\nRome.\"\r\n\r\nA second thing of vital importance to the stability of this republic,\r\nMr. Stevens asserted to be \"that it should now be solemnly decided\r\nwhat power can revive, recreate, and reinstate these provinces into\r\nthe family of States, and invest them with the rights of American\r\ncitizens. It is time that Congress should assert its sovereignty, and\r\nassume something of the dignity of a Roman senate. It is fortunate\r\nthat the President invites Congress to take this manly attitude. After\r\nstating, with great frankness, in his able message, his theory--which,\r\nhowever, is found to be impracticable, and which, I believe, very few\r\nnow consider tenable--he refers the whole matter to the judgment of\r\nCongress. If Congress should fail firmly and wisely to discharge that\r\nhigh duty, it is not the fault of the President.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens closed his speech by setting the seal of reprobation upon\r\na doctrine which is becoming too fashionable, that \"this is a white\r\nman's Government.\" He uttered a severe rebuke to those who thus\r\n\"mislead and miseducate the public mind.\"\r\n\r\nThere were some Republicans in Congress who disagreed with Mr. Stevens\r\nin his theory of the condition of the late rebel States, yet no one\r\nventured immediately, to use a contemporary expression, \"to take the\r\nRadical bull by the horns.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, three days afterward, Mr. Raymond, as a representative of\r\nthe \"Conservatives,\" ventured a reply. He thus set forth his theory as\r\nin opposition to that of Mr. Stevens: \"I can not believe that these\r\nStates have ever been out of the Union, or that they are now out of\r\nthe Union. I can not believe that they ever have been, or are now, in\r\nany sense a separate power. If they were, sir, how and when did they\r\nbecome so? They were once States of this Union--that every one\r\nconcedes; bound to the Union and made members of the Union by the\r\nConstitution of the United States. If they ever went out of the Union,\r\nit was at some specific time and by some specific act. Was it by the\r\nordinance of secession? I think we all agree that an ordinance of\r\nsecession passed by any State of this Union is simply a nullity,\r\nbecause it encounters in its practical operation the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, which is the supreme law of the land. It could have\r\nno legal, actual force or validity. It could not operate to effect any\r\nactual change in the relations of the States adopting it to the\r\nNational Government, still less to accomplish the removal of that\r\nState from the sovereign jurisdiction of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, did the resolutions of these States, the declarations of\r\ntheir officials, the speeches of members of their Legislatures, or the\r\nutterances of their press accomplish the result? Certainly not. They\r\ncould not possibly work any change whatever in the relations of these\r\nStates to the General Government. All their ordinances and all their\r\nresolutions were simply declarations of a purpose to secede. Their\r\nsecession, if it ever took place, certainly could not date from the\r\ntime when their intention to secede was first announced. After\r\ndeclaring that intention, they proceeded to carry it into effect. How?\r\nBy war. By sustaining their purpose by arms against the force which\r\nthe United States brought to bear against it. Did they sustain it?\r\nWere their arms victorious? If they were, then their secession was an\r\naccomplished fact; if not, it was nothing more than an abortive\r\nattempt, a purpose unfulfilled. This, then, is simply a question of\r\nfact, and we all know what the fact is. They did not succeed. They\r\nfailed to maintain their ground by force of arms; in other words, they\r\nfailed to secede.\r\n\r\n\"But the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevens] insists that they\r\ndid secede, and that this fact is not in the least affected by the\r\nother fact that the Constitution forbids secession. He says that the\r\nlaw forbids murder, but that murders are, nevertheless, committed. But\r\nthere is no analogy between the two cases. If secession had been\r\naccomplished; if these States had gone out, and overcome the armies\r\nthat tried to prevent their going out, then the prohibition of the\r\nConstitution could not have altered the fact. In the case of murder\r\nthe man is killed, and murder is thus committed in spite of the law.\r\nThe fact of killing is essential to the committal of the crime, and\r\nthe fact of going out is essential to secession. But in this case\r\nthere was no such fact. I think I need not argue any further the\r\nposition that the rebel States have never for one moment, by any\r\nordinances of secession, or by any successful war, carried themselves\r\nbeyond the rightful jurisdiction of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. They have interrupted for a time the practical enforcement and\r\nexercise of that jurisdiction; they rendered it impossible for a time\r\nfor this Government to enforce obedience to its laws; but there has\r\nnever been an hour when this Government, or this Congress, or this\r\nHouse, or the gentleman from Pennsylvania himself, ever conceded that\r\nthose States were beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution and laws\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the citation of authorities made by Mr. Stevens, Mr.\r\nRaymond maintained that they did not lend the \"slightest countenance\r\nto the inference which was drawn from them.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to the theory maintained by Mr. Stevens, that States\r\nforfeited their State existence by the fact of rebellion, Mr. Raymond\r\nsaid: \"I do not see how there can be any such forfeiture involved or\r\nimplied. The individual citizens of those States went into the\r\nrebellion. They thereby incurred certain penalties under the laws and\r\nConstitution of the United States. What the States did was to endeavor\r\nto interpose their State authority between the individuals in\r\nrebellion and the Government of the United States, which assumed, and\r\nwhich would carry out the assumption, to declare those individuals\r\ntraitors for their acts. The individuals in the States who were in\r\nrebellion, it seems to me, were the only parties who, under the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States, could incur the penalties\r\nof treason. I know of no law, I know of nothing in the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, I know of nothing in any recognized or established\r\ncode of international law, which can punish a State as a State for any\r\nact it may perform. It is certain that our Constitution assumes\r\nnothing of the kind. It does not deal with States, except in one or\r\ntwo instances, such as elections of members of Congress and the\r\nelection of electors of President and Vice-President.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, the main feature which distinguishes the Union under the\r\nConstitution from the old Confederation is this: that whereas the old\r\nConfederation did deal with States directly, making requisitions upon\r\nthem for supplies and relying upon them for the execution of its laws,\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, in order to form a more perfect\r\nUnion, made its laws binding on the individual citizens of the several\r\nStates, whether living in one State or in another. Congress, as the\r\nlegislative branch of this Government, enacts a law which shall be\r\noperative upon every individual within its jurisdiction. It is binding\r\nupon each individual citizen, and if he resists it by force, he is\r\nguilty of a crime, and is punished accordingly, any thing in the\r\nconstitution or laws of his State to the contrary notwithstanding. But\r\nthe States themselves are not touched by the laws of the United States\r\nor by the Constitution of the United States. A State can not be\r\nindicted; a State can not be tried; a State can not be hung for\r\ntreason. The individuals in a State may be so tried and hung, but the\r\nState as an organization, as an organic member of the Union, still\r\nexists, whether its individual citizens commit treason or not.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond subsequently cited some of the consequences which he\r\nthought must follow the acceptance of the position assumed by Mr.\r\nStevens. \"If,\" said Mr. Raymond, \"as he asserts, we have been waging\r\nwar with an independent Power, with a separate nation, I can not see\r\nhow we can talk of treason in connection with our recent conflict, or\r\ndemand the execution of Davis or any body else as a traitor. Certainly\r\nif we were at war with any other foreign Power, we should not talk of\r\nthe treason of those who were opposed to us in the field. If we were\r\nengaged in a war with France, and should take as prisoner the Emperor\r\nNapoleon, certainly we could not talk of him as a traitor or as liable\r\nto execution. I think that by adopting any such assumption as that of\r\nthe honorable gentleman, we surrender the whole idea of treason and\r\nthe punishment of traitors. I think, moreover, that we accept,\r\nvirtually and practically, the doctrine of State sovereignty, the\r\nright of a State to withdraw from the Union, and to break up the Union\r\nat its own will and pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Another of the consequences of this doctrine, as it seems to me,\r\nwould be our inability to talk of loyal men in the South. Loyal to\r\nwhat? Loyal to a foreign, independent Power, as the United States\r\nwould become under those circumstances? Certainly not. Simply disloyal\r\nto their own Government, and deserters, or whatever you may choose to\r\ncall them, from that to which they would owe allegiance, to a foreign\r\nand independent State.\r\n\r\n\"Now, there is another consequence of the doctrine which I shall not\r\ndwell upon, but simply suggest. If that confederacy was an independent\r\nPower, a separate nation, it had the right to contract debts; and we,\r\nhaving overthrown and conquered that independent Power, according to\r\nthe theory of the gentleman from Pennsylvania, would become the\r\nsuccessors, the inheritors, of its debts and assets, and we must pay\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond set forth his theory of the conditions and relations of\r\nthe late rebel States in the following language: \"I certainly do not\r\nthink these States are to be dealt with by us as provinces--as simply\r\nso much territory--held to us by no other ties than those of conquest.\r\nI think we are to deal with them as States having State governments,\r\nstill subject to the jurisdiction of the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States, still under the constitutional control of the National\r\nGovernment; and that in our dealings with them we are to be guided and\r\ngoverned, not simply by our sovereign will and pleasure as conquerors,\r\nbut by the restrictions and limitations of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, precisely as we are restrained and limited in our\r\ndealings with all other States of the American Union.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to the question how we are to deal with the late rebel\r\nStates, Mr. Raymond remarked: \"I think we have a full and perfect\r\nright to require certain conditions in the nature of guarantees for\r\nthe future, and that right rests, primarily and technically, on the\r\nsurrender we may and must require at their hands. The rebellion has\r\nbeen defeated. A defeat always implies a surrender, and, in a\r\npolitical sense, a surrender implies more than the transfer of the\r\narms used on the field of battle. It implies, in the case of civil\r\nwar, a surrender of the principles and doctrines, of all the weapons\r\nand agencies, by which the war has been carried on. The military\r\nsurrender was made on the field of battle, to our generals, as the\r\nagents and representatives of the Commander-in-chief of the armies of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\"Now, there must be at the end of the war, a similar surrender on the\r\npolitical field of controversy. That surrender is due as an act of\r\njustice from the defeated party to the victorious party. It is due,\r\nalso, and we have a right to exact it, as a guarantee for the future.\r\nWhy do we demand the surrender of their arms by the vanquished in\r\nevery battle? We do it that they may not renew the contest. Why do we\r\nseek, in this and all similar cases, a surrender of the principles for\r\nwhich they fought? It is that they may never again be made the basis\r\nof controversy and rebellion against the Government of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what are those principles which should be thus surrendered? The\r\nprinciple of State sovereignty is one of them. It was the corner-stone\r\nof the rebellion--at once its animating spirit and its fundamental\r\nbasis. Deeply ingrained as it was in the Southern heart, it must be\r\nsurrendered. The ordinances in which it was embodied must not only be\r\nrepealed, the principle itself must be abandoned, and the ordinances,\r\nso far as this war is concerned, be declared null and void, and that\r\ndeclaration must be embodied in their fundamental constitutions.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech was here interrupted by Mr. Bingham, who insisted that the\r\nadoption of the principle in the State constitutions would not be\r\nsufficient guarantee. Adoption in the Constitution of the United\r\nStates was essential to its permanent effective force.\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond thought the Constitution of the United States as plain as\r\npossible in its declaration against the doctrine of State sovereignty.\r\nIf any more explicit denial could be got into the Constitution, he\r\nwould favor it.\r\n\r\n\"Another thing,\" said Mr. Raymond, \"to be surrendered by the defeated\r\nrebellion is the obligation to pay the rebel war debt. We have the\r\nright to require this repudiation of their debt, because the money\r\nrepresented by that debt was one of the weapons with which they\r\ncarried on the war against the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"There is another thing which we have the right to require, and that\r\nis the prohibition of slavery. We have the right to require them to do\r\nthis, not only in their State constitutions, but in the Constitution\r\nof the United States. And we have required it, and it has been\r\nconceded. They have also conceded that Congress may make such laws as\r\nmay be requisite to carry that prohibition into effect, which includes\r\nsuch legislation as may be required to secure for them protection of\r\ntheir civil and personal rights--their 'right to life, liberty, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spalding having inquired whether there was any limit to the right\r\nto make these requisitions, except the good judgment of Congress, Mr.\r\nRaymond answered:\r\n\r\n\"My impression is that these requisitions are made as a part of the\r\nterms of surrender which we have a right to demand at the hands of the\r\ndefeated insurgents, and that it belongs, therefore, to the President,\r\nas Commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, to\r\nmake them, and to fix the limit, as to what they shall embrace.\"\r\n\r\nBy way of setting forth the opinions of the \"Radicals\" in as strong a\r\nlight as possible, Mr. Raymond said: \"It may be for the welfare of\r\nthis nation that we shall cherish toward the millions of our people\r\nlately in rebellion feelings of hatred and distrust; that we shall\r\nnurse the bitterness their infamous treason has naturally and justly\r\nengendered, and make that the basis of our future dealings with them.\r\nPossibly we may best teach them the lessons of liberty, by visiting\r\nupon them the worst excesses of despotism. Possibly they may best\r\nlearn to practice justice toward others, to admire and emulate our\r\nrepublican institutions, by suffering at our hands the absolute rule\r\nwe denounce in others. It may be best for us and for them that we\r\ndiscard, in all our dealings with them, all the obligations and\r\nrequirements of the Constitution, and assert as the only law for them\r\nthe unrestrained will of conquerors and masters.\"\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this, he placed what he supposed to be a different\r\npolicy: \"I would exact from them, or impose upon them through the\r\nconstitutional legislation of Congress, and by enlarging and\r\nextending, if necessary, the scope and powers of the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, proper care and protection for the helpless and friendless\r\nfreedmen, so lately their slaves. I would exercise a rigid scrutiny\r\ninto the character and loyalty of the men whom they may send to\r\nCongress, before I allowed them to participate in the high prerogative\r\nof legislating for the nation. But I would seek to allay rather than\r\nstimulate the animosities and hatred, however just they may be, to\r\nwhich the war has given rise. But for our own sake as well as for\r\ntheirs, I would not visit upon them a policy of confiscation which has\r\nbeen discarded in the policy and practical conduct of every civilized\r\nnation on the face of the globe.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond having closed his speech, it was moved that the Committee\r\nof the Whole should rise, but the motion was withdrawn to allow Mr.\r\nJenckes, of Rhode Island, five minutes for reply. He said: \"The\r\ngentleman states, and properly, that every act or ordinance of\r\nsecession was a nullity. Undoubtedly it was. Upon that question of law\r\nwe do not disagree. But he seems to me to overlook entirely what was\r\nthe state of facts from the time of the passage of the ordinances of\r\nsecession until the time of the surrender of Lee's army. During that\r\nperiod what were the relations which all that territory--I will not\r\nuse the term States, but all that territory--between the Potomac and\r\nthe Rio Grande sustained to the Government of the United States? Who\r\ncould see States there for any purpose for which legislation was\r\nrequired by the Constitution of the United States?\r\n\r\n\"At the time of the passage of the ordinance of secession, States were\r\norganized there, in existence, in action, known to the Constitution\r\nand the constitutional authorities under it. But were they loyal? Did\r\nthey obey the Constitution of the United States? This is a question\r\nthat needs no answer other than that which is conveyed to every mind\r\nby the recollection of the last four years of war, with their\r\nexpenditure of treasure and blood. Those States were not destroyed, in\r\nthe technical language of the law--they simply died out. As their\r\nGovernors passed out of office, as the terms of their legislatures\r\nexpired, who knew those facts? None but themselves. And yet, behind\r\nthis grand cordon of armies, stretching from here to the Rio Grande,\r\nthere were States in existence, organized as States, but States in\r\nrebellion, occupying the territory belonging to the people of the\r\nUnited States. They were not acting in concert with this Government,\r\nbut against it. That, Mr. Chairman, is a matter of fact. My eyes are\r\nnot dimmed or blinded by the parchment upon which constitutions or\r\nlaws are written. I, like the men who carried the bayonets and planted\r\nthe cannon, recognize the fact that was before us during all this\r\ntime. There was a state of rebellion. There were in that part of our\r\nterritory no States known to our Constitution or the laws that we\r\nenact, or the officers whose duty it is to enforce those laws.\r\n\r\n\"I recognize, too, the next fact. Bear in mind, I am simply stating\r\nnow what I conceive to be the facts. The question as to what may be\r\nthe law can be reserved for discussion on another occasion. I\r\nrecognize fully the duties of the Executive. And it was the duty of\r\nthe President of the United States, as the head of the civil and\r\nmilitary power of this great republic--not 'empire;' God forbid that\r\nthis country should ever be so designated with applause or even with\r\ntoleration--to beat down armed opposition to it, whether it came from\r\na foreign power or from domestic insurrection. That was the duty of\r\nthe President, and he recognized it; and it was not the duty of any\r\none in this Congress to gainsay it. It was written on the face of the\r\nConstitution that the President was to see that the laws should be\r\nfaithfully executed, and the power of this republic maintained, and he\r\ndid so.\r\n\r\n\"The next fact--the fact which seems to me to be the one most\r\npertinent for consideration now--is that the military power which was\r\nopposed to this Government has been destroyed. It was the duty of the\r\nExecutive to see that this was done, and to report to the Congress of\r\nthe United States that it has been done. But what then? Then there\r\ncomes the third question of fact, intimately connected with the last,\r\nand hardly separable from it, because it requires the immediate action\r\nof the Executive and of Congress. All the power that existed in the\r\nshape of Confederated States behind rebel bayonets and fortifications\r\nhas fallen to the earth. The territory which these States in rebellion\r\noccupied was the property of the people of the United States, and\r\nnever could be taken from us. I hold it to be a question of public\r\nlaw, worthy of consideration by the representatives of the American\r\npeople, by the President and the Administration generally, to\r\nascertain what existed in the shape of civil constitutions and laws\r\nbehind the military government that has been overthrown. I hesitate\r\nnot to say, here or elsewhere, that the Executive of this Government\r\nhas done his duty in this matter. All conquering nations, when they\r\novercome a rebellious people by overthrowing their military power,\r\nlook, as did the Government of Great Britain when it had overcome the\r\nmutiny in India, to see what government of a civil kind has existed or\r\nmay exist from custom among the people who are conquered. I see no\r\nreason in this view to discriminate between the argument of the\r\ngentleman from Pennsylvania and the argument of the gentleman from New\r\nYork. It seems to me, that if they will look at the particular\r\nquestions which are now before us, and which require our action, the\r\ndifferences would be in terms and not in substance.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of the predominant party generally acquiesced in the\r\nopinion of Mr. Jenckes, as expressed in the conclusion of his remarks\r\nas above presented. They conceived that the difference between the\r\nvarious views of the whole question was \"one of details and not of\r\nessence.\" The question of reconstruction was purely practical. All\r\nshades of opinion in the Republican party blended in this: that the\r\nStates in question were not to be restored until satisfactory pledges\r\nwere given to the United States. All speculation or attempt at\r\nargument in reference to their abstract condition was consequently\r\nsuperfluous--\"a pernicious abstraction,\" in the language of Mr.\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nIf some were not prepared to accept the deductions of Mr. Stevens, yet\r\naccepting the logic of Mr. Raymond, they would be carried almost as\r\nfar. The latter held that the citizens of those States were defeated\r\ninsurgents who must submit to any conditions of surrender imposed by\r\nthe victorious commander. Certain concessions could be rightfully\r\ndemanded as parts of their surrender and conditions of their\r\nrestoration. Their acquiescence had been required in a constitutional\r\namendment affecting the great social and industrial interests of\r\nSouthern society. After this none could deny the right, whatever might\r\nbe the expediency, of requiring their assent to other amendments\r\nbearing upon the political structure of the Southern States.\r\n\r\nSome of the predominant party were willing to stop short in their\r\ndemands upon the rebel States with requiring acceptance of the\r\nemancipation amendment, repudiation of the rebel debt, legal\r\nprotection of freedmen, and revocation of the ordinances of secession.\r\nThe majority, however, were disposed to go still further, and demand\r\nother conditions and guarantees which should become a part of the\r\nfundamental law of the land. This was the practical work of\r\nreconstruction for which the Joint Committee of Fifteen was preparing\r\nthe way, and upon which Congress was soon to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE BASIS OF REPRESENTATION--IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n     First work of the Joint Committee -- The joint resolution\r\n     proposing a constitutional amendment -- Mr. Stevens' reasons\r\n     for speedy action -- Protracted discussion commenced --\r\n     Objections to the bill by Mr. Rogers -- Defense by Mr.\r\n     Conkling -- Two other modes -- How States might evade the\r\n     Law -- Not a finality -- Wisconsin and South Carolina --\r\n     Amendment for Female Suffrage proposed -- Orth on Indiana\r\n     and Massachusetts -- Obscuration of the sun -- More Radical\r\n     remedy desired -- A Kentuckian gratified -- Citations from\r\n     the Census -- Premium for Treason -- White Slaves -- Power\r\n     to amend well-nigh exhausted -- Objections to the Suffrage\r\n     Basis -- \"Race\" and \"Color\" ambiguous -- Condition of the\r\n     Question -- Recommitted -- Final passage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Joint Committee of Fifteen were assiduous in their\r\nattention to the work assigned them, it was not until the 22d of\r\nJanuary, 1866, that they were ready to make a partial report and\r\nrecommend a practical measure for the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nOn that day Mr. Fessenden, of the Senate, and Mr. Stevens, of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, brought before those bodies respectively a\r\npartial report from the committee, recommending the passage of the\r\nfollowing joint resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n     United States of America in Congress assembled_, (two-thirds\r\n     of both houses concurring,) That the following article be\r\n     proposed to the Legislatures of the several States as an\r\n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which,\r\n     when ratified by three-fourths of the said Legislatures,\r\n     shall be valid as part of said Constitution, namely:\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE--. Representatives and direct taxes shall be\r\n     apportioned among the several States which may be included\r\n     within this Union according to their respective numbers,\r\n     counting the whole number of persons in each State,\r\n     excluding Indians not taxed: _Provided_, That whenever the\r\n     elective franchise shall be denied or abridged in any State\r\n     on account of race or color, all persons of such race or\r\n     color shall be excluded from the basis of representation.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate this subject was laid over, and was not reached for\r\nseveral days, as the Freedmen's Bureau Bill was then under discussion.\r\n\r\nThe subject was pressed upon the attention of the House for immediate\r\naction. Mr. Stevens had no intention to make a speech, since the\r\nquestion had been under consideration by every member for the last six\r\nweeks. He remarked, however: \"There are twenty-two States whose\r\nLegislatures are now in session, some of which will adjourn within two\r\nor three weeks. It is very desirable, if this amendment is to be\r\nadopted, that it should go forth to be acted upon by the Legislatures\r\nnow in session. It proposes to change the present basis of\r\nrepresentation to a representation upon all persons, with the proviso\r\nthat wherever any State excludes a particular class of persons from\r\nthe elective franchise, that State to that extent shall not be\r\nentitled to be represented in Congress. It does not deny to the States\r\nthe right to regulate the elective franchise as they please; but it\r\ndoes say to a State, 'If you exclude from the right of suffrage\r\nFrenchmen, Irishmen, or any particular class of people, none of that\r\nclass of persons shall be counted in fixing your representation in\r\nthis House. You may allow them to vote or not, as you please; but if\r\nyou do allow them to vote, they will be counted and represented here;\r\nwhile if you do not allow them to vote, no one shall be authorized to\r\nrepresent them here; they shall be excluded from the basis of\r\nrepresentation.'\"\r\n\r\nAs indicative of the apparent harmony of sentiments prevailing on the\r\nquestion, Mr. Wilson said that the Committee on the Judiciary had\r\ndetermined to report a proposition substantially identical with that\r\noffered by Mr. Stevens.\r\n\r\nIt was deemed important to have the joint resolution passed as soon as\r\npossible, that it might go before the State Legislatures then in\r\nsession for their ratification before their adjournment. The member\r\nwho had the measure in charge desired, after one or two speeches on\r\neither side, to have the question put to vote, and have the resolution\r\npassed before the sun went down. Such action, however, seemed to the\r\nHouse too hasty, and a discussion of the measure was entered upon,\r\nwhich ran through many days.\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers, a member of the committee, offered a minority report, and\r\naddressed the House in opposition to the proposed amendment of the\r\nConstitution. He thus presented his view of the object of the measure\r\nproposed: \"It appears to have in its body, in its soul, and in its\r\nlife only one great object and aim; that is, to debase and degrade the\r\nwhite race, and to place upon a higher footing than the white men are\r\nplaced, under the Constitution, this African race. It is a proposition\r\nto change the organic law of the land with regard to one of the\r\nfundamental principles which was laid down by our fathers at the\r\nformation of the Constitution as an axiom of civil and political\r\nliberty, that taxation and representation should always go together.\r\nIf gentlemen will examine this proposed amendment of the Constitution,\r\nthey will see that it is in violation of that great doctrine which was\r\nproclaimed by the fathers of the republic when they enunciated the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and protested against the tyranny and\r\ndespotism of England, because she attempted to tax the people of the\r\ncolonies without allowing them representation in the councils of the\r\nkingdom. The amendment now under consideration proposes the very same\r\nidentical thing that the Parliament of England proposed when it\r\nattempted to inflict upon the American colonies taxation without\r\nallowing the people of the colonies to have representatives in the\r\nParliament of England to represent them upon the question whether they\r\nshould be taxed by the mother country or not.\r\n\r\n\"The first objection I have to the passage of this joint resolution\r\nis, that it is violative of the main principle upon which the\r\nRevolutionary War was conducted, and which induced our fathers to\r\nenter the harbors of Boston and New York and throw the tea into the\r\nwater. Because the British people attempted to inflict taxation upon\r\nthem with regard to that tea, and refused to allow them representation\r\nin the Parliament of England, our fathers rebelled against their\r\nmother country. What has come over the fortunes and happiness of the\r\npeople of this country that the great principle of the Constitution\r\nshould now be violated, that principle for which our fathers spilt\r\ntheir blood to sustain, the great axiom of American liberty, that\r\ntaxation never should be imposed upon a people unless that people have\r\na corresponding representation? If this amendment to the Constitution\r\nshould be carried into effect, it will prevent any State, North or\r\nSouth, from allowing qualified suffrage to its colored population,\r\nexcept upon forfeiture of representation; and if qualified suffrage\r\nshould be allowed to the colored population of any State in this\r\nUnion, on account of race of color, and but one single negro should be\r\ndeprived of his vote by failure to meet the requirements of the\r\nqualification imposed, that State would be denied representation for\r\nthe whole of that colored population--men, women, and children.\r\n\r\n\"More than that: this bill attempts, in an indirect manner, to have\r\npassed upon, by the Legislatures of the different States, a question\r\nwhich the party in power dare not boldly and openly meet before the\r\npeople of this country, because there can be but one object lying at\r\nthe foundation of this bill--an object which has been explained and\r\nexpatiated upon in this House--and that object, as I have said, is,\r\nthrough the Federal power, to force the States to adopt unqualified\r\nnegro suffrage, by holding over them the penalty of being deprived of\r\nrepresentation according to population.\r\n\r\n\"But I object to this joint resolution upon another ground--upon the\r\nsame ground that I objected to the passage of the Negro Suffrage Bill\r\nfor the District of Columbia--without consulting the people. It has\r\nbeen said in this country that all power emanates from the people. And\r\nI say that to submit this grave question to the consideration and\r\ndecision of partisan Legislatures in the different States--Legislatures\r\nwhich were elected without any regard to this question--is violative\r\nof the great principles which lie at the foundations of the liberties\r\nof this country; that no organic law, affecting the whole people,\r\nshould be passed before submitting it to the people for their\r\nratification or rejection. Now this joint resolution proposes simply\r\nto submit this amendment for ratification to the Legislatures of the\r\ndifferent States. The Legislatures are not the States; the\r\nLegislatures are not the people in their sovereign capacity;\r\nLegislatures are not the source from which all power emanates. But the\r\npeople, the _sacred people_, in the exercise of their sovereign power,\r\neither at the ballot-box or in conventions, are the only true and\r\nproper forum to which such grave and serious questions should be\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\n\"I maintain that the Constitution of the United States, as it now\r\nexists, is not as liberal toward the Southern States, now that slavery\r\nhas been abolished, as it was before the abolition of slavery. Why,\r\nsir, in the days of the past, under our Constitution, the Southern\r\nStates have been allowed a representation for a population that was\r\nnot classed as citizens or people; they were allowed a representation\r\nfor people who had no political _status_ in the State; persons who\r\nwere not entitled even to exercise the right of coming into a court of\r\ncivil justice as a plaintiff or defendant in the prosecution or\r\ndefense of a suit.\r\n\r\n\"Now, after the raging fires of war have swept from the domain of\r\nevery State in the South the pernicious institution of slavery; after\r\nthe result has been that every slave has received his freedom; after\r\nthe slaves have gained more by the success of this war than any other\r\nclass of people in the United States, white men, men who are the\r\nrepresentatives of the white race, come here proposing to compel the\r\nStates, on pain of being deprived of a portion of their\r\nrepresentation, to allow all the negroes within their limits to vote,\r\nwithout regard to qualification or any thing else, while under the\r\nsame provision the State may, by its organic law, impose\r\nqualifications and conditions upon the exercise of the right of\r\nsuffrage by the white population. The proposed amendment to the\r\nConstitution undertakes to consolidate the power in the Federal\r\nGovernment. It throws out a menace to the States, and the inevitable\r\nresult of the passage would be to induce every State in the Union to\r\nadopt unqualified negro suffrage, so as not to deprive them of the\r\ngreat and inestimable right of representation for that class of\r\npopulation in the halls of the legislation of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Conkling, also a member of the Reconstruction Committee, made an\r\nargument in favor, of the proposed amendment: \"Emancipation vitalizes\r\nonly natural rights, not political rights. Enfranchisement alone\r\ncarries with it political rights, and these emancipated millions are\r\nno more enfranchised now than when they were slaves. They never had\r\npolitical power. Their masters had a fraction of power as masters. But\r\nthere are no masters now. There are no slaves now. The whole\r\nrelationship in which the power originated and existed is gone. Does\r\nthis fraction of power still survive? If it does, what shall become of\r\nit? Where is it to go?\r\n\r\n\"We are told the blacks are unfit to wield even a fraction of power,\r\nand must not have it. That answers the whole question. If the answer\r\nbe true, it is the end of controversy. There is no place, logically,\r\nfor this power to go, save to the blacks; if they are unfit to have\r\nit, the power would not exist. It is a power astray, without a\r\nrightful owner. It should be resumed by the whole nation at once. It\r\nshould not exist; it does not exist. This fractional power is\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\n\"A moral earthquake has turned fractions into units, and units into\r\nciphers. If a black man counts at all now, he counts five-fifths of a\r\nman, not three-fifths. Revolutions have no such fractions in their\r\narithmetic; war and humanity join hands to blot them out. Four\r\nmillions, therefore, and not three-fifths of four millions, are to be\r\nreckoned in here now, and all these four millions are, and are to be,\r\nwe are told, unfit for political existence.\r\n\r\n\"Did the framers of the Constitution ever dream of this? Never, very\r\nclearly. Our fathers trusted to gradual and voluntary emancipation,\r\nwhich would go hand in hand with education and enfranchisement. They\r\nnever peered into the bloody epoch when four million fetters would be\r\nat once melted off in the fires of war. They never saw such a vision\r\nas we see. Four millions, each a Caspar Hauser, long shut up in\r\ndarkness, and suddenly led out into the full flash of noon, and each,\r\nwe are told, too blind to walk, politically. No one foresaw such an\r\nevent, and so no provision was made for it. The three-fifths rule gave\r\nthe slaveholding States, over and above all their just representation,\r\neighteen Representatives beside, by the enumeration of 1860.\r\n\r\n\"The new situation will enable those States, when relationships are\r\nresumed, to claim twenty-eight Representatives beside their just\r\nproportion. Twenty-eight votes to be cast here and in the Electoral\r\nCollege for those held not fit to sit as jurors, not fit to testify in\r\ncourt, not fit to be plaintiff in a suit, not fit to approach the\r\nballot-box! Twenty-eight votes to be more or less controlled by those\r\nwho once betrayed the Government, and for those so destitute, we are\r\nassured, of intelligent instinct as not to be fit for free agency!\r\n\r\n\"Shall all this be? Shall four million beings count four millions, in\r\nmanaging the affairs of the nation, who are pronounced by their\r\nfellow-beings unfit to participate in administering government in the\r\nStates where they live, or in their counties, towns, or precincts; who\r\nare pronounced unworthy of the least and most paltry part in local\r\npolitical affairs? Shall one hundred and twenty-seven thousand white\r\npeople in New York cast but one vote in this House, and have none but\r\none voice here, while the same number of white people in Mississippi\r\nhave three votes and three voices? Shall the death of slavery add\r\ntwo-fifths to the entire power which slavery had when slavery was\r\nliving? Shall one white man have as much share in the Government as\r\nthree other white men merely because he lives where blacks outnumber\r\nwhites two to one? Shall this inequality exist, and exist only in\r\nfavor of those who without cause drenched the land with blood and\r\ncovered it with mourning? Shall such be the reward of those who did\r\nthe foulest and guiltiest act which crimsons the annals of recorded\r\ntime? No, sir; not if I can help it.\"\r\n\r\nTwo other modes of meeting the case had been considered by the\r\ncommittee, namely: _First_, To make the basis of representation in\r\nCongress and the Electoral College consist of sufficiently qualified\r\nvoters alone; _Second_, To deprive the States of the power to\r\ndisqualify or discriminate politically on account of race or color.\r\n\r\nAfter presenting some reasons why the committee saw proper to\r\nrecommend neither of these plans, Mr. Conkling further argued in favor\r\nof the proposed amendment: \"It contains but one condition, and that\r\nrests upon a principle already imbedded in the Constitution, and as\r\nold as free government itself. That principle I affirmed in the\r\nbeginning; namely, that representation does not belong to those who\r\nhave not political existence, but to those who have. The object of the\r\namendment is to enforce this truth. It therefore provides that\r\nwhenever any State finds within its borders a race of beings unfit for\r\npolitical existence, that race shall not be represented in the Federal\r\nGovernment. Every State will be left free to extend or withhold the\r\nelective franchise on such terms as it pleases, and this without\r\nlosing any thing in representation if the terms are impartial as to\r\nall. Qualifications of voters may be required of any kind--qualifications\r\nof intelligence, of property, or of any sort whatever, and yet no loss\r\nof representation shall thereby be suffered. But whenever in any\r\nState, and so long as a race can be found which is so low, so bad, so\r\nignorant, so stupid, that it is deemed necessary to exclude men from\r\nthe right to vote merely because they belong to that race, in that\r\ncase the race shall likewise be excluded from the sum of Federal power\r\nto which the State is entitled. If a race is so vile or worthless that\r\nto belong to it is alone cause of exclusion from political action, the\r\nrace is not to be counted here in Congress.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Conkling maintained that the pending proposition commended itself\r\nfor many reasons. \"_First._ It provides for representation coëxtensive\r\nwith taxation. I say it provides for this; it does not certainly\r\nsecure it, but it enables every State to secure it. It does not,\r\ntherefore, as the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Rogers] insists,\r\nviolate the rule that representation should go with taxation. If a\r\nrace in any State is kept unfit to vote, and fit only to drudge, the\r\nwealth created by its work ought to be taxed. Those who profit by such\r\na system, or such a condition of things, ought to be taxed for it. Let\r\nthem build churches and school-houses, and found newspapers, as New\r\nYork and other States have done, and educate their people till they\r\nare fit to vote. 'Fair play,' 'A fair day's wages for a fair day's\r\nwork,' 'Live and let live'--these mottoes, if blazoned over the\r\ninstitutions of a State, will insure it against being cursed for any\r\nlength of time with inhabitants so worthless that they are fit only\r\nfor beasts of burden. I have said that the amendment provides for\r\nrepresentation going hand in hand with taxation. That is its first\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\n\"_Second._ It brings into the basis both sexes and all ages, and so it\r\ncounteracts and avoids, as far as possible, the casual and\r\ngeographical inequalities of population.\r\n\r\n\"_Third._ It puts every State on an equal footing in the requirement\r\nprescribed.\r\n\r\n\"_Fourth._ It leaves every State unfettered to enumerate all its\r\npeople for representation or not, just as it pleases.\r\n\r\n\"Thus every State has the sole control, free from all interference, of\r\nits own interests and concerns. No other State, nor the General\r\nGovernment, can molest the people of any State on the subject, or even\r\ninquire into their acts or their reasons, but all the States have\r\nequal rights. If New York chooses to count her black population as\r\npolitical persons, she can do so. If she does not choose to do so, the\r\nmatter is her own, and her rights can not be challenged. So of South\r\nCarolina. But South Carolina shall not say, 'True, we have less than\r\nthree hundred thousand \"persons\" in this State, politically speaking,\r\nyet we will have, in governing the country, the power of seven hundred\r\nthousand persons.'\r\n\r\n\"The amendment is common to all States and equal for all; its\r\noperation will, of course, be practically only in the South. No\r\nNorthern State will lose by it, whether the Southern States extend\r\nsuffrage to blacks or not. Even New York, in her great population, has\r\nso few blacks that she could exclude them all from enumeration and it\r\nwould make no difference in her representation. If the amendment is\r\nadopted, and suffrage remains confined as it is now, taking the census\r\nof 1860 as the foundation of the calculation, and the number of\r\nRepresentatives as it then stood, the gains and losses would be these:\r\nWisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania,\r\nMassachusetts, New Jersey, and Maine would gain one Representative\r\neach, and New York would gain three; Alabama, Kentucky, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee would each lose one; Georgia,\r\nLouisiana, and Virginia would each lose two, and Mississippi would\r\nlose three.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, January 23d, the proposed joint resolution came\r\nup in the regular order of business.\r\n\r\nMr. Jenckes, of Rhode Island, feared that a construction might be put\r\nupon the bill which would be fatal to its efficiency for the purposes\r\nhad in view by its friends. He said: \"It says nothing about the\r\nqualification of property. Suppose this amendment is adopted by\r\nthree-fourths of the States, and becomes a part of the fundamental law\r\nof the land, and after its adoption the State of South Carolina should\r\nreinstate the constitution of 1790, striking out the word 'white' and\r\nreëstablishing the property qualification of fifty acres of land, or\r\ntown lots, or the payment of a tax, there would then be no\r\ndiscrimination of color in the State of South Carolina, yet the number\r\nof electors would not be enlarged five hundred, and the basis of\r\nrepresentation would be exactly as it is, with the addition of\r\ntwo-fifths of the enfranchised freedmen. A Representative to this\r\nHouse would be reëlected by the same voting constituency as now,\r\nperhaps with the addition of five hundred black men in the State. If\r\nit bears this construction, and I believe it does, I shall vote\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\n\"If any of the States should establish property qualification based\r\nupon lands, then the same oligarchy would be enthroned on the whole\r\nbasis of representation, entitled to a larger number of\r\nRepresentatives than now in this House, and elected by a slightly\r\nenlarged number of qualified electors, giving power more firmly to\r\nthat very aristocracy we have sought to overthrow.\"\r\n\r\nA number of queries were propounded, several amendments proposed, and\r\na considerable desire for discussion expressed, until Mr. Stevens,\r\nmuch disappointed at the reception the measure met in the House,\r\nwithdrew the demand for the previous question, and left the subject\r\nopen for unlimited debate.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine, of Maine, addressed the House, detailing some objections\r\nto the measure. He said: \"While I shall vote for the proposition, I\r\nshall do so with some reluctance unless it is amended, and I do not\r\nregret, therefore, that the previous question was not sustained. I am\r\negotistic enough to believe that the phraseology of the original\r\nresolution, as introduced by me, was better than that employed in the\r\npending amendment. The phrase 'civil or political rights or\r\nprivileges,' which I employed, is broader and more comprehensive than\r\nthe term 'elective franchise,' for I fear, with the gentleman from\r\nIllinois, [Mr. Farnsworth,] that under the latter phrase the most\r\nvicious evasions might be practiced. As that gentleman has well said,\r\nthey might make suffrage depend on ownership of fifty acres of land,\r\nand then prohibit any negro holding real estate; but no such mockery\r\nas this could be perpetrated under the provisions of the amendment as\r\nI originally submitted it.\"\r\n\r\nIn relation to taxation, Mr. Blaine remarked: \"Now, I contend that\r\nordinary fair play--and certainly we can afford fair play where it\r\ndoes not cost any thing--calls for this, namely, that if we exclude\r\nthem from the basis of representation they should be excluded from the\r\nbasis of taxation. Ever since this Government was founded, taxation\r\nand representation have always gone hand in hand. If we shall exclude\r\nthe principle in this amendment, we will be accused of a narrow,\r\nilliberal, mean-spirited, and money-grasping policy. More than that,\r\nwe do not gain any thing by it. What kind of taxation, is distributed\r\naccording to representation? Direct taxation. Now, we do not have any\r\ndirect taxation. There has been but twenty millions of direct taxation\r\nlevied for the last fifty years. That tax was levied in 1861, and was\r\nnot collected, but distributed among the States and held in the\r\nTreasury Department as an offset to the war claims of the States; so\r\nthat, as a matter of fact, we are putting an offensive discrimination\r\nin this proposition and gaining nothing by it except obloquy.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Donnelly, of Minnesota, said: \"It follows, as a logical\r\nconclusion, that if men have no voice in the National Government,\r\nother men should not sit in this hall pretending to represent them.\r\nAnd it is equally clear that an oppressed race should not lend power\r\nto their oppressors, to be used in their name and for their\r\ndestruction. It is a mockery to say that a man's agent shall be his\r\nenemy, and shall be appointed without his consent and against his\r\ndesire, and by other enemies.\r\n\r\n\"In fact, I can not see how any Northern man can vote against this\r\nmeasure, unless he wishes to perpetuate an injustice to his section,\r\nbecause the effect of it will clearly be to increase the\r\nrepresentation of the North and decrease that of the South; and this,\r\ntoo, upon a basis of undoubted justice. It means simply that those who\r\ndo not take part in the Government shall not be represented in the\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Donnelly did not, however, regard the proposed amendment as \"a\r\ngrand panacea for all the ills that affect the nation.\" He would vote\r\nfor the law, \"not as a finality, but as a partial step as one of a\r\nseries of necessary laws.\" Said he, \"When we vote for this measure, it\r\nmust be because we think it right and necessary, not that it may\r\nfurnish us with an excuse for failing to do all other right and\r\nnecessary things expected of us by the people. We must take direct,\r\nnot sidelong measures. We must make laws, not arguments. We must\r\nenforce, not induce.\r\n\r\n\"To pass this law and then hope that South Carolina, moved by the hope\r\nof future power, would do justice to the negro, is absurd. She has\r\n291,300 whites and 412,406 negroes. To pass such a law would be for\r\nthe governing power to divest itself of the government and hand it\r\nover to a subject and despised caste, and that, too, for a faint hope\r\nof some future advantage that might never be realized under the most\r\nfavorable circumstances, and certainly could never be realized by the\r\naspiring class abdicating and relinquishing power. The same is true,\r\nmore or less, of all the South. In Mississippi there are 353,901\r\nwhites, and 436,631 negroes; and in all the States the negro vote\r\nwould be large enough to turn the scale against the disloyal party.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sloan, of Wisconsin, thus presented the practical workings of the\r\n\"Constitution as it is:\" \"Look at the practical operation of the\r\nquestion we are discussing to-day. In the State I represent there are\r\neight hundred thousand free white people loyal to the Constitution,\r\nwho have done their whole duty in sustaining their Government during\r\nthis terrible war. The bones of our soldiers are moldering in the soil\r\nof every rebel State. They have stood around our flag in the deadly\r\nhail of every battle of the war. The State of Wisconsin has six\r\nRepresentatives on this floor. South Carolina has three hundred\r\nthousand white inhabitants, disloyal, who have done all in their power\r\nto overthrow and destroy the Government, and yet, sir, under the\r\nConstitution as it now stands, the three hundred thousand disloyal\r\nwhite inhabitants of South Carolina will exercise as much political\r\npower in the Government as the eight hundred thousand loyal people of\r\nthe State of Wisconsin.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sloan called attention to a proposition which he had submitted to\r\nthe preceding Congress, providing that the right of representation\r\nshould be based upon the right of suffrage--upon the numbers allowed\r\nthe right to vote in the respective States.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a supposed objection to this plan, that \"there might be\r\nsome inequality in the representation of the respective States,\" he\r\nsaid: \"We all know that the young men of the old States go out in\r\nlarge numbers to settle in the new States and Territories, while the\r\nwomen and children do not emigrate to so great an extent, and hence\r\nthere would be a larger number of voters in the new States in\r\nproportion to population than in the old. And yet this is a\r\nconsideration which, in my judgment, ought not to weigh a hair with\r\nany member on this floor. It would be only a temporary inequality. In\r\nthe rapidly increasing settlement and in the natural increase of\r\npopulation of our new States, that inequality would very soon be\r\nentirely swept away. I believe the difference to-day between\r\nMassachusetts and Wisconsin would be very slight, if any, so rapid has\r\nbeen the increase of our population and the settlement of our State.\r\nWe are now proposing to adopt an amendment to the Constitution which\r\nwe expect to stand for all time, and any temporary inequality which\r\ncould continue but for a few years ought not to have any weight.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks, of New York, thought that Mr. Stevens would better \"at the\r\nstart have named what are States of this Union. The opinion of the\r\nhonorable gentleman himself, that there are no States in this Union\r\nbut those that are now represented upon this floor, I know full well;\r\nbut he knows as well that the President of the United States\r\nrecognizes thirty-six States of this Union, and that it is necessary\r\nto obtain the consent of three-fourths of those thirty-six States,\r\nwhich number it is not possible to obtain. He knows very well that if\r\nhis amendment should be adopted by the Legislatures of States enough,\r\nin his judgment, to carry it, before it could pass the tribunal of the\r\nExecutive chamber it would be obliged to receive the assent of\r\ntwenty-seven States in order to become an amendment to the\r\nConstitution.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brooks, in the course of his speech, presented a petition from\r\ncertain ladies of New York, asking an amendment of the Constitution,\r\nprohibiting the several States from disfranchising any of their\r\ncitizens on the ground of sex. He then proposed to amend the joint\r\nresolution by inserting the words \"or sex\" after the word \"color,\" so\r\nthat it would read, \"_Provided_, That whenever the elective franchise\r\nshall be denied or abridged in any State on account of race or color\r\nor sex, all persons of such race or color or sex shall be excluded\r\nfrom the basis of representation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the gentleman in favor of that amendment?\" asked Mr. Stevens.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" replied Mr. Brooks, \"if negroes are allowed to vote.\"\r\n\r\n\"That does not answer my question,\" said Mr. Stevens.\r\n\r\n\"I suggested that I would move it at a convenient time,\" said Mr.\r\nBrooks.\r\n\r\n\"Is the gentleman in favor of his own amendment?\" Mr. Stevens again\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"I am in favor of my own color in preference to any other color, and I\r\nprefer the white women of my country to the negro,\" was the response\r\nof Mr. Brooks, which was followed by applause in the galleries.\r\n\r\nMr. Orth, of Indiana, obtained the floor for the purpose of offering\r\nan amendment, which he prefaced with the following remarks: \"My\r\nposition is that the true principle of representation in Congress is\r\nthat voters alone should form the basis, and that each voter should\r\nhave equal political weight in our Government; that the voter in\r\nMassachusetts should have the same but no greater power than the voter\r\nin Indiana; and that the voter in Indiana should have the same power,\r\nbut no greater, than the voter in the State of South Carolina. The\r\ngentleman from Maine, however, states that the census tables will show\r\nthat by the amendment which I desire to offer at this time you will\r\ncurtail the representative power of the State of Massachusetts. And\r\nwhy? Because he has shown by his figures that although Massachusetts\r\nhas a male population of 529,244, her voting population is only\r\n175,487, being a percentage of twenty-nine, while Indiana, with a\r\nwhite male population of 693,469, has a voting population of 280,655,\r\nbeing about forty per cent. Why is this difference? Is it because our\r\nvoting population is so much greater in proportion than the voting\r\npopulation of Massachusetts? Not at all. The difference arises from\r\nthe fact that the State of Massachusetts has seen fit to exclude a\r\nportion of her citizens from the ballot-box. Indiana has done the same\r\nthing. Indiana has excluded one class of citizens; Massachusetts has\r\nexcluded another class. Indiana has seen fit, for reasons best known\r\nto herself, to exclude the colored population from the right of\r\nsuffrage; Massachusetts, on the contrary, has seen fit to exclude from\r\nthe ballot-box those of her citizens who can not read or write. While\r\nwe in Indiana are governed by a prejudice of color, the people of\r\nMassachusetts, I might say, are governed by a prejudice as regards\r\nignorance. But here is the difference: under the amendment that I\r\npropose, while Indiana excludes the black man from the right to\r\nparticipate in the decisions of the ballot-box, she does not ask that\r\nthe black man shall be represented on this floor. On the contrary,\r\nwhile Massachusetts excludes black and white persons who can not read\r\nand write, she yet asks that that population excluded from the ballot\r\nshall have representation on this floor. I regard this as wrong in\r\ntheory, wrong in principle, and injurious to the State which I have\r\nthe honor to represent, giving to Massachusetts a power upon this\r\nfloor of which my State is deprived. Why? Because the exclusion which\r\ndrives from the ballot-box in Massachusetts a large portion of her\r\ncitizens, yet admits them to representative power on this floor.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Orth's amendment proposed that Representatives should \"be\r\napportioned among the several States according to the number of male\r\ncitizens over twenty-one years of age, having the qualifications\r\nrequisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State\r\nLegislature.\" There being objection to the reception of this amendment\r\nunder the rules of the House, it could not be considered.\r\n\r\nMr. Chanler, of New York, alluding to Mr. Stevens' desire to have the\r\njoint resolution passed on the day of its introduction, before the sun\r\nwent down, said: \"Sir, this measure, if passed, will tend to obscure\r\nthe sun from which the liberties of this country derive their\r\nnourishment and life, the brilliant orb, the Constitution, whose light\r\nhas spread itself to the farthest ends of the earth. The vital\r\nprinciple of that Constitution, the soul of its being, is that balance\r\nof power between the States which insures individual liberty to every\r\ncitizen of each State, and harmony among all the States of the Union.\r\n\r\n\"I affirm, sir, that the discussion of this subject in the\r\nConstitutional Convention of 1787 was conducted in a spirit worthy of\r\na great people, and resulted in the noble instrument under whose\r\nauthority we now live. That era furnishes us a sad comparison with the\r\npresent epoch, when it may well be said that our Rome has 'lost the\r\nbreed of noble bloods,' and when, so far as the agitation of these\r\nfanatical and partisan questions is concerned, reason seems to have\r\n'fled to brutish beasts.' How differently and with what wise\r\nmoderation did the framers of the Constitution act! No narrow and\r\nfanatical partisanship marks their opinions or their acts.\"\r\n\r\nAfter reading an extract from Curtis' History of the Constitution, Mr.\r\nChanler, contrasting former legislation with the present on the\r\nsubject of suffrage, said: \"From the above historical statement, it\r\nwill be found that the framers of the Constitution considered the\r\nquestion of suffrage of so vital importance in fixing the balance of\r\npower between the States, that it was, after full discussion in\r\nCongress by the whole body, referred to a select committee of one from\r\neach State, again reported and fully discussed, and then referred to a\r\ncommittee of five, whose thorough examination of the subject gave rise\r\nto new difficulties, and caused the matter to be referred to another\r\ncommittee of one member from each State. All differences were\r\ncompromised in a spirit of patriotism and justice. How different is\r\nall this from the hasty partisan legislation on this very suffrage\r\nquestion by the present Congress!\r\n\r\n\"A caucus met before Congress organized, and chalked out a line of\r\npolicy and action for the Republican party on the floor of Congress.\r\nThe whole matter of reconstruction was referred to a grinding\r\ncommittee, whose dictation should govern Congress in every measure\r\nbrought before it for consideration. Is this wise, just, or\r\nreasonable? I hold that this resolution is too narrow to be of use and\r\ntoo weak to last. It will totter to an untimely grave, and hobble, a\r\nfeeble and contemptible instrument, from this Congress to every State\r\nLegislature to which it may be submitted, to be rejected for its\r\nfeebleness in a time like this, amid the overwhelming issues which\r\nagitate this country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Farnsworth, of Illinois, remarked: \"It is necessary, it seems to\r\nme, that whatever constitutional provision we may make should be made\r\nclear, manifest, certain. If possible, we should make it enforce\r\nitself, so that by no cunningly-devised scheme or shift can they\r\nnullify it. It seems to me that the resolution reported by the joint\r\nCommittee on Reconstruction is not so clear as it ought to be; I am\r\nafraid that it will be worthless. A State may enact that a man shall\r\nnot exercise the elective franchise except he can read and write,\r\nmaking that law apply equally to the whites and blacks, and then may\r\nalso enact that a black man shall not learn to read and write, exclude\r\nhim from their schools, and make it a penal offense to instruct or to\r\nteach him, and thus prevent his qualifying to exercise the elective\r\nfranchise according to the State law. And they may do in regard to the\r\nelective franchise just what they are doing now in regard to slavery.\r\nThey may provide that no man shall exercise the elective franchise who\r\nhas been guilty of a crime, and then they may denounce these men as\r\nguilty of a crime for every little, imaginary, petty offense. They may\r\ndeclare that no man shall exercise the right of voting who has not a\r\nregular business or occupation by which he may obtain a livelihood,\r\nand then they may declare that the black man has no settled occupation\r\nand no business. It seems to me, therefore, necessary that we should,\r\nby some provision in this amendment, settle this beyond a\r\nperadventure, so that none of these shifts or devices may defeat the\r\npurpose of the enactment.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Farnsworth was in favor of more radical remedies: \"I protest here\r\nthat I will not accept any such constitutional amendment as this as a\r\nsubstitute for that full measure of justice which it is our duty to\r\nmete out. I will not promise that hereafter I will not propose, and\r\nvote for, and advocate with whatever power I possess, a measure which\r\nwill give to all the people of the States that which is their due. By\r\nno vote of mine shall there be incorporated in the Constitution a\r\nprovision which shall, even by implication, declare that a State may\r\ndisfranchise any portion of its citizens on account of race or color.\r\nWe have no right to give our countenance to any such injustice. All\r\nprovisions in reference to representation which are based upon any\r\nother principle than that of the people of this country, who are the\r\nsubjects of government, have the right to vote and to be represented,\r\nare false in principle. Such a measure may, perhaps, answer for a\r\ntemporary expedient, but it will not do as a fundamental rule to be\r\nembodied in the Constitution for the people of this country to live\r\nby. I deny that a State has the right to disfranchise a majority or\r\neven a minority of its citizens because of class or race. And I say\r\nthat that provision of the Constitution which makes it the duty of the\r\nGeneral Government to 'guarantee to every State in this Union a\r\nrepublican form of government' ought to be taken into consideration by\r\nthis Congress and enforced. Does a State that denies the elective\r\nfranchise to one-half of its citizens possess a republican form of\r\ngovernment? Where a large portion of the citizens of a State--the men\r\nwho are required to pay taxes and perform military duty, to contribute\r\ntheir money and their strength in support of the Government--are\r\ndenied the elective franchise, is that a republican form of\r\ngovernment? I say that it is a libel upon republicanism; it is not a\r\nrepublican form of government; it is neither republican in form nor in\r\nsubstance.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Baker, of Illinois, although anxious to have an amendment of the\r\nConstitution \"achieving the general purpose of supplying a more just\r\nbasis of representation,\" saw points of objection to the proposition\r\nbefore the House, some of which had been raised by previous speakers.\r\nHe said: \"I am reluctant to indorse an amendment to the Constitution\r\nframed in this day of growing liberty, framed by the party of\r\nprogress, intended to make representative power in this Government\r\ncorrespond with the quantum of political justice on which it is based,\r\nand yet which leaves any State in the Union perfectly free to narrow\r\nher suffrage to any extent she pleases, imposing proprietary and other\r\ndisqualifying tests, and still strengthening her aristocratic power in\r\nthe Government by the full count of her disfranchised people, provided\r\nonly she steers clear of a test based on race or color.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jenckes was desirous of having a more just and comprehensive\r\nenactment than the one proposed: \"In my judgment,\" said he, \"justice\r\nrequires that the qualification of electors for members of this House\r\nand for electors of President and Vice-President of the United\r\nStates--in other words, for the two popular branches of this great\r\nGovernment--should be defined in the fundamental law. Upon this point\r\nlet me quote the words of Madison, written in his mature years to a\r\ndistinguished son of the republic seeking advice from him. He says:\r\n'The right of suffrage, the rule of apportioning representation, and\r\nthe mode of appointing to and removing from office, are fundamentals\r\nin a free government, and ought to be fixed by the Constitution.'\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, sir, it is less difficult, in a Congress composed of less\r\nthan three hundred men, to agree to a proposition which will meet the\r\nviews of the whole country on this question of suffrage than to adopt\r\na proposition which, when submitted to and adopted by the requisite\r\nnumber of States, must be carried into effect by as many Legislatures\r\nas there are States, and in a different manner by each, and which, in\r\nbeing carried into effect, must be acted upon by as many thousands of\r\nmen in State conventions and Legislatures as there are hundreds in\r\nthis Congress.\r\n\r\n\"There is no equality, and there can be no equality, in the proposed\r\namendment. It seems to me, therefore, if we undertake to amend the\r\nfundamental law at all in this respect, we ought to agree upon what\r\nshould be the qualification of voters for members of this House,\r\nembodying them in the proposed amendments to submit to the\r\nLegislatures of the States. Then there would be a definite\r\nproposition; and that, I believe, if it emanated from this House,\r\nwould have substantial equality and justice--would have the elements\r\nof equality and uniformity, and be enforced without difficulty in\r\nevery State of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to a mode which might be adopted for evading the legitimate\r\nresults of the proposed amendment, Mr. Jenckes remarked: \"I was\r\nalluding to another one. Some of the Southern States, up to the\r\nbreaking out of the war, had constitutions which prescribed a property\r\nqualification. Suppose this amendment were adopted, and the State of\r\nSouth Carolina chose to annul the Constitution recently proclaimed and\r\nto go back to that of 1790, and that the word 'white' should be\r\nstricken out of it, I desire to ask how many freedmen, how many\r\npersons of African descent, can be found who own in fee fifty acres of\r\nland or a town lot, or who have paid a tax of three shillings\r\nsterling. As far as I can ascertain from the statistics, there would\r\nnot be, if that constitution were restored and the word 'white'\r\nomitted, over five hundred additional qualified voters in that State.\r\n\r\n\"Ever since the adoption of the Constitution of 1790 down to the time\r\nof firing on Fort Sumter, South Carolina was in practical relation to\r\nthis Government as a State of this Union. She had been considered as\r\nhaving a republican form of government, and that which we had\r\nguaranteed as such for many years we would be bound to guarantee to\r\nher hereafter. Stronger than ever this oligarchy would be enthroned\r\nupon their old seat of power, not upheld merely by slaves beneath it,\r\nbut by the power of the General Government above and around it. She\r\nmight make any of the discriminations which I have suggested, of age,\r\nof residence, of previous servitude, and of ignorance or poverty.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trimble, of Kentucky, was \"exceedingly gratified at the\r\ndisposition manifested among the party in opposition here, by reason\r\nof their own differences of opinion, to allow an opportunity to us to\r\npresent our objections to the measure now under consideration. This\r\nsubject of amending the Constitution under which we have lived so\r\nlong, so happily, and so prosperously, is one of great moment; and\r\nwhile I have some confidence in the ability and capacity of some of\r\nthe friends on the opposite side to make a constitution, yet I prefer\r\nthe Constitution as made by our fathers eighty years ago.\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion, the amendment proposed is in violation of the reserved\r\nrights of the people of the States under that instrument. The object\r\nand purpose of this resolution is to enfranchise a million men in this\r\ncountry whom no political party in this country ever had the boldness\r\nto propose the enfranchisement of prior to the present session of\r\nCongress. I remember that, in 1860 and 1861, the party known in this\r\ncountry as the Union party took the ground, from one end of the\r\ncountry to the other, that neither Congress nor the people of the\r\nStates had the power, under the Constitution of the United States, to\r\ninterfere with slavery in the States where it existed; much less, sir,\r\ndid they claim the power not only to destroy it, but to strike down\r\nthe provisions of the Constitution that protected me and my\r\nconstituents in our right to our property. Sir, there was an amendment\r\nsubmitted then for the purpose of peace, for the purpose of restoring\r\npeace and quiet throughout the country. It met, at the time, my hearty\r\nsupport, and I regret, from the bottom of my heart, that the people,\r\nNorth, South, East, and West, did not agree to that proposition, and\r\nmake it part and parcel of the Constitution. I refer to the amendment\r\nproposed in 1861, declaring that Congress should never thereafter\r\ninterfere with the question of slavery in the States.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it is a well-established principle that no one should be\r\npermitted to take advantage of his own wrong. If the party in power\r\nhave succeeded in freeing the slaves of the South, ought they not, at\r\nleast, to allow the Southern States to enjoy the increased\r\nrepresentation to which, according to the rule established by the\r\nConstitution, they are now entitled? Or, if the Northern States\r\nsincerely desire that the negroes of the South shall vote and shall be\r\nrepresented in Congress, let them transport those negroes to the North\r\nand take them under their guardianship; they are welcome to them.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that the people of Kentucky, whom I in part represent, and\r\nI have no doubt the people of the whole South, will submit in good\r\nfaith to the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. While they\r\nmay believe that the amendment is revolutionary and unjust, in\r\nviolation of the rights of Kentucky and the South, still the Southern\r\nStates, having in a way yielded up this question, for representation\r\nand peace, they will stand by the Constitution as amended.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. Trimble presented the following argument against the\r\nmeasure: \"This proposition is a direct attack upon the President of\r\nthe United States; it is a direct attack upon the doctrines and\r\nprinciples taught by that distinguished man now holding the\r\npresidential chair. This amendment is in violation, in my judgment, of\r\nevery principle that that man has held from his boyhood up to the\r\npresent hour. Sir, the President of the United States does not believe\r\nthat the Congress of the United States has the right, or that the\r\npeople have the right, to strike down the inalienable right of the\r\nStates to settle for themselves who shall be clothed with that high\r\nprivilege--suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject being resumed on the following day, January 24th, Mr.\r\nLawrence, of Ohio, addressed the House, premising his remarks by a\r\nmotion that the resolution and amendments be recommitted to the\r\nCommittee on Reconstruction, \"with instructions to report an amendment\r\nto the Constitution which shall, first, apportion direct taxes among\r\nthe States according to property in each; and which shall, second,\r\napportion Representatives among the States on the basis of adult male\r\nvoters who may be citizens of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nHe argued that \"the rule which gave representation to three-fifths of\r\nthe slave population was wrong in principle, and unjust in practical\r\nresults. It was purely arbitrary, the result of compromise, and not of\r\nfixed political principles, or of any standard of abstract justice. If\r\nslavery was a just element of political strength, I know of no rule\r\nwhich could properly divide it into 'fractional quantities;' if it was\r\nnot a just element of political strength, I know of no rule which\r\ncould properly give it 'fractional power.'\r\n\r\n\"The basis of representation was unjust in practical results, because\r\nit gave to chattel slavery political power--a power accorded to no\r\nother species of property--thus making what the slave States regarded\r\nas wealth an element of political strength.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having given a statistical table showing how representation was\r\napportioned among the several States having free and slave population,\r\nMr. Lawrence deduced the following facts: \"New Hampshire, with a white\r\npopulation of 325,579, has but three Representatives, while Louisiana,\r\nwith a white population of 357,629, had five. California, with a white\r\npopulation of 323,177, has but three Representatives, while\r\nMississippi, with a similar population of 353,901, had five. In South\r\nCarolina 72,847 white persons had one Representative, while the ratio\r\nof representation is one for 127,000 persons.\r\n\r\n\"Under this mode of apportionment, the late slave States had eighteen\r\nRepresentatives, by the census of 1860, more than their just share, if\r\nbased on free population. The whole political power of Ohio was\r\ncounterbalanced by slave representation. It was equal to two-thirds of\r\nall the representation from New England. In South Carolina 14,569\r\nvotes carried as much political power as 25,400 in the free States.\"\r\n\r\nFreedom having been given to the slaves, \"the effect will be, so soon\r\nas lawful State Governments are created in the rebel States, to\r\nlargely increase their representation in Congress and the Electoral\r\nCollege. The slave population, by the census of 1860, was 3,950,531.\r\nThree-fifths of this, or 2,370,318, has heretofore entered into the\r\nbasis of representation. Now, the additional 1,580,213 is to be added\r\nto that basis. This will give ten additional Representatives to the\r\nlate slave States--in all twenty-eight more than their just proportion\r\nupon a basis excluding the late slaves. If this injustice can be\r\ntolerated and perpetuated, and the late rebel States shall soon be\r\nadmitted to representation, they will enjoy as the reward of their\r\nperfidy and treason an increased political power. This will reward\r\ntraitors with a liberal premium for treason.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the proper time for amending the Constitution, Mr. Lawrence\r\nsaid: \"But if ever there could be a time for making fundamental changes\r\nin our organic law, and ingrafting on it irreversible guarantees, that\r\ntime is now. The events of the past four years demonstrate their\r\nnecessity, and our security for the future imperatively demands them\r\nat our hands. The great events which have transpired, and the altered\r\ncircumstances that surround us, admonish us that we will be recreant\r\nto our trusts if we fail to inscribe justice on the Constitution, and\r\nfortify it against the encroachments of treason, so that it shall be\r\neternal. One of the elements of our past misfortunes, and which gave\r\npower for evil to the enemies who assailed us in this temple, was\r\nunequal and unjust representation--political power wielded by a\r\ndominant class, augmented by concessions on behalf of a disfranchised\r\nand servile race, insultingly declared almost in the very citadel of\r\nnational justice as having no rights which a white man was bound to\r\nrespect. By this amendment we strike down the iniquity of one class\r\nwielding political power for another, and arrogant because in the\r\nexercise of unjust power.\"\r\n\r\nMaintaining that representation should be based upon suffrage, Mr.\r\nLawrence said: \"The reason which conclusively justifies it is, that a\r\npeople declared by law, if in fact unprepared for suffrage, should not\r\nbe represented as an element of power by those interested in forever\r\nkeeping them unprepared. But children never can be qualified and\r\ncompetent depositaries of political power, and, therefore, should not\r\nenter into the basis of representation. It never has been deemed\r\nnecessary for the protection of females that they should be regarded\r\nas an element of political power, and hence they should not be an\r\nelement of representation. If the necessity shall come, or if our\r\nsense of justice should so change as to enfranchise adult females, it\r\nwill be time enough then to make them a basis of representation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shellabarger, of Ohio, though having \"fifteen times as much\r\nrespect for the opinions of the Committee on Reconstruction\" as for\r\nhis own, yet suggested the following as objections to their report:\r\n\r\n\"1. It contemplates and provides for, and in that way, taken by\r\nitself, authorizes the States to wholly disfranchise entire races of\r\nits people, and that, too, whether that race be white or black, Saxon,\r\nCeltic, or Caucasian, and without regard to their numbers or\r\nproportion to the entire population of the State.\r\n\r\n\"2. It is a declaration made in the Constitution of the only great and\r\nfree republic in the world, that it is permissible and right to deny\r\nto the races of men all their political rights, and that it is\r\npermissible to make them the hewers of wood and drawers of water, the\r\nmud-sills of society, provided only you do not ask to have these\r\ndisfranchised races represented in that Government, provided you\r\nwholly ignore them in the State. The moral teaching of the clause\r\noffends the free and just spirit of the age, violates the foundation\r\nprinciples of our own Government, and is intrinsically wrong.\r\n\r\n\"3. The clause, by being inserted into the Constitution, and being\r\nmade the companion of its other clauses, thereby construes and gives\r\nnew meanings to those other clauses; and it thus lets down and spoils\r\nthe free spirit and sense of the Constitution. Associated with that\r\nclause relating to the States being 'republican,' it makes it read\r\nthus: 'The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union\r\na republican form of government;' provided, however, that a government\r\nshall be deemed to be republican when whole races of its people are\r\nwholly disfranchised, unrepresented, and ignored.\r\n\r\n\"4. The report of the committee imposes no adequate restraint upon\r\nthis disfranchisement of races and creation of oligarchies in the\r\nStates, because after a race is disfranchised in a State it gives to\r\none vote cast in such State by the ruling race just the same power as\r\na vote has in a State where no one is disfranchised.\r\n\r\n\"5. These words of the amendment, to-wit, 'denied or abridged on\r\naccount of color,' admit of dangerous construction, and also of an\r\nevasion of the avowed intent of the committee. Thus, for example, the\r\nAfrican race may, in fact, be disfranchised in the States, and yet\r\nenumerated as part of the basis of representation, by means of a\r\nprovision disfranchising all who were slaves, or all whose ancestors\r\nwere slaves.\r\n\r\n\"6. The pending proposition of the committee is a radical departure\r\nfrom the principles of representative republican government, in this,\r\nthat it does not provide for nor secure the absolute political\r\nequality of the people, or, relatively, of the States. It does not\r\nsecure to each vote throughout the Government absolute equality in its\r\ngoverning force. It, for example, permits twenty-five thousand votes\r\nin New York city to elect two members of Congress, provided one-half\r\nof its population should happen to be foreigners unnaturalized, and\r\nnot electors of the State, whom the law deems unfit to vote; whereas,\r\ntwenty-five thousand votes in Ohio would elect but one member of\r\nCongress, provided her citizens were all Americans instead of\r\nforeigners.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Eliot submitted an amendment to the effect that population should\r\nbe the basis of representation, and that \"the elective franchise shall\r\nnot be denied or abridged in any State on account of race or color.\"\r\nHe stated the following grounds of objection to the resolution offered\r\nby the committee: \"First, the amendment as it is now reported from the\r\ncommittee is objectionable, to my mind, because it admits by\r\nimplication that a State has the right to disfranchise large masses of\r\nits citizens. No man can show that in that Constitution which the\r\nfathers made, and under which we have lived, the right is recognized\r\nin any State to disfranchise large masses of its citizens because of\r\nrace. And I do not want now, at this day, that the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, for the purpose of effecting a practical good, shall\r\nput into the Constitution of the land any language which would seem to\r\nrecognize that right.\r\n\r\n\"The next objection I have to the amendment is this: that it enables a\r\nState, consistently with its provisions, by making the right to vote\r\ndepend upon a property qualification, to exclude large classes of men\r\nof both races. A State may legislate in such a way as to be, in fact,\r\nan oligarchy, and not a republican State. South Carolina may legislate\r\nso as to provide that no man shall have the right to vote unless he\r\npossesses an annual income of $1,000, and holds real estate to the\r\namount of five hundred acres. Every one sees that that would exclude\r\nmultitudes of all classes of citizens, making the State no longer\r\nrepublican, but oligarchical. Yet gentlemen say that under the\r\nConstitution Congress is bound to see to it that each State shall have\r\na republican form of government.\r\n\r\n\"The third objection I have to this amendment is, that it controls by\r\nimplication that power; because, while the Constitution now says that\r\nCongress shall guarantee to every State a republican form of\r\ngovernment, this amendment, as reported by the committee, admits by\r\nimplication that, although a State may so legislate as to exclude\r\nthese multitudes of men, not on account of race or color, but on\r\naccount of property, yet, nevertheless, she would have a republican\r\nform of government, and that Congress will not and ought not to\r\ninterfere.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pike, of Maine, had, on the assembling of Congress after the\r\nholidays, offered a resolution, expressing the idea contained in the\r\nreport of the committee, but on reflection had come to the conclusion\r\nthat the resolution would not accomplish the purpose desired. He\r\nstated his reasons for changing his opinion. He thought that the\r\nprovisions of the proposed amendment might be evaded. \"Suppose,\" said\r\nhe, \"this constitutional amendment in full force, and a State should\r\nprovide that the right of suffrage should not be exercised by any\r\nperson who had been a slave, or who was the descendant of a slave,\r\nwhatever his race or color. I submit that it is a serious matter of\r\ndoubt whether or not that simple provision would not be sufficient to\r\ndefeat this constitutional amendment which we here so laboriously\r\nenact and submit to the States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Conkling thought that this criticism could have no practical\r\nimportance, from the fact that the proposed amendment was to operate\r\nin this country, where one race, and only one, has been held in\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nMr. Pike replied: \"In no State in the South has slavery been confined\r\nto any one race. So far as I am acquainted with their statutes, in no\r\nState has slavery been confined to the African race. I know of no\r\nslave statute, and I have examined the matter with some care, which\r\nsays that Africans alone shall be slaves. So much for race. As to\r\ncolor, it was a common thing throughout the whole South to advertise\r\nrunaway slaves as having light hair and blue eyes, and all the\r\nindications of the Caucasian race, and 'passing themselves off for\r\nwhite men.' I say further to the honorable gentleman from New York,\r\nthat well-authenticated instances exist in every slave State where men\r\nof Caucasian descent, of Anglo-Saxon blood, have been confined in\r\nslavery, and they and their posterity held as slaves; so that not only\r\nfree blacks were found every-where, but white slaves also abounded.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kelley, who next addressed the House, also brought proof to\r\ncontrovert the \"hasty assertion\" that but one race had been enslaved:\r\n\"The assertion that white persons have been sold into slavery does not\r\ndepend on common report, but is proven by the reports of the superior\r\ncourts of almost every Southern State. One poor German woman, who had\r\narrived in our country at thirteen years of age, was released from\r\nslavery by the Supreme Court of Louisiana, but not until she had\r\nbecome the mother of three mulatto children, her owner having mated\r\nher with one of his darker slaves. Toward the close of the last\r\ncentury, the Supreme Court of New Jersey decided that American Indians\r\ncould be reduced to and legally held in slavery. And so long ago as\r\n1741 white slave women were so common in North Carolina, that the\r\nLegislature passed a law dooming to slavery the child of every 'white\r\nservant woman' born of an Indian father.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kelley thought that the enforcement of this long-dormant power of\r\nthe Constitution would be for the benefit not merely of the poor, the\r\nignorant, and the weak, but also of the wise, \"the strong, and the\r\nwealthy of our country.\" \"There is now pending,\" said he, \"before the\r\nLegislature of regenerated and, as gentlemen would have us believe,\r\nreconstructed Virginia, a bill to require five years' residence on the\r\npart of citizens of other States who may invest their capital and\r\nsettle within the sacred limits of the Old Dominion before they can\r\nacquire citizenship. If they may pass a limitation of five years, why\r\nmay they not pass a limitation of fifty? Why will not any limitation\r\nthat comes within the ordinary duration of human life be admissible?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bromwell, obtaining the floor, inquired whether the question was\r\nin such condition that any amendment or substitute could be offered.\r\nThe Speaker replied: \"Six amendments are pending now. The only one\r\nthat could be offered would be to amend the amendment of the gentleman\r\nfrom Pennsylvania, [Mr. Stevens,] which was, to add the word 'therein'\r\nin the fifteenth line. No other amendment would be in order now, the\r\nwhole legislative power to amend being exhausted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bromwell had desired to offer an amendment which, in his opinion,\r\nwould obviate many of the objections to pending joint resolution, and\r\nthe amendments thereto; but the way not being open for this, he\r\naddressed the House in a brief speech. He said: \"When this amendment\r\nwas introduced, on last Monday morning, the differences of opinion\r\nwhich have been developed in reference to the principles of the\r\namendment were not anticipated. But to-day we see that it has, so far,\r\nnot an advocate upon this floor. Such may be the result with every\r\namendment which may be presented. It is difficult to see, among all\r\nthe amendments which are now pending, any one of them, or any\r\ncombination of them, that will meet the desire of the majority, not to\r\nsay two-thirds of this House. I apprehend that the members of this\r\nHouse desire to act so as to secure the support of a proper majority\r\nhere. I apprehend, also, that they desire to make this amendment such\r\nthat it will meet with the sanction of a sufficient number of the\r\nStates of the Union to make it effectual. Now, sir, it is in vain for\r\nthis Congress to launch an amendment which shall die on the road\r\nthrough the Legislatures.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the difficulties in the way of all the plans proposed,\r\nMr. Bromwell was heartily in favor of modifying the basis of\r\nrepresentation. \"I think,\" said he, \"seventy years is long enough for\r\nfifteen, twenty, or thirty Representatives to sit here and make laws\r\nto apply to Northern people, with no constituencies behind them. I\r\nthink it has been seen long enough that a large number of persons\r\ncalled property, made property by the laws of the States, shall give\r\nto the oligarchs of those particular districts of country the right to\r\noutvote the independent men of the North, of the free States, where\r\nsome approximation has been made to securing God-given rights to all\r\ninhabitants. I think that it is wrong that the further a State recedes\r\nfrom common right and common justice the more power the oligarchy\r\nwhich controls it shall grasp in their hands; and I desire that this\r\namendment shall be made so that it shall bear down upon that abuse\r\nwith the crushing power of three-fourths of the legislatures of the\r\nUnion.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the House had heard so many objectors to the basis of\r\nrepresentation, as proposed by the committee, Mr. Cook, of Illinois,\r\ntook the floor in favor of the measure. He said: \"We have now, as I\r\nbelieve, the golden opportunity to remedy this evil which will never\r\ncome again to the men of this generation. The system of slavery has\r\nfallen. The States whose representation was increased by it have, with\r\ntwo or three exceptions, destroyed their loyal and legal State\r\ngovernments, and now seek reconstruction. The adoption of this\r\namendment by the States lately in rebellion should be one of the\r\nguarantees to be insisted upon as a condition precedent to their\r\ntaking equal authority and rank in the Union with the loyal States.\"\r\n\r\nTo the proposition that the basis of representation should be voters\r\nonly, Mr. Cook presented the following objections:\r\n\r\n\"1. It is difficult to enumerate voters accurately; their\r\nqualifications are fixed by State laws. We can not send Federal\r\nofficers into every State to adjudicate, in disputed cases, the rights\r\nof those claiming to be voters under the State laws, as we should have\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n\"2. It would not be just; the voters of the country are unequally\r\ndistributed. The old States have fewer, the new States more, voters\r\naccording to the white population. In other words, there is a greater\r\nproportion of women and children in the old States. These should be\r\nand are represented. They are represented, in the true sense of that\r\nword, by their fathers and brothers. The man who represents them does\r\nso really and practically, and not by legal fiction, like the man who\r\nrepresents 'three-fifths of all other persons.'\r\n\r\n\"3. It takes from the basis of representation all unnaturalized\r\nforeigners. I do not wish to discuss the question whether this would\r\nbe judicious or not, but I do not want a measure of this almost\r\nsupreme importance loaded down with these questions, and its passage\r\njeopardized by the incorporation of provisions which, would render it\r\nso liable to attack and misrepresentation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cook referred as follows to some objections urged against the\r\nbasis of representation proposed by the Reconstruction Committee: \"It\r\nis said that the Southern States may impose a property qualification,\r\nand so exclude the negroes, not on account of race or color, but for\r\nwant of a property qualification, or that they might provide for a\r\nqualification of intelligence, and so disfranchise the negroes because\r\nthey could not read or write, and still enumerate them. To do this\r\nthey must first repeal all the laws now denying suffrage to negroes;\r\nand, second, provide qualifications which will disfranchise half their\r\nwhite voters; two things neither of which will, in any human\r\nprobability, occur. And in the event that it was possible that both\r\nthese measures should be adopted, and all the blacks and half the\r\nwhites disqualified, it would become a grave question whether the\r\nprovision of the Constitution which requires the United States to\r\nguarantee to each State a republican form of government would not\r\nauthorize the Government to rectify so gross a wrong. There is no\r\nmeasure to which fanciful objections may not be urged; but I believe\r\nthis to be the least objectionable of any measure which has been\r\nsuggested to meet this evil. But above all, I am well persuaded that\r\nit is the only measure that can meet the approval of three-fourths of\r\nthe States; consequently, that this is the only practical measure\r\nbefore the House.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall, of Illinois, declared the proposition, as reported by\r\nthe committee, to be \"wholly untenable, is monstrous, absurd, damnable\r\nin its provisions, a greater wrong and outrage on the black race than\r\nany thing that has ever been advocated by others.\"\r\n\r\nHe thus set forth the measure in the light of injustice to the negro:\r\n\"The gentlemen who report it profess to be, and doubtless are, the\r\npeculiar advocates of the African race. I wish to ask them upon what\r\nprinciple of justice, upon what principle of free government, they\r\nhave provided that if, after this amendment is adopted, South\r\nCarolina, Mississippi, or any other State shall adopt a provision that\r\nall white men over twenty-one years of age shall be voters, and all\r\nblack men who have two hundred dollars' worth of property, and if\r\nthere shall be ten thousand legal black voters in such State, upon\r\nwhat principle will you place in the Constitution of the United States\r\na provision which would deprive these ten thousand legal black voters\r\nof any representation upon the floor of Congress, or of being\r\nconsidered in the basis of representation? And I wish to ask the\r\nhonorable gentleman who reported this amendment if that is not the\r\neffect and result of the amendment reported from the committee.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to the time and place of inaugurating constitutional\r\namendments, Mr. Marshall used the following language: \"If any\r\namendments are necessary to the Constitution of our country, this is\r\nnot the time, and more especially is this not the place, to inaugurate\r\nsuch amendments. I believe, notwithstanding the conceded wisdom,\r\nability, and virtue of this House, that the fathers who framed our\r\nglorious Constitution were wiser, better, and nobler than we are; yet\r\nevery day we have offered here some dozen or twenty proposed\r\namendments to the Constitution, offered as if we were discussing\r\nresolutions in a town meeting.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robert C. Schenck.]\r\n\r\nAmong the propositions before the House relating to this subject, was\r\nan amendment proposed by Mr. Schenck, of Ohio, providing that\r\nrepresentation should be based upon \"the number of male citizens of\r\nthe United States over twenty-one years of age, having the\r\nqualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of\r\nthe State legislature.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Schenck addressed the House, and thus gave a history of his own\r\nconnection with the measure: \"At a very early day in this session, I\r\nwas one of those disposed to ask the attention of Congress to the\r\nsubject, to propose in proper form the submission of the question to\r\nthe Legislatures of the several States. On the first day of the\r\nsession, on the 4th of December last, as soon as the House was\r\norganized, I gave notice that I would on the next, or some succeeding\r\nday, introduce a proposition to amend the Constitution. On the ensuing\r\nday I did accordingly present a joint resolution. It stands as House\r\nResolution No. 1 of the session.\r\n\r\n\"In that I propose representation hereafter shall be based upon\r\nsuffrage. I propose that representation shall be apportioned among the\r\nseveral States of the Union according to the number of voters having\r\nqualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of\r\nthe Legislature of the State where they reside, following in this the\r\nlanguage of the Constitution; these voters, however, to be further\r\nlimited in their descriptions and definitions as being male citizens\r\nof the United States over twenty-one years of age. Now, whether the\r\nproposition be a good one or not; whether the limitation be such as\r\nshould commend itself to the masses of our people, I will not for the\r\npresent inquire. I will only remark they have seemed to me to embrace\r\nas many qualifications as we ought to include when we are going to lay\r\ndown a new organic law on this subject.\"\r\n\r\nAn objection urged by Mr. Schenck against the plan proposed by the\r\ncommittee was, that it failed to offer inducements for a gradual\r\nenfranchisement of the negro. He said: \"Now, sir, I am not one of\r\nthose who entertain Utopian ideas in relation, not merely to the\r\nprogress, but to the immediate change of sentiment, opinions, and\r\npractice among the people of those States that have so lately been\r\nslave States, and so recently in rebellion. I believe that, like all\r\nother people, their growth toward good and right and free institutions\r\nmust necessarily be gradual; and if we pass the amendment which I have\r\nproposed, or any thing similar to it, and say to them, 'You shall have\r\nrepresentation proportioned to the portion of your population to which\r\nyou extend this inestimable franchise,' my belief is that they will\r\nnot, on the next day after it becomes a part of the organic law of the\r\nUnited States, at once enfranchise all the negroes in their midst. I\r\nam not sure that they ought to do it; but we are dealing with the\r\nmatter now as it presents itself as a practical question. What will\r\nthey probably do? My belief is, that if you persuade them to do right,\r\nif you hold out to them an inducement for letting their negroes vote,\r\nand striking out these disqualifications and putting all upon the\r\nbasis of manhood, they will probably begin, after the amendment\r\nbecomes part of the organic law, by extending this right to those who\r\nhave acquired certain property; perhaps they will also extend it,\r\nafter awhile, to those who have certain qualifications of education.\r\nHowever they may proceed, whether rapidly or slowly, it will be a work\r\nof progress and a work of time. But by this amendment you would say to\r\nthem, 'We do not want you to enter upon any such gradual bringing up\r\nof these people to the level plain of right to be enjoyed by them\r\nequally with others of other races in your midst.' We say to them,\r\n'You may enfranchise one-third or one-fourth of your people who are\r\nblack and deprived of the privilege of voting by introducing the\r\nqualification of property, up to which one-third or one-fourth may\r\ncome; you may introduce a qualification of education, up to which a\r\nnumber of them may come; but that will all be of no value; so long as\r\nthere is any denial or any abridgement of the right to vote of a\r\nsingle man on account of his race or color, you shall have no part of\r\nthe population of that race or color counted to measure to you your\r\nshare of representation.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, I will not go into the abstract question whether they ought to\r\nenfranchise the negroes at once or not; I will not go into the\r\nquestion of how soon they ought to do it as a matter of expediency; I\r\nsay that, in all human probability, when they come to enfranchise, if\r\nthey do it at all, this portion of their population, they will do it\r\ngradually; yet, by this amendment, as it comes from the committee, you\r\nsay that they shall not be represented for any part of it at all till\r\nthey completely enfranchise them and put them on the same footing with\r\nthe white population.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Mr. Schenck remarked: \"New England, if she should even\r\nlose a vote, or two votes, or a fraction of a vote, can not afford,\r\nany more than Ohio or Indiana, or any other of those States can,\r\nhaving these particular objections to the scheme, to let the\r\nopportunity go by now and not introduce a general amendment which will\r\nremedy the one great evil under which we are all laboring together. I\r\nhold that Ohio must give up her objections on account of her negro\r\npopulation; that the North-western States must give up their\r\nobjections on account of the fact that they are permitting persons to\r\nvote who are not yet citizens of the United States. Those persons\r\nwould have to wait, 'to tarry at Jericho until their beards are\r\ngrown,' I hold that New England must give up her objections; and, if\r\nwe are to amend the organic law at all, we must do it by uniting upon\r\na common principle, a common sympathy, a common feeling, at least on\r\nthis side of the House, upon which the entire responsibility is\r\nthrown, acting harmoniously, and adopting such an amendment to the\r\norganic law as shall be entirely democratic and fair in all its scope\r\nand action upon all the people of the States of this Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion was continued on the day following, Mr. Eldridge, of\r\nWisconsin, having the floor for the first speech. After having\r\nexpressed his satisfaction that the sun was allowed to go down on the\r\ndeliberations upon this resolution, he confessed himself opposed to\r\nthe amendment of the Constitution. He said: \"I believe that this is\r\nnot the time for its amendment, and I believe, further, that there are\r\nother States than those represented upon this floor which are entitled\r\nto deliberate with us on that question, and to that point I shall\r\nmainly address the remarks which I have to make at this time.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a protracted speech on the general subject of reconstruction.\r\nAt the close of his remarks, he said: \"It would much more comport with\r\nthe dignity and sense of justice of the American Congress to let the\r\nlegally elected members from the Southern States be admitted, and\r\nparticipate in the proceedings and debates, especially in matters of\r\nso great importance as a change in our organic law. Let us have a\r\nrepresentation for our whole country. Wherever the American flag\r\nfloats, from the St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico--wherever the\r\nStar-spangled Banner waves--that is our country. And let us legislate\r\nas Americans, as Representatives of our whole country, in a spirit of\r\njustice, liberality, and patriotism, and we will again have one\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Higby, of California, was opposed to the joint resolution from the\r\nfact that the proviso in the proposed amendment is in conflict with\r\nthat portion of the Constitution which requires that \"the United\r\nStates shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form\r\nof government.\" \"I say it,\" said he, \"without fear or favor, that that\r\namendment will allow any State government in its organization to\r\nexclude one-half of its population from the right of suffrage; and I\r\nsay such State governments will not be republican in form.\"\r\n\r\nIn a conversation which ensued with some members, Mr. Higby maintained\r\nthat no State excluding any class of citizens on account of race or\r\ncolor was republican in form. \"I do not believe,\" said he, \"there is a\r\nsingle State in the Union, except it may be one of the New England\r\nStates, which is an exception to that general rule.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hill, of Indiana, asked whether the gentleman would favor the\r\nHouse with his opinion as to what would be a republican form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMr. Higby was sorry that the gentleman had lived to his time of life,\r\nand obtained a position as the Representative of a large constituency,\r\nwithout finding out what a republican form of government is. \"I will\r\nask the gentleman,\" said he, \"if he thinks that those States that have\r\nexcluded and disfranchised more than half of their native population\r\nhave a republican form of government?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion,\" said Mr. Hill, \"when the framers of the Constitution\r\nplaced in that instrument the declaration or the provision that the\r\nGovernment of the United States would guarantee to each State a\r\nrepublican form of government, they spoke with reference to such\r\ngovernments as then existed, and such as those same framers recognized\r\nfor a long time afterward as republican governments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is a very good answer,\" said Mr. Higby. \"It is an answer\r\nfrom a stand-point seventy-five years ago. I speak from the\r\nstand-point of the present time.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Higby desired that the joint resolution should go back to the\r\ncommittee. He said: \"I do not wish it disposed of here, to be voted\r\ndown. I want, if it is possible, that it shall be so framed that it\r\nshall receive the full constitutional majority required, and be a\r\nproposition that shall operate with full force in all those States\r\nthat now have a great population excluded from the rights of\r\ncitizenship.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the gentleman proposes,\" said Mr. Stevens, \"to send it back to the\r\ncommittee without instructions, I would ask him what we are to do.\r\nThere are not quite as many views upon this floor as there are\r\nmembers; but the number lacks very little of it. And how are we to\r\ngather up all those views spread through all this discussion, and\r\naccommodate all, when each view would now probably receive from one to\r\nthree votes in its favor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have only this to say,\" replied Mr. Higby: \"with my views of the\r\nConstitution, I never can vote for this proposition with this proviso\r\nin its present language. I say that it gives a power to the States to\r\nmake governments that are not republican in form.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say to my friend,\" said Mr. Stevens, \"that if I thought, that by\r\nany fair construction of language, such an interpretation could be\r\ngiven as he gives, I would vote against it myself; but I do not\r\nbelieve there is any thing in that objection.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham took the floor in favor of the proposed joint resolution.\r\nIn \"giving this and other amendments to the Constitution my support,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I do not subject myself to the gratuitous imputation of a\r\nwant of reverence either for the Constitution or its illustrious\r\nfounders. I beg leave, at all events, to say, with all possible\r\nrespect for that gentleman, that I do not recognize the right of any\r\nman upon this floor, who was a representative of that party which\r\ndenied the right to defend the Constitution of his country by arms\r\nagainst armed rebellion, to become my accuser.\r\n\r\n\"In seeking to amend, not to mar, the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, we ought to have regard to every express or implied limitation\r\nupon our power imposed by that great instrument. When gentlemen object\r\nto amending the Constitution, when they talk sneeringly about\r\ntinkering with the Constitution, they do not remember that it is one\r\nof the express provisions of that instrument that Congress shall have\r\npower to propose amendments to the Legislatures of the several States.\r\nDo gentlemen mean, by the logic to which we have listened for the past\r\nfive days on this subject of our right to amend, that we are not to\r\nadd any thing to the Constitution, and that we are to take nothing\r\nfrom it? I prefer to follow, in this supreme hour of the nation's\r\ntrial, the lead of a wiser and nobler spirit, who, by common consent,\r\nwas called, while he lived, 'the Father of his Country,' and, now that\r\nhe is dead, is still reverenced as 'the Father of his Country,' and to\r\nbe hailed, I trust, by the millions of the future who are to people\r\nthis land of ours as 'the Father of his Country.' In his Farewell\r\nAddress, his last official utterance, Washington used these\r\nsignificant words, which I repeat to-day for the consideration of\r\ngentlemen: \"The basis of our political systems is the right of the\r\npeople to make and to alter their constitutions of government.' We\r\npropose, sir, simply to act in accordance with this suggestion of\r\nWashington. We propose, in presenting these amendments, to alter, in\r\nso far as the changed condition of the country requires, the\r\nfundamental law, in order to secure the safety of the republic and\r\nfurnish better guarantees in the future for the rights of each and\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"The question that underlies this controversy is this: whether we will\r\nstand by the Constitution in its original intent and spirit, or, like\r\ncravens, abandon it. I assert it here to-day, without fear of\r\ncontradiction, that the amendment pending before this House is an\r\namendment conforming exactly to the spirit of the Constitution, and\r\naccording to the declared intent of its framers.\r\n\r\n\"My friend from California [Mr. Higby] has informed us that there are\r\none hundred thousand more free colored citizens of the United States\r\nin the State of Mississippi to-day than there are of white citizens;\r\nthat there are one hundred thousand more free colored citizens of the\r\nUnited States in South Carolina than there are of white citizens; and\r\nthen we are gravely told that we must not press this amendment,\r\nbecause we are abandoning the Constitution and the intent of our\r\nfathers. That is a new discovery, one for which the Democracy ought to\r\ntake out letters patent, that it was ever intended that a minority of\r\nfree citizens should disfranchise the majority of free male citizens,\r\nof full age, in any State of the Union! For myself, I will never\r\nconsent to it.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to the objection that the proviso in the proposed amendment\r\nseemed to acknowledge the right to deny or abridge the elective\r\nfranchise on account of race or color, Mr. Bingham said: \"I beg the\r\ngentleman to consider that a grant of power by implication can not be\r\nraised by a law which only imposes a penalty, and nothing but a\r\npenalty, for a non-performance of a duty or the violation of a right.\r\nWithin the last hundred years, in no country where the common law\r\nobtains, I venture to say, has any implication of a grant of power\r\never been held to be raised by such a law, and especially an implied\r\npower, to do an act expressly prohibited by the same law. The\r\nguarantee of your Constitution, that the people shall elect their\r\nRepresentatives in the several States, can not be set aside or\r\nimpaired by inserting in your Constitution, as a penalty for\r\ndisregarding it, the provision that the majority of a State that\r\ndenies the equal rights of the minority shall suffer a loss of\r\npolitical power.\r\n\r\n\"I have endeavored to show that the words of the Constitution, the\r\npeople of 'the States shall choose their Representatives,' is an\r\nexpress guarantee that a majority of the free male citizens of the\r\nUnited States in every State of this Union, being of full age, shall\r\nhave the political power subject to the equal right of suffrage in the\r\nminority of free male citizens of full age. There is a further\r\nguarantee in the Constitution of a republican form of government to\r\nevery State, which I take to mean that the majority of the free male\r\ncitizens in every State shall have the political power. I submit to my\r\nfriend that this proviso is nothing but a penalty for a violation on\r\nthe part of the people of any State of the political right or\r\nfranchise guaranteed by the Constitution to their free male\r\nfellow-citizens of full age.\r\n\r\n\"The guarantee in the first article of the second section of the\r\nConstitution, rightly interpreted, is, as I claim, this: that the\r\nmajority of the male citizens of the United States, of full age, in\r\neach State, shall forever exercise the political power of the State\r\nwith this limitation: that they shall never by caste legislation\r\nimpose disabilities upon one class of free male citizens to the denial\r\nor abridgement of equal rights. The further provision is, that the\r\nUnited States shall guarantee to each State a republican form of\r\ngovernment, which means that the majority of male citizens, of full\r\nage, in each State, shall govern, not, however, in violation of the\r\nConstitution of the United States or of the rights of the minority.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing his address, Mr. Bingham said: \"I pray gentlemen to\r\nconsider long before they reject this proviso. It may not be the best\r\nthat the wisest head in this House can conceive of, but I ask\r\ngentlemen to consider that the rule of statesmanship is to take the\r\nbest attainable essential good which is at our command. The reason why\r\nI support the proposed amendment is, that I believe it essential and\r\nattainable. I do not dare to say that it could not be improved. I do\r\ndare to say that it is in aid of the existing grants and guarantees of\r\nthe Constitution of my country, that it is simply a penalty to be\r\ninflicted upon the States for a specific disregard in the future of\r\nthose wise and just and humane grants 'to the people' to elect their\r\nRepresentatives and maintain a republican government in each State.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker, the republic is great; it is great in its domain, equal\r\nin extent to continental Europe, abounding in productions of every\r\nzone, broad enough and fertile enough to furnish bread and homes to\r\nthree hundred million freemen. The republic is great in the\r\nintelligence, thrift, industry, energy, virtue, and valor of its\r\nunconquered and unconquerable children, and great in its matchless,\r\nwise, and beneficent Constitution. I pray the Congress of the United\r\nStates to propose to the people all needful amendments to the\r\nConstitution, that by their sovereign act they may crown the republic\r\nfor all time with the greatness of justice.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Broomall, of Pennsylvania, presented an objection to the\r\nresolution which had not been alluded to by any gentleman on the\r\nfloor. He said: \"The resolution provides that whenever the elective\r\nfranchise shall be denied or abridged in any State, on account of race\r\nor color, all persons of such race or color shall be excluded from the\r\nbasis of representation. Now, there is a great deal of indefiniteness\r\nin both those terms, 'race' and 'color.'\r\n\r\n\"What is a race of men? Writers upon the subject of races differ very\r\nmaterially on this point. Some of them would make four or five races;\r\nothers fifteen; and one, whom I might name, seems inclined not to\r\nlimit the number short of a thousand. I myself am inclined to think\r\nthat the Celtic race is a distinct one from ours. I think that any\r\ngentleman who has studied this subject attentively will at least have\r\ndoubts whether or not the race that appears to have inhabited Europe\r\nin the early historic period, and has been partly dispossessed there\r\nby ours, is not a distinct race from ours.\r\n\r\n\"Again: the word 'color' is exceedingly indefinite. If we had a\r\nconstitutional standard of color, that of sole-leather, for example,\r\nby which to test the State laws upon this subject, there might be less\r\ndanger in incorporating this provision in the Constitution. But the\r\nterm 'color' is nowhere defined in the Constitution or the law. We\r\napply the term to persons who are of African descent, whether their\r\ncolor is whiter or darker than ours. Every one who is familiar with\r\nthe ethnological condition of things here in the United States, and\r\nwho sees the general mixing up of colors, particularly in the\r\nDemocratic portion of the country--I allude to that portion south of\r\nMason and Dixon's line--must say with me that the word 'color' has no\r\nvery distinct meaning when applied to the different peoples of the\r\nUnited States of America.\"\r\n\r\nTwo Representatives from New York--Mr. Davis and Mr. Ward--expressed\r\nopinions favorable to a modification of the basis of representation,\r\nand yet were opposed to the details of the proposition before the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nMr. Nicholson, of Delaware, in emphatic terms, denounced the acts of a\r\nmajority of the House in attempting to amend the Constitution. \"If\r\nthey shall finally triumph,\" said he, \"in the mad schemes in which\r\nthey are engaged, they will succeed in converting that heretofore\r\nsacred instrument, reverenced and obeyed till the present dominant\r\nparty came into power, from a bond of union to a galling yoke of\r\noppression--a thing to be loathed and despised.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion was still much protracted. Many members had an\r\nopportunity of presenting their views and opinions without adding much\r\nto the arguments for or against the measure. The power of debate, as\r\nwell as \"the power of amendment,\" seemed to have exhausted itself, and\r\nyet gentlemen, continued to swell the volume of both through several\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, January 26th, Mr. Harding, of Kentucky, made a violent\r\npolitical speech, ostensibly in opposition to the measure before the\r\nHouse. The following is an extract from his remarks:\r\n\r\n\"The Republican party have manufactured a large amount of capital out\r\nof the negro question. First they began with caution, now they draw on\r\nit as if they thought it as inexhaustible as were the widow's barrel\r\nof meal and cruse of oil. The fact that the negro question has\r\ncontinued so long has been owing to the great care with which the\r\nRepublican party has managed it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKee, of Kentucky, followed. Referring to his colleague who had\r\npreceded him, he said: \"I regret extremely that he has pursued the\r\nsame line of policy that gentlemen belonging to the same political\r\nparty have pursued ever since the idea took possession of the\r\nGovernment that the negro was to be a freeman. His whole speech has\r\nbeen made up of the negro and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\"I would like it if the amendment could go a little beyond what it\r\ndoes. I would like so to amend the Constitution that no man who had\r\nraised his hand against the flag should ever be allowed to participate\r\nin any of the affairs of this Government. But it is not probable that\r\nwe can go that far. Let us go just as far as we can.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen say that they are not willing to vote for an amendment that\r\nstrikes off a part of the representation of the States; they are not\r\nwilling to vote for an amendment that lessens Kentucky's\r\nrepresentation upon this floor. The whole course of my colleague's\r\nremarks on this point is as the course of his party--and I may say of\r\nthe loyal party in Kentucky--has been through a great part of the war,\r\nthat Kentucky is the nation, and the United States a secondary\r\nappendage to her.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kerr, of Indiana, did not desire to be heard at length upon the\r\nmain question before the House, but upon some questions incidentally\r\nconnected with it. He then proceeded to discuss the question whether\r\nCongress has \"the power so to regulate the suffrage as to give the\r\nright of suffrage to every male citizen of the country of twenty-one\r\nyears of age.\" \"I propose now,\" said he, \"for a few moments, to\r\nexamine this question with a somewhat extensive reference to the\r\nhistory of the Constitution in this connection, and if possible to\r\narrive at a conclusion whether the honorable gentleman from\r\nPennsylvania has given greater attention to the history of this\r\nquestion than the President, and whether the conclusion which he has\r\nreached is a safer one for the country, or more in harmony with the\r\nhistory and true intent of the Constitution, than that of the\r\nPresident.\"\r\n\r\nNear the close of his remarks, referring to the measure before the\r\nHouse, Mr. Kerr remarked: \"I can see but one single clear result that\r\nwill follow from this amendment if it is adopted by the people of this\r\ncountry, and that is an effect that will inure not to the advantage of\r\nthe nation, nor of any State in the Union, nor of any class or race of\r\nmen in any State; but it will inure solely to the benefit and\r\nadvantage of the Republican party. In my judgment, the only persons\r\nwho will gain by this provision will be the now dominant party in this\r\ncountry. They will thereby increase their power; they will thereby\r\ndegrade the South; they will reduce her representation here, and\r\nrelatively increase their own representation; they will confirm the\r\nsectional supremacy of the North in the legislation and administration\r\nof the Government. They may thus compel the South to become suppliants\r\nat their feet for justice, and it may be for mercy.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kasson, of Iowa, and Mr. Wright, of New Jersey, made extended\r\nremarks, avowedly in opposition to the measure, but dwelling, for the\r\ngreater portion of their time, upon subjects remotely connected with\r\nthe resolution before the House.\r\n\r\nDiscussion was resumed in the House on Monday, January 29th. The\r\nquestion having become much complicated by the numerous propositions\r\nto amend, the Speaker, by request of Mr. Conkling, stated the exact\r\nposition of the subject before the House, and the various questions\r\npending. The Speaker said: \"The committee having reported this joint\r\nresolution, the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevens] moved to\r\namend by inserting the word 'therein' after the words 'all persons,'\r\nin the last clause of the proposed amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Pending that motion, the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Kelley]\r\nmoved an entirely new proposition in the nature of a substitute for\r\nthe joint resolution reported from the joint committee, proposing an\r\namendment to the Constitution differing from the one reported from the\r\ncommittee. The gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Baker] also submitted for\r\nhis colleague [Mr. Ingersoll] a proposition in the nature of a\r\nsubstitute for the one reported from the committee, as an amendment to\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\n\"Pending those two propositions, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.\r\nLawrence] moved to recommit the joint resolution to the joint\r\ncommittee with certain instructions. The gentleman from Massachusetts\r\n[Mr. Eliot] moved to amend the instructions, and the gentleman from\r\nOhio [Mr. Schenck] moved to amend the amendment.\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Le Blond] also moved to commit the whole\r\nsubject to the Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union. The\r\nfirst question will, therefore, be upon the motion to commit to the\r\nCommittee of the Whole, as that committee is higher in rank than the\r\njoint Committee on Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\"Next after that will be the various motions to recommit with\r\ninstructions. If all those propositions should fail, then the motion\r\nof the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Stevens,] being for the\r\npurpose of perfecting the original proposition, will come up for\r\nconsideration. Then propositions in the nature of substitutes will\r\ncome up for consideration; first the amendment to the amendment,\r\nproposed by the gentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Baker,] and next the\r\nsubstitute amendment of the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Kelley].\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond, of New York, made a speech three hours in length, in\r\nopposition to the proposed amendment to the Constitution. He discussed\r\nthe general questions of reconstruction, affirming that the Southern\r\nStates had resumed their functions of self-government in the Union,\r\nthat they did not change their constitutional relations by making war,\r\nand that Congress should admit their Representatives by districts,\r\nreceiving only loyal men as members.\r\n\r\nThe closing words of Mr. Raymond's speech excited great sensation and\r\nsurprise. They were as follows: \"The gigantic contest is at an end.\r\nThe courage and devotion on either side which made it so terrible and\r\nso long, no longer owe a divided duty, but have become the common\r\nproperty of the American name, the priceless possession of the\r\nAmerican Republic through all time to come. The dead of the contending\r\nhosts sleep beneath the soil of a common country, and under one common\r\nflag. Their hostilities are hushed, and they are the dead of the\r\nnation forever more. The victor may well exult in the victory he has\r\nachieved. Let it be our task, as it will be our highest glory, to make\r\nthe vanquished, and their posterity to the latest generation, rejoice\r\nin their defeat.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Julian could not accept heartily the proposition reported by the\r\njoint committee. He thus presented what he considered a preferable\r\nplan: \"Under the constitutional injunction upon the United States to\r\nguarantee a republican form of government to every State, I believe\r\nthe power already exists in the nation to regulate the right of\r\nsuffrage. It can only exercise this power through Congress; and\r\nCongress, of course, must decide what is a republican form of\r\ngovernment, and when the national authority shall interpose against\r\nState action for the purpose of executing the constitutional\r\nguarantee. No one will deny the authority of Congress to decide that\r\nif a State should disfranchise one-third, one-half, or two-thirds of\r\nher citizens, such State would cease to be republican, and might be\r\nrequired to accept a different rule of suffrage. If Congress could\r\nintervene in such a case, it could obviously intervene in any other\r\ncase in which it might deem it necessary or proper. It certainly might\r\ndecide that the disfranchisement by a State of a whole race of people\r\nwithin her borders is inconsistent with a republican form of\r\ngovernment, and in their behalf, and in the execution of its own\r\nauthority and duty, restore them to their equal right with others to\r\nthe franchise. It might decide, for example, that in North Carolina,\r\nwhere 631,000 citizens disfranchise 331,000, the government is not\r\nrepublican, and should be made so by extending the franchise. It might\r\ndo the same in Virginia, where 719,000 citizens disfranchise 533,000;\r\nin Alabama, where 596,000 citizens disfranchise 437,000; in Georgia,\r\nwhere 591,000 citizens disfranchise 465,000; in Louisiana, where\r\n357,000 citizens disfranchise 350,000; in Mississippi, where 353,000\r\ncitizens disfranchise 436,000; and in South Carolina, where only\r\n291,000 citizens disfranchise 411,000. Can any man who reverences the\r\nConstitution deny either the authority or the duty of Congress to do\r\nall this in the execution of the guarantee named? Or if the 411,000\r\nnegroes in South Carolina were to organize a government, and\r\ndisfranchise her 291,000 white citizens, would any body doubt the\r\nauthority of Congress to pronounce such government anti-republican,\r\nand secure the ballot equally to white and black citizens as the\r\nremedy? Or if a State should prescribe as a qualification for the\r\nballot such an ownership of property, real or personal, as would\r\ndisfranchise the great body of her people, could not Congress most\r\nundoubtedly interfere? So of an educational test, which might fix the\r\nstandard of knowledge so high as to place the governing power in the\r\nhands of a select few. The power in all such cases is a reserved one\r\nin Congress, to be exercised according to its own judgment, with no\r\naccountability to any tribunal save the people; and without such power\r\nthe nation would be at the mercy of as many oligarchies as there are\r\nStates. It is true that the power of Congress to guarantee republican\r\ngovernments in the States through its intervention with the question\r\nof suffrage has not hitherto been exercised, but this certainly does\r\nnot disprove the existence of such power, nor the expediency of its\r\nexercise now, under an additional and independent constitutional\r\ngrant, and when a fit occasion for it has come through the madness of\r\ntreason. Why temporize by adopting half-way measures and a policy of\r\nindirection? The shortest distance between two given points is a\r\nstraight line. Let us follow it in so important a work as amending the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that the broad proposition I advocate will fail in\r\nCongress or before the people? These are revolutionary days. Whole\r\ngenerations of common time are now crowded into the span of a few\r\nyears. Life was never before so grand and blessed an opportunity. The\r\nman mistakes his reckoning who judges either the present or the future\r\nby any political almanac of bygone years. Growth, development,\r\nprogress are the expressive watchwords of the hour. Who can remember\r\nthe marvelous events of the past four years, necessitated by the late\r\nwar, and then predict the failure of further measures, woven into the\r\nsame fabric, and born of the same inevitable logic?\"\r\n\r\nOn Monday, January 30th, the proposed constitutional amendment was\r\nrecommitted to the joint Committee on Reconstruction. On the following\r\nday Mr. Stevens reported back the joint resolution, with an amendment\r\nstriking out the words \"and direct taxes,\" so as to fix simply the\r\nbasis of representation in Congress upon population, excluding those\r\nraces or colors to which the franchise is denied or abridged.\r\n\r\nMr. Schenck offered a substitute making \"male citizens of the United\r\nStates over twenty-one years\" the basis of representation. Mr. Schenck\r\noccupied a few minutes in advocating his proposition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Mr. Benjamin, of Missouri, objected to the\r\nsubstitute as greatly to the detriment of Missouri, since it would\r\nreduce her representation in Congress from nine to four, because she\r\nhas endeavored to place the Government in loyal hands by\r\ndisfranchising the rebel element of that State. In doing this, she had\r\ndisfranchised one-half her voters.\r\n\r\nThe previous question having been called, Mr. Stevens made the closing\r\nspeech of the protracted discussion. In the opening of his speech, Mr.\r\nStevens said: \"It is true we have been informed by high authority, at\r\nthe other end of the avenue, introduced through an unusual conduit,\r\nthat no amendment is necessary to the Constitution as our fathers made\r\nit, and that it is better to let it stand as it is. Now, sir, I think\r\nvery differently, myself, for one individual. I believe there is\r\nintrusted to this Congress a high duty, no less important and no less\r\nfraught with the weal or woe of future ages than was intrusted to the\r\naugust body that made the Declaration of Independence. I believe now,\r\nif we omit to exercise that high duty, or abuse it, we shall be held\r\nto account by future generations of America, and by the whole\r\ncivilized world that is in favor of freedom, and that our names will\r\ngo down to posterity with some applause or with black condemnation if\r\nwe do not treat the subject thoroughly, honestly, and justly in\r\nreference to every human being on this continent.\"\r\n\r\nThat the above paragraph may be understood, it will be necessary to\r\nstate that the President of the United States himself had taken part\r\nin the discussion of the measure pending before Congress. The \"unusual\r\nconduit\" was the telegraph and the press--the means by which his\r\nopinions were given to Congress and the public. The President's\r\nopinions were expressed in the following paper, as read by the Clerk\r\nof the House, at the request of several members:\r\n\r\n     \"The following is the substance of a conversation which took\r\n     place yesterday between the President and a distinguished\r\n     Senator, as telegraphed North by the agent of the Associated\r\n     Press:\r\n\r\n     \"The President said that he doubted the propriety at this\r\n     time of making further amendments to the Constitution. One\r\n     great amendment had already been made, by which slavery had\r\n     forever been abolished within the limits of the United\r\n     States, and a national guarantee thus given that the\r\n     institution should never exist in the land. Propositions to\r\n     amend the Constitution were becoming as numerous as\r\n     preambles and resolutions at town meetings called to\r\n     consider the most ordinary questions connected with the\r\n     administration of local affairs. All this, in his opinion,\r\n     had a tendency to diminish the dignity and prestige attached\r\n     to the Constitution of the country, and to lessen the\r\n     respect and confidence of the people in their great charter\r\n     of freedom. If, however, amendments are to be made to the\r\n     Constitution, changing the basis of representation and\r\n     taxation, (and he did not deem them at all necessary at the\r\n     present time,) he knew of none better than a simple\r\n     proposition, embraced in a few lines, making in each State\r\n     the number of qualified voters the basis of representation,\r\n     and the value of property the basis of direct taxation. Such\r\n     a proposition could be embraced in the following terms:\r\n\r\n     \"'Representatives shall be apportioned among the several\r\n     States which may be included within this Union according to\r\n     the number of qualified voters in each State.\r\n\r\n     \"'Direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States\r\n     which may be included within this Union according to the\r\n     value of all taxable property in each State.'\r\n\r\n     \"An amendment of this kind would, in his opinion, place the\r\n     basis of representation and direct taxation upon correct\r\n     principles. The qualified voters were, for the most part,\r\n     men who were subject to draft and enlistment when it was\r\n     necessary to repel invasion, suppress rebellion, and quell\r\n     domestic violence and insurrection. They risk their lives,\r\n     shed their blood, and peril their all to uphold the\r\n     Government, and give protection, security, and value to\r\n     property. It seemed but just that property should compensate\r\n     for the benefits thus conferred by defraying the expenses\r\n     incident to its protection and enjoyment.\r\n\r\n     \"Such an amendment, the President also suggested, would\r\n     remove from Congress all issues in reference to the\r\n     political equality of the races. It would leave the States\r\n     to determine absolutely the qualifications of their own\r\n     voters with regard to color; and thus the number of\r\n     Representatives to which they would be entitled in Congress\r\n     would depend upon the number upon whom they conferred the\r\n     right of suffrage.\r\n\r\n     \"The President, in this connection, expressed the opinion\r\n     that the agitation of the negro-franchise question in the\r\n     District of Columbia, at this time was the mere\r\n     entering-wedge to the agitation of the question throughout\r\n     the States, and was ill-timed, uncalled for, and calculated\r\n     to do great harm. He believed that it would engender enmity,\r\n     contention, and strife between the two races, and lead to a\r\n     war between»them which would result in great injury to both,\r\n     and the certain extermination of the negro population.\r\n     Precedence, he thought, should be given to more important\r\n     and urgent matters, legislation upon which was essential for\r\n     the restoration of the Union, the peace of the country, and\r\n     the prosperity of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Mr. Stevens, \"I take to be an authorized utterance of one\r\nat the other end of the avenue. I have no doubt that this is the\r\nproclamation, the command of the President of the United States, made\r\nand put forth by authority in advance, and at a time when this\r\nCongress was legislating on this very question; made, in my judgment,\r\nin violation of the privileges of this House; made in such a way that\r\ncenturies ago, had it been made to Parliament by a British king, it\r\nwould have cost him his head. But, sir, we pass that by; we are\r\ntolerant of usurpation in this tolerant Government of ours.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to those who contended that Congress should regulate the\r\nright of suffrage in the States, Mr. Stevens said: \"If you should take\r\naway the right which now is and always has been exercised by the\r\nStates, by fixing the qualifications of their electors, instead of\r\ngetting nineteen States, which is necessary to ratify this amendment,\r\nyou might possibly get five. I venture to say you could not get five\r\nin this Union. And that is an answer, in the opinion of the committee,\r\nto all that has been said on this subject. But it grants no right. It\r\nsays, however, to the State of South Carolina and other slave States,\r\nTrue, we leave where it has been left for eighty years the right to\r\nfix the elective franchise, but you must not abuse it; if you do, the\r\nConstitution will impose upon you a penalty, and will continue to\r\ninflict it until you shall have corrected your actions.\r\n\r\n\"Now, any man who knows any thing about the condition of aspiration\r\nand ambition for power which exists in the slave States, knows that\r\none of their chief objects is to rule this country. It was to ruin it\r\nif they could not rule it. They have not been able to ruin it, and now\r\ntheir great ambition will be to rule it. If a State abuses the\r\nelective franchise, and takes it from those who are the only loyal\r\npeople there, the Constitution says to such a State, You shall lose\r\npower in the halls of the nation, and you shall remain where you are,\r\na shriveled and dried-up nonentity instead of being the lords of\r\ncreation, as you have been, so far as America is concerned, for years\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, I say no more strong inducement could ever beheld out to\r\nthem; no more severe punishment could ever be inflicted upon them as\r\nStates. If they exclude the colored population, they will lose at\r\nleast thirty-five Representatives in this hall; if they adopt it, they\r\nwill have eighty-three votes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens urged several objections to the proposition of Mr.\r\nSchenck. He said: \"If I have been rightly informed as to the number,\r\nthere are from fifteen to twenty Representatives in the Northern\r\nStates founded upon those who are not citizens of the United States.\r\nIn New York I think there are three or four Representatives founded\r\nupon the foreign population--three certainly. And so it is in\r\nWisconsin, Iowa, and other Northern States. There are fifteen or\r\ntwenty Northern Representatives that would be lost by that amendment\r\nand given to the South whenever they grant the elective franchise to\r\nthe negro.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, while I have not any particular regard for any foreigner\r\nwho goes against me, yet I do not think it would be wise to put into\r\nthe Constitution or send to the people a proposition to amend the\r\nConstitution which would take such Representatives from those States,\r\nand which, therefore, they will never adopt.\r\n\r\n\"But I have another objection to the amendment of my friend from Ohio.\r\nHis proposition is to apportion representation according to the male\r\ncitizens of the States. Why has he put in the word 'male?' It was\r\nnever in the Constitution of the United States before. Why make a\r\ncrusade against women in the Constitution of the nation? [Laughter.]\r\nIs my friend as much afraid of their rivalry as the gentlemen on the\r\nother side of the House are afraid of the rivalry of the negro?\r\n[Laughter.] I do not think we ought to disfigure the Constitution with\r\nsuch a provision. I find that every unmarried man is opposed to the\r\nproposition. Whether married men have particular reason for dreading\r\ninterference from that quarter I know not. [Laughter.] I certainly\r\nshall never vote to insert the word 'male' or the word 'white' in the\r\nnational Constitution. Let these things be attended to by the\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to the objection that the amendment proposed by the\r\ncommittee \"might be evaded by saying that no man who had ever been a\r\nslave should vote, and that would not be disfranchisement on account\r\nof race or color,\" Mr. Stevens said: \"Sir, no man in America ever was\r\nor ever could be a slave if he was a white man. I know white men have\r\nbeen held in bondage contrary to law. But there never was a court in\r\nthe United States, in a slave State or a free State, that has not\r\nadmitted that if one held as a slave could prove himself to be white,\r\nhe was that instant free. And, therefore, such an exclusion, on\r\naccount of previous condition of slavery, must be an exclusion on\r\naccount of race or color. Therefore that objection falls to the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to the closing paragraph of Mr. Raymond's speech, Mr. Stevens\r\nsaid: \"I could not but admire (an admiration mingled with wonder) the\r\namiability of temper, the tenderness of heart, the generosity of\r\nfeeling which must have prompted some of the closing sentences of the\r\nexcellent and able speech delivered by the gentleman on last Monday.\r\nHis words were these:\r\n\r\n     \"'The gigantic contest is at an end. The courage and\r\n     devotion on either side, which made it so terrible and so\r\n     long, no longer owe a divided duty, but have become the\r\n     common property of the American name, the priceless\r\n     possession of the American Republic, through all time to\r\n     come. The dead of the contending hosts sleep beneath the\r\n     soil of a common country, under their common flag. Their\r\n     hostilities are hushed, and they are the dead of the nation\r\n     for evermore.'\r\n\r\n\"Sir, much more than amiable, much more than religious, must be the\r\nsentiment that would prompt any man to say that 'the courage and\r\ndevotion' which so long withstood our arms, prolonging the terrible\r\nconflict of war, and sacrificing the lives of thousands of loyal men,\r\nare hereafter to be the common boast of the nation, 'the priceless\r\npossession of the American Republic through all time to come;' that it\r\nis the pride of our country so many infamous rebels were so ferocious\r\nin their murders.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we are to consider these dead on both sides as the dead of the\r\nnation, the common dead! And so, I suppose, we are to raise monuments\r\nbeside the monuments to Reynolds and others, to be erected in the\r\ncemetery on the battle-field of Gettysburg. We must there build high\r\nthe monumental marble for men like Barksdale, whom I have seen in this\r\nhall draw their bowie-knives on the Representatives of the people; men\r\nwho died upon the battle-field of Gettysburg in arms against the\r\nGovernment, and where they now lie buried in ditches, 'unwept,\r\nunhonored, and unsung!' They are, I suppose, to be raised and put into\r\nthe fore-front ranks of the nation, and we are to call them through\r\nall time as the dead of the nation! Sir, was there ever blasphemy\r\nbefore like this? Who was it burnt the temple of Ephesus? Who was it\r\nimitated the thunder of Jove? All that was poor compared with this\r\nblasphemy. I say, if the loyal dead, who are thus associated with the\r\ntraitors who murdered them, put by the gentleman on the same footing\r\nwith them, are to be treated as the 'common dead of the nation'--I\r\nsay, sir, if they could have heard the gentleman, they would have\r\nbroken the cerements of the tomb, and stalked forth and haunted him\r\nuntil his eye-balls were seared.\"\r\n\r\nThe question was first taken on the substitute offered by Mr. Schenck,\r\nwhich was rejected by a vote of one hundred and thirty-one to\r\ntwenty-nine.\r\n\r\nThe question was then taken on agreeing to the joint resolution as\r\nmodified by the committee, and it was decided in the affirmative by\r\nthe following vote:\r\n\r\n     YEAS--Messrs.

Many gentlemen\r\nevidently surrendered their individual preferences for the sake of\r\nunanimity. They believed that this was the best measure calculated to\r\nsecure just representation, which would pass the ordeal of Congress\r\nand three-fourths of the States. They accepted the \"rule of\r\nstatesmanship,\" to \"take the best attainable, essential good which is\r\nat our command.\"\r\n\r\nA disposition to rebuke supposed Executive dictation had some effect\r\nto produce an unexpected unanimity in favor of the measure. One Rhode\r\nIsland and two Massachusetts members insisted on national negro\r\nsuffrage, and voted against the amendments. Mr. Raymond and Mr. Hale,\r\nof New York, were the only Republicans who voted against the measure\r\nin accordance with the President's opinions. Of the border slave State\r\nmembers, ten voted for the amendment and sixteen against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE BASIS OF-REPRESENTATION--IN THE SENATE.\r\n\r\n     The Joint Resolution goes to the Senate --\r\n     Counter-proposition by Mr. Sumner -- He Speaks Five Hours --\r\n     Mr. Henderson's Amendment -- Mr. Fessenden -- Mr. Henry S.\r\n     Lane -- Mr. Johnson -- Mr. Henderson -- Mr. Clark's\r\n     Historical Statements -- Fred. Douglass' Memorial -- Mr.\r\n     Williams -- Mr. Hendricks -- Mr. Chandler's \"Blood-letting\r\n     Letter\" -- Proposition of Mr. Yates -- His Speech -- Mr.\r\n     Buckalew against New England -- Mr. Pomeroy -- Mr. Sumner's\r\n     Second Speech -- Mr. Doolittle -- Mr. Morrill -- Mr.\r\n     Fessenden meets Objections -- Final Vote -- The Amendment\r\n     Defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution, providing for amending the basis of\r\nrepresentation, having passed the House of Representatives on the last\r\nday of January, 1866, the action of that body was communicated to the\r\nSenate. The Civil Rights Bill at that time occupying the attention of\r\nthe Senate, Mr. Fessenden gave notice that unless something should\r\noccur to render that course unwise, he would ask that the\r\nconsideration of the proposed constitutional amendment should be taken\r\nup on the following Monday, February 5th.\r\n\r\nOn the second of February, Mr. Sumner gave notice of his intention to\r\nmove a joint resolution as a counter-proposition to the proposed\r\nconstitutional amendment. Mr. Sumner's resolution was as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, it is provided in the Constitution that the\r\n     United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a\r\n     republican form of government; and whereas, by reason of the\r\n     failure of certain States to maintain Governments which\r\n     Congress can recognize, it has become the duty of the United\r\n     States, standing in the place of guarantor, where the\r\n     principal has made a lapse, to secure to such States,\r\n     according to the requirement of the guarantee, governments\r\n     republican in form; and whereas, further, it is provided in\r\n     a recent constitutional amendment, that Congress may\r\n     'enforce' the prohibition of slavery by 'appropriate\r\n     legislation,' and it is important to this end that all\r\n     relics of slavery should be removed, including all\r\n     distinction of rights on account of color; now, therefore,\r\n     to carry out the guarantee of a republican form of\r\n     government, and to enforce the prohibition of slavery.\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives\r\n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled_, That\r\n     in all States lately declared to be in rebellion there shall\r\n     be no oligarchy, aristocracy, caste, or monopoly invested\r\n     with peculiar privileges or powers, and there shall be no\r\n     denial of rights, civil or political, on account of color or\r\n     race; but all persons shall be equal before the law, whether\r\n     in the court-room or at the ballot-box; and this statute,\r\n     made in pursuance of the Constitution, shall be the supreme\r\n     law of the land, any thing in the constitution or laws of\r\n     any such State to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to notice given by the Chairman of the joint Committee on\r\nReconstruction on the part of the Senate, the proposed constitutional\r\namendment came up for consideration on the fifth of February.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner addressed the Senate in opposition to the measure. His\r\nspeech was five hours in length, and occupied parts of the sessions of\r\ntwo days in its delivery. Mr. Sumner argued that the proposed\r\namendment would introduce \"discord and defilement into the\r\nConstitution,\" by admitting that rights could be \"denied or abridged\r\non account of race or color,\" and that by its adoption Congress would\r\nprove derelict to its constitutional duty to guarantee a republican\r\nform of government to each State, and that having already legislated\r\nto protect the colored race in civil rights, it is bound to secure to\r\nthem political rights also.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Committee on Reconstruction and their proposition, Mr.\r\nSumner said: \"Knowing, as I do, the eminent character of the\r\ncommittee, its intelligence, its patriotism, and the moral instincts\r\nby which it is moved, I am at a loss to understand the origin of a\r\nproposition which seems to me nothing else than another compromise of\r\nhuman rights, as if the country had not already paid enough in costly\r\ntreasure and more costly blood for such compromises in the past. I had\r\nhoped that the day of compromise with wrong had passed forever. Ample\r\nexperience shows that it is the least practical mode of settling\r\nquestions involving moral principles. A moral principle can not be\r\ncompromised.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought the proposed change in the Constitution could not properly\r\nbe called an amendment. \"For some time we have been carefully\r\nexpunging from the statute-book the word 'white,' and now it is\r\nproposed to insert in the Constitution itself a distinction of color.\r\nAn amendment, according to the dictionaries, is 'an improvement'--'a\r\nchange for the better.' Surely the present proposition is an amendment\r\nwhich, like the crab, goes backward.\"\r\n\r\nThis measure would not accomplish the results desired by its authors.\r\n\"If by this,\" said he, \"you expect to induce the recent slave-master\r\nto confer the right of suffrage without distinction of color, you will\r\nfind the proposition a delusion and a snare. He will do no such thing.\r\nEven the bribe you offer will not tempt him. If, on the other hand,\r\nyou expect to accomplish a reduction of his political power, it is\r\nmore than doubtful if you will succeed, while the means you employ are\r\nunworthy of our country. There are tricks and evasions possible, and\r\nthe cunning slave-master will drive his coach and six through your\r\namendment, stuffed with all his Representatives.\"\r\n\r\nDrawing toward the close of his speech, Mr. Sumner gave the following\r\nreview of his remarks that had preceded: \"We have seen the origin of\r\nthe controversy which led to the revolution, when Otis, with such wise\r\nhardihood, insisted upon equal rights, and then giving practical\r\neffect to the lofty demand, sounded the battle-cry that 'Taxation\r\nwithout Representation is Tyranny.' We have followed this controversy\r\nin its anxious stages, where these principles were constantly asserted\r\nand constantly denied, until it broke forth in battle; we have seen\r\nthese principles adopted as the very frontlet of the republic, when it\r\nassumed its place in the family of nations, and then again when it\r\nordained its Constitution; we have seen them avowed and illustrated in\r\nmemorable words by the greatest authorities of the time; lastly, we\r\nhave seen them embodied in public acts of the States collectively and\r\nindividually; and now, out of this concurring, cumulative, and\r\nunimpeachable testimony, constituting a speaking aggregation\r\nabsolutely without precedent, I offer you the American definition of a\r\nrepublican form of government. It is in vain that you cite\r\nphilosophers or publicists, or the examples of former history. Against\r\nthese I put the early and constant postulates of the fathers, the\r\ncorporate declarations of the fathers, the avowed opinions of the\r\nfathers, and the public acts of the fathers, all with one voice\r\nproclaiming, first, that all men are equal in rights, and, secondly,\r\nthat governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned; and here is the American idea of a republic, which must be\r\nadopted in the interpretation of the National Constitution. You can\r\nnot reject it. As well reject the Decalogue in determining moral\r\nduties, or as well reject the multiplication table in determining a\r\nquestion of arithmetic.\"\r\n\r\nMaintaining that \"the rebel States are not republican governments,\"\r\nMr. Sumner said: \"Begin with Tennessee, which disfranchises 283,079\r\ncitizens, being more than a quarter of its whole 'people.' Thus\r\nviolating a distinctive principle of republican government, how can\r\nthis State be recognized as republican? This question is easier asked\r\nthan answered. But Tennessee is the least offensive on the list. There\r\nis Virginia, which disfranchises 549,019 citizens, being more than a\r\nthird of its whole 'people.' There is Alabama, which disfranchises\r\n436,030 citizens, being nearly one half of its whole 'people.' There\r\nis Louisiana, which disfranchises 350,546 citizens, being one half of\r\nits whole 'people.' There is Mississippi, which disfranchises 437,404\r\ncitizens, being much more than one half of its whole 'people.' And\r\nthere is South Carolina, which disfranchises 412,408 citizens, being\r\nnearly two-thirds of its whole 'people.' A republic is a pyramid\r\nstanding on the broad mass of the people as a base; but here is a\r\npyramid balanced on its point. To call such a government 'republican'\r\nis a mockery of sense and decency. A monarch, 'surrounded by\r\nrepublican institutions,' which at one time was the boast of France,\r\nwould be less offensive to correct principles, and give more security\r\nto human rights.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Southern system of government he said: \"It is essentially a\r\nmonopoly, in a country which sets its face against all monopolies as\r\nunequal and immoral. If any monopoly deserves unhesitating judgment,\r\nit must be that which absorbs the rights of others and engrosses\r\npolitical power. How vain it is to condemn the petty monopolies of\r\ncommerce, and then allow this vast, all-embracing monopoly of human\r\nrights.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner maintained that the ballot was the great guarantee--\"the\r\nonly sufficient guarantee--being in itself peacemaker, reconciler,\r\nschoolmaster, and protector.\" The result of conferring suffrage upon\r\nthe negro will be, \"The master will recognize the new citizen. The\r\nslave will stand with tranquil self-respect in the presence of the\r\nmaster. Brute force disappears. Distrust is at an end. The master is\r\nno longer a tyrant. The freedman is no longer a dependent. The ballot\r\ncomes to him in his depression, and says, 'Use me and be elevated.' It\r\ncomes to him in his passion, and says, 'Use me and do not fight.' It\r\ncomes to him in his daily thoughts, filling him with the strength and\r\nglory of manhood.\"\r\n\r\nMost beneficent results, it was thought, would flow from such\r\nlegislation as that advocated by Mr. Sumner. \"I see clearly,\" said he,\r\n\"that there is nothing in the compass of mortal power so important to\r\nthem in every respect, morally, politically, and economically--that\r\nthere is nothing with such certain promise to them of beneficent\r\nresults--that there is nothing so sure to make their land smile with\r\nindustry and fertility as the decree of equal rights which I now\r\ninvoke. Let the decree go forth to cover them with blessings, sure to\r\ndescend upon their children in successive generations. They have given\r\nus war; we give them peace. They have raged against us in the name of\r\nslavery; we send them back the benediction of justice for all. They\r\nmenace hate; we offer in return all the sacred charities of country\r\ntogether with oblivion of the past. This is our 'Measure for Measure.'\r\nThis is our retaliation. This is our only revenge.\"\r\n\r\nThe following was the closing paragraph of Mr. Sumner's speech: \"The\r\nRoman Cato, after declaring his belief in the immortality of the soul,\r\nadded, that if this were an error, it was an error which he loved. And\r\nnow, declaring my belief in liberty and equality as the God-given\r\nbirthright of all men, let me say, in the same spirit, if this be an\r\nerror, it is an error which I love; if this be a fault, it is a fault\r\nwhich I shall be slow to renounce; if this be an illusion, it is an\r\nillusion which I pray may wrap the world in its angelic arms.\"\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of February, the subject being again before the Senate,\r\nMr. Henderson, of Missouri, moved to strike out the constitutional\r\namendment proposed by the committee and insert the following:\r\n\r\n     \"ARTICLE 14. No State, in prescribing the qualifications\r\n     requisite for electors therein, shall discriminate against\r\n     any person on account of color or race.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden made a speech in favor of the report of the committee,\r\nand in reply to Mr. Sumner. Referring to the subject of constitutional\r\namendments, Mr. Fessenden said: \"Something has been said, also, on\r\ndifferent occasions, with reference to a disposition that is said to\r\nprevail now to amend the Constitution, and the forbearance of Congress\r\nhas been invoked with regard to that venerable and great instrument. I\r\nbelieve that I have as much veneration for the Constitution as most\r\nmen, and I believe that I have as high an opinion of its wisdom; but,\r\nsir, I probably have no better opinion of it than those who made it,\r\nand it did not seem to them, as we learn from its very provisions,\r\nthat it was so perfect that no amendment whatever could be made that\r\nwould be, in the language of the Senator from Massachusetts, an\r\nimprovement. Why, sir, they provided themselves, as we all know, in\r\nthe original instrument, for its amendment. They, in the very earliest\r\ndays of our history, amended it themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of retaining the \"Constitution as it is\" would be this:\r\n\"The continuance of precisely the same rule, and the fostering of a\r\nfeeling which the honorable Senator from Massachusetts has well proven\r\nto be contrary to the very foundation principles of a republican\r\ngovernment. There can be no question that such would be the result;\r\nand we should have in a portion of the States all the people\r\nrepresented and all the people acting, and in another portion of the\r\nStates all the people represented and but a portion of the people only\r\nexercising political rights and retaining them in their own hands.\r\nSuch has been the case, and such, judging of human nature as it is, we\r\nhave a right to suppose will continue to be the case.\"\r\n\r\nThe measure proposed by the committee was not entirely satisfactory to\r\nMr. Fessenden. \"I am free to confess,\" said he, \"that could I\r\nlegislate upon that subject, although I can see difficulties that\r\nwould arise from it, yet trusting to time to soften them, and being\r\ndesirous, if I can, to put into the Constitution a principle that\r\ncommends itself to the consideration of every enlightened mind at\r\nonce, I would prefer something of that sort, a distinct proposition\r\nthat all provisions in the constitution or laws of any State making\r\nany distinction in civil or political rights, or privileges, or\r\nimmunities whatever, should be held unconstitutional, inoperative, and\r\nvoid, or words to that effect. I would like that much better; and I\r\ntake it there are not many Senators within the sound of my voice who\r\nwould not very much prefer it; but, after all, the committee did not\r\nrecommend a provision of that description, and I stand here as the\r\norgan of the committee, approving what they have done, and not\r\ndisposed to urge my own peculiar views, if I have any, against theirs,\r\nor to rely exclusively on my own judgment so far as to denounce what\r\nhonorable and true men, of better judgments than myself, have thought\r\nbest to recommend, and in which I unite and agree with them.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having given objections to limiting the basis of representation\r\nto voters, Mr. Fessenden remarked: \"And if you extend it to citizens,\r\nor narrow it to citizens, you make it worse so far as many of the\r\nStates are concerned; for my honorable friends from the Pacific coast,\r\nwhere there is a large number of foreigners, would hardly be willing\r\nto have them cut off; and they have no benefit of political power in\r\nthe legislation of the country arising from the number of those\r\nforeigners who make a portion of their population. The difficulty is,\r\nthat you meet with troubles of this kind every-where the moment you\r\ndepart from the principle of basing representation upon population and\r\npopulation alone. You meet with inequalities, with difficulties, with\r\ntroubles, either in one section of the country or the other, and you\r\nare inevitably thrown back upon the original principle of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\"It will be noticed that the amendment which we have thus presented\r\nhas one good quality: it preserves the original basis of\r\nrepresentation; it leaves that matter precisely where the Constitution\r\nplaced it in the first instance; it makes no changes in that respect;\r\nit violates no prejudice; it violates no feeling. Every State is\r\nrepresented according to its population with this distinction: that if\r\na State says that it has a portion, a class, which is not fit to be\r\nrepresented--and it is for the State to decide--it shall not be\r\nrepresented; that is all. It has another good point: it is equal in\r\nits operation; all persons in every State are to be counted; nobody is\r\nto be rejected. With the very trifling exception fixed by the original\r\nConstitution, all races, colors, nations, languages, and denominations\r\nform the basis.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, the great excellence of it--and I think it is an\r\nexcellence--is, that it accomplishes indirectly what we may not have\r\nthe power to accomplish directly. If we can not put into the\r\nConstitution, owing to existing prejudices and existing institutions,\r\nan entire exclusion of all class distinctions, the next question is,\r\ncan we accomplish that work in any other way?\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the \"counter-proposition\" of Mr. Sumner, the speaker said:\r\n\"It is, in one sense, like a very small dipper with a very long\r\nhandle; for the preamble is very much more diffuse than the proposed\r\nenactment itself. I looked to see what came next. I supposed that\r\nafter that preamble we should have some adequate machinery provided\r\nfor the enforcement and security of these rights; that we should have\r\nthe matter put to the courts, and if the courts could not accomplish\r\nit, that we should have the aid of the military power, thus shocking\r\nthe sensibilities of my honorable friend from Indiana [Mr. Hendricks]\r\nagain. I do not know what good it does to merely provide by law that\r\nthe provisions of the Constitution shall be enforced, without saying\r\nhow, in what manner, by what machinery, in what way, to what extent,\r\nor how it is to be accomplished. Why reënact the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and put it in a bill? What do you accomplish by it? How\r\nis that a remedy? It is simply as if it read in this way: Whereas, it\r\nis provided in the Constitution that the United States shall guarantee\r\nto every State in the Union a republican form of government, therefore\r\nwe declare that there shall be a republican form of government and\r\nnothing else.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner had said, in his speech in opposition to the proposed\r\namendment, \"Above all, do not copy the example of Pontius Pilate, who\r\nsurrendered the Savior of the world, in whom he found no fault at all,\r\nto be scourged and crucified, while he set at large Barabbas, of whom\r\nthe Gospel says, in simple words, 'Now, Barabbas was a robber.'\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Fessenden responded: \"Is it a 'mean compromise'--for so it\r\nis denominated--that the Committee of Fifteen and the House of\r\nRepresentatives, when they passed it, placed themselves in the\r\nsituation of Pontius Pilate, with the negro for the Savior of the\r\nworld and the people of the United States for Barabbas, as designated\r\nby the honorable Senator. Why, sir, I expected to hear him in the next\r\nbreath go further than that, and say that with the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and the constitutions of the States the negro had been\r\ncrucified, and that now, by the amendment of the Constitution, the\r\nstone had been rolled away from the door of the sepulcher, and he had\r\nascended to sit on the throne of the Almighty and judge the world! One\r\nwould have been, permit me to say with all respect, in as good taste\r\nas the other.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Mr. Fessenden said: \"I wish to say, in closing, that I\r\ncommend this joint resolution to the careful consideration of the\r\nSenate. It is all that we could desire; it is all that our\r\nconstituents could wish. It does not accomplish, as it stands now,\r\nall, perhaps, that it might accomplish; but it is an important step in\r\nthe right direction. It gives the sanction of Congress, in so many\r\nwords, to an important, leading, effective idea. It opens a way by\r\nwhich the Southern mind--to speak of it as the Southern mind--may be\r\nled to that which is right and just. I have hopes, great hopes, of\r\nthose who were recently Confederates; and I believe that now that they\r\nhave been taught that they can not do evil, to all the extent that\r\nthey might desire, with impunity, and when their attention is turned\r\nof necessity in the right direction, the road will seem so pleasant to\r\ntheir feet, or, at any rate, will seem so agreeable to their love of\r\npower, that they will be willing to walk in the direction that we have\r\npointed. If they do, what is accomplished? In process of time, under\r\nthis constitutional amendment, if it should be adopted, they are led\r\nto enlarge their franchise. That necessarily will lead them to\r\nconsider how much further they can go, what is necessary in order to\r\nfit their people for its exercise, thus leading to education, thus\r\nleading to a greater degree of civilization, thus bringing up an\r\noppressed and downtrodden race to an equality, if capable of an\r\nequality--and I hope it may be--with their white brethren, children of\r\nthe same Father.\r\n\r\n\"And, sir, if this is done, some of us may hope to live--I probably\r\nmay not, but the honorable Senator from Massachusetts may--to see the\r\ntime when, by their own act, and under the effect of an enlightened\r\nstudy of their own interests, all men may be placed upon the same\r\nbroad constitutional level, enjoying the same rights, and seeking\r\nhappiness in the same way and under the same advantages; and that is\r\nall that we could ask.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the discussion was continued by Mr. Lane, of\r\nIndiana, who addressed the Senate in a speech of two hours' duration.\r\nMr. Lane seldom occupied the time of the Senate by speech-making, but\r\nwhen he felt it his duty to speak, none upon the floor attracted more\r\nmarked attention, both from the importance of his matter and the\r\nimpressiveness of his manner.\r\n\r\nMuch of Mr. Lane's speech, on this occasion, was devoted to the\r\ngeneral subject of reconstruction, since he regarded the pending\r\nmeasure as one of a series looking to the ultimate restoration of the\r\nlate rebel States. He was opposed to undue haste in this important\r\nwork. He said: \"The danger is of precipitate action. Delay is now what\r\nwe need. The infant in its tiny fingers plays to-day with a handful of\r\nacorns, but two hundred years hence, by the efflux of time, those\r\nacorns are the mighty material out of which navies are built, the\r\nmonarch of the forest, defying the shock of the storm and the\r\nwhirlwind. Time is a mighty agent in all these affairs, and we should\r\nappeal to time. We are not ready yet for a restoration upon rebel\r\nvotes; we are not ready yet for a restoration upon colored votes; but,\r\nthank God! we are willing and able to wait. We have the Government, we\r\nhave the Constitution of the United States, we have the army and the\r\nnavy, the vast moral and material power of the republic. We can\r\nenforce the laws in all the rebel States, and we can keep the peace\r\nuntil such time as they may be restored with safety to them and safety\r\nto us.\"\r\n\r\nOf the measure proposed by the committee, Mr. Lane remarked: \"This\r\namendment, as I have already endeavored to show, will do away with\r\nmuch of the irregularity now existing, and which would exist under a\r\ndifferent state of things, the blacks being all free. So far as the\r\namendment goes, I approve of it, and I think I shall vote for it, but\r\nwith a distinct understanding that it is not all that we are required\r\nto do, that it is not the only amendment to the Constitution that\r\nCongress is required to make.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lane expressed his opinion of Mr. Summer's \"counter-proposition\"\r\nin the following language: \"It is a noble declaration, but a simple\r\ndeclaration, a paper bullet that kills no one, and fixes and maintains\r\nthe rights of no one.\"\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Henderson's proposition, he said: \"It is a simple amendment to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, that no one shall be excluded\r\nfrom the exercise of the right of suffrage on account of race or\r\ncolor. That begins at the right point. The only objection to it is,\r\nthat its operation can not be immediate, and in the mean time the\r\nrebels may be permitted to vote, and its adoption by the various State\r\nLegislatures is exceedingly doubtful. I should not doubt, however,\r\nthat we might secure its adoption by three-fourths of the loyal States\r\nwho have never seceded; and I believe that whenever that question is\r\npresented, the Supreme Court of the United States will determine that\r\na ratification by that number of States is a constitutional approval\r\nof an amendment so as to make it the supreme law of the land. I have\r\nno doubt about it.\r\n\r\n\"If the rebel States are to be organized immediately, the only\r\nquestion is whether the right of suffrage shall be given to rebel\r\nwhite men or loyal black men. The amendment of the Senator from\r\nMissouri meets that issue squarely in the face. Whatsoever I desire to\r\ndo I will not do by indirection. I trust I shall always be brave\r\nenough to do whatsoever I think my duty requires, directly and not by\r\nindirection.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lane, with several other Western Senators, had been counted as\r\nopposed to negro suffrage, hence his advocacy of the principle gave\r\nmuch strength to those who desired to take a position in advance of\r\nthe proposition of the committee.\r\n\r\nIn reply to an oft-reiterated argument that a war of races would\r\nresult from allowing suffrage to the negro, Mr. Lane remarked: \"If you\r\nwish to avoid a war of races, how can that be accomplished? By doing\r\nright; by fixing your plan of reconstruction upon the indestructible\r\nbasis of truth and justice. What lesson is taught by history? The\r\ngrand lesson is taught there that rebellions and insurrections have\r\ngrown out of real or supposed wrong and oppression. A war of races!\r\nAnd you are told to look to the history of Ireland, and to the history\r\nof Hungary. Why is it that revolution and insurrection are always\r\nready to break out in Hungary? Because, forsooth, the iron rule of\r\nAustria has stricken down the natural rights of the masses. It is a\r\nprotest of humanity against tyranny, oppression, that produces\r\nrebellion and revolution. So in the bloody history of the Irish\r\ninsurrections. Suppose the English Parliament had given equal rights\r\nto the Irish, had enfranchised the Catholics in Ireland in the reign\r\nof Henry VIII, long ere this peace and harmony would have prevailed\r\nbetween England and Ireland. But the very fact that a vast portion of\r\na people are disfranchised sows the seeds of continual and\r\never-recurring revolution and insurrection. It can not be otherwise.\r\nThese insurrections and revolutions, which are but the protest of our\r\ncommon humanity against wrong, are one of the scourges in the hands of\r\nProvidence to compel men to do justice and to observe the right. It is\r\nthe law of Providence, written upon every page of history, that God's\r\nvengeance follows man's wrong and oppression, and it will always be\r\nso. If you wish to avoid a war of races, if you wish to produce\r\nharmony and peace among these people, you must enfranchise them all.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, February 9th, Mr. Johnson, of Maryland, occupied\r\nthe time devoted by the Senate to a consideration of this question\r\nwith a speech against the proposed amendment of the Constitution. Mr.\r\nJohnson said that when the Constitution was framed there was no such\r\nobjection to compromising as now existed in the minds of some\r\nSenators. \"The framers of the Constitution came to the conclusion that\r\nthe good of the country demanded that there should be a compromise,\r\nand they proposed, as a compromise, the provision as it now stands;\r\nand that is, that, for the purposes of representation, a person held\r\nin slavery, or in involuntary servitude, shall be esteemed\r\nthree-fifths of a man and two-fifths property; and they established\r\nthe same rule in relation to taxation. They very wisely concluded\r\nthat, as it was all-important that some general rule should be\r\nadopted, this was the best rule, because promising more than any other\r\nrule to arrive at a just result of ascertaining the number of\r\nRepresentatives and ascertaining the quota of taxation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson did not think that the North needed such a provision as\r\nthis amendment to render her able to cope with Southern statesmanship\r\nin Congress: \"Are not the North and the statesmen of the North equal\r\nto the South and the statesmen of the South on all subjects that may\r\ncome before the councils of the nation? What is there, looking to the\r\nhistory of the two sections in the past, which would lead us to\r\nbelieve that the North is inferior to the South in any thing of\r\nintellectual improvement or of statesmanship? You have proved--and I\r\nthank God you have proved--that if listening to evil counsels,\r\nrendered effective, perhaps, by your own misjudged legislation, and by\r\nthe ill-advised course of your own population, exhibited through the\r\npress and the pulpit, a portion of the South involved the country in a\r\nwar, the magnitude of which no language can describe--you have proved\r\nyourselves, adequate to the duty of defeating, them in their mad and,\r\nas far as the letter of the Constitution is concerned, their\r\ntraitorous purpose. And now, having proved your physical manhood, do\r\nyou doubt your intellectual manhood? Mr. President, in the presence in\r\nwhich I speak, I am restrained from speaking comparatively of the\r\nSenate as it is and the Senate as it has been; but I can say this,\r\nwith as much sincerity as man ever spoke, that there is nothing to be\r\nfound in the free States calculated to disparage them properly in the\r\nestimation of the wise and the good. They are able to conduct the\r\nGovernment, and they will not be the less able because they have the\r\nadvice and the counsels of their Southern brethren.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to the position that the Southern States were not possessed\r\nof a republican form of government, Mr. Johnson remarked: \"Did our\r\nfathers consider that any one of the thirteen States who finally came\r\nunder the provisions of that Constitution, and have ever since\r\nconstituted a part of the nation, were not living under republican\r\nforms of government? The honorable member will pardon me for saying\r\nthat to suppose it is to disparage the memory of those great and good\r\nmen. There was not a State in the Union when the Constitution was\r\nadopted that was republican, if the honorable member's definition of a\r\nrepublican government is the one now to be relied upon. A property\r\nqualification was required in all at that time. Negroes were not\r\nallowed to vote, although free, in most of the States. In the Southern\r\nStates the mass of the negroes were slaves, and, of course, were not\r\nentitled to vote. If the absence of the universal right of suffrage\r\nproves that the Government is not republican, then there was not a\r\nrepublican government within the limits of the United States when the\r\nConstitution was adopted; and yet the very object of the clause to\r\nguarantee a republican government--and the honorable member's\r\ncitations prove it--was to prevent the existing governments from being\r\nchanged by revolution. It was to preserve the existing governments;\r\nand yet the honorable member would have the Senate and the country\r\nbelieve that, in the judgment of the men who framed the Constitution,\r\nthere was not a republican form of government in existence.\r\n\r\n\"The definition of the honorable member places his charge of\r\nantirepublicanism as against the present forms of constitution upon\r\nthe ground of the right to vote. I suppose the black man has no more\r\nnatural right to vote than the white man. It is the exclusion from the\r\nright that affects the judgment of the honorable member from\r\nMassachusetts. Voting, according to him, is a right derived from God;\r\nit is in every man inalienable; and its denial, therefore, is\r\ninconsistent and incompatible with the true object of a free\r\ngovernment. If it be such a right, it is not less a right in the white\r\nman than in the black man; it is not less a right in the Indian than\r\nin the white man or the black man; it is not less a right in the\r\nfemale portion of our population than in the male portion. Then the\r\nhonorable member from Massachusetts is living in an anti-republican\r\ngovernment, and he ought not to stay there a moment if he can find any\r\ngovernment which would be a government according to his theory. None\r\nhas existed since the world commenced, and it is not at all likely\r\nthat any will exist in all time to come; but if there is any such\r\ngovernment to be found on the face of the earth, let him leave\r\nMassachusetts, let him hug that angelic delusion which he hopes will\r\nencircle the whole world, and go somewhere, where he can indulge it\r\nwithout seeing before him every day conclusive evidence that no such\r\nillusion exists at home. Leave Massachusetts, I beg the honorable\r\nmember, just as soon as you can, or you will never be supremely\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Mr. Johnson remarked, referring to the recent rebels:\r\n\"Let us take them to our bosom, trust them, and as I believe in my\r\nexistence, you will never have occasion to regret it. You will, if the\r\nevent occurs, look back to your participation in it in future time\r\nwith unmingled delight, because you will be able to date from it a\r\nprosperity and a national fame of which the world furnishes no\r\nexample; and you will be able to date from, it the absence of all\r\ncause of differences which can hereafter exist, which will keep us\r\ntogether as one people, looking to one destiny, and anxious to achieve\r\none renown.\"\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, February 13th, the Senate resumed the consideration of the\r\nBasis of Representation. Mr. Summer proposed to amend the proviso\r\nrecommended by the committee--\"all persons therein of such race or\r\ncolor shall be excluded from the basis of representation\"--by adding\r\nthe words \"and they shall be exempt from taxation of all kinds.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson, of Missouri, occupied the attention of the Senate,\r\nduring a considerable part of this and the following day, in a speech\r\nagainst the proposition of the Committee of Fifteen, which he\r\nconsidered a compromise, surrendering the rights of the negro out of\r\nthe hands of the General Government into the hands of States not fit\r\nto be intrusted with them. In favor of his own amendment prohibiting\r\nthe States from disfranchising citizens on the ground of color, Mr.\r\nHenderson said: \"I propose to make the State governments republican in\r\nfact, as they are in theory. The States now have the power and do\r\nexclude the negroes for no other reason than that of color. If the\r\nnegro is equally competent and equally devoted to the Government as\r\nthe Celt, the Saxon, or the Englishman; why should he not vote? If he\r\npays his taxes, works the roads, repels foreign invasion with his\r\nmusket, assists in suppressing insurrections, fells the forest, tills\r\nthe soil, builds cities, and erects churches, what more shall he do to\r\ngive him the simple right of saying he must be only equal in these\r\nburdens, and not oppressed? My proposition is put in the least\r\noffensive form. It respects the traditionary right of the States to\r\nprescribe the qualifications of voters. It does not require that the\r\nignorant and unlettered negro shall vote. Its words are simply that\r\n'no State, in prescribing the qualifications requisite for electors\r\ntherein, shall discriminate against any person on account of color or\r\nrace.' The States may yet prescribe an educational or property test;\r\nbut any such test shall apply to white and black alike. If the black\r\nman be excluded because he is uneducated, the uneducated white man\r\nmust be excluded too. If a property test be adopted for the negro, as\r\nin New York, the same test must apply to the white man. It reaches all\r\nthe States, and not a few only, in its operation. I confess that, so\r\nfar as I am personally concerned, I would go still further and put\r\nother limitations on the power of the States in regard to suffrage;\r\nbut Senators have expressed so much distrust that even this\r\nproposition can not succeed, I have concluded to present it in a form\r\nthe least objectionable in which I could frame it. It will be observed\r\nthat this amendment, if adopted, will not prevent the State\r\nLegislatures from fixing official qualifications. They may prevent a\r\nnegro from holding any office whatever under the State organization.\r\nIt is a singular fact, however, that to-day, under the Federal\r\nConstitution, a negro may be elected President, United States Senator,\r\nor a member of the lower branch of Congress. In that instrument no\r\nqualification for office is prescribed which rejects the negro. The\r\nwhite man, not native born, may not be President, but the native-born\r\nAfrican may be. The States, however, may, in this respect,\r\nnotwithstanding this amendment, do what the Federal Constitution never\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson closed his speech with the following words: \"The reasons\r\nin favor of my proposition are inseparably connected with all I have\r\nsaid. I need not repeat them. Every consideration of peace demands it.\r\nIt must be done to remove the relics of the rebellion; it must be done\r\nto pluck out political disease from the body politic, and restore the\r\nelementary principles of our Government; it must be done to preserve\r\npeace in the States and harmony in our Federal system; it must be done\r\nto assure the happiness and prosperity of the Southern people\r\nthemselves; it must be done to establish in our institutions the\r\nprinciples of universal justice; it must be done to secure the\r\nstrongest possible guarantees against future wars; it must be done in\r\nobedience to that golden rule which insists upon doing to others what\r\nwe would that others should do unto us; it must be done if we would\r\nobey the moral law that teaches us to love our neighbors as ourselves;\r\nin fine, it must be done to purify, strengthen, and perpetuate a\r\nGovernment in which are now fondly centered the best hopes of\r\nmankind.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clark, of New Hampshire, addressed the Senate on the pending\r\nmeasure. He made the following interesting historical statements: \"As\r\nthe traveler who has passed a difficult road, when he comes to some\r\nhigh hill looks back to see the difficulties which he has passed, I\r\nturn back, and I ask the Senator to turn back, to consider what\r\noccurred, as I say, about six years ago. In the session of 1859-60, in\r\nthe old Senate-chamber, a bill was brought into the Senate of the\r\nUnited States by the then Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Brown], who\r\nwas chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, a place\r\nwhich my friend from Maine [Mr. Morrill] now so worthily fills--a bill\r\nin aid of the education of the children of this District. The bill\r\nproposed to grant certain fines and forfeitures to the use of the\r\nschools, and also proposed to tax the people ten cents on every\r\nhundred dollars of the property in this District for the purpose of\r\neducating the children. That bill proposed to tax the white man and\r\nthe black man alike; and fearing that the property of the black man\r\nwould be taxed to educate the child of the white man, I proposed an\r\namendment to the bill, that the tax collected from the black man\r\nshould go to educate the black man's child.\r\n\r\n\"There was also a further provision of the bill, that if the District\r\nraised a certain amount of money for the education of the children,\r\nthe Government of the United States would appropriate a like amount\r\nfrom the Treasury. If, for instance, you raised $20,000 by taxes on\r\nthe people in the District, the Government should pay $20,000 more, to\r\nbe added to it for the education of the children of the District. I\r\nmoved the amendment that no child whose father paid any portion of\r\nthat tax for the education of the children should be excluded from the\r\nbenefit of it, be he white or black; but that there might be no\r\ninconvenience felt, I agreed to an amendment that the black child\r\nshould not be put into the same school with the white child, but that\r\nthey should be educated in different schools to be provided for them;\r\nbut if the black man paid for educating the children of the District,\r\nhis child should be educated. There was at once an outcry, 'Why, this\r\nis social equality of the two races; this is political equality;' and\r\nthey would not consent that the black child should be educated, even\r\nwith the money of the black father. That amendment was declared to be\r\ncarried in the Senate of the United States, and after declaring it was\r\ncarried, the Senate adjourned, and after the adjournment, the chairman\r\nof that committee, Mr. Brown, appealed to me personally if I would not\r\nwithdraw it. I said to him, 'No, I would never withdraw it; if you tax\r\nthe black man, the black man should have a part of the money that you\r\nraise from him to educate his child.'\r\n\r\n\"After some days, the bill came up again in the Senate of the United\r\nStates, and the Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of the\r\nCommittee on the District of Columbia, got up and in open Senate\r\nappealed to me, 'Will the Senator from New Hampshire withdraw that\r\namendment?' 'Never, Mr. President.' 'Then,' said the Senator from\r\nMississippi, 'I will lay the bill aside, and will not ask the Senate\r\nto pass it;' and so the whole scheme failed, because they would not\r\nconsent that the money of the black man should educate his own child,\r\nand they could not vote it to educate a white child.\r\n\r\n\"Now I turn back to that time six years ago, and I mark the road that\r\nwe have come along. I mark where we struck the chains from the black\r\nman in this same District, whose child you could not educate six years\r\nago; I mark, in this Senate, at this very session, that we have passed\r\na bill in aid of the Freedmen's Bureau to secure to him his rights in\r\nthis District; I mark that all through this nation we have stricken\r\noff the chains of the slave and secured to the slave his rights\r\nelsewhere in the Union; and we have now come to the height of the\r\nhill, and are considering whether we will not enfranchise those very\r\nblack men through all the country.\"\r\n\r\nIn favor of granting political rights to the negro, Mr. Clark made the\r\nfollowing remarks: \"Mr. President, the question of the negro has\r\ntroubled the nation long. His condition as a slave troubled you; and\r\nhis condition as a freedman troubles you. Are you sick, heart-sick of\r\nthis trouble? and do you inquire when will it end? I will tell you.\r\nWhen you have given him equal rights, equal privileges, and equal\r\nsecurity with other citizens; when you have opened the way for him to\r\nbe a man, then will you have rendered exact justice which can alone\r\ninsure stability and content.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if I ever did hold that this Government was made or belonged\r\nexclusively to the white man, I should now be ashamed to avow it, or\r\nto claim for it so narrow an application. The black man has made too\r\nmany sacrifices to preserve it, and endangered his life too often in\r\nits defense to be excluded from it. The common sentiment of gratitude\r\nshould open its doors to him, if not political justice and equality.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, my house once took fire in the night-time; my two\r\nlittle boys were asleep in it, when I and their mother were away. The\r\nneighbors rushed into it, saved the children, and extinguished the\r\nflames. When I reached it, breathless and exhausted, the first\r\nexclamation was, 'Your children are safe.' Can you tell me how mean a\r\nman I should have been, and what execration I should have deserved, if\r\nthe next time those neighbors came to my house I had kicked them out\r\nof it? Tell me, then, I pray you, why two hundred thousand black men,\r\nmost of whom volunteered to fight your battles, who rushed in to save\r\nthe burning house of your Government, should not be permitted to\r\nparticipate in that Government which they helped to preserve? When you\r\nenlisted and mustered these men, when your adjutant-general went\r\nSouth, and gathered them to the recruiting-office, and persuaded them\r\nto join your ranks, did he, or any one, tell them this was the white\r\nman's Government? When they came to the rendezvous, did you point to\r\nthe sign over the door, 'Black men wanted to defend the white man's\r\nGovernment?' When you put upon them the uniform of the United States,\r\ndid you say, 'Don't disgrace it; this is the white man's Government?'\r\nWhen they toiled on the march, in the mud, the rain, and the snow, and\r\nwhen they fell out of the ranks from sheer weariness, did you cheer\r\nthem on with the encouragement that 'this is the white man's\r\nGovernment?'\r\n\r\n\"When they stood on picket on the cold, stormy night to guard you\r\nagainst surprise, did you creep up and warm their congealing blood\r\nwith an infusion of the white man's Government? When, with a wild\r\nhurrah, on the 'double-quick,' they rushed upon the enemy's guns, and\r\nbore your flag where men fell fastest and war made its wildest havoc,\r\nwhere explosion after explosion sent their mangled bodies and severed\r\nlimbs flying through the air, and they fell on glacis, ditch, and\r\nscarp and counterscarp, did you caution them against such bravery, and\r\nremind them that 'this was the white man's Government?' And when the\r\nstruggle was over, and many had fought 'their last battle,' and you\r\ngathered the dead for burial, did you exclaim, 'Poor fools! how\r\ncheated! this is the white man's Government?' No, no, sir; you\r\nbeckoned them on by the guerdon of freedom, the blessings of an equal\r\nand just Government, and a 'good time coming.'\r\n\r\n\"'White man's Government, 'do you say? Go to Fort Pillow; stand upon\r\nits ramparts and in its trenches, and recall the horrid butchery of\r\nthe black man there because he had joined you against rebellion, and\r\nthen say, if you will, 'This is the white man's Government.' Go to\r\nWagner. Follow in the track of the Massachusetts Fifty-fourth, as they\r\nwent to the terrible assault, with the guns flashing and roaring in\r\nthe darkness. Mark how unflinchingly they received the pelting iron\r\nhail into their bosoms, and how they breasted the foe! See how nobly\r\nthey supported, and how heroically they fell with their devoted\r\nleader; count the dead; pick up the severed limbs; number the wounds;\r\nmeasure the blood spilled; and remember why and wherefore and in whose\r\ncause the negro thus fought and suffered, and then say, if you can,\r\n'This is the white man's Government.' Go to Port Hudson, go to\r\nRichmond, go to Petersburg, go anywhere and every-where--to every\r\nbattle-field where the negro fought, where danger was greatest and\r\ndeath surest--and tell me, if you can, that 'this is the white man's\r\nGovernment.' And then go to Salisbury and Columbia and Andersonville,\r\nand as you shudder at the ineffable miseries of those dens, and think\r\nof those who ran the dead-line, and were not shot, but escaped to the\r\nwoods and were concealed and fed and piloted by the black men, and\r\nnever once betrayed, but often enabled to escape and return to their\r\nfriends, and then tell me if 'this is a white man's Government.'\r\n\r\n\"In ancient Rome, when one not a citizen deserved well of the\r\nrepublic, he was rewarded by the rights of citizenship, but we deny\r\nthem, and here in America--not in the Confederate States of America,\r\nwhere, attempting to found a government upon slavery and the\r\nsubjection of one race to another, it would have been fitting, if\r\nanywhere, but in the United States of America, the cardinal principle\r\nof whose Government is the equality of all men. After these black men\r\nhave so nobly fought to maintain the one and overthrow the other, when\r\nthey ask us for the necessary right of suffrage to protect themselves\r\nagainst the rebels they have fought, and with whom they are compelled\r\nto live, we coolly reply, 'This is the white man's Government.' Nay,\r\nmore, and worse, we have refused it to them, and allowed it to their\r\nand our worst enemies, the rebels. Sir, from the dim and shadowy\r\naisles of the past, there comes a cry of 'Shame! shame!' and pagan\r\nRome rebukes Christian America.\r\n\r\n\"But not chiefly, Mr. President, do I advocate this right of the black\r\nman to vote because he has fought the battles of the republic and\r\nhelped to preserve the Union, but because he is a citizen and a\r\nman--one of the people, one of the governed--upon whose consent, if\r\nthe Declaration of Independence is correct, the just powers of the\r\nGovernment rest; an intelligent being, of whom and for whom God will\r\nhave an account of us, individually and as a nation; whose blood is\r\none with ours, whose destinies are intermingled and run with ours,\r\nwhose life takes hold on immortality with ours, and because this right\r\nis necessary to develop his manhood, elevate his race, and secure for\r\nit a better civilization and a more enlightened and purer\r\nChristianity.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of February, Mr. Sumner presented a memorial from George\r\nT. Downing, Frederick Douglass, and other colored citizens of the\r\nUnited States, protesting against the pending constitutional amendment\r\nas introducing, for the first time, into the Constitution a grant to\r\ndisfranchise men on the ground of race or color. In laying this\r\nmemorial before the Senate, Mr. Sumner said: \"I do not know that I\r\nhave at any time presented a memorial which was entitled to more\r\nrespectful consideration than this, from the character of its\r\nimmediate signers and from the vast multitudes they represent. I hope\r\nI shall not depart from the proper province of presenting it if I\r\nexpress my entire adhesion to all that it says, and if I take this\r\noccasion to entreat the Senate, if they will not hearken to arguments\r\nagainst the pending proposition, that they will at least hearken to\r\nthe voice of these memorialists, representing the colored race of our\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Williams, of Oregon, argued in favor of the resolution reported by\r\nthe committee as the best measure before the Senate. He was for\r\nproceeding slowly in the work of reconstruction. In his opinion,\r\nneither the negro nor his master was now fit to vote. Upon this point\r\nhe said: \"It seems to me there can be little doubt that at this\r\nparticular time the negroes of the rebel States are unfit to exercise\r\nthe elective franchise. I have recently conversed with two officers of\r\nthe Federal army from Texas, who told me that there, in the interior\r\nand agricultural portions of the State, the negroes do not yet know\r\nthat they are free; and one of the officers told me that he personally\r\ncommunicated to several negroes for the first time the fact of their\r\nfreedom. Emancipation may be known in the towns and cities throughout\r\nthe South, but the probabilities are that in the agricultural portions\r\nof that country the negroes have no knowledge that they are free, or\r\nonly vague conceptions of their rights and duties as freemen. Sir,\r\ngive these men a little time; give them a chance to learn that they\r\nare free; give them a chance to acquire some knowledge of their rights\r\nas freemen; give them a chance to learn that they are independent and\r\ncan act for themselves; give them a chance to divest themselves of\r\nthat feeling of entire dependence for subsistence and the sustenance\r\nof their families upon the landholders of the South, to which they\r\nhave been so long accustomed; give them a little time to shake the\r\nmanacles off of their minds that have just been stricken from their\r\nhands, and I will go with the honorable Senator from Massachusetts to\r\ngive them the right of suffrage. And I will here express the hope that\r\nthe day is not far distant when every man born upon American soil,\r\nwithin the pale of civilization, may defend his manhood and his rights\r\nas a freeman by that most effective ballot which\r\n\r\n      \"'Executes the freeman's will\r\n  As lightning does the will of God.'\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the amendment proposed by Mr. Henderson, Mr. Williams said:\r\n\"All the impassioned declamation and all the vehement assertions of\r\nthe honorable Senator do not change or affect the evidence before our\r\neyes that the people of these United States are not prepared to\r\nsurrender to Congress the absolute right to determine as to the\r\nqualifications of voters in the respective States, or to adopt the\r\nproposition that all persons, without distinction of race or color,\r\nshall enjoy political rights and privileges equal to those now\r\npossessed by the white people of the country. Sir, some of the States\r\nhave lately spoken upon that subject. Wisconsin and Connecticut,\r\nNorthern, loyal, and Republican States, have recently declared that\r\nthey would not allow the negroes within their own borders political\r\nrights; and is it probable that of the thirty-six States, more than\r\nsix, at the most, would at this time adopt the constitutional\r\namendment proposed by the gentleman?\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the temporary darkness of the political sky, Mr.\r\nWilliams saw brilliant prospects before the country. \"This nation,\"\r\nsaid he, \"is to live and not die. God has written it among the shining\r\ndecrees of destiny. Inspired by this hope and animated by this faith,\r\nwe will take this country through all its present troubles and perils\r\nto the promised land of perfect unity and peace, where freedom,\r\nequality, and justice, the triune and tutelar deity of the American\r\nRepublic, will rule with righteousness a nation 'whose walls shall be\r\nsalvation and whose gates praise.'\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of this speech, the Senate being about to proceed to a\r\nvote upon the pending amendment, it was proposed to defer action and\r\nadjourn the question over to the following day, for the purpose of\r\naffording an opportunity for speeches by Senators who were not\r\nprepared to proceed immediately. Mr. Fessenden, who had the measure in\r\ncharge, protested against the delays of the Senate. \"This subject,\"\r\nsaid he, \"has dragged along now for nearly two weeks. If members\r\ndesire to address the Senate, they must be prepared to go on and do so\r\nwithout a postponement from day to day for the purpose of allowing\r\nevery gentleman to make his speech in the morning, and then adjourning\r\nearly every evening. We shall never get through in that way. I give\r\nnotice to gentlemen that I shall begin to be a little more\r\nquarrelsome--I do not know that it will do any good--after to-day.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day following, Mr. Hendricks delivered a speech of considerable\r\nlength in opposition to the constitutional amendment. After having\r\nmaintained that the proposition did not rest the right of\r\nrepresentation upon population, nor upon property, nor upon voters,\r\nMr. Hendricks inquired: \"Upon what principle do Senators propose to\r\nadopt this amendment to the Constitution? I can understand it if you\r\nsay that the States shall be represented in the House of\r\nRepresentatives upon their population; I can understand it if you say\r\nthat they shall be represented upon their voters; but when you say\r\nthat one State shall have the benefit of its non-voting population and\r\nanother State shall not, I can not understand the principle of equity\r\nand justice which governs you in that measure. Sir, if it does not\r\nstand upon a principle, upon what does it rest? It rests upon a\r\npolitical policy. A committee that had its birth in a party caucus\r\nbrings it before this body, and does not conceal the fact that it is\r\nfor party purposes. This measure, if you ever allow the Southern\r\nStates to be represented in the House of Representatives, will bring\r\nthem back shorn of fifteen or twenty Representatives; it will bring\r\nthem back so shorn in their representation that the Republican party\r\ncan control this country forever; and if you cut off from fifteen to\r\nthirty votes for President of the United States in the States that\r\nwill not vote for a Republican candidate, it may be that you can elect\r\na Republican candidate in 1868.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hendricks thought that \"this proposition was designed to\r\naccomplish three objects: first, to perpetuate the rule and power of a\r\npolitical party; in the second place, it is a proposition the tendency\r\nof which is to place agriculture under the control and power of\r\nmanufactures and commerce forever; and, in the third place, it is\r\nintended, I believe, as a punishment upon the Southern States.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to changing the basis of representation as a punishment\r\nfor the Southern States, Mr. Hendricks said: \"Now that the war is\r\nover; now that the Southern people have laid down their arms; now that\r\nthey have sought to come again fully and entirely into the Union; now\r\nthat they have pledged their honors and their fortunes to be true to\r\nthe Union and to the flag; now that they have done all that can be\r\ndone by a conquered people, is it right, after a war has been fought\r\nout, for us to take from them their political equality in this Union\r\nfor the purpose of punishment? The Senator from Maine, the chairman of\r\nthe committee, says that the right to control the suffrage is with the\r\nStates, but if the States do not choose to do right in respect to it,\r\nwe propose to punish them. You do not punish New York for not letting\r\nthe foreigner vote until he resides there a certain period. You do not\r\npunish Indiana because she will not allow a foreigner to vote until he\r\nhas been in the country a year. These States are not to be punished\r\nbecause they regulate the elective franchise according to their\r\nsovereign pleasures; but if any other States see fit to deny the right\r\nof voting to a class that is peculiarly guarded and taken care of\r\nhere, then they are to be punished.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the speech of the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr.\r\nHendricks asked: \"Had the white men of this country a right to\r\nestablish a Government, and thereby a political community? If so, they\r\nhad a right to say who should be members of that political community.\r\nThey had a right to exclude the colored man if they saw fit. Sir, I\r\nsay, in the language of the lamented Douglas, and in the language of\r\nPresident Johnson, this is the white man's Government, made by the\r\nwhite man for the white man. I am not ashamed to stand behind such\r\ndistinguished men in maintaining a sentiment like that. Nor was my\r\njudgment on the subject changed the day before yesterday by the\r\nlamentations of the Senator from New Hampshire, [Mr. Clark,] sounding\r\nthrough this body like the wailing of the winds in the dark forest,\r\n'that it is a horrible thing for a man to say that this is a white\r\nman's Government.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, there is a great deal said about the part the colored\r\nsoldiers have taken in putting down this rebellion--a great deal more\r\nthan there is any occasion for, or there is any support for in fact or\r\nhistory. This rebellion was put down by the white soldiers of this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nCriticising sentiments toward the South, expressed by Senators, Mr.\r\nHendricks said: \"We hear a good deal said about blood now. Yesterday\r\nthe Senator from Oregon [Mr. Williams] criticised the President for\r\nhis leniency toward the South. A few days ago, the Senator from Ohio\r\n[Mr. Wade] made a severe criticism on the President for his leniency,\r\nand my colleague asks for blood. Mr. President, this war commenced\r\nwith blood; nay, blood was demanded before the war. When the good men\r\nand the patriotic, North and South, representing the yearning hearts\r\nof the people at home, came here, in the winter and spring of 1861, in\r\na peace congress, if possible to avoid this dreadful war, right then\r\nthe Senator from Michigan [Mr. Chandler] announced to his Governor and\r\nthe country that this Union was scarcely worth preserving without some\r\nblood-letting. His cry before the war was for blood. Allow me to say\r\nthat when the Senator's name is forgotten because of any thing he says\r\nor does in this body, in future time it will be borne down upon the\r\npages of history as the author of the terrible sentiment that the\r\nUnion of the people that our fathers had cemented by the blood of the\r\nRevolution and by the love of the people; that that Union, resting\r\nupon compromise and concession, resting upon the doctrine of equality\r\nto all sections of the country; that that Union which brought us so\r\nmuch greatness and power in the three-quarters of a century of our\r\nlife; that that Union that had brought us so much prosperity and\r\ngreatness, until we were the mightiest and proudest nation on God's\r\nfootstool; that that grand Union was not worth preserving unless we\r\nhad some blood-letting!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler, of Michigan, replied: \"The Senator from Indiana has\r\narraigned me upon an old indictment for having written a certain\r\nletter in 1861. It is not the first time that I have been arraigned on\r\nthat indictment of 'blood-letting.' I was first arraigned for it upon\r\nthis floor by the traitor John C. Breckinridge; and I answered the\r\ntraitor John C. Breckinridge; and after I gave him his answer, he went\r\nout into the rebel ranks and fought against our flag. I was arraigned\r\nby another Senator from Kentucky and by other traitors upon this\r\nfloor. I expect to be arraigned again. I wrote the letter, and I stand\r\nby the letter; and what was in it? What was the position of the\r\ncountry when that letter was written? The Democratic party, as an\r\norganization, had arrayed itself against this Government--a Democratic\r\ntraitor in the presidential chair, and a Democratic traitor in every\r\ndepartment of this Government; Democratic traitors preaching treason\r\nupon this floor, and preaching treason in the hall of the other house;\r\nDemocratic traitors in your army and in your navy; Democratic traitors\r\ncontrolling every branch of this Government. Your flag was fired upon,\r\nand there was no response. The Democratic party had ordained that this\r\nGovernment should be overthrown; and I, a Senator from the State of\r\nMichigan, wrote to the Governor of that State, 'Unless you are\r\nprepared to shed blood for the preservation of this great Government,\r\nthe Government is overthrown.' That is all there was to that letter.\r\nThat I said, and that I say again; and I tell that Senator if he is\r\nprepared to go down in history with the Democratic traitors who then\r\ncoöperated with him, I am prepared to go down on that 'blood-letting'\r\nletter, and I stand by the record as then made.\" [Applause in the\r\ngalleries.]\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of February, Mr. Howard, of Michigan, offered an amendment\r\nproviding that the right of suffrage should be enjoyed by all persons\r\nof African descent belonging to the following classes: those who have\r\nbeen in the military service of the United States, those who can read\r\nand write, and those who possess $250 worth of property.\r\n\r\nMr. Yates, of Illinois, addressed the Senate for three hours on the\r\npending amendment of the Constitution. On the 29th of January\r\npreceding, Mr. Yates had proposed a bill providing that no State or\r\nTerritory should make any distinction between citizens on account of\r\nrace, or color, or condition; and that all citizens, without\r\ndistinction of race, color, or condition should be protected in the\r\nenjoyment and exercise of all their civil and political rights,\r\nincluding the right of suffrage.\r\n\r\nThis bill Mr. Yates made the basis of his argument. His reason for\r\npreferring a bill to a constitutional amendment was presented as\r\nfollows: \"There is only one way of salvation for the country. Your\r\namendments to the Constitution of the United States can not be\r\nadopted. If we have not the power now under the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States to secure full freedom, then, sir, we shall not have it,\r\nand there is no salvation whatever for the country. Let not freedom\r\ndie in the house, and by the hands of her friends.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon. Richard Yates.]\r\n\r\nMr. Yates maintained that the constitutional amendment abolishing\r\nslavery gave to Congress power to legislate to the full extent of the\r\nmeasure proposed by him. \"Let gentlemen come forward,\" said he, \"and\r\nmeet the issue like men. Let them come forward and do what they have\r\nby the Constitution the clear power to do, and that is a _sine qua\r\nnon_ in order to carry into effect the constitutional prohibition of\r\nslavery. As for me, I would rather face the music and meet the\r\nresponsibility like a man, and send to the people of the State of\r\nIllinois the boon of universal suffrage, and of a full and complete\r\nemancipation, than meet the taunt of Northern demagogues that I would\r\nforce suffrage upon North Carolina, and Tennessee, and Delaware, while\r\nI had not the courage to prescribe it for our own free States. Sir, it\r\nwill be the crime of the century if now, having the power, as we\r\nclearly have, we lack the nerve to do the work that is given us to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\"Let me say to my Republican friends, you are too late. You have gone\r\ntoo far to recede now. Four million people, one-seventh of your whole\r\npopulation, you have set free. Will you start back appalled at the\r\nenchantment your own wand has called up? The sequences of your own\r\nteachings are upon you. As for me, I start not back appalled when\r\nuniversal suffrage confronts me. When the bloody ghost of slavery\r\nrises, I say, 'Shake your gory locks at me; I did it.' I accept the\r\nsituation. I fight not against the logic of events or the decrees of\r\nProvidence. I expected it, sir, and I meet it half way. I am for\r\nuniversal suffrage. I bid it 'All hail!' 'All hail!'\r\n\r\n\"Four million people set free! What will protect them? The ballot.\r\nWhat alone will give us a peaceful and harmonious South? The ballot to\r\nall. What will quench the fires of discord, give us back all the\r\nStates, a restored Union, and make us one people? The ballot, and that\r\nalone. Is there no other way? None other under the sun. There is no\r\nother salvation.\r\n\r\n\"The ballot will lead the freedman over the Red Sea of our troubles.\r\nIt will be the brazen serpent, upon which he can look and live. It\r\nwill be his pillar of cloud by day, and his pillar of fire by night.\r\nIt will lead him to Pisgah's shining height, and across Jordan's\r\nstormy waves, to Canaan's fair and happy land. Sir, the ballot is the\r\nfreedman's Moses. So far as man is concerned, I might say that Mr.\r\nLincoln was the Moses of the freedmen; but whoever shall be the truest\r\nfriend of human freedom, whoever shall write his name highest upon the\r\nhorizon of public vision as the friend of human liberty, that man--and\r\nI hope it may be the present President of the United States--will be\r\nthe Joshua to lead the people into the land of deliverance.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Yates maintained that for the exercise of the right of suffrage\r\nthere should be no test of intelligence, wealth, rank or race. To\r\nbring the people up to the proper standard, the ballot itself was \"the\r\ngreatest educator.\" He said: \"Let a man have an interest in the\r\nGovernment, a voice as to the men and measures by which his taxes, his\r\nproperty, his life, and his reputation shall be determined, and there\r\nwill be a stimulus to education for that man.\r\n\r\n\"As the elective franchise has been extended in this country, we have\r\nseen education become more universal. Look throughout all our Northern\r\nStates at our schools and colleges, our academies of learning, our\r\nassociations, the pulpit, the press, and the numerous agencies for the\r\npromotion of intelligence, all the inevitable offspring of our free\r\ninstitutions. Here is the high training which inspires the eloquence\r\nof the Senate, the wisdom of the cabinet, the address of the\r\ndiplomatist, and which has developed and brought to light that\r\nintelligent and energetic mind which has elevated the character and\r\ncontributed to the prosperity of the country. It is the ballot which\r\nis the stimulus to improvement, which fires the heart of youthful\r\nambition, which stimulates honorable aspiration, which penetrates the\r\nthick shades of the forest, and takes the poor rail-splitter by the\r\nhand and points him to the shining height of human achievement, or\r\nwhich goes into the log hut of the tailor boy and opens to him the\r\navenue of the presidential mansion.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Yates then declared his confidence in the triumph of the principle\r\nof universal suffrage: \"It is my conscientious conviction that if\r\nevery Senator on this floor, and every Representative in the other\r\nHouse, and the President of the United States, should, with united\r\nvoices, attempt to oppose this grand consummation of universal\r\nequality, they will fail. It is too late for that. You may go to the\r\nhead-waters of the Mississippi and turn off the little rivulets, but\r\nyou can not go to the mouth, after it has collected its waters from a\r\nthousand rivers, and with accumulated volume is pouring its foaming\r\nwaters into the Gulf, and say, 'Thus far shalt thou go and no\r\nfurther.'\r\n\r\n\"It is too late to change the tide of human progress. The enlightened\r\nconvictions of the masses, wrought by the thorough discussions of\r\nthirty years, and consecrated by the baptism of precious blood, can\r\nnot now be changed. The hand of a higher power than man's is in this\r\nrevolution, and it will not move backward. It is of no use to fight\r\nagainst destiny. God, not man, created men equal. Deep laid in the\r\nsolid foundations of God's eternal throne, the principle of equality\r\nis established, indestructible and immortal.\r\n\r\n\"Senators, sixty centuries of the past are looking down upon you. All\r\nthe centuries of the future are calling upon you. Liberty, struggling\r\namid the rise and wrecks of empires in the past, and yet to struggle\r\nfor life in all the nations of the world, conjures you to seize this\r\ngreat opportunity which the providence of Almighty God has placed in\r\nyour hands to bless the world and make your names immortal, to carry\r\nto full and triumphant consummation the great work begun by your\r\nfathers, and thus lay permanently, solidly, and immovably, the\r\ncap-stone upon the pyramid of human liberty.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of February, the proposed amendment being again before the\r\nSenate, Mr. Buckalew, of Pennsylvania, delivered an elaborate speech\r\nin opposition to the measure. He had previously refrained from\r\nspeech-making, supposing that \"while the passions of the country were\r\ninflamed by the war, reason could not be heard.\" He regretted that\r\nquestions pertaining to the war still occupied the attention of\r\nCongress to the exclusion of those connected with economy, revenue,\r\nfinance, ordinary legislation, and the administration of\r\njustice--questions which require intelligence, investigation, labor,\r\nand the habits of the student. As an argument against changing the\r\nbasis of representation as it existed, Mr. Buckalew gave statistical\r\ndetails, showing the various ratios of representation in the Senate,\r\nas possessed respectively by the East, West and South. He maintained\r\nthat New England had too great a preponderance of power in the Senate,\r\nboth, as to membership and the chairmanships of committees, \"While,\"\r\nsaid he, \"the population of the East is less than one-seventh of the\r\npopulation of the States represented in the Senate, she has the\r\nchairmanships of one-third of the committees. The chairmanship of a\r\ncommittee is a position of much influence and power. The several\r\ndistinguished gentlemen holding that position have virtual control\r\nover the transaction of business, both in committee and in the\r\nSenate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Buckalew thus presented the effect of restoration of\r\nrepresentation to the Southern States upon the relative position of\r\nNew England: \"Twenty-two Senators from the Southern States and two\r\nfrom Colorado--being double the number of those from the East--would\r\nreduce the importance of the latter in the Senate and remit her back\r\nto the condition in which she stood in her relations to the Union\r\nbefore the war. True, she would even then possess much more than her\r\nproportion of weight in the Senate, regard being had to her\r\npopulation, but she would no longer dominate or control the Government\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Buckalew argued at some length that representation should continue\r\nto be based upon population. He thought that the two-fifths added to\r\nthe representative population in the South by the abolition of slavery\r\nwould be counterbalanced by the mortality of the slave population\r\nsince the outbreak of the war. He then presented the following\r\nobjections to \"any propositions of amendments at this time by\r\nCongress:\"\r\n\r\n\"1. Eleven States are unrepresented in the Senate and House. They are\r\nnot heard in debate which may affect their interests and welfare in\r\nall future time.\r\n\r\n\"2. Any amendment made at this time will be a partisan amendment.\r\n\r\n\"3. The members of this Congress were not chosen with reference to the\r\nsubject of constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\n\"4. Whatever amendments are now proposed by Congress are to be\r\nsubmitted to Legislatures, and not to popular conventions in the\r\nStates; and most of those Legislatures are to be the ones now in\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n\"5. In submitting amendments at this time, we invite a dispute upon\r\nthe question of the degree of legislative assent necessary to their\r\nadoption. If ratified by the Legislatures of less than three-fourths\r\nof all the States, their validity will be denied, and their\r\nenforcement resisted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, replied to Mr. Buckalew's imputations\r\nagainst New England. \"The Senator gave us to understand that he had\r\nnot wasted reason, thought, and culture upon the stormy passions\r\nengendered by the war, but now, when reason had resumed her empire, he\r\nhad come forth to instruct his country.\r\n\r\n\"The Senators from New England, unlike the Senator from Pennsylvania,\r\nremained not silent during the great civil war through which the\r\nnation has passed. They have spoken; they have spoken for the unity of\r\ntheir country and the freedom of all men. They have spoken for their\r\ncountry, their whole country, and for the rights of all its people of\r\nevery race. Their past is secure, and the imputations of the Senator\r\nfrom Pennsylvania will pass harmless by them.\r\n\r\n\"When the Constitution was formed, New England had eight of the\r\ntwenty-six Senators--nearly one-third of the body; now she has twelve\r\nof the seventy-two Senators--one-sixth of the body. Her power is\r\ndiminishing in this body and will continue to diminish. When the\r\nConstitution was adopted, quite as great inequalities existed among\r\nthe States as now. The illustrious statesmen who framed the\r\nConstitution knew and recognized that fact; they based the Senate upon\r\nthe States, and upon the equality of the States. They were so\r\ndetermined in that policy of equal State representation in the Senate\r\nthat they provided that the Constitution should never be amended in\r\nthat respect without the consent of every State.\r\n\r\n\"The Senator suggests that the Senators from New England are actuated\r\nby local interests and love of power in their action regarding the\r\nadmission of the Representatives of the rebel States. Nothing can be\r\nmore unjust to those Senators. It is without the shadow of fairness or\r\njustice, or the semblance of truth. I can say before God that I am\r\nactuated by no local interests, no love of power, in opposing the\r\nimmediate and unconditional admission of the rebel States into these\r\nchambers; and I know my associates from New England too well to\r\nbelieve for a moment that they are actuated by interest or the love of\r\npower. Thousands of millions of money have been expended, and hundreds\r\nof thousands of brave men have bled for the unity and liberty of the\r\nrepublic. I desire--my associates from New England desire--to see\r\nthese vacant chairs filled at an early day by the Representatives of\r\nthe States that rebelled and rushed into civil war. We will welcome\r\nthem here; but before they come it is of vital importance to the\r\ncountry, to the people of all sections, to the interests of all, that\r\nall disturbing questions should be forever adjusted, and so adjusted\r\nas never again to disturb the unity and peace of the country. It is\r\nnow the time to settle forever all matters that can cause estrangement\r\nand sectional agitations and divisions in the future. Nothing should\r\nbe left to bring dissensions, and, it may be, civil war again upon our\r\ncountry. The blood poured out to suppress the rebellion must not be\r\nshed in vain.\"\r\n\r\nProminent Republican Senators bringing earnest opposition to bear\r\nagainst the proposed constitutional amendment, and a sentiment\r\nevidently gaining ground that it did not meet the requirements of the\r\ncase, caused its friends to urge it with less zeal than had at first\r\ncharacterized them. Meanwhile, other important propositions coming up\r\nfrom the Committee of Fifteen, which occupied the attention of the\r\nSenate, as detailed in a subsequent chapter, the subject of changing\r\nthe basis of representation was allowed to lie over for nearly a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of March, the subject being resumed, Mr. Pomeroy addressed\r\nthe Senate. He feared that the nation was not ready to adopt a\r\nconstitutional amendment such as the necessities of the country\r\nrequired. \"This nation,\" said he, \"although severely disciplined, has\r\nnot yet reached the point of giving to all men their rights by a\r\nsuffrage amendment; three-fourths of the States are not ready. And any\r\npatchwork, any 'step toward it' (as said the chairman of the\r\ncommittee) which does not reach it, I fear to take, because but one\r\nopportunity will ever be afforded us to step at all; and lost\r\nopportunities are seldom repeated.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pomeroy did not think the case was without remedy, however, since\r\n\"the last constitutional amendment embraced all, gave the most ample\r\npowers, even if they did not exist before; for, after having secured\r\nthe freedom of all men wherever the old flag floats, it provided that\r\nCongress might 'secure' the same by 'appropriate legislation.'\r\n\r\n\"What more could it have said? And who are better judges of\r\nappropriate legislation than the very men who first passed the\r\namendment and provided for this very case?\r\n\r\n\"Sir, what is 'appropriate legislation' on the subject, namely,\r\nsecuring the freedom of all men? It can be nothing less than throwing\r\nabout all men the essential safeguards of the Constitution. The 'right\r\nto bear arms' is not plainer taught or more efficient than the right\r\nto carry ballots. And if appropriate legislation will secure the one,\r\nso can it also the other. And if both are necessary, and provided for\r\nin the Constitution as now amended, why, then, let us close the\r\nquestion of congressional legislation.\r\n\r\n\"Let us not take counsel of our own fears, but of our hopes; not of\r\nour enemies, but of our friends. By all the memories which cluster\r\nabout the pathway in which we have been led; by all the sacrifices,\r\nsuffering, blood, and tears of the conflict; by all the hopes of a\r\nfreed country and a disenthralled race; yea, as a legacy for mankind,\r\nlet us now secure a free representative republic, based upon impartial\r\nsuffrage and that human equality made clear in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. To this entertainment let us invite our countrymen and\r\nall nations, committing our work, when done, to the verdict of\r\nposterity and the blessing of Almighty God.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day following, Mr. Saulsbury took the floor. His speech,\r\nostensibly against the pending measure, was a palliation of the\r\nconduct of the Southern States, and a plea for their right of being\r\nadmitted to representation in Congress. All that the Senator said\r\ndirectly upon the subject under discussion was contained in the\r\nfollowing paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"Now, suppose your constitutional amendment passes. If it passes, it\r\nought to meet with the respect of some body. If this constitutional\r\namendment shall be presented to the States who are now represented in\r\nCongress, and shall be adopted by simply three-fourths of those\r\nStates, is there any body that will have the least respect for it?\r\nThen suppose you could go with the bayonet--which I think now, under\r\nthe brighter dawn of a better day which we begin to realize, you are\r\nnot going to have the liberty to do--suppose you were to go with the\r\nbayonet and present it to the other eleven States, and they, acting\r\nunder duress, not as free agents and as free men, could get some\r\npeople in their section so miserable and poor in spirit and craven in\r\nsoul as to vote to adopt in their Legislatures such an amendment,\r\nwould it command the respect of any body in this land? Not at all.\r\nOpen your doors, sir; admit the Representatives of the Southern States\r\nto seats in this body; require no miserable degrading oath of them;\r\nadminister to them the very oath that you first took when you entered\r\nthis body, and the only oath that the Constitution of the United\r\nStates requires, and the only oath which Congress has any right to\r\nexact, an oath to support the Constitution of the United States; and\r\nthen, if you think your Constitution is defective, if you think it\r\nneeds further amendment, or if you have not sufficiently exhausted\r\nyour bowels of mercy and love and kindness toward your sable friends\r\nwhose shadows darken this gallery every day, submit your amendments to\r\nthe States represented in the Congress of the United States; and if\r\nthey choose, acting freely as citizens of their States, to agree to\r\nyour amendments, it will command the respect of themselves, but still\r\nit will not command mine. I should despise a people who would\r\nvoluntarily assume so degrading a position.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of March, Mr. Sumner occupied the attention of the Senate\r\nfor three hours, with a second speech in opposition to the proposed\r\nconstitutional amendment. He used very strong language to express his\r\nabhorrence of the proposition: \"It reminds me of that leg of mutton\r\nserved for dinner on the road from London to Oxford, which Dr.\r\nJohnson, with characteristic energy, described 'as bad as bad could\r\nbe, ill-fed, ill-killed, ill-kept, and ill-dressed.' So this\r\ncompromise--I adopt the saying of an eminent friend, who insists that\r\nit can not be called an 'amendment,' but rather a 'detriment' to the\r\nConstitution--is as bad as bad can be; and even for its avowed purpose\r\nit is uncertain, loose, cracked, and rickety. Regarding it as a\r\nproposition from Congress to meet the unparalleled exigencies of the\r\npresent hour, it is no better than the 'muscipular abortion' sent into\r\nthe world by the 'parturient mountain.' But it is only when we look at\r\nthe chance of good from it that this proposition is 'muscipular.'\r\nRegarding it in every other aspect it is infinite, inasmuch as it\r\nmakes the Constitution a well-spring of insupportable thralldom, and\r\nonce more lifts the sluices of blood destined to run until it comes to\r\nthe horse's bridle. Adopt it, and you will put millions of\r\nfellow-citizens under the ban of excommunication; you will hand them\r\nover to a new anathema maranatha; you will declare that they have no\r\npolitical rights 'which white men are bound to respect,' thus\r\nrepeating in a new form that abomination which has blackened the name\r\nof Taney. Adopt it, and you will stimulate anew the war of race upon\r\nrace. Slavery itself was a war of race upon race, and this is only a\r\nnew form of this terrible war. The proposition is as hardy as it is\r\ngigantic; for it takes no account of the moral sense of mankind, which\r\nis the same as if in rearing a monument we took no account of the law\r\nof gravitation. It is the paragon and masterpiece of ingratitude,\r\nshowing more than any other act of history what is so often charged\r\nand we so fondly deny, that republics are ungrateful. The freedmen ask\r\nfor bread, and you send them a stone. With piteous voice they ask for\r\nprotection. You thrust them back unprotected into the cruel den of\r\ntheir former masters. Such an attempt, thus bad as bad can be, thus\r\nabortive for all good, thus perilous, thus pregnant with a war of race\r\nupon race, thus shocking to the moral sense, and thus treacherous to\r\nthose whom we are bound to protect, can not be otherwise than\r\nshameful. Adopt it, and you will cover the country with dishonor.\r\nAdopt it, and you will fix a stigma upon the very name of republic. As\r\nto the imagination, there are mountains of light, so are there\r\nmountains of darkness; and this is one of them. It is the very\r\nKoh-i-noor of blackness. Adopt this proposition, and you will be\r\nlittle better than the foul Harpies who defiled the feast that was\r\nspread. The Constitution is the feast spread for our country, and you\r\nare now hurrying to drop into its text a political obscenity, and to\r\nspread on its page a disgusting ordure,\r\n\r\n                    \"'Defiling all you find,\r\n  And parting leave a loathsome stench behind.'\"\r\n\r\nHaving presented his objections to the pending proposition, at great\r\nlength, he summed them up as follows: \"You have seen, first, how this\r\nproposition carries into the Constitution itself the idea of\r\nInequality of Rights, thus defiling that unspotted text; secondly, how\r\nit is an express sanction of the acknowledged tyranny of taxation\r\nwithout representation; thirdly, how it is a concession to State\r\nRights at a moment when we are recovering from a terrible war waged\r\nagainst us in the name of State Rights; fourthly, how it is the\r\nconstitutional recognition of an oligarchy, aristocracy, caste, and\r\nmonopoly founded on color; fifthly, how it petrifies in the\r\nConstitution the wretched pretensions of a white man's government;\r\nsixthly, how it assumes what is false in constitutional law, that\r\ncolor can be a 'qualification' for an elector; seventhly, how it\r\npositively ties the hands of Congress in fixing the meaning of a\r\nrepublican government, so that, under the guarantee clause, it will be\r\nconstrained to recognize an oligarchy, aristocracy, caste, and\r\nmonopoly founded on color, together with the tyranny of taxation\r\nwithout representation, as not inconsistent with such a government;\r\neighthly, how it positively ties the hands of Congress in completing\r\nand consummating the abolition of slavery according to the second\r\nclause of the constitutional amendment, so that it can not, for this\r\npurpose, interfere with the denial of the elective franchise on\r\naccount of color; ninthly, how it installs recent rebels in permanent\r\npower over loyal citizens; and, tenthly, how it shows forth, in\r\nunmistakable character, as a compromise of human rights, the most\r\nimmoral, indecent, and utterly shameful of any in our history. All\r\nthis you have seen, with pain and sorrow, I trust. Who that is moved\r\nto sympathy for his fellow-man can listen to the story without\r\nindignation? Who that has not lost the power of reason can fail to see\r\nthe cruel wrong?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle mentioned some facts which he thought would prove the\r\napprehension of an increase of the basis of representation in the\r\nSouth to be without foundation. \"The destruction of the population,\"\r\nsaid he, \"both white and black, during the civil war, has been most\r\nenormous. Of the white population, there were in those States in 1860,\r\nof white males over twenty years of age, about one million six hundred\r\nthousand. Nearly one-third of that white population over twenty years\r\nof age has perished. The actual destruction of the black population\r\nsince 1860 has been at least twenty-five per cent. of the whole\r\npopulation. The population of the South has been so destroyed and\r\nwasted and enfeebled in consequence of this war, that I do not for\r\none, I confess, feel those apprehensions which some entertain that, if\r\nthey are admitted to representation under the Constitution just as it\r\nstands, they will have any increase of Representatives. My opinion is,\r\nthat after the next census their representation will be diminished\r\nunless emigration from the North or from Europe shall fill up their\r\npopulation and increase it so as to entitle it to an increased\r\nrepresentation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle argued that the amendment was capable of being evaded by\r\na State disposed to disfranchise colored men: \"I do not see,\" said he,\r\n\"that there is any thing in the resolution which would prevent South\r\nCarolina or any other State from passing a law that any person who was\r\nborn free, or whose ancestors were free, should exercise the elective\r\nfranchise, and none others. That would exclude the whole of the\r\ncolored population, and yet would leave the State to have its full\r\nrepresentation. There is nothing which would prevent the State of\r\nSouth Carolina or any other State from saying that only those persons\r\nwho had served in the military service, and their descendants, should\r\nexercise the elective franchise. That would exclude the colored\r\npopulation, and the Union population, too, if they refused to serve in\r\nthe army.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle closed his remarks by advocating an amendment basing\r\nrepresentation upon actual voters under State laws.\r\n\r\nMr. Morrill, of Maine, addressed the Senate in support of the\r\nproposition to amend the Constitution. He said: \"Some amendment is\r\nrendered absolutely necessary, unless the American Constitution is to\r\ngive to the nation the expression of utterly contradictory sentiments,\r\nsaying involuntary servitude no longer exists, in one portion of it;\r\nin another, bearing on its front in marked contrast, that three-fifths\r\nonly of the 'other persons' are to still constitute the basis of\r\nrepresentation.\"\r\n\r\nHe recalled a time not far remote when amendments of the Constitution\r\nwere adopted by those who now oppose any alteration of the fundamental\r\nlaw: \"I do not forget,\" said he, \"that within the last five years a\r\nclass of statesmen and politicians, who now resist all propositions\r\nfor an amendment of the Constitution, here and elsewhere urged and\r\ndemanded amendments of the Constitution of the nation. What were the\r\ncircumstances then? Several States threatened to dissolve this Union;\r\nseveral States had taken an attitude hostile to the Government of the\r\ncountry. They demanded the extension, the protection, and the\r\nperpetuation of slavery; and upon that question the country was\r\ndivided. Then amendments to the Constitution were proposed without\r\nnumber here, elsewhere, and every-where. Amendments to the\r\nConstitution seemed to be the order of the day. To what end, and for\r\nwhat purpose? To increase the power in the hands of the few who\r\nwielded the political power in those States, and who were demanding\r\nit.\r\n\r\nReferring to an argument presented by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr.\r\nMorrill remarked: \"But yesterday we had an additional reason given why\r\nthis amendment should not be adopted; and that was that it was wholly\r\nunnecessary, because, it was said, by the events which were\r\ntranspiring in the country in regard to the recent slave population,\r\nthere need be no apprehension of excess of representation based on the\r\nwhole 'numbers' instead of three-fifths, from the important fact that\r\nthey were passing away. If I gather the force of that argument, it is\r\nthis: we are to base no legislation and no action upon the idea that\r\nthis race, recently slave, now free, is part and parcel of the\r\nAmerican people, the object of our care, solicitude, and protection.\r\nThey are passing away--dying; let them be represented as slaves now,\r\nand let them never enter into the basis hereafter of the\r\nrepresentative system. Sir, that is the old argument--an argument\r\nworthy of another period than this. Our people have been an inexorable\r\npeople, in some respects, in regard to the races that have been within\r\ntheir power. In the march of our civilization across the continent,\r\nthe iron heel of that civilization has rested upon the Indian, and he\r\nis passing away. We seem to contemplate the probable extinction of the\r\nIndians from our limits with composure. He is a nomad; he is a savage;\r\nhe is a barbarian; he is not within our morals or our code of law; he\r\nis not within the pale of the Constitution, but flits upon the verge\r\nof it, outside our protection, the subject of our caprices, and\r\nsometimes, I think, of our avarice. And, now, if any consequence is to\r\nbe attached to the remark of the honorable Senator from Wisconsin [Mr.\r\nDoolittle] yesterday, this 'inferior race' is not to be the subject of\r\nour solicitude. They, too, are passing away; it is not worth while to\r\nchange your Constitution in regard to them. Let them be represented as\r\ntwo-fifths slaves on the old basis until they shall have perished, and\r\nthen your Constitution will need no amendment. The laws of a fearful\r\nantagonism of superior and inferior races are expected to accomplish\r\nwhat, if American statesmanship does not incite, it contemplates with\r\napparent satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, profoundly regretted to see indications\r\nthat the amendment was doomed to defeat. He said: \"My heart, my\r\nconscience, and my judgment approve of this amendment, and I support\r\nit without qualification or reservation. I approve of the purpose for\r\nwhich it is introduced. I approve it because I believe it would sweep\r\nthe loyal States by an immense majority; that no public man could\r\nstand before the people of the loyal States in opposition to it, or\r\noppose it with any force whatever. I approve it because I believe if\r\nit were put in the Constitution every black man in America, before\r\nfive years could pass, would be enfranchised and weaponed with the\r\nballot for the protection of life, liberty, and property.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the opposition brought to bear against the measure by his\r\ncolleague, Mr. Wilson said: \"We are also told that it is immoral and\r\nindecent, an offense to reason and to conscience. Sir, this measure\r\ncame into Congress with the sanction of the Committee on\r\nReconstruction, composed as it is of men of individual honor and\r\npersonal character, and as true to the cause of the colored race as\r\nany other men here or elsewhere. It comes to the Senate by an\r\noverwhelming vote of the House of Representatives. It is sustained by\r\nninety-nine out of every hundred of the public journals that brought\r\nthe present Administration into power, and were it submitted to the\r\nAmerican people, it would, I am quite sure, be sustained by men in the\r\nloyal States who believe that the soldier who fought the battles of\r\nthe republic is the equal of the traitor who fought against the\r\ncountry. I see no compromise in it, no surrender in it, no defilement\r\nof the Constitution in it, no implication that can be drawn from it\r\nagainst the rights or interests of the colored race. On the contrary,\r\nI believe the black men, from the Potomac to the Rio Grande, would go\r\nfor it and rejoice to see it adopted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson described the results that would follow the adoption of\r\nthis amendment. \"Being incorporated in the Constitution, the practical\r\neffect would be this, and only this: it would raise up a party in\r\nevery one of these States immediately in favor of the enfranchisement\r\nof the colored race. That party might be animated and influenced by\r\nthe love of power, by pride, and by ambition. These men might begin\r\nthe contest, for they would not like to yield the power of their\r\nStates in Congress; they might begin the battle animated by no high\r\nand lofty motives; but as soon as the discussion commenced, it would\r\naddress itself to the reason, to the heart, and to the conscience of\r\nthe people. The advocates of negro enfranchisement would themselves\r\nspeedily grow up to believe in the justice, equity, and right of\r\ngiving the ballot to the black men. There would be discussion on every\r\nsquare mile of the rebel States. Appeals would be made to their pride,\r\nto their ambition, to their justice, to their love of fair play, to\r\ntheir equity; all the interests and passions, and all the loftier\r\nmotives that can sway, control, and influence men, would impel them to\r\naction. They would coöperate with the friends of freedom throughout\r\nthe country; would seek their counsel and aid. They would be the left\r\nwing of the great army of freedom, of elevation, and improvement in\r\nthe country. We would give them our influence, our voices, and our aid\r\nin fighting the battle of enfranchisement. They would have the support\r\nand the prayers of the poor black men of the South; and before five\r\nyears had passed away, there would not be a rebel State that did not\r\nenfranchise the bondman.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the policy of \"enlightened Christian States,\" in refusing\r\nthe right of suffrage to the negro, Mr. Wilson said: \"After all the\r\nfidelity and heroic conduct of these men, prejudice, party spirit, and\r\nconservatism, and all that is base and mean on earth, combine to deny\r\nthe right of suffrage to the brave soldier of the republic. God alone\r\ncan forgive such meanness; humanity can not. After what has taken\r\nplace, is taking place, I can not hope that the constitutional\r\namendment proposed by the Senator from Missouri will receive a\r\nmajority of three-fourths of the votes of the States. I, therefore,\r\ncan not risk the cause of an emancipated race upon it. In the present\r\ncondition of the nation we must aim at practical results, not to\r\nestablish political theories, however beautiful and alluring they may\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the understanding of the Senate that the discussion would close\r\nand the vote would be taken on the 9th of March. On that day Mr.\r\nFessenden took the floor in reply to objections urged by those who had\r\npreviously spoken. In reply to the objection that the advocates of\r\nthis measure were wrong in attempting to accomplish by indirection\r\nthat which they could not accomplish directly, Mr. Fessenden said: \"If\r\nnegro suffrage can be secured by the indirect action of an amendment\r\nof the Constitution which appeals to the interest of those who have\r\nhitherto been and who are yet probably the ruling class among whom\r\nthis large population is situated, and with whom they live, it will be\r\nfar better than to run the risk of all the difficulties that might\r\narise from a forcible imposition, which would create ill-feeling,\r\ngenerate discord, and produce, perhaps undying animosities.\"\r\n\r\nTo the objection urged by Mr. Hendricks, that it was intended for a\r\nparty purpose, Mr. Fessenden replied: \"Has he any right to attack the\r\nmotives of those who support it? Must it necessarily be attended with\r\nbenefit to a particular party? If so, it is necessarily attended with\r\ninjury to another party, of which the honorable Senator is a prominent\r\nmember; and it would as well become me to say that his opposition to\r\nit is for party purposes and for party objects as it became him to say\r\nthat its introduction and its support were intended for party\r\npurposes. It is well known here and out of this Senate that the\r\nhonorable Senator from Indiana is a gentleman who never, in any of his\r\naddresses here, says any thing that is in the slightest degree\r\ncalculated to effect a party purpose, and has so little of that party\r\nfeeling which presses itself upon other men as to be hardly suspected\r\nof being a party man at all.\" [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden thus replied to the objections of two opponents of the\r\nmeasure: \"The Senator [Mr. Hendricks] objected to this measure upon\r\nanother ground, and that was, that in one sense it was intended as a\r\npunishment, and that was wrong; and in another sense it was what he\r\ncalled a bribe, a reward, and that was wrong. If he considers it a\r\npunishment, he differs very much from his leading associate on this\r\nquestion, the honorable Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Sumner,] for\r\nhe does not consider it a punishment at all. The Senator from\r\nMassachusetts says there is nothing punitive in it. On the contrary,\r\nit is a reward to these States; it is conferring power upon them; it\r\nis strengthening power in the hands of the whites of the South, and\r\nonly oppressing the colored race. Behold how doctors disagree! They\r\noperate upon the same patient, and are operating at the same time,\r\nwith different remedies and in different directions.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose it is a punishment, and suppose it is a bribe, a reward; it\r\ndoes not differ very much from the principle upon which all criminal\r\nlegislation is founded, to say the least of it. We punish men when\r\nthey do wrong. I never heard that it was an objection to legislation\r\nthat it punished those who perpetrate a wrong. I never heard that it\r\nwas an objection to legislation that it held out rewards to those who\r\ndid right.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to Mr. Buckalew's argument, Mr. Fessenden remarked: \"Eight\r\nout of sixteen pages of his speech were devoted to abuse of New\r\nEngland, and to showing that New England had too much power, and that\r\nit ought to be abridged in some way. \"He closed those remarks by\r\nsaying (for which I was very much obliged to him) that he did not\r\ndespise New England. We are happy to know it. I will say to him that\r\nNew England does not despise him that I am aware of. [Laughter.] I am\r\nnot aware that it is really affected in any degree by the elaborate\r\nattack of eight pages which he delivered against New England on that\r\noccasion, and which he thought were views so important that he could\r\nnot be justified if he failed to give them utterance.\"\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Sumner's part in the debate, Mr. Fessenden said: \"On this\r\nsubject I think he has occupied about eight or nine hours of the time\r\nof the Senate, and on the last occasion, while saying that principles\r\nwere to be considered, he has undertaken to designate the character of\r\nthis proposed amendment. I have already stated who the men were who\r\nwere in favor of it. What does the Senator call it? I have chosen a\r\nfew, and but a few, flowers of rhetoric from the speech of the\r\nhonorable Senator: 'Compromise of human rights,' 'violating the\r\nnational faith,' 'dishonoring the name of there public,' 'bad mutton,'\r\n'new muscipular abortion,' 'a new anathema maranatha,' 'abomination,'\r\n'paragon and masterpiece of ingratitude,' 'abortive for all good,'\r\n'shocking to the moral sense,' 'the very Koh-i-noor of blackness,'\r\n'essential uncleanliness,' 'disgusting ordure,' 'loathsome stench;'\r\nand the men who support it, if they pass it, will be 'Harpies,'\r\n'Pontius Pilate, with Judas Iscariot on his back.'\r\n\r\n\"The Senator from Massachusetts makes several points against this\r\nproposition, to which my answer is the same. His first point is, that\r\nit recognizes 'the idea of inequality of rights founded on race or\r\ncolor.' I deny _in toto_ the correctness, or even the plausibility, to\r\na man of sense, any point that he has raised on the subject. There is\r\nnot one of them that is tenable; and more than that, there is not one\r\nof them but what is just as tenable against the proposition he is in\r\nfavor of to found representation on voters as this. What lawyer in the\r\nworld ever heard that a denial is an admission? What lawyer ever heard\r\nthat a penalty is a permission? By this proposition, we say simply\r\nthis: 'If, in the exercise of the power that you have under the\r\nConstitution, you make an inequality of rights, then you are to suffer\r\nsuch and such consequences.' What sane man could ever pretend that\r\nthat was saying, 'Make an inequality of rights and we will sanction\r\nit?' We do not deny--nobody can deny--that the power may be thus\r\nexercised. What we say by this amendment is, 'If you attempt to\r\nexercise it in this wrongful way, you create an inequality of rights;\r\nand if you do create an inequality of rights'--not we, but you--'if\r\nyou undertake to do it under the power which exists in the\r\nConstitution, then the consequence follows that you are punished by a\r\nloss of representation.' That is all that is in it.\"\r\n\r\nHaving replied to the most of Mr. Sumner's objections in order, Mr.\r\nFessenden said: \"The last point of the Senator is, that this\r\nproposition is 'a compromise of human rights, the most immoral,\r\nindecent, and utterly shameful in our history.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, I stand rebuked, but I do not feel so bad as I might.\r\nThe Committee of Fifteen, the friends and associates of the honorable\r\nSenator, stand rebuked. More than two-thirds of the House of\r\nRepresentatives and a large majority of this body, all the political\r\nfriends and associates of the Senator, stand charged with proposing a\r\ncompromise of human rights the most immoral, indecent, and shameful in\r\nour history! All I can say with regard to that is, that neither on its\r\nface, in its effect, nor in its intention is it any compromise. None\r\nsuch was dreamed of.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden thus described the remarkable combination of Senators\r\nopposing the amendment: \"I can not close, however, without saying how\r\namusing seems to me the character of the opposition to this joint\r\nresolution. That opposition is composed of men of all shades of\r\nopinion. The Democrats on the other side of the House oppose it\r\nbecause they say it is unjust to the Southern States; my honorable\r\nfriends who have been some time with us are opposed to it because--I\r\ndo not know why, except that the President is opposed to it, and I\r\nbelieve that is the ground; my honorable friend from Massachusetts\r\nobjects because it is unjust to the negro. Why, sir, just imagine all\r\nthe gentlemen opposed to this resolution met in caucus together, and\r\nlooking around at each other, would there not be a smile on all their\r\nfaces to see what company they had fallen into? I think Senators would\r\nbe surprised to find themselves there, and, like the countryman\r\nlooking at the reel in the bottle, they would consider how the devil\r\nthey did get there. [Laughter.] It would be a very strange meeting;\r\nand yet they are all against this proposition.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a running debate between several Senators, the vote was taken\r\nupon the substitute proposed by Mr. Henderson as a constitutional\r\namendment, viz.: \"No State, in prescribing the qualifications\r\nrequisite for electors therein, shall discriminate against any person\r\non account of color or race.\" The amendment was lost--yeas, 10; nays,\r\n37. The question was then taken on Mr. Sumner's substitute, which was\r\nsimply a joint resolution providing 'there shall be no oligarchy,\r\naristocracy, caste, or monopoly invested with peculiar privileges, and\r\nno denial of rights, civil or political, on account of color or race,\r\nanywhere within the United States.\" This resolution was lost--yeas, 8;\r\nnays, 39. The vote was then taken on the amendment proposed by Mr.\r\nYates, providing that no State shall make or enforce any distinction\r\nbetween citizens of the United States on account of race or color, and\r\nthat all citizens shall hereafter be protected in the exercise of all\r\ncivil and political rights, including the right of suffrage. This\r\namendment was lost--yeas, 7; nays, 38. The vote was then taken upon\r\nthe original amendment as reported by the joint Committee of Fifteen.\r\nThe following was the result:\r\n\r\n     YEAS--Messrs. Anthony, Chandler, Clark, Conness, Cragin,\r\n     Creswell, Fessenden, Foster, Grimes, Harris, Howe, Kirkwood,\r\n     Lane of Indiana, McDougall, Morgan, Morrill, Nye, Poland,\r\n     Ramsey, Sherman, Sprague, Trumbull, Wade, Williams, and\r\n     Wilson--25.\r\n\r\n     NAYS--Messrs. Brown, Buckalew, Cowan, Davis, Dixon,\r\n     Doolittle, Guthrie, Henderson, Hendricks, Johnson, Lane of\r\n     Kansas, Nesmith, Norton, Pomeroy, Riddle, Saulsbury,\r\n     Stewart, Stockton, Sumner, Van Winkle, Willey, and\r\n     Yates--22.\r\n\r\n     ABSENT--Messrs. Foot, Howard, and Wright--3.\r\n\r\nTwo thirds of the Senators not having voted for the joint resolution,\r\nit was lost. The defeat of the proposed constitutional amendment was\r\naccomplished by the combination of five \"Radical\" Senators with six\r\n\"Conservatives,\" elected as Republicans, whose vote, added to the\r\nregular Democratic strength, prevented its adoption by the required\r\nconstitutional majority of two-thirds.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of constitutional reform, though foiled in this attempt,\r\nwere not disheartened. Their defeat taught them the important lesson\r\nthat pet measures and favorite theories must be abandoned or modified\r\nin order to secure the adoption of some constitutional amendment to\r\nobviate difficulties of which all felt and acknowledged the existence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other measures, designed to lead to the great end of\r\nreconstruction, were demanding and receiving the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION OF THE SOUTHERN STATES.\r\n\r\n     Concurrent Resolution -- A \"Venomous Fight\" -- Passage in\r\n     the House -- The Resolution in the Senate -- \"A Political\r\n     Wrangle\" Deprecated -- Importance of the Question -- \"A\r\n     Straw in a Storm\" -- Policy of the President -- Conversation\r\n     between two Senators -- Mr. Nye's Advice to Rebels -- \"A\r\n     Dangerous Power\" -- \"Was Mr. Wade once a Secessionist?\" --\r\n     Garrett Davis' Programme for the President -- \"Useless yet\r\n     Mischievous\" -- The Great Question Settled.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was understood when the Committee of Fifteen introduced the joint\r\nresolution proposing a constitutional amendment relating to the basis\r\nof representation, that this was only one of a series of measures\r\nwhich they thought essential to the work of reconstruction, and which\r\nthey designed to propose at a proper time.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this plan, on the 20th of February, the day after the\r\nveto of the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, and while the amendment of the\r\nbasis of reconstruction was pending in the Senate, Mr. Stevens brought\r\nbefore the House, from the Committee of Fifteen, a \"Concurrent\r\nResolution concerning the Insurrectionary States,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it resolved by the House of Representatives_, (the\r\n     Senate concurring,) That in order to close agitation upon a\r\n     question which seems likely to disturb the action of the\r\n     Government, as well as to quiet the uncertainty which is\r\n     agitating the minds of the people of the eleven States which\r\n     have been declared to be in insurrection, no Senator or\r\n     Representative shall be admitted into either branch of\r\n     Congress from any of said States until Congress shall have\r\n     declared such State entitled to such representation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the reading of this resolution, Mr. Grider, of Kentucky, a\r\nmember of the Committee of Fifteen, offered the following minority\r\nreport:\r\n\r\n     \"The minority of the Committee on Reconstruction, on the\r\n     part of the House, beg leave to report that said committee\r\n     have directed an inquiry to be made as to the condition and\r\n     loyalty of the State of Tennessee. There has been a large\r\n     amount of evidence taken, some part of it conducing to show\r\n     that at some localities occasionally there have been some\r\n     irregularities and temporary disaffection; yet the main\r\n     direction and weight of the testimony are ample and\r\n     conclusive to show that the great body of the people in said\r\n     State are not only loyal and willing, but anxious, to have\r\n     and maintain amicable, sincere, and patriotic relations with\r\n     the General Government. Such being the state of the facts,\r\n     and inasmuch as under the census of 1860 Congress passed a\r\n     law which was approved in 1863, fixing the ratio and\r\n     apportioning to Tennessee and all the other States\r\n     representation; and inasmuch as Tennessee, disavowing\r\n     insurrectionary purposes or disloyalty, has, under the laws\r\n     and organic law of said State, regularly elected her members\r\n     and Senators to the Congress of the United States, in\r\n     conformity to the laws and Constitution of the United\r\n     States, and said members are here asking admission; and\r\n     inasmuch as the House by the Constitution is the 'judge of\r\n     the election, returns, and qualification of its members,'\r\n     considering these facts and principles, we offer the\r\n     following resolution, to-wit:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the State of Tennessee is entitled to\r\n     representation in the Thirty-ninth Congress, and the\r\n     Representatives elected from and by said State are hereby\r\n     admitted to take their seats therein upon being qualified by\r\n     oath according to law.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens then said: \"Having heard an ingenious speech upon that\r\nside of the question, and not intending to make any speech upon this\r\nside, as I hope our friends all understand a question which has\r\nagitated not this body only, but other portions of the community, I\r\npropose to ask for the question. I think I may say without\r\nimpropriety, that until yesterday there was an earnest investigation\r\ninto the condition of Tennessee, to see whether by act of Congress we\r\ncould admit that State to a condition of representation here, and\r\nadmit its members to seats here; but since yesterday there has arisen\r\na state of things which the committee deem puts it out of their power\r\nto proceed further without surrendering a great principle; without the\r\nloss of all their dignity; without surrendering the rights of this\r\nbody to the usurpation of another power. I call the previous\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nStrenuous efforts were made by the Democratic minority to defeat the\r\nproposed joint resolution by means of \"dilatory motions.\" Repeated\r\nmotions were made to adjourn, to excuse certain members from voting,\r\nand to call the House, on all of which the yeas and nays were called.\r\nThis \"parliamentary tactics\" consumed many hours. The minority seemed\r\nresolved to make the passage of the resolution a question of physical\r\nendurance. In reply to a proposition of Mr. Eldridge, of the minority,\r\nthat they would allow business to proceed if debate should be allowed,\r\nMr. Stevens said: \"It is simply the return of the rebels of 1861. I\r\nsat thirty-eight hours under this kind of a fight once, and I have no\r\nobjections to a little of it now. I am ready to sit for forty hours.\"\r\n\r\nLate in the evening, a member of the minority proposed that the House\r\nshould take a recess for an hour, that the door-keeper might have the\r\nhall fitted up as a dormitory. From indications, he thought such\r\naccommodations would be necessary. At length, Mr. Eldridge said: \"We\r\nknow our weakness and the strength and power of the numbers of the\r\nmajority. We have not had the assistance which we expected from the\r\nother side of the House in our effort to obtain the privilege of\r\ndebating the resolution. We know perfectly well that it has become a\r\nquestion of physical endurance. We know perfectly well that we can not\r\nstand out against the overpowering majority of this House any great\r\nlength of time. We know if the majority will it, the resolution will\r\npass without debate. We have done all we could. We therefore yield to\r\nthat power, and throw the responsibility of this most extraordinary,\r\nthis most revolutionary measure, upon the majority of the House.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Stevens answered: \"The gentlemen accept their situation\r\njust as Jeff. Davis did his--because they can not help it. [Laughter.]\r\nI confess, sir, for so small a number, they have made a most venomous\r\nfight.\"\r\n\r\nThe vote was then taken upon the concurrent resolution, which passed\r\nthe House--yeas, 109; nays, 40.\r\n\r\nThe hopes which had arisen in the minds of the minority that a\r\nconsiderable number of Republicans would permanently separate\r\nthemselves from the party that elected them, and adhere to the policy\r\nand fortunes of the President, were disappointed. The imprudence of\r\nthe President himself, in making his unfortunate speech of the 22d of\r\nFebruary, tended to unite the Republicans in Congress against his\r\npolicy, and render fruitless the efforts of his new Democratic friends\r\nin his favor.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of February, Mr. Fessenden proposed that the pending\r\nconstitutional amendment should give way, to enable the Senate to\r\nconsider the concurrent resolution passed by the House concerning the\r\nrepresentation of the Southern States.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman thought it would be better and wiser to allow this matter\r\nto lie over for a few days. He thought it best not to press this\r\n\"declaration of political opinion\" while the public mind and Senators\r\nthemselves were more or less affected by surrounding circumstances. \"I\r\nthink,\" said he, \"that we ought not to postpone all the important\r\nbusiness now pending in Congress for the purpose of getting into a\r\npolitical wrangle with the President.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden replied: \"The Senator from Ohio says we are getting up a\r\npolitical wrangle with the President of the United States. When the\r\nPresident of the United States tells Congress that it is transcending\r\nits proper limits of authority, that it has nothing to do in the way\r\nof judgment upon the great question of reconstructing the rebel\r\nStates, and Congress assumes to express its own sense upon that\r\nquestion, I think it is hardly a proper term to apply to such a state\r\nof things. I am not aware that there has been any effort anywhere to\r\nget up a political wrangle or engage in a political wrangle with the\r\nPresident. Certainly I have not. No man has ever heard me speak of him\r\nexcept in terms of respect, in my place here and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"I am not sensible myself of any excitement that would prevent my\r\nspeaking upon this question precisely in the style which I deem it\r\ndeserves. I am not carried away by passion. I have reflected, and I am\r\nready to express my opinion upon the great question at issue; and the\r\nSenator will allow me to say that, in my judgment, the sooner the\r\njudgment of Congress is expressed, the better.\r\n\r\n\"He talks about important business to be done by this Congress. Sir,\r\nis there any thing more important than to settle the question whether\r\nthe Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States have\r\nor have not something to say in relation to the condition of the late\r\nConfederate States, and whether it is proper to admit Senators and\r\nRepresentatives from them? If the President is right in his\r\nassumption--for the assumption is a very clear one--that we have\r\nnothing to say, we ought to admit these men at once, if they come here\r\nwith proper credentials, and not keep them waiting outside the door.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman said: \"In my judgment, the events that transpired\r\nyesterday are too fresh in the mind of every Senator not to have had\r\nsome influence upon him, and I think it as well to allow the influence\r\nof those events to pass away. I do not wish now myself, nor do I wish\r\nany Senator here, to reply to what was said yesterday by the President\r\nof the United States. I would prefer that the Senate of the United\r\nStates, the only legislative body which can deliberate fully and\r\nfreely without any limitation on the right of debate, should\r\ndeliberate, reflect, and act calmly after the excitement of the events\r\nof the last two or three days has passed off.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howe, of Wisconsin, remarked: \"If there be passion and excitement\r\nin the country at this present time, I do not hold myself as an\r\nindividual responsible for any share of it; and I am here to say that\r\nif I know myself--and if I do not know myself nobody about me knows\r\nme--I am as competent to consider this particular question to-day as I\r\nwas the day before yesterday or last week, and, so far as my judgment\r\ninforms me, quite as competent to consider it as I expect to be next\r\nweek or the week after. And when the Senator from Ohio asks me to vote\r\nagainst proceeding to the consideration of any measure, either because\r\nI distrust my own fitness to consider it, or distrust the fitness of\r\nmy associates about me, I must respectfully decline, not because I\r\ncare particularly whether we take up this measure to-day or another\r\nday, but because I ask the Senate to vindicate their own course as\r\nindividual men, and to say that they are not to be swept from the seat\r\nof judgment by what is said, or can be said, by the first magistrate\r\nof the nation, or by the lowest and the last magistrate of the\r\nnation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate, by a vote of 26 to 19, agreed to proceed to consider the\r\nconcurrent resolution proposed by the Committee of Fifteen, which had\r\nalready passed the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden advocated the resolution in a speech of considerable\r\nlength. He presented extracts from the President's speech of the day\r\nbefore, in which he had arrayed himself against the right of Congress\r\nto decide whether a rebel State is in condition to be represented.\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden considered the pending resolution as \"transcending in\r\nimportance the question of the amendment of the Constitution, which\r\nhad been under discussion for several days.\" He deemed the resolution\r\nnecessary now, \"in order that Congress may assert distinctly its own\r\nrights and its own powers; in order that there may be no mistake\r\nanywhere, in the mind of the Executive or in the minds of the people\r\nof this country; that Congress, under the circumstances of this case,\r\nwith this attempted limitation of its powers with regard to its own\r\norganization, is prepared to say to the Executive and to the country,\r\nrespectfully but firmly, over this subject they have, and they mean to\r\nexercise, the most full and plenary jurisdiction. We will judge for\r\nourselves, not only upon credentials and the character of men and the\r\nposition of men, but upon the position of the States which sent those\r\nmen here. In other words, to use the language of the President again,\r\nwhen the question is to be decided, whether they obey the\r\nConstitution, whether they have a fitting constitution of their own,\r\nwhether they are loyal, whether they are prepared to obey the laws as\r\na preliminary, as the President says it is, to their admission, we\r\nwill say whether those preliminary requirements have been complied\r\nwith, and not he, and nobody but ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden made an extended argument on the subject of\r\nreconstruction, affirming that while the people of the rebel States\r\nhad not passed from under the jurisdiction of the United States\r\nGovernment, yet having no existence as States with rights in the Union\r\nand rights to representation in Congress. \"My judgment is,\" said he,\r\n\"that we hold the power over the whole subject in our hands, that it\r\nis our duty to hold it in our hands, and to regard it as a matter of\r\nthe most intense interest to the whole people, involving the good of\r\nthe whole people, calling for our most careful consideration, and to\r\nbe adjudged without passion, without temper, without any of that\r\nfeeling which may be supposed to have arisen out of the unexampled\r\nstate of things through which we have passed.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of February, Mr. Sherman addressed the Senate on the\r\npending concurrent resolution. He approved the principle but doubted\r\nthe expediency of now reäffirming it. \"I regard it,\" said he, \"as a\r\nmere straw in a storm, thrown in at an inopportune moment; the mere\r\nassertion of a naked right which has never yet been disputed, and\r\nnever can be successfully; a mere assertion of a right that we have\r\nover and over again asserted. My idea is that the true way to assert\r\nthis power is to exercise it, and that it was only necessary for\r\nCongress to exercise that power in order to meet all these complicated\r\ndifficulties.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman regarded the President's speech as humiliating and\r\nunworthy of his high office. A part of the speech he characterized as\r\n\"the product of resentment, hatched by anger and passion, and hurled,\r\nwithout reflection, at those he believed wished to badger and insult\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman favored the prompt restoration of Tennessee. \"I think our\r\nfirst duty,\" said he, \"is at once to prepare a mode and manner by\r\nwhich she may be admitted into the Union upon such terms and\r\nconditions as will make her way back the way of pleasantness and\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nOf the general question of reconstruction he said: \"If I had any power\r\nin arranging a plan, I would mark the line as broad and deep between\r\nthe loyal people who stood at our side and the rebels who fought\r\nagainst us as between heaven and hell.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you do it?\" asked Mr. Howard.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever loyal men,\" replied Mr. Sherman, \"present a State\r\norganization, complying with such terms and conditions and tests of\r\nloyalty as you may prescribe, and will send here loyal Representatives,\r\nI would admit them; and whenever rebels send or come here, I would\r\nreject them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear the storm,\" said Mr. Sherman, near the conclusion of his\r\nspeech. \"I fear struggles and contentions in these eleven States,\r\nunless there is some mode by which the local power of those States may\r\nbe put in loyal hands, and by which their voices may be heard here in\r\ncouncil and in command, in deliberation and debate, as of old. They\r\nwill come back here shorn of their undue political power, humbled in\r\ntheir pride, with a consciousness that one man bred under free\r\ninstitutions is as good, at least, as a man bred under slave\r\ninstitutions. I want to see the loyal people in the South, if they are\r\nfew, trusted; if they are many, give them power. Prescribe your\r\nconditions, but let them come back into the Union upon such terms as\r\nyou may prescribe. Open the door for them. I hope we may see harmony\r\nrestored in this great Union of ours; that all these States and all\r\nthese Territories may be here in council for the common good, and that\r\nat as speedy a moment as is consistent with the public safety.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon addressed the Senate in opposition to the concurrent\r\nresolution, and in favor of the policy of the President. \"It is my\r\nbelief,\" said he, \"that what is known as the policy of the President\r\nfor the restoration of the late seceded States in this Government is\r\nthe correct policy. I believe it is the only safe policy.\" Having been\r\nrequested to state that policy, Mr. Dixon said: \"It contemplates a\r\ncareful, cautious, discriminating admission of a loyal representation\r\nfrom loyal States and districts in the appropriate House of Congress,\r\nby the separate action of each, every case to be considered by itself\r\nand decided on its own merits. It recognizes the right of every loyal\r\nState and district to be represented by loyal men in Congress. It\r\ndraws the true line of distinction between traitors and true men. It\r\nfurnishes to the States lately in rebellion the strongest possible\r\ninducement to loyalty and fidelity to the Government. It 'makes\r\ntreason odious,' by showing that while the traitor and the rebel are\r\nexcluded from Congress, the loyal and the faithful are cordially\r\nreceived. It recognizes and rewards loyalty wherever it is found, and\r\ndistinguishes, as it ought, between a Horace Maynard and a Jefferson\r\nDavis.\"\r\n\r\nOf the purpose expressed in this resolution to \"close agitation,\" Mr.\r\nDixon said: \"The vast business interests of this country are eagerly\r\nintent on this question. The people of this country are mutually\r\nattracted, the North and the South, and they must sooner or later act\r\ntogether. Whatever Congress may do, this question will not cease to be\r\nagitated. Adjourn, if you see fit, without settling this question;\r\nleave it as it is; admit no member from Tennessee; and when you go\r\nthrough the States next fall which hold their elections for Congress,\r\nsee whether agitation has ceased. Sir, a word of caution may not be\r\nunfit on that subject.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon maintained that the Senate would surrender its independence\r\nby resolving that Senators should not be admitted from rebel States\r\nuntil Congress should have declared them entitled to such\r\nrepresentation. \"Upon the question of credentials,\" said he, \"this\r\nwhole question is before the Senate; and it is for us to consider on\r\nthat question whether the member presenting himself here for admission\r\nis a traitor or whether he is true to his country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" said Mr. Trumbull, \"that in a time of peace the Legislature\r\nof Tennessee is disloyal, and swears allegiance to the Emperor\r\nMaximilian, does the Senator deny the authority of Congress to inquire\r\ninto the character of that Legislature?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" replied Mr. Dixon. \"It is for the Senate, and not for\r\nCongress, to make the inquiry if a Senator from Tennessee in the\r\nsupposed case presents himself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull said: \"He denies the authority of Congress to decide\r\nwhether the constituency is traitorous or loyal!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is another point,\" said Mr. Dixon.\r\n\r\n\"That is the very one I put,\" said Mr. Trumbull. \"If all the members\r\nof the Legislature of Tennessee swear allegiance to the Emperor\r\nMaximilian, and send a Senator here, I want to know if Congress has a\r\nright to inquire into the character of that Legislature?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will answer that by asking another question,\" said Mr. Dixon.\r\n\"Suppose that was the case, that the Emperor Maximilian had entire\r\ncontrol of the State of Tennessee, and a person claiming a right so to\r\ndo should come here and offer himself as a member of the Senate, and\r\nshould be received here; that, in judging of the qualifications,\r\nreturns, and elections of the member, the Senate decided that he was a\r\nSenator, has Congress any thing to do with the question? I ask him if\r\nthe House of Representatives can interfere? Is there an appeal to\r\nCongress or any other tribunal? I ask him if that man is not a Senator\r\nin spite of the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"If,\" replied Mr. Trumbull, \"the Senator means to ask me if the Senate\r\nhas not the physical power to admit any body, elected or not, I admit\r\nthey have the same right to do it that twelve jurymen would have,\r\nagainst the sworn and uncontradicted testimony of a hundred witnesses,\r\nto bring in a verdict directly against the evidence and perjure\r\nthemselves. I suppose we have the physical power to commit perjury\r\nhere, when we have sworn to support the Constitution. We might admit a\r\nman here from Pennsylvania Avenue, elected by nobody, as a member of\r\nthis Senate; but we would commit perjury in doing it, and have no\r\nright to do it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull made an extended reply, which assumed somewhat the form\r\nof a conversation, in which Mr. Dixon and other Senators participated.\r\nMr. Trumbull claimed that it required the concurrent action of both\r\nhouses of Congress to recognize any government in States where\r\nrebellion had overthrown it.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of February, the concurrent resolution still pending, Mr.\r\nNye, of Nevada, advocated its passage. He opposed the present\r\nadmission of any member from the seceding States. \"We are told,\" said\r\nhe, \"by the apologists of these men who are being elected on their\r\nmerits as rebels, to the exclusion of Union men, that 'we must not\r\nexpect too much of them.' I fully accede to this idea. A class that\r\nduring its whole political life has aimed at a monopoly of wealth, a\r\nmonopoly of labor, and a monopoly of political power; that engaged in\r\nthe attempt at revolution in order to establish more fully and to\r\nperpetuate such monopoly; that, failing in this, has become more\r\nbitter by disappointment, should have time; and, sir, I am decidedly\r\nin favor of giving them all the time necessary for the most\r\nsubstantial improvement. I would say to these men, 'Go home! Go back\r\nand labor as industriously to disabuse the minds of your\r\nconstituencies as you labored to mislead and impose upon them. Tell\r\nthem that the Union Government always was and never can be any thing\r\nelse than a just Government. Tell them that the Constitution has\r\nbecome the acknowledged sovereign, and that it presides in both houses\r\nof Congress. Inform them, while you are about it, that the rebel\r\nsympathizers and apologists in the North can do them no good; that\r\nthey are acting as much out of time and propriety now as they did in\r\nthe time of the war, when their encouragement only prolonged the\r\nconflict and added to Southern disaster. You may say to your\r\nconstituencies that the majority in Congress is very tenacious on the\r\nsubject of the Union war debt; that it is determined to keep faith\r\nwith the national creditors; that it is bent on adopting and throwing\r\naround it all the safeguards and precautions possible; and that your\r\nadmission just now, and your alliance with Northern sympathizers,\r\nwould not be propitious in raising the value of our public securities.\r\nWhile you are conferring with your constituents, you may as well\r\nrepeat to them the common political axiom that Representatives are\r\nelected to represent their constituents, and that it is not believed\r\nat the seat of Government that a disloyal constituency would make such\r\na mistake as to send loyal Representatives to Congress. In short, you\r\nmay as well say to your people that, as Congress represents the\r\nloyalty of the nation, South as well as North, and has much important\r\nwork on hand, some of it requiring a two-thirds majority, it is not\r\ndeemed wholly prudent to part with that majority out of mere comity to\r\nmen from whom no assistance could be expected. Finally, by way of\r\nclosing the suggestive instructions, you may give your constituents to\r\nunderstand that, as you went out of Congress rebel end foremost, you\r\nwill not probably get into those vacant seats over yonder except that\r\nyou come back Union end foremost.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stewart, of Nevada, held opinions of the pending question\r\ndifferent from those maintained by his colleague. He thought \"the\r\npower to suspend the right of a State to representation might imply a\r\ndangerous power, and might imply a right to suspend it for any reason\r\nthat Congress might see fit. The power to suspend the right of a State\r\nto be represented might hereafter be a terrible precedent.\" \"There is\r\nno provision in the Constitution,\" said Mr. Stewart, \"conferring such\r\na power upon Congress. No authority of the kind is expressed in that\r\ninstrument, nor can I find any place where it is implied.\" In another\r\nportion of his speech, which was very long, and occupied part of the\r\nsession of the succeeding day, Mr. Stewart remarked: \"In the darkest\r\ntime of the rebellion, I deny that the right to represent Tennessee in\r\nthis hall by those who were loyal ever was for a moment suspended, but\r\ntheir power to obey the law, their power to represent it was prevented\r\nby treason. They were overpowered, and they were denied the right of\r\nrepresentation, not by Congress, not by the Government. This war was\r\nto maintain for them that right which rebellion had sought to take\r\naway from them, and had for a time suspended the harmonious relations\r\nof the State to the General Government; and it will be too much to\r\nadmit that this Government has ever been in such a fix that the people\r\nthereof were really not entitled to the protection of the\r\nConstitution, and because they were denied it this war was brought on,\r\nthis war was prosecuted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson opposed the resolution in a protracted speech in which he\r\nreviewed the entire subject of reconstruction. Of the condition and\r\nrights of the Southern States he said: \"They are as much States as\r\nthey were when the insurrection was inaugurated, and their relation to\r\ntheir sister States, and their consequent relation to the Government\r\nof the United States, is the same relation in which they stood to both\r\nwhen the insurrection was inaugurated. That would seem to follow\r\nlogically as a necessary result, and if that is a necessary result,\r\ndoes it not also follow that they are entitled to representation in\r\nthis chamber? Whether they can present persons who can take their\r\nseats, because they have individually committed crimes against the\r\nUnited States is another question; but I speak now of the right\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson argued that holding secession sentiments a few years ago\r\nwas no evidence of present disloyalty, and cited in proof of this\r\nproposition a newspaper article purporting to give secession\r\nresolutions drawn up by Mr. Wade, and passed at a meeting held at\r\nCleveland in 1859, which was presided over by Joshua E. Giddings.\r\n\r\nThis called forth an answer from Mr. Wade, who said: \"The Senator from\r\nMaryland called me in question for having been present at a meeting\r\nwhich he affirmed was held in Cleveland some seven years ago by\r\npersons called 'Sons of Liberty,' and he alleged that I there\r\nconsented to certain resolutions that were passed which favored the\r\ndoctrine of secession, and that I was chairman of the committee which\r\nreported them. Sir, the charge is a total forgery so far as I am\r\nconcerned. I never was at any such meeting of the Sons of Liberty or\r\nany other sons. I never uttered such a sentiment in my life; I am not\r\none of those who have or have had much association with gentlemen\r\nholding to secession principles. My associations have all been the\r\nother way. During the war that secession made my counsels were against\r\nit. I was for war to the death against the principle of secession,\r\nwhile many other gentlemen in my eye were either participants in or\r\napologists for that sentiment. I am perfectly aware that a war is\r\nmade--and I am willing to meet it anywhere--upon what are called\r\nRadicals of the country, and I am one of them. In olden times I was\r\nhere in the Senate called an Abolitionist, but they have changed the\r\nname since. They have all got to be Abolitionists now, and they have\r\nchanged my name to 'Radical.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, in the history of mankind, so far as I have read or\r\nknow it, there never has been a time when parties were so organized on\r\nradical principles of justice and right. The party with whom I act\r\nappeal to no expediency, to none of your political policies; we dig\r\ndown to the granite of eternal truth, and there we stand, and they who\r\nassail us have to assail the great principles of the Almighty, for our\r\nprinciples are chained to his throne, and are as indestructible as the\r\nAlmighty himself. I want no warfare with any body; but if you will\r\nmake war upon such principles as we have adopted, it is the worse for\r\nyou. You can not prevail.\r\n\r\n\"I have been in these political warfares for a long time; I claim to\r\nbe an old soldier in them. I stood in this Senate when there were not\r\nfive men with me to support me, and then I rose here and told those\r\nwho were inveighing like demons against the principles that they\r\ncalled abolitionism, that I was an Abolitionist. To-day you are all\r\nAbolitionists, not voluntarily, but by compulsion. I have wondered a\r\ngreat deal why men did not learn more about these things than they\r\nseem to do. Our principles are assailed now with just the same\r\nvirulence that they used to be when we were in a small minority. I do\r\nnot hold that they have triumphed thus far because of any superior\r\ncapacity on our part. Certainly not. Why is it, then, that we, from\r\nthe smallest of all beginnings, have conquered the prejudices of the\r\npeople and conquered the predominant party of this country which had\r\nstood completely dominating the whole nation for more than forty\r\nyears? Why is it that we have conquered you, and now are triumphant\r\nhere in this Senate and almost by two-thirds in both branches, with\r\nthe whole nation at our backs? What miracle has wrought this change?\r\nNone other than the great consoling fact that justice, liberty, and\r\nright are destined among the American people to succeed, and the gates\r\nof hell can not prevail against them, although they are trying at this\r\nparticular time very hard to do it.\" [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of March, the last day of the debate, Mr. Cowan first\r\nclaimed the attention of the Senate in a speech two hours in length.\r\nHe argued \"that for any guilty part taken by the people in the late\r\nwar, that the sufferings and losses they endured in that war were the\r\nnatural and sufficient punishment; that after it they remain purged,\r\nand ought to be reädmitted to all their constitutional rights at once.\r\nThat it is due to the dignity of the United States as a great nation,\r\nif she punishes the actual traitors who incited the rebellion, that it\r\nbe done solemnly and according to the strictest form of law, in open\r\ncourts, where the prisoners may have counsel and witnesses, so that\r\nthey may make their defense, if they have any. That according to the\r\nConstitution and laws all the States are still in the Union; that\r\nsecession ordinances could not repeal the one, nor war set aside the\r\nother; that they are neither dead by forfeiture or _felo de se_, but\r\nare now in full and perfect existence, with all their municipal\r\nmachinery in full play. That the proposition of the Committee of\r\nFifteen to amend the Constitution is fundamental and revolutionary,\r\nand destructive of the freedom of the States and the liberties of the\r\npeople; that it is a threat to deprive them of their rights by\r\ncompelling them either to admit negroes to the right of suffrage or to\r\ngive up a share of their representation, which is theirs by law and\r\nthe last amendment to the Constitution. That the resolution now before\r\nus from the same committee is also revolutionary and destructive,\r\nbeing an attempt to suspend the Constitution and laws in regard to\r\nrepresentation in Congress over eleven States of the Union until\r\nCongress shall see fit to restore them. It is a declaration on the\r\npart of the members of the present House and Senate, that having the\r\nmeans of keeping these States from being represented here, they are\r\ngoing to do so as long as they please; that no one of these measures\r\ncan be justified as a punishment for the rebellion; that the\r\nConstitution forbids them as bills of pains and penalties, and as _ex\r\npost facto_ in their character.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Garret Davis, in the course of a speech in opposition to the\r\nresolution, suggested a summary solution of the present difficulties:\r\n\"There is,\" said he, \"a provision in the Constitution which requires\r\nthe President to communicate to the two houses of Congress information\r\nas to the state of the Union, and to recommend to them such measures\r\n\"as he shall deem proper and expedient. What does this necessarily\r\nimpose upon him? He has to ascertain what men compose the two houses\r\nof Congress. It is his right, it is his constitutional function, to\r\nascertain who constitute the two houses of Congress. The members of\r\nthe Senate who are in favor of the admission of the Southern Senators\r\ncould get into a conclave with those Southern Senators any day, and\r\nthey would constitute a majority of the Senate. The President of the\r\nUnited States has the constitutional option--it is his function, it\r\nhis power, it is his right--and I would advise him to exercise it, to\r\nascertain, where there are two different bodies of men both claiming\r\nto be the Senate, which is the true Senate. If the Southern members\r\nand those who are for admitting them to their seats constitute a\r\nmajority of the whole Senate, the President has a right--and, by the\r\nEternal! he ought to exercise that right forthwith, to-morrow, or any\r\nday--to recognize the Opposition in this body and the Southern\r\nmembers, the majority of the whole body, as the true Senate. And then\r\nwhat would become of you gentlemen? Oh, if the lion of the Hermitage,\r\nand that great statesman, the sage of Ashland, were here in the seat\r\nof power, how soon would they settle this question! They would say to,\r\nand they would inspire those to whom they spoke, 'You Southern men are\r\nkept out of your seats by violence, by revolution, against the\r\nConstitution, against right; the Union is dissolved, the Government is\r\nbrought to an end by keeping the Senators from eleven States out of\r\ntheir seats when the Constitution expressly states that every State\r\nshall have two Senators.'\r\n\r\n\"There is no plainer principle of constitutional law than that the\r\nPresident has the right to ascertain and decide what body of men is\r\nthe Senate and what the House of Representatives when there are two\r\nbodies of men claiming to be each. It is his right to do so, and the\r\npeople of America will sustain him in the noble and manly and\r\npatriotic performance of his duty in determining the identity of the\r\ntrue House. It ought to have been done at the beginning of this\r\nsession. When a petty clerk took upon himself to read the list of the\r\nRepresentatives of the people of the United States, and to keep the\r\nRepresentatives of eleven States out of their seats, the Constitution\r\nguaranteeing to them those seats for the benefit of their constituents\r\nand country, that subordinate never ought to have been tolerated for\r\none day in the perpetration of so great an outrage. Whenever Andrew\r\nJohnson chooses to exercise his high function, his constitutional\r\nright of saying to the Southern Senators, 'Get together with the\r\nDemocrats and the Conservatives of the Senate, and if you constitute a\r\nmajority, I will recognize you as the Senate of the United States,'\r\nwhat then will become of you gentlemen? You will quietly come in and\r\nform a part of that Senate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle opposed the passage of the resolution. Referring to the\r\nplan proposed by Mr. Davis, he said: \"If such a thing should\r\nhappen--which God in his mercy, I hope, will always prevent--that the\r\nSenate should be divided, and one portion should go into one room, and\r\nanother into another, each claiming to be the Senate, I suppose the\r\nHouse of Representatives could direct its clerk to go to one body and\r\nnot go to the other, and I do not know but the President of the United\r\nStates would have the power, in case of such a division, to send his\r\nprivate secretary with messages to one body and not send them to the\r\nother. Perhaps that might occur; but it is one of those cases that are\r\nnot to be supposed or to be tolerated.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson advocated the resolution: \"The nation,\" said he, \"is\r\ndivided into two classes; that the one class imperiously demands the\r\nimmediate and unconditional admission into these halls of legislation\r\nof the rebellious States, _rebel end foremost_; that the other class\r\nseeks their admission into Congress, at an early day, _loyal end\r\nforemost_. He would hear, too, the blended voices of unrepentant\r\nrebels and rebel sympathizers and apologists mingling in full chorus,\r\nnot for the restoration of a broken Union, for the unity and\r\nindivisibility of the republic has been assured on bloody fields of\r\nvictory, but for the restoration to these vacant chairs of the\r\n'natural leaders' of the South.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to Mr. Davis' programme for the President's interference\r\nwith the Senate, Mr. Wilson said: \"Sir, there was a time when a\r\nSenator who should have said what we have recently heard on this floor\r\nwould have sunk into his seat under the withering rebuke of his\r\nassociates. No Senator or Representative has a right to tell us what\r\nthe Executive will do. The President acts upon his own responsibility.\r\nWe are Senators, this is the Senate of the United States, and it\r\nbecomes us to maintain the rights and the dignity of the Senate of the\r\nUnited States. The people demand that their Senators and\r\nRepresentatives shall enact the needed measures to restore, at the\r\nearliest possible day, the complete practical relations of the seceded\r\nStates to the National Government, and protect the rights and\r\nliberties of all the people, without regard to color, race, or\r\ndescent.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden, having the resolution in charge, made a second speech,\r\nin which he answered objections which had been urged, and defended the\r\nCommittee of Fifteen against imputations of a disposition to delay the\r\nwork of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nMr. McDougal took occasion to say a few words against the resolution.\r\nHe said: \"I would not dare to vote for this proposition, because I\r\nhave some regard for the great Judge who lives above. The question\r\npending now, as practically useless as it will be as rule, is yet\r\nmischievous. It is in the way of teaching bad precedents, false law,\r\nunsound loyalty. These things are like the worms that eat into the\r\nmajestic oaks which are used to build vessels to ride the sea, and\r\ndecay their strength, so that they fall down and make wrecks of\r\nnavies.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hendricks had moved to amend the resolution by inserting the words\r\n\"inhabitants of\" after the word \"States.\" This amendment was rejected.\r\nThe Senate then proceeded to take the vote on the concurrent\r\nresolution, which was passed--yeas, 29; nays, 18.\r\n\r\nThus the opinion of Congress was established, by a large majority,\r\nthat the two houses should act conjointly upon the whole question of\r\nthe representation of States, and that this question was entirely\r\nindependent, of the Executive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE RECONSTRUCTION AMENDMENT--IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n     A Constitutional Amendment Proposed and Postponed --\r\n     Proposition by Mr. Stewart -- The Reconstruction Amendment\r\n     -- Death of its Predecessor Lamented -- Opposition to the\r\n     Disfranchisement of Rebels -- \"The Unrepentent Thirty-three\"\r\n     -- Nine-tenths Reduced to One-twelfth -- Advice to Congress\r\n     -- The Committee Denounced -- Democratic and Republican\r\n     Policy Compared -- Authority without Power -- A Variety of\r\n     Opinions -- An Earthquake Predicted -- The Joint Resolution\r\n     Passes the House.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the joint resolution proposing a modification of the basis of\r\nrepresentation was the subject of consideration in the Senate, a\r\nconstitutional amendment relating to the rights of citizens was made\r\nthe topic of brief discussion in the House. It had been previously\r\nintroduced and referred to the Committee of Fifteen. From this\r\ncommittee it was reported back by Mr. Bingham. It was proposed in the\r\nfollowing form:\r\n\r\n     \"ARTICLE--. That Congress shall have power to make all laws\r\n     which shall be necessary and proper to secure to the\r\n     citizens of each State all privileges and immunities of\r\n     citizens in the several States, and to all persons in the\r\n     several States equal protection in the rights of life,\r\n     liberty, and property.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition was introduced on the 26th of February, and was\r\ndebated during the sessions of three successive days.\r\n\r\nMany members of the legal profession saw in the final clause a\r\ndangerous centralization of power. It was considered objectionable as\r\nseeming to authorize the General Government to interfere with local\r\nlaws on the subject of property, the legal rights of women, and other\r\nmatters hitherto considered wholly within the domain of State\r\nlegislation; hence the Republican majority unanimously voted to\r\npostpone the amendment until April.\r\n\r\nAfter this postponement, and the failure of the amendment relating to\r\nthe basis of representation to pass the Senate, the subject of\r\nreconstruction was in the hands of the Committee of Fifteen until the\r\n30th of April.\r\n\r\nIndividuals had, from time to time, introduced propositions on the\r\nsubject, which were referred to the appropriate committee. The one\r\nwhich attracted most attention and excited greatest interest was a\r\nproposition in the Senate, by Mr. Stewart, of Nevada. This was in\r\nfavor of a joint resolution providing that each of the States lately\r\nin rebellion shall be recognized as having resumed its relations with\r\nthe Government, and its Representatives shall be admitted to Congress\r\nwhenever it shall have amended its Constitution so as to provide--\r\n\r\n     \"1. There shall be no distinction in civil rights among its\r\n     citizens by reason of race or color or previous condition of\r\n     servitude; 2. That all debts incurred in aid of the\r\n     rebellion shall be repudiated; 3. That all claim for\r\n     compensation for liberated slaves shall be relinquished; and\r\n     4. That the elective franchise be extended to all persons on\r\n     the same terms, irrespective of race, color, or previous\r\n     condition, provided that none be disfranchised who were\r\n     qualified voters in 1860; and that upon these conditions\r\n     being ratified by a majority of the present voting\r\n     population of each State, (including all qualified to vote\r\n     in 1860,) a general amnesty shall be proclaimed as to all\r\n     who engaged in the rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition had peculiar significance, since it emanated from a\r\ngentleman who, though elected as a Republican, had ever since the veto\r\nof the Freedmen's Bureau acted with the Conservatives. Mr. Sumner,\r\n\"with open arms,\" welcomed the Senator from Nevada as \"a new convert\r\nto the necessity of negro suffrage.\" Mr. Wilson was thankful to the\r\nauthor of this proposition for placing the whole question \"on the\r\nbasis of universal liberty, universal justice, universal suffrage, and\r\nuniversal amnesty.\" The resolution was referred to the Committee of\r\nFifteen, with whom Mr. Wilson had no doubt it would receive \"serious\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, Mr. Stevens reported from the Committee of\r\nFifteen a joint resolution providing for the passage of the following\r\namendment to the Constitution:\r\n\r\n     \"ARTICLE--.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 1. \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall\r\n     abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the\r\n     United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of\r\n     life; liberty, or property without due process of law; nor\r\n     deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\r\n     protection of the laws.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the\r\n     several States which may be included within this Union\r\n     according to their respective numbers, counting the whole\r\n     number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not\r\n     taxed. But whenever in any State the elective franchise\r\n     shall be denied to any portion of its male citizens not less\r\n     than twenty-one years of age, or in any way abridged, except\r\n     for participation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of\r\n     representation in such State shall be reduced in the\r\n     proportion which the number of male citizens shall bear to\r\n     the whole number of such male citizens not less than\r\n     twenty-one years of age.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3. Until the 4th day of July, in the year 1870, all\r\n     persons who voluntarily adhered to the late insurrection,\r\n     giving it aid and comfort, shall be excluded from the right\r\n     to vote for Representatives in Congress and for electors for\r\n     President and Vice-President of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4. Neither the United States nor any State shall\r\n     assume or pay any debt or obligation already incurred, or\r\n     which may hereafter be incurred, in aid of insurrection or\r\n     of war against the United States, or any claim for\r\n     compensation for loss of involuntary service or labor.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by\r\n     appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposed amendment to the Constitution was accompanied by two\r\nbills, one of which provided that when any State lately in\r\ninsurrection should have ratified the amendment, its Senators and\r\nRepresentatives, if found duly elected and qualified, should be\r\nadmitted as members of Congress. The other bill declared the high\r\nex-officials of the late Confederacy ineligible to any office under\r\nthe Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe proposed constitutional amendment was by a vote of the House made\r\nthe special order for Tuesday, the 8th of May. On that day Mr. Stevens\r\noccupied the attention of the House with a brief argument in favor of\r\nthe amendment. Referring to the death in the Senate of the amendment\r\npreviously proposed, Mr. Stevens said: \"But it is dead, and unless\r\nthis (less efficient, I admit) shall pass, its death has postponed the\r\nprotection of the colored race perhaps for ages. I confess my\r\nmortification at its defeat. I grieved especially because it almost\r\nclosed the door of hope for the amelioration of the condition of the\r\nfreedmen. But men in pursuit of justice must never despair. Let us\r\nagain try and see whether we can not devise some way to overcome the\r\nunited forces of self-righteous Republicans and unrighteous\r\nCopper-heads. It will not do for those who for thirty years have\r\nfought the beasts at Ephesus to be frightened by the fangs of modern\r\ncatamounts.\"\r\n\r\nOf the present proposition, Mr. Stevens said: \"It is not all that the\r\ncommittee desired. It falls far short of my wishes, but it fulfills my\r\nhopes. I believe it is all that can be obtained in the present state\r\nof public opinion. Not only Congress, but the several States are to be\r\nconsulted. Upon a careful survey of the whole ground, we did not\r\nbelieve that nineteen of the loyal States could be induced to ratify\r\nany proposition more stringent than this.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the section prohibiting rebels from voting until 1870,\r\nMr. Stevens said: \"My only objection to it is that it is too lenient.\r\nHere is the mildest of all punishments ever inflicted on traitors. I\r\nmight not consent to the extreme severity denounced upon them by a\r\nprovisional governor of Tennessee--I mean the late lamented Andrew\r\nJohnson of blessed memory--but I would have increased the severity of\r\nthis section.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine called attention to the fact that most of the persons whom\r\nthe third section of the amendment was designed to disfranchise, had\r\ntheir political rights restored to them by the Amnesty Proclamation,\r\nor had been pardoned by the President.\r\n\r\nMr. Finck opposed the proposition in a speech of which the following\r\nare extracts: \"Stripped of all disguises, this measure is a mere\r\nscheme to deny representation to eleven States; to prevent\r\nindefinitely a complete restoration of the Union, and perpetuate the\r\npower of a sectional and dangerous party.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the whole scheme is revolutionary, and a most shallow pretext\r\nfor an excuse to exclude the vote of eleven States in the next\r\nPresidential election. You can not exact conditions in this way from\r\nany State in the Union; no more from Georgia than from Massachusetts.\r\nThey are each equal States in the Union, held together by the same\r\nConstitution, neither being the superior of the other in their\r\nrelation to the Federal Government as States.\"\r\n\r\nCommenting on the first section, designed to insert a recognition of\r\ncivil rights in the Constitution, Mr. Finck said: \"If it is necessary\r\nto adopt it in order to confer upon Congress power over the matters\r\ncontained in it, then the Civil Rights Bill, which the President\r\nvetoed, was passed without authority, and is clearly unconstitutional.\"\r\n\r\nTo this inference, Mr. Garfield replied: \"I am glad to see this first\r\nsection here, which proposes to hold over every American citizen\r\nwithout regard to color, the protecting shield of law. The gentleman\r\nwho has just taken his seat undertakes to show that because we propose\r\nto vote for this section, we therefore acknowledge that the Civil\r\nRights Bill was unconstitutional. The Civil Rights Bill is now a part\r\nof the law of the land. But every gentleman knows it will cease to be\r\na part of the law whenever the sad moment arrives when that\r\ngentleman's party comes into power. It is precisely for that reason\r\nthat we propose to lift that great and good law above the reach of\r\npolitical strife, beyond the reach of the plots and machinations of\r\nany party, and fix it in the serene sky, in the eternal firmament of\r\nthe Constitution, where no storm of passion can shake it, and no cloud\r\ncan obscure it. For this reason, and not because I believe the Civil\r\nRights Bill unconstitutional, I am glad to see that first section\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Garfield opposed the section disfranchising rebels as \"the only\r\nproposition in this resolution that is not bottomed clearly and\r\nplainly upon principle--principle that will stand the test of\r\ncenturies, and be as true a thousand years hence as it is to-day.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer, while favoring the proposed amendment in all other\r\nparticulars, was opposed to the third section. \"I think,\" said he,\r\n\"that it imperils the whole measure under consideration. What will\r\ncontinue to be the condition of the country if you adopt this feature\r\nof the proposed plan? Continual distraction, continued agitation,\r\ncontinued bickerings, continued opposition to the law, and it will be\r\nwell for the country if a new insurrection shall not spring from its\r\nbosom.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boyer denounced the proposition as \"an ingenious scheme to keep\r\nout the Southern States, and to prevent the restoration of the Union\r\nuntil after the next Presidential election.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kelley, if he \"could have controlled the report of the Committee\r\nof Fifteen, would have proposed to give the right of suffrage to every\r\nloyal man in the country.\" He advocated the amendment, however, in all\r\nits provisions. He especially defended the third section. \"This\r\nmeasure,\" said he, \"does not propose to punish them; on the contrary,\r\nit is an act of amnesty, and proposes, after four years, to reinvest\r\nthem with all their rights, which they do not possess at this time\r\nbecause of their crime.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage of the resolution was next advocated by Mr. Schenck.\r\nReferring to the third section, he denied the principle advanced by\r\nMr. Garfield that there was any thing inconsistent or wrong in making\r\nit an exclusion for a term of years instead of exclusion altogether.\r\n\"If there be any thing in that argument,\" said he, \"in case of crime,\r\nyou must either not sentence a man to the penitentiary at all, or else\r\nincarcerate him for the term of his natural life. Or, to compare it to\r\nanother thing, which perhaps better illustrates the principle\r\ninvolved, when a foreigner arrives upon our shores we should not say\r\nto him, 'At the end of five years, when you have familiarized yourself\r\nwith our institutions, and become attached to them, we will allow you\r\nto become a citizen, and admit you to all the franchises we enjoy,'\r\nbut we should require that he be naturalized the moment he touches our\r\nsoil, or else excluded from the rights of citizenship forever.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Schenck thought the loyal and true people throughout the land were\r\n\"full ready to declare that those who have proved traitors, and have\r\nraised their parricidal hands against the life of the country, who\r\nhave attempted to strike down our Government and destroy its\r\ninstitutions, should be the very last to be trusted to take any share\r\nin preserving, conducting, and carrying on that Government and\r\nmaintaining those institutions.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith opposed the resolution in a speech which, if it added\r\nnothing to the arguments, contributed, by its good humored\r\npersonalities and its harmless extravagancies, to the amusement of the\r\nauditors.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, May 9th, the consideration of the subject was\r\nresumed, and Mr. Broomall addressed the House in favor of the\r\nresolution. He began by counting the votes that would probably be cast\r\nagainst the amendment. \"It would meet the opposition,\" said he, \"of\r\nthe unrepentant thirty-three of this body. It was also to be expected\r\nthat the six Johnsonian new converts to Democracy would oppose and\r\nvote against this measure, commencing with the gentleman from New\r\nYork, [Mr. Raymond,] who, I believe, has the disease in the most\r\nvirulent form, thence down to the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr.\r\nSmith,] who preceded me on this question, and who has the mildest and\r\nmost amiable type of the infection. Upon them, too, arguments are\r\nuseless. There must, then, be thirty-nine votes against the measure,\r\nand I want there to be no more.\"\r\n\r\nTo the objection urged against the third section of the proposed\r\namendment, that it would disfranchise nine-tenths of all the voters of\r\nthe South, Mr. Broomall replied: \"This is a grand mistake. There were\r\nin 1860 one million one hundred and twenty thousand voters in those\r\neleven States. We may take seven hundred and fifty thousand as the\r\nnumber of individuals in the South who rendered aid and comfort to the\r\nenemy, not counting the comparatively few though powerful leaders who\r\nrendered aid and comfort outside of the army. But, sir, we do not\r\npropose to disfranchise even these seven hundred and fifty thousand.\r\nSupposing two hundred and fifty thousand of the rebel army were lost,\r\nwe have five hundred thousand actual voters in the South to be\r\ndisfranchised by this measure, if they come within the meaning of it.\r\nBut do they come within the meaning of this provision? Why, sir, it\r\ndoes not embrace the unwilling conscripts; it does not embrace the men\r\nwho were compelled to serve in the army. It would be fair to say three\r\nhundred thousand of these people belonged to the unwilling class, who\r\nwere forced into the army by rigid conscription laws and the various\r\ncontrivances of the leading rebels. This will leave two hundred\r\nthousand; and I say now it is utterly impossible, in my opinion, that\r\nthe number of people in the South who can be operated upon by this\r\nprovision should exceed two hundred thousand, if, indeed, it should\r\nreach the one half of that number. Is this nine-tenths of the voters\r\nof the South? Why, it is about one in every twelve.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shanklin opposed the amendment as intended \"to disfranchise the\r\npeople of the Southern States who have gone into this rebellion, until\r\nthe party in power could fasten and rivet the chains of oppression for\r\nall time to come, and hedge themselves in power, that they may rule\r\nand control those people at will.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shanklin closed his speech with the following advice to Congress:\r\n\"Discharge your joint Committee on Reconstruction; abolish your\r\nFreedmen's Bureau; repeal your Civil Rights Bill, and admit all the\r\ndelegates from the seceded States to their seats in Congress, who have\r\nbeen elected according to the laws of the country and possess the\r\nconstitutional qualification, and all will be well.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond spoke in favor of the amendment, except the\r\ndisfranchisement clause. He had opposed the Civil Rights Bill on the\r\nground of want of constitutional power in Congress to pass it. He\r\nfavored the first section of this amendment, since it gave the\r\nprevious acts of Congress a constitutional basis.\r\n\r\nIn answer to Mr. Broomall's \"ingenious argument,\" Mr. Raymond said:\r\n\"It seems to me idle to enter into such calculations, which depend on\r\na series of estimates, each one of which can not be any thing more\r\nthan a wild and random guess. I take it that we all know perfectly\r\nwell that the great masses of the Southern people 'voluntarily adhered\r\nto the insurrection;' not at the outset not as being originally in\r\nfavor of it, but during its progress, sooner or later, they\r\nvoluntarily gave in their adhesion to it, and gave it aid and comfort.\r\nThey did not all join the army. They did not go into the field, but\r\nthey did, at different times, from various motives and in various\r\nways, give it aid and comfort. That would exclude the great body of\r\nthe people of those States under this amendment from exercising the\r\nright of suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond asserted that all that was offered to the rebel\r\nlegislatures of the Southern States, in return for the concessions\r\nrequired of them, was \"the right to be represented on this floor,\r\nprovided they will also consent not to vote for the men who are to\r\nrepresent them! The very price by which we seek to induce their assent\r\nto these amendments we snatch away from their hands the moment that\r\nassent is secured. Is there any man here who can so far delude himself\r\nas to suppose for a moment that the people of the Southern States will\r\naccede to any such scheme as this? There is not one chance in ten\r\nthousand of their doing it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKee advocated the amendment. He thought that opposition to its\r\nthird section was a rebuke to those States which had passed laws\r\ndisfranchising rebels. To obviate all objections to this section,\r\nhowever, he proposed a substitute forever excluding \"all persons who\r\nvoluntarily adhered to the late insurrection\" from holding \"any office\r\nunder the Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Eldridge did not intend \"to make an argument on the merits of the\r\njoint resolution.\" His remarks were mostly in derogation of the\r\ncommittee by whom the measure was recommended. \"The committee,\" said\r\nhe, \"report no facts whatever, and give us no conclusion. They simply\r\nreport amendments to the Constitution. Was that the purpose for which\r\nthe committee was organized? Was it to change the fundamental law of\r\nthe land under which we of the loyal States assembled here? Was that\r\nthe duty with which the committee was charged? Were they to inquire\r\nand report an entire change of the fundamental law of the nation which\r\nwould destroy the States and create an empire? I say they were charged\r\nwith no such duty. The resolution can not fairly be construed as\r\ngiving to the committee any such power, any such jurisdiction. The\r\ncommittee stands resisting the restoration of this Union, and I hope\r\nthat no further business will be referred to it. It has rendered\r\nitself unworthy of the high duty with which it was charged.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Eldridge asserted: \"The whole scheme is in the interest of party\r\nalone, to preserve and perpetuate the party idea of this Republican\r\ndisunion party.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate thus entering \"the domain of partisan controversy,\" Mr.\r\nBoutwell, in a speech which followed, undertook to show how the\r\nproposition before the House \"traverses the policy of the Democratic\r\nparty with reference to the reconstruction of the Government.\" Mr.\r\nBoutwell described the policy of the Democratic party, \"which,\" said\r\nhe, \"they laid down as early as 1856 in the platform made at\r\nCincinnati, wherein they declared substantially that it was the right\r\nof a Territory to be admitted into this Union with such institutions\r\nas it chose to establish, not even by implication admitting that the\r\nrepresentatives of the existing Government had any right to canvass\r\nthose institutions, or to consider the right of the Territory to be\r\nrecognized as a State.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, from that doctrine, which probably had its origin in the\r\nresolutions of 1798, the whole of their policy to this day has\r\nlegitimately followed. First, we saw its results in the doctrine of\r\nMr. Buchanan, announced in 1860, that, while the Constitution did not\r\nprovide for or authorize the secession of a State from this Union,\r\nthere was no power in the existing Government to compel a State to\r\nremain in the Union against its own judgment. Following that doctrine,\r\nthey come legitimately to the conclusion of to-day, in which they are\r\nsupported, as I understand, by the President of the United States upon\r\nthe one side, and, as I know, by the testimony of Alexander H.\r\nStephens, late Vice-President of the so-called Confederacy, upon the\r\nother. That doctrine, is that these eleven States have to-day, each\r\nfor itself, an existing and unquestionable right of representation in\r\nthe Government of this country, and that it is a continuous right\r\nwhich has not been interrupted by any of the events of the war.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Mr. Boutwell thus defined the position of \"the\r\nUnion party,\" which, he said, \"stands unitedly upon two propositions.\r\nThe first is equality of representation, about which there is no\r\ndifference of opinion. The second is, that there shall be a loyal\r\npeople in each applicant State before any Representative from that\r\nState is admitted in Congress. And there is a third: a vast majority\r\nof the Republican party, soon to be the controlling and entire force\r\nof that party, demand suffrage for our friends, for those who have\r\nstood by us in our days of tribulation. And for myself, with the\r\nright, of course, to change my opinion, I believe in the\r\nConstitutional power of the Government to-day to extend the elective\r\nfranchise to every loyal male citizen of the republic.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spalding favored the amendment, including the third section, to\r\nwhich exception had been taken by some of his friends. He asked, \"Is\r\nit exceptionable? Is it objectionable? If it be so, it is, in my\r\njudgment, for the reason that the duration of the period of incapacity\r\nis not extended more widely. I take my stand here, that it is\r\nnecessary to ingraft into that enduring instrument called the\r\nConstitution of the United States something which shall admonish this\r\nrebellious people, and all who shall come after them, that treason\r\nagainst the Government is odious; that it carries with it some\r\npenalty, some disqualification; and the only one which we seek to\r\nattach by this amendment is a disqualification in voting--not for\r\ntheir State and county and town officers, but for members of Congress,\r\nwho are to be the law-makers, and for the Executive of the United\r\nStates, this disqualification to operate for the short period of four\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Miller advocated all the sections of the proposed amendment except\r\nthe third. Of this he said: \"Though it seems just on its face, I doubt\r\nthe propriety of embodying it with the other amendments, as it may\r\nretard, if not endanger, the ratification of the amendment in regard\r\nto representation, and we can not afford to endanger in any manner a\r\nmatter of such vital importance to the country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Eliot had voted against the former amendment, which was passed by\r\nthe House and rejected by the Senate. The present proposed amendment,\r\nwhile it was not all he could ask, was not open to the objections\r\nwhich then controlled his vote. In advocating the third section, he\r\nsaid: \"It is clear, upon adjudged law, that the States lately in\r\nrebellion, and the inhabitants of those States, by force of the civil\r\nwar, and of the Union triumph in that war, so far have lost their\r\nrights to take part in the Government of the Union that some action on\r\nthe part of Congress is required to restore those rights. Pardon and\r\namnesty given by the President can not restore them. Those men can not\r\nvote for President or for Representatives in Congress until, in some\r\nway, Congress has so acted as to restore their power. The question,\r\nthen, is very simple: Shall national power be at once conferred on\r\nthose who have striven, by all means open to them, to destroy the\r\nnation's life? Shall our enemies and the enemies of the Government, as\r\nsoon as they have been defeated in war, help to direct and to control\r\nthe public policy of the Government--and that, too, while those men,\r\nhostile themselves, keep from all exercise of political power the only\r\ntrue and loyal friends whom we have had, during these four years of\r\nwar, within these Southern States?\"\r\n\r\nIt had been argued against the third section that it could not be\r\nenforced, that it would be inoperative. To this objection Mr.\r\nShellabarger replied: \"It will not require standing armies. You can\r\nhave registry laws. Upon this registry list you may place the names of\r\nmen who are to be disqualified, and you may also have the names of all\r\nwho are qualified to vote under the law. There they will stand, there\r\nthey will be, to be referred to by your Government in the execution of\r\nits laws. And when it comes to this House or to the Senate to\r\ndetermine whether a man is duly elected, you can resort to the\r\nordinary process applicable to a trial in a contested election case in\r\neither body, as to whether he has been elected by the men who were\r\nentitled to elect him.\"\r\n\r\nThursday, May 10th, was the last day of this discussion in the House.\r\nMr. Randall first took the floor and spoke in opposition to the joint\r\nresolution. To the friends of the measure he said: \"It is intended to\r\nsecure what you most wish: an entire disagreement to the whole scheme\r\nby the eleven Southern States, and a continued omission of\r\nrepresentation on this floor.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Strouse, in opposing the amendment, occupied most of his time in\r\nreading an editorial from the New York Times, which he characterized\r\nas \"sound, patriotic, statesmanlike, and just.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Strouse expressed, as his own opinion, \"that the States are, and\r\nnever ceased to be, in law and in fact, constituent parts of our\r\nUnion. If I am correct in this opinion, what necessity exists for\r\nthese amendments of the Constitution? Let the States be represented in\r\nthe Senate and House by men who can conscientiously qualify as\r\nmembers; and after that, when we have a full Congress, with the whole\r\ncountry represented, let any amendment that may be required be\r\nproposed, and let those most interested have an opportunity to\r\nparticipate in the debates and deliberations of matters of so much\r\nmoment to every citizen.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Banks regarded the pending amendment as the most important\r\nquestion which could be presented to the House or to the country. \"It\r\nis my belief,\" said he, \"that reörganization of governments in the\r\ninsurgent States can be secured only by measures which will work a\r\nchange in the basis of political society. Any thing that leaves the\r\nbasis of political society in the Southern States untouched, leaves\r\nthe enemy in condition to renew the war at his pleasure, and gives him\r\nabsolute power to destroy the Government whenever he chooses.\r\n\r\n\"There are two methods by which the change I propose can be made: one\r\nby extending the elective franchise to the negro, the other by\r\nrestrictions upon the political power of those heretofore invested\r\nwith the elective franchise--a part of whom are loyal and a part of\r\nwhom are disloyal, a part of whom are friends and a part of whom are\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt that the Government of the United States has\r\nauthority to extend the elective franchise to the colored population\r\nof the insurgent States, but I do not think it has the power. The\r\ndistinction I make between authority and power is this: We have, in\r\nthe nature of our Government, the right to do it; but the public\r\nopinion of the country is such at this precise moment as to make it\r\nimpossible we should do it. The situation of opinion in these States\r\ncompels us to look to other means to protect the Government against\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\n\"I approve of the proposition which disfranchises the enemies of the\r\ncountry. I think it right in principle. I think it necessary at this\r\ntime. If I had any opinion to express, I should say to the gentlemen\r\nof the House that it is impossible to organize a government in the\r\ninsurgent States, and have the enemies of the country in possession of\r\npolitical power, in whole or in part, in local governments or in\r\nrepresentation here.\r\n\r\n\"An enemy to the Government, a man who avows himself an enemy of its\r\npolicy and measures, who has made war against the Government, would\r\nnot seem to have any absolute right to share political power equally\r\nwith other men who have never been otherwise than friends of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\"A pardon does not confer or restore political power. A general act of\r\namnesty differs from an individual pardon only in the fact that it\r\napplies to a class of offenders who can not be individually described.\r\nIt secures immunity from punishment or prosecution by obliterating all\r\nremembrance of the offense; but it confers or restores no one to\r\npolitical power.\r\n\r\n\"There is no justification for the opinion so strongly expressed, that\r\nthis measure will fail because the rebel States will not consent to\r\nthe disfranchisement of any portion of their own people. The\r\nproposition is for the loyal States to determine upon what terms they\r\nwill restore to the Union the insurgent States. It is not necessary\r\nthat they should participate in our deliberations upon this subject,\r\nand wholly without reason that they should have the power to defeat\r\nit. It is a matter of congratulation that they have not this power. We\r\nhave the requisite number of States without them.\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe that there is a State in this Union where at least a\r\nclear majority of the people were not from the beginning opposed to\r\nthe war; and could you remove from the control of public opinion one\r\nor two thousand in each of these States, so as to let up from the\r\nfoundations of political society the mass of common people, you would\r\nhave a population in all these States as loyal and true to the\r\nGovernment as the people of any portion of the East or West.\r\n\r\n\"The people knew that it was the rich man's war and the poor man's\r\nfight. The legislation of the insurgent States exempted, to a great\r\ndegree, the rich men and their sons, on account of the possession of\r\nproperty, while it forced, at the point of the bayonet, and oftentimes\r\nat the cost of life, the masses of the people to maintain their cause.\r\nThere is nothing in the whole war more atrocious than the cruel\r\nmeasures taken by the rebel leaders to force the people who had no\r\ninterest in it, and were averse to sharing its dishonor and peril.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Banks remarked of the amendment: \"It will produce the exact result\r\nwhich we desire: the immediate restoration of the governments of the\r\nStates to the Union, the recognition of the loyal people, and the\r\ndisfranchisement of the implacable and unchangeable public enemies of\r\nthe Union, and the creation of State governments upon the sound and\r\nenduring basis of common interest and common affection.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Eckley advocated the joint resolution, citing a number of\r\nhistorical and political precedents in favor of its provisions. Of the\r\ndisfranchising clause, he said: \"The only objection I have to the\r\nproposition is, that it does not go far enough. I would disfranchise\r\nthem forever. They have no right, founded in justice, to participate\r\nin the administration of the Government or exercise political power.\r\nIf they receive protection in their persons and property, are\r\npermitted to share in the nation's bounties, and live in security\r\nunder the broad ægis of the nation's flag, it is far more than the\r\nnation owes them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Longyear favored the amendment, but disliked the third section, of\r\nwhich he said: \"Let us then reject this dead weight, and not load down\r\ngood provisions, absolutely essential provisions, by this, which,\r\nhowever good in and of itself, can not be enforced. I regard this\r\nprovision, if adopted, both worthless and harmless, and, therefore, I\r\nshall vote for the proposed amendment as a whole, whether this be\r\nrejected or retained.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Beaman held a similar opinion. He said: \"We very well know that\r\nsuch a provision would be entirely inoperative, because electors for\r\nPresident and Vice-President can be appointed by the Legislatures,\r\naccording to a practice that has always obtained in South Carolina.\r\nThe provision does not extend to the election of Senators, and,\r\nconsequently, it can operate only to affect the election of members of\r\nthis House, and that only for a period of four years.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers denounced the proposed amendment in emphatic terms. He\r\nsaid: \"The first section of this programme of disunion is the most\r\ndangerous to liberty. It saps the foundation of the Government; it\r\ndestroys the elementary principles of the States; it consolidates\r\nevery thing into one imperial despotism; it annihilates all the rights\r\nwhich lie at the foundation of the union of the States, and which have\r\ncharacterized this Government and made it prosperous and great during\r\nthe long period of its existence. It will result in a revolution worse\r\nthan that through which we have just passed; it will rock the earth\r\nlike the throes of an earthquake, until its tragedy will summon the\r\ninhabitants of the world to witness its dreadful shock.\r\n\r\n\"In the third section, you undertake,\" said Mr. Rogers, \"to enunciate\r\na doctrine that will, if carried out, disfranchise seven or eight\r\nmillion people, and that will put them in a worse condition than the\r\nserfs of Russia or the downtrodden people of Poland and Hungary, until\r\nthe year 1870.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Farnsworth advocated the amendment, but did not regard the third\r\nsection as of any practical value. It did not provide punishment\r\nadequate to the guilt of the various offenders. \"There is a large\r\nclass of men,\" said he, \"both in the North and South, equally--yea,\r\nand more--guilty than thousands of the misguided men who will be\r\ndisfranchised by this provision, who will not be affected by it. I\r\nallude to those politicians and others at the South, who, keeping\r\nthemselves out of danger, set on the ignorant and brave to fight for\r\nwhat they were told by these rascals were 'their rights;' and to other\r\npoliticians, editors, 'copper-heads' in the North, some of whom were\r\nand are members of Congress, who encouraged them and discouraged our\r\nsoldiers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham spoke in favor of the amendment. He preferred that the\r\ndisfranchising clause should be embodied in an act of Congress. \"I\r\ntrust,\" said he, \"that this amendment, with or without the third\r\nsection, will pass this House, that the day may soon come when\r\nTennessee--loyal Tennessee--loyal in the very heart of the rebellion,\r\nher mountains and plains blasted by the ravages of war and stained\r\nwith the blood of her faithful children fallen in the great struggle\r\nfor the maintenance of the Union, having already conformed her\r\nconstitution and laws to every provision of this amendment, will at\r\nonce, upon its submission by Congress, irrevocably ratify it, and be,\r\nwithout further delay, represented in Congress by her loyal\r\nRepresentatives and Senators.\r\n\r\n\"Let that great example be set by Tennessee, and it will be worth a\r\nhundred thousand votes to the loyal people in the free North. Let this\r\nbe done, and it will be hailed as the harbinger of that day for which\r\nall good men pray, when the fallen pillars of the republic shall be\r\nrestored without violence or the noise of words or the sound of the\r\nhammer, each to its original place in the sacred temple of our\r\nnational liberties, thereby giving assurance to all the world that,\r\nfor the defense of the republic, it was not in vain that a million and\r\na half of men, the very elect of the earth, rushed to arms; that the\r\nrepublic still lives, and will live for evermore, the sanctuary of an\r\ninviolable justice, the refuge of liberty, and the imperishable\r\nmonument of the nation's dead, from the humblest soldier who perished\r\non the march, or went down amid the thunder and tempest of the dread\r\nconflict, up through all the shining roll of heroes and patriots and\r\nmartyrs to the incorruptible and immortal Commander-in-chief, who fell\r\nby an assassin's hand in the capital, and thus died that his country\r\nmight live.\"\r\n\r\nThe hour having arrived when, by understanding of the House, the\r\ndiscussion should close, Mr. Stevens closed the debate with a short\r\nspeech. \"I am glad,\" said he, \"to see great unanimity among the Union\r\nfriends in this House on all the provisions of this joint resolution\r\nexcept the third one. I am not very much gratified to see any division\r\namong our friends on that which I consider the vital proposition of\r\nthem all. Without that, it amounts to nothing. I do not care the snap\r\nof my finger whether it be passed or not if that be stricken out. I\r\nshould be sorry to find that that provision was stricken out, because,\r\nbefore any portion of this can be put into operation, there will be,\r\nif not a Herod, a worse than Herod elsewhere to obstruct our actions.\r\nThat side of the house will be filled with yelling secessionists and\r\nhissing copper-heads. Give us the third section or give us nothing. Do\r\nnot balk us with the pretense of an amendment which throws the Union\r\ninto the hands of the enemy before it becomes consolidated. Do not, I\r\npray you, admit those who have slaughtered half a million of our\r\ncountrymen until their clothes are dried, and until they are reclad. I\r\ndo not wish to sit side by side with men whose garments smell of the\r\nblood of my kindred. Gentlemen seem to forget the scenes that were\r\nenacted here years ago. Many of you were not here. But my friend from\r\nOhio [Mr. Garfield] ought to have kept up his reading enough to have\r\nbeen familiar with the history of those days, when the men that you\r\npropose to admit occupied the other side of the House; when the mighty\r\nToombs, with his shaggy locks, headed a gang who, with shouts of\r\ndefiance on this floor, rendered this a hell of legislation.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir, it was but six years ago when they were here, just before\r\nthey went out to join the armies of Catiline, just before they left\r\nthis hall. Those of you who were here then will remember the scene in\r\nwhich every Southern member, encouraged by their allies, came forth in\r\none yelling body because a speech for freedom was being made here;\r\nwhen weapons were drawn, and Barksdale's bowie-knife gleamed before\r\nour eyes. Would you have these men back again so soon to reënact those\r\nscenes? Wait until I am gone, I pray you. I want not to go through, it\r\nagain. It will be but a short time for my colleague to wait. I hope he\r\nwill not put us to that test.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of his remarks, Mr. Stevens moved the previous question.\r\n\r\nMr. Garfield hoped that it would be voted down, that he might have an\r\nopportunity to offer a substitute for the third section, forever\r\nexcluding the persons therein specified \"from holding any office of\r\ntrust or profit under the Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the previous question was sustained, and a vote was\r\ntaken on the joint resolution proposing the constitutional amendment\r\nas it came from the committee.

The amendment secured two votes which were cast against\r\nthe Civil Rights Bill, while it lost no vote which that measure\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the joint resolution should have been carried\r\nwith such unanimity when so many Republicans had expressed\r\ndissatisfaction with the third section. This is accounted for,\r\nhowever, by the pressure of the previous question, in which fifteen\r\nDemocrats joined forces with the radical Republicans to force the\r\nundivided issue upon the House. A large minority of the Republican\r\nmembers were thus prevented from voting against the clause\r\ndisfranchising the late rebels until 1870.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, as will be seen, the amendment assumed a shape more in\r\naccordance with their wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE RECONSTRUCTION AMENDMENT--IN THE SENATE.\r\n\r\n     Difference between Discussions in the House and in the\r\n     Senate -- Mr. Sumner proposes to postpone -- Mr. Howard\r\n     takes Charge of the Amendment -- Substitutes proposed -- The\r\n     Republicans in Council -- The Disfranchising Clause stricken\r\n     out -- Humorous Account by Mr. Hendricks -- The Pain and\r\n     Penalties of not holding Office -- A Senator's Piety\r\n     appealed to -- Howe vs. Doolittle -- Marketable Principles\r\n     -- Praise of the President -- Mr. Mcdougall's Charity --\r\n     Vote of the Senate -- Concurrence in the House.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution providing for amendments to the Constitution in\r\nrelation to the rights of citizens, the basis of representation, the\r\ndisfranchisement of rebels, and the rejection of the rebel debt,\r\nhaving passed the House of Representatives on the 10th of May, awaited\r\nonly similar action of the Senate to prepare it to go before the\r\nseveral State Legislatures for final consideration. A fortnight had\r\nelapsed before it was taken up by the Senate. That body was much\r\nbehind the House of Representatives in the business of the session.\r\nNotwithstanding the great size of the latter, it was accustomed to\r\ndispatch business with much greater rapidity than the Senate. The hour\r\nrule, limiting the length of speeches, and the previous question\r\nputting a boundary upon debate, being part of the machinery of the\r\nHouse, caused legislation to go on to final completion, which would\r\notherwise have been swallowed up and lost in interminable talk.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, consisting of a smaller number, did not realize the need\r\nof such restrictions. Senators sometimes indulged themselves in\r\nspeeches of such length as, if permitted in the House, would have\r\nproved an insurmountable obstacle to legislation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon. E. O. Morgan, Senator from New York.]\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the discussions in the two houses of Congress was\r\nnever more marked than in connection with the amendment relating to\r\nreconstruction. In this case the members of the House by special rule\r\nlimited themselves to half an hour in the delivery of their speeches,\r\nwhich were consequently marked by great pertinency and condensation.\r\nIn the Senate the speeches were in some instances limited only by the\r\nphysical ability of the speakers to proceed. In one instance--the case\r\nof Garrett Davis--a speech was prolonged four hours, occupying all\r\nthat part of the day devoted to the discussion. The limits of a volume\r\nwould be inadequate for giving more than a mere outline of a\r\ndiscussion conducted upon such principles, and protracted through a\r\nperiod of more than two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution was taken up by the Senate on the 23d of May. Mr.\r\nSumner preferred that the consideration of the question should be\r\ndeferred until the first of July. \"We were able,\" said he, \"to have a\r\nbetter proposition at the end of April than we had at the end of\r\nMarch, and I believe we shall be able to accept a better proposition\r\njust as the weeks proceed. It is one of the greatest questions that\r\nhas ever been presented in the history of our country or of any\r\ncountry. It should be approached carefully and solemnly, and with the\r\nassurance we have before us all the testimony, all the facts, every\r\nthing that by any possibility can shed any light upon it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate proceeded, however, to the consideration of the joint\r\nresolution. Owing to the ill-health of Mr. Fessenden, who, as Chairman\r\nof the joint Committee on Reconstruction, would probably have taken\r\ncharge of the measure, Mr. Howard opened the discussion and conducted\r\nthe resolution in its passage through the Senate. He addressed the\r\nSenate in favor of all the sections of the proposed amendment except\r\nthe third. \"It is due to myself,\" said he, \"to say that I did not\r\nfavor this section of the amendment in the committee. I do not\r\nbelieve, if adopted, it will be of any practical benefit to the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clark offered a substitute for the third section--the\r\ndisfranchising clause--the following amendment, which, with slight\r\nmodifications, was ultimately adopted:\r\n\r\n     \"That no person shall be a Senator or Representative in\r\n     Congress, or permitted to hold any office under the\r\n     Government of the United States, who, having previously\r\n     taken an oath to support the Constitution thereof, shall\r\n     have voluntarily engaged in any insurrection or rebellion\r\n     against the United States, or given aid or comfort thereto.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wade offered a substitute for the whole bill, providing that no\r\nState shall abridge the rights of any person born within the United\r\nStates, and that no class of persons, as to whose right to suffrage\r\ndiscrimination shall be made by any State except on the ground of\r\nintelligence, property, or rebellion, shall be included in the basis\r\nof representation. \"I do not suppose,\" said Mr. Wade, \"that if I had\r\nbeen on the committee I could have drawn up a proposition so good as\r\nthis is that they have brought forward; and yet it seems to me, having\r\nthe benefit of what they have done, that looking it over, reflecting\r\nupon it, seeing all its weak points, if it have any, I could, without\r\nhaving the ability of that committee, suggest amendments that would be\r\nbeneficial.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the third section of the joint resolution, Mr. Wade\r\nremarked: \"I am for excluding those who took any leading part in the\r\nrebellion from exercising any political power here or elsewhere now\r\nand forever; but as that clause does not seem to effect that purpose,\r\nand will probably effect nothing at all, I do not think it is of any\r\nconsequence that it should have a place in the measure.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of May, Mr. Stewart spoke three hours on the\r\nconstitutional amendment. He advocated the extension to the States\r\nlately engaged in rebellion of all civil and political rights on\r\ncondition of their extending impartial suffrage to all their people.\r\nHe announced his policy as that of \"protection for the Union and the\r\nfriends of the Union, and mercy to a fallen foe. Mercy pleaded\r\ngenerous amnesty; justice demanded impartial suffrage. I proposed\r\npardon for the rebels and the ballot for the blacks.\" Of the Committee\r\non Reconstruction, Mr. Stewart said: \"I realize the difficulties which\r\nthey have been called upon to encounter. They have acted a noble part\r\nin their efforts to harmonize conflicting opinions. I rejoice in the\r\nmanner in which the report is presented, and the liberal spirit\r\nmanifested by the committee toward those who are anxious to aid in the\r\nperfection of their plan.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson moved to strike out the third section, without offering a\r\nsubstitute.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman offered a substitute for the second and third sections,\r\napportioning representation according to the number of male citizens\r\nqualified to vote by State laws, and apportioning direct taxes\r\naccording to the value of real and personal property.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional amendment was not again brought up for\r\nconsideration in the Senate until Tuesday, May 29th. The several days\r\nduring which the discussion was suspended in the Senate were not\r\nfruitless in their effect upon the pending measure. The amendment was\r\ncarefully considered by the majority in special meetings, when such\r\namendations and improvements were agreed upon as would harmonize the\r\naction of the Republicans in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe first action of the Senate, when the subject was resumed, was to\r\nvote upon Mr. Johnson's motion to strike out the third section, which\r\nwas passed unanimously--yeas, 43; nays, 0.\r\n\r\nMr. Howard, acting for the committee, then offered a series of\r\namendments to the joint resolution under consideration. The first of\r\nthese provided for the insertion as a part of section one, the\r\nfollowing clause:\r\n\r\n     \"All persons born in the United States, and subject to the\r\n     jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and\r\n     of the States wherein they reside.\"\r\n\r\nAnother modification moved by Mr. Howard was the insertion, in place\r\nof the third section already stricken out, a clause disabling certain\r\nclasses of rebels from holding federal offices. This amendment was\r\nsubstantially the same as that previously proposed by Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to amend section four, which, as passed by the House,\r\nsimply repudiated the rebel debt, by inserting the following clause:\r\n\r\n     \"The obligations of the United States incurred in\r\n     suppressing insurrection, or in defense of the Union, or for\r\n     payment of bounties or pensions incident thereto, shall\r\n     remain inviolate.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the amendments to the pending measure which the majority saw\r\nproper to propose.\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent period of the debate, Mr. Hendricks, in a speech\r\nagainst the joint resolution, gave his view of the manner in which\r\nthese amendments were devised. Being spoken, in good humor, by one\r\nwhom a fellow-Senator once declared to be \"the best-natured man in the\r\nSenate,\" and having, withal, a certain appropriateness to this point,\r\nhis remarks are here presented:\r\n\r\n\"For three days the Senate-chamber was silent, but the discussions\r\nwere transferred to another room of the Capitol, with closed doors and\r\ndarkened windows, where party leaders might safely contend for a\r\npolitical and party policy. When Senators returned to their seats, I\r\nwas curious to observe who had won and who lost in the party lottery.\r\nThe dark brow of the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Clark] was\r\nlighted with a gleam of pleasure. His proposed substitute for the\r\nthird section was the marked feature of the measure. But upon the\r\nlofty brow of the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Stewart] there rested a\r\ncloud of disappointment and grief. His bantling, which he had named\r\nuniversal amnesty and universal suffrage, which he had so often\r\ndressed and undressed in the presence of the Senate, the darling\r\noffspring of his brain, was dead; it had died in the caucus; and it\r\nwas left to the sad Senator only to hope that it might not be his\r\nlast. Upon the serene countenance of the Senator from Maine, the\r\nChairman of the Fifteen, there rested the composure of the highest\r\nsatisfaction; a plausible political platform had been devised, and\r\nthere was yet hope for his party.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of May, the Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,\r\nproceeded in the consideration of the constitutional amendment. The\r\nseveral clauses were taken up separately and in order.\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle was desirous of amending the first section, relating to\r\nthe rights of citizens, by inserting a clause excepting from its\r\noperation \"Indians not taxed.\" His proposition was rejected.\r\n\r\n\"The Committee of Fifteen,\" said Mr. Doolittle, referring to the Civil\r\nRights Bill, \"fearing that this declaration by Congress was without\r\nvalidity unless a constitutional amendment should be brought forward\r\nto enforce it, have thought proper to report this amendment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to say to the honorable Senator,\" Mr. Fessenden replied, \"that\r\nhe is drawing entirely upon his imagination. There is not one word of\r\ncorrectness in all that he is saying; not a particle; not a scintilla;\r\nnot the beginning of truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe first and second sections of the amendment were accepted in\r\nCommittee of the Whole, with little further attempt at alteration.\r\n\r\nThe third section, cutting off late Confederate officials from\r\neligibility to Federal offices, provoked repeated attempts to modify\r\nand emasculate it. Among them was a motion by Mr. Saulsbury to amend\r\nthe final clause by adding that the President, by the exercise of the\r\npardoning power, may remove the disability.\r\n\r\nIt augured the final success of the entire amendment in the Senate,\r\nthat the numerous propositions to amend, made by those unfavorable to\r\nthe measure, were voted down by majorities of more than three-fourths.\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle, speaking in opposition to the third section, said that\r\nit was putting a new punishment upon all persons embraced within its\r\nprovisions. \"If,\" said he, \"by a constitutional amendment, you impose\r\na new punishment upon offenders who are guilty of crime already, you\r\nwipe out the old punishment as to them. Now, I do not propose to wipe\r\nout the penalties that these men have incurred by their treason\r\nagainst the Government. I would punish a sufficient number of them to\r\nmake treason odious.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many would you like to hang?\" asked Mr. Nye.\r\n\r\n\"You stated the other day that five or six would be enough to hang,\"\r\nreplied Mr. Doolittle.\r\n\r\n\"Do you acquiesce in that?\" asked Mr. Nye.\r\n\r\n\"I think I ought to be satisfied,\" replied Mr. Doolittle, \"if you are\r\nsatisfied with five or six.\r\n\r\n\"The insertion of this section,\" said Mr. Doolittle, continuing his\r\nremarks, \"tends to prevent the adoption of the amendment by a\r\nsufficient number of States to ratify it. What States to be affected\r\nby this amendment will ratify it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four will accept that part of it,\" said Mr. James H. Lane.\r\n\r\n\"What four?\" asked Mr. Doolittle.\r\n\r\n\"Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana,\" replied Mr. Lane. \"I\r\nsaw some gentlemen on Monday from Tennessee, who told me that this\r\nparticular clause would be the most popular thing that could be\r\ntendered. And the very men that you want to hang ought to accept it\r\njoyfully in lieu of their hanging.\" [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n\"I do not know who those particular gentlemen were,\" said Mr.\r\nDoolittle. \"Were they the gentlemen that deserved hanging or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were Conservatives from Tennessee,\" replied Mr. Lane.\r\n\r\n\"I deem this section as the adoption of a new punishment as to the\r\npersons who are embraced within its provisions,\" said Mr. Doolittle.\r\n\r\n\"They seem to have peculiar notions in Wisconsin in regard to\r\nofficers,\" said Mr. Trumbull; \"and the Senator who has just taken his\r\nseat regards it as a punishment that a man can not hold an office.\r\nWhy, sir, how many suffering people there must be in this land! He\r\nsays this is a bill of pains and penalties because certain persons can\r\nnot hold office; and he even seems to think it would be preferable, in\r\nsome instances, to be hanged. He wants to know of the Senator from\r\nOhio if such persons are to be excepted. This clause, I suppose, will\r\nnot embrace those who are to be hanged. When hung, they will cease to\r\nsuffer the pains and penalties of being kept out of office.\r\n\r\n\"Who ever heard of such a proposition as that laid down by the Senator\r\nfrom Wisconsin, that a bill excluding men from office is a bill of\r\npains, and penalties, and punishment? The Constitution of the United\r\nStates declares that no one but a native born citizen of the United\r\nStates shall be President of the United States. Does, then, every\r\nperson living in this land who does not happen to have been born\r\nwithin its jurisdiction undergo pains, and penalties, and punishment\r\nall his life because by the Constitution he is ineligible to the\r\nPresidency? This is the Senator's position.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Willey spoke in favor of the pending clause of the joint\r\nresolution. \"I hope,\" said he, \"that we shall hear no more outcry\r\nabout the injustice, the inhumanity, and the want of Christian spirit\r\nin thus incorporating into our Constitution precautionary measures\r\nthat will forever prohibit these unfaithful men from again having any\r\npart in the Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"The honorable Senator,\" remarked Mr. Davis in reply, \"is a professor\r\nof the Christian religion, a follower of the lowly and humble\r\nRedeemer; but it seems to me that he forgot all the spirit of his\r\nChristian charity and faith in the tenor of the remarks which he\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\n\"This cry for blood and vengeance,\" exclaimed Mr. Saulsbury, \"can not\r\nlast forever. The eternal God who sits above, whose essence is love,\r\nand whose chief attribute is mercy, says to all his creatures, whether\r\nin the open daylight or in the silent hours of the night, 'Be\r\ncharitable; be merciful.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle proposed two amendments to section three: the first to\r\nlimit its application to those who \"_voluntarily_ engaged in\r\nrebellion,\" and the second to except those \"who have duly received\r\namnesty and pardon.\"\r\n\r\nThese propositions were both rejected by large majorities, only ten\r\nSenators voting for them. The third section, as proposed by Mr.\r\nHoward, was then adopted by a vote of thirty against ten.\r\n\r\nThe death of General Scott having been the occasion of an adjournment\r\nof Congress, the consideration of the constitutional amendment was not\r\nresumed until the 4th of June. Mr. Hendricks moved to amend by\r\nincluding in the basis of representation in the Southern States\r\nthree-fifths of the freedmen. Mr. Van Winkle offered an amendment\r\nproviding that no person not excluded from office by the terms of the\r\nthird section shall be liable to any disability or penalty for treason\r\nafter a term of years. Both of these propositions were rejected by the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of June, Mr. Poland, Mr. Stewart, and Mr. Howe addressed\r\nthe Senate in favor of the constitutional amendment. Mr. Poland did\r\nnot expect to be able to say any thing after six months' discussion of\r\nthis subject. He took more hopeful views of the President's\r\ntractability than many others. \"Although these propositions,\" said he,\r\n\"may not, in all respects, correspond with the views of the President,\r\nI believe he will feel it to be his patriotic duty to acquiesce in the\r\nplan proposed, and give his powerful influence and support to procure\r\ntheir adoption.\"\r\n\r\n\"While it is not the plan that I would have adopted,\" said Mr.\r\nStewart, \"still it is the best that I can get, and contains many\r\nexcellent provisions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall vote for the Constitutional amendment,\" said Mr. Howe,\r\n\"regretfully, but not reluctantly. I shall vote for it regretfully,\r\nbecause it does not meet the emergency as I hoped the emergency would\r\nbe met; but I shall not vote for it reluctantly, because it seems to\r\nme just now to be the only way in which the emergency can be met at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nAn issue of some personal interest arose between Mr. Howe and his\r\ncolleague, Mr. Doolittle, which led them somewhat aside from the\r\nregular channel of discussion.\r\n\r\n\"He has been a most fortunate politician,\" said Mr. Howe, \"always to\r\nhappen to have just those convictions which bore the highest price in\r\nthe market.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I ever intended in the slightest degree,\" replied Mr. Doolittle,\r\n\"to swerve in my political action for the sake of offices or the price\r\nof offices in the market, is a statement wholly without foundation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howe had said in substance that in 1848 Mr. Doolittle was acting\r\nwith the Free Democratic party in New York, which was stronger than\r\nthe Democratic party in that State. In 1852, when he left the Free\r\nDemocratic party, and acted with the Democratic party in Wisconsin,\r\nthe Democratic party was in the majority in that State. He did not\r\nleave the Democratic party and join the Republican party in 1854, but\r\nonly in 1856, and then Wisconsin was no longer a Democratic State.\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle, after having given a detailed account of his previous\r\npolitical career, remarked: \"During the last six months, in the State\r\nof Wisconsin, no man has struggled harder than I have struggled to\r\nsave the Union party, to save it to its platform, to save it to its\r\nprinciples, to save it to its supremacy. For six months, from one end\r\nof Wisconsin to the other--ay, from Boston to St. Paul--by every one\r\nof a certain class of newspapers I have been denounced as a traitor to\r\nthe Union party because I saved it from defeat. Sir, it is not the\r\nfirst time in the history of the world that men have turned in to\r\ncrucify their savior.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day, June 6th, Messrs. Hendricks, Sherman, Cowan, and\r\nothers having participated in the discussion, the Senate voted on\r\nanother amendment offered by Mr. Doolittle, apportioning\r\nRepresentatives, after the census of 1870, according to the number of\r\nlegal voters in each State by the laws thereof. This proposition was\r\nrejected--yeas, 7; nays, 31.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of June, Mr. Garrett Davis occupied the entire time devoted\r\nto the constitutional amendment in opposing that measure, denouncing\r\nCongress, and praising the President. \"There is a very great state of\r\nbackwardness,\" said he, \"in both houses of Congress in relation to the\r\ntransaction of the legitimate, proper, and useful portion of the\r\npublic business; but as to the business that is of an illegitimate and\r\nmischievous character, and that is calculated to produce results\r\ndeleterious to the present and the future of the whole country, there\r\nhas been a good deal, much too much, of progress made.\"\r\n\r\nOf President Johnson Mr. Davis said: \"He seems to be the man for the\r\noccasion; and his ability, resources, courage, and patriotism have\r\ndeveloped to meet its great demands. If this ark which holds the\r\nrights and liberties of the American people is to be rescued and\r\nsaved, he will be one of the chief instruments in the great work, and\r\nhis glory and fame will be deathless.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of June, the last day of the discussion, the constitutional\r\namendment was opposed by Messrs. Johnson, McDougall, and Hendricks,\r\nand defended by Messrs. Henderson, Yates, and Howard.\r\n\r\n\"Let us bring back the South,\" said Mr. Johnson, in closing his\r\nremarks, \"so as to enable her to remove the desolation which has gone\r\nthrough her borders, restore her industry, attend to her products,\r\ninstead of keeping her in a state of subjection without the slightest\r\nnecessity. Peace once existing throughout the land, the restoration of\r\nall rights brought about, the Union will be at once in more prosperous\r\nexistence than it ever was; and throughout the tide of time, as I\r\nbelieve, nothing in the future will ever cause us to dream of\r\ndissolution, or of subjecting any part, through the powerful\r\ninstrumentality of any other part, to any dishonoring humiliation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I went down once on the Mississippi,\" remarked Mr. McDougall, \"at the\r\nopening of the war. I met a general of the Confederate army, and I\r\ntook him by the hand and took him to my state-room, on board of my\r\ngun-boat. Said he, 'General,' throwing his arms around me, 'how hard\r\nit is that you and I have to fight.' That was the generosity of a\r\ncombatant. I repeated to him, 'It is hard,' and he and I drank a\r\nbottle of wine or two--just as like as not. [Laughter.] This thing of\r\nbearing malice is one of the wickedest sins that men can bear under\r\ntheir clothes.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the third section, which had encountered great opposition,\r\nas inflicting undue punishment upon prominent rebels, Mr. Henderson\r\nsaid: \"If this provision be all, it will be an act of the most\r\nstupendous mercy that ever mantled the crimes of rebellion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us suppose a case,\" said Mr. Yates. \"Here is a man--Winder, or\r\nDick Turner, or some other notorious character. He has been the cause\r\nof the death of that boy of yours. He has shot at him from behind an\r\nambuscade, or he has starved him to death in the Andersonville prison,\r\nor he has made him lie at Belle Isle, subject to disease and death\r\nfrom the miasma by which he was surrounded. When he is upon trial and\r\nthe question is, 'Sir, are you guilty, or are you not guilty?' and he\r\nraises his blood-stained hands, deep-dyed in innocent and patriotic\r\nblood, the Senator from Pennsylvania rises and says, 'For God's sake!\r\ndo not deprive him of the right to go to the legislature.' The idea is\r\nthat if a man has forfeited his life, it is too great a punishment to\r\ndeprive him of the privilege of holding office.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of radicalism, Mr. Yates remarked: \"My fear is not that this\r\nCongress will be too radical; I am not afraid of this Congress being\r\nshipwrecked upon any proposition of radicalism; but I fear from timid\r\nand cowardly conservatism which will not risk a great people to take\r\ntheir destiny in their own hands, and to settle this great question\r\nupon the principles of equality, justice, and liberality. That is my\r\nfear.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle moved that the several sections of the amendment be\r\nsubmitted to the States as separate articles. This motion was\r\nrejected--yeas, 11; nays, 33.\r\n\r\nThe vote was finally taken upon the adoption of the constitutional\r\namendment as a whole. It passed the Senate by a majority of more than\r\ntwo-thirds, as follows:\r\n\r\n     YEAS--Messrs. Anthony, Chandler, Clark, Conness, Cragin,\r\n     Creswell, Edmunds, Fessenden, Foster, Grimes, Harris,\r\n     Henderson, Howard, Howe, Kirkwood, Lane of Indiana, Lane of\r\n     Kansas, Morgan, Morrill, Nye, Poland, Pomeroy, Ramsey,\r\n     Sherman, Sprague, Stewart, Sumner, Trumbull, Wade, Willey,\r\n     Williams, Wilson, and Yates--33.\r\n\r\n     NAYS--Messrs. Cowan, Davis, Doolittle, Guthrie, Hendricks,\r\n     Johnson, McDougall, Norton, Riddle, Saulsbury, and Van\r\n     Winkle--11.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of June, the joint resolution, having been modified in the\r\nSenate, reäppeared in the House for the concurrence of that branch of\r\nCongress. There was a short discussion of the measure as amended in\r\nthe Senate. Messrs. Rogers, Finck, and Harding spoke against the\r\nresolution, and Messrs. Spalding, Henderson, and Stevens in its favor.\r\n\r\n\"The first proposition,\" said Mr. Rogers, \"was tame in iniquity,\r\ninjustice, and violation of fundamental liberty to the one before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" said Mr. Finck, \"it is an outrage upon the people of those\r\nStates who were compelled to give their aid and assistance in the\r\nrebellion. You propose to inflict upon these people a punishment not\r\nknown to the law in existence at the time any offense may have been\r\ncommitted, but after the offense has been committed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you,\" said Mr. Harding, \"you are preparing for\r\nrevolutions after revolutions. I warn you there will be no peace in\r\nthis country until each State be allowed to control its own citizens.\r\nIf you take that from them, what care I for the splendid machinery of\r\na national government?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens briefly addressed the House before the final vote was\r\ntaken. He had just risen from a sick-bed, and ridden to the Capitol at\r\nthe peril of his life. During the quarter of an hour which he occupied\r\nin speaking, the solemnity was such as is seldom seen in that\r\nassembly. Members left their seats, and gathered closely around the\r\nvenerable man to hear his brave and solemn words. From his youth he\r\nhad hoped to see our institutions freed from every vestige of human\r\noppression, of inequality of rights, of the recognized degradation of\r\nthe poor and the superior caste of the rich. But that bright dream had\r\nvanished. \"I find,\" said he, \"that we shall be obliged to be content\r\nwith patching up the worst portions of the ancient edifice, and\r\nleaving it in many of its parts to be swept through by the tempests,\r\nthe frosts, and the storms of despotism.\"\r\n\r\nIt might be inquired why, with his opinions, he accepted so imperfect\r\na proposition. \"Because,\" said he, \"I live among men, and not among\r\nangels; among men as intelligent, as determined, and as independent as\r\nmyself, who, not agreeing with me, do not choose to yield their\r\nopinions to mine.\" With an enfeebled voice, yet with a courageous air,\r\nhe charged the responsibility for that day's patchwork upon the\r\nExecutive. \"With his cordial assistance,\" said Mr. Stevens, \"the rebel\r\nStates might have been made model republics, and this nation an empire\r\nof universal freedom; but he preferred 'restoration' to\r\n'reconstruction.'\"\r\n\r\nThe question was taken, and the joint resolution passed the House by a\r\nvote of over three-fourths--120 yeas to 32 nays. From the necessary\r\nabsence of many members, the vote was not full, yet the relative\r\nmajority in favor of this measure was greater than in the former vote.\r\n\r\nThe following is the Constitutional Amendment as it passed both Houses\r\nof Congress:\r\n\r\n     \"ARTICLE--.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United\r\n     States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are\r\n     citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they\r\n     reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall\r\n     abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the\r\n     United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of\r\n     life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor\r\n     deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\r\n     protection of the laws.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the\r\n     several States according to their respective numbers,\r\n     counting the whole number of persons in each State,\r\n     excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at\r\n     any election for the choice of electors for President and\r\n     Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in\r\n     Congress, the executive and judicial officers of a State, or\r\n     the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of\r\n     the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years\r\n     of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way\r\n     abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other\r\n     crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced\r\n     in the proportion which the number of such male citizens\r\n     shall bear to the whole number of such male citizens\r\n     twenty-one years of age in such State.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in\r\n     Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or\r\n     hold any office, civil or military, under the United States\r\n     or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath as\r\n     a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States,\r\n     or as a member of any State Legislature, or as an executive\r\n     or judicial officer of any State, to support the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in\r\n     insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or\r\n     comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote\r\n     of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4. The validity of the public debt of the United\r\n     States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for\r\n     payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing\r\n     insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But\r\n     neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay\r\n     any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or\r\n     rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the\r\n     loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts,\r\n     obligations, and claims shall be held illegal and void.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by\r\n     appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\"\r\n\r\nThe President was requested to send the Amendment to the several\r\nStates for ratification.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of June, President Johnson sent a message to Congress\r\ninforming them that the Secretary of State had transmitted to the\r\nGovernors of the several States certified copies of the proposed\r\namendment. \"These steps,\" said the President, \"are to be considered as\r\npurely ministerial, and in no sense whatever committing the Executive\r\nto an approval of the recommendation of the amendment.\" It seemed to\r\nthe President a serious objection to the proposition \"that the joint\r\nresolution was not submitted by the two houses for the approval of the\r\nPresident, and that of the thirty-six States which constitute the\r\nUnion, eleven are excluded from representation.\"\r\n\r\nThe President having no power under the Constitution to veto a joint\r\nresolution submitting a constitutional amendment to the people, this\r\nvoluntary expression of opinion could not have been designed to have\r\nan influence upon the action of Congress. The document could have been\r\ndesigned by its author only as an argument with the State Legislatures\r\nagainst the ratification of the Constitutional Amendment, and as a\r\nnotice to the Southern people that they were badly treated.\r\n\r\nThe President's message was received by Congress without comment, and\r\nreferred to the Committee on Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RECONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n     An important State Paper -- Work of the Committee --\r\n     Difficulty of obtaining information -- Theory of the\r\n     President -- Taxation and Representation -- Disposition and\r\n     doings of the Southern People -- Conclusion of the Committee\r\n     -- Practical Recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of June, the day on which the constitutional amendment\r\npassed the Senate, the report of the joint Committee on Reconstruction\r\nwas presented to Congress. This important State paper had been looked\r\nfor with great interest and no little anxiety by the people in all\r\nparts of the country. It was drawn up with marked ability, and was\r\ndestined to have a most important bearing upon public opinion in\r\nreference to the great subject which, in all its bearings, it brought\r\nto the view of Congress and the country.\r\n\r\nThe committee having had unrivalled opportunities for obtaining\r\ninformation, their conclusions commanded the respect of those who\r\ndiffered from them, and obtained the almost unanimous approval of the\r\nparty which carried the war to a successful close.\r\n\r\nReferring to the nature of the work which was required of them, the\r\ncommittee said:\r\n\r\n     \"Such an investigation, covering so large an extent of\r\n     territory, and involving so many important considerations,\r\n     must necessarily require no trifling labor, and consume a\r\n     very considerable amount of time. It must embrace the\r\n     condition in which those States were left at the close of\r\n     the war; the measures which have been taken toward the\r\n     reörganization of civil government, and the disposition of\r\n     the people toward the United States--in a word, their\r\n     fitness to take an active part in the administration of\r\n     national affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe first step to be taken by the committee, that of obtaining\r\nrequired information, and the difficulties attending it, were thus set\r\nforth:\r\n\r\n     \"A call was made on the President for the information in his\r\n     possession as to what had been done, in order that Congress\r\n     might judge for itself as to the grounds of belief expressed\r\n     by him in the fitness of States recently in rebellion to\r\n     participate fully in the conduct of national affairs. This\r\n     information was not immediately communicated. When the\r\n     response was finally made, some six weeks after your\r\n     committee had been in actual session, it was found that the\r\n     evidence upon which the President seemed to have based his\r\n     suggestions was incomplete and unsatisfactory. Authenticated\r\n     copies of the constitutions and ordinances adopted by the\r\n     conventions in three of the States had been submitted;\r\n     extracts from newspapers furnished scanty information as to\r\n     the action of one other State, and nothing appears to have\r\n     been communicated as to the remainder. There was no evidence\r\n     of the loyalty of those who participated in these\r\n     conventions, and in one State alone was any proposition made\r\n     to submit the action of the convention to the final judgment\r\n     of the people.\r\n\r\n     \"Failing to obtain the desired information, and left to\r\n     grope for light wherever it might be found, your committee\r\n     did not deem it either advisable or safe to adopt, without\r\n     further examination, the suggestions of the President, more\r\n     especially as he had not deemed it expedient to remove the\r\n     military force, to suspend martial law, or to restore the\r\n     writ of habeas corpus, but still thought it necessary to\r\n     exercise over the people of the rebellious States his\r\n     military power and jurisdiction. This conclusion derived\r\n     greater force from the fact, undisputed, that in all those\r\n     States, except Tennessee, and, perhaps, Arkansas, the\r\n     elections which were held for State officers and members of\r\n     Congress had resulted almost universally in the defeat of\r\n     candidates who had been true to the Union, and in the\r\n     election of notorious and unpardoned rebels--men who could\r\n     not take the prescribed oath of office, and who made no\r\n     secret of their hostility to the Government and the people\r\n     of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"Under these circumstances, any thing like hasty action\r\n     would have been as dangerous as it was obviously unwise. It\r\n     appeared to your committee that but one course remained,\r\n     viz.: to investigate carefully and thoroughly the state of\r\n     feeling and opinion existing among the people of these\r\n     States; to ascertain how far their pretended loyalty could\r\n     be relied upon, and thence to infer whether it would be safe\r\n     to admit them at once to a full participation in the\r\n     Government they had fought for four years to destroy. It was\r\n     an equally important inquiry whether their restoration to\r\n     their former relations with the United States should only be\r\n     granted upon certain conditions and guarantees, which would\r\n     effectually secure the nation against a recurrence of evils\r\n     so disastrous as those from which it had escaped at so\r\n     enormous a sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nThe theory of the President, and those who demanded the immediate\r\nadmission of Southern Senators and Representatives, was stated in the\r\nreport to amount to this:\r\n\r\n     \"That, inasmuch as the lately insurgent States had no legal\r\n     right to separate themselves from the Union, they still\r\n     retain their positions as States, and, consequently, the\r\n     people thereof have a right to immediate representation in\r\n     Congress, without the imposition of any conditions whatever;\r\n     and, further, that until such admission, Congress has no\r\n     right to tax them for the support of the Government. It has\r\n     even been contended that, until such admission, all\r\n     legislation affecting their interests is, if not\r\n     unconstitutional, at least unjustifiable and oppressive.\r\n\r\n     \"It is moreover contended that, from the moment when\r\n     rebellion lays down its arms, and actual hostilities cease,\r\n     all political rights of rebellious communities are at once\r\n     restored; that because the people of a State of the Union\r\n     were once an organized community within the Union, they\r\n     necessarily so remain, and their right to be represented in\r\n     Congress at any and all times, and to participate in the\r\n     government of the country under all circumstances, admits of\r\n     neither question nor dispute. If this is indeed true, then\r\n     is the Government of the United States powerless for its own\r\n     protection, and flagrant rebellion, carried to the extreme\r\n     of civil war, is a pastime which any State may play at, not\r\n     only certain that it can lose nothing, in any event, but may\r\n     be the gainer by defeat. If rebellion succeeds, it\r\n     accomplishes its purpose and destroys the Government. If it\r\n     fails, the war has been barren of results, and the battle\r\n     may be fought out in the legislative halls of the country.\r\n     Treason defeated in the field has only to take possession of\r\n     Congress and the Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee in this report asserted:\r\n\r\n     \"It is more than idle, it is a mockery to contend that a\r\n     people who have thrown off their allegiance, destroyed the\r\n     local government which bound their States to the Union as\r\n     members thereof, defied its authority, refused to execute\r\n     its laws, and abrogated every provision which gave them\r\n     political rights within the Union, still retain through all\r\n     the perfect and entire right to resume at their own will and\r\n     pleasure all their privileges within the Union, and\r\n     especially to participate in its government and control the\r\n     conduct of its affairs. To admit such a principle for one\r\n     moment would be to declare that treason is always master and\r\n     loyalty a blunder.\"\r\n\r\nTo a favorite argument of the advocates of immediate restoration of\r\nthe rebel States, the report presented the following reply:\r\n\r\n     \"That taxation should be only with the consent of the\r\n     people, through their own representatives, is a cardinal\r\n     principle of all free governments; but it is not true that\r\n     taxation and representation must go together under all\r\n     circumstances and at every moment of time. The people of the\r\n     District of Columbia and of the Territories are taxed,\r\n     although not represented in Congress. If it be true that the\r\n     people of the so-called Confederate States have no right to\r\n     throw off the authority of the United States, it is equally\r\n     true that they are bound at all times to share the burdens\r\n     of Government. They can not, either legally or equitably,\r\n     refuse to bear their just proportion of these burdens by\r\n     voluntarily abdicating their rights and privileges as States\r\n     of the Union, and refusing to be represented in the councils\r\n     of the nation, much less by rebellion against national\r\n     authority and levying war. To hold that by so doing they\r\n     could escape taxation, would be to offer a premium for\r\n     insurrection--to reward instead of punishing treason.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the important subject of representation, which had occupied much\r\nof the attention of the committee and much of the time of Congress,\r\nthe report held the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"The increase of representation, necessarily resulting from\r\n     the abolition of slavery, was considered the most important\r\n     element in the questions arising out of the changed\r\n     condition of affairs, and the necessity for some fundamental\r\n     action in this regard seemed imperative. It appeared to your\r\n     committee that the rights of these persons, by whom the\r\n     basis of representation had been thus increased, should be\r\n     recognized by the General Government. While slaves they were\r\n     not considered as having any rights, civil or political. It\r\n     did not seem just or proper that all the political\r\n     advantages derived from their becoming free should be\r\n     confined to their former masters, who had fought against the\r\n     Union, and withheld from themselves, who had always been\r\n     loyal. Slavery, by building up a ruling and dominant class,\r\n     had produced a spirit of oligarchy adverse to republican\r\n     institutions, which finally inaugurated civil war. The\r\n     tendency of continuing the domination of such a class, by\r\n     leaving it in the exclusive possession of political power,\r\n     would be to encourage the same spirit and lead to a similar\r\n     result. Doubts were entertained whether Congress had power,\r\n     even under the amended Constitution, to prescribe the\r\n     qualifications of voters in a State, or could act directly\r\n     on the subject. It was doubtful in the opinion of your\r\n     committee whether the States would consent to surrender a\r\n     power they had always exercised, and to which they were\r\n     attached. As the best, not the only method of surmounting\r\n     all difficulty, and as eminently just and proper in itself,\r\n     your committee comes to the conclusion that political power\r\n     should be possessed in all the States exactly in proportion\r\n     as the right of suffrage should be granted without\r\n     distinction of color or race. This, it was thought, would\r\n     leave the whole question with the people of each State,\r\n     holding out to all the advantages of increased political\r\n     power as an inducement to allow all to participate in its\r\n     exercise. Such a proposition would be in its nature gentle\r\n     and persuasive, and would tend, it was hoped, at no distant\r\n     day, to an equal participation of all, without distinction,\r\n     in all the rights and privileges of citizenship, thus\r\n     affording a full and adequate protection to all classes of\r\n     citizens, since we would have, through the ballot-box, the\r\n     power of self-protection.\r\n\r\n     \"Holding these views, your committee prepared an amendment\r\n     to the Constitution to carry out this idea, and submitted\r\n     the same to Congress. Unfortunately, as we think, it did not\r\n     receive the necessary constitutional support in the Senate,\r\n     and, therefore, could not be proposed for adoption by the\r\n     States. The principle involved in that amendment is,\r\n     however, believed to be sound, and your committee have again\r\n     proposed it in another form, hoping that it may receive the\r\n     approbation of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe action of the people of the insurrectionary States, and their\r\nresponses to the President's appeals, as showing their degree of\r\npreparation for immediate admission into Congress, was thus set forth\r\nin the report:\r\n\r\n     \"So far as the disposition of the people of the\r\n     insurrectionary States and the probability of their adopting\r\n     measures conforming to the changed condition of affairs can\r\n     be inferred, from the papers submitted by the President as\r\n     the basis of his action, the prospects are far from\r\n     encouraging. It appears quite clear that the anti-slavery\r\n     amendments, both to the State and Federal Constitutions,\r\n     were adopted with reluctance by the bodies which did adopt\r\n     them; and in some States they have been either passed by in\r\n     silence or rejected. The language of all the provisions and\r\n     ordinances of the States on the subject amounts to nothing\r\n     more than an unwilling admission of an unwelcome truth. As\r\n     to the ordinance of secession, it is in some cases declared\r\n     'null and void,' and in others simply 'repealed,' and in no\r\n     case is a refutation of this deadly heresy considered worthy\r\n     of a place in the new constitutions.\r\n\r\n     \"If, as the President assumes, these insurrectionary States\r\n     were, at the close of the war, wholly without State\r\n     governments, it would seem that before being admitted to\r\n     participate in the direction of public affairs, such\r\n     governments should be regularly organized. Long usage has\r\n     established, and numerous statutes have pointed out, the\r\n     mode in which this should be done. A convention to frame a\r\n     form of government should be assembled under competent\r\n     authority. Ordinarily this authority emanates from Congress;\r\n     but under the peculiar circumstances, your committee is not\r\n     disposed to criticise the President's action in assuming the\r\n     power exercised by him in this regard.\r\n\r\n     \"The convention, when assembled, should frame a constitution\r\n     of government, which should be submitted to the people for\r\n     adoption. If adopted, a Legislature should be convened to\r\n     pass the laws necessary to carry it into effect. When a\r\n     State thus organized claims representation in Congress, the\r\n     election of Representatives should be provided for by law,\r\n     in accordance with the laws of Congress regulating\r\n     representation, and the proof, that the action taken has\r\n     been in conformity to law, should be submitted to Congress.\r\n\r\n     \"In no case have these essential preliminary steps been\r\n     taken. The conventions assembled seem to have assumed that\r\n     the Constitution which had been repudiated and overthrown,\r\n     was still in existence, and operative to constitute the\r\n     States members of the Union, and to have contented\r\n     themselves with such amendments as they were informed were\r\n     requisite in order to insure their return to an immediate\r\n     participation in the Government of the United States. And\r\n     without waiting to ascertain whether the people they\r\n     represented would adopt even the proposed amendments, they\r\n     at once called elections of Representatives to Congress in\r\n     nearly all instances before an Executive had been chosen to\r\n     issue certificates of election under the State laws, and\r\n     such elections as were held were ordered by the conventions.\r\n     In one instance, at least, the writs of election were signed\r\n     by the provisional governor. Glaring irregularities and\r\n     unwarranted assumptions of power are manifest in several\r\n     cases, particularly in South Carolina, where the convention,\r\n     although disbanded by the provisional governor on the ground\r\n     that it was a revolutionary body, assumed to district the\r\n     State.\"\r\n\r\nThe report thus sets forth the conduct naturally expected of the\r\nSouthern people, as contrasted with their actual doings:\r\n\r\n     \"They should exhibit in their acts something more than\r\n     unwilling submission to an unavoidable necessity--a feeling,\r\n     if not cheerful, certainly not offensive and defiant, and\r\n     should evince an entire repudiation of all hostility to the\r\n     General Government by an acceptance of such just and\r\n     favorable conditions as that Government should think the\r\n     public safety demands. Has this been done? Let us look at\r\n     the facts shown by the evidence taken by the committee.\r\n     Hardly had the war closed before the people of these\r\n     insurrectionary States come forward and hastily claim as a\r\n     right the privilege of participating at once in that\r\n     Government which they had for four years been fighting to\r\n     overthrow.\r\n\r\n     \"Allowed and encouraged by the Executive to organize State\r\n     governments, they at once place in power leading rebels,\r\n     unrepentant and unpardoned, excluding with contempt those\r\n     who had manifested an attachment to the Union, and\r\n     preferring, in many instances, those who had rendered\r\n     themselves the most obnoxious. In the face of the law\r\n     requiring an oath which would necessarily exclude all such\r\n     men from Federal office, they elect, with very few\r\n     exceptions, as Senators and Representatives in Congress, men\r\n     who had actively participated in the rebellion, insultingly\r\n     denouncing the law as unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n     \"It is only necessary to instance the election to the Senate\r\n     of the late Vice President of the Confederacy--a man who,\r\n     against his own declared convictions, had lent all the\r\n     weight of his acknowledged ability and of his influence as a\r\n     most prominent public man to the cause of the rebellion, and\r\n     who, unpardoned rebel as he is, with that oath staring him\r\n     in the face, had the assurance to lay his credentials on the\r\n     table of the Senate. Other rebels of scarcely less note or\r\n     notoriety were selected from other quarters. Professing no\r\n     repentance, glorying apparently in the crime they had\r\n     committed, avowing still, as the uncontradicted testimony of\r\n     Mr. Stephens and many others proves, an adherence to the\r\n     pernicious doctrines of secession, and declaring that they\r\n     yielded only to necessity, they insist with unanimous voice\r\n     upon their rights as States, and proclaim they will submit\r\n     to no conditions whatever preliminary to their resumption of\r\n     power under that Constitution which they still claim the\r\n     right to repudiate.\"\r\n\r\nFinally the report thus presented the \"conclusion of the committee:\"\r\n\r\n     \"That the so-called Confederate States are not at present\r\n     entitled to representation in the Congress of the United\r\n     States; that before allowing such representation, adequate\r\n     security for future peace and safety should be required;\r\n     that this can only be found in such changes of the organic\r\n     law as shall determine the civil rights and privileges of\r\n     all citizens in all parts of the republic, shall place\r\n     representation on an equitable basis, shall fix a stigma\r\n     upon treason, and protect the loyal people against future\r\n     claims for the expenses incurred in support of rebellion and\r\n     for manumitted slaves, together with an express grant of\r\n     power in Congress to enforce these provisions. To this end\r\n     they have offered a joint resolution for amending the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, and two several bills\r\n     designed to carry the same into effect.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Constitutional Amendment by more than the necessary\r\nmajority has been related. One of the bills to which reference is made\r\nin the above report--declaring certain officials of the so-called\r\nConfederate States ineligible to any office under the Government of\r\nthe United States--was placed in the amendment in lieu of the\r\ndisfranchising clause. The other bill provided for \"the restoration of\r\nthe States lately in insurrection to their full rights\" so soon as\r\nthey should have ratified the proposed amendment. This bill was\r\ndefeated in the House by a vote of 75 to 48. Congress thus refused to\r\npledge itself in advance to make the amendment the sole test of the\r\nreädmission of rebel States. Congress, however, clearly indicated a\r\ndisposition to restore those States \"at the earliest day consistent\r\nwith the future peace and safety of the Union.\" The report and doings\r\nof the Committee of Fifteen, although by many impatiently criticised\r\nas dilatory, resulted, before the end of the first session of the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress, in the reconstruction of one of the States\r\nlately in rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nRESTORATION OF TENNESSEE.\r\n\r\n     Assembling of the Tennessee Legislature -- Ratification of\r\n     the Constitutional Amendment -- Restoration of Tennessee\r\n     proposed in Congress -- The Government of Tennessee not\r\n     Republican -- Protest against the Preamble -- Passage in the\r\n     House -- New Preamble proposed -- The President's Opinion\r\n     deprecated and disregarded -- Passage in the Senate -- The\r\n     President's Approval and Protest -- Admission of Tennessee\r\n     Members -- Mr. Patterson's Case.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important practical step in the work of reconstruction taken\r\nby the Thirty-ninth Congress was the restoration of Tennessee to her\r\nrelations to the Union. Of all the recently rebellious States,\r\nTennessee was the first to give a favorable response to the overtures\r\nof Congress by ratifying the Constitutional Amendment.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the reception of the circular of the Secretary of State\r\ncontaining the proposed amendment, Governor Brownlow issued a\r\nproclamation summoning the Legislature of Tennessee to assemble at\r\nNashville on the 4th of July.\r\n\r\nThere are eighty-four seats in the lower branch of the Legislature of\r\nTennessee. By the State Constitution, two-thirds of the seats are\r\nrequired to be full to constitute a quorum. The presence of fifty-six\r\nmembers seemed essential for the legal transaction of business. Every\r\neffort was made to prevent the assembling of the required number. The\r\npowerful influence of the President himself was thrown in opposition\r\nto ratification.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the assembling of the Legislature but fifty-two members\r\nvoluntarily appeared. Two additional members were secured by arrest,\r\nso that the number nominally in attendance was fifty-four, and thus it\r\nremained for several days. It was ascertained that deaths and\r\nresignations had reduced the number of actual members to seventy-two,\r\nand a Union caucus determined to declare that fifty-four members\r\nshould constitute a quorum. Two more Union members opportunely\r\narrived, swelling the number present in the Capitol to fifty-six.\r\nNeither persuasion nor compulsion availed to induce the two\r\n\"Conservative members\" to occupy their seats, and the house was driven\r\nto the expedient of considering the members who were under arrest and\r\nconfined in a committee room, as present in their places. This having\r\nbeen decided, the constitutional amendment was immediately ratified.\r\nGovernor Brownlow immediately sent the following telegraphic dispatch\r\nto Washington:\r\n\r\n                    \"NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, _Thursday_, July 19--12 M.\r\n\r\n     \"_To Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War, Washington, D. C._\r\n\r\n     My compliments to the President. We have carried the\r\n     Constitutional Amendment in the House. Vote, 43 to 18; two\r\n     of his tools refusing to vote.\r\n\r\n                                             W. G. BROWNLOW.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of July, the very day on which Tennessee voted to ratify\r\nthe amendment, and immediately after the news was received in\r\nWashington, Mr. Bingham, in the House of Representatives, moved to\r\nreconsider a motion by which a joint resolution relating to the\r\nrestoration of Tennessee had been referred to the Committee on\r\nReconstruction.\r\n\r\nThis joint resolution having been drawn up in the early part of the\r\nsession, was not adapted to the altered condition of affairs resulting\r\nfrom the passage of the constitutional amendment in Congress. The\r\nmotion to reconsider having passed, Mr. Bingham proposed the following\r\nsubstitute:\r\n\r\n     \"Joint resolution declaring Tennessee again entitled to\r\n     Senators and Representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, The State of Tennessee has in good faith ratified\r\n     the article of amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\n     States, proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress to the\r\n     Legislatures of the several States, and has also shown, to\r\n     the satisfaction of Congress, by a proper spirit of\r\n     obedience in the body of her people, her return to her due\r\n     allegiance to the Government, laws, and authority of the\r\n     United States: Therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives\r\n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled_, That\r\n     the State of Tennessee is hereby restored to her former,\r\n     proper, practical relation to the Union, and again entitled\r\n     to be represented by Senators and Representatives in\r\n     Congress, duly elected and qualified, upon their taking the\r\n     oaths of office required by existing laws.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, this joint resolution was the regular order, and\r\ngave rise to a brief discussion.\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell desired to offer an amendment providing that Tennessee\r\nshould have representation in Congress whenever, in addition to having\r\nratified the constitutional amendment, it should establish an \"equal\r\nand just system of suffrage.\" Mr. Boutwell, although opposed to the\r\njoint resolution before the House, had no \"technical\" objections to\r\nthe immediate restoration of Tennessee. \"I am not troubled,\" said he,\r\n\"by the informalities apparent in the proceedings of the Tennessee\r\nLegislature upon the question of ratifying the constitutional\r\namendment. It received the votes of a majority of the members of a\r\nfull house, and when the proper officers shall have made the customary\r\ncertificate, and filed it in the Department of State, it is not easy\r\nto see how any legal objection can be raised, even if two-thirds of\r\nthe members were not present, although that proportion is a quorum\r\naccording to the constitution of the State.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell declared that his objections to the pending measure were\r\nvital and fundamental. The government of Tennessee was not republican\r\nin form, since under its constitution more than eighty thousand male\r\ncitizens were deprived of the right of suffrage. The enfranchisement\r\nof the freedmen of Tennessee should be the beginning of the great work\r\nof reconstruction upon a republican basis. \"We surrender the rights of\r\nfour million people,\" said Mr. Boutwell in concluding his remarks; \"we\r\nsurrender the cause of justice; we imperil the peace and endanger the\r\nprosperity of the country; we degrade ourselves as a great party which\r\nhas controlled the government in the most trying times in the history\r\nof the world.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Higby thought that Tennessee should not be admitted without a\r\nrestriction that she should not be allowed any more representation\r\nthan that to which she would be entitled were the constitutional\r\namendment in full operation and effect.\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham advocated at considerable length the immediate restoration\r\nof Tennessee. \"Inasmuch,\" said he, \"as Tennessee has conformed to all\r\nour requirements; inasmuch as she has, by a majority of her whole\r\nlegislature in each house, ratified the amendment in good faith;\r\ninasmuch as she has of her own voluntary will conformed her\r\nconstitution and laws to the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates; inasmuch as she has by her fundamental law forever prohibited\r\nthe assumption or payment of the rebel debt, or the enslavement of\r\nmen; inasmuch as she has by her own constitution declared that rebels\r\nshall not exercise any of the political power of the State or vote at\r\nelections; and thereby given the American people assurance of her\r\ndetermination to stand by this great measure of security for the\r\nfuture of the Republic, Tennessee is as much entitled to be\r\nrepresented here as any State in the Union.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Finck, Mr. Eldridge, and other Democrats favored the resolution,\r\nwhile they protested against and \"spit on\" the preamble.\r\n\r\nThe question having been taken, the joint resolution passed the House,\r\none hundred and twenty-five voting in the affirmative, and twelve in\r\nthe negative. These last were the following: Messrs. Alley, Benjamin,\r\nBoutwell, Eliot, Higby, Jenckes, Julian, Kelley, Loan, McClurg, Paine,\r\nand Williams.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the passage of the joint resolution was greeted\r\nwith demonstrations of applause on the floor and in the galleries.\r\n\r\nOn the day succeeding this action in the House, the joint resolution\r\ncame up for consideration in the Senate. After a considerable\r\ndiscussion, the resolution as it passed the House was adopted by the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nIn place of the preamble which was passed by the House, Mr. Trumbull\r\nproposed the following substitute:\r\n\r\n     \"_Whereas_, In the year 1861, the government of the State of\r\n     Tennessee was seized upon and taken possession of by persons\r\n     in hostility to the United States, and the inhabitants of\r\n     said State, in pursuance of an act of Congress were declared\r\n     to be in a state of insurrection against the United States;\r\n     and whereas said State government can only be restored to\r\n     its former political relations in the Union by the consent\r\n     of the law-making power of the United States; and whereas\r\n     the people of said State did on the 22d of February, 1865,\r\n     by a large popular vote adopt and ratify a constitution of\r\n     government whereby slavery was abolished, and all ordinances\r\n     and laws of secession and debts contracted under the same\r\n     were declared void; and whereas a State government has been\r\n     organized under said constitution which has ratified the\r\n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States\r\n     abolishing slavery, also the amendment proposed by the\r\n     Thirty-ninth Congress, and has done other acts proclaiming\r\n     and denoting loyalty: Therefore.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman opposed the substitution of this preamble. \"These\r\npolitical dogmas,\" said he, \"can not receive the sanction of the\r\nPresident; and to insert them will only create delay, and postpone the\r\nadmission of Tennessee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pay no regard,\" said Mr. Wade, \"to all that has been said here in\r\nrelation to the President probably vetoing your bill, for any thing he\r\nmay do, in my judgment, is entirely out of order on this floor. Sir,\r\nin olden times it was totally inadmissible in the British Parliament\r\nfor any member to allude to any opinion that the king might entertain\r\non any thing before the body; and much more, sir, ought an American\r\nCongress never to permit any member to allude to the opinion that the\r\nExecutive may have upon any subject under consideration. He has his\r\nduty to perform, and we ours; and we have no right whatever under the\r\nConstitution to be biased by any opinion that he may entertain on any\r\nsubject. Therefore, sir, I believe that it is, or ought to be, out of\r\norder to allude to any such thing here. Let the President do what he\r\nconceives to be his duty, and let us do ours, without being biased in\r\nany way whatever by what it may be supposed he will do.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brown entered his disclaimer. \"Republicanism,\" said he, \"means\r\nnothing if it means not impartial, universal suffrage. Republicanism\r\nis a mockery and a lie if it can assume to administer this government\r\nin the name of freedom, and yet sanction, as this act will, the\r\ndisfranchisement of a large, if not the largest, part of the loyal\r\npopulation of the rebel States on the pretext of color and race.\"\r\n\r\nThe question being taken on the passage of the preamble as substituted\r\nby the Senate, together with the resolution of the House, resulted in\r\ntwenty-eight Senators voting in the affirmative, and four in the\r\nnegative. The latter were Messrs. Brown, Buckalew, McDougal, and\r\nSumner.\r\n\r\nThe House concurred in the amendment of the Senate, without\r\ndiscussion, and the joint resolution went to the President for his\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of July, the President, not thinking it expedient to risk\r\na veto, signed the joint resolution, and at the same time sent to the\r\nHouse his protest against the opinions presented in the preamble.\r\nAfter having given his objections to the preamble and resolution at\r\nconsiderable length, the President said: \"I have, notwithstanding the\r\nanomalous character of this proceeding, affixed my signature to the\r\nresolution. [General applause and laughter.] My approval, however, is\r\nnot to be construed as an acknowledgment of the right of Congress to\r\npass laws preliminary to the admission of duly-qualified\r\nrepresentatives from any of the States. [Great laughter.] Neither is\r\nit to be considered as committing me to all the statements made in the\r\npreamble, [renewed laughter,] some of which are, in my opinion,\r\nwithout foundation in fact, especially the assertion that the State of\r\nTennessee has ratified the amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress.\" [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nAfter the reading of the President's Message, Mr. Stevens said:\r\n\"Inasmuch as the joint resolution has become a law by the entire and\r\ncordial approval of the President, [laughter,] I am joint committee on\r\nreconstruction to ask that that committee be discharged from the\r\nfurther consideration of the credentials of the members elect from the\r\nState of Tennessee, and to move that the same be referred to the\r\nCommittee of Elections of this House.\"\r\n\r\nThis motion was passed. At a later hour of the same day's session, Mr.\r\nDawes, of the Committee on Elections, having permission to report,\r\nsaid that the credentials of the eight Representatives elect from\r\nTennessee had been examined, and were found in conformity with law. He\r\nmoved, therefore, that the gentlemen be sworn in as members of the\r\nHouse from the State of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nHorace Maynard and other gentlemen from Tennessee then went forward\r\namid applause, and took the oath of office.\r\n\r\nOn the day following, Joseph S. Fowler was sworn in, and took his seat\r\nas a Senator from Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Fowler presented the credentials of David T.\r\nPatterson as a Senator elect from Tennessee. A motion was made that\r\nthese credentials be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, with\r\ninstructions to inquire into the qualifications of Mr. Patterson.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances in this case were peculiar. Mr. Patterson had been\r\nelected circuit judge by the people of East Tennessee in 1854. His\r\nterm of office expired in 1862, after Tennessee had passed the\r\nordinance of secession and became a member of the Southern\r\nConfederacy. He was a firm, avowed, and influential Union man, and in\r\nthe exercise of the duties of his office did much to protect the\r\ninterests of loyal men. Persons who were opposed to secession, which\r\nwith lawless violence was sweeping over the State, felt the importance\r\nof having the offices filled by Union men. Mr. Patterson was urged to\r\nagain become a candidate for judge. He reluctantly consented, and was\r\nelected by a large majority over a rebel candidate. Governor Harris\r\nsent his commission, with peremptory orders that he should immediately\r\ntake the oath to support the Southern Confederacy. Judge Patterson\r\ndelayed and hesitated, and consulted other Union men as to the proper\r\ncourse to be pursued. They advised and urged him to take the oath. By\r\nso doing he could afford protection, to some extent, to Union men,\r\nagainst acts of lawless violence on the part of rebels. He was advised\r\nthat, if he did not accept the office, it would be filled by a rebel,\r\nand the people would be oppressed by the civil as well as the military\r\npower of the rebels. He yielded to these arguments and this advice,\r\nand took the oath prescribed by the Legislature, which in substance\r\nwas that he would support the Constitution of Tennessee and the\r\nConstitution of the Confederate States. He declared at the time that\r\nhe owed no allegiance to the Confederate Government, and did not\r\nconsider that part of the oath as binding him at all.\r\n\r\nJudge Patterson held a few terms of court in counties when he could\r\norganize grand juries of Union men, and did something toward\r\npreserving peace and order in the community. He aided the Union people\r\nand the Union cause in every possible way, and thus became amenable to\r\nthe hostility of the secessionists, who subjected him to great\r\ndifficulty and danger. He was several times arrested, and held for\r\nsome time in custody. At times he was obliged to conceal himself for\r\nsafety. He spent many nights in out-buildings and in the woods to\r\navoid the vengeance of the rebels.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1863, the United States forces under General Burnside\r\nhaving taken possession of Knoxville, Mr. Patterson succeeded, with\r\nhis family, in making his escape to Knoxville, and did not return to\r\nhis home until after the close of the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Judiciary having taken into consideration the\r\nabove and other palliating circumstances, proposed a resolution that\r\nMr. Patterson \"is duly qualified and entitled to hold a seat in the\r\nSenate.\" On motion of Mr. Clark this resolution was amended to read,\r\n\"that, upon taking the oaths required by the Constitution and the\r\nlaws, he be admitted to a seat in the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, however, thought better by the Senate to pass a joint\r\nresolution that in the case of Mr. Patterson there should be omitted\r\nfrom the test oath the following words: \"That I have neither sought,\r\nnor accepted, nor attempted to exercise the functions of any office\r\nwhatever under any authority, or pretended authority, in hostility to\r\nthe United States.\" This joint resolution having passed the Senate,\r\nwas immediately sent to the House of Representatives, then in session,\r\nand at once came up before that body for consideration. The resolution\r\nwas eloquently advocated by Messrs. Maynard and Taylor, and opposed by\r\nMr. Stokes, all of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\"On the night of the 22d of February last,\" said Mr. Stokes, \"I\r\ndelivered a speech in Nashville, and there and then declared, if\r\nadmitted as a member of this House, I would freeze to my seat before I\r\nwould vote to repeal the test oath. [Long-continued applause on the\r\nfloor and in the galleries.] I have made the same declaration in many\r\nspeeches since then.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I regard the test oath passed by the United States Congress as\r\nthe salvation of the Union men of the South as well as of the North. I\r\nregard it as sacred as the flaming sword which the Creator placed in\r\nthe tree of life to guard it, forbidding any one from partaking of the\r\nfruit thereof who was not pure in heart. Sir, this is no light\r\nquestion. Repeal the test oath and you permit men to come into\r\nCongress and take seats who have taken an oath to the Confederate\r\nGovernment, and who have aided and assisted in carrying out its\r\nadministration and laws. That is what we are now asked to do. Look\r\nback to the 14th of August, 1861, the memorable day of the\r\nproclamation issued by Jefferson Davis, ordering every man within the\r\nlines of the confederacy who still held allegiance to the Federal\r\nGovernment to leave within forty-eight hours. That order compelled\r\nmany to seek for hiding-places who could not take the oath of\r\nallegiance to the Confederate Government. When the rebel authorities\r\nsaid to our noble Governor of Tennessee, 'We will throw wide open the\r\nprison doors and let you out, if you will swear allegiance to our\r\ngovernment,' what was his reply? 'You may sever my head from my body,\r\nbut I will never take the oath to the Confederate Government.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. B. Stokes, Representative from Tennessee.]\r\n\r\nMr. Conkling said: \"I should be recreant to candor were I to attempt\r\nto conceal my amazement at the scene now passing before us. Only eight\r\nshort days ago and eleven States were silent and absent here, because\r\nthey had participated in guilty rebellion, and because they were not\r\nin fit condition to share in the government and control of this\r\ncountry. Seven short days ago we found one of these States with\r\nloyalty so far retrieved, one State so far void of present offenses,\r\nthat the ban was withdrawn from her, and she again was placed on an\r\nequal footing with the most favored States in the Union. The doors\r\nwere instantly thrown open to her Senators and Representatives, the\r\nwhole case was disposed of, and the nation approved the act. Here the\r\nmatter should have rested; here it should have been left forever\r\nundisturbed. But no; before one week has made its round, we are called\r\nupon to stultify ourselves, to wound the interests of the nation, to\r\nsurrender the position held by the loyal people of the country almost\r\nunanimously, and the exigency is that a particular citizen of\r\nTennessee seeks to effect his entrance to the Senate of the United\r\nStates without being qualified like every other man who is permitted\r\nto enter there.\r\n\r\n\"We are asked to drive a ploughshare over the very foundation of our\r\nposition; to break down and destroy the bulwark by which we may secure\r\nthe results of a great war and a great history, by which we may\r\npreserve from defilement this place, where alone in our organism the\r\npeople never lose their supremacy, except by the recreancy of their\r\nRepresentatives; a bulwark without which we may not save our\r\nGovernment from disintegration and disgrace. If we do this act, it\r\nwill be a precedent which will carry fatality in its train. From\r\nJefferson Davis to the meanest tool of despotism and treason, every\r\nrebel may come here, and we shall have no reason to assign against his\r\nadmission, except the arbitrary reason of numbers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Conkling closed by moving that the joint resolution be laid on the\r\ntable, which was carried by a vote of eighty-eight to thirty-one.\r\n\r\nDuring the same day's session--which was protracted until seven\r\no'clock of Saturday morning, July 28th--the same subject came up again\r\nin the Senate, on the passage of the resolution to admit Mr. Patterson\r\nto a seat in the Senate upon his taking the oaths required by the\r\nConstitution and laws. After some discussion, the resolution passed,\r\ntwenty-one voting in the affirmative and eleven in the negative.\r\n\r\nMr. Patterson went forward to the desk, and the prescribed oaths\r\nhaving been administered, he took his seat in the Senate. Thus, on the\r\nlast day of the first session of the Thirty-ninth Congress, Tennessee\r\nwas fully reconstructed in her representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nNEGRO SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\n     Review of the Preceding Action -- Efforts of Mr. Yates for\r\n     Unrestricted Suffrage -- Davis's Amendment to Cuvier -- The\r\n     \"Propitious Hour\" -- The Mayor's Remonstrance -- Mr.\r\n     Willey's Amendment -- Mr. Cowan's Amendment for Female\r\n     Suffrage -- Attempt to Out-radical the Radicals -- Opinions\r\n     for and against Female Suffrage -- Reading and Writing as a\r\n     Qualification -- Passage of the Bill -- Objections of the\r\n     President -- Two Senators on the Opinions of the People --\r\n     The Suffrage Bill becomes a Law.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the reässembling of the Thirty-ninth Congress for the second\r\nsession, December 3d, 1866, immediately after the preliminaries of\r\nopening had transpired, Mr. Sumner called up business which had been\r\nintroduced on the first day of the preceding session--a year\r\nbefore--which still remained unfinished--the subject of suffrage in\r\nthe District of Columbia. In so doing, the Senator from Massachusetts\r\nsaid: \"It will be remembered that it was introduced on the first day\r\nof the last session; that it was the subject of repeated discussions\r\nin this chamber; that it was more than once referred to the Committee\r\non the District of Columbia, by whose chairman it was reported back to\r\nthe Senate. At several different stages of the discussion it was\r\nsupposed that we were about to reach a final vote. The country\r\nexpected that vote. It was not had. It ought to have been had. And\r\nnow, sir, I think that the best way is for the Senate in this very\r\nfirst hour of its coming together to put that bill on its passage. It\r\nhas been thoroughly debated. Every Senator here has made up his mind\r\non the question. There is nothing more to be said on either side. So\r\nfar as I am concerned, I am perfectly willing that the vote shall be\r\ntaken without one further word of discussion; but I do think that the\r\nSenate ought not to allow the bill to be postponed. We ought to seize\r\nthis first occasion to put the bill on its passage. The country\r\nexpects it; the country will rejoice and be grateful if you will\r\nsignalize this first day of your coming together by this beautiful and\r\ngenerous act.\"\r\n\r\nObjection being raised to the immediate consideration of the subject,\r\nit was decided that it must be deferred under a rule of the Senate\r\nuntil after the expiration of six days from the commencement of the\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nIt is proper here to present a brief record of the proceedings upon\r\nthe subject during the preceding session. The passage of a bill in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and the discussion upon the subject in that\r\nbody are given in a preceding chapter. This bill, as Mr. Morrill\r\nsubsequently said in the Senate, was not an election bill, and\r\nconferred no right of voting upon any person beyond what he had\r\nbefore. It was a mere declaration of a right to vote. As such, the\r\nbill was favorably received by the Senate Committee to whom it was\r\nreferred, and was by them reported back with favor, but was never put\r\nupon its passage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Senate Committee had under consideration a bill of their\r\nown, which they reported on the 10th of January. This bill provided\r\nfor restricted suffrage, requiring the qualification to read and\r\nwrite. Mr. Yates, an original and uncompromising advocate of universal\r\nsuffrage was opposed to this restriction. He was a member of the\r\nCommittee on the District of Columbia, but had been prevented from\r\nbeing present in its deliberations when it was resolved to report the\r\nbill as then before the Senate. Fearing that the bill might pass the\r\nSenate with the objectionable restrictions, Mr. Yates moved that it be\r\nrecommitted, which was done.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the committee called to reconsider the bill, Mr. Yates\r\nargued at length and with earnestness against disfranchisement on the\r\nground of inability to read and write. The committee reversed their\r\nformer decision, and reported the bill substantially in the form in\r\nwhich it subsequently became a law. The bill being before the Senate\r\non the 16th of January, 1866, Mr. Garrett Davis opposed it in a speech\r\nof great length. He made use of every argument and referred to every\r\nauthority within his reach to prove the inferiority of the negro race.\r\nAfter giving Cuvier's definition of the \"negro,\" the Senator remarked:\r\n\"The great naturalist might have added as other distinctive\r\ncharacteristics of the negro; first, that his skin exhales perpetually\r\na peculiar pungent and disagreeable odor; second, that 'the hollow of\r\nhis foot makes a hole in the ground.'\" The Senator drew a fearful\r\npicture of the schemes of Massachusetts to use the negro voters, whom\r\nit was her policy to create in the South.\r\n\r\nThis subject did not again come up in the Senate until after the lapse\r\nof several months. On the 27th of June it was \"disentombed\" from what\r\nmany supposed was its final resting place. Mr. Morrill proposed as an\r\namendment that the elective franchise should be restricted to persons\r\nwho could read and write. This was rejected; fifteen voting in the\r\naffirmative, and nineteen in the negative.\r\n\r\nMr. Willey opposed the bill before the Senate in a speech of\r\nconsiderable length. He advocated the bestowal of a qualified and\r\nrestricted suffrage upon the colored people of the District. His chief\r\nobjection to the measure before the Senate was that it was untimely.\r\n\"Any thing not essential in itself,\" said he, \"or very material to the\r\nwelfare of the nation, or a considerable part of the nation, if it is\r\ncalculated to complicate our difficulties, or inflame party passions\r\nor sectional animosities, had better be left, it appears to me, to a\r\nmore propitious hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"propitious hour\" hoped for by the Senator, did not come around\r\nuntil after the opening of the second session. The subject did not\r\nagain seriously occupy the attention of the Senate, with the exception\r\nof Mr. Sumner's effort to have it taken up on the first day of the\r\nsession, until the 10th day of December, 1866.\r\n\r\nOn that day, Mr. Morrill, who, as Chairman of the Committee on the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, had the bill in charge, introduced the subject\r\nwith a speech of considerable length. \"This measure,\" said he, \"not\r\nonly regulates the elective franchise in this District, but it extends\r\nand enlarges it. The principal feature of the bill is that it embraces\r\nthe colored citizens of the District of Columbia. In this particular\r\nit is novel, and in this particular it is important. In this\r\nparticular it may be said to be inaugurating a policy not only\r\nstrictly for the District of Columbia, but in some sense for the\r\ncountry at large. In this respect it is, I suppose, that this bill has\r\nreceived so large a share of the public attention during the last\r\nsession and the recess of the Congress of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Morrill called attention to the remonstrance of the Mayor of\r\nWashington, who had informed the Senate that in an election held for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining the sentiments of the voters of the city\r\nupon the subject, some six thousand five hundred were opposed to the\r\nextension of the elective franchise, while only thirty or forty were\r\nin favor of it.\r\n\r\n\"These six or seven thousand voters,\" said Mr. Morrill, \"are only one\r\nin thirty at most of the people of this District, and it is very\r\ndifficult to understand how there could be more significance or\r\nprobative force attached to these six or seven thousand votes than to\r\nan equal number of voices independent of the ballot, under the\r\ncircumstances. This is a matter affecting the capital of the nation,\r\none in which the American people have an interest, as indirectly, at\r\nleast, touching the country at large. What the National Congress\r\npronounce here as a matter of right or expediency, or both, touching a\r\nquestion of popular rights, may have an influence elsewhere for good\r\nor for evil. We can not well justify the denial of the right of\r\nsuffrage to colored citizens on the protest of the voters of the\r\ncorporation of Washington. We may not think fit to grant it simply on\r\nthe prayer of the petitioners. Our action should rest on some\r\nrecognized general principle, which, applied to the capital of the\r\nnation, would be equally just applied to any of the political\r\ncommunities of which the nation is composed.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing his speech, Mr. Morrill remarked: \"In a nation of professed\r\nfreemen, whose political axioms are those of universal liberty and\r\nhuman rights, no public tranquillity is possible while these rights\r\nare denied to portions of the American people. We have taken into the\r\nbosom of the Republic the diverse elements of the nationalities of\r\nEurope, and are attempting to mold them into national harmony and\r\nunity, and are still inviting other millions to come to us. Let us not\r\ndespair that the same mighty energies and regenerating forces will be\r\nable to assign a docile and not untractable race its appropriate place\r\nin our system.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Willey's amendment, proposed when the subject was last considered\r\nin the previous session, six months before, being now the pending\r\nquestion, its author addressed the Senate in favor of some\r\nrestrictions upon the exercise of the elective franchise. \"There ought\r\nto be some obligation,\" said he, \"either in our fundamental laws in\r\nthe States, or somewhere, by some means requiring the people to\r\neducate themselves; and if this can be accomplished by disqualifying\r\nthose who are not educated for the exercise of the right of suffrage,\r\nthus stimulating them to acquire a reasonable degree of education,\r\nthat of itself, it seems to me, would be a public blessing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am against this qualification of reading and writing,\" said Mr.\r\nWilson; \"I never did believe in it. I do not believe in it now. I\r\nvoted against it in my own State, and I intend to vote against it\r\nhere. There was a time when I would have taken it, because I did not\r\nknow that we could get any thing more in this contest; but I think the\r\ngreat victory of manhood suffrage is about achieved in this country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reading and writing, as a qualification for voting,\" said Mr.\r\nPomeroy, \"might be entertained in a State where all the people were\r\nallowed to go to school and learn to read and write; but it seems to\r\nme monstrous to apply it to a class of persons in this community who\r\nwere legislated away from school, to whom every avenue of learning was\r\nshut up by law.\"\r\n\r\nSome discussion was elicited by a proposition made by Mr. Anthony to\r\nattach to Mr. Willey's amendment a provision excluding from the right\r\nto vote all \"who in any way voluntarily gave aid and comfort to the\r\nrebels during the late rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nThis was opposed by Mr. Wilson. \"We better not meddle with that matter\r\nof disfranchisement,\" said he. \"There are but few of these persons\r\nhere, so the prohibition will practically not amount to any thing. As\r\nwe are to accomplish a great object, to establish universal suffrage,\r\nwe should let alone all propositions excluding a few men here.\r\nDisfranchisement will create more feeling and more bitterness than\r\nenfranchisement.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Willey's amendment was finally so much \"amended\" that he could not\r\nsupport it himself, and it received but one affirmative vote, that of\r\nMr. Kirkwood.\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan proposed to amend the bill by striking out the word \"male\"\r\nbefore the word \"person,\" that females might enjoy the elective\r\nfranchise. \"I propose to extend this privilege,\" said he, \"not only to\r\nmales, but to females as well; and I should like to hear even the most\r\nastute and learned Senator upon this floor give any better, reason for\r\nthe exclusion of females from the right of suffrage than there is for\r\nthe exclusion of negroes.\r\n\r\n\"If you want to widen the franchise so as to purify your ballot-box,\r\nthrow the virtue of the country into it; throw the temperance of the\r\ncountry into it; throw the purity of the country into it; throw the\r\nangel element--if I may so express myself--into it. [Laughter.] Let\r\nthere be as little diabolism as possible, but as much of the divinity\r\nas you can get.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion being resumed on the following day, Mr. Anthony\r\nadvocated Mr. Cowan's amendment. \"I suppose,\" said he, \"that the\r\nSenator from Pennsylvania introduced this amendment rather as a satire\r\nupon the bill itself, or if he had any serious intention, it was only\r\na mischievous one to injure the bill. But it will not probably have\r\nthat effect, for I suppose nobody will vote for it except the Senator\r\nhimself, who can hardly avoid it, and I, who shall vote for it because\r\nit accords with a conclusion to which I have been brought by\r\nconsiderable study upon the subject of suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having answered objections against female suffrage, Mr. Anthony\r\nremarked in conclusion: \"I should not have introduced this question;\r\nbut as it has been introduced, and I intend to vote for the amendment,\r\nI desire to declare here that I shall vote for it in all seriousness,\r\nbecause I think it is right. The discussion of this subject is not\r\nconfined to visionary enthusiasts. It is now attracting the attention\r\nof some of the best thinkers in the world, both in this country and in\r\nEurope; and one of the very best of them all, John Stuart Mill, in a\r\nmost elaborate and able paper, has declared his conviction of the\r\nright and justice of female suffrage. The time has not come for it,\r\nbut the time is coming. It is coming with the progress of civilization\r\nand the general amelioration of the race, and the triumph of truth,\r\nand justice, and equal rights.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Williams opposed the pending amendment. \"To extend the right of\r\nsuffrage to the negroes in this country,\" said he, \"I think is\r\nnecessary for their protection; but to extend the right of suffrage to\r\nwomen, in my judgment, is not necessary for their protection. Wide as\r\nthe poles apart are the conditions of these two classes of persons.\r\nThe sons defend and protect the reputation and rights of their\r\nmothers; husbands defend and protect the reputation and rights of\r\ntheir wives; brothers defend and protect the reputation and rights of\r\ntheir sisters; and to honor, cherish, and love the women of this\r\ncountry is the pride and the glory of its sons.\r\n\r\n\"When the women of this country come to be sailors and soldiers; when\r\nthey come to navigate the ocean and to follow the plow; when they love\r\nto be jostled and crowded by all sorts of men in the thoroughfares of\r\ntrade and business; when they love the treachery and the turmoil of\r\npolitics; when they love the dissoluteness of the camp, and the smoke\r\nof the thunder, and the blood of battle better than they love the\r\naffections and enjoyments of home and family, then it will be time to\r\ntalk about making the women voters; but until that time, the question\r\nis not fairly before the country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan defended his amendment and his position. \"When the time\r\ncomes,\" said he, \"I am a Radical, too, along with my fellow Senators\r\nhere. By what warrant do they suppose that I am not interested in the\r\nprogress of the race? If the thing is to be bettered, I want to better\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Morrill replied to the speech of Mr. Cowan. \"Does any suppose,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Morrill, \"that he is at all in earnest or sincere in a single\r\nsentiment he has uttered on this subject? I do not imagine he believes\r\nthat any one here is idle enough for a moment to suppose so. If it is\r\ntrue, as he intimates, that he is desirous of becoming a Radical, I am\r\nnot clear that I should not be willing to accept his service, although\r\nthere is a good deal to be repented of before he can be taken into\r\nfull confidence. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n\"When a man has seen the error of his ways and confesses it, what more\r\nis there to be done except to receive him seventy and seven times?\r\nNow, if this is an indication that the honorable Senator means to\r\nout-radical the Radicals, 'Come on, Macduff,' nobody will object,\r\nprovided you can show us you are sincere. That is the point. If it is\r\nmischief you are at, you will have a hard time to get ahead. While we\r\nare radical we mean to be rational. While we intend to give every male\r\ncitizen of the United States the rights common to all, we do not\r\nintend to be forced by our enemies into a position so ridiculous and\r\nabsurd as to be broken down utterly on that question, and who ever\r\ncomes here in the guise of a Radical and undertakes to practice that\r\nprobably will not make much by the motion. I am not surprised that\r\nthose of our friends who went out from us and have been feeding on the\r\nhusks desire to get in ahead; but I am surprised at the indiscretion\r\nand the want of common sense exercised in making so profound a plunge\r\nat once! If these gentlemen desire to be taken into companionship and\r\nrestored to good standing, I am the first man to reach out the hand\r\nand say, 'Welcome back again, so that you are repentant and\r\nregenerated;' but, sir, I am the last man to allow that you shall\r\nindorse what you call Radicalism for the purpose of breaking down\r\nmeasures which we propose!\"\r\n\r\n\"He alleges,\" replied Mr. Cowan, \"that I am not serious in the\r\namendment I have moved; that I am not in earnest about it. How does he\r\nknow? By what warrant does he undertake to say that a brother Senator\r\nhere is not serious, not in earnest? I should like to know by what\r\nwarrant he undertakes to do that. He says I do not look serious. I\r\nhave not perhaps been trained in the same vinegar and persimmon\r\nschool, [laughter;] I have not been doctrinated into the same solemn\r\nnasal twang which may characterize the gentleman, and which may be\r\nconsidered to be the evidence of seriousness and earnestness. I\r\ngenerally speak as a man, and as a good-natured man, I think. I hope I\r\nentertain no malice toward any body. But the honorable Senator thinks\r\nthat I want to become a Radical. Why, sir, common charity ought to\r\nhave taught the honorable Senator better than that. I think no such\r\nimputation, even on the part of the most virulent opponent that I\r\nhave, can with any justice be laid to my door. I have never yielded to\r\nhis radicalism; I have never truckled to it. Whether it be right or\r\nwrong, I have never bowed the knee to it. From the very word 'go' I\r\nhave been a Conservative; I have endeavored to save all in our\r\ninstitutions that I thought worth saving.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wade had introduced the original bill, and had put it upon the\r\nmost liberal principle of franchise. \"The question of female\r\nsuffrage,\" said he, \"had not then been much agitated, and I knew the\r\ncommunity had not thought sufficiently upon it to be ready to\r\nintroduce it as an element in our political system. While I am aware\r\nof that fact, I think it will puzzle any gentleman to draw a line of\r\ndemarcation between the right of the male and the female on this\r\nsubject. Both are liable to all the laws you pass; their property,\r\ntheir persons, and their lives are affected by the laws. Why, then,\r\nshould not the females have a right to participate in their\r\nconstruction as well as the male part of the community? There is no\r\nargument that I can conceive or that I have yet heard that makes any\r\ndiscrimination between the two on the question of right.\r\n\r\n\"I shall give a vote on this amendment that will be deemed an\r\nunpopular vote, but I am not frightened by that. I have been\r\naccustomed to give such votes all my life almost, but I believe they\r\nhave been given in the cause of human liberty and right and in the way\r\nof the advancing intelligence of our age; and whenever the landmark\r\nhas been set up the community have marched up to it. I think I am\r\nadvocating now the same kind of a principle, and I have no doubt that\r\nsooner or later it will become a fixed fact, and the community will\r\nthink it just as absurd to exclude females from the ballot-box as\r\nmales.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Yates opposed the pending amendment, deeming it a mere attempt on\r\nthe part of the Senator from Pennsylvania to embarrass this question.\r\n\"Logically,\" said he, \"there are no reasons in my mind which would not\r\npermit women to vote as well as men, according to the theory of our\r\ngovernment. But that question, as to whether ladies shall vote or not,\r\nis not at issue now. I confess that I am for universal suffrage, and\r\nwhen the time comes, I am for suffrage by females as well as males.\"\r\n\r\n\"While I will vote now,\" said Mr. Wilson, \"or at any time, for woman\r\nsuffrage as a distinct, separate measure, I am unalterably opposed to\r\nconnecting that question with the pending question of negro suffrage.\r\nThe question of negro suffrage is now an imperative necessity; a\r\nnecessity that the negro should possess it for his own protection; a\r\nnecessity that he should possess it that the nation may preserve its\r\npower, its strength, and its unity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why was the consideration of this measure discontinued at the last\r\nsession, and the bill not allowed to pass the Senate?\" asked Mr.\r\nHendricks.\r\n\r\n\"The bill passed the House of Representatives early in the session,\"\r\nreplied Mr. Wilson. \"It came to the Senate early in December. That\r\nSenator, I think, knows very well that we had not the power to pass it\r\nfor the first five or six months of the session; that is, we had not\r\nthe power to make it a law. We could not have carried it against the\r\nopposition of the President of the United States, and we had\r\nassurances of gentlemen who were in intimate relations with him that\r\nhis signature would not be obtained. It would not have been wise for\r\nus to pass the bill if it was to encounter a veto, unless we were able\r\nto pass it over that veto. The wise course was to bide our time until\r\nwe had that power, and that power came before the close of the\r\nsession, but it came in the time of great pressure, when other\r\nquestions were crowding upon us, and it was thought best by those who\r\nwere advocating it, especially as the chairman of the committee, the\r\nSenator from Maine, [Mr. Morrill,] was out of the Senate for many days\r\non account of illness, to let the bill go over until this December.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson opposed the pending amendment. \"I think if it was\r\nsubmitted to the ladies,\" said he--\"I mean the ladies in the true\r\nacceptation of the term--of the United States, the privilege would not\r\nonly not be asked for, but would be rejected. I do not think the\r\nladies of the United States would agree to enter into a canvass and\r\nundergo what is often the degradation of seeking to vote, particularly\r\nin the cities, getting up to the polls, crowded out and crowded in. I\r\nrather think they would feel it, instead of a privilege, a dishonor.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson was unwilling to vote for the amendment with a view to\r\ndefeat the bill. \"I have lived to be too old,\" said he, \"and have\r\nbecome too well satisfied of what I think is my duty to the country to\r\ngive any vote which I do not believe, if it should be supported by the\r\nvotes of a sufficient number to carry the measure into operation,\r\nwould redound to the interests and safety and honor of the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"The women of America,\" said Mr. Frelinghuysen, \"vote by faithful and\r\ntrue representatives, their husbands, their brothers, their sons; and\r\nno true man will go to the polls and deposit his ballot without\r\nremembering the true and loving constituency that he has at home. More\r\nthan that, sir, ninety-nine out of a hundred, I believe nine hundred\r\nand ninety-nine out of a thousand, of the women in America do not want\r\nthe privilege of voting in any other manner than that which I have\r\nstated. In both these regards there is a vast difference between the\r\nsituation of the colored citizens and the women of America.\r\n\r\n\"The learned and eloquent Senator from Pennsylvania said yesterday\r\nwith great beauty that he wanted to cast the angel element into the\r\nsuffrage system of America. Sir, it seems to me, that it would be\r\nruthlessly tearing the angel element from the homes of America; and\r\nthe homes of the people of America are infinitely more valuable than\r\nany suffrage system. It will be a sorry day for this country when\r\nthose vestal fires of piety and love are put out.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day, December 12th, the discussion being resumed, Mr.\r\nBrown advocated the amendment. \"I stand,\" said he, \"for universal\r\nsuffrage, and as a matter of fundamental principle do not recognize\r\nthe right of society to limit it on any ground of race, color, or sex.\r\nI will go further and say that I recognize the right of franchise as\r\nbeing intrinsically a natural right; and I do not believe that society\r\nis authorized to impose any limitation upon it that does not spring\r\nout of the necessities of the social state itself.\"\r\n\r\nBelieving \"that the metaphysical always controls the practical in all\r\nthe affairs of life,\" Mr. Brown gave the \"abstract grounds\" upon which\r\nhe deemed the right of woman to the elective franchise rested. Coming\r\nfinally to the more practical bearings of the subject, he answered the\r\nobjection, that \"if women are entitled to the rights of franchise,\r\nthey would correspondingly come under the obligation to bear arms.\"\r\n\"Are there not large classes,\" he asked, \"even among men in this\r\ncountry, who are exempt from service in our armies for physical\r\nincapacity and for other reasons? And if exemptions which appertain to\r\nmales may be recognized as valid, why not similar exemptions for like\r\nreasons when applied to females? Does it not prove that there is\r\nnothing in the argument so far as it involves the question of right?\r\nThere are Quakers and other religious sects; there are ministers of\r\nthe Gospel; persons having conscientious scruples; indeed, all men\r\nover a certain age who under the laws of many of the States are\r\nreleased from service of that character. Indeed, it is the boast of\r\nthis republic that ours is a volunteer military establishment. Hence I\r\nsay there is nothing in the position that because she may not be\r\nphysically qualified for service in your army, therefore you have the\r\nright to deny her the franchise on the score of sex.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing an extended speech, Mr. Brown remarked: \"Even though I\r\nrecognize the impolicy of coupling these two measures in this manner\r\nand at this time, I shall yet record my vote in the affirmative as an\r\nearnest indication of my belief in the principle, and my faith in the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis made another protracted speech against both the amendment\r\nand the original bill. \"The great God,\" said he, \"who created all the\r\nraces, and in every race gave to man woman, never intended that woman\r\nshould take part in national government among any people, or that the\r\nnegro, the lowest, should ever have coördinate and equal power with\r\nthe highest, the white race, in any government, national or\r\ndomestic.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Mr. Davis advised the late rebels to \"resist this\r\ngreat, this most foul, cruel, and dishonoring enslavement. Men of the\r\nSouth, exhaust every peaceful means of redress, and when your\r\noppressions become unendurable, and it is demonstrated that there is\r\nno other hope, then strike for your liberty, and strike as did your\r\nfathers in 1776, and as did the Hollanders and Zealanders, led by\r\nWilliam the Silent, to break their chains, forged by the tyrants of\r\nSpain.\"\r\n\r\n\"When it is necessary,\" said Mr. Sprague, \"that woman shall vote for\r\nthe support of liberty and equality, I shall be ready to cast my vote\r\nin their favor. The black man's vote is necessary to this at this\r\ntime. Do not prostrate all the industrial interests of the North by a\r\npolicy of conciliation and of inaction. Delays are dangerous,\r\ncriminal. When you shall have established, firmly and fearlessly,\r\ngovernments at the South friendly to the republic; when you shall have\r\nceased from receiving terms and propositions from the leaders of the\r\nrebellion as to their reconstruction; when you shall have promptly\r\nacted in the interest of liberty, prosperity will light upon the\r\nindustries of your people, and panics, commercial and mercantile\r\nrevolutions, will be placed afar off; and never, sir, until that time\r\nshall have arrived. And as an humble advocate of all industrial\r\ninterests of the free people of the North, white and black, and as an\r\nhumble representative of these interests, I urge prompt action to-day,\r\nto-morrow, and every day until the work has been completed. Let no\r\nobstacle stand in the way now, no matter what it may be. You will save\r\nyour people from poverty and free principles from a more desperate\r\ncombat than they have yet witnessed. Ridicule may be used in this\r\nchamber, calumny may prevail through the country, and murder may be a\r\ncommon occurrence South to those who stand firmly thus and who\r\nadvocate such measures. Let it be so; for greater will be the crowning\r\nglory of those who are not found wanting in the day of victory. Let\r\nus, then, press to the vote; one glorious step taken, then we may take\r\nothers in the same direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"The objection,\" said Mr. Buckalew, \"which I have to a large extension\r\nof suffrage in this country, whether by Federal or State power, is\r\nthis: that thereby you will corrupt and degrade elections, and\r\nprobably lead to their complete abrogation hereafter. By pouring into\r\nthe ballot-boxes of the country a large mass of ignorant votes, and\r\nvotes subjected to pecuniary or social influence, you will corrupt and\r\ndegrade your elections and lay the foundation for their ultimate\r\ndestruction.\"\r\n\r\n\"After giving some considerable reflection to the subject of\r\nsuffrage,\" said Mr. Doolittle, \"I have arrived at the conclusion that\r\nthe true base or foundation upon which to rest suffrage in any\r\nrepublican community is upon the family, the head of the family;\r\nbecause in civilized society the family is the unit, not the\r\nindividual.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pomeroy was in favor of the bill without the proposed amendment.\r\n\"I do not want to weigh it down,\" said he, \"with any thing else. There\r\nare other measures that I would be glad to support in their proper\r\nplace and time; but this is a great measure of itself. Since I have\r\nbeen a member of the Senate, there was a law in this District\r\nauthorizing the selling of these people. To have traveled in six years\r\nfrom the auction-block to the ballot with these people is an immense\r\nstride, and if we can carry this measure alone, of itself, we should\r\nbe contented for the present.\"\r\n\r\nThe vote being taken on Mr. Cowan's amendment conferring the elective\r\nfranchise upon women, the result was yeas, nine; nays, thirty-seven.\r\nThe following are the names of those who voted in the affirmative:\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Anthony, Brown, Buckalew, Cowan, Foster, Nesmith,\r\n     Patterson, Riddle, and Wade.\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon then moved to amend the bill by adding a proviso:\r\n\r\n     \"That no person who has not heretofore voted in this\r\n     District shall be permitted to vote unless he shall be able,\r\n     at the time of offering to vote, to read and also write his\r\n     own name.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would deny to no man,\" said Mr. Dixon, \"the right of voting solely\r\non account of his color; but I doubt the propriety of permitting any\r\nman to vote, whatever his race or color, who has not at least that\r\nproof of intelligence which the ability to read and write furnishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the test?\" asked Mr. Saulsbury. \"A person who can read and\r\nwrite. Is it his name, or only read and write?\"\r\n\r\n\"His name,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"Read and write his name!\" continued Mr. Saulsbury. \"A wonderful\r\namount of education to qualify a man for the discharge of the high\r\noffice and trust of voting! Great knowledge of the system of\r\ngovernment under which we live does this impart to the voter!\"\r\n\r\n\"If this were really an intelligence qualification,\" said Mr. Cowan,\r\n\"I do not know what I might say; but of the fact that the ability of a\r\nman merely to write his own name and read it, is intelligence, I am\r\nnot informed. To write a man's name is simply a mechanical operation.\r\nIt may be taught to any body, even people of the most limited\r\ncapacity, in twenty minutes; and to read it afterward certainly would\r\nnot be very difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand the amendment to include,\" said Mr. Willey, \"the\r\nqualification of reading generally, and also of writing his name; two\r\ntests, one the reading generally, and the other the writing his own\r\nname.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is its precision?\" asked Mr. Cowan; \"where is it to end, and\r\nwho shall determine its limits? I will put the case of a board\r\nbelonging to the dominant party, and suppose they have the statute\r\namended by my honorable friend from Connecticut before them, and a\r\ncolored man comes forward and proposes to vote. They put to him the\r\nquestion, 'Can you write your name and read?' 'Oh, yes.' 'Well, let us\r\nsee you try it.' He then writes his name and he reads it; and he is\r\nadmitted if he is understood to belong to that party. But suppose, as\r\nhas recently happened, that this dark man should come to the\r\nconclusion to vote on the other side, and it were known that he meant\r\nto vote on the other side, what kind of a chance would he have? Then\r\nthe man of the dominant party, who desires to carry the election,\r\nsays, 'You shall not only write your name and read it, but you must\r\nread generally. I have read the senatorial debates upon this question,\r\nand the honorable Senator from West Virginia, who originated this\r\namendment, was of opinion that a man should read generally. Now, sir,\r\nread generally, if you please.' 'Well,' says he, 'what shall I read?'\r\nRead a section of the _Novum Organum_, or some other most difficult\r\nand abstruse thing, or a few sections from Okie's Physiology.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of December, the last day of the discussion, Mr. Anthony\r\noccupied the chair during a portion of the session, and Mr. Foster\r\ntook the floor in favor of the amendment proposed by his colleague.\r\n\"The honorable Senator from Pennsylvania,\" said he, \"from the manner\r\nin which he treats this subject, I should think, was now fresh from\r\nhis reading of 'Much A-do about Nothing,' and was quoting Mr. Justice\r\nDogberry, who said, 'To be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune,\r\nbut to read and write comes by nature.' The Senator from Pennsylvania\r\nand others seem inclined to say, 'Away with writing and reading till\r\nthere is need of such vanity.' I believe that the idea of admitting\r\nmen to the elective franchise who can neither read nor write is going\r\nbackward and downward.\r\n\r\n\"Who are the men who come forward to deposit their ballots in the\r\nballot-boxes? They are the people of this country, to whom all\r\nquestions must ultimately go for examination and correction. They\r\ncorrect the mistakes which we make, and which Congress makes, and\r\nwhich the Supreme Court makes. The electors at the ballot-boxes are\r\nthe grand court of errors for the country. Now, sir, these Senators\r\npropose to allow men who can not read and write to correct our\r\nmistakes, to become members of this high court of errors.\r\n\r\n\"The honorable Senator from Massachusetts says he wants to put the\r\nballot into the hands of the black man for his protection. If he can\r\nnot read the ballot, what kind of protection is it to him? A Written\r\nor printed slip of paper is put into the hands of a man, black or\r\nwhite, and if he can not read it, what is it to him? What does he know\r\nabout it? What can he do with it? How can he protect himself by it? As\r\nwell might the honorable Senator from Massachusetts put in the hands\r\nof a child who knew nothing of firearms a loaded pistol, with which to\r\nprotect himself against his enemies. The child would be much more\r\nlikely to endanger himself and his friends by the pistol than to\r\nprotect himself. A perfectly ignorant man who can not read his ballot\r\nis much more likely to use it to his own detriment, and to the\r\ndetriment of the country, than he is to use it for the benefit of\r\neither.\"\r\n\r\n\"The argument in favor of making the right to vote universal,\" said\r\nMr. Frelinghuysen, in making a second speech upon the question, \"is\r\nthat the ballot itself is a great education; that by its encouraging\r\nthe citizen, by its inspiring him, it adds dignity to his character,\r\nand makes him strive to acquire learning. Secondly, that if the voting\r\ndepended on learning, no inducement is extended to communities\r\nunfavorable to the right of voting in the colored man to give him the\r\nopportunity to learn; they would rather embarrass him, to prevent his\r\nmaking the acquisition, unless they were in favor of his voting; while\r\nif voting is universal, communities, for their own security, for their\r\nown protection, will be driven to establish common schools, so that\r\nthe voter shall become intelligent.\"\r\n\r\nPursuing a similar line of thought, Mr. Wilson said: \"Allow the black\r\nmen to vote without this qualification and they will demand education,\r\nthe school-houses will rise, school-teachers will be employed, these\r\npeople will attend the schools, and the cause of education will be\r\ncarried forward in this District with more rapidity than at any other\r\nperiod in its history. Give the negro the right of suffrage, and\r\nbefore a year passes round, you will see these men, who voted that\r\nthey should not have the right to vote, running after them, and\r\ninquiring after the health of their wives and children. I do not think\r\nthe Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Davis] will be examining their pelvis\r\nor shins, or making speeches about the formation of their lips, or the\r\nangle of their foreheads on the floor of the Senate. You will then see\r\nthe Democracy, with the keen scent that always distinguishes that\r\nparty, on the hunt after the votes of these black men, [laughter;] and\r\nif they treat them better than the Republicans do, they will probably\r\nget their votes, and I hope they will.\r\n\r\n\"And it will be just so down in these rebel States. Give the negroes\r\nof Virginia the right to vote, and you will find Wise and Letcher and\r\nthe whole tribe of the secessionists undertaking to prove that from\r\nthe landing at Jamestown in 1620 the first families of the Old\r\nDominion have always been the champions and the special friends of the\r\nnegroes of Old Virginia, and that there is a great deal of kindred\r\nbetween them, [laughter;] that they are relations, brethren; that the\r\nsame red blood courses in the veins of many of them. They will\r\nestablish all these things, perhaps by affidavits. [Laughter.] And I\r\nsay to you, sir, they will have a good opportunity to get a good many\r\nof their votes, for in these respects they have the advantage of us\r\npoor Republicans.\"\r\n\r\nOf the pending amendment, Mr. Hendricks said: \"I propose to vote for\r\nit, not because I am in favor, as a general proposition, of an\r\nintelligence qualification for the right to vote, but because in this\r\nparticular instance, I think it to be proper to prescribe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall vote,\" said Mr. Lane, \"to enfranchise the colored residents\r\nof this District because I believe it is right, just, and proper;\r\nbecause I believe it is in accordance with those two grand central\r\ntruths around which cluster every hope for redeemed humanity, the\r\ncommon fatherhood of God above us and the brotherhood of universal\r\nmankind.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bill for Impartial Suffrage in the District of Columbia,\" said\r\nMr. Sumner, \"concerns directly some twenty thousand colored persons,\r\nwhom it will lift to the adamantine platform of equal rights. If it\r\nwere regarded simply in its bearings on the District it would be\r\ndifficult to exaggerate its value; but when it is regarded as an\r\nexample to the whole country under the sanction of Congress, its value\r\nis infinite. It is in the latter character that it becomes a pillar of\r\nfire to illumine the footsteps of millions. What we do here will be\r\ndone in the disorganized States. Therefore, we must be careful that\r\nwhat we do here is best for the disorganized States.\r\n\r\n\"When I am asked to open the suffrage to women, or when I am asked to\r\nestablish an educational standard, I can not on the present bill\r\nsimply because the controlling necessity under which we act will not\r\nallow it. By a singular Providence we are now constrained to this\r\nmeasure of enfranchisement for the sake of peace, security, and\r\nreconciliation, so that loyal persons, white or black, may be\r\nprotected and that the Republic may live. Here in the District of\r\nColumbia we begin the real work of reconstruction by which the Union\r\nwill be consolidated forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe question was taken upon Mr. Dixon's amendment, which was lost;\r\neleven voting for, and thirty-four against the proposition. The vote\r\nwas then taken upon the bill to regulate the elective franchise in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. It passed the Senate, thirty-two voting in the\r\naffirmative, and thirteen in the negative.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, December 14th, the bill came before the House of\r\nRepresentatives and passed without discussion; one hundred and\r\neighteen voting in the affirmative, and forty-six in the negative.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of January, the President returned the bill to the Senate\r\nwith his objections. The Veto Message was immediately read by the\r\nSecretary of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe President's first objection to the bill was that it was not in\r\naccordance with the wishes of the people to whom it was to apply, they\r\nhaving \"solemnly and with such unanimity\" protested against it.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the President that Congress sustained a relation to the\r\ninhabitants of the District of Columbia analogous to that of a\r\nlegislature to the people of a State, and \"should have a like respect\r\nfor the will and interests of its inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nWithout actually bringing the charge of unconstitutionality against\r\nthis measure, the President declared \"that Congress is bound to\r\nobserve the letter and spirit of the Constitution, as well in the\r\nenactment of local laws for the Seat of Government, as in legislation\r\ncommon to the entire Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe Civil Rights Bill having become a law, it was, in the opinion of\r\nthe President, a sufficient protection for the negro. \"It can not be\r\nurged,\" said he, \"that the proposed extension of suffrage in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia is necessary to enable persons of color to\r\nprotect either their interests or their rights.\"\r\n\r\nThe President argued that the negroes were unfitted for the exercise\r\nof the elective franchise, and \"can not be expected correctly to\r\ncomprehend the duties and responsibilities which pertain to suffrage.\r\nIt follows, therefore, that in admitting to the ballot-box a new class\r\nof voters not qualified for the exercise of the elective franchise, we\r\nweaken our system of government instead of adding to its strength and\r\ndurability. It may be safely assumed that no political truth is better\r\nestablished than that such indiscriminate and all-embracing extension\r\nof popular suffrage must end at last in its destruction.\"\r\n\r\nThe President occupied a considerable portion of his Message with a\r\nwarning to the people against the dangers of the abuse of legislative\r\npower. He quoted from Judge Story that the legislative branch may\r\nabsorb all the powers of the government. He quoted also the language\r\nof Mr. Jefferson that one hundred and seventy tyrants are more\r\ndangerous than one tyrant.\r\n\r\nThe statements of the President in opposition to the bill were\r\ncharacterized by Mr. Sherman as \"but a _resume_ of the arguments\r\nalready adduced in the Senate,\" hence but little effort was made by\r\nthe friends of the measure to reply.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman, in noticing the President's statements in regard to the\r\ndanger of invasions by Congress of the just powers of the executive\r\nand judicial departments, said, \"I do not think that there is any\r\noccasion for such a warning, because I am not aware that in this bill\r\nCongress has ever assumed any doubtful power. The power of Congress\r\nover this District is without limit, and, therefore, in prescribing\r\nwho shall vote for mayor and city council of this city it can not be\r\nclaimed that we usurp power or exercise a doubtful power.\r\n\r\n\"There can be but little danger from Congress; for our acts are but\r\nthe reflection of the will of the people. The recent acts of Congress\r\nat the last session, those acts upon which the President and Congress\r\nseparated, were submitted to the people, and they decided in favor of\r\nCongress. Unless, therefore, there is an inherent danger from a\r\nrepublican government, resting solely upon the will of the people,\r\nthere is no occasion for the warning of the President. Unless the\r\njudgment of one man is better than the combined judgment of a great\r\nmajority, he should have respected their decision, and not continue a\r\ncontroversy in which our common constituency have decided that he was\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nThe last speech, before taking the vote, was made by Mr. Doolittle.\r\n\"Men speak,\" said he, \"of universal negro suffrage as having been\r\nspoken in favor of in the late election. There is not a State in this\r\nUnion, outside of New England, which would vote in favor of universal\r\nnegro suffrage. When gentlemen tell me that the people of the whole\r\nNorth, by any thing that transpired in the late election, have decided\r\nin favor of universal, unqualified negro suffrage, they assume that\r\nfor which there is no foundation whatever.\"\r\n\r\nThe question being taken whether the bill should pass over the\r\nPresident's veto, the Senate decided in the affirmative by a vote of\r\ntwenty-nine yeas to ten nays.\r\n\r\nThe next day, January 8th, the bill was passed over the veto by the\r\nHouse of Representatives, without debate, by a vote of one hundred and\r\nthirteen yeas to thirty-eight nays. The Speaker then declared that\r\nnotwithstanding the objections of the President of the United States,\r\nthe act to regulate the elective franchise in the District of Columbia\r\nhad become a law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY RECONSTRUCTION ACT.\r\n\r\n     Proposition by Mr. Stevens -- \"Piratical Governments\" not to\r\n     be Recognized -- The Military Feature Introduced -- Mr.\r\n     Schofield's Dog -- The Only Hope of Mr. Hise -- Conversation\r\n     Concerning the Reconstruction Committee -- Censure of a\r\n     Member -- A Military Bill Reported -- War Predicted -- The\r\n     \"Blaine Amendment\" -- Bill Passes the House -- In the Senate\r\n     -- Proposition to Amend -- Mr. Mcdougall Desires Liberty of\r\n     Speech -- Mr. Doolittle Pleads for the Life of the Republic\r\n     -- Mr. Sherman's Amendment -- Passage in the Senate --\r\n     Discussion and Non-concurrence in the House -- The Senate\r\n     Unyielding -- Qualified Concurrence of the House -- The Veto\r\n     -- \"The Funeral of the Nation\" -- The Act -- Supplementary\r\n     Legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the passage of the bill extending the elective franchise in\r\nthe District of Columbia, Congress was occupied in devising and\r\ndiscussing a practical and efficient measure for the reconstruction of\r\nthe rebel States. The germ of the great \"Act for the more efficient\r\ngovernment of the rebel States\" is to be found in the previous session\r\nof Congress in a proposition made by Mr. Stevens on the 28th of May\r\n\"to enable the States lately in rebellion to regain their privileges\r\nin the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Amendment had been eliminated in the Senate of\r\nfeatures which Mr. Stevens regarded as of great importance. There was\r\nan indisposition on the part of the House to declaring by an act of\r\nCongress that the rebel States should be restored on the sole\r\ncondition of their accepting and ratifying the Constitutional\r\nAmendment. The bill proposed by Mr. Stevens was designed by its author\r\nas a plan of restoration to take the place of the proposition which\r\naccompanied the Constitutional Amendment. This bill recognized the _de\r\nfacto_ State governments at the South as valid \"for municipal\r\npurposes.\" It required the President to issue a proclamation within\r\nsix months calling conventions to form legitimate State constitutions,\r\nwhich should be ratified by the people. All male citizens above\r\ntwenty-one years of age should be voters, and should be eligible to\r\nmembership in these constitutional conventions. All persons who held\r\noffice under the \"government called the Confederate States of\r\nAmerica,\" or swore allegiance thereto, were declared to have forfeited\r\ntheir citizenship, and were required to be naturalized as foreigners\r\nbefore being allowed to vote. All citizens should be placed upon an\r\nequal footing in the reörganized States.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of July, the last day of the session, Mr. Stevens brought\r\nthis bill to the notice of the House, without demanding any action\r\nupon it. He made a solemn and affecting appeal to the House, and\r\ninsisted upon it as the great duty of Congress to give all loyal men,\r\nwhite and black, the means of self-protection. \"In this, perhaps my\r\nfinal action,\" said he, \"on this great question, upon careful review,\r\nI can see nothing in my political course, especially in regard to\r\nhuman freedom, which I could wish to have expurged or changed.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of December, 1866, a few days after the reässembling of\r\nCongress for the second session, Mr. Stevens called up his bill for\r\nthe purpose of amending it and putting it in proper shape for the\r\nconsideration of Congress after the holidays.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of January, 1867, Mr. Stevens addressed the House in favor\r\nof his plan of reconstruction. \"This bill,\" said he, \"is designed to\r\nenable loyal men, so far as I could discriminate them in these States,\r\nto form governments which shall be in loyal hands, and may protect\r\nthem from outrages.\"\r\n\r\nAs an amendment to this bill, Mr. Ashley, chairman of the Committee on\r\nTerritories, offered a substitute which was intended to establish\r\nprovisional governments in the rebel States.\r\n\r\nMr. Pike brought in review before the House three modes of dealing\r\nwith the rebel States which had been proposed for the consideration\r\nand decision of Congress. The first was the immediate admission of the\r\nStates into a full participation in the Government, treating them as\r\nif they had never been in rebellion. The second was \"the let-alone\r\npolicy, which would merely refuse them representation until they had\r\nadopted the constitutional amendments.\" The third mode was \"the\r\nimmediate action by Congress in superseding the governments of those\r\nStates set up by the President in 1865, and establishing in their\r\nplace governments founded upon loyalty and universal suffrage.\" The\r\npolicy last mentioned was advocated by Mr. Pike. \"It has got to be\r\ntime for action,\" said he, \"if we are to fulfill the reasonable\r\nexpectations of the country during the life of this Congress.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of January Mr. Stevens proposed to amend his bill by\r\ninserting a provision that no person should be disfranchised as a\r\npunishment for any crime other than insurrection or treason. He gave\r\nas a reason for proposing this amendment that in North Carolina, and\r\nother States where punishment at the whipping-post deprives the person\r\nof the right to vote, they were every day whipping negroes for trivial\r\noffenses. He had heard of one county where the authorities had whipped\r\nevery adult negro they knew of.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of January a speech was made by Mr. Broomall advocating the\r\npassage of the bill before the House. \"Can the negro in the South\r\npreserve his civil rights without political ones?\" he asked. \"Let the\r\nconvention riot of New Orleans answer; let the terrible three days in\r\nMemphis answer. In the latter city three hundred negroes, who had\r\nperiled their lives in the service of their country, and still wore\r\nits uniform, were compelled to look on while the officers of the law,\r\nelected by white men, set their dwellings in flames and fired upon\r\ntheir wives and children as they escaped from the doors and windows.\r\nTheir churches and school-houses were burned because they were their\r\nchurches and school-houses. Yet no arrest, no conviction, no\r\npunishment awaits the perpetrators of these deeds, who walk in open\r\nday and boast of their enormities, because, forsooth, this is a white\r\nman's Government.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of January the discussion was resumed. Mr. Paine first\r\naddressed the House. He opposed the second section of the bill, which\r\nrecognized the _de facto_ governments of the rebel States as valid for\r\nmunicipal purposes. \"I am surprised,\" said he, \"that the gentleman\r\nfrom Pennsylvania should be ready, voluntarily, to assume this burden\r\nof responsibility for the anarchy of murder, robbery, and arson which\r\nreigns in these so-called _de facto_ governments. He may be able to\r\nget this fearful burden upon his back; but if he does, I warn him of\r\nthe danger that the sands of his life will all run out before he will\r\nbe able to shake it off. He will have these piratical governments on\r\nhis hands voluntarily recognized as valid for municipal purposes until\r\nduly altered. He will have gratuitously become a copartner in the\r\nguilt which hitherto has rested upon the souls of Andrew Johnson and\r\nhis Northern and Southern satellites, but which thenceforth will rest\r\non his soul also until he can contrive duly to alter these\r\ngovernments. And so it will happen that the great Union party to which\r\nhe belongs, and to which I belong, will become implicated, for how\r\nlong a time God only knows, in this unspeakable iniquity which daily\r\nand hourly cries to Heaven from every rood of rebel soil for vengeance\r\non these monsters.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham moved to refer the two bills--that of Mr. Stevens and that\r\nof Mr. Ashley--to the Committee on Reconstruction. He opposed these\r\nbills as \"a substantial denial of the right of the great people who\r\nsaved this republic by arms to save it by fundamental law.\" He\r\nadvocated the propriety of making the proposed Constitutional\r\nAmendment the basis of reconstruction. It had already received the\r\nratification of the Legislatures representing not less than twelve\r\nmillions of the people of this nation. The fact that all the rebel\r\nStates which had considered the amendment in their Legislatures had\r\nrejected it did not invalidate this mode of reconstruction. \"Those\r\ninsurrectionary States,\" said he, \"have no power whatever as States of\r\nthis Union, and can not lawfully restrain, for a single moment, that\r\ngreat body of freemen who cover this continent from ocean to ocean,\r\nnow organized States of the Union and represented here, in their fixed\r\npurpose and undoubted legal right to incorporate the amendment into\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham maintained that Congress has the power, without\r\nrestriction by the Executive or the Supreme Court, to \"propose\r\namendments to the Constitutions, and to decide finally the question of\r\nthe ratification thereof, as well as to legislate for the nation.\" \"I\r\nlook upon both these bills,\" said Mr. Bingham, \"as a manifest\r\ndeparture from the spirit and intent of our Constitutional Amendment.\r\nI look upon it as an attempt to take away from the people of the\r\nStates lately in rebellion that protection which you have attempted to\r\nsecure to them by your Constitutional Amendment.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dawson, in a speech of an hour's duration, maintained the\r\ndoctrine, which he announced as that which had given shape to\r\npresidential policy, \"that the attempt at secession having been\r\nsuppressed by the physical power of the Government, the States, whose\r\nauthority was usurped by the parties to the movement, have never, at\r\nany time, been out of the Union; and that having once expressed their\r\nacquiescence in the result of the contest and renewed their allegiance\r\nto the Union, they are, at the same time, restored to all the rights\r\nand duties of the adhering States.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the policy of Congress, in the opinion of Mr.\r\nDawson, was \"a shameless outrage upon justice and every conservative\r\nprinciple,\"--a \"usurpation of Federal powers and a violation of State\r\nrights.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Maynard gave expression to his opinions by asking the significant\r\nquestion, \"Whether the men who went into the rebellion did not by\r\nconnecting themselves with a foreign government, by every act of which\r\nthey were capable, denude themselves of their citizenship--whether\r\nthey are not to be held and taken by this Government now as men\r\ndenuded of their citizenship, having no rights as citizens except such\r\nas the legislative power of this Government may choose to confer upon\r\nthem? In other words, is not the question on our part one of\r\nenfranchisement, not of disfranchisement?\"\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of January, Mr. Baker addressed the House in favor of\r\nreferring the pending bill to the Committee on Reconstruction. He was\r\nopposed to the use of the term \"Government,\" without qualification or\r\nrestriction, as applied to the lately revolted States. He opposed the\r\nsecond section, as causing the _de facto_ governments to become valid\r\nfor municipal purposes long before the scheme of reconstruction\r\ncontemplated by the bill is effectuated. \"To recognize them in\r\nadvance,\" said he, \"would be to incur the danger of further\r\nembarrassing the whole subject by the illogical consequences of our\r\nown illogical procedure.\"\r\n\r\nAt this stage Mr. Stevens arose and modified his substitute by\r\nwithdrawing the second section, which contained the provision objected\r\nto by Mr. Baker as well as by his \"ardent friend\" Mr. Paine. Mr. Baker\r\nobjected to that feature of the bill which provided that none should\r\nbe deprived of the right to vote as a punishment for any crime save\r\ninsurrection or treason. \"The penitentiaries of these States,\" said\r\nhe, \"might disgorge their inmates upon the polls under the operation\r\nof this bill.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Grinnell was opposed to sending the question to the Committee on\r\nReconstruction. He did not think it the most modest proposition in the\r\nworld for Mr. Bingham to urge the reference to his committee of a\r\ngreat question which, the House generally desired to consider. \"Let us\r\nhave no delay,\" said he, \"no recommitment, rather the earliest action\r\nupon this bill, as the requirement of the people who have saved the\r\ncountry, what the suffering implore, what justice demands, and what I\r\nbelieve God will approve.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is to my mind most clear,\" said Mr. Donnelly, in a speech upon the\r\npending question, \"that slavery having ceased to exist, the slaves\r\nbecame citizens; being citizens they are a part of the people, and\r\nbeing a part of the people no organization deserves a moment's\r\nconsideration at our hands which attempts to ignore them.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Southern States as under rebel rule, Mr. Donnelly remarked:\r\n\"The whites are to make the laws, execute the laws, interpret the\r\nlaws, and write the history of their own deeds; but below them; under\r\nthem, there is to be a vast population--a majority of the whole\r\npeople--seething and writhing in a condition of suffering, darkness,\r\nand wretchedness unparalleled in the world. And this is to be an\r\nAmerican State! This is to be a component part of the great, humane,\r\nChristian republic of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is hard,\" said Mr. Eldridge, in a speech against the bill, \"sad to\r\nstand silently by and see the republic overthrown. It is indeed\r\nappalling to those accustomed from early childhood to revere and love\r\nthe Constitution, to feel that it is in the keeping of those having\r\nthe power and determination to destroy it. With the passage of this\r\nbill must die every hope and vestige of the government of the\r\nConstitution. It is indeed the final breaking up and dissolution of\r\nthe union of the States by the usurpation and revolutionary act of\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your work of restoration,\" said Mr. Warner, \"will never commence\r\nuntil the Congress of the United States assumes to be one of the\r\ndepartments of the General Government. It will never commence until\r\nyou have declared, in the language of the Supreme Court, that the\r\nExecutive, as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, 'can not\r\nexercise a civil function.'\"\r\n\r\n\"In less than two brief years of office,\" said Mr. Warner, speaking of\r\nthe President, \"he has exercised more questionable powers, assumed\r\nmore doubtful constitutional functions, obliterated more\r\nconstitutional barriers, and interposed more corrupt schemes to the\r\nexpression of the popular sentiment or will of the people than all\r\nother Executives since the existence of the Government.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spalding feared that the bill, should it become a law, would be\r\nfound defective in not affording any protection to that loyal class of\r\nthe inhabitants of those communities upon whom the elective franchise\r\nwas conferred. \"These colored men,\" said he, \"who are now recognized\r\nby the Government as possessing the rights of freemen, are to be in\r\njeopardy of being shot down like so many dogs when they attempt to\r\nvisit the polls.\" He then offered an amendment, which was accepted by\r\nMr. Stevens, by which a section was added to the bill suspending the\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_ in the ten rebel States, and placing them\r\nunder martial law until they should be admitted to representation in\r\nCongress under the provisions of the bill. In this section thus\r\nintroduced may be seen the origin of that feature which, in an\r\nenlarged and extended form, gave character to the important measure\r\nultimately adopted by Congress, which is popularly known as the\r\n\"Military Reconstruction Bill.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion was continued by Mr. Koontz. \"It is a solemn,\r\nimperative duty,\" said he, \"that this nation owes to its colored\r\npeople to protect them against their own and the nation's foes. It\r\nwould be a burning, lasting disgrace to the nation were it to hand\r\nthem over to their enemies. I know of no way in which this protection\r\ncan be better given than by extending to them the elective franchise.\r\nPlace the ballot in the hands of the black man and you give him that\r\nwhich insures him respect as well as protection.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Scofield maintained that the ratification of the Constitutional\r\nAmendment by three-fourths of the loyal States was all that was\r\nnecessary. \"Twenty-three of the twenty-six States elected Legislatures\r\ninstructed to adopt it. Very soon these twenty-three States, having a\r\npopulation in 1860 of twenty-one million five hundred thousand, and\r\nnot less than twenty-seven millions now, will send to a perfidious\r\nSecretary the official evidence of the people's will. Delaware,\r\nMaryland, and Kentucky alone give a negative answer. Who, then, stands\r\nin the way? One old man who is charged by law with the duty of\r\nproclaiming the adoption of the amendment, but who has determined to\r\nincorporate into the Union the _debris_ of the late Confederacy--he\r\nstands in the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Secretary is clever in work of this kind. An English nobleman was\r\nat one time exhibiting his kennel to an American friend, and passing\r\nby many of his showiest bloods, they came upon one that seemed nearly\r\nused up. 'This,' said the nobleman, 'is the most valuable animal in\r\nthe pack, although he is old, lame, blind, and deaf.' 'How is that?'\r\ninquired the visitor. The nobleman explained: 'His education was good,\r\nto begin with, and his wonderful sense of smell is still unimpaired.\r\nWe only take him out to catch the scent, and put the puppies on the\r\ntrack, and then return him to the kennel.' Do not suppose that I\r\nintend any comparison between the Secretary of State and that veteran\r\nhunter. Such a comparison would be neither dignified nor truthful,\r\nbecause the Englishman went on to say, 'I have owned that dog for\r\nthirteen years, and, hard as he looks, he never bit the hand that fed\r\nhim nor barked on a false trail.'\"\r\n\r\nThe laughter and applause which followed, were checked by the\r\nSpeaker's gavel, which Mr. Schofield mistook for a notice to quit.\r\n\"Has my time expired?\" asked he. \"It has not,\" replied the Speaker.\r\n\"The Chair called you to order,\" said Mr. Stevens, in his seat, \"for\r\ndoing injustice to the dog.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ward, who next addressed the House, presented a novel theory of\r\nthe rebel war. \"The people of the South,\" said he, \"did not make war\r\nupon our republican form of government, nor seek to destroy it; they\r\nonly sought to make two republics out of one. They are now, and have\r\nbeen all the time, as much attached to our system of free republican\r\ngovernment as those who abuse them for disloyalty.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ward presented his view of the state of things which would result\r\nfrom the passage of the pending bill. \"These negro judges,\" said he,\r\n\"will sit and hold this election backed by the United States army.\r\nThat is rather an elevated position for the new-made freedman; the\r\n_habeas corpus_ suspended, martial law proclaimed, the army at the\r\nback of the negro conducting an election to reconstruct States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Plants addressed the House in favor of the pending bill. Of the\r\nreception given by the rebels to the proposed constitutional\r\namendment, he said: \"They have not only refused to accept the more\r\nthan generous terms proposed, but have rejected them with contumely,\r\nand with the haughty and insulting bravado of assumed superiority\r\ndemand that the nation shall submit to such terms as they shall\r\ndictate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Miller, while advocating the pending measure, favored its\r\nreference to the Committee on Reconstruction. He gave a detailed\r\naccount of the Constitutional Amendment, and its progress toward\r\nratification among the Legislatures. He showed that the progress of\r\nreconstruction was delayed through fault of the rebels themselves. \"It\r\nis not the desire of the great Republican party,\" said he, \"to retard\r\nthe restoration of those ten States to full political rights, but on\r\nthe contrary they are anxious for a speedy adjustment, in order to\r\nsecure adequate protection to all classes and conditions of men\r\nresiding therein, and at the same time afford ample security to the\r\nUnited States Government against any future refractory course that\r\nmight be pursued on the part of those States.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of January the discussion was resumed by Mr. Kerr in a\r\nspeech against the bill. He quoted extensively from judicial decisions\r\nand opinions to show that the rebel States were still entitled to\r\ntheir original rights in the Union. \"The undisguised and most\r\nunrighteous purpose of all this kind of legislation,\" said he, \"is to\r\nusurp powers over those States that can find no warrant except in the\r\nfierce will of the dominant party in this Congress. It is alike at war\r\nwith every principle of good and free government, and with the highest\r\ndictates of humanity and national fraternity.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Higby was in favor of the pending bill, and opposed its reference\r\nto the Committee on Reconstruction. He preferred that it should be\r\nretained in the House, where it could be changed, matured, and finally\r\npassed. He contended that the rebel States should not come into the\r\nUnion under any milder conditions than those imposed upon Territories\r\nrecently passed upon in Congress. \"Impartial suffrage,\" said he, \"is\r\nrequired of each of those Territories as a condition precedent to\r\ntheir becoming States; and shall South Carolina, upon this basis of\r\nreconstruction, become a part of this Union upon different terms and\r\nprinciples entirely from those implied by the votes we have just\r\ngiven?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trimble denounced the pending legislation in violent terms. \"By\r\nthis act,\" said he, \"you dissolve their connection with the Government\r\nof the United States, blot them out of existence as freemen, and\r\ndegrade them to the condition of negro commonwealths. We have this\r\nmonstrous proposition: to declare martial law in ten States of this\r\nUnion; and in making this declaration, we, in my judgment, step upon\r\nthe mangled ruins of the Constitution; for the Constitution plainly\r\ngives this power neither to the executive nor the legislative\r\ndepartment of the Government.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dodge, although a Republican, and in favor of \"protecting the best\r\ninterests of the colored man,\" could not vote for either of the\r\npropositions before the House. \"The result of the passage of this\r\nbill,\" said he, \"if it shall become operative, will be to disfranchise\r\nnearly the entire white population of the Southern States, and at the\r\nsame time enfranchise the colored people and give them the virtual\r\ncontrol in the proposed organization of the new State governments.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dodge was particularly opposed to the military feature proposed by\r\nMr. Spalding. \"This is not likely,\" said he, \"in the nature of things,\r\nto bring about an early reörganization of the South. The commercial,\r\nthe manufacturing, and the agricultural interests of this country, as\r\nthey look at this matter, will see in it a continuance of taxation\r\nnecessary to support this military array sent to these ten States.\"\r\n\r\n\"This bill, if executed,\" said Mr. Hise, in the course of a speech\r\nagainst the measure, \"will in effect establish corrupt and despotic\r\nlocal governments for all those States, and place in all the offices\r\nthe most ignorant, degraded, and corrupt portion of their population,\r\nwho would rule and ruin without honesty or skill the actual\r\nproperty-holders and native inhabitants, making insecure life,\r\nliberty, and property, and still holding those States in their Federal\r\nrelations subject to the most rapacious, fierce, and unrelenting\r\ndespotism that ever existed, that of a vindictive and hostile party\r\nmajority of a Congress in which they have no voice or representation,\r\nand by which irresponsible majority they would be mercilessly\r\noppressed for that very reason; and this will be continued, I fear,\r\nuntil the country shall again be precipitated into civil war.\"\r\n\r\nSince the \"beneficent conservative power\" of the President was\r\novercome by two-thirds of Congress, Mr. Hise could see safety for the\r\nnation in but one direction. \"Our only hope,\" said he, \"of the\r\npreservation of a free government is in the judicial department of the\r\ngovernment, and in the decisions of the Supreme Court pronouncing your\r\nacts unconstitutional and void.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond preferred the Constitutional Amendment as the basis of\r\nreconstruction, and blamed the party in power for abandoning that\r\npolicy. \"Last year,\" said he, \"that man was untrue to his party\r\nobligations who did not stand by it; this year the man is declared to\r\nbe faithless to his party who does.\"\r\n\r\nHaving spoken at considerable length against the pending measure, Mr.\r\nRaymond said: \"For these reasons, sir, reasons of policy and of\r\nauthority, I do not think we ought to pass this bill. I do not believe\r\nit would be at all effective in securing the objects at which we aim,\r\nor that it would conduce in the slightest degree to promote peace and\r\nsecure equal rights among the people upon whom it is to take effect.\r\nAnd I can not help believing that it contains provisions directly at\r\nwar with specific and peremptory prohibitions of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond defended the Secretary of State against the accusations of\r\nMr. Schofield. Mr. Seward was not \"a perfidious old man,\" but one\r\n\"venerable, not more for age than for the signal services to his\r\ncountry and the cause of freedom every-where, by which his long and\r\nlaborious life, devoted wholly, from early manhood, to the public\r\nservice, has been made illustrious.\" The Secretary of State acted\r\nunder law. If Congress expected him to act under the theory that\r\nthree-fourths of the loyal States were sufficient for the ratification\r\nof the Constitutional Amendment, they should pass a law to that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\"The man,\" said Mr. Shellabarger, \"who is now the acting President of\r\nthe United States, once said to me, in speaking of a bill like the one\r\nnow before the House, that it was a measure to dissolve the Union.\r\nThat proposition has been so often repeated by members upon the other\r\nside of this hall, that I have thought the House would probably pardon\r\nme if I should attempt to condense into a few sentences a suggestion\r\nor two in regard to that declaration, repeated so often and worn out\r\nso thoroughly as it is.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shellabarger maintained the right of governments to withhold from\r\nthose who discard all the obligations pertaining to their citizenship\r\nthe powers and rights which come alone from performing these\r\nobligations. \"This identical principle,\" said he, \"was asserted at the\r\norigin of your Government in the legislation of every one of the\r\nStates of the Confederation; was repeated and reënacted by three, at\r\nleast, of the first Congresses under the Constitution, and has been\r\nvirtually reënacted by being kept in force by every subsequent\r\nCongress which ever met under the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see such diversity of opinion on this side of the House,\" said Mr.\r\nStevens, \"upon any question of reconstruction, that, if I do not\r\nchange my mind, I shall to-morrow relieve the House from any question\r\nupon the merits of this bill by moving to lay it on the table.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of January the discussion was renewed. Mr. Ross,\r\nconsidering the argument on the constitutionality of the measure\r\nexhausted, endeavored to show that the bill was \"in clear conflict\r\nwith the action of the party in power during the entire progress of\r\nthe war, and in conflict with the clearly-expressed opinions of the\r\nExecutive of the nation, the Supreme Court, and the Congress of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ashley withdrew his amendment to Mr. Stevens' bill that the House\r\nmight, in Committee of the Whole, have an opportunity to perfect the\r\nbill so as to send it to the Senate within two or three days.\r\n\r\n\"I ask the gentleman,\" said Mr. Conkling, \"to state his objection to\r\nhaving a subject like this committed to a committee which has now no\r\nwork upon its hands, and which has a right to report at any time.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Committee on Reconstruction,\" replied Mr. Ashley, \"have held no\r\nmeetings during this entire session up to this hour. Several bills\r\nproposed by gentlemen have been referred to that committee during this\r\nsession, upon which they have taken no action. If the committee ever\r\ngets together again--which I doubt, as it is a large committee,\r\ncomposed of both branches of Congress--I have but little hope of their\r\nbeing able to agree. The chairman of the committee on the part of the\r\nSenate, as is well known, is absorbed in his efforts to perfect the\r\nfinancial measures of the country, and I fear that if this bill goes\r\nto that committee it will go to its grave, and that it will not,\r\nduring the life of the Thirty-ninth Congress, see the light. If I were\r\nopposed to these bills, I would vote to send them to that committee as\r\nsending them to their tomb.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no difficulty,\" responded Mr. Conkling, \"in having prompt\r\nconsideration of any thing which may be sent to the committee. It was\r\ncreated originally solely to deal with this subject. It was, at first,\r\nbroken into four sub-committees, that the work of gathering evidence\r\nmight be more advantageously and speedily carried on. It became one\r\ncommittee, usually working together, only during a few weeks\r\nimmediately preceding the bringing forward of its ultimate\r\npropositions. It would not be decorous for me to praise the committee\r\nor the work it did, but I may say with propriety that if it ever was a\r\ngood committee, if it ever should have been created and composed as it\r\nwas, it is a good committee now--better than it ever was before;\r\nbetter, because more familiar with this subject, because its members,\r\nhaving now become acquainted with each other's views, and having\r\nbecome accustomed to act with each other, and having studied the whole\r\nsubject committed to them, can proceed with much more hope of good\r\nresults than ever before. Having a right to report at any time, and\r\nbeing led, on the part of this House, by the distinguished gentleman\r\nfrom Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevens], I see no reason why it can not\r\nconsider and digest wisely and promptly whatever may be referred to it\r\nand make report.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are now considering a report from that very committee,\" said Mr.\r\nStevens. \"That committee made a report, and I have offered a\r\nsubstitute for the bill which they reported. If the gentleman thinks\r\nthe report of that committee is best, then let him vote against my\r\nsubstitute. But why send this subject back again to the committee? The\r\ngentleman knows as well as I do how many different opinions there are\r\nin that committee; some of us believe in one thing, and some of us in\r\nanother; some of us are very critical, and some of us are not. The\r\nidea that we can consider any thing in that committee, constituted as\r\nit is, in less than a fortnight, it seems to me is wholly out of the\r\nquestion; and as we have only about some twenty working days in which\r\nto mature this bill in both branches of Congress, if we send this\r\nsubject to that committee and let it take its time to consider it, and\r\nthen have it reported here and considered again, I certainly need not\r\nsay to gentlemen that that would be an end of the matter, at least for\r\nthis session.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman from Pennsylvania concurred in that report,\" replied\r\nMr. Conkling. \"He had his full share in molding it and making it\r\nprecisely what it was. He supported it then; now he offers a\r\nsubstitute for it. Why? Because the time which has elapsed since then,\r\nand the events which have transpired, have modified, he thinks, the\r\nexigencies of the case. Is not that as applicable to the judgment of\r\nthe committee as to his own? Is it not proper that it should have the\r\nopportunity of acting for once in the light of all the facts and\r\ncircumstances as they are to day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two or three bills on this subject,\" said Mr. Stevens, \"have been\r\nreferred during this session to that committee. Why has not the\r\ncommittee acted on them?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were the chairman of the committee on the part of this House,\"\r\nreplied Mr. Conkling, \"I should be able to answer that question,\r\nbecause then I could tell why I had not called the committee together.\r\nBut as I am only a subordinate member of the committee, whose business\r\nit is to come when I am called, and never to call others, I am\r\nentirely unable to give the information for which the gentleman\r\ninquires.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I could have any assurance,\" said Mr. Ashley, \"that this committee\r\nwould be able to report promptly a bill upon which this House could\r\nprobably agree, I would not hesitate a single moment to vote for the\r\nreference of this measure to that committee; but, believing that they\r\nwill be unable to agree, I shall vote against a recommitment.\"\r\n\r\nIn describing the character of the opposition arrayed against the\r\nCongressional plan of reconstruction, Mr. Ashley used the following\r\nemphatic language: \"Why, sir, the assumption, the brazen-faced\r\nassumption of men who during the entire war were in open or secret\r\nalliance with the rebels, coming here now and joining hands with the\r\napostate at the other end of the avenue, who is the leader, the\r\nrecognized leader of a counter-revolution--a negative rebellion, as I\r\nsaid awhile ago--passes comprehension.\"\r\n\r\n\"If intended to apply to us,\" said Mr. Winfield, speaking for the\r\nDemocratic members, \"it is a base and unfounded slander.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far as I am concerned, it is a base lie,\" said Mr. Hunter. For\r\nusing these words, \"condemned by gentlemen every-where, as well as by\r\nparliamentary law,\" the House passed a vote of censure on Mr. Hunter,\r\nand he was required to go forward and receive a public reprimand from\r\nthe Speaker.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of January, the House having resumed the consideration of\r\nthe bill to restore to the rebel States their full political rights,\r\nMr. Julian expressed his belief that the time had come for action, and\r\nthat having the great subject before them, they should proceed\r\nearnestly, and with little delay, to mature some measure which would\r\nmeet the demand of the people. \"Let us tolerate no further\r\nprocrastination,\" said he; \"and while we justly hold the President\r\nresponsible for the trouble and mal-administration which now curse the\r\nSouth and disturb the peace of the country, let us remember that the\r\nnational odium already perpetually linked with the name of Andrew\r\nJohnson will be shared by us if we fail in the great duty which is now\r\nbrought to our doors.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Julian differed with many others in his opinion of the real wants\r\nof the rebel States. \"What these regions need,\" said he, \"above all\r\nthings, is not an easy and quick return to their forfeited rights in\r\nthe Union, but _government_, the strong arm of power, outstretched\r\nfrom the central authority here in Washington, making it safe for the\r\nfreedmen of the South, safe for her loyal white men, safe for\r\nemigrants from the Old World and from the Northern States to go and\r\ndwell there; safe for Northern capital and labor, Northern energy and\r\nenterprise, and Northern ideas to set up their habitation in peace,\r\nand thus found a Christian civilization and a living democracy amid\r\nthe ruins of the past.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would seem,\" said Mr. Cullom, \"that the men who have been\r\nstruggling so hard to destroy this country were and still are the\r\ninstruments, however wicked, by which we are driven to give the black\r\nman justice, whether we will or no.\r\n\r\n\"By the unholy persistence of rebels slavery was at last overthrown.\r\nTheir contempt of the Constitutional Amendment, now before the\r\ncountry, will place in the hands of every colored man of the South the\r\nballot.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill before the House was referred to the Committee on\r\nReconstruction by a vote of eighty-eight to sixty-five.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of February, Mr. Williams, of Oregon, introduced into the\r\nSenate \"A bill to provide for the more efficient government of the\r\ninsurrectionary States,\" which was referred to the Committee on\r\nReconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Geo.

Williams, Senator from Oregon.]\r\n\r\nThis bill, having been considered by the Committee, was adopted by\r\nthem, and was reported by their chairman to the House, on the 6th of\r\nFebruary, in the following form:\r\n\r\n     \"_Whereas_, the pretended State Governments of the late\r\n     so-called Confederate States of Virginia, North Carolina,\r\n     South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana,\r\n     Florida, Texas, and Arkansas were set up without the\r\n     authority of Congress and without the sanction of the\r\n     people; and _whereas_ said pretended governments afford no\r\n     adequate protection for life or property, but countenance\r\n     and encourage lawlessness and crime; and _whereas_ it is\r\n     necessary that peace and good order should be enforced in\r\n     said so-called States until loyal and Republican State\r\n     Governments can be legally established: Therefore,\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives\r\n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled_, That\r\n     said so-called States shall be divided into military\r\n     districts and made subject to the military authority of the\r\n     United States, as hereinafter prescribed; and for that\r\n     purpose Virgina shall constitute the first district, North\r\n     Carolina and South Carolina the second district, Georgia,\r\n     Alabama, and Florida the third district, Mississippi and\r\n     Arkansas the fourth district, and Louisiana and Texas the\r\n     fifth district.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That it shall be the\r\n     duty of the General of the army to assign to the command of\r\n     each of said districts an officer of the regular army not\r\n     below the rank of brigadier general, and to detail a\r\n     sufficient force to enable such officer to perform his\r\n     duties and enforce his authority within the district to\r\n     which he is assigned.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3. _And be it further enacted_, That it shall be the\r\n     duty of each officer assigned, as aforesaid, to protect all\r\n     persons in their rights of person and property, to suppress\r\n     insurrection, disorder, and violence, and to punish, or\r\n     cause to be punished, all disturbers of the public peace and\r\n     criminals; and to this end he may allow civil tribunals to\r\n     take jurisdiction of and to try offenders, or when in his\r\n     judgment it may be necessary for the trial of offenders he\r\n     shall have power to organize military commissions or\r\n     tribunals for that purpose, any thing in the constitution\r\n     and laws of the so-called States to the contrary\r\n     notwithstanding; and all legislative or judicial proceedings\r\n     or processes to prevent the trial or proceedings of such\r\n     tribunals, and all interference by said pretended State\r\n     governments with the exercise of military authority under\r\n     this act shall be void and of no effect.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4. _And be it further enacted_, That courts and\r\n     judicial officers of the United States shall not issue writs\r\n     of _habeas corpus_ in behalf of persons in military custody\r\n     unless some commissioned officer on duty in the district\r\n     wherein the person is detained shall indorse upon said\r\n     petition a statement certifying upon honor that he has\r\n     knowledge or information as to the cause and circumstances\r\n     of the alleged detention, and that he believes the same to\r\n     be rightful; and further, that he believes that the indorsed\r\n     petition is preferred in good faith and in furtherance of\r\n     justice, and not to hinder or delay the punishment of crime.\r\n     All persons put under military arrest, by virtue of this\r\n     act, shall be tried without unnecessary delay, and no cruel\r\n     or unusual punishment shall be inflicted.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5. _And be it further enacted_, That no sentence of\r\n     any military commission or tribunal hereby authorized,\r\n     affecting the life or liberty of any person, shall be\r\n     executed until it is approved by the officer in command of\r\n     the district; and the laws and regulations for the\r\n     government of the army shall not be affected by this act,\r\n     except in so far as they conflict with its provisions.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens, having been remonstrated with by a Democratic member for\r\nexpressing a wish to bring the question to vote without a prolonged\r\ndebate, replied: \"I am very willing that the debate which has been\r\ngoing on here for three weeks shall all be read over by the gentleman\r\nwhenever he can take time to read it.\" \"On behalf of the American\r\npeople,\" said the same member, \"I ask more time for debate.\" \"I will\r\nsee what the American people think of it in the morning. If they are\r\ngenerally for a prolongation of the debate, of course I will go with\r\nthem. But I will wait until then, in order to ascertain what the\r\npeople want.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day, February 7th, Mr. Stevens introduced the\r\ndiscussion with a brief speech. \"This bill provides,\" said he, that\r\n\"the ten disorganized States shall be divided into five military\r\ndistricts, and that the commander of the army shall take charge of\r\nthem through his lieutenants as governors, or you may call them\r\ncommandants if you choose, not below the grade of brigadiers, who\r\nshall have the general supervision of the peace, quiet, and the\r\nprotection of the people, loyal and disloyal, who reside within those\r\nprecincts; and that to do so he may use, as the law of nations would\r\nauthorize him to do, the legal tribunals where-ever he may deem them\r\ncompetent; but they are to be considered of no validity _per se_, of\r\nno intrinsic force, no force in consequence of their origin, the\r\nquestion being wholly within the power of the conqueror, and to remain\r\nuntil that conqueror shall permanently supply their place with\r\nsomething else. I will say, in brief, that is the whole bill. It does\r\nnot need much examination. One night's rest after its reading is\r\nenough to digest it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of all the various plans,\" said Mr. Brandegee, \"which have been\r\ndiscussed in this hall for the past two years, to my mind it seems the\r\nplainest, the most appropriate, the freest from constitutional\r\nobjection, and the best calculated to accomplish the master aims of\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\n\"It begins the work of reconstruction at the right end, and employs\r\nthe right tools for its accomplishment. It begins at the point where\r\nGrant left off the work, at Appomattox Court-house, and it holds those\r\nrevolted communities in the grasp of war until the rebellion shall\r\nhave laid down its spirit, as two years ago it formally laid down its\r\narms.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Le Blond characterized the Committee on Reconstruction as \"the\r\nmaelstrom committee, which swallows up every thing that is good and\r\ngives out every thing that is evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing left,\" said he, in the conclusion of his speech,\r\n\"but quiet submission to your tyranny, or a resort to arms on the part\r\nof the American people to defend themselves.\r\n\r\n\"I do not desire war; but as one American citizen, I do prefer war to\r\ncowardly submission and total destruction of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of our Government. In my honest conviction, nothing but the\r\nstrong arm of the American people, wielded upon the bloody\r\nbattle-field, will ever restore civil liberty to the American people\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible,\" said Mr. Finck, \"that in this Congress we can find\r\nmen bold enough and bad enough to conspire against the right of trial\r\nby jury, the great privilege of _habeas corpus_; men who are willing\r\nto reverse the axiom that the military should be subordinate to the\r\ncivil power, and to establish the abhorred doctrine resisted by the\r\nbrave and free men of every age, that the military should be superior\r\nto the civil authority?\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not seem to me,\" said Mr. Pike, \"that the change proposed to\r\nbe made by this bill in the management of the Southern States is so\r\nviolent as gentlemen on the other side would have us suppose. They\r\nseem to believe that now the people of those States govern themselves;\r\nbut the truth is, since the suppression of the rebellion, that is,\r\nsince the surrender of the rebel armies in 1865, the government of\r\nthose States have been virtually in the hands of the President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"This bill does not transfer the government of those States from the\r\npeople to the officers of the army, but only from the President to\r\nthose officers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Farnsworth, who next addressed the House, gave numerous\r\nauthenticated instances of outrages and murders perpetrated by rebels\r\nupon Union soldiers and citizens. \"It is no longer a question of\r\ndoubt,\" said he, \"it can not be denied that the loyal men, the Union\r\nsoldiers and the freedmen in these disorganized and disloyal States\r\nare not protected. They are murdered with impunity; they are despoiled\r\nof their goods and their property; they are banished, scattered,\r\ndriven from the country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers denounced the pending bill in most emphatic language. \"You\r\nwill carry this conflict on,\" said he, \"until you bring about a war\r\nthat will shake this country as with the throes of an earthquake; a\r\nwar that will cause the whole civilized world to witness our dreadful\r\nshock and fill nature with agony in all her parts, with which the one\r\nwe have passed through is not at all to be compared.\"\r\n\r\nHe eulogized President Johnson in the highest terms. \"Free\r\ngovernment,\" said he, \"brought him from a poor boy to as great a man\r\nas ever lived, and he deserves as much credit as Washington and will\r\nyet receive it. He will not submit to have the citadel of liberty\r\ninvaded and destroyed without using the civil and military powers to\r\nprevent it. He will maintain the Constitution, sir, even to the\r\nspilling of blood.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham proposed to amend the bill to make it accord with his\r\ntheory by substituting the phrase \"the said States\" for the words\r\n\"so-called States.\" He also proposed some limitation of the extent to\r\nwhich the _habeas corpus_ should be suspended. \"When these men,\" said\r\nhe, \"shall have fulfilled their obligations\" and when the great people\r\nthemselves shall have put, by their own rightful authority, into the\r\nfundamental law the sublime decree, the nation's will, that no State\r\nshall deny to any mortal man the equal protection of the laws--not of\r\nthe laws of South Carolina alone, but of the laws national and State,\r\nand above all, sir, of the great law, the Constitution of our own\r\ncountry, which is the supreme law of the land, from Georgia to Oregon,\r\nand from Maine to Florida--then, sir, by assenting thereto those\r\nStates may be restored at once. To that end, sir, I labor and for that\r\nI strive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless the population of these States,\" said Mr. Lawrence, \"is to be\r\nleft to the merciless rule of the rebels, who employ the color of\r\nauthority they exercise under illegal but _de facto_ State governments\r\nto oppress all who are loyal without furnishing them any protection\r\nagainst murder and all the wrongs that rebels can inflict on loyal\r\nmen, we can not, dare not refuse to pass this bill.\"\r\n\r\nSince, however, the bill did not propose any \"plan of reörganizing\r\nState governments in the late rebel States,\" Mr. Lawrence read\r\namendments which he desired to introduce at the proper time, providing\r\nthat the laws of the District of Columbia, \"not locally inapplicable,\"\r\nshould be in force in the rebel territory and that the United States\r\ncourts should have jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nMr. Hise declared this a \"stupid, cruel, unwise, and unconstitutional\r\nmeasure.\" \"If I had not been prepared,\" said he, \"by other measures\r\nhitherto adopted and others hitherto introduced into this House, I\r\nshould not have been less startled at the introduction of this than if\r\nI had received the sudden intelligence that the ten States enumerated\r\nin this bill had been sunk by some great convulsion of nature and\r\nsubmerged under an oceanic deluge.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not, strictly speaking, a measure of reconstruction,\" said\r\nMr. Ingersoll, \"but a measure looking simply to the enforcement of\r\norder. It seems to me clear, then, that, not only under the laws of\r\nwar and under the laws of nations, but under the express authority of\r\nthe Constitution itself, Congress possesses the rightful authority to\r\nestablish military governments, as proposed by the bill under\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to Mr. Le Blond's anticipated war, Mr. Ingersoll said: \"I\r\ndesire to ask the gentleman where he is going to get his soldiers to\r\nmake war upon the Government and the Congress of the United States?\r\nYou will hardly find them in the rebel States. They have had enough of\r\nwar; they have been thoroughly whipped, and do not desire to be\r\nwhipped again. You will not get them from the loyal people of the\r\nNorthern or Southern States. If you get any at all, you may drum up a\r\nfew recruits from the Democratic ranks, but in the present weak and\r\nshattered condition of that party you would hardly be able to raise a\r\nvery formidable army, and I tell the gentleman if the party decreases\r\nin the same ratio in the coming year as it has in the last, the whole\r\nparty together would not form a respectable _corps d'armée_.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the bread and butter brigade?\" interposed a member.\r\n\r\n\"I did not think of that heroic and patriotic band,\" replied Mr.\r\nIngersoll, \"but I do not apprehend much danger from that source; it\r\nwould be a bloodless conflict; we would have no use either for the\r\nsword or musket; all that would be necessary to make a conquest over\r\nthem would be found in the commissary department. Order out the bread\r\nand butter and peace would be restored.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shanklin warned the House of the danger of establishing military\r\ngovernments in the South. \"You may be in the plenitude of power\r\nto-day,\" he said, in conclusion, \"and you may be ousted to-morrow. And\r\nI hope, if you do not cease these outrages upon the people of the\r\ncountry, such as you propose here, such as are attempting to be\r\ninflicted by your Freedmen's Bureau and your Civil Rights Bills, that\r\nthe time will not be long before that army which the gentleman from\r\nIllinois [Mr. Ingersoll] seemed to think could not be raised--an army\r\narmed with ballots, and not with bayonet--will march to the polls and\r\nhurl the advocates of this and its kindred measures out of their\r\nplaces, and fill them with men who appreciate more highly and justly\r\nthe rights of citizens and of freemen, with statesmen whose minds can\r\ngrasp our whole country and its rights and its wants, and whose hearts\r\nare in sympathy with the noble, the brave, and the just, whether they\r\nlive in the sunny South or the ice-bound regions of the North.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hail this measure,\" said Mr. Thayer, \"as interrupting this baleful\r\ncalm, which, if not disturbed by a proper exercise of legislative\r\npower upon this subject, may be succeeded by disaster and collision.\r\nIt furnishes at least an initial point from which we can start in the\r\nconsideration and adjustment of the great question of reconstruction.\r\nI regard this as a measure which lays the grasp of Congress upon this\r\ngreat question--a grasp which is to hold on to it until it shall be\r\nfinally settled. I regard it as a measure which is to take that great\r\nquestion out of that sea of embarrassment and sluggish inactivity in\r\nwhich, through the course which the President has thought proper to\r\npursue, it now rests.\"\r\n\r\n\"For our neglect,\" said Mr. Harding, of Illinois, \"to exert the\r\nmilitary power of the Government, we are responsible for the blood and\r\nsuffering which disgrace this republic. Let us go back, then, or\r\nrather let us come up to where we were before, and exercise\r\njurisdiction over the territory conquered from the rebels, which\r\njurisdiction the President has given up to those rebels, to the great\r\nsuffering and injury of the Government and of loyal people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it be remembered all the time,\" said Mr. Shellabarger, \"that your\r\ncountry has a right to its life, and that the powers of your\r\nGovernment are given for its preservation. Let it be remembered that\r\none portion of your republic has fallen into a state of rebellion, and\r\nis still in a state of war against your Government, and that the\r\npowers of the Government are to be exercised for the purposes of the\r\nprotection and the defense of the loyal, and the disloyal too, in that\r\npart of the republic; and that, for the purpose of that defense, you\r\nare authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_, and to exercise such extraordinary powers as are necessary to\r\nthe preservation of the great life of the nation. Let these things be\r\nremembered; and then let it also be remembered that the law-making\r\npower of the Government not only controls the President, but controls\r\nthe purposes and the ends and the objects of war, and, of course, the\r\nmovements of the armies that are to be employed in war. Let these\r\nthings be remembered, and it seems to me that all the difficulties\r\nwith which it is sought to surround this measure will at once\r\ndisappear.\"\r\n\r\n\"What carried our elections overwhelmingly?\" asked Mr. Hotchkiss. \"It\r\nwas the story of the Southern refugees told to the people of the North\r\nand the West. They told us they demanded protection. They enlisted the\r\nsympathy of Northern soldiers by telling that the very guerrillas who\r\nhung upon the skirts of our army during the war were now murdering\r\nSouthern soldiers who fought on the Union side, and murdering peaceful\r\ncitizens, murdering black men who were our allies. We promised the\r\npeople if we were indorsed we would come back here and protect them,\r\nand yet not a step has been taken.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Griswold regretted to vote against a measure proposed by those\r\nwhom he believed to \"have at heart the best interest of the whole\r\ncountry.\" \"It seems to me,\" said he, \"that the provisions of this bill\r\nwill lead us into greater danger than is justified by the evils we\r\nseek to correct. It is, Mr. Speaker, a tremendous stride that we\r\npropose to make by this bill to subject to military control ten\r\nmillion people who have once been partners of this common country, and\r\nwho are to be united with us in its future trials and fortunes. This\r\nbill proposes to place all the rights of life, liberty, and happiness\r\nexclusively in the control of a mere military captain. This bill\r\ncontains no provisions for the establishment in the future of civil\r\ngovernments there; it simply provides that for an indefinite period in\r\nthe future a purely military power shall have exclusive control and\r\njurisdiction there. That is, therefore, to me, another and a very\r\nserious objection to this bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a necessity,\" said Mr. Raymond, \"for some measure of\r\nprotection to the people of the Southern States. I think it is clear\r\nthat life, liberty, and property are not properly guarded by law, are\r\nnot safe throughout those Southern States. They are not properly\r\nprotected by the courts and judicial tribunals of those States; they\r\nare not properly protected by the civil authorities that are in\r\npossession of political power in those States.\"\r\n\r\nOf the pending bill, he said: \"It is a simple abnegation of all\r\nattempts for the time to protect the people in the Southern States by\r\nthe ordinary exercise of civil authority. It hands over all authority\r\nin those States to officers of the army of the United States, and\r\nclothes them as officers of the army with complete, absolute,\r\nunrestricted power to administer the affairs of those States according\r\nto their sovereign will and pleasure. In my opinion there has not\r\noccurred an emergency which justifies a resort to this extreme remedy.\r\nThe military force ought to follow the civil authority, and not lead\r\nit, not take its place, not supersede it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must compel obedience to the Union,\" said Mr. Garfield, \"and\r\ndemand protection for its humblest citizen wherever the flag floats.\r\nWe must so exert the power of the nation that it shall be deemed both\r\nsafe and honorable to have been loyal in the midst of treason. We must\r\nsee to it that the frightful carnival of blood now raging in the\r\nSouth, shall continue no longer. The time has come when we must lay\r\nthe heavy hand of military authority upon these rebel communities and\r\nhold them in its grasp till their madness is past.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens having expressed a wish to have an immediate vote, Mr.\r\nBanks remarked: \"I believe that a day or two devoted to a discussion\r\nof this subject of the reconstruction of the Government will bring us\r\nto a solution in which the two houses of Congress will agree, in which\r\nthe people of this country will sustain us, and in which the President\r\nof the United States will give us his support.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not the advantage,\" replied Mr. Stevens, \"of the secret\r\nnegotiations which the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr.\r\nBanks] has, and from which he seems to expect such perfect harmony\r\nbetween the President and the Congress of the United States--within a\r\nfew days. If I had that advantage, I do not know what effect it might\r\nhave upon me. Not having it, I can not, of course, act upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the remarks which I made,\" said Mr. Banks, \"I made no allusion to\r\nany negotiations with the President. I have had no negotiations with\r\nthe President of the United States, nor do I know his opinions, and in\r\nthe vote which I shall give upon this question, neither the gentleman\r\nfrom Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevens] nor any other man has the right to\r\nassume that I accept the policy of the Executive in the smallest\r\nparticular. I hope for a change of his position; I think that it is\r\nnot impossible. At all events, I think it is something which is worth\r\nour while to try for.\"\r\n\r\nThe previous question was moved by Mr. Stevens; but a majority\r\nrefusing to second the motion, the discussion was continued.\r\n\r\nMr. Kasson denied the existence of a right in Congress \"to establish a\r\nmilitary government over people who have been in insurrection.\" He\r\nproposed as a substitute for the pending measure \"A bill to establish\r\nan additional article of war for the more complete suppression of the\r\ninsurrection against the United States.\" This provided for a division\r\nof the rebel territory into military districts, as did the original\r\nbill, and authorized commanders to declare martial law wherever it\r\nshould be necessary for the \"complete suppression of violence and\r\ndisorder.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ashley moved an amendment providing for the restoration to loyal\r\nowners of property confiscated by the rebel government, and providing\r\nthat military government should cease so soon as the people of the\r\nrebel States should adopt State constitutions securing to all citizens\r\nequal protection of the laws, including the right of the elective\r\nfranchise, and should ratify the proposed amendment to the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond thought that, on account of the great diversity of\r\nopinion, the whole subject should be referred to a select committee,\r\nwho should be instructed to report within three or four days a bill\r\nwhich should \"provide temporarily for the protection of rights and the\r\npreservation of the peace in the States lately in rebellion, and also\r\nfor the speedy admission of those States to their relations in the\r\nUnion upon the basis of the Constitutional Amendment.\" Thus he hoped a\r\nresult could be reached which \"would command the support of Congress\r\nand of the country, and the approval, or at least the assent, of the\r\nExecutive.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell remarked that previous propositions having been referred\r\nto the Committee on Reconstruction, they had agreed upon the bill\r\nbefore the House with a unanimity which no other report had ever\r\nobtained, nor had any bill submitted by that committee ever been so\r\ncarefully considered as this. \"To-day,\" said he, \"there are eight\r\nmillions and more of people, occupying six hundred and thirty thousand\r\nsquare miles of the territory of this country, who are writhing under\r\ncruelties nameless in their character--injustice such as has not been\r\npermitted to exist in any other country in modern times; and all this\r\nbecause in this capital there sits enthroned a man who, so far as the\r\nexecutive department is concerned, guides the destinies of the\r\nrepublic in the interest of rebels; and because, also, in those ten\r\nformer States rebellion itself, inspired by the executive department\r\nof this Government, wields all authority, and is the embodiment of law\r\nand power every-where. Until in the South this obstacle to\r\nreconstruction is removed, there can be no effectual step taken toward\r\nthe reörganization of the Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"A well man needs no remedies,\" said Mr. Niblack, in a speech against\r\nthe bill; \"it is only when he is sick that you can require him to\r\nsubmit to medicinal applications. A country at peace does not need and\r\nought not to allow martial law and other summary remedies incident to\r\na state of war. The highest and dearest interests of this country are\r\nmade subordinate to party exigencies and to special and particular\r\ninterests. No wonder, then, that trade languishes and commerce\r\ndeclines.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of February, Mr. Bingham proposed an amendment making the\r\nrestoration of the rebel States conditional upon their adoption of the\r\nConstitutional Amendment, and imposing upon them, meanwhile, the\r\nmilitary government provided by the pending bill.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelley advocated the bill as reported from the committee. \"This,\"\r\nsaid he, \"is little more than a mere police bill. The necessity for it\r\narises from the perfidy of the President of the United States. Had he\r\nbeen true to the duties of his high office and his public and repeated\r\npledges, there would have been no necessity for considering such a\r\nbill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throughout the region of the unreconstructed States,\" said Mr.\r\nMaynard, \"the animating, life-giving principle of the rebellion is as\r\nthoroughly in possession of the country and of all the political power\r\nthere to-day as it ever has been since the first gun was fired upon\r\nFort Sumter. The rebellion is alive. It is strong--strong in the\r\nnumber of its votaries, strong in its social influences, strong in its\r\npolitical power, strong in the belief that the executive department of\r\nthis Government is in sympathy and community of purpose with them,\r\nstrong in the belief that the controlling majority of the supreme\r\njudiciary of the land is with them in legal opinion, strong in the\r\nbelief that the controversy in this body between impracticable zeal\r\nand incorrigible timidity will prevent any thing of importance being\r\naccomplished or any legislation matured.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" said Mr. Allison, \"because of the interference of the\r\nPresident of the United States with the military law which exists in\r\nthose States that this bill is rendered necessary. In my judgment, if\r\nwe had to-day an Executive who was desirous of enforcing the laws of\r\nthe United States to protect loyal men in those States, instead of\r\ndefending the rebel element, this bill would not be needed.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine submitted an amendment providing that any one of the \"late\r\nso-called Confederate States\" might be restored to representation and\r\nrelieved of military rule when, in addition to having accepted the\r\nConstitutional Amendment, it should have conferred the elective\r\nfranchise impartially upon all male citizens over twenty-one years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine maintained that the people in the elections of 1866 had\r\ndeclared in favor of \"universal, or, at least, impartial suffrage as\r\nthe basis of restoration.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of February the discussion was continued. \"That the spirit\r\nof rebellion still lives,\" said Mr. Van Horn, of New York, \"and now\r\nthrives in the South no sane man can deny; that the determination\r\nexists to make their rebellion honorable and the loyalty of the South\r\na lasting disgrace and a permanent badge of dishonor is equally true\r\nand can not be denied. The leaders of the rebellion, being in power in\r\nall the ten States unreconstructed, still defy the authority of the\r\nUnited States to a great extent, and deny the-power of the loyal\r\nmillions of the country, who have saved our nation's life against\r\ntheir treason and rebellion, to prescribe terms of settlement of this\r\ngreat controversy, and deny also that they have lost any rights they\r\nhad before the war or committed any treason against the Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe measure before the House, as it came from the Committee on\r\nReconstruction, \"was not intended as a reconstruction bill,\" according\r\nto the interpretation of Mr. Stevens. \"It was intended simply as a\r\npolice bill to protect the loyal men from anarchy and murder, until\r\nthis Congress, taking a little more time, can suit gentlemen in a bill\r\nfor the admission of all those rebel States upon the basis of civil\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThe various amendments proposed were designed by their authors to add\r\na plan of reconstruction to the pending bill. Of these Mr. Boutwell\r\nremarked: \"Without examining into the details of the amendments, I\r\nhave this to say, that any general proposition for the restoration of\r\nthese States to the Union upon any basis not set forth in an act of\r\nCongress is fraught with the greatest danger to future peace and\r\nprosperity of the republic.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendments of Mr. Bingham and Mr. Blaine were finally combined by\r\ntheir authors. The combination made an amendment providing that the\r\n\"States lately in insurrection\" should be restored and relieved of\r\nmilitary rule upon their ratification of the Constitutional Amendment\r\nand adoption of impartial suffrage. In order to \"disentangle what\r\nseemed so much entangled,\" it was moved that the bill be recommitted\r\nto the Judiciary Committee, with instructions to report back\r\nimmediately the amendment of Messrs. Blaine and Bingham.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens then addressed the House, premising that in his state of\r\nhealth a few words must suffice. He felt a moral depression in viewing\r\nthe condition of the party responsible for the doings of Congress.\r\n\"For the last few months,\" said he, \"Congress has been sitting here,\r\nand while the South has been bleeding at every pore, Congress has done\r\nnothing to protect the loyal people there, white or black, either in\r\ntheir persons, in their liberty, or in their property.\"\r\n\r\nOf his previous bill, which had been consigned to its tomb in being\r\nreferred to the Committee on Reconstruction, Mr. Stevens said: \"I\r\nthought it was a good bill; I had labored upon it in conjunction with\r\nseveral committees of loyal men from the South for four months; I had\r\naltered and realtered it, written and rewritten it four several times,\r\nand found that it met the approbation of numerous societies and\r\nmeetings in all the Southern States. It was, therefore, not altogether\r\nmy fault if it was not so good a bill as might be found; but I did\r\nthink that, after all, it was uncivil, unjust, indecent not to attempt\r\nto amend it and make it better, to see whether we could do something\r\nto enable our friends in the Southern States to establish institutions\r\naccording to the principles of republican government.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens deprecated a disposition among his friends to be\r\nhypercritical in relation to mere verbal details. \"If I might presume\r\nupon my age,\" said he, \"without claiming any of the wisdom of Nestor,\r\nI would suggest to the young gentlemen around me that the deeds of\r\nthis burning crisis, of this solemn day, of this thrilling moment,\r\nwill cast their shadows far into the future and will make their\r\nimpress upon the annals of our history, and that we shall appear upon\r\nthe bright pages of that history just in so far as we cordially,\r\nwithout guile, without bickering, without small criticisms, lend our\r\naid to promote the great cause of humanity and universal liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe question being taken on the motion to refer to the Committee on\r\nthe Judiciary, it was decided in the negative--yeas, 69; nays, 94. The\r\nquestion was then taken on the passage of the bill. It passed the\r\nHouse--one hundred and nine voting in the affirmative, and fifty-five\r\nin the negative.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to inquire, Mr. Speaker,\" said Mr. Stevens, \"if it is in order\r\nfor me now to say that we indorse the language of good old Laertes,\r\nthat Heaven rules as yet, and there are gods above.\"\r\n\r\nAt the evening session of the Senate on the same day, the bill \"to\r\nprovide for the more efficient government of the insurrectionary\r\nStates\" was announced as having passed the House, and at once received\r\nits first reading. Mr. Williams gave notice of his intention to\r\npropose an amendment, but on the following day, when the Senate\r\nproceeded to consider the subject, he said that being impressed with\r\nthe necessity of the passage of the bill, and fearing that any\r\namendment might endanger if not defeat it, he had concluded not to\r\npresent his amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson said that the adoption of the amendment would make the\r\nbill much less objectionable to him, although he could not vote for it\r\neven if amended. He then offered the amendment, which was\r\nsubstantially the same as that proposed by Messrs. Bingham and Blaine\r\nin the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nMr. Stewart regretted that the Senator from Oregon had changed his\r\nmind in regard to this amendment. \"The military bill without that,\"\r\nsaid he, \"is an acknowledgment that, after two years of discussion and\r\nearnest thought, we are unable to reconstruct, and are compelled to\r\nturn the matter over to the military. It seems to me that the people\r\nof the United States want and demand something more than a military\r\ngovernment for the South.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral Senators thought Mr. Stewart was unnecessarily troubled about\r\nmilitary governments in the South. \"Are we,\" asked Mr. Morrill, \"who\r\nhave stood here for five long, bloody years, and witnessed the\r\nexercise of military power over these rebel States, to be frightened\r\nnow by a declaration of that sort? That is not the temper in which I\r\nfind myself to-day. I have got so accustomed, if you please, to the\r\nexercise of this authority----\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the trouble,\" said Mr. Stewart.\r\n\r\n\"That has not been our trouble that we have exercised power,\" said Mr.\r\nMorrill; \"that has been the salvation of the nation. The trouble has\r\nbeen from the hesitation to exercise authority when authority was\r\nrequired.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson thought that the wisest course would be to pass the bill\r\njust as it came from the House. If it was to be amended at all, he\r\nwould propose an amendment that all citizens should \"equally possess\r\nthe right to pursue all lawful avocations and receive the equal\r\nbenefits of the public schools.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the amendments,\" said Mr. Howard, \"entirely incompatible with\r\nthe scheme and provisions of the bill itself, and that gentlemen will\r\ndiscover that incompatibility on looking into it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson thought that the remedy proposed by him long before\r\nwould be found the only cure for the ills of the nation. \"I offered,\"\r\nsaid he, \"twelve months ago, a proposition, as a constitutional\r\namendment, that was to give political rights to the negroes. Some\r\nSenators said it was a humbug, that it was Jacob Townsend's\r\nSarsaparilla, or some thing to that effect, that it would amount to\r\nnothing. Now, I will ask what other protection can you give to a Union\r\nman in the Southern States than the ballot?\"\r\n\r\nSince the bill must be passed both Houses and go to the President by\r\nthe following Tuesday, in order to give Congress time to pass it over\r\nhis veto, Mr. Williams, who had the bill in charge, was desirous of\r\nhaving it passed upon in the Senate on the evening of the day of this\r\ndiscussion, February 15th. Several Senators protested against this as\r\nunreasonable haste. \"It is extraordinary,\" said Mr. Doolittle, \"that a\r\nbill of this kind, that proposes to establish a military despotism\r\nover eight million people and a country larger than England, France,\r\nand Spain combined, is to be pressed to a vote in this Senate the\r\nfirst day it is taken up for consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the measure will not bear argument,\" said Mr. Hendricks, \"then let\r\nit be passed in the dark hours of the night. I think it is becoming,\r\nwhen despotism is established in this free land, that the best blood\r\nthat ever ran in mortal veins was shed to make free, that that\r\ndespotism shall be established when the sun does not shed its bright\r\nlight upon the earth. It is a work for darkness and not for light.\"\r\n\r\n\"He talks about establishing a despotism,\" said Mr. Henderson, \"and\r\ngets into a perfect fret about it. Why, sir, the Southern States have\r\npresented nothing but a despotism for the last six years. During the\r\nrebel rule it was a despotism, the veriest despotism ever established\r\nupon earth; and since the rebel rule ceased, the President of the\r\nUnited States certainly has governed the Southern States without ever\r\nconsulting Congress on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate held an evening session for the consideration of this bill.\r\nMr. Hendricks proposed to modify the pending amendment so as to\r\nprovide for impartial rather than universal suffrage. He thought that\r\nStates should be allowed to limit suffrage. Mr. Saulsbury would not\r\nvote for this amendment because he was unwilling to \"touch, taste, or\r\nhandle the unclean thing.\" On the other hand, Mr. Davis could vote for\r\nit because he preferred a \"little unclean thing\" to \"a big one.\" Mr.\r\nHendricks finally withdrew his amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle hoped that the majority would seriously weigh this\r\nquestion because on it might depend whether the people of the South\r\nwould accept the Constitutional Amendment, and accept the proposition\r\nnecessary to get rid of military despotism.\r\n\r\n\"Make them,\" said Mr. Wilson.\r\n\r\n\"I ask,\" said Mr. Doolittle, \"if that is the true language of a\r\nstatesman, to say to a people who have been educated in the largest\r\nliberty, a people in whose veins the Anglo-Saxon blood is flowing,\r\nwhich for a thousand years has been fighting against despotism of\r\nevery form, 'You must accept this position at the point of the\r\nbayonet, or forever live with the bayonet at your throats?' Is that\r\nthe way to make peace?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is statesmanship,\" replied Mr. Wilson, \"to settle this\r\nquestion of reconstruction upon the solid basis of the perfect\r\nequality of rights and privileges among citizens of the United States.\r\nColored men are citizens, and they have just as much right as this\r\nrace whose blood has been fighting against oppression for a thousand\r\nyears, as he says, and any settlement of this civil war upon any other\r\nbasis than perfect equality of rights and privileges among citizens of\r\nthe United States is not statesmanship; it is mere trifling; only\r\nkeeping open questions for future controversy. Nothing is settled\r\nunless it is settled upon the basis of justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall vote for this amendment,\" said Mr. Lane, \"believing that it\r\nis necessary to make a perfect system for the restoration of the\r\nlately rebellious States.\"\r\n\r\n\"The amendment,\" said Mr. Johnson, \"is objectionable to me only upon\r\nthe ground that it denies to those States the right of coming into the\r\nUnion entitled to representation until they extend the suffrage,\r\nbecause I believe the right of suffrage is a matter with which the\r\nCongress of the United States has no concern.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know perfectly well,\" said Mr. Buckalew, \"that a vote for this\r\namendment, although given under circumstances which do not commit me\r\nto the proposition as a final one, will be misunderstood and\r\nperverted. It will be said throughout the country of each of those who\r\nstand in the position in which I stand, that we have departed, to some\r\nextent at least, from that position which we have hitherto maintained,\r\nand maintained against all the influences of the time, against the\r\npressure of circumstances which have swept many from our side and\r\ncarried them into the large and swollen camp of the majority. Sir, I\r\nfor one am ambitious of being known as one among that number of men\r\nwho have kept their faith, who have followed their convictions, who\r\nhave obeyed the dictation of duty in the worst of times, who did not\r\nbend when the storm beat hardest and strongest against them, but kept\r\ntheir honor unsullied, their faith intact, their self-respect unbroken\r\nand entire.\"\r\n\r\n\"My object is,\" said Mr. Henderson, when proposing to modify the\r\npending amendment, \"to secure the franchise, and after that is\r\nsecured, to go forward and establish civil governments in the Southern\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nExtended arguments against the measure were made by Mr. Johnson and\r\nMr. Hendricks. At twelve o'clock the minority desired to adjourn, and\r\nthe friends of the measure would have been willing to do so could an\r\nunderstanding have been had as to an hour on the following day when\r\nthe vote would be taken.\r\n\r\nMr. McDougall would submit to no such-limitation upon free speech. \"I\r\ndo not expect myself,\" said he, \"to speak at any great length, but yet\r\nif upon careful consideration I should choose to do so, or if\r\npossessing the recollections of past times and memories and reasons\r\nand considerations that yet lay in my hidden memories I shall choose\r\nto talk for a longer period, I shall claim the right to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am anxious to give my views on this subject,\" said Mr. Davis. \"I do\r\nnot feel able to give them at this late hour of the night; still, I\r\nbelieve I could hang on for three or four hours if I was disposed to\r\ndo so, [laughter,] but I believe that to-morrow I should not occupy\r\nmore than at the farthest two hours of the time of the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nNumerous amendments were proposed, much discursive talk was indulged\r\nin, and many motions to adjourn were voted down. At length, three\r\no'clock of Saturday morning, February 16th, having arrived, an\r\nadjournment was brought about by means of a very long amendment\r\nproposed by Mr. Henderson as a substitute for the entire bill. This\r\nopening up a new discussion, the friends of the pending bill saw the\r\nimpossibility of coming to a speedy vote, and consented to an\r\nadjournment.\r\n\r\nOn the reässembling of the Senate on Saturday, February 16th, Mr.\r\nDoolittle delivered a very long speech in opposition to the bill, and\r\nin vindication of his political course which had been called in\r\nquestion by the \"Radicals of Wisconsin.\" \"I rise,\" said he, \"to plead\r\nfor what I believe to be the life of the republic, and for that spirit\r\nwhich gives it life. I stand here, also, to answer for myself;\r\nbecause, foreseeing and resisting from the beginning what I knew must\r\nfollow as the logical consequences of the adoption of certain\r\nfundamental heresies originating in Massachusetts, and of which the\r\nhonorable Senator upon my right [Mr. Sumner] is the advocate and\r\nchampion, I have been for more than eighteen months denounced in my\r\nState by many of my former political associates and friends.\"\r\n\r\nAt the evening session of the Senate, Mr. Saulsbury and Mr. Davis\r\ndelivered extended speeches against the measure. \"I appeal to you,\r\nsir,\" said Mr. Saulsbury; \"I appeal to those who exercise political\r\npower in this country now, by all the memories that cluster around the\r\nglorious past; by the recollection of the noble deeds and heroic\r\nsufferings of our ancestors, for you and for me, for your posterity\r\nand for my posterity; by all the bright realizations which might be\r\nours in this present hour; by all the bright future and all the\r\nglories which are in that immediate future, stop your aggressions upon\r\nthe Constitution of your country.\"\r\n\r\nThe vote having been taken on the amendment proposed by Mr. Johnson\r\nand the substitute of Mr. Henderson, they were both rejected.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman then offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute,\r\nthe preamble of which declared that \"No legal State governments or\r\nadequate protection for life or property now exist in the rebel\r\nStates.\" It retained the military feature of the original bill, with\r\nthe modification that the President, instead of the General of the\r\narmy, should appoint district commanders. The most important part of\r\nthe amendment was a plan of reconstruction, which added a new section\r\nto the bill in the following form:\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5. _And be it further enacted_, That when the people\r\n     of any one of said rebel States shall have formed a\r\n     Constitution of government in conformity with the\r\n     Constitution of the United States in all respects, framed by\r\n     a convention of delegates elected by the male citizens of\r\n     said State twenty-one years old and upward, of whatever\r\n     race, color, or previous condition of servitude, who have\r\n     been resident in said State for one year previous to the day\r\n     of such election, except such as may be disfranchised for\r\n     participation in the rebellion, or for felony at common law,\r\n     and when such Constitution shall provide that the elective\r\n     franchise shall be enjoyed by all such persons as have the\r\n     qualifications herein stated for electors of delegates, and\r\n     when such Constitution shall be ratified by a majority of\r\n     the persons voting on the question of ratification who are\r\n     qualified as electors of delegates, and when such\r\n     Constitution shall have been submitted to Congress for\r\n     examination and approval, and Congress shall have appointed\r\n     the same, and when said State, by a vote of its Legislature\r\n     elected under said Constitution, shall have adopted the\r\n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States proposed\r\n     by the Thirty-ninth Congress, and known as article fourteen,\r\n     and when said article shall have become a part of the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, said State shall be\r\n     declared entitled to representation in Congress, and\r\n     Senators and Representatives shall be admitted therefrom on\r\n     their taking the oath prescribed by law, and then and\r\n     thereafter the preceding sections of this act shall be\r\n     inoperative in said State.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman made a brief speech in explanation of the bill. \"All there\r\nis material in the bill,\" said he, \"is in the first two lines of the\r\npreamble and the fifth section, in my judgment. The first two lines\r\nmay lay the foundation, by adopting the proclamation issued first to\r\nNorth Carolina, that the rebellion had swept away all the civil\r\ngovernments in the Southern States; and the fifth section points out\r\nthe mode by which the people of those States, in their own manner,\r\nwithout any limitations or restrictions by Congress, may get back to\r\nfull representation in Congress.\"\r\n\r\nAfter numerous propositions to amend, and speeches against the bill by\r\nMessrs. Hendricks, Cowan, Buckalew and McDougall, the Senate reached a\r\nvote upon the bill at six o'clock on Sunday morning. Twenty-nine voted\r\nin the affirmative, namely:\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Anthony, Brown, Cattell, Chandler, Conness, Cragin,\r\n     Creswell, Fogg, Frelinghuysen, Grimes, Howard, Howe,\r\n     Kirkwood, Lane, Morgan, Morrill, Poland, Pomeroy, Ramsey,\r\n     Ross, Sherman, Stewart, Trumbull, Van Winkle, Wade, Willey,\r\n     Williams, Wilson, and Yates.\r\n\r\nTen voted in the negative, to-wit:\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Buckalew, Cowan, Davis, Doolittle, Hendricks,\r\n     McDougall, Nesmith, Norton, Patterson, and Saulsbury.\r\n\r\nThe Senate amended the title of the bill by substituting the word\r\n\"rebel\" for \"insurrectionary.\" Thus passed in the Senate the great\r\nmeasure entitled \"A bill to provide for the more efficient government\r\nof the rebel States.\"\r\n\r\nOn Monday, February 18th, the bill, as amended, came before the House.\r\nMr. Stevens moved that the amendments of the Senate be non-concurred\r\nin, and that the House ask a Committee of Conference.\r\n\r\nMr. Boutwell opposed the amendment. \"If I did not believe,\" said he,\r\n\"that this bill, in the form in which it now comes to us from the\r\nSenate, was fraught with great and permanent danger to the country, I\r\nwould not attempt to resist further its passage.\"\r\n\r\nHe objected to the bill on the ground that it proposed to reconstruct\r\nthe rebel State governments at once, through the agency of disloyal\r\nmen, and that it gave additional power to the President when he had\r\nfailed to use the vast power which he already possessed in behalf of\r\nloyalty and justice.\r\n\r\nMr. Stokes saw in the bill the principle of universal amnesty and\r\nuniversal suffrage. \"I would rather have nothing,\" said he, \"if these\r\ngovernments are reconstructed in a way that will place the rebels over\r\nUnion men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, what has the Senate done?\" Mr. Stevens asked. \"Sent back to us\r\nan amendment which contains every thing else but protection. It has\r\nsent us back a bill which raises the whole question in dispute as to\r\nthe best mode of reconstructing these States by distant and future\r\npledges which this Congress has no authority to make and no power to\r\nexecute. What power has this Congress to say to a future Congress,\r\nWhen the Southern States have done certain things, you shall admit\r\nthem, and receive their members into this House?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our friends,\" said he, in another part of his remarks, \"who love this\r\nbill, love it now because the President is to execute it, as he has\r\nexecuted every law for the last two years, by the murder of Union men,\r\nand by despising Congress and flinging into our teeth all that we seek\r\nto have done.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens thought that in two hours a Committee of Conference could\r\nframe a bill and report it to the House free from all these\r\ndifficulties--free from all this extraneous matter--which would\r\nprotect every loyal man in the Southern States, and do no injustice to\r\nthe disloyal.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine supported the bill as it came from the Senate. \"Congress,\"\r\nsaid he, \"no more guarantees, under this bill, the right of any rebel\r\nin any State to vote than did Congress guarantee to the rebels in\r\nTennessee the right to vote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Although this bill,\" said Mr. Wilson of Iowa, \"does not attain all I\r\ndesire to accomplish, it does embrace much upon which I have insisted.\r\nIt reaches far beyond any thing which the most sanguine of us hoped\r\nfor a year ago. It secures equal suffrage to all loyal men; it sets\r\naside the pretended governments which now abuse power in the rebel\r\nStates; it insists on the ratification of the Constitutional\r\nAmendment, under the operation of which all the rebels who now occupy\r\nofficial position in the States affected by this bill will be rendered\r\nineligible to office, State or national; it presents an affirmative\r\npolicy, on the part of Congress, hostile to that of the President; it\r\ndemonstrates the ability of Congress to agree upon a given line of\r\nfuture action; and, finally, it reserves to Congress jurisdiction over\r\nthe whole case when the people of any Southern disorganized State may\r\npresent a Constitution and ask for admission to this body as a part of\r\nthe governing power of the nation. There is too much of good in this\r\nto be rejected. I will vote to concur in the amendment of the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham maintained that in the bill, as it passed the House, they\r\nhad voted as extensive powers to the President as were conferred upon\r\nhim by the bill as amended by the Senate. The former bill provided\r\nthat the General in command of the army should detail army officers;\r\nbut all officers of the army are under command of the Commander-in-chief\r\nas constituted by the supreme law of the land. \"For myself,\" said he,\r\n\"I had rather that my right hand should forget its cunning, and that\r\nmy tongue should cleave to the roof of my mouth, than to find myself\r\nhere so false to my own convictions, and so false to the high trust\r\ncommitted to me by that people who sent me here as to vote against\r\nthis bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"This bill,\" said Mr. Farnsworth, \"provides a platform ten steps in\r\nadvance of the platform upon which we went to the people last fall. We\r\nthen only expected the ratification of the amendment to the\r\nConstitution proposed by Congress at its last session, and the\r\nformation of Constitutions, republican in form, which should give the\r\npeople there the right to send loyal men here as Senators and\r\nRepresentatives. But by this bill we extend impartial suffrage to the\r\nblack man--universal suffrage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am one of those who believe we ought to do something,\" said Mr.\r\nSchenck. \"I believe we ought to declare to these rebel States, as we\r\ndo by this bill, that they shall be put under martial law, and held by\r\nthe strong hand to keep the peace until they have complied with\r\nwhatever conditions are imposed upon them. But while we do this, I\r\nthink it equally important to announce to them, to announce to the\r\ncountry, to announce to our constituents as the completion of the\r\nwhole platform upon which we go before the nation, the terms which we\r\nrequire of them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Garfield favored the Senate amendment. \"There are some gentlemen,\"\r\nsaid he, \"who live among the eagles on the high mountain peaks, beyond\r\nthe limit of perpetual frost, and they see the lineaments in the face\r\nof freedom so much clearer than I do, whenever any measure comes here\r\nthat seems almost to grasp our purpose, they rise and tell us it is\r\nall poor and mean and a surrender of liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\"These terms embrace, in my judgment,\" said Mr. Thayer, \"every\r\nguarantee, every safeguard, and every check which it is proper for us\r\nto demand or apply. Upon these foundations we can safely build, for by\r\nthem we retain the final control of the question in our own hands.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hotchkiss opposed the bill as amended. \"If you allow this bill to\r\ngo into operation as it now stands,\" said he, \"without making any\r\namendment of its provisions, and permit these elections to be held, as\r\nthey must necessarily be held under this bill, under the authority,\r\ncontrol, and regulation of the rebel governments in those States,\r\nthere will be no security whatever, and you will have the elections in\r\nNew Orleans held under the control of Mayor Monroe and the mob which\r\nhe used to such fell purpose last summer. That is the entertainment to\r\nwhich this bill invites us.\r\n\r\n\"I regard this as a flank movement,\" said Mr. Bromwell, \"by which is\r\nto be brought about that darling scheme of certain politicians--universal\r\namnesty and universal suffrage. Whether it end in universal suffrage\r\nor not, one thing is certain, it is universal amnesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be emphatically,\" said Mr. Donnelly, \"a government of\r\nrebels. I say a government of rebels, because although the amendment\r\nwhich has reached us from the Senate contains the words, 'Except such\r\nas may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion,' that\r\ndisfranchisement has to come from the rebels themselves, and surely\r\nthere is no man upon this floor weak enough to suppose that they will\r\nso disfranchise themselves.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Le Blond opposed both bills. Of the one before the House, he said:\r\n\"This bill is quite as infamous, quite as absurd, as the bill that the\r\ndistinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Stevens,] who is\r\nChairman of the Committee on Reconstruction, contends for and hangs so\r\ntenaciously to. It confers all the powers that that bill gives; it\r\nconfers all the powers that the most radical could claim\r\nconsistently.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall content myself,\" said Mr. Eldridge, \"with denouncing this\r\nmeasure as most wicked and abominable. It contains all that is\r\nvicious, all that is mischievous in any and all of the propositions\r\nwhich have come either from the Committee on Reconstruction or from\r\nany gentleman upon the other side of the House.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you do not take this bill,\" said Mr. Delano, \"although in all its\r\nparts it does not suit you, what are you likely to give the American\r\npeople? Nothing. I will not return to my constituents admitting that I\r\nhave failed to try to do something in this great trial of the nation.\r\nIt is not for rebels that I legislate; it is not for the right of\r\nthose who have sought to destroy this Government that I extend mercy;\r\nbut it is for the liberties, rights, and welfare of my country, for\r\nall parts of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If this bill be passed,\" said Mr. Banks, \"in my belief there will be\r\nno loyal party known and no loyal voice heard in any of these States,\r\nfrom Virginia to Texas.\"\r\n\r\nMany members subsequently presented arguments and opinions for and\r\nagainst the bill, in speeches limited to fifteen minutes in length.\r\nThis occupied a session protracted until near midnight.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, February 19th, a vote was taken, and the\r\nHouse refused to concur in the amendments of the Senate, and asked a\r\nCommittee of Conference.\r\n\r\nThe action of the House having been announced in the Senate, that body\r\nimmediately proceeded to consider a motion made by Mr. Williams, that\r\nthey insist on their amendment and agree to the conference. The\r\nproposition to give the subject into the hands of a Committee of\r\nConference was opposed by many Senators, who thought a question of so\r\nmuch importance should be deliberated upon in a full Senate. If such a\r\ncommittee were appointed, their report could only be adopted or\r\nrejected without modification or amendment. They would only have the\r\npower which they possess over a nomination by the President--power to\r\nreject a nominee without naming another.\r\n\r\n\"The result arrived at by the Senate in reference to this bill,\" said\r\nMr. Conness, \"was after the most mature consideration that was ever\r\ngiven to any proposition that came before this body, resulting in an\r\nunanimity, at least on this side of the chamber, unparalleled in\r\nlegislative proceedings--a result hailed by the country at large,\r\ndemanded by the most intelligent and powerful of the American press,\r\nalike acceptable to the industrial and commercial interests of the\r\ncountry, which suffer from a continual disorganization of the country\r\naffecting its vital industries.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact that it is a very important bill,\" said Mr. Williams, \"only\r\nmakes it the more necessary, as it seems to me, to adopt the usual\r\npractice in such cases\"--that of appointing a Committee of Conference.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner favored the appointment of such a committee. The Senate had\r\nmade its best endeavor, the House had refused to concur, and now to\r\nask that body to vote upon the question again without a Committee of\r\nConference would kill the bill. In such a case there could be no hope\r\nduring the session for any just and beneficent measure either of\r\nprotection or reconstruction.\r\n\r\nMr. Fessenden had taken no part in the debate upon the bill when it\r\nwas on its passage. A majority of his political friends having\r\ndetermined that the measure which passed the Senate was the best that\r\ncould be accomplished, he had deemed it his duty not to present his\r\nindividual objections to the bill. \"I would have very much preferred,\"\r\nsaid he, \"the Military Bill, as it was called, pure and simple,\r\nwithout having any thing else upon it, and leaving to other\r\nlegislation, if it was judged expedient, what else might be done.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull had not before said a word in reference to this bill. He\r\nnever regarded the Military Bill as it came from the House of\r\nRepresentatives as of the slightest importance. Section fourteenth, of\r\nthe Freedmen's Bureau Bill conferred all the powers given in the\r\nMilitary Bill. If these had not been used for the protection of the\r\nloyal people of the South, would the reiteration of the statute be to\r\nany purpose? Yet Mr. Trumbull thought the amendment put upon the bill\r\nby the Senate contained every guarantee that had ever been asked for\r\nby any one. He was unwilling that a great question like this, open in\r\nall its parts, should be submitted to a Committee of Conference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon. John Conness, Senator from California.]\r\n\r\nThe vote was finally taken, after a prolonged discussion. The Senate\r\ninsisted on its amendment, and refused to appoint a Committee of\r\nConference.\r\n\r\nThe bill having gone back to the House of Representatives, they\r\nresolved by a vote of one hundred and twenty-six to forty-six to\r\nrecede from their disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and to\r\nconcur in the same with amendments, providing that no person excluded\r\nfrom holding office by the recently proposed Constitutional Amendment\r\nshould be eligible for membership in the convention to frame a\r\nconstitution for any of the rebel States, nor should any such person\r\nbe allowed to vote for members of such convention. Another amendment\r\nproposed by the House was the addition of a section (sixth) to the\r\nbill providing that until the rebel States should be admitted to\r\nrepresentation in Congress, any civil governments existing therein\r\nshould be deemed provisional only, and subject to the paramount\r\nauthority of the United States, who may at any time abolish, modify,\r\ncontrol, or supersede them.\r\n\r\nThis qualified concurrence on the part of the House having been\r\nannounced in the Senate, that body proceeded immediately to consider\r\nthe question of acquiescence.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman said that his only objection to the amendment of the House\r\nwas, that it disfranchised ten or fifteen thousand leading rebels from\r\nvoting at the elections, yet he was willing to agree to the amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner congratulated Mr. Sherman on the advanced step he had\r\ntaken. \"To-morrow,\" said Mr. Sumner, \"I hope to welcome the Senator to\r\nsome other height.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman was unwilling to admit that he had come to Mr. Sumner's\r\nstand-point. He was willing to accept the bill, although it excluded a\r\nfew thousand rebels from voting, yet \"I would rather have them all\r\nvote,\" said he, \"white and black, under the stringent restrictions of\r\nthis bill, and let the governments of the Southern States that are\r\nabout now to rise upon the permanent foundation of universal liberty\r\nand universal equality, stand upon the consent of the governed, white\r\nand black, former slaves and former masters.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed an extended discussion of the question as to whether the\r\nSenate should agree to the amendments proposed by the House. Mr.\r\nDoolittle proposed and advocated an amendment providing that nothing\r\nin the bill should be construed to disfranchise persons who have\r\nreceived pardon and amnesty. This amendment was rejected--yeas, 8;\r\nnays, 33.\r\n\r\nThe vote was then taken upon the final passage of the bill as amended\r\nby the House; it passed the Senate--yeas, 35; nays, 7.\r\n\r\nThe Bill \"to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel\r\nStates,\" having thus passed both houses of Congress on the 20th of\r\nFebruary, it was immediately submitted to the President for his\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nOn the second of March the President returned the bill to the House,\r\nin which it originated, with his objections, which were so grave that\r\nhe hoped a statement of them might \"have some influence on the minds\r\nof the patriotic and enlightened men with whom the decision must\r\nultimately rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe Veto Message was immediately read by the clerk of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The following extracts present the President's\r\nprincipal objections to the measure:\r\n\r\n     \"The bill places all the people of the ten States therein\r\n     named under the absolute domination of military rulers. * * *\r\n\r\n     \"It is not denied that the States in question have each of\r\n     them an actual government, with all the powers, executive,\r\n     judicial, and legislative which properly belong to a free\r\n     State. They are organized like the other States of the\r\n     Union, and like them they make, administer, and execute the\r\n     laws which concern their domestic affairs. An existing _de\r\n     facto_ government, exercising such functions as these, is\r\n     itself the law of the State upon all matters within its\r\n     jurisdiction. To pronounce the supreme law-making power of\r\n     an established State illegal is to say that law itself is\r\n     unlawful. * * *\r\n\r\n     \"The military rule which it establishes is plainly to be\r\n     used, not for any purpose of order or for the prevention of\r\n     crime, but solely as a means of coercing the people into the\r\n     adoption of principles and measures to which it is known\r\n     that they are opposed, and upon which they have an\r\n     undeniable right to exercise their own judgment.\r\n\r\n     \"I submit to Congress whether this measure is not, in its\r\n     whole character, scope, and object, without precedent and\r\n     without authority, in palpable conflict with the plainest\r\n     provisions of the Constitution, and utterly destructive to\r\n     those great principles of liberty and humanity for which our\r\n     ancestors on both sides of the Atlantic have shed so much\r\n     blood and expended so much treasure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"The power thus given to the commanding officer over all the\r\n     people of each district is that of an absolute monarch. His\r\n     mere will is to take the place of all law. The law of the\r\n     States is now the only rule applicable to the subjects\r\n     placed under his control, and that is completely displaced\r\n     by the clause which declares all interference of State\r\n     authority to be null and void. He alone is permitted to\r\n     determine what are rights of person or property, and he may\r\n     protect them in such way as in his discretion may seem\r\n     proper. It places at his free disposal all the lands and\r\n     goods in his district, and he may distribute them without\r\n     let or hinderance to whom he pleases. Being bound by no\r\n     State law, and there being no other law to regulate the\r\n     subject, he may make a criminal code of his own; and he can\r\n     make it as bloody as any recorded in history, or he can\r\n     reserve the privilege of acting upon the impulse of his\r\n     private passions in each case that arises. He is bound by no\r\n     rules of evidence; there is indeed no provision by which he\r\n     is authorized or required to take any evidence at all. Every\r\n     thing is a crime which he chooses to call so, and all\r\n     persons are condemned whom he pronounces to be guilty. He is\r\n     not bound to keep any record or make any report of his\r\n     proceedings. He may arrest his victims wherever he finds\r\n     them, without warrant, accusation, or proof of probable\r\n     cause. If he gives them a trial before he inflicts the\r\n     punishment, he gives it of his grace and mercy, not because\r\n     he is commanded so to do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Cruel or unusual punishment is not to be inflicted, but who\r\n     is to decide what is cruel and what is unusual? * * * Each\r\n     officer may define cruelty according to his own temper, and\r\n     if it is not usual, he will make it usual. Corporal\r\n     punishment, imprisonment, the gag, the ball and chain, and\r\n     the almost insupportable forms of torture invented for\r\n     military punishment lie within the range of choice. The\r\n     sentence of a commission is not to be executed without being\r\n     approved by the commander, if it affects life or liberty,\r\n     and a sentence of death must be approved by the President.\r\n     This applies to cases in which there has been a trial and\r\n     sentence. I take it to be clear, under this bill, that the\r\n     military commander may condemn to death without even the\r\n     form of a trial by a military commission, so that the life\r\n     of the condemned may depend upon the will of two men instead\r\n     of one.\r\n\r\n     \"It is plain that the authority here given to the military\r\n     officer amounts to absolute despotism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"I come now to a question which is, if possible, still more\r\n     important. Have we the power to establish and carry into\r\n     execution a measure like this? I answer certainly not, if we\r\n     derive our authority from the Constitution, and if we are\r\n     bound by the limitations which it imposes. This proposition\r\n     is perfectly clear; that no branch of the Federal\r\n     Government, executive, legislative, or judicial, can have\r\n     any just powers except those which it derives through and\r\n     exercises under the organic law of the Union. Outside of the\r\n     Constitution we have no legal authority more than private\r\n     citizens, and within it we have only so much as that\r\n     instrument gives us. This broad principle limits all our\r\n     function and applies to all subjects. It protects not only\r\n     the citizens of States which are within the Union, but it\r\n     shields every human being who comes or is brought under our\r\n     jurisdiction. \"We have no right to do in one place more than\r\n     in another that which the Constitution says we shall not do\r\n     at all. If, therefore, the Southern States were in truth out\r\n     of the Union, we could not treat their people in a way which\r\n     the fundamental law forbids. * * *\r\n\r\n     \"If an insurrection should take place in one of our States\r\n     against the authority of the State government, and end in\r\n     the overthrowing of those who planned it, would they take\r\n     away the rights of all the people of the counties where it\r\n     was favored by a part or a majority of the population? Could\r\n     they for such a reason be wholly outlawed and deprived of\r\n     their representation in the Legislature? I have always\r\n     contended that the Government of the United States was\r\n     sovereign within its constitutional sphere; that it executed\r\n     its laws like the States themselves, by applying its\r\n     coercive power directly to individuals; and that it could\r\n     put down insurrection with the same effect as a State and no\r\n     other. The opposite doctrine is the worst heresy of those\r\n     who advocated secession, and can not be agreed to without\r\n     admitting that heresy to be right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"This is a bill passed by Congress in time of peace. There\r\n     is not in any one of the States brought under its operation\r\n     either war or insurrection. The laws of the States and of\r\n     the Federal Government are all in undisturbed and harmonious\r\n     operation. The courts, State and Federal, are open and in\r\n     the full exercise of their proper authority. Over every\r\n     State comprised in these five military districts life,\r\n     liberty, and property are secured by State laws and Federal\r\n     laws, and the national Constitution is every-where enforced\r\n     and every-were obeyed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Actual war, foreign invasion, domestic insurrection--none\r\n     of these appear, and none of these in fact exist. It is not\r\n     even recited that any sort of war or insurrection is\r\n     threatened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon this question of constitutional law and the power of Congress,\"\r\nthe President gave quotations from \"a recent decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt _ex parte_ Milligan.\" Having commented upon this opinion, the\r\nPresident proceeded with his objections:\r\n\r\n     \"I need not say to the Representatives of the American\r\n     people that their Constitution forbids the exercise of\r\n     judicial power in any way but one; that is, by the ordained\r\n     and established courts. It is equally well known that, in\r\n     all criminal cases, a trial by jury is made indispensable by\r\n     the express words of that instrument. I will not enlarge on\r\n     the inestimable value of the right thus secured to every\r\n     freeman, or speak of the danger to public liberty, in all\r\n     parts of the country, which must ensue from a denial of it\r\n     anywhere, or upon any pretense. * * *\r\n\r\n     \"The United States are bound to guaranty to each State a\r\n     republican form of government Can it be pretended that this\r\n     obligation is not palpably broken if we carry out a measure\r\n     like this, which wipes away every vestige of republican\r\n     government in ten States, and put the life, property,\r\n     liberty and honor of all the people in each of them under\r\n     the domination of a single person clothed with unlimited\r\n     authority.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"The purpose and object of the bill--the general intent\r\n     which pervades it from beginning to end--is to change the\r\n     entire structure and character of the State governments, and\r\n     to compel them by force to the adoption of organic laws and\r\n     regulations which they are unwilling to accept if left to\r\n     themselves. The negroes have not asked for the privilege of\r\n     voting; the vast majority of them have no idea what it\r\n     means. This bill not only thrusts it into their hands, but\r\n     compels them, as well as the whites, to use it in a\r\n     particular way. If they do not form a Constitution with\r\n     prescribed articles in it, and afterward elect a Legislature\r\n     which will act upon certain measures in a prescribed way,\r\n     neither blacks nor whites can be relieved from the slavery\r\n     which the bill imposes upon them. Without pausing here to\r\n     consider the policy or impolicy of Africanizing the Southern\r\n     part of our territory, I would simply ask the attention of\r\n     Congress to that manifest, well-known, and\r\n     universally-acknowledged rule of constitutional law which\r\n     declares that the Federal Government has no jurisdiction,\r\n     authority, or power to regulate such subjects for any State.\r\n     To force the right of suffrage out of the hands of the white\r\n     people and into the hands of the negroes is an arbitrary\r\n     violation of this principle.\r\n\r\n     \"This bill imposes martial law at once, and its operations\r\n     will begin so soon as the General and his troops can be put\r\n     in place. The dread alternative between its harsh rule and\r\n     compliance with the terms of this measure is not suspended,\r\n     nor are the people afforded any time for free deliberation.\r\n     The bill says to them, Take martial law first, then\r\n     deliberate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"The bill also denies the legality of the governments of ten\r\n     of the States which participated in the ratification of the\r\n     amendment to the Federal Constitution abolishing slavery\r\n     forever within the jurisdiction of the United States, and\r\n     practically excludes them from the Union. * * *\r\n\r\n     \"That the measure proposed by this bill does violate the\r\n     Constitution in the particulars mentioned, and in many other\r\n     ways which I forbear to enumerate is too clear to admit of\r\n     the least doubt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"I am thoroughly convinced that any settlement, or\r\n     compromise, or plan of action which is inconsistent with the\r\n     principles of the Constitution, will not only be unavailing,\r\n     but mischievous; that it will but multiply the present evils\r\n     instead of removing them. The Constitution, in its whole\r\n     integrity and vigor, throughout the length and breadth of\r\n     the land, is the best of all compromises. Besides, our duty\r\n     does not, in my judgment, leave us a choice between that and\r\n     any other. I believe that it contains the remedy that is so\r\n     much needed, and that if the coördinate branches of the\r\n     Government would unite upon its provisions, they would be\r\n     found broad enough and strong enough to sustain, in time of\r\n     peace, the nation which they bore safely through the ordeal\r\n     of a protracted civil war. Among the most sacred guarantees\r\n     of that instrument are those which declare that 'each State\r\n     shall have at least one Representative,' and that 'no State,\r\n     without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage\r\n     in the Senate.' Each house is made the 'judge of the\r\n     elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members,'\r\n     and may, 'with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a\r\n     member.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"And is it not far better that the work of restoration\r\n     should be accomplished by simple compliance with the plain\r\n     requirements of the Constitution, than by a recourse to\r\n     measures which, in effect, destroy the States, and threaten\r\n     the subversion of the General Government? All that is\r\n     necessary to settle this simple but important question,\r\n     without further agitation or delay, is a willingness, on the\r\n     part of all, to sustain the Constitution, and carry its\r\n     provisions into practical operation. If to-morrow either\r\n     branch of Congress would declare that, upon the presentation\r\n     of their credentials, members constitutionally elected, and\r\n     loyal to the General Government, would be admitted to seats\r\n     in Congress, while all others would be excluded, and their\r\n     places remain vacant until the selection by the people of\r\n     loyal and qualified persons; and if, at the same time,\r\n     assurance were given that this policy would be continued\r\n     until all the States were represented in Congress, it would\r\n     send a thrill of joy throughout the entire land, as\r\n     indicating the inauguration of a system which must speedily\r\n     bring tranquillity to the public mind.\r\n\r\n     \"While we are legislating upon subjects which are of great\r\n     importance to the whole people, and which must affect all\r\n     parts of the country, not only during the life of the\r\n     present generation, but for ages to come, we should remember\r\n     that all men are entitled at least to a hearing in the\r\n     councils which decide upon the destiny of themselves and\r\n     their children. At present ten States are denied\r\n     representation, and when the Fortieth Congress assembles, on\r\n     the fourth day of the present month, sixteen States will be\r\n     without a voice in the House of Representatives. This grave\r\n     fact, with the important questions before us, should induce\r\n     us to pause in a course of legislation, which, looking\r\n     solely to the attainment of political ends, fails to\r\n     consider the rights it transgresses, the law which it\r\n     violates, or the institutions which it imperils.\r\n\r\n                                             \"ANDREW JOHNSON.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the reading of the message, the question came up, \"Shall the\r\nbill pass, the objections of the President to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Eldridge declared that it would be the duty of the minority, if it\r\nwere within their physical power, to defeat the bill. \"But we are\r\nconscious,\" said he, \"that no effort of ours can prevent its passage,\r\nand the consequent accomplishment of a dissolution of the Union, and\r\nthe overthrow and abandonment of our constitution of government. We\r\ncan only, in the name of the Constitution, in the name of the\r\nrepublic, in the name of all we hold dear on earth, earnestly,\r\nsolemnly protest against this action of this Congress.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Le Blond said that \"the passage of this bill would be the\r\ndeath-knell of republican liberty upon this continent.\" He declared\r\nhis willingness, if a sufficient number on his side of the House would\r\nstand by him, to resist to the utmost extremity of physical exhaustion\r\nthe passage of this bill, which would \"strike a death-blow to this\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens would not be discourteous to those who were opposed to\r\nthis bill: \"I am aware,\" said he, \"of the melancholy feelings with\r\nwhich they are approaching this funeral of the nation.\" He was\r\nunwilling, however, to lose the opportunity to pass the bill at once,\r\nand send it to the Senate, that the House might proceed to other\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken, and the House passed the bill over the President's\r\nveto--yeas, 135; nays, 48. The announcement of this result was\r\nfollowed by great applause on the floor and in the galleries.\r\n\r\nThe immense numbers that had assembled in the galleries of the House\r\nto witness these proceedings went immediately to the other end of the\r\nCapitol to see the reception which the Veto Message would receive in\r\nthe Senate. The consideration of the subject, however, was deferred\r\nuntil the evening session.\r\n\r\nThe Veto Message having been read in the Senate by the Secretary, the\r\npending question at once became whether the bill should pass\r\nnotwithstanding the objections of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson advocated the passage of the bill over the veto. \"It\r\ncontains,\" said he, speaking of the President's message, \"some legal\r\npropositions which are unsound, and many errors of reasoning. I lament\r\nthe course he has thought it his duty to pursue, because I see that it\r\nmay result in continued turmoil and peril, not only to the South, but\r\nto the entire country. I see before me a distressed, a desolated\r\ncountry, and in the measure before you I think I see the means through\r\nwhich it may be rescued and restored erelong to prosperity and a\r\nhealthful condition, and the free institutions of our country\r\npreserved.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to a charge of inconsistency brought against him by Mr.\r\nBuckalew, Mr. Johnson said: \"Consistency in a public man can never\r\nproperly be esteemed a virtue when he becomes satisfied that it will\r\noperate to the prejudice of his country. The pride of opinion, which\r\nmore or less belongs to us all, becomes, in my judgment, in a public\r\nman, a crime when it is indulged at the sacrifice or hazard of the\r\npublic safety.\" He urged upon the people of the South their acceptance\r\nof the terms proposed by Congress. In view of the probability these\r\novertures should be rejected, harsher measures would be resorted to.\r\n\r\nMr. Saulsbury expressed his admiration for the wisdom of the President\r\nin \"vetoing the most iniquitous bill that ever was presented to the\r\nFederal Congress.\" \"I hope,\" said he, \"that there may be no man within\r\nthe limits of these ten States who will participate in his own\r\ndisgrace, degradation, and ruin: let them maintain their honor. If\r\nthere be wrath in the vials of the Almighty, if there be arrows of\r\nvengeance in his quiver, such iniquity and injustice can not finally\r\nprove successful.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hendricks disagreed with the Senator from Delaware that the people\r\nof the South, at once and without consideration, must turn their backs\r\nupon the proposition now made them in order to maintain their honor.\r\nHe hoped they would bring to the consideration of the subject the\r\ncoolest judgment and the highest patriotism. He was still opposed to\r\nthe bill; he approved of the President's veto. His judgment against\r\nthe measure had been \"fortified and strengthened by that able\r\ndocument.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the question was continued by Messrs. Buckalew,\r\nDixon, and Davis, who spoke against the bill. The friends of the\r\nmeasure were content to let the subject go without a further word from\r\nthem, save the solemn and final declaration of their votes.\r\n\r\nThe question being taken, the bill was passed over the veto by a vote\r\nof almost four-fifths. Thirty-eight Senators voted for the bill in its\r\nfinal passage, and but ten were found willing to stand by the\r\nPresident and his veto.\r\n\r\nThe bill whose progress through Congress has thus been traced became a\r\nlaw of the land in the following form:\r\n\r\n     \"AN ACT to provide for the more efficient government of the\r\n     rebel States\r\n\r\n     \"_Whereas_, no legal State governments or adequate\r\n     protection for life or property now exists in the rebel\r\n     States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,\r\n     Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Florida, Texas, and\r\n     Arkansas; and _whereas_ it is necessary that peace and good\r\n     order should be enforced in said States until loyal and\r\n     republican State governments can be legally established:\r\n     therefore,\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives\r\n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled_, That\r\n     said rebel States shall be divided into military districts\r\n     and made subject to the military authority of the United\r\n     States, as hereinafter prescribed; and for that purpose\r\n     Virginia shall constitute the first district, North Carolina\r\n     and South Carolina the second district, Georgia, Alabama,\r\n     and Florida the third district, Mississippi and Arkansas the\r\n     fourth district, and Louisiana and Texas the fifth\r\n     district.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That it shall be the\r\n     duty of the President to assign to the command of each of\r\n     said districts an officer of the army not below the rank of\r\n     brigadier general, and to detail a sufficient military force\r\n     to enable such officer to perform his duties and enforce his\r\n     authority within the district to which he is assigned.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3. _And be it further enacted_, That it shall be the\r\n     duty of each officer assigned, as aforesaid, to protect all\r\n     persons in their rights of person and property, to suppress\r\n     insurrection, disorder, and violence, and to punish, or\r\n     cause to be punished, all disturbers of the public peace and\r\n     criminals;

This record\r\nwould be incomplete without a statement of what was done to perfect\r\nthe measure in the succeeding Congress. The Fortieth Congress, meeting\r\non the 4th of March, immediately upon the close of its predecessor,\r\nproceeded without delay to perfect and pass over the President's veto\r\na bill supplementary to the act to provide for the more efficient\r\ngovernment of the rebel States. By this act it was provided that the\r\ncommanding general of each district should cause a registration to be\r\nmade of the male citizens twenty-one years of age in his district,\r\nqualified to vote under the former act. In order to be registered as a\r\nvoter under this act, a person is required to swear that he has not\r\nbeen disfranchised for participation in any rebellion or civil war\r\nagainst the United States, nor for felony; that he has never been a\r\nmember of any State Legislature, nor held any executive or judicial\r\noffice in any State and afterward engaged in insurrection or rebellion\r\nagainst the United States, or given aid or comfort to the enemies\r\nthereof; that he has never taken an oath as a member of Congress of\r\nthe United States, or as a member of any State Legislature, or as an\r\nexecutive or judicial officer of any State, to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and afterward engaged in\r\ninsurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given aid or\r\ncomfort to the enemies thereof, and that he will faithfully support\r\nthe Constitution and obey the laws of the United States, and encourage\r\nothers to do so.\r\n\r\nPersons thus qualified shall vote at elections held for the purpose of\r\nselecting delegates to the conventions for framing constitutions for\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\nA majority of voters so qualified shall determine whether\r\nconstitutional conventions shall be held in the several States, and\r\nshall vote for delegates who shall be as numerous as the members of\r\nthe most numerous branch of the Legislature of such State in the year\r\n1860. This convention having framed a constitution, it shall be\r\nsubmitted to the people, and if ratified by a majority of the\r\nqualified voters, it shall be forthwith transmitted to Congress. If\r\nthis constitution is satisfactory to Congress, and found to be in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the act of which this is\r\nsupplementary, the State shall be declared entitled to representation.\r\nAll elections are required to be by ballot, and all officers acting\r\nunder the provisions of this act are required to take the test oath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nOTHER IMPORTANT ACTS.\r\n\r\n     Equalizing Bounties -- The Army -- The Department of\r\n     Education -- Southern Homesteads -- The Bankrupt Law -- The\r\n     Tariff -- Reduction of Taxes -- Contracting the Currency --\r\n     Issue of Three Per Cents. -- Nebraska and Colorado -- Tenure\r\n     of Office.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great national measures, whose progress through Congress has been\r\ngiven in detail, occupied the attention of that body continuously,\r\nfrom the first days of its existence to the closing hours of its last\r\nsession. No day passed which was not rendered important by something\r\nsaid or done upon questions which concern not only the nation, but\r\nhumanity, and which are of interest not only for the present, but for\r\nall time to come. While these great measures were passing through\r\nCongress, making it memorable, and absorbing the public attention,\r\nthere was a constant undercurrent of patient, laborious legislation\r\nupon subjects of less interest to the public, but of real importance\r\nto the country.\r\n\r\nOne of the first duties devolving upon the Thirty-ninth Congress was\r\nthe great work of disbanding the vast volunteer army which had\r\nsuppressed the rebellion, saved the country, and earned the undying\r\ngratitude of the nation. The soldiers of the republic were to be paid\r\nfor their distinguished services, their reasonable demands for\r\nequalization of bounty were to be met, and a suitable number retained\r\nin the service for the necessities of the nation on a \"peace footing.\"\r\nNear the close of the first session, a bill to equalize soldiers'\r\nbounties, introduced by Mr. Schenck of Ohio, passed the House by a\r\nnearly unanimous vote, but was lost in the Senate. Subsequently, the\r\nSenate attached to the Civil Appropriation Bill a provision for paying\r\nadditional bounty, differing materially from the bill which passed the\r\nHouse. This being in such shape that it could not be easily detached,\r\nbecame a law.\r\n\r\nDuring the first session, Congress passed the \"Act to increase and fix\r\nthe military peace establishment of the United States.\" By this law\r\nthe regular army consists of five regiments of artillery, ten\r\nregiments of cavalry, and forty-five regiments of infantry. It\r\nacknowledged the services and claims of the volunteer officers and men\r\nwho served in the recent war by providing that a large proportion of\r\nthe commissions in the new service should be conferred upon them. At\r\nthe same time the standard of attainment and talent was not lowered,\r\nsince the law provided for such an examination as must exclude the\r\nunqualified and relieve the army from some who unworthily held\r\ncommissions.\r\n\r\nThe important fact that general intelligence is one of the greatest\r\nsafeguards of the nation was fully recognized by the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress. Of this they gave permanent proof in establishing a Bureau\r\nof Education. Early in the first session, Mr. Donnelly, of Minnesota,\r\nintroduced a resolution instructing the joint Committee on\r\nReconstruction to inquire into the expediency of establishing a\r\nNational Bureau of Education \"to enforce education, without regard to\r\ncolor.\" The necessity for such a measure was set forth in the preamble\r\nto arise from the fact that \"republican institutions can find\r\npermanent safety only upon the basis of the universal intelligence of\r\nthe people,\" and that \"the great disasters which have afflicted the\r\nnation and desolated one-half its territory are traceable in a great\r\ndegree to the absence of common schools and general education among\r\nthe people of lately rebellious States.\" This resolution passed the\r\nHouse by a large majority.\r\n\r\nThis subject was subsequently referred to an able select committee, of\r\nwhich Mr. Garfield was chairman. On the 5th of June he reported a bill\r\nto establish a Department of Education. The measure was supported by\r\nMessrs. Donnelly, Garfield, Banks, and Boutwell, and opposed by\r\nMessrs. Pike, Rogers, and Randall. The bill passed the House on the\r\n19th of June and went to the Senate, where it was referred to the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary. The bill went over, in the press of\r\nbusiness, to the second session, and passed the Senate on the 28th of\r\nFebruary, 1867.\r\n\r\nA measure indirectly connected with the subject of reconstruction,\r\ndestined to have an important influence upon the future of Southern\r\nsociety, was introduced by Mr. Julian on the 7th of February, 1866.\r\nThis was a bill for the disposal of the public lands for homesteads to\r\nactual settlers, without distinction of color, in the States of\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Florida, providing that\r\nthe quantity of land selected by any one person should be eighty\r\nacres, and not one hundred and sixty acres, as provided in the\r\nHomestead Bill of 1862. The necessity of this measure, as shown by Mr.\r\nJulian, arose from the abolition of slavery and the demands of free\r\nlabor. It was designed to cut off land speculation in the Southern\r\ncountry. \"Without some provision of this kind,\" said Mr. Julian,\r\n\"rebel speculators now hovering over the whole of that region, and\r\nhunting up the best portion of it, and the holders of Agricultural\r\nCollege scrip can come down upon it at one fell swoop and cheat the\r\nactual settler, whether white or black, out of his rights, or even the\r\npossibility of a home in that region, driving the whole of them to\r\nsome of our Western Territories or to starvation itself.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill was finally passed in the House on the 28th of February,\r\n1867, with an amendment excluding from the benefit of the act persons\r\nwho have borne arms against the United States, or given aid and\r\ncomfort to its enemies.\r\n\r\nA work of legislation of much importance, destined to have beneficent\r\neffect upon the business interests of the country, was the passage of\r\nthe Bankrupt Law, which was finally enacted near the close of the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress. The Bankrupt Bill passed the House of\r\nRepresentatives as early as May, 1866, but the Senate objecting to the\r\nentire principle of the bill, it was postponed till December. On the\r\nreässembling of Congress for the second session, the consideration of\r\nthe Bankrupt Bill was resumed, and after much opposition in the\r\nSenate, it finally received the support of a decisive majority in that\r\nbody of all shades of politics. The perfection and final passage of\r\nthis measure were among the last acts of the Thirty-ninth Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Bankrupt Law of 1800 was enacted in the interest of creditors, and\r\nthat of 1841 for the benefit of debtors. The law of 1867 was framed\r\nwith a view to protect the interests of both parties. The passage of\r\nthis important law is due mainly to the energy and perseverance of\r\nThomas A. Jenckes, of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the tariff occupied, first and last, a considerable\r\nshare of the time and attention of the Thirty-ninth Congress. In the\r\nearly part of the first session numerous petitions poured in upon\r\nCongress in favor of a protective tariff. In June and July the subject\r\nwas discussed, and a Tariff Bill passed the House by a vote of\r\nninety-four to fifty-three. The friends of protection said of this\r\nbill that though not perfect, it was \"a decided improvement on the\r\ntariff in existence.\" The bill, on its introduction to the Senate was\r\npostponed till December.\r\n\r\nThere was soon after introduced into the House a revised Tariff Bill,\r\nentitled a bill \"to protect the revenue.\" Gradually many of the\r\nfeatures which the advocates of protection regarded as most important,\r\nwere eliminated from the bill. This was passed in the Senate on the\r\n24th of July, with amendments in which the House was unwilling to\r\nconcur. A Committee of Conference was appointed, who made a report\r\nwhich was accepted by both Houses of Congress. The bill greatly\r\nmodified and \"enfeebled\" as its original friends regarded it, finally\r\npassed on the day before the close of the first session.\r\n\r\nThe subject of diminishing taxation, as far as consistent with the\r\nobligations of the nation to its creditors, early enlisted and\r\noccupied the attention of the Thirty-ninth Congress. The principle\r\nupon which Congress acted was announced by the distinguished chairman\r\nof the Committee of Ways and Means, Mr. Morrill, to be \"_The abolition\r\nor speedy reduction of all taxes which tend to check development, and\r\nthe retention of all those which like the income tax fall chiefly on\r\nrealized wealth._\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of many conflicting interests, and in the face of\r\nremonstrances, protests, and prayers from every trade and profession,\r\nCongress proceeded to work out the difficult question. As a result of\r\nmost patient and careful investigation, Congress found itself able to\r\nreduce to the extent of one hundred millions of dollars per annum, the\r\ntaxation resting upon the shoulders of the American people.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of finance and the national currency great diversity of\r\nopinion existed among leading members of the Thirty-ninth Congress.\r\nUnanimity prevailed upon the opinion that the currency should sooner\r\nor later be subjected to suitable contraction, but there was diversity\r\nof sentiment as to the ways and means by which this result should be\r\nachieved without involving the country in commercial and financial\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n\"I am for specie payments,\" remarked Mr. Stevens, on one occasion,\r\n\"when we can arrive at them without crushing the community to death. I\r\nam for arriving at specie payments, and still allowing the business of\r\nthe country to go on and thrive, and the people engaged in business to\r\npay the taxes which you impose on them. I say that there is not a man\r\nin the community who would not as soon have one dollar in greenbacks\r\nas one dollar in gold. No one expects to be paid in gold until a\r\ngeneral resumption by the banks of specie payment; nobody now knows\r\nany other currency than greenbacks, and, therefore, I am in favor of\r\nkeeping that currency. In my judgment, we have not more circulation\r\nnow than the expanded business of the country requires.\r\n\r\n\"This war has given an immense impulse to every thing. Whence this\r\nprecipitation? We have barely got out of the war against the rebels\r\nbefore we have a war made upon the business community, upon the\r\nmanufacturing interests, and upon all others.\"\r\n\r\n\"When this great Republican party was made up,\" said Mr. Wentworth,\r\n\"we, who were originally Democrats, took up a cross, and it was a\r\ngreat cross. [Laughter.] We were told that if we went into that thing,\r\nwe should have to lay down at the feet of the irresponsible\r\npaper-money men. Now, I want to know of the gentleman distinctly,\r\nwhether, if he could, he would resume specie payments to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"If,\" replied Mr. Stevens, \"I could have specie payment to-morrow,\r\nwithout deranging the business of the country, I would. If it would\r\nderange the business of the country to return to specie payment at\r\nonce, I would postpone it a little. I voted for the Legal-tender Bill;\r\nand I am glad I did so, for the country would not have survived\r\nwithout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you compromise on a year?\" asked Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; nor on two years,\" replied Mr. Stevens. \"England did not\r\nresume specie payment the year after the wars with France. The Bank of\r\nEngland issued paper money, but the Government had £14,000,000 in the\r\nstock of that bank to give it security, and the Government prevented\r\nit from resuming specie payment until it thought it best. Now, when\r\nthat great war of twenty-five years was over, did England attempt, in\r\n1814 and 1815, to return to specie payment? They had afloat but\r\n£20,000,000, or $100,000,000, and they began with their one-pound\r\nnotes. In a few years they took their two-pound notes; afterward they\r\ntook their five-pound notes. But they never resumed full specie\r\npayment until the latter part of the year 1822. Does my friend from\r\nIllinois expect me to be wiser than the great men of England?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does my friend from Pennsylvania deny,\" asked Mr. Garfield, \"that in\r\n1819 the law for resuming specie payment was passed, to go into effect\r\ngradually at first, and completely in 1823, and that the full\r\nresumption of specie payment actually took place early in the Spring\r\nof 1821--only about a year and three-quarters from the passage of the\r\nlaw?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Mr. Stevens, \"except in very large sums. The law\r\nauthorized them to go on until the first of January, 1823.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they resumed in 1821, about a year and three-quarters earlier,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Garfield.\r\n\r\n\"About a year earlier,\" said Mr. Stevens. \"But the law did not pass\r\nuntil four years after the war. Do gentlemen here expect, when\r\nEngland, with almost all the commerce of the world at her command, was\r\nunable to resume specie payments for eight years after the conclusion\r\nof her wars, and then did it by such gradual legislation that there\r\nshould be no shock to the business of the country--do gentlemen expect\r\nthat we are to put it into the power of one man to compel the\r\nresumption of specie payments in a single year?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know,\" said Mr. Wentworth, \"if the power, and the\r\npatronage, and the influence of the great Republican party, so called,\r\nis to be used to deprive us of our natural standard of value. Now, I\r\nwish, while we go together, to be perfectly honest. Nobody respects\r\nthe talents of my friend from Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevens] more than I\r\ndo. He knows more than all of us put together. [Laughter.] I want him\r\nto state to the House, fairly and candidly, whether, if we follow him,\r\nhe will lead us to specie payment; or whether, if he could, he would.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will say to my friend,\" replied Mr. Stevens, \"that in this case I\r\ndo not act as a member of the Republican party.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have followed the gentlemen,\" said Mr. Wentworth, \"because I\r\nsupposed him to be a Republican leader.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I believed,\" said Mr. Stevens, \"that we could resume specie\r\npayments in a month without crushing the interests of the country,\r\nwithout injuring the laborer, without breaking down the manufacturer,\r\nwithout oppressing the people, without decreasing the revenues of the\r\nGovernment; if I had the power, I would order every bank in the\r\ncountry, State and national, and the Government also, to resume specie\r\npayment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose McCulloch could do that,\" said Mr. Wentworth, \"and give all\r\nour boys their money at par.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he could do it, I would give him great credit,\" said Mr. Stevens.\r\n\r\n\"I believe he can,\" said Mr. Wentworth.\r\n\r\n\"My friend is large,\" said Mr. Stevens, \"and has faith like two grains\r\nof mustard-seed.\"\r\n\r\nPlans were devised, and ultimately carried through Congress, by which\r\nthe great volume of paper currency should be gradually reduced at a\r\ncertain fixed rate, so that the people might know how to calculate the\r\nfuture, and be enabled to provide against a commercial crash.\r\n\r\nThe first measure designed to accomplish this result was popularly\r\ncalled the Loan Bill, which was amendatory of an act \"to provide ways\r\nand means to support the Government.\" When first considered, in March,\r\n1866, it was defeated in the House. It was soon after brought up again\r\nin a modified form, and passed both the House and Senate by large\r\nmajorities. The act provided that the Secretary of the Treasury might\r\nreceive treasury notes, or \"other obligations issued under any act of\r\nCongress,\" in exchange for bonds. The contraction of the currency was\r\nrestricted and limited by the provision that not more than ten\r\nmillions of dollars might be retired and canceled within six months\r\nfrom the passage of the act, and thereafter not more than four\r\nmillions of dollars in any one month.\r\n\r\nA financial problem of great importance presented itself for solution\r\nin the second session of the Thirty-ninth Congress. A large amount of\r\ncompound-interest notes, weighed down with accrued interest, had\r\nceased to float as currency, and lay in the vaults of the banks and\r\nthe coffers of capitalists, awaiting redemption. The question arose as\r\nto how they should be redeemed, and the nation saved the payment of\r\nthe immense amounts of interest which must accumulate in course of\r\ntime. The House of Representatives proposed to pass an act authorizing\r\nand directing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue legal-tender\r\nnotes, without interest, not exceeding $100,000,000, in place of the\r\ncompound-interest bearing notes.\r\n\r\nTo this proposition the Senate would not accede, and passed a\r\nsubstitute which the House would not accept. A Committee of Conference\r\nreported a modification of the Senate's substitute, which finally\r\nbecame a law, providing that, for the purpose of redeeming and\r\nretiring compound-interest notes, the Secretary of the Treasury should\r\nissue temporary loan certificates, to the amount of $50,000,000, at a\r\nrate of interest not exceeding three per cent. per annum.\r\n\r\nWhile the greater share of the attention of the Thirty-ninth Congress\r\nwas occupied with efforts to reconstruct the eleven States which had\r\nforfeited their rights by rebellion, the Territories of Colorado and\r\nNebraska applied for admission to the Union. Congress voted to admit\r\nboth, but the President obstructed their entrance with his vetoes.\r\nCongress, on reconsideration, admitted Nebraska, the objections of the\r\nPresident to the contrary notwithstanding. Colorado was not so\r\nfortunate, since her people had been so unwise as to prejudice their\r\ncause by restricting the enjoyment of political rights by ingrafting\r\nthe word \"white\" into their fundamental law. By this mistake they\r\nforfeited the favor of the \"Radicals,\" who refused to champion their\r\ncause against the President. Incidental to this, Congress ordained\r\nthat political rights should not be restricted in the Territories on\r\naccount of race or color.\r\n\r\nThe manifest evils of unrestricted Executive patronage--the bane of\r\nAmerican politics--early enlisted the efforts of the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress to provide a remedy. A bill to regulate appointments to and\r\nremovals from office was introduced by Mr. Henderson into the Senate\r\nnear the close of the first session, and referred to the Committee on\r\nthe Judiciary, but never saw the light as an act of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe President's power of removal and appointment having been\r\nunsparingly used during the recess of Congress, the country became\r\nconvinced that a remedy should be applied which would be effectual for\r\ntime to come. On the first day of the second session, Mr. Williams\r\nbrought before the Senate a bill to \"regulate the tenure of offices,\"\r\nwhich was subsequently referred to the joint Committee on\r\nRetrenchment. On the 10th of December Mr. Edmunds, chairman of this\r\ncommittee, reported the bill to the Senate, with amendments. In\r\nbringing forward the measure, Mr. Edmunds asserted that they were\r\nacting in no spirit of hostility to any party or administration\r\nwhatever, but for \"the true republican interest of the country under\r\nall administrations, and under the domination of all parties in the\r\ngrowth before the nation in the future.\" After grave consideration and\r\nprotracted discussion in both houses of Congress, the bill was passed\r\nnear the close of the session. On the 2d of March the bill encountered\r\nthe veto of the President, who saw in the measure serious interference\r\nwith the ability of the Executive to keep his oath to preserve,\r\nprotect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. The bill\r\nwas immediately passed over the veto without debate.\r\n\r\nThe act thus passed provides that officers appointed by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate shall hold their offices until their\r\nsuccessors are in like manner appointed and qualified. Members of the\r\nCabinet hold their offices during the term of the President by whom\r\nthey are appointed, and for one month thereafter, subject to removal\r\nby consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n     The President's treatment of the South -- First Annual\r\n     Message -- Mr. Sumner's Criticism -- The President\r\n     triumphant -- He damages his Cause -- Humor of Mr. Stevens\r\n     -- Vetoes overridden -- The Question submitted to the People\r\n     -- Their Verdict -- Summary of Vetoes -- Impeachment --\r\n     Charges by Mr. Ashley -- Report of the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thirty-ninth Congress is remarkable for having run its entire\r\ncareer with the constant opposition of the Executive obstructing its\r\nprogress. In all representative governments, a contest between the\r\nexecutive and the legislative branches of the government has sooner or\r\nlater arisen, which has invariably ended in the defeat of the former.\r\nThe hopelessness of the contest on the part of the executive, and the\r\npertinacity with which it has been waged, have given it a mock-heroic\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nDuring the months which intervened between the death of Abraham\r\nLincoln and the assembling of Congress, Andrew Johnson had ample time\r\nto preöccupy the field and intrench himself against what he termed a\r\ncoördinate branch \"hanging on the verge of the Government.\"\r\n\r\nIn June, 1865, delegates from the South were first admitted to private\r\ninterviews with the President. On the 17th of June he issued his\r\nproclamation providing for the restoration of civil government in\r\nGeorgia and Alabama, in which he excludes negroes from the category of\r\nloyal citizens entitled to vote. The President soon after proceeded to\r\nappoint provisional governors for the Southern States--a step which\r\nwas viewed with joy by the late rebels, and sorrow by the Union men of\r\nthe North. The character of these appointments may be seen in a\r\nsentiment uttered by Governor Perry soon after his elevation to\r\noffice: \"There is not now in the Southern States,\" said he, \"any one\r\nwho feels more bitterly the humiliation and degradation of going back\r\ninto the Union than I do.\" Governor Perry saved himself from dismissal\r\nby assuring the people that the death of Mr. Lincoln was no loss to\r\nthe South, while he had every hope that Mr. Johnson, an old\r\nslaveholding Democrat, would be an advantage.\r\n\r\nIn Alabama, under the provisional government established by Mr.\r\nJohnson, the convention prohibited negroes from testifying in the\r\ncourts. Rebels throughout the South at once began to make their\r\narrangements for taking part in the government. In November, Governor\r\nPerry made a public demand that when Congress met the Clerk of the\r\nHouse should place on the roll the names of Representatives from the\r\nrebel States.\r\n\r\nWhen South Carolina hesitated to adopt the Constitutional Amendment\r\nabolishing slavery, President Johnson assured the Governor that the\r\nclause giving Congress the power to enforce it by appropriate\r\nlegislation really limited congressional control over the negro\r\nquestion. After this assurance, South Carolina accepted the\r\nConstitutional Amendment.\r\n\r\nIn August and September, 1865, Democratic conventions indorsed the\r\nPresident's policy, and Democratic papers began to praise him.\r\nRepublicans were unwilling to believe that they had been deserted, and\r\nhoped that after the assembling of Congress all differences would\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nThe message of the President, read at the opening of the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress, placed him in direct opposition to the leaders of the\r\nRepublican party, and at variance with his own policy. \"A concession\r\nof the elective franchise,\" said he, \"to the freedmen, by act of the\r\nPresident of the United States, must have been extended to all colored\r\nmen, wherever found, and must have established a change of suffrage in\r\nthe Northern, Middle, and Western States, not less than in the\r\nSouthern and Southwestern.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one could see that the President possessed as much power to\r\nadmit the black man to the right of suffrage in the rebel States as to\r\nappoint provisional governors over them.\r\n\r\nWhile Congress was in session, and actually employed in legislating\r\nfor the restoration of the rebel States, Mr. Johnson substantially\r\ndeclared that Congress had no control over the subject, by removing\r\nthe provisional governor of Alabama, and handing the State Government\r\nover to the officers elected by the people.\r\n\r\nThe Senate having requested information from the President as to the\r\ncondition of the rebel States, the President, on the 20th of December,\r\nsent in a message which Mr. Sumner characterized as an attempt to\r\n\"whitewash\" the unhappy condition of the rebel States. The message of\r\nthe President was accompanied by reports from General Grant and\r\nGeneral Schurz, in which Congress found evidence that the late rebels\r\nhad little sense of national obligation, and were chiefly anxious to\r\nregain political power, and compensate themselves for the loss of\r\nslavery by keeping the negroes in abject servitude.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, by a large majority in\r\nCongress, and its veto by the President, presents the next phase in\r\nthe contest. To Republicans the most alarming feature in the Veto\r\nMessage was the evidence it gave that the President was ready at once\r\nto give to traitors who had fought fiercely for four years to destroy\r\nthe Union an equal voice with loyal men in determining the terms of\r\nits reconstruction.\r\n\r\nIn this instance the President prevailed. The bill failed to pass over\r\nthe veto, from the fact that six Senators--Dixon, Doolittle, Morgan,\r\nNorton, Stewart, and Van Winkle--who had voted for the bill, now sided\r\nwith the President. This was the first and last triumph of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, on the 22d of February, the President greatly damaged\r\nhis cause by denouncing a Senator and a Representative, and using the\r\nslang of the stump against the Secretary of the Senate in the midst of\r\nan uproarious Washington mob. The people were mortified that the\r\nExecutive of the nation should have committed so serious an\r\nindiscretion.\r\n\r\nThe incident received notice in Congress in a humorous speech of\r\nThaddeus Stevens, who declared that the alleged speech could never\r\nhave been delivered; that it was \"a part of the cunning contrivance of\r\nthe copperhead party, who have been persecuting our President;\" that\r\nit was \"one of the grandest hoaxes ever perpetrated.\"\r\n\r\nCongress, now aware that it must achieve its greatest works of\r\nlegislation over the obstructing veto of the President, moved forward\r\nwith caution and deliberation. Every measure was well weighed and\r\ncarefully matured, since, in order to win its way to the favor of a\r\ntriumphant majority in Congress and the country, it must be as free as\r\npossible from all objectionable features.\r\n\r\nImpartial suffrage, as provided in the District of Columbia Suffrage\r\nBill, being a subject upon which the people had not yet spoken, the\r\nSenate determined that it would be better not to risk the uncertainty\r\nof passing the measure over the inevitable veto until the people\r\nshould have an opportunity of speaking at the ballot-box.\r\n\r\nThe President applied his veto to the Civil Rights Bill and the second\r\nFreedmen's Bureau Bill, but a majority of more than the requisite\r\ntwo-thirds placed these measures among the laws of the land. In the\r\nHouse of Representatives, Mr. Raymond was the only Republican member\r\nwho voted to sustain the veto of the Civil Rights Bill. The temptation\r\nto be friends of the President, in order to aid him in the\r\ndistribution of patronage, was very great with members of Congress,\r\nand the wonder is that so many were able to reject it all, and adhere\r\nto principles against which the Executive brought to bear all his\r\npower of opposition.\r\n\r\nOn the adjournment of Congress in July, at the close of the first\r\nsession, the contest was still continued, though in another arena.\r\nMembers of Congress went to their several districts, submitted their\r\ndoings to their constituents, and took counsel of the people. The\r\nPresident also traversed the States from the Atlantic to the\r\nMississippi. He made numerous speeches, and endeavored to popularize\r\nhis policy.\r\n\r\nThe people gave their verdict at the ballot-box in favor of Congress.\r\nThe reëlection of Congress was the rejection of the President. The\r\nruin of the President's fortunes was shared by his followers. No\r\ngentleman ever entered the House of Representatives with more _eclat_\r\nthan that with which Mr. Raymond took his seat as a member of the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress, but his constituents did not see proper to\r\nelect him for a second term. Delano and Stillwell, of the West, were\r\nleft at home. Cowan, in the Senate, elected six years before as a\r\nRepublican, was superseded, and Doolittle was instructed by his\r\nLegislature to resign.\r\n\r\nThe message of the President at the opening of the second session\r\ndisplayed no disposition to yield to the people or to Congress. He\r\ndeclared to a State delegation that waited on him that he was too old\r\nto learn.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of Congress after reässembling was to accept the\r\nsanction of the people for impartial suffrage, and pass the District\r\nSuffrage Bill over the President's veto. The President deemed it due\r\nto his consistency to return bills, with his \"objections thereto in\r\nwriting,\" to the very last. Among the last doings of the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress was the passage of the Tenure-of-office Bill and the Military\r\nReconstruction Bill over vetoes. In humiliating contrast with the\r\ncircumstances one year before, when the veto of the Freedmen's Bureau\r\nBill prevailed, the veto of the Military Reconstruction Bill had but\r\nten supporters in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe following is a complete list of the bills vetoed by the President\r\nduring the Thirty-ninth Congress, and of the bills which were passed\r\nover the veto, and those which became laws without the President's\r\nsignature:\r\n\r\n     FIRST SESSION.--To enlarge the powers of the Freedmen's\r\n     Bureau; vetoed February 19, 1866.\r\n\r\n     To protect all persons in the United States in their civil\r\n     rights, and furnish the means of their vindication; vetoed;\r\n     and passed, April 9, 1866, over veto.\r\n\r\n     For the admission of the State of Colorado into the Union;\r\n     vetoed May, 1866.\r\n\r\n     To enable the Montana and New York Iron Mining and\r\n     Manufacturing Company to purchase a certain amount of the\r\n     public lands not now in market; vetoed June, 1866.\r\n\r\n     To continue in force and to amend an act entitled \"an act to\r\n     establish a bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees,\r\n     and for other purposes;\" vetoed; passed, July 16, 1866, over\r\n     veto.\r\n\r\n     For the admission of the State of Nebraska into the Union;\r\n     not signed; failed through the adjournment of Congress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     SECOND SESSION.--To regulate the elective franchise in the\r\n     District of Columbia; vetoed; passed, January 8, 1867, over\r\n     veto.\r\n\r\n     To admit the State of Colorado into the Union; vetoed\r\n     January 18, 1867.\r\n\r\n     For the admission of the State of Nebraska into the Union;\r\n     vetoed; passed, February 9, 1867, over veto.\r\n\r\n     To provide for the more efficient government of the\r\n     insurrectionary States; vetoed; passed, March 2, 1867, over\r\n     veto.\r\n\r\n     To regulate the tenure of office; vetoed; passed, March 2,\r\n     1867, over veto.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Bills which became laws without the President's signature,\r\n     the constitutional limit of ten days having expired without\r\n     their return:_\r\n\r\n     To repeal section 13 of \"an act to suppress insurrection, to\r\n     punish treason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the\r\n     property of rebels, and for other purposes,\" approved July\r\n     17, 1862; became a law January 22, 1867.\r\n\r\n     To regulate the franchise in the Territories of the United\r\n     States; became a law January 31, 1867.\r\n\r\n     To regulate the duties of the Clerk of the House of\r\n     Representatives, in preparing for the organization of the\r\n     House, and for other purposes; became a law February 20,\r\n     1867.\r\n\r\n     To declare the sense of an act entitled \"an act to restrict\r\n     the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, and to provide for\r\n     the payment of certain demands for quartermasters' stores\r\n     and subsistence supplies furnished to the army of the United\r\n     States;\" became a law February 22; 1867.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     RECAPITULATION.--Vetoes, 10; pocket vetoes, 1; laws passed\r\n     over vetoes, 6; vetoes sustained, 4; became laws without\r\n     signature, 4.\r\n\r\nAs President Johnson proceeded in his career of opposition to the\r\nlegislative branch of the Government, the conviction fastened upon the\r\nminds of some that he was guilty of crimes rendering him liable to\r\nimpeachment. On the 7th of January, 1867, Hon. James M. Ashley, of\r\nOhio, brought before the House of Representatives articles of\r\nimpeachment, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"I do impeach Andrew Johnson, Vice-President and acting\r\n     President of the United States, of high crimes and\r\n     misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n     \"I charge him with a usurpation of power and violation of\r\n     law:\r\n\r\n     \"In that he has corruptly used the appointing power;\r\n\r\n     \"In that he has corruptly used the pardoning power;\r\n\r\n     \"In that he has corruptly used the veto power;\r\n\r\n     \"In that he has corruptly disposed of public property of the\r\n     United States;\r\n\r\n     \"In that he has corruptly interfered in elections, and\r\n     committed acts which, in contemplation of the Constitution,\r\n     are high crimes and misdemeanors; Therefore,\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it resolved_, That the Committee on the Judiciary be,\r\n     and they are hereby, authorized to inquire into the official\r\n     conduct of Andrew Johnson, Vice-President of the United\r\n     States, discharging the powers and duties of the office of\r\n     President of the United States, and to report to this House\r\n     whether, in their opinion, the said Andrew Johnson, while in\r\n     said office, has been guilty of acts which are designed or\r\n     calculated to overthrow, subvert, or corrupt the Government\r\n     of the United States, or any department or office thereof;\r\n     and whether the said Andrew Johnson has been guilty of any\r\n     act, or has conspired with others to do acts, which, in\r\n     contemplation of the Constitution, are high crimes and\r\n     misdemeanors, requiring the interposition of the\r\n     constitutional power of this House; and that said committee\r\n     have power to send for persons and papers, and to administer\r\n     the customary oath to witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was adopted by a vote of one hundred and eight to\r\nthirty-eight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hon. James M. Ashley.]\r\n\r\nNear the close of the session, the Committee on the Judiciary, having\r\nin charge the question of impeachment, made a report. The condition in\r\nwhich the subject was left by the Thirty-ninth Congress will be seen\r\nfrom the following extract:\r\n\r\n     \"The duty imposed upon the committee by this action of the\r\n     House was of the highest and gravest character. No\r\n     committee, during the entire history of the Government, has\r\n     ever been charged with a more important trust. The\r\n     responsibility which it imposed was of oppressive weight and\r\n     of most unpleasant nature. Gladly would the committee have\r\n     escaped from the arduous labor imposed upon it by the\r\n     resolution of the House; but once imposed, prompt,\r\n     deliberate, and faithful action, with a view to correct\r\n     results, became its duty, and to this end it has directed\r\n     its efforts.\r\n\r\n     \"Soon after the adoption of the resolution by the House, the\r\n     Hon. James M. Ashley communicated to the committee, in\r\n     support of his charges against the President of the United\r\n     States, such facts as were in his possession, and the\r\n     investigation was proceeded with, and has been continued\r\n     almost without a day's interruption. A large number of\r\n     witnesses have been examined, many documents collected, and\r\n     every thing done which could be done to reach a conclusion\r\n     of the case. But the investigation covers a broad field,\r\n     embraces many novel, interesting, and important questions,\r\n     and involves a multitude of facts, while most of the\r\n     witnesses are distant from the capital, owing to which, the\r\n     committee, in view of the magnitude of the interests\r\n     involved in its action, has not been able to conclude its\r\n     labors, and is not, therefore, prepared to submit a definite\r\n     and final report. If the investigation had even approached\r\n     completeness, the committee would not feel authorized to\r\n     present the result to the House at this late period of the\r\n     session, unless the charge had been so entirely negatived as\r\n     to admit of no discussion, which, in the opinion of the\r\n     committee, is not the case. Certainly, no affirmative report\r\n     could be properly considered in the expiring hours of this\r\n     Congress.\r\n\r\n     \"The committee, not having fully investigated all the\r\n     charges preferred against the President of the United\r\n     States, it is deemed inexpedient to submit any conclusion\r\n     beyond the statement that sufficient testimony has been\r\n     brought to its notice to justify and demand a further\r\n     prosecution of the investigation.\r\n\r\n     \"The testimony which the committee has taken will pass into\r\n     the custody of the Clerk of the House, and can go into the\r\n     hands of such committee as may be charged with the duty of\r\n     bringing this investigation to a close, so that the labor\r\n     expended upon it may not have been in vain.\r\n\r\n     \"The committee regrets its inability definitely to dispose\r\n     of the important subject committed to its charge, and\r\n     presents this report for its own justification, and for the\r\n     additional purpose of notifying the succeeding Congress of\r\n     the incompleteness of its labors, and that they should be\r\n     completed.\"\r\n\r\nWith the acceptance of this report, the impeachment was at an end so\r\nfar as the action of the Thirty-ninth Congress was concerned. The\r\nsubject was handed over to the consideration of the Fortieth Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL.\r\n\r\n     Contested Seats -- Mr. Stockton votes for Himself -- New\r\n     Jersey's loss of two Senators -- Losses of Vermont --\r\n     Suicide of James H. Lane -- Death in the House -- General\r\n     Scott -- Lincoln's Eulogy and Statue -- Mr. Sumner on Fine\r\n     Arts in the Capitol -- Censure of Mr. Chanler -- Petition\r\n     for the expulsion of Garret Davis -- Grinnell assaulted by\r\n     Rousseau -- The Action of the House -- Leader of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatters of interest relating to the members of the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress remain to be noticed. Some names of members appear in the\r\nopening scenes of Congress which were substituted by others before the\r\nclose. This was occasioned partly through successful contests for\r\nseats by persons who, after an investigation of their claims, were\r\ndeclared to have been legally elected, but failed, through fraud or\r\nmistake, to receive their credentials. The right of Mr. Voorhees, of\r\nIndiana, to a seat in the Thirty-ninth Congress was contested by Henry\r\nD. Washburn. The testimony in this case was laid before the Committee\r\non Elections early in the session, and after patient hearing of the\r\nparties and careful consideration of the subject, the committee\r\nreported in favor of Mr. Washburn and unseated Mr. Voorhees.\r\n\r\nThe seat in Congress taken at the opening of the session by James\r\nBrooks, of New York, was decided by the committee, after consideration\r\nof the claims of the contestant, to belong to William E. Dodge, a\r\nmerchant of New York city.\r\n\r\nThe right of John P. Stockton, of New Jersey, to a seat in the Senate\r\nhaving been disputed on account of irregularity in his election, the\r\nSenate came to a vote on the question, after considerable discussion,\r\non the 23d of March, 1866. Mr. Stockton was declared entitled to his\r\nplace by the close vote of 22 to 21, he giving the decisive vote in\r\nfavor of himself. There arose a very exciting debate as to the right\r\nof a Senator to vote for himself under such circumstances. Mr.\r\nStockton finally yielded to the arguments against his right to sit in\r\njudgment on his own case, and he was unseated March 27th by a vote of\r\n22 to 21. For a time the seat thus vacated, to which New Jersey was\r\nentitled in the Senate, remained unoccupied on account of the refusal\r\nof the Republican Speaker of the New Jersey Senate to give his vote in\r\nfavor of the nominee of the Union caucus, Mr. Cattell. On account of\r\nthe nearly equal balance of the parties, the choice was long deferred,\r\nbut eventually made in favor of Mr. Cattell. The other seat held by\r\nNew Jersey in the Senate was practically vacant for a considerable\r\ntime on account of the illness of its incumbent, Mr. William Wright,\r\nwho consequently resigned and eventually died before the expiration of\r\nthe Thirty-ninth Congress.\r\n\r\nOther seats in Congress were vacated by death. Of all the States,\r\nVermont suffered most severely in this respect. A part of the\r\nproceedings of the Thirty-ninth Congress consists of funeral addresses\r\nand eulogies upon Judge Collamer, a distinguished Senator from\r\nVermont, whose term of service, had he lived, would have expired with\r\nthe close of this Congress. He died, lamented by the nation, on the\r\n8th of November, 1865. One who took a prominent part in the funeral\r\nobsequies of Mr. Collamer was Solomon Foot, the surviving Senator from\r\nVermont. A man termed, from his length of service, \"the father of the\r\nSenate,\" long its presiding officer, of purest morals, incorruptible\r\nintegrity, and faithful industry, he died universally lamented on the\r\n28th of March, 1866. Mr. Foot's death created a profound impression,\r\nsince it exhibited, in a most remarkable manner, the effect of\r\nChristianity in affording its possessor a happy close of life.\r\n\r\nThe death of another Senator stands forth in striking contrast with\r\nthat of Mr. Foot. On the first of July, 1866, Senator James H. Lane\r\nshot himself at Leavenworth, Kansas. While on his way home from\r\nWashington, when at St. Louis, he had intimated a determination to\r\ncommit suicide. His friends watched him closely, and obtained\r\npossession of his pocket-knife lest he might use it for the fatal\r\npurpose. Mr. Lane having reached Leavenworth, two of his friends\r\ninvited him to ride with them on Sabbath afternoon. After getting into\r\nthe carriage, he expressed a desire to return to his room for his\r\ncane, refusing to allow any one to go for him. Mr. Lane having\r\nreturned with his cane, they drove to the heights overlooking the\r\ncity. He entered cheerfully into the conversation, remarking upon the\r\nbeauty of the city and landscape. On returning, they had to pass\r\nthrough a gate that separated two fields. One of the gentlemen\r\nalighted to open the gate. At the same time Mr. Lane stepped down from\r\nthe carriage, and, passing around behind it, said, \"Good-by,\r\ngentlemen,\" and instantly discharged a pistol with its muzzle in his\r\nmouth. The ball passed out at the top of his head, near the center of\r\nthe skull, producing a fatal wound. The unhappy man lingered for a few\r\ndays in a state of unconsciousness and died. Thus ended the stirring,\r\ntroubled life of one who as a politician had occupied no\r\ninconsiderable space in the public eye.\r\n\r\nA number of seats in the House of Representatives were vacated by\r\ndeath. James Humphrey, an able and honored member from New York, died\r\nin Brooklyn on the 16th of June, 1866. During the second session of\r\nthe Thirty-ninth Congress, two members of the House of Representatives\r\nwere removed by death--Philip Johnson, of Pennsylvania, in his third\r\nterm of Congressional service, and Henry Grider, of Kentucky, a\r\nveteran member, who, having served in Congress from 1843 to 1847, was\r\nmore recently a member of the Thirty-seventh, Thirty-eighth, and\r\nThirty-ninth Congresses.\r\n\r\nCongress was called upon to pay funeral honors to others than its\r\nmembers. The death of General Scott, so long the illustrious chief of\r\nthe military establishment of the nation, was regarded with due\r\nsolemnity and honor by Congress, who deputized a large committee to\r\nattend the funeral obsequies at West Point. An equestrian statue of\r\nthe distinguished General was voted by Congress to adorn the public\r\ngrounds of the national capital.\r\n\r\nThe name of Abraham Lincoln, the nation's martyred President, was\r\nalways pronounced with profoundest respect and sincerest gratitude in\r\nthe halls of Congress. His birthday, February 12th, was celebrated by\r\nthe adjournment of Congress, and such an assembly as the hall of\r\nRepresentatives has rarely witnessed, to hear a eulogy pronounced by\r\nMr. Bancroft, the American historian. An appropriation of ten thousand\r\ndollars was made to pay a young artist, Miss Minnie Ream, to model a\r\nstatue of Abraham Lincoln. This proposition elicited an animated\r\ndiscussion, and was the occasion of a most interesting address by Mr.\r\nSumner on Art in the Capitol. \"Surely this edifice,\" said he, \"so\r\nbeautiful and interesting, should not be opened to the experiments of\r\nuntried talent. Only the finished artists should be invited to its\r\nornamentation.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I doubt if you consider enough the character of this edifice in\r\nwhich we are now assembled. Possessing the advantage of an\r\nincomparable situation, it is one of the first-class structures in the\r\nworld. Surrounded by an amphitheater of hills, with the Potomac at its\r\nfeet, it resembles the capitol in Rome, surrounded by the Alban hills,\r\nwith the Tiber at its feet. But the situation is grander than that of\r\nthe Roman capitol. The edifice itself is worthy of the situation. It\r\nhas beauty of form and sublimity in proportions, even if it lacks\r\noriginality in conception. In itself it is a work of art. It ought not\r\nto receive in the way of ornamentation any thing which is not a work\r\nof art. Unhappily this rule has not always prevailed, or there would\r\nnot be so few pictures and marbles about us worthy of the place they\r\noccupy. But bad pictures and ordinary marbles should warn us against\r\nadding to their number.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps no Congress in the history of the country presents fewer\r\ndisagreeable incidents of a personal nature than this. The Democrats\r\nin Congress being in such a small minority as to be unable to _do_ any\r\nthing effectual either to impede or advance legislation, could only\r\npresent their vain protests in words. Chafing under the difficulties\r\nthey encountered, it is not surprising that at times they used\r\nlanguage so ill-timed and unparliamentary as to call forth the censure\r\nof the House.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, Mr. Chanler, of New York, submitted a resolution\r\n\"that the independent, patriotic, and constitutional course of the\r\nPresident of the United States, in seeking to protect, by the veto\r\npower, the rights of the people of this Union against the wicked and\r\nrevolutionary acts of a few malignant and mischievous men meets with\r\nthe approval of this House, and deserves the cordial support of all\r\nloyal citizens of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nFor introducing this resolution, the House voted to censure Mr.\r\nChanler as having \"attempted a gross insult to the House.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the vote was taken, Mr. Chanler said: \"If by my defiance I\r\ncould drive your party from this hall, I would do so; if by my vote I\r\ncould crush you, I would do so, and put the whole party, with your\r\nleader, the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevens], into that\r\npolitical hell surrounded by bayonets referred to by him in his\r\nargument on Thursday last.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Senate a petition was presented from citizens of New York\r\npraying that Garret Davis be expelled from the Senate, and, \"with\r\nother traitors, held to answer to the law for his crime, since he\r\nstood in the attitude of an avowed enemy of the Government\"--since he\r\nhad made the declaration in reference to the Civil Rights Bill \"that\r\nif the bill should become a law, he should feel compelled to regard\r\nhimself as an enemy of the Government, and to work for its overthrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" replied Mr. Davis, \"that I used in substance the words\r\nthat are imputed to me in that petition; but, as a part of their\r\ncontext, I used a great many more. As an example of garbling, the\r\npetition reminds me of a specimen that I heard when I was a young man.\r\nIt was to this effect: 'The Bible teaches \"that there is no God.\"'\r\nWhen those words were read in connection with the context, the passage\r\nread in about these terms: 'The fool hath said in his heart that there\r\nis no God.' That specimen of the Bible was about as fair as this\r\ngarbled statement is of what I said upon the matter to which it\r\nrefers.\"\r\n\r\nThe most serious subject coming up for the censure of the House was an\r\nassault made by Mr. Rousseau, of Kentucky, upon Mr. Grinnell, of Iowa.\r\nIn many of its features this incident resembles the \"affairs\" of a\r\npersonal character which were of frequent occurrence when Southern\r\nmembers were in Congress before the war. In February, 1866, Mr.\r\nRousseau, in the course of a speech on the Freedmen's Bureau Bill,\r\nmade the remark, \"If you intend to arrest white people on the _ex\r\nparte_ statement of negroes, and hold them to suit your convenience\r\nfor trial, and fine and imprison them, then I say that I oppose you;\r\nand if you should so arrest and punish me, I would kill you when you\r\nset me at liberty.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Grinnell replied, \"I care not whether the gentleman was\r\nfour years in the war on the Union side or four years on the other\r\nside, but I say that he degraded his State and uttered a sentiment I\r\nthought unworthy of an American officer when he said that he would do\r\nsuch an act on the complaint of a negro against him.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Rousseau, on the following day, replied: \"I pronounce the\r\nassertion that I have degraded my State and uttered a sentiment\r\nunworthy an American officer to be false, a vile slander, and unworthy\r\nto be uttered by any gentleman upon this floor.\"\r\n\r\nSome months after this, Mr. Rousseau, in a public speech delivered in\r\nNew York city, denounced Mr. Grinnell as a \"pitiable politician from\r\nIowa.\" In a speech made in the House on the 11th of June, Mr. Rousseau\r\nsaid of Mr. Grinnell: \"I do not suppose that any member of this House\r\nbelieved a word he said. When a member can so far depart from what\r\nevery body believes he ought to know and does know is the truth, it is\r\na degradation, not to his State, but to himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"When any man,\" replied Mr. Grinnell--\"I care not whether he stands\r\nsix feet high, whether he wears buff and carries the air of a certain\r\nbird that has a more than usual extremity of tail, wanting in the\r\nother extremity--says that he would not believe what I utter, I will\r\nsay that I was never born to stand under an imputation of that sort.\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman begins courting sympathy by sustaining the President of\r\nthe United States preparatory to his assault upon me. Now, sir, if he\r\nis a defender of the President of the United States, all I have to say\r\nis, God save the President from such an incoherent, brainless\r\ndefender, equal in valor in civil and in military life. His military\r\nrecord--who has read it? In what volume of history is it found?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rousseau determined to resent the insult which he conceived to be\r\noffered him in this speech by inflicting a bodily chastisement upon\r\nMr. Grinnell. On the morning of June 14th, Mr. Rousseau informed a\r\nmilitary friend of his purpose of flogging Mr. Grinnell. The person so\r\ninformed procured a pistol and waited in the capitol until the close\r\nof the day's session, in order to be present at the flogging and see\r\n\"fair play.\" Two other friends of Mr. Rousseau, also armed with\r\npistols, happened to be present when the scene transpired. While Mr.\r\nGrinnell was passing from the House through the east portico of the\r\ncapitol, he was met by Mr. Rousseau, who, in an excited manner, said,\r\n\"I have waited four days for an apology for words spoken here upon\r\nthis floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of that?\" asked Mr. Grinnell.\r\n\r\n\"I will teach you what of that,\" said Mr. Rousseau, who then proceeded\r\nto strike Mr. Grinnell about the head and shoulders with a rattan,\r\nstopping occasionally to lecture him, and saying, \"Now, you d----d\r\npuppy and poltroon, look at yourself.\"\r\n\r\nAfter receiving half a dozen blows, Mr. Grinnell exclaimed, \"I don't\r\nwant to hurt you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't expect you to hurt me, you d----d scoundrel,\" said Mr.\r\nRousseau, \"but you tried to injure me upon the floor of the House. And\r\nnow look at yourself; whipped here; whipped like a dog, disgraced and\r\ndegraded! Where are your one hundred and twenty-seven thousand\r\nconstituents now?\"\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed to investigate this disgraceful affair. In\r\njust one month after the transaction, a report was presented, signed\r\nby Messrs. Spalding, Banks, and Thayer, stating the facts in the case,\r\nand recommending the expulsion of Mr. Rousseau. They also proposed a\r\nresolution to express disapproval of the reflections made by Mr.\r\nGrinnell upon the character of Mr. Rousseau. The \"views of the\r\nminority\" were also presented by Messrs. Raymond and Hogan. They\r\nrecommended that the punishment of Mr. Rousseau should be a public\r\nreprimand by the Speaker. After protracted discussion, the House came\r\nto a final decision. The motion to expel, requiring two-thirds, failed\r\nby a few votes. The motion by which the Speaker was directed to\r\npublicly reprimand Mr. Rousseau was carried by a vote of 89 to 30.\r\nThere were not enough in favor of the motion to disapprove of Mr.\r\nGrinnell's remarks to call the ayes and noes. Mr. Rousseau endeavored\r\nto evade the execution of the sentence by sending his resignation to\r\nthe Governor of Kentucky. The House declared that a member could not\r\ndissolve his connection with the body under such circumstances,\r\nwithout its consent. On the 21st of July, the execution of the order\r\nwas of the House having been demanded, Mr. Rousseau appeared at the\r\nbar, when the Speaker said, \"General Rousseau, the House of\r\nRepresentatives have declared you guilty of a violation of its rights\r\nand privileges in a premeditated personal assault upon a member for\r\nwords spoken in debate. This condemnation they have placed on their\r\njournal, and have ordered that you shall be publicly reprimanded by\r\nthe Speaker at the bar of the House. No words of mine can add to the\r\nforce of this order, in obedience to which I now pronounce upon you\r\nits reprimand.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the second session of the Thirty-ninth Congress, an\r\ninteresting case came up relating to the privileges and immunities of\r\na member of Congress. Charles V. Culver, Representative of the\r\nTwentieth District of Pennsylvania, having been engaged very\r\nextensively in banking, made a failure in business. In June, 1866,\r\nduring the session of Congress, one of his creditors caused his arrest\r\nupon a contract for the return of certain bonds and notes alleged to\r\nhave been lent to him, charging that the debt incurred thereby was\r\nfraudulently contracted by Culver. In default of required security,\r\nMr. Culver was committed to jail, where he remained until the 18th of\r\nDecember. Mr. Culver claimed his immunity as a member of Congress,\r\nunder the clause of the Constitution which provides that Senators and\r\nRepresentatives \"shall in all cases, except treason, felony, and\r\nbreach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance\r\nat the sessions of their respective houses, and in going to and\r\nreturning from the same.\" The judge decided that the offense fell\r\nunder the constitutional exception, and was to be regarded as a\r\n\"breach of the peace.\" From this remarkable decision an appeal was\r\nmade to the House of Representatives itself, as \"the highest court of\r\nthe nation, and depository of its supreme authority.\" The case was\r\nreferred to the Judiciary Committee, who reported a resolution,\r\nunanimously adopted by the House, directing the Speaker to issue his\r\nwarrant to the Sergeant-at-Arms, commanding him to deliver forthwith\r\nCharles V. Culver from the custody of the sheriff and jailor of\r\nVenango County, and make return to the House of the warrant, and the\r\nmanner in which he may have executed the same. The Sergeant-at-Arms\r\nproceeded immediately to execute the order of the House, and in a\r\nshort time the Speaker announced that Mr. Culver was unrestrained in\r\nhis seat as a member of the Thirty-ninth Congress.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous distinguished men who constituted the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress, no one towered so conspicuously above the rest as to be\r\nuniversally recognized and followed as the \"leader.\" This title has\r\nbeen frequently applied to Thaddeus Stevens. He was in many respects\r\nthe most prominent figure in the Thirty-ninth Congress. His age, his\r\nlong fidelity to the principles of the Republican party, his\r\nuncompromising spirit, and his force of character made him a\r\nconspicuous and influential member of the House, but did not cause him\r\nto be generally recognized or implicitly followed as a leader.\r\n\r\nIn so large a legislative body, composed of so many men of independent\r\nthought and action, acknowledging no parliamentary leader, it is\r\nremarkable that the wheels of legislation should run so smoothly, and\r\nthat after all the disagreement in discussion, great results should be\r\nat last so harmoniously wrought out. This is partly due to the\r\npatriotic spirit which pervaded the minds of its members, inducing\r\nthem to lay aside minor differences of opinion for the good of that\r\ncommon country for which their constituents had lately made such\r\ntremendous sacrifice. The result is also owing to the parliamentary\r\nability and tact of him who sat patiently and faithfully as Speaker of\r\nthe House. Deprived by his position of opportunity of taking part in\r\nthe discussions, which his genius and experience fitted him to\r\nillustrate, he nevertheless did much to direct the current of\r\nlegislation which flowed smoothly or turbidly before him. The\r\nresolution of thanks to the Speaker, moved by a member of the\r\nminority, and passed unanimously by the House, was no unmeaning\r\ncompliment, but was an honor fairly earned and justly paid.\r\n\r\nThe labor of presiding over the Senate--a much lighter task, owing to\r\nthe smaller number which composed the body--was faithfully performed\r\nby Mr. Foster. His remarks to the Senate on retiring from the chair as\r\nPresident _pro tempore_, and closing a career of twelve years as a\r\nmember of the body, were most beautiful and impressive.\r\n\r\nBenjamin F. Wade, \"a Senator from Ohio,\" having been duly elected\r\nPresident _pro tempore_ of the Senate, took the \"iron-clad oath\" and\r\nassumed his seat as acting Vice-President of the United States without\r\nostentation or remark.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock noon of March 4, 1867, the Thirty-ninth Congress\r\nclosed its existence, handing over its great enactments to the\r\ncountry, and its unfinished business to its successor, which\r\nimmediately came into life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL INDEX OF THE THIRTY-NINTH CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n(The numbers appended to the following sketches refer to preceding\r\npages of the book.)\r\n\r\n[The names of Republicans are printed in ROMAN; of Democrats in\r\n_ITALICS_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN B.
