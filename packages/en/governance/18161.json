This language is, indeed, of necessary use in the executive\r\ndepartments of the Company's affairs; but it is not necessary to\r\nParliament. A language so foreign from all the ideas and habits of the\r\nfar greater part of the members of this House has a tendency to disgust\r\nthem with all sorts of inquiry concerning this subject. They are\r\nfatigued into such a despair of ever obtaining a competent knowledge of\r\nthe transactions in India, that they are easily persuaded to remand them\r\nback to that obscurity, mystery, and intrigue out of which they have\r\nbeen forced upon public notice by the calamities arising from their\r\nextreme mismanagement. This mismanagement has itself, as your Committee\r\nconceive, in a great measure arisen from dark cabals, and secret\r\nsuggestions to persons in power, without a regular public inquiry into\r\nthe good or evil tendency of any measure, or into the merit or demerit\r\nof any person intrusted with the Company's concerns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Present laws relating to the East India Company, and internal\r\nand external policy.]\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted by your Committee is, first, to consider the law\r\nregulating the East India Company, as it now stands,--and, secondly, to\r\ninquire into the circumstances of the two great links of connection by\r\nwhich the territorial possessions in India are united to this kingdom,\r\nnamely, the Company's commerce, and the government exercised under the\r\ncharter and under acts of Parliament. The last [first] of these objects,\r\nthe commerce, is taken in two points of view: the _external_, or the\r\ndirect trade between India and Europe, and the _internal_, that is to\r\nsay, the trade of Bengal, in all the articles of produce and manufacture\r\nwhich furnish the Company's investment.\r\n\r\nThe government is considered by your Committee under the like\r\ndescriptions of internal and external. The internal regards the\r\ncommunication between the Court of Directors and their servants in\r\nIndia, the management of the revenue, the expenditure of public money,\r\nthe civil administration, the administration of justice, and the state\r\nof the army. The external regards, first, the conduct and maxims of the\r\nCompany's government with respect to the native princes and people\r\ndependent on the British authority,--and, next, the proceedings with\r\nregard to those native powers which are wholly independent of the\r\nCompany. But your Committee's observations on the last division extend\r\nto those matters only which are not comprehended in the Report of the\r\nCommittee of Secrecy. Under these heads, your Committee refer to the\r\nmost leading particulars of abuse which prevail in the administration of\r\nIndia,--deviating only from this order where the abuses are of a\r\ncomplicated nature, and where one cannot be well considered\r\nindependently of several others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second attempt made by Parliament for a reformation.]\r\n\r\nYour Committee observe, that this is the second attempt made by\r\nParliament for the reformation of abuses in the Company's government. It\r\nappears, therefore, to them a necessary preliminary to this second\r\nundertaking, _to consider the causes which, in their opinion_, have\r\nproduced the failure of the first,--that the defects of the original\r\nplan may be supplied, its errors corrected, and such useful regulations\r\nas were then adopted may be further explained, enlarged, and enforced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proceedings of session 1773.]\r\n\r\nThe first design of this kind was formed in the session of the year\r\n1773. In that year, Parliament, taking up the consideration of the\r\naffairs of India, through two of its committees collected a very great\r\nbody of details concerning the interior economy of the Company's\r\npossessions, and concerning many particulars of abuse which prevailed at\r\nthe time when those committees made their ample and instructive reports.\r\nBut it does not appear that the body of regulations enacted in that\r\nyear, that is, in the East India Act of the thirteenth of his Majesty's\r\nreign, were altogether grounded on that information, but were adopted\r\nrather on probable speculations and general ideas of good policy and\r\ngood government. New establishments, civil and judicial, were therefore\r\nformed at a very great expense, and with much complexity of\r\nconstitution. Checks and counter-checks of all kinds were contrived in\r\nthe execution, as well as in the formation of this system, in which all\r\nthe existing authorities of this kingdom had a share: for Parliament\r\nappointed the members of the presiding part of the new establishment,\r\nthe Crown appointed the judicial, and the Company preserved the\r\nnomination of the other officers. So that, if the act has not fully\r\nanswered its purposes, the failure cannot be attributed to any want of\r\nofficers of every description, or to the deficiency of any mode of\r\npatronage in their appointment. The cause must be sought elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers and objects of act of 1773, and the effects thereof.]\r\n\r\nThe act had in its view (independently of several detached regulations)\r\nfive fundamental objects.\r\n\r\n1st. The reformation of the Court of Proprietors of the East India\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n2ndly. A new model of the Court of Directors, and an enforcement of\r\ntheir authority over the servants abroad.\r\n\r\n3rdly. The establishment of a court of justice capable of protecting the\r\nnatives from the oppressions of British subjects.\r\n\r\n4thly. The establishment of a general council, to be seated in Bengal,\r\nwhose authority should, in many particulars, extend over all the British\r\nsettlements in India.\r\n\r\n5thly. To furnish the ministers of the crown with constant information\r\nconcerning the whole of the Company's correspondence with India, in\r\norder that they might be enabled to inspect the conduct of the Directors\r\nand servants, and to watch over the execution of all parts of the act;\r\nthat they might be furnished with matter to lay before Parliament from\r\ntime to time, according as the state of things should render regulation\r\nor animadversion necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Court of Proprietors.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New qualification.]\r\n\r\nThe first object of the policy of this act was to improve the\r\nconstitution of the Court of Proprietors. In this case, as in almost all\r\nthe rest, the remedy was not applied directly to the disease. The\r\ncomplaint was, that factions in the Court of Proprietors had shown, in\r\nseveral instances, a disposition to support the servants of the Company\r\nagainst the just coercion and legal prosecution of the Directors.\r\nInstead of applying a corrective to the distemper, a change was proposed\r\nin the constitution. By this reform, it was presumed that an interest\r\nwould arise in the General Court more independent in itself, and more\r\nconnected with the commercial prosperity of the Company. Under the new\r\nconstitution, no proprietor, not possessed of a thousand pounds capital\r\nstock, was permitted to vote in the General Court: before the act, five\r\nhundred pounds was a sufficient qualification for one vote; and no value\r\ngave more. But as the lower classes were disabled, the power was\r\nincreased in the higher: proprietors of three thousand pounds were\r\nallowed two votes; those of six thousand were entitled to three; ten\r\nthousand pounds was made the qualification for four. The votes were thus\r\nregulated in the scale and gradation of property. On this scale, and on\r\nsome provisions to prevent occasional qualifications and splitting of\r\nvotes, the whole reformation rested.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ballot.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indian interest.]\r\n\r\nSeveral essential points, however, seem to have been omitted or\r\nmisunderstood. No regulation was made to abolish the pernicious custom\r\nof voting by _ballot_, by means of which acts of the highest concern to\r\nthe Company and to the state might be done by individuals with perfect\r\nimpunity; and even the body itself might be subjected to a forfeiture of\r\nall its privileges for defaults of persons who, so far from being under\r\ncontrol, could not be so much as known in any mode of legal cognizance.\r\nNothing was done or attempted to prevent the operation of the interest\r\nof delinquent servants of the Company in the General Court, by which\r\nthey might even come to be their own judges, and, in effect, under\r\nanother description, to become the masters in that body which ought to\r\ngovern them. Nor was anything provided to secure the independency of the\r\nproprietary body from the various exterior interests by which it might\r\nbe disturbed, and diverted from the conservation of that pecuniary\r\nconcern which the act laid down as the sole security for preventing a\r\ncollusion between the General Court and the powerful delinquent servants\r\nin India. The whole of the regulations concerning the Court of\r\nProprietors relied upon two principles, which have often proved\r\nfallacious: namely, that small numbers were a security against faction\r\nand disorder; and that integrity of conduct would follow the greater\r\nproperty. In no case could these principles be less depended upon than\r\nin the affairs of the East India Company. However, by wholly cutting off\r\nthe lower, and adding to the power of the higher classes, it was\r\nsupposed that the higher would keep their money in that fund to make\r\nprofit,--that the vote would be a secondary consideration, and no more\r\nthan a guard to the property,--and that therefore any abuse which tended\r\nto depreciate the value of their stock would be warmly resented by such\r\nproprietors.\r\n\r\nIf the ill effects of every misdemeanor in the Company's servants were\r\nto be _immediate_, and had a tendency to lower the value of the stock,\r\nsomething might justly be expected from the pecuniary security taken by\r\nthe act. But from the then state of things, it was more than probable\r\nthat proceedings ruinous to the permanent interest of the Company might\r\ncommence in great lucrative advantages. Against this evil large\r\npecuniary interests were rather the reverse of a remedy. Accordingly,\r\nthe Company's servants have ever since covered over the worst\r\noppressions of the people under their government, and the most cruel and\r\nwanton ravages of all the neighboring countries, by holding out, and for\r\na time actually realizing, additions of revenue to the territorial funds\r\nof the Company, and great quantities of valuable goods to their\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proprietors.]\r\n\r\nBut this consideration of mere income, whatever weight it might have,\r\ncould not be the first object of a proprietor, in a body so\r\ncircumstanced. The East India Company is not, like the Bank of England,\r\na mere moneyed society for the sole purpose of the preservation or\r\nimprovement of their capital; and therefore every attempt to regulate it\r\nupon the same principles must inevitably fail. When it is considered\r\nthat a certain share in the stock gives a share in the government of so\r\nvast an empire, with such a boundless patronage, civil, military,\r\nmarine, commercial, and financial, in every department of which such\r\nfortunes have been made as could be made nowhere else, it is impossible\r\nnot to perceive that capitals far superior to any qualifications\r\nappointed to proprietors, or even to Directors, would readily be laid\r\nout for a participation in that power. The India proprietor, therefore,\r\nwill always be, in the first instance, a politician; and the bolder his\r\nenterprise, and the more corrupt his views, the less will be his\r\nconsideration of the price to be paid for compassing them. The new\r\nregulations did not reduce the number so low as not to leave the\r\nassembly still liable to all the disorder which might be supposed to\r\narise from multitude. But if the principle had been well established and\r\nwell executed, a much greater inconveniency grew out of the reform than\r\nthat which had attended the old abuse: for if tumult and disorder be\r\nlessened by reducing the number of proprietors, private cabal and\r\nintrigue are facilitated at least in an equal degree; and it is cabal\r\nand corruption, rather than disorder and confusion, that was most to be\r\ndreaded in transacting the affairs of India. Whilst the votes of the\r\nsmaller proprietors continued, a door was left open for the public sense\r\nto enter into that society: since that door has been closed, the\r\nproprietary has become, even more than formerly, an aggregate of private\r\ninterests, which subsist at the expense of the collective body. At the\r\nmoment of this revolution in the proprietary, as it might naturally be\r\nexpected, those who had either no very particular interest in their vote\r\nor but a petty object to pursue immediately disqualified; but those who\r\nwere deeply interested in the Company's patronage, those who were\r\nconcerned in the supply of ships and of the other innumerable objects\r\nrequired for their immense establishments, those who were engaged in\r\ncontracts with the Treasury, Admiralty, and Ordnance, together with the\r\nclerks in public offices, found means of securing qualifications at the\r\nenlarged standard. All these composed a much greater proportion than\r\nformerly they had done of the proprietary body.\r\n\r\nAgainst the great, predominant, radical corruption of the Court of\r\nProprietors the raising the qualification proved no sort of remedy. The\r\nreturn of the Company's servants into Europe poured in a constant supply\r\nof proprietors, whose ability to purchase the highest qualifications for\r\nthemselves, their agents, and dependants could not be dubious. And this\r\nlatter description form a very considerable, and by far the most active\r\nand efficient part of that body. To add to the votes, which is adding to\r\nthe power in proportion to the wealth, of men whose very offences were\r\nsupposed to consist in acts which lead to the acquisition of enormous\r\nriches, appears by no means a well-considered method of checking\r\nrapacity and oppression. In proportion as these interests prevailed, the\r\nmeans of cabal, of concealment, and of corrupt confederacy became far\r\nmore easy than before. Accordingly, there was no fault with respect to\r\nthe Company's government over its servants, charged or chargeable on the\r\nGeneral Court as it originally stood, of which since the reform it has\r\nnot been notoriously guilty. It was not, therefore, a matter of surprise\r\nto your Committee, that the General Court, so composed, has at length\r\ngrown to such a degree of contempt both of its duty and of the permanent\r\ninterest of the whole corporation as to put itself into open defiance of\r\nthe salutary admonitions of this House, given for the purpose of\r\nasserting and enforcing the legal authority of their own body over their\r\nown servants.\r\n\r\nThe failure in this part of the reform of 1773 is not stated by your\r\nCommittee as recommending a return to the ancient constitution of the\r\nCompany, which was nearly as far as the new from containing any\r\nprinciple tending to the prevention or remedy of abuses,--but to point\r\nout the probable failure of any future regulations which do not apply\r\ndirectly to the grievance, but which may be taken up as experiments to\r\nascertain theories of the operation of councils formed of greater or\r\nlesser numbers, or such as shall be composed of men of more or less\r\nopulence, or of interests of newer or longer standing, or concerning the\r\ndistribution of power to various descriptions or professions of men, or\r\nof the election to office by one authority rather than another.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Court of Directors.]\r\n\r\nThe second object of the act was the Court of Directors. Under the\r\narrangement of the year 1773 that court appeared to have its authority\r\nmuch strengthened. It was made less dependent than formerly upon its\r\nconstituents, the proprietary. The duration of the Directors in office\r\nwas rendered more permanent, and the tenure itself diversified by a\r\nvaried and intricate rotation. At the same time their authority was held\r\nhigh over their servants of all descriptions; and the only rule\r\nprescribed to the Council-General of Bengal, in the exercise of the\r\nlarge and ill-defined powers given to them, was that they were to yield\r\nobedience to the orders of the Court of Directors. As to the Court of\r\nDirectors itself, it was left with very little regulation. The custom of\r\nballot, infinitely the most mischievous in a body possessed of all the\r\nordinary executive powers, was still left; and your Committee have found\r\nthe ill effects of this practice in the course of their inquiries.\r\nNothing was done to oblige the Directors to attend to the promotion of\r\ntheir servants according to their rank and merits. In judging of those\r\nmerits nothing was done to bind them to any observation of what appeared\r\non their records. Nothing was done to compel them to prosecution or\r\ncomplaint where delinquency became visible. The act, indeed, prescribed\r\nthat no servant of the Company abroad should be eligible into the\r\ndirection until two years after his return to England. But as this\r\nregulation rather presumes than provides for an inquiry into their\r\nconduct, a very ordinary neglect in the Court of Directors might easily\r\ndefeat it, and a short remission might in this particular operate as a\r\ntotal indemnity. In fact, however, the servants have of late seldom\r\nattempted a seat in the direction,--an attempt which might possibly\r\nrouse a dormant spirit of inquiry; but, satisfied with an interest in\r\nthe proprietary, they have, through that name, brought the direction\r\nvery much under their own control.\r\n\r\nAs to the general authority of the Court of Directors, there is reason\r\nto apprehend that on the whole it was somewhat degraded by the act whose\r\nprofessed purpose was to exalt it, and that the only effect of the\r\nParliamentary sanction to their orders has been, that along with those\r\norders the law of the land has been despised and trampled under foot.\r\nThe Directors were not suffered either to nominate or to remove those\r\nwhom they were empowered to instruct; from masters they were reduced to\r\nthe situation of complainants,--a situation the imbecility of which no\r\nlaws or regulations could wholly alter; and when the Directors were\r\nafterwards restored in some degree to their ancient power, on the\r\nexpiration of the lease given to their principal servants, it became\r\nimpossible for them to recover any degree of their ancient respect, even\r\nif they had not in the mean time been so modelled as to be entirely free\r\nfrom all ambition of that sort.\r\n\r\nFrom that period the orders of the Court of Directors became to be so\r\nhabitually despised by their servants abroad, and at length to be so\r\nlittle regarded even by themselves, that this contempt of orders forms\r\nalmost the whole subject-matter of the voluminous reports of two of your\r\ncommittees. If any doubt, however, remains concerning the cause of this\r\nfatal decline of the authority of the Court of Directors, no doubt\r\nwhatsoever can remain of the fact itself, nor of the total failure of\r\none of the great leading regulations of the act of 1773.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supreme Court of Judicature.]\r\n\r\nThe third object was a new judicial arrangement, the chief purpose of\r\nwhich was to form a strong and solid security for the natives against\r\nthe wrongs and oppressions of British subjects resident in Bengal. An\r\noperose and expensive establishment of a Supreme Court was made, and\r\ncharged upon the revenues of the country. The charter of justice was by\r\nthe act left to the crown, as well as the appointment of the\r\nmagistrates. The defect in the institution seemed to be this,--that no\r\nrule was laid down, either in the act or the charter, by which the court\r\nwas to judge. No descriptions of offenders or species of delinquency\r\nwere properly ascertained, according to the nature of the place, or to\r\nthe prevalent mode of abuse. Provision was made for the administration\r\nof justice in the remotest part of Hindostan as if it were a province in\r\nGreat Britain. Your Committee have long had the constitution and conduct\r\nof this court before them, and they have not yet been able to discover\r\nvery few instances (not one that appears to them of leading importance)\r\nof relief given to the natives against the corruptions or oppressions of\r\nBritish subjects in power,--though they do find one very strong and\r\nmarked instance of the judges having employed an unwarrantable extension\r\nor application of the municipal law of England, to destroy a person of\r\nthe highest rank among those natives whom they were sent to protect. One\r\ncircumstance rendered the proceeding in this case fatal to all the good\r\npurposes for which the court had been established. The sufferer (the\r\nRajah Nundcomar) appears, at the very time of this extraordinary\r\nprosecution, a discoverer of some particulars of illicit gain then\r\ncharged upon Mr. Hastings, the Governor-General. Although in ordinary\r\ncases, and in some lesser instances of grievance, it is very probable\r\nthat this court has done its duty, and has been, as every court must be,\r\nof some service, yet one example of this kind must do more towards\r\ndeterring the natives from complaint, and consequently from the means\r\nof redress, than many decisions favorable to them, in the ordinary\r\ncourse of proceeding, can do for their encouragement and relief. So far\r\nas your Committee has been able to discover, the court has been\r\ngenerally terrible to the natives, and has distracted the government of\r\nthe Company without substantially reforming any one of its abuses.\r\n\r\nThis court, which in its constitution seems not to have had sufficiently\r\nin view the necessities of the people for whose relief it was intended,\r\nand was, or thought itself, bound in some instances to too strict an\r\nadherence to the forms and rules of English practice, in others was\r\nframed upon principles perhaps too remote from the constitution of\r\nEnglish tribunals. By the usual course of English practice, the far\r\ngreater part of the redress to be obtained against oppressions of power\r\nis by process in the nature of civil actions. In these a trial by jury\r\nis a necessary part, with regard to the finding the offence and to the\r\nassessment of the damages. Both these were in the charter of justice\r\nleft entirely to the judges. It was presumed, and not wholly without\r\nreason, that the British subjects were liable to fall into factions and\r\ncombinations, in order to support themselves in the abuses of an\r\nauthority of which every man might in his turn become a sharer. And with\r\nregard to the natives, it was presumed (perhaps a little too hastily)\r\nthat they were not capable of sharing in the functions of jurors. But it\r\nwas not foreseen that the judges were also liable to be engaged in the\r\nfactions of the settlement,--and if they should ever happen to be so\r\nengaged, that the native people were then without that remedy which\r\nobviously lay in the chance that the court and jury, though both liable\r\nto bias, might not easily unite in the same identical act of injustice.\r\nYour Committee, on full inquiry, are of opinion _that the use of juries\r\nis neither impracticable nor dangerous in Bengal_.\r\n\r\nYour Committee refer to their report made in the year 1781, for the\r\nmanner in which this court, attempting to extend its jurisdiction, and\r\nfalling with extreme severity on the native magistrates, a violent\r\ncontest arose between the English judges and the English civil\r\nauthority. This authority, calling in the military arm, (by a most\r\ndangerous example,) overpowered, and for a while suspended, the\r\nfunctions of the court; but at length those functions, which were\r\nsuspended by the quarrel of the parties, were destroyed by their\r\nreconciliation, and by the arrangements made in consequence of it. By\r\nthese the court was virtually annihilated; or if substantially it\r\nexists, it is to be apprehended it exists only for purposes very\r\ndifferent from those of its institution.\r\n\r\nThe fourth object of the act of 1773 was the Council-General. This\r\ninstitution was intended to produce uniformity, consistency, and the\r\neffective coöperation of all the settlements in their common defence. By\r\nthe ancient constitution of the Company's foreign settlements, they were\r\neach of them under the orders of a President or Chief, and a Council,\r\nmore or fewer, according to the discretion of the Company. Among those,\r\nParliament (probably on account of the largeness of the territorial\r\nacquisitions, rather than the conveniency of the situation) chose Bengal\r\nfor the residence of the controlling power, and, dissolving the\r\nPresidency, appointed a new establishment, upon a plan somewhat similar\r\nto that which had prevailed before; but the number was smaller. This\r\nestablishment was composed of a Governor-General and four Counsellors,\r\nall named in the act of Parliament. They were to hold their offices for\r\nfive years, after which term the patronage was to revert to the Court of\r\nDirectors. In the mean time such vacancies as should happen were to be\r\nfilled by that court, with the concurrence of the crown. The first\r\nGovernor-General and one of the Counsellors had been old servants of the\r\nCompany; the others were new men.\r\n\r\nOn this new arrangement the Courts of Proprietors and Directors\r\nconsidered the details of commerce as not perfectly consistent with the\r\nenlarged sphere of duty and the reduced number of the Council.\r\nTherefore, to relieve them from this burden, they instituted a new\r\noffice, called the Board of Trade, for the subordinate management of\r\ntheir commercial concerns, and appointed eleven of the senior servants\r\nto fill the commission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Object of powers to Governor-General and Council.]\r\n\r\nThe powers given by the act to the new Governor-General and Council had\r\nfor their direct object the kingdom of Bengal and its dependencies.\r\nWithin that sphere (and it is not a small one) their authority extended\r\nover all the Company's concerns of whatever description. In matters of\r\npeace and war it seems to have been meant that the other Presidencies\r\nshould be subordinate to their board. But the law is loose and\r\ndefective, where it professes to restrain the subordinate Presidencies\r\nfrom making war without the consent and approbation of the Supreme\r\nCouncil. They are left free to act without it _in cases of imminent\r\nnecessity_, or _where they shall have received special orders from the\r\nCompany_. The first exception leaves it open to the subordinate to judge\r\nof the necessity of measures which, when taken, bind or involve the\r\nsuperior: the second refers a question of peace or war to two\r\njurisdictions, which may give different judgments. In both instances\r\ncases in point have occurred.[1] With regard to their local\r\nadministration, their powers were exceedingly and dangerously loose and\r\nundetermined. Their powers were not given directly, but in words of\r\nreference, in which neither the objects related to nor the mode of the\r\nrelation were sufficiently expressed. Their legislative and executive\r\ncapacities were not so accurately drawn, and marked by such strong and\r\npenal lines of distinction, as to keep these capacities separate. Where\r\nlegislative and merely executive powers were lodged in the same hands,\r\nthe legislative, which is the larger and the more ready for all\r\noccasions, was constantly resorted to. The Governor-General and Council,\r\ntherefore, immediately gave constructions to their ill-defined authority\r\nwhich rendered it perfectly despotic,--constructions which if they were\r\nallowed, no action of theirs ought to be regarded as criminal.\r\n\r\nArmed as they were with an authority in itself so ample, and by abuse so\r\ncapable of an unlimited extent, very few, and these very insufficient\r\ncorrectives, were administered. Ample salaries were provided for them,\r\nwhich indeed removed the necessity, but by no means the inducements to\r\ncorruption and oppression. Nor was any barrier whatsoever opposed on the\r\npart of the natives against their injustice, except the Supreme Court\r\nof Judicature, which never could be capable of controlling a government\r\nwith such powers, without becoming such a government itself.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, a prohibition against all concerns in trade to the\r\nwhole Council, and against all taking of presents by any in authority. A\r\nright of prosecution in the King's Bench was also established; but it\r\nwas a right the exercise of which is difficult, and in many, and those\r\nthe most weighty cases, impracticable. No considerable facilities were\r\ngiven to prosecution in Parliament; nothing was done to prevent\r\ncomplaint from being far more dangerous to the sufferer than injustice\r\nto the oppressor. No overt acts were fixed, upon which corruption should\r\nbe presumed in transactions of which secrecy and collusion formed the\r\nvery basis; no rules of evidence nor authentic mode of transmission were\r\nsettled in conformity to the unalterable circumstances of the country\r\nand the people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Removal of servants.]\r\n\r\nOne provision, indeed, was made for restraining the servants, in itself\r\nvery wise and substantial: a delinquent once dismissed, could not be\r\nrestored, but by the votes of three fourths of the Directors and three\r\nfourths of the proprietors: this was well aimed. But no method was\r\nsettled for bringing delinquents to the question of removal: and if they\r\nshould be brought to it, a door lay wide open for evasion of the law,\r\nand for a return into the service, in defiance of its plain\r\nintention,--that is, by resigning to avoid removal; by which measure\r\nthis provision of the act has proved as unoperative as all the rest. By\r\nthis management a mere majority may bring in the greater delinquent,\r\nwhilst the person removed for offences comparatively trivial may remain\r\nexcluded forever.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Council-General]\r\n\r\nThe new Council nominated in the act was composed of two totally\r\ndiscordant elements, which soon distinguished themselves into permanent\r\nparties. One of the principal instructions which the three members of\r\nthe Council sent immediately from England, namely, General Clavering,\r\nColonel Monson, and Mr. Francis, carried out with them was, to \"_cause\r\nthe strictest inquiry to be made into all oppressions and abuses_,\"\r\namong which _the practice of receiving presents from the natives_, at\r\nthat time generally charged upon men in power, was principally aimed at.\r\n\r\nPresents to any considerable value were justly reputed by the\r\nlegislature, not as marks of attention and respect, but as bribes or\r\nextortions, for which either the beneficial and gratuitous duties of\r\ngovernment were sold, or they were the price paid for acts of\r\npartiality, or, finally, they were sums of money extorted from the\r\ngivers by the terrors of power. Against the system of presents,\r\ntherefore, the new commission was in general opinion particularly\r\npointed. In the commencement of reformation, at a period when a\r\nrapacious conquest had overpowered and succeeded to a corrupt\r\ngovernment, an act of indemnity might have been thought advisable;\r\nperhaps a new account ought to have been opened; all retrospect ought to\r\nhave been forbidden, at least to certain periods. If this had not been\r\nthought advisable, none in the higher departments of a suspected and\r\ndecried government ought to have been kept in their posts, until an\r\nexamination had rendered their proceedings clear, or until length of\r\ntime had obliterated, by an even course of irreproachable conduct, the\r\nerrors which so naturally grow out of a new power. But the policy\r\nadopted was different: it was to begin with _examples_. The cry against\r\nthe abuses was strong and vehement throughout the whole nation, and the\r\npractice of presents was represented to be as general as it was\r\nmischievous. In such a case, indeed in any case, it seemed not to be a\r\nmeasure the most provident, without a great deal of previous inquiry, to\r\nplace two persons, who from their situation must be the most exposed to\r\nsuch imputations, in the commission which was to inquire into their own\r\nconduct,--much less to place one of them at the head of that commission,\r\nand with a casting vote in case of an equality. The persons who could\r\nnot be liable to that charge were, indeed, three to two; but any\r\naccidental difference of opinion, the death of any one of them or his\r\noccasional absence or sickness, threw the whole power into the hands of\r\nthe other two, who were Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell, one the President,\r\nand the other high in the Council of that establishment on which the\r\nreform was to operate. Thus those who were liable to process as\r\ndelinquents were in effect set over the reformers; and that did actually\r\nhappen which might be expected to happen from so preposterous an\r\narrangement: a stop was soon put to all inquiries into the capital\r\nabuses.\r\n\r\nNor was the great political end proposed in the formation of a\r\nsuperintending Council over all the Presidencies better answered than\r\nthat of an inquiry into corruptions and abuses. The several Presidencies\r\nhave acted in a great degree upon their own separate authority; and as\r\nlittle of unity, concert, or regular system has appeared in their\r\nconduct as was ever known before this institution. India is, indeed, so\r\nvast a country, and the settlements are so divided, that their\r\nintercourse with each other is liable to as many delays and difficulties\r\nas the intercourse between distant and separate states. But one evil may\r\npossibly have arisen from an attempt to produce an union, which, though\r\nundoubtedly to be aimed at, is opposed in some degree by the unalterable\r\nnature of their situation,--that it has taught the servants rather to\r\nlook to a superior among themselves than to their common superiors. This\r\nevil, growing out of the abuse of the principle of subordination, can\r\nonly be corrected by a very strict enforcement of authority over that\r\npart of the chain of dependence which is next to the original power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers given to the ministers of the crown.]\r\n\r\nThat which your Committee considers as the fifth and last of the capital\r\nobjects of the act, and as the binding regulation of the whole, is the\r\nintroduction (then for the first time) of the ministers of the crown\r\ninto the affairs of the Company. The state claiming a concern and share\r\nof property in the Company's profits, the servants of the crown were\r\npresumed the more likely to preserve with a scrupulous attention the\r\nsources of the great revenues which they were to administer, and for the\r\nrise and fall of which they were to render an account.\r\n\r\nThe interference of government was introduced by this act in two ways:\r\none by a control, in effect by a share, in the appointment to vacancies\r\nin the Supreme Council. The act provided that his Majesty's approbation\r\nshould be had to the persons named to that duty. Partaking thus in the\r\npatronage of the Company, administration was bound to an attention to\r\nthe characters and capacities of the persons employed in that high\r\ntrust. The other part of their interference was by way of inspection. By\r\nthis right of inspection, everything in the Company's correspondence\r\nfrom India, which related to the civil or military affairs and\r\ngovernment of the Company, was directed by the act to be within fourteen\r\ndays after the receipt laid before the Secretary of State, and\r\neverything that related to the management of the revenues was to be laid\r\nbefore the Commissioners of the Treasury. In fact, both description of\r\nthese papers have been generally communicated to that board.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defects in the plan.]\r\n\r\nIt appears to your Committee that there were great and material defects\r\nin both parts of the plan. With regard to the approbation of persons\r\nnominated to the Supreme Council by the Court of Directors, no\r\nsufficient means were provided for carrying to his Majesty, along with\r\nthe nomination, the particulars in the conduct of those who had been in\r\nthe service before, which might render them proper objects of\r\napprobation or rejection. The India House possesses an office of record\r\ncapable of furnishing, in almost all cases, materials for judging on the\r\nbehavior of the servants in their progress from the lowest to the\r\nhighest stations; and the whole discipline of the service, civil and\r\nmilitary, must depend upon an examination of these records inseparably\r\nattending every application for an appointment to the highest stations.\r\nBut in the present state of the nomination the ministers of the crown\r\nare not furnished with the proper means of exercising the power of\r\ncontrol intended by the law, even if they were scrupulously attentive to\r\nthe use of it. There are modes of proceeding favorable to neglect.\r\nOthers excite inquiry and stimulate to vigilance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proposition to remedy them.]\r\n\r\nYour Committee, therefore, are of opinion, that for the future\r\nprevention of cabal, and of private and partial representation, whether\r\nabove or below, that, whenever any person who has been in the service\r\nshall be recommended to the King's ministers to fill a vacancy in the\r\nCouncil-General, the Secretary of the Court of Directors shall be\r\nordered to make a strict search into the records of the Company, and\r\nshall annex to the recommendation the reasons of the Court of Directors\r\nfor their choice, together with a faithful copy of whatever shall be\r\nfound (if anything can be found) relative to his character and\r\nconduct,--as also an account of his standing in the Company's service,\r\nthe time of his abode in India, the reasons for his return, and the\r\nstations, whether civil or military, in which he has been successively\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nWith this account ought to be transmitted the names of those who were\r\nproposed as candidates for the same office, with the correspondent\r\nparticulars relative to their conduct and situation: for not only the\r\nseparate, but the comparative merit, probably would, and certainly\r\nought, to have great influence in the approbation or rejection of the\r\nparty presented to the ministers of the crown. These papers should be\r\nlaid before the Commissioners of the Treasury and one of the Secretaries\r\nof State, and entered in books to be kept in the Treasury and the\r\nSecretary's office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appointment of Counsellors, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Macpherson's appointment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stables's.]\r\n\r\nThese precautions, in case of the nomination of any who have served the\r\nCompany, appear to be necessary from the improper nomination and\r\napprobation of Mr. John Macpherson, notwithstanding the objections\r\nwhich stood against him on the Company's records. The choice of Mr. John\r\nStables, from an inferior military to the highest civil capacity, was by\r\nno means proper, nor an encouraging example to either service. His\r\nconduct, indeed, in the subaltern military situation, had received, and\r\nseems to have deserved, commendation; but no sufficient ground was\r\nfurnished for confounding the lines and gradations of service. This\r\nmeasure was, however, far less exceptionable than the former; because an\r\nirregular choice of a less competent person, and the preference given to\r\nproved delinquency in prejudice to uncensured service, are very\r\ndifferent things. But even this latter appointment would in all\r\nlikelihood have been avoided, if rules of promotion had been\r\nestablished. If such rules were settled, candidates qualified from\r\nability, knowledge, and service would not be discouraged by finding that\r\neverything was open to every man, and that favor alone stood in the\r\nplace of civil or military experience. The elevation from the lowest\r\nstations unfaithfully and negligently filled to the highest trusts, the\r\ntotal inattention to rank and seniority, and, much more, the combination\r\nof this neglect of rank with a confusion (unaccompanied with strong and\r\nevident reasons) of the lines of service, cannot operate as useful\r\nexamples on those who serve the public in India. These servants,\r\nbeholding men who have been condemned for improper behavior to the\r\nCompany in inferior civil stations elevated above them, or (what is less\r\nblamable, but still mischievous) persons without any distinguished civil\r\ntalents taken from the subordinate situations of another line to their\r\nprejudice, will despair by any good behavior of ascending to the\r\ndignities of their own: they will be led to improve, to the utmost\r\nadvantage of their fortune, the lower stages of power, and will endeavor\r\nto make up in lucre what they can never hope to acquire in station.\r\n\r\nThe temporary appointment by Parliament of the Supreme Council of India\r\narose from an opinion that the Company, at that time at least, was not\r\nin a condition or not disposed to a proper exercise of the privileges\r\nwhich they held under their charter. It therefore behoved the Directors\r\nto be particularly attentive to their choice of Counsellors, on the\r\nexpiration of the period during which their patronage had been\r\nsuspended. The duties of the Supreme Council had been reputed of so\r\narduous a nature as to require even a legislative interposition. They\r\nwere called upon, by all possible care and impartiality, to justify\r\nParliament at least as fully in the restoration of their privileges as\r\nthe circumstances of the time had done in their suspension.\r\n\r\nBut interests have lately prevailed in the Court of Directors, which, by\r\nthe violation of every rule, seemed to be resolved on the destruction of\r\nthose privileges of which they were the natural guardians. Every new\r\npower given has been made the source of a new abuse; and the acts of\r\nParliament themselves, which provide but imperfectly for the prevention\r\nof the mischief, have, it is to be feared, made provisions (contrary,\r\nwithout doubt, to the intention of the legislature) which operate\r\nagainst the possibility of any cure in the ordinary course.\r\n\r\nIn the original institution of the Supreme Council, reasons may have\r\nexisted against rendering the tenure of the Counsellors in their office\r\nprecarious. A plan of reform might have required the permanence of the\r\npersons who were just appointed by Parliament to execute it. But the act\r\nof 1780 gave a duration coexistent with the statute itself to a Council\r\nnot appointed by act of Parliament, nor chosen for any temporary or\r\nspecial purpose; by which means the servants in the highest situation,\r\nlet their conduct be never so grossly criminal, cannot be removed,\r\nunless the Court of Directors and ministers of the crown can be found to\r\nconcur in the same opinion of it. The prevalence of the Indian factions\r\nin the Court of Directors and Court of Proprietors, and sometimes in the\r\nstate itself, renders this agreement extremely difficult: if the\r\nprincipal members of the Direction should be in a conspiracy with any\r\nprincipal servant under censure, it will be impracticable; because the\r\nfirst act must originate there. The reduced state of the authority of\r\nthis kingdom in Bengal may be traced in a great measure to that very\r\nnatural source of independence. In many cases the instant removal of an\r\noffender from his power of doing mischief is the only mode of preventing\r\nthe utter and perhaps irretrievable ruin of public affairs. In such a\r\ncase the process ought to be simple, and the power absolute in one or in\r\neither hand separately. By contriving the balance of interests formed in\r\nthe act, notorious offence, gross error, or palpable insufficiency have\r\nmany chances of retaining and abusing authority, whilst the variety of\r\nrepresentations, hearings, and conferences, and possibly the mere\r\njealousy and competition between rival powers, may prevent any decision,\r\nand at length give time and means for settlements and compromises among\r\nparties, made at the expense of justice and true policy. But this act of\r\n1780, not properly distinguishing judicial process from executive\r\narrangements, requires in effect nearly the same degree of solemnity,\r\ndelay, and detail for removing a political inconvenience which attends a\r\ncriminal proceeding for the punishment of offences. It goes further, and\r\ngives the same tenure to all who shall succeed to vacancies which was\r\ngiven to those whom the act found in office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Provisional appointment for vacancies.]\r\n\r\nAnother regulation was made in the act, which has a tendency to render\r\nthe control of delinquency or the removal of incapacity in the\r\nCouncil-General extremely difficult, as well as to introduce many other\r\nabuses into the original appointment of Counsellors. The inconveniences\r\nof a vacancy in that important office, at a great distance from the\r\nauthority that is to fill it, were visible; but your Committee have\r\ndoubts whether they balance the mischief which may arise from the power\r\ngiven in this act, of a provisional appointment to vacancies, not on the\r\nevent, but on foresight. This mode of providing for the succession has a\r\ntendency to promote cabal, and to prevent inquiry into the\r\nqualifications of the persons to be appointed. An attempt has been\r\nactually made, in consequence of this power, in a very marked manner, to\r\nconfound the whole order and discipline of the Company's service. Means\r\nare furnished thereby for perpetuating the powers of some given Court of\r\nDirectors. They may forestall the patronage of their successors, on whom\r\nthey entail a line of Supreme Counsellors and Governors-General. And if\r\nthe exercise of this power should happen in its outset to fall into bad\r\nhands, the ordinary chances for mending an ill choice upon death or\r\nresignation are cut off.\r\n\r\nIn these provisional arrangements it is to be considered that the\r\nappointment is not in consequence of any marked event which calls\r\nstrongly on the attention of the public, but is made at the discretion\r\nof those who lead in the Court of Directors, and may therefore be\r\nbrought forward at times the most favorable to the views of partiality\r\nand corruption. Candidates have not, therefore, the notice that may be\r\nnecessary for their claims; and as the possession of the office to which\r\nthe survivors are to succeed seems remote, all inquiry into the\r\nqualifications and character of those who are to fill it will naturally\r\nbe dull and languid.\r\n\r\nYour Committee are not also without a grounded apprehension of the ill\r\neffect on any existing Council-General of all strong marks of influence\r\nand favor which appear in the subordinates of Bengal. This previous\r\ndesignation to a great and arduous trust, (the greatest that can be\r\nreposed in subjects,) when made out of any regular course of succession,\r\nmarks that degree of countenance and support at home which may\r\novershadow the existing government. That government may thereby be\r\ndisturbed by factions, and led to corrupt and dangerous compliances. At\r\nbest, when these Counsellors elect are engaged in no fixed employment,\r\nand have no lawful intermediate emolument, the natural impatience for\r\ntheir situations may bring on a traffic for resignations between them\r\nand the persons in possession, very unfavorable to the interests of the\r\npublic and to the duty of their situations.\r\n\r\nSince the act two persons have been nominated to the ministers of the\r\ncrown by the Court of Directors for this succession. Neither has yet\r\nbeen approved. But by the description of the persons a judgment may be\r\nformed of the principles on which this power is likely to be exercised.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stuart and Sulivan's appointment to succeed to vacancies.]\r\n\r\nYour Committee find, that, in consequence of the above-mentioned act,\r\nthe Honorable Charles Stuart and Mr. Sulivan were appointed to succeed\r\nto the first vacancies in the Supreme Council. Mr. Stuart's first\r\nappointment in the Company's service was in the year 1761. He returned\r\nto England in 1775, and was permitted to go back to India in 1780. In\r\nAugust, 1781, he was nominated by the Court of Directors (Mr. Sulivan\r\nand Sir William James were Chairman and Deputy-Chairman) to succeed to\r\nthe first vacancy in the Supreme Council, and on the 19th of September\r\nfollowing his Majesty's approval of such nomination was requested.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Stuart's situation at the time of his appointment.]\r\n\r\nIn the nomination of Mr. Stuart, the consideration of rank in the\r\nservice was not neglected; but if the Court of Directors had thought fit\r\nto examine their records, they would have found matter at least strongly\r\nurging them to a suspension of this appointment, until the charges\r\nagainst Mr. Stuart should be fully cleared up. That matter remained (as\r\nit still remains) unexplained from the month of May, 1775, where, on the\r\nBengal Revenue Consultations of the 12th of that month, peculations to a\r\nlarge amount are charged upon oath against Mr. Stuart under the\r\nfollowing title: \"_The Particulars of the Money unjustly taken by Mr.\r\nStuart, during the Time he was at Burdwan._\" The sum charged against him\r\nin this account is 2,17,684 Sicca rupees (that is, 25,253_l._ sterling);\r\nbesides which there is another account with the following title: \"_The\r\nParticulars of the Money unjustly taken by Callypersaud Bose, Banian to\r\nthe Honorable Charles Stuart, Esquire, at Burdwan, and amounting to\r\nSicca Rupees 1,01,675_\" (that is, 11,785_l._),--a large sum to be\r\nreceived by a person in that subordinate situation.\r\n\r\nThe minuteness with which these accounts appear to have been kept, and\r\nthe precision with which the date of each particular, sometimes of very\r\nsmall sums, is stated, give them the appearance of authenticity, as far\r\nas it can be conveyed on the face or in the construction of such\r\naccounts, and, if they were forgeries, laid them open to an easy\r\ndetection. But no detection is easy, when no inquiry is made. It appears\r\nan offence of the highest order in the Directors concerned in this\r\nbusiness, when, not satisfied with leaving such charges so long\r\nunexamined, they should venture to present to the king's servants the\r\nobject of them for the highest trust which they have to bestow. If Mr.\r\nStuart was really guilty, the possession of this post must furnish him\r\nnot only with the means of renewing the former evil practices charged\r\nupon him, and of executing them upon a still larger scale, but of\r\noppressing those unhappy persons who, under the supposed protection of\r\nthe faith of the Company, had appeared to give evidence concerning his\r\nformer misdemeanors.\r\n\r\nThis attempt in the Directors was the more surprising, when it is\r\nconsidered that two committees of this House were at that very time\r\nsitting upon an inquiry that related directly to their conduct, and that\r\nof their servants in India.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Sulivan's situation at the time of his appointment.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the same spirit of defiance of Parliament, that at the same\r\ntime they nominated Mr. Sulivan, son to the then Chairman of the Court\r\nof Directors, to the succession to the same high trust in India. On\r\nthese appointments, your Committee thought it proper to make those\r\ninquiries which the Court of Directors thought proper to omit. They\r\nfirst conceived it fitting to inquire what rank Mr. Sulivan bore in the\r\nservice; and they thought it not unnecessary here to state the\r\ngradations in the service, according to the established usage of the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThe Company's civil servants generally go to India as _writers_, in\r\nwhich capacity they serve the Company _five years_. The next step, in\r\npoint of rank, is to be a _factor_, and next to that a _junior\r\nmerchant_; in each of which capacities they serve the Company _three\r\nyears_. They then rise to the rank of _senior merchant_, in which\r\nsituation they remain till called by rotation to the _Board of Trade_.\r\nUntil the passing of the Regulation Act, in 1773, seniority entitled\r\nthem to succeed to the _Council_, and finally gave them pretensions to\r\nthe _government of the Presidency_.\r\n\r\nThe above gradation of the service, your Committee conceive, ought never\r\nto be superseded by the Court of Directors, without evident reason, in\r\npersons or circumstances, to justify the breach of an ancient order. The\r\nnames, whether taken from civil or commercial gradation, are of no\r\nmoment. The order itself is wisely established, and tends to provide a\r\nnatural guard against partiality, precipitancy, and corruption in\r\npatronage. It affords means and opportunities for an examination into\r\ncharacter; and among the servants it secures a strong motive to preserve\r\na fair reputation. Your Committee find that no respect whatsoever was\r\npaid to this gradation in the instance of Mr. Sulivan, nor is there any\r\nreason assigned for departing from it. They do not find that Mr. Sulivan\r\nhad ever served the Company in any one of the above capacities, but was,\r\nin the year 1777, abruptly brought into the service, and sent to Madras\r\nto succeed as Persian Translator and Secretary to the Council.\r\n\r\nYour Committee have found a letter from Mr. Sulivan to George Wombwell\r\nand William Devaynes, Esquires, Chairman and Deputy-Chairman of the\r\nCourt of Directors, stating that he trusted _his applications_ would\r\nhave a place in their deliberations when Madras affairs were taken up.\r\nOf what nature those applications were your Committee cannot discover,\r\nas no traces of them appear on the Company's records,--nor whether any\r\nproofs of his ability, even as Persian Translator, which might entitle\r\nhim to a preference to the many servants in India whose study and\r\nopportunities afforded them the means of becoming perfect masters of\r\nthat language.\r\n\r\nOn the above letter your Committee find that the Committee of\r\nCorrespondence proceeded; and on their recommendation the Court of\r\nDirectors unanimously approved of Mr. Sulivan to be appointed to succeed\r\nto the posts of Secretary and Persian Translator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Sulivan's succession of offices.]\r\n\r\nConformably to the orders of the court, Mr. Sulivan succeeded to those\r\nposts; and the President and Council acquainted the Court of Directors\r\nthat they had been obeyed. About five months after, it appears that Mr.\r\nSulivan thought fit to resign the office of Persian Translator, to which\r\nhe had been appointed by the Directors. In April, 1780, Mr. Sulivan is\r\ncommended for his _great diligence as Secretary_; in August following\r\nhe obtains leave to accompany Mrs. Sulivan to Bengal, whence she is to\r\nproceed to Europe on account of her health; and he is charged with a\r\ncommission from the President and Council of Fort St. George to obtain\r\nfor that settlement supplies of grain, troops, and money, from the\r\nGovernor-General and Council of Bengal. In October the Governor-General\r\nrequests permission of the Council there to employ Mr. Sulivan as his\r\n_Assistant_, for that he had experienced (between his arrival in Bengal\r\nand that time) the abilities of Mr. Sulivan, and made choice of him as\r\n_completely qualified for that trust_; also requests the board to\r\nappoint him Judge-Advocate-General, and likewise to apply to the\r\nPresidency of Madras for him to remain in Bengal without prejudice to\r\nhis rank on their establishment: which several requests the board at\r\nMadras readily complied with, notwithstanding their natural sensibility\r\nto the loss of a Secretary of such ability and diligence as they had\r\ndescribed Mr. Sulivan to be.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of December following, the President and Council received a\r\nletter from Bengal, requesting that Mr. Sulivan might be allowed to keep\r\nhis rank. This request brought on some discussion. A Mr. Freeman, it\r\nseems, who had acted under Mr. Sulivan as Sub-Secretary whilst his\r\nprincipal obtained so much praise for his diligence, addressed the board\r\non the same day, and observed, \"that, since Mr. Sulivan's arrival, _he_\r\n[Mr. Freeman] had, _without intermission_, done almost the _whole_ of\r\nthe duty allotted to the post of Secretary, _which it was notorious Mr.\r\nSulivan had paid but little attention to_; and neither his inclination\r\nor duty led him to act any longer as Mr. Sulivan's deputy.\"\r\n\r\nHere your Committee cannot avoid remarking the direct contradiction\r\nwhich this address of Mr. Freeman's gives to the letter from the\r\nPresident and Council to the Court of Directors in April, 1780, wherein\r\nMr. Sulivan is praised for his \"diligence and attention in his office of\r\nSecretary.\"\r\n\r\nThe President and Council do not show any displeasure at Mr. Freeman's\r\nrepresentation, (so contrary to their own,) the truth of which they thus\r\ntacitly admit, but agree to write to the Governor-General and Council,\r\n\"that it could not be supposed that they could carry on the public\r\nbusiness for any length of time without _the services of a Secretary_\r\nand Clerk of Appeals, two offices that required personal attendance, and\r\nwhich would be a general injury to the servants on their establishment,\r\nand in particular to the person who acted in those capacities, as they\r\nlearnt that Mr. Sulivan had been appointed Judge-Advocate-General in\r\nBengal,--and to request the Governor-General and Council to inform Mr.\r\nSulivan of their sentiments, and to desire him to inform them whether he\r\nmeant to return to his station or to remain in Bengal.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th December, as a mark of their approbation of Mr. Freeman, who\r\nhad so plainly contradicted their opinion of Mr. Sulivan, the President\r\nand Council agree to appoint him to act as Secretary and Clerk of\r\nAppeals, till Mr. Sulivan's answer should arrive, with the emoluments,\r\nand to confirm him therein, if Mr. Sulivan should remain in Bengal.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th February, 1781, the President and Council received a letter\r\nfrom Bengal in reply, and stating their request that Mr. Sulivan might\r\nreserve the right of returning to his original situation on the Madras\r\nestablishment, if the Court of Directors should disapprove of his being\r\ntransferred to Bengal. To this request the board at Madras declare they\r\nhave no objection: and here the matter rests; the Court of Directors not\r\nhaving given any tokens of approbation or disapprobation of the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of Mr. Sulivan's service from the time of his\r\nappointment; such were the qualifications, and such the proofs of\r\nassiduity and diligence given by him in holding so many incompatible\r\noffices, (as well as being engaged in other dealings, which will appear\r\nin their place,) when, after three years' desultory residence in India,\r\nhe was thought worthy to be nominated to the succession to the Supreme\r\nCouncil. No proof whatsoever of distinguished capacity in any line\r\npreceded his original appointment to the service: so that the whole of\r\nhis fitness for the Supreme Council rested upon his conduct and\r\ncharacter since his appointment as Persian Translator.\r\n\r\nYour Committee find that his Majesty has not yet given his approbation\r\nto the nomination, made by the Court of Directors on the 30th of August,\r\n1781, of Messrs. Stuart and Sulivan to succeed to the Supreme Council on\r\nthe first vacancies, though the Court applied for the royal approbation\r\nso long ago as the 19th of September, 1781; and in these instances the\r\nking's ministers performed their duty, in withholding their countenance\r\nfrom a proceeding so exceptionable and of so dangerous an example.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, from a full view of the situation and duties of the\r\nCourt of Directors, are of opinion that effectual means ought to be\r\ntaken for regulating that court in such a manner as to prevent either\r\nrivalship with or subserviency to their servants. It might, therefore,\r\nbe proper for the House to consider whether it is fit that those who\r\nare, or have been within some given time, Directors of the Company,\r\nshould be capable of an appointment to any offices in India. Directors\r\ncan never properly govern those for whose employments they are or may be\r\nthemselves candidates; they can neither protect nor coerce them with due\r\nimpartiality or due authority.\r\n\r\nIf such rules as are stated by your Committee under this head were\r\nobserved in the regular service at home and abroad, the necessity of\r\nsuperseding the regular service by strangers would be more rare; and\r\nwhenever the servants were so superseded, those who put forward other\r\ncandidates would be obliged to produce a strong plea of merit and\r\nability, which, in the judgment of mankind, ought to overpower\r\npretensions so authentically established, and so rigorously guarded from\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deficiency of powers to ministers of government.]\r\n\r\nThe second object, in this part of the plan, of the act of 1773, namely,\r\nthat of inspection by the ministers of the crown, appears not to have\r\nbeen provided for, so as to draw the timely and productive attention of\r\nthe state on the grievances of the people of India, and on the abuses of\r\nits government. By the Regulating Act, the ministers were enabled to\r\ninspect one part of the correspondence, that which was received in\r\nEngland, but not that which went outward. They might know something, but\r\nthat very imperfectly and unsystematically, of the state of affairs; but\r\nthey were neither authorized to advance nor to retard any measure taken\r\nby the Directors in consequence of that state: they were not provided\r\neven with sufficient means of knowing what any of these measures were.\r\nAnd this imperfect information, together with the want of a direct call\r\nto any specific duty, might have, in some degree, occasioned that\r\nremissness which rendered even the imperfect powers originally given by\r\nthe act of 1773 the less efficient. This defect was in a great measure\r\nremedied by a subsequent act; but that act was not passed until the year\r\n1780.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disorders increased since 1773.]\r\n\r\nYour Committee find that during the whole period which elapsed from 1773\r\nto the commencement of 1782 disorders and abuses of every kind\r\nmultiplied. Wars contrary to policy and contrary to public faith were\r\ncarrying on in various parts of India. The allies, dependants, and\r\nsubjects of the Company were everywhere oppressed;[2] dissensions in the\r\nSupreme Council prevailed, and continued for the greater part of that\r\ntime; the contests between the civil and judicial powers threatened that\r\nissue to which they came at last, an armed resistance to the authority\r\nof the king's court of justice; the orders which by an act of Parliament\r\nthe servants were bound to obey were avowedly and on principle\r\ncontemned; until at length the fatal effects of accumulated misdemeanors\r\nabroad and neglects at home broke out in the alarming manner which your\r\nCommittee have so fully reported to this House.[3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proceedings in India not known to Parliament.]\r\n\r\nIn all this time the true state of the several Presidencies, and the\r\nreal conduct of the British government towards the natives, was not at\r\nall known to Parliament: it seems to have been very imperfectly known\r\neven to ministers. Indeed, it required an unbroken attention, and much\r\ncomparison of facts and reasonings, to form a true judgment on that\r\ndifficult and complicated system of politics, revenue, and commerce,\r\nwhilst affairs were only in their progress to that state which produced\r\nthe present inquiries. Therefore, whilst the causes of their ruin were\r\nin the height of their operation, both the Company and the natives were\r\nunderstood by the public as in circumstances the most assured and most\r\nflourishing; insomuch that, whenever the affairs of India were brought\r\nbefore Parliament, as they were two or three times during that period,\r\nthe only subject-matter of discussion anywise important was concerning\r\nthe sums which might be taken out of the Company's surplus profits for\r\nthe advantage of the state. Little was thought of but the disengagement\r\nof the Company from their debts in _England_, and to prevent the\r\nservants abroad from drawing upon them, so as that body might be\r\nenabled, without exciting clamors here, to afford the contribution that\r\nwas demanded. All descriptions of persons, either here or in India,\r\nlooking solely to appearances at home, the reputation of the Directors\r\ndepended on the keeping the Company's sales in a situation to support\r\nthe dividend, that of the ministers depended on the most lucrative\r\nbargains for the Exchequer, and that of the servants abroad on the\r\nlargest investments; until at length there is great reason to apprehend,\r\nthat, unless some very substantial reform takes place in the management\r\nof the Company's affairs, nothing will be left for investment, for\r\ndividend, or for bargain, and India, instead of a resource to the\r\npublic, may itself come, in no great length of time, to be reckoned\r\namongst the public burdens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inspection of ministers has failed in effect.]\r\n\r\nIn this manner the inspection of the ministers of the crown, the great\r\ncementing regulation of the whole act of 1773, has, along with all the\r\nothers, entirely failed in its effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure in the act.]\r\n\r\nYour Committee, in observing on the failure of this act, do not consider\r\nthe intrinsic defects or mistakes in the law itself as the sole cause of\r\nits miscarriage. The general policy of the nation with regard to this\r\nobject has been, they conceive, erroneous; and no remedy by laws, under\r\nthe prevalence of that policy, can be effectual. Before any remedial law\r\ncan have its just operation, the affairs of India must be restored to\r\ntheir natural order. The prosperity of the natives must be previously\r\nsecured, before any profit from them whatsoever is attempted. For as\r\nlong as a system prevails which regards the transmission of great wealth\r\nto this country, either for the Company or the state, as its principal\r\nend, so long will it be impossible that those who are the instruments of\r\nthat scheme should not be actuated by the same spirit for their own\r\nprivate purposes. It will be worse: they will support the injuries done\r\nto the natives for their selfish ends by new injuries done in favor of\r\nthose before whom they are to account. It is not reasonably to be\r\nexpected that a public rapacious and improvident should be served by any\r\nof its subordinates with disinterestedness or foresight.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--CONNECTION OF GREAT BRITAIN WITH INDIA.\r\n\r\nIn order to open more fully the tendency of the policy which has\r\nhitherto prevailed, and that the House may be enabled, in any\r\nregulations which may be made, to follow the tracks of the abuse, and\r\nto apply an appropriated remedy to a particular distemper, your\r\nCommittee think it expedient to consider in some detail the manner in\r\nwhich India is connected with this kingdom,--which is the second head of\r\ntheir plan.\r\n\r\nThe two great links by which this connection is maintained are, first,\r\nthe East India Company's commerce, and, next, the government set over\r\nthe natives by that company and by the crown. The first of these\r\nprinciples of connection, namely, the East India Company's trade, is to\r\nbe first considered, not only as it operates by itself, but as having a\r\npowerful influence over the general policy and the particular measures\r\nof the Company's government. Your Committee apprehend that the present\r\nstate, nature, and tendency of this trade are not generally understood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trade to India formerly carried on chiefly in silver.]\r\n\r\nUntil the acquisition of great territorial revenues by the East India\r\nCompany, the trade with India was carried on upon the common principles\r\nof commerce,--namely, by sending out such commodities as found a demand\r\nin the India market, and, where that demand was not adequate to the\r\nreciprocal call of the European market for Indian goods, by a large\r\nannual exportation of treasure, chiefly in silver. In some years that\r\nexport has been as high as six hundred and eighty thousand pounds\r\nsterling. The other European companies trading to India traded thither\r\non the same footing. Their export of bullion was probably larger in\r\nproportion to the total of their commerce, as their commerce itself bore\r\na much larger proportion to the British than it does at this time or has\r\ndone for many years past. But stating it to be equal to the British,\r\nthe whole of the silver sent annually from Europe into Hindostan could\r\nnot fall very short of twelve or thirteen hundred thousand pounds a\r\nyear. This influx of money, poured into India by an emulation of all the\r\ncommercial nations of Europe, encouraged industry and promoted\r\ncultivation in a high degree, notwithstanding the frequent wars with\r\nwhich that country was harassed, and the vices which existed in its\r\ninternal government. On the other hand, the export of so much silver was\r\nsometimes a subject of grudging and uneasiness in Europe, and a commerce\r\ncarried on through such a medium to many appeared in speculation of\r\ndoubtful advantage. But the practical demands of commerce bore down\r\nthose speculative objections. The East India commodities were so\r\nessential for animating all other branches of trade, and for completing\r\nthe commercial circle, that all nations contended for it with the\r\ngreatest avidity. The English company flourished under this exportation\r\nfor a very long series of years. The nation was considerably benefited\r\nboth in trade and in revenue; and the dividends of the proprietors were\r\noften high, and always sufficient to keep up the credit of the Company's\r\nstock in heart and vigor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How trade carried on since.]\r\n\r\nBut at or very soon after the acquisition of the territorial revenues to\r\nthe English company, the period of which may be reckoned as completed\r\nabout the year 1765, a very great revolution took place in commerce as\r\nwell as in dominion; and it was a revolution which affected the trade of\r\nHindostan with all other European nations, as well as with that in whose\r\nfavor and by whose power it was accomplished. From that time bullion was\r\nno longer regularly exported by the English East India Company to\r\nBengal, or any part of Hindostan; and it was soon exported in much\r\nsmaller quantities by any other nation. A new way of supplying the\r\nmarket of Europe, by means of the British power and influence, was\r\ninvented: a species of trade (if such it may be called) by which it is\r\nabsolutely impossible that India should not be radically and\r\nirretrievably ruined, although our possessions there were to be ordered\r\nand governed upon principles diametrically opposite to those which now\r\nprevail in the system and practice of the British company's\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Investments.]\r\n\r\nA certain portion of the revenues of Bengal has been for many years set\r\napart to be employed in the purchase of goods for exportation to\r\nEngland, and this is called the _Investment_. The greatness of this\r\ninvestment has been the standard by which the merit of the Company's\r\nprincipal servants has been too generally estimated; and this main cause\r\nof the impoverishment of India has been generally taken as a measure of\r\nits wealth and prosperity. Numerous fleets of large ships, loaded with\r\nthe most valuable commodities of the East, annually arriving in England,\r\nin a constant and increasing succession, imposed upon the public eye,\r\nand naturally gave rise to an opinion of the happy condition and growing\r\nopulence of a country whose surplus productions occupied so vast a space\r\nin the commercial world. This export from India seemed to imply also a\r\nreciprocal supply, by which the trading capital employed in those\r\nproductions was continually strengthened and enlarged. But the payment\r\nof a tribute, and not a beneficial commerce to that country, wore this\r\nspecious and delusive appearance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Increase of expenses.]\r\n\r\nThe fame of a great territorial revenue, exaggerated, as is usual in\r\nsuch cases, beyond even its value, and the abundant fortunes of the\r\nCompany's officers, military and civil, which flowed into Europe with a\r\nfull tide, raised in the proprietors of East India stock a premature\r\ndesire of partaking with their servants in the fruits of that splendid\r\nadventure. Government also thought they could not be too early in their\r\nclaims for a share of what they considered themselves as entitled to in\r\nevery foreign acquisition made by the power of this kingdom, through\r\nwhatever hands or by whatever means it was made. These two parties,\r\nafter some struggle, came to an agreement to divide between them the\r\nprofits which their speculation proposed to realize in England from the\r\nterritorial revenue in Bengal. About two hundred thousand pounds was\r\nadded to the annual dividends of the proprietors. Four hundred thousand\r\nwas given to the state, which, added to the old dividend, brought a\r\nconstant charge upon the mixed interest of Indian trade and revenue of\r\neight hundred thousand pounds a year. This was to be provided for at all\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nBy that vast demand on the territorial fund, the correctives and\r\nqualifications which might have been gradually applied to the abuses in\r\nIndian commerce and government were rendered extremely difficult.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Progress of investments.]\r\n\r\nThe practice of an investment from the revenue began in the year 1766,\r\nbefore arrangements were made for securing and appropriating an assured\r\nfund for that purpose in the treasury, and for diffusing it from thence\r\nupon the manufactures of the country in a just proportion and in the\r\nproper season. There was, indeed, for a short time, a surplus of cash in\r\nthe treasury. It was in some shape to be sent home to its owners. To\r\nsend it out in silver was subject to two manifest inconveniences. First,\r\nthe country would be exhausted of its circulating medium. A scarcity of\r\ncoin was already felt in Bengal. Cossim Ali Khân, (the Nabob whom the\r\nCompany's servants had lately set up, and newly expelled,) during the\r\nshort period of his power, had exhausted the country by every mode of\r\nextortion; in his flight he carried off an immense treasure, which has\r\nbeen variously computed, but by none at less than three millions\r\nsterling. A country so exhausted of its coin, and harassed by three\r\nrevolutions rapidly succeeding each other, was rather an object that\r\nstood in need of every kind of refreshment and recruit than one which\r\ncould subsist under new evacuations. The next, and equally obvious\r\ninconvenience, was to the Company itself. To send silver into Europe\r\nwould be to send it from the best to the worst market. When arrived, the\r\nmost profitable use which could be made of it would be to send it back\r\nto Bengal for the purchase of Indian merchandise. It was necessary,\r\ntherefore, to turn the Company's revenue into its commerce. The first\r\ninvestment was about five hundred thousand pounds, and care was taken\r\nafterwards to enlarge it. In the years 1767 and 1768 it arose to seven\r\nhundred thousand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consequences of them.]\r\n\r\nThis new system of trade, carried on through the medium of power and\r\npublic revenue, very soon produced its natural effects. The loudest\r\ncomplaints arose among the natives, and among all the foreigners who\r\ntraded to Bengal. It must unquestionably have thrown the whole\r\nmercantile system of the country into the greatest confusion. With\r\nregard to the natives, no expedient was proposed for their relief. The\r\ncase was serious with respect to European powers. The Presidency plainly\r\nrepresented to the Directors, that some agreement should be made with\r\nforeign nations for providing their investment to a certain amount, or\r\nthat the deficiencies then subsisting must terminate in an open rupture\r\nwith France. The Directors, pressed by the large payments in England,\r\nwere not free to abandon their system; and all possible means of\r\ndiverting the manufactures into the Company's investment were still\r\nanxiously sought and pursued, until the difficulties of the foreign\r\ncompanies were at length removed by the natural flow of the fortunes of\r\nthe Company's servants into Europe, in the manner which will be stated\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nBut, with all these endeavors of the Presidency, the investment sunk in\r\n1769, and they were even obliged to pay for a part of the goods to\r\nprivate merchants in the Company's bonds, bearing interest. It was plain\r\nthat this course of business could not hold. The manufacturers of\r\nBengal, far from being generally in a condition to give credit, have\r\nalways required advances to be made to them; so have the merchants very\r\ngenerally,--at least, since the prevalence of the English power in\r\nIndia. It was necessary, therefore, and so the Presidency of Calcutta\r\nrepresented the matter, to provide beforehand a year's advance. This\r\nrequired great efforts; and they were made. Notwithstanding the famine\r\nin 1770, which wasted Bengal in a manner dreadful beyond all example,\r\nthe investment, by a variety of successive expedients, many of them of\r\nthe most dangerous nature and tendency, was forcibly kept up; and even\r\nin that forced and unnatural state it gathered strength almost every\r\nyear. The debts contracted in the infancy of the system were gradually\r\nreduced, and the advances to contractors and manufacturers were\r\nregularly made; so that the goods from Bengal, purchased from the\r\nterritorial revenues, from the sale of European goods, and from the\r\nproduce of the monopolies, for the four years which ended with 1780,\r\nwhen the investment from the surplus revenues finally closed, were never\r\nless than a million sterling, and commonly nearer twelve hundred\r\nthousand pounds. This million is the lowest value of the goods sent to\r\nEurope for which no satisfaction is made.[4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remittances from Bengal to China and the Presidencies.]\r\n\r\nAbout an hundred thousand pounds a year is also remitted from Bengal, on\r\nthe Company's account, to China; and the whole of the product of that\r\nmoney flows into the direct trade from China to Europe. Besides this,\r\nBengal sends a regular supply in time of peace to those Presidencies\r\nwhich are unequal to their own establishment. To Bombay the remittance\r\nin money, bills, or goods, for none of which there is a return, amounts\r\nto one hundred and sixty thousand pounds a year at a medium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exports from England to India.]\r\n\r\nThe goods which are exported from Europe to India consist chiefly of\r\nmilitary and naval stores, of clothing for troops, and of other objects\r\nfor the consumption of the Europeans residing there; and, excepting some\r\nlead, copper utensils and sheet copper, woollen cloth, and other\r\ncommodities of little comparative value, no sort of merchandise is sent\r\nfrom England that is in demand for the wants or desires of the native\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bad effects of investment.]\r\n\r\nWhen an account is taken of the intercourse (for it is not commerce)\r\nwhich is carried on between Bengal and England, the pernicious effects\r\nof the system of investment from revenue will appear in the strongest\r\npoint of view. In that view, the whole exported produce of the country,\r\nso far as the Company is concerned, is not exchanged in the course of\r\nbarter, but is taken away without any return or payment whatsoever. In a\r\ncommercial light, therefore, England becomes annually bankrupt to Bengal\r\nto the amount nearly of its whole dealing; or rather, the country has\r\nsuffered what is tantamount to an annual plunder of its manufactures and\r\nits produce to the value of twelve hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign companies.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consequences of their trade.]\r\n\r\nIn time of peace, three foreign companies appear at first sight to bring\r\ntheir contribution of trade to the supply of this continual drain. These\r\nare the companies of France, Holland, and Denmark. But when the object\r\nis considered more nearly, instead of relief, these companies, who from\r\ntheir want of authority in the country might seem to trade upon a\r\nprinciple merely commercial, will be found to add their full proportion\r\nto the calamity brought upon Bengal by the destructive system of the\r\nruling power; because the greater part of the capital of all these\r\ncompanies, and perhaps the whole capital of some of them, is furnished\r\nexactly as the British is, out of the revenues of the country. The civil\r\nand military servants of the English East India Company being\r\nrestricted in drawing bills upon Europe, and none of them ever making or\r\nproposing an establishment in India, a very great part of their\r\nfortunes, well or ill gotten, is in all probability thrown, as fast as\r\nrequired, into the cash of these companies.\r\n\r\nIn all other countries, the revenue, following the natural course and\r\norder of things, arises out of their commerce. Here, by a mischievous\r\ninversion of that order, the whole foreign maritime trade, whether\r\nEnglish, French, Dutch, or Danish, arises from the revenues; and these\r\nare carried out of the country without producing anything to compensate\r\nso heavy a loss.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign companies' investments.]\r\n\r\nYour Committee have not been able to discover the entire value of the\r\ninvestment made by foreign companies. But, as the investment which the\r\nEnglish East India Company derived from its revenues, and even from its\r\npublic credit, is for the year 1783 to be wholly stopped, it has been\r\nproposed to private persons to make a subscription for an investment on\r\ntheir own account. This investment is to be equal to the sum of\r\n800,000_l._ Another loan has been also made for an investment on the\r\nCompany's account to China of 200,000_l._ This makes a million; and\r\nthere is no question that much more could be readily had for bills upon\r\nEurope. Now, as there is no doubt that the whole of the money remitted\r\nis the property of British subjects, (none else having any interest in\r\nremitting to Europe,) it is not unfair to suppose that a very great\r\npart, if not the whole, of what may find its way into this new channel\r\nis not newly created, but only diverted from those channels in which it\r\nformerly ran, that is, the cash of the foreign trading companies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the silver sent to China.]\r\n\r\nBesides the investment made in goods by foreign companies from the funds\r\nof British subjects, these subjects have been for some time in the\r\npractice of sending very great sums in gold and silver directly to China\r\non their own account. In a memorial presented to the Governor-General\r\nand Council, in March, 1782, it appears that the principal money lent by\r\nBritish subjects to one company of merchants in China then amounted to\r\nseven millions of dollars, about one million seven hundred thousand\r\npounds sterling; and not the smallest particle of silver sent to China\r\never returns to India. It is not easy to determine in what proportions\r\nthis enormous sum of money has been sent from Madras or from Bengal; but\r\nit equally exhausts a country belonging to this kingdom, whether it\r\ncomes from the one or from the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revenue above the investment, how applied.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Allowance to Nabob of Bengal.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How reduced.]\r\n\r\nBut that the greatness of all these drains, and their effects, may be\r\nrendered more visible, your Committee have turned their consideration to\r\nthe employment of those parts of the Bengal revenue which are not\r\nemployed in the Company's own investments for China and for Europe. What\r\nis taken over and above the investment (when any investment can be made)\r\nfrom the gross revenue, either for the charge of collection or for civil\r\nand military establishments, is in time of peace two millions at the\r\nleast. From the portion of that sum which goes to the support of civil\r\ngovernment the natives are almost wholly excluded, as they are from the\r\nprincipal collections of revenue. With very few exceptions, they are\r\nonly employed as servants and agents to Europeans, or in the inferior\r\ndepartments of collection, when it is absolutely impossible to proceed\r\na step without their assistance. For some time after the acquisition of\r\nthe territorial revenue, the sum of 420,000_l._ a year was paid,\r\naccording to the stipulation of a treaty, to the Nabob of Bengal, for\r\nthe support of his government. This sum, however inconsiderable,\r\ncompared to the revenues of the province, yet, distributed through the\r\nvarious departments of civil administration, served in some degree to\r\npreserve the natives of the better sort, particularly those of the\r\nMahomedan profession, from being utterly ruined. The people of that\r\npersuasion, not being so generally engaged in trade, and not having on\r\ntheir conquest of Bengal divested the ancient Gentoo proprietors of\r\ntheir lands of inheritance, had for their chief, if not their sole\r\nsupport, the share of a moderate conqueror in all offices, civil and\r\nmilitary. But your Committee find that this arrangement was of a short\r\nduration. Without the least regard to the subsistence of this innocent\r\npeople, or to the faith of the agreement on which they were brought\r\nunder the British government, this sum was reduced by a new treaty to\r\n320,000_l._, and soon after, (upon a pretence of the present Nabob's\r\nminority, and a temporary sequestration for the discharge of his debts,)\r\nto 160,000_l._: but when he arrived at his majority, and when the debts\r\nwere paid, (if ever they were paid,) the sequestration still continued;\r\nand so far as the late advices may be understood, the allowance to the\r\nNabob appears still to stand at the reduced sum of 160,000_l._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Native officers.]\r\n\r\nThe other resource of the Mahomedans, and of the Gentoos of certain of\r\nthe higher castes, was the army. In this army, nine tenths of which\r\nconsists of natives, no native, of whatever description, holds any rank\r\nhigher than that of a _Subahdar Commandant_, that is, of an officer\r\nbelow the rank of an English subaltern, who is appointed to each company\r\nof the native soldiery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: All lucrative employments in the hands of the English.]\r\n\r\nYour Committee here would be understood to state the ordinary\r\nestablishment: for the war may have made some alteration. All the\r\nhonorable, all the lucrative situations of the army, all the supplies\r\nand contracts of whatever species that belong to it, are solely in the\r\nhands of the English; so that whatever is beyond the mere subsistence of\r\na common soldier and some officers of a lower rank, together with the\r\nimmediate expenses of the English officers at their table, is sooner or\r\nlater, in one shape or another, sent out of the country.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of Bengal even in time of profound peace, and before\r\nthe whole weight of the public charge fell upon that unhappy country for\r\nthe support of other parts of India, which have been desolated in such a\r\nmanner as to contribute little or nothing to their own protection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Former state of trade.]\r\n\r\nYour Committee have given this short comparative account of the effects\r\nof the maritime traffic of Bengal, when in its natural state, and as it\r\nhas stood since the prevalence of the system of an investment from the\r\nrevenues. But before the formation of that system Bengal did by no means\r\ndepend for its resources on its maritime commerce. The inland trade,\r\nfrom whence it derived a very great supply of silver and gold and many\r\nkinds of merchantable goods, was very considerable. The higher provinces\r\nof the Mogul Empire were then populous and opulent, and intercourse to\r\nan immense amount was carried on between them and Bengal. A great trade\r\nalso passed through these provinces from all the countries on the\r\nfrontier of Persia, and the frontier provinces of Tartary, as well as\r\nfrom Surat and Baroach on the western side of India. These parts opened\r\nto Bengal a communication with the Persian Gulf and with the Red Sea,\r\nand through them with the whole Turkish and the maritime parts of the\r\nPersian Empire, besides the commercial intercourse which it maintained\r\nwith those and many other countries through its own seaports.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And the trade to Turkey.]\r\n\r\nDuring that period the remittances to the Mogul's treasury from Bengal\r\nwere never very large, at least for any considerable time, nor very\r\nregularly sent; and the impositions of the state were soon repaid with\r\ninterest through the medium of a lucrative commerce. But the disorders\r\nof Persia, since the death of Kouli Khân, have wholly destroyed the\r\ntrade of that country; and the trade to Turkey, by Jidda and Bussorah,\r\nwhich was the greatest and perhaps best branch of the Indian trade, is\r\nvery much diminished. The fall of the throne of the Mogul emperors has\r\ndrawn with it that of the great marts of Agra and Delhi. The utmost\r\nconfusion of the northwestern provinces followed this revolution, which\r\nwas not absolutely complete until it received the last hand from Great\r\nBritain. Still greater calamities have fallen upon the fine provinces of\r\nRohilcund and Oude, and on the countries of Corah and Allahabad. By the\r\noperations of the British arms and influence, they are in many places\r\nturned to mere deserts, or so reduced and decayed as to afford very few\r\nmaterials or means of commerce.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State of trade in the Carnatic.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the actual condition of the trade of Bengal since the\r\nestablishment of the British power there. The commerce of the Carnatic,\r\nas far as the inquiries of your Committee have extended, did not appear\r\nwith a better aspect, even before the invasion of Hyder Ali Khân, and\r\nthe consequent desolation, which for many years to come must exclude it\r\nfrom any considerable part of the trading system.\r\n\r\nIt appears, on the examination of an intelligent person concerned in\r\ntrade, and who resided at Madras for several years, that on his arrival\r\nthere, which was in the year 1767, that city was in a flourishing\r\ncondition, and one of the first marts in India; but when he left it, in\r\n1779, there was little or no trade remaining, and but one ship belonging\r\nto the whole place. The evidence of this gentleman purports, that at his\r\nfirst acquaintance with the Carnatic it was a well-cultivated and\r\npopulous country, and as such consumed many articles of merchandise;\r\nthat at his departure he left it much circumscribed in trade, greatly in\r\nthe decline as to population and culture, and with a correspondent decay\r\nof the territorial revenue.\r\n\r\nYour Committee find that there has also been from Madras an investment\r\non the Company's account, taking one year with another, very nearly on\r\nthe same principles and with the same effects as that from Bengal; and\r\nthey think it is highly probable, that, besides the large sums remitted\r\ndirectly from Madras to China, there has likewise been a great deal on a\r\nprivate account, for that and other countries, invested in the cash of\r\nforeign European powers trading on the coast of Coromandel. But your\r\nCommittee have not extended their inquiries relative to the commerce of\r\nthe countries dependent on Madras so far as they have done with regard\r\nto Bengal. They have reason to apprehend that the condition is rather\r\nworse; but if the House requires a more minute examination of this\r\nimportant subject, your Committee is willing to enter into it without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--EFFECT OF THE REVENUE INVESTMENT ON THE COMPANY.\r\n\r\nHitherto your Committee has considered this system of revenue\r\ninvestment, substituted in the place of a commercial link between India\r\nand Europe, so far as it affects India only: they are now to consider it\r\nas it affects the Company. So long as that corporation continued to\r\nreceive a vast quantity of merchantable goods without any disbursement\r\nfor the purchase, so long it possessed wherewithal to continue a\r\ndividend to pay debts, and to contribute to the state. But it must have\r\nbeen always evident to considerate persons, that this vast extraction of\r\nwealth from a country lessening in its resources in proportion to the\r\nincrease of its burdens was not calculated for a very long duration. For\r\na while the Company's servants kept up this investment, not by improving\r\ncommerce, manufacture, or agriculture, but by forcibly raising the\r\nland-rents, on the principles and in the manner hereafter to be\r\ndescribed. When these extortions disappointed or threatened to\r\ndisappoint expectation, in order to purvey for the avarice which raged\r\nin England, they sought for expedients in breaches of all the agreements\r\nby which they were bound by any payment to the country powers, and in\r\nexciting disturbances among all the neighboring princes. Stimulating\r\ntheir ambition, and fomenting their mutual animosities, they sold to\r\nthem reciprocally their common servitude and ruin.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General, Mr. Hastings, and the Council, tell the Directors,\r\n\"that the supply for the investment has arisen from _casual_ and\r\n_extraordinary_ resources, which they could not expect _always_ to\r\ncommand.\" In an earlier minute he expresses himself still more\r\ndistinctly: he says, \"If the internal resources of a state fail it, or\r\nare not equal to its _occasional_ wants, whence can it obtain immediate\r\nrelief but from _external_ means?\" Indeed, the investment has not been\r\nfor any long time the natural product of the revenue of Bengal. When, by\r\nthe vast charge and by the ill return of an evil political and military\r\ntraffic, and by a prodigal increase of establishments, and a profuse\r\nconduct in distributing agencies and contracts, they found themselves\r\nunder difficulties, instead of being cured of their immoral and\r\nimpolitic delusion, they plunged deeper into it, and were drawn from\r\nexpedient to expedient for the supply of the investment into that\r\nendless chain of wars which this House by its resolutions has so justly\r\ncondemned. At home these measures were sometimes countenanced, sometimes\r\nwinked at, sometimes censured, but always with an acceptance of whatever\r\nprofit they afforded.\r\n\r\nAt length, the funds for the investment and for these wars together\r\ncould no longer be supplied. In the year 1778 the provision for the\r\ninvestment from the revenues and from the monopolies stood very high. It\r\nwas estimated at a million four hundred thousand pounds; and of this it\r\nappears that a great deal was realized. But this was the high flood-tide\r\nof the investment; for in that year they announce its probable decline,\r\nand that such extensive supplies could not be continued. The advances to\r\nthe Board of Trade became less punctual, and many disputes arose about\r\nthe time of making them. However, knowing that all their credit at home\r\ndepended on the investment, or upon an opinion of its magnitude, whilst\r\nthey repeat their warning of a probable deficiency, and that their\r\n\"finances bore an unfavorable aspect,\" in the year 1779 they rate their\r\ninvestment still higher. But their payments becoming less and less\r\nregular, and the war carrying away all the supplies, at length Mr.\r\nHastings, in December, 1780, denounced sentence of approaching\r\ndissolution to this system, and tells the Directors that \"he bore too\r\nhigh a respect for their characters to treat them with the management of\r\na preparatory and gradual introduction to an unpleasing report: that it\r\nis the _only substantial_ information he shall have to convey in that\r\nletter.\" In confidence, therefore, of their fortitude, he tells them\r\nwithout ceremony, \"that there will be a necessity of making a large\r\nreduction, or possibly a _total suspension_, of their investment;--that\r\nthey had already been reduced to borrow near 700,000_l._ This resource,\"\r\nsays he, \"cannot last; it must cease at a certain period, and that\r\nperhaps not far _distant_.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not mistaken in his prognostic. Loans now becoming the regular\r\nresource for retrieving the investment, whose ruin was inevitable, the\r\nCouncil enable the Board of Trade, in April, 1781, to grant certificates\r\nfor government bonds at eight per cent interest for about 650,000_l._\r\nThe investment was fixed at 900,000_l._\r\n\r\nBut now another alarming system appeared. These new bonds overloaded\r\nthe market. Those which had been formerly issued were at a discount; the\r\nBoard of Trade was obliged to advance, therefore, a fourth more than\r\nusual to the contractors. This seemed to satisfy that description of\r\ndealers. But as those who bought on agency were limited to no terms of\r\nmutual advantage, and the bonds on the new issue falling from three to\r\neight, nine, and ten per cent discount, the agents were unable to\r\nfurnish at the usual prices. Accordingly a discount was settled on such\r\nterms as could be made: the lowest discount, and that at two places\r\nonly, was at four per cent; which, with the interest on the bonds, made\r\n(besides the earlier advance) at the least twelve per cent additional\r\ncharge upon all goods. It was evident, that, as the investment, instead\r\nof being supported by the revenues, was sunk by the fall of their\r\ncredit, so the net revenues were diminished by the daily accumulation of\r\nan interest accruing on account of the investment. What was done to\r\nalleviate one complaint thus aggravating the other, and at length\r\nproving pernicious to both, this trade on bonds likewise came to its\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nYour Committee has reason to think that the bonds have since that time\r\nsunk to a discount much greater even than what is now stated. The Board\r\nof Trade justly denominates their resource for that year \"the sinking\r\ncredit of a paper currency, laboring, from the uncommon scarcity of\r\nspecie, under disadvantages scarcely surmountable.\" From this they value\r\nthemselves \"on having effected an _ostensible_ provision, at least for\r\nthat investment.\" For 1783 nothing appears even ostensible.\r\n\r\nBy this failure a total revolution ensued, of the most extraordinary\r\nnature, and to which your Committee wish to call the particular\r\nattention of the House. For the Council-General, in their letter of the\r\n8th of April, 1782, after stating that they were disappointed in their\r\nexpectations, (how grounded it does not appear,) \"thought that they\r\nshould be able to spare a sum to the Board of Trade,\"--tell the Court of\r\nDirectors, \"that they had adopted a _new_ method of keeping up the\r\ninvestment, by private subscribers for eighty lacs of rupees, which will\r\nfind _cargoes for their ships_ on the usual terms of privilege, _at the\r\nrisk of the individuals_, and is to be repaid to them _according to the\r\nproduce of the sales in England_,\"--and they tell the Directors, that \"a\r\ncopy of the plan makes a number in their separate dispatches over land.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in reporting this revolution to the House, to avoid\r\nremarking with what fidelity Mr. Hastings and his Council have adhered\r\nto the mode of transmitting their accounts which your Committee found it\r\nnecessary to mark and censure in their First Report. Its pernicious\r\ntendency is there fully set forth. They were peculiarly called on for a\r\nmost accurate state of their affairs, in order to explain the necessity\r\nof having recourse to such a scheme, as well as for a full and correct\r\naccount of the scheme itself. But they send only the above short minute\r\nby one dispatch over land, whilst the copy of the plan itself, on which\r\nthe Directors must form their judgment, is sent separately in another\r\ndispatch over land, which has never arrived. A third dispatch, which\r\nalso contained the plan, was sent by a sea conveyance, and arrived late.\r\nThe Directors have, for very obvious reasons, ordered, by a strict\r\ninjunction, that they should send _duplicates of all_ their dispatches\r\nby _every ship_. The spirit of this rule, perhaps, ought to extend to\r\nevery mode of conveyance. In this case, so far from sending a duplicate,\r\nthey do not send even one perfect account. They announce a plan by one\r\nconveyance, and they send it by another conveyance, with other delays\r\nand other risks.\r\n\r\nAt length, at nearly four months' distance, the plan has been received,\r\nand appears to be substantially that which had been announced, but\r\ndeveloping in the particulars many new circumstances of the greatest\r\nimportance. By this plan it appears that the subscription, even in idea\r\nor pretence, is not for the use of the Company, but that the subscribers\r\nare united into a sort of society for the remitting their _private\r\nfortunes_: the goods, indeed, are said to be _shipped on the Company's\r\naccount_, and they are directed to be sold on the same account, and at\r\nthe usual periods of sales; but, after the payment of duties, and such\r\nother allowances as they choose to make, in the eleventh article they\r\nprovide \"that _the remainder of the sales shall revert to the\r\nsubscribers_, and be declared to be _their property_, and divided in\r\nproportion to _their_ respective shares.\" The compensation which they\r\nallow in this plan to their masters for their brokerage is, that, if,\r\nafter deducting all the charges which they impose, \"the amount of the\r\nsales _should be found_ to exceed two shillings and twopence for the\r\ncurrent rupee of the invoice account, it shall be taken by the Company.\"\r\nFor the management of this concern in Bengal they choose commissioners\r\nby their own authority. By the same authority they form them into a\r\nbody, they put them under rules and regulations, and they empower them\r\nalso to make regulations of their own. They remit, by the like\r\nauthority, the duties to which all private trade is subject; and they\r\ncharge the whole concern with seven per cent, to be paid from the net\r\nproduce of the sales in England, as a recompense to the commissioners:\r\nfor this the commissioners contract to bear all the charges on the goods\r\nto the time of shipping.\r\n\r\nThe servants having formed this plan of trade, and a new commission for\r\nthe conduct of it, on their private account, it is a matter of\r\nconsideration to know who the commissioners are. They turn out to be the\r\nthree senior servants of the Company's Board of Trade, who choose to\r\ntake upon them to be the factors of others for large emoluments, whilst\r\nthey receive salaries of two thousand pounds and fifteen hundred pounds\r\na year from the Company. As the Company have no other fund than the new\r\ninvestment from whence they are to be paid for the care of their\r\nservants' property, this commission and those salaries being to take\r\nplace of their brokerage, they in effect render it very difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, for them to derive advantage from their new occupation.\r\n\r\nAs to the benefit of this _plan_: besides preventing the loss which must\r\nhappen from the Company's ships returning empty to Europe, and the\r\nstopping of all trade between India and England, the authors of it\r\nstate, that it will \"_open a new channel_ of remittance, and abolish the\r\npractice, by precluding the necessity, of remitting _private fortunes_\r\nby _foreign bottoms_, and that it may lead to some _permanent mode_ for\r\nremittance of private fortunes, and of combining it with the regular\r\nprovision of the Company's investment,--that it will yield _some_ profit\r\nto the Company without risk, and the national gain will be the same as\r\nupon the regular trade.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the combination of this mode of remittance with the Company's\r\ninvestment, nothing can be affirmed concerning it until some\r\nsatisfactory assurance can be held out that such an investment can ever\r\nbe realized. Mr. Hastings and the gentlemen of the Council have not\r\nafforded any ground for such an expectation. That the Indian trade may\r\nbecome a permanent vehicle of the private fortunes of the Company's\r\nservants is very probable,--that is, as permanent as the means of\r\nacquiring fortunes in India; but that _some profit_ will accrue to the\r\nCompany is absolutely impossible. The Company are to bear all the charge\r\noutwards, and a very great part of that homewards; and their only\r\ncompensation is the surplus commission on the sale of other people's\r\ngoods. The nation will undoubtedly avoid great loss and detriment, which\r\nwould be the inevitable consequence of the total cessation of the trade\r\nwith Bengal and the ships returning without cargoes. But if this\r\ntemporary expedient should be improved into a system, no occasional\r\nadvantages to be derived from it would be sufficient to balance the\r\nmischiefs of finding a great Parliamentary corporation turned into a\r\nvehicle for remitting to England the private fortunes of those for whose\r\nbenefit the territorial possessions in India are in effect and substance\r\nunder this project to be _solely_ held.\r\n\r\nBy this extraordinary scheme the Company is totally overturned, and all\r\nits relations inverted. From being a body concerned in trade on their\r\nown account, and employing their servants as factors, the servants have\r\nat one stroke taken the whole trade into their own hands, on their own\r\ncapital of 800,000_l._, at their own risk, and the Company are become\r\nagents and factors to them, to sell by commission _their_ goods for\r\n_their_ profit.\r\n\r\nTo enable your Committee to form some judgment upon the profit which may\r\naccrue to the Company from its new relation and employment, they\r\ndirected that an estimate should be made of the probable proceeds of an\r\ninvestment conducted on the principles of that intended to be realized\r\nfor 1783. By this estimate, which is subjoined,[5] it appears to your\r\nCommittee, that, so far from any surplus profit from this transaction,\r\nthe Bengal adventurers themselves, instead of realizing 2_s._ 2_d._ the\r\nrupee, (the standard they fix for their payment,) will not receive the\r\n1_s._ 9_d._ which is its utmost value in silver at the Mint, nor\r\nprobably above 1_s._ 5_d._ With this certain loss before their eyes, it\r\nis impossible that they can ever complete their subscription, unless, by\r\nmanagement among themselves, they should be able to procure the goods\r\nfor their own account upon other terms than those on which they\r\npurchased them for their masters, or unless they have for the supply of\r\nthe Company on their hands a quantity of goods which they cannot\r\notherwise dispose of. This latter case is not very improbable, from\r\ntheir proposing to send ten sixteenths of the whole investment in\r\nsilk,--which, as will be seen hereafter, the Company has prohibited to\r\nbe sent on their account, as a disadvantageous article. Nothing but the\r\nservants being overloaded can rationally account for their choice of so\r\ngreat a proportion of so dubious a commodity.\r\n\r\nOn the state made by two reports of a committee of the General Court in\r\n1782, their affairs were even then reduced to a low ebb. But under the\r\narrangement announced by Mr. Hastings and his colleagues, it does not\r\nappear, after this period of the servants' investment, from what fund\r\nthe proprietors are to make any dividend at all. The objects of the sale\r\nfrom whence the dividend is to arise are not _their_ goods: they stand\r\naccountable to others for the whole probable produce. The state of the\r\nCompany's commerce will therefore become an object of serious\r\nconsideration: an affair, as your Committee apprehends, of as much\r\ndifficulty as ever tried the faculties of this House. For, on the one\r\nhand, it is plain that the system of providing the Company's import into\r\nEurope, resting almost wholly by an investment from its territorial\r\nrevenues, has failed: during its continuance it was supported on\r\nprinciples fatal to the prosperity of that country. On the other hand,\r\nif the nominal commerce of the Company is suffered to be carried on for\r\nthe account of the servants abroad, by investing the emoluments made in\r\ntheir stations, these emoluments are therefore inclusively authorized,\r\nand with them the practices from which they accrue. All Parliamentary\r\nattempts to reform this system will be contradictory to its institution.\r\nIf, for instance, five hundred thousand pounds sterling annually be\r\nnecessary for this kind of investment, any regulation which may prevent\r\nthe acquisition of that sum operates against the investment which is the\r\nend proposed by the plan.\r\n\r\nOn this new scheme, (which is neither calculated for a future security\r\nnor for a present relief to the Company,) it is not visible in what\r\nmanner the settlements in India can be at all upheld. The gentlemen in\r\nemployments abroad call for the whole produce of the year's investment\r\nfrom Bengal; but for the payment of the counter-investment from Europe,\r\nwhich is for the far greater part sent out for the support of their\r\npower, no provision at all is made: they have not, it seems, agreed that\r\nit should be charged to their account, or that any deduction should be\r\nmade for it from the produce of their sales in Leadenhall Street. How\r\nfar such a scheme is preferable to the total suspension of trade your\r\nCommittee cannot positively determine. In all likelihood, extraordinary\r\nexpedients were necessary; but the causes which induced this necessity\r\nought to be more fully inquired into; for the last step in a series of\r\nconduct may be justifiable upon principles that suppose great blame in\r\nthose which preceded it.\r\n\r\nAfter your Committee had made the foregoing observations upon the plan\r\nof Mr. Hastings and his colleagues, transmitted to the Court of\r\nDirectors, an extract of the Madras Consultations was a few days ago\r\nlaid before us. This extract contains a letter from the Governor-General\r\nand Council of Bengal to the Presidency of Fort St. George, which\r\naffords a very striking, though to your Committee by no means an\r\nunexpected, picture of the instability of their opinions and conduct. On\r\nthe 8th of April the servants had regularly formed and digested the\r\nabove-mentioned plan, which was to form the basis for the investment of\r\ntheir own fortunes, and to furnish the sole means of the commercial\r\nexistence of their masters. Before the 10th of the following May, which\r\nis the date of their letter to Madras, they inform Lord Macartney that\r\nthey had fundamentally altered the whole scheme. \"Instead,\" say they,\r\n\"of allowing the subscribers to retain an interest in the goods, they\r\nare to be provided entirely on account of the Company, and transported\r\n_at their risk_; and the subscribers, instead of receiving certificates\r\npayable out of the produce of the sales in Europe, are to be granted\r\nreceipts, on the payment of their advances, bearing an interest of eight\r\nper cent per annum, until exchanged for drafts on the Court of\r\nDirectors, payable 365 days after sight, at the rate of two shillings\r\nper current rupee,--which drafts shall be granted in the proper time, of\r\nthree eighths of the amount subscribed, on the 31st of December next,\r\nand the remaining five eighths on the 31st of December, 1783.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan of April divests the Company of all property in Bengal goods\r\ntransported to Europe: but in recompense they are freed from all the\r\nrisk and expense, they are not loaded with interest, and they are not\r\nembarrassed with bills. The plan of May reinstates them in their old\r\nrelation: but in return, their revenues in Bengal are charged with an\r\ninterest of eight per cent on the sum subscribed, until bills shall be\r\ndrawn; they are made proprietors of cargoes purchased, under the\r\ndisadvantage of that interest, at their own hazard; they are subjected\r\nto all losses; and they are involved in Europe for payments of bills to\r\nthe amount of eighty lacs of rupees, at two shillings the rupee,--that\r\nis, in bills for eight hundred thousand pounds sterling. It is probably\r\non account of the previous interest of eight per cent that the value of\r\nthe rupee on this scheme is reduced. Mr. Hastings and his colleagues\r\nannounce to Lord Macartney no other than the foregoing alteration in\r\ntheir plan.\r\n\r\nIt is discouraging to attempt any sort of observation on plans thus\r\nshifting their principle whilst their merits are under examination. The\r\njudgment formed on the scheme of April has nothing to do with the\r\nproject of May. Your Committee has not suppressed any part of the\r\nreflections which occurred to them on the former of these plans: first,\r\nbecause the Company knows of no other by any regular transmissions;\r\nsecondly, because it is by no means certain that before the expiration\r\nof June the Governor-General and Council may not revert to the plan of\r\nApril. They speak of that plan as likely to be, or make a part of one\r\nthat shall be, _permanent_. Many reasons are alleged by its authors in\r\nits favor, grounded on the state of their affairs; none whatever are\r\nassigned for the alteration. It is, indeed, morally certain that\r\npersons who had money to remit must have made the same calculation which\r\nhas been made by the directions of your Committee, and the result must\r\nhave been equally clear to them,--which is, that, instead of realizing\r\ntwo shillings and twopence the rupee on their subscription, as they\r\nproposed, they could never hope to see more than one shilling and\r\nninepence. This calculation probably shook the main pillar of the\r\nproject of April. But, on the other hand, as the subscribers to the\r\nsecond scheme can have no certain assurance that the Company will accept\r\nbills so far exceeding their allowance in this particular, the necessity\r\nof remitting their fortunes may beat them back to their old ground. The\r\nDanish Company was the only means of remitting which remained. Attempts\r\nhave been made with success to revive a Portuguese trade for that\r\npurpose. It is by no means clear whether Mr. Hastings and his colleagues\r\nwill adhere to either of the foregoing plans, or, indeed, whether any\r\ninvestment at all to that amount can be realized; because nothing but\r\nthe convenience of remitting the gains of British subjects to London can\r\nsupport any of these projects.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the Company, under this perpetual variation in the\r\nsystem of their investment, is truly perplexing. The manner in which\r\nthey arrive at any knowledge of it is no less so. The letter to Lord\r\nMacartney, by which the variation is discovered, was not intended for\r\ntransmission to the Directors. It was merely for the information of\r\nthose who were admitted to a share of the subscription at Madras. When\r\nMr. Hastings sent this information to those subscribers, he might well\r\nenough have presumed an event to happen which did happen,--that is,\r\nthat a vessel might be dispatched from Madras to Europe: and indeed, by\r\nthat, and by every devisable means, he ought not only to have apprised\r\nthe Directors of this most material change in the plan of the\r\ninvestment, but to have entered fully into the grounds and reasons of\r\nhis making it.\r\n\r\nIt appears to your Committee that the ships which brought to England the\r\nplan of the 8th of April did not sail from Bengal until the 1st of May.\r\nIf the change had been in contemplation for any time before the 30th of\r\nApril, two days would have sufficed to send an account of it, and it\r\nmight have arrived along with the plan which it affected. If, therefore,\r\nsuch a change was in agitation before the sailing of the ships, and yet\r\nwas concealed when it might have been communicated, the concealment is\r\ncensurable. It is not improbable that some change of the kind was made\r\nor meditated before the sailing of the ships for Europe: for it is\r\nhardly to be imagined that reasons wholly unlooked-for should appear for\r\nsetting aside a plan concerning the success of which the Council-General\r\nseemed so very confident, that a new one should be proposed, that its\r\nmerits should be discussed among the moneyed men, that it should be\r\nadopted in Council, and officially ready for transmission to Madras, in\r\ntwelve or thirteen days. In this perplexity of plan and of transmission,\r\nthe Court of Directors may have made an arrangement of their affairs on\r\nthe groundwork of the first scheme, which was officially and\r\nauthentically conveyed to them. The fundamental alteration of that plan\r\nin India might require another of a very different kind in England,\r\nwhich the arrangements taken in consequence of the first might make it\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to execute. What must add to the confusion\r\nis, that the alteration has not the regular and official authority of\r\nthe original plan, and may be presumed to indicate with certainty\r\nnothing more than that the business is _again_ afloat, and that no\r\nscheme is finally determined on. Thus the Company is left without any\r\nfixed data upon which they can make a rational disposition of their\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that the principles and economy of the Company's trade have\r\nbeen so completely corrupted by turning it into a vehicle for tribute,\r\nthat, whenever circumstances require it to be replaced again upon a\r\nbottom truly commercial, hardly anything but confusion and disasters can\r\nbe expected as the first results. Even before the acquisition of the\r\nterritorial revenues, the system of the Company's commerce was not\r\nformed upon principles the most favorable to its prosperity; for,\r\nwhilst, on the one hand, that body received encouragement by royal and\r\nParliamentary charters, was invested with several ample privileges, and\r\neven with a delegation of the most essential prerogatives of the\r\ncrown,--on the other, its commerce was watched with an insidious\r\njealousy, as a species of dealing dangerous to the national interests.\r\nIn that light, with regard to the Company's imports, there was a total\r\nprohibition from domestic use of the most considerable articles of their\r\ntrade,--that is, of all silk stuffs, and stained and painted cottons.\r\nThe British market was in a great measure interdicted to the British\r\ntrader. Whatever advantages might arise to the general trading interests\r\nof the kingdom by this restraint, its East India interest was\r\nundoubtedly injured by it. The Company is also, and has been from a\r\nvery early period, obliged to furnish the Ordnance with a quantity of\r\nsaltpetre at a certain price, without any reference to the standard of\r\nthe markets either of purchase or of sale. With regard to their export,\r\nthey were put also under difficulties upon very mistaken notions; for\r\nthey were obliged to export annually a certain proportion of British\r\nmanufactures, even though they should find for them in India none or but\r\nan unprofitable want. This compulsory export might operate, and in some\r\ninstances has operated, in a manner more grievous than a tax to the\r\namount of the loss in trade: for the payment of a tax is in general\r\ndivided in unequal portions between the vender and consumer, the largest\r\npart falling upon the latter; in the case before us the tax may be as a\r\ndead charge on the trading capital of the Company.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of all these regulations naturally tended to weaken, in the\r\nvery original constitution of the Company, the main-spring of the\r\ncommercial machine, _the principles of profit and loss_. And the\r\nmischief arising from an inattention to those principles has constantly\r\nincreased with the increase of its power. For when the Company had\r\nacquired the rights of sovereignty in India, it was not to be expected\r\nthat the attention to profit and loss would have increased. The idea of\r\nremitting tribute in goods naturally produced an indifference to their\r\nprice and quality,--the goods themselves appearing little else than a\r\nsort of package to the tribute. Merchandise taken as tribute, or bought\r\nin lieu of it, can never long be of a kind or of a price fitted to a\r\nmarket which stands solely on its commercial reputation. The\r\nindifference of the mercantile sovereign to his trading advantages\r\nnaturally relaxed the diligence of his subordinate factor-magistrates\r\nthrough all their gradations and in all their functions; it gave rise,\r\nat least so far as the principal was concerned, to much neglect of price\r\nand of goodness in their purchases. If ever they showed any\r\nextraordinary degrees of accuracy and selection, it would naturally be\r\nin favor of that interest to which they could not be indifferent. The\r\nCompany might suffer above, the natives might suffer below; the\r\nintermediate party must profit to the prejudice of both.\r\n\r\nYour Committee are of opinion that the Company is now arrived at that\r\npoint, when, the investment from surplus revenue or from the spoil of\r\nwar ceasing, it is become much more necessary to fix its commerce upon a\r\ncommercial basis. And this opinion led your Committee to a detailed\r\nreview of all the articles of the Indian traffic upon which the profit\r\nand loss was steady; and we have chosen a period of four years, during\r\nthe continuance of the revenue investment, and prior to any borrowing or\r\nany extraordinary drawing of bills, in order to find out how far the\r\ntrade, under circumstances when it will be necessary to carry it on by\r\nborrowing, or by bills, or by exportation of bullion, can be sustained\r\nin the former course, so as to secure the capital and to afford a\r\nreasonable dividend. And your Committee find that in the first four\r\nyears the investment from Bengal amounted to 4,176,525_l._; upon\r\n2,260,277_l._ there was a gain of 186,337_l._, and upon 1,916,248_l._ a\r\nloss of 705,566_l._: so that the excess of loss above gain, upon the\r\nwhole of the foregoing capital, was in the four years no less than\r\n519,229_l._\r\n\r\nIf the trade were confined to Bengal, and the Company were to trade on\r\nthose terms upon a capital borrowed at eight per cent Indian interest,\r\ntheir revenues in that province would be soon so overpowered with debt,\r\nthat those revenues, instead of supporting the trade, would be totally\r\ndestroyed by it. If, on the other hand, the Company traded upon bills\r\nwith every advantage, far from being in a condition to divide the\r\nsmallest percentage, their bankruptcy here would be inevitable.\r\n\r\nYour Committee then turned to the trade of the other factories and\r\nPresidencies, and they constantly found, that, as the power and dominion\r\nof the Company was less, their profit on the goods was greater. The\r\ninvestments of Madras, Bombay, and Bencoolen have, in the foregoing four\r\nyears, upon a capital of 1,151,176_l._, had a gain upon the whole of\r\n329,622_l._ The greatest of all is that of Bencoolen, which, on a\r\ncapital of 76,571_l._, produced a profit of 107,760_l._ This, however,\r\nis but a small branch of the Company's trade. The trade to China, on a\r\ncapital of 1,717,463_l._, produced an excess of gain amounting to\r\n874,096_l._, which is about fifty per cent. But such was the evil\r\ninfluence of the Bengal investment, that not only the profits of the\r\nChinese trade, but of all the lucrative branches taken together, were so\r\nsunk and ingulfed in it, that the whole profit on a capital of\r\n7,045,164_l._ reached to no more than 684,489_l._, that is, to\r\n189,607_l._ less than the profit on the Chinese trade alone,--less than\r\nthe total profits on the gainful trades taken together, 520,727_l._\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable, that in the year 1778, when the Bengal investment\r\nstood at the highest, that is, so high as 1,223,316_l._, though the\r\nChinese trade produced an excess of gain in that year of 209,243_l._,\r\nand that no loss of moment could be added to that of Bengal, (except\r\nabout 45,000_l._ on the Bombay trade,) the whole profit of a capital of\r\n2,040,787_l._ amounted only to the sum of 9,480_l._\r\n\r\nThe detail of the articles in which loss was incurred or gain made will\r\nbe found in the Appendix, No. 24. The circumstances of the time have\r\nrendered it necessary to call up a vigorous attention to this state of\r\nthe trade of the Company between Europe and India.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL TRADE OF BENGAL.\r\n\r\nThe internal trade of Bengal has next attracted the inquiries of your\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nThe great and valuable articles of the Company's investment, drawn from\r\nthe articles of internal trade, are raw silk, and various descriptions\r\nof piece-goods made of silk and cotton. These articles are not under any\r\nformal monopoly; nor does the Company at present exercise a _declared_\r\nright of preëmption with regard to them. But it does not appear that the\r\ntrade in these particulars is or can be perfectly free,--not so much on\r\naccount of any direct measures taken to prevent it as from the\r\ncircumstances of the country, and the manner of carrying on business\r\nthere: for the present trade, even in these articles, is built from the\r\nruins of old monopolies and preëmptions, and necessarily partakes of the\r\nnature of its materials.\r\n\r\nIn order to show in what manner manufactures and trade so constituted\r\ncontribute to the prosperity of the natives, your Committee conceives it\r\nproper to take, in this place, a short general view of the progress of\r\nthe English policy with relation to the commerce of Bengal, and the\r\nseveral stages and gradations by which it has been brought into its\r\nactual state. The modes of abuse, and the means by which commerce has\r\nsuffered, will be considered in greater detail under the distinct heads\r\nof those objects which have chiefly suffered by them.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the Mogul government, the princes of that race, who\r\nomitted nothing for the encouragement of commerce in their dominions,\r\nbestowed very large privileges and immunities on the English East India\r\nCompany, exempting them from several duties to which their natural-born\r\nsubjects were liable. The Company's _dustuck_, or passport, secured to\r\nthem this exemption at all the custom-houses and toll-bars of the\r\ncountry. The Company, not being able or not choosing to make use of\r\ntheir privilege to the full extent to which it might be carried,\r\nindulged their servants with a qualified use of their passport, under\r\nwhich, and in the name of the Company, they carried on a private trade,\r\neither by themselves or in society with natives, and thus found a\r\ncompensation for the scanty allowances made to them by their masters in\r\nEngland. As the country government was at that time in the fulness of\r\nits strength, and that this immunity existed by a double connivance, it\r\nwas naturally kept within tolerable limits.\r\n\r\nBut by the revolution in 1757 the Company's servants obtained a mighty\r\nascendant over the native princes of Bengal, who owed their elevation to\r\nthe British arms. The Company, which was new to that kind of power, and\r\nnot yet thoroughly apprised of its real character and situation,\r\nconsidered itself still as a trader in the territories of a foreign\r\npotentate, in the prosperity of whose country it had neither interest\r\nnor duty. The servants, with the same ideas, followed their fortune in\r\nthe channels in which it had hitherto ran, only enlarging them with the\r\nenlargement of their power. For their first ideas of profit were not\r\nofficial; nor were their oppressions those of ordinary despotism. The\r\nfirst instruments of their power were formed out of evasions of their\r\nancient subjection. The passport of the Company in the hands of its\r\nservants was no longer under any restraint; and in a very short time\r\ntheir immunity began to cover all the merchandise of the country. Cossim\r\nAli Khân, the second of the Nabobs whom they had set up, was but ill\r\ndisposed to the instruments of his greatness. He bore the yoke of this\r\nimperious commerce with the utmost impatience: he saw his subjects\r\nexcluded as aliens from their own trade, and the revenues of the prince\r\noverwhelmed in the ruin of the commerce of his dominions. Finding his\r\nreiterated remonstrances on the extent and abuse of the passport\r\nineffectual, he had recourse to an unexpected expedient, which was, to\r\ndeclare his resolution at once to annul all the duties on trade, setting\r\nit equally free to subjects and to foreigners.\r\n\r\nNever was a method of defeating the oppressions of monopoly more\r\nforcible, more simple, or more equitable: no sort of plausible objection\r\ncould be made; and it was in vain to think of evading it. It was\r\ntherefore met with the confidence of avowed and determined injustice.\r\nThe Presidency of Calcutta openly denied to the prince the power of\r\nprotecting the trade of his subjects by the remission of his own duties.\r\nIt was evident that his authority drew to its period: many reasons and\r\nmotives concurred, and his fall was hastened by the odium of the\r\noppressions which he exercised voluntarily, as well as of those to which\r\nhe was obliged to submit.\r\n\r\nWhen this example was made, Jaffier Ali Khân, who had been deposed to\r\nmake room for the last actor, was brought from penury and exile to a\r\nstation the terms of which he could not misunderstand. During his life,\r\nand in the time of his children who succeeded to him, parts of the\r\nterritorial revenue were assigned to the Company; and the whole, under\r\nthe name of residency at the Nabob's court, was brought, directly or\r\nindirectly, under the control of British subjects. The Company's\r\nservants, armed with authorities delegated from the nominal government,\r\nor attended with what was a stronger guard, the fame of their own power,\r\nappeared as magistrates in the markets in which they dealt as traders.\r\nIt was impossible for the natives in general to distinguish, in the\r\nproceedings of the same persons, what was transacted on the Company's\r\naccount from what was done on their own; and it will ever be so\r\ndifficult to draw this line of distinction, that as long as the Company\r\ndoes, directly or indirectly, aim at any advantage to itself in the\r\npurchase of any commodity whatever, so long will it be impracticable to\r\nprevent the servants availing themselves of the same privilege.\r\n\r\nThe servants, therefore, for themselves or for their employers,\r\nmonopolized every article of trade, foreign and domestic: not only the\r\nraw merchantable commodities, but the manufactures; and not only these,\r\nbut the necessaries of life, or what in these countries habit has\r\nconfounded with them,--not only silk, cotton, piece-goods, opium,\r\nsaltpetre, but not unfrequently salt, tobacco, betel-nut, and the grain\r\nof most ordinary consumption. In the name of the country government\r\nthey laid on or took off, and at their pleasure heightened or lowered,\r\nall duties upon goods: the whole trade of the country was either\r\ndestroyed or in shackles. The acquisition of the Duanné, in 1765,\r\nbringing the English into the immediate government of the country in its\r\nmost essential branches, extended and confirmed all the former means of\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of these ruinous measures through all their details,\r\ninnumerable grievances were suffered by the native inhabitants, which\r\nwere represented in the strongest, that is, their true colors, in\r\nEngland. Whilst the far greater part of the British in India were in\r\neager pursuit of the forced and exorbitant gains of a trade carried on\r\nby power, contests naturally arose among the competitors: those who were\r\noverpowered by their rivals became loud in their complaints to the Court\r\nof Directors, and were very capable, from experience, of pointing out\r\nevery mode of abuse.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Directors, on their part, began, though very slowly, to\r\nperceive that the country which was ravaged by this sort of commerce was\r\ntheir own. These complaints obliged the Directors to a strict\r\nexamination into the real sources of the mismanagement of their concerns\r\nin India, and to lay the foundations of a system of restraint on the\r\nexorbitancies of their servants. Accordingly, so early as the year 1765,\r\nthey confine them to a trade only in articles of export and import, and\r\nstrictly prohibit them from all dealing in objects of internal\r\nconsumption. About the same time the Presidency of Calcutta found it\r\nnecessary to put a restraint upon themselves, or at least to make show\r\nof a disposition (with which the Directors appear much satisfied) to\r\nkeep their own enormous power within bounds.\r\n\r\nBut whatever might have been the intentions either of the Directors or\r\nthe Presidency, both found themselves unequal to the execution of a plan\r\nwhich went to defeat the projects of almost all the English in\r\nIndia,--possibly comprehending some who were makers of the regulations.\r\nFor, as the complaint of the country or as their own interest\r\npredominated with the Presidency, they were always shifting from one\r\ncourse to the other; so that it became as impossible for the natives to\r\nknow upon what principle to ground any commercial speculation, from the\r\nuncertainty of the law under which they acted, as it was when they were\r\noppressed by power without any color of law at all: for the Directors,\r\nin a few months after they had given these tokens of approbation to the\r\nabove regulations in favor of the country trade, tell the Presidency,\r\n\"It is with concern we see in _every page_ of your Consultations\r\n_restrictions, limitations, prohibitions, affecting various articles of\r\ntrade_.\" On their side, the Presidency freely confess that these\r\nmonopolies of inland trade \"were the foundation of all the bloodsheds,\r\nmassacres, and confusions which have happened of late in Bengal.\"\r\n\r\nPressed in this urgent manner, the Directors came more specifically to\r\nthe grievance, and at once annul all the passports with which their\r\nservants traded without duties, holding out means of compensation, of\r\nwhich it does not appear that any advantage was taken. In order that the\r\nduties which existed should no longer continue to burden the trade\r\neither of the servants or natives, they ordered that a number of\r\noppressive toll-bars should be taken away, and the whole number reduced\r\nto nine of the most considerable.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Clive was sent to Bengal to effect a reformation of the many\r\nabuses which prevailed there, he considered monopoly to be so inveterate\r\nand deeply rooted, and the just rewards of the Company's servants to be\r\nso complicated with that injustice to the country, that the latter could\r\nnot easily be removed without taking away the former. He adopted,\r\ntherefore, a plan for dealing in certain articles, which, as he\r\nconceived, rather ought to be called \"a regulated and restricted trade\"\r\nthan a formal monopoly. By this plan he intended that the profits should\r\nbe distributed in an orderly and proportioned manner for the reward of\r\nservices, and not seized by each individual according to the measure of\r\nhis boldness, dexterity, or influence.\r\n\r\nBut this scheme of monopoly did not subsist long, at least in that mode\r\nand for those purposes. Three of the grand monopolies, those of opium,\r\nsalt, and saltpetre, were successively by the Company taken into their\r\nown hands. The produce of the sale of the two former articles was\r\napplied to the purchase of goods for their investment; the latter was\r\nexported in kind for their sales in Europe. The senior servants had a\r\ncertain share of emolument allotted to them from a commission on the\r\nrevenues. The junior servants were rigorously confined to salaries, on\r\nwhich they were unable to subsist according to their rank. They were\r\nstrictly ordered to abstain from all dealing in objects of internal\r\ncommerce. Those of export and import were left open to young men without\r\nmercantile experience, and wholly unprovided with mercantile capitals,\r\nbut abundantly furnished with large trusts of the public money, and with\r\nall the powers of an absolute government. In this situation, a religious\r\nabstinence from all illicit game was prescribed to men at nine thousand\r\nmiles' distance from the seat of the supreme authority.\r\n\r\nYour Committee is far from meaning to justify, or even to excuse, the\r\noppressions and cruelties used by many in supplying the deficiencies of\r\ntheir regular allowances by all manner of extortion; but many smaller\r\nirregularities may admit some alleviation from thence. Nor does your\r\nCommittee mean to express any desire of reverting to the mode (contrived\r\nin India, but condemned by the Directors) of rewarding the servants of\r\nan higher class by a regulated monopoly. Their object is to point out\r\nthe deficiencies in the system, by which restrictions were laid that\r\ncould have little or no effect whilst want and power were suffered to be\r\nunited.\r\n\r\nBut the proceedings of the Directors at that time, though not altogether\r\njudicious, were in many respects honorable to them, and favorable, in\r\nthe intention at least, to the country they governed. For, finding their\r\ntrading capital employed against themselves and against the natives, and\r\nstruggling in vain against abuses which were inseparably connected with\r\nthe system of their own preference in trade, in the year 1773 they came\r\nto the manly resolution of setting an example to their servants, and\r\ngave up all use of power and influence in the two grand articles of\r\ntheir investment, silk and piece-goods. They directed that the articles\r\nshould be bought at an equal and public market from the native\r\nmerchants; and this order they directed to be published in all the\r\nprincipal marts of Bengal.\r\n\r\nYour Committee are clearly of opinion that no better method of purchase\r\ncould be adopted. But it soon appeared that in deep-rooted and\r\ninveterate abuses the wisest principles of reform may be made to operate\r\nso destructively as wholly to discredit the design, and to dishearten\r\nall persons from the prosecution of it. The Presidency, who seemed to\r\nyield with the utmost reluctance to the execution of these orders, soon\r\nmade the Directors feel their evil influence upon their own investment;\r\nfor they found the silk and cotton cloths rose twenty-five per cent\r\nabove their former price, and a further rise of forty per cent was\r\nannounced to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILK.\r\n\r\nWhat happened with regard to raw silk is still more remarkable, and\r\ntends still more clearly to illustrate the effects of commercial\r\nservitude during its unchecked existence, and the consequences which may\r\nbe made to arise from its sudden reformation. On laying open the trade,\r\nthe article of raw silk was instantly enhanced to the Company full\r\neighty per cent. The contract made for that commodity, wound off in the\r\nBengal method, which used to sell for less than six rupees, or thirteen\r\nshillings, for two pounds' weight, arose to nine rupees, or near twenty\r\nshillings, and the filature silk was very soon after contracted for at\r\nfourteen.\r\n\r\nThe Presidency accounted for this rise by observing that the price had\r\nbefore been _arbitrary_, and that the persons who purveyed for the\r\nCompany paid no more than \"what was _judged_ sufficient for the\r\nmaintenance of the first providers.\" This fact explains more fully than\r\nthe most labored description can do the dreadful effects of the monopoly\r\non the cultivators. They had the _sufficiency_ of their maintenance\r\nmeasured out by the judgment of those who were to profit by their labor;\r\nand this measure was not a great deal more, by their own account, than\r\nabout two thirds of the value of that labor. In all probability it was\r\nmuch less, as these dealings rarely passed through intermediate hands\r\nwithout leaving a considerable profit. These oppressions, it will be\r\nobserved, were not confined to the Company's share, which, however,\r\ncovered a great part of the trade; but as this was an article permitted\r\nto the servants, the same power of arbitrary valuation must have been\r\nextended over the whole, as the market must be equalized, if any\r\nauthority at all is extended over it by those who have an interest in\r\nthe restraint. The price was not only raised, but in the manufactures\r\nthe quality was debased nearly in an equal proportion. The Directors\r\nconceived, with great reason, that this rise of price and debasement of\r\nquality arose, not from the effect of a free market, but from the\r\nservants having taken that opportunity of throwing upon the market of\r\ntheir masters the refuse goods of their own private trade at such\r\nexorbitant prices as by mutual connivance they were pleased to settle.\r\nThe mischief was greatly aggravated by its happening at a time when the\r\nCompany were obliged to pay for their goods with bonds bearing an high\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe perplexed system of the Company's concerns, composed of so many\r\nopposite movements and contradictory principles, appears nowhere in a\r\nmore clear light. If trade continued under restraint, their territorial\r\nrevenues must suffer by checking the general prosperity of the country:\r\nif they set it free, means were taken to raise the price and debase the\r\nquality of the goods; and this again fell upon the revenues, out of\r\nwhich the payment for the goods was to arise. The observations of the\r\nCompany on that occasion are just and sagacious; and they will not\r\npermit the least doubt concerning the policy of these unnatural trades.\r\n\"The amount of our Bengal cargoes, from 1769 to 1773, is 2,901,194_l._\r\nsterling; and if the average increase of price be estimated at\r\ntwenty-five per cent only, the amount of such increase is 725,298_l._\r\nsterling. The above circumstances are exceedingly alarming to us; but\r\nwhat must be our concern, to find by the advices of our President and\r\nCouncil of 1773, that a further advance of forty per cent on Bengal\r\ngoods was expected, and allowed to be the consequence of advertisements\r\nthen published, authorizing a free trade in the service? We find the\r\nDuanné revenues are in general farmed for five years, and the aggregate\r\nincrease estimated at only 183,170_l._ sterling (on a supposition that\r\nsuch increase will be realized); yet if the annual investment be sixty\r\nlacs, and the advance of price thirty per cent only, such advance will\r\n_exceed the increase of the revenue by no less than 829,330l.\r\nsterling_.\"\r\n\r\nThe indignation which the Directors felt at being reduced to this\r\ndistressing situation was expressed to their servants in very strong\r\nterms. They attributed the whole to their practices, and say, \"We are\r\nfar from being convinced that the competition which tends to raise the\r\nprice of goods in Bengal is wholly between public European companies, or\r\nbetween merchants in general who export to foreign markets: we are\r\nrather of opinion that the sources of this grand evil have been the\r\nextraordinary privileges granted to individuals in our service or under\r\nour license to trade without restriction throughout the provinces of\r\nBengal, and the encouragement they have had to extend their trade to the\r\nuttermost, even in such goods as were proper for our investment, by\r\nobserving the success of those persons who have from time to time _found\r\nmeans to dispose of their merchandise to our Governor and Council_,\r\nthough of so bad a quality as to be sold here with great difficulty,\r\nafter having been frequently refused, and put up at the next sale\r\nwithout price, to the very great discredit and disadvantage of the\r\nCompany.\" In all probability the Directors were not mistaken; for, upon\r\nan inquiry instituted soon after, it was found that Cantû Babû, the\r\nbanian or native steward and manager to Mr. Hastings, (late President,)\r\nheld two of these contracts in his own name and that of his son for\r\nconsiderably more than 150,000_l._ This discovery brought on a\r\nprohibition from the Court of Directors of that suspicious and dangerous\r\ndealing in the stewards of persons in high office. The same man held\r\nlikewise farms to the amount of 140,000_l._ a year of the landed\r\nrevenue, with the same suspicious appearance, contrary to the\r\nregulations made under Mr. Hastings's own administration.\r\n\r\nIn the mortifying dilemma to which the Directors found themselves\r\nreduced, whereby the ruin of the revenues either by the freedom or the\r\nrestraint of trade was evident, they considered the first as most rapid\r\nand urgent, and therefore once more revert to the system of their\r\nancient preëmption, and destroy that freedom which they had so lately\r\nand with so much solemnity proclaimed, and that before it could be\r\nabused or even enjoyed. They declare, that, \"unwilling as we are to\r\nreturn to _the former coercive system_ of providing an investment, or to\r\nabridge that freedom of commerce which has been so lately established in\r\nBengal, yet at the same time finding it our indispensable duty to strike\r\nat the _root_ of an evil which has been so severely felt by the Company,\r\nand which can no longer be supported, we hereby direct that all persons\r\nwhatever in the Company's service, _or under our protection_, be\r\nabsolutely prohibited, by public advertisement, from trading in any of\r\nthose articles which compose our investment, directly or indirectly,\r\nexcept on account of and for the East India Company, until their\r\ninvestment is completed.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as this order was received in Bengal, it was construed, as\r\nindeed the words seemed directly to warrant, to exclude all natives as\r\nwell as servants from the trade, until the Company was supplied. The\r\nCompany's preëmption was now authoritatively reëstablished, and some\r\nfeeble and ostensible regulations were made to relieve the weavers who\r\nmight suffer by it. The Directors imagined that the reëstablishment of\r\ntheir coercive system would remove the evil which fraud and artifice had\r\ngrafted upon one more rational and liberal. But they were mistaken; for\r\nit only varied, if it did so much as vary, the abuse. The servants might\r\nas essentially injure their interest by a direct exercise of their power\r\nas by pretexts drawn from the freedom of the natives,--but with this\r\nfatal difference, that the frauds upon the Company must be of shorter\r\nduration under a scheme of freedom. That state admitted, and indeed led\r\nto, means of discovery and correction; whereas the system of coercion\r\nwas likely to be permanent. It carried force further than served the\r\npurposes of those who authorized it: it tended to cover all frauds with\r\nobscurity, and to bury all complaint in despair. The next year,\r\ntherefore, that is, in the year 1776, the Company, who complained that\r\ntheir orders had been extended beyond their intentions, made a third\r\nrevolution in the trade of Bengal. It was set free again,--so far, at\r\nleast, as regarded the native merchants,--but in so imperfect a manner\r\nas evidently to leave the roots of old abuses in the ground. The Supreme\r\nCourt of Judicature about this time (1776) also fulminated a charge\r\nagainst monopolies, without any exception of those authorized by the\r\nCompany: but it does not appear that anything very material was done in\r\nconsequence of it.\r\n\r\nThe trade became nominally free; but the course of business established\r\nin consequence of coercive monopoly was not easily altered. In order to\r\nrender more distinct the principles which led to the establishment of a\r\ncourse and habit of business so very difficult to change as long as\r\nthose principles exist, your Committee think it will not be useless here\r\nto enter into the history of the regulations made in the first and\r\nfavorite matter of the Company's investment, the trade in _raw silk_,\r\nfrom the commencement of these regulations to the Company's perhaps\r\nfinally abandoning all share in the trade which was their object.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAW SILK\r\n\r\nThe trade in _raw silk_ was at all times more popular in England than\r\nreally advantageous to the Company. In addition to the old jealousy\r\nwhich prevailed between the Company and the manufactory interest of\r\nEngland, they came to labor under no small odium on account of the\r\ndistresses of India. The public in England perceived, and felt with a\r\nproper sympathy, the sufferings of the Eastern provinces in all cases in\r\nwhich they might be attributed to the abuses of power exercised under\r\nthe Company's authority. But they were not equally sensible to the evils\r\nwhich arose from a system of sacrificing the being of that country to\r\nthe advantage of this. They entered very readily into the former, but\r\nwith regard to the latter were slow and incredulous. It is not,\r\ntherefore, extraordinary that the Company should endeavor to ingratiate\r\nthemselves with the public by falling in with its prejudices. Thus they\r\nwere led to increase the grievance in order to allay the clamor. They\r\ncontinued still, upon a larger scale, and still more systematically,\r\nthat plan of conduct which was the principal, though not the most\r\nblamed, cause of the decay and depopulation of the country committed to\r\ntheir care.\r\n\r\nWith that view, and to furnish a cheap supply of materials to the\r\nmanufactures of England, they formed a scheme which tended to destroy,\r\nor at least essentially to impair, the whole manufacturing interest of\r\nBengal. A policy of that sort could not fail of being highly popular,\r\nwhen the Company submitted itself as an instrument for the improvement\r\nof British manufactures, instead of being their most dangerous rival, as\r\nheretofore they had been always represented.\r\n\r\nThey accordingly notified to their Presidency in Bengal, in their letter\r\nof the 17th of March, 1769, that \"there was no branch of their trade\r\nthey more ardently wish to extend than that of raw silk.\" They\r\ndisclaim, however, all desire of employing compulsory measures for that\r\npurpose, but recommended every mode of encouragement, and particularly\r\nby augmented wages, \"_in order to induce manufacturers of wrought silk\r\nto quit that branch and take to the winding of raw silk_.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus found means to draw hands from the manufacture, and\r\nconfiding in the strength of a capital drawn from the public revenues,\r\nthey pursue their ideas from the purchase of their manufacture to the\r\npurchase of the material in its crudest state. \"We recommend you to give\r\nan _increased price_, if necessary, _so as to take that trade out of the\r\nhands of other merchants and rival nations_.\" A double bounty was thus\r\ngiven against the manufactures, both in the labor and in the materials.\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable in what manner their vehement pursuit of this\r\nobject led the Directors to a speedy oblivion of those equitable\r\ncorrectives before interposed by them, in order to prevent the mischiefs\r\nwhich were apparent in the scheme, if left to itself. They could venture\r\nso little to trust to the bounties given from the revenues a trade which\r\nhad a tendency to dry up their source, that, by the time they had\r\nproceeded to the thirty-third paragraph of their letter, they revert to\r\nthose very compulsory means which they had disclaimed but three\r\nparagraphs before. To prevent silk-winders from working in their private\r\nhouses, where they might work for private traders, and to confine them\r\nto the Company's factories, where they could only be employed for the\r\nCompany's benefit, they desire that the newly acquired power of\r\ngovernment should be effectually employed. \"Should,\" say they, \"this\r\npractice, through _inattention_, have been suffered to take place again,\r\nit will be proper to put a stop to it, which may _now be more\r\neffectually done by an absolute prohibition, under severe penalties, by\r\nthe authority of government_.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter contains a perfect plan of policy, both of compulsion and\r\nencouragement, which must in a very considerable degree operate\r\ndestructively to the manufactures of Bengal. Its effect must be (so far\r\nas it could operate without being eluded) to change the whole face of\r\nthat industrious country, in order to render it a field for the produce\r\nof crude materials subservient to the manufactures of Great Britain. The\r\nmanufacturing hands were to be seduced from their looms by high wages,\r\nin order to prepare a raw produce for our market; they were to be locked\r\nup in the factories; and the commodity acquired by these operations was,\r\nin this immature state, carried out of the country, whilst its looms\r\nwould be left without any material but the debased refuse of a market\r\nenhanced in its price and scanted in its supply. By the increase of the\r\nprice of this and other materials, manufactures formerly the most\r\nflourishing gradually disappeared under the protection of Great Britain,\r\nand were seen to rise again and flourish on the opposite coast of India,\r\nunder the dominion of the Mahrattas.\r\n\r\nThese restraints and encouragements seem to have had the desired effect\r\nin Bengal with regard to the diversion of labor from manufacture to\r\nmaterials. The trade of raw silk increased rapidly. But the Company very\r\nsoon felt, in the increase of price and debasement of quality of the\r\nwrought goods, a loss to themselves which fully counterbalanced all the\r\nadvantages to be derived to the nation from the increase of the raw\r\ncommodity. The necessary effect on the revenue was also foretold very\r\nearly: for their servants in the principal silk-factories declared that\r\nthe obstruction to the private trade in silk must in the end prove\r\ndetrimental to the revenues, and that the investment clashes with the\r\ncollection of these revenues. Whatsoever by bounties or immunities is\r\nencouraged out of a landed revenue has certainly some tendency to lessen\r\nthe net amount of that revenue, and to forward a produce which does not\r\nyield to the gross collection, rather than one that does.\r\n\r\nThe Directors declare themselves unable to understand how this could be.\r\nPerhaps it was not so difficult. But, pressed as they were by the\r\ngreatness of the payments which they were compelled to make to\r\ngovernment in England, the cries of Bengal could not be heard among the\r\ncontending claims of the General Court, of the Treasury, and of\r\nSpitalfields. The speculation of the Directors was originally fair and\r\nplausible,--so far as the mere encouragement of the commodity extended.\r\nSituated as they were, it was hardly in their power to stop themselves\r\nin the course they had begun. They were obliged to continue their\r\nresolution, at any hazard, increasing the investment. \"The state of our\r\naffairs,\" say they, \"requires the utmost extension of your investments.\r\nYou are not to forbear sending even those sorts _which are attended with\r\nloss_, in case such should be necessary to supply an investment to as\r\ngreat an amount as _you can provide from your own resources_; and we\r\nhave not the least doubt of your being thereby enabled to increase your\r\nconsignments of this valuable branch of national commerce, even to the\r\nutmost of your wishes. But it is our positive order that no part of\r\nsuch investment be provided with borrowed money which is to be repaid by\r\n_drafts upon our treasury in London_; since the license which has\r\nalready been taken in this respect has involved us in difficulties which\r\nwe yet know not how we shall surmount.\"\r\n\r\nThis very instructive paragraph lays open the true origin of the\r\ninternal decay of Bengal. The trade and revenues of that country were\r\n(as the then system must necessarily have been) of secondary\r\nconsideration at best. Present supplies were to be obtained, and present\r\ndemands in England were to be avoided, at every expense to Bengal.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of increasing the investment from revenue at any rate, and\r\nthe resolution of driving all competitors, Europeans or natives, out of\r\nthe market, prevailed at a period still more early, and prevailed not\r\nonly in Bengal, but seems, more or less, to have diffused itself through\r\nthe whole sphere of the Company's influence. In 1768 they gave to the\r\nPresidency of Madras the following memorable instruction, strongly\r\ndeclaratory of their general system of policy.\r\n\r\n\"We shall depend upon your prudence,\" say they, \"to discourage\r\nforeigners; and being intent, as you have been repeatedly acquainted, on\r\nbringing home as great a part of the revenues as possible in your\r\nmanufactures, the outbidding them in those parts where they interfere\r\nwith you would certainly prove an effectual step for answering that end.\r\nWe therefore recommend it to you to offer such increase of price as you\r\nshall deem may be consistently given,--that, by beating them out of the\r\nmarket, the quantities by you to be provided may be proportionally\r\nenlarged; and if you take this method, it is to be so cautiously\r\npractised as not to enhance the prices in the places immediately under\r\nyour control. On this subject we must not omit the approval of your\r\nprohibiting the weavers of Cuddalore from making up any cloth of the\r\nsame sortments that are provided for us; and if such prohibition is not\r\nnow, it should by all means be in future, _made general, and strictly\r\nmaintained_.\"\r\n\r\nThis system must have an immediate tendency towards disordering the\r\ntrade of India, and must finally end in great detriment to the Company\r\nitself. The effect of the restrictive system on the weaver is evident.\r\nThe authority given to the servants to buy at an advanced price did of\r\nnecessity furnish means and excuses for every sort of fraud in their\r\npurchases. The instant the servant of a merchant is admitted on his own\r\njudgment to overbid the market, or to send goods to his master which\r\nshall sell at loss, there is no longer any standard upon which his\r\nunfair practices can be estimated, or any effectual means by which they\r\ncan be restrained. The hope entertained by the Directors, of confining\r\nthis destructive practice of giving an enhanced price to a particular\r\nspot, must ever be found totally delusive. Speculations will be affected\r\nby this artificial price in every quarter in which markets can have the\r\nleast communication with each other.\r\n\r\nIn a very few years the Court of Directors began to feel, even in\r\nLeadenhall Street, _the effects of trading to loss_ upon the revenues,\r\nespecially on those of Bengal. In the letter of February, 1774, they\r\nobserve, that, \"looking back to their accounts for the four preceding\r\nyears, on several of the descriptions of silk there has been an\r\n_increasing loss_, instead of any alteration for the better in the last\r\nyear's productions. This,\" they say, \"threatens the destruction of that\r\nvaluable branch of national commerce.\" And then they recommend _such\r\nregulations_ (as if regulations in that state of things could be of any\r\nservice) as may obtain \"a profit in future, instead of so considerable a\r\nloss, which _we can no longer sustain_.\"\r\n\r\nYour Committee thought it necessary to inquire into the losses which had\r\nactually been suffered by this unnatural forced trade, and find the loss\r\nso early as the season of 1776 to be 77,650_l._, that in the year 1777\r\nit arose to 168,205_l._ This was so great that worse could hardly be\r\napprehended: however, in the season of 1778 it amounted to 255,070_l._\r\nIn 1779 it was not so ruinously great, because the whole import was not\r\nso considerable; but it still stood enormously high,--so high as\r\n141,800_l._ In the whole four years it came to 642,725_l._ The\r\nobservations of the Directors were found to be fully verified. It is\r\nremarkable that the same article in the China trade produced a\r\nconsiderable and uniform profit. On this circumstance little observation\r\nis necessary.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of their struggles for enlarging this losing trade,\r\nwhich they considered as a national object,--what in one point of view\r\nit was, and, if it had not been grossly mismanaged, might have been in\r\nmore than one,--in this part it is impossible to refuse to the Directors\r\na very great share of merit. No degree of thought, of trouble, or of\r\nreasonable expense was spared by them for the improvement of the\r\ncommodity. They framed with diligence, and apparently on very good\r\ninformation, a code of manufacturing regulations for that purpose; and\r\nseveral persons were sent out, conversant in the Italian method of\r\npreparing and winding silk, aided by proper machines for facilitating\r\nand perfecting the work. This, under proper care, and in course of time,\r\nmight have produced a real improvement to Bengal; but in the first\r\ninstance it naturally drew the business from native management, and it\r\ncaused a revulsion from the trade and manufactures of India which led as\r\nnaturally and inevitably to an European monopoly, in some hands or\r\nother, as any of the modes of coercion which were or could be employed.\r\nThe evil was present and inherent in the act. The means of letting the\r\nnatives into the benefit of the improved system of produce was likely to\r\nbe counteracted by the general ill conduct of the Company's concerns\r\nabroad. For a while, at least, it had an effect still worse: for the\r\nCompany purchasing the raw cocoon or silk-pod at a fixed rate, the first\r\nproducer, who, whilst he could wind at his own house, employed his\r\nfamily in this labor, and could procure a reasonable livelihood by\r\nbuying up the cocoons for the Italian filature, now incurred the\r\nenormous and ruinous loss of fifty per cent. This appears in a letter to\r\nthe Presidency, written by Mr. Boughton Rouse, now a member of your\r\nCommittee. But for a long time a considerable quantity of that in the\r\nold Bengal mode of winding was bought for the Company from contractors,\r\nand it continues to be so bought to the present time: but the Directors\r\ncomplain, in their letter of the 12th of May, 1780, that both species,\r\nand particularly the latter, had risen so extravagantly that it was\r\nbecome more than forty per cent dearer than it had been fifteen years\r\nago. In that state of price, they condemn their servants, very justly,\r\nfor entering into contracts for three years,--and that for several\r\nkinds of silk, of very different goodness, upon averages unfairly\r\nformed, where the commodities averaged at an equal price differed from\r\ntwenty to thirty per cent on the sale. Soon after, they formed a regular\r\nscale of fixed prices, above which they found they could not trade\r\nwithout loss.\r\n\r\nWhilst they were continuing these methods to secure themselves against\r\nfuture losses, the Bengal ships which arrived in that year announced\r\nnothing but their continuance. Some articles by the high price, and\r\nothers from their ill quality, were such \"as never could answer to be\r\nsent to Europe at any price.\" The Directors renew their prohibition of\r\nmaking fresh contracts, the present being generally to expire in the\r\nyear 1781. But this trade, whose fundamental policy might have admitted\r\nof a doubt, as applied to Bengal, (whatever it might have been with\r\nregard to England,) was now itself expiring in the hands of the Company,\r\nso that they were obliged to apply to government for power to enlarge\r\ntheir capacity of receiving bills upon Europe. The purchase by these\r\nbills they entirely divert from raw silk, and order to be laid out\r\nwholly in piece-goods.\r\n\r\nThus, having found by experience that this trade, whilst carried on upon\r\nthe old principles, of whatever advantage it might have been to the\r\nBritish manufacturers, or to the individuals who were concerned in it in\r\nBengal, had proved highly detrimental to the Company, the Directors\r\nresolved to expunge the raw silk from their investment. They gave up the\r\nwhole to private traders, on condition of paying the freight, charges,\r\nand duties,--permitting them to send it to Europe in the Company's ships\r\nupon their own account.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this history will serve to demonstrate that all attempts,\r\nwhich in their original system or in their necessary consequences tend\r\nto the distress of India, must, and in a very short time will, make\r\nthemselves felt even by those in whose favor such attempts have been\r\nmade. India may possibly in some future time bear and support itself\r\nunder an extraction of measure [treasure?] or of goods; but much care\r\nought to be taken that the influx of wealth shall be greater in quantity\r\nand prior in time to the waste.\r\n\r\nOn abandoning the trade in silk to private hands, the Directors issued\r\nsome prohibitions to prevent monopoly, and they gave some directions\r\nabout the improvement of the trade. The prohibitions were proper, and\r\nthe directions prudent; but it is much to be feared, that, whilst all\r\nthe means, instruments, and powers remain, by which monopolies were\r\nmade, and through which abuses formerly prevailed, all verbal orders\r\nwill be fruitless.\r\n\r\nThis branch of trade, being so long principally managed by the Company's\r\nservants for the Company and under its authority, cannot be easily taken\r\nout of their hands and pass to the natives, especially when it is to be\r\ncarried on without the control naturally inherent in all participation.\r\nIt is not difficult to conceive how this forced preference of traffic in\r\na raw commodity must have injured the manufactures, while it was the\r\npolicy of the Company to continue the trade on their own account. The\r\nservants, so far from deviating from their course, since they have taken\r\nthe trade into their own management, have gone much further into it. The\r\nproportion of raw silk in the investment is to be augmented. The\r\nproportion of the whole cargoes for the year 1783, divided into sixteen\r\nparts, is ten of raw silk, and six only of manufactured goods. Such is\r\nthe proportion of this losing article in the scheme for the investment\r\nof private fortunes.\r\n\r\nIn the reformed scheme of sending the investment on account of the\r\nCompany, to be paid in bills upon Europe, no mention is made of any\r\nchange of these proportions. Indeed, some limits are attempted on the\r\narticle of silk, with regard to its price; and it is not improbable that\r\nthe price to the master and the servant will be very different: but they\r\ncannot make profitable purchases of this article without strongly\r\ncondemning all the former purchases of the Board of Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOTHS, OR PIECE-GOODS.\r\n\r\nThe general system above stated, relative to the silk trade, must\r\nmaterially have affected the manufactures of Bengal, merely as it was a\r\nsystem of preference. It does by no means satisfactorily appear to your\r\nCommittee that the freedom held out by the Company's various orders has\r\nbeen ever fully enjoyed, or that the grievances of the native merchants\r\nand manufacturers have been redressed; for we find, on good authority,\r\nthat, at that very period at which it might be supposed that these\r\norders had their operation, the oppressions were in full vigor. They\r\nappear to have fallen heaviest on the city of Dacca, formerly the great\r\nstaple for the finest goods in India,--a place once full of opulent\r\nmerchants and dealers of all descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe city and district of Dacca, before the prevalence of the East India\r\nCompany's influence and authority, manufactured annually to about three\r\nhundred thousand pounds' value in cloths. In the year 1776 it had\r\nfallen to about two hundred thousand, or two thirds of its former\r\nproduce. Of this the Company's demand amounted only to a fourth part,\r\nthat is, about fifty thousand pounds yearly. This was at that time\r\nprovided by agents for the Company, under the inspection of their\r\ncommercial servants. On pretence of securing an advantage for this\r\nfourth part for their masters, they exerted a most violent and arbitrary\r\npower over the whole. It was asserted, that they fixed the Company's\r\nmark to such goods as they thought fit, (to all goods, as stated in one\r\ncomplaint,) and disposed of them as they thought proper, excluding not\r\nonly all the native dealers, but the Dutch Company, and private English\r\nmerchants,--that they made advances to the weavers often beyond their\r\nknown ability to repay in goods within the year, and by this means,\r\nhaving got them in debt, held them in perpetual servitude. Their\r\ninability to keep accounts left them at the discretion of the agents of\r\nthe supreme power to make their balances what they pleased, and they\r\nrecovered them, not by legal process, but by seizure of their goods and\r\narbitrary imprisonment of their persons. One and the same dealer made\r\nthe advance, valued the return, stated the account, passed the judgment,\r\nand executed the process.\r\n\r\nMr. Rouse, Chief of the Dacca Province, who struggled against those\r\nevils, says, that in the year 1773 there were no balances due, as the\r\ntrade was then carried on by the native brokers. In less than three\r\nyears these balances amounted to an immense sum,--a sum lost to the\r\nCompany, but existing in full force for every purpose of oppression. In\r\nthe amount of these balances almost every weaver in the country bore a\r\npart, and consequently they were almost all caught in this snare. \"They\r\nare in general,\" says Mr. Rouse, in a letter to General Clavering,\r\ndelivered to your Committee, \"a timid, helpless people; many of them\r\npoor to the utmost degree of wretchedness; incapable of keeping\r\naccounts; industrious as it were by instinct; unable to defend\r\nthemselves, if oppressed; and satisfied, if with continual labor they\r\nderive from the fair dealing and humanity of their employer a moderate\r\nsubsistence for their families.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the people who stood accused by the Company's agents as\r\n_pretending_ grievances, in order to be excused the payment of their\r\nbalances. As to the commercial state of the province in general, Mr.\r\nRouse represents it \"to be for those two years a perpetual scene of\r\ncomplaint and disputation;--the Company's agents professing to pay\r\nhigher rates to weavers, whilst the Leadenhall sales showed an heavy\r\nloss to the Company; the weavers have even travelled in multitudes to\r\nprefer their complaints at the Presidency; the amount of the investment\r\ncomparatively small, with balances comparatively large, and, as I\r\nunderstand, generally contested by the weavers; the native merchants,\r\ncalled _delâls_, removed from their influence, as prejudicial to the\r\nCompany's concerns; and European merchants complaining against undue\r\ninfluence of the Company's commercial agents, in preventing the free\r\npurchase even of those goods which the Company never takes.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of those agents will be fully comprehended from a state of\r\nthe proceedings before Mr. Rouse and Council, on the complaint of a Mr.\r\nCree, an English free merchant at Dacca, who had been twice treated in\r\nthe same injurious manner by the agents of Mr. Hurst, the Commercial\r\nChief at that place. On his complaint to the board of the seizure of the\r\ngoods, and imprisonment of his agents, Mr. Hurst was called upon for an\r\nexplanation. In return he informed them that he had sent to one of the\r\nvillages to inquire concerning the matter of fact alleged. The impartial\r\nperson sent to make this inquiry was the very man accused of the\r\noppressions into which he was sent to examine. The answer of Mr. Hurst\r\nis in an high and determined tone. He does not deny that there are some\r\ninstances of abuse of power. \"But I ask,\" says he, \"what _authority_ can\r\nguard against the conduct of individuals? but that a _single_ instance\r\ncannot be brought of a general depravity.\" Your Committee have reason to\r\nbelieve these coercive measures to have been very general, though\r\nemployed according to the degree of resistance opposed to the monopoly;\r\nfor we find at one time the whole trade of the Dutch involved in the\r\ngeneral servitude. But it appears very extraordinary that nothing but\r\nthe actual proof of a _general_ abuse could affect a practice the very\r\nprinciple of which tends to make the coercion as general as the trade.\r\nMr. Hurst's reflection concerning the abuse of _authority_ is just, but\r\nin this case it is altogether inapplicable; because the complaint was\r\nnot of the abuse, but of the use of authority in matters of trade, which\r\nought to have been free. He throws out a variety of invidious\r\nreflections against the Council, as if they wanted zeal for the\r\nCompany's service; his justification of his practices, and his\r\ndeclaration of his resolution to persevere in them, are firm and\r\ndetermined,--asserting the right and policy of such restraints, and\r\nlaying down a rule for his conduct at the factory, which, he says, will\r\ngive no cause of just complaint to private traders. He adds, \"I have no\r\ndoubt but that they have hitherto provided investments, and it cannot\r\nturn to my interest to preclude them _now_, though I must ever think it\r\nmy duty to combat the private views of individuals who _set themselves\r\nup as competitors_ under that very body under whose license and\r\nindulgence only they can derive their privilege of trade: all I contend\r\nfor is the _same influence_ my employers have ever had.\" He ends by\r\ndeclining any reply to any of their future references of this nature.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this extraordinary letter is inserted in the Appendix, No.\r\n51,--and Mr. Rouse's minute of observations upon it in Appendix, No. 52,\r\nfully refuting the few pretexts alleged in that extraordinary\r\nperformance in support of the trade by influence and authority. Mr.\r\nHollond, one of the Council, joined Mr. Rouse in opinion that a letter\r\nto the purport of that minute should be written; but they were overruled\r\nby Messrs. Purling, Hogarth, and Shakespeare, who passed a resolution to\r\ndefer sending any reply to Mr. Hurst: and none was ever sent. Thus they\r\ngave countenance to the doctrine contained in that letter, as well as to\r\nthe mischievous practices which must inevitably arise from the exercise\r\nof such power. Some temporary and partial relief was given by the\r\nvigorous exertions of Mr. Rouse; but he shortly after removing from that\r\ngovernment, all complaints were dropped.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that, during the long and warm contest between the\r\nCompany's agents and the dealers of Dacca, the Board of Trade seem to\r\nhave taken a decided part against the latter. They allow some sort of\r\njustice in the complaints of the manufacturers with regard to low\r\nvaluation, and other particulars; but they say, that, \"although\" (during\r\nthe time of preëmption) \"it appears that the weavers _were not allowed\r\nthe same liberty of selling to individuals they before enjoyed_, our\r\nopinion on the whole is, that these complaints have originated upon the\r\npremeditated designs of the delâls [factors or brokers] _to thwart the\r\nnew mode_ of carrying on the Company's business, _and to render\r\nthemselves necessary_.\" They say, in another place, that there is no\r\nground for the dissatisfactions and difficulties of the weavers: \"that\r\nthey are owing to the delâls, _whose aim it is to be employed_.\"\r\n\r\nThis desire of being employed, and of rendering themselves necessary, in\r\nmen whose only business it is to be employed in trade, is considered by\r\nthe gentlemen of the board as no trivial offence; and accordingly they\r\ndeclare, \"they have established it as _an invariable rule_, that,\r\n_whatever deficiency_ there might be in the Dacca investment, no\r\npurchase of the manufactures of _that quarter_ shall be made for account\r\nof the Company from private merchants. We have passed this resolution,\r\nwhich we deem of importance, from a persuasion that private merchants\r\nare often _induced_ to make advances for Dacca goods, not by the\r\nordinary chance of sale, but merely from an expectation of disposing of\r\nthem at an enhanced price to the Company, against _whom a rivalship_ is\r\nby this manner encouraged\"; and they say, \"that they intend to observe\r\nthe _same_ rule with respect to the investment of other of the factories\r\nfrom whence similar complaints may come.\"\r\n\r\nThis positive rule is opposed to the positive directions of the Company\r\nto employ those obnoxious persons by preference. How far this violent\r\nuse of authority for the purpose of destroying rivalship has succeeded\r\nin reducing the price of goods to the Company has been made manifest by\r\nthe facts before stated in their place.\r\n\r\nThe recriminatory charges of the Company's agents on the native\r\nmerchants have made very little impression on your Committee. We have\r\nnothing in favor of them, but the assertion of a party powerful and\r\ninterested. In such cases of mutual assertion and denial, your Committee\r\nare led irresistibly to attach abuse to power, and to presume that\r\nsuffering and hardship are more likely to attend on weakness than that\r\nany combination of unprotected individuals is of force to prevail over\r\ninfluence, power, wealth, and authority. The complaints of the native\r\nmerchants ought not to have been treated in any of those modes in which\r\nthey were then treated. And when men are in the situation of\r\ncomplainants against unbounded power, their abandoning their suit is far\r\nfrom a full and clear proof of their complaints being groundless. It is\r\nnot because redress has been rendered impracticable that oppression does\r\nnot exist; nor is the despair of sufferers any alleviation of their\r\nafflictions. A review of some of the most remarkable of the complaints\r\nmade by the native merchants in that province is so essential for laying\r\nopen the true spirit of the commercial administration, and the real\r\ncondition of those concerned in trade there, that your Committee\r\nobserving the records on this subject and at this period full of them,\r\nthey could not think themselves justifiable in not stating them to the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nYour Committee have found many heavy charges of oppression against Mr.\r\nBarwell, whilst Factory Chief at Dacca; which oppressions are stated to\r\nhave continued, and even to have been aggravated, on complaint at\r\nCalcutta. These complaints appear in several memorials presented to the\r\nSupreme Council of Calcutta, of which Mr. Barwell was a member. They\r\nappeared yet more fully and more strongly in a bill in Chancery filed in\r\nthe Supreme Court, which was afterwards recorded before the\r\nGovernor-General and Council, and transmitted to the Court of Directors.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, struck with the magnitude and importance of these\r\ncharges, and finding that with regard to those before the Council no\r\nregular investigation has ever taken place, and finding also that Mr.\r\nBarwell had asserted in a Minute of Council that he had given a full\r\nanswer to the allegations in that bill, ordered a copy of the answer to\r\nbe laid before your Committee, that they might be enabled to state to\r\nthe House how far it appeared to them to be full, how far the charges\r\nwere denied as to the fact, or, where the facts might be admitted, what\r\njustification was set up. It appeared necessary, in order to determine\r\non the true situation of the trade and the merchants of that great city\r\nand district.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary to the Court of Directors has informed your Committee that\r\nno copy of the answer is to be found in the India House; nor has your\r\nCommittee been able to discover that any has been transmitted. On this\r\nfailure, your Committee ordered an application to be made to Mr. Barwell\r\nfor a copy of his answer to the bill, and any other information with\r\nwhich he might be furnished with regard to that subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Barwell, after reciting the above letter, returned in answer what\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\"Whether the records of the Supreme Court of Judicature are lodged at\r\nthe India House I am ignorant, but on those records my answer is\r\ncertainly to be found. At this distance of time I am sorry I cannot from\r\nmemory recover the circumstances of this affair; but this I know, that\r\nthe bill did receive a complete answer, and the people the fullest\r\nsatisfaction: nor is it necessary for me to remark, that [in?] the state\r\nof parties at that time in Bengal, could party have brought forward any\r\nparticle of that bill supported by any verified fact, the principle that\r\nintroduced it in the proceedings of the Governor-General and Council\r\nwould likewise have given the verification of that one circumstance,\r\nwhatever that might have been. As I generally attend in my place in the\r\nHouse, I shall with pleasure answer any invitation of the gentlemen of\r\nthe Committee to attend their investigations up stairs with every\r\ninformation and light in my power to give them.\r\n\r\n\"St. James's Square, 15th April, 1783.\"\r\n\r\nYour Committee considered, that, with regard to the matter charged in\r\nthe several petitions to the board, no sort of specific answer had been\r\ngiven at the time and place where they were made, and when and where the\r\nparties might be examined and confronted. It was considered also, that\r\nthe bill had been transmitted, with other papers relating to the same\r\nmatter, to the Court of Directors, with the knowledge and consent of Mr.\r\nBarwell,--and that he states that his answer had been filed, and no\r\nproceedings had upon it for eighteen months. In that situation it was\r\nthought something extraordinary that no care was taken by him to\r\ntransmit so essential a paper as his answer, and that he had no copy of\r\nit in his hands.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, in this difficulty, thought themselves obliged to\r\ndecline any verbal explanation from the person who is defendant in the\r\nsuit, relative to matters which on the part of the complainant appear\r\nupon record, and to leave the whole matter, as it is charged, to the\r\njudgment of the House to determine how far it may be worthy of a further\r\ninquiry, or how far they may admit such allegations as your Committee\r\ncould not think themselves justified in receiving. To this effect your\r\nCommittee ordered a letter to be written Mr. Barwell; from whom they\r\nreceived the following answer.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,--In consequence of your letter of the 17th, I must request the\r\nfavor of you to inform the Select Committee that I expect from their\r\njustice, on any matter of public record in which I am personally to be\r\nbrought forward to the notice of the House, that they will at the same\r\ntime point out to the House what part of such matter has been verified,\r\nand what parts have not nor ever were attempted to be verified, though\r\nintroduced in debate and entered on the records of the Governor-General\r\nand Council of Bengal. I am anxious the information should be complete,\r\nor the House will not be competent to judge; and if it is complete, it\r\nwill preclude all explanation as unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, Sir,\r\n    \"Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n      \"RICHARD BARWELL.\r\n\r\n  \"St. James's Square, 22nd April, 1783.\r\n\r\n\"P.S. As I am this moment returned from the country, I had it not in my\r\npower to be earlier in acknowledging your letter of the 17th.\"\r\n\r\nYour Committee applied to Mr. Barwell to communicate any papers which\r\nmight tend to the elucidation of matters before them in which he was\r\nconcerned. This he has declined to do. Your Committee conceive that\r\nunder the orders of the House they are by no means obliged to make a\r\ncomplete state of all the evidence which may tend to criminate or\r\nexculpate every person whose transactions they may find it expedient to\r\nreport: this, if not specially ordered, has not hitherto been, as they\r\napprehend, the usage of any committee of this House. It is not for your\r\nCommittee, but for the discretion of the party, to call for, and for the\r\nwisdom of the House to institute, such proceedings as may tend finally\r\nto condemn or acquit. The Reports of your Committee are no charges,\r\nthough they may possibly furnish _matter_ for charge; and no\r\nrepresentations or observations of theirs can either clear or convict on\r\nany proceeding which may hereafter be grounded on the facts which they\r\nproduce to the House. Their opinions are not of a judicial nature. Your\r\nCommittee has taken abundant care that every important fact in their\r\nReport should be attended with the authority for it, either in the\r\ncourse of their reflections or in the Appendix: to report everything\r\nupon every subject before them which is to be found on the records of\r\nthe Company would be to transcribe, and in the event to print, almost\r\nthe whole of those voluminous papers. The matter which appears before\r\nthem is in a summary manner this.\r\n\r\nThe Dacca merchants begin by complaining that in November, 1773, Mr.\r\nRichard Barwell, then Chief of Dacca, had deprived them of their\r\nemployment and means of subsistence; that he had extorted from them\r\n44,224 Arcot rupees (4,731_l._) by the terror of his threats, by long\r\nimprisonment, and cruel confinement in the stocks; that afterwards they\r\nwere confined in a small room near the factory-gate, under a guard of\r\nsepoys; that their food was stopped, and they remained starving a whole\r\nday; that they were not permitted to take their food till next day at\r\nnoon, and were again brought back to the same confinement, in which they\r\nwere continued for six days, and were not set at liberty until they had\r\ngiven Mr. Barwell's banian a certificate for forty thousand rupees; that\r\nin July, 1774, when Mr. Barwell had left Dacca, they went to Calcutta to\r\nseek justice; that Mr. Barwell confined them in his house at Calcutta,\r\nand sent them back under a guard of peons to Dacca; that in December,\r\n1774, on the arrival of the gentlemen from Europe, they returned to\r\nCalcutta, and preferred their complaint to the Supreme Court of\r\nJudicature.\r\n\r\nThe bill in Chancery filed against Richard Barwell, John Shakespeare,\r\nand others, contains a minute specification of the various acts of\r\npersonal cruelty said to be practised by Mr. Barwell's orders, to extort\r\nmoney from these people. Among other acts of a similar nature he is\r\ncharged with having ordered the appraiser of the Company's cloths, who\r\nwas an old man, and who asserts that he had faithfully served the\r\nCompany above sixteen years without the least censure on his conduct, to\r\nbe severely flogged without reason.\r\n\r\nIn the _manner_ of confining the delâls, with ten of their servants, it\r\nis charged on him, that, \"when he first ordered them to be put into the\r\nstocks, it was at a time when the weather was exceedingly bad and the\r\nrain very heavy, without allowing them the least covering for their\r\nheads or any part of their body, or anything to raise them from the wet\r\nground; in which condition they were continued for many hours, until the\r\nsaid Richard Barwell thought proper to remove them into a far worse\r\nstate, if possible, as if studying to exercise the most cruel acts of\r\nbarbarity on them, &c.; and that during their imprisonment they were\r\nfrequently carried to and tortured in the stocks in the middle of the\r\nday, when the scorching heat of the sun was insupportable,\r\nnotwithstanding which they were denied the least covering.\" These men\r\nassert that they had served the Company without blame for thirty\r\nyears,--a period commencing long before the power of the Company in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nIt was no slight aggravation of this severity, that the objects were not\r\nyoung, nor of the lowest of the people, who might, by the vigor of their\r\nconstitutions, or by the habits of hardship, be enabled to bear up\r\nagainst treatment so full of rigor. They were aged persons; they were\r\nmen of a reputable profession.\r\n\r\nThe account given by these merchants of their first journey to Calcutta,\r\nin July, 1774, is circumstantial and remarkable. They say, \"that, on\r\ntheir arrival, _to their astonishment, they soon learned that the\r\nGovernor, who had formerly been violently enraged against the said\r\nRichard Barwell for different improprieties in his conduct, was now\r\nreconciled to him; and that ever since there was a certainty of his\r\nMajesty's appointments taking place in India, from being the most\r\ninveterate enemies they were now become the most intimate friends; and\r\nthat this account soon taught them to believe they were not any nearer\r\njustice from their journey to Calcutta than they had been before at\r\nDacca_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this bill of complaint was, in 1776, laid before the Council, to be\r\ntransmitted to the Court of Directors, Mr. Barwell complained of the\r\nintroduction of such a paper, and asserted, _that he had answered to\r\nevery particular of it on oath about eighteen months, and that during\r\nthis long period no attempt had been made to controvert, refute, or even\r\nto reply to it_.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, think it proper to enter his answer on the records\r\nalong with the bill of whose introduction he complained.\r\n\r\nOn the declarations made by Mr. Barwell in his minute (September, 1776)\r\nyour Committee observe, that, considering him only as an individual\r\nunder prosecution in a court of justice, it might be sufficient for him\r\nto exhibit his defence in the court where he was accused; but that, as a\r\nmember of government, specifically charged before that very government\r\nwith abusing the powers of his office in a very extraordinary manner,\r\nand for purposes (as they allege) highly corrupt and criminal, it\r\nappears to your Committee hardly sufficient to say that he had answered\r\nelsewhere. The matter was to go before the Court of Directors, to whom\r\nthe question of his conduct in that situation, a situation of the\r\nhighest power and trust, was as much at least a question of state as a\r\nmatter of redress to be solely left to the discretion, capacity, or\r\nperseverance of individuals. Mr. Barwell might possibly be generous\r\nenough to take no advantage of his eminent situation; but these\r\nunfortunate people would rather look to his power than his disposition.\r\nIn general, a man so circumstanced and so charged (though we do not know\r\nthis to be the case with Mr. Barwell) might easily contrive by legal\r\nadvantages to escape. The plaintiffs being at a great distance from the\r\nseat of government, and possibly affected by fear or fatigue, or seeing\r\nthe impossibility of sustaining with the ruins of fortunes never perhaps\r\nvery opulent a suit against wealth, power, and influence, a compromise\r\nmight even take place, in which circumstances might make the\r\ncomplainants gladly acquiesce. But the public injury is not in the least\r\nrepaired by the acquiescence of individuals, as it touched the honor of\r\nthe very highest parts of government. In the opinion of your Committee\r\nsome means ought to have been taken to bring the bill to a discussion on\r\nthe merits; or supposing that such decree could not be obtained by\r\nreason of any failure of proceeding on the part of the plaintiffs, that\r\nsome process official or juridical ought to have been instituted against\r\nthem which might prove them guilty of slander and defamation in as\r\nauthentic a manner as they had made their charge, before the Council as\r\nwell as the Court.\r\n\r\nBy the determination of Mr. Hurst, and the resolutions of the Board of\r\nTrade, it is much to be apprehended that the native mercantile interest\r\nmust be exceedingly reduced. The above-mentioned resolutions of the\r\nBoard of Trade, if executed in their rigor, must almost inevitably\r\naccomplish its ruin. The subsequent transactions are covered with an\r\nobscurity which your Committee have not been able to dispel. All which\r\nthey can collect, but that by no means distinctly, is, that, as those\r\nwho trade for the Company in the articles of investment may also trade\r\nfor themselves in the same articles, the old opportunities of\r\nconfounding the capacities must remain, and all the oppressions by which\r\nthis confusion has been attended. The Company's investments, as the\r\nGeneral Letter from Bengal of the 20th of November, 1775, par. 28,\r\nstates the matter, \"are never at a stand; advances are made and goods\r\nare received all the year round.\" Balances, the grand instrument of\r\noppression, naturally accumulate on poor manufacturers who are intrusted\r\nwith money. Where there is not a vigorous rivalship, not only tolerated,\r\nbut encouraged, it is impossible ever to redeem the manufacturers from\r\nthe servitude induced by those unpaid balances.\r\n\r\nNo such rivalship does exist: the policy practised and avowed is\r\ndirectly against it. The reason assigned in the Board of Trade's letter\r\nof the 28th of November, 1778, for its making their advances early in\r\nthe season is, to prevent the foreign merchants and private traders\r\n_interfering_ with the purchase of their (the Company's) assortments.\r\n\"They also refer to the means taken to prevent this interference in\r\ntheir letter of 26th January, 1779.\" It is impossible that the small\r\npart of the trade should not fall into the hands of those who, with the\r\nname and authority of the governing persons, have such extensive\r\ncontracts in their hands. It appears in evidence that natives can hardly\r\ntrade to the best advantage, (your Committee doubt whether they can\r\ntrade to any advantage at all,) if not joined with or countenanced by\r\nBritish subjects. The Directors were in 1775 so strongly impressed with\r\nthis notion, and conceived the native merchants to have been even then\r\nreduced to so low a state, that, notwithstanding the Company's earnest\r\ndesire of giving them a preference, they \"doubt whether there are at\r\nthis time in Bengal native merchants possessed of property adequate to\r\nsuch undertaking, or of credit and responsibility sufficient to make it\r\nsafe and prudent to trust them with such sums as might be necessary to\r\nenable them to fulfil their engagements with the Company.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect which so long continued a monopoly, followed by a preëmption,\r\nand then by partial preferences supported by power, must necessarily\r\nhave in weakening the mercantile capital, and disabling the merchants\r\nfrom all undertakings of magnitude, is but too visible. However, a\r\nwitness of understanding and credit does not believe the capitals of the\r\nnatives to be yet so reduced as to disable them from partaking in the\r\ntrade, if they were otherwise able to put themselves on an equal footing\r\nwith Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties at the outset will, however, be considerable. For the\r\nlong continuance of abuse has in some measure conformed the whole trade\r\nof the country to its false principle. To make a sudden change,\r\ntherefore, might destroy the few advantages which attend any trade,\r\nwithout securing those which must flow from one established upon sound\r\nmercantile principles, whenever such a trade can be established. The\r\nfact is, that the forcible direction which the trade of India has had\r\ntowards Europe, to the neglect, or rather to the total abandoning, of\r\nthe Asiatic, has of itself tended to carry even the internal business\r\nfrom the native merchant. The revival of trade in the native hands is of\r\nabsolute necessity; but your Committee is of opinion that it will\r\nrather be the effect of a regular progressive course of endeavors for\r\nthat purpose than of any one regulation, however wisely conceived.\r\n\r\nAfter this examination into the condition of the trade and traders in\r\nthe principal articles provided for the investment to Europe, your\r\nCommittee proceeded to take into consideration those articles the\r\nproduce of which, after sale in Bengal, is to form a part of the fund\r\nfor the purchase of other articles of investment, or to make a part of\r\nit in kind. These are, 1st, Opium,--2ndly, Saltpetre,--and, 3rdly, Salt.\r\nThese are all monopolized.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPIUM.\r\n\r\nThe first of the internal authorized monopolies is that of opium. This\r\ndrug, extracted from a species of the poppy, is of extensive consumption\r\nin most of the Eastern markets. The best is produced in the province of\r\nBahar: in Bengal it is of an inferior sort, though of late it has been\r\nimproved. This monopoly is to be traced to the very origin of our\r\ninfluence in Bengal. It is stated to have begun at Patna so early as the\r\nyear 1761, but it received no considerable degree of strength or\r\nconsistence until the year 1765, when the acquisition of the Duanné\r\nopened a wide field for all projects of this nature. It was then adopted\r\nand owned as a resource for persons in office,--was managed chiefly by\r\nthe civil servants of the Patna factory, and for their own benefit. The\r\npolicy was justified on the usual principles on which monopolies are\r\nsupported, and on some peculiar to the commodity, to the nature of the\r\ntrade, and to the state of the country: the security against\r\nadulteration; the prevention of the excessive home consumption of a\r\npernicious drug; the stopping an excessive competition, which by an\r\nover-proportioned supply would at length destroy the market abroad; the\r\ninability of the cultivator to proceed in an expensive and precarious\r\nculture without a large advance of capital; and, lastly, the incapacity\r\nof private merchants to supply that capital on the feeble security of\r\nwretched farmers.\r\n\r\nThese were the principal topics on which the monopoly was supported. The\r\nlast topic leads to a serious consideration on the state of the country;\r\nfor, in pushing it, the gentlemen argued, that, in case such private\r\nmerchants should advance the necessary capital, the lower cultivators\r\n\"_would get money in abundance_.\" Admitting this fact, it seems to be a\r\npart of the policy of this monopoly to prevent the cultivator from\r\nobtaining the natural fruits of his labor. Dealing with a private\r\nmerchant, he could not get _money in abundance_, unless his commodity\r\ncould produce an _abundant_ profit. Further reasons, relative to the\r\npeace and good order of the province, were assigned for thus preventing\r\nthe course of trade from the equitable distribution of the advantages of\r\nthe produce, in which the first, the poorest, and the most laborious\r\nproducer ought to have his first share. The cultivators, they add, would\r\nsquander part of the money, and not be able to complete their\r\nengagements to the full; lawsuits, and even battles, would ensue between\r\nthe factors, contending for a deficient produce; and the farmers would\r\ndiscourage the culture of an object which brought so much disturbance\r\ninto their districts. This competition, the operation of which they\r\nendeavor to prevent, is the natural corrective of the abuse, and the\r\nbest remedy which could be applied to the disorder, even supposing its\r\nprobable existence.\r\n\r\nUpon whatever reasons or pretences the monopoly of opium was supported,\r\nthe real motive appears to be the profit of those who were in hopes to\r\nbe concerned in it. As these profits promised to be very considerable,\r\nat length it engaged the attention of the Company; and after many\r\ndiscussions, and various plans of application, it was at length taken\r\nfor their benefit, and the produce of the sale ordered to be employed in\r\nthe purchase of goods for their investment.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1773 it had been taken out of the hands of the Council of\r\nPatna, and leased to two of the natives,--but for a year only. The\r\ncontractors were to supply a certain quantity of opium at a given price.\r\nHalf the value was to be paid to those contractors in advance, and the\r\nother half on the delivery.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings on this contract demonstrated the futility of all the\r\nprinciples on which the monopoly was founded. The Council, as a part of\r\ntheir plan, were obliged, by heavy duties, and by a limitation of the\r\nright of emption of foreign opium to the contractors for the home\r\nproduce, to check the influx of that commodity from the territories of\r\nthe Nabob of Oude and the Rajah of Benares. In these countries no\r\nmonopoly existed; and yet there the commodity was of such a quality and\r\nso abundant as to bear the duty, and even with the duty in some degree\r\nto rival the monopolist even in his own market. There was no complaint\r\nin those countries of want of advances to cultivators, or of lawsuits\r\nand tumults among the factors; nor was there any appearance of the\r\nmultitude of other evils which had been so much dreaded from the\r\nvivacity of competition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, several of the precautions inserted in this contract,\r\nand repeated in all the subsequent, strongly indicated the evils against\r\nwhich it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to guard a monopoly\r\nof this nature and in that country. For in the first contract entered\r\ninto with the two natives it was strictly forbidden to compel the\r\ntenants to the cultivation of this drug. Indeed, very shocking rumors\r\nhad gone abroad, and they were aggravated by an opinion universally\r\nprevalent, that, even in the season immediately following that dreadful\r\nfamine which swept off one third of the inhabitants of Bengal, several\r\nof the poorer farmers were compelled to plough up the fields they had\r\nsown with grain in order to plant them with poppies for the benefit of\r\nthe engrossers of opium. This opinion grew into a strong presumption,\r\nwhen it was seen that in the next year the produce of opium (contrary to\r\nwhat might be naturally expected in a year following such a dearth) was\r\nnearly doubled. It is true, that, when the quantity of land necessary\r\nfor the production of the largest quantity of opium is considered, it is\r\nnot just to attribute that famine to these practices, nor to any that\r\nwere or could be used; yet, where such practices did prevail, they must\r\nhave been very oppressive to individuals, extremely insulting to the\r\nfeelings of the people, and must tend to bring great and deserved\r\ndiscredit on the British government. The English are a people who\r\nappear in India as a conquering nation; all dealing with them is\r\ntherefore, more or less, a dealing with power. It is such when they\r\ntrade on a private account; and it is much more so in any authorized\r\nmonopoly, where the hand of government, which ought never to appear but\r\nto protect, is felt as the instrument in every act of oppression. Abuses\r\nmust exist in a trade and a revenue so constituted, and there is no\r\neffectual cure for them but to entirely cut off their cause.\r\n\r\nThings continued in this train, until the great revolution in the\r\nCompany's government was wrought by the Regulating Act of the thirteenth\r\nof the king. In 1775 the new Council-General appointed by the act took\r\nthis troublesome business again into consideration. General Clavering,\r\nColonel Monson, and Mr. Francis expressed such strong doubts of the\r\npropriety of this and of all other monopolies, that the Directors, in\r\ntheir letter of the year following, left the Council at liberty to throw\r\nthe trade open, under a duty, if they should find it practicable. But\r\nGeneral Clavering, who most severely censured monopoly in general,\r\nthought that this monopoly ought to be retained,--but for a reason which\r\nshows his opinion of the wretched state of the country: for he supposed\r\nit impossible, with the power and influence which must attend British\r\nsubjects in all their transactions, that monopoly could be avoided; and\r\nhe preferred an avowed monopoly, which brought benefit to government, to\r\na virtual engrossing, attended with profit only to individuals. But in\r\nthis opinion he did not seem to be joined by Mr. Francis, who thought\r\nthe suppression of this and of all monopolies to be practicable, and\r\nstrongly recommended their abolition in a plan sent to the Court of\r\nDirectors the year following.[6]\r\n\r\nThe Council, however, submitting to the opinion of this necessity,\r\nendeavored to render that dubious engagement as beneficial as possible\r\nto the Company. They began by putting up the contract to the highest\r\nbidder. The proposals were to be sealed. When the seals came to be\r\nopened, a very extraordinary scene appeared. Every step in this business\r\ndevelops more and more the effect of this junction of public monopoly\r\nand private influence. Four English and eight natives were candidates\r\nfor the contract; three of the English far overbid the eight natives.\r\nThey who consider that the natives, from their superior dexterity, from\r\ntheir knowledge of the country and of business, and from their extreme\r\nindustry, vigilance, and parsimony, are generally an over-match for\r\nEuropeans, and indeed are, and must ultimately be, employed by them in\r\nall transactions whatsoever, will find it very extraordinary that they\r\ndid not by the best offers secure this dealing to themselves. It can be\r\nattributed to this cause, and this only,--that they were conscious,\r\nthat, without power and influence to subdue the cultivators of the land\r\nto their own purposes, they never could afford to engage on the lowest\r\npossible terms. Those whose power entered into the calculation of their\r\nprofits could offer, as they did offer, terms without comparison better;\r\nand therefore one of the English bidders, without partiality, secured\r\nthe preference.\r\n\r\nThe contract to this first bidder, Mr. Griffiths, was prolonged from\r\nyear to year; and as during that time frequent complaints were made by\r\nhim to the Council Board, on the principle that the years answered very\r\ndifferently, and that the business of one year ran into the other,\r\nreasons or excuses were furnished for giving the next contract to Mr.\r\nMackenzie for three years. This third contract was not put up to\r\nauction, as the second had been, and as this ought to have been. The\r\nterms were, indeed, something better for the Company; and the engagement\r\nwas subject to qualifications, which, though they did not remove the\r\nobjection to the breach of the Company's orders, prevented the hands of\r\nthe Directors from being tied up. A proviso was inserted in the\r\ncontract, that it should not be anyways binding, if the Company by\r\norders from home should alter the existing practice with regard to such\r\ndealing.\r\n\r\nWhilst these things were going on, the evils which this monopoly was in\r\nshow and pretence formed to prevent still existed, and those which were\r\nnaturally to be expected from a monopoly existed too. Complaints were\r\nmade of the bad quality of the opium; trials were made, and on those\r\ntrials the opium was found faulty. An office of inspection at Calcutta,\r\nto ascertain its goodness, was established, and directions given to the\r\nProvincial Councils at the places of growth to certify the quantity and\r\nquality of the commodity transmitted to the Presidency.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, notwithstanding an engagement in the contract strictly\r\nprohibiting all compulsory culture of the poppy, information was given\r\nto a member of the Council-General, that fields green with rice had been\r\nforcibly ploughed up to make way for that plant,--and that this was done\r\nin the presence of several English gentlemen, who beheld the spectacle\r\nwith a just and natural indignation. The board, struck with this\r\nrepresentation, ordered the Council of Patna to make an inquiry into the\r\nfact; but your Committee can find no return whatsoever to this order.\r\nThe complaints were not solely on the part of the cultivators against\r\nthe contractor. The contractor for opium made loud complaints against\r\nthe inferior collectors of the landed revenue, stating their undue and\r\nvexatious exactions from the cultivators of opium,--their throwing these\r\nunfortunate people into prison upon frivolous pretences, by which the\r\ntenants were ruined, and the contractor's advances lost. He stated,\r\nthat, if the contractor should interfere in favor of the cultivator,\r\nthen a deficiency would be caused to appear in the landed revenues, and\r\nthat deficiency would be charged on his interposition; he desired,\r\ntherefore, that the cultivators of opium should be taken out of the\r\ngeneral system of the landed revenue, and put under \"his _protection_.\"\r\nHere the effect naturally to be expected from the clashing of\r\ninconsistent revenues appeared in its full light, as well as the state\r\nof the unfortunate peasants of Bengal between such rival protectors,\r\nwhere the ploughman, flying from the tax-gatherer, is obliged to take\r\nrefuge under the wings of the monopolist. No dispute arises amongst the\r\nEnglish subjects which does not divulge the misery of the natives; when\r\nthe former are in harmony, all is well with the latter.\r\n\r\nThis monopoly continuing and gathering strength through a succession of\r\ncontractors, and being probably a most lucrative dealing, it grew to be\r\nevery day a greater object of competition. The Council of Patna\r\nendeavored to recover the contract, or at least the agency, by the most\r\ninviting terms; and in this eager state of mutual complaint and\r\ncompetition between private men and public bodies things continued until\r\nthe arrival in Bengal of Mr. Stephen Sulivan, son of Mr. Sulivan,\r\nChairman of the East India Company, which soon put an end to all strife\r\nand emulation.\r\n\r\nTo form a clear judgment on the decisive step taken at this period, it\r\nis proper to keep in view the opinion of the Court of Directors\r\nconcerning monopolies, against which they had uniformly declared in the\r\nmost precise terms. They never submitted to them, but as to a present\r\nnecessity; it was therefore not necessary for them to express any\r\nparticular approbation of a clause in Mr. Mackenzie's contract which was\r\nmade in favor of their own liberty. Every motive led them to preserve\r\nit. On the security of that clause they could alone have suffered to\r\npass over in silence (for they never approved) the grant of the contract\r\nwhich contained it for three years. It must also be remembered that they\r\nhad from the beginning positively directed that the contract should be\r\nput up to public auction; and this not having been done in Mr.\r\nMackenzie's case, they severely reprimanded the Governor-General and\r\nCouncil in their letter of the 23rd December, 1778.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Directors were perfectly right in showing themselves\r\ntenacious of this regulation,--not so much to secure the best\r\npracticable revenue from their monopoly whilst it existed, but for a\r\nmuch more essential reason, that is, from the corrective which this\r\nmethod administered to that monopoly itself: it prevented the British\r\ncontractor from becoming doubly terrible to the natives, when they\r\nshould see that his contract was in effect _a grant_, and therefore\r\nindicated particular favor and private influence with the ruling members\r\nof an absolute government.\r\n\r\nOn the expiration of Mr. Mackenzie's term, and but a few months after\r\nMr. Sulivan's arrival, the Governor-General, as if the contract was a\r\nmatter of patronage, and not of dealing, pitched upon Mr. Sulivan as the\r\nmost proper person for the management of this critical concern. Mr.\r\nSulivan, though a perfect stranger to Bengal, and to that sort and to\r\nall sorts of local commerce, made no difficulty of accepting it. The\r\nGovernor-General was so fearful that his true motives in this business\r\nshould be mistaken, or that the smallest suspicion should arise of his\r\nattending to the Company's orders, that, far from putting up the\r\ncontract (which, on account of its known profits, had become the object\r\nof such pursuit) to _public auction_, he did not wait for receiving so\r\nmuch as a _private proposal_ from Mr. Sulivan. The Secretary perceived\r\nthat in the rough draught of the contract the old recital of a proposal\r\nto the board was inserted as a matter of course, but was contrary to the\r\nfact; he therefore remarked it to Mr. Hastings. Mr. Hastings, with great\r\nindifference, ordered that recital to be _omitted_; and the omission,\r\nwith the remark that led to it, has, with the same easy indifference,\r\nbeen sent over to his masters.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General and Council declare themselves apprehensive that\r\nMr. Sulivan might be a loser by his bargain, upon account of troubles\r\nwhich they supposed existing in the country which was the object of it.\r\nThis was the more indulgent, because the contractor was tolerably\r\nsecured against all losses. He received a certain price for his\r\ncommodity; but he was not obliged to pay any certain price to the\r\ncultivator, who, having no other market than his, must sell it to him at\r\nhis own terms. He was to receive half the yearly payment by _advance_,\r\nand he was not obliged to advance to the cultivator more than what he\r\nthought expedient; but if this should not be enough, he might, if he\r\npleased, draw the _whole_ payment before the total delivery: such were\r\nthe terms of the engagement with him. He is a contractor of a new\r\nspecies, who employs no capital whatsoever of his own, and has the\r\nmarket of compulsion at his entire command. But all these securities\r\nwere not sufficient for the anxious attention of the Supreme Council to\r\nMr. Sulivan's welfare: Mr. Hastings had before given him the contract\r\nwithout any proposal on his part; and to make their gift perfect, in a\r\nsecond instance they proceed a step beyond their former ill precedent,\r\nand they contract with Mr. Sulivan for _four_ years.\r\n\r\nNothing appears to have been considered but the benefit of the\r\ncontractor, and for this purpose the solicitude shown in all the\r\nprovisions could not be exceeded. One of the first things that struck\r\nMr. Hastings as a blemish on his gift was the largeness of the penalty\r\nwhich he had on former occasions settled as the sanction of the\r\ncontract: this he now discovered to be so great as to be likely to\r\nfrustrate its end by the impossibility of recovering so large a sum. How\r\na large penalty can prevent the recovery of any, even the smallest part\r\nof it, is not quite apparent. In so vast a concern as that of opium, a\r\nfraud which at first view may not appear of much importance, and which\r\nmay be very difficult in the discovery, may easily counterbalance the\r\nreduced penalty in this contract, which was settled in favor of Mr.\r\nSulivan at about 20,000_l._\r\n\r\nMonopolies were (as the House has observed) only tolerated evils, and at\r\nbest upon trial; a clause, therefore, was inserted in the contracts to\r\nMackenzie, annulling the obligation, if the Court of Directors should\r\nresolve to abolish the monopoly; but at the request of Mr. Sulivan the\r\ncontract was without difficulty purged of this obnoxious clause. The\r\nterm was made absolute, the monopoly rendered irrevocable, and the\r\ndiscretion of the Directors wholly excluded. Mr. Hastings declared the\r\nreserved condition to be no longer necessary, \"because the Directors had\r\napproved the monopoly.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs and Councils at the principal factories had been obliged to\r\ncertify the quantity and quality of the opium before its transport to\r\nCalcutta; and their control over the contractor had been assigned as the\r\nreason for not leaving to those factories the management of this\r\nmonopoly. Now things were changed. Orders were sent to discontinue this\r\nmeasure of invidious precaution, and the opium was sent to Calcutta\r\nwithout anything done to ascertain its quality or even its quantity.\r\n\r\nAn office of inspection had been also appointed to examine the quality\r\nof the opium on its delivery at the capital settlement. In order to ease\r\nMr. Sulivan from this troublesome formality, Mr. Hastings abolished the\r\noffice; so that Mr. Sulivan was then totally freed from all examination,\r\nor control whatsoever, either first or last.\r\n\r\nThese extraordinary changes in favor of Mr. Sulivan were attended with\r\nlosses to others, and seem to have excited much discontent. This\r\ndiscontent it was necessary in some manner to appease. The\r\nvendue-master, who was deprived of his accustomed dues on the public\r\nsales of the opium by the private dealing, made a formal complaint to\r\nthe board against this, as well as other proceedings relative to the\r\nsame business. He attributed the private sale to \"_reasons of state_\";\r\nand this strong reflection both on the Board of Trade and the Council\r\nBoard was passed over without observation. He was quieted by appointing\r\nhim to the duty of these very inspectors whose office had been just\r\nabolished as useless. The House will judge of the efficacy of the\r\nrevival of this office by the motives to it, and by Mr. Hastings giving\r\nthat to _one_ as _a compensation_ which had been executed by several as\r\n_a duty_. However, the orders for taking away the precautionary\r\ninspection at Patna still remained in force.\r\n\r\nSome benefits, which had been given to former contractors at the\r\ndiscretion of the board, were no longer held under that loose\r\nindulgence, but were secured to Mr. Sulivan by his contract. Other\r\nindulgences, of a lesser nature, and to which no considerable objection\r\ncould be made, were on the application of a Mr. Benn, calling himself\r\nhis attorney, granted.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, examining Mr. Higginson, late a member of the Board of\r\nTrade, on that subject, were informed, that this contract, very soon\r\nafter the making, was generally understood at Calcutta to have been sold\r\nto this Mr. Benn, but he could not particularize the sum for which it\r\nhad been assigned,--and that Mr. Benn had afterwards sold it to a Mr.\r\nYoung. By this transaction it appears clearly that the contract was\r\ngiven to Mr. Sulivan for no other purpose than to supply him with a sum\r\nof money; and the sale and re-sale seem strongly to indicate that the\r\nreduction of the penalty, and the other favorable conditions, were not\r\ngranted for his ease in a business which he never was to execute, but to\r\nheighten the value of the object which he was to sell. Mr. Sulivan was\r\nat the time in Mr. Hastings's family, accompanied him in his progresses,\r\nand held the office of Judge-Advocate.\r\n\r\nThe monopoly given for these purposes thus permanently secured, all\r\npower of reformation cut off, and almost every precaution against fraud\r\nand oppression removed, the Supreme Council found, or pretended to find,\r\nthat the commodity for which they had just made such a contract was not\r\na salable article,--and in consequence of this opinion, or pretence,\r\nentered upon a daring speculation hitherto unthought of, that of sending\r\nthe commodity on the Company's account to the market of Canton. The\r\nCouncil alleged, that, the Dutch being driven from Bengal, and the seas\r\nbeing infested with privateers, this commodity had none, or a very dull\r\nand depreciated demand.\r\n\r\nHad this been true, Mr. Hastings's conduct could admit of no excuse. He\r\nought not to burden a falling market by long and heavy engagements. He\r\nought studiously to have kept in his power the means of proportioning\r\nthe supply to the demand. But his arguments, and those of the Council on\r\nthat occasion, do not deserve the smallest attention. Facts, to which\r\nthere is no testimony but the assertion of those who produce them in\r\napology for the ill consequences of their own irregular actions, cannot\r\nbe admitted. Mr. Hastings and the Council had nothing at all to do with\r\nthat business: the Court of Directors had wholly taken the management of\r\nopium out of his and their hands, and by a solemn adjudication fixed it\r\nin the Board of Trade. But after it had continued there some years, Mr.\r\nHastings, a little before his grant of the monopoly to Mr. Sulivan,\r\nthought proper to reverse the decree of his masters, and by his own\r\nauthority to recall it to the Council. By this step he became\r\nresponsible for all the consequences.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade appear, indeed, to merit reprehension for disposing\r\nof the opium by private contract, as by that means the unerring standard\r\nof the public market cannot be applied to it. But they justified\r\nthemselves by their success; and one of their members informed your\r\nCommittee that their last sale had been a good one: and though he\r\napprehended a fall in the next, it was not such as in the opinion of\r\nyour Committee could justify the Council-General in having recourse to\r\nuntried and hazardous speculations of commerce. It appears that there\r\nmust have been a market, and one sufficiently lively. They assign as a\r\nreason of this assigned [alleged?] dulness of demand, that the Dutch had\r\nbeen expelled from Bengal, and could not carry the usual quantity to\r\nBatavia. But the Danes were not expelled from Bengal, and Portuguese\r\nships traded there: neither of them were interdicted at Batavia, and the\r\ntrade to the eastern ports was free to them. The Danes actually applied\r\nfor and obtained an increase of the quantity to which their purchases\r\nhad been limited; and as they asked, so they received this indulgence as\r\na great favor. It does not appear that they were not very ready to\r\nsupply the place of the Dutch. On the other hand, there is no doubt that\r\nthe Dutch would most gladly receive an article, convenient, if not\r\nnecessary, to the circulation of their commerce, from the Danes, or\r\nunder any name; nor was it fit that the Company should use an extreme\r\nstrictness in any inquiry concerning the necessary disposal of one of\r\ntheir own staple commodities.\r\n\r\nThe supply of the Canton treasury with funds for the provision of the\r\nnext year's China investment was the ground of this plan. But the\r\nCouncil-General appear still to have the particular advantage of Mr.\r\nSulivan in view,--and, not satisfied with breaking so many of the\r\nCompany's orders for that purpose, to make the contract an object\r\nsalable to the greatest advantage, were obliged to transfer their\r\npersonal partiality from Mr. Sulivan to the contract itself, and to hand\r\nit over to the assignees through all their successions. When the opium\r\nwas delivered, the duties and emoluments of the contractor ended; but\r\n(it appears from Mr. Williamson's letter, 18th October, 1781, and it is\r\nnot denied by the Council-General) this new scheme _furnished them with\r\na pretext of making him broker for the China investment, with the profit\r\nof a new commission_,--to what amount does not appear. But here their\r\nconstant and vigilant observer, the vendue-master, met them again:--they\r\nseemed to live in no small terror of this gentleman. To satisfy him for\r\nthe loss of his fee to which he was entitled upon the public sale, they\r\ngave _him_ also a commission of one per cent on the investment. Thus was\r\nthis object loaded with a double commission; and every act of partiality\r\nto one person produced a chargeable compensation to some other for the\r\ninjustice that such partiality produced. Nor was this the whole. The\r\ndiscontent and envy excited by this act went infinitely further than to\r\nthose immediately affected, and something or other was to be found out\r\nto satisfy as many as possible.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was discovered that the Council entertained a design of\r\nopening a trade on those principles, it immediately engaged the\r\nattention of such as had an interest in speculations of freight.\r\n\r\nA memorial seems to have been drawn early, as it is dated on the 29th of\r\nMarch, though it was not the first publicly presented to the board. This\r\nmemorial was presented on the 17th of September, 1781, by Mr. Wheler,\r\nconformably (as he says) to the desire of the Governor-General; and it\r\ncontained a long and elaborate dissertation on the trade to China,\r\ntending to prove the advantage of extending the sale of English\r\nmanufactures and other goods to the North of that country, beyond the\r\nusual emporium of European nations. This ample and not ill-reasoned\r\ntheoretical performance (though not altogether new either in speculation\r\nor attempt) ended by a practical proposition, very short, indeed, of the\r\nideas opened in the preliminary discourse, but better adapted to the\r\nimmediate effect. It was, that the Company should undertake the sale of\r\nits own opium in China, and commit the management of the business to the\r\nmemorialist, who offered to furnish them with a strong armed ship for\r\nthat purpose. The offer was accepted, and the agreement made with him\r\nfor the transport of two thousand chests.\r\n\r\nA proposal by another person was made the July following the date of\r\nthis project: it appears to have been early in the formal delivery at\r\nthe board: this was for the export of one thousand four hundred and\r\neighty chests. This, too, was accepted, but with new conditions and\r\nrestrictions: for in so vast and so new an undertaking great\r\ndifficulties occurred. In the first place, all importation of that\r\ncommodity is rigorously forbidden by the laws of China. The impropriety\r\nof a political trader, who is lord over a great empire, being concerned\r\nin a contraband trade upon his own account, did not seem in the least to\r\naffect them; but they were struck with the obvious danger of subjecting\r\ntheir goods to seizure by the vastness of the prohibited import. To\r\nsecure the larger adventure, they require of the China factory that\r\nColonel Watson's ship should enter the port of Canton as an _armed\r\nship_, (they would not say a ship of war, though that must be meant,)\r\nthat her cargo should not be reported; they also ordered that other\r\nmeasures should be adopted to secure this prohibited article from\r\nseizure. If the cargo should get in safe, another danger was in\r\nview,--the overloading the Chinese market by a supply beyond the demand;\r\nfor it is obvious that contraband trade must exist by small quantities\r\nof goods poured in by intervals, and not by great importations at one\r\ntime. To guard against this inconvenience, they divide their second,\r\nthough the smaller adventure, into two parts; one of which was to go to\r\nthe markets of the barbarous natives which inhabit the coast of Malacca,\r\nwhere the chances of its being disposed of by robbery or sale were at\r\nleast equal. If the opium should be disposed of there, the produce was\r\nto be invested in merchandise salable in China, or in dollars, if to be\r\nhad. The other part (about one half) was to go in kind directly to the\r\nport of Canton.\r\n\r\nThe dealing at this time seemed closed; but the gentlemen who chartered\r\nthe ships, always recollecting something, applied anew to the board to\r\nbe furnished with cannon from the Company's ordnance. Some was\r\ndelivered to them; but the Office of Ordnance (so heavily expensive to\r\nthe Company) was not sufficient to spare a few iron guns for a merchant\r\nship. Orders were given to cast a few cannon, and an application made to\r\nMadras, at a thousand miles' distance, for the rest. Madras answers,\r\nthat they cannot exactly comply with the requisition; but still the\r\nboard at Bengal _hopes_ better things from them than they promise, and\r\nflatter themselves that with their assistance they shall properly arm a\r\nship of thirty-two guns.\r\n\r\nWhilst these dispositions were making, the first proposer, perceiving\r\nadvantages from the circuitous voyage of the second which had escaped\r\nhis observation, to make amends for his first omission, improved both on\r\nhis own proposal and on that of the person who had improved on him. He\r\ntherefore applied for leave to take two hundred and fifty chests on his\r\nown account, which he said could \"be _readily disposed of_ at the\r\nseveral places where it was necessary for the ship to touch for wood and\r\nwater, or intelligence, during her intended voyage through _the Eastern\r\nIslands_.\" As a corrective to this extraordinary request, he assured the\r\nboard, that, if he should meet with any unexpected delay at these\r\nmarkets, he would send their cargo to its destination, having secured a\r\n_swift-sailing_ sloop for the _protection_ of his ship; and this sloop\r\nhe proposed, in such a case, to leave behind. Such an extraordinary\r\neagerness to deal in opium lets in another view of the merits of the\r\nalleged dulness of the market, on which this trade was undertaken for\r\nthe Company's account.\r\n\r\nThe Council, who had with great condescension and official facility\r\nconsented to every demand hitherto made, were not reluctant with regard\r\nto this last. The quantity of opium required by the freighters, and the\r\npermission of a trading voyage, were granted without hesitation. The\r\ncargo having become far more valuable by this small infusion of private\r\ninterest, the armament which was deemed sufficient to defend the\r\nCompany's large share of the adventure was now discovered to be unequal\r\nto the protection of the whole. For the convoy of these two ships the\r\nCouncil hire and arm another. How they were armed, or whether in fact\r\nthey were properly armed at all, does not appear. It is true that the\r\nSupreme Council proposed that these ships should also convey supplies to\r\nMadras; but this was a secondary consideration: their primary object was\r\nthe adventure of opium. To this they were permanently attached, and were\r\nobliged to attend to its final destination.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of disposing of the opium according to this project being\r\nthus got over, a material preliminary difficulty still stood in the way\r\nof the whole scheme. The contractor, or his assignees, were to be paid.\r\nThe Company's treasure was wholly exhausted, and even its credit was\r\nexceedingly strained. The latter, however, was the better resource, and\r\nto this they resolved to apply. They therefore, at different times,\r\nopened two loans of one hundred thousand pounds each. The first was\r\nreserved for the Company's servants, civil and military, to be\r\ndistributed in shares according to their rank; the other was more\r\ngeneral. The terms of both loans were, that the risk of the voyage was\r\nto be on account of _the Company_. The payment was to be in bills (at a\r\nrate of exchange settled from the supercargoes at Canton) upon the same\r\nCompany. In whatever proportion the adventure should fail, either in the\r\nships not safely arriving in China or otherwise, in that proportion the\r\nsubscribers were to content themselves with the Company's bonds for\r\ntheir money, bearing eight per cent interest. A share in this\r\nsubscription was thought exceeding desirable; for Mr. Hastings writes\r\nfrom Benares, where he was employed in the manner already reported and\r\nhereafter to be observed upon, requesting that the subscription should\r\nbe left open to his officers who were employed in the military\r\noperations against Cheyt Sing; and accordingly three majors, seven\r\ncaptains, twenty-three lieutenants, the surgeon belonging to the\r\ndetachment, and two civil servants of high rank who attended him, were\r\nadmitted to subscribe.\r\n\r\nBills upon Europe without interest are always preferred to the Company's\r\nbonds, even at the high interest allowed in India. They are, indeed, so\r\ngreedily sought there, and (because they tend to bring an immediate and\r\nvisible distress in Leadenhall Street) so much dreaded here, that by an\r\nact of Parliament the Company's servants are restricted from drawing\r\nbills beyond a certain amount upon the Company in England. In Bengal\r\nthey have been restrained to about one hundred and eighty thousand\r\npounds annually. The legislature, influenced more strongly with the same\r\napprehensions, has restrained the Directors, as the Directors have\r\nrestrained their servants, and have gone so far as to call in the power\r\nof the Lords of the Treasury to authorize the acceptance of any bills\r\nbeyond an amount prescribed in the act.\r\n\r\nThe false principles of this unmercantile transaction (to speak of it in\r\nthe mildest terms) were too gross not to be visible to those who\r\ncontrived it. That the Company should be made to borrow such a sum as\r\ntwo hundred thousand pounds[7] at eight per cent, (or terms deemed by\r\nthe Company to be worse,) in order first to buy a commodity represented\r\nby themselves as depreciated in its ordinary market, in order afterwards\r\nto carry one half of it through a circuitous trading voyage, depending\r\nfor its ultimate success on the prudent and fortunate management of two\r\nor three sales, and purchases and re-sales of goods, and the chance of\r\ntwo or three markets, with all the risks of sea and enemy, was plainly\r\nno undertaking for such a body. The activity, private interest, and the\r\nsharp eye of personal superintendency may now and then succeed in such\r\nprojects; but the remote inspection and unwieldy movements of great\r\npublic bodies can find nothing but loss in them. Their gains,\r\ncomparatively small, ought to be upon sure grounds; but here (as the\r\nCouncil states the matter) the private trader actually declines to deal,\r\nwhich is a proof more than necessary to demonstrate the extreme\r\nimprudence of such an undertaking on the Company's account. Still\r\nstronger and equally obvious objections lay to that member of the\r\nproject which regards the introduction of a contraband commodity into\r\nChina, sent at such a risk of seizure not only of the immediate object\r\nto be smuggled in, but of all the Company's property in Canton, and\r\npossibly at a hazard to the existence of the British factory at that\r\nport.\r\n\r\nIt is stated, indeed, that a monopolizing company in Canton, called the\r\nCohong, had reduced commerce there to a deplorable state, and had\r\nrendered the gains of private merchants, either in opium or anything\r\nelse, so small and so precarious that they were no longer able by\r\npurchasing that article to furnish the Company with money for a China\r\ninvestment. For this purpose the person whose proposal is accepted\r\ndeclares his project to be to set up a monopoly on the part of the\r\nCompany against the monopoly of the Chinese merchants: but as the\r\nChinese monopoly is at home, and supported (as the minute referred to\r\nasserts) by the country magistrates, it is plain it is the Chinese\r\ncompany, not the English, which must prescribe the terms,--particularly\r\nin a commodity which, if withheld from them at their market price, they\r\ncan, whenever they please, be certain of purchasing as a condemned\r\ncontraband.\r\n\r\nThere are two further circumstances in this transaction which strongly\r\nmark its character. The first is, that this adventure to China was not\r\nrecommended to them by the factory of Canton; it was dangerous to\r\nattempt it without their previous advice, and an assurance, grounded on\r\nthe state of the market and the dispositions of the government, that the\r\nmeasure, in a commercial light, would be profitable, or at least safe.\r\nNeither was that factory applied to on the state of the bills which,\r\nupon their own account, they might be obliged to draw upon Europe, at a\r\ntime when the Council of Bengal direct them to draw bills to so enormous\r\nan amount.\r\n\r\nThe second remarkable circumstance is, that the Board of Trade in\r\nCalcutta (the proper administrator of all that relates to the Company's\r\ninvestment) does not seem to have given its approbation to the project,\r\nor to have been at all consulted upon it. The sale of opium had been\r\nadjudged to the Board of Trade for the express purpose of selling it in\r\nBengal, not in China,--and of employing the produce of such sale in the\r\nmanufactures of the country in which the original commodity was\r\nproduced. On the whole, it appears a mere trading speculation of the\r\nCouncil, invading the department of others, without lights of its own,\r\nwithout authority or information from any other quarter. In a commercial\r\nview, it straitened the Company's investment to which it was destined;\r\nas a measure of finance, it is a contrivance by which a monopoly formed\r\nfor the increase of revenue, instead of becoming one of its resources,\r\ninvolves the treasury, in the first instance, in a debt of two hundred\r\nthousand pounds.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Hastings, on the expiration of Mr. Mackenzie's contract, the\r\nadvantages of which to the Company had been long doubtful, had put\r\nhimself in a situation to do his duty, some immediate loss to the\r\nrevenue would have been the worst consequence of the alleged\r\ndepreciation; probably it would not have been considerable. Mr.\r\nMackenzie's contract, which at first was for three years, had been only\r\nrenewed for a year. Had the same course been pursued with Mr. Sulivan,\r\nthey would have had it in their power to adopt some plan which might\r\nhave secured them from any loss at all. But they pursued another plan:\r\nthey carefully put all remedy still longer out of their reach by giving\r\ntheir contract for four years. To cover all these irregularities, they\r\ninterest the settlement in their favor by holding out to them the most\r\ntempting of all baits in a chance of bills upon Europe.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the servants abroad have conducted themselves with regard\r\nto Mr. Sulivan's contract for opium, and the disposal of the commodity.\r\nIn England the Court of Directors took it into consideration. First, as\r\nto the contract, in a letter dated 12th July, 1782, they say, that,\r\n\"having condemned the contract entered into with Mr. Mackenzie for the\r\nprovision of opium, they cannot but be _surprised_ at your having\r\nconcluded a new contract for _four_ years relative to that article with\r\nMr. Stephen Sulivan, without leaving the decision of it to the Court of\r\nDirectors.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentiments of the Directors are proper, and worthy of persons in\r\npublic trust. Their _surprise_, indeed, at the disobedience to their\r\norders is not perfectly natural in those who for many years have\r\nscarcely been obeyed in a single instance. They probably asserted their\r\nauthority at this time with as much vigor as their condition admitted.\r\n\r\nThey proceed: \"We do not mean,\" say they, \"to convey any censure on Mr.\r\nSulivan respecting the transaction; but we cannot withhold our\r\ndispleasure from the Governor-General and Council at such an instance of\r\n_contempt_ of our authority.\" They then proceed justly to censure the\r\nremoval of the inspection, and some other particulars of this gross\r\nproceeding. As to the criminality of the parties, it is undoubtedly true\r\nthat a breach of duty in servants is highly aggravated by the rank,\r\nstation, and trust of the offending party; but no party, in such\r\nconspiracy to break orders, appear to us wholly free from fault.\r\n\r\nThe Directors did their duty in reprobating this contract; but it is the\r\nopinion of your Committee that further steps ought to be taken to\r\ninquire into the legal validity of a transaction which manifestly\r\nattempts to prevent the Court of Directors from applying any remedy to\r\na grievance which has been for years the constant subject of complaints.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Sulivan and Mr. Hastings are the Company's servants, bound by\r\ntheir covenants and their oaths to promote the interest of their\r\nmasters, and both equally bound to be obedient to their orders. If the\r\nGovernor-General had contracted with a stranger, not apprised of the\r\nCompany's orders, and not bound by any previous engagement, the contract\r\nmight have been good; but whether a contract made between two servants,\r\ncontrary to the orders of their common master, and to the prejudice of\r\nhis known interest, be a breach of trust on both sides, and whether the\r\ncontract can in equity have force to bind the Company, whenever they\r\nshall be inclined to free themselves and the country they govern from\r\nthis mischievous monopoly, your Committee think a subject worthy of\r\nfurther inquiry.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the disposal of the opium, the Directors very properly\r\ncondemn the direct contraband, but they approve the trading voyage. The\r\nDirectors have observed nothing concerning the loans: they probably\r\nreserved that matter for future consideration.\r\n\r\nIn no affair has the connection between servants abroad and persons in\r\npower among the proprietors of the India Company been more discernible\r\nthan in this. But if such confederacies, cemented by such means, are\r\nsuffered to pass without due animadversion, the authority of Parliament\r\nmust become as inefficacious as all other authorities have proved to\r\nrestrain the growth of disorders either in India or in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT.\r\n\r\nThe reports made by the two committees of the House which sat in the\r\nyears 1772 and 1773 of the state and conduct of the inland trade of\r\nBengal up to that period have assisted the inquiries of your Committee\r\nwith respect to the third and last article of monopoly, viz., that of\r\nsalt, and made it unnecessary for them to enter into so minute a detail\r\non that subject as they have done on some others.\r\n\r\nYour Committee find that the late Lord Clive constantly asserted that\r\nthe salt trade in Bengal had been a monopoly time immemorial,--that it\r\never was and ever must be a monopoly,--and that Coja Wazid, and other\r\nmerchants long before him, had given to the Nabob and his ministers two\r\nhundred thousand pounds per annum for the exclusive privilege. The\r\nDirectors, in their letter of the 24th December, 1776, paragraph 76,\r\nsay, \"that it has ever been in a great measure an exclusive trade.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secret Committee report,[8] that under the government of the Nabobs\r\nthe duty on salt made in Bengal was two and an half per cent paid by\r\nMussulmen, and five per cent paid by Gentoos. On the accession of Mir\r\nCassim, in 1760, the claim of the Company's servants to trade in salt\r\nduty-free was first avowed. Mr. Vansittart made an agreement with him by\r\nwhich the duties should be fixed at nine per cent. The Council annulled\r\nthe agreement, and reduced the duty to two and an half per cent. On this\r\nMir Cassim ordered that no customs or duties whatsoever should be\r\ncollected for the future. But a majority of the Council (22nd March,\r\n1763) resolved, that the making the exemption general was a breach of\r\nthe Company's privileges, and that the Nabob should be positively\r\nrequired to recall it, and collect duties as before from the country\r\nmerchants, and all other persons who had not the protection of the\r\nCompany's _dustuck_. The Directors, as the evident reason of the thing\r\nand as their duty required, disapproved highly of these transactions,\r\nand ordered (8th February, 1764) _a final and effectual stop to be put\r\nto the inland trade in salt_, and several other articles of commerce.\r\nBut other politics and other interests prevailed, so that in the May\r\nfollowing a General Court resolved, that it should be recommended to the\r\nCourt of Directors to reconsider the preceding orders; in consequence of\r\nwhich the Directors ordered the Governor and Council to form a plan, in\r\nconcert with the Nabob, for regulating the inland trade.\r\n\r\nOn these last orders Lord Clive's plan was formed, in 1765, for\r\nengrossing the sole purchase of salt, and dividing the profits among the\r\nCompany's senior servants. The Directors, who had hitherto reluctantly\r\ngiven way to a monopoly under any ideas or for any purposes, disapproved\r\nof this plan, and on the 17th May, 1766, ordered it to be abolished; but\r\nthey substituted no other in its room.[9] In this manner things\r\ncontinued until November, 1767, when the Directors repeated their orders\r\nfor excluding all persons whatever, excepting the natives only, from\r\nbeing concerned in the inland trade in salt; and they declared that\r\n(vide par. 90) \"_such trade is hereby abolished and put a final end\r\nto_.\" In the same letter (par. 92) they ordered that the salt trade\r\nshould be laid open to the natives in general, subject to such a duty\r\nas might produce one hundred and twenty thousand pounds a year. This\r\npolicy was adopted by the legislature. In the act of 1773 it was\r\nexpressly provided, that it should not be lawful for any of his\r\nMajesty's subjects to engage, intermeddle, or be any way concerned,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, in the inland trade in salt, except on the India\r\nCompany's account.\r\n\r\nUnder the positive orders of the Company, the salt trade appears to have\r\ncontinued open from 1768 to 1772. The act, indeed, contained an\r\nexception in favor of the Company, and left them a liberty of dealing in\r\nsalt upon their own account. But still this policy remained unchanged,\r\nand their orders unrevoked. But in the year 1772, without any\r\ninstruction from the Court of Directors indicating a change of opinion\r\nor system, the whole produce was again monopolized, professedly for the\r\nuse of the Company, by Mr. Hastings. Speaking of this plan, he says\r\n(letter to the Directors, 22d February, 1775): \"No new hardship has been\r\nimposed upon the salt manufacturers by taking the management of that\r\narticle into the hands of government; the only difference is, that the\r\nprofit which was before reaped by English gentlemen and by banians is\r\nnow acquired by the Company.\" In May, 1766, the Directors had condemned\r\nthe monopoly _on any conditions whatsoever_. \"At that time they thought\r\nit neither consistent with their honor nor their dignity to promote such\r\nan exclusive trade.\"[10] \"They considered it, too, as disgraceful, _and\r\nbelow the dignity of their present situation_, to allow of such a\r\nmonopoly, and that, were they to allow it under any restrictions, they\r\nshould consider themselves as assenting and subscribing to all the\r\nmischiefs which Bengal had presented to them for four years past.\"[11]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this solemn declaration, in their letter of 24th\r\nDecember, 1776, they approve the plan of Mr. Hastings, and say, \"that\r\nthe monopoly, _on its present footing_, can be no considerable grievance\r\nto the country,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was a rigorous monopoly. The account given of it by\r\nGeneral Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr. Francis, in their minute of\r\n11th January, 1775, in which the situation of the _molungees_, or\r\npersons employed in the salt manufacture, is particularly described, is\r\nstated at length in the Appendix. Mr. Hastings himself says, \"The power\r\nof obliging molungees to work has been customary from time immemorial.\"\r\n\r\nNothing but great and clear advantage to government could account for,\r\nand nothing at all perhaps could justify, the revival of a monopoly thus\r\ncircumstanced. The advantage proposed by its revival was the\r\ntransferring the profit, which was before reaped by English gentlemen\r\nand banians, to the Company. The profits of the former were not\r\nproblematical. It was to be seen what the effect would be of a scheme to\r\ntransfer them to the latter, even under the management of the projector\r\nhimself. In the Revenue Consultations of September, 1776, Mr. Hastings\r\nsaid, \"Many causes have since combined to reduce this article of revenue\r\n_almost to nothing_. The plan which I am _now_ inclined to recommend for\r\nthe future management of the salt revenue differs widely from that\r\nwhich I adopted under different circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that the ill success of his former scheme did not deter him\r\nfrom recommending another. Accordingly, in July, 1777, Mr. Hastings\r\nproposed, and it was resolved, that the salt mahls should be let, _with_\r\nthe lands, to the farmers and zemindars for a ready-money rent,\r\nincluding duties,--the salt to be left to their disposal. After some\r\ntrial of this method, Mr. Hastings thought fit to abandon it. In\r\nSeptember, 1780, he changed his plan a third time, and proposed the\r\ninstitution of a _salt office_; the salt was to be again engrossed for\r\nthe benefit of the Company, and the management conducted by a number of\r\nsalt agents.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding facts it appears that in this branch of the Company's\r\ngovernment little regard has been paid to the ease and welfare of the\r\nnatives, and that the Directors have nowhere shown greater inconsistency\r\nthan in their orders on this subject. Yet salt, considering it as a\r\nnecessary of life, was by no means a safe and proper subject for so many\r\nexperiments and innovations. For ten years together the Directors\r\nreprobated the idea of suffering this necessary of life to be engrossed\r\non _any condition whatsoever_, and strictly prohibited all Europeans\r\nfrom trading in it. Yet, as soon as they were made to expect from Mr.\r\nHastings that the profits of the monopoly should be converted to their\r\nown use, they immediately declared that it \"could be no considerable\r\ngrievance to the country,\" and authorized its continuance, until he\r\nhimself, finding it produced little or nothing, renounced it of his own\r\naccord. Your Committee are apprehensive that this will at all times,\r\nwhatever flattering appearance it may wear for a time, be the fate of\r\nany attempt to monopolize the salt for the profit of government. In the\r\nfirst instance it will raise the price on the consumer beyond its just\r\nlevel; but that evil will soon be corrected by means ruinous to the\r\nCompany as monopolists, viz., by the embezzlement of their own salt, and\r\nby the importation of foreign salt, neither of which the government of\r\nBengal may have power for any long time to prevent. In the end\r\ngovernment will probably be undersold and beaten down to a losing price.\r\nOr, if they should attempt to force all the advantages from this article\r\nof which by every exertion it may be made capable, it may distress some\r\nother part of their possessions in India, and destroy, or at least\r\nimpair, the natural intercourse between them. Ultimately it may hurt\r\nBengal itself, and the produce of its landed revenue, by destroying the\r\nvent of that grain which it would otherwise barter for salt.\r\n\r\nYour Committee think it hardly necessary to observe, that the many\r\nchanges of plan which have taken place in the management of the salt\r\ntrade are far from honorable to the Company's government,--and that,\r\neven if the monopoly of this article were a profitable concern, it\r\nshould not be permitted. Exclusive of the general effect of this and of\r\nall monopolies, the oppressions which the manufacturers of salt, called\r\n_molungees_, still suffer under it, though perhaps alleviated in some\r\nparticulars, deserve particular attention. There is evidence enough on\r\nthe Company's records to satisfy your Committee that these people have\r\nbeen treated with great rigor, and not only defrauded of the due payment\r\nof their labor, but delivered over, like cattle, in succession, to\r\ndifferent masters, who, under pretence of buying up the balances due to\r\ntheir preceding employers, find means of keeping them in perpetual\r\nslavery. For evils of this nature there can be no perfect remedy as long\r\nas the monopoly continues. They are in the nature of the thing, and\r\ncannot be cured, or effectually counteracted, even by a just and\r\nvigilant administration on the spot. Many objections occur to the\r\nfarming of any branch of the public revenue in Bengal, particularly\r\nagainst farming the salt lands. But the dilemma to which government by\r\nthis system is constantly reduced, of authorizing great injustice or\r\nsuffering great loss, is alone sufficient to condemn it. Either\r\ngovernment is expected to support the farmer or contractor in all his\r\npretensions by an exertion of power, which tends of necessity to the\r\nruin of the parties subjected to the farmer's contract, and to the\r\nsuppression of free trade,--or, if such assistance be refused him, he\r\ncomplains that he is not supported, that private persons interfere with\r\nhis contract, that the manufacturers desert their labor, and that\r\nproportionate deductions must be allowed him.\r\n\r\nAfter the result of their examination into the general nature and effect\r\nof this monopoly, it remains only for your Committee to inquire whether\r\nthere was any valid foundation for that declaration of Mr. Hastings\r\nwhich we conclude must have principally recommended the monopoly of salt\r\nto the favor of the Court of Directors, viz., \"that the profit, which\r\nwas before reaped by English gentlemen, and by banians, was now acquired\r\nby the Company.\" On the contrary, it was proved and acknowledged before\r\nthe Governor-General and Council, when they inquired into this matter,\r\nin March, 1775, that the Chiefs and Councils of those districts in which\r\nthere were salt mahls reserved particular salt farms for their _own_\r\nuse, and divided the profits, in certain stated proportions, among\r\nthemselves and their assistants. But, unless a detail of these\r\ntransactions, and of the persons concerned in them, should be called for\r\nby the House, it is our wish to avoid entering into it. On one example\r\nonly your Committee think it just and proper to insist, stating first to\r\nthe House on what principles they have made this selection.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing their inquiries, your Committee have endeavored chiefly to\r\nkeep in view the conduct of persons in the highest station, particularly\r\nof those in whom the legislature, as well as the Company, have placed a\r\nspecial confidence,--judging that the conduct of such persons is not\r\nonly most important in itself, but most likely to influence the\r\nsubordinate ranks of the service. Your Committee have also examined the\r\nproceedings of the Court of Directors on all those instances of the\r\nbehavior of their servants that seemed to deserve, and did sometimes\r\nattract, their immediate attention. They constantly find that the\r\nnegligence of the Court of Directors has kept pace with, and must\r\nnaturally have quickened, the growth of the practices which they have\r\ncondemned. Breach of duty abroad will always go hand in hand with\r\nneglect of it at home. In general, the Court of Directors, though\r\nsufficiently severe in censuring offences, and sometimes in punishing\r\nthose whom they have regarded as offenders of a lower rank, appear to\r\nhave suffered the most conspicuous and therefore the most dangerous\r\nexamples of disobedience and misconduct in the first department of their\r\nservice to pass with a feeble and ineffectual condemnation. In those\r\ncases which they have deemed too apparent and too strong to be\r\ndisregarded even with safety to themselves, and against which their\r\nheaviest displeasure has been declared, it appears to your Committee\r\nthat their interference, such as it was, had a mischievous rather than a\r\nuseful tendency. A total neglect of duty in this respect, however\r\nculpable, is not to be compared, either in its nature or in its\r\nconsequences, with the destructive principles on which they have acted.\r\nIt has been their practice, if not system, to inquire, to censure, and\r\nnot to punish. As long as the misconduct of persons in power in Bengal\r\nwas encouraged by nothing but the hopes of concealment, it may be\r\npresumed that they felt some restraint upon their actions, and that they\r\nstood in some awe of the power placed over them; whereas it is to be\r\napprehended that the late conduct of the Court of Directors tells them,\r\nin effect, that they have nothing to fear from the certainty of a\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nOn the same principle on which your Committee have generally limited\r\ntheir researches to the persons placed by Parliament or raised or put in\r\nnomination by the Court of Directors to the highest station in Bengal,\r\nit was also their original wish to limit those inquiries to the period\r\nat which Parliament interposed its authority between the Company and\r\ntheir servants, and gave a new constitution to the Presidency of Fort\r\nWilliam. If the Company's servants had taken a new date from that\r\nperiod, and if from thenceforward their conduct had corresponded with\r\nthe views of the legislature, it is probable that a review of the\r\ntransactions of remoter periods would not have been deemed necessary,\r\nand that the remembrance of them would have been gradually effaced and\r\nfinally buried in oblivion. But the reports which your Committee have\r\nalready made have shown the House that from the year 1772, when those\r\nproceedings commenced in Parliament on which the act of the following\r\nyear was founded, abuses of every kind have prevailed and multiplied in\r\nBengal to a degree unknown in former times, and are perfectly sufficient\r\nto account for the present distress of the Company's affairs both at\r\nhome and abroad. The affair which your Committee now lays before the\r\nHouse occupies too large a space in the Company's records, and is of too\r\nmuch importance in every point of view, to be passed over.\r\n\r\nYour Committee find that in March, 1775, a petition was presented to the\r\nGovernor-General and Council by a person called Coja Kaworke, an\r\nArmenian merchant, resident at Dacca, (of which division Mr. Richard\r\nBarwell had lately been Chief,) setting forth in substance, that in\r\nNovember, 1772, the petitioner had farmed a certain salt district,\r\ncalled Savagepoor, and had entered into a contract with the Committee of\r\nCircuit for providing and delivering to the India Company the salt\r\nproduced in that district; that in 1773 he farmed another, called\r\nSelimabad, on similar conditions. He alleges, that in February, 1774,\r\nwhen Mr. Barwell arrived at Dacca, he charged the petitioner with\r\n1,25,500 rupees, (equal to 13,000_l._,) as a contribution, and, in order\r\nto levy it, did the same year deduct 20,799 rupees from the amount of\r\nthe _advance money_ which was ordered to be paid to the petitioner, on\r\naccount of the India Company, for the provision of salt in the two\r\nfarms, and, after doing so, compelled the petitioner to execute and\r\ngive him four different bonds for 77,627 rupees, in the name of one\r\nPorran Paul, for the remainder of such contribution, or unjust profit.\r\n\r\nSuch were the allegations of the petition relative to the unjust\r\nexaction. The harsh means of compelling the payment make another and\r\nvery material part; for the petitioner asserts, that, in order to\r\nrecover the amount of these bonds, guards were placed over him, and that\r\nMr. Barwell by ill usage and oppressions recovered from him at different\r\ntimes 48,656 Arcot rupees, besides 283 rupees extorted by the\r\nguard,--that, after this payment, two of the bonds, containing 36,313\r\nrupees, were restored to him, and he was again committed to the charge\r\nof four _peons_, or guards, to pay the amount of the remaining two\r\nbonds. The petition further charges, that the said gentleman and his\r\npeople had also extorted from the petitioner other sums of money, which,\r\ntaken together, amounted to 25,000 rupees.\r\n\r\nBut the heaviest grievance alleged by him is, that, after the sums of\r\nmoney had been extorted on account of the farms, the faith usual in such\r\ntransactions is allowed not to have been kept; but, after the petitioner\r\nhad been obliged to buy or compound for the farms, that they were taken\r\nfrom him,--\"that the said Richard Barwell, Esquire, about his departure\r\nfrom Dacca, in October, 1774, for self-interest wrested from the\r\npetitioner the aforesaid two mahls, (or districts,) and farmed them to\r\nanother person, notwithstanding he had extorted from the petitioner a\r\nconsiderable sum of money on account of those purgunnahs.\"\r\n\r\nTo this petition your Committee find two accounts annexed, in which the\r\nsums said to be paid to or taken by Mr. Barwell, and the respective\r\ndates of the several payments, are specified; and they find that the\r\naccount of particulars agrees with and makes up the gross sum charged in\r\nthe petition.\r\n\r\nMr. Barwell's immediate answer to the preceding charge is contained in\r\ntwo letters to the board, dated 23rd and 24th of March, 1775. The answer\r\nis remarkable. He asserts, that \"the whole of Kaworke's relation is a\r\ngross misrepresentation of facts;--that the simple fact was, that in\r\nJanuary, 1774, the salt mahls of Savagepoor and Selimabad became _his_,\r\nand were re-let by _him_ to this man, in the names of Bussunt Roy and\r\nKissen Deb, on condition that he should account with him [_Mr. Barwell_]\r\nfor profits to a certain sum, and that he [_Mr. Barwell_] engaged for\r\nSavagepoor _in the persuasion of its being a very profitable farm_\"; and\r\nhe concludes with saying, \"If I am mistaken in my reasoning, and _the\r\nwish to add to my fortune has warped my judgment_, in a transaction that\r\nmay appear to the board in a light different to what I view it in, it is\r\npast,--I cannot recall it,--and I rather choose to admit an error than\r\ndeny a fact.\" In his second letter he says, \"To the Honorable Court of\r\nDirectors I will submit all my rights in the salt contracts I engaged\r\nin; and if in their opinion those rights vest in the Company, I will\r\naccount to them for the last shilling I have received from such\r\ncontracts, my intentions being upright; and as I never did wish to\r\nprofit myself to the prejudice of my employers, by their judgment I will\r\nbe implicitly directed.\"\r\n\r\nThe majority of the board desired that Kaworke's petition should be\r\ntransmitted to England by the ship then under dispatch; and it was\r\naccordingly sent with Mr. Barwell's replies. Mr. Barwell moved that a\r\ncommittee should be appointed to take into consideration what he had to\r\noffer on the subject of Kaworke's petition; and a committee was\r\naccordingly appointed, consisting of all the members of the Council\r\nexcept the Governor-General.\r\n\r\nThe committee opened their proceedings with reading a second petition\r\nfrom Kaworke, containing corrected accounts of cash said to be forcibly\r\ntaken, and of the extraordinary and unwarrantable profits taken or\r\nreceived from him by Richard Barwell, Esquire; all which are inserted at\r\nlarge in the Appendix. By these accounts Mr. Barwell is charged with a\r\nbalance or debt of 22,421 rupees to Kaworke. The principal difference\r\nbetween him and Mr. Barwell arises from a different mode of stating the\r\naccounts acknowledged to exist between them. In the account current\r\nsigned by Mr. Barwell, he gives Kaworke credit for the receipt of 98,426\r\nrupees, and charges him with a balance of 27,073 rupees.\r\n\r\nThe facts stated or admitted by Mr. Barwell are as follow: that the salt\r\nfarms of Selimabad and Savagepoor were _his_, and re-let by him to the\r\ntwo Armenian merchants, Michael and Kaworke, on condition of their\r\npaying him 1,25,000 rupees, exclusive of their engagements to the\r\nCompany; that the engagement was written in the name of Bussunt Roy and\r\nKissen Deb Sing; and Mr. Barwell says, that the reason of its being \"in\r\nthese people's names was because _it was not thought consistent with the\r\npublic regulations that the names of any Europeans should appear_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that this policy was carried to still greater length.\r\nMeans were used to remove such an obnoxious proceeding, as far as\r\npossible, from the public eye; and they were such as will strongly\r\nimpress the House with the facility of abuse and the extreme difficulty\r\nof detection in everything which relates to the Indian administration.\r\nFor these substituted persons were again represented by the further\r\nsubstitution of another name, viz., _Rada Churn Dey_, whom Mr. Barwell\r\nasserts to be a real person living at Dacca, and who _stood for the\r\nfactory of Dacca_; whereas the Armenian affirms that there was _no_ such\r\nperson as _Rada Churn_, and that it was a fictitious name.\r\n\r\nMr. Barwell, in his justification, proceeds to affirm, that Coja Kaworke\r\nnever had the management of the salt mahls, \"_but on condition of\r\naccounting to the former Chief, and to Mr. Barwell, for a specified\r\nadvantage arising from them_,--that Mr. Barwell determined, _without he\r\ncould reconcile the interests of the public with his own private\r\nemoluments_, that he would not engage in this concern,--and that, when\r\nhe took an interest in it, _it was for specified benefit in money_, and\r\nevery condition in the public engagement to be answered.\"\r\n\r\nYour Committee have stated the preceding facts in the same terms in\r\nwhich they are stated by Mr. Barwell. The House is to judge how far they\r\namount to a defence against the charges contained in Kaworke's petition,\r\nor to an admission of the truth of the principal part of it. Mr. Barwell\r\ndoes not allow that compulsion was used to extort the money which he\r\nreceived from the petitioner, or that the latter was dispossessed of the\r\nfarms in consequence of an offer made to Mr. Barwell by another person\r\n(Ramsunder Paulet) to pay him a lac of rupees more for them. The truth\r\nof _these_ charges has not been ascertained. They were declared by Mr.\r\nBarwell to be false, but no attempt was made by him to invalidate or\r\nconfute them, though it concerned his reputation, and it was his duty,\r\nin the station wherein he was placed, that charges of such a nature\r\nshould have been disproved,--at least, the accuser should have been\r\npushed to the proof of them. Nothing of this kind appears to have been\r\ndone, or even attempted.\r\n\r\nThe transaction itself, as it stands, is clearly collusive; the form in\r\nwhich it is conducted is clandestine and mysterious in an extraordinary\r\ndegree; and the acknowledged object of it a great illicit profit, to be\r\ngained by an agent and trustee of the Company at the expense of his\r\nemployers, and of which he confesses he has received a considerable\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThe committee of the Governor-General and Council appear to have closed\r\ntheir proceedings with several resolutions, which, with the answers\r\ngiven by Mr. Barwell as a defence, are inserted in the Appendix. The\r\nwhole are referred thither together, on account of the ample extent of\r\nthe answer. These papers will be found to throw considerable light not\r\nonly on the points in question, but on the general administration of the\r\nCompany's revenues in Bengal. On some passages in Mr. Barwell's defence,\r\nor account of his conduct, your Committee offer the following remarks to\r\nthe judgment of the House.\r\n\r\nIn his letter of the 23rd March, 1775, he says, that he engaged for\r\nSavagepoor _in the persuasion of its being a very profitable farm_. In\r\nthis place your Committee think it proper to state the 17th article of\r\nthe regulations of the Committee of Circuit, formed in May, 1772, by\r\nthe President and Council, of which Mr. Barwell was a member, together\r\nwith their own observations thereupon.\r\n\r\n    17th. \"That no peshcar, banian, or other servant, of whatever\r\n    denomination, of the collector, or relation or dependant of any such\r\n    servant, be allowed to farm lands, nor directly or indirectly to\r\n    hold a concern in any farm, nor to be security for any farmer; that\r\n    the collector be strictly enjoined to prevent such practices; and\r\n    that, if it shall be discovered that any one, _under a false name,\r\n    or any kind of collusion_, hath found means to evade this order, he\r\n    shall be subject to an heavy fine, proportionate to the amount of\r\n    the farm, and the farm shall be re-let, or made _khas_: and if it\r\n    shall appear that the collector shall have countenanced, approved,\r\n    or connived at a breach of this regulation, he shall stand _ipso\r\n    facto_ dismissed from his collectorship. Neither shall any European,\r\n    directly or indirectly, be permitted to rent lands in any part of\r\n    the country.\"\r\n\r\n    _Remark by the Board._\r\n\r\n    17th. \"If the collector, or any persons who partake of his\r\n    authority, are permitted to be the farmers of the country, no other\r\n    persons will dare to be their competitors: of course they will\r\n    obtain the farms on their own terms. _It is not fit that the\r\n    servants of the Company should be dealers with their masters._ The\r\n    collectors are checks on the farmers. If they themselves turn\r\n    farmers, what checks can be found for _them_? What security will the\r\n    Company have for their property, or where are the ryots to look for\r\n    relief against oppressions?\"\r\n\r\nThe reasons assigned for the preceding regulation seem to your Committee\r\nto be perfectly just; but they can by no means be reconciled to those\r\nwhich induced Mr. Barwell to engage in the salt farms of Selimabad and\r\nSavagepoor. In the first place, his doing so is at length a direct and\r\navowed, though at first a covert, violation of the public regulation, to\r\nwhich he was himself a party as a member of the government, as well as\r\nan act of disobedience to the Company's positive orders on this subject.\r\nIn their General Letter of the 17th May, 1766, the Court of Directors\r\nsay, \"We positively order, that no covenanted servant, or Englishman\r\nresiding under our protection, shall be suffered to hold any land for\r\nhis own account, directly or indirectly, in his own name or that of\r\nothers, or to be concerned in any farms or revenues whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, if, instead of letting the Company's lands or farms to\r\nindifferent persons, their agent or trustee be at liberty to hold them\r\nhimself, he will always (on principles stated and adhered to in the\r\ndefence) have a sufficient reason for farming them on his own account,\r\nsince he can at all times make them as profitable as he pleases; or if\r\nhe leases them to a third person, yet reserves an intermediate profit\r\nfor himself, that profit may be as great as he thinks fit, and must be\r\nnecessarily made at the Company's expense. If at the same time he be\r\ncollector of the revenues, it will be his interest to recommend\r\nremissions in favor of the nominal farmer, and he will have it in his\r\npower to sink the amount of his collections.\r\n\r\nThese principles, and the correspondent practices, leave the India\r\nCompany without any security that all the leases of the lands of Bengal\r\nmay not have been disposed of, under that administration which made the\r\nfive years' settlement in 1772, in the same manner and for the same\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nTo enable the House to judge how far this apprehension may be founded,\r\nit will be proper to state, that Mr. Nicholas Grueber, who preceded Mr.\r\nBarwell in the Chiefship of Dacca, in a letter dated 29th of April,\r\n1775, declares that he paid to the Committee of Circuit twelve thousand\r\nrupees as their profit on a single salt farm,--which sum, he says, \"I\r\npaid the Committee at their request, before their departure from Dacca,\r\nand reimbursed myself out of _the advances_ directed to be issued for\r\nthe provision of the salt.\" Thus one illicit and mischievous transaction\r\nalways leads to another; and the irregular farming of revenue brings on\r\nthe misapplication of the commercial advances.\r\n\r\nMr. Barwell professes himself to be sensible \"_that a wish to add to his\r\nfortune may possibly have warped his judgment_, and that _he rather\r\nchooses to admit an error than deny a fact_.\" But your Committee are of\r\nopinion that the extraordinary caution and the intricate contrivances\r\nwith which his share in this transaction is wrapped up form a sufficient\r\nproof that he was not altogether misled in his judgment; and though\r\nthere might be some merit in acknowledging an error before it was\r\ndiscovered, there could be very little in a confession produced by\r\nprevious detection.\r\n\r\nThe reasons assigned by Mr. Barwell, in defence of the clandestine part\r\nof this transaction, seem to your Committee to be insufficient in\r\nthemselves, and not very fit to be urged by a man in his station. In one\r\nplace he says, that \"_it was not thought consistent with the public\r\nregulations that the names of any Europeans should appear_.\" In another\r\nhe says, \"I am aware of the objection that has been made to the English\r\ntaking farms under the names of natives, as prohibited by the Company's\r\norders; and I must _deviate_ a little upon this. It has been generally\r\nunderstood that the scope and tendency of the Honorable Company's\r\nprohibition of farms to Europeans was meant only to exclude such as\r\ncould not possibly, in their own persons, come under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Duanné courts of Adawlet, because, upon any failure of engagements,\r\nupon any complaint of unjust oppression, or other cause of discontent\r\nwhatever, it was supposed an European might screen himself from the\r\nprocess of the country judicature. But it was never supposed _that an\r\nEuropean of credit and responsibility_ was absolutely incapable from\r\nholding certain tenures under the sanction and authority of the country\r\nlaws, or from becoming security for such native farmers, contractors,\r\n&c., &c., as he might protect and employ.\"\r\n\r\nYour Committee have opposed this construction of Mr. Barwell's to the\r\npositive order which the conduct it is meant to color has violated.\r\n\"Europeans of credit and responsibility,\" that is, Europeans armed with\r\nwealth and power, and exercising offices of authority and trust, instead\r\nof being excepted from the spirit of the restriction, must be supposed\r\nthe persons who are chiefly meant to be comprehended in it; for abstract\r\nthe idea of an European from the ideas of power and influence, and the\r\nrestriction is no longer rational.\r\n\r\nYour Committee are therefore of opinion that the nature of the evil\r\nwhich was meant to be prevented by the above orders and regulations was\r\nnot altered, or the evil itself diminished, by the collusive methods\r\nmade use of to evade them,--and that, if the regulations were proper,\r\n(as they unquestionably were,) they ought to have been punctually\r\ncomplied with, particularly by the members of the government, _who\r\nformed the plan_, and who, as trustees of the Company, were especially\r\nanswerable for their being duly carried into execution. Your Committee\r\nhave no reason to believe that it could ever have been generally\r\nunderstood \"that the Company's prohibition of farms to Europeans was\r\nmeant only to exclude such as could not possibly, in their own persons,\r\ncome under the jurisdiction of the Duanné courts\": no such restriction\r\nis so much as hinted at. And if it had been so understood, Mr. Barwell\r\nwas one of the persons who, from their rank, station, and influence,\r\nmust have been the principal objects of the prohibition. Since the\r\nestablishment of the Company's influence in Bengal, no Europeans, of any\r\nrank whatever, have been subject to the process of the country\r\njudicature; and whether they act avowedly for themselves, and take farms\r\nin their own name, or substitute native Indians to act for them, the\r\ndifference is not material. The same influence that screened an European\r\nfrom the jurisdiction of the country courts would have equally protected\r\nhis native agent and representative. For many years past the Company's\r\nservants have presided in those courts, and in comparison with _their_\r\nauthority the native authority is nothing.\r\n\r\nThe earliest instructions that appear to have been given by the Court of\r\nDirectors in consequence of these transactions in Bengal are dated the\r\n5th of February, 1777. In their letter of that date they applaud the\r\nproceedings of the board, meaning the majority, (then consisting of\r\nGeneral Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr. Francis,) _as highly\r\nmeritorious_, and promise them their _firmest support_. \"Some of the\r\n_cases_\" they say, \"_are so flagrantly corrupt, and others attended with\r\ncircumstances so oppressive to the inhabitants, that it would be unjust\r\nto suffer the delinquents to go unpunished_.\" With this observation\r\ntheir proceedings appear to have ended, and paused for more than a year.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1778, the Directors appear to have resumed the\r\nsubject. In their letter of that date they instructed the Governor and\r\nCouncil forthwith to commence a prosecution in the Supreme Court of\r\nJudicature against the persons who composed the Committee of Circuit, or\r\ntheir representatives, and also against Mr. Barwell, in order to\r\nrecover, for the use of the Company, the amount of all advantages\r\nacquired by them from their several engagements in salt contracts and\r\nfarms. Adverting, however, to the declaration made by Mr. Barwell, that\r\nhe would account to the Court of Directors for the last shilling he had\r\nreceived and abide implicity by their judgment, they thought it\r\nprobable, that, on being acquainted with their peremptory orders for\r\ncommencing a prosecution, he might be desirous of paying his share of\r\nprofits into the Company's treasury; and they pointed out a precaution\r\nto be used in accepting such a tender on his part.\r\n\r\nOn this part of the transaction your Committee observe, that the Court\r\nof Directors appear blamable in having delayed till February, 1777, to\r\ntake any measure in consequence of advices so interesting and important,\r\nand on a matter concerning which they had made so strong a\r\ndeclaration,--considering that early in April, 1776, they say \"they had\r\ninvestigated the charges, and had then come to certain resolutions\r\nconcerning them.\" But their delaying to send out positive orders for\r\ncommencing a prosecution against the parties concerned till March, 1778,\r\ncannot be accounted for. In the former letter they promise, if they\r\nshould find it necessary, to return the original covenants of such of\r\ntheir servants as had been any ways concerned in the undue receipt of\r\nmoney, in order to enable the Governor-General and Council to recover\r\nthe same by suits in the Supreme Court. But your Committee do not find\r\nthat the covenants were ever transmitted to Bengal. To whatever cause\r\nthese instances of neglect and delay may be attributed, they could not\r\nfail to create an opinion in Bengal that the Court of Directors were not\r\nheartily intent upon the execution of their own orders, and to\r\ndiscourage those members of government who were disposed to undertake so\r\ninvidious a duty.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these delays, even their first orders did not arrive\r\nin Bengal until some time after the death of Colonel Monson, when the\r\nwhole power of the board had devolved to Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell.\r\nWhen they sent what they call _their positive orders_, in March, 1778,\r\nthey had long been apprised of the death of Colonel Monson, and must\r\nhave been perfectly certain of the effect which that event would have on\r\nthe subsequent measures and proceedings of the Governor-General and\r\nCouncil. Their opinion of the principles of those gentlemen appears in\r\ntheir letter of the 28th of November, 1777, wherein they say \"they\r\ncannot but express their concern that the power of granting away their\r\nproperty in perpetuity should have devolved upon such persons.\"\r\n\r\nBut the conduct of the Court of Directors appears to be open to\r\nobjections of a nature still more serious and important. A recovery of\r\nthe amount of Mr. Barwell's profits seems to be the only purpose which\r\nthey even professed to have in view. But your Committee are of opinion\r\nthat to preserve the reputation and dignity of the government of Bengal\r\nwas a much more important object, and ought to have been their first\r\nconsideration. The prosecution was not the pursuit of mean and\r\nsubordinate persons, who might with safety to the public interest remain\r\nin their seats during such an inquiry into their conduct. It appears\r\nvery doubtful, whether, if there were grounds for such a prosecution, a\r\nproceeding in Great Britain were not more politic than one in Bengal.\r\nSuch a prosecution ought not to have been ordered by the Directors, but\r\nupon grounds that would have fully authorized the recall of the\r\ngentleman in question. This prosecution, supposing it to have been\r\nseriously undertaken, and to have succeeded, must have tended to weaken\r\nthe government, and to degrade it in the eyes of all India. On the other\r\nhand, to intrust a man, armed as he was with all the powers of his\r\nstation, and indeed of the government, with the conduct of a prosecution\r\nagainst himself, was altogether inconsistent and absurd. The same letter\r\nin which they give these orders exhibits an example which sets the\r\ninconsistency of their conduct in a stronger light, because the case is\r\nsomewhat of a similar nature, but infinitely less pressing in its\r\ncircumstances. Observing that the Board of Trade had commenced a\r\nprosecution against Mr. William Barton, a member of that board, for\r\nvarious acts of peculation committed by him, they say, \"We must be of\r\nopinion, that, as _prosecutions are actually carrying on against him by\r\nour Board of Trade_, he is, during such prosecution at least, an\r\nimproper person to hold a seat _at that board_; and therefore we direct\r\nthat he be suspended from the Company's service until our further\r\npleasure concerning him be known.\" The principle laid down in this\r\ninstruction, even before their own opinion concerning Mr. Barton's case\r\nwas declared, and merely on the prosecution of others, serves to render\r\ntheir conduct not very accountable in the case of Mr. Barwell. Mr.\r\nBarton was in a subordinate situation, and his remaining or not\r\nremaining in it was of little or no moment to the prosecution. Mr.\r\nBarton was but one of seven; whereas Mr. Barwell was one of four, and,\r\nwith the Governor-General, was in effect the Supreme Council.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of power and patronage in India, and during the\r\nrelations which are permitted to subsist between the judges, the\r\nprosecuting officers, and the Council-General, your Committee is very\r\ndoubtful whether the mode of prosecuting the highest members in the\r\nBengal government, before a court at Calcutta, could have been almost in\r\nany case advisable.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that particular persons, in high judicial and political\r\nsituations, may, by force of an unusual strain of virtue, be placed far\r\nabove the influence of those circumstances which in ordinary cases are\r\nknown to make an impression on the human mind. But your Committee,\r\nsensible that laws and public proceedings ought to be made for general\r\nsituations, and not for personal dispositions, are not inclined to have\r\nany confidence in the effect of criminal proceedings, where no means are\r\nprovided for preventing a mutual connection, by dependencies, agencies,\r\nand employments, between the parties who are to prosecute and to judge\r\nand those who are to be prosecuted and to be tried.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, in a former Report, have stated the consequences which\r\nthey apprehended from the dependency of the judges on the\r\nGovernor-General and Council of Bengal; and the House has entered into\r\ntheir ideas upon this subject. Since that time it appears that Sir\r\nElijah Impey has accepted of the guardianship of Mr. Barwell's children,\r\nand was the trustee for his affairs. There is no law to prevent this\r\nsort of connection, and it is possible that it might not at all affect\r\nthe mind of that judge, or (upon his account) indirectly influence the\r\nconduct of his brethren; but it must forcibly affect the minds of those\r\nwho have matter of complaint against government, and whose cause the\r\nCourt of Directors appear to espouse, in a country where the authority\r\nof the Court of Directors has seldom been exerted but to be despised,\r\nwhere the operation of laws is but very imperfectly understood, but\r\nwhere men are acute, sagacious, and even suspicious of the effect of all\r\npersonal connections. Their suspicions, though perhaps not rightly\r\napplied to every individual, will induce them to take indications from\r\nthe situations and connections of the prosecuting parties, as well as of\r\nthe judges. It cannot fail to be observed, that Mr. Naylor, the\r\nCompany's attorney, lived in Mr. Barwell's house; the late Mr. Bogle,\r\nthe Company's commissioner of lawsuits, owed his place to the patronage\r\nof Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell, by whom the office was created for him;\r\nand Sir John Day, the Company's advocate, who arrived in Bengal in\r\nFebruary, 1779, had not been four months in Calcutta, when Mr. Hastings,\r\nMr. Barwell, and Sir Eyre Coote doubled his salary, contrary to the\r\nopinion of Mr. Francis and Mr. Wheler.\r\n\r\nIf the Directors are known to devolve the whole cognizance of the\r\noffences charged on their servants so highly situated upon the Supreme\r\nCourt, an excuse will be furnished, if already it has not been\r\nfurnished, to the Directors for declining the use of their own proper\r\npolitical power and authority in examining into and animadverting on the\r\nconduct of their servants. Their true character, as strict masters and\r\nvigilant governors, will merge in that of prosecutors. Their force and\r\nenergy will evaporate in tedious and intricate processes,--in lawsuits\r\nwhich can never end, and which are to be carried on by the very\r\ndependants of those who are under prosecution. On their part, these\r\nservants will decline giving satisfaction to their masters, because they\r\nare already before another tribunal; and thus, by shifting\r\nresponsibility from hand to hand, a confederacy to defeat the whole\r\nspirit of the law, and to remove all real restraints on their actions,\r\nmay be in time formed between the servants, Directors, prosecutors, and\r\ncourt. Of this great danger your Committee will take farther notice in\r\nanother place.\r\n\r\nNo notice whatever appears to have been taken of the Company's orders in\r\nBengal till the 11th of January, 1779, when Mr. Barwell moved, _that the\r\nclaim made upon him by the Court of Directors should be submitted to the\r\nCompany's lawyers, and that they should be perfectly instructed to\r\nprosecute upon it_. In his minute of that date he says, \"_that the state\r\nof his health had long since rendered it necessary for him to return to\r\nEurope_.\"\r\n\r\nYour Committee observe that he continued in Bengal another year. He\r\nsays, \"that he had hitherto waited for the arrival of Sir John Day, the\r\nCompany's advocate; but as the season was now far advanced, he wished to\r\nbring the trial speedily to issue.\"\r\n\r\nIn this minute he retracts his original engagement to submit himself to\r\nthe judgment of the Court of Directors, \"and to account to them for the\r\nlast shilling he had received\": he says, \"that no merit had been given\r\nhim for the offer; that a most unjustifiable advantage had been\r\nattempted to be made of it, by first declining it and _descending to\r\nabuse_, and then giving orders upon it as if it had been rejected, when\r\ncalled upon by him in the person of his agent to bring home the charge\r\nof delinquency.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barwell's reflections on the proceedings of the Court of Directors\r\nare not altogether clearly expressed; nor does it appear distinctly to\r\nwhat facts he alludes. He asserts that a most unjustifiable advantage\r\nhad been attempted to be made of his offer. The fact is, the Court of\r\nDirectors have nowhere declined accepting it; on the contrary, they\r\ncaution the Governor-General and Council about the manner of receiving\r\nthe tender of the money which they expect him to make. They say nothing\r\nof any call made on them by Mr. Barwell's agent in England; nor does it\r\nappear to your Committee that they \"have descended to abuse.\" They have\r\na right, and it is their duty, to express, in distinct and appropriated\r\nterms, their sense of all blamable conduct in their servants.\r\n\r\nSo far as may be collected from the evidence of the Company's records,\r\nMr. Barwell's assertions do not appear well supported; but even if they\r\nwere more plausible, your Committee apprehend that he could not be\r\ndischarged from his solemn recorded promise to abide by the judgment of\r\nthe Court of Directors. Their judgment was declared by their resolution\r\nto prosecute, which it depended upon himself to satisfy by making good\r\nhis engagement. To excuse his not complying with the Company's claims,\r\nhe says, \"_that his compliance would be urged as a confession of\r\ndelinquency, and to proceed from conviction of his having usurped on the\r\nrights of the Company_.\" Considerations of this nature might properly\r\nhave induced Mr. Barwell to stand upon his right in the first instance,\r\n\"_and to appeal_\" (to use his own words) \"_to the laws of his country,\r\nin order to vindicate his fame_.\" But his performance could not have\r\nmore weight to infer delinquency than his promise. Your Committee think\r\nhis observation comes too late.\r\n\r\nIf he had stood a trial, when he first acknowledged the facts, and\r\nsubmitted himself to the judgment of the Court of Directors, the suit\r\nwould have been carried on under the direction of General Clavering,\r\nColonel Monson, and Mr. Francis; whereas in the year 1779 his influence\r\nat the board gave him the conduct of it himself. In an interval of four\r\nyears it may be presumed that great alterations might have happened in\r\nthe state of the evidence against him.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent proceedings of the Governor-General and Council the\r\nHouse will find that Mr. Barwell complained that his instances for\r\ncarrying on the prosecution were ineffectual, owing to the legal\r\ndifficulties and delays _urged by the Company's law officers_, which\r\nyour Committee do not find have yet been removed. As far as the latest\r\nadvices reach, no progress appears to have been made in the business. In\r\nJuly, 1782, the Court of Directors found it necessary to order an\r\naccount of all suits against Europeans depending in the Supreme Court of\r\nJudicature to be transmitted to them, and that no time should be lost in\r\nbringing them to a determination.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALTPETRE.\r\n\r\nThe next article of direct monopoly subservient to the Company's export\r\nis saltpetre. This, as well as opium, is far the greater part the\r\nproduce of the province of Bahar. The difference between the management\r\nand destination of the two articles has been this. Until the year 1782,\r\nthe opium has been sold in the country, and the produce of the sale laid\r\nout in country merchandise for the Company's export. A great part of the\r\nsaltpetre is sent out in kind, and never has contributed to the interior\r\ncirculation and commerce of Bengal. It is managed by agency on the\r\nCompany's account. The price paid to the manufacturer is invariable.\r\nSome of the larger undertakers receive advances to enable them to\r\nprosecute their work; but as they are not always equally careful or\r\nfortunate, it happens that large balances accumulate against them.\r\nOrders have been sent from Calcutta from time to time to recover their\r\nbalances, with little or no success, but with great vexation to all\r\nconcerned in the manufacture. Sometimes they have imprisoned the failing\r\ncontractors in their own houses,--a severity which answers no useful\r\npurpose. Such persons are so many hands detached from the improvement\r\nand added to the burden of the country. They are persons of skill drawn\r\nfrom the future supply of that monopoly in favor of which they are\r\nprosecuted. In case of the death of the debtor, this rigorous demand\r\nfalls upon the ruined houses of widows and orphans, and may be easily\r\nconverted into a means either of cruel oppression or a mercenary\r\nindulgence, according to the temper of the exactors. Instead of thus\r\nhaving recourse to imprisonment, the old balance is sometimes deducted\r\nfrom the current produce. This, in these circumstances, is a grievous\r\ndiscouragement. People must be discouraged from entering into a\r\nbusiness, when, the commodity being fixed to one invariable standard and\r\nconfined to one market, the best success can be attended only with a\r\nlimited advantage, whilst a defective produce can never be compensated\r\nby an augmented price. Accordingly, very little of these advances has\r\nbeen recovered, and after much vexation the pursuit has generally been\r\nabandoned. It is plain that there can be no life and vigor in any\r\nbusiness under a monopoly so constituted; nor can the true productive\r\nresources of the country, in so large an article of its commerce, ever\r\ncome to be fully known.\r\n\r\nThe supply for the Company's demand in England has rarely fallen short\r\nof two thousand tons, nor much exceeded two thousand five hundred. A\r\ndiscretionary allowance of this commodity has been made to the French,\r\nDutch, and Danes, who purchase their allotted shares at some small\r\nadvance on the Company's price. The supply destined for the London\r\nmarket is proportioned to the spare tonnage; and to accommodate that\r\ntonnage, the saltpetre is sometimes sent to Madras and sometimes even to\r\nBombay, and that not unfrequently in vessels expressly employed for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Law, Chief of Patna, being examined on the effect of that monopoly,\r\ndelivered his opinion, that with regard to the Company's _trade_ the\r\nmonopoly was advantageous, but as sovereigns of the country they must be\r\nlosers by it. These two capacities in the Company are found in perpetual\r\ncontradiction. But much doubt may arise whether this monopoly will be\r\nfound advantageous to the Company either in the one capacity or the\r\nother. The gross commodity monopolized for sale in London is procured\r\nfrom the revenues in Bengal; the certain is given for the hazardous. The\r\nloss of interest on the advances, sometimes the loss of the\r\nprincipal,--the expense of carriage from Patna to Calcutta,--the various\r\nloadings and unloadings, and insurance (which, though borne by the\r\nCompany, is still insurance),--the engagement for the Ordnance, limited\r\nin price, and irregular in payment,--the charge of agency and\r\nmanagement, through all its gradations and successions,--when all these\r\nare taken into consideration, it may be found that the gain of the\r\nCompany as traders will be far from compensating their loss as\r\nsovereigns. A body like the East India Company can scarcely, in any\r\ncircumstance, hope to carry on the details of such a business, from its\r\ncommencement to its conclusion, with any degree of success. In the\r\nsubjoined estimate of profit and loss, the value of the commodity is\r\nstated at its invoice price at Calcutta. But this affords no just\r\nestimate of the whole effect of a dealing, where the Company's charge\r\ncommences in the first rudiments of the manufacture, and not at the\r\npurchase at the place of sale and valuation: for they [there?] may be\r\nheavy losses on the value at which the saltpetre is estimated, when,\r\nshipped off on their account, without any appearance in the account; and\r\nthe inquiries of your Committee to find the charges on the saltpetre\r\nprevious to the shipping have been fruitless.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH GOVERNMENT IN INDIA.\r\n\r\nThe other link by which India is bound to Great Britain is the\r\ngovernment established there originally by the authority of the East\r\nIndia Company, and afterwards modified by Parliament by the acts of 1773\r\nand 1780. This system of government appears to your Committee to be at\r\nleast as much disordered, and as much perverted from every good purpose\r\nfor which lawful rule is established, as the trading system has been\r\nfrom every just principle of commerce. Your Committee, in tracing the\r\ncauses of this disorder through its effects, have first considered the\r\ngovernment as it is constituted and managed within itself, beginning\r\nwith its most essential and fundamental part, the order and discipline\r\nby which the supreme authority of this kingdom is maintained.\r\n\r\nThe British government in India being a subordinate and delegated power,\r\nit ought to be considered as a fundamental principle in such a system,\r\nthat it is to be preserved in the strictest obedience to the government\r\nat home. Administration in India, at an immense distance from the seat\r\nof the supreme authority,--intrusted with the most extensive\r\npowers,--liable to the greatest temptations,--possessing the amplest\r\nmeans of abuse,--ruling over a people guarded by no distinct or\r\nwell-ascertained privileges, whose language, manners, and radical\r\nprejudices render not only redress, but all complaint on their part, a\r\nmatter of extreme difficulty,--such an administration, it is evident,\r\nnever can be made subservient to the interests of Great Britain, or even\r\ntolerable to the natives, but by the strictest rigor in exacting\r\nobedience to the commands of the authority lawfully set over it.\r\n\r\nBut your Committee find that this principle has been for some years very\r\nlittle attended to. Before the passing the act of 1773, the professed\r\npurpose of which was to secure a better subordination in the Company's\r\nservants, such was the firmness with which the Court of Directors\r\nmaintained their authority, that they displaced Governor Cartier,\r\nconfessedly a meritorious servant, for disobedience of orders, although\r\nhis case was not a great deal more than a question by whom the orders\r\nwere to be obeyed.[12] Yet the Directors were so sensible of the\r\nnecessity of a punctual and literal obedience, that, conceiving their\r\norders went to the parties who were to obey, as well as to the act to be\r\ndone, they proceeded with a strictness that, in all cases except that of\r\ntheir peculiar government, might well be considered as rigorous. But in\r\nproportion as the necessity of enforcing obedience grew stronger and\r\nmore urgent, and in proportion to the magnitude and importance of the\r\nobjects affected by disobedience, this rigor has been relaxed. Acts of\r\ndisobedience have not only grown frequent, but systematic; and they have\r\nappeared in such instances, and are manifested in such a manner, as to\r\namount, in the Company's servants, to little less than absolute\r\nindependence, against which, on the part of the Directors, there is no\r\nstruggle, and hardly so much as a protest to preserve a claim.\r\n\r\nBefore your Committee proceed to offer to the House their remarks on the\r\nmost distinguished of these instances, the particulars of which they\r\nhave already reported, they deem it necessary to enter into some detail\r\nof a transaction equally extraordinary and important, though not yet\r\nbrought into the view of Parliament, which appears to have laid the\r\nfoundation of the principal abuses that ensued, as well as to have given\r\nstrength and encouragement to those that existed. To this transaction,\r\nand to the conclusions naturally deducible from it, your Committee\r\nattribute that general spirit of disobedience and independence which has\r\nsince prevailed in the government of Bengal.\r\n\r\nYour Committee find that in the year 1775 Mr. Lauchlan Macleane was sent\r\ninto England as agent to the Nabob of Arcot and to Mr. Hastings. The\r\nconduct of Mr. Hastings, in assisting to extirpate, for a sum of money\r\nto be paid to the Company, the innocent nation of the Rohillas, had\r\ndrawn upon him the censure of the Court of Directors, and the unanimous\r\ncensure of the Court of Proprietors. The former had even resolved to\r\nprepare an application to his Majesty for Mr. Hastings's dismission.\r\n\r\nAnother General Court was called on this proceeding. Mr. Hastings was\r\nthen openly supported by a majority of the Court of Proprietors, who\r\nprofessed to entertain a good opinion of his general ability and\r\nrectitude of intention, notwithstanding the unanimous censure passed\r\nupon him. In that censure they therefore seemed disposed to acquiesce,\r\nwithout pushing the matter farther. But, as the offence was far from\r\ntrifling, and the condemnation of the measure recent, they did not\r\ndirectly attack the resolution of the Directors to apply to his Majesty,\r\nbut voted in the ballot that it should be reconsidered. The business\r\ntherefore remained in suspense, or it rather seemed to be dropped, for\r\nsome months, when Mr. Macleane took a step of a nature not in the least\r\nto be expected from the condition in which the cause of his principal\r\nstood, which was apparently as favorable as the circumstances could\r\nbear. Hitherto the support of Mr. Hastings in the General Court was only\r\nby a majority; but if on application from the Directors he should be\r\nremoved, a mere majority would not have been sufficient for his\r\nrestoration. The door would have been barred against his return to the\r\nCompany's service by one of the strongest and most substantial clauses\r\nin the Regulating Act of 1778. Mr. Macleane, probably to prevent the\r\nmanifest ill consequences of such a step, came forward with a letter to\r\nthe Court of Directors, declaring his provisional powers, and offering\r\non the part of Mr. Hastings an immediate resignation of his office.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion the Directors showed themselves extremely punctilious\r\nwith regard to Mr. Macleane's powers. They probably dreaded the charge\r\nof becoming accomplices to an evasion of the act by which Mr. Hastings,\r\nresigning the service, would escape the consequences attached by law to\r\na dismission; they therefore demanded Mr. Macleane's written authority.\r\nThis he declared he could not give into their hands, as the letter\r\ncontained other matters, of a nature extremely confidential, but that,\r\nif they would appoint a committee of the Directors, he would readily\r\ncommunicate to them the necessary parts of the letter, and give them\r\nperfect satisfaction with regard to his authority. A deputation was\r\naccordingly named, who reported that they had seen Mr. Hastings's\r\ninstructions, contained in a paper in _his own handwriting_, and that\r\nthe authority for the act now done by Mr. Macleane was clear and\r\nsufficient. Mr. Vansittart, a very particular friend of Mr. Hastings,\r\nand Mr. John Stewart, his most attached and confidential dependant,\r\nattended on this occasion, and proved that directions perfectly\r\ncorrespondent to this written authority had been given by Mr. Hastings\r\nin their presence. By this means the powers were fully authenticated;\r\nbut the letter remained safe in Mr. Macleane's hands.\r\n\r\nNothing being now wanting to the satisfaction of the Directors, the\r\nresignation was formally accepted. Mr. Wheler was named to fill the\r\nvacancy, and presented for his Majesty's approbation, which was\r\nreceived. The act was complete, and the office that Mr. Hastings had\r\nresigned was legally filled. This proceeding was officially notified in\r\nBengal, and General Clavering, as senior in Council, was in course to\r\nsucceed to the office of Governor-General.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, to extricate himself from the difficulties into which this\r\nresignation had brought him, had recourse to one of those unlooked-for\r\nand hardy measures which characterize the whole of his administration.\r\nHe came to a resolution of disowning his agent, denying his letter, and\r\ndisavowing his friends. He insisted on continuing in the execution of\r\nhis office, and supported himself by such reasons as could be furnished\r\nin such a cause. An open schism instantly divided the Council. General\r\nClavering claimed the office to which he ought to succeed, and Mr.\r\nFrancis adhered to him: Mr. Barwell stuck to Mr. Hastings. The two\r\nparties assembled separately, and everything was running fast into a\r\nconfusion which suspended government, and might very probably have ended\r\nin a civil war, had not the judges of the Supreme Court, on a reference\r\nto them, settled the controversy by deciding that the resignation was an\r\ninvalid act, and that Mr. Hastings was still in the legal possession of\r\nhis place, which had been actually filled up in England. It was\r\nextraordinary that the nullity of this resignation should not have been\r\ndiscovered in England, where the act authorizing the resignation then\r\nwas, where the agent was personally present, where the witnesses were\r\nexamined, and where there was and could be no want of legal advice,\r\neither on the part of the Company or of the crown. The judges took no\r\nlight matter upon them in superseding, and thereby condemning the\r\nlegality of his Majesty's appointment: for such it became by the royal\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nOn this determination, such as it was, the division in the meeting, but\r\nnot in the minds of the Council, ceased. General Clavering uniformly\r\nopposed the conduct of Mr. Hastings to the end of his life. But Mr.\r\nHastings showed more temper under much greater provocations. In\r\ndisclaiming his agent, and in effect accusing him of an imposture the\r\nmost deeply injurious to his character and fortune, and of the grossest\r\nforgery to support it, he was so very mild and indulgent as not to show\r\nany active resentment against his unfaithful agent, nor to complain to\r\nthe Court of Directors. It was expected in Bengal that some strong\r\nmeasures would have immediately been taken to preserve the just rights\r\nof the king and of the Court of Directors; as this proceeding,\r\nunaccompanied with the severest animadversion, manifestly struck a\r\ndecisive blow at the existence of the most essential powers of both. But\r\nyour Committee do not find that any measures whatever, such as the case\r\nseemed to demand, were taken. The observations made by the Court of\r\nDirectors on what they call \"_these extraordinary transactions_\" are\r\njust and well applied. They conclude with a declaration, \"_that the\r\nmeasures which it might be necessary for them to take, in order to\r\nretrieve the honor of the Company, and to prevent the like abuse from\r\nbeing practised in future, should have their most serious and earliest\r\nconsideration_\"; and with this declaration they appear to have closed\r\nthe account, and to have dismissed the subject forever.\r\n\r\nA sanction was hereby given to all future defiance of every authority in\r\nthis kingdom. Several other matters of complaint against Mr. Hastings,\r\nparticularly the charge of peculation, fell to the ground at the same\r\ntime. Opinions of counsel had been taken relative to a prosecution at\r\nlaw upon this charge, from the then Attorney and the then\r\nSolicitor-General and Mr. Dunning, (now the Lords Thurlow, Loughborough,\r\nand Ashburton,) together with Mr. Adair (now Recorder of London). None\r\nof them gave a positive opinion against the grounds of the prosecution.\r\nThe Attorney-General doubted on _the prudence_ of the proceedings, and\r\ncensured (as it well deserved) the ill statement of the case. Three of\r\nthem, Mr. Wedderburn, Mr. Dunning, and Mr. Adair, were clear in favor of\r\nthe prosecution. No prosecution, however, was had, and the Directors\r\ncontented themselves with censuring and admonishing Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Supreme Council, the members who chose (for it was\r\nchoice only) to attend to the orders which were issued from the\r\nlanguishing authority of the Directors continued to receive unprofitable\r\napplauses and no support. Their correspondence was always filled with\r\ncomplaints, the justice of which was always admitted by the Court of\r\nDirectors; but this admission of the existence of the evil showed only\r\nthe impotence of those who were to administer the remedy. The authority\r\nof the Court of Directors, resisted with success in so capital an\r\ninstance as that of the resignation, was not likely to be respected in\r\nany other. What influence it really had on the conduct of the Company's\r\nservants may be collected from the facts that followed it.\r\n\r\nThe disobedience of Mr. Hastings has of late not only become uniform and\r\nsystematical in practice, but has been in principle, also, supported by\r\nhim, and by Mr. Barwell, late a member of the Supreme Council in Bengal,\r\nand now a member of this House.\r\n\r\nIn the Consultation of the 20th of July, 1778, Mr. Barwell gives it as\r\nhis solemn and deliberate opinion, that, \"while Mr. Hastings is in the\r\ngovernment, the respect and dignity of his station should be supported.\r\nIn these sentiments, I must decline an acquiescence in _any_ order which\r\nhas a _tendency_ to bring the government into disrepute. As the Company\r\nhave the means and power of forming their own administration in India,\r\nthey may at pleasure place whom they please at the head; but in my\r\nopinion they are not authorized to treat a person in that post with\r\n_indignity_.\"\r\n\r\nBy treating them with indignity (in the particular cases wherein they\r\nhave declined obedience to orders) they must mean those orders which\r\nimply a censure on any part of their conduct, a reversal of any of their\r\nproceedings, or, as Mr. Barwell expresses himself in words very\r\nsignificant, in any orders that have a _tendency_ to bring _their_\r\ngovernment into _disrepute_. The amplitude of this latter description,\r\nreserving to them the judgment of any orders which have so much as that\r\n_tendency_, puts them in possession of a complete independence, an\r\nindependence including a despotic authority over the subordinates and\r\nthe country. The very means taken by the Directors for enforcing their\r\nauthority becomes, on this principle, a cause of further disobedience.\r\nIt is observable, that their principles of disobedience do not refer to\r\nany local consideration, overlooked by the Directors, which might\r\nsupersede their orders, or to any change of circumstances, which might\r\nrender another course advisable, or even perhaps necessary,--but it\r\nrelates solely to their own interior feelings in matters relative to\r\nthemselves, and their opinion of their own dignity and reputation. It is\r\nplain that they have wholly forgotten who they are, and what the nature\r\nof their office is. Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell are servants of the\r\nCompany, and as such, by the duty inherent in that relation, as well as\r\nby their special covenants, were obliged to yield obedience to the\r\norders of their masters. They have, as far as they were able, cancelled\r\nall the bonds of this relation, and all the sanctions of these\r\ncovenants.\r\n\r\nBut in thus throwing off the authority of the Court of Directors, Mr.\r\nHastings and Mr. Barwell have thrown off the authority of the whole\r\nlegislative power of Great Britain; for, by the Regulating Act of the\r\nthirteenth of his Majesty, they are expressly \"directed and required to\r\npay due obedience to _all_ such orders as they shall receive from the\r\nCourt of Directors of the said United Company.\" Such is the declaration\r\nof the law. But Mr. Barwell declares that he declines obedience to _any_\r\norders which he shall interpret to be indignities on a Governor-General.\r\nTo the clear injunctions of the legislature Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell\r\nhave thought proper to oppose their pretended reputation and dignity; as\r\nif the chief honor of public ministers in every situation was not to\r\nyield a cheerful obedience to the laws of their country. Your Committee,\r\nto render evident to this House the general nature and tendency of this\r\npretended dignity, and to illustrate the real principles upon which they\r\nappear to have acted, think it necessary to make observations on three\r\nor four of the cases, already reported, of marked disobedience to\r\nparticular and special orders, on one of which the above extraordinary\r\ndoctrine was maintained.\r\n\r\nThese are the cases of Mr. Fowke, Mr. Bristow, and Mahomed Reza Khân. In\r\na few weeks after the death of Colonel Monson, Mr. Hastings having\r\nobtained a majority in Council by his casting vote, Mr. Fowke and Mr.\r\nBristow were called from their respective offices of Residents at\r\nBenares and Oude, places which have become the scenes of other\r\nextraordinary operations under the conduct of Mr. Hastings in person.\r\nFor the recall of Mr. Bristow no reason was assigned. The reason\r\nassigned for the proceeding with regard to Mr. Fowke was, that \"the\r\npurposes for which he was appointed were then fully accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nAn account of the removal of Mr. Fowke was communicated to the Court of\r\nDirectors in a letter of the 22d of December, 1776. On this\r\nnotification the Court had nothing to conclude, but that Mr. Hastings,\r\nfrom a rigid pursuit of economy in the management of the Company's\r\naffairs, had recalled a useless officer. But, without alleging any\r\nvariation whatsoever in the circumstances, in less than twenty days\r\nafter the order for the recall of Mr. Fowke, and _the very day after the\r\ndispatch_ containing an account of the transaction, Mr. Hastings\r\nrecommended Mr. Graham to this very office, the end of which, he\r\ndeclared to the Directors but the day before, had been fully\r\naccomplished; and not thinking this sufficient, he appointed Mr. D.\r\nBarwell as his assistant, at a salary of about four hundred pounds a\r\nyear. Against this extraordinary act General Clavering and Mr. Francis\r\nentered a protest.\r\n\r\nSo early as the 6th of the following January the appointment of these\r\ngentlemen was communicated in a letter to the Court of Directors,\r\nwithout any sort of color, apology, or explanation. That court found a\r\nservant removed from his station without complaint, contrary to the\r\ntenor of one of their standing injunctions. They allow, however, and\r\nwith reason, that, \"if it were possible to suppose that a saving, &c,\r\nhad been his motive, they would have approved his proceeding. But that\r\nwhen immediately afterwards two persons, with _two_ salaries, had been\r\nappointed to execute the office which had been filled with reputation by\r\nMr. Fowke alone, and that Mr. Graham enjoys all the emoluments annexed\r\nto the office of Mr. Fowke,\"--they properly conclude that Mr. Fowke was\r\nremoved without just cause, to make way for Mr. Graham, and strictly\r\nenjoin that the former be reinstated in his office of Resident as\r\nPost-master of Benares. In the same letter they assert their rights in\r\na tone of becoming firmness, and declare, that \"on no account we can\r\npermit our orders to be disobeyed or our authority disregarded.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now to be seen which of the parties was to give way. The orders\r\nwere clear and precise, and enforced by a strong declaration of the\r\nresolution of the Court to make itself obeyed. Mr. Hastings fairly\r\njoined issue upon this point with his masters, and, having disobeyed the\r\ngeneral instructions of the Company, determined to pay no obedience to\r\ntheir special order.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st July, 1778, he moved, and succeeded in his proposition, that\r\nthe execution of these orders should be suspended. The reason he\r\nassigned for this suspension lets in great light upon the true character\r\nof all these proceedings: \"That his consent to the recall of Mr. Graham\r\nwould be adequate to his own resignation of the service, as it would\r\ninflict such a wound on _his authority and influence_ that he could not\r\nmaintain it.\"\r\n\r\nIf that had been his opinion, he ought to have resigned, and not\r\ndisobeyed: because it was not necessary that he should hold his office;\r\nbut it was necessary, that, whilst he hold it, he should obey his\r\nsuperiors, and submit to the law. Much more truly was his conduct a\r\nvirtual resignation of his lawful office, and at the same time an\r\nusurpation of a situation which did not belong to him, to hold a\r\nsubordinate office, and to refuse to act according to its duties. Had\r\nhis authority been self-originated, it would have been wounded by his\r\nsubmission; but in this case the true nature of his authority was\r\naffirmed, not injured, by his obedience, because it was a power derived\r\nfrom others, and, by its essence, to be executed according to their\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nIn this determined disobedience he was supported by Mr. Barwell, who on\r\nthat occasion delivered the dangerous doctrine to which your Committee\r\nhave lately adverted. Mr. Fowke, who had a most material interest in\r\nthis determination, applied by letter to be informed concerning it. An\r\nanswer was sent, acquainting him coldly, and without any reason\r\nassigned, of what had been resolved relative to his office. This\r\ncommunication was soon followed by another letter from Mr. Fowke, with\r\ngreat submission and remarkable decency asserting his right to his\r\noffice under the authority of the Court of Directors, and for solid\r\nreasons, grounded on the Company's express orders, praying to be\r\ninformed of the charge against him. This letter appears to have been\r\nreceived by Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell very loftily. Mr. Hastings\r\nsaid, \"that such applications were irregular; that they are not\r\naccountable to Mr. Fowke for their resolution respecting him. The\r\nreasons for suspending the execution of the orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors contain _no charge, nor the slightest imputation of a charge_,\r\nagainst Mr. Fowke; _but I see no reason why the board should condescend\r\nto tell him so_.\" Accordingly, the proposition of Mr. Francis and Mr.\r\nWheler, to inform Mr. Fowke \"that they had no reason to be dissatisfied\r\nwith his conduct,\" on the previous question was rejected.\r\n\r\nBy this resolution Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell discovered another\r\nprinciple, and no less dangerous than the first: namely, that persons\r\nderiving a valuable interest under the Company's orders, so far from\r\nbeing heard in favor of their right, are not so much as to be informed\r\nof the grounds on which they are deprived of it.\r\n\r\nThe arrival soon after of Sir Eyre Coote giving another opportunity of\r\ntrial, the question for obedience to the Company's orders was again[13]\r\nbrought on by Mr. Francis, and again received a negative. Sir Eyre\r\nCoote, though present, and declaring, that, had he been at the original\r\nconsultation, he should have voted for the immediate execution of the\r\nCompany's orders, yet he was resolved to avoid what he called _any kind\r\nof retrospect_. His neutrality gained the question in favor of this, the\r\nthird resolution for disobedience to orders.\r\n\r\nThe resolution in Bengal being thus decisively taken, it came to the\r\nturn of the Court of Directors to act their part. They did act their\r\npart exactly in their old manner: they had recourse to their old remedy\r\nof repeating orders which had been disobeyed. The Directors declare to\r\nMr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell, though without any apparent reason, that\r\n\"they have read _with astonishment their formal resolution_ to suspend\r\nthe execution of their orders; that they shall take such measures as\r\nappear necessary for _preserving the authority of the Court of\r\nDirectors_, and for preventing _such instances of direct and wilful_\r\ndisobedience in their servants in time to come.\" They then renew their\r\ndirections concerning Mr. Fowke. The event of this _sole_ measure taken\r\nto preserve their authority, and to prevent instances of direct and\r\nwilful disobedience, your Committee will state in its proper\r\nplace,--taking into consideration, for the present, the proceedings\r\nrelative to Mr. Bristow, and to Mahomed Reza Khân, which were\r\naltogether in the same spirit; but as they were diversified in the\r\ncircumstances of disobedience, as well from the case of Mr. Fowke as\r\nfrom one another, and as these circumstances tend to discover other\r\ndangerous principles of abuse, and the general prostrate condition of\r\nthe authority of Parliament in Bengal, your Committee proceed first to\r\nmake some observations upon them.\r\n\r\nThe province of Oude, enlarged by the accession of several extensive and\r\nonce flourishing territories, that is, by the country of the Rohillas,\r\nthe district of Corah and Allahabad, and other provinces betwixt the\r\nGanges and Jumna, is under the nominal dominion of one of the princes of\r\nthe country, called Asoph ul Dowlah. But a body of English troops is\r\nkept up in his country; and the greatest part of his revenues are, by\r\none description or another, substantially under the administration of\r\nEnglish subjects. He is to all purposes a dependent prince. The person\r\nto be employed in his dominions to act for the Committee [Company?] was\r\ntherefore of little consequence in his capacity of negotiator; but he\r\nwas vested with a trust, great and critical, in all pecuniary affairs.\r\nThese provinces of dependence lie out of the system of the Company's\r\nordinary administration, and transactions there cannot be so readily\r\nbrought under the cognizance of the Court of Directors. This renders it\r\nthe more necessary that the Residents in such places should be persons\r\nnot disapproved of by the Court of Directors. They are to manage a\r\npermanent interest, which is not, like a matter of political\r\nnegotiation, variable, and which, from circumstances, might possibly\r\nexcuse some degree of discretionary latitude in construing their orders.\r\nDuring the lifetime of General Clavering and Colonel Monson, Mr.\r\nBristow was appointed to this Presidency, and that appointment, being\r\napproved and confirmed by the Court of Directors, became in effect their\r\nown. Mr. Bristow appears to have shown himself a man of talents and\r\nactivity. He had been principally concerned in the negotiations by which\r\nthe Company's interest in the higher provinces had been established; and\r\nthose services were considered by the Presidency of Calcutta as so\r\nmeritorious, that they voted him ten thousand pounds as a reward, with\r\nmany expressions of esteem and honor.\r\n\r\nMr. Bristow, however, was recalled by Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell, who\r\nhad then acquired the majority, without any complaint having been\r\nassigned as the cause of his removal, and Mr. Middleton was sent in his\r\nstead to reside at the capital of Oude. The Court of Directors, as soon\r\nas they could be apprised of this extraordinary step, in their letter of\r\nthe 4th of July, 1777, express their strongest disapprobation of it:\r\nthey order Mr. Middleton to be recalled, and Mr. Bristow to be\r\nreinstated in his office. In December, 1778, they repeat their order. Of\r\nthese repeated orders no notice was taken. Mr. Bristow, fatigued with\r\nunsuccessful private applications, which met with a constant refusal,\r\ndid at length, on the 1st of May, 1780, address a letter to the board,\r\nmaking his claim of right, entitling himself to his offices [office?]\r\nunder the authority of the Court of Directors, and complaining of the\r\nhardships which he suffered by the delay in admitting him to the\r\nexercise of it. This letter your Committee have inserted at large in the\r\nFifth Report, having found nothing whatsoever exceptionable in it,\r\nalthough it seems to have excited the warmest resentment in Mr.\r\nHastings.\r\n\r\nThis claim of the party gave no new force to the order of the Directors,\r\nwhich remained without any attention from the board from Mr. Bristow's\r\narrival until the 1st of May, and with as little from the 1st of May to\r\nthe 2nd of October following. On that day, Mr. Francis, after having\r\ncaused the repeated orders of the Court of Directors to be first read,\r\nmoved that Mr. Bristow should be reinstated in his office. This motion,\r\nin itself just and proper in the highest degree, and in which no fault\r\ncould be found, but that it was not made more early, was received by Mr.\r\nHastings with the greatest marks of resentment and indignation. He\r\ndeclares in his minute, that, \"were the most determined adversary of the\r\nBritish nation to possess, by whatever means, a share in the\r\nadministration, he could not devise a measure in _itself_ so pernicious,\r\nor _time_ it so effectually for the _ruin_ of the British interests in\r\nIndia.\" Then turning to the object of the motion, he says, \"I will ask,\r\nWho is Mr. Bristow, that a member of the administration should, at such\r\na time, hold him forth, as _an instrument for the degradation of the\r\nfirst executive member of this government?_ What are the professed\r\nobjects of his appointment? What are the _merits_ and services, or what\r\nthe _qualifications_, which entitle him to such uncommon distinction? Is\r\nit for his superior _integrity_, or from his eminent _abilities_, that\r\nhe is to be dignified at such hazard of every consideration that ought\r\nto influence the members of this administration? Of the former (his\r\nintegrity) I know _no proofs_; I am sure it is not an evidence of it,\r\nthat he has been _enabled_ to make himself the principal in such a\r\n_competition:_ and for the test of his abilities I appeal to the letter\r\nwhich he has _dared_ to write to this board, and which I am ashamed to\r\nsay we have _suffered_. I desire that a copy of it may be inserted in\r\nthis day's proceedings, that it may stand before the eyes of every\r\nmember of the board, when he shall give his vote upon a question for\r\ngiving their confidence to a man, _their servant_, who has publicly\r\ninsulted _them, his masters_, and the members of the government to whom\r\nhe owes _his obedience_,--who, assuming an association with the Court of\r\nDirectors, and erecting himself into a _tribunal_, has _arraigned_ them\r\nfor _disobedience_ of orders, _passed judgment_ upon them, _and\r\ncondemned or acquitted them, as their magistrate or superior_. Let the\r\nboard consider, whether a man possessed of so _independent_ a spirit,\r\nwho has already shown a _contempt_ of their authority, who has shown\r\nhimself _so wretched an advocate for his own cause and negotiator for\r\nhis own interest_, is fit to be trusted with the guardianship of _their_\r\nhonor, the execution of _their_ measures, and as _their_ confidential\r\nmanager and negotiator with the princes of India. As the motion has been\r\nunaccompanied by any reasons which should induce the board to pass their\r\nacquiescence in it, I presume the motion which preceded it, for _reading\r\nthe orders of the Court of Directors, was intended to serve as an\r\nargument for it, as well as an introduction to it_. The last of those\r\nwas dictated the 23rd December, 1778, almost two years past. They were\r\ndictated at a time when, I am sorry to say, the Court of Directors were\r\nin _the habit of casting reproach upon my conduct and heaping\r\nindignities upon my station_.\"\r\n\r\nHad the language and opinions which prevail throughout this part of the\r\nminute, as well as in all the others to which your Committee refer, been\r\nuttered suddenly and in a passion, however unprovoked, some sort of\r\napology might be made for the Governor-General. But when it was produced\r\nfive months after the supposed offence, and then delivered in writing,\r\nwhich always implies the power of a greater degree of recollection and\r\nself-command, it shows how deeply the principles of disobedience had\r\ntaken root in his mind, and of an assumption to himself of exorbitant\r\npowers, which he chooses to distinguish by the title of \"_his\r\nprerogative_.\" In this also will be found an obscure hint of the cause\r\nof his disobedience, which your Committee conceive to allude to the main\r\ncause of the disorders in the government of India,--namely, an underhand\r\ncommunication with Europe.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, by his confidence in the support derived from this source,\r\nor from the habits of independent power, is carried to such a length as\r\nto consider a motion to obey the Court of Directors as a degradation of\r\nthe executive government in his person. He looks upon a claim under that\r\nauthority, and a complaint that it has produced no effect, as a piece of\r\ndaring insolence which he is ashamed that the board has suffered. The\r\nbehavior which your Committee consider as so intemperate and despotic he\r\nregards as a culpable degree of patience and forbearance. Major Scott,\r\nhis agent, enters so much into the principles of Mr. Hastings's conduct\r\nas to tell your Committee that in his opinion Lord Clive would have sent\r\nhome Mr. Bristow a prisoner upon such an occasion. It is worthy of\r\nremark, that, in the very same breath that Mr. Hastings so heavily\r\ncondemns a junior officer in the Company's service (not a _servant_ of\r\nthe Council, as he hazards to call him, but _their fellow-servant_) for\r\nmerely complaining of a supposed injury and requiring redress, he so far\r\nforgets his own subordination as to reject the orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors even as an _argument_ in favor of appointing a person to an\r\noffice, to presume to censure _his_ undoubted masters, and to accuse\r\nthem of having been \"in a habit of casting reproaches upon him, and\r\nheaping indignities on _his_ station.\" And it is to be observed, that\r\nthis censure was not for the purpose of seeking or obtaining redress for\r\nany injury, but appeared rather as a reason for refusing to obey their\r\nlawful commands. It is plainly implied in that minute, that no servant\r\nof the Company, in Mr. Bristow's rank, would dare to act in such a\r\nmanner, if he had not by indirect means obtained a premature fortune.\r\nThis alone is sufficient to show the situation of the Company's servants\r\nin the subordinate situations, when the mere claim of a right, derived\r\nfrom the sovereign legal power, becomes fatal not only to the objects\r\nwhich they pursue, but deeply wounds that reputation both for ability\r\nand integrity by which alone they are to be qualified for any other.\r\n\r\nIf anything could add to the disagreeable situation of those who are\r\nsubmitted to an authority conducted on such principles, it is this: The\r\nCompany has ordered that no complaint shall be made in Europe against\r\nany of the Council without being previously communicated to them: a\r\nregulation formed upon grave reasons; and it was certainly made in\r\n_favor_ of that board. But if a person, having ground of complaint\r\nagainst the Council, by making use of the mode prescribed in favor of\r\nthat very Council, and by complaining to themselves, commits an offence\r\nfor which he may be justly punished, the Directors have not regulated\r\nthe mode of complaint, they have actually forbidden it; they have, on\r\nthat supposition, renounced their authority; and the whole system of\r\ntheir officers is delivered over to the arbitrary will of a few of their\r\nchief servants.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole day of that deliberation things wore a decided face.\r\nMr. Hastings stood to his principles in their full extent, and seemed\r\nresolved upon unqualified disobedience. But as the debate was adjourned\r\nto the day following, time was given for expedients; and such an\r\nexpedient was hit upon by Mr. Hastings as will, no doubt, be unexpected\r\nby the House; but it serves to throw new lights upon the motives of all\r\nhis struggles with the authority of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Council met upon the adjournment. Then Mr. Hastings\r\nproposed, as a compromise, a division of the object in question. One\r\nhalf was to be surrendered to the authority of the Court of Directors,\r\nthe other was reserved for his dignity. But the choice he made of his\r\nown share in this partition is very worthy of notice. He had taken his\r\n_sole_ ground of objection against Mr. Bristow on the supposed ill\r\neffect that such an appointment would have on the minds of the Indian\r\npowers. He said, \"that these powers could have no dependence on his\r\nfulfilling his engagements, _or maintaining the faith of treaties_ which\r\nhe might offer for their acceptance, if they saw him treated with such\r\ncontempt.\" Mr. Bristow's appearing in a political character was the\r\n_whole_ of his complaint; yet, when he comes to a voluntary distribution\r\nof the duties of the office, he gives Mr. Bristow those very political\r\nnegotiations of which but the day before he had in such strong terms\r\ndeclared him personally incapable, whose appointment he considered to be\r\nfatal to those negotiations, and which he then spoke of as a measure in\r\n_itself_ such as the bitterest adversary to Great Britain would have\r\nproposed. But having thus yielded his whole ground of ostensible\r\nobjection, he reserved to his own appointment the entire management of\r\nthe pecuniary trust. Accordingly he named Mr. Bristow for the former,\r\nand Mr. Middleton for the latter. On his own principles he ought to have\r\ndone the very reverse. On every justifiable principle he ought to have\r\ndone so; for a servant who for a long time resists the orders of his\r\nmasters, and when he reluctantly gives way obeys them by halves, ought\r\nto be remarkably careful to make his actions correspond with his words,\r\nand to put himself out of all suspicion with regard to the purity of his\r\nmotives. It was possible that the political reasons, which were solely\r\nassigned against Mr. Bristow's appointment, might have been the real\r\nmotives of Mr. Hastings's opposition. But these he totally abandons, and\r\nholds fast to the pecuniary department. Now, as it is notorious that\r\nmost of the abuses of India grow out of money-dealing, it was peculiarly\r\nunfit for a servant, delicate with regard to his reputation, to require\r\na _personal_ and confidential agent in a situation merely official, in\r\nwhich secrecy and personal connections could be of no possible use, and\r\ncould only serve to excite distrust. Matters of account cannot be made\r\ntoo public; and it is not the most confidential agent, but the most\r\nresponsible, who is the fittest for the management of pecuniary trusts.\r\nThat man was the fittest at once to do the duty, and to remove all\r\nsuspicions from the Governor-General's character, whom, by not being of\r\nhis appointment, he could not be supposed to favor for private purposes,\r\nwho must naturally stand in awe of his inspection, and whose misconduct\r\ncould not possibly be imputable to him. Such an agency in a pecuniary\r\ntrust was the very last on which Mr. Hastings ought to have risked his\r\ndisobedience to the orders of the Direction,--or, what is even worse for\r\nhis motives, a direct contradiction to all the principles upon which he\r\nhad attempted to justify that bold measure.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Mr. Hastings in the affair of Mahomed Reza Khân was an\r\nact of disobedience of the same character, but wrought by other\r\ninstruments. When the Duanné (or universal perception, and management of\r\nthe revenues) of Bengal was acquired to the Company, together with the\r\ncommand of the army, the Nabob, or governor, naturally fell into the\r\nrank rather of a subject than that even of a dependent prince. Yet the\r\npreservation of such a power in such a degree of subordination, with the\r\ncriminal jurisdiction, and the care of the public order annexed to it,\r\nwas a wise and laudable policy. It preserved a portion of the government\r\nin the hands of the natives; it kept them in respect; it rendered them\r\nquiet on the change; and it prevented that vast kingdom from wearing the\r\ndangerous appearance, and still more from sinking into the terrible\r\nstate, of a country of conquest. Your Committee has already reported the\r\nmanner in which the Company (it must be allowed, upon pretences that\r\nwill not bear the slightest examination) diverted from its purposes a\r\ngreat part of the revenues appropriated to the country government; but\r\nthey were very properly anxious that what remained should be well\r\nadministered. In the lifetime of General Clavering and Colonel Monson,\r\nMahomed Reza Khân, a man of rank among the natives, was judged by them\r\nthe fittest person to conduct the affairs of the Nabob, as his Naib, or\r\ndeputy: an office well known in the ancient constitution of these\r\nprovinces, at a time when the principal magistrates, by nature and\r\nsituation, were more efficient. This appointment was highly approved,\r\nand in consequence confirmed, by the Court of Directors. Mr. Hastings\r\nand Mr. Barwell, however, thought proper to remove him. To the authority\r\nof the Court of Directors they opposed the request of the Nabob, stating\r\nthat he was arrived at the common age of maturity, and stood _in no need\r\nof a deputy to manage his affairs_. On former occasions Mr. Hastings\r\nconceived a very low opinion of the condition of the person whom he thus\r\nset up against the authority of his masters. \"On a former occasion,\" as\r\nthe Directors tell him, \"and to serve a very different purpose, he had\r\nnot scrupled to declare it as visible as the sun that the Nabob was a\r\nmere pageant, without even _the shadow of authority_.\" But on this\r\noccasion he became more substantial. Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell\r\nyielded to his representation that a deputy was not necessary, and\r\naccordingly Mahomed Reza Khân was removed from his office.\r\n\r\nHowever, lest any one should so far mistrust their understanding as to\r\nconceive them the dupes of this pretext, they who had disobeyed the\r\nCompany's orders under color that _no deputy was necessary_ immediately\r\nappoint another deputy. This independent prince, who, as Mr. Hastings\r\nsaid, \"had an incontestable right to his situation, and that it was his\r\nby inheritance,\" suddenly shrunk into his old state of insignificance,\r\nand was even looked upon in so low a light as to receive a severe\r\nreprimand from Mr. Hastings for _interposing_ in the duties of his (the\r\ndeputy's) office.\r\n\r\nThe Company's orders, censuring this transaction in the strongest terms,\r\nand ordering Mahomed Reza Khân to be immediately restored to the office\r\nof Naib Subahdar, were received in Calcutta in November, 1779. Mr.\r\nHastings acted on this with the firmness which he had shown on other\r\noccasions; but in his principles he went further. Thinking himself\r\nassured of some extraordinary support, suitable to the open and\r\ndetermined defiance with which he was resolved to oppose the lawful\r\nauthority of his superiors, and to exercise a despotic power, he no\r\nlonger adhered to Mr. Barwell's distinction of the orders which had a\r\ntendency to bring his government into disrepute. This distinction\r\nafforded sufficient latitude to disobedience; but here he disdained all\r\nsorts of colors and distinctions. He directly set up an independent\r\nright to administer the government according to his pleasure; and he\r\nwent so far as to bottom his claim to act independently of the Court of\r\nDirectors on the very statute which commanded his obedience to them.\r\n\r\nHe declared roundly, \"that he should _not_ yield to the authority of the\r\nCourt of Directors in _any_ instance in which it should require his\r\nconcession of the rights which he held under an act of Parliament.\" It\r\nis too clear to stand in need of proof, that he neither did or could\r\nhold any authority that was not subject, in every particle of it, and in\r\nevery instance in which it could be exercised, to the orders of the\r\nCourt of Directors.\r\n\r\nHe therefore refused to back the Company's orders with any requisition\r\nfrom himself to the Nabob, but merely suffered them to be transmitted to\r\nhim, leaving it to him to do just as he thought proper. The Nabob, who\r\ncalled Mr. Hastings \"his patron, and declared he would never do anything\r\nwithout his consent and approbation,\" perfectly understood this kind of\r\nsignification. For the second time the Nabob recovered from his trance\r\nof pageantry and insignificance, and collected courage enough to write\r\nto the Council in these terms: \"I administer the affairs of the Nizamut,\r\n(the government,) which are the affairs of _my own family_, by _my own\r\nauthority_, and shall do so; and I never can _on any account agree_ to\r\nthe appointment of the Nabob Mahomed Reza Khân to the Naib Subahship.\"\r\nHere was a second independent power in Bengal. This answer from that\r\npower proved as satisfactory as it was resolute. No further notice was\r\ntaken of the orders of the Court of Directors, and Mahomed Reza Khân\r\nfound their protection much more of a shadow than the pageant of power\r\nof which he aspired to be the representative.\r\n\r\nThis act of disobedience differs from the others in one particular\r\nwhich, in the opinion of your Committee, rather aggravates than\r\nextenuates the offence. In the others, Messrs. Hastings and Barwell took\r\nthe responsibility on themselves; here they held up the pretext of the\r\ncountry government. However, they obtained thereby one of the objects\r\nwhich they appear to have systematically pursued. As they had in the\r\nother instances shown to the British servants of the Company that the\r\nDirectors were not able to protect them, here the same lesson was taught\r\nto the natives. Whilst the matter lay between the native power and the\r\nservants, the former was considered by Mr. Hastings in the most\r\ncontemptible light. When the question was between the servants and the\r\nCourt of Directors, the native power was asserted to be a self-derived,\r\nhereditary, uncontrollable authority, and encouraged to act as such.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the authority of the British legislature was at that time\r\ntreated with every mark of reprobation and contempt. But soon after a\r\nmost unexpected change took place, by which the persons in whose favor\r\nthe Court of Directors had in vain interposed obtained specific objects\r\nwhich had been refused to them; things were, however, so well contrived,\r\nthat legal authority was nearly as much affronted by the apparent\r\ncompliance with their orders as by the real resistance they had before\r\nmet with. After long and violent controversies, an agreement took place\r\nbetween Mr. Hastings and Mr. Francis. It appears that Mr. Hastings,\r\nembarrassed with the complicated wars and ruinous expenses into which\r\nhis measures had brought him, began to think of procuring peace at home.\r\nThe agreement originated in a conversation held on Christmas-Day, 1779,\r\nbetween Major Scott, then aide-de-camp, and now agent, to Mr. Hastings,\r\nand Mr. Ducarrel, a gentleman high in the Company's service at Calcutta.\r\nMr. Scott, in consequence of this conversation, was authorized to make\r\novertures to Mr. Francis through Mr. Ducarrel: to declare Mr. Hastings\r\ntired of controversy; expressing his wish to have the Mahratta war\r\nentirely left to him; that there were certain points _he could not give\r\nup_; that he could _not_ (for reasons he then assigned) _submit_ to the\r\nrestoration of Mr. Fowke, Mahomed Reza Khân, and Mr. Bristow; that _he\r\nhad not the smallest personal objection to them_, and would willingly\r\nprovide for them in any other line. Mr. Francis in this treaty insisted\r\non those very points which Mr. Hastings declared he could never give up,\r\nand that his conditions were the Company's orders,--that is, the\r\nrestoration of the persons whom they had directed to be restored. The\r\nevent of this negotiation was, that Mr. Hastings at length submitted to\r\nMr. Francis, and that Mr. Fowke and Mahomed Reza Khân were reinstated in\r\ntheir situations.\r\n\r\nYour Committee observe on this part of the transaction of Mr. Hastings,\r\nthat as long as the question stood upon his obedience to his lawful\r\nsuperiors, so long he considered the restoration of these persons as a\r\ngross indignity, the submitting to which would destroy all his credit\r\nand influence in the country; but when it was to accommodate his own\r\noccasions in a treaty with a fellow-servant, all these difficulties\r\ninstantly vanish, and he finds it perfectly consistent with his dignity,\r\ncredit, and influence, to do for Mr. Francis what he had refused to the\r\nstrict and reiterated injunctions of the Court of Directors.\r\nTranquillity was, however, for a time restored by this measure, though\r\nit did not continue long. In about three months an occasion occurred in\r\nwhich Mr. Francis gave some opposition to a measure proposed by Mr.\r\nHastings, which brought on a duel, upon the mischievous effects of which\r\nyour Committee have already made their observations.\r\n\r\nThe departure of Mr. Francis soon after for Europe opened a new scene,\r\nand gave rise to a third revolution. Lest the arrangement with the\r\nservants of the Company should have the least appearance of being\r\nmistaken for obedience to their superiors, Mr. Francis was little more\r\nthan a month gone, when Mr. Fowke was again recalled from Benares, _and\r\nMr. Bristow soon after from Oude_. In these measures Mr. Hastings has\r\ncombined the principles of disobedience which he had used in all the\r\ncases hitherto stated. In his Minute of Consultation on this recall he\r\nrefers to his former Minutes; and he adds, that he has \"a recent motive\r\nin the necessity of removing any circumstance which may contribute to\r\nlessen his _influence_ in the effect of any negotiations in which he may\r\nbe engaged in the prosecution of his intended visit to Lucknow.\" He here\r\nreverts to his old plea of preserving his influence; not content with\r\nthis, as in the case of Mahomed Reza Khân he had called in the aid of\r\nthe Nabob of Bengal, he here calls in the aid of the Nabob of Oude, who,\r\non reasons exactly tallying with those given by Mr. Hastings, desires\r\nthat Mr. Bristow may be removed. The true weight of these requisitions\r\nwill appear, if not sufficiently apparent from the known situation of\r\nthe parties, by the following extract of a letter from this Nabob of\r\nOude to his agent at Calcutta, desiring him to acquaint Mr. Hastings,\r\nthat, \"if it is proper, I will write to the king [of Great Britain], and\r\nthe vizier [one of his Majesty's ministers], and the chief of the\r\nCompany, _in such a manner as he shall direct, and in the words that he\r\nshall order_, that Mr. Bristow's views may be thwarted there.\" There is\r\nno doubt of the entire coöperation of the Nabob Asoph ul Dowlah in all\r\nthe designs of Mr. Hastings, and in thwarting the views of any persons\r\nwho place their reliance on the authority of this kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the Court of Directors appear in their proper order in the\r\nprocession. After this third act of disobedience with regard to the\r\nsame person and the same office, and after calling the proceedings\r\nunwarrantable, \"_in order to vindicate and uphold their own authority,\r\nand thinking it a duty incumbent on them to maintain the authority of\r\nthe Court of Directors_,\" they again order Mr. Bristow to be reinstated,\r\nand Mr. Middleton to be recalled: in this circle the whole moves with\r\ngreat regularity.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary operations of Mr. Hastings, that soon after followed\r\nin every department which was the subject of all these acts of\r\ndisobedience, have made them appear in a light peculiarly unpropitious\r\nto his cause. It is but too probable, from his own accounts, that he\r\nmeditated some strong measure, both at Benares and at Oude, at the very\r\ntime of the removal of those officers. He declares he knew that his\r\nconduct in those places was such as to lie very open to malicious\r\nrepresentations; he must have been sensible that he was open to such\r\nrepresentations from the beginning; he was therefore impelled by every\r\nmotive which ought to influence a man of sense by no means to disturb\r\nthe order which he had last established.\r\n\r\nOf this, however, he took no care; but he was not so inattentive to the\r\nsatisfaction of the sufferers, either in point of honor or of interest.\r\nThis was most strongly marked in the case of Mr. Fowke. His reparation\r\nto that gentleman, in point of honor, is as full as possible. Mr.\r\nHastings \"declared, that he approved his character and his conduct in\r\noffice, and believed that he might _depend_ upon _his exact and literal\r\nobedience and fidelity_ in the execution of the functions annexed to\r\nit.\" Such is the character of the man whom Mr. Hastings a second time\r\nremoved from the office to which he told the Court of Directors, in his\r\nletter of the 3rd of March, 1780, he had appointed him in conformity to\r\ntheir orders. On the 14th of January, 1781, he again finds it an\r\nindispensable obligation in him to exercise powers \"_inherent_ in the\r\nconstitution of his government.\" On this principle he claimed \"the right\r\nof nominating the agent of his own choice to the Residence of Benares;\r\nthat it is a representative situation: that, speaking for myself\r\n_alone_, it may be _sufficient_ to say, that Mr. Francis Fowke is not\r\n_my_ agent; _that I cannot give him my confidence_; that, while he\r\ncontinues at Benares, he stands as a screen between the Rajah and this\r\ngovernment, instead of an instrument of control; that the Rajah himself,\r\nand every chief in Hindostan, will regard it as the pledge and\r\nfoundation of his independence.\" Here Mr. Hastings has got back to his\r\nold principles, where he takes post as on strong ground. This he\r\ndeclares \"to be his objection to Mr. Fowke, and that it is insuperable.\"\r\nThe very line before this paragraph he writes of this person, to whom he\r\n_could_ not give his _confidence_, that \"he believed he might _depend_\r\nupon _his fidelity_, and his exact and literal obedience.\" Mr. Scott,\r\nwho is authorized to defend Mr. Hastings, supported the same principles\r\nbefore your Committee by a comparison that avowedly reduces the Court of\r\nDirectors to the state of a party against their servants. He declared,\r\nthat, in his opinion, \"it would be just as _absurd_ to _deprive him_ of\r\nthe power of nominating his ambassador at Benares as it would be to\r\nforce on _the ministry_ of this country an ambassador from _the\r\nopposition_.\" Such is the opinion entertained in Bengal, and that but\r\ntoo effectually realized, of the relation between the principal servants\r\nof the Company and the Court of Directors.\r\n\r\nSo far the reparation, in point of honor, to Mr. Fowke was complete. The\r\nreparation in point of interest your Committee do not find to have been\r\nequally satisfactory; but they do find it to be of the most\r\nextraordinary nature, and of the most mischievous example. Mr. Fowke had\r\nbeen deprived of a place of rank and honor,--the place of a public\r\n_Vackeel_, or representative. The recompense provided for him is a\r\nsuccession to a contract. Mr. Hastings moved, that, on the expiration of\r\nColonel Morgan's contract, he should be appointed agent to all the boats\r\nemployed for the military service of that establishment, with a\r\ncommission of _fifteen per cent on all disbursements in that\r\noffice_,--permitting Mr. Fowke, at the same time, to draw his allowance\r\nof an hundred pounds a month, as Resident, until the expiration of the\r\ncontract, and for three months after.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings is himself struck, as every one must be, with so\r\nextraordinary a proceeding, the principle of which, he observes, \"is\r\nliable to _one_ material objection.\" That one is material indeed; for,\r\nno limit being laid down for the expense in which the percentage is to\r\narise, it is the direct interest of the person employed to make his\r\ndepartment as expensive as possible. To this Mr. Hastings answers, that\r\n\"he is convinced by experience it will be better performed\"; and yet he\r\nimmediately after subjoins, \"This _defect_ can _only_ be corrected by\r\nthe probity of the person intrusted with so important a charge; and I am\r\nwilling to have it understood, as a proof of _the confidence I repose in\r\nMr. Fowke_, that I have proposed his appointment, in opposition _to a\r\ngeneral principle_, to a trust so constituted.\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this very Minute of Consultation, Mr. Hastings\r\nremoves Mr. Fowke from the Residency of Benares because \"he cannot give\r\nhim his confidence\"; and yet, before the pen is out of his hand, he\r\nviolates one of the soundest general principles in the whole system of\r\ndealing, in order to give a proof of the confidence he reposes in that\r\ngentleman. This apparent gross contradiction is to be reconciled but by\r\none way,--which is, that confidence with Mr. Hastings comes and goes\r\nwith his opposition to legal authority. Where that authority recommends\r\nany person, his confidence in him vanishes; but to show that it is the\r\nauthority, and not the person, he opposes, when that is out of sight,\r\nthere is no rule so sacred which is not to be violated to manifest his\r\nreal esteem and perfect trust in the person whom he has rejected.\r\nHowever, by overturning general principles to compliment Mr. Fowke's\r\nintegrity, he does all in his power to corrupt it; at the same time he\r\nestablishes an example that must either subject all future dealings to\r\nthe same pernicious clause, or which, being omitted, must become a\r\nstrong implied charge on the integrity of those who shall hereafter be\r\nexcluded from a trust so constituted.\r\n\r\nIt is not foreign to the object of your Committee, in this part of their\r\nobservations, which relates to the obedience to orders, to remark upon\r\nthe manner in which the orders of the Court of Directors with regard to\r\nthis kind of dealing in contracts are observed. These orders relate to\r\ncontracts; and they contain two standing regulations.\r\n\r\n1st, That all contracts shall be publicly advertised, and that the most\r\nreasonable proposals shall be accepted.\r\n\r\n2ndly, That two contracts, those of provisions and for carriage\r\nbullocks, shall be only annual.\r\n\r\nThese orders are undoubtedly some correctives to the abuses which may\r\narise in this very critical article of public dealing. But the House\r\nwill remark, that, if the business usually carried on by contracts can\r\nbe converted at pleasure into agencies, like that of Mr. Fowke, all\r\nthese regulations perish of course, and there is no direction whatsoever\r\nfor restraining the most prodigal and corrupt bargains for the public.\r\n\r\nYour Committee have inquired into the observance of these necessary\r\nregulations, and they find that they have, like the rest, been entirely\r\ncontemned, and contemned with entire impunity. After the period of\r\nColonel Monson's death, and Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell obtaining the\r\nlead in the Council, the contracts were disposed of without at all\r\nadvertising for proposals. Those in 1777 were given for three years; and\r\nthe gentlemen in question growing by habit and encouragement into more\r\nboldness, in 1779 the contracts were disposed of for five years: and\r\nthis they did at the eve of the expiration of their own appointment to\r\nthe government. This increase in the length of the contracts, though\r\ncontrary to orders, might have admitted some excuse, if it had been\r\nmade, even in appearance, the means of lessening the expense. But the\r\nadvantages allowed to the contractors, instead of being diminished, were\r\nenlarged, and in a manner far beyond the proportion of the enlargement\r\nof terms. Of this abuse and contempt of orders a judgment may be formed\r\nby the single contract for supplying the army with draught and carriage\r\nbullocks. As it stood at the expiration of the contract in 1779, the\r\nexpense of that service was about one thousand three hundred pounds a\r\nmonth. By the new contract, given away in September of that year, the\r\nservice was raised to the enormous sum of near six thousand pounds a\r\nmonth. The monthly increase, therefore, being four thousand seven\r\nhundred pounds, it constitutes a total increase of charges for the\r\nCompany, in the five years of the contract, of no less a sum than two\r\nhundred and thirty-five thousand pounds. Now, as the former contract\r\nwas, without doubt, sufficiently advantageous, a judgment may be formed\r\nof the extravagance of the present. The terms, indeed, pass the bounds\r\nof all allowance for negligence and ignorance of office.\r\n\r\nThe case of Mr. Belli's contract for supplying provisions to the Fort is\r\nof the same description; and what exceedingly increases the suspicion\r\nagainst this profusion, in contracts made in direct violation of orders,\r\nis, that they are always found to be given in favor of persons closely\r\nconnected with Mr. Hastings in his family, or even in his actual\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell justify this\r\ndisobedience, if admitted, reduce the Company's government, so far as it\r\nregards the Supreme Council, to a mere patronage,--to a mere power of\r\nnominating persons to or removing them from an authority which, is not\r\nonly despotic with regard to those who are subordinate to it, but in all\r\nits acts entirely independent of the legal power which is nominally\r\nsuperior. These are principles directly leading to the destruction of\r\nthe Company's government. A correspondent practice being established,\r\n(as in this case of contracts, as well as others, it has been,) the\r\nmeans are furnished of effectuating this purpose: for the common\r\nsuperior, the Company, having no power to regulate or to support their\r\nown appointments, nor to remove those whom they wish to remove, nor to\r\nprevent the contracts from being made use of against their interest, all\r\nthe English in Bengal must naturally look to the next in authority; they\r\nmust depend upon, follow, and attach themselves to him solely; and thus\r\na party may be formed of the whole system of civil and military servants\r\nfor the support of the subordinate, and defiance of the supreme power.\r\n\r\nYour Committee being led to attend to the abuse of contracts, which are\r\ngiven upon principles fatal to the subordination of the service, and in\r\ndefiance of orders, revert to the disobedience of orders in the case of\r\nMahomed Reza Khân.\r\n\r\nThis transaction is of a piece with those that preceded it. On the 6th\r\nof July, 1781, Mr. Hastings announced to the board the arrival of a\r\nmessenger and introduced a requisition from the young Nabob Mobarek ul\r\nDowlah, \"that he might be _permitted to dispose of his own stipend,\r\nwithout being made to depend on the will of another_.\" In favor of this\r\nrequisition Mr. Hastings urged various arguments:--that the Nabob could\r\nno longer be deemed a minor;--that he was twenty-six years of age, and\r\nfather of many children;--that his understanding was much improved _of\r\nlate_ by an attention to his education;--that these circumstances gave\r\nhim a claim to the uncontrolled exercise of domestic authority; and it\r\nmight reasonably be supposed that he would pay a greater regard to a\r\njust economy in his own family than had been observed by those who were\r\naliens to it. For these reasons Mr. Hastings recommended to the board\r\nthat Mahomed Reza Khân should be immediately divested of the office of\r\nsuperintendent of the Nabob's household, _and that the Nabob Mobarek ul\r\nDowlah should be intrusted with the exclusive and entire receipts and\r\ndisbursements of his stipend, and the uncontrolled management and\r\nregulation of his household_. Thus far your Committee are of opinion,\r\nthat the conclusion corresponds with the premises; for, supposing the\r\nfact to be established or admitted, that the Nabob, in point of age,\r\ncapacity, and judgment, was qualified to act for himself, it seems\r\nreasonable that the management of his domestic affairs should not be\r\nwithheld from him. On this part of the proceeding your Committee will\r\nonly observe, that, if it were strictly true that the Nabob's\r\nunderstanding had been much improved _of late_ by an attention to his\r\neducation, (which seems an extraordinary way of describing the\r\nqualifications of a man of six-and-twenty, the father of many children,)\r\nthe merit of such improvement must be attributed to Mahomed Reza Khân,\r\nwho was the only person of rank and character connected with him, or who\r\ncould be supposed to have any influence over him. Mr. Hastings himself\r\nreproaches the Nabob with _raising mean men to be his companions_, and\r\ntells him plainly, _that some persons, both of bad character and base\r\norigin, had found the means of insinuating themselves into his company\r\nand constant fellowship_. In such society it is not likely that either\r\nthe Nabob's morals or his understanding could have been _much improved_;\r\nnor could it be deemed prudent to leave him without any check upon his\r\nconduct. Mr. Hastings's opinion on this point may be collected from what\r\nhe did, but by no means from what he said, on the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe House will naturally expect to find that the Nabob's request was\r\ngranted, and that the resolution of the board was conformable to the\r\nterms of Mr. Hastings's recommendation. Yet the fact is directly the\r\nreverse. Mr. Hastings, after advising _that the Nabob should be\r\nintrusted with the exclusive and entire receipts and disbursements of\r\nhis stipend_, immediately corrects that advice, _being aware that so\r\nsudden and unlimited a disposal of a large revenue might at first\r\nencourage a spirit of dissipation in the Nabob_,--and reserves to\r\n_himself_ a power of establishing, _with the Nabob's consent_, such a\r\nplan for the regulation and equal distribution of the Nabob's expenses\r\n_as should be adapted to the dissimilar appearances of preserving his\r\ninterests and his independence at the same time_. On the same\r\ncomplicated principles the subsequent resolution of the board professes\r\nto allow the Nabob the management of his stipend and expenses,--with _an\r\nhope_, however, (which, considering the relative situation of the\r\nparties, could be nothing less than an injunction,) that he would submit\r\nto such a plan _as should be agreed on between him_ and the\r\nGovernor-General.\r\n\r\nThe drift of these contradictions is sufficiently apparent. Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân was to be divested of his office at all events, and the management\r\nof the Nabob's stipend committed to other hands. To accomplish the\r\nfirst, the Nabob is said to be \"now arrived at that time of life when a\r\nman may be supposed capable, _if ever_, of managing his own concerns.\"\r\nWhen this principle has answered the momentary purpose for which it was\r\nproduced, we find it immediately discarded, and an opposite resolution\r\nformed on an opposite principle, viz., that he shall _not_ have the\r\nmanagement of his own concerns, _in consideration of his want of\r\nexperience_.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, on his arrival at Moorshedabad, gives Mr. Wheler an\r\naccount of his interview with the Nabob, and of the Nabob's implicit\r\nsubmission to his advice. The principal, if not the sole, object of the\r\nwhole operation appears from the result of it. Sir John D'Oyly, a\r\ngentleman in whom Mr. Hastings places particular confidence, succeeds to\r\nthe office of Mahomed Reza Khân, and to the same control over the\r\nNabob's expenses. Into the hands of this gentleman the Nabob's stipend\r\nwas _to be immediately paid, as every intermediate channel would be an\r\nunavoidable cause of delay_; and to _his_ advice the Nabob was required\r\nto give the same attention as if it were given by Mr. Hastings himself.\r\nOne of the conditions prescribed to the Nabob was, that he should admit\r\nno Englishman to his presence without previously consulting Sir John\r\nD'Oyly; _and he must forbid any person of that nation to be intruded\r\nwithout his introduction_. On these arrangements it need only be\r\nobserved, that a measure which sets out with professing to relieve the\r\nNabob from a state of _perpetual pupilage_ concludes with delivering not\r\nonly his fortune, but his person, to the custody of a particular friend\r\nof Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given to the Nabob contain other passages that merit\r\nattention. In one place Mr. Hastings tells him, \"You have offered to\r\ngive up the sum of four lacs of rupees to be allowed the free use of the\r\nremainder; but this we have refused.\" In another he says, that, \"_as\r\nmany matters will occur which cannot be so easily explained by letter as\r\nby conversation_, I desire that you will on such occasions give your\r\norders to Sir John D'Oyly respecting such points as you may desire to\r\nhave imparted to _me_.\" The offer alluded to in the first passage does\r\nnot appear in the Nabob's letters, therefore must have been in\r\nconversation, and declined by Mr. Hastings without consulting his\r\ncolleague. A refusal of it might have been proper; but it supposes a\r\ndegree of incapacity in the Nabob not to be reconciled to the principles\r\non which Mahomed Reza Khân was removed from the management of his\r\naffairs. Of the matters alluded to in the second, and which, it is said,\r\n_could not be so easily explained by letters as in conversation_, no\r\nexplanation is given. Your Committee will therefore leave them, as Mr.\r\nHastings has done, to the opinion of the House.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Nabob's requisition was communicated to the board, it was\r\nmoved and resolved that Mahomed Reza Khân should be divested of his\r\noffice; and the House have seen in what manner it was disposed of. The\r\nNabob had stated various complaints against him:--that he had dismissed\r\nthe old established servants of the Nizamut, and filled their places\r\nwith his own dependants;--that he had _regularly received_ the stipend\r\nof the Nizamut from the Company, yet had kept the Nabob involved in debt\r\nand distress, and exposed to the clamors of his creditors, and sometimes\r\neven in want of a dinner. All these complaints were recorded at large in\r\nthe proceedings of the Council; but it does not appear that they were\r\never communicated to Mahomed Reza Khân, or that he was ever called upon,\r\nin any shape, to answer them. This circumstance inclines your Committee\r\nto believe that all of these charges were groundless,--especially as it\r\nappears on the face of the proceedings, that the chief of them were not\r\nwell founded. Mr. Hastings, in his letter to Mr. Wheler, urges the\r\nabsolute necessity of the monthly payment of the Nabob's stipend _being\r\nregularly made_, and says, that, to relieve the Nabob's present wants,\r\nhe had directed the Resident to raise an immediate supply on the credit\r\nof the Company, to be repaid from the first receipts. From hence your\r\nCommittee conclude that the monthly payments had _not_ been regularly\r\nmade, and that whatever distresses the Nabob might have suffered must\r\nhave been owing to the Governor-General and Council, not to Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân, who, for aught that appears to the contrary, paid away the stipend\r\nas fast as he received it. Had it been otherwise, that is, if Mahomed\r\nReza Khân had reserved a balance of the Nabob's money in his hands, he\r\nshould, and undoubtedly he would, have been called upon to pay it in;\r\nand then there would have been no necessity for raising an immediate\r\nsupply by other means.\r\n\r\nThe transaction, on the whole, speaks very sufficiently for itself. It\r\nis a gross instance of repeated disobedience to repeated orders; and it\r\nis rendered particularly offensive to the authority of the Court of\r\nDirectors by the frivolous and contradictory reasons assigned for it.\r\nBut whether the Nabob's requisition was reasonable or not, the\r\nGovernor-General and Council were precluded by a special instruction\r\nfrom complying with it. The Directors, in their letter of the 14th of\r\nFebruary, 1779, declare, that a resolution of Council, (taken by Mr.\r\nFrancis and Mr. Wheler, in the absence of Mr. Barwell,) viz., \"that the\r\nNabob's letter should be referred to _them_ for _their_ decision, and\r\nthat no resolution should be taken in Bengal on his requisitions without\r\ntheir special orders and instructions,\" was very proper. They prudently\r\nreserved to themselves the right of deciding on such questions; but\r\nthey reserved it to no purpose. In England the authority is purely\r\nformal. In Bengal the power is positive and real. When they clash, their\r\nopposition serves only to degrade the authority that ought to\r\npredominate, and to exalt the power that ought to be dependent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the closing of the above Report, many material papers have arrived\r\nfrom India, and have been laid before your Committee. That which they\r\nthink it most immediately necessary to annex to the Appendix to this\r\nReport is the resolution of the Council-General to allow to the members\r\nof the Board of Trade resident in Calcutta a charge of five per cent on\r\nthe sale in England of the investment formed upon their second plan,\r\nnamely, that plan which had been communicated to Lord Macartney. The\r\ninvestment on this plan is stated to be raised from 800,000_l._ to\r\n1,000,000_l._ sterling.\r\n\r\nIt is on all accounts a very memorable transaction, and tends to bring\r\non a heavy burden, operating in the nature of a tax laid by their own\r\nauthority on the goods of their masters in England. If such a\r\ncompensation to the Board of Trade was necessary on account of their\r\nengagement to take no further (that is to say, no unlawful) emolument,\r\nit implies that the practice of making such unlawful emolument had\r\nformerly existed; and your Committee think it very extraordinary that\r\nthe first notice the Company had received of such a practice should be\r\nin taxing them for a compensation for a partial abolition of it, secured\r\non the parole of honor of those very persons who are supposed to have\r\nbeen guilty of this unjustifiable conduct. Your Committee consider this\r\nengagement, if kept, as only a partial abolition of the implied corrupt\r\npractice: because no part of the compensation is given to the members of\r\nthe Board of Trade who reside at the several factories, though their\r\nmeans of abuse are without all comparison greater; and if the corruption\r\nwas supposed so extensive as to be bought off at that price where the\r\nmeans were fewer, the House will judge how far the tax has purchased off\r\nthe evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See the Secret Committee's Reports on the Mahratta War.\r\n\r\n[2] Vide Secret Committee Reports.\r\n\r\n[3] Vide Select Committee Reports, 1781\r\n\r\n[4] The sale, to the amount of about one hundred thousand pounds\r\nannually, of the export from Great Britain ought to be deducted from\r\nthis million.\r\n\r\n[5] Estimate of the Sale Amount and Net Proceeds in England of the\r\nCargoes to be sent from Bengal, agreeable to the Plan received by Letter\r\ndated the 8th April, 1782.\r\n\r\nThis calculation supposes the eighty lac investments will be equal to\r\nthe tonnage of five ships.\r\n\r\n[B] 2.

The duty of five per cent is charged by the Company on the gross\r\nsale amount of all private trade licensed to be brought from India: the\r\namount of this duty is the only benefit the Company are likely to\r\nreceive from the subscription investment.\r\n\r\n[E] 5. This charge is likewise made on private trade goods, and is\r\nlittle, if anything, more than the real expense the Company are at on\r\naccount of the same; therefore no benefit will probably arise to the\r\nCompany from it on the sale of the said investment.\r\n\r\n[F] 6.

These pretended free gifts from the natives to the\r\nCompany's servants in power had never been authorized by law; they are\r\ncontrary to the covenants formerly entered into by the President and\r\nCouncil, they are strictly forbidden by the act of Parliament, and\r\nforbidden upon grounds of the most substantial policy.\r\n\r\nBefore the Regulating Act of 1773, the allowances made by the Company to\r\nthe Presidents of Bengal were abundantly sufficient to guaranty them\r\nagainst anything like a necessity for giving into that pernicious\r\npractice. The act of Parliament which appointed a Governor-General in\r\nthe place of a President, as it was extremely particular in enforcing\r\nthe prohibition of those presents, so it was equally careful in making\r\nan ample provision for supporting the dignity of the office, in order to\r\nremove all excuse for a corrupt increase of its emoluments.\r\n\r\nAlthough evidence on record, as well as verbal testimony, has appeared\r\nbefore your Committee of presents to a large amount having been received\r\nby Mr. Hastings and others before the year 1775, they were not able to\r\nfind distinct traces of that practice in him or any one else for a few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe inquiries set on foot in Bengal, by order of the Court of Directors,\r\nin 1775, with regard to all corrupt practices, and the vigor with which\r\nthey were for some time pursued, might have given a temporary check to\r\nthe receipt of presents, or might have produced a more effectual\r\nconcealment of them, and afterwards the calamities which befell almost\r\nall who were concerned in the first discoveries did probably prevent any\r\nfurther complaint upon the subject; but towards the close of the last\r\nsession your Committee have received much of new and alarming\r\ninformation concerning that abuse.\r\n\r\nThe first traces appeared, though faintly and obscurely, in a letter to\r\nthe Court of Directors from the Governor-General, Mr. Hastings, written\r\non the 29th of November, 1780.[14] It has been stated in a former Report\r\nof your Committee,[15] that on the 26th of June, 1780, Mr. Hastings\r\nbeing very earnest in the prosecution of a particular operation in the\r\nMahratta war, in order to remove objections to that measure, which were\r\nmade on account of the expense of the contingencies, he offered to\r\n_exonerate_ the Company from that \"charge.\" Continuing his Minute of\r\nCouncil, he says, \"That sum\" (a sum of about 23,000_l._) \"I have already\r\ndeposited, within a small amount, in the hands of the sub-treasurer; and\r\nI _beg_ that the board will _permit_ it to be accepted for that\r\nservice.\" Here he offers in his own person; he deposits, or pretends\r\nthat he deposits, in his own person; and, with the zeal of a man eager\r\nto pledge his private fortune in support of his measures, he prays that\r\nhis offer may be accepted. Not the least hint that he was delivering\r\nback to the Company money of their own, which he had secreted from them.\r\nIndeed, no man ever made it a request, much less earnestly entreated,\r\n\"begged to be permitted,\" to pay to any persons, public or private,\r\nmoney that was their own.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to your Committee that the money offered for that service,\r\nwhich was to forward the operations of a detachment under Colonel Camac\r\nin an expedition against one of the Mahratta chiefs, was not accepted.\r\nAnd your Committee, having directed search to be made for any sums of\r\nmoney paid into the Treasury by Mr. Hastings for this service, found,\r\nthat, notwithstanding his assertion of having deposited \"two lacs of\r\nrupees, or within a trifle of that sum, in the hands of the\r\nsub-treasurer,\" no entry whatsoever of that or any other payment by the\r\nGovernor-General was made in the Treasury accounts at or about that\r\ntime.[16] This circumstance appeared very striking to your Committee, as\r\nthe non-appearance in the Company's books of the article in question\r\nmust be owing to one or other of these four causes:--That the assertion\r\nof Mr. Hastings, of his having paid in near two lacs of rupees at that\r\ntime, was not true; or that the sub-treasurer may receive great sums in\r\ndeposit without entering them in the Company's Treasury accounts; or\r\nthat the Treasury books themselves are records not to be depended on;\r\nor, lastly, that faithful copies of these books of accounts are not\r\ntransmitted to Europe. The defect of an entry corresponding with Mr.\r\nHastings's declaration in Council can be attributed only to one of these\r\nfour causes,--of which the want of foundation in his recorded assertion,\r\nthough very blamable, is the least alarming.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of November following, Mr. Hastings communicated to the\r\nCourt of Directors some sort of notice of this transaction.[17] In his\r\nletter of that date he varies in no small degree the aspect under which\r\nthe business appeared in his Minute of Consultation of the 26th of June.\r\nIn his letter he says to the Directors, \"The subject is now become\r\nobsolete; the fair hopes which I had built upon the prosecution of the\r\nMahratta war have been blasted by the dreadful calamities which have\r\nbefallen your Presidency of Fort St. George, and changed the object of\r\nour pursuit from the _aggrandizement_ of your power to its\r\npreservation.\" After thus confessing, or rather boasting, of his motives\r\nto the Mahratta war, he proceeds: \"My present reason for reverting to my\r\nown conduct on the occasion which I have mentioned\" (namely, his\r\noffering a sum of money for the Company's service) \"is to obviate _the\r\nfalse conclusions or purposed misrepresentations_ which may be made of\r\nit, either as an artifice of _ostentation_ or the effect of _corrupt\r\ninfluence_, by assuring you that the money, _by whatever means it came\r\ninto my possession, was not my own_, that I had myself _no right_ to it,\r\nnor would or could have received it but for the occasion which prompted\r\nme to avail myself _of the accidental means_ which were at that instant\r\nafforded me of accepting and converting it to the property and use of\r\nthe Company: and with this brief apology I shall dismiss the subject.\"\r\n\r\nThe apology is brief indeed, considering the nature of the transaction;\r\nand what is more material than its length or its shortness, it is in all\r\npoints unsatisfactory. The matter becomes, if possible, more obscure by\r\nhis explanation. Here was money received by Mr. Hastings, which,\r\naccording to his own judgment, he had no right to receive; it was money\r\nwhich, \"but for the occasion that prompted him, he could not have\r\naccepted\"; it was money which came into his, and from his into the\r\nCompany's hands, by ways and means undescribed, and from persons\r\nunnamed: yet, though apprehensive of false conclusions and purposed\r\nmisrepresentations, he gives his employers no insight whatsoever into a\r\nmatter which of all others stood in the greatest need of a full and\r\nclear elucidation.\r\n\r\nAlthough he chooses to omit this essential point, he expresses the most\r\nanxious solicitude to clear himself of the charges that might be made\r\nagainst him, of the artifices of ostentation, and of corrupt influence.\r\nTo discover, if possible, the ground for apprehending such imputations,\r\nyour Committee adverted to the circumstances in which he stood at the\r\ntime: they found that this letter was dispatched about the time that\r\nMr. Francis took his passage for England; his fear of misrepresentation\r\nmay therefore allude to something which passed in conversation between\r\nhim and that gentleman at the time the offer was made.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy, on the mere face of his offer, to give an ill turn to\r\nit. The act, as it stands on the Minute, is not only disinterested, but\r\ngenerous and public-spirited. If Mr. Hastings apprehended\r\nmisrepresentation from Mr. Francis, or from any other person, your\r\nCommittee conceive that he did not employ proper means for defeating the\r\nill designs of his adversaries. On the contrary, the course he has taken\r\nin his letter to the Court of Directors is calculated to excite doubts\r\nand suspicions in minds the most favorably disposed to him. Some degree\r\nof ostentation is not extremely blamable at a time when a man advances\r\nlargely from his private fortune towards the public service. It is human\r\ninfirmity at the worst, and only detracts something from the lustre of\r\nan action in itself meritorious. The kind of ostentation which is\r\ncriminal, and criminal only because it is fraudulent, is where a person\r\nmakes a show of giving when in reality he does not give. This imposition\r\nis criminal more or less according to the circumstances. But if the\r\nmoney received to furnish such a pretended gift is taken from any third\r\nperson without right to take it, a new guilt, and guilt of a much worse\r\nquality and description, is incurred. The Governor-General, in order to\r\nkeep clear of ostentation, on the 29th of November, 1780, declares, that\r\nthe sum of money which he offered on the 26th of the preceding June as\r\nhis own was not his own, and that he had no right to it. Clearing\r\nhimself of vanity, he convicts himself of deceit, and of injustice.\r\n\r\nThe other object of this brief apology was to clear himself of _corrupt\r\ninfluence_. Of all ostentation he stands completely acquitted in the\r\nmonth of November, however he might have been faulty in that respect in\r\nthe month of June; but with regard to the other part of the apprehended\r\ncharge, namely, _corrupt influence_, he gives no satisfactory solution.\r\nA great sum of money \"not his own,\"--money to which \"he had no\r\nright,\"--money which came into his possession \"by whatever means\":--if\r\nthis be not money obtained by corrupt influence, or by something worse,\r\nthat is, by violence or terror, it will be difficult to fix upon\r\ncircumstances which can furnish a presumption of unjustifiable use of\r\npower and influence in the acquisition of profit. The last part of the\r\napology, that he had converted this money (\"which he had no right to\r\nreceive\") to the Company's use, so far as your Committee can discover,\r\n_does nowhere appear_. He speaks, in the Minute of the 26th of June, as\r\nhaving _then_ actually deposited it for the Company's service; in the\r\nletter of November he says that he converted it to the Company's\r\nproperty: but there is no trace in the Company's books of its being ever\r\nbrought to their credit in the expenditure for any specific service,\r\neven if any such entry and expenditure could justify him in taking money\r\nwhich he had by his own confession, \"no right to receive.\"\r\n\r\nThe Directors appear to have been deceived by this representation, and\r\nin their letter of January, 1782,[18] consider the money as actually\r\npaid into their Treasury. Even under their error concerning the\r\napplication of the money, they appear rather alarmed than satisfied\r\nwith the brief apology of the Governor-General. They consider the whole\r\nproceeding as _extraordinary and mysterious_. They, however, do not\r\ncondemn it with any remarkable asperity; after admitting that he might\r\nbe induced to a temporary secrecy _respecting the members of the board_,\r\nfrom a fear of their resisting the proposed application, or any\r\napplication of this money to the Company's use, yet they write to the\r\nGovernor-General and Council as follows:--\"It does not appear to us that\r\nthere could be any real necessity for delaying to communicate to _us_\r\nimmediate information of the _channel_ by which the money came into Mr.\r\nHastings's possession, with a complete illustration of the cause or\r\ncauses of so _extraordinary_ an event.\" And again: \"The means proposed\r\nof defraying the extra expenses are very _extraordinary_; and the money,\r\nwe conceive, must have come into his hands by an _unusual_ channel; and\r\nwhen more complete information comes before us, we shall give our\r\nsentiments fully on the transaction.\" And speaking of this and other\r\nmoneys under a similar description, they say, \"We shall suspend our\r\njudgment, without approving it in the least degree, or proceeding to\r\ncensure our Governor-General for this transaction.\" The expectations\r\nentertained by the Directors of a more complete explanation were\r\nnatural, and their expression tender and temperate. But the more\r\ncomplete information which they naturally expected they never have to\r\nthis day received.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings wrote two more letters to the Secret Committee of the Court\r\nof Directors, in which he mentions this transaction: the first dated (as\r\nhe asserts, and a Mr. Larkins swears) on the 22d of May, 1782;[19] the\r\nlast, which accompanied it, so late as the 16th of December in the same\r\nyear.[20] Though so long an interval lay between the transaction of the\r\n26th of June, 1780, and the middle of December, 1782, (upwards of two\r\nyears,) no further satisfaction is given. He has written, since the\r\nreceipt of the above letter of the Court of Directors, (which demanded,\r\nwhat they had a right to demand, a clear explanation of the particulars\r\nof this sum of money which he had no right to receive,) without giving\r\nthem any further satisfaction. Instead of explanation or apology, he\r\nassumes a tone of complaint and reproach, to the Directors: he lays\r\nbefore them a kind of an account of presents received, to the amount of\r\nupwards of 200,000_l._,--some at a considerable distance of time, and\r\nwhich had not been hitherto communicated to the Company.\r\n\r\nIn the letter which accompanied that very extraordinary account, which\r\nthen for the first time appeared, he discovers no small solicitude to\r\nclear himself from the imputation of having these discoveries drawn from\r\nhim by the terrors of the Parliamentary inquiries then on foot. To\r\nremove all suspicion of such a motive for making these discoveries, Mr.\r\nLarkins swears, in an affidavit made before Mr. Justice Hyde, bearing\r\neven date with the letter which accompanies the account, that is, of the\r\n16th of December, 1782, that this letter had been written by him on the\r\n22d of May, several months before it was dispatched.[21] It appears that\r\nMr. Larkins, who makes this voluntary affidavit, is neither secretary to\r\nthe board, nor Mr. Hastings's private secretary, but an officer of the\r\nTreasury of Bengal.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings was conscious that a question would inevitably arise, how\r\nhe came to delay the sending intelligence of so very interesting a\r\nnature from May to December. He therefore thinks it necessary to account\r\nfor so suspicious a circumstance. He tells the Directors, \"that the\r\ndispatch of the 'Lively' having been protracted from time to time, the\r\naccompanying address, which was originally designed and prepared for\r\nthat dispatch, _and no other since occurring_, has of course been thus\r\nlong delayed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General's letter is dated the 22d May, and the \"Resolution\"\r\nwas the last ship of the season dispatched for Europe. The public\r\nletters to the Directors are dated the 9th May; but it appears by the\r\nletter of the commander of the ship that he did not receive his\r\ndispatches from Mr. Lloyd, then at Kedgeree, until the 26th May, and\r\nalso that the pilot was not discharged from the ship until the 11th\r\nJune. Some of these presents (now for the first time acknowledged) had\r\nbeen received eighteen months preceding the date of this letter,--none\r\nless than four months; so that, in fact, he might have sent this account\r\nby all the ships of that season; but the Governor-General chose to write\r\nthis letter thirteen days after the determination in Council for the\r\ndispatch of the last ship.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that he has given any communication whatsoever to his\r\ncolleagues in office of those extraordinary transactions. Nothing\r\nappears on the records of the Council of the receipt of the presents;\r\nnor is the transmission of this account mentioned in the general letter\r\nto the Court of Directors, but in a letter from himself to their Secret\r\nCommittee, consisting generally of two persons, but at most of three. It\r\nis to be observed that the Governor-General states, \"that the dispatch\r\nof the 'Lively' had been protracted from time to time; that this delay\r\nwas of no public consequence; but that it produced a situation which\r\nwith respect to himself he regarded as unfortunate, because it exposed\r\nhim to the meanest imputations, from the occasion which the late\r\nParliamentary inquiries have since furnished, but which were unknown\r\nwhen his letter was written.\" If the Governor-General thought his\r\nsilence exposed him to the _meanest imputations_, he had the means in\r\nhis own power of avoiding those imputations: he might have sent this\r\nletter, dated the 22d May, by the Resolution. For we find, that, in a\r\nletter from Captain Poynting, of the 26th May, he states it not possible\r\nfor him to proceed to sea with the smallest degree of safety without a\r\nsupply of anchors and cables, and most earnestly requests they may be\r\nsupplied from Calcutta; and on the 28th May we find a minute from the\r\nSecretary of the Council, Mr. Auriol, requesting an order of Council to\r\nthe master-attendant to furnish a sloop to carry down those cables;\r\nwhich order was accordingly issued on the 30th May. There requires no\r\nother proof to show that the Governor-General had the means of sending\r\nthis letter seven days after he wrote it, instead of delaying it for\r\nnear seven months, and because no conveyance had offered. Your Committee\r\nmust also remark, that the conveyance by land to Madras was certain; and\r\nwhilst such important operations were carrying on, both by sea and land,\r\nupon the coast, that dispatches would be sent to the Admiralty or to the\r\nCompany was highly probable.\r\n\r\nIf the letter of the 22d May had been found in the list of packets sent\r\nby the Resolution, the Governor General would have established in a\r\nsatisfactory manner, and far beyond the effect of any affidavit, that\r\nthe letter had been written at the time of the date. It appears that the\r\nResolution, being on her voyage to England, met with so severe a gale of\r\nwind as to be obliged to put back to Bengal, and to unload her cargo.\r\nThis event makes no difference in the state of the transaction. Whatever\r\nthe cause of these new discoveries might have been, at the time of\r\nsending them the fact of the Parliamentary inquiry was publicly known.\r\n\r\nIn the letter of the above date Mr. Hastings laments the mortification\r\nof being reduced to take precautions \"to guard his reputation from\r\ndishonor.\"--\"If I had,\" says he, \"_at any time_ possessed that degree of\r\nconfidence from my _immediate_ employers which they have never withheld\r\nfrom the _meanest_ of my predecessors, I should have disdained to use\r\nthese attentions.\"\r\n\r\nWho the _meanest_ of Mr. Hastings's predecessors were does not appear to\r\nyour Committee; nor are they able to discern the ground of propriety or\r\ndecency for his assuming to himself a right to call any of them mean\r\npersons. But if such mean persons have possessed that degree of\r\nconfidence from his immediate employers which for so many years he had\r\nnot possessed \"_at any time_,\" inferences must be drawn from thence very\r\nunfavorable to one or the other of the parties, or perhaps to both. The\r\nattentions which he practises and disdains can in this case be of no\r\nservice to himself, his employers, or the public; the only attention at\r\nall effectual towards extenuating, or in some degree atoning for, the\r\nguilt of having taken money from individuals illegally was to be full\r\nand fair in his confession of all the particulars of his offence. This\r\nmight not obtain that confidence which at no time he has enjoyed, but\r\nstill the Company and the nation might derive essential benefit from it;\r\nthe Directors might be able to afford redress to the sufferers; and by\r\nhis laying open the concealed channels of abuse, means might be\r\nfurnished for the better discovery, and possibly for the prevention, or\r\nat least for the restraint, of a practice of the most dangerous\r\nnature,--a practice of which the mere prohibition, without the means of\r\ndetection, must ever prove, as hitherto it had proved, altogether\r\nfrivolous.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, considering that so long a time had elapsed without any\r\nof that information which the Directors expected, and perceiving that\r\nthis receipt of sums of money under color of gift seemed a growing evil,\r\nordered the attendance of Mr. Hastings's agent, Major Scott. They had\r\nfound, on former occasions, that this gentleman was furnished with much\r\nmore early and more complete intelligence of the Company's affairs in\r\nIndia than was thought proper for the Court of Directors; they therefore\r\nexamined him concerning every particular sum of money the receipt of\r\nwhich Mr. Hastings had confessed in his account. It was to their\r\nsurprise that Mr. Scott professed himself perfectly uninstructed upon\r\nalmost every part of the subject, though the express object of his\r\nmission to England was to clear up such matters as might be objected to\r\nMr. Hastings; and for that purpose he had early qualified himself by the\r\nproduction to your Committee of his powers of agency. The ignorance in\r\nwhich Mr. Hastings had left his agent was the more striking, because he\r\nmust have been morally certain, that, if his conduct in these points\r\nshould have escaped animadversion from the Court of Directors, it must\r\nbecome an object of Parliamentary inquiry; for, in his letter of the\r\n15th [16th?] of December, 1782, to the Court of Directors, he expressly\r\nmentions his fears that those Parliamentary inquiries might be thought\r\nto have extorted from him the confessions which he had made.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, however, entering on a more strict examination\r\nconcerning the two lacs of rupees, which Mr. Hastings declares he had no\r\nright to take, but had taken from some person then unknown, Major Scott\r\nrecollected that Mr. Hastings had, in a letter of the 7th of December,\r\n1782, (in which he refers to some former letter,) acquainted him with\r\nthe name of the person from whom he had received these two lacs of\r\nrupees, mentioned in the minute of June, 1780. It turned out to be the\r\nRajah of Benares, the unfortunate Cheyt Sing.\r\n\r\nIn the single instance in which Mr. Scott seemed to possess intelligence\r\nin this matter, he is preferred to the Court of Directors. Under their\r\ncensure as Mr. Hastings was, and as he felt himself to be, for not\r\ninforming them of the channel in which he received that money, he\r\nperseveres obstinately and contemptuously to conceal it from them;\r\nthough he thought fit to intrust his agent with the secret.\r\n\r\nYour Committee were extremely struck with this intelligence. They were\r\ntotally unacquainted with it, when they presented to the House the\r\nSupplement to their Second Report, on the affairs of Cheyt Sing. A gift\r\nreceived by Mr. Hastings from the Rajah of Benares gave rise in their\r\nminds to serious reflections on the condition of the princes of India\r\nsubjected to the British authority. Mr. Hastings was, at the very time\r\nof his receiving this gift, in the course of making on the Rajah of\r\nBenares a series of demands, unfounded and unjustifiable, and constantly\r\ngrowing in proportion as they were submitted to. To these demands the\r\nRajah of Benares, besides his objections in point of right, constantly\r\nsat up a plea of poverty. Presents from persons who hold up poverty as a\r\nshield against extortion can scarcely in any case be considered as\r\ngratuitous, whether the plea of poverty be true or false. In this case\r\nthe presents might have been bestowed; if not with an assurance, at\r\nleast with a rational hope, of some mitigation in the oppressive\r\nrequisitions that were made by Mr. Hastings; for to give much\r\nvoluntarily, when it is known that much will be taken away forcibly, is\r\na thing absurd and impossible. On the other [one?] hand, the acceptance\r\nof that gift by Mr. Hastings must have pledged a tacit faith for some\r\ndegree of indulgence towards the donor: if it was a free gift,\r\ngratitude, if it was a bargain, justice obliged him to do it. If, on the\r\nother hand, Mr. Hastings originally destined (as he says he did) this\r\nmoney, given to himself secretly and for his private emolument, to the\r\nuse of the Company, the Company's favor, to whom he acted as trustee,\r\nought to have been purchased by it. In honor and justice he bound and\r\npledged himself for that power which was to profit by the gift, and to\r\nprofit, too, in the success of an expedition which Mr. Hastings thought\r\nso necessary to their aggrandizement. The unhappy man found his money\r\naccepted, but no favor acquired on the part either of the Company or of\r\nMr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nYour Committee have, in another Report, stated to the House that Mr.\r\nHastings attributed the extremity of distress which the detachments\r\nunder Colonel Camac had suffered, and the great desertions which ensued\r\non that expedition, to the want of punctuality of the Rajah in making\r\npayment of one of the sums which had been extorted from him; and this\r\nwant of punctual payment was afterwards assigned as a principal reason\r\nfor the ruin of this prince. Your Committee have shown to the House, by\r\na comparison of facts and dates, that this charge is wholly without\r\nfoundation. But if the cause of Colonel Camac's failure had been true as\r\nto the sum which was the object of the public demand, the failure could\r\nnot be attributed to the Rajah, when he had on the _instant_ privately\r\nfurnished at least 23,000_l._ to Mr. Hastings,--that is, furnished the\r\nidentical money which he tells us (but carefully concealing the name of\r\nthe giver) he had from the beginning destined, as he afterwards publicly\r\noffered, for this very expedition of Colonel Camac's. The complication\r\nof fraud and cruelty in the transaction admits of few parallels. Mr.\r\nHastings at the Council Board of Bengal displays himself as a zealous\r\nservant of the Company, bountifully giving from his own fortune, and in\r\nhis letter to the Directors (as he says himself) as going out of the\r\nordinary roads for their advantage;[22] and all this on the credit of\r\nsupplies derived from the gift of a man whom he treats with the utmost\r\nseverity, and whom he accuses, in this particular, of disaffection to\r\nthe Company's cause and interests.\r\n\r\nWith 23,000_l._ of the Rajah's money in his pocket, he persecutes him to\r\nhis destruction,--assigning for a reason, that his reliance on the\r\nRajah's faith, and his breach of it, were the principal causes that _no\r\nother_ provision was made for the detachment on the specific expedition\r\nto which the Rajah's specific money was to be applied. The Rajah had\r\ngiven it to be disposed of by Mr. Hastings; and if it was not disposed\r\nof in the best manner for the accomplishing his objects, the accuser\r\nhimself is the criminal.\r\n\r\nTo take money for the forbearance of a just demand would have been\r\ncorrupt only; but to urge unjust public demands,--to accept private\r\npecuniary favors in the course of those demands,--and, on the pretence\r\nof delay or refusal, without mercy to persecute a benefactor,--to refuse\r\nto hear his remonstrances,--to arrest him in his capital, in his palace,\r\nin the face of all the people,--thus to give occasion to an\r\ninsurrection, and, on pretext of that insurrection, to refuse all treaty\r\nor explanation,--to drive him from his government and his country,--to\r\nproscribe him in a general amnesty,--and to send him all over India a\r\nfugitive, to publish the shame of British government in all the nations\r\nto whom he successively fled for refuge,--these are proceedings to\r\nwhich, for the honor of human nature, it is hoped few parallels are to\r\nbe found in history, and in which the illegality and corruption of the\r\nacts form the smallest part of the mischief.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of the first sum _confessed_ to be taken as a\r\npresent by Mr. Hastings, since the year 1775; and such are its\r\nconsequences. Mr. Hastings apologizes for this action by declaring \"that\r\nhe would not have received the money but for the _occasion_, which\r\nprompted him to avail himself of the accidental means which were at that\r\ninstant afforded him of accepting and converting it to the use of the\r\nCompany.\"[23] By this account, he considers the act as excusable only by\r\nthe particular occasion, by the temptation of accidental means, and by\r\nthe suggestion of the _instant_. How far this is the case appears by the\r\nvery next paragraph of this letter in which the account is given and in\r\nwhich the apology is made. If these were his sentiments in June, 1780,\r\nthey lasted but a very short time: his accidental means appear to be\r\ngrowing habitual.\r\n\r\nTo point out in a clear manner the spirit of the second money\r\ntransaction to which your Committee adverted, which is represented by\r\nMr. Hastings as having some \"affinity with the former _anecdote_,\"[24]\r\n(for in this light kind of phrase he chooses to express himself to his\r\nmasters,) your Committee think it necessary to state to the House, that\r\nthe business, namely, this business, which was the second object of\r\ntheir inquiry, appears in three different papers and in three different\r\nlights: on comparing of these authorities, in every one of which Mr.\r\nHastings is himself the voucher, if one of the three be true, the other\r\ntwo must necessarily be false.\r\n\r\nThese three authorities, which your Committee has accurately compared,\r\nare, first, his minutes on the Consultations;[25] secondly, his letter\r\nto the Court of Directors on the 29th of November, 1780;[26] thirdly,\r\nhis account, transmitted on the 16th of December, 1782.[27]\r\n\r\nAbout eight months after the first transaction relative to Cheyt Sing,\r\nand which is just reported, that is, on the 5th of January, 1781, Mr.\r\nHastings produced a demand to the Council for money of his own expended\r\nfor the Company's service.[28] Here was no occasion for secrecy. Mr.\r\nFrancis was on his passage to Europe; Mr. Wheler was alone left, who no\r\nlonger dissented from anything; Mr. Hastings was in effect himself the\r\nwhole Council. He declared that _he_ had disbursed three lacs of rupees,\r\nthat is, thirty-four thousand five hundred pounds, in secret\r\nservices,--which having, he says, \"been advanced from _my own private\r\ncash_, I request that the same may be repaid to me in the following\r\nmanner.\" He accordingly desires three bonds, for a lac of Sicca rupees\r\neach, to be given to him in two of the Company's subscriptions,--one to\r\nbear interest on the eight per cent loan, the other two in the four per\r\ncent: the bonds were antedated to the beginning of the preceding\r\nOctober. On the 9th of the same month, that is, on the 9th of January,\r\n1781, the three bonds were accordingly ordered.[29] So far the whole\r\ntransaction appears clear, and of a piece. Private money is subscribed,\r\nand a public security is taken for it. When the Company's Treasury\r\naccounts[30] are compared with the proceedings of their Council-General,\r\na perfect correspondence also appears. The three bonds are then [there?]\r\nentered to Mr. Hastings, and he is credited for principal and interest\r\non them, in the exact terms of the order. So far the official\r\naccounts,--which, because of their perfect harmony, are considered as\r\nclear and consistent evidence to one body of fact.\r\n\r\nThe second sort of document relative to these bonds (though the first in\r\norder of time) is Mr. Hastings's letter of the 29th of November,\r\n1780.[31] It is written between the time of the expenditure of the money\r\nfor the Company's use and the taking of the bonds. Here, for the first\r\ntime, a very material difference appears; and the difference is the more\r\nstriking, because Mr. Hastings claimed the _whole_ money as his own, and\r\ntook bonds for it as such, _after_ this representation. The letter to\r\nthe Company discovers that part of the money (the whole of which he had\r\ndeclared on record to be his own, and for which he had taken bonds) was\r\nnot his, but the property of his masters, from whom he had taken the\r\nsecurity. It is no less remarkable that the letter which represents the\r\nmoney as belonging to the Company was written about six weeks before the\r\nMinute of Council in which he claims that money as his own. It is this\r\nletter on which your Committee is to remark.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, after giving his reasons for the application of the three\r\nlacs of rupees, and for his having for some time concealed the fact,\r\nsays, \"Two thirds of that sum I have raised _by my own credit_, and\r\nshall charge it in my official account; _the other third_ I have\r\nsupplied from the cash in my hands belonging to the Honorable\r\nCompany.\"[32]\r\n\r\nThe House will observe, that in November he tells the Directors that he\r\nshall charge only _two thirds_ in his official accounts; in the\r\nfollowing January he charges the _whole_.[33] For the other third,\r\nalthough he admitted that to belong to the Company, we have seen that he\r\ntakes a bond to _himself_.\r\n\r\nIt is material that he tells the Company in his letter that these two\r\nlacs of rupees were _raised on his credit_. His letter to the Council\r\nsays that they were advanced from his _private cash_. What he raises on\r\nhis credit may, on a fair construction, be considered as his own: but in\r\nthis, too, he fails; for it is certain he has never transferred these\r\nbonds to any creditor; nor has he stated any sum he has paid, or for\r\nwhich he stands indebted, on that account, to any specific person.\r\nIndeed, it was out of his power; for the first two thirds of the money,\r\nwhich he formerly stated as raised upon his credit, he now confesses to\r\nhave been from the beginning the Company's property, and therefore could\r\nnot have been raised on his private credit, or borrowed from any person\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nTo these two accounts, thus essentially varying, he has added a\r\nthird,[34] varying at least as essentially from both. In his last or\r\nthird account, which is a statement of all the sums he has received in\r\nan extraordinary manner, and confessed to be the Company's property, he\r\nreverses the items of his first account, and, instead of allowing the\r\nCompany but one third and claiming two thirds for himself, he enters two\r\nof the bonds, each for a lac of rupees, as belonging to the Company: of\r\nthe third bond, which appears so distinctly in the Consultations and in\r\nthe Treasury accounts, not one word is said; ten thousand pounds is\r\nabsorbed, sinks, and disappears at once, and no explanation whatsoever\r\nconcerning it is given; Mr. Hastings seems not yet to have decided to\r\nwhose account it ought to be placed. In this manner his debt to the\r\nCompany, or the Company's to him, is just what he thinks fit. In a\r\nsingle article he has varied three times. In one account he states the\r\nwhole to be his own; in another he claims two thirds; in the last he\r\ngives up the claim of the two thirds, and says nothing to the remaining\r\nportion.\r\n\r\nTo make amends, however, for the suppression of this third bond, given\r\nwith the two others in January, 1781, and antedated to the beginning of\r\nOctober, Mr. Hastings, in the above-mentioned general account subjoined\r\nto his letter of the 22d May, 1782, has brought to the Company's credit\r\na new bond.[35]\r\n\r\nThis bond is for 17,000_l._ It was taken from the Company (and so it\r\nappears on their Treasury accounts) on the 23d of November, 1780. He\r\ntook no notice of this, when, in January following, he called upon his\r\nown Council for the three others. What is more extraordinary, he was\r\nequally silent with regard to it, when, only six days after its date, he\r\nwrote concerning the subject of the three other bonds to the Court of\r\nDirectors; yet now it comes out, that that bond also was taken by Mr.\r\nHastings from the Company for money which he declares he had received on\r\nthe Company's account, and that he entered himself as creditor when he\r\nought to have made himself debtor.\r\n\r\nYour Committee examined Major Scott concerning this money, which Mr.\r\nHastings must have obtained in some clandestine and irregular mode; but\r\nthey could obtain no information of the persons from whom it was taken,\r\nnor of the occasion or pretence of taking this large sum; nor does any\r\nMinute of Council appear for its application to any service. The whole\r\nof the transaction, whatever it was, relative to this bond, is covered\r\nwith the thickest obscurity.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, to palliate the blame of his conduct, declares that he\r\nhas not received any interest on these bonds,--and that he has indorsed\r\nthem as not belonging to himself, but to the Company.[36] As to the\r\nfirst part of this allegation, whether he received the interest or let\r\nit remain in arrear is a matter of indifference, as he entitled himself\r\nto it; and so far as the legal security he has taken goes, he may,\r\nwhenever he pleases, dispose both of principal and interest. What he has\r\nindorsed on the bonds, or when he made the indorsement, or whether in\r\nfact he has made it at all, are matters known only to himself; for the\r\nbonds must be in his possession, and are nowhere by him stated to be\r\ngiven up or cancelled,--which is a thing very remarkable, when he\r\nconfesses that he had no right to receive them.\r\n\r\nThese bonds make but a part of the account of private receipts of money\r\nby Mr. Hastings, formerly paid into the Treasury as his own property,\r\nand now allowed not to be so. This account brings into view other very\r\nremarkable matters of a similar nature and description.[37]\r\n\r\nIn the public records, a sum of not less than 23,871_l._ is set to his\r\ncredit as a _deposit_ for his private account, paid in by him into the\r\nTreasury in gold, and coined at the Company's mint.[38] This appears in\r\nthe account furnished to the Directors, under the date of May, 1782, not\r\nto be lawfully his money, and he therefore transfers it to the Company's\r\ncredit: it still remains as a deposit.[39]\r\n\r\nThat the House may be apprised of the nature of this article of\r\ndeposit, it may not be improper to state that the Company receive into\r\ntheir treasury the cash of private persons, placed there as in a bank.\r\nOn this no interest is paid, and the party depositing has a right to\r\nreceive it upon demand. Under this head of account no public money is\r\never entered. Mr. Hastings, neither at making the deposit as his own,\r\nnor at the time of his disclosure of the real proprietor, (which he\r\nmakes to be the Company,) has given any information of the persons from\r\nwhom this money had been received. Mr. Scott was applied to by your\r\nCommittee, but could not give any more satisfaction in this particular\r\nthan in those relative to the bonds.\r\n\r\nThe title of the account of the 22d of May purports not only that those\r\nsums were paid into the Company's treasury by Mr. Hastings's order, but\r\nthat they were applied to the Company's service. No service is\r\nspecified, directly or by any reference, to which this great sum of\r\nmoney has been applied.\r\n\r\nTwo extraordinary articles follow this, in the May account, amounting to\r\nabout 29,000_l._[40] These articles are called Receipts for Durbar\r\nCharges. The general head of Durbar Charges, made by persons in office,\r\nwhen analyzed into the particulars, contains various expenses, including\r\nbounties and presents made by government, chiefly in the foreign\r\ndepartment. But in the last account he confesses that this sum also is\r\nnot his, but the Company's property; but as in all the rest, so in this,\r\nhe carefully conceals the means by which he acquired the money, the time\r\nof his taking it, and the persons from whom it was taken. This is the\r\nmore extraordinary, because, in looking over the journals and ledgers\r\nof the Treasury, the presents received and carried to the account of the\r\nCompany (which were generally small and complimental) were precisely\r\nentered, with the name of the giver.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, on turning to the account of Durbar charges in the\r\nledger of that month, find the sum, as stated in the account of May 22d,\r\nto be indeed paid in; but there is no specific application whatsoever\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nThe account of the whole money thus clandestinely received, as stated on\r\nthe 22d of May, 1782, (and for a great part of which Mr. Hastings to\r\nthat time took credit for, and for the rest has accounted in an\r\nextraordinary manner as his own,) amounts in the whole to upwards of\r\nninety-three thousand pounds sterling: a vast sum to be so obtained, and\r\nso loosely accounted for! If the money taken from the Rajah of Benares\r\nbe added, (as it ought,) it will raise the sum to upwards of\r\n116,000_l._; if the 11,600_l._ bond in October be added, it will be\r\nupwards of 128,000_l._ received in a secret manner by Mr. Hastings in\r\nabout one year and five months. To all these he adds another sum of one\r\nhundred thousand pounds, received as a present from the Subah of Oude.\r\nTotal, upwards of 228,000_l._\r\n\r\nYour Committee find that this last is the only sum the giver of which\r\nMr. Hastings has thought proper to declare. It is to be observed, that\r\nhe did not receive this 100,000_l._ in money, but in bills on a great\r\nnative money-dealer resident at Benares, and who has also an house at\r\nCalcutta: he is called Gopâl Dâs. The negotiation of these bills tended\r\nto make a discovery not so difficult as it would have been in other\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the application of this last sum of money, which is said\r\nto be carried to the Durbar charges of April, 1782, your Committee are\r\nnot enabled to make any observations on it, as the account of that\r\nperiod has not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nYour Committee have, in another Report, remarked fully upon most of the\r\ncircumstances of this extraordinary transaction. Here they only bring so\r\nmuch of these circumstances again into view as may serve to throw light\r\nupon the true nature of the sums of money taken by British subjects in\r\npower, under the name of _presents_, and to show how far they are\r\nentitled to that description in any sense which can fairly imply in the\r\npretended donors either willingness or ability to give. The condition of\r\nthe bountiful parties who are not yet discovered may be conjectured from\r\nthe state of those who have been made known: as far as that state\r\nanywhere appears, their generosity is found in proportion, not to the\r\nopulence they possess or to the favors they receive, but to the\r\nindigence they feel and the insults they are exposed to. The House will\r\nparticularly attend to the situation of the principal giver, the Subah\r\nof Oude.\r\n\r\n\"When the knife,\" says he, \"had penetrated to the bone, and I was\r\nsurrounded with such heavy distresses that I could no longer live in\r\nexpectations, I wrote you an account of my difficulties.\r\n\r\n\"The answer which I have received to it is such that it has given me\r\ninexpressible grief and affliction. I never had the least idea or\r\nexpectation from you and the Council that you would ever have given your\r\norders in so afflicting a manner, in which you never before wrote, and\r\nwhich I could not have imagined. As I am resolved to _obey_ your orders,\r\nand directions of the Council, without any delay, as long as I live, I\r\nhave, agreeably to those _orders_, delivered up _all my private papers_\r\nto him [the Resident], that, when he shall have examined my receipts and\r\nexpenses, _he may take whatever remains_. As I know it to be my duty to\r\nsatisfy you, the Company, and Council, I have not failed to _obey_ in\r\nany instance, but requested of him that it might be done so as not to\r\n_distress me in my necessary expenses_: there being no other funds but\r\nthose for the expenses of my mutseddies, household expenses, and\r\nservants, &c. He demanded these in such a manner, that, being\r\n_remediless_, I was obliged to comply with what he required. He has\r\naccordingly _stopped the pensions of my old servants for thirty years,\r\nwhether sepoys, mutseddies, or household servants, and the expenses of\r\nmy family and kitchen, together with the jaghires of my grandmother,\r\nmother, and aunts, and of my brothers and dependants, which were for\r\ntheir support_. I had raised thirteen hundred horse and three battalions\r\nof sepoys to attend upon me; but as I have no resources to support them,\r\nI have been obliged to remove the people stationed in the mahals\r\n[districts] and to send his people [the Resident's people] into the\r\nmahals, so that I have not now one single servant about me. Should I\r\nmention to what further difficulties I have been reduced, it would lay\r\nme open to contempt.\"\r\n\r\nIn other parts of this long remonstrance, as well as in other\r\nremonstrances no less serious, he says, \"that it is difficult for him to\r\nsave himself alive; that in all his affairs _Mr. Hastings had given full\r\npowers to the gentlemen here_,\" (meaning the English Resident and\r\nAssistants,) \"_who have done whatever they chose, and still continue to\r\ndo it_. I never expected that _you_ would have brought me into such\r\napprehension, and into so weak a state, without _writing to me on any\r\none of those subjects_; since I have not the smallest connection with\r\nanybody except yourself. I am in such distress, both day and night, that\r\nI see not the smallest prospect of deliverance from it, since you are so\r\ndispleased with me _as not to honor me with a single letter_.\"\r\n\r\nIn another remonstrance he thus expresses himself. \"The affairs of this\r\nworld are unstable, and soon pass away: it would therefore be incumbent\r\non the _English_ gentlemen to show _some_ friendship for me in my\r\n_necessities_,--I, who have always exerted my very life in the service\r\nof the English, _assigned over to them all the resources left in my\r\ncountry_, stopped my very household expenses, together with the jaghires\r\nof my servants and dependants, to the amount of 98,98,375 rupees.\r\nBesides this, as to the jaghires of my grandmother, mother, and uncle,\r\nwhich were granted to them for their support, _agreeable to\r\nengagements_, you are the _masters_,--if the Council have sent orders\r\nfor the stopping their jaghires also, stop them. I have no resources\r\nleft in my country, and have no friends by me, being even distressed in\r\nmy daily subsistence. I have some elephants, horses, and the houses\r\nwhich I inhabit: if they can be of any service to my friends, they are\r\nready. Whenever you can discover any resources, seize upon them: I shall\r\nnot interfere to prevent you. In my present distress for my daily\r\nexpenses, I was in hopes that they would have excused some part of my\r\ndebt. Of what use is it for me to relate my situation, which is known to\r\nthe whole world? This much is sufficient.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth of all these representations is nowhere contested by Mr.\r\nHastings. It is, indeed, admitted in something stronger than words;\r\nfor, upon account of the Nabob's condition, and the no less distressed\r\ncondition of his dominions, he thought it fit to withdraw from him and\r\nthem a large body of the Company's troops, together with all the English\r\nof a civil description, who were found no less burdensome than the\r\nmilitary. This was done on the declared inability of the country any\r\nlonger to support them,--a country not much inferior to England in\r\nextent and fertility, and, till lately at least, its equal in population\r\nand culture.\r\n\r\nIt was to a prince, in a state so far remote from freedom, authority,\r\nand opulence, so penetrated with the treatment he had received, and the\r\nbehavior he had met with from Mr. Hastings, that Mr. Hastings has chosen\r\nto attribute a disposition so very generous and munificent as, of his\r\nown free grace and mere motion, to make him a present, at one donation,\r\nof upwards of one hundred thousand pounds sterling. This vast private\r\ndonation was given at the moment of vast instant demands severely\r\nexacted on account of the Company, and accumulated on immense debts to\r\nthe same body,--and all taken from a ruined prince and almost desolated\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings has had the firmness, with all possible ease and apparent\r\nunconcern, to request permission from the Directors to legalize this\r\nforbidden present for his own use. This he has had the courage to do at\r\na time when he had abundant reason to look for what he has since\r\nreceived,--their censure for many material parts of his conduct towards\r\nthe people from whose wasted substance this pretended free gift was\r\ndrawn. He does not pretend that he has reason to expect the smallest\r\ndegree of partiality, in this or any other point, from the Court of\r\nDirectors. For, besides his complaint, first stated, of having never\r\npossessed their confidence, in a late letter[41] (in which,\r\nnotwithstanding the censures of Parliament, he magnifies his own\r\nconduct) he says, that, in all the long period of his service, \"he has\r\nalmost unremittedly wanted the support which all his predecessors had\r\nenjoyed from their constituents. From mine,\" says he, \"I have received\r\n_nothing but reproach, hard_ epithets, _and indignities_, instead of\r\nrewards and encouragement.\" It must therefore have been from some other\r\nsource of protection than that which the law had placed over him that he\r\nlooked for countenance and reward in violating an act of Parliament\r\nwhich forbid him from _taking gifts or presents on any account\r\nwhatsoever_,--much less a gift of this magnitude, which, from the\r\ndistress of the giver, must be supposed the effect of the most cruel\r\nextortion.\r\n\r\nThe Directors did wrong in their orders to appropriate money, which they\r\nmust know could not have been acquired by the consent of the pretended\r\ndonor, to their own use.[42] They acted more properly in refusing to\r\nconfirm this grant to Mr. Hastings, and in choosing rather to refer him\r\nto the law which he had violated than to his own sense of what he\r\nthought he was entitled to take from the natives: putting him in mind\r\nthat the Regulating Act had expressly declared \"that no\r\nGovernor-General, or any of the Council, shall, directly or indirectly,\r\naccept, receive, or take, of or from any person or persons, or on any\r\naccount whatsoever, any present, gift, donation, gratuity, or reward,\r\npecuniary or otherwise, or any promise or engagement for any of the\r\naforesaid.\" Here is no reserve for the case of a disclosure to the\r\nDirectors, and for the legalizing the breach of an act of Parliament by\r\ntheir subsequent consent. The illegality attached to the action at its\r\nvery commencement, and it could never be afterwards legalized: the\r\nDirectors had no such power reserved to them. Words cannot be devised of\r\na stronger import or studied with more care. To these words of the act\r\nare opposed the declaration and conduct of Mr. Hastings, who, in his\r\nletter of January, 1782, thinks fit to declare, that \"an offer of a very\r\nconsiderable sum of money was made to him, both on the part of the Nabob\r\nand his ministers, as _a present_, which he _accepted without\r\nhesitation_.\" The plea of his pretended necessity is of no avail. The\r\npresent was not in ready money, nor, as your Committee conceive,\r\napplicable to his immediate necessities. Even his credit was not\r\nbettered by bills at long periods; he does not pretend that he raised\r\nany money upon them; nor is it conceivable that a banker at Benares\r\nwould be more willing to honor the drafts of so miserable, undone, and\r\ndependent a person as the Nabob of Oude than those of the\r\nGovernor-General of Bengal, which might be paid either on the receipt of\r\nthe Benares revenue, or at the seat of his power, and of the Company's\r\nexchequer. Besides, it is not explicable, upon any grounds that can be\r\navowed, why the Nabob, who could afford to give these bills as _a\r\npresent_ to Mr. Hastings, could not have equally given them in discharge\r\nof the debt which he owed to the Company. It is, indeed, very much to be\r\nfeared that the people of India find it sometimes turn more to their\r\naccount to give presents to the English in authority than to pay their\r\ndebts to the public; and this is a matter of a very serious\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nNo small merit is made by Mr. Hastings, and that, too, in a high and\r\nupbraiding style, of his having come to a voluntary discovery of this\r\nand other unlawful practices of the same kind. \"That honorable court,\"\r\nsays Mr. Hastings, addressing himself to his masters, in his letter of\r\nDecember, 1782, \"ought to know whether I possess the integrity and honor\r\nwhich are the first requisites of such a station. If I wanted these,\r\nthey have afforded me too powerful incentives to suppress the\r\ninformation which I now convey to them through you, and to appropriate\r\nto my own use the sums which I have already passed to their credit, by\r\ntheir _unworthy_, and pardon me if I add _dangerous reflections_, which\r\nthey have passed upon me for the first communication of this kind\"; and\r\nhe immediately adds, what is singular and striking, and savors of a\r\nrecriminatory insinuation, \"_and your own experience_ will suggest to\r\nyou that there are persons who would profit by such a warning.\"[43] To\r\nwhat Directors in particular this imputation of experience is applied,\r\nand what other persons they are in whom _experience_ has shown a\r\ndisposition to profit of such a warning, is a matter highly proper to be\r\ninquired into. What Mr. Hastings says further on this subject is no less\r\nworthy of attention:--\"_that he could have concealed these transactions,\r\nif he had a wrong motive, from theirs and the public eye forever_.\"[44]\r\nIt is undoubtedly true, that, whether the observation be applicable to\r\nthe particular case or not, practices of this corrupt nature are\r\nextremely difficult of detection anywhere, but especially in India; but\r\nall restraint upon that grand fundamental abuse of presents is gone\r\nforever, if the servants of the Company can derive safety from a\r\ndefiance of the law, when they can no longer hope to screen themselves\r\nby an evasion of it. All hope of reformation is at an end, if, confiding\r\nin the force of a faction among Directors or proprietors to bear them\r\nout, and possibly to vote them the fruit of their crimes as a reward of\r\ntheir discovery, they find that their bold avowal of their offences is\r\nnot only to produce indemnity, but to be rated for merit. If once a\r\npresumption is admitted, that, wherever something is divulged, nothing\r\nis hid, the discovering of one offence may become the certain means of\r\nconcealing a multitude of others. The contrivance is easy and trivial,\r\nand lies open to the meanest proficient in this kind of art; it will not\r\nonly become an effectual cover to such practices, but will tend\r\ninfinitely to increase them. In that case, sums of money will be taken\r\nfor the purpose of discovery and making merit with the Company, and\r\nother sums will be taken for the private advantage of the receiver.\r\n\r\nIt must certainly be impossible for the natives to know what presents\r\nare for one purpose, or what for the other. It is not for a Gentoo or a\r\nMahometan landholder at the foot of the remotest mountains in India, who\r\nhas no access to our records and knows nothing of our language, to\r\ndistinguish what lacs of rupees, which he has given _eo nomine_ as a\r\npresent to a Company's servant, are to be authorized by his masters in\r\nLeadenhall Street as proper and legal, or carried to their public\r\naccount at their pleasure, and what are laid up for his own emolument.\r\n\r\nThe legislature, in declaring all presents to be the property of the\r\nCompany, could not consider corruption, extortion, and fraud as any part\r\nof their resources. The property in such presents was declared to be\r\ntheirs, not as a fund for their benefit, but in order to found a legal\r\ntitle to a civil suit. It was declared theirs, to facilitate the\r\nrecovery out of corrupt and oppressive hands of money illegally taken;\r\nbut this legal fiction of property could not nor ought by the\r\nlegislature to be considered in any other light than as a trust held by\r\nthem for those who suffered the injury. Upon any other construction, the\r\nCompany would have a right, first, to extract money from the subjects or\r\ndependants of this kingdom committed to their care, by means of\r\nparticular conventions, or by taxes, by rents, and by monopolies; and\r\nwhen they had exhausted every contrivance of public imposition, then\r\nthey were to be at liberty to let loose upon the people all their\r\nservants, from the highest rank to the lowest, to prey upon them at\r\npleasure, and to draw, by personal and official authority, by influence,\r\nvenality, and terror, whatever was left to them,--and that all this was\r\njustified, provided the product was paid into the Company's exchequer.\r\n\r\nThis prohibition and permission of presents, with this declaration of\r\nproperty in the Company, would leave no property to any man in India.\r\nIf, however, it should be thought that this clause in the act[45] should\r\nbe capable, by construction and retrospect, of so legalizing and thus\r\nappropriating these presents, (which your Committee conceive\r\nimpossible,) it is absolutely necessary that it should be very fully\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nThe provision in the act was made in favor of the natives. If such\r\nconstruction prevails, the provision made as their screen from\r\noppression will become the means of increasing and aggravating it\r\nwithout bounds and beyond remedy. If presents, which when they are given\r\nwere unlawful, can afterwards be legalized by an application of them to\r\nthe Company's service, no sufferer can even resort to a remedial process\r\nat law for his own relief. The moment he attempts to sue, the money may\r\nbe paid into the Company's treasury; it is then lawfully taken, and the\r\nparty is non-suited.\r\n\r\nThe Company itself must suffer extremely in the whole order and\r\nregularity of their public accounts, if the idea upon which Mr. Hastings\r\njustifies the taking of these presents receives the smallest\r\ncountenance. On his principles, the same sum may become private property\r\nor public, at the pleasure of the receiver; it is in his power, Mr.\r\nHastings says, to conceal it forever.[46] He certainly has it in his\r\npower not only to keep it back and bring it forward at his own times,\r\nbut even to shift and reverse the relations in the accounts (as Mr.\r\nHastings has done) in what manner and proportion seems good to him, and\r\nto make himself alternately debtor or creditor for the same sums.\r\n\r\nOf this irregularity Mr. Hastings himself appears in some degree\r\nsensible. He conceives it possible that his transactions of this nature\r\nmay to the Court of Directors seem unsatisfactory. He, however, puts it\r\nhypothetically: \"If to you,\" says he, \"who are accustomed to view\r\nbusiness in an _official and regular light, they should appear\r\nunprecedented, if not improper_.\"[47] He just conceives it possible that\r\nin an official money transaction the Directors may expect a proceeding\r\nofficial and regular. In what other lights than those which are official\r\nand regular matters of public account ought to be regarded by those who\r\nhave the charge of them, either in Bengal or in England, does not appear\r\nto your Committee. Any other is certainly \"unprecedented and improper,\"\r\nand can only serve to cover fraud both in the receipt and in the\r\nexpenditure. The acquisition of 58,000 rupees, or near 6000_l._, which\r\nappears in the sort of _unofficial and irregular account_ that he\r\nfurnishes of his presents, in his letter of May, 1782,[48] must appear\r\nextraordinary indeed to those who expect from men in office something\r\nofficial and something regular. \"This sum,\" says he, \"I received while I\r\nwas on my journey to Benares.\"[49] He tells it with the same careless\r\nindifference as if things of this kind were found by accident on the\r\nhigh-road.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings did not, indeed he could not, doubt that this unprecedented\r\nand improper account would produce much discussion. He says, \"Why these\r\nsums were taken by me, why they were (except the second) _quietly_\r\ntransferred to the Company's account, why bonds were taken for the first\r\nand not for the rest, might, were this matter to be exposed to the view\r\nof the public, _furnish a variety of conjectures_.\"[50]\r\n\r\nThis matter has appeared, and has furnished, as it ought to do,\r\nsomething more serious than conjectures. It would in any other case be\r\nsupposed that Mr. Hastings, expecting such inquiries, and considering\r\nthat the questions are (even as they are imperfectly stated by himself)\r\nfar from frivolous, would condescend to give some information upon\r\nthem; but the conclusion of a sentence so importantly begun, and which\r\nleads to such expectations, is, \"that to these conjectures it would be\r\nof little use to reply.\" This is all he says to public conjecture.\r\n\r\nTo the Court of Directors he is very little more complaisant, and not at\r\nall more satisfactory; he states merely as a supposition their inquiry\r\nconcerning matters of which he positively knew that they had called for\r\nan explanation. He knew it, because he presumed to censure them for\r\ndoing so. To the hypothesis of a further inquiry he gives a conjectural\r\nanswer of such a kind as probably, in an account of a doubtful\r\ntransaction, and to a superior, was never done before.\r\n\r\n\"_Were_ your Honorable Court to question me upon these points, I _would_\r\nanswer, that the sums were taken for the Company's benefit, at times in\r\nwhich the Company very much stood in need of them; that I _either_ chose\r\nto conceal the first receipts from public curiosity by receiving bonds\r\nfor the amount, or _possibly acted without any studied design_ which my\r\nmemory could at this distance of time verify.\"[51]\r\n\r\nHe here professes not to be certain of the motives by which he was\r\nhimself actuated in so extraordinary a concealment, and in the use of\r\nsuch extraordinary means to effect it; and as if the acts in question\r\nwere those of an absolute stranger, and not his own, he gives various\r\nloose conjectures concerning the motive to them. He even supposes, in\r\ntaking presents contrary to law, and in taking bonds for them as his\r\nown, contrary to what he admits to be truth and fact, that he might have\r\nacted without any distinct motive at all, or at least such as his\r\nmemory could reach at that distance of time. That immense distance, in\r\nthe faintness of which his recollection is so completely lost as to set\r\nhim guessing at his motives for his own conduct, was from the 15th of\r\nJanuary, 1781, when the bonds at his own request were given, to the date\r\nof this letter, which is the 22d of May, 1782,--that is to say, about\r\none year and four months.\r\n\r\nAs to the other sums, for which no bond was taken, the ground for the\r\ndifference in his explanation is still more extraordinary: he says, \"I\r\ndid not think it worth my care to observe the same means with _the\r\nrest_.\"[52] The rest of these sums, which were not worth his care, are\r\nstated in his account to be greater than those he was so solicitous (for\r\nsome reason which he cannot guess) to cover under bonds: these sums\r\namount to near 53,000_l._; whereas the others did not much exceed\r\n40,000_l._ For these actions, attended with these explanations, he\r\nventures to appeal to their (the Directors') breasts for a candid\r\ninterpretation, and \"he assumes the freedom to add, that he thinks\r\nhimself, on _such_ a subject, and on _such_ an occasion, entitled to\r\nit\";[53] and then, as if he had performed some laudable exploit, in the\r\naccompanying letter he glories in the integrity of his conduct; and\r\nanticipating his triumph over injustice, and the applauses which at a\r\nfuture time he seems confident he shall receive, says he, \"The applause\r\nof my own breast is my surest reward: your applause and that of my\r\ncountry is my next wish in life.\"[54] He declares in that very letter\r\nthat he had not _at any time_ possessed the confidence with them which\r\nthey never withheld from the meanest of his predecessors. With wishes so\r\nnear his heart perpetually disappointed, and, instead of applauses, (as\r\nhe tells us,) receiving nothing but reproaches and disgraceful epithets,\r\nhis steady continuance for so many years in their service, in a place\r\nobnoxious in the highest degree to suspicion and censure, is a thing\r\naltogether singular.\r\n\r\nIt appears very necessary to your Committee to observe upon the great\r\nleading principles which Mr. Hastings assumes, to justify the irregular\r\ntaking of these vast sums of money, and all the irregular means he had\r\nemployed to cover the greater part of it. These principles are the more\r\nnecessary to be inquired into, because, if admitted, they will serve to\r\njustify every species of improper conduct. His words are, \"that the\r\nsources from which these reliefs to the public service have come would\r\nnever have yielded them to the Company _publicly_; and that the\r\nexigencies of their service (exigencies created by the exposition of\r\ntheir affairs, and faction in their divided councils) required those\r\nsupplies.\"[55]\r\n\r\nAs to the first of these extraordinary positions, your Committee cannot\r\nconceive what motive could actuate any native of India dependent on the\r\nCompany, in assisting them privately, and in refusing to assist them\r\npublicly. If the transaction was fair and honest, every native must have\r\nbeen desirous of making merit with the great governing power. If he gave\r\nhis money as a free gift, he might value himself upon very honorable and\r\nvery acceptable service; if he lent it on the Company's bonds, it would\r\nstill have been of service, and he might also receive eight per cent\r\nfor his money. No native could, without some interested view, give to\r\nthe Governor-General what he would refuse to the Company as a grant, or\r\neven as a loan. It is plain that the powers of government must, in some\r\nway or other, be understood by the natives to be at sale. The\r\nGovernor-General says that he took the money with an original\r\ndestination to the purposes to which he asserts he has since applied it.\r\nBut this original destination was in his own mind only,--not declared,\r\nnor by him pretended to be declared, to the party who gave the presents,\r\nand who could perceive nothing in it but money paid to the supreme\r\nmagistrate for his private emolument. All that the natives could\r\npossibly perceive in such a transaction must be highly dishonorable to\r\nthe Company's government; for they must conceive, when they gave money\r\nto Mr. Hastings, that they bought from Mr. Hastings either what was\r\ntheir own right or something that was not so, or that they redeemed\r\nthemselves from some acts of rigor inflicted, threatened, or\r\napprehended. If, in the first case, Mr. Hastings gave them the object\r\nfor which they bargained, his act, however proper, was corrupt,--if he\r\ndid not, it was both corrupt and fraudulent; if the money was extorted\r\nby force or threats, it was oppressive and tyrannical. The very nature\r\nof such transactions has a tendency to teach the natives to pay a\r\ncorrupt court to the servants of the Company; and they must thereby be\r\nrendered less willing, or less able, or perhaps both, to fulfil their\r\nengagements to the state. Mr. Scott's evidence asserts that they would\r\nrather give to Mr. Hastings than lend to the Company. It is very\r\nprobable; but it is a demonstration of their opinion of his power and\r\ncorruption, and of the weak and precarious state of the Company's\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe second principle assumed by Mr. Hastings for his justification,\r\nnamely, that factious opposition and a divided government might create\r\nexigencies requiring such supplies, is full as dangerous as the first;\r\nfor, if, in the divisions which must arise in all councils, one member\r\nof government, when he thinks others factiously disposed, shall be\r\nentitled to take money privately from the subject for the purposes of\r\nhis politics, and thereby to dispense with an act of Parliament,\r\npretences for that end cannot be wanting. A dispute may always be raised\r\nin council in order to cover oppression and peculation elsewhere. But\r\nthese principles of Mr. Hastings tend entirely to destroy the character\r\nand functions of a council, and to vest them in one of the dissentient\r\nmembers. The law has placed the sense of the whole in the majority; and\r\nit is not a thing to be suffered, that any of the members should\r\nprivately raise money for the avowed purpose of defeating that sense, or\r\nfor promoting designs that are contrary to it: a more alarming\r\nassumption of power in an individual member of any deliberative or\r\nexecutive body cannot be imagined. Mr. Hastings had no right, in order\r\nto clear himself of peculation, to criminate the majority with faction.\r\nNo member of any body, outvoted on a question, has, or can have, a right\r\nto direct any part of his public conduct by that principle. The members\r\nof the Council had a common superior, to whom they might appeal in their\r\nmutual charges of faction: they did so frequently; and the imputation of\r\nfaction has almost always been laid on Mr. Hastings himself.\r\n\r\nBut there were periods, very distinguished periods too, in the records\r\nof the Company, in which the clandestine taking of money could not be\r\nsupported even by this pretence. Mr. Hastings has been charged with\r\nvarious acts of peculation, perpetrated at a time he could not excuse\r\nhimself by the plea of any public purpose to be carried on, or of any\r\nfaction in council by which it was traversed. It may be necessary here\r\nto recall to the recollection of the House, that, on the cry which\r\nprevailed of the ill practices of the Company's servants in India,\r\n(which general cry in a great measure produced the Regulating Act of\r\n1773,) the Court of Directors, in their instructions of the 29th of\r\nMarch, 1774, gave it as an injunction to the Council-General, that \"they\r\n_immediately_ cause the _strictest_ inquiry to be made into _all_\r\noppressions which may have been committed either against natives or\r\nEuropeans, and into _all_ abuses which may have prevailed in the\r\ncollection of the revenues or _any part of the civil government_ of the\r\nPresidency; and that you communicate to us _all information_ which you\r\nmay be able to obtain relative thereto, or any embezzlement or\r\ndissipation of the Company's money.\"\r\n\r\nIn this inquiry, by far the most important abuse which appeared on any\r\nof the above heads was that which was charged relative to the sale in\r\ngross by Mr. Hastings of nothing less than the whole authority of the\r\ncountry government in the disposal of the guardianship of the Nabob of\r\nBengal.\r\n\r\nThe present Nabob, Mobarek ul Dowlah, was a minor when he succeeded to\r\nthe title and office of Subahdar of the three provinces in 1770.\r\nAlthough in a state approaching to subjection, still his rank and\r\ncharacter were important. Much was necessarily to depend upon a person\r\nwho was to preserve the moderation of a sovereign not supported by\r\nintrinsic power, and yet to maintain the dignity necessary to carry on\r\nthe representation of political government, as well as the substance of\r\nthe whole criminal justice of a great country. A good education,\r\nconformably to the maxims of his religion and the manners of his people,\r\nwas necessary to enable him to fill that delicate place with reputation\r\neither to the Mahometan government or to ours. He had still to manage a\r\nrevenue not inconsiderable, which remained as the sole resource for the\r\nlanguishing dignity of persons any way distinguished in rank among\r\nMussulmen, who were all attached and clung to him. These considerations\r\nrendered it necessary to put his person and affairs into proper hands.\r\nThey ought to have been men who were able by the gravity of their rank\r\nand character to preserve his morals from the contagion of low and\r\nvicious company,--men who by their integrity and firmness might be\r\nenabled to resist in some degree the rapacity of Europeans, as well as\r\nto secure the remaining fragments of his property from the attempts of\r\nthe natives themselves, who must lie under strong temptation of taking\r\ntheir share in the last pillage of a decaying house.\r\n\r\nThe Directors were fully impressed with the necessity of such an\r\narrangement. Your Committee find, that, on the 26th of August, 1771,\r\nthey gave instructions to the President and Council to appoint \"a\r\nminister to transact the political affairs of the circar\r\n[government],--and to select for that purpose some person well qualified\r\nfor the affairs of government to be the minister of the government, and\r\nguardian of the Nabob's minority.\"\r\n\r\nThe order was so distinct as not to admit of a mistake; it was (for its\r\nmatter) provident and well considered; and the trust which devolved on\r\nMr. Hastings was of such a nature as might well stimulate a man\r\nsensible to reputation to fulfil it in a manner agreeably to the\r\ndirections he had received, and not only above just cause of exception,\r\nbut out of the reach of suspicion and malice. In that situation it was\r\nnatural to suppose he would cast his eyes upon men of the first repute\r\nand consideration among the Mussulmen of high rank.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, instead of directing his eyes to the durbar, employed his\r\nresearches in the seraglio. In the inmost recesses of that place he\r\ndiscovered a woman secluded from the intercourse and shut up from the\r\neyes of men, whom he found to correspond with the orders he had received\r\nfrom the Directors, as a person well \"qualified for the affairs of\r\ngovernment, fit to be a minister of government and the guardian of the\r\nNabob's minority.\" This woman he solemnly invests with these functions.\r\nHe appoints Rajah Gourdas, whom some time after he himself qualified\r\nwith a description of a young man of mean abilities, to be her duan, or\r\nsteward of the household. The rest of the arrangement was correspondent\r\nto this disposition of the principal offices.\r\n\r\nIt seems not to have been lawful or warrantable in Mr. Hastings to set\r\naside the arrangement positively prescribed by the Court of Directors,\r\nwhich evidently pointed to a man, not to any woman whatever. As a woman\r\nconfined in the female apartment, the lady he appointed could not be\r\ncompetent to hold or qualified to exercise any active employment: she\r\nstood in need of guardians for herself, and had not the ability for the\r\nguardianship of a person circumstanced as the Subah was. General\r\nClavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr. Francis declare in their minute,\r\n\"that they believe there never was an instance in India of such a trust\r\nso disposed of.\" Mr. Hastings has produced no precedent in answer to\r\nthis objection.\r\n\r\nIt will be proper to state to the House the situation and circumstances\r\nof the women principally concerned, who were in the seraglio of Jaffier\r\nAli Khân at his death. The first of these was called Munny Begum, a\r\nperson originally born of poor and obscure parents, who delivered her\r\nover to the conductress of a company of dancing girls; in which\r\nprofession being called to exhibit at a festival, the late Nabob took a\r\nliking to her, and, after some cohabitation, she obtained such influence\r\nover him that he took her for one of his wives and (she seems to have\r\nbeen the favorite) put her at the head of his harem; and having a son by\r\nher, this son succeeded to his authority and estate,--Munny Begum, the\r\nmother, being by his will a devisee of considerable sums of money, and\r\nother effects, on which he left a charge, which has since been applied\r\nto the service of the East India Company. The son of this lady dying,\r\nand a son by another wife succeeding, and dying also, the present Nabob,\r\nMobarek ul Dowlah, son by a third wife, succeeded. This woman was then\r\nalive, and in the seraglio.\r\n\r\nIt was Munny Begum that Mr. Hastings chose, and not the natural mother\r\nof the Nabob. Whether, having chosen a woman in defiance of the\r\nCompany's orders, and in passing by the natural parent of the minor\r\nprince, he was influenced by respect for the disposition made by the\r\ndeceased Nabob during his life, or by other motives, the House will\r\ndetermine upon a view of the facts which follow. It will be matter of\r\ninquiry, when the question is stated upon the appointment of a\r\nstepmother in exclusion of the parent, whether the usage of the East\r\nconstantly authorizes the continuance of that same distribution of rank\r\nand power which was settled in the seraglio during the life of a\r\ndeceased prince, and which was found so settled at his death, and\r\nafterwards, to the exclusion of the mother of the successor. In case of\r\nfemale guardianship, her claim seems to be a right of Nature, and which\r\nnothing but a very clear positive law will (if that can) authorize the\r\ndeparture from. The history of Munny Begum is stated on the records of\r\nthe Council-General, and no attempt made by Mr. Hastings to controvert\r\nthe truth of it.\r\n\r\nThat was charged by the majority of Council to have happened which might\r\nbe expected inevitably to happen: the care of the Nabob's education was\r\ngrossly neglected, and his fortune as grossly mismanaged and embezzled.\r\nWhat connection this waste and embezzlement had with the subsequent\r\nevents the House will judge.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of May, 1775, Mr. James Grant, accountant to the Provincial\r\nCouncil of Moorshedabad, produced to the Governor-General and Council\r\ncertain Persian papers which stated nine lacs of rupees (upwards of\r\nninety thousand pounds sterling) received by Munny Begum, on her\r\nappointment to the management of the Nabob's household, over and above\r\nthe balance due at that time, and not accounted for by her. These Grant\r\nhad received from Nuned Roy, who had been a writer in the Begum's\r\nTreasury Office. Both Mr. Grant and Nuned Roy were called before the\r\nboard, and examined respecting the authenticity of the papers. Among\r\nother circumstances tending to establish the credit of these papers, it\r\nappears that Mr. Grant offered to make oath that the chief eunuch of the\r\nBegum had come to him on purpose to prevail on him not to send the\r\npapers, and had declared _that the accounts were not to be disputed_.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of May it was resolved by a majority of the board, against\r\nthe opinion and solemn protest of the Governor-General, that a gentleman\r\nshould be sent up to the city of Moorshedabad to demand of Munny Begum\r\nthe accounts of the nizamut and household, from April, 1764, to the\r\nlatest period to which they could be closed, and to divest the Begum of\r\nthe office of guardian to the Nabob; and Mr. Charles Goring was\r\nappointed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe preceding facts are stated to the House, not as the foundation of an\r\ninquiry into the conduct of the Begum, but as they lead to and are\r\ntherefore necessary to explain by what means a discovery was made of a\r\nsum of money given by her to Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nMr. Goring's first letter from the city, dated 17th May, 1775, mentions,\r\namong other particulars, the young Nabob's joy at being delivered out of\r\nthe hands of Munny Begum, of the mean and indigent state of confinement\r\nin which he was kept by her, of the distress of his mother, and that he\r\nhad told Mr. Goring that the \"Begum's eunuch had instructed the servants\r\nnot to suffer him to learn anything by which he might make himself\r\nacquainted with business\": and he adds, \"Indeed, I believe there is\r\ngreat truth in it, as his Excellency seems to be ignorant of almost\r\neverything a man of his rank ought to know,--not from a want of\r\nunderstanding, but of being properly educated.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of May, Mr. Goring transmitted to the Governor-General and\r\nCouncil an account of sums given by the Begum under her seal, delivered\r\nto Mr. Goring by the Nabob in her apartments. The account is as follows.\r\n\r\n    Memorandum of Disbursements to English Gentlemen, from the\r\n    Nabob's Sircar, in the Bengal Year 1179.\r\n\r\n                                         +--------------------+\r\n                                         |Seal of Munny Begum,|\r\n                                         |Mother of the Nabob |\r\n                                         |Nudjuf ul Dowlah,   |\r\n                                         |deceased.           |\r\n                                         +--------------------+\r\n\r\n      To the Governor, Mr. Hastings, for an\r\n      entertainment                                  1,50,000\r\n\r\n      To Mr. Middleton, on account of an agreement\r\n      entered into by Baboo Begum                    1,50,000\r\n                                                     --------\r\n                                            Rupees   3,00,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this paper was delivered, the Governor-General moved that Mr.\r\nGoring might be asked _how he came by it_, and _on what account this\r\npartial selection was made by him_; also, that the Begum should be\r\ndesired _to explain the sum laid to his charge_, and that he should ask\r\n_the Nabob or the Begum their reasons for delivering this separate\r\naccount_.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the Governor's proposal was agreed to.\r\n\r\nMr. Goring's answer to this requisition of the board is as follows.\r\n\r\n\"In compliance with your orders to explain the delivery of the paper\r\ncontaining an account of three lacs of rupees, I am to inform you, it\r\ntook its rise from a message sent me by the Begum, requesting I would\r\ninterest myself with the Nabob to have Akbar Ali Khân released to her\r\nfor a few hours, having something of importance to communicate to me, on\r\nwhich she wished to consult him. Thinking the service might be benefited\r\nby it, I accordingly desired the Nabob would be pleased to deliver him\r\nto my charge, engaging to return him the same night,--which I did. I\r\nheard no more till next day, when the Begum requested to see his\r\nExcellency and myself, desiring Akbar Ali might attend.\r\n\r\n\"On our first meeting, she entered into a long detail of her\r\nadministration, endeavoring to represent it in the fairest light; at\r\nlast she came to the point, and told me, my urgent and repeated\r\nremonstrances to her to be informed how the balance arose of which I was\r\nto inquire induced her from memory to say what she had herself\r\ngiven,--then mentioning the sum of a lac and a half to the Governor to\r\nfeast him whilst he stayed there, and a lac and a half to Mr. Middleton\r\nby the hands of Baboo Begum. As I looked on this no more than a matter\r\nof conversation, I arose to depart, but was detained by the Begum's\r\nrequesting the Nabob to come to her. A scene of weeping and complaint\r\nthen began, which made me still more impatient to be gone, and I\r\nrepeatedly sent to his Excellency for that purpose: he at last came out\r\nand delivered me the paper I sent you, declaring it was given him by the\r\nBegum to be delivered me.\"\r\n\r\nMunny Begum also wrote a letter to General Clavering, in which she\r\ndirectly asserts the same. \"Mr. Goring has pressed me on the subject of\r\nthe balances; in answer to which I informed him, that all the\r\nparticulars, being on record, would in the course of the inquiry appear\r\nfrom the papers. He accordingly received from the Nabob Mobarek ul\r\nDowlah a list of three lacs of rupees given to the Governor and Mr.\r\nMiddleton. I now send you inclosed a list of the dates when it was\r\npresented, and through whose means, which you will receive.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General then desired that the following questions might be\r\nproposed to the Begum by Mr. Martin, then Resident at the Durbar.\r\n\r\n1st. Was any application made to you for the account which you have\r\ndelivered, of three lacs of rupees said to have been paid to the\r\nGovernor and Mr. Middleton, or did you deliver the account of your own\r\nfree will, and unsolicited?\r\n\r\n2d. In what manner was the application made to you, and by whom?\r\n\r\n3d. On what account was the sum of one and half lacs given to the\r\nGovernor-General, which you have laid to his account? Was it in\r\nconsequence of any requisition from him, or of any previous agreement,\r\nor of any established usage?\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General objected strongly to Mr. Goring's being present\r\nwhen the questions were put to the Begum; but it was insisted on by the\r\nmajority, and it was resolved accordingly, that he ought to be present.\r\nThe reasons on both sides will best appear by the copy of the debate,\r\ninserted in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe Begum's answer to the preceding questions, addressed to the\r\nGovernor-General and Council, where it touched the substance, was as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\"The case is this. Mr. Goring, on his arrival here, _seized all the\r\npapers, and secured them under his seal; and all the mutsuddies [clerks\r\nor accountants] attended him, and explained to him all the particulars\r\nof them_. Mr. Goring inquired of me concerning the arrears due to the\r\nsepoys, &c., observing, that the nizamut and bhela money [Nabob's\r\nallowance] was received from the Company; from whence, then, could the\r\nbalance arise? I made answer, that the sum was not adequate to the\r\nexpenses. Mr. Goring then asked, What are those expenses which exceed\r\nthe sum received from the Company? I replied, _All the particulars will\r\nbe found in the papers_. The affair of the three lacs of rupees, _on\r\naccount of entertainment for the Governor and Mr. Middleton_, has been,\r\nI am told, related to you by Rajah Gourdas; besides which there are many\r\nother expenses, which will appear from the papers. As the custom of\r\nentertainment is of long standing, and accordingly every Governor of\r\nCalcutta who came to Moorshedabad received a daily sum of two thousand\r\nrupees for entertainment, which, was in fact instead of provisions; and\r\nthe lac and an half of rupees laid to Mr. Middleton's charge was _a\r\npresent on account of an agreement entered into by the Bhow Begum_. I\r\ntherefore affixed my seal to the account, and forwarded it to Mr. Goring\r\nby means of the Nabob.\"\r\n\r\nIn this answer, the accounts given to Mr. Goring she asserts to be\r\ngenuine. They are explained, in all the particulars, by all the\r\nsecretaries and clerks in office. They are secured under Mr. Goring's\r\nseal. To them she refers for everything; to them she refers for the\r\nthree lacs of rupees given to Mr. Hastings and Mr. Middleton. It is\r\nimpossible to combine together a clearer body of proof, composed of\r\nrecord of office and verbal testimony mutually supporting and\r\nillustrating each other.\r\n\r\nThe House will observe that the receipt of the money is indirectly\r\nadmitted by one of the Governor's own questions to Munny Begum.\r\n\r\nIf the money was not received, it would have been absurd to ask _on what\r\naccount it was given_. Both the question and the answer relate to some\r\nestablished usage, the appeal to which might possibly be used to justify\r\nthe acceptance of the money, if it was accepted, but would be\r\nsuperfluous, and no way applicable to the charge, if the money was never\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nOn this point your Committee will only add, that, in all the controversy\r\nbetween Mr. Hastings and the majority of the Council, he _nowhere denies\r\nthe receipt of this money_. In his letter to the Court of Directors of\r\nthe 31st of July, 1775, he says that the Begum was compelled by the ill\r\ntreatment of one of her servants, which he calls _a species of torture_,\r\nto deliver the paper to Mr. Goring; but he nowhere affirms that the\r\ncontents of the paper were false.\r\n\r\nOn this conduct the majority remark, \"We confess it appears very\r\nextraordinary that Mr. Hastings should employ so much time and labor to\r\nshow that the discoveries against him have been obtained by improper\r\nmeans, but that he should take no step whatsoever _to invalidate the\r\ntruth of them_. He does not deny the receipt of the money: the Begum's\r\nanswers to the questions put to her at his own desire make it impossible\r\nthat he should deny it. It seems, he has formed some plan of defence\r\nagainst this and similar charges, which he thinks will avail him in a\r\ncourt of justice, and which it would be imprudent in him to anticipate\r\nat this time. If he has not received the money, we see no reason for\r\nsuch a guarded and cautious method of proceeding. An innocent man would\r\ntake a shorter and easier course. He would voluntarily exculpate\r\nhimself by his oath.\"\r\n\r\nYour Committee entertain doubts whether the refusal to exculpate by oath\r\ncan be used as a circumstance to infer any presumption of guilt. But\r\nwhere the charge is direct, specific, circumstantial, supported by\r\npapers and verbal testimony, made before his lawful superiors, to whom\r\nhe was accountable, by persons competent to charge, if innocent, he was\r\nobliged at least to oppose to it a clear and formal denial of the fact,\r\nand to make a demand for inquiry. But if he does not deny the fact, and\r\neludes inquiry, just presumptions will be raised against him.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, willing to go to the bottom of a mode of corruption deep\r\nand dangerous in the act and the example, being informed that Mr. Goring\r\nwas in London, resolved to examine him upon the subject. Mr. Goring not\r\nonly agreed with all the foregoing particulars, but even produced to\r\nyour Committee what he declared to be the original Persian papers in his\r\nhands, delivered from behind the curtain through the Nabob himself, who,\r\nhaving privilege, as a son-in-law, to enter the women's apartment,\r\nreceived them from Munny Begum as authentic,--the woman all the while\r\nlamenting the loss of her power with many tears and much vociferation.\r\nShe appears to have been induced to make discovery of the above\r\npractices in order to clear herself of the notorious embezzlement of the\r\nNabob's effects.\r\n\r\nYour Committee examining Mr. Scott and Mr. Baber on this subject, they\r\nalso produced a Persian paper, which Mr. Baber said he had received from\r\nthe hands of a servant of Munny Begum,--and along with it a paper\r\npurporting to be a translation into English of the Persian original. In\r\nthe paper given as the translation, Munny Begum is made to allege many\r\nmatters of hardship and cruelty against Mr. Goring, and an attempt to\r\ncompel her to make out a false account, but does not at all deny the\r\ngiving the money: very far from it. She is made to assert, indeed, \"that\r\nMr. Goring desired her to put down three lacs of rupees, as divided\r\nbetween Mr. Hastings and Mr. Middleton. I begged to be excused,\r\nobserving to him that this money had neither been tendered or _accepted_\r\nwith any criminal or improper view.\" After some lively expressions in\r\nthe European manner, she says, \"that it had been customary to furnish a\r\ntable for the Governor and his attendants, during their stay at court.\r\nWith respect to the sum mentioned to Mr. Middleton, it was a _free gift_\r\nfrom my own _privy purse_. Purburam replied, he understood this money to\r\nbe paid to these gentlemen as a gratuity for _secret services_; and as\r\nsuch he should assuredly represent it.\" Here the payments to Mr.\r\nHastings are fully admitted, and excused as agreeable to usage, and for\r\nkeeping a table. The present to Mr. Middleton is justified as a free\r\ngift. The paper produced by Mr. Scott is not referred to by your\r\nCommittee as of any weight, but to show that it does not prove what it\r\nis produced to prove.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, on reading the paper delivered in by Mr. Scott as a\r\ntranslation, perceive it to be written in a style which they conceived\r\nwas little to be expected in a faithful translation from a Persian\r\noriginal, being full of quaint terms and idiomatic phrases, which\r\nstrongly bespeak English habits in the way of thinking, and of English\r\npeculiarities and affectations in the expression. Struck with these\r\nstrong internal marks of a suspicious piece, they turned to the Persian\r\nmanuscript produced by Mr. Scott and Mr. Baber, and comparing it with\r\nMr. Goring's papers, they found the latter carefully sealed upon every\r\nleaf, as they believe is the practice universal in all authentic pieces.\r\nThey found on the former no seal or signature whatsoever, either at the\r\ntop or bottom of the scroll. This circumstance of a want of signature\r\nnot only takes away all authority from the piece as evidence, but\r\nstrongly confirmed the suspicions entertained by your Committee, on\r\nreading the translation, of unwarrantable practices in the whole conduct\r\nof this business, even if the translation should be found substantially\r\nto agree with the original, such an original as it is. The Persian roll\r\nis in the custody of the clerk of your Committee for further\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nMr. Baber and Mr. Scott, being examined on these material defects in the\r\nauthentication of a paper produced by them as authentic, could give no\r\nsort of account how it happened to be without a signature; nor did Mr.\r\nBaber explain how he came to accept and use it in that condition.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, your Committee conceive that all the parts of the\r\ntransaction, as they appear in the Company's records, are consistent,\r\nand mutually throw light on each other.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Directors order the President and Council to appoint a\r\n_minister_ to transact the _political_ affairs of the government, and to\r\n_select_ for that purpose some person well qualified for the _affairs of\r\ngovernment_, and to be the _minister of government_. Mr. Hastings\r\nselects for the minister so described and so qualified a woman locked up\r\nin a seraglio. He is ordered to appoint a guardian to the Nabob's\r\nminority. Mr. Hastings passes by his natural parent, and appoints\r\nanother woman. These acts would of themselves have been liable to\r\nsuspicion. But a great deficiency or embezzlement soon appears in this\r\nwoman's account. To exculpate herself, she voluntarily declares that she\r\ngave a considerable sum to Mr. Hastings, who never once denies the\r\nreceipt. The account given by the principal living witness of the\r\ntransaction in his evidence is perfectly coherent, and consistent with\r\nthe recorded part. The original accounts, alleged to be delivered by the\r\nlady in question, were produced by him, properly sealed and\r\nauthenticated. Nothing is opposed to all this but a paper without\r\nsignature, and therefore of no authority, attended with a translation of\r\na very extraordinary appearance; and this paper, in apologizing for it,\r\nconfirms the facts beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\nFinally, your Committee examined the principal living witness of the\r\ntransaction, and find his evidence consistent with the record. Your\r\nCommittee received the original accounts, alleged to be delivered by the\r\nlady in question, properly sealed and authenticated, and find opposed to\r\nthem nothing but a paper without signature, and therefore of no\r\nauthority, attended with a translation of a very extraordinary\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the Directors ordered opinions to be taken on a prosecution:\r\nthey received one doubtful, and three positively for it.\r\n\r\nThey write, in their letter of 5th February, 1777, paragraphs 32 and\r\n33:--\r\n\r\n\"Although it is rather our wish to prevent evils in future than to enter\r\ninto a severe retrospection of the past, and, where facts are doubtful,\r\nor attended with alleviating circumstances, to proceed with lenity,\r\nrather than to prosecute with rigor,--yet some of the cases are so\r\nflagrantly corrupt, and others attended with circumstances so oppressive\r\nto the inhabitants, that it would be unjust to suffer the delinquents to\r\ngo unpunished. The principal facts[56] have been communicated to our\r\nsolicitor, whose report, confirmed by our standing counsel, we send you\r\nby the present conveyance,--authorizing you, at the same time, to take\r\nsuch steps as shall appear proper to be pursued.\r\n\r\n\"If we find it necessary, we shall return you the original covenants of\r\nsuch of our servants as remain in India, and have been anyways concerned\r\nin the undue receipt of money, in order to enable you to recover the\r\nsame for the use of the Company by a suit or suits at law, to be\r\ninstituted in the Supreme Court of Judicature in Bengal.\"\r\n\r\nYour Committee do not find that the covenants have been sent, or that\r\nany prosecution has been begun.\r\n\r\nA vast scene of further peculation and corruption, as well in this\r\nbusiness as in several other instances, appears in the evidence of the\r\nRajah Nundcomar. That evidence, and all the proceedings relating to it,\r\nare entered in the Appendix. It was the last evidence of the kind. The\r\ninformant was hanged. An attempt was made by Mr. Hastings to indict him\r\nfor a conspiracy; this failing of effect, another prosecutor appeared\r\nfor an offence not connected with these charges. Nundcomar, the object\r\nof that charge, was executed, at the very crisis of the inquiry, for an\r\noffence of another nature, not capital by the laws of the country. As\r\nlong as it appeared safe, several charges were made (which are inserted\r\nat large in the Appendix); and Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell seemed\r\napprehensive of many more. General Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr.\r\nFrancis declared, in a minute entered on the Consultations of the 5th\r\nMay, 1775, that, \"in the late proceedings of the Revenue Board, it will\r\nappear that there is no species of peculation from which the Honorable\r\nGovernor-General has thought proper to abstain.\" A charge of offences of\r\nso heinous a nature, so very extensive, so very deliberate, made on\r\nrecord by persons of great weight, appointed by act of Parliament his\r\nassociates in the highest trust,--a charge made at his own board, to his\r\nown face, and transmitted to their common superiors, to whom they were\r\njointly and severally accountable, this was not a thing to be passed\r\nover by Mr. Hastings; still less ought it to have perished in other\r\nhands. It ought to have been brought to an immediate and strict\r\ndiscussion. General Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr. Francis ought to\r\nhave been punished for a groundless accusation, if such it had been. If\r\nthe accusation were founded, Mr. Hastings was very unfit for the high\r\noffice of Governor-General, or for any office.\r\n\r\nAfter this comprehensive account by his colleagues of the\r\nGovernor-General's conduct, these gentlemen proceeded to the\r\nparticulars, and they produced the case of a corrupt bargain of Mr.\r\nHastings concerning the disposition of office. This transaction is here\r\nstated by your Committee in a very concise manner, being on this\r\noccasion merely intended to point out to the House the absolute\r\nnecessity which, in their opinion, exists for another sort of inquiry\r\ninto the corruptions of men in power in India than hitherto has been\r\npursued. The proceedings may be found at large in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nA complaint was made that Mr. Hastings had sold the office of Phousdar\r\nof Hoogly to a person called Khân Jehan Khân on a corrupt agreement,--which\r\nwas, that from his emoluments of seventy-two thousand rupees a\r\nyear he was to pay to the Governor-General thirty-six thousand rupees\r\nannually, and to his banian, Cantoo Baboo, four thousand more. The\r\ncomplainant offers to pay to the Company the forty thousand rupees which\r\nwere corruptly paid to these gentlemen, and to content himself with the\r\nallowance of thirty-two thousand. Mr. Hastings was, if on any occasion\r\nof his life, strongly called upon to bring this matter to the most\r\ndistinct issue; and Mr. Barwell, who supported his administration, and\r\nas such ought to have been tender for his honor, was bound to help him\r\nto get to the bottom of it, if his enemies should be ungenerous enough\r\nto countenance such an accusation, without permitting it to be detected\r\nand exposed. But the course they held was directly contrary. They began\r\nby an objection to receive the complaint, in which they obstinately\r\npersevered as far as their power went. Mr. Barwell was of opinion that\r\nthe Company's instructions to inquire into peculation were intended for\r\nthe public interests,--that it could not forward the public interests to\r\nenter into these inquiries,--and that \"he never would be a channel of\r\naspersing any character, while it cannot conduce to the good of\r\ngovernment.\" Here was a new mode of reasoning found out by Mr. Barwell,\r\nwhich might subject all inquiry into peculation to the discretion of\r\nthe very persons charged with it. By that reasoning all orders of his\r\nsuperiors were at his mercy; and he actually undertook to set aside\r\nthose commands which by an express act of Parliament he was bound to\r\nobey, on his opinion of what would or would not conduce to the good of\r\ngovernment. On his principles, he either totally annihilates the\r\nauthority of the act of Parliament, or he entertains so extravagant a\r\nsupposition as that the Court of Directors possessed a more absolute\r\nauthority, when their orders were not intended for the public good, than\r\nwhen they were.\r\n\r\nGeneral Clavering was of a different opinion. He thought \"he should be\r\nwanting to the legislature, and to the Court of Directors, if he was not\r\nto receive the complaints of the inhabitants, when properly\r\nauthenticated, and to prefer them to the board for investigation, as the\r\nonly means by which these grievances can be redressed, and the Company\r\ninformed of the conduct of their servants.\"\r\n\r\nTo these sentiments Colonel Monson and Mr. Francis adhered. Mr. Hastings\r\nthought it more safe, on principles similar to those assumed by Mr.\r\nBarwell, to refuse to hear the charge; but he reserved his remarks on\r\nthis transaction, because they will be equally applicable to _many\r\nothers which in the course of this business are likely to be brought\r\nbefore the board_. There appeared, therefore, to him a probability that\r\nthe charge about the corrupt bargain was no more than the commencement\r\nof a whole class of such accusations; since he was of opinion (and what\r\nis very extraordinary, previous to any examination) that the same\r\nremarks would be applicable to several of those which were to follow. He\r\nmust suppose this class of charges very uniform, as well as very\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\nThe majority, however, pressed their point; and notwithstanding his\r\nopposition to all inquiry, as he was supported only by Mr. Barwell, the\r\nquestion for it was carried. He was then desired to name a day for the\r\nappearance of the accuser, and the institution of the inquiry. Though\r\nbaffled in his attempt to stop the inquiry in the first stage, Mr.\r\nHastings made a second stand. He seems here to have recollected\r\nsomething inherent in his own office, that put the matter more in his\r\npower than at first he had imagined; for he speaks in a positive and\r\ncommanding tone: \"I will not,\" says his minute, \"name a day for Mir Zin\r\nul ab Dien to appear before the board; _nor will I suffer him to appear\r\nbefore the board_.\"\r\n\r\nThe question for the inquiry had been carried; it was declared fit to\r\ninquire; but there was, according to him, a power which might prevent\r\nthe appearance of witnesses. On the general policy of obstructing such\r\ninquiries, Mr. Francis, on a motion to that effect, made a sound remark,\r\nwhich cannot fail of giving rise to very serious thoughts: \"That,\r\nsupposing it agreed among ourselves that the board shall not hear any\r\ncharges or complaints against a member of it, a case or cases may\r\nhereafter happen, in which, by a reciprocal complaisance to each other,\r\nour respective misconduct may be effectually screened from inquiry; and\r\nthe Company, whose interest is concerned, or the parties who may have\r\nreason to complain of any one member individually, may be left without\r\nremedy.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barwell was not of the opinion of that gentleman, nor of the maker\r\nof the motion, General Clavering, nor of Mr. Monson, who supported it.\r\nHe entertains sentiments with regard to the orders of the Directors in\r\nthis particular perfectly correspondent with those which he had given\r\nagainst the original inquiry. He says, \"Though it may in some little\r\ndegree save the Governor-General from personal insult, where there is no\r\njudicial power lodged, that of inquisition can never answer any good\r\npurpose.\" This is doctrine of a most extraordinary nature and tendency,\r\nand, as your Committee conceive, contrary to every sound principle to be\r\nobserved in the constitution of judicatures and inquisitions. The power\r\nof inquisition ought rather to be wholly separated from the judicial,\r\nthe former being a previous step to the latter, which requires other\r\nrules and methods, and ought not, if possible, to be lodged in the same\r\nhands. The rest of his minute (contained in the Appendix) is filled with\r\na censure on the native inhabitants, with reflections on the ill\r\nconsequences which would arise from an attention to their complaints,\r\nand with an assertion of the authority of the Supreme Court, as\r\nsuperseding the necessity and propriety of such inquiries in Council.\r\nWith regard to his principles relative to the natives and their\r\ncomplaints, if they are admitted, they are of a tendency to cut off the\r\nvery principle of redress. The existence of the Supreme Court, as a\r\nmeans of relief to the natives under all oppressions, is held out to\r\nqualify a refusal to hear in the Council. On the same pretence, Mr.\r\nHastings holds up the authority of the same tribunal. But this and other\r\nproceedings show abundantly of what efficacy that court has been for the\r\nrelief of the unhappy people of Bengal. A person in delegated authority\r\nrefuses a satisfaction to his superiors, throwing himself on a court of\r\njustice, and supposes that nothing but what judicially appears against\r\nhim is a fit subject of inquiry. But even in this Mr. Hastings fails in\r\nhis application of his principle; for the majority of the Council were\r\nundoubtedly competent to order a prosecution against him in the Supreme\r\nCourt, which they had no ground for without a previous inquiry. But\r\ntheir inquiry had other objects. No private accuser might choose to\r\nappear. The party who was the subject of the peculation might be (as\r\nhere is stated) the accomplice in it. No popular action or popular suit\r\nwas provided by the charter under whose authority the court was\r\ninstituted. In any event, a suit might fail in the court for the\r\npunishment of an actor in an abuse for want of the strictest legal\r\nproof, which might yet furnish matter for the correction of the abuse,\r\nand even reasons strong enough not only to justify, but to require, the\r\nDirectors instantly to address for the removal of a\r\nGovernor-General.--The opposition of Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell proved\r\nas ineffectual in this stage as the former; and a day was named by the\r\nmajority for the attendance of the party.\r\n\r\nThe day following this deliberation, on the assembling of the Council,\r\nthe Governor-General, Mr. Hastings, said, \"he would not sit to be\r\nconfronted by such accusers, nor to _suffer_ a judicial inquiry into his\r\nconduct at the board of which he is the president.\" As on the former\r\noccasions, he declares the board dissolved. As on the former occasions,\r\nthe majority did not admit his claim to this power; they proceeded in\r\nhis absence to examine the accuser and witnesses. Their proceedings are\r\nin Appendix K.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that, during this transaction, Khân Jehan Khân, the\r\nparty with whom the corrupt agreement was made, declined an attendance\r\nunder excuses which the majority thought pretences for delay, though\r\nthey used no compulsory methods towards his appearance. At length,\r\nhowever, he did appear, and then a step was taken by Mr. Hastings of a\r\nvery extraordinary nature, after the steps which he had taken before,\r\nand the declarations with which those steps had been accompanied. Mr.\r\nHastings, who had absolutely refused to be present in the foregoing part\r\nof the proceeding, appeared with Khân Jehan Khân. And now the affair\r\ntook another turn; other obstructions were raised. General Clavering\r\nsaid that the informations hitherto taken had proceeded upon oath. Khân\r\nJehan Khân had previously declared to General Clavering his readiness to\r\nbe so examined; but when called upon by the board, he changed his mind,\r\nand alleged a delicacy, relative to his rank, with regard to the oath.\r\nIn this scruple he was strongly supported by Mr. Hastings. He and Mr.\r\nBarwell went further: they contended that the Council had no right to\r\nadminister an oath. They must have been very clear in that opinion, when\r\nthey resisted the examination on oath of the very person who, if he\r\ncould safely swear to Mr. Hastings's innocence, owed it as a debt to his\r\npatron not to refuse it; and of the payment of this debt it was\r\nextraordinary in the patron not only to enforce, but to support, the\r\nabsolute refusal.\r\n\r\nAlthough the majority did not acquiesce in this doctrine, they appeared\r\nto have doubts of the prudence of enforcing it by violent means; but,\r\nconstruing his refusal into a disposition to screen the peculations of\r\nthe Governor-General, they treated him as guilty of a contempt of their\r\nboard, dismissed him from the service, and recommended another (not the\r\naccuser) to his office.\r\n\r\nThe reasons on both sides appear in the Appendix. Mr. Hastings accuses\r\nthem bitterly of injustice to himself in considering the refusal of this\r\nperson to swear as a charge proved. How far they did so, and under what\r\nqualifications, will appear by reference to the papers in the Appendix.\r\nBut Mr. Hastings \"thanks God that they are not his judges.\" His great\r\nhold, and not without reason, is the Supreme Court; and he \"blesses the\r\nwisdom of Parliament, that constituted a court of judicature at so\r\nseasonable a time, to check the despotism of the new Council.\" It was\r\nthought in England that the court had other objects than the protection\r\nof the Governor-General against the examinations of those sent out with\r\ninstructions to inquire into the peculations of men in power.\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Hastings did at that time, and avowedly did, everything to\r\nprevent any inquiry that was instituted merely for the information of\r\nthe Court of Directors, yet he did not feel himself thoroughly satisfied\r\nwith his own proceedings. It was evident that to them his and Mr.\r\nBarwell's reasonings would not appear very respectful or satisfactory;\r\nhe therefore promises to give them full satisfaction at some future\r\ntime. In his letter of the 14th of September, 1775, he reiterates a\r\nformer declaration, and assures them of his resolution to this purpose\r\nin the strongest terms. \"I now _again_ recur to the declaration which I\r\nhave before made, that it is my fixed determination to carry _literally_\r\ninto execution, and _most fully and liberally explain every circumstance\r\nof my conduct on the points upon which I have been injuriously\r\narraigned_,--and to afford you the clearest conviction of my own\r\nintegrity, and of the propriety of my motives for my declining a present\r\ndefence of it.\"\r\n\r\nThese motives, as far as they can be discovered, were the violence of\r\nhis adversaries, the interested character and views of the accuser, and\r\nthe danger of a prosecution in the Supreme Court, which made it prudent\r\nto reserve his defence. These arguments are applicable to any charge.\r\nNotwithstanding these reasons, it is plain by the above letter that he\r\nthought himself bound at some time or other to give satisfaction to his\r\nmasters: till he should do this, in his own opinion, he remained in an\r\nunpleasant situation. But he bore his misfortune, it seems, patiently,\r\nwith a confidence in their justice for his future relief. He says,\r\n\"Whatever evil may fill the _long interval_ which may precede it.\" That\r\ninterval he has taken care to make long enough; for near eight years are\r\nnow elapsed, and he has not yet taken the smallest step towards giving\r\nto the Court of Directors any explanation whatever, much less that full\r\nand liberal explanation which he had so repeatedly and solemnly\r\npromised.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that, though Mr. Hastings talks in these letters\r\nmuch of his integrity, and of the purity of his motives, and of full\r\nexplanations, he nowhere denies the fact of this corrupt traffic of\r\noffice. Though he had adjourned his defence, with so much pain to\r\nhimself, to so very long a day, he was not so inattentive to the ease of\r\nKhân Jehan Khân as he has shown himself to his own. He had been accused\r\nof corruptly reserving to himself a part of the emoluments of this man's\r\noffice; it was a delicate business to handle, whilst his defence stood\r\nadjourned; yet, in a very short time after a majority came into his\r\nhands, he turned out the person appointed by General Clavering, &c, and\r\nreplaced the very man with whom he stood accused of the corrupt bargain;\r\nwhat was worse, he had been charged with originally turning out\r\nanother, to make room for this man. The whole is put in strong terms by\r\nthe then majority of the Council, where, after charging him with every\r\nspecies of peculation, they add, \"We believe the proofs of his\r\nappropriating four parts in seven of the salary with which the Company\r\nis charged for the Phousdar of Hoogly are such as, whether sufficient or\r\nnot to convict him in a court of justice, will not leave the shadow of a\r\ndoubt concerning his guilt in the mind of any unprejudiced person. The\r\nsalary is seventy-two thousand rupees a year; the Governor takes\r\nthirty-six thousand, and allows Cantoo Baboo four thousand more for the\r\ntrouble he submits to in conducting the negotiation with the Phousdar.\r\nThis also is the common subject of conversation and derision through the\r\nwhole settlement. It is our firm opinion and belief, that the late\r\nPhousdar of Hoogly, a relation of Mahomed Reza Khân, was turned out of\r\nthis office merely because his terms were not so favorable as those\r\nwhich the Honorable Governor-General has obtained from the present\r\nPhousdar. The Honorable Governor-General is pleased to assert, with a\r\nconfidential spirit peculiar to himself, that his measures hitherto\r\nstand unimpeached, except by us. We know not how this assertion is to be\r\nmade good, unless _the most daring and flagrant prostitution in every\r\nbranch_ be deemed an honor to his administration.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole style and tenor of these accusations, as well as the nature of\r\nthem, rendered Mr. Hastings's first postponing, and afterwards totally\r\ndeclining, all denial, or even defence or explanation, very\r\nextraordinary. No Governor ought to hear in silence such charges; and\r\nno Court of Directors ought to have slept upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Directors were not wholly inattentive to this business.\r\nThey condemned his act as it deserved, and they went into the business\r\nof his legal right to dissolve the Council. Their opinions seemed\r\nagainst it, and they gave precise orders against the use of any such\r\npower in future. On consulting Mr. Sayer, the Company's counsel, he was\r\nof a different opinion with regard to the legal right; but he thought,\r\nvery properly, that the use of a right, and the manner and purposes for\r\nwhich it was used, ought not to have been separated. What he thought on\r\nthis occasion appears in his opinion transmitted by the Court of\r\nDirectors to Mr. Hastings and the Council-General. \"But it was as great\r\na _crime_ to dissolve the Council upon _base and sinister motives_ as it\r\nwould be to assume the power of dissolving, if he had it not. I believe\r\nhe is _the first governor that ever_ dissolved a council inquiring into\r\nhis behavior, when he was innocent. Before he could summon three\r\ncouncils and dissolve them, he had time fully to consider what would be\r\nthe result of such conduct, _to convince everybody, beyond a doubt, of\r\nhis conscious guilt_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a matter but of small consolation to Mr. Hastings, during the\r\npainful interval he describes, to find that the Company's learned\r\ncounsel admitted that he had legal powers of which he made an use that\r\nraised an universal presumption of his guilt.\r\n\r\nOther counsel did not think so favorably of the powers themselves. But\r\nthis matter was of less consequence, because a great difference of\r\nopinion may arise concerning the extent of official powers, even among\r\nmen professionally educated, (as in this case such a difference did\r\narise,) and well-intentioned men may take either part. But the use that\r\nwas made of it, in systematical contradiction to the Company's orders,\r\nhas been stated in the Ninth Report, as well as in many of the others\r\nmade by two of your committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Appendix B.

No. 1.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Copy of a Letter from the Governor-General to the Court of Directors._\r\n\r\nTo the Honorable the Court of Directors of the Honorable United East\r\nIndia Company.\r\n\r\nFORT WILLIAM, 29th November, 1780.\r\n\r\nHONORABLE SIRS,--\r\n\r\nYou will be informed by our Consultations of the 26th of June of a very\r\nunusual tender which was made by me to the board on that day, for the\r\npurpose of indemnifying the Company for the extraordinary expense which\r\nmight be incurred by supplying the detachment under the command of Major\r\nCamac in the invasion of the Mahratta dominions, which lay beyond the\r\ndistrict of Gohud, and drawing the attention of Mahdajee Sindia, to whom\r\nthat country immediately appertained, from General Goddard, while his\r\nwas employed in the reduction of Bassein, and in securing the conquests\r\nmade by your arms in Guzerat. I was desirous to remove the only\r\nobjection which has been or could be ostensibly made to the measure,\r\nwhich I had very much at heart, as may be easily conceived from the\r\nmeans which I took to effect it. For the reasons at large which induced\r\nme to propose that diversion, it will be sufficient to refer to my\r\nminute recommending it, and to the letters received from General Goddard\r\nnear the same period of time. The subject is now become obsolete, and\r\nall the fair hopes which I had built upon the prosecution of the\r\nMahratta war, of its termination in a speedy, honorable, and\r\nadvantageous peace, have been blasted by the dreadful calamities which\r\nhave befallen your arms in the dependencies of your Presidency of Fort\r\nSt. George, and changed the object of our pursuit from the\r\naggrandizement of your power to its preservation. My present reason for\r\nreverting to my own conduct on the occasion which I have mentioned is to\r\nobviate the false conclusions or purposed misrepresentations which may\r\nbe made of it, either as an artifice of ostentation or as the effect of\r\ncorrupt influence, by assuring you that the money, _by whatever means it\r\ncame into your possession_, was not my own,--that I had myself no right\r\nto it, nor would or could have received it, but for the occasion which\r\nprompted me to avail myself of the accidental means which were at that\r\ninstant afforded me of accepting and converting it to the property and\r\nuse of the Company; and with this brief apology I shall dismiss the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nSomething of affinity to this anecdote may appear in the first aspect of\r\n_another_ transaction, which I shall proceed to relate, and of which it\r\nis more immediately my duty to inform you.\r\n\r\nYou will have been advised, by repeated addresses of this government, of\r\nthe arrival of an army at Cuttack, under the command of Chimnajee\r\nBoosla, the second son of Moodajee Boosla, the Rajah of Berar. The\r\norigin and destination of this force have been largely explained and\r\ndetailed in the correspondence of the government of Berar, and in\r\nvarious parts of our Consultations. The minute relation of these would\r\nexceed the bounds of a letter; I shall therefore confine myself to the\r\nprincipal fact.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the last year, a plan of confederacy was formed by\r\nthe Nabob Nizam Ali Khân, by which it was proposed, that, while the army\r\nof the Mahrattas, under the command of Mahdajee Sindia and Tuckoojee\r\nHoolkar, was employed to check the operations of General Goddard in the\r\nWest of India, Hyder Ali Khân should invade the Carnatic, Moodajee\r\nBoosla the provinces of Bengal, and he himself the Circars of Rajamundry\r\nand Chicacole.\r\n\r\nThe government of Berar was required to accept the part assigned it in\r\nthis combination, and to march a large body of troops immediately into\r\nBengal. To enforce the request on the part of the ruling member of the\r\nMahratta state, menaces of instant hostility by the combined forces were\r\nadded by Mahdajee Sindia, Tuckoojee Hoolkar, and Nizam Ali Khân, in\r\nletters written by them to Moodajee Boosla on the occasion. He was not\r\nin a state to sustain the brunt of so formidable a league, and\r\nostensibly yielded. Such at least was the turn which he gave to his\r\nacquiescence, in his letters to me; and his subsequent conduct has\r\njustified his professions. I was early and progressively acquainted by\r\nhim with the requisition, and with the measures which were intended to\r\nbe taken, and which were taken, by him upon it. The army professedly\r\ndestined for Bengal marched on the Dusserra of the last year,\r\ncorresponding with the 7th of October. Instead of taking the direct\r\ncourse to Bahar, which had been prescribed, it proceeded by varied\r\ndeviations and studied delays to Cuttack, where it arrived late in May\r\nlast, having performed a practicable journey of three mouths in seven,\r\nand concluded it at the instant commencement of the rains, which of\r\ncourse would preclude its operations, and afford the government of Berar\r\na further interval of five months to provide for the part which it would\r\nthen be compelled to choose.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time letters were continually written by the Rajah and his\r\nminister to this government, explanatory of their situation and motives,\r\nproposing their mediation and guaranty for a peace and alliance with the\r\nPeshwa, and professing, without solicitation on our part, the most\r\nfriendly disposition towards us, and the most determined resolution to\r\nmaintain it. Conformably to these assurances, and the acceptance of a\r\nproposal made by Moodajee Boosla to depute his minister to Bengal for\r\nthe purpose of negotiating and concluding the proposed treaty of peace,\r\napplication had been made to the Peshwa for credentials to the same\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the fatal news arrived of the defeat of your army at\r\nConjeveram. It now became necessary that every other object should give\r\nplace or be made subservient to the preservation of the Carnatic; nor\r\nwould the measures requisite for that end admit an instant of delay.\r\nPeace with the Mahrattas was the first object; to conciliate their\r\nalliance, and that of every other power in natural enmity with Hyder\r\nAli, the next. Instant measures were taken (as our general advices will\r\ninform you) to secure both these points, and to employ the government\r\nof Berar as the channel and instrument of accomplishing them. Its army\r\nstill lay on our borders, and in distress for a long arrear of pay, not\r\nless occasioned by the want of pecuniary funds than a stoppage of\r\ncommunication. An application had been made to us for a supply of money;\r\nand the sum specified for the complete relief of the army was sixteen\r\nlacs. We had neither money to spare, nor, in the apparent state of that\r\ngovernment in its relation to ours, would it have been either prudent or\r\nconsistent with our public credit to have afforded it. It was\r\nnevertheless my decided opinion that some aid should be given,--not less\r\nas a necessary relief than as an indication of confidence, and a return\r\nfor the many instances of substantial kindness which we had within the\r\ncourse of the last two years experienced from the government of Berar. I\r\nhad an assurance that such a proposal would receive the acquiescence of\r\nthe board; but I knew that it would not pass without opposition, and it\r\nwould have become public, which might have defeated its purpose.\r\nConvinced of the necessity of the expedient, and assured of the\r\nsincerity of the government of Berar, from evidences of stronger proof\r\nto me than I could make them appear to the other members of the board, I\r\nresolved to adopt it, and take the entire responsibility of it upon\r\nmyself. In this mode a less considerable sum would suffice. I\r\naccordingly caused three lacs of rupees to be delivered to the minister\r\nof the Rajah of Berar, resident in Calcutta: he has transmitted it to\r\nCuttack. Two thirds of this sum I have raised by my own credit, and\r\nshall charge it in my official accounts; the other third I have supplied\r\nfrom the cash in my hands belonging to the Honorable Company. I have\r\ngiven due notice to Moodajee Boosla of this transaction, and explained\r\nit to have been a private act of my own, unknown to the other members of\r\nthe Council. I have given him expectations of the remainder of the\r\namount required for the arrears of his army, proportioned to the extent\r\nto which he may put it in my power to propose it as a public gratuity by\r\nhis effectual orders for the recall of these troops, or for their\r\njunction with ours.\r\n\r\nI hope I shall receive your approbation of what I have done for your\r\nservice, and your indulgence for the length of this narrative, which I\r\ncould not comprise within a narrower compass.\r\n\r\n  I have the honor to be, Honorable Sirs,\r\n    Your most faithful, obedient,\r\n      and humble servant,\r\n\r\n  WARREN HASTINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

No. 3.\r\n\r\nTo the Honorable the Secret Committee of the Honorable Court of\r\nDirectors.\r\n\r\nFORT WILLIAM, 22d May, 1782.\r\n\r\nHONORABLE SIRS,--\r\n\r\nIn a letter which I have had the honor to address you in duplicate, and\r\nof which a triplicate accompanies this, dated 20th January, 1782, I\r\ninformed you that I had received the offer of a sum of money from the\r\nNabob Vizier and his ministers to the nominal amount of ten lacs of\r\nLucknow siccas, and that bills on the house of Gopaul Doss had been\r\nactually given me for the amount, which I had accepted for the use of\r\nthe Honorable Company; and I promised to account with you for the same\r\nas soon as it should be in my power, after the whole sum had come into\r\nmy possession. This promise I now perform; and deeming it consistent\r\nwith the spirit of it, I have added such _other_ sums as have been\r\noccasionally converted to the Company's property through my means, and\r\nin consequence of the like original destination. Of the second of these\r\nyou have been already advised in a letter which I had the honor to\r\naddress the Honorable Court of Directors, dated 29th November, 1780.\r\nBoth this and the third article were paid immediately to the Treasury,\r\nby my order to the sub-treasurer to receive them on the Company's\r\naccount, but never passed through my hands. The three sums for which\r\nbonds were granted were in like manner paid to the Company's Treasury\r\nwithout passing through my hands; but their appropriation was not\r\nspecified. The sum of 58,000 current rupees was received while I was on\r\nmy journey to Benares, and applied as expressed in the account.\r\n\r\nAs to the manner in which these sums have been expended, the reference\r\nwhich I have made of it, in the accompanying account, to the several\r\naccounts in which they are credited, renders any other specification of\r\nit unnecessary; besides that those accounts either have or will have\r\nreceived a much stronger authentication than any that I could give to\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nWhy these sums were taken by me,--why they were, except the second,\r\nquietly transferred to the Company's use,--why bonds were taken for the\r\nfirst, and not for the rest,--might, were this matter to be exposed to\r\nthe view of the public, furnish a variety of conjectures, to which it\r\nwould be of little use to reply. Were your Honorable Court to question\r\nme upon these points, I would answer, that the sums were taken for the\r\nCompany's benefit at times in which the Company very much needed\r\nthem,--that I either chose to conceal the first receipts from public\r\ncuriosity by receiving bonds for the amount, or possibly acted without\r\nany studied design which my memory could at this distance of time\r\nverify, and that I did not think it worth my care to observe the same\r\nmeans with the rest. I trust, Honorable Sirs, to your breasts for a\r\ncandid interpretation of my actions, and assume the freedom to add, that\r\nI think myself, on such a subject, and on such an occasion, entitled to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n  I have the honor to be, Honorable Sirs,\r\n    Your most faithful, most obedient,\r\n      and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n  WARREN HASTINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

The delay is of no\r\npublic consequence; but it has produced a situation which with respect\r\nto myself I regard as unfortunate, because it exposes me to the meanest\r\nimputation from the occasion which the late Parliamentary Inquiries have\r\nsince furnished, but which were unknown when my letter was written, and\r\nwritten in the necessary consequence of a promise made to that effect in\r\na former letter to your Honorable Committee, dated 20th January last.\r\nHowever, to preclude the possibility of such reflections from affecting\r\nme, I have desired Mr. Larkins, who was privy to the whole transaction,\r\nto affix to the letter his affidavit of the date in which it was\r\nwritten. I own I feel most sensibly the mortification of being reduced\r\nto the necessity of using such precautions to guard my reputation from\r\ndishonor. If I had at any time possessed that degree of confidence from\r\nmy immediate employers which they never withheld from the meanest of my\r\npredecessors, I should have disdained to use these attentions. How I\r\nhave drawn on me a different treatment I know not; it is sufficient that\r\nI have not merited it: and in the course of a service of thirty-two\r\nyears, and ten of these employed in maintaining the powers and\r\ndischarging the duties of the first office of the British government in\r\nIndia, that Honorable Court ought to know whether I possess the\r\nintegrity and honor which are the first requisites of such a station. If\r\nI wanted these, they have afforded me but too powerful incentives to\r\nsuppress the information which I now convey to them through you, and to\r\nappropriate to my own use the sums which I have already passed to their\r\ncredit, by the unworthy, and, pardon me if I add, dangerous, reflections\r\nwhich they have passed upon me for the first communication of this kind:\r\nand your own experience will suggest to you, that there are persons who\r\nwould profit by such a warning.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole of these transactions, which to you, who are accustomed\r\nto view business in an official and regular light, may appear\r\nunprecedented, if not improper, I have but a few short remarks to\r\nsuggest to your consideration.\r\n\r\nIf I appear in any unfavorable light by these transactions, I resign the\r\ncommon and legal security of those who commit crimes or errors. I am\r\nready to answer every particular question that may be put against\r\nmyself, upon honor or upon oath.\r\n\r\nThe sources from which these reliefs to the public service have come\r\nwould never have yielded them to the Company publicly; and the\r\nexigencies of your service (exigencies created by the exposition of your\r\naffairs, and faction in your councils) required those supplies.\r\n\r\nI could have concealed them, had I had a wrong motive, from yours and\r\nthe public eye forever; and I know that the difficulties to which a\r\nspirit of injustice may subject me for my candor and avowal are greater\r\nthan any possible inconvenience that could have attended the\r\nconcealment, except the dissatisfaction of my own mind. These\r\ndifficulties are but a few of those which I have suffered in your\r\nservice. The applause of my own breast is my surest reward, and was the\r\nsupport of my mind in meeting them: your applause, and that of my\r\ncountry, are my next wish in life.\r\n\r\n  I have the honor to be, Honorable Sirs,\r\n    Your most faithful, most obedient,\r\n      and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n  WARREN HASTINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. No. 7.\r\n\r\n_Extract of the Company's General Letter to Bengal, dated the 25th\r\nJanuary, 1782._\r\n\r\nPar. 127. We have received a letter from our Governor-General,\r\ndated the 29th of November, 1780, relative to an unusual tender and\r\nadvance of money made by him to the Council, as entered on your\r\nConsultation of the 26th of June, for the purpose of indemnifying the\r\nCompany from the extraordinary charge which might be incurred by\r\nsupplying the detachment under the command of Major Camac in the\r\ninvasion of the Mahratta dominions, which lay beyond the district of\r\nGohud, and thereby drawing the attention of Mahdajee Sindia (to whom the\r\ncountry appertained) from General Goddard, while the General was\r\nemployed in the reduction of Bassein, and in securing the conquests\r\nmade in the Guzerat country; and also respecting the sum of three lacs\r\nof rupees advanced by the Governor-General for the use of the army under\r\nthe command of Chimnajee Boosla without the authority or knowledge of\r\nthe Council; with the reasons for taking these extraordinary steps under\r\nthe circumstances stated in his letter.\r\n\r\n128. In regard to the first of these transactions, we readily conceive,\r\nthat, in the then state of the Council, the Governor-General might be\r\ninduced to temporary secrecy respecting the members of the board, not\r\nonly because he might be apprehensive of opposition to the proposed\r\napplication of the money, but, perhaps, because doubts might have arisen\r\nconcerning the propriety of appropriating it to the Company's use on any\r\naccount; but it does _not appear to us_ that there could be any real\r\nnecessity for delaying to communicate to us immediate information of the\r\nchannel by which the money came into his possession, with a complete\r\nillustration of the cause or causes of so extraordinary an event.\r\n\r\n129. Circumstanced as affairs were at the moment, it appears that the\r\nGovernor-General had the measure much at heart, and judged it absolutely\r\nnecessary. The means proposed of defraying the extra expense were very\r\nextraordinary; and the money, as we conceive, must have come into his\r\nhands by an unusual channel: and when more complete information comes\r\nbefore us, we shall give our sentiments fully upon the whole\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\n130. In regard to the application of the Company's money to the army of\r\nChimnajee Boosla by the sole authority of the Governor-General, he knew\r\nthat it was entirely at his own risk, and he has taken the\r\nresponsibility upon himself; nothing but the most urgent necessity\r\ncould warrant the measure; nor can anything short of full proof of such\r\nnecessity, and of the propriety and utility of the extraordinary step\r\ntaken on the occasion, entitle the Governor-General to the approbation\r\nof the Court of Directors; and therefore, as in the former instance\r\nrelative to the sum advanced and paid into our Treasury, we must also\r\nfor the present _suspend_ our judgment respecting the money sent to the\r\nBerar army, without approving it in the least degree, or proceeding to\r\ncensure our Governor-General for this transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

That the said Court laid it down as _an invariable maxim,\r\nwhich ought ever to be maintained, that they were to avoid taking part\r\nin the political schemes of any of the country princes_,--and did, in\r\nparticular, order and direct that they should not engage with a certain\r\nprince called Sujah ul Dowlah, Nabob of Oude, and Vizier of the Empire,\r\nin any operations beyond certain limits in the said orders specially\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThat Warren Hastings, Esquire, then Governor of Fort William in Bengal,\r\ndid, with other members of the Council, declare his clear understanding\r\nof the true intent and meaning of the said positive and repeated orders\r\nand injunctions,--did express to the Court of Directors his approbation\r\nof the policy thereof,--did declare that he adopted the same _with\r\nsincerity and satisfaction_, and that he was _too well aware of the\r\nruinous tendency of all schemes of conquest ever to adopt them, or ever\r\nto depart from the absolute line of self-defence, unless impelled to it\r\nby the most obvious necessity_,--did signify to the Nabob of Oude the\r\nsaid orders, and his obligation to yield punctual obedience\r\nthereto,--and did solemnly engage and promise to the Court of Directors,\r\nwith the _unanimous concurrence_ of the whole Council, \"that no object\r\nor consideration should either tempt or compel him to pass the political\r\nline which they [the Directors] had laid down for his operations with\r\nthe Vizier,\" assuring the Court of Directors that he \"scarce saw a\r\npossible advantage which could compensate the hazard and expense to be\r\nincurred by a contrary conduct,\"--that he did frequently repeat the same\r\ndeclarations, or declarations to the same effect, particularly in a\r\nletter to the Nabob himself, of the 22d of November, 1773, in the\r\nfollowing words: \"The commands of my superiors are, as I have repeatedly\r\ninformed you, peremptory, that I shall not suffer their arms to be\r\ncarried beyond the line of their own boundaries, and those of your\r\nExcellency, their ally.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, in direct contradiction to the said\r\norders, and to his own sense of their propriety and coercive authority,\r\nand in breach of his express promises and engagements, did, in\r\nSeptember, 1773, enter into a private engagement with the said Nabob of\r\nOude, who was the special object of the prohibition, to furnish him, for\r\na stipulated sum of money to be paid to the East India Company, with a\r\nbody of troops for the declared purpose of \"thoroughly extirpating the\r\nnation of the Rohillas\": a nation from whom the Company had never\r\nreceived, or pretended to receive or apprehend, any injury whatsoever;\r\nwhose country, in the month of February, 1773, by an unanimous\r\nresolution of the said Warren Hastings and his Council, was included in\r\nthe line of defence against the Mahrattas; and from whom the Nabob never\r\ncomplained of an aggression or act of hostility, nor pretended a\r\ndistinct cause of quarrel, other than the non-payment of a sum of money\r\nin dispute between him and that people.\r\n\r\nThat, supposing the sum of money in question to have been strictly due\r\nto the said Nabob by virtue of any engagement between him and the\r\nRohilla chiefs, the East India Company, or their representatives, were\r\nnot parties to that engagement, or guaranties thereof, nor bound by any\r\nobligation whatever to enforce the execution of it.\r\n\r\nThat, previous to the said Warren Hastings's entering into the agreement\r\nor bargain aforesaid to extirpate the said nation, he did not make, or\r\ncause to be made, a due inquiry into the validity of the sole pretext\r\nused by the said Nabob; nor did he give notice of the said claims of\r\ndebt to the nation of the Rohillas, in order to receive an explanation\r\non their part of the matter in litigation; nor did he offer any\r\nmediation, nor propose, nor afford an opportunity of proposing, an\r\nagreement or submission by which the calamities of war might be avoided,\r\nas, by the high state in which the East India Company stood as a\r\nsovereign power in the East, and the honor and character it ought to\r\nmaintain, as well as by the principles of equity and humanity, and by\r\nthe true and obvious policy of uniting the power of the Mahometan\r\nprinces against the Mahrattas, he was bound to do. That, instead of\r\nsuch previous inquiry, or tender of good offices, the said Warren\r\nHastings did stimulate the ambition and ferocity of the Nabob of Oude to\r\nthe full completion of the inhuman end of the said unjustifiable\r\nenterprise, by informing him \"that it would be absolutely necessary to\r\npersevere in it until it should be accomplished\"; pretending that a fear\r\nof the Company's displeasure was his motive for annexing the\r\naccomplishment of the enterprise as a condition of his assistance, and\r\nasserting \"that he could not hazard or answer for the displeasure of the\r\nCompany, his masters, if they should find themselves involved in a\r\n_fruitless_ war, or in an expense for prosecuting it,\"--a pretence\r\ntending to the high dishonor of the East India Company, as if the gain\r\nto be acquired was to reconcile that body to the breach of their own\r\norders prohibiting all such enterprises;--and in order further to\r\ninvolve the said Nabob beyond the power of retreating, he did, in the\r\ncourse of the proceeding, purposely put the said Nabob under\r\ndifficulties in case he should decline that war, and did oblige him to\r\naccept even the permission to relinquish the execution of this unjust\r\nproject as a favor, and _to make concessions for it_; thereby acting as\r\nif the Company were principals in the hostility; and employing for this\r\npurpose much double dealing and divers unworthy artifices to entangle\r\nand perplex the said Nabob, but by means of which he found himself (as\r\nhe has entered it on record) _hampered and embarrassed in a particular\r\nmanner_.\r\n\r\nThat the said compact for offensive alliance in favor of a great prince\r\nagainst a considerable nation was not carried on by projects and\r\ncounter-projects in writing; nor were the articles and conditions\r\nthereof formed into any regular written instrument, signed and sealed\r\nby the parties; but the whole (both the negotiation and the compact of\r\noffensive alliance against the Rohillas) was a mere verbal engagement,\r\nthe purport and conventions whereof nowhere appeared, except in\r\nsubsequent correspondence, in which certain of the articles, as they\r\nwere stated by the several parties, did materially differ: a proceeding\r\nnew and unprecedented, and directly leading to mutual misconstruction,\r\nevasion, and ill faith, and tending to encourage and protect every\r\nspecies of corrupt, clandestine practice. That, at the time when this\r\nprivate verbal agreement was made by the said Warren Hastings with the\r\nNabob of Oude, a public ostensible treaty was concluded by him with the\r\nsaid Nabob, in which there is no mention whatever of such agreement, or\r\nreference whatever to it: in defence of which omission, it is asserted\r\nby the said Warren Hastings, that _the multiplication of treaties\r\nweakens their efficacy, and therefore they should be reserved only for\r\nvery important and permanent obligations_; notwithstanding he had\r\npreviously declared to the said Nabob, \"that the points which he had\r\nproposed required much consideration, and the previous ratification of a\r\nformal agreement, before he could consent to them.\" That the whole of\r\nthe said verbal agreement with the Nabob of Oude in his own person,\r\nwithout any assistance on his part, was carried on and concluded by the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings alone, without any person who might witness the\r\nsame, without the intervention even of an interpreter, though he\r\nconfesses that he spoke the Hindostan language _imperfectly_, and\r\nalthough he had with him at that time and place several persons high in\r\nthe Company's service and confidence, namely, the commander-in-chief of\r\ntheir forces, two members of their Council, and the Secretary to the\r\nCouncil, who were not otherwise acquainted with the proceedings between\r\nhim and the said Nabob than by such communications as he thought fit to\r\nmake to them.\r\n\r\nThat the object avowed by the said Warren Hastings, and the motives\r\nurged by him for employing the British arms in the utter extirpation of\r\nthe Rohilla nation, are stated by himself in the following terms:--\"The\r\nacquisition of forty lacs of rupees to the Company, and of so much\r\nspecie added to the exhausted currency of our provinces;--that it would\r\ngive wealth to the Nabob of Oude, of which we should participate;--that\r\nthe said Warren Hastings _should_ always be ready to profess that he did\r\nreckon the probable acquisition of wealth among his reasons for taking\r\nup arms against his _neighbors_;--that it would ease the Company of a\r\nconsiderable part of their military expense, and preserve their troops\r\nfrom inaction and relaxation of discipline;--that the weak state of the\r\nRohillas promised an easy conquest of them;--and, finally, that such was\r\nhis idea of the Company's distress at home, added to his knowledge of\r\ntheir wants abroad, that he should have been glad of _any_ occasion to\r\nemploy their forces which saved so much of their pay and expenses.\"\r\n\r\nThat, in the private verbal agreement aforesaid for offensive war, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings did transgress the bounds of the authority given\r\nhim by his instructions from the Council of Fort William, which had\r\nlimited his powers to such compacts \"as were consistent with the spirit\r\nof the Company's orders\"; which Council he afterwards persuaded, and\r\nwith difficulty drew into an acquiescence in what he had done.\r\n\r\nThat the agreement to the effect aforesaid was settled in the said\r\nsecret conferences before the 10th of September, 1773; but the said\r\nWarren Hastings, concealing from the Court of Directors a matter of\r\nwhich it was his duty to afford them the earliest and fullest\r\ninformation, did, on the said 10th of September, 1773, write to the\r\nDirectors, and dispatched his letter over land, giving them an account\r\nof the public treaty, but taking not the least notice of his agreement\r\nfor a mercenary war against the nation of the Rohillas.\r\n\r\nThat, in order to conceal the true purport of the said clandestine\r\nagreement the more effectually, and until he should find means of\r\ngaining over the rest of the Council to a concurrence in his\r\ndisobedience of orders, he entered a minute in the Council books, giving\r\na false account of the transaction; in which minute he represented that\r\nthe Nabob had indeed _proposed_ the design aforesaid, and that he, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, _was pleased that he urged the scheme of this\r\nexpedition no further_, when in reality and truth he had absolutely\r\nconsented to the said enterprise, and had engaged to assist him in it,\r\nwhich he afterwards admitted, and confessed that he did act in\r\nconsequence of the same.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings and his Council were sensible of the true\r\nnature of the enterprise in which they had engaged the Company's arms,\r\nand of the heavy responsibility to which it would subject himself and\r\nthe Council,--\"the personal hazard they, the Council, run, in\r\nundertaking so _uncommon_ a measure without _positive_ instructions, at\r\ntheir own risk, with the eyes of the whole nation on the affairs of the\r\nCompany, and the passions and prejudices of almost every man in England\r\ninflamed against the conduct of the Company and the character of its\r\nservants\"; yet they engaged in the very practice which had brought such\r\nodium on the Company, and on the character of its servants, though they\r\nfurther say that they had continually before _their eyes the dread of\r\nforfeiting the favor of their employers_, and becoming the \"objects of\r\n_popular_ invectives.\" The said Warren Hastings himself says, at the\r\nvery time when he proposed the measure, \"I must confess I entertain some\r\ndoubts as to its expediency at this time, from the circumstances of the\r\n_Company_ at home, exposed to _popular_ clamor, and all its measures\r\nliable to be canvassed in _Parliament_, their charter drawing to a\r\nclose, and his Majesty's ministers unquestionably ready to take\r\nadvantage of every unfavorable circumstance in the negotiations of its\r\nrenewal.\" All these considerations did not prevent the said Warren\r\nHastings from making and carrying into execution the said mercenary\r\nagreement for a sum of money, the payment of which the Nabob endeavored\r\nto evade on a construction of the verbal treaty, and was so far from\r\nbeing insisted on, as it ought to have been, by the said Warren\r\nHastings, that, when, after the completion of the service, the\r\ncommander-in-chief was directed to make a demand of the money, the agent\r\nof the said Warren Hastings at the same time assured the Nabob \"that the\r\ndemand was nothing more than matter of form, common, and even necessary,\r\nin all public transactions, and that, although the board considered the\r\nclaim of the government literally due, it was not the intention of\r\nadministration to prescribe to his Excellency _the mode, or even\r\nlimits, of payment_.\" Nor was any part of the money recovered, until the\r\nestablishment of the Governor-General and Council by act of Parliament,\r\nand their determination to withdraw the brigade from the Nabob's\r\nservice,--the Resident at his court, appointed by the said Warren\r\nHastings, having written, _that he had experienced much duplicity and\r\ndeceit in most of his transactions with his Excellency_; and the said\r\nNabob and his successors falling back in other payments in the same or\r\ngreater proportion as he advanced in the payment of this debt, the\r\nconsideration of lucre to the Company, the declared motive to this\r\nshameful transaction, totally failed, and no money in effect and\r\nsubstance (as far as by any account to be depended on appears) has been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThat the said Nabob of Oude did, in consequence of the said agreement,\r\nand with the assistance of British troops, which were ordered to march\r\nand subjected to his disposal by the said Warren Hastings and the\r\nCouncil, unjustly enter into and invade the country of the Rohillas, and\r\ndid there make war in a barbarous and inhuman manner, \"by an abuse of\r\nvictory,\" \"by the unnecessary destruction of the country,\" \"by a wanton\r\ndisplay of violence and oppression, of inhumanity and cruelty,\" and \"by\r\nthe sudden expulsion and casting down of an whole race of people, to\r\nwhom the slightest benevolence was denied.\" When prayer was made not to\r\ndishonor the Begum (a princess of great rank, whose husband had been\r\nkilled in battle) and other women, by _dragging them about the country,\r\nto be loaded with the scoffs of the Nabob's rabble, and otherwise still\r\nworse used_, the Nabob refused to listen to the entreaties of a British\r\ncommander-in-chief in their favor; and the said women of high rank were\r\nexposed not only to the vilest personal indignities, but even to\r\nabsolute want: and these transactions being by Colonel Champion\r\ncommunicated to the said Warren Hastings, instead of commendations for\r\nhis intelligence, and orders to redress the said evils, and to prevent\r\nthe like in future, by means which were suggested, and which appear to\r\nhave been proper and feasible, he received a reprimand from the said\r\nWarren Hastings, who declared that we had no authority to control the\r\nconduct of the Vizier in the treatment of his subjects; and that Colonel\r\nChampion desisted from making further representations on this subject to\r\nthe said Warren Hastings, being apprehensive of having already run some\r\nrisk of displeasing by perhaps a too free communication of sentiments.\r\nThat, in consequence of the said proceedings, not only the eminent\r\nfamilies of the chiefs of the Rohilla nation were either cut off or\r\nbanished, and their wives and offspring reduced to utter ruin, but the\r\ncountry itself, heretofore distinguished above all others for the extent\r\nof its cultivation as a _garden_, not having _one spot_ in it of\r\n_uncultivated_ ground, and from being _in the most flourishing state\r\nthat a country could be_, was by the inhuman mode of carrying on the\r\nwar, and the ill government during the consequent usurpation, reduced to\r\na state of great decay and depopulation, in which it still remains.\r\n\r\nThat the East India Company, having had reason to conceive, that, for\r\nthe purpose of concealing corrupt transactions, their servants in India\r\nhad made unfair, mutilated, and garbled communications of\r\ncorrespondence, and sometimes had wholly withheld the same, made an\r\norder in their letter of the 23d of March, 1770, in the following\r\ntenor:--\"The Governor singly shall correspond with the country powers;\r\nbut _all_ letters, before they shall be by him sent, must be\r\ncommunicated to the other members of the Select Committee, and receive\r\ntheir approbation; and also _all_ letters _whatsoever_ which may be\r\nreceived by the Governor, in answer to or in course of correspondence,\r\nshall likewise be laid before the said Select Committee for their\r\ninformation and consideration\"; and that in their instructions to their\r\nGovernor-General and Council, dated 30th March, 1774, they did repeat\r\ntheir orders to the same purpose and effect.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings did not obey, as in duty he was bound to\r\ndo, the said standing orders; nor did communicate all his correspondence\r\nwith Mr. Middleton, the Company's agent at the court of the Subah of\r\nOude, or with Colonel Champion, the commander-in-chief of the Company's\r\nforces in the Rohilla war, to the Select Committee: and when afterwards,\r\nthat is to say, on the 25th of October, 1774, he was required by the\r\nmajority of the Council appointed by the act of Parliament of 1773,\r\nwhose opinion was by the said act directed to be taken as the act of the\r\nwhole Council, to produce _all_ his correspondence with Mr. Middleton\r\nand Colonel Champion for the direction of their future proceedings\r\nrelative to the obscure, intricate, and critical transaction aforesaid,\r\nhe did positively and pertinaciously refuse to deliver any other than\r\nsuch parts of the said correspondence as he thought convenient, covering\r\nhis said illegal refusal under general vague pretences of secrecy and\r\ndanger from the communication, although the said order and instruction\r\nof the Court of Directors above mentioned was urged to him, and although\r\nit was represented to him by the said Council, that they, as well as\r\nhe, were bound by an oath of secrecy: which refusal to obey the orders\r\nof the Court of Directors (orders specially, and on weighty grounds of\r\nexperience, pointed to cases of this very nature) gave rise to much\r\njealousy, and excited great suspicions relative to the motives and\r\ngrounds on which the Rohilla war had been undertaken.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, in the grounds alleged in his\r\njustification of his refusal to communicate to his colleagues in the\r\nSuperior Council his correspondence with Mr. Middleton, the Company's\r\nResident at Oude, was guilty of a new offence, arrogating to himself\r\nunprecedented and dangerous powers, on principles utterly subversive of\r\nall order and discipline in service, and introductory to corrupt\r\nconfederacies and disobedience among the Company's servants; the said\r\nWarren Hastings insisting that Mr. Middleton, the Company's covenanted\r\nservant, the public Resident for transacting the Company's affairs at\r\nthe court of the Subah of Oude, and as such receiving from the Company a\r\nsalary for his service, was no other than the _official agent_ of him,\r\nthe said Warren Hastings, and that, being such, he was not obliged to\r\ncommunicate his correspondence.\r\n\r\nThat the Court of Directors, and afterwards a General Court of the\r\nProprietors of the East India Company, (although the latter showed\r\nfavorable dispositions towards the said Warren Hastings, and expressed,\r\nbut without assigning any ground or reason, the highest opinion of his\r\nservices and integrity,) did unanimously condemn, along with his conduct\r\nrelative to the Rohilla treaty and war, his refusal to communicate his\r\nwhole correspondence with Mr. Middleton to the Superior Council: yet the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, in defiance of the opinion of the Directors, and\r\nthe unanimous opinion of the General Court of the said East India\r\nCompany, as well as the precedent positive orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors, and the injunctions of an act of Parliament, has, from that\r\ntime to the present, never made any communication of the whole of his\r\ncorrespondence to the Governor-General and Council, or to the Court of\r\nDirectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--SHAH ALLUM.\r\n\r\nThat, in a solemn treaty of peace, concluded the 16th of August, 1765,\r\nbetween the East India Company and the late Nabob of Oude, Sujah ul\r\nDowlah, and highly approved of, confirmed, and ratified by the said\r\nCompany, it is agreed, \"that the King Shah Allum shall remain in full\r\npossession of Corah, and such part of the province of Allahabad as he\r\nnow possesses, which are ceded to his Majesty as a royal demesne for the\r\nsupport of his dignity and expenses.\" That, in a separate agreement,\r\nconcluded at the same time, between the King Shah Allum and the then\r\nSubahdar of Bengal, under the immediate security and guaranty of the\r\nEnglish Company, the faith of the Company was pledged to the said King\r\nfor the annual payment of twenty-six lac of rupees for his support out\r\nof the revenues of Bengal; and that the said Company did then receive\r\nfrom the said King a grant of the duanné of the provinces of Bengal,\r\nBahar, and Orissa, on the express condition of their being security for\r\nthe annual payment above mentioned. That the East India Company have\r\nheld, and continue to hold, the duanné so granted, and for some years\r\nhave complied with the conditions on which they accepted of the grant\r\nthereof, and have at all times acknowledged that they held the duanné\r\n_in virtue of the Mogul's grants_. That the said Court of Directors, in\r\ntheir letter of the 30th June, 1769, to Bengal, declared, \"that they\r\nesteemed themselves bound by treaty to protect the King's person, and to\r\nsecure him the possession of the Corah and Allahabad districts\"; and\r\nsupposing an agreement should be made respecting these provinces between\r\nthe King and Sujah ul Dowlah, the Directors then said, \"that they should\r\nbe subject to no further claim or requisition from the King, excepting\r\nfor the stipulated tribute for Bengal, which they [the Governor and\r\nCouncil] were to pay to his agent, or remit to him in such manner as he\r\nmight direct.\"\r\n\r\nThat, in the year 1772, the King Shah Allum, who had hitherto resided at\r\nAllahabad, trusting to engagements which he had entered into with the\r\nMahrattas, quitted that place, and removed to Delhi; but, having soon\r\nquarrelled with those people, and afterwards being taken prisoner, had\r\nbeen treated by them with very great disrespect and cruelty. That, among\r\nother instances of their abuse of their immediate power over him, the\r\nGovernor and Council of Bengal, in their letter of the 16th of August,\r\n1773, inform the Court of Directors that he had been _compelled, while a\r\nprisoner in their hands, to grant sunnuds for the surrender of Corah and\r\nAllahabad to them_; and it appears from sundry other minutes of their\r\nown that the said Governor and Council did at all times consider the\r\nsurrender above mentioned as _extorted_ from the King, and\r\n_unquestionably an act of violence_, which could not alienate or impair\r\nhis right to those provinces, and that, when they took possession\r\nthereof, it was at the request of the King's Naib, or viceroy, who put\r\nthem under the Council's _protection_. That on this footing they were\r\naccepted by the said Warren Hastings and his Council, and for some time\r\nconsidered by them as a deposit committed to their care by a prince to\r\nwhom the possession thereof was particularly guarantied by the East\r\nIndia Company. In their letter of the 1st of March, 1773, they (the said\r\nWarren Hastings and his Council) say, \"In no shape can this compulsatory\r\ncession by the King release us from the obligation we are under to\r\ndefend the provinces which we have so particularly guarantied to him.\"\r\nBut it appears that they soon adopted other ideas and assumed other\r\nprinciples concerning this object. In the instructions, dated the 23d of\r\nJune, 1773, which the Council of Fort William gave to the said Warren\r\nHastings, previous to his interview with the Nabob Sujah ul Dowlah at\r\nBenares, they say, that, \"while the King continued at Delhi, whither he\r\nproceeded in opposition to their most strenuous remonstrances, they\r\nshould certainly consider the engagements between him and the Company as\r\ndissolved by his alienation from them and their interest; that the\r\npossession of so remote a country could never be expected to yield any\r\nprofit to the Company, and the defence of it must require a perpetual\r\naid of their forces\": yet in the same instructions they declare their\r\nopinion, that, \"if the King should make overtures to renew his former\r\nconnection, _his right to reclaim the districts of Corah and Allahabad\r\ncould not with propriety be disputed_,\" and they authorize the said\r\nWarren Hastings to restore them to him _on condition that he should\r\nrenounce his claim to the annual tribute of twenty-six lac of rupees_,\r\nherein before mentioned, _and to the arrears which might be due_,\r\nthereby acknowledging the justice of a claim which they determined not\r\nto comply with but in return for the surrender of another equally\r\nvalid;--that, nevertheless, in the treaty concluded by the said Warren\r\nHastings with Sujah ul Dowlah on the 7th of September, 1773, it is\r\nasserted, that his Majesty, (meaning the King Shah Allum,) \"having\r\nabandoned the districts of Corah and Allahabad, and given a sunnud for\r\nCorah and Currah to the Mahrattas, had thereby forfeited his right to\r\nthe said districts,\" although it was well known to the said Warren\r\nHastings, and had been so stated by him to the Court of Directors, that\r\nthis surrender on the part of the King had been extorted from him by\r\nviolence, while he was a prisoner in the hands of the Mahrattas, and\r\nalthough it was equally well known to the said Warren Hastings that\r\nthere was nothing in the original treaty of 1765 which could restrain\r\nthe King from changing the place of his residence, consequently that his\r\nremoval to Delhi could not occasion a forfeiture of his right to the\r\nprovinces secured to him by that treaty.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, in the report which he made of his\r\ninterview and negotiations with Sujah ul Dowlah, dated the 4th of\r\nOctober, 1773, declared, \"that the administration would have been\r\nculpable in the highest degree in retaining possession of Corah and\r\nAllahabad _for any other purpose than that of making an advantage by the\r\ndisposal of them_,\" and therefore he had ceded them to the Vizier for\r\nfifty lac of rupees: a measure for which he had no authority whatever\r\nfrom the King Shah Allum, and in the execution of which no reserve\r\nwhatever was made in favor of the rights of that prince, nor any care\r\ntaken of his interests.\r\n\r\nThat the sale of these provinces to Sujah Dowlah involved the East India\r\nCompany in a triple breach of justice; since by the same act they\r\nviolated a treaty, they sold the property of another, and they alienated\r\na deposit committed to their friendship and good faith, and as such\r\naccepted by them. That a measure of this nature is not to be defended on\r\nmotives of policy and convenience, supposing such motives to have\r\nexisted, without a total loss of public honor, and shaking all security\r\nin the faith of treaties; but that in reality the pretences urged by the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings for selling the King's country to Sujah Dowlah were\r\nfalse and invalid. It could not strengthen our alliance with Sujah ul\r\nDowlah; since, paying a price for a purchase, he received no favor and\r\nincurred no obligation. It did not free the Company from all the dangers\r\nattending either a remote property or a remote connection; since, the\r\nmoment the country in question became part of Sujah Dowlah's dominions,\r\nit was included in the Company's former guaranty of those dominions, and\r\nin case of invasion the Company were obliged to send part of their army\r\nto defend it at the requisition of the said Sujah Dowlah; and if the\r\nremote situation of those provinces made the defence of them difficult\r\nand dangerous, much more was it a difficult and dangerous enterprise to\r\nengage the Company's force in an attack and invasion of the Rohillas,\r\nwhose country lay at a much greater distance from the Company's\r\nfrontier,--which, nevertheless, the said Warren Hastings agreed to and\r\nundertook at the very time when, under pretence of the difficulty of\r\ndefending Corah and Allahabad, he sold those provinces to Sujah Dowlah.\r\nIt did not relieve the Company from the _expense_ of defending the\r\ncountry; since the revenues thereof far exceeded the subsidy to be paid\r\nby Sujah Dowlah, and these revenues justly belonged to the Company as\r\nlong as the country continued under their protection, and would have\r\nanswered the expense of defending it. Finally, that the sum of fifty lac\r\nof rupees, stipulated with the said Sujah Dowlah, was inadequate to the\r\nvalue of the country, the annual revenues of which were stated at\r\ntwenty-five lac of rupees, which General Sir Robert Barker, then\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Company's forces, affirms _was certain, and\r\ntoo generally known to admit of a doubt_.\r\n\r\nThat the King Shah Allum received for some years the annual tribute of\r\ntwenty-six lac of rupees above mentioned, and was entitled to continue\r\nto receive it by virtue of an engagement deliberately, and for an\r\nadequate consideration, entered into with him by the Company's servants,\r\nand approved of and ratified by the Company themselves;--that this\r\nengagement was absolute and unconditional, and did neither express nor\r\nsuppose any case in which the said King should forfeit or the Company\r\nshould have a right to resume the tribute;--that, nevertheless, the said\r\nWarren Hastings and his Council, immediately after selling the King's\r\ncountry to Sujah Dowlah, resolved to withhold, and actually withheld,\r\nthe payment of the said tribute, of which the King Shah Allum has never\r\nsince received any part;--that this resolution of the Council is not\r\njustified even by themselves on principles of right and justice, but by\r\narguments of policy and convenience, by which the best founded claims\r\nof right and justice may at all times be set aside and defeated. \"They\r\njudged it highly impolitic and unsafe to answer the drafts of the King,\r\nuntil they were satisfied of his amicable intentions, and those of his\r\nnew allies.\" But neither had they any reason to question the King's\r\namicable intentions, nor was he pledged to answer for those of the\r\nMahrattas; his trusting to the good faith of that people, and relying on\r\ntheir assistance to reinstate him in the possession of his capital,\r\nmight have been imprudent and impolitic, but these measures, however\r\nruinous to himself, indicated no enmity to the English, nor were they\r\nproductive of any effects injurious to the English interests. And it is\r\nplain that the said Warren Hastings and his Council were perfectly aware\r\nthat their motives or pretences for withholding the tribute were too\r\nweak to justify their conduct, having principally insisted on the\r\nreduced state of their treasury, which, as they said, _rendered it\r\nimpracticable to comply with those payments_. The _right_ of a creditor\r\ndoes not depend on the circumstances of the debtor: on the contrary, the\r\nplea of inability includes a virtual acknowledgment of the debt; since,\r\nif the creditor's right were denied, the plea would be superfluous.\r\n\r\nThat the East India Company, having on their part violated the\r\nengagements and renounced the conditions on which they received and have\r\nhitherto held and enjoyed the duanné of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa from\r\nthe King Shah Allum, have thereby forfeited all right and title to the\r\nsaid duanné arising from the said grant, and that it is free and open to\r\nthe said King to resume such grant, and to transfer it to any other\r\nprince or state;--that, notwithstanding any distress or weakness to\r\nwhich he may be actually reduced, his lawful authority, as sovereign of\r\nthe Mogul Empire, is still acknowledged in India, and that his grant of\r\nthe duanné would sufficiently authorize and materially assist any prince\r\nor state that might attempt to dispossess the East India Company\r\nthereof, since it would convey a right which could not be disputed, and\r\nto which nothing but force could be opposed. Nor can these opinions be\r\nmore strongly expressed than they have been lately by the said Warren\r\nHastings himself, who, in a minute recorded the 1st of December, 1784,\r\nhas declared, that, \"fallen as the House of Timur is, it is yet the\r\nrelic of the most illustrious line of the Eastern world; that _its\r\nsovereignty is universally acknowledged_, though the substance of it no\r\nlonger exists; and that the Company itself derives its constitutional\r\ndominion from its ostensible bounty.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings by this declaration has renounced and\r\ncondemned the principle on which he avowedly acted towards the Mogul in\r\nthe year 1773, when he denied that the sunnuds or grants of the Mogul,\r\nif they were in the hands of another nation, would avail them\r\nanything,--and when he declared \"that the sword which gave us the\r\ndominion of Bengal must be the instrument of its preservation, and that,\r\nif it should ever cease to be ours, the next proprietor would derive his\r\n_right_ and possession from the same _natural charter_.\" That the said\r\nWarren Hastings, to answer any immediate purpose, adopts any principle\r\nof policy, however false or dangerous, without any regard to former\r\ndeclarations made, or to principles avowed on other occasions by\r\nhimself; and particularly, that in his conduct to Shah Allum he first\r\nmaintained that the grants of that prince were of no avail,--that we\r\nheld the dominion of Bengal by the sword, which he has falsely declared\r\nthe source of _right_, and the _natural charter_ of dominion,--whereas\r\nat a later period he has declared that the sovereignty of the family of\r\nShah Allum is universally acknowledged, and that the Company itself\r\nderives its constitutional dominion from their ostensible bounty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--BENARES.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS AND TITLES OF THE RAJAH OF BENARES.\r\n\r\nI. That the territory of Benares is a fruitful, and has been, not long\r\nsince, an orderly, well-cultivated, and improved province, of great\r\nextent; and its capital city, as Warren Hastings, Esquire, has informed\r\nthe Court of Directors, in his letter of the 21st of November, 1781, \"is\r\nhighly revered by the natives of the Hindoo persuasion, so that many who\r\nhave acquired independent fortunes retire to close their days in a place\r\nso eminently distinguished for its sanctity\"; and he further acquaints\r\nthe Directors, \"that it may rather be considered as the seat of the\r\nHindoo religion than as the capital of a province. But as its\r\ninhabitants are not composed of Hindoos only, the _former_ wealth which\r\nflowed into it from the offerings of pilgrims, as well as from the\r\ntransactions of exchange, for which its central situation is adapted,\r\nhas attracted numbers of Mahomedans, who still continue to reside in it\r\nwith their families.\" And these circumstances of the city of Benares,\r\nwhich not only attracted the attention of all the different\r\ndescriptions of men who inhabit Hindostan, but interested them warmly in\r\nwhatever it might suffer, did in a peculiar manner require that the\r\nGovernor-General and Council of Calcutta should conduct themselves with\r\nregard to its rulers and inhabitants, when it became dependent on the\r\nCompany, on the most distinguished principles of good faith, equity,\r\nmoderation, and mildness.\r\n\r\nII. That the Rajah Bulwant Sing, late prince or Zemindar of the province\r\naforesaid, was a great lord of the Mogul Empire, dependent on the same,\r\nthrough the Vizier of the Empire, the late Sujah ul Dowlah, Nabob of\r\nOude; and the said Bulwant Sing, in the commencement of the English\r\npower, did attach himself to the cause of the English Company; and the\r\nCourt of Directors of the said Company did acknowledge, in their letter\r\nof the 26th of May, 1768, that \"Bulwant Sing's joining us at the time he\r\ndid was of _signal service_, and the stipulation in his favor was what\r\nhe was justly entitled to\"; and they did commend \"the care that had been\r\ntaken [by the then Presidency] of those that had shown their attachment\r\nto them [the Company] during the war\"; and they did finally express\r\ntheir hope and expectation in the words following: \"The moderation and\r\nattention paid to those who have espoused our interests in this war will\r\n_restore_ our reputation in Hindostan, and that the Indian powers will\r\nbe convinced _NO breach of treaty will ever have our sanction_.\"\r\n\r\nIII. That the Rajah Bulwant Sing died on the 23d of August, 1770, and\r\nhis son, Cheyt Sing, succeeding to his rights and pretensions, the\r\nPresidency of Calcutta (John Cartier, Esquire, being then President) did\r\ninstruct Captain Gabriel Harper to procure a confirmation of the\r\nsuccession to his son Cheyt Sing, \"as it was of the utmost political\r\nimport to the Company's affairs; and that the young man ought not to\r\nconsider the price to be paid to satisfy _the Vizier's jealousy and\r\navarice_.\" And they did further declare as follows: \"The strong and\r\ninviolable attachment which subsisted betwixt the Company and the father\r\nmakes us most readily interpose our good offices for the son.\" And the\r\nyoung Rajah aforesaid having agreed, under the mediation of Captain\r\nHarper, to pay near two hundred thousand pounds as a gift to the said\r\nVizier, and to increase his tribute by near thirty thousand pounds\r\nannually, a deed of confirmation was passed by the said Vizier to the\r\nsaid Rajah and his heirs, by which he became a purchaser, for valuable\r\nconsiderations, of his right and inheritance in the zemindary aforesaid.\r\nIn consequence of this grant, so by him purchased, the Rajah was\r\nsolemnly invested with the government in the city of Benares, \"amidst\r\nthe acclamations of a numerous people, and to the great satisfaction of\r\nall parties.\" And the said Harper, in his letter of the 8th October,\r\n1770, giving an account of the investiture aforesaid, did express\r\nhimself in these words: \"I will leave the young Rajah and others to\r\nacquaint you how I have conducted myself; only thus much let me say,\r\nthat I have kept a strict eye not to diminish our national honor,\r\ndisinterestedness, and justice, which I will conclude has had a greater\r\neffect in securing to the Company their vast possessions than even the\r\nforce of arms, however formidable, could do.\" The President of Calcutta\r\ntestified his approbation of the said Harper's conduct in the strongest\r\nterms, that is, in the following: \"Your disinterestedness has been\r\nequally distinguishable as your abilities, and both do you the greatest\r\nhonor.\"\r\n\r\nIV. That the agreement between the Rajah and Nabob aforesaid continued\r\non both sides without any violation, under the sanction and guaranty of\r\nthe East India Company, for three years, when Warren Hastings, Esquire,\r\nbeing then President, did propose a further confirmation of the said\r\ngrant, and did, on the 12th of October, 1773, obtain a delegation for\r\nhimself to be the person to negotiate the same: it being his opinion, as\r\nexpressed in his report of October 4th, 1773, that the Rajah was not\r\nonly entitled to the inheritance of his zemindary by the grants through\r\nCaptain Harper, but that the preceding treaty of Allahabad, though\r\nliterally expressing no more than a security personal to Bulwant Sing,\r\ndid, notwithstanding, in the true sense and import thereof, extend to\r\nhis posterity; \"and that it had been differently understood\" (that is,\r\nnot literally) \"by the Company, and by this administration; and the\r\nVizier had _before_ put it out of all dispute by the solemn act passed\r\nin the Rajah's favor on his succession to the zemindary.\"\r\n\r\nV. That the Council, in their instructions to the said Governor\r\nHastings, did empower him \"to _renew_, in behalf of the Rajah Cheyt\r\nSing, the stipulation which was formerly made with the Vizier in\r\nconsideration of his services in 1764\"; and the government was\r\naccordingly settled on the Rajah and his posterity, or to his heirs, on\r\nthe same footing on which it was granted to his said father, excepting\r\nthe addition aforesaid to the tribute, with an express provision \"that\r\n_no increase_ shall ever hereafter be demanded.\" And the grant and\r\nstipulation aforesaid was further confirmed by the said Sujah ul Dowlah,\r\nunder the Company's guaranty, by the most solemn and awful form of oath\r\nknown in the Mahomedan religion, inserted in the body of the deed or\r\ngrant; and the said Warren Hastings, strongly impressed with the opinion\r\nof the propriety of protecting the Rajah, and of the injustice, malice,\r\nand avarice of the said Sujah Dowlah, and the known family enmity\r\nsubsisting between him and the Rajah, did declare, in his report to the\r\nCouncil, as follows: \"I am well convinced that the Rajah's inheritance,\r\nand perhaps his life, are no longer safe than while he enjoys the\r\nCompany's protection, which is his due by the ties of justice and the\r\nobligations of public faith.\"\r\n\r\nVI. That some time after the new confirmation aforesaid, that is to say,\r\nin the year 1774, the Governor-General and Council, which had been\r\nformed and the members thereof appointed by act of Parliament, did\r\nobtain the assignment of the sovereignty paramount of the said\r\ngovernment by treaty with the Nabob of Oude, by which, although the\r\nsupreme dominion was changed, the terms and the conditions of the tenure\r\nof the Rajah of Benares remained; as the said Nabob of Oude could\r\ntransfer to the East India Company no other or greater estate than he\r\nhimself possessed in or over the said zemindary. But to obviate any\r\nmisconstruction on the subject, the said Warren Hastings did propose to\r\nthe board, that, whatever provision might in the said treaty be made\r\nfor the interest of the Company, the same should be \"without an\r\nencroachment on the just rights of the Rajah, or _the engagements\r\nactually subsisting with him_.\"\r\n\r\nVII. That the said Warren Hastings, then having, or pretending to have,\r\nan extraordinary care of the interest of the Rajah of Benares, did, on\r\nhis transfer of the sovereignty, propose a new grant, to be conveyed in\r\nnew instruments to the said Rajah, conferring upon him further\r\nprivileges, namely, the addition of the sovereign rights of the mint,\r\nand of the right of criminal justice of life and death. And he, the said\r\nWarren Hastings, as Governor-General, did himself propose the resolution\r\nfor that purpose in Council, in the following words, with remarks\r\nexplanatory of the principles upon which the grants aforesaid were made,\r\nnamely:--\r\n\r\nMINUTE.\r\n\r\nVIII. \"That the perpetual and _independent_ possession of the zemindary\r\nof Benares and its dependencies be _confirmed_ and guarantied to the\r\nRajah Cheyt Sing and his heirs forever, _subject only to the annual\r\npayment of the revenues hitherto paid to the late Vizier_, amounting to\r\nBenares Sicca Rupees 23,71,656.12, to be disposed of as is expressed in\r\nthe following article: _That no other demand be made on him either by\r\nthe Nabob of Oude or this government; nor any kind of authority or\r\njurisdiction be exercised by either within the districts assigned him_.\"\r\nTo which minute he, the said Warren Hastings, did subjoin the following\r\nobservation in writing, and recorded therewith in the Council books,\r\nthat is to say: \"_The Rajah of Benares, from the situation of his\r\ncountry, which is a frontier to the provinces of Oude and Bahar, may be\r\nmade a serviceable ally to the Company, whenever their affairs shall\r\nrequire it. He has always been considered in this light both by the\r\nCompany and the successive members of the late Council; but to insure\r\nhis attachment to the Company, his interest must be connected with it,\r\nwhich cannot be better effected than by freeing him totally from the\r\nREMAINS of his present vassalage under the guaranty and protection of\r\nthe Company, and at the same time guarding him against any apprehensions\r\nfrom this government, by thus pledging its faith that no encroachment\r\nshall ever be made on his rights by the Company._\" And the said Warren\r\nHastings, on the 5th of July, 1775, did himself propose, among other\r\narticles of the treaty relative to this object, one of the following\r\ntenor: \"That, whilst the Rajah shall continue faithful to these\r\nengagements and punctual in his payments, and shall pay due obedience to\r\nthe authority of this government, _no more demands_ shall be made upon\r\nhim by the Honorable Company of ANY KIND, or, on any pretence\r\nwhatsoever, shall any person be allowed to interfere with his authority,\r\nor to disturb the peace of his country.\" And the said article was by the\r\nother members of the Council assented to without debate.\r\n\r\nIX. On transferring the Rajah's tribute from the Nabob to the Company,\r\nthe stipulation with the Nabob was renewed on the proposition of the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings himself, and expressed in a yet more distinct\r\nmanner, namely: \"That no more demands shall be made upon him by the\r\nHonorable Company of any kind.\" And the said Warren Hastings, in\r\njustification of his proposal of giving the Rajah \"a complete and\r\nuncontrolled authority over his zemindary,\" did enter on the Council\r\nbook the following reasons for investing him with the same, strongly\r\nindicating the situation in which he must be left under any other\r\ncircumstances, whether under the Nabob of Oude, or under the English, or\r\nunder the double influence of both: \"That the security of his person and\r\npossessions from the Company's protection may be rated equal to many\r\nlacs of rupees, _which, though saved to him, are no loss to the\r\ngovernment on which he depends, being all articles of invisible\r\nexpense_: in fees to the ministers and officers of the Nabob; in the\r\ncharges of a double establishment of vackeels to both governments; in\r\npresents and charges of accommodation to the Nabob, during his residence\r\nat any place within the boundaries of his zemindary; in _the frauds,\r\nembezzlements, and oppressions exercised in the mint and cutwally_;\r\nbesides the allowed profits of those officers, and the advantages which\r\nevery man _in occasional power, or in the credit of it, might make of\r\nthe Rajah's known weakness_, and the dread he stood in both of the\r\ndispleasure of the Nabob _and the ill-will of individuals among the\r\nEnglish, who were all considered, either in their present stations or\r\nconnections, or the right of succession, as members of the state of\r\nBengal_. It would be scarce possible to enumerate all the inconveniences\r\nto which the Rajah was liable _in his former situation_, or to estimate\r\nthe precise effect which they produced on his revenue and on the gross\r\namount of his expense; but it may be easily conceived that both were\r\nenormous, and of a nature the most likely to lessen the profits of\r\ngovernment, instead of adding to them.\" And in justification of his\r\nproposal of giving the Rajah the symbols of sovereignty in the power of\r\nlife and death, and in the coining of money, as pledges of his\r\n_independence_, he states the deplorable situation of princes reduced to\r\ndependence on the Vizier or the Company, and obliged to entertain an\r\nEnglish Resident at their court, in the following words: \"It is proposed\r\nto receive the payment of his [the Rajah's] rents at Patna, because that\r\nis the nearest provincial station, and because it would not frustrate\r\n_the intention of rendering the Rajah independent_. If a Resident was\r\nappointed to receive the money, as it became due, at Benares, _such a\r\nResident_ would unavoidably acquire an influence over the Rajah, and\r\nover his country, _which would in effect render him the master of both_.\r\nThis consequence might not perhaps be brought completely to pass without\r\n_a struggle and many appeals to the Council_, which, in a government\r\nconstituted like this, _cannot fail to terminate against the Rajah, and,\r\nby the construction to which his opposition to the agent would be\r\nliable, might eventually draw on him severe restrictions, and end in\r\nreducing him to the mean and depraved state of a mere zemindar_.\"\r\n\r\nX. That, in order to satisfy the said Rajah of the intentions of the\r\nCompany towards him, and of the true sense and construction of the\r\ngrants to him, the said Rajah, to be made, the Governor-General (he, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings) and Council did, on the 24th August, 1775,\r\ninstruct Mr. Fowke, the Resident at the Rajah's court, in the following\r\nwords: \"It is proper to assure the Rajah, we do not mean to increase his\r\ntribute, but to require from him an exact sum; that, under the\r\nsovereignty of the Company, we are determined to leave him the free and\r\nuncontrolled management of the internal government of his country, and\r\nthe collection and regulation of the revenues, so long as he adheres to\r\nthe terms of his engagement; and will _never_ demand _any_ augmentation\r\nof the annual tribute which may be fixed.\"\r\n\r\nXI. That the said Warren Hastings and the Council-General, not being\r\nsatisfied with having instructed the Resident to make the representation\r\naforesaid, to remove all suspicion that by the new grants any attempt\r\nshould insidiously be made to change his former tenure, did resolve that\r\na letter should be written by the Governor-General himself to the Rajah\r\nof Benares, to be delivered to Mr. Fowke, the Resident, together with\r\nhis credentials; in which letter they declare \"the board willing to\r\ncontinue the grant of the zemindary to him _in as full and ample a\r\nmanner as he possessed it from former sovereigns_; and on his paying the\r\nannual tribute,\" &c;--and in explaining the reasons for granting to him\r\nthe mint and criminal justice, they inform him that this is done in\r\norder \"that he may possess an _uncontrolled and free authority_ in the\r\nregulation and government of his zemindary.\"\r\n\r\nXII. That on the 26th February, 1776, the Board and Council did order\r\nthat the proper instruments should be prepared for conveying to the\r\nRajah aforesaid the government and criminal justice and mint of Benares,\r\nwith its dependencies, \"in the usual form, _expressing the conditions\r\nalready resolved on in the several proceedings of the board_.\" And on\r\nthe same day a letter was written to the Resident at Benares, signifying\r\nthat they had ordered the proper instruments to be prepared, specifying\r\nthe terms concerning the remittance of the Rajah's tribute to Calcutta,\r\nas well as \"_the several other conditions which had been already agreed\r\nto_,--and that they should forward it to him, to be delivered to the\r\nRajah.\" And on the 20th of March following, the board did again explain\r\nthe terms of the said tribute, in a letter to the Court of Directors,\r\nand did add, \"that a _sunnud_ [grant or patent] for his [Cheyt Sing's]\r\nzemindary should be furnished him _on these and the conditions before\r\nagreed on_.\"\r\n\r\nXIII. That during the course of the transactions aforesaid in Council,\r\nand the various assurances given to the Rajah and the Court of\r\nDirectors, certain improper and fraudulent practices were used with\r\nregard to the symbols of investiture which ought to have been given, and\r\nthe form of the deeds by which the said zemindary ought to have been\r\ngranted. For it appears that the original deeds were signed by the board\r\non the 4th September, 1775, and transmitted to Mr. Fowke, the Resident\r\nat the Rajah's court, and that on the 20th of November following the\r\nCourt of Directors were acquainted by the said Warren Hastings and the\r\nCouncil that Rajah Cheyt Sing had been invested with the _sunnud_\r\n(charters or patents) for his zemindary, and the _kellaut_, (or robes of\r\ninvestiture,) in all the proper forms; but on the 1st of October, 1775,\r\nthe Rajah did complain to the Governor-General and Council, that the\r\n_kellaut_, (or robes,) with which he was to be invested according to\r\ntheir order, \"_is not of the same kind_ as that which he received from\r\nthe late Vizier on the like occasion.\" In consequence of the said\r\ncomplaint, the board did, in their letter to the Resident of the 11th of\r\nthe same month, desire him \"to make inquiry respecting the nature of\r\nthe kellaut, and invest him with _one of the same sort_, on the part of\r\nthis government, instead of that which they formerly described to him.\"\r\nAnd it appears highly probable that the instruments which accompanied\r\nthe said robes of investiture were made in a manner conformable to the\r\norders and directions of the board, and the conditions by them agreed\r\nto; as the Rajah, who complained of the insufficiency of the robes, did\r\nmake no complaint of the insufficiency of the instruments, or of any\r\ndeviation in them from those he had formerly received from the Vizier.\r\n_But a copy or duplicate of the said deeds or instruments were in some\r\nmanner surreptitiously disposed of, and withheld from the records of the\r\nCompany, and never were transmitted to the Court of Directors._\r\n\r\nXIV. That several months after the said settlement and investiture,\r\nnamely, on the 15th of April, 1776, the Secretary informed the Court\r\nthat he had prepared a _sunnud_, _cabbolut_, and _pottah_ (that is, a\r\npatent, an agreement, and a rent-roll) for Cheyt Sing's zemindary, and\r\nthe board ordered the same to be executed; but the Resident, on\r\nreceiving the same, did transmit the several objections made by the\r\nRajah thereto, and particularly to a clause in the patent, made in\r\ndirect contradiction to the engagements of the Council so solemnly and\r\nrepeatedly given, by which clause the former patents _are declared to be\r\nnull_. That, on the representation aforesaid, on the 29th July, the\r\nSecretary was ordered to prepare new and proper instruments, _omitting\r\nthe clause declaring the former patents to be null_, and the said new\r\npatents were delivered to the Rajah; and the others, which he objected\r\nto, as well as those which had been delivered to him originally, were\r\nreturned to the Presidency. But neither the first set of deeds, nor the\r\nfraudulent patent aforesaid, nor the new instruments made out on the\r\ncomplaint of the Rajah, omitting the exceptionable words, have been\r\ninserted in the records, although it was the particular duty of the said\r\nWarren Hastings that all transactions with the country powers should be\r\nfaithfully entered, as well as to take care that all instruments\r\ntransmitted to them on the faith of the Company should be honestly,\r\ncandidly, and fairly executed, according to the true intent and meaning\r\nof the engagements entered into on the part of the Company,--giving by\r\nthe said complicated, artificial, and fraudulent management, as well as\r\nby his said omitting to record the said material document, strong reason\r\nto presume that he did even then meditate to make some evil use of the\r\ndeeds which he thus withheld from the Company, and which he did\r\nafterwards in reality make, when he found means and opportunity to\r\neffect his evil purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nDESIGNS OF MR. HASTINGS TO RUIN THE RAJAH OF BENARES.\r\n\r\nI. That the tribute transferred to the Company by the treaty with the\r\nNabob of Oude, being 250,000_l._ a year sterling, and upwards, without\r\nany deductions whatsoever, was paid monthly, with such punctual\r\nexactness as had no parallel in the Company's dealings with any of the\r\nnative princes or with any subject zemindar, being the only one who\r\nnever was in arrears; and according to all appearance, a perfect\r\nharmony did prevail between the Supreme Council at Calcutta and the\r\nRajah. But though the Rajah of Benares furnished no occasion of\r\ndispleasure to the board, yet it since appears that the said Warren\r\nHastings did, at some time in the year 1777, conceive displeasure\r\nagainst him. In that year, he, the said Warren Hastings, retracted his\r\nown act of resignation of his office, made to the Court of Directors\r\nthrough his agent, Mr. Macleane, and, calling in the aid of the military\r\nto support him in his authority, brought the divisions of the\r\ngovernment, according to his own expression, \"to an extremity bordering\r\non civil violence.\" This extremity he attributes, in a narrative by him\r\ntransmitted to the Court of Directors, and printed, not to his own fraud\r\nand prevarication, but to what he calls \"an attempt to wrest from him\r\nhis authority\"; and in the said narrative he pretends that the Rajah of\r\nBenares had deputed an agent with an express commission to his opponent,\r\nSir John Clavering. This fact, if it had been true, (which is not\r\nproved,) was in no sort criminal or offensive to the Company's\r\ngovernment, but was at first sight nothing more than a proper mark of\r\nduty and respect to the supposed succession of office. Nor is it\r\npossible to conceive in what manner it could offend the said Hastings,\r\nif he did not imagine that the express commission to which in the said\r\nnarrative he refers might relate to the discovery to Sir John Clavering\r\nof some practice which he might wish to conceal,--the said Clavering,\r\nwhom he styles \"_his opponent_,\" having been engaged, in obedience to\r\nthe Company's express orders, in the discovery of sundry peculations and\r\nother evil practices charged upon the said Hastings. But although, at\r\nthe time of the said pretended deputation, he dissembled his\r\nresentment, it appears to have rankled in his mind, and that he never\r\nforgave it, of whatever nature it might have been (the same never having\r\nbeen by him explained); and some years after, he recorded it in his\r\njustification of his oppressive conduct towards the Rajah, urging the\r\nsame with great virulence and asperity, as a proof or presumption of\r\nhis, the said Rajah's, disaffection to the Company's government; and by\r\nhis subsequent acts, he seems from the first to have resolved, when\r\nopportunity should occur, on a severe revenge.\r\n\r\nII. That, having obtained, in his casting vote, a majority in Council on\r\nthe death of Sir John Clavering and Mr. Monson, he did suddenly, and\r\nwithout any previous general communication with the members of the\r\nboard, by a Minute of Consultation of the 9th of July, 1778, make an\r\nextraordinary demand, namely: \"That the Rajah of Benares should\r\n_consent_ to the establishment of three regular battalions of sepoys,\r\n_to be raised and maintained at his own expense_\"; and the said expense\r\nwas estimated at between fifty and sixty thousand pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nIII. That the said requisition did suppose the _consent_ of the\r\nRajah,--the very word being inserted in the body of his, the said Warren\r\nHastings's, minute; and the same was agreed to, though with some doubts\r\non the parts of two of his colleagues, Mr. Francis and Mr. Wheler,\r\nconcerning the right of making the same, even worded as it was. But Mr.\r\nFrancis and Mr. Wheler, soon after, finding that the Rajah was much\r\nalarmed by this departure from the treaty, the requisition aforesaid was\r\nstrenuously opposed by them. The said Hastings did, notwithstanding\r\nthis opposition, persevere, and by his casting vote alone did carry the\r\nsaid unjust and oppressive demand. The Rajah submitted, after some\r\nmurmuring and remonstrance, to pay the sum required,--but on the express\r\ncondition (as has been frequently asserted by him to the said Warren\r\nHastings without any contradiction) that the exaction should continue\r\n_but for one year, and should not be drawn into precedent_. He also\r\nrequested that the extraordinary demand should be paid along with the\r\ninstalments of his monthly tribute: but although the said Warren\r\nHastings did not so much as pretend that the instant payment was at all\r\nnecessary, and though he was urged by his before-mentioned colleagues to\r\nmoderate his proceedings, he did insist upon immediate payment of the\r\nwhole; and did deliver his demand in proud and insulting language,\r\nwholly unfit for a governor of a civilized nation to use towards eminent\r\npersons in alliance with and in honorable and free dependence upon its\r\ngovernment; and did support the same with arguments full of\r\nunwarrantable passion, and with references to reports affecting merely\r\nhis own personal power and consideration, which reports were not proved,\r\nnor attempted to be proved, and, if proved, furnishing reasons\r\ninsufficient for his purpose, and indecent in any public proceedings.\r\nThat the said Hastings did cause the said sums of money to be rigorously\r\nexacted, although no such regular battalions as he pretended to\r\nestablish, as a color for his demand on the Rajah, were then raised, or\r\nany steps taken towards raising them; and when the said Rajah pleaded\r\nhis inability to pay the whole sum at once, he, the said Hastings,\r\npersevering in his said outrageous and violent demeanor, did order the\r\nResident to wait on the Rajah forthwith, and \"demand of him in person,\r\nand by writing, the full payment in specie to be made to him within five\r\ndays of such demand, and to declare to him, in the name of this\r\ngovernment, that his evading or neglecting to accomplish the payment\r\nthereof within that space of time should be deemed _equivalent to an\r\nabsolute refusal_; and in case of non-compliance with this [the\r\nResident's] demand, _we peremptorily enjoin you to refrain from all\r\nfurther intercourse with him_\": the said Hastings appearing by all his\r\nproceedings to be more disposed to bring on a quarrel with the Prince of\r\nBenares, than to provide money for any public service.\r\n\r\nIV. That the said demand was complied with, and the whole thereof paid\r\non the 10th of October that year. And the said Rajah did write to the\r\nsaid Hastings a letter, in order to mitigate and mollify him, declaring\r\nto the said Hastings that his sole reliance was on him, \"and that in\r\nevery instance he depended on his faith, religion, promises, and\r\nactions.\" But he, the said Warren Hastings, as if the being reminded of\r\nhis faith and promises were an incentive to him to violate the same,\r\nalthough he had agreed that his demand should not be drawn into\r\nprecedent, and the payment of the fifty thousand pounds aforesaid should\r\ncontinue only for one year, did, the very day after he had received the\r\nletter aforesaid, renew a demand of the same nature and on the same\r\npretence, this year even less plausible than the former, of three\r\nbattalions _to be_ raised. The said Rajah, on being informed of this\r\nrequisition, did remind the said Warren Hastings that he engaged in the\r\nlast year that but one payment should be made, and that he should not be\r\ncalled upon in future, and, pleading inability to discharge the new\r\ndemand, declared himself in the following words to the said Warren\r\nHastings: \"I am therefore hopeful you will be kindly pleased to excuse\r\nme the five lacs now demanded, and that nothing may be demanded of me\r\nbeyond the amount expressed in the pottah.\"\r\n\r\nV. That on the day after the receipt of this letter, that is, on the\r\n28th August, 1779, he, the said Warren Hastings, made a reply to the\r\nsaid letter; and without any remark whatsoever on the allegation of the\r\nRajah, stating to him his engagement, that he, the said Rajah, should\r\nnot be called upon in future, he says, \"I now repeat my demand, that you\r\ndo, on the receipt of this, without evasion or delay, pay the five lac\r\nof rupees into the hands of Mr. Thomas Graham, who has orders to receive\r\nit from you, and, in case of your refusal, to summon the two battalions\r\nof sepoys under the command of Major Camac to Benares, that measures may\r\nbe taken to oblige you to a compliance; and in this case, the whole\r\nexpense of the corps, from the time of its march, will fall on you.\"\r\n\r\nVI. That the said Rajah did a second and third time represent to the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings that he had broke his promise, and the said\r\nHastings did in no manner deny the same, but did, in contempt thereof,\r\nas well as of the original treaty between the Company and the Rajah,\r\norder two battalions of troops to march into his territories, and in a\r\nmanner the most harsh, insulting, and despotic, as if to provoke that\r\nprince to some act of resistance, did compel him to the payment of the\r\nsaid second unjust demand; and did extort also the sum of two thousand\r\npounds, on pretence of the charge of the troops employed to coerce him.\r\n\r\nVII. That the third year, that is to say, in the year 1780, the same\r\ndemand was, with the same menaces, renewed, and did, as before, produce\r\nseveral humble remonstrances and submissive complaints, which the said\r\nHastings did always treat as crimes and offences of the highest order;\r\nand although in the regular subsidy or tribute, which was monthly\r\npayable by treaty, fifty days of grace were allowed on each payment, and\r\nafter the expiration of the said fifty days one quarter par cent only\r\nwas provided as a penalty, he, the said Warren Hastings, on some short\r\ndelay of payment of his third arbitrary and illegal demand, did presume\r\nof his own authority to impose a fine or mulct of ten thousand pounds on\r\nthe said Rajah; and though it does not appear whether or no the same was\r\nactually levied, the said threat was soon after followed by an order\r\nfrom the said Hastings for the march of troops into the country of\r\nBenares, as in the preceding year.\r\n\r\nVIII. That, these violent and insulting measures failing to provoke the\r\nRajah, and he having paid up the whole demand, the said Warren Hastings,\r\nbeing resolved to drive him to extremities, did make on the said Rajah a\r\nsudden demand, over and above the ordinary tribute or subsidy of\r\n260,000_l._ per annum, and over and above the 50,000_l._ extraordinary,\r\nto provide a body of cavalry for the service of the Bengal government.\r\n\r\nIX. The demand, as expressed in the Minute of Consultation, and in the\r\npublic instructions of the board to the Resident to make the\r\nrequisition, is \"for such part of the cavalry entertained in his service\r\nas he can spare\"; and the demand is in this and in no other manner\r\ndescribed by the Governor-General and Council in their letter to the\r\nCourt of Directors. But in a Narrative of the said Warren Hastings's,\r\naddressed to Edward Wheler, Esquire, it appears, that, upon the Rajah's\r\nmaking difficulties, according to the representation of the said\r\nHastings, relative to the said requisition, the correspondence\r\nconcerning which the said Hastings hath fraudulently suppressed, he, the\r\nsaid Hastings, instead of adhering to the requisition of such cavalry\r\n_as the Rajah could spare_, and which was all that by the order of\r\nCouncil he was authorized to make, did, of his own private and arbitrary\r\nauthority, in some letter which he hath suppressed, instruct the\r\nResident, Markham, to make a peremptory demand for two thousand cavalry,\r\nwhich he well knew to be more than the Rajah's finances could support,\r\nestimating the provision for the same at 96,000_l._ a year at the\r\nlowest, though the expense of the same would probably have been much\r\nmore: which extravagant demand the said Hastings could only have made in\r\nhopes of provoking the Rajah to some imprudent measure or passionate\r\nremonstrance. And this arbitrary demand of cavalry was made, and\r\nperemptorily insisted on, although in the original treaty with the said\r\nRajah it was left entirely optional whether or not he should keep up any\r\ncavalry at all, and in the Minute of Consultation it was expressly\r\nmentioned to be thus optional, and that for whatsoever cavalry he, the\r\nsaid Rajah, should furnish, he should be paid fifteen rupees per month\r\nfor each private, and so in proportion for officers: yet the demand\r\naforesaid was made without any offer whatsoever of providing the said\r\npayment according to treaty.\r\n\r\nX. That the said Hastings did soon after, but upon what grounds does not\r\nappear by any Minute of Council, or from any correspondence contained in\r\nhis Narrative, reduce the demand to fifteen hundred, and afterwards to\r\none thousand: by which he showed himself to be sensible of the\r\nextravagance of his first requisition.\r\n\r\nXI. That, in consequence of these requisitions, as he asserts in his\r\nNarrative aforesaid, the Rajah \"did offer two hundred and fifty horse,\r\nbut sent none.\" But the said Hastings doth not accompany his said\r\nNarrative with any voucher or document whatever; and therefore the\r\naccount given by the Rajah, and delivered to the said Warren Hastings\r\nhimself, inserted by the said Warren Hastings himself in his Narrative,\r\nand in no part thereof attempted to be impeached, is more worthy of\r\ncredit: that is to say,--\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the horse, you desired me in your letter to inform you\r\nof what number I could afford to station with you. I sent you a\r\nparticular account of all that were in my service, amounting to one\r\nthousand three hundred horse, of which several were stationed at distant\r\nplaces; but I received no answer to this. Mr. Markham delivered me an\r\norder to prepare a thousand horse. In compliance with your wishes I\r\ncollected five hundred horse, and a substitute for the remainder, five\r\nhundred _burkundasses_ [matchlock-men], of which I sent you information;\r\nand I told Mr. Markham that they were ready to go to whatever place they\r\nshould be sent. No answer, however, came from you on this head, and I\r\nremained astonished at the cause of it. Repeatedly I asked Mr. Markham\r\nabout an answer to my letter about the horse; but he told me that he did\r\nnot know the reason of no answer having been sent. I remained\r\nastonished.\"\r\n\r\nXII. That the said Hastings is guilty of an high offence in not giving\r\nan answer to letters of such importance, and in concealing the said\r\nletters from the Court of Directors, as well as much of his\r\ncorrespondence with the Residents,--and more particularly in not\r\ndirecting to what place the cavalry and matchlock-men aforesaid should\r\nbe sent, when the Rajah had declared they were ready to go to whatever\r\nservice should be destined for them, and afterwards in maliciously\r\naccusing the Rajah for not having sent the same.\r\n\r\nXIII. That, on the 3d of February, 1781, a new demand for the support of\r\nthe three fictitious battalions of sepoys aforesaid was made by the said\r\nWarren Hastings; but whilst the Rajah was paying by instalments the said\r\narbitrary demand, the said Rajah was alarmed with some intelligence of\r\nsecret projects on foot for his ruin, and, being well apprised of the\r\nmalicious and revengeful temper of the said Hastings, in order to pacify\r\nhim, if possible, offered to redeem himself by a large ransom, to the\r\namount of two hundred thousand pounds sterling, to be paid for the use\r\nof the Company. And it appears that the said alarm was far from\r\ngroundless; for Major Palmer, one of the secret and confidential agents\r\nof the said Hastings, hath sworn, on the 4th of December, 1781, at the\r\ndesire of the said Warren Hastings, before Sir Elijah Impey, to the\r\nfollowing effect, that is to say: \"That the said Warren Hastings had\r\ntold him, the said Palmer, that he, the said Hastings, had rejected the\r\noffer of two hundred thousand pounds made by the Rajah of Benares for\r\nthe public service, and that he was resolved _to convert the faults\r\ncommitted by the Rajah into a public benefit_, and would exact the sum\r\nof five hundred thousand pounds, as a punishment for his breach of\r\nengagements with the government of Bengal, and acts of misconduct in his\r\nzemindary; and if the Rajah should absolutely refuse the demand, that he\r\nwould deprive him of his zemindary, or transfer the sovereignty thereof\r\nto the Nabob of Oude.\"\r\n\r\nXIV. And Mr. Anderson, in his declaration from Sindia's camp, of the 4th\r\nof January, 1782, did also, at the desire of Mr. Hastings, depose\r\n(though not on oath) concerning a conversation between him and the said\r\nHastings (but mentioning neither the time nor place where the same was\r\nheld); in which conversation, after reciting the allegations of the said\r\nHastings relative to several particulars of the delay and backwardness\r\nof the Rajah in paying the aforesaid extra demand, and his resolution to\r\nexact from the Rajah \"a considerable sum of money to the relief of the\r\nCompany's exigencies,\" he proceeds in the following words: \"That, if he\r\n[the Rajah] consented, you [the said Warren Hastings] were desirous of\r\n_establishing his possessions on the most permanent and eligible\r\nfooting_; but if he refused, you had it in your power to _raise a large\r\nsum_ for the Company by accepting an offer which had been made for his\r\ndistricts by the Vizier.\" And the said Anderson, in the declaration\r\naforesaid, made at the request of the said Hastings, and addressed to\r\nhim, expressed himself as follows: \"That you told me you had\r\ncommunicated our designs to Mr. Wheler [his only remaining colleague];\r\nand I believe, but I do not positively recollect, you said he concurred\r\nin them.\" But no trace of any such communication or concurrence did, at\r\nthe time referred to, or at any time ever after, appear on the\r\nConsultations, as it ought to have done; and the said Hastings is\r\ncriminal for having omitted to enter and record the proceeding. That the\r\nsaid Wheler did also declare, but a considerable time after the date of\r\nthe conversations aforesaid, that, \"on the eve of the Governor-General's\r\ndeparture, the said Hastings had told him that the Rajah's offences (not\r\nstating what offences, he having paid up all the demands, ordinary and\r\nextraordinary) _were declared_ to require early punishment; and as _his\r\nwealth was great, and the Company's exigencies pressing_, it was thought\r\na measure of policy and of justice to exact from him a large pecuniary\r\nmulct for their relief. The sum to which the Governor declared his\r\nresolution to extend the fine was forty _or_ fifty lacs; his ability to\r\npay it was stated as a fact that could not admit of a doubt; and the two\r\nalternatives on which the Governor declared himself to have resolved\r\nwere, to the best of my recollection, either a removal from his\r\nzemindary entirely, or, by taking immediate possession of all his\r\nforts, to obtain out of the treasure deposited in them the above sum for\r\nthe Company.\"\r\n\r\nXV. That in the declaration of the said Wheler the time of the\r\nconversation aforesaid is stated to be on the eve of the Governor's\r\ndeparture, and then said to be confidential; nor is it said or\r\ninsinuated that he knew or ever heard thereof at a more early period,\r\nthough it appears by Major Palmer's affidavit that the design of taking,\r\nnot four _or_ five, but absolutely five, hundred thousand pounds from\r\nthe Rajah, was communicated to him as early as the month of June. And it\r\ndoes not appear by the declarations of the said Wheler he did ever\r\ncasually or officially approve of the measure; which long concealment\r\nand late communication, time not being allowed to his colleague to\r\nconsider the nature and consequences of such a project, or to advise any\r\nprecaution concerning the same, is a high misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nXVI. That the said Hastings, having formed a resolution to execute one\r\nof the three violent and arbitrary resolutions aforesaid,--namely, to\r\nsell the Company's sovereignty over Benares to the Nabob of Oude, or to\r\ndispossess the Rajah of his territories, or to seize upon his forts, and\r\nto plunder them of the treasure therein contained, to the amount of four\r\nor five hundred thousand pounds,--did reject the offer of two hundred\r\nthousand pounds, tendered by the said Rajah for his redemption from the\r\ninjuries which he had discovered that the said Hastings had\r\nclandestinely meditated against him, although the sum aforesaid would\r\nhave been a considerable and seasonable acquisition at that time: the\r\nsaid Hastings being determined, at a critical period, to risk the\r\nexistence of the British empire, rather than fail in the gratification\r\nof his revenge against the said Rajah.\r\n\r\nXVII. That the first of his three instituted projects, namely, the\r\ndepriving the Rajah of his territories, was by himself considered as a\r\nmeasure likely to be productive of much odium to the British government:\r\nhe having declared, whatever opinions he might entertain of its justice,\r\n\"that it would have an appearance of _severity_, and might furnish\r\ngrounds _unfavorable to the credit of our government, and to his own\r\nreputation_, from the natural influence which every _act of rigor_,\r\nexercised in the persons of men in _elevated situations_, is apt to\r\nimpress on those who are too remote from the scene of action to judge,\r\nby any evidence of the facts themselves, of their motives or propriety.\"\r\nAnd the second attempt, the sum of money which he aimed at by attacking\r\nthe fortresses of the Rajah, and plundering them of the treasure\r\nsupposed to be there secured, besides the obvious uncertainty of\r\nacquiring what was thus sought, would be liable to the same imputations\r\nwith the former. And with regard to the third project, namely, the sale\r\nof the Company's sovereignty to the Nabob of Oude, and his having\r\nactually received proposals for the same, it was an high offence to the\r\nCompany, as presuming, without their authority or consent, to put up to\r\nsale their sovereign rights, and particularly to put them up to sale to\r\nthat very person against whom the independence of the said province had\r\nbeen declared by the Governor-General and Council to be necessary, as a\r\nbarrier for the security of the other provinces, in case of a future\r\nrupture with him.[59] It was an heinous injury to the said Rajah to\r\nattempt to change his relation without his consent, especially on\r\naccount of the person to whom he was to be made over for money, by\r\nreason of the known enmity subsisting between his family and that of the\r\nNabob, who was to be the purchaser; and it was a grievous outrage on the\r\ninnocent inhabitants of the zemindary of Benares to propose putting them\r\nunder a person long before described by himself to the Court of\r\nDirectors \"to want the qualities of the head and heart requisite for his\r\nstation\"; and a letter from the British Resident at Oude, transmitted to\r\nthe said Court, represents him \"to have wholly lost, by his\r\n_oppressions_, the confidence and affections of his own subjects\"; and\r\nwhose distresses, and the known disorders in his government, he, the\r\nsaid Hastings, did attribute solely to his own bad conduct and evil\r\ncharacter; admitting also, in a letter written to Edward Wheler,\r\nEsquire, and transmitted to the Court of Directors, \"that many\r\ncircumstances did favor suspicion of his [the said Nabob's] fidelity to\r\nthe English interest, the Nabob being surrounded by men base in their\r\ncharacters and improvident in their understandings, his favorites, and\r\nhis companions of his looser hours. These had every cause to dread the\r\neffect of my influence on theirs; and both these, and the relations of\r\nthe family, whose views of consequence and power were intercepted by our\r\nparticipation in the administration of his affairs, entertained a mortal\r\nhatred to our nation, and openly avowed it.\" And the said Hastings was\r\nwell aware, that, in case the Nabob, by him described in the manner\r\naforesaid, on making such purchase, should continue to observe the\r\nterms of his father's original covenants and engagements with the Rajah,\r\nand should pay the Company the only tribute which he could lawfully\r\nexact from the said Rajah, it was impossible that he could, for the mere\r\nnaked and unprofitable rights of a sovereignty paramount, afford to\r\noffer so great a sum as the Rajah did offer to the said Hastings for his\r\nredemption from oppression; such an acquisition to the Nabob (while he\r\nkept his faith) could not possibly be of any advantage whatever to him;\r\nand that therefore, if a great sum was to be paid by the Nabob of Oude,\r\nit must be for the purpose of oppression and violation of public faith,\r\nto be perpetrated in the person of the said Nabob, to an extent and in a\r\nmanner which the said Hastings was then apprehensive he could not\r\njustify to the Court of Directors as his own personal act.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nEXPULSION OF THE RAJAH OF BENARES.\r\n\r\nI. That the said Warren Hastings, being resolved on the ruin of the\r\nRajah aforesaid, as a preliminary step thereto, did, against the express\r\norders of the Court of Directors, remove Francis Fowke, Esquire, the\r\nCompany's Resident at the city of Benares, without any complaint or\r\npretence of complaint whatsoever, but merely on his own declaration that\r\nhe must have as a Resident at Benares a person of his own special and\r\npersonal nomination and confidence, and not a man of the Company's\r\nnomination,--and in the place of the said Francis Fowke, thus illegally\r\ndivested of his office, did appoint thereto another servant of the\r\nCompany of his own choice.\r\n\r\nII. That, soon after he had removed the Company's Resident, he prepared\r\nfor a journey to the upper provinces, and particularly to Benares, in\r\norder to execute the wicked and perfidious designs by him before\r\nmeditated and contrived: and although he did communicate his purpose\r\nprivately to such persons as he thought fit to intrust therewith, he did\r\nnot enter anything on the Consultations to that purpose, or record the\r\nprinciples, real or pretended, on which he had resolved to act, nor did\r\nhe state any guilt in the Rajah which he intended to punish, or charge\r\nhim, the said Rajah, with entertaining any hostile intentions, the\r\neffects of which were to be prevented by any strong measure; but, on the\r\ncontrary, he did industriously conceal his real designs from the Court\r\nof Directors, and did fallaciously enter on the Consultations a minute\r\ndeclaratory of purposes wholly different therefrom, and which supposed\r\nnothing more than an amicable adjustment, founded on the treaties\r\nbetween the Company and the Rajah, investing himself by his said minute\r\nwith \"full power and authority to form _such_ arrangements _with_ the\r\nRajah of Benares for the _better_ government and management of his\r\nzemindary, and to perform such acts for the improvement of the interest\r\nwhich the Company possesses in it, as he shall think _fit and consonant\r\nto the mutual engagements subsisting between the Company and the\r\nRajah_\"; and for this and other purposes he did invest himself with the\r\nwhole power of the Council, giving to himself an authority as if his\r\nacts had been the acts of the Council itself: which, though a power of a\r\ndangerous, unwarrantable, and illegal extent, yet does plainly imply the\r\nfollowing limits, namely, that the acts done should be _arranged with_\r\nthe Rajah, that is, _with his consent_; and, secondly, that they should\r\nbe consonant to the actual engagements between the parties; and nothing\r\nappears in the minute conferring the said power, which did express or\r\nimply any authority for depriving the Rajah of his government, or\r\nselling the sovereignty thereof to his hereditary enemy, or for the\r\nplunder of his fort-treasures.\r\n\r\nIII. That the said Warren Hastings, having formed the plans aforesaid\r\nfor the ruin of the Rajah, did set out on a journey to the city of\r\nBenares with a great train, but with a very small force, not much\r\nexceeding six companies of regular black soldiers, to perpetrate some of\r\nthe unjust and violent acts by him meditated and resolved on; and the\r\nsaid Hastings was met, according to the usage of distinguished persons\r\nin that country, by the Rajah of Benares with a very great attendance,\r\nboth in boats and on shore, which attendance he did apparently intend as\r\na mark of honor and observance to the place and person of the said\r\nHastings, but which the said Hastings did afterwards groundlessly and\r\nmaliciously represent as an indication of a design upon his life; and\r\nthe said Rajah came into the pinnace in which the said Hastings was\r\ncarried, and in a lowly and suppliant manner, alone, and without any\r\nguard or attendance whatsoever, entreated his favor; and being received\r\nwith great sternness and arrogance, he did put his turban in the lap of\r\nthe said Hastings, thereby signifying that he abandoned his life and\r\nfortune to his disposal, and then departed, the said Hastings not\r\napprehending, nor having any reason to apprehend, any violence\r\nwhatsoever to his person.\r\n\r\nIV. That the said Hastings, in the utmost security and freedom from\r\napprehension, did pursue his journey, and did arrive at the city of\r\nBenares on the 14th of August, 1781, some hours before the Rajah, who,\r\nsoon after his arrival, intended to pay him a visit of honor and respect\r\nat his quarters, but was by the said Hastings rudely and insolently\r\nforbid, until he should receive his permission. And the said Hastings,\r\nalthough he had previously determined on the ruin of the said Rajah, in\r\norder to afford some color of regularity and justice to his proceedings,\r\ndid, on the day after his arrival, that is, on the 15th day of August,\r\n1781, send to the Rajah a charge in writing, which, though informal and\r\nirregular, may be reduced to four articles, two general, and two more\r\nparticular: the first of the general being, \"That he [the Rajah] had, by\r\nthe means of his secret agents, endeavored to excite disorders in the\r\ngovernment on which he depended\"; the second, \"That he had suffered the\r\n_daily_ perpetration of robberies and murders, even in the streets of\r\nBenares, to the great and public scandal of the English name.\"\r\n\r\nV. That it appears that the said Warren Hastings is guilty of an high\r\noffence, contrary to the fundamental principles of justice, in the said\r\nmode of charging misdemeanors, without any specification of person or\r\nplace or time or act, or any offer of specification or proofs by which\r\nthe party charged may be enabled to refute the same, in order to\r\nunjustly load his reputation, and to prejudice him with regard to the\r\narticles more clearly specified.\r\n\r\nVI. That the two specified articles relate to certain delays: the\r\nfirst, with regard to the payment of the sums of money unjustly extorted\r\nas aforesaid; and the second, the non-compliance with a requisition of\r\ncavalry,--which non-compliance the said Hastings (even if the said\r\ncharges had been founded) did falsely, and in contradiction to all law,\r\naffirm and maintain (in his accusation against the Rajah, and addressing\r\nhimself to him) \"to amount to a _direct_ charge of disaffection and\r\n_infidelity_ to the government on which you depend\": and further\r\nproceeded as follows: \"I therefore judged it proper to state them [the\r\nsaid charges] thus fully to you in writing, and to _require_ your\r\nanswer; and this I expect _immediately_.\" That the said Hastings,\r\nstating his pretended facts to amount to a charge of the nature (as he\r\nwould have it understood) of high treason, and _therefore_ calling for\r\nan _immediate_ answer, did wilfully act against the rules of natural\r\njustice, which requires that a convenient time should be given to\r\nanswer, proportioned to the greatness of the offence alleged, and the\r\nheavy penalties which attend it; and when he did arrogate to himself a\r\nright both to charge and to judge in his own person, he ought to have\r\nallowed the Rajah full opportunity for conferring with his ministers,\r\nhis doctors of law, and his accountants, on the facts charged, and on\r\nthe criminality inferred in the said accusation of disloyalty and\r\ndisaffection, or offences of that quality.\r\n\r\nVII. That the said Rajah did, under the pressure of the disadvantages\r\naforesaid, deliver in, upon the very evening of the day of the charge, a\r\nfull, complete, and specific answer to the two articles therein\r\nspecified; and did allege and offer proof that the whole of the\r\nextraordinary demands of the said Hastings had been actually long before\r\npaid and discharged; and did state a proper defence, with regard to the\r\ncavalry, even supposing him bound (when he was not bound) to furnish\r\nany. And the said Rajah did make a direct denial of the truth, of the\r\ntwo _general_ articles, and did explain himself on the same in as\r\nsatisfactory a manner and as fully as their nature could permit,\r\noffering to enter into immediate trial of the points in issue between\r\nhim and the said Hastings, in the remarkable words following. \"My\r\nenemies, with a view to my ruin, have made false representations to you.\r\nNow that, _happily for me_, you have yourself arrived at this place, you\r\nwill be able to ascertain all the circumstances: first, relative to the\r\nhorse; secondly, to my people going to Calcutta; and thirdly, the dates\r\nof the receipts of the particular sums above mentioned. You will then\r\nknow whether I have amused you with a false representation, or made a\r\njust report to you.\" And in the said answer the said Rajah complained,\r\nbut in the most modest terms, of an injury to him of the most dangerous\r\nand criminal nature in transactions of such moment, namely, his not\r\nreceiving any answer to his letters and petitions, and concluded in the\r\nfollowing words. \"I have never swerved in the smallest degree from my\r\nduty to you. It remains with you to decide on all these matters. I am in\r\nevery case your slave. What is just I have represented to you. May your\r\nprosperity increase!\"\r\n\r\nVIII. That the said Warren Hastings was bound by the essential\r\nprinciples of natural justice to attend to the claim made by the Rajah\r\nto a fair and impartial trial and inquiry into the matter of accusation\r\nbrought against him by the said Hastings, at a time and place which\r\nfurnished all proper materials and the presence of all necessary\r\nwitnesses; but the said Hastings, instead of instituting the said\r\ninquiry and granting trial, did receive an humble request for justice\r\nfrom a great prince as a fresh offence, and as a personal insult to\r\nhimself, and did conceive a violent passion of anger and a strong\r\nresentment thereat, declaring that he did consider the said answer as\r\nnot only unsatisfactory in substance, but offensive in style. \"This\r\nanswer you will perceive to be not only unsatisfactory in substance, but\r\noffensive in style, and less a vindication of himself than a\r\nrecrimination on me. It expresses no concern for the causes of complaint\r\ncontained in my letter, or desire to atone for them, nor the smallest\r\nintention to pursue a different line of conduct. An answer couched\r\nnearly _in terms of defiance_ to requisitions of so serious a nature I\r\ncould not but consider as _a strong indication of that spirit of\r\nindependency_ which the Rajah has for some years past assumed, and of\r\nwhich indeed I had early observed other manifest symptoms, both before\r\nand from the instant of my arrival.\" Which representation is altogether\r\nand in all parts thereof groundless and injurious; as the substance of\r\nthe answer is a justification proper to be pleaded, and the style, if in\r\nanything exceptionable, it is in its extreme humility, resulting rather\r\nfrom an unmanly and abject spirit than from anything of an offensive\r\nliberty; but being received as disrespectful by the said Hastings, it\r\nabundantly indicates the tyrannical arrogance of the said Hastings, and\r\nthe depression into which the natives are sunk under the British\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIX. That the said Warren Hastings, pretending to have been much alarmed\r\nat the offensive language of the said Rajah's defence, and at certain\r\nappearances of independency which he had observed, not only on former\r\noccasions, but since his arrival at Benares, (where he had been but\r\nlittle more than one day,) and which appearances he never has specified\r\nin any one instance, did assert that he conceived himself indispensably\r\nobliged to adopt some decisive plan; and without any farther inquiry or\r\nconsultation (which appears) with any person, did, at ten o'clock of the\r\nvery night on which he received the before-mentioned full and\r\nsatisfactory as well as submissive answer, send an order to the British\r\nResident (then being a public minister representing the British\r\ngovernment at the court of the said Rajah, and as such bound by the law\r\nof nations to respect the prince at whose court he was Resident, and not\r\nto attempt anything against his person or state, and who ought not,\r\ntherefore, to have been chosen by the said Hastings, and compelled to\r\nserve in that business) that he should on the next morning arrest the\r\nsaid prince in his palace, and keep him in his custody until further\r\norders; which said order being conceived in the most peremptory terms,\r\nthe Rajah was put under arrest, with a guard of about thirty orderly\r\nsepoys, with their swords drawn; and the particulars thereof were\r\nreported to him as follows.\r\n\r\n\"HONORABLE SIR,--I this morning, in obedience to your orders of last\r\nnight, proceeded with a few of my orderlies, accompanied by Lieutenant\r\nStalker, to Shewalla Ghaut, the present residence of Rajah Cheyt Sing,\r\nand acquainted him it was your pleasure he should consider himself in\r\narrest; that he should order his people to behave in a quiet and orderly\r\nmanner, for that any attempt _to rescue him would be attended with his\r\nown destruction. The Rajah submitted quietly to the arrest_, and assured\r\nme, that, whatever were your orders, he was ready implicitly to obey; he\r\nhoped that you would allow him a _subsistence_, but as for _his\r\nzemindary, his forts, and his treasure, he was ready to lay them at your\r\nfeet, and his life, if required_. He expressed himself much hurt at the\r\nignominy which he affirmed must be the consequence of his confinement,\r\nand entreated me to return to you with the foregoing submission, hoping\r\nthat you would make allowances for his youth and inexperience, and in\r\nconsideration of his father's name release him from his confinement, as\r\nsoon as he should prove the sincerity of his offers, and himself\r\ndeserving of your compassion and forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\nX. That a further order was given, that every servant of the Rajah's\r\nshould be disarmed, and a certain number only left to attend him under a\r\nstrict watch. In a quarter of an hour after this conversation, two\r\ncompanies of grenadier sepoys were sent to the Rajah's palace by the\r\nsaid Hastings; and the Rajah, being dismayed by this unexpected and\r\nunprovoked treatment, wrote two short letters or petitions to the said\r\nHastings, under the greatest apparent dejection at the outrage and\r\ndishonor he had suffered in the eyes of his subjects, (all imprisonment\r\nof persons of rank being held in that country as a mark of indelible\r\ninfamy, and he also, in all probability, considering his imprisonment as\r\na prelude to the taking away his life,) and in the first of the said\r\npetitions he did express himself in this manner: \"Whatever may be your\r\npleasure, do it with your own hands; I am your slave. What occasion can\r\nthere be for a guard?\" And in the other: \"My honor was bestowed upon me\r\nby your Highness. It depends on you alone to take away or not to take\r\naway the country out of my hands. In case my honor is not left to me,\r\nhow shall I be equal to the business of the government? Whoever, with\r\nhis hands in a supplicating posture, is ready with his life and\r\nproperty, what necessity can there be for him to be dealt with in this\r\nway?\"\r\n\r\nXI. That, according to the said Hastings's narrative of this\r\ntransaction, he, the said Hastings, on account of the apparent\r\ndespondency in which these letters were written, \"thought it _necessary_\r\nto give him _some_ encouragement,\" and therefore wrote him a note of a\r\nfew lines, carelessly and haughtily expressed, and little calculated to\r\nrelieve him from his uneasiness, promising to send to him a person to\r\nexplain particulars, and desiring him \"to set his mind at rest, and not\r\nto conceive any terror or apprehension.\" To which an answer of great\r\nhumility and dejection was received.\r\n\r\nXII. That the report of the Rajah's arrest did cause a great alarm in\r\nthe city, in the suburbs of which the Rajah's palace is situated, and in\r\nthe adjacent country. The people were filled with dismay and anger at\r\nthe outrage and indignity offered to a prince under whose government\r\nthey enjoyed much ease and happiness. Under these circumstances the\r\nRajah desired leave to perform his ablutions; which was refused, unless\r\nhe sent for water, and performed that ceremony on the spot. This he\r\ndid. And soon after some of the people, who now began to surround the\r\npalace in considerable numbers, attempting to force their way into the\r\npalace, a British officer, commanding the guard upon the Rajah, struck\r\none of them with his sword. The people grew more and more irritated; but\r\na message being sent from the Rajah to appease them, they continued, on\r\nthis interposition, for a while quiet. Then the Rajah retired to a sort\r\nof stone pavilion, or bastion, to perform his devotions, the guard of\r\nsepoys attending him in this act of religion. In the mean time a person\r\nof the meanest station, called a _chubdar_, at best answering to our\r\ncommon beadle or tipstaff, was sent with a message (of what nature does\r\nnot appear) from Mr. Hastings, or the Resident, to the prince under\r\narrest: and this base person, without regard to the rank of the\r\nprisoner, or to his then occupation, addressed him in a rude, boisterous\r\nmanner, \"passionately and insultingly,\" (as the said Rajah has without\r\ncontradiction asserted,) \"and, reviling him with a loud voice, gave both\r\nhim and his people the vilest abuse\"; and the manner and matter being\r\nobservable and audible to the multitude, divided only by an open stone\r\nlattice from the scene within, a firing commenced from without the\r\npalace; on which the Rajah again interposed, and did what in him lay to\r\nsuppress the tumult, until, an English officer striking him with a\r\nsword, and wounding him on the hand, the people no longer kept any\r\nmeasures, but broke through the inclosure of the palace. The insolent\r\ntipstaff was first cut down, and the multitude falling upon the sepoys\r\nand the English officers, the whole, or nearly the whole, were cut to\r\npieces: the soldiers having been ordered to that service without any\r\ncharges for their pieces. And in this tumult, the Rajah, being justly\r\nfearful of falling into the hands of the said Hastings, did make his\r\nescape over the walls of his palace, by means of a rope formed of his\r\nturban tied together, into a boat upon the river, and from thence into a\r\nplace of security; abandoning many of his family to the discretion of\r\nthe said Hastings, who did cause the said palace to be occupied by a\r\ncompany of soldiers after the flight of the Rajah.\r\n\r\nXIII. That the Rajah, as soon as he had arrived at a place of refuge,\r\ndid, on the very day of his flight, send a suppliant letter to the said\r\nHastings, filled with expressions of concern (affirmed by the said\r\nHastings to be slight expressions) for what had happened, and\r\nprofessions (said by the said Hastings to be indefinite and unapplied)\r\nof fidelity: but the said Warren Hastings, though bound by his duty to\r\nhear the said Rajah, and to prevent extremities, if possible, being\r\nfilled with insolence and malice, did not think it \"_becoming_ of him to\r\nmake any reply to it; and that he _thought_ he ordered the bearer of the\r\nletter to be told that _it required none_.\"\r\n\r\nXIV. That this letter of submission having been received, the said\r\nRajah, not discouraged or provoked from using every attempt towards\r\npeace and reconciliation, did again apply, on the very morning\r\nfollowing, to Richard Johnson, Esquire, for his interposition, but to no\r\npurpose; and did likewise, with as little effect, send a message to\r\nCantoo Baboo, native steward and confidential agent of the said\r\nHastings, which was afterwards reduced into writing, \"to exculpate\r\nhimself from any concern in what had passed, and to profess his\r\nobedience to his _will_ [Hastings's] _in whatever_ way he should\r\ndictate.\" But the said Hastings, for several false and contradictory\r\nreasons by him assigned, did not take any advantage of the said opening,\r\nattributing the same to artifice in order to gain time; but instead of\r\naccepting the said submissions, he did resolve upon flight from the city\r\nof Benares, and did suddenly fly therefrom in great confusion.\r\n\r\nXV. That the said Hastings did persevere in his resolutions not to\r\nlisten to any submission or offer of accommodation whatsoever, though\r\nseveral were afterwards made through almost every person who might be\r\nsupposed to have influence with him, but did cause the Rajah's troops to\r\nbe attacked and fallen upon, though they only acted on the defensive,\r\n(as the Rajah has without contradiction asserted,) and thereby, and by\r\nhis preceding refusal of propositions of the same nature, and by other\r\nhis perfidious, unjust, and tyrannical acts by him perpetrated and done,\r\nand by his total improvidence in not taking any one rational security\r\nwhatsoever against the inevitable consequences of those acts, did make\r\nhimself guilty of all the mutual slaughter and devastation which ensued,\r\nas well as, in his opinion, of the imminent danger of the total\r\nsubversion of the British power in India by the risk of his own person,\r\nwhich he asserts that it did run,--as also \"that it ought not to be\r\nthought that he attributed too much consequence to his personal safety,\r\nwhen he supposed _the fate of the British empire in India connected with\r\nit_, and that, mean as its substance may be, its accidental qualities\r\nwere equivalent to those which, like the characters of a talisman in\r\nthe Arabian mythology, formed the _essence_ of the state itself,\r\nrepresentation, title, and the _estimate_ of the public opinion; that,\r\nhad he fallen, such a stroke would be universally considered as decisive\r\nof the national fate; every state round it would have started into arms\r\nagainst it, and _every subject of its own dominion would, according to\r\ntheir several abilities, have become its enemy_\": and that he knew and\r\nhas declared, that, though the said stroke was not struck, that great\r\nconvulsions did actually ensue from his proceedings, \"that half the\r\nprovince of Oude was in a state of as complete rebellion as that of\r\nBenares,\" and that invasions, tumults, and insurrections were occasioned\r\nthereby in various other parts.\r\n\r\nXVI. That the said Warren Hastings, after he had collected his forces\r\nfrom all parts, did, with little difficulty or bloodshed, subsequent to\r\nthat time, on the part of his troops, and in a few days, entirely reduce\r\nthe said province of Benares; and did, after the said short and little\r\nresisted hostility, in cold blood, issue an order for burning a certain\r\ntown, in which he accused the people at large of having killed, \"upon\r\nwhat provocation he knows not,\" certain wounded sepoys, who were\r\nprisoners: which order, being _generally_ given, when it was his duty to\r\nhave made some inquiry concerning the particular offenders, but which he\r\ndid never make, or cause to be made, was cruel, inhuman, and tended to\r\nthe destruction of the revenues of the Company; and that this, and other\r\nacts of devastation, did cause the loss of two months of the\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nXVII. That the said Warren Hastings did not only refuse the submissions\r\nof the said Rajah, which were frequently repeated through various\r\npersons after he had left Benares, and even after the defeat of certain\r\nof the Company's forces, but did proscribe and except him from the\r\npardons which he issued after he had satisfied his vengeance on the\r\nprovince of Benares.\r\n\r\nXVIII. That the said Warren Hastings did send to a certain castle,\r\ncalled Bidzigur, the residence of a person of high rank, called Panna,\r\nthe mother of the Rajah of Benares, with whom his wife, a woman\r\ndescribed by the said Hastings \"to be of an amiable character,\" and all\r\nthe other women of the Rajah's family, and the survivors of the family\r\nof his father, Bulwant Sing, did then reside, a body of troops to\r\ndispossess them of her said residence, and to seize upon her money and\r\neffects, although she did not stand, even by himself, accused of any\r\noffence whatsoever,--pretending, but not proving, and not attempting to\r\nprove, then nor since, that the treasures therein contained were the\r\nproperty of the Rajah, and not her own; and did, in order to stimulate\r\nthe British soldiery to rapine and outrage, issue to them several\r\nbarbarous orders, contrary to the practice of civilized nations,\r\nrelative to their property, movable and immovable, attended with\r\nunworthy and unbecoming menaces, highly offensive to the manners of the\r\nEast and the particular respect there paid to the female sex,--which\r\nletters and orders, as well as the letters which he had received from\r\nthe officers concerned, the said Hastings did unlawfully suppress, until\r\nforced by the disputes between him and the said officers to discover\r\nthe same: and the said orders are as follow.\r\n\r\n\"I am this instant favored with yours of yesterday. Mine of the same\r\ndate [22d October, 1781] has before this time acquainted you with my\r\nresolutions and sentiments respecting the Rannee [the mother of the\r\nRajah Cheyt Sing]. I think every demand she has made to you, except that\r\nof safety and respect for her person, is unreasonable. If the reports\r\nbrought to me are true, _your rejecting her offers, or any negotiations\r\nwith her_, would soon obtain you possession of the fort upon your own\r\nterms. I apprehend that she will contrive _to defraud the captors of a\r\nconsiderable part of the booty by being suffered to retire without\r\nexamination. But this is your consideration, and not mine. I should be\r\nvery sorry that your officers and soldiers lost ANY PART of the reward\r\nto which they are so well entitled_; but I cannot make any objection, as\r\nyou must be the best judge of the expediency of the _promised_\r\nindulgence to the Rannee. What you have engaged for I will certainly\r\nratify; but as to permitting the Rannee to hold the purgunnah of Hurluk,\r\nor any other in the zemindary, without being subject to the authority of\r\nthe zemindar, or any lands whatever, _or indeed making any conditions\r\nwith her for a provision, I will never consent to it_.\" And in another\r\nletter to the same person, dated Benares, 3d of November, 1781, in which\r\nhe, the said Hastings, consents that the said woman of distinction\r\nshould be allowed to evacuate the place and to receive protection, he\r\ndid express himself as follows. \"I am willing to grant her now the same\r\nconditions to which I at first consented, provided that she delivers\r\ninto your possession, within twenty-four hours from the time of\r\nreceiving your message, the fort of Bidzigur, with the treasure and\r\neffects lodged therein by Cheyt Sing or any of his adherents, with the\r\nreserve only, as above mentioned, of such articles _as you shall think\r\nnecessary to her sex and condition_, or as you shall be disposed _of\r\nyourself to indulge her with_. If she complies, as I expect she will, it\r\nwill be your part to secure the fort and the property it contains _for\r\nthe benefit of yourself and detachment_. I have only further to request\r\nthat you will grant an escort, if Panna should require it, to conduct\r\nher here, or wherever she may choose to retire to. But should she refuse\r\nto execute the promise she has made, _or delay it beyond the term of\r\ntwenty-four hours_, it is my _positive_ injunction that you immediately\r\nput a stop to any further intercourse or negotiation with her, and on no\r\npretext renew it. If she disappoints _or trifles_ with me, after I have\r\nsubjected my duan to the disgrace of returning ineffectually, and of\r\ncourse myself to discredit, I shall consider it as a _wanton affront and\r\nindignity which I can never forgive_, nor will I grant her any\r\nconditions whatever, but leave her exposed to _those dangers_ which she\r\nhas chosen to risk rather than trust to the clemency and generosity of\r\nour government. I think _she cannot be ignorant of these consequences,\r\nand will not venture to incur them_; and it is for this reason I place a\r\ndependence on her offers, and have consented to send my duan to her.\"\r\n\r\nXIX. That the castle aforesaid being surrendered upon terms of safety,\r\nand on express condition of not attempting to search their persons, the\r\nwoman of rank aforesaid, her female relations and female dependants, to\r\nthe number of three hundred, besides children, evacuated the said\r\ncastle; but the spirit of rapacity being excited by the letters and\r\nother proceedings of the said Hastings, the capitulation was shamefully\r\nand outrageously broken, and, in despite of the endeavors of the\r\ncommanding officer, the said woman of high condition, and her female\r\ndependants, friends, and servants, were plundered of the effects they\r\ncarried with them, and which were reserved to them in the capitulation\r\nof their fortress, and in their persons were otherwise rudely and\r\ninhumanly dealt with by the licentious followers of the camp: for which\r\noutrages, represented to the said Hastings with great concern by the\r\ncommanding officer, Major Popham, he, the said Hastings, did afterwards\r\nrecommend a late and fruitless redress.\r\n\r\nXX. That the Governor-General, Warren Hastings, in exciting the hopes of\r\nthe military by declaring them _well entitled to the plunder_ of the\r\nfortress aforesaid, the residence of the mother and other women of the\r\nRajah of Benares, and by wishing the troops to secure the same for their\r\nown benefit, did advise and act in direct contradiction to the orders of\r\nthe Court of Directors, and to his own opinion of his public duty, as\r\nwell as to the truth and reality thereof,--he having some years before\r\nentered in writing the declaration which follows.\r\n\r\n\"The very idea of _prize-money_ suggests to my remembrance _the former\r\ndisorders which arose in our army from this source, and had almost\r\nproved fatal to it_. Of this circumstance you must be sufficiently\r\napprised, and of the necessity for discouraging every expectation of\r\nthis kind amongst the troops. _It is to be avoided like poison._ The bad\r\neffects of a similar measure were but too plainly felt in a former\r\nperiod, and our honorable masters did not fail on that occasion to\r\nreprobate with their censure, in the most severe terms, a practice which\r\nthey regarded as the source of infinite evils, and which, if\r\nestablished, would in their judgment necessarily bring corruption and\r\nruin on their army.\"\r\n\r\nXXI. That the said Hastings, after he had given the license aforesaid,\r\nand that in consequence thereof the booty found in the castle, to the\r\namount of 23,27,813 current rupees, was distributed among the soldiers\r\nemployed in its reduction, the said Hastings did retract his declaration\r\nof right, and his permission to the soldiers to appropriate to\r\nthemselves the plunder, and endeavored, by various devices and\r\nartifices, to explain the same away, and to recover the spoil aforesaid\r\nfor the use of the Company; and wholly failing in his attempts to resume\r\nby a breach of faith with the soldiers what he had unlawfully disposed\r\nof by a breach of duty to his constituents, he attempted to obtain the\r\nsame as a loan, in which attempt he also failed; and the aforesaid money\r\nbeing the only part of the treasures belonging to the Rajah, or any of\r\nhis family, that had been found, he was altogether frustrated in the\r\nacquisition of every part of that dishonorable object which alone he\r\npretended to, and pursued through a long series of acts of injustice,\r\ninhumanity, oppression, violence, and bloodshed, at the hazard of his\r\nperson and reputation, and, in his own opinion, at the risk of the total\r\nsubversion of the British empire.\r\n\r\nXXI. That the said Warren Hastings, after the commission of the\r\noffences aforesaid, being well aware that he should be called to an\r\naccount for the same, did, by the evil counsel and agency of Sir Elijah\r\nImpey, Knight, his Majesty's chief-justice, who was then out of the\r\nlimits of his jurisdiction, cause to be taken at Benares, before or by\r\nthe said Sir Elijah Impey, and through the intervention, not of the\r\nCompany's interpreter, but of a certain private interpreter of his, the\r\nsaid Hastings's, own appointment, and a dependant on him, called Major\r\nDavy, several declarations and depositions by natives of Hindostan,--and\r\ndid also cause to be taken before the said Sir Elijah Impey several\r\nattestations in English, made by British subjects, and which were\r\nafterwards transmitted to Calcutta, and laid before the\r\nCouncil-General,--some of which depositions were upon oath, some upon\r\nhonor, and others neither upon _oath_ nor _honor_, but all or most of\r\nwhich were of an irregular and irrelevant nature, and not fit or decent\r\nto be taken by a British magistrate, or to be transmitted to a British\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nXXIII. That one of the said attestations (but not on oath) was made by a\r\nprincipal minister of the Nabob of Oude, to whom the said Hastings had\r\nsome time before proposed to sell the sovereignty of that very territory\r\nof Benares; and that one other attestation (not upon oath) was made by a\r\nnative woman of distinction, whose son he, the said Hastings, did\r\nactually promote to the government of Benares, vacated by the unjust\r\nexpulsion of the Rajah aforesaid, and who in her deposition did declare\r\nthat she considered the expelled Rajah as her enemy, and that he never\r\ndid confer with her, or suffer her to be acquainted with any of his\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nXXIV. That, besides the depositions of persons interested in the ruin of\r\nthe Rajah, others were made by persons who then received pensions from\r\nhim, the said Hastings; and several of the affidavits were made by\r\npersons of mean condition, and so wholly illiterate as not to be able to\r\nwrite their names.\r\n\r\nXXV. That he, the said Hastings, did also cause to be examined by\r\nvarious proofs and essays, the result of which was delivered in upon\r\nhonor, the quality of certain military stores taken by the British\r\ntroops from the said Rajah of Benares; and upon the report that the same\r\nwere of a good quality, and executed by persons conversant in the making\r\nof good military stores, although the cannon was stated by the same\r\nauthority to be bad, he, the said Warren Hastings, from the report\r\naforesaid, did maliciously, and contrary to the principles of natural\r\nand legal reason, infer that the insurrection which had been raised by\r\nhis own violence and oppression, and rendered for a time successful by\r\nhis own improvidence, was the consequence of a premeditated design to\r\noverturn the British empire in India, and to exterminate therefrom the\r\nBritish nation; which design, if it had been true, the said Hastings\r\nmight have known, or rationally conjectured, and ought to have provided\r\nagainst. And if the said Hastings had received any credible information\r\nof such design, it was his duty to lay the same before the Council\r\nBoard, and to state the same to the Rajah, when he was in a condition to\r\nhave given an answer thereto or to observe thereon, and not, after he\r\nhad proscribed and driven him from his dominions, to have inquired into\r\noffences to justify the previous infliction of punishment.\r\n\r\nXXVI. That it does not appear, that, in taking the said depositions,\r\nthere was any person present on the part of the Rajah to object to the\r\ncompetence or credibility or relevancy of any of the said affidavits or\r\nother attestations, or to account, otherwise than as the said deponents\r\ndid account, for any of the facts therein stated; nor were any copies\r\nthereof sent to the said Rajah, although the Company had a minister at\r\nthe place of his residence, namely, in the camp of the Mahratta chief\r\nSindia, so as to enable him to transmit to the Company any matters which\r\nmight induce or enable them to do justice to the injured prince\r\naforesaid. And it does not appear that the said Hastings has ever\r\nproduced any witness, letter, or other document, tending to prove that\r\nthe said Rajah ever did carry on any hostile negotiation whatever with\r\nany of those powers with whom he was charged with a conspiracy against\r\nthe Company, previous to the period of the said Hastings's having\r\narrested him in his palace, although he, the said Hastings, had various\r\nagents at the courts of all those princes,--and that a late principal\r\nagent and near relation of a minister of one them, the Rajah of Berar,\r\ncalled Benaram Pundit, was, at the time of the tumult at Benares,\r\nactually with the said Hastings, and the said Benaram Pundit was by him\r\nhighly applauded for his zeal and fidelity, and was therefore by him\r\nrewarded with a large pension on those very revenues which he had taken\r\nfrom the Rajah Cheyt Sing, and if such a conspiracy had previously\r\nexisted, the Mahratta minister aforesaid must have known, and would have\r\nattested it.\r\n\r\nXXVII. That it appears that the said Warren Hastings, at the time that\r\nhe formed his design of seizing upon the treasures of the Rajah of\r\nBenares, and of deposing him, did not believe him guilty of that\r\npremeditated project for driving the English out of India with which he\r\nafterwards thought fit to charge him, or that he was really guilty of\r\nany other great offence: because he has caused it to be deposed, that,\r\nif the said Rajah should pay the sum of money by him exacted, \"he would\r\nsettle his zemindary upon him on the most eligible footing\"; whereas, if\r\nhe had conceived him to have entertained traitorous designs against the\r\nCompany, from whom he held his tributary estate, or had been otherwise\r\nguilty of such enormous offences as to make it necessary to take\r\nextraordinary methods for coercing him, it would not have been proper\r\nfor him to settle upon such a traitor and criminal the zemindary of\r\nBenares, or any other territory, upon the most eligible, or upon any\r\nother footing whatever: whereby the said Hastings has by his own stating\r\ndemonstrated that the money intended to have been exacted was not as a\r\npunishment for crimes, but that the crimes were pretended for the\r\npurpose of exacting money.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. That the said Warren Hastings, in order to justify the acts of\r\nviolence aforesaid to the Court of Directors, did assert certain false\r\nfacts, known by him to be such, and did draw from them certain false and\r\ndangerous inferences, utterly subversive of the rights of the princes\r\nand subjects dependent on the British nation in India, contrary to the\r\nprinciples of all just government, and highly dishonorable to that of\r\nGreat Britain: namely, that the \"Rajah of Benares was not a vassal or\r\ntributary prince, and that the deeds which passed between him and the\r\nboard, upon the transfer of the zemindary in 1775, were not to be\r\nunderstood to bear the quality and force of a treaty upon optional\r\nconditions between equal states; that the payments to be made by him\r\nwere not a tribute, but a rent; and that the instruments by which his\r\nterritories were conveyed to him did not differ from common grants to\r\nzemindars who were merely subjects; but that, being nothing more than a\r\ncommon zemindar and mere subject, and the Company holding the\r\nacknowledged rights of his former sovereign, held an absolute authority\r\nover him; that, in the known relations of zemindar to the sovereign\r\nauthority, or power delegated by it, he owed a personal allegiance and\r\nan implicit and unreserved obedience to that authority, at the\r\nforfeiture of his zemindary, and even of his life and property.\" Whereas\r\nthe said Hastings did well know, that, whether the payments from the\r\nRajah were called _rent_ or _tribute_, having been frequently by himself\r\ncalled the one and the other, and that of whatever nature the\r\ninstruments by which he held might have been, he did not consider him as\r\na common zemindar or landholder, but as far independent as a tributary\r\nprince could be: for he did assign as a reason for receiving his rent\r\nrather within the Company's province than in his own capital, that it\r\nwould not \"frustrate the intention of rendering the Rajah _independent_;\r\nthat, if a Resident was appointed to receive the money as it became due\r\nat Benares, such a Resident would unavoidably acquire an influence over\r\nthe Rajah, and over his country, which would in effect render him the\r\nmaster of both; that this consequence might not, perhaps, be brought\r\ncompletely to pass without a struggle, and many appeals to the Council,\r\nwhich, in a government constituted like this, cannot fail to terminate\r\nagainst the Rajah, and, by the construction to which his opposition to\r\nthe agent would be liable, might eventually draw on him severe\r\nrestrictions, and end _in reducing him to the mean and depraved state of\r\na zemindar_.\"\r\n\r\nXXIX. And the said Hastings, in the said Minute of Consultation, having\r\nenumerated the frauds, embezzlements, and oppressions which would ensue\r\nfrom the Rajah's being in the dependent state aforesaid, and having\r\nobviated all apprehensions from giving to him the implied symbols of\r\ndominion, did assert, \"that, without such appearance, he would expect\r\nfrom every change of government additional demands to be made upon him,\r\nand would of course descend to all the arts of intrigue and concealment\r\npractised by other dependent Rajahs, which would keep him indigent and\r\nweak, and eventually prove hurtful to the Company; but that, by proper\r\nencouragement and protection, he might prove a profitable dependant, an\r\nuseful barrier, and even a powerful ally to the Company; but that he\r\nwould be neither, if the conditions of his connection with the Company\r\nwere left open to future variations.\"\r\n\r\nXXX. That, if the fact had been true that the Rajah of Benares was\r\nmerely an eminent landholder or any other subject, the wicked and\r\ndangerous doctrine aforesaid, namely, that he owed a personal allegiance\r\nand an implicit and unreserved obedience to the sovereign authority, at\r\nthe forfeiture of his zemindary, and even of his life and property, at\r\nthe discretion of those who held or fully represented the sovereign\r\nauthority, doth leave security neither for life nor property to any\r\npersons residing under the Company's protection; and that no such\r\npowers, nor any powers of that nature, had been delegated to the said\r\nWarren Hastings by any provisions of the act of Parliament appointing a\r\nGovernor-General and Council at Fort William in Bengal.\r\n\r\nXXXI. That the said Warren Hastings did also advance another dangerous\r\nand pernicious principle in justification of his violent, arbitrary, and\r\niniquitous actings aforesaid: namely, \"that, if he had acted with an\r\nunwarrantable rigor, and even injustice, towards Cheyt Sing, yet, first,\r\nif he did _believe_ that extraordinary means were necessary, and those\r\nexerted with a strong hand, to preserve the Company's interests from\r\nsinking under the accumulated weight that oppressed them, or, secondly,\r\nif he saw a _political necessity_ for curbing the _overgrown_ power of a\r\ngreat member of their dominion, and to make it contribute to the relief\r\nof their pressing exigencies, that his error would be excusable, as\r\nprompted by an excess of zeal for their [the Company's] interest,\r\noperating with too strong a bias on his judgment; but that much stronger\r\nis the presumption, that such acts are founded on just principles than\r\nthat they are the result of a misguided judgment.\" That the said\r\ndoctrines are, in both the members thereof, subversive of all the\r\nprinciples of just government, by empowering a governor with delegated\r\nauthority, in the first case, on his own private _belief_ concerning the\r\nnecessities of the state, not to levy an impartial and equal rate of\r\ntaxation suitable to the circumstances of the several members of the\r\ncommunity, but to select any individual from the same as an object of\r\narbitrary and unmeasured imposition,--and, in the second case, enabling\r\nthe same governor, on the same arbitrary principles, to determine whose\r\nproperty should be considered as overgrown, and to reduce the same at\r\nhis pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nSECOND REVOLUTION IN BENARES.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, after he had, in the manner aforesaid,\r\nunjustly and violently expelled the Rajah Cheyt Sing, the lord or\r\nzemindar of Benares, from his said lordship or zemindary, did, of his\r\nown mere usurped authority, and without any communication with the other\r\nmembers of the Council of Calcutta, appoint another person, of the name\r\nof Mehip Narrain, a descendant by the mother from the late Rajah,\r\nBulwant Sing, to the government of Benares; and on account or pretence\r\nof his youth and inexperience (the said Mehip Narrain not being above\r\ntwenty years old) did appoint his father, Durbege Sing, to act as his\r\nrepresentative or administrator of his affairs; but did give a\r\ncontrolling authority to the British Resident over both, notwithstanding\r\nhis declarations before mentioned of the mischiefs likely to happen to\r\nthe said country from the establishment of a Resident, and his opinion\r\nsince declared in a letter to the Court of Directors, dated from this\r\nvery place (Benares) the 1st of October, 1784, to the same or stronger\r\neffect, in case \"agents are sent into the country, and armed with\r\nauthority for the purposes of vengeance and corruption,--_for to no\r\nother will they be applied_.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings did, by the same usurped authority,\r\nentirely set aside all the agreements made between the late Rajah and\r\nthe Company (which were real agreements with the state of Benares, in\r\nthe person of the lord or prince thereof, and his heirs); and without\r\nany form of trial, inquisition, or other legal process, for forfeiture\r\nof the privileges of the people to be governed by magistrates of their\r\nown, and according to their natural laws, customs, and usages, did,\r\ncontrary to the said agreement, separate the mint and the criminal\r\njustice from the said government, and did vest the mint in the British\r\nResident, and the criminal justice in a Mahomedan native of his own\r\nappointment; and did enhance the tribute to be paid from the province,\r\nfrom two hundred and fifty thousand pounds annually, limited by treaty,\r\nor thereabouts, to three hundred and thirty thousand pounds for the\r\nfirst year, and to four hundred thousand for every year after; and did\r\ncompel the administrator aforesaid (father to the Rajah) to agree to the\r\nsame; and did, by the same usurped authority, illegally impose, and\r\ncause to be levied, sundry injudicious and oppressive duties on goods\r\nand merchandise, which did greatly impair the trade of the province, and\r\nthreaten the utter ruin thereof; and did charge several pensions on the\r\nsaid revenues, of his own mere authority; and did send and keep up\r\nvarious bodies of the Company's troops in the said country; and did\r\nperform sundry other acts with regard to the said territory, in total\r\nsubversion of the rights of the sovereign and the people, and in\r\nviolation of the treaties and agreements aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, being absent, on account of ill health,\r\nfrom the Presidency of Calcutta, at a place called Nia Serai, about\r\nforty miles distant therefrom, did carry on a secret correspondence with\r\nthe Resident at Benares, and, under color that the instalments for the\r\nnew rent or tribute were in arrear, did of his own authority make, in\r\nabout one year, a second revolution in the government of the territory\r\naforesaid, and did order and direct that Durbege Sing aforesaid, father\r\nof the Rajah, and administrator of his authority, should be deprived of\r\nhis office and of his lands, and thrown into prison, and did threaten\r\nhim with death: although he, the said Warren Hastings, had, at the time\r\nof the making his new arrangement, declared himself sensible that the\r\nrent aforesaid might require abatement; although he was well apprised\r\nthat the administrator had been for two months of his administration in\r\na weak and languid state of body, and wholly incapable of attending to\r\nthe business of the collections; though a considerable drought had\r\nprevailed in the said province, and did consequently affect the\r\nregularity and produce of the collections; and though he had other\r\nsufficient reason to believe that the said administrator had not himself\r\nreceived from the collectors of government and the cultivators of the\r\nsoil the rent in arrear: yet he, the said Warren Hastings, without any\r\nknown process, or recording any answer, defence, plea, exculpation, or\r\napology from the party, or recording any other grounds of rigor against\r\nhim, except the following paragraph of a letter from the Resident, not\r\nonly gave the order as aforesaid, but did afterwards, without laying any\r\nother or better ground before the Council-General, persuade them to, and\r\ndid procure from them, a confirmation of the aforesaid cruel and\r\nillegal proceedings, the correspondence concerning which had not been\r\nbefore communicated: he pleading his illness for not communicating the\r\nsame, though that illness did not prevent him from carrying on\r\ncorrespondence concerning the deposition of the said administrator, and\r\nother important affairs in various places.\r\n\r\nThat in the letter to the Council requiring the confirmation of his acts\r\naforesaid the said Warren Hastings did not only propose the confinement\r\nof the said administrator at Benares, although by his imprisonment he\r\nmust have been in a great measure disabled from recovering the balances\r\ndue to him, and for the non-payment of which he was thus imprisoned, but\r\ndid propose, as an alternative, his imprisonment at a remote fortress,\r\nout of the said territory, and in the Company's provinces, called\r\nChunar: desiring them to direct the Resident at Benares \"to exact from\r\nBaboo Durbege Sing every rupee of the collections which it shall appear\r\nthat he has made and not brought to account, and either to confine him\r\nat Benares, or to send him a prisoner to Chunar, and to keep him in\r\nconfinement until he shall have discharged the whole of the amount due\r\nfrom him.\" And the said Warren Hastings did assign motives of passion\r\nand personal resentment for the said unjust and rigorous proceedings, as\r\nfollows: \"I feel myself, and may be allowed on such an occasion to\r\nacknowledge it, personally hurt at the ingratitude of this man, and at\r\nthe discredit which his ill conduct has thrown on my appointment of him.\r\nHe has deceived me; he has offended against the government which I then\r\nrepresented.\" And as a further reason for depriving him of his jaghire,\r\n(or salary out of land,) he did insinuate in the said letter, but\r\nwithout giving or offering any proof, \"that the said Rajah had been\r\nguilty of _little and mean peculations_, although the appointments\r\nassigned to him had been sufficient to free him from the temptations\r\nthereto.\"\r\n\r\nThat it appears, as it might naturally have been expected, that the wife\r\nof the said administrator, the daughter of Bulwant Sing, the late Rajah\r\nof Benares, and her son, the reigning Rajah, did oppose to the best of\r\ntheir power, but by what remonstrances or upon what plea the said Warren\r\nHastings did never inform the Court of Directors, the deposition,\r\nimprisonment, and confiscation of the estates of the husband of the one\r\nand the father of the other; but that the said Hastings, persisting in\r\nhis malice, did declare to the said Council as follows: \"The opposition\r\nmade by the Rajah and the old Rannee, both equally incapable of judging\r\nfor _themselves_, does certainly originate from some secret influence,\r\nwhich ought to be checked by a decided and peremptory declaration of the\r\nauthority of the board, and a denunciation of their displeasure at\r\n_their presumption_.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, not satisfied with the injuries done and\r\nthe insults and disgraces offered to the family aforesaid, did, in a\r\nmanner unparalleled, except by an act of his own on another occasion,\r\nfraudulently and inhumanly endeavor to make the wife and son of the said\r\nadministrator, contrary to the sentiments and the law of Nature, the\r\ninstruments of his oppressions: directing, \"that, if they\" (the mother\r\nand son aforesaid) \"could be _induced_ to yield _the appearance of a\r\ncheerful acquiescence_ in the new arrangement, and to adopt it as _a\r\nmeasure formed with their participation_, it would be better than that\r\nit should be done by a declared act of compulsion; but that at all\r\nevents it ought to be done.\"\r\n\r\nThat, in consequence of the pressing declarations aforesaid, the said\r\nWarren Hastings did on his special recommendation appoint, in opposition\r\nto the wishes and desires of the Rajah and his mother, another person to\r\nthe administration of his affairs, called Jagher Deo Seo.\r\n\r\nThat, the Company having sent express orders for the sending the\r\nResident by them before appointed to Benares, the said Warren Hastings\r\ndid strongly oppose himself to the same, and did throw upon the person\r\nappointed by the Company (Francis Fowke, Esquire) several strong, but\r\nunspecified, reflections and aspersions, contrary to the duty he owed to\r\nthe Company, and to the justice he owed to all its servants.\r\n\r\nThat the said Resident, being appointed by the votes of the rest of the\r\nCouncil, in obedience to the reiterated orders of the Company, and in\r\ndespite of the opposition of the said Hastings, did proceed to Benares,\r\nand, on the representation of the parties, and the submission of the\r\naccounts of the aforesaid Durbege Sing to an arbitrator, did find him,\r\nthe said Durbege Sing, in debt to the Company for a sum not considerable\r\nenough to justify the severe treatment of the said Durbege Sing: his\r\nwife and son complaining, at or about the same time, that the balances\r\ndue to him from the _aumils_, or sub-collectors, had been received by\r\nthe new administrator, and carried to his own credit, in prejudice and\r\nwrong to the said Durbege Sing; which representation, the only one that\r\nhas been transmitted on the part of the said sufferers, has not been\r\ncontradicted.\r\n\r\nThat it appears that the said Durbege Sing did afterwards go to Calcutta\r\nfor the redress of his grievances, and that it does not appear that the\r\nsame were redressed, or even his complaints heard, but he received two\r\nperemptory orders from the Supreme Council to leave the said city and to\r\nreturn to Benares; that, on his return to Benares, and being there met\r\nby Warren Hastings aforesaid, he, the said Warren Hastings, although he\r\nhad reason to be well assured that the said Durbege Sing was in\r\npossession of small or no substance, did again cruelly and inhumanly,\r\nand without any legal authority, order the said Durbege Sing to be\r\nstrictly imprisoned; and the said Durbege Sing, in consequence of the\r\nvexations, hardships, and oppressions aforesaid, died in a short time\r\nafter, insolvent, but whether in prison or not does not appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nTHIRD REVOLUTION IN BENARES.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, having, in the manner before recited,\r\ndivested Durbege Sing of the administration of the province of Benares,\r\ndid, of his own arbitrary will and pleasure, and against the\r\nremonstrances of the Rajah and his mother, (in whose name and in whose\r\nright the said Durbege Sing, father of the one, and husband of the\r\nother, had administered the affairs of the government,) appoint a person\r\ncalled Jagher Deo Seo to administer the same.\r\n\r\nThat the new administrator, warned by the severe example made of his\r\npredecessor, is represented by the said Warren Hastings as having made\r\nit his \"avowed principle\" (as it might be expected it should be) \"that\r\nthe sum fixed for the revenue _must_ be collected.\" And he did, upon the\r\nprinciple aforesaid, and by the means suggested by a principle of that\r\nsort, accordingly levy from the country, and did regularly discharge to\r\nthe British Resident at Benares, by monthly payments, the sums imposed\r\nby the said Warren Hastings, as it is asserted by the Resident, Fowke;\r\nbut the said Warren Hastings did assert that his annual collections did\r\nnot amount to more than Lac 37,37,600, or thereabouts, which he says is\r\nmuch short of the revenues of the province, and is by about twenty-four\r\nthousand pounds short of his agreement.\r\n\r\nThat it further appears, that, notwithstanding the new administrator\r\naforesaid was appointed two months, or thereabouts, after the beginning\r\nof the Fusseli year, that is to say, about the middle of November, 1782,\r\nand the former administrator had collected a certain portion of the\r\nrevenues of that year, amounting to 17,000_l._ and upwards, yet he, the\r\nsaid new administrator, upon the unjust and destructive principle\r\naforesaid, suggested by the cruel and violent proceedings of the said\r\nWarren Hastings towards his predecessor, did levy on the province,\r\nwithin the said year, the whole amount of the revenues to be collected,\r\nin addition to the sum collected by his predecessor aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThat, on account of a great drought which prevailed in the province\r\naforesaid, a remission of certain duties in grain was proposed by the\r\nchief criminal judge at Benares; but the administrator aforesaid, being\r\nfearful that the revenue should fall short in his hands, did strenuously\r\noppose himself to the necessary relief to the inhabitants of the said\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThat, notwithstanding the cantonment of several bodies of the Company's\r\ntroops within the province, since the abolition of the native\r\ngovernment, it became subject in a particular manner to the depredations\r\nof the Rajahs upon the borders; insomuch that in one quarter no fewer\r\nthan thirty villages had been sacked and burned, and the inhabitants\r\nreduced to the most extreme distress.\r\n\r\nThat the Resident, in his letter to the board at Calcutta, did represent\r\nthat the collection of the revenue was become very difficult, and,\r\nbesides the extreme drought, did assign for a cause of that difficulty\r\nthe following. \"That there is also one fund which in former years was\r\noften applied in this country to remedy temporary inconveniences in the\r\nrevenue, and which in the present year does not exist. This was the\r\nprivate fortunes of merchants and _shroffs_ [bankers] resident in\r\nBenares, from whom _aumils_ [collectors] of credit could obtain\r\ntemporary loans to satisfy the immediate calls of the Rajah. These sums,\r\nwhich used to circulate between the aumil and the merchant, have been\r\nturned into a different channel, by bills of exchange to defray the\r\nexpenses of government, both on the west coast of India, and also at\r\nMadras.\" To which representation it does not appear that any answer was\r\ngiven, or that any mode of redress was adopted in consequence thereof.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, having passed through the province of\r\nBenares (Gazipore) in his progress towards Oude, did, in a letter dated\r\nfrom the city of Lucknow, the 2d of April, 1784, give to the Council\r\nBoard at Calcutta an account, highly dishonorable to the British\r\ngovernment, of the effect of the arrangements made by himself in the\r\nyears 1781 and 1782, in the words following. \"Having contrived, by\r\nmaking forced stages, while the troops of my escort marched at the\r\nordinary rate, to make a stay of five days at Benares, I was thereby\r\nfurnished with the means of acquiring some knowledge of the state of the\r\nprovince, which I am anxious to communicate to you. Indeed, the inquiry,\r\nwhich was _in a great degree obtruded upon me_, affected me with very\r\nmortifying reflections on my inability to apply it to any useful\r\npurpose. From the confines of Buxar to Benares I was followed and\r\n_fatigued_ by the clamors of the discontented inhabitants. It was what I\r\nexpected in a degree, because it is rare that the exercise of authority\r\nshould prove satisfactory to all who are the objects of it. The\r\ndistresses which were produced by the long-continued drought unavoidably\r\ntended to heighten the general discontent; _yet I have reason to fear\r\nthat the cause existed principally in a defective, if not a corrupt and\r\noppressive administration_. Of a multitude of petitions which were\r\npresented to me, and of which I took minutes, every one that did not\r\nrelate to a personal grievance contained the representation of one and\r\nthe same species of oppression, which is in its nature of an influence\r\nmost fatal to the future cultivation. The practice to which I allude is\r\nthis. It is affirmed that the aumils and renters exact from the\r\nproprietors of the actual harvest a large increase in kind on their\r\nstipulated rent: that is, from those who hold their _pottah_ by the\r\ntenure of paying _one half_ of the produce of their crops, either _the\r\nwhole_ without subterfuge, or a _large_ proportion of it by a _false\r\nmeasurement_ or other pretexts; and from those whose engagements are for\r\na fixed rent _in money_, the half, or a greater proportion, is taken _in\r\nkind_. This is in effect a tax upon the industry of the inhabitants:\r\nsince there is scarce a field of grain in the province, _I might say not\r\none_, which has not been preserved by the incessant labor of the\r\ncultivator, by digging wells for their supply, or watering them from the\r\nwells of masonry with which their country abounds, or from the\r\nneighboring tanks, rivers, and nullahs. The people who imposed on\r\nthemselves this voluntary and extraordinary labor, and not unattended\r\nwith expense, did it on the expectation of reaping the profits of it;\r\nand it is certain they would not have done it, if they had known that\r\ntheir rulers, _from whom they were entitled to an indemnification_,\r\nwould take from them what they had so hardly earned. If the same\r\nadministration continues, and the country shall again labor under a want\r\nof rain, _every field will be abandoned, the revenue fail, and thousands\r\nperish through want of subsistence_: for who will labor for the _sole_\r\nbenefit of others, and to make himself the subject of exaction? These\r\npractices are to be imputed to the Naib himself\" (the administrator\r\nforced by the said Warren Hastings on the present Rajah of Benares).\r\n\"The avowed principle on which he acts, and which he acknowledged to\r\nmyself, is, that the _whole_ sum fixed for the revenue of the province\r\n_must_ be collected,--and that, for this purpose, the deficiency arising\r\nin places where the crops have failed, or which have been left\r\nuncultivated, must be supplied from the resources of others, where the\r\nsoil has been better suited to the season, or the industry of the\r\ncultivators hath been more successfully exerted: a principle which,\r\nhowever specious and plausible it may at first appear, _certainly tends\r\nto the most pernicious and destructive consequences_. If this\r\ndeclaration of the Naib had been made only to myself, I might have\r\ndoubted my construction of it; but it was repeated by him to Mr.\r\nAnderson, who understood it exactly in the same sense. In the management\r\nof the customs, the conduct of the Naib, or of the officer under him,\r\nwas forced also upon my attention. _The exorbitant rates exacted by an\r\narbitrary valuation of the goods_, the practice of exacting duties\r\n_twice_ on the same goods, (first from the seller, and afterwards from\r\nthe buyer,) and the vexations, disputes, and delays drawn on the\r\nmerchants by these oppressions, were loudly complained of; and some\r\ninstances of this kind were said to exist at the very time I was at\r\nBenares. Under such circumstances, we are not to wonder, if the\r\nmerchants of foreign countries are discouraged from resorting to\r\nBenares, and if the commerce of that province should annually decay.\r\n_Other_ evils, or imputed evils, have accidentally come to my knowledge,\r\nwhich I will not now particularize, as I hope, that, with the\r\nassistance of the Resident, they may be _in part_ corrected. One evil I\r\nmust mention, because it has been verified by my own observation, and is\r\nof that kind which reflects an unmerited reproach on our general and\r\nnational character. When I was at Buxar, the Resident, at my desire,\r\nenjoined the Naib to appoint creditable people to every town through\r\nwhich our route lay, to persuade and encourage the inhabitants to remain\r\nin their houses, promising to give them guards as I approached, and they\r\nrequired it for their protection; and that he might perceive how earnest\r\nI was for his observation of this precaution, I repeated it to him in\r\nperson, and dismissed him that he might precede me for that purpose.\r\nBut, to my great disappointment, _I found every place through which I\r\npassed abandoned; nor had there been a man left in any of them for their\r\nprotection_. I am sorry to add, _that, from Buxar to the opposite\r\nboundary, I have seen nothing but traces of complete devastation in\r\nevery village: whether caused by the followers of the troops which have\r\nlately passed, for their natural relief, (and I know not whether my own\r\nmay not have had their share,)_ or from the apprehensions of the\r\ninhabitants left to themselves, and of themselves deserting their\r\nhouses. I wish to acquit my own countrymen of the blame of these\r\nunfavorable appearances, and in my own heart I do acquit them; for at\r\none encampment a crowd of people came to me complaining that _their new\r\naumil (collector), on the approach of any military detachment, himself\r\nfirst fled from the place; and the inhabitants, having no one to whom\r\nthey could apply for redress, or for the representation of their\r\ngrievances, and being thus remediless, fled also; so that their houses\r\nand effects became a prey to any person who chose to plunder them_. The\r\ngeneral conclusion appeared to me an inevitable consequence from such a\r\nstate of facts; and my own senses bore testimony to it in this specific\r\ninstance: nor do I know how it is possible for any officer commanding a\r\nmilitary party, how attentive soever he may be to the discipline and\r\nforbearance of his people, to prevent disorders, _when there is neither\r\nopposition to hinder nor evidence to detect them_. These and many other\r\nirregularities I impute _solely_ to the Naib, and recommend his instant\r\nremoval. I cannot help remarking, that, except the city of Benares, _the\r\nprovince is in effect without a government. The administration of the\r\nprovince is misconducted, and the people oppressed, trade discouraged,\r\nand the revenue in danger of a rapid decline, from the violent\r\nappropriation of its means._\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings did recommend to the Council, for a remedy\r\nof the disorders and calamities which had arisen from his own acts,\r\ndispositions, and appointments, that the administrator aforesaid should\r\nbe instantly removed from his office,--attributing the aforesaid\r\n\"irregularities, _and many others, solely_ to him,\" although, on his own\r\nrepresentation, it does appear that he was the sole cause of the\r\nirregularities therein described. Neither does it appear that the\r\nadministrator, so by the said Hastings nominated and removed, was\r\nproperly charged and called to answer for the said recited\r\nirregularities, or for the _many others_ not recited, but _attributed\r\nsolely_ to him; nor has any plea or excuse from him been transmitted to\r\nthe board, or to the Court of Directors; but he was, at the instance of\r\nthe said Hastings, deprived of his said office, contrary to the\r\nprinciples of natural justice, in a violent and arbitrary manner; which\r\nproceeding, combined with the example made of his predecessor, must\r\nnecessarily leave to the person who should succeed to the said office no\r\ndistinct principle upon which he might act with safety. But in comparing\r\nthe consequences of the two delinquencies charged, the failure of the\r\npayment of the revenues (from whatever cause it may arise) is more\r\nlikely to be avoided than any severe course towards the inhabitants: as\r\nthe former fault was, besides the deprivation of office, attended with\r\ntwo imprisonments, with a menace of death, and an actual death, in\r\ndisgrace, poverty, and insolvency; whereas the latter, namely, the\r\noppression, and thereby the total ruin, of the country, charged on the\r\nsecond administrator, was only followed by loss of office,--although,\r\nhe, the said Warren Hastings, did farther assert (but with what truth\r\ndoes not appear) that the collection of the last administrator had\r\nfallen much short of the revenue of the province.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings himself was sensible that the frequent\r\nchanges by him made would much disorder the management of the revenues,\r\nand seemed desirous of concealing his intentions concerning the last\r\nchange until the time of its execution. Yet it appears, by a letter from\r\nthe British Resident, dated the 23d of June, 1784, \"that a very strong\r\nreport prevailed at Benares of his [the said Hastings's] intentions of\r\nappointing a new Naib for the approaching year, and that the effect is\r\nevident which the prevalence of such an idea amongst the aumils would\r\nprobably have on the cultivation at this particular time. The heavy\r\nmofussil kists [harvest instalments] have now been collected by the\r\naumils; the season of tillage is arrived; the ryots [country farmers]\r\nmust be indulged, and even assisted by advances; and the aumil must look\r\nfor his returns in the abundance of the crop, _the consequence of this\r\nearly attention to the cultivation_. The effect is evident _which the\r\nreport of a change in the first officer of the revenue must have on the\r\nminds of the aumils, by leaving them at an uncertainty of what they have\r\nin future to expect_; and in proportion to the degree of this\r\nuncertainty, their efforts and expenses in promoting the cultivation\r\nwill be languid and sparing. In compliance with the Naib's request, I\r\nhave written to all the aumils, encouraging and ordering them to attend\r\nto the cultivation of their respective districts; but I conceive I\r\nshould be able to promote this very desirable intention much more\r\neffectually, if you will honor me with the communication of your\r\nintentions on this subject. At the same time I cannot help just\r\nremarking, that, if a change is intended, the sooner it takes place, the\r\nmore _the bad effects_ I have described will be obviated.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Council, having received the proposition for the removal of the\r\nadministrator aforesaid, did also, in a letter to him, the said\r\nHastings, condemn the frequent changes by him made in the administration\r\nof the collections of Benares,--but did consent to such alterations as\r\nmight be made without encroaching on the rights established by his, the\r\nsaid Hastings's, agreement in the year 1781, and did desire him to\r\ntransmit to them his plan for a new administration.\r\n\r\nThat the said Hastings did transmit a plan, which, notwithstanding the\r\nevils which had happened from the former frequent changes, he did\r\npropose _as a temporary expedient_ for the administration of the\r\nrevenues of the said province,--in which no provision was made for the\r\nreduction or remission of revenue as exigences might require, or for the\r\nextraction of the circulating specie from the said province, or for the\r\nsupply of the necessary advances for cultivation, nor for the removal or\r\nprevention of any of the grievances by him before complained of, other\r\nthan an inspection by the Resident and the chief criminal magistrate of\r\nBenares, and other regulations equally void of effect and\r\nauthority,--and which plan Mr. Stables, one of the Supreme Council, did\r\naltogether reject; but the same was approved of _as a temporary\r\nexpedient_, with some exceptions, by two other members of the board, Mr.\r\nWheler and Mr. Macpherson, declaring _the said Warren Hastings\r\nresponsible for the temporary expediency of the same_.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, in the plan aforesaid, having strongly\r\nobjected to the appointment of any European collectors, that is to say,\r\nof any European servants of the Company being concerned in the same,\r\ndeclaring that there had been sufficient experience of the ill effects\r\nof their being so employed in the province of Bengal,--by which the said\r\nHastings did either in loose and general terms convey a false imputation\r\nupon the conduct of the Company's servants employed in the collection of\r\nthe revenues of Bengal, or he was guilty of a criminal neglect of duty\r\nin not bringing to punishment the particular persons whose evil\r\npractices had given rise to such a general imputation on British\r\nsubjects and servants of the Company as to render them unfit for service\r\nin other places.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, having in the course of three years made\r\nthree complete revolutions in the state of Benares, by expelling, in the\r\nfirst instance, the lawful and rightful governor of the same, under\r\nwhose care and superintendence a large and certain revenue, suitable to\r\nthe abilities of the country, and consistent with its prosperity, was\r\npaid with the greatest punctuality, and by afterwards displacing two\r\neffective governors or administrators of the province, appointed in\r\nsuccession by himself, and, in consequence of the said appointments and\r\nviolent and arbitrary removals, the said province \"being left in effect\r\nwithout a government,\" except in one city only, and having, after all,\r\nsettled no more than a temporary arrangement, is guilty of an high crime\r\nand misdemeanor in the destruction of the country aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--PRINCESSES OF OUDE.\r\n\r\nI. That the reigning Nabob of Oude, commonly called Asoph ul Dowlah,\r\n(son and successor to Sujah ul Dowlah,) by taking into or continuing in\r\nhis pay certain bodies of regular British troops, and by having\r\nafterwards admitted the British Resident at his court into the\r\nmanagement of all his affairs, foreign and domestic, and particularly\r\ninto the administration of his finances, did gradually become in\r\nsubstance and effect, as well as in general repute and estimation, a\r\ndependant on, or vassal of, the East India Company, and was, and is, so\r\nmuch under the control of the Governor-General and Council of Bengal,\r\nthat, in the opinion of all the native powers, the English name and\r\ncharacter is concerned in every act of his government.\r\n\r\nII. That Warren Hastings, Esquire, contrary to law and to his duty, and\r\nin disobedience to the orders of the East India Company, arrogating to\r\nhimself the nomination of the Resident at the court of Oude, as his\r\nparticular agent and representative, and rejecting the Resident\r\nappointed by the Company, and obtruding upon them a person of his own\r\nchoice, did from that time render himself in a particular manner\r\nresponsible for the good government of the provinces composing the\r\ndominions of the Nabob of Oude.\r\n\r\nIII. That the provinces aforesaid, having been at the time of their\r\nfirst connection with the Company in an improved and flourishing\r\ncondition, and yielding a revenue of more than three millions of pounds\r\nsterling, or thereabouts, did soon after that period begin sensibly to\r\ndecline, and the subsidy of the British troops stationed in that\r\nprovince, as well as other sums of money due to the Company by treaty,\r\nran considerably in arrear; although the prince of the country, during\r\nthe time these arrears accrued, was otherwise in distress, and had been\r\nobliged to reduce all his establishments.\r\n\r\nIV. That the prince aforesaid, or Nabob of Oude, did, in humble and\r\nsubmissive terms, supplicate the said Warren Hastings to be relieved\r\nfrom a body of troops whose licentious behavior he complained of, and\r\nwho were stationed in his country without any obligation by treaty to\r\nmaintain them,--pleading the failure of harvest and the prevalence of\r\nfamine in his country: a compliance with which request by the said\r\nWarren Hastings was refused in unbecoming, offensive, and insulting\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nV. That the said Nabob, laboring under the aforesaid and other burdens,\r\nand being continually urged for payment, was advised to extort, and did\r\nextort, from his mother and grandmother, under the pretext of loans,\r\n(and sometimes without that appearance,) various great sums of money,\r\namounting in the whole to six hundred and thirty thousand pounds\r\nsterling, or thereabouts: alleging in excuse the rigorous demands of the\r\nEast India Company, for whose use the said extorted money had been\r\ndemanded, and to which a considerable part of it had been applied.\r\n\r\nVI. That the two female parents of the Nabob aforesaid were among the\r\nwomen of the greatest rank, family, and distinction in Asia, and were\r\nleft by the deceased Nabob, the son of the one and the husband of the\r\nother, in charge of certain considerable part of his treasures, in money\r\nand other valuable movables, as well as certain landed estates, called\r\njaghires, in order to the support of their own dignity, and the\r\nhonorable maintenance of his women, and a numerous offspring, and their\r\ndependants: the said family amounting in the whole to two thousand\r\npersons, who were by the said Nabob, at his death, recommended in a\r\nparticular manner to the care and protection of the said Warren\r\nHastings.\r\n\r\nVII. That, on the demand of the Nabob of Oude on his parents for the\r\nlast of the sums which completed the six hundred and thirty thousand\r\npounds aforesaid, they, the said parents, did positively refuse to pay\r\nany part of the same to their son for the use of the Company, until he\r\nshould agree to certain terms to be stipulated in a regular treaty, and\r\namong other particulars to secure them in the remainder of their\r\npossessions, and also on no account or pretence to make any further\r\ndemands or claims on them; and well knowing from whence all his claims\r\nand exactions had arisen, they demanded that the said treaty, or family\r\ncompact, should be guarantied by the Governor-General and Council of\r\nBengal: and a treaty was accordingly agreed to, executed by the Nabob,\r\nand guarantied by John Bristow, Esquire, the Resident at Oude, under the\r\nauthority and with the express consent of the said Warren Hastings and\r\nthe Council-General, and in consequence thereof the sum last required\r\nwas paid, and discharges given to the Nabob for all the money which he\r\nhad borrowed from his own mother and the mother of his father.\r\n\r\nThat, the distresses and disorders in the Nabob's government and his\r\ndebt to the Company continuing to increase, notwithstanding the violent\r\nmethods before mentioned taken to augment his resources, the said Warren\r\nHastings, on the 21st of May, and on the 31st July, 1781, (he and Mr.\r\nWheler being the only remaining members of the Council-General, and he\r\nhaving the conclusive and casting voice, and thereby being in effect the\r\nwhole Council,) did, in the name and under the authority of the board,\r\nresolve on a journey to the upper provinces, in order to a personal\r\ninterview with the Nabob of Oude, towards the settlement of his\r\ndistressed affairs, and did give to himself a delegation of the powers\r\nof the said Council, in direct violation of the Company's orders\r\nforbidding such delegation.\r\n\r\nVIII. That the said Warren Hastings having by his appointment met the\r\nNabob of Oude near a place called Chunar, and possessing an entire and\r\nabsolute command over the said prince, he did, contrary to justice and\r\nequity and the security of property, as well as to public faith and the\r\nsanction of the Company's guaranty, under the color of a treaty, which\r\ntreaty was conducted secretly, without a written document of any part of\r\nthe proceeding except the pretended treaty itself, authorize the said\r\nNabob to seize upon, and confiscate to his own profit, the landed\r\nestates, called jaghires, of his parents, kindred, and principal\r\nnobility: only stipulating a pension to the net amount of the rent of\r\nthe said lands as an equivalent, and that equivalent to such only whose\r\nlands had been guarantied to them by the Company; but provided neither\r\nin the said pretended treaty nor in any subsequent act the least\r\nsecurity for the payment of the said pension to those for whom such\r\npension was ostensibly reserved, and for the others not so much as a\r\nshow of indemnity;--to the extreme scandal of the British government,\r\nwhich, valuing itself upon a strict regard to property, did expressly\r\nauthorize, if it did not command, an attack upon that right,\r\nunprecedented in the despotic governments of India.\r\n\r\nIX. That the said Warren Hastings, in order to cover the violent and\r\nunjust proceedings aforesaid, did assert a claim of right in the same\r\nNabob to all the possessions of his said mother and grandmother, as\r\nbelonging to him by the Mahomedan law; and this pretended claim was set\r\nup by the said Warren Hastings, after the Nabob had, by a regular treaty\r\nratified and guarantied by the said Hastings as Governor-General,\r\nrenounced and released all demands on them. And this false pretence of a\r\nlegal demand was taken up and acted upon by the said Warren Hastings,\r\nwithout laying the said question on record before the Council-General,\r\nor giving notice to the persons to be affected thereby to support their\r\nrights before any of the principal magistrates and expounders of the\r\nMahomedan law, or taking publicly the opinions of any person conversant\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nX. That, in order to give further color to the acts of ill faith and\r\nviolence aforesaid, the said Warren Hastings did cause to be taken at\r\nLucknow and other places, before divers persons, and particularly before\r\nSir Elijah Impey, Knight, his Majesty's chief-justice, acting\r\nextra-judicially, and not within the limits of his jurisdiction, several\r\npassionate, careless, irrelevant, and irregular affidavits, consisting\r\nof matter not fit to be deposed on oath,--of reports, conjectures, and\r\nhearsays; some of the persons swearing to the said hearsays having\r\ndeclined to declare from whom they heard the accounts at second hand\r\nsworn to; the said affidavits in general tending to support the\r\ncalumnious charge of the said Warren Hastings, namely, that the aged\r\nwomen before mentioned had formed or engaged in a plan for the\r\ndeposition of their son and sovereign, and the _utter extirpation_ of\r\nthe English nation: and neither the said charge against persons whose\r\ndependence was principally, if not wholly, on the good faith of this\r\nnation, and highly affecting the honor, property, and even lives, of\r\nwomen of the highest condition, nor the affidavits intended to support\r\nthe same, extra-judicially taken, _ex parte_, and without notice, by the\r\nsaid Sir Elijah Impey and others, were at any time communicated to the\r\nparties charged, or to any agent for them; nor were they called upon to\r\nanswer, nor any explanation demanded of them.\r\n\r\nXI. That the article affecting private property secured by public acts,\r\nin the said pretended treaty, contains nothing more than a general\r\npermission, given by the said Warren Hastings, for confiscating such\r\njaghires, or landed estates, with the modifications therein contained,\r\n\"as _he_ [the Nabob] may find necessary,\" but does not directly point\r\nat, or express by name, any of the landed possessions of the Nabob's\r\nmother. But soon after the signing of the said pretended treaty, (that\r\nis, on the 29th November, 1781,) it did appear that a principal object\r\nthereof was to enable the Nabob to seize upon the estates of his female\r\nparents aforesaid, which had been guarantied to them by the East India\r\nCompany. And although in the treaty, or pretended treaty, aforesaid,\r\nnothing more is purported than to give a simple permission to the Nabob\r\nto seize upon and confiscate the estates, leaving the execution or\r\nnon-execution of the same wholly to his discretion, yet it appears, by\r\nseveral letters from Nathaniel Middleton, Esquire, the Resident at the\r\nCourt of Oude, of the 6th, 7th, and 9th of December, 1781, that no such\r\ndiscretion as expressed in the treaty was left, or intended to be left,\r\nwith him, the said Nabob, but that the said article ought practically to\r\nhave a construction of a directly contrary tendency: that, instead of\r\nconsidering the article as originating from the Nabob, and containing a\r\npower provided in his favor which he did not possess before, the\r\nconfiscation of the jaghires aforesaid was to be considered as a measure\r\noriginating from the English, and to be intended for their benefit, and,\r\nas such, that the execution was to be forced upon him; and the execution\r\nthereof was accordingly forced upon him. And the Resident, Middleton, on\r\nthe Nabob's refusal to act in contradiction to his sworn engagement\r\nguarantied by the East India Company, and in the undutiful and unnatural\r\nmanner required, did totally supersede his authority in his own\r\ndominions, considering himself as empowered so to act by the\r\ninstructions of the said Hastings, although he had reason to apprehend a\r\ngeneral insurrection in consequence thereof, and that he found it\r\nnecessary to remove his family, \"which he did not wish to retain there,\r\nin case of a rupture with the Nabob, or the necessity of employing the\r\nBritish forces in the reduction of _his_ aumils and troops\"; and he did\r\naccordingly, as sovereign, issue his own edicts and warrants, in\r\ndefiance of the resistance of the Nabob, in the manner by him described\r\nin the letters aforesaid,--in a letter of 6th December, 1781, that is to\r\nsay: \"_Finding the Nabob wavering in his determination about the\r\nresumption of the jaghires_, I this day, in presence of and with the\r\nminister's concurrence, ordered the necessary purwannahs to be written\r\nto the several aumils for that purpose; and it was my firm resolution to\r\nhave dispatched them this evening, with proper people to see them\r\npunctually and implicitly carried into execution; but before they were\r\nall transcribed, I received a message from the Nabob, who had been\r\ninformed by the minister of the resolution I had taken, entreating that\r\nI would withhold the purwannahs until to-morrow morning, when he would\r\nattend me, and afford me satisfaction on this point. As the loss of a\r\nfew hours in the dispatch of the purwannahs appeared of little moment,\r\nand as it is possible the Nabob, _seeing that the business will at all\r\nevents be done, may make it an act of his own, I have consented to\r\nindulge him in his request; but, be the remit of our interview whatever\r\nit may, nothing shall prevent the orders being issued to-morrow, either\r\nby him or myself, with the concurrence of the ministers_. Your pleasure\r\nrespecting the Begums I have learnt from Sir Elijah, and the measure\r\nheretofore proposed will soon follow the resumption of the jaghires.\r\nFrom both, or indeed from the former alone, I have no doubt of the\r\ncomplete liquidation of the Company's balance.\" And also in another\r\nletter, of the 7th December, 1781: \"I had the honor to address you\r\nyesterday, informing you of the steps I had taken in regard to the\r\nresumption of _the jaghires. This morning the Vizier came to me\r\naccording to his agreement, but seemingly without any intention or\r\ndesire to yield me satisfaction on the subject under discussion; for,\r\nafter a great deal of conversation, consisting on his part of trifling\r\nevasion and puerile excuses for withholding his assent to the measure,\r\nthough at the same time professing the most implicit submission to your\r\nwishes, I found myself without any other resource than the one of\r\nemploying that exclusive authority with which I consider your\r\ninstructions to vest me: I therefore declared to the Nabob, in presence\r\nof the minister and Mr. Johnson, who I desired might bear witness of the\r\nconversation, that I construed his rejection of the measure proposed as\r\na breach of his solemn promise to you, and an unwillingness to yield\r\nthat assistance which was evidently in his power towards liquidating his\r\nheavy accumulating debt to the Company_, and that I must in consequence\r\ndetermine, in my own justification, _to issue immediately the\r\npurwannahs_, which had only been withheld in the sanguine hope that he\r\nwould be prevailed upon _to make that his own act_ which nothing but the\r\nmost urgent necessity could force _me to make mine_. He left me without\r\nany reply, but afterwards sent for his minister and authorized him to\r\ngive me hopes that my requisition would be complied with; on which I\r\nexpressed my satisfaction, but declared that I could admit of no further\r\ndelays, and, unless I received his Excellency's formal acquiescence\r\nbefore the evening, I should then most assuredly issue _my_ purwannahs;\r\nwhich _I have accordingly done_, not having had any assurances from his\r\nExcellency that could justify a further suspension. I shall, as soon as\r\npossible, inform you of the effect of the purwannahs, which, in many\r\nparts, I am apprehensive it will be found necessary _to enforce with\r\nmilitary aid_. I am not, however, entirely without hopes that the Nabob,\r\n_when he sees the inefficacy of further opposition_, may alter his\r\nconduct, and prevent _the confusion and disagreeable consequences which\r\nwould be too likely to result from the prosecution of a measure of such\r\nimportance without his concurrence_. His Excellency talks of going to\r\nFyzabad, for the purpose heretofore mentioned, in three or four days: _I\r\nwish he may be serious in his intention_, and you may rest assured _I\r\nshall spare no pains to keep him to it_.\" And further, in a letter of\r\nthe 9th December, 1781: \"I had the honor to address you on the 7th\r\ninstant, informing you of the conversation which had passed between the\r\nNabob and me on the subject of resuming the jaghires, and the step I had\r\ntaken in consequence. _His Excellency appeared to be very much hurt and\r\nincensed at the measure, and loudly complains of the treachery of his\r\nministers,--first, in giving you any hopes that such a measure would be\r\nadopted, and, secondly, in their promising me their whole support in\r\ncarrying it through; but, as I apprehended, rather than suffer it to\r\nappear that the point had been carried in opposition to his will_, he at\r\nlength yielded a _nominal_ acquiescence, and has this day issued his own\r\npurwannahs to that effect,--_declaring, however, at the same time, both\r\nto me and his ministers, that it is an act of compulsion_. I hope to be\r\nable in a few days, in consequence of this measure, to transmit you an\r\naccount of the actual value and produce of the jaghires, opposed to the\r\nnominal amount at which they stand rated on the books of the circar.\"\r\n\r\nXII. That the said Warren Hastings, instead of expressing any\r\ndisapprobation of the proceedings aforesaid, in violation of the rights\r\nsecured by treaty with the mother and grandmother of the reigning prince\r\nof Oude, and not less in violation of the sovereign rights of the Nabob\r\nhimself, did by frequent messages stimulate the said Middleton to a\r\nperseverance in and to a rigorous execution of the same,--and in his\r\nletter from Benares of the 25th December, 1781, did \"express doubts of\r\nhis firmness and activity, and, above all, of his recollection of his\r\ninstructions and their importance; and that, if he could not rely on his\r\nown [power] and the means he possessed for performing those services, he\r\n_would free him_ [the said Middleton] _from the charges_, and would\r\nproceed _himself_ to Lucknow, and would _himself_ undertake them.\"\r\n\r\nXIII. That very doubtful credit is to be given to any letters written by\r\nthe said Middleton to the said Warren Hastings, when they answer the\r\npurposes which the said Warren Hastings had evidently in view: the said\r\nMiddleton having written to him in the following manner from Lucknow,\r\n30th December, 1781.\r\n\r\nXIV. \"MY DEAR SIR,--I have this day answered your _public_\r\nletter in the form _you seem to expect_. I hope there is nothing in it\r\nthat may appear to you too pointed. _If you wish the matter to be\r\notherwise understood than I have taken up and stated it, I need not say\r\nI shall be ready to conform to whatever you may prescribe, and to take\r\nupon myself any share of the blame of the (hitherto) non-performance of\r\nthe stipulations made on behalf of the Nabob_: though I do assure you I\r\nmyself represented to his Excellency and the ministers, (conceiving it\r\nto be your desire,) that _the apparent assumption of the reins of his\r\ngovernment_, (for in that light he undoubtedly considered it at the\r\nfirst view,) as specified in the agreement executed by him, was not\r\nmeant to be _fully_ and _literally_ enforced, but that it was necessary\r\n_you should have something to show on your side, as the Company were\r\ndeprived of a benefit without a requital; and upon the faith of this\r\nassurance alone_, I believe I may safely affirm, his Excellency's\r\nobjections to signing the treaty were given up. If I have understood the\r\nmatter wrong, or misconceived your design, I am truly sorry for it:\r\n_however, it is not too late to correct the error; and I am ready to\r\nundertake, and, God willing, to carry through, whatever you may, on\r\nreceipt of my public letter, tell me is your final resolve_.\"\r\n\r\nXV. That it appears, but on his, the said Middleton's, sole authority,\r\nin a letter from the said Middleton, dated Lucknow, 2d December, 1781,\r\nthat the Nabob of Oude, wishing to evade the measure of resuming the\r\njaghires aforesaid, did send a message to him, purporting, \"that, if the\r\nmeasure proposed was intended to procure the payment of the balance due\r\nto the Company, he could better and more expeditiously effect that\r\nobject by taking from his mother the treasures of his father, which he\r\ndid assert to be in her hands, and to which he did claim a right; and\r\nthat it would be sufficient that he, the said Hastings, _would hint his\r\nopinion upon it, without giving a formal sanction to the measure\r\nproposed_; and that, whatever his resolution upon the subject should be,\r\nit would be expedient to keep it secret\": adding, \"_The resumption of\r\nthe jaghires it is necessary to suspend till I have your answer to this\r\nletter_.\"\r\n\r\nXVI. That it does not appear that the said Hastings did write any\r\nletter in answer to the proposal of the said Middleton, but he, the said\r\nHastings, did communicate his pleasure thereon, to Sir Elijah Impey,\r\nbeing then at Lucknow, for his, the said Middleton's, information; and\r\nit does appear that the seizing of the treasures of the mother of the\r\nNabob, said to have been proposed as _an alternative_ by the said Nabob\r\nto prevent the resumption of the jaghires, was determined upon and\r\nordered by the said Hastings,--and that the resumption of the said\r\njaghires, for the ransom of which the seizing of the treasures was\r\nproposed, was also directed: not one only, but both sides of the\r\nalternative, being enforced upon the female parents of the Nabob\r\naforesaid, although both the one and the other had been secured to them\r\nby a treaty with the East India Company.\r\n\r\nXVIII.[60] That Sir Elijah Impey, Knight, his Majesty's chief-justice at\r\nPort William, did undertake a journey of nine hundred miles, from\r\nCalcutta to Lucknow, on pretence of health and pleasure, but was in\r\nreality in the secret of these and other irregular transactions, and\r\nemployed as a channel of confidential communication therein. And the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, by presuming to employ the said chief-justice, a\r\nperson particularly unfit for an agent, in the transaction of affairs\r\n_primâ facie_ at least unjust, violent, and oppressive, contrary to\r\npublic faith, and to the sentiments and law of Nature, and which he, the\r\nsaid Hastings, was sensible \"could not fail to draw obloquy on himself\r\nby his participation,\" did disgrace the king's commission, and render\r\nodious to the natives of Hindostan the justice of the crown of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nXIX. That, although the said Warren Hastings was from the beginning duly\r\ninformed of the violence offered to the personal inclinations of the\r\nNabob, and the \"apparent assumption of the reins of his government,\" for\r\nthe purposes aforesaid, yet more than two years after he did write to\r\nhis private agent, Major Palmer, that is to say, in his letter of the\r\n6th of May, 1783, \"that it has been a matter of _equal surprise and\r\nconcern_ to him to learn from the letters of the Resident that the Nabob\r\nVizier was with difficulty and almost unconquerable reluctance induced\r\nto give his consent to the attachment of the treasure deposited by his\r\nfather under the charge of the Begum, his mother, and to the resumption\r\nof her jaghire, and the other jaghires of the individuals of his\r\nfamily\": which pretence of ignorance of the Nabob's inclinations is\r\nfictitious and groundless. But whatever deception he might pretend to be\r\nin concerning the original intention of the Nabob, he was not, nor did\r\nhe pretend to be, ignorant of his, the Nabob's, reluctance to _proceed_\r\nin the said measures; but did admit his knowledge of the Nabob's\r\nreluctance to their full execution, and yet did justify the same as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nXX. \"I desire that you will inform him [the Nabob], that, in these and\r\nthe other measures which were either proposed by him or received his\r\nconcurrence in the agreement passed between us at Chunar, I neither had\r\nnor could have any object _but his relief, and the strengthening of his\r\nconnection with the Company_; and that I should not on any other ground\r\nhave exposed myself to _the personal obloquy which they could not fail\r\nto draw upon me by my participation in them_, but left him to regulate\r\nby his own discretion and by his own means the economy of his own\r\nfinances, and, _with much more cause, the assertion of his domestic\r\nright. In these he had no regular claim to my interference_; nor had I,\r\nin my public character, any claim upon him, but for the payment of the\r\ndebt then due from him to the Company, although I was under the\r\nstrongest obligations to require it for the relief of the pressing\r\nexigencies of their affairs. He will well remember the manner in which,\r\nat a visit to him in his own tent, I declared my acquiescence freely,\r\nand without hesitation, to each proposition, which afterwards formed the\r\nsubstance of a written agreement, as he severally made them; and he can\r\nwant no other evidence of my motives for _so cheerful a consent_, nor\r\nfor the requests which I added as the means of fulfilling his purposes\r\nin them. Had he not made these measures his own option, I should not\r\nhave proposed them; _but having once adopted them, and made them the\r\nconditions of a formal and sacred agreement, I had no longer an option\r\nto dispense with them, but was bound to the complete performance and\r\nexecution of them, as points of public duty and of national faith, for\r\nwhich I was responsible to my king, and the Company my immediate\r\nsuperiors: and this was the reason for my insisting on their performance\r\nand execution, when I was told that the Nabob himself had relaxed from\r\nhis original purpose, and expressed a reluctance to proceed in it_.\"\r\n\r\nXXI. That the said Warren Hastings does admit that the Nabob _had_\r\noriginally no regular claim upon him for his interference, or he any\r\nclaim on the Nabob, which, might entitle him to interfere in the Nabob's\r\ndomestic concerns; yet, in order to justify his so invidious an\r\ninterference, he did, in the letter aforesaid, give a false account of\r\nthe said treaty, which (as before mentioned) did nothing more than give\r\na _permission_ to the Nabob to resume the jaghires, _if HE should judge\r\nthe same to be necessary_, and did therefore leave the right of\r\ndispensing with the whole, or any part thereof, as much in his option\r\nafter the treaty as it was before: the declared intent of the article\r\nbeing only to remove the restraint of the Company's guaranty forbidding\r\nsuch resumption, but furnishing nothing which could authorize putting\r\nthat resumption into the hands and power of the Company, to be enforced\r\nat their discretion. And with regard to the other part of the spoil made\r\nby order of the said Hastings, and by him in the letter aforesaid stated\r\nto be made equally against the will of the Nabob, namely, that which was\r\ncommitted on the personal and movable property of the female parents of\r\nthe Nabob, nothing whatsoever in relation to the same is stipulated in\r\nthe said pretended treaty.\r\n\r\nXXII. That the said Hastings, in asserting that he was bound to the acts\r\naforesaid by public duty, and even by national faith, in the very\r\ninstance in which that national faith was by him grossly violated, and\r\nin justifying himself by alleging that he was bound to the _complete_\r\nexecution by a responsibility to the Company which he immediately\r\nserved, and by asserting that these violent and rapacious proceedings,\r\nsubjecting all persons concerned in them to obloquy, would be the means\r\nof strengthening the connection of the Nabob with the British United\r\nCompany of Merchants trading to the East Indies, did disgrace the\r\nauthority under which he immediately acted. And that the said Hastings,\r\nin justifying his obligations to the said acts by a responsibility to\r\nthe _king_, namely, to the King of Great Britain, did endeavor to throw\r\nupon his Majesty, his lawful sovereign, (whose name and character he was\r\nbound to respect, and to preserve in estimation with all persons, and\r\nparticularly with the sovereign princes, the allies of his government,)\r\nthe disgrace and odium of the aforesaid acts, in which a sovereign\r\nprince was by him, the said Hastings, made an instrument of perfidy,\r\nwrong, and outrage to two mothers and wives of sovereign princes, and in\r\nwhich he did exhibit to all Asia (a country remarkable for the utmost\r\ndevotion to parental authority) the spectacle of a Christian governor,\r\nrepresenting a Christian sovereign, compelling a son to become the\r\ninstrument of such violence and extortion against his own mother.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, by repeated messages and injunctions, and\r\nunder menaces of \"a dreadful responsibility,\" did urge the Resident to a\r\ncompletion of this barbarous act; and well knowing that such an act\r\nwould probably be resisted, did order him, the said Resident, to use the\r\nBritish troops under his direction for that purpose; and did offer the\r\nassistance of further forces, urging the execution in the following\r\nperemptory terms: \"You _yourself_ must be _personally present_; you must\r\nnot allow _any_ negotiation or forbearance, but must prosecute both\r\nservices, until the Begums [princesses] are at the entire mercy of the\r\nNabob.\"[61]\r\n\r\nXXIII. That, in conformity to the said peremptory orders, a party of\r\nBritish and other troops, with the Nabob in the ostensible, and the\r\nBritish Resident in the real command, were drawn towards the city of\r\nFyzabad, in the castle of which city the mother and grandmother of the\r\nNabob had their residence; and after expending two days in negotiation,\r\n(the particulars of which do not appear,) the Resident not receiving the\r\nsatisfaction he looked for, the town was first stormed, and afterwards\r\nthe castle; and little or no resistance being made, and no blood being\r\nshed on either side, the British troops occupied all the outer inclosure\r\nof the palace of one of the princesses, and blocked up the other.[62]\r\n\r\nXXIV. That this violent assault, and forcible occupation of their\r\nhouses, and the further extremities they had to apprehend, did not\r\nprevail on the female parents of the Nabob to consent to any submission,\r\nuntil the Resident sent in unto them a letter from the said Warren\r\nHastings,[63] (no copy of which appears,) declaring himself no longer\r\nbound by the guaranty, and containing such other matter as tended to\r\nremove all their hopes, which seemed to be centred in British faith.\r\n\r\nXXV. That the chief officers of their household, who were their\r\ntreasurers and confidential agents, the eunuchs Jewar Ali Khân and Behar\r\nAli Khân, persons of great eminence, rank, and distinction, who had been\r\nin high trust and favor with the late Nabob, were ignominiously put into\r\nconfinement under an inferior officer, in order to extort the discovery\r\nof the treasures and effects committed to their care and fidelity. And\r\nthe said Middleton did soon after, that is to say, on the 12th of\r\nJanuary, 1782, deliver them over for the same purpose into the custody\r\nof Captain Neal Stuart, commanding the eighth regiment, by his order\r\ngiven in the following words: \"To be kept in close and secure\r\nconfinement, admitting of no intercourse with them, excepting by their\r\nfour menial servants, who are authorized to attend them until further\r\norders. You will allow them to have any necessary and convenience which\r\nmay be consistent with a strict guard over them.\"\r\n\r\nXXVI. That, in consequence of these severities upon herself, and on\r\nthose whom she most regarded and trusted, the mother of the said Nabob\r\ndid at length consent to the delivering up of her treasures, and the\r\nsame were paid to the Resident, to the amount of the bond given by the\r\nNabob to the Company for his balance of the year 1779-80; and the said\r\ntreasure \"was taken from the most secret recesses in the houses of the\r\ntwo eunuchs.\"\r\n\r\nXXVII. That the Nabob continuing still under the pressure of a further\r\npretended debt to the Company for his balance of the year 1780-81, the\r\nResident, not satisfied with the seizure of the estates and treasures of\r\nhis parents aforesaid, although he, the said Resident, did confess that\r\nthe princess mother \"had declared, _with apparent truth_, that she had\r\ndelivered up _the whole of the property in her hands_, excepting goods\r\nwhich from the experience which he, the Resident, had of the _small\r\nproduce_ of the sales of a former payment made by her in that mode he\r\ndid refuse, and that in his opinion it certainly would have amounted to\r\nlittle or nothing,\" did proceed to extort another great sum of money,\r\nthat is to say, the sum of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds\r\nsterling, on account of the last pretended balance aforesaid: in order,\r\ntherefore, to compel the said ministers and treasurers either to\r\ndistress their principals by extorting whatever valuable substance might\r\nby any possibility remain concealed, or to furnish the said sum from\r\ntheir own estates or from their credit with their friends, did order\r\ntheir imprisonment to be aggravated with circumstances of great cruelty,\r\ngiving an order to Lieutenant Francis Rutledge, dated 20th January,\r\n1782, in the following words.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. \"SIR,--When this note is delivered to you by Hoolas\r\nRoy, I have to desire that you order the two prisoners to be put _in\r\nirons, keeping them from all food, &c., agreeable to my instructions of\r\nyesterday_.\r\n\r\n    (Signed)       \"NATH^L MIDDLETON.\"\r\n\r\nXXIX. That by the said unjust and rigorous proceeding the said eunuchs\r\nwere compelled to give their engagement for the payment of one hundred\r\nand twenty thousand pounds sterling aforesaid, to be completed within\r\nthe period of one month; but after they had entered into the said\r\ncompulsory engagement, they were still kept in close imprisonment, and\r\nthe mother and grandmother of the Nabob were themselves held under a\r\nstrict guard,--although, at the same time, the confiscated estates were\r\nactually in the Company's possession, and found to exceed the amount of\r\nwhat they were rated at in the general list of confiscated estates,[64]\r\nand although the Assistant Resident, Johnson, did confess, \"that the\r\nobject of distressing the Bhow Begum was merely to obtain a\r\n_ready-money_ instead of a _dilatory payment_, and that this ready-money\r\npayment, if not paid, was recoverable in the course of a few months upon\r\nthe jaghires in his possession, and that therefore it was not worth\r\nproceeding to any extremities, beyond the one described,\" (namely, the\r\nconfinement of the princesses, and the imprisonment and fettering of\r\ntheir ministers,) \"upon so respectable a family.\"[65]\r\n\r\nXXX. That, after the surrender of the treasure, and the passing the\r\nbonds and obligations given as aforesaid, the Resident having been\r\nstrictly ordered by the said Warren Hastings not to make any settlement\r\nwhatsoever with the said women of high rank, the Nabob was induced to\r\nleave the city of Fyzabad without taking leave of his mother, or showing\r\nher any mark of duty or civility. And on the same day the Resident left\r\nthe city aforesaid; and after his return to Lucknow, in order to pacify\r\nthe said Hastings, who appeared to resent that the Nabob was not urged\r\nto greater degrees of rigor than those hitherto used towards his mother,\r\nhe, the said Resident, did, in his letter of the 6th February, give him\r\nan assurance in the following words:--\"I shall, as you direct, use my\r\ninfluence to dissuade his Excellency from concluding _any settlement_\r\nuntil I have your further commands.\"\r\n\r\nXXXI. That the payment of the bond last extorted from the eunuchs was\r\nsoon after commenced, and the grandmother, as well as the mother, were\r\nnow compelled to deliver what they declared was _the extent of the\r\nwhole_ of both their possessions, including down to their _table\r\nutensils_; which, as the Resident admitted, \"they had been and were\r\nstill delivering, and that no proof had yet been obtained of their\r\nhaving more.\"\r\n\r\nXXXII. That bullion, jewels, and goods, to the amount of five hundred\r\nthousand pounds and upwards, were actually received by the Resident for\r\nthe use of the Company before the 23d of February, 1782; and there\r\nremained on the said extorted bond no more than about twenty-five\r\nthousand pounds, according to the statement of the eunuchs, and not\r\nabove fifty thousand according to that made by the Resident.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. That, in this advanced state of the delivery of the extorted\r\ntreasure, the ministers of the women aforesaid of the reigning family\r\ndid apply to Captain Leonard Jaques, under whose custody they were\r\nconfined, to be informed of the deficiency with which they stood\r\ncharged, that they might endeavor, with the assistance of their friends,\r\nto provide for the same, and praying that they might through his\r\nmediation be freed from the hardships they suffered under their\r\nconfinement: to which application they received an insolent answer from\r\nthe said Richard Johnson, dated February 27th, 1782, declaring that part\r\nof what he had received in payment was in jewels and bullion, and that\r\nmore than a month, the time fixed for the final payment, would elapse\r\nbefore he could dispose of the same,--insisting upon a ready-money\r\npayment, and assuring them \"that the day on which their agreement\r\nexpired he should be indispensably obliged to recommence severities upon\r\nthem, until the last farthing was fully paid.\" And in order to add to\r\ntheir terrors and hardships, as well as to find some pretext for the\r\nfurther cruel and inhuman acts intended, an apparently groundless and\r\ninjurious charge was suggested to the imprisoned ministers aforesaid in\r\nthe following words. \"You may also mention to them, that I have reason\r\nto _suspect_ that the commotions raised by Bulbudder have not been\r\nwithout their _suggestion and abetment_, which, if proved upon them, in\r\naddition to the _probable_ breach of their agreement, will make their\r\nsituation _very desperate_.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIV. That on the receipt of the said letter, that is, on the 2d March,\r\nthe ministers aforesaid did aver, that they were not able to obtain\r\ncash, in lieu of the jewels and other effects, but that, if the goods\r\nwere sold, and they released from their confinement, and permitted (as\r\nthey have before requested) to go abroad among their friends, they could\r\nsoon make good the deficiency; and they did absolutely deny \"that they\r\nhad any hand in the commotions raised by Bulbudder, or any kind of\r\ncorrespondence with him or his adherents.\"\r\n\r\nXXXV. That the prisoners aforesaid did shortly after, that is to say, on\r\nthe 13th March, a third time renew their application to Nathaniel\r\nMiddleton, Esquire, the Resident, and did request that the jewels\r\nremaining in his, the said Resident's, hands, towards the payment of the\r\nbalance remaining, \"might be valued by four or five eminent merchants,\r\nMussulmen and Hindoos, upon oath,\" and that, if any balance should\r\nafterwards appear, they would upon their release get their friends to\r\nadvance the same; and they did again represent the hardship of their\r\nimprisonment, and pray for relief; and did again assert that the\r\nimputations thrown upon them by the said Richard Johnson were false and\r\ngroundless,--\"that they had no kind of intercourse, either directly or\r\nindirectly, with the authors of the commotions alluded to, and that they\r\ndid stake their lives upon the smallest proof thereof being brought.\"\r\n\r\nXXXVI. That, instead of their receiving any answer to any of the\r\naforesaid reasonable propositions, concerning either the account stated,\r\nor the crimes imputed to them, or any relief from the hardships they\r\nsuffered, he, the Resident, Middleton, did, on the 18th of the said\r\nmonth, give to the officer who had supplicated in favor of the said\r\nprisoners an order in which he declared himself \"under the disagreeable\r\nnecessity of recurring to severities to enforce the said payment, and\r\nthat this is therefore to desire that you immediately cause them _to be\r\nput in irons_, and keep them so until I shall arrive at Fyzabad to take\r\nfurther measures as may be necessary\": which order being received at\r\nFyzabad the day after it was given, the said eunuchs were a second time\r\nthrown into irons. And it appears that (probably in resentment for the\r\nhumane representations of the said Captain Jaques) the Resident did\r\nrefuse to pay for the fetters, and other contingent charges of the\r\nimprisonment of the said ministers of the Nabob's mother, when at the\r\nsame time very liberal contingent allowances were made to other\r\nofficers; and the said Jaques did strongly remonstrate against the same\r\nas follows. \"You have also ordered me to put the prisoners in irons:\r\nthis I have done; yet, as I have no business to purchase fetters, or\r\nsupply them any other way, it is but reasonable that you should order me\r\nto be reimbursed. And why should I add anything more? A late commander\r\nat this place, I am told, draws near as many thousands monthly\r\ncontingencies as my trifling letter for hundreds. However, if you cannot\r\nget my bill paid, be so obliging as to return it, and give me an\r\nopportunity of declaring to the world that I believe I am the first\r\nofficer in the Company's service who has suffered in his property by an\r\nindependent command.\"\r\n\r\nXXXVI. That, in about two months after the said prisoners had continued\r\nin irons in the manner aforesaid, the officer on guard, in a letter of\r\nthe 18th May, did represent to the Resident as follows. \"The prisoners,\r\nBehar and Jewar Ali Khân, who seem to be very sickly, have requested\r\ntheir irons might be taken off for a few days, that they might take\r\nmedicine, and walk about the garden of the place where they are\r\nconfined. Now, as I am sure _they will be equally secure without their\r\nirons as with them_, I think it my duty to inform you of this request: I\r\ndesire to know your pleasure concerning it.\" To which letter the said\r\nofficer did receive a direct refusal, dated 22d May, 1782, in the\r\nfollowing words. \"I am sorry it is not in my power to comply with your\r\nproposal of easing the prisoners for a few days of their fetters. Much\r\nas my humanity may be touched by their sufferings, I should think it\r\ninexpedient to afford them any alleviation while they persist in a\r\nbreach of their contract with me: and, indeed, no indulgence can be\r\nshown them without the authority of the Nabob, who, instead of\r\nconsenting to moderate the rigors of their situation, would be most\r\nwilling to multiply them\":--endeavoring to join the Nabob, whom he well\r\nknew to be reluctant in the whole proceeding, as a party in the\r\ncruelties by which, through the medium of her servants, it was intended\r\nto coerce his mother.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. That the said Resident, in a few days after, that is to say, on\r\nthe 1st June, 1782, in a letter to Major Gilpin, in command at Fyzabad,\r\ndid order the account, as by himself stated, to be read to the\r\nprisoners, and, without taking any notice of their proposal concerning\r\nthe valuation of the effects, or their denial of the offences imputed to\r\nthem, to demand a positive answer relative to the payment, and, \"upon\r\nreceiving from them a negative or unsatisfactory reply, to inform them,\r\nthat, all further negotiation being at an end, they must prepare for\r\ntheir removal to Lucknow, where they would be called upon to answer not\r\nonly their recent breach of faith and solemn engagement, but also to\r\natone for other heavy offences, the punishment of which, as had\r\nfrequently been signified to them, it was in their power to have\r\nmitigated by a proper acquittal of themselves in this transaction.\" By\r\nwhich insinuations concerning the pretended offences of the said unhappy\r\npersons, and the manner by which they were to atone for the same, and by\r\ntheir never having been specifically and directly made, it doth appear\r\nthat the said crimes and offences were charged for the purpose of\r\nextorting money, and not upon principles or for the ends of justice.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. That, after some ineffectual negotiations to make the prisoners\r\npay the money, which it does not appear to have been in their power to\r\npay, they were again threatened by the Resident, in a letter to Major\r\nGilpin, dated 9th June, 1782, in the following terms. \"I wish you to\r\nexplain once more to the prisoners the imprudence and folly of their\r\nconduct in forcing me to a measure which must be attended with\r\nconsequences so very serious to them, and that, when once they are\r\nremoved to Lucknow, it will not be in my power to show them mercy, or to\r\nstand between them and the vengeance of the Nabob. Advise them to\r\nreflect seriously upon the unhappy situation in which they will be\r\ninvolved in one case, and the relief it will be in my power to procure\r\nthem in the other; and let them make their option.\"\r\n\r\nXL. That he, the said Resident, did also, at the same time, receive a\r\nletter from the princess mother, which letter does not appear, but to\r\nwhich only the following insolent return was made,--that is to say: \"The\r\nletter from the Bhow Begum is no ways satisfactory, and I cannot think\r\nof returning an answer to it. Indeed, all correspondence between the\r\nBegum and me has long been stopped; and I request you will be pleased to\r\ninform her that I by no means wish to resume it, or to maintain any\r\nfriendly intercourse with her, until she has made good my claim upon her\r\nfor the balance due.\"\r\n\r\nXLI. That, in consequence of these threats, and to prevent a separation\r\nof the ministers from their mistresses, several plans for the payment of\r\nthe balance were offered, both by the mother of the Nabob and the\r\nprisoners, to which no other objection appears to have been made than\r\nthe length of time required by the parties to discharge the\r\ncomparatively small remainder of the extorted bond: the officer on\r\ncommand declaring, that, conformable to his instructions, he could not\r\nreceive the same.[66]\r\n\r\nXLII. That the prisoners were actually removed from the city of their\r\nresidence to the city of Lucknow, where they arrived on the 24th of\r\nJune, 1782, and were on the next day threatened with severities, \"to\r\nmake them discover where the balance might be procurable.\" And on the\r\n28th, it should seem, that the severities for the purpose aforesaid were\r\ninflicted, at least upon one of them; for the Assistant Resident,\r\nJohnson, did on that day write to Captain Waugh, the officer commanding\r\nthe guard, the letter following, full of disgrace to the honor, justice,\r\nand humanity of the British nation.\r\n\r\nXLIII. \"SIR,--The Nabob having determined _to inflict corporal\r\npunishment upon the prisoners_ under your guard, this is to desire that\r\nhis officers, when they shall come, may have free access to the\r\nprisoners, and _be permitted to do with them as they shall see proper_,\r\nonly taking care that they leave them always under your charge.\"\r\n\r\nXLIV. That the said Richard Johnson did, further to terrify the\r\nprisoners, and to extort by all ways the remainder of the said unjust,\r\noppressive, and rapacious demand, threaten to remove them out of the\r\nNabob's dominions into the castle of Churnagur, in order forever to\r\nseparate them from their principals, and deprive both of their\r\nreciprocal protection and services,[67]--and did order a further guard\r\nto be put on the palace of the grandmother of the Nabob, an ally of the\r\nCompany, and to prevent the entrance of the provisions to her, (which\r\norder relative to the guard only was executed,) and did use sundry\r\nunworthy and insulting menaces both with regard to herself and to her\r\nprincipal ministers.[68]\r\n\r\nXLV. That a proposal was soon after made by the said princess and her\r\ndaughter-in-law, praying that their ministers aforesaid should be\r\nreturned to Fyzabad, and offering to raise a sum of money on that\r\ncondition;[69] as also that they would remove from one of their palaces,\r\nwhilst the English were to be permitted to search the other.[70] But the\r\nAssistant Resident, Johnson, did, instead of a compliance with the\r\nformer of these propositions, send the following orders, dated 23d July,\r\n1782, to the officer commanding the guard on the ministers aforesaid:\r\n\"Some violent demands having been made for the release of the prisoners,\r\nit is necessary that every possible precaution be taken for their\r\nsecurity; you will therefore be pleased to be very strict in guarding\r\nthem; and I herewith send _another pair of fetters to be added to those\r\nnow upon the prisoners_.\" And in answer to the second proposition, the\r\nsaid Resident did reply in the following terms: \"The proposal of\r\nevacuating one palace, that it may be searched, and then evacuating the\r\nnext, upon the same principle, is apparently fair; but it is well known,\r\nin the first place, that such bricked-up or otherwise hidden treasure\r\nis not to be hit upon in a day without a guide. I have therefore\r\ninformed the Nabob of this proposal, and, if the matter is to be reduced\r\nto a search, he will go himself, with such people as he may possess for\r\ninformation, together with the prisoners; and when in possession of the\r\nground, by _punishing the prisoners_, or by such _other means as he may\r\nfind most effectual_ to forward a successful search upon the spot, he\r\nwill avail himself of the proposal made by the Bhow Begum.\"\r\n\r\nXLVI. That, probably from the Nabob's known and avowed reluctance to\r\nlend himself to the perpetration of the oppressive and iniquitous\r\nproceedings of the representative of the British government, the\r\nscandalous plan aforesaid was not carried into execution; and all the\r\nrigors practised upon the chief ministers of the ladies aforesaid at\r\nLucknow being found ineffectual, and the princess mother having declared\r\nherself ready to deliver up everything valuable in her possession, which\r\nBehar Ali Khân, one of her confidential ministers aforesaid, only could\r\ncome at, the said change of prison was agreed to,--but not until the\r\nNabob's mother aforesaid had engaged to pay for the said change of\r\nprison a sum of ten thousand pounds, (one half of which was paid on the\r\nreturn of the eunuchs,) and that \"she would ransack the _zenanah_\r\n[women's apartments] for kincobs, muslins, clothes, &c., &c., &c., and\r\nthat she would even allow a deduction from the annual allowance made to\r\nher for her subsistence in lieu of her jaghire.\"[71]\r\n\r\nXLVII. That, soon after the return of the aforesaid ministers to the\r\nplace of their imprisonment at Fyzabad, bonds for the five thousand\r\npounds aforesaid, and goods, estimated, according to the valuation of a\r\nmerchant appointed to value the same, at the sum of forty thousand\r\npounds, even allowing them to sell greatly under their value, were\r\ndelivered to the commanding officer at Fyzabad; and the said commanding\r\nofficer did promise to the Begum to visit Lucknow with such proposals as\r\nhe hoped would secure the _small balance_ of fifteen thousand pounds\r\nremaining of the unjust exaction aforesaid.[72] But the said Resident,\r\nMiddleton, did, in his letter of the 17th of the said month, positively\r\nrefuse to listen to any terms before the final discharge of the whole of\r\nthe demand, and did positively forbid the commanding officer to come to\r\nLucknow to make the proposal aforesaid in the terms following. \"As it is\r\nnot possible to listen to _any_ terms from the Begums before the final\r\ndischarge of their conditional agreement for fifty-five lacs, your\r\ncoming here upon such an agency can only be _loss of time_ in completing\r\nthe recovery of the balance of 6,55,000, for which your regiment was\r\nsent to Fyzabad. I must therefore desire you will leave _no efforts,\r\ngentle or harsh_, unattempted to complete this, before you move from\r\nFyzabad; and I am very anxious that this should be as soon as possible,\r\n_as I want to employ your regiment upon other emergent service, now\r\nsuffering by every delay_.\"\r\n\r\nXLVIII. That the goods aforesaid were sent to Lucknow, and disposed of\r\nin a manner unknown; and the harsh and oppressive measures aforesaid\r\nbeing still continued, the Begum did, about the middle of October,\r\n1782, cause to be represented to the said Middleton as follows. \"That\r\nher situation was truly pitiable,--her estate sequestered, her treasury\r\nransacked, her cojahs prisoners, and her servants deserting daily from\r\nwant of subsistence. That she had solicited the loan of money, to\r\nsatisfy the demands of the Company, from every person that she imagined\r\nwould or could assist her with any; but that the opulent would not\r\nlisten to her adversity. She had hoped that the wardrobe sent to Lucknow\r\nmight have sold for at least one half of the Company's demands on her;\r\nbut even jewelry and goods, she finds from woful experience, lose their\r\nvalue the moment it is known they come from her. That she had now\r\nsolicited the loan of cash from Almas Ali Khân, and if she failed in\r\nthat application, she had no hopes of ever borrowing a sum equal to the\r\ndemand\":[73]--an hope not likely to be realized, as the said Almas Ali\r\nwas then engaged for a sum of money to be raised for the Company's use\r\non the security of their confiscated lands, the restoration of which\r\ncould form the only apparent security for a loan.\r\n\r\nXLIX. That this remonstrance produced no effect on the mind of the\r\naforesaid Resident,--who, being about this time removed from his\r\nResidency, did, in a letter to his successor, Mr. Bristow, dated 23d\r\nOctober, 1782, in effect recommend a perseverance in the cruel and\r\noppressive restraints aforesaid as a certain means of recovering the\r\nremainder of the extorted bond, and that the lands with which the\r\nprincesses aforesaid had been endowed should not be restored to them.\r\n\r\nL. That the said Warren Hastings was duly apprised of all the material\r\ncircumstances in the unjust proceedings aforesaid, but did nothing to\r\nstop the course they were in, or to prevent, relieve, or mitigate the\r\nsufferings of the parties affected by them: on the contrary, he did, in\r\nhis letter of the 25th of January, 1782, to the Resident, Middleton,\r\ndeclare, that the Nabob having consented to the \"resumption of the\r\njaghires held by the Begums, and to the confiscation of their treasures,\r\nand thereby involved my own name and the credit of the Company in a\r\nparticipation of both measures, I have a right to _require and insist on\r\nthe complete execution of them_; and I look to you for their execution,\r\ndeclaring that I shall hold you accountable for it.\" And it appears that\r\nhe did write to the Nabob a letter in the same peremptory manner; but\r\nthe said letter has been suppressed.\r\n\r\nLI. That he, the said Hastings, farther did manifest the concern he took\r\nin, and the encouragement which he gave to the proceedings aforesaid, by\r\nconferring honors and distinctions upon the ministers of the Nabob, whom\r\nhe, the Nabob, did consider as having in the said proceedings disobeyed\r\nhim and betrayed him, and as instruments in the dishonor of his family\r\nand the usurpation of his authority. That the said ministers did make\r\naddresses to the said Hastings for that purpose (which addresses the\r\nsaid Hastings hath suppressed); and the Resident, Middleton, did, with\r\nhis letter of the 11th of February, 1782, transmit the same, and did in\r\nthe said letter acquaint the said Hastings \"that the ministers of the\r\nNabob had incurred much odium on account of their participation in his\r\nmeasures, and that they were not only considered by the party of the\r\ndispossessed jaghiredars, and the mother and uncle of the Nabob, but _by\r\nthe Nabob himself_, as the _dependants of the English government, which\r\nthey certainly are, and it is by its declared and most obvious support\r\nalone_ that they can maintain the authority and influence which is\r\nindispensably necessary.\" And the said Middleton did therefore recommend\r\n\"that they should be honored with some testimony of his [the said\r\nHastings's] approbation and favor.\" And he, the said Warren Hastings,\r\ndid send _kellauts_, or robes of honor, (the most public and\r\ndistinguished mode of acknowledging merit known in India,) to the said\r\nministers, in testimony of his approbation of their late services.\r\n\r\nLII. That the said Hastings did not only give the aforesaid public\r\nencouragement to the ministers of the Nabob to betray and insult their\r\nmaster and his family in the manner aforesaid, but, when the said Nabob\r\ndid write several letters to him, the said Hastings, expressive of his\r\ndislike of being used as an instrument in the dishonorable acts\r\naforesaid, and refusing to be further concerned therein, he, the said\r\nWarren Hastings, did not only suppress and hide the said letters from\r\nthe view of the Court of Directors, but in his instructions to the\r\nResident, Bristow, did attribute them to Hyder Beg Khân, minister to the\r\nNabob, (whom in other respects he did before and ever since support\r\nagainst his master,) and did express himself with great scorn and\r\ncontempt of the said Nabob, and with much asperity against the said\r\nminister: affirming, in proud and insolent terms, that he had, \"by an\r\nabuse of his influence over the Nabob,--he, the Nabob himself, being\r\n(_as he ever must be in the hands of some person_) _a mere cipher in\r\nhis [the said minister's],--dared_ to make him [the Nabob] _assume_ a\r\nvery _unbecoming_ tone of refusal, reproach, and resentment, in\r\nopposition to _measures recommended by ME_, and even to _acts done by MY\r\nauthority_\": the said Hastings, in the instruction aforesaid,\r\nparticularizing the resumption of the jaghires, and the confiscation of\r\nthe treasures that had been so long suffered to remain in the hands of\r\nhis, the Nabob's, mother. But the letters of the Nabob, which in the\r\nsaid instructions he refers to as containing an opposition to the\r\nmeasures recommended by him, and which he asserts was conveyed in a very\r\nunbecoming tone of refusal, reproach, and resentment, he, the said\r\nHastings, hath criminally withheld from the Company, contrary to their\r\norders, and to his duty,--and the more, as the said letters must tend to\r\nshow in what manner the said Nabob did feel the indignities offered to\r\nhis mother, and the manner in which the said ministers, notwithstanding\r\ntheir known dependence on the English government, did express their\r\nsense of the part which their sovereign was compelled to act in the said\r\ndisgraceful measures. And in farther instructions to him, the said new\r\nResident, he did declare his approbation of the evil acts aforesaid, as\r\nwell as his resolution of compelling the Nabob to those rigorous\r\nproceedings against his parent from which he had long shown himself so\r\nvery averse, in the following words. \"The severities which have been\r\nincreased towards the Begums were most justly merited by the advantage\r\nwhich they took of the troubles in which I was personally involved last\r\nyear, to create a rebellion in the Nabob's government, and to complete\r\nthe ruin which they thought was impending on ours. If it is the Nabob's\r\ndesire to forget and to forgive their past offence, I have no objection\r\nto his allowing them, in pension, the nominal amount of their jaghires;\r\nbut if he shall _ever offer_ to restore their jaghires to them, or to\r\ngive them any property in land, after the warning which they have given\r\nhim by the dangerous abuse which they formerly made of his indulgence,\r\nyou must remonstrate in the strongest terms against it; _you must not\r\npermit such an event to take place_, until this government shall have\r\nreceived information of it, and shall have had time to interpose its\r\ninfluence for the prevention of it.\" And the said Warren Hastings, who\r\ndid in the manner aforesaid positively refuse to admit the Nabob to\r\nrestore to his mother and grandmother any part of their landed estates\r\nfor their maintenance, did well know that the revenues of the said Nabob\r\nwere at that time so far applied to the demands of the Company, (by him,\r\nthe said Warren Hastings, aggravated beyond the whole of what they did\r\nproduce,) or were otherwise so far applied to the purposes of several of\r\nthe servants of the Company, and others, the dependants of him, the said\r\nHastings, that none of the pensions or allowances, assigned by the said\r\nNabob in lieu of the estates confiscated, were paid, or were likely to\r\nbe discharged, with that punctuality which was necessary even to the\r\nscanty subsistence of the persons to which they were in name and\r\nappearance applied. For,\r\n\r\nLIII. That, so early as the 6th March, 1782, Captain Leonard Jaques, who\r\ncommanded the forces on duty for the purpose of distressing the several\r\nwomen in the palaces at Fyzabad, did complain to the Resident, Richard\r\nJohnson, in the following words. \"The women belonging to the Khord\r\nMohul (or lesser palace) complain of their being in want of every\r\nnecessary of life, and are at last driven to that desperation that they\r\nat night get on the top of the zenanah, make a great disturbance, and\r\nlast night not only alarmed the sentinels posted in the garden, but\r\nthrew dirt at them; they threaten to throw themselves from the walls of\r\nthe zenanah, and also to break out of it. Humanity obliges me to\r\nacquaint you of this matter, and to request to know if you have any\r\ndirections to give me concerning it. I also beg leave to acquaint you I\r\nsent for Letafit Ali Khân, the cojah who has the charge of them, and who\r\ninforms me it is well grounded,--that they _have sold everything they\r\nhad, even to the clothes from their backs, and now have no means of\r\nsubsisting_.\"\r\n\r\nLIV. That the distresses of the said women grew so urgent on the night\r\nof the said 6th of March, the day when the letter above recited was\r\nwritten, that Captain Leonard Jaques aforesaid did think it necessary to\r\nwrite again, on the day following, to the British Resident in the\r\nfollowing words. \"I beg leave to address you again concerning the women\r\nin the Khord Mohul [the lesser palace]. Their behavior last night was so\r\nfurious, that there seemed the greatest probability of their proceeding\r\nto the uttermost extremities, and that they would either _throw\r\nthemselves from the walls or force open the doors of the zenanah_. I\r\nhave made every inquiry concerning the cause of their complaints, and\r\nfind from Letafit Ali Khân that they are in _a starving condition,\r\nhaving sold all their clothes and necessaries, and now have not\r\nwherewithal to support nature_; and as my instructions are quite silent\r\non this head, I should be glad to know how to proceed, in case they were\r\nto force the doors of the zenanah, as I suspect it will happen, should\r\nno subsistence be very quickly sent to them.\"\r\n\r\nLV. That, in consequence of these representations, it appears that the\r\nsaid Resident, Richard Johnson, did promise that an application should\r\nbe made to certain of the servants of the Nabob Vizier to provide for\r\ntheir subsistence.\r\n\r\nLVI. That Captain Jaques being relieved from the duty of imprisoning the\r\nwomen of Sujah ul Dowlah, the late sovereign of Oude, an ally of the\r\nCompany, who dwelt in the said lesser palace, and Major Gilpin being\r\nappointed to succeed, the same malicious design of destroying the said\r\nwomen, or the same scandalous neglect of their preservation and\r\nsubsistence, did still continue; and Major Gilpin found it necessary to\r\napply to the new Resident, Bristow, in a letter of the 30th of October,\r\n1782, as follows.\r\n\r\nLVII. \"SIR,--Last night, about eight o'clock, the women in the\r\nKhord Mohul [lesser palace] or zenanah [women's apartment] under the\r\ncharge of Letafit Ali Khân, assembled on the tops of the buildings,\r\n_crying in a most lamentable manner for food,--that for the last four\r\ndays they had got but a very scanty allowance, and that yesterday they\r\nhad got none_.\r\n\r\nLVIII. \"_The melancholy cries of famine are more easily imagined than\r\ndescribed_; and from their representation I fear the Nabob's agents for\r\nthat business are very inattentive. I therefore think it requisite to\r\nmake you acquainted with the circumstance, that his Excellency, the\r\nNabob, may cause his agents to be more circumspect in their conduct\r\ntowards these poor unhappy women.\"\r\n\r\nLIX. That, although the Resident, Bristol, did not then think himself\r\nauthorized to remove the guard, he did apply to the minister of the\r\nNabob, who did promise some relief to the women of the late Nabob,\r\nconfined in the lesser palace; but apprehending, with reason, that the\r\nminister aforesaid might not be more ready or active in making the\r\nnecessary provision for them than on former occasions, he did render\r\nhimself personally responsible to Major Gilpin for the repayment of any\r\nsum, equal to one thousand pounds sterling, which he might procure for\r\nthe subsistence of the sufferers. But whatever relief was given, (the\r\namount thereof not appearing,) the same was soon exhausted; and the\r\nnumber of persons to be maintained in the said lesser palace being eight\r\nhundred women, the women of the late sovereign, Sujah ul Dowlah, and\r\nseveral of the younger children of the said sovereign prince, besides\r\ntheir attendants, Major Gilpin was obliged, on the 15th of November\r\nfollowing, again to address the Resident by a representation of this\r\ntenor.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--The repeated cries of the women in the Khord Mohul\r\nZenanah for subsistence have been truly melancholy.\r\n\r\nLX. \"_They beg most piteously for liberty, that they may earn their\r\ndaily bread by laborious servitude, or to be relieved from their misery\r\nby immediate death._\r\n\r\nLXI. \"In consequence of their unhappy situation, I have this day taken\r\nthe liberty of drawing on you in favor of Ramnarain, at ten days' sight,\r\nfor twenty Son Kerah rupees, ten thousand of which I have paid to Cojah\r\nLetafit Ali Khân, under whose charge that zenanah is.\"\r\n\r\nLXII. That, notwithstanding all the promises and reiterated engagements\r\nof the minister, Hyder Beg Khân, the ladies of the palace aforesaid fell\r\nagain into extreme distress; and the Resident did again complain to the\r\nsaid minister, who was considered to be, and really and substantially\r\nwas, the minister of the Governor-General, Warren Hastings, aforesaid,\r\nand not of the Nabob, (the said Nabob being, according to the said\r\nHastings's own account, \"a cipher in his [the said minister's] hands,\")\r\nthat the funds allowed for their subsistence were not applied to their\r\nsupport. But notwithstanding all these repeated complaints and\r\nremonstrances, and the constant promise of amendment on the part of his,\r\nthe said Hastings's, minister, the supply was not more plentiful or more\r\nregular than before.\r\n\r\nLXIII. That the said Resident, Bristow, finding by experience the\r\ninefficacy of the courses which had been pursued with regard to the\r\nmother and grandmother of the reigning prince of Oude, and having\r\nreceived a report from Major Gilpin, informing him that all which could\r\nbe done by force had been done, and that the only hope which remained\r\nfor realizing the remainder of the money, unjustly exacted as aforesaid,\r\nlay in more lenient methods,[74] he, the said Resident, did, of his own\r\nauthority, order the removal of the guard from the palaces, the troops\r\nbeing long and much wanted for the defence of the frontier, and other\r\nmaterial services,--and did release the said ministers of the said women\r\nof rank, who had been confined and put in irons, and variously\r\ndistressed and persecuted, as aforerecited, for near twelve months.[75]\r\n\r\nLXIV. That the manner in which the said inhuman acts of rapacity and\r\nviolence were felt, both by the women of high rank concerned, and by all\r\nthe people, strongly appears in the joy expressed on their release,\r\nwhich took place on the 5th of December, 1782, and is stated in two\r\nletters of that date from Major Gilpin to the Resident, in the words\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nLXV. \"I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2d\r\ninstant, and in consequence immediately enlarged the prisoners Behar Ali\r\nKhân and Jewar Ali Khân from their confinement: a circumstance that gave\r\nthe Begums, and the city of Fyzabad in general, the greatest\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nLXVI. \"In tears of joy Behar and Jewar Ali Khân expressed their sincere\r\nacknowledgments to the Governor-General, his Excellency the Nabob\r\nVizier, and to you, Sir, for restoring them to that invaluable blessing,\r\nliberty, for which they would ever retain the most grateful remembrance;\r\nand at their request I transmit you the inclosed letters.\r\n\r\nLXVII. \"I wish you had been present at the enlargement of the\r\nprisoners. The quivering lips, with the tears of joy stealing down the\r\npoor men's cheeks, was a scene truly affecting.\r\n\r\nLXVIII. \"If the prayers of these poor men will avail, you will, at the\r\nLAST TRUMP, be translated to the happiest regions in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nLXIX. And the Resident, Bristow, knowing how acceptable the said\r\nproceeding would be to all the people of Oude, and the neighboring\r\nindependent countries, did generously and politically, (though not\r\ntruly,) in his letter to the princess mother attribute the said relief\r\ngiven to herself, and the release of her ministers, to the humanity of\r\nthe said Warren Hastings, agreeably to whose orders he pretended to act:\r\nasserting, that he, the said Hastings, \"was the spring from whence she\r\nwas restored to her dignity and consequence.\"[76] And the account of the\r\nproceedings aforesaid was regularly transmitted to the said Warren\r\nHastings on the 30th of December, 1782, with the reasons and motives\r\nthereto, and a copy of the report of the officer concerning the\r\ninutility of further force, attended with sundry documents concerning\r\nthe famishing, and other treatment, of the women and children of the\r\nlate sovereign: but the same appear to have made no proper impression on\r\nthe mind of the said Warren Hastings; for no answer whatsoever was given\r\nto the said letter until the 3d of March, 1783, when the said Hastings,\r\nwriting in his own character and that of the Council, did entirely pass\r\nby all the circumstances before recited, but did give directions for the\r\nrenewal of measures of the like nature and tendency with those which\r\n(for several of the last months at least of the said proceeding) had\r\nbeen employed with so little advantage to the interest and with so much\r\ninjury to the reputation of the Company, his masters, in whose name he\r\nacted,--expressing himself in the said letter of the 3d of March, 1783,\r\nas follows: \"We desire you will inform us what means have been taken for\r\nrecovering the balance [the pretended balance of the extorted money] due\r\nfrom the Begums [princesses] at Fyzabad; and if necessary, you must\r\nrecommend it to the Vizier _to enforce the most effectual means_ for\r\nthat purpose.\" And the Resident did, in his answer to the board, dated\r\n31st March, 1783, on this peremptory order, again detail the particulars\r\naforesaid to the said Warren Hastings, referring him to his former\r\ncorrespondence, stating the utter impossibility of proceeding further by\r\nforce, and mentioning certain other disgraceful and oppressive\r\ncircumstances, and in particular, that the Company did not, in\r\nplundering the mother of the reigning prince of her wearing apparel and\r\nbeasts of carriage, receive a value in the least equal to the loss she\r\nsuffered: the elephants having no buyer but the Nabob, and the clothes,\r\nwhich had last been delivered to Middleton at a valuation of thirty\r\nthousand pounds, were so damaged by ill keeping in warehouses, that they\r\ncould not be sold, even for six months' credit, at much more than about\r\neight thousand pounds; by which a loss in a single article was incurred\r\nof twenty-two thousand pounds out of the fifty, for the recovery of\r\nwhich (supposing it had been a just debt) such rigorous means had been\r\nemployed, after having actually received upwards of five hundred\r\nthousand pounds in value to the Company, and extorted much more in loss\r\nto the suffering individuals. And the said Bristow, being well\r\nacquainted with the unmerciful temper of the said Hastings, in order to\r\nleave no means untried to appease him, not contented with the letter to\r\nthe Governor-General and Council, did on the same day write another\r\nletter _to him particularly_, in which he did urge several arguments,\r\nthe necessity of using of which to the said Hastings did reflect great\r\ndishonor on this nation, and on the Christian religion therein\r\nprofessed, namely: \"That he had experienced great embarrassment in\r\ntreating with her [the mother of the reigning prince]; for, as the\r\nmother of the Vizier, the people look up to her with respect, and any\r\nhard measures practised against women of her high rank create\r\ndiscontent, and affect our national character.\" And the said Resident,\r\nafter condemning very unjustly her conduct, added, \"Still she is the\r\nmother of the prince of the country, and the religious prejudices of\r\nMussulmen prevail too strongly in their minds to forget her situation.\"\r\n\r\nLXX. That the said Warren Hastings did not make any answer to the said\r\nletter. But the mother of the prince aforesaid, as well as the mother of\r\nhis father, being, in consequence of his, the said Hastings's,\r\ndirections, incessantly and rudely pressed by their descendant, in the\r\nname of the Company, to pay to the last farthing of the demand, they did\r\nboth positively refuse to pay any part of the pretended balances\r\naforesaid, until their landed estates were restored to them; on the\r\nsecurity of which alone they alleged themselves to be in a condition to\r\nborrow any money, or even to provide for the subsistence of themselves\r\nand their numerous dependants. And in order to put some end to these\r\ndifferences, the Vizier did himself, about the beginning of August,\r\n1783, go to Fyzabad, and did hold divers conferences with his parents,\r\nand did consent and engage to restore to them their landed estates\r\naforesaid, and did issue an order that they should be restored\r\naccordingly; but his minister aforesaid, having before his eyes the\r\nperemptory orders of him, the said Warren Hastings, did persuade his\r\nmaster to dishonor himself in breaking his faith and engagement with his\r\nmother and the mother of his father, by first evading the execution, and\r\nafterwards totally revoking his said public and solemn act, on pretence\r\nthat he had agreed to the grant \"from shame, being in their presence\r\n[the presence of his mother and grandmother], and that it was\r\nunavoidable at the time\";[77]--the said minister declaring to him, that\r\nit would be sufficient, if he allowed them \"money for their _necessary_\r\nexpenses, and that would be _doing enough_.\"\r\n\r\nLXXI. That the faith given for the restoration of their landed estates\r\nbeing thus violated, and the money for necessary expenses being as ill\r\nsupplied as before, the women and children of the late sovereign, father\r\nof the reigning prince, continued exposed to frequent want of the common\r\nnecessaries of life;[78] and being sorely pressed by famine, they were\r\ncompelled to break through all the principles of local decorum and\r\nreserve which constitute the dignity of the female sex in that part of\r\nthe world, and, after great clamor and violent attempts for one whole\r\nday to break the inclosure of the palace, and to force their way into\r\nthe public market, in order to move the compassion of the people, and to\r\nbeg their bread, they did, on the next day, actually proceed to the\r\nextremity of exposing themselves to public view,--an extremity implying\r\nthe lowest state of disgrace and degradation, to avoid which many women\r\nin India have laid violent hands upon themselves,--and they did proceed\r\nto the public market-place with the starving children of the late\r\nsovereign, and the brothers and sisters of the reigning prince! A minute\r\naccount of the transaction aforesaid was written to the British Resident\r\nat Lucknow by the person appointed to convey intelligence to him from\r\nFyzabad, in the following particulars, highly disgraceful to the honor,\r\njustice, and humanity of this nation.\r\n\r\nLXXII. \"The ladies, their attendants and servants, were still as\r\nclamorous as last night. Letafit, the _darogah_, went to them and\r\nremonstrated with them on the impropriety of their conduct, at the same\r\ntime assuring them that in a few days all their allowances would be\r\npaid, and should not that be the case, he would advance them ten days'\r\nsubsistence, upon condition that they returned to their habitation. None\r\nof them, however, consented to his proposals, but were still intent upon\r\nmaking their escape through the _bazar_ [market-place], and in\r\nconsequence formed themselves into a line, arranging themselves in the\r\nfollowing order: the children in the front; behind them the ladies of\r\nthe seraglio; and behind them again their attendants: but their\r\nintentions were frustrated by the opposition which they met from\r\nLetafit's sepoys.\r\n\r\nLXXIII. \"The next day Letafit went twice to the women, and used his\r\nendeavors to make them return into the zenanah, promising to advance\r\nthem ten thousand rupees; which, upon the money being paid down, they\r\nagreed to comply with: but night coming on, nothing transpired.\r\n\r\nLXXIV. \"On the day following their clamors were more violent than usual.\r\nLetafit went to confer with them, upon the business of yesterday;\r\noffering the same terms. Depending upon the fidelity of his promises,\r\nthey consented to return to their apartments, which they accordingly\r\ndid, except two or three of the ladies, and most of their attendants.\r\nLetafit then went to Hossmund Ali Khân, to consult with him upon what\r\nmeans they should take. They came to a resolution of driving them in by\r\nforce, and gave orders to their sepoys to beat any one of the women who\r\nshould attempt to move forward. The sepoys consequently assembled; and\r\neach one being provided with a bludgeon, they drove them by dint of\r\nbeating into the zenanah. The women, seeing the treachery of Letafit,\r\nproceeded to throw stones and bricks at the sepoys, and again attempted\r\nto get out; but finding that impossible, from the gates being shut, they\r\nkept up a continual discharge of stones and bricks till about ten, when,\r\nfinding their situation desperate, they retired into the Kung Mohul, and\r\nforced their way from thence into the palace, and dispersed themselves\r\nabout the house and garden; after this they were desirous of getting\r\ninto the Begum's apartment, but she, being apprised of their intention,\r\nordered her doors to be shut. In the mean time Letafit and Hossmund Ali\r\nKhân posted sentries to secure the gates of the lesser Mohul. During\r\nthe whole of this conflict, all the ladies and women remained exposed to\r\nthe view of the sepoys. The Begum then sent for Letafit and Hossmund Ali\r\nKhân, whom she severely reprimanded, and insisted upon knowing the\r\ncauses of this infamous behavior. They pleaded in their defence the\r\nimpossibility of helping it, as the treatment the women had met with had\r\nbeen conformable to his Excellency the Vizier's orders. The Begum\r\nalleged, that, even admitting that the Nabob had given those orders,\r\nthey were by no means authorized in this manner to disgrace the family\r\nof Sujah Dowlah; and should they not receive their allowance for a day\r\nor two, it could be of no great moment: what was passed was now at an\r\nend; but that the Vizier should certainly be acquainted with the whole\r\nof the affair, and that whatever he desired she should implicitly comply\r\nwith. The Begum then sent for five of the children, who were wounded in\r\nthe affray of last night, and, after endeavoring to soothe them, she\r\nsent again for Letafit and Hossmund Ali Khân, and in the presence of the\r\nchildren expressed her disapprobation of their conduct, and the\r\nimprobability of Asoph ul Dowlah's suffering the ladies and children of\r\nSujah Dowlah to be disgraced by being exposed to the view of the rabble.\r\nUpon which Letafit produced the letter from the Nabob, at the same time\r\nrepresenting that he was amenable only to the orders of his Excellency,\r\nand that whatever he ordered it was his duty to obey, and that, had the\r\nladies thought proper to have retired into their apartments quietly, he\r\nwould not have used the means he had taken to compel them. The Begum\r\nagain observed, that what had happened was now over. She then gave the\r\nchildren four hundred rupees, and dismissed them, and sent word by\r\nJumrud and the other eunuchs, that, if the ladies would peaceably retire\r\nto their apartments, Letafit would supply them with three or four\r\nthousand rupees for their personal expenses, and recommended to them not\r\nto incur any further disgrace, and that, if they did not think proper to\r\nact agreeable to her directions, they would do wrong. The ladies\r\nfollowed her advice, and about ten at night went back into the zenanah.\r\nThe nest morning the Begum waited upon the mother of Sujah Dowlah, and\r\nrelated to her all the circumstances of the disturbances. The mother of\r\nSujah Dowlah returned for answer, that, after there being no accounts\r\nkept of crores of revenues, she was not surprised that the family of\r\nSujah Dowlah, in their endeavors to procure a subsistence, should be\r\nobliged to expose themselves to the meanest of the people. After\r\nbewailing their misfortunes, and shedding many tears, the Begum took her\r\nleave, and returned home.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said affecting narrative being sent, with others of the same\r\nnature, on the 29th of January, 1784, to the said Warren Hastings, he\r\ndid not order any relief in consequence thereof, or take any sort of\r\nnotice whatsoever of the said intelligence.\r\n\r\nLXXV. That the Court of Directors did express strong doubts of the\r\npropriety of seizing the estates aforesaid, and did declare to him, the\r\nsaid Hastings, \"that the only consolation they felt on the occasion is,\r\nthat the amount of those jaghires _for which the Company were\r\nguaranties_ is to be paid _through our Resident at the court of the\r\nVizier_; and it very materially concerns the credit of your Governor on\r\nno account to _suffer such payments to be evaded_.\" But the said Warren\r\nHastings did never make the arrangement supposed in the said letter to\r\nbe actually made, nor did he cause the Resident to pay them the amount\r\nof their jaghires, or to make any payment to them.\r\n\r\nAnd the said Hastings being expressly ordered by the Court of Directors\r\nto restore to them their estates, in case the charges made upon them\r\nshould not be found true, he, the said Hastings, did contumaciously and\r\ncruelly decline any compliance with the said orders until his journey to\r\nLucknow, in ----, when he did, as he says, \"conformably to the orders of\r\nthe Court of Directors, and more to the inclination of the Nabob Vizier,\r\nrestore to them their jaghires, but with the defalcation, according to\r\nhis own account, of _a large portion_ of their respective shares\":\r\npretending, without the least probability, that the said defalcation was\r\na \"voluntary concession on their part.\" But what he has left to them for\r\ntheir support, or in what proportion to that which he has taken away, he\r\nhas nowhere stated to the Court of Directors, whose faith he has broken,\r\nand whose orders he has thus eluded, whilst he pretended to yield _some_\r\nobedience to them.\r\n\r\nLXXVI. That the said Warren Hastings having made a malicious, loose, and\r\nill-supported charge, backed by certain unsatisfactory affidavits, as a\r\nground for his seizing on the jaghires and the treasures of the Vizier's\r\nmother, solemnly guarantied to them, the Court of Directors did, in\r\ntheir letter of the 14th of February, 1783, express themselves as\r\nfollows concerning that measure,--\"which the Governor-General, [he, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings,] in his letter to your board, the 23d of January,\r\n1782, has declared _he strenuously encouraged and supported_: we hope\r\nand trust, for the honor of the British nation, that the measure\r\nappeared fully justified in the eyes of all Hindostan. The\r\nGovernor-General has informed us that it can be well attested that the\r\nBegums [the mother and grandmother of the Nabob aforesaid] _principally_\r\nexcited and supported the late commotions, and that they carried their\r\ninveteracy to the English nation so far _as to aim at our utter\r\nextirpation_.\" And the Court of Directors did farther declare as\r\nfollows: \"That it nowhere appears from the papers at present in our\r\npossession, that they [the mother and grandmother of the Nabob of Oude]\r\nexcited any commotions previous to the imprisonment of Rajah Cheyt Sing,\r\nand only armed themselves in consequence of that transaction; and, as it\r\nis probable, that such a conduct proceeded from motives of\r\nself-defence, under an apprehension that they themselves might likewise\r\nbe laid under unwarrantable contributions.\" And the said Court of\r\nDirectors, in giving their orders for the restoration of the jaghires,\r\nor for the payment of an equivalent through the Resident, did give this\r\norder for the restoration of their estates as aforesaid on condition\r\nthat it should appear from inquiry that they were not guilty of the\r\npractices charged upon them by the said Hastings. Mr. Stables, one of\r\nthe Council-General, did, in execution of the said conditional order,\r\npropose an inquiry leading to the ascertainment of the condition, and\r\ndid enter a minute as follows: \"That the Court of Directors, by their\r\nletters of the 14th of February, 1783, seem not to be satisfied that the\r\ndisaffection of the Begums to this government is sufficiently proved by\r\nthe evidence before them; I therefore think that the late and present\r\nResident, and commanding officer in the Vizier's country at the time,\r\nshould be called on to collect what further information they can on this\r\nsubject, in which the honor and dignity of this government is so\r\n_materially concerned_, and that such information may be transmitted to\r\nthe Court of Directors.\" And he did further propose heads and modes of\r\ninquiry suitable to the doubts expressed by the Court of Directors. But\r\nthe said Warren Hastings, who ought long before, on principles of\r\nnatural justice, to have instituted a diligent inquiry in support of his\r\nso improbable a charge, and was bound, even for his own honor, as well\r\nas for the satisfaction of the Court of Directors, to take a strong part\r\nin the said inquiry, did set himself in opposition to the same, and did\r\ncarry with him a majority of Council against the said inquiry into the\r\njustice of the cause, or any proposition for the relief of the\r\nsufferers: asserting, \"that the reasons of the Court of Directors, if\r\ntransmitted with the orders for the inquiry, will prove in effect an\r\norder for collecting evidence _to the justification and acquittal of the\r\nBegums, and not for the investigation of the truth of the charges which\r\nhave been preferred against them_.\" That Mr. Stables did not propose (as\r\nin the said Hastings's minute is groundlessly supposed) that the reasons\r\nof the Court of Directors should be transmitted with the orders for an\r\ninquiry. But the apprehension of the said Warren Hastings of the\r\nprobable result of the inquiry proposed did strongly indicate his sense\r\nof his own guilt and the innocence of the parties accused by him; and\r\nif, by his construction, Mr. Stables's minute did indicate an inquiry\r\nmerely for the justification of the parties by him accused, (which\r\nconstruction the motion did not bear,) it was no more than what the\r\nobvious rules of justice would well support, his own proceedings having\r\nbeen _ex parte_,--he having employed Sir Elijah Impey to take affidavits\r\nagainst the women of high rank aforesaid, not only without any inquiry\r\nmade on their part, but without any communication to them of his\r\npractice and proceeding against them; and equity did at least require\r\nthat they, with his own knowledge and by the subordinates of his own\r\ngovernment, should be allowed a public inquiry to acquit themselves of\r\nthe heavy offences with which they had been by him clandestinely\r\ncharged.\r\n\r\nLXXVII. That he, the said Hastings, in order to effectually stifle the\r\nsaid inquiry, did enter on record a further minute, asserting that the\r\nsaid inquiry would be productive \"of evils greater than any which exist\r\nin the consequences which have already taken place, _and which time has\r\nalmost obliterated_\"; as also the following: \"If I am rightly informed,\r\nthe Nabob Vizier and the Begums are on terms of mutual goodwill. It\r\nwould ill become this government to interpose its influence by any act\r\nwhich might tend to revive their animosities,--and a very slight\r\noccasion would be sufficient to effect it. They will instantly take fire\r\non such a declaration, proclaim the judgment of the Company in their\r\nfavor, demand a reparation of the acts which they will construe wrongs\r\nwith such a sentence warranting that construction, and either accept the\r\ninvitation to the proclaimed scandal of the Nabob Vizier, which _will\r\nnot add to the credit of our government_, or remain in his dominions,\r\nbut not under his authority, to add to his vexations and the disorders\r\nof the country by continual intrigues and seditions. Enough already\r\nexists to affect his peace and the quiet of his people. If we cannot\r\nheal, let us not inflame the wounds _which have been inflicted_.\"--\"If\r\nthe Begums think themselves aggrieved to such a degree as to justify\r\nthem in _an appeal to a foreign jurisdiction_, to appeal to it against a\r\nman standing in the relation of son and grandson to them, _to appeal to\r\nthe justice of those who have been the abettors and instruments of their\r\nimputed wrongs_, let us at least permit them to be the judges of their\r\nown feelings, and prefer their complaints before we offer to redress\r\nthem. They will not need to be prompted. I hope I shall not depart from\r\nthe simplicity of official language in saying, the majesty of justice\r\nought to be approached with solicitation, not descend to provoke or\r\ninvite it, much less to debase itself by the suggestion of wrongs and\r\nthe promise of redress, with the denunciation of punishments before\r\ntrial, and even before accusation.\"\r\n\r\nLXXVIII. That the said Warren Hastings, in attempting to pass an act of\r\nindemnity for his own crimes, and of oblivion for the sufferings of\r\nothers, supposing the latter _almost obliterated_ by time, did not only\r\nmock and insult over the sufferings of the allies of the Company, but\r\ndid show an indecent contempt of the understandings of the Court of\r\nDirectors: because his violent attempts on the property and liberty of\r\nthe mother and grandmother of the ally aforesaid had not their first\r\ncommencement much above two years before that time, and had been\r\ncontinued, without abatement or relaxation on his part, to the very time\r\nof his minute; the Nabob having, by the instigation of his, the said\r\nHastings's, instrument, Hyder Beg Khân, not two months before the date\r\nof the Consultation, been obliged a second time to break his faith with\r\nrelation to the estates of his mother, in the manner hereinbefore\r\nrecited. And the said Hastings did not and could not conceive that the\r\nclearing the mother could revive any animosity between her and her son,\r\nby whom she never had been accused. The said Hastings was also sensible\r\nthat the restoration of her landed estates, recommended by the Court of\r\nDirectors, could not produce any ill effect on the mind of the said son,\r\nas it was \"with almost unconquerable reluctance he had been persuaded to\r\ndeprive her of them,\" and at the time of his submitting to become an\r\ninstrument in this injustice, did \"declare,\" both, to the Resident and\r\nhis ministers, \"that it was an act of compulsion.\"\r\n\r\nLXXIX. That the said Hastings further, by insinuating that the women in\r\nquestion would act amiss in appealing to _a foreign jurisdiction_\r\nagainst a son and grandson, could not forget that he himself, being that\r\nforeign jurisdiction, (if any jurisdiction there was,) did himself\r\ndirect and order the injuries, did himself urge the calumnies, and did\r\nhimself cause to be taken and produced the unsatisfactory evidence by\r\nwhich the women in question had suffered,--and that it was against him,\r\nthe said Hastings, and not against their son, that they had reason to\r\nappeal. But the truth is, that the inquiry was moved for by Mr. Stables,\r\nnot on the prayer or appeal of the sufferers, but upon the ill\r\nimpression which the said Hastings's own conduct, merely and solely on\r\nhis own state of it, and on his own evidence in support of it, had made\r\non the Court of Directors, who were his lawful masters, and not suitors\r\nin his court. And his arrogating to himself and his colleagues to be a\r\ntribunal, and a tribunal not for the purpose of doing justice, but of\r\nrefusing inquiry, was an high offence and misdemeanor (particularly as\r\nthe due obedience to the Company's orders was eluded on the insolent\r\npretence \"that the majesty of justice ought to be approached with\r\nsolicitation, and that it would debase itself by the suggestion of\r\nwrongs and the promise of redress\") in a Governor, whose business it is,\r\neven of himself, and unsolicited, not only to promise, but to afford,\r\nredress to all those who should suffer under the power of the Company,\r\neven if their ignorance, or want of protection, or the imbecility of\r\ntheir sex, or the fear of irritating persons in rank and station, should\r\nprevent them from seeking it by formal solicitation.\r\n\r\nLXXX. That the said Warren Hastings, at the time when he pretended\r\nignorance of all solicitation for justice on the part of the women\r\naforesaid, and on that pretence did refuse the inquiry moved by his\r\ncolleague, Mr. Stables, had in all probability received from the\r\nResident, Middleton, or, if he had made the slightest inquiry from the\r\nsaid Middleton, then at Calcutta, might immediately receive, an account\r\nthat _they did actually solicit_ the said Resident, through Major\r\nGilpin, for redress against his, the said Hastings's, calumnious\r\naccusation, and the false testimony by which it was supported, and did\r\nsend the said complaint to the Resident, Middleton, by the said Gilpin,\r\nto be transmitted to him, the said Hastings, and the Council, so early\r\nas the 19th of October, 1782; and that she, the mother of the Nabob,\r\ndid afterwards send the same to the Resident, Bristow, asserting their\r\ninnocence, and accompanying the same with the copies of letters (the\r\noriginals of which they asserted were in their hands) from the chief\r\nwitnesses against them, Hannay and Gordon, which letters did directly\r\noverturn the charges or insinuations in the affidavits made by them, and\r\nthat, instead of any accusation of an attempt upon them and their\r\nparties by the instigation of the mother of the Nabob, or by her\r\nministers, they, the said Hannay and Gordon, did attribute their\r\npreservation to them and to their services, and did, with strong\r\nexpressions of gratitude both to the mother of the Nabob and to her\r\nministers, fully acknowledge the same: which remonstrance of the mother\r\nof the Nabob, and the letters of the said Hannay and Gordon, are annexed\r\nto this charge; and the said Hastings is highly criminal for not having\r\nexamined into the facts alleged in the said remonstrance.\r\n\r\nLXXXI. That the violent proceedings of the said Warren Hastings did tend\r\nto impress all the neighboring princes, some of whom were allied in\r\nblood to the oppressed women of rank aforesaid, with an ill opinion of\r\nthe faith, honor, and decency of the British nation; and accordingly, on\r\nthe journey aforesaid made by the Nabob from Lucknow to Fyzabad, in\r\nwhich the said Nabob did restore, in the manner before mentioned, the\r\nconfiscated estates of his mother and grandmother, and did afterwards\r\nrevoke his said grant, it appears that the said journey did cause a\r\ngeneral alarm (the worst motives obtaining the most easy credit with\r\nregard to any future proceeding, on account of the foregone acts) and\r\nexcited great indignation among the ruling persons of the adjacent\r\ncountry, insomuch that Major Brown, agent to the said Warren Hastings at\r\nthe court of the King Shah Allum at Delhi, did write a remonstrance\r\ntherein to Mr. Bristow, Resident at Oude, as follows.\r\n\r\n\"The evening of the 7th, at a conference I had with Mirza Shaffee Khân,\r\nhe introduced a subject, respecting the Nabob Vizier, which, however it\r\nmay be disagreeable for you to know, and consequently for me to\r\ncommunicate, I am under a necessity of laying before you. He told me he\r\nhad received information from Lucknow, that, by the advice of Hyder Beg\r\nKhân, the Vizier had determined to bring his grandmother, the widow of\r\nSufdar Jung, from Fyzabad to Lucknow, with a view of getting a further\r\nsum of money from her, by seizing on her eunuchs, digging up the\r\napartments of her house at Fyzabad, and putting her own person under\r\nrestraint. This, he said, he knew was not an act of our government, but\r\nthe mere advice of Hyder Beg Khân, to which the Vizier had been induced\r\nto attend. He added, that the old Begum had resolved rather to put\r\nherself to death than submit to the disgrace intended to be put upon\r\nher; that, if such a circumstance should happen, there is _not a man in\r\nHindostan who will attribute the act to the Vizier [Nabob of Oude], but\r\nevery one will fix the odium on the English, who might easily, by the\r\ninfluence they so largely exercise in their own concerns there_, have\r\nprevented such unnatural conduct in the Vizier. He therefore called upon\r\nme, as the English representative in this quarter, to inform you of\r\nthis, that you may prevent a step which will destroy all confidence in\r\nthe English nation throughout Hindostan, and excite the bitterest\r\nresentment in all those who by blood are connected with the house of\r\nSufdar Jung. He concluded by saying, that, 'if the Vizier so little\r\nregarded his family and personal honor, or his natural duty, as to wish\r\nto disgrace his father's mother for a sum of money, let him plunder her\r\nof all she has, but let him send her safe up to Delhi or Agra, and, poor\r\nas I am, I will furnish subsistence for her, which she shall possess\r\nwith safety and honor, though it cannot be adequate to her rank.'\r\n\r\n\"This, Sir, is a most exact detail of the conversation (as far as\r\nrelated to that affair) on the part of Mirza Shaffee Khân. On my part I\r\ncould only say, that I imagined the affair was misrepresented, and that\r\nI should write as he requested. Let me therefore request that you will\r\nenable me to answer in a more effectual manner any further questions on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nLXXXII. \"As Mirza Shaffee's grandfather was brother to Sufdar Jung,\r\nthere can be no doubt of what his declaration means; and if this measure\r\nof dismissing the old Begum should be persisted in, I should not, from\r\nthe state of affairs, and the character of the Amir ul Omrah, be\r\nsurprised at some immediate and violent resolution being adopted by\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nLXXXIII. That Mirza Shaffee, mentioned in this correspondence, (who has\r\nsince been murdered,) was of near kindred to the lady in question,\r\n(grandmother to the Nabob,) was resident in a province immediately\r\nadjoining to the province of Oude, and, from proximity of situation and\r\nnearness of connection, was likely to have any intelligence concerning\r\nhis female relations from the best authority.\r\n\r\nLXXXIV. That the Resident, Bristow, on receiving this letter, did apply\r\nto the said Hyder Beg Khân for an explanation of the Nabob's intentions,\r\nwho denied that the Nabob intended more than a visit of duty and\r\nceremony: which, whatever his dispositions might have been, and probably\r\nwere, towards his own mother, was not altogether probable, as it was\r\nwell known that he was on very bad terms with the mother of his father,\r\nand it appears that intentions of a similar nature had been before\r\nmanifested even with regard to his own mother, and therefore obtained\r\nthe more easy credit concerning the other woman of high rank aforesaid,\r\nespecially as the evil designs of the said Hyder Beg were abundantly\r\nknown, and that the said Hastings, upon whom he did wholly depend,\r\ncontinued to recommend \"the most effectual, that is, the most violent,\r\nmeans for the recovery of the small remains of his extorted demand.\" But\r\nalthough it does not appear that the Resident did give credit to the\r\nsaid report, yet the effect of the same on the minds of the neighboring\r\nprinces did make it proper and necessary to direct a strict inquiry into\r\nthe same, which was not done; and it does not appear that any further\r\ninquiry was made into the true motives for this projected journey to\r\nFyzabad, nor into the proceedings of Hyder Beg Khân, although the said\r\nWarren Hastings well knew that all the acts of the Nabob and his\r\nprincipal ministers were constantly attributed to him, and that it was\r\nknown that secret agents, as well as the Company's regular agent, were\r\nemployed by him at Lucknow and other places.\r\n\r\nLXXXV. That the said Hastings, who did, on pretence of the majesty of\r\njustice, refuse to inquire into the charges made upon the female\r\nparents of the Nabob of Oude, in justification of the violence offered\r\nto them, did voluntarily and of his own accord make himself an accuser\r\nof the Resident, Middleton, for the want of a literal execution of his\r\norders in the plans of extortion and rapine aforesaid: the criminal\r\nnature, spirit, and tendency of the said proceedings, for the defective\r\nexecution of which he brought the said charge, appearing in the defence\r\nor apology made by Mr. Middleton, the Resident, for his temporary and\r\nshort forbearances.\r\n\r\nLXXXVI. \"It could not, I flatter myself, be termed a long or\r\nunwarrantable delay [two days], when the importance of the business, and\r\nthe peculiar embarrassments attending the prosecution of it to its\r\ndesired end, are considered. The Nabob was _son_ to the Begum whom we\r\nwere to proceed against: a son against a mother must at least _save\r\nappearances in his mode of proceeding_. The produce of his negotiation\r\nwas to be received by the Company. Receiving a benefit, accompanying the\r\nNabob, withdrawing their protection, were circumstances sufficient to\r\n_mark the English as the principal movers in this business_. At a court\r\nwhere no opportunity is lost to throw odium on us, so favorable an\r\noccasion was not missed to persuade the Nabob that we instigated him to\r\ndishonor his family for our benefit. The impressions made by these\r\nsuggestions constantly retarded the progress, and more than once\r\nactually broke off the business: which rendered the utmost caution on my\r\npart necessary, especially as I had no assistance to expect from the\r\nministers, who could not openly move in the business. In the East, it is\r\nwell known that no man either by himself or his troops, can enter the\r\nwalls of a zenanah, scarcely in the case of acting against an open\r\nenemy, much less of _an ally,--an ally acting against his own mother_.\r\nThe outer walls, and the Begum's agents, were all that were liable to\r\nimmediate attack: they were dealt with, and successfully, as the event\r\nproved.\"--He had before observed to Mr. Hastings, in his correspondence,\r\nwhat Mr. Hastings well knew to be true, \"that no farther rigor than that\r\nhe had exerted could be used against females in that country; where\r\nforce could be employed, it was not spared;--that the place of\r\nconcealment was only known to the chief eunuchs, who could not be drawn\r\nout of the women's apartments, where they had taken refuge, and from\r\nwhich, if an attempt had been made to storm them, they might escape; and\r\nthe secret of the money being known only to them, it was necessary to\r\nget their persons into his hands, which could be obtained by negotiation\r\nonly.\"--The Resident concluded his defence by declaring his \"hope, that,\r\nif the main object of his orders was fulfilled, he should be no longer\r\nheld criminal for a deviation from the precise letter of them.\"\r\n\r\nLXXXVII. That the said Warren Hastings did enter a reply to this answer,\r\nin support of his criminal charge, continuing to insist \"that his orders\r\nought to have been literally obeyed,\" although he did not deny that the\r\nabove difficulties occurred, and the above consequences must have been\r\nthe result,--and though the reports of the military officers charged\r\nwith the execution of his commission confirmed the moral impossibility,\r\nas well as inutility in point of profit, of forcing a son to greater\r\nviolence and rigor against his mother.\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII. That the said Hastings, after all the acts aforesaid, did\r\npresume to declare on record, in his minute of the 23d September, 1788,\r\n\"that, whatever may happen of the events which he dreads in the train of\r\naffairs now subsisting, he shall at least receive this consolation under\r\nthem, that he used his utmost exertions to prevent them, and that in the\r\nannals of the nations of India which have been subjected to the British\r\ndominions _HE shall not be remembered among their oppressors_.\" And\r\nspeaking of certain alleged indignities offered to the Nabob of Oude,\r\nand certain alleged suspicions of his authority with regard to the\r\nmanagement of his household, he, the said Hastings, did, in the said\r\nminute, endeavor to excite the spirit of the British nation, severely\r\nanimadverting on such offences, making use of the following terms: \"If\r\nthere be a spark of generous virtue in the breasts of any of my\r\ncountrymen who shall be the readers of this compilation, this letter\" (a\r\nletter of complaint from the Nabob) \"shall stand for an instrument to\r\nawaken it to the call of vengeance against so flagitious an abuse of\r\nauthority and reproach to the British name.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_From her Excellency the Bhow Begum to Mr. Bristow, Resident at the\r\nVizier's Court._\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity to write to you by way of information a detail of\r\nmy sufferings. From common report, and the intelligence of those who are\r\nabout you, the account of them will have reached your ears. I will here\r\nrelate a part of them.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Sujah Dowlah, most of his ungrateful servants were\r\nconstantly laboring to gratify their enmity; but finding, from the firm\r\nand sincere friendship which subsisted between me and the English, that\r\nthe accomplishment of their purposes was frustrated, they formed the\r\ndesign of occasioning a breach in that alliance, to insure their own\r\nsuccess. I must acquaint you that my son Asoph ul Dowlah had formerly\r\nthreatened to seize my jaghire; but, upon producing the treaty signed by\r\nyou, and showing it to Mr. Middleton, he interfered, and prevented the\r\nimpending evil. The conspiration now framed an accusation against me of\r\na conduct which I had never conceived even in idea, of rendering\r\nassistance to Rajah Cheyt Sing. The particulars are as follow. My son\r\nAsoph ul Dowlah and his ministers, with troops and a train of artillery,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Middleton, on the 16th of the month of Mohurum,\r\narrived at Fyzabad, and made a demand of a crore of rupees. As my\r\ninability to pay so vast a sum was manifest, I produced the treaty _you_\r\nsigned and gave me, but to no effect: their hearts were determined upon\r\nviolence. I offered my son Asoph ul Dowlah, whose will is dearer to me\r\nthan all my riches, or even life itself, whatever money and goods I was\r\npossessed of: but an amicable adjustment seemed not worth accepting: he\r\ndemanded the delivering up the fort, and the recall of the troops that\r\nwere stationed for the preserving the peace of the city. To me tumult\r\nand discord appeared unnecessary. I gave up these points, upon which\r\nthey seized my head eunuchs, Jewar Ali Khân and Behar Ali Khân, and sent\r\nthem to Mr. Middleton, after having obliged them to sign a bond for\r\nsixty lacs of rupees; they were thrown into prison, with fetters about\r\ntheir feet, and denied food and water. I, who had never, even in my\r\ndreams, experienced such an oppression, gave up all I had to preserve\r\nmy honor and dignity: but this would not satisfy their demands: they\r\ncharged me with a rupee and a half batta upon each mohur, and on this\r\naccount laid claims upon me to the amount of six lacs some thousand\r\nrupees, and sent Major Gilpin to exact the payment. Major Gilpin,\r\naccording to orders, at first was importunate; but being a man of\r\nexperience, and of a benevolent disposition, when he was convinced of my\r\nwant of means, he changed his conduct, and was willing to apply to the\r\nshroffs and bankers to lend me the money. But with the loss of my\r\njaghire my credit was sunk; I could not raise the sum. At last, feeling\r\nmy helpless situation, I collected my wardrobe and furniture, to the\r\namount of about three lacs of rupees, besides fifty thousand rupees\r\nwhich I borrowed from one place or other, and sent Major Gilpin with it\r\nto Lucknow. My sufferings did not terminate here. The disturbances of\r\nColonel Hannay and Mr. Gordon were made a pretence for seizing my\r\njaghire. The state of the matter is this. When Colonel Hannay was by Mr.\r\nHastings ordered to march to Benares, during the troubles of Cheyt Sing,\r\nthe Colonel, _who had plundered the whole country, was incapable of\r\nproceeding, from the union of thousands of zemindars, who had seized\r\nthis favorable opportunity_: they harassed Mr. Gordon near Junivard\r\n[Juanpore?], and the zemindars of that place and Acberpore opposed his\r\nmarch from thence, till he arrived near Taunda. As the Taunda nullah,\r\nfrom its overflowing, was difficult to cross without a boat, Mr. Gordon\r\nsent to the Phousdar to supply him. He replied, the boats were all in\r\nthe river, but would, according to orders, assist him as soon as\r\npossible. Mr. Gordon's situation would not admit of his waiting: he\r\nforded the nullah upon his elephant, and was hospitably entertained and\r\nprotected by the Phousdar for six days. In the mean time a letter was\r\nreceived by me from Colonel Hannay, desiring me to escort Mr. Gordon to\r\nFyzabad. As my friendship for the English was always sincere, I readily\r\ncomplied, and sent some companies of nejeebs to escort Mr. Gordon, and\r\nall his effects, to Fyzabad, where, having provided for his\r\nentertainment, I effected his junction with Colonel Hannay. The letters\r\nof thanks I received from both these gentlemen upon this occasion are\r\nstill in my possession, copies of which I gave in charge to Major\r\nGilpin, to be delivered to Mr. Middleton, that he might forward them to\r\nthe Governor-General. To be brief, those who have loaded me with\r\naccusations are now clearly convicted of falsehood. But is it not\r\nextraordinary, notwithstanding the justness of my cause, that nobody\r\nrelieves my misfortunes? Why did Major Gilpin return without effect?\r\n\r\nMy prayers have been constantly offered to Heaven for your arrival;\r\nreport has announced it; for which reason I have taken up the pen, and\r\nrequest you will not place implicit confidence in my accusers, but,\r\nweighing in the scale of justice their falsehoods and my\r\nrepresentations, you will exert your influence in putting a period to\r\nthe misfortunes with which I am overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Copy of a Letter from Colonel Hannay to Jewar Ali Khân and Behar Ali\r\nKhân._\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure to receive your friendly letter, fraught with\r\nbenevolence; and whatever favors you, my friends, have been pleased to\r\nconfer respecting Mr. Gordon afforded me the greatest pleasure.\r\n\r\nPlacing a firm reliance on your friendship, I am in expectation that the\r\naforesaid gentleman, with his baggage, will arrive at Fyzabad in safety,\r\nthat the same may oblige and afford satisfaction to me.\r\n\r\nA letter from Mr. Gordon is inclosed to you. I am in expectation of its\r\nbeing inclosed in a cover to the Aumil of Taunda, to the end that the\r\nAumil may forward it to the above-mentioned gentleman, and procure his\r\nreply. Whenever the answer arrives, let it be delivered to Hoolas Roy,\r\nwho will forward it to me.\r\n\r\nAlways rejoice me by a few lines respecting your health. [Continue to\r\nhonor me with your correspondence.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Copy of a Letter from Colonel Hannay to Jewar and Behar Ali Khân._\r\n\r\nKhân Saib, my indulgent friends, remain under the protection of God!\r\n\r\nYour friendly letter, fraught with kindness, accompanied by an honorary\r\nletter from the Begum Saib, of exalted dignity, and inclosing a letter\r\nfrom Mr. Gordon, sent through your hircarrahs, obliged and rejoiced me.\r\n\r\nWith respect to what you communicate regarding your not having received\r\nan answer to your friendly epistle, I became perfectly astonished, as a\r\nreply was written from Mohadree. It may be owing to the danger of the\r\nroad that it never arrived,--not to the smallest neglect on my side [or\r\nof mine].\r\n\r\nI now send two letters to you,--one by the Dawk people, and the second\r\nby one of my hircarrahs, (who will present them to you,) which you\r\ncertainly will receive.\r\n\r\nI am extremely well contented and pleased with the friendship you have\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nYou wrote me to remain perfectly easy concerning Mr. Gordon. Verily,\r\nfrom the kindness of you, my indulgent friends, my heart is quite easy.\r\nYou also observed and mentioned, that, as Mr. Gordon's coming with those\r\nattached to him [probably his sepoys and others] might be attended with\r\ndifficulty, if I approved, he should be invited alone to Fyzabad. My\r\nfriends, I place my expectation entirely upon your friendships, and\r\nleave it to you to adopt the manner in which the said gentleman may\r\narrive in security, without molestation, at Fyzabad; but at the same\r\ntime let the plan be so managed that it may not come to the knowledge of\r\nany zemindars: in this case you are men of discernment. However, he is\r\nto come to Fyzabad: extend your assistance and endeavors.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Begum Saib, of high dignity, has received\r\nauthentic intelligence from the camp at Benares. Favor me with the\r\ncontents or purport.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Gordon's letter I understand that Mirza Imaum Buksh, whom you\r\ndispatched thither [Taunda], has and still continues to pay great\r\nattention to that gentleman, which affords me great pleasure.\r\n\r\nAn answer to the Begum's letter is to be presented. I also send a letter\r\nfor Mr. Gordon, which please to forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Address from Colonel Hannay to the Begum._\r\n\r\nBegum Saib, of exalted dignity and generosity, &c., whom God preserve!\r\n\r\nYour exalting letter, fraught with grace and benevolence, that through\r\nyour unbounded generosity and goodness was sent through grace and favor,\r\nI had the honor to receive in a fortunate moment, and whatever you were\r\npleased to write respecting Mr. Gordon,--\"that, as at this time the\r\nshort-sighted and deluded ryots had carried their disturbances and\r\nravages beyond all bounds, Mr. Gordon's coming with his whole people [or\r\nadherents] might be attended with difficulty, and therefore, if I chose,\r\nhe should be invited to come alone.\" Now, as your Highness is the best\r\njudge, your faithful servant reposeth his most unbounded hopes and\r\nexpectation upon your Highness, that the aforesaid Mr. Gordon may arrive\r\nat Fyzabad without any apprehension or danger. I shall be then extremely\r\nhonored and obliged.\r\n\r\nConsidering me in the light of a firm and faithful servant, continue to\r\nhonor and exalt me by your letters.\r\n\r\nWhat further can I say?\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Copy of an Address from Mr. Gordon to the Begum._\r\n\r\nBegum Saib, of exalted dignity and generosity, whom God preserve!\r\n\r\nAfter presenting the usual professions of servitude, &c., in the\r\ncustomary manner, my address is presented.\r\n\r\nYour gracious letter, in answer to the petition of your servant from\r\nGoondah, exalted me.

I hope from your friendship, until we meet, you\r\nwill continue to honor me with an account of your health and welfare.\r\nWhat further can I write?\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--REVOLUTIONS IN FURRUCKABAD.\r\n\r\nI. That a prince called Ahmed Khân was of a family amongst the most\r\ndistinguished in Hindostan, and of a nation famous through that empire\r\nfor its valor in acquiring, and its policy and prudence in well\r\ngoverning the territories it had acquired, called the Patans, or\r\nAfghans, of which the Rohillas were a branch. The said Ahmed Khân had\r\nfixed his residence in the city of Furruckabad, and in the first wars\r\nof this nation in India the said Ahmed Khân attached himself to the\r\nCompany against Sujah Dowlah, then an enemy, now a dependant on that\r\nCompany. Ahmed Khân, towards the close of his life, was dispossessed of\r\na large part of his dominions by the prevalence of the Mahratta power;\r\nbut his son, a minor, succeeded to his pretensions, and to the remainder\r\nof his dominions. The Mahrattas were expelled by Sujah ul Dowlah, the\r\nlate Vizier, who, finding a want of the services of the son and\r\nsuccessor of Ahmed Khân, called Muzuffer Jung, did not only guaranty him\r\nin the possession of what he then actually held, but engaged to restore\r\nall the other territories which had been occupied by the Mahrattas; and\r\nthis was confirmed by repeated treaties and solemn oaths, by the late\r\nVizier and by the present. But neither the late nor the present Vizier\r\nfulfilled their engagements, or observed their oaths: the former having\r\nwithheld what he had stipulated to restore; and the latter not only\r\nsubjecting him to a tribute, instead of restoring him to what his father\r\nhad unjustly withheld, but having made a further invasion by depriving\r\nhim of fifteen of his districts, levying the tribute of the whole on the\r\nlittle that remained, and putting the small remains of his territory\r\nunder a sequestrator or collector appointed by Almas Ali Khân, who did\r\ngrievously afflict and oppress the prince and territory aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThat the hardships of his case being frequently represented to Warren\r\nHastings, Esquire, he did suggest a doubt whether \"that little ought to\r\nbe still subject to tribute,\" indicating that the said tribute might be\r\nhard and inequitable,--but, whatever its justice might have been, that,\r\n\"from the _earliest period_ of our connection with the present Nabob of\r\nOude, it had invariably continued a part of the funds assigned by his\r\nExcellency as a provision for the liquidation of the several public\r\ndemands of _this government_ [Calcutta] upon him; and in consequence of\r\nthe powers the board deemed it expedient to vest in the Resident at his\r\ncourt for the collection of the Company's assignments, a _sezauwil_ [a\r\nsequestrator] has always been stationed to enforce by every means in his\r\npower the payment of the tribute.\" And the said tribute was, in\r\nconsequence of this arrangement, not paid to the Nabob, but to the\r\nBritish Resident at Oude; and the same being therefore under the\r\ndirection and for the sole use of the Company, and indeed the prince\r\nhimself wholly dependent, the representatives of the said Company were\r\nresponsible for the protection of the prince, and for the good\r\ngovernment of the country.\r\n\r\nII. That the said \"Warren Hastings did, on the 22d of May, 1780,\r\nrepresent to the board of Calcutta the condition of the said country in\r\nthe following manner.\r\n\r\n\"To the total want of all order, regularity, or _authority_ in his\r\ngovernment [the Furruckabad government], among _other obvious causes_,\r\nit may, no doubt, be owing, that the country of Furruckabad is become\r\n_an almost entire waste, without cultivation or inhabitants_; that the\r\ncapital, which but a very short time ago was distinguished as one of the\r\nmost _populous and opulent_ commercial cities in Hindostan, at present\r\nexhibits nothing _but_ scenes of the most wretched poverty, desolation,\r\nand misery; and the Nabob himself, though in possession of a tract of\r\ncountry which with only common care is notoriously capable of yielding\r\nan annual revenue of between thirty and forty lacs [three or four\r\nhundred thousand pounds], with _no military establishment to maintain,\r\nscarcely commanding the means of bare subsistence_.\" And the said Warren\r\nHastings, taking into consideration the said state of the country and\r\nits prince, and that the latter had \"_preferred frequent complaints_\"\r\n(which complaints the said Hastings to that time did not lay before the\r\nboard, as his duty required) \"_of the hardships and indignities_ to\r\nwhich he is subjected by the conduct of the sezauwil [sequestrator]\r\nstationed in the country for the purpose of levying the annual tribute\r\nwhich he is bound by treaty to pay to the Subah of Oude,\" he, the said\r\nWarren Hastings, did declare himself \"extremely desirous, as well from\r\nmotives of _common justice_ as _due_ regard to _the rank which that\r\nchief holds among the princes of Hindostan_, of affording him relief.\"\r\nAnd he, the said Warren Hastings, as the means of the said relief, did,\r\nwith the consent of the board, order the said native sequestrator to be\r\nremoved, and an English Resident, a servant of the Company, to be\r\nappointed in his room, declaring \"he understood a local interference to\r\nbe _indispensably necessary_ for realizing the Vizier's just demands.\"\r\n\r\nIII. That the said native sequestrator being withdrawn, and a Resident\r\nappointed, no complaint whatever concerning the collection of the\r\nrevenue, or of any indignities offered to the prince of the country or\r\noppression of his subjects by the said Resident, was made to the\r\nSuperior Council at Calcutta; yet the said Warren Hastings did,\r\nnevertheless, in a certain paper, purporting to be a treaty made at\r\nChunar with the Nabob of Oude, on the 19th September, 1781, at the\r\nrequest of the said Nabob, consent to an article therein, \"That no\r\nEnglish Resident be appointed to Furruckabad, and that the present be\r\nrecalled.\" And the said Warren Hastings, knowing that the Nabob of Oude\r\nwas ill-affected towards the said Nabob of Furruckabad, and that he was\r\nalready supposed to have oppressed him, did justify his conduct on the\r\nprinciples and in the words following: \"That, if the Nabob Muzuffer Jung\r\n_must_ endure oppression, (_and I dare not at this time propose his\r\ntotal relief_,) it concerns the reputation of our government to remove\r\n_our participation in it_.\" And the said Warren Hastings making,\r\nrecording, and acting upon the first of the said false and inhuman\r\nsuppositions, most scandalous to this nation, namely, that princes\r\npaying money wholly for the use of the Company, and directly to its\r\nagent, for the maintenance of British troops, by whose force and power\r\nthe said revenue was in effect collected, must of necessity endure\r\noppression, and that our government at any time _dare_ not propose their\r\n_total_ relief, was an high offence and misdemeanor in the said Warren\r\nHastings, and the rather, because in the said treaty, as well as before\r\nand after, the said Hastings, who pretended not to dare to relieve those\r\noppressed by the Nabob of Oude, did assume a complete authority over the\r\nsaid Nabob himself, and did dare to oppress him.\r\n\r\nIV. That the second principle assumed by the said Warren Hastings, as\r\nground for voluntarily abandoning the protection of those whom he had\r\nbefore undertaken to relieve, _on the sole strength of his own\r\nauthority_, and in full confidence of the lawful foundation thereof, and\r\nfor delivering over the persons so taken into protection, under false\r\nnames and pretended descriptions, to known oppression, asserting that\r\nthe reputation of the Company was saved by removing this apparent\r\nparticipation, when the new as well as the old arrangements were truly\r\nand substantially acts of the British government, was disingenuous,\r\ndeceitful, and used to cover unjustifiable designs: since the said\r\nWarren Hastings well knew that all oppressions exercised by the Nabob of\r\nOude were solely, and in this instance particularly, upheld by British\r\nforce, and were imputed to this nation; and because he himself, in not\r\nmore than three days after the execution of this treaty, and in virtue\r\nthereof, did direct the British Resident at Oude, in orders _to which he\r\nrequired his most implicit obedience_, \"that the ministers [the Nabob of\r\nOude's ministers] are to choose _all_ aumils and collectors of revenue\r\nwith your concurrence.\" And the dishonor to the Company, in thus\r\ndeceitfully concurring in oppression, which they were able and were\r\nbound to prevent, is much aggravated by the said Warren Hastings's\r\nreceiving from the person to whose oppression he had delivered the said\r\nprince, as a private gift or donation to himself and for his own use, a\r\nsum of money amounting to one hundred thousand pounds and upwards, which\r\nmight give just ground of suspicion that the said gift from the\r\noppressor to the person surrendering the person injured to his mercy\r\nmight have had some share in the said criminal transaction.\r\n\r\nV. That the said Warren Hastings did (in the paper justifying the said\r\nsurrender of the prince put by himself under the protection of the East\r\nIndia Company) assert, \"that it was a fact, that the Nabob Muzuffer\r\nJung [the Nabob of Furruckabad] is equally urgent with the Nabob Vizier\r\nfor the removal of a Resident,\" without producing, as he ought to have\r\ndone, any document to prove his improbable assertion, namely, his\r\nassertion that the oppressed prince did apply to his known enemy and\r\noppressor, the Nabob of Oude, (who, if he would, was not able to relieve\r\nhim against the will of the English government,) rather than to that\r\nEnglish government, which he must have conceived to be more impartial,\r\nto which he had made his former complaint, and which was alone able to\r\nrelieve him.\r\n\r\nVI. That the said Warren Hastings, in the said writing, did further\r\nconvey an insinuation of an ambiguous, but, on any construction, of a\r\nsuspicious and dangerous import, viz.: \"It is a fact, that Mr. Shee's\r\n[the Resident's] authority over the territory of Furruckabad is in\r\nitself as much subversive of that [_of the lawful rulers_] as that of\r\nthe Vizier's aumil [collector] ever was, and is the more _oppressive_ as\r\nthe power from whence it is derived is greater.\" The said assertion\r\nproceeds upon a supposition of the illegality both of the Nabob's and\r\nthe Company's government; all consideration of the _title_ to authority\r\nbeing, therefore, on that supposition, put out of the question, and the\r\nwhole turning only upon the _exercise_ of authority, the said Hastings's\r\nsuggestion, that the oppression of government must be in proportion to\r\nits power, is the result of a false and dangerous principle, and such as\r\nit is criminal for any person intrusted with the lives and fortunes of\r\nmen to entertain, much more, publicly to profess as a rule of action, as\r\nthe same hath a direct tendency to make the new and powerful government\r\nof this kingdom in India dreadful to the natives and odious to the\r\nworld. But if the said Warren Hastings did mean thereby indirectly to\r\ninsinuate that oppressions had been actually exercised under the British\r\nauthority, he was bound to inquire into these oppressions, and to\r\nanimadvert on the person guilty of the same, if proof thereof could be\r\nhad,--and the more, as the authority was given by _himself_, and the\r\nperson exercising it was by himself also named. And the said Warren\r\nHastings did on another occasion assert that \"whether they were well or\r\nill-founded he never had an opportunity to ascertain.\" But it is not\r\ntrue that the said Hastings did or could want such opportunity: the fact\r\nbeing, that the said Warren Hastings did never cause any inquiry to be\r\nmade into any supposed abuses during the said Residency, but did give a\r\npension of fifteen hundred pounds a year to the said late Resident as a\r\ncompensation to him for an injury received, and did afterwards promote\r\nthe Resident, as a faithful servant of the Company, (and nothing appears\r\nto show him otherwise,) to a judicial office of high trust,--thereby\r\ntaking away all credit from any grounds asserted or insinuated by the\r\nsaid Hastings for delivering the said Nabob of Furruckabad to the hand\r\nof a known enemy and oppressor, who had already, contrary to repeated\r\ntreaties, deprived him of a large part of his territories.\r\n\r\nVII. That, on the said Warren Hastings's representation of the\r\ntransaction aforesaid to the Court of Directors, they did heavily and\r\njustly censure the said Warren Hastings for the same, and did convey\r\ntheir censure to him, recommending relief to the suffering prince, but\r\nwithout any order for sending a new Resident: being, as it may be\r\nsupposed, prevented from taking that step by the faith of the treaty\r\nmade at Chunar.\r\n\r\nVIII. That all the oppressions foreseen by him, the said Warren\r\nHastings, when he made the article aforesaid in the treaty of Chunar,\r\ndid actually happen: for, immediately on the removal of the British\r\nResident, the country of Furruckabad was subjected to the discretion of\r\na certain native manager of revenue, called Almas Ali Khân, who did\r\nimpoverish and oppress the country and insult the prince, and did\r\ndeprive him of all subsistence from his own estates,--taking from him\r\neven his gardens and the tombs of his ancestors, and the funds for\r\nmaintaining the same.\r\n\r\nIX. That, on complaint of those proceedings, the said Hastings did of\r\nhis own authority, and without communicating with his Council, direct\r\nthe native collector aforesaid to be removed, and the territory of\r\nFurruckabad to be left to the sole management of its natural prince. But\r\nin a short time the said Hastings, pretending to receive many complaints\r\npurporting that the tribute to the Nabob remained wholly unpaid, and the\r\nagent to the prince of Furruckabad at the Presidency, and afterwards\r\nchief manager to the prince aforesaid, having, as the said Warren\r\nHastings saith, \"had the insolence to propagate a report that the\r\n_interference_ to which his master owed the power he then enjoyed was\r\n_purchased_ through him,\" he, the said Hastings, did again (but, as\r\nbefore, without the Council) \"withdraw his protection and interference\r\naltogether,\" on or about the month of August, 1782, and did signify his\r\nresolution, through the Resident, Middleton, to the Nabob Vizier. But\r\nthe said Hastings asserts that \"the consequence of this his own second\r\ndereliction of the prince of Furruckabad was _an aggravated renewal of\r\nthe severities_ exercised against his government, and the reappointment\r\nof a sezauwil, with powers delegated or assumed, to the _utter\r\nextinction_ of the rights of Muzuffer Jung, and actually depriving him\r\nof the means of subsistence.\" And the said Hastings did receive, on the\r\n16th of February, 1783, from the prince aforesaid, a bitter complaint of\r\nthe same to the following tenor.\r\n\r\n\"The miseries which have fallen upon my country, and the poverty and\r\ndistress which have been heaped upon me by the reappointment of the\r\nsezauwil, are such, that a relation of them would, I am convinced,\r\nexcite the strongest feelings of compassion in your breast. But it is\r\nimpossible to relate them: on one side, my country ruined and\r\nuncultivated to a degree of desolation which exceeds all description; on\r\nthe other, my domestic concerns and connections involved _in such a\r\nstate of distress and horror, that even the relations, the children, and\r\nthe wives of my father are starving in want of daily bread, and are on\r\nthe point of flying voluntary exiles from their country and from each\r\nother_.\"\r\n\r\nBut although the said Hastings did, on the 16th of February, receive and\r\nadmit the justice of the said complaint, and did not deny the urgent\r\nnecessity of redress, the said letter containing the following sentence,\r\n\"If there should be _any delay_ in your acceptance of this proposal, _my\r\nexistence and the existence of my family will become difficult and\r\ndoubtful_,\"--and although he did admit the interference to be the more\r\nurgently demanded, \"as the services of the English troops have been\r\nadded to enforce the authority of the sezauwil,\"--and although he admits\r\nalso, that, even before that time, similar complaints and applications\r\nhad been made,--yet he did withhold the said letter of complaint, a\r\nminute of which he asserts he had, at or about that time, prepared for\r\nthe relief of the sufferer, from the Board of Council, and did not so\r\nmuch as propose anything relative to the same for seven months after,\r\nviz., until the 6th of October, 1783: the said letter and minute being,\r\nas he asserts, \"_withheld_, from causes _not necessary to mention_, from\r\npresentation.\" By which means the said country and prince did suffer a\r\nlong continuance of unnecessary hardship, from which the said Hastings\r\nconfessed it was his duty to relieve them, and that a British Resident\r\nwas necessary at Furruckabad, \"from a sense of submission to the\r\n_implied_ orders of the Court of Directors in their letter of 1783,\r\nlately received, added to _the conviction I have LONG SINCE_ entertained\r\n_of the necessity of such an appointment for the preservation of our\r\nnational credit_, and the means of rescuing an ancient and respectable\r\nfamily from ruin.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the said Warren Hastings did at length perform what he thought had\r\n_long since_ been necessary; and in contradiction to his engagements\r\nwith the Nabob in the treaty of Chunar, and against his strong\r\nremonstrances, urging his humiliation from this measure, and the faith\r\nof the agreement, and against his own former declaration that it\r\nconcerned the reputation of our government to remove our participation\r\nin the oppressions which he, the said Hastings, supposed the prince of\r\nFurruckabad must undergo, did once more recommend to the Council a\r\nBritish Resident at Furruckabad, and the withdrawing the native\r\nsezauwil: no course being left to the said Hastings to take which was\r\nnot a violation of some engagement, and a contradiction to some\r\nprinciple of justice and policy by him deliberately advanced and entered\r\non record.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Willes being appointed Resident, and having arrived at\r\nFurruckabad on the 25th of February, 1784, with instructions to inquire\r\nminutely into the state of the country and the ruling family, he, the\r\nsaid Resident, Willes, in obedience thereto, did fully explain to him,\r\nthe Governor-General, the said Warren Hastings, (he being then out of\r\nthe Company's provinces, at Lucknow, on a delegation which respected\r\nthis very country, as part of the dependencies of Oude,) the situation\r\nof the province of Furruckabad; but the said Warren Hastings did not\r\ntake or recommend any measure whatsoever for the relief thereof in\r\nconsequence of the said representation, nor even communicate to the\r\nCouncil-General the said representation; and it was not until the 28th\r\nof June, 1783 [1785?], that is, sixteen months from the arrival of the\r\nResident at his station, that anything was laid before the board\r\nrelative to the regulation or relief of the distressed country\r\naforesaid, and that not from the said Warren Hastings, but from other\r\nmembers of the Council: which purposed neglect of duty, joined to the\r\npreceding wilful delay of seven months in proposing the said relief\r\noriginally, caused near two years' delay. And the said Warren Hastings\r\nis further culpable in not communicating to the Council Board the order\r\nwhich he had, of his own authority, and without any powers from them,\r\ngiven to the said Resident, Willes, and did thereby prevent them from\r\ntaking such steps as might counteract the ill effects of the said order;\r\nwhich order purported, that the said Willes was not to interfere with\r\nthe Nabob of Furruckabad's government, for the regulation of which he\r\nwas in effect appointed to the Residency,--declaring as follows: \"I rely\r\nmuch on your moderation and good judgment, which I hope will enable you\r\nto regulate your conduct towards the Nabob and his _servants_ in such a\r\nmanner, that, _without interfering in the executive part of his\r\ngovernment_, you may render him essential service by _your council and\r\nadvice_.\" And this restriction the said Hastings did impose, which\r\ntotally frustrated the purpose of the Resident's mission, though he well\r\nknew, and had frequently stated, the extreme imbecility and weakness of\r\nthe said Nabob of Furruckabad, and his subjection to unworthy servants;\r\nand in the Minute of Consultation upon which he founded the appointment\r\ndid state the Nabob of Furruckabad \"as a weak and unexperienced young\r\nman, who had abandoned himself entirely to the discretion of his\r\nservants, and the restoration of his independence was followed by a\r\n_total_ breach of the engagements he had promised to fulfil, attended by\r\npointed instances of contumacy and disrespect\"; and in the said minute\r\nthe said Hastings adds, (as before mentioned,) his principal servant and\r\nmanager had propagated a report that the \"_interference_\" (namely, his,\r\nthe said Hastings's, interference) \"to which his master owed the power\r\nhe then enjoyed was purchased by him,\" the principal servant aforesaid:\r\nyet he, the said Hastings, who had assigned on record the character of\r\nthe said Nabob, and the conduct of his servants, and the aforesaid\r\nreport of his principal servant, so highly dishonorable to him, the said\r\nHastings, as reasons for taking away the independency of the Nabob of\r\nFurruckabad, and the subjecting him to the oppression of the Nabob of\r\nOude's officer, Almas Ali, did again himself establish the pretended\r\nindependence of the said prince of Furruckabad, and the real\r\nindependence of his corrupt and perfidious servants, not against the\r\nNabob of Oude, but against a British Resident appointed by himself (\"as\r\na character eminently qualified for such a charge\") for the correction\r\nof those evils, and for rendering the prince aforesaid an useful ally to\r\nthe Company, and restoring his dominions to order and plenty.\r\n\r\nThat the said Hastings did not only disable the Resident at Furruckabad\r\nby his said prohibitory letter, but did render his very remaining at all\r\nin that station perfectly precarious by a subsequent letter, rendering\r\nhim liable to dismission by the Vizier,--thereby changing the tenure of\r\nthe Resident's office, and changing him from a minister of the Company,\r\ndependent on the Governor-General and Council, to a dependant upon an\r\nunresponsible power,--in this also acting without the Council, and by\r\nhis own usurped authority: and accordingly the said Resident did\r\ndeclare, in his letter of the 24th of April, 1785, \"that the situation\r\nof the country was _more_ distressful than when he [the prince of\r\nFurruckabad] addressed himself for relief in 1783, and that he was sorry\r\nto say that his appointment at Furruckabad was of no use\"; that, though\r\nthe old tribute could not be paid, owing to famine and other causes, it\r\nwas increased by a new imposition, making the whole equal the entire\r\n_gross_ produce of the revenue; that therefore there will not be\r\n\"_anything for the subsistence of the Nabob and family_.\" And the uncles\r\nof the said Nabob of Furruckabad, the brethren of the late Ahmed Khân,\r\n(who had rendered important services to the Company,) and their\r\nchildren, in a petition to the Resident, represented that soon after the\r\nsuccession of Muzuffer Jung \"their misery commenced. The jaghires [lands\r\nand estates] on which they subsisted were disallowed. Our distress is\r\ngreat: we have neither clothes nor food. Though we felt hurt at the idea\r\nof explaining our situation, yet, could we have found a mode of\r\nconveyance, we would have proceeded to Calcutta for redress. The\r\nscarcity of grain this season is an additional misfortune. With\r\ndifficulty we support life. From your presence without the provinces we\r\nexpect relief. It is not the custom of the Company to deprive the\r\nzemindars and jaghiredars of the means of subsistence. To your justice\r\nwe look up.\"\r\n\r\nThis being the situation of the person and family of the Nabob of\r\nFurruckabad and his nearest relations, the state of the country and its\r\ncapital, prevented from all relief by the said Warren Hastings, is\r\ndescribed in the following words by the Resident, Willes.\r\n\r\n\"Almas Ali has taken the purgunnah of Marara at a very inadequate rent,\r\nand his aumils have seized many adjacent villages: the purgunnahs of\r\nCocutmow and Souje are constantly plundered by his people. The\r\ncollection of the ghauts near Futtyghur has been seized by the Vizier's\r\n_cutwal_, and the zemindars in four purgunnahs are so refractory as to\r\nhave fortified themselves in their gurries, and to refuse all payments\r\nof revenue. This is the state of the purgunnahs. _And Furruckabad,\r\nwhich was once the seat of great opulence and trade, is now daily\r\ndeserted by its inhabitants, its walls mouldering away, without police,\r\nwithout protection, exposed to the depredations of a banditti of two or\r\nthree hundred robbers, who, night after night, enter it for plunder,\r\nmurdering all who oppose them. The ruin that has overtaken this country\r\nis not to be wondered at, when it is considered that there has been no\r\nstate, no stable government, for many years._ There has been the Nabob\r\nVizier's authority, his ministers', the Residents' at Lucknow, the\r\nsezauwils', the camp authority, the Nabob Muzuffer Jung's, and that of\r\ntwenty duans or advisers: no authority sufficiently predominant to\r\nestablish any regulations for the benefit of the country, whilst each\r\nauthority has been exerted, as opportunity offered, for temporary\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\"Such being the present _deplorable_ state of Furruckabad and its\r\ndistricts, in the ensuing year it will be in vain to look for revenue,\r\nif some regulations equal to the exigency be not adopted. The whole\r\ncountry will be divided between the neighboring powerful aumils, the\r\nrefractory zemindars, and banditti of robbers; and the Patans, who might\r\nbe made useful subjects, will fly from the scene of anarchy. The crisis\r\nappears now come, that either some plan of government should be resolved\r\non, so as to form faithful subjects on the frontier, or the country be\r\ngiven up to its fate: and if it be abandoned, there can be little doubt\r\nbut that the Mahrattas will gladly seize on a station so favorable to\r\nincursions into the Vizier's dominions, will attach to their interests\r\nthe Hindoo zemindars, and possess themselves of forts, which, with\r\nlittle expense being made formidable, would give employment perhaps to\r\nthe whole of our force, should it be ever necessary to recover them.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Council at Calcutta, on the representation aforesaid made by\r\nthe Resident at Furruckabad, did propose and record a plan for the\r\nbetter government of the said country, but did delay the execution of\r\nthe same until the arrangements made by the said Hastings with the Nabob\r\nVizier should be known; but the said Hastings, as far as in him lay, did\r\nentirely set aside any plan that could be formed for that purpose upon\r\nthe basis of a British Resident at Furruckabad, by engaging with the\r\nsaid Nabob Vizier that no British influence shall be employed within his\r\ndominions, and he has engaged to that prince not to abandon him to any\r\nother mode of relation; and he has informed the Court of Directors that\r\nthe territories of the Nabob of Oude will be ruined, if Residents are\r\nsent into them, observing, that \"Residents never will be sent for any\r\nother purposes than those of vengeance and corruption.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings did declare to the Court of Directors,\r\nthat in his opinion the mode of relief most effectual, and most lenient\r\nwith regard to Furruckabad, would be to nominate one of the family of\r\nthe prince to superintend his affairs and to secure the payments; but\r\nthis plan, which appears to be most connected with the rights of the\r\nruling family, whilst it provides against the imbecility of the natural\r\nlord, and is free from his objection to a Resident, is the only one\r\nwhich the said Hastings never has executed, or even proposed to execute.\r\n\r\nThat the said Hastings, by the agreements aforesaid, has left the\r\nCompany in such an alternative, that they can neither relieve the said\r\nprince of Furruckabad from oppression without a breach of the\r\nengagements entered into by him, the said Hastings, with the Nabob\r\nVizier in the name of the Company, nor suffer him to remain under the\r\nsaid oppression without violating all faith and all the rules of justice\r\nwith regard to him. And the said Hastings hath directly made or\r\nauthorized no less than six revolutions in less than five years in the\r\naforesaid harassed province; by which frequent and rapid changes of\r\ngovernment, all of them made in contradiction to all his own declared\r\nmotives and reasons for the several acts successively done and undone in\r\nthis transaction, the distresses of the country and the disorders in its\r\nadministration have been highly aggravated; and in the said irregular\r\nproceedings, and in the gross and complicated violations of faith with\r\nall parties, the said Hastings is guilty of high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--DESTRUCTION OF THE RAJAH OF SAHLONE.\r\n\r\nI. That the late Nabob of Oude, Sujah ul Dowlah, did (on what reasons of\r\npolicy or pretences of justice is unknown) dispossess a certain native\r\nperson of distinction, or eminent Rajah, residing in the country of\r\nSahlone, \"the lineal descendant of the most powerful Hindoo family in\r\nthat part of Hindostan,\" of his patrimonial estate, and conferred the\r\nsame, or part of the same, on his, the Nabob's, mother, as a jaghire, or\r\nestate, for the term of her life: and the mother of the Nabob, in order\r\nto quiet the country, and to satisfy in some measure the principal and\r\nother inhabitants, did allow and pay a certain pension to the said\r\nRajah; which pension, on the general confiscation of jaghires, made at\r\nthe instigation of the said Warren Hastings, and by the letting the\r\nlands so confiscated to farmers at rack-rents, was discontinued and\r\nrefused to be paid; and the discontinuance of the said pension, \"on\r\naccount of the personal respect borne to the Rajah, (as connections with\r\nhim are sought for, and thought _to confer honor_,)\" did cause an\r\nuniversal discontent and violent commotions in the district of Sahlone,\r\nand other parts of the province of Oude, with great consequent effusion\r\nof blood, and interruption, if not total discontinuance, to the\r\ncollection of the revenues in those parts, other than as the same was\r\nirregularly, and with great damage to the country, enforced by British\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nII. That Mr. Lumsdaine, the officer employed to reduce those disordered\r\nparts of the province to submission, after several advantages gained\r\nover the Rajah and his adherents, and expelling him from the country,\r\ndid represent the utter impossibility of bringing it to a permanent\r\nsettlement \"merely by forcible methods; as in any of his [the Rajah's]\r\nincursions it would not be necessary to bring even a force with him, as\r\nthe zemindars [landed proprietors and freeholders] are much attached to\r\nthe Rajah, whom they consider as their hereditary prince, and never fail\r\nto assist him, and that his rebellion against government is not looked\r\non as a crime\": and Mr. Lumsdaine declared it \"as his clear opinion,\r\nthat the allowing the said Rajah a pension suitable to his rank and\r\ninfluence in the country would be the most certain mode of obtaining a\r\npermanent peace,\"--alleging, among other cogent reasons, \"that the\r\nexpense of the force necessary to be employed to subdue the country\r\nmight be spared, and employed elsewhere, and that the people would\r\nreturn to their villages with their cattle and effects, and of course\r\ngovernment have some security for the revenue, whereas at present they\r\nhave none.\" And the representation containing that prudent and temperate\r\ncounsel, given by a military man of undoubted information and perfect\r\nexperience in the local circumstances of the country, was transmitted by\r\nthe Resident, Bristow, to the said Warren Hastings, who did wilfully and\r\ncriminally omit to order any relief to the said Rajah in conformity to\r\nthe general sense and wishes of the inhabitants, a compliance with whose\r\nso reasonable an expectation his duty in restoring the tranquillity of\r\nthe country and in retrieving the honor of the English government did\r\nabsolutely require; but instead of making such provision, a price was\r\nset upon his head, and several bodies of British troops being employed\r\nto pursue him, after many skirmishes and much bloodshed and mutual waste\r\nof the country, the said Rajah, honored and respected by the natives,\r\nwas hunted down, and at length killed in a thicket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[59] See Hastings's Letter.\r\n\r\n[60] Sic orig.\r\n\r\n[61] 26th Dec., 1781.\r\n\r\n[62] 13th Jan., 1782.\r\n\r\n[63] 18th Jan., 1782.\r\n\r\n[64] Letter from Mr. Middleton, 2d Feb., 1782.\r\n\r\n[65] Lucknow, 22d July, 1782.\r\n\r\n[66] Major Gilpin's Letter, 15th June, 1782.\r\n\r\n[67] Mr. Johnson's letter, 9th July, 1782.\r\n\r\n[68] Ibid., 4th July, 1782.\r\n\r\n[69] Major Gilpin's Letter, 6th July, 1782.\r\n\r\n[70] Mr. Johnson's Letter, 22d July, 1782.\r\n\r\n[71] Major Gilpin's Letters, 16th June and 15th Sept., 1782.\r\n\r\n[72] Major Gilpin's letter, 15th Sept., 1782.\r\n\r\n[73] Major Gilpin's letter, 19th Oct., 1782.\r\n\r\n[74] Major Gilpin's Letter, 18 Nov., 1782.\r\n\r\n[75] Mr. Bristow's Letter, 2d Dec., 1782.\r\n\r\n[76] Mr. Bristow's Letter, 12 Dec., 1782.\r\n\r\n[77] Shoka from the Vizier to Hyder Beg Khân, 2d Ramsur, 1197\r\n\r\n[78] Bristow's Letter, 29th Jan., 1784, with inclosures.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
