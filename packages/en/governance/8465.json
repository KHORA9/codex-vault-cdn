Its\r\nconsequences are still immeasurable and today to many they appear as\r\nfraught with menace as with hope. They have within less than a year\r\nled a mighty empire to the brink of dissolution and no man can foretell\r\nwhere and how the process will end for worse or for better. The Russian\r\nRevolution saved the Central Powers at the moment when their prospect\r\nlooked darkest, but on the other hand it facilitated the entrance of the\r\nUnited States into the war as one for liberty and democracy. Time has\r\nyet to show whether the loss or the gain has been the greater for the\r\nAllied cause and for mankind. It will be paid for at a heavy price but\r\nour hope cannot easily be shaken that sooner or later an event so full\r\nof promise for the misruled millions of the autocratic empire of the\r\nTsar will mark a step forward, not backward, in the progress of the\r\nworld. The whole story of the sudden out-break in Petrograd which in\r\nlittle more than a day swept away the fabric of imperial government will\r\nnot soon be told, if ever. All real information on the subject is timely\r\nand valuable. We need such studies as those contained in the present\r\nvolume, in order that we may understand what has happened, and why it\r\nhas happened.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the modern Jugo-Slav movement offers us a very different\r\npicture. The subject and even the name are new to most people, the\r\nscale is much smaller; the events have been less dramatic. But the\r\nunconquerable resistance which a small disjointed nationality has\r\noffered throughout the ages to ill fortune, oppression, and to attempts\r\nto obliterate it entirely arouses our admiration. The movement too was\r\nintimately connected with the outbreak of the present world war which\r\ncannot be understood without taking it into account. It still represents\r\nonly an ardent hope for the future but when the day of peace and justice\r\ncomes no permanent allotment can be made of the lands east of the\r\nAdriatic that shall not give it at least some satisfaction.\r\n\r\nARCHIBALD CARY COOLIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 18, 1918. THE ROLE OF THE INTELLECTUALS IN THE LIBERATING MOVEMENT\r\nIN RUSSIA\r\n\r\nBy Alexander Petrunkevitch\r\n\r\nIn an interview dated November 21, and published in the _New York\r\nTimes_ in a special cable from Petrograd, Leon Trotzky in defending the\r\nattitude of the people toward the Bolsheviki _coup d'etat_ is reported\r\nto have said substantially the following: \"All the bourgeoisie is\r\nagainst us. The greater part of the intellectuals is against us or\r\nhesitating, awaiting a final outcome. The working class is wholly with\r\nus. The army is with us. The peasants, with the exception of exploiters,\r\nare with us. The Workmen's and Soldiers' government is a government\r\nof workingmen, soldiers, and peasants against the capitalists and\r\nlandowners.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand my father, Ivan Petrunkevitch, floorleader of the\r\nConstitutional Democratic party in the first Duma and since that time\r\nowner and publisher of the Petrograd daily _Rech_ writes in a private\r\nletter dated June 12: \"... the present real government, i. e., the\r\nCouncil of Soldiers' and Workmen's Deputies, whose leaders are neither\r\nsoldiers nor workmen, but intellectuals, etc.\" Nothing has happened\r\nduring the months intervening between the letter and the interview\r\nto change the composition of the Council appreciably. It is true that\r\nKerensky who was vice-president of the Council has been meanwhile\r\ndeposed; that Tshcheidze had to relinquish the presidency in the Council\r\nto Trotzky long before Kerensky's downfall; but the leaders of the\r\nCouncil still are intellectuals, are well educated men, some of them\r\nwell known writers on political and economic questions and withal very\r\ndifferent from the masses which they lead and which they purport to\r\nrepresent. In justice to those who had to give way to the Lenine-Trotzky\r\ncrowd of supporters, I wish to state emphatically that I do not want to\r\nput them on the same plane. Tseretelli, Plekhanov, Tshcheidze, and\r\ntheir co-workers are men of great courage, high ideals, and personal\r\nintegrity. On the other hand their successors in power are men of a\r\ntotally different type. The integrity of many of their number has been\r\nopenly questioned, the accusations, published & broadcast, remained\r\nunanswered, and no suit for libel was brought by the men thus accused.\r\nLenine was put under suspicion of having accepted German help and of\r\nhaving planned with Germany's agents the disorganization of the Russian\r\narmy. It has been even charged on apparently good evidence that the\r\nleaflets distributed at the front were printed with German money.\r\nTrotzky was accused by Miliukov in the _Rech_ (June 7) of having\r\nreceived $10,000 from German-Americans for the purpose of organizing the\r\nattack on Kerensky's government. Ganetsky was forced to leave Denmark\r\nby an order of the Danish government, having been convicted of dishonest\r\ndealings in a Danish court. Zinoviev is accused of forgery. Others are\r\nalso under suspicion which has been only increased by the arrest and\r\nimprisonment of Burtzev who is known for his untiring efforts to\r\nhunt down traitors to the cause of the Russian Revolution and who had\r\nimportant evidence in his possession. It is also a remarkable fact that\r\nthe majority of the present leaders are known broadly only under\r\nassumed names. Lenine's true name is Uljanov, Trotzky's--Bronstein,\r\nZinoviev's--Apfelbaum, Sukhanov's--Gimmer, Kamenev's--Rosenfeld,\r\nSteklov's--Nakhamkis, and a number of others whose identity is not\r\neven always known. Trotzky's assertion that the Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\nGovernment is a government of workingmen, soldiers, and peasants is\r\ntherefore nothing but a perversion of facts.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, nothing extraordinary in the fact itself that\r\nintellectuals are the real leaders of all Russian parties. Better\r\neducation and wider knowledge of the affairs of the world have always\r\nappealed to the dark masses who realize only dimly their own desires and\r\ngrasp at any concrete formulation of reforms which contains a tangible\r\npromise or seems to express those desires. At the same time they often\r\nput their own meaning into the words of their leaders, which is true\r\neven of factory workers in the larger cities. As for the peasants,\r\nrepresenting about 90 per cent of the entire population, they are still\r\nvery poorly educated, questions of national import remain outside their\r\nhorizon, and even their language is not the language of the educated\r\nRussian, inasmuch as it lacks the rich vocabulary of modern life and\r\nis devoid of the very conceptions to which this vast treasury of words\r\napplies. Their mind, great as it is in its potentialities, still moves\r\nin the furrows of familiar ideas abhorring things too much at variance\r\nwith inherited traditions or actual experience. Yet in the turmoil of\r\nrevolutionary activity the peasants are going to have their say and\r\nmay become the decisive factor, because they are voters and are casting\r\ntheir votes for those leaders whose words they believe to contain the\r\ngreatest promise and the least menace of a general disruption of their\r\naccustomed mode of life.\r\n\r\nWe are thus brought back, for the present at least, to the necessity\r\nof recognizing that even the state of anarchy under which Russia is\r\nlaboring, even the rule of the renowned proletariat so much trumpeted\r\nabout by Lenine and Trotzky, is in reality the work of intellectuals,\r\nan answer of the masses to the call of their leaders, a groping for\r\nprinciples beyond their perception.\r\n\r\nIt suffices a very casual examination of the programs and resolutions of\r\nvarious political parties to see the truth of this statement. They\r\nare expressive of the opinions of the leaders, not of the masses; are\r\ncouched in the language of the educated Russian, not in that of the\r\nworkman or peasant and, except for the concluding slogans like \"Peace,\r\nBread, and Land,\" are alien to the very spirit of the masses. In this\r\nrespect all parties are confronted with the same difficulty since all\r\nstrive to get the support of the masses, yet have to express principles\r\nevolved through careful and extensive study of national, political, and\r\neconomic problems, strange to the uneducated mind. For the same reason\r\nthe methods of surmounting the difficulty differ in many respects and\r\nare characteristic of each party.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative Intellectuals of Russia early realized the necessity of\r\nmeeting the peasant on his own ground and the advantage of appealing\r\nto him in his own language. The idea of a benevolent ruler, an\r\nall-suffering motherland, and an all-unifying church exercised a\r\npowerful appeal upon the imagination, for a long time superseding and\r\nforcing into the background the growing, elemental, and unfulfilled\r\nlonging for more land. The ideology of a perfect monarchy is so simple\r\nand its shortcomings so easily attributable to dishonesty of officials,\r\nthat it answered the peasant's thoughts as long as he was not able to\r\nsee the folly of distinguishing between the system and its realization,\r\nbut separated in his mind the image of his loving monarch from the cruel\r\nreality of everyday life as he still distinguishes between the faith and\r\nthe priest. The great mistake of all conservatives is that they seek to\r\nbring about a state of perfect justice by improving only the quality\r\nof the ruling body without changing the conditions of life of the ruled\r\nmass. Yet even so the Conservatives had quite a following among the\r\npeasants up to the time of the revolution of 1917 and in a way may still\r\nhave a future before them.\r\n\r\nThe Octoberists find no support in the masses and do not make any\r\nserious attempt to gain it. They frankly acknowledged themselves as the\r\nparty of industry and trade, having no wider interests at heart than the\r\nmaintenance of order and law throughout the country. Their leaders were\r\nforced into a revolutionary attitude only at the time when there was\r\ndanger of a universal collapse of Russia if the tsar's government\r\npersisted, and they may be forced to join in a counter-revolution,\r\nif their interests are again endangered. Their ideology is that of\r\na capitalistic class and their power depends entirely on the future\r\ndevelopment of industry and trade in Russia. For the present they are\r\nnowhere. Unable to find a new basis for their activity in place of\r\nclass interest, they lack unity of purpose and are deserted by their\r\nown former supporters among their employees. Trade and industry are\r\ndisorganized and the party may never be resurrected.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Democrats are in this respect better off. They find\r\ntheir support chiefly among more or less educated people of various\r\npursuits: lawyers, bankers, brokers, journalists, teachers, artists,\r\nscientists, etc. Their program embraces the interests of all classes\r\nand demands political, judicial, economic, industrial and agrarian\r\nlegislation of a very radical and extensive kind. Their horizon of\r\nvision includes the sufferings and aspirations of the often incongruous\r\nelements of the vast whole, but their ideology is still based on the\r\nlong outworn idealistic capitalism and for this reason alone does not\r\nand cannot appeal to not-owning classes. Their agrarian program is in\r\nthis respect the most striking example. It is worked out in great detail\r\nand is aimed at a betterment of the condition of peasants without deep\r\ninjury to the present landowners. It recognizes the right of the peasant\r\nto more land, it provides for future state ownership of land to prevent\r\nit from falling into wrong hands, but does not condemn the principle\r\nof landownership, nor the injustice of present ownership, and for that\r\nreason elaborates a method of compensation for compulsorily alienated\r\nland through universal taxation.\r\n\r\nTo avoid excessive burden to the impoverished peasant the compensation\r\nis to be in the shape of bonds representing the average value of the\r\nland in each particular case, only the interest on these bonds to be\r\npaid yearly from universal taxes--a topsy-turvy mortgage system, as it\r\nwere, in which the state becomes the proprietor and mortgagor of the\r\nland, while its present owners are turned into forced mortgagees. Under\r\nthis system the peasants will get all land available, but 90 per cent\r\nwill have to pay for what is owned by a small fraction of even the\r\nremaining 10 per cent of the entire population. The proposed scheme\r\nproved to be too radical for the tsar's government in 1906 and caused\r\nthe downfall of the first Duma. It provoked at the time bitter comment\r\nin Germany also, where the conservative and national-liberal press\r\naccused the Russian Constitutional Democratic party of putting forward\r\nimpossible demands and of attacking the very principle of property\r\nownership. Yet the principle underlying the proposed reform is\r\nunquestionably capitalistic and is the chief cause of the hatred and\r\ncontempt which the party enjoys on the part of Social-Democrats.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the sixties the conservative land committee\r\nappointed by Alexander II, composed of hereditary landowners, avowed\r\nenemies of any economic liberation of peasants, out of fear that private\r\nownership of land might enrich the peasants and make them dangerous to\r\nthe established order, devised a scheme of communal ownership of land\r\nand unconsciously taught the peasants the principles of socialism. In\r\n1907 Constitutional Democrats opposed the bill of the Government for the\r\ndissolution of land communities and substitution of private for communal\r\nland ownership at the request of individual peasants. The objection\r\nraised was on the ground that peasants suddenly possessed of a chance\r\nto get ready money would sell their land to a few exploiters and being\r\nunable to put it to good use would rapidly become paupers. The best\r\nmen in the Duma opposed Stolypin's bill, and the law was introduced by\r\nstealth and promulgated during a forced recess of the Duma. Contrary\r\nto expectation the law neither led to the results desired by the\r\nGovernment, nor to those feared by Constitutional Democrats. It\r\nremained a dead letter. Few members of peasant communities applied for\r\nseparation. The Government tried to boost its scheme by building at its\r\nown expense model, fake peasant homes. The peasants had already their\r\nown idea as to remedies in regard to land shortage and did not want any\r\nsubstitute.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of making the peasant respect the principle of private\r\nownership of land is due to many causes. The most liberal minded\r\nlandowners were usually those who spent their winters in various\r\noccupations in large cities and used their estates as summer homes and\r\na partial source of income. The work of supervision was only too often\r\nintrusted to utterly unscrupulous and uneducated managers belonging to\r\nthe peasant class, while the neighboring peasants were employed as\r\nday laborers in the field and garden. This kind of labor was already\r\navailable, because peasants were unable to derive sufficient income from\r\ntheir own land to pay the heavy taxes and to support their families.\r\nScarcely any landowners understood anything of agriculture and few paid\r\nany attention to it. I know splendid estates which brought in miserable\r\nincomes, not normal even under the antiquated system of four year crop\r\nrotation and quite absurd if measured by standards of modern American\r\nfarming, yet sufficient to place at the disposal of the owners a\r\nsplendid mansion in Moscow or Petrograd and a no less splendid summer\r\nhome on their estate. There, during the hot summer days, the owners were\r\nenjoying their comfort in idleness and talking of reforms necessary for\r\nthe benefit of the peasants, while peasant women were cutting the wheat\r\nfor them with sickles, stooping and sweating under the scorching rays of\r\nthe sun. The superintendents of those estates enriched themselves at the\r\nexpense of the blind or careless and carefree owners under the very eyes\r\nof the peasants who hated the superintendents, pitied or despised the\r\nliberal owners, as the case might be, and gloomily compared their own\r\npoverty and labor with the ease and wealth of their employers.\r\n\r\nThe more thrifty and less liberal owners, who remained the greater part\r\nof the year on their estates, were perhaps more respected but still less\r\nliked. Any attempt at careful management of the estate was invariably\r\nconsidered to be a sign of stinginess or of hardheartedness. The idea of\r\nproperty is not clearly defined in the mind of the average peasant who\r\nconsiders plants that are not planted but grow wild to be a gift of God.\r\nIn disputes involving such cases the line between rightful possession\r\nand theft is difficult to draw, and men who took the controversy to\r\ncourt were invariably hated. A glaring example of this kind was an\r\notherwise liberal minded landowner, a well known professor of sociology,\r\nwho spent three-quarters of a year in lecturing at a foreign university\r\nof which he was a member and who was finally murdered on his own estate.\r\n\r\nThe home life of even liberal intellectuals was another barrier between\r\nthem and the masses. Not only was coarse food considered to be good\r\nenough for domestics, but they seldom, if ever, had a decent corner\r\nfor themselves in the house and their miserable wages were out of all\r\nproportion with the long hours of service required. Many families had\r\nguests almost daily, the company sitting around a samovar, discussing\r\nand conversing until one or two in the morning, while the sleepy\r\ndomestics were stealing a nap in the anteroom, ready to appear at the\r\ncall of the mistress. The table had to be cleared after the guests and\r\nthe family retired for the night and the breakfast had to be prepared,\r\nboots polished, stoves heated, rooms cleaned in the early morning. For\r\nthe master might rest until ten or eleven, but the children have to be\r\nat school by eight and the servants must be ready to serve them. And\r\nthough many families kept professional servants, the country homes\r\ndepended almost entirely in winter as well as in summer on local help.\r\n\r\nAttempts to improve the condition of peasants were numerous and in\r\nsome respects successful, but found an obstacle on the one hand in the\r\nattitude of the Government and on the other in the conservatism and\r\nsuspicion of the peasants themselves. Fire insurance and cooperative\r\nenterprises helped to a certain degree, but an almost complete absence\r\nof expert agriculturists in the ranks of the landowners prevented them\r\nfrom demonstrating on their own estates the value of applied knowledge\r\nas well as from teaching the peasants how to increase the productivity\r\nof the land through intensive farming. Thus it came to pass that the\r\nvast majority of landowners, both conservative and liberal, remained\r\nstrangers to the people among whom they lived, whose labor they\r\nemployed, and for whose welfare many were in earnest concerned. The\r\nConstitutional Democratic party is strong in the cities. In the country\r\nit has no followers and in the sweeping incendiary fires of 1905-06\r\nestates were burned which belonged in several cases to men who spent\r\ntheir life in fighting for freedom against the tsar's government.\r\n\r\nNo less unfortunate is the party in its relation to the class of factory\r\nworkers. That part of its program which relates to the labor question\r\nembraces a number of important reforms meeting almost all demands of the\r\nworking class. The barrier between them is the capitalistic principle.\r\nA perusal of the lists of Constitutional Democrats who have subscribed\r\nlarge sums for the Russian liberty loan will show why workmen speak of\r\nthem as capitalists even though the party has accepted the principle of\r\nprogressive income taxation. There is a feeling of intense hatred toward\r\nall Constitutional Democrats on the part of all workmen.\r\n\r\nNothing is more instructive than the rapid change in the position which\r\nthe Constitutional Democratic party occupied in the eyes of the people\r\nafter the revolution. Before the outbreak of hostilities all parties\r\nwere against war. But soon, under the influence of the German methods\r\nof warfare in Belgium, France, and Russia, the feeling changed. Even the\r\nMensheviki among the Social-Democrats declared themselves in favor of\r\nwar and the only party remaining firm in condemning all war was that\r\nof the Bolsheviki. The entrance of the Turks into the war was almost\r\nconsidered a godsend by the Constitutional Democrats, Octoberists,\r\nand Conservatives in the Duma because it cleared the way for a final\r\nsettlement of the Balkan problem and promised the elimination of Turkey\r\nfrom Europe. Long after Sazonov was removed, when the consent of England\r\nand France to give Russia free hand in Constantinople and the Straits\r\nwas read in a telegram before the Duma, a general outburst of enthusiasm\r\ntook place, the members demanding to know why Sazonov, who was justly\r\ncredited with this achievement, was in retirement and not in charge\r\nof the foreign office which he should have held by right. Miliukov's\r\nspeeches and writings on the future settlement of the Balkan problem\r\nwere jokingly spoken of as his dissertation for the degree of foreign\r\nsecretary. At home the party was pursuing a policy of patient endurance,\r\npostponing strife for the future until the crimes of the tsar's\r\ngovernment made further silence impossible. At that time the whole\r\ntissue of treason was not yet known, but enough was in evidence\r\nto demand vigorous protest. Not being a revolutionary party the\r\nConstitutional Democrats abstained from any action not strictly within\r\nthe law and merely condemned the activity of the Government. They\r\ndesired amelioration of the fundamental laws, but even that they would\r\nhave preferred to accomplish by persuasion rather than by force. In fact\r\nthey considered socialist demands unreasonable, socialization of Russia\r\npremature, and any violent overthrow unwise and hazardous. For the\r\nlatter opinion they found support in the failure of the uprising of\r\nthe working class in 1905-06, when the punitive expeditions proved the\r\nloyalty of the army to the throne. Consequently the attitude of the army\r\nin the memorable days of the March revolution was a great surprise to\r\nthem. At the same time they attributed to themselves the lion share in\r\nthe overthrow, presumably on the ground that masses follow leaders and\r\nthe Constitutional \\ Democrats were the only ones who had a chance for\r\nopen protest in the Duma and made use of it. This delusion led to a\r\nseries of tactical errors and cost them dearly. In all elections they\r\npolled a comparatively small vote. Trying to save Russia for the Allies\r\nthey failed to meet the Russian Socialists on their own ground and were\r\nforced to explain away differences of opinion much too thoroughgoing\r\nto be explained away. In a country which is in the throes of the\r\nmost remarkable revolution ever witnessed, they tried to apply\r\nnon-revolutionary methods and drew on themselves the suspicion of\r\nthe masses of being counter-revolutionists. From the very moment when\r\nMiliukov announced the passing of the supreme power from the Tsar to\r\nGrand Duke Michail, when his words were answered by angry shouts\r\nin favor of a democratic republic, the position of the party became\r\nprecarious. They had either to revise their own program and to catch up\r\nwith the rush of the progressive current, or else to find themselves in\r\nthe role of inundated rocks over which the waters flow. The announcement\r\nthat the party would support a demand for a republic was too late\r\nto change the first impression, while the proposition to accept\r\nunconditional expropriation of land in place of the compensation plan\r\nwas defeated in heated debate at the party convention. Under normal\r\ncircumstances the party would have probably been steadily losing\r\nsupport, but the arrest and imprisonment of the best and highly honored\r\nleaders by the Bolsheviki is bound to put fresh vigor into their efforts\r\nand give new life to their cause.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Bolsheviki themselves have fallen into error of\r\na different kind. Being primarily a party of the wage earning day\r\nlaborers, the program of the Bolsheviki puts the interest of the\r\nproletariat above everything else. From insufficient observation of\r\npeasant life and the fact that peasants want socialization of land,\r\nthey jump to the conclusion that the country is ready for complete\r\nsocialization. Only the more educated leaders among them realize that\r\nsuch a conclusion is premature. But to bring about the necessary change\r\nin as near a future as possible, the leaders of the Bolsheviki have\r\nfanned hatred of the proletariat toward the \"bourgeois\" classes. One\r\nmust give them credit in this respect. They know the value of simple\r\nlanguage when they put this hatred into words. Listen to the Russian\r\nMarseillaise: \"Rise, brothers, all at once against the thieves, the\r\ncurs--the rich ones! Against the vampire Tsar! Beat them, kill them--the\r\ncursed evil-doers! Glow, dawn of better life!\" The simple ideology, the\r\neasy catch phrases in which the language of this ideology is couched,\r\nthe primeval character of the passion aroused, contribute to the success\r\nwhich the party enjoys among working people and homeless paupers.\r\nTherein lies the power of the Bolsheviki. But reaction is bound to come\r\nand here again the peasants will play the chief role. All accounts of\r\nconversations with peasants tend to show that they have very vague ideas\r\nof socialism. In fact the Social-Democrats have not taken the trouble\r\nto acquaint the peasants with the principles of their teaching, leaving\r\nthat field almost entirely to the influence of socialist-revolutionists.\r\n\r\nAmong the intellectuals none have come nearer to the understanding of\r\npeasant psychology than those men and women who from the first espoused\r\nthe cause of the peasant. Realizing the space separating educated\r\nmen from their less fortunate brothers, they gave up their life as\r\nintellectuals and \"went among the people.\" They donned peasant garb and\r\nacquired peasant tongue. From this group of workers for freedom later\r\nthe Socialist-revolutionary party developed. \"All land for the peasant\"\r\nis their slogan, while their promise to expropriate all land without\r\nany compensation naturally meets with approval on the part of the\r\nland-hungry peasants. Moreover, their program does not demand immediate\r\ncomplete socialization of Russia, leaving that to a gradual process of\r\nevolution and change of existing conditions. In the ten years preceding\r\nthe first revolution thousands of young intellectuals joined the party\r\nand fought the tsar's regime. They showed a degree of self-abnegation\r\nfound only in people whose heart is kindled with the true spirit of\r\ndevotion to a great cause. The revolution of 1905 would never have taken\r\nplace but for their organized \"terror from below.\" The high regard held\r\nfor them by the widest circles has caused their rise in power during\r\nthe first two months of the revolution of 1917. But tactical errors\r\ncommitted by the leaders of the party as well as dissensions within the\r\nparty itself contributed to a rather rapid change of sentiment toward\r\nthem on all sides. In a measure as the Constitutional Democrats\r\nvigorously objected to their policy to put into life as soon as possible\r\nthe agrarian reforms promised by them, the Social-Democrats on their\r\npart attacked them for their moderation in other demands. For some\r\nreason not yet clear, Kerensky was slighted in the very beginning of\r\nhis political career when his nomination to the executive council of the\r\nSocialist-revolutionist party was opposed by a large majority. Just as\r\nthe Constitutional Democrats made a series of tactical errors due to the\r\nfact that they thought themselves representative of the spirit of\r\nthe Russian people, whereas in reality they stood sponsors only for\r\na relatively small minority, even so the Socialist-revolutionists\r\nmisjudged the attitude of other parties toward themselves. They\r\noverrated the ability of the masses to distinguish between their\r\nattitude toward war in general and the necessity to continue the present\r\nwar. They overrated the ability of the soldiers to distinguish between\r\nslavish obedience and military discipline. They tried to play the\r\nrole of a center. They tried to mediate between Social-Democrats and\r\nConstitutional Democrats and naturally failed in this attempt. Some of\r\ntheir leaders, notably Mr. Tschernov, were accused by Constitutional\r\nDemocrats of being pro-German if not actual German agents. Others,\r\nincluding Kerensky himself and even Mme. Breshkovsky, were accused\r\nby the Bolsheviki of having been almost bribed by the capitalistic\r\ninterests of America, England, and France. Needless to say that the\r\naccusations had no basis whatever in actual facts and represent simply\r\nan ugly outgrowth of misguided jealousy of the masses to guard their\r\ndearly won right to a social revolution against those whom they consider\r\nthe worst enemies of socialism, and the desire of unscrupulous leaders\r\nto profit by it. Thus the Socialist-revolutionists were gradually\r\nrelegated in the mind of the extremists to the great body of the hated\r\n\"bourgeois.\" Only in their rightful element, among the peasants, they\r\ncontinue to enjoy a great deal of popularity, and the returns to the\r\nConstituent Assembly show that theirs will be the absolute majority even\r\nthough they lost some of their popularity.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Russian Revolution presents a sad spectacle of an\r\nalmost complete failure on the part of the majority of intellectuals to\r\nunderstand the spirit of the times and to guide the masses through the\r\nlabyrinth of errors. In days past the Russian intellectuals were the\r\nforefighters for freedom and the Russian people will ever be indebted\r\nto them for this. They prepared the soil for the revolution by spreading\r\nideas of freedom by all means at their disposal. They weakened the\r\ntsar's power and thus contributed to its overthrow by persistent attacks\r\nupon the system of autocratic government. They helped to awaken the\r\nspirit of self-consciousness in the masses. But they did not evolve new\r\nprinciples. They did not open wide avenues for the development of a\r\nnew order of social organization. They misunderstood the masses and\r\nconsequently were unable to control the forces set loose. And if Russia\r\nis going to be saved from utter ruin amidst the clamor and strife of\r\nparty leaders and to evolve a new democratic system, it will be due not\r\nto the intellectuals, but to the great spirit of the dark masses of the\r\nRussian peasants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCES BEHIND THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION FORCES BEHIND THE RUSSIAN\r\nREVOLUTION\r\n\r\nBy Samuel N. Harper\r\n\r\nOne was struck by the remarkable unity that characterized the short\r\nfirst period of the Russian Revolution of last March. One knew, however,\r\nthat there were two distinct sets of forces behind the movement,\r\noperating through two kinds of organizations. There were first the\r\nalready existing and parliamentary institutions which had become\r\nrevolutionary in spirit and methods of action. On the other hand there\r\nwere the institutions produced by the revolution itself, emerging from\r\nthe chaos in the midst of which the other, already functioning bodies,\r\nwere trying to take a new and directing line. The most prominent of the\r\nfirst type of institution was the Duma, the legislative parliament\r\nof the old regime, and of the second type, the Petrograd Council of\r\nWorkmen's and Soldiers' Deputies.\r\n\r\nThe Duma, however, was only one of several legal institutions that had\r\ndeveloped under the old regime, and represented the first stages of\r\nparliamentary, popular government. There were the local provincial and\r\nmunicipal councils, and also the officially recognized war-industry\r\ncommittees, which had come to have semi-governmental functions.\r\nFinally one could bring under this category, with a little forcing, the\r\ncooperative societies, which had assumed enormous importance during the\r\ntwo and a half years of war.\r\n\r\nIn these institutions we had self-government, and participation in\r\npublic affairs, and also the idea of cooperation between the various\r\nclasses and political tendencies--the idea of coalition. The election\r\nlaw of the Duma provided for the representation of all group interests\r\nof the community, and representation by an actual member of the group,\r\nby a _bona fide_ peasant in the case of the peasantry. The seats in the\r\nassembly were distributed specifically to landlords, manufacturers,\r\nthe smaller bourgeoisie, workmen, and peasants. The election law of the\r\nlocal government bodies made similar provision for group representation.\r\nOn the war-industry committees, the workmen had elected representatives,\r\nsitting with the representatives of the manufacturers and owners. In the\r\ncooeperative movement the bourgeois-intellectual element had taken the\r\ninitiative, but had always emphasized the direct participation of the\r\nworkmen and peasants in the actual management of the societies, as the\r\ntheory of the movement demanded.\r\n\r\nThus the broader democratic classes of the country, the workmen and\r\npeasants, were represented in the somewhat popular institutions that had\r\ndeveloped under the old regime. But the actual control was in the hands\r\nof the less democratic elements--the landlords, the manufacturers, men\r\nof the liberal professions, and of the so-called Intelligentsia class.\r\nMost of these men were of liberal and democratic tendencies, but\r\nthey were in actual fact, as compared with the broader masses, of\r\nthe privileged classes. They had emphasized always the essentially\r\ndemocratic character of the activity of the institutions in which\r\nthey were the leaders. They put particular stress on the fact that the\r\nactivities of the local provincial councils, for example, were\r\ndirected mainly toward the amelioration of conditions of life among the\r\npeasantry. But the fact that the control over these institutions, even\r\nin the cooperative movement (so far as independent control was\r\nallowed by the bureaucracy of the old regime), was secured to the\r\nless democratic elements of the community, did contradict the idea of\r\ncoalition, of the bringing together of all interests and forces. These\r\ninstitutions had been permitted to exist and develop only because\r\nthey were controlled by the more conservative groups. The cooperative\r\nsocieties represented more truly the idea of coalition. Here in the\r\ncooperative movement the leaders of political liberalism had always\r\nnoted with relief that one was gradually attaining the end toward\r\nwhich they knew they must work--the organic union between the so-called\r\nIntelligentsia, and the \"people,\" meaning the broader, democratic\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nWhen the anarchy resulting from the incompetence, stupidity and perhaps\r\ntreason of the old bureaucracy reached such an acute stage in the first\r\nweeks of March that the leaders of the Russian public saw that some\r\naction must be taken by some one, it was the Duma that assumed the\r\ninitiative, acting in a revolutionary manner, through an executive\r\ncommittee. The municipal and provincial councils, organized in unions\r\nfor war-work, and the war-industry committees, turned without delay to\r\nthe revolutionary parliament, in which many of their leading workers\r\nwere members. The leaders of the cooeperative movement could not act with\r\nsuch rapidity and precision. They had not been permitted to organize a\r\ncentral committee, to coordinate the work of the thousands of small\r\nand scattered societies. These first leaders of the revolution felt\r\njustified in taking the initiative because they alone were organized.\r\nAlso they thought they could speak in the name of all classes, including\r\nthe most democratic, because the institutions through which they acted\r\ndid include representatives of all classes. To emphasize its special\r\nanxiety that the more democratic groups feel their direct participation\r\nin the movement of which it had taken the leadership, the Executive\r\nCommittee of the Duma not only accepted but encouraged the development\r\nof the revolutionary institutions of the second category, of which the\r\nfirst to emerge was the Petrograd Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\nDeputies.\r\n\r\nThis Council was organized during the very first days of the revolution;\r\nit was in fact the resurrection of a revolutionary body of the 1905\r\nrevolution. The Duma invited the Council to share its own convenient\r\nquarters. Perhaps the invitation was an afterthought, for the workmen\r\nand soldiers of Petrograd in revolt had gravitated toward the Duma,\r\nhad calmly entered and taken possession of the large corridors of the\r\npalace. The Council was a strictly revolutionary, and a very democratic\r\nbody, composed of directly elected delegates from the factories and\r\ngarrison regiments of Petrograd. It immediately became the organizing\r\ncenter for what came to be called the \"revolutionary democracy,\" as\r\nopposed to the \"bourgeoisie.\"\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee of the Duma consulted with the Council of\r\nWorkmen's and Soldiers' Deputies on the composition of the proposed\r\nProvisional Government, and on the political program to be announced.\r\nFor as we saw, it was the first thought of these leaders to secure\r\nunity of action. They recognized that the Council did in fact represent\r\n\"revolutionary democracy,\" at least of Petrograd. As the workmen and\r\nsoldiers of Petrograd were completely out of hand, armed and fighting\r\non the streets, arresting officers, ministers and police, and showing a\r\ntendency to start general and anarchic pillaging, the Duma leaders saw a\r\nrestraining authority in the Council of these same workmen and soldiers.\r\nThey therefore either did not wish, or did not dare, to object at the\r\ntime to the famous order No. 1 to the garrison of Petrograd, issued by\r\nthe Council, and not by the Executive Committee of the Duma. Many have\r\nclaimed that this particular order, which was extended to the front,\r\nwas responsible for the later demoralization of the whole Russian army.\r\nOthers, the leaders of revolutionary democracy, have insisted that this\r\norder prevented the immediate and complete collapse of the whole army.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the slate for the new government, the Executive Committee\r\nof the Duma selected one of the presiding officers of the Council,\r\nKerensky. When Miliukov, the Duma leader, announced the composition of\r\nthe new provisional government to the crowd, composed largely of workmen\r\nand soldiers gathered in the main corridors of the Duma, he emphasized\r\nthe cooperation between Duma and Council, the consent of Kerensky to\r\nenter the government, and also the fact that most of the members of the\r\nnew government had worked in and through institutions, in which peasants\r\nand workmen also had been represented.\r\n\r\nThough the word \"coalition\" was not used during the first weeks of the\r\nrevolution, one had constantly in mind the idea of \"bringing together\r\nall the vital forces of the country.\" In this last expression I quote\r\none of the first and most emphasized slogans of the revolution. But the\r\nproblem proved most difficult, complicated by the fact that one had to\r\nsolve at one and the same time two most stupendous tasks. One had to\r\nconsolidate the conquests of the revolution, and also prosecute the\r\nwar. The prosecution of the war required the acceptance of a strong\r\nauthority, vested in the Provisional Government. But naturally the\r\nfirst aim of the revolution was to extend its ideas to the rest of the\r\ncountry, for the actual overthrow of the old order had been largely\r\nthe work of Petrograd. The two tasks were closely associated with one\r\nanother, because one could not reorganize the country for the war until\r\nthe new ideas had taken root.\r\n\r\nThe first parliamentary leaders wished to use as the basis for carrying\r\nout both tasks the old institutions, the municipal and provincial\r\ncouncils, and the cooeperative societies, at the same time taking steps\r\ngradually to democratize them. But the strictly revolutionary leaders\r\nwished to democratize immediately, and put this forward as the first\r\nobject to be accomplished. So they demanded and promoted the organizing\r\nof revolutionary democracy all over the country, through councils\r\nof workmen, soldiers, and peasants, through army committees, land\r\ncommittees, professional unions, and so forth. The champions of this\r\nimmediate democratization policy were almost exclusively members of the\r\nvarious socialist parties, some of them representing the most extreme\r\nviews. The majority of them were not consciously striving to undermine\r\nthe authority of the Provisional Government. They recognized and in fact\r\nadvocated the compromise represented in the first group of leaders.\r\nThey trusted most of them, but wished at the same time to organize\r\nrevolutionary democracy, for self-protection for the moment, and perhaps\r\nfor self-assertion at a later date. But a minority of the socialist\r\nleaders did not take this constructive line. From the very start they\r\nprofessed to distrust the first Provisional Government, for they did\r\nnot believe in \"coalition\"--the co-operation between the various group\r\ninterests of the community. Their theory was that of class struggle;\r\nthey proclaimed this to be their aim, and worked to give to the\r\nrevolution this character. Though a minority, they were a very active\r\nand energetic group, and tended to give the tone in the meetings and\r\nresolutions of revolutionary democracy, thus dulling the spirit of\r\ncooperation, which characterized the first period of the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe extremists wished a social revolution, \"permanent revolution,\" class\r\nstruggle, and they agitated openly and with energy. The workmen and\r\nsoldiers of Petrograd had borne the brunt of the physical side of the\r\nrevolution. Only workmen and soldiers had been killed fighting for\r\nthe revolution during that first week. These particular groups were\r\ntherefore proclaimed the \"pride and flower of the revolution,\" and\r\ntold that they must establish the dictatorship of the proletariat,\r\nthus consolidating the conquests of the revolution, which should not be\r\nallowed to remain a mere bourgeois affair.\r\n\r\nThe moderate, constructive socialists did not accept this extreme view,\r\nbut they nevertheless recognized the need for an effective organization\r\nof revolutionary democracy all over the country, to ensure the adoption\r\nof truly democratic policies. So they also set about to strengthen and\r\nextend the councils and committees that had emerged with the revolution,\r\ncoordinating them in conferences and formal congresses. Much of the\r\nactivity along these lines was in fact of a constructive character.\r\nBut class and party considerations were always in the foreground at all\r\nthese congresses. Also the constructive socialists did not accept the\r\nidea of a formal coalition at the beginning. They did not participate as\r\norganizations in the first government. Kerensky was a socialist, but\r\nhe entered the first government as a member of the Duma, and not as the\r\nrepresentative of the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of a conference of the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\nDeputies, called during the fourth week of the revolution, summarizes\r\nthe attitude of revolutionary democracy toward the problem of the\r\nmoment. The full text of the resolution, given in a literal translation\r\nto preserve as far as possible the style of the original, is an\r\ninteresting document:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas the Provisional Government, that was brought into power by the\r\noverthrow of the autocracy, represents the interests of the liberal and\r\ndemocratic bourgeoisie, but shows a tendency to follow the right line,\r\nin the declaration published by it in agreement with the representatives\r\nof the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies, therefore the\r\nall-Russian Conference of Councils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies,\r\nwhile insisting on the need of constant pressure being brought to\r\nbear on the Provisional Government to arouse it to the most energetic\r\nstruggle with the counter-revolutionary forces, and to decisive measures\r\nin the direction of an immediate democratization of the entire Russian\r\nlife, nevertheless recognizes that political expediency dictates support\r\nof the Provisional Government by the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\nDeputies _so long_ as the Provisional Government, in agreement with the\r\nCouncil, moves inflexibly toward the consolidation of the conquests of\r\nthe revolution and the extension of these conquests.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression \"so long as,\" emphasized in the translation of the\r\nresolution, has been one of the most far-reaching of the formulae\r\nproduced by the revolution. Around this phrase has centered the struggle\r\nof these last months. The extremists decided from the very start that\r\nthe condition had not been fulfilled. The more moderate socialists took\r\nan attitude of constant watchfulness, and latent distrust.\r\n\r\n\"Revolutionary Democracy\" could not be organized in a week or a\r\nmonth, so for the first period it was represented by the revolutionary\r\ndemocracy of Petrograd, through the Petrograd Council of Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Deputies, supplemented by delegates from similar councils of\r\nother cities, and by representatives from the army at the front. It was\r\nmore difficult to organize the peasants scattered through the country,\r\nand not concentrated in barracks or factories. The workmen and soldiers\r\nof Petrograd therefore assumed to represent all revolutionary democracy,\r\nand they had the physical force behind them. They were there on the\r\nspot, at the administrative and political center inherited from the\r\nold regime, ready to act without delay when they decided that the\r\nProvisional Government should no longer be supported. And the workmen\r\nand soldiers of Petrograd were being won over gradually to the\r\nextremists, the Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\nAs the Provisional Government was aiming first of all to preserve\r\nsocial peace, adopting a policy of conciliation, it did not oppose the\r\nsupervision exercised by the Council. In fact it realized that only\r\nrecognition of such supervision would ensure any measure of common\r\naction. The Duma committee had been asked to efface itself, for as\r\nan institution of the old regime it aroused the suspicions of the\r\nrevolutionary bodies. The efficiency of the local government bodies was\r\nsacrificed to the idea of immediate democratization. The establishment\r\nof revolutionary committees all over the country, and in the army even,\r\nwas countenanced and accepted, though perhaps only because it was seen\r\nthat it could not be prevented except by repressive measures, to which\r\nthe first leaders were unwilling to resort. Perhaps also the latter\r\nrealized that physical force was not on their side.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies acted on the principle\r\nof a direct mandate from the whole people. It issued orders to\r\nrevolutionary democracy, as we saw. It insisted on the exercise of a\r\nreal control, even on the right to countersign, as it were, some of the\r\norders of the Provisional Government. Then it definitely questioned the\r\npolicy and measures of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister\r\nof War. When these two men were forced to resign, the other members\r\nof the government demanded that revolutionary democracy share in the\r\nresponsibility of government, if it insisted on such a measure of\r\ncontrol. The Councils at first refused, but later agreed, and a frankly\r\nand officially recognized coalition government was formed. Socialists\r\nentered the government not only as members of their respective parties,\r\nbut as representatives of revolutionary democracy organized in the\r\nCouncils, which now contained delegates from the peasantry, hurriedly\r\nbrought in by a somewhat artificial system of representation.\r\n\r\nThe first Coalition Government drew up a program of policy. As this\r\nprogram was somewhat vaguely worded, coalition in the strict and true\r\nsense of the word was not secured. The socialists had entered the\r\ncoalition under pressure, as we saw. Some of them felt called upon to\r\njustify the step in a statement, later discovered and made public, to\r\nsocialists of other countries. In the statement they explained that they\r\nhad entered the government, in order to \"deepen and extend the class\r\nstruggle.\" And this is what some of them did actually start in to do,\r\nusing their authority and powers as ministers to turn the organs of\r\nrevolutionary democracy in this direction, promoting suspicion of and\r\nantagonism toward the bourgeoisie. The socialist ministers also held\r\nthemselves directly responsible to the Councils. Finally the socialist\r\nmembers of the government tried to force immediate decisions on\r\nquestions of a fundamental nature, which should be decided only by the\r\nConstituent Assembly, thus not adhering to the program drawn up as the\r\nbasis for the coalition. The position of the non-socialist members of\r\nthe government therefore became untenable, and a whole group of them\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of the most influential bourgeois group of the first\r\nCoalition Government coincided quite accidentally with an armed uprising\r\nwhich the extremists, the Bolsheviki, had been planning for several\r\nweeks. For the extremists were again putting forward their demand,\r\nthis time supported by armed force, that all the \"capitalist\" ministers\r\nresign, and that all authority pass into the hands of the Councils. But\r\nthe Councils refused to take over authority, the constructive majority\r\nreplying that they would not accept the responsibility. In their\r\njudgment only a government representing all the vital forces of the\r\ncountry, that is a coalition government, could succeed. The moderate\r\nsocialists prevailed in the Councils, and a second coalition was formed,\r\nthis time under the presidency of a socialist, Kerensky. Some\r\nweeks elapsed before the new government was finally organized. The\r\nnon-socialist groups were willing to enter a coalition government led\r\nby a socialist, but only on a definite program, which would exclude all\r\nfundamental legislation. Objection was raised also to certain individual\r\nsocialists, whose record in the first coalition government made one\r\ndoubt their willingness to adhere honestly to any coalition program.\r\nThis objection was withdrawn later; but the non-socialists gave\r\nonly their second-best men as members of the new government. The\r\nnon-socialists also had demanded that the Provisional Government be\r\nabsolutely independent, its members not responsible to any councils or\r\nparty committees. For the Councils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies\r\nwere as we saw exclusively socialistic, and had become mere party\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the democratization of local government bodies was\r\ngoing on apace, and very successfully in view of the chaotic conditions\r\nproduced by revolution and war. As the new local municipal and\r\nprovincial councils, elected by universal suffrage, began to convene,\r\nthe revolutionary committees and councils were expected gradually to\r\ndisappear. The elections for the Constituent Assembly were to take place\r\nas soon as the new local governing bodies could verify and correct the\r\nlists of voters. The Constituent Assembly was to replace definitely not\r\nonly all revolutionary councils and committees, but also the Duma,\r\nwhich continued to exist legally, though without functioning. The\r\nmain objective of the constructive elements was to hold the situation\r\ntogether until the Constituent Assembly could be convened; the date had\r\nbeen advanced, even at a sacrifice of regularity in election procedure.\r\nAnd a coalition government seemed to be the only possible solution,\r\ndespite the difficulties already encountered in applying the principle.\r\n\r\nThe councils, the land committees and the other organizations that had\r\ncome into existence with and in the course of the revolution were, as we\r\nsaw, almost exclusively socialist in their political affiliations.\r\nThis was true even of the peasant congresses, though it was generally\r\nadmitted that the bulk of the peasantry was not consciously socialistic.\r\nOf all the revolutionary bodies the peasant councils were clearly the\r\nleast representative. This was particularly true of the first alleged\r\nall-Russian Peasant Congress. The peasantry, the great mass of the\r\npopulation, became articulate very slowly. The non-socialist groups were\r\nstriving to bring about a more true expression of peasant views;\r\nand their moderate program was making headway, though they found\r\nit difficult to compete with the extremists, who made most generous\r\npromises. But the non-socialist groups were beginning to take a\r\nstronger line, as they saw the experiments of the extremists lead to\r\ndisillusionment. They proposed to organize councils and congresses of\r\nthe non-socialist elements. This project was immediately branded as\r\ncounter-revolutionary by \"revolutionary democracy.\" Perhaps to ward off\r\nthe contemplated move of the non-socialists, Kerensky issued a general\r\ninvitation for a state conference at Moscow of all parties, groups,\r\nand organizations, at which the opinions of all could be expressed,\r\npresumably for the guidance of the Coalition Government.\r\n\r\nThe Moscow Conference did in fact give to all organizations, Duma,\r\nCouncils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies, the recently elected\r\nlocal-government bodies, cooeperative and professional unions, in\r\nfact every group, socialist and non-socialist, revolutionary and\r\npre-revolutionary institutions, the opportunity to express views.\r\nThe speeches did perhaps help the Coalition Government to sense the\r\nsituation with which it had to deal, though the Conference showed that\r\nthe Coalition Government was unstable, and that the extreme ideas of\r\nthe Bolsheviki had penetrated deeply in the broader masses. Again\r\nthe Bolsheviki attacked the principle of coalition, and demanded that\r\nrevolutionary democracy take over all authority.\r\n\r\nThen came the Kornilov affair, which in its conception was an effort on\r\nthe part of the constructive groups, including the moderate socialists,\r\nto discredit the extremists, and establish a stronger government, free\r\nfrom party ties and party programs, representing a national movement\r\nto organize \"all the vital forces of the country,\" to use again the\r\nphraseology of the revolution. But there was a misunderstanding, and\r\nalso perhaps it was premature--\"revolutionary democracy\" was not yet\r\nsufficiently sobered to accept a program of common constructive effort.\r\nThe movement had the opposite effect; it split the country into two\r\nopenly hostile camps, and brought revolutionary democracy still more\r\nunder the influence of the extremists. The Coalition Government fell to\r\npieces, and a Directorate of Five, with almost dictatorial powers, still\r\nheaded by Kerensky, assumed authority.\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki now demanded the absolute and final renunciation of\r\nthe principle of coalition, and the formation of a purely socialistic\r\ngovernment. Kerensky and the constructive socialists refused to\r\nparticipate in such a government, and opened negotiations with the\r\nnon-socialist leaders, to attempt once more the coalition form of\r\ngovernment. The extremists then sent out a call to \"revolutionary\r\ndemocracy\" to meet in another conference, which they called a Democratic\r\nConference, as opposed to the State Conference of Moscow. They declared\r\nthat no bourgeois, counter-revolutionary group would be admitted to\r\nthe conference. Kerensky allowed the conference to meet. It passed\r\ncontradictory resolutions, first voting against the principle of a\r\ncoalition form of government, but later seeming to advocate and support\r\nthis principle. The moderate socialists fought hard for the coalition\r\nidea, and Kerensky and his followers seemed at last to have won out. In\r\nany case, at the beginning of October, Kerensky formed a third coalition\r\ngovernment, and convened a preliminary parliament in which all parties\r\nwere represented. This time a definitely outlined program, as the basis\r\nfor cooeperation, was accepted by the socialists, which made it possible\r\nfor the non-socialists to give their best men to the new combination.\r\nThe Provisional Government of October 8, at least the fifth since the\r\nrevolution, and the third Coalition Government, unquestionably brought\r\ntogether the strongest and most representative group of men since the\r\nrevolution. The Bolsheviki declared their intention to break it up as\r\nquickly as possible, and there was not much optimism in non-socialist\r\ncircles; one felt that it would not survive many weeks. But this third\r\nCoalition Government gave a greater promise of success than any previous\r\nattempt. There was hope that it would last, and hold the situation\r\ntogether, at least until the Constituent Assembly could meet.\r\n\r\nThis hope was not realized, as we know, and the break-up of the\r\ngovernment came within a month, when the Bolsheviki at last accomplished\r\ntheir long-planned armed uprising, and by force established what they\r\ncalled the dictatorship of the proletariat. Acting on the very eve of\r\nthe opening of the Constituent Assembly, the elections for which were\r\nalready in progress, the Bolsheviki showed clearly their contempt for a\r\nreally national, popular form of government. The Bolshevik uprising was\r\nfollowed by civil war. But this was the aim of the extremists, for they\r\nwere against social peace, cooperation, coalition, and were striving for\r\nclass war.\r\n\r\nUntil this last month the Russian Revolution, though marked by extreme\r\nantagonisms, and much wrangling, was nevertheless comparatively peaceful\r\nin character. There was no extensive violence, such as would justify\r\nthe use of the term \"civil war.\" It was to avoid civil war that such\r\nconstant, and on the whole honest, efforts were made to \"unite all\r\nthe vital forces of the country.\" For it was seen that civil war would\r\nperhaps ruin the revolution, and in any case would eliminate Russia as\r\na factor in the war, and the constructive leaders constantly emphasized\r\nthat on the successful outcome of the war depended also the success of\r\nthe revolution. But the efforts of the more constructive and moderate\r\ngroups failed. This very short outline of the attempts to solve the\r\nproblems with which revolutionary Russia was confronted by applying the\r\nprinciple of coalition gives an interpretation of the recent events in\r\nRussia from another angle. In any case one has tried to point out the\r\nforces in conflict during these last months, perhaps suggesting one of\r\nmany possible issues from the present chaos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nBy Frank Alfred Golder\r\n\r\nThe intelligent public that has been watching the erratic courses which\r\nthe Russian ship of state has been sailing during the last few years\r\nsuspected that something was wrong with it, but not until after\r\nthe March revolution did it become fully known what incompetent and\r\nirresponsible officers were in command. It was then learned that a great\r\npart of the time the Emperor was either drunk or doped, that the Empress\r\nwas hysterical and on the verge of a mental breakdown, and that they\r\nwere assisted by senile Sturmer, mentally unbalanced Protopopov, and\r\nprofligate Rasputin, none of whom could read a compass nor lay out a\r\ncourse and steered the ship as they willed. All the passengers, first,\r\nsecond, and third class, grand dukes, intelligentsia, and laborers saw\r\nthe danger and shouted warning but the officers neither saw nor heard.\r\nIn order to save themselves and the vessel each class of passengers,\r\nquite independent of the other, resolved that at the first opportune\r\nmoment it would throw the officers overboard and take charge of the\r\nship; but while they were plotting the crew mutinied, arrested the\r\nofficers, and left the ship to drift in sight of the breakers.\r\n\r\nNicholas Romanov is to blame for the plight of his country and for his\r\nown misfortunes. He was warned, he was given his chances, but he abused\r\nthem all. When he entered on his reign he was popular and had the good\r\nwill of his people with him. For some reason or other it was assumed\r\nthat he was liberal minded and that under him the people would breathe\r\na little more freely than under his autocratic father. This hope was so\r\nstrong that it was unconsciously accepted as a fact. Stories were told\r\nthat the Tsar fraternized with students and workmen and that he was\r\ndetermined to destroy the bureaucratic wall which kept the people from\r\nhim. It was on the strength of this report that the Zemstvo of Tver\r\npetitioned him that in the future it might have direct access to him and\r\nhave a say in the government. Here was a great opportunity but he turned\r\nit against himself. His reply was, \"It has come to my attention that\r\nrecently some people have been carried away by senseless dreams that the\r\nrepresentatives of the zemstvos should take part in internal affairs.\r\nLet it be known to all that I shall guard the autocracy as firmly as did\r\nmy father.\" This was his program and it deeply disappointed the\r\npeople. On the top of this came the tragedy at Moscow on the day of his\r\ncoronation when hundreds of people lost their lives in the attempt to\r\nobtain a loving cup which was promised them in commemoration of the\r\nevent. Then followed the wholesale killing of the factory hands at\r\nIaroslav, of the peasants in Kharkov, the miners on the Lena, and other\r\nsuch massacres and pogroms. Nicholas himself withdrew to his palaces and\r\nleft the affairs of state in the hands of the court clique which dragged\r\nRussia into the Japanese war and brought on the revolution of 1905.\r\nBefore it was over the Emperor promised a constitution but as soon as\r\nthe disturbance was quelled he went back on his word.\r\n\r\nIt was known that he was weak and he now proved that he was also a liar.\r\nHe dismissed one Duma after another, he created an upper house to act as\r\na brake, he juggled with the electoral laws so that whereas according to\r\nthe law of December 24, 1905 the working classes and the peasants were\r\nentitled to 68 per cent of the Duma's representation, by the law of June\r\n14, 1907 they were allowed only 36 per cent, Poland's delegation was cut\r\ndown from 37 to 12 per cent, Caucasus' from 29 to 9, Siberia's from 21\r\nto 14, and Central Asia's from 23 to 1. In fact he did everything to\r\nmake the Duma ineffective and a laughing stock. But that was not enough,\r\nhis pride was hurt and he wanted to be revenged, and the number of\r\npeople arrested, imprisoned, exiled, and executed for political crimes\r\nwas greater than before.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Nicholas was not cruel and the blame for the\r\nbloody deeds in his reign was laid to his ministers. Indeed, there\r\nis something in his face that is kindly and makes a very good first\r\nimpression. But those who knew him better had learned to distrust that\r\nsmile. When the Emperor was most gracious to one of his ministers it was\r\na sign that his resignation would be called for the next day. In this\r\nrespect Nicholas II was like Alexander I. The following story tells\r\nsomething of the real character of the man who had the lives of millions\r\nof people at his mercy. The committee appointed by the Duma to take\r\ncharge of the papers of the Tsar found that many important documents\r\nof state, such as reports from the commanders-in-chief, ministers, and\r\nothers, he had never read, and some he had not even looked at. They\r\ndid, however, come across a notebook which had been carefully kept and\r\nguarded. On opening it they noted that Nicholas, with his own hand,\r\nwrote down the names of those revolutionists who, in 1905-06, were\r\nexecuted, the kind of execution, and other such details. [FN:\r\nThis story was told to the writer by a member of the committee.] That\r\ninterested him, but matters of state he left to his time servers, to\r\nhis hysterical wife, yes, to Grigory Rasputin, a dirty, ignorant, and\r\nlicentious peasant, until the country blushed with shame and it became a\r\nsaying, \"Now we have Grigory I [Rasputin] as tsar.\"\r\n\r\nThe present war was declared by the Tsar but the people approved it\r\nbecause they hoped that the defeat of Germany would mean the defeat of\r\nthe German reactionary influence in Russia, especially about the court,\r\nand a closer union with democratic England and France. I was present at\r\nthe capital at the time that the war broke out and heard the cheers when\r\nthe Emperor made the declaration. It seemed as if Nicholas by coming out\r\nagainst Germany had redeemed himself in the eyes of his people who were\r\nwilling to wipe out the past, and give him another chance. During the\r\nfirst months of the war he was as popular as during the first weeks of\r\nhis reign. It was not like the Japanese war when the soldiers refused\r\nservice; in this German war, the men called to colors went without a\r\nmurmur, they hoped that something good would come out of it. Offers of\r\nhelp from individuals as well as commercial and civic bodies poured in\r\non the Government. The ministers said that everything was ready, that in\r\na few months the Russians would be in Berlin. At first, all went\r\nwell, but soon news came of the catastrophe in eastern Prussia, of\r\nthe traitorous acts of the Minister of War, of the campaign in the\r\nCarpathians where the Russians were slaughtered like sheep because they\r\nhad no guns, no ammunition, and no supplies. Again the poor people were\r\nbetrayed and a cry of horror and vengeance went up as on January 9,\r\n1905, Bloody Sunday. The Tsar would probably have been overthrown there\r\nand then had it not been for the war and the hatred of Germany. The\r\nliberals and patriots of all kinds thought that all was not yet lost\r\nand they went to work with a will, giving themselves, their money, their\r\nstrength, and their lives, but they soon became convinced that it was\r\nall in vain so long as Rasputin, the Empress, and their clique ran the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n     [FN: Several months before the revolution the following\r\n     confidential conversation took place between Alexeiev, the\r\n     Russian commander-in-chief, and a journalist:\r\n\r\n     ALEXEIEV: I can get nothing from them [ministers]. My\r\n     supplies are decreasing.... It is even necessary to think.\r\n     Through the Duma they begged the Emperor to put in ministers\r\n     whom the people could trust, but he, as if to show his\r\n     contempt for public opinion, selected men of low character,\r\n     one worse than the other, men with whom even decent\r\n     monarchists would not shake hands, and in shame withdrew\r\n     from court.]\r\n\r\n     [FN: about bread.

Our army is now in condition to crush Germany and without\r\nthat there can be no real peace in Europe. But a permanent peace is not\r\nwanted by Sturmer and Protopopov, they wish to keep the people under\r\nthe heel of a strong Germany. Apart from the Germans no one will protect\r\nthem from the revolution. The pity of it all is that at the head of\r\nthe government there still are men who are interested in crushing the\r\npeople.]\r\n\r\n     [FN: Princess Vasilchikov, a prominent court lady, became\r\n     convinced that the Empress and her ministers were ruining\r\n     the country and therefore wrote her a courteous letter,\r\n     pleading with her to save Russia. For her pains she received\r\n     an order to retire to her estate, and her husband, who held\r\n     a very prominent position, left the capital with her.\r\n     (_Novoe Vremia_, March 11-24, 1917.)]\r\n\r\nMembers of the royal family and the grand dukes urged the Tsar to change\r\nhis course and not ruin the country and the dynasty but he, drugged by\r\nDr. Badmaev and duped by Rasputin, Protopopov and Company, sent them all\r\nout of the capital with orders not to return until sent for. They became\r\nso desperate that they murdered Rasputin but the Empress remained and\r\nthe government policy became more reactionary than ever and as Prince\r\nIusupov said the country was drifting to destruction or to a state of\r\nanarchy. It was quite evident that the only way to save the country was\r\nthrough a revolution and it was merely a question whether it would come\r\nfirst from the top or from the bottom and when.\r\n\r\n     [FN: As late as October, 1916, the old Empress saw her son\r\n     at Kiev and pointed to him that Rasputin and the other\r\n     members of the court circle would overthrow the dynasty and\r\n     destroy the country but it did no good. Only a few days\r\n     before the outbreak of the revolution his own brother,\r\n     Mikhail Alexandrovich, pleaded with him along the same lines\r\n     and with the same success. (_Rech_, March 7-20, 1917.)]\r\n\r\n     [FN: The old and scholarly Grand Duke Nicholas\r\n     Mikhailovich went to see the Emperor about November 1, 1916,\r\n     and in order to impress him with the critical situation of\r\n     the country he wrote out his ideas so as to leave them. He\r\n     was received in a kindly manner by the Tsar who listened to\r\n     the reading of the letter and then took it over so as to\r\n     read it to the Empress. When he came to the place where her\r\n     name was mentioned she snatched it from him and tore it up.\r\n     In the course of the conversation that followed the old Duke\r\n     said some sharp things but he could not get anything but\r\n     smiles from the Tsar, and when the old man's cigarette went\r\n     out the Tsar lighted it for him. It was impossible to get an\r\n     out and out talk, or satisfaction of any kind, and Nicholas\r\n     Mikhailovich left the court in disgust. Two days later he\r\n     was requested to retire to his estate for two months. Here\r\n     is the Grand Duke's letter:\r\n\r\n     \"You have said more than once that you would carry on the\r\n     war to a successful finish. Do you believe that with the\r\n     conditions as they exist at present in the rear this can be\r\n     done? Are you acquainted with the internal situation, not\r\n     only in the interior of the Empire but also on the outskirts\r\n     (Siberia, Turkestan, Caucasus)? Are you told all the truth\r\n     or is some of it concealed from you? Where is the root of\r\n     the evil? Allow me to tell you briefly the essentials of the\r\n     case.\r\n\r\n     \"So long as your method of selecting ministers was known to\r\n     a limited circle only affairs went on somehow, but from the\r\n     moment your system became generally known it is stupid to\r\n     govern Russia in that way. Repeatedly you have told me that\r\n     you could trust no one, that you were being deceived. If\r\n     that is true then the same influences are at work on your\r\n     wife, dearly beloved by you, who is led astray by [--].\r\n\r\n     [FN: the evil circle that surrounds her. You trust Alexandra\r\n     Fedorovna--that is easy to understand. But that which comes\r\n     out of her mouth is the result of clever fabrication and not\r\n     the truth. If you are not strong enough to remove these\r\n     influences from her, at least put yourself on guard against\r\n     this steady and systematic interference of those who act\r\n     through your beloved. If your persuasion is ineffective, and\r\n     I am certain that you have more than once fought against\r\n     this influence, try some other means so as to end with this\r\n     system once for all. Your first impulses and decisions are\r\n     always unusually true and to the point, but as soon as\r\n     another influence comes in you begin to hesitate and end up\r\n     by doing something different from what you originally\r\n     decided. If you should succeed in removing this continuous\r\n     invasion of the dark forces there would take place at once\r\n     the birth of a new Russia, and there would return to you the\r\n     confidence of the greater number of your subjects. All other\r\n     matters would soon settle themselves. You would find people\r\n     who under different conditions would be willing to work\r\n     under your personal leadership. At the proper time, and that\r\n     is not far distant, you can of your own free will organize a\r\n     ministry which should be responsible to you and to\r\n     constitutional institutions. This can be done very simply,\r\n     without any force from outside as was the case with the act\r\n     of October 17, 1905. I hesitated a long time before\r\n     venturing to tell you this truth, and I finally consented\r\n     when your mother and sister urged me to do so.

Last fall (1916) there came to his home one\r\n     of his friends, an aide-de-camp of one of the grand dukes,\r\n     and confided to him that he was meditating an act of\r\n     terrorism in order to get a certain person out of the way.\r\n     Another topic of conversation was the revolution after the\r\n     war.]\r\n\r\n     [FN: \"I will say this--at court there reigned a kind of\r\n     nightmare, each day fewer and fewer people remained there.\r\n     If the revolution had not broken out from the bottom it\r\n     would have from the top.\" Interview given out by Prince\r\n     Iusupov, in _Novoe Vremia_, March 14-27, 1917.]\r\n\r\nIt is only since the political upheaval that the activities and plans of\r\nthe grand dukes have become public, but the cry for a revolution on\r\nthe part of the great mass of intelligent people was heard before and\r\neverywhere. On my return to Russia, in February, 1916, after an absence\r\nof a little more than two years, I noticed many changes but none greater\r\nthan in the public opinion in regard to the administration. On the\r\nway across Siberia, I met with many Russians, some of whom were army\r\nofficers, and one and all bitterly criticized the government for its\r\nmismanagement of the war, for the betrayal of Russia as they called it,\r\nfor its incompetency, and general worthlessness. At the capital, it was\r\nthe same, everywhere, street, car, and public places, the government was\r\ndenounced; there was no attempt at concealment. In the archives where I\r\nworked, which are almost under the very nose of the imperial family,\r\nthe criticism was as open as in private homes. In fact there was no\r\nexception. When mention was made of the Court, of Rasputin, and of the\r\nEmpress, there was a kind of a painful smile; it was not a subject that\r\nself-respecting patriotic Russians liked to talk about in public or\r\nbefore strangers; it was like dirty linen that ought not to be hung out\r\nfor public view.\r\n\r\nThere was reason enough and suffering enough to justify the complaining.\r\nPetrograd was overcrowded owing to the thousands of refugees who had\r\nbeen driven there, rooms and apartments were difficult to find and very\r\nexpensive, and the cost of living had gone up so high that it was hard\r\nfor the poor to make ends meet. It was almost impossible to get about in\r\nthe city, as the war had reduced the number of cabs and the few that did\r\nbusiness asked such exorbitant fares that only the rich could afford to\r\nride in them. The street car situation was in a hopeless tangle. Even\r\nbefore the war there were not enough accommodations for the public, but\r\nsince the opening of hostilities many of the cars had broken down and\r\nthere were no mechanics to repair them and no new cars to replace them.\r\nAt a time when the population increased, the transportation facilities\r\ndecreased. Passengers poured into the cars like a stream, filled the\r\nseats, blocked the aisles, jammed the entrance, stood on the steps, hung\r\non behind, and clung to anything that might bear them along. Difficult\r\nas it was to get into the car, it was worse to get out, and it is easier\r\nto imagine than to describe the pushing, swearing, tearing, and fighting\r\nthat one witnessed. The railways were in an equally bad condition. One\r\nhad to wait weeks for a ticket. Men and women were crowded into the same\r\ncoupes; the cars were packed so full of human beings that they suggested\r\ncattle cars, except that they were not so sanitary, for they contained\r\npeople suffering from contagious diseases and were without fresh air.\r\n\r\nThe food situation was very serious. For many years, Russia had been\r\nthe granary of Europe but during the winter of 1916-17 suffered from\r\nshortage of food. Passengers told how in southern Russia grain and flour\r\nwere rotting and yet in northern Russia the inhabitants were starving\r\nowing to the breakdown of the transportation system. It was pointed out\r\nthat while the railway officials refused to give cars for bringing in\r\nthe necessities of life, yet articles of luxury, expensive fruits, and\r\nsuch things did come into the city--a state of affairs which meant,\r\nof course, that some one was grafting. Sugar could be obtained only by\r\ncards and in very limited quantities; flour could not be bought at all,\r\nand black, sour bread could often be had only by standing in long lines\r\nand for hours at a time. There were no shoes and people asked what\r\nbecame of the hides of the thousands of animals that were annually\r\nslaughtered and shot. It was said that these, like other things, were\r\nsold to Germany.\r\n\r\nAs usual the poorer classes suffered the most. The well-to-do sent their\r\nservants who after a time returned with bread; at the worst it was only\r\nan inconvenience, but the workman had no servants to run his errands.\r\nIn the morning, the laborer left his home for his work with little or\r\nno breakfast, at noon there was no luncheon for him because his wife was\r\nstanding in the bread or sugar line, and when he returned in the evening\r\nthere may have been bread enough but little else. The wife was tired and\r\ndiscouraged, the children crying and hungry, and life became a burden.\r\n\r\nWe may say that the conditions in Russia were no worse than in France\r\nor Germany. This is doubtless true, but there is this difference:\r\nthe people of France and Germany had confidence in their leaders and\r\nrealized that they were doing the best that they could, while the\r\nRussians knew they could put no trust in their Government, that the\r\nsuffering was unnecessary and was due to corruption, favoritism, and\r\nincompetency. The Russians have as much patriotism and patience as any\r\nother people, but when they saw themselves abused and imposed upon they\r\nhad a right to complain.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the criticism of the Government the other favorite topic\r\nof conversation was the revolution that would come after the war. This\r\nwas discussed as openly as the problems of war; the two were bound up\r\ntogether, first a successful ending of the war, and then a change in\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThis public denunciation and open discussion of a _coup d'etat_ came\r\nas a shock to me, for I remembered quite vividly how the same people\r\ncheered the Emperor when he declared war. Three years ago no one would\r\nhave dared to talk like that. To be sure enough was said then of\r\nthe desirability of a more liberal government, but it was a far-off\r\nquestion, one that the next generation might have to deal with. Now the\r\ntalk was of an overturn immediately after the war.\r\n\r\nThe court circle was not ignorant of what was being said for the spies\r\nkept them fully informed. In conversation with a journalist two months\r\nbefore the outbreak of the revolution, the Minister of the Interior,\r\nProtopopov, a protege of Rasputin, said that he was aware of the\r\nrevolutionary propaganda and that he was ready to face any attempt that\r\nmight be made to overthrow the government.\r\n\r\n\"I will not stop at anything,\" he remarked,... \"the first thing that I\r\nshall do is to send them [revolutionaries] from the capital by the car\r\nloads. But I will strangle the revolution no matter what the cost may\r\nbe.\" [FN: _Novoe Vremia_, March 19-April 1, 1917.] He had no doubt\r\nthat he could handle the situation and he inspired those about him with\r\nthe same confidence, particularly the Emperor whom he assured that the\r\ndiscontent was confined chiefly to the intelligentsia and to a small\r\nnumber of the gentry, and that the common people and the army were\r\ndevoted to the autocracy.\r\n\r\nTo the question that arises why the revolution, which was expected after\r\nthe war, came off before its conclusion, the answer is that the present\r\nrevolution was not planned nor desired by any one of importance; it came\r\nas a surprise to all. It just happened. If some one must have the credit\r\nor blame, it is Protopopov who was at the time suspected of being queer\r\nmentally and who has since lost his reason entirely. He was so sure of\r\nhimself and of his ability to put down the uprising and thereby\r\nshow himself a real statesman that he concluded not to wait for the\r\nrevolution to come in the ordinary course of events, but to hurry it a\r\nbit. Although there is no conclusive proof for this statement, there\r\nis plenty of convincing circumstantial evidence. We know that it was\r\nproposed to have the workmen of Petrograd strike on February 27, the day\r\nof the opening of the Duma, as a protest against the government; we\r\nknow also that to meet this situation, the Minister of the Interior had\r\nplaced machine guns in the garrets, in steeples, on housetops, and other\r\nsuch places where they could command the important streets and shoot\r\ndown the mob. The rising did not take place because Miliukov, the great\r\nliberal leader, learned that the Government was behind this move and\r\nthat preparations had been made to slaughter the unsuspecting workmen.\r\nHe, therefore, addressed them in an open letter calling on them not to\r\nmake any demonstration, and they did not. For the time being the strike\r\nwas off, but the air was full of discontent and restlessness, and it was\r\ndifficult to say when trouble would break out again. With this in view,\r\na number of representatives of various organizations met to discuss\r\nthe situation and to determine what attitude they should take and what\r\ncounsel they should give to the labor leaders. Miliukov and a few\r\nothers urged that all uprisings should be discouraged because they would\r\ninterfere with the war, would cost the lives of many innocent persons,\r\nand would accomplish nothing. There were, however, others, especially\r\nAnisimov, who argued strongly in favor of a strike, saying that this was\r\nthe opportune time to overthrow the present regime and to establish a\r\ndemocratic government.[FN: I have this story from Miliukov.] When\r\nthe revolution came off and the papers of the secret police were seized,\r\nit was discovered that Anisimov, who urged the revolt, was the paid\r\nagent of the Government and was doubtless doing its bidding. This shows\r\nthat the Government instigated and abetted the uprising. But this is not\r\nall the evidence. Between February 27 and the outbreak of the revolution\r\nmen impersonating Miliukov went to the factories, calling on the\r\nworkmen to rise against the Government.[FN: I have this story from\r\nMiliukov.] There is still another bit of evidence. In order to give\r\nthe laboring classes cause for revolt, the food supply in the factory\r\ndistricts was reduced and many people suffered from hunger and in their\r\ndesperation came out into the streets. During the revolutionary week\r\nlittle, if any, food came in, but immediately after it the soldiers\r\nfound 250,000 \"puds\" of flour, [FN: _Russkaia Svoboda_, 1917. No.\r\n3, p. 24.] enough to last Petrograd ten days, meat, besides other food\r\nhidden in police stations and elsewhere out of reach of the public. It\r\nhas been said that the Government instigated the uprising in order to\r\nbring about a separate peace with Germany. No direct proof has as yet\r\nbeen produced to substantiate this charge, and the only testimony that\r\nI have bearing on this case is the statement made by commander-in-chief\r\nAlexeiev in a confidential interview with a journalist already quoted.\r\n[FN: There is not the least bit of evidence to show that the\r\nEmperor himself was mixed up in these intrigues. Among the papers of the\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs there is but one document that throws\r\nany light on the question of a separate peace during the time of the\r\nmonarchy. It is a letter from the minister of the German Court to the\r\nminister of the Russian Court insinuating a separate peace. This letter\r\nwas shown, as was intended, to the Tsar, who read it, put it aside, and\r\ndid not answer it. This, however, does not mean that Sturmer, Protopopov\r\nand the clique of the Empress were not planning to bring about a\r\nsituation which would compel a separate peace.]\r\n\r\nThese four points--the encouragement of a revolt by the secret agents,\r\nthe impersonation of Miliukov, the concealment of food in the factory\r\ndistricts, the desire of a separate peace with Germany--make out a\r\nfairly good case to show that the Government was behind the disturbance.\r\nAside from the reason already given for the desire of a separate peace,\r\nthe other reason for the action of the ministry was this: It feared that\r\nthe revolutionary movement, if permitted to take its natural course,\r\nwould develop such strength that it could not be put down when it broke\r\nout, and, therefore, the Minister of the Interior decided to take it in\r\nhand and at the right moment crush it with such force that it would be\r\na long time before it could raise its head again. Before it was over he\r\nhoped to drag in prominent members of the Duma (or the Duma itself) and\r\nother revolutionary leaders, and make an end of them. This plan need not\r\nastonish us, for this method, in one form or another, had been made use\r\nof by the autocracy time and again. Protopopov overreached himself, his\r\nscheme miscarried, the soldiers about the capital went back on him, and\r\nthe little comedy that he had staged in which he was to play the leading\r\npart became a tragedy and the shot which was intended for the revolution\r\nhit his royal master and brought autocracy to the ground. In view of the\r\nfact that Protopopov has since become insane, one wonders whether the\r\nman was mentally well balanced at the time that he was in office. But\r\nthe Tsar has only himself to blame for his plight; he was warned against\r\nthis nominee of Rasputin, but he would not take advice.\r\n\r\nEarly in the week of March 5-12, 1917, the trouble began in the factory\r\ndistricts. There were bread riots, car stoning, window smashing, and\r\nother such acts, which are more or less common and no one paid much\r\nattention to them. On Thursday, the disturbances spread to other parts\r\nof the city and crowds began to gather on the Nevski, but the throng was\r\norderly and the police seemed to have little difficulty in keeping it\r\non the move. Friday the crowd was more bold: it marched up and down\r\nthe streets, calling for bread, singing revolutionary songs, and\r\noccasionally waving a red flag and quickly snatching it back again.\r\nThis, too, did not make much impression for it is well known that\r\nin Russia strikes and disturbances have in view political as well as\r\neconomic betterment. Late Friday afternoon, while I was walking on\r\nthe Nevski, a company of mounted police and a large number of Cossacks\r\ndashed by on the way to disperse a procession that was coming towards\r\nme. When I came up to the Fontanka Bridge I noticed the crowd was\r\ngathered about the Cossacks; it patted the horses and cheered their\r\nriders, while the police were nowhere in sight. I listened to what was\r\nbeing said and heard that the police tried to use their whips and swords\r\non the people and this angered the Cossacks so much that they attacked\r\nthe police, killed the captain, and drove them all away. It was no\r\nsecret that there was bad blood between the soldiers and the police;\r\nthe former complained that while they were suffering and fighting at\r\nthe front, the latter were having an easy time, enriching themselves\r\nby graft, and oppressing the soldiers' families. The soldiers and the\r\nstrikers started out with one idea--hatred of the police. When the\r\npolice had been dispersed, the Cossacks and soldiers begged the people\r\nto move on, but they, especially the young women students who were\r\nnumerous, went up to them and pleaded with them to espouse their cause.\r\n\"Comrades,\" they would say, \"come over on our side, our cause is your\r\ncause.\" The rough, ignorant warriors were disturbed; they did not like\r\ntheir jobs, and in a kindly way begged the men and women to go home,\r\nbut, as it did no good, for they massed again, the Cossacks rode in a\r\nbody into their midst and kept turning and turning until the crowd\r\nwas forced from the street onto the sidewalk. In the meantime, another\r\ncompany of Cossacks formed a line across the street, from wall to\r\nwall, and swept everybody before it into stores, courtyards, and other\r\nopenings. Even this did not do much good, for as soon as the horsemen\r\npassed, the mob fell in behind and cheered the Cossacks. There was no\r\nroughness, but at the same time it was easy to see that the crowd did\r\nnot yet know to what extent the army could be trusted.\r\n\r\nBy Saturday the inhabitants of the city began to feel the effect of\r\nthe disorder; cars were not running, telephones were barely working,\r\nfactories and shops were closed, banks and stores were locked, there was\r\nlittle to eat, for the only provision on hand was water; every one who\r\ncould filled the tubs for fear the water mains would be blown up.\r\nThe crowd on the streets was larger than ever, more red flags were in\r\nevidence, but all this failed to give the impression of a revolution.\r\nSuch demonstrations had been seen before; revolutionary talk was cheap\r\nand was not taken seriously. As on the day before, the soldiers and\r\nCossacks tried by gentle means to disperse the crowd, but failed, for\r\nthe men and women in the crowd complained that they were hungry and\r\npleaded with the military for the sake of their own families to stand by\r\nthe people. It was easy to see that these guardians of the peace were in\r\ntrouble, they knew that every word said was true, and what was more to\r\nthe purpose, members of their own families were in the crowd. An officer\r\nwho was sent with his company to shoot on the people told how that same\r\nmorning his own sister took part in the demonstration and called for\r\nbread for her children. This was no exceptional case. But as soldiers\r\nthey must do their duty and keep order. Realizing that the stratagems of\r\nthe day before failed in their purpose, the Cossacks tried other tactics\r\non this day. They fell behind the procession, and discharged their\r\npistols in the air and dashed at full speed into the mob. Woe unto him\r\nwho did not get out of the way. But they all did; in a second there was\r\nnot a person on the street. It is still a wonder how it was all done so\r\nquickly. As soon as the horsemen passed, the crowd dropped behind them\r\nand raising their hats cheered them. \"Comrades,\" they said, \"come over\r\nto us, you know that the government is bad, you know how the soldiers\r\nhave been killed through its incompetency, you know that our wives and\r\nchildren are hungry,\" and more such pleas. The Cossacks and the other\r\nsoldiers who tried to keep order were caught, they begged the crowd to\r\nbreak up and go home, they pointed out that they had to do their duty\r\nand that somebody might get hurt. It was reported that in some places\r\nthe soldiers did fire and kill several persons. During Saturday, men\r\nwere sent, it is not clear by whom, to the different factories to\r\npersuade the workers to join in a great demonstration on Sunday. The\r\nmilitary commander of the city telegraphed to the Emperor for orders\r\nand the latter sent word to shoot, if necessary, and to put down the\r\nuprising at any cost, and that accounts for the posters that were put up\r\non Sunday morning warning the inhabitants not to gather in the streets\r\nbecause the soldiers would shoot to kill. This had happened before and\r\nwas no joke, and many people would not leave their homes that day.\r\nThose who did had to walk; there was no other way of getting about. Few\r\npeople, on the whole, were on the street that morning aside from the\r\nsoldiers and Cossacks who were guarding the bridges and keeping an eye\r\nout for disturbances. After luncheon I started to make a call and as\r\nI passed the barracks of the Volynski regiment, situated near where I\r\nlived, I saw a company of soldiers lined up, heard the command to load,\r\nto shoulder arms, to march, and off they went to the Nevski. I followed\r\nthem for a distance and then turned aside and went my way. In returning\r\nI had to cross the Nevski and found that all avenues thither were\r\nguarded and that no one was allowed to go in that direction. I managed,\r\nhowever, by showing my American passport, to get through the line and\r\nreach the street. Excited people were moving up and down and from them I\r\nlearned that about three o'clock a number of people forced their way to\r\nthe Nevski and were fired upon by the soldiers and the machine guns that\r\nwere concealed. Among the killed of the day was a captain of police who\r\nwas knocked down by a Cossack.\r\n\r\nSunday night was full of excitement and fear and there were not many\r\nwho slept soundly. Firing was heard at different times but what it\r\nportended, none of us could tell. It became evident that the situation\r\nwas becoming serious, yet we all felt that the Government could handle\r\nit. When I went out on the street Monday morning, the first thing I saw\r\nwas the placard of the military commander announcing that unless the\r\nworkmen went to the shops, they would be sent to the front the following\r\nday. Groups of people were talking excitedly and from them I learned\r\nthat the Volynski regiment had revolted and had killed its officers,\r\nbecause the day before they had commanded the soldiers to shoot on the\r\npeople. It seems that the soldiers returned home much excited over\r\ntheir deed and full of remorse. In the course of the night some of\r\nthe revolutionary soldiers from the city upbraided them and they were\r\ngreatly incensed with their officers and the Government. They, as well\r\nas other regiments, were particularly worked up over the report that\r\nhirelings of the secret police dressed in soldiers' uniforms went about\r\nfiring on the crowd and that the new recruits, under penalty of death,\r\nwere commanded to shoot on the people in the streets. When in the\r\nmorning the officers congratulated the men on their deed of yesterday,\r\nthey jumped on them and murdered them. I heard that other regiments had\r\nalso revolted; but there were so many rumors afloat that it was not easy\r\nto know what to believe. About four in the afternoon, I started for home\r\nand found the Nevski full of frightened and nervous people, and hardly\r\nany soldiers. No one seemed to know what to expect. Sounds of shooting\r\nwere heard and they were explained as the battle between the regiments\r\nthat had revolted and those that had remained loyal. In the distance\r\ncolumns of smoke were seen and report had it that palaces were burning.\r\nAgain it was difficult to know the truth. As I proceeded on my way, I\r\nwas joined by the little minister of the British American Church, where\r\nI had attended services the day before, where he had prayed fervently\r\nfor the Tsar and his family and asked God to put down the anarchists,\r\nand other lawless men. We were discussing the situation, not knowing\r\nexactly what to make of it. Perhaps the word revolution passed our lips\r\nbut neither of us nor those about us took it seriously. Near the Liteiny\r\na gate opened and about two dozen armed soldiers led by a petty officer\r\nstepped out and marched towards the center of the street. Immediately\r\nthe crowd, excited and scared, scattered and ran for their lives but\r\nthe soldiers motioned for them to stop and told them that they would\r\nnot shoot. We left them, and proceeded on our way, trying as before\r\nto interpret what we saw. While in the midst of our discussion we were\r\nstruck by a new and unfamiliar sound--tra-ta-ta, tra-ta-ta, and we\r\ninstinctively knew that a machine gun was firing. In a flash the streets\r\nwere cleared and my minister and I found ourselves sticking like posters\r\nagainst the wall. It was my first \"baptism of fire\" and I had enough\r\npresence of mind to observe its effect upon myself and others.\r\nPhysically there was no effect for no one seemed hit. I tried to locate\r\nthe gun and the man behind it, but did not succeed. When the firing\r\nceased, I went on my way. As I neared the Nicholas station, there came\r\nrushing forth from around the corner a crowd of hoodlums and soldiers,\r\nwith drawn swords, which they had taken from the officers, and\r\nsuch other weapons as they could pick up, shouting, \"Down with the\r\nGovernment!\" Then it dawned upon me that the revolution was on in\r\nearnest, that the anarchists of yesterday's prayer had become the heroes\r\nof a great cause. What struck me most of all was the kind of men and\r\nwomen who made this world event. I watched them during the week, and\r\nthey seemed to be in great part boys and girls, hoodlums, students,\r\npoorly dressed men and women, without organization, plans, or leaders.\r\nIt is difficult to analyze the various motives that brought them out\r\ninto the street. Not one of the so-called revolutionists was seen,\r\nheard, shot, or wounded. When it was all over they appeared on the\r\nscene, rushing from Switzerland, the United States, France, and other\r\nparts of the world, to make speeches and to divide the spoils. It was\r\na revolution without revolutionists, unless you call the soldiers that,\r\nbut they were not consciously making a revolution, and when it was done,\r\nthey were thoroughly surprised and frightened. There are a number\r\nof reasons why the Government collapsed so easily. It was not really\r\noverthrown but it toppled over like a rotten tree, and until it fell,\r\nthe people did not realize how decayed it actually was. Its misconduct\r\nof the war, scandals like that of Rasputin, ministers such as Protopopov\r\ndiscredited and disgraced the dynasty and when the end came, it had few\r\nfriends who shed tears.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor in helping the revolution was the large number\r\nof students and liberals who served in the army. To fill the ranks\r\nand to provide educated men for officers, it was necessary to call on\r\nuniversity students, experts in various fields of engineering, all of\r\nwhom, more or less, desired a liberal government. These men worked among\r\nthe soldiers and officers with a view to creating a feeling of distrust\r\nin the Emperor, and the Government, and its incompetence and corruption\r\ngave plenty of material for the propagandists. Loyalty to the dynasty\r\nwas undermined and as soon as one prop was removed, as soon as one\r\ncompany of soldiers went over, the others followed and the whole edifice\r\ncame tumbling down.\r\n\r\nStill another factor was the large number of new recruits that were\r\nstationed in the capital; they were as yet not well disciplined,\r\nobedience had not yet become a second nature to them. Many of them had\r\ncome from the factories, some of them were personally acquainted with\r\nthe men and women who were in the demonstrations and therefore would not\r\nfire on them. Had there been at the time in the city three or four old\r\nand well-disciplined regiments, or had the Cossacks who were on hand not\r\ninterfered with the police, the uprising would have been crushed quickly\r\nand effectively as similar affairs had been before.\r\n\r\nYet one other factor contributed to the success of the revolution and\r\nthat was the over-confidence of the Government. The soldiers had been\r\nloyal until now and it never occurred to those in power that they might\r\nnot always be so. They made no special preparations other than placing\r\nmachine guns on roofs. They did not even make use of the armored cars.\r\nWhen they realized that the army in the city could not be trusted, they\r\ncalled for troops from the front but they came too late.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the monarchy it was unfortunate that\r\nProtopopov sent the Emperor to the front after having secured from him\r\na signed blank to dismiss the Duma; for if the Tsar had been at Tsarskoe\r\nSelo, he might have been prevailed upon to make some concessions and\r\nsaved the dynasty for a time at least.\r\n\r\nBy Tuesday morning, March 13, the revolution was generally accepted as\r\na _fait accompli_; it was believed that the old despotism was gone never\r\nto return. This was followed by an outburst of idealism and patriotism\r\nsuch as comes but once or twice in the life of a nation. Every Russian\r\nwas bubbling over with enthusiasm over the glorious future of his\r\ncountry. Liberty so greatly desired, so long worked for, so much\r\nsuffered for had at last come. The intelligent and persecuted Russians,\r\nthey who had spent years under the shadow of the police, in prison,\r\nin exile, and in Siberia, had their day at last and they were eager\r\nto realize their Utopia. Their first demand was that all prison doors\r\nshould be opened and that the oppressed the world over should be freed.\r\nThe Russian Revolution was not a class revolution, it was brought about\r\nneither by the proletariat nor by the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy;\r\nall classes contributed, it was a national revolution. So worthless had\r\nthe monarchy become that all the people were glad to get rid of it and\r\nsee it go. They who helped to bring about its ruin were the first to\r\ndeny it and seek safety; and even the Synod, in an almost unseemly\r\nhaste, took out the names of the imperial family from the prayer book.\r\n\r\nThe revolution was picturesque and full of color. Nearly every morning\r\none could see regiment after regiment, soldiers, Cossacks, and sailors,\r\nwith their regimental colors, and bands, and revolutionary flags,\r\nmarching to the Duma to take the new oath of allegiance. They were\r\ncheered, they were blessed, handerchiefs were waved, hats were raised,\r\ncigarettes were distributed as mark of appreciation and gratitude to\r\nthese men, without whose help there would have been no revolution. The\r\nenthusiasm became so contagious that men and women, young and old,\r\nhigh and low, fell in alongside or behind, joined in the singing of the\r\nMarseillaise, and walked to the Duma to take the oath of allegiance and\r\nhaving taken it they felt as purified as if they had partaken of the\r\ncommunion. Another picturesque sight was the army trucks filled with\r\narmed soldiers, red handkerchiefs tied to their bayonets, dashing up and\r\ndown the streets, ostensibly for the purpose of protecting the citizens\r\nbut really for the mere joy of riding about and being cheered. One of\r\nthese trucks stands out vividly in my mind: it contained about twenty\r\nsoldiers, having in their midst a beautiful young woman with a red\r\nbanner, and a young hoodlum astride the engine, a cigarette in one\r\nhand and a sword in the other. The streets were full of people, or\r\n\"tovarishchi\" (comrades), as they called one another, not only the\r\nsidewalks but in the very center, for the tramways were not running.\r\nGreat events were transpiring and every one who could came out to hear\r\nand to see what was going on. There were no newspapers and the street\r\nwas the news center. Automobiles came dashing through scattering\r\nproclamations and copies of the _Izvestiia_ (a news-sheet published by\r\na committee of newspaper men with the authority of the Duma); and as\r\nthe crowd made a rush to pick these up it looked for a moment as if the\r\nwhole world was walking on its head and feet at the same time. Those who\r\nwere fortunate enough to seize a paper ran home with it to read it to\r\nthe family, those who were not gathered around one of the many bonfires,\r\nmade from the wooden imperial eagles, crowns, and other insignia of\r\nroyalty, to listen to the reading of the news, usually by a student. The\r\npart played by the students during the revolution has not received the\r\nattention it deserves. When all others were hiding or excited it was\r\nthe students who took charge of the leaderless soldiers, found food for\r\nthem, collected money for their welfare, and told them what to do. It\r\nwas interesting to watch with what deference the soldiers looked up to\r\nthem and hung upon their words. This importance was not wholly lost upon\r\nthe students, both men and women, and they read the proclamations as if\r\nthey were tablets of law handed down from heaven. After the reading\r\ncame the discussion. One of the favorite topics was the comparative\r\nbloodlessness of the revolution (something like 169 killed and 1264\r\nwounded) which proved that the Russian Revolution was superior to the\r\nFrench or any other. Having started in this vein the discussion turned\r\non the mighty and noble deeds Russia was going to do now. Just as it\r\nonce freed Europe from the yoke of Napoleon so will it now liberate her\r\nfrom the militarism and barbarism of William and give freedom to all the\r\nworld, to all nationalities, races, and creeds. The light of the world\r\nis to come from Russia. The crowd meant it. The soldiers were in earnest\r\nand patriotic--the praise showered upon them and the responsibility\r\nplaced upon them seemed to uplift them--the man with the hoe became a\r\nfree citizen and behaved as such. On Wednesday, March 14, the soldiers\r\nposted bulletins in different parts of the city calling on their\r\ncomrades to abstain from liquor and violence and to prevent others from\r\ncommitting lawless deeds. Not satisfied with mere words small companies\r\nof militia visited the places where drinks were sold and emptied the\r\nbarrels and bottles into the gutter. For days the Astoria Hotel looked\r\nand smelled like a wrecked saloon after Carrie Nation and her associates\r\nhad stoned it.\r\n\r\nFor some time the whereabouts and intentions of the Tsar were unknown\r\nand numerous rumors were afloat. Some said that he had committed\r\nsuicide, that he was in the city, that he was on the way, that he was\r\nunder arrest, that he had fled the country. Another interesting question\r\nwas the form of the new government, should it be a republic or a\r\nconstitutional monarchy. Many of the educated classes and members of\r\nthe Duma advocated a constitutional monarchy of the English type, while\r\nothers, particularly the socialistic groups, favored a republic, a\r\ndemocratic republic; whatever they meant by that is not clear. Needless\r\nto say the great mass of people did not know the difference between one\r\nkind of government and another but they shouted as loudly as those who\r\nknew. One soldier demanded a republic like that of England, another\r\ninsisted on a republic with a tsar at the head, the wife of the porter\r\nof the house where I lived cried as if her heart would break because\r\n\"they wanted a republic,\" and some of the peasant women in the country\r\nclamored for the tsar because \"if they take away the tsar they will also\r\ntake away God and what will then become of the muzhik.\" In one place at\r\nthe front several regiments almost came to blows over this question. An\r\norator ended his eloquent speech by saying that \"from now on Russia\r\nwill have but one monarch, the revolutionary proletariat.\" This phrase\r\npuzzled the soldiers, they also misunderstood the word \"monarch\" which\r\nthey thought to be \"monakh\" (monk). They therefore concluded that it was\r\nplanned to put a monk on the throne, and an argument arose whether they\r\nwould have a monk or not. Some were in favor and others opposed. By the\r\ntime it got to the next regiment the question was whether they would\r\nhave the monk Iliodor as their ruler. It was no longer a question\r\nwhether Russia was to have a tsar but whether the tsar should be a monk\r\nor not, and whether it should be Iliodor or some other one.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, as evening came a kind of fear seized the population,\r\nparticularly the more ignorant. It was difficult for them to shake\r\noff the terror of the old police; all the time that they were talking\r\nagainst the tsar they had a feeling that they were doing wrong, and that\r\nsome one was denouncing them. It was hard for them to believe that all\r\nthat they saw and heard during the day was real and that the old regime\r\nwas powerless. Some one would start a rumor that a monarchist general\r\nwith an army was marching on the city and that he would kill and burn.\r\nEarly Friday evening, March 16, as I was walking down the street,\r\nsoldiers ran by me shouting for every one to get under cover for several\r\nhundred police from Tsarskoe Selo were coming and that there would\r\nbe street fighting. Frightened mothers grabbed their little ones and\r\nhurried home, storekeepers closed the shops, porters barricaded the\r\ngates, housewives extinguished the lights, and the streets became as\r\ndark and as silent as a cemetery. This lasted for an hour or more and\r\nthen came more soldiers announcing that all was well, that the supposed\r\npolicemen were revolutionary soldiers who had come to take the oath of\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\nThe exultation reached its highest point when the first temporary\r\ngovernment, with Prince Lvov at the head, was announced. Every one\r\nwas pleased with the men selected, they were without doubt the ablest\r\nleaders of the country, men who had always fought for the cause of\r\nliberty and for the interests of the public. There was nothing but\r\npraise for them and assurances of support. The fact that there was a\r\n\"pravitelstvo\" (government) calmed the people and they gradually went\r\nback to their old occupations, but as new men, with broader outlooks and\r\nwith higher aspirations.\r\n\r\nThe taking of the oath of office by the new Ministry was the last act of\r\nthat wonderful week to be unanimously approved by the people. When the\r\ntemporary government attempted to govern it was interfered with by the\r\nCouncil of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies; the cry was raised by the\r\nSocialist groups that it was they who had won the revolution and that\r\nthey, therefore, should have all the power. Since then the country has\r\nbecome more and more divided against itself, love has turned into hate,\r\njoy into sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUGO-SLAV MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nBy Robert J. Keener\r\n\r\n     [FN: As used in this paper, the term Jugo-Slav comprehends\r\n     the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, but not the Bulgars. It is\r\n     not necessary here to consider whether the latter are Slavs\r\n     or Slavicized Tartars, but merely to point out that since\r\n     the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Bulgars have taken no\r\n     part in the movement which has resulted in the creation of\r\n     Jugo-Slav nationalism. The word \"jug\" means \"south\" in\r\n     Slavic. It is also written \"youg\" and \"[iu]g.\"]\r\n\r\nIf there are miracles in history, the Jugo-Slav movement is a miracle.\r\nIt is the story of a nation which entered its new home in the Balkans in\r\nthe seventh century and became divided geographically and politically,\r\nin faith and written language, and in economic and social life, until\r\nat last its spokesmen could truthfully say that it was divided\r\ninto thirteen separate administrative units dependent upon fifteen\r\nlegislative bodies. [FN: In 1915 the Slovenes inhabiting Carniola,\r\nCarinthia, Styria, Istria, and Goerz-Gradisca, and the Serbo-Croats of\r\nIstria and Dalmatia, were under the direct rule of Austria. Trieste and\r\nits district were a part of Austria. The Serbs of Hungary belonged to\r\nHungary proper for the most part; the Croats by a fundamental agreement\r\nwere entitled to autonomy in Croatia. Fiume, the seaport of Croatia and\r\nHungary, had an administration of its own. Bosnia-Herzegovina possessed\r\na diet and was under the dual rule of Austria and Hungary. All the\r\nprovinces or districts mentioned above were governed by the two\r\nparliaments at Vienna and Budapest. There were, in addition, two\r\nindependent Serb states, Serbia and Montenegro. Down to 1912 Turkey\r\nruled over a large number of Serbs.] How did it come about that this\r\nevolution of twelve centuries, beginning with primeval unity and passing\r\nthrough a political, economic, and social decomposition of a most\r\nbewildering character, has once more arrived at national unity and\r\nis even now demanding the last step--political amalgamation? Is it a\r\ndoctrine or a dream or is it a reality?\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhen the Jugo-Slavs first occupied the western half of the Balkan\r\npeninsula, they were one in speech, in social customs and ancestry, and\r\nwere divided only into tribes. The Slovenes, who settled in the northern\r\nend of the west Balkan block, were not separated from their Croat and\r\nSerb kinsmen by the forces of geography, but rather by the course of\r\npolitical evolution. On the other hand, the Croats became separated from\r\nthe Serbs by forces largely geographical, though partially economic and\r\npolitical, in nature.\r\n\r\nThe Slovenes gave way before the pressure of the Germans who swept\r\nthrough the Alps and down the Danube and forced the Slovene vojvodes\r\nto acknowledge their suzerainty and accept their religion. The Germans\r\nwould doubtless have succeeded in obliterating them had not the Magyar\r\ninvasion weakened their offensive. The Slovenes, however, were left a\r\nwrecked nationality whose fate became blended with that of the Habsburg\r\npossessions and who against the forces of geography--which firmly bound\r\nthem to the Croats--were politically riveted to the Habsburg north.\r\nThis division was therefore the result of forces created by man and\r\nchangeable by him. The Croats settled in the northwestern half of the\r\nterritory south of the Slovenes; the Serbs roughly in the southeastern\r\npart of it. Here geographical influences--the direction of the rivers\r\nand the Dinaric ridges--combined with divergent political and economic\r\npossibilities, produced a dualism. The Croats on the Save and its\r\ntributaries naturally expanded westward and aspired to closer\r\nconnection with the sea where their struggle with the remnants of\r\nRoman civilization and a superior culture absorbed their energies.\r\nThey developed out of their tribal state more quickly, while the Serbs,\r\nfurther inland and amid more difficult surroundings, developed more\r\nslowly. The people who lived along the Save aspired to control the\r\nDalmatian coast which military and geographical authorities claim can\r\nbest be held from the mainland. The people who lived in Montenegro\r\nor along the Morava, which was the gateway to the peninsula, would\r\nnaturally expand south and east toward the other cultural center,\r\nConstantinople, and thus seek to dominate the Balkan peninsula. In both\r\ncases, the attraction proved too much for feudal kings and led to the\r\nformation of cosmopolitan empires instead of strong national monarchies.\r\n\r\nThe kingdoms of Croatia and Serbia thus parted company politically. The\r\nformer became a separate kingdom attached to Hungary in 1102 and to the\r\nHabsburg dynasty in 1527, while the Serbs began their expansion under\r\nthe Nemanja dynasty late in the twelfth century and almost realized\r\nthe dominion over the Balkans under Stephen Du[s]an in the fourteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThis political, geographical, and economic dualism became still greater\r\nwhen in 1219 the Serbs cast their lot with orthodoxy. The Croats, like\r\nthe Slovenes, adopted Roman Catholicism, the Latin alphabet, and the\r\nculture of Rome. The Serbs accepted Greek Orthodoxy, the Cyrillic\r\nalphabet, and the culture of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe Slovenes became a part of the Austrian possessions of the Habsburgs;\r\nthe Croats fell under the dominion of the Hungarian crown and the\r\nrepublic of Venice; and the Serbs succumbed to the Turks by the middle\r\nof the fifteenth century. The loss of political independence brought\r\nwith it ultimately the loss of the native nobility, the sole guardians\r\nof the constitutional and historical rights of the nations down into\r\nthe nineteenth century in central Europe. In addition, many towns were\r\nGermanized and the middle class disappeared. The Jugo-Slavs, like the\r\nCzecho-Slovaks, appeared in modern times as a nation which had lost\r\nits native nobility and had been reduced to a disarmed, untutored, and\r\nenserfed peasantry. In the absence of these leaders, the nation turned\r\nto its clergy who in order to retain their hold on the peasantry must\r\nneeds ever remain national. But here again the misfortune which awaited\r\nthe Jugo-Slavs was that historically three religions had taken deep\r\nroot, the Catholic among the Slovenes and Croats, and the Mohammedan and\r\nOrthodox among the Serbs. We may therefore conclude the first half of\r\nthe historical evolution of the Jugo-Slavs with the observation that\r\npolitical, economic, social, and geographical divisions led to their\r\ndownfall as a nation and that if they ever desired to become one, each\r\none of these chasms would have to be bridged. A solution for each of\r\nthese problems--the most difficult which ever faced a nation--would\r\nhave to be found; meanwhile the policy of the four masters, the German,\r\nVenetian, Magyar, and Turk, would always be \"divide and rule,\" in other\r\nwords, to perpetuate the divergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe history of the evolution of the Jugo-Slavs from the sixteenth to the\r\ntwentieth century has been an effort to find the means of melting down\r\nthese differences until finally one--nationalism--accomplished the\r\npurpose. Unity came first in the imagination and the mind, next in\r\nliterature and speech, and finally in political action. The four hundred\r\nyears beginning with the fifteenth and ending with the eighteenth\r\ncentury will be remembered by the Jugo-Slavs as the age of humiliation.\r\nOnly Slavicized Ragusa and indomitable Montenegro kept alive the\r\nimagination of the nation which was brought back to life by the\r\nhalf-religious, half-national Slovene poets of the sixteenth century, by\r\nthe Ragusan epic poet [Gundulic], by the incessant demands of successive\r\ndiets of the ever-weakening Croatia in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, and by the progressive and zealous Serbs of Hungary, who ever\r\nsince the fifteenth century in increasing numbers made their home there,\r\nrefugees from the oppression of the Turk, but who ever longed to push\r\nout from the frontier and rebuild Serbia anew. [Krizanic], a Croat\r\nCatholic Dalmatian priest, a firm believer in Jugo-Slav and Slavic unity\r\nin general, appealed to the rising Russian empire to help save dying\r\nSlavdom.\r\n\r\nWhile the Turkish and the Venetian empires decayed, the Austrian and the\r\nRussian gained courage. By the end of the seventeenth century the house\r\nof Habsburg had won back all except the Banat and in the eighteenth\r\ncentury aspired to divide the Balkan peninsula in halves with the\r\nRussians. Along with this future foreign interference in the affairs\r\nof the Balkans came the Germanizing and centralizing \"reforms\" of Maria\r\nTheresa and Joseph II, whose result was to cripple still further the few\r\nconstitutional and historical rights which remained to the Jugo-Slavs.\r\nBut these \"reforms\" had nevertheless salutary effects upon the nation\r\nof peasants. The enlightened despots, spurred on by the loss of\r\nSilesia--which was at the same time a great loss in revenue as well as\r\nprestige--sought to make good the loss by the economic betterment and\r\neducation of the peasantry. How else could an agrarian state increase\r\nits revenue and supply able-bodied men for the numerous armies which\r\nthe overarmaments of Frederick II had brought upon central Europe?\r\n[FN: Emphasis on this fundamental fact of Habsburg history in the\r\neighteenth century cannot be too strong. The writer of this paper\r\nhopes soon to present archival proof of the far-reaching results of the\r\nseizure of Silesia. The documents are to be found in the archives of the\r\n_Hofkammer_ and _Ministerium des Innern_ in Vienna.] Centralization and\r\nGermanization really helped to awaken the Slavs. Enlightened despotism\r\ngave them the weapons of political struggle--education and economic\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nOf the Jugo-Slavs, the Serbs of Hungary were the first to achieve\r\nnational and cultural consciousness. In the absence of a native\r\nnobility, but with unusual economic opportunities at their command, they\r\ndeveloped a wealthy middle class--a rare thing among Slavs before the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century. This class came into contact with\r\nnationalized western Europe and found that the bulwark against national\r\noppression was education for the masses. The nation must be educated and\r\nmust be economically sound in order to undertake the political struggle\r\nagainst the Germans, the Magyars, and the Turks. That was the background\r\nof Dositej Obradovi[c]'s literary labors as he raised spoken\r\nSerbian ultimately to the literary language of the Jugo-Slavs and of\r\nKarad[z]i[c]'s efforts which resulted in that wonderful collection of\r\nSerbian national poems, and which clinched for all time the literary\r\nsupremacy of the _[S]to_ dialect. Serbian Hungary was the starting place\r\nfor Kara George's revolution which brought partial freedom in 1804 and\r\nautonomy in 1830 and thus planted the germ of the modern Greater Serbia.\r\nNapoleon's Illyria, created in 1809, joined for the first time Slovenes\r\nand Croats in one political unit, and the excellent administration and\r\nthe schools left an undying memory of what might be if the Habsburgs\r\ncared. Vodnik, the Slovene poet, sang of Illyria and her creator, but it\r\nwas the meteoric Croat, Ljudevit Gaj, in the thirties, who so eloquently\r\nidealized it as he poured heated rhetoric into the camp of the\r\nMagyars, who after the Diet of 1825 began their unfortunate policy\r\nof Magyarization. Illyria, though short-lived, became the germ of the\r\nGreater Croatia idea, which, with Greater Serbia, existed as the two,\r\nnot necessarily hostile, solutions of the Jugo-Slav problem down to the\r\nCongress of Berlin. It was as yet a friendly rivalry with the possible\r\nformation of two separate units. The occupation of Bosnia in 1878 led to\r\nactual friction between them. On the other hand, the annexation of the\r\nsame province in 1908 had just the opposite effect, for from that time\r\nthe ultimate ideal was no longer Greater Croatia or Greater Serbia in\r\nany selfish sense, but Jugo-slavia, because, to use a platitude, Bosnia\r\nhad scrambled the eggs. Evidence of the fairly amicable relations\r\nbetween Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs at the time of Gaj is not lacking.\r\nIt was Gaj who reformed Croatian orthography on the basis of the\r\nSerbian. Bleiweis and Vraz endeavored to do the same in Slovene.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of 1848 demonstrated still further the friendly relations\r\nof these potential rivals as national unifiers. For the first time,\r\nthe Croats and Serbs publicly fraternized and showed that the seemingly\r\ninsurmountable barrier of religious difference tended to disappear in\r\nthe struggle for national independence. In this sense the events of\r\n1848--when the hand of the foreign master was for the while taken\r\naway--have given confident hope to those who believe that Jugo-Slav\r\ndifferences are soluble. Jela[c]i[c], Ban of Croatia, the idol of the\r\nSerbo-Croats, was proclaimed dictator and supported by the Croatian Diet\r\nat Zagreb (Agram) and the Serbian assembly at Karlovac (Karlowitz). The\r\nSerb Patriarch Raja[c]i[c] and the young and gifted Stratimirovi[c],\r\nprovisional administrator of the Serb Vojvodina, attended the Croatian\r\nDiet and the High Mass where Bishop O[z]egovi[c] sang the Te Deum in Old\r\nSlavic. After Gaj, Raja[c]i[c], and Stratimirovi[c] had failed at Vienna\r\nand Pressburg to bend the dynasty or the defiant Kossuth, Jela[c]i[c]\r\nwas empowered to defend the monarchy and bring back the historical\r\nrights of the Triune Kingdom and the Serb Vojvodina. The dynasty and\r\nthe monarchy survived, but Jugo-Slav hopes and the promises they\r\nhad received were unfulfilled or soon withdrawn, as for instance the\r\nVojvodina in 1861. Absolutism reigned supreme from 1849 to 1860.\r\n\r\nThis disappointment led the Croats and Serbs to try cooperation with the\r\nMagyars, who under Deak and Eoetvoes appeared to be anxious to conciliate\r\nthe non-Magyars in those uncertain years which began in 1859 and ended\r\nin dualism. Austria lacked a great statesman, and the Prusso-Austrian\r\nrivalry led the fearful and impatient Francis Joseph into the Compromise\r\n(Ausgleich) of 1867. It was a work of haste and expediency and bound\r\nwith it the fate of the dynasty. Thereafter, the German minority in\r\nAustria and the Magyar minority in Hungary were the decisive factors\r\nin the problems confronting the Jugo-Slavs. Dalmatia was handed over to\r\nAustria; Croatia, by a compromise, which it has never really accepted,\r\nto Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe Ausgleich between Austria and Hungary and Hungary and Croatia opened\r\nin 1868 a period which ended in 1905--it was a period, on the one hand\r\nof the greatest decay and decomposition in the political life of the\r\nJugo-Slavs, and, on the other, of the greatest literary and intellectual\r\nunity as shaped by Bishop Strossmayer and Peter II and Nicholas of\r\nMontenegro.\r\n\r\nBishop Strossmayer and the Slovene, Croat, and Serb academies, matica,\r\nand learned societies, as well as men of literature, spoke, wrote, and\r\npleaded for unity in this period, in vain. But they and the universities\r\nof Prague and Zagreb produced a younger generation which later took up\r\nthe fight for national unity and which abandoned individual political\r\nfoibles and looked over the boundaries of their provinces for\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nAmong the Slovenes, politics degenerated into the struggle for minor\r\nconcessions from the court at Vienna in regard to the Slovene language\r\nand schools, while political parties multiplied freely through personal\r\nand social differences. The lines which bound them to their kinsmen in\r\nthe south were weakest during this period.\r\n\r\nThe Croats found themselves no match for the astute Magyars who resorted\r\nto packed diets, gerrymandering, bribery, and forgery. The Compromise\r\n(Nagoda) of 1868 was as decisive as the murder of the farsighted Prince\r\nMichael of Serbia in that year. It will be remembered that, in spite\r\nof his many faults, he had made an agreement with Montenegro for\r\nthe ultimate merging of their states and, after allying himself with\r\nRumania, had carried out an agreement with the Bulgarian committee for\r\nthe amalgamation of Bulgaria with Serbia, thus obtaining a commanding\r\ninfluence in the Balkans. With his death, Serbia fell into the hands of\r\nMilan and Alexander, whose weak and erratically despotic reigns ushered\r\nin an era in Serbian history from which she emerged in 1903, through\r\nthe assassination and the extinction of the last of the Obrenovics, a\r\ncountry without a good name, a nation which, through no special fault of\r\nits own, had become degraded.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this political decay that the Bosnians revolted\r\nin 1875 and that Serbia, Montenegro, Russia, and Rumania became involved\r\nin the Russo-Turkish war. Space forbids but the most hasty survey of the\r\noccupation and administration by Austria of Bosnia and the Herzegovina\r\nby virtue of the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.\r\n\r\nBismarck, Francis Joseph, and Andrassy were swayed by differing motives\r\nwhose total result was that Austria was to become a Balkan power--the\r\noutpost of the German _Drang nach Osten_--and that it was worth while\r\nmaking a greater Serbia impossible, even at the cost of increasing the\r\nnumber of Slavs in the Habsburg monarchy, which, now reenforced by\r\nthe Ausgleich, could stand the strain of advancing democracy and the\r\nnecessity, therefore, of granting further rights to the Slavs.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Bosnia led to the first real quarrels in modern times\r\nbetween Croat and Serb, for the former wanted Bosnia in Greater Croatia\r\nin order to have connection with Dalmatia; the latter wished it annexed\r\nto Greater Serbia, because it was Serbian. Magyar and German, further,\r\nquarreled as to the status of Bosnia and left it unsettled. But one\r\nthing was settled by the occupation in 1879 and the annexation in\r\n1908. Neither Greater Croatia nor Greater Serbia were any longer truly\r\npossible as a final solution, only a Jugo-Slavia. The Greater Croatia\r\nreceived a mortal blow by the addition of Serbs up to more than one\r\nthird of the number of Croats in Austria-Hungary, and Serbia faced the\r\nfuture either as a vassal or as a territory which must be annexed. From\r\nthat time until the present the Habsburg monarchy, largely owing to\r\nthe predominance of the Magyars in Croatia, adopted a policy of\r\nprevention--Jugo-Slav nationality was to be prevented. Viewed in that\r\nlight the rule of Count Khuen-Hederv[a]ry, Ban of Croatia from 1883\r\nto 1903, in which time, according to Croats, he corrupted a whole\r\ngeneration, turned Serb against Croat, and played out the radical\r\ndemands of the party of Star[c]evi[c] and Frank, is intelligible. The\r\npolicy of Count Khuen, which was based on corruption and forgery, on\r\npress-muzzling and career-exploding, has since been imitated, and its\r\nimitation has been largely responsible for this war.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the Serbs and Croats formed their coalition in 1905\r\nthat the trial of strength had come. In Serbia, Peter Karageorgevitch\r\nascended the throne and reversed the pro-Austrian policy of his\r\npredecessor. This it will be remembered was influenced until then by\r\nthe Bulgarian policy of Russia and by Serbia's defeat at the hands of\r\nBulgaria in 1885. The commercial treaty with Bulgaria in 1905, and the\r\ntariff war which Austria began immediately afterward, pointed out which\r\nway the wind was blowing.\r\n\r\nAn era big with decisive events arrived. The Jugo-Slavs had learned\r\nthat union meant victory, division foreign mastery. Petty politics\r\nand religious fanaticism were forgotten, and Jugo-Slav nationality was\r\nformed in the fierce fires of Austro-Magyar terrorism and forgery and in\r\nthe whirlwind reaped from the Balkan wars.\r\n\r\nIt was too late to talk of trialism unless it meant independence, and,\r\nwhen it meant that, it did not mean Austrian trialism. The treason trial\r\nby which Baron Rauch hoped to split the Serbo-Croat coalition, and\r\nwhich was to furnish the cause of a war with Serbia on the annexation of\r\nBosnia in 1908, collapsed. It rested on forgeries concocted within the\r\nwalls of the Austro-Hungarian legation in Belgrade where Count Forgach\r\nheld forth. The annexation of Bosnia in 1908 completed the operation\r\nbegun in 1878 and called for the completion of the policy of prevention.\r\nIt was the forerunner of the press campaign in the first Balkan war,\r\nthe Prohaska affair, the attack by Bulgaria upon Serbia and Greece, the\r\nrebuff to Masaryk and Pa[s]i[c], the murder of Francis Ferdinand, and\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian note to Serbia. The mysteries connected with the\r\nforgeries and this chain of events will remain a fertile field for\r\ndetectives and psychologists and, after that, for historians. For us,\r\nit is necessary to note that, as the hand of Pan-Germanism became more\r\nevident, the Slovenes began to draw nearer to the Croats and the Serbs.\r\nIt remained only for the Serbs to electrify the Jugo-Slavs--\"to\r\navenge Kossovo with Kumanovo\"--in order to cement their loyalty to\r\nthe regenerated Serbs. Religious differences, political rivalries,\r\nlinguistic quibbles, and the petty foibles of centuries appeared to be\r\nforgotten in the three short years which elapsed from Kumanovo to\r\nthe destruction of Serbia in 1915. The Greater Serbia idea had really\r\nperished in 1915, as had the Greater Croatia idea in 1878. In their\r\nplace emerged Jugo-Slavia--the kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and\r\nSlovenes--implied by the South Slav Parliamentary Club in Austria in\r\ntheir Declaration of May 30, 1917, and formulated by the Pact of Corfu\r\nof July 7, 1917, which Pasie, premier of Serbia, and Trumbie, the head\r\nof the London Jugo-Slav Committee, drew up. The evolution had been\r\ncompleted. Nationalism had proved stronger than geography, stronger than\r\nopposing religions, more cohesive than political and economic interests.\r\nFor this, the Jugo-Slavs have not only themselves and modern progress,\r\nlike railroad-building, to thank, but also the policy of the Habsburg\r\nmonarchy, the hopeful, though feeble, Note of the Allies to President\r\nWilson, the Russian Revolution, and the entry of the United States into\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nFor the historian, it remains to examine the depth and the character of\r\nthe movement. He should neither lament that it succeeded, nor frown upon\r\nit that it did not come long ago when his own nation achieved its unity.\r\nThat it is a reality is proved by the fact that the Central Powers\r\nbelieved its destruction worth this catastrophic war. A nation of eleven\r\nor twelve millions holds the path to the Adriatic and the Aegean and the\r\ngateway to the Orient and world dominion. It can help to make impossible\r\nthe dream of mid-Europe or of Pan-Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Jugo-Slav movement has ended in the formation of a nation which is\r\nneither a doctrine, nor a dream, but a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES DECLARATION OF THE JUGO-SLAV CLUB OF THE AUSTRIAN PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nON MAY 30, 1917\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned deputies, assembled as the 'Jugo-slav Club,' taking\r\ntheir stand on the principle of nationalities and on the rights of the\r\nCroatian state, declare that they demand that all the countries in which\r\nSlovenes, Croats, and Serbs live shall be united in an independent\r\nand democratic state organism, free from the domination of any foreign\r\nnation and placed under the sceptre of the dynasty Habsburg-Lorraine.\r\nThey declare that they will employ all their forces to realize this\r\ndemand of their single nation.

J. Grgurevich,\r\n     Secretary of the South Slavic National Council, Washington,\r\n     D. C., writes:\r\n\r\n     \"In order to understand correctly this Declaration, it is\r\n     necessary to state that the same was presented in the Vienna\r\n     Parliament during war time, when each, even the most\r\n     innocent, word in regard to rights, principles of\r\n     nationality, and liberty of peoples, was considered and\r\n     punished as a crime and treason, by imprisonment, even\r\n     death.\r\n\r\n     \"Were it not for these facts, this Declaration would never\r\n     contain the words: 'and placed under the sceptre of the\r\n     dynasty Habsburg-Lorraine.' It was, therefore, necessary to\r\n     insert these words in order to make possible the public\r\n     announcement of this Declaration; it was necessary to make a\r\n     moral sacrifice for the sake of a great moral and material\r\n     gain, which was secured through this Declaration among the\r\n     people to which it was addressed and which understood it in\r\n     the sense and in the spirit of the Declaration of Corfu.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nTHE PACT OF CORFU\r\n\r\nAt the conference of the members of the late (Serbian) Coalition Cabinet\r\nand those of the present Cabinet, and also the representatives of the\r\nJugo-Slav Committee in London, all of whom have hitherto been working\r\non parallel lines, views have been exchanged in collaboration with the\r\npresident of the Skupstina, on all questions concerning the life of the\r\nSerbs, Croats and Slovenes in their joint future State.\r\n\r\nWe are happy in being able once more on this occasion to point to the\r\ncomplete unanimity of all parties concerned.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the representatives of the Serbs, Croats and\r\nSlovenes declare anew and most categorically that our people constitutes\r\nbut one nation, and that it is one in blood, one by the spoken and\r\nwritten language, by the continuity and unity of the territory in which\r\nit lives, and finally in virtue of the common and vital interests of its\r\nnational existence and the general development of its moral and material\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe idea of its national unity has never suffered extinction, although\r\nall the intellectual forces of its enemy were directed against its\r\nunification, its liberty and its national existence. Divided between\r\nseveral States, our nation is in Austria-Hungary alone split up into\r\neleven provincial administrations, coming under thirteen legislative\r\nbodies. The feeling of national unity, together with the spirit\r\nof liberty and independence, have supported it in the never-ending\r\nstruggles of centuries against the Turks in the East and against the\r\nGermans and the Magyars in the West.\r\n\r\nBeing numerically inferior to its enemies in the East and West, it was\r\nimpossible for it to safeguard its unity as a nation and a State, its\r\nliberty and its independence against the brutal maxim of \"might goes\r\nbefore right\" militating against it both East and West.\r\n\r\nBut the moment has come when our people is no longer isolated. The war\r\nimposed by German militarism upon Russia, upon France and upon\r\nEngland for the defense of their honor as well as for the liberty and\r\nindependence of small nations, has developed into a struggle for the\r\nLiberty of the World and the Triumph of Right over Might. All nations\r\nwhich love liberty and independence have allied themselves together for\r\ntheir common defense, to save civilization and liberty at the cost\r\nof every sacrifice, to establish a new international order based upon\r\njustice and upon the right of every nation to dispose of itself and\r\nso organize its independent life; finally to establish a durable peace\r\nconsecrated to the progress and development of humanity and to secure\r\nthe world against a catastrophe similar to that which the conquering\r\nlust of German Imperialism has provoked.\r\n\r\nTo noble France, who has proclaimed the liberty of nations, and to\r\nEngland, the hearth of liberty, the Great American Republic and the\r\nnew, free and democratic Russia have joined themselves in proclaiming\r\nas their principal war aim the triumph of liberty and democracy and\r\nas basis of the new international order the right of free\r\nself-determination for every nation.\r\n\r\nOur nation of the three names, which has been the greatest sufferer\r\nunder brute force and injustice and which has made the greatest\r\nsacrifices to preserve its right of self-determination, has with\r\nenthusiasm accepted this sublime principle put forward as the chief aim\r\nof this atrocious war, provoked by the violation of this very principle.\r\n\r\nThe authorized representatives of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, in\r\ndeclaring that it is the desire of our people to free itself from every\r\nforeign yoke and to constitute itself a free, national and independent\r\nState, a desire based on the principle that every nation has the right\r\nto decide its own destiny, are agreed in judging that this State should\r\nbe founded on the following modern and democratic principles:\r\n\r\n(1) The State of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, who are also known\r\nas the Southern Slavs or Jugo-Slavs, will be a free and independent\r\nkingdom, with indivisible territory and unity of allegiance. It will\r\nbe a constitutional, democratic and parliamentary monarchy under the\r\nKarageorgevitch Dynasty, which has always shared the ideas and the\r\nfeelings of the nation, placing liberty and the national will above all\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n(2) This State will be named \"THE KINGDOM OF THE SERBS, CROATS, AND\r\nSLOVENES.\" And the style of the Sovereign will be \"KING OF THE SERBS,\r\nCROATS, AND SLOVENES.\"\r\n\r\n(3) The State will have a single coat-of-arms, a single flag, and a\r\nsingle crown. These emblems will be composed of the present existing\r\nemblems. The unity of the State will be symbolized by the coat-of-arms\r\nand the flag of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\n(4) The special Serb, Croat, and Slovene flags rank equally and may be\r\nfreely hoisted on all occasions. The special coat-of-arms may be used\r\nwith equal freedom.\r\n\r\n(5) The three national designations--Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes--are\r\nequal before the law throughout the territory of the Kingdom, and\r\neveryone may use them freely upon all occasions of public life and in\r\ndealing with the authorities.\r\n\r\n(6) The two alphabets, the Cyrillic and the Latin, also rank equally,\r\nand everyone may use them freely throughout the territory of the\r\nKingdom. The royal authorities and the local self-governing authorities\r\nhave both the right and the duty to employ both alphabets in accordance\r\nwith the wishes of the citizens.\r\n\r\n(7) All recognized religions may be freely and publicly exercised. The\r\nOrthodox, Roman Catholic and Mussulman faiths, which are those chiefly\r\nprofessed by our nation, shall rank equally and enjoy equal rights with\r\nregard to the State.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of these principles the legislative will take special\r\ncare to safeguard religious concord in conformity with the spirit and\r\ntradition of our whole nation.\r\n\r\n(8) The calendar will be unified as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n(9) The territory of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\r\nwill include all the territory inhabited compactly and in territorial\r\ncontinuity by our nation of the three names. It cannot be mutilated\r\nwithout detriment to the vital interests of the community.\r\n\r\nOur nation demands nothing that belongs to others. It demands only\r\nwhat is its own. It desires to free itself and to achieve its unity.\r\nTherefore it consciously and firmly refuses every partial solution of\r\nthe problem of its national liberation and unification. It puts forward\r\nthe proposition of its deliverance from Austro-Hungarian domination\r\nand its union with Serbia and Montenegro in a single State forming an\r\nindivisible whole.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the right of self-determination of peoples, no part\r\nof this territorial totality may without infringement of justice be\r\ndetached and incorporated with some other State without the consent of\r\nthe nation itself.\r\n\r\n(10) In the interests of freedom and of the equal right of all nations,\r\nthe Adriatic shall be free and open to each and all.\r\n\r\n(11) All citizens throughout the territory of the Kingdom shall be equal\r\nand enjoy the same rights with regard to the State and before the Law.\r\n\r\n(12) The election of the Deputies to the National Representative body\r\nshall be by universal suffrage, with equal, direct and secret ballot.\r\nThe same shall apply to the elections in the Communes and other\r\nadministrative units. Elections will take place in each Commune.\r\n\r\n(13) The Constitution, to be established after the conclusion of peace\r\nby a Constituent Assembly elected by universal suffrage, with direct\r\nand secret ballot, will be the basis of the entire life of the State;\r\nit will be the source and the consummation of all authority and of all\r\nrights by which the entire life of the nation will be regulated.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution will provide the nation with the possibility of\r\nexercising its special energies in local autonomies delimited by\r\nnatural, social and economic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution must be passed in its entirety by a numerically defined\r\nmajority in the Constituent Assembly. The Constitution, like all other\r\nlaws passed by the Constituent Assembly, will only come into force after\r\nhaving received the Royal sanction.\r\n\r\nThe nation of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, thus unified, will form\r\na State of about twelve million inhabitants. This State will be the\r\nguarantee for their independence and national development, and their\r\nnational and intellectual progress in general, a mighty bulwark against\r\nthe German thrust, an inseparable ally of all the civilized nations and\r\nstates which have proclaimed the principle of right and liberty and\r\nthat of international justice. It will be a worthy member of the new\r\nCommunity of Nations.\r\n\r\nDrawn up in Corfu, July 7/20, 1917.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Serbia and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs\r\n\r\n(Sgd.)

The noted\r\nFrench historian, to whom the western world owes much of its knowledge\r\nabout Slavic history, Ernest Denis, presents an able survey of the\r\ngeneral problem in his _La grande Serbie_ (Paris, 1915). It is written\r\nlargely around Serbia, like Savi[c]'s book. B. Vo[s]njak in _A Bulwark\r\nagainst Germany_ (London, 1917), and _A Dying Empire_ (London, 1918),\r\npresents to western readers, for the first time, the development of the\r\nSlovene districts of Austria and their relation to that empire and to\r\nthe Jugo-Slavs.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Austria-Hungary and the Jugo-Slavs in particular, the\r\nwest owes most to the penetrating studies of R. W. Seton-Watson,\r\nwho formerly wrote under the name of Scotus Viator. Before the war,\r\nSeton-Watson wrote _The Southern Slav Problem and the Habsburg Monarchy_\r\n(London, 1911), wherein he discusses the whole problem from the point\r\nof view of the Croats, in contrast to the Serbs. The author subsequently\r\nrectified this point of view in _The Balkans, Italy, and the Adriatic_\r\n(London, 1915); _German, Slav, and Magyar_ (London, 1916); and _The Rise\r\nof Nationality in the Balkans_ (London, 1917).\r\n\r\nNumerous writers on Austrian and Balkan affairs have devoted parts of\r\ntheir general works to the Jugo-Slav movement. Only a few typical\r\nones can be mentioned here. Paul Samassa, _Der Voelkerstreit im\r\nHabsburgerstaat_ (Leipzig, 1910), may be taken as representative of\r\nthe German of the German Empire. T. von Sosnosky's _Die Politik\r\nim Habsburgerreiche_ (Berlin, 1912-13, 2 vols.) is the work of an\r\nAustrophil, as is also W. von Schierbrand's _Austria-Hungary: The\r\nPolyglot Empire_ (New York, 1917); H. W. Steed's _The Habsburg Monarchy_\r\n(London, 1914, 2d ed.) is one of the ablest surveys in the English\r\nlanguage. It is thoroughly worked out in the general features, but\r\nslights many of the national and provincial aspects of the Austrian\r\nquestion. V. Gayda's _La crisi di un impero_ (2d ed., 1915), English\r\ned., _Modern Austria_ (New York, 1915) is an unusually able work by\r\nan Italian who sees clearly on every question except that of Italia\r\nIrredenta. A. Toynbee's _Nationality and the War_ (London, 1915)\r\nis another very useful summary of the question. The official\r\nAustro-Hungarian point of view has been stated in such works, among many\r\nothers, as Hitter von Sax, _Die Wahrheit ueber die serbische Frage und\r\ndas Serbentum in Bosnien_ (Vienna, 1909); L. Mandl, _Oesterreich-Ungarn\r\nund Serbien_ (Vienna, 1911); C. M. Knachtbull-Hugessen, _The Political\r\nEvolution of the Hungarian Nation_ (London, 1908, 2 vols.); and numerous\r\nofficial publications and dossiers.\r\n\r\nThe works thus far mentioned were based on numerous studies in Slavic\r\nand other languages, only a few of which can be mentioned here.\r\n\r\nFor the Slovenes one will look into Josef Apih's _Slovenci in 1848 leto_\r\n(Lubla[n], 1888); Lon[c]ar's _Politi[c]no [z]ivljenje Slovencei_ (in\r\nBleiweis's _Zbornik._ Published by the Matica Slovenska, Lubla[n],\r\n1909); and Vos[n]jak's _Spomini_ (Lubla[n], 1906, 2 vols.).\r\n\r\nThe following will be found useful for the Croats: V. Klai[c], _Povjest\r\nHrvata_ (Zagreb, 1899 ff., 5 vols.); R. Horvat, _Najnovije doba\r\nhrvatske povjesti_ (Zagreb, 1906); Milan Marjanovi[c], _Hrvatski\r\npokret_ (Dubrovnik, 1903-04, 2 vols.); L. V. Berezin, _Khorvatsi[ia],\r\nSlavoni[ia], Dalmatsi[ia] i Voenna[ia] Granitsa_ (St. Petersburg, 1879);\r\nI. Kulakovski[i], _Illirizm_ (Warsaw, 1894); T. Smi[c]iklas, _Hrvatska\r\nnarodna ideja_ (Rad Jugo-Slavenski Akad. 1xxx); V. Zagorsky, _Francois\r\nRa[c]ki et la renaissance scientifique et politique de la Croatie\r\n1828-1894_ (Paris, 1909).\r\n\r\nFor the Serbs, a few of the fundamental works are: L. Kova[c]evi[c] and\r\nL. Jovanovi[c], _Istorija srpskoga naroda _(Belgrade, 1893-94, 2\r\nvols.); S. Stanojevi[c], _Istorija srpskoga naroda_ (Belgrade, 1908); J.\r\nRisti[c], _Diplomatska istorija srbije, 1875-1878_ (Belgrade, 1896-98);\r\nV. V. Ra[c]i[c], _Le royaume de Serbie. Etude d'histoire diplomatique\r\net de droit international_ (Paris, 1901); F. P. Kanitz, _Das Koenigreich\r\nSerbien und das Serbenvolk von der Roemerzeit bis zur Gegenwart_\r\n(Leipzig, 1904-09, 2 vols.); S. Gop[c]evi[c], _Geschichte von Montenegro\r\nund Albanien_ (Gotha, 1914); F. S. Stevenson, _A History of Montenegro_\r\n(London, 1912).[FN: Lack of space forbids special mention of\r\nworks by such scholars as Loiseau, Vellay, Laveleye, Hron, Masaryk,\r\nSpalajkovi[c], Barre, [FN (cont.): Kallay, Marczali, Prezzolini,\r\nSokolovi[c], Novakovi[c], Cheradame, Evans, Erdeljanovi[c].\r\n\r\nThe Jugo-Slav propaganda societies have published in English: _The\r\nSouthern Slav Appeal; Jugo-Slav Nationalism_ by B. Vo[s]njak; _The\r\nStrategical Significance of Serbia_ by N. Zupani[c]; _The Southern Slav\r\nProgramme; A Sketch of Southern Slav History; Southern Slav Culture;\r\nPolitical and Social Conditions in Slovene Lands; Austro-Magyar Judicial\r\nCrimes--Persecutions of the Jugo-Slavs._ In French: _Ceux dont on ignore\r\nle martyre (Les Yougo-Slaves et la guerre)_; _Les Yougo-Slaves--Leur\r\nunion nationale; Les Slovenes_ by Q. Krek; and the periodical _Bulletin\r\nYougoslave_.\r\n\r\nH. Hinkovi[c] has written the most concise statement of the case of the\r\nJugo-Slavs in _The Jugo-Slav Problem_. Reprinted from the _World Court\r\nMagazine_ (1917).]\r\n\r\nThere is a good survey of the history of the Jugo-Slavs in Russian: G.\r\nIl'inski[i], _Kratk'i[i] kurs istori[i] [iu]zhnikh slav[ia]n_ (Kharkov,\r\n1909).",
