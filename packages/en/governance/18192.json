We have weighed and considered this\r\nmaturely. We have compared exactly the time with the matter, and we have\r\nfound that we are obliged to do as all men must do who would manage\r\ntheir affairs practicably, to make our opinion of what might be most\r\nadvantageous to the business conform to the time that is left to perform\r\nit in. We must, as all men must, submit affairs to time, and not think\r\nof making time conform to our wishes; and therefore, my Lords, I very\r\nwillingly fall in with the inclinations of the gentlemen with whom I\r\nhave the honor to act, to come as soon as possible to close fighting,\r\nand to grapple immediately and directly with the corruptions of\r\nIndia,--to bring before your Lordships the direct articles, to apply the\r\nevidence to the articles, and to bring the matter forward for your\r\nLordships' decision in that manner which the confidence we have in the\r\njustice of our cause demands from the Commons of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, these are the opinions of those with whom I have the honor to\r\nact, and in their opinions I readily acquiesce. For I am far from\r\nwishing to waste any of your Lordships' time upon any matter merely\r\nthrough any opinion I have of the nature of the business, when at the\r\nsame time I find that in the opinion of others it might militate against\r\nthe production of its full, proper, and (if I may so say) its immediate\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIt was my design to class the crimes of the late Governor of Bengal,--to\r\nshow their mutual bearings,--how they were mutually aided and grew and\r\nwere formed out of each other. I proposed first of all to show your\r\nLordships that they have their root in that which is the origin of all\r\nevil, avarice and rapacity,--to show how that led to prodigality of the\r\npublic money,--and how prodigality of the public money, by wasting the\r\ntreasures of the East India Company, furnished an excuse to the\r\nGovernor-General to break its faith, to violate all its most solemn\r\nengagements, and to fall with a hand of stern, ferocious, and\r\nunrelenting rapacity upon all the allies and dependencies of the\r\nCompany. But I shall be obliged in some measure to abridge this plan;\r\nand as your Lordships already possess, from what I had the honor to\r\nstate on Saturday, a general view of this matter, you will be in a\r\ncondition to pursue it when the several articles are presented.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have to state to-day the root of all these\r\nmisdemeanors,--namely, the pecuniary corruption and avarice which gave\r\nrise and primary motion to all the rest of the delinquencies charged to\r\nbe committed by the Governor-General.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, pecuniary corruption forms not only, as your Lordships will\r\nobserve in the charges before you, an article of charge by itself, but\r\nlikewise so intermixes with the whole, that it is necessary to give, in\r\nthe best manner I am able, a history of that corrupt system which\r\nbrought on all the subsequent acts of corruption. I will venture to say\r\nthere is no one act, in which tyranny, malice, cruelty, and oppression\r\ncan be charged, that does not at the same time carry evident marks of\r\npecuniary corruption.\r\n\r\nI stated to your Lordships on Saturday last the principles upon which\r\nMr. Hastings governed his conduct in India, and upon which he grounds\r\nhis defence. These may all be reduced to one short word,--_arbitrary\r\npower_. My Lords, if Mr. Hastings had contended, as other men have often\r\ndone, that the system of government which he patronizes, and on which he\r\nacted, was a system tending on the whole to the blessing and benefit of\r\nmankind, possibly something might be said for him for setting up so\r\nwild, absurd, irrational, and wicked a system,--something might be said\r\nto qualify the act from the intention; but it is singular in this man,\r\nthat, at the time he tells you he acted on the principles of arbitrary\r\npower, he takes care to inform you that he was not blind to the\r\nconsequences. Mr. Hastings foresaw that the consequences of this system\r\nwas corruption. An arbitrary system, indeed, must always be a corrupt\r\none. My Lords, there never was a man who thought he had no law but his\r\nown will, who did not soon find that he had no end but his own profit.\r\nCorruption and arbitrary power are of natural unequivocal generation,\r\nnecessarily producing one another. Mr. Hastings foresees the abusive and\r\ncorrupt consequences, and then he justifies his conduct upon the\r\nnecessities of that system. These are things which are new in the world;\r\nfor there never was a man, I believe, who contended for arbitrary power,\r\n(and there have been persons wicked and foolish enough to contend for\r\nit,) that did not pretend, either that the system was good in itself, or\r\nthat by their conduct they had mitigated or had purified it, and that\r\nthe poison, by passing through their constitution, had acquired salutary\r\nproperties. But if you look at his defence before the House of Commons,\r\nyou will see that that very system upon which he governed, and under\r\nwhich he now justifies his actions, did appear to himself a system\r\npregnant with a thousand evils and a thousand mischiefs.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that is remarkable and singular in the principles upon\r\nwhich the Governor-General acted is, that, when he is engaged in a\r\nvicious system which clearly leads to evil consequences, he thinks\r\nhimself bound to realize all the evil consequences involved in that\r\nsystem. All other men have taken a directly contrary course: they have\r\nsaid, \"I have been engaged in an evil system, that led, indeed, to\r\nmischievous consequences, but I have taken care, by my own virtues, to\r\nprevent the evils of the system under which I acted.\"\r\n\r\nWe say, then, not only that he governed arbitrarily, but\r\ncorruptly,--that is to say, that he was a giver and receiver of bribes,\r\nand formed a system for the purpose of giving and receiving them. We\r\nwish your Lordships distinctly to consider that he did not only give and\r\nreceive bribes accidentally, as it happened, without any system and\r\ndesign, merely as the opportunity or momentary temptation of profit\r\nurged him to it, but that he has formed plans and systems of government\r\nfor the very purpose of accumulating bribes and presents to himself.\r\nThis system of Mr. Hastings's government is such a one, I believe, as\r\nthe British nation in particular will disown; for I will venture to say,\r\nthat, if there is any one thing which distinguishes this nation\r\neminently above another, it is, that in its offices at home, both\r\njudicial and in the state, there is less suspicion of pecuniary\r\ncorruption attaching to them than to any similar offices in any part of\r\nthe globe, or that have existed at any time: so that he who would set up\r\na system of corruption, and attempt to justify it upon the principle of\r\nutility, that man is staining not only the nature and character of\r\noffice, but that which is the peculiar glory of the official and\r\njudicial character of this country; and therefore, in this House, which\r\nis eminently the guardian of the purity of all the offices of this\r\nkingdom, he ought to be called eminently and peculiarly to account.\r\nThere are many things, undoubtedly, in crimes, which make them frightful\r\nand odious; but bribery, filthy hands, a chief governor of a great\r\nempire receiving bribes from poor, miserable, indigent people, this is\r\nwhat makes government itself base, contemptible, and odious in the eyes\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, it is certain that even tyranny itself may find some specious\r\ncolor, and appear as a more severe and rigid execution of justice.\r\nReligious persecution may shield itself under the guise of a mistaken\r\nand over-zealous piety. Conquest may cover its baldness with its own\r\nlaurels, and the ambition of the conqueror may be hid in the secrets of\r\nhis own heart under a veil of benevolence, and make him imagine he is\r\nbringing temporary desolation upon a country only to promote its\r\nultimate advantage and his own glory. But in the principles of that\r\ngovernor who makes nothing but money his object there can be nothing of\r\nthis. There are here none of those specious delusions that look like\r\nvirtues, to veil either the governed or the governor. If you look at Mr.\r\nHastings's merits, as he calls them, what are they? Did he improve the\r\ninternal state of the government by great reforms? No such thing. Or by\r\na wise and incorrupt administration of justice? No. Has he enlarged the\r\nboundary of our government? No: there are but too strong proofs of his\r\nlessening it. But his pretensions to merit are, that he squeezed more\r\nmoney out of the inhabitants of the country than other persons could\r\nhave done,--money got by oppression, violence, extortion from the poor,\r\nor the heavy hand of power upon the rich and great.\r\n\r\nThese are his merits. What we charge as his demerits are all of the same\r\nnature; for, though there is undoubtedly oppression, breach of faith,\r\ncruelty, perfidy, charged upon him, yet the great ruling principle of\r\nthe whole, and that from which you can never have an act free, is\r\nmoney,--it is the vice of base avarice, which never is, nor ever appears\r\neven to the prejudices of mankind to be, anything like a virtue. Our\r\ndesire of acquiring sovereignty in India undoubtedly originated first in\r\nideas of safety and necessity; its next step was a step of ambition.\r\nThat ambition, as generally happens in conquest, was followed by gains\r\nof money; but afterwards there was no mixture at all; it was, during Mr.\r\nHastings's time, altogether a business of money. If he has extirpated a\r\nnation, I will not say whether properly or improperly, it is because\r\n(says he) you have all the benefit of conquest without expense; you have\r\ngot a large sum of money from the people, and you may leave them to be\r\ngoverned by whom and as they will. This is directly contrary to the\r\nprinciples of conquerors. If he has at any time taken any money from the\r\ndependencies of the Company, he does not pretend that it was obtained\r\nfrom their zeal and affection to our cause, or that it made their\r\nsubmission more complete: very far from it. He says they ought to be\r\nindependent, and all that you have to do is to squeeze money from them.\r\nIn short, money is the beginning, the middle, and the end of every kind\r\nof act done by Mr. Hastings: pretendedly for the Company, but really for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHaving said so much about the origin, the first principle, both of that\r\nwhich he makes his merit and which we charge as his demerit, the next\r\nstep is, that I should lay open to your Lordships, as clearly as I can,\r\nwhat the sense of his employers, the East India Company, and what the\r\nsense of the legislature itself, has been upon those merits and demerits\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the Company, knowing that these money transactions were likely\r\nto subvert that empire which was first established upon them, did, in\r\nthe year 1765, send out a body of the strongest and most solemn\r\ncovenants to their servants, that they should take no presents from the\r\ncountry powers, under any name or description, except those things which\r\nwere publicly and openly taken for the use of the Company,--namely,\r\n_territories_ or _sums of money_ which might be obtained by treaty. They\r\ndistinguished such presents as were taken from any persons privately,\r\nand unknown to them, and without their authority, from subsidies: and\r\nthat this is the true nature and construction of their order I shall\r\ncontend and explain afterwards to your Lordships. They have said,\r\nnothing shall be taken for their private use; for though in that and in\r\nevery state there may be subsidiary treaties by which sums of money may\r\nbe received, yet they forbid their servants, their governors, whatever\r\napplication they might pretend to make of them, to receive, under any\r\nother name or pretence, more than a certain, marked, simple sum of\r\nmoney, and this not without the consent and permission of the Presidency\r\nto which they belong. This is the substance, the principle, and the\r\nspirit of the covenants, and will show your Lordships how radicated an\r\nevil this of bribery and presents was judged to be.\r\n\r\nWhen these covenants arrived in India, the servants refused at first to\r\nexecute them,--and suspended the execution of them, till they had\r\nenriched themselves with presents. Eleven months elapsed, and it was not\r\ntill Lord Clive reached the place of his destination that the covenants\r\nwere executed: and they were not executed then without some degree of\r\nforce. Soon afterwards the treaty was made with the country powers by\r\nwhich Sujah ul Dowlah was reëstablished in the province of Oude, and\r\npaid a sum of 500,000_l._ to the Company for it. It was a public\r\npayment, and there was not a suspicion that a single shilling of private\r\nemolument attended it. But whether Mr. Hastings had the example of\r\nothers or not, their example could not justify his briberies. He was\r\nsent there to put an end to all those examples. The Company did\r\nexpressly vest him with that power. They declared at that time, that the\r\nwhole of their service was totally corrupted by bribes and presents, and\r\nby extravagance and luxury, which partly gave rise to them, and these,\r\nin their turn, enabled them to pursue those excesses. They not only\r\nreposed trust in the integrity of Mr. Hastings, but reposed trust in his\r\nremarkable frugality and order in his affairs, which they considered as\r\nthings that distinguished his character. But in his defence we have him\r\nquite in another character,--no longer the frugal, attentive servant,\r\nbred to business, bred to book-keeping, as all the Company's servants\r\nare; he now knows nothing of his own affairs, knows not whether he is\r\nrich or poor, knows not what he has in the world. Nay, people are\r\nbrought forward to say that they know better than he does what his\r\naffairs are. He is not like a careful man bred in a counting-house, and\r\nby the Directors put into an office of the highest trust on account of\r\nthe regularity of his affairs; he is like one buried in the\r\ncontemplation of the stars, and knows nothing of the things in this\r\nworld. It was, then, on account of an idea of his great integrity that\r\nthe Company put him into this situation. Since that he has thought\r\nproper to justify himself, not by clearing himself of receiving bribes,\r\nbut by saying that no bad consequences resulted from it, and that, if\r\nany such evil consequences did arise from it, they arose rather from his\r\ninattention to money than from his desire of acquiring it.\r\n\r\nI have stated to your Lordships the nature of the covenants which the\r\nEast India Company sent out. Afterwards, when they found their servants\r\nhad refused to execute these covenants, they not only very severely\r\nreprehended even a moment's delay in their execution, and threatened the\r\nexacting the most strict and rigorous performance of them, but they sent\r\na commission to enforce the observance of them more strongly; and that\r\ncommission had it specially in charge never to receive presents. They\r\nnever sent out a person to India without recognizing the grievance, and\r\nwithout ordering that presents should not be received, as the main\r\nfundamental part of their duty, and upon which all the rest depended, as\r\nit certainly must: for persons at the head of government should not\r\nencourage that by example which they ought by precept, authority, and\r\nforce to restrain in all below them. That commission failing, another\r\ncommission was preparing to be sent out with the same instructions, when\r\nan act of Parliament took it up; and that act, which gave Mr. Hastings\r\npower, did mould in the very first stamina of his power this principle,\r\nin words the most clear and forcible that an act of Parliament could\r\npossibly devise upon the subject. And that act was made not only upon a\r\ngeneral knowledge of the grievance, but your Lordships will see in the\r\nreports of that time that Parliament had directly in view before them\r\nthe whole of that monstrous head of corruption under the name of\r\npresents, and all the monstrous consequences that followed it.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, every office of trust, in its very nature, forbids the\r\nreceipt of bribes. But Mr. Hastings was forbidden it, first, by his\r\nofficial situation,--next, by covenant,--and lastly, by act of\r\nParliament: that is to say, by all the things that bind mankind, or that\r\ncan bind them,--first, moral obligation inherent in the duty of their\r\noffice,--next, the positive injunctions of the legislature of the\r\ncountry,--and lastly, a man's own private, particular, voluntary act and\r\ncovenant. These three, the great and only obligations that bind mankind,\r\nall united in the focus of this single point,--that they should take no\r\npresents.\r\n\r\nI am to mark to your Lordships, that this law and this covenant did\r\nconsider indirect ways of taking presents--taking them by others, and\r\nsuch like--directly in the very same light as they considered taking\r\nthem by themselves. It is perhaps a much more dangerous way; because it\r\nadds to the crime a false, prevaricating mode of concealing it, and\r\nmakes it much more mischievous by admitting others into the\r\nparticipation of it. Mr. Hastings has said, (and it is one of the\r\ngeneral complaints of Mr. Hastings,) that he is made answerable for the\r\nacts of other men. It is a thing inherent in the nature of his\r\nsituation. All those who enjoy a great superintending trust, which is to\r\nregulate the whole affairs of an empire, are responsible for the acts\r\nand conduct of other men, so far as they had anything to do with\r\nappointing them, or holding them in their places, or having any sort of\r\ninspection into their conduct. But when a Governor presumes to remove\r\nfrom their situations those persons whom the public authority and\r\nsanction of the Company have appointed, and obtrudes upon them by\r\nviolence other persons, superseding the orders of his masters, he\r\nbecomes doubly responsible for their conduct. If the persons he names\r\nshould be of notorious evil character and evil principles, and if this\r\nshould be perfectly known to himself, and of public notoriety to the\r\nrest of the world, then another strong responsibility attaches on him\r\nfor the acts of those persons.\r\n\r\nGovernors, we know very well, cannot with their own hands be continually\r\nreceiving bribes,--for then they must have as many hands as one of the\r\nidols in an Indian temple, in order to receive all the bribes which a\r\nGovernor-General may receive,--but they have them vicariously. As there\r\nare many offices, so he has had various officers for receiving and\r\ndistributing his bribes; he has a great many, some white and some black\r\nagents. The white men are loose and licentious; they are apt to have\r\nresentments, and to be bold in revenging them. The black men are very\r\nsecret and mysterious; they are not apt to have very quick resentments,\r\nthey have not the same liberty and boldness of language which\r\ncharacterize Europeans; and they have fears, too, for themselves, which\r\nmakes it more likely that they will conceal anything committed to them\r\nby Europeans. Therefore Mr. Hastings had his black agents, not one, two,\r\nthree, but many, disseminated through the country: no two of them,\r\nhardly, appear to be in the secret of any one bribe. He has had likewise\r\nhis white agents,--they were necessary,--a Mr. Larkins and a Mr.\r\nCroftes. Mr. Croftes was sub-treasurer, and Mr. Larkins\r\naccountant-general. These were the last persons of all others that\r\nshould have had anything to do with bribes; yet these were some of his\r\nagents in bribery. There are few instances, in comparison of the whole\r\nnumber of bribes, but there are some, where two men are in the secret of\r\nthe same bribe. Nay, it appears that there was one bribe divided into\r\ndifferent payments at different times,--that one part was committed to\r\none black secretary, another part to another black secretary. So that it\r\nis almost impossible to make up a complete body of all his bribery: you\r\nmay find the scattered limbs, some here and others there; and while you\r\nare employed in picking them up, he may escape entirely in a prosecution\r\nfor the whole.\r\n\r\nThe first act of his government in Bengal was the most bold and\r\nextraordinary that I believe ever entered into the head of any man,--I\r\nwill say, of any tyrant. It was no more or less than a general, almost\r\nexceptless confiscation, in time of profound peace, of all the landed\r\nproperty in Bengal, upon most extraordinary pretences. Strange as this\r\nmay appear, he did so confiscate it; he put it up to a pretended public,\r\nin reality to a private corrupt auction; and such favored landholders as\r\ncame to it were obliged to consider themselves as not any longer\r\nproprietors of the estates, but to recognize themselves as farmers under\r\ngovernment: and even those few that were permitted to remain on their\r\nestates had their payments raised at his arbitrary discretion; and the\r\nrest of the lands were given to farmers-general, appointed by him and\r\nhis committee, at a price fixed by the same arbitrary discretion.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to inform your Lordships that the revenues of Bengal\r\nare, for the most part, territorial revenues, great quit-rents issuing\r\nout of lands. I shall say nothing either of the nature of this property,\r\nof the rights of the people to it, or of the mode of exacting the rents,\r\ntill that great question of revenues, one of the greatest which we shall\r\nhave to lay before you, shall be brought before your Lordships\r\nparticularly and specially as an article of charge. I only mention it\r\nnow as an exemplification of the great principle of corruption which\r\nguided Mr. Hastings's conduct.\r\n\r\nWhen the ancient nobility, the great princes, (for such I may call\r\nthem,) a nobility, perhaps, as ancient as that of your Lordships, (and a\r\nmore truly noble body never existed in that character,)--my Lords, when\r\nall the nobility, some of whom have borne the rank and port of princes,\r\nall the gentry, all the freeholders of the country, had their estates in\r\nthat manner confiscated,--that is, either given to themselves to hold on\r\nthe footing of farmers, or totally confiscated,--when such an act of\r\ntyranny was done, no doubt some good was pretended. This confiscation\r\nwas made by Mr. Hastings, and the lands let to these farmers for five\r\nyears, upon an idea which always accompanies his acts of oppression, the\r\nidea of _moneyed merit_. He adopted this mode of confiscating the\r\nestates, and letting them to farmers, for the avowed purpose of seeing\r\nhow much it was possible to take out of them. Accordingly, he set them\r\nup to this wild and wicked auction, as it would have been, if it had\r\nbeen a real one,--corrupt and treacherous, as it was,--he set these\r\nlands up for the purpose of making that discovery, and pretended that\r\nthe discovery would yield a most amazing increase of rent. And for some\r\ntime it appeared so to do, till it came to the touchstone of experience;\r\nand then it was found that there was a defalcation from these monstrous\r\nraised revenues which were to cancel in the minds of the Directors the\r\nwickedness of so atrocious, flagitious, and horrid an act of treachery.\r\nAt the end of five years what do you think was the failure? No less than\r\n2,050,000_l._ Then a new source of corruption was opened,--that is, how\r\nto deal with the balances: for every man who had engaged in these\r\ntransactions was a debtor to government, and the remission of that debt\r\ndepended upon the discretion of the Governor-General. Then the persons\r\nwho were to settle the composition of that immense debt, who were to see\r\nhow much was recoverable and how much not, were able to favor, or to\r\nexact to the last shilling; and there never existed a doubt but that not\r\nonly upon the original cruel exaction, but upon the remission\r\nafterwards, immense gains were derived. This will account for the manner\r\nin which those stupendous fortunes which astonish the world have been\r\nmade. They have been made, first by a tyrannous exaction from the people\r\nwho were suffered to remain in possession of their own land as\r\nfarmers,--then by selling the rest to farmers at rents and under hopes\r\nwhich could never be realized, and then getting money for the relaxation\r\nof their debts. But whatever excuse, and however wicked, there might\r\nhave been for this wicked act, namely, that it carried upon the face of\r\nit some sort of appearance of public good,--that is to say, that sort of\r\npublic good which Mr. Hastings so often professed, of ruining the\r\ncountry for the benefit of the Company,--yet, in fact, this business of\r\nbalances is that _nidus_ in which have been nustled and bred and born\r\nall the corruptions of India, first by making extravagant demands, and\r\nafterwards by making corrupt relaxations of them.\r\n\r\nBesides this monstrous failure, in consequence of a miserable exaction\r\nby which more was attempted to be forced from the country than it was\r\ncapable of yielding, and this by way of experiment, when your Lordships\r\ncome to inquire who the farmers-general of the revenue were, you would\r\nnaturally expect to find them to be the men in the several countries who\r\nhad the most interest, the greatest wealth, the best knowledge of the\r\nrevenue and resources of the country in which they lived. Those would be\r\nthought the natural, proper farmers-general of each district. No such\r\nthing, my Lords. They are found in the body of people whom I have\r\nmentioned to your Lordships. They were almost all let to Calcutta\r\nbanians. Calcutta banians were the farmers of almost the whole. They\r\nsub-delegated to others, who sometimes had sub-delegates under them _ad\r\ninfinitum_. The whole formed a system together, through the succession\r\nof black tyrants scattered through the country, in which you at last\r\nfind the European at the end, sometimes indeed not hid very deep, not\r\nabove one between him and the farmer, namely, his banian directly, or\r\nsome other black person to represent him. But some have so managed the\r\naffair, that, when you inquire who the farmer is,--Was such a one\r\nfarmer? No. Cantoo Baboo? No. Another? No,--at last you find three deep\r\nof fictitious farmers, and you find the European gentlemen, high in\r\nplace and authority, the real farmers of the settlement. So that the\r\nzemindars were dispossessed, the country racked and ruined, for the\r\nbenefit of an European, under the name of a farmer: for you will easily\r\njudge whether these gentlemen had fallen so deeply in love with the\r\nbanians, and thought so highly of their merits and services, as to\r\nreward _them_ with all the possessions of the great landed interest of\r\nthe country. Your Lordships are too grave, wise, and discerning, to make\r\nit necessary for me to say more upon that subject. Tell me that the\r\nbanians of English gentlemen, dependants on them at Calcutta, were the\r\nfarmers throughout, and I believe I need not tell your Lordships for\r\nwhose benefit they were farmers.\r\n\r\nBut there is one of these who comes so nearly, indeed so precisely,\r\nwithin this observation, that it is impossible for me to pass him by.\r\nWhoever has heard of Mr. Hastings's name, with any knowledge of Indian\r\nconnections, has heard of his banian, Cantoo Baboo. This man is well\r\nknown in the records of the Company, as his agent for receiving secret\r\ngifts, confiscations, and presents. You would have imagined that he\r\nwould at least have kept _him_ out of these farms, in order to give the\r\nmeasure a color at least of disinterestedness, and to show that this\r\nwhole system of corruption and pecuniary oppression was carried on for\r\nthe benefit of the Company. The Governor-General and Council made an\r\nostensible order by which no collector, or person concerned in the\r\nrevenue, should have any connection with these farms. This order did not\r\ninclude the Governor-General in the words of it, but more than included\r\nhim in the spirit of it; because his power to protect a farmer-general\r\nin the person of his own servant was infinitely greater than that of any\r\nsubordinate person. Mr. Hastings, in breach of this order, gave farms to\r\nhis own banian. You find him the farmer of great, of vast and extensive\r\nfarms. Another regulation that was made on that occasion was, that no\r\nfarmer should have, except in particular cases, which were marked,\r\ndescribed, and accurately distinguished, a greater farm than what paid\r\n10,000_l._ a year to government. Mr. Hastings, who had broken the first\r\nregulation by giving any farm at all to his banian, finding himself\r\nbolder, broke the second too, and, instead of 10,000_l._, gave him farms\r\npaying a revenue of 130,000_l._ a year to government. Men undoubtedly\r\nhave been known to be under the dominion of their domestics; such\r\nthings have happened to great men: they never have happened justifiably\r\nin my opinion. They have never happened excusably; but we are acquainted\r\nsufficiently with the weakness of human nature to know that a domestic\r\nwho has served you in a near office long, and in your opinion\r\nfaithfully, does become a kind of relation; it brings on a great\r\naffection and regard for his interest. Now was this the case with Mr.\r\nHastings and Cantoo Baboo? Mr. Hastings was just arrived at his\r\ngovernment, and Cantoo Baboo had been but a year in his service; so that\r\nhe could not in that time have contracted any great degree of friendship\r\nfor him. These people do not live in your house; the Hindoo servants\r\nnever sleep in it; they cannot eat with your servants; they have no\r\nsecond table, in which they can be continually about you, to be\r\ndomesticated with yourself, a part of your being, as people's servants\r\nare to a certain degree. These persons live all abroad; they come at\r\nstated hours upon matters of business, and nothing more. But if it had\r\nbeen otherwise, Mr. Hastings's connection with Cantoo Baboo had been but\r\nof a year's standing; he had before served in that capacity Mr. Sykes,\r\nwho recommended him to Mr. Hastings. Your Lordships, then, are to judge\r\nwhether such outrageous violations of all the principles by which Mr.\r\nHastings pretended to be guided in the settlement of these farms were\r\nfor the benefit of this old, decayed, affectionate servant of one year's\r\nstanding: your Lordships will judge of that.\r\n\r\nI have here spoken only of the beginning of a great, notorious system of\r\ncorruption, which branched out so many ways and into such a variety of\r\nabuses, and has afflicted that kingdom with such horrible evils from\r\nthat day to this, that I will venture to say it will make one of the\r\ngreatest, weightiest, and most material parts of the charge that is now\r\nbefore you; as I believe I need not tell your Lordships that an attempt\r\nto set up the whole landed interest of a kingdom to auction must be\r\nattended, not only in that act, but every consequential act, with most\r\ngrievous and terrible consequences.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I will now come to a scene of peculation of another kind:\r\nnamely, a peculation by the direct sale of offices of justice,--by the\r\ndirect sale of the successions of families,--by the sale of\r\nguardianships and trusts, held most sacred among the people of India: by\r\nthe sale of them, not, as before, to farmers, not, as you might imagine,\r\nto near relations of the families, but a sale of them to the unfaithful\r\nservants of those families, their own perfidious servants, who had\r\nruined their estates, who, if any balances had accrued to the\r\ngovernment, had been the cause of those debts. Those very servants were\r\nput in power over their estates, their persons, and their families, by\r\nMr. Hastings, for a shameful price. It will be proved to your Lordships,\r\nin the course of this business, that Mr. Hastings has done this in\r\nanother sacred trust, the most sacred trust a man can have,--that is, in\r\nthe case of those _vakeels_, (as they call them,) agents, or attorneys,\r\nwho had been sent to assert and support the rights of their miserable\r\nmasters before the Council-General. It will be proved that these vakeels\r\nwere by Mr. Hastings, for a price to be paid for it, put in possession\r\nof the very power, situation, and estates of those masters who sent them\r\nto Calcutta to defend them from wrong and violence. The selling offices\r\nof justice, the sale of succession in families, of guardianships and\r\nother sacred trusts, the selling masters to their servants, and\r\nprincipals to the attorneys they employed to defend themselves, were all\r\nparts of the same system; and these were the horrid ways in which he\r\nreceived bribes beyond any common rate.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hastings was appointed in the year 1773 to be Governor-General\r\nof Bengal, together with Mr. Barwell, General Clavering, Colonel Monson,\r\nand Mr. Francis, the Company, knowing the former corrupt state of their\r\nservice, (but the whole corrupt system of Mr. Hastings at that time not\r\nbeing known or even suspected at home,) did order them, in discharge of\r\nthe spirit of the act of Parliament, to make an inquiry into all manner\r\nof corruptions and malversations in office, without the exception of any\r\npersons whatever. Your Lordships are to know that the act did expressly\r\nauthorize the Court of Directors to frame a body of instructions, and to\r\ngive orders to their new servants appointed under the act of Parliament,\r\nlest it should be supposed that they, by their appointment under the\r\nact, could supersede the authority of the Directors. The Directors,\r\nsensible of the power left in them over their servants by the act of\r\nParliament, though their nomination was taken from them, did, agreeably\r\nto the spirit and power of that act, give this order.\r\n\r\nThe Council consisted of two parties: Mr. Hastings and Mr. Barwell, who\r\nwere chosen and kept there upon the idea of their local knowledge; and\r\nthe other three, who were appointed on account of their great parts and\r\nknown integrity. And I will venture to say that those three gentlemen\r\ndid so execute their duty in India, in all the substantial parts of it,\r\nthat they will serve as a shield to cover the honor of England, whenever\r\nthis country is upbraided in India.\r\n\r\nThey found a rumor running through the country of great peculations and\r\noppressions. Soon after, when it was known what their instructions were,\r\nand that the Council was ready, as is the first duty of all governors,\r\neven when there is no express order, to receive complaints against the\r\noppressions and corruptions of government in any part of it, they found\r\nsuch a body (and that body shall be produced to your Lordships) of\r\ncorruption and peculation in every walk, in every department, in every\r\nsituation of life, in the sale of the most sacred trusts, and in the\r\ndestruction of the most ancient families of the country, as I believe in\r\nso short a time never was unveiled since the world began.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships would imagine that Mr. Hastings would at least ostensibly\r\nhave taken some part in endeavoring to bring these corruptions before\r\nthe public, or that he would at least have acted with some little\r\nmanagement in his opposition. But, alas! it was not in his power; there\r\nwas not one, I think, but I am sure very few, of these general articles\r\nof corruption, in which the most eminent figure in the crowd, the\r\nprincipal figure as it were in the piece, was not Mr. Hastings himself.\r\nThere were a great many others involved; for all departments were\r\ncorrupted and vitiated. But you could not open a page in which you did\r\nnot see Mr. Hastings, or in which you did not see Cantoo Baboo. Either\r\nthe black or white side of Mr. Hastings constantly was visible to the\r\nworld in every part of these transactions.\r\n\r\nWith the other gentlemen, who were visible too, I have at present no\r\ndealing. Mr. Hastings, instead of using any management on that occasion,\r\ninstantly set up his power and authority, directly against the majority\r\nof the Council, directly against his colleagues, directly against the\r\nauthority of the East India Company and the authority of the act of\r\nParliament, to put a dead stop to all these inquiries. He broke up the\r\nCouncil, the moment they attempted to perform this part of their duty.\r\nAs the evidence multiplied upon him, the daring exertions of his power\r\nin stopping all inquiries increased continually. But he gave a credit\r\nand authority to the evidence by these attempts to suppress it.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have heard that among the body of the accusers of this\r\ncorruption there was a principal man in the country, a man of the first\r\nrank and authority in it, called Nundcomar, who had the management of\r\nrevenues amounting to 150,000_l._ a year, and who had, if really\r\ninclined to play the small game with which he has been charged by his\r\naccusers, abundant means to gratify himself in playing great ones; but\r\nMr. Hastings has himself given him, upon the records of the Company, a\r\ncharacter which would at least justify the Council in making some\r\ninquiry into charges made by him.\r\n\r\nFirst, he was perfectly competent to make them, because he was in the\r\nmanagement of those affairs from which Mr. Hastings is supposed to have\r\nreceived corrupt emolument. He and his son were the chief managers in\r\nthose transactions. He was therefore perfectly competent to it.--Mr.\r\nHastings has cleared his character; for though it is true, in the\r\ncontradictions in which Mr. Hastings has entangled himself, he has\r\nabused and insulted him, and particularly after his appearance as an\r\naccuser, yet before this he has given this testimony of him, that the\r\nhatred that had been drawn upon him, and the general obloquy of the\r\nEnglish nation, was on account of his attachment to his own prince and\r\nthe liberties of his country. Be he what he might, I am not disposed,\r\nnor have I the least occasion, to defend either his conduct or his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nIt is to no purpose for Mr. Hastings to spend time in idle objections to\r\nthe character of Nundcomar. Let him be as bad as Mr. Hastings represents\r\nhim. I suppose he was a caballing, bribing, intriguing politician, like\r\nothers in that country, both black and white. We know associates in dark\r\nand evil actions are not generally the best of men; but be that as it\r\nwill, it generally happens that they are the best of all discoverers. If\r\nMr. Hastings were the accuser of Nundcomar, I should think the\r\npresumptions equally strong against Nundcomar, if he had acted as Mr.\r\nHastings has acted.--He was not only competent, but the most competent\r\nof all men to be Mr. Hastings's accuser. But Mr. Hastings has himself\r\nestablished both his character and his competency by employing him\r\nagainst Mahomed Reza Khân. He shall not blow hot and cold. In what\r\nrespect was Mr. Hastings better than Mahomed Reza Khân, that the whole\r\nrule, principle, and system of accusation and inquiry should be totally\r\nreversed in general, nay, reversed in the particular instance, the\r\nmoment he became accuser against Mr. Hastings?--Such was the accuser. He\r\nwas the man that gave the bribes, and, in addition to his own evidence,\r\noffers proof by other witnesses.\r\n\r\nWhat was the accusation? Was the accusation improbable, either on\r\naccount of the subject-matter or the actor in it? Does such an\r\nappointment as that of Munny Begum, in the most barefaced evasion of his\r\norders, appear to your Lordships a matter that contains no just\r\npresumptions of guilt, so that, when a charge of bribery comes upon it,\r\nyou are prepared to reject it, as if the action were so clear and proper\r\nthat no man could attribute it to an improper motive? And as to the\r\nman,--is Mr. Hastings a man against whom a charge of bribery is\r\nimprobable? Why, he owns it. He is a professor of it. He reduces it into\r\nscheme and system. He glories in it. He turns it to merit, and declares\r\nit is the best way of supplying the exigencies of the Company. Why,\r\ntherefore, should it be held improbable?--But I cannot mention this\r\nproceeding without shame and horror.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, when this man appeared as an accuser of Mr. Hastings, if he\r\nwas a man of bad character, it was a great advantage to Mr. Hastings to\r\nbe accused by a man of that description. There was no likelihood of any\r\ngreat credit being given to him.\r\n\r\nThis person, who, in one of those sales of which I have already given\r\nyou some account in the history of the last period of the revolutions of\r\nBengal, had been, or thought he had been, cheated of his money, had made\r\nsome discoveries, and been guilty of that great irremissible sin in\r\nIndia, the disclosure of peculation. He afterwards came with a second\r\ndisclosure, and was likely to have odium enough upon the occasion. He\r\ndirectly charged Mr. Hastings with the receipt of bribes, amounting\r\ntogether to about 40,000_l._ sterling, given by himself, on his own\r\naccount and that of Munny Begum. The charge was accompanied with every\r\nparticular which could facilitate proof or detection,--time, place,\r\npersons, species, to whom paid, by whom received. Here was a fair\r\nopportunity for Mr. Hastings at once to defeat the malice of his enemies\r\nand to clear his character to the world. His course was different. He\r\nrailed much at the accuser, but did not attempt to refute the\r\naccusation. He refuses to permit the inquiry to go on, attempts to\r\ndissolve the Council, commands his banian not to attend. The Council,\r\nhowever, goes on, examines to the bottom, and resolves that the charge\r\nwas proved, and that the money ought to go to the Company. Mr. Hastings\r\nthen broke up the Council,--I will not say whether legally or illegally.\r\nThe Company's law counsel thought he might legally do it; but he\r\ncorruptly did it, and left mankind no room to judge but that it was done\r\nfor the screening of his own guilt: for a man may use a legal power\r\ncorruptly, and for the most shameful and detestable purposes. And thus\r\nmatters continued, till he commenced a criminal prosecution against this\r\nman,--this man whom he dared not meet as a defendant.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, instead of answering the charge, attacks the accuser.\r\nInstead of meeting the man in front, he endeavored to go round, to come\r\nupon his flanks and rear, but never to meet him in the face, upon the\r\nground of his accusation, as he was bound by the express authority of\r\nlaw and the express injunctions of the Directors to do. If the bribery\r\nis not admitted on the evidence of Nundcomar, yet his suppressing it is\r\na crime, a violation of the orders of the Court of Directors. He\r\ndisobeyed those instructions; and if it be only for disobedience, for\r\nrebellion against his masters, (putting the corrupt motive out of the\r\nquestion,) I charge him for this disobedience, and especially on account\r\nof the principles upon which he proceeded in it.\r\n\r\nThen he took another step: he accused Nundcomar of a conspiracy,--which\r\nwas a way he then and ever since has used, whenever means were taken to\r\ndetect any of his own iniquities.\r\n\r\nAnd here it becomes necessary to mention another circumstance of\r\nhistory: that the legislature, not trusting entirely to the\r\nGovernor-General and Council, had sent out a court of justice to be a\r\ncounter security against these corruptions, and to detect and punish any\r\nsuch misdemeanors as might appear. And this court I take for granted has\r\ndone great services.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings flew to this court, which was meant to protect in their\r\nsituations informers against bribery and corruption, rather than to\r\nprotect the accused from any of the preliminary methods which must\r\nindispensably be used for the purpose of detecting their guilt,--he flew\r\nto this court, charging this Nundcomar and others with being\r\nconspirators.\r\n\r\nA man might be convicted as a conspirator, and yet afterwards live; he\r\nmight put the matter into other hands, and go on with his information;\r\nnothing less than _stone-dead_ would do the business. And here happened\r\nan odd concurrence of circumstances. Long before Nundcomar preferred his\r\ncharge, he knew that Mr. Hastings was plotting his ruin, and that for\r\nthis purpose he had used a man whom he, Nundcomar, had turned out of\r\ndoors, called Mohun Persaud. Mr. Hastings had seen papers put upon the\r\nboard, charging him with this previous plot for the destruction of\r\nNundcomar; and this identical person, Mohun Persaud, whom Nundcomar had\r\ncharged as Mr. Hastings's associate in plotting his ruin, was now again\r\nbrought forward as the principal evidence against him. I will not enter\r\n(God forbid I should!) into the particulars of the subsequent trial of\r\nNundcomar; but you will find the marks and characters of it to be these.\r\nYou will find a close connection between Mr. Hastings and the\r\nchief-justice, which we shall prove. We shall prove that one of the\r\nwitnesses who appeared there was a person who had been before, or has\r\nsince been, concerned with Mr. Hastings in his most iniquitous\r\ntransactions. You will find, what is very odd, that in this trial for\r\nforgery with which this man stood charged, forgery in a private\r\ntransaction, all the persons who were witnesses or parties to it had\r\nbeen, before or since, the particular friends of Mr. Hastings,--in\r\nshort, persons from that rabble with whom Mr. Hastings was concerned,\r\nboth before and since, in various transactions and negotiations of the\r\nmost criminal kind. But the law took its course. I have nothing more to\r\nsay than that the man is gone,--hanged justly, if you please; and that\r\nit did so happen,--luckily for Mr. Hastings,--it so happened, that the\r\nrelief of Mr. Hastings, and the justice of the court, and the resolution\r\nnever to relax its rigor, did all concur just at a happy nick of time\r\nand moment; and Mr. Hastings, accordingly, had the full benefit of them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHis accuser was supposed to be what men may be, and yet very competent\r\nfor accusers, namely, one of his accomplices in guilty actions,--one of\r\nthose persons who may have a great deal to say of bribes. All that I\r\ncontend for is, that he was in the closest intimacy with Mr. Hastings,\r\nwas in a situation for giving bribes,--and that Mr. Hastings was proved\r\nafterwards to have received a sum of money from him, which may be well\r\nreferred to bribes.\r\n\r\nThis example had its use in the way in which it was intended to operate,\r\nand in which alone it could operate. It did not discourage forgeries:\r\nthey went on at their usual rate, neither more nor less: but it put an\r\nend to all accusations against all persons in power for any corrupt\r\npractice. Mr. Hastings observes, that no man in India complains of him.\r\nIt is generally true. The voice of all India is stopped. All complaint\r\nwas strangled with the same cord that strangled Nundcomar. This murdered\r\nnot only that accuser, but all future accusation; and not only defeated,\r\nbut totally vitiated and reversed all the ends for which this country,\r\nto its eternal and indelible dishonor, had sent out a pompous embassy of\r\njustice to the remotest parts of the globe.\r\n\r\nBut though Nundcomar was put out of the way by the means by which _he_\r\nwas removed, a part of the charge was not strangled with him. Whilst the\r\nprocess against Nundcomar was carrying on before Sir Elijah Impey, the\r\nprocess was continuing against Mr. Hastings in other modes; the receipt\r\nof a part of those bribes from Munny Begum, to the amount of 15,000_l._,\r\nwas proved against him, and that a sum to the same amount was to be paid\r\nto his associate, Mr. Middleton. As it was proved at Calcutta, so it\r\nwill be proved at your Lordships' bar to your entire satisfaction by\r\nrecords and living testimony now in England. It was, indeed, obliquely\r\nadmitted by Mr. Hastings himself.\r\n\r\nThe excuse for this bribe, fabricated by Mr. Hastings, and taught to\r\nMunny Begum, when he found that she was obliged to prove it against him,\r\nwas, that it was given to him for his entertainment, according to some\r\npretended custom, at the rate of 200_l._ sterling a day, whilst he\r\nremained at Moorshedabad. My Lords, this leads me to a few reflections\r\non the apology or defence of this bribe. We shall certainly, I hope,\r\nrender it clear to your Lordships that it was not paid in this manner as\r\na daily allowance, but given in a gross sum. But take it in his own way,\r\nit was no less illegal, and no less contrary to his covenant; but if\r\ntrue under the circumstances, it was an horrible aggravation of his\r\ncrime. The first thing that strikes is, that visits from Mr. Hastings\r\nare pretty severe things, and hospitality at Moorshedabad is an\r\nexpensive virtue, though for provision it is one of the cheapest\r\ncountries in the universe. No wonder that Mr. Hastings lengthened his\r\nvisit, and made it extend near three months. Such hosts and such guests\r\ncannot be soon parted. Two hundred pounds a day for a visit! It is at\r\nthe rate of 78,000_l._ a year for himself; and as I find his companion\r\nwas put on the same allowance, it will be 146,000_l._ a year for\r\nhospitality to two English gentlemen. I believe that there is not a\r\nprince in Europe who goes to such expensive hospitality of splendor.\r\n\r\nBut that you may judge of the true nature of this hospitality of\r\ncorruption, I must bring before you the business of the visitor and the\r\ncondition of the host, as stated by Mr. Hastings himself, who best knows\r\nwhat he was doing. He was, then, at the old capital of Bengal at the\r\ntime of this expensive entertainment, on a business of retrenchment, and\r\nfor the establishment of a most harsh, rigorous, and oppressive economy.\r\nHe wishes the task were assigned to spirits of a less gentle kind. By\r\nMr. Hastings's account, he was giving daily and hourly wounds to his\r\nhumanity in depriving of their sustenance hundreds of persons of the\r\nancient nobility of a great fallen kingdom. Yet it was in the midst of\r\nthis galling duty, it was at that very moment of his tender sensibility,\r\nthat, from the collected morsels plucked from the famished mouths of\r\nhundreds of decayed, indigent, and starving nobility, he gorged his\r\nravenous maw with 200_l._ a day for his entertainment. In the course of\r\nall this proceeding your Lordships will not fail to observe he is never\r\ncorrupt, but he is cruel; he never dines with comfort, but where he is\r\nsure to create a famine. He never robs from the loose superfluity of\r\nstanding greatness; he devours the fallen, the indigent, the\r\nnecessitous. His extortion is not like the generous rapacity of the\r\nprincely eagle, who snatches away the living, struggling prey; he is a\r\nvulture, who feeds upon the prostrate, the dying, and the dead. As his\r\ncruelty is more shocking than his corruption, so his hypocrisy has\r\nsomething more frightful than his cruelty; for whilst his bloody and\r\nrapacious hand signs proscriptions, and now sweeps away the food of the\r\nwidow and the orphan, his eyes overflow with tears, and he converts the\r\nhealing balm that bleeds from wounded humanity into a rancorous and\r\ndeadly poison to the race of man.\r\n\r\nWell, there was an end to this tragic entertainment, this feast of\r\nTantalus. The few left on the pension-list, the poor remnants that had\r\nescaped, were they paid by his administratrix and deputy, Munny Begum?\r\nNot a shilling. No fewer than forty-nine petitions, mostly from the\r\nwidows of the greatest and most splendid houses of Bengal, came before\r\nthe Council, praying in the most deplorable manner for some sort of\r\nrelief out of the pittance assigned them. His colleagues, General\r\nClavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr. Francis, men who, when England is\r\nreproached for the government of India, will, I repeat it, as a shield\r\nbe held up between this nation and infamy, did, in conformity to the\r\nstrict orders of the Directors, appoint Mahomed Reza Khân to his old\r\noffices, that is, to the general superintendency of the household and\r\nthe administration of justice, a person who by his authority might keep\r\nsome order in the ruling family and in the state. The Court of Directors\r\nauthorized them to assure those offices to him, with a salary reduced\r\nindeed to 30,000_l._ a year, during his good behavior. But Mr. Hastings,\r\nas soon as he obtained a majority by the death of the two best men ever\r\nsent to India, notwithstanding the orders of the Court of Directors, in\r\nspite of the public faith solemnly pledged to Mahomed Reza Khân, without\r\na shadow of complaint, had the audacity to dispossess him of all his\r\noffices, and appoint his bribing patroness, the old dancing-girl, Munny\r\nBegum, once more to the viceroyalty and all its attendant honors and\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nThe pretence was more insolent and shameless than the act. Modesty does\r\nnot long survive innocence. He brings forward the miserable pageant of\r\nthe Nabob, as he called him, to be the instrument of his own disgrace,\r\nand the scandal of his family and government. He makes him to pass by\r\nhis mother, and to petition us to appoint Munny Begum once more to the\r\nadministration of the viceroyalty. He distributed Mahomed Reza Khân's\r\nsalary as a spoil.\r\n\r\nWhen the orders of the Court to restore Mahomed Reza Khân, with their\r\nopinion on the corrupt cause of his removal, and a second time to pledge\r\nto him the public faith for his continuance, were received, Mr.\r\nHastings, who had been just before a pattern of obedience, when the\r\ndespoiling, oppressing, imprisoning, and persecuting this man was the\r\nobject, yet, when the order was of a beneficial nature, and pleasant to\r\na well-formed mind, he at once loses all his old principles, he grows\r\nstubborn and refractory, and refuses obedience. And in this sullen,\r\nuncomplying mood he continues, until, to gratify Mr. Francis, in an\r\nagreement on some of their differences, he consented to his proposition\r\nof obedience to the appointment of the Court of Directors. He grants to\r\nhis arrangement of convenience what he had refused to his duty, and\r\nreplaces that magistrate. But mark the double character of the man,\r\nnever true to anything but fraud and duplicity. At the same time that he\r\npublicly replaces this magistrate, pretending compliance with his\r\ncolleague and obedience to his masters, he did, in defiance of his own\r\nand the public faith, privately send an assurance to the Nabob, that is,\r\nto Munny Begum,--informs her that he was compelled by necessity to the\r\npresent arrangement in favor of Mahomed Reza Khân, but that on the first\r\nopportunity he would certainly displace him again. And he kept faith\r\nwith his corruption; and to show how vainly any one sought protection in\r\nthe lawful authority of this kingdom, he displaced Mahomed Reza Khân\r\nfrom the lieutenancy and controllership, leaving him only the judicial\r\ndepartment miserably curtailed.\r\n\r\nBut does he adhere to his old pretence of freedom to the Nabob? No such\r\nthing. He appoints an absolute master to him under the name of Resident,\r\na creature of his personal favor, Sir John D'Oyly, from whom there is\r\nnot one syllable of correspondence and not one item of account. How\r\ngrievous this yoke was to that miserable captive appears by a paper of\r\nMr. Hastings, in which he acknowledges that the Nabob had offered, out\r\nof the 160,000_l._ payable to him yearly, to give up to the Company no\r\nless than 40,000_l._ a year, in order to have the free disposal of the\r\nrest. On this all comment is superfluous. Your Lordships are furnished\r\nwith a standard by which you may estimate his real receipt from the\r\nrevenue assigned to him, the nature of the pretended Residency, and its\r\npredatory effects. It will give full credit to what was generally\r\nrumored and believed, that substantially and beneficially the Nabob\r\nnever received fifty out of the one hundred and sixty thousand pounds;\r\nwhich will account for his known poverty and wretchedness, and that of\r\nall about him.\r\n\r\nThus by his corrupt traffic of bribes with one scandalous woman he\r\ndisgraced and enfeebled the native Mahomedan government, captived the\r\nperson of the sovereign, and ruined and subverted the justice of the\r\ncountry. What is worse, the steps taken for the murder of Nundcomar, his\r\naccuser, have confirmed and given sanction not only to the corruptions\r\nthen practised by the Governor-General, but to all of which he has since\r\nbeen guilty. This will furnish your Lordships with some general idea\r\nwhich will enable you to judge of the bribe for which he sold the\r\ncountry government.\r\n\r\nUnder this head you will have produced to you full proof of his sale of\r\na judicial office to a person called Khân Jehan Khân, and the modes he\r\ntook to frustrate all inquiry on that subject, upon a wicked and false\r\npretence, that, according to his religious scruples, he could not be\r\nsworn.\r\n\r\nThe great end and object I have in view is to show the criminal\r\ntendency, the mischievous nature of these crimes, and the means taken to\r\nelude their discovery. I am now giving your Lordships that general view\r\nwhich may serve to characterize Mr. Hastings's administration in all the\r\nother parts of it.\r\n\r\nIt was not true in fact, as Mr. Hastings gives out, that there was\r\nnothing now against him, and that, when he had got rid of Nundcomar and\r\nhis charge, he got rid of the whole. No such thing. An immense load of\r\ncharges of bribery remained. They were coming afterwards from every part\r\nof the province; and there was no office in the execution of justice\r\nwhich he was not accused of having sold in the most flagitious manner.\r\n\r\nAfter all this thundering the sky grew calm and clear, and Mr. Hastings\r\nsat with recorded peculation, with peculation proved upon oath on the\r\nminutes of that very Council,--he sat at the head of that Council and\r\nthat board where his peculations were proved against him. These were\r\nafterwards transmitted and recorded in the registers of his masters, as\r\nan eternal monument of his corruption, and of his high disobedience, and\r\nflagitious attempts to prevent a discovery of the various peculations of\r\nwhich he had been guilty, to the disgrace and ruin of the country\r\ncommitted to his care.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, after the execution of Nundcomar, if he had intended to\r\nmake even a decent and commonly sensible use of it, would naturally have\r\nsaid, \"This man is justly taken away who has accused me of these crimes;\r\nbut as there are other witnesses, as there are other means of a further\r\ninquiry, as the man is gone of whose perjuries I might have reason to be\r\nafraid, let us now go into the inquiry.\" I think he did very ill not to\r\ngo into the inquiry when the man was alive; but be it so, that he was\r\nafraid of him, and waited till he was removed, why not afterwards go\r\ninto such an inquiry? Why not go into an inquiry of all the other\r\npeculations and charges upon him, which were innumerable, one of which I\r\nhave just mentioned in particular, the charge of Munny Begum, of having\r\nreceived from her, or her adopted son, a bribe of 40,000_l._?\r\n\r\nIs it fit for a governor to say, will Mr. Hastings say before this\r\naugust assembly, \"I may be accused in a court of justice,--I am upon my\r\ndefence,--let all charges remain against me,--I will not give you an\r\naccount\"? Is it fit that a governor should sit with recorded bribery\r\nupon him at the head of a public board and the government of a great\r\nkingdom, when it is in his power by inquiry to do it away? No: the\r\nchastity of character of a man in that situation ought to be as dear to\r\nhim as his innocence. Nay, more depended upon it. His innocence regarded\r\nhimself; his character regarded the public justice, regarded his\r\nauthority, and the respect due to the English in that country. I charge\r\nit upon him, that not only did he suppress the inquiry to the best of\r\nhis power, (and it shall be proved,) but he did not in any one instance\r\nendeavor to clear off that imputation and reproach from the English\r\ngovernment. He went further; he never denied hardly any of those charges\r\nat the time. They are so numerous that I cannot be positive; some of\r\nthem he might meet with some sort of denial, but the most part he did\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe first thing a man under such an accusation owes to the world is to\r\ndeny the charge; next, to put it to the proof; and lastly, to let\r\ninquiry freely go on. He did not permit this, but stopped it all in his\r\npower. I am to mention some exceptions, perhaps, hereafter, which will\r\ntend to fortify the principle tenfold.\r\n\r\nHe promised, indeed, the Court of Directors (to whom he never denied the\r\nfacts) a full and liberal explanation of these transactions; which full\r\nand liberal explanation he never gave. Many years passed; even\r\nParliament took notice of it; and he never gave them a liberal\r\nexplanation, or any explanation at all of them. A man may say, \"I am\r\nthreatened with a suit in a court, and it may be very disadvantageous to\r\nme, if I disclose my defence.\" That is a proper answer for a man in\r\ncommon life, who has no particular character to sustain; but is that a\r\nproper answer for a governor accused of bribery, that accusation\r\ntransmitted to his masters, and his masters giving credit to it? Good\r\nGod! is that a state in which a man is to say, \"I am upon the\r\ndefensive--I am on my guard,--I will give you no satisfaction,--I have\r\npromised it, but I have already deferred it for seven or eight years\"?\r\nIs not this tantamount to a denial?\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, with this great body of bribery against him, was\r\nprovidentially freed from Nundcomar, one of his accusers, and, as good\r\nevents do not come alone, (I think there is some such proverb,) it did\r\nso happen that all the rest, or a great many of them, ran away. But,\r\nhowever, the recorded evidence of the former charges continued; no new\r\nevidence came in; and Mr. Hastings enjoyed that happy repose which\r\nbranded peculation, fixed and eternized upon the records of the Company,\r\nmust leave upon a mind conscious of its own integrity.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I will venture to say, there is no man but owes something to\r\nhis character. It is the grace, undoubtedly, of a virtuous, firm mind\r\noften to despise common, vulgar calumny; but if ever there is an\r\noccasion in which it does become such a mind to disprove it, it is the\r\ncase of being charged in high office with pecuniary malversation,\r\npecuniary corruption. There is no case in which it becomes an honest\r\nman, much less a great man, to leave upon record specific charges\r\nagainst him of corruption in his government, without taking any one step\r\nwhatever to refute them.\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Hastings took no step to refute the charges, he took many\r\nsteps to punish the authors of them; and those miserable people who had\r\nthe folly to make complaints against Mr. Hastings, to make them under\r\nthe authority of an act of Parliament, under every sanction of public\r\nfaith, yet, in consequence of those charges, every person concerned in\r\nthem has been, as your Lordships will see, since his restoration to\r\npower, absolutely undone, brought from the highest situation to the\r\nlowest misery, so that they may have good reason to repent they ever\r\ntrusted an English Council, that they ever trusted a Court of Directors,\r\nthat they ever trusted an English act of Parliament, that they ever\r\ndared to make their complaints.\r\n\r\nAnd here I charge upon Mr. Hastings, that, by never taking a single step\r\nto defeat or detect the falsehood of any of those charges against him,\r\nand by punishing the authors of them, he has been guilty of such a\r\nsubversion of all the principles of British government as will deserve,\r\nand will I dare say meet, your Lordships' most severe animadversion.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this inquiry we find a sort of pause in his\r\npeculations, a sort of gap in the history, as if pages were torn out.\r\nNo longer we meet with the same activity in taking money that was before\r\nfound; not even a trace of complimentary presents is to be found in the\r\nrecords during the time whilst General Clavering, Colonel Monson, and\r\nMr. Francis formed the majority of the Council. There seems to have been\r\na kind of truce with that sort of conduct for a while, and Mr. Hastings\r\nrested upon his arms. However, the very moment Mr. Hastings returned to\r\npower, peculation began again just at the same instant; the moment we\r\nfind him free from the compulsion and terror of a majority of persons\r\notherwise disposed than himself, we find him at his peculation again.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, at this time very serious inquiries had begun in the House of\r\nCommons concerning peculation. They did not go directly to Bengal, but\r\nthey began upon the coast of Coromandel, and with the principal\r\ngovernors there. There was, however, an universal opinion (and justly\r\nfounded) that these inquiries would go to far greater lengths. Mr.\r\nHastings was resolved, then, to change the whole course and order of his\r\nproceeding. Nothing could persuade him, upon any account, to lay aside\r\nhis system of bribery: that he was resolved to persevere in. The point\r\nwas now to reconcile it with his safety. The first thing he did was to\r\nattempt to conceal it; and accordingly we find him depositing very great\r\nsums of money in the public treasury through the means of the two\r\npersons I have already mentioned, namely, the deputy-treasurer and the\r\naccountant,--paying them in and taking bonds for them as money of his\r\nown, and bearing legal interest. This was his method of endeavoring to\r\nconceal some at least of his bribes: for I would not suggest, nor have\r\nyour Lordships to think, that I believe that these were his only\r\nbribes,--for there is reason to think there was an infinite number\r\nbesides; but it did so happen that they were those bribes which he\r\nthought might be discovered, some of which he knew were discovered, and\r\nall of which he knew might become the subject of a Parliamentary\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings said he might have concealed them forever. Every one knows\r\nthe facility of concealing corrupt transactions everywhere, in India\r\nparticularly. But this is by himself proved not to be universally true,\r\nat least not to be true in his own opinion; for he tells you, in his\r\nletter from Cheltenham, that he _would_ have concealed the Nabob's\r\n100,000_l._, but that the magnitude rendered it easy of discovery. He,\r\ntherefore, avows an intention of concealment.\r\n\r\nBut it happens here, very singularly, that this sum, which his fears of\r\ndiscovery by _others_ obliged him to discover _himself_, happens to be\r\none of those of which no trace whatsoever appears, except merely from\r\nthe operation of his own apprehensions. There is no collateral\r\ntestimony: Middleton knew nothing of it; Anderson knew nothing of it; it\r\nwas not directly communicated to the faithful Larkins or the trusty\r\nCroftes;--which proves, indeed, the facility of concealment. The fact\r\nis, you find the application always upon the discovery. But concealment\r\nor discovery is a thing of accident.\r\n\r\nThe bribes which I have hitherto brought before your Lordships belong to\r\nthe first period of his bribery, before he thought of the doctrine on\r\nwhich he has since defended it. There are many other bribes which we\r\ncharge him with having received during this first period, before an\r\nimproving conversation and close virtuous connection with great lawyers\r\nhad taught him how to practise bribes in such a manner as to defy\r\ndetection, and instead of punishment to plead merit. I am not bound to\r\nfind order and consistency in guilt: it is the reign of disorder. The\r\norder of the proceeding, as far as I am able to trace such a scene of\r\nprevarication, direct fraud, falsehood, and falsification of the public\r\naccounts, was this. From bribes he knew he could never abstain; and his\r\nthen precarious situation made him the more rapacious. He knew that a\r\nfew of his former bribes had been discovered, declared, recorded,--that\r\nfor the moment, indeed, he was secure, because all informers had been\r\npunished and all concealers rewarded. He expected hourly a total change\r\nin the Council, and that men like Clavering and Monson might be again\r\njoined to Francis, that some great avenger should arise from their\r\nashes,--\"_Exoriare, aliquis nostris ex ossibus ultor_,\"--and that a more\r\nsevere investigation and an infinitely more full display would be made\r\nof his robbery than hitherto had been done. He therefore began, in the\r\nagony of his guilt, to cast about for some device by which he might\r\ncontinue his offence, if possible, with impunity,--and possibly make a\r\nmerit of it. He therefore first carefully perused the act of Parliament\r\nforbidding bribery, and his old covenant engaging him not to receive\r\npresents. And here he was more successful than upon former occasions. If\r\never an act was studiously and carefully framed to prevent bribery, it\r\nis that law of the 13th of the King, which he well observes admits no\r\nlatitudes of construction, no subterfuge, no escape, no evasion. Yet has\r\nhe found a defence of his crimes even in the very provisions which were\r\nmade for their prevention and their punishment. Besides the penalty\r\nwhich belongs to every informer, the East India Company was invested\r\nwith a fiction of property in all such bribes, in order to drag them\r\nwith more facility out of the corrupt hands which held them. The\r\ncovenant, with an exception of one hundred pounds, and the act of\r\nParliament, without any exception, declared that the Governor-General\r\nand Council should receive no presents _for their own use_. He therefore\r\nconcluded that the system of bribery and extortion might be\r\nclandestinely and safely carried on, provided the party taking the\r\nbribes had an inward intention and mental reservation that they should\r\nbe privately applied to the Company's service in any way the briber\r\nshould think fit, and that on many occasions this would prove the best\r\nmethod of supply for the exigencies of their service.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly formed, or pretended to form, a private bribe exchequer,\r\ncollateral with and independent of the Company's public exchequer,\r\nthough in some cases administered by those whom for his purposes he had\r\nplaced in the regular official department. It is no wonder that he has\r\ntaken to himself an extraordinary degree of merit. For surely such an\r\ninvention of finance, I believe, never was heard of,--an exchequer\r\nwherein extortion was the assessor, fraud the cashier, confusion the\r\naccountant, concealment the reporter, and oblivion the remembrancer: in\r\nshort, such as I believe no man, but one driven by guilt into frenzy,\r\ncould ever have dreamed of.\r\n\r\nHe treats the official and regular Directors with just contempt, as a\r\nparcel of mean, mechanical book-keepers. He is an eccentric book-keeper,\r\na Pindaric accountant. I have heard of \"the poet's eye in a fine frenzy\r\nrolling.\" Here was a revenue exacted from whom he pleased, at what times\r\nhe pleased, in what proportions he pleased, through what persons he\r\npleased, by what means he pleased, to be accounted for or not, at his\r\ndiscretion, and to be applied to what service he thought proper. I do\r\nbelieve your Lordships stand astonished at this scheme; and indeed I\r\nshould be very loath to venture to state such a scheme at all, however I\r\nmight have credited it myself, to any sober ears, if, in his defence\r\nbefore the House of Commons, and before the Lords, he had not directly\r\nadmitted the fact of taking the bribes or forbidden presents, and had\r\nnot in those defences, and much more fully in his correspondence with\r\nthe Directors, admitted the fact, and justified it upon these very\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nAs this is a thing so unheard-of and unexampled in the world, I shall\r\nfirst endeavor to account as well as I can for his motives to it, which\r\nyour Lordships will receive or reject, just as you shall find them tally\r\nwith the evidence before you: I say, his motives to it; because I\r\ncontend that public valid reasons for it he could have none; and the\r\nidea of making the corruption of the Governor-General a resource to the\r\nCompany never did or could for a moment enter into his thoughts. I shall\r\nthen take notice of the juridical constructions upon which he justifies\r\nhis acting in this extraordinary manner; and lastly, show you the\r\nconcealments, prevarications, and falsehoods with which he endeavors to\r\ncover it. Because wherever you find a concealment you make a discovery.\r\nAccounts of money received and paid ought to be regular and official.\r\n\r\nHe wrote over to the Court of Directors, that there were certain sums\r\nof money he had received and which were not his own, but that he had\r\nreceived them for their use. By this time his intercourse with gentlemen\r\nof the law became more considerable than it had been before. When first\r\nattacked for presents, he never denied the receipt of them, or pretended\r\nto say they were for public purposes; but upon looking more into the\r\ncovenants, and probably with better legal advice, he found that no money\r\ncould be legally received for his own use; but as these bribes were\r\ndirectly given and received as for his own use, yet (says he) \"there was\r\nan inward destination of them in my own mind to your benefit, and to\r\nyour benefit have I applied them.\"\r\n\r\nNow here is a new system of bribery, contrary to law, very ingenious in\r\nthe contrivance, but, I believe, as unlikely to produce its intended\r\neffect upon the mind of man as any pretence that was ever used. Here Mr.\r\nHastings changes his ground. Before, he was accused as a peculator; he\r\ndid not deny the fact; he did not refund the money; he fought it off; he\r\nstood upon the defensive, and used all the means in his power to prevent\r\nthe inquiry. That was the first era of his corruption,--a bold,\r\nferocious, plain, downright use of power. In the second, he is grown a\r\nlittle more careful and guarded,--the effect of subtilty. He appears no\r\nlonger as a defendant; he holds himself up with a firm, dignified, and\r\nerect countenance, and says, \"I am not here any longer as a delinquent,\r\na receiver of bribes, to be punished for what I have done wrong, or at\r\nleast to suffer in my character for it. No: I am a great inventive\r\ngenius, who have gone out of all the ordinary roads of finance, have\r\nmade great discoveries in the unknown regions of that science, and have\r\nfor the first time established the corruption of the supreme magistrate\r\nas a principle of resource for government.\"\r\n\r\nThere are crimes, undoubtedly, of great magnitude, naturally fitted to\r\ncreate horror, and that loudly call for punishment, that have yet no\r\nidea of _turpitude_ annexed to them; but unclean hands, bribery,\r\nvenality, and peculation are offences of turpitude, such as, in a\r\ngovernor, at once debase the person and degrade the government itself,\r\nmaking it not only _horrible_, but vile and contemptible in the eyes of\r\nall mankind. In this humiliation and abjectness of guilt, he comes here\r\nnot as a criminal on his defence, but as a vast fertile genius who has\r\nmade astonishing discoveries in the art of government,--\"_Dicam insigne,\r\nrecens, alio indictum ore_\"--who, by his flaming zeal and the prolific\r\nardor and energy of his mind, has boldly dashed out of the common path,\r\nand served his country by new and untrodden ways; and now he generously\r\ncommunicates, for the benefit of all future governors and all future\r\ngovernments, the grand arcanum of his long and toilsome researches. He\r\nis the first, but, if we do not take good care, he will not be the last,\r\nthat has established the corruption of the supreme magistrate among the\r\nsettled resources of the state; and he leaves this principle as a\r\nbountiful donation, as the richest deposit that ever was made in the\r\ntreasury of Bengal. He claims glory and renown from that by which every\r\nother person since the beginning of time has been dishonored and\r\ndisgraced. It has been said of an ambassador, that he is a person\r\nemployed to tell lies for the advantage of the court that sends him. His\r\nis patriotic bribery, and public-spirited corruption. He is a peculator\r\nfor the good of his country. It has been said that private vices are\r\npublic benefits. He goes the full length of that position, and turns his\r\nprivate peculation into a public good. This is what you are to thank him\r\nfor. You are to consider him as a great inventor upon this occasion. Mr.\r\nHastings improves on this principle. He is a robber in gross, and a\r\nthief in detail,--he steals, he filches, he plunders, he oppresses, he\r\nextorts,--all for the good of the dear East India Company,--all for the\r\nadvantage of his honored masters, the Proprietors,--all in gratitude to\r\nthe dear perfidious Court of Directors, who have been in a practice to\r\nheap \"insults on his person, slanders on his character, and indignities\r\non his station,--who never had the confidence in him that they had in\r\nthe meanest of his predecessors.\"\r\n\r\nIf you sanction this practice, if, after all you have exacted from the\r\npeople by your taxes and public imposts, you are to let loose your\r\nservants upon them, to extort by bribery and peculation what they can\r\nfrom them, for the purpose of applying it to the public service only\r\nwhenever they please, this shocking consequence will follow from it. If\r\nyour Governor is discovered in taking a bribe, he will say, \"What is\r\nthat to you? mind your business; I intend it for the public service.\"\r\nThe man who dares to accuse him loses the favor of the Governor-General\r\nand the India Company. They will say, \"The Governor has been doing a\r\nmeritorious action, extorting bribes for our benefit, and you have the\r\nimpudence to think of prosecuting him.\" So that the moment the bribe is\r\ndetected, it is instantly turned into a merit: and we shall prove that\r\nthis is the case with Mr. Hastings, whenever a bribe has been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nI am now to inform your Lordships, that, when he made these great\r\ndiscoveries to the Court of Directors, he never tells them who gave him\r\nthe money, upon what occasion he received it, by what hands, or to what\r\npurposes he applied it.\r\n\r\nWhen he can himself give no account of his motives, and even declares\r\nthat he cannot assign any cause, I am authorized and required to find\r\nmotives for him,--corrupt motives for a corrupt act. There is no one\r\ncapital act of his administration that did not strongly imply\r\ncorruption. When a man is known to be free from all imputation of taking\r\nmoney, and it becomes an established part of his character, the errors\r\nor even crimes of his administration ought to be, and are in general,\r\ntraced to other sources. You know it is a maxim. But once convict a man\r\nof bribery in any instance, and once by direct evidence, and you are\r\nfurnished with a rule of irresistible presumption that every other\r\nirregular act by which unlawful gain may arise is done upon the same\r\ncorrupt motive. _Semel malus præsumitur semper malus._ As for good acts\r\ncandor, charity, justice oblige me not to assign evil motives, unless\r\nthey serve some scandalous purpose or terminate in some manifest evil\r\nend, so justice, reason, and common sense compel me to suppose that\r\nwicked acts have been done upon motives correspondent to their nature:\r\notherwise I reverse all the principles of judgment which can guide the\r\nhuman mind, and accept even the symptoms, the marks and criteria of\r\nguilt, as presumptions of innocence. One that confounds good and evil is\r\nan enemy to the good.\r\n\r\nHis conduct upon these occasions may be thought irrational. But, thank\r\nGod, guilt was never a rational thing: it distorts all the faculties of\r\nthe mind; it perverts them; it leaves a man no longer in the free use of\r\nhis reason; it puts him into confusion. He has recourse to such\r\nmiserable and absurd expedients for covering his guilt as all those who\r\nare used to sit in the seat of judgment know have been the cause of\r\ndetection of half the villanies in the world. To argue that these could\r\nnot be his reasons, because they were not wise, sound, and substantial,\r\nwould be to suppose, what is not true, that bad men were always discreet\r\nand able. But I can very well from the circumstances discover motives\r\nwhich may affect a giddy, superficial, shattered, guilty, anxious,\r\nrestless mind, full of the weak resources of fraud, craft, and intrigue,\r\nthat might induce him to make these discoveries, and to make them in the\r\nmanner he has done. Not rational, and well-fitted for their purposes, I\r\nam very ready to admit. For God forbid that guilt should ever leave a\r\nman the free, undisturbed use of his faculties! For as guilt never rose\r\nfrom a true use of our rational faculties, so it is very frequently\r\nsubversive of them. God forbid that prudence, the first of all the\r\nvirtues, as well as the supreme director of them all, should ever be\r\nemployed in the service of any of the vices! No: it takes the lead, and\r\nis never found where justice does not accompany it; and if ever it is\r\nattempted to bring it into the service of the vices, it immediately\r\nsubverts their cause. It tends to their discovery, and, I hope and\r\ntrust, finally to their utter ruin and destruction.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I am to remark to your Lordships, that the accounts\r\nhe has given of one of these sums of money are totally false and\r\ncontradictory. Now there is not a stronger presumption, nor can one\r\nwant more reason to judge a transaction fraudulent, than that the\r\naccounts given of it are contradictory; and he has given three accounts\r\nutterly irreconcilable with each other. He is asked, \"How came you to\r\ntake bonds for this money, if it was not your own? How came you to\r\nvitiate and corrupt the state of the Company's records, and to state\r\nyourself a lender to the Company, when in reality you were their\r\ndebtor?\" His answer was, \"I really cannot tell; I have forgot my\r\nreasons; the distance of time is so great,\" (namely, a time of about two\r\nyears, or not so long,) \"I cannot give an account of the matter; perhaps\r\nI had this motive, perhaps I had another,\" (but what is the most\r\ncurious,) \"perhaps I had none at all which I can now recollect.\" You\r\nshall hear the account which Mr. Hastings himself gives, his own\r\nfraudulent representation, of these corrupt transactions. \"For my\r\nmotives for withholding the several receipts from the knowledge of the\r\nCouncil, or of the Court of Directors, and for taking bonds for part of\r\nthese sums and paying others into the treasury as deposits on my own\r\naccount, I have generally accounted in my letter to the Honorable the\r\nCourt of Directors of the 22d of May, 1782,--namely, that I either chose\r\nto conceal the first receipts from public curiosity by receiving bonds\r\nfor the amount, or possibly acted without any studied design which my\r\nmemory at that distance of time could verify, and that I did not think\r\nit worth my care to observe the same means with the rest. It will not be\r\nexpected that I should be able to give a more correct explanation of my\r\nintentions after a lapse of three years, having declared at the time\r\nthat many particulars had escaped my remembrance; neither shall I\r\nattempt to add more than the clearer affirmation of the facts implied\r\nin that report of them, and such inferences as necessarily, or with a\r\nstrong probability, follow them.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see, as to any direct explanation, that he fairly gives it\r\nup: he has used artifice and stratagem, which he knows will not do; and\r\nat last attempts to cover the treachery of his conduct by the treachery\r\nof his memory. Frequent applications were made to Mr. Hastings upon this\r\narticle from the Company,--gentle hints, _gemitus columbæ_,--rather,\r\nlittle amorous complaints that he was not more open and communicative;\r\nbut all these gentle insinuations were never able to draw from him any\r\nfurther account till he came to England. When he came here, he left not\r\nonly his memory, but all his notes and references, behind in India. When\r\nin India the Company could get no account of them, because he himself\r\nwas not in England; and when he was in England, they could get no\r\naccount, because his papers were in India. He then sends over to Mr.\r\nLarkins to give that account of his affairs which he was not able to\r\ngive himself. Observe, here is a man taking money privately, corruptly,\r\nand which was to be sanctified by the future application of it, taking\r\nfalse securities to cover it, and who, when called upon to tell whom he\r\ngot the money from, for what ends, and on what occasion, neither will\r\ntell in India nor can tell in England, but sends for such an account as\r\nhe has thought proper to furnish.\r\n\r\nI am now to bring before you an account of what I think much the most\r\nserious part of the effects of his system of bribery, corruption, and\r\npeculation. My Lords, I am to state to you the astonishing and almost\r\nincredible means he made use of to lay all the country under\r\ncontribution, to bring the whole into such dejection as should put his\r\nbribes out of the way of discovery. Such another example of boldness and\r\ncontrivance I believe the world cannot furnish.\r\n\r\nI have already shown, amongst the mass of his corruptions, that he let\r\nthe whole of the lands to farm to the banians; next, that he sold the\r\nwhole Mahomedan government of that country to a woman. This was bold\r\nenough, one should think; but without entering into the circumstances of\r\nthe revenue change in 1772, I am to tell your Lordships that he had\r\nappointed six Provincial Councils, each consisting of many members, who\r\nhad the ordinary administration of civil justice in that country, and\r\nthe whole business of the collection of the revenues.\r\n\r\nThese Provincial Councils accounted to the Governor-General and Council,\r\nwho in the revenue department had the whole management, control, and\r\nregulation of the revenue. Mr. Hastings did in several papers to the\r\nCourt of Directors declare, that the establishment of these Provincial\r\nCouncils, which at first he stated only as experimental, had proved\r\nuseful in the experiment,--and on that use, and upon that experiment, he\r\nhad sent even the plan of an act of Parliament, to have it confirmed\r\nwith the last and most sacred authority of this country. The Court of\r\nDirectors desired, that, if he thought any other method more proper, he\r\nwould send it to them for their approbation.\r\n\r\nThus the whole face of the British government, the whole of its order\r\nand constitution, remained from 1772 to 1781. He had got rid, some time\r\nbefore this period, by death, of General Clavering, by death, of Colonel\r\nMonson, and by vexation and persecution, and his consequent dereliction\r\nof authority, he had shaken off Mr. Francis. The whole Council\r\nconsisting only of himself and Mr. Wheler, he, having the casting vote,\r\nwas in effect the whole Council; and if ever there was a time when\r\nprinciple, decency, and decorum rendered it improper for him to do any\r\nextraordinary acts without the sanction of the Court of Directors, that\r\nwas the time. Mr. Wheler was taken off,--despair perhaps rendering the\r\nman, who had been in opposition futilely before, compliable. The man is\r\ndead. He certainly did not oppose him; if he had, it would have been in\r\nvain. But those very circumstances which rendered it atrocious in Mr.\r\nHastings to make any change induced him to make this. He thought that a\r\nmoment's time was not to be lost,--that other colleagues might come,\r\nwhere he might be overpowered by a majority again, and not able to\r\npursue his corrupt plans. Therefore he was resolved,--your Lordships\r\nwill remark the whole of this most daring and systematic plan of bribery\r\nand peculation,--he resolved to put it out of the power of his Council\r\nin future to check or control him in any of his evil practices.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he did was to form an ostensible council at Calcutta for\r\nthe management of the revenues, which was not effectually bound, except\r\nit thought fit, to make any reference to the Supreme Council. He\r\ndelegated to them--that is, to four covenanted servants--those functions\r\nwhich by act of Parliament and the Company's orders were to be exercised\r\nby the Council-General; he delegated to four gentlemen, creatures of his\r\nown, his own powers, but he laid them out to good interest. It appears\r\nodd that one of the first acts to a Governor-General, so jealous of his\r\npower as he is known to be, as soon as he had all the power in his own\r\nhands, should be to put all the revenues out of his own control. This\r\nupon the first view is an extraordinary proceeding. His next step was,\r\nwithout apprising the Court of Directors of his intention, or without\r\nhaving given an idea of any such intention to his colleagues while\r\nalive, either those who died in India, or those who afterwards returned\r\nto Europe, in one day, in a moment, to annihilate the whole authority of\r\nthe Provincial Councils, and delegate the whole power to these four\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nThese four gentlemen had for their secretary an agent given them by Mr.\r\nHastings: a name that you will often hear of; a name at the sound of\r\nwhich all India turns pale; the most wicked, the most atrocious, the\r\nboldest, the most dexterous villain that ever the rank servitude of that\r\ncountry has produced. My Lords, I am speaking with the most assured\r\nfreedom, because there never was a friend of Mr. Hastings, there never\r\nwas a foe of Mr. Hastings, there never was any human person, that ever\r\ndiffered on this occasion, or expressed any other idea of Gunga Govind\r\nSing, the friend of Mr. Hastings, whom he intrusted with this important\r\npost. But you shall hear, from the account given by themselves, what the\r\nCouncil thought of their functions, of their efficiency for the charge,\r\nand in whose hands that efficiency really was. I beg, hope, and trust,\r\nthat your Lordships will learn from the persons themselves who were\r\nappointed to execute the office their opinion of the real execution of\r\nit, in order that you may judge of the plan for which he destroyed the\r\nwhole English administration in India.\r\n\r\n\"The Committee must have a dewan, or executive officer, call him by what\r\nname you please. This man, in fact, has all the revenue paid at the\r\nPresidency at his disposal, and can, if he has any abilities, bring all\r\nthe renters under contribution. It is little advantage to restrain the\r\nCommittee themselves from bribery or corruption, when their executive\r\nofficer has the power of practising both undetected. To display the arts\r\nemployed by a native on such occasions would fill a volume. He discovers\r\nthe secret resources of the zemindars and renters, their enemies and\r\ncompetitors; and by the engines of hope and fear, raised upon these\r\nfoundations, he can work them to his purpose. The Committee, with the\r\nbest intentions, best abilities, and steadiest application, must after\r\nall be a tool in the hands of their dewan.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see what the opinion of the Council was of their own\r\nconstitution. You see for what it was made. You see for what purposes\r\nthe great revenue trust was taken from the Council-General, from the\r\nsupreme government. You see for what purposes the executive power was\r\ndestroyed. You have it from one of the gentlemen of this commission, at\r\nfirst four in number, and afterwards five, who was the most active,\r\nefficient member of it. You see it was made for the purpose of being a\r\ntool in the hands of Gunga Govind Sing; that integrity, ability, and\r\nvigilance could avail nothing; that the whole country might be laid\r\nunder contribution by this man, and that he could thus practise bribery\r\nwith impunity. Thus your Lordships see the delegation of all the\r\nauthority of the country, above and below, is given by Mr. Hastings to\r\nthis Gunga Govind Sing. The screen, the veil, spread before this\r\ntransaction, is torn open by the very people themselves who are the\r\ntools in it. They confess they can do nothing; they know they are\r\ninstruments in the hands of Gunga Govind Sing; and Mr. Hastings uses his\r\nname and authority to make them such in the hands of the basest, the\r\nwickedest, the corruptest, the most audacious and atrocious villain ever\r\nheard of. It is to him all the English authority is sacrificed, and four\r\ngentlemen are appointed to be his tools and instruments. Tools and\r\ninstruments for what? They themselves state, that, if he has the\r\ninclination, he has the power and ability to lay the whole country under\r\ncontribution, that he enters into the most minute secrets of every\r\nindividual in it, gets into the bottom of their family affairs, and has\r\na power totally to subvert and destroy them; and we shall show upon that\r\nhead, that he well fulfilled the purposes for which he was appointed.\r\nDid Mr. Hastings pretend to say that he destroyed the Provincial\r\nCouncils for their corruptness or insufficiency, when he dissolved them?\r\nNo: he says he has no objection to their competency, no charge to make\r\nagainst their conduct, but that he has destroyed them for his new\r\narrangement. And what is his new arrangement? Gunga Govind Sing. Forty\r\nEnglish gentlemen were removed from their offices by that change. Mr.\r\nHastings did it, however, very economically; for all these gentlemen\r\nwere instantly put upon pensions, and consequently burdened the\r\nestablishment with a new charge. Well, but the new Council was formed\r\nand constituted upon a very economical principle also. These five\r\ngentlemen, you will have it in proof, with the necessary expenses of\r\ntheir office, were a charge of 62,000_l._ a year upon the establishment.\r\nBut for great, eminent, capital services, 62,000_l._, though a much\r\nlarger sum than what was thought fit to be allowed for the members of\r\nthe Supreme Council itself, may be admitted. I will pass it. It shall be\r\ngranted to Mr. Hastings, that these pensions, though they created a new\r\nburden on the establishment, were all well disposed, provided the\r\nCouncil did their duty. But you have heard what they say themselves:\r\nthey are not there put to do any duty; they can do no duty; their\r\nabilities, their integrity, avail them nothing; they are tools in the\r\nhands of Gunga Govind Sing. Mr. Hastings, then, has loaded the revenue\r\nwith 62,000_l._ a year to make Gunga Govind Sing master of the kingdoms\r\nof Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa. What must the thing to be moved be, when\r\nthe machinery, when the necessary tools, for Gunga Govind Sing have cost\r\n62,000_l._ a year to the Company? There it is; it is not my\r\nrepresentation, not the representation of observant strangers, of good\r\nand decent people, that understand the nature of that service, but the\r\nopinion of the tools themselves.\r\n\r\nNow did Mr. Hastings employ Gunga Govind Sing without a knowledge of his\r\ncharacter? His character was known to Mr. Hastings: it was recorded long\r\nbefore, when he was turned out of another office. \"During my long\r\nresidence,\" says he, \"in this country, this is the first time I heard of\r\nthe character of Gunga Govind Sing being infamous. No information I have\r\nreceived, though I have heard _many_ people speak ill of him, ever\r\npointed to any particular _act_ of infamy committed by Gunga Govind\r\nSing. I have no intimate knowledge of Gunga Govind Sing. What I\r\nunderstand of his character has been from Europeans as well as natives.\"\r\nAfter,--\"He had many enemies at the time he was proposed to be employed\r\nin the Company's service, and not _one advocate_ among the natives who\r\nhad immediate access to myself. I think, therefore, if his character had\r\nbeen such as has been described, the knowledge of it could hardly have\r\nfailed to have been ascertained to me by the _specific_ facts. I have\r\nheard him loaded, as I have many others, with general reproaches, but\r\nhave never heard any one express a doubt of _his abilities_.\" Now, if\r\nanything in the world should induce you to put the whole trust of the\r\nrevenues of Bengal, both above and below, into the hands of a single\r\nman, and to delegate to him the whole jurisdiction of the country, it\r\nmust be that he either was, or at least was reputed to be, a man of\r\nintegrity. Mr. Hastings does not pretend that he is reputed to be a man\r\nof integrity. He knew that he was not able to contradict the charge\r\nbrought against him, and that he had been turned out of office by his\r\ncolleagues, for reasons assigned upon record, and approved by the\r\nDirectors, for malversation in office. He had, indeed, crept again into\r\nthe Calcutta Committee; and they were upon the point of turning him out\r\nfor malversation, when Mr. Hastings saved them the trouble by turning\r\nout the whole Committee, consisting of a president and five members. So\r\nthat in all times, in all characters, in all places, he stood as a man\r\nof a bad character and evil repute, though supposed to be a man of great\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, permit me for one moment to drop my representative character\r\nhere, and to speak to your Lordships only as a man of some experience in\r\nthe world, and conversant with the affairs of men and with the\r\ncharacters of men.\r\n\r\nI do, then, declare my conviction, and wish it may stand recorded to\r\nposterity, that there never was a _bad man_ that had ability for _good\r\nservice_. It is not in the nature of such men; their minds are so\r\ndistorted to selfish purposes, to knavish, artificial, and crafty means\r\nof accomplishing those selfish ends, that, if put to any good service,\r\nthey are poor, dull, helpless. Their natural faculties never have that\r\ndirection; they are paralytic on that side; the muscles, if I may use\r\nthe expression, that ought to move it, are all dead. They know nothing,\r\nbut how to pursue selfish ends by wicked and indirect means. No man ever\r\nknowingly employed a bad man on account of his abilities, but for evil\r\nends. Mr. Hastings knew this man to be bad; all the world knew him to be\r\nbad; and how did he employ him? In such a manner as that he might be\r\ncontrolled by others? A great deal might be said for him, if this had\r\nbeen the case. There might be circumstances in which such a man might be\r\nused in a subordinate capacity. But who ever thought of putting such a\r\nman virtually in possession of the whole authority both of the Committee\r\nand the Council-General, and of the revenues of the whole country?\r\n\r\nAs soon as we find Gunga Govind Sing here, we find him employed in the\r\nway in which he was meant to be employed: that is to say, we find him\r\nemployed in taking corrupt bribes and corrupt presents for Mr. Hastings.\r\nThough the Committee were tools in his hands, he was a tool in the hands\r\nof Mr. Hastings; for he had, as we shall prove, constant, uniform, and\r\nclose communications with Mr. Hastings. And, indeed, we may be saved a\r\ngood deal of the trouble of proof; for Mr. Hastings himself, by\r\nacknowledging him to be his bribe-broker, has pretty well authenticated\r\na secret correspondence between them. For the next great bribe as yet\r\ndiscovered to be taken by Mr. Hastings, about the time of his great\r\noperation of 1781, was the bribe of 40,000_l._, which we charge to have\r\nbeen privately taken from one of two persons, but from which is not yet\r\nascertained, but paid to him through this flagitious black agent of his\r\niniquities, Gunga Govind Sing. The discovery is made by another agent of\r\nhis, called Mr. Larkins, one of his white bribe-confidants, and by him\r\nmade Accountant-General to the Supreme Presidency. For this sum, so\r\nclandestinely and corruptly taken, he received a bond to himself, on his\r\nown account, as for money lent to the Company. For, upon the frequent,\r\npressing, tender solicitations of the Court of Directors, always\r\ninsinuated to him in a very delicate manner, Mr. Hastings had written to\r\nMr. Larkins to find out, if he could, some of his own bribes; and\r\naccordingly Mr. Larkins sent over an account of various bribes,--an\r\naccount which, even before it comes directly in evidence before you, it\r\nwill be pleasant to your Lordships to read. In this account, under the\r\nhead, \"_Dinagepore, No. 1_,\" I find \"_Duplicate copy of the particulars\r\nof debts, in which the component parts of sundry sums received on the\r\naccount of the Honorable Company of Merchants trading to the East Indies\r\nwere received by Mr. Hastings and paid to the Sub-Treasurer_.\" We find\r\nhere, \"_Dinagepore peshcush, four lacs of rupees, cabooleat_\": that is,\r\nan agreement to pay four lacs of rupees, of which three were received\r\nand one remained in balance at the time this account was made out. All\r\nthat we can learn from this account, after all our researches, after all\r\nthe Court of Directors could do to squeeze it out of him, is, that he\r\nreceived from Dinagepore, at twelve monthly payments, a sum of about\r\nthree lacs of rupees, upon an engagement to pay him four; that is, he\r\nreceived about 30,000_l._ out of 40,000_l._ which was to be paid him:\r\nand we are told that he received this sum through the hands of Gunga\r\nGovind Sing; and that he was exceedingly angry with Gunga Govind Sing\r\nfor having kept back or defrauded him of the sum of 10,000_l._ out of\r\nthe 40,000_l._ To keep back from him the fourth part of the whole bribe\r\nwas very reprehensible behavior in Gunga Govind Sing, certainly very\r\nunworthy of the great and high trust which Mr. Hastings reposed in his\r\nintegrity. My Lords, this letter tells us Mr. Hastings was much\r\nirritated at Gunga Govind Sing. You will hereafter see how Mr. Hastings\r\nbehaves to persons against whom he is irritated for their frauds upon\r\nhim in their joint concerns. In the mean time Gunga Govind Sing rests\r\nwith you as a person with whom Mr. Hastings is displeased on account of\r\ninfidelity in the honorable trust of bribe undertaker and manager.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you are not very much enlightened, I believe, by seeing these\r\nwords, _Dinagepore peshcush_. We find a province, we find a sum of\r\nmoney, we find an agent, and we find a receiver. The _province_ is\r\n_Dinagepore_, the _agent_ is _Gunga Govind Sing_, the _sum_ agreed on is\r\n40,000_l._, and the _receiver_ of a part of that is _Mr. Hastings_. This\r\nis all that can be seen. Who it was that gave this sum of money to Mr.\r\nHastings in this manner does no way appear; it is _murder by persons\r\nunknown_: and this is the way in which Mr. Hastings, after all the\r\nreiterated solicitations of Parliament, of the Company, and the public,\r\nhas left the account of this bribe.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, now see what was the state of transactions at\r\nDinagepore at that period. For, if Mr. Hastings in the transactions at\r\nthat period did anything for that country, it must be presumed this\r\nmoney was given for those acts; for Mr. Hastings confesses it was a sum\r\nof money corruptly received, but honestly applied. It does not signify\r\nmuch, at first view, from whom he received it; it is enough to fix upon\r\nhim that he did receive it. But because the consequences of his bribes\r\nmake the main part of what I intend to bring before your Lordships, I\r\nshall beg to state to you, with your indulgence, what I have been able\r\nto discover by a very close investigation of the records respecting this\r\nbusiness of Dinagepore.\r\n\r\nDinagepore, Rungpore, and Edrackpore make a country, I believe, pretty\r\nnearly as large as all the northern counties of England, Yorkshire\r\nincluded. It is no mean country, and it has a prince of great, ancient,\r\nillustrious descent at the head of it, called the Rajah of Dinagepore.\r\n\r\nI find, that, about the month of July, 1780, the Rajah of Dinagepore,\r\nafter a long and lingering illness, died, leaving an half-brother and an\r\nadopted son. A litigation respecting the succession instantly arose in\r\nthe family; and this litigation was of course referred to, and was\r\nfinally to be decided by, the Governor-General in Council,--being the\r\nultimate authority to which the decision of all these questions was to\r\nbe referred. This cause came before Mr. Hastings, and I find that he\r\ndecided the question in favor of the adopted son of the Rajah against\r\nhis half-brother. I find that upon that decision a rent was settled, and\r\na peshcush, or fine, paid. So that all that is in this transaction is\r\nfair and above-board: there is a dispute settled; there is a fine paid;\r\nthere is a rent reserved to the Company; and the whole is a fair\r\nsettlement. But I find along with it very extraordinary acts; for I find\r\nMr. Hastings taking part in favor of the minor, agreeably to the\r\nprinciples of others, and contrary to his own. I find that he gave the\r\nguardianship of this adopted son to the brother of the Ranny, as she is\r\ncalled, or the widow of the deceased Rajah; and though the hearing and\r\nsettling of this business was actually a part of the duty of his office,\r\nyet I find, that, when the steward of the province of Dinagepore was\r\ncoming down to represent this case to Mr. Hastings, Mr. Hastings, on\r\npretence that it would only tend to increase the family dissensions, so\r\nfar from hearing fully all the parties in this business, not only sent\r\nhim back, but ordered him to be actually turned out of his office. If,\r\nthen, the 40,000_l._ be the same with the money taken from the Rajah in\r\n1780, to which account it seems to refer, (for it was taken in regular\r\npayments, beginning July, 1780, and ending at the same period in 1781,)\r\nit was a sum of money corruptly taken by him as a judge in a litigation\r\nof inheritance between two great parties. So that he received the sum of\r\n40,000_l._ for a judgment; which, whether that judgment was right or\r\nwrong, true or false, he corruptly received.\r\n\r\nThis sum was received, as your Lordships will observe, through Gunga\r\nGovind Sing. He was the broker of the agreement: he was the person who\r\nwas to receive it by monthly instalments, and he was to pay it to Mr.\r\nHastings. His son was in the office of Register-General of the whole\r\ncountry, who had in his custody all the papers, documents, and\r\neverything which could tend to settle a litigation among the parties. If\r\nMr. Hastings took this bribe from the Rajah of Dinagepore, he took a\r\nbribe from an infant of five years old through the hands of the\r\nRegister. That is, the judge receives a bribe through the hands of the\r\nkeeper of the genealogies of the family, the records and other\r\ndocuments, which must have had the principal share in settling the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThis history of this Dinagepore peshcush is the public one received by\r\nthe Company, and which is entered upon the record,--but not the private,\r\nand probably the true history of this corrupt transaction.\r\n\r\nVery soon after this decision, very soon after this peshcush was given,\r\nwe find all the officers of the young Rajah, who was supposed to have\r\ngiven it, turned out of their employment by Gunga Govind Sing,--by the\r\nvery man who received the peshcush for Mr. Hastings. We find them all\r\nturned out of their employments; we find them all accused, without any\r\nappearance or trace in the records of any proof of embezzlement, of\r\nneglect in the education of the minor Rajah, of the mismanagement of his\r\naffairs, or the allotment of an unsuitable allowance. And accordingly,\r\nto prevent the relations of his adopted mother, to prevent those who\r\nmight be supposed to have an immediate interest in the family, from\r\nabusing the trust of his education and the trust of the management of\r\nhis fortune, Gunga Govind Sing, (for I trust your Lordships would not\r\nsuffer me, if I had a mind, to quote that tool of a thing, the Committee\r\nof Revenue, bought at 62,000_l._ a year,--you would not suffer me to\r\nname it, especially when you know all the secret agency of bribes in the\r\nhand of Gunga Govind Sing,)--this Gunga Govind Sing produces soon after\r\nanother character, to whom he consigns the custody of the whole family\r\nand the whole province.\r\n\r\nI will do Mr. Hastings the justice to say, that, if he had known there\r\nwas another man more accomplished in all iniquity than Gunga Govind\r\nSing, he would not have given him the first place in his confidence. But\r\nthere is another next to him in the country, whom you are to hear of\r\nby-and-by, called Debi Sing. This person, in the universal opinion of\r\nall Bengal, is ranked next to Gunga Govind Sing; and, what is very\r\ncurious, they have been recorded by Mr. Hastings as rivals in the same\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\n                Arcades ambo,\r\n    Et cantare pares, et respondere parati.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Hastings has the happiest modes in the world: these rivals were\r\nreconciled on this occasion, and Gunga Govind Sing appoints Debi Sing,\r\nsuperseding all the other officers for no reason whatever upon record.\r\nAnd because, like champions, they ought to go in pairs, there is an\r\nEnglish gentleman, one Mr. Goodlad, whom you will hear of presently,\r\nappointed along with him. Absolute strangers to the Rajah's family, the\r\nfirst act they do is to cut off a thousand out of sixteen hundred a\r\nmonth from his allowance. They state (though there was a great number of\r\ndependants to maintain) that six hundred would be enough to maintain\r\nhim. There appears in the account of these proceedings to be such a\r\nflutter about the care of the Rajah, and the management of his\r\nhousehold: in short, that there never was such a tender guardianship as,\r\nalways with the knowledge of Mr. Hastings, is exercised over this poor\r\nRajah, who had just given (if he did give) 40,000_l._ for _his own_\r\ninheritance, if it was his due,--for the inheritance of _others_, if it\r\nwas not his due. One would think he was entitled to some mercy; but,\r\nprobably because the money could not otherwise be supplied, his\r\nestablishment was cut down by Debi Sing and Mr. Goodlad a thousand a\r\nmonth, which is just twelve thousand a year.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hastings had appointed those persons to the guardianship who\r\nhad an interest in the management of the Rajah's education and fortune,\r\none should have thought, before they were turned out, he would at least\r\nhave examined whether such a step was proper or not. No: they were\r\nturned out without any such examination; and when I come to inquire into\r\nthe proceedings of Gunga Govind Sing's Committee, I do not find that the\r\nnew guardians have brought to account one single shilling they received,\r\nappointed as they were by that council newly made to superintend all the\r\naffairs of the Rajah. There is not one word to be found of an account:\r\nDebi Sing's honor, fidelity, and disinterestedness, and that of Mr.\r\nGoodlad, is sufficient; and that is the way in which the management and\r\nsuperintendence of one of the greatest houses in that country is given\r\nto the guardianship of strangers. And how is it managed? We find Debi\r\nSing in possession of the Rajah's family, in possession of his affairs,\r\nin the management of his whole zemindary; and in the course of the next\r\nyear he is to give him in farm the whole of the revenues of these three\r\nprovinces. Now whether the peshcush was received for the nomination of\r\nthe Rajah as a bribe in judgment, or whether Mr. Hastings got it from\r\nDebi Sing as a bribe in office, for appointing him to the guardianship\r\nof a family that did not belong to him, and for the dominion of three\r\ngreat and once wealthy provinces,--(which is best or worst I shall not\r\npretend to determine,)--you find the Rajah in his possession; you find\r\nhis education, his household, in his possession; the public revenues are\r\nin his possession; they are given over to him.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the records, the letting of these provinces appears to\r\nhave been carried on by the new Committee of Revenue, as the course and\r\norder of business required it should. But by the investigation into Mr.\r\nHastings's money transactions, the insufficiency and fallacy of these\r\nrecords is manifest beyond a doubt. From this investigation it is\r\ndiscovered that it was in reality a bargain secretly struck between the\r\nGovernor-General and Debi Sing, and that the Committee were only\r\nemployed in the mere official forms. From the time that Mr. Hastings\r\nnew-modelled the revenue system, nothing is seen in its true shape. We\r\nnow know, in spite of the fallacy of these records, who the true grantor\r\nwas: it will not be amiss to go a little further in supplying their\r\ndefects, and to inquire a little concerning the grantee. This makes it\r\nnecessary for me to inform your Lordships who Debi Sing is.\r\n\r\n     [_Mr. Burke read the Committee's recommendation of Debi Sing to the\r\n     Governor-General and Council; but the copy of the paper alluded to\r\n     is wanting._]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is a choice; here is Debi Sing presented for his knowledge in\r\nbusiness, his trust and fidelity, and that he is a person against whom\r\nno objection can be made. This is presented to Mr. Hastings, by him\r\nrecorded in the Council Books, and by him transmitted to the Court of\r\nDirectors. Mr. Hastings has since recorded, that he knew this Debi Sing,\r\n(though he here publicly authorizes the nomination of him to all that\r\ngreat body of trusts,)--that he knew him to be a man completely capable\r\nof the most atrocious iniquities that were ever charged upon man. Debi\r\nSing is appointed to all those great trusts, through the means of Gunga\r\nGovind Sing, from whom he (Mr. Hastings) had received 30,000_l._ as a\r\npart of a bribe.\r\n\r\nNow, though it is a large field, though it is a thing that I must\r\nconfess I feel a reluctance almost in venturing to undertake, exhausted\r\nas I am, yet such is the magnitude of the affair, such the evil\r\nconsequences that followed from a system of bribery, such the horrible\r\nconsequences of superseding all the persons in office in the country to\r\ngive it into the hands of Debi Sing, that, though it is the public\r\nopinion, and though no man that has ever heard the name of Debi Sing\r\ndoes not know that he was only second to Gunga Govind Sing, yet it is\r\nnot to my purpose, unless I prove that Mr. Hastings knew his character\r\nat the very time he accepts him as a person against whom no exception\r\ncould be made.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to inform your Lordships who this Debi Sing was, to whom\r\nthese great trusts were committed, and those great provinces given.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought, and not unnaturally, that, in this sort of corrupt\r\nand venal appointment to high trust and office, Mr. Hastings has no\r\nother consideration than the money he received. But whoever thinks so\r\nwill be deceived. Mr. Hastings was very far from indifferent to the\r\ncharacter of the persons he dealt with. On the contrary, he made a most\r\ncareful selection; he had a very scrupulous regard to the aptitude of\r\nthe men for the purposes for which he employed them, and was much guided\r\nby his experience of their conduct in those offices which had been sold\r\nto them upon former occasions.\r\n\r\nExcept Gunga Govind Sing, (whom, as justice required, Mr. Hastings\r\ndistinguished by the highest marks of his confidence,) there was not a\r\nman in Bengal, perhaps not upon earth, a match for this Debi Sing. He\r\nwas not an unknown subject, not one rashly taken up as an experiment. He\r\nwas a tried man; and if there had been one more desperately and\r\nabandonedly corrupt, more wildly and flagitiously oppressive, to be\r\nfound unemployed in India, large as his offers were, Mr. Hastings would\r\nnot have taken this money from Debi Sing.\r\n\r\nDebi Sing was one of those who in the early stages of the English power\r\nin Bengal attached himself to those natives who then stood high in\r\noffice. He courted Mahomed Reza Khân, a Mussulman of the highest rank,\r\nof the tribe of Koreish, whom I have already mentioned, then at the head\r\nof the revenue, and now at the head of the criminal justice of Bengal,\r\nwith all the supple assiduity of which those who possess no valuable art\r\nor useful talent are commonly complete masters. Possessing large funds,\r\nacquired by his apprenticeship and novitiate in the lowest frauds, he\r\nwas enabled to lend to this then powerful man, in the several\r\nemergencies of his variable fortune, very large sums of money. This\r\ngreat man had been brought down by Mr. Hastings, under the orders of the\r\nCourt of Directors, upon a cruel charge, to Calcutta. He was accused of\r\nmany crimes, and acquitted, 220,000_l._ in debt: that is to say, as soon\r\nas he was a great debtor, he ceased to be a great criminal.\r\n\r\nDebi Sing obtained by his services no slight influence over Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân, a person of a character very different from his.\r\n\r\nFrom that connection he was appointed to the farm of the revenue, and\r\ninclusively of the government of Purneah, a province of very great\r\nextent, and then in a state of no inconsiderable opulence. In this\r\noffice he exerted his talents with so much vigor and industry that in a\r\nvery short time the province was half depopulated and totally ruined.\r\n\r\nThe farm, on the expiration of his lease, was taken by a set of\r\nadventurers in this kind of traffic from Calcutta. But when the new\r\nundertakers came to survey the object of their future operations and\r\nfuture profits, they were so shocked at the hideous and squalid scenes\r\nof misery and desolation that glared upon them in every quarter, that\r\nthey instantly fled out of the country, and thought themselves but too\r\nhappy to be permitted, on the payment of a penalty of twelve thousand\r\npounds, to be released from their engagements.\r\n\r\nTo give in a few words as clear an idea as I am able to give of the\r\nimmense volume which might be composed of the vexations, violence, and\r\nrapine of that tyrannical administration, the territorial revenue of\r\nPurneah, which had been let to Debi Sing at the rate of 160,000_l._\r\nsterling a year, was with difficulty leased for a yearly sum under\r\n90,000_l._, and with all rigor of exaction produced in effect little\r\nmore than 60,000_l._, falling greatly below one half of its original\r\nestimate: so entirely did the administration of Debi Sing exhaust all\r\nthe resources of the province; so totally did his baleful influence\r\nblast the very hope and spring of all future revenue.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Debi Sing was too notoriously destructive not to\r\ncause a general clamor. It was impossible that it should be passed over\r\nwithout animadversion. Accordingly, in the month of September, 1772, Mr.\r\nHastings, then at the head of the Committee of Circuit, removed him for\r\nmaladministration; and he has since publicly declared on record that he\r\nknew him to be capable of all the most horrid and atrocious crimes that\r\ncan be imputed to man.\r\n\r\nThis brand, however, was only a mark for Mr. Hastings to find him out\r\nhereafter in the crowd, to identify him for his own, and to call him\r\nforth into action, when his virtues should be sufficiently matured for\r\nthe services in which he afterwards employed him, through his\r\ninstruments, Mr. Anderson and Gunga Govind Sing. In the mean time he\r\nleft Debi Sing to the direction of his own good genius.\r\n\r\nDebi Sing was stigmatized in the Company's records, his reputation was\r\ngone, but his funds were safe. In the arrangement made by Mr. Hastings,\r\nin the year 1773, by which Provincial Councils were formed, Debi Sing\r\nbecame deputy-steward, or secretary, (soon in effect and influence\r\nprincipal steward,) to the Provincial Council of Moorshedabad, the seat\r\nof the old government, and the first province of the kingdom; and to his\r\ncharge were committed various extensive and populous provinces, yielding\r\nan annual revenue of one hundred and twenty lacs of rupees, or\r\n1,500,000_l._ This division of Provincial Council included Rungpore,\r\nEdrackpore, and others, where he obtained such a knowledge of their\r\nresources as subsequently to get possession of them.\r\n\r\nDebi Sing found this administration composed mostly of young men,\r\ndissipated and fond of pleasure, as is usual at that time of life, but\r\ndesirous of reconciling those pleasures, which usually consume wealth,\r\nwith the means of making a great and speedy fortune,--at once eager\r\ncandidates for opulence, and perfect novices in all the roads that lead\r\nto it. Debi Sing commiserated their youth and inexperience, and took\r\nupon him to be their guide.\r\n\r\nThere is a revenue in that country, raised by a tax more productive than\r\nlaudable. It is an imposition on public prostitutes, a duty upon the\r\nsocieties of dancing-girls,--those seminaries from which Mr. Hastings\r\nhas selected an administrator of justice and governor of kingdoms. Debi\r\nSing thought it expedient to farm this tax,--not only because he\r\nneglected no sort of gain, but because he regarded it as no contemptible\r\nmeans of power and influence. Accordingly, in plain terms, he opened a\r\nlegal brothel, out of which he carefully reserved (you may be sure) the\r\nvery flower of his collection for the entertainment of his young\r\nsuperiors: ladies recommended not only by personal merit, but, according\r\nto the Eastern custom, by sweet and enticing names which he had given\r\nthem. For, if they were to be translated, they would sound,--Riches of\r\nmy Life, Wealth of my Soul, Treasure of Perfection, Diamond of Splendor,\r\nPearl of Price, Ruby of Pure Blood, and other metaphorical descriptions,\r\nthat, calling up dissonant passions to enhance the value of the general\r\nharmony, heightened the attractions of love with the allurements of\r\navarice. A moving seraglio of these ladies always attended his progress,\r\nand were always brought to the splendid and multiplied entertainments\r\nwith which he regaled his Council. In these festivities, whilst his\r\nguests were engaged with the seductions of beauty, the intoxications of\r\nthe most delicious wines of France, and the voluptuous vapor of perfumed\r\nIndia smoke, uniting the vivid satisfactions of Europe with the torpid\r\nblandishments of Asia, the great magician himself, chaste in the midst\r\nof dissoluteness, sober in the centre of debauch, vigilant in the lap of\r\nnegligence and oblivion, attended with an eagle's eye the moment for\r\nthrusting in business, and at such times was able to carry without\r\ndifficulty points of shameful enormity, which at other hours he would\r\nnot so much as have dared to mention to his employers, young men rather\r\ncareless and inexperienced than intentionally corrupt. Not satisfied\r\nwith being pander to their pleasures, he anticipated and was purveyor to\r\ntheir wants, and supplied them with a constant command of money; and by\r\nthese means he reigned with an uncontrolled dominion over the province\r\nand over its governors.\r\n\r\nFor you are to understand that in many things we are very much\r\nmisinformed with regard to the true seat of power in India. Whilst we\r\nwere proudly calling India a British government, it was in substance a\r\ngovernment of the lowest, basest, and most flagitious of the native\r\nrabble, to whom the far greater part of the English who figured in\r\nemployment and station had from their earliest youth been slaves and\r\ninstruments. Banians had anticipated the period of their power in\r\npremature advances of money, and have ever after obtained the entire\r\ndominion over their nominal masters.\r\n\r\nBy these various ways and means Debi Sing contrived to add job to job,\r\nemployment to employment, and to hold, besides the farms of two very\r\nconsiderable districts, various trusts in the revenue,--sometimes\r\nopenly appearing, sometimes hid two or three deep in false names,\r\nemerging into light or shrouding himself in darkness, as successful or\r\ndefeated crimes rendered him bold or cautious. Every one of these trusts\r\nwas marked with its own fraud; and for one of those frauds, committed by\r\nhim in another name, by which he became deeply in balance to the\r\nrevenue, he was publicly whipped _by proxy_.\r\n\r\nAll this while Mr. Hastings kept his eye upon him, and attended to his\r\nprogress. But as he rose in Mr. Hastings's opinion, he fell in that of\r\nhis immediate employers. By degrees, as reason prevailed, and the fumes\r\nof pleasure evaporated, the Provincial Council emerged from their first\r\ndependence, and, finding nothing but infamy attending the councils and\r\nservices of such a man, resolved to dismiss him. In this strait and\r\ncrisis of his power the artist turned himself into all shapes. He\r\noffered great sums individually, he offered them collectively, and at\r\nlast put a _carte blanche_ on the table,--all to no purpose. \"What are\r\nyou?--stones? Have I not men to deal with? Will flesh and blood refuse\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\nWhen Debi Sing found that the Council had entirely escaped, and were\r\nproof against his offers, he left them with a sullen and menacing\r\nsilence. He applied where he had good intelligence that these offers\r\nwould be well received, and that he should at once be revenged of the\r\nCouncil, and obtain all the ends which through them he had sought in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation or scruple Mr. Hastings sold a set of innocent\r\nofficers,--sold his fellow-servants of the Company, entitled by every\r\nduty to his protection,--sold English subjects, recommended by every tie\r\nof national sympathy,--sold the honor of the British government\r\nitself,--without charge, without complaint, without allegation of crime\r\nin conduct, or of insufficiency in talents: he sold them to the most\r\nknown and abandoned character which the rank servitude of that clime\r\nproduces. For _him_ he entirely broke and quashed the Council of\r\nMoorshedabad, which had been the settled government for twelve years, (a\r\nlong period in the changeful history of India,)--at a time, too, when it\r\nhad acquired a great degree of consistency, an official experience, a\r\nknowledge and habit of business, and was making full amends for early\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\nFor now Mr. Hastings, having buried Colonel Monson and General\r\nClavering, and having shaken off Mr. Francis, who retired half dead from\r\noffice, began at length to respire; he found elbow-room once more to\r\ndisplay his genuine nature and disposition, and to make amends in a riot\r\nand debauch of peculation for the forced abstinence to which he was\r\nreduced during the usurped dominion of honor and integrity.\r\n\r\nIt was not enough that the English were thus sacrificed to the revenge\r\nof Debi Sing. It was necessary to deliver over the natives to his\r\navarice. By the intervention of bribe-brokerage he united the two great\r\nrivals in iniquity, who before, from an emulation of crimes, were\r\nenemies to each other,--Gunga Govind Sing and Debi Sing. He negotiated\r\nthe bribe and the farm of the latter through the former; and Debi Sing\r\nwas invested in farm for two years with the three provinces of\r\nDinagepore, Edrackpore, and Rungpore,--territories making together a\r\ntract of land superior in dimensions to the northern counties of\r\nEngland, Yorkshire included.\r\n\r\nTo prevent anything which might prove an obstacle on the full swing of\r\nhis genius, he removed all the restraints which had been framed to give\r\nan ostensible credit, to give some show of official order, to the plans\r\nof revenue administration framed from time to time in Bengal. An\r\nofficer, called a _dewan_, had been established in the provinces,\r\nexpressly as a check on the person who should act as farmer-general.\r\nThis office he conferred along with that of farmer-general on Debi Sing,\r\nin order that Debi might become an effectual check upon Sing; and thus\r\nthese provinces, without inspection, without control, without law, and\r\nwithout magistrates, were delivered over by Mr. Hastings, bound hand and\r\nfoot, to the discretion of the man whom he had before recorded as the\r\ndestroyer of Purneah, and capable of every the most atrocious wickedness\r\nthat could be imputed to man.\r\n\r\nFatally for the natives of India, every wild project and every corrupt\r\nsale of Mr. Hastings, and those whose example he followed, is covered\r\nwith a pretended increase of revenue to the Company. Mr. Hastings would\r\nnot pocket his bribe of 40,000_l._ for himself without letting the\r\nCompany in as a sharer and accomplice. For the province of Rungpore, the\r\nobject to which I mean in this instance to confine your attention,\r\n7,000_l._ a year was added. But lest this avowed increase of rent should\r\nseem to lead to oppression, great and religious care was taken in the\r\ncovenant so stipulated with Debi Sing, that _this_ increase should not\r\narise from any additional assessment whatsoever on the country, but\r\nsolely from improvements in the cultivation, and the encouragement to be\r\ngiven to the landholder and husbandman. But as Mr. Hastings's bribe, of\r\na far greater sum, was not guarded by any such provision, it was left to\r\nthe discretion of the donor in what manner he was to indemnify himself\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nDebi Sing fixed the seat of his authority at Dinagepore, where, as soon\r\nas he arrived, he did not lose a moment in doing his duty. If Mr.\r\nHastings can forget his covenant, you may easily believe that Debi Sing\r\nhad not a more correct memory; and accordingly, as soon as he came into\r\nthe province, he instantly broke every covenant which he had entered\r\ninto as a restraint on his avarice, rapacity, and tyranny, which, from\r\nthe highest of the nobility and gentry to the lowest husbandmen, were\r\nafterwards exercised, with a stern and unrelenting impartiality, upon\r\nthe whole people. For, notwithstanding the province before Debi Sing's\r\nlease was, from various causes, in a state of declension, and in balance\r\nfor the revenue of the preceding year, at his very first entrance into\r\noffice he forced from the zemindars or landed gentry an enormous\r\nincrease of their tribute. They refused compliance. On this refusal he\r\nthrew the whole body of zemindars into prison, and thus in bonds and\r\nfetters compelled them to sign their own ruin by an increase of rent\r\nwhich they knew they could never realize. Having thus gotten them under,\r\nhe added exaction to exaction, so that every day announced some new and\r\nvaried demand, until, exhausted by these oppressions, they were brought\r\nto the extremity to which he meant to drive them, the sale of their\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe lands held by the zemindars of that country are of many\r\ndescriptions. The first and most general are those that pay revenue; the\r\nothers are of the nature of demesne lands, which are free, and pay no\r\nrent to government. The latter are for the immediate support of the\r\nzemindars and their families,--as from the former they derive their\r\ninfluence, authority, and the means of upholding their dignity. The\r\nlands of the former description were immediately attached, sequestered,\r\nand sold for the most trifling consideration. The rent-free lands, the\r\nbest and richest lands of the whole province, were sold,--sold for--what\r\ndo your Lordships think? They were sold for less than one year's\r\npurchase,--at less than one year's purchase, at the most underrated\r\nvalue; so that the fee-simple of an English acre of rent-free land sold\r\nat the rate of seven or eight shillings. Such a sale, on such terms,\r\nstrongly indicated the purchaser. And how did it turn out in fact? The\r\npurchaser was the very agent and instrument of Mr. Hastings, Debi Sing\r\nhimself. He made the exaction; he forced the sale; he reduced the rate;\r\nand he became the purchaser at less than one year's purchase, and paid\r\nwith the very money which he had extorted from the miserable vendors.\r\n\r\nWhen he had thus sold and separated these lands, he united the whole\r\nbody of them, amounting to about 7,000_l._ sterling a year (but,\r\naccording to the rate of money and living in that country, equivalent to\r\na rental in England of 30,000_l._ a year); and then having raised in the\r\nnew letting, as on the sale he had fraudulently reduced those lands, he\r\nreserved them as an estate for himself, or to whomsoever resembling\r\nhimself Mr. Hastings should order them to be disposed.\r\n\r\nThe lands, thus sold for next to nothing, left of course the late\r\nlandholder still in debt. The failure of fund, the rigorous exaction of\r\ndebt, and the multiplication of new arbitrary taxes next carried off the\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nThere is a circumstance attending this business which will call for\r\nyour Lordships' pity. Most of the landholders or zemindars in that\r\ncountry happened at that time to be women. The sex there is in a state\r\ncertainly resembling imprisonment, but guarded as a sacred treasure with\r\nall possible attention and respect. None of the coarse male hands of the\r\nlaw can reach them; but they have a custom, very cautiously used in all\r\ngood governments there, of employing female bailiffs or sergeants in the\r\nexecution of the law, where that sex is concerned. Guards, therefore,\r\nsurrounded the houses; and then female sergeants and bailiffs entered\r\ninto the habitations of these female zemindars, and held their goods and\r\npersons in execution,--nothing being left but what was daily threatened,\r\ntheir life and honor. The landholders, even women of eminent rank and\r\ncondition, (for such the greatest part of the zemindars then were,) fled\r\nfrom the ancient seats of their ancestors, and left their miserable\r\nfollowers and servants, who in that country are infinitely numerous,\r\nwithout protection and without bread. The monthly instalment of Mr.\r\nHastings's bribe was become due, and his rapacity must be fed from the\r\nvitals of the people.\r\n\r\nThe zemindars, before their own flight, had the mortification to see all\r\nthe lands assigned to charitable and to religious uses, the humane and\r\npious foundations of themselves and their ancestors, made to support\r\ninfirmity and decrepitude, to give feet to the lame and eyes to the\r\nblind, and to effect which they had deprived themselves of many of the\r\nenjoyments of life, cruelly sequestered and sold at the same market of\r\nviolence and fraud where their demesne possessions and their goods had\r\nbeen before made away with. Even the lands and funds set aside for\r\ntheir funeral ceremonies, in which they hoped to find an end to their\r\nmiseries, and some indemnity of imagination for all the substantial\r\nsufferings of their lives,--even the very feeble consolations of death,\r\nwere, by the same rigid hand of tyranny,--a tyranny more consuming than\r\nthe funeral pile, more greedy than the grave, and more inexorable than\r\ndeath itself,--seized and taken to make good the honor of corruption and\r\nthe faith of bribery pledged to Mr. Hastings or his instruments.\r\n\r\nThus it fared with the better and middling orders of the people. Were\r\nthe lower, the more industrious, spared? Alas! as their situation was\r\nfar more helpless, their oppression was infinitely more sore and\r\ngrievous, the exactions yet more excessive, the demand yet more\r\nvexatious, more capricious, more arbitrary. To afford your Lordships\r\nsome idea of the condition of those who were served up to satisfy Mr.\r\nHastings's hunger and thirst for bribes, I shall read it to you in the\r\nvery words of the representative tyrant himself, Rajah Debi Sing. Debi\r\nSing, when he was charged with a fraudulent sale of the ornaments of\r\ngold and silver of women, who, according to the modes of that country,\r\nhad starved themselves to decorate their unhappy persons, argued on the\r\nimprobability of this part of the charge in these very words.\r\n\r\n\"It is notorious,\" says he, \"that poverty generally prevails amongst the\r\nhusbandmen of Rungpore, more perhaps than in any other parts of the\r\ncountry. They are seldom possessed of any property, except at the time\r\nthey reap their harvest; and at others barely procure their subsistence.\r\nAnd this is the cause that such numbers of them were swept away by the\r\nfamine. Their effects are only a little earthen-ware, and their houses\r\nonly a handful of straw, the sale of a _thousand_ of which would not\r\nperhaps produce twenty shillings.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the opulent people from whose superfluities Mr. Hastings was\r\nto obtain a gift of 40,000_l._, over and above a large increase of rent,\r\nover and above the exactions by which the farmer must reimburse himself\r\nfor the advance of the money by which he must obtain the natural profit\r\nof the farm as well as supply the peculium of his own avarice.\r\n\r\nTherefore your Lordships will not be surprised at the consequences. All\r\nthis unhappy race of little farmers and tillers of the soil were driven\r\nlike a herd of cattle by his extortioners, and compelled by\r\nimprisonments, by fetters, and by cruel whippings, to engage for more\r\nthan the whole of their substance or possible acquisition.\r\n\r\nOver and above this, there was no mode of extortion, which the inventive\r\nimagination of rapacity could contrive, that was not contrived, and was\r\nnot put in practice. On its own day your Lordships will hear, with\r\nastonishment, detestation, and horror, the detail of these tyrannous\r\ninventions; and it will appear that the aggregate of these superadded\r\ndemands amounted to as great a sum as the whole of the compulsory rent\r\non which they were piled.\r\n\r\nThe country being in many parts left wholly waste and in all parts\r\nconsiderably depopulated by the first rigors, the full rate of the\r\ndistrict was exacted from the miserable survivors. Their burdens were\r\nincreased, as their fellow-laborers, to whose joint efforts they were to\r\nowe the means of payment, diminished. Driven to make payments beyond all\r\npossible calculation, previous to receipts and above their means, in a\r\nvery short time they fell into the hands of usurers.\r\n\r\nThe usurers, who under such a government held their own funds by a\r\nprecarious tenure, and were to lend to those whose substance was still\r\nmore precarious, to the natural hardness and austerity of that race of\r\nmen had additional motives to extortion, and made their terms\r\naccordingly. And what were the terms these poor people were obliged to\r\nconsent to, to answer the bribes and peshcush paid to Mr.\r\nHastings?--five, ten, twenty, forty per cent? No! at an interest of six\r\nhundred per cent per annum, payable by the day! A tiller of land to pay\r\nsix hundred per cent to discharge the demands of government! What\r\nexhaustless fund of opulence could supply this destructive resource of\r\nwretchedness and misery? Accordingly, the husbandman ground to powder\r\nbetween the usurer below and the oppressor above, the whole crop of the\r\ncountry was forced at once to market; and the market glutted,\r\novercharged, and suffocated, the price of grain fell to the fifth part\r\nof its usual value. The crop was then gone, but the debt remained. An\r\nuniversal treasury extent and process of execution followed on the\r\ncattle and stock, and was enforced with more or less rigor in every\r\nquarter. We have it in evidence, that in those sales five cows were sold\r\nfor not more than seven or eight shillings. All other things were\r\ndepreciated in the same proportion. The sale of the instruments of\r\nhusbandry succeeded to that of the corn and stock. Instances there are,\r\nwhere, all other things failing, the farmers were dragged from the court\r\nto their houses, in order to see them first plundered, and then burnt\r\ndown before their faces. It was not a rigorous collection of revenue, it\r\nwas a savage war made upon the country.\r\n\r\nThe peasants were left little else than their families and their bodies.\r\nThe families were disposed of. It is a known observation, that those who\r\nhave the fewest of all other worldly enjoyments are the most tenderly\r\nattached to their children and wives. The most tender of parents sold\r\ntheir children at market. The most fondly jealous of husbands sold their\r\nwives. The tyranny of Mr. Hastings extinguished every sentiment of\r\nfather, son, brother, and husband!\r\n\r\nI come now to the last stage of their miseries. Everything visible and\r\nvendible was seized and sold. Nothing but the bodies remained.\r\n\r\nIt is the nature of tyranny and rapacity never to learn moderation from\r\nthe ill-success of first oppressions; on the contrary, all oppressors,\r\nall men thinking highly of the methods dictated by their nature,\r\nattribute the frustration of their desires to the want of sufficient\r\nrigor. Then they redouble the efforts of their impotent cruelty, which\r\nproducing, as they must ever produce, new disappointments, they grow\r\nirritated against the objects of their rapacity; and then rage, fury,\r\nand malice, implacable because unprovoked, recruiting and reinforcing\r\ntheir avarice, their vices are no longer human. From cruel men they are\r\ntransformed into savage beasts, with no other vestiges of reason left\r\nbut what serves to furnish the inventions and refinements of ferocious\r\nsubtlety, for purposes of which beasts are incapable and at which fiends\r\nwould blush.\r\n\r\nDebi Sing and his instruments suspected, and in a few cases they\r\nsuspected justly, that the country people had purloined from their own\r\nestates, and had hidden in secret places in the circumjacent deserts,\r\nsome small reserve of their own grain to maintain themselves during the\r\nunproductive months of the year, and to leave some hope for a future\r\nseason. But the under-tyrants knew that the demands of Mr. Hastings\r\nwould admit no plea for delay, much less for subtraction of his bribe,\r\nand that he would not abate a shilling of it to the wants of the whole\r\nhuman race. These hoards, real or supposed, not being discovered by\r\nmenaces and imprisonment, they fell upon the last resource, the naked\r\nbodies of the people. And here, my Lords, began such a scene of\r\ncruelties and tortures as I believe no history has ever presented to the\r\nindignation of the world,--such as I am sure, in the most barbarous\r\nages, no politic tyranny, no fanatic persecution, has ever yet exceeded.\r\nMr. Paterson, the commissioner appointed to inquire into the state of\r\nthe country, makes his own apology and mine for opening this scene of\r\nhorrors to you in the following words: \"That the punishments inflicted\r\nupon the ryots, both of Rungpore and Dinagepore, for non-payment, were\r\nin many instances of such a nature that I would rather wish to draw a\r\nveil over them than shock your feelings by the detail, but that, however\r\ndisagreeable the task may be to myself, it is absolutely necessary, for\r\nthe sake of justice, humanity, and the honor of government, that they\r\nshould be exposed, to be prevented in future.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, they began by winding cords round the fingers of the unhappy\r\nfreeholders of those provinces, until they clung to and were almost\r\nincorporated with one another; and then they hammered wedges of iron\r\nbetween them, until, regardless of the cries of the sufferers, they had\r\nbruised to pieces and forever crippled those poor, honest, innocent,\r\nlaborious hands, which had never been raised to their mouths but with a\r\npenurious and scanty proportion of the fruits of their own soil; but\r\nthose fruits (denied to the wants of their own children) have for more\r\nthan fifteen years past furnished the investment for our trade with\r\nChina, and been sent annually out, and without recompense, to purchase\r\nfor us that delicate meal with which your Lordships, and all this\r\nauditory, and all this country, have begun every day for these fifteen\r\nyears at their expense. To those beneficent hands that labor for our\r\nbenefit the return of the British government has been cords and hammers\r\nand wedges. But there is a place where these crippled and disabled hands\r\nwill act with resistless power. What is it that they will not pull down,\r\nwhen they are lifted to heaven against their oppressors? Then what can\r\nwithstand such hands? Can the power that crushed and destroyed them?\r\nPowerful in prayer, let us at least deprecate and thus endeavor to\r\nsecure ourselves from the vengeance which these mashed and disabled\r\nhands may pull down upon us. My Lords, it is an awful consideration: let\r\nus think of it.\r\n\r\nBut to pursue this melancholy, but necessary detail. I am next to open\r\nto your Lordships, what I am hereafter to prove, that the most\r\nsubstantial and leading yeomen, the responsible farmers, the parochial\r\nmagistrates and chiefs of villages, were tied two and two by the legs\r\ntogether; and their tormentors, throwing them with their heads\r\ndownwards, over a bar, beat them on the soles of the feet with rattans,\r\nuntil the nails fell from the toes; and then attacking them at their\r\nheads, as they hung downward, as before at their feet, they beat them\r\nwith sticks and other instruments of blind fury, until the blood gushed\r\nout at their eyes, mouths, and noses. Not thinking that the ordinary\r\nwhips and cudgels, even so administered, were sufficient, to others (and\r\noften also to the same who had suffered as I have stated) they applied,\r\ninstead of rattan and bamboo, whips made of the branches of the bale\r\ntree,--a tree full of sharp and strong thorns, which tear the skin and\r\nlacerate the flesh far worse than ordinary scourges. For others,\r\nexploring with a searching and inquisitive malice, stimulated by an\r\ninsatiate rapacity, all the devious paths of Nature for whatever is most\r\nunfriendly to man, they made rods of a plant highly caustic and\r\npoisonous, called _Bechettea_, every wound of which festers and\r\ngangrenes, adds double and treble to the present torture, leaves a crust\r\nof leprous sores upon the body, and often ends in the destruction of\r\nlife itself. At night, these poor innocent sufferers, these martyrs of\r\navarice and extortion, were brought into dungeons; and in the season\r\nwhen nature takes refuge in insensibility from all the miseries and\r\ncares which wait on life, they were three times scourged, and made to\r\nreckon the watches of the night by periods and intervals of torment.\r\nThey were then led out, in the severe depth of winter, which there at\r\ncertain seasons would be severe to any, to the Indians is most severe\r\nand almost intolerable,--they were led out before break of day, and,\r\nstiff and sore as they were with the bruises and wounds of the night,\r\nwere plunged into water; and whilst their jaws clung together with the\r\ncold, and their bodies were rendered infinitely more sensible, the blows\r\nand stripes were renewed upon their backs; and then, delivering them\r\nover to soldiers, they were sent into their farms and villages to\r\ndiscover where a few handfuls of grain might be found concealed, or to\r\nextract some loan from the remnants of compassion and courage not\r\nsubdued in those who had reason to fear that their own turn of torment\r\nwould be next, that they should succeed them in the same punishment, and\r\nthat their very humanity, being taken as a proof of their wealth, would\r\nsubject them (as it did in many cases subject them) to the same inhuman\r\ntortures. After this circuit of the day through their plundered and\r\nruined villages, they were remanded at night to the same prison,\r\nwhipped, as before, at their return to the dungeon, and at morning\r\nwhipped at their leaving it, and then sent, as before, to purchase, by\r\nbegging in the day, the reiteration of the torture in the night. Days of\r\nmenace, insult, and extortion, nights of bolts, fetters, and\r\nflagellation, succeeded to each other in the same round, and for a long\r\ntime made up all the vicissitude of life to these miserable people.\r\n\r\nBut there are persons whose fortitude could bear their own suffering;\r\nthere are men who are hardened by their very pains, and the mind,\r\nstrengthened even by the torments of the body, rises with a strong\r\ndefiance against its oppressor. They were assaulted on the side of their\r\nsympathy. Children were scourged almost to death in the presence of\r\ntheir parents. This was not enough. The son and father were bound close\r\ntogether, face to face and body to body, and in that situation cruelly\r\nlashed together, so that the blow which escaped the father fell upon the\r\nson, and the blow which missed the son wound over the back of the\r\nparent. The circumstances were combined by so subtle a cruelty that\r\nevery stroke which did not excruciate the sense should wound and\r\nlacerate the sentiments and affections of nature.\r\n\r\nOn the same principle, and for the same ends, virgins, who had never\r\nseen the sun, were dragged from the inmost sanctuaries of their houses,\r\nand in the open court of justice, in the very place where security was\r\nto be sought against all wrong and all violence, (but where no judge or\r\nlawful magistrate had long sat, but in their place the ruffians and\r\nhangmen of Warren Hastings occupied the bench,) these virgins, vainly\r\ninvoking heaven and earth, in the presence of their parents, and whilst\r\ntheir shrieks were mingled with the indignant cries and groans of all\r\nthe people, publicly were violated by the lowest and wickedest of the\r\nhuman race. Wives were torn from the arms of their husbands, and\r\nsuffered the same flagitious wrongs, which were indeed hid in the\r\nbottoms of the dungeons in which their honor and their liberty were\r\nburied together. Often they were taken out of the refuge of this\r\nconsoling gloom, stripped naked, and thus exposed to the world, and then\r\ncruelly scourged; and in order that cruelty might riot in all the\r\ncircumstances that melt into tenderness the fiercest natures, the\r\nnipples of their breasts were put between the sharp and elastic sides of\r\ncleft bamboos. Here in my hand is my authority; for otherwise one would\r\nthink it incredible. But it did not end there. Growing from crime to\r\ncrime, ripened by cruelty for cruelty, these fiends, at length outraging\r\nsex, decency, nature, applied lighted torches and slow fire--(I cannot\r\nproceed for shame and horror!)--these infernal furies planted death in\r\nthe source of life, and where that modesty, which, more than reason,\r\ndistinguishes men from beasts, retires from the view, and even shrinks\r\nfrom the expression, there they exercised and glutted their unnatural,\r\nmonstrous, and nefarious cruelty,--there, where the reverence of nature\r\nand the sanctity of justice dares not to pursue, nor venture to describe\r\ntheir practices.\r\n\r\nThese, my Lords, were sufferings which we feel all in common, in India\r\nand in England, by the general sympathy of our common nature. But there\r\nwere in that province (sold to the tormentors by Mr. Hastings) things\r\ndone, which, from the peculiar manners of India, were even worse than\r\nall I have laid before you; as the dominion of manners and the law of\r\nopinion contribute more to their happiness and misery than anything in\r\nmere sensitive nature can do.\r\n\r\nThe women thus treated lost their caste. My Lords, we are not here to\r\ncommend or blame the institutions and prejudices of a whole race of\r\npeople, radicated in them by a long succession of ages, on which no\r\nreason or argument, on which no vicissitudes of things, no mixtures of\r\nmen, or foreign conquest, have been able to make the smallest\r\nimpression. The aboriginal Gentoo inhabitants are all dispersed into\r\ntribes or castes,--each caste born to an invariable rank, rights, and\r\ndescriptions of employment, so that one caste cannot by any means pass\r\ninto another. With the Gentoos, certain impurities or disgraces, though\r\nwithout any guilt of the party, infer loss of caste; and when the\r\nhighest caste, that of Brahmin, which is not only noble, but sacred, is\r\nlost, the person who loses it does not slide down into one lower, but\r\nreputable,--he is wholly driven from all honest society. All the\r\nrelations of life are at once dissolved. His parents are no longer his\r\nparents; his wife is no longer his wife; his children, no longer his,\r\nare no longer to regard him as their father. It is something far worse\r\nthan complete outlawry, complete attainder, and universal\r\nexcommunication. It is a pollution even to touch him; and if he touches\r\nany of his old caste, they are justified in putting him to death.\r\nContagion, leprosy, plague, are not so much shunned. No honest\r\noccupation can be followed. He becomes an _halicore_, if (which is rare)\r\nhe survives that miserable degradation.\r\n\r\nUpon those whom all the shocking catalogue of tortures I have mentioned\r\ncould not make to flinch one of the modes of losing caste for Brahmins\r\nand other principal tribes was practised. It was to harness a bullock at\r\nthe court-door, and to put the Brahmin on his back, and to lead him\r\nthrough the towns, with drums beating before him. To intimidate others,\r\nthis bullock, with drums, (the instrument, according to their ideas, of\r\noutrage, disgrace, and utter loss of caste,) was led through the\r\ncountry; and as it advanced, the country fled before it. When any\r\nBrahmin was seized, he was threatened with this pillory, and for the\r\nmost part he submitted in a moment to whatever was ordered. What it was\r\nmay be thence judged. But when no possibility existed of complying with\r\nthe demand, the people by their cries sometimes prevailed on the tyrants\r\nto have it commuted for cruel scourging, which was accepted as mercy. To\r\nsome Brahmins this mercy was denied, and the act of indelible infamy\r\nexecuted. Of these men one came to the Company's commissioner with the\r\ntale, and ended with these melancholy words: \"I have suffered this\r\nindignity; my caste is lost; my life is a burden to me: I call for\r\njustice.\" He called in vain.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will not wonder that these monstrous and oppressive\r\ndemands, exacted with such tortures, threw the whole province into\r\ndespair. They abandoned their crops on the ground. The people, in a\r\nbody, would have fled out of its confines; but bands of soldiers\r\ninvested the avenues of the province, and, making a line of\r\ncircumvallation, drove back those wretches, who sought exile as a\r\nrelief, into the prison of their native soil. Not suffered to quit the\r\ndistrict, they fled to the many wild thickets which oppression had\r\nscattered through it, and sought amongst the jungles, and dens of\r\ntigers, a refuge from the tyranny of Warren Hastings. Not able long to\r\nexist here, pressed at once by wild beasts and famine, the same despair\r\ndrove them back; and seeking their last resource in arms, the most\r\nquiet, the most passive, the most timid of the human race rose up in an\r\nuniversal insurrection; and, what will always happen in popular tumults,\r\nthe effects of the fury of the people fell on the meaner and sometimes\r\nthe reluctant instruments of the tyranny, who in several places were\r\nmassacred. The insurrection began in Rungpore, and soon spread its fire\r\nto the neighboring provinces, which had been harassed by the same person\r\nwith the same oppressions. The English Chief in that province had been\r\nthe silent witness, most probably the abettor and accomplice, of all\r\nthese horrors. He called in first irregular, and then regular troops,\r\nwho by dreadful and universal military execution got the better of the\r\nimpotent resistance of unarmed and undisciplined despair. I am tired\r\nwith the detail of the cruelties of peace. I spare you those of a cruel\r\nand inhuman war, and of the executions which, without law or process, or\r\neven the shadow of authority, were ordered by the English Revenue Chief\r\nin that province.\r\n\r\nIn our Indian government, whatever grievance is borne is denied to\r\nexist, and all mute despair and sullen patience is construed into\r\ncontent and satisfaction. But this general insurrection, which at every\r\nmoment threatened to blaze out afresh, and to involve all the provinces\r\nin its flames, rent in pieces that veil of fraud and mystery that covers\r\nall the miseries of all the provinces. Calcutta rung with it; and it was\r\nfeared it would go to England. The English Chief in the province, Mr.\r\nGoodlad, represented it to Mr. Hastings's Revenue Committee to be (what\r\nit was) the greatest and most serious disturbance that ever happened in\r\nBengal. But, good easy man, he was utterly unable to guess to what cause\r\nit was to be attributed. He thought there was some irregularity in the\r\ncollection, but on the whole judged that it had little other cause than\r\na general conspiracy of the husbandmen and landholders, who, as Debi\r\nSing's lease was near expiring, had determined not to pay any more\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings's Committee of Revenue, whilst these wounds were yet\r\nbleeding, and whilst a total failure was threatened in the rents of\r\nthese provinces, thought themselves obliged to make an inquiry with some\r\nsort of appearance of seriousness into the causes of it. They looked,\r\ntherefore, about them carefully, and chose what they judged would be\r\nmost plausible and least effective. They thought that it was necessary\r\nto send a special commissioner into the province, and one, too, whose\r\ncharacter would not instantly blast the credit of his mission. They cast\r\ntheir eyes on a Mr. Paterson, a servant of the Company, a man of fair\r\ncharacter, and long standing in the service. Mr. Paterson was a person\r\nknown to be of a very cool temper, placid manners, moderate and middle\r\nopinions, unconnected with parties; and from such a character they\r\nlooked for (what sometimes is to be expected from it) a compromising,\r\nbalanced, neutralized, equivocal, colorless, confused report, in which\r\nthe blame was to be impartially divided between the sufferer and the\r\noppressor, and in which, according to the standing manners of Bengal, he\r\nwould recommend oblivion as the best remedy, and would end by remarking,\r\nthat retrospect could have no advantage, and could serve only to\r\nirritate and keep alive animosities; and by this kind of equitable,\r\ncandid, and judge-like proceeding, they hoped the whole complaint would\r\ncalmly fade away, the sufferers remain in the possession of their\r\npatience, and the tyrant of his plunder. In confidence of this event\r\nfrom this presumed character, Mr. Hastings's Committee, in appointing\r\nMr. Paterson their commissioner, were not deficient in arming him with\r\npowers equal to the object of his commission. He was enabled to call\r\nbefore him all accountants, to compel the production of all accounts, to\r\nexamine all persons,--not only to inquire and to report, but to decide\r\nand to redress.\r\n\r\nSuch is the imperfection of human wisdom that the Committee totally\r\nfailed in their well-laid project. They were totally mistaken in their\r\nman. Under that cold outside the commissioner, Paterson, concealed a\r\nfirm, manly, and fixed principle, a deciding intellect, and a feeling\r\nheart. My Lords, he is the son of a gentleman of a venerable age and\r\nexcellent character in this country, who long filled the seat of\r\nchairman of the Committee of Supply in the House of Commons, and who is\r\nnow enjoying repose from his long labors in an honorable age. The son,\r\nas soon as he was appointed to this commission, was awed by and dreaded\r\nthe consequences. He knew to what temptation he should be exposed, from\r\nthe known character of Debi Sing, to suppress or to misrepresent facts.\r\nHe therefore took out a letter he had from his father, which letter was\r\nthe preservation of his character and destruction of his fortune. This\r\nletter he always resorted to in all trying exigencies of his life. He\r\nlaid the letter before him, and there was enjoined such a line of\r\nintegrity, incorruptness, of bearing every degree of persecution rather\r\nthan disguising truth, that he went up into the country in a proper\r\nframe of mind for doing his duty.\r\n\r\nHe went to Rungpore strongly impressed with a sense of the great trust\r\nthat was placed in him; and he had not the least reason to doubt of full\r\nsupport in the execution of it,--as he, with every other white man in\r\nBengal, probably, and every black, except two, was ignorant of the fact,\r\nthat the Governor-General, under whose delegated authority he was sent,\r\nhad been bribed by the farmer-general of those provinces, and had sold\r\nthem to his discretion for a great sum of money. If Paterson had known\r\nthis fact, no human consideration would have induced him, or any other\r\nman of common prudence, to undertake an inquiry into the conduct of Debi\r\nSing. Pity, my Lords, the condition of an honest servant in Bengal.\r\n\r\nBut Paterson was ignorant of this dark transaction, and went simply to\r\nperform a duty. He had hardly set his foot in the province, when the\r\nuniversal, unquestioned, uncontradicted testimony of the whole people,\r\nconcurring with the manifest evidence of things which could not lie,\r\nwith the face of an utterly ruined, undone, depopulated country, and\r\nsaved from literal and exceptionless depopulation only by the\r\nexhibition of scattered bands of wild, naked, meagre, half-famished\r\nwretches, who rent heaven with their cries and howlings, left him no\r\nsort of doubt of the real cause of the late tumults. In his first\r\nletters he conveyed his sentiments to the Committee with these memorable\r\nwords. \"In my two reports I have set forth in a general manner the\r\noppressions which provoked the ryots to rise. I shall, therefore, not\r\nenumerate them now. Every day of my inquiry serves but to confirm the\r\nfacts. The wonder would have been, if they had not risen. It was not\r\ncollection, but real robbery, aggravated by corporal punishment and\r\nevery insult of disgrace,--and this not confined to a few, but extended\r\nover every individual. Let the mind of man be ever so much inured to\r\nservitude, still there is a point where oppressions will rouse it to\r\nresistance. Conceive to yourselves what must be the situation of a ryot,\r\nwhen he sees everything he has in the world seized, to answer an\r\nexaggerated demand, and sold at so low a price as not to answer one half\r\nof that demand,--when he finds himself so far from being released, that\r\nhe remains still subject to corporal punishment. But what must be his\r\nfeelings, when his tyrant, seeing that kind of severity of no avail,\r\nadds family disgrace and loss of caste! You, Gentlemen, who know the\r\nreserve of the natives in whatever concerns their women, and their\r\nattachment to their castes, must allow the full effect of these\r\nprejudices under such circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nHe, however, proceeded with steadiness and method, and in spite of every\r\ndiscouragement which could be thrown in his way by the power, craft,\r\nfraud, and corruption of the farmer-general, Debi Sing, by the collusion\r\nof the Provincial Chief, and by the decay of support from his\r\nemployers, which gradually faded away and forsook him, as his occasions\r\nfor it increased. Under all these, and under many more discouragements\r\nand difficulties, he made a series of able, clear, and well-digested\r\nreports, attended with such evidence as never before, and, I believe,\r\nnever will again appear, of the internal provincial administration of\r\nBengal,--of evils universally understood, which no one was ever so\r\nabsurd as to contradict, and whose existence was never denied, except in\r\nthose places where they ought to be rectified, although none before\r\nPaterson had the courage to display the particulars. By these reports,\r\ncarefully collated with the evidence, I have been enabled to lay before\r\nyou some of the effects, in one province and part of another, of\r\nGovernor Hastings's general system of bribery.\r\n\r\nBut now appeared, in the most striking light, the good policy of Mr.\r\nHastings's system of 1780, in placing this screen of a Committee between\r\nhim and his crimes. The Committee had their lesson. Whilst Paterson is\r\nleft collecting his evidence and casting up his accounts in Rungpore,\r\nDebi Sing is called up, in seeming wrath, to the capital, where he is\r\nreceived as those who have robbed and desolated provinces, and filled\r\ntheir coffers with seven hundred thousand pounds sterling, have been\r\nusually received at Calcutta, and sometimes in Great Britain. Debi Sing\r\nmade good his ground in Calcutta, and when he had well prepared his\r\nCommittee, in due time Paterson returns, appears, and reports.\r\n\r\nPersons even less informed than your Lordships are well apprised that\r\nall officers representing government, and making in that character an\r\nauthorized inquiry, are entitled to a presumptive credit for all their\r\nproceedings, and that their reports of facts (where there is no evidence\r\nof corruption or malice) are in the first instance to be taken for\r\ntruth, especially by those who have authorized the inquiry; and it is\r\ntheir duty to put the burden of proof to the contrary on those who would\r\nimpeach or shake the report.\r\n\r\nOther principles of policy, and other rules of government, and other\r\nmaxims of office prevailed in the Committee of Mr. Hastings's devising.\r\nIn order to destroy that just and natural credit of the officer, and the\r\nprotection and support they were bound to afford him, they in an instant\r\nshift and reverse all the relations in which the parties stood.\r\n\r\nThis executive board, instituted for the protection of the revenue and\r\nof the people, and which was no court of justice in fact or name, turned\r\ntheir own representative officer, reporting facts according to his duty,\r\ninto a voluntary accuser who is to make good his charge at his peril;\r\nthe farmer-general, whose conduct was not criminally attacked, but\r\nappeared as one of the grounds of a public inquiry, is turned into a\r\nculprit before a court of justice, against whom everything is to be\r\njuridically made out or not admitted; and the members of an executive\r\nboard, by usurpation and fraud, erect themselves into judges bound to\r\nproceed by strict rules of law.\r\n\r\nBy this infamous juggle they took away, as far as in them lay, the\r\ncredit due to the proceedings of government. They changed the natural\r\nsituation of proofs. They rejected the depositions of Paterson's\r\nwitnesses, as not on oath, though they had never ordered or authorized\r\nthem so to be taken.\r\n\r\nThey went further, and disabled, in a body, all the deponents\r\nthemselves, whether on oath or not on oath by discrediting the whole\r\nprovince as a set of criminals who gave evidence to palliate their own\r\nrebellion. They administered interrogatories to the commissioner instead\r\nof the culprit. They took a base fellow, whom they had themselves\r\nordered their commissioner to imprison for crimes, (crimes charged on\r\nhim, not by the commissioner, but by themselves,) and made him a\r\ncomplainant and a witness against him in the stupidest and most\r\nimprobable of all accusations,--namely, that Paterson had menaced him\r\nwith punishment, if he did not, in so many words, slander and calumniate\r\nDebi Sing; and then the Committee, seating this wretch as an assessor at\r\ntheir own board, who a few days before would have trembled like a\r\nwhipped slave at the look of an European, encouraged him to interrogate\r\ntheir own commissioner.\r\n\r\n[_Here Mr. Burke was taken ill, and obliged to sit down. After some time\r\nMr. Burke again addressed the House._]\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I am sorry to break the attention of your Lordships in such a\r\nway. It is a subject that agitates me. It is long, difficult, and\r\narduous; but with the blessing of God, if I can, to save you any further\r\ntrouble, I will go through it this day.\r\n\r\nI am to tell your Lordships, that the next step they took was, after\r\nputting Mr. Paterson as an accuser to make good a charge which he made\r\nout but too much to their satisfaction, they changed their battery.\r\n\r\n[_Mr. Burke's illness increased; upon which the House, on the motion of\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, adjourned._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nOPENING THE IMPEACHMENT.\r\n\r\nFOURTH DAY: TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--In any great undertaking, a failure in the midst of it, even\r\nfrom infirmity, though to be regarded principally as a misfortune, is\r\nattended with some slight shadow of disgrace; but your Lordships'\r\nhumanity, and your love of justice, have remedied everything, and I\r\ntherefore proceed with confidence this day.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I think (to the best of my remembrance) the House adjourned at\r\nthe period of time in which I was endeavoring to illustrate the\r\nmischiefs that happened from Mr. Hastings's throwing off his\r\nresponsibility, by delegating his power to a nominal Council, and in\r\nreality to a black bad man, a native of the country, of the worst\r\ncharacter that could be found in it,--and the consequence of it, in\r\npreventing the detection and the punishment of the grossest abuses that\r\never were known to be committed in India, or any other part of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I stated to you that Mr. Commissioner Paterson was sent into\r\nthat country. I stated that he was sent into it with all the authority\r\nof government, with power to hear, and not only to hear and to report,\r\nbut to redress, the grievances which he should find in the country. In\r\nshort, there was nothing wanting to his power but an honest support.\r\nYour Lordships will be convinced that the road to fortune was easy to\r\nhim. Debi Sing for a favorable report would have given a large sum of\r\nmoney. Your Lordships will be convinced that the Committee would not\r\nhave received such a report as a proof of bribery. They would rather\r\nconsider him as a man whose conduct tended to conciliate, and to soften\r\ntroublesome and difficult matters, and to settle the order of government\r\nas soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSome of the things contained in his reports I have taken the liberty of\r\nlaying before your Lordships, but very faintly, very imperfectly, and\r\nfar short of my materials. I have stated, that the criminal, against\r\nwhom the commissioner had made his report, instead of being punished by\r\nthat strong hand of power which Mr. Hastings has thought proper to use\r\nupon other occasions, when he has endeavored to make princes, or persons\r\nin the rank and with the attributes of sovereign princes, feel whenever\r\nthey have incurred his private resentments,--that this man was put into\r\nevery situation of offence or defence which the most litigious and\r\nprevaricating laws that ever were invented in the very bosom of\r\narbitrary power could afford him, or by which peculation and power were\r\nto be screened from the cries of an oppressed people.\r\n\r\nMr. Paterson, I stated, from being a commissioner directed to report,\r\nunder the authority of government, to that government, was considered as\r\na voluntary accuser, obliged to make good the articles of his charge.\r\nBut I believe I stated that he did not long remain in that condition.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to state to your Lordships, that this Debi Sing,\r\nfortified by this protection, which was extended even to the lowest of\r\nhis instruments, thought it high time to assume the superiority that\r\nbelonged to a personage who had the Governor-General for his\r\n_pensioner_. No longer the sneaking tone of apology; no longer the\r\nmodest allegations that the commissioner was misinformed;--he boldly\r\naccuses the representative of English government of forgery in order to\r\ndestroy him; he criminates and recriminates, and lays about him without\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nThings were now in a proper train; the Committee find the cause growing\r\nand ripening to their wishes;--answers, replies, objections, and\r\ninterrogatories,--accounts opposed to accounts,--balances now on the one\r\nside, now on the other,--now debtor becomes creditor, and creditor\r\ndebtor,--until the proceedings were grown to the size of volumes, and\r\nthe whole well fitted to perplex the most simple facts, and to darken\r\nthe meridian sunshine of public notoriety. They prepared a report for\r\nthe Governor-General and Council suitable to the whole tenor of their\r\nproceedings. Here the man whom they had employed and betrayed appeared\r\nin a new character. Observe their course with him. First he was made a\r\ncommissioner. Then he was changed from a commissioner to be a voluntary\r\naccuser. He now undergoes another metamorphosis: he appears as a culprit\r\nbefore Mr. Hastings, on the accusation of the donor of Mr. Hastings's\r\nbribes. He is to answer to the accusations of Debi Sing. He is permitted\r\nto find materials for his own defence; and he, an old Company's servant,\r\nis to acknowledge it as a favor to be again suffered to go into the\r\nprovince, without authority, without station, without public character,\r\nunder the discountenance and frowns, and in a manner under prosecution,\r\nof the government. As a favor, he is suffered to go again into Rungpore,\r\nin hopes of finding among the dejected, harassed, and enslaved race of\r\nHindoos, and in that undone province, men bold enough to stand forward,\r\nagainst all temptations of emolument, and at the risk of their lives,\r\nwith a firm adherence to their original charge,--and at a time when they\r\nsaw _him_ an abandoned and persecuted private individual, whom they had\r\njust before looked upon as a protecting angel, carrying with him the\r\nwhole power of a beneficent government, and whom they had applied to, as\r\na magistrate of high and sacred authority, to hear the complaints and to\r\nredress the grievances of a whole people.\r\n\r\nA new commission of junior servants was at the same time sent out to\r\nreview and reëxamine the cause, to inquire into the inquiry, to examine\r\ninto the examination, to control the report, to be commissioners upon\r\nthe commission of Mr. Paterson. Before these commissioners he was made\r\nto appear as an accused person, and was put upon his defence, but\r\nwithout the authority and without the favor which ought to go with an\r\naccused person for the purpose of enabling him to make out such defence.\r\n\r\nThese persons went down into that country, and, after spending a long\r\ntime in mere matters of form, found they could not do without a\r\nrepresentative of Debi Sing, and accordingly they ordered Debi Sing to\r\nsend up his _vakeel_.\r\n\r\nI forgot to state to your Lordships what the condition of Debi Sing was\r\nduring this proceeding. This man had been ordered to Calcutta on two\r\ngrounds: one, on the matter of his flagitious misconduct at Rungpore;\r\nand the other, for a great failure in the payment of his stipulated\r\nrevenue. Under this double accusation, he was to be considered,\r\naccording to the usual mode of proceeding in such cases, as a prisoner;\r\nand he was kept, not in the common gaol of Calcutta, not in the prison\r\nof the fort, not in that gaol in which Rajah Nundcomar, who had been\r\nprime-minister of the empire, was confined, but, according to the mild\r\nways of that country, where they choose to be mild, and the persons are\r\nprotected by the official influence of power, under a free custody. He\r\nwas put under a guard of sepoys, but not confined to his house; he was\r\npermitted to go abroad, where he was daily in conference with those who\r\nwere to judge him; and having an address which seldom fails, and a\r\ndexterity never wanting to a man possessed of 700,000_l._, he converted\r\nthis guard into a retinue of honor: their bayonets were lowered, their\r\nmuskets laid aside; they attended him with their side-arms, and many\r\nwith silver verges in their hands, to mark him out rather as a great\r\nmagistrate attended by a retinue than a prisoner under guard.\r\n\r\nWhen he was ordered to send a vakeel to defend his conduct, he refused\r\nto send him. Upon which the commissioners, instead of saying, \"If you\r\nwill not send your agent, we will proceed in our inquiry without him,\"\r\n(and, indeed, it was not made necessary by the commission that he should\r\nbe there either by vakeel or otherwise,) condescendingly admitted his\r\nrefusal, and suffered him to come up in person. He accordingly enters\r\nthe province, attended with his guard, in the manner I have before\r\nmentioned, more as a person returning in triumph from a great victory\r\nthan as a man under the load of all those enormous charges which I have\r\nstated. He enters the province in this manner; and Mr. Paterson, who saw\r\nhimself lately the representative of the India Company, (an old servant\r\nof the Company is a great man in that country,) was now left naked,\r\ndestitute, without any mark of official situation or dignity. He was\r\npresent, and saw all the marks of imprisonment turned into marks of\r\nrespect and dignity to this consummate villain whom I have the\r\nmisfortune of being obliged to introduce to your Lordships' notice. Mr.\r\nPaterson, seeing the effect of the proceeding everywhere, seeing the\r\nminds of the people broken, subdued, and prostrate under it, and that,\r\nso far from having the means of detecting the villanies of this insolent\r\ncriminal, appearing as a magistrate, he had not the means of defending\r\neven his own innocence, because every kind of information fled and was\r\nannihilated before him, represented to these young commissioners that\r\nthis appearance of authority tended to strike terror into the hearts of\r\nthe natives, and to prevent his receiving justice. The Council of\r\nCalcutta took this representation into their deliberate consideration;\r\nthey found that it was true, that, if he had such an attendance any\r\nlonger in this situation, (and a large attendance it was, such as the\r\nChancellor of this kingdom or the Speaker of the House of Commons does\r\nnot appear with,) it would have an evil appearance. On the other hand,\r\nsay they, \"_If he should be left under a guard, the people would\r\nconsider him as under disgrace._\" They therefore took a middle way, and\r\nordered the guard not to attend him with fixed bayonets, which had the\r\nappearance of the custody of a prisoner, but to lower their muskets and\r\nunfix their bayonets.\r\n\r\nThe next step of these commissioners is to exclude Mr. Paterson from all\r\ntheir deliberations; and in order that both parties might be put on an\r\nequality, one would naturally conclude that the culprit, Debi Sing, was\r\nlikewise excluded. Far from it: he sat upon the bench. Need I say any\r\nmore upon this subject? The protection followed.\r\n\r\nIn this situation Mr. Paterson wrote one of the most pathetic memorials\r\nthat ever was penned to the Council of Calcutta, submitting to his hard\r\nfate, but standing inflexibly to his virtue that brought it upon him. To\r\ndo the man justice, he bore the whole of this persecution like an hero.\r\nHe never tottered in his principles, nor swerved to the right or to the\r\nleft from the noble cause of justice and humanity in which he had been\r\nengaged; and when your Lordships come to see his memorials, you will\r\nhave reason to observe that his abilities are answerable to the dignity\r\nof his cause, and make him worthy of everything that he had the honor to\r\nsuffer for it.\r\n\r\nTo cut short the thread of this shocking series of corruption,\r\noppression, fraud, and chicanery, which lasted for upwards of four\r\nyears: Paterson remains without employment; the inhabitants of great\r\nprovinces, whose substance and whose blood was sold by Mr. Hastings,\r\nremain without redress; and the purchaser, Debi Sing, that corrupt,\r\niniquitous, and bloody tyrant, instead of being proceeded against by the\r\nCommittee in a civil suit for retribution to the sufferers, is handed\r\nover to the false semblance of a trial, on a criminal charge, before a\r\nMahometan judge,--an equal judge, however. The judge was Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân, his original patron, and the author of all his fortunes,--a judge\r\nwho depends on him, as a debtor depends upon his creditor. To that\r\njudge is he sent, without a distinct charge, without a prosecutor, and\r\nwithout evidence. The next ships will bring you an account of his\r\nhonorable acquittal.\r\n\r\nI have stated before that I considered Mr. Hastings as responsible for\r\nthe characters of the people he employed,--doubly responsible, if he\r\n_knew_ them to be bad. I therefore charge him with putting in situations\r\nin which any evil may be committed persons of known evil characters.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I charge him, as chief governor, with destroying the\r\ninstitutions of the country, which were designed to be, and ought to\r\nhave been, controls upon such a person as Debi Sing.\r\n\r\nAn officer, called dewan, or steward of the country, had always been\r\nplaced as a control on the farmer; but that no such control should in\r\nfact exist, that he, Debi Sing, should be let loose to rapine,\r\nslaughter, and plunder in the country, both offices were conferred on\r\nhim. Did Mr. Hastings vest these offices in him? No: but if Mr. Hastings\r\nhad kept firm to the duties which the act of Parliament appointed him to\r\nexecute, all the revenue appointments must have been made by him; but,\r\ninstead of making them himself, he appointed Gunga Govind Sing to make\r\nthem; and for that appointment, and for the whole train of subordinate\r\nvillany which followed the placing iniquity in the chief seat of\r\ngovernment, Mr. Hastings is answerable. He is answerable, I say, first,\r\nfor destroying his own legal capacity, and, next, for destroying the\r\nlegal capacity of the Council, not one of whom ever had, or could have,\r\nany true knowledge of the state of the country, from the moment he\r\nburied it in the gulf of mystery and of darkness, under that collected\r\nheap of villany, Gunga Govind Sing. From that moment he destroyed the\r\npower of government, and put everything into his hands: for this he is\r\nanswerable.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Councils consisted of many members, who, though they\r\nmight unite in some small iniquities perhaps, could not possibly have\r\nconcealed from the public eye the commission of such acts as these.\r\nTheir very numbers, their natural competitions, the contentions that\r\nmust have arisen among them, must have put a check, at least, to such a\r\nbusiness. And therefore, Mr. Hastings having destroyed every check and\r\ncontrol above and below, having delivered the whole into the hands of\r\nGunga Govind Sing, for all the iniquities of Gunga Govind Sing he is\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nBut he did not know Debi Sing, whom he employed. I read, yesterday, and\r\ntrust it is fresh in your Lordships' remembrance, that Debi Sing was\r\npresented to him by that set of tools, as they call themselves, who\r\nacted, as they themselves tell us they must act, entirely and implicitly\r\nunder Gunga Govind Sing,--that is to say, by Gunga Govind Sing himself,\r\nthe confidential agent of Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings is further responsible, because he took a bribe of\r\n40,000_l._ from some person in power in Dinagepore and Rungpore, the\r\ncountries which were ravaged in this manner, through the hands of Gunga\r\nGovind Sing,--through the medium of that very person whom he had\r\nappointed to exercise all the authorities of the Supreme Council above\r\nand of all subordinate Councils below. Having, therefore, thus appointed\r\na Council of tools in the hands of Gunga Govind Sing, at the expense of\r\n62,000_l._ a year, to supersede all the English provincial\r\nauthorities,--having appointed them for the purpose of establishing a\r\nbribe-factor general, a general receiver and agent of bribes through all\r\nthat country, Mr. Hastings is responsible for all the consequences of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI have thought it necessary, and absolutely necessary it is, to state\r\nwhat the consequence of this clandestine mode of supplying the Company's\r\nexigencies was. Your Lordships will see that their exigencies are to be\r\nsupplied by the ruin of the landed interest of a province, the\r\ndestruction of the husbandmen, and the ruin of all the people in it.\r\nThis is the consequence of a general bribe-broker, an agent like Gunga\r\nGovind Sing, superseding all the powers and controls of government.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Hastings has not only reduced bribery to a system of government\r\npractically, but theoretically. For when he despaired any longer of\r\nconcealing his bribes from the penetrating eye of Parliament, then he\r\ntook another mode, and declared, as your Lordships will see, that it was\r\nthe best way of supplying the necessities of the East India Company in\r\nthe pressing exigencies of their affairs; that thus a relief to the\r\nCompany's affairs might be yielded, which, in the common, ostensible\r\nmode, and under the ordinary forms of government, and publicly, never\r\nwould be yielded to them. So that bribery with him became a supplement\r\nto exaction.\r\n\r\nThe best way of showing that a theoretical system is bad is to show the\r\npractical mischiefs that it produces: because a thing may look specious\r\nin theory, and yet be ruinous in practice; a thing may look evil in\r\ntheory, and yet be in its practice excellent. Here a thing in theory,\r\nstated by Mr. Hastings to be productive of much good, is in reality\r\nproductive of all those horrible mischiefs I have stated. That Mr.\r\nHastings well knew this appears from an extract of the Bengal Revenue\r\nConsultations, 21st January, 1785, a little before he came away.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings says,--\"I entirely acquit Mr. Goodlad of all the charges:\r\nhe has disproved them. It was the duty of the accuser to prove them.\r\nWhatever crimes may be established against Rajah Debi Sing, it does not\r\nfollow that Mr. Goodlad was responsible for them; and I so well know the\r\ncharacter and abilities of Rajah Debi Sing, that I can easily conceive\r\nthat it was in his power both to commit the enormities which are laid to\r\nhis charge, and to conceal the grounds of them from Mr. Goodlad, who had\r\nno authority but that of receiving the accounts and rents of the\r\ndistrict from Rajah Debi Sing, and occasionally to be the channel of\r\ncommunication between him and the Committee.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall now see what things Mr. Hastings did, what course he was in, a\r\nlittle before his departure,--with what propriety and consistency of\r\ncharacter he has behaved from the year of the commencement of his\r\ncorrupt system, in 1773, to the end of it, when he closed it in 1785,\r\nwhen the bribes not only mounted the chariot, but boarded the barge,\r\nand, as I shall show, followed him down the Ganges, and even to the sea,\r\nand that he never quitted his system of iniquity, but that it survived\r\nhis political life itself.\r\n\r\nOne of his last political acts was this.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will remember that Mr. Goodlad was sent up into the\r\ncountry, whose conduct was terrible indeed: for that he could not be in\r\nplace and authority in that country, and be innocent, while such things\r\nwere doing, I shall prove. But that is not now my consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General's minute, just read, is this. \"I entirely acquit\r\nMr. Goodlad of all the charges: he has disproved them. It was the duty\r\nof the accuser to prove them\" (the accuser, namely, the commissioner).\r\n\"Whatever crimes may be established against Rajah Debi Sing, it does not\r\nfollow that Mr. Goodlad was responsible for them; and I so well know the\r\ncharacter,\" &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\nNow your Lordships perceive he has acquitted Mr. Goodlad. He is clear.\r\nBe it that he is fairly and conscientiously acquitted. But what is Mr.\r\nHastings's account of Rajah Debi Sing? He is presented to him in 1781,\r\nby Gunga Govind Sing, as a person against whose character there could be\r\nno exception, and by him accepted in that light. Upon the occasion I\r\nhave mentioned, Mr. Hastings's opinion of him is this: \"I so well know\r\nthe character and abilities of Rajah Debi Sing, that I can easily\r\nconceive that it was in his power both to commit the enormities which\r\nare laid to his charge, and to conceal the grounds of them from Mr.\r\nGoodlad, who had no authority but that of receiving the accounts and\r\nrents of the district from Rajah Debi Sing, and occasionally to be the\r\nchannel of communication between him and the Committee.\"\r\n\r\nThus your Lordships see what Mr. Hastings's opinion of Debi Sing was. We\r\nshall prove it at another time, by abundance of clear and demonstrative\r\nevidence, that, whether he was bad or no, (but we shall prove that bad\r\nhe was indeed,) _even he_ could hardly be so bad as he was in the\r\nopinion which Mr. Hastings entertained of him; who, notwithstanding, now\r\ndisowns this mock Committee, instituted by himself, but, in reality,\r\nentirely managed by Gunga Govind Sing. This Debi Sing was accepted as an\r\nunexceptionable man; and yet Mr. Hastings knows both his power of doing\r\nmischief and his artifice in concealing it. If, then, Mr. Goodlad is to\r\nbe acquitted, does it not show the evil of Mr. Hastings's conduct in\r\ndestroying those Provincial Councils which, as I have already stated,\r\nwere obliged to book everything, to minute all the circumstances which\r\ncame before them, together with all the consultations respecting them?\r\nHe strikes at the whole system at once, and, instead of it, he leaves an\r\nEnglishman, under pretence of controlling Gunga Govind Sing's agent,\r\nappointed for the very purpose of giving him bribes, in a province where\r\nMr. Hastings says that agent had the power of committing such\r\nenormities, and which nobody doubts his disposition to commit,--he\r\nleaves him, I say, in such a state of inefficiency, that these\r\niniquities could be concealed (though every one true) from the person\r\nappointed there to inspect his conduct! What, then, could be his\r\nbusiness there? Was it only to receive such sums of money as Debi Sing\r\nmight put into his hands, and which might have been easily sent to\r\nCalcutta? Was he to be of use as a communication between Debi Sing and\r\nthe Committee, and in no other way? Here, then, we have that English\r\nauthority which Mr. Hastings left in the country,--here the native\r\nauthority which he settled, and the establishment of native iniquity in\r\na regular system under Gunga Govind Sing,--here the destruction of all\r\nEnglish inspection. I hope I need say no more to prove to your Lordships\r\nthat this system, taken nakedly as it thus stands, founded in mystery\r\nand obscurity, founded for the very express purpose of conveying\r\nbribes, as the best mode of collecting the revenue and supplying the\r\nCompany's exigencies through Gunga Govind Sing, would be iniquitous upon\r\nthe face and the statement of it. But when your Lordships consider what\r\nhorrid effects it produced, you will easily see what the mischief and\r\nabomination of Mr. Hastings's destroying these Provincial Councils and\r\nprotecting these persons must necessarily be. If you had not known in\r\ntheory, you must have seen it in practice.\r\n\r\nBut when both practice and theory concur, there can be no doubt that a\r\nsystem of private bribery for a revenue, and of private agency for a\r\nconstitutional government, must ruin the country where it prevails, must\r\ndisgrace the country that uses it, and finally end in the destruction of\r\nthe revenue. For what says Mr. Hastings? \"I was to have received\r\n40,000_l._ in bribes, and 30,000_l._ was actually applied to the use of\r\nthe Company.\" Now I hope I shall demonstrate, if not, it will be by some\r\none abler than me demonstrated, in the course of this business, that\r\nthere never was a bribe received by Mr. Hastings that was not instantly\r\nfollowed with a deficiency in the revenue,--this is clear, and what we\r\nundertake to prove,--and that Debi Sing himself was, at the time Mr.\r\nHastings came away, between twenty and thirty thousand pounds debtor to\r\nthe Company. So that, in truth, you always find a deficiency of revenue\r\nnearly equal, and in some instances I shall show double, to all the\r\nbribes Mr. Hastings received: from whence it will be evident that he\r\nnever could nor did receive them under that absurd and strange idea of a\r\nresource to government.\r\n\r\nI must re-state to your Lordships, because I wish you never to forget,\r\nthat this Committee of Revenue was, in their own opinion, and from their\r\nown certain knowledge and mere motion, if motion can be attributed\r\noriginally to instruments, mere tools; that they knew that they were\r\ntools in the hands of Gunga Govind Sing. There were two persons\r\nprincipal in it,--Mr. Shore, who was the acting President, and Mr.\r\nAnderson, who was President in rank, and President in emolument, but\r\nabsent for a great part of the time upon a foreign embassy. It is the\r\nrecorded opinion of the former, (for I must beg leave to read again a\r\npart of the paper which has already been read to your Lordships,) that\r\n\"the Committee, with the best intentions, best abilities, and steadiest\r\napplication, must, after all, be a tool in the hands of their dewan.\"\r\n\r\nNow do you believe, in the first place, that men will long have\r\nabilities, will long have good intentions, and will long, above all,\r\nhave steady application, when they know they are but tools in the hands\r\nof another,--when they know they are tools for his own corrupt purposes?\r\n\r\nIn the next place, I must beg leave to state to you, that, on the\r\nconstitution of this Committee, Mr. Hastings made them all take a solemn\r\noath that they would never receive any present whatever. It was not\r\nenough to trust to a general covenant; it was not enough to trust to the\r\npenal act of 1773: he bound the Committee by a new oath, and forced them\r\nto declare that they would not receive any bribes. As soon as he had so\r\nsecured them against receiving bribes, he was resolved to make them\r\ninefficient,--a good way to secure them against bribes, by taking from\r\nthem the power of bribe-worthy service. This was a good counter-security\r\nto their oath. But Mr. Hastings put a dewan there, against whom there\r\nwas no security; he let loose this dewan to frustrate their intentions,\r\ntheir application, their abilities, and oath: that is, there was a\r\nperson at that board who was more than the board itself, who might riot\r\nin peculation and plunder from one end of the country to the other. He\r\nwas there to receive bribes for Mr. Hastings; the Committee were to be\r\npure with impotent hands; and then came a person with ample power for\r\nMr. Hastings himself. And lest this person should not have power enough\r\nin this Committee, he is made the general bribe-broker to Mr. Hastings.\r\nThis secret under-current, as your Lordships will see, is to counteract\r\neverything, and, as fast as one part is rendered pure, totally to\r\ncorrupt all the rest.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, this was not the private opinion of Mr. Shore only, a man\r\nof great abilities, and intimately acquainted with the revenue, who must\r\nknow when he was in a situation to do good and when not. The other\r\ngentleman whom I have mentioned, Mr. Hastings's confidant in everything\r\nbut his bribes, and supposed to be in his closest secrets, is Mr.\r\nAnderson. I should remark to your Lordships, that Mr. Anderson is a man\r\napparently of weak nerves, of modest and very guarded demeanor, as we\r\nhave seen him in the House of Commons; it is in that way only I have the\r\nhonor of knowing him. Mr. Anderson being asked whether he agreed in the\r\nopinion and admitted the truth of his friend Mr. Shore's statement\r\nrelative to the dewan of the Committee, his answer was this: \"I do not\r\nthink that I should have written it quite so strong, but I do in a great\r\nmeasure agree to it: that is, I think there is a great deal of truth in\r\nthe observation; I think, in particular, that it would require great\r\nexertion in the Committee, and great abilities on the part of the\r\nPresident, to restrain effectually the conduct of the dewan; I think it\r\nwould be difficult for the Committee to interpose a sufficient control\r\nto guard against all the abuses of the dewan.\"\r\n\r\nThere is the real President of the Committee,--there the most active,\r\nefficient member of it. They are both of one opinion concerning their\r\nsituation: and I think this opinion of Mr. Anderson is still more\r\nstrong; for, as he thinks he should have written it with a little more\r\nguard, but should have agreed in substance, you must naturally think the\r\nstrongest expression the truest representation of the circumstance.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance that must strike your Lordships relative\r\nto this institution. It is where the President says that the use of the\r\nPresident would be to exert his best abilities, his greatest\r\napplication, his constant guard,--for what?--to prevent his dewan from\r\nbeing guilty of bribery and being guilty of oppressions. So here is an\r\nexecutive constitution in which the chief executive minister is to be in\r\nsuch a situation and of such a disposition that the chief employment of\r\nthe presiding person in the Committee is to guard against him and to\r\nprevent his doing mischief. Here is a man appointed, of the greatest\r\npossible power, of the greatest possible wickedness, in a situation to\r\nexert that power and wickedness for the destruction of the country, and\r\nwithout doubt it would require the greatest ability and diligence in the\r\nperson at the head of that Council to prevent it. Such a constitution,\r\nallowed and alleged by the persons themselves who composed it, was, I\r\nbelieve, never heard of in the world.\r\n\r\nNow that I have done with this part of the system of bribery, your\r\nLordships will permit me to follow Mr. Hastings to his last parting\r\nscene. He parted with his power, he parted with his situation, he parted\r\nwith everything, but he never could part with Gunga Govind Sing. He was\r\non his voyage, he had embarked, he was upon the Ganges, he had quitted\r\nhis government; and his last dying sigh, his last parting voice, was\r\n\"Gunga Govind Sing!\" It ran upon the banks of the Ganges, as another\r\nplaintive voice ran upon the banks of another river (I forget whose);\r\nhis last accents were, \"Gunga, Gunga Govind Sing!\" It demonstrates the\r\npower of friendship.\r\n\r\nIt is said by some idle, absurd moralists, that friendship is a thing\r\nthat cannot subsist between bad men; but I will show your Lordships the\r\ndirect contrary; and, after having shown you what Gunga Govind Sing was,\r\nI shall bring before you Mr. Hastings's last act of friendship for him.\r\nNot that I have quite shown you everything, but pretty well, I think,\r\nrespecting this man. There is a great deal concerning his character and\r\nconduct that is laid by, and I do believe, that, whatever time I should\r\ntake up in expatiating upon these things, there would be \"in the lowest\r\ndeep still a lower deep\"; for there is not a day of the inquiry that\r\ndoes not bring to light more and more of this evil against Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nBut before I open the papers relative to this act of Mr. Hastings's\r\nfriendship for Gunga Govind Sing, I must re-state some circumstances,\r\nthat your Lordships may understand thoroughly the nature of it. Your\r\nLordships may recollect, that, about the time of the succession of the\r\nminor Rajah of Dinagepore, who was then but five or six years of age,\r\nand when Mr. Hastings left Bengal eight or nine, Mr. Hastings had\r\nreceived from that country a bribe of about 40,000_l._ There is a\r\nfidelity even in bribery; there is a truth and observance even in\r\ncorruption; there is a justice, that, if money is to be paid for\r\nprotection, protection should be given. My Lords, Mr. Hastings received\r\nthis bribe through Gunga Govind Sing; then, at least, through Gunga\r\nGovind Sing he ought to take care that that Rajah should not be\r\nrobbed,--that he should not be robbed, if Gunga Govind Sing could help\r\nit,--that, above all, he should not be robbed by Gunga Govind Sing\r\nhimself. But your Lordships will find that the last act of Mr.\r\nHastings's life was to be an accomplice in the most cruel and perfidious\r\nbreach of faith, in the most iniquitous transaction, that I do believe\r\never was held out to the indignation of the world with regard to private\r\npersons. When he departed, on the 16th of February, 1785, when he was on\r\nboard, in the mouth of the Ganges, and preparing to visit his native\r\ncountry, let us see what the last act of his life then was. Hear the\r\nlast tender accents of the dying swan upon the Ganges.\r\n\r\n\"The regret which I cannot but feel in relinquishing the service of my\r\nhonorable employers would be much embittered, were it accompanied by the\r\nreflection that I have neglected the merits of a man who deserves no\r\nless of them than of myself, Gunga Govind Sing, who from his earliest\r\nyouth had been employed in the collection of the revenues, and was about\r\neleven years ago selected for his superior talents to fill the office of\r\ndewan to the Calcutta Committee. He has from that time, with a short\r\nintermission, been the principal native agent in the collection of the\r\nCompany's revenues; and I can take upon myself to say that he has\r\nperformed the duties of his office with fidelity, diligence, and\r\nability. To myself he has given proofs of a constancy and attachment\r\nwhich neither the fears nor expectations excited by the prevalence of a\r\ndifferent influence could shake,--and at a time, too, when these\r\nqualities were so dangerous, that, far from finding them amongst the\r\ngenerality of his countrymen, I did not invariably meet with them\r\namongst my own. With such a sense of his merits, it is natural that I\r\nshould feel a desire of rewarding him,--for justice, gratitude,\r\ngenerosity, and even policy, demand it; and I resort to the board for\r\nthe means of performing so necessary a duty, in full confidence, that,\r\nas those which I shall point out are neither incompatible with the\r\nCompany's interest nor prejudicial to the rights of others, they will\r\nnot be withheld from me. At the request, therefore, of Gunga Govind\r\nSing, I deliver the accompanying _durkhausts_, or petitions, for grants\r\nof lands lying in different districts, the total _jumma_, or rent, of\r\nwhich amount to Rupees 2,38,061. 12. 1.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships recollect that Mr. Larkins was one of the bribe-agents of\r\nMr. Hastings,--one, I mean, of a corporation, but not corporate in their\r\nacts. My Lords, Mr. Larkins has told you, he has told us, and he has\r\ntold the Court of Directors, that Mr. Hastings parted in a quarrel with\r\nGunga Govind Sing, because he had not faithfully kept his engagement\r\nwith regard to his bribe, and that, instead of 40,000_l._ from\r\nDinagepore, he had only paid him 30,000_l._ My Lords, that iniquitous\r\nmen will defraud one another I can conceive; but you will perceive by\r\nMr. Hastings's behavior at parting, that he either had in fact received\r\nthis money from Gunga Govind Sing, or in some way or other had abundant\r\nreason to be satisfied,--that he totally forgot his anger upon this\r\noccasion, and that at parting his last act was to ratify _grants of\r\nlands_ (so described by Mr. Hastings) to Gunga Govind Sing. Your\r\nLordships will recollect the tender and forgiving temper of Mr.\r\nHastings. Whatever little bickerings there might have been between them\r\nabout their small money concerns, the purifying waters of the Ganges had\r\nwashed away all sins, enmities, and discontent. By some of those arts\r\nwhich Gunga Govind Sing knows how to practise, (I mean conciliatory,\r\nhonest arts,) he had fairly wiped away all resentment out of Mr.\r\nHastings's mind; and he, who so long remembered the affront offered him\r\nby Cheyt Sing, totally forgets Gunga Govind Sing's fraud of 10,000_l._,\r\nand attempts to make others the instruments of giving him what he calls\r\nhis reward.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings states, among Gunga Govind's merits, that he had, from the\r\ntime of its institution, and with a very short intermission, served the\r\noffice of dewan to the Calcutta Committee. That short intermission was\r\nwhen he was turned out of office upon proof of peculation and\r\nembezzlement of public money; but of this cause of the intermission in\r\nthe political life and political merits of Gunga Govind Sing Mr.\r\nHastings does not tell you.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships shall now hear what opinion a member of the Provincial\r\nCouncil at Calcutta, in which he had also served, had of him.\r\n\r\n\"Who is Gunga Govind Sing?\" The answer is, \"He was, when I left Bengal,\r\ndewan to the Committee of Revenue.--What was his office and power during\r\nMr. Hastings's administration since 1780?--He was formerly dewan to the\r\nProvincial Council stationed at Calcutta, of which I was a member. His\r\nconduct then was licentious and unwarrantable, oppressive and\r\nextortionary. He was stationed under us to be an humble and submissive\r\nservant, and to be of use to us in the discharge of our duty. His\r\nconduct was everything the reverse. We endeavored to correct the\r\nmischiefs he was guilty of as much as possible. In one attempt to\r\nrelease fifteen persons illegally confined by him, we were dismissed our\r\noffices: a different pretence was held out for our dismission, but it\r\nwas only a pretence. Since his appointment as dewan to the present\r\nCommittee of Revenue, his line of conduct has only been a continuance of\r\nwhat I have described, but upon a larger scale.--What was the general\r\nopinion of the natives of the use he made of his power? He was looked up\r\nto by the natives as the second person in the government, if not the\r\nfirst. He was considered as the only channel for obtaining favor and\r\nemployment from the Governor. There is hardly a native family of rank or\r\ncredit within the three provinces whom he has not some time or other\r\ndistressed and afflicted; scarce a zemindary that he has not dismembered\r\nand plundered.--Were you in a situation to know this to be true?--I\r\ncertainly was.--What was the general opinion, and your own, concerning\r\nhis wealth?--It is almost impossible to form a competent judgment, his\r\nmeans of acquiring it have been so extensive. I had an account shown to\r\nme, about July, 1785, stating his acquisitions at three hundred and\r\ntwenty lacs of rupees,--that is, 3,200,000_l._\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have only to add, that, from the best inquiries I have been\r\nable to make, those who speak highest of his wealth are those who obtain\r\nthe greatest credit. The estimate of any man's wealth is uncertain; but\r\nthe enormity of his wealth is universally believed. Yet Mr. Hastings\r\nseemed to act as if he needed a reward; and it is therefore necessary to\r\ninquire what recommended him particularly to Mr. Hastings. Your\r\nLordships have seen that he was on the point of being dismissed for\r\nmisbehavior and oppression by that Calcutta Committee his services to\r\nwhich Mr. Hastings gives as one proof of his constant and uniform good\r\nbehavior. \"He had executed,\" he says, \"the duties of his office with\r\nfidelity, diligence, and ability.\" These are his public merits; but he\r\nhas private merits. \"To myself,\" says he, \"he has given proofs of\r\nconstancy and attachment.\"\r\n\r\nNow we, who have been used to look very diligently over the Company's\r\nrecords, and to compare one part with another, ask what those services\r\nwere, which have so strongly recommended him to Mr. Hastings, and\r\ninduced him to speak so favorably of his public services. What those\r\nservices are does not appear; we have searched the records for them,\r\n(and those records are very busy and loquacious,) about that period of\r\ntime during which Mr. Hastings was laboring under an eclipse, and near\r\nthe dragon's mouth, and all the drums of Bengal beating to free him from\r\nthis dangerous eclipse. During this time there is nothing publicly done,\r\nthere is nothing publicly said, by Gunga Govind Sing. There were, then,\r\nsome services of Gunga Govind Sing that lie undiscovered, which he takes\r\nas proofs of attachment. What could they be? They were not public;\r\nnobody knows anything of them; they must, by reference to the time, as\r\nfar as we can judge of them, be services of concealment: otherwise, in\r\nthe course of this business, it will be necessary, and Mr. Hastings will\r\nfind occasion, to show what those personal services of Gunga Govind\r\nSing to him were. _His_ services to Gunga Govind Sing were pretty\r\nconspicuous: for, after he was turned out for peculation, Mr. Hastings\r\nrestored him to his office; and when he had imprisoned fifteen persons\r\nillegally and oppressively, and when the Council were about to set them\r\nat liberty, they were set at liberty themselves, they were dismissed\r\ntheir offices. Your Lordships see, then, what his public services were.\r\nHis private services are unknown: they must be, as we conceive from\r\ntheir being unknown, of a suspicious nature; and I do not go further\r\nthan suspicion, because I never heard, and I have not been without\r\nattempts to make the discovery, what those services were that\r\nrecommended him to Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nHaving looked at his public services, which are well-known scenes of\r\nwickedness, barbarity, and corruption, we next come to see what his\r\nreward is. Your Lordships hear what reward he thought proper to secure\r\nfor himself; and I believe a man who has power like Gunga Govind Sing,\r\nand a disposition like Gunga Govind Sing, can hardly want the means of\r\nrewarding himself; and if every virtue rewards itself, and virtue is\r\nsaid to be its own reward, the virtue of Gunga Govind Sing was in a good\r\nway of seeking its own reward. Mr. Hastings, however, thought it was not\r\nright that such a man should reward himself, but that it was necessary\r\nfor the honor and justice of government to find him a reward. Then the\r\nnext thing is, what that reward shall be. It is a grant of lands. Your\r\nLordships will observe, that Mr. Hastings declares some of these lands\r\nto be unoccupied, others occupied, but not by the just owners. Now these\r\nwere the very lands of the Rajah of Dinagepore from whence he had taken\r\nthe bribe of 40,000_l._ My Lords, this was a monstrous thing. Mr.\r\nHastings had the audacity, as his parting act, when he was coming to\r\nEngland, and ought to have expected (whatever he did expect) the\r\nresponsibility of this day,--he was, I say, shameless enough not only to\r\ngive this recommendation, but to perpetuate the mischiefs of his reign,\r\nas he has done, to his successors: for he has really done so, by making\r\nit impossible, almost, to know anything of the true state of that\r\ncountry; and he has thereby made them much less responsible and criminal\r\nthan before in any ill acts they may have done since his time. But Mr.\r\nHastings not only recommends and backs the petition of Gunga Govind Sing\r\nwith his parting authority, which authority he made the people there\r\nbelieve would be greater in England than it was in India, but he is an\r\nevidence; he declares, that, \"to his own knowledge, these lands are\r\nvacant, and confessedly, therefore, by the laws of this as well as of\r\nmost other countries, in the absolute gift of government.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, as I said, Mr. Hastings becomes a witness, and I believe in\r\nthe course of the proceedings you will find a false witness, for Gunga\r\nGovind Sing. \"To my own knowledge,\" says he, \"they are vacant.\" Why, I\r\ncannot find that Mr. Hastings had ever been in Dinagepore; or if he had,\r\nit must have been only as a passenger. He had not the supervision of the\r\ndistrict, in any other sense than with that kind of eagle eye which he\r\nmust have had over all Bengal, and which he had for no other purposes\r\nthan those for which eagles' eyes are commonly used. He becomes, you\r\nsee, a witness for Gunga Govind Sing, and orders to be given him, as a\r\nrecompense for all the iniquitous acts this man committed, the lands of\r\nthat very Rajah who through the hands of Gunga Govind Sing had given an\r\nenormous bribe to Mr. Hastings. These lands were not without an\r\nownership, but were lands in the hands of the Rajah, and were to be\r\nsevered from the zemindary, and given to Gunga Govind Sing. The manner\r\nof obtaining them is something so shocking, and contains such a number\r\nof enormities completed in one act, that one can scarce imagine how such\r\na compound could exist.\r\n\r\nThis man, besides his office of dewan to the Calcutta Committee, which\r\ngave him the whole management and power of the revenue, was, as I have\r\nstated, at the head of all the registers in the kingdom, whose duty it\r\nwas to be a control upon him as dewan. As Mr. Hastings destroyed every\r\nother constitutional settlement of the country, so the office which was\r\nto be a check upon Gunga Govind Sing, namely, the register of the\r\ncountry, had been superseded, and revived in another shape, and given to\r\nthe own son of this very man. God forbid that a son should not be under\r\na certain and reasonable subordination! But though in this country we\r\nknow a son may possibly be free from the control of his father, yet the\r\nmeanest slave is not in a more abject condition of slavery than a son is\r\nin that country to his father; for it extends to the power of a Roman\r\nparent. The office of register is to take care that a full and fair rent\r\nis secured to government; and above all, it is his business to take care\r\nof the body of laws, the _Rawaj-ul-Mulk_, or custom of the country, of\r\nwhich he is the guardian as the head of the law. It was his business to\r\nsecure that fundamental law of the government, and fundamental law of\r\nthe country, that a zemindary cannot be split, or any portion of it\r\nseparated, without the consent of the government. This man betrayed his\r\ntrust, and did privately, contrary to the duty of his office, get this\r\nminor Rajah, who was but an infant, who was but nine years old at the\r\ntime, to make over to him a part of his zemindary, to a large amount,\r\nunder color of a fraudulent and fictitious sale. By the laws of that\r\ncountry, by the common laws of Nature, the act of this child was void.\r\nThe act was void as against the government, by giving a zemindary\r\nwithout the consent of the government to the very man who ought to have\r\nprevented such an act. He has the same sacred guardianship of minors\r\nthat the Chancellor of England has. This man got to himself those lands\r\nby a fraudulent, and probably forged deed,--for that is charged too; but\r\nwhether it was forged or not, this miserable minor was obliged to give\r\nthe lands to him: he did not dare to quarrel with him upon such an\r\narticle; because he who would purchase could take. The next step was to\r\nget one of his nearest relations to seem to give a consent; because\r\ntaking it of the minor was too gross. The relation, who could no more\r\nconsent by the law of that country than the law of this, gave apparently\r\nhis consent. And these were the very lands that Mr. Hastings speaks of\r\nas \"lands entirely at the disposal of government.\"\r\n\r\nAll this came before the Council. The moment Mr. Hastings was gone,\r\nIndia seemed a little to respire; there was a vast, oppressive weight\r\ntaken off it, there was a mountain removed from its breast; and persons\r\ndid dare then, for the first time, to breathe their complaints. And\r\naccordingly, this minor Rajah got some person kind enough to tell him\r\nthat he was a minor, that he could not part with his estate; and this,\r\nwith the other shocking and illegal parts of the process, was stated by\r\nhim to the Council, who had Mr. Hastings's recommendation of Gunga\r\nGovind Sing before them. The Council, shocked to see a minor attempted\r\nto be dispossessed in such a manner by him who was the natural guardian\r\nof all minors, shocked at such an enormous, daring piece of iniquity,\r\nbegan to inquire further, and to ask, \"How came this his near relation\r\nto consent?\" He was apparently partner in the fraud. Partner in the\r\nfraud he was, but not partner in the profit; for he was to do it without\r\ngetting anything for it: the wickedness was in him, and the profit in\r\nGunga Govind Sing. In consequence of this inquiry, the man comes down to\r\naccount for his conduct, and declares another atrocious iniquity, that\r\nshows you the powers which Gunga Govind Sing possessed. \"Gunga Govind\r\nSing,\" says he, \"is master of the country; he had made a great festival\r\nfor the burial of his mother; all those of that caste ought to be\r\ninvited to the funeral festival; he would have disgraced me forever, if\r\nI had not been invited to that funeral festival.\" These funeral\r\nfestivals, you should know, are great things in that country, and\r\ncelebrated in this manner, and, you may depend upon it, in a royal\r\nmanner by him, upon burying his mother: any person left out was marked,\r\ndespised, and disgraced. \"But he had it in his power, and I was\r\nthreatened to be deprived of my caste by his register, who had the caste\r\nin his absolute disposition.\" Says he, \"I was under terror, I was under\r\nduress, and I did it.\"\r\n\r\nGunga Govind Sing was fortified by the opinion, that the Governor,\r\nthough departed, virtually resided in that country. God grant that his\r\npower may be extirpated out of it now! I doubt it; but, most assuredly,\r\nit was residing in its plenitude when he departed from thence; and there\r\nwas not a man in India who was not of opinion, either that he was\r\nactually to return to govern India again, or that his power is such in\r\nEngland as that he might govern it here. And such were the hopes of\r\nthose who had intentions against the estates of others. Gunga Govind\r\nSing, therefore, being pressed to the wall by this declaration of the\r\nRajah's relation, when he could say nothing against it, when it was\r\nclear and manifest, and there were only impudent barefaced denials, and\r\nasseverations against facts which carried truth with themselves, did not\r\nin his answer pretend to say that a zemindary might be parted without\r\nthe consent of the government, that a minor might be deprived of it,\r\nthat the next relation had a power of disposing of it. He did indeed\r\nsay, but nobody believed him, that he had used no force upon this\r\nrelation; but as every one knew the act would be void, he was driven to\r\nMr. Hastings's great refuge,--he was driven to say, \"The government in\r\nthis country has arbitrary power; the power of government is everything,\r\nthe right of the subject nothing; they have at all times separated\r\nzemindaries from their lawful proprietors. Give me what Mr. Hastings has\r\nconstantly given to other people without any right, or shadow or\r\nsemblance of right at all.\" God knows, it is well that I walk with my\r\nauthority in my hand; for there are such crimes, such portentous,\r\nincredible crimes, to be brought before your Lordships, that it would\r\nhardly be believed, were it not that I am constantly, as I hope I shall\r\nconstantly be, guarded with evidence, and that the strongest that can\r\nbe, even the evidence of the parties themselves.\r\n\r\n\"From your inquiry,\" Gunga Govind Sing says to the Council, \"every\r\ncircumstance will appear in its true colors. With respect to the\r\nalienation of parts of zemindaries, the extent and consequence of the\r\ngreat zemindars depend in a great measure on the favor and countenance\r\nof the ruling powers. By what means did this zemindar of Dinagepore get\r\npossession of Purgunnah Buttassim after the death of Rycobad Chowdry in\r\n1158, of Purgunnah Coolygong after the death of Sahebrance Chowderanne\r\nin the same year, notwithstanding his heirs existed, and of Purgunnah\r\nSuntoe, &c., during the lifetime of Sumboonant, the zemindar, in 1167,\r\nall without right, title, or pecuniary consideration? This has been the\r\ncase with many purgunnahs in his zemindary, and indeed exists in many\r\nother zemindaries besides since the Company's accession. Ramkissen, in\r\n1172, got possession of Nurrulloor, the zemindary of Mahomed Ali. The\r\npurgunnah of Ichanguipore, &c., was in three divisions in 1173. The\r\npetition of Govind Deo Sheopersaud was made over to the son of Bousser\r\nChowdry, possessor of the third share. Purgunnah Baharbund belonged to\r\nthe zemindary of Ranny Bhowanny, and in 1180 was made over to Lucknaut\r\nNundy. All these changes took place in the lifetime of the rightful\r\npossessors, without right, title, or purchase.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have not heard before of Lucknaut Nundy. He was the son\r\nof a person of whom your Lordships have heard before, called Cantoo\r\nBaboo, the banian of Mr. Hastings. Mr. Hastings has proved in abundance\r\nof other cases that a grant to father and son is the same thing. The\r\nfathers generally take out grants in the names of their sons: and the\r\nRanny Bhowanny, possessing the zemindary of Radshi, an old lady of the\r\nfirst rank and family in India, was stripped of part of her zemindary,\r\nand it was given to Lucknaut Nundy, the son of Mr. Hastings's banian;\r\nand then (you see the consequence of good examples) comes Gunga Govind\r\nSing, and says, \"I am as good a man as he; there is a zemindary given;\r\nthen do as much for Gunga Govind Sing as you have done for Cantoo\r\nBaboo.\" Here is an argument drawn from the practice of Mr. Hastings. And\r\nthis shows your Lordships the necessity of suppressing such iniquities\r\nby punishing the author of them. You will punish Mr. Hastings, and no\r\nman will hereafter dare to rob minors, no man will hereafter dare to rob\r\nwidows, to give to the vilest of mankind, their own base instruments for\r\ntheir own nefarious purposes, the lands of others, without right, title,\r\nor purchase.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I will not after this state to you the false representation of\r\nthe value of these lands which this man gave in to government. He\r\nrepresented it to be much less than it was, when he desired the grant of\r\nthem,--as shall be stated, when it comes before your Lordships, at the\r\nproper time. But at present I am only touching upon principles, and\r\nbringing examples so far as they illustrate principles, and to show how\r\nprecedents spread.\r\n\r\nI believe your Lordships will conceive better of the spirit of these\r\ntransactions by my intermixing with them, as I shall endeavor to do, as\r\nmuch as possible of the grounds of them. I will venture to say, that no\r\ndescription that I can give, no painting, if I was either able or\r\nwilling to paint, could make these transactions appear to your Lordships\r\nwith the strength which they have in themselves; and your Lordships\r\nwill be convinced of this, when you see, what nobody could hardly\r\nbelieve, that a man can say, \"It was given to others without right,\r\ntitle, or purchase,--give it to me without right, title, or purchase;\r\ngive me the estates of minors without right, title, or purchase, because\r\nMr. Hastings gave the estates of widows without right, title, or\r\npurchase.\"\r\n\r\nOf this exemplary grant, of this pattern for future proceedings, I will\r\nshow your Lordships the consequence. I will read to your Lordships part\r\nof the examination of a witness, taken from a report of a committee of\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\"Are you acquainted with the situation of the zemindary of\r\nBaharbund?--It lies to the eastward of Dinagepore and Rungpore. I was\r\nstationed in that neighborhood.--To whom did it originally belong?--I\r\nbelieve, to the zemindary of Radshi, belonging to Ranny Bhowanny.--For\r\nwhat reason was it taken from the Ranny of Radshi and given to Cantoo\r\nBaboo?--I do not exactly recollect: I believe, on some plea of\r\nincapacity or insufficiency in her to manage it, or some pretended\r\ndecline in the revenue, owing to mismanagement.--On what terms was it\r\ngranted to Cantoo Baboo or his son?--I believe it was a grant in\r\nperpetuity, at the revenue of Rupees 82,000 or 83,000 per annum.--What\r\namount did he collect from the country?--I cannot tell. The year I was\r\nin that neighborhood, the settlement with his under-tenants was\r\nsomething above 3,53,000 rupees. The inhabitants of the country objected\r\nto it. They assembled in a body of about five thousand, and were\r\nproceeding to Calcutta to make known their grievances to the Committee\r\nof Revenue. They were stopped at Cossimbazar by Noor Sing Baboo, the\r\nbrother of Cantoo Baboo, and there the matter was compromised,--in what\r\nmanner I cannot say.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see, Mr. Hastings's banian got this zemindary belonging\r\nto this venerable lady; unable to protect herself; that it was granted\r\nto him without right, title, or purchase. To show you that Mr. Hastings\r\nhad been in a constant course of such proceeding, here is a petition\r\nfrom a person called ---- for some favor from government which it is not\r\nnecessary now to state. In order to make good his claim, he states what\r\nnobody denied, but which is universally known in fact. Says he, \"I have\r\nnever entertained any such intention or idea,\" that is, of seizing upon\r\nother people's zemindaries; \"neither am I at all desirous of acquiring\r\nany other person's zemindary in this country,\" &c....\r\n\r\n    [_The document read here is wanting, ending_] \"as several Calcutta\r\n    banians have done,\" &c.\r\n\r\nHe states it as a kind of constant practice, by which the country had\r\nbeen robbed under Mr. Hastings, known and acknowledged to be so, to\r\nseize upon the inheritance of the widow and the fatherless. In this\r\nmanner did Gunga Govind Sing govern himself, upon the direct precedent\r\nof Cantoo Baboo, the banian of Mr. Hastings; and this other instrument\r\nof his in like manner calls upon government for favor of some kind or\r\nother, upon the same principle and the same precedent.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships now see how necessary it was to say something about\r\narbitrary power. For, first, the wicked people of that country (Mr.\r\nHastings's instruments, I mean) pretend right, title, purchase, grant;\r\nand when their frauds in all these legal means are discovered, then they\r\nfly off, and have recourse to arbitrary power, and say, \"It is true I\r\ncan make out no right, title, grant, or purchase; the parties are\r\nminors; I am bound to take care of their right: but you have arbitrary\r\npower; you have exercised it upon other occasions; exercise it upon\r\nthis; give me the rights of other people.\" This was the last act, and I\r\nhope will be the last act, of Mr. Hastings's wicked power, done by the\r\nwickedest man in favor of the wickedest man, and by the wickedest means,\r\nwhich failed upon his own testimony.\r\n\r\nTo bring your Lordships to the end of this business, which I hope will\r\nlead me very near to the end of what I have to trouble your Lordships\r\nwith, I will now state the conduct of the Council, and the resolution\r\nabout Gunga Govind Sing. I am to inform your Lordships that there was a\r\nreference made by the Council to the Committee of Revenue, namely, to\r\nGunga Govind Sing himself,--a reference with regard to the right, title,\r\nmode, and proceeding, and many other circumstances; upon which the\r\nCommittee, being such as I have described, very naturally were silent.\r\nGunga Govind Sing _loquitur solus_,--in the manner you have just heard;\r\nthe Committee were the chorus,--they sometimes talk, fill up a vacant\r\npart,--but Gunga Govind Sing was the great actor, the sole one. The\r\nreport of this Committee being laid before the Council, Mr. Stables, one\r\nof the board, entered the following minute on the 15th of May, 1785.\r\n\r\n\"I have perused the several papers upon this subject, and am sorry to\r\nobserve that the Committee of Revenue are totally silent on the most\r\nmaterial points therein, and sending the petition to them has only been\r\nso much time thrown away: I mean, on the actual value of the lands in\r\nquestion, what the amount derived from them has been in the last year,\r\nand what advantages or disadvantages to government by the sale, and\r\nwhether, in their opinion, the supposed sale was compulsive or not. But\r\nit is not necessary for the discussion of the question respecting the\r\nregularity or irregularity of the pretended sale of Salbarry to Gunga\r\nGovind Sing, the dewan, to enter into the particular assertions of each\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\"The representations of the Rajah's agent, confirmed by the petitions of\r\nhis principal, positively assert the sale to have been compulsive and\r\nviolent; and the dewan as positively denies it, though the fears he\r\nexpresses, 'that their common enemies would set aside the act before it\r\nwas complete,' show clearly that they were sensible the act was\r\nunjustifiable, if they do not tend to falsify his denial.\r\n\r\n\"But it is clearly established and admitted by the language and writings\r\nof both parties, that there has been a most unwarrantable collusion in\r\nendeavoring to alienate the rights of government, contrary to the most\r\npositive original laws of the constitution of these provinces, 'that no\r\nzemindar and other landholder, paying revenue to government, shall be\r\npermitted to alienate his lands without the express authority of that\r\ngovernment.'\r\n\r\n\"The defence set up by Gunga Govind Sing does not go to disavow the\r\ntransaction; for, if it did, the deed of sale, &c., produced by himself,\r\nand the petition to the board for its confirmation, would detect him: on\r\nthe contrary, he openly admits its existence, and only strives to show\r\nthat it was a voluntary one on the part of the Ranny and the servants of\r\nthe Rajah. Whether voluntary or not, it was equally criminal in Gunga\r\nGovind Sing, as the public officer of government: because diametrically\r\nopposite to the positive and repeated standing orders of that government\r\nfor the rule of his conduct, as dewan, and native guardian of the public\r\nrights intrusted especially to his care; because it was his duty, not\r\nonly not to be guilty of a breach of those rules himself, but, as dewan,\r\nand exercising the efficient office of _kanungo_, to prevent, detect,\r\nexpose, and apprise his employers of every instance attempted to the\r\ncontrary; because it was his duty to prevent the government being\r\ndefrauded, and the Rajah, a child of nine years old, robbed of his\r\nhereditary possessions, as he would have been, if this transaction had\r\nnot been detected: whereas, on the contrary, the dewan is himself the\r\nprincipal mover and sole instrument in that fraud and robbery, if I am\r\nrightly informed, to the amount of 42,474 rupees[1] in perpetuity, by\r\nwhich he alone was to benefit; and because he has even dared to stand\r\nforward in an attempt to obtain our sanction, and thereby make us\r\nparties to (in my opinion) a false deed and fraudulent transaction, as\r\nhis own defence now shows the bill of sale and all its collateral papers\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n\"If offences of this dark tendency and magnitude were not to be punished\r\nin a public manner, the high example here set the natives employed\r\nunder the government by their first native officer would very soon\r\nrender our authority contemptible, and operate to the destruction of the\r\npublic revenues. I will not dwell further on the contradictions in these\r\npapers before us on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"But I beg leave to point out how tenacious the government have been of\r\ninsuring implicit obedience to their rules on this subject in\r\nparticular, and in prohibiting conduct like that here exhibited against\r\ntheir public officer, and how sacredly they have viewed the public\r\ninstitutes on this subject, which have been violated and trampled on;\r\nand it will suffice to show their public orders on a similar instance\r\nwhich happened some time ago, and which the dewan, from his official\r\nsituation, must have been a party in detecting.\r\n\r\n\"I desire the board's letter to the Committee on this subject, dated the\r\n31st May, 1782, may be read, and a copy be annexed to this minute.\r\n\r\n\"I therefore move the board that Gunga Govind Sing may be forthwith\r\nrequired to surrender the original deeds produced by him as a title to\r\nthe grant of Salbarry, in order that they may be returned to the Rajah's\r\nagents, to be made null and void.\r\n\r\n\"I further move the board, that the dewan, Gunga Govind Sing, together\r\nwith his naib, Prawn Kishin Sing, his son, and all his dependants, be\r\nremoved from their offices, and that the Roy Royan, Rajah Rajebullub,\r\nwhose duty only Gunga Govind Sing virtually is to perform, be reinstated\r\nin the exercise of the duties of his department; and that Gunga Govind\r\nSing be ordered to deliver up all official papers of the circar to the\r\nCommittee of Revenue and the Roy Royan, and that they be ordered\r\naccordingly to take charge of them, and finally settle all accounts.\"\r\n\r\nThis motion was overruled, and no final proceeding appears.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have heard the proceedings of the court before which Gunga\r\nGovind Sing thought proper to appeal, in consequence of the power and\r\nprotection of Mr. Hastings being understood to exist after he left\r\nIndia, and authenticated by his last parting deed. Your Lordships will\r\njudge by that last act of Mr. Hastings what the rest of his whole life\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I do not mean now to go further than just to remind your\r\nLordships of this, that Mr. Hastings's government was one whole system\r\nof oppression, of robbery of individuals, of destruction of the public,\r\nand of suppression of the whole system of the English government, in\r\norder to vest in the worst of the natives all the powers that could\r\npossibly exist in any government,--in order to defeat the ends which all\r\ngovernments ought in common to have in view. Thus, my Lords, I show you\r\nat one point of view what you are to expect from him in all the rest. I\r\nhave, I think, made out as clear as can be to your Lordships, so far as\r\nit was necessary to go, that his bribery and peculation was not\r\noccasional, but habitual,--that it was not urged upon him at the moment,\r\nbut was regular and systematic. I have shown to your Lordships the\r\noperation of such a system on the revenues.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, Mr. Hastings pleads one constant merit to justify those\r\nacts,--namely, that they produce an increase of the public revenue; and\r\naccordingly he never sells to any of those wicked agents any trusts\r\nwhatever in the country, that you do not hear that it will considerably\r\ntend to the increase of the revenue. Your Lordships will see, when he\r\nsold to wicked men the province of Bahar in the same way in which Debi\r\nSing had this province of Dinagepore, that consequences of a horrid and\r\natrocious nature, though not to so great an extent, followed from it. I\r\nwill just beg leave to state to your Lordships, that the kingdom of\r\nBahar is annexed to the kingdom of Bengal; that this kingdom was\r\ngoverned by another Provincial Council; that he turned out that\r\nProvincial Council, and sold that government to two wicked men: one of\r\nno fortune at all, and the other of a very suspicious fortune; one a\r\ntotal bankrupt, the other justly excommunicated for his wickedness in\r\nhis country, and then in prison for misdemeanors in a subordinate\r\nsituation of government. Mr. Hastings destroyed the Council that\r\nimprisoned him; and, instead of putting one of the best and most\r\nreputable of the natives to govern it, he takes out of prison this\r\nexcommunicated wretch, hated by God and man,--this bankrupt, this man of\r\nevil and desperate character, this mismanager of the public revenue in\r\nan inferior station; and, as he had given Bengal to Gunga Govind Sing,\r\nhe gave this province to Rajahs Kelleram and Cullian Sing. It was done\r\nupon this principle, that they would increase and very much better the\r\nrevenue. These men seemed to be as strange instruments for improving a\r\nrevenue as ever were chosen, I suppose, since the world began. Perhaps\r\ntheir merit was giving a bribe of 40,000_l._ to Mr. Hastings. How he\r\ndisposed of it I don't know. He says, \"I disposed of it to the public,\r\nand it was in a case of emergency.\" You will see in the course of this\r\nbusiness the falsehood of that pretence; for you will see, though the\r\nobligation is given for it as a round sum of money, that the payment\r\nwas not accomplished till a year after; that therefore it could not\r\nanswer any immediate exigence of the Company. Did it answer in an\r\nincrease of the revenue? The very reverse. Those persons who had given\r\nthis bribe of 40,000_l._ at the end of that year were found 80,000_l._\r\nin debt to the Company. The Company always loses, when Mr. Hastings\r\ntakes a bribe; and when he proposes an increase of the revenue, the\r\nCompany loses often double. But I hope and trust your Lordships will\r\nconsider this idea of a monstrous rise of rent, given by men of\r\ndesperate fortunes and characters, to be one of the grievances instead\r\nof one of the advantages of this system.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to lay these facts before you, (and I have stated\r\nthem to your Lordships far short of their reality, partly through my\r\ninfirmity, and partly on account of the odiousness of the task of going\r\nthrough things that disgrace human nature,) that you may be enabled\r\nfully to enter into the dreadful consequences which attend a system of\r\nbribery and corruption in a Governor-General. On a transient view,\r\nbribery is rather a subject of disgust than horror,--the sordid practice\r\nof a venal, mean, and abject mind; and the effect of the crime seems to\r\nend with the act. It looks to be no more than the corrupt transfer of\r\nproperty from one person to another,--at worst a theft. But it will\r\nappear in a very different light, when you regard the consideration for\r\nwhich the bribe is given,--namely, that a Governor-General, claiming an\r\narbitrary power in himself, for that consideration delivers up the\r\nproperties, the liberties, and the lives of an whole people to the\r\narbitrary discretion of any wicked and rapacious person, who will be\r\nsure to make good from their blood the purchase he has paid for his\r\npower over them. It is possible that a man may pay a bribe merely to\r\nredeem himself from some evil. It is bad, however, to live under a power\r\nwhose violence has no restraint except in its avarice. But no man ever\r\npaid a bribe for a power to charge and tax others, but with a view to\r\noppress them. No man ever paid a bribe for the handling of the public\r\nmoney, but to peculate from it. When once such offices become thus\r\nprivately and corruptly venal, the very worst men will be chosen (as Mr.\r\nHastings has in fact constantly chosen the very worst); because none but\r\nthose who do not scruple the use of any means are capable, consistently\r\nwith profit, to discharge at once the rigid demands of a severe public\r\nrevenue and the private bribes of a rapacious chief magistrate. Not only\r\nthe worst men will be thus chosen, but they will be restrained by no\r\ndread whatsoever in the execution of their worst oppressions. Their\r\nprotection is sure. The authority that is to restrain, to control, to\r\npunish them is previously engaged; he has his retaining fee for the\r\nsupport of their crimes. Mr. Hastings never dared, because he could not,\r\narrest oppression in its course, without drying up the source of his own\r\ncorrupt emolument. Mr. Hastings never dared, after the fact, to punish\r\nextortion in others, because he could not, without risking the discovery\r\nof bribery in himself. The same corruption, the same oppression, and the\r\nsame impunity will reign through all the subordinate gradations.\r\n\r\nA fair revenue may be collected without the aid of wicked, violent, and\r\nunjust instruments. But when once the line of just and legal demand is\r\ntransgressed, such instruments are of absolute necessity; and they\r\ncomport themselves accordingly. When we know that men must be well paid\r\n(and they ought to be well paid) for the performance of honorable duty,\r\ncan we think that men will be found to commit wicked, rapacious, and\r\noppressive acts with fidelity and disinterestedness for the sole\r\nemolument of dishonest employers? No: they must have their full share of\r\nthe prey, and the greater share, as they are the nearer and more\r\nnecessary instruments of the general extortion. We must not, therefore,\r\nflatter ourselves, when Mr. Hastings takes 40,000_l._ in bribes for\r\nDinagepore and its annexed provinces, that from the people nothing more\r\nthan 40,000_l._ is extorted. I speak within compass, four times forty\r\nmust be levied on the people; and these violent sales, fraudulent\r\npurchases, confiscations, inhuman and unutterable tortures,\r\nimprisonment, irons, whips, fines, general despair, general\r\ninsurrection, the massacre of the officers of revenue by the people, the\r\nmassacre of the people by the soldiery, and the total waste and\r\ndestruction of the finest provinces in India, are things of course,--and\r\nall a necessary consequence involved in the very substance of Mr.\r\nHastings's bribery.\r\n\r\nI therefore charge Mr. Hastings with having destroyed, for private\r\npurposes, the whole system of government by the six Provincial Councils,\r\nwhich he had no right to destroy.\r\n\r\nI charge him with having delegated to others that power which the act of\r\nParliament had directed him to preserve unalienably in himself.\r\n\r\nI charge him with having formed a committee to be mere instruments and\r\ntools, at the enormous expense of 62,000_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nI charge him with having appointed a person their dewan to whom these\r\nEnglishmen were to be subservient tools,--whose name, to his own\r\nknowledge, was, by the general voice of India, by the general recorded\r\nvoice of the Company, by recorded official transactions, by everything\r\nthat can make a man known, abhorred, and detested, stamped with infamy;\r\nand with giving him the whole power which he had thus separated from the\r\nCouncil-General, and from the Provincial Councils.\r\n\r\nI charge him with taking bribes of Gunga Govind Sing.\r\n\r\nI charge him with not having done that bribe-service which fidelity even\r\nin iniquity requires at the hands of the worst of men.\r\n\r\nI charge him with having robbed those people of whom he took the bribes.\r\n\r\nI charge him with having fraudulently alienated the fortunes of widows.\r\n\r\nI charge him with having, without right, title, or purchase, taken the\r\nlands of orphans, and given them to wicked persons under him.\r\n\r\nI charge him with having removed the natural guardians of a minor Rajah,\r\nand with having given that trust to a stranger, Debi Sing, whose\r\nwickedness was known to himself and all the world, and by whom the\r\nRajah, his family, and dependants were cruelly oppressed.\r\n\r\nI charge him with having committed to the management of Debi Sing three\r\ngreat provinces; and thereby with having wasted the country, ruined the\r\nlanded interest, cruelly harassed the peasants, burnt their houses,\r\nseized their crops, tortured and degraded their persons, and destroyed\r\nthe honor of the whole female race of that country.\r\n\r\nIn the name of the Commons of England, I charge all this villany upon\r\nWarren Hastings, in this last moment of my application to you.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, what is it that we want here to a great act of national\r\njustice? Do we want a cause, my Lords? You have the cause of oppressed\r\nprinces, of undone women of the first rank, of desolated provinces, and\r\nof wasted kingdoms.\r\n\r\nDo you want a criminal, my Lords? When was there so much iniquity ever\r\nlaid to the charge of any one? No, my Lords, you must not look to punish\r\nany other such delinquent from India. Warren Hastings has not left\r\nsubstance enough in India to nourish such another delinquent.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, is it a prosecutor you want? You have before you the Commons\r\nof Great Britain as prosecutors; and I believe, my Lords, that the sun,\r\nin his beneficent progress round the world, does not behold a more\r\nglorious sight than that of men, separated from a remote people by the\r\nmaterial bounds and barriers of Nature, united by the bond of a social\r\nand moral community,--all the Commons of England resenting, as their\r\nown, the indignities and cruelties that are offered to all the people of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nDo we want a tribunal? My Lords, no example of antiquity, nothing in the\r\nmodern world, nothing in the range of human imagination, can supply us\r\nwith a tribunal like this. My Lords, here we see virtually, in the\r\nmind's eye, that sacred majesty of the crown, under whose authority you\r\nsit, and whose power you exercise. We see in that invisible authority,\r\nwhat we all feel in reality and life, the beneficent powers and\r\nprotecting justice of his Majesty. We have here the heir-apparent to the\r\ncrown, such as the fond wishes of the people of England wish an\r\nheir-apparent of the crown to be. We have here all the branches of the\r\nroyal family, in a situation between majesty and subjection, between the\r\nsovereign and the subject,--offering a pledge in that situation for the\r\nsupport of the rights of the crown and the liberties of the people, both\r\nwhich extremities they touch. My Lords, we have a great hereditary\r\npeerage here,--those who have their own honor, the honor of their\r\nancestors and of their posterity to guard, and who will justify, as they\r\nhave always justified, that provision in the Constitution by which\r\njustice is made an hereditary office. My Lords, we have here a new\r\nnobility, who have risen and exalted themselves by various merits,--by\r\ngreat military services which have extended the fame of this country\r\nfrom the rising to the setting sun. We have those who, by various civil\r\nmerits and various civil talents, have been exalted to a situation which\r\nthey well deserve, and in which they will justify the favor of their\r\nsovereign, and the good opinion of their fellow-subjects, and make them\r\nrejoice to see those virtuous characters that were the other day upon a\r\nlevel with them now exalted above them in rank, but feeling with them in\r\nsympathy what they felt in common with them before. We have persons\r\nexalted from the practice of the law, from the place in which they\r\nadministered high, though subordinate, justice, to a seat here, to\r\nenlighten with their knowledge and to strengthen with their votes those\r\nprinciples which have distinguished the courts in which they have\r\npresided.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have here also the lights of our religion, you have the\r\nbishops of England. My Lords, you have that true image of the primitive\r\nChurch, in its ancient form, in its ancient ordinances, purified from\r\nthe superstitions and the vices which a long succession of ages will\r\nbring upon the best institutions. You have the representatives of that\r\nreligion which says that their God is love, that the very vital spirit\r\nof their institution is charity,--a religion which so much hates\r\noppression, that, when the God whom we adore appeared in human form, He\r\ndid not appear in a form of greatness and majesty, but in sympathy with\r\nthe lowest of the people, and thereby made it a firm and ruling\r\nprinciple that their welfare was the object of all government, since the\r\nPerson who was the Master of Nature chose to appear Himself in a\r\nsubordinate situation. These are the considerations which influence\r\nthem, which animate them, and will animate them, against all\r\noppression,--knowing that He who is called first among them, and first\r\namong us all, both of the flock that is fed and of those who feed it,\r\nmade Himself \"the servant of all.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, these are the securities which we have in all the constituent\r\nparts of the body of this House. We know them, we reckon, we rest upon\r\nthem, and commit safely the interests of India and of humanity into your\r\nhands. Therefore it is with confidence, that, ordered by the Commons,\r\n\r\nI impeach Warren Hastings, Esquire, of high crimes and misdemeanors.\r\n\r\nI impeach him in the name of the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament\r\nassembled, whose Parliamentary trust he has betrayed.\r\n\r\nI impeach him in the name of all the Commons of Great Britain, whose\r\nnational character he has dishonored.\r\n\r\nI impeach him in the name of the people of India, whose laws, rights,\r\nand liberties he has subverted, whose properties he has destroyed, whose\r\ncountry he has laid waste and desolate.\r\n\r\nI impeach him in the name and by virtue of those eternal laws of justice\r\nwhich he has violated.\r\n\r\nI impeach him in the name of human nature itself, which he has cruelly\r\noutraged, injured, and oppressed, in both sexes, in every age, rank,\r\nsituation, and condition of life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Vakeel states Mofussil Jumma, of Salbarry, for 1,191\r\n\r\n    S* R*            96,229\r\nPurchase money       53,755\r\n                     ------\r\nPer annum, loss      42,474\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECHES\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nTHE IMPEACHMENT\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nWARREN HASTINGS, ESQUIRE,\r\n\r\nLATE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF BENGAL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPEECH ON THE SIXTH ARTICLE OF CHARGE.\r\n\r\nApril and May, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     After Mr. Burke had concluded the opening speeches, the first\r\n     article of the impeachment was brought forward, on the 22d of\r\n     February, 1788, by Mr. Fox, and supported by Mr. Grey on the 25th.\r\n     After the evidence upon this article had been adduced, it was\r\n     summed up and enforced by Mr. Anstruther, on the 11th day of April\r\n     following.\r\n\r\n     The next article with which the Commons proceeded was brought\r\n     forward on the 15th of April, 1788, by Mr. Adam, and supported by\r\n     Mr. Pelham; and the evidence, in part upon the second article of\r\n     charge, was summed up and enforced, on the 3d of June, by Mr.\r\n     Sheridan.\r\n\r\n     On the 21st of April, 1789, Mr. Burke opened the sixth charge,\r\n     bribery and corruption, in the following speech, which was\r\n     continued on the 25th of April, and on the 6th and 7th May, in the\r\n     same session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nON\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH ARTICLE OF CHARGE.\r\n\r\nFIRST DAY: TUESDAY, APRIL 21, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--An event which had spread for a considerable time an\r\nuniversal grief and consternation through this kingdom, and which in its\r\nissue diffused as universal and transcendent a joy, has in the\r\ncircumstances both of our depression and of our exaltation produced a\r\nconsiderable delay, if not a total suspension, of the most important\r\nfunctions of government.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we now resume our office,--and we resume it with new and\r\nredoubled alacrity, and, we trust, under not less propitious omens than\r\nwhen we left it, in this House, at the end of the preceding session. We\r\ncome to this duty with a greater degree of earnestness and zeal, because\r\nwe are urged to it by many and very peculiar circumstances. This day we\r\ncome from an House where the last steps were taken (and I suppose\r\nsomething has happened similar in this) to prepare our way to attend\r\nwith the utmost solemnity, in another place, a great national\r\nthanksgiving for having restored the sovereign to his Parliament and the\r\nParliament to its sovereign.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, it is not only in the house of prayer that we offer to\r\nthe First Cause the acceptable homage of our rational nature,--my Lords,\r\nin this House, at this bar, in this place, in every place where His\r\ncommands are obeyed, His worship is performed. And, my Lords, I must\r\nboldly say, (and I think I shall hardly be contradicted by your\r\nLordships, or by any persons versed in the law which guides us all,)\r\nthat the highest act of religion, and the highest homage which we can\r\nand ought to pay, is an imitation of the Divine perfections, as far as\r\nsuch a nature can imitate such perfections, and that by this means alone\r\nwe can make our homage acceptable to Him.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, in His temple we shall not forget that His most distinguished\r\nattribute is justice, and that the first link in the chain by which we\r\nare held to the Supreme Judge of All is justice; and that it is in this\r\nsolemn temple of representative justice we may best give Him praise,\r\nbecause we can here best imitate His divine attributes. If ever there\r\nwas a cause in which justice and mercy are not only combined and\r\nreconciled, but incorporated, it is in this cause of suffering nations,\r\nwhich we now bring before your Lordships this second session of\r\nParliament, unwearied and unfatigued in our persevering pursuit; and we\r\nfeel it to be a necessary preliminary, a necessary fact, a necessary\r\nattendant and concomitant of every public thanksgiving, that we should\r\nexpress our gratitude by our virtues, and not merely with our mouths,\r\nand that, when we are giving thanks for acts of mercy, we should render\r\nourselves worthy of them by doing acts of mercy ourselves. My Lords,\r\nthese considerations, independent of those which were our first movers\r\nin this business, strongly urge us at present to pursue with all zeal\r\nand perseverance the great cause we have now in hand. And we feel this\r\nto be the more necessary, because we cannot but be sensible that light,\r\nunstable, variable, capricious, inconstant, fastidious minds soon tire\r\nin any pursuit that requires strength, steadiness, and perseverance.\r\nSuch persons, who we trust are but few, and who certainly do not\r\nresemble your Lordships nor us, begin already to say, How long is this\r\nbusiness to continue? Our answer is, It is to continue till its ends are\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nWe know, that, by a mysterious dispensation of Providence, injury is\r\nquick and rapid, and justice slow; and we may say that those who have\r\nnot patience and vigor of mind to attend the tardy pace of justice\r\ncounteract the order of Providence, and are resolved not to be just at\r\nall. We, therefore, instead of bending the order of Nature to the laxity\r\nof our characters and tempers, must rather confirm ourselves by a manly\r\nfortitude and virtuous perseverance to continue within those forms, and\r\nto wrestle with injustice, until we have shown that those virtues which\r\nsometimes wickedness debauches into its cause, such as vigor, energy,\r\nactivity, fortitude of spirit, are called back and brought to their true\r\nand natural service,--and that in the pursuit of wickedness, in the\r\nfollowing it through all the winding recesses and mazes of its\r\nartifices, we shall show as much vigor, as much constancy, as much\r\ndiligence, energy, and perseverance, as any others can do in endeavoring\r\nto elude the laws and triumph over the justice of their country. My\r\nLords, we have thought it the more necessary to say this, because it has\r\nbeen given out that we might faint in this business. No: we follow, and\r\ntrust we shall always follow, that great emblem of antiquity, in which\r\nthe person who held out to the end of a long line of labors found the\r\nreward of all the eleven in the twelfth. Our labor, therefore, will be\r\nour reward; and we will go on, we will pursue with vigor and diligence,\r\nin a manner suitable to the Commons of Great Britain, every mode of\r\ncorruption, till we have thoroughly eradicated it.\r\n\r\nI think it necessary to say a word, too, upon another circumstance, of\r\nwhich there is some complaint, as if some injustice had arisen from\r\nvoluntary delay on our part.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to, first, the melancholy, then the joyful\r\noccasion of this delay; and I shall now make one remark on another part\r\nof the complaint, which I understand was formally made to your Lordships\r\nsoon after we had announced our resolution to proceed in this great\r\ncause of suffering nations before you. It has been alleged, that the\r\nlength of the pursuit had already very much distressed the person who is\r\nthe object of it,--that it leaned upon a fortune unequal to support\r\nit,--and that 30,000_l._ had been already spent in the preliminary\r\npreparations for the defence.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I do admit that all true, genuine, and unadulterated justice\r\nconsiders with a certain degree of tenderness the person whom it is\r\ncalled to punish, and never oppresses those by the process who ought not\r\nto be oppressed but by the sentence of the court before which they are\r\nbrought. The Commons have heard, indeed, with some degree of\r\nastonishment, that 30,000_l._ hath been laid out by Mr. Hastings in this\r\nbusiness. We, who have some experience in the conduct of affairs of this\r\nnature, we, who profess to proceed with regard not to the economy so\r\nmuch as to the rigor of this prosecution, (and we are justified by our\r\ncountry in so doing,) upon a collation and comparison of the public\r\nexpenses with those which the defendant is supposed to have incurred,\r\nare much surprised to hear it. We suppose that his solicitors can give a\r\ngood account to him of those expenses,--that the thing is true,--and\r\nthat he has actually, through them, incurred this expense. We have\r\nnothing to do with this: but we shall remove any degree of uneasiness\r\nfrom your Lordships' minds, and from our own, when we show you in the\r\ncharge which we shall bring before you this day, that one bribe only\r\nreceived by Mr. Hastings, the smallest of his bribes, or nearly the\r\nsmallest, the bribe received from Rajah Nobkissin, is alone more than\r\nequal to have paid all the charges Mr. Hastings is stated to have\r\nincurred; and if this be the case, your Lordships will not be made very\r\nuneasy in a case of bribery by finding that you press upon the sources\r\nof peculation.\r\n\r\nIt has also been said that we weary out the public patience in this\r\ncause. The House of Commons do not call upon your Lordships to do\r\nanything of which they do not set the example. They have very lately sat\r\nin the Colchester Committee as many, within one or two, days\r\nsuccessively as have been spent in this trial interruptedly in the\r\ncourse of two years. Every cause deserves that it should be tried\r\naccording to its nature and circumstances; and in the case of the\r\nColchester Committee, in the trial of paltry briberies of odd pounds,\r\nshillings, and pence, in the corruption of a returning officer, who is\r\nbut a miller, they spent nearly the same number of days that we have\r\nbeen inquiring into the ruin of kingdoms by the peculation and bribery\r\nof the chief governor of the provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa.\r\nTherefore God forbid that we should faint at thrice thirty days, if the\r\nproceedings should be drawn into such a length, when for a small crime\r\nas much time has been spent as has yet been spent in this great cause!\r\n\r\nHaving now cleared the way with regard to the local and temporary\r\ncircumstances of this case,--having shown your Lordships that too much\r\ntime has not been spent in it,--having no reason to think, from the time\r\nwhich has hitherto been spent, that time will be unnecessarily spent in\r\nfuture,--I trust your Lordships will think that time ought neither to be\r\nspared nor squandered in this business: we will therefore proceed,\r\narticle by article, as far as the discretion of the House of Commons\r\nshall think fit, for the justice of the case, to limit the inquiry, or\r\nto extend it.\r\n\r\nWe are now going to bring before your Lordships the sixth article. It is\r\nan article of charge of bribery and corruption against Mr. Hastings; but\r\nyet we must confess that we feel some little difficulty _in limine_. We\r\nhere appear in the name and character not only of representatives of the\r\nCommons of Great Britain, but representatives of the inhabitants of\r\nBengal: and yet we have had lately come into our hands such ample\r\ncertificates, such full testimonials, from every person in whose cause\r\nwe complain, that we shall appear to be in the strangest situation in\r\nthe world,--the situation of persons complaining, who are disavowed by\r\nthe persons in whose name and character they complain. This would have\r\nbeen a very great difficulty in the beginning, especially as it is come\r\nbefore us in a flood-tide of panegyric. No encomium can be more exalted\r\nor more beautifully expressed. No language can more strongly paint the\r\nperfect satisfaction, the entire acquiescence, of all the nations of\r\nBengal, and their wonderful admiration of the character of the person\r\nwhom we have brought as a criminal to your bar upon their part. I do\r\nadmit that it is a very awkward circumstance; but yet, at the same time,\r\nthe same candor which has induced the House of Commons to bring before\r\nyou the bosom friends and confidants of Mr. Hastings as their evidence\r\nwill not suffer them to suppress or withhold for a moment from your\r\nLordships this universal voice of Bengal, as an attestation in Mr.\r\nHastings's favor, and we shall produce it as a part of our evidence. Oh,\r\nmy Lords, consider the situation of a people who are forced to mix their\r\npraises with their groans, who are forced to sign, with hands which have\r\nbeen in torture, and with the thumb-screws but just taken from them, an\r\nattestation in favor of the person from whom all their sufferings have\r\nbeen derived! When we prove to you the things that we shall prove, this\r\nwill, I hope, give your Lordships a full, conclusive, and satisfactory\r\nproof of the misery to which these people have been reduced. You will\r\nsee before you, what is so well expressed by one of our poets as the\r\nhomage of tyrants, \"that homage with the mouth which the heart would\r\nfain deny, but dares not.\" Mr. Hastings has received that homage, and\r\nthat homage we mean to present to your Lordships: we mean to present it,\r\nbecause it will show your Lordships clearly, that, after Mr. Hastings\r\nhas ransacked Bengal from one end to the other, and has used all the\r\npower which he derives from having every friend and every dependant of\r\nhis in every office from one end of that government to the other, he has\r\nnot, in all those panegyrics, those fine high-flown Eastern encomiums,\r\ngot one word of refutation or one word of evidence against any charge\r\nwhatever which we produce against him. Every one knows, that, in the\r\ncourse of criminal trials, when no evidence of _alibi_ can be brought,\r\nwhen all the arts of the Old Bailey are exhausted, the last thing\r\nproduced is evidence to character. His cause, therefore, is gone, when,\r\nhaving ransacked Bengal, he has nothing to say for his conduct, and at\r\nlength appeals to his character. In those little papers which are given\r\nus of our proceedings in our criminal courts, it is always an omen of\r\nwhat is to follow: after the evidence of a murder, a forgery, or\r\nrobbery, it ends in his character: \"He has an admirable character; I\r\nhave known him from a boy; he is wonderfully good; he is the best of\r\nmen; I would trust him with untold gold\": and immediately follows,\r\n\"Guilty,--Death.\" This is the way in which, in our courts, character is\r\ngenerally followed by sentence. The practice is not modern. Undoubtedly\r\nMr. Hastings has the example of criminals of high antiquity; for Caius\r\nVerres, Antonius, and every other man who has been famous for the\r\npillage and destruction of provinces, never failed to bring before their\r\njudges the attestations of the injured to their character. Voltaire\r\nsays, \"_Les bons mots sont toujours redits_.\" A similar occasion has\r\nhere produced a similar conduct. He has got just the same character as\r\nCaius Verres got in another cause; and the _laudationes_, which your\r\nLordships know always followed, to save trouble, we mean ourselves to\r\ngive your Lordships; we mean to give them with this strong presumption\r\nof guilt, that in all this panegyric there is not one word of defence to\r\na single article of charge; they are mere lip-honors: but we think we\r\nderive from those panegyrics, which Mr. Hastings has had sent over as\r\nevidence to supply the total want of it, an indication of the\r\nimpossibility of attaining it. Mr. Hastings has brought them here, and I\r\nmust say we are under some difficulty about them, and the difficulty is\r\nthis. We think we can produce before your Lordships proofs of barbarity\r\nand peculation by Mr. Hastings; we have the proofs of them in specific\r\nprovinces, where those proofs may be met by contrary proofs, or may lose\r\ntheir weight from a variety of circumstances. We thought we had got the\r\nmatter sure, that everything was settled, that he could not escape us,\r\nafter he had himself confessed the bribes he had taken from the specific\r\nprovinces. But in what condition are we now? We have from those specific\r\nprovinces the strongest attestations that there is not any credit to be\r\npaid to his own acknowledgments. In short, we have the complaints,\r\nconcerning these crimes of Mr. Hastings, of the injured persons\r\nthemselves; we have his own confessions; we shall produce both to your\r\nLordships. But these persons now declare, that not only their own\r\ncomplaints are totally unfounded, but that Mr. Hastings's confessions\r\nare not true, and not to be credited. These are circumstances which your\r\nLordships will consider in the view you take of this wonderful body of\r\nattestation.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasant thing to see in these addresses the different character\r\nand modes of eloquence of different countries. In those that will be\r\nbrought before your Lordships you will see the beauty of chaste European\r\npanegyric improved by degrees into high, Oriental, exaggerated, and\r\ninflated metaphor. You will see how the language is first written in\r\nEnglish, then translated into Persian, and then retranslated into\r\nEnglish. There may be something amusing to your Lordships in this, and\r\nthe beauty of these styles may, in this heavy investigation, tend to\r\ngive a little gayety and pleasure. We shall bring before you the\r\nEuropean and Asiatic incense. You will have the perfume-shops of the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nOne of the accusations which we mean to bring against Mr. Hastings is\r\nupon the part of the Zemindar Radanaut, of the country of Dinagepore.\r\nNow hear what the Zemindar says himself. \"As it has been learned by me,\r\nthe mutsuddies, and the respectable officers of my zemindary, that the\r\nministers of England are displeased with the late Governor, Warren\r\nHastings, Esquire, upon the suspicion that he oppressed us, took money\r\nfrom us by deceit and force, and ruined the country, therefore we, upon\r\nthe strength of our religion, which we think it incumbent on and\r\nnecessary for us to abide by, following the rules laid down in giving\r\nevidence, declare the particulars of the acts and deeds of Warren\r\nHastings, Esquire, full of circumspection and caution, civility and\r\njustice, superior to the conduct of the most learned, and, by\r\nrepresenting what is fact, wipe away the doubts that have possessed the\r\nminds of the ministers of England; that Mr. Hastings is possessed of\r\nfidelity and confidence, and yielding protection to us; that he is clear\r\nof the contamination of mistrust and wrong, and his mind is free of\r\ncovetousness or avarice. During the time of his administration no one\r\nsaw other conduct than that of protection to the husbandman, and\r\njustice. No inhabitant ever experienced afflictions, no one ever felt\r\noppression from him; our reputations have always been guarded from\r\nattacks by his prudence, and our families have always been protected by\r\nhis justice. He never omitted the smallest instance of kindness towards\r\nus, but healed the wounds of despair with the salve of consolation by\r\nmeans of his benevolent and kind behavior, never permitting one of us to\r\nsink in the pit of despondence. He supported every one by his goodness,\r\noverset the designs of evil-minded men by his authority, tied the hand\r\nof oppression with the strong bandage of justice, and by these means\r\nexpanded the pleasing appearance of happiness and joy over us. He\r\nreëstablished justice and impartiality. We were during his government in\r\nthe enjoyment of perfect happiness and ease, and many of us are thankful\r\nand satisfied. As Mr. Hastings was well acquainted with our manners and\r\ncustoms, he was always desirous, in every respect, of doing whatever\r\nwould preserve our religious rites, and guard them against every kind of\r\naccident and injury, and at all times protected us. Whatever we have\r\nexperienced from him, and whatever happened from him, we have written\r\nwithout deceit or exaggeration.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here is a panegyric; and, directly contrary to the usual mode\r\nof other accusers, we begin by producing the panegyrics made upon the\r\nperson whom we accuse. We shall produce along with the charge, and give\r\nas evidence, the panegyric and certificate of the persons whom we\r\nsuppose to have suffered these wrongs. We suffer ourselves even to\r\nabandon, what might be our last resource, his own confession, by showing\r\nthat one of the princes from whom he confesses that he took bribes has\r\ngiven a certificate of the direct contrary.\r\n\r\nAll these things will have their weight upon your Lordships' minds; and\r\nwhen we have put ourselves under this disadvantage, (what disadvantage\r\nit is your Lordships will judge,) at least we shall stand acquitted of\r\nunfairness in charging him with crimes directly contrary to the\r\npanegyrics in this paper contained. Indeed, I will say this for him,\r\nthat general charge and loose accusation may be answered by loose and\r\ngeneral panegyric, and that, if ours were of that nature, this panegyric\r\nwould be sufficient to overset our accusation. But we come before your\r\nLordships in a different manner and upon different grounds. I am ordered\r\nby the Commons of Great Britain to support the charge that they have\r\nmade, and persevere in making, against Warren Hastings, Esquire, late\r\nGovernor-General of Bengal, and now a culprit at your bar: First, for\r\nhaving taken corruptly several bribes, and extorted by force, or under\r\nthe power and color of his office, several sums of money from the\r\nunhappy natives of Bengal. The next article which we shall bring before\r\nyou is, that he is not only personally corrupted, but that he has\r\npersonally corrupted all the other servants of the Company,--those under\r\nhim, whose corruptions he ought to have controlled, and those above him,\r\nwhose business it was to control his corruptions.\r\n\r\nWe purpose to make good to your Lordships the first of these, by\r\nsubmitting to you, that part of those sums which are specified in the\r\ncharge were taken by him with his own hand and in his own person, but\r\nthat much the greater part have been taken from the natives by the\r\ninstrumentality of his black agents, banians, and other\r\ndependants,--whose confidential connection with him, and whose agency on\r\nhis part in corrupt transactions, if his counsel should be bold enough\r\nto challenge us to the proof, we shall fully prove before you. The next\r\npart, and the second branch of his corruption, namely, what is commonly\r\ncalled his active corruption, distinguishing the personal under the name\r\nof passive, will appear from his having given, under color of contracts,\r\na number of corrupt and lucrative advantages from a number of\r\nunauthorized and unreasonable grants, pensions, and allowances, by which\r\nhe corrupted actively the whole service of the Company. And, lastly, we\r\nshall show, that, by establishing a universal connivance from one end of\r\nthe service to the other, he has not only corrupted and contaminated it\r\nin all its parts, but bound it in a common league of iniquity to support\r\nmutually each other against the inquiry that should detect and the\r\njustice that should punish their offences. These two charges, namely, of\r\nhis active and passive corruption, we shall bring one after the other,\r\nas strongly and clearly illustrating and as powerfully confirming each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe first which we shall bring before you is his own passive\r\ncorruption,--so we commonly call it. Bribes are so little known in this\r\ncountry that we can hardly get clear and specific technical names to\r\ndistinguish them; but in future, I am afraid, the conduct of Mr.\r\nHastings will improve our law vocabulary. The first, then, of these\r\noffences with which Mr. Hastings stands charged here is receiving bribes\r\nhimself, or through his banians. Every one of these are overt acts of\r\nthe general charge of bribery, and they are every one of them,\r\nseparately taken, substantive crimes. But whatever the criminal nature\r\nof these acts was, (and the nature was very criminal, and the\r\nconsequences to the country very dreadful,) yet we mean to prove to your\r\nLordships that they were not single acts, that they were not acts\r\ncommitted as opportunity offered, or as necessity tempted or urged upon\r\nthe occasion, but that they are parts of a general systematic plan of\r\ncorruption, for advancing his fortune at the expense of his integrity;\r\nthat he has, for that purpose, not only taken the opportunity of his own\r\npower, but made whole establishments, altered and perverted others, and\r\ncreated complete revolutions in the country's government, for the\r\npurpose of making the power which ought to be subservient to legal\r\ngovernment subservient to corruption; that, when he could no longer\r\ncover these fraudulent proceedings by artifice, he endeavored to justify\r\nthem by principle. These artifices we mean to detect; these principles\r\nwe mean to attack, and, with your Lordships' aid, to demolish, destroy,\r\nand subvert forever.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I must say, that in this business, which is a matter of\r\ncollusion, concealment, and deceit, your Lordships will, perhaps, not\r\nfeel the same degree of interest as in the others. Hitherto you have had\r\nbefore you crimes of dignity: you have had before you the ruin and\r\nexpulsion of great and illustrious families, the breach of solemn public\r\ntreaties, the merciless pillage and total subversion of the first houses\r\nin Asia. But the crimes which are the most striking to the imagination\r\nare not always the most pernicious in their effects: in these high,\r\neminent acts of domineering tyranny, their very magnitude proves a sort\r\nof corrective to their virulence. The occasions on which they can be\r\nexercised are rare; the persons upon whom they can be exercised few; the\r\npersons who can exercise them, in the nature of things, are not many.\r\nThese high tragic acts of superior, overbearing tyranny are privileged\r\ncrimes; they are the unhappy, dreadful prerogative, they are the\r\ndistinguished and incommunicable attributes, of superior wickedness in\r\neminent station.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, when the vices of low, sordid, and illiberal minds infect\r\nthat high situation,--when theft, bribery, and peculation, attended with\r\nfraud, prevarication, falsehood, misrepresentation, and forgery--when\r\nall these follow in one train,--when these vices, which gender and spawn\r\nin dirt, and are nursed in dunghills, come and pollute with their slime\r\nthat throne which ought to be a seat of dignity and purity, the evil is\r\nmuch greater; it may operate daily and hourly; it is not only imitable,\r\nbut improvable, and it will be imitated, and will be improved, from the\r\nhighest to the lowest, through all the gradations of a corrupt\r\ngovernment. They are reptile vices. There are situations in which the\r\nacts of the individual are of some moment, the example comparatively of\r\nlittle importance. In the other, the mischief of the example is\r\ninfinite.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, when once a Governor-General receives bribes, he gives a\r\nsignal to universal pillage to all the inferior parts of the service.\r\nThe bridles upon hard-mouthed passion are removed; they are taken away;\r\nthey are broken. Fear and shame, the great guards to virtue next to\r\nconscience, are gone. Shame! how can it exist?--it will soon blush away\r\nits awkward sensibility. Shame, my Lords, cannot exist long, when it is\r\nseen that crimes which naturally bring disgrace are attended with all\r\nthe outward symbols, characteristics, and rewards of honor and of\r\nvirtue,--when it is seen that high station, great rank, general\r\napplause, vast wealth follow the commission of peculation and bribery.\r\nIs it to be believed that men can long be ashamed of that which they see\r\nto be the road to honor? As to fear, let a Governor-General once take\r\nbribes, there is an end of all fear in the service. What have they to\r\nfear? Is it the man whose example they follow that is to bring them\r\nbefore a tribunal for their punishment? Can he open any inquiry? He\r\ncannot: he that opens a channel of inquiry under these circumstances\r\nopens a high-road to his own detection. Can he make any laws to prevent\r\nit? None: for he can make no laws to restrain that practice without the\r\nbreach of his own laws immediately in his own conduct. If we once can\r\nadmit, for a single instant, in a Governor-General, a principle, however\r\ndefended, upon any pretence whatever, to receive bribes in consequence\r\nof his office, there is an end of all virtue, an end of the laws, and no\r\nhope left in the supreme justice of the country. We are sensible of all\r\nthese difficulties; we have felt them; and perhaps it has required no\r\nsmall degree of exertion for us to get the better of these difficulties\r\nwhich are thrown in our way by a Governor-General accepting bribes, and\r\nthereby screening and protecting the whole service in such iniquitous\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this matter, we are to state to your Lordships, in order\r\nto bring it fully and distinctly before you, what the nature of this\r\ndistemper of bribery is in the Indian government. We are to state what\r\nthe laws and rules are which have been opposed to prevent it, and the\r\nutter insufficiency of all that have been proposed: to state the\r\ngrievance, the instructions of the Company and government, the acts of\r\nParliament, the constructions upon the acts of Parliament. We are to\r\nstate to your Lordships the particular situation of Mr. Hastings; we are\r\nto state the trust the Company had in him for the prevention of all\r\nthose evils; and then we are to prove that every evil, that all those\r\ngrievances which the law intended to prevent, which there were covenants\r\nto restrain, and with respect to which there were encouragements to\r\nsmooth and make easy the path of duty, Mr. Hastings was invested with a\r\nspecial, direct, and immediate trust to prevent. We are to prove to your\r\nLordships that he is the man who, in his own person collectively, has\r\ndone more mischief than all those persons whose evil practices have\r\nproduced all those laws, those regulations, and even his own\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that we shall do is to state, and which we shall prove\r\nin evidence, that this vice of bribery was the ancient, radical,\r\nendemical, and ruinous distemper of the Company's affairs in India, from\r\nthe time of their first establishment there. Very often there are no\r\nwords nor any description which can adequately convey the state of a\r\nthing like the direct evidence of the thing itself: because the former\r\nmight be suspected of exaggeration; you might think that which was\r\nreally fact to be nothing but the coloring of the person that explained\r\nit; and therefore I think that it will be much better to give to your\r\nLordships here a direct state of the Presidency at the time when the\r\nCompany enacted those covenants which Mr. Hastings entered into, and\r\nwhen they took those measures to prevent the very evils from persons\r\nplaced in those very stations and in those very circumstances in which\r\nwe charge Mr. Hastings with having committed the offences we now bring\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nI wish your Lordships to know that we are going to read a consultation\r\nof Lord Clive's, who was sent out for the express purpose of reforming\r\nthe state of the Company, in order to show the magnitude of the\r\npecuniary corruptions that prevailed in it.\r\n\r\n    \"It is from a due sense of the regard we owe and profess to your\r\n    interests and to our own honor, that we think it indispensably\r\n    necessary to lay open to your view a series of transactions too\r\n    notoriously known to be suppressed, and too affecting to your\r\n    interest, to the national character, and to the existence of the\r\n    Company in Bengal, to escape unnoticed and uncensured,--transactions\r\n    which seem to demonstrate that every spring of this government was\r\n    smeared with corruption, that principles of rapacity and oppression\r\n    universally prevailed, and that every spark of sentiment and public\r\n    spirit was lost and extinguished in the unbounded lust of unmerited\r\n    wealth.\r\n\r\n    \"To illustrate these positions, we must exhibit to your view a most\r\n    unpleasing variety of complaints, inquiries, accusations, and\r\n    vindications, the particulars of which are entered in our\r\n    Proceedings and the Appendix,--assuring you that we undertake this\r\n    task with peculiar reluctance, from the personal regard we entertain\r\n    for some of the gentlemen whose characters will appear to be deeply\r\n    affected.\r\n\r\n    \"At Fort St. George we received the first advices of the demise of\r\n    Mir Jaffier and of Sujah Dowlah's defeat. It was there firmly\r\n    imagined that no definite measures would be taken, either in respect\r\n    to a peace or filling the vacancy in the nizamut, before our\r\n    arrival,--as the 'Lapwing' arrived in the month of January with your\r\n    general letter, and the appointment of a committee with express\r\n    powers to that purpose, for the successful exertion of which the\r\n    happiest occasion now offered. However, a contrary resolution\r\n    prevailed in the Council. The opportunity of acquiring immense\r\n    fortunes was too inviting to be neglected, and the temptation too\r\n    powerful to be resisted. A treaty was hastily drawn up by the board,\r\n    or rather transcribed, with few unimportant additions, from that\r\n    concluded with Mir Jaffier,--and a deputation, consisting of Messrs.\r\n    Johnstone, senior, Middleton, and Leycester, appointed to raise the\r\n    natural son of the deceased Nabob to the subahdarry, in prejudice of\r\n    the claim of the grandson; and for this measure such reasons are\r\n    assigned as ought to have dictated a diametrically opposite\r\n    resolution. Meeran's son was a minor, which circumstance alone would\r\n    have naturally brought the whole administration into our hands, at a\r\n    juncture when it became indispensably necessary we should realize\r\n    that shadow of power and influence which, having no solid\r\n    foundation, was exposed to the danger of being annihilated by the\r\n    first stroke of adverse fortune. But this inconsistence was not\r\n    regarded; nor was it material to the views for precipitating the\r\n    treaty, which was pressed on the young Nabob at the first interview,\r\n    in so earnest and indelicate a manner as highly disgusted him and\r\n    chagrined his ministers; while not a single rupee was stipulated for\r\n    the Company, whose interests were sacrificed, that their servants\r\n    might revel in the spoils of a treasury before impoverished, but now\r\n    totally exhausted.\r\n\r\n    \"This scene of corruption was first disclosed, at a visit the Nabob\r\n    was paid, to Lord Clive and the gentlemen of the Committee, a few\r\n    days after our arrival. He there delivered to his Lordship a letter\r\n    filled with bitter complaints of the insults and indignities he had\r\n    been exposed to, and the embezzlement of near twenty lacs of rupees,\r\n    issued from his treasury for purposes unknown, during the late\r\n    negotiations. So public a complaint could not be disregarded, and it\r\n    soon produced an inquiry. We referred the letter to the board, in\r\n    expectation of obtaining a satisfactory account of the application\r\n    of this money, and were answered only by a warm remonstrance entered\r\n    by Mr. Leycester against that very Nabob in whose elevation he\r\n    boasts of having been a principal agent.\r\n\r\n    \"Mahomed Reza Khân, the Naib Subah, was then called upon to account\r\n    for this large disbursement from the treasury; and he soon delivered\r\n    to the Committee the very extraordinary narrative entered in our\r\n    Proceedings the 6th of June, wherein he specifies the several names\r\n    and sums, by whom paid, and to whom, whether in cash, bills, or\r\n    obligations. So precise, so accurate an account as this of money for\r\n    secret and venal services was never, we believe, before this period,\r\n    exhibited to the Honorable Court of Directors,--at least, never\r\n    vouched by such undeniable testimony and authentic documents: by\r\n    Juggut Seet, who himself was obliged to contribute largely to the\r\n    sums demanded; by Muley Ram, who was employed by Mr. Johnstone in\r\n    all those pecuniary transactions; by the Nabob and Mahomed Reza\r\n    Khân, who were the heaviest sufferers; and, lastly, by the\r\n    confession of the gentlemen themselves whose names are specified in\r\n    the distribution list.\r\n\r\n    \"Juggut Seet expressly declared in his narrative, that the sum which\r\n    he agreed to pay the deputation, amounting to 125,000 rupees, was\r\n    extorted by menaces; and since the close of our inquiry, and the\r\n    opinions we delivered in the Proceedings of the 21st June, it fully\r\n    appears that the presents from the Nabob and Mahomed Reza Khân,\r\n    exceeding the immense sum of seventeen lacs, were not the voluntary\r\n    offerings of gratitude, but contributions levied on the weakness of\r\n    the government, and violently exacted from the dependent state and\r\n    timid disposition of the minister. The charge, indeed, is denied on\r\n    the one hand, as well as affirmed on the other. Your honorable board\r\n    must therefore determine how far the circumstance of extortion may\r\n    aggravate the crime of disobedience to your positive orders, the\r\n    exposing the government in a manner to sale, and receiving the\r\n    infamous wages of corruption from opposite parties and contending\r\n    interests. We speak with boldness, because we speak from conviction\r\n    founded upon indubitable facts, that, besides the above sums\r\n    specified in the distribution account to the amount of 228,125\r\n    pounds sterling, there was likewise to the value of several lacs of\r\n    rupees procured from Nundcomar and Roydullub, each of whom aspired\r\n    at and obtained a promise of that very employment it was\r\n    predetermined to bestow on Mahomed Reza Khân.\r\n\r\n    (Signed at the end)\r\n\r\n            \"CLIVE.\r\n            W^M B.

This grievance,\r\ntherefore, so authenticated, so great, and described in so many\r\ncircumstances, I think it might be sufficient for me, in this part of\r\nthe business, to show was, when Mr. Hastings was sent to India, a\r\nprevalent evil.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, it is necessary that I should show to you something more,\r\nbecause, _prima fronte_, this is some exculpation of Mr. Hastings: for,\r\nif he was only a partaker in a general misconduct, it was rather _vitium\r\nloci et vitium temporis_ than _vitium hominis_. This might be said in\r\nhis exculpation. But I am next to show your Lordships the means which\r\nthe Company took for removing this grievance; and that Mr. Hastings's\r\npeculiar trust, the great specific ground of his appointment, was a\r\nconfidence that he would eradicate this very evil, of which we are going\r\nto prove that he has been one of the principal promoters. I wish your\r\nLordships to advert to one particular circumstance,--namely, that the\r\ntwo persons who were bidders at this time, and at this auction of\r\ngovernment, for the favor and countenance of the Presidency at Calcutta,\r\nwere Mahomed Reza Khân and Rajah Nundcomar. I wish your Lordships to\r\nrecollect this by-and-by, when we shall bring before you the very same\r\ntwo persons, who, in the same sort of transaction, and in circumstances\r\nexactly similar, or very nearly so, were candidates for the favor of Mr.\r\nHastings.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, our next step will be to show you that the Company in 1768 had\r\nmade a covenant expressly forbidding the taking of presents of above\r\n400_l._ value in each present by the Governor-General. I take it for\r\ngranted, this will not be much litigated. They renewed and enforced that\r\nwith other covenants and other instructions; and at last came an act of\r\nParliament, in the clearest, the most definite, the most specific words\r\nthat all the wisdom of the legislature, intent upon the eradication of\r\nthis evil, could use, to prevent the receiving of presents.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I think it is necessary to state, that there has been some\r\nlittle difficulty concerning this word, _presents_. Bribery and\r\nextortion have been covered by the name of presents, and the authority\r\nand practice of the East has been adduced as a palliation of the crime.\r\nMy Lords, no authority of the East will be a palliation of the breach of\r\nlaws enacted in the West: and to those laws of the West, and not the\r\nvicious customs of the East, we insist upon making Mr. Hastings liable.\r\nBut do not your Lordships see that this is an entire mistake? that there\r\nnever was any custom of the East for it? I do not mean vicious practices\r\nand customs, which it is the business of good laws and good customs to\r\neradicate. There are three species of presents known in the East,--two\r\nof them payments of money known to be legal, and the other perfectly\r\nillegal, and which has a name exactly expressing it in the manner our\r\nlanguage does. It is necessary that your Lordships should see that Mr.\r\nHastings has made use of a perversion of the names of authorized gifts\r\nto cover the most abominable and prostituted bribery. The first of those\r\npresents is known in the country by the name of _peshcush_: this\r\n_peshcush_ is a fine paid, upon the grant of lands, to the sovereign, or\r\nwhoever grants them. The second is the _nuzzer_, or _nuzzerana_, which\r\nis a tribute of acknowledgment from an inferior to a superior. The last\r\nis called _reshwat_, in the Persian language,--that is to say, a bribe,\r\nor sum of money clandestinely and corruptly taken,--and is as much\r\ndistinguished from the others as, in the English language, a fine or\r\nacknowledgment is distinguished from a bribe. To show your Lordships\r\nthis, we shall give in evidence, that, whenever a peshcush or fine is\r\npaid, it is a sum of money publicly paid, and paid in proportion to the\r\ngrant,--and that the sum is entered upon the very grant itself. We shall\r\nprove the nuzzer is in the same manner entered, and that all legal fees\r\nare indorsed upon the body of the grant for which they are taken: and\r\nthat they are no more in the East than in the West any kind of color or\r\npretence for corrupt acts, which are known by the circumstance of their\r\nbeing clandestinely taken, and which are acknowledged and confessed to\r\nbe illegal and corrupt. Having stated that Mr. Hastings, in some of the\r\nevidence that we shall produce, endeavors to confound these three\r\nthings, I am only to remark that the nuzzer is generally a very small\r\nsum of money, that it sometimes amounts to one gold mohur, that\r\nsometimes it is less, and that, in all the records of the Company, I\r\nhave never known it exceed one gold mohur, or about thirty-five\r\nshillings,--passing by the fifty gold mohurs which were given to Mr.\r\nHastings by Cheyt Sing, and a hundred gold mohurs which were given to\r\nthe Mogul, as a nuzzer, by Mahomed Ali, Nabob of Arcot.\r\n\r\nThe Company, seeing that this nuzzer, though small in each sum, might\r\namount at last to a large tax upon the country, (and it did so in fact,)\r\nthought proper to prohibit any sum of money to be taken upon any pretext\r\nwhatever; and the Company in the year 1775 did expressly explode the\r\nwhole doctrine of peshcush, nuzzer, and every other private lucrative\r\nemolument, under whatever name, to be taken by the Governor-General, and\r\ndid expressly send out an order that that was the construction of the\r\nact, and that he was not even to take a nuzzer. Thus we shall show that\r\nthat act had totally cut up the whole system of bribery and corruption,\r\nand that Mr. Hastings had no sort of color whatever for taking the money\r\nwhich we shall prove he has taken.\r\n\r\nI know that positive prohibitions, that acts of Parliament, that\r\ncovenants, are things of very little validity indeed, as long as all the\r\nmeans of corruption are left in power, and all the temptations to\r\ncorrupt profit are left in poverty. I should really think that the\r\nCompany deserved to be ill served, if they had not annexed such\r\nappointments to great trusts as might secure the persons intrusted from\r\nthe temptations of unlawful emolument, and, what in all cases is the\r\ngreatest security, given a lawful gratification to the natural passions\r\nof men. Matrimony is to be used, as a true remedy against a vicious\r\ncourse of profligate manners; fair and lawful emoluments, and the just\r\nprofits of office, are opposed to the unlawful means which might be made\r\nuse of to supply them. For, in truth, I am ready to agree, that for any\r\nman to expect a series of sacrifices without a return in blessings, to\r\nexpect labor without a prospect of reward, and fatigue without any means\r\nof securing rest, is an unreasonable demand in any human creature from\r\nanother. Those who trust that they shall find in men uncommon and heroic\r\nvirtues are themselves endeavoring to have nothing paid them but the\r\ncommon returns of the worst parts of human infirmity. And therefore I\r\nshall show your Lordships that the Company did provide large, ample,\r\nabundant means for supporting the Governor-General,--that Lord Clive, in\r\nthe year 1765, and the Council with him, of which Mr. Sumner, I am glad\r\nand proud to say, was one, did fix such an allowance as they thought a\r\nsufficient security to the Governor-General against the temptations\r\nattendant upon his situation; and therefore, after they had fixed this\r\nsum, they say, \"that, although by this means the Governor will not be\r\nable to amass a million or half a million in the space of two or three\r\nyears, yet he will acquire a very handsome independency, and be in that\r\nvery situation which a man of honor and true zeal for the service would\r\nwish to possess. Thus situated, he may defy all opposition in Council;\r\nhe will have nothing to ask, nothing to propose, but what he wishes for\r\nthe advantage of his employers; he may defy the law, because there can\r\nbe no foundation for a bill of discovery; and he may defy the obloquy of\r\nthe world, because there can be nothing censurable in his conduct. In\r\nshort, if stability can be insured to such a government as this, where\r\nriches have been acquired in abundance in a small space of time, by all\r\nways and means, and by men with or without capacities, it must be\r\neffected by a Governor thus restricted,\"--that is, a Governor restricted\r\nfrom every emolument but that of his salary. I must remark, that this\r\nsalary and these emoluments were not settled upon the vague speculations\r\nof men taking the measure of their necessities for India from the\r\nmanners of England; but it was fixed by the Council themselves,--fixed\r\nin India,--fixed by those who knew and were in the situation of the\r\nGovernor-General, and who knew what was necessary to support his dignity\r\nand to preserve him from the temptation of corruption: and they have\r\nlaid open to you such a body of advantages arising from it as would lead\r\nany man, who had a regard to his honor or conscience, to think himself\r\nhappy in having such a provision made for him, and at the same time\r\nevery temptation to act corruptly removed far from him.\r\n\r\nThe emoluments of the office, though reduced from the original plan\r\nwhich Lord Clive had proposed, may be computed at near 30,000_l._ a\r\nyear, when Mr. Hastings was President: 22,000_l._ in certain money, and\r\nthe rest in other advantages. Whatever it was, I have shown that it was\r\nthought sufficient by those who were the best judges, and who, in\r\ncarving for others, were carving for themselves their own allowance at\r\nthe time. But, my Lords, I am to give a better opinion of the\r\nsufficiency of that provision to guard against the temptation, out of\r\nMr. Hastings's own mouth. He says, in his letter to the Court of\r\nDirectors, \"Although I disclaim the consideration of my own interest in\r\nthese speculations, and flatter myself that I proceed upon more liberal\r\ngrounds, yet I am proud to avow the feelings of an honest ambition that\r\nstimulates me to aspire at the possession of my present station for\r\nyears to come. Those who know my natural turn of mind will not ascribe\r\nthis to sordid views. A very few years' possession of the government\r\nwould undoubtedly enable me to retire with a fortune amply fitted to the\r\nmeasure of my desires, were I to consult only my ease: but in my present\r\nsituation I feel my mind expand to something greater; I have catched the\r\ndesire of applause in public life.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Hastings confesses that the emoluments affixed to office were\r\nnot only sufficient for the purposes and ends which the nature of his\r\noffice demanded, and the support of present dignity, but that they were\r\nsufficient to secure him, in a very few years, a comfortable retreat;\r\nbut his object in wishing to hold his office long was _to catch applause\r\nin public life_. What an unfortunate man is he, who has so often told\r\nus, in so many places, and through so many mouths, that, after fourteen\r\nyears' possession of an office which was to make him a comfortable\r\nfortune in a few years, he is at length bankrupt in fortune, and for his\r\napplause in public life is now at your Lordships' bar, and his accuser\r\nis his country! This, my Lords, is to be unfortunate: but there are some\r\nmisfortunes that never do or ever can arrive but through crimes. He was\r\na deserter from the path of honor. At the turning of the two ways he\r\nmade a glorious choice,--he caught at the applause of ambition: which\r\nthough I am ready to consent is not virtue, yet surely a generous\r\nambition for applause for public services in life is one of the best\r\ncounterfeits of virtue, and supplies its place in some degree; and it\r\nadds a lustre to real virtue, where it exists as the substratum of it.\r\nHuman nature, while it is made as it is, never can wholly repudiate it\r\nfor its imperfection, because there is something yet more perfect. But\r\nwhat shall we say to the deserter of that cause, who, having glory and\r\nhonor before him, has chosen to plunge himself into the downward road to\r\nsordid riches?\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have shown the grievances that existed. I have shown the\r\nmeans that existed to put Mr. Hastings beyond a temptation to those\r\npractices of which we accuse him, even in his own opinion,--if he will\r\nnot follow his example in the House of Commons, and disavow this letter,\r\nas he has done his defence before them, and say he never wrote it. That\r\nsituation which was to afford him a comfortable fortune in a few years\r\nhe has held for many years, and therefore he has not one excuse to make\r\nfor himself; but I shall show your Lordships much greater and stronger\r\nproofs, that will lean heavy upon him in the day of your sentence. The\r\nfirst, the peculiar, trust that was put in him, was to redress all those\r\ngrievances.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have stated to you the condition of India in 1765. You may\r\nsuppose that the means that were taken, the regulations that were made\r\nby the Company at that period of time, had operated their effect, and\r\nthat by the beginning of the year 1772, when Mr. Hastings came first to\r\nhis government, these evils did not then require, perhaps, so vigorous\r\nan example, or so much diligence in putting an end to them; but, my\r\nLords, I have to show you a very melancholy truth, that, notwithstanding\r\nall these means, the Company was of opinion that all these disorders had\r\nincreased, and accordingly they say, without entering into all the\r\ngrievous circumstances of this letter, which was wrote on the 10th of\r\nApril, 1773, \"We wish we could refute the observation, that almost every\r\nattempt made by us and our administration at your Presidency for\r\nreforming abuses has rather increased them, and added to the misery of a\r\ncountry we are so anxious to protect and cherish.\" They say, that, \"when\r\noppression pervades the whole country, when youths have been suffered\r\nwith impunity to exercise sovereign jurisdiction over the natives, and\r\nto acquire rapid fortunes by monopolizing of commerce, it cannot be a\r\nwonder to us or yourselves that Dadney merchants do not come forward to\r\ncontract with the Company, that the manufactures find their way through\r\nforeign channels, or that our investments are at once enormously dear\r\nand of a debased quality. It is evident, then, that the evils which have\r\nbeen so destructive to us lie too deep for any partial plans to reach or\r\ncorrect; it is therefore our resolution to aim at the root of those\r\nevils, and we are happy in having reason to believe that in every just\r\nand necessary regulation we shall meet with the approbation and support\r\nof the legislature, who consider the public as materially interested in\r\nthe Company's prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nThis is to show your Lordships that Mr. Hastings was armed with great\r\npowers to correct great abuses, and that there was reposed in him a\r\nspecial trust for that purpose. And now I shall show, by the\r\ntwenty-fifth paragraph of the same letter, that they intrusted Mr.\r\nHastings with this very great power from some particular hope they had,\r\nnot only of his abstaining himself, which is a thing taken for granted,\r\nbut of his restraining abuses through every part of the service; and\r\ntherefore they say, \"that, in order to effectuate this great end, the\r\nfirst step must be to restore perfect obedience and due subordination to\r\nyour administration. Our Governor and Council must reassume and exercise\r\ntheir delegated powers upon every just occasion,--punish delinquents,\r\ncherish the meritorious, discountenance that luxury and dissipation\r\nwhich, to the reproach of government, prevailed in Bengal. Our\r\nPresident, Mr. Hastings, we trust, will set the example of temperance,\r\neconomy, and application; and upon this, we are sensible, much will\r\ndepend. And here we take occasion to indulge the pleasure we have in\r\nacknowledging Mr. Hastings's services upon the coast of Coromandel, in\r\nconstructing with equal labor and ability the plan which has so much\r\nimproved our investments there; and as we are persuaded he will\r\npersevere in the same laudable pursuit through every branch of our\r\naffairs in Bengal, he, in return, may depend on the steady support and\r\nfavor of his employers.\" Here are not only laws to restrain abuse, here\r\nare not only salaries to prevent the temptation to it, but here are\r\npraises to animate and encourage him, here is what very few men, even\r\nbad in other respects, have resisted,--here is a great trust put in him,\r\nto call upon him with particular vigor and exertion to prevent all\r\nabuses through the settlement, and particularly these abuses of\r\ncorruption. Much trust is put in his frugality, his order, his\r\nmanagement of his private affairs; and from thence they hope that he\r\nwould not ruin his own fortune, but improve it by honorable means, and\r\nteach the Company's servants the same order and management, in order to\r\nfree them from temptation to rapacity in their own particular\r\nsituations. There have been known to be men, otherwise corrupt and\r\nvicious, who, when great trust was put in them, have called forth\r\nprinciples of honor latent in their minds; and men who were nursed, in a\r\nmanner, in corruption have been not only great reformers by institution,\r\nbut greater reformers by the example of their own conduct. Then I am to\r\nshow, that, soon after his coming to that government, there were means\r\ngiven him instantly of realizing those hopes and expectations, by\r\nputting into his hands several arduous and several difficult\r\ncommissions.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, in the year 1772 the Company had received alarming advices of\r\nmany disorders throughout the country: there were likewise, at the same\r\ntime, circumstances in the state of the government upon which they\r\nthought it necessary to make new regulations. The famine which prevailed\r\nin and devastated Bengal, and the ill use that was made of that calamity\r\nto aggravate the distress for the advantage of individuals, produced a\r\ngreat many complaints, some true, some exaggerated, but universally\r\nspread, as I believe is in the memory of those who are not very young\r\namong us. This obliged the Company to a very serious consideration of an\r\naffair which dishonored and disgraced their government, not only at\r\nhome, but through all the countries in Europe, much more than perhaps\r\neven more grievous and real oppressions that were exercised under them.\r\nIt had alarmed their feelings, it had been marked, and had called the\r\nattention of the public upon them in an eminent manner.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships remember the death of Jaffier Ali Khân, the first of\r\nthose subahs who introduced the English power into Bengal. He died about\r\nfour or five years before this period. He was succeeded by two of his\r\nsons, who succeeded to one another in a very rapid succession. The first\r\nwas the person of whom we have read an account to you. He was the\r\nnatural son of the Nabob by a person called Munny Begum, who, for the\r\ncorrupt gifts the circumstances of which we have recited, had, in\r\nprejudice of the lawful issue of the Nabob, been raised to the _musnud_;\r\nbut as bastard slips, it is said in King Richard, (an abuse of a\r\nScripture phrase,) do not take deep root, this bastard slip, Nujim ul\r\nDowlah, shortly died, and the legitimate son, Syef ul Dowlah, succeeded\r\nhim. After him another legitimate son, Mobarek ul Dowlah, succeeded in a\r\nminority. When I say _succeeded_, I wish your Lordships to understand\r\nthat there is no regular succession in the office of subah or viceroy\r\nof the kingdom; but, in general, succession has been considered, and\r\npersons have been put in that place upon some principles resembling a\r\nregular succession. That regular succession had been broken in favor of\r\na natural son, and the mother of that natural son did obtain the\r\nsuperiority in the female part of the family for a time.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these two circumstances, namely, the famine, and the\r\nabuses that were supposed to arise from it, and from the circumstance of\r\nthe minority of Mobarek ul Dowlah, who now reigns or appears to\r\nreign,--in consequence of these two circumstances, the Company gave two\r\nsets of orders.\r\n\r\nThe first order related to Mahomed Reza Khân, who was (as your Lordships\r\nremember I took, in the beginning of this affair, means of explaining)\r\nlord-deputy of the province under the native government, the English\r\nholding the dewanny,--and deputy dewan, or high-steward, under the name\r\nof the English, and had the command of the whole revenue; and who was\r\naccused before the Company (the channel of which accusation we now\r\nlearn) of having aggravated that famine by a monopoly for his own\r\nbenefit. The Company, upon these loose and general charges, ordered that\r\nhe should be divested of his office, that he should be brought down to\r\nCalcutta, and there be obliged to render an account of his conduct.\r\n\r\nThe next regulation they made was concerning the effective government of\r\nthe country, which was become vacant by the removal of Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân. The offices which he held were in effect these: he was guardian to\r\nthe Nabob by the appointment of the Company; he had the care and\r\nmanagement of his family; he had the care of the public justice; and he\r\nrepresented that shadow of government to foreign nations which it was\r\nthe policy of the Company, at that time, to keep up. This was the person\r\nwhom Mr. Hastings was ordered to remove; in consequence of which removal\r\nall these offices were to be supplied,--of guardian of the Nabob's\r\nperson and manager of his family, of chief magistrate, and of\r\nrepresentative of the fallen dignity of the native government to the\r\nforeign nations which traded to Bengal.\r\n\r\nTo these orders was added an instruction of a very remarkable nature,\r\nwhich was a third trust that was given to Mr. Hastings: that during the\r\nNabob's minority he should reduce the annual allowance, which was\r\nthirty-two lacs, to sixteen; and that to prevent the abuse of this\r\nrestricted sum, and to prevent its being directed by the minister's\r\nauthority to other purposes than that for which the Company allowed it,\r\n(that is to say, allowed him out of what was his own,) of these sixteen\r\nlacs an account was to be regularly kept, as a check upon the person so\r\nappointed, which account was ordered to be transmitted to Calcutta, and\r\nto be sent to England.\r\n\r\nNow we are to show your Lordships what Mr. Hastings's conduct was upon\r\nall these occasions; and for this we mean to produce testimony recorded\r\nin the Company's books, and authentic documents taken from the public\r\noffices of that country. At the same time I do admit that there never\r\nwas a positive testimony that did not stand something in need of the\r\nsupport of presumption: for, as we know that witnesses may be perjured,\r\nand as we know that documents can be forged, we have recourse to a known\r\nprinciple in the laws of all countries, that circumstances cannot lie;\r\nand therefore, if the testimony that is given was ever so clear and\r\npositive, yet, if it is contrary to the circumstances of the country, if\r\nit is contrary to the circumstances of the facts to which it alludes, if\r\nthe deposition is totally adverse and alien to the characters of the\r\npersons, then I will say, that, though the testimonies should be many,\r\nthough they should be consistent, and though they should be clear, yet\r\nthey will still leave some degree of hesitation and doubt upon every\r\nmind timorous in the execution of justice, as every mind ought to be.\r\nIf, for instance, ten witnesses were to swear that the Chief-Justice of\r\nEngland, that the Lord High-Chancellor, or the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nwas seen, in the robes of his function, at noonday, robbing upon the\r\nhighway, it is not the clearness, the weight, the authority of\r\ntestimonies, that could make me believe it; I should attribute it to any\r\ncause, either corruption, mistake, error, or madness, rather than\r\nbelieve that fact. Why? Because it is totally alien to the character of\r\nthe persons, the situation, the circumstances, and to all the rules of\r\nprobability. But if, on the contrary, the crime charged has a perfect\r\nrelation with the person, with his known conduct, with his known habits,\r\nwith the situation and circumstances of the place that he is in, and\r\nwith the very corrupt inherent nature of the act that he does, then much\r\nless proof than we are able to produce will serve; and according to the\r\nnature and strength of the presumptions arising from the inherent nature\r\nof a vicious principle and vicious motives in the act, will be\r\nstrengthened the weakest evidence, or, if it comes to a sufficient\r\nheight, the whole burden of proof will be turned upon the party\r\naccused. And thus we shall think ourselves bound to show your Lordships,\r\nin every step of this proceeding, that there is an inherent presumption\r\nof corruption in every act. We shall show the presumptions which\r\npreceded, we shall show the presumptions which accompanied the proof;\r\nand these, with the subsequent presumptions, will make it impossible to\r\ndisbelieve them. Such a body of proof was never given upon any such\r\noccasion: and it is such proof as will prevail against the whole voice\r\nof corruption, that amazing, active, diligent, spreading voice, which\r\nhas been made, by buzzing in every part of this country, sometimes to\r\nsound like the public voice; it will put it to silence, by showing that\r\nyour Lordships have proceeded upon the strongest evidence, active and\r\npassive.\r\n\r\nFirst, Mr. Hastings received a positive order to seize upon Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân. That order he executed with a military promptitude of obedience,\r\nwhich will show your Lordships what are the services which are congenial\r\nto his own mind, and which find in him always a ready acquiescence, a\r\nfaithful agent, and a spirited instrument in the execution. The very day\r\nafter he received the order, he sent up, privately, without\r\ncommunicating with the Council, from whom he was not ordered to keep\r\nthis proceeding a secret,--he sent up, and found that great and\r\nrespectable man and respectable magistrate, who was in all those high\r\noffices which I have stated: and if I was to compare them to\r\ncircumstances and situations in this country, I should say he had united\r\nin himself the character of First Lord of the Treasury, the character of\r\nChief-Justice, the character of Lord High-Chancellor, and the character\r\nof Archbishop of Canterbury: a man of great gravity, dignity, and\r\nauthority, and advanced in years; had once 100,000_l._ a year for the\r\nsupport of his dignity, and had at that time 50,000_l._ This man,\r\nsitting in his garden, reposing himself after the toils of his\r\nsituation, (for he was one of the most laborious men in the world,) was\r\nsuddenly arrested, and, without a moment's respite, dragged down to\r\nCalcutta, and there by Mr. Hastings (exceeding the orders of the\r\nCompany) confined near two years under a guard of soldiers. Mr. Hastings\r\nkept this great man for several months without even attempting the trial\r\nupon him. How he tried him afterwards your Lordships may probably in the\r\ncourse of this business inquire; and you will then judge, from the\r\ncircumstances of that trial, that, as he was not tried for his crime, so\r\nneither was he acquitted for his innocence;--but at present I leave him\r\nin that situation. Mr. Hastings, unknown to the Council, having executed\r\nthe orders of the Company in the last degree of rigor to this unhappy\r\nman, keeps him in that situation, without a trial, under a guard,\r\nseparated from his country, disgraced and dishonored, and by Mr.\r\nHastings's express order not suffered either to make a visit or receive\r\na visitor.\r\n\r\nThere was another commission for Mr. Hastings contained in these orders.\r\nThe Company, because they were of opinion that justice could not be\r\neasily obtained while the first situations of the country were filled\r\nwith this man's adherents, desired Mr. Hastings to displace them:\r\nleaving him a very large power, and confiding in his justice, prudence,\r\nand impartiality not to abuse a trust of such delicacy. But we shall\r\nprove to your Lordships that Mr. Hastings thought it necessary to turn\r\nout, from the highest to the lowest, several hundreds of people, for no\r\nother reason than that they had been put in their employments by that\r\nvery man whom the English government had formerly placed there. If _we_\r\nwere to insist that we could not possibly try Mr. Hastings, or come at\r\nhis wickedness, until we had eradicated his influence in Bengal, and\r\nleft not one man in it who was during his government in any place or\r\noffice whatever, yet, though we should readily admit that we could not\r\ndo the whole without it, at the same time, rather than make a general\r\nmassacre of every person presumed to be under his influence, we would\r\nleave some of his crimes unproved. He did avow and declare, that, unless\r\nhe turned all these persons out of their offices, he could never hope to\r\ncome at the truth of any charges against Mahomed Reza Khân, against whom\r\nno specific charge had been made. Yet, upon loose and general charges,\r\ndid he seize upon this man, confine him in this manner, and every person\r\nwho derived any place or authority from him, high or low, was turned\r\nout. Mr. Hastings had in the Company's orders something to justify him\r\nin rigor, but he had likewise a prudential power over that rigor; and he\r\nnot only treated this man in the manner described, but every human\r\ncreature connected with him, as if they had been all guilty, without any\r\ncharge whatever against them. These are his reasons for taking this\r\nextraordinary step.\r\n\r\n\"I pretend not to enter into the views of others. My own were these.\r\nMahomed Reza Khân's influence still prevailed generally throughout the\r\ncountry. In the Nabob's household, and at the capital, it was scarce\r\naffected by his present disgrace. His favor was still courted, and his\r\nanger dreaded. Who, under such discouragements, would give information\r\nor evidence against him? His agents and creatures filled every office of\r\nthe nizamut and dewanny. How was the truth of his conduct to be\r\ninvestigated by these? It would be superfluous to add other arguments to\r\nshow the necessity of prefacing the inquiry by breaking his influence,\r\nremoving his dependants, and putting the direction of all the affairs\r\nwhich had been committed to his care into the hands of the most powerful\r\nor active of his enemies.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, if _we_ of the House of Commons were to desire and to compel\r\nthe East India Company, or to address the crown, to remove, according to\r\ntheir several situations and several capacities, every creature that had\r\nbeen put into office by Mr. Hastings, because we could otherwise make no\r\ninquiry into his conduct, should we not be justified by his own example\r\nin insisting upon the removal of every creature of the reigning power\r\nbefore we could inquire into his conduct? We have not done that, though\r\nwe feel, as he felt, great disadvantages in proceeding in the inquiry\r\nwhile every situation in Bengal is notoriously held by his\r\ncreatures,--always excepting the first of all, but which we could show\r\nis nothing under such circumstances. Then what do I infer from\r\nthis,--from his obedience to the orders of the Company, carried so much\r\nbeyond necessity, and prosecuted with so much rigor,--from the inquiry\r\nbeing suspended for so long a time,--from every person in office being\r\nremoved from his situation,--from all these precautions being used as\r\nprefatory to the inquiry, when he himself says, that, after he had used\r\nall these means, he found not the least benefit and advantage from them?\r\nThe use I mean to make of this is, to let your Lordships see the great\r\nprobability and presumption that Mr. Hastings, finding himself in the\r\nvery selfsame situation that had occurred the year before, when\r\nNundcomar was sold to Mahomed Reza Khân, of selling Mahomed Reza Khân to\r\nNundcomar, made a corrupt use of it, and that, as Mahomed Reza Khân was\r\nnot treated with severity for his crimes, so neither was he acquitted\r\nfor his innocence. The Company had given Mr. Hastings severe orders, and\r\nvery severely had he executed them. The Company gave him no orders not\r\nto institute a present inquiry; but he, under pretence of business,\r\nneglected that inquiry, and suffered this man to languish in prison to\r\nthe utter ruin of his fortune.\r\n\r\nWe have in part shown your Lordships what Mr. Hastings's own manner of\r\nproceeding with regard to a public delinquent is; but at present we\r\nleave Mahomed Reza Khân where he was. Do your Lordships think that there\r\nis no presumption of Mr. Hastings having a corrupt view in this\r\nbusiness, and of his having put this great man, who was supposed to be\r\nof immense wealth, under contributions? Mr. Hastings never trusted his\r\ncolleagues in this proceeding; and what reason does he give? Why, he\r\nsupposed that they must be bribed by Mahomed Reza Khân. \"For,\" says he,\r\n\"as I did not know their characters at that time, I did not know whether\r\nMahomed Reza Khân had not secured them to his interest by the known ways\r\nin which great men in the East secure men to their interest.\" He never\r\ntrusted his colleagues with the secret; and the person that he employed\r\nto prosecute Mahomed Reza Khân was his bitter enemy, Nundcomar. I will\r\nnot go the length of saying that the circumstance of enmity disables a\r\nperson from being a prosecutor; under some circumstances it renders a\r\nman incompetent to be a witness; but this I know, that the circumstance\r\nof having no other person to rely upon in a charge against any man but\r\nhis enemy, and of having no other principle to go upon than what is\r\nsupposed to be derived out of that enmity, must form some considerable\r\nsuspicion against the proceeding. But in this he was justified by the\r\nCompany; for Nundcomar, the great rival of Mahomed Reza Khân, was in the\r\nworst situation with the Company as to his credit. This Nundcomar's\r\npolitics in the country had been by Mr. Hastings himself, and by several\r\npersons joined with him, cruelly represented to the Company; and\r\naccordingly he stood so ill with them, by reason of Mr. Hastings's\r\nrepresentations and those of his predecessors, that the Company ordered\r\nand directed, that, if he could be of any use in the inquiry into\r\nMahomed Reza Khân's conduct, some reward should be given him suitable to\r\nhis services; but they caution Mr. Hastings at the same time against\r\ngiving him any trust which he might employ to the disadvantage of the\r\nCompany. Now Mr. Hastings began, before he could experience any service\r\nfrom him, by giving him his reward, and not the base reward of a base\r\nservice, _money_, but every trust and power which he was prohibited from\r\ngiving him. Having turned out every one of Mahomed Reza Khân's\r\ndependants, he filled every office, as he avows, with the creatures of\r\nNundcomar. Now when he uses a cruel and rigorous obedience in the case\r\nof Mahomed Reza Khân, when he breaks through the principles of his\r\nformer conduct with regard to Nundcomar, when he gives _him_, Nundcomar,\r\ntrust, whom he was cautioned not to trust, and when he gives him that\r\nreward before any service could be done,--I say, when he does this, in\r\nviolation of the Company's orders and his own principles, it is the\r\nstrongest evidence that he now found them in the situation in which they\r\nwere in 1765, when bribes were notoriously taken, and that each party\r\nwas mutually sold to the other, and faith kept with neither. The\r\nsituation in which Mr. Hastings thus placed himself should have been\r\ndreaded by him of all things, because he knew it was a situation in\r\nwhich the most outrageous corruption had taken place before.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance which serves to show that in the\r\npersecution of these great men, and the persons employed by them, he\r\ncould have no other view than to extort money from them. There was a\r\nperson of the name of Shitab Roy, who had a great share in the conduct\r\nof the revenues of Bahar. Mr. Hastings, in the letter to the Company,\r\ncomplaining of the state of their affairs, and saying that there were\r\ngreat and suspicious balances in the kingdom of Bahar, does not even\r\nname the name of Shitab Roy. There was an English counsellor, a\r\nparticular friend of Mr. Hastings's, there, under whose control Shitab\r\nRoy acted. Without any charges, without any orders from the Company, Mr.\r\nHastings dragged down that same Shitab Roy, and in the same ignominious\r\nprison he kept him the same length of time, that is, one year and three\r\nmonths, without trial; and when the trial came on, there was as much\r\nappearance of collusion in the trial as there was of rigor in the\r\nprevious process. This is the manner in which Mr. Hastings executed the\r\ncommand of the Company for removing Mahomed Reza Khân.\r\n\r\nWhen a successor to Mahomed Reza Khân was to be appointed, your\r\nLordships naturally expect, from the character I have given of him, and\r\nfrom the nature of his functions, that Mr. Hastings would be\r\nparticularly precise, would use the utmost possible care in nominating a\r\nperson to succeed him, who might fulfil the ends and objects of his\r\nemployment, and be at the same time beyond all doubt and suspicion of\r\ncorruption in any way whatever. Let us now see how he fills up that\r\noffice thus vacant. When the Company ordered Mahomed Reza Khân to be\r\ndispossessed of his office, they ordered at the same time that the\r\nsalary of his successor should be reduced: that 30,000_l._ was a\r\nsufficient recompense for that office. Your Lordships will see by the\r\nallowance for the office, even reduced as it was, that they expected\r\nsome man of great eminence, of great consequence, and fit for those\r\ngreat and various trusts. They cut off the dewanny from it, that is, the\r\ncollection of the revenues; and having lessened his labors, they\r\nlessened his reward.--They ordered that this person, who was to be\r\nguardian of the Nabob in his minority, and who was to represent the\r\ngovernment, should have but 30,000_l._ The order they give is this.\r\n\r\n\"And that as Mahomed Reza Khân can no longer be considered by us as one\r\nto whom such a power can safely be committed, we trust to your local\r\nknowledge the selection of some person well qualified for the affairs of\r\ngovernment, and of whose attachment to the Company you shall be well\r\nassured. Such person you will recommend to the Nabob, to succeed Mahomed\r\nReza, as minister of the government, and guardian of the Nabob's\r\nminority; and we persuade ourselves that the Nabob will pay such regard\r\nto your recommendation as to invest him with the necessary power and\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n\"As the advantages which the Company may receive from the appointment of\r\nsuch minister will depend on his readiness to promote our views and\r\nadvance our interest, we are willing to allow him so liberal a\r\ngratification as may excite his zeal and insure his attachment to the\r\nCompany; we therefore empower you to grant to the person whom you shall\r\nthink worthy of this trust an annual allowance not exceeding three lacs\r\nof rupees, which we consider not only as a munificent reward for any\r\nservices he shall render the Company, but sufficient to enable him to\r\nsupport his station with suitable rank and dignity. And here we must\r\nadd, that, in the choice you shall make of a person to be the active\r\nminister of the Nabob's government, we hope and trust that you will show\r\nyourselves worthy of the confidence we have placed in you by being\r\nactuated therein by no other motives than those of the public good and\r\nthe safety and interest of the Company.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here they have given a reward, and they have described a\r\nperson fit to succeed in all capacities the man whom they had thought\r\nfit to depose. Now, as we have seen how Mr. Hastings obeyed the\r\nCompany's orders in the manner of removing Mahomed Reza Khân from his\r\noffice, let us see how he obeyed their order for filling it up. Your\r\nLordships will naturally suppose that he made all the orders of\r\nMahometan and Hindoo princes to pass in strict review before him; that\r\nhe had considered their age, authority, dignity, the goodness of their\r\nmanners; and upon the collation of all these circumstances had chosen a\r\nperson fit to be a regent to guard the Nabob's minority from all\r\nrapacity whatever, and fit to instruct him in everything. I will give\r\nyour Lordships Mr. Hastings's own idea of the person necessary to fill\r\nsuch offices.\r\n\r\n\"That his rank ought to be such as at least ought not to wound the\r\nNabob's honor, or lessen his credit in the estimation of the people, by\r\nthe magisterial command which the new guardian must exercise over\r\nhim,--with abilities and vigor of mind equal to the support of that\r\nauthority; and the world will expect that the guardian be especially\r\nqualified by his own acquired endowments to discharge the duties of that\r\nrelation in the education of his young pupil, to inspire him with\r\nsentiments suitable to his birth, and to instruct him in the principles\r\nof his religion.\"\r\n\r\nThis, upon another occasion, is Mr. Hastings's sense of the man who\r\nought to be placed in that situation of trust in which the Company\r\nordered him to place him. Did Mr. Hastings obey that order? No, my\r\nLords, he appointed no man to fill that office. What, no man at all? No,\r\nhe appointed no person at all in the sense which is mentioned there,\r\nwhich constantly describes a person at least of the male sex: he\r\nappointed a woman to fill that office; he appointed a woman, in a\r\ncountry where no woman can be seen, where no woman can be spoken to by\r\nany one without a curtain between them; for all these various duties,\r\nrequiring all these qualifications described by himself, he appointed a\r\nwoman. Do you want more proof than this violent transgression of the\r\nCompany's orders upon that occasion that some corrupt motive must have\r\ninfluenced him?\r\n\r\nMy Lords, it is necessary for me to state the situation of the family,\r\nthat you may judge from thence of the corrupt motives of Mr. Hastings's\r\nproceedings. The Nabob Jaffier Ali Khân had among the women of his\r\nseraglio a person called Munny Begum. She was a dancing-girl, whom he\r\nhad seen at some entertainment; and as he was of a licentious turn, this\r\ndancing-girl, in the course of her profession as a prostitute, so far\r\ninveigled the Nabob, that, having a child or pretending to have had a\r\nchild by him, he brought her into the seraglio; and the Company's\r\nservants sold to that son the succession of that father. This woman had\r\nbeen sold as a slave,--her profession a dancer, her occupation a\r\nprostitute. And, my Lords, this woman having put her natural son, as we\r\nstate, and shall prove, in the place of the legitimate offspring of the\r\nNabob, having got him placed by the Company's servants on the musnud,\r\nshe came to be at the head of that part of the household which relates\r\nto the women: which is a large and considerable trust in a country where\r\npolygamy is admitted, and where women of great rank may possibly be\r\nattended by two thousand of the same sex in inferior situations. As soon\r\nas the legitimate son of the Nabob came to the musnud, there was no\r\nground for keeping this woman any longer in that situation; and upon an\r\napplication of the Company to Mahomed Reza Khân to know who ought to\r\nhave the right of superiority, he answered, as he ought to have done,\r\nthat, though all the women of the seraglio ought to have honor, yet the\r\nmother of the Nabob ought to have the superiority of it. Therefore this\r\nwoman was removed, and the mother of the Nabob was placed in her\r\nsituation. In that situation Mr. Hastings found the seraglio. If his\r\nduties had gone no further than the regulation of an Eastern household,\r\nhe ought to have kept the Nabob's mother there by the rules of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhat did he do? Not satisfied with giving to this prostitute every favor\r\nthat she could desire, (and money must be the natural object of such a\r\nperson,) Mr. Hastings deposes the Nabob's own mother, turns her out of\r\nthe employment, and puts at the head of the seraglio this prostitute,\r\nwho at the best, in relation to him, could only be a step-mother. If you\r\nheard no more, do your Lordships want anything further to convince you\r\nthat this must be a violent, atrocious, and corrupt act,--suppose it had\r\ngone no further than the seraglio? But when I call this woman a\r\ndancing-girl, I state something lower than Europeans have an idea of\r\nrespecting that situation. She was born a slave, bred a dancing-girl.\r\nHer dancing was not any of those noble and majestic movements which make\r\npart of the entertainment of the most wise, of the education of the most\r\nvirtuous, which improve the manners without corrupting the morals of all\r\ncivilized people, and of which, among uncivilized people, the professors\r\nhave their due share of admiration; but these dances were not decent to\r\nbe seen nor fit to be related. I shall pass them by. Your Lordships are\r\nto suppose the lowest degree of infamy in occupation and situation, when\r\nI tell you that Munny Begum was a slave and a dancing-girl.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Munny Begum is this. \"At a village called Balkonda,\r\nnear Sekundra, there lived a widow, who, from her great poverty, not\r\nbeing able to bring up her daughter Munny, gave her to a slave-girl\r\nbelonging to Summin Ali Khân, whose name was Bissoo. During the space of\r\nfive years she lived at Shahjehanabad, and was educated by Bissoo after\r\nthe manner of a dancing-girl. Afterwards the Nabob Shamut Jung, upon\r\nthe marriage of Ikram ul Dowlah, brother to the Nabob Surajah ul Dowlah,\r\nsent for Bissoo Beg's set of dancing-girls from Shahjehanabad, of which\r\nMunny Begum was one, and allowed them ten thousand rupees for their\r\nexpenses, to dance at the wedding. While the ceremony was celebrating,\r\nthey were kept by the Nabob; but some months afterwards he dismissed\r\nthem, and they took up their residence in this city. Mir Mahomed Jaffier\r\nKhân then took them into keeping, and allowed Munny and her set five\r\nhundred rupees per month, till at length, finding that Munny was\r\npregnant, he took her into his own house. She gave birth to the Nabob\r\nNujim ul Dowlah, and in this manner has she remained in the Nabob's\r\nfamily ever since.\"\r\n\r\nNow it required a very peculiar mode of selection to take such a woman,\r\nso circumstanced, (resembling whom there was not just such another,) to\r\ndepose the Nabob's own mother from the superiority of the household, and\r\nto substitute this woman. It would have been an abominable abuse, and\r\nwould have implied corruption in the grossest degree, if Mr. Hastings\r\nhad stopped there. He not only did this, but he put _her_, this woman,\r\nin the very place of Mahomed Reza Khân: he made her guardian, he made\r\nher regent, he made her viceroy, he made her the representative of the\r\nnative government of the country in the eyes of strangers. There was not\r\na trust, not a dignity in the country, which he did not put, during the\r\nminority of this unhappy person, her step-son, into the hands of this\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nReject, if you please, the strong presumption of corruption in\r\ndisobeying the order of the Company directing him to select a _man_ fit\r\nto supply the place of Mahomed Reza Khân, to exercise all the great and\r\narduous functions of government and of justice, as well as the\r\nregulation of the Nabob's household; and then I will venture to say,\r\nthat neither your Lordships, nor any man living, when he hears of this\r\nappointment, does or can hesitate a moment in concluding that it is the\r\nresult of corruption, and that you only want to be informed what the\r\ncorruption was. Here is such an arrangement as I believe never was\r\nbefore heard of: a secluded woman in the place of a man of the world; a\r\nfantastic dancing-girl in the place of a grave magistrate; a slave in\r\nthe place of a woman of quality; a common prostitute made to superintend\r\nthe education of a young prince; and a step-mother, a name of horror in\r\nall countries, made to supersede the natural mother from whose body the\r\nNabob had sprung.\r\n\r\nThese are circumstances that leave no doubt of the grossest and most\r\nflagrant corruption. But was there no application made to Mr. Hastings\r\nupon that occasion? The Nabob's uncle, whom Mr. Hastings declares to be\r\na man of no dangerous ambition, no alarming parts, no one quality that\r\ncould possibly exclude him from that situation, makes an application to\r\nMr. Hastings for that place, and was by Mr. Hastings rejected. The\r\nreason he gives for his rejection is, because he cannot put any man in\r\nit without danger to the Company, who had ordered him to put a man into\r\nit. One would imagine the trust to be placed in him was such as enabled\r\nhim to overturn the Company in a moment. Now the situation in which the\r\nNabob's uncle, Yeteram ul Dowlah, would have been placed was this: he\r\nwould have had no troops, he would have had no treasury, he would have\r\nhad no collections of revenue, nothing, in short, that could have made\r\nhim dangerous, but he would have been an absolute pensioner and\r\ndependant upon the Company, though in high office; and the least attempt\r\nto disturb the Company, instead of increasing, would have been\r\nsubversive of his own power. If Mr. Hastings should still insist that\r\nthere might be danger from the appointment of a man, we shall prove that\r\nhe was of opinion that there could be no danger from any one,--that the\r\nNabob himself was a mere shadow, a cipher, and was kept there only to\r\nsoften the English government in the eyes and opinion of the natives.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I will detail these circumstances no further, but will bring\r\nsome collateral proofs to show that Mr. Hastings was at that very time\r\nconscious of the wicked and corrupt act he was doing. For, besides this\r\nfoolish principle of policy, which he gives as a reason for defying the\r\norders of the Company, and for insulting the country, that had never\r\nbefore seen a woman in that situation, and _his_ declaration to the\r\nCompany, that their government cannot be supported by private justice,\r\n(a favorite maxim, which he holds upon all occasions,) besides these\r\nreasons which he gave for his politic injustice, he gives the following.\r\nThe Company had ordered that 30,000_l._ should be given to the person\r\nappointed. He knew that the Company could never dream of giving this\r\nwoman 30,000_l._ a year, and he makes use of that circumstance to\r\njustify him in putting her in that place: for he says, the Company, in\r\nthe distressed state of its affairs, could never mean to give 30,000_l._\r\na year for the office which they order to be filled; and accordingly,\r\nupon principles of economy, as well as upon principles of prudence, he\r\nsees there could be no occasion for giving this salary, and that it will\r\nbe saved to the Company. But no sooner had he given her the appointment\r\nthan that appointment became a ground for giving her that money. The\r\nmoment he had appointed her, he overturns the very principle upon which\r\nhe had appointed her, and gives the 30,000_l._ to her, and the officers\r\nunder her, saving not one shilling to the Company by this infamous\r\nmeasure, which he justified only upon the principle of economy. The\r\n30,000_l._ was given, the principle of economy vanished, a shocking\r\narrangement was made, and Bengal saw a dancing-girl administering its\r\njustice, presiding over all its remaining power, wealth, and influence,\r\nexhibiting to the natives of the country their miserable state of\r\ndegradation, and the miserable dishonor of the English Company in Mr.\r\nHastings's abandonment of all his own pretences.\r\n\r\nBut there is a still stronger presumption. The Company ordered that this\r\nperson, who was to have the management of the Nabob's revenue, and who\r\nwas to be his guardian, should keep a strict account, which account\r\nshould be annually transmitted to the Presidency, and by the Presidency\r\nto Europe; and the purpose of it was, to keep a control upon the reduced\r\nexpenses of the sixteen lac which were ordered in the manner I\r\nmentioned. Your Lordships will naturally imagine that that control was\r\nkept safe. No, here is the order of the Directors, and you will see how\r\nMr. Hastings obeyed it.\r\n\r\n\"As the disbursement of the sums allotted to the Nabob for the\r\nmaintenance of his household and family and the support of his dignity\r\nwill pass through the hands of the minister who shall be selected by\r\nyou, conformable to our preceding orders, we expect that you will\r\nrequire such minister to deliver annually to your board a regular and\r\nexact account of the application of the several sums paid by the Company\r\nto the Nabob. This you will strictly examine; and we trust that you will\r\nnot suffer any part of the Nabob's stipend to be appropriated to the\r\nminister's own use, or wasted among the unnecessary dependants of the\r\ncourt, but that the whole amount be applied to the purposes for which it\r\nwas assigned by us.\"\r\n\r\nOne would have imagined, that, after Mr. Hastings had made so suspicious\r\nan arrangement, (I will not call it by any worse name,) he would have\r\nremoved all suspicion with regard to money,--that he would have obeyed\r\nthe Company by constituting the control which they had ordered to be\r\nplaced over a man, even a fit man, and a man worthy of the trust\r\ncommitted to him. But what is his answer, when three years after he is\r\ndesired to produce this account? His answer is,--\"I can save the board\r\nthe trouble of this reference by acquainting them that no such accounts\r\nhave ever been transmitted, nor, as I can affirm with most certain\r\nknowledge, any orders given for that purpose, either to Gourdas, to\r\nwhose office it did not properly belong, nor to the Begum, who had the\r\nactual charge and responsibility of those disbursements.\"\r\n\r\nHe has given to this woman the charge of all the disbursements of the\r\nCompany; the officer whom you would imagine would be responsible was not\r\nresponsible, but to this prostitute and dancing-girl the whole of the\r\nrevenue was given; when he was ordered to transmit that account, he not\r\nonly did not produce that account, but had given no order that it\r\nshould be kept: so that no doubt can be left upon your Lordships' minds,\r\nthat the sixteen lac, which were reserved for the support of the dignity\r\nof the government of that country, were employed for the purpose of Mr.\r\nHastings's having a constant bank, from which he should draw every\r\ncorrupt emolument he should think fit for himself and his associates.\r\nThus your Lordships see that he appointed an improper person to the\r\ntrust without any control, and that the very accounts which were to be\r\nthe guardians of his purity, and which were to remove suspicion from\r\nhim, he never so much as directed or ordered. If any one can doubt that\r\nthat transaction was in itself corrupt, I can only say that his mind\r\nmust be constituted in a manner totally different from that which\r\nprevails in any of the higher or lower branches of judicature in any\r\ncountry in the world. The suppression of an account is a proof of\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hastings committed these acts of violence against Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân, when he proceeded to make arrangements in the Company's affairs of\r\nthe same kind with those in which corruption had been before exercised,\r\nhe was bound by a particular responsibility that there should be nothing\r\nmysterious in his own conduct, and that at least all the accounts should\r\nbe well kept. He appointed a person nominally for that\r\nsituation,--namely, the Rajah Gourdas. Who was he? A person acting, he\r\nsays, under the influence of Rajah Nundcomar, whom he had declared was\r\nnot fit to be employed or trusted: all the offices were filled by him.\r\nBut had Rajah Gourdas, whose character is that of an excellent man,\r\nagainst whom there could lie no reasonable objection on account of his\r\npersonal character, and whose want of talents was to be supplied by\r\nthose of Nundcomar, (and of _his_ parts Mr. Hastings spoke as highly as\r\npossible,)--had he, I say, the management? No: but Munny Begum. Did she\r\nkeep any accounts? No.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings was ordered, and a very disagreeable and harsh order it\r\nwas, to take away one half of the Nabob's allowance which he had by\r\ntreaty. I do not charge Mr. Hastings with this reduction: he had nothing\r\nto do with that. Sixteen lac were cut off, and sixteen left; these two\r\nsums had been distributed, one for the support of the seraglio and the\r\ndignity of the state, the other for the court establishment and the\r\nhousehold. The sixteen lac which was left, therefore, required to be\r\nwell economized, and well administered. There was a rigor in the\r\nCompany's order relative to it, which was, that it should take place\r\nfrom an antedated time, that is, a whole year prior to the communication\r\nof their order to the Nabob. The order was, that the Nabob's stipend\r\nshould be reduced to sixteen lac a year from the month of January. Mr.\r\nHastings makes this reflection upon it, in order to leave no doubt upon\r\nyour mind of his integrity in administering that great trust: he says,--\r\n\r\n\"Your order for the reduction of the Nabob's stipend was communicated to\r\nhim in the month of December, 1771. He remonstrated against it, and\r\ndesired it might be again referred to the Company. The board entirely\r\nacquiesced in his remonstrance, and the subsequent payments of his\r\nstipend were paid as before. I might easily have availed myself of this\r\nplea. I might have treated it as an act of the past government, with\r\nwhich I had no cause to interfere, and joined in asserting the\r\nimpossibility of his defraying the vast expense of his court and\r\nhousehold without it, which I could have proved by plausible arguments,\r\ndrawn from the actual amount of the nizamut and bhela establishments;\r\nand both the Nabob and Begum would have liberally purchased my\r\nforbearance. Instead of pursuing this plan, I carried your orders\r\nrigidly and literally into execution. I undertook myself the laborious\r\nand reproachful task of limiting his charges, from an excess of his\r\nformer stipend, to the sum of his reduced allowance.\"\r\n\r\nHe says in another place,--\"The stoppage of the king's tribute was an\r\nact of mine, and I have been often reproached with it. It was certainly\r\nin my power to have continued the payment of it, and to have made my\r\nterms with the king for any part of it which I might have chosen to\r\nreserve for my own use. He would have thanked me for the remainder.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I believe it is a singular thing, and what your Lordships have\r\nbeen very little used to, to see a man in the situation of Mr. Hastings,\r\nor in any situation like it, so ready in knowing all the resources by\r\nwhich sinister emolument may be made and concealed, and which, under\r\npretences of public good, may be transferred into the pocket of him who\r\nuses those pretences. He is resolved, if he is innocent, that his\r\ninnocence shall not proceed from ignorance. He well knows the ways of\r\nfalsifying the Company's accounts; he well knows the necessities of the\r\nnatives, and he knows that by paying a part of their dues they will be\r\nready to give an acquittance of the whole. These are parts of Mr.\r\nHastings's knowledge of which your Lordships will see he also well\r\nknows how to avail himself.\r\n\r\nBut you would expect, when he reduced the allowance to sixteen lac, and\r\ntook credit to himself as if he had done the thing which he professed,\r\nand had argued from his rigor and cruelty his strict and literal\r\nobedience to the Company, that he had in reality done it. The very\r\nreverse: for it will be in proof, that, after he had pretended to reduce\r\nthe Company's allowance, he continued it a twelvemonth from the day in\r\nwhich he said he had entirely executed it, to the amount of 90,000_l._,\r\nand entered a false account of the suppression in the Company's\r\naccounts; and when he has taken a credit as under pretence of reducing\r\nthat allowance, he paid 90,000_l._ more than he ought. Can you, then,\r\nhave a doubt, after all these false pretences, after all this fraud,\r\nfabrication, and suppression which he made use of, that that 90,000_l._,\r\nof which he kept no account and transmitted no account, was money given\r\nto himself for his own private use and advantage?\r\n\r\nThis is all that I think necessary to state to your Lordships upon this\r\nmonstrous part of the arrangement; and therefore, from his rigorous\r\nobedience in cases of cruelty, and, where control was directed, from his\r\ntotal disobedience, and from his choice of persons, from his suppression\r\nof the accounts that ought to have been produced, and falsifying the\r\naccounts that were kept, there arises a strong inference of corruption.\r\nWhen your Lordships see all this in proof, your Lordships will justify\r\nme in saying that there never was (taking every part of the arrangement)\r\nsuch a direct, open violation of any trust.--I shall say no more with\r\nregard to the appointment of Munny Begum.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here ended the first scene, and here ends that body of\r\npresumption arising from the transaction and inherent in it. My Lords,\r\nthe next scene that I am to bring before you is the positive proof of\r\ncorruption in this transaction, in which I am sure you already see that\r\ncorruption must exist. The charge was brought by a person in the highest\r\ntrust and confidence with Mr. Hastings, a person employed in the\r\nmanagement of the whole transaction, a person to whom the management,\r\nsubordinate to Munny Begum, of all the pecuniary transactions, and all\r\nthe arrangements made upon that occasion, was intrusted.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th day of March, 1775, Nundcomar gives to Mr. Francis, a member\r\nof the Council, a charge against Mr. Hastings, consisting of two parts.\r\nThe first of these charges was a vast number of corrupt dealings, with\r\nrespect to which he was the informer, not the witness, but to which he\r\nindicated the modes of inquiry; and they are corrupt dealings, as Mr.\r\nHastings himself states them, amounting to millions of rupees, and in\r\ntransactions every one of which implies in it the strongest degree of\r\ncorruption. The next part was of those to which he was not only an\r\ninformer, but a witness, in having been the person who himself\r\ntransmitted the money to Mr. Hastings and the agents of Mr. Hastings;\r\nand accordingly, upon this part, which is the only part we charge, his\r\nevidence is clear and full, that he gave the money to Mr. Hastings,--he\r\nand the Begum (for I put them together). He states, that Mr. Hastings\r\nreceived for the appointment of Munny Begum to the rajahship two lacs of\r\nrupees, or about 22,000_l._, and that he received in another gross sum\r\none lac and a half of rupees: in all making three lac and a half, or\r\nabout 36,000_l._ This charge was signed by the man, and accompanied with\r\nthe account.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, on that day, made no reflection or observation whatever\r\nupon this charge, except that he attempted to excite some suspicion that\r\nMr. Francis, who had produced it, was concerned in the charge, and was\r\nthe principal mover in it. He asks Mr. Francis that day this question:--\r\n\r\n\"The Governor-General observes, as Mr. Francis has been pleased to\r\ninform the board that he was unacquainted with the contents of the\r\nletter sent in to the board by Nundcomar, that he thinks himself\r\njustified in carrying his curiosity further than he should have\r\npermitted himself without such a previous intimation, and therefore begs\r\nleave to ask Mr. Francis whether he was before this acquainted with\r\nNundcomar's intention of bringing such charges against him before the\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n\"_Mr. Francis._--As a member of this Council, I do not deem myself\r\nobliged to answer any question of mere curiosity. I am willing, however,\r\nto inform the Governor-General, that, though I was totally unacquainted\r\nwith the contents of the paper I have now delivered in to the board till\r\nI heard it read, I did apprehend in general that it contained some\r\ncharge against him. It was this apprehension that made me so\r\nparticularly cautious in the manner of receiving the Rajah's letter. I\r\nwas not acquainted with Rajah Nundcomar's intention of bringing in such\r\ncharges as are mentioned in the letter.\r\n\r\n    \"Warren Hastings.\r\n    J. Clavering.\r\n    Geo. Monson.\r\n    P. Francis.\"\r\n\r\nNow what the duty of Mr. Hastings and the Council was, upon receiving\r\nsuch information, I shall beg leave to state to your Lordships from the\r\nCompany's orders; but, before I read them, I must observe, that, in\r\npursuance of an act of Parliament, which was supposed to be made upon\r\naccount of the neglect of the Company, as well as the neglects of their\r\nservants, and for which general neglects responsibility was fixed upon\r\nthe Company for the future, while for the present their authority was\r\nsuspended, and a Parliamentary commission sent out to regulate their\r\naffairs, the Company did, upon that occasion, send out a general code\r\nand body of instructions to be observed by their servants, in the 35th\r\nparagraph of which it is said,--\r\n\r\n\"We direct that you immediately cause the strictest inquiry to be made\r\ninto all oppressions which may have been committed either against the\r\nnatives or Europeans, and into all abuses that may have prevailed in the\r\ncollection of the revenues, or any part of the civil government of the\r\nPresidency: and that you communicate to us all information which you may\r\nbe able to learn relative thereto, or to any dissipation or embezzlement\r\nof the Company's money.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see here that there is a direct duty fixed upon them to\r\nforward, to promote, to set on foot, without exception of any persons\r\nwhatever, an inquiry into all manner of corruption, peculation, and\r\noppression. Therefore this charge of Nundcomar's was a case exactly\r\nwithin the Company's orders; such a charge was not sought out, but was\r\nactually laid before them; but if it had not been actually laid before\r\nthem, if they had any reason to suspect that such corruptions existed,\r\nthey were bound by this order to make an active inquiry into them.\r\n\r\nUpon that day (11th March, 1775) nothing further passed; and, on the\r\npart of Mr. Hastings, that charge, as far as we can find, might have\r\nstood upon the records forever, without his making the smallest\r\nobservation upon it, or taking any one step to clear his own character.\r\nBut Nundcomar was not so inattentive to his duties as an accuser as Mr.\r\nHastings was to his duties as an inquirer; for, without a moment's\r\ndelay, upon the first board-day, two days after, Nundcomar came and\r\ndelivered the following letter.\r\n\r\n\"I had the honor to lay before you, in a letter of the 11th instant, an\r\nabstracted, but true account of the Honorable Governor in the course of\r\nhis administration. What is there written I mean not the least to alter:\r\nfar from it. I have the strongest written vouchers to produce in support\r\nof what I have advanced; and I wish and entreat, for my honor's sake,\r\nthat you will suffer me to appear before you, to establish the fact by\r\nan additional, incontestable evidence.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I will venture to say, if ever there was an accuser that\r\nappeared well and with weight before any court, it was this man. He does\r\nnot shrink from his charge; he offered to meet the person he charged\r\nface to face, and to make good his charge by his own evidence, and\r\nfurther evidence that he should produce. Your Lordships have also seen\r\nthe conduct of Mr. Hastings on the first day; you have seen his\r\nacquiescence under it; you have seen the suspicion he endeavored to\r\nraise. Now, before I proceed to what Mr. Hastings thought of it, I must\r\nremark upon this accusation, that it is a specific accusation, coming\r\nfrom a person knowing the very transaction, and known to be concerned in\r\nit,--that it was an accusation in writing, that it was an accusation\r\nwith a signature, that it was an accusation with a person to make it\r\ngood, that it was made before a competent authority, and made before an\r\nauthority bound to inquire into such accusation. When he comes to\r\nproduce his evidence, he tells you, first, the sums of money given, the\r\nspecies in which they were given, the very bags in which they were put,\r\nthe exchange that was made by reducing them to the standard money of the\r\ncountry; he names all the persons through whose hands the whole\r\ntransaction went, eight in number, besides himself, Munny Begum, and\r\nGourdas, being eleven, all referred to in this transaction. I do believe\r\nthat since the beginning of the world there never was an accusation\r\nwhich was more deserving of inquiry, because there never was an\r\naccusation which put a false accuser in a worse situation, and that put\r\nan honest defendant in a better; for there was every means of collation,\r\nevery means of comparison, every means of cross-examining, every means\r\nof control. There was every way of sifting evidence, in which evidence\r\ncould be sifted. Eleven witnesses to the transaction are referred to;\r\nall the particulars of the payment, every circumstance that could give\r\nthe person accused the advantage of showing the falsehood of the\r\naccusation, were specified. General accusations may be treated as\r\ncalumnies; but particular accusations, like these, afford the defendant,\r\nif innocent, every possible means for making his defence: therefore the\r\nvery making no defence at all would prove, beyond all doubt, a\r\nconsciousness of guilt.\r\n\r\nThe next thing for your Lordships' consideration is the conduct of Mr.\r\nHastings upon this occasion. You would imagine that he would have\r\ntreated the accusation with a cold and manly disdain; that he would\r\nhave challenged and defied inquiry, and desired to see his accuser face\r\nto face. This is what any man would do in such a situation. I can\r\nconceive very well that a man composed, firm, and collected in himself,\r\nconscious of not only integrity, but known integrity, conscious of a\r\nwhole life beyond the reach of suspicion,--that a man placed in such a\r\nsituation might oppose general character to general accusation, and\r\nstand collected in himself, poised on his own base, and defying all the\r\ncalumnies in the world. But as it shows a great and is a proof of a\r\nvirtuous mind to despise calumny, it is the proof of a guilty mind to\r\ndespise a specific accusation, when made before a competent authority,\r\nand with competent means to prove it. As Mr. Hastings's conduct was what\r\nno man living expected, I will venture to say that no expression can do\r\nit justice but his own. Upon reading the letter, and a motion being made\r\nthat Rajah Nundcomar be brought before the board to prove the charge\r\nagainst the Governor-General, the Governor-General enters the following\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\"Before the question is put, I declare that I will not suffer Nundcomar\r\nto appear before the board as my accuser. I know what belongs to the\r\ndignity and character of the first member of this administration. I will\r\nnot sit at this board in the character of a criminal, nor do I\r\nacknowledge the members of this board to be my judges. I am reduced on\r\nthis occasion to make the declaration, that I look upon General\r\nClavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr. Francis as my accusers. I cannot\r\nprove this in the direct letter of the law, but in my conscience I\r\nregard them as such, and I will give my reasons for it. On their arrival\r\nat this place, and on the first formation of the Council, they thought\r\nproper to take immediate and decisive measures in contradiction and for\r\nthe repeal of those which were formed by me in conjunction with the last\r\nadministration. I appealed to the Court of Directors from their acts.\r\nMany subsequent letters have been transmitted both by them and by me to\r\nthe Court of Directors: by me, in protestation against their conduct; by\r\nthem, in justification of it. Quitting this ground, they since appear to\r\nme to have chosen other modes of attack, apparently calculated to divert\r\nmy attention and to withdraw that of the public from the subject of our\r\nfirst differences, which regarded only the measures that were necessary\r\nfor the good of the service, to attacks directly and personally levelled\r\nat me for matters which tend to draw a personal and popular odium upon\r\nme: and fit instruments they have found for their purpose,--Mr. Joseph\r\nFowke, Mahrajah Nundcomar, Roopnarain Chowdry, and the Ranny of Burdwan.\r\n\r\n\"It appears incontestably upon the records that the charges preferred by\r\nthe Ranny against me proceeded from the office of Mr. Fowke. All the\r\npapers transmitted by her came in their original form written in the\r\nEnglish language,--some with Persian papers, of which they were supposed\r\nto be translations, but all strongly marked with the character and idiom\r\nof the English language. I applied on Saturday last for Persian\r\noriginals of some of the papers sent by her, and I was refused: I am\r\njustified in declaring my firm belief that no such originals exist.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to Nundcomar's accusations, they were delivered by the\r\nhands of Mr. Francis, who has declared that he was called upon by Rajah\r\nNundcomar, as a duty belonging to his office as a councillor of this\r\nstate, to lay the packet which contained them before the board,--that he\r\nconceived that he could not, consistent with his duty, refuse such a\r\nletter at the instance of a person of the Rajah's rank, and did\r\naccordingly receive it, and laid it before the board,--declaring at the\r\nsame time that he was unacquainted with the contents of it. I believe\r\nthat the Court of Directors, and those to whom those proceedings shall\r\nbe made known, will think differently of this action of Mr. Francis:\r\nthat Nundcomar was guilty of great insolence and disrespect in the\r\ndemand which he made of Mr. Francis; and that it was not a duty\r\nbelonging to the office of a councillor of this state to make himself\r\nthe carrier of a letter, which would have been much more properly\r\ncommitted to the hands of a peon or hircarra, or delivered by the writer\r\nof it to the secretary himself.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Francis has acknowledged that he apprehended in general that it\r\ncontained some charge against me. If the charge was false, it was a\r\nlibel. It might have been false for anything that Mr. Francis could know\r\nto the contrary, since he was unacquainted with the contents of it. In\r\nthis instance, therefore, he incurred the hazard of presenting a libel\r\nto the board: this was not a duty belonging to his office as a\r\ncouncillor of this state. I must further inform the board that I have\r\nbeen long since acquainted with Nundcomar's intentions of making this\r\nattack upon me. Happily, Nundcomar, among whose talents for intrigue\r\nthat of secrecy is not the first, has been ever too ready to make the\r\nfirst publication of his own intentions. I was shown a paper containing\r\nmany accusations against me, which I was told was carried by Nundcomar\r\nto Colonel Monson, and that he himself was employed for some hours in\r\nprivate with Colonel Monson, explaining the nature of those charges.\r\n\r\n\"I mention only what I was told; but as the rest of the report which was\r\nmade to me corresponds exactly with what has happened since, I hope I\r\nshall stand acquitted to my superiors and to the world in having given\r\nso much credit to it as to bring the circumstance upon record. I cannot\r\nrecollect the precise time in which this is said to have happened, but I\r\nbelieve it was either before or at the time of the dispatch of the\r\n'Bute' and 'Pacific.' The charge has since undergone some alteration;\r\nbut of the copy of the paper which was delivered to me, containing the\r\noriginal charge, I caused a translation to be made; when, suspecting the\r\nrenewal of the subject in this day's consultation, I brought it with me,\r\nand I desire it may be recorded, that, when our superiors, or the world,\r\nif the world is to be made the judge of my conduct, shall be possessed\r\nof these materials, they may, by comparing the supposed original and\r\namended list of accusations preferred against me by Nundcomar, judge how\r\nfar I am justified in the credit which I give to the reports above\r\nmentioned. I do not mean to infer from what I have said that it makes\r\nany alteration in the nature of the charges, whether they were delivered\r\nimmediately from my ostensible accusers, or whether they came to the\r\nboard through the channel of patronage; but it is sufficient to\r\nauthorize the conviction which I feel in my own mind, that those\r\ngentlemen are parties in the accusations of which they assert the right\r\nof being the judges.\r\n\r\n\"From the first commencement of this administration, every means have\r\nbeen tried both to deprive me of the legal authority with which I have\r\nbeen trusted, and to proclaim the annihilation of it to the world; but\r\nno instance has yet appeared of this in so extraordinary a degree as in\r\nthe question now before the board. The chief of the administration, your\r\nsuperior, Gentlemen, appointed by the legislature itself, shall I sit at\r\nthis board to be arraigned in the presence of a wretch whom you all know\r\nto be one of the basest of mankind? I believe I need not mention his\r\nname; but it is Nundcomar. Shall I sit here to hear men collected from\r\nthe dregs of the people give evidence, at his dictating, against my\r\ncharacter and conduct? I will not. You may, if you please, form\r\nyourselves into a committee for the investigation of these matters in\r\nany manner which you may think proper; but I will repeat, that I will\r\nnot meet Nundcomar at the board, nor suffer Nundcomar to be examined at\r\nthe board; nor have you a right to it, nor can it answer any other\r\npurpose than that of vilifying and insulting me to insist upon it.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to have found it necessary to deliver my sentiments on a\r\nsubject of so important a nature in an unpremeditated minute, drawn from\r\nme at the board, which I should have wished to have had leisure and\r\nretirement to have enabled me to express myself with that degree of\r\ncaution and exactness which the subject requires. I have said nothing\r\nbut what I believe and am morally certain I shall stand justified for in\r\nthe eyes of my superiors and the eyes of the world; but I reserve to\r\nmyself the liberty of adding my further sentiments in such a manner and\r\nform as I shall hereafter judge necessary.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see here the picture of Nundcomar drawn by Mr. Hastings\r\nhimself; you see the hurry, the passion, the precipitation, the\r\nconfusion, into which Mr. Hastings is thrown by the perplexity of\r\ndetected guilt; you see, my Lords, that, instead of defending himself,\r\nhe rails at his accuser in the most indecent language, calling him a\r\nwretch whom they all knew to be the basest of mankind,--that he rails at\r\nthe Council, by attributing their conduct to the worst of motives,--that\r\nhe rails at everybody, and declares the accusation to be a libel: in\r\nshort, you see plainly that the man's head is turned. You see there is\r\nnot a word he says upon this occasion which has common sense in it; you\r\nsee one great leading principle in it,--that he does not once attempt to\r\ndeny the charge. He attempts to vilify the witness, he attempts to\r\nvilify those he supposes to be his accusers, he attempts to vilify the\r\nCouncil; he lags upon the accusation, he mixes it with other\r\naccusations, which had nothing to do with it, and out of the whole he\r\ncollects a resolution--to do what? To meet his adversary and defy him?\r\nNo,--that he will not suffer him to appear before him: he says, \"I will\r\nnot sit at this board in the character of a criminal, nor do I\r\nacknowledge the board to be my judges.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not called upon to acknowledge them to be his judges. Both he and\r\nthey were called upon to inquire into all corruptions without exception.\r\nIt was his duty not merely [not?] to traverse and oppose them while\r\ninquiring into acts of corruption, but he was bound to take an active\r\npart in it,--that if they had a mind to let such a thing sleep upon\r\ntheir records, it was his duty to have brought forward the inquiry. They\r\nwere not his judges, they were not his accusers; they were his\r\nfellow-laborers in the inquiry ordered by the Court of Directors, their\r\nmasters, and by which inquiry he might be purged of that corruption with\r\nwhich he stood charged.\r\n\r\nHe says, \"Nundcomar is a wretch whom you all know to be the basest of\r\nmankind.\" I believe they did not know the man to be a wretch, or the\r\nbasest of mankind; but if he was a wretch, and if he was the basest of\r\nmankind, if he was guilty of all the crimes with which we charge Mr.\r\nHastings, (not one of which was ever proved against him,)--if any of\r\nyour Lordships were to have the misfortune to be before this tribunal,\r\nbefore any inquest of the House of Commons, or any other inquest of this\r\nnation, would you not say that it was the greatest possible advantage to\r\nyou that the man who accused you was a miscreant, the vilest and basest\r\nof mankind, by the confession of all the world? Do mankind really, then,\r\nthink that to be accused by men of honor, of weight, of character, upon\r\nprobable charges, is an advantage to them, and that to be accused by the\r\nbasest of mankind is a disadvantage? No: give me, if ever I am to have\r\naccusers, miscreants, as he calls him,--wretches, the basest and vilest\r\nof mankind. \"The board,\" says he, \"are my accusers.\" If they were, it\r\nwas their duty; but they were not his accusers, but were inquiring into\r\nmatters which it was equally his duty to inquire into. He would not\r\nsuffer Nundcomar to be produced; he would not suffer Nundcomar to be\r\nexamined; he rather suffered such an accusation to stand against his\r\nname and character than permit it to be inquired into. Do I want any\r\nother presumption of his guilt, upon such an occasion, than such conduct\r\nas this?\r\n\r\nThis man, whom he calls a wretch, the basest and vilest of mankind, was\r\nundoubtedly, by himself, in the records of the Company, declared to be\r\none of the first men of that country, everything that a subject could\r\nbe, a person illustrious for his birth, sacred with regard to his caste,\r\nopulent in fortune, eminent in situation, who had filled the very first\r\noffices in that country; and that he was, added to all this, a man of\r\nmost acknowledged talents, and of such a superiority as made the whole\r\npeople of Bengal appear to be an inferior race of beings compared to\r\nhim,--a man whose outward appearance and demeanor used to cause\r\nreverence and awe, and who at that time was near seventy years of age,\r\nwhich, without any other title, generally demands respect from mankind.\r\nAnd yet this man he calls the basest of mankind, a name which no man is\r\nentitled to call another till he has proved something to justify him in\r\nso doing; and notwithstanding his opulence, his high rank, station, and\r\nbirth, he despises him, and will not suffer him to be heard as an\r\naccuser before him. I will venture to say that Mr. Hastings, in so\r\ndoing, whether elevated by philosophy or inflated by pride, is not like\r\nthe rest of mankind. We do know, that, in all accusations, a great part\r\nof their weight and authority comes from the character, the situation,\r\nthe name, the description, the office, the dignity of the persons who\r\nbring them; mankind are so made, we cannot resist this prejudice; and it\r\nhas weight, and ever will have _primâ facie_ weight, in all the\r\ntribunals in the world. If, therefore, Rajah Nundcomar was a man who (it\r\nis not degrading to your Lordships to say) was equal in rank, according\r\nto the idea of his country, to any peer in this House, as sacred as a\r\nbishop, of as much gravity and authority as a judge, and who was\r\nprime-minister in the country in which he lived, with what face can Mr.\r\nHastings call this man a wretch, and say that he will not suffer him to\r\nbe brought before him? If, indeed, joined with such circumstances, the\r\naccuser be a person of bad morals, then, I admit, those bad morals take\r\naway from their weight; but for a proof of that you must have some other\r\ngrounds than the charges and the railing of the culprit against him.\r\n\r\nI might say that his passion is a proof of his guilt; and there is an\r\naction which is more odious than the crimes he attempts to cover,--_for\r\nhe has murdered this man by the hands of Sir Elijah Impey_; and if his\r\ncounsel should be unwise enough to endeavor to detract from the credit\r\nof this man by the pretended punishment to which he was brought, we will\r\nopen that dreadful scene to your Lordships, and you will see that it\r\ndoes not detract from his credit, but brings an eternal stain and\r\ndishonor upon the justice of Great Britain: I say nothing further of it.\r\nAs he stood there, as he gave that evidence that day, the evidence was\r\nto be received; it stands good, and is a record against Mr.\r\nHastings,--with this addition, that he would not suffer it to be\r\nexamined. He railed at his colleagues. He says, if the charge was false,\r\nthey were guilty of a libel. No: it might have been the effect of\r\nconspiracy, it might be punished in another way; but if it was false, it\r\nwas no libel. And all this is done to discountenance inquiry, to bring\r\nodium upon his colleagues for doing their duty, and to prevent that\r\ninquiry which could alone clear his character.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings had himself forgotten the character which he had given of\r\nNundcomar; but he says that his colleagues were perfectly well\r\nacquainted with him, and knew that he was a wretch, the basest of\r\nmankind. But before I read to you the character which Mr. Hastings gave\r\nof him, when he recommended him to the Presidency, (to succeed Mahomed\r\nReza Khân,) I am to let your Lordships understand fully the purpose for\r\nwhich Mr. Hastings gave it. Upon that occasion, all the Council, whom he\r\nstated to lie under suspicion of being bought by Mahomed Reza Khân, all\r\nthose persons with one voice cried out against Nundcomar; and as Mr.\r\nHastings was known to be of the faction the most opposite to Nundcomar,\r\nthey charged him with direct inconsistency in raising Nundcomar to that\r\nexalted trust,--a charge which Mr. Hastings could not repel any other\r\nway than by defending Nundcomar. The weight of their objections chiefly\r\nlay to Nundcomar's political character; his moral character was not\r\ndiscussed in that proceeding. Mr. Hastings says,--\r\n\r\n\"The President does not take upon him to vindicate the moral character\r\nof Nundcomar; his sentiments of this man's former political conduct are\r\nnot unknown to the Court of Directors, who, he is persuaded, will be\r\nmore inclined to attribute his present countenance of him to motives of\r\nzeal and fidelity to the service, in repugnance perhaps to his own\r\ninclinations, than to any predilection in his favor. He is very well\r\nacquainted with most of the facts alluded to in the minute of the\r\nmajority, having been a principal instrument in detecting them:\r\nnevertheless he thinks it but justice to make a distinction between the\r\nviolation of a trust and an offence committed against our government by\r\na man who owed it no allegiance, nor was indebted to it for protection,\r\nbut, on the contrary, was the minister and actual servant of a master\r\nwhose interest naturally suggested that kind of policy which sought, by\r\nforeign aids, and the diminution of the power of the Company, to raise\r\nhis own consequence, and to reëstablish his authority. He has never been\r\ncharged with any instance of infidelity to the Nabob Mir Jaffier, the\r\nconstant tenor of whose politics, from his first accession to the\r\nnizamut till his death, corresponded in all points so exactly with the\r\nartifices which were detected in his minister that they may be as fairly\r\nascribed to the one as to the other: their immediate object was beyond\r\nquestion the aggrandizement of the former, though the latter had\r\nultimately an equal interest in their success. The opinion which the\r\nNabob himself entertained of the services and of the fidelity of\r\nNundcomar evidently appeared in the distinguished marks which he\r\ncontinued to show him of his favor and confidence to the latest hour of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n\"His conduct in the succeeding administration appears not only to have\r\nbeen dictated by the same principles, but, if we may be allowed to speak\r\nfavorably of any measures which opposed the views of our own government\r\nand aimed at the support of an adverse interest, surely it was not only\r\nnot culpable, but even praiseworthy. He endeavored, as appears by the\r\nabstracts before us, to give consequence to his master, and to pave the\r\nway to his independence, by obtaining a firman from the king for his\r\nappointment to the subahship; and he opposed the promotion of Mahomed\r\nReza Khân, because he looked upon it as a supersession of the rights and\r\nauthority of the Nabob. He is now an absolute dependant and subject of\r\nthe Company, on whose favor he must rest all his hopes of future\r\nadvancement.\"\r\n\r\nThe character here given of him is that of an excellent patriot, a\r\ncharacter which all your Lordships, in the several situations which you\r\nenjoy or to which you may be called, will envy,--the character of a\r\nservant who stuck to his master against all foreign encroachments, who\r\nstuck to him to the last hour of his life, and had the dying testimony\r\nof his master to his services.\r\n\r\nCould Sir John Clavering, could Colonel Monson, could Mr. Francis know\r\nthat this man, of whom Mr. Hastings had given that exalted character\r\nupon the records of the Company, was the basest and vilest of mankind?\r\nNo, they ought to have esteemed him the contrary: they knew him to be a\r\nman of rank, they knew him to be a man perhaps of the first capacity in\r\nthe world, and they knew that Mr. Hastings had given this honorable\r\ntestimony of him on the records of the Company but a very little time\r\nbefore; and there was no reason why they should think or know, as he\r\nexpresses it, that he was the basest and vilest of mankind. From the\r\naccount, therefore, of Mr. Hastings himself, he was a person competent\r\nto accuse, a witness fit to be heard; and that is all I contend for. Mr.\r\nHastings would not hear him, he would not suffer the charge he had\r\nproduced to be examined into.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown to your Lordships that Mr. Hastings employed Nundcomar\r\nto inquire into the conduct and to be the principal manager of a\r\nprosecution against Mahomed Reza Khân. Will you suffer this man to\r\nqualify and disqualify witnesses and prosecutors agreeably to the\r\npurposes which his own vengeance and corruption may dictate in one case,\r\nand which the defence of those corruptions may dictate in another? Was\r\nNundcomar a person fit to be employed in the greatest and most sacred\r\ntrusts in the country, and yet not fit to be a witness to the sums of\r\nmoney which he paid Mr. Hastings for those trusts? Was Nundcomar a fit\r\nwitness to be employed and a fit person to be used in the prosecution of\r\nMahomed Reza Khân, and yet not fit to be employed against Mr. Hastings,\r\nwho himself had employed him in the very prosecution of Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân?\r\n\r\nIf Nundcomar was an enemy to Mr. Hastings, he was an enemy to Mahomed\r\nReza Khân; and Mr. Hastings employed him, avowedly and professedly on\r\nthe records of the Company, on account of the very qualification of that\r\nenmity. Was he a wretch, the basest of mankind, when opposed to Mr.\r\nHastings? Was he not as much a wretch, and as much the basest of\r\nmankind, when Mr. Hastings employed him in the prosecution of the first\r\nmagistrate and Mahometan of the first descent in Asia? Mr. Hastings\r\nshall not qualify and disqualify men at his pleasure; he must accept\r\nthem such as they are; and it is a presumption of his guilt accompanying\r\nthe charge, (which I never will separate from it,) that he would not\r\nsuffer the man to be produced who made the accusation. And I therefore\r\ncontend, that, as the accusation was so made, so witnessed, so detailed,\r\nso specific, so entered upon record, and so entered upon record in\r\nconsequence of the inquiries ordered by the Company, his refusal and\r\nrejection of inquiry into it is a presumption of his guilt.\r\n\r\nHe is full of his idea of dignity. It is right for every man to preserve\r\nhis dignity. There is a dignity of station, which a man has in trust to\r\npreserve; there is a dignity of personal character, which every man by\r\nbeing made man is bound to preserve. But you see Mr. Hastings's idea of\r\ndignity has no connection with integrity; it has no connection with\r\nhonest fame; it has no connection with the reputation which he is bound\r\nto preserve. What, my Lords, did he owe nothing to the Company that had\r\nappointed him? Did he owe nothing to the legislature,--did he owe\r\nnothing to your Lordships, and to the House of Commons, who had\r\nappointed him? Did he owe nothing to himself? to the country that bore\r\nhim? Did he owe nothing to the world, as to its opinion, to which every\r\npublic man owes a reputation? What an example was here held out to the\r\nCompany's servants!\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings says, \"This may come into a court of justice; it will come\r\ninto a court of justice: I reserve my defence on the occasion till it\r\ncomes into a court of justice, and here I make no opposition to it.\" To\r\nthis I answer, that the Company did not order him so to reserve himself,\r\nbut ordered him to be an inquirer into those things. Is it a lesson to\r\nbe taught to the inferior servants of the Company, that, provided they\r\ncan escape out of a court of justice by the back-doors and sally-ports\r\nof the law, by artifice of pleading, by those strict and rigorous rules\r\nof evidence which have been established for the protection of innocence,\r\nbut which by them might be turned to the protection and support of\r\nguilt, that such an escape is enough for them? that an Old Bailey\r\nacquittal is enough to establish a fitness for trust? and if a man shall\r\ngo acquitted out of such a court, because the judges are bound to acquit\r\nhim against the conviction of their own opinion, when every man in the\r\nmarket-place knows that he is guilty, that he is fit for a trust? Is it\r\na lesson to be held out to the servants of the Company, that, upon the\r\nfirst inquiry which is made into corruption, and that in the highest\r\ntrust, by the persons authorized to inquire into it, he uses all the\r\npowers of that trust to quash it,--vilifying his colleagues, vilifying\r\nhis accuser, abusing everybody, but never denying the charge? His\r\nassociates and colleagues, astonished at this conduct, so wholly unlike\r\neverything that had ever appeared of innocence, request him to consider\r\na little better. They declare they are not his accusers; they tell him\r\nthey are not his judges; that they, under the orders of the Company, are\r\nmaking an inquiry which he ought to make. He declares he will not make\r\nit. Being thus driven to the wall, he says, \"Why do you not form\r\nyourselves into a committee? I won't suffer these proceedings to go on\r\nas long as I am present.\" Mr. Hastings plainly had in view, that, if the\r\nproceedings had been before a committee, there would have been a doubt\r\nof their authenticity, as not being before a regular board; and he\r\ncontended that there could be no regular board without his own presence\r\nin it: a poor, miserable scheme for eluding this inquiry; partly by\r\nsaying that it was carried on when he was not present, and partly by\r\ndenying the authority of this board.\r\n\r\nI will have nothing to do with the great question that arose upon the\r\nGovernor-General's resolution to dissolve a board, whether the board\r\nhave a right to sit afterwards; it is enough that Mr. Hastings would not\r\nsuffer them, as a Council, to examine into what, as a Council, they were\r\nbound to examine into. He absolutely declared the Council dissolved,\r\nwhen they did not accept his committee, for which they had many good\r\nreasons, as I shall show in reply, if necessary, and which he could have\r\nno one good reason for proposing;--he then declares the Council\r\ndissolved. The Council, who did not think Mr. Hastings had a power to\r\ndissolve them while proceeding in the discharge of their duty, went on\r\nas a Council. They called in Nundcomar to support his charge: Mr.\r\nHastings withdrew. Nundcomar was asked what he had to say further in\r\nsupport of his own evidence. Upon which he produces a letter from Munny\r\nBegum, the dancing-girl that I have spoken of, in which she gives him\r\ndirections and instructions relative to his conduct in every part of\r\nthose bribes; by which it appears that the corrupt agreement for her\r\noffice was made with Mr. Hastings through Nundcomar, before he had\r\nquitted Calcutta. It points out the execution of it, and the manner in\r\nwhich every part of the sum was paid: one lac by herself in Calcutta;\r\none lac, which she ordered Nundcomar to borrow, and which he did borrow;\r\nand a lac and a half which were given to him, Mr. Hastings, besides this\r\npurchase money, under color of an entertainment. This letter was\r\nproduced, translated, examined, criticized, proved to be sealed with the\r\nseal of the Begum, acknowledged to have no marks but those of\r\nauthenticity upon it, and as such was entered upon the Company's\r\nrecords, confirming and supporting the evidence of Nundcomar, part by\r\npart, and circumstance by circumstance. And I am to remark, that, since\r\nthis document, so delivered in, has never been litigated or controverted\r\nin the truth of it, from that day to this, by Mr. Hastings, so, if there\r\nwas no more testimony, here is enough, upon this business. Your\r\nLordships will remark that this charge consisted of two parts: two lacs\r\nthat were given explicitly for the corrupt purchase of the office; and\r\none lac and a half given in reality for the same purpose, but under the\r\ncolor of what is called an entertainment.\r\n\r\nNow in the course of these proceedings it was thought necessary that Mr.\r\nHastings's banian, Cantoo Baboo, (a name your Lordships will be well\r\nacquainted with, and who was the minister in this and all the other\r\ntransactions of Mr. Hastings,) should be called before the board to\r\nexplain some circumstances in the proceedings. Mr. Hastings ordered his\r\nbanian, a native, not to attend the sovereign board appointed by\r\nParliament for the government of that country, and directed to inquire\r\ninto transactions of this nature. He thus taught the natives not only to\r\ndisobey the orders of the Court of Directors, enforced by an act of\r\nParliament, but he taught his own servant to disobey, and ordered him\r\nnot to appear before the board. Quarrels, duels, and other mischiefs\r\narose. In short, Mr. Hastings raised every power of heaven and of hell\r\nupon this subject: but in vain: the inquiry went on.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings does not meet Nundcomar: he was afraid of him. But he was\r\nnot negligent of his own defence; for he flies to the Supreme Court of\r\nJustice. He there prosecuted an inquiry against Nundcomar for a\r\nconspiracy. Failing in that, he made other attempts, and disabled\r\nNundcomar from appearing before the board by having him imprisoned, and\r\nthus utterly crippled that part of the prosecution against him. But as\r\nguilt is never able thoroughly to escape, it did so happen, that the\r\nCouncil, finding monstrous deficiencies in the Begum's affairs, finding\r\nthe Nabob's allowance totally squandered, that the most sacred pensions\r\nwere left unpaid, that nothing but disorder and confusion reigned in all\r\nhis affairs, that the Nabob's education was neglected, that he could\r\nscarcely read or write, that there was scarcely any mark of a man left\r\nin him except those which Nature had at first imprinted,--I say, all\r\nthese abuses being produced in a body before them, they thought it\r\nnecessary to send up to inquire into them; and a considerable deficiency\r\nor embezzlement appearing in the Munny Begum's account of the young\r\nNabob's stipend, she voluntarily declared, by a writing under her seal,\r\nthat she had given 15,000_l._ to Mr. Hastings for an entertainment.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, finding that the charge must come fully against him,\r\ncontrived a plan which your Lordships will see the effects of presently,\r\nand this was, to confound this lac and an half, or 15,000_l._, with the\r\ntwo lacs given directly and specifically as a bribe,--intending to avail\r\nhimself of this finesse whenever any payment was to be proved of the two\r\nlacs, which he knew would be proved against him, and which he never did\r\ndeny; and accordingly your Lordships will find some confusion in the\r\nproofs of the payment of those sums. The receipt of two lacs is proved\r\nby Nundcomar, proved with all the means of detection which I have\r\nstated; the receipt of the lac and a half is proved by Munny Begum's\r\nletter, the authenticity of which was established, and never denied by\r\nMr. Hastings. In addition to these proofs, Rajah Gourdas, who had the\r\nmanagement of the Nabob's treasury, verbally gave an account perfectly\r\ncorresponding with that of Nundcomar and the Munny Begum's letter; and\r\nhe afterwards gave in writing an attestation, which in every point\r\nagrees correctly with the others. So that there are three witnesses upon\r\nthis business. And he shall not disqualify Rajah Gourdas, because,\r\nwhatever character he thought fit to give Nundcomar, he has given the\r\nbest of characters to Rajah Gourdas, who was employed by Mr. Hastings in\r\noccupations of trust, and therefore any objections to his competency\r\ncannot exist. Having got thus far, the only thing that remained was to\r\nexamine the records of the public offices, and see whether any trace of\r\nthese transactions was to be found there. These offices had been thrown\r\ninto confusion in the manner you will hear; but, upon strict inquiry,\r\nthere was a _shomaster_, or office paper, produced, from which it\r\nappears that the officer of the treasury, having brought to the Nabob an\r\naccount of one lac and a half which he said had been given to Mr.\r\nHastings, desired to know from him under what head of expense it should\r\nbe entered, and that he, the Nabob, desired him to put it under the head\r\nof expenses for entertaining Mr. Hastings. If there had been a head of\r\nentertainment established as a regular affair, the officer would never\r\nhave gone to the Nabob and asked under what name to enter it; but he\r\nfound an irregular affair, and he did not know what head to put it\r\nunder. And from the whole of the proceedings it appears that three lacs\r\nand a half were paid: two lac by way of bribe, one lac and a half under\r\nthe color of an entertainment. Mr. Hastings endeavors to invalidate the\r\nfirst obliquely, not directly, for he never directly denied it; and he\r\npartly admits the second, in hopes that all the proof of payment of the\r\nfirst charge should be merged and confounded in the second. And\r\ntherefore your Lordships will see from the beginning of that business\r\ntill it came into the hands of Mr. Smith, his agent, then appearing in\r\nthe name and character of agent and solicitor to the Company, that this\r\nwas done to give some appearance and color to it by a false\r\nrepresentation, as your Lordships will see, of every part of the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nThe proof, then, of the two lacs rests upon the evidence of Nundcomar,\r\nthe letter of Munny Begum, and the evidence of Rajah Gourdas. The\r\nevidence of the lac and a half, by way of entertainment, was at first\r\nthe same; and afterwards begins a series of proofs to which Mr. Hastings\r\nhas himself helped us. For, in the first place, he produces this office\r\npaper in support of his attempt to establish the confusion between the\r\npayment of the two lacs and of the lac and a half. He did not himself\r\ndeny that he received a lac and a half, because with respect to that lac\r\nand a half he had founded some principle of justification. Accordingly\r\nthis office paper asserts and proves this lac and a half to have been\r\ngiven, in addition to the other proofs. Then Munny Begum herself is\r\ninquired of. There is a commission appointed to go up to her residence;\r\nand the fact is proved to the satisfaction of Mr. Goring, the\r\ncommissioner. The Begum had put a paper of accounts, through her son,\r\ninto his hands, which shall be given at your Lordships' bar, in which\r\nshe expressly said that she gave Mr. Hastings a lac and a half for\r\nentertainment. But Mr. Hastings objects to Mr. Goring's evidence upon\r\nthis occasion. He wanted to supersede Mr. Goring in the inquiry; and he\r\naccordingly appoints, with the consent of the Council, two creatures of\r\nhis own to go and assist in that inquiry. The question which he directs\r\nthese commissioners to put to Munny Begum is this:--\"Was the sum of\r\nmoney charged by you to be given to Mr. Hastings given under an idea of\r\nentertainment customary, or upon what other ground, or for what other\r\nreason?\" He also desires the following questions may be proposed to the\r\nBegum:--\"Was any application made to you for the account which you have\r\ndelivered of three lacs and a half of rupees said to have been paid to\r\nthe Governor and Mr. Middleton? or did you deliver the account of your\r\nown free will, and unsolicited?\" My Lords, you see that with regard to\r\nthe whole three lacs and a half of rupees the Begum had given an account\r\nwhich tended to confirm the payment of them; but Mr. Hastings wanted to\r\ninvalidate that account by supposing she gave it under restraint. The\r\nsecond question is,--\"In what manner was the application made to you,\r\nand by whom?\" But the principal question is this:--\"On what account was\r\nthe one lac and a half given to the Governor-General which you have laid\r\nto his account? Was it in consequence of any requisition from him, or of\r\nany previous agreement, or of any established usage?\" When a man asks\r\nconcerning a sum of money, charged to be given to him by another person,\r\non what account it was given, he does indirectly admit that that money\r\nactually was paid, and wants to derive a justification from the mode of\r\nthe payment of it; and accordingly that inference was drawn from the\r\nquestion so sent up, and it served as an instruction to Munny Begum; and\r\nher answer was, that it was given to him, as an ancient usage and\r\ncustom, for an entertainment. So that the fact of the gift of the money\r\nis ascertained by the question put by Mr. Hastings to her, and her\r\nanswer. And thus at last comes his accomplice in this business, and\r\ngives the fullest testimony to the lac and a half.\r\n\r\nI must beg leave, before I go further, to state the circumstances of\r\nthe several witnesses examined upon this business. They were of two\r\nkinds: voluntary witnesses, and accomplices forced by inquiry and\r\nexamination to discover their own guilt. Of the first kind were\r\nNundcomar and Rajah Gourdas: these were the only two that can be said to\r\nbe voluntary in the business, and who gave their information without\r\nmuch fear, though the last unwillingly, and with a full sense of the\r\ndanger of doing it. The other was the evidence of his accomplice, Munny\r\nBegum, wrung from her by the force of truth, in which she confessed that\r\nshe gave the lac and a half, and justifies it upon the ground of its\r\nbeing a customary entertainment. Besides this, there is the evidence of\r\nChittendur, who was one of Mr. Hastings's instruments, and one of the\r\nBegum's servants. He, being prepared to confound the two lacs with the\r\none lac and a half, says, upon his examination, that a lac and a half\r\nwas given; but upon examining into the particulars of it, he proves that\r\nthe sum he gave was two lacs, and not a lac and a half: for he says that\r\nthere was a dispute about the other half lac; Nundcomar demanded\r\ninterest, which the Begum was unwilling to allow, and consequently that\r\nhalf lac remained unpaid. Now this half lac can be no part of the lac\r\nand a half, which is admitted on all hands, and proved by the whole body\r\nof concurrent testimony, to have been given to Mr. Hastings in one\r\nlumping sum. When Chittendur endeavors to confound it with the lac and a\r\nhalf, he clearly establishes the fact that it was a parcel of the two\r\nlacs, and thus bears evidence, in attempting to prevaricate in favor of\r\nMr. Hastings, that one lac and a half was paid, which Mr. Hastings is\r\nwilling to allow; but when he enters into the particulars of it, he\r\nproves by the subdivision of the payment, and by the non-payment of part\r\nof it, that it accords with the two lacs, and not with the lac and a\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\nThere are other circumstances in these accounts highly auxiliary to this\r\nevidence. The lac and a half was not only attested by Rajah Gourdas, by\r\nthe Begum, by Chittendur, by the Begum again upon Mr. Hastings's own\r\nquestion, indirectly admitted by Mr. Hastings, proved by the orders for\r\nit to be written off to expense, (such a body of proof as perhaps never\r\nexisted,) but there is one proof still remaining, namely, a paper, which\r\nwas produced before the Committee, and which we shall produce to your\r\nLordships. It is an authentic paper, delivered in favor of Mr. Hastings\r\nby Major Scott, who acted at that time as Mr. Hastings's agent, to a\r\ncommittee of the House of Commons, and authenticated to come from Munny\r\nBegum herself. All this body of evidence we mean to produce; and we\r\nshall prove, first, that he received the two lacs,--and, secondly, that\r\nhe received one lac and a half under the name of entertainment. With\r\nregard to the lac and a half, Mr. Hastings is so far from controverting\r\nit, even indirectly, that he is obliged to establish it by testimonies\r\nproduced by himself, in order to sink in that, if he can, the two lacs,\r\nwhich he thinks he is not able to justify, but which he fears will be\r\nproved against him. The lac and a half, I do believe, he will not be\r\nadvised to contest; but whether he is or no, we shall load him with it,\r\nwe shall prove it beyond all doubt. But there are other circumstances\r\nfurther auxiliary in this business, which, from the very attempts to\r\nconceal it, prove beyond doubt the fraudulent and wicked nature of the\r\ntransaction. In the account given by the Begum, a lac, which is for Mr.\r\nHastings's entertainment, is entered in a suspicious neighborhood; for\r\nthere is there entered a lac of rupees paid for the subahdarry sunnuds\r\nto the Mogul through the Rajah Shitab Roy. Upon looking into the\r\naccount, and comparing it with another paper produced, the first thing\r\nwe find is, that this woman charges the sum paid to be a sum due; and\r\nthen she charges this one lac to have been paid when the Mogul was in\r\nthe hands of the Mahrattas, when all communication with him was stopped,\r\nand when Rajah Shitab Roy, who is supposed to have paid it, was under\r\nconfinement in the hands of Mr. Hastings. Thus she endeavors to conceal\r\nthe lac of rupees paid to Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this transaction, which, though not in itself\r\nintricate, is in some degree made so by Mr. Hastings, clear to your\r\nLordships, we pledge ourselves to give to your Lordships, what must be a\r\ngreat advantage to the culprit himself, a syllabus, the heads of all\r\nthis charge, and of the proofs themselves, with their references, to\r\nshow how far the proof goes to the two lacs, and then to the one lac and\r\na half singly. This we shall put in writing, that you may not depend\r\nupon the fugitive memory of a thing not so well, perhaps, or powerfully\r\nexpressed as it ought to be, and in order to give every advantage to the\r\ndefendant, and to give every facility to your Lordships' judgment: and\r\nthis will, I believe, be thought a clear and fair way of proceeding.\r\nYour Lordships will then judge whether Mr. Hastings's conduct at the\r\ntime, his resisting an inquiry, preventing his servant appearing as an\r\nevidence, discountenancing and discouraging his colleagues, raising\r\nevery obstruction to the prosecution, dissolving the Council,\r\npreventing evidence and destroying it as far as lay in his power by\r\ncollateral means, be not also such presumptive proofs as give double\r\nforce to all the positive proof we produce against him.\r\n\r\nThe lac and a half, I know, he means to support upon the custom of\r\nentertainment; and your Lordships will judge whether or not a man who\r\nwas ordered and had covenanted never to take more than 400_l._ could\r\ntake 16,000_l._ under color of an entertainment. That which he intends\r\nto produce as a justification we charge, and your Lordships and the\r\nworld will think, to be the heaviest aggravation of his crime. And after\r\nexplaining to your Lordships the circumstances under which this\r\njustification is made, and leaving a just impression of them upon your\r\nminds, I shall beg your Lordships' indulgence to finish this member of\r\nthe business to-morrow.\r\n\r\nIt is stated and entered in the account, that an entertainment was\r\nprovided for Mr. Hastings at the rate of 200_l._ a day. He stayed at\r\nMoorshedabad for near three months; and thus you see that visits from\r\nMr. Hastings are pretty expensive things: it is at the rate of\r\n73,000_l._ a year for his entertainment. We find that Mr. Middleton, an\r\nEnglish gentleman who was with him, received likewise (whether under the\r\nsame pretence I know not, and it does not signify) another sum equal to\r\nit; and if these two gentlemen had stayed in that country a year, their\r\nseveral allowances would have been 146,000_l._ out of the Nabob's\r\nallowance of 160,000_l._ a year: they would have eat up nearly the whole\r\nof it. And do you wonder, my Lords, that such guests and such hosts are\r\ndifficult to be divided? Do you wonder that such visits, when so well\r\npaid for and well provided for, were naturally long? There is hardly a\r\nprince in Europe who would give to another prince of Europe from his\r\nroyal hospitality what was given upon this occasion to Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what was Mr. Hastings's business during this long\r\nprotracted visit. First, he tells you that he came there to reduce all\r\nthe state and dignity of the Nabob. He tells you that he felt no\r\ncompunction in reducing that state; that the elephants, the menagerie,\r\nthe stables, all went without mercy, and consequently all the persons\r\nconcerned in them were dismissed also. When he came to the abolition of\r\nthe pensions, he says,--\"I proceeded with great pain, from the\r\nreflection that I was the instrument in depriving whole families, all at\r\nonce, of their bread, and reducing them to a state of penury: convinced\r\nof the necessity of the measure, I endeavored to execute it with great\r\nimpartiality.\" Here he states the work he was employed in, when he took\r\nthis two hundred pounds a day for his own pay. \"It was necessary to\r\nbegin with reforming the useless servants of the court, and retrenching\r\nthe idle parade of elephants, menageries, &c., which loaded the civil\r\nlist. This cost little regret in performing; but the Resident, who took\r\nupon himself the chief share in this business, acknowledges that he\r\nsuffered considerably in his feelings, when he came to touch on the\r\npension list. Some hundreds of persons of the ancient nobility of the\r\ncountry, excluded, under our government, from almost all employments,\r\ncivil or military, had, ever since the revolution, depended on the\r\nbounty of the Nabob; and near ten lacs were bestowed that way. It is not\r\nthat the distribution was always made with judgment or impartial, and\r\nmuch room was left for a reform; but when the question was to cut off\r\nentirely the greatest part, it could not fail to be accompanied with\r\ncircumstances of real distress. The Resident declares, that, even with\r\nsome of the highest rank, he could not avoid discovering, under all the\r\npride of Eastern manners, the manifest marks of penury and want. There\r\nwas, however, no room left for hesitation: to confine the Nabob's\r\nexpenses within the limited sum, it was necessary that pensions should\r\nbe set aside.\"\r\n\r\nHere, my Lords, is a man sent to execute one of the most dreadful\r\noffices that was ever executed by man,--to cut off, as he says himself,\r\nwith a bleeding heart, the only remaining allowance made for hundreds of\r\nthe decayed nobility and gentry of a great kingdom, driven by our\r\ngovernment from the offices upon which they existed. In this moment of\r\nanxiety and affliction, when he says he felt pain and was cut to the\r\nheart to do it,--at this very moment, when he was turning over fourteen\r\nhundred of the ancient nobility and gentry of this country to downright\r\nwant of bread,--just at that moment, while he was doing this act, and\r\nfeeling this act in this manner, from the collected morsels forced from\r\nthe mouths of that indigent and famished nobility he gorged his own\r\nravenous maw with an allowance of two hundred pounds a day for his\r\nentertainment. As we see him in this business, this man is unlike any\r\nother: he is also never corrupt but he is cruel; he never dines without\r\ncreating a famine; he does not take from the loose superfluity of\r\nstanding greatness, but falls upon the indigent, the oppressed, and\r\nruined; he takes to himself double what would maintain them. His is\r\nunlike the generous rapacity of the noble eagle, who preys upon a\r\nliving, struggling, reluctant, equal victim; his is like that of the\r\nravenous vulture, who falls upon the decayed, the sickly, the dying, and\r\nthe dead, and only anticipates Nature in the destruction of its object.\r\nHis cruelty is beyond his corruption: but there is something in his\r\nhypocrisy which is more terrible than his cruelty; for, at the very time\r\nwhen with double and unsparing hands he executes a proscription, and\r\nsweeps off the food of hundreds of the nobility and gentry of a great\r\ncountry, his eyes overflow with tears, and he turns the precious balm\r\nthat bleeds from wounded humanity, and is its best medicine, into fatal,\r\nrancorous, mortal poison to the human race.\r\n\r\nYou have seen, that, when he takes two hundred pounds a day for his\r\nentertainment, he tells you that in this very act he is starving\r\nfourteen hundred of the ancient nobility and gentry. My Lords, you have\r\nthe blood of nobles,--if not, you have the blood of men in your veins:\r\nyou feel as nobles, you feel as men. What would you say to a cruel Mogul\r\nexactor, by whom after having been driven from your estates, driven from\r\nthe noble offices, civil and military, which you hold, driven from your\r\nbishoprics, driven from your places at court, driven from your offices\r\nas judges, and, after having been reduced to a miserable flock of\r\npensioners, your very pensions were at last wrested from your mouths,\r\nand who, though at the very time when those pensions were wrested from\r\nyou he declares them to have been the only bread of a miserable decayed\r\nnobility, takes himself two hundred pounds a day for his entertainment,\r\nand continues it till it amounts to sixteen thousand pounds? I do\r\nthink, that, of all the corruptions which he has not owned, but has not\r\ndenied, or of those which he does in effect own, and of which he brings\r\nforward the evidence himself, the taking and claiming under color of an\r\nentertainment is ten times the most nefarious.\r\n\r\nI shall this day only further trouble your Lordships to observe that he\r\nhas never directly denied this transaction. I have tumbled over the\r\nrecords, I have looked at every part, to see whether he denies it. He\r\ndid not deny it at the time, he did not deny it to the Court of\r\nDirectors: on the contrary, he did in effect acknowledge it, when,\r\nwithout directly acknowledging it, he promised them a full and liberal\r\nexplanation of the whole transaction. He never did give that\r\nexplanation. Parliament took up the business; this matter was reported\r\nat the end of the Eleventh Report; but though the House of Commons had\r\nthus reported it, and made that public which before was upon the\r\nCompany's records, he took no notice of it. Then another occasion\r\narises: he comes before the House of Commons; he knows he is about to be\r\nprosecuted for those very corruptions; he well knows these charges exist\r\nagainst him; he makes his defence (if he will allow it to be his\r\ndefence); but, though thus driven, he did not there deny it, because he\r\nknew, that, if he had denied it, it could be proved against him. I\r\ndesire your Lordships will look at that paper which we have given in\r\nevidence, and see if you find a word of denial of it: there is much\r\ndiscourse, much folly, much insolence, but not one word of denial. Then,\r\nat last, it came before this tribunal against him. I desire to refer\r\nyour Lordships to that part of his defence to the article in which this\r\nbribe is specifically charged: he does not deny it there; the only\r\nthing which looks like a denial is one sweeping clause inserted, (in\r\norder to put us upon the proof,) that all the charges are to be\r\nconceived as denied; but a specific denial to this specific charge in no\r\nstage of the business, from beginning to end, has he once made.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore here I close that part of the charge which relates to the\r\nbusiness of Nundcomar. Your Lordships will see such a body of\r\npresumptive proof and positive proof as never was given yet of any\r\nsecret corrupt act of bribery; and there I leave it with your Lordships'\r\njustice. I beg pardon for having detained you so long; but your\r\nLordships will be so good as to observe that no business ever was\r\ncovered with more folds of iniquitous artifice than this which is now\r\nbrought before you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nON\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH ARTICLE OF CHARGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND DAY: SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--When I last had the honor of addressing your Lordships, I\r\nendeavored to state with as much perspicuity as the nature of an\r\nintricate affair would admit, and as largely as in so intricate an\r\naffair was consistent with the brevity which I endeavored to preserve,\r\nthe proofs which had been adduced against Warren Hastings upon an\r\ninquiry instituted by an order of the Court of Directors into the\r\ncorruption and peculation of persons in authority in India. My Lords, I\r\nhave endeavored to show you by anterior presumptive proofs, drawn from\r\nthe nature and circumstances of the acts themselves inferring guilt,\r\nthat such actions and such conduct could be referable only to one cause,\r\nnamely, _corruption_; I endeavored to show you afterwards, my Lords,\r\nwhat the specific nature and extent of the corruption was, as far as it\r\ncould be fully proved; and lastly, the great satisfactory presumption\r\nwhich attended the inquiry with regard to Mr. Hastings,--namely, that,\r\ncontrary to law, contrary to his duty, contrary to what is owed by\r\ninnocence to itself, Mr. Hastings resisted that inquiry, and employed\r\nall the power of his office to prevent the exercise of it, either in\r\nhimself or in others. These presumptions and these proofs will be\r\nbrought before your Lordships, distinctly and in order, at the end of\r\nthis opening.\r\n\r\nThe next point on which I thought it necessary to proceed was relative\r\nto the presumptions which his subsequent conduct gave with regard to his\r\nguilt: because, my Lords, his uniform tenor of conduct, such as must\r\nattend guilt, both in the act, at the time of the inquiry, and\r\nsubsequent to it, will form such a body of satisfactory evidence as I\r\nbelieve the human mind is not made to resist.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, there is another reason why I choose to enter into the\r\npresumptions drawn from his conduct and the fact, taking his conduct in\r\ntwo parts, if it may be so expressed, _omission_ and _commission_, in\r\norder that your Lordships should more fully enter into the consequences\r\nof this system of bribery. But before I say anything upon that, I wish\r\nyour Lordships to be apprised, that the Commons, in bringing this bribe\r\nof three lac and a half before your Lordships, do not wish by any means\r\nto have it understood that this is the whole of the bribe that was\r\nreceived by Mr. Hastings in consequence of delivering up the whole\r\nmanagement of the government of the country to that improper person whom\r\nhe nominated for it. My Lords, from the proofs that will be adduced\r\nbefore you, there is great probability that he received very nearly a\r\nhundred thousand pounds; there is positive proof of his receiving fifty;\r\nand we have chosen only to charge him with that of which there is such\r\nan accumulated body of proof as to leave no doubt upon the minds of your\r\nLordships. All this I say, because we are perfectly apprised of the\r\nsentiments of the public upon this point: when they hear of the enormity\r\nof Indian peculation, when they see the acts done, and compare them\r\nwith the bribes received, the acts seem so enormous and the bribes\r\ncomparatively so small, that they can hardly be got to attribute them to\r\nthat motive. What I mean to state is this: that, from a collective view\r\nof the subject, your Lordships will be able to judge that enormous\r\noffences have been committed, and that the bribe which we have given in\r\nproof is a specimen of the nature and extent of those enormous bribes\r\nwhich extend to much greater sums than we are able to prove before you\r\nin the manner your Lordships would like and expect.\r\n\r\nI have already remarked to your Lordships, that, after this charge was\r\nbrought and recorded before the Council in spite of the resistance made\r\nby Mr. Hastings, in which he employed all the power and authority of his\r\nstation, and the whole body of his partisans and associates in iniquity,\r\ndispersed through every part of these provinces,--after he had taken all\r\nthese steps, finding himself pressed by the proof and pressed by the\r\npresumption of his resistance to the inquiry, he did think it necessary\r\nto make something like a defence. Accordingly he has made what he calls\r\na justification, which did not consist in the denial of that fact, or\r\nany explanation of it. The mode he took for his defence was abuse of his\r\ncolleagues, abuse of the witnesses, and of every person who in the\r\nexecution of his duty was inquiring into the fact, and charging them\r\nwith things which, if true, were by no means sufficient to support him,\r\neither in defending the acts themselves, or in the criminal means he\r\nused to prevent inquiry into them. His design was to mislead their\r\nminds, and to carry them from the accusation and the proof of it. With\r\nrespect to the passion, violence, and intemperate heat with which he\r\ncharged them, they were proceeding in an orderly, regular manner; and if\r\non any occasion they seem to break out into warmth, it was in\r\nconsequence of that resistance which he made to them, in what your\r\nLordships, I believe, will agree with them in thinking was one of the\r\nmost important parts of their functions. If they had been intemperate in\r\ntheir conduct, if they had been violent, passionate, prejudiced against\r\nhim, it afforded him only a better means of making his defence; because,\r\nthough in a rational and judicious mind the intemperate conduct of the\r\naccuser certainly proves nothing with regard to the truth or falsehood\r\nof his accusation, yet we do know that the minds of men are so\r\nconstituted that an improper mode of conducting a right thing does form\r\nsome degree of prejudice against it. Mr. Hastings, therefore, unable to\r\ndefend himself upon principle, has resorted as much as he possibly could\r\nto prejudice. And at the same time that there is not one word of denial,\r\nor the least attempt at a refutation of the charge, he has loaded the\r\nrecords with all manner of minutes, proceedings, and letters relative to\r\neverything but the fact itself. The great aim of his policy, both then,\r\nbefore, and ever since, has been to divert the mind of the auditory, or\r\nthe persons to whom he addressed himself, from the nature of his cause,\r\nto some collateral circumstance relative to it,--a policy to which he\r\nhas always had recourse; but that trick, the last resource of despairing\r\nguilt, I trust will now completely fail him.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, however, began to be pretty sensible that this way of\r\nproceeding had a very unpromising and untoward look; for which reason he\r\nnext declared that he reserved his defence for fear of a legal\r\nprosecution, and that some time or other he would give a large and\r\nliberal explanation to the Court of Directors, to whom he was answerable\r\nfor his conduct, of his refusing to suffer the inquiry to proceed, of\r\nhis omitting to give them satisfaction at the time, of his omitting to\r\ntake any one natural step that an innocent man would have taken upon\r\nsuch an occasion. Under this promise he has remained from that time to\r\nthe time you see him at your bar, and he has neither denied, exculpated,\r\nexplained, or apologized for his conduct in any one single instance.\r\n\r\nWhile he accuses the intemperance of his adversaries, he shows a degree\r\nof temperance in himself which always attends guilt in despair: for\r\nstruggling guilt may be warm, but guilt that is desperate has nothing to\r\ndo but to submit to the consequences of it, to bear the infamy annexed\r\nto its situation, and to try to find some consolation in the effects of\r\nguilt with regard to private fortune for the scandal it brings them into\r\nin public reputation. After the business had ended in India, the causes\r\nwhy he should have given the explanation grew stronger and stronger: for\r\nnot only the charges exhibited against him were weighty, but the manner\r\nin which he was called upon to inquire into them was such as would\r\nundoubtedly tend to stir the mind of a man of character, to rouse him to\r\nsome consideration of himself, and to a sense of the necessity of his\r\ndefence. He was goaded to make this defence by the words I shall read to\r\nyour Lordships from Sir John Clavering.\r\n\r\n\"In the late proceedings of the Revenue Board it will appear that there\r\nis no species of peculation from which the Honorable Governor-General\r\nhas thought it reasonable to abstain.\" He further says, in answer to\r\nMr. Hastings, \"The malicious view with which this innuendo\" (an innuendo\r\nof Mr. Hastings) \"is thrown out is only worthy of a man who, having\r\ndisgraced himself in the eyes of every man of honor both in Asia and in\r\nEurope, and having no imputation to lay to our charge, has dared to\r\nattempt in the dark what malice itself could not find grounds to aim at\r\nopenly.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the charges which were made upon him,--not loosely, in the\r\nheat of conversation, but deliberately, in writing, entered upon record,\r\nand sent to his employers, the Court of Directors, those whom the law\r\nhad set over him, and to whose judgment and opinion he was responsible.\r\nDo your Lordships believe that it was conscious innocence that made him\r\nendure such reproaches, so recorded, from his own colleague? Was it\r\nconscious innocence that made him abandon his defence, renounce his\r\nexplanation, and bear all this calumny, (if it was calumny,) in such a\r\nmanner, without making any one attempt to refute it? Your Lordships will\r\nsee by this, and by other minutes with which the books are filled, that\r\nMr. Hastings is charged quite to the brim with corruptions of all sorts,\r\nand covered with every mode of possible disgrace. For there is something\r\nso base and contemptible in the crimes of peculation and bribery, that,\r\nwhen they come to be urged home and strongly against a man, as here they\r\nare urged, nothing but a consciousness of guilt can possibly make a\r\nperson so charged support himself under them. Mr. Hastings considered\r\nhimself, as he has stated, to be under the necessity of bearing them.\r\nWhat is that necessity? Guilt. Could he say that Sir John Clavering (for\r\nI say nothing now of Colonel Monson and Mr. Francis, who were joined\r\nwith him) was a man weak and contemptible? I believe there are those\r\namong your Lordships who remember that Sir John Clavering was known\r\nbefore he went abroad, and better known by his conduct after, to be a\r\nman of the most distinguished honor that ever served his Majesty; he\r\nserved his Majesty in a military situation for many years, and\r\nafterwards in that high civil situation in India. It is known that\r\nthrough every step and gradation of a high military service, until he\r\narrived at the highest of all, there never was the least blot upon him,\r\nor doubt or suspicion of his character; that his temper for the most\r\npart, and his manners, were fully answerable to his virtues, and a noble\r\nornament to them; that he was one of the best natured, best bred men, as\r\nwell as one of the highest principled men to be found in his Majesty's\r\nservice; that he had passed the middle time of life, and come to an age\r\nwhich makes men wise in general; so that he could be warmed by nothing\r\nbut that noble indignation at guilt which is the last thing that ever\r\nwas or will be extinguished in a virtuous mind. He was a man whose voice\r\nwas not to be despised; but if his character had been personally as\r\ncontemptible as it was meritorious and honorable in every respect, yet\r\nhis situation as a commissioner named by an act of Parliament for the\r\nexpress purpose of reforming India gave him a weight and consequence\r\nthat could not suffer Mr. Hastings, without a general and strong\r\npresumption of his guilt, to acquiesce in such recorded minutes from\r\nhim. But if he had been a weak, if he had been an intemperate man, (in\r\nreality he was as cool, steady, temperate, judicious a man as ever was\r\nborn,) the Court of Directors, to whom Mr. Hastings was responsible by\r\nevery tie and every principle, and was made responsible at last by a\r\npositive act of Parliament obliging him to yield obedience to their\r\ncommands as the general rule of his duty,--the Court of Directors, I\r\nsay, perfectly approved of every part of General Clavering's, Colonel\r\nMonson's, and Mr. Francis's conduct; they approved of this inquiry which\r\nMr. Hastings rejected; and they have declared, \"that the powers and\r\ninstructions vested in and given to General Clavering and the other\r\ngentlemen were such as fully authorized them in every inquiry that seems\r\nto have been their object ... Europeans.\"[2]\r\n\r\nNow after the supreme authority, to which they were to appeal in all\r\ntheir disputes, had passed this judgment upon this very inquiry, the\r\nmatter no longer depended upon Mr. Hastings's opinion; nor could he be\r\nlonger justified in attributing that to evil motives either of malice or\r\npassion in his colleagues. When the judges who were finally to determine\r\nwho was malicious, who was passionate, who was or was not justified\r\neither in setting on foot the inquiry or resisting it, had passed that\r\njudgment, then Mr. Hastings was called upon by all the feelings of a\r\nman, and by his duty in Council, to give satisfaction to his masters,\r\nthe Directors, who approved of the zeal and diligence shown in that very\r\ninquiry, the passion of which he only reprobated, and upon which he\r\ngrounded his justification.\r\n\r\nIf anything but conscious guilt could have possibly influenced him to\r\nsuch more than patience under this accusation, let us see what was his\r\nconduct when the scene was changed. General Clavering, fatigued and\r\nbroken down by the miseries of his situation, soon afterwards lost a\r\nvery able and affectionate colleague, Colonel Monson, (whom Mr. Hastings\r\nstates to be one of the bitterest of his accusers,) a man one of the\r\nmost loved and honored of his time, a person of your Lordships' noble\r\nblood, and a person who did honor to it, and if he had been of the\r\nfamily of a commoner, well deserved to be raised to your distinction.\r\nWhen that man died,--died of a broken heart, to say nothing else,--and\r\nGeneral Clavering felt himself in a manner without help, except what he\r\nderived from the firmness, assiduity, and patience of Mr. Francis,\r\nsinking like himself under the exertion of his own virtues, he was\r\nresolved to resign his employment. The Court of Directors were so\r\nalarmed at this attempt of his to resign his employment, that they wrote\r\nthus: \"When you conceived the design of quitting our service, we imagine\r\nyou could not have heard of the resignation of Mr. Hastings ... your\r\nzeal and ability.\"[3]\r\n\r\nMy Lords, in this struggle, and before he could resign finally, another\r\nkind of resignation, the resignation of Nature, took place, and Sir John\r\nClavering died. The character that was given Sir John Clavering at that\r\ntime is a seal to the whole of his proceedings, and the use that I shall\r\nmake of it your Lordships will see presently. \"The abilities of General\r\nClavering, the comprehensive knowledge he had attained of our affairs\r\n... to the East India Company.\"[4]\r\n\r\nAnd never had it a greater loss. There is the concluding funeral\r\noration made by his masters, upon a strict, though by no means partial,\r\nview of his conduct. My Lords, here is the man who is the great accuser\r\nof Mr. Hastings, as he says. What is he? a slight man, a man of mean\r\nsituation, a man of mean talents, a man of mean character? No: of the\r\nhighest character. Was he a person whose conduct was disapproved by\r\ntheir common superiors? No: it was approved when living, and ratified\r\nwhen dead. This was the man, a man equal to him in every respect, upon\r\nthe supposed evil motives of whom alone was founded the sole\r\njustification of Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nBut be it, then, that Sir John Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr.\r\nFrancis were all of them the evil-minded persons that he describes them\r\nto be, and that from dislike to them, from a kind of manly resentment,\r\nif you please, against such persons, an hatred against malicious\r\nproceedings, and a defiance of them, he did not think proper, as he\r\nstates, to make his defence during that period of time, and while\r\noppressed by that combination,--yet, when he got rid of the two former\r\npersons, and when Mr. Francis was nothing, when the whole majority was\r\nin his hand, and he was in full power, there was a large, open, full\r\nfield for inquiry; and he was bound to re-institute that inquiry, and to\r\nclear his character before his judges and before his masters. Mr.\r\nHastings says, \"No: they have threatened me with a prosecution, and I\r\nreserve myself for a court of justice.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings has now at length taken a ground, as you will see from all\r\nhis writings, which makes all explanation of his conduct in this\r\nbusiness absolutely impossible. For, in the first place, he says, \"As a\r\nprosecution is meditated against me, I will say nothing in explanation\r\nof my conduct, because I might disclose my defence, and by that means do\r\nmyself a prejudice.\" On the other hand, when the prosecution is dropped,\r\nas we all know it was dropped in this case, then he has a direct\r\ncontrary reason, but it serves him just as well: \"Why, as no prosecution\r\nis intended, no defence need be made.\" So that, whether a prosecution is\r\nintended or a prosecution dropped, there is always cause why Mr.\r\nHastings should not give the Court of Directors the least satisfaction\r\nconcerning his conduct, notwithstanding, as we shall prove, he has\r\nreiteratedly promised, and promised it in the most ample and liberal\r\nmanner. But let us see if there be any presumption in his favor to rebut\r\nthe presumption which he knew was irresistible, and which, by making no\r\ndefence for his conduct, and stopping the inquiry, must necessarily lie\r\nupon him. He reserves his defence, but he promises both defence and\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will remark that there is nowhere a clear and positive\r\ndenial of the fact. Promising a defence, I will admit, does not directly\r\nand _ex vi termini_ suppose that a man may not deny the fact, because it\r\nis just compatible with the defence; but it does by no means exclude the\r\nadmission of the fact, because the admission of the fact may be attended\r\nwith a justification: but when a man says that he will explain his\r\nconduct with regard to a fact, then he admits that fact, because there\r\ncan be no explanation of a fact which has no existence. Therefore Mr.\r\nHastings admits the fact by promising an explanation, and he shows he\r\nhas no explanation nor justification to give by never having given it.\r\nGoaded, provoked, and called upon for it, in the manner I have\r\nmentioned, he chooses to have a feast of disgrace, (if I may say so,) to\r\nhave a riot of infamy, served up to him day by day for a course of\r\nyears, in every species of reproach that could be given by his\r\ncolleagues, and by the Court of Directors, \"from whom,\" he says, \"I\r\nreceived nothing but opprobrious and disgraceful epithets,\" and he says\r\n\"that his predecessors possessed more of their confidence than he had.\"\r\nYet for years he lay down in that sty of disgrace, fattening in it,\r\nfeeding upon that offal of disgrace and excrement, upon everything that\r\ncould be disgustful to the human mind, rather than deny the fact and put\r\nhimself upon a civil justification. Infamy was never incurred for\r\nnothing. We know very well what was said formerly:--\r\n\r\n        \"Populus me sibilat; at mihi plaudo\r\n    Ipse domi, simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.\"\r\n\r\nAnd never did a man submit to infamy for anything but its true reward,\r\n_money_. Money he received; the infamy he received along with it: he was\r\nglad to take his wife with all her goods; he took her with her full\r\nportion, with every species of infamy that belonged to her; and your\r\nLordships cannot resist the opinion that he would not have suffered\r\nhimself to be disgraced with the Court of Directors, disgraced with his\r\ncolleagues, disgraced with the world, disgraced upon an eternal record,\r\nunless he was absolutely guilty of the fact that was charged upon him.\r\n\r\nHe frequently expresses that he reserves himself for a court of justice.\r\nDoes he, my Lords? I am sorry that Mr. Hastings should show that he\r\nalways mistakes his situation; he has totally mistaken it: he was a\r\nservant, bound to give a satisfactory account of his conduct to his\r\nmasters, and, instead of that, he considers himself and the Court of\r\nDirectors as litigant parties,--them as the accusers, and himself as the\r\nculprit. What would your Lordships, in private life, conceive of a\r\nsteward who was accused of embezzling the rents, robbing and oppressing\r\nthe tenants, and committing a thousand misdeeds in his stewardship, and\r\nwho, upon your wishing to make inquiry into his conduct, and asking an\r\nexplanation of it, should answer, \"I will give no reply: you may intend\r\nto prosecute me and convict me as a cheat, and therefore I will not give\r\nyou any satisfaction\": what would you think of that steward? You could\r\nhave no doubt that such a steward was a person not fit to be a steward,\r\nnor fit to live.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings reserves himself for a court of justice: that single\r\ncircumstance, my Lords, proves that he was guilty. It may appear very\r\nodd that his guilt should be inferred from his desire of trial in a\r\ncourt in which he could be acquitted or condemned. But I shall prove to\r\nyou from that circumstance that Mr. Hastings, in desiring to be tried in\r\na court of justice, convicts himself of presumptive guilt.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hastings went to Bengal in the year 1772, he had a direction\r\nexactly similar to this which he has resisted in his own case: it was to\r\ninquire into grievances and abuses. In consequence of this direction, he\r\nproposes a plan for the regulation of the Company's service, and one\r\npart of that plan was just what you would expect from him,--that is, the\r\npower of destroying every Company's servant without the least\r\npossibility of his being heard in his own defence or taking any one\r\nstep to justify himself, and of dismissing him at his own discretion:\r\nand the reason he gives for it is this. \"I shall forbear to comment upon\r\nthe above propositions: if just and proper, their utility will be\r\nself-apparent. One clause only in the last article may require some\r\nexplanation, namely, the power proposed for the Governor of recalling\r\nany person from his station without assigning a reason for it. In the\r\ncharge of oppression,\" (now here you will find the reason why Mr.\r\nHastings wishes to appeal to a court of justice, rather than to give\r\nsatisfaction to his employers,) \"though supported by the cries of the\r\npeople and the most authentic representations, it is yet impossible in\r\nmost cases to obtain legal proofs of it; and unless the discretionary\r\npower which I have recommended be somewhere lodged, the assurance of\r\nimpunity from any formal inquiry will baffle every order of the board,\r\nas, on the other hand, the fear of the consequence will restrain every\r\nman within the bounds of his duty, if he knows himself liable to suffer\r\nby the effects of a single control.\" You see Mr. Hastings himself is of\r\nopinion that the cries of oppression, though extorted from a whole\r\npeople by the iron hand of severity,--that these cries of a whole\r\npeople, attended even with authentic documents sufficient to satisfy the\r\nmind of any man, may be totally insufficient to convict the oppressor in\r\na court; and yet to that court, whose competence he denies, to that very\r\ncourt, he appeals, in that he puts his trust, and upon that ground he\r\nrefuses to perform the just promise he had given of any explanation to\r\nthose who had employed him.\r\n\r\nNow I put this to your Lordships: if a man is of opinion that no public\r\ncourt can truly and properly bring him to any account for his conduct,\r\nthat the forms observable in courts are totally adverse to it, that\r\nthere is a general incompetency with regard to such a court, and yet\r\nshuns a tribunal capable and competent, and applies to that which he\r\nthinks is incapable and incompetent, does not that man plainly show that\r\nhe has rejected what he thinks will prove his guilt, and that he has\r\nchosen what he thinks will be utterly insufficient to prove it? And if\r\nthis be the case, as he asserts it to be, with an under servant, think\r\nwhat must be the case of the upper servant of all: for, if an inferior\r\nservant is not to be brought to justice, what must be the situation of a\r\nGovernor-General? It is impossible not to see, that, as he had conceived\r\nthat a court of justice had not sufficient means to bring his crimes to\r\nlight and detection, nor sufficient to bring him to proper and adequate\r\npunishment, therefore he flew to a court of justice, not as a place to\r\ndecide upon him, but as a sanctuary to secure his guilt. Most of your\r\nLordships have travelled abroad, and have seen in the unreformed\r\ncountries of Europe churches filled with persons who take sanctuary in\r\nthem. You do not presume that a man is innocent because he is in a\r\nsanctuary: you know, that, so far from demonstrating his innocence, it\r\ndemonstrates his guilt. And in this case, Mr. Hastings flies not to a\r\ncourt for trial, but as a sanctuary to secure him from it.\r\n\r\nLet us just review the whole of his conduct; let us hear how Mr.\r\nHastings has proceeded with regard to this whole affair. The court of\r\njustice dropped; the prosecution in Bengal ended. With Sir Elijah Impey\r\nas chief-justice, who, as your Lordships have seen, had a most close and\r\nhonorable connection with the Governor-General, (all the circumstances\r\nof which I need not detail to you, as it must be fresh in your\r\nLordships' memory,) he had not much to fear from the impartiality of the\r\ncourt. He might be sure the forms of law would not be strained to do him\r\nmischief; therefore there was no great terror in it. But whatever terror\r\nthere might be in it was overblown, because his colleagues refused to\r\ncarry him into it, and therefore that opportunity of defence is gone. In\r\nEurope he was afraid of making any defence, but the prosecution here was\r\nalso soon over; and in the House of Commons he takes this ground of\r\njustification for not giving any explanation, that the Court of\r\nDirectors had received perfect satisfaction of his innocence; and he\r\nnamed persons of great and eminent character in the profession, whose\r\nnames certainly cannot be mentioned without highly imposing upon the\r\nprejudices and weighing down almost the reason of mankind. He quotes\r\ntheir opinions in his favor, and argues that the exculpation which they\r\ngive, or are supposed to give him, should excuse him from any further\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I believe I need not say to great men of the profession, many\r\nof the first ornaments of which I see before me, that they are very\r\nlittle influenced in the seat of judgment by the opinions which they\r\nhave given in the chamber, and they are perfectly in the right: because\r\nwhile in the chamber they hear but one part of the cause; it is\r\ngenerally brought before them in a very partial manner, and they have\r\nnot the lights which they possess when they sit deliberately down upon\r\nthe tribunal to examine into it; and for this reason they discharge\r\ntheir minds from every prejudice that may have arisen from a foregone\r\npartial opinion, and come uninfluenced by it as to a new cause. This, we\r\nknow, is the glory of the great lawyers who have presided and do preside\r\nin the tribunals of this country; but we know, at the same time, that\r\nthose opinions (which they in their own mind reject, unless supported\r\nafterwards by clear and authentic testimony) do weigh upon the rest of\r\nmankind at least: for it is impossible to separate the opinion of a\r\ngreat and learned man from some consideration of the person who has\r\ndelivered that opinion.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, being conscious of this, and not fearing the tribunal\r\nabroad for the reason that I gave you, namely, his belief that it was\r\nnot very adverse to him, and also knowing that the prosecution there was\r\ndropped, had but one thing left for his consideration, which was, how he\r\nshould conflict with the tribunal at home: and as the prosecution must\r\noriginate from the Court of Directors, and be authorized by some great\r\nlaw opinions, the great point with him was, some way or other, by his\r\nparty, I will not say by what means or circumstances, but by some party\r\nmeans, to secure a strong interest in the executive part of the India\r\nHouse. My Lords, was that interest used properly and fairly? I will not\r\nsay that friendship and partiality imply injustice; they certainly do\r\nnot; but they do not imply justice. The Court of Directors took up this\r\naffair with great warmth; they committed it to their solicitor, and the\r\nsolicitor would naturally (as most solicitors do) draw up a case a\r\nlittle favorably for the persons that employed him; and if there was any\r\nleaning, which upon my word I do not approve in the management of any\r\ncause whatever, yet, if there was a leaning, it must be a leaning for\r\nthe client.\r\n\r\nNow the counsel did not give a decided opinion against the prosecution,\r\nbut upon the face of the case they expressed great doubts upon it; for,\r\nwith such a strange, disorderly, imperfect, and confused case as was\r\nlaid before them, they could not advise a prosecution; and in my opinion\r\nthey went no further. And, indeed, upon that case that went before them,\r\nI, who am authorized by the Commons to prosecute, do admit that a great\r\ndoubt might lie upon the most deciding mind, whether, under the\r\ncircumstances there stated, a prosecution could be or ought to be\r\npursued. I do not say which way my mind would have turned, upon that\r\nvery imperfect state of the case; but I still allow so much to their\r\nvery great ability, great minds, and sound judgment, that I am not sure,\r\nif it was _res integra_, I would not have rather hesitated myself (who\r\nam now here an accuser) what judgment to give.\r\n\r\nIt does happen that there are very singular circumstances in this\r\nbusiness, to which your Lordships will advert; and you will consider\r\nwhat weight they ought to have upon your Lordships' minds. The person\r\nwho is now the solicitor of the Company is a very respectable man in the\r\nprofession,--Mr. Smith; he was at that time also the Company's\r\nsolicitor, and he has since appeared in this cause as Mr. Hastings's\r\nsolicitor. Now there is something particular in a man's being the\r\nsolicitor to a party who was prosecuting another, and continuing\r\nafterwards in his office, and becoming the solicitor to the party\r\nprosecuted. It would be nearly as strange as if our solicitor were to be\r\nthe solicitor of Mr. Hastings in this prosecution and trial before your\r\nLordships. It is true, that we cannot make out, nor do we attempt to\r\nprove, that Mr. Smith was at that time actually Mr. Hastings's\r\nsolicitor: all that we shall attempt to make out is, that the case he\r\nproduced was just such a case as a solicitor anxious for the\r\npreservation of his client, and not anxious for the prosecution, would\r\nhave made out.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have next to remark, that the opinion which the counsel gave\r\nin this case, namely, a very doubtful opinion, accompanied with strong\r\ncensure of the manner in which the case was stated, was drawn from them\r\nby a case in which I charge that there were _misrepresentation_,\r\n_suppression_, and _falsification_.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, in making this charge I am in a very awkward and\r\nunpleasant situation; but it is a situation in which, with all the\r\ndisagreeable circumstances attending it, I must proceed. I am, in this\r\nbusiness, obliged to name many men: I do not name them wantonly, but\r\nfrom the absolute necessity, as your Lordships will see, of the case. I\r\ndo not mean to reflect upon this gentleman: I believe, at the time when\r\nhe made this case, and especially the article which I state as a\r\n_falsification_, he must have trusted to some of the servants of the\r\nCompany, who were but young in their service at that time. There was a\r\nvery great error committed; but by whom, or how, your Lordships in the\r\ncourse of this inquiry will find. What I charge first is, that the case\r\nwas improperly stated; secondly, that it was partially stated; and that\r\nafterwards a further report was made upon reference to the same officer\r\nin the committee. Now, my Lords, of the three charges which I have made,\r\nthe two former, namely, the misrepresentation and suppression, were\r\napplicable to the case; but all the three, misrepresentation,\r\nsuppression, and falsification, were applicable to the report.\r\n\r\nThis I say in vindication of the opinions given, and for the\r\nsatisfaction of the public, who may be imposed upon by them. I wish the\r\nword to be understood. When I say _imposed_, I always mean by it the\r\nweight and authority carried: a meaning which this word, perhaps, has\r\nnot got yet thoroughly in the English language; but in a neighboring\r\nlanguage _imposing_ means, that it weighs upon men's minds with a\r\nsovereign authority. To say that the opinions of learned men, though\r\neven thus obtained, may not have weight with this court, or with any\r\ncourt, is a kind of compliment I cannot pay to them at the expense of\r\nthat common nature in which I and all human beings are involved.\r\n\r\nHe states in the case the covenants and the salary of Mr. Hastings, and\r\nhis emoluments, very fairly. I do not object to any part of that. He\r\nthen proceeds to state very partially the business upon which the\r\nCommittee of Circuit went, and without opening whose conduct we cannot\r\nfully bring before you this charge of bribery. He then states, \"that, an\r\ninquiry having been made by the present Supreme Council of Bengal\r\nrespecting the conduct of the members of the last administration,\r\nseveral charges have been made, stating moneys very improperly received\r\nby Mr. Hastings during the time of the late administration: amongst\r\nthese is one of his having received 150,000 rupees of Munny Begum, the\r\nguardian of the Nabob, who is an infant.\"\r\n\r\nIn this statement of the case everything is put out of its true place.\r\nMr. Hastings was not charged with receiving a lac and a half of rupees\r\nfrom Munny Begum, the guardian of the Nabob,--for she was not then his\r\nguardian; but he was charged with receiving a lac and a half of rupees\r\nfor removing the Nabob's own mother, who was his natural guardian, and\r\nsubstituting this step-mother, who was a prostitute, in her place;\r\nwhereas here it supposes he found her a guardian, and that she had made\r\nhim a present, which alters the whole nature of the case. The case, in\r\nthe recital of the charge, sets out with what every one of your\r\nLordships knows now not to be the truth of the fact, nor the thing that\r\nin itself implies the criminality: he ought to have stated that in the\r\nbeginning of the business. The suppressions in the recital are amazing.\r\nHe states an inquiry having been made by the Supreme Council of Bengal\r\nrespecting the conduct of the members of the last administration. That\r\ninquiry was made in consequence of the charge, and not the charge\r\nbrought forward, as they would have it believed, in consequence of the\r\ninquiry. There is no mention that that inquiry had been expressly\r\nordered by the Court of Directors; but it is stated as though it was a\r\nvoluntary inquiry. Now there is always something doubtful in voluntary\r\ninquiries with regard to the people concerned. He then supposes, upon\r\nthis inquiry, that to be the charge which is not the charge at all. The\r\ncrime, as I have stated, consisted of two distinct parts, but both\r\ninferring the same corruption: the first, two lac of rupees taken\r\nexpressly for the nomination of this woman to this place; and the other,\r\none lac and a half of rupees, in effect for the same purpose, but under\r\nthe name and color of an entertainment. The drawer of the case, finding\r\nthat in the one case, namely, the two lac of rupees, the evidence was\r\nmore weak, but that no justification could be set up,--finding in the\r\nother, the lac and a half of rupees, the proof strong and not to be\r\nresisted, but that some justification was to be found for it, lays aside\r\nthe charge of the two lac totally; and the evidence belonging to it,\r\nwhich was considered as rather weak, is applied to the other charge of a\r\nlac and a half, the proof of which upon its own evidence was\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nMy speech I hope your Lordships consider as only pointing out to your\r\nattention these particulars. Your Lordships will see it exemplified\r\nthroughout the whole, that, when there is evidence (for some evidence is\r\nbrought) that does belong to the lac and a half, it is entirely passed\r\nby, the most material circumstances are weakened, the whole strength and\r\nforce of them taken away. Every one knows how true it is of evidence,\r\n_juncta juvant_: but here everything is broken and smashed to pieces,\r\nand nothing but disorder appears through the whole. For your Lordships\r\nwill observe that the proof that belongs to one thing is put as\r\nbelonging to another, and the proof of the other brought in a weak and\r\nimperfect manner in the rear of the first, and with every kind of\r\nobservation to rebut and weaken it; and when this evidence is produced,\r\nwhich appears inapplicable almost in all the parts, in many doubtful,\r\nconfused, and perplexed, and in some even contradictory, (which it will\r\nbe when the evidence to one thing is brought to apply and bear upon\r\nanother,) good hopes were entertained in consequence that that would\r\nhappen which in part did happen, namely, that the counsel, distracted\r\nand confused, and finding no satisfaction in the case, could not advise\r\na prosecution.\r\n\r\nBut what is still more material and weighty, many particulars are\r\nsuppressed in this case, and still more in the report; and turning from\r\nthe case to the proceedings of the persons who are supposed to have the\r\nmanagement of the inquiry, they bring forward, as an appendix to this\r\ncase, Mr. Hastings's own invectives and charge against these persons, at\r\nthe very same time that they suppress and do not bring forward, either\r\nin the charge or upon the report, what the other party have said in\r\ntheir own justification. The consequence of this management was, that a\r\nbody of evidence which would have made this case the clearest in the\r\nworld, and which I hope we shall make to appear so to your Lordships,\r\nwas rendered for the most part inapplicable, and the whole puzzled and\r\nconfused: I say, for the most part, for some parts did apply, but\r\nmiserably applied, to the case. From their own state of the case they\r\nwould have it inferred that the fault was not in their way of\r\nrepresenting it, but in the infirmity, confusion, and disorder of the\r\nproofs themselves; but this, I trust we shall satisfy you, is by no\r\nmeans the case. I rest, however, upon the proof of partiality in this\r\nbusiness, of the imposition upon the counsel, whether designed or not,\r\nand of the bias given by adding an appendix with Mr. Hastings's own\r\nremarks upon the case, without giving the reasons of the other parties\r\nfor their conduct. Now, if there was nothing else than the fallacious\r\nrecital, and afterwards the suppression, I believe any rational and\r\nsober man would see perfect, good, and sufficient ground for laying\r\naside any authority that can be derived from the opinions of persons,\r\nthough of the first character (and I am sure no man living does more\r\nhomage to their learning, impartiality, and understanding than I do):\r\nfirst, because the statement of the case has thrown the whole into\r\nconfusion; and secondly, as to the matter added as an appendix, which\r\ngives the representation of the delinquent and omits the representation\r\nof his prosecutors, it is observed very properly and very wisely by one\r\nof the great men before whom this evidence was laid, that \"the evidence,\r\nas it is here stated, is still more defective, if the appendix is\r\nadopted by the Directors and meant to make a part of the case; for that\r\nthrows discredit upon all the information so collected.\" Certainly it\r\ndoes; for, if the delinquent party, who is to be prosecuted, be heard\r\nwith his own representation of the case, and that of his prosecutors be\r\nsuppressed, he is master both of the lawyers and of the mind of mankind.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have here attempted to point out the extreme inconsistencies\r\nand defects of this proceeding; and I wish your Lordships to consider,\r\nwith respect to these proceedings of the India House in their\r\nprosecutions, that it is in the power of some of their officers to make\r\nstatements in the manner that I have described, then to obtain the names\r\nof great lawyers, and under their sanction to carry the accused through\r\nthe world as acquitted.\r\n\r\nThese are the material circumstances which will be submitted to your\r\nLordships' sober consideration in the course of this inquiry. I have now\r\nstated them on these two accounts: first, to rebut the reason which Mr.\r\nHastings has assigned for not giving any satisfaction to the Court of\r\nDirectors, namely, because they did not want it, having dropped a\r\nprosecution upon great authorities and opinions; and next, to show your\r\nLordships how a business begun in bribery is to be supported only by\r\nfraud, deceit, and collusion, and how the receiving of bribes by a\r\nGovernor-General of Bengal tends to taint the whole service from\r\nbeginning to end, both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nBut though upon the partial case that was presented to them these great\r\nlawyers did not advise a prosecution, and though even upon a full\r\nrepresentation of a case a lawyer might think that a man ought not to be\r\nprosecuted, yet he may consider him to be the vilest man upon earth. We\r\nknow men are acquitted in the great tribunals in which several Lords of\r\nthis country have presided, and who perhaps ought not to have been\r\nbrought there and prosecuted before them, and yet about whose\r\ndelinquency there could be no doubt. But though we have here sufficient\r\nreason to justify the great lawyers whose names and authorities are\r\nproduced, yet Mr. Hastings has extended that authority beyond the length\r\nof their opinions. For, being no longer under the terror of the law,\r\nwhich, he said, restrained him from making his defence, he was then\r\nbound to give that satisfaction to his masters and the world which every\r\nman in honor is bound to do, when a grave accusation is brought against\r\nhim. But this business of the law I wish to sleep from this moment, till\r\nthe time when it shall come before you; though I suspect, and have had\r\nreason (sitting in committees in the House of Commons) to believe, that\r\nthere was in the India House a bond of iniquity, somewhere or other,\r\nwhich was able to impose in the first instance upon the solicitor, the\r\nguilt of which, being of another nature, I shall state hereafter, that\r\nyour Lordships may be able to discover through whose means and whose\r\nfraud Mr. Hastings obtained these opinions.\r\n\r\nIf, however, all the great lawyers had been unanimous upon that\r\noccasion, still it would have been necessary for Mr. Hastings to say, \"I\r\ncannot, according to my opinion, be brought to give an account in a\r\ncourt of justice, and I have got great lawyers to declare, that, upon\r\nthe case laid before them, they cannot advise a prosecution; but now is\r\nthe time for me to come forward, and, being no longer in fear that my\r\ndefence may be turned against me, I will produce my defence for the\r\nsatisfaction of my masters and the vindication of my own character.\" But\r\nbesides this doubtful opinion (for I believe your Lordships will find it\r\nno better than a doubtful opinion) given by persons for whom I have the\r\nhighest honor, and given with a strong censure upon the state of the\r\ncase, there were also some great lawyers, men of great authority in the\r\nkingdom, who gave a full and decided opinion that a prosecution ought to\r\nbe instituted against him; but the Court of Directors decided otherwise,\r\nthey overruled those opinions, and acted upon the opinions in favor of\r\nMr. Hastings. When, therefore, he knew that the great men in the law\r\nwere divided upon the propriety of a prosecution, but that the Directors\r\nhad decided in his favor, he was the more strongly bound to enter into a\r\njustification of his conduct.\r\n\r\nBut there was another great reason which should have induced him to do\r\nthis. One great lawyer, known to many of your Lordships, Mr. Sayer, a\r\nvery honest, intelligent man, who had long served the Company and well\r\nknew their affairs, had given an opinion concerning Mr. Hastings's\r\nconduct in stopping these prosecutions. There was an abstract question\r\nput to Mr. Sayer, and other great lawyers, separated from many of the\r\ncircumstances of this business, concerning a point which incidentally\r\narose; and this was, whether Mr. Hastings, as Governor-General, had a\r\npower so to dissolve the Council, that, if he declared it dissolved,\r\nthey could not sit and do any legal and regular act. It was a great\r\nquestion with the lawyers at the time, and there was a difference of\r\nopinion on it. Mr. Sayer was one of those who were inclined to be of\r\nopinion that the Governor-General had a power of dissolving the Council,\r\nand that the Council could not legally sit after such dissolution. But\r\nwhat was his remark upon Mr. Hastings's conduct?--and you must suppose\r\nhis remark of more weight, because, upon the abstract question, he had\r\ngiven his opinion in favor of Mr. Hastings's judgment. \"The meeting of\r\nthe Council depends on the pleasure of the Governor; and I think the\r\nduration of it must do so, too. But it was as great a crime to dissolve\r\nthe Council upon base and sinister motives as it would be to assume the\r\npower of dissolving, if he had it not. I believe he is the first\r\nGovernor that ever dissolved a Council inquiring into his behavior, when\r\nhe was innocent. Before he could summon three Councils and dissolve\r\nthem, he had time fully to consider what would be the result of such\r\nconduct, _to convince everybody, beyond a doubt, of his conscious\r\nguilt_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sayer, then, among other learned people, (and if he had not been the\r\nman that I have described, yet, from his intimate connection with the\r\nCompany, his opinion must be supposed to have great weight,) having used\r\nexpressions as strong as the persons who have ever criminated Mr.\r\nHastings most for the worst of his crimes have ever used to qualify and\r\ndescribe them, and having ascribed his conduct to base and sinister\r\nmotives, he was bound upon that occasion to justify that strong conduct,\r\nallowed to be legal, and charged at the same time to be violent. Mr.\r\nHastings was obliged then to produce something in his justification. He\r\nnever did. Therefore, for all the reasons assigned by himself, drawn\r\nfrom the circumstances of prosecution and non-prosecution, and from\r\nopinions of lawyers and colleagues, the Court of Directors at the same\r\ntime censuring his conduct, and strongly applauding the conduct of those\r\nwho were adverse to him, Mr. Hastings was, I say, from those accumulated\r\ncircumstances, bound to get rid of the infamy of a conduct which could\r\nbe attributed to nothing but base and sinister motives, and which could\r\nhave no effect but to convince men of his consciousness that he was\r\nguilty. From all these circumstances I infer that no man could have\r\nendured this load of infamy, and to this time have given no explanation\r\nof his conduct, unless for the reason which this learned counsel gives,\r\nand which your Lordships and the world will give, namely, his conscious\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving upon your minds that presumption, not to operate without\r\nproof, but to operate along with the proof, (though, I take it, there\r\nare some presumptions that go the full length of proof,) I shall not\r\npress it to the length to which I think it would go, but use it only as\r\nauxiliary, assisting, and compurgatory of all the other evidences that\r\ngo along with it.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance which must come before your Lordships in\r\nthis business. If you find that Mr. Hastings has received the two lac of\r\nrupees, then you will find that he was guilty, without color or pretext\r\nof any kind whatever, of acting in violation of his covenant, of acting\r\nin violation of the laws, and all the rules of honor and conscience. If\r\nyou find that he has taken the lac and a half, which he admits, but\r\nwhich he justifies under the pretence of an entertainment, I shall beg\r\nto say something to your Lordships concerning that justification.\r\n\r\nThe justification set up is, that he went up from Calcutta to\r\nMoorshedabad, and paid a visit of three months, and that there an\r\nallowance was made to him of two hundred pounds a day in lieu of an\r\nentertainment. Now, my Lords, I leave it to you to determine, if there\r\nwas such a custom, whether or no his covenant justifies his conformity\r\nwith it. I remember Lord Coke, talking of the Brehon law in Ireland,\r\nsays it is no law, but a lewd custom. A governor is to conform himself\r\nto the laws of his own country, to the stipulations of those that employ\r\nhim, and not to the lewd customs of any other country: those customs are\r\nmore honored in the breach than in the observance. If Mr. Hastings was\r\nreally feasted and entertained with the magnificence of the country, if\r\nthere was an entertainment of dancing-girls brought out to amuse him in\r\nhis leisure hours, if he was feasted with the hookah and every other\r\nluxury, there is something to be said for him, though I should not\r\njustify a Governor-General wasting his days in that manner. But in fact\r\nhere was no entertainment that could amount to such a sum; and he has\r\nnowhere proved the existence of such a custom.\r\n\r\nBut if such a custom did exist, which I contend is more honored in the\r\nbreach than in the observance, that custom is capable of being abused to\r\nthe grossest extortion; and that it was so abused will strike your\r\nLordships' minds in such a manner that I hardly need detail the\r\ncircumstances of it. What! two hundred pounds to be given to a man for\r\none day's entertainment? If there is an end of it there, it ruins\r\nnobody, and cannot be supposed, to a great degree, to corrupt anybody;\r\nbut when that entertainment is renewed day after day for three months,\r\nit is no longer a compliment to the man, but a great pecuniary\r\nadvantage, and, on the other hand, to the person giving it, a grievous,\r\nan intolerable burden. It then becomes a matter of the most serious and\r\ndreadful extortion, tending to hinder the people who give it not only\r\nfrom giving entertainment, but from having bread to eat themselves.\r\nTherefore, if any such entertainment was customary, the custom was\r\nperverted by the abuse of its being continued for three months together.\r\nIt was longer than Ahasuerus's feast. There is a feast of reason and a\r\nflow of soul; but Mr. Hastings's feast was a feast of avarice and a flow\r\nof money. No wonder he was unwilling to rise from such a table: he\r\ncontinued to sit at that table for three months.\r\n\r\nIn his covenant he is forbidden expressly to take any allowance above\r\n400_l._, and forbidden to take any allowance above 100_l._, without the\r\nknowledge, consent, and approbation of the Council to which he belongs.\r\nNow he takes 16,000_l._, not only without the consent of the Council,\r\nbut without their knowledge,--without the knowledge of any other human\r\nbeing: it is kept hid in the darkest and most secret recesses of his own\r\nblack agents and confidants, and those of Munny Begum. Why is it a\r\nsecret? Hospitality, generosity, virtues of that kind, are full of\r\ndisplay; there is an ostentation, a pomp, in them; they want to be shown\r\nto the world, not concealed. The concealment of acts of charity is what\r\nmakes them acceptable in the eyes of Him with regard to whom there can\r\nbe no concealment; but acts of corruption are kept secret, not to keep\r\nthem secret from the eye of Him, whom the person that observes the\r\nsecrecy does not fear, nor perhaps believe in, but to keep them secret\r\nfrom the eyes of mankind, whose opinions he does fear, in the immediate\r\neffect of them, and in their future consequences. Therefore he had but\r\none reason to keep this so dark and profound a secret, till it was\r\ndragged into day in spite of him; he had no reason to keep it a secret,\r\nbut his knowing it was a proceeding that could not bear the light.\r\nCharity is the only virtue that I ever heard of that derives from its\r\nretirement any part of its lustre; the others require to be spread\r\nabroad in the face of day. Such candles should not be hid under a\r\nbushel, and, like the illuminations which men light up when they mean to\r\nexpress great joy and great magnificence for a great event, their very\r\nsplendor is a part of their excellence. We upon our feasts light up this\r\nwhole capital city; we in our feasts invite all the world to partake\r\nthem. Mr. Hastings feasts in the dark; Mr. Hastings feasts alone; Mr.\r\nHastings feasts like a wild beast; he growls in the corner over the\r\ndying and the dead, like the tigers of that country, who drag their prey\r\ninto the jungles. Nobody knows of it, till he is brought into judgment\r\nfor the flock he has destroyed. His is the entertainment of Tantalus; it\r\nis an entertainment from which the sun hid his light.\r\n\r\nBut was it an entertainment upon a visit? Was Mr. Hastings upon a visit?\r\nNo: he was executing a commission for the Company in a village in the\r\nneighborhood of Moorshedabad, and by no means upon a visit to the Nabob.\r\nOn the contrary, he was upon something that might be more properly\r\ncalled a _visitation_. He came as a heavy calamity, like a famine or a\r\npestilence on a country; he came there to do the severest act in the\r\nworld,--as he himself expresses, to take the bread, literally the bread,\r\nfrom above a thousand of the nobles of the country, and to reduce them\r\nto a situation which no man can hear of without shuddering. When you\r\nconsider, that, while he was thus entertained himself, he was famishing\r\nfourteen hundred of the nobility and gentry of the country, you will not\r\nconceive it to be any extenuation of his crimes, that he was there, not\r\nupon a visit, but upon a duty, the harshest that could be executed, both\r\nto the persons who executed and the people who suffered from it.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned and supposed in the observations upon this case, though\r\nno circumstances relative to the persons or the nature of the visit are\r\nstated, that this expense was something which he might have charged to\r\nthe Company and did not. It is first supposed by the learned counsel who\r\nmade the observation, that it was a public, allowed, and acknowledged\r\nthing; then, that he had not charged the Company anything for it. I have\r\nlooked into that business. In the first place, I see no such custom; and\r\nif there was such a custom, there was the most abusive misemployment of\r\nit. I find that in that year there was paid from the Company's cash\r\naccount to the Governor's travelling charges (and he had no other\r\njourney at that end of the year) thirty thousand rupees, which is about\r\n3,000_l._; and when we consider that he was in the receipt of near\r\n30,000_l._, besides the nuzzers, which amount to several thousand a\r\nyear, and that he is allowed 3,000_l._ by the Company for his travelling\r\nexpenses, is it right to charge upon the miserable people whom he was\r\ndefrauding of their bread 16,000_l._ for his entertainment?\r\n\r\nI find that there are also other great sums relative to the expenses of\r\nthe Committee of Circuit, which he was upon. How much of them is\r\napplicable to him I know not. I say, that the allowance of three\r\nthousand pounds was noble and liberal; for it is not above a day or\r\ntwo's journey to Moorshedabad, and by his taking his road by Kishenagur\r\nhe could not be longer. He had a salary to live upon, and he must live\r\nsomewhere; and he was actually paid three thousand pounds for travelling\r\ncharges for three months, which was at the rate of twelve thousand\r\npounds a year: a large and abundant sum.\r\n\r\nIf you once admit that a man for an entertainment shall take sixteen\r\nthousand pounds, there never will be any bribe, any corruption, that may\r\nnot be justified: the corrupt man has nothing to do but to make a visit,\r\nand then that very moment he may receive any sum under the name of this\r\nentertainment; that moment his covenants are annulled, his bonds and\r\nobligations destroyed, the act of Parliament repealed, and it is no\r\nlonger bribery, it is no longer corruption, it is no longer peculation;\r\nit is nothing but thanks for obliging inquiries, and a compliment\r\naccording to the mode of the country, by which he makes his fortune.\r\n\r\nWhat hinders him from renewing that visit? If you support this\r\ndistinction, you will teach the Governor-General, instead of attending\r\nhis business at the capital, to make journeys through the country,\r\nputting every great man of that country under the most ruinous\r\ncontributions; and as this custom is in no manner confined to the\r\nGovernor-General, but extends, as it must upon that principle, to every\r\nservant of the Company in any station whatever, then, if each of them\r\nwere to receive an entertainment, I will venture to say that the\r\ngreatest ravage of an hostile army could not, indeed, destroy the\r\ncountry more entirely than the Company's servants by such visits.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will see that there are grounds for suspicion, not\r\nsupported with the same evidence, but with evidence of great\r\nprobability, that there was another entertainment given at the expense\r\nof another lac of rupees; and there is also great probability that Mr.\r\nHastings received two lac of rupees, and Mr. Middleton another lac. The\r\nwhole of the Nabob's revenues would have been exhausted by these two\r\nmen, if they had stayed there a whole year: and they stayed three\r\nmonths. Nothing will be secured from the Company's servants, so long as\r\nthey can find, under this name, or under pretence of any corrupt custom\r\nof the country, a vicious excuse for this corrupt practice. The excuse\r\nis worse than the thing itself. I leave it, then, with your judgment to\r\ndecide whether you will or not, if this justification comes before you,\r\nestablish a principle which would put all Bengal in a worse situation\r\nthan an hostile army could do, and ruin all the Company's servants by\r\nsending them from their duty to go round robbing the whole country under\r\nthe name of entertainments.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have now done with this first part,--namely, the presumption\r\narising from his refusal to make any defence, on pretence that the\r\ncharge brought against him might be referred to a court of justice, and\r\nfrom the non-performance of his promise to give satisfaction to his\r\nemployers,--and when that pretence was removed, still refusing to give\r\nthat satisfaction, though suffering as he did under a load of infamy and\r\nobloquy, and though urged to give it by persons of the greatest\r\ncharacter. I have stated this to your Lordships as the strongest\r\npresumption of guilt, and that this presumption is strengthened by the\r\nvery excuse which he fabricated for a part of his bribes, when he knew\r\nthat the proof of them was irresistible, and that this excuse is a high\r\naggravation of his guilt,--that this excuse is not supported by law,\r\nthat it is not supported by reason, that it does not stand with his\r\ncovenant, but carries with it a manifest proof of corruption, and that\r\nit cannot be justified by any principle, custom, or usage whatever. My\r\nLords, I say I have done with the presumption arising from his conduct\r\nas it regarded the fact specifically charged against him, and with\r\nrespect to the relation he stood in to the Court of Directors, and from\r\nthe attempt he made to justify that conduct. I believe your Lordships\r\nwill think both one and the other strong presumptions of his\r\ncriminality, and of his knowledge that the act he was doing was\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nI have another fact to lay before your Lordships, which affords a\r\nfurther presumption of his guilt, and which will show the mischievous\r\nconsequences of it; and I trust your Lordships will not blame me for\r\ngoing a little into it. Your Lordships know we charge that the\r\nappointment of such a woman as Munny Begum to the guardianship of the\r\nNabob, to the superintendency of the civil justice of the country, and\r\nto the representation of the whole government, was made for no other\r\npurpose than that through this corrupt woman sixteen thousand pounds a\r\nyear, the whole tattered remains of the Nabob's grandeur, might be a\r\nprey to Mr. Hastings: it could be for no other. Now your Lordships would\r\nimagine, that, after this, knowing he was already grievously suspected,\r\nhe would have abstained from giving any further ground for suspicion by\r\na repetition of the same acts through the same person; as no other\r\nreason could be furnished for such acts, done directly contrary to the\r\norder of his superiors, but that he was actuated by the influence of\r\nbribery. Your Lordships would imagine, that, when this Munny Begum was\r\nremoved upon a charge of corruption, Mr. Hastings would have left her\r\nquiet in tranquil obscurity, and that he would no longer have attempted\r\nto elevate her into a situation which furnished against himself so much\r\ndisgrace and obloquy to himself, and concerning which he stood charged\r\nwith a direct and positive act of bribery. Your Lordships well know,\r\nthat, upon the deposition of that great magistrate, Mahomed Reza Khân,\r\nthis woman was appointed to supply his place. The Governor-General and\r\nCouncil (the majority of them being then Sir John Clavering, Colonel\r\nMonson, and Mr. Francis) had made a provisional arrangement for the\r\ntime, until they should be authorized to fill up the place in a proper\r\nmanner. Soon after, there came from Europe a letter expressing the\r\nsatisfaction which the Court of Directors had received in the acquittal\r\nof Mahomed Reza Khân, expressing a regard for his character, an high\r\nopinion of his abilities, and a great disposition to make him some\r\nrecompense for his extreme sufferings; and accordingly they ordered\r\nthat he should be again employed. Having no exact ideas of the state of\r\nemployments in that country, they made a mistake in the specific\r\nemployment for which they named him; for, being a Mahometan, and the\r\nhead of the Mahometans in that country, he was named to an office which\r\nmust be held by a Gentoo. But the majority I have just named, who never\r\nendeavored by any base and delusive means to fly from their duty, or not\r\nto execute it at all, because they were desired to execute it in a way\r\nin which they could not execute it, followed the spirit of the order;\r\nand finding that Mahomed Reza Khân, before his imprisonment and trial,\r\nhad been in possession of another employment, they followed the spirit\r\nof the instructions of the Directors and replaced him in that\r\nemployment: by which means there was an end put to the government of\r\nMunny Begum, the country reverted to its natural state, and men of the\r\nfirst rank in the country were placed in the first situations in it. The\r\nseat of judicature was filled with wisdom, gravity, and learning, and\r\nMunny Begum sunk into that situation into which a woman who had been\r\nengaged in the practices that she had been engaged in naturally would\r\nsink at her time of life. Mr. Hastings resisted this appointment. He\r\ntrifled with the Company's orders on account of the letter of them, and\r\nendeavored to disobey the spirit of them. However, the majority overbore\r\nhim; they put Mahomed Reza Khân into his former situation; and as a\r\nproof and seal to the honor and virtue of their character, there was not\r\na breath of suspicion that they had any corrupt motive for this conduct.\r\nThey were odious to many of the India House here; they were odious to\r\nthat corrupt influence which had begun and was going on to ruin India;\r\nbut in the face of all this odium, they gave the appointment to Mahomed\r\nReza Khân, because the act contained in itself its own justification.\r\nMr. Hastings made a violent protest against it, and resisted it to the\r\nbest of his power, always in favor of Munny Begum, as your Lordships\r\nwill see. Mr. Hastings sent this protest to the Directors; but the\r\nDirectors, as soon as the case came before them, acknowledged their\r\nerror, and praised the majority of the Council, Sir John Clavering,\r\nColonel Monson, and Mr. Francis, for the wise and honorable part they\r\nhad taken upon the occasion, by obeying the spirit and not the\r\nletter,--commended the act they had done,--confirmed Mahomed Reza Khân\r\nin his place,--and to prevent that great man from being any longer the\r\nsport of fortune, any longer the play of avarice between corrupt\r\ngovernors and dancing-girls, they gave him the pledged faith of the\r\nCompany that he should remain in that office as long as his conduct\r\ndeserved their protection: it was a good and an honorable tenure. My\r\nLords, soon afterwards there happened two lamentable deaths,--first of\r\nColonel Monson, afterwards of General Clavering. Thus Mr. Hastings was\r\nset loose: there was an inspection and a watch upon his conduct, and no\r\nmore. He was then just in the same situation in which he had stood in\r\n1772. What does he do? Even just what he did in 1772. He deposes Mahomed\r\nReza Khân, notwithstanding the Company's orders, notwithstanding their\r\npledged faith; he turns him out, and makes a distribution of two lacs\r\nand a half of rupees, the salary of that great magistrate, in the manner\r\nI will now show your Lordships. He made an arrangement consisting of\r\nthree main parts: the first was with regard to the women, the next with\r\nregard to the magistracy, the last with regard to the officers of state\r\nof the household.\r\n\r\nThe first person that occurred to Mr. Hastings was Munny Begum; and he\r\ngave her, not out of that part of the Nabob's allowance which was to\r\nsupport the seraglio, but out of the allowance of this very magistrate,\r\njust as if such a thing had been done here out of the salary of a Lord\r\nChancellor or a Lord Chief-Justice,--out of these two lacs and a half of\r\nrupees, that is, about twenty-four or twenty-five thousand pounds a\r\nyear, he ordered an allowance to be made to Munny Begum of 72,000 rupees\r\nper annum, or 7,200_l._ a year; for the Nabob's own mother, whom he\r\nthrust, as usual, into a subordinate situation, he made an allowance of\r\n3,000_l._; to the Sudder ul Huk Khân, which is, translated into English,\r\nthe Lord Chief-Justice, he allowed the same sum that he did to the\r\ndancing-girl, (which was very liberal in him, and I am rather astonished\r\nto find it,) namely, 7,200_l._ a year. And who do you think was the next\r\npublic officer he appointed? It was the Rajah Gourdas, the son of\r\nNundcomar, and whose testimony he has attempted both before and since\r\nthis occasion to weaken. To him, however, he gave an employment of\r\n6,000_l._ a year, as if to make through the son some compensation to the\r\nmanes of the father. And in this manner he distributes, with a wild and\r\nliberal profusion, between magistrates and dancing-girls, the whole\r\nspoil of Mahomed Reza Khân, notwithstanding the Company's direct and\r\npositive assurance given to him. Everything was done, at the same time,\r\nto put, as it was before, into the hands of this dancing-girl the\r\nmiserable Nabob's whole family; and that the fund for corruption might\r\nbe large enough, he did not take the money for this dancing-girl out of\r\nthe Nabob's separate revenue, of which he and the dancing-girl had the\r\nprivate disposal between them.\r\n\r\nNow upon what pretence did he do all this? The Nabob had represented to\r\nMr. Hastings that he was now of age,--that he was an independent,\r\nsovereign prince,--that, being independent and sovereign in his\r\nsituation, and being of full age, he had a right to manage his own\r\nconcerns himself; and therefore he desired to be admitted to that\r\nmanagement. And, indeed, my Lords, ostensibly, and supposing him to have\r\nbeen this independent prince, and that the Company had no authority or\r\nhad never exercised any authority over him through Mr. Hastings, there\r\nmight be a good deal said in favor of this request. But what was the\r\nreal state of the case? The Nabob was a puppet in the hands of Mr.\r\nHastings and Munny Begum; and you will find, upon producing the\r\ncorrespondence, that he confesses that she was the ultimate object and\r\nend of this request.\r\n\r\nI think this correspondence, wherein a son is made to petition, in his\r\nown name, for the elevation of a dancing-girl, his step-mother, above\r\nhimself and everybody else, will appear to your Lordships such a\r\ncuriosity as, I believe, is not to be found in the state correspondence\r\nof the whole world. The Nabob begins thus:--\"The excellency of that\r\npolicy by which her Highness the Begum\" (meaning Munny Begum) \"(may her\r\nshadow be far extended!) formerly, during the time of her\r\nadministration, transacted the affairs of the nizamut in the very best\r\nand most advantageous manner, was, by means of the delusions of enemies\r\ndisguised under the appearance of friends, hidden from me. Having lately\r\nseriously reflected on my own affairs, I am convinced that it was the\r\neffect of maternal affection, was highly proper, and for my\r\ninterest,--and that, except the said Begum is again invested with the\r\nadministration, the regulation and prosperity of this family, which is\r\nin fact her own, cannot be effected. For this cause, from the time of\r\nher suspension until now, I have passed my time, and do so still, in\r\ngreat trouble and uneasiness. As all affairs, and particularly the\r\nhappiness and prosperity of this family, depend on your pleasure, I now\r\ntrouble you, in hopes that you, likewise concurring in this point, will\r\nbe so kind as to write in fit and proper terms to her Highness the\r\nBegum, that she will always, as formerly, employ her authority in the\r\nadministration of the nizamut and the affairs of this family.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter, my Lords, was received upon the 23d of August; and your\r\nLordships may observe two things in it: first, that, some way or other,\r\nthis Nabob had been (as the fact was) made to express his desire of\r\nbeing released from his subjection to the Munny Begum, but that now he\r\nhas got new lights, all the mists are gone, and he now finds that Munny\r\nBegum is not only the fittest person to govern him, but the whole\r\ncountry. This young man, whose incapacity is stated, and never denied,\r\nby Mr. Hastings, and by Lord Cornwallis, and by all the rest of the\r\nworld who know him, begins to be charmed with the excellency of the\r\npolicy of Munny Begum. Such is his violent impatience, such the\r\nimpossibility of his existing an hour but under the government of Munny\r\nBegum, that he writes again on the 25th of August, (he had really the\r\nimpatience of a lover,) and within five days afterwards writes\r\nagain,--so impatient, so anxious and jealous is this young man to be put\r\nunder the government of an old dancing-woman. He is afraid lest Mr.\r\nHastings should imagine that some sinister influence had prevailed upon\r\nhim in so natural and proper a request. He says, \"Knowing it for my\r\ninterest and advantage that the administration of the affairs of the\r\nnizamut should be restored to her Highness the Munny Begum, I have\r\nalready troubled you with my request, that, regarding my situation with\r\nan eye of favor, you will approve of this measure. I am credibly\r\ninformed that some one of my enemies, from selfish views, has, for the\r\npurpose of oversetting this measure, written you that the said Begum\r\nprocured from me by artifice the letter I wrote you on this subject.\r\nThis causes me the greatest astonishment. Please to consider, that\r\nartifice and delusion are confined to cheats and impostors, and can\r\nnever proceed from a person of such exalted rank, who is the head and\r\npatron of all the family of the deceased Nabob, my father,--and that to\r\nbe deluded, being a proof of weakness and folly, can have no relation to\r\nme, except the inventor of this report considers me as void of\r\nunderstanding, and has represented me to the gentlemen as a blockhead\r\nand an idiot. God knows how harshly such expressions appear to me; but,\r\nas the truth or falsehood has not yet been fully ascertained, I have\r\ntherefore suspended my demand of satisfaction. Should it be true, be so\r\nkind as to inform me of it, that the person may be made to answer for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here is a very proper demand. The Nabob is astonished at the\r\nsuspicion, that such a woman as Munny Begum, whose trade in youth had\r\nbeen delusion, should be capable of deluding anybody. Astonishing it\r\ncertainly was, that a woman who had been a deluder in youth should be\r\nsuspected to be the same in old age, and that he, a young man, should be\r\nsubject to her artifices. \"They must suspect me to be a great\r\nblockhead,\" he says, \"if a man of my rank is to be deluded.\" There he\r\nforgot that it is the unhappy privilege of great men to be cheated, to\r\nbe deluded, much more than other persons; but he thought it so\r\nimpossible in the case of Munny Begum, that he says, \"Produce me the\r\ntraitor that could suppose it possible for me to be deluded, when I call\r\nfor this woman as the governor of the country. I demand satisfaction.\" I\r\nrather wonder that Mr. Hastings did not inform him who it was that had\r\nreported so gross and improbable a tale, and deliver him up to the fury\r\nof the Nabob.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings is absolutely besieged by him; for he receives another\r\nletter upon the 3d of September. Here are four letters following one\r\nanother quick as post expresses with horns sounding before them. \"Oh, I\r\ndie, I perish, I sink, if Munny Begum is not put into the government of\r\nthe country!--I therefore desire to have her put into the government of\r\nthe country, and that you will not keep me longer in this painful\r\nsuspense, but will be kindly pleased to write immediately to the Munny\r\nBegum, that she take on herself the administration of the affairs of the\r\nnizamut, which is, in fact, her own family, without the interference of\r\nany other person whatever: by this you will give me complete\r\nsatisfaction.\" Here is a correspondence more like an amorous than a\r\nstate correspondence. What is this man so eager about, what in such a\r\nrage about, that he cannot endure the smallest delay of the post with\r\ncommon patience? Why, lest this old woman (who is not his mother, and\r\nwith whom he had no other tie of blood) should not be made mistress of\r\nhimself and the whole country! However, in a very few months afterwards\r\nhe himself is appointed by Mr. Hastings to the government; and you may\r\neasily judge by the preceding letters who was to govern. It would be an\r\naffront to your Lordships' judgment to attempt to prove who was to\r\ngovern, after he had desired to put the whole government of affairs into\r\nthe hands of Munny Begum.\r\n\r\nNow, Munny Begum having obtained this salary, and being invested with\r\nthis authority, and made in effect the total and entire governor of the\r\ncountry, as I have proved by the Nabob's letters, let us see the\r\nconsequences of it; and then I desire to know whether your Lordships can\r\nbelieve that in all this haste, which, in fact, is Mr. Hastings's haste\r\nand impatience, (for we shall prove that the Nabob never did or could\r\ntake a step but by his immediate orders and directions,)--whether your\r\nLordships can believe that Mr. Hastings would incur all the odium\r\nattending such transactions, unless he had some corrupt consideration.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, very soon after these appointments were made, consisting of\r\nMunny Begum at the head of the affairs, the Lord Chief-Justice under\r\nher, and under her direction, and Rajah Gourdas as steward of the\r\nhousehold, the first thing we hear is, just what your Lordships expect\r\nto hear upon such a case, that this unfortunate chief-justice, who was a\r\nman undoubtedly of but a poor, low disposition, but, I believe, a\r\nperfectly honest, perfectly well-intentioned man, found it absolutely\r\nimpossible for him to execute his office under the direction of Munny\r\nBegum; and accordingly, in the month of September following, he sends a\r\ncomplaint to Mr. Hastings, \"that certain bad men had gained an\r\nascendency over the Nabob's temper, by whose instigation he acts.\" After\r\ncomplaining of the slights he receives from the Nabob, he adds, \"Thus\r\nthey cause the Nabob to treat me, sometimes with indignity, at others\r\nwith kindness, just as they think proper to advise him: their view is,\r\nthat, by compelling me to displeasure at such unworthy treatment, they\r\nmay force me either to relinquish my station, or to join with them, and\r\nact by their advice, and appoint creatures of their recommendation to\r\nthe different offices, from which they might draw profit to themselves.\"\r\nThis is followed by another letter, in which he shows who those corrupt\r\nmen were that had gained the ascendency over the Nabob's\r\ntemper,--namely, the eunuchs of Munny Begum: one of them her direct\r\ninstrument in bribery with Mr. Hastings. What you would expect from such\r\na state of things accordingly happened. Everything in the course of\r\njustice was confounded; all official responsibility destroyed; and\r\nnothing but a scene of forgery, peculation, and knavery of every kind\r\nand description prevailed through the country, and totally disturbed all\r\norder and justice in it. He says, \"The Begum's ministers, before my\r\narrival, with the advice of their counsellors, caused the Nabob to sign\r\na receipt, in consequence of which they received at two different times\r\nnear fifty thousand rupees, in the name of the officers of the Adawlut,\r\nFoujdarry, &c., from the Company's circar; and having drawn up an\r\naccount-current in the manner they wished, they got the Nabob to sign\r\nit, and then sent it to me.\" In the same letter he asserts \"that these\r\npeople have the Nabob entirely in their power.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see here Mr. Hastings enabling the corrupt eunuchs of this\r\nwicked old woman to draw upon the Company's treasury at their pleasure,\r\nunder forged papers of the Nabob, for just such moneys as they please,\r\nunder the name and pretence of giving it to the officers of justice, but\r\nwhich they distribute among themselves as they think fit. This complaint\r\nwas soon followed by another, and they furnish, first, the strongest\r\npresumptive proof of the corrupt motives of Mr. Hastings; and, secondly,\r\nthey show the horrible mischievous effects of his conduct upon the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the first complaint, Mr. Hastings directs this\r\nindependent Nabob not to concern himself any longer with the Foujdarry.\r\nThe Nabob, who had before declared that the superintendence of all the\r\noffices belonged to him, and was to be executed by himself, or under his\r\norders, instantly obeys Mr. Hastings, and declares he will not interfere\r\nin the business of the courts any more. Your Lordships will observe\r\nfurther that the complaint is not against the Nabob, but against the\r\ncreatures and the menial servants of Munny Begum: and yet it is the\r\nNabob he forbids to interfere in this business; of the others he takes\r\nno notice; and this is a strong proof of the corrupt dealings of Mr.\r\nHastings with this woman. When the whole country was fallen into\r\nconfusion under the administration of this woman, and under her corrupt\r\nministers, men base-born and employed in the basest offices, (the men of\r\nthe household train of the women of rank in that country are of that\r\ndescription,) he writes to the Nabob again, and himself confesses the\r\nmischiefs that had arisen from his corrupt arrangements.\r\n\r\n\"At your Excellency's request, I sent Sudder ul Huk Khân to take on him\r\nthe administration of the affairs of the Adawlut and Foujdarry, and\r\nhoped by that means not only to have given satisfaction to your\r\nExcellency, but that through his abilities and experience these affairs\r\nwould have been conducted in such manner as to have secured the peace of\r\nthe country and the happiness of the people; and it is with the greatest\r\nconcern I learn that this measure is so far from being attended with the\r\nexpected advantages, that the affairs both of the Foujdarry and Adawlut\r\nare in the greatest confusion imaginable, and daily robberies and\r\nmurders are perpetrated throughout the country. This is evidently owing\r\nto the want of a proper authority in the person appointed to superintend\r\nthem. I therefore addressed your Excellency on the importance and\r\ndelicacy of the affairs in question, and of the necessity of lodging\r\nfull power in the hands of the person chosen to administer them. In\r\nreply to which your Excellency expressed sentiments coincident with\r\nmine. Notwithstanding which, your dependants and people, actuated by\r\nselfish and avaricious views, have by their interference so impeded the\r\nbusiness as to throw the whole country into a state of confusion, from\r\nwhich nothing can retrieve it but an unlimited power lodged in the hands\r\nof the superintendent. I therefore request that your Excellency will\r\ngive the strictest injunctions to all your dependants not to interfere\r\nin any manner with any matter relative to the affairs of the Adawlut and\r\nFoujdarry, and that you will yourself relinquish all interference\r\ntherein, and leave them entirely to the management of Sudder ul Huk\r\nKhân. This is absolutely necessary to restore the country to a state of\r\ntranquillity.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, what evidence do we produce to your Lordships of the\r\nconsequences of Mr. Hastings's corrupt measures? His own. He here gives\r\nyou the state into which the country was thrown by the criminal\r\ninterference of the wicked woman whom he had established in power,\r\ntotally superseding the regular judicial authority of the country, and\r\nthrowing everything into confusion. As usual, there is such irregularity\r\nin his conduct, and his crimes are so multiplied, that all the\r\ncontrivances of ingenuity are unable to cover them. Now and then he\r\ncomes and betrays himself; and here he confesses you his own weakness,\r\nand the effects of his own corruption: he had appointed Munny Begum to\r\nthis office of power, he dare not say a word to her upon her abuse of\r\nit, but he lays the whole upon the Nabob. When the Chief-Justice\r\ncomplains that these crimes were the consequence of Munny Begum's\r\ninterference, and were committed by her creatures, why did he not say to\r\nthe Nabob, \"The Begum must not interfere; the Begum's eunuchs must not\r\ninterfere\"? He dared not: because that woman had concealed all the\r\nbribes but one from public notice to gratify him; she and Yatibar Ali\r\nKhân, her minister, who had the principal share in this destruction of\r\njustice and perversion of all the principal functions of government, had\r\nit in their power to discover the whole. Mr. Hastings was obliged, in\r\nconsequence of that concealment, to support her and to support him.\r\nEvery evil principle was at work. He bought a mercenary silence to pay\r\nthe same back to them. It was a wicked silence, the concealment of their\r\ncommon guilt. There was at once a corrupt gratitude operating mutually\r\nby a corrupt influence on both, and a corrupt fear influencing the mind\r\nof Mr. Hastings, which did not permit him to put an end to this scene of\r\ndisorder and confusion, bought at the expense of twenty-four thousand\r\npounds a year to the Company. You will hereafter see what use he makes\r\nof the evidence of Yatibar Ali Khân, and of this woman, for concealing\r\ntheir guilt.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will observe that the virtuous majority, whose reign was\r\nbut short, and two of whom died of grief and vexation under the\r\nimpediments which they met with from the corruptions and oppositions of\r\nMr. Hastings, (their indirect murderer,--for it is well known to the\r\nworld that their hearts were thus broken,) put their conduct out of all\r\nsuspicion. For they ordered an exact account to be kept by Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân,--though, certainly, if any person in the country could be trusted,\r\nhe, upon his character, might; but they did not trust him, because they\r\nknew the Company did not suffer them to trust any man: they ordered an\r\nexact account to be kept by him of the Nabob's expenses, which finally\r\nmust be the Company's expenses; they ordered the account to be sent down\r\nyearly, to be controlled, if necessary, whilst the means of control\r\nexisted.--What was Mr. Hastings's conduct? He did not give the persons\r\nwhom he appointed any order to produce any account, though their\r\ncharacter and circumstances were such as made an account ten thousand\r\ntimes more necessary from them than from those from whom it had been in\r\nformer times by the Company strictly exacted. So that his not ordering\r\nany account to be given of the money that was to be expended leaves no\r\ndoubt that the appointment of Munny Begum was in pursuance of his old\r\nsystem of bribery, and that he maintained her in office, to the\r\nsubversion of public justice, for the purpose of robbing, and of\r\ncontinuing in the practice of robbing, the country.\r\n\r\nBut though this continued longer than was for the good of the country,\r\nyet it did not continue absolutely and relatively long; because the\r\nCourt of Directors, as soon as they heard of this iniquitous\r\nappointment, which glared upon them in all the light of its infamy,\r\nimmediately wrote the strongest, the most decided, and the most\r\nperemptory censure upon him, attributing his acts, every one of them, to\r\nthe same causes to which I attribute them. As a proof that the Court of\r\nDirectors saw the thing in the very light in which I represent it to\r\nyour Lordships, and indeed in which every one must see it, you will find\r\nthat they reprobate all his idle excuses,--that they reprobate all the\r\nactors in the scene,--that they consider everything to have been done,\r\nnot by the Nabob, but by himself,--that the object of the appointment of\r\nMunny Begum was _money_, and that the consequence of that appointment\r\nwas the robbery of the Nabob's treasury. \"We by no means approve your\r\nlate proceedings, on the application of the Nabob Mobarek ul Dowlah for\r\nthe removal of the Naib Subahdar. The requisition of Mobarek ul Dowlah\r\nwas improper and unfriendly; because he must have known that the late\r\nappointment of Mahomed Reza Khân to the office of Naib Subahdar had been\r\nmarked with the Company's special approbation, and that the Court of\r\nDirectors had assured him of their favor so long as a firm attachment\r\nto the Company's interest and a proper discharge of the duties of his\r\nstation should render him worthy of their protection. We therefore\r\nrepeat our declaration, that to require the dismission of a\r\nprime-minister thus circumstanced, without producing the smallest proof\r\nof his infidelity to the Company, or venturing to charge him with one\r\ninstance of maladministration in the discharge of his public duty, was\r\nimproper and inconsistent with the friendship subsisting between the\r\nNabob of Bengal and the Company.\" And further on they say,--\"The Nabob\r\nhaving intimated that he had repeatedly stated the trouble and\r\nuneasiness which he had suffered from the naibship of the nizamut being\r\nvested in Mahomed Reza Khân, we observe one of the members of your board\r\ndesired the Nabob's repeated letters on the subject might be read, but\r\nthis reasonable request was overruled, on a plea of saving the board's\r\ntime, which we can by no means admit as a sufficient objection. The\r\nNabob's letters of the 25th and 30th August, of the 3d September and\r\n17th November, leave us no doubt of the true design of this\r\nextraordinary business being to bring forward Munny Begum, and again to\r\ninvest her with improper power and influence, notwithstanding our former\r\ndeclaration, that so great a part of the Nabob's allowance had been\r\nembezzled or misapplied under her superintendence.\"\r\n\r\nAt present I do not think it necessary, because it would be doing more\r\nthan enough, it would be slaying the slain, to show your Lordships what\r\nMr. Hastings's motives were in acting against the sense of the East\r\nIndia Company, appointed by an act of Parliament to control him,--that\r\nhe did it for a corrupt purpose, that all his pretences were false and\r\nfraudulent, and that he had his own corrupt views in the whole of the\r\nproceeding. But in the statement which I have given of this matter, I\r\nbeg your Lordships to observe the instruments with which Mr. Hastings\r\nacts. The great men of that country, and particularly the Subahdar\r\nhimself, the Nabob, are and is in so equivocal a situation, that it\r\nafforded him two bolting-holes, by which he is enabled to resist the\r\nauthority of the Company, and exercise an arbitrary authority of his\r\nown: for, though the Nabob has the titles of high sovereignty, he is the\r\nlowest of all dependants; he appears to be the master of the\r\ncountry,--he is a pensioner of the Company's government.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hastings wants him to obey and answer his corrupt purposes, he\r\nfinds him in the character of a pensioner: when he wants his authority\r\nto support him in opposition to the authority of the Company,\r\nimmediately he invests him with high sovereign powers, and he dare not\r\nexecute the orders of the Company for fear of doing some act that will\r\nmake him odious in the eyes of God and man. We see how he appointed all\r\nofficers for him, and forbade his interference in all affairs. When the\r\nCompany see the impropriety and the guilt of these acts, and order him\r\nto rescind them, and appoint again Mahomed Reza Khân, he declares he\r\nwill not, that he cannot do it in justice, but that he will consent to\r\nsend him the order of the Company, but without backing it with any order\r\nof the board: which, supposing even there had been no private\r\ncommunication, was, in other words, commanding him to disobey it. So\r\nthis poor man, who a short time before was at the feet of Mr. Hastings,\r\nwhom Mr. Hastings declared to be a pageant, and swore in a court of\r\njustice that he was but a pageant, and followed that affidavit with\r\nlong declarations in Council that he was a pageant in sovereignty, and\r\nought in policy ever to be held out as such,--this man he sets up in\r\nopposition to the Company, and refuses to appoint Mahomed Reza Khân to\r\nthe office which was guarantied to him by the express faith of the\r\nCompany, pledged to his support. Will any man tell me that this\r\nresistance, under such base, though plausible pretences, could spring\r\nfrom any other cause than a resolution of persisting systematically in\r\nhis course of corruption and bribery through Munny Begum?\r\n\r\nBut there is another circumstance that puts this in a stronger light. He\r\nopposes the Nabob's mock authority to the authority of the Company, and\r\nleaves Mahomed Reza Khân unemployed, because, as he says, he cannot in\r\njustice execute orders from the Company (though they are his undoubted\r\nmasters) contrary to the rights of the Nabob. You see what the rights of\r\nthe Nabob were: the rights of the Nabob were, to be governed by Munny\r\nBegum and her scandalous ministers. But, however, we now see him exalted\r\nto be an independent sovereign; he defies the Company at the head of\r\ntheir armies and their treasury; that name that makes all India shake\r\nwas defied by one of its pensioners. My Lords, human greatness is an\r\nunstable thing. This man, so suddenly exalted, was as soon depressed;\r\nand the manner of his depression is as curious as that of his exaltation\r\nby Mr. Hastings, and will tend to show you the man most clearly.\r\n\r\nMr. Francis, whose conduct all along was directed by no other principles\r\nthan those which were in conformity with the plan adopted by himself and\r\nhis virtuous colleagues, namely, an entire obedience to the laws of his\r\ncountry, and who constantly had opposed Mr. Hastings, upon principles of\r\nhonor, and principles of obedience to the authority of the Company under\r\nwhich he acted, had never contended for any one thing, in any way, or in\r\nany instance, but obedience to them, and had constantly asserted that\r\nMahomed Reza Khân ought to be put into employment. Mr. Hastings as\r\nconstantly opposed him; and the reason he gave for it was, that it was\r\nagainst the direct rights of the Nabob, and that they were rights so\r\nsacred that they could not be infringed even by the sovereign authority\r\nof the Company ordering him to do it. He had so great an aversion to the\r\nleast subtraction of the Nabob's right, that, though expressly commanded\r\nby the Court of Directors, he would not suffer Mahomed Reza Khân to be\r\ninvested with his office under the Company's authority. The Nabob was\r\ntoo sovereign, too supreme, for him to do it. But such is the fate of\r\nhuman grandeur, that a whimsical event reduced the Nabob to his state of\r\npageant again, and made him the mere subject of--you will see whom. Mr.\r\nHastings found he was so embarrassed by his disobedience to the spirit\r\nof the orders of the Company, and by the various wild projects he had\r\nformed, as to make it necessary for him, even though he had a majority\r\nin the Council, to gain over at any price Mr. Francis. Mr. Francis,\r\nfrightened by the same miserable situation of affairs, (for this\r\nhappened at a most dangerous period,--the height of the Mahratta war,)\r\nwas willing likewise to give up his opposition to Mr. Hastings, to\r\nsuspend the execution of many rightful things, and to concede them to\r\nthe public necessity. Accordingly he agreed to terms with Mr. Hastings.\r\nBut what was the price of that concession? Any base purpose, any\r\ndesertion of public duty? No: all that he desired of Mr. Hastings was,\r\nthat he should obey the orders of the Company; and among other acts of\r\nthe obedience required was this, that Mahomed Reza Khân should be put\r\ninto his office.\r\n\r\nYou have heard how Mr. Hastings opposed the order of the Company, and on\r\nwhat account he opposed it. On the 1st of September he sent an order to\r\nthe Nabob, now become his subject, to give up this office to Mahomed\r\nReza Khân: an act which he had before represented as a dethroning of the\r\nNabob. The order went on the 1st of September, and on the 3d this great\r\nand mighty prince, whom all earth could not move from the assertion of\r\nhis rights, gives them all up, and Mahomed Reza Khân is invested with\r\nthem. So there all his pretences were gone. It is plain that what had\r\nbeen done before was for Munny Begum, and that what he now gave up was\r\nfrom necessity: and it shows that the Nabob was the meanest of his\r\nservants; for in truth he ate his daily bread out of the hands of Mr.\r\nHastings, through Munny Begum.\r\n\r\nMahomed Reza Khân was now invested again with his office; but such was\r\nthe treachery of Mr. Hastings, that, though he wrote to the Nabob that\r\nthis was done in consequence of the orders of the Company, he did\r\nclandestinely, according to his usual mode, assure the Nabob that\r\nMahomed Reza Khân should not hold the place longer than till he heard\r\nfrom England. He then wrote him another letter, that he should hold it\r\nno longer than while he submitted to his present necessity, (thus giving\r\nup to his colleague what he refused to the Company,) and engaged,\r\nprivately, that he would dismiss Mahomed Reza Khân again. And\r\naccordingly, the moment he thought Mr. Francis was not in a condition to\r\ngive him trouble any longer, that moment he again turned out Mahomed\r\nReza Khân from that general superintendence of affairs which the Company\r\ngave him, and deposed him as a minister, leaving him only a very\r\nconfined authority as a magistrate.\r\n\r\nAll these changes, no less than four great revolutions, if I may so call\r\nthem, were made by Mr. Hastings for his own corrupt purposes. This is\r\nthe manner in which Mr. Hastings has played with the most sacred objects\r\nthat man ever had a dealing with: with the government, with the justice,\r\nwith the order, with the dignity, with the nobility of a great country:\r\nhe played with them to satisfy his own wicked and corrupt purposes\r\nthrough the basest instrument.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, I have done with these presumptions of corruption with\r\nMunny Begum, and have shown that it is not a slight crime, but that it\r\nis attended with a breach of public faith, with a breach of his orders,\r\nwith a breach of the whole English government, and the destruction of\r\nthe native government, of the police, the order, the safety, the\r\nsecurity, and the justice of the country,--and that all these are much\r\nconcerned in this cause. Therefore the Commons stand before the face of\r\nthe world, and say, We have brought a cause, a great cause, a cause\r\nworthy the Commons of England to prosecute, and worthy the Lords to\r\njudge and determine upon.\r\n\r\nI have now nothing further to state than what the consequences are of\r\nMr. Hastings taking bribes,--that Mr. Hastings's taking of bribes is not\r\nonly his own corruption, but the incurable corruption of the whole\r\nservice. I will show, first, that he was named in 1773 to put an end to\r\nthat corruption. I will show that he did not,--that he knowingly and\r\nwillingly connived at it,--and that that connivance was the principal\r\ncause of all the disorders that have hitherto prevailed in that country.\r\nI will show you that he positively refused to obey the Company's order\r\nto inquire into and to correct the corruptions that prevailed in that\r\ncountry; next, that he established an avowed system of connivance, in\r\norder to gain over everything that was corrupt in the country; and that,\r\nlastly, to secure it, he gave up all the prosecutions, and enervated and\r\ntook away the sole arm left to the Company for the assertion of\r\nauthority and the preservation of good morals and purity in their\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here is a letter, in the year 1773, in which the Court of\r\nDirectors had, upon his own representation, approved some part of his\r\nconduct. He is charmed with their approbation; he promises the greatest\r\nthings; but I believe your Lordships will see, from the manner in which\r\nhe proceeds at that very instant, that a more deliberate system, for not\r\nonly being corrupt himself, but supporting corruption in others, never\r\nwas exhibited in any public paper.\r\n\r\n\"While I indulge the pleasure which I receive from the past successes of\r\nmy endeavors, I own I cannot refrain from looking back with a mixture of\r\nanxiety on the omissions by which I am sensible I may since have\r\nhazarded the diminution of your esteem. All my letters addressed to your\r\nHonorable Court, and to the Secret Committee, repeat the strongest\r\npromises of prosecuting the inquiries into the conduct of your servants\r\nwhich you had been pleased to commit particularly to my charge. You will\r\nreadily perceive that I must have been sincere in those declarations;\r\nsince it would have argued great indiscretion to have made them, had I\r\nforeseen my inability to perform them. I find myself now under the\r\ndisagreeable necessity of avowing that inability; at the same time I\r\nwill boldly take upon me to affirm, that, on whomsoever you might have\r\ndelegated that charge, and by whatever powers it might have been\r\naccompanied, it would have been sufficient to occupy the entire\r\nattention of those who were intrusted with it, and, even with all the\r\naids of leisure and authority, would have proved ineffectual. I dare\r\nappeal to the public records, to the testimony of those who have\r\nopportunities of knowing me, and even to the detail which the public\r\nvoice can report of the past acts of this government, that my time has\r\nbeen neither idly nor uselessly employed: yet such are the cares and\r\nembarrassments of this various state, that, although much may be done,\r\nmuch more, even in matters of moment, must necessarily remain neglected.\r\nTo select from the miscellaneous heap which each day's exigencies\r\npresent to our choice those points on which the general welfare of your\r\naffairs most essentially depends, to provide expedients for future\r\nadvantages and guard against probable evils, are all that your\r\nadministration can faithfully promise to perform for your service with\r\ntheir united labors most diligently exerted. They cannot look back\r\nwithout sacrificing the objects of their immediate duty, which are those\r\nof your interests, to endless researches, which can produce no real\r\ngood, and may expose your affairs to all the ruinous consequences of\r\npersonal malevolence, both here and at home.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, this is the first man, I believe, that ever took credit for\r\nhis sincerity from his breach of his promises. \"I could not,\" he says,\r\n\"have made these promises, if I had not thought that I could perform\r\nthem. Now I find I cannot perform them, and you have in that\r\nnon-performance and in that profession a security for my sincerity when\r\nI promised them.\" Upon this principle, any man who makes a promise has\r\nnothing to do afterwards, but to say that he finds himself (without\r\nassigning any particular cause for it) unable to perform it,--not only\r\nto justify himself for his non-performance, but to justify himself and\r\nclaim credit for sincerity in his original profession. The charge was\r\ngiven him specially, and he promised obedience, over and over, upon the\r\nspot, and in the country, in which he was no novice, for he had been\r\nbred in it: it was his native country in one sense, it was the place of\r\nhis renewed nativity and regeneration. Yet this very man, as if he was a\r\nnovice in it, now says, \"I promised you what I now find I cannot\r\nperform.\" Nay, what is worse, he declares no man could perform it, if he\r\ngave up his whole time to it. And lastly, he says, that the inquiry into\r\nthese corruptions, even if you succeeded in it, would do more harm than\r\ngood. Now was there ever an instance of a man so basely deserting a\r\nduty, and giving so base a reason for it? His duty was to put an end to\r\ncorruption in every channel of government. It cannot be done. Why?\r\nBecause it would expose our affairs to malignity and enmity, and end,\r\nperhaps, to our disadvantage. Not only will he connive himself, but he\r\nadvises the Company to do it. For fear of what? For fear that their\r\nservice was so abandoned and corrupt, that the display of the evil would\r\ntend more to their disreputation than all their attempts to reform it\r\nwould tend to their service.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings should naturally have imagined that the law was a resource\r\nin this desperate case of bribery. He tells you, that in \"that charge of\r\noppression, though they were supported by the cries of the people and\r\nthe most authentic representations, it is yet impossible in most cases\r\nto obtain legal proofs.\" Here is a system of total despair upon the\r\nbusiness, which I hope and believe is not a desperate one, and has not\r\nproved a desperate one, whenever a rational attempt has been made to\r\npursue it. Here you find him corrupt, and you find, in consequence of\r\nthat corruption, that he screens the whole body of corruption in India,\r\nand states an absolute despair of any possibility, by any art or\r\naddress, of putting an end to it. Nay, he tells you, that, if corruption\r\ndid not exist, if it was not connived at, that the India Company could\r\nnot exist. Whether that be a truth or not I cannot tell; but this I\r\nknow, that it is the most horrible picture that ever was made of any\r\ncountry. It might be said that these were excuses for omissions,--sins\r\nof omission he calls them. I will show that they were systematic, that\r\nMr. Hastings did uniformly profess that he would connive at abuses, and\r\ncontend that abuses ought to be connived at. When the whole mystery of\r\nthe iniquity, in which he himself was deeply concerned, came to\r\nlight,--when it appeared that all the Company's orders were\r\ncontravened,--that contracts were given directly contrary to their\r\norders, and upon principles subversive of their government, leading to\r\nall manner of oppression and ruin to the country,--what was Mr.\r\nHastings's answer? \"I must here remark, that the majority ... I had not\r\nthe power of establishing it.\"[5] Then he goes on and states other cases\r\nof corruption, at every one of which he winks. Here he states another\r\nreason for his connivance. \"Suppose again,\" (for he puts another\r\nsupposition, and these suppositions are not hypotheses laid down for\r\nargument, but real facts then existing before the Council examining into\r\ngrievances,)--\"suppose again, that any person had benefited himself ...\r\nunprofitable discussion.\"[6]\r\n\r\nHere is a direct avowal of his refusing to examine into the conduct of\r\npersons in the Council, even in the highest departments of government,\r\nand the best paid, for fear he should dissatisfy them, and should lose\r\ntheir votes, by discovering those peculations and corruptions, though he\r\nperfectly knew them. Was there ever, since the world began, any man who\r\nwould dare to avow such sentiments, until driven to the wall? If he\r\ncould show that he himself abhorred bribes, and kept at a distance from\r\nthem, then he might say, \"I connive at the bribes of others\"; but when\r\nhe acknowledges that he takes bribes, how can you doubt that he buys a\r\ncorrupt confederacy, and puts an end to any hope through him of\r\nreformation of the abuses at Bengal? But your Lordships will see that he\r\nnot only connived at abuse, but patronized it and supported it for his\r\nown political purposes; since he here confesses, that, if inquiry into\r\nit created him ill-humor, and produced him an opposition in Council, he\r\nsacrificed it to the power of the Company, and the constitution of their\r\ngovernment. Did he so? The Company ordered him to prosecute those\r\npeople, and their constitution required that they should be prosecuted.\r\n\"No,\" says Mr. Hastings, \"the conniving at it procures a majority of\r\nvotes.\" The very thing that he bought was not worth half the price he\r\npaid for it. He was sent to reform corruptions, and, in order that he\r\nmight reform corruptions, he winked at, countenanced, and patronized\r\nthem, to get a majority of votes; and what was, in fact, a sacrifice to\r\nhis own interest, ambition, and corruption, he calls a sacrifice to the\r\nCompany. He puts, then, this alternative: \"Either give everything into\r\nmy hand, suffer me to go on, and have no control, or else I wink at\r\nevery species of corruption.\" It is a remarkable and stupendous thing,\r\nthat, when all the world was alarmed at the disorders of the Company,\r\nwhen that alarm occasioned his being sent out, and when, in consequence\r\nof that alarm, Parliament suspended the constitution of the Company, and\r\nappointed another government, Mr. Hastings should tell that Company that\r\nParliament had done wrong, and that the person put at the head of that\r\ngovernment was to wink at those abuses. Nay, what is more, not only does\r\nMr. Hastings declare, upon general principles, that it was impossible to\r\npursue all the delinquencies of India, and that, if possible to pursue\r\nthem, mischief would happen from it, but your Lordships will observe\r\nthat Mr. Hastings, in this business, during the whole period of the\r\nadministration of that body which was sent out to inquire into and\r\nreform the corruptions of India, did not call one person to an account;\r\nnor, except Mr. Hastings, this day, has any one been called to an\r\naccount, or punished for delinquency. Whether he will be punished or no,\r\ntime will show. I have no doubt of your Lordships' justice, and of the\r\ngoodness of our cause.\r\n\r\nThe table of the House of Commons groaned under complaints of the evils\r\ngrowing in India under this systematic connivance of Mr. Hastings. The\r\nDirectors had set on foot prosecutions, to be conducted God knows how;\r\nbut, such as they were, they were their only remedy; and they began to\r\nconsider at last that these prosecutions had taken a long oblivious nap\r\nof many years; and at last, knowing that they were likely, in the year\r\n1782, to be called to a strict account about their own conduct, the\r\nCourt of Directors began to rouse themselves, and they write thus:\r\n\"Having in several of our letters to you very attentively perused all\r\nthe proceedings referred to in these paragraphs, relative to the various\r\nforgeries on the Company's treasuries, we lament exceedingly that the\r\nparties should have been so long in confinement without being brought to\r\ntrial.\"\r\n\r\nHere, my Lords, after justice had been asleep awhile, it revived. They\r\ndirected two things: first, that those suits should be pursued; but\r\nwhether pursued or not, that an account of the state of them should be\r\ngiven, that they might give orders concerning them.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see the orders of the Company. Did they not want to\r\npursue and to revive those dormant prosecutions? They want to have a\r\nstate of them, that they may know how to direct the future conduct of\r\nthem with more effect and vigor than they had yet been pursued with. You\r\nwill naturally imagine that Mr. Hastings did not obey their orders, or\r\nobeyed them languidly. No, he took another part. He says, \"Having\r\nattentively read and weighed the arguments ... for withdrawing them.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThus he begins with the general principle of connivance; he directly\r\navows he does it for a political purpose; and when the Company directs\r\nhe shall proceed in the suits, instead of deferring to their judgment,\r\nhe takes the judgment on himself, and says theirs is untenable; he\r\ndirectly discharges the prosecutions of the Company, supersedes the\r\nauthority of his masters, and gives a general release to all the persons\r\nwho were still suffering by the feeble footsteps of justice in that\r\ncountry. He gave them an act of indemnity, and that was the last of his\r\nacts.\r\n\r\nNow, when I show the consequence of his bribery, the presumptions that\r\narise from his own bribes, his attention to secure others from the\r\npunishment of theirs, and, when ordered to carry on a suit, his\r\ndischarging it,--when we see all this, can we avoid judging and forming\r\nour opinions upon two grand points: first, that no man would proceed in\r\nthat universal patronage of guilt, unless he was guilty himself; next,\r\nthat, by a universal connivance for fourteen years, he is himself the\r\ncause and mainspring of all the evils, calamities, extortion, and\r\nbribery, that have prevailed and ravaged that country for so long a\r\ntime? There is, indeed, no doubt either of his guilt, or of the\r\nconsequences of it, by which he has extinguished the last expiring hope\r\nand glimpse that remained of procuring a remedy for India of the evils\r\nthat exist in it.\r\n\r\nI would mention, that, as a sort of postscript, when he could no longer\r\nput the government into the hands of that infamous woman, Munny Begum,\r\nhe sent an amorous, sentimental letter to the Company, describing her\r\nmiserable situation, and advising the Company to give her a pension of\r\nseventy-two thousand rupees a year, to maintain her. He describes her\r\nsituation in such a moving way as must melt every heart. He supposes her\r\nto be reduced to want by the cruel orders of the Company, who retain\r\nfrom her money which they were never obliged to give her. This\r\nrepresentation, which he makes with as much fairness as he represents\r\nhimself to be in a state of the most miserable poverty and distress, he\r\nalone made to the Company, because his colleagues would not countenance\r\nhim in it; and we find, upon looking over Lord Cornwallis's last\r\nexamination into the whole state of this unhappy family, that this woman\r\nwas able to lend to Mobarek ul Dowlah twenty thousand pounds. Mr.\r\nHastings, however, could not avoid making this representation; because\r\nhe knew, that, if he quitted the country without securing that woman, by\r\ngiving her a hope that she could procure by his credit here that money\r\nwhich by his authority he had before procured for her, she might then\r\nmake a discovery of all the corruption that had been carried on between\r\nthem; and therefore he squanders away the treasures of the Company, in\r\norder to secure himself from any such detection, and to procure for\r\nhimself _razinamas_ and all those fine things. He knew that Munny Begum,\r\nthat the whole seraglio, that all the country, whom he had put under the\r\ndominion of Sir John D'Oyly, that all those people might have made a\r\ndiscovery of all his corrupt proceedings; he therefore gets the Nabob to\r\nappoint Sir John D'Oyly his agent here, with a view of stopping his\r\nmouth, and by the hope of another 160,000_l._ a year to prevent his\r\ngiving an account of the dilapidation and robbery that was made of the\r\n160,000_l._ which had been left him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now finished what I proposed to say relative to his great fund of\r\nbribery, in the first instance of it,--namely, the administration of\r\njustice in the country. There is another system of bribery which I shall\r\nstate before my friends produce the evidence. He put up all the great\r\noffices of the country to sale; he makes use of the trust he had of the\r\nrevenues in order to destroy the whole system of those revenues, and to\r\nbind them and make them subservient to his system of bribery: and this\r\nwill make it necessary for your Lordships to couple the consideration of\r\nthe charge of the revenues, in some instances, with that of bribery.\r\n\r\nThe next day your Lordships meet (when I hope I shall not detain you so\r\nlong) I mean to open the second stage of his bribery, the period of\r\ndiscovery: for the first stage was the period of concealment. When he\r\nfound his bribes could no longer be concealed, he next took upon him to\r\ndiscover them himself, and to take merit from them.\r\n\r\nWhen I shall have opened the second scene of his peculation, and his new\r\nprinciples of it, when you see him either treading in old corruptions,\r\nand excelling the examples he imitated, or exhibiting new ones of his\r\nown, in which of the two his conduct is the most iniquitous, and\r\nattended with most evil to the Company, I must leave your Lordships to\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Document wanting.\r\n\r\n[3] Document wanting.\r\n\r\n[4] Document wanting.\r\n\r\n[5] Document wanting.\r\n\r\n[6] Document wanting.\r\n\r\n[7] Document wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nON\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH ARTICLE OF CHARGE.\r\n\r\nTHIRD DAY: TUESDAY, MAY 5, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--Agreeably to your Lordships' proclamation, which I have just\r\nheard, and the duty enjoined me by the House of Commons, I come forward\r\nto make good their charge of high crimes and misdemeanors against Warren\r\nHastings, Esquire, late Governor-General of Bengal, and now a prisoner\r\nat your bar.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, since I had last the honor of standing in this place before\r\nyour Lordships, an event has happened upon which it is difficult to\r\nspeak and impossible to be silent. My Lords, I have been disavowed by\r\nthose who sent me here to represent them. My Lords, I have been\r\ndisavowed in a material part of that engagement which I had pledged\r\nmyself to this House to perform. My Lords, that disavowal has been\r\nfollowed by a censure. And yet, my Lords, so censured and so disavowed,\r\nand by such an authority, I am sent here again, to this the place of my\r\noffence, under the same commission, by the same authority, to make good\r\nthe same charge, against the same delinquent.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the situation is new and awful: the situation is such as, I\r\nbelieve, and I am sure, has nothing like it on the records of\r\nParliament, nor, probably, in the history of mankind. My Lords, it is\r\nnot only new and singular, but, I believe, to many persons, who do not\r\nlook into the true interior nature of affairs, it may appear that it\r\nwould be to me as mortifying as it is unprecedented. But, my Lords, I\r\nhave in this situation, and upon the consideration of all the\r\ncircumstances, something more to feed my mind with than mere\r\nconsolation; because, my Lords, I look upon the whole of these\r\ncircumstances, considered together, as the strongest, the most decisive,\r\nand the least equivocal proof which the Commons of Great Britain can\r\ngive of their sincerity and their zeal in this prosecution. My Lords, is\r\nit from a mistaken tenderness or a blind partiality to me, that, thus\r\ncensured, they have sent me to this place? No, my Lords, it is because\r\nthey feel, and recognize in their own breasts, that active principle of\r\njustice, that zeal for the relief of the people of India, that zeal for\r\nthe honor of Great Britain, which characterizes me and my excellent\r\nassociates, that, in spite of any defects, in consequence of that zeal\r\nwhich they applaud, and while they censure its mistakes, and, because\r\nthey censure its mistakes, do but more applaud, they have sent me to\r\nthis place, instructed, but not dismayed, to pursue this prosecution\r\nagainst Warren Hastings, Esquire. Your Lordships will therefore be\r\npleased to consider this, as I consider it, not as a thing honorable to\r\nme, in the first place, but as honorable to the Commons of Great\r\nBritain, in whose honor the national glory is deeply concerned; and I\r\nshall suffer myself with pleasure to be sacrificed, perhaps, in what is\r\ndearer to me than my life, my reputation, rather than let it be supposed\r\nthat the Commons should for one moment have faltered in their duty. I,\r\nmy Lords, on the one hand, feeling myself supported and encouraged,\r\nfeeling protection and countenance from this admonition and warning\r\nwhich has been given to me, will show myself, on the other hand, not\r\nunworthy so great and distinguished a mark of the favor of the\r\nCommons,--a mark of favor not the consequence of flattery, but of\r\nopinion. I shall feel animated and encouraged by so noble a reward as I\r\nshall always consider the confidence of the Commons to be: the only\r\nreward, but a rich reward, which I have received for the toils and\r\nlabors of a long life.\r\n\r\nThe Commons, then, thus vindicated, and myself thus encouraged, I shall\r\nproceed to make good the charge in which the honor of the Commons, that\r\nis, the national honor, is so deeply concerned. For, my Lords, if any\r\ncircumstance of weakness, if any feebleness of nerve, if any yielding to\r\nweak and popular opinions and delusions were to shake us, consider what\r\nthe situation of this country would be. This prosecution, if weakly\r\nconceived, ill digested, or intemperately pursued, ought never to have\r\nbeen brought to your Lordships' bar: but being brought to your\r\nLordships' bar, the nation is committed to it, and the least appearance\r\nof uncertainty in our minds would disgrace us forever. _Esto perpetua_,\r\nhas been said. To the glory of this nation, much more be it said, _Esto\r\nperpetua_; and I will say, that, as we have raised and exhibited a\r\ntheatre of justice which has excited the admiration of all Europe, there\r\nwould be a sort of lustre in our infamy, and a splendor in the disgrace\r\nthat we should bring upon ourselves, if we should, just at that moment,\r\nturn that theatre of our glory into a spectacle of dishonor beyond what\r\nhas ever happened to any country of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Commons of Great Britain, whilst willing to keep a strong and firm\r\nhand over all those who represent them in any business, do at the same\r\ntime encourage them in the prosecution of it, by allowing them a just\r\ndiscretion and latitude wherever their own orders have not marked a\r\ndistinction. I shall therefore go on with the more cheerful confidence,\r\nnot only for the reasons that I have stated, but for another and\r\nmaterial reason. I know and am satisfied, that, in the nobleness of your\r\njudgment, you will always make a distinction between the person that\r\ngives the order and the organ that is to execute it. The House of\r\nCommons know no such thing as indiscretion, imprudence, or impropriety:\r\nit is otherwise with their instruments. Your Lordships very well know,\r\nthat, if you hear anything that shall appear to you to be regular, apt\r\nto bring forward the charge, just, prudent, cogent, you are to give it\r\nto the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament assembled; if you should\r\nhear from me (and it must be from me alone, and not from any other\r\nmember of the Committee) anything that is unworthy of that situation,\r\nthat comes feeble, weak, indigested, or ill-prepared, you are to\r\nattribute that to the instrument. Your Lordships' judgment would do this\r\nwithout my saying it. But whilst I claim it on the part of the Commons\r\nfor their dignity, I claim for myself the necessary indulgence that must\r\nbe given to all weakness. Your Lordships, then, will impute it where you\r\nwould have imputed it without my desire. It is a distinction you would\r\nnaturally have made, and the rather because what is alleged by us at the\r\nbar is not the ground upon which you are to give judgment. If not only\r\nI, but the whole body of managers, had made use of any such expressions\r\nas I made use of,--even if the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament\r\nassembled, if the collective body of Parliament, if the voice of Europe,\r\nhad used them,--if we had spoken with the tongues of men and angels,\r\nyou, in the seat of judicature, are not to regard what we say, but what\r\nwe prove; you are to consider whether the charge is well substantiated,\r\nand proof brought out by legal inference and argument. You know, and I\r\nam sure the habits of judging which your Lordships have acquired by\r\nsitting in judgment must better inform you than any other men, that the\r\nduties of life, in order to be well performed, must be methodized,\r\nseparated, arranged, and harmonized in such a manner that they shall not\r\nclash with one another, but each have a department assigned and\r\nseparated to itself. My Lords, in that manner it is that we, the\r\nprosecutors, have nothing to do with the principles which are to guide\r\nthe judgment, that we have nothing to do with the defence of the\r\nprisoner. Your Lordships well know, that, when we come before you, you\r\nhear a party; that, when the accused come before you, you hear a party:\r\nthat it is for you to doubt, and wait till you come to the close, before\r\nyou decide; that it is for us, the prosecutors, to have decided before\r\nwe came here. To act as prosecutors, we ought to have no doubt or\r\nhesitation, nothing trembling or quivering in our minds upon the\r\noccasion. We ought to be fully convinced of guilt, before we come to\r\nyou. It is, then, our business to bring forward the proofs,--to enforce\r\nthem with all the clearness, illustration, example, that we can bring\r\nforward,--that we are to show the circumstances that can aggravate the\r\nguilt,--that we are to go further, show the mischievous consequences and\r\ntendency of those crimes to society,--and that we are, if able so to do,\r\nto arouse and awaken in the minds of all that hear us those generous and\r\nnoble sympathies which Providence has planted in the breasts of all men,\r\nto be the true guardians of the common rights of humanity. Your\r\nLordships know that this is the duty of the prosecutors, and that\r\ntherefore we are not to consider the defence of the party, which is\r\nwisely and properly left to himself; but we are to press the accusation\r\nwith all the energy of which it is capable, and to come with minds\r\nperfectly convinced before an august and awful tribunal which at once\r\ntries the accuser and the accused.\r\n\r\nHaving stated thus much with respect to the Commons, I am to read to\r\nyour Lordships the resolution which the Commons have come to upon this\r\ngreat occasion, and upon which I shall take the liberty to say a very\r\nfew words.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the Commons have resolved last night, and I did not see the\r\nresolution till this morning, \"that no direction or authority was given\r\nby this House to the committee appointed to manage the impeachment\r\nagainst Warren Hastings, Esquire, to make any charge or allegation\r\nagainst the said Warren Hastings respecting the condemnation or\r\nexecution of Nundcomar; and that the words spoken by the Right Honorable\r\nEdmund Burke, one of the said managers, _videlicet_, that he (meaning\r\nMr. Hastings) murdered that man (meaning Nundcomar) by the hands of Sir\r\nElijah Impey, ought not to have been spoken.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, this is the resolution of the House of Commons. Your\r\nLordships well know and remember my having used such or similar words,\r\nand the end and purpose for which I used them. I owe a few words of\r\nexplanation to the Commons of Great Britain, who attend in a committee\r\nof the whole House to be the observers and spectators of my conduct. I\r\nowe it to your Lordships, I owe it to this great auditory, I owe it to\r\nthe present times and to posterity, to make some apology for a\r\nproceeding which has drawn upon me the disavowal of the House which I\r\nrepresent. Your Lordships will remember that this charge which I have\r\nopened to your Lordships is primarily a charge founded upon the evidence\r\nof the Rajah Nundcomar; and consequently I thought myself obliged, I\r\nthought it a part of my duty, to support the credit of that person, who\r\nis the principal evidence to support the direct charge that is brought\r\nbefore your Lordships. I knew that Mr. Hastings, in his anticipated\r\ndefence before the House of Commons, had attempted to shake the credit\r\nof that witness. I therefore thought myself justified in informing your\r\nLordships, and in warning him, that, if he did attempt to shake the\r\ncredit of an important witness against him by an allegation of his\r\nhaving been condemned and executed for a forgery, I would endeavor to\r\nsupport his credit by attacking that very prosecution which brought on\r\nthat condemnation and that execution; and that I did consider it, and\r\nwould lay grounds before your Lordships to prove it, to be a murder\r\ncommitted, instead of a justification set up, or that ought to be set\r\nup.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, I am ordered by the Commons no longer to persist in that\r\ndeclaration; and I, who know nothing in this place, and ought to know\r\nnothing in this place, but obedience to the Commons, do mean, when Mr.\r\nHastings makes that objection (if he shall be advised to make it)\r\nagainst the credit of Rajah Nundcomar, not thus to support that credit;\r\nand therefore that objection to the credit of the witness must go\r\nunrefuted by me. My Lords, I must admit, perhaps against my private\r\njudgment, (but that is of no consideration for your Lordships, when\r\nopposed to the judgment of the House of Commons,) or, at least, not\r\ncontest, that a first minister of state, in a great kingdom, who had the\r\nbenefit of the administration, and of the entire and absolute command of\r\na revenue of fifteen hundred thousand pounds a year, had been guilty of\r\na paltry forgery in Calcutta; that this man, who had been guilty of this\r\npaltry forgery, had waited for his sentence and his punishment, till a\r\nbody of English judges, armed with an English statute, came to Calcutta;\r\nand that this happened at the very happy nick and moment when he was\r\naccusing Mr. Hastings of the bribery with which we now in the name of\r\nthe Commons charge him; that it was owing to an entirely fortuitous\r\nconcurrence of circumstances, in which Mr. Hastings had no share, or\r\nthat it was owing to something beyond this, something that is rather\r\npious than fortuitous, namely, that, as Mr. Hastings tells you himself,\r\n\"all persuasions of men were impressed with a superstitious belief that\r\na fortunate influence directed all my actions to their destined ends.\"\r\nI, not being at that time infected with the superstition, and\r\nconsidering what I thought Mr. Hastings's guilt to be, and what I must\r\nprove it to be as well as I can, did not believe that Providence did\r\nwatch over Mr. Hastings, so as in the nick of time, like a god in a\r\nmachine, to come down to save him in the moment of his imminent peril\r\nand distress: I did not think so, but I must not say so.\r\n\r\nBut now, to show that it was not weakly, loosely, or idly, that I took\r\nup this business, or that I anticipated a defence which it was not\r\nprobable for Mr. Hastings to make, (and I wish to speak to your\r\nLordships in the first instance, but to the Commons in the next,) I will\r\nread part of Mr. Hastings's defence before the House of Commons: it is\r\nin evidence before your Lordships. He says,--\"My accuser\" (meaning\r\nmyself, then acting as a private member of Parliament) \"charges me with\r\n'the receipt of large sums of money, corruptly taken before the\r\npromulgation of the Regulating Act of 1773, contrary to my covenants\r\nwith the Company, and with the receipt of very large sums taken since,\r\nin defiance of that law, and contrary to my declared sense of its\r\nprovisions.' And he ushers in this charge in the following pompous\r\ndiction: 'That in March, 1775, the late Rajah Nundcomar, a native Hindoo\r\nof the highest caste in his religion, and of the highest rank in\r\nsociety, by the offices which he had held under the country government,\r\ndid lay before the Council an account of various sums of money,' &c. It\r\nwould naturally strike every person ignorant of the character of\r\nNundcomar, that an accusation made by a person of the highest caste in\r\nhis religion and of the highest rank by his offices demanded particular\r\nnotice, and acquired a considerable degree of credit, from a prevalent\r\nassociation of ideas that a nice sense of honor is connected with an\r\nelevated rank of life: but when this honorable House is informed that my\r\naccuser knew (though he suppressed the facts) that this person, of high\r\nrank and high caste, had forfeited every pretension to honor, veracity,\r\nand credit,--that there are facts recorded on the very Proceedings which\r\nmy accuser partially quotes, proving this man to have been guilty of a\r\nmost flagrant forgery of letters from Munny Begum and the Nabob Yeteram\r\nul Dowlah, (independent of the forgery for which he suffered death,) of\r\nthe most deliberate treachery to the state, for which he was confined,\r\nby the orders of the Court of Directors, to the limits of the town of\r\nCalcutta, in order to prevent his dangerous intrigues, and of having\r\nviolated every principle of common honesty in private life,--I say, when\r\nthis honorable House is acquainted it is from mutilated and garbled\r\nassertions, founded on the testimony of such an evidence, without the\r\nwhole matter being fairly stated, I do hope and trust it will be\r\nsufficient for them to reject _now_ these vague and unsupported charges,\r\nin like manner as they were _before_ rejected by the Court of Directors\r\nand his Majesty's ministers, when they were first made by General\r\nClavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr. Francis.--I must here interrupt the\r\ncourse of my defence to explain on what grounds I employed or had any\r\nconnection with a man of so flagitious a character as Nundcomar.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I hope this was a good and reasonable ground for me to\r\nanticipate the defence which Mr. Hastings would make in this\r\nHouse,--namely, on the known, recognized, infamous character of\r\nNundcomar, with regard to certain proceedings there charged at large,\r\nwith regard to one forgery for which he suffered and two other forgeries\r\nwith which Mr. Hastings charged him. I, who found that the Commons of\r\nGreat Britain had received that very identical charge of Nundcomar, and\r\ngiven it to me in trust to make it good, did naturally, I hope\r\nexcusably, (for that is the only ground upon which I stand,) endeavor to\r\nsupport that credit upon which the House acted. I hope I did so; and I\r\nhope that the goodness of that intention may excuse me, if I went a\r\nlittle too far on that occasion. I would have endeavored to support that\r\ncredit, which it was much Mr. Hastings's interest to shake, and which he\r\nhad before attempted to shake.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will have the goodness to suppose me now making my\r\napology, and by no manner of means intending to persist either in this,\r\nor in anything which the House of Commons shall desire me not to declare\r\nin their name. But the House of Commons has not denied me the liberty to\r\nmake you this just apology: God forbid they should! for they would be\r\nguilty of great injustice, if they did. The House of Commons, whom I\r\nrepresent, will likewise excuse me, their representative, whilst I have\r\nbeen endeavoring to support their characters in the face of the world,\r\nand to make an apology, and only an humble apology, for my conduct, for\r\nhaving considered that act in the light that I represented it,--and\r\nwhich I did merely from my private opinion, without any formal\r\ninstruction from the House. For there is no doubt that the House is\r\nperfectly right, inasmuch as the House did neither formally instruct me\r\nnor at all forbid my making use of such an argument; and therefore I\r\nhave given your Lordships the reason why it was fit to make use of such\r\nargument,--if it was right to make use of it. I am in the memory of your\r\nLordships that I did conceive it to be relevant, and it was by the\r\npoverty of the language I was led to express my private feelings under\r\nthe name of a _murder_. For, if the language had furnished me, under the\r\nimpression of those feelings, with a word sufficient to convey the\r\ncomplicated atrocity of that act, as I felt it in my mind, I would not\r\nhave made use of the word _murder_. It was on account of the language\r\nfurnishing me with no other I was obliged to use that word. Your\r\nLordships do not imagine, I hope, that I used that word in any other\r\nthan a moral and popular sense, or that I used it in the legal and\r\ntechnical sense of the word _murder_. Your Lordships know that I could\r\nnot bring before this bar any commoner of Great Britain on a charge for\r\nmurder. I am not so ignorant of the laws and constitution of my country.\r\nI expressed an act which I conceived to be of an atrocious and evil\r\nnature, and partaking of some of the moral evil consequences of that\r\ncrime. What led me into that error? Nine years' meditation upon that\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the prisoner at the bar in the year 1780 sent a petition to\r\nthe House of Commons complaining of that very chief-justice, Sir Elijah\r\nImpey. The House of Commons, who then had some trust in me, as they have\r\nsome trust still, did order me, along with persons more wise and\r\njudicious than myself, several of whom stand near me, to make an inquiry\r\ninto the state of the justice of that country. The consequence of that\r\ninquiry was, that we began to conceive a very bad opinion both of the\r\ncomplainant and defendant in that business,--that we found the English\r\njustice to be, as we thought it, and reported it to the House, a\r\ngrievance, instead of a redress, to the people of India. I could bring\r\nbefore your Lordships, if I did not spare your patience, whole volumes\r\nof reports, whole bodies of evidence, which, in the progress we have\r\nmade in the course of eight or nine years, brought to my mind such a\r\nconviction as will never be torn from my heart but with my life; and I\r\nshould have no heart that was fit to lodge any honest sentiment, if I\r\ndeparted from my opinion upon that occasion. But when I declare my own\r\nfirm opinion upon it,--when I declare the reasons that led me to\r\nit,--when I mention the long meditation that preceded my founding a\r\njudgment upon it, the strict inquiry, the many hours and days spent in\r\nconsideration, collation, and comparison,--I trust that infirmity which\r\ncould be actuated by no malice to one party or the other may be excused;\r\nI trust that I shall meet with this indulgence, when your Lordships\r\nconsider, that, as far as you know me, as far as my public services for\r\nmany years account for me, I am a man of a slow, laborious, inquisitive\r\ntemper, that I do seldom leave a pursuit without leaving marks, perhaps\r\nof my weakness, but leaving marks of that labor, and that, in\r\nconsequence of that labor, I made that affirmation, and thought the\r\nnature of the cause obliged me to support and substantiate it. It is\r\ntrue that those who sent me here have sagacity to decide upon the\r\nsubject in a week; they can in one week discover the errors of my labors\r\nfor nine years.\r\n\r\nNow that I have made this apology to you, I assure you, you shall never\r\nhear me, either in my own name here, much less in the name of the\r\nCommons, urge one thing to you in support of the credit of Nundcomar\r\ngrounded upon that judgment, until the House shall instruct and order me\r\notherwise; because I know, that, when I can discover their sentiments,\r\nI ought to know nothing here but what is in strict and literal obedience\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, another thing might make me, perhaps, a little willing to be\r\nadmitted to the proof of what I advanced, and that is, the very answer\r\nof Mr. Hastings to this charge, which the House of Commons, however,\r\nhave adopted, and therefore in some degree purified. \"To the malicious\r\npart of this charge, which is the condemnation of Nundcomar for a\r\nforgery, I do declare, in the most solemn and unreserved manner, that I\r\nhad no concern, either directly or indirectly, in the apprehending,\r\nprosecuting, or executing of Nundcomar. He suffered for a crime of\r\nforgery which he had committed in a private trust that was delegated to\r\nhim, and for which he had been prosecuted in the dewanny courts of the\r\ncountry before the institution of the Supreme Court of Judicature. To\r\nadduce this circumstance, therefore, as a confirmation of what was\r\nbefore suspicious from his general depravity of character, is just as\r\nreasonable as to assert that the accusations of Empson and Dudley were\r\nconfirmed because they suffered death for their atrocious acts.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, this was Mr. Hastings's defence before the House of Commons,\r\nand it is now in evidence before your Lordships. In this defence, he\r\nsupposes the charge which was made originally before the Commons, and\r\nwhich the Commons voted, (though afterwards, for the convenience of\r\nshortening it, the affair was brought before your Lordships in the way\r\nin which it is,)--he supposes, I say, the whole to proceed from a\r\nmalicious intention; and I hope your Lordships will not think, and I\r\nhope the Commons, reconsidering this matter, will not think, that, when\r\nsuch an imputation of malice was made for the purpose of repelling this\r\ncorroborating argument which was used in the House of Commons to prove\r\nhis guilt, I was wrong in attempting to support the House of Commons\r\nagainst his imputation of malice.\r\n\r\nI must observe where I am limited and where I am not. I am limited,\r\nstrictly, fully, (and your Lordships and my country, who hear me, will\r\njudge how faithfully I shall adhere to that limitation,) not to support\r\nthe credit of Nundcomar by any allegation against Mr. Hastings\r\nrespecting his condemnation or execution; but I am not at all limited\r\nfrom endeavoring to support his credit against Mr. Hastings's charges of\r\nother forgeries, and from showing you, what I hope to show you clearly\r\nin a few words, that Nundcomar cannot be presumed guilty of forgery with\r\nmore probability than Mr. Hastings is guilty of bringing forward a light\r\nand dangerous (for I use no other words than a light and dangerous)\r\ncharge of forgery, when it serves his purpose. Mr. Hastings charges\r\nNundcomar with two other forgeries. \"These two forgeries,\" he says, \"are\r\nfacts recorded in the very Proceedings which my accuser partially\r\nquotes, proving this man to have been guilty of a most flagrant forgery\r\nof a letter from Munny Begum, and of a letter from the Nabob Yeteram ul\r\nDowlah\"; and therefore he infers malice in those who impute anything\r\nimproper to him, knowing that the proof stood so. Here he asserts that\r\nthere are records before the House of Commons, and on the Company's\r\nProceedings and Consultations, proving Nundcomar to have been guilty of\r\nthese two forgeries. Turn over the next page of his printed defence, and\r\nyou find a very extraordinary thing. You would have imagined that this\r\nforgery of a letter from Munny Begum, which, he says, is recognized and\r\nproved on the Journals, was a forgery charged by Munny Begum herself, or\r\nby somebody on her part, or some person concerned in this business.\r\nThere is no other charge of it whatever, but the charge of Warren\r\nHastings himself. He wants you to discredit a man for forgery upon no\r\nevidence under heaven but that of his own, who thinks proper, without\r\nany sort of authority, without any sort of reference, without any sort\r\nof collateral evidence, to charge a man with that very direct forgery.\r\n\"You are,\" he says, \"well informed of the reasons which first induced me\r\nto give any share of my confidence to Nundcomar, with whose character I\r\nwas acquainted by an experience of many years. The means which he\r\nhimself took to acquire it were peculiar to himself. He sent a messenger\r\nto me at Madras, on the first news of my appointment to this Presidency,\r\nwith pretended letters from Munny Begum and the Nabob Yeteram ul Dowlah,\r\nthe brother of the Nabob Jaffier Ali Khân, filled with bitter invectives\r\nagainst Mahomed Reza Khân, and of as warm recommendations, as I\r\nrecollect, of Nundcomar. I have been since informed by the Begum that\r\nthe letter which bore her seal was a complete forgery, and that she was\r\ntotally unacquainted with the use which had been made of her name till I\r\ninformed her of it. Juggut Chund, Nundcomar's son-in-law, was sent to\r\nher expressly to entreat her not to divulge it. Mr. Middleton, whom she\r\nconsulted on the occasion, can attest the truth of this story.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Middleton is dead, my Lords. This is not the Mr. Middleton whom your\r\nLordships have heard and know well in this House, but a brother of that\r\nMr. Middleton, who is since dead. Your Lordships find, when we refer to\r\nthe records of the Company for the proof of this forgery, that there is\r\nno other than the unsupported assertion of Mr. Hastings himself that he\r\nwas guilty of it. Now that was bad enough; but then hear the rest. Mr.\r\nHastings has charged this unhappy man, whom we must not defend, with\r\nanother forgery; he has charged him with a forgery of a letter from\r\nYeteram ul Dowlah to Mr. Hastings. Now you would imagine that he would\r\nhave given his own authority at least for that assertion, which he says\r\nwas proved. He goes on and says, \"I have not yet had the curiosity to\r\ninquire of the Nabob Yeteram ul Dowlah whether his letter was of the\r\nsame stamp; but I cannot doubt it.\"\r\n\r\nNow here he begins, in this very defence which is before your Lordships,\r\nto charge a forgery upon the credit of Munny Begum, without supporting\r\nit even by his own testimony,--and another forgery in the name of\r\nYeteram ul Dowlah, which he said he had not even the curiosity to\r\ninquire into, and yet desires you, at the same time, to believe it to be\r\nproved. Good God! in what condition do men of the first character and\r\nsituation in that country stand, when we have here delivered to us, as a\r\nrecord of the Company, Mr. Hastings's own assertions, saying that these\r\nforgeries were proved, though you have for the first nothing but his own\r\nunsupported assertion, and for the second his declaration only that he\r\nhad not the curiosity to inquire into it! I am not forbidden by the\r\nCommons to state how and on what slight grounds Warren Hastings charges\r\nthe natives of the country with forgery; neither am I forbidden to bring\r\nforward the accusation which Mr. Hastings made against Nundcomar for a\r\nconspiracy, nor the event of it, nor any circumstance relative to it. I\r\nshall therefore proceed in the best manner I can. There was a period,\r\namong the revolutions of philosophy, when there was an opinion, that, if\r\na man lost one limb or organ, the strength of that which was lost\r\nretired into what was left. My Lords, if we are straitened in this, then\r\nour vigor will be redoubled in the rest, and we shall use it with double\r\nforce. If the top and point of the sword is broken off, we shall take\r\nthe hilt in our hand, and fight with whatever remains of the weapon\r\nagainst bribery, corruption, and peculation; and we shall use double\r\ndiligence under any restraint which the wisdom of the Commons may lay\r\nupon us, or your Lordships' wisdom may oblige us to submit to.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through this business, and shown in what manner I am\r\nrestrained, where I am not to repel Mr. Hastings's defence, and where I\r\nam left at large to do it, I shall submit to the strict injunction with\r\nthe utmost possible humility, and enjoy the liberty which is left to me\r\nwith vigor, with propriety, and with discretion, I trust.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, when the circumstance happened which has given occasion to the\r\nlong parenthesis by which my discourse has been interrupted, I remember\r\nI was beginning to open to your Lordships the second period of Mr.\r\nHastings's scheme and system of bribery. My Lords, his bribery is so\r\nextensive, and has had such a variety in it, that it must be\r\ndistinguished not only with regard to its kind, but must be likewise\r\ndistinguished according to the periods of bribery and the epochas of\r\npeculation committed by him. In the first of those periods we shall\r\nprove to your Lordships, I believe, without the aids that we hoped for,\r\n(your Lordships allowing, as I trust you will do, a good deal for our\r\nsituation,)--we shall be able, I say, to prove that Mr. Hastings took,\r\nas a bribe for appointing Munny Begum, three lac and an half of rupees;\r\nwe shall prove the taking at the same time the Rajeshaye bribes. Mr.\r\nHastings at that time followed bribery in a natural manner: he took a\r\nbribe; he took it as large as he could; he concealed it as well as he\r\ncould; and he got out of it by artifice or boldness, by use of trick or\r\nuse of power, just as he was enabled: he acted like a wild, natural man,\r\nvoid of instruction, discipline, and art.\r\n\r\nThe second period opened another system of bribery. About this time he\r\nbegan to think (from what communication your Lordships may guess) of\r\nother means by which, when he could no longer conceal any bribe that he\r\nhad received, he not only might exempt himself from the charge and the\r\npunishment of guilt, but might convert it into a kind of merit, and,\r\ninstead of a breaker of laws, a violator of his trust, a receiver of\r\nscandalous bribes, a peculator of the first magnitude, might make\r\nhimself to be considered as a great, distinguishing, eminent financier,\r\na collector of revenue in new and extraordinary ways, and that we should\r\nthus at once praise his diligence, industry, and ingenuity. The scheme\r\nhe set on foot was this: he pretended that the Company could not exist\r\nupon principles of strict justice, (for so he expresses it,) and that\r\ntheir affairs, in many cases, could not be so well accommodated by a\r\nregular revenue as by privately taking money, which was to be applied to\r\ntheir service by the person who took it, at his discretion. This was the\r\nprinciple he laid down. It would hardly be believed, I imagine, unless\r\nstrong proof appeared, that any man could be so daring as to hold up\r\nsuch a resource to a regular government, which had three million of\r\nknown, avowed, a great part of it territorial, revenue. But it is\r\nnecessary, it seems, to piece out the lion's skin with a fox's tail,--to\r\ntack on a little piece of bribery and a little piece of peculation, in\r\norder to help out the resources of a great and flourishing state; that\r\nthey should have in the knavery of their servants, in the breach of\r\ntheir laws, and in the entire defiance of their covenants, a real\r\nresource applicable to their necessities, of which they were not to\r\njudge, but the persons who were to take the bribes; and that the bribes\r\nthus taken were, by a mental reservation, a private intention in the\r\nmind of the taker, unknown to the giver, to be some time or other, in\r\nsome way or other, applied to the public service. The taking such bribes\r\nwas to become a justifiable act, in consequence of that reservation in\r\nthe mind of the person who took them; and he was not to be called to\r\naccount for them in any other way than as he thought fit.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, an act of Parliament passed in the year 1773, the whole drift\r\nof which, I may say, was to prevent bribery, peculation, and extortion\r\nin the Company's servants; and the act was penned, I think, with as much\r\nstrictness and rigor as ever act was penned. The 24th clause of Chap.\r\n63, 13 Geo. III., has the following enactment: \"And be it further\r\nenacted by the authority aforesaid, that, from and after the first day\r\nof August, 1774, no person holding or exercising any civil or military\r\noffice under the crown, or the said United Company, in the East Indies,\r\nshall accept, receive, or take, directly or indirectly, by himself, or\r\nany other person or persons on his behalf, or for his use or benefit,\r\nof and from any of the Indian princes or powers, or their ministers or\r\nagents, or any of the natives of Asia, any present, gift, donation,\r\ngratuity, or reward, pecuniary or otherwise, upon any account, or on any\r\npretence whatsoever, or any promise or engagement for any present, gift,\r\ndonation, gratuity, or reward: and if any person, holding or exercising\r\nany such civil or military office, shall be guilty of any such offence,\r\nand shall be thereof legally convicted,\" &c., &c. It then imposes the\r\npenalties: and your Lordships see that human wisdom cannot pen an act\r\nmore strongly directed against taking bribes upon any pretence whatever.\r\n\r\nThis act of Parliament was in affirmance of the covenant entered into by\r\nthe servants of the Company, and of the explicit orders of the Company,\r\nwhich forbid any person whatever in trust, \"directly or indirectly, to\r\naccept, take, or receive, or agree to accept, take, or receive, any\r\ngift, reward, gratuity, allowance, donation, or compensation, in money,\r\neffects, jewels, _or otherwise howsoever_, from any of the Indian\r\nprinces, sovereigns, subahs, or nabobs, or any of their ministers,\r\nservants, or agents, exceeding the value of four thousand rupees, &c.,\r\n&c. And that he, the said Warren Hastings, shall and will convey,\r\nassign, and make over to the said United Company, for their sole and\r\nproper use and benefit, all and every such gifts, rewards, gratuities,\r\nallowances, donations, or compensations whatsoever, which, contrary to\r\nthe true intent and meaning of these presents, shall come into the\r\nhands, possession, or power of the said Warren Hastings, or any other\r\nperson or persons in trust for him or for his use.\"\r\n\r\nThe nature of the covenant, the act of Parliament, and the Company's\r\norders are clear. First, they have not forbidden their\r\nGovernor-General, nor any of their Governors, to take and accept from\r\nthe princes of the country, openly and publicly, for their use, any\r\nterritories, lands, sums of money, or other donations, which may be\r\noffered in consequence of treaty or otherwise. It was necessary to\r\ndistinguish this from every other species of acceptance, because many\r\noccasions occurred in which fines were paid to the Company in\r\nconsequence of treaties; and it was necessary to authorize the receipt\r\nof the same in the Company's treasury, as an open and known proceeding.\r\nIt was never dreamed that this should justify the taking of bribes,\r\nprivately and clandestinely, by the Governor, or any other servant of\r\nthe Company, for the purpose of its future application to the Company's\r\nuse. It is declared that all such bribes and money received should be\r\nthe property of the Company. And why? As a means of recovering them out\r\nof the corrupt hands that had taken them. And therefore this was not a\r\nlicense for bribery, but a prohibitory and penal clause, providing the\r\nmeans of coercion, and making the prohibition stronger. Now Mr. Hastings\r\nhas found out that this very coercive clause, which was made in order to\r\nenable his superiors to get at him and punish him for bribery, is a\r\nlicense for him to receive bribes. He is not only a practitioner of\r\nbribery, but a professor, a doctor upon the subject. His opinion is,\r\nthat he might take presents or bribes to himself; he considers the penal\r\nclause which the Company attached to their prohibition, and by which all\r\nsuch bribes are constructively declared to be theirs, in order to\r\nrecover them out of his hands, as a license to receive bribes, to extort\r\nmoney; and he goes with the very prohibition in his hand, the very\r\nmeans by which he was to be restrained, to exercise an unlimited\r\nbribery, peculation, and extortion over the unhappy natives of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe moment he finds that the Company has got a scent of any one of his\r\nbribes, he comes forward and says, \"To be sure, I took it as a bribe; I\r\nadmit the party gave me it as a bribe: I concealed it for a time,\r\nbecause I thought it was for the interest of the Company to conceal it;\r\nbut I had a secret intention, in my own mind, of applying it to their\r\nservice: you shall have it; but you shall have it as I please, and when\r\nI please; and this bribe becomes sanctified the moment I think fit to\r\napply it to your service.\" Now can it be supposed that the India\r\nCompany, or that the act of Parliament, meant, by declaring that the\r\nproperty taken by a corrupt servant, contrary to the true intent of his\r\ncovenant, was theirs, to give a license to take such property,--and that\r\none mode of obtaining a revenue was by the breach of the very covenants\r\nwhich were meant to prevent extortion, peculation, and corruption? What\r\nsort of body is the India Company, which, coming to the verge of\r\nbankruptcy by the robbery of half the world, is afterwards to subsist\r\nupon the alms of peculation and bribery, to have its strength recruited\r\nby the violation of the covenants imposed upon its own servants? It is\r\nan odd sort of body to be so fed and so supported. This new constitution\r\nof revenue that he has made is indeed a very singular contrivance. It is\r\na revenue to be collected by any officer of the Company, (for they are\r\nall alike forbidden, and all alike permitted,)--to be collected by any\r\nperson, from any person, at any time, in any proportion, by any means,\r\nand in any way he pleases; and to be accounted for, or not to be\r\naccounted for, at the pleasure of the collector, and, if applied to\r\ntheir use, to be applied at his discretion, and not at the discretion of\r\nhis employers. I will venture to say that such a system of revenue never\r\nwas before thought of. The next part is an exchequer, which he has\r\nformed, corresponding with it. You will find the board of exchequer made\r\nup of officers ostensibly in the Company's service, of their public\r\naccountant and public treasurer, whom Mr. Hastings uses as an accountant\r\nand treasurer of bribes, accountable, not to the Company, but to\r\nhimself, acting in no public manner, and never acting but upon his\r\nrequisition, concealing all his frauds and artifices to prevent\r\ndetection and discovery. In short, it is an exchequer in which, if I may\r\nbe permitted to repeat the words I made use of on a former occasion,\r\nextortion is the assessor, in which fraud is the treasurer, confusion\r\nthe accountant, oblivion the remembrancer. That these are not mere\r\nwords, I will exemplify as I go through the detail: I will show you that\r\nevery one of the things I have stated are truths, in fact, and that\r\nthese men are bound by the condition of their recognized fidelity to Mr.\r\nHastings to keep back his secrets, to change the accounts, to alter the\r\nitems, to make him debtor or creditor at pleasure, and by that means to\r\nthrow the whole system of the Company's accounts into confusion.\r\n\r\nI have shown the impossibility of the Company's having intended to\r\nauthorize such a revenue, much less such a constitution of it as Mr.\r\nHastings has drawn from the very prohibitions of bribery, and such an\r\nexchequer as he has formed upon the principles I have stated. You will\r\nnot dishonor the legislature or the Company, be it what it may, by\r\nthinking that either of them could give any sanction to it. Indeed, you\r\nwill not think that such a device could ever enter into the head of any\r\nrational man. You are, then, to judge whether it is not a device to\r\ncover guilt, to prevent detection by destroying the means of it; and at\r\nthe same time your Lordships will judge whether the evidence we bring\r\nyou to prove that revenue is a mere pretext be not stronger than the\r\nstrange, absurd reasons which he has produced for forming this new plan\r\nof an exchequer of bribery.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I am now going to read to you a letter in which Mr. Hastings\r\ndeclares his opinion upon the operation of the act, which he now has\r\nfound the means, as he thinks, of evading. My Lords, I will tell you, to\r\nsave you a good deal of reading, that there was certain prize-money\r\ngiven by Sujah ul Dowlah to a body of the Company's troops serving in\r\nthe field,--that this prize-money was to be distributed among them; but\r\nupon application being made to Mr. Hastings for his opinion and sanction\r\nin the distribution, Mr. Hastings at first seemed inclined to give way\r\nto it, but afterwards, upon reading and considering the act of\r\nParliament, before he allowed the soldiery to receive this public\r\ndonation, he thus describes his opinion of the operation of the act.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter from Mr. Hastings to Colonel Champion, 31 August,\r\n1774._\r\n\r\n\"Upon a reference to the new act of Parliament, I was much disappointed\r\nand sorry to find that our intentions were entirely defeated by a clause\r\nin the act, (to be in force after the 1st of August, 1774,) which\r\ndivests us of the power to grant, and expressly prohibits the army to\r\nreceive, the Nabob's intended donation. Agreeable to the positive sense\r\nof this clause, notwithstanding it is expressed individually, there is\r\nnot a doubt but the army is included with all other persons in the\r\nprohibition from receiving presents or donations; a confirmation of\r\nwhich is, that in the clause of exceptions, wherein 'counsellors-at-law,\r\nphysicians, surgeons, and chaplains are permitted to receive the fees\r\nannexed to their profession,' no mention whatever is made of any\r\nlatitude given to the army, or any circumstances wherein it would be\r\nallowable for them to receive presents.... This unlucky discovery of an\r\nexclusion by act of Parliament, which admits of no abatement or evasion\r\nwherever its authority extends, renders a revisal of our proceedings\r\nnecessary, and leaves no option to our decision. It is not like the\r\nordinances of the Court of Directors, where a favorable construction may\r\nbe put, and some room is left for the interposition of the authority\r\nvested in ourselves,--but positive and decisive, admitting neither of\r\nrefinement nor misconstruction. I should be happy, if in this instance a\r\nmethod could be devised of setting the act aside, which I should most\r\nwillingly embrace; but, in my opinion, an opposition would be to incur\r\nthe penalty.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see, Mr. Hastings considered this act to be a most\r\nunlucky discovery: indeed, as long as it remained in force, it would\r\nhave been unlucky for him, because it would have destroyed one of the\r\nprincipal sources of his illegal profits. Why does he consider it\r\nunlucky? Because it admits of no reservation, no exception, no\r\nrefinement whatever, but is clear, positive, decisive. Now in what case\r\nwas it that Mr. Hastings made this determination? In the case of a\r\ndonation publicly offered to an army serving in the field by a prince\r\nthen independent of the Company. If ever there was a circumstance in\r\nwhich any refinement, any favorable construction of the act could be\r\nused, it was in favor of a body of men serving in the field, fighting\r\nfor their country, spilling their blood for it, suffering all the\r\ninconveniences of that climate. It was undoubtedly voluntarily offered\r\nto them by the party, in the height of victory, and enriched by the\r\nplunder of whole provinces. I believe your Lordships will agree with me,\r\nthat, if any relaxation, any evasion, of an act of Parliament could be\r\nallowed, if the intention of the legislature could for a moment be\r\ntrifled with, or supposed for a moment doubtful, it was in this\r\ninstance; and yet, upon the rigor of the act, Mr. Hastings refuses that\r\narmy the price of their blood, money won solely almost by their arms for\r\na prince who had acquired millions by their bravery, fidelity, and\r\nsufferings. This was the case in which Mr. Hastings refused a public\r\ndonation to the army; and from that day to this they have never received\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIf the receipt of this public donation could be thus forbidden, whence\r\nhas Mr. Hastings since learned that he may privately take money, and\r\ntake it not only from princes, and persons in power, and abounding in\r\nwealth, but, as we shall prove, from persons in a comparative degree of\r\npenury and distress? that he could take it from persons in office and\r\ntrust, whose power gave them the means of ruining the people for the\r\npurpose of enabling themselves to pay it? Consider in what a situation\r\nthe Company must be, if the Governor-General can form such a secret\r\nexchequer of direct bribes, given _eo nomine_ as bribes, and accepted as\r\nsuch, by the parties concerned in the transaction, to be discovered only\r\nby himself, and with only the inward reservation that I have spoken of.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, if Mr. Hastings should die without having made a\r\ndiscovery of all his bribes, or if any other servant of the Company\r\nshould imitate his example without his heroic good intentions in doing\r\nsuch villanous acts, how is the Company to recover the bribe-money? The\r\nreceivers need not divulge it till they think fit; and the moment an\r\ninformer comes, that informer is ruined. He comes, for instance, to the\r\nGovernor-General and Council, and charges, say, not Mr. Hastings, but\r\nthe head of the Board of Revenue, with receiving a bribe. \"Receive a\r\nbribe? So I did; but it was with an intention of applying it to the\r\nCompany's service. There I nick the informer: I am beforehand with him:\r\nthe bribe is sanctified by my inward jesuitical intention. I will make a\r\nmerit of it with the Company. I have received 40,000_l._ as a bribe;\r\nthere it is for you: I am acquitted; I am a meritorious servant: let the\r\ninformer go and seek his remedy as he can.\" Now, if an informer is once\r\ninstructed that a person who receives bribes can turn them into merit,\r\nand take away his action from him, do you think that you ever will or\r\ncan discover any one bribe? But what is still worse, by this method\r\ndisclose but one bribe, and you secure all the rest that you possibly\r\ncan receive upon any occasion. For instance, strong report prevails that\r\na bribe of 40,000_l._ has been given, and the receiver expects that\r\ninformation will be laid against him. He acknowledges that he has\r\nreceived a bribe of 40,000_l._, but says that it was for the service of\r\nthe Company, and that it is carried to their account. And thus, by\r\nstating that he has taken some money which he has accounted for, but\r\nconcealing from whom that money came, which is exactly Mr. Hastings's\r\ncase, if at last an information should be laid before the Company of a\r\nspecific bribe having been received of 40,000_l._, it is said by the\r\nreceiver, \"Lord! this is the 40,000_l._ I told you of: it is broken into\r\nfragments, paid by instalments; and you have taken it and put it into\r\nyour own coffers.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, suppose him to take it through the hand of an agent, such as\r\nGunga Govind Sing, and that this agent, who, as we have lately\r\ndiscovered, out of a bribe of 40,000_l._, which Mr. Hastings was to have\r\nreceived, kept back half of it, falls into their debt like him: I desire\r\nto know what the Company can do in such a case. Gunga Govind Sing has\r\nentered into no covenants with the Company. There is no trace of his\r\nhaving this money, except what Mr. Hastings chooses to tell. If he is\r\ncalled upon to refund it to the Company, he may say he never received\r\nit, that he was never ordered to extort this money from the people; or\r\nif he was under any covenant not to take money, he may set up this\r\ndefence: \"I am forbidden to receive money; and I will not make a\r\ndeclaration which will subject me to penalties\": or he may say in India,\r\nbefore the Supreme Court, \"I have paid the bribe all to Mr. Hastings\";\r\nand then there must be a bill and suit there, a bill and suit here, and\r\nby that means, having one party on one side the water and the other\r\nparty on the other, the Company may never come to a discovery of it. And\r\nthat in fact this is the way in which one of his great bribe-agents has\r\nacted I shall prove to your Lordships by evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings had squeezed out of a miserable country a bribe of\r\n40,000_l._, of which he was enabled to bring to the account of the\r\nCompany only 20,000_l._, and of which we should not even have known the\r\nexistence, if the inquiries pursued with great diligence by the House of\r\nCommons had not extorted the discovery: and even now that we know the\r\nfact, we can never get at the money; the Company can never receive it;\r\nand before the House had squeezed out of him that some such money had\r\nbeen received, he never once told the Court of Directors that his black\r\nbribe-agent, whom he recommended to their service, had cheated both them\r\nand him of 20,000_l._ out of the fund of the bribe-revenue. If it be\r\nasked, Where is the record of this? Record there is none. In what office\r\nis it entered? It is entered in no office; it is mentioned as privately\r\nreceived for the Company's benefit: and you shall now further see what a\r\ncharming office of receipt and account this new exchequer of Mr.\r\nHastings's is.\r\n\r\nFor there is another and a more serious circumstance attending this\r\nbusiness. Every one knows, that, by the law of this, and, I believe, of\r\nevery country, any money which is taken illegally from any person, as\r\nevery bribe or sum of money extorted or paid without consideration is,\r\nbelongs to the person who paid it, and he may bring his action for it,\r\nand recover it. Then see how the Company stands. The Company receives a\r\nbribe of 40,000_l._ by Mr. Hastings; it is carried to its account; it\r\nturns bribery into a revenue; it sanctifies it. In the mean time, the\r\nman from whom this money is illegally taken sues Mr. Hastings. Must not\r\nhe recover of Mr. Hastings? Then, if so, must not Mr. Hastings recover\r\nit again from the Company? The Company undoubtedly is answerable for it.\r\nAnd here is a revenue which every man who has paid it may drag out of\r\nthe treasury again. Mr. Hastings's donations of his bribes to the\r\ntreasury are liable to be torn from it at pleasure by every man who\r\ngives the money. First it may be torn from him who receives it; and then\r\nhe may recover it from the treasury, to which he has given it.\r\n\r\nBut admitting that the taking of bribes can be sanctified by their\r\nbecoming the property of the Company, it may still be asked, For what\r\nend and purpose has the Company covenanted with Mr. Hastings that money\r\ntaken extorsively shall belong to the Company? Is it that satisfaction\r\nand reparation may be awarded against the said Warren Hastings to the\r\nsaid Company for their own benefit? No: it is for the benefit of the\r\ninjured persons; and it is to be carried to the Company's account, \"but\r\nin trust, nevertheless, and to the intent that the said Company may and\r\ndo render and pay over the moneys received or recovered by them to the\r\nparties injured or defrauded, which the said Company accordingly hereby\r\nagree and covenant to do.\" Now here is a revenue to be received by Mr.\r\nHastings for the Company's use, applied at his discretion to that use,\r\nand which the Company has previously covenanted to restore to the\r\npersons that are injured and damaged. This is a revenue which is to be\r\ntorn away by the action of any person,--a revenue which they must\r\nreturn back to the person complaining, as they in justice ought to do:\r\nfor no nation ever avowed making a revenue out of bribery and\r\npeculation. They are, then, to restore it back again. But how can they\r\nrestore it? Mr. Hastings has applied it: he has given it in presents to\r\nprinces,--laid it out in budgeros,--in pen, ink, and wax,--in salaries\r\nto secretaries: he has laid it out just in any way he pleased: and the\r\nIndia Company, who have covenanted to restore all this money to the\r\npersons from whom it came, are deprived of all means of performing so\r\njust a duty. Therefore I dismiss the idea that any man so acting could\r\nhave had a good intention in his mind: the supposition is too weak,\r\nsenseless, and absurd. It was only in a desperate cause that he made a\r\ndesperate attempt: for we shall prove that he never made a disclosure\r\nwithout thinking that a discovery had been previously made or was likely\r\nto be made, together with an exposure of all the circumstances of his\r\nwicked and abominable concealment.\r\n\r\nYou will see the history of this new scheme of bribery, by which Mr.\r\nHastings contrived by avowing some bribes to cover others, attempted to\r\noutface his delinquency, and, if possible, to reconcile a weak breach of\r\nthe laws with a sort of spirited observance of them, and to become\r\ninfamous for the good of his country.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of this practice of bribery was in a letter of the\r\n29th of November, 1780. The cause which led to the discovery was a\r\ndispute between him and Mr. Francis at the board, in consequence of a\r\nvery handsome offer made by Mr. Hastings to the board relative to a\r\nmeasure proposed by him, to which he found one objection to be the\r\nmoney that it would cost. He made the most generous and handsome offer,\r\nas it stands upon record, that perhaps any man ever made,--namely, that\r\nhe would defray the expense out of his own private cash, and that he had\r\ndeposited with the treasurer two lac of rupees. This was in June, 1780,\r\nand Mr. Francis soon after returned to Europe. I need not inform your\r\nLordships, that Mr. Hastings had before this time been charged with\r\nbribery and peculation by General Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr.\r\nFrancis. He suspected that Mr. Francis, then going to Europe, would\r\nconfirm this charge by the suspicious nature and circumstances of this\r\ngenerous offer; and this suspicion was increased by the connection which\r\nhe supposed, and which we can prove he thought, Mr. Francis had with\r\nCheyt Sing. Apprehending, therefore, that he might discover and bring\r\nthe bribe to light some way or other, he resolved to anticipate any such\r\ndiscovery by declaring, upon the 29th of November, that this money was\r\nnot his own. I will mention to your Lordships hereafter the\r\ncircumstances of this money. He says, \"My present reason for adverting\r\nto my conduct,\" (that is, his offer of two lac of rupees out of his own\r\nprivate cash for the Company's service, upon the 26th of June, 1780,)\r\n\"on the occasion I have mentioned, is to obviate the false conclusions\r\nor purposed misrepresentations which may be made of it, either as an\r\nartifice of ostentation or as the effect of corrupt influence, by\r\nassuring you that the money, by whatever means it came into your\r\npossession, was not my own,--that I had myself no right to it, nor would\r\nor could have received it, but for the occasion, which prompted me to\r\navail myself of the accidental means which were at that instant\r\nafforded me of accepting and converting it to the property and use of\r\nthe Company: and with this brief apology I shall dismiss the subject.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see what an account Mr. Hastings has given of some obscure\r\ntransaction by which he contradicts the record. For, on the 26th of\r\nJune, he generously, nobly, full of enthusiasm for their service, offers\r\nto the Company money of his own. On the 29th of November he tells the\r\nCourt of Directors that the money he offered on the former day was not\r\nhis own,--that his assertion was totally false,--that the money was not\r\nhis,--that he had no right to receive it,--and that he would not have\r\nreceived it, but for the occasion, which prompted him to avail himself\r\nof the accidental means which at that instant offered.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account sent by their Governor in India, acting as an\r\naccountant, to the Company,--a company with whom everything is matter of\r\naccount. He tells them, indeed, that the sum he had offered was not his\r\nown,--that he had no right to it,--and that he would not have taken it,\r\nif he had not been greatly tempted by the occasion; but he never tells\r\nthem by what means he came at it, the person from whom he received it,\r\nthe occasion upon which he received it, (whether justifiable or not,) or\r\nany one circumstance under heaven relative to it. This is a very\r\nextraordinary account to give to the public of a sum which we find to be\r\nsomewhere above twenty thousand pounds, taken by Mr. Hastings in some\r\nway or other. He set the Company blindly groping in the dark by the very\r\npretended light, the ignis-fatuus, which he held out to them: for at\r\nthat time all was in the dark, and in a cloud: and this is what Mr.\r\nHastings calls _information_ communicated to the Company on the subject\r\nof these bribes.\r\n\r\nYou have heard of obscurity illustrated by a further\r\nobscurity,--_obscurum per obscurius_. He continues to tell\r\nthem,--\"Something of affinity to this anecdote may appear in the first\r\naspect of another transaction, which I shall proceed to relate, and of\r\nwhich it is more immediately my duty to inform you.\" He then tells them\r\nthat he had contrived to give a sum of money to the Rajah of Berar, and\r\nthe account he gives of that proceeding is this. \"We had neither money\r\nto spare, nor, in the apparent state of that government in its relation\r\nto ours, would it have been either prudent or consistent with our public\r\ncredit to have afforded it. It was, nevertheless, my decided opinion\r\nthat some aid should be given, not less as a necessary relief than as an\r\nindication of confidence, and a return for the many instances of\r\nsubstantial kindness which we had within the course of the two last\r\nyears experienced from the government of Berar. I had an assurance that\r\nsuch a proposal would receive the acquiescence of the board; but I knew\r\nthat it would not pass without opposition, and it would have become\r\npublic, which might have defeated its purpose. Convinced of the\r\nnecessity of the expedient, and assured of the sincerity of the\r\ngovernment of Berar, from evidences of stronger proof to me than I could\r\nmake them appear to the other members of the board, I resolved to adopt\r\nit and take the entire responsibility of it upon myself. In this mode a\r\nless considerable sum would suffice. I accordingly caused three lac of\r\nrupees to be delivered to the minister of the Rajah of Berar resident in\r\nCalcutta. He has transmitted it to Cuttack. Two thirds of this sum I\r\nhave raised by my own credit, and shall charge it in my official\r\naccounts; the other third I have supplied from the cash in my hands\r\nbelonging to the Honorable Company.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see in this business another mode which he has of\r\naccounting with the Company, and informing them of his bribe. He begins\r\nhis account of this transaction by saying that it has something of\r\naffinity to the last anecdote,--meaning the account of the first bribe.\r\nAn anecdote is made a head of an account; and this, I believe, is what\r\nnone of your Lordships ever have heard of before,--and I believe it is\r\nyet to be learned in this commercial nation, a nation of accurate\r\ncommercial account. The account he gives of the first is an anecdote;\r\nand what is his account of the second? A relation of an anecdote: not a\r\nnear relation, but something of affinity,--a remote relation, cousin\r\nthree or four times removed, of the half-blood, or something of that\r\nkind, to this anecdote: and he never tells them any circumstance of it\r\nwhatever of any kind, but that it has some affinity to the former\r\nanecdote. But, my Lords, the thing which comes to some degree of\r\nclearness is this, that he did give money to the Rajah of Berar. And\r\nyour Lordships will be so good as to advert carefully to the proportions\r\nin which he gave it. He did give him two lac of rupees of money raised\r\nby his own credit, his own money; and the third he advanced out of the\r\nCompany's money in his hands. He might have taken the Company's money\r\nundoubtedly, fairly, openly, and held it in his hands, for a hundred\r\npurposes; and therefore he does not tell them that even that third was\r\nmoney he had obtained by bribery and corruption. No: he says it is money\r\nof the Company's, which he had in his hand. So that you must get\r\nthrough a long train of construction before you ascertain that this sum\r\nwas what it turns out to be, a bribe, which he retained for the Company.\r\nYour Lordships will please to observe, as I proceed, the nature of this\r\npretended generosity in Mr. Hastings. He is always generous in the same\r\nway. As he offered the whole of his first bribe as his own money, and\r\nafterward acknowledged that no part of it was his own, so he is now\r\ngenerous again in this latter transaction,--in which, however, he shows\r\nthat he is neither generous nor just. He took the first money without\r\nright, and he did not apply it to the very service for which it was\r\npretended to be taken. He then tells you of another anecdote, which, he\r\nsays, has an affinity to that anecdote, and here he is generous again.\r\nIn the first he appears to be generous and just, because he appears to\r\ngive his own money, which he had a right to dispose of; then he tells\r\nyou he is neither generous nor just, for he had taken money he had no\r\nright to, and did not apply it to the service for which he pretended to\r\nhave received it. And now he is generous again, because he gives two lac\r\nof his own money,--and just, because he gives one lac which belonged to\r\nthe Company; but there is not an idea suggested from whom he took it.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed, my Lords. In this letter he tells you he had given two\r\nthirds his own money and one third the Company's money. So it stood upon\r\nthe 29th of November, 1780. On the 5th of January following we see the\r\nbusiness take a totally different turn; and then Mr. Hastings calls for\r\nthree Company's bonds, upon two different securities, antedated to the\r\n1st and 2d of October, for the three lac, which he before told them was\r\ntwo thirds his own money and one third the Company's. He now declares\r\nthe whole of it to be his own, and he thus applies by letter to the\r\nboard, of which he himself was a majority.\r\n\r\n     \"Honorable Sir and Sirs,--Having had occasion to disburse the sum\r\n     of three lacs of sicca rupees on account of secret services, which\r\n     having been advanced from my own private cash, I request that the\r\n     same may be repaid to me in the following manner.\r\n\r\n     \"A bond to be granted me upon the terms of the second loan, bearing\r\n     date from 1st October, for one lac of sicca rupees.\r\n\r\n     \"A bond to be granted me upon the terms of the first loan, bearing\r\n     date from 1st October, for one lac of sicca rupees.\"\r\n\r\n     \"A bond to be granted me upon the terms of the first loan, bearing\r\n     date from the 2d October, for one lac of sicca rupees.\"\r\n\r\nHere are two accounts, one of which must be directly and flatly false:\r\nfor he could not have given two thirds his own, and have supplied the\r\nother third from money of the Company's, and at the same time have\r\nadvanced the whole as his own. He here goes the full length of the\r\nfraud: he declares that it is all his own,--so much his own that he does\r\nnot trust the Company with it, and actually takes their bonds as a\r\nsecurity for it, bearing an interest to be paid to him when he thinks\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nThus it remained from the 5th of January, 1781, till 16th December,\r\n1782, when this business takes another turn, and in a letter of his to\r\nthe Company these bonds become all their own. All the money advanced is\r\nnow, all of it, the Company's money. First he says two thirds were his\r\nown; next, that the whole is his own; and the third account is, that the\r\nwhole is the Company's, and he will account to them for it.\r\n\r\nNow he has accompanied this account with another very curious one. For\r\nwhen you come to look into the particulars of it, you will find there\r\nare three bonds declared to be the Company's bonds, and which refer to\r\nthe former transactions, namely, the money for which he had taken the\r\nbonds; but when you come to look at the numbers of them, you will find\r\nthat one of the three bonds which he had taken as his own disappears,\r\nand another bond, of another date, and for a much larger sum, is\r\nsubstituted in its place, of which he had never mentioned anything\r\nwhatever. So that, taking his first account, that two thirds is his own\r\nmoney, then that it is all his own, in the third that it is all the\r\nCompany's money, by a fourth account, given in a paper describing the\r\nthree bonds, you will find that there is one lac which he does not\r\naccount for, but substitutes in its place a bond before taken as his\r\nown. He sinks and suppresses one bond, he gives two bonds to the\r\nCompany, and to supply the want of the third, which he suppresses, he\r\nbrings forward a bond for another sum, of another date, which he had\r\nnever mentioned before. Here, then, you have four different accounts: if\r\nany one of them is true, every one of the other three is totally false.\r\nSuch a system of cogging, such a system of fraud, such a system of\r\nprevarication, such a system of falsehood, never was, I believe, before\r\nexhibited in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, why did he take bonds at all from the Company for\r\nthe money that was their own? I must be cautious how I charge a legal\r\ncrime. I will not charge it to be forgery, to take a bond from the\r\nCompany for money which was their own. He was employed to make out bonds\r\nfor the Company, to raise money on their credit. He pretends he lent\r\nthem a sum of money, which was not his to lend: but he gives their own\r\nmoney to them as his own, and takes a security for it. I will not say\r\nthat it is a forgery, but I am sure it is an offence as grievous,\r\nbecause it is as much a cheat as a forgery, with this addition to it,\r\nthat the person so cheating is in a trust; he violates that trust, and\r\nin so doing he defrauds and falsifies the whole system of the Company's\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nI have only to show what his own explanation of all these actions was,\r\nbecause it supersedes all observation of mine. Hear what prevaricating\r\nguilt says for the falsehood and delusion which had been used to cover\r\nit; and see how he plunges deeper and deeper upon every occasion. This\r\nexplanation arose out of another memorable bribe, which I must now beg\r\nleave to state to your Lordships.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the receipt of the former bribes, good fortune, as\r\ngood things seldom come singly, is kind to him; and when he went up and\r\nhad nearly ruined the Company's affairs in Oude and Benares, he received\r\na present of 100,000_l._ sterling, or thereabouts. He received bills for\r\nit in September, 1781, and he gives the Company an account of it in\r\nJanuary, 1782. Remark in what manner the account of this money was\r\ngiven, and the purposes for which he intends to apply it. He says, in\r\nthis letter, \"I received the offer of a considerable sum of money, both\r\non the Nabob's part and that of his ministers, as a present to myself,\r\nnot to the Company: I accepted it without hesitation, and gladly, being\r\nentirely destitute both of means and credit, whether for your service or\r\nthe relief of my own necessities.\" My Lords, upon this you shall hear a\r\ncomment, made by some abler persons than me. This donation was not made\r\nin species, but in bills upon the house of Gopaul Doss, who was then a\r\nprisoner in the hands of Cheyt Sing. After mentioning that he took this\r\npresent for the Company, and for their exigencies, and partly for his\r\nown necessities, and in consequence of the distress of both, he desires\r\nthe Company, in the moment of this their greatest distress, to award it\r\nto him, and therefore he ends, \"If you should adjudge the deposit to me,\r\nI shall consider it as the most honorable approbation and reward of my\r\nlabors: and I wish to owe my fortune to your bounty. I am now in the\r\nfiftieth year of my life: I have passed thirty-one years in the service\r\nof the Company, and the greatest part of that time in employments of the\r\nhighest trust. My conscience allows me boldly to claim the merit of zeal\r\nand integrity; nor has fortune been unpropitious to their exertions. To\r\nthese qualities I bound my pretensions. I shall not repine, if you shall\r\ndeem otherwise of my services; nor ought your decision, however it may\r\ndisappoint my hope of a retreat adequate to the consequence and\r\nelevation of the office which I now possess, to lessen my gratitude for\r\nhaving been so long permitted to hold it, since it has at least enabled\r\nme to lay up a provision with which I can be contented in a more humble\r\nstation.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here your Lordships will be pleased incidentally to remark the\r\ncircumstance of his condition of life and his fortune, to which he\r\nappeals, and upon account of which he desires this money. Your\r\nLordships will remember that in 1773 he said, (and this I stated to you\r\nfrom himself,) that, if he held his then office for a very few years, he\r\nshould be enabled to lay by an ample provision for his retreat. About\r\nnine years after that time, namely, in the month of January, 1782, he\r\nfinds himself rather pinched with want, but, however, not in so bad a\r\nway but that the holding of his office had enabled him to lay up a\r\nprovision with which he could be contented in a more humble station. He\r\nwishes to have affluence; he wishes to have dignity; he wishes to have\r\nconsequence and rank: but he allows that he has competence. Your\r\nLordships will see afterwards how miserably his hopes were disappointed:\r\nfor the Court of Directors, receiving this letter from Mr. Hastings, did\r\ndeclare, that they could not give it to him, because the act had ordered\r\nthat \"no fees of office, perquisites, emoluments, or advantages\r\nwhatsoever, should be accepted, received, or taken by such\r\nGovernor-General and Council, or any of them, in any manner or on any\r\naccount or pretence whatsoever\"; \"and as the same act further directs,\r\n'that no Governor-General, or any of the Council, shall directly take,\r\naccept, or receive, of or from any person or persons, in any manner or\r\non any account whatsoever, any present, gift, donation, gratuity, or\r\nreward, pecuniary or otherwise, or any promise or engagement for any\r\npresent, gift, donation, gratuity, or reward,' we cannot, were we so\r\ninclined, decree the amount of this present to the Governor-General. And\r\nit is further enacted, 'that any such present, gift, gratuity, donation,\r\nor reward, accepted, taken, or received, shall be deemed and construed\r\nto have been received to and for the sole use of the Company.'\" And\r\ntherefore they resolved, most unjustly and most wickedly, to keep it to\r\nthemselves. The act made it in the first instance the property of the\r\nCompany, and they would not give it him. And one should think this, with\r\nhis own former construction of the act, would have made him cautious of\r\ntaking bribes. You have seen what weight it had with him to stop the\r\ncourse of bribes which he was in such a career of taking in every place\r\nand with both hands.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have now before you this hundred thousand pounds,\r\ndisclosed in a letter from Patna, dated the 20th January, 1782. You find\r\nmystery and concealment in every one of Mr. Hastings's discoveries. For\r\n(which is a curious part of it) this letter was not sent to the Court of\r\nDirectors in their packet regularly, but transmitted by Major Fairfax,\r\none of his agents, to Major Scott, another of his agents, to be\r\ndelivered to the Company. Why was this done? Your Lordships will judge,\r\nfrom that circuitous mode of transmission, whether he did not thereby\r\nintend to leave some discretion in his agent to divulge it or not. We\r\nare told he did not; but your Lordships will believe that or not,\r\naccording to the nature of the fact. If he had been anxious to make this\r\ndiscovery to the Directors, the regular way would have been to send his\r\nletter to the Directors immediately in the packet: but he sent it in a\r\nbox to an agent; and that agent, upon due discretion, conveyed it to the\r\nCourt of Directors. Here, however, he tells you nothing about the\r\npersons from whom he received this money, any more than he had done\r\nrespecting the two former sums.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of May following the date of this Patna letter he came down to\r\nCalcutta with a mind, as he himself describes it, greatly agitated. All\r\nhis hope of plundering Benares had totally failed. The produce of the\r\nrobbing of the Begums, in the manner your Lordships have heard, was all\r\ndissipated to pay the arrears of the armies: there was no fund left. He\r\nfelt himself agitated and full of dread, knowing that he had been\r\nthreatened with having his place taken from him several times, and that\r\nhe might be called home to render an account. He had heard that\r\ninquiries had begun in a menacing form in Parliament; and though at that\r\ntime Bengal was not struck at, there was a charge of bribery and\r\npeculation brought against the Governor of Madras. With this dread, with\r\na mind full of anxiety and perturbation, he writes a letter, as he\r\npretends, on the 22d of May, 1782. Your Lordships will remark, that,\r\nwhen he came down to Calcutta from his expedition up the country, he did\r\nnot till the 22d of May give any account whatever of these\r\ntransactions,--and that this letter, or pretended letter, of the 22d of\r\nMay was not sent till the 16th of December following. We shall clearly\r\nprove that he had abundant means of sending it, and by various ways,\r\nbefore the 16th of December, 1782, when he inclosed in another letter\r\nthat of the 22d of May. This is the letter of discovery; this is the\r\nletter by which his breast was to be laid open to his employers, and all\r\nthe obscurity of his transactions to be elucidated. Here are indeed new\r\ndiscoveries, but they are like many new-discovered lands, exceedingly\r\ninhospitable, very thinly inhabited, and producing nothing to gratify\r\nthe curiosity of the human mind.\r\n\r\nThis letter is addressed to the Honorable the Court of Directors, dated\r\nFort William, 22d May, 1782. He tells them he had promised to account\r\nfor the ten lacs of rupees which he had received, and this promise, he\r\nsays, he now performs, and that he takes that opportunity of accounting\r\nwith them likewise for several other sums which he had received. His\r\nwords are,--\r\n\r\n\"This promise I now perform, and, deeming it consistent with the spirit\r\nof it, I have added such other sums as have been occasionally converted\r\nto the Company's property through my means, in consequence of the like\r\noriginal destination. Of the second of these sums you have already been\r\nadvised in a letter which I had the honor to address the Honorable Court\r\nof Directors, dated 29th November, 1780. Both this and the third article\r\nwere paid immediately to the treasury, by my order to the sub-treasurer\r\nto receive them on the Company's account, but never passed through my\r\nhands. The three sums for which bonds were granted were in like manner\r\npaid to the Company's treasury, without passing through my hands, but\r\ntheir _application_ was not specified. The sum of 50,000 current rupees\r\nwas received while I was on my journey to Benares, and applied as\r\nexpressed in the account.\r\n\r\n\"As to the manner in which these sums have been expended, the reference\r\nwhich I have made of it in the accompanying account, to the several\r\naccounts in which they are credited, renders any other specification of\r\nit unnecessary,--_besides_ that these accounts either have or will have\r\nreceived a much stronger authentication than any that I could give to\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\nI wish your Lordships to attend to the next paragraph, which is meant by\r\nhim to explain why he took bribes at all,--why he took bonds for some of\r\nthem, as moneys of his own, and not moneys of the Company,--why he\r\nentered some upon the Company's accounts, and why of the others he\r\nrenders no account at all. Light, however, will beam upon you as we\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\"Why these sums were taken by me,--why they were, except the second,\r\nquietly transferred to the Company's use,--why bonds were taken for the\r\nfirst, and not for the rest,--might, were this matter exposed to the\r\nview of the public, furnish a variety of conjectures, to which it would\r\nbe of little use to reply. Were your Honorable Court to question me on\r\nthese points, I would answer, that the sums were taken for the Company's\r\nbenefit, at times when the Company very much needed them,--that I either\r\nchose to conceal the first receipts from public curiosity by receiving\r\nbonds for the amount, or possibly acted without any studied design which\r\nmy memory could at this distance of time verify, and that I did not\r\nthink it worth my care to observe the same means with the rest. I trust,\r\nHonorable Sirs, to your breasts for a candid interpretation of my\r\nactions,--and assume the freedom to add, that I think myself, on such a\r\nsubject, on such _an occasion_, entitled to it.\"\r\n\r\nLofty, my Lords! You see, that, after the Directors had expected an\r\nexplanation for so long a time, he says, \"Why these sums were taken by\r\nme, and, except the second, quietly transferred to the Company's use, I\r\ncannot tell; why bonds were taken for the first, and not for the rest, I\r\ncannot tell: if this matter were exposed to view, it would furnish a\r\nvariety of conjectures.\" Here is an account which is to explain the most\r\nobscure, the most mysterious, the most evidently fraudulent\r\ntransactions. When asked how he came to take these bonds, how he came\r\nto use these frauds, he tells you he really does not know,--that he\r\nmight have this motive for it, that he might have another motive for\r\nit,--that he wished to conceal it from public curiosity,--but, which is\r\nthe most extraordinary, he is not quite sure that he had any motive for\r\nit at all, which his memory can trace. The whole of this is a period of\r\na year and a half; and here is a man who keeps his account upon\r\nprinciples of whim and vagary. One would imagine he was guessing at some\r\nmotive of a stranger. Why he came to take bonds for money not due to\r\nhim, and why he enters some and not others,--he knows nothing of these\r\nthings: he begs them not to ask about it, because it will be of no use.\r\n\"You foolish Court of Directors may conjecture and conjecture on. You\r\nare asking me why I took bonds to myself for money of yours, why I have\r\ncheated you, why I have falsified my account in such a manner. I will\r\nnot tell you.\"\r\n\r\nIn the satisfaction which he had promised to give them he neither\r\nmentions the persons, the times, the occasions, or motives for any of\r\nhis actions. He adds, \"I did not think it worth my care to observe the\r\nsame means with the rest.\" For some purposes, he thought it necessary to\r\nuse the most complicated and artful concealments; for some, he could not\r\ntell what his motives were; and for others, that it was mere\r\ncarelessness. Here is the exchequer of bribery!--have I falsified any\r\npart of my original stating of it?--an exchequer in which the man who\r\nought to pay receives, the man who ought to give security takes it, the\r\nman who ought to keep an account says he has forgotten; an exchequer in\r\nwhich oblivion was the remembrancer; and, to sum up the whole, an\r\nexchequer into the accounts of which it was useless to inquire. This is\r\nthe manner in which the account of near two hundred thousand pounds is\r\ngiven to the Court of Directors. You can learn nothing in this business\r\nthat is any way distinct, except a premeditated design of a concealment\r\nof his transactions. That is avowed.\r\n\r\nBut there is a more serious thing behind. Who were the instruments of\r\nhis concealment? No other, my Lords, than the Company's public\r\naccountant. That very accountant takes the money, knowing it to be the\r\nCompany's, and that it was only pretended to be advanced by Mr. Hastings\r\nfor the Company's use. He sees Mr. Hastings make out bonds to himself\r\nfor it, and Mr. Hastings makes him enter him as creditor, when in fact\r\nhe was debtor. Thus he debauches the Company's accountant, and makes him\r\nhis confederate. These fraudulent and corrupt acts, covered by false\r\nrepresentations, are proved to be false not by collation with anything\r\nelse, but false by a collation with themselves. This, then, is the\r\naccount, and his explanation of it; and in this insolent, saucy,\r\ncareless, negligent manner, a public accountant like Mr. Hastings, a man\r\nbred up a book-keeper in the Company's service, who ought to be exact,\r\nphysically exact, in his account, has not only been vicious in his own\r\naccount, but made the public accounts vicious and of no value.\r\n\r\nBut there is in this account another curious circumstance with regard to\r\nthe deposit of this sum of money, to which he referred in his first\r\nparagraph of his letter of the 29th of November, 1780. He states that\r\nthis deposit was made and passed into the hands of Mr. Larkins on the\r\n1st of June. It did so; but it is not entered in the Company's accounts\r\ntill November following. Now in all that intermediate space where was\r\nit? what account was there of it? It was entirely a secret between Mr.\r\nLarkins and Mr. Hastings, without a possibility of any one discovering\r\nany particular relative to it. Here is an account of two hundred\r\nthousand pounds received, juggled between the accountant and him,\r\nwithout a trace of it appearing in the Company's books. Some of those\r\ncommittees, to whom, for their diligence at least, I must say the public\r\nhave some obligation, and in return for which they ought to meet with\r\nsome indulgence, examining into all these circumstances, and having\r\nheard that Mr. Hastings had deposited a sum of money in the hands of the\r\nCompany's sub-treasurer in the month of June, sent for the Company's\r\nbooks. They looked over those books, but they did not find the least\r\ntrace of any such sum of money, and not any account of it: nor could\r\nthere be, because it was not paid to the Company's account till the\r\nNovember following. The accountant had received the money, but never\r\nentered it from June till November. Then, at last, have we an account of\r\nit. But was it even then entered regularly upon the Company's accounts?\r\nNo such thing: it is a deposit carried to the Governor-General's credit.\r\n\r\n    [_The entry of the several species in which this deposit was made\r\n    was here read from the Company's General Journal of 1780 and 1781._]\r\n\r\nMy Lords, when this account appears at last, when this money does emerge\r\nin the public accounts, whose is it? Is it the Company's? No: Mr.\r\nHastings's. And thus, if, notwithstanding this obscure account in\r\nNovember, the Directors had claimed and called for this affinity to an\r\nanecdote,--if they had called for this anecdote and examined the\r\naccount,--if they had said, \"We observe here entered two lac and\r\nupwards; come, Mr. Hastings, let us see where this money is,\"--they\r\nwould find that it is Mr. Hastings's money, not the Company's; they\r\nwould find that it is carried to his credit. In this manner he hands\r\nover this sum, telling them, on the 22d of May, 1782, that not only the\r\nbonds were a fraud, but the deposit was a fraud, and that neither bonds\r\nnor deposit did in reality belong to him. Why did he enter it at all?\r\nThen, afterwards, why did he not enter it as the Company's? Why make a\r\nfalse entry, to enter it as his own? And how came he, two years after,\r\nwhen he does tell you that it was the Company's and not his own, to\r\nalter the public accounts? But why did he not tell them at that time,\r\nwhen he pretends to be opening his breast to the Directors, from whom he\r\nreceived it, or say anything to give light to the Company respecting it?\r\nwho, supposing they had the power of dispensing with an act of\r\nParliament, or licensing bribery at their pleasure, might have been\r\nthereby enabled to say, \"Here you ought to have received it,--there it\r\nmight be oppressive and of dreadful example.\"\r\n\r\nI have only to state, that, in this letter, which was pretended to be\r\nwritten on the 22d of May, 1782, your Lordships will observe that he\r\nthinks it his absolute duty (and I wish to press this upon your\r\nLordships, because it will be necessary in a comparison which I shall\r\nhave hereafter to make) to lay open all their affairs to them, to give\r\nthem a full and candid explanation of his conduct, which he afterwards\r\nconfesses he is not able to do. The paragraph has been just read to you.\r\nIt amounts to this: \"I have taken many bribes,--have falsified your\r\naccounts,--have reversed the principle of them in my own favor; I now\r\ndiscover to you all these my frauds, and think myself entitled to your\r\nconfidence upon this occasion.\" Now all the principles of diffidence,\r\nall the principles of distrust, nay, more, all the principles upon which\r\na man may be convicted of premeditated fraud, and deserve the severest\r\npunishment, are to be found in this case, in which he says he holds\r\nhimself to be entitled to their confidence and trust. If any of your\r\nLordships had a steward who told you he had lent you your own money, and\r\nhad taken bonds from you for it, and if he afterwards told you that that\r\nmoney was neither yours nor his, but extorted from your tenants by some\r\nscandalous means, I should be glad to know what your Lordships would\r\nthink of such a steward, who should say, \"I will take the freedom to\r\nadd, that I think myself, on such a subject, on such an occasion,\r\nentitled to your confidence and trust.\" You will observe his cavalier\r\nmode of expression. Instead of his exhibiting the rigor and severity of\r\nan accountant and a book-keeper, you would think that he had been a\r\nreader of sentimental letters; there is such an air of a novel running\r\nthrough the whole, that it adds to the ridicule and nausea of it: it is\r\nan oxymel of squills; there is something to strike you with horror for\r\nthe villany of it, something to strike you with contempt for the fraud\r\nof it, and something to strike you with utter disgust for the vile and\r\nbad taste with which all these base ingredients are assorted.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will see, when the account which is subjoined to this\r\nunaccountable letter comes before you, that, though the Company had\r\ndesired to know the channels through which he got those sums, there is\r\nnot (except by a reference that appears in another place to one of the\r\narticles) one single syllable of explanation given from one end to the\r\nother, there is not the least glimpse of light thrown upon these\r\ntransactions. But we have since discovered from whom he got these\r\nbribes; and your Lordships will be struck with horror, when you hear it.\r\n\r\nI have already remarked to you, that, though this letter is dated upon\r\nthe 22d of May, it was not dispatched for Europe till December\r\nfollowing; and he gets Mr. Larkins, who was his agent and instrument in\r\nfalsifying the Company's accounts, to swear that this letter was written\r\nupon the 22d of May, and that he had no opportunity to send it, but by\r\nthe \"Lively\" in December. On the 16th of that month he writes to the\r\nDirectors, and tells them that he is quite shocked to find he had no\r\nearlier opportunity of making this discovery, which he thought himself\r\nbound to make; though this discovery, respecting some articles of it,\r\nhad now been delayed nearly two years, and though it since appears that\r\nthere were many opportunities, and particularly by the \"Resolution,\" of\r\nsending it. He was much distressed, and found himself in an awkward\r\nsituation, from an apprehension that the Parliamentary inquiry, which he\r\nknew was at this time in progress, might have forced from him this\r\nnotable discovery. He says, \"I do not fear the consequences of any\r\nParliamentary process.\" Indeed, he needed not to fear any Parliamentary\r\ninquiry, if it produced no further discovery than that which your\r\nLordships have in the letter of the 22d of May, and in the accounts\r\nsubjoined to it. He says, that \"the delay is of no public consequence;\r\nbut it has produced a situation which, with respect to myself, I regard\r\nas unfortunate, because it exposes me to the meanest imputation, from\r\nthe occasion which the late Parliamentary inquiries have since\r\nfurnished.\"\r\n\r\nNow here is a very curious letter, that I wish to have read for some\r\nother reasons, which will afterwards appear, but principally at present\r\nfor the purpose of showing you that he held it to be his duty and\r\nthought it to the last degree dishonorable not to give the Company an\r\naccount of those secret bribes: he thought it would reflect upon him,\r\nand ruin his character forever, if this account did not come voluntarily\r\nfrom him, but was extorted by terror of Parliamentary inquiry. In this\r\nletter of the 16th December, 1782, he thus writes.\r\n\r\n\"The delay is of no public consequence, but it has produced a situation\r\nwhich, with respect to myself, I regard as unfortunate; because it\r\nexposes me to the meanest imputation, from the occasion which the late\r\nParliamentary inquiries have since furnished, but which were unknown\r\nwhen my letter was written, and written in the necessary consequence of\r\na promise made to that effect in a former letter to your Honorable\r\nCommittee, dated 20th January last. However, to preclude the possibility\r\nof such reflections from affecting me, I have desired Mr. Larkins, who\r\nwas privy to the whole transaction, to affix to the letter his affidavit\r\nof the date in which it was written. I own I feel most sensibly the\r\nmortification of being reduced to the necessity of using such\r\nprecautions to guard my reputation from dishonor. If I had at any time\r\npossessed that degree of confidence from my immediate employers which\r\nthey never withheld from the meanest of my predecessors, I should have\r\ndisdained to use these attentions. How I have drawn on me a different\r\ntreatment I know not; it is sufficient that I have not merited it. And\r\nin the course of a service of thirty-two years, and ten of these\r\nemployed in maintaining the powers and discharging the duties of the\r\nfirst office of the British government in India, that honorable court\r\nought to know whether I possess the integrity and honor which are the\r\nfirst requisites of such a station. If I wanted these, they have\r\nafforded me but too powerful incentives to suppress the information\r\nwhich I now convey to them through you, and to appropriate to my own use\r\nthe sums which I have already passed to their credit, by the unworthy\r\nand, pardon me, if I add, dangerous, reflections which they have passed\r\nupon me for the first communication of this kind: and your own\r\nexperience will suggest to you, that there are persons who would profit\r\nby such a warning.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the whole of these transactions, which to you, who are accustomed\r\nto view business in an official and regular light, may appear\r\nunprecedented, if not improper, I have but a few short remarks to\r\nsuggest to your consideration.\r\n\r\n\"If I appear in any unfavorable light by these transactions, I resign\r\nthe common and legal security of those who commit crimes or errors. I am\r\nready to answer every particular question that may be put against\r\nmyself, upon honor or upon oath.\r\n\r\n\"The sources from which these reliefs to the public service have come\r\nwould never have yielded them to the Company publicly; and the\r\nexigencies of your service (exigencies created by the exposition of\r\nyour affairs, and faction in your councils) required those supplies.\r\n\r\n\"I could have concealed them, had I had a wrong motive, from yours and\r\nthe public eye forever; and I know that the difficulties to which a\r\nspirit of injustice may subject me for my candor and avowal are greater\r\nthan any possible inconvenience that could have attended the\r\nconcealment, except the dissatisfaction of my own mind. These\r\ndifficulties are but a few of those which I have suffered in your\r\nservice. The applause of my own breast is my surest reward, and was the\r\nsupport of my mind in meeting them. Your applause, and that of my\r\ncountry, are my next wish in life.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will observe at the end of this letter, that this man\r\ndeclares his first applause to be from his own breast, and that he next\r\nwishes to have the applause of his employers. But reversing this, and\r\ntaking their applause first, let us see on what does he ground his hope\r\nof their applause? Was it on his former conduct? No: for he says that\r\nconduct had repeatedly met with their disapprobation. Was it upon the\r\nconfidence which he knew they had in him? No: for he says they gave more\r\nof their confidence to the meanest of his predecessors. Observe, my\r\nLords, the style of insolence he constantly uses with regard to all\r\nmankind. Lord Clive was his predecessor, Governor Cartier was his\r\npredecessor, Governor Verelst was his predecessor: every man of them as\r\ngood as himself: and yet he says the Directors had given \"more of their\r\nconfidence to the _meanest_ of his predecessors.\" But what was to\r\nentitle him to their applause? A clear and full explanation of the\r\nbribes he had taken. Bribes was to be the foundation of their\r\nconfidence in him, and the clear explanation of them was to entitle him\r\nto their applause! Strange grounds to build confidence upon!--the rotten\r\nground of corruption, accompanied with the infamy of its avowal! Strange\r\nground to expect applause!--a discovery which was no discovery at all!\r\nYour Lordships have heard this discovery, which I have not taken upon me\r\nto state, but have read his own letter on the occasion. Has there, at\r\nthis moment, any light broken in upon you concerning this matter?\r\n\r\nBut what does he say to the Directors? He says, \"Upon the whole of these\r\ntransactions, which to you, who are accustomed to view business in an\r\nofficial and regular light, may appear unprecedented, if not improper, I\r\nhave but a few short remarks to suggest to your consideration.\" He looks\r\nupon them and treats them as a set of low mechanical men, a set of\r\nlow-born book-keepers, as base souls, who in an account call for\r\nexplanation and precision. If there is no precision in accounts, there\r\nis nothing of worth in them. You see he himself is an eccentric\r\naccountant, a Pindaric book-keeper, an arithmetician in the clouds. \"I\r\nknow,\" he says, \"what the Directors desire: but they are mean people;\r\nthey are not of elevated sentiments; they are modest; they avoid\r\nostentation in taking of bribes: I therefore am playing cups and balls\r\nwith them, letting them see a little glimpse of the bribes, then\r\ncarrying them fairly away.\" Upon this he founds the applause of his own\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n        Populus me sibilat; at mihi plaudo\r\n    Ipse domi, simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.\r\n\r\nThat private _ipse plaudo_ he may have in this business, which is a\r\nbusiness of money; but the applause of no other human creature will he\r\nhave for giving such an account as he admits this to be,--irregular,\r\nuncertain, problematical, and of which no one can make either head or\r\ntail. He despises us also, who are representatives of the people, and\r\nhave amongst us all the regular officers of finance, for expecting\r\nanything like a regular account from him. He is hurt at it; he considers\r\nit as a cruel treatment of him; he says, \"Have I deserved this\r\ntreatment?\" Observe, my Lords, he had met with no treatment, if\r\ntreatment it may be called, from us, of the kind of which he complains.\r\nThe Court of Directors had, however, in a way shameful, abject, low, and\r\npusillanimous, begged of him, as if they were his dependants, and not\r\nhis masters, to give them some light into the account; they desire a\r\nreceiver of money to tell from whom he received it, and how he applied\r\nit. He answers, They may be hanged for a parcel of mean, contemptible\r\nbook-keepers, and that he will give them no account at all. He says, \"If\r\nyou sue me\"--There is the point: he always takes security in a court of\r\nlaw. He considers his being called upon by these people, to whom he\r\nought as a faithful servant to give an account, and to do which he was\r\nbound by an act of Parliament specially intrusting him with the\r\nadministration of the revenues, as a gross affront. He adds, that he is\r\nready to resign his defence, and to answer upon honor or upon oath.\r\nAnswering upon honor is a strange way they have got in India, as your\r\nLordships may see in the course of this inquiry. But he forgets, that,\r\nbeing the Company's servant, the Company may bring a bill in Chancery\r\nagainst him, and force him upon oath to give an account. He has not,\r\nhowever, given them light enough or afforded them sufficient ground for\r\na fishing bill in Chancery. Yet he says, \"If you call upon me in a\r\nChancery way, or by Common Law, I really will abdicate all forms, and\r\ngive you some account.\" In consequence of this the Company did demand\r\nfrom him an account, regularly, and as fully and formally as if they had\r\ndemanded it in a court of justice. He positively refused to give them\r\nany account whatever; and they have never, to this very day in which we\r\nspeak, had any account that is at all clear or satisfactory. Your\r\nLordships will see, as I go through this scene of fraud, falsification,\r\niniquity, and prevarication, that, in defiance of his promise, which\r\npromise they quote upon him over and over again, he has never given them\r\nany account of this matter.\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say (and the threat is indeed alarming) that by calling\r\nhim to account they may provoke him--to what? \"To appropriate,\" he says,\r\n\"to my own use the sums which I have already passed to your credit, by\r\nthe unworthy and, pardon me, if I add, dangerous, reflections which you\r\nhave passed upon me for the first communication of this kind.\" They\r\npassed no reflections: they said they would neither praise nor blame\r\nhim, but pressed him for an account of a matter which they could not\r\nunderstand: and I believe your Lordships understand it no more than\r\nthey, for it is not in the compass of human understanding to conceive or\r\ncomprehend it. Instead of an account of it, he dares to threaten them:\r\n\"I may be tempted, if you should provoke me, not to be an honest\r\nman,--to falsify your account a second time, and to reclaim those sums\r\nwhich I have passed to your credit,--to alter the account again, by the\r\nassistance of Mr. Larkins.\" What a dreadful declaration is this of his\r\ndominion over the public accounts, and of his power of altering them! a\r\ndeclaration, that, having first falsified those accounts in order to\r\ndeceive them, and afterwards having told them of this falsification in\r\norder to gain credit with them, if they provoke him, he shall take back\r\nthe money he had carried to their account, and make them his debtors for\r\nit! He fairly avows the dominion he has over the Company's accounts; and\r\ntherefore, when he shall hereafter plead the accounts, we shall be able\r\nto rebut that evidence, and say, \"The Company's accounts are corrupted\r\nby you, through your agent, Mr. Larkins; and we give no credit to them,\r\nbecause you not only told the Company you could do so, but we can prove\r\nthat you have actually done it.\" What a strange medley of evasion,\r\npretended discovery, real concealment, fraud, and prevarication appears\r\nin every part of this letter!\r\n\r\nBut admitting this letter to have been written upon the 22d of May, and\r\nkept back to the 16th of December, you would imagine that during all\r\nthat interval of time he would have prepared himself to give some light,\r\nsome illustration of these dark and mysterious transactions, which\r\ncarried fraud upon the very face of them. Did he do so? Not at all. Upon\r\nthe 16th of December, instead of giving them some such clear accounts as\r\nmight have been expected, he falls into a violent passion for their\r\nexpecting them; he tells them it would be dangerous; and he tells them\r\nthey knew who had profited by these transactions: thus, in order to\r\nstrike terror into their breasts, hinting at some frauds which they had\r\npractised or protected. What weight this may have had with them I know\r\nnot; but your Lordships will expect in vain, that Mr. Hastings, after\r\ngiving four accounts, if any one of which is true, the other three must\r\nnecessarily be false,--after having thrown the Company's accounts into\r\nconfusion, and being unable to tell, as he says himself, why he did\r\nso,--will at last give some satisfaction to the Directors, who\r\ncontinued, in a humble, meek way, giving him hints that he ought to do\r\nit.--You have heard nothing yet but the consequences of their refusing\r\nto give him the present of a hundred thousand pounds, which he had taken\r\nfrom the Nabob. They did right to refuse it to him; they did wrong to\r\ntake it to themselves.\r\n\r\nWe now find Mr. Hastings on the river Ganges, in September, 1784,--that\r\nGanges whose purifying water expiates so many sins of the Gentoos, and\r\nwhich, one would think, would have washed Mr. Hastings's hands a little\r\nclean of bribery, and would have rolled down its golden sands like\r\nanother Pactolus. Here we find him discovering another of his bribes.\r\nThis was a bribe taken upon totally a different principle, according to\r\nhis own avowal: it is a bribe not pretended to be received for the use\r\nof the Company,--a bribe taken absolutely entirely for himself. He tells\r\nthem that he had taken between thirty and forty thousand pounds. This\r\nbribe, which, like the former, he had taken without right, he tells them\r\nthat he intends to apply to his own purposes, and he insists upon their\r\nsanction for so doing. He says, he had in vain, upon a former occasion,\r\nappealed to their honor, liberality, and generosity,--that he now\r\nappeals to their justice; and insists upon their decreeing this\r\nbribe--which he had taken without telling them from whom, where, or on\r\nwhat account--to his own use.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships remember, that in the letter which he wrote from Patna,\r\non the 20th of January, 1782, he there states that he was in tolerable\r\ngood circumstances, and that this had arisen from his having continued\r\nlong in their service. Now, he has continued two years longer in their\r\nservice, and he is reduced to beggary! \"This,\" he says, \"is a single\r\nexample of a life spent in the accumulation of crores for your benefit,\r\nand doomed in its close to suffer the extremity of private want, and to\r\nsink in obscurity.\"\r\n\r\nSo far back as in 1773 he thought that he could save an exceeding good\r\nfortune out of his place. In 1782 he says, with gratitude, that he has\r\nmade a decent private competency; but in two years after he sunk to the\r\nextremity of private want. And how does he seek to relieve that want? By\r\ntaking a bribe: bribes are no longer taken by him for the Company's\r\nservice, but for his own. He takes the bribe with an express intention\r\nof keeping it for his own use, and he calls upon the Company for their\r\nsanction. If the money was taken without right, no claim of his could\r\njustify its being appropriated to himself: nor could the Company so\r\nappropriate it; for no man has a right to be generous out of another's\r\ngoods. When he calls upon their justice and generosity, they might\r\nanswer, \"If you have a just demand upon our treasury, state it, and we\r\nwill pay it; if it is a demand upon our generosity, state your merits,\r\nand we will consider them.\" \"But I have paid myself by a bribe; I have\r\ntaken another man's money; and I call upon your justice--to do what? to\r\nrestore it to its owner? no--to allow me to keep it myself.\" Think, my\r\nLords, in what a situation the Company stands! \"I have done a great\r\ndeal for you; this is the jackal's portion; you have been the lion; I\r\nhave been endeavoring to prog for you; I am your bribe-pander, your\r\nfactor of corruption, exposing myself to every kind of scorn and\r\nignominy, to insults even from you. I have been preying and plundering\r\nfor you; I have gone through every stage of licentiousness and lewdness,\r\nwading through every species of dirt and corruption, for your advantage.\r\nI am now sinking into the extremity of private want; do give me\r\nthis--what? money? no, this bribe; rob me the man who gave me this\r\nbribe; vote me--what? money of your own? that would be generous: money\r\nyou owe me? that would be just: no, money which I have extorted from\r\nanother man; and I call upon your justice to give it me.\" This is his\r\nidea of justice. He says, \"I am compelled to depart from that liberal\r\nplan which I originally adopted, and to claim from your justice (for you\r\nhave forbid me to appeal to your generosity) the discharge of a debt\r\nwhich I can with the most scrupulous integrity aver to be justly due,\r\nand which I cannot sustain.\" Now, if any of the Company's servants may\r\nsay, \"I have been extravagant, profuse,--it was all meant for your\r\ngood,--let me prey upon the country at my pleasure,--license my bribes,\r\nfrauds, and peculations, and then you do me justice,\"--what country are\r\nwe in, where these ideas are ideas of generosity and justice?\r\n\r\nIt might naturally be expected that in this letter he would have given\r\nsome account of the person from whom he had taken this bribe. But here,\r\nas in the other cases, he had a most effectual oblivion; the Ganges,\r\nlike Lethe, causes a drowsiness, as you saw in Mr. Middleton; they\r\nrecollect nothing, they know nothing. He has not stated, from that day\r\nto this, from whom he took that money. But we have made the discovery.\r\nAnd such is the use of Parliamentary inquiries, such, too, both to the\r\npresent age and posterity, will be their use, that, if we pursue them\r\nwith the vigor which the great trust justly imposed upon us demands, and\r\nif your Lordships do firmly administer justice upon this man's frauds,\r\nyou will at once put an end to those frauds and prevarications forever.\r\nYour Lordships will see, that, in this inquiry, it is the diligence of\r\nthe House of Commons, which he has the audacity to call _malice_, that\r\nhas discovered and brought to light the frauds which we shall be able to\r\nprove against him.\r\n\r\nI will now read to your Lordships an extract from that stuff, called a\r\ndefence, which he has either written himself or somebody else has\r\nwritten for him, and which he owns or disclaims, just as he pleases,\r\nwhen, under the slow tortures of a Parliamentary impeachment, he\r\ndiscovered at length from whom he got this last bribe.\r\n\r\n\"The last part of the charge states, that, in my letter to the Court of\r\nDirectors of the 21st February, 1784, I have confessed to have received\r\nanother sum of money, the amount of which is not declared, but which,\r\nfrom the application of it, could not be less than thirty-four thousand\r\npounds sterling, &c. In the year 1783, when I was actually in want of a\r\nsum of money for my private expenses, owing to the Company not having at\r\nthat time sufficient cash in their treasury to pay my salary, I borrowed\r\nthree lacs of rupees of Rajah Nobkissin, an inhabitant of Calcutta, whom\r\nI desired to call upon me with a bond properly filled up. He did so; but\r\nat the time I was going to execute it he entreated I would rather\r\naccept the money than execute the bond. I neither accepted the offer nor\r\nrefused it; and my determination upon it remained suspended between the\r\nalternative of keeping the money, as a loan to be repaid, and of taking\r\nit, and applying it, as I had done other sums, to the Company's use. And\r\nthere the matter rested till I undertook my journey to Lucknow, when I\r\ndetermined to accept the money for the Company's use; and these were my\r\nmotives. Having made disbursements from my own cash for services, which,\r\nthough required to enable me to execute the duties of my station, I had\r\nhitherto omitted to enter into my public accounts, I resolved to\r\nreimburse myself in a mode most suitable to the situation of the\r\nCompany's affairs, by charging these disbursements in my durbar accounts\r\nof the present year, and crediting them by a sum privately received,\r\nwhich was this of Nobkissin's. If my claim on the Company were not\r\nfounded in justice, and _bonâ fide_ due, my acceptance of three lacs of\r\nrupees from Nobkissin by no means precludes them from recovering that\r\nsum from me. No member of this Honorable House suspects me, I hope, of\r\nthe meanness and guilt of presenting false accounts.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not _suspect_ him of presenting false accounts: we can prove, we\r\nare now radically proving, that he presents false accounts. We suspect\r\nno man who does not give ground for suspicion; we accuse no man who has\r\nnot given ground for accusation; and we do not attempt to bring before a\r\ncourt of justice any charges which we shall not be able decisively to\r\nprove. This will put an end to all idle prattle of malice, of groundless\r\nsuspicions of guilt, and of ill-founded charges. We come here to bring\r\nthe matter to the test, and here it shall be brought to the test,\r\nbetween the Commons of Great Britain and this East India delinquent. In\r\nhis letter of the 21st of February, 1784, he says he has never benefited\r\nhimself by contingent accounts; and as an excuse for taking this bribe\r\nfrom Nobkissin, which he did not discover at the time, but many years\r\nafterwards, at the bar of the House of Commons, he declares that he\r\nwanted to apply it to the contingent account for his expenses, that is,\r\nfor what he pretended to have laid out for the Company, during a great\r\nnumber of years. He proceeds:--\r\n\r\n\"If it should be objected, that the allowance of these demands would\r\nfurnish a precedent for others of the like kind, I have to remark, that\r\nin their whole amount they are but the aggregate of a contingent account\r\nof twelve years; and if it were to become the practice of those who have\r\npassed their prime of life in your service, and filled, as I have filled\r\nit, the first office of your dominion, to glean from their past accounts\r\nall the articles of expense which their inaccuracy or indifference hath\r\noverlooked, your interests would suffer infinitely less by the precedent\r\nthan by a single example of a life spent in the accumulation of crores\r\nfor your benefit and doomed in its close to suffer the extremity of\r\nprivate want and to sink in obscurity.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the man that has told us at the bar of the House of Commons that\r\nhe never made up any contingent accounts; and yet, as a set-off against\r\nthis bribe, which he received for himself, and never intended to apply\r\nto the current use of the Company, he feigns and invents a claim upon\r\nthem, namely, that he had, without any authority of the Company,\r\nsquandered away in stationery and budgeros, and other idle services, a\r\nsum amounting to 34,000_l._ But was it for the Company's service? Is\r\nthis language to be listened to? \"Everything I thought fit to expend I\r\nhave expended for the Company's service. I intended, indeed, at that\r\ntime, to have been generous. I intended out of my own pocket to have\r\npaid for a translation of the code of Gentoo laws. I was then in the\r\nprime of my life, flowing in money, and had great expectations: I am now\r\nold; I cannot afford to be generous: I will look back into all my former\r\naccounts, pen, ink, wax, everything that I generously or prodigally\r\nspent as my own humor might suggest; and though, at the same time, I\r\nknow you have given me a noble allowance, I now make a charge upon you\r\nfor this sum of money, and intend to take a bribe in discharge of it.\"\r\nNow suppose Lord Cornwallis, who sits in the seat, and I hope will long,\r\nand honorably and worthily, fill the seat, which that gentleman\r\npossessed,--suppose Lord Cornwallis, after never having complained of\r\nthe insufficiency of his salary, and after having but two years ago said\r\nhe had saved a sufficient competency out of it, should now tell you that\r\n30,00_l._ a year was not enough for him, and that he was sinking into\r\nwant and distress, and should justify upon that alleged want taking a\r\nbribe, and then make out a bill of contingent expenses to cover it,\r\nwould your Lordships bear this?\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings has told you that he wanted to borrow money for his own\r\nuse, and that he applied to Rajah Nobkissin, who generously pressed it\r\nupon him as a gift. Rajah Nobkissin is a banian: you will be astonished\r\nto hear of generosity in a banian; there never was a banian and\r\ngenerosity united together: but Nobkissin loses his banian qualities at\r\nonce, the moment the light of Mr. Hastings's face beams upon him.\r\n\"Here,\" says Mr. Hastings, \"I have prepared bonds for you.\"\r\n\"Astonishing! how can you think of the meanness of bonds? You call upon\r\nme to lend you 34,000_l._, and propose bonds? No, you shall have it: you\r\nare the Governor-General, who have a large and ample salary; but I know\r\nyou are a generous man, and I emulate your generosity: I give you all\r\nthis money.\" Nobkissin was quite shocked at Mr. Hastings's offering him\r\na bond. My Lords, a Gentoo banian is a person a little lower, a little\r\nmore penurious, a little more exacting, a little more cunning, a little\r\nmore money-making, than a Jew. There is not a Jew in the meanest corner\r\nof Duke's Place in London that is so crafty, so much a usurer, so\r\nskilful how to turn money to profit, and so resolved not to give any\r\nmoney but for profit, as a Gentoo broker of the class I have mentioned.\r\nBut this man, however, at once grows generous, and will not suffer a\r\nbond to be given to him; and Mr. Hastings, accordingly, is thrown into\r\nvery great distress. You see sentiment always prevailing in Mr.\r\nHastings. The sentimental dialogue which must have passed between him\r\nand a Gentoo broker would have charmed every one that has a taste for\r\npathos and sentiment. Mr. Hastings was pressed to receive the money as a\r\ngift. He really does not know what to do: whether to insist upon giving\r\na bond or not,--whether he shall take the money for his own use, or\r\nwhether he shall take it for the Company's use. But it may be said of\r\nman as it is said of woman: the woman who deliberates is lost: the man\r\nthat deliberates about receiving bribes is gone. The moment he\r\ndeliberates, that moment his reason, the fortress, is lost, the walls\r\nshake, down it comes,--and at the same moment enters Nobkissin into the\r\ncitadel of his honor and integrity, with colors flying, with drums\r\nbeating, and Mr. Hastings's garrison goes out, very handsomely indeed,\r\nwith the honors of war, all for the benefit of the Company. Mr. Hastings\r\nconsents to take the money from Nobkissin; Nobkissin gives the money,\r\nand is perfectly satisfied.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings took the money with a view to apply it to the Company's\r\nservice. How? To pay his own contingent bills. \"Everything that I do,\"\r\nsays he, \"and all the money I squander, is all for the Company's\r\nbenefit. As to particulars of accounts, never look into them; they are\r\ngiven you upon honor. Let me take this bribe: it costs you nothing to be\r\njust or generous. I take the bribe: you sanctify it.\" But in every\r\ntransaction of Mr. Hastings, where we have got a name, there we have got\r\na crime. Nobkissin gave him the money, and did not take his bond, I\r\nbelieve, for it; but Nobkissin, we find, immediately afterwards enters\r\nupon the stewardship or management of one of the most considerable\r\ndistricts in Bengal. We know very well, and shall prove to your\r\nLordships, in what manner such men rack such districts, and exact from\r\nthe inhabitants the money to repay themselves for the bribes which had\r\nbeen taken from them. These bribes are taken under a pretence of the\r\nCompany's service, but sooner or later they fall upon the Company's\r\ntreasury. And we shall prove that Nobkissin, within a year from the time\r\nwhen he gave this bribe, had fallen into arrears to the Company, as\r\ntheir steward, to the amount of a sum the very interest of which,\r\naccording to the rate of interest in that country, amounted to more than\r\nthis bribe, taken, as was pretended, for the Company's service. Such are\r\nthe consequences of a banian's generosity, and of Mr. Hastings's\r\ngratitude, so far as the interest of the country is concerned; and this\r\nis a good way to pay Mr. Hastings's contingent accounts. But this is not\r\nall: a most detestable villain is sent up into the country to take the\r\nmanagement of it, and the fortunes of all the great families in it are\r\ngiven entirely into his power. This is the way by which the Company are\r\nto keep their own servants from falling into \"the extremity of private\r\nwant.\" And the Company itself, in this pretended saving to their\r\ntreasury by the taking of bribes, lose more than the amount of the\r\nbribes received. Wherever a bribe is given on one hand, there is a\r\nbalance accruing on the other. No man, who had any share in the\r\nmanagement of the Company's revenues, ever gave a bribe, who did not\r\neither extort the full amount of it from the country, or else fall in\r\nbalance to the Company to that amount, and frequently both. In short,\r\nMr. Hastings never was guilty of corruption, that blood and rapine did\r\nnot follow; he never took a bribe, pretended to be for their benefit,\r\nbut the Company's treasury was proportionably exhausted by it.\r\n\r\nAnd now was this scandalous and ruinous traffic in bribes brought to\r\nlight by the Court of Directors? No: we got it in the House of Commons.\r\nThese bribes appear to have been taken at various times and upon various\r\noccasions; and it was not till his return from Patna, in February, 1782,\r\nthat the first communication of any of them was made to the Court of\r\nDirectors. Upon the receipt of this letter, the Court of Directors\r\nwrote back to him, requiring some further explanation upon the subject.\r\nNo explanation was given, but a communication of other bribes was made\r\nin his letter, said to be written in May of the same year, but not\r\ndispatched to Europe till the December following. This produced another\r\nrequisition from the Directors for explanation. And here your Lordships\r\nare to observe that this correspondence is never in the way of letters\r\nwritten and answers given; but he and the Directors are perpetually\r\nplaying at hide-and-seek with each other, and writing to each other at\r\nrandom: Mr. Hastings making a communication one day, the Directors\r\nrequiring an explanation the next; Mr. Hastings giving an account of\r\nanother bribe on the third day, without giving any explanation of the\r\nformer. Still, however, the Directors are pursuing their chase. But it\r\nwas not till they learned that the committees of the House of Commons\r\n(for committees of the House of Commons had then some weight) were\r\nfrowning upon them for this collusion with Mr. Hastings, that at last\r\nsome honest men in the Direction were permitted to have some ascendency,\r\nand that a proper letter was prepared, which I shall show your\r\nLordships, demanding from Mr. Hastings an exact account of all the\r\nbribes that he had received, and painting to him, in colors as strong at\r\nleast as those I use, his bribery, his frauds, and peculations,--and\r\nwhat does them great honor for that moment, they particularly direct\r\nthat the money which was taken from the Nabob of Oude should be carried\r\nto his account. These paragraphs were prepared by the Committee of\r\nCorrespondence, and, as I understand, approved by the Court of\r\nDirectors, but never were sent out to India. However, something was\r\nsent, but miserably weak and lame of its kind; and Mr. Hastings never\r\nanswered it, or gave them any explanation whatever. He now, being\r\nprepared for his departure from Calcutta, and having finished all his\r\nother business, went up to Oude upon a chase in which just now we cannot\r\nfollow him. He returned in great disgust to Calcutta, and soon after set\r\nsail for England, without ever giving the Directors one word of the\r\nexplanation which he had so often promised, and they had repeatedly\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nWe have now got Mr. Hastings in England, where you will suppose some\r\nsatisfactory account of all these matters would be obtained from him.\r\nOne would suppose, that, on his arrival in London, he would have been a\r\nlittle quickened by a menace, as he expresses it, which had been thrown\r\nout against him in the House of Commons, that an inquiry would be made\r\ninto his conduct; and the Directors, apprehensive of the same thing,\r\nthought it good gently to insinuate to him by a letter, written by whom\r\nand how we do not know, that he ought to give some explanation of these\r\naccounts. This produced a letter which I believe in the business of the\r\nwhole world cannot be paralleled: not even himself could be his parallel\r\nin this. Never did inventive folly, working upon conscious guilt, and\r\nthrowing each other totally in confusion, ever produce such a false,\r\nfraudulent, prevaricating letter as this, which is now to be given to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nYou have seen him at Patna, at Calcutta, in the country, on the Ganges:\r\nnow you see him at the waters at Cheltenham; and you will find his\r\nletter from that place to comprehend the substance of all his former\r\nletters, and to be a digest of all the falsity, fraud, and nonsense\r\ncontained in the whole of them. Here it is, and your Lordships will\r\nsuffer it to be read. I must beg your patience; I must acknowledge that\r\nit has been the most difficult of all things to explain, but much more\r\ndifficult to make pleasant and not wearisome, falsity and fraud pursued\r\nthrough all its artifices; and therefore, as it has been the most\r\npainful work to us to unravel fraud and prevarication, so there is\r\nnothing that more calls for the attention, the patience, the vigilance,\r\nand the scrutiny of an exact court of justice. But as you have already\r\nhad almost the whole of the man, do not think it too much to hear the\r\nrest in this letter from Cheltenham. It is dated, Cheltenham, 11th of\r\nJuly, 1785, addressed to William Devaynes, Esquire;[8] and it begins\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\"Sir,--The Honorable Court of Directors, in their general letter to\r\nBengal by the 'Surprise,' dated the 16th of March, 1784, were pleased to\r\nexpress their desire that I should inform them of the periods when each\r\nsum of the presents mentioned in my address of the 22d May, 1782, was\r\nreceived,--what were my motives for withholding the several receipts\r\nfrom the knowledge of the Council, or of the Court of Directors,--and\r\nwhat were my reasons for taking bonds for part of these sums, and for\r\npaying other sums into the treasury as deposits, on my own account.\"\r\n\r\nI wish your Lordships to pause a moment. Here is a letter written in\r\nJuly, 1785. You see that from the 29th of December [November?], 1780,\r\ntill that time, during which interval, though convinced in his own\r\nconscience and though he had declared his own opinion of the necessity\r\nof giving a full explanation of these money transactions, he had been\r\nimposing upon the Directors false and prevaricating accounts of them,\r\nthey were never able to obtain a full disclosure from him.\r\n\r\nHe goes on:--\"I have been kindly apprised that the information required\r\nas above is yet expected from me. I hope that the circumstances of my\r\npast situation, when considered, will plead my excuse for having thus\r\nlong withheld it. The fact is, that I was not at the Presidency when the\r\n'Surprise' arrived; and when I returned to it, my time and attention\r\nwere so entirely engrossed, to the day of my final departure from it, by\r\na variety of other more important occupations, of which, Sir, I may\r\nsafely appeal to your testimony, grounded on the large portion\r\ncontributed by myself of the volumes which compose our Consultations of\r\nthat period,\"--\r\n\r\nThese Consultations, my Lords, to which he appeals, form matter of one\r\nof the charges that the Commons have brought against Mr.\r\nHastings,--namely, a fraudulent attempt to ruin certain persons employed\r\nin subordinate situations under him, for the purpose, by intruding\r\nhimself into their place, of secretly carrying on his own transactions.\r\nThese volumes of Consultations were written to justify that act.\r\n\r\nHe next says,--\"The submission which my respect would have enjoined me\r\nto pay to the command imposed on me was lost to my recollection, perhaps\r\nfrom the stronger impression which the first and distant perusal of it\r\nhad left on my mind, that it was rather intended as a reprehension for\r\nsomething which had given offence in my report of the original\r\ntransaction than an expression of any want of a further elucidation of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nPermit me to make a few remarks upon this extraordinary passage. A\r\nletter is written to him, containing a repetition of the request which\r\nhad been made a thousand times before, and with which he had as often\r\npromised to comply. And here he says, \"It was lost to my recollection.\"\r\nObserve his memory: he can forget the command, but he has an obscure\r\nrecollection that he thought it a reprehension rather than a demand! Now\r\na reprehension is a stronger mode of demand. When I say to a servant,\r\n\"Why have you not given me the account which I have so often asked for?\"\r\nis he to answer, \"The reason I have not given it is because I thought\r\nyou were railing at and abusing me\"?\r\n\r\nHe goes on:--\"I will now endeavor to reply to the different questions\r\nwhich have been stated to me, in as explicit a manner as I am able. To\r\nsuch information as I can give the Honorable Court is fully entitled;\r\nand where that shall prove defective, I will point out the only means by\r\nwhich it may be rendered more complete.\"\r\n\r\nIn order that your Lordships may thoroughly enter into the spirit of\r\nthis letter, I must request that you will observe how handsomely and\r\nkindly these tools of Directors have expressed themselves to him, and\r\nthat even their baseness and subserviency to him were not able to draw\r\nfrom him anything that could be satisfactory to his enemies: for as to\r\nthese his friends, he cares but little about satisfying them, though\r\nthey call upon him in consequence of his own promise; and this he calls\r\na reprehension. They thus express themselves:--\"Although it is not our\r\nintention to express any doubt of the integrity of the\r\nGovernor-General,--on the contrary, after having received the presents,\r\nwe cannot avoid expressing our approbation of his conduct in bringing\r\nthem to the credit of the Company,--yet we must confess the statement of\r\nthose transactions appears to us in many points so unintelligible, that\r\nwe feel ourselves under the necessity of calling on the Governor-General\r\nfor an explanation, agreeable to his promise voluntarily made to us. We\r\ntherefore desire to be informed of the different periods when each sum\r\nwas received, and what were the Governor-General's motives for\r\nwithholding the several receipts from the knowledge of the Council and\r\nof the Court of Directors, and what were his reasons for taking bonds\r\nfor part of these sums and paying other sums into the treasury as\r\ndeposits upon his own account.\" Such is their demand, and this is what\r\nhis memory furnishes as nothing but a reprehension.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds:--\"First, I believe I can affirm with certainty that\r\nthe several sums mentioned in the account transmitted with my letter\r\nabove mentioned were received at or within a very few days of the dates\r\nwhich are affixed to them in the account. But as this contains only the\r\ngross sums, and each of these was received in different payments, though\r\nat no great distance of time, I cannot therefore assign a great degree\r\nof accuracy to the account.\"--Your Lordships see, that, after all, he\r\ndeclares he cannot make his account accurate. He further adds, \"Perhaps\r\nthe Honorable Court will judge this sufficient\"--that is, this\r\nexplanation, namely, that he can give none--\"for any purpose to which\r\ntheir inquiry was directed; but if it should not be so, I will beg leave\r\nto refer, for a more minute information, and for the means of making any\r\ninvestigation which they may think it proper to direct, respecting the\r\nparticulars of this transaction, to Mr. Larkins, your\r\naccountant-general, who was privy to every process of it, and possesses,\r\nas I believe, the original paper, which contained the only account that\r\nI ever kept of it.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a man who of his bribe accounts cannot give an account in the\r\ncountry where they are carried on. When you call upon him in Bengal, he\r\ncannot give the account, because he is in Bengal; when he comes to\r\nEngland, he cannot give the account here, because his accounts are left\r\nin Bengal. Again, he keeps no accounts himself, but his accounts are in\r\nBengal, in the hands of somebody else: to him he refers, and we shall\r\nsee what that reference produced.\r\n\r\n\"In this, each receipt was, as I recollect, specifically inserted, with\r\nthe name of the person by whom it was made; and I shall write to him to\r\ndesire that he will furnish you with the paper itself, if it is still in\r\nbeing and in his hands, or with whatever he can distinctly recollect\r\nconcerning it.\"--Here are accounts kept for the Company, and yet he does\r\nnot know whether they are in existence anywhere.\r\n\r\n\"For my motives for withholding the several receipts from the knowledge\r\nof the Council or of the Court of Directors, and for taking bonds for\r\npart of these sums, and paying others into the treasury as deposits on\r\nmy own account, I have generally accounted in my letter to the Honorable\r\nthe Court of Directors of the 22d of May, 1782,--namely, that I either\r\nchose to conceal the first receipts from public curiosity by receiving\r\nbonds for the amount, or possibly acted without any studied design which\r\nmy memory at that distance of time could verify, and that I did not\r\nthink it worth my care to observe the same means with the rest. It will\r\nnot be expected that I should be able to give a more correct explanation\r\nof my intentions after a lapse of three years, having declared at the\r\ntime that many particulars had escaped my remembrance; neither shall I\r\nattempt to add more than the clearer affirmation of the facts implied in\r\nthat report of them, and such inferences as necessarily or with a strong\r\nprobability follow them.\"\r\n\r\nYou have heard of that Oriental figure called, in the banian language, a\r\n_painche_, in English, a _screw_. It is a puzzled and studied involution\r\nof a period, framed in order to prevent the discovery of truth and the\r\ndetection of fraud; and surely it cannot be better exemplified than in\r\nthis sentence: \"Neither shall I attempt to add more than the clearer\r\naffirmation of the facts implied in that report of them, and such\r\ninferences as necessarily or with a strong probability follow them.\"\r\nObserve, that he says, not _facts stated_, but _facts implied in the\r\nreport_. And of what was this to be a report? Of things which the\r\nDirectors declared they did not understand. And then the inferences\r\nwhich are to follow these implied facts are to follow them--But how?\r\n_With a strong probability_. If you have a mind to study this Oriental\r\nfigure of rhetoric, the _painche_, here it is for you in its most\r\ncomplete perfection. No rhetorician ever gave an example of any figure\r\nof oratory that can match this.\r\n\r\nBut let us endeavor to unravel the whole passage. First he states, that,\r\nin May, 1782, he had forgotten his motives for falsifying the Company's\r\naccounts; but he affirms the facts contained in the report, and\r\nafterwards, very rationally, draws such inferences as necessarily or\r\nwith a strong probability follow them. And if I understand it at all,\r\nwhich God knows I no more pretend to do than Don Quixote did those\r\nsentences of lovers in romance-writers of which he said it made him run\r\nmad to attempt to discover the meaning, the inference is, \"Why do you\r\ncall upon me for accounts now, three years after the time when I could\r\nnot give you them? I cannot give them you. And as to the papers relating\r\nto them, I do not know whether they exist; and if they do, perhaps you\r\nmay learn something from them, perhaps you may not: I will write to Mr.\r\nLarkins for those papers, if you please.\" Now, comparing this with his\r\nother accounts, you will see what a monstrous scheme he has laid of\r\nfraud and concealment to cover his peculation. He tells them,--\"I have\r\nsaid that the three first sums of the account were paid into the\r\nCompany's treasury without passing through my hands. The second of these\r\nwas forced into notice by its destination and application to the expense\r\nof a detachment which was formed and employed against Mahdajee Sindia,\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Camac, as I particularly\r\napprised the Court of Directors in my letter of the 29th December\r\n[November?], 1780.\" He does not yet tell the Directors from whom he\r\nreceived it: we have found it out by other collateral means.--\"The other\r\ntwo were certainly not intended, when I received them, to be made\r\npublic, though intended for public service, and actually applied to it.\r\nThe exigencies of government were at that time my own, and every\r\npressure upon it rested with its full weight upon my mind. Wherever I\r\ncould find allowable means of relieving those wants, I eagerly seized\r\nthem.\"--Allowable means of receiving bribes! for such I shall prove them\r\nto be in the particular instances.--\"But neither could it occur to me as\r\nnecessary to state on our Proceedings every little aid that I could thus\r\nprocure; nor do I know how I could have stated it without appearing to\r\ncourt favor by an ostentation which I disdained, nor without the chance\r\nof exciting the jealousy of my colleagues by the constructive assertion\r\nof a separate and unparticipated merit, derived from the influence of my\r\nstation, to which they might have had an equal claim.\"\r\n\r\nNow we see, that, after hammering his brains for many years, he does\r\nfind out his motive, which he could not verify at the time,--namely,\r\nthat, if he let his colleagues know that he was receiving bribes, and\r\ngaining the glory of receiving them, they might take it into their heads\r\nlikewise to have their share in the same glory, as they were joined in\r\nthe same commission, enjoyed the same powers, and were subject to the\r\nsame restrictions. It was, indeed, scandalous in Mr. Hastings, not\r\nbehaving like a good, fair colleague in office, not to let them know\r\nthat he was going on in this career of receiving bribes, and to deprive\r\nthem of their share in the glory of it: but they were grovelling\r\ncreatures, who thought that keeping clean hands was some virtue.--\"Well,\r\nbut you have applied some of these bribes to your own benefit: why did\r\nyou give no account of those bribes?\" \"I did not,\" he says, \"because it\r\nmight have excited the envy of my colleagues.\" To be sure, if he was\r\nreceiving bribes for his own benefit, and they not receiving such\r\nbribes, and if they had a liking to that kind of traffic, it is a good\r\nground of envy, that a matter which ought to be in common among them\r\nshould be confined to Mr. Hastings, and he therefore did well to conceal\r\nit; and on the other hand, if we suppose him to have taken them, as he\r\npretends, for the Company's use, in order not to excite a jealousy in\r\nhis colleagues for being left out of this meritorious service, to which\r\nthey had an equal claim, he did well to take bonds for what ought to be\r\nbrought to the Company's account. These are reasons applicable to his\r\ncolleagues, who sat with him at the same board,--Mr. Macpherson, Mr.\r\nStables, Mr. Wheler, General Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr. Francis:\r\nhe was afraid of exciting their envy or their jealousy.\r\n\r\nYou will next see another reason, and an extraordinary one it is, which\r\nhe gives for concealing these bribes from his inferiors. But I must\r\nfirst tell your Lordships, what, till the proof is brought before you,\r\nyou will take on credit,--indeed, it is on his credit,--that, when he\r\nformed the Committee of Revenue, he bound them by a solemn oath, \"not,\r\nunder any name or pretence whatever, to take from any zemindar, farmer,\r\nperson concerned in the revenue, or any other, any gift, gratuity,\r\nallowance, or reward whatever, or anything beyond their salary\"; and\r\nthis is the oath to which he alludes. Now his reason for concealing his\r\nbribes from his inferiors, this Committee, under these false and\r\nfraudulent bonds, he states thus:--\"I should have deemed it particularly\r\ndishonorable to receive for my own use money tendered by men of a\r\ncertain class, from whom I had interdicted the receipt of presents to\r\nmy inferiors, and bound them by oath not to receive them: I was\r\ntherefore more than ordinarily cautious to avoid the suspicion of it,\r\nwhich would scarcely have failed to light upon me, had I suffered the\r\nmoney to be brought to my own house, or that of any person known to be\r\nin trust for me.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here he comes before you, avowing that he knew the practice of\r\ntaking money from these people was a thing dishonorable in itself. \"I\r\nshould have deemed it particularly dishonorable to receive for my own\r\nuse money tendered by men of a certain class, from whom I had\r\ninterdicted the receipt of presents to my inferiors, and bound them by\r\noath not to receive them.\" He held it particularly dishonorable to\r\nreceive them; he had bound others by an oath not to receive them: but he\r\nreceived them himself; and why does he conceal it? \"Why, because,\" says\r\nhe, \"if the suspicion came upon me, the dishonor would fall upon my\r\npate.\" Why did he, by an oath, bind his inferiors not to take these\r\nbribes? \"Why, because it was base and dishonorable so to do; and because\r\nit would be mischievous and ruinous to the Company's affairs to suffer\r\nthem to take bribes.\" Why, then, did he take them himself? It was ten\r\ntimes more ruinous, that he, who was at the head of the Company's\r\ngovernment, and had bound up others so strictly, should practise the\r\nsame himself; and \"therefore,\" says he, \"I was more than ordinarily\r\ncautious.\" What! to avoid it? \"No; to carry it on in so clandestine and\r\nprivate a manner as might secure me from the suspicion of that which I\r\nknow to be detestable, and bound others up from practising.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall prove that the kind of men from whom he interdicted his\r\nCommittee to receive bribes were the identical men from whom he received\r\nthem himself. If it was good for him, it was good for them to be\r\npermitted these means of extorting; and if it ought at all to be\r\npractised, they ought to be admitted to extort for the good of the\r\nCompany. Rajah Nobkissin was one of the men from whom he interdicted\r\nthem to receive bribes, and from whom he received a bribe for his own\r\nuse. But he says he concealed it from them, because he thought great\r\nmischief might happen even from their suspicion of it, and lest they\r\nshould thereby be inclined themselves to practise it, and to break their\r\noaths.\r\n\r\nYou take it, then, for granted that he really concealed it from them? No\r\nsuch thing. His principal confidant in receiving these bribes was Mr.\r\nCroftes, who was a principal person in this Board of Revenue, and whom\r\nhe had made to swear not to take bribes: he is the confidant, and the\r\nvery receiver, as we shall prove to your Lordships. What will your\r\nLordships think of his affirming and averring a direct falsehood, that\r\nhe did it to conceal it from these men, when one of them was his\r\nprincipal confidant and agent in the transaction? What will you think of\r\nhis being more than ordinarily cautious to avoid the suspicion of it? He\r\nought to have avoided the crime, and the suspicion would take care of\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"For these reasons,\" he says, \"I caused it to be transported immediately\r\nto the treasury. There I well knew, Sir, it could not be received,\r\nwithout being passed to some credit; and this could only be done by\r\nentering it as a loan or as a deposit. The first was the least liable to\r\nreflection, and therefore I had obviously recourse to it. Why the\r\nsecond sum was entered as a deposit I am utterly ignorant. Possibly it\r\nwas done without any special direction from me; possibly because it was\r\nthe simplest mode of entry, and therefore preferred, as the transaction\r\nitself did not require concealment, having been already avowed.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, in fact, every word of this is either false or groundless: it\r\nis completely fallacious in every part. The first sum, he says, was\r\nentered as a loan, the second as a deposit. Why was this done? Because,\r\nwhen you enter moneys of this kind, you must enter them under some name,\r\nsome head of account; \"and I entered them,\" he says, \"under these,\r\nbecause otherwise there was no entering them at all.\" Is this true? Will\r\nhe stick to this? I shall desire to know from his learned counsel, some\r\ntime or other, whether that is a point he will take issue upon. Your\r\nLordships will see there were other bribes of his which he brought under\r\na regular official head, namely, _durbar charges_; and there is no\r\nreason why he should not have brought these under the same head.\r\nTherefore what he says, that there is no other way of entering them but\r\nas loans and deposits, is not true. He next says, that in the second sum\r\nthere was no reason for concealment, because it was avowed. But that\r\nfalse deposit was as much concealment as the false loan, for he entered\r\nthat money as his own; whereas, when he had a mind to carry any money to\r\nthe Company's account, he knew how to do it, for he had been accustomed\r\nto enter it under a general name, called durbar charges,--a name which,\r\nin its extent at least, was very much his own invention, and which, as\r\nhe gives no account of those charges, is as large and sufficient to\r\ncover any fraudulent expenditure in the account as, one would think, any\r\nperson could wish. You see him, then, first guessing one thing, then\r\nanother,--first giving this reason, then another; at last, however, he\r\nseems to be satisfied that he has hit upon the true reason of his\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nNow let us open the next paragraph, and see what it is.--\"Although I am\r\nfirmly persuaded that these were my sentiments on the occasion, yet I\r\nwill not affirm that they were. Though I feel their impression as the\r\nremains of a series of thoughts retained on my memory, I am not certain\r\nthat they may not have been produced by subsequent reflection on the\r\nprincipal fact, combining with it the probable motives of it. Of this I\r\nam certain, that it was my design originally to have concealed the\r\nreceipt of all the sums, except the second, even from the knowledge of\r\nthe Court of Directors. They had answered my purpose of public utility,\r\nand I had almost dismissed them from my remembrance.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you will observe in this most astonishing account which he\r\ngives here, that several of these sums he meant to conceal forever, even\r\nfrom the knowledge of the Directors. Look back to his letter of 22d May,\r\n1782, and his letter of the 16th of December, and in them he tells you\r\nthat he might have concealed them, but that he was resolved not to\r\nconceal them; that he thought it highly dishonorable so to do; that his\r\nconscience would have been wounded, if he had done it; and that he was\r\nafraid it would be thought that this discovery was brought from him in\r\nconsequence of the Parliamentary inquiries. Here he says of a discovery\r\nwhich he values himself upon making voluntarily, that he is afraid it\r\nshould be attributed to arise from motives of fear. Now, at last, he\r\ntells you, from Cheltenham, at a time when he had just cause to dread\r\nthe strict account to which he is called this day, first, that he cannot\r\ntell whether any one motive which he assigns, either in this letter or\r\nin the former, were his real motive or not; that he does not know\r\nwhether he has not invented them since, in consequence of a train of\r\nmeditation upon what he might have done or might have said; and, lastly,\r\nhe says, contrary to all his former declarations, \"that he had never\r\nmeant nor could give the Directors the least notice of them at all, as\r\nthey had answered his purpose, and he had dismissed them from his\r\nremembrance.\" \"I intended,\" he says, \"always to keep them secret, though\r\nI have declared to you solemnly, over and over again, that I did not. I\r\ndo not care how you discovered them; I have forgotten them; I have\r\ndismissed them from my remembrance.\" Is this the way in which money is\r\nto be received and accounted for?\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds thus:--\"But when fortune threw a sum of money in my way\r\nof a magnitude which could not be concealed, and the peculiar delicacy\r\nof my situation at the time I received it made me more circumspect of\r\nappearances, I chose to apprise my employers of it, which I did hastily\r\nand generally: hastily, perhaps, to prevent the vigilance and activity\r\nof secret calumny; and generally, because I knew not the exact amount of\r\nwhich I was in the receipt, but not in the full possession. I promised\r\nto acquaint them with the result as soon as I should be in possession of\r\nit; and, in the performance of my promise, I thought it consistent with\r\nit to add to the amount all the former appropriations of the same kind:\r\nmy good genius then suggesting to me, with a spirit of caution which\r\nmight have spared me the trouble of this apology, had I universally\r\nattended to it, that, if I had suppressed them, and they were afterwards\r\nknown, I might be asked what were my motives for withholding a part of\r\nthese receipts from the knowledge of the Court of Directors and\r\ninforming them of the rest, it being my wish to clear up every doubt.\"\r\n\r\nI am almost ashamed to remark upon the tergiversations and\r\nprevarications perpetually ringing the changes in this declaration. He\r\nwould not have discovered this hundred thousand pounds, if he could have\r\nconcealed it: he would have discovered it, lest malicious persons should\r\nbe telling tales of it. He has a system of concealment: he never\r\ndiscovers anything, but when he thinks it can be forced from him. He\r\nsays, indeed, \"I could conceal these things forever, but my conscience\r\nwould not give me leave\": but it is guilt, and not honesty of\r\nconscience, that always prompts him. At one time it is the malice of\r\npeople and the fear of misrepresentation which induced him to make the\r\ndisclosure; and he values himself on the precaution which this fear had\r\nsuggested to him. At another time it is the magnitude of the sum which\r\nproduced this effect: nothing but the impossibility of concealing it\r\ncould possibly have made him discover it. This hundred thousand pounds\r\nhe declares he would have concealed, if he could; and yet he values\r\nhimself upon the discovery of it. Oh, my Lords, I am afraid that sums of\r\nmuch greater magnitude have not been discovered at all! Your Lordships\r\nnow see some of the artifices of this letter. You see the variety of\r\nstyles he adopts, and how he turns himself into every shape and every\r\nform. But, after all, do you find any clear discovery? do you find any\r\nsatisfactory answer to the Directors' letter? does he once tell you from\r\nwhom he received the money? does he tell you for what he received it,\r\nwhat the circumstances of the persons giving it were, or any explanation\r\nwhatever of his mode of accounting for it? No: and here, at last, after\r\nso many years' litigation, he is called to account for his\r\nprevaricating, false accounts in Calcutta, and cannot give them to you.\r\n\r\nHis explanation of his conduct relative to the bonds now only remains\r\nfor your Lordships' consideration. Before he left Calcutta, in July,\r\n1784 [1781?], he says, when he was going upon a service which he thought\r\na service of danger, he indorsed the false bonds which he had taken from\r\nthe Company, declaring them to be none of his. You will observe that\r\nthese bonds had been in his hands from the 9th or 15th of January (I am\r\nnot quite sure of the exact date) to the day when he went upon this\r\nservice, some time in the month of July, 1784 [1781?]. This service he\r\nhad formerly declared he did not apprehend to be a service of danger;\r\nbut he found it to be so after: it was in anticipation of that danger\r\nthat he made this attestation and certificate upon the bonds. But who\r\never saw them? Mr. Larkins saw them, says he: \"I gave them Mr. Larkins.\"\r\nWe will show you hereafter that Mr. Larkins deserves no credit in this\r\nbusiness,--that honor binds him not to discover the secrets of Mr.\r\nHastings. But why did he not deliver them up entirely, when he was going\r\nupon that service? for all pretence of concealment in the business was\r\nnow at an end, as we shall prove. Why did he not cancel these bonds?\r\nWhy keep them at all? Why not enter truly the state of the account in\r\nthe Company's records? \"But I indorsed them,\" he says. \"Did you deliver\r\nthem so indorsed into the treasury?\" \"No, I delivered them indorsed into\r\nthe hands of my bribe-broker and agent.\" \"But why not destroy them, or\r\ngive them up to the Company, and say you were paid, which would have\r\nbeen the only truth in this transaction? Why did you not indorse them\r\nbefore? Why not, during the long period of so many years, cancel them?\"\r\nNo, he kept them to the very day when he was going from Calcutta, and\r\nhad made a declaration that they were not his. Never before, upon any\r\naccount, had they appeared; and though the Committee of the House of\r\nCommons, in the Eleventh Report, had remarked upon all these scandalous\r\nproceedings and prevarications, yet he was not stimulated, even then, to\r\ngive up these bonds. He held them in his hands till the time when he was\r\npreparing for his departure from Calcutta, in spite of the Directors, in\r\nspite of the Parliament, in spite of the cries of his own conscience, in\r\na matter which was now grown public, and would knock doubly upon his\r\nreputation and conduct. He then declares they are not for his own use,\r\nbut for the Company's service. But were they then cancelled? I do not\r\nfind a trace of their being cancelled. In this letter of the 17th of\r\nJanuary, 1785, he says with regard to these bonds, \"The following sums\r\nwere paid into the treasury, and bonds granted for the same in the name\r\nof the Governor-General, in whose possession the bonds remain, with a\r\ndeclaration upon each, indorsed and signed by him, that he has no claim\r\non the Company for the amount either of principal or interest, no part\r\nof the latter having been received.\"\r\n\r\nTo the account of the 22d of May, of the indorsement, is added the\r\ndeclaration upon oath. But why any man need to declare upon oath that\r\nthe money which he has fraudulently taken and concealed from another\r\nperson is not his is the most extraordinary thing in the world. If he\r\nhad a mind to have it placed to his credit as his own, then an oath\r\nwould be necessary; but in this case any one would believe him upon his\r\nword. He comes, however, and says, \"This is indorsed upon oath.\" Oath!\r\nbefore what magistrate? In whose possession were the bonds? Were they\r\ngiven up? There is no trace of that upon the record, and it stands for\r\nhim to prove that they were ever given up, and in any hands but Mr.\r\nLarkins's and his own. So here are the bonds, begun in obscurity and\r\nending in obscurity, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, corruption to\r\ncorruption, and fraud to fraud. This is all we see of these bonds, till\r\nMr. Larkins, to whom he writes some letter concerning them which does\r\nnot appear, is called to read a funeral sermon over them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I am come now near the period of this class of Mr. Hastings's\r\nbribes. I am a little exhausted. There are many circumstances that might\r\nmake me wish not to delay this business by taking up another day at your\r\nLordships' bar, in order to go through this long, intricate scene of\r\ncorruption. But my strength now fails me. I hope within a very short\r\ntime, to-morrow or the next court-day, to finish it, and to go directly\r\ninto evidence, as I long much to do, to substantiate the charge; but it\r\nwas necessary that the evidence should be explained. You have heard as\r\nmuch of the drama as I could go through: bear with my weakness a little:\r\nMr. Larkins's letter will be the epilogue to it. I have already incurred\r\nthe censure of the prisoner; I mean to increase it, by bringing home to\r\nhim the proof of his crimes, and to display them in all their force and\r\nturpitude. It is my duty to do it; I feel it an obligation nearest to my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] See this letter in the Appendix to the Eighth and Sixteenth Charges,\r\nVol. IX. pp. 319-325, in the present edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nON\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH ARTICLE OF CHARGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH DAY: THURSDAY, MAY 7, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--When I had the honor last to address you from this place, I\r\nendeavored to press this position upon your minds, and to fortify it by\r\nthe example of the proceedings of Mr. Hastings,--that obscurity and\r\ninaccuracies in a matter of account constituted a just presumption of\r\nfraud. I showed, from his own letters, that his accounts were confused\r\nand inaccurate. I am ready, my Lords, to admit that there are situations\r\nin which a minister in high office may use concealment: it may be his\r\nduty to use concealment from the enemies of his masters; it may be\r\nprudent to use concealment from his inferiors in the service. It will\r\nalways be suspicious to use concealment from his colleagues and\r\ncoördinates in office; but when, in a money transaction, any man uses\r\nconcealment with regard to them to whom the money belongs, he is guilty\r\nof a fraud. My Lords, I have shown you that Mr. Hastings kept no\r\naccount, by his own confession, of the moneys that he had privately\r\ntaken, as he pretends, for the Company's service, and we have but too\r\nmuch reason to presume for his own. We have shown you, my Lords, that he\r\nhas not only no accounts, but no memory; we have shown that he does not\r\neven understand his own motives; that, when called upon to recollect\r\nthem, he begs to guess at them; and that as his memory is to be supplied\r\nby his guess, so he has no confidence in his guesses. He at first finds,\r\nafter a lapse of about a year and a half, or somewhat less, that he\r\ncannot recollect what his motives were to certain actions which upon the\r\nvery face of them appeared fraudulent. He is called to an account some\r\nyears after, to explain what they were, and he makes a just reflection\r\nupon it,--namely, that, as his memory did not enable him to find out his\r\nown motive at the former time, it is not to be expected that it would be\r\nclearer a year after. Your Lordships will, however, recollect, that in\r\nthe Cheltenham letter, which is made of no perishable stuff, he begins\r\nagain to guess; but after he has guessed and guessed again, and after he\r\nhas gone through all the motives he can possibly assign for the action,\r\nhe tells you he does not know whether those were his real motives, or\r\nwhether he has not invented them since.\r\n\r\nIn that situation the accounts of the Company were left with regard to\r\nvery great sums which passed through Mr. Hastings's hands, and for which\r\nhe, instead of giving his masters credit, took credit to himself, and,\r\nbeing their debtor, as he confesses himself to be at that time, took a\r\nsecurity for that debt as if he had been their creditor. This required\r\nexplanation. Explanation he was called upon for, over and over again;\r\nexplanation he did not give, and declared he could not give. He was\r\ncalled upon for it when in India: he had not leisure to attend to it\r\nthere. He was called upon for it when in Europe: he then says he must\r\nsend for it to India. With much prevarication, and much insolence too,\r\nhe confesses himself guilty of falsifying the Company's accounts by\r\nmaking himself their creditor when he was their debtor, and giving false\r\naccounts of this false transaction. The Court of Directors was slow to\r\nbelieve him guilty; Parliament expressed a strong suspicion of his\r\nguilt, and wished for further information. Mr. Hastings about this time\r\nbegan to imagine his conscience to be a faithful and true\r\nmonitor,--which it were well he had attended to upon many occasions, as\r\nit would have saved him his appearance here,--and it told him that he\r\nwas in great danger from the Parliamentary inquiries that were going on.\r\nIt was now to be expected that he would have been in haste to fulfil the\r\npromise which he had made in the Patna letter of the 20th of January,\r\n1782; and accordingly we find that about this time his first agent,\r\nMajor Fairfax, was sent over to Europe, which agent entered himself at\r\nthe India House, and appeared before the Committee of the House of\r\nCommons, as an agent expressly sent over to explain whatever might\r\nappear doubtful in his conduct. Major Fairfax, notwithstanding the\r\ncharacter in which Mr. Hastings employed him, appeared to be but a\r\nletter-carrier: he had nothing to say: he gave them no information in\r\nthe India House at all: to the Committee (I can speak with the clearness\r\nof a witness) he gave no satisfaction whatever. However, this agent\r\nvanished in a moment, in order to make way for another, more\r\nsubstantial, more efficient agent,--an agent perfectly known in this\r\ncountry,--an agent known by the name given to him by Mr. Hastings, who,\r\nlike the princes of the East, gives titles: he calls him an incomparable\r\nagent; and by that name he is very well known to your Lordships and the\r\nworld. This agent, Major Scott, who I believe was here prior to the\r\ntime of Major Fairfax's arrival in the character of an agent, and for\r\nthe very same purposes, was called before the Committee, and examined,\r\npoint by point, article by article, upon all that obscure enumeration of\r\nbribes which the Court of Directors declare they did not understand; but\r\nhe declared that he could speak nothing with regard to any of these\r\ntransactions, and that he had got no instructions to explain any part of\r\nthem. There was but one circumstance which in the course of his\r\nexamination we drew from him,--namely, that one of these articles,\r\nentered in the account of the 22d of May as a deposit, had been received\r\nfrom Mr. Hastings as a bribe from Cheyt Sing. He produced an extract of\r\na letter relative to it, which your Lordships in the course of this\r\ntrial may see, and which will lead us into a further and more minute\r\ninquiry on that head; but when that committee made their report in 1783,\r\nnot one single article had been explained to Parliament, not one\r\nexplained to the Company, except this bribe of Cheyt Sing, which Mr.\r\nHastings had never thought proper to communicate to the East India\r\nCompany, either by himself, nor, as far as we could find out, by his\r\nagent; nor was it at last otherwise discovered than as it was drawn out\r\nfrom him by a long examination in the Committee of the House of Commons.\r\nAnd thus, notwithstanding the letters he had written and the agents he\r\nemployed, he seemed absolutely and firmly resolved to give his employers\r\nno satisfaction at all. What is curious in this proceeding is, that Mr.\r\nHastings, all the time he conceals, endeavors to get himself the credit\r\nof a discovery. Your Lordships have seen what his discovery is; but Mr.\r\nHastings, among his other very extraordinary acquisitions, has found an\r\neffectual method of concealment through discovery. I will venture to\r\nsay, that, whatever suspicions there might have been of Mr. Hastings's\r\nbribes, there was more effectual concealment in regard to every\r\ncircumstance respecting them in that discovery than if he had kept a\r\ntotal silence. Other means of discovery might have been found, but this,\r\nstanding in the way, prevented the employment of those means.\r\n\r\nThings continued in this state till the time of the letter from\r\nCheltenham. The Cheltenham letter declared that Mr. Hastings knew\r\nnothing of the matter,--that he had brought with him no accounts to\r\nEngland upon the subject; and though it appears by this very letter that\r\nhe had with him at Cheltenham (if he wrote the letter at Cheltenham) a\r\ngreat deal of his other correspondence, that he had his letter of the\r\n22d of May with him, yet any account that could elucidate that letter he\r\ndeclared that he had not; but he hinted that a Mr. Larkins, in India,\r\nwhom your Lordships will be better acquainted with, was perfectly\r\napprised of all that transaction. Your Lordships will observe that Mr.\r\nHastings has all his faculties, some way or other, in deposit: one\r\nperson can speak to his motives; another knows his fortune better than\r\nhimself; to others he commits the sentimental parts of his defence; to\r\nMr. Larkins he commits his memory. We shall see what a trustee of memory\r\nMr. Larkins is, and how far he answers the purpose which might be\r\nexpected, when appealed to by a man who has no memory himself, or who\r\nhas left it on the other side of the water, and who leaves it to another\r\nto explain for him accounts which he ought to have kept himself, and\r\ncircumstances which ought to be deposited in his own memory.\r\n\r\nThis Cheltenham letter, I believe, originally became known, as far as I\r\ncan recollect, to the House of Commons, upon a motion of Mr. Hastings's\r\nown agent: I do not like to be positive upon that point, but I think\r\nthat was the first appearance of it. It appeared likewise in public: for\r\nit was thought so extraordinary and laborious a performance, by the\r\nwriter or his friends, (as indeed it is,) that it might serve to open a\r\nnew source of eloquence in the kingdom, and consequently was printed, I\r\nbelieve, at the desire of the parties themselves. But however it became\r\nknown, it raised an extreme curiosity in the public to hear, when Mr.\r\nHastings could say nothing, after so many years, of his own concerns and\r\nhis own affairs, what satisfaction Mr. Larkins at last would give\r\nconcerning them. This letter was directed to Mr. Devaynes, Chairman of\r\nthe Court of Directors. It does not appear that the Court of Directors\r\nwrote anything to India in consequence of it, or that they directed this\r\nsatisfactory account of the business should be given them; but some\r\nprivate communications passed between Mr. Hastings, or his agents, and\r\nMr. Larkins. There was a general expectation upon this occasion, I\r\nbelieve, in the House of Commons and in the nation at large, to know\r\nwhat would become of the portentous inquiry. Mr. Hastings has always\r\ncontrived to have half the globe between question and answer: when he\r\nwas in India, the question went to him, and then he adjourned his answer\r\ntill he came to England; and when he came to England, it was necessary\r\nhis answer should arrive from India; so that there is no manner of doubt\r\nthat all time was given for digesting, comparing, collating, and making\r\nup a perfect memory upon the occasion.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, Mr. Larkins, who has in custody Mr. Hastings's memory, no\r\nsmall part of his conscience, and all his accounts, did, at last, in\r\ncompliance with Mr. Hastings's desire, think proper to send an account.\r\nThen, at last, we may expect light. Where are we to look for accounts,\r\nbut from an accountant-general? Where are they to be met with, unless\r\nfrom him? And accordingly, in that night of perplexity into which Mr.\r\nHastings's correspondence had plunged them, men looked up to the dawning\r\nof the day which was to follow that star, the little Lucifer, which with\r\nhis lamp was to dispel the shades of night, and give us some sort of\r\nlight into this dark, mysterious transaction. At last the little lamp\r\nappeared, and was laid on the table of this House of Commons, on the\r\nmotion of Mr. Hastings's friends: for we did not know of its arrival. It\r\narrives, with all the intelligence, all the memory, accuracy, and\r\nclearness which Mr. Larkins can furnish for Mr. Hastings upon a business\r\nthat before was nothing but mystery and confusion. The account is\r\ncalled,--\r\n\r\n_\"Copy of the particulars of the dates on which the component parts of\r\nsundry sums included in the account of sums received on the account of\r\nthe Honorable Company by the Governor-General, or paid to their Treasury\r\nby his order, and applied to their service, were received for Mr.\r\nHastings, and paid to the Sub-Treasurer.\"_\r\n\r\nThe letter from Mr. Larkins consisted of two parts: first, what was so\r\nmuch wanted, an account; next, what was wanted most of all to such an\r\naccount as he sent, a comment and explanation. The account consisted of\r\ntwo members: one gave an account of several detached bribes that Mr.\r\nHastings had received within the course of about a year and a half; and\r\nthe other, of a great bribe which he had received in one gross sum of\r\none hundred thousand pounds from the Nabob of Oude. It appeared to us,\r\nupon looking into these accounts, that there was some geography, a\r\nlittle bad chronology, but nothing else in the first: neither the\r\npersons who took the money, nor the persons from whom it was taken, nor\r\nthe ends for which it was given, nor any other circumstances are\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we saw was _Dinagepore_. I believe you know this piece\r\nof geography,--that it is one of the provinces of the kingdom of Bengal.\r\nWe then have a long series of months, with a number of sums added to\r\nthem; and in the end it is said, that on the 18th and 19th of Asin,\r\n(meaning part of September and part of October,) were paid to Mr.\r\nCroftes two lac of rupees; and then remains one lac, which was taken\r\nfrom a sum of three lac six thousand nine hundred and seventy-three\r\nrupees. After we had waited for Mr. Hastings's own account, after it had\r\nbeen pursued through a series of correspondence in vain, after his\r\nagents had come to England to explain it, this is the explanation that\r\nyour Lordships have got of this first article, Dinagepore. Not the\r\nperson paid to, not the person paying, are mentioned, nor any other\r\ncircumstance, except the signature, _G.G.S._: this might serve for\r\n_George Gilbert Sanders_, or any other name you please; and seeing\r\n_Croftes_ above it, you might imagine it was an Englishman. And this,\r\nwhich I call a geographical and a chronological account, is the only\r\naccount we have. Mr. Larkins, upon the mere face of the account, sadly\r\ndisappoints us; and I will venture to say that in matters of account\r\nBengal book-keeping is as remote from good book-keeping as the Bengal\r\n_painches_ are remote from all the rules of good composition. We have,\r\nhowever, got some light: namely, that one G.G.S. has paid some money to\r\nMr. Croftes for some purpose, but from whom we know not, nor where; that\r\nthere is a place called Dinagepore; and that Mr. Hastings received some\r\nmoney from somebody in Dinagepore.\r\n\r\nThe next article is _Patna_. Your Lordships are not so ill acquainted\r\nwith the geography of India as not to know that there is such a place as\r\nPatna, nor so ill acquainted with the chronology of it as not to know\r\nthat there are three months called Baisakh, Asin, Chait. Here was paid\r\nto Mr. Croftes two lac of rupees, and there was left a balance of about\r\ntwo more. But though you learn with regard to the province of Dinagepore\r\nthat there is a balance to be discharged by G.G.S., yet with regard to\r\nPatna we have not even a G.G.S.: we have no sort of light whatever to\r\nknow through whose hands the money passed, nor any glimpse of light\r\nwhatever respecting it.\r\n\r\nYou may expect to be made amends in the other province, called _Nuddea_,\r\nwhere Mr. Hastings had received a considerable sum of money. There is\r\nthe very same darkness: not a word from whom received, by whom received,\r\nor any other circumstance, but that it was paid into the hands of Mr.\r\nHastings's _white banian_, as he was commonly called in that country,\r\ninto the hands of Mr. Croftes, who is his white agent in receiving\r\nbribes: for he was very far from having but one.\r\n\r\nAfter all this inquiry, after so many severe animadversions from the\r\nHouse of Commons, after all those reiterated letters from the\r\nDirectors, after an application to Mr. Hastings himself, when you are\r\nhunting to get at some explanation of the proceedings mentioned in the\r\nletter of the month of May, 1782, you receive here by Mr. Larkins's\r\nletter, which is dated the 5th of August, 1786, this account, which, to\r\nbe sure, gives an amazing light into this business: it is a letter for\r\nwhich it was worth sending to Bengal, worth waiting for with all that\r\nanxious expectation with which men wait for great events. Upon the face\r\nof the account there is not one single word which can tend to illustrate\r\nthe matter: he sums up the whole, and makes out that there was received\r\nfive lac and fifty thousand rupees, that is to say, 55,000_l._, out of\r\nthe sum of nine lac and fifty thousand engaged to be paid: namely,--\r\n\r\nFrom Dinagepore       4,00,000\r\nFrom Nuddea           1,50,000\r\nAnd from Patna        4,00,000\r\n                      --------\r\n                      9,50,000\r\n                      --------\r\n                    Or £95,000\r\n\r\nNow you have got full light! _Cabooleat_ signifies a contract, or an\r\nagreement; and this agreement was, to pay Mr. Hastings, as one should\r\nthink, certain sums of money,--it does not say from whom, but only that\r\nsuch a sum of money was paid, and that there remains such a balance.\r\nWhen you come and compare the money received by Mr. Croftes with these\r\ncabooleats, you find that the cabooleats amount to 95,000_l._, and that\r\nthe receipt has been about 55,000_l._, and that upon the face of this\r\naccount there is 40,000_l._ somewhere or other unaccounted for. There\r\nnever was such a mode of account-keeping, except in the new system of\r\nthis bribe exchequer.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will now see, from this luminous, satisfactory, and clear\r\naccount, which could come from no other than a great accountant and a\r\ngreat financier, establishing some new system of finance, and\r\nrecommending it to the world as superior to those old-fashioned foolish\r\nestablishments, the Exchequer and Bank of England, what lights are\r\nreceived from Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does so happen that from these obscure hints we have been\r\nable to institute examinations which have discovered such a mass of\r\nfraud, guilt, corruption, and oppression as probably never before\r\nexisted since the beginning of the world; and in that darkness we hope\r\nand trust the diligence and zeal of the House of Commons will find light\r\nsufficient to make a full discovery of his base crimes. We hope and\r\ntrust, that, after all his concealments, and though he appear resolved\r\nto die in the last dike of prevarication, all his artifices will not be\r\nable to secure him from the siege which the diligence of the House of\r\nCommons has laid to his corruptions.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will remark, in a paragraph, which, though it stands\r\nlast, is the first in principle, in Mr. Larkins's letter, that, having\r\nbefore given his comment, he perorates, as is natural upon such an\r\noccasion. This peroration, as is usual in perorations, is in favor of\r\nthe parties speaking it, and _ad conciliandum auditorem_. \"Conscious,\"\r\nhe says, \"that the concern which I have had in these transactions needs\r\nneither an apology nor an excuse,\"--that is rather extraordinary,\r\ntoo!--\"and that I have in no action of my life sacrificed the duty and\r\nfidelity which I owed to my honorable employers either to the regard\r\nwhich I felt for another or to the advancement of my own fortune, I\r\nshall conclude this address, firmly relying upon the candor of those\r\nbefore whom it may be submitted for its being deemed a satisfactory as\r\nwell as a circumstantial compliance with the requisition in conformity\r\nto which the information it affords has been furnished,\"--meaning, as\r\nyour Lordships will see in the whole course of the letter, that he had\r\nwritten it in compliance with the requisition and in conformity to the\r\ninformation he had been furnished with by Mr. Hastings,--\"without which\r\nit would have been as base as dishonorable for me spontaneously to have\r\nafforded it: for, though the duty which every man owes to himself should\r\nrender him incapable of making an assertion not strictly true, no man\r\nactuated either by virtuous or honorable sentiments could mistakenly\r\napprehend, that, unless he betrayed the confidence reposed in him by\r\nanother, he might be deemed deficient in fidelity to his employers.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here is, in my opinion, a discovery very well worthy your\r\nLordships' attention; here is the accountant-general of the Company, who\r\ndeclares, and fixes it as a point of honor, that he would not have made\r\na discovery so important to them, if Mr. Hastings himself had not\r\nauthorized him to make it: a point to which he considers himself bound\r\nby his honor to adhere. Let us see what becomes of us, when the\r\nprinciple of honor is so debauched and perverted. A principle of honor,\r\nas long as it is connected with virtue, adds no small efficacy to its\r\noperation, and no small brilliancy and lustre to its appearance: but\r\nhonor, the moment that it becomes unconnected with the duties of\r\nofficial function, with the relations of life, and the eternal and\r\nimmutable rules of morality, and appears in its substance alien to them,\r\nchanges its nature, and, instead of justifying a breach of duty,\r\naggravates all its mischiefs to an almost infinite degree; by the\r\napparent lustre of the surface, it hides from you the baseness and\r\ndeformity of the ground. Here is Mr. Hastings's agent, Mr. Larkins, the\r\nCompany's general accountant, prefers his attachment to Mr. Hastings to\r\nhis duty to the Company. Instead of the account which he ought to give\r\nto them in consequence of the trust reposed in him, he thinks himself\r\nbound by honor to Mr. Hastings, if Mr. Hastings had not called for that\r\nexplanation, not to have given it: so that, whatever obscurity is in\r\nthis explanation, it is because Mr. Hastings did not authorize or\r\nrequire him to give a clearer. Here is a principle of treacherous\r\nfidelity, of perfidious honor, of the faith of conspirators against\r\ntheir masters, the faith of robbers against the public, held up against\r\nthe duty of an officer in a public situation. You see how they are bound\r\nto one another, and how they give their fidelity to keep the secrets of\r\none another, to prevent the Directors having a true knowledge of their\r\naffairs; and I am sure, if you do not destroy this honor of conspirators\r\nand this faith of robbers, that there will be no other honor and no\r\nother fidelity among the servants in India. Mr. Larkins, your Lordships\r\nsee, adheres to the principle of secrecy.\r\n\r\nYou will next remark that Mr. Hastings had as many bribe-factors as\r\nbribes. There was confidence to be reposed in each of them, and not one\r\nof these men appears to be in the confidence of another. You will find\r\nin this letter the policy, the frame, and constitution of this new\r\nexchequer. Mr. Croftes seems to have known things which Mr. Larkins did\r\nnot; Mr. Larkins knew things which Gunga Govind Sing did not; Gunga\r\nGovind Sing knew things which none of the rest of the confederates knew.\r\nCantoo Baboo, who appears in this letter as a principal actor, was in a\r\nsecret which Mr. Larkins did not know; it appears likewise, that there\r\nwas a Persian moonshee in a secret of which Cantoo Baboo was ignorant;\r\nand it appears that Mr. Palmer was in the secret of a transaction not\r\nintrusted to any of the rest. Such is the labyrinth of this practical\r\n_painche_, or screw, that, if, for instance, you were endeavoring to\r\ntrace backwards some transaction through Major Palmer, you would be\r\nstopped there, and must go back again; for it had begun with Cantoo\r\nBaboo. If in another you were to penetrate into the dark recess of the\r\nblack breast of Cantoo Baboo, you could not go further; for it began\r\nwith Gunga Govind Sing. If you pierce the breast of Gunga Govind Sing,\r\nyou are again stopped; a Persian moonshee was the confidential agent. If\r\nyou get beyond this, you find Mr. Larkins knew something which the\r\nothers did not; and at last you find Mr. Hastings did not put entire\r\nconfidence in any of them. You will see, by this letter, that he kept\r\nhis accounts in all colors, black, white, and mezzotinto; that he kept\r\nthem in all languages,--in Persian, in Bengalee, and in a language\r\nwhich, I believe, is neither Persian nor Bengalee, nor any other known\r\nin the world, but a language in which Mr. Hastings found it proper to\r\nkeep his accounts and to transact his business. The persons carrying on\r\nthe accounts are Mr. Larkins, an Englishman, Cantoo Baboo, a Gentoo, and\r\na Persian moonshee, probably a Mahometan. So all languages, all\r\nreligions, all descriptions of men are to keep the account of these\r\nbribes, and to make out this valuable account which Mr. Larkins gave\r\nyou!\r\n\r\nLet us now see how far the memory, observation, and knowledge of the\r\npersons referred to can supply the want of them in Mr. Hastings. These\r\naccounts come at last, though late, from Mr. Larkins, who, I will\r\nventure to say, let the banians boast what they will, has skill perhaps\r\nequal to the best of them: he begins by explaining to you something\r\nconcerning the present of the ten lac. I wish your Lordships always to\r\ntake Mr. Hastings's word, where it can be had,--or Mr. Larkins's, who\r\nwas the representative of and memory-keeper to Mr. Hastings; and then I\r\nmay perhaps take the liberty of making some observations upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter from William Larkins, Accountant-General of Bengal,\r\nto the Chairman of the East India Company, dated 5th August, 1786._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hastings returned from Benares to Calcutta on the 5th February,\r\n1782. At that time I was wholly ignorant of the letter which on the 20th\r\nJanuary he wrote from Patna to the Secret Committee of the Honorable\r\nthe Court of Directors. The rough draught of this letter, in the\r\nhandwriting of Major Palmer, is now in my possession. Soon after his\r\narrival at the Presidency, he requested me to form the account of his\r\nreceipts and disbursements, which you will find journalized in the\r\n280th, &c., and 307th pages of the Honorable Company's general books of\r\nthe year 1781-2. My official situation as accountant-general had\r\npreviously convinced me that Mr. Hastings could not have made the issues\r\nwhich were acknowledged as received from him by some of the paymasters\r\nof the army, unless he had obtained some such supply as that which he\r\nafterwards, viz., on the 22d May, 1782, made known to me, when I\r\nimmediately suggested to him the necessity of his transmitting that\r\naccount which accompanied his letter of that date, till when the promise\r\ncontained in his letter of 20th January had entirely escaped his\r\nrecollection.\"\r\n\r\nThe first thing I would remark on this (and I believe your Lordships\r\nhave rather gone before me in the remark) is, that Mr. Hastings came\r\ndown to Calcutta on the 5th of February; that then, or a few days after,\r\nhe calls to him his confidential and faithful friend, (not his official\r\nsecretary, for he trusted none of his regular secretaries with these\r\ntransactions,)--he calls him to help him to make out his accounts during\r\nhis absence. You would imagine that at that time he trusted this man\r\nwith his account. No such thing: he goes on with the accountant-general,\r\naccounting with him for money expended, without ever explaining to that\r\naccountant-general how that money came into his hands. Here, then, we\r\nhave the accountant making out the account, and the person accounting.\r\nThe accountant does not in any manner make an objection, and say, \"Here\r\nyou are giving me an account by which it appears that you have expended\r\nmoney, but you have not told me where you received it: how shall I make\r\nout a fair account of debtor and creditor between you and the Company?\"\r\nHe does no such thing. There lies a suspicion in his breast that Mr.\r\nHastings must have taken some money in some irregular way, or he could\r\nnot have made those payments. Mr. Larkins begins to suspect him. \"Where\r\ndid you lose this bodkin?\" said one lady to another, upon a certain\r\noccasion. \"Pray, Madam, where did you find it?\" Mr. Hastings, at the\r\nvery moment of his life when confidence was required, even when making\r\nup his accounts with his accountant, never told him one word of the\r\nmatter. You see he had no confidence in Mr. Larkins. This makes out one\r\nof the propositions I want to impress upon your Lordships' minds, that\r\nno one man did he let into every part of his transactions: a material\r\ncircumstance, which will help to lead your Lordships' judgment in\r\nforming your opinion upon many parts of this cause.\r\n\r\nYou see that Mr. Larkins suspected him. Probably in consequence of those\r\nsuspicions, or from some other cause, he at last told him, upon the 22d\r\nof May, 1782, (but why at that time, rather than at any other time, does\r\nnot appear; and this we shall find very difficult to be accounted\r\nfor,)--he told him that he had received a bribe from the Nabob of Oude,\r\nof 100,000_l._ He informs him of this on the 22d of May, which, when the\r\naccounts were making up, he conceals from him. And he communicates to\r\nhim the rough draught of his letter to the Court of Directors, informing\r\nthem that this business was not transacted by any known secretary of the\r\nCompany, nor with the intervention of any interpreter of the Company,\r\nnor passed through any official channel whatever, but through a\r\ngentleman much in his confidence, his military secretary; and, as if\r\nreceiving bribes, and receiving letters concerning them, and carrying on\r\ncorrespondence relative to them, was a part of military duty, the rough\r\ndraught of this letter was in the hands of this military secretary. Upon\r\nthe communication of the letter, it rushes all at once into the mind of\r\nMr. Larkins, who knows Mr. Hastings's recollection, who knows what does\r\nand what does not escape it, and who had a memory ready to explode at\r\nMr. Hastings's desire, \"Good God!\" says he, \"you have promised the\r\nDirectors an account of this business!\"--a promise which Mr. Larkins\r\nassures the Directors, upon his word, had entirely escaped Mr.\r\nHastings's recollection. Mr. Hastings, it seems, had totally forgotten\r\nthe promise relative to the paltry sum of 100,000_l._ which he had made\r\nto the Court of Directors in the January before; he never once thought\r\nof it, no, not even when he was making up his accounts of that very\r\nidentical sum, till the 22d of May. So that these persons answer for one\r\nanother's bad memory: and you will see they have good reason. Mr.\r\nHastings's want of recollection appears in things of some moment.\r\nHowever lightly he may regard the sum of 100,000_l._, which, considering\r\nthe enormous sums he has received, I dare say he does,--for he totally\r\nforgot it, he knew nothing about it,--observe what sort of memory this\r\nregistrar and accountant of such sums as 100,000_l._ has. In what\r\nconfusion of millions must it be, that such sums can be lost to Mr.\r\nHastings's recollection! However, at last it was brought to his\r\nrecollection, and he thought that it was necessary to give some account\r\nof it. And who is the accountant whom he produces? His own memory is no\r\naccountant. He had dismissed the matter (as he happily expresses it in\r\nthe Cheltenham letter) from his memory. Major Palmer is not the\r\naccountant. One is astonished that a man who had had 100,000_l._ in his\r\nhands, and laid it out, as he pretends, in the public service, has not a\r\nscrap of paper to show for it. No ordinary or extraordinary account is\r\ngiven of it. Well, what is to be done in such circumstances? He sends\r\nfor a person whose name you have heard and will often hear of, the\r\nfaithful Cantoo Baboo. This man comes to Mr. Larkins, and he reads to\r\nhim (be so good as to remark the words) from a Bengal paper the account\r\nof the detached bribes. Your Lordships will observe that I have stated\r\nthe receipt of a number of detached bribes, and a bribe in one great\r\nbody: one, the great _corps d'armée_; the other, flying scouting bodies,\r\nwhich were only to be collected together by a skilful man who knew how\r\nto manage them, and regulate the motions of those wild and disorderly\r\ntroops. When No. 2 was to be explained, Cantoo Baboo failed him; he was\r\nnot worth a farthing as to any transaction that happened when Mr.\r\nHastings was in the Upper Provinces, where though he was his faithful\r\nand constant attendant through the whole, yet he could give no account\r\nof it. Mr. Hastings's moonshee then reads three lines from a paper to\r\nMr. Larkins. Now it is no way even insinuated that both the Bengal and\r\nPersian papers did not contain the account of other immense sums; and,\r\nindeed, from the circumstance of only three lines being read from the\r\nPersian paper, your Lordships will be able, in your own minds, to form\r\nsome judgment upon this business.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed with his letter of explanation. \"The particulars,\"\r\nhe goes on to say, \"of the paper No. 1 were read to me from a Bengal\r\npaper by Mr. Hastings's banian, Cantoo Baboo; and if I am not mistaken,\r\nthe three first lines of that No. 2 were read over to me from a Persian\r\npaper by his moonshee. The translation of these particulars, made by me,\r\nwas, as I verily believe, the first complete memorandum that he ever\r\npossessed of them in the English language; and I am confident, that, if\r\nI had not suggested to him the necessity of his taking this precaution,\r\nhe would at this moment have been unable to have afforded any such\r\ninformation concerning them.\"\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, if he had not got, on the intimation of Mr. Larkins, some\r\nscraps of paper, your Lordships might have at this day wanted that\r\nvaluable information which Mr. Larkins has laid before you.\r\nThese, however, contain, Mr. Larkins says, \"the first\r\ncomplete\"--what?--account, do you imagine?--no, \"the first complete\r\n_memorandum_.\" You would imagine that he would himself, for his own use,\r\nhave notched down, somewhere or other, in short-hand, in Persian\r\ncharacters, short without vowels, or in some other way, _memorandums_.\r\nBut he had not himself even a memorandum of this business; and\r\nconsequently, when he was at Cheltenham, and even here at your bar, he\r\ncould never have had any account of a sum of 200,000_l._, but by this\r\naccount of Mr. Larkins, taken, as people read them, from detached pieces\r\nof paper.\r\n\r\nOne would have expected that Mr. Larkins, being warned that day, and\r\ncautioned by the strange memory of Mr. Hastings, and the dangerous\r\nsituation, therefore, in which he himself stood, would at least have\r\nbeen very guarded and cautious. Hear what he next says upon this\r\nsubject. \"As neither of the other sums passed through his hands, these\"\r\n(meaning the scraps) \"contained no such specification, and consequently\r\ncould not enable him to afford the information with which he has\r\nrequested me to furnish you; and it is more than probable, that, if the\r\naffidavit which I took on the 16th December, 1782, had not exposed my\r\ncharacter to the suspicion of my being capable of committing one of the\r\nbasest trespasses upon the confidence of mankind, I should, at this\r\ndistance of time, have been equally unable to have complied with this\r\nrequest: but after I became acquainted with the insinuation suggested in\r\nthe Eleventh Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons, I\r\nthought it but too probable, that, unless I was possessed of the\r\noriginal memorandum which I had made of these transactions, I might not\r\nat some distant period be able to prove that I had not descended to\r\ncommit so base an action. I have therefore always most carefully\r\npreserved every paper which I possessed regarding these transactions.\"\r\n\r\nYou see that Mr. Hastings had no memorandums of his accounts; you see,\r\nthat, after Mr. Larkins had made his memorandums of them, he had no\r\ndesign of guarding or keeping them; and you will commend those wicked\r\nand malicious committees who by their reports have told an\r\naccountant-general and first public officer of revenue, that, in order\r\nto guard his character from their suspicions, it was necessary that he\r\nshould keep some paper or other of an account. We have heard of the\r\nbase, wicked, and mercenary license that has been used by these\r\ngentlemen of India towards the House of Commons: a license to libel and\r\ntraduce the diligence of the House of Commons, the purity of their\r\nmotives, and the fidelity of their actions, by which the very means of\r\ninforming the people are attempted to be used for the purpose of leaving\r\nthem in darkness and delusion. But, my Lords, when the\r\naccountant-general declares, that, if the House of Commons had not\r\nexpressed, as they ought to express, much diffidence and distrust\r\nrespecting these transactions, and even suspected him of perjury, this\r\nvery day that man would not have produced a scrap of those papers to\r\nyou, but might have turned them to the basest and most infamous of uses.\r\nIf, I say, we have saved these valuable fragments by suspecting his\r\nintegrity, your Lordships will see suspicion is of some use: and I hope\r\nthe world will learn that punishment will be of use, too, in preventing\r\nsuch transactions.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have seen that no two persons knew anything of these\r\ntransactions; you see that even memorandums of transactions of very\r\ngreat moment, some of which had passed in the year 1779, were not even\r\nso much as put in the shape of complete memoranda until May, 1782; you\r\nsee that Mr. Hastings never kept them: and there is no reason to imagine\r\nthat a black banian and a Persian moonshee would have been careful of\r\nwhat Mr. Hastings himself, who did not seem to stimulate his accountants\r\nto a vast deal of exactness and a vast deal of fidelity, was negligent.\r\nYou see that Mr. Larkins, our last, our only hope, if he had not been\r\nsuspected by the House of Commons, probably would never have kept these\r\npapers; and that you could not have had this valuable cargo, such as it\r\nis, if it had not been for the circumstance Mr. Larkins thinks proper to\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nFrom the specimen which we have given of Mr. Hastings's mode of\r\naccounts, of its vouchers, checks, and counter-checks, your Lordships\r\nwill have observed that the mode itself is past describing, and that the\r\nchecks and counter-checks, instead of being put upon one another to\r\nprevent abuse, are put upon each other to prevent discovery and to\r\nfortify abuse. When you hear that one man has an account of receipt,\r\nanother of expenditure, another of control, you say that office is well\r\nconstituted: but here is an office constituted by different persons\r\nwithout the smallest connection with each other; for the only purpose\r\nwhich they have ever answered is the purpose of base concealment.\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed a little further with Mr. Larkins. The first of the\r\npapers from which he took the memoranda was a paper of Cantoo Baboo. It\r\ncontained detached payments, amounting in the whole, with the cabooleat,\r\nor agreement, to about 95,000_l._ sterling, and of which it appears that\r\nthere was received by Mr. Croftes 55,000_l._, and no more.\r\n\r\nNow will your Lordships be so good as to let it rest in your memory what\r\nsort of an exchequer this is, even with regard to its receipts? As your\r\nLordships have seen the economy and constitution of this office, so now\r\nsee the receipt. It appears that in the month of May, 1782, out of the\r\nsums beginning to be received in the month of Shawal, that is in July,\r\n1779, there was, during that interval, 40,000_l._ out of 95,000_l._ sunk\r\nsomewhere, in some of the turnings over upon the gridiron, through some\r\nof those agents and panders of corruption which Mr. Hastings uses. Here\r\nis the _valuable_ revenue of the Company, _which is to supply them in\r\ntheir exigencies, which is to come from sources which otherwise never\r\nwould have yielded it_,--which, though small in proportion to the other\r\nrevenue, yet is a diamond, something that by its value makes amends for\r\nits want of bulk,--falling short by 40,000_l._ out of 95,000_l._ Here is\r\na system made for fraud, and producing all the effects of it.\r\n\r\nUpon the face of this account, the agreement was to yield to Mr.\r\nHastings, some way or other, to be paid to Mr. Croftes, 95,000_l._, and\r\nthere was a deficiency of 40,000_l._ Would any man, even with no more\r\nsense than Mr. Hastings, who wants all the faculties of the human mind,\r\nwho has neither memory nor judgment, any man who was that poor\r\nhalf-idiot creature that Mr. Hastings pretends to be, engage in a\r\ndealing that was to extort from some one or other an agreement to pay\r\n95,000_l._ which was not to produce more than 55,000_l._? What, then, is\r\nbecome of it? Is it in the hands of Mr. Hastings's wicked bribe-brokers,\r\nor in his own hands? Is it in arrear? Do you know anything about it?\r\nWhom are you to apply to for information? Why, to G.G.S.--G.G.S. I find\r\nto be, what indeed I suspected him to be, a person that I have mentioned\r\nfrequently to your Lordships, and that you will often hear of, commonly\r\ncalled Gunga Govind Sing,--in a short word, the wickedest of the whole\r\nrace of banians: the consolidated wickedness of the whole body is to be\r\nfound in this man.\r\n\r\nOf the deficiency which appears in this agreement with somebody or other\r\non the part of Mr. Hastings through Gunga Govind Sing you will expect to\r\nhear some explanation. Of the first sum, which is said to have been paid\r\nthrough Gunga Govind Sing, amounting on the cabooleat to four lac, and\r\nof which no more than two lac was actually received,--that is to say,\r\nhalf of it was sunk,--we have this memorandum only: \"Although Mr.\r\nHastings was extremely dissatisfied with the excuses Gunga Govind Sing\r\nassigned for not paying Mr. Croftes the sum stated by the paper No. 1 to\r\nbe in his charge, he never could obtain from him any further payments\r\non this account.\" Mr. Hastings is exceedingly dissatisfied with those\r\nexcuses, and this is the whole account of the transaction. This is the\r\nonly thing said of Gunga Govind Sing in the account: he neither states\r\nhow he came to be employed, or for what he was employed. It appears,\r\nhowever, from the transaction, as far as we can make our way through\r\nthis darkness, that he had actually received 10,000_l._ of the money,\r\nwhich he did not account for, and that he pretended that there was an\r\narrear of the rest. So here Mr. Hastings's bribe-agent admits that he\r\nhad received 10,000_l._, but he will not account for it; he says there\r\nis an arrear of another 10,000_l._; and thus it appears that he was\r\nenabled to take from somebody at Dinagepore, by a cabooleat, 40,000_l._,\r\nof which Mr. Hastings can get but 20,000_l._: there is cent per cent\r\nloss upon it. Mr. Hastings was so exceedingly dissatisfied with this\r\nconduct of Gunga Govind Sing, that you would imagine a breach would have\r\nimmediately ensued between them. I shall not anticipate what some of my\r\nhonorable friends will bring before your Lordships; but I tell you,\r\nthat, so far from quarrelling with Gunga Govind Sing, or being really\r\nangry with him, it is only a little pettish love quarrel with Gunga\r\nGovind Sing: _amantium iræ amoris integratio est_. For Gunga Govind\r\nSing, without having paid him one shilling of this money, attended him\r\nto the Ganges; and one of the last acts of Mr. Hastings's government was\r\nto represent this man, who was unfaithful even to fraud, who did not\r\nkeep the common faith of thieves and robbers, this very man he\r\nrecommends to the Company as a person who ought to be rewarded, as one\r\nof their best and most faithful servants. And how does he recommend him\r\nto be rewarded? By giving him the estate of another person,--the way in\r\nwhich Mr. Hastings desires to be always rewarded himself: for, in\r\ncalling upon the Company's justice to give him some money for expenses\r\nwith which he never charged them, he desires them to assign him the\r\nmoney upon some person of the country. So here Mr. Hastings recommends\r\nGunga Govind Sing not only to trust, confidence, and employment, which\r\nhe does very fully, but to a reward taken out of the substance of other\r\npeople. This is what Mr. Hastings has done with Gunga Govind Sing; and\r\nif such are the effects of his anger, what must be the effect of his\r\npleasure and satisfaction? Now I say that Mr. Hastings, who, in fact,\r\nsaw this man amongst the very last with whom he had any communication in\r\nIndia, could not have so recommended him after this known fraud, in one\r\nbusiness only, of 20,000_l._,--he could not so have supported him, he\r\ncould not so have caressed him, he could not so have employed him, he\r\ncould not have done all this, unless he had paid to Mr. Hastings\r\nprivately that sum of money which never was brought into any even of\r\nthese miserable accounts, without some payment or other with which Mr.\r\nHastings was and ought to be satisfied, or unless Gunga Govind Sing had\r\nsome dishonorable secret to tell of him which he did not dare to provoke\r\nhim to give a just account of, or, lastly, unless the original agreement\r\nwas that half or a third of the bribe should go to Gunga Govind Sing.\r\n\r\nSuch is this patriotic scheme of bribery, this public-spirited\r\ncorruption which Mr. Hastings has invented upon this occasion, and by\r\nwhich he thinks out of the vices of mankind to draw a better revenue\r\nthan out of any legal source whatever; and therefore he has resolved to\r\nbecome the most corrupt of all Governors-General, in order to be the\r\nmost useful servant to the finances of the Company.\r\n\r\nSo much as to the first article of Dinagepore peshcush. All you have is,\r\nthat G.G.S is Gunga Govind Sing; that he has cheated the public of half\r\nof it; that Mr. Hastings was angry with him, and yet went away from\r\nBengal, rewarding, praising, and caressing him. Are these things to pass\r\nas matters of course? They cannot so pass with your Lordships' sagacity:\r\nI will venture to say that no court, even of _pie-poudre_, could help\r\nfinding him guilty upon such a matter, if such a court had to inquire\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nThe next article is _Patna_. Here, too, he was to receive 40,000_l._;\r\nbut from whom this deponent saith not. At this circumstance Mr. Larkins,\r\nwho is a famous deponent, never hints once. You may look through his\r\nwhole letter, which is a pretty long one, (and which I will save your\r\nLordships the trouble of hearing read at length now, because you will\r\nhave it before you when you come to the Patna business,) and you will\r\nonly find that somebody had engaged to pay him 40,000_l._, and that but\r\nhalf of this sum was received. You want an explanation of this. You have\r\nseen the kind of explanation given in the former case, a conjectural\r\nexplanation of G.G.S. But when you come to the present case, who the\r\nperson paying was, why the money was not paid, what the cause of failure\r\nwas, you are not told: you only learn that there was that sum deficient;\r\nand Mr. Larkins, who is our last resort and final hope of elucidation in\r\nthis transaction, throws not the smallest glimpse of light upon it. We\r\nof the House of Commons have been reduced to form the best legitimate\r\nconjectures we could upon this business, and those conjectures have led\r\nus to further evidence, which will enable us to fix one of the most\r\nscandalous and most mischievous bribes, in all the circumstances of it,\r\nupon Mr. Hastings, that was ever known. If he extorted 40,000_l._ under\r\npretence of the Company's service, here is again another failure of half\r\nthe money. Oh, my Lords, you will find that even the remaining part was\r\npurchased with the loss of one of the best revenues in India, and with\r\nthe grievous distress of a country that deserved well your protection,\r\ninstead of being robbed to give 20,000_l._ to the Company, and another\r\n20,000_l._ to some robber or other, black or white. When I say, given to\r\nsome other robber, black or white, I do not suppose that either\r\ngenerosity, friendship, or even communion, can exist in that country\r\nbetween white men and black: no, their colors are not more adverse than\r\ntheir characters and tempers. There is not that _idem velle et idem\r\nnolle_, there are none of those habits of life, nothing, that can bind\r\nmen together even in the most ordinary society: the mutual means of such\r\nan union do not exist between them. It is a money-dealing, and a\r\nmoney-dealing only, which can exist between them; and when you hear that\r\na black man is favored, and that 20,000_l._ is pretended to be left in\r\nhis hands, do not believe it: indeed, you cannot believe it; for we will\r\nbring evidence to show that there is no friendship between those\r\npeople,--and that, when black men give money to a white man, it is a\r\nbribe,--and that, when money is given to a black man, he is only a\r\nsharer with the white man in their infamous profits. We find, however,\r\nsomebody, anonymous, with 20,000_l._ left in his hands; and when we come\r\nto discover who the man is, and the final balance which appears against\r\nhim in his account with the Company, we find that for this 20,000_l._,\r\nwhich was received for the Company, they paid such a compound interest\r\nas was never before paid for money advanced: the most violently griping\r\nusurer, in dealing with the most extravagant heir, never made such a\r\nbargain as Mr. Hastings has made for the Company by this bribe.\r\nTherefore it could be nothing but fraud that could have got him to have\r\nundertaken such a revenue. This evidently shows the whole to be a\r\npretence to cover fraud, and not a weak attempt to raise a revenue,--and\r\nthat Mr. Hastings was not that idiot he represents himself to be, a man\r\nforgetting all his offices, all his duties, all his own affairs, and all\r\nthe public affairs. He does not, however, forget how to make a bargain\r\nto get money; but when the money is to be recovered for the Company, (as\r\nhe says,) he forgets to recover it: so that the accuracy with which he\r\nbegins a bribe, _acribus initiis et soporosâ fine_, and the carelessness\r\nwith which he ends it, are things that characterize, not weakness and\r\nstupidity, but fraud.\r\n\r\nThe next article we proceed to is _Nuddea_. Here we have more light; but\r\ndoes Mr. Larkins anywhere tell you anything about Nuddea? No it appears\r\nas if the account had been paid up, and that the cabooleat and the\r\npayments answer and tally with each other; yet, when we come to produce\r\nthe evidence upon these parts, you will see most abundant reason to be\r\nassured that there is much more concealed than is given in this\r\naccount,--that it is an account current, and not an account\r\nclosed,--and that the agreement was for some other and greater sum than\r\nappears. It might be expected that the Company would inquire of Mr.\r\nHastings, and ask, \"From whom did he get it? Who has received it? Who is\r\nto answer for it?\" But he knew that they were not likely to make any\r\ninquiry at all,--they are not that kind of people. You would imagine\r\nthat a mercantile body would have some of the mercantile excellencies,\r\nand even you would allow them perhaps some of the mercantile faults. But\r\nthey have, like Mr. Hastings, forgotten totally the mercantile\r\ncharacter; and, accordingly, neither accuracy nor fidelity of account do\r\nthey ever require of Mr. Hastings. They have too much confidence in him;\r\nand he, accordingly, acts like a man in whom such confidence, without\r\nreason, is reposed.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships may perhaps suppose that the payment of this money was an\r\nact of friendship and generosity in the people of the country. No: we\r\nhave found out, and shall prove, from whom he got it; at least we shall\r\nproduce such a conjecture upon it as your Lordships will think us bound\r\nto do, when we have such an account before us. Here on the face of the\r\naccount there is no deficiency; but when we look into it, we find\r\nskulking in a corner a person called Nundulol, from whom there is\r\nreceived 58,000 rupees. You will find that he, who appears to have paid\r\nup this money, and which Mr. Hastings spent as he pleased in his journey\r\nto Benares, and who consequently must have had some trust reposed in\r\nhim, was the wickedest of men, next to those I have mentioned,--always\r\ngiving the first rank to Gunga Govind Sing, _primus inter pares_, the\r\nsecond to Debi Sing, the third to Cantoo Baboo: this man is fit to be\r\none next on a par with them. Mr. Larkins, when he comes to explain this\r\narticle, says, \"I believe it is for a part of the Dinagepore peshcush,\r\nwhich would reduce the balance to about 5,000_l._\": but he does not\r\npretend to know what it is given for; he gives several guesses at it;\r\n\"but,\" he says, \"as I do not know, I shall not pretend to give more than\r\nmy conjecture upon it.\" He is in the right; because we shall prove\r\nNundulol never did have any thing to do with the Dinagepore peshcush.\r\nThese are very extraordinary proceedings. It is my business simply to\r\nstate them to your Lordships now; we will give them in afterwards in\r\nevidence, and I will leave that evidence to be confirmed and fortified\r\nby further observations.\r\n\r\nOne of the objects of Mr. Larkins's letter is to illustrate the bonds.\r\nHe says, \"The two first stated sums\" (namely, Dinagepore and Patna, in\r\nthe paper marked No. 1, I suppose, for he seems to explain it to be\r\nsuch) \"are sums for a part of which Mr. Hastings took two bonds: viz.,\r\nNo. 1539, dated 1st October, 1780, and No. 1540, dated 2d October, 1780,\r\neach for the sum of current rupees 1,16,000, or sicca rupees one lac.\r\nThe remainder of that amount was carried to the credit of the head,\r\n_Four per Cent Remittance Loan:_ Mr. Hastings having taken a bond for\r\nit, (No. 89,) which has been since completely liquidated, conformable to\r\nthe law.\" But before I proceed with the bonds, I will beg leave to\r\nrecall to your Lordships' recollection that Mr. Larkins states in his\r\nletter that these sums were received in November. How does this agree\r\nwith another state of the transaction given by Mr. Hastings, namely,\r\nthat the time of his taking the bonds was the 1st and 2d of October? Mr.\r\nLarkins, therefore, who has thought proper to say that the money was\r\nreceived in the month of November, has here given as extraordinary an\r\ninstance either of fraudulent accuracy or shameful official inaccuracy\r\nas was ever perhaps discovered. The first sums are asserted to be paid\r\nto Mr. Croftes on the 18th and 19th of Asin, 1187. The month of Asin\r\ncorresponds with the month of September and part of October, and not\r\nwith November; and it is the more extraordinary that Mr. Larkins should\r\nmistake this, because he is in an office which requires monthly\r\npayments, and consequently great monthly exactness, and a continual\r\ntransfer from one month to another: we cannot suppose any accountant in\r\nEngland can be more accurately acquainted with the succession of months\r\nthan Mr. Larkins must have been with the comparative state of Bengal and\r\nEnglish months. How are we to account for this gross inaccuracy? If you\r\nhave a poet, if you have a politician, if you have a moralist\r\ninaccurate, you know that these are cases which, from the narrow bounds\r\nof our weak faculties, do not perhaps admit of accuracy. But what is an\r\ninaccurate _accountant_ good for? \"Silly man, that dost not know thy own\r\nsilly trade!\" was once well said: but the trade here is not silly. You\r\ndo not even praise an accountant for being accurate, because you have\r\nthousands of them; but you justly blame a public accountant who is\r\nguilty of a gross inaccuracy. But what end could his being inaccurate\r\nanswer? Why not name October as well as November? I know no reason for\r\nit; but here is certainly a gross mistake: and from the nature of the\r\nthing, it is hardly possible to suppose it to be a mere mistake. But\r\ntake it that it is a mistake, and to have nothing of fraud, but mere\r\ncarelessness; this, in a man valued by Mr. Hastings for being very\r\npunctilious and accurate, is extraordinary.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the bonds. We find a bond taken in the month of Shawal,\r\n1186, or 1779, but the receipt is said to be in Asin, 1780: that is to\r\nsay, there was a year and about three months between the collection and\r\nthe receipt; and during all that period of time an enormous sum of money\r\nhad lain in the hands of Gunga Govind Sing, to be employed when Mr.\r\nHastings should think fit. He employed it, he says, for the Mahratta\r\nexpedition. Now he began that letter on the 29th of November by telling\r\nyou that the bribe would not have been taken from Cheyt Sing, if it had\r\nnot been at the instigation of an exigency which it seems required a\r\nsupply of money, to be procured lawfully or unlawfully. But in fact\r\nthere was no exigency for it before the Berar army came upon the borders\r\nof the country,--that army which he invited by his careless conduct\r\ntowards the Rajah of Berar, and whose hostility he was obliged to buy\r\noff by a sum of money; and yet this bribe was taken from Cheyt Sing long\r\nbefore he had this occasion for it. The fund lay in Gunga Govind Sing's\r\nhands; and he afterwards applied to that purpose a part of this fund,\r\nwhich he must have taken without any view whatever to the Company's\r\ninterest. This pretence of the exigency of the Company's affairs is the\r\nmore extraordinary, because the first receipt of these moneys was some\r\ntime in the year 1779 (I have not got the exact date of the agreement);\r\nand it was but a year before that the Company was so far from being in\r\ndistress, that he declared he should have, at very nearly the period\r\nwhen this bribe became payable, a very large sum (I do not recollect the\r\nprecise amount) in their treasury. I cannot certainly tell when the\r\ncabooleat, or agreement, was made; yet I shall lay open something very\r\nextraordinary upon that subject, and will lead you, step by step, to the\r\nbloody scenes of Debi Sing. Whilst, therefore, Mr. Hastings was carrying\r\non these transactions, he was carrying them on without any reference to\r\nthe pretended object to which he afterwards applied them. It was an old,\r\npremeditated plan; and the money to be received could not have been\r\ndesigned for an exigency, because it was to be paid by monthly\r\ninstalments. The case is the same with respect to the other cabooleats:\r\nit could not have been any momentary exigence which he had to provide\r\nfor by these sums of money; they were paid regularly, period by period,\r\nas a constant, uniform income, to Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nYou find, then, Mr. Hastings first leaving this sum of money for a year\r\nand three months in the hands of Gunga Govind Sing; you find, that, when\r\nan exigence pressed him by the Mahrattas suddenly invading Bengal, and\r\nhe was obliged to refer to his bribe-fund, he finds that fund empty, and\r\nthat, in supplying money for this exigence, he takes a bond for two\r\nthirds of his own money and one third of the Company's. For, as I stated\r\nbefore, Mr. Larkins proves of one of these accounts, that he took, in\r\nthe month of January, for this bribe-money, which, according to the\r\nprinciples he lays down, was the Company's money, three bonds as for\r\nmoney advanced from his own cash. Now this sum of three lacs, instead of\r\nbeing all his own, as it should appear to be in the month of January,\r\nwhen he took the bonds, or two thirds his own and one third the\r\nCompany's, as he said in his letter of the 29th of November, turns out,\r\nby Mr. Larkins's account, paragraph 9, which I wish to mark to your\r\nLordships, to be two thirds the Company's money and one third his own;\r\nand yet it is all confounded under bonds, as if the money had been his\r\nown. What can you say to this heroic sharper disguised under the name of\r\na patriot, when you find him to be nothing but a downright cheat, first\r\ntaking money under the Company's name, then taking their securities to\r\nhim for their own money, and afterwards entering a false account of\r\nthem, contradicting that by another account?--and God knows whether the\r\nthird be true or false. These are not things that I am to make out by\r\nany conclusion of mine; here they are, made out by himself and Mr.\r\nLarkins, and, comparing them with his letter of the 27th, you find a\r\ngross fraud covered by a direct falsehood.\r\n\r\nWe have now done with Mr. Larkins's account of the bonds, and are come\r\nto the other species of Mr. Hastings's frauds, (for there is a great\r\nvariety in them,) and first to Cheyt Sing's bribe. Mr. Larkins came to\r\nthe knowledge of the bond-money through Gunga Govind Sing and through\r\nCantoo Baboo. Of this bribe he was not in the secret originally, but was\r\nafterwards made a confidant in it; it was carried to him; and the\r\naccount he gives of it I will state to your Lordships.\r\n\r\n\"The fourth sum stated in Mr. Hastings's account was the produce of\r\nsundry payments made to me by Sadamund, Cheyt Sing's buckshee, who\r\neither brought or sent the gold mohurs to my house, from whence they\r\nwere taken by me to Mr. Croftes, either on the same night or early in\r\nthe morning after: they were made at different times, and I well\r\nremember that the same people never came twice. On the 21st June, 1780,\r\nMr. Hastings sent for me, and desired that I would take charge of a\r\npresent that had been offered to him by Cheyt Sing's buckshee, under the\r\nplea of atoning for the opposition which he had made towards the payment\r\nof the extra subsidy for defraying part of the expenses of the war, but\r\nreally in the hope of its inducing Mr. Hastings to give up that claim;\r\nwith which view the present had first been offered. Mr. Hastings\r\ndeclared, that, although he would not take this for his own use, he\r\nwould apply it to that of the Company, in removing Mr. Francis's\r\nobjections to the want of a fund for defraying the extra expenses of\r\nColonel Camac's detachment. On my return to the office, I wrote down the\r\nsubstance of what Mr. Hastings had said to me, and requested Mr. James\r\nMiller, my deputy, to seal it up with his own seal, and write upon it,\r\nthat he had then done so at my request. He was no further informed of my\r\nmotive for this than merely that it contained the substance of a\r\nconversation which had passed between me and another gentleman, which,\r\nin case that conversation should hereafter become the subject of\r\ninquiry, I wished to be able to adduce the memorandum then made of it,\r\nin corroboration of my own testimony; and although that paper has\r\nremained unopened to this hour, and notwithstanding that I kept no\r\nmemorandum whatever of the substance thereof, yet, as I have wrote this\r\nrepresentation under the most scrupulous adherence to what I conceived\r\nto be truth, should it ever become necessary to refer to this paper, I\r\nam confident that it will not be found to differ materially from the\r\nsubstance of this representation.\"\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention, that, besides these two bonds, which Mr. Hastings\r\ndeclared to be the Company's, and one bond his own, that he slipped into\r\nthe place of the bond of his own a much better, namely, a bond of\r\nNovember, which he never mentioned to the Company till the 22d of May;\r\nand this bond for current rupees 1,74,000, or sicca rupees 1,50,000, was\r\ntaken for the payment stated in the paper No. 1 to have been made to Mr.\r\nCroftes on the 11th Aghan, 1187, which corresponds to the 23d of\r\nNovember, 1780. This is the Nuddea money, and this is all that you know\r\nof it; you know that this money, for which he had taken this other bond\r\nfrom the Company, was not his own neither, but bribes taken from the\r\nother provinces.\r\n\r\nI am ashamed to be troublesome to your Lordships in this dry affair, but\r\nthe detection of fraud requires a good deal of patience and assiduity,\r\nand we cannot wander into anything that can relieve the mind: if it was\r\nin my power to do it, I would do it. I wish, however, to call your\r\nLordships' attention to this last bribe before I quit these bonds. Such\r\nis the confusion, so complicated, so intricate are these bribe accounts,\r\nthat there is always something left behind, glean never so much from the\r\nparagraphs of Mr. Hastings and Mr. Larkins. \"I could not bring them to\r\naccount,\" says Mr. Larkins. \"They were received before the 1st and 2d of\r\nOctober.\" Why does not the running treasury account give an account of\r\nthem? The Committee of the House of Commons examined whether the running\r\ntreasury account had any such account of sums deposited. No such thing.\r\nThey are said by Mr. Hastings to be deposited in June: they were not\r\ndeposited in October, nor any account of them given till the January\r\nfollowing. \"These bonds,\" says he, \"I could not enter as regular money,\r\nto be entered on the Company's account, or in any public way, until I\r\nhad had an order of the Governor-General and Council.\" But why had not\r\nyou an order of the Governor-General and Council? We are not calling on\r\nyou, Mr. Larkins, for an account of your conduct: we are calling upon\r\nMr. Hastings for an account of his conduct, and which he refers to you\r\nto explain. Why did not Mr. Hastings order you to carry them to the\r\npublic account? \"Because,\" says he, \"there was no other way.\" Every one\r\nwho knows anything of a treasury or public banking-place knows, that if\r\nany person brings money as belonging to the public, that the public\r\naccountant is bound, no doubt, to receive it and enter it as such.\r\n\"But,\" says he, \"I could not do it until the account could be settled,\r\nas between debtor and creditor: I did not do it till I could put on one\r\nside durbar charges, secret service, to such an amount, and balance that\r\nagain with bonds to Mr. Hastings.\" That is, he could not make an entry\r\nregularly in the Company's books until Mr. Hastings had enabled him to\r\ncommit one of the grossest frauds and violations of a public trust that\r\never was committed, by ordering that money of the Company's to be\r\nconsidered as his own, and a bond to be taken as a security for it from\r\nthe Company, as if it was his own.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed with this deposit. What is the substance of Mr. Larkins's\r\nexplanation of it? The substance of this explanation is, that here was a\r\nbribe received by Mr. Hastings from Cheyt Sing, guarded with such\r\nscrupulous secrecy, that it was not carried to the house of Mr. Croftes,\r\nwho was to receive it finally, but to the house of Mr. Larkins, as a\r\nless suspected place; and that it was conveyed in various sums, no two\r\npeople ever returning twice with the various payments which made up that\r\nsum of 23,000_l._ or thereabouts. Now do you want an instance of\r\nprevarication and trickery in an account? If any person should inquire\r\nwhether 23,000_l._ had been paid by Cheyt Sing to Mr. Hastings, there\r\nwas not any one man living, or any person concerned in the transaction,\r\nexcept Mr. Larkins, who received it, that could give an account of how\r\nmuch he received, or who brought it. As no two people are ever his\r\nconfidants in the same transaction in Mr. Hastings's accounts, so here\r\nno two people are permitted to have any share whatever in bringing the\r\nseveral fragments that make up this sum. This bribe, you might imagine,\r\nwould have been entered by Mr. Larkins to some public account, at least\r\nto the fraudulent account of Mr. Hastings. No such thing. It was never\r\nentered till the November following. It was not entered till Mr. Francis\r\nhad left Calcutta. All these corrupt transactions were carried on\r\nprivately by Mr. Hastings alone, without any signification to his\r\ncolleagues of his carrying on this patriotic traffic, as he called it.\r\nYour Lordships will also consider both the person who employs such a\r\nfraudulent accountant, and his ideas of his duty in his office. These\r\nare matters for your Lordships' grave determination; but I appeal to\r\nyou, upon the face of these accounts, whether you ever saw anything so\r\ngross,--and whether any man could be daring enough to attempt to impose\r\nupon the credulity of the weakest of mankind, much more to impose upon\r\nsuch a court as this, such accounts as these are.\r\n\r\nIf the Company had a mind to inquire what is become of all the debts due\r\nto them, and where is the cabooleat, he refers them to Gunga Govind\r\nSing. \"Give us,\" say they, \"an account of this balance that remains in\r\nyour hands.\" \"I know,\" says he, \"of no balance.\" \"Why, is there not a\r\ncabooleat?\" \"Where is it? What are the date and circumstances of it?\r\nThere is no such cabooleat existing.\" This is the case even where you\r\nhave the name of the person through whose hands the money passed. But\r\nsuppose the inquiry went to the payments of the Patna cabooleat. \"Here,\"\r\nthey say, \"we find half the money due: out of forty thousand pounds\r\nthere is only twenty thousand received: give us some account of it.\" Who\r\nis to give an account of it? Here there is no mention made of the name\r\nof the person who had the cabooleat: whom can they call upon? Mr.\r\nHastings does not remember; Mr. Larkins does not tell; they can learn\r\nnothing about it. If the Directors had a disposition, and were honest\r\nenough to the Proprietors and the nation to inquire into it, there is\r\nnot a hint given, by either of those persons, who received the Nuddea,\r\nwho received the Patna, who received the Dinagepore peshcush.\r\n\r\nBut in what court can a suit be instituted, and against whom, for the\r\nrecovery of this balance of 40,000_l._ out of 95,000_l._? I wish your\r\nLordships to examine strictly this account,--to examine strictly every\r\npart, both of the account itself, and Mr. Larkins's explanation: compare\r\nthem together, and divine, if you can, what remedy the Company could\r\nhave for their loss. Can your Lordships believe that this can be any\r\nother than a systematical, deliberate fraud, grossly conducted? I will\r\nnot allow Mr. Hastings to be the man he represents himself to be: he was\r\nsupposed to be a man of parts; I will only suppose him to be a man of\r\nmere common sense. Are these the accounts we should expect from such a\r\nman? And yet he and Mr. Larkins are to be magnified to heaven for great\r\nfinanciers; and this is to be called book-keeping! This is the Bengal\r\naccount saved so miraculously on the 22d of May.\r\n\r\nNext comes the Persian account. You have heard of a present to which it\r\nrefers. It has been already stated, but it must be a good deal farther\r\nexplained. Mr. Larkins states that this account was taken from a paper,\r\nof which three lines, and only three lines, were read to him by a\r\nPersian moonshee; and it is not pretended that this was the whole of it.\r\nThe three lines read are as follows.\r\n\r\n\"From the Nabob\" (meaning the Nabob\r\n  of Oude) \"to the Governor-General,\r\n  six lac                               £60,000\r\n\r\nFrom Hussein Reza Khân and Hyder Beg\r\n  Khân to ditto, three lac               30,000\r\n\r\nAnd ditto to Mrs. Hastings, one lac      10,000.\"\r\n\r\nHere, I say, are the three lines that were read by a Persian moonshee.\r\nIs he a man you can call to account for these particulars? No: he is an\r\nanonymous moonshee; his name is not so much as mentioned by Mr. Larkins,\r\nnor hinted at by Mr. Hastings; and you find these sums, which Mr.\r\nHastings mentions as a sum in gross given to himself, are not so. They\r\nwere given by three persons: one, six lacs, was given by the Nabob to\r\nthe Governor; another, of three lacs more, by Hussein Reza Khân [and\r\nHyder Beg Khân?]; and a third, one lac, by both of them clubbing, as a\r\npresent to Mrs. Hastings. This is the first discovery that appears of\r\nMrs. Hastings having been concerned in receiving presents for the\r\nGovernor-General and others, in addition to Gunga Govind Sing, Cantoo\r\nBaboo, and Mr. Croftes. Now, if this money was not received for the\r\nCompany, is it proper and right to take it from Mrs. Hastings? Is there\r\nhonor and justice in taking from a lady a gratuitous present made to\r\nher? Yet Mr. Hastings says he has applied it all to the Company's\r\nservice. He has done ill, in suffering it to be received at all, if she\r\nhas not justly and properly received it. Whether, in fact, she ever\r\nreceived this money at all, she not being upon the spot, as I can find,\r\nat the time, (though, to be sure, a present might be sent her,) I\r\nneither affirm nor deny, farther than that, as Mr. Larkins says, there\r\nwas a sum of 10,000_l._ from these ministers to Mrs. Hastings. Whether\r\nshe ever received any other money than this, I also neither affirm nor\r\ndeny. But in whatever manner Mrs. Hastings received this or any other\r\nmoney, I must say, in this grave place in which I stand, that, if the\r\nwives of Governors-General, the wives of Presidents of Council, the\r\nwives of the principal officers of the India Company, through all the\r\nvarious departments, can receive presents, there is an end of the\r\ncovenants, there is an end of the act of Parliament, there is an end to\r\nevery power of restraint. Let a man be but married, and if his wife may\r\ntake presents, that moment the acts of Parliament, the covenants, and\r\nall the rest expire. There is something, too, in the manners of the East\r\nthat makes this a much more dangerous practice. The people of the East,\r\nit is well known, have their zenanah, the apartment for their wives, as\r\na sanctuary which nobody can enter,--a kind of holy of holies, a\r\nconsecrated place, safe from the rage of war, safe from the fury of\r\ntyranny. The rapacity of man has here its bounds: here you shall come,\r\nand no farther. But if English ladies can go into these zenanahs and\r\nthere receive presents, the natives of Hindostan cannot be said to have\r\nanything left of their own. Every one knows that in the wisest and best\r\ntime of the Commonwealth of Rome, towards the latter end of it, (I do\r\nnot mean the best time for morals, but the best for its knowledge how to\r\ncorrect evil government, and to choose the proper means for it,) it was\r\nan established rule, that no governor of a province should take his wife\r\nalong with him into his province,--wives not being subject to the laws\r\nin the same manner as their husbands; and though I do not impute to any\r\none any criminality here, I should think myself guilty of a scandalous\r\ndereliction of my duty, if I did not mention the fact to your Lordships.\r\nBut I press it no further: here are the accounts, delivered in by Mr.\r\nLarkins at Mr. Hastings's own requisition.\r\n\r\nThe three lines which were read out of a Persian paper are followed by a\r\nlong account of the several species in which this present was received,\r\nand converted by exchange into one common standard. Now, as these three\r\nlines of paper, which are said to have been read out of a Persian paper,\r\ncontain an account of bribes to the amount of 100,000_l._, and as it is\r\nnot even insinuated that this was the whole of the paper, but rather the\r\ncontrary indirectly implied, I shall leave it for your Lordships, in\r\nyour serious consideration, to judge what mines of bribery that paper\r\nmight contain. For why did not Mr. Larkins get the whole of that paper\r\nread and translated? The moment any man stops in the midst of an\r\naccount, he is stopping in the midst of a fraud.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have one farther remark to make upon these accounts. The\r\ncabooleats, or agreements for the payments of these bribes, amount, in\r\nthe three specified provinces, to 95,000_l._ Do you believe that these\r\nprovinces were thus particularly favored? Do you think that they were\r\nchosen as a little demesne for Mr. Hastings? that they were the only\r\nprovinces honored with his protection, so far as to take bribes from\r\nthem? Do you perceive anything in their local situation that should\r\ndistinguish them from other provinces of Bengal? What is the reason why\r\nDinagepore, Patna, Nuddea, should have the post of honor assigned them?\r\nWhat reason can be given for not taking bribes also from Burdwan, from\r\nBissunpore, in short, from all the sixty-eight collections which\r\ncomprise the revenues of Bengal, and for selecting only three? How came\r\nhe, I say, to be so wicked a servant, that, out of sixty-eight\r\ndivisions, he chose only three to supply the exigencies of the Company?\r\nHe did not do his duty in making this distinction, if he thought that\r\nbribery was the best way of supplying the Company's treasury, and that\r\nit formed the most useful and effectual resource for them,--which he has\r\ndeclared over and over again. Was it right to lay the whole weight of\r\nbribery, extortion, and oppression upon those three provinces, and\r\nneglect the rest? No: you know, and must know, that he who extorts from\r\nthree provinces will extort from twenty, if there are twenty. You have a\r\nstandard, a measure of extortion, and that is all: _ex pede Herculem_:\r\nguess from thence what was extorted from all Bengal. Do you believe he\r\ncould be so cruel to these provinces, so partial to the rest, as to\r\ncharge them with that load, with 95,000_l._, knowing the heavy\r\noppression they were sinking under, and leave all the rest untouched?\r\nYou will judge of what is concealed from us by what we have discovered\r\nthrough various means that have occurred, in consequence both of the\r\nguilty conscience of the person who confesses the fact with respect to\r\nthese provinces, and of the vigor, perseverance and sagacity of those\r\nwho have forced from him that discovery. It is not, therefore, for me to\r\nsay that the 100,000_l._ and 95,000_l._ only were taken. Where the\r\ncircumstances entitle me to go on, I must not be stopped, but at the\r\nboundary where human nature has fixed a barrier.\r\n\r\nYou have now before you the true reason why he did not choose that this\r\naffair should come before a court of justice. Rather than this exposure\r\nshould be made, he to-day would call for the mountains to cover him: he\r\nwould prefer an inquiry into the business of the three seals, into\r\nanything foreign to the subject I am now discussing, in order to keep\r\nyou from the discovery of that gross bribery, that shameful peculation,\r\nthat abandoned prostitution and corruption, which he has practised with\r\nindemnity and impunity to this day, from one end of India to the other.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the only account we have of these transactions stands\r\nDinagepore; and it now only remains for me to make some observations\r\nupon Mr. Hastings's proceedings in that province. Its name, then, and\r\nthat money was taken from it, is all that appears; but from whom, by\r\nwhat hands, by what means, under what pretence it was taken, he has not\r\ntold you, he has not told his employers. I believe, however, I can tell\r\nfrom whom it was taken, and I believe it will appear to your Lordships\r\nthat it must have been taken from the unhappy Rajah of Dinagepore; and I\r\nshall in a very few words state the circumstances attending, and the\r\nservice performed for it: from these you will be able to form a just\r\nopinion concerning this bribe.\r\n\r\nDinagepore, a large province, was possessed by an ancient family, the\r\nlast of which, about the year 1184 of their era, the Rajah Bija Naut,\r\nhad no legitimate issue. When he was at the point of death, he wished to\r\nexclude from the succession to the zemindary his half-brother, Cantoo\r\nNaut, with whom he had lived upon ill terms for many years, by adopting\r\na son. Such an adoption, when a person has a half-brother, as he had, in\r\nmy poor judgment is not countenanced by the Gentoo laws. But Gunga\r\nGovind Sing, who was placed, by the office he held, at the head of the\r\nregistry, where the records were kept by which the rules of succession\r\naccording to the custom of the country are ascertained, became master of\r\nthese Gentoo laws; and through his means Mr. Hastings decreed in favor\r\nof the adoption. We find that immediately after this decree Gunga Govind\r\nSing received a cabooleat on Dinagepore for the sum of 40,000_l._, of\r\nwhich it appears that he has actually exacted 30,000_l._, though he has\r\npaid to Mr. Hastings only 20,000_l._ We find, before the young Rajah had\r\nbeen in possession a year, his natural guardians and relations, on one\r\npretence or another, all turned out of their offices. The peshcush, or\r\nfixed annual rent, payable to the Company for his zemindary, fell into\r\narrear, as might naturally be expected, from the Rajah's inability to\r\npay both his rent and this exorbitant bribe, extorted from a ruined\r\nfamily. Instantly, under pretext of this arrearage, Gunga Govind Sing,\r\nand the fictitious Committee which Mr. Hastings had made for his wicked\r\npurposes, composed of Mr. Anderson, Mr. Shore, and Mr. Croftes, who were\r\nbut the tools, as they tell us themselves, of Gunga Govind Sing, gave\r\nthat monster of iniquity, Debi Sing, the government of this family. They\r\nput this noble infant, this miserable Rajah, together with the\r\nmanagement of the provinces of Dinagepore and Rungpore, into his wicked\r\nand abominable hands, where the ravages he committed excited what was\r\ncalled a rebellion, that forced him to fly from the country, and into\r\nwhich I do not wonder he should be desirous that a political and not a\r\njuridical inquiry should be made. The savage barbarities which were\r\nthere perpetrated I have already, in the execution of my duty, brought\r\nbefore this House and my country; and it will be seen, when we come to\r\nthe proof, whether what I have asserted was the effect either of a\r\ndeluded judgment or disordered imagination, and whether the facts I\r\nstate cannot be substantiated by authentic reports, and were none of my\r\ninvention, and, lastly, whether the means that were taken to discredit\r\nthem do not infinitely aggravate the guilt of the offenders. Mr.\r\nHastings wanted to fly from judicial inquiry; he wanted to put Debi Sing\r\nanywhere but in a court of justice. A court of justice, where a direct\r\nassertion is brought forward, and a direct proof applied to it, is an\r\nelement in which he cannot live for a moment. He would seek refuge\r\nanywhere, even in the very sanctuary of his accusers, rather than abide\r\na trial with him in a court of justice. But the House of Commons was too\r\njust not to send him to this tribunal, whose justice they cannot doubt,\r\nwhose penetration he cannot elude, and whose decision will justify those\r\nmanagers whose characters he attempted to defame.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. We find, that, after the cruel sale of this infant,\r\nwho was properly and directly under the guardianship of the Company,\r\n(for the Company acts as steward and dewan of the province, which office\r\nhas the guardianship of minors,) after he had been robbed of 40,000_l._\r\nby the hands of Gunga Govind Sing, and afterwards, under pretence of his\r\nbeing in debt to the Company, delivered into the hands of that monster,\r\nDebi Sing, Mr. Hastings, by way of anticipation of these charges, and in\r\nanswer to them, has thought proper to produce the certificate from this\r\nunfortunate boy which I will now again read to you.\r\n\r\n     \"I, Radanaut, Zemindar of Purgunnah Havelly Punjera, commonly\r\n     called Dinagepore:--As it has been learnt by me, the mutsuddies,\r\n     and the respectable officers of my zemindary, that the ministers of\r\n     England are displeased with the late Governor, Warren Hastings,\r\n     Esquire, upon the suspicion that he oppressed us, took money from\r\n     us by deceit and force, and ruined the country; therefore we, upon\r\n     the strength of our religion, which we think it incumbent on and\r\n     necessary for us to abide by, following the rules laid down in\r\n     giving evidence, declare the particulars of the acts and deeds of\r\n     Warren Hastings, Esquire, full of circumspection and caution,\r\n     civility and justice, superior to the caution of the most learned,\r\n     and, by representing what is fact, wipe away the doubts that have\r\n     possessed the minds of the ministers of England: that Mr. Hastings\r\n     is possessed of fidelity and confidence, and yielding protection to\r\n     us; that he is clear of the contamination of mistrust and wrong,\r\n     and his mind is free of covetousness or avarice. During the time of\r\n     his administration, no one saw other conduct than that of\r\n     protection to the husbandmen, and justice; no inhabitant ever\r\n     experienced afflictions, no one ever felt oppression from him. Our\r\n     reputations have always been guarded from attacks by his prudence,\r\n     and our families have always been protected by his justice. He\r\n     never omitted the smallest instance of kindness towards us, but\r\n     healed the wounds of despair with the salve of consolation, by\r\n     means of his benevolent and kind behavior, never permitting one of\r\n     us to sink in the pit of despondence. He supported every one by his\r\n     goodness, overset the designs of evil-minded men by his authority,\r\n     tied the hands of oppression with the strong bandage of justice,\r\n     and by these means expanded the pleasing appearance of happiness\r\n     and joy over us. He reëstablished justice and impartiality. We\r\n     were, during his government, in the enjoyment of perfect happiness\r\n     and ease, and many of us are thankful and satisfied. As Mr.\r\n     Hastings was well acquainted with our manners and customs, he was\r\n     always desirous, in every respect, of doing whatever would preserve\r\n     our religious rites, and guard them against every kind of accident\r\n     and injury, and at all times protected us. Whatever we have\r\n     experienced from him, and whatever happened from him, we have\r\n     written without deceit or exaggeration.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, this Radanaut, zemindar of the purgunnah, who, as your\r\nLordships hear, bears evidence upon oath to all the great and good\r\nqualities of the Governor, and particularly to his absolute freedom from\r\ncovetousness,--this person, to whom Mr. Hastings appeals, was, as the\r\nCommittee state, a boy between five and six years old at the time when\r\nhe was given into the hands of Debi Sing, and when Mr. Hastings left\r\nBengal, which was in 1786 [1785?], was between eleven and twelve years\r\nold. This is the sort of testimony that Mr. Hastings produces, to prove\r\nthat he was clear from all sort of extortion, oppression, and\r\ncovetousness, in this very zemindary of Dinagepore. This boy, who is so\r\nobservant, who is so penetrating, who is so accurate in his knowledge of\r\nthe whole government of Mr. Hastings, was, I say, when he left his\r\ngovernment, at the utmost, but eleven years and a half old. Now to what\r\nan extremity is this unhappy man at your bar driven, when, oppressed by\r\nthis accumulative load of corruption charged upon him, and seeing his\r\nbribery, his prevarication, his fraudulent bonds brought before you, he\r\ngives the testimony of this child, who for the greatest part of his time\r\nlived three hundred miles from the seat of Mr. Hastings's government!\r\nConsider the miserable situation of this poor, unfortunate boy, made to\r\nswear, with all the solemnities of his religion, that Mr. Hastings was\r\nnever guilty in his province of any act of rapacity! Such are the\r\ntestimonies, which are there called _razinamas_, in favor of Mr.\r\nHastings, with which all India is said to sound. Do we attempt to\r\nconceal them from your Lordships? No, we bring them forth, to show you\r\nthe wickedness of the man, who, after he has robbed innocence, after he\r\nhas divided the spoil between Gunga Govind Sing and himself, gets the\r\nparty robbed to perjure himself for his sake,--if such a creature is\r\ncapable of being guilty of perjury. We have another razinama sent from\r\nNuddea, by a person nearly under the same circumstances with Radanaut,\r\nnamely, Maha Rajah Dirauje Seo Chund Behadre, only made to differ in\r\nsome expressions from the former, that it might not appear to originate\r\nfrom the same hand. These miserable razinamas he delivers to you as the\r\ncollected voice of the country, to show how ill-founded the impressions\r\nare which committees of the House of Commons (for to them they allude, I\r\nsuppose) have taken concerning this man, during their inquiries into the\r\nmanagement of the affairs of the Company in India.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit this subject, I have only to give you the opinion of Sir\r\nElijah Impey, a name consecrated to respect forever, (your Lordships\r\nknow him in this House as well as I do,) respecting these petitions and\r\ncertificates of good behavior.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"From the reasons and sentiments that they contain,\" &c.[9]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moment an Englishman appears, as this gentleman does, in the\r\nprovince of Dinagepore, to collect certificates for Mr. Hastings, it is\r\na command for them, the people, to say what he pleases.\r\n\r\nAnd here, my Lords, I would wish to say something of the miserable\r\nsituation of the people of that country; but it is not in my commission,\r\nand I must be silent, and shall only request your Lordships to observe\r\nhow this crime of bribery grows in its magnitude. First, the bribe is\r\ntaken, through Gunga Govind Sing, from this infant, for his succession\r\nto the zemindary. Next follows the removal from their offices, and\r\nconsequent ruin, of all his nearest natural relations. Then the delivery\r\nof the province to Debi Sing, upon the pretence of the arrears due to\r\nthe Company, with all the subsequent horrors committed under the\r\nmanagement of that atrocious villain. And lastly, the gross subornation\r\nof perjury, in making this wretched minor, under twelve years of age,\r\nbear testimony upon oath to the good qualities of Mr. Hastings and of\r\nhis government,--this minor, I say, who lived three hundred miles from\r\nthe seat of his government, and who, if he knew anything at all of his\r\nown affairs, must have known that Mr. Hastings was the cause of all his\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have now gone through the whole of what I have in charge. I\r\nhave laid before you the covenants by which the Company have thought fit\r\nto guard against the avarice and rapacity of their Governors. I have\r\nshown that they positively forbid the taking of all sorts of bribes and\r\npresents; and I have stated the means adopted by them for preventing the\r\nevasion of their orders, by directing, in all money transactions, the\r\npublicity of them. I have farther shown, that, in order to remove every\r\ntemptation to a breach of their orders, the next step was the framing a\r\nlegal fiction, by which presents and money, under whatever pretence\r\ntaken, were made the legal property of the Company, in order to enable\r\nthem to recover them out of any rapacious hands that might violate the\r\nnew act of Parliament. I have also stated this act of Parliament. I have\r\nstated Mr. Hastings's sense of it. I have stated the violation of it by\r\nhis taking bribes from all quarters. I have stated the fraudulent bonds\r\nby which he claimed a security for money as his own which belonged to\r\nthe Company. I have stated the series of frauds, prevarications,\r\nconcealments, and all that mystery of iniquity, which I waded through\r\nwith pain to myself, I am sure, and with infinite pain, I fear, to your\r\nLordships. I have shown your Lordships that his evasions of the clear\r\nwords of his covenant and the clear words of an act of Parliament were\r\nsuch as did not arise from an erroneous judgment, but from a corrupt\r\nintention; and I believe you will find that his attempt to evade the law\r\naggravates infinitely his guilt in breaking it. In all this I have only\r\n_opened_ to you the package of this business; I have opened it to\r\nventilate it, and give air to it; I have opened it, that a quarantine\r\nmight be performed,--that the sweet air of heaven, which is polluted by\r\nthe poison it contains, might be let loose upon it, and that it may be\r\naired and ventilated before your Lordships touch it. Those who follow me\r\nwill endeavor to explain to your Lordships what Mr. Hastings has\r\nendeavored to involve in mystery, by bringing proof after proof that\r\nevery bribe that was here concealed was taken with corrupt purposes and\r\nfollowed with the most pernicious consequences. These are things which\r\nwill be brought to you in proof. I have only regarded the system of\r\nbribery; I have endeavored to show that it is a system of mystery and\r\nconcealment, and consequently a system of fraud.\r\n\r\nYou now see some of the means by which fortunes have been made by\r\ncertain persons in India; you see the confederacies they have formed\r\nwith one another for their mutual concealment and mutual support; you\r\nwill see how they reply to their own deceitful inquiries by fraudulent\r\nanswers; you will see that Cheltenham calls upon Calcutta, as one deep\r\ncalls upon another, and that the call which is made for explanation is\r\nanswered in mystery; in short, you will see the very constitution of\r\ntheir minds here developed.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my Lords, in what a situation are we all placed! This\r\nprosecution of the Commons, I wish to have it understood, and I am sure\r\nI shall not be disclaimed in it, is a prosecution not only for the\r\npunishing a delinquent, a prosecution not merely for preventing this and\r\nthat offence, but it is a great censorial prosecution, for the purpose\r\nof preserving the manners, characters, and virtues that characterize the\r\npeople of England. The situation in which we stand is dreadful. These\r\npeople pour in upon us every day. They not only bring with them the\r\nwealth which they have acquired, but they bring with them into our\r\ncountry the vices by which it was acquired. Formerly the people of\r\nEngland were censured, and perhaps properly, with being a sullen,\r\nunsocial, cold, unpleasant race of men, and as inconstant as the climate\r\nin which they are born. These are the vices which the enemies of the\r\nkingdom charged them with: and people are seldom charged with vices of\r\nwhich they do not in some measure partake. But nobody refused them the\r\ncharacter of being an open-hearted, candid, liberal, plain, sincere\r\npeople,--qualities which would cancel a thousand faults, if they had\r\nthem. But if, by conniving at these frauds, you once teach the people of\r\nEngland a concealing, narrow, suspicious, guarded conduct,--if you teach\r\nthem qualities directly the contrary to those by which they have\r\nhitherto been distinguished,--if you make them a nation of concealers, a\r\nnation of dissemblers, a nation of liars, a nation of forgers,--my\r\nLords, if you, in one word, turn them into a people of _banians_, the\r\ncharacter of England, that character which, more than our arms, and more\r\nthan our commerce, has made us a great nation, the character of England\r\nwill be gone and lost.\r\n\r\nOur liberty is as much in danger as our honor and our national\r\ncharacter. We, who here appear representing the Commons of England, are\r\nnot wild enough not to tremble both for ourselves and for our\r\nconstituents at the effect of riches. _Opum metuenda potestas._ We dread\r\nthe operation of money. Do we not know that there are many men who wait,\r\nand who indeed hardly wait, the event of this prosecution, to let loose\r\nall the corrupt wealth of India, acquired by the oppression of that\r\ncountry, for the corruption of all the liberties of this, and to fill\r\nthe Parliament with men who are now the object of its indignation?\r\nTo-day the Commons of Great Britain prosecute the delinquents of India:\r\nto-morrow the delinquents of India may be the Commons of Great Britain.\r\nWe know, I say, and feel the force of money; and we now call upon your\r\nLordships for justice in this cause of money. We call upon you for the\r\npreservation of our manners, of our virtues. We call upon you for our\r\nnational character. We call upon you for our liberties; and hope that\r\nthe freedom of the Commons will be preserved by the justice of the\r\nLords.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] This document cannot be found\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
